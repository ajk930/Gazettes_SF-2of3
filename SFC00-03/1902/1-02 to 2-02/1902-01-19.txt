no_textTHREE million people down In Co
lombia want to tip over the govern
ment. One million are trying to
hold It upright.
They are fighting like cats and
dogs, those hot tempered southerners.
They scratch and claw and growl and
bark and bite. They are Sn a continuous
6taie of fight the year round, and no man
is able to soothe them. Fighting is their
regular dissipation and they dissipate eV-
ery day of thel/ lives. They are on a
steady debauch of temper.
Some people wonder if either side knows
what it wants.
A young man, a native Colombian who
had been educated in the United States,
and who was an officer in the Liberal
army last year, gave this explanation of
the affair the other day. It is from the
Liberals' point of view.

Panama is the gateway of the world,
yet â¢ the old city remains distinctively
Spanish, and for the most part of ancient
civilization. Progress passes through
Panama and leaves but little Impression
In transit, while the record of lost hopes
and many lives Is seen on every hand..
And In no place \ is It more evident than
along the Panama canal. \
- In going from Panama to Colon on the
railroad ' forty-seven miles, one sees miles
of abandoned machinery, and evidence of
millions of dollars spent carelessly and
criminally, too; for hundreds of contracts
were let that no one ever pretended â¢ to
fulfill. The canal is finished twelve miles
. from the Pacific side, and twenty miles
from the Atlantic, at a cost, the Colom
bians will tell you, of $120,000,000, and 850
men to the mile. Fever has stricken them
as they worked. Work is now going on
at* the highest point, "Culebra cut"; 157
feet out of 860 feet are now. through. It
. Is the most * expensive part - of the work,
for the hill Is of hard porphyry.
In the neighborhood of "Culebra" are
-to be constructed seven artificial lakes, or
locks, that will be fed by the water from
- the "deadly Chagres River," - and hun
dreds of small streams besides. The
canal Is 500 feet wide and . 40 feet deep,
and ' this means that much water is
needed. >
Â¦ - "If | the - Americans will only come and
finish the canal, Colombia will be saved
and civilized," is the cry heard from one
end â¢ of ' the isthmus to the other, from
foreigners and natives alike. It makes an
American puff mightily to hear through
'The best landing place and wharf on
the Pacific - Ocean in Central America is
the wharf at La Boca, the terminus of
tne canal. Here airfreight is landed for
the Panama .Canal Company and the
Darien Gold Mining Company. Not far
away Is the large warehouse of the canal
company. It contains all kinds of dredg
ing machinery, boats and old iron, all in
a state of dilapidation. On the hillside is
the "French village," where the work

built, with high stone, foundations, and.
must have-been an object lesson in thrift
and sanitation to the people of Panama.
But now the desolation' Is depressing.
The only mark of French progress Is the
fine hospital, the only one in Panama.
It is well kept and the grounds are the
most beautiful in the environs of the
city. A mile away from the French vil
lage Is the De Lesseps mansion three
stories, overlooking a magnificent ter
raced garden and Panama Bay. Sitting
on the wide porch, breathing the delicious
air and looking down over the beautiful
tropical garden to the blue water of the
bay, smooth as a mirror, reflecting the
islands covered with luxuriant foliage
from the water's edge to their summits,
it was easy to see how the old man
dreamed dreams too wonderful to be
realized.. To-day four native families,
Â¦ with a swarm of twenty-two unclean
children, desecrate the old mansion.
The town of Panama, which lies wait
ing for that dim good fortune in store,
was the first place we. visited on our trip.
It is somewhat of a might-have-been
somewhat of a may-yet-be.
As we approached:.
' "Laik a boat, ladies: laik a boat to Pa
nama?" called the Jamaican boatmen
Chinese, Jamaicans, ' English. Germans
and French, who came into the country
during the Panama canal boom. All
commerce i3 in the hands of foreigners.
The Chinese have the best stores and
are liked the best. As a nondescript citi
zen on the street put It, "The Chinese are
honest traders and accommodating. A
poor man can take 10 cents to a China
man's store and buy ten different arti
cles, while a Colombian would sell him
only two, and no other foreigner here
would make change under 10 cents." .
Facing the four sides of the plaza are
blocks of two and three story buildings,
built In the eighties, the flourishing
times. They are mostly business houses.
One, called: the Bishop's house, is espe
cially imposing. It is three stores high;
on the roof is a large gilded cross that
gleams afar in the dazzling morning sun
shine; the third story has a figure, heroic
size, of "Joseph holding the Infant
Jesus": the second story has a balcony,
and over the ornate railing hang vines
and brilliantly colored flowers.
The old cathedral faces the plaza. It
Is the most Imposing edifice in Panama,
covering a block. It was established In
1575, three years after the present site of
Panama was occupied. The large stone
pillars rise sixty feet from the flagged
floor and are surmounted by a dome
twenty feet higher. â¢ Two towers on the
north end rise another eighty feet and
are good lookout towers in times of in
surrection. There are. seven altars and
eeveral good pictures. One masterpiece
in oil, life size, is "The Flight Into
Egypt." The north and east sides are
lined with ordinary tombstones of mar
ble and granite, memorials of wealthy
citizens.
Panama Is full of Interesting ruins of
old churches, towers" and walls. The
kodak fiend Is satisfied. One old ruin, the
Santa Domingo Church, has a "square"
arch that is a great curiosity to all tour
ists. It is considered a great feat in
architecture for the old Spanish fathers
to have accomplished.
Going through the plaza we met a Pan
ama belle, dressed In the gala attire
of a feast day. She was so pretty and
picturesque that we found an excuse for
talking with her. She had no historical
knowledge. She couldn't tell a thing
about the ancient days of Panama; but.

"Well, get them right over to the Gov
ernor's house and send them along."
"No, senor; it is impossible, the Gover
nor Is having his siesta at this hour of
the day. He will see the telegrams to
morrow. It Is because of the revolution."
We stopped in at a girls' school. Em
broidery and drawn work were all that
appeared to be taught. The teachers,
one a Colombian, the other a Jamaican
mulatto, didn't know anything concern-
Ing the revolution or the history of Pan
ama. They only knew that the first thing
the Government did when it wished to
economize was to stop the public schools.
The teachers looked comparatively Intel
ligent tind were neatly dressed, but bare
footed.
Later, upon leaving the market, wa
were pursued by eight men, each driv
ing a scrawny pony hitched to a sort of
clumsy double phaeton. When we stop
ped the whole procession came to a halt:
if we turned back a block they all fol
lowed. Finally a Jamaican persuaded us
to take his carriage by telling us that he
was an "object of the Queen" and could
speak English. He was shocked to hear
of the great lady's death.
We drove to the cemeteries, six of them
âthe Colombian, the Chinese and the.
French. Bach nationality has two, for
the law compels all bodies to be placed
for eighteen months in a field, after which
they are removed to the cemetery oppo
site; here are found the monuments and
the tombs. The Panama people have a
.strange custom. A family will own a plat
large enough for the grave of the vona
who dies first; the other members of tha
family are placed In due time over this
grave, each one occupying a separata
brick or stone apartment built over the
preceding one. These tombs are more or
less imposing, according to the size of
"Jose Manuel's" family.
Funerals are largely attended, but there
Is no display about them, for all citizens
are borne to the field in the same coffin
known as the coffin of the municipality "

The large dining-room of the hotel, with
its stone floor, high ceiling, latticed win
dows giving a subdued restful light after
the hot glare of the street, seemed very
inviting. We enjoyed the 12 o'clock break
fast and were about to depart greatly re

one of the party.
"Yes, they belong to the house," non

"Yes, like people, they must eat."
"We next wended our way through

2When I looked -around after my" con

black and gold. I could tell that nothlnr
that went on or came out of that door
would escape his attention.
I felt as If I was a part of the Mayor's
office, by this tima, so -I slipped out and
said to the great big unwieldy man as h*
waited, "Are you waiting for any one?"-
His. hands came out of .his pockets and
he said slowly: "Me name is Boyle and
I worked for him over In the Potrerb. I
took him through the gas .works. He
won out big there, ye know. I had to
buck agin all that crowd for Wells. I
keep a saloon over there, ye see? Yes "
as hev saw I was ready to ask another
question; "I was thlnkin' of. the Board
of Public Works. I guess he'll put in a
good many there." I knew I was inter
viewing the office-seeker, the real thing,
so I told him that I hoped he'd get what
he wanted. I saw him twice again
through the day.. The first time he had
ventured to the door and was leaning
over the red velvet counter. The second
he had reached the secretary's big office
and was sitting there; in" a big chair la
the attitude of a man to whom! the min
utes are hours.
The words of a' weak-voiced Irish
woman who stood leaning on the red vel
vet -covered counter \ in ! the anteroom
struck my ear. She was clad in rusty
black and wore a veil that failed to be
beautifying. "Is Mayor Phelan in?" she
asked. And then I knew \ she was not a
politician, or she would .have known' the
ins and outs better. "He is not the Mayor
now," said the polite corporal. "Oh,
shure I tought he was. Ah, now, that's
too bad. Well, can yez tell me if there's
anny money in the treasury? I hev a
bill agin it." She was sent to the Audi
tor's office, and she. had hardly got out
of the door when a tall suffrage looking
female brushed in, walked through the
big office, took | a good look at - the j new
members and the Mayor, who happened
to be in there, and walked out again. As
the door. opened -for. her to pass out I
caught a glimpse of a burly form leaning
ar-ainst the window embrasure that was
exactly opposite the door of the offlco
that has the sign "Mayor" above it in
I saw the blue cap of Corporal Williams
* the door and I. went out to visit with
him while I wae waiting .for all the dig
nitaries to go upstairs for the most pub
lic event of the dayâ the reading by the
Mayor of his inaugural address in the
Supervisors' assembly room.
As I went out into the anteroom I
heard Walter E. Trefts, the rosy cheeked
young stenographer and ' assistant secre
tary to the Mayor, 'say to a visitor, "II
wouldn't be a bad idea for the city to
order a new typewriter, for I expect to"
have very important work during this
administration." *
The man of savoir faire of the crowd,
and who has more medical degrees than
he knows what to do with. Is Dr. J. W.
Ward, the new member of the Board of
Health. . By the way, this gentleman did
not arrive until 12:30 and had a private
presentation and the honor of receiving
his credentials j from the Mayor alone.
- There was straightforward Casey, the
new Commissioner of Public Works, whom
ex-Mayor Phelan remarked that he liked,
and who has a grip of the hand that is
like Iron. Thomas F. Boyle. Election
Commissioner, was a. type of the nervous,
clean cut business man, and his, opposite
was Harry W. Hutton. Police Commis
sioner, a comfortable looking man, yet
with an alert expression of face. There
was he of the name, Louis J. Ohnimus,
Civil Service Commissioner, whom stran
gers who are anxious to get his name
right call "Mr. Anonymous."
John S. Parry, the new Fire Commis
sioner, looks to be a positive sort of a big
fellow, and found the first fault with the
new offices by remarking as Tie started
to sign his bond: "Looks. like that desk
has been vacant for some time: there's no
ink." - 1
Roncovieri is a musician also, the resem
blance does nfct come amiss.
The little body of men who stood be
fore the city's chief executive were of
widely different types. Alfred Roncovierf,
School Director, and A. Altmann could
run a close race on the score of good
looks, and Roncovieri looks enough like
John Philip Sousa to be his double. As
The new Mayor got behind the broad
central desk and received the .Commis
sioners and secretaries who stood in aa
informal group before it. with an inter
ested background of newspaper men and
artists, each one busy. He made a grace
ful little address, well delivered in a
round, full voice, to the new officers. The
Mayor then presented them with their
credentials. H. W. Hutton of the Police
Commission made a little speech, assur
ing the Mayor that all the new appointees
would work together with his Honor for
the good of tlie city and the new admin
istration. A general handshake all around
followed and this important part of the
day's ceremonial was over.

Then the usher came in with a bunch
of telegrams, among them one with the
cor.frratulatlcns of Mayor Snyder of Los

the most of my privilege of being the
Mayor's companion, so I meandered In
and found him sitting at a desk that be
longed to Mayor Sutro (for the late May
or had taken his desk with him) looking
over his inaugural address. All of his
swearing business had been done before
when he filed his bond. He looked well
at his post of office, like a handsome and,
above all, an honest man. I remembered
as I looked at him that a fortune teller
once told me that a large nose was a
sign of executive ability and aggressive
ness. The Mayor has the nose and, I
think, the ability. I asked him later how
the first day as Mayor seemed to him as
far as It had gone. He replied, "Oh.
much the same as other days." That was
the only thing that I heard him say dur
ing the day that was not entirely nat
ural, and I felt like the boy who did not
say much but thought a heap. Inquiries
and cards were coming In all this time
and the desk was growing to look more
and more like a conservatory. To crown
it all, a photographer came in and took
a picture of his Honor sitting amid the
blossoms.
George W. Knox,' the oldest notary in
Ben Francisco, took his .seat behind the
big table and then the hew commission
ers and other appointees who had been
in to extend their congratulations to the
Mayor filed up to swear that they would
support' the constitution and perform the
dutjps of their offices to the best of their
ability. There was not an alarming
amount of formality about the operation,
v.nich was superintended by Abe Ruef,
Thomas Bannerman of the Empire State
Surety Company and George B. Keane.
the quiet young man who will write
autographs and give handshakes for the
Mayor as his private secretary. Every
little while a small procession of con
gTatulatory callers would file through to
the Mayor's private office, headed by a
little dark man who wore diamonds. This
â¢was Marcus Blum, the new usher to the
Mayor. He is a musician alsb and leads
his own band, and he whispered to me
confidentially during one of the lulls of
the day: "I will keep on with the band
just the came. I told the Mayor when I
â¢was appointed that this would be sec
ondary- I have had a band here for
twenty years."
In the interval I began to look around
to see what the material of the new of
ficial family was made of. It was ail
rev. I could see that, and some of It
pretty good looking. I caught all the
portraits cf the various Mayors on the
iva!!s Jcokins: down on the scene, and it
reem^d to me as if they had a surprised
expression on their faces. But the living
pictures around me interested me more.
People began to eift into the big office
of the private secretary and soon the
business cf the day was well on.
If you don't believe it you should have
gone to spend the first official day with
his Honor Mayer Schmitz, as I did. He
entered the doors of the executive cham
bers ast promptly as an orchestra at 9
o'clock on Wednesday morning, January
8, 1902. There were nothing but new
faces there to greet him. There was one
relic of the old administration out in the
anteroom. Police Corporal W. H. Wil
liams, for six years an important fixture
In the Mayor's office â but everybody
knows him. The Mayor came into office
with a cold and nobody could relieve him
of ft. though we all did the best we
could. Some of his official family in the
persons of several newly appointed com
missioners were there to greet him, and
then Abe Ruef. the hardest worked attor
rey in town, came and went Into the
Llaycr's private chamber to congratulate
him and recommend something for his
cold. That meant at least fifteen min
utes of closed doors. ICo one else was In
there but the Mayor's cold.
TO be the brand new, much-discussed
Mayor of a big city like San
Francisco on the first day of a new
administration would seem like a
plcnlc^to most people. That is, in
anticipation. In reality it calls for much
work and a good deal of moral courage.
I always had an idea that the most
arduous duties of the Mayor's first day
In office were to eit in a velvet chair and
receive the salaams of his friends. If
any onÂ© knows who his friends are in
politics.
But in truth the Mayor's first day in
office means to him a processional, stand
up tort of a day, the reception of a con
tinuous "hot air club," speeches ad ln
finitum, lots of flowers, piles of letters
and telegrams with "Hon." or Mayor on
them in capitals, reminders from waiting
friends (?) and Incidentally a good deal
of sub rosa gossip, complimentary and
otherwise, concerning himself. That is
the surface, but of course there's a lot
underneath it all.

Somehow or other with the railing in
front of him and the outline of his hair
done a la pompadour I felt as if he were
going to wave a baton. But he didn't,
and when, with graceful manner, he got
into his well delivered Â¦ address-, I . knew .
that^ many of his qualities were positive
ones^ and that his convictions .were his
own, at least as yet. There were a good
many pompadoured heads scattered
around, and it was too bad that there
was not a fanfare of oboes or trombones
when the executive came in. But the ap
plause he received made up any lack.
Former Mayor Alvord was a prominent
figure swoons the listeners, and he looked
almost as interested as did Abe Ruef, the
new Mayor's attorney. He looked as if
he wouldn't have missed it for anything.
The retiring Mayor was playing the dev
il's tattoo" a good deal on the' desk in
front of him at certain points in his Hon
or's speech, and I decided I would rather
not be the outgoing one, at i?ast not on
the first day. The photographers were
there with their batteries at close range,
and after the close of these ceremonies
they followed his Honor almost to the
luncheon taole. The luncheon was not
flavored with politics. It was rather the
gathering of a small family and the re
counting of the happenings of a red let
ter day for one of the members. Every
one called the Mayor "Gene,'.' whereat
he looked as pleased as Punch. *
with attention as Mr. Thelan \ read his
well-worded valedictory and threw bou
quets until he got to the words, "the re
tiring J Mayor," when some scion of tha
people in" the gallery yelled "Good-by."
But the 'calcium light of public in
terest was all turned on one fig
ure, that of the new Mayor, as he
rose to make his declaration, of pol
icy and good will, with Its note jj of
peace and consideration for the employer
and wage-earner alike. .The politi
cal significance of the opening utterances
on the . threshold of this "musical admin
istration" which is not to be "a one-man
government" was very great, of course,
but the men of the dallies were making
the most, and more, of all that, so I let
nay attention turn wholly to the Mayor
and his characteristics. When he stood
up he completely overshadowed his pre
decessor. 1
And so. the clock hands moved around
to the hour of 5, and promptly on the
minute the handsome Mayor left the City
Hall, bound toward the rest of home after
hia first busy day in office.
In the meantime the afternoon shadows

not a few times. He seemed by this ume
to be the most thoroughly at home of all
those surrounding him, as if he had ex
ercised the many special privileges to
which he was entitled as Mayor for many
years. His faithful lieutenant, Abe .Ruef.
moved briskly in and out, stopping" of ten
for a "give and take" sort of chat.
The newness of the atmosphere was full
of these little incidents, and in the ante
room Corporal "Williams, who, as he told '
me himself. Â¦â¢ has- been-\**twenty-f our years
on the force and never the scratch of a pen <
against him," was having hia hands full.
"But there's nothing new about this; wa
have these things every day." hÂ© said, as
he came out second best from a conversa
tion with a little wizened woman who was
in the wrong office and for the steenth
time. "When I come here to sea the
Mayor, and I ask to see the Mayor. I
wish to see the Mayor. It*Â» maybe you
won't be here always, and It's a good
thing if you wouldn't." That was her
parting shot. There were many charity
applicants, and a pathetic one was an old
woman who said, with a sob In her voice,
"I have worked as long as I can, and
now I have no one but myself and I must
go to the Almshouse. Will thÂ» Mayor
send me there?" James Broadle. tha dis
tinguished looking colored gentleman who
was messenger under the old administra

closet, and that was another old land
mark finally missing.
A sandy looking young man with a
candy mustache was waiting, hoping that
he could get "something to do around the
schoolhousesâ anything he could do." Out
in the anteroom a man told the corporal.
""Well. I've done a heap for him and I
don't want him to forget me." An Italian

PREDERICK WARDE is with

of the legitimate.
We ought to be learning or re
learning a good deal about Shake
speare these days. The past two weeks of
Modjeska and James have kept the dust
from gathering on our Shakespeare-vol
umes: and here, to follow up this matter
of our' classical education, comes our "old
friend with "Julius Caesar" and "King
Lear" "in his repertoire. .
They say. in the East that Shakespeare
is becoming fashionable again. To be
sure, we have not seen the swagger mod
ern productions of the old playwright's
works. Maude Adams kept her Juliet
for the exclusiveness of New. .York, Soth-
em's Hamlet never gave us a chance to
quarrel, no more did Nat Goodwin put ua
down on his route. for "The Merchant of
Venice."' But the old ones who have stood
loyally by the Avon-; gentleman, .', even
through the years when he was on his up
persâthey: do not consider us too remote
to be "visited. So, although we may; not
have Shakespeare up-to-date, still ; . we
have him. :--.. Â¦ "Â¦:-Â¦'"- Â¦.-.Â¦Â¦-: ' - Â¦-.:-, , ...- ;Â¦' Â¦,
VWarde is the same Shakespeare disciple
that he always was. -He has clung to his
ideal through feast and famine. He has
played 1 Shakespeare and I lectured oh
Shakespeare â he has preached him and
studied him and worshiped him. .
He reaches out every once in a while to
take i in some < less ; classical drama, f but
they | are side issues. ; He , has encouraged
modern playwrights a great many times.
He produced "Runnymede," by 'William
Greer Harrison; "The Lion's Mouth," by
Henry Guy Carleton; "Gaston Â¦ Cartel," by
Delia Loganâ these are only "a few of the
recent works; but note that of the four
plays which .he announces for San Fran
ciscoâ "Julius -: v Caesar," "The Mounte
bank," ' "Virginius", and ; "King Lear"â
half of the four, are Shakespearean pro
ductions. CVVarde has lost money year

*jpt N" interesting letter from an art
f I student in Paris tells all about
fâ I how the American devotees to
V, I brush and palette celebrated their
JL Thanksgiving dinner in the Amer
ican association for the benefit of our
students In Paris. "We had arranged for
some good old American sports, a game
of football, one "of baseball and some
races, for Thanksgiving, but our "hearts
were not entirely in it, for most of us
felt like strangers in a strange land with
only a prospect of a lonesome old dinner
in view with nothing to brighten it but a
mental vision of the folks at home hav
ing a big time with turkey and cran
berry. Guess most of us had pretty se
vere attacks of blues about that time,
and it is hard to tell what kind of a day
we would have put in If that consignment
from the Art Students' League in New
York hadn't come as a message from the
old Stars and Stripes. They sent us a
number of real American turkeys. Lord
love 'em. and I tell you we all felt Da
trlotic enough when we saw those' na
tional birds. When the day came at last
It stormed so that we let the games go
and gave ourselves to the feastr and what
a time we had! Before the birds were
dressed and ready to be* roasted all of
us who were present grouped ourselves
on the walk In front of the kitchen and
had a photograph taken together with
the turkeys; later the tables were ar
ranged in the parlor and committee room
and the hundred hungry fellows who sat
down to them were as typical a Thanks
giving gathering as could be found. How
we did eat. and how we cheered when a
monstrous brown turkey was brought in
and set before the President! We hail
cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes and
green corn, too. You tell, that to any of
the fellows who have lived here and they
will know what efforts were made to se
cure that menu. Some of the girls sent
a quantity of pies, mince, pumpkin, lemon
and apple, ana you can Imagine that they
were Riven a vote of thanks. Almost
every toast presented during the dinner
was to those dear pie-senders. After the
dinner we Just sat around the table and
gang every American song we knew;
some of us recited, and when we raked
up all the old college chants it made a
regular American day in every detail."
The same letter tells of a dramatic club
that was organized and how, by the aid
of some of the young lady students, a
performance was given with much suc
cess, socially, dramatically and finan
cially.
A small theater was hired for the occa
sion and an orchestra was composed of
American members. The \ letter says:
"Everybody came and it was good to see
an American audience once more, and to
feel that each clap of applause was not
paid for at so much per clap. During the
evening one or ,. two Frenchmen strayed
in somehow or other, and their surprise
and consternation were comical to behoM
when they saw the strange audience,
which was seemingly all one big family.
Everybody seemed to be talking to every
body else, voices were calling and an
swering each other from all parts of the
house. In fact, everything was' as uncon
ventional and homelike as it could be
Each one of the Parisians stayed until the
show was over, but' I wonder what their
thoughts were when they went home and
what they said when- they were In no
danger of being overheard."

From a Dutch exchange it .Is recorded
that at an art historical congress held in
Amsterdam a lively ' discussion was
brought up by the director of The Hague
Museum, the. subject being the conserva
tion of the neglected art treasures of-
Spain. He claims to have seen a. Murillo
so' utterly neglected that large flakes of
pigment had fallen off the canvas. In
churches he saw valuable, Riberas, of
which half the paint had scaled off: in
Valencia a thousand , or more valuable
paintings were also more or less damaged.
After an animated, discussion" it was.re
solved that. the directors of all the Euro
pean museums should use their influence
on the Spanish Government to save- what
yet could be saved. Another interesting
point brought out In a; lecture before the
Â¦ congress Is that the .red brown found in
so many old paintings had originally been
a green color, the discoloration of which
is ascribed to chemical influences. Espe
cially the reference was made to several
old pain tings by Ruysdael and others, of>
which It was formerly thought that the
artist had purposely used the red brown
to bring out the figures in the foreground,
while really.it was only a discoloration of
green paint. - : . . '

is a large canvas, an Irish scene, entitled
"Nine Miles from Cork." The subject is
quaint; one of the old-fashioned jaunting

After luncheon, which was served at I,
the carriage was ordered, and generally
both would go for a drive. Many visitors
came to the house to see the President.
Every alternoon when official duties re
laxed, up to the blue room would come
the major, as she called him, armed with
a load of daily papers, most of them
marked copies. There he would pull up
the great chair and read through column
after column, generally much amused,
though always humoring her wish, that
ne read ell the articles about himself.
Sometimes he would relate" humorous in
cidents of the day and his hearty laugh
brought many a smile to the sweet face
which he always watched with such ten
der Interest. Never In my experience as
nurse have I seen devotion like that the
late President gave to his wife.
But In the Canton home he waa even
more the husband and less the man of
Â«.ffa.1m, for In the old place, which we
reached on the 6th of July, he dropped
Xor a time the worries and cares of state
life and gave himself up to utter happi
ness; and his happiness was contagious;
everybody seemed to feel it. and be happy
In sympathy. The chief* characteristic of
the old Ohio home was simplicity and
system. Every morning at 8 o'clock the
President, Mrs. McKinley, Secretary Cor
telyou and Dr. Rixey would assemble for
breakfast, after which the President
would read for an hour, sometimes from
the little book called Dally Needs, some
times a chapter from the Bible. Then af
ter a smoke and a look at the stable, a
ramble through the garden or a short,
brisk walk, he would return and shave
himself. This shaving was as important
a part of the morning as was the break
fast and was always amusing, for often
when a friend would call, possibly an old
acquaintance, like Senator Hanna, for In
stance, he would cry out: "Come In here,
I am shaving, but we can chat all the
earae." Then out in the hall with a big
towel pinned around his neck, soap on
his face, and perhaps a razor In his hand,
he would rush to meet his friend. Some
times catching a glimpse of himself In the
hall mirror, he would burst into hearty
laughter and go back to his room. ! Al
ways in the morning the President would
sing, his voice deep and clear, generally
a hymn, but sometimes a popular melody
or some pretty little nursery rhyme, like
â¢'Rock a-bye. Baby," and on the piano he
would drum out an accompaniment with
one linger. During those hours of soag
and good burner Mrs. McKinley would
smile and listen, and her dainty hands
made the needle fly in her beloved knit
ting, or the would bend over eome flimsy
lace, the mending of which she would not
trust to her maid.
The room occupied by Mrs. McKinley
at the White House was all in dainty
blue; blue velvet carpet, blue walls, ceil
ing and blue hangings; the furniture was
In antique oak, very massive and very
grand. One of the most treasured pic
"tures in my memory is that of the Presi
dent and Mrs. McKinley in this room.
After she had regained her strength and
was able to be about, she v/ould have a
great arm chair rolled up by the window
and there would sit In some soft cling
ing white gown, with a flimsy shawl
thrown over her shoulders, making a pic
ture against the light, as she bent her
head listening Intently to the smooth
round tones of the President's voice as
h.e read aloud to her.
The first few weeks after we reached
Washington I was closely confined by
Mrs. McKinley's almost fatal relapse, but
after that I enjoyed many hours of lib-"
erty, and during those hours, when off
duty, I was shown about the city with
the consideration and kindness that would
be accorded an honored guest instead of
a trained nurse.
Upon our arrival at the White House,
the one thing that impressed me most
was the wonderful welcome, the almost
reverent expression beaming on the face
of every old servant In the place, and
how each and every one was rewarded
by a kind word, a hand clasp and a
cheery smile from the head of the nation.
He was a man who thought little things
worth while.
Of the journey from this city to Wash
ington I have oniy the pleasantest mem
cries. All the people with whom I came
in contact were the kindest imaginable,
each cne showing the utmost considera
tion. Through the characteristic thought
fulness and the kindly spirit of the Presi
dent, my duties were made during the
trip as light as possible, he himself upon
several occasions relieving me at- the bed-
Bide of the invalid. On one occasion while
passing along the Ohio Ri% r er, where the
scenery is particularly fine, he came into
â¢he sick apartment and said: "Miss Hunt,
Â¦we are passing through a very nice part
of the country, and I am sure you would
enjoy it. I have been over this road be
fore ana am familiar with it, so you go
out and get a breath of fresh air and I
will look after the madam," -which he did
for the period of an hour or more.
So much can be crowded Into so limited
a time, an entire life can be lived In a
year. Of course It was all a great sur
prise and I was more than pleased when
they told me that I was to accompany
the Presidential party to Washington. I
felt then that for all my long hard years
cf study and hospital work the reward
had come, and I was so thankful that I
had sacrificed a few pleasures to study,
and that that study had enabled me to
meet the opportunity when It came.
From the very flret my experience has
been like a dream, a dream full of sad
ness, yet a sadness that I would not for
get, for through Its medium I have been
taught how beautiful, how sublime It Is
possible for a human life to be, and how
peaceful and grand Its ending. Never
have the precepts and the doctrines of
true Christianity been more forcibly ex
emplified than in the dally life of our late
President, with whom, until his passing,
I had the privilege and honor of dally
association since my departure from this
city Just seven months ago.
I have had a Ion* and varied
I experience since I last saw Cali
| I forala. In this world of ours one
{ never can tell what fate has In
X store for us. Little did I think
Â¦when the telegram came to Lane Hospital
from Dr. Hlrscafelder last May with a
request that I attend the sick room In the
Bcott residence here where Mrs. McKin
ley lay suffering that in a few month*
I would stand by the death bed of the
noble man, the devoted husband, he to
whom all the city was paying homage as
the President of the United States.
The Us* Days
cF ths Martyi^d
On the evening before the fatal end he
seemed to know that he was near death,
and he asked to see his wife. When she
came into the room, once, and that once
only, did the brave little woman show
her grief. As she knelt by the bedsida
and grasped his hands in hers she seemed
to feel that he was slipping away from
her, and when he murmured words of
consolation she buried her face In the cov
ers and sobbed aloud, realizing only too
Keenly her o-wn great sorrow.
Then came the end, that plunged the
entire world into sadness. I hope never
aeain to see ' strong men weep as they
wept when the report that the President
was dying was taken to those anxiously
Â¦waiting in the corridor. Secretaries Root.
Hitchcock and Wilson and many .others
came for a moment to the chamber and
spoke with us, then, with tears streaming
down their cheeks, they ladly made their
way down the stairs. At the last I waa

last period of consciousness, and, with
many others, during the chanting of ths
favored hymn "Nearer. My God, to Thee."
turned away that our sobs might not dis
turb the utter peacetulnesa and sublim
ity of one so happy in the face of death.
There were some twenty relatives and
friends In the chamber at the very lasf,
but when Dr. Rlxey gave token that a
beautiful soul had fled never to return
not a sound was heardâ all was hushod
and solemn. After the sorrowing watch
ers had turned away one remainedâ thÂ«
life-long friend. Senator Hanna, He broke
down and sobbed like a child.

- The funeral I did not attend, for after
the President's death I was always -with
Mrs. McKinley. returning with her to the
Canton home, where I had been the wit
ness of so much happiness.
In Canton there were throngs of peo
ple, so silent and so reverent. They all
looked as if they had lost a personal
friend: and to see Mrs. McKinley In the
old home alone made ray heart ache. She
looked so frail, so dependent, that I felt,
though my own health was breaking: un
der the continued strain, I would remain
with her and do my best for his sake and
After a few days had passed Mrs. Bar
ber came to stay with her, and then the
bereaved wife called for the papere and
had her niece read aloud all about the
nation's loss and her own. Until the ISth
of October I remained in the Canton
home; then, feeling that I must "rest, I
went to New York, and now at last have
returned to my native State.
Some time after my departure I re
ceived . a telegram from Mrs. McKinley
asking me' to return, but owing to my
physical need of change and rest I was
obliged to reply, "Willing but Impossible."
EVA HUNT, Â¦>
I never" went to his bedside that he did
not inquire for her and sigh, "Poor little
weman. what will she doT' He knew
only too well that his going would mean
her entire loneliness. Sometimes he
Â¦would express a -wish to see some of his
old friends, but owing to his weakness
only his right arm." as it were, the Secre
tary of War, and Mrs. McKinley were al
lowed to run the gauntlet of doctors.
Upon the President being brought to the
Milburn house everything _ waa hushed
and Quiet. A detail of Infantry was or
dered to the place from Fort Porter. To
keep away the anxious crowd that surged
back and forth on the streets near the
house a temporary picket line was estab
lished. In the house all waa Impressively
silent; velvet shod doctors congregated in
the consultation room, white robed nurses
slipped softly about, two in attendance
all of the timeâ that la, one nurse and
ono orderly. There were three nurses-
Miss Maud Mohan, Miss Jane Conway
and myselfâ alternating in watches of six
hours each. I went on duty at 4 in the
morning, and was by the bedside or in
the room when the first streaks of early
dawn and later little glimpses of sun
would shine through the window. Often
the President would ask that the curtains
be opened, that he might see the sun
shining through the trees. "They are so
very beautiful," ho would say. Always
his thoughts were not of his own suffer
ing nor of himself, but of the frail little
woman, the partner of his joys and sor
rows, whom he felt from the first would
soon be alone.
Never Will I forget the consternation In
the Milburn house when the reports of
the cowardly attack were brought in.
The thought of possible death struck awe
to every heart. Mrs. McKinley was rest-
Ink in her room at the time and, of course,
the news was kept from her. Every few
moments she would say: "Eva, is it not
time for the major to return? I had bet
ter dress for dinner." and I, knowing all
the timo what fatal news awaited her.
would make an evasive reply, so not until
she was told by Dr. Kixey did she sus
pect anything.
Poor little woman, she was very brave
through it all.
Soon the fatal decision was reached to
attend the exposition at Buffalo, and to
this, strange to say. Mrs. McKInley al
ways objected, although she gave no rea
son for not wishing to go. However, her
objections were laughed aside. The story
of the terrible ass.-issination which took
place at the Temple of Music in Buffalo
Is already well known.
At half past 9 another chapter from the
Bible would be read and at 10 precisely
the lights were all turned out. Not until
Mrs. McKinley had retired to her room
were any affairs of state attended to.
Generally this would keep the President
and the secretary until midnight; then,
never will I forget how it Impressed me,
for I slept in a room adjacent to Mrs.
McKinley and could not but hear, he
would kneel down and pray aloudâ touch-
Ing, fervent appeals to the Creatorâ that
he might be guided to do the best for
the nation's good and that all would be
well Jor the salvation of mankind. Often
when I listened to these midnight prayers
I would think there is one man that can
not fear death, for if there is such a place
as heaven he cannot fall to go there.
The evenings spent In the President's
house were very beautiful. After dinner
the lights in the sitting-room were turned
up. and here the President and Mrs. Mc-
Kinley would play cribbage, a game In
â¢which ho always allowed his partner to
â¢win, -while he laughed heartily at his own
loss. Sometimes Secretary Cortelyou. who
Is an expert musician, would entertain

MY EXPERIENCES AS A NURSE

you know who they are? Or.
in knowing who they are,

series on just those lines.

In the big, spreading library that occu
pies the sunny Van Ness avenue'eorner of
her home, where the bay window reaches
out to catch all the California sunshine
that Is abroad to be caught, there are
rows of bookshelves, that suggest the
most luxurious hours in deep-cushioned
chairs, easy and graceful rattan chairs,
that would tempt anybody, even a Pil
grim father. >^ 4 '_. .'â¢. ' \ '
This home is stamped with the stamp of
Mrs. Merrill's individuality. It is the homa
of wealth, but the wealth,is not what at
tracts ycur attention first of all. You
think of the taste, the love of warmth, of
comfort, of books, . of beauty, You are
not oppressed with a djsplay, of elegance,
There Is nothing formal and cheerless in
the air. \The very Japanese who lets you

his lookâ he has not -been trained to the

PERHAPS Mrs. Merrill is the most
versatile club woman in this city.
It saves a writer a great deal of
future trouble to put in that "per
haps." Otherwise there would be
people and people's friends cropping up
to contradict a statement. Making no
statement is delightfully safe. However,
it would be interesting to see a more ver
satile one pointed out.
When women take to clubbing they al
most always drop society in a professional
sense. They keep on being sociable; they
have friends, whom they see informally;
but they are nit longer counted "society
women." Mrs. Merrill, though, is.
She is at least four things thoroughly
and professionally. She is, first of all, a
homemaker: second, she Is a philan
thropist; third, she Is a society woman;
fourth, she is a club woman. Now, whom
do you know that keeps up as many sides
of life? --"^;
Her club fame Is recent, but she has
taken to the work so earnestly and en
thusiastically that she has achieved that
very high round of the local ladder, name
ly, the presidency of the Century Club.
Now, the Century Club is old and con
servative, and. although it will scorn the
colloquial epithet, it is swell. It Is very
literary, very exclusive and, coming down
to hard fact, it is very expensive.
Mrs. Merrill has been a member of the
Century Club for a long time, but her
presidency is less than a year qld. She
was too busy with charitable work for
some years to devote much time to self
<-ulture. Other people needed her. The
Red Cross demanded her time. But the
war is quiet now and she has a chance to
rest â that is. If you can call it resting to
be president of a big city club." t s. '
The Century Club is literary in the
broad sense of the word, and Mrs. Mer
rill has tastes that correspond. She loves

Within the colors are warm, the cush
ions deep and and flowers are
plenty. These are one of Mrs. Merrill's
fads. She has masses of huckleberry . In
big jardinieres, palms and ferns g"rowln.R
in the hall, fresh mignonette making tha
air sweet. There are those little touches
about the home 'which canr.ot be the
work- of servants or a hired housekeeper.
They are of the eternal feminine, of the
home-loving woman.
She has another fad besides plants: it'
is cocker spaniels. She has two of them,
as dear to her as members of the family,
and they are never forgotten even in tha
midst of their mistress' arduous life. Tn
the morning she steals a little time for
a walk with them â she laughs afherself
for doing it, but says that it gives her
the fresh air and exercise that she needs
to keep up her health, and at the same
time she enjoys ' the dogs. They are
bumptiously affectionate and demand a
great deal more , of her time than they
can have."
Mrs. Merrill first brought herself before
the public by her. philanthropic work. In
1898 she made herself famous more than
locally by her Red Cross labors. She was
elected ' president of the San Francisco
Red Cross and the work that the organ
ization did under her leadership was im
mense. Statistics showed that during
one year the society had enabled, 6000
United States soldiers "to reach their
homes, had relieved 787 and found em
ployment for 340. This goes to show that
Mrs. . Merrill is not a philanthropic
dreamer.
In fact, she has a good deal more keen,
hard, business common sense than most
men have. She is -the kind of woman
who can put her schemes into -practical
execution.
Â» The Children's Hospital has always
been very close to her heart. When her
oldest son, Henry, died she and her hus
band endowed a bed in his nameâ a bed
where some â¢ little sufferer could always
be as comfortable as hi3 suffering would
let him be, and where he could have all
the care that modern science and eternal
human kindness could give. \ The bed is
lor surgical cases and it is entirely free.
The gift of endowment was $5000, for- it
takes a large sum of money to keep, up
such # a charity. . '. :Â¦-.
Mrs. Merrill has shown plainly enough
that her interest in % this charity, was
prompted by j real sympathy and not a
love of display. She keeps close watch
of. that particular- bed, goes to see its
little occupant and takes ' the keenest in
terest \ in his progress. Besides , this, ' she
gives a great deal of time to the work
of the hospital asa whole, and her purse
has'the loosest, kind of strings.
If you ask her where she finds the time
to look after so many affairs. she will tell
you that ; she ' does not know. It seems
sometimes as If she would . be obliged ; to
Bit up nights to look after them alL And
she | adds, that if , a good fairy j should
come along ' her first wish would be
"forty-eight hours to every day, if you
please,'' .
to hold the breath without effort for
forty-f;ve seconds.
Rapid and shallow breathing is strictly
unhygienic. It leaves a large portion of
the lungs entirely unused, and part of
hands at ail in this position, or even make
the elbows meet without assistance? â¢ ;
IMPORTANT DETAILS.
In walking the foot must never be so
placed as to allow it to rest . upon the
breathing incident to the vocal training of
singers and elocutionists.
The first thing to acquire is breath con
trol. Learn to manage what you have,
then Increase your supply. This is ac
complished by building up power to hold
one's breath. Inhale slowly and smpotlHy
as much air as possible, swelling out the
lower chest at the s'.des ji!3t below the
armpits as air is drawn in. Hold this air
flvo. seconds, measuring the time with
footsteps; then exhale it all slowly and
gradually, continuing to breathe out until
you feel empty. During the exhalation
keep the upper chest still; don't let it
sink. Inhale again and hold the breath
/or ten seconds." Exhale fully; inhale
again and hold for twenty seconds. This
is lonjj enough for the first trial. With
ten minutes a day piflcticc. within affew
weeks or a month power may be gained
last thing she would dare attempt If un- '
trained in the art."
To mount stairs properly there should
be no waddling from side to side â none
whatever; no trudging, as though the ob
ject were to push holes in the steps, no
leaning forward and no apparent Â¦weari
ness. The body should remain erect, the
step should bo taken from the toe, and
the movement to the next step made with
a springing motion, a caress of the struc
ture. If j'ou will, instead of a kick.' This
produces a gradual; graceful, poetic ele
vation, instead of a cumbersome hauling
of the body upv/ard.
HYGIENIC BREATHING.
To increase; the pleasure of walking and
lessen the exertion we must know how to
breathe properly, because if the lungs are
v/ell inflated an added" buoyancy is im
parted to the body. I>fot one person In
ten breathes correctly, and not one woman
in a hundred breathes ' ribrmally, the
respiration varying with every change of
Ynental state or physical condition; srief,
depression, fatigue, all have their influ
ences in lowering the amount of oxygen
that goes into the system, and it is a rare
thing for a woman to use her lungs to tho
best possible advantage, unless she has
the de.finite and special instruction in
started along tue long supports directly
to the spine and head. Another thingâ
and this is for the short-legged woman to
remember â the length of the step should
be proportioned to the length of the leg.
Walk erectly. This does not mean with
eyes fixed on the stars, neither does it
mean a grait that is a constant beginning
to fall, which does not become a fall only
because the other foot and leg get in the
way and prevent it. A good rule is to
â¢Â¦press up v.-ith the head as though a
weight were being carried there." If one
thus stands or walks very little attention
is needed to keep the eyes up. as well as
back and shoulders. This effort to stand
erect assists in giving the right emphasis
to the ball of the foot, to which we have
already referred.
Stair climbing as a means to grace of
locomotion Is perhaps a novel idea, but
the woman who has mastered the art of
going up stairs in truly scientific fashion
is the one who. as to her gait, may be
likened to a Diana following the hounds.
So enthusisatic is one devotee of this
theory that she says:
"Place me with my rival In the presence
of a man in whom we are both interested.
and the first thing I should do would be
to walk up stairs. This would be the very

one case out of ten, when the whole phy
sical instrument is naturally in-turie, and
harmony or grace results. In the ether
nine cases o"e portion of the body Is
keyed too high or too low^ producing phy
sical discord, which we call awkwardness.'
Walking, correct and graceful walking,
must as a rule, be acquired like any other
accomplishment, by study. English wo
men of the nobility are carefully trained
in this respect in order that they may
possess a fine carriage when presented at
oourt. Â«
It is a matter of tradition that Queen
Victoria owed her regal carriage to a
drill sergeant who. after making endless
respectful suggestions, with no effect
upon his pupil, horrified her governess
and astonished her by saying sharply:
"A pretty Queen you'll make with that
dot-aniii-go-one gait."
Up went the little chin, back went the
shoulders, down went the elbows, and in
her wrath the little Princess did precisely
what the old soldier had been striving to
make her do; but his delighted cry of
"just right!" was another surprise to her,
inasmuch as she had been conscious of
no muscular effort whatever. From that
time forth incessit reeina.
When one rises to walk the whole body
should be thrown into a state of general
tension, which brings al! the muscles Into
vigorous action, and so perfectly balanced
that every part does its work without
perceptible strain. In this balanced posi
tion the hips, chin, chest and toes come
into a line; the shoulder, hip and ankle
joint are also upon a line; In this position
the body acquires the greatest ease.
Take a free and firm but light stride,
balancing the upper part of the body alter
nately upon each hip, but without sway-
Ing it perceptibly, and giving the impetus
forward with a slight spring from the ball
of the foot; this gives a spring}' and elas
tic step. When the emphasis, so to speak,
is on the heel, the fatigue of walking is in
creased tenfold, because a jar is thus
the air in them unchanged. Deep breath-
Ing strengthens and increases the muscles
of the chest and the abdomen. The ab
dominal muscle directly overlies the in
testines, and Its motioÂ« stimulates the
whole digestive apparatus, thus contrib
uting to its healthful activity. To the
woman burdened' with too much flesh,
deep breathing is absolutely essential as
one of the best cures for obesity, as the
increased amount of oxygen greatly aug
ments the consumption of waste material.
It must be pure air and sunshine, how
ever, that are breathed in to have the de
sired effect.
In shallow breathing the blood does net
get all the oxygen it needs In order to
burn up the waste matters in the body.
To ascertain the capacity of the lungs,
find out how often you draw a full breath.
Can you, when standing with the arms
and hands extended before you and tak
ing a full Inspiration, touch the knuckles
behind the back without the tendency, to
cough? Can you touch the backs of the
outer edge. It must not be allowed,
either, to rest upon the inner edge, but
In each . and every position it must be
firmly planted on the ground. People
who walk on the outer edge of the foot
appear more or less apelike; those who
walk on the inner edge look as though
they were splay-footed. The toes should
not be excessively turned out. The whole
movement should be elastic, avoiding, on
the one hand, the appearance of stiff
ness and on the other that of springs in
the knees, which should not be bent in
walking.
Carry yourself in walking so that a ,
plumb line dropped from your nose would
fall just an inch In front of your great
toe is the advice of one who speak3 ex
cathedra, with this added: Don't thrust
your head forward, don't bend your knees
In walking, and remember that high
heeled and narrow-toed shoes are the In
flexible enemies of grace.
The walk of all walks to avoid is the
"golf walk," a loose-jointed stride,
flapping arms, a "poked" head and
neck, and a queer, flat-chested car
riage being its leading characteristics.
Some women have the habit of Jerking
the head forward at each step, like a
hen, a performance which is most un
graceful. Bunching up the shoulders and
swinging both arms rapidly backward
and forward, like a ship which has broken
loose from her moorings, are also to be
avoided. Another peculiarity is that of
jerking the shoulders alternately at each
step, as If propelling the body forward-.
Men have been known to lose their
hearts all on account of a~ graceful,
fetching walk. An Englishman who was
so attracted by the superb carriage and
gait of an American girl as he walked
from church behind her never rested un
til he had been introduced, with the S3
'juel that they were married and lived
aapplly ever afterward: Let this be a
word to the wise.
A. person, of course, cannot always be
conscious of his breathing, but with care
he can train himself to the habit of
breathing deeply and properly. The sense
cf well being that this practice gives is
ample re-ward for the slight labor in
volved. Above all, let it be remembered
that the nose, not the mouth, is tho
breathing apparatus. Breathe in as much
punshine as possible; this, with pure oxy
gen, is a remedy for all the ills to which
flesh Is heir.

place and then run a stitching along each
edge. It will be found to be very effective.
' A' Spider ;Web. '.-.*.
A new skirt trimming appeared upon the
gown worn by Mrs. Leslie Carter off the
stage. The gown was, In black, a black
Ottoman silk of coarse weave. The skirt
was cut plain and sheath shaped and the
waist . was I slightly bloused in front.
The novelty lay in the trimming, which
consisted of narrow bands of black velvet
ribbon. These were arranged at the side
exactly like a spider web. The ribbons
came out from a central place, diverging
like the typical pictorial web, and there
were narrower ribbons crossing it to make
an intricate mesh. The velvet had small
jetted beads here and there, but only
enough to make the ribbon 1 sparkle.
The web was large enough to nearly
cover one side of. the skirt and was all in
black, without a particle of color near it.
A smaller web decorated the front The
"bodice had one directly upon the middle
'of the front, of large size. This Is a kind
of trimming that. could be easily applied
- at home and would decorate any gown,
black or white, bright or dulL It might
bust.
This makes a very pretty form of vari
ation with any gown.
. Attention to detail 1b a matter that can-
OF the small things of dress one
must sing at this time.
With Lent approaching, when
one dances no more for forty days
and nights, and with Easter in the
air. one's thoughts turn, perforce, to the
powns of the street and to the small
things that make or break these costumes.
Street gowns are distinctively the gowns
of Lent, for then one attends sewing cir
cles, musicales and readings; the society
woman or the woman of social instincts
ieeps on the go. Many of the entertain
ments that come into existence later on
are conceived during Lent, and a large
percentage of the numerous and popular
society affairs are thought out during the
days when society itself is supposed to be
abstaining from Indulgences.
To look always well is dependable upon
the email things of gowning. One can
defy a woman to buy a gown, no matter
how elegant, and to wear It constantly
without any surety of approval. It will
tire the eye, pall upon the sight, in style
as well as in color, grow tame and same
and be uninteresting. No matter how ele
gant the gown, this same criticism can be
made. It must be varied to continue to
interest-
Varying the Gown.
This item of varying one's gown is the
most important one a woman can grasp.
In matters of household Interest, such as
in the setting of the table, this quality
would not be questionc-d for a momentâ
the importance of variety. But in the
matter of the dress menu it is not always
so quickly understood.
The best dressers In the world, those
who hold and maintain a reputation for
dressing well, continually, month after
month, all through the year, are those
who manage always to wear something
novel â not necessarily new, but rearranged
tastefully, so as to seem new.
Striking articles are by no means the
best for this. There are many reasons
why the garment known as ".-Vriking" Is
not to be advised besides the fact that It
Js not In good taste. One of the main rea
sons is that it is too distinctive, too eas
ily recognized, too much in character, as
it were, and not sufBciently nondescript
to be worn many times.
A bofiice of eea green, for example. Is
never good unless one owns many bodices
end can bring out the sea green only once
in a while, and always to a different audi
ence. On the other hand, a bodice of
black, suppose the new black moire, per
haps cut in the Gibson fashion, with
broad plaits to widen the shoulders, could
be worn a hundred times and trimmed
with green, if green were desired. There
are adjustable green yokes, cuffs that can
be slipped on, papels of green that enliven
the front and standing collar of. green:-
These and many other things could be
added to make the bodice perennially new.
To secure an amount of catchlness in
dress, to look always well and attrac
tively gowned, a woman should pay at
tention to three laws:
First, neatness in dress.
Second, variety in dress.
Third, attention to detail.
Neatness in Dress.
The first of these Is the most difficult
and one of the most expensive. Neatness
in the twentieth century. 1902, sense does
not mean mere brushing and binding; it
pertains to the characteristics of the
sown.
The Immaculate band upon the collar,
changed once or twice a day, the marvel
ously neat sleeve cuffs and ruchings, be
they bell, turnover or wristbands, the fln
ishings of the gownâ these distinguish the
costume as neat.
Variety In dress Is something not all
can accomplish, but all can come very
near to it. Ingenuity will take the place
of quantity and color schemes will make
an old gown seem like new.
It is to be a black and white season,
and for this the woman of not many
gowns will rejoice. With black one can
do so much and all on such a limited
amount, compared to that which one can
do with other colors. A black gown
dressed out to-day with a side panel of
gold lacings, arranged upon a back
ground of corn colored taffeta, looks well;
and if the bodice be also In corn color or
the yellows, or in white, It makes a full
suit. To-morrow the same go wit might
be trimmed with a hip yoke of tan-col
ored lace, with the yoke arranged so that
it comes up on the bodice nearly to the
Tb.8 Question of drop skirts and linings
The Drop Skirts.
A handsome style of gown'for the street
will be made of veiling of rather heavy
weight, yet so that its lining shows
through in a shaded fashion: This comes
in all the colors and can be recommended
in the paler shades. It makes an excel
lent suit and In violet Is particularly pret
ty. A violet veiling, made ove* pink, done
In tailored fashion and trimmed with wide
satin ribbon stitched fiat to the goods
upon each edge, will form the basis of a
handsome suit for a well-dressed woman.
For a dressy suit, say for an Easter suit,
the satin cloth is good and comes as low
or as high as one cares to go. There are
broadcloths of light weight and cash
meres as good as broadcloth, though not
as heavy; also ladies' cloths and goods
that are called satin-faced goods. From
these one can select.
The Scotch plaids, the homespuns, the
Irish tweeds and English suitings are all
beginning to appear and, In color, in pat
tern and in attractive surfaces, they were
never equaled.
In the purples and blues and all the
shales of heliotrope there are new goods
that have no woolly surface but are more
in the nature of tweed. There is a coarse
outside which Is very attractive from the
standpoint of wear and at sight one can
understand that it will not attract dust,
but will shake out well. '
While selecting a spring suit it Is well
to remember that, in spite of all fashion
able predictions, purple, heliotrope, violet
and mauve come in with each March., Not
more regularly do the March winds blow
than these colors appear. Purple was once
practically the only color of spring, just
as brown is the color of fall, and it Is still
the oncthat is most wornâ purple and its
close relative, blue.
Automobile red and black will be worn
so much together that one is safe in buy
ing and in making up a spring gown in
these shades.
The Spring Colors.
But for the gown that is to he worn
steadily during the next two months it is
well to think a little before going into the
fuyzy goods. There is a camel's hair which
looks very hairy upon the surface without
being too shaggy, the hairs being woven
In. This sort of camel's hair resembles
the popular Oxford and has something of
a glossy surface. It Is not expensive and
makes up well for very early spring. If
purchased in a medium blue, with black
hairs, it Is well to trim it with et'tched
bands of black cloth arranged to form a
pattern. If one buys a brown, then let
black or brown or deep red be the trim
ming.
Zibeline purchased now at reduced rates
will come in good in the fall and nothing
can exceed the satisfaction which a wom
an feels at being able to bring out some
thing in October which costs nothing yet
is fashionable, well made and as stylish as
everâ having been bought late, made up
modishly and which received little wear
and tear.
Zibeline still holds its own, but in pur
chasing a new gown, one that can be
worn into Easter days, it is better to get
something that will look more springlike.
A year ago the fancy was all for the
tatin cloth, and when summer deepened
Into fall these disappeared or were rele
gated to the calling set, while the ha'ry
goods came forth, and zibeline was the
material of the year.'
But it is toward the new fabrics that
the mind turns at this time. If there is
a new gown to be purchased the selection
of the goods becomes of great importance.
The New Fabrics.
A jeweled chou worn by Mrs. Henry
Clews Jr., who was once Mrs. Frederick
Gebhard, was in corn color, with a center
of topaz.
A sort of ribbon harness is arranged for
the chou eet. It begins with the bow- at
the back of the neck and is continued to
the chou upon the bust. From there the
ends hang to the waist and are sometimes
twisted around it to. make a be'.t. and
finally are tied in front or at the side.
The chou, from being a mere trifle of
adornment, has now become something
handsome. It is made into saucer size,
and In the center there rests a rose. From
the middle of the chou, coming from un
der the rose, there hang two ribbon ends,
and these are tied into a bow. which is
fastened to the side of the belt.
It Is an easy matter to put $800 into
trifles these days, and from the waist up
ward it can be done. Beginning with the
gold link purse which hangs at one eide
the Blze of a dinner plate, to the neck,
where dangles a. gold chain with its pearls
and its little jeweled tablets, there are
great possibilities.
The society woman who solemnly as-
Eerted at a ladies' luncheon, in confidence
over the teacups, that she had on a gown
that cost $75, while the small things of
dress â not her underclothing, but the vis
ible articles â cost $800, was no extrava
gant exception to the rule. The class of
women who dress in this manner is a
large c^ne and includes not only the magic
chain of the women of the 400, but many
more.
Cost of Small Things.
not be overestimated, and under this
heading comes a consideration of the
small articles that, while they go to make
up a woman's wardrobe, are often of so
expensive a brand that the woman who
invests must have a heavy purse upon
which to draw.
The union of satin and silk may be
classed among the novelties. Seen to
gether the two make quite an odd trim
ming, one that Is not at first recognized
There come satin ribbons with a band of
eilk at each side, and silk ribbon with a
strip of satin running: down the middle
But If used freely, ribbon is expensive and
those who must look to the littles prefer
to buy a yard of satin and a yard of silk
and experiment.
For the satin there should be as high
a gloss as possible and for the silk there
should be as little as possible. A high
grade satin atrip, with a border of peau
The lift of spring, done by hand, will be
the back lift. There is no other way of
keeping the skirt off the street. The. hand
grasps as much of the material as pos
sible fight in the middle of the back, and
as low down as may beâ and lifts. There
is no other way that Is practicable. The
very close sheath skirt .will not admit of

There are several varieties of fob and of
course, they come in various stages of ele
gance. Some are Jeweled and some not
some gold and some silver, some round
and some square,' and In the selection a
woman shows her taste and her extrava
gance.
Lifting the Skirt.
Yet there are other methods of lifting
the skirt. One of these is by the fob. This
is an attachment of ribbon hanging at
one side of the belt. On the end of the
ribbon is a hook which catches the skirt
The latter can be raised to any height, or
correspondingly lowered! .
Since the long skirt is In, and is to stay
in, there are various devices for lifting it.
The most popular and most graceful is
the lift that is accomplished by a. wom
an's own hand, and the habit of lifting
the skirt, once formed, becomes a second
nature. At first it tires, but when a wom
an learns the fashionable lift and culti
vates- it she soon becomes accustomed to
it.' ,
An English box coat looks Â»well upon
sweet sixteen, and the coat that hangs
straight in front with buttons under the
flap is the best, because of the style at
tached to its plainness. There is a smart
ness about the plain coat which must bÂ«
studied to be understood. Around the hem
there can be row after row of stitching,
which is the way the English coat of
spring will be finished. ' -'
The- tucked hips,, released below, while
good for sweet sixteen, are suitable for
children of 8 or 10 years, and are more be
coming than the kilted skirt, while pre
serving many of its properties.
In making a dress for sweet sixteen re
member that It is her desire to appear,
not youthful, but mature. She will not
fancy the gown buttoned in the back, nor
will she like the waist with its baby yoke
and gulmpes. Her taste will be for the
waist with long lines," and, indeed, sho
looks more shapely In- such a one.
The waist Is a very simple thing in gray
flannel, exactly the color of the skirt.
There are tucks of taffeta laid upon It so
as to make a panel down each side of the
front. The buttons are small, clear white
ones, sewed on with a shank and adding
much to the waist trimming. The back is
plain and snug.
For Sweet Sixteen.
The plaits are stitched flat to a point
about even with the knees and then re
leased,' to make a flare. Thus the skirt is
full around the foot. A deep hem com
pletes It. and there are two rows of stitch
ing at the top of the hem.
The skirt is placed upon a band that
neatly fits the waist. At the belt the
skirt is laid in side plaits of three inches
each. There are two plaits at each side.
The front hangs plain in an unbroken
panel, and the back is laid in a double
box plait, just so as to give room for a
pocket hole and to cover the same.
A suit planned for sweet sixteen, one
that might be worn calling, or walking,
or to school, is the work of a professional
dress designer. Its elegance depends upon
the fabric from v.hich it is built. If in
tweed it would make a good school dress:
if in corduroy, an outing frock; if in satin
cloth, a. calling gown.-for such calls as the
sixteen-year-old girl makes.
There is an establishment upon a fash
ionable street in New York that now em
ploys designers to originate dresses fnr
girls of 14 and 16. These must bÂ» : stylish,
neat, becoming and not too expensive. The
horrors of the days when the girl fully
grown, but not yet developed, was com
pelled to V^ar a round skirt and a round
wai3t, diversified, perhaps, by a tuck or
two, have passed away.
i Gowns for schoolgirls are taking an im
portant place in the world's fashions.
Those who design dresses have not forgot
ten that the growing girl exists and. are
now awakening to a realizing sense of the
fitness of making the girl's garments as
they should be made. . \ '.
For Schoolgirls.
An Easter bride is to have not one but
four moire waists. One Is broad upon the
shoulders, having a wide plait laid at each
side to make the shoulders appear wider.
It is in shell pink. It is double breasted
and buttons with small silver buttons. A
black moire waist buttons with black silk
buttons, placed a little on one side, while
waists respectively in blue and in white
are- buttoned with white enamel and with
pale pink, buttons, each button of tiny
size and surrounded ly a gold setting.
A moire waist, made up smartly, and
embellished with Russian cuffs, an up-to
date stock and trimmed with a bright
chou upon the bust, is one of the most at
tractive of waists.
A new material for waists is coming in,
or a very old material made new. This is
moire, that old-time silk which was worn
by the traditional grandmother for. her
Sunday best, and which always appeared
upon mourning occasions.
Is pretty well settled for the Easter, sea
son. There will be drop skirts whether
there are linings or not. Silk drop Bklrts,
to be put on like a petticoat, come with
all the nice suits and those that are not
supplied with them can have them quick
ly made. A very thin,' very close-fitting
taffeta' petticoat, all of onÂ« color, and
trimmed, not with lace but with a taffeta
flounce, makes a delightful drop skirt, one
that can be renewed often and will not
wear out.

Though his bark cannot be lost.
Yet it shall be tempest tossed.
And of a truth her bark is "tempest
tossed," and has always been, but it will
prove strong enough for her as long as
she will have need of It.
When she was a girl her home was in
bleak Massachusetts. Hearing only the
best and sunniest things of California.
she and her husband made the trip out
here and left all that was dear to them.
One thing after another went wrong, un
til her husband tried to forget all his
sorrows In drink. In forgetting them, ho
also forgot his wife and baby.
Then the energetic little lady showed
what she was made of. The lighthouse
position came their way and she grasped
at It as a drowning person would at a
straw. And all these years it has proved
her salvation. V
Every night excepting three weeks she
has dragged herself up those winding
stairs. When sickness, sorrow or dis
tress presented itself she pushed It aside
and went blindly on. While she tolled
nightly to win the daily bread, her hus
band traveled dally to spend it.
Then came a time when she found her
self all alone. The children married and
her husband died. But desert the, light
house? Never. Or, at least, not as Ion*
as she could reach the lamp.
"Don't you think It Is about time for
the Government to pension your* X asked.
"Indeed, no. Why on earth should thÂ«
Government pension me? It has paid
me well all these years and there cer
tainly no obligation on its side that
I can see. Why, I am plenty strong
enough to earn my own living for many
a day to come. Don't look like it? And
now, young lady. I'll tell you a secret. Z y
do not know what medicine Is. I have
been too busy all my life long to make
its acquaintance, and, really, I am not
sorry, for now I am healthy and I prob
ably should not have been."
No nervous prostration for her. No
change of climate to the dry mountain
air. Plenty of work and fresh air aro
what she advocates. I wonder If more
people tried her remedy how the doctors
would fare? I rather fancy their families
would not visit Europe in such flocks.
"See all the steps I have to keep clean.
That takes up several hours every day.
And I do not sweep them either. Each
and every one has to be wiped with a
cloth to keep the dust from going near
the lamp."
'. Steps, steps, steps. I tried my mother's
favorite scheme of running my finger
along the articles dusted. It never failed
with her, and I fancied It wouldn't fail
with me. But it did. Try as hard as I
could, no dust rewarded my labor. Every
thing in that nouse was Immaculate.
"Will you pardon me If I go and see
about my dinner? The men who arÂ»
tending to my barley eat here, as it takes
too long to go home. I will not be away
long. Will you amuse yourself?" my hoa
tess asked.
I followed her into the kitchen. The
potatoes were boiling as though bent on
doing their best for her and the roast
turned its brown face toward her wtih
the best intention possible. With the
deftness of a girl, and a capable one at
that, she whisked dishes, knives and
forks out and the table was set In no
"You see, living by myself. I know just
where everything is. I could find any
thing in this house In the dark Just as
well as I can now. So solitude has its
advantages, has it not?" she asked smil
ingly.
I couldn't dispute her. In fact. I
wouldn't dare even think when she was
about. Any woman who has had as
much experience and who knows life as
thoroughly as she does ought to have all
the hats iÂ» the country oft to her.
"There really Isn't very much more to
see," she said as she gave the biscuits a
last pat. Nothing but my garden, and
it does not look its best now on account
of the frost. But see that little hill over
there. In all the years I have been on
the coast we have had only one accident
that amounted to anything. The Pride
of the Sea came ashore one perfectly
clear night. She was lost. The people
around here are kind enough to say It is
because this light shines so far out to
sea that all has gone so well. And now
it is almost dinner time. Won't you stay
and dine with me?" she asked as sha
gathered a handful of flowers to brighten
Btory. claimed her as Its- very own. An<*
then she .Â«poke:
"You want to see the tower?" she asked.
"Yes," I mechanically answered, al
though I wanted to see her more than
anything: else about the place.
"Well, you must register first, you know.
Everybody does does that, and besides, I
am awfully curious about my guests*
names," aha Bald. .
And away went this little mite of a
woman with as spry a step as a girl of 13.
In a minute she came tugging an Immense
book Into the room and laid It down on
the top of the piano with a satisfied
'.'There you are."
"Now, let's Bee who will lose their ;
breath first. You go ahead of me. for I
may possibly have to push you along;."
The very Idea of a woman of nearly 80'
pushing me along 1 amuBed me. Probably
I would have to pick her up and carry her
under one arm.
Â¦ "But. ye gods! Those stairs start out In
a bee line for the pearly rates. They are
straight up and everlasting. In a few
minutes a hand was slipped under my
arm and a quiet voice said: "I told you
â¢ bo." Oh, the Irony of those few words.
The last flight is made of Iron and one
might almost as well try to climb a pole.
The tiniest hole to crawl through, and
then you are In the lighthouse proper.
The room Is round and In the center
stands the cylinder that casts It* rays
twenty-five miles out to sea.
"Don't touch itl In forty-five years I
have never put my hands on the glass."
"Have you really lived In this house
that length of time?" I managed to gasp.
""Why, yes, of course. The best years of
my life have been spent right here. I came
here In '56, when I was not quite thirty
one. In all that time I have stayed away
from the house Just one night. Now, I
will leave it to you. Most people claim
that women gad, gad all the time. They
never stay at home. Don't you think that
I have broken the record?"
I wonder If there Is another woman on
the face of the - globe who can say as
much.
"And have you tended the lamps all
that time?" I meekly asked.
""Why, of course, every night In all
those years, with the exception of three
weeks when my last boy was born. I
have three other boys and a daughter, you
knoV. When they were babies they
couldn't help me, and when they were
older I couldn't trust them. They always
forget; so, anyhow I put it. I had to
climb the stairs just the same. I always
felt more comfortable when I had set
them all going myself."
""When you set them going," I repeated,
"and when do you do that?"
"Why, at sundown, and again at mid
night. Twice a night the lamps must be
trimmed and filled. It is no trick when
one 13 used to it, although it is rather
spooky at 12. Every night I climb the
stairs and the shadows make all kinds
of weird lights on the walls. The house
is all alone and every noise sounds lqud
Â¦ and peculiar. If I go to bed before the
last light goe3 up. I am very apt to Im
agine all kinds of horrid things. Why,
my' own shadow makes grimaces at me
and nods and becks to come faster, and
then when I hurry it motions to go slower.
Did you ever hear of such fool stories?"
Heavens, if I had to climb those stairs
my knees would knock until the echoes
would mock me. Just imagine that little.

This has caused a violent protest on the
part of the women's rights societies of
Paris, and, as a counterblast, they have
got up a stamp which Is a duplicate of
the one issued by the Government, only
that on the tablet which the man holds is
written "Droits de la Femme"â the rights

of these stamps have been sold at 10
cents a hundred, and thousands of letters
which pass through the French post bear
the appeal for woman suffrage. The pos
cii authorities are much annoyed, for
Cxy have to look sharp to see which
Â«*mp to concel where the letter bears
both the male and the female stamps, and
also to see that a letter does not go

A singular thing is , revealed by the

iseem that the movement for the enfran

one large difference between our - press

faction. But the head of the- Government,
the Emperor, is never attacked under any
circumstances by any oneâ as your Mc-
Klnley was attacked by your press."--. *,
It was my turn to change the subject.
"Who are your famous Illustrators?" I
asked.', â¢
The interpreter, who should before have
been introduced as a cultured young stu
dent and host of Mr. Shimada, himself
answered smilingly: .
"You know.Mr. Shimada Is himself one
of our famous illustrators," a dictum that
has since been confirmed by a distin
guished connoisseur of Japanese art, him-
"McKinley!" I said at first glance.
"No, that is Gladstone," said Shimada.
and pointed, smiling, to the characteristic
collar, whose fame had reached even to
Japan.
There were humorous drawings, a vain
scientist with a literal "big head"; a
spirited sketch of a horserace; the return
of the Americanized Jap to his farmer
father and so forth. There were lovely
little sketches of architecture, illustra
tions of ancient fairy legends, exquisite
little landscapes, all handled in a free,
sure fashion, at once strong and delicate.
There were all sorts of portraits of all
kinds of people, unmistakably likenesses,
yet seen through Oriental eyes. There
were animal drawings, some ridiculously
clever chickens, some rather astonishing
horses, anything and everything, but all
showing a master's hand.
"We have in Japan our daily papers,
just as you," Shimada begins again.
I assent, though my acquaintance .with
the Oriental press has been limited to that
part of itfthat comes wrapped" around
Japanese porcelain at Christmas time.
You know the kind. ' It looks- to the un
initiated like the print of chickens' ' fee
in a. wet yard, spread in formal fashion
over a sheet about half as large again as
a War Cry.
"Oh, yes," the artist says proudly, "we
have papers with a daily circulation of
50.000 and 100.000. The .Tokio Ilochl, for
example, will run up fo the latter num
ber.
"The Hochi?â doubtless a sheet devoted
to art, literature, political reform and the
like?" I asked.
"Not exactly," stammers the trans
lator with comical embarrassment Then
It came out, bit by bit, to my unkind
amusement that the Hochi is the yellow,
yellow Journal ' of japan, devoting- most
of Its space to scandals In high life,
geisha 6crapes, political fiub-dub and red
hot news generally.
"But there are others?"" I suggest at
last to the artist, who was Industriously
covering as much of his expressive coun
tenance as would lie under a tiny tea
cup.
- "Indeed, yes!" he replied eagerly. "I

here. In fact Mr. Shimada has
been in town for some months,
but his identity with the distin
guished illustrator has so far xe
mained unsuspected. Neither would It be
known nowâ for the artist is as modest
as he is cleverâ if I had not happened to
knock down a small paper mountain in a
corner of his little studio on Pine street
the other day.
"What are these?" I demanded, as what
appeared to be pen drawings of every de
scription of subjectâ train wrecks, fires,
street crowds, ballet dancers. fes
tivals, portraits, caricaturesâ came flut
tering down in ail directions. They
were unmistakably Japanese, yet of
a kind of art that I' had never be
fore seen. Some recalled a "Whistler etch
ing, others reminded of Abbey or Hugh
Thomson, and the feeling of yet others
was distinctly French in its chic direct
ness. There was perspective of our kind
humor, with an Occidental appeal, and a
selection of subject known to the West
ern mind as "newsy," all foreign ele
ments in the more familiar Japanese art.
"What are these V" I asked again, hold
ing up a handful of the illustrations.
Mr. Shimada was seated tailor-wise on
his painting mat. surrounded by supple
brushes and little dishes of bright inks,
touchir.g in rapidly a few soldiers in a
copy of a curious old print of Commodore
Perry's landing in Japan. The drawing
lay flat on the mat before him and the
artist himself made a pleasing picture tn
his kimono of subdued grays and purples.
his keen yet gentle face, the color of oM
ivory, now bending for an intent moment,
over his work and again lifted with
courteous smile to his guests.
His friend and interpreter translated:
"Those? Oh, those were merely reprints
of some of his newspaper sketches. Did
1 like them? Would I not please choose
some from, among them and accept them
with Mr. Shimada's honorable regards?"
âwith the slightly embarrassing generos
ity of the hospitable Japanese.
'â¢Xo, it was too much," I said, but
changed my mind on seeing the little hurt
look en the expressive brown face. "Yes,
if I may; these delightful child faces will
give ne great pleasure. But I want to
know all about Japanese newspaper art."
i The gentle Oriental promptly placed his
time at my "honorable disposal," ordered
the indispensable tea. sweetmeats, and.
for a particular bonne bouche. what I
shamelessly confess held for me the gasp
and strangle of my first oliveâ the epicu
rean dried seaweed of Nippcn. Then, over
the toy teacups, I learned something
about the Japanese newspaper.
Shimada speaks no Englishâ with his
lips, by the wayâ but he has a full vocab
ulary of sparkling gesture and expression.
Half his story is told by the sensitive
artist hands; the face, fine, vivid and
eager, points the tale, and the translator
does the rest.
"This is not the kind of paper on which
jour newspapers are printed?" I asked.
pointing to the creamy, parchment-like
paper of the sketches.
"No, our newspaper paper is very bad â
rough, soft, thin, altogether bad," the
trtist replied. "It quite spoils the draw

Mrs. Nellie K. Blissett has written a
distinctly readable story in "The Most
Famous Loba." The scene is laid in the
romantic time of the Troubadours, when
men turned with equal ease to feats of
arms and to deeds of gallantry. "The
Most Famous Loba" is a woman re
nowned for beauty and for Independence
of thought and action. She moves a strik
ing, picturesque figure among the stirring
events of her time. In the chronicle of
the most interesting period of the life of
this beauty whose fascinations are grea:
enough to make all men who know her
her slaves, the author has caught well
the spirit of the time of which she writes,
and the reader Is made to see the beauty
as well as the cruelty of the period which
we know as the Age of Chivalry. (Pub

Mr. Anderson is the ; youngest [ artist 'â¢ of
his kind in America. He was born In
Nashville, Tenn.; 22 years ago. t As he at
an early age developed a talent for.draw
ing he was given opportunities in that
direction by private instruction, followed
later by a course in the Chambers School
of Art in Nashville. - While the artist' has
not entirely deserted his 'palette and
brush, he has become a sincere devotee
to camera craft and means by serious In
vestigation and time to prove that pho
tography will with the passing of the
years become a most important branch
of the higher art, - â¢ - â¢ - â¢ r -,
Mr. Anderson furthers the artistic suc
cess of his work in photography by paint
ing his own scenery or background, by
designing the costumes for | the models
and by carefully selecting the models
themselves. Many "of the fanciful con
ceits and the unusual poses are not only
attractive as pictures, but they can safely
be termed camera triumphs. The .. first
page of this Sunday Call's â¢ Magazine
Issue is an example of his splendid work.
This number marks the beginning of a ae-.'
ries of studies that. Mr. Anderson has
made especially 'for this paper.* "; ;'.
Some of the results of this unique idea
are equivalent | to art inspiration^ . In
these reproductions the models are ar
ranged like the original paintings, and
many of the pictures are ; almost perfect
imitations. The photographs are en
dowed with a life and soul; the camera
searches out and exhibits a detail which
the artist with brush seldom produces
with the same perfection on canvas. -
PERHAPS no other branch of art
has taken a greater stride In the
past few years than has that of
photography.
Where formerly it was confined
to a purely mechanical method of trans
ferring a face or a scene to a' : negative,
it has developed possibilities that closely
ally it with a higher art. No Individual
has done more to confirm the advance
ment in this comparatively new field than
has C. H. Anderson of the Elite studio,
San ' Francisco. During his three years'
devotion to the camera he has brought to
light some of the most wonderful produc
tions known to the world of photography
âthat of making V with .. living models
copies of original paintings by old and
modern masters. Â¦ : ! â¢

H. G. Wells la among the most logical,
forcible and fascinating prophets of the
future wonders of the world. He baa
hitherto confined his prognostications to
fiction, as in "ThÂ© War of thÂ© Worlds."
but he has now seriously approached the
subject of the future in a capital book
which he calls "Anticipations," which
will shortly be published in America by
the Harpers. Mr. Wells has gone thor
oughly into his subject, and covers not
only a forecast of what we shall accom
plish In mechanical development, but In
our civic and domestic progress aa well.
It is a book decidedly calculated to arouse
debate and stimulate thought. Prophe
cies of the future are the fashion at pres
ent, and the forecasts of men who prac
tically and logically outline great things
for the coming year3 are no longer to
be overlooked In an age when scientific
marvels have become prosaic facts of
our dally existence.

which is excited by a graphic account of a
strong situation. The White Guard,
which gives the book its name, is a small

an unpleasant story of successful char
latanism. : A woman, Madame Bonzales,
comes to America from Europe in order
to make converts to a new system of phi
losophy which, so she believes, has been
revealed to her by angel visitants. Mad
ame Bonzales Is a stupid, ignorant 'wo
man, and yet one who sincerely believe*
the nonsense which she preaches. On her
arrival In America she meets a clever,
unscrupulous man named Clendenin. In
Madame Bonzales Clendenin recognizes a
possible agent for his material advantage.
Madame Bonzales, so he thinks, has only
to be brought before the notice of the
public by a clever manager in order to be
come a fashionable fad, and. consequent
ly, a source of income to such a manager.
Clendenin persuades an acquaintance of
his, Thatcher Mitchell, to write clever ad
dresses for Madame Bonzales to deliver in
public. Soon, In fulfillment of Clendenic's
prediction, Madame Bonzales becomes a
fashionable "prophetess." "When Mitchell
discovers that he has played a prominent
part In making the success of a fraud he
is filled with remorse and tries, but in
vain, to open the eyes of the public to the
real character of Madame Bonzales and
her manager, Clendenin. To make mat
ters worse for Mitchell, the girl he loves
falls under the influence of Madame Bon
zales and bids fair to give up her fortune
to further the- interests of the new cause.
But Miss Bond soon finds out the falsity;
of Madame Bonzales' pretensions to wis
dom. So in one case Mitchell is relieved
of the mortification of having assisted a
false prophetess to dupe her victims.

The Story of the Art of Building.
A BOOK ON CALIFORNIA BY CHARLES
WARREN STODDARD.
Something like a hundred sketches and
photographs by. the author, two carica
tures in color by the noted French caric
aturist Sancha, and a water-color frontis
piece by F. Hopkinson Smith illuminate
the book, and, with the handsome cover,
make it particularly available as a gift
book. .. (Published by Funk & Wagnalls
Co., New York. Price, %\ 20.)
This being his method of work, he could
not fail to, get at the intimate secrets,
the subtle charm of the quarter. When
he pictures for us with brush and pen and
camera tho .balls and studios, the gri
settes, models, bicycle girls, shop girls,
sweethearts, students, singers, poets, bes
gars, sculptors, cafes, shops, boulevards,
etc., we see them, not as figures
in a guide book, but as the real, pulsing
elements of the , most fascinating Bohe
mian spot in all the world. We come into
closer touch with them than would be
possible In repeated summer, tours.
"Nowadays when a man would write of
the siege of Peking or the relief of some
South African town with an . unpro
nounceable name, his ' habit Is to rent
a room on an uptown avenue, move in an
Inkstand and pad, and a collection of il
lustrated papers and encyclopedias. This
"writer on the Rue Falguiere chose a. dif
ferent plan. He would come back 'year
after year and study his subject and com
pile his impressions of the quarter in the
very atmosphere of the place itself; with
in a stone's throw of the Luxembourg Gar
dens and the Pantheon; near the cafes
and the Bullier; next door, If you please,
to the. public laundry, where his washer
woman pays a few sous for the privilege
of pounding, his clothes Into holes."
Just such a man has made the capti
vating: book now under review, "The
Real Latin Quarter of Paris." F. Berke
ley Smith has put the seeing, and hear
ing, and feeling of/ ten years of intimacy
with the real Latin quarter into his book. 1
His celebrated father, j F. Hopkinson
Smith, says in his introduction to the
book:
â¢ The one who can best tell you the story
and paint the picture is the one who has
gone from other surroundings and habits
and has stayed to see and to study with
eyes and ears open, with senses alert,
sympathies keen and with a quick ap
preciation of all that will appeal to the
uninformed outsider.
There is a seductive charm about that
famous Bohemia of Parisâ the Latin
quarterâ which most persons know only
by reputation. Wherein this charm con
sists â¢ Is but vaguely understood. The
casual visitor, who has wandered through
the Quartler, or who, perhaps, has been
so fortunate asVto be taken through it
by one who knows it, cannot tell you of
Its fascinations. He cannot portray Its
life or interpret Its spirit. He cannot give
you any of the real atmosphere* of the
place or the true inwardness of its throb
blngr/sad-and-gay existence.'- He lias seen
very 'little of it himself and' has under
stood still less. It would be even more
impossible for a native, or one. who has
xpent all his life there, to give you.Jhe
kind of a picture which would appeal to
yourV' appreciation, your Imagination,
your emotions. He is a part of it; all is
natural and familiar to him and arouses
no surprise or curiosity. He docs not see
the contrasts or the unique manifesta
tions of life in their full color values. To
him It is a common and an every-day af
fair, and if he attempted to describe it
he would try to pick out the things that
seemed to him unusual rather than the
multiplicity of things that go toward
making up the real, perpetual charm of
life in the Latin quarter.
Heal Latin Quarter of Paris.
During the excitement following the
capture of the Federals Charlotte is shot
by Oliver, who has stolen near. Ferry
rusnes up and strikes Oliver with his
sword Both Charlotte and her husband
nave been wounded seriously, but both
recover eventually. For some time, how
ever, it is supposed by Charlotte and her
Mends that Oliver was killed outright.
During that time Ferry begs Charlotte to
marry him, but to no purpose. In Char
lotte s refusal lies the crucial point of the
story. Charlotte feels that If she marries
the man who killed her husband the world
will have the right to censure Â¦ her. and
that this censure will work to lower the
standard of a love which until then has
been kept upon a high moral plane. After
a prolonged period of suspense Oliver is at
last killed, and in a way that furnishes
one of the several very dramatic Incidents
in the book.
Besides the romance of the love of
Charlotte Oliver and Ferry, RichaK
Smith has one to relate on his own ac
count. The love episodes lend an added
attraction to a Beries of war pictures
which would be interesting even alone.
Not only Is the whole story interesting
but it is eminently clean and wholesome.
It makes clear what some writers of war
tales are apt to,, Ignoreâ that actual expe
rience of warfare is not necessarily de
grading. (Published by Charles Scribner'a
Sons. New York.)
Cries of masculine anger and Â¦ feminine af
fright filled the hall, but one ringing order
for silence hushed all and the dance stood still
with Ned Fciry in its center. In hlg right
hand, shoulder high, he held not his sword,
but Charlotte's fingers lightly poised for the
turn in the arrested dance.
"Stand, gentlemen; every man is covered by
two; look at the doors; look at the windows."

suspicion of what It stands for the stamping

man who "loves a good story with a positive
passion."

O, ladies. caper light-
Sweetest ladies in de land-

Now the third couple clasp hands, arch arms
and let the whole countermarching train sweep
through, and a beautiful arch they make, for
they are the aforesaid captain and Charlctte
Oliver. "Hands round'." hurrah for the whirl
ing ellipse, and now it's "right and left" and
two ellipses glide opposite ways, "to quile dat
golden chain." In the midst of the whirl, when
every hand Is in some other and ' men and
girls are tossing their heads to get their locks
out of their eyes, at the windows come un
noticed changes and two men loiter in by the
front hall door, close to the fiddler. One has
his sword on and each his pistols, and their
boots and mud-splashed uniforms of dubious
blue are wet and steamy. The one without the
sword rives the fiddler a fresh name to sing
out when the spinning ring shall straighten
Into its two gay ranks egaln and bids him â
Charlotte Oliver, fearing that her hus
band's method of executing vengeance
upon her will involve an unnecessary loss
of lives, both Northern and Southern,
goes to a general in the Federal army
and Implores him to have Oliver sent
North to some place where he will be un
able to send innocent men to their doom.
When Charlotte reveals her identity, as
she Is compelled 'to do, she is arrested as
a spy, and sent, for safe keeping, to the
.home of some Unionists. While she Is with
these people they give a dance, which she
is Induced to attend. The festivities are
interrupted in a very dramatic way by the
arrival of Ferry and his men, who have
come with the intention of capturing the
Federal officers at the dance. The ending
of the dance is described in this way:
"What! gone?" he asked again, and I
nodded. He turned and trotted lightly, after
the departing column.
With a few words to the sergeant, more brief
than harsh, and while the indomitable singers
pressed on to the very close of the stanza with
out a Elgn from him to desist. Ferry bade the
subaltern resume his command and turned to
ward me at the window. He lifted his sword
and spoke In a lowered tone, the sullen guard
stood to their arms and every captive looked
up for my reply.
"Shall I, come?" he inquired, but I shook my
head.
But the command to fire did not come; sud
denly there was a drumming of hoofs, then
their abrupt stoppage, and the voice of a vigi
lcnt commander called, "Attention!"
There Bounded a clean slap of leveled car
bines, yet from the prisoners came the con
tinued song In Its closing couplet:
"The star-spangled banner! Oh. long may It
wave'."
And out of the midst of its swell the oaths and
curses and defiant laughter of a dozen men
crying, with tears In their eyes, "Shoot! shoot!
v.-hy don't you shoot?"
"Club that man over the head!" cried the
sergeant of the guard, and one of his men
swung a gun; but the Yankee sprang Inside of
its sweep, crying, "Sing her through, boys'."
grappled his opponent and burled him back. In
the same instant the sergeant called steadily,
"Guard, ready, aim â " ,
Charlotte had ceased In consternation, not
for the conditions without more than for those
within. With the first long swell of the song
from below the dying leader strove to sit up
right and to lift his blade, but failed and
would have slammed back upon the pillows had
not she and Miss Harper saved him. He lay
in their arms gasping his last, yet clutching
his saber with a quivering hand and listening
on with rapt face untroubled by the fiery tu
mult of cries that broke Into and over the
strain. ? Â¦

but at the third, warily, first one, then thret,

could not see. The prisoners' guards, though
Instantly ablaze with indignation, were so ta
kon by surprise that for two or three seconds,
with carbines at a ready, they â and even their
sergeant in commandâ only darted fierce looks
here and there and up at me. The prisoners
must have been UEed to singing in ordered
chorus, for one of them strode into their
middle, and, smiling sturdily at the maddened
guard and me. led the song evenly. "No, sir'.'
he cried, as I made an angry sign for them to
desist, "onÂ« verse through, if every damned

Charlotte began guardedly to sing:
"Oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early

What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's

Charlotte Oliver's husband and her
father-in-law become traitors to the
South. Their treason comes to, tho
knowledge of the Southerners. Char
lottes husband is taken prisoner by
Ferry's men, but succeeds in mak
ing his escape to the Union army.
Thereafter he strives in every way he can
to kill his wife and Ferry, of whose love
for each other he is aware. In pursuance
of his plan of vengeance he gives to a Fed
eral officer information which leads him
to make an attack upon some Confederate
soldiers, among whom are the Scouts.
The Federals are beaten and tuken pris
oners. Their leader, Captain Jewett, who
has been mortally wounded, is taken with
the other prisoners to .a house where
Charlotte Oliver is staying. When the
captain is dying he asks Charlotte to sing

toward Major Harper's tent.
I asked if Ferry came often to headquarters.
â¢"Yes, quite aa often as be's any business
to."
"Ah, ha'." thought I, and presently said I
had heard he was a great favorite.
"Well â yes â he â he is â with eome."
"Don't you like him?"
"Who. me? Oh! â I â I admire Ned Ferry â
for a number of things. He's more foolhardy
than brave; he's confessed as much to me.
Women call him handsome. He sings, beauti
fully, I suppose; I can't sine a note and
wouldn't If I could. Still, If he only -wouldn't
fins drinking songs â but. Smith, I think to sing
drinking songs â and all the more to sing then
as well as eome folks think he does â is to ad
vocate drinking, and to advocate drinking is
next door to excusing drunkenness!"
"Then Ned Ferry doesn't drink?"
"Indeed, he does! I don't like to say it, and
I don't cay be drinks 'too much,' as they call
it; but. Smith, he drinks with men who do!
Oh, I admire him; only I do wish '
"WUh what?"
'â¢Oh. I â I wish he wouldn't play cards.
Smith, I've -seen him play cards with the shells
bursting over us!"
For my part I privately wished this saint
wouldn't rub my uninteresting surname Into me
every time he spoke. As we dismounted near
the tents I leaned against my saddle and asked
further concerning the object of his loving anx
iety. Was Ned Ferry generous, pleasant,
frank?
"Why, in outward manner, yes; but. Smith.
he was raised to be a Catholic priest. I could
* heap sight easier trust him If he'd sometimes
â¢how distrust himself. If he ever does I've
never 6een it. And yetâ oh, we're the best
of friends, and I'm cpeaking now only as a
friend end to a friend. Oh, If it wa'n't for Just
one thing. I could admit what Major Harper
aald of him not ten minutes tLgo to me that you
never finish talking to Ned Ferry without feel
ing a little brighter, happier and cleaner than
when you began; whereas, talking with tome
men It's Just the reverse."
I looked carefully at my companion and
asked him If the major had said all of that.
He had, and Gholson's hide had turned it with
out taking a scratch. "That's fineâ as to
Ferry," 1 said.
"Oh. yesâ It would be â If It were only Â«>.
Trouble Is, you keep remembering- he's such a
stumbling block to any real spiritual Inquirer.
Tes, and to himself; for, you know, spiritually
there's so much less hope for the moralist than
there is for the up-and-down reprobate! You
know that â Smith."
My silence implied that I knew it, though I
Â«Jid not feel any brighter, happier or cleaner.
"Smith, Ned Ferry la not only a Romanist,
he's a romanticist. We â you and me are re
ligionists. Our brightness and happiness air
the brightness and happiness of faith; our
cleanness is the cleanness of religious scruples.
Worst of it with Ned Is he's satisfied with the
difference, I'm afraid. That'a what makes him

]N "The Cavalier" George W. Cable
has written a historical novel of more
than ordinary merit. The story it tells
is of sustained interest, while its style
has the usual charm of Cable*6 work.
There are not, to be sure, those passages
of musical prose found in other books of
his, *ut perhaps there is no particular
place for them In a record of the vicissi
tudes of war, which this Is. The scene of
"The Cavalier" Is laid In Mississippi dur
ing the closing period of the Civil War.
The principal character is Edgard Ferry -
Durar.d, an "officer in the Confederate
army. Durand. cr Ferry, as he is usually
called, is a brilliant, dashing soldier, an
example of the best type of the courage
ous, chivalrous Southerner. Ferry is the
leader of a famous band of cavalrymen
known as "Ferry's scouts." These men
are a picked company, who sweep over
the country to gather information of the
movements of the Federal armies. The
ctory Is supposed to be related uy a young
roan named Richard Smith. Smith is at
flrst a private in the Confederate forces,
and then one of Ferry's scouts.
There Is at the time the story opens a
Â¦woman named Charlotte Oliver living
near the headquarters of that division of
the Confederate army to which the scouts
are attached. This woman is the wife of
a precious rascal, whose cruelties have
become so unbearable that she has had to
separate from him. In order to support
herself che has become a war correspond
ent. Mrs. Oliver is beautiful, fascinating
and intensely loyal to the South. She is .
& epy for the Confederates. Under a pre
tense of devotion to the North she In
gratiates herself with some of the North
ern commanders stationed in the South,
and from them obtains passes through
the Union lines. She even pretends to
serve the North In the capacity o^ a se
cret agent. The liberty of movement al
lowed Mrs. Oliver Is utilized by her. of
course, for the benefit of the South. Fer
ry and Mrs. Oliver meet, and between
them there grows up an affection whicn
Is none the less deep because it is un
avowed.
There is a despicable character In the
book, Scott Gholson, who is a clerk of one
of the Confederate generals. This Ghol
son endeavors to make a simulation of re
ligious devotion conceal the envy and
hatred he feels toward those who possess
the good Qualities he lacks. Gholson en
tertains a particular dislike for Lieuten
ant Ferry, partly through Jealousy of the_
esteem In which Ferry is held and partly
because he suspects Ferry's affection for
Charlotte Oliver, with whom he himself is
In love. The character of Gholson, with
its mixture of low cunning, hypocrisy and
assured eelf-esteem, is very cleverly
rawn. The following: scene takes place
oetween Richard Smith and Gholson,
when Smith is not yet acquainted with
Ferry:
of the great moral truths which form the
fundamental part of all religious systems.

In the end the genius of Hume meets
with acknowledgment and reward, and
the reader takes leave of him endowed
with the fame for which he served a long
apprenticeship. (Published by R. F. Fenno

Again Hume decides to sacrifice himself
for the sake of the happiness of Lepage's
wife. He leads the relief expedition. Alter

When he recovers from the long illness,
which follows his exposure to the Arctic
cold, Lepage confesses to Hume his crime
and begs forgiveness.
their v own nafe return, is a matter of
grave doubt. The leader of the relief par
ty is Jasper Hume, who has a particular
reason for going: to Seek Lepage.
; Hume and Lepage were once Intimate
friends, members of the same profession,
and In love -with the same woman. Hume
had just perfected a new invention, which
he had not yet published, when his health
failed," and he was ordered to a warmer
climate for a year. When he returned
home it was to discover that Lepage had
married the woman, and had given to the
world as his own the Invention of Hume,
which had been left in Lepage's care. For
the sake of Mrs. Lepage Hume suffered in
silence the wrong which had been clone
him. He allowed Lepage to reap the ben
fit of his work, and to be -.hailed by the
world as a genius. Hume retired into the
distant north, and there for ten years
worked and waited until he had brought
to perfection another Invention. Hume
was about to make this public when there

message about the disappearance of Le-

Uncle Jam's Conscience fund.
IN the year 1811 an anonymous citizen
of New York sent a dollar to tha
Treasury Department at Washington
with an avowal that he had defrauded
the Government and wanted to make
restitution. A dollar meant something to
Uncle Sam In those necessitous days when
the country verged on wax with Great
Britain, and It was a patriotic as well as
a penitent act The contributor was tha
founder of the conscience fund, and prob
ably ho died in the odor of sanctity. Dur
ing the preceding thirty-five years of the
life of the republic no one had despoiled
the Government,* or the private conscience
was callous. This New York man. Indeed,
seems to have been the one blemish on a
golden era of national virtues, for fifty
years were to elapse before there was an
addition to the fund. In 1861, Just after
Sumter was fired on. the sum of $6000 In
bonds was received by the Treasury De
partment with a letter explaining that a
sorely tried conscience could no longer en
dure Its burden of guilt. Tha plain infer
ence was that the sender,* realizing the.
United States would need a mint of money
to carry on the war, Judged It not to be a
time to defer repentance. ,Thlnk of the
bounty. Jumpers who profited by his fat
contribution! It was really useful to the
country In another way. The conscience
fund, which had languished for want of a
shining now became active. It
has been quoted pretty steadily ever since.
At the present time It amounts to more'
.than 1300,000. Indeed, restitution Is get
ting to be the fashion, and the time may
come when do one' will take advantage of
the Government, or do so only with the
laudable design of swelling the conscience
fund when any emergency Un
cle Sam.
Nothing is more curious than the puny
deceits which the regenerate sometimes
practices when contributing to the con
science fund, matching their cunning, as it
were, against the detective skin of an out
raged Government. A Pomeroy (Ohio)

" 'An' then,' asks Enright, 'whatever

" 'Coifs six-shooter,' says Enright.
" 'Seein' the old gent." says the pin

the piufeather party exhibits a bullet
wound in his left forearm, the same bein'
about half healed.
" "But whatever's the call for you to
elope at all?' remonstrates Enright; 'the
simple way now would be to round up
this yere lady's paternal gent, an" get his
consent.'
" 'Which I'm out to elope a whole lot
from Tucson," explains this yere pin
feather party to Enright, 'an' I aims to
cinch the play. I'm a mighty cautious

Most of us is full of presentments that

Dave walks in. A sigh of relief goes up,
for the glance we gives him shows he's
all ' rightâ sane as Knrightâ Â«lothed an* in

Also, his countenance is a wrinkle of glee.

her post: an' we, feedln* ourse'fs, sort o*
keeps us busy, an' we don't find mucH

" 'Of course. I could ask her more ques

didn't deem It wise. Missis Rucker Is a
most admirable character; but I'm sooper
stitious about crowdin' her too dost. Lika

you only goes about its development the

" 'Which the sltyooatlon Is too many for

" 'Then you do know. Missis Rucker,*

Boggs, after Peets pulls his freight an*
leaves us no wiser than when he shows in
the door, 'makes me desp'rate. I'll make)
thi3 motion: Let's all prance over In a

much as ever he has to Peets, an* thar's
no professional hobbles on the lady; she's
free to speak.*
"This yere's as far as Peets'll go. Ha

" 'Da\e may be boisterous later,* says
Peets, an* his reply comes slow an*

make a Joyful uproar, but he won't wax
dangerous.*
" 'Tell us at least, Doc,' says Enrijht,
â¢whether Dave's likely to grow voylent.
If he is, it's only proper that we arranges
to tie him down.'
" 'Tell you-all folks what's the natter
with Dave?' says Peets. 'Pards, It's sim

"For a full hour we does nothin" btrf
canvass this yere question of Dave's
aberrations. At last a idee seizes us.
Thar's times when Dave's been aeea
caucusin' about with Missis Rucker an*
Doc Peets. Most likely one of 'em's ablÂ»
to shed a ray on Dave. By a excellent
coincidence, an' as if to he'p U3 out,
Peets comes In Just as Texas Thompson
Eu'gests that mebby he's qualified to on
ravel the mystery.
" 'Which I'm rehearsin',* says Dave, an*
he shows "he's Impatient. 'Don't coma

Dave. 'I'm like the ancient Romans;
I've got troubles of my own; an' no sport

an' stilted an' pulls his freight an' leaves
us more onsettled than at first.

"At; this Cherokee : nacherally, an' in a
horrified way, stops, an' we-all, looks at

gesture toward Dave an' says: : 
'' 'Gents, first callin' xyour attention to

that no nose paint theory is possible in

shows her views on this point pretty
clearly.
During her visit to this country last sea
son she offered to give an hour each day
to a young kinswoman who had a prom
ising voice. The hour set for the lesson
was 11 o'clock, and at 11 each day many
warbles could be heard coming from the
diva's room, where her singles school of
one pupil was going on.
One day the pupil failed to appear.
Madame Nordica met her later in thÂ«
day and anxiously Inquired why she had
not come for her lesson. "You were HIT"
she asked earnestly, with a voice full of
sympathy.
"Oh. no." replied the girl In an off-hand
manner. "But It was too hot to work."
"Hot!" exclaimed the diva. "My dear,
if you expect ever to rise to the top, you'll
find it hot all the way up."
self. On* of tli* things which has'attract
ed most attention is a lullaby.
"The Southern lullaby which I have been
singing Is not a 'coon' song." shÂ» said.
"The music is by Ethelbert Nevln and thÂ«
words by frank L. Stanton. Any one hav
ing the least acquaintance with Kevin's
music would know that it could not be
ragtime. It Is a slmplÂ» melody, a sweet
little Southern lullaby, which. I havÂ» suns
aa an encore after a heavy protframme of
the most difficult musicâ Just a little fun
and relief for the moment, you know.
"I like to keep up a variety of music.
My programme contains every known
style of ballade-German lleder, French
chansons, Hungarian, Italian and English
ballads, besides selections from opera and
oratorio."
"I am determined that the feature' of
my concerts shall be range and variety of
what is best, and the programmes tax my
voice to the- fullest capacity. Soms sing
era rive *a whole" evening to onÂ© styla of
composition, and for some of the audi
ence It may be delightful, but In a general
way it does not gtr- compile satisfac

work, which she loves. She has little pa

V V that are all her own.
She, with her manager, her ac
companist. E. Romayne Simmons, and
two slaters. Mrs. Baldwin of Boston and
Mrs. Walker of New York, make up the
party who are Journeying across the con
tinent in a private car for the son* re
cital tour, which is to extend through, the
East, West. North and South of the
United States and through Canada as
welL
The car Is named Brnnnhilde In honor
of v the role In which Mme. Nordica has
made some of her biggest triumphs. It
has been especially fitted for her use, so
that the diva may experience as few
discomforts as possible In her long Jour
ney that will cover four or five months
and many thousands of miles.
A genuine brass bed. daintily draped, is
In her own room on this car, taking the
place of the ordinary berth or couch. A
canopied dresser is also there and easy
chairs, all upholstered in as fragile ma
terials as in your bÂ«st boudoir on terra
firma. A bath opens out from the room
and furnishes what Mme. Nordica calls
her "refuge"; she always says that the
one reason she is not a perfect traveler Is
that she likes too well to be clean.
In the car are several other sleeping
and dressing rooms and dining room and
kitchen. The rest of the car Is Bet aside
for the observation Bection, which takes
the place of living-room, music-roonj,
parlor and library.
In this are Nordica's favorite books.
There are some charming book shelves
that fit into odd corners, little curtained
nooks that remind Nordica of her own
home. She ha6 brought with her on her
trip as many of her treasures as she can
contrive to carry, so that the dreariness
of the road is entirely disguised.
A charming desk occupies one corner of
the room. Here the singer keeps up with
her correspondence and enlivens the trip
by chatting with her friends on paper.
In this room Is the piano. Therefore
it Is the room where the privileged few
love to gather, for here Mme. Nordica
entertains them from time to time with
the songs that they choose from her long
repertoire.
Nordica opened her tour In Pennsylva
nia about the middle of November. Since
then she has been working her way west
In the^ private car.
She is said to be carrying some swell
gowns. They are all Worth creations.
One. a cloth of gold, is .embellished with
lace that Is valued by experts at 60,000
francs; another, of grass green velvet. Is
unadorned, except for exquisite neck
garniture of rare old Irish point lace. Her
jewels, which Include a tiara and a col
lar, are gorgeous in their brilliancy.
Not the least Important personage in
the party now touring the country In the
car Brunnhilde Is a diminutive dachs
hund only a few months old, which is the
diva's latest and most highly prized pet.
The little animal was presented to her
by the Prince Regent of Bavaria on the
opening of the new "Wagner Theater In
Munich, when, by special Invitation, Mme.
Nordica sang Isolde and Elsa- in the
dedicatory ceremonies. It was conslderei
a most unusual honor, for she was tha
only foreign Einger to appear in the thea
ter to sing in German at the dedication of
the temple of the great German master.
Tuffy, the dachshund. Is blue In color
and truly blue Mooted, and is a. mest
dainty and mannerly little fellow who
never thinks of biting and seldom barks.
He wears a silver collar presented to
Mme. Xordiea by the Duch<vs of Meck
lenburg, who, as the daughter of the
reigning house, was at liberty to have
the collar made in the design of an an
cient bracelet kept in the "Green Cave"
of Dresden, the famous royal art treas
ury of Saxony. Jt is against the law to
copy any cf the treasures of the collec
tion, but, of course, royal permission In
Saxony has special prerogatives.
Nordica passed the summer in the Black
Forest and gained wonderfully in health.
Her energy is always great and, like
Bernhardt, slie takes a rest by changing
her occupation. Last summer, hid away
in the famous forest of Germany, she oc
cupied her leisure time in writing a book
â"Hints for Singers." As she sings every
opera from "Don Pasouale" to "Gotter
dammerung" she ought to be able to
give the young singer a few tips that are
worth while.
A little story of her during her sum
mer's sojourn in the forest has leaked
out. It seems that she and her husband,

The defense asked the same question
several times as to the different persons
present, and the prosecution objected
strongly. Judge Harrington sMstained
objections to the questions. The defense
said it wanted to Impeach Morris, he havi
Ing made contrary statements In and out
of court. The court said: '
"I made that statement in substance. I
told Boyd that I had nothing to fear; that
I knew nothing "of the lynching and that
I would go to Alturas."

of the counsel for the defense) at Look

of the counsel for the prosecution) had
gone to your ranch and told your uncle
that if you went to Alturas you would be
shot, and taking you aside, warned you
not to go to Alturas?" he was asked.
Morris replied In j_the negative.
The defense this morning resumed the
cross-examination of Witness Morrfs.
Spencer asked the witness if his father,
when on his deathbed or at any timf>
after the lynching, had said: "I could
die happy if I knew E. S. Trowbridge
(the men had been enemies) was one of
those lynchers and would hang for it." _

Adjournment
rJD^sExdtemmtEnds
The Prince will come to Washington
from New York, arriving here on the
morning of February 24. He will be met
at the station by a handsome military
escort and conveyed to the German Em
bassy. He will next visit the President
at the White House and the President
Â¦will return his call at the German Em
bassy. Monday evening the Presidential
party and the Prince wljl leave Washing
ton for New York and they will see the
launch at 10:30 o'clock Tuesday morning.
This plan involves a return to Washing
ton of the entire party and U is" likely
that on the 20th the Prince will be enter
tained at dinner at the White House. On
the 27th he is to be one of the company
present at the Capitol when Secretary
Hay delivers the McKlnley memorial ad
dress to Congress. Â¦
The committee charged with the ar
rangements for the reception and enter
tainment of Prince Henry to-day decided
it would be Impossible to yield to the re
quests of many cities to have the Princa
visit them. It is likely that besides New
York, Washington and Niagara Falls the
Journey will include Chicago only of the
Urge cities. It also was decided, owing
to the tide, to ha\-e the launch occur on
the original date, February 25, This will
necessitate two trips' on the part of the
Prince between New Tork and "Washing
ton.
"His Royal Highness will, I know,
deeply regret his inability to accede to
all the kind desires of those who have
communicated with the embassy. But be
v.lll accept the invitations as evidence of
the cordiality of tne feeling which ex
ists for Germany". It seems to me that
the display of hospitality which the
"United States Government and the Amer
ican people are preparing to make will go
far to disprove the reports which come
x;p now and then that there is a spirit of
hostility prevalent in this country against
Germany. Those reports are calumnies
spread by parties desirous of creating
trouble between two nationalities which
are bound by many ties. Germany does
not seek the disruption of these ties. On
the other hand she desires that they
shall be drawn tighter and that the two
countries shall move along the path of
civilization, mutually assisting each other
to gain greater and more glorious pros-
Xjerity. The fact that Emperor William
lias ordered Prince Henry and other high
cignitaries of the German Government to
visit the Ignited States and exchange
greetings with President Roosevelt can
be only accepted as an evidence of the
warmth of friendship entertained by his
ilajesty for the President and people of
this land." â¢ -
"From all sections . of your country I
have received dispatches and letters in
viting the Prince to a thousand functions,
Â¦which the authorities are prepared to give
In his honor.
"It is a matter of sincere gratification
to the Emperor and of personal gratifica
tion to myself that the Government and
people of the United States are taking
such deep Interest in the Impending visit
of Prince Henry of Prussia.
Statement by Embassador.
President Roosevelt personally ex
pressed to Herr von Holleben, the Ger
man Embassador. to-day his gratification
o\-er the coming- visit cf Prince Henry of
r > r-aEEia. In relation to toe visit of bis
Pu3vai Highness the Einbassador consent
ed to raake this statement to The Call:
does not believe that Emperor 'William
lias a strong motive underlying his efforts
to establish the most cordial relations
v.:ih the United States, -in connection
\rith the friendly overtures of ; the Em
peror it was stated to-day that they are
the outgrowth of the frank talk which
the President and Heir von Holleben re
cently had in connection with the Mon
roe doctrine. The Ambassador made It
plain to the President that his Govern
ment had no intention of occupying or
ac-qtiiring American territory. It waa
highly gratifying to Roosevelt, and he re
plied that the United States had no pur
pose of forbidding the collection by Eu
ropean po-svers of just debts held against
South and Central American republics.
The President is therefore given credit
for the good understanding which was
established and the subsequent courtesies
offered by Emperor William are undoubt
edly tie result Â«f-tfie "exchange of views

By the route he advocates from deep
water of the Pacific to deep water of the
Atlantic Ocean the. distance Is only
twenty-nine miles, while irom high tide
on the Pacific to high tide on the Atlantic
the distance* is only eighteen miles. The
proposed route terminates on each side in
good harborsâ the harbor of Darien on
the Pacific side and the Gulf of Daritn
on the aide of the Atlantic.

cate of % the so-called Darlen route and

PARIS, Jan. 18. â It Is - here
that If the sale of the property of the
Panama Canal Company is concluded
juris-consults will be appointed to decide
Â¦whether a ratification by a French tribu
nal is required or whether the vote of a
general meeting of stockholders will suf
fice., In any case, however, it will be a
matter of form. Â¦ No obstacle is antici
pated on that score. i.V.. >;"-
No action has yet been taken by. the
Senate looking to the printing of the
maps which were prepared by the Isth
mian Canal Commission. The main body
.of the report has been printed, but when
the Printing Committee came to get an
estimate of the cost of printing the/;elab
orate maps, it was rather surprised to
find that the cost would be $87,000. The
committee hesitated to recommend such
a heavy expenditure and will leave the
matter to the Senate. There are all told
eighty-Six of these maps, some of which
run as high as fourteen sheets, and from
an engineering standpoint are of great
technical value.
The publication of the fun Panama re
port is expected to furnish the friends of
that route with valuable ammunition.
Then 'the discussion of the merits of the
two routes by. the engineers, most of
whom side with Panama, la expected to
do damage to Nicaragua. Â¦ " :
* "All I can say about the report* Is that
It , is likely to be a disappointment tt> the
public generally." â¢ .
1 This is taken to mean that whils. the
.report: may not be unanimous, it is suffi
ciently strong In favor of Panama as to
make the recommendation that the Pan
ama route be adopted instead of Nicar
agua. The first great fight over the canal
under the. changed conditions brought
about by the Panama offer. will come up
in the Senate committee at an early day.
Senator Morgan is expected to get a vote
in committee without much delay, realiz
ing that the longer he puts it off the
more remote the chances of Nicaragua
became. He will not ask for a vote, how
ever, until -the. return of Senator Hanaa,
who went to Cleveland on business to
night to be gone for several days. Sen
ator Hanna has come . to be regarded as
the leader. of the movement to have all
routes carefully examined. As the xo'm
mittee stands now it is still for Nicar
agua. How^long it will remain so' is &
matter of conjecture.
Rear Admiral Waiker, chairman of the
Isthmian Canal Commission, when he left
the meeting. room of the board to carry
the final report to the "White House, said:
. Democratic Senators see more clearly
than Republicans, who are preparing to
squabble over the advantages of the re
spective routes, that there is likely to be
no canal legislation this session and are
preparing to put all the responsibility
on the majority In the Senate. They are
looking to the defeated Nlcaraguan canal
project to furnish them with a campaign
issue at the next Congressional elections. .
They are going to rally to the cry of
"Nicaragua or nothing," and If they can
ever get the question on the floor of the
Senate, will' line up almost solidly in
favor of the Nicaragua route.

LAS PALMAS, Canary Islands, Jan. IS.
âA cyclone has swept over the Canary
Islands, doing much damage to property
and causing a shipwreck.
The explosion was said to have been
caused* by a spark from electric light
wires Igniting gas which had leaked fro:u
the gas company's pipes into the subway
excavation at the corner of Tremont and
Boylston streets.
Previously the courts had found the
Boston â¬Jas Light- Company and the Edi

Next .Monday when the damage cases
are called in court, on continuance, tho
announcement will be made that the Edi

tion will mean the payment of at least
$500,000 of the damage claims by the Edi

There was especial reference to the fact
that his father is District Judge to the
Indiana District and the point was made
that with the son occupying the Circuit
bench it might fall to .his lot to review his
father's decisions. There was, however,
a general expression to the end that the
prominence of a man's father should not
be allowed to stand as a bar to his own
preferment. It was suggested also. that
in such cases Judge Baker's own delicacy
could be. depended upon to find a proper
solution of the problem. This view was
accepted .and the decision favorable to
report the nomination was not opposed.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 18.â The
Senate Committee on Judiciary to-day
agreed to report favorably the nomination

voice, accompanied by wild gestures and
the Judge's eyes flashed. After the re
tirement of the jury Raker arose and in
a quiet voice asked to present a matter
of importance to the court.
"X will not. listen to It." said the court,
but, quiet being restored, Raker said:
"This morning I presented to your
Honor habeas corpus papers in the cases
of eight men. The men are conflne'd in
Jail and we desire that a writ be made
obtainable this atfernoon."
"No, sir; 10 o'clock Monday morning,"

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
\V. f WASHINGTON, ""Jan. 18.â Marshaled
by Representative William Alden Smith,
the beet sugar delegation from Michigan
called en/ President Roosevelt this after
noon and uslicd him if he and Congress
btood for tho farmers or the sugar trust;
In others wcrds. Oxnard or Havemeyer.
â¢The President said he stood for the ro-
Hei fcr the people of Cuba if it could be
done without material injury to the in
tiustry in this country. Further than this
li'ie delegation received no satisfaction at
the White House. Smith and F. R. Hath
away, secretary of the Michigan Sugar
Manufacturers' Associaticn, nled a staie
ment for the consideration of the Presi
dent, calling- to his attention the growth
of the beet sugar industry in this coun
try, and particularly in Michigan under
the wing of Republican protection.
They called to his attention the planks
in the two last Republican platforms,
pledging the party absolutely to protec
tion for sugar growers. They said that
vwo months after the Dingley law wae
enacted â¢ the erection of beet sugar fac
tories in Michigan began and now there
are thirteen in operation. 'Last year the
State raised 66,400 acres of beets, yielding
Â£96,600 tens for which 16,848 farmerb re
ceived Â§3,107,520. Altogether 34,000 persons
found employment in this industry.
"We cannot stand any reduction," tho
delegation told the President, "in the tar
iff en raw sugar, especially such reduc
tion as will only serve to aid the sugar
trust."
The delegation put the political side of
the present controversy before the Presi
dent as follows:
"Because the Republican party has al
ways kept its promises Michigan has
been ever true to that party's principles.
To-day her sons believe that the sacred
pledge given in 1893- and reaffirmed in
1900, the pledge upon which we have al
ready invested over $10,000,000. : will be
kept inviolate. We cannot believe that
the industry thus inauguarated will be
ruined by the very political party which
gave it birth."
President Roosevelt showed interest in
the situation, but no indication of reced
ing from the position taken by the ad
ministration at the opening of Congress.
With Secretary Root and Governor Gen
eral Wood he is still firm in the opinion
that something must be done for â¢ Cuba
during the present session or there -will
be serious trouble in the island. There
is no indication of any material change
of position among leading members of, the
House in spite of the avalanche of beet
sugar sentiment 'that has come in from
the West.
Members of the Ways and Means Com
mittee have not shown their hand aur
fng the first week of the hearings ex
cept to informally reaffirm their opinion
that 20 per cent or 25 per cent reduction
in Dingley rates on Cuban sugar can be
allowed if it is developed as the hearing
progresses that this will not serieusly
affect the beet sugar raisers and cane
planters of Louisiana.
Senator Platt of Connecticut and other
leading members of the upper branch,
who are likely to have great influence
in settling this question in the Senate,
still take the view that such a reduction
can be allowed without injury in America.
Missionary Is Murdered.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.â A cablegram
Â¦was received at the State Department to
day from Consul McWade at Canton,
stating -that a French missionary had
been murdered by the natives of Nan
huing, Kwangtun province, 250 miie.-i
northwest of Canton. .
In recogriition of its arduous service in
the Chinese and Philippine campaigns the
Secretary has ordered the Ninth Infantry,
with the ercept'on o f Company B, on duty
as legation guard at Peking, to return to
San Francisco late in the spring. .
The regiments which have -been ordered
relieved from duty in the Division of the
Philippines will upon arrival at San Franr
clsco proceed to stations to be designated
by the department commanders as fol
lows: Fourth Infantry, to the Depart
ment of Texas; Seventeenth Infantry, to
the Department of the Columbia; Twen
tieth Infantry, to the Department of the
Lakes; Twenty-second Infantry, to the
Department of the Missouri; Ninth Infan
try, to. the Department of the Dakotas.
Ihe Twenty-ninth Infantry and second
battalion, Fifteenth Infantry, will bo
placed en route to San Francisco and will
report to the commanding general. De
partment of California, for embarkation,
respectively, on the transports sailing
February 16 and March 1.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.â That the
War Department does not think the situ
ation in the Philippines admits of a' sub
stantial reduction of General ChafCee's
army is shown by an order issued to-day
ordering 5000 men to proceed to Manila.
This force will take the place of flve regi â¢
ments now on their way home.
Under the order Issued by the Secretary
these troops will immediately begin prep
arations for departure for the Far East:
Second squadron, First Cavalry; second
squadron, Fifth Cavalry; first battalion,
Second Infantry; headquarters and Com
panies A, B, E, F, G. I. K and L, Seventh
Infantry; first battalion, Eighth Infantry;
headquarters, band and first battalion,
Tenth Infantry; second battalion," Elev
enth Infantry; second battalion, -Fifteenth
Infantry, and Company L, Twenty-fourth
Infantry. .-'Â¦...
Root said that no religious question was
involve.'!, as it was simply a condition
that existed and was fully recognized.
The friars themselves were so fully alive
to the conditions that thÂ«y would doubt
less be ready to dispose of- their lands.
At all events, Root said, they were a part
oÂ£ an organization,- and he apprehended
that the disposition "of : the' lands would
be determined b'y higher church authori
ties than the friars themselves.
Aguinaldo had taken advantage of this
intense feeling of the tenants against ttie
lriar landlords. The Secretary said that
the most important thing to be done at
this time was to dispose of the friar
question, as it was felt that when landed
proprietorship was brought to an end
most of the agitation -would be disposed
of. The friars had been driven from the
land in many cases, he said, ar;d if they
returned the people would kill them. Ap
peals had been made to the War Depart
ment to collect the rente due, but the
Secretary said this could not be done
withouc the use of troops.
Secretary Root began his statement by
explaining the enormous power which
the religious orders had long exercised
in the Philippines. They were represent
ed at Madrid and the Archbishop was
quite as powerful as . the Governor Gen
tral of the islands. The orders have
largely supplanted the native priests. As
a result of tho great political power of
the orders the friars became the medium
cf communication between the local par
ishes and the central government. They
l:eld large tracts of land amounting to
tbout 400.000 acres at the time of Ameri
can occupation. The people rented the
lands and thus a landlord and tenant sys
tem was now in operation. This caused
intense hatred, and Root said the feeling
of .the tenant classes was not "equaled in
bitterness by anything in Ireland.
The Secretary said the religious orders
so fully realized the, bad condition of af
fairs that they were disposed to sell out,
and he! urged that the Government take
advantage of the opportunity to remove
the chief causes of discontent in tho isl
ands. He did not believe condemnation
proceedings would be necessary, as there
were Indications that, a fair price could
be agreed upon. A rough estimate of the
value of the lands, he said, was trom
live to seven and a half millions of dol
lars, American money.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.â Secretary
Root v.-as heard on the question of the
friar !r>nds in the Philippines before the
House Committee on Insular Affairs to
day. He said these landhoIUings consti
tuted one of tho chief causes of discon
tent among the people; they were tho
hotbeds of insurrection and had furnished
Aguinaldo . his chief appeal to popular
prejudice.

2. The weather in'the southern part of the State became cloudy last night and rain is
predicted for that section to-day. , .
Forecaster McAdie says that the dry season has come to an end and that the usual
winter weather may now be expected. Only .8 of* an inch of rainfall was registered for
San Francisco yesterday, but considerably more is reported from some of the northern towns.
On January 2 .14 of an inch of rain fell, and the last wet weather before that was
early in December. The long period of clear weather is ascribed by the officials to the ex
istence of a high air pressure over Utah and Idaho, which prevented the storm winds passing.
Showers are predicted for the whole State forÂ«to-day. The wind, it is said, will be south
easterly and very strong off shore.

To Company Commanders : I wish to direct
the attention of your respective commands to
rule 36 of the Rules and Regulations of the

special privileges and I .think I am fully quali
fied to Judge of the merit of every man on the
force without any outside Interference. Effi
ciency and good conduct will be the standard
which I will recognize when the occasion
offers. "Pull"- will cut no figure.
GEORGE W. WITTMAN, Chief of Police.
The rule which the Chief refers to reads
as follows: .. . , .
It will be considered & cause for dismissal
from the force for the members to Importune
the Commissioners or the Chief of Police to
grant sueclal privileges to any of the said
members. No member of the police force shall
take any active measure in any proceeding to
appoint, promote, suspend, disrate or dismiss
any member of the deDartment except at the
request of the Board of Police Commissioners.

LONDON, Jan. IS.â The most important
event of the reassembling of Parliament
Â¦was undoubtedly the emphatic declara
tion of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman,
Liberal leader in the House of Commons,
that the Liberal party is still committed
to home rule. This was so utterly at
variance with Lord Rosebery*s Chester
field speech that It was taken to com
pletely nullify the other passages of Sir
Henry's opening epeech, in which he en
deavored to conciliate the Rosebery fac
tion.
The Spectator says this renalllng of the
home rule flag to the Liberal mast Is a
"new and -violent repudiation of the im
perialist wing." In other quarters the
home rule announcement has been taken
to be a de facto bid for the support of the
Irish Parliamentary party, but this does
not appear to be a probable contingency.

Wardrobe folding bed
y Three useful articles of furniture are here combined in one â¢
p handsome pieceâ a folding bed, a wardrobe and a cheval mir-
I ror. Considering: its many uses and conveniences, this is one
of the most inexpensive pieces of furniture on the market
to-day. . .
It is built of oak, with quartered oak panels, and is finished
golden color. When opened out aa a bed it measures 6 feet 3
inches lone by 4 feet wide.- When closed it is only to, inches
wide and 26 inches deep. The bed frame works on steel arms
i at each side and locks automatically when opening and clos-
ing. The lees also operate automatically when opening: and
i dosing. It would take two men to close the bed when two
people are occupying it, and then some one would be compelled
to hold the lock open, as it is impossible to close the bed
without unlocking it Therefore you see it is perfectly safe.
The bed is equipped with a first-class, comfortable spring
and there is plenty of room for bedding.
The wardrobe portion is very large and fitted with plenty of
hooks. In the door of the wardrobe is the large mirrorâ a
fine French bevel 18 by 40 inches, which is large enough to
reflect the full figure. In the bottom is a large drawer extend-
\ ing the full width of the piece.
One of the features of this furniture piece are the castors â
four 3-inch nickel-plated, easy running rollers, with polished
> face, so they will not wear the carpet.
Price for this piece complete, $50.00. Â¦

Professor Charles W. Pearson of the
chair of. English literature In the North
western University, which Is conducted
under Methodist auspices, has thrown a
bomb Into the ranks of Methodism, in
Bvanston, the seat of the university, by
giving out for publication a statement of
his belief that Biblical infallibility Is a
superstitious and hurtful tradition, and
that the Biblical stories of Christ** bring
ing the dead to life, of his walking on thÂ©
water-anil of feeding the multitude with
the' loaves and fishes, are.mere poetic
fancies, lncredltabls and untrue.
Professor Pearson declares that the
policy of the Methodist church Is one of
Inactivity, 1 obstruction and silence on the
views in which the- leaders and scholars
of the church have gradually become to
believe, but which are not held by the
body evasive.' He also says moet of the
Sunday-school teaching Is almost farcical
and entirely inadequate.
The decision affects the entire. Palomas
mining district, which lies north of New
hall.
While disputing over possession of the
land in 1SSS, armed forces of men under
William Chormicle and W. W. Jenkins
fought a battle, in which' two of the tat
ter's men were killed. Â¦ Chormicle and his
companions were tried but' were exoner
ated from the charge of -'willful killing,
the court finding that the Jenkins party
was organized for the sole purpose of
keeping its rivals oft the land. Â¦
The local land authorities have decided
that S. P. Rees.^W. "W. Jenkins and
Joseph.:, H... Wilbur have no legal
title to 5751.53 acres of land claimed
in the Palomas mining district, near Cas
taic, Los. Angeles County, prop^
erty will be turned over' to agricultural
claimants, of which William C. Chormicle
is the chief. Although the mineral claims
were taken up fifteen years ago, United
States officials find that no systematic de
velopment of the land has been conducted
and that there exists no proof that the
property contains either oil or minerals.

Too much credit cannot be given to the en
ergy, generosity and wisdom displayed by the
Miners' Union. It Immediately put up a small
hospital building and moved Its sick members
Into the place as soon as possible after they
were stricken. It secured the best nurses ob
tainable I to cafe for 'Â¦ the ' sick. The general'
manager 'of the Tonopah Company, Mr. Oddle,
was also very energetic and liberal In his do
nations to relieve the afflicted. It Is almost
unjust to mention one individual above ' an
other In this matter, for every one gave .of
his substance or time to aid the afflicted.
From the data that X was able to acquire
I have no hesitancy In saying that the disease
Is pneumonia Â¦ In character, but complicated
with congestion, of the liver in most cases
and gastric disturbances and weak hearts In
all of them. The disease Is similar In char
acter to that which prevailed In Hamilton.
Eureka and Floche in the late sixties and
early seventies and like that In 1878 and 1879.
After as thorough Investigation as was possible
In thirty-six hours I see no cause for panto
or to look upon the disease that existed In
Tonopah as one of a mysterious character.
That the mortality has been great is conceded,
but< no. more so than occurred In the towns I
have mentioned. The rate of mortality might
have been much less had the sick been better
housed. Lying, as moet of' them did. In tents,
a proper regulation of temperature could not
be obtained. The sanitary condition of the
town is bad and the water supply worse, both
of which could be almost perfectly corrected.
CARSON. Nev., Jan. 18.â Dr. 8. L. rÂ«Â«.
secretary of the State Board of Health,
who went to Tonopah mining camp to In
vestigate the pneumonia plague that has
claimed so many victims there, has sub
mitted his report to the Governor. Dr.
Lee says there; was nothing mysterious
about the epidemic, and attributes the
heavy mortality to the poor sanitation In
the camp and the fact that there were no
facilities for the proper care of the sick.
He aays In his report:'
Upon my arrival In Tonopah I found a. con
dition that amounted to panlo. An â¢pidemlo of
pneumonia, with complication!, brok* out on
thÂ« night of December 81, 1901. and "bÂ«tweÂ«a
that date and January 13 Â¦aventean deaths 00
curred. However, only thirteen- of thlÂ» num
ber died of the disease named. There wer*
twenty-six casea of an aggravated character.
In addition to this number there were thirty or
forty cases similar In character, but milder
In form, all of whom recovered.
Much difference of opinion existed In thÂ«
minds of the physicians resident as to' the
character of the disease and the cause of It.
All agree, however, that diseass of the lung*
existed with each and every case- It waa un
fortunate that only one autopsy was made.
Had more been performed a more perfect
knowledge of the pathology would have been
obtained.

an excellent Quality, similar to thÂ© white
sapphires "fduriaT'.ih" tne Togo" district,'
which are now shipped to London. ; j
Deo Insists that a prominent diamond
merchant of New York rendered an opin

been a really beautiful specimen of the
willow tree.
The fate of the tree naturally attracted
attention to the prenomenon, and there
after but too much opportunity was af
forded for the study of it At one point
in the river in particular the process was
seen. Green trees covered with rich
masses of foliage suddenly burst forth
Into conflagration and burned to their
very ' cores. Fine willows In full vl-or
poured 'forth clouds of smoke from their
half burned stems. - Â¦-[. ?Â¦"/?[
An examination of the charred remains
of the trees revealed nothing in the way
of explanation, but as the trees which
met their fates were for the most part
young there could. hardly have been any
putrescence or fermentation. v : ~y-.
Just why the willows should meet such
sudden ends is not apparent, but the oe
culiar formation of the tree, its pliant
boughs and the drooping of its leaves and
flower may. have had something to do

Wonderful Stone Bridge.
At Rockvllle,- a few miles from HarrU
burg, the capital of Pennsylvania, can be
seen a stone bridge that Is flve times
longer than any other stone bridge In the
world. It has Just been erected , by the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company, to, re
place an iron bridge of two tracks. The
new bridge contains four tracks and per
mits two passenger and two freight trains
to pass each other at the same time on
the bridge.'
This cannot be done on any other
bridge in the world. One ' end of this
bridge rests In Dauphin County and the
other end In Perry County. The Susque
hanna River flows under it all of the
time, and in stormy weather the muddy
waters of the Juniata often find their
way there also. There are forty-eight
piers and forty-eight arches. The bridge
is fifty feet wide and Is made of a light
colored stone, brought from Cambria
County. Fifteen quarries were kept busy
all of the time getting the stone out and
shipping it; there are l.OOO.TXK) cubic yards
of square stone iajthc bridge, and It cost
11,000,000. TBree hundred men worked oiv
It constantly from April 1, 1900, until the

While the report of the operation of the system is encouraging, thereV is no reason to
believe it can be made available in large cities for a- long time to come. Mr. Mansen, manager of
the New England Telephone Company, is reported; to have; said that the complication of the new
machinery in a large central office would be/so great as to render ' it impossible to suit sub
scribers. He stated further that in its present form the new system is not so economical as the
old. It is true it enables the telephone companiesto'dispense with the use of girls in the, central
office, and thus effects a saving, but in place 'of the girjs ; there is required the employment of
a number of highly skilled electricians to keep: the mechanism in working order, and their salaries
more than counterbalance the saving effected by the discharge of the girls.
Â¦ While these objections to the new system are valid at the- present time, their force
will diminish with each succeeding improvement in the switching apparatus. The Globe estimates
it will take ten years for the system to be carried to a degree of perfection that will make its
operation practicable in large cities. .... For about that length of time/ then, the "hello girl" may be
sure of her position. After that she must marry or hunt a new/job^ .
In giving an account of the Fall River experiments the Globe says: "Briefly, the working
of the automatic system is as follows: A metal dial is affixed^ to the telephone box. Then little
holes are cut in this dial. The holes are.numbered o to 9. With the receiver off the hook one
puts one's finger into a hole. The dial is jerked around until it catches. The dial swings on a pivot
and moves back into its place automatically. Thus; for the. number 1742 one inserts one's finger
into No. 1 hole, and for the other numbers twists the dial. As the .disk comes tack to its starting
point y .one presses a button just below. This rings the bell^t 'the otheoend/ and the connection is
made. If the other end is busy a buzzing sound announces the fact." \
WIRELESS telegraphy has been virtually attained, and now we are promised, where
the system is not too extensive, a practical means of telephoning without the use of
girls at the central station to make the switches. According to the Boston Globe
the new system has achieved its' greatest success in operation at Fall River, and the
test there is said to have proven to the world that it is practicable even when the service is of no
small limitation.

Taking a verse from Revelation as the
basis of computation some industrious and
probably uneasy fellow has again been
figuring on the dimensions of heaven.
The text Is in verse 15. chapter 21, and
reads as follows: "And he measured the
city with the' reed, 12,000 furlongs. The
length and the breadth and the, height of
It are equal." He concludes that thla
represents a space of 469,783.088,000,000,000;
000 cubic feet The enterprising statis
tician sets aside one half of this space
for the throne and the court of heaven,
and one-half of the balance for streets,
which would leave a remainder of 124,198.
272,000,000,000,000 cubic feet. He then pro
ceeds to. divide this by 4006, the number
of cubical feet in a room sixteen feet
square, and this process gives him 30,
821,843,750,000.000 rooms of tha size Indi
cated. He then proceeds upon the hypoth
esis that the world now contains, always
has contained, and will always contain,
$90,000,000 inhabitants, and that a genera
tion lasts for thirty-three and one-third:
years, which gives a total number of in
habitants every century of 2,297,000,000. H9
assumes -that the world will stand 1000
centuries or 100,000 years, which â¢ would!
give a total of 2,970,000,000,000 Inhabitants
for this period of time. He then reaches
the reassuring conclusion that If one hun
dred worlds of the same alza and dura
tion, and containing tha same number ofi
Inhabitants, should redeem, all the Inhab
itants there would bo more thai ona
hundred rooms of tha size Indicated for
each person. Men have not thought so
much about the size of heaven. They
have probably always felt that there
would be ample room for those who would
be able to get there. If a lack of room
were possible, In the divine order ofl
things, it would probably be at the other
place. Judging from thÂ© pronouncements
that are madÂ© from time to time. Room
has never been a matter of serious con
sideration with men who have paused long
enough in the whirl of events to meditate
on the blessing3 which are to follow a Ufa
of righteousness. The main question, and
the one in which all men are most con
cerned, Is the simple question of tha
shortest, best and safest way. Put in
different language, they want to kno\r
how to get there, and If tno studious
otatlsticlan will figure out ootao plan, that
will meet with general satisfaction along
this line he will probably smooth out tha

"Your Honor, please, and gentlemen of
the jury: A few years ago my only
brother fell wounded on the battlefield of
Gettysburg. Ho lay there bleeding to
death, with no friendly hand to help him.
Shot and shell, the fierce, fiery stream of
death were sweeping the earth about him.
No friend could go to him, no surgeon
dared approach him. The singing of bul
lets and the wild music of the shells was
to be his only requiem. My brother had a
body servant, a negro man, who waited
on him in camp. The negro saw his mas
ter's danger and straight out into the
sheet of battle and flame and death he
went. A cannon shot tore thÂ© flash from
his breast, but on he went, and, gathering
my brother In his arms, the blood of the
man mingling with the blood of the mas
ter, bore him to safety and life. Jim, open
your collar!"
And the jury saw on Jim's breast long,
jagged scars where the shell had ripped
Its way.
Continuing General' Toombs said: "Jim's
skin may bo blackâ he may bo a negro;
but the man who would do what Jim. did
for my brother has & soul too white ever
to have killed a man except in defense of
his own life." '*',
Jim was cleared.
â¢ It was General Robert Toombs of Geor
gia. Hla face was wrinkled some with
age, but It was large and strong, and the
lines of intellect made deeper wrinkles
than those of age. His hair was whitÂ©,,
but it rolled back in baby curls from the
most splendid brow that ever graced a
man. His form was tall and straight and
full sized, though his movements weje
slow with the years. His eyes still flashed
as when he stood in the Senate chamber
at Washington.
The case was tried. The witnesses all
seemed unfriendly toward the prisoner. In
bis own statement he claimed that the
killing was in self-defense.
General Toomba addressed the court and
jury at the last, and after fully discussing
the testimony of the eye-witnesses he con
cluded thus: . ' :
.'The following happened in Georgia In
the peace which followed the terrible war,
says the Columbus State. It illustrates
the love that so many of the old slaves
had for their masters and how that love
was shown: *
A negro man, strong and healthy, but
getting gray from years, was on trial in
one of the county Superior Courts for
murder. He had killed another negro and
had been lying in jail for some time,
awaiting his trial. The testimony against
him was given by other negroes who wit
nessed the killing. When the case was
called for trial by the presiding Judge an
old man rose and In a voice deep and low,
but full of marked gentleness, said: "Will
your Honor please mark me for the de
fense?" )

SAVING A HERO.
Speaking of voices, one may go far be
fore finding so pleasant a voice as that of
Louis James â clear, round and well-modu
lated. He reads with distinction, also,
and is always easily audible. Henry Aus
tin Clapp has an amusing anecdote of
Mr. James in the' November Atlantic
Monthly, by the way, concerning his im
personation of Cardinal "Wolsey, that we
have been privileged to see at the Colum
bia Theater this week. Says Mr. Clapp:
"Another case of professional misfit (he
had been speaking of Beerbohm Tree's
inefficient Falstaff) which worked lesa
serious results, and, indeed, made a re
markable display of ingenuity, appeared
during Miss Genevleve "Ward's last en
gagement In Boston. The play was 'Hen
ry VIII,' Miss Ward impersonating Queen
Katherine. Mr. Louis James, her lead
ing man, was cast for Cardinal Wolsey.
The Cardinal's part is long and hard to
learn and very likely was new to Mr.
James, whose position was onerous. He
One wonders if the sweet reasonableness
of Indianapolis will stop here. Or If the
leaven will penetrate the theatrical lump
and persuade the Indianapolis managerial
oracles that their subscribers also have a
right to hear that which they have paid
to "hear. 'Tis a sweet, too sweet, dream,
alas!
THE linels bisick alia gen." It la
unlikely that the ear of the lucky
subscriber of the , Indlanapoli3
Telephone Company will long be
affronted by such haplessly fami
liar Jargon as the above. This superhu
manly considerate corporation has ar
ranged to give lessons in elocution at its
own expense to Its operators, particular
ly to those concerned in the long distance
service. The^offlcials of the company,
with a brilliant disregard of corporate
conventions, acknowledge that clear
speech on the part of their operators is
a right of their subscribers, and have
taken this very practical method of in
suring It.' It now only remains for them,
to carry out the good work to its logical
conclusion, to set the wordwrights to
hammering the tongues of their subscrib
ers Into intelligibility, and when that is
done we can give them a life Job here.
But it is a curious commentary, on the
national school system that one. of the
first essentials to gentle living, clear and
musical speech, the right use of the voice,
is all but entirely neglected in its curri
culum. Here are young women, presum
ably all with a good common school edu
cation, unable to use their own "tongue
with sufficient clearness to be understood
at the other end of a telephone wire.
They have, in very truth, to be taught
how to speak, and all honor to the corpo
ration that has grasped the situation so
effectively.

Mme. Sanderson could sing once, for
there is still strong evidence of her former
power to please, though the voice has
never been a great one. Of lts ; prese'ut
lack enough has been said, but everything
else the singer has in lavish measureâ as
has also been said before. She has Im
mense chic, style, presence and physical
beauty. She is spirituelle, intelligent and
is an actress of charm, temperament and
distinction. But all these things do not
make a grand opera singer, where the
sine qua non is a voice, and I contend that
San Francisco was well within its rights
in so saying.
it Is a choice between the two. But tastes
differ. The truth is, as Mr. Huneker
puts it, that Mme. Sanderson's Bln^lnsr
days are. over, unless by some altogether
to bo wished for miracle -she should re
cover her voice. It Is a tragedy of tha
saddest, it is true, and the path of tlie
artist is strewn with such. But art is
pitiless, forgetful of former victory and
blind to the bleeding feet that fail, to-day
to reach her ehjning summits. She knows
only the bloom and fruitage of her ser
vants' tears; so only may she preserve
her integrity, and the artist is but food
for her infinite passion for perfection.
PERSONAL MENTION.
Mme. Sanderson further flatteringly
complains of the suddenly Important
critics of San Francisco that they said she
was nervous on her first appearance. And
she wasn't So there! I have yet to learn
that nervousness is a crime, and should
fancy that a. singer would better like to
be called nervous than Incompetent, when
As to "Manon," with its two airs,
finirjry fineness, bodiless score and cheap,
libidinous atmosphere, we are In neither
musical nor moral danger in being unable
to appreciate its peculiarly Gallic excel
lencies, and can plead guilty to not liking
It with light heart, I do not remember
that Mine. Sanderson was accused here
of being "too Frenchy" in the role of
Manon. though possibly the respected
critic of the Milpitas "Bran. Mash" came
tip on the milk train that night and was
startled Into some such absurdity of ex
pression. But we do not count him In
here, and should hardly be held accounta
ble for his sins. As to the "Home, Sweet
Home" Incidentâ The Call correspondent
stating that Mme. Sanderson was re
quested by some local Jester to sing the
said song during the progress of the opera
âa la Melbaâ it can only be said that the
singer was wise in refusing to win a pass-
Ing appreciation from "some of the audi
ence" by bringing the quaint old melody
into so unworthy company.
DID not a characteristic modesty
forbid. I could, and I would, ad
vance a valid claim to a humble
share in the sudden and start
ling critical eminence recently
attained by San Francisco. Sybil San
derson has been "saying things" about us
in London, to The Call correspondent who
interviewed the singer about her Ameri
can tour. Mme. Sanderson reports herself
as hichly pleased with the tour as a
whole, but has decided among other
things that the American intellect. is as
yet insufficiently capacious to take In the
vast significances of Massenet's "Manon,"
the opera that had the honor to be built
around the varied charms of the fair
Callfornian. But It is not the collective
American opinion that seems to count
with the singer in this or any other re
gard, and here is where we come in. It
is the opinion of San Francisco, the Ish
mael among cities, the heretofore despised
end rejected of the criticized, that alone
appears to have achieved the dignity of
attention or comment from Mme. Sander
son. It matters not at all that James
Huneker, possibly the most distinguished
musical critic in America, should say in
the Musical Courier of January 1, in
speaking of her performance of Juliet at
the Metropolitan Opera-house: "She is a
charming woman of the Phiyne, Thais,
Esclarmonde type, not the type of Juliet,
though her singing days are over. Of that
sad fact there can be little doubt." But
when the same criticism is made in San
Francisco It bounds at once into the place
of consideration, and compels .the singer
to reprisal even from fax London town.
"We are certainly arriving.

daily expect to hear of this enterprise (the Panama canal) being undertaken by private enter
prise, in which case the grander cosmopolitan project of a ship communication would be super
seded and indefinitely postponed, and special privileges secured to some minor private interests,
for doubtless half a century ; hostile to the interest of the world at large. The duty is peculiarly
incumbent on the United States to take the initiative in this work. Our position as the first of
the American republics and the principal national interest and power in the Western Hemisphere
â our own experience of the results of the stimulus and development of national resources by
the creation of similar facilities of national intercourse (referring to the Erie canal) seem to point
peculiarly to the United States as equally entitled to the glory of the undertaking and respon
sible to the world for its accomplishment. We are already in possession of a sufficient basis of
facts to justify an initiatory proceeding,' and we trust that the next Congress will j not adjourn
without providing a liberal appropriation for the purpose. . It would be enthusiastically sus
tained by public opinion, and would reflect unfading honor on the administration under whose
auspices so grand and glorious an undertaking should be commenced."
Radcliffe in his exhaustive report iaid the Chagres River is navigable at all seasons* to a
point forty miles from its mouth, to the town of Cruces, or within fifteen miles of the Pacific coast.
. . Lloyd's report to the Royal Society in 1831 says: "The great chain of mountains is broken
at the spot where the continent of Amerira is reduced to its narrowest limits, 'between Chagres
on the Atlantic side and Chorrea on the Pacific side."
Another consideration of prime importance is *the fact that if, we take the canal at the price
offered by the French company, it carries with it 68,000 out of the 70,000 shares of the Panama
Railroad, and- the control of that most important means of transportation and defense. The rail
road almost parallels the canal; and its use in the further work of construction is of the greatest
economical value. It will be also an important factor in the defense of the work when finished. We
are all aware of the importance of operating a telegraph line alongside , of a railroad. , The con
tiguity of a railroad and the isthmian canal is of more importance. This Panama project was cher
ished by General Simon Bolivar and by his successor, President Santander. '
A report made to Congress in 1836 en the subject says that the Panama route is preferable
on account of its shortness. ; . :,
The machinery for the work of construction is on the ground. There is a perfect equipment
of hospitals, machine shops, officers' buildings and. everything needed, in readiness to go on with
the work. If our Government acquire all this we will get a canal many. years sooner than would
be possible by the Nicaragua route. * \ ; ; : \_
The* franchises, concessions^ control and all other issues pertaining to the Panama route
are adjusted. Every question pertaining to it. is settled: .Every right is in assignable form. The
engineering problems- are all solved and the most difficult part of the work is finished. Only the
single sovereignty of Colombia has to be dealt with; and there are no treaty complications with
any other foreign power. â¢ â¢ ' ' . ;
MORE than a year ago The Call predicted that the Panama canal 1 would come. to
the front, offering to the promoters of an isthmian 7 canal a plain way out of the com
plications which were due to the inventive genius of the opponents of any canal. The
Nicaragua route has offered a splendid opportunity for opposition to ambush behind
everything, from pelf to patriotism. It traverses the two independent sovereignties of Nicaragua
and Costa Rica, and was complicated further by our treaty relations with Great. Britain. As it used
Lake Nicaragua for a considerable distance, there arose also' tfie issue of treating its extensive
shores as the bank of the canal, and altogether the complex questions presented were just to the
hand of men who desired to defeat the project by pretending great solicitude about the large
number of collateral matters.'

At evening dinner I had been taught
by experience that I must refrain from

Â¦red that this charming beverage was
1'ostum rood Coffee, and that the family
had been greatly benefited by. leaving off

on an indictment found against her in
1897, charging use of 1 the ', mails in a

The Indictment alleges that Mrs. Yateii
opened a correspondence with Mrs. Cor

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Jan. 18.â If the

J. H. Wood [writes to the Mining and
Scientific Press concerning the use of oil
for fuel In the mines of Arizona, whicfi
grew out of the high charges for coke,
amounting to $21 at a smelter south of
Bisbee, owing to the high transportation
rates. The coke was then selling at the
ovens in Colorado at. $3 50. Mr. Wood
writes that the almost prohibitive cost of
using coke was not the only disadvan
tage. There were times when the manu
facturers could not fill the orders for the
mines; times when cars were delayed on
the way from Colorado; times when
freighting teams .were scarce and also
when the freighting teams were stalled
en route. There were reasons ln view for
the demand that has since been made
for the products of the California petrol
eum miners. Some, of the uses to "which
California oil are now put for the facili
tation of â¢ mining in Arizona are re
counted.. , .
Cheap. and Handy Fuel.
At the Congress mine crude oil has been used
for years in the roasters. , At that mine the
non-shipping ore is crushed/plated and con
centrated. But as all the values cannot be
extracted by this process the tailings are
roasted in the oil fuel furnaces before cyanid
ing. In thin operation the tailings are car
ried, ln endless chain buckets. through n
scrips of furnaces or fire boxes, in which the
fire consists Â¦ solely of burning oil.
A.iother important step forward has just
been > taken ! at Globe. Ariz., where the Old
Dominion Copper Company, after a month's
trial announces that the experiment of using'
fuel oil. in smelters has been successful. This
test has demonstrated that oil Is cheaper than
wood or coal and can be used with entire sat
isfaction in smelting work. The use of oil
as fuel is to be expanded at the Old Dominion
plant so as to extend to the boilers at UrÂ»
mines. To carry out this plan the company
will erect storage tanks of 200.000 gallons
capacity, and construct a pipe line to convey
oil from the smelter to the mines. Only those
who have thÂ» practical ' management ! of, Ari
zona mines on their* hands can_ fully appre
ciate the difference in results which will follow
the , general introduction of oil as a cheaper
substitute fuel for- wood, coke and coal. Â¦
Reverting to the Congress I mine. It I should
not be forgotten that the standard gauge steam
railway engines ln use on the Congress railway,
cperating between Congress Junction and Con
gress, use crude oil as. fuel under their boil
ers. .In this case, too, the operation la emi
nently successful. The experiments above
cited I Involve - only the use of - crude oil, but
other tests have been . going â¢ on with better
quality oil. .. One in particular was conducted
with a view to ascertaining whether crude dis
tillate rouUl be used a3 the motive power in
gas anil ga.toline engines, instead of cither gas
or- high grade gasoline, at the suggestion of
an Arizona -operator who l'ound steam plants
unsuitable for his operations. In order to make
the test on a large and practical scale. â¢ a
carload of 45 degrees distillate was shipped
from the Puentc, Cal.,' refinery to the engine
manufacturing company's factory. , The out
come of tliis test was the erection of distillate
engines capable of running almost -any kind of

INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 18.-Several hun
dred delegates have already arrived here
to . attend the thirteenth annual conven
tion of the United- Mine Workers of
America, which opens- Monday morning.
Fear is expressed that the convention
will be unwieldy, as it is believed there
will be over 1000 delegates, making 'it the
largest convention ever held by organized
labor. President Mitchell will preside.
Ben Tillett, the famous English labor
leader, will arrive to-night to be the guest
of the miners until Thursday. President
Gompers of the American Federation of
Labor also may visit the city.
It is understood that the miners will
present a demand for an increase of at
least 10 per cent over the wages they how
receive, but it is almost equally certain
that the operators will make a stubborn
resistance, as many of them claim they
are either operating at a loss or at a
very small profit. The miners also will
ask for an extension of the run of the
mine clause to the districts where the
screen basis now prevails. This has been
in controversy for a long time and will
be an important feature of the conven
tion. An agreement which now exists as
to wages was made here two years ago
and ratified at the joint conference at
Columbus last year.
The fact that the miners have failed to
unionize West Virginia may prevent them
from getting an increase at present
time, as the operators of Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Indiana and Illinois claim that the
West Virginia operators, who pay non
union wages, are enabled to undersell
them. The situation ln West Virginia
will probably receive considerable atten
tion, as the miners are determined to
unionize the State. <j
President Mitchell, Vice President
Lewis and Secretary-Treasurer Wilson
will undoubtedly be rc-elecled without op
position. The national executive board
of the miners meet here to-day to take
up grievances that will be presented to
the committee. y .

The Mining and Scientific Press ex
presses the opinion that gold mines will
be particularly favored" by Investors dur
ing the year 1902. . There will be a de
mand for other properties, says the Press,
but gold is the style. Whether the pre
dictions of the Press are verified or not
before the current twelve . months are
brought to an end, the gold miners will
agree to the following statements:
The success of one gold miner or one set
of gold miners does not mean a possible loss
to other gold miners. . On tha contrary it means
an added gain to the others and a new gold
field opened for other gold miners. Their in
coming cannot make an overproduction', no
matter how much more production they may
make.
There has been at time9 a suggestion that
the gold mines of the world would be gathered
into- one great combination or trust. The
possibility need inspire no fears for lessened
profit in the industry." Independence la pos
sible with sold mining', as it is possible with
no other kind of. metal mining. It Is not
necessary to make a market for the metal ;
It Is not even necessary that It should be
coined to be exchangeable. While a monopoly
of gold is conceivable It is not seriously con
ceivable as being effected through the mining
of ail the gold from the mines. The people
who would make such a monopoly Would get
the gold after it is mined with less risk.

But Passengers Escape
Injury.
Coache3 Thrown From Rails
VICTOR, la., Jan. 18.â As the Denver
limited passenger train No. 5, 'on l the
Rock Island line, was passing through
town this morning at 5:55 the boiler of
engine No. 503 exploded, causing the
death of the engineer and fireman and
rlightly injuring twoiporters and a brake
man. The killed are:
â¢ W. WILLIAMS of Brooklyn, engineer.
E. HOAR of Valley Junction, fireman
The accident took place within 250 feet
of the depot and the noise of the"Â» ex
plosion aroused the town. The force of
the ' explosion threw every one of . the
seven coaches of the train from the track,
but only overturned the Des Moines Pull
man. The passengers were uninjured.
Pieces of the wrecked engine were strewn
round for a distance of 200 feet and the
boiler was found 150 feet" away from 'the
scene of the accident.
The cause of the explosion will never
be known, owing to the death of the
engineer and fireman. Superintendent
Lawrence of this division arrived in, a
special at 8 o'clock from Des Moines and
immediately proceeded to clear away the
debris. He refused to make any state
ment with rcg-ard to -the accident. The
bodies of the' engineer and fireman were
mangled and were found only a short dis
tance away.
Train No. 5 does not stop at Victor. This
morning the limited passed through the
village at a speed of forty miles an hour.
Th'ree hundred feet west of the station
begins a slight down grade, which extends
a mile to Carnforth, where the Rock
Island crosses Bar Creek. The accident
occurred on this grade and it is suggested
that Williams had decided to let out his
engine for a burst of speed, during which
the accident occurred.
Williams, the dead engineer, had been
in the service of the Rock Island Com
pany for twenty-eight years and was re
garded as? one of, the ablest in the em
ployment of the company. This morn
ing's run was not his regular one, he
having taken it to accommodate' a brother
engineer. For years he was stationed at
Stuart, Iowa, but in 1897 he moved to
Rock Island, III.

A Simple Internal Remedy Makes
Remarkable Cures of Catarrh.
People who have used spraya, Inhaters, salves
and washes for catarrh and have found how
useless and Inconvenient they are, will J be
agreeably surprised at results following the
use of a pleasant . Internal remedy ln tablet
form; druggists everywhere admit that Stuart's
Catarrh TableU, which they sell at 50 cents
for full sized treatment, la the safest, most ef-
fective and popular of all catarrh remedies.
Nearly all cheap cough mixtures and throat
lozenges contain opiates; these cheap medicines
give a temporary relief, especially with little
children, by destroying nerve sensation; the Ir-
ritation In throat, which , causes coughing-. J U
temporarily removed, , not â¢ by removing thts
cause, but by deadening the nerves of reeling.
The irritation 1b ; not felt,; although it la still
there and will promptly return.
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets Is the best remedy
to remove catarrhal secretion, whether in the
nose, throat or stomach, because they are com-
posed of wholesome antiseptics like Bed Gum,
Blood Root, etc.; when you use these tabtets
i you know what you are putting into your sys-
tem, and not taking chances with cocaine,
opla'tes or\ similar polsonst found In' so many,
catarrh cures and cough medicines. , j
Dr. BamBdell ln commenting on catarrh cures
eays : "I can heartily recommend Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets, because ; they contain S no | co-
caine nor other dangerous drug found ln so
many advertised catarrh cures. I have known
of many cases. of long standing catarrh of the
head and throat completely cured by the daily
use of these tablets for several 1 weeks. One
case in particular, which. I could not reach
with an Inhaler or Bpray and where the catarrh
caused dally headaches and a noticeable loss of
hearing, was entirely cured by this harmless
but effective remedy. '. ' Â¦ ;
,, Dr. Walnwright says: "I never hesitate to
nrescribe Stuart's Catarrh Tablets for catarrhal
headaches and j catarrhal deafness | because . I
know them to be ! perfectly safe for child or
adult and have seen many; remarkable cures
resulting from their regular dally, use; because
they i ore advertised and sold in drug stores
Is no" reason why any good physician should not
use - them, because we should seize upon the
means of cure wherever found."-. . ...,;,_ -
Â¦ Â¦Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are especially valu-
able for ,Â¦Â¦ catarrhal colds in , children because
they are pleasant to the taste and may be used
rreely to break up severe colds and croup at
the very beginning. " â¢â¢ . Â¦ - ; .--, ,.Â¦?.,,,

ney James D. Pilcher has telegraphed
Chief of Police J. J. Donahue of Omaha
that Edwin V. Wilber, who is held a pris

and forgery, may^be Pat Crowe,' who is
charged with having been one of the kid
napers of the Cudahy boy. The age, com
plexion and height of Wilber tally with
Donahue's description of Crowe. It Is also
known that Wilber was associated here
with a person of the identical : description
of the man Donahue described as "No. 2."
Upon close examination of the suspect
under arrest here giving the name of Wil
ber it was discovered that the. exact
marks of identification . that distinguish
Pat Crowe are prominent on the man, and
the officers are firmly convinced they,
have the notorious kidnaper In jail.
The sprinkling of gray . hair with the
brown on the sides of his head, the miss
ing molar teeth and the scars on the left
thumb and index flnger tally accurately
with Crowe's description.". : . " â¢

LONDON, Jan. 18.â The Lord Chief Jus
tice, Baron Alverstone, to-day sustained
the contention of the defense of Dr.
Krause, that the charges of Inciting to
murder must fail, as mere was no evi
dence that the letters in the case had
reached Broecksman; but held that the
question .of "attempting to persuade"
must go to the jury.
Dr. Krause was found guilty and sen
tenced to two years' imprisonment. .
Before he was sentenced. Dr. Krause
protested that he never intended to mur
der any one.
The Lord Chief Justice, in passing sen
tence, declared- the offense was morally
as great as though the crime had been
carried out. The prisoner, the court said,
did everything he could to insure murder
being committed, and f.ie maximum sen
tence was therefore imposed. Â¦
Dr. Krause, former Governor of Johan
nesburg, was charged with inciting Cor

' The friends of the tariff bill continue to
express themselves in pessimistic terms
regarding the prospects of that measure.
It is significant that the Agrarian organ,
the Deutsche Tages Zeltung, has printed
an article notifying the tariff committee
that there is no use wasting time upon
the bill unless the agricultural duties are
raised still higher, as the agricultural
members will never vote for the bill in
its present form. More sober papers
friendly to the bill are. also much dis
couraged on account of the slow progress
it is making in committee. -

BERLIN, Jan. 18.â The action of Em
perorl William in sitting through a long
lecture by Professor Delltzsch, "the As
syrlolo&Ist, on .the "Babylonish Origin ol
Hebrew Ideas" has alarmed | the ultra
orthodox circles of the sta^e church, who
begin to think something is wrong with
his Majesty's theology.
They have- noted that in Gotha thre*
weeks ago the Emperor Intimated tnat
all churches' were equally dear to him,
sayfng that one of the great purposes ol
his life was to bring about church. unity.
His allowing Professor Delitzsch's' con
clusions as to the historical foundation
of Hebrewism to have imperial approval
is regarded as a dangerous symptom.
Professor Delitzsch at tne termination
or his address thanked Emperor William
for his countenance and large personal
contribution, enabling researches to be
made in the territory of ancient Baby

no standing in court. The court- reversed
itself upon the showing made by Attor
neys Francis J. Ilehey and William F.

gument being that certain representations
made to the latÂ« Frank P. Wickersham of
Fresno, whereby he was induced to re
nounce his right to both his father's and
mother's estates Â¦Â¦ loi the sum of $23,000.
were not based upon fact. Another point
involved was that in signing away his In

Wlckershara was disposing of something
that existed only as an expectancy.

negie will be made a party to a
suit for property valued at $2,000,

thÂ« wife of Ms brother by heirs
of Robert Stafford, the Sea Island cotton

tion havÂ« Just been prepared In this city.
The suit will be to secure title to Cum
berland Island, off the coast of Georgia,

He had $200 at that time and went to the
Island to raise cotton. In the second
year of his work there he was married.
His wife was Elizabeth Barnaby, famed

by a Georgia planter and her ancestors
were white, bat she had been. sold Into
slavery and an action was pending at the
time to secure her freedom. Robert Staf
ford fell in love with her, purchased her
freedom and made her his wife. It is the
descendants of this woman and Robert
Stafford â¢who are now contending for the
$2,000,000.
Robert Stafford died in New London,

lour daughtersâ Mrs. Mary Palmer, wife
of Dr. Palmer of New London; Ada,
Countess Zivulkl of Paris; Mrs. Madora

Rheumatic pains nrc the cries of protest
and distress from tortured muscles, aching
joints and exdted nerves. The blood has
been poisoned by the accumulation of
waste matter in the system, and can no
longer supply the pure and health sustain-
ing food they require. The whole system
feels the effect of this acid poison ; and
not until the blood has been purified and
brought back to a healthy condition will
the aches and pains cease.
Mrs. James Kell, of 707 Kinth street, N. E.,
Washington, D. C, writes as follows: "A few
months ago I had an attack of Sciatic Rheuma-
tism in its worst form. The
pain was so intense that I
became completely pros- Â¦
trated. The attack was an
unusually severe one, and WY
my condition was regard- flf i.-jWw
ed as being very danger- W^Hv
ous. I was attended by â¢ v. V/a Â£j$sA
one of the most able doc- J^ lsÂ» 'iSiwy'
tors in "Washington, who is a^jgB^CdWKF-'
also a member of the fac-
ulty of a leading medical tm&a&'^&Mf^Ummft
college here. He told me! wmGa&BSaXUBxb
to continue his prescrip-' . â¢ - -,
tionsand I would get well. After having it filled
twelve times without receiying the slightest ,
benefit, I declined to continue his treatment any
longer. Having heard of S. S. S.(Swif fs Specific) i
recommended for Rheumatism, I decided, almost
in despair however, to give the medicine a trial.
and after I had taken* few bottles I was able to ;
hobble around on crutches, and very soon there- !
after had no use for them at all, S. S. 6. having
cured me s=und and well. All the distressing '
pains have left tat, ray appetite has returned, i
and I am happy to be again restored to perfect
health. .Â¦ . : . 1

Shroff, according to the description
given the police by his late cu3todlans
at Alcatraz, is 26 years old, 5 feet V> f 2
inches tall, has brown eyes, is of
r uddy complexion and wore a bro-srn
mustache. He was dressed in regulation
blue pantaloons and shirt.
Shroff has served two years of his sen
tence. He was a trusty and took advan
tage of the comparative freedom his
duties gave him to escape. Lieutenant
Lloyd, wfio^was officer of the day and as
such was responsible for the safe cus
tody of the prisoners, was also in charge
when Frank H. Holt escaped in a dry
goods box.
Cordlnelli took the half-drowned man
to his house, supplied him with dry un
derwear, gave him breakfast and lent
him half a dollar. Shroff then disap
peared, and the police,, who were notified
of the escape by the military authorities,
have so far been unable to locate him.
Abel J. Shroff, a military prisoner
serving a three-year sentence for a crime
cpmmitted In the Philippines, escaped
yesterday from Alcatraz Island on a
plank. He was picked up at 6 o'clock
in the morning by two fishermen. Paul
Cordineli and Antonio Alilo, to whom he
told a story of a. hunting trip spollc-d by
the capsizing of his skiff.
The skiff had disappeared, he said, and
but for. the providential presence In bis
vicinity of a plank. he would surely have
drowned. He was capsized, he said, at 2
a. m. and was just about to let go the
plank when the fishermen sighted him.
He told his rescuers that he lived in Sau
salito and that his- name was Frank Pen
nell.

The following named clergymen will be
in attendance:
Those Who Will Attend.
The trouble In St. Paul's Church be
tween certain of the members of the
congregation and the rector is expected
to come up on appeal, though -parish re
bellions, as a rule, get but scant cour
tesy In diocesan conventions. /There are,
it is said, complaints as to the manage
ment of the orphan asylum at San Ma
teo, and of the boys' home in this city,
charges of extravagance and fruitlessness
of results being , made, which may be
brought to the notice of the convention.
At all events, the coming council and the
possible results of its consultations are
regarded with some dread by conserva
tive churchmen, who fear that conten
tion may arise over some of the numer
ous and burning questions there are to
be discussed.
Father Parrish heads the movement to
oust Van Bokkelin and ls reported to
have strong support.
There are rumors that a fight is to be
made against the present treasurer of the
diocese, who is said to be objectionable to
a large number of the clergy of the Jur
isdiction. The organ of the diocese, in its>
last issue, referred to the treasurer as an
"ecclesiastical bully," with an inclina
tion to run things to suit himself.
Fight Against Treasurer.
The movement of the low church ele
ment of the diocese inaugurated by.W.'
A. M. Van Bokkelin, diocesan treasurer,
is likely to-. occasion a good deal of trou
ble and require all the authority of the
Bishop to prevent it becoming a scandal
to all good churchmen. The churches
where extreme ritual is practiced are the
Advent and St. Mary's of San Francisco
and St. John's of Oakland, with imita
tions in several other parishes and sym
pathizers, now in the minority, but as a
body rapidly growing, which are to be
found in every parish in the diocese. The
"broad" churchmen art> looking in
may at the rapid progress of the ."high"
church element In the diocese. It is a
cause of complaint that all the new ttteo
logians of the San Mateo Seminary are
infected with the advanced idea. 1 The
Bishop belongs to no school, but, it is
said, makes no attempt to discourage any
of the practices of the ultra ritualistic
churches. Both parties to the contro
versy are preparing for the fray and live
ly discussions a're predicted.
Low Church Element.
The annual convention of the. Episco
palian Diocese of California, which meets
in. St. John's Church, San Francisco, on
AVednesday morning, January 28, promises
to be the largest in poirtt of attendance
and ihe most Interesting. of all that have
met ln the fifty-nine years In which the
diocese has been organized as an inde
pendent province of the church'. Antici
pations of conflict" between the various
schools of thought in the church are rife,
and there are rumors that certain individ
uals, charged wtih being too "autocratic
and outspoken in their, relations to the
clergy, are to. be disciplined, if not re
lieved of their functions altogether. V .
The diocesan board of missions, which
has direction of the missionary work of
the church, is criticized for its sensa
tional relinquishment of the bounty from
the general board, whereby a large finan
cial responsibility has been added to the
heavy burdens of the diocese ' without a
corresponding benefit resulting from the
action.
There is considerable criticism in cer
tain quarters in regard to the large sal
ary paid to the Venerable Archdeacon
Emery. Too much money, it ls said, is
wasted In salaries for, oversight, while the
compensation of the hard-worked mis
sionaries is reduced to a bare living. De
mands- are increasing for more churches
and stations in the outside communities
of the diocese, which . cannot, â¢ it is
claimed, be met while such extravagant
amounts are expended for doubtful enter
prises engaged in by, the church.

Jjk CATARRH
i3$r Croup
That coughs, catarrh, croup, bronchitis,
pneumonia anri consumption are caused
solely by germs is now admitted by ev-
ery honest med!cal man. that these .
germs are located' in the air passages and J
cannot be destroyed excepting by direct j
application cannot be denied.
That HYOMEI ls the only germicide of i
sufficient power to destroy these gfenns
and the only one which can be Inhaled
is positively proven by the reports of the j
Bureau of .Vital Statistics in Washing-
ton, which show that this remedy has- re-
duced the death rate from these diseases '
34 per cent ln one year. And by a recent
editorial in the, United States Health
Reports, which says that this reduction
is due to the use of HYOilEI alone, and
that no other remedy or treatment had
anything whatever to do with It.
COUGHS of any description cannot
exist after the germs causing the same
are killed.
By' breathing HTOMEI for a few mln-
utes daily you destroy these germs com-
pletely.
CROUP germs disappear within 20
minutes after the first Inhalation of HT-
OMEI is taken.
ORDINARY COUGHS are cured la
twenty-four hours.
BRONCHITIS. In from one to six
days.
CATARRH and CONSUMPTION
germs are eradicated in from two to six
weeks.
. If you doubt this, send to The R. T. Booth
Co., Ithaca. N. Y.. for a five days' treatment
free. - If you haven't time to do so, ask your

Ephraim W. Mentzer executors to-rloy
entered suit In the Blair County Court
against the Pennsylvania Railroad Com
pany to recover the sum of $768,000. The
late Mentzer was a Â¦ coal operator and
shipper.. It Is alleged that during - the
years 18S0 and 1859 the railroad company
granted many secret rebates and draw
backs to, Mentzer's competitors in the
coal business, to his financial, detriment.
The plaintiffs claim that they only recent

urer. A plan of service was submitted
and indorsed and the delegates were in
structed to report to their, respective
groves to ascertain if It will meet with
their approval. It was also decided to
ask the circles of the Order- of Druldesses,

Many natural obstacles must be over

The Atchison is in much the same po
sition, and not to be outdone by its neigh
bors this company has outlined plans for
extensions and betterments that will cost
$25,000,000. From $15,000,000 to $20,000,000, it

Rebellion in Country Said to Have

:. > by Guerrillas.
. COLON, Jan. 18.â Advices received here
to-day announce that 1 the Government
troops at Panama are ready to depart by
steamers for the coast to attack the In
surgents. News was received at Panama
thaV insurgent forces had embarked on
their own vess'els and that their destina
tion was unknown. ' .
NEW YORK, Jan. 18.- Dr. Antonio Jose
Cavlvid. private secretary of President
Marroquin of Columbia, and General
Manuel Maria Mallarino, ex-Minister of
War, have arrived . here from Panama.
. Their mission, It is said, Is to 'dispose of
the Government emerald' mines at Muza,
a department of Boyaca. ' -.
At present the Colombian Government
is said to receive a monthly rental cf
$36,000 for the use of the mines, but the
financial stagnation' of .the country and
the expense of maintaining a large army,
make it necessary for them to sell some
of them outright. Regarding the Insurrec
tion. General Mallarino said:
"The rebellion has narrowed uown to
operations by a few scattered bands of
guerrillas, tavho, I: am sure, will soon be
suppressed./
Ohio River railroads are below the stand
ard of efficiency required to make them
profitable adjuncts of the parent system,
and It is not unlikely that bonds will be
Issued to cover the cost of v needed'im
provements. u Altogether it is probable
t hat the Baltimore j and Ohio will expend
Â§25,000,000 this year in -perfecting Its ma
chinery. ' -

quired to perform the various feats. Some
of the most proficient members of. the
Burlingame Country Club are expected
to participate in the coming event. The
contest for Saturday afternoon will be
especially Interesting, as Manager Alonro
has arranged a programme that includes
only the champions of the game. This
sport is one of the most exciting .ball
games. It has held sway for centuries In
the Basque provinces and is popular with
the people of the Iberian* peninsulas. In
United States Consul General John K.
Gowdy paid a tribute to the late,Presi
dent McKinley. He pointed out that the
confidence in President Roosevelt is -so
great that the onward march of pros
perity has never slackened. "President
Roosevelt's "patriotism and stanch prin
ciples," declared Gowdy, "will continue
to bear us on the great wave of pros
perity."
Alluding to the Franco-American com
mercial treaty President Kimbel ex
pressed regret that its advantages were
not yet sufficiently understood in the
United States, adding that he was con
vinced Its needs would shortly-become
imperatively felt. The year's report of
the chamber testified to its flourishing
condition. Its increased membership and
work necessitated " extensive quarters,
which. It Is expected, will be further .In
creased in the near future. Regret was
expressed that the United States Con
gress had not established the metric sys
tem. The chamber is convinced that the
adoption of this system will further de
velop foreign commerce with the United
States.
PARIS, Jan. 18.â Patriotic sentiment and
warm sympathy with France were the
keynotes of to-night's annual banquet

This information was conveyed to
United States District Attorney Marshall
13. Woodworth yesterday In a letter from
the Secretary to Mr. Woodworth. The
bondsmen resisted the payment of the
whole amount claimed because one of the
' bondsmen, James Doujjherty, had died
i some time before the defalcations oc
curred and no one had been substituted
in his place. Former United States Dis
trict Attorney Henry S. Koote, not hav
ing been informed of the death of Mr.
Dougherty, certified to the State Depart
ment that Dougherty was yet living and
he was continued on the bond. Judgment
was recovered against the bondsmen for
J40.1S0, and interest then . began to run
against that amount. A few months ago
the bondsmen offered to compromise for
$42,000. but the offer was rejected and
they were obliged to pay the full' judg
ment and Interest, amounting to $47,506 82.
The proceedings against the bondsmen
were inaugurated and brought to a suc
cessful termination by Marshall B. "Wood
worth. United States District Attorney
for the northern district of California.
The bondsmen of ex-Internal Revenue
Collector Osca M. Welburn have paid
into the United States treasury the sura
cf $47,506 S2, the amount for which they

STRANGE MENTAL POWERS
How People Are Influenced.
Startling Words From , th? Committee Appointed to In-
vestigate Hypnotism for the Benefit "i
of the Public.
G. S. LINCOLN. M.D.. ' JUDGE HENRY SCHAFER,
101 Crutchfield St.. Dallas. Tex. Fleminjrton. N. J.
F. H. STOUFER. Secretary and Treas- HEV. PAUL WELLER.
urer cf Railway Conductors. Pueblo. Colo. . Gorham. N. Y.
Hypnotism is no longer a myth, a fanciful creation of the mind, but a real-
ity, a most potent power, capable of producing infinite good. For the purpose of
ascertaining the exact value of this much-talked-of power a committee composed
of a physician, a well known Jurist, a prominent minister and a leading railroad
man was appointed to Investigate Hypnotism.
The committee carried on a series of investigations in regard to the power of
hypnotism to influence the actions and deeds of people in the everyday walks
of life.
The first step taken by the members of the committee was to master the
science in every detail so that they might state from personal experience the
good or evil this strange power might produce. They wrote the New York Insti-
tute of Science of Rochester, N. Y., the greatest school of Hypnotism and Occult
Science In the world, and received full and complete Instructions in regard to
how hypnotism may be used to Influence people in business, how to use it Jn
treating diseases, &c, &c. In a few days they mastered these instructions anil
were full-fledged hypnotists. ; \
It was clearly demonstrated that hypnotism may be employed so that the :
person operated upon Is entirely unconscious of the fact that he Is being in-
fluenped; and, all things considered, the committee regards It as the most valu-
able discovery of modern times. A knowledge of it is essential to o'ne's success
in life and well-being in society.
Dr. Lincoln says, after a thorough Investigation, that he considers it the most
marvelous therapeutic or curative agent of modern times.
Judge Schafer, although jl legal light, turned his attention to healing the
6ick, and In a few treatments he completely cured Jotw E. Myers of Fleming-
ton, N. J., of a strange malady- that had kept him bedfast for nine years, and
which the doctors said must surely kill him. " Judge Schafer's fame .spread for
miles around and hundreds of people applied to him for treatment.
Mr. Stoufer performed the astonishing feat of hypnotizing Mr. Cunningham
of Pueblo, Colo., at a distance of several blocks. He also hypnotized an. aged
gentleman and had him run through the streets shouting, "Redhot peanuts for
sale." Mr. Stoufer says It Is indispensable to one's business success.'
Rev. Paul "Weller says that every minister and every mother should under-
stand hypnotism for the benefit they can be to those with whom they arc
brought into dally contact.
In speaking of this marvelous power. President Eliot of Harvard College,
said to the graduates: "Young gentlemen, there Is a subtle power lying latent
in each of you which few of you have developed, but which, when developed,
miÂ£ht make a man Irresistible. It Is called Personal Magnetism or Hypnotism.
I advise you to master it." '
The New York Institute of Science has just issued 10,000 copies of a book â¢
which fuliy explains all the secrets of this marvelous power, and gives ' explicit
directions for becoming a practical hypnotist, bo that yoi can " employ the force .
without the knowledge of any one. Anybody can learn. Success guaranteed. .' .
The book also contains a full report of the members of ,the committee.. It
Â¦will be sent absolutely free to any one who' is interested. A postal card 'will
bring It. Write to-day. Â¦ -i

HIGH PRAISE
From Rev. Father Augustine McClory,
Â£ai FrarctfCi.
It gives me much pleasure to recommend
to the public Mr. George Mayerle of 1071%
Market street, San Francisco, strictly as a
tkillful and expert optician. My sight began
to fail in 1877. twenty-five years ago, and
t-ince tbat time I have been wearing gla3tes.
1 consulted a prominent optician In Chicago,
Dr. Holmes. At different times since that I
have had lenses fitted on in St. Louis, Cleve-
land, Ohio, and also tried the Fifth-avenue
opticians in Plttsburg, who claim to be
emong the best in their line in the country-
I do not hesitate to say that I have met wtÂ»h
better and more satisfactory results with Zr.
Mayerli than with any of the above named
who have much higher pretensions. Respect-

.Detectives Fitzgerald and Graham have
recovered* a lot of property which, was
stolen by Edminster, from residents of the
Mission.'. It will be booked as evidence'
against' tne prisoner--- â¢ -
It was learned last night that Edmln
ster,, prior to his being sent to the peni
tentiary from Oakland, attempted to com
mit suicide by JumplriK into the bay off
Fishermen's wharf. He was rescued after
considerable trouble, and when asked for
an explanation said he was tired - of life,
and wanted - to die. Shortly afterward
he went to Oakland and committed the
for which he was sent to San
Quentin for two years. .
Thinking that the unfortunate woman ,
was .about to collapse? Detective Tom"
Ryan, who was present, led her from the
prison. After considerable persuasicn
she was induced to leave the Hall of Jus
tice, after saying she would call again to
day to see her burglar husband.
. "I know I deceived you," he remarked
as tears gathered in hfs eyes. "For the
sake of our little girl let me be buried
within the walls of San Quentin or Fol
sqm. Don't tell her that her father was,
a thief;* teach her to forget me."
Edminster was taken from his cell and
seeing hls^ wife standing near the booking
desk he "ran to . her and, throwing . his
arms around her neck, asked her forgive
ness.
"1 must see him," she pitifully cried.
"I know that the police have made a mis
take." .
"I know It is all off with me," he sadly
remarked shortly after be 'was formally
charged. "I guess I will serve the rest of
my Â¦ life' in the penitentiary. . I am sorry :
for my wife, who is In aV delicate condl-.
tlon, and my little glrL God only knows
.what will become of them. However, I
am -guilty and must - take the conse
quences."
At least twenty people, who suffered at
the hands of Edminster, or who saw him â¢
leaving the houses of his victims, visited .
the City Prison yesterday and positively '
identified him. Late in the afternoon his
wife appeared at the prison gate and.
with tears streaming down her cheeks,
begged , to be allowed to- enter.
Edward Edminster, the cobbler burglar,
who was arrested Friday afternoon by
Detectives Ryan and O'Dea, was booked
last night on six charges of burglary. E<I
mlnster, who is well connected, J keenly
feels his disgrace. -... \
Willing to Plead
Guilty.
Miss'on- House Breaker
Mr. Tallant pleads 6elf-defense for
striking the match. He nad lost his way
in the mountains and when night came
was obliged to build a camp fire to pro
tect himself from the frost- <â¢ -V. :
Mr. IVood worth will therefore bring: suit
in the name of the United States against
Mr. Tallant for $50 damages, and Mr. Ta!
iant will pay the money without contest.
Nothing further was heard on the sub
ject until yesterday, when Mr. Wood
v.-orth received a letter from Mr. Xewhall
Ftating that justice would be appeased If
Mr. Tallant paid $50 into Uncle Sam'o
treasury for the Injury done to the re
serve and as "smart money."
ilr. ' Xewhall. who loves trees better
than most Inen love their dogs, was still
insistent on beginning' a criminal prose
cution against Mr. Tallant, but Mr.
Â¦\Voodworth would not consent, and Mr.
Xewhall went away after saying- that he
ti-ou1g write to Washington about the
matter.
"If t he has done any- damage 1 *am will
ing to begin a civil proceeding against
him for' damages," said Mr. Woodworth.
Several weeks ago C. S. Newhall, super
intendent of the reserve, called upon
United States District Attorney Wood
worth and asked that criminal proceed
ings be instituted against Mr. Tallant for
setting the woods on.Crc. As the maxi
mum penalty for building a camp flre In
the forest reserve is imprisonment for
not less than five years, plus a fine of
S1900, Woodworth required . particu
lars, Mr. Newhall made complaint to the
effect that Mr. Tallants camp flre had
spread over twenty square feet and
scorched some scrub oak and pine trees
Jir. .'Woodworth declined to begin crim
inal proceedings for a cause so trivial
against a respectable business man. Mr.
Xewhall protested, but his protests were
unheeded.
George Tallant of the Tallanf Banking
Company struck a match some time last
fall in the Sierra forest reserve, and la
consequence has become entangled In the
meshes cf the lew.
before Judge Mogan yesterday for prelim
inary hearing. Lucius H. Foote,was called
and testified that his wife was still unable
to talk owing* to her 'fractured jaw, and a
certificate was produced from Dr. Sher
man that; it would be twp.,weeks yet be
fore she could appear in court. The case
was .continued till to-morrow, and the de
fendants' bonds were raised from $2000 to
$4000 each. ' Â¦ , ;' â¢ . - -.

The estate bequeathed to Miss Getting*,

show at his apartments in downtown res
taurants, is valued at between $25,000 and
$40,000. -.:
"Whether the act was mental or me
chanical," says the court, "Max H. Ker
show wrote his name on that paper."
The question of jurisdiction was decided
in favor of the proponents. It was shown
that the Tale man had registered In this
city and also had property here, which, in
the opinion of the court, was enough to
show that "a foreign record had no force
and effect and was not a bar to the pro- Â¦
ceedlngs.'*t â¢ Â¦ - i
"Her memory as to dates was more than
imperfect, even when her testimony as to
dates was shielded by a card within or be
hind her satchel on the witness stand."
The court also commented on the "In
firmities In the testimony of John Roland
and Alice Kennedy,'* the nurses who cared
for Kershow during bis last Illness, and
In speaking of Mrs. Kennedy's memory or
dates said:. . . v _

also shown that he at times sobered up
and that* on those occasions his mind was

The ! first half s of the home-and-home
golf tournament-: over jj thirty-ste holes,
match play, between teams of ladies rep
resenting the San Francisco and Oaklana
Golf clubs, was -played" yesterday moru
lngr on the links at Adams Point. The re
sult was a win for Oakland 10 up. The
Oakland team was captained by Mrs. r.
E. Bowles and the San Francisco team
by Mrs. Laurance T. Scott. As one or
the San Francisco team failed to present
herself Mrs. P.< E. Bowles scored 2 up
by default. Mrs. R. G. Brown headed the
San Francisco team and scored 2 up
against Mrs. H. H. Sherwood, who Play? 3
number one on the Oakland team. The
victory of the Oakland eight was almost
wholly due to the excellent play of Mrs.
\V. P. Johnson, who played against Mrs.
Laurar.ce T. Scott, winner of Â«the
women's championship at Del Monte last
year. Mrs. Scott was 9 down. Miss Ives
and Miss McBean each scored 2 up for
San Francisco. The Oakland ladies' total
score was 16 up and that of the visitors
6 up. leaving the home team winners by
10 up. The results are given In full in
the table:

The concluding half of the match will
be played next Saturday on the Presidio
links. The scores made on both days
will be reckoned together and the winners
will carry off a sliver cup as a trophy of
victory.
Gear continues: "To be tola they â¢will
have a fine assessed if they dare accept
a position In another league where bet
ter money was paid was an action of this
combine, the minor leagues, directly
against the Interests of tho players and
was striking at the very root of tho
Players' Protective Association. It at
tempted to destroy all the good the union
had done Tor the players and I. as secre
tary of the association, will send out let
ters to all members warning them
against this new combine organized- la

ther shackle the players."
Gear wrote to-night to President Daly
in regard to the matter and will press It
to an issue between the players and
Powers' organization.
Gear further states the reserve clause,
against which the players fought and
which really resulted In the organizing of
the players, Is the foundation of the asso

must respect a reservation or be subject
to a heavy fineâ $1000 for leaving the.
Western League or Eastern League.
The players, Gear says, havÂ© secured
the concessions asked from the National
and American leagues and it is not their

secretary of the Baseball Players* Pro

to-night which indicates a clash is im

and the National Association oÂ£ Minor

THE: CALL'S RAGING 'FORM CHART;
py|-^HERE was a void In the pocket
I i of many a spectator at Oakland
.1 r track yesterday .when. Horton,
â¢JA wlth;Tommy Burns in the saddle,,
. finished third for the McLaughlin
Belling stakes, valued at $1500. v Even if the;
distance, one mile and a '. furlong, j was
somewhat of an oddity for him, the little
chestnut is such a popular favorite . that
his odds fell from 8 to 6 to even money.
But even the skill and tenacity of the
redoubtable Tommy failed on. this occa
sion. Form players figured the most dan
gerous, of 'the other three starters was
Scotch Plaid, picking up but 97 pounds.
They hit. the nail on the head, for. at the
start J. Ransch went out in the lead with
the Burns' & Waterhouse entry, and, al
ways the pacemaker, he. won'- pricking his
ears two lengths in advance of. Constel
lator. Burns made his move- on the far
turn with Horton, but when the mile had
been coverad looked beaten, and no end
of hard urging could move him up to the
leader. It was expected Constellator wouM
go out for the lead, but he was rated by
Jackson, which possibly did not improve
his chances. Frangible made, only a fair
showing. The winner pulled up lame and
will probably do no more racing for some
time to come. . . <
Despite the gloomy and threatening as
pect of the weather- there j appeared no
diminution- in the attendance. A light
downfall. of rain which started in after
the second race only served to lay the
dust Favorites performed creditably,,
capturing four of the six events.
None the less disastrous, pernaps, was
the defeat of Green Morris' crack colt
Homestead by The Pride, for the "Wood
land handicap at seven furlongs. Just a
nose separated the pair at the â¢wire, and
to the fact that O'Connor, drew his whip,
allowing the three-year-old j to â¢ swerve
with the wire within reacti, many ascribe
h;s downfall; Mercer, the mount of little
Redfern, closed favorite, with Homestead,
shouldering 113" pounds, next , to top
weight, second in demand at twos. At
.the start, which was > not one of Dick
Dwyer's best. Spencer went out In front
with Sly, closely trailed by Kitty... Kelly
and Homestead. There was little change
in this order until well into the stretch,
when O'Connor assumed the lead with
his mount. Johnny Woods all this time
had been riding a patient race on The
Pride, and in a well timed challenge he
caught Homestead leg weary, gaining the
decision by a nose. Almost left at the
post. Princess Titania came from the
backwoods, finishing a close third. While
in a prominent position, Mercer, the fa
vorite, bled, falling back to the rear. At
one time 10 to 1 could be obtained about
the winner. .
Walter Jennings took the first purse
with his Darebln filly Jacqueminot. She
closed equal favorite with the Schreiber
entry Killdoe, and ridden by Bullman led
all the way. O'Connor landed King Her
ald in the place, while Killdoe ran third.
* In races where the scale of weights Is
raised, Afghan seems to be a difficult
horse to beat. The chestnut went. to the
post favorite for the Futurity course
sprint carrying 127 pounds, with Lee Jack
son up. After Saul of Tarsus and. John
Peters had tired Jackson moved up with
his mount, leading Saul out a neck.
The two-year-olds we*e asked to go half
a mile, and the, Burns & , Waterhouse
youngster Thaddeus was again returned a
winner. His was not an easy victory,
however, for Spencer rode him out to the
last ounce to down Arabo a head, in Hi
seconds. The latter colt had 50 to 1 chalk
ed about him, and showed marked im
provement. Past Master ran a gofod
third.
Judging from his latest effort, Vesuvian
is now a front runner. The Jennings
horse wap the whole thing In the betting
on .the closing mile run, and led from
start to finish. Janice finished second
and Headwater third.
Track Notes.
Killdoe shows to better advantage
when allowed to sift along out. In front.
Sweet Caporal, one of the choice offer
ings in the second race, runs as if
afflicted with the gout. 1
Thaddeus appears to be onj of the use
ful sort, that no matter. In what kind
of company they startâ just win.
The fearfully hot'pace in the last race,
the first three-quarters in 1:16, must have
made The Fretter quit.
J. Ransch rode a nicely rated race on
Scotch Plaid.
Top weight and make the running was
asking too much of Sly.
The- Pride ought to be hard to beat
from now on. It looks as If he is thor
oughly acclimated.

In the other stake Chicago Boy, Lady

likely winners in the second round are
Loyal Lad, Tralee Boy, Narcissus, Hap

Freda C, Little Sister, Roman Athlete,
Vandal, Merrimac, Harlean Gladys, War

top and "War Eagle at the bottom of the
card are the strongest candidates.

land, quoted at like odds, failed to make
good with Elista.
After a few shorter pVlced jipsets
Wedgewood added to the misery of. the
men of wisdom by allowing-. Pasha Ken
nels' Royal Archer outwork him for the
flag. Wedgewood was -well* backed ' at 1
to 5. ; Â£;'; ':' );--..:. i
Sharman's Firm Fellow\ accorded j^lmi
lar treatment to Homer Boy, a' recent
stake- winner. He was so much inXftuvor
that the talent played him heavily r as a
1 to 5 choice. *%'Â¦']
In the course following Charta, A. R.
Curtis' stake-winner, was picked for a
good investment and her backers quoted
3 to 1 that she could outpoint Little Sis
ter. The speculators wsfe accommodated
quite freely, for Little" Sister in any com
pany Is not without stanch admirers.
Sister won the course in a long trial.
D. J. Healey's Tiburon was the first to
displease the magnates. Tiburon -was
figured to get well along in the stake and
was made a 3 to 5 choice over Freda C.
He made one point to. Freda's four.' -
Two stakes were run down yesterday
at Union Coursing Park and many 'good
trials resulted. In the stake of poorer
class the talent was In good form pick
ing winners. During the stake of twen
ty-six courses the judgment of the. wise
ones was reversed r in but four .instances,
none of which were . at odds strong
enough to worry. The happiness of the
big bettors was but temporary, for In the
run-down of the stake In which the
coursers of higher class contested the
knowing ones were given a shake-up the
memory of which will not be effaced for
a season at least. Eleven short ends
helped to put some heavy crimps In the
bank rolls of the capitalists, and long be
fore the programme had neared comple
tion many heavy investors quit the game
to fill downtown engagements.
The great setters and pointers In liae
Van Arsdale kennels will not be seerr in
competition again under his name. He
has leased his entire string to Charles
Babcock who in the past has served him
in the capacity of trainer. Dr. Daniels,
the pointer which won the All-Age stake,
will probably be taken East to the field
trials, together with some of the higii
class setters. Mr. Van Arsdale has never
sold a dog, any passing from his posses
sion being through gifts to friends.
Trainer Babcock can make such disposi
tion of them as he thinks wisest. The
kennels will be given some distinctive
name, In which the dogs will hereafter
be entered.
It was decided to hold next year's trials
on the second Monday in January at a
place to be selected by the excutive com
mittee. A vote of thanks was extended
Judge John A. Balmer Tor his conscien
tious efforts and his satisfactory decis
ions.
George Anderson of San Jose, S. Hodge
and Charles Douglass enjoyed some of the
shooting.
After the trials at Santa Maria the fol
lowing officers were elected for the Field
Trials Club for the enuuihg year: Presi
dent, Joseph E. Terry; first vice president,
W. W. Van Arsdale; second vice presi
dent, H. W. Keller; secretary-treasurei ,
Albert Betz; executive committeeâ W. S.
Tevis, Clinton E. Worden. C. JC. Post, J.
H. Schumacher and T. J. A. Tledemann.
Another party made up of J. Kllgarirt,
H. E. Keller, J. E. Terry and J. H.
Schumacher went out the same day and
shot over the crack dogs from W. S.
Tevis* kennel.
Fred Butler thought he had surely
found a Bportsmen'8 paradise. He se
cured the limit on quail each day with
hardly the expenditure of an extra cart
ridge. When his friends were starting
home he was preparing to go after
EngBsh snipe and had promised himself
some duck shooting and then another try
at quail.
When the trials were ended Mr. Van
Arsdale Invited a number of gentlemen to
shoot over his great dogs. In the party
were: Sam Cutler, C. W. HIbbard. T. J.
A. Tledemann, Judge Balmer, Mr. Elliott,
H. T. Payne, Mr. Trott and "Jim" Cooper.
The latter resides in Santa Maria and be
sides being a jolly companion In the field
he knew the habits of the quail as a good
shepherd knows the habits of his flock.
Men in the party familiar with conditions

that there was not a cent ln the man's

Conditions in London.
The lecturer then' alluded to lnforma-
Rabbi Voorsanger. then took a tilt at
the political situation- of this country
when. he reminded his hearers that- tho
Roman Â¦ imperial power, was elected h?.t
like the : politics of this country ltra "e
to a nominal sort of thing-the degenera
Â¦tion of conditions by machines that en
slaved. - ; '.
"In America," said Rabbi Voorsanger
.'we have some of old Rome's conditions
repeated." . * .
Here the audience applauded to the
echo, as though acquiescing comnletelv
in the lecturer's opinion. "mpieteiy
The Roman, more than the Greek took
great- pride in -his city. The Romans*
said he, created monuments, but different
to modern times ' they did not wait for
newspaper subscriptions, but erected
their monuments to their gods voluntarily
and with pride. Magnificent were those
temples." They vied with the palace- of
the nobles. Their arches of 'triumph were
not for themselves but | for the "concrete
binding of Rome-r-an evidence of the
pride they took in their city.. It meant
that whoever came to Rome must see
and appreciate Rome's power; that
Rome of the seven or ten hills : was
covered with great monuments represent- 1
ing .religion, science^ and. artâ that it
might be seen by all that Rome 'was the
heart of the world. But. the extrava
gances j of the times, the fabulous wealth
the lewd living sapped at the root.:*.'
. It is surplus w.eath, he said, that creat
ed immorality and when men do not work
they become>degenerates." That would be
his argument, he said, ; to . those who
would favor a working day ' of three
hours for, the laboring man. ' ; Man, i de
clared ithe rabbi, " must -work eight ; hours"
to keep! his mind and body in good
health. Â¦Â¦';, '-;,' \ y 7
i In this view the audience saw good rea
soning for again it burst out withering-'
ing applause. _.
America ;Like Rome, i
Rabbi Voorsanger kept an audience at
the Academy of Sciences at concert pitch
last night. The rabbi simply but elo
quently, recounted the fascinating history
of ancient Rome, and with its wealth and
its luxury, its art and its power, he made
comparison with the city of London. It
was a vivid parallel between the great
city of ancient and the great city of mod
ern time. He spoke of the London of
ancient date and the London of the Vic
toria era and that of Albert Edward.
He descanted upon the vice of Rome
and in parallel' lines he introduced the
vice of the English metropolis. He spoke
of the powej of old Rome, when she held
sway over the whole \ world and when
more than half the world, indeed,' dared
not breathe .unless Rome willed it. Re
turning to the parallel column he pict
uresquely placed out prominently the
power of London, with its magnificent,
outreaching potency, the seat of fashion!
of science, of learning and commerce; of
greatest wealth and direst poverty, of the
greatest virtues and the greatest Vice3.
The British power is no such power as
was Rome, for she was mistress of the
world, owned the world and her city was
recognized , as the centralization of gov
ernment. The s population was one hui
dred and twenty millions' of people and
out of that number six millions actually
owned all the rest, who were practically
slavesâ slaves made up of, the men of
England, Germany, Africa, of the wor'd
over. Of the thousand races Rome
gathered in the best, but the slaves were
not the slaves we to-day know, of They
were men of ' learning,' men of science
men of philosophy, and when freed thev
were assisted with I land and means *o
live while tilling the soil. They were not
the slaves such as we know who earn
enough to eat and enough to pay for their

Holden told the story in Judge Hairs
court to-day, where Jones was on trial
for insanity." . It was on Holden's evidence
that Judge Hall decided that the State
Hospital at Stockton was the proper place

Before the man had been in his presence
very long Holden realized that he had a
maniac to deal with. The man kept piling
on the coal until there was danger of the
heat setting tire to something. Besides,
his actions distracted the tower man's
attention frou; his work. When inild
measures faVÂ«i to induce him to go, Hol
den took hold of the man to force him

The next lecture at the Academy of
Sciences will be given one week from next
Saturday,, when Professor Frank Parsons
of Boston will speak on "Municipal Own
ership."
The lecturer said that in spite of all
sermons there is one danger to morality â
it Is not anarchy, but comes from empty
stomachs, a sentiment which the audience
applauded vociferously. He prayed for an
ideal city, wherein virtue shall reign, and
he trusted that such a condition would
come to pass, but before that time, he
feared, man will have to learn and elim
inate much of the injustice of which he
is the victim.
tion he had derived from General Booth
concerning the condition of London, and
drew a picture of the thousands upon
thousands of poor in that metropolis, of
the vast wealth and, returning again to
the poor class, denounced the evil of mod
ern timesâ the evil of aggregation In the
cities.

Sir Thomas Lauder Brunton delivered a
lecture before the Medico-Physiological
Association, in London, one day recently,
in which he declared ridicule of the divin
ing rod as an agent in discovering the
presence of water underground is a mis
take. He based his statements on experi
ments made by two extremely sensitive.
English women, who had proved that
while the witchhazel plant, commonly
used as a divining rod, did not itself con
tain any qualities influenced by water. It
was valuable in giving signs of the.in
voluntary muscular motion In the human
being produced by the presence of water
in the vicinity of the experimenter. The
scientist cited the camel In' the desert,
which detects water miles away, and
asked: "Why may not the human organ
ism involuntarily detect Its presence a few
feet away and Impress the fact on tho di
vining rod?*'

must be completed by October 1, 1902. and
that all must be finished by the end of

Reeves again confronted Neely 'with the
statement that Neely told him when he
was departing for the United States, in
September. 1899, that he was taking with
him $8000 which he had collected on dupli
cate warrants. The court asked Neely
what he had to say to. this, and hja replied
that Reeves was crazy, and that he would
show to the court that Reeves was not
with him under the circumstances related.
. When Neely denied that he had forged
the names on the warrants Reeves was
put upon the stand to reiterate the state
ment he previously made that either he
or. Neely had forged the names. Neely
looked Reeves in the eye and bade him
repeat the statement. This Reeves refused
to do. Neely's lawyer then asked the
court to appoint experts to examine the
signatures with the view of discovering
the forger. The Fiscal objected to the
step, but the court said It would note the
request. . . . ,
Neely was confronted with Reeves three
times. He maintained perfect composure
and evaded no questions, explaining â¢ all
transactions clearly and giving Reeves

The advent of womanhood is fraught -with dangers which even careinj
mothers too often neglect. Some of the dangers are belated and suppressed
menstruation. "The lily droops on its stem and dies before its bea^.y ia
unfolded." It is well demonstrated in Miss Caine's letter that liydto IS.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is certain to assist nature to perform
her regular duties, and young women who are irregular, or have any ailment
peculiar to their sex should hasten to commence the use of I.ydla ii.. -l^"^*.
ham's Vegetable Compound, and then sit down and write a letter to Mrs.
Pinkham telling her all about their illness; she will give the case careful
and motherly consideration, and advise just what to do to get well ; she considers
such letters strictly confidential ; she will charge nothing, and thousands ol
young women owe their present health and happiness to her advice.
Mrs. Pinkham invites all youngr women who are ill to write
her for advice. . Address Lynn, Mass., giving full particulars.
. MISS ELIZABETH CAINE.
"Dear Mrs. Pixkham : â I want to tell you and all the young ladies
of the country, how grateful I am to you for the benefits I have received
from using Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. I suffered for
eight months from suppressed menstruation, and it affected my entire sys-
tem until I became weak and debilitated, and at times felt that I had a
hundred aches in as many places. I only used the Compound for a few
weeks, but it wrought a change in me which I felt from the very begin-
ning. I have been very regular since, have no pains, and find that my
entire body .is as if it was renewed. I gladly recommend Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound to everybody." â Miss Elizabeth Caljte,
69 W. Division St., Fond du Lac, Wis.
" : When the young girl's thoughts become sluggish, when she experi-
ences headacheSj '"dizziness, faintness > and exhibits an abnormal disposi-
tion to sleep, pains in the back and lower limbs, eyes dim, desire for
solitude, and a dislike for the society of other girls, when she is a mystery
to -herself and friends, then the mother should* go to her aid promptly.
At such a time.the greatest aid to nature is Lydia E.Pinfcham*s Vege-
table, Compound. It prepares the young system for the coming change,
and is the surest reliance for woman's ills of every nature.
TFTten.you ask for Mrs. Pinkham's medicine at your druggist,
do not be persuaded to take something else said to be "just as
gpod.*' Nothing in the world is so good for women's ilia.

ciation building. Plans will be discussed
and arranged to facilitate the carrying

work. The association is non-sectarian.
Its work consists of locating those who
are not attending any Sunday-school and
in giving their names to the church of their
choice. When the delinquents are brought
to the' notice of their pastor the work of
the association ceases. If persons. are
found to have no preference for any church
their names are left at the' central office
of the association, where they are acces
sible to the pastors in whose districts the
persons reside.
-The visitation work is to be actively
commenced on the evening of January 29.
The city has been divided according to tho
school census districts. Over each dis
trict a superintendent has been Installed,
whose duty It Is to secure visitors, distri
bute the canvass books.Tecelve the reports
and return the names to - the super
intendent. Â¦

has i been \ carried on with flattering suc
cess in more than "100 cities in the East.

Pretty nearly all the hair preparations
for dandruff have some merit In allaying
Itching of the scalp, and in being a fairly
good dressing for the hair, but there )s
only one that recognizes -what causes
dandruff, falling hair and baldness, and
that destroys the cause, a little germâ
and that is Newbro's Herplcide. This
germ eats its way into the scalp, down to
the hair root, where it saps that vitality,
causing dandruff as it, digs up the scalp
into little -white scales. Unless. It is de-
stroyed there's no permanent stopping of
falling hair and. cure of dandruff and
baldness. Newbro's Herplcide kills the
germ. "Destroy the cause, you remove
the effect." ,

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 18.â There was no change
in the conditions to-day on which yesterday's
advancing prices were predicated. The bank
statement, taken as a whole, was a strong one
and the selling movement with which it was
in<-t was obviously profit-taking by professional
traders. Yesterday's upward movement was
c-or.tinued to some extent this morning, espe
cially In the coalers and some of the Indus
trials, but the latfr prolit-taklng wiped out all
the gains and left several important stocks a
point or more lower than last night. The re
duction In the minimum discount rate from 4
to Z\'i ptr cent and the very strong recupera
tion revealed by the Bank of Germany wm

improved situation in Germany. The Indica

The Old Doctrine TJpheld by the Eng
lish Courts in Recent
Cases.
One serious obstacle to the erection of
high buildings In London or any other
English city -is the statute of "ancient
lights." The Court of Appeal recently
handed down a decision on this law re
versinc the decision of the lower court. >
The statute Is an old one and provides
that any one who has a window in his
house overlooking his neighbor's land or
building gains In twenty years an abso
lute right to the light coming In at tho
window. The only way a neighbor can
defeat this Is by promptly erecting a
screen to block the window. In the pres
ent, case a factory in Leicester had been
used during the nrst part of the twenty
years for the making of boots and shoes
and subsequently for the manufacturing
of hoisery. Neighboring buildings have
recently grown in height, so that now
the factory has not so much light as it
once had, and the owners are compelled
to use more gas. The result was a suit
for damages. In the lower court the ac
tion was dismissed, but in the higher
court it was sustained on the ground that
the factory had won a right to. as much
light as had ever come Into the windows.
The exact point decided in the case is a
technicality which is not of specific im
portance, but it is interesting to note that
Knglish law is quite peculiar In this right
v/bich It gives to the man who builds first
to Interfere with building on his neigh
bor's land. The American courts have
definitely refused to recognize any such
right for the reason that it unduly ham
pers the development of towns. On the
Continent the matter is dealt with by for
bidding people to build, right up to their
boundary without their neighbor's con
sert.

ilall advices from New York 6ay: "A fair
degree of firmness Is noted throughout the en
tire list, but outside of scattering sales of the
principal articles there is no special move
ment to report. A somewhat better inquiry,
with resulting business, is noted in prunes for
forward delivery from the Coast on the t. o. b.
basis for both old and new. We hear of sales
to-<lay on the 3^0 four size basis for new Santa
Claras and Uc for old f. o. b. Coast to go to an
Interior market, and indications point toward a
resumption of buying interest. Spot prunes
are fairly steady, with scattering sales in a
small way around 6%c to â¬Â»ic for 40-50s Santa
Claras in 25-lb boxes. Sizes 70-80s are con
ceded to be in light supply and show some
firmness within the quoted range. Oregon
prunes are steady, with offerings from the
Coast around oVic f. o. b. on the four sizes.
In currants a moderate Interest is noted for
.-loaned in small lots ...within the quoted range.
Vncle&ned in barrels is steady, but practically
unchanged on the present basis. Some inquiry
is reported from interior markets, with buyers'
i'icas a shade under those of sellers here. Im
lÂ»>rted Valencia raisins are more firmly held
on the si'Ot. with 7Â»Â»c the general quotation.
stocks ar* in small compass and firmly held.
V>"e note the arrival from Malaga of 2000 boxes
pf raisins. California raisins are quiet, but
show some firrnuess within the quoted range
on both loose and seeded. Choice seeded in
cartons are available around 7?4c. but some
holders ask up to 8c for small lots. Fancy
sre firm. In small lots there is a fair move
ment to near-by Interior points. Apricots are
steady and in moderate request. Peaches arÂ«
attracting a little more attention, with some
l>uying reported from the Coast in round lots.
In dates the market continues to show strength

contested by supporting orders In the market by
insiders, or by inspired publications belittling
the Importance of these developments. These
efforts to contest a prevailing tendency were
apparently abandoned with the opening of the
week and depression and progressive neglect
have set in. The permission granted by the
Lnlted States Supreme Court on Monday to the
State of Minnesota to appear and argue its pe
tition for a hearing of its suit to prevent the
formation of the Northern Securities Company
clinched the likelihood that this great project is
to be subjected to litigation that probably will
be prolonged. The value of its securities and
the question of its existence are therefore to be
held In abeyance. The introduction of the se
curities to the market and the efforts for their
distribution have been much counted on by
speculators as a stimulating Influence In .the
whole market. Another chilling Influence on
speculation was the announcement of new
bond Issues by the Atchison and rumors of
other issues by the Erie and the Union Pacific.
The basis of these rumors is the announced in
tention of the two companfes to make vast out
lays for extensions. Improvements and better
ments. In the case of the Erie there stands the
declaration in the last annual report that "it
would seem the day is now approaching when
arrangements for new capital can be profit
1 ably made."
The proposed issue of $C5,000,C00 of additional
stock by the New York Central comes In the
same category of Influences. The granting of
rights, of subscription to stockholders at 125
operating as a valuable privilege at the pres
ent market price of the stock, has kept its quo
tations up. All through the recent period of rail
road prosperity much stress was laid upon the
large sums expended out of current net earnings
lor permanent betterments, fcr which additional
capital would ordinarily be looked to The
argument has been used that these expenditures
would forestall future requirements and make
possible a reduction of expenses in less pros
perous times and so make for the stabilitv of
future dividend rates. The issuance of "new
bonds and stocks opposes this contention, as it
puts new charges ahead of dividends or gives
new stock equal dividend privileges. The ex
isting car famine is also calculated to throw
doubt upon the sufficiency of recent outlay for
that purpose, on which such stress has been
ki"- T e a Psa rent spurt at this time of the
public demand for investment in securities adds
to the tffeot of these proposed lacee new oflfer
ings. So dc the developments in the affairs of
the trolley syndicate, the rubber trade and the
asrphalt trust. The theory tnat abundant capi
tal Is awaiting a favorable turn of affairs to
flow into Wall street's securities has to con
tend with the disclosures that enormous sums
have been ventured in these projects, whose se
curities have been almost unknown in the stock
market. It is an important question how far
this investment of large capital In great pro
jects ouulde of the stock market has pr-jceeiied
how ,ar banking resources have been committed
to these projects and hew tar difficulties of
realizing on them may develop, as they have
C i^ ne Vi Â£*** already disclosed. These con
siderations have caused an undertone of con
fervatlsrn and some uneasiness in the financial
world which the favorable reports of business
and trade have not entirely alleviated. The fu
' M"^. Â°? urse of railroad earnings is earnestly
; studied. Latest reports show satisfactory re"
turns, but reports are renewed of rate outtin~
in rplte of the complaints of lack of cars to
carry all the business offering. The easier
money conditions have railed to stimulate spec
ulation. The rush to retire banknote circula
tion is a symptom that ihe constant expan
f!a?ure f â¢ c , ircuIali^- which was a
r.â¢ ?â "iL laEt *â¢Â¦*Â¦â¢ conditions. is

Associated Banks' Statement.
NEW YORK. Jan. 18. â The statement of the
associated banks for the week endlni to-day
says :
â¢ Loans. $SG7.529.100; increase, $3,202,300.
Deposits. S9S:j.722,200: increase, 811,739.000:
Circulation. $31.995,Â»S00; decrease. $18,100.
Legal tenders. $76,570,700; increase, $95,:JCp
.Specie. $177,Kio,:Â»0O; increase, !jiS.lH2,0U0.
Reserves. $25V;42,OtiO; increase, $!t.u:!7,!M)0.
Reserve required, $234,W>U,u50; increase, t'2,
9:i-Â»,900. t
Surplus, $19,0til,450; Increase, $6,103,000.
The Financier says; The statement of the
New York Associated Banks for this week
showed a gain of $9,037,900 In cash, of which
$S,942,t;w consisted of specie and only $O5,!5O:>
of legal tenders. The increase in cash shown
by the statement Is, It will be observed, moiv
nearly in accordance with tne estimate of a
gain fcr the week of $7,011(5,500, which estimate
was based on the traceable movements of
mency during the week, than has recently been
the case. The gain reported in the official rc
lurn last week makes the total Increase of
i&feh since the beginning of the year W8,13-V
2l<Â». whereas the estimated gains far this
period were $25, 530, 000. Presumably the condi
tion of the banks at the close of th* bank
week was really much better, as .regards cash
reserves, than was shown by the statement,
there having been important payments by the
sub-treasury for unmatured bonds and also on
account 'of the redemption of Hawaiian securi
ties at the end of the bank weÂ»k. The loans
were increased by $;J,2O2,300,' Indicating only a
moderate demand from borrowers during the
week, probably the result of the professional
character of the speculation on the Stock Ex
change. Deposits were increased $ll,7;W,600.
and In this respect the statement may be said
very nearly to "prove" â the total of the gain
in loans and of cash being $12,330,200, or $600,-
C00 more than the Increase in deposits. The
surplus reserve was augmented by $6,103,000
to $19,061,450, against $30,799,450 at the cor
responding date In 1901, when the surplus was
at the highest point of the year.
London Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 18. â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram eays:
Thn stock market was quiet and cheerful' to
day, with South Africans advancing and Con
sols hardening on a revival of peace rumors.
American stocks mrrely reflected New York's
tone. Amsterdam sold a few hundred shares
Copper stocks wcrp firm* on the strength of
Amalgamated, but a fresh cut In the metal
is expected in America. - v.
The German Bank has reduced the discount
rate from 4 to 3% per cent, obviously to fa
cilitate the German-Prussian loans. This ren
ders a reduction by the Bank of Kngland rate
more probable,

CHICAGO, Jan. - 18.â At the outset wheat
had a comparatively small buslnepe, but
showed a decided improvement In tone under
the Influence of Improved spot ' and future
cables and dry weather damage reports. A
good deal of short covering was Induced by the
rapidly rising bullish sentiment and business
grew brisk. May opened ',4c to H@%c higher
at 80%c to 80%@80%c and' steadily ad
vanced. There were : reports of light rains in
the Southwest, but not sufficient to help the
suffering country. Kansas City reported one
fourth of th'e winter crop ruined. The South
western western . markets ! reflected this con
dition, especially St. Louis, where May was
selling at 88%c when it brought only 81c here.
Reports were current of renewed foreign de
mand for spring wheat and confirmation of
sales of that hitherto neglected variety came
from Buffalo, Some professional bulling { at
length set In and on the prediction of* freezing
temperatures In the winter wheat country St.
Louis houses began to buy. . May wheat
closed strong, *4@%c higher, at 81c.
Corn ruled firm and advanced steadily on
covering by shorts. Cables were Improved and
helped the bullish situation. May corn ad
vanced to a strong close, l@li.Jc higher, at
G4%@G4:Â£c.
Oats had a strong market and ruled higher
throughout the session. May closed strong,
l'ic advanced, at 46%c.
Provisions wers rather dull, but ruled firm
on light offerings and the grain strength. The
close was firm; May pork 7%cup; lard 2%c
higher and ribs 5@7Vic advanced. .

spoken of in England and America. . /'

There was the usual light Saturday business
on the Bond Exchange, with higher prices for
Giant Powder at $79 25@S0 20. This stock has
shown some fluctuation of late. It la said that
a recent change In the presidency of the Vigorlt
l'owdor Company led to some projects to es
tablish a new powder company to compete with
the present plants, which Impelled home bro
kers to sell down (Slant Powder, which ex
plains the recent decline. The new company
has not been formed, however, and as there is
less prospect for it now than a fortnight ago.
Giant has recovered tone and la regaining the
lost ground. The company is reported in first
class condition.- . -
In" regard to the rumors of thÂ« purcRasc of
the Californla-st Railroad by the Baltimore ayn
dtdate. which have presumably caused the rl3e
In this company's stock, but little la known
of the rumored purchase, and the brokers are
disinclined to credit It. The fine. showing of
the line la said to be the real cauÂ«e of the
advance. Brokers say that it can double its
present capital stock, and still pay the divi
dends it Is now paying every month. In fact,
the company- has - so much earned cash at Its
disposal that it has-been for some time In
vesting some : of Its surplus in buying its
own bonds as an Interest proposition.

At a recent Glasgow meeting of the
British Association for the advancement
of Science Vaughan Cornish read a paper
on the size of waves at sea. He said that
the height of the ocean waves in deep
water far from land had been determined
with fairly concordant results by a num
ber of independent observers. Ho gave
the following table as the average of tho
heights of a number of successive waves:
Hurricane. 2S.54 feet; strong gale. 2O.RÂ»

WHY THE ADVANCE IS MADE.
WHY THE ADVANCE IS MADE.
WHY THE ADVANCERS MADE.
The following letter from the Montezuma
Mining Company gives good reasons for the
advance in prices of shares:
-MONTEZUMA MINING COMPANY.
"TACOMA. WaÂ«h.. Dec. 14, 1901.
"The American Guarantee & Trust Co.,
"328 Montgomery street,
"San i-'rancisco, Calif.
Gentlemen:
"We beg to announce that on April 1st,
1902. the shares of the Montezuma Mining
Company will be advanced to 50 cents, pay-
ment In all cases cash. No Installment con-
tracts will be authorized or accepted by the
Company upon any terms after the date
aforementioned. Meanwhile, a regular
monthly rise in values, to be duly an-
nounced, will be rnade- until April 1st. Our
agents are asked to note these facts and
.govern themselves accordinjly.
"It has all along been confidently asserted
by the management that the shares of the
Montezuma Mining Company have been
quoted far below their actual values. The
increased prices, named above, are the best
guarantee" that we can give of our faith in the
above dictum often repeated to our agents.
The Company is now quite beyond the devel-
opment stage. It has the means requisite to
place its mining operations upon a paying
basis, as we believe. Of course, this state-
ment does not include the larger plans of the
Company, embracing the erection of coal
bunkers at Seattle. Tacoma and San Fran-
Cisco, and coke ovens at the latter point;
Improvements that must. It they are made,
come through additional sales of stock It
Is enough, for the present to say that by
April 1st the improvements the company
now have In hand will be complete and upon
an eminently profitable basis.
"If our hopes are realized, as we have
every confidence they will be, our shares
after April 1st will be sought after at a
price much beyond the figure we have
named. This is the argument and reason
Tor the sharp advance in price, named above.
â¢Our agents are asked to be guided strictly
by the facts. Monthly price notices will be
issued as usual, and the monthly letter of
the president will give yourselves and clients
full Information as to the progress made in
the several enterprises in which ' the Com-
pany is interested.
â¢â¢1'ours faithfully,
MONTEZL'MA MINING COMPANY.

RELLVBLE NEWS FROM THE MINES.
RELIABLE NEWS FROM THE MINES.
RELIABLE NEWS FROM THE MINES.
The Washington "Journal of Mining"
publishes Interesting news of our mines ana
others of the district, as follows;
"In the year 1901 all records have been
broken in regard to the amount of devel-
opment work done in mines. Especially is
this true of the development of copper, gold,
silver and coal properties, which has taken
place in the Carbon River Mining District
and the Tahoma Mining District.' In the
Carbon River Mining District a location hae
been made for a railroad running from Mon-
tezuma to the Surprise mines, the Chicago
group, belonging to the Montezuma Mining
Company, the Leola mines and the Copper
King mines, that will benefit a score of
other properties on which work is . belnn
done. The right of way of this road through
the forest reserve has been eranted by the
Government to the Washington Co-opera-
tive Mining Syndicate. The tunnel of the
Leola Mining Company, 725 feet long, has
been leased to the Washington Co-operative
Mining Syndicate, who have installed com-
pressed air machinery, and have iet a con-
tract for 400 feet of entry which is to con-
nect this tunnel with their Surprise group of.
veins at a perpendicular depth of 300 feet
below their present working. This tunnel Is
being pushed by night and day ehifts and
will soon cross the mother lode, which in
turn -will tap the Surprise and Guiley veins,
thus putting 'in Eight an immense quantity
of ore. â¢ Â¦
"The Copper King group of mines is sit-
uated north of the Surprise group. This com-
pany, during the present season, extended
the trails to the location at which they are
developing the ore, and have erected houses,
stables and other necessary quarters, aruj
will undoubtedly make a great showing dur-
ing the coming year.
"In the Tahoma District a great deal of
money has been expended by the Montezuma
Mining Company and the Washington Co-
operative Mining Syndicate In perfecting a
Bret-class trail to their mines situated on
\ht Mowich River, fifteen miles from Monte-
zuma. The Montezuroa Mining Company
has lr stalled on the Tahoma group of mines
a compressed air plant, which was attended
-with a great deal of difficulty, as the lum-
ber all had to be whipsawed from Alaska
cedar at a high altitude, and the machinery
had to be packed In, and some portions
which were heavy snaked in over the trail,
but the plant Is now running and develop-
ment work "will be very "â¢ rapid. This' com-
pany has already driven 250 feet of entry on
the large veins of chalcopyrite ore, and they
are now running- another on the same vein
150 feet below the first entry. As their ore
in the upper entry ran from six to seven-
teen feet wide, with values ranging from
J25 to $125 per ton, this lower entry will
put in sight by spring a vast quantity of
ore which beyond question will warrant the
building of an electric railroad for its
transportation.
"The Montezuma Mining Company are
opening a large coal mine at Montezuma.
and are shipping coal. The coal measures
they are developing are geologically the old-
est that have been developed in the State,
and a test of this coal made by the quar-
old; also wire netting, gates ana posts. AiÂ±ts.

Report on the Colorado Industrial
â¢ School Methods Severely Ar
raigns" a Superintendent.
DENVER. Jan. 18.â The report of the
committee from the State Board of Char
ities and Correction on conditions at the
State Industrial School for Boys, submit
ted to Governor Â¦ Orman and made public
by him to-day, is. a severe arraignment of
Superintendent Mlrlck and the other offi
cers of the institution.
The committee finds that corporal pun
ishment at the school has been excessive
and that the best interests of the school
demand the removal ot the superintend
ent and other officers. A complete change
in the conduct of the school is urged.
GOVERNOR IS ASKED
TO REMOVE A2T OITKHAL
' Professor Heinksler stated that the
Judges were of the unanimous opinion
that the merits were with the affirmative.
They believed that Mr. Reilly was the
best individual debater and Mr. Me-
Grill's spontaneity impressed them very
much.- . . .
W. A. McGrill. in rebuttal, cleverly an
swered the arguments set forth by Mr.
Boyen. When he concluded the Judges
retired. During their absence Miss Viv
ian Herzog rendered a number of selec
tions. .
He submitted that labor Unions seek to
undermine the very foundation of our
Government. He advised the laboring
man that his true interests lie with his
employer and not outsiders, because his
hope of reward rests with him," and that
the laboring man's secret to success lies
in doing the best he can in every position
he assumes.
Henry Boyen proved a worthy repre
sentative of the San Rafael. High School.
He gave evidence of having experience
in debating. He showed true ability and
delivered an able argument.
Miss Marion Dewey took up the argu
ment and treated the views of the pre
ceding speaker in a cynical vein. She
pointed out the danger of unions and their
lack of value in a community. She said
it was absurd to say that the employer
tries to crush labor, that on the contrary
when business is brisk the employer doea
everything he can to advance the inter
ests of his; employes. She said working,
men should not lose sight of the fact that
strikes tend to destroy industry. She
dwelt on the hardships occasioned by
strikes brought about by labor unions.
She claimed that strikes proved a setback
to the community and an Injury to both
laborer and employer. The speaker main
tained that labor unions are disastrous,
as they cause stagnation in business land
loss of wealth by forcing dissent between
employe and the employer. This being
so she could not see how labor unions
promoted the laboring- man's welfare*
Â¦\V.j A. McGrill followed. He ridiculed
the statement of the preceding speaker
that Australia had received Its greatest
setback through labor unions. Like his
colleague, Mr. Reilly, the speaker pos
sessed a strong- voice and good delivery.
He clinched his statements with facts and
even delved into statistics to prove that
worklngmen were benefited by labor or
ganizations. -
E. J. Reilly followed. He proved a
forceful speaker. HJs argument was clear
and conclusive and was appreciated by
his auditors. He pointed out the value
of labor unions to the laborer. He
proved that labor had its rights as well
as its duties and that capital had its du
ties as well as its rights. The speaker
argued that labor unions were opposed
to strikes and spent less money In them
than anything they were interested in.
He showed that labor unions are a perma
nent feature of democratic society and
that they are placed as a bulwark cf
economic conditions.
The speaker was heartily cheered for
his splendid paper.
When the applause had subsided Miss
Georgia Doody, a bright young lady,
argued against the question. She con
tended that the raising of wages is often
counterbalanced by' developments that
give the workingmen no real benefit In the
end. .
In labor unions - the individual sacrifices
everything for the good of all. The laboring
man believes that he should be treated de
cently and he should be given fair wages, that
he may live comfortably and his wife care for
his home and his children be kept at school.
In order to secure these rights, organization is
his only hope and salvation. . Kxperlence has
taught him that in union there Is strength.
If the worklngmen remained submissive they
would find themselves in no better condition
than the people of Egypt, who were compelled
by despotic kings to build the pyramids that
they might inter their dead therein and leave
something to make future ages marvel.
Let us survey the economic status of our
people at this time. In every branch of labor
they are receiving better wages and shorter
hours. But even though with all the powers
they possess the tendency of the great corpor
ations has been toward the subjugation of the
worklr.gmen and theÂ» ignoring of their remon
strances. : ' '
A. H. MacDonald, principal of the Lin
coln Evening- Commercial School, pre
sided. The judges of th& contest were
Professor ' Heinksler, â¢-- Professor Over
street and Judge Alfred J. Fritz.-
R. S. Lawlor was the first speaker. He
said in part:- ' >
The affirmative was taken by the Lin
coln Evening . Commercial School and the
San Rafael High School had the negative.
The former school was represented by R.
S. Lawlor, E. J. Reilly and "W. ;A. Mc-
Grlll. The colors of the San Rafael In
stitution were upheld .by Miss Georgia
Doody, Miss Marion Dewey and Henry
Boyen. â¢
"When the Judges announced last even
ing that the Lincoln Bvening Commercial
School were victors of the debate the
lusty-lunged, youths in the gallery nearly
raised the roof of the Girls'. High School
building with their yells of delight. The
contest was held under the auspices of
the Debating League of California. The
question argued was: "Resolved, that,
labor unions promote the best Interests
of the worklngmen."
