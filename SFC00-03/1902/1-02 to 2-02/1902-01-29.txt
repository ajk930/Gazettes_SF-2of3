.As soon as Santos-Dumont returned to

of the English and American colon'es

In order, to facilitate his future landing*

the bay a wooden jetty, where a floating
guide-rope can be grasped at the moment
of the return of the airship.
In a few moments he succeeded, as he
had. done In the morning, in the difficult
operation of making a landing on the nar
row space between the aerodrome and tb.3
bay. He was congratulated for his skill
and delicate maneuver, but the auronaut,
modestly declining all praise, attributed,
as heretofore, the successful result of his
trials to the protection afforded by . the
medal given him by the Princess Isabel.
Congratulations for Inventor.
At the end of half an hour Santos-
Dumont was seen to turn, describing a
curve with a radius of more than a kilo
metre. He returned in the direction cf
Port d'Hercule, passing alongside the ter
race of the Casino and Traux Pigeons,
where he was loudly applauded.

Flaherty, the murderer, was a bartender
ir. Bloomers saloon at 36 Golden Gate
avenue. .He formerly worked in a stable
on the same street and went ' to Manila
with a shipment of horses. He showed
no remoHÂ§ or regret for his dreadful
act and seemed to glory in it. While he
was being- conveyed to the station
, he remarked that Roller deserved
to be dead. Roller was a total stranger
to Flaherty. The tragic death of the
young engraver caused considerable ex
citement In Hayes Valley last night and
deep sorrow was expressed on all sides
for his death.
Flaherty started for the door. Umland.
not believing, according to his story, that
bis friend Roller had been wounded, fol
lowed the murderer to the door trying to
'explain to him that he knew nothing of
the dog. Flaherty turned his weapon on
Umland and fired, but the bullet sped high
above the proprietor's head and buried it
self in the wall,
Oflicer J. A. Crowley " and John B.
Charleston heard the shooting and hurried
to the scene. The last named caught Fla
herty, the murderer, and placed him un
der arrest. He was taken to the City
Prison, where a revolver, two of the
chambers of which were empty, was
found upon his person. Despite this dam
aging bit of evidence, Flaherty denied
absolutely that be had fired the fatal
fehot. Further than that he refused to
talk. . r /.;-;:-
Young Roller was immediately taken to
the Central Emergency < Hospital, but he
died while he was still In the patrol
wagon. It was found that the bullet had
entered his breast, directly below the left
nipple. Roller was one of the best known
and most popular yourg men of- Hayes
Valley, where he was born about twenty
three year* ago. For many years he had
been in the employ of Shreve & Co. -and
was deemed a first-class workman. He
possessed a genial disposition and was
never known to quarrel. He. was a prom
inent member of several fraternal socie
ties.
At this point, when all were terrified by
the sight of the frenzied man wildly flour
ishing a revolver. F. A. Roller caught
hold of Flaherty's wrist and attempted
to get possession of the weapon. With
cruel strength Flaherty slowly and delib
erately turned the revolver until It point
ed almost directly at Roller's heart and
then pulled the trigger. Roller sank to
the floor with a cry. "I'm done for."
When Mrs. Flaherty finished her tele
phoning her dog bad either jumped down
frcm its perch on the chair and run out
of the store or had been enticed out by
one of the customers. The lady looked
about the store for her pet, but could not
find it. She then went outside and called
it by name, but the animal did not put
in an appearance. Believing that the peo
ple In the store had kidnaped her dbg.
Mrs. Flaherty sought the aid of Police
man John B. Charleston, who went Into,
the saloon and asked for the dog. He
was also told that the animal was not
there.
Still unsatisfied, Mrs. Flaherty went to
her husband and told him her troubles.
Flaherty and hia wife returned to the sa
loon. On entering the door Flaherty de
manded the dog and when told the ani
mal was not in|the saloon he drew a re
volver and declared with an oath that if
the dog was not immediately forthcom
ing he would shoot every man in the
place. Flaherty was evidently in a vio
lent, mood and not to be pacified. His
wife tried to calm him, but he only gave
freer rein to his rage.
The murder of Roller grew out of the
loss of a little dog which belonged to
Flaherty's wife. Mrs. Flaherty entered
Umland's saloon shortly after 9 o'clock
last night to secure a pitcher of milk.
She brought with her the dog, which she
placed on a chair while she used a tele
phone in the store. Those who were pres
ent in the store state that she telephoned
to her husband, with whom it appears
Bhe had had some trouble. She remained
at the 'phone for a considerable length ol
time, almost three-quarters of an hour.
Without the slightest provocation, ac
cording to witnesses, Thomas Flahercy,
a bartender in a saloon at 36 Golden. Gate
avenue, deliberately shot F. A- Roller, an
engraver for Bhreve & Co., to death last
night in a saloon at 311 Franklin street.
The murder was committed In the pres
ence of William Umland. proprietor of
the saloon; F. B. Howard, Julius Levyt
Jack Sullivan and two other men who
chanced to be in the saloon at the time.
All the witnesses told the police that the
shooting was cold-blooded and without
the slightest reason. After shooting Roller
Flaherty turned his pistol on Umland. the
proprietor, and flred at him, but tbe bul
let went wide of the mark.

"The | investigation â¢ of General Metcalf e

based' on an ; affidavit made by Private
Huskey, formerly of the Kansas regiment.
Huskey swore that he saw Metcalfe shoot
unarmed' prisoners. That was : in March,
lS99.%'.In' March, 1900, Huskey: appeared be
fore a board of. army officers appointed to
Investigate Metcalf e's . connection : with
the affair. . Here he 'stated that the prev
ious 'affidavit was secured from him by a
Kansas officer after the latter .had gotten
him drunk. : Huskey ; said Â¦ that ; he signed
a paper,' but had no knowledge of its con
tents. This was the affidavit upon which
the- charge against ; Metcalfe .was based.
He^denled '.every, statement Â¦ made in the
affidavit at the hearing in March. 1900."
Funston made the trip to Kansas City
alone and arrived unannounced. He soon
sought out his physician and submitted
to an examination of the wound from
which he has experienced trouble lately.
Whether: or n'dt another operation would
be necessary the physician was not ready

direction of the Postmaster General Sec
retary of War and Secretary of the Navy
The sum of $500,000 is made immediately

Jan"J 2S.â The War De
partment is. not disposed to take any ac
tion respecting General .Whea ton's utter
ances, which were quoted in the Senate
yesterday. This is because the officials,
after studying, the Manila dispatch, in
which General Wheaton was quoted, are
satisfied that the . debate In the Senate
proceeded upon an entire misapprehension
of what General Wheaton was reported
tohave said. Â¦ It was found that General
Wheaton did not criticize the United
States Senate or its committee, and it is
thought at the department that the mis
apprehension on that score arose from a
general statement in the dispatch attrib
uting such criticisms to : other persons
than General Wheaton. Â¦â¢Â¦.: .-â¢:. . :

merce, which passed the Senate to-day,
was amended in -Various particulars.

to be a member of the Cabinet, an assist
ant secretary, and also the other officials
and clerks necessary. The proposed de
partment is especially charged with the
collection and distribution of statistical
information and with the development and
fostering of foreign and domestic com
merce. In the department there is to be
a new bureau of manufactures and many
bureaus now included in other depart
ments are transferred to this hew depart
ment, including the life-saving service,
the lighthouse service, the marine hotpi
tal service, the steamboat inspection ser
vice and the bureau of navigation, ship
ping and immigration, as well as the con
trol of the fisheries and the Chinese ex
clusion questions, all now within the ju
risdiction of the Treasury Department;
the Fish Commission and the Census Bu
reau. The department is also given juris

Irritation was aroused on both sides of
the chamber and once or twice personal
encounters Â¦ between Senators seemed Im

taunted the Republican Senators by de
claring that they knew the "statements

of Lletuenant Birdsall's old command,
were present when the signal to fall in
was given. An especially rich menu had
been prepared and It Is needless to say
THE members of Company A, Sec
ond Division of the police force,
gave a banquet in honor of Lieu
tenant George Birdsall at one of
the rotisseries yesterday.
This was the first function of thÂ© sort
ever given by .the police as a body to any
one in authority In police circles in this
city, but it having received the sanction
of Chief of Police Wittman, there was
nothing to mar the full pleasure of the
occasion for all who participated. The
dinner was in honor of Lieutenant Bird
sall, who. after years of efficient service
in the- lower part of the city, has been
transferred to new fields of operations at
the City Hall. His successor Is Lieuten
ant Martin and the appearance of the lat
ter at the banquet board was the signal
for a Kenuine ovation.

SEATTLE, Jan. 28.-A. Frazer, a North
ern Pacific section employe at Leary, met
a horrible death on Sunday night. Dur
ing the greater part of Sunday he had
been drinking in Leary. In the afternoon
he left town and started southward, walk-
Ing along the railroad track. When two
miles south of Leary he fell through \ a
cattle guard on the track and was unable
to extricate himself.. As. night came on
he was still in his perilous position A
Seattle-bound freight train was due about
that time, and signs about the cattle
guard tell all too plainly of the half-intox
icated man's attempts to wrench himself

At the head of the table sat Lieutenant
Birdsall, flanked by Sergeants H. H.
Christiansen, J. J. Burnett and J. H.
Helms. A jplace of honor had been re
served for Chief of Police Wlttman, but
he was unavoidably absent. He was not
forgotten, however, for a standing toast
was drunk in his honor.
During the courses speech-making was
the rule and. at this task the officers
showed themselves to be more than mere
novices. Lieutenant Birdsall in respond
ing to a toast said that he left his old
command with genuine regret and that he
was certain he would never be associated
with a more gallant body of men In the fu
ture. He paid a tribute to the police force
as a whole and said its like was not to be
found elsewhere within the whole United
States. At the conclusion of his remarks
the officers present stood and drank a
toast to their departing commander.
Sergeant Helms, who succeeds Birdsall,
expressed himself in fitting language
when called upon. He said he â¢ entered
upon his new duties with the full con
sciousness that his predecessor was a man
of rare talent whom It would be impos
sible for him to surpass. He hoped, how
ever, that he would do as well in part,
and with the support of the command the
interests of the city and department
would not be neglected. Sergeant' Helms

SOME OF THE FACES SEEN AT THE BANQUET GIVEN IN HONOR OF POLICE LIEUTENANT BIRDSALL
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON BY THE MEMBERS OF COMPANY A, FIRST DIVISION,' WHICH WAS UNTIL
RECENTLY COMMANDED BY THE GALLANT OFFICER. .
In a statement this afternoon Hiram
W. Johnson, attorney for Mrs. Coleman,
declared that every effort was made by
the contesting nephews and njeces to In
volve the sisters of Mr. Coleman In the
contest, but they declined, being satisfied
with his disposition of the property.
That said Florence A." Coleman has already
broken and repudiated all said promises, and
<3o*s not intend, and has not at any time In
tended, to live up to or keep any of them.
The prayer of the contestants Is that
the will be revoked and vacated and that
it be adjudged that William P. Coleman
died Intestate.
That said Florence A. Coleman represented
to and promised said William P. Coleman that.
If he would make eald alleged will wholly In
her favor, she would pay over and deliver to
these contestants and to the said two sisters
of said William P. Coleman as much money
and property as he otherwise intended by his
'will to bertow upon them, and as much as they
would be entitled to receive out of his estate
by the laws of succession and distribution if
he should die intestate. â¢ â¢ â¢ .
False Premises Alleged.
That immediately thereafter, and continu
ously down to the writing and signing of said
alleged will, said Florence A. Coleman took
advantage of the weakness of mind and Im
paired faculties of said William P. Coleman
and exercised over him an undue. Improper and
preponderating influence, and. by continuously
representing that ehe was more affectionate
and attentive toward him than was any one
else, and that no reward could be too great to
compensate a young woman like her for the
sacrifice made by her in marrying a feeble,
decrepit old man like him. and that his blood
relatives, these contestants, had no affection
for him and cared only to obtain his prop
erty â¢ â¢ â¢ Induced and persuaded him,
under her dictation and without his being
competent to exercise free and untrammeled
Judgment and will in the matter, to prepare
and sign, as these contestants are informed
end believe, the alleged will which has been
admitted to probate.
That a short time prior to the date of said
alleged will and with the Intention of persuad
ing and inducing him to bestow upon her all
his property and to Ignore in his will blood
relatives, these contestants; and while the
said William P. Coleman ' was very old, de
crepit, infirm and childish, and suffering from
disease, and i-ery feeble, both bodily and men
tally, and incapable of resisting undue influ
ence exerted upon him. the said Florence A.
Coleman. who was and Is eorr.e forty or more
years younger than the said William P. Cole
xnan. coaxed and wheedled the eaid William
P. Colexaaa into marrying her.
That at the time the said alleged will
of deceased, which has been admitted to
probate herein, was written, dated and signed,
the said William P. Coleman was not of sound
and disposing mind, and was incompetent and
Incapable of making a last will and testament,
and wholly incapable of making a reasonable,
legal, sensible and rational testamentary, or
ether, disposition of his estate and property.
or any part thereof.
These contestants further allege, that the"
â¢xecution by the said William P. Cole
rnan of the said instrument, . which has
been admitted to probate by the above entitled
court as his last will and testament, was ob
tained through, and resulted from, misrepre
sentation, fraud and undue influence made use
of end exerted upon him by Florence A. Cole
xsaa. â¢
The sensational charges In the coin
plaint are contained in counts 6 and 7,
Â¦which boldly accuse Mrs. Coleman of hav
ing coaxed and wheedled her aged hus
band into bequeathing her all his prop
erty and cutting out his blood relatives.
The counts allege:
Mrs. Coleman has been for several years
one of the leaders in Sacramento society.
She has also taken a prominent part in
eociety in Woodland, where, as Miss
Florence Craft and afterward as Mrs. Ar
nold, she was widely known. . "

suit filed this afternoon are: Joslah M.

contest waÂ« brought In this county to-day

VICTORIA. B.' C. Jan. 28.â The boat
found by the Indians of the Ahousett res
ervation on the west coast of Vancouver
Island, as reported in yesterday's dis
patches to The Call, was undoubtedly one
from the- missing warship Condor. Cap
tain Townsend, master of the steamer
Queen City, which returned this after
noon from the coast, made an examina
tion of the boat, and from his descrip
tion of marks thereon the naval officers
are positive that it came from the Con
dor.' iu Â¦'Â¦Â¦ . Â¦*;;*â¢'Â¦ â¢â¢ - i;-..-.:.
The boat was picked up by the 'Indians
four miles from the reservation on the
morning of January 6. and the fact of
the find was not reported until the pres
ent trip of the coasting steamer. It -had
drifted on to the rocks and there was a
hole in the port side of the bottom about
one foot or more in length and six inches
in width". Otherwise the boat was in
tact. On its bow were little panels of
hardwood raised about an inch and a
half or two inches from the gunwale, and
on these was the letter "C" in brass. On
the boat's stem was the broad arrow,
which is a mark peculiar to the boats of
the British navy, and near by were the
figures "XVI" In Roman numerals. Be
low the Roman numerals were the letters
"S. I. I. B," or "S. H. B.," with the cross
bar of the "H" obliterated by the sea.
Below these letters was marked in
smaller letters, "Sh. 98." This mark no
doubt stands for "Sheemess, 1898," for it
was in the Sheerness yards that the miss-
Jpg sloop of war. was built in that year.
On the boat were two grips made of gal
vanized iron, an iron ring about six inches
in diameter and" four pieces; of galvan
ized ~ Iron chain; two ; feet -long. There
were one or two letters on :the rings, on
one being "M. T." and on one of the
chains was "S. ' R." The boat was of
hardwood, . about seventeen feet long,
white painted, copper fastened and clin
ker built. â¢ -~O Â¦ :
â¢ Â¦ It Is so certain that this was one of tho m
boats of -the missing Condor â¢ that"
H. M. S. Egeria has gone to
the scene to get the boat from
the Indians. The Egeria left Esquimau
yesterday afternoon. The U. S. S. Grant
will In all probability have procured the
boat -before the British warship arrives
at Ahousett, for the Grant was spoken at
Uclulet by the Queen City and told of the
discovery. ' â¢ . ' : â¢
Gold Watch in the Wreckage. *
The Queen City on her arrival from the
coast brought no further. news. of the life
buoy marked "Red. Rock, Glasgow," , and
the few. cases of salmon which have
come ashore on Long Beach, just above
the black sand mines of Wreck Bay, and
no further wreckage from the salmon
ship is reported other than the hardwood
stanchions and white painted cabin doors.
The life buoy was found by a white set
tler living in that section. "
From . Cape Beal the Queen City
brought news that a gold watch and an
English chronometer had come ashore on
wreckage from the upturned vessel which
had drifted into that port, as previously
reported. The gold watch was numbered
55833. It was an open face watch. , On the
back was a maltese cross with a green
stone in the center. A gold chain with
long square links was with the watch.
Nothing could be learned as to the iden
tity of the vessel, which had a green hull
and was Â¦ coppered. It was too large for
a sealing cruiser and was evidently one
of the lumber coasters.

declares that he will have only trusted
men as guards and he knows nothing
about the men whom the Civil Service

the eight-year-old horse George Arnold,

Track Notes.
FACTIONS AGREE
TO CEASE STRIFE
THE betting on the outcome of the
meeting between the crack middle
weight boxers, George Gardner
and Jack Root, has commenced, al
though;, the wagering up to the
present time has been light. :
As was expected, Gardner has been in
stalled favorite, the opening" odds being
10 to 9. i What the closing odds will . bo
are hard. to forecast, depending, largely
upon the confidence which Root's support
ers will show. :
Gardner -cut down his work noticeably
yesterday athis Cclma training quarters.
/He did not go far on the road, confining
his work almost entirely to sprinting tu
develop his speed. He did no boxing in the
afternoon, as he did not want to risk in
jury to his hands.
Toby. Irwin will be. afforded an oppor
tunity.to show his present form when, he
meets Jimmie Reilly. His victory, over
"Doc" Flynn at Oakland last Friday was
decisive. The. other preliminary will be/
between Jack Dean and Gus Saulsbury.;'

Only four started in the Palo Alto han
dicap, at one mile and a sixteenth, for
Â¦which All Green had been allotted top
weight, 120 pounds. With Henry Spencer
in the saddle, the best the Easterner could
do was to drop in third. Janice, the 9 to
10 favorite, carrying 105 pounds and ridÂ«
den by Lee Jackson, won at the close with
little to spare from Greyfeld.

15 to L Second to Meteoro to the stretch,
the Chinn & Forsythe entry then took the
lead and In a hard drive led Yrsula out a
neck. Satchel, the favorite, slow to leave
the barrier, was repeatedly cut oft*.
Tommy Burns on Arabo, favorite for
the two-year-old dash, succeeded in beat
ing the barrier a couple ot lengths, after
which he won all the way. Gold Van,
from Green Morris' stable, made his first
start, finishing a good second in front of
Mi Relna. â¢ â¢ â¢ ?*.Â«? :
Winnie O'Connor on Shell Mount, favor
ite for the six and a -half furlong three-',
year-old run, had a narrow escape from
cefeat. He took his mount back before
reaching the far turn, and later was
brought to a fierce drive to down Hua
chuca a head. Rubus disposed of Pres
tano, the only other starter, for show
honors.
Bathos turned up an easy winner of the
mile and a sixteenth selling affair, start
ing a 6 to 5 favorite. Mounce waited to
the stretch, and then coming with a rush
beat Lavator and Wolhurst hands down.
NO GREAT amount of surprise was
occasioned by the showing made
by AH Green in the Palo Alto
handicap at Oakland yesterday,
for the Eastern horse has a very
suspicious set of underpinning, but the
result of the last event proved a stag
gerer for the talent- It was a six-furlong
scramble decided .under selling conditions,
and Tom Ryan's The Pride went to the
post a 7 to 5 chance. Johnny Woods rode
the favorite, and fourth position was as
close as he ever got to the firing line.
Maresa, a 40 to 1 shot, piloted by Hoar,
trailed San Venado for more ; than half
the route, and then took the lead. Later
the outside was joined by King Dellis, a
30 to 1 chance, and Sweet Tooth, one of
the second choices, all three fighting it
out. Maresa gained the decision by a
neck, with Redfern, on King Dellis, out
riding Gannon, astride Sweet Tooth, get
ting the place by a nose. Sea Queen,
practically left at the post, made a line
run, finishing a fair fourth.
The track still showed some traces of
the rain, -but by this afternoon will be
fast. Favorites captured four purses. ...

hours on the turbulent breath of a full

Captain J. S. , Bryan was before a sub
committee of the Senate : Committee on
Interoceanic Canals. to-day. He is an. old
sea captain and has spent much time in
the coastwise trade ; of ; Central America.
He also has had an experience of several
months in navigating -Lake Nicaragua
and has traversed the Panama route. He
expressed" a strong preference for the
Nk;aragua route . because of climate and
feasibility. . ;
The first provision looks to the acqui
sition of, the franchises, right of way and
other property of the new Panama Canal
Company of France, including that;com
pany's control of the Panama Railroad.
The President is authorized to pay $40,
000,000 for these, "provided a satisfactory
title can be. obtained.".' He is then au
thorized, to secure the necessary conces
sions from the republic .. of , Colombia,
these -to include the perpetual control of
a ten-mile strip of territory from the Ca
ribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean. A ca
nal sufficient to accommodate the largest
vessels is then' to be constructed under
the supervision of the Secretary of War.
The bill also carries an alternative pro
vision authorizing the President to pro
ceed with the construction of the Nica
ragua canal in case he fails; to secure the
necessary concessions from . Colombia or
a satisfactory title from the Panama Ca
nal Company. An immediate appropria
tion of $10,000,000 is made in either event.
The limit of cost is fixed at $135,000,000 in
case the Panama route Is: chosen,- while
$160,000,000 is allowed -in case the choice
falls on the Nicaragua route.: â¢ -
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28.â Just before

.Gold is by.no means the only product that Alaska,
offers to reward enterprise. It is believed 'by some
investigators that the copper mines of the country
are the rich'est in the world, and that it, wpiyd.be well,
worth while to construct a considerable railway for '
the purpose of developing the copper districts^ even;
if nothing else were in sight. .
Reports from Alaska encourage the- expectation
that the line will be prpfitable from' the start. The
railway, from Skagway to the Upper Yukon is said
to have paid for itself in a single season. ( That, of
course, .was due to, the exceptional rush of business
to supply the miners in the Klondike, and a repeti
tion of the success cannot be counted on elsewhere.
Nevertheless a line that will; bring therrich gold re
gions around Nome into closer communication with
the outer, world -will be almost certain to pay ' even
tually. 'Â¦Â¦ -There is the further prospect that the con
struction of, the road would lead to. the development
of gold fields elsewhere and would' thus make busi
ness for itself at many points.
The introduction of the bill is an evidence that
large capitalists are ready to engage-in the task of de
veloping the Territory. The construction of such a

may ask. Is not this liberty, however well up

liable to run into rank individualism ? , ; It
must be admitted that such a concern is not
without Justification. In periods of transition
there are : always men who go too far.
The fact that two congregations of the
Protestant Episcopal church : do not have their

itself .is not a reproach; it' Is a simple ex
hibition of the workings of the liberty which
is given, to the church: 1 'And if just now these

How far such a policy would be acceptable to the
party at large remains to be seen. Were it proposed
in a Democratic caucus at Washington it would cer
tainly lead to a bitter factional fight, for there are a
good many "imperialists" among the Southern 'rep
resentatives., who are by no means willing, to release
pur hold upon the islands. Indeed sorne,oi them are
Â¦ in favor of annexing Cuba Itself. _ v The. opinions , of
these men,', however, "-are likely^ t0 *bc .'overruled by.
thft necc^ity of formulating some sort of an issue, on
which to oppose the adminiÂ«tration, and at present
the Philippine question is about the only one ttet
presents itself as an available issue. It is' true there
has been much talk of a fight on the question of "as
set currency ,"and there is a bare possibility that the
controversy concerning the isthmian canal route may
become a party question. Those, however, are mere
possibilities, not probabilities. The time is at hand
for the Democratic leaders to formulate a policy on
which to ask the confidence of the people at the Con
gressional elections next fall, and at present, while
the Philippine issue doesn't promise much, it prom
ises more than anything else. ' "
BY slight degrees and by a slow and tortuous
process the Democrats of Congress seem to
be developing for their party a programme of
action with respect to the Philippine Islands. .It is
r.ot as yet a 'dearly- defined programme, and probably
no definite programme could be fashioned which
would be acceptable to all factions of that confused
party, but none the less it will probably grow into
shape through evolution and be accepted by th'e
Democracy of the country as an inevitable conse
quence of its position as the party of opposition to
the administration.
- As presented by some of the leading Democrats,
both in the Senate and in the House, the programme
will be to treat the Philippines in much the same
way as it is proposed to treat Cuba. Congress will
be asked to formally relinquish any claim to sov
ereignty over the Philippines. The islands will be
established aj foreign territory having an indepen
dent government but under a temporary protec
torate of the United States. By the passage of the
proposed act the Filipinos will have no rights as citi
zens of the United States nor any privilege of free
dom of trade. The United States will do nothing
more in the islands than reserve to itselt a naval sta
tion, promote the establishment of stable government
and guarantee their independence. Â¦

SCENE IN THE CHURCH OF ST. JOHN THE EVANGELIST WHEN THE BISHOP OF CALIFORNIA WAS
PREACHING THE SERMON THAT PRECEDED THE OPENING OF THE FIFTY-SECOND CONVENTION

-Such'fe the latest suggestion from an authoritative
I source concerning- the ' splution K of r the, , trusUproblem.
ft^s*iflr i^w'nj^r esne^ts^th^b'eg^that has; yet â¢been- "of
fered, but can hardly be aetm^^f^ct^ln^facr;
until further experience with the operation of trusts
has clearly shown in what respects they are injurious
it is hardly worth while to undertake anything like
radical legislation 1 in dealing With them.
Â¦Â¦ Holding, then, the belief that such an act of Con
gress would be constitutional, it is, urged that the
policy should.be attempted at first in an experimental
way by an act permitting corporations engaged in in
terstate commerce to incorporate under national in
stead of State law." This .would leave them free to
do as they choose, and as a consequence those that
came under the law would be friendly to it. Thus a
â¢large amount of antagonism would be eliminated at
the start. In order to encourage corporations to
accept Federal instead of , State incorporation he
would provide by the act that such corporations
should not be subject to taxation under the laws of
any, State except as to property actually situated in
such State. .
Passing to a consideration of the details of a bill
designed to give Congress the exclusive right to deal
with trusts, Mr. Stimson recommends that no attempt
be made to define what constitutes an interstate
commerce corporation. "If you attempt to define,"
he says, "you put the objection right in, the front,
you lose the elasticity of the Supreme Court, 'whicfy
will define for you far better than you, can for your
self, and, finally, any definition narrows the scope of
the law."
After discussing each of the three plans Mr. Stim
son declares in favor of the last. He says: "This
system of national or federal control is distinctly the
most radical and revolutionary of the three courses,
andalso by far the- most effective. If it be constitu
tional, expedient and wise, such an act of Congress
would be a far. more drastic and. complete remedy
obviously than the other two, which are both half
way measures. The constitutionality of such an act
rests on that clause which gives Congress power to
regulate commerce between the States. The Supreme
Court has held that 'this clause covers the instrumen
talities of commerce as well as commerce itself."
The, objections against trusts which are -assumed
at the outset, 01 the report are that large aggrega
tions of capital are destructive of individual initiative;
their power is a menace to politics; they tend to be
come a monopoly and they destroy private enterprise
by unfair competition. Three methods have' been
proposed for regulating such combinations 'and pre
venting their evil effects-first, stricter /anti-trust
legislation by the States _ and by v the" Federal Gov
ernment without; altering the -present relations be
,tween their respective jurisdictions; second,' to have
Congress release to the States its interstate jurisdic
tion; so far as to allow the States themselves to regu
late 1 manufacturing or trading corporations engaged
in interstate commerce; third, to. have, the National
Government take to itself a larger and perhaps exclu
sive control of all such corporations, regulating by
act of Congress all that do any business across State
lines.' ' â¢ â¢
FJ. STIMSON, advisory counsel of the-Indus
trial has"; submitted to that body,
â¢ a careful: study of the trust problem and of
the various means which have' been suggested- for
solving it. His discussion. is of course carried on
from the standpoint of a lawyer. \ He concerns him
self in no wise with the question whether trusts are
or are not injurious from an economic point of view,
but devotes his study to a. consideration of the legal
issues involved in dealing with them under our con
stitution.
THE TRUST PROBLEM,
An Uakland Judge lias- made a most serious assault
on the .vested rights of the male of the human spe
cies. This learned jurist makes the astounding de
cision that awife has the same liberty as a husband
to stay out nights and keep knowledge of her where
abouts' to herself.
Mr. Cleveland closes the remarkable letter with a
pathological remark to the effect that if we do not
give Cuba free trade "our embrace of her means the
contagion of deadly disease." Â¦ Let us draw the cur
tain, with the remark that the less said about that
One can see the victory in the eyes of the ex-
President when he returned to the subject of sugar.
He wanted free sugar in the Wilson tariff and had
promised it to the country, but Gorman outheld him
and amply protected raw sugar, with a differential on
refined that was quite up to the Republican idea of
protection. For that reason Cleveland refused to
sigh the bill and returned it to the House blighted by
his curse, in a message denouncing it, as "merely a
record of shame and dishonor." Yet it had enough
free trade in it to ruin the county, but. as it had no
free sugar it failed to command his approval. Writ
ing now upon sugar again he returns to the old in
vective, saying of the- arguments against free trade
with Cuba, 'Their source and the agencies of their
propagation and spread cannot fail to be recognized
by every honest, patriotic citizen with shame and
humiliation." We hope that the _ Republican free
traders \vill : paste that in their hats and, frequently
reading it, remember that it applies to every Repub
lican argument for protection as much as to sugar.
The members of his own party, who have had no
leader since they deserted him, are in an equally em
barrassing position. As free-traders they stand for
Cuba against their own country. They can see no
merit in giving the profit of raising sugar to Ameri
can farmers, but find the highest principle in giving
it to Cuban planters. The' password of free trade is
"Poverty at home, prosperity abroad." But these
Democrats, who . have squirmed . and wiggled and
wriggled out of Mr. Cleveland's leadership, and who
for very hate of him have even been willing to sup
press their free trade instincts in the last two Presi
dential campaigns, suddenly find themselves under
his leadership again and unable to escape it. They
may pray toward Nebraska, but they must march to
the order of New Jersey.
The Republicans who have been affirming our
duty to make Cuba prosperous raising sugar, rather
than make our own people prosperous by raising it at
home, will find themselves now under Mr. Cleve
land's orders, and must hay-foot and straw^foot at
the . command of their new captain. And 'all the
world will wonder why those who obey him now op
posed.and denounced him in 1887 and until the close
of his last term.- He has not changed. He shows
absolutely Bourbon inflexibility. Therefore they
must have changed. â¢â¢ .
In a letter to Mr. Farquhar of York, Pa.,,in
answer to an inquiry about the demand of Cuba. for
free trade, the ex-President warmly, indeed vehe
mently, indorses that demand, declaring that it in
volves "considerations of morality and conscience
that cannot be ignored." With the true spirit of the
free-trader he says that "the arguments used in oppo
sition to the tariff concessions Cuba implores, based
upon our own material interests, are fallacious, mis
taken and misleading." It will be remembered that this
was exactly the tone of his message in 1887. It was
written in disregard of the claim that our material
interests depend at all upon protection, and it re
quires no miracle of memory to recall what happened
when that principle of his message was put into oper
ation during his second administration. Our material
interests were stricken into disappearance, and be
came, in fact, just as immaterial as he seems to think
they are now.
i|> r R. CLEVELAND has the quality; of f per
j\l\ sistence and judgment as to time foÂ» show
1 i JL ing it to a degree not excelled by -any other
American statesman. The Republican protectionists
who have been teaching the country recently' that
protection is not a stable and scientific economic
principle, but a rule-of-thumb expedient, subject to
relaxation, fluctuation or abolition, whenever senti
mental considerations require, will be pleased to find
themselves under Mr. Cleveland's leadership and
placed in an attitude of approbation of his tariff mes
sage of- 1887. He is a free-trader on principle, and
with the steady zeal of a doctrinaire is ready to seek
what he wants. by the action of either party. .In the
Cuban tariff issue he sees his opportunity and uses
it with the promptness of a skillful leader.

The board has no power to suspend a teacher
from service end pay merely because charges
have been presented against - such teacher. A
suspension under such i conditions during the
term of Us existence is a pro , temcore dis
missal of the teacher from the department,
and by a succession of charges a teacher might
without trial be permanently deprive.! of both
office and salary. The State law confers no
such power upon the board and the charter
by implication denies it.
Upon this question authorities are conflicting
and equally balanced, but. Steadmac. ln his
work on public officers, holds against the
power. The Superior Court may remove or
suspend an educator for ma'.performance of the
duties of his trust, but the power of suspen
ricn is expressly conferred by legislative act.
The charter - authorizes the Board of Educa
tion to â¢"dismiss" teachers, but it confers no
authority in terms to suspend them, while it
does invest the Board of Police. Commissioners
with power to dismiss and also to suspend a
police officer In certain events. 1 It also author
izes the Mayor in certain cases and in respect
to certain officials to suspend an officer against
whom charges have been preferred.
In giving his opinion Judge Hunt sail:
Judge Hunt decided yesterday that the
Board of Education has no power to sus
pend a teacher against whom charges
have been preferred pending a trial on the
charges. He gave this opinion yesterday
in overruling the demurrer Interposed by
the board to the suit brought by Miss M.

Generals Schalk-Burger and Botha are

and PiesICerrr-Steyn still Insist upon "In

fopBUie.-ed- hopeless to arrive any
agreed ;Â«sis of negotiations,-- Fi-:c;-. .
Referring to this matter editorially, the
Daily News draws the inference that the
Govsrnment has already replied and has
reveled the Dutch overtures as unauthor
ized, as otherwise Batfous svonW not have
been Jn a position to promise the papers
on iJie.subiectv-tijis promise- showing that
no further negotiations were afoot.
Ihitch Overtures Rejected.
Dr. Bisschop had long conferences with
the Boer delegates on the Continent, with
the exception of Kruger. But he was as
sured that the ex-President had dele
gated his authority and that it was not
necessary to see him.
According to the paper. Dr. Bisschop
persuaded the delegates to hold a confer
ence and discuss the proposals. Then fol
lowed the visit of Dr. Kupyer to London.
The Daily News declines to reveal the
outcome of these conferences, but practi
cally avows that the Boer delegates still
Insist upon Independence, and it is said
that the Government ought to reply, set- i
Ting forth Great Britain's terms ar.d leav
ing the responsibility of a refusal to the
Eoers.
The Daily News this morning claims
credit for the initiation of the peace move
ment. This* paper says that after Lord
Rosebery's speech at Chesterfield it
sent Dr.' Bisschop, who was recently
counsel for the Dutch Government before
the compensation committee and who js
neither Briton nor Boer, on a mission to
the Continent to invite the Boer delegates
to a consideration of the basis of negotia
tions which Lord Rosebery suggested,
namely, to grant the Boers self-govern
ment on the Canadian model; Â»> unneces

Initiation, of Peace Movement.
The Petit Bleu of Brussels, the organ
of the Krugerltes. flatly denied last night
that the Boer delegates had charged any
one to make peace proposals and pro
fessed to be In entire ignorance of the
Dutch proposition.
The Hague correspondent of the Daily
Mail claims to have ascertained that Dr.
LteyCs inspired the Dutch Foreign Secre
tary, who was further advised by Pro
lessor Aszer, the international jurist, and
Adds that Dr. Leyds, the European rep
resentative of the Transvaal, is apparent
ly attempting to draw Chamberlain, the
British Colonial Secretary, to disclose the
terms conditional upon the waiving of In
dependence.
It is recalled that Dr. Kuyper, the
Dutch Premier, in an interview published
about Christmas time, was represented
to have urged the impossibility of Hol
land's intervening in South Africa unless
she had reason to think that both parties
wished it. Consequently it is regarded as
certain that the present move was in
spired by the Boer delegates.
The announcement of Balfour caused
a sensation in the lobbies of Parliament.

Golden Gate Association
Benefits Likely, to Accrue to
the Commerce of San
Francisco.
Adopts Resolutions Asking
Supervisors to Pass
Ordinance.
t At a representative meeting j of tho
Golden Gate Park Driving Association
held last night in the Palace Hotel a
resolution was adopted petitioning tho
Board of Supervisors to pass the ordin
ance that will permit the reopening of
the Ingleside . racetrack. The president
of the association was authorized to ap
point a committee to present the resolu
tion to the .board and all the members
of the_ association are to be requested to
be present ' when the resolution is pre
sented and give their, efforts toward se
curing favorable consideration on thÂ«
part of the board. The resolution calls
attention to the fact that by the reopen
ing of Ingleside large sums of money
that are how spent elsewhere will be put
in circulation in local business circles.
Â» The resolution reads as follows:
Whereas, ' A resolution has been introduced
before the Board of Supervisors by Supervisor
Lynch to authorize racing at Ingleside race
track for a period of sixty days each year: and
Whereas, It is generally recognized that
large sums of money are distributed ' ln trade
channels for supplies, feed, salaries, etc., where
a properly Â¦ equipped racetrack Is maintained;
and' - . .
- Whereas, Owing to the fact that the race
tracks at Oakland and Tanforan are now open
and the racetrack at Ingleside has been closed
for some time, thus depriving the business in
terests of San Francisco of the legitimate dis
bursement of large sums of money Incidental
to maintaining a racetrack. Therefore be It .
Resolved, by the Golden Gate Park Driving
Association, That it is the sense of this or
ganization that the reopening of the racetrack
at Ingleside would .. be beneficial to the busi
ness Interests of San FYanclsco, and that the
Board of Supervisors of the city and county
or San Francisco are respectfully asked to pass
the resolution now before the honorable body
for the reopening of the track at Ingieslde,
and that the president of this association is
hereby authorized to appoint a committee of
three to present these resolutions to the said
Board â¢ of Supervisors, and the secretary Is
hereby requested to notify each member or the
association to be present at the meeting of the
Beard of Supervisors when these ' resolutions
are presented to lend their support and secure
the passage of the resolution above mentioned
at the hands of the honorable Board of Su
pervisors of the city and county of San Fran
cisco - M. M. DONNELLY.

The report j of William M. Bunker, the
Chamber of Commerce representative at
Washington, D. C, has been received by
Secretary "_ Scott. Bunker reviews the
work already" accomplished in behalf of
the commercial interests of California and
sets forth the plan of campaign for the
remainder of the Congressional session.
In reference to the attempt to reduce
the. tariff on imports of sugar and citrus
fruits. from Cuba, Bunker says:
I The advocates of a reduced tariff on Cu^an
sugar have thus far failed to make out a
strong case. Their nrgui-icnt before the Houss
Committee on. Ways and Means was a distinct
disappointment to those asking: a tariff cut.
They failed to prove their claim that a redue
tlon in the tariff on sugar from Cuba would
benefit the Cuban people aa a whole. Their
argument, however, provoked a general discus
sion by 'members and public of sugar anj
Citrus fruit interests, which would be affected
by a reduced tariff. This discussion empha
sized the fact that tariff reductions through the
proposed reciprocity treaties would be in tha
main , at the expense of California. Tho con
stant "reiteration of this, fact and the dtetri
bution among members of Congress of litera
ture showing the citrus fruit output of the
State have had an excellent effect. In stating
my belief that none of the reciprocity treaties
will pass Congress I am voicing the sentiment
of Senators and Congressmen â¢ whose judgment
is to-day the best available guide.'
In reference to the proposed new Cus
tom-house for San Fraricjgco, he says:
Senator Perkins has introduced' into the Sen
ate the bill for a new , Custom-house, which
passed the Senate last year' and, as remarked
already, was not reported from the House
Committee on- Public Buildings. Copies of
these bills have been sent to the chamber. The
necessity for a new Custom-house is S3 ob
vious that if any appropriation Â¦ be made for a
new RUblie building- Sari Francisco can hardly
fall to 'get the desired j Custom-house appro
priation. The building project is viewed with
favor by the Public Building Committee of
each novae.
Bunker also reports that, .at the in
stance of Congressman Metcalf. he has
placed with the Rivers and Harbors Com
mittee of the House the resolutions of the
Chambers of Commerce of San Francisco
and Vallejo advocating a ship channel
through San Pablo Bay and Mare Island
Strait. The documents were accompanied
by an argument based on facts and fig
ures furnished by parties interested ln the
project He further states that there is
little question but that the Government
will approve of the . establishment of a
direct steamship line to Manila.
Bunker reports that he has been In,con
ference with William A. Jones, Commis
sioner of Indian Affairs, and that as a
result Ban Francisco will be .given an
opportunity to bid for, furnishing supplied
to the Indian Department in the future.

"So during tho whole summer he drank
Postum, thinking It was etrong coffee, and
we could all see, from day to day, how
much he was Improving in health. His
complexion gradually cleared up, and he
gained in every way. When he went back
in the fall mother told him the secret she
had kept for over three months, and put
several packages of Postum in his trunk.
"When he cams home from college last
summer he was thin and looked dread-

and drink. He said he drank <*offee. 'Of
course I can't get along without a good
cup of coffee three times a day.' Mother
Â¦ did not cay anything to him, but made
Postum for him just the came, and at the

Hides, ; Tallow, Wool and Hops.
With the exception of Tallow, which con
tinues scarce andiin demand, everything under
this head Is quiet and unchanged. There I3 a
steady call for the few Hops still left In grow
ers' hands, but the growers are exacting top
prices. Hides move off fairly, but the Eastern
markets have been quieter and weaker of late.
There is not enough good Wool coming In to
make a market worth talking about and what
few choice clips come In are taken up as soon
as they appear.
An Oregon paper says that the accepted es
timate of the 1901 yield of Hops in that State
up to. the last week or two. -was 65.000 bales'
It now transpires that no less than 71 000
bales were grown in Oregon last year. Or thiÂ«
crop about 56.C0O bales .have -- been ahlDDeVl
away. Of the remaining 15.000 bales about
10.000 are In railroad warehouses. The East
Side warehouse of the Southern Pacific con
' tains about oOOO bales.". Most of this quantity
Is In. the control of speculating dealers whi
are holding for higher prices. The amount in
the hands of growers is estimated to be h"
, tween 2000 and 8000 bales. * The largest acp.il
mulatlons of Hops other thaw at ;Portlanri or.

Quotations for Raisins are dropped, and It
is uncertain when they will reappear. Some
operators think, they will not be seen again
until the new crop comes In, as there arc
only about 100 cars left' at Fresno, and they
are tied up by the dispute between the asso
ciation and the packers. They are held by
the association, and nobody'; else' has any.
Raisins, bid fair to be a scarce, article later on. .
~ Fruits, though" rather quiet, are extremely

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. Jan. 28. â A successful turn
waÂ» made against. the shorts in to-day's sti>ck
market. How far the demand for Etocks rep
resented new buying frcm outside sources can
. oftly bÂ». conjectured. Conditions wliit-h were
made the ground for selling yesterday remained
unaltered to-day without affecting the strong
tendency toward recovery. The weakness la
the eraih markets, which yesterday waa made
thÂ« basis of rumors of financial troubles, was
turned to a bull argument to-day ' as showing
good conditions for the winter wheat crop.
The formulation by the United Mine Workers
of flat demands for higher wages which de
prersed the coalers yesterday was ignored to
day. The poor knowing for December of Erie
and the Reading syetems were Ignored and
these stocks were quite conspicuous for activity
and strength. It is thought that part of the
recent gelling of coalers has been In anticipa
tion of this showing and that to-day's buying
was' short covering. These vagaries of senti
ment indicate the professional character of the
trading. The most important influence of the
advance wag the stimulating effect of the re
covery of three more points in Amalgamated
Copper. The dealings in this ptock were almost
twice as great as those In any one'stock. The
further advance In raw copper and the heavy
buying in London were taken to indicate that
large sums have been left uncovered, waiting
for the price to touch bottom. The advance
in Amalgamated was taken by speculators to
indicate a sentiment In favor of an advance by
thÂ» Standard OH party, which has long been
supposed to favor quietude In speculation
Coupled with a published utterance cf J. P,
Morgan, expressing confidence in . the main
tenance of the country's prosperity, the effect
was to impress speculators with ths idea that
the great financial powers were again In ac
cord in favoring higher prices for stocks. The
upward movement broadened and gained force
up to the close, which was at about the best
and strong. The reported agreement to main
tain rates among Western railroads and meat
packers was a strengthening influence. The
speculation In Sugar was based on the ex
pectation of an advance in the production and
bad an important sympathetic effect. The
â¢statement in the British House of Commons
that a note from the Dutch Government is un
der consideration, presumably bearing op over
tures for peace from the Boers, helped the
closing streneth In the market..
The bond market was strong and individual
bonds were not bo overwhelmingly conspicuous
' as of late. Total sales, par value, $4,385,000.
United States -bonds were all unchanged on
tlrt last call. .. . Â¦.-.Â¦Â¦

The Weather and Crops.
â¢ The weekly report of A. G. McAdle, section
director of the climate and crop service of the
"Weather Bureau, is as follows: .
GENERAL SUMMARY. .
Cool weather has jÂ»Â«vaU*d throughout, *ihÂ«
(state Curing thÂ« week,, with killing frosts in
nearly all section* Sunday and Monday morn
ings. Rain has fallen in all parts of the State,
with heavy enow in the mountain districts. , In
some sections the temperature Is : reported the
lowest of the season. . Â¦
â¢j h.j cor.diiicn.of {rain has been greatly im
proved by the rainfall. (Facially in the south,
and the cold weather has had -no Injurious ei -
ltct txcept in retarding the growth of. train and
green feed. Prospects continue good for heavy
omtÂ» of wheat and barley in the central and
northern districts, and ate much better in the
couth than during the past month. In some
sections farmers are increasing the acreage of
grain and plowing and 'seeding are progressing
rapidly. Pasturage is becoming more plentiful
and block are in good condition. Warmer
weather would be beneficial to all crops.
The low temperatures and killing frosts at
the close of the week have undoubtedly caused
some injifry to citrus fruits in Southern Call
lornia. although no reports of damage have
been received. Ample warnings jrere given, .
and the orchards protected by smudging have
probably escaped with comparatively little in-
Jury. Vineyards and orchards continue in good
condition and pruning is progressing. , DccUu
eua fruit prospects are excellent.' â¢
SACRAMENTO VALLEY. -
fold weather has prevailed during the week.
with frequent rains and killing frosts. There
has been a heavy fall of snow in the mountains.
The cold north wind on Saturday was followed
by freezing temperatures Sunday and Monday
mornings, causing Borne damage to garden
truck, green feed and tender wheat shoots.
Plowing was letarded by me frequent showers,
but grain, pasturage at.d orchards were bene
fited. Grain continues In ;."iod condition and a
heavy crcp is predicted. Orchards and vine
yards are doing well and fruit prospects con
tinue excellent. . Â«
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.'
Rain during the week has greatly benefited
grain and pasturage, especially in the southern
coast counties, and has enabled farmers to re
curae plowing and seeding. There is consider-'
able snow in the mountains. Cold north winds
prevailed Saturday In some sections, and killing ;
1 rosts occurred Sunday and Monday mornings
In many places, but no reports of serious Injury
have been received. Grain is In very good con
dition, though making slow growth, and would
be benefited by warm weather. Pasturage Is
plentiful and stock are In good condltiou. Trait
prospects are excellent in all sections. In the
vicinity of Santa Rosa a large acreage* of new
vineyards and orchards is being planted.
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.
Conditions have been more favorable for crops
than for several weeks. Rain has fallen In all
parts of the valley, reviving grain and pastur
age and softening the eoil for cultivation.
Enow has fallen in the mountain districts. Se
vere frosts have occurred In some sections, but
no -damage has been done except in retarding
the growth of grain and green feed. Crop pros
pects are greatly Improved, and with favorable
conditions through the spring the yield of wheat
end'barley should be nearly average. Warmer
weather and light 6howers would be very bene
ficial. Plowing and seeding are progressing
and considerable work is being done in orchards
and vineyards. Fruit prospects are excellent.'
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ' Â«
Cooler weather has t prevailed during the
wecH. and eevere frosts have occurred in nearly
all sections. The generous rainfall has-been of
immense benefit ttÂ» all croi>s and has softened
the soil sufficiently for cultivating in' fields and
orchards. In some localities early sjwn grain
will probably make a fair crop, and the crain
acreage will be increased. Pssturage has be
come plentiful In most section* and rtock are
doini? well. Orchards and vineyards are Jn good
condition.- The severe frosts at the dose of the
veek fnjured unprotected, citrus fruits, but as
cmple warnings had been given it is probable
the damage will be light.
EUREKA SUMMARY.
. Rain and cold weather greatly Interfered with
farm work and growing crops, which are mak
ing very slow growth. LowteraperatUKS are
preventing premature budding. .No damage by \
tioKt reported. jT TOPI. r< f iMM TOi

Chicago opened steady, with a moderate de
mand, chiefly to fill shorts. All other mar
kets were weak, being affected by the depres
sion In coarse grains. Oklahoma wired: "No
rain or snow of any benefit to wheat, and
many farmers will plow over their land for
other crops." New York reported foreign or

mostly local. A good deal of long wheat came

CHICAGO, Jan. 28.â The grain pits took
their cues' from oats to-day, which still, held
the center of Interest. Oats were nervous and
fluctuations were wide nearly all the session.
May options started a shade higher on light
offerings and under the influence of an appar
ent absence of the terrible pressure that nearly
brought . collapse yesterday. May even sold up
to 42%c, but then country, holders turned lib
eral sellers. Many longs with small margins
were pressed by calls for heavier margins at
the opening and some of these were shaken
out. This brought a break for May down to
40c. Support then developed. There â¢ wa3 also
considerable covering on the breaks and the
putting out of the .short lines on the slight
advances. May soon reacted to 42c and closed
easy %c down, i Gossip on the board to-day
had it that yesterday's furore was due to the
shaking out of a prominent Kansas City oper
ator, who was long about 1,500,000 bushels of
May. oats. After Saturday's break of lc the
commission houses that, were .handling this
man's line began calling for margins. There
was no response and the- first thing at the
opening they began belling out a line to pro
tect themselves. This brought on the fear
of Patten selling and the break resulted. The
Kansas City operator is said not to be in any
danger of failure, having made all of his home
deals. - Â¦ ' l . ',
Wheat had a fairly good business. There
was little in the way of news of importance
and the ups and downs = of prices were due to
local conditions. Cables were slightly . lower
and: the world's visible eupply showed a good
decrease. There *â¢ was rain in the Southwest,
which gave courage- to the -bears, but it was
the oats dip that brought the â¢ principal fluc
tuations in this pit. The comparative firm
ness of the coarse grains at the opening had
helped wheat materially. May " opened un
changed to lUc higher at 77%'@77%c and even
touched 7Sc, but when corn and oats began to
dip May sold down to V7%@77 1 / 4c. Wheat re
covered and advanced to a steady close, May
unchanged at 77%c r
Corn started out strong, broke sharply with
oats, but later showed -a tendency to hold up
well. May closed steady,' unchanged at t>0%@
COTsc. '
ProvUions were fairly active and somewhat
nervous. The temporary > weakness . in grains
brought a slump in pork. May pork closed
12'/Â£c down, lard 5@7i4c off Â«ind ribs 5c lower.

"The market for raisins, with *peclal refer
ence to the stocks held on the coast, is unset
tled. Rumcrs are afloat that the deal with the
packers and association is off and that a single
interest has bid for the holdings. Spot is some
what quiet, though fairly firm pending price
developments frcm the coast. London layer

"In prunes the feellr.r is temporarily quiet on

Think Plunger Is Broke.
The general sentiment in sporting circles
last night was that Lewis had "gone
broke" and that he hoped to make a "kill
ing" on Lass of Langdon and If the filly
had won and no investigation had been
made as to his credit at the bank, on
which he had drawn checks, he would
have continued to pose as a "prosperous
plunger."
The penalty mefed out. by racing asso
ciations for an attempt to defraud' the
bookmakers is warning off the turf.
Danny Lynch stated last night that he
knew nothing of Lewis'- transactions in
giving Dwyer a "phony" check for $5000.
"He came to me last week," said Lynch,
"and J gave him information that he fol
lowed and he won big money. I thought
that my filly, Lass of Langdon, would win
and told Lewis so. She would have done
so if she had not got the worst of it at
the start." : . - - ?
General Manager Price of the New Cali
fornia Jockey Club stated last night that
he was busily engaged in examining the
sheets of the bookmakers and would re
port to the racing stewards to-day. Price
stated that in justice to all parties con
cerned he was unable to give out any
information as to Lewis' conduct in the
betting ring.
Regarding ,his "markers," Lewis in
formed Price that they would ; be made
good to-day by Ellis of the firm, of Ellis
& Stanfield, who have a stable at Oakland
track.
General Manager Price sent to the
bookmakers for their sheets and the doc
uments disclosed no record of any sucn
cash transactions as Lewis claimed to
have made on Lass of Langdon. When
pressed Lewis admitted that he gave' the
check to Dwyer to place on Lass of Lang
don in outside pool rooms in order
to get a good price. He ; confessed
that he â¢ had no money . in the
bank on which the '$5000 check was
drawn, 'but vouchsafed no explanation as
to! how he intended to meet the voucher.
Lewis tried to make an excuse to General
Manager Price by saying that he did not
expect to get ' a fair deal and' did not
think that Dwyer would "put the money
up as directed in the poolrooms on Lass
of Langdon. .

ment to General Manager Price, and to
that official the plunger claimed that he
had stopped the check he had given to
Dwyer to place on Lass of Langdon. He
gave his reason for this act that he had
discovered that he was to be "jobbed" by
certain parties. Lewis asserted that he
had placed $2500 in cash on the filly and
admitted his Indebtedness on "markers"
to the extent of $1500. ;

When George Rose, the bookmaker,
was offered a check by Lewis, drawn on
the Western National Bank of San Fran
cisco, Rose telegraphed the bank to find
out something as to Lewis' credit. The
reply was that Lewis had no funds on
deposit at the bank. Rose informed the
other bookmakers and Joe Dwyer, who
had placed bets for $5000 in other cities
on behalf of Lewis, at- once counter
manded his commissions.
The young plunger was told on all sides
that his checks would not be accepted
and that cash was required. Some of the
bookmakers, having faith In Lewis, ac
cepted his "markers" or "credit" bets on
Lass of Langdon to the extent of $1500.

at 3 to 1 and went back to 6 to L In a

Lewis' career was ended for , the day
when he was unable to redeem his mark
ers for $1500. His transaction in giving
Dwyer a check for $5000, when he had no
funds to meet it at the bank on which
it was drawn, was the topic of conversa
tion and soon' came to the ears of tne
stewards of the racing association.
Lewis was called upon to make a statt-

its members cannot be said to have either
usurped or Intruded into any public office or
to unlawfully hold or exercise such office. The

tion of a city and provision for the health of
Its inhabitants are. as is shown in the opinion
of Mr. Justice Temple, eminently a "municipal
affair," and the establishment of a Board of
Health which shall have the management and
control of that "affair" is an appropriate pro
vielon of a municipal charter. To the extent
that the provisions of the charter upon this
subject are within this "municipal- affair," to
that extent the Board of Health created by the
charter Is rot an illegal body, whether any of
the provisions of the charter upon this subject

commitment from San Francisco to the
State hospital his case was diagnosed as
"religious mania." â¢ .. -.:.-,,â¢,

starting toward the woman with the
pistol.
"Don't you step forward an inch, or I
will kill you," was the firm order from
the determined woman. ...
Again he was quieted and renewed his
tramp, not disturbing the family again
until 7:30 o'clock in the morning. This
time Mrs. Schaffer responded. Armed
with a pistol she went to the door -and
aiming the weapon at the caller ordered
him to depart. ,

The Schaffers were aroused at 2 o'clock-
Saturday morning by violent thumping on
the front door. The startled husband
arose and went to the door. He fou.ict
Coons there demanding admittance. The
uncanny visitor angrily declared the
Schaffers .were concealing his wife from
him.
"I must have her," he shrieked In his
maniacal rage.
Â¦ Schaffer realized that the caller was not
in his right mind and tried to pacify him.
After half an hour's effort Coons departed
and began to walk around the house. For
two hours he tramped bareheaded and
then suddenly renewed his attack upon
the Schaflers' residence.
Detectives Shorey and Holland spent the
greater part of the day In an investiga
tion of Coons' history since he has been
in Oakland. Ample evidence of his insan
ity was uncovered. Only last Saturday
night Coons was held at bay by a deter
mined .woman, armed with a pistol, and
.prevented from entering her house in
search of the wife his unbalanced mind
had imagined was hidden from him. The

Mr. Hofmann' s best number,- by long
odds, was the "Tannhauser" â¢ overture,
given with symphonic grasp. â¢ The Lizst
"Gnomenreigen' was a pretty little tech
nical wonder. Schumann's "Nachstucke"
and the Chopin "Prelude" (No. 25) were
tonally very beautiful, and the "Soiree de
Vienne" was given with sensational effect.
The "Appassionata" sonata betrayed the
thin place in â¢- the pianist's equipment.
Large in plan, and with all the logical
grip necessary for the Interpretation of
Beethoven, sympathy was almost wholly
lacking,- the epic passion and' tenderness
almost wholly lost. It .was toot "Mr. Hof
mann's, but the instrument's, fault, that
the repeated notes in the first movement
of the sonataâ and even in the little "Va
riations" .of Haydnâ were deficient in
clearness, and there | was much technical
splendor in the rendering. But, barring in
the "Tannhauser," . the pianist has not
yet done his best work, and the. Friday
recital is likely to show wonders yet . un
revealed.
As an artist Hofmann stands alone. He
does not disturb the supremacy of Go
dowsky, master poet and technician;' nor
the exquisite witchery of Paderewskl's
art; nor. the huge,; warm, colorful magic
of Carreno's effort; nor again the co
lossal technical magnificence of. Rosen
thai. He "has a cool, clear,, logical point
of view, â¢ a brilliant technique, ; a lucent
tone, a marvelous poise and balance that
almost, but not quite, take the place of
spontaneity, together with a faculty of
outlining and massing the features of a
composition -with j superb .certainty. . But
his voice/ lacks . magnetismâ yet lacks
poetry, tenderness. For to-morrow, with
its light and mystery, who knows?
Yet another of the great pianists of- the

In San Francisco, v Josef Hofmann'made
his first appearance here yesterday after
noon at the Columbia Theater and ; not
since Paderewski's day has so large j an
audience greeted a pianist as that which
welcomed the young virtuoso. . The enthu
siasm, until toward the end of .the pro
gramme, was rather on the. temperate or
der, which, however, was neither Mr. Hof
mann's nor the ; audience's . fault. The
young virtuoso's piano failed to put in
an appearance until after the recital and
the substitute instrument, variously bad,
succeeded in putting a damper on the
artist's mood and consequently on the au
dience's enjoyment. ; But Mr. \ Hofmann
came to, his own toward the close of
the programme, and in spite of the thin,
flat tone and uncertain action of his inf
strument, achieved a splendid triumph in
the "Tannhauser" overture. â¢; .
Perhaps the young maestro reminds
more of Godowsky than of \ any. other
pianist that we have had here. . -There is
the same delightful â¢ lack of affectation
that distinguished that greatest of the
piano-playing fraternity, tne same simple
and modest manner and entire absence of
anything approaching eccentricity. He

any but a thoroughly legitimate popular
ity. His twenty-four' years and world

Justice Harrison, with whom Justice
Garoutte concurs directly, also writes a
concurring opinion. He cays in part as
follows:
I concur in affirming the judgment. The
Question of Usurpation.
Justice McFarland concurs, but denies
that the public health ia a "municipal af
fair," holding that the city can take ac
tion without interfering with the general
laws.
Chief Justice Beatty and Justice Hen-Â«
shaw concur directly with Justice Tem
ple. Justice Van Dyke writes a concur
ring opinion In which he emphasizes the
stand taken by Justice Temple that a
city should be clothed with great power
to deal with matters pertaining to tne
health of its inhabitants.
Former Board Not Considered,
The attorneys for Dr. Lawlor contend
that. If a law, the charter cannot bÂ« re
pealed, amended or interfered with by
the Legislature, and thus prevents the
Etate from protecting the public health.
San Francisco, it is said, is our prin
cipal seaport and likely to receive from
abroad persons affected â¢with infectious
diseases and who are a source of danger
to the entire population of the State. In
reference to this point the court says:
â¢'We must presume. If these provisions
are valid, that in creating the charter
and making it sv law the people have
adopted the means In their judgment
likely to protect the people of the State
from such dangers. Nor is the charter a
law which cannot be amended. It was
made and can be amended as the people
have ordained In the organic law."
Justice Temple, who renders the opin
ion, says in dosing:
As I have said, we have in thi* case nothing
to do with the former board. We are neither
required nor authorized to determine In" this
case whether such board still continued in ex
ittence, or, if it does still exist, what powers
and functions are left to it. The charter
beard certainly has some of the powers which
the charter confers upon It, and if to any ex
tent UiÂ« code sections creating the former
board are Inconsistent with the valid grant of
power conferred by ths charter to that extent
they are superseded by the charter.
This board with its functions being In Us
nature an â¢affair" appropriate for a municipal
ity and being actually contained In the char
ter, is a "municipal affair" within any mean-
Ing heretofore given to the phrase "municipal
atair." The suggestion that an "affair" al
ready existing under the laws of the State
and 'or the t^eople generally. Including the In
habitants of the city, cannot be made a munic
ipal â¢'anair," does not seem to me to merit
discussion. The charter supersedes all laws
inconsistent therewith. I do not wish to in
timate a doubt as to the entire validity of
the charter provlstone on this subject, but for
the purposes of this case It is not necessary
to decide whether some of Its provisions are not
void because inconsistent with the code pro
vision*. If there is anything which the char
ter board can lawfully do the -city may mala
tala U. Â¦ Â¦ . â¢. :
It U evident that the powers conferred upon
and the duties required of this board are
etrlctly municipal in their character. All that
It required of the board Is peculiarly for the
inhabitants of the city and not directly for
the benefit of any one else. As to some of
the functions of the board, a charter, which
did not In eonie way provide for them, directly
or indirectly, by permitting the legislative
body of the city to make provision, would be
intolerable. It may be safely asserted that
no such charter exists and that all that is
here provided for is usually provided or per
mitted in the charters of large cities.
Duties Strictly Municipal.
The court, after the comparison of the
powers conferred on each board, makes
the following; comment:
The board eh&Il have the management and
control of the City and County Hospital, Alms
houses, ambulance service, municipal hospital!-,
receiving hofpit&ls and of ail matters pertain
ing to the preservation, promotion ind pro
tection of the lives and health of the Inhab
itant* of the city and county; and It may de
termine the nature and character of nuisances
i.:id provide lor their abatement. It shall have
the t-a Hilary supervision of the municipal in
ttitutions of the city and county, including
jails, sehoolhouses and all public buildings;
of the disposition of the dead, of the disposi
tion of garbage, offal and other offensive sub
stances.
The Supreme Court decided unanimous
ly yesterday that the Mayor of San
Francisco and not the Governor of Cali
fornia has the rl^ht to appoint the mu
nicipal board of health. The contest, which
was instituted by Dr. William M. Lawrlor
and which has been In the courts since
he was ousted from the position of
health officer under thÂ« authority ' grant
ed by the new charter, is thus brought to
an end. Dr. J. M. Williamson and the
other members of the municipal health
board who have been defendants in the
protracted litigation are assured -of their
rightful occupancy of the contested office.
It was held by Lawlor that the May
or's appointees were usurping the func
tions of the San Francisco Board of
Health in that the provision for their ap
pointment in the charter was unconstitu
tional. The old board consisted of the
Mayor and four physicians, the latter be
ing appointed by the Governor. The
health officer for the City and County of
Ban Francisco was elected by Its mem
bers and was removable at Its pleasure.
The board could appoint * quarantine
officer and prescribe his duties and the
duties of masters of vessels entering the
harbor. It could make vaccination com
pulsory and provide hospitals. The mem
bers of the board were held to be State
officers.
The provisions In regard to the public
health contained In the city, charter are
in z>art as follows:

MINES AND MIXING.
WASHINGTON MINES ARB GOOD MINE8^
WASHINGTON MINES ARE GOOD MINES.
WASHINGTON MINES ARE GOOD MINES.
Washington mines will make moâ Â» money
for shareholders than any others in the West
because of:
Fact 1 â ThÂ» v eres carry high values la Cop-
per, Gold laud Silver.
Fact 2 â The presence on the properties of all
the auxiliaries to successful mining
â timber, water, coal, coke and lime.
Fact 3 â Power for'runningr machinery costs
nothing. Within a year it is said
electric railroads will bo operated
in the Carbon River district by water
_ power.'
Fact 4â Proximity to the seaboard (Copper
King mines are only 45 miles from
the sea at Tacoma) means low
freight expense and correspondingly
larger profits, in addition to the
markets of the world being open to
the mine owner after his stuff is
. aboard ship.
Fact 5â More money is being expended on
Washington mines than on others,
and therefore greater accomplish-
ments are possible. Mining and
allied industries are making tre-
mendous strides in Washington.
Puget Sound beckons to capital, and
capital readily responds. Success Is
sure to attend a company with good
properties, well managed.

Has a magnificent group of 65 claims In tha

Rainier, in which district mine values have
more than doubled during the past year. The
silver content of the ore will alone pay for
working leaving as a profit the value of Jthe

The values known to exist in the ores of thÂ»
various mines of the Carbon River district
lead the various companies to plan a big
smelter at Montezuma. the new town where
big coal mines are just opened and coking
ovens installed. The central location of the
proposed smelter will make it easy of access
and will enable the mines to handle their ores
at small expense.

Miss Jessie E. St^ne, another daughter
of the injured woman, Is lying critically
ill at Los Angeles, and fears are enter
tained-that the news of her mother's dan
ger may cause Miss Stone's death.
. Though suffering great agony. from her
injuries, Mrs." Stone managed to explain
that she had leaned over a gas stove in
. an effort | to dry her hair, which became
ignited from the heat off the fire, the
flames quickly spreading to her clothing.
"Before I could think," she said, "I was
a mass of fire." ., :
Professor Stone was summoned to the
side of his stricken wife, as was Mrs. N.
P. Cole Jr., a daughter/ who resides at
1716 Pacific avenue. < . . j â¢ â¢Â» Â¦. .

In her apartments at the Van Nuys, 1001
Bush street, yesterday afternoon Mrs. W.
W. Stone, wife of Professor Stone, prin
cipal of the James Lick Grammar School,
was so severely, burned that her recovery.
Is deemed doubtful." That she did \ not
suffer agonizing death at the time of the
accident is due to the. presence of mind
and cool action of J. S. Starr, proprietor
of the'/.Van ;JJuy&,Â» who;, attracted by the
screama of Mrs. I Stone j rushed to her aid.
In the frenzy of her suffering Mrs. Stone
threw j fierself upon the floor, the flames
from her clothing and -hair igniting the
window curtains and spreading to other
articles in the room. The blaze was ex
tinguished- however, before serious dam
age had been .done. â¢ . ' . Â¦
When '- Starrs arrived , upon i the. spene

Implied understanding that the south

considerations of fairness to keep out of
the race. These suggestions of fairness
In polities addressed to Walter Paiker and
Dan Kevane might have great weight in
persuading them to advise the Governor
to step out of the way. Pardee's candi
dacy will tend to diminish Gage's chances
of getting a bunch of delegates from Ala
meda County, but beyond that it may not
cut njuch of a figure.
The outlook for a good sprinkling of
canlidates for other places is quite en
couraging. This time A. J. Johnston, who
has held the office of State Printer for
twelve years, is bound to have serious op

The Southern California newspapers are
not standing J!i xor Cage. The l>os Aii
ceies Capital, commenting on political
topics, remarks:
The leading politicians, of the RepubM
can party assert that Los Angeles will
be the scene of the sharpest contest be
tween the Gage and anti-Gage forces. It
is common talk that Gage will retire from
the field if he loses the battle in his j own
county.' Ex-Senator Bulla, who appears
to be the leader of the forces now lining
up against the Gage machine, openly es
pouses the cause of Thomas Flint Jr. and
seeks to compress. the fight to a struggle
between Gage and Flint, the present
Governor is earnestly seeking renomina
tion he may decide to lose no time in ac
cepting the gage of battle which Flint
has placed before him. It Is common gbs
sip that the Gage forces, under the' lead
ership of Waiter Parker and Corney Pen
dleton, are not : developing strength in
Los Angeles. The Governor may there
tore be compelled bv roree of events lo
go south ana raliy his lagging supporters.
Senator ir lint nas arranged for another
southern trip, senator Charles M~ Bel
shaw will probably join him in libs A::
geies.
In all likelihood a resolution will' be
passed by the Supervisors directing Me-
Dougald to use the fund to pay back bills.
This -will be done with the proviso that
should the Supreme Court decide that the
fund should have been kept intact an ap
propriation will be made in. the next tax
levy to replace the money. The St. Mary's
Square promoters appear to be in favor
of the plan, especially, as the Board of
Supervisors has incorporated in the jjro
posed bond issue the .feum of $215,000 to
purchase land for the square.
A conference was held yesterday be
tween Mayor' ' Schmitz and Supervisor
Brandenstein,, chairman of the Finance
Committee,- as to a plan whereby the so
called St. Mary's Square fund of $125,000
may be utilized to pay demands incurred
during the fiscal ; year 1S99-1900. It was
j decided to bring the matter before the
board at .'Its' next 'meeting in "order that
action In 'Â¦ the* matter" might t>e taken
forthwith. "''". ' â¢
Auditor^ Baehr and Treasurer McDoug
ald have b:een; investigating the possibil
ity "of utilizing "the'fund named -and they
find that^Jthere is nothing to prevent the
use of ~the money to pay the city's debts.
Former Treasurer' Brooks was served
with a restraining order to prevent him
from paying any demands out of the fund
when suit was. brought by Christian Reis
to compel the, city to buy. fhe land neces
sary for St. Mary's Square. Judge Sea
well decided that the money was not spe
cilically set aside for park purposes and
that it was-a part of the general fund.
An appeal was taken to the Supreme
Court", which "has the- case' under consid
eration. Though Judge Seawell dissolved
the restraining crdor.i Brooks would not
pay demands out of the fund because the
case was appealed. Treasurer McDougaul
knows of no restraining order and he and
Auditor Baehr are desirous of paying reg
istered demands. aggregating $90,000 which
have not . been '.. paid because- the St.
Mary's Square fund was held: up. The
Mayor favors the proposition,' w*ich will
