his bravery in saving the soldier .from

with one ' hand: Three - times he put -it
above his T head. by -the strength of one

him went away wondering.,'.. , Â¦
osity was rife and gossip loud concerning
him. It was finally all solved by a curi
ous passer-by in the Rue Quatres Croches,
who saw through an open entresol a man
putting up dumbbells of great size in the
courtyard beyond.;- The marvelous ' ease
with which he handled them, as also
something; in the outlines 5 and poses of
the man, caused the curious passer-by to
stop and ask of a serving maid ' near by
who" might inhabit the house. -She replied
that, Mons. Alfred Perrier dwelt there
with - his ' family; and. just then a voice
called out, into ': the ; courtyard . from, an
upper window: "Bras de Fer!" It was
thevolce of : the girl.of the Hippodrome,
now his wife. .The passer-by did not wait
for confirmation *of what 'he had already
suspected, but -went and -, spread t it . far

his greatest ability, as a wrestler, had
preferred to set all Paris guessing.
- There came another medal from the
director, of - the Hippodrome in recognition
cf this ability. Following this was an
offer for an engagement with the Clrcque
Prince Imperial, which M. Perrier accept- .

a cry, .rushed across the road, scaled the

tlon of the amphitheater. This was won
dered at until one night, in a tensely ex
citing moment in the bout, when it looked
as though the man in scarlet would gain
and keep his vantage, some one saw
"Bras de Fer" bow his head and make
the charmed sign. His eyes gave one
brief but direct glance toward the east.
There in a lofty seat far from the ring a
plainly clad young woman rose for one
brief second and waved her glove. By a
quick, dexterous grasp "Bras, de Fer"
forced his opponent to his knees. Then
the" interest in the unknown was doubled,
for it was certain that he was no-sor

The common stable fly, or horsefly, is
of three kinds. The large mourning
horsefly is of auriiform black; Â¦ the white
lined fly differs only in dress, being of
the same annoying species; the smaller
golden-headed r horse and. ox flies have
banded wings. The female alone sucks
blood, while the male feeds, daintily upon
flowers. The larvae, however, are car
nivorous.
The mosquito and the black fly we speak
of together because of the equally, pain
ful discomfort of their biter; but zoolog- .
Ically they differ a little. The mosquitoes
are cullcidae, culex being Pliny's name
for the fly. They have feathery anten
nae and a fringe of hair on the hind mar
gin of the wing. The larvae develop on
the surface of stagnant pools. As the
larvae have a respiratory tube open at
the tall end, they rest vertically ' near the
surface of the water, head down and the
tail at the surface, in order to breathe
through that end. The reason they are
killed by pouring kerosene oil over the
water Is that the oil makes a film through
â¢which they cannot breathe, Â¦ which liter
ally smothers them to death. The black
flies, on the other hand, are long-horned
flies, the nematocera. '. What boy In the
Adirondack woods this summer, or in
past summers, has not seen and felt them!
The females alone, like the female mos
quitoes, are the blood-suckers. -The larvae
also live .and develop on the .surface of
the water.
You may ask possibly what good do the
flies and what real harm, or which do
they more than the otherâ good or harm?
The diptera directly and indirectly are. a
nuisance to man, because the horsefly and
the horn fly torment horses and cattle;
the buffalo gnat actually ' kills some bf
the domestic animals, as does the bot
fly; the larvae of some kinds -of flies, in
jure gall gnat, destroy clover and. Its
seed; the Hessian fly does great damage
to wheat and to Indian corn. But we
cannot deny that some of the, diptera
do great good in preying on injurious,in
sects. There is .a! robber fly which at
tacks and devours the common
house fly, . v the stable fly, bumble
bees and dragon . flies. ( The lar
vae of the horseflies are carnivorous;
they prey on many kinds of insect
larvae. Some of the diptera act" as scav
engers. Have you never heard what good
, work is done by the mosquito larvae?
They are scavengers.. We might have the
work done by a pleasanter workman; but
at least give them their due for the only
known benefit they confer., upon the hu
man race. The carrion fly eats deca yinj?
animal matter, * while some diptera - eat
decaying vegetable matter. The crowning
work of all is that of the larvae of flies
which, by; boring into" rotten wood, helj)
make the forest mold. You will not, we
think, find any scientific man who would
dare to say that mankind 7 would be bet
te: off if all the diptera were gone from
the face 'of the earth.-Our Animal

A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT
THE PESKY LITTLE FLY.
<? F there is any living creature that you
I think you know, it is the fly. But
II while you have seen flies, and have
perhaps been tormented by some of
that family this summer, how much do
you really know about them?
" The flies you know best are the house
fly. the stable fly and the mosquito. Their
general family name is dlptera, which is
given as well to other members of the
family, for it is legion. "Diptera" means
twice-wingedâ a term which belongs to all
two-winged Insects. The larvae of the
house fly and of the stable fly are born
in filth, but as soon as they are fully de
\-eloped they soar Into the sunshine and
free air. Only on damp days do they care
to enter houses and stables; for files can
not bear to be out In the -wet. So sensi
tive are they to moisture that they will
go almost anywhere to avoid it. We do
r.ot need to tell you that to drive flies
from the house you should darken the
rooms and give the little creatures a
chance to escape into, the sunshine. They
will avail themselves of it readily enough.
As the flies of which we are speaking de
velop In filth, it is natural that cleanly
human beings should do their best to be
rid of them. Flies swarming upon arti
cles of food are a menace to health, as
any physician will tell you.
To keep to the house fly ana to be^in
at the beginning, we must tell you that it
is one of the short-horned diptera, its
special name of brachycera meaning
short-hern or antenna, because- the an
tennae are short. They are also three
jointed, with the third joint ringed. If
you can look at a common Â¦ house fly un
der the microscope you will at once sec
what we mean.- This fly lays its eggs in
manure cr other filth, and as 100 or 200
eggs are usually laid by a single female,
you see that a mother fly - is very much
like the famous old woman -who lived in
a shoe. In warm weather it takes only a
lew hours for the eggs to hatch in mag
gots or larvae; It takes only a week for
the maggots -to become, full-grown flies;
within, two weeks' they are busy starting
families of their own. , If t..e common fly
had no enemies it would torment mankind
far more than it does. Nature manages,
however, (o keep her balance, even with
Â§a fly. Tiny parasites destroy many of the
larvae before they have half a chance to
develop. In the autumn you will find a
fungous growth choking the life out of
the flies that- it infests. Have you never
found dead flies on the window pane, their
bodies wrapped in an odd sort of winding
sheet rn&de of very fine white threads
; ticking- out in every direction?. If you
iiaven't, you may look for them this au
tumn, and feel that you have learned
something of the tragedy which can come

made a sign that looked like that of tho

serious one for the lad. He dropped from
'the trapeze in which he had been sitting

pared to receive him just above the

in construction, gave way and the young

M. Vanon and others. Here he had a fall

to do so but his partner, M. Vanon. M.

I ny France was called "Bras de Fer,"'
I and whose arms of iron were for
many months the terror of all other
wrestlers who fell because of them at the
Hippodrome. Here he is the proprietor of
a French restaurant in the Latin quarter
and caters to the palates of many of the
most noted bon vivants of San Francisco.
Prior to this he was famous in this city
also for his wonderful feats_ of strength
and skill in wrestling, and was known as
the French Hercules. Woodward's Gar
dens was the scene of some of his most
wonderful and daring exploits. .
The story of how he came by his title of
"Bras de Fer" in Paris is a romantic his
tory, with the touch of the spectacular
In It that the volatile Frenchmen delight
in. The youth who grew to be called the
masked wrestler of Paris through his
feats of great strength was the son of a
builder of Paris. His athletic career was
in full swing by the time he was 20 years
of age. In 1S62 he appeared in public at
the Hippodrome in Paris, and that ap
pearance, with its dramatic incidents,
made him first in the affections of the
sport-loving public.
Paris was just then enjoying the mys
tery of a masked strong man, who was
appearing at the Arene Athletique. He
had vanquished many in wrestling and his
identity was surrounded by the deepest
mystery, which was added to by the suit
and mask of blazing scarlet which he al
ways wore.
Stories flew thick and fast concerning
his wealth and lineage, and a chateau In
the north of France, which it was said he
left simply because he was a trained ath
lete, strong beyond compare, and would
fain gratify his desire to show his
prowess. That his face had never ap
peared save behind the scarlet mask had
its charm also for the Parisians, for did
it not give one a mystery to solve?
He was the champion of all he surveyed
so far, for-no onenad yet met him in the
ring and survived his onslaught. But time
went on, and then one day Paris, was
glad to have an "added chapter in the
n ystery of "L'homme masque."
The report went on the boulevards and
Sn .he cafes that the masked man had
'â¢ec'.ived a challenge from an unknown to
â¢rÂ°ri. him for a wrestling bout at the Hip
. 'rome. "On. the third night," the chai
!â¢ nge read; and all Paris cculd hardly
wait. But the time came, and never were
7 he seats of the amphitheater so fulL Ex
pectation buzzed, and even the music had
a question in it. .
Thus began the -career of "Bras de Fer,
the masked wrestler of Paris," for,
though it was never known who called
him by that name in the hippodrome, ; yet
it clung to him. Then there was much
As the voice pealed through the still
ness, the unknown threw back his head
as if to acknowledge the name', but no
sound came from nisi lips, and the black
mask was as if it had never moved. Then
with a graceful bow to the defeated
wrestler in scarlet, the unknown disap
peared, followed by shouts of applause. '
The tension grew greater at the begin
ning of the third bout, for this was to de
cide if the sporting world of Paris .should
have a new idol. After some narrow es
capes on both sides, the unknown threw
open his arms, allowing the man in scar
let to grasp him around his waist and
raise him from the ground, but^ before the
scarlet could throw him he had squirmed
out bf danger. Then came the crucial mo
ment. Both men grasped each other sud
denly and the unknown, twisting the man
in scarlet over on both shoulders, pressed
him downâ downâ down, and then. In the
silence, tense and expectant, two things
happened. As. the unknown pressed his
opponent down in the fall that gave him
self the match', the black mask in some
way became loosened and fell, partially
revealing his features, and simultaneously
.there rang through the hippodrome, the
voice of a man who cried, "It is he, 'Arms
of Iron.'" ,"
From the beginning, of the second bout
it was evident that the unknown intended
to do his utmost. He seized the man in
scarlet, and swinging around him caught
him with both hands and threw him over
his shoulder; but he, landing on his ha.nds
and knees, pounced upon the unknown,
and seizing him around his body, threw
him on one shoulder, several feet "from
him. The unknown landed on his hands
and knees: then followed some fine exhi
bitions of skill and finally the unknown,
by a quick motion, threw the man in scar
let upon one shoulder, both men lying
shoulder to shoulder with the man in
scarlet at 1 a disadvantage and the un
known edging over his breast, pressed the
other shoulder to tlfe ground, winning the
fall. Then again the amphitheater re
echoed with 1 the bravos, but this time they
were for the man in' somber black. .
somber black, and to further carry out
the signature of the challenge, "the un
known" also wore a mask of the same
dead hue.. Another round of applause and
then the contest was begun. The open
ing bout was exciting enough with Its
lively action and ended with the masked
man In scarlet pressing his shoulders upon
the face of the unknown, and forcing him
fairly to the floor.' The sports of Paris
were wild with joy that their idol, their
man of mystery, should not be dethroned,
and the huzzas lasted during the ten min
utes breathing space before the next chap
ter in the contest.

r.Mary Makridoff Is as superstitious as
the rest of her race, but her great : love
for Sinrock Charlie broke down her super
stition upon the occasion of his .death.
She , let him die in ths house. Such' a
privilege has never been accorded, to 'any
other Eskimo .by his people. The Eski
mo's terror of death is supreme, born and
bred in him. A' dying parent, child.' hus
band or wife is cast out of doora like a
poisoned rat and; left : to finish what little
life may be left on the 'snow
"bleakness of the . tundra.' - But it was not
so' with;Sinrock^CharHe. Ausensook.
.- Mary loved him. It , was the love of her
life, a romance that ' had lasted for . years.
Charlie ,was. a good Indian, a busy, intel
ligent and ; faithful one, Tarid : Mary loved
him with all theiheart there. was in her.
When she knew that he was going to die
she did not caro if .his cold, body lying In
the house brought destruction to all. the
members thereof. , It "might, for all she
cared. She was going to care for' : him
until! the last bitter moment.when she had
to' let ; him sllpT from -her . h*oldâ care for
him as she "always had . done. She," gave
him â¢ food and warmth and ; tenderness as

I Sinrock Charlie Augensook is
. dead.
Sinrock Charlie was her husband, and
she loved him. He died, leaving her ;ii
entire charge of his immense e::tat?
which means many miles of white tundra
and the greatest herd of reindeer ever
owned by an Eslilmo.
Mary represents to her people not only
the highest degree of rank and honor,
but of wealth, culture and fashion as
â¢ â¢well. Her power over them Is one with
their time-honored superstition. Her
I mother before her was Queen- of AtesKa.
From her came Tiary's right to rule. Her
father was a Rucsian Y.-ho had. the knowU
edge of a few written 'words, and this
caused her to rank as the daughter of t
scholar. Ker hurlrand. Sinrock Charlie
Auginsook, owned and bequeathed to her
his famous reindeer herd. This has given
her. the distinction cf fceing the wealth
iest of all her people.
Therefore Mary is Queen in every sense
of the word. Her c!apboard house Is pala
tial to the Eskimo eye. Her garments are
regal. Her word is law.
Her home !ks in the midst of th? vast
tundra where her reindeer pasture. There
in the cold land stretch railes upon miies

Not far f rern her houae is the. burial '

There lies, or did He, the body of Charlie
and of .all other dead members of the
tribe. It Is a pen fenced In with drift
wood, a mere pen built out on the cold
tundra, and there the dead bodies are
flung. Malamut dogs prowl there by
nl^ht.
Mary Is the widow of a much-loved, hus
band, but she does not devote her time to
mourning:. She recently gave a gorgeous
party. The guests Included no white wo
men except the guest of honor, but there
were white men of every nationality, such
a mixture as only mining countries know.
The native women were not enough to go
around, but nobody played wall-flower, for
there was too much gayety on hand for
that. An accordeon furnished the music.
The company danced until the little Klon
dike stove with Its glowing box had to be
squelched. They were put through a
quadrille under the white visitors' leader
ship and they fell to with magnificent
spirit, caring not a whit for mistakes and
making fewer, she says, than seemed pos
sible for a first attempt.
Mary watched with tremendous delight
while she, three Eskimo women and four
miners went through the figures. She
was delighted again when the guest sang
"The Irish "Washerwoman," and returned
the compliment by chanting her own na
tive songs and some Russian ones as well
which she had learned from her father.
American games followed: the Indians
became so excited over "button, button,
who's got the button?" that Mary had to
break the string on which they were pass
ing it In order to get them away to sup
per.
â¢ f The supper was a marvelous conglom
eration/ Sherry could never match it.
There were seal meat and porterhouse
deer steak; there was dried codfish dipped
In seal oil for an entree, together with
cold unleavened bread snread with lard.
The dessert' was the piece de resistance;
a splendid pudding made of blueberries,
stirred Into a mixture of flour and mashed
fresh fish iivcr."
Mary is a royal entertainer, and to the
few who are privileged to enjoy her hos

SOME CHRISTMAS GHOSTS
THERE was a dull rattle of chains,
a creaking of old bones and out of
J the heavy atmosphere grew the
J shape of Christmas-Ghost. The
time had come, it knew, for its an
nual expedition into the world of fiction.
Away from the Limbo of Ideas it must go
to perform its part in the great festal

"Humph!" ETunted the new-comer,
"you're on hc::id. aren't you? I might
have known that you'd be here. But 'first
come,' you know, 'Is last taken.' "Â¦
A doleful wheeze, coining from no
where, going nowhere, was* the . first re
ply to this greeting, and then the Christ
mas-Ghost whispered eerily (it had to be
eerie, even with its fellow Ideas, to keep
to practice):
"They can't do without me, without me,
my dear fellow. AÂ« to you, what with
charities and societies and meal tickets
and turkey raffles I really don't see. why
they want you at all. Miser's-Christmas,

to be somewhere.
"My, what a turn you gave me! I
thought I'd got here ahead of myself."
Such a high, nervous voice it was! "But

Fcized by willing-hands, and the two men
glared at each other, one crasy with rage,
the other shrinking with fear.
Dansioss and Allode half carried, half
dragged the Prince forward. As he neared
Bolnroz and the Princess he collapsed and
became trembling, moaning suppliant for
mercy. Anguish's accusation had struck
home.
"Prince Bolaroz. I trust you will not ob
ject if the Princess Yetive substitutes the
true assassin for the man named in your
promise to Graustark." tnid Anguis'i,
dramatically. Bolaroz, as if coming from
a dream, turned and knelt before the
throne.
"Host adorable Yetive." he said, "I suo
for pardon. I bov, r low and lay my open
heart before the truest woman in the

her gown and arose. "I am your friend and
ftlly; Axphain and Graustark v.ill live 11.1
more with hatred' in their hearts. From
you I have learned a lesson in justice and
constancy."
Prince Gabriel was ravir.g like a madN
iv.an as the officers hurried him and Bcr
rcw3g from the. room. A shout went up
from thof?e assembled. Its echo, reach-'
Ins the halls, then the gardens, was final
ly Taken up by the wailing masses be
yeng the gates. The news flew like wild
lire. Rejoicing, such as had never been
knoA-n, shook Edelweiss until the monks
on the mountain looked down In wonder.
After the dazed and happy throng about
the thrcne had heaped its expressions of
love and devotion upon the radiant Prin
cess a single figure knelt in subjection,
just as she was preparing to depart. - It
v.-as the Duke of Mizrox.
"Your majesty. Mizrox is ready to pay
bis forfeit. My life is yours." he said,
calmly. She- did not comprehend until
her uncle reminded her of the oath Miz
rox had taken the morning after the
murder.
- "He swore, on bis life, that you killed
Lorenz," ehe said,, turning to Lorry.
â¢'I was wrong, "but 1 am willing to pay
tbe penalty. . My love for Lorenz was
greater than my discretion. That is'my
only excuse, but it is one- you should
not accep^." said Mizrox. as coolly as if
announcing the time of day. Lorry look
ed lirst at him and then at the Princess,
bewildered and uncertain.
"1 have no ill will against you. my. Lord
Duke. Release him from his bond, . your
liishncss."
T'Gladly. sine? you refuse to hold him to
his oath." she said.
"I am under an eternal obligation to
you. sir, for your, leniency, and 1 shall
ever revere the Princess who pardons so
graciously the gravest error."
Yetive begged Uolaroz to continue to
make the Court his home while in Grau
stark. and the old Prince responded with
the declaration that he would remain long
enough lo sign a>:d approve the new cov

throne. Yetive called in low tones to Lor

""Will you come to me in half an hour?"
"Fcr my reward?" he asked, eagerly.
"Ach!" she cried, softly, reprovingly.
Count -Halfont's face took on a troubled

-She passed from the room beside Hal

despair, glorying in the exposure of her.
heart to the world, her blood tingling and
dandng with the joys of anticipation.
Lorry and Anguish, the wonder and
admiration of all, were given a
kliert but convincing levee in the hallway.
Lcrds and ladies praised and lauded
them, overwhelming them with the hom
sge that comes to the brave. But Gaspon
uttered one wish that struck Lorry's
T,ann. leaping heart like- a piece of ice.
' -"Would .to God that you were a Prince
jof the realm," said the Minister of l^i
i:Â£i!cc a look of regret -and longing in
his eyes. That wish of Gaspon's sent.
Lorry away with the sharp steel of deso
lation, torturing intensely as it drove
deeper and deeper the reawakened pangs
of uncertainty. There still remained the
fatal distance between him and the ob
ject of his heart's desire.- Â¦
.He accompanied Captain Quinnox to his
quarters, where be mado himself present
able before starting for the enchanted
apartment in the far end of the eastle.
Eager, burning passion throbbed "side by
Elde with the cold pulsings of fear, a
tremblinsr race bttT.een two unconquer
able emotions. Passion longed 'for the
voice, the eyes, the caresses; fear cried
ajoud in every troubled throb; "You will
see her and kiss her and then you will
be banished.'*
-The two emotions thus thrown together,
clashing licrcely for supremacy, at last
wove '.themselves into a single, solid, un
comuroaniÂ«inu whole. Out of the two
fe-rcw an aggressive determination not to
be. thwarted. Love and fear Combined to
give him strength; from, his eyes fled the
hop^Jess look, from his brain the doubt
from hits blood the chill. * .
"Qizhznox, give me your ' handâ don't

juiger. Will you be my friend In all that
is to follow?"
*^3he has said that she loves you," said
the captain, returning the hand clasp. "I
am your slave as well as hers."
A few moments later Lorry was In her
presence.. What was*eaid or done during

entrance, and the, moment t that brought

"I will never give you up," he said, as
they came from the door. A wistful
..gleam nickered in her eyes, but she did
not respond in words.
Near the head of the stairway an ani
mated group of. persons lingered. Harry
Anguish war. in the center and the Coun
tess Dagmar was directly in front of him.
looking up with sparkling eyes and part
ed lips. The Count and Countes Ilalfont,
Gaspon. the Baron Dangloss, the Duke of
Mizrox, with other ladies and gentlemen,
were being entertained by the gay-spirit
ed stranger.
"Here he comes," cried' the latter, as he
caught sight of the approaching cguple.
"I am delighted to wee you, Harry. You
were the friend in need, old man," ; paid
Lorry, wringing the other's hand. Yetive
gave him her hand, her blue eyes over
flowing.
"Mr. Anguish had just begun to tell us
how heâ how he " began Dagmar, but
paused helplessly, looking to him for re
lief.
"Go nhcad. Countess; it. isn't very ele
gant, but it's the. way I said it. How I
â¢got next* to Gabriel is what she wants to
pay. Perhaps your Majesty would like to
know all about thÂ» affair that ended so
tragically. It's very quicliiy told," said
Anguish.
"i am deeply interested," said the Prin
Â¦ cess, eagerly.
"Well, ill the first place, it was all a
WuC," paid he, coolly.
"A what!'' demanded Dagmar.. * :'/ -j
"Bluff,"' responded Harry, briefly;
"American patois, dear Countess."
"In what respect?" asked Lorry, begin
ning to understand.
"In Â¦ all respects. I didn't have "the
slightest sign of proof against the festive
Prince."
"And youâ you did ' all that 'on a
bluff?' " gasped the other.
. "Do 1 understand yotr to sdy that j-ou
have no evidence against Gabriel?" asked
11 hI font, dumfounded.
"Not a particle." "
"But you said his confederate had con
fe5i:ed," protested Dangloss.
"I didn't know that he had, a confeder
ate, and I wasn't sure that he %vas guilty
of the crime," boasted Anguish, compla
cently enjoying the stupefaction.
"Then why did you say so?" demanded
Dangloss, excited beyond measure.
"Oh, I just guessed at it:"
"God save us I'.' gasped Baron Dangluss,
Chief ot Police.
"Guessed at it?" cried Mizrox..
"That's it. It was a bold stroke, but
it won. Now, I'll tell you this much.
I was raortaily certain that Gabriel
killed the Prince. There . was no .Â¦ way
on earth to prove it,' however, ami
I'll admit it was intuition or something
of. that sort which convinced me. Ho
had tried to abcuct the Pnnn_ss and he
was madly jea!ous of Lorenz. Although
he knew there was to be a <iuol he was
not certain that Lorenz would ;iube, fo ho
adopted ,a- ; clever plan *to get r:u ol two
rivals by killing une'and casting
on the other.' These Â«ledu<jUoi:s J made
soon after the . murder, but, of course,
could secure no proof. Early this morn
ing, at the hotel, 1 mado up my mind to
denounce him BUddeniy if 1 had the
chance, risking- failure but htvping for such
an exhibition as that which you saw. It
was clear to me that he had an accomplice
to stand guard while he did the stabbing,
but. I did not dream it was ' Berrov/ag.
Lorry"s sensational appearance, when I
believed him to be. far away from here,
disturbed me -greatly, but it made it all
the more necessary, that I should take. the'
risk with Gabriel. As 1 watched him I
became absolutely convinced of hia guilt.
I'll'* only way to accuse him was to do
it boldly 2nd .thoroughly, so I rang in the
accomplice and the witness features. You
all know how the 'bluff' worked."
"And you hed no more proof than this?"
4 asked Dancloss, weakly. .
'That's all," laughed the delighted
eirate-riEt.
Dangloss started at him for a moment,
then threw up his hands and walked
away, shaking his head, whether in stupe
fied admiration or utter disbelief, no one
..knew. The. others. covered Anguish with
-compliments, and hÂ«? was more than ever
the hero of the day.' Such confidence
paralyzed the people. The only one who
was not overcome with astonishment wa3
his countryman. ,
"You did it well.", he paid in an under
tone to Anguish; "devilish wcll.'V :
"You might at least say Tdidut to the
queen's taste," growled Anguish, mean
"Well, then, you did," laughed Lorry. '.
XXVI I-ON THE BALCONY AGAIN.
Throe persons in the royal castle of
Graustark. worn by the dread and anx
iety.'of weeks.' fatigued by the sleepless
nights just passed, slumbered . through
the long afternoon with the motionless,
deathlike sleep of the utterly fagged. Ye
tive, In hrr darkened" bed yfiamber,
dreamed, with smiling lips, of a' tall sol
dier and a throne on which cobwebs mul
tiplied.' Grenfall Lorry saw in his dreams
a "film soldier with 'troubled -face and
averted, timid eyes, standing guard over
him- with a brave, stiff, bacjs and chin
painfully uplifted. Captain / Qu'nnox
dreamed not. for his mind' was tranquil
in the assurance that he had been for
given by the Princess. .
. While Lorry slept in the room set apart
for him Anguish roamed the park with a
happy-faced, slender young lady, into
whose ears he poured the history of/ a
certain affection, 'from the tender begin
ning- to the distracting end.- And she
. smiled and trembled with delight.' closing
not her ears against the sound of his
voice nor her heart to the love that craved
admission. They were .not dreaming.
. After dinner that evening Lorry led the
Princess out into the moonlight night. The
November breezes were soft and balmy
and the shadows deep. .,'
"Let us leave the park to Dagmar and
her hero, to the soldiers and the musi
cians," said Yetive. . "There is, a broad
portico here, â¢â¢with the tenderest of memo
ries. Do_ you remember a night like this
a month "or, more agoâ the moon, the sen
tinel and some [ sorrows?_;. F would again
stand where we stood on* that^nighf and
again look up to the moon and the solemn
sentinel, but not- as we saw them then,
with heartache and evasion.",
"The balcony, then, without the old re
strictions." Lorry agreed. "I want to see
that dark old monastery, again, and to tell
you how, I looked from its lofty winodws
through the chill of wind and the chill of
. life- into the fairest Eden that was ever
denied man."* â¢
â¢ . "In an hour, then, I will meet you
there." . \ Â¦
"I must correct you. In" an hour you
will find mo , there."
She l?ft him. retiring with her
aunt . and the Countess ... Dagmar.
Lorry remained, in 'the ha!l with
Halfont, Prince ! Bolaroz, Mizrox and
Anguish. The conversation ran once more
into the ever-rccurrlnk 'topic of the day,
Gabriel's confession. - The Prince of Daws
.bertjen was- confined -in the Tower ' with
' his confederated Berrowag. . Reports from
Dangloss â¢ late m the; afternoon conveyed

"My child, my child!" he cried, lifeless
ly. "You cannot do this thing!" -
"But the people?" cried Gaspon. bis
eyes gleaming. "You cannot act against
the will 'of the people. Our laws,
natucal and otherwise, proscribe the
very act you ' have in mind. The
American cannot go upon our throne; no
man, unless he be of royal blood, can
share It. with you. If you marry him the
lav/s of our landâ you know them well
will prohibit us from recognizing the mar
riage."
"Knowing that, my lords, I have come
to ask you to revise our laws. My throne
will not be disgraced by the man I would
have share It with me." She spoke calmly
as if she were making the most trivial re
quest instead of asking her Ministers lo
overthrow and undo the laws and customs
of, ages and of dynasties.
"The law of nature cannot be changed,"
, muttered Caspar, as if to himself.
"In the event that the custom cannot
be changed.' I : shall be compelled to re
linquish my. right to occupy the throne
. and 'to depart from among you. I would
break my heart, my lords, to resort to
this monstrous sacrifice, but I love one
man first; my crown and my people after
him."
"You would not leave usâ you would not
throw aside as despised the crown your
ancestors. wore for""centuries?" cried Gas
pon.' "Are you mad, Yetive?"
Tho ; others were with open
' mouths and icy hearts.
"Yes, as much as it wouljj grieve me. I
would do all this," "she answered, firmly,
not daring to look at her uncle. She knew
his eyes were upon her and that condem
nation lurked in; their depths.' Her heart
ached to turn " to ' him with a prayer for
forgiveness,^ but' there could be no falterâ
Ing .now. Â¦
The silence of death stole into the room.
Every man's eyes were glued upon the
white face of the Princess and none could
break the spell. They had expected it,
yet the shock was overwhelming: they
had feared / it, yet the announcement
stupefied them. She looked straight be
fore her, afraid to meet the eyes of her
subjects, knowing that sickening disap
proval dwelt In them. Not a word wa3
uttered for many seconds. Then old Cas
par's tense muscles relaxed and his arms
dropped linjply from their crossed position
on his breast. ,
"My lords." she said, : summoning*, ail
her strength of mind and heart, "I am
gratified to find you so ready to respond
to the call of your whimsical/sovereign.
Yesterday you came' with heart bowed
down and in deepest woe. To-day I as
semble you here that I may ask your ad
vice concerning the events of that strange
day. Bolaroz will do as he "has promised.
We are to have the extension papers this
afternoon, . and Graustark . may - breatho
again the strons. . deep .breath of hope.
You well remember my attitude on yes
terday. You were shocked, horrified,
amazed by my seemingly ignoble effort
to preserve my preserver's life. We will
pass over that, however. It is to discmy
my position that I have called you here.
To begin, I would have sacrificed my
kingdom, as you know., to save him. He
was innocent and I loved him. If. on yes
terday, I would not let my kingdom stand
between me and my love, I cannot do so
to-day.* I have called you here to tell
you, my lords, that I have promised to
become the wife of the man who would
have given his life for you and for meâ
that I love -as a woman, not as a Prin
cess."
Expectancy, concern, the. dread of un
certainty marked the countenances of
Graustark's Ministers and her chief men
as they sat in the council chamber on the
day following, awaiting the appearance of
their Princess, .at whose call they were
unexpectedly assembled. More than two
score eyes glanced nervously toward the
door from time to time.
All realized ] an emergency. Xo sooner
were they out of one dilemma^ than an
other cast its prospects across their path,
creating the fear that rejoicing would be
short. While none knew the nature of
the business that called them together
each had a stubborn suspicion that it re
lated-to the stirring declarations of the
day before. Not one in that assembly but
l'ad heard the vivid, soulful sentence from
the throne. , Not one but wished in secret

When the,. Princess entered with the
Prime Minister they narrowly scanned
tho face dear to them. Determination an/1
cowardice were blended in the deep blue
eyee. pride and dejection In the firm step,
strength and weakness in the loving
smile she bestoived upon " the faithful
counselors. After the greetings, she re
quested them' to draw chains about the
great table. Seating herself in her ac
customed seat, she gazed over the circle
of anxious faces and realized, more than
at any time in her young life, that she

When almost directly beneath the rail
the Countess glanced upward, impelled by
the strange instinct of an easily. startled
love, confident that prying eyes were upon
.her. She saw the dark forms leaning
over the rail and rather jerkily brought
her companion to a standstill and, to a
realization of his position. Anguish turned
his eyes aloft. . ' ..-.
: "Can yo 4 u,"fa!r maid, tell me the names
of those beautiful stars I see in the dark
dome above?" he asked, in a loud, happy
voice. "Oh, can they be eyes?"
"Eyes, most noble sir." replied his com
panion. "There are no stars so bright."
"Mcthought they were diamonds in tho
sky at first. Eyes like those must belong
to some divinity."
"They do, fair student, and to a divinity

said :that men offer themselves as sacri

precipitately up the steps, followed by the
jesting student. "

"Hello. S'.tzky! Is it you? I'm glad to

the threat to abdicateâ was the Weight-^
ies^ yet the most delicate question that
had ever come before the thief men of
Graustark. It meant the beginning of a
new line of Princes, new life, new blood.
a complete transformation of order as it
had come down through the reigns of
many Ganlooks. For the first time in the
history of the country there was a wom
an sovereign; for the first time there had
been no direct rr.alc heir to the throne.
With old 'Prince Ganlook's passing the
masculine side of the illustrious family
ended. ~So matter whom his daughter
took for a husband, the lire was broken.
Why not the bold, progressive, rich Amer
ican? argued some. Others fell In with
the views .of the few who first surren
dered to the will of Yetive. untH at last
but one remained in opposition. Count
Caspar held out until all were against
him. giving way finally in a burst of, ora
tory which ended in tears #nd sobs and
which made the sense of Ahe gathering
unanimous.
The Princess Yetive won the day. so far
as her own position was concerned. But,
there was Lorry to be considered.
â¢ t'Mr. Lorry knows that I called you, to
gether in consultation, but be does not
know that I would have given up my
crown for him. I dared not tell him that.
He only knows that I was to ask your
advice on the question; of marriage, and
that alone. I-ast nlsht he told, me he was
confident you would agree toithe union.
He is an American, and does not appre-^
ciate the difficulties attending such an
espousal. Over there distinction exists
only in wealth and Intelligenceâ position.
I lelieve they call it, but not such as
ours* He is a strange man, and we have
yet to consult him as to the arrange
ment," she said to her lords, pursing her
lips. "1 tear he will object to the plan
we have agreed upon,"' she went on. "He
is sensitive, and it is possible he will not
like the idea of putting our marriage to
the popular vote of the people."
- "I Insist. howe\ er, that the people be
considered in the matter." said Gaspon.
"In three months' time the whole nation
can. say whether it sanctions the revision
of cur laws of heredity. It would not bo
right or just for us to. say who shall be
their future rulers for all time to come
without consulting them."
"I have no hesitancy in saying that
Graustark already idolizes this brave
American," said Halfront, warmly. "He
has wen her affection. If the question in
placed before the people to-morrow in
proper form I will vouch for it that the
whole nation will rise and cry: 'Long live
the Princess: Long live the Prince Con
sort" "

Then followed a Ion?, animated discus
sion, growing brighter and more hopeful
as the speakers* -willing hearts warmed to
the proposition. Lorry was a favorita

But the tears trickling down through
Tuftsey's fingers proved that he wasn't.
"She died this mornin'," he whispered,
brokenly, "an* I come down to find you."
They sat for some time without speak

cries of the wheeling gulls came whim
peringly through the air; the whistle of
a far-off tug sounded like a dismal wail,
and the slap and smash of the waves on
the piles under them was aa if the sea
was weeping also.
Then Tuftsey told how it all happened.
"You. know, Ragsey. she was goin' to

into small pieces and throwing them out

"Lemme through!" he panted. The man

shoved Tuftsey back. "Get out of" here,

then he called out: "Hurry up with that

said the man, shortly, :. without turning,
and then he began calling <againMo the

looked around, saw * Ragsey : at his elbow,
whispered something to him' and then, be
fore any one knew what they were,- doing,
they had' given the fleshy man' a shove
that sent him. with a yell. into. the water,
and leaping- to this- edge of the. wharf
had dived, like two shadows, toward. the
struggling woman-, now really drowning. .
Tuftsey and Ragsey were the heroes of
the hour along the water front. Their
pictures were' in' the papers, along witk
generous praise of their heroism, and the
' other newsboys .-_' were most â¢ envious j of
.them-^and envy is the highest compliment
among'such. But Tuftsey and Ragsey
were niodest and unassuming and bore
their new honors with beseeming: grace.
They sold papers, night and morning, the
same as usual, and the fact of their hav
ing saved that girl's life made but little
difference with their, lives except that
they sometimes went up to the house
where ' she lived. ; The house was far up
on a steep hillâ a little - cottage with -a
tiny green yard and one shade tree. Some
times : :Tuftsey would go up alone, and
the girl," Miss Doris, would sit under the
tree and read to him while he lay stretch
ed out by her side. These were happy
times for -Tuftsey, for. he liked to be read
t|>,, and,, besides, ever since thatincident
at-the.wharf he had felt a" great. nameless
sbmetliing under his ragged coa,t,' which,
drew.' him. toward Miss â¢ Doris,- and made
her; appear prettier and sweeter , every
time Jitr saw her. It was a! something
which made him forget that -he was only
a street- gamin and that- Miss Doris, be

was a T superior being. ,-. So ., Tuftsey often
went / up- on I the - hill.'.,; He felt

Â¦ "That's; jist wot you are!"- said Ras

'Â¦'Â¦ The next moment Ragsey and Tuftsey
were' mixed up in one grand commingling
' of belligerent fists and twisting legs, and
when they, at last separated themselves
they; were considerably the -worse for the
scrimmage. - Tuf tsey's eye was swelled
and Ragsey's nose was bleeding 1 . .
Â¦-"â¢'"bat's all right." said the latter as he
wiped the injured member with his coar
sleeve; "but if you don't want more 'n
a black eye, Tuftsey, you jist see 't you

Tuftsey spat the dirt out of his mouth

Residents of Jhe water front were sur
prised when they came to know of the
unfriendliness between Tuftsey and
Ragsey. But to all questions these per
sons 'answered that' "nothin* was de mat
ter." Nevertheless,, they-, never spoke,
though they met almost every day. They
both visited Miss Doris . once in a while,
but neither found occasion to | carry out
his. dire threads against the other for the
simple reason that each took care not to
get in the way of the other. But after
some days Ragsey 'got a .steady position
in a â¢ chophouse and he ceased visiting
Miss [Doris. . . .. Â». _ :
One Sunday morning Ragsey was sit
ting on the extreme end of a wharf, look
ing ; out over the bay. He had a vaca
tion for that day, -and he had come down
here, to think. He watched ; the " gulls
floating and' dipping and the ferry-boats
and tugs gliding by. He saw the great,
black-hulled ? vessels, that, were moored far
out in" the bay, and he longed to be able
to embark on one of them and sail fat
away. For, as Tuftsey often said,. what
was. the use of anything? Ragsey was no
bodyânobody at allâ and probably never
would be. And Miss'Doria was good and
lovely and; a fine lady, if she; was very
.poor./ Ragsey loved -Miss Dorisâ he, felt

were tho water bottles, the pappoosa bas

house I decoration as well as the dresses

Indians of the Southwest
After an explanatory talk by Professor
James the real Indians opened the en
tertainment with incantations of the
medicine man, the announcement of the
death of a- chief and tho election of a
new- chief. V
Then began that part of the programme
which was rendered by the amateur In
dians. A real Indian song had been
learned by Mr. Sammis and was sung
with the strange wailing tones that are
peculiar to Indian music. ; It took much
practice to accomplish this, but the result
was so successful that the real Indians
beamed with delight at the realism.
That most .touching little attention' of
the mother-in-law to tha future son was
reproducedâ the ceremony In which the old
lady shampoos the youth with cal-a-wash.

NEW YORK'S
LATEST FAD
ENTERTAININGIn the!. success of the penetration lies
the revolution of the steering system to
a -, large extent^ during 3 fogs of \ not only
steamboats on the bay, but on all large
rivers, like the; Thames and the Mersey,
for Instance/- where fogs are so prevalent,
and. will be of great assistance to ocean
liners. "/.Â¦..-'[';Â¦ ':'/ : -...;.Â¦ ,-'.. .-Â¦' -...
V Ott the banks of Newfoundland, where
the fogs are like the Himalayan snows,
everlasting, .the benefit to be derived from
this discovery would be'of untold value. . *
'Â¦Â¦-. Shbuld Mr." Whorf's ideas proved conclu
sively correct his "next suggestion "Â¦' would
be the placing 6t a projector with a green
light \ of : great power .* on each ; ferry-boat
abaft the ' pilot box, - sufficiently \ elevated
toithrow, Its light : fair, and square through
the center of the fog, not for the guidance
Mr. Whorf Intends to use for his first
experiments a marine searchlight project
or, which will be placed at a given height
on the tower, having a - power of r.bout
forty-five amperes. Each ampere will rep
resent about one million candle-power,
so he will have a forty-five million candle
power In all. . â¢'
With this projector he will- use certain
lenses in' order to concentrate the rays as
much as possible and thus give- it the
most possible penetration.'. '
Thenuestion arises. In which direction
shall this powerful light be thrown?" The
answer to that rests very, much with the
captains," and they must decidewhether It
shall be directed to the Oakland mole or
â¢over to Goat Island. . .
It will be Mr. 1 Whorf 's aim to focus well
one of the boats who is more than posi
tive in his mind regarding which light is
the best, for after making his landing at
Mission-street wharf the other night,
where the new lights have recently been
placed, he said very emphatically that
"them green lights was the guckoos of
the water front." And there was more
truth than humor in that Swede's re
nwk.
And now it is to be hoped that this light
which human â¢ ingenuity " and brain* is
about to attempt to bring to the highest
pinnacle of the- electrician's 'art may
prove to be the means of averting all fur
ther disasters on the bay, relieve the cap
tains* minds of that eternal anxiety and
become; the "guckoo" of not only thÂ»
water front, but of the universe at larjx
IF THERE is anything new under the
Bun. that new thing Is about to be
eprung on the universe at large And
this city in particular, and its discov
ery will belong to a San Franciscan.
If all goes well this San Franciscan will
be considered the acknowledged savior
of this bay and coast and will be regarded
as the "Marconi of Green Telegraphy."
It is to be hoped that very soon all
chances of future disasters like the Rio
de Janeiro and the more recent sinking
of the ill-fated San Rafael will be im- ,
possible.
The problem which has exhausted the
minds of all prominent men interested In
the matter of light piercing fog is about
to be overcome.
The day is at hand when land fogs will
bring no fear to the navigators of our
bay, and, fog or no fog, the captains will
be able to handle their wheels with equal
case and precision.
During the winter months there is no
more dangerous piece of water than the
bay of San Francisco. The land fogs
come stealing down the Sacramento River
and from the San Joaquin and envelop the
waters in their folds.
It Is not like the sea fog. which can be
penetrated by the eye for a short dis
tance, but the black fog Is thick and al
most impenetrable, rising to an altitude
of from fifty to 150 feet and there stop
ping, thinning gradually from the base
up and leaving the air clear above it.
The penetration of fog by any light has
generally been considered an impossibil
ity, and attempt after attempt has been
made to overcome the difficulty.
The white light simply threw a strong
I glare against the fogs, and the millions of
molecules overwhelmed it and threw. the
glare back with full force. . .
The red light fared better in that it was
softer and more penetrating, still it was
so unsuccessful that It seemed futile to
make any further effort in that line.
And so the matter rested "in statu quo,"
a hard nut to crack.
But If penetration was an impossibility, {
there must be some way of getting round '
or over this fog difficulty and "over" is
the word that will probably do the trick.
While these disasters have been hap
pening a quiet, self-possessed man has
been doing a lot of figuring and thinking,
with' the result that a number of experi
ments are about to be made, with a very
fair chance of success.
This quiet individual is none other than
F- E. Whorf. the Harbor Commissioners'
electrician.
The tower of the ferry will be his "con
ning tower, and a light of sufficient power
and especially arranged his fighting gun.
The largest .single one is $4,177,638 85,
which was presented by a Cuban' eugar
company incorporated under the laws of
the State of New York. From this sum
the claims run down to $7000 or $8000, al
though such small amounts are the ex
ception, the average claim, not counting
those filed on account of the disaster, to
the battleship Maine, being between $200,
000 and Â£250,000. '- Â¦ 'â¢ =

The "question- of lights that may ; help
to protect the passengers and aid the)cap
tain is therefore one of no small "moment.
With;the : theories of 'the East apd.:the ; '
Old World to figure with Mr. Whorf com
menced to further ideas of his own, with
the result that experiments on a largo
scale will shortly take place.
For years, in all the great railroads of
the world, three lights have, up to quite
recently, been used, the white, the red
and the green, but now" the white 'has
been dropped altogether- and the; red is]
the' danger signal and the" green means
"all's well."
, Not long ago green lights were placed
at the end of |the Mission and Washing- ,
ton street wharves and the [captains of
the. incoming 'boats have declared them
very satisfactory, showing up well in the
fog, and greatly aiding them In reaching
their berths. .. ', - i:'. ; ! *.
Mr." Whorf therefore devoted his atten
tion entirely to the green light. He^knew
it â¢ had the greater penetration. "'â¢; Lantern
experiments/and, trials made in. Europe
and the assertions of .the captains on the
bay of San' Francisco had proved that to
him, and he figured that if a power suffi
ciently strong -could be placed at a high
enough â¢ point "the 'penetration ?would-. be
sufficiently great to pierce the densest fog:;.
Harbor Commissioner Kilburn inter
ested himself very, much' in' this- matter,
and; after several conversations 1 with. Mr.
Whorf he instructed hrm to go ahead and
make good' his ideas.
':-, In .the case of a. land fog the ."modus

height â¢ of the .' light would depend on the
fog, the projector being I so jj placed \ as j to,

HISTORY OF THE SYMPHONY IN SAN FRANCISCO.

â¢A' quarter o(a century ago or there

feel ourselves so tremendously up-to-date
at this beginning of the centurj ; ; Just be
cause we' are. being. entranced' by. a stase
full of orchestral" harmony; our parents,
enjoyed something very Â¦ much like it. -
Kerrold was the early day leader. Some
thing like _ a quarter * of a century ago',
when San Francisco was 'considered 'the
parvenu of cities/ old ", Herrold, father of
the present He'rrold,- led his celli ', and ; his
violins and all the rest of them along,the
drudging road that winds toward artistic
success. He: was a good leader, the ol;l-,

delight in out-of-door exercise. They don't
get as much as they want here, for Rit
ter says it attracts too much attention
to take them out except In a carriage. "
In front, of their Eerlin hume -lies a
miniature garden plat, where they work,
weeding and " planting. The roses grow
little just for them; and the big pans'.es
turn into johnny-jump-ups.
They enjoy their traveling except for
the fact that this world wasn't built to
fit them. Its furnishing3 are too. large.
This makes . them uncomfortable. Down
in . their . clean whitewashed â¢ dresf-ing
room they were taking turns standing on
a chair to look into the glass while' Frau
Ritter helped them. She travels along
with her husband to' look after their
wants. There are a great . many incon

Dressing Is a laborious process, for ths

the Salvation Army garb goes over all. %
Otto, the comedian, strolled out into the
hall clad' In his curly-wig and bonnet.
He shook his tambourine in his manager's
face and dodged like a cat when the Herr
,made for him.
T4E four Lilliputians at the Orpheam
are groirg through the same oid
diSrcuIticp. They are thrust Into
a dressinc-rooin *.vhere the mirror
har.gs cbsunJ'-y high, the table. Is
where the picture melding ought to be.
and the hooks are feet beyond the reach
of any genuine midget.
Besides this, there are troubles at the
hotel. The furniture Is made for a race
o' giants as big as the. one that Jack
killed. No midget can sit comfortably at
the dining table, and as for the dishes,
they are proportioned as If for gour
mands. There !s no sense in it.
The Lilliputians will be glad when they
get back to their Berlin home. There they
are comfortable. There they will find
awaiting them chairs that they can . sit
in and still touch ihe fioor, mirrors that
they can dress before without climbing to
do so, dishes that lit their baby appetites.
In Berlin is their miniature mansion.
Herr Kilter has built it for them. He
is the big German who takes them around
the world, from sea to sea. He it was
who managed their tour all over Europe,
and finally grew so progressive that he'
took them to Buenos Ayres. From there
they made the two months' voyage to
New York, and they, will tell , you in
voluble, vivid German that they haven't
got their sea legs off yet, for they suf
fered from a. seasickness that was not
midget-like in :t<5 proportions.
They are as German as kraut, every
one of them, and they don't bother to^,
learn the ' languages that they pass
through on their travels. Their home is
in Berlin. There Herr Ritter, who has
accumulated a neat sum by touring, has
a prosperous hero.'? with c prosperous gar
den attached, and In this garden is. the
house of the Lii:?pu*.ians.
Four tir.y beds are in it. built .to^ fit
them. There' Is a iivins-roeni with eaj-y
chairs and a. table and couches. Hsre they

studying the -stamp's'. 'that they have col-.

is their fad. and they have an album al
most too big for then to handle. They
are experts as collectors.
They are great r*a:ler.Â«. too. They like
books and they like newspapers.. They
keep\well posted on German politics.
They 'are as up-to-date as four young
men between IS and 26 usually are. ; They
have low lamps to read by In their Berlin
livlngr-roaxn, and bookshelves within

Some Women I Have Known.
Flore, the heroine, is an unusually beau
tiful Italian girl whose family, once noble.
Is ' now of the peasant class. Flore, \ In
spite of disadvantages of training, pos
sesses the dignity and grace as well as
the beauty which In former times char
acterized the women of her house. At
the time the story opens Fiore is engaged
to be married to an Englishman who has.
been staying In her native village. This
man Is supposed by Fiore and her fam
ily to have neither wealth nor position.
In reality he is a nobleman, though" not
wealthy. Lord Castleton, for such is his
name, is about to depart for England for
a short visit there, when he meets an old
college friend, Horace Bowdoin, an Amer
ican. Bo wdoln Is traveling through Italy,
hoping to forget a girl to - whom he has
been engaged, but with whom : he has
quarreled. .When Bowdoin speaks - of re
maining In Italy for a' while, Lord Cas
tleton asks him to ) stay near Flore to
counteract the influence of her friends,
who wish her to marry a rich } farmer. of
the place. Upon the departure, of Castle
ton ' a number of complications arise.
Bowdoin j half falls in love with â¢ Fiore,
who is a good deal of a coquette, after all.
Moreover, lie arouses the Jealousy of : the
farmer, who one day nearly, succeeds in
â¢killing Bowdoin. While â¢ Bowdoin Is . re
covering from his wound, Castleton re
turns, but Fiore will have none ' of him,
.and'so be goes away for. good. Bowdoin
is tenderly nursed by Fiore. / Moved by
gratitude for her kindness and by her un
doubted charms/ Bowdoin asks Fiore to'
marry him. She consents. . ; When - < the
wedding: day arrives, and Fiore and Bow

all along. -This man carries Fiore ; off'
from Bowdoin and takes hereto a life of -

A Princess of the Hills.
"A Princess of the Hills," by Mrs. Bur
ton Harrison, Is a story written in the
well-known style of that writer. . In this
Instance it is Italy which furnishes hero
ine and scene for a novel.
The woman whose personality makes
her ths. strongest; factor In the develop
ment of the story is Portia Matthews, the
wife of a . general in the volunteer army
and the daughter of Senator West, a poli
tician from the Middle West. Mrs. Mat
thews is described ' as being at once j the
most beautiful and ' the Â¦ most; Influential
woman in Washington society. Possess-
â¢ ..among members of official life in
Washington at the time when Lincoln's
first term of office was drawing to a close.
That part of the story, which contains; the
chief interest deals with. the efforts made
by a beautiful woman, of society; to win
for her father the , nomination for ; tho
Presidency. The catastrophe in which the
story ends is the failure to accomplish
this, and the sorrow occasioned to the
woman and her father^ by the means
which the former . has' employed ; to gain
her end. The story is sad, as must be any
history, of ungratified' ambition, but , its
gloom is lightened by the introduction of
a pretty romance, which reaches its ful
fillment as happily as if It had been en
acted in a stateiof society where all'am
bitions are gratified. ' ' .

the story of the book. A simple theme. It
is true, but one filled with the patho3
excited by the terrible earnestness of life
Â¦when it appears shorn of the graces and
conventions of a cultured society. .
To many alms-giving Kieans, at the
most, but a denial of luxuries; to these
people of the "Southeast" it meant labor
added to a life already full of toll, anA
at times a denial of all but the barest
necessities of life. Appreciating this fact
It can be readily seen that the carrying
out of an enterprise entailing a continu
ous outlay of money would become
freighted with great significance to a
group of very poor people. But by these
apostles of the Eastside sacrifices were
made with the cheerfulness characteristic
of those who follow an ideal with single
ness of purpose. So, while their history
at first sight excites pity, perhaps, after
ell, people of their way of thinking get
out of life a happiness whose reality
dudes the understanding of others who
are quite content to have their expendi
ture of time and money bring them a
merely material reward.
The vitality of the religion of these mis
sionaries was shown In the reformation
it effected In the life of Jemmy's father.
Pug Maskery, who. from being one of the
worst characters In a neighborhood re
nowned for Its depravity, became a quiet,
law-abiding citizen. The following prayer
of Pug's is a sample of the oratory of
60 me of these religious enthusiasts:

FRANK T. BULLEN, the well-known
writer of eea^stories, has chosen to
lay almost all the scenes of his last
book on dry land. "The . Apostles
of the Southeast." as this tale is
called, Is a work of decided merit. It is
a history of missionary work carried on
in the slums of London by a little band
of uneducated men and women. These
people are as poor and lowly as those
they try to teach; but they are filled with
the splendid enthusiasm of their cause,
which in other times and places produced
martyrs and the great saints of history.
The leading spirit of this little com
pany is a chimney sweep, poorer even
than many of his class; for he is not only
not clever at. his trade, but all the en
thusiasm and most' of the energy of
Â¦which he is possessed are spent In fur
thering the Interests of his missionary
Â¦work. Jemmy Maskery, this sweep, has
gathered about 4iim a few kindred souls,
who, like himself, are filled with a desire
to carry to others the message which
has made such a vast difference In their
own lives. These people are conriected
Â¦with no church. Their aim is to reach the
large mass of the poor which is beyond
the influence of the majority of churches. Â¦
Their public services are open-air meet
ings, to which gather the moral dregs of
a great city.
Maskery and his friends wish to rent a
hall in which to hold service when It Is
too cold to be out under the open eky.
The efforts which they make to accom
plish their purpose, and the success of
the mission which they establish, form

In Harold MacGrath's mJ^el. "The Pup
pet Crown," there is what the lovers of
animals call a bully good dog. He is in
no way a minor character, but a hinge
upon which the story turns. A San Fran
cisco woman was told about this dog. of
his love for his royal mistress, of his be
ing abused by the rabble because he was
hers, and of his timely rescue; but she
did not quite catch the title of the book.
Prompted by a curiosity to learn the
poor animal's fate, she went into a book
store and Innocently asked: "Have you

It has almost always been taken for
granted that Â§ Mrs. Trollope's deliberate"
purpose in. writing her book was to vilify
and caricature â¢ everything American.. Of
such "a purpose, however, the book itself
gives absolutely not a single Indication.
The whole drift of what she wrote is, of
course, distinctly. unfavorable; but" It \a
evidently set down with, a distinctly hon
est purpose.' Mrs. Trollope -herself, . as
her son has told us, had come to America
with a strong desire to be pleased with
what she was to flnd, being: something of
a radical in her politics at home and im
bued with notions. % verging even upon
gommunlsm. That )Â¦ with â¢ this .friendly
predisposition | she wrote so bitter a I book
is to be attributed partly to the peculiarly
feminine cast of her mind, as set forth In
the paragraphs Just quoted, but more
largely to the circumstances of her stay.
She spent but little time in the older and
more settled portions of the country,
passing through; them only on her jour
ney home. The New England States- she
never visited at all. Her first and most
lasting impressions were formed in the
course of > her three years' residence in
Cincinnati.â From "Mrs. Trollope's' Book

who have been made to wear thimbles at

Madame Patterson Bonaparte, whose
great beauty was her hands and arms,
a beauty preserved to extreme old age.

moving the arm. For the upward mo

as possible In the direction of the ( backs
of the hands, then return to the original
position. 'Bend the hand downward as
far as possible. For the sideways move

these movements the fingers are first held
together and then extended. Slowly bend
the fingers enough to, form a fist,' and

these methods.

BEAUTIFUL hand is one that is

hand may be even more fascinat

iore strongly marks the person of birth

The fashion of ungloved hands for men,
sine years ago. Is said to have arisen
cm the fact that certain aristocrats de
fied that nothing showed their posses

â¢om the new rich like the hands, there
ire a showing of these members was de

le true aristocrat might enjoy the ad

The ideal hand is In color a dean,
talthful white, with a tender, firm sur

I'.rns suggests sea shells, rare petals or
fcatever else Is delicate of tint; the fln
ers are flexible and tapering, with nails
ear, thin, yet firm; the wrist round,
hite and delicately veined. In regard to
te shape, the most beautiful hand is one
eld eo that as the eye scans the outer
lge of the little finger and of the palm it
ppears wedge shaped, the thickest end
eing, of course, at the wrist and the
"edge tapering out to the finger ends. 1
he whole hand should be thin when it
tows this wedge shape, and the effect

â Hands and Feet.
; Associated with the care of the hands
Is the care of the feet.' Neither too large,
nor too- small, but proportioned to. the
stature it supports is the rule for a foot:
"the ideal, one is white, well arched, with
- a' regularly . curved outline and a smooth
'surface, the toes as ; straight ' as possible.
; If the toes are inclined to crook and over-*
I lap ,, each .. other Â¦. a.\ thin ' splint should be
placed under them at night,, to which the
toes are. -tied closely and . firmly. A
I crooked toe - may sometimes â¢ be straight
ened .by putting cotton-wool " between it
and Its neighbor^ Soft corns may often
' be ? entirely cured by means ' of . cotton
wool bound firmly about. them. "Although
the cure is slow; It Is usually effectual.
' . Feet should "Â¦ of ten be well rubbed and
manipulated, after a , warm bath, the toes
each coming in for a, share of rubbing,
which Is. a preventive .of corns. Emery
' paper will remove any rough skin. Nails
-should be cut 'square; If cut in rounded
shape they are more Inclined to grow into
i the i flesh. Ingrowing nails, as a rule, are
caused. by ill-made or short shoes. The
scientific name of this most painful dis
easeâ ingrowing toenailsâ Is onyxls. It is
a turning in of the nail, causing inflam
mation and ulceratlon, and, if not attend
ed to, . proud flesh. Corns and bunions
come from an enlargement of the natural
papillae and the hardening of. the Integu
ment which covers i them. They, too, 'are
caused by ill-fitting shoes. Bunions should
be painted with Iodine; turpentine may be
used occasionally with good effect on both
bunions and corns. For chilblains nothing
is better than a wash made by dissolving
alum in warm water. Apply with a soft
cloth night and morning; the relief Is al
most instantaneous. Do not use the alum
too strong and do not . soak the feet In
alum water. For excessive perspiration
of the feet the best application is a lotion
made by infusions of sage or rosemary;
the feet afterward powdered with starch.
Stockings should often be changed. Bath
ing* feet in salt and water Is a relief to
tired feet. , To rest the feet take off tho
shoes and stockings, lie down, face down
ward, with a pillow under the Insteps of
both feet, so that every Inch- of the
breadth of the feet rests upon the pillow.
The foot is then at ease. Nine out of ten
colds are taken through the ankles: there
fore keep them warm- and well protected.
Comparison with Greek casts shows that
feet have not changed very much; the
second toe used to be longer and more
salient than the others, and this was un
doubtedly the original form of nature:
but the shape has been changed by the
modern shoe,, The Greek feetâ the hand
somest of. themâ were hollowed out well
both Inside and out, the heels were short,
the toes long and straight, slightly spatu
lated at the ends. Court beauties used
often to wear white ; satin gaiters so
closely fitted that they had to be sewed
to the foot instead of laced, and the foot
thus encased bore a marked resemblance
to the marble foot of a Greek statue.

Agathaâ Steam your chin over boiling
water for a quarter of an hour; then rub
gently but firmly with the flngers. If the
black specks seem to have vanished after
sponging. the face with tepid water, close
the pores by using a few drops of tinc

have not disappeared, steam a little long

well kept, so that at the base, tho
white crescent is visible. The art* of car
ing for tho nails requires some experience
and experimenting.' In the first place it
must be remembered. that no two sets of
finger nails : can be treated quite alike,
not alone because of their texture; but of
their formation. To trim" some nails "6 ver*"
much would be to render them j thick arid
ugly, . to leave others too ' long, uncut' or
unpared would increase their tendency to
brlttleness. Brittle nails should iiever.be
cut' until the fingers! have been soaked in
warm water or rubbed with an emollient.
Always, after washing : the Â¦ hands, press
the skin around the nail carefully away
from it, so that thb crescent or half-moon
will show, as It is considered a sign of
beauty. The. half-moons are ' indications
of physical, strength, and' are.never seen
on the fingers of invalids. The nails, of a
thoroughly strong person grow more rap
idly than those of a weakling, hdr do" the
nails of two lingers grow with the' same
degree of rapidity, the nail of the mid
dle finger growing with the greatest rap
idity; and- that of the thumb jeast.. It
has been Computed by a clever person
that the average growth of the finger
nail is one. ihirty^sec'ond of an inch per
week, or a littje more than an inch and a
half npr vrar. *

The Uses of Blowers.
The woman who seeks, in her considera
tion of spring suits, to avoid the lavish
use of artificial flowers, will find that not
only Is she out of style, but she Is neglect-
Ing the most effective of all the season'3
garnitures, for flowers will be to the gown
this spring what applique was a year ago;
what, passementerie was the year before,
that; what the tinsels and galloons were
three springs ago, and what stitching was'
for years to . the best modistes and the
finest gowns.
All the remnants of the years will re
appear, but they will background the
violet decorations and they will supple
ment the trimmings of lily of the valley
and the embroideries that show the gar
den flowers gathered In a bunch.
Upon your ! spring hat you will wear a
market bunch, a. gladiolus,' a rose, .some
geraniums, may be a few cherries, and
who knows but the lilac and the hyacinth
will be added to the list. These have been
kept by themselves, a thing apart, some
thing of spring delicacy, but- they may

If you contemplate a gown for dinnersâ
and what woman is there who does not
glance longingly at the dinner gowns, of
the season â then give up the idea of some
thing heavy and go In for something thin.
Do it. even though your last six dinner
gowns were thin, all made with a-trans
parent yoke and all showing the lining be
neath.
-Transparent Yokes.
Try for novelty in the transparent yoke.
Have It so thin that, your neck looks as
though uncovered and lay handsome ap
plications upon It. fastened bo as to show
off the best points of your .. throat , and
neck. Â¦ Let your stock be absolutely, novel
â there are many ways of securing novelty,
âand ' around the : very upper -edge | run a
little strapping of colored ribbon. Let the
ribbon match the color motif of some part
of the vest,, or the belt, or the sash. Â¦ . .
The dinner sash deserves /a chapter of,
its own. It is so very good and necessary/
There are so many sashes, Â¦ too, ; all In the
best of form. The chiffon sash is charm-.
Ing. You know its possibilities; but when
you have done admiring, it then â¢turn to
the sash of panne and you will begin to
admire all over again.

WITHOUT
chiffon a wo
man set ting
foot Into the>
fashionable worlfi
cf 1302 would be to despair.
There Is no one fabric so much
In evidence, no jtne material so
much needed In the schemes of dress,
no one stuff half as becoming.
Without chiffon the robes of 1902 would
be robbed of their gauzlness and the gen
eral effect of the lightness would be gone.
Chiffon Is seen both winter and sum
mer and has been called the connecting
link between these two extremes of sea
son. On Fourth of July a woman veils
herself In It and makes her stock of It:
In midwinter her gown Is trimmed with It
and her bodice Is fashioned entirely of It.
Her fur coat Is decorated with It, and her
linings partake of Its puffings, while her
underskirts rejoice In Its ehlrrlngs.
Chiffon means more to-day to the
woman of fashion than It ever did before
and the prophets say that It will continue
to increase In meaning and In fashionable
growth. / Â¦
The new uses to which It is put are too
many to be mentioned and too varied to
allow of description. As a veiling It now
comes In dotted form, the dots of differ
ent colors on the opposite, sides. If this
very French form of veiling cannot be
purchased ready made a woman dots It
herself, using a fine needle and much pa-
The "Ways of Chiffon.
A Queen Louise stock Is another article
ef chiffon which she wears. This Is a
long veil coming from the back of the
winter hat. often -from the back of a fur
hat. falling right out from under a much
tailed animal, and this she twists around
her neck many times until it forms a
stock. The two ends, are, now allowed to
hang down the front in stole fashion, and
of cours* these ends are embroidered.
But this Is not all the ways of chiffon.
As a bodice stuff it is so much seen that
to attempt to tell of new ways of treat
ment opens up a field lnexhaustive. , But
there Is a chiffon bodice that may be new.
It is made upon a foundation.- for chiffon
Is too sheer to go alone, and It Is shirred
every Inch, to make Inch-wide puffs.
These are attached to the under part or
lining until a waist Is formedâ an entire
shirt waist, all little soft chiffon puffs.
The . Duchess of Marlborough wore one
cf these. And over It, coming well up un
der the arms, she wore a gray cloth prin
cess skirt, as lustrous as can be imagined,
Â¦with a wealth of arbutus embroidery
around the foot, where it decorated the
flare flounce. A petticoat, nearly all pink
chiffon, was In evidence, with a Cash of
gray In it
An odd chiffon trtmmlnp was worn by
the Duchess one day. It was one of thÂ«
many receptions given In her honor and
the two little ones, the Marquis of Bland
ford and Lord Ivor, aged 4 and 2 years,
were present They were In British trou
sers, dear little fellows, all whlta linen
and made sailor fashion.
Her Grace's Gown.
But her Grace wore a black grown with
a looping of pink chiffon around it It
went around "the skirt in leaps, one big
puffing, tied every elx Inches with a nar
row black satin ribbon. The looping was
pink chiffon and this, tied with the black
ribbon, and draped upon the black skirt,
just at the head of the flare flounce, was
certainly pretty.
But It Is not In the ways of using chiffon
alone that this fabric is remarkable.
Much more note may be taken of the new
kinds of chiffon. These are really nu
merous, varied and wonderful in many re-
Epects.
One reads that at- the coronation ' of
TCing Edward there will be three fab
rics. One is ermine, one is mineverâ if a
fur can be called a fabricâ and the third
is chiffon.
They are trying to get a new name for
It and are succeeding part way. The
new gauzes are really " the '. old chiffons
under a new name and" the heavily deco
rated gold and silver tissues . are j really,
when you come to look at them, our 10
year-old friendâ chiffon!

Go-mis for Parties,
In "party" gewnsâ for.the old-fashioned
name has been revivedâ there are to be
two ' extremes. There will be the very
plain and very, acant eowna, the Prlscilla
type, and the fluffy one. In the same co
tillon onÂ© will see the girl in turquoise)
panne with her skirts hugging her hip*
end nothing but plainness noticeable,
dancing elbow to elbow with the" fluffy
skirted girl. The latter will be a masa
of rufflea. She will "cascade" around tha
feet and her skirts will be short enough
to allow her to trip the light fantastic
without coming: out a bed of rags, -
The trying part will come, not upon thÂ«
edge of her grown, but upon the sides, for
the weight of the embroideries and the
garnitures will pull down the chiffons
and make them tear, 'Not even grena
dines, those tough stuffa, will withstand
the strain put upon them and you will
find them pulling apart Just when they
ought to stay wholeâ and Just where thÂ«
holes show mostâ upon the hips.

The Old Cattleman follow
ing this remark, considered me for a mo
ment In silence. I had myself been hold
ing: the floor of discussion in a way both
rambling and pointless for some time. I
had spoken of the luck of Indians and
the latter's superstitions and other sub
jects various and sundry. My discourse
had been remarkable perhaps for em
phasis rather than accuracy; and this,
too, held a purpose. It was calculated to
rouse my raconteur and draw him to a
story. Did what I say lack energy, he
might go to eleep. in his chair: he had
Cone this more than once when I failed
to interest. Also, if what I told were
wholly true and wanting in any ripple of
romantic error, even though my frienu
did me the compliment of vrakefulness,
he would make no comment. Neither
was he likely to be provoked to any re
cital of counter experiences. At last,
however, he gave forth the observation
which I quote above, and I saw that I
had brought him out. I became at once
wordless," and lighting a cigar leaned
back to hear him through.

finds out that Hardrobe's squawâBloo

Cheyennes off a whole lot. Then he sends
the Red Cloud interpreter an' four local
Injuns with lead hosses to pack this yere

for like everything else there is a manu-

An art journal records that not long ago '
a complete collection abundantly fortified
wlth seals and documents was sent on
to New York to Tie sold to the American
market, ,but the pictures, which were
merely copies of the originals, were, with
few exceptions, so atrociously bad that In
splte of the credentials no â¢ one was de-
ceived. Also the forging of signatures is
an every, day occurrence. -There are men
who make a profession of-doing this, the
placing of names upon unknown worjes of
art. Many of the oldest pictures are un-.
signed, the reason 'for-this being, it Is
said, that most of-the old masters placed
their signatures upon the frame Instead
of upon the canvas as the modern paint
do. With the style of framing nelng
changed, the signature is lost or. if put
on the canvas. It being the last-thing
painted and that generally over the yar
nish, it is also the first to disappear when
the picture Is cleaned. Many of the great
painters - rarely signed their work at all.
for before they let a picture go out of
their possession. It was signed all over

have changed hands in. Christmas gifts,
G. Cadcnasso had a run on pastels,.sell

Pastel is always soft and effective, al
though for some reason or other few art
ists. work in it.- Many, collectors prefer
a pastel to a water, color; In fact, It is
sometimes eoual to oil. One of its dis
advantages is,Â»however, its liability to
damage, for the .least brush will wipe
away an entire landscape, although it is
easily repaired. One of the superior points
is that It never changes color. -Many of
the European artists work In it, although
very few of the originals ever reach this
country. *Not long ago I saw a photo
graph by a pastel by Degas, "Le Lecon de
Danse," which the German Government
recently bought for the Berlin museum.
Also one of Fritz Thaulow, a Norwegian
painter, and it is said that he Is particu
larly partial to pastels, putting as much
work upon them and charging for them,
the same price as for oil.
In Kennedy & Rabjohn's gallery. . on
Post street, there has been recently placed
a large canvas by Ada Romer Shawhan
âa Chinese jar filled with great feathery
chrysanthemums, the , composition of
which is unusual and exceedingly attrac
tive. This artist has overcome the fault
generally observed in the work of all who
paint this flower, that of making them a
glaring yellow; she has painted them in
a mellow tone with soft lines which give
a wonderfully natural appearance with
out the usual . studied effect. The back
ground is harmonious and the picture Is
one of the best floral pieces In the gal
lery.
Frank McComas, who came up for the
club exhibition, has returned to Monte
rey, where he will remain for the balance
of the winter, making some of those stun

pine for which he has become famous.
Edith Whitefleld. whose work was much
admired In the recent exhibition held by
L.. P. La timer In the Maple Room of the
Palace Hotel, has had several commis
sions for Alameda marsh scenes, for
which she Is best known. Also one of
the finest from her brush, a stretch of
marsh showing the bay in the distance,
has .been recently added to the private
gallery of Charles Lombard.

special studies of Chinatown, sold a num

WHY NOT AN AMERICAN SCHOOL OF ART?
0U> Calif ornians will tell you that
tha society gatherings of early
days were far more enjoyable af
fairs than those of the- present
time. That Is probably so, and
eeveral reasons may be assigned for it.
Society 'was smaller and was more like
one large family, not yet being divided
tip Into cliques. Then, too, the entertain
ments were df a more Informal character.
Tbera waa no. lavish display of wealth,
no aping of foreign customs, and people
wexÂ« content to enjoy themselves in much
simpler fashion than nowadays.
Particularly was this the case during
the holiday season, when many a party
of grown people Joined in games such as
blind man's buff and third man, im
promptu charades and tableaux, entering
with zest into the redeeming of the for
feits. Foremost in all these merry gath
erings was the McAllister family. Mrs.
McAllister loved dearly to have a crowd
of young people around her and she was
ably seconded in all. her hospitable plans
by her sons Hall and Cutler and their
pietty wives.
Mrs. William M. . Gwln was a lady
whose eggnog parties were renowned and
on- New Year's eve she always gave a
merry dance, Â¦when that insidious concoc
tion wao the feature of the evening's
pleasure. On the other hand, that old
pioneer. Colonel J. D. Stevenson, was a
famous brewer of punch, and a Christ
mas o/ a New Year's eve party at the
Steverfsons' was sure to be jolly. *
In fact, merriment was the key note at
aU social gatherings in the "good old
days." Who in these days' of form and
elaborate ceremonial can fancy the do
light experienced by matron and maid
alike, beaux old and young, over punch
ing the bag at a New .Year's eve party
given by Mrs. S. F. Butterworth, whose
lovely daughters, Cora and Blanche (now
Mrs. Sidney V. Smith and Mrs. Louis
Haggln) ably seconded their genial moth
er in her hospitalities. This game con
sisted of two huge paper bags, which
were hung side by side In the archway of
the folding doors; one bag contained
gifts, the other flour. Each guest in turn,
being blindfolded and provided with a
long stick, proceeded to "punch the bag"
â L e., try to make a hole in the side and
release the contents. In the event of the
gift bag: being punched, the article fall-
Ing at their feet became the property of
the lucky puncher. When the bag of flour
was struck the resultâ to the "striker"â
was not quite so pleasant. Imagine
Judges Hoffman and Hager, Lloyd .Tevis
and J. B. Haggln. General Halleck and
even Bishop Kip scampering like school
boys to get away from the white shower.
Apropos of the Haggina, the mother of
the present youthful wife of the veteran
millionaireâ Miss Laura Sandersâ was in
her girlhood the beauty of the ffaggln-
Tevis connection. She - resided with her
sister, who was Mr. Haggin's first wife,
and who, In true Southern style, always
gave an. eggnog party on New Year's
eve. Mrs. Tevls. the sister, usually gave
a small dance during Christmas week.
The family of Colonel Ransome was
quite renowned for unceasing hospitality
which, at the holiday season, took, the
form of Christmas tree parties and dances
on New Year's night. Dr. and Mrs. A.
J. Bowie, the parents of the popular beau
Allen St. John of to-day, always gave a
big New Year's eve dinner, when "ter
rapin" and eggnog were features of tha
menu.
A New Year's eve party given by the
family of Isaac Friedlander was noted
for â¢ its Jollity, for fun reigned supreme.
They had large rooms which were twell
adapted for the impromptu charade of the
four seasons, which was the "hit" of the
evening. Hall McAllister tn" his shirt
sleeves, with a wreath of artificial flow
ers on his head, personated Spring; his
brother Cutler, in a long dressing gown
and fur cap, Â« was Winter; Colonel Fred
Sawyer as Autumn held a bundle of hay
under - his arm and', wore a garland of
poppies around his shoulder; Judge Hager
as Summer carried a huge fan and wore
white draperies. They circled -round and
round the room amid the plaudits of the
guests, the carpet-bag carried by Cutler
McAllister being a special point of amuse
ment . : â¢ ' . - ' ; *"" "
W. C. Ralston, the banker, was the
most munificent and untiring host Cali
fornia has . ever ? known, even in early
days, before the era of Belmont. One of
the most unique of his l many frolics was
chartering a steamboat In which he took
a party of his f fiends to -a New Year's
eve ball in Sacramento. 'Another banker
of that period, Julius' May (Rothschilds'
agent), always gave a "Saballion" party
on New Year's ave. They were, however,
chiefly stag affairs. The Julius Bandmanns
were also givers of St. Sylvester feasts a
decade later. The Swiss Consul, Francis
Berton, and his handsome wife, to whose
residence on Mission street a huge music
room : had been built, gave notable New
â¢ Years' gatherings, generally suppers and
dancing, many of their most elaborate
- feasts being in honor of foreign naval
officers. . " . - = â¢ - -

*^f LMOST for the first time the ques
f I tlon of a- distinctly American
râi school of art has been seriously
I taken up and discussed both here
\ JL and abroad. . There is an English
school, a Dutch, a French; why not, then,
an American? Is not the work of many
of our American artists peculiarly dis
tinctly* and Individual with little trac
ing of American influence or of Parisian
technique?
Have they not attacked subjects that
few but Americans have attemptedâ for
Instance, the Indian, the Rockies or Ni
agara and have not the creators of
these pictures been recognized abroad and
their work taken as a representative of
an American type?
For years past foreigners have long
been acquainted with painters from
America who went to Paris and showed
their remarkable faculty of quickly as
similating the teachings and Influence of
Europe, but those students who remained
in Europe merged themselves more or
less completely in the new environment
and stamped out any tendency to assert
their Americanism. Of those who re
turned to America they, too,' carried away
with them the Europeanlsm that had
been absorbed, consequently the paintings
they sent to the expositions were but the
reflex of the French, of. the, German or
of the English painters. There was noth
ing to distinguish the American art; even
the painters themselves had lost the ac
cent of their mother tongue and spoke In
the echo of the Europeans.
But In the last few years condition*
are changed. The foreign artists have
been forced to consider the possibility of
a new school and the foreign critics are
vigorously discussing It, for the exposi
tion of 1900 contained an American sec
tion which could not be passed over
(slightingly. A dignified consideration
without a patronizing tone pervaded all
the Parisian criticisms and foreign re
views. The pictures submitted were no
longer the reflex of Europe; they were
at last representatives of the difference
which the American environment steadily
impresses' upon those who live and paint
at home. A New York critic who at-
tended the exposrtfon writes: "On view
ing the American section in the Paris
Exposition one is conscious of a sobriety
and earnestness, a' simplicityâ in fact, a
more obvious connection in the Ameri
can work than In that of the French sec
tion as a whole. The Americans do not
as of other years seem" to be painting in
evidence to some vogue; still 'less with a
purpose of creating one, they did not
thresh about for motives which should
electrify or thrill and prove brief sensa
tions, nor do they seem to be bent upon
exhibiting the particular -advantage of
this or that method of technique. Their
work for the most part is unassuming
and straightforward, penetrated with
realism and tempered with poetlo feeling,
not less suggestive of the true painter
like way of conceiving the subject be
cause It was exeouted with so little de-
Bire to exploit the, mere facility of brush
work, yet showing a sound and advanced
acquisition in technique. In fact, . the
American work shows superior to that of
Norway, with the fresh vigorous spirit
of which it otherwise had so much' In
common.'* ' Â¦_ Â¦ â¢ ' -
A foreign review says "that the quali
ties of earnest force, of directly straight
forward vision and strong treatment evi
denced In the American work of the
Paris Exposition almost forces one to the
conclusion that there is a possibility in

True If Is tha^.our country is young/' It
cannot expect. to compete all at once with
tliose of Europe that have passed through

art in America has advanced and will con

we have no leisure class, no kings, as had
the older countries, to stimulate art and
its followers, few corporations or churches
that have offered scope for an American
artist's skill, we have still collectors, too
few as yet, but those few are a keen eclec

THE SUNDAY CALL.
time and a ball as the medium for her
social plunge, and securing the late Mrs.
Hall McAllister as her society sponsor
issued her invitations with Mrs. McAllis
ter's card inclosed. The effect was magi
cal.. Mrs. Barroilhet, who was hitherto
almost unknown socially, became in a
moment famous, and the ball was a great
success. '
A house noted for the Jollity .of Its gath
erings at holiday time was that of Mrs.
William Hooper.,, who had able assistants
in her son, Willie Little, and her daugh-#
ter Augusta. The latter, as Mrs. Felhany
Ames of to-day, keeps up the family tra-(
ditlon for hospitality. The Hoopers were\
much giveV to holiday week gatherings, >
when the amusement consisted of gamosl
of various kinds, dancing and supper. g
:The late Ed Sheldon, who gave suchj
dainty bachelor dinners and suppers tod
his lady friends, and Ed Greenway.j
Peter Martin and Harry Holbrook, who*
shine as hosts, are by no means pioneers t
ill that line. Probably the first who can
lay claim to being bachelor hosts were
Messrs. Alfred Godeffroy and William
Sillem, the pioneer partner lumber mer
chants, who between 1S55 and 1S60 kept
Bachelors* . Hall together out on Powell
street, - near Green, and. gave many a
merry party, to the ladies of that day.
Then there was F. L. A. Ploche, the
French capitalist, -who delighted to en
tertain musical stars at his bachelor
abode on Stockton street, and to â¢ whom
he always presented some article of Jew
elry as a memento of the occasion. As
for Instance his New Year's eve supper to
Mme. Parepa Rosa, when she found a
magnificent bracelet hidden In the fold of
her, napkin at the supper table.
In noting these festivities 'of the holl
iJay season, one of the chief pleasures â
to the ladies at leastâ must not be omit
ted, which was the New Year's day calls
made by the. men upon their lady friends,
and to It many a belle looked forward
the whole year round.' Calling began
about 11 a. m. and lasted, with slight in
terruption, until ;far into the evening. It
was like the "tea" of the present day. In
that the lady of the house was surround
sd by a bevy of lovely "assistants," but
unlike in that men only were the visitors.
The call lasted from two to ten minutes,
the stay being largely regulated by thÂ»
length of the man's calling list. Refresh
ments more or Â¦ less elaborate, were>
spread on. a- table in the. room with the ;
receiving. party. i> I
In some cases the rooms were art!- J
Rcially lighted and the ladies wore decol-J
lete costumes, but in the majority of!
bouses the' bright sunshine was not ex- J
eluded, And afternoon reception dress was *
the rule. Occasionally a hostess who had \
\ number of ladies receiving with her I
would invite some of the men to return J
In the evening for a dance, and thus the |

SAiN FEANCISCQ, SUNDAY, v JANUARY V5, 19027-THmTY-SlX -PAGES: IIt seems that Charles Hopkins had at
different times fallen Into a trance or
cataleptic etate, during which he would
remain as one dead, but he always re
vived. -. On Monday, : December 9, while
chopping wood, he bad h fainting fit and
was carried to his cabin, where he lay
for four days without giving a sign of
The facts are absolutely authentic and
are attested by H. H. McNaughton of
Haines over . his own signature, of date
December 19, who asks that the case be
given full publicity. The excitement at
Haines over the affair was Intense- when
the Dolphin sailed south.
SKATTLE, Jan. 4.â A story of the death
of a Seattle man by being buried alive
at Haines Mission, twenty miles below
Skagway. on. Lynn Canal, reached this
citv to-day from the north en the Dol
phin. The victim of the tragedy was
Charles Hopkins, aged â¬2 years, a Grand
Army man, a member of the Masonic fra
ternity, and who Is supposed to have left
a wife and two sons in Seattle.
So great became the indignation when it
was learned ! that such summary action
had been taken with the body that the
existing doubt resulted in the grave be
ing opened on December 19, six days after
burial. The coffin was taken out and the
top unscrewed. The body showed a life
like color; and the. flesh was natural to
the touch. All were mystified. - When the
body was exposed to the cold air the skin
turned purple. . The peoplfc congregated
around were awed and some of the super
stitious secured the body and privately
had it buried again without. waiting for
further developments. - â¢ . - * Â¦
Now the physicians at Skagway express
the belief that the man was just being:
brought out of his trance again and was
burled alive. Hopkins, left considerable
mining property and had frequently as
serted that he would be buried alive.
There was no physician .at Halnes to
prove the certainty of death, and the peo
ple who burled him, it is claimed, under
the existing " circumstances were too
hasty.;. ' . â¢ . â¢" ' , .

buried, though it was the opinion of many
that life was not extinct.

The ' occupants "of the other boat â the
last one-.to come -ashore 'â¢ of the eight
launchedâ did not arrive in time to take
the Pomona. There are seven survivors
in this party, which landed at Stone La
goon, a few miles -above Trinidad. Boat
swain Holmes was in charge of -the boat.
With , him - were E. Johnson, sailor: ~- P.-
Naucett, messboy; Arthur Johnson, sail

man. â¢. , Â¦ : '
These men : reached ; Eureka to-night.
The boat was beached near Stone Lagoon
yesterday forenoon at 11:15 o'clock. When
it struck the beach the 'sailors were
thrown into the surf, but all succeeded in
.reaching land.,' - Â¦ 'Â¦ i
Against the members of this boat there
is bitter feeling among- some of the offi
cers and passengers saved from the Walla
Walla, i Many claim to have heard Cap
tain Hall give orders for this crew' to go
to the stern and rescue passengers. In
stead, it is' said, they pulled out to sea.
Their story is quite different. Boat
swain. Holmes in an interview to-night
said:- Â¦ Â¦
"I was the last one of the seven to get
into the boat, and I left in the last boat
that left the ship. v)ur boat was got off
on the opposite side from that whejve the
passengers -were. It 1 was' the smallest
boat on the ship. It soon filled with
water, and we had to keep bailing. It had
no plug in it and Nelson used his hand
kerchief for a plug. â¢ When we were go
ing around the ship I thought she was
sinking and we got the boat away to keep
her from being sucked down. We heard
some " cries among the ' wreckage, and
pulled in that direction, .but the cries
ceased. I kept the boat in that vicinity
until daylight, but found no one. We had
in the boat one good oar and one oar
with half the blade gone. With these we
rowed to" where we landed. We were
thirty-two hours on the ocean. The
roughest weather came on the first fore
noon." â¢ Â¦ â¢ ' v- ' . v v ;;;
one hours. All suffered greatly from ex
'posure, but no one was lost until the
beach was reached and an effort made to
land. , - ' .
Â¦ "I was against i landing," : said Kalz
schan, "but I could not prevail on them
to wait. Some j of them 'were like crazy
men, threatening to kill themselves. The
landing was made, but my wife, was car
ried'away by the waves. I .went after
her and. reached -her, but lost her again
through the force of the undertow. Â¦;-'. I
caught hold of her a second time, but the
undertow wrenched her from my grasp.
I then became unconscious and was res
cued by some of the others. Oh, it is
awful to think 'of her suffering- bravely
throughout it all and then to be lost at
the last! I want to get away from those
men .1 have been with. I never want to
see any of them again." - '
With this Kalzschan left, the' offlce of
,the steamship company, where he i had
rested for a -minute, = and asked to-be al
lowed tto â¢ so somewhere where he could
be alone: Many of - the bystanders who
have * heard and witnessed many sad
things during the last two days turned
away to hide their sorrow, for this man's
grief -marked face and sad story were the
most lamentable they had. seen or heard.
â¢ Tne remaining: two men who lajided at
the Lagoon, W.*H. Weaver. and Charles
Glesson, were left at Trinidad, 'being too
badly used up to-be moved at present.
Although the life saving crew was out
all last night and to-day no sign of the
missing rafts .have been discovered. Last
evening- itt . was believed that a raft had
been sighted. The rife saving crew went
after. the object seen in the. distance. It
proved, to their disappointment, to be an
abandoned Â¦; sail. ' The people of Ferndale
patrolled . the ; Centerville beach, near,

â¢ The Nome City had a little ' adventure
of her own on the way down. She left
Seattle ten days ago and was. proceeding
toward Portland 'when her high pressure
cylinder blew out just as Cape Flattery
was rounded. A slow run was made to
the Columbia River and a delay of two
days and a half was encountered there on
account of the fog. - -
As soon as the Nome City tied up at
the wharf the Rev. Mr. Ericksen was sent
to. St. Mary's Hospital In' the ambulance
of. the Harbor Emergency Hospital. He
was very weak and all intercourse with
him was refused by the hospital author

company's to â¢' report and the others
hastened to their . homes. â¢
This statement," which embraces 'the
story as related by the different surviv
ors, explains why so many of the officers
were found on the one raft. All others
had left the ship and they were waiting
the last chance to save their own lives.

New York has been told that It has in.
a Stanton-street block the "wickedest
block in the world." Rev. Robert L. Pad
dock made the astonishing statement in
an address at the Columbia College. Said
he: "The block opposite the Episcopalian
Pro-cathedral In Stanton street 13 tha
wickedest place in all the world. It has
seven houses. ' It contains a thousand
families. Families of from five to twelve
persons live in two rooms." Speaking of
Western and Southern plague spots he
said: "They have plague spots there, it
is true; but there is nothing in San Fran
cisco to compare in utter degradation and
shamelessness with that block across the
street." Of course, an Investigation was
made and - scores of angry tenants were
interviewed, but not one of them, would
admit any truth in Rev. Mr. Paddock's
impeachment. The only admission gained
was from a woman, who said: "Maybe it
is. It all depends upon how you look at
it." The ruling sentiment or the block
to-day appears to be. "Mind your own
business."

Erickson and a, woman whose name Is
not known were originally - on the â¢ life
raft. With this load on board the raft
eat -very low in the water, and all were
repeatedly partially' submerged. :, Finally
! the woman was transferred to a lifeboat
which happened near, and an effort was
made to direct the course of the raft to
the Mendocino shore, some thirteen miles
away. As the hours passed young Erick
son sank lower and lower, finally dying
in his father's arms. His body was ten
derly consigned to a watery grave.
As the day wore on- a keen watch was
kept for passing vessels. Finally a ves
sel, since known Â«o be the Dispatch, was
sighted and in the distance was^seen to
stop and lower boats. Efforts were made
to signal her. A wet coat Was fastened
on two oars and hoisted to attract atten
tion. After an hour of expectation â¢ the
Dispatch was seen to make for : the har
bor of Eureka. Then the sufferers settled
down to watfch for another -vessel. <
Toward nightfall the Dispatch was seen
coming out of the harbor of Eureka and
most strenuous efforts were made to at
tract her attention. But these "were as
unsuccessful as before and the Dispatch
proceeded on her way W without ' having

ADVEBTISEHCENTS.Second Officer Frederick Lupp was In
good spirits when he left the Nome City
last night, despite the terribUj experience
he underwent on the raft. He talked of
his plight and that of his companions and
"I cannot describe how we suffered from
cold, hunger and thirst. It is bad enough
to be exposed In an open boat, but on a
raft one has no protection whatever. We
were drenched again and again by the
waves that washed over us. With all our
hardships, however, I do not think that
any of us gave up hope. I know I would
not have ceased to hope for relief until
death itself came. We were picked up by
the Nome City Friday afternoon at 6:30
o'clock."
"This left but the six men who were
rescued by the Nome City and young
Erickson aboard the raft on which I was
riding. During the remainder, , of the
morning we endeavored to ro,w toward the
shore, but our raft proved rather an un
wieldy affair. The wind and waves were
against us and we were unable to make
any headway.
"When t,he morning cleared we were
still near the scene of the wreck.' We
could see the Dispatch about a mile away.
We tied two of the oars together and tried
to signal the boat, but we failed. We also
saw several other rafts with people
aboard floating about, but we were not
within hailing distance of them. Several
times we attempted to propel our raft to
ward the shore, but our efforts failed.
Rafts under ordinary conditions are not
made to be rowed, and we were badly ex
hausted from being exposed to the frosty
morning air after our plunge Into the icy
waters. We finally gave up trying to row
and allowed ourselves to drift, in the hope
of being picked up by some passing boat.
We saw a number of vessels passing dur
ing the thirty-six hours that we were
adrift, but none, unfortunately; happened
to see us.
"We certainly had an experience that
none of us will ever forget. The raft on
which we were drifting when the Nome
City picked us up was only an ordinary
ship's rait, sixteen leet suuare. It ar
loraed us absolutely no protection from
the cold night wind nor lrom tne waves
which frequently swept over us. . The
greater part of the time some portion or
tne raft was under water. Our clothes
were drenched, and tnis morning they
were almost frozen stitt. X oung Erlclc-:
son died from exposure and we . were
forced to toss his body overooard even In
the presence of his father, who was, him
self almost overcome. It had to be done,
as we could not possibly retain the re
mains on the raft.
"When the bark collided with the Walla
Walla I was in my bunk. I immediately
rushed on deck and as soon as I found
out that a hole had been stove in our ves
sel and that she was doomed to go to tha
bottom I- Immediately commencea to work
for the safety of the passengers. Almost
without exception the passengers were
asleep in their berths and in some in
stances we were compelled to use force
and pull them out.
"I worked at rescuing the , passengers
until the Walla Walla commenced the
final plunge. As the boat was going
down a young woman whose name I do
not know came to me and asked for help.
I seized her in my arms and jumped over
board. I swam about for a considerable
time looking for a raft or boat on which
to put her. At last I found a raft, but it
was crowded and I could only find room
for the young woman. I put her aboard
and then swam off to look for another
raft or boat. I do not know whether she
was rescued or not.
"I found another raft, but I should
judge that there were already over thirty
people clinging to it. 1 managed to catch
hold, and very soon afterward another
raft with but a few people aboard cauio
floating by. Part of the people from the

Brown had the same tale. of suffering
from exposure, hunger and thirst to tell
as was related by his comrades on the
raft. Regarding his experience and that

be said: /
;Â¦' Â¦'â¢""â¢=Â¦ Brown is", a young and a
hardy seaman and enured to hardships,
he was scarcely able to walk when the
boat reached the dock last night. So
much had he suffered from the cold and
exposure while he was afloat on the open
raft that he was bowed like an old man.
Brown hurried at once to his home at
575 Powell street to carry in person the
news of his rescue to , his mother and
father. .

Of the defendants, Neely, Rathbone and
Reeves were seated on one side of the
room and Moya and Mascara, the Cuban
stamp clerks, on the other. Neely showed
no signs of his confinement. He has
grown stouter and was in good spirits.
Upon the opening of the court Rathbone
was informed by the Judges that his
counsel, Senors Lanuza and Desvarnina,
had withdrawn. The .court asked the
other counsel for the defense if they
would assume charge of Rithbone's case
and being answered in the negative ap
pointed Lawyer Pascua. a court employe
and gave Rathbone one hair in which to
consult with his new coutsel.
The court then asked Neuly to plead and
the latter responded that he had never
heard the accusations against him; but
after consulting with/ his counsel he en
tered a plea of not guilty. . Rathbone
Moya and Mascara .also pleaded not
guilty and Reeves was granted permis
sion to wait until the next session of the
court before making his plea.
Senor Zaya, Neely's counsel, asked that
the accusation against his client be read.
He said he had not given instructions to
Neely, as the court. had not allowed him
to consult documents and examine papers
in order to prepare his defense. The
complaint was- read in Spanish, consum
ing two and a half . hours. During the
reading Rathbone rose and said he de
sired to protest against the continuance
of the trial until he should have time to
get counsel of his own selection; and also
that if his plea was to be taken as a de
position he wished to withdraw it. " The
court said - that the plea would not be
taken in the circumstances and that
Rathbone's protest would be considered.
The court In its refusal to postpone the
trials said that there was no reason for
delaying the proceedings because the in
terrogatories and other evidence for the
defense had not arrived, since they might
arrive at any time during the trial. , The
defense takes the ground that the Gov
ernment is submitting a great mass of
documentary evidence, and~ that the
twenty days given them. in which to file
an answer Is not sufficient. :

FIRST OFFICER PETER NIL
SEN of the Walla Walla pro
ceeded to the offices of the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company
after he landed from the Nome
City last evening, ' and there
made a report of the loss of the
vessel to which he was attached. \-"^
After leaving the offices Nilsen went to
his home, 236 Collingwood street, where
word of his arrival had preceded him. Nil
sen received a warm; welcome, from his
wife and two little girls, and though tlfe
hour was late, many friends were present
to' congratulate > him on his escape: from
a watery grave.
In speaking of his experiences, Nilsen
said: . Â¦
"I' was asleep in my berth when we
were | run into, j The first I knew of any
thing wrqi;g was the terrific crash that
woke me up. I slipped on some â¢ clothes
and' rushed on deck. I did not. see any
thing of the ship that had run us down.
Captain Hall was on deck when I got
there and he was giving orders in a cool
manner. The crew behaved with perfect
discipline and the panic. among the pas
sengers soon subsided. (Â¦ Â¦ â¢ ...
"The boats and â¢ rafts were lowered in
good time and we had no trouble in get
ting the .'. passengers into them. The
weather was nasty and very cold. I
stayed with the Walla Walla - until she
went down. I was drawn .under water for
quite a distance and then I came to the
surface. .1 climbed on to a raft and then
transferred to another one. Three rafts
were in company -for â¢ a time and then
parted. There were six people on my raft,
exclusive of myself. : I had five of the
crew and two passengers â Rev. Mr. Erick
son and his 16-year-old son. -- :
"When the mist cleared away in the
morning we could see the Dispatch, which
I then judged to be about a mile away
from us. She was headed toward the
harbor. We fastened . two oars | together
with a ivet coat stretched between them
and attempted to signal the Dispatch,
but our efforts were in vain. She evi
dently did not see us, as she proceeded
directly into the, harbor. We also at-
gave them all due credit for their hero
ism. He said: '
"From the minute the big French bark
crashed into our Â«steamer until we Â¦ were
picked up nearly starved and frozen to
death our party underwent a harrowing
experience. Those of the crew that were
with me did more to help out everybody
on the ship than anybody else. -We
launched eight boats and â¢ five life - rafts
and were trying to launch the last big
lifeboat on the upper deck when the
steamer settled so far that we all had to
scramble-for our lives. . : -; -
"We got to the side of the steamer and
jumped onto alife raft and shoved away,
but . were scarcely more than out of suc
tion range .when the Walla Walla went
down. We stayed- around the scene of
the i wreck and picked up several people,
including Mr. Nilsen, the chief officer/and
the Rev. Henry Erickson and his son,
who afterward died from exposure and
the effects of his submersion. We picked
up a woman, but our raft could not hold
her, so we placed her on another, raft. â¢'
"The suffering we | endured after we left
the scene of the wreck is simply ; beyond
human comprehension. We did all we
could for young Erickson, who died,
and as the father was fast succumbing
to the cold .and- exposure and the sight
of his- dead son .lying on the same raft
we ; dropped the body overboard. It was
a merciful act to do, both for our own
sakes and for the sake of the distracted
father. - , . Â«
"The fourth officer, the cook, the pan
tryman - and myself ' all : turned * to and
worked with a will with the oars, but we
could not make any headway toward the
land. The sea was running high enough
to harass the progress of the life raft,
and we made a game struggle against the
elements. We saw the Dispatch going
into Eureka and saw her come out later,
but we could not signal her. When the
first day passed we were all well nigh
worn out. r The night set in cold . and
blustery | and Â¦ ; nearly every wave that

PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS
FOR THE SUNSET VAI.LEY
Captain Daniels lives in this city at
Fifth avenue and Le&ora street, where
his family at present reside. He is well
known on the Sound and in the Nor in -
west and had been engaged in operating
the fishing schooner for . years. The
schooner is one of the old timers in the
local fleet. During the summer she had
been in the habit of operating on the hali
but banks below Cape Flattery, . off the
straits, but in the winter went to the
north with the rest of the vessels simi
larly engaged. ' " â¢ ; .
The first advices of the destruction of
the '. Sunde â¢ reached Wrangel Narrows,
where the- steamers take aboard the fish,
and was there sent down via the Dolphin.
Purser McClinton endeavored to learn if
any of the crew had been lost, but no one
seemed to know whether they had been
saved or not. The craft was owned by
her captain, John Daniels, but E. B. Dud
den of the firsh company had a slight in
terest in her.
. | The steamship Dolphin, which reached
port from the north this morning, brought
news j of the wreck. Â¦ Tins ' particulars are
very meager and ;only go to . show that
the vessel is on the rock beach, hopeless
ly damaged by the wind and waves. She
went' ashore during a blow succeeding
the storm of Christmas night, -which
brought grief to so many vessels in
northwestern waters.
SEATTLE, 'Wash., Jan. 4. â ThÂ«
schooner Norman Sunde of this city, one
of the best known craft of ' the fishing
fleet, is a total wreck on Five- Fingers
Island in Alaska, and Captain! John Dan

probable, however, that any lives were
lost, as the men aboard undoubtedly had
a good opportunity to reach shore safely.

"All day the next day we rowed hard

City coming along we put extra steam
to our pulls because we knew it was our
last chance. We made signals to the
Nome as best we -could and ' at last at

The news of Nilsen's safe arrival home
spread through the Mission last night and
caused much rejoicing as Nilsen numbers
his .friends by the hundreds.
"Yes," the father replied, "I prayed to
God also out there . on . the . lonely water,
and he answered our prayers." -
Nilsen -was hardly . able "to speak last
night owing to the â¢ severe cold he had
contracted and the exposure he had been
subjected to on the raft. Tears were in
the eyes of the rescued officer as his lit
tle girl, Â¦; Agnes, climbed to his, knee and
putting her arms around I his â¢ neck said.
"I knew that God would give you Â¦ back
to us, papa, for I prayed to him all night
to send you to us. Did you pray to God
also?" . . - .
Not until last evening did Mrs. Nilsen
and her ' children Â¦â¢ receive news that
brought consolation ' to . their stricken
household. Immediately Nilsen landed he
telegraphed to his wife of his arrival and
a few minutes later Mrs. Nilsen received
a telegram from Eureka from her. brother.

best to lighten the grief of his father,
who was very weak and exhausted. We
held a consultation and decided that it
would be best to cast- the body off the

"Our experience on the raft was an
awful one. We were afloat for thirty

kept a lookout for. the other boats or

After the body of the boy had gone
overboard the father became more and
more despondent Despite the advice of
his -companions, time and time again he
filled -his hands with water and drank
it. down. This added to his misery,, and
his companions feared that he would be
the next to succumb. J'he sea was run
ning high and dashing over the raft, but
all clung on tenaciously through the long
hours of. the day and the longer hours of
the night. They hoped against hope^hn
til the Nome City picked them up. The
Rev. Mr." Erickson was the first to be
lifted aboard. He was at once placed in
bed and as carefully tended as circum

will recover from the terrible effects of
the exposure, unless he succumbs under
his great grief.

Facts about our I
sectional bookcases I
Probably no line of furniture has sprung into favor so u
| quickly as sectional bookcases, and yet it is easily explained. H
as the expansion system is almost a necessity to N house the B
accumulating books. As this condition arises an additional a
section is purchased at slight cost, and the bookcase grows | |
with your library and meets your requirements. As there Jj
are several makes on the market and all are about the same B
i price, therefore merit is the main consideration. B
All of the objectionable features, such as iron bands on Â¦
the sides and shelves projecting between doors, have been fl
overcome in the system we offer. In this system, while of ~
necessity built in sections, they are so nicely joined together / . Q
that the outward appearance is that of a solid, handsome piece 9
of furniture and an ornament to any room. S
The doors operate on roller bearings and cannot possibly B
bind. This ingenious device allows the door to be operated M
with a single knob, leaving one hand free for removing or K
replacing books. This is the only system in which a glass can B
be replaced by. simply unhooking the door. In all other makes I
the books must be removed and the case taken apart. As to S
the quality of lumber, cabinet work and finish, these we guar- I
antee to be first-class. Your choice of oak in golden finish or fl
mahoganized birch. M

BOSTON. Jan. 4.â The six-day bicycie
ra.ee at Park Square Garden ended to
night in a fist fight which became gen
eral in a few minutes. McFarland and
Maya were the victors In the race. The
six leading teams were on even terms in
the distance traveled during the week,
the winning places being taken in the last
fcprint. The battle for firet money started
on the last mile. Until the fifth lap the
order was: McFarland, Freeman, Gou
grlotz, Leander, McLean and King. Then
Lc.ander, in a burst of speed, went ahead
of the field. He was going very fast and
McLean was after him. While rounding
the bank into the etretch Gouglotz and
McLean came together and went down,
the others running away from them.
Gouglotz was the first on his machine and
away he went. Leander held the leading
position until the beginning of the laÂ«t
lap. McFarland jumped and won first,
with Leander second. Freeman third.
Kins fourth, Â¦ Gouglotz fifth, McLean
sixth. Chevalier and Fisher captured sev
enth prize and Krebs and Keegan eighth.
Muller and Jack, who remained in the
icce until the finish, got ninth position,
but were outside the prize money. The
final scores were: â¢ ,
McFarland and Maya, Leander and
Kntz, Freeman, and Munro, King and
Samuclson, Gougoltz and Simar, McLean
and Butler, 1193 miles 6 laps; Fischer and
Chevalier, 11S3 miles 2 laps; Krebs and
Keegan, 11S3 miles; Muller and Jaak, 1192
miles 7 laps.
Trouble began almost as soon as the
men were over the tape. McFarland, who
had won first place oniy by inches,
jumped off his wheel and hashed at Lean
der. Other riders and trainers made, a
grab for the men and got Leander out of
the way. Freeman next went after -Lean
tier and struck him full in the face*
Thereupon riders, trainers and spectators
took a hand, and for a few minutes the
affair looked like a riot. Policemen
lumped into the mass of men and
straightened out matters, but the eaccite

obliged to take to hte bed again and al
though the best attention was given him
he succumbed to ' his illness. It became
obvious that Mr. Russell was dying sev
eral days ago, when he experienced sink-
Ing sr>ells, each of which left him nearer
the end. ~"
Tf OHN A. RUSSELL. Clerk of the
1 . Board | of Supervisors ! for thÂ© last
Â¦ thirty-four years, died at his home
QJJ in Alameda at 9 o'clock yesterday
morning. The* Immediate cause of
Mr: Russell's death was heart failure, su
perinduced by an attack of paralysis, with
which he .was stricken In November, 1899.
Since the first stroke Mr. Russell never
fully, recovered . hi3 health, although he
returned to his desk for a period of ten
months, shortly after the present Board
of Supervisors took office.
John A. Russell was long identified with the
Masonic ' order in San Francisco, was a past
master of Mount Moriah Ledge No. 44, F. and
A. M. ; a member of California Chapter No. 5,
Royal Arch Masons and of California Coman-.
dery No. 1, Knights Templar.
John' A. Russell's wife was a Miss Bevlns,
daughter of John A. Bevins, one of the prom
inent citizens . of San Francisco in his time.
They made their home on Telegraph Hill, where
Mr. Russell was one of the first settlers. "They
had four children â one son, John A. Russell
Jr., who died four years ago, .and three daugh
ters, Mrs. Dr. Edward A. Younger, Mrs. Edgar
Fainter and Miss Ado Russell, who, t with their
mother,- survive him.
â¢ Fcr some years after his first assumption of
the office each new administration would have
some new man "slated" for the position of
Chief . Clerk, but would soon find the services
of Clerk Russell to be Indispensable and re
elect him to the position.
Mr. Russell was gifted with a special apti
tude for his work, and with a good memory,
and systematic habits he soon became one of.
the best posted men on municipal affairs in the
country, and was recognized as an authority on
all questions pertaining thereto.
Of his kindness and affability, both in and
out of his office, too much cannot be said. He
was respected and beloved by all the public, as
well as his friends and family. " -
Disappointed, , but not disheartened, by this
piece of bad faith Russell lost no time In find
ing other, employment. Still fond of the sea he
choee the water front as his Held and engaged
for a time as a stevedore. Soon he was made
secretary of the Riggers' and Stevedores' As
sociation, which position he was holding when.
In I860, he was selected by the late James W.
Bingham.then Chief Clerk of the Board of Su
pervisors, to be his assistant. Mr. Blngham
died on April 23, 1868, and Mr. Russell was the
following day made his successor, with Thomas
H. Reynolds as his deputy. From that time
until his death, thirty-four years, Mr. Russell's
service as Chief Clerk of the legislative body
of the I city was continuous. He was a strong
factor In modeling the laws and t ordinances
under which San Francisco has grown from a
small ; haphazard governed town to a proud
and powerful municipality, now already aspir
ing to soon reckon her half-million of popula
tion. . "
He had succeeded in building up. quit* a
profitable trade, when, one day his partner
sailed away.' with their vessel and was never
heard of. axaln. . ,
In his eighteenth year he came by way of
Cape Horn to the newly discovered gold fields
of California, arriving at San Francisco early
in 1&50. Leaving the sea he journeyed up to
the placer mines of Calaveras County and went
to digging. He had a. fair run of luck as
things went then and by. the end of the season
had' accumulated a few thousand dollars In
cold dust. â¢ Â¦
Toward the end of the year he paid a visit
to San Francisco, and while here saw an op
portunity for a profitable enterprise. .
He had never been so fully enamored with
a miner's life as to make him forget his first
love â the sea â and he concluded to remain
here near it. He Invested a good part of his
money In a small sloop and with a partner
set about supplying the need of San Francisco
for fresh eggs by gathering those of the sea
fowl on the Faral!one3 and selling them to the
dealers and restaurant men of the city.
John A. Russell was born In Edinburgh,
Scotland, in 1832. He had already received a
good grounding in the â¢ schools of his native
town when. ' while yet a mere boy, he went
to sea. This , life he followed for about five
years ' durinsr which time he visited many of
the great seaports of both hemispheres and
gained a knowledge of affairs and an experience
with men that stood him In good etead in after
life.

JOHN A. RUSSELL'S LIFE.
To-day Rich lies in . the .Walla Walla
jail, and may go to the penitentiary. He
dwelt In remote Coppie" Canyon,: In the
hills twenty miles from here, with a
woman named Ostrander.' Angered at a
neighbor squatter he shot the latter's cat
tle and was Jailed. Then he led an at
tempted jail break, and now is on bread
and water In a dungeon. Meanwhile the
mother and father In the East mourn him
as dead. No one has told them that "the
bad man of Coppie Canyon," or "Giant
Jack Andrews," is their, son Charles,
while no one here knew that "Giant Jack"
was of wealthy , Eastern stock until to
day. Rich, alias Andrews, will be tried
in the Superior Court this. month.
To-day it was discovered that John An
drews was Charles Rich and that he had
deliberately deceived his numerous Penn
sylvania relatives and prompted all the
information given out. It was because he
got into trouble here and wanted to save
his mother from the shame of knowing
it that the wandering son took this
course. Masquerading as Andrews, he
wrote back that Rich had lived forty-five
minutes after the explosion, ami that his
last thought was of his mother and his
last words "E>on't tell'her.".
WALLA : WALLA, Jan. 4.â Two years
ago Charles Rich, the son of wealthy
Philadelphia parents, left home to seek
his fortune in the West. Â¦ Last fall the
parents received letters from John An
drews of this place, saying that' Charles
Rich had been blown up in a* thresher ex
plosion in the Palouse country. Through
Thomas N. Berry of 2511 Patton street,
Philadelphia, the parents investigated and
found corroborative evidence that Rich
was killed. . . ' .' 'â¢Â¦â¢' Â¦

Justice of the Peace Long gave Judg
ment yesterday In favor of Miss Martha
Schwartzberg, who was sued by Harry
Spiegel for X180. alleged to be due him for
services and materials furnished. Spiegel
testified that he was to have had a share
of the profits of a candy store at 201
O'Farrell street, which was purchased by
Miss Schwartzberg, and that. Incident
ally, he was to have married the lady.
Miss Schwartzberg testified that her
fiance had drawn on the finances of the
concern and had reimbursed himself for
a loan to her of $25. A. Lefkowitz, who
said he was a "matchmaker" In the way
of bringing- loving couples together for
the matrimonial yoke, corroborated Sple-
Kel's testimony, but Judge Long- found
lor the fair defendant. " .ââ¢Â¦Â¦ . -

FECTED FOR TAPPING
THE ELECTJ&TC WIRES
The ball which was to have been given
by Company C. formerly I, of the First
Infantry has been indefinitely postponed
on account of the death of General Sea
mans.
The Marlon has been hauled into the
stream to permit of certain repairs being
made to the wharf where she ties up.
Gn Tuesday next work for the season will
commence, and Captain Nerney says that
it will be kept up â¢with spirit and vigor
until the next vacation.
Active work in the First Infantry com
mences this week, and an effort will be
made to bring the sinking regiment to
the front again. A movement to increase
the membership of a. number of the com
panies will be started, and another wll!
be in the matter of securing an additional
company, so as to make the regiment a
three-battalion organization. It Is feared
that if something is not done, and that
soon, "the gallant First" will drop out of
sight.
The companies of the Fifth Infantry
will enter upon active routine work this
week, and about the 15th of the month
the field officers' school will be opened.
The class will be Instructed by Colonel
Whitton and Lieutenant Colonel Hayes.
This Is the first time in the history of the
regiment that it has had such a school.
The regiment is waiting for an answer to
the request to be permitted to hold a reg
imental camp this year.
There is considerable talk In National
Guard circles at this time about the pos
sible successor to the late W. H. Seamans
in the office of adjutant general of the
State. In local circles there seems to be
a hope that the Governor will appoint As
sistant Adjutant General Bangham, as he
has done nearly all the work of the office
during the last three years and Is well up
as to the condition of the guard and its
necessities. Captain Jensen of Troop A
is raid to be a candidate for the office,
and there are some who say that Colonel
Burgin of the^ Second Brigade staff would
not be averse to accepting the title of
brigadier general, which goes with the of
fice of adjutant general.

The Southern Pacific Railroaa Company
applied to the Superior Court yesterday
for an injunction restraining the Board
of Railroad Commissioners from enforcng
the schedule of rates for transporting oil
In Fresno and Kern 1 counties adopted by
the board last month. The rates objected
to by the Southern Â¦ Pacific Company 'are
the result of a suit brought by John Le
Blanc, an oil man. of Kern County, .last
April. The petition will be , heard before
Judge Hebbard. :*
The railroad company alleges that 'the
rates afpresent In force, which according
to the papers filed in the suit brought by
Le Blanc are excessive, are so low now
that there, is little profit, if any,' for. the
company in transporting the oil. ; Accord-

WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.â The following
Calif ornians ' have arrived at . the hotels :

mento; William Jarvis, E. L. â¢ Jones and
L. G. Carpenter, San Francisco. Shore

Physicians say. that swinging Is health
ful exerciseâ yet many a poor fellow has
met his death thereby.
His plan is a simple one.. He would enforce an examination upon every applicant for
a stage career, and permit no man or woman to appear- before the footlights who could not per
form up to the standard. Next he would subject play-writers and managers to a r censorship.
They, like the performers, would also have .to pass, an examination. A man who could riot prop
erly answer questions as to the true purposes of the â¢ theater and the rightful ends of dramatic
work-would' not be permitted to conduct a theater.' In short., the gentleman aims .to give New-
York City a civil service stage, and the country will be well pleased if the -Legislature give the
thing a .trial. It. is : time that 1 something were . done, and since expostulation has been in vain a
statute may be effective. :
:_Jt is hardly necessary to say that, the- legisfat^ who has undertaken the work hails from a
rural district. He has been to .the big ..city, has seen the show and has returned convinced 'that
the : stage needs the kind of purification that : Mayor , Low . is going to apply to Tammany* Hall. He
has thought out the various problems involved in the proposed reform and has prepared a bill
providing what he deems. a true remedy for every ill that affects the' American stage.
A CTORS, moralists, preachers, critics, scholars and some prize-fighters have each in
/\ their various" ways sought to elevate the stage. The press and the public, have watched
/ \ their efforts with sympathy and have frequently found occasion to applaud. , Sometimes
/ *" they have even found occasion to hope. All, however, has been in vain. The stage has
remained at the same level, or it may even have sunk a little. There have been times when it
seemed as if the "legitimate'' would become a side show and the vaudeville would -be the main
thing. Under such circumstances it is gratifying to know that a new reformer has arisen. He is
a member of the New York Legislature, and he announces that if his bill becomes a law it will
elevate the stage of New YorkCity as thoroughly as the civil service law has elevated . the tone
and temper of those departments of political administration where it has been applied:

PERSONAL MENTION.
'r B * HE first of the new 6tars that will
I twinkle in the Tivoll firmament
3 when comic opera returns is Har-
I old Gordon, a lyric tenor with a
* voice of unusually fine quality. Mr.
Gordon is a native of Boston and
has an encouraging musical history.
He was the pupil of Sbrielia, who
taught Jean de Reszke the few things
nature left untaught, and is a lyric
tenor of the heavier kind. He has
had experience both In Boston and
New York. For some time he sang with
the Castle Square Opera Company, also
with the Kurwen Opera Company and
with the Southwell Opera Company. 'Mr.
Gordon has not confined himself to comic
opera, but has achieved success as Ra
dames in "Aida," as Don Jose in "Car
men" and in other grand opera roles.
The singer will be first heard here in
"The Ameer," that will follow "Little Red
Riding Hood" when the present furor for
Hartman's pleasant extravaganza has
died down. Besides "The Ameer," other
comic opera favorites Â¦ to be given are
"The Fortune Teller." "The Serenade"
and "The Singing Girl." and by a com
pany that will be distinguished from most
comic opera companies by being able to
sing. â¢ The voice limit is usually repre
sented- by 0 In the light opera bands that
are visited upon us, except with such as
the Perley people and they don't, come
around as often as they might But the
home company will have voice, fun and
good looks, down from principals to. cho
rus this year, that can give most travel-
Ing companies "cards and spades." Mr.
Gordon, as before eald, is the tenor, Ar
thur Cunningham's good baritone is as
favorably as it is well known, and Schus
ter has been mentioned as the basso. Then
there is Edward "Webb among the. come
dians, with a thoroughly pleasing organ,
and Ferris Hartman' and Harry Cashman,
whose â¢ voices are never mentioned, . but
who are funsmlths of the first order.
Anna Llchter is to be the soprano prima
donna, which fact ensures the soprano
.roles a thoroughly musical presentment;
Â¦ Frances Graham, the handsome contralto,
; will again lend her beautiful voice to light
opera, and Annie Myers, the fetching sou
brette, will be another indispensable mem
ber of the. company. Meantime,' "Little
Red Riding Hood" still holds sway, with
Robert Drouet was by much the best,
the only Armand that has been seen here.
It is easy to believe from his performance
the little story as to why he lost his place-
In the company he was In before h*
adorned Miss Mannering's. "They say"
that in spite of his subordinate position
in the drama in which he was appearing
Mr. . Drouet by sheer weight of natural
brilliance so far outshone the star as
quite to dim ; her luster.' This would not
have mattered only that the Impertinent
public recognized the fact So ho lost
his place. i
. Mr. Drouet' s Armand was a masterly.

It Is high time some one came up to fill
the place. I suggest Mary Mannering.
FAMOUS ACTRESS WHO WILL'
BE SEEN AT THE COLUMBIA
. THEATER.
The problem should not be left to the risk of a hasty solution in . the way of; municipal
water works undertaken in a hurry. Capital should be interested in the subject at once. At the
present time there is an abundance of unemployed money in the East seeking permanent profit
able investment. No better investment offers 'than thatof supplying San Francisco. with -moun
tain water, nor will there ever be in the. future a better time for making the investment. .
It is of course altogether probable we shall have the desired rainfall. Many -a dry season
'at, this time of the year, has given place to a season of abundant rains later on. While, however,
there is nothing about which to be alarmed, it will belworth while for the far-seeing men of the
community to ..consider the future. The population of San Francisco is 'increasing. The demand
and the need for water will be larger, every year. The local rainfall of the winter cannot be relied
upon always to supply, the year's needs of so populous a community as is now growing up
all round the bay. Sooner or later, we must bring water from the mountains where the flow is
abundant at all seasons; and the sooner we do so the better, /v _....
A correspondent of The Gall in a thoughtful article published Saturday says: "The writer
personally knows from an examination of the San Mateo reservoirs and the records of the reservoirs
and- water supplies as declared by H. Schussler, chief engineer of the company, 'that there is not
: now water enough in these reservoirs used together with air the company can get from Alameda
L County and. Lake Merced to supply the city through the current year- â also that a rainfall of not
less than 15 inches in San Francisco before April 1 will be required to make up the deficiency.".
SUCH citizens of San Francisco as are averse to, giving any consideration : to the water
, supply of the city until thejneed" of 'a better \ supply becomes 1 urgent may find. in the
present prolonged spell. of dry weather a sufficient reason for interesting^ themselves in
the subject at once. The, present water supply of the city is dependent upon the rainfall
in this locality from season to season, and the absence of rain may yet precipitate upon the
people a water, famine of a very- serious nature. -

JlO.OOO-for the best "one-act opera, in any

it was by the kindly offices of Signor Son

opera, "Cavalleria Rustlcana," winning
the first Sanzogno prize. some years ago.
This is well, worth .remembering, by the

the handsome prize of $10,000, but the cer

that it means immediate fame and almost

only the awakening of public spirit to the

"Who Is Barnum?"

Such a system, underrigid official oversight, it is believed, will amply protect? the public
and serve its convenience. In the; discussion of the banking law the people have, been meas
urably educated but of some popular illusions about banks. The; idea was once quite general,
and still prevails in some sections, that a bank is an injurious institution which- makes money
scarce by hoarding it. It has; come to be known now that, among the misfortunes that a bank
shuns, is the. idleness of its 'capital which compels hoarding. If a bank loaned' no money,. sold â¢
no exchange, discounted no paper, it would be, in exactly the same fix as if its capital had been
lost and its doors closed by insolvency.' . '..;'...": -
'A better understanding of the use and principles of banking is one of ttie useful results of
the campaign of financial education which began in 1896. The people know more about banks,
and among them there has started a movement that has been taken 'up by Congressman McCleary
of Minnesota and put on the inquiry list for investigation.
/ Under the law as it stands national banks must loan their funds on personal security only.
This is based upon sound principles, which require that a commercial bank shall' keep its assets
in a form of security that is readily controvertible. It is this principle which stands against the
emission, of a credit currency directly by the Government. The Government has only two ways
of getting the specie required to make such currency good, by: making it always immediately
redeemable. in actual value. One of these is by taxation, the other by borrowing. The first is too .
slow, the second too costly. Â¦. The- system was exposed in all its. dangers during the panic of
1893, when the greenbacks ran into the treasury for specie redemption until it was empty, and the
Government had to borrow gold on its bonds to avoid suspension of specie payments and
national. bankruptcy. . The inquiry undertaken by Mr. McCleary is intended to develop how .
far this N principle may.be departed from in the case of national banks, by permitting them to loan
a fixed percentage of their funds upon realty security.; * ; . \
It is proposed to limit* this permission to small banks, whose patrons are rural people,
owners. of realty and needful of borrowed capital. ' ;;â¢-"Â¦ *
Loaning on realty is the proper function of savings banks, which' look for a more perma
nent form of security. Theyare not subject to some of the emergencies that beset commercial
institutions. The law benefits them by a time limit, to which they may subject depositors, and
within which. they may realize on realty securities. , V
Extending the proposed permission to commercial banks must' be carefully considered in
its probable effect upon them, by impairing their power to meet emergencies, and . also in its
effect upon savings banks. These are the trustees of the people, who are benefited by their
power to earn interest. Permitting national banks to enter the field of realty security may impair
that power to the injury of savings depositors.
Against this last consideration it may well be urged that people in cities have ready access
to both kinds of banks, while country people, have only commercial banks to resort to for accom
modation. The subject is of great, interest, and it is evident that Mr. McCleary intends to ap
proach it conservatively/ It will be interesting to know-how the national bankers the'mselves
â¢regard it. S^I^SS' â¢' : - .-/;,'Â¦%''
DISCUSSION of changes in the national banking system has gone far beyond, the orig
'â¢;., irial "propositions, which were lowering the minimum capital to $25,000 and providing
an elastic currency, by permitting the : issue of notes on assets . other than Government
bonds. The latterhas . not yet been effected. It is of great interest to all â¢ business
. men, remote from the financial centers, because it will provide an emergency currency that will
not congest in those centers,; but will serve its temporary purpose and flow back into the bank"
which emits it.

The Bakersfleld Calif ornlan makes an
annual review of- the operations in tho
Kern River district. The statement Is
summarized by saying that during â¢ the
year 1901 there was an increase in the
district of 243 producing wells in eleven
sections. Outside of these sections about
seventy-five other wells have been com
pleted, in twelve months. There has been
a marked advancement in the district dur
ing the year, notwithstanding the slump
in prices for oil.- Where there were only
the beginnings of pipelines at the opening
of, 1901 there is now a perfect network ot
such lines. Railroad spurs :have been run
to many sections. Loading facilities have
been provided. The operations of the
Standard Oil Company. In. the district have
been on a large scale. That company has,
according .to the figures,
6800 carloads of oil from the district stored
at -Tank City. The Californian: says:, .
An Annual Review.'
From this date Interest will . attach
closely to the Associated Oil Company.
The talk of a pool of other companies
that have not merged in the Associated
Oil Company seems to have . come to an
end. In the immediate future* the work
of the Associated Company will be to the
end of improving prices. The combina
tion of so many large companies into one
does away with the competition in which
they have been engaged. They , are not
therefore an element in the cutting of
prices. The Kern County, companies that
are outside the combine, or that have not
decided. to ;come in when^all the prelim
inaries are arranged, are very few.
There are some who have imagined that
when the Associated Oil Company was in
corporated the work was well in hand.
As a matter of fact, it was then only be
gun.- The project depended upon the
merging of large producing oil companies
in the Associated Company. This waa
attended with difficulties, but the solid
arguments that were advanced by the
promoters made their way and insured the
merging of properties, as announced ex
clusively in The Call; .'
The actual beginning. of operations ,by
the Associated Oil Company has brought
the oil .industry of California to another
and highly interesting phase. The great
combination began its .work on the first
working day of the present year.' For
many months there has been uncertainty
in various' quarters as to whether the
promoters of the Associated Oil Company
would succeed In gathering in the great
oil producing companies of the region
north of Tehachapi. .Up to the very .-last
of the old year the- insiders kept their
own counsels well. When the deeds Â»had
passed for the properties that have 3,000,
000 barrels of oil to deliver under annual
contracts already made, and there was no
longer any doubt of the wisdom of pro
ceeding actively, the company made its
announcement. â¢ Â¦ :. â Â¦ '

A.U. LCivS CSe
At the annual meeting of the California
Teachers' Association held in Pacific

Superintendent Hugh Baldwin of San
Diego County, Superintendent J. W. Lins

C. Van Llew of the State Normal School
at Chico and Richard D. Faulkner of the
Franklin Grammar School of San Fran
cisco. â¢â¢-",Â¦ *'â¢Â¦.'.
The committee will act under the fol
lowing resolution adopted " at Pacific
Grove: i' . .,":
Whereas. It Is deeded expedient that the
teachers of thle State organize eo that they
may act as a unit In order to secure much
needed reforms In methods of school work, in
order to make the profession of teaching more
attractive, to the end that Â¦more men and
women of ability will choose teaching as a
life work, and in ordfr to secure the enact
ment of Iaw5 which will make the public school
â¢sj-Rtem of more practical value to the masses
of the people: therefore, be it
Ttpsolved. By the California Teachers' Asso

day. He was sentenced to two years in
Folscm Penitentiary. On October 31 he
broke open a tool chest In a new build
ing, -To Guerrero street, and stole a num
ber of tools belonging to Joseph Paganinl,
a car:Â»entcr.
The Judge in dismissing the cases said
it was an outrage to have arrested the
defendants. It was clear to him from the
testimony of disinterested witnesses that
Mrs. Kilbourne was- very much under the
influence of liquor that evening and she
had made so many contradictory state
ments that her testimony was unreliable.
There was nothing proved against the
character, of the defendants and he had
no hesitation In dismissing the cases.
The cases of Frank Morrissey and Mar
tin J. Flynn. charged with robbery and
attempted assault, were dismissed by
Judge Mogan yesterday. Thomas Crouch,
who was also arrested on the same
charges, was acquitted on Thursday. The
complaining witness was Mrs. Ruse Kil
bourne of Santa Rosa.
and Martin J. Flynn Are Dis

WASHINGTON, Jan. 4. â Assistant Secretary
of the Treasury H. A. Taylor will retain his
position under Governor Shaw, the new Seere
tary of the Treasury. The retention of Mr.
Taylor waa agreed upon at the consultation be
tween the President and members of the Wis
consin delegation.
enelneers In makinc a survey of that field,
after -mt exhaustive Investigation, based upon
an analysis of the oil sand and the relative
amount of saturation, as well as the extent of
the -oil sand ns determined by the extensive
explorations that -have been. made, arrived at
the conclusion that there Is oil remaining un
derground comauted at 1.185.000,000 barrels,
approximately twelve hundred million barrels.
The present oil consumption in California -was
also investigated and found to be about 0,000.
000 barrels annually. An annual consumption
of such an amount will require 200 years to
consume the amount of oil believed to be
stored In the underground reservoirs of the
Kern River field. It thus. appears that this
field alone is capable of supplying California
with fuel oil for the next hundred years, and
that after allowing: double the amount of the
present consumption. And this oil Is produced
cheaply. Â¦ â¢ Â¦_
Politicians of the Democratc party who
happen to livo in Lob Angeles do Â¦ not
speak of Synder with glowing enthusiasm.
Down in that region of the State Wash
ington Dodge is regarded as the real
Moses, but hereabouts Synder. Is exalted
as the leader. There seems to bo a fine
opening for Dick Beamer to butt in for
the leadership, as the city candidates ap

Franklin K. Lane, City Attorney of San
Francisco, called on Mayor Snyder In Los
Angeles a few days ago. The Herald as

Speculation is rife around the City Hall
as to whether the Intended programme to
appoint Charles Fay to the
caused. by Mr. Russell's death will be car
ried, out to-morrow. Many expressions of
disapproval are heard * over. Pnelan's
scheme to appoint a successor to a man
who lay on his deathbed. It is said that
a clerk of the board must be elected on
next Monday when the board meets, as
no official business could be transacted
unless a clerk had qualified. None of the
Supervisors . would discuss the matter
when. seen on the subject, but in all like
lihood a successor to the late clerk will
be appointed at once.'

OnÂ© Important change in Mayor-elect
Schmltz's: slate for the commissions will
be made. A. Gruenberg will not go on
the Police Commission. The latest deci
sion places H. W. Hutton on the slate for
the Police Board. In order to extend rec
ognition to Gruenberg further revision
may become necessary. The City Front
Federation strongly advocated Hutton's
appointment and the pressure was- so,
great that the Mayor-elect was con
strained to change the list. Hutton is a
Republican and Judge. William T. Wal
lace, whose term will expire on January 8
next, is a well known Democrat. The
Democratic party, however, will have
representation on the board In the per
son of Commissioner Mahony, even lf
Schmitz should appoint a Republican to
succeed i Wallace. J. A. Drinkhouse's
name has been considered and the claims
of Michael Casey have received consider
ation. It is known that Mr. Drinkhouse
is earnestly supported by men who . are
clcse to Mr. Schmitz. Mr. Casey is also
strongly indorsed and assurances' are
given that he would -accept the office of
Police Commissioner if it were tendered
to him. :Â¦..'??<.>:'<â¢ .

Registrar Walsh has prepared some in
teresting information regarding the
changes which will result from the appor
tionment of the city into new Assembly
districts, which went Into effect January
1, 1902./
The hold-over .State. Senators are J. M.
Plunkett, Seventeenth District; Richard
J. Welch, Nineteenth; Edward I. Wolfe.
Twenty-first; John G. Tyrrell. Twenty
third, and J. H. Nelson. Twenty-fifth. The
outgoing Senators, S representing the
Eighteenth, Twentieth. Twenty-second
and Twenty-fourth districts, are R. Por
ter Ashe, S. Bettman. John A. Hoey and
F. W. Burnett. Under the reapportlon
ment several hold-over Senators repre
sent territory that was not embraced in
their ' districts when they were â¢ chosen.
Wolfe and Tyrrell, for instance, represent
voters who took no part in their election.
The inclination to move out of a district
represented, by Wolfe may. be strong, but
the expense of moving is considerable. No
Senator is to be elected this year south of
Market, east; of Eleventh . and- north of
Drannan streets, the. old Thirtieth As-
Bembly District having been entirely shut
out. The Mission elects two Senators, the
Western Addition gets one and the down
town districts one. The new Fortieth and
Forty-first Assembly districts are added
to the Fourth Congressional District, hav
ing been transferred from the Fifth. The
Thirty-second Assembly District is trans
ferred from the Fourth to the Fifth Con
gressional District.' Clever . scheming In
the interest of Julius Kahn was done at
Sacramento.'

will open headquarters and organize

consider such subjects as the Chinese ex

Alert politicians are scheming to gain
some advantage at the annual convention
of the California State Federation of La
bor. The convention will meet at Vallejo
to-morrow. It is expected that three'hun

tend. Agitation is caused by rumors that
an effort will be made to force the adop
tion of a resolution commending Governor
Gage. It is said that plans have been
cleverly formed to spring a resolution of
this character. While the adherents of
Gage are planning the Democratic poli
ticians are interesting themselves in. tho
affafrs of the coming, session. A Demo
cratic-syndicate with money to burn is
supposed to be taking a hand. The story
goes that delegates have been assured'
that all their traveling and hotel^. expenses
will be paid and provision made for , a

never allowed to enter, and where love is the only law. Mill m\ i^j^
Poverty keeps many from marriage, but their number is small JnIS^^^'^** 16 * 3 ""^ l i
compared to that mighty host of unfortunates who are victims of that "'.
heinous disease, Contagious Biood Poison, and shut on t from the enj^yinent of matrimanal happiness. Riches in plenty,
social position, and the highest honors may have been won, but all these would the unnappy lover exchange for health and
the assurance that no symptoms of this loathsome malady would ever come back; that no taint of this black sin remained
in his blood to be transmitted to posterity or blight the life of the one he has promised to love and protect.
r j, : Contagious' Blood Poison has brought more misery into the world than all other diseases combined. There is no limit
to its powers for evil ; happy homes are broken up, and confidence and affection turned to distrust and hatred by this slimy,
hissing serpent. So highly contagious and treacherous is Â¦ * â¢Â¦Â¦ â¢!â¢ r*>
this disease and so surely transmitted to others that.those PatFCIYtS Responsibility vireftt
whose blood has been polluted by this awful virus may well .
pause and considerâ is it safe for me to venture? Will my marriage bring happiness, or degradation, suffering and shame?
Often-times all evidences of blood poison disappear andmarriage is contracted under the mistaken belief that all
danger of contaminating others is past, but your dream of happiness is rudely disturbed when you behold the return of the
disease, and the pure and, innocent wife must share your shame, and the weakly little infant bear upon its body the marks
of this loathsome malady.
Whoever relies on Mercury and Potash as a cure for Contagious Blood Poison takes desperate chances, for these drugs
cover up and mask the symptoms but drive the poison deeper into the blood and system, where it feeds upon some vital organ
and periodically breaks out upon the skin. The effect of Mercury and Potash upon the system is simply terrible. They
eat out the lining of the Stomach and destroy the gastric juices, producing a bad form of dyspepsia. They also penetrate
the bones and muscles, when Rheumatism and offensive sores are the result. Salivation often follows their use, and the teeth
and gums become so sore^ that solid food cannot be taken, and the body wastes -away for want of nourishment. We have a
standing offer of $ijooo for proof that S. S. S. contains one single mineral ingredient. It is a combination of vegetable alter-
atives and tonics that make it beyond all question the purest and safest of air blood purifiers. For many years S. S. S. has
.^^m^. *>^^^^. been recognized as a Specific for Contagious Blood Poison, and a perfect antidote for the virus
if>rfB^ri B| H^J M^"^^k ma k es this disease so terrible and far reaching in its effects upon the 'human system.
\ U V'^b^^^ * a thoroughly and completely does S. S. S. cure this disease that no recurring
symptoms are ever seen,, and the blood is ! made as pure and strong as before the taint of
&*wZ^ fc^-%-1 fc^I_'Ii -J fearful curse entered. It will cure you and remove all danger of transmitting to future
C!!^^^r h^^^^f P oster^ t y blood poison in any of its varied forms, and its use will bring back health to
those you have unwillingly infected, and your home be made as bright and cheerful as
heart could wish, and your dream of happiness becomes a living reality.
We will gladly help through our Medical Department those who write us about their case. Our physicians have had
large experience in treating Contagious Blood Poison, and you can have the benefit of their skill without charge. Self treat-
ment book, containing valuable -information about this disease, will be sent free.

Matters of Interest to Mariners and
NEWS OP THE OCEAN.
T-VTO mall boats saileji yesterday,
one with Honolulu as her final,
destination, the other to stop
there. While ostensibly neither
Is trying to make Honolulu first,
still the first vessel there will have , a rec
ord. Tee captain of the America. Maru,
which sailed at 1 p. m., had orders to
make regular time* while .the. captain of
the Alameaa, which sailed at 2- p. mÂ«,
was ordered not to out-do . his sched
ule speed, and burn , no _ more coal than
necesBary. It was a question of â¢; owner
versus master and engineer all aloug the
line. On the America Maru 'the captain
was told that 4f he raced he would losÂ«
bis position. ThÂ© "Alameda 1 ar captain and
chief engineer were told that every pound
of coal they burned over the regulation
allowance would be charged up against
them and that the company was absor
lutely against racing. Â¦ " .- ..
In spite of all these orders the America"
ilaru went out througn the Heads like
a white streak, while the Alameda fol
lowed her at full speed an hour later on
"a hind chase." Chief Engineer Horgan
of the Alameda and Chief Engineer
Thomson of the America Maru have ex
plicit orders to run on schedule time, but
the betting is 2 to 1 that every man in
the fireroom of the Alameda and Amer
ica Maru is working like a beaver to
make time on the run to Honolulu.
The America Maru has little to gain !n
the run. as she can carry neither pas
sengers nor freight from San Francisco
to the Hawaiian Islands. She is the
crack flier of the Toyo Risen Kaisha
line and can reel off her thirteen knots
day in and day out without any trouble.
On account of the "stopover" privileges
she has to stop at Honolulu, and that is
Â¦why she calls at that port. The Alameda,
however, is the mail steamship and that
is her only port of call. The latter has
been refitted and remodeled and is now a
fast ship, but Captain Herrlman Bays he
can't race, while Captain Going says it
means instant dismissal to make more
than the regular time Nevertheless
there's a race on.

Bombarding: a stomach with hot bis-
cuits and warm pie, plenty of butter,
fcacca, greasy potatoes, and' a few other
choice delicacies will â¢ finally : cause . the
fortifications to give way. Then" how to
build back on good food is worth knowing:.
| a. m&n In â¢ FactoryrlUe, Pa., attacked
tils stomach In about this way and' says:
''The sign of. surrender was.plainin'my
vrhlte, colorless- face. At that time every
article of food distressed me, and 'heart-
burn kept me in continued misery.. I
liked all sorts of breakfast foods, but they
flld not agree with me. Of course, much
of tho food that I ate contained nourish-
ment, bat my Btomach could not get the
BOTiriEfcmeat out. I tried pepsin and other
Hds to digestion which worked for a time
and then gave out.
"Finally I reasoned, when In an extrem-
ity, that If the Btomach could not digest
the food why not take some food that was
(dready digested like Grape-Nats. 'So I
etarted In on Grape-Nuts and the new
food won my palate straight away and
agreed with mo beautifully. '. v
"The heavy, oppressive feeling: r disap-
peared and I became thoroughly Im-
pressed with the new food and began to
improve at once. Little by* little' my
strength camÂ« back and slowly and sure-
ly I gained my lost weight. The wasted
tissues and muscles built up, and to-day
I am well, buoyant and strong.
"I unreservedly give the chief credit, to
Srape-Kuts which met' me In a crisis and
trough t me . over tha dark â¢ period of de-
epondency. Nothing else did It, for noth-
ing else could be endured.
"Please withhold my name."
Name can be given upon application to

: ' Free " trial ' packagea of a most 'reinark-
able remedy, are being mailed to all who

They cured so many men who had battled
for years against the mental and physical
suffering of lost 'manhood that the Insti-
tute has decided to distribute free trial

treatment, and all men who suffer from
any form of sexual weakness resulting
from youthful folly, premature loss of
strength and memory, weak back, varico-
cele or emaciation* of parts can now curs
themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and- development Just where It la needed.
It cures all the ills and troubles that come
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute success in
all cases. A request to the State Medical
Institute.* 32S Elektron building, ; Fort
.Wayne.* Ind., stating that you desire. one
of their ' free trial packages, will , be com-
plied with promptly. The Institute Is de-
sirous of reaching that great class of men
who . are .'unable Â¦ to â¢ leave home to r be
treated, and the free samples will enable
them. to.- see how, easy it Is to be cured of
sexual .weakness when the proper reme-
dies are employed. .The Institute makes
no restrictions..- Any man who writes will
be sent a free sample; carefully, sealed in
a; plain package, so that Its recipient need

the Monroe doctrine. The papers have
partly taken the same view. The Tase

â¢The phrase. 'America for Americans,'
is- an Irreversible fact."
Some newspapers, like the Cologne
Volks Zeitung. a leading Centrist organ,
see in.. Germany's, consultation with the
United States an unnecessary recognition
of the , latter's "pretensions on Central
America," and the paper last named
avers that the representations of the Ger
man Embassador, Dr. von Holleben, at
Washington,- were ' followed by a "freah
outbreak of Insolence upon the part ot
the American press." â¢
Professor Frank Parsons of Boston is
here, j After studying the industrial con
ditions of thirty-six European cities he
found in all countries some apprehension
that the United States is likely to under
sell in all the open markets. He says
Austria especially is feeling insecure, so
much so -that gaeat manufacturers and
financiers are unwilling . to contribute
capital for new ventures except In small
amounts, as the United States is fixing
prices? of rubber goods, â¢ bicycles, soaps,
photographic- materials and several lines
of; machinery. .
Almost equal concern regarding Ameri
can competition exists -in Italy, but- In
Germany Professor Parsons finds that the
manufacturers feei able to take care of
themselves. The thing here that aston
ishes Professor Parsons most is the health
and good spirits- of the men who are
working sixteen and seventeen hour3
dally for sixty and , sixty-five cents per
day under conditions which would not
be tolerated in America. .
Professor Parsons has gone exhaustive
ly into the question of workmen's fond,
and his general conclusion is that while
Germans, Austrians and Italians are
underfed. -Americans are overfed, almost
to gluttony. -- The -professor will go . to
Boston at the end of the present . month.

Ernest Cassel in placing Â£200,000 at the
disposal of King Edward for charitable
cr utilitarian purposes, which sum will
fce devoted to the establishment of a sani

prominently before publia notice one of
the most interesting characters in Eng
land. Comparisons are noV drawn be
tween Andrew Carnegie and Cassel. In
this connection the Spectator says:
"We hope the gift will be the precursor
ef many more. English millionaires do
not behave well in this respectâ far worse
for instance than their American rivals,
â¢who have spent this year Â£25,000.000 in
the endowment of universities, colleges,
libraries and art schools. It is thorough
ly discreditable to us that Oxford and
Cambridge lack a million apiece required
lor their cost equipment."
Sir Ernest Cassel is an instance of those
â¢who have worked from the bottom to the
top rung of English life. He was born
f.fty years ago at Cologne. His father
Â¦was a. German baker. Sir Ernest entered
the London financial house of Benschoffs

Another attempt to take Panama Is
now being planned by the insurgents.
The news is confirmed that their fleet,
consisting of. the gunboats Darien, Pa
dilla and Galtan and a few sailing vessels
carrying cargoes of war material, are in
the vicinity of the isthmus. It is even
reported that some of these have already
been landed. General Benjamin Herrera
is the commander of this expedition.
Dr. Restrepo said to-day that in a few
days he expected to hear of thÂ« renewal
of hostilities at Panama.., ' .
NEW YORK. Jan. 4.-A cablegram to
day from General Vargas Santos, chief
of the Colombian rebellion, to Dr. A. J.
Restrepo, diplomatic agent of the rebels
in this country, announces that General
Rafael Urlbe-Urlbe had effected an 'en
trance into Colombia from Venezuela. . !
Special Dlasatch to The Call.
The Venezuelan Government, according
to the advices from Caracas, Is without
money and is vainly trying to buy war
supplies in New York.
It is further asserted that the employes
of the Government of Venezuela have
been without pay for the last six months
and that they are only awaiting favor
able opportunity to take part in the re
volt against President Castro.
The death penalty has been abolished in
Venezuela and prisoners cannot be legally
executed. Â«
General Rlera, the revolus.
tionary leader who is here, expects to
join in a cotzplo of days about 1500 follow
ers, near Coro, the capital of the State
of Falcon.
Latest advices are that President Cas
tro has been apprised of the arrival of
the Ban Righ on the Venezuelan coast,
and has sent a couple of war vessels to
capture her.
The decree of President Castro declar
ing that the steamship Ban Righ Is a
piratical craft is regarded here as likely
to result in an increase of international
complications. Should the Ban Righ be
captured and the ship's company exe
cuted, it will be a case of the Virginius
ever again.
There are on the Ban Righ four Ameri
cans, five Frenchmen, three . Englishmen
end three Cubans, all of whom are under
command of Venezuelans. The assertion
that the Ban Righ is a pirate is consid
ered absurd.
It is said that the vessels of the Vene
zuelan fleet are short of coal, that their
engines are in need of repair and that the
search for the Ban Righ was very lim
ited.
Another report has reached here that
the Ban High anchored last evening at
"Machurucuto, about sixty miles west of
Guzman Blanco.
.Venezuelan coast, near Guzman Blanco,
port of Barcelona, and has landed Senor
Mat os and his revolutionary expedition.
WTT-LP^TSTAD, Jan. 4.â Advices have
reached here that the steamship Ban
High, cow called the Libertador by the
Venezuelan insurgents, has arrived on the

Allen and MacGavin defeated Tobin and
Harry Haight In a slow game by a score
of six to two. In a second match
between Taylor and Allen and Haight and
Tobin the latter team redeemed them
selves by winning a fast contest, 6â3.
What proved the best match of the day
was between Tobin and Taylor and

team securing one set, 6â3 and 6 â 0, re
spectively. . Some clever net work by
Taylor and Tobin and terrinc driv

Play in the concluding rounds of the
New Year's tournament will be called at
10:30 o'clock this morning:.
Allen Is expected to make a strong bid
for honors In to-day's tournament, when
the final rounds of the New Tear's
event will be concluded. His opponent,
R. N. Whitney, is conceded to be a much
better player under ordinary conditions;
.but with the handicap of "half thirty"
which he allows his opponent it Is ex
pected the contest will be. replete with
brilliant strokes.
The match in to-day's play-off between
MacGavin and Brown Is creating some in
terest, /as both players are evenly
matched. On past occasions when they
have opposed each other they have played
a star game.
In last year's try-out at the University

Full Moon, at 1 to 5, laid off and lost
to Dread Not. In a long, hard race Alice
Louise beat Boodle Boy at 1 to 3, and
then Thelma, through lavor of the hare,
outworked the stake possibility. Freda C,
at 1 to 6. Rich Argosy's defeat of Black
Flush at 1 to 3, St.' Ives' quick victory
over Hickory Dick, and Fannie Hughie
outgaining Real Article at 1 to 2, added
more misery to â¢ the lot of the men of
money.
Rosle Freedom was the first to â¢ break
the monotony for the pikers. Petronius
was her opponent, and the wise ones fig
ured him an easy winner. Five -to one
was auoted that he would outpoint the
fast daughter of For Freedom, but that
somewhat "erratic - performer was in
coursing humor and took the flag with
out allowing Petrdnius to score!
In the nineteenth trial Elista out
worked Chicago Boy, a 1 to 2 choice.
From that time the talent had to weather
a hard storm. Every second course re
sulted contrary -to the' judgment of the
wise ones, and in several instances were
expensive enough to be annoying. .

SUMMARY.
. In the fourth inning the first three men
up were safe, tilling the bases. âBy clever
work the Nationals prevented them from
scoring. Sullivan flew to deep center and
the ball was lielded so well the man on
thJrd remained there as if anchored. Bern
Â¦ hard struck out and Pickering flew out.
Â¦ The Nationals did not score until the
fifth inning, when they bunched their hits
and sent three men home. Beckley was
safe at first; Steinfeldt hit past shortstop,
een31ng Beckley to third. McHale hit
over second, scoring Beckley and Stein
feldt. Schmidt was out at f rst on a sac
rifice hit. Van Haltren singled, scoring
McHaie. Hulea retired , the side, going
out at first.
Beckley scored. the last run of the game
for the Nationals in the seventh. He sent
the ball out to the housetop at center
field. It dropped back into the lot and he
made only two bases on the hit. McHaie
hit to shortstop, who fielded it home to
head off Beckley. The latter ran back
tow.ird third. In throwing the ball Sulli
van hit Beckley with It and it rolled off
toward shortstop. He sent it to the plate.
Bernhard, who was "backing up" Sulli
van, dropped it, allowing Beckley to score.
The score:

The Â»A1I-Americas started well, scoring
their two runs in the first inning. Picker
ing, the first man up. was given a pass:
Barrett, the reliable, singled and went to
second on Van Haltren's error. Fraser
hit safely, scoring Pickering. Fraser
thought he could reach second ahead of
the ball, but he failed. Lajoie lined out
a two-bagger, sending Barrett home. The
next two men went out, retiring the side.
In the fourth inning, with the bases full
and no one out, the All-Americas could
not score owing to the clever .fielding of
the Nationals. There were an unusual
number of brilliant catches during the
game. JtcHale, Chance. Van Haltren and
Barrett being the principal performers.
Lajoie made his first error since he came
to this city. He also struck out. To off
set this he had four putouts and five as
sists to his credit.
There were several thrills in the base
ball game at Recreation Park yesterday
jsetween the Nationals and the All-Amer
icas. The former won by a score of 4 to 2.

With The Giver scratched from the
fourth event, it left a practical walkover
for Waterscratch. The chestnut was held
a 1 to 5 chance and won hard held from
Legal Maxim and San Â»Lution. Senator
Bruce was. the only other starter. "
â¢ Foucon, the- old-time- rider, made his
debut as a hurdle rider in this part of
the . country and piloted the winner in
Finch, a 10 to 1 shot. Foucon , took the
outsider out in front from : the time the
barrier was released and finished more
than a length before. Duke, of York, the
second choice, at the. wire. At the first
jump "Stew" Peters, -astride Phil Archi
bald, the favorite, was bumped and un
seated, but managed to climb back into
the saddle. His . chances, however, were
ruined. RAt -the second obstacle Sam
Green made a mistake, dumping Evans
overboard. Taking the last hurdle St.
Anthony .fell and Alviso had a hard tum
ble. Both riders escaped I with -a few
trivial bruises. ... . ,1 Â¦ ... .

a trifle far for Â¦ hpr, Kitty Kelly appa

bunch of platers starting in the: opening
event. and. closed favorite.. She made all
the running,, but at the end was collared
and beaten easily by Plead, : an '8 ' to â¢ 1
shot, ridden by Hoar. Malaise was third.
The Naglee selling stake at six and -a
half furlongs resulted in a victory for
Constellator, a 12 to 1 shot, ridden by
Ransch, which beat Tower of Candles,
the second choice, a head. The latter
mare cut out the pace with her 93 pounds

on Headwater, which, coupled with Sweet

of 8 to 5. When the barrier v/as released

the winner. ! ' .Â¦ '. .
Constellator First by a Head.
A Certainty f or Waterscratch.
The race in question looked a two
horse affair, and of course, with The
Giver in a "dopey" state, it would have
been a certainty for Waterscratch. How
ever, it may develop that the three-year
old was only suffering from some ailment
common to the equine species.
Strangely enough," several years ago,
while the Bay District track was in
operation, Owner Boots had a horse
doped, which fact caused quite a sensa
tion at the time. Lucrezla Borgia, owned
by Elmwood farm, was matched against
Seraphim, backed by W. S. Hall, since de
ceased. The/ night preceding the race a
colored boy named "Cuba" gave the filly
an opiate of some kind. Danny Lynch
was accused of having a hand in the af
fair, and the case came up in the police
court, but a political pull was brought to
bear, fortunately for the offending per
sons, and the matter, was eventually
quashed. â¢ .
There were many surprises in store for
the big crowd yesterday; in, fact. Water
scratch alone upheld the reputation of
the favorites, and he *as held a prohibi
tive 1 to 5 chance. Plead, Finch, Thad
deus, Constellator and Duckoy were /ill
quoted at fancy odds. s
On Friday evening, when the employes
of the stable answered dinner call. The
Giver was playing, about in his stall ap
parently in the best of spirits. Otf their
return' one of, the men -opened the stall
and found the colt frothing at the mouth,
fVetful and nervous and with: no inclina
tion to nibble at his feed. Charles Boots
referred the case to the track officials
yesterday and Dr. Talbot examined the
colt. ' The veterinary said that while : the
symptoms indicated that some sort of a
decoction had been given the colt, his
condition was not dangerous. The mat
ter is under investigation. Dr. . 5"albot
said that by to-day he would probably be
able to determine positively whether or
not the animal's condition was superin
duced by a drug.
Later on it developed that Owner Boots
scratched The' Giver because her feared
the colt had been poisoned... From 'all', ac-r
counts there appears to be some founda
tion for his fears. " ' i . '

which Mrs. Catherine Enos executed on
her deathbed to Joseph Bernardo of West
Oakland. Public Administrator Hawes at
tempted to have the deeds set aside on
the ground that Bernardo obtained them
by fraud and undue influence, one of the
charges against him being that he se
cured an ascendency over the deceased
v.-oman by furnishing her with liquors.
The Public Administrator was induced to
take up the case through some neighbors
of Mrs. Enoa, who found that there was
nothing in the estate to pay claims which
they held against it for se rvlces rendered.
Bernardo's defense was that he had
taken care of Mrs. Enos a long time be
fore her death, furnishing her with food
and money when others refused to do so.
Judge Hall expressed the opinion that no
fraud had been practiced and that Mrs.
Enos was fully sensible when she made
the deeds.

Never heretofore in the history of Saa
Francisco have good dependable pianos
been sold for such little money. Never was
such a beautiful and large selection of
brand new instruments displayed on one
floor as during this sale. And never wera
people so quick to realize and take ad-
vantage of the benefits to be obtained by
patronizing: this sale and probably never
again will it be possible to obtain a first-
class, reliable new piano for such little
.money, r
With the exception of seventeen brand
new uprights and four or five second-hand
square pianos that we accepted during ths
past few days toward payment tor new

ment originally included in this sale has
been disposed of, and in order to make a
clean sweep of the whole matter and wiftd
up matters completely we will offer the
remaining instruments for sale Monday

former cut prices.

the fairest and greatest bona fide piano
sale ever witnessed in the West came to
a close last evening at the .wholesale
salesrooms of Kilers Piano Company,

dous stock of choice new pianos consist-
Ing of the New. Scale KimDall, Steinway.

during; the past two weeks. â¢ -
Exactly a hundred and eighty-three in-
struments Â¦ were disposed of during that
time, and we are pleased to present here-
with a partial list of the residents of San
Francisco- and vicinity who purchased
pianos of us during the sale. With one
exception there has not been a complaint
or - expression of dissatisfaction from a
single customer who has dealt with us,
and we are pleased to refer all who may
be interested as to the general satisfac-
tion given and the -high standard of ex-
cellence of the instruments, that were In-
cluded in this sale to each and every one

Electric power. is now transmitted from
the plant of the Keswick Electric Power
Company on Mill Seat Creek, near Shin
gletown, to the ' famous Iron Mountain
mine. The extension of the line to the
mine has just been completed. The power
is used for lighting of the smelters, but
will be applied to the working of the plant
as .soon as the proper machinery is in
stalled.' * ; ,
-The. Redding Searchlight says that the
old mining camp of the Mount- Shasta
mine will be revived. This is on Clear
Creek, near the town of Shasta.- The site
has been graded for a new mill and build
ings will -soon be erected and machinery
installed. Mr. Gabb is the superintendent.
The Butler group of mines having been
purchased by ' outside : capitalists, it is
given' out that water will be brought to
the property, , aV distance of forty-flve
miles, and that extensive explorations
will be put, on. foot. The ore sacked up
to date has been taken out by the leas
ers and has been hauled sixty miles 'to
the railroad, paying high transportation
and smelter, charges. \ Butler is the post
office address of the mines." In 'the 1 town
are now- about 1000 miners, with:" their
families, and a year, has seen the growth
from a population' of eighty to the pres
ent size. The. town of. Butler now boasts
of a bank, a newspaper, a school and a
church. Butler is in the desert atan al
titude of C000 feet above the Bea level,
Next to oil, and in fact, once holding
first place, is the mining of asphalt, il
limitable beds of- this valuable â¢ paving
product have been located here and
streets in many cities of America and
Europe are paved with Santa Barbara
asphalt. At the present time the output
is limited because of the restrictions of
the asphalt combine; but independent
companies are at work and the time is
not far off when the Santa Barbara ma
terial will again take first place In the
list of the available asphalt supplies.
During 1901 efforts were made to reopen
the quicksilver mines of the interior
ranges, but the product has not yet
reached the market. ' Development work
is progressing rapidly with success
assured. Gold has been gathered along
the beach at the mouths of some streams,
indicating its existence in the mountains,
but no discovery of importance has yet
been made. With many prospectors now
in the Santa Barbara Â¦ hills, the outlook
for the county as a. mineral producer is
very bright.
The Santa Barbara Morning Press says
of the mineral resources of Santa Bar
bara County:
The Erin Go Braugh and Clodman
quartz mines in Tuolumne County have
been deeded to the Harvard Gold Mining
Company. New York parties have taken
under bond, mining claims on the Doyle
ranch, west from Columbia. An agree
ment has been recorded by which W. C.
Price of Los Angeles will purchase the
Blue"bell and Turnback quartz mines. The
company operating the Feliciana mine on
the Tuolumne River has failed to make
payments and the property has reverted
to the owner. \ The Melones Gold Mining
Company has taken up four claims at
Robinsons Ferry. Sixty men are employed
at the App mine. The Gaguere mine at
Tuttleville is about to resume, according
to current report. The Peterson place on
Big Hill has been bonded by L. R. Peter
son to R. W. Yuill of Columbia.
Santa Barbara's Prospects.
P. C. Dubois, field assistant in the State
Mining Bureau, furnishes the following
general account of the operations in Fol
som that have resulted in the discovery
of rich gold-bearing gravel: Â¦'- ' â¢
"The new Gray-Wing drift mine is the
property in which the strike was made.
It is about four miles southeast of Fol
som and adjoins the old Blue Ravine drift
mine which has yielded richly in past
years. The region is a rolling one in the
very lowest of the foothills along the west
side of the Sacramento Valley. Through
this region an old river channel, belong
ing to recent time rather than to the
Tertiary system of dead rivers so promi
nent along the high slope, can be traced
for several miles. The gravel of the old
river bed lies deep and has been
mined more or less by drifting
along bedrock, but it has not, 1 been
extensively explored. Guided by the
past operations of the Blue Ravino
some Oakland people leased the adjoin
ing Plumb ranch of eighty acres and went
to prospecting the channel by the drift
method. A shaft reached bedrock at
sixty-nine feet, and after. some slight ex
plorations along bedrock the shaft was
sunk in the latter thirty-one feet, from
which point. a tunnel calculated to reach
the middle of the channel was run hori
zontally forty-five feet north. An in
clined upraise of twenty-five feet broke
into the gravel early In December. At
this point the bed of the channel was
found to display a low raise or hummock,
and behind this the richest gravel was
encountered.^ Another bedrock .tunnel
from the bottom of the shaft had been
run sixty-five feet south, and an inclined
raise to the west also broke into pay
gravel. It is reported that the richest
dirt encountered yielded from $140 to $160
to the pan. The workings of the Blue
Ravine and Gray-Wing Indicate a chan
nel width of 400 feet, with the rim not
reached on either side. Mining operations
are actively proceeding under the super
intendency of Pope Gray. The mine is
equipped with a steam hoist, the neces
sary buildings, washing: plant, etc., and
twenty men are employed. â¢ The gravel is
loose, free from large boulders and is
taken out to a height of six feet above
bedrock. The dirt is washed through
sluices in 'the ordinary way."
Work on the big ditch for the Sweep
stake mines in Trinity County has been
suspended for the season. The pipe lines
are reported to be complete from Weaver
Creek to the great reservoir and the water
will soon be turned on for a test. The
Redding Free Press says that the man
agers could .begin, hydraullcking at once
if they so desired. â¢
Folsom's Rich Gravel.
The Redding: Free ! Press says that the
Afterthought copper mine near old Fur
naceville is now owned by the Tarbet
Syndicate of Salt Lake City. The En
right smelter, on the same authority, has
also been bought by the Tarbets. The
mine was under a bond for $50,000. The
Free Press also says that the Old Span
ish mine in the Lower Springs district
will -be put in wor King- order. :
The Amador Record reports that the
Peerless mine in Jackson district has
closed down and the machinery has been
taken out. The new mill at the Key
stone mine will be running In February.
A very rich quartz prospect is reported
to have been found at the summit of
French Hill in the eastern suburbs of
Mokelumne Hill. The George Upton mine,
north of Plymouth, has been fitted up
with a ten-stamp mill, which was brought
from Quartz Mountain.
Several milling plants of the Coffee
Creek region of Trinity County have been
closed down oh account of the cold
weather. The cyanide plants have been
especially affected, the pipes freezing and
making it Impossible to work the ores.
The Golden Jubilee and the Nash mines
are among those that the frost has
stopped.- Several smaller plants In the
vicinity of Union Creek have been shut
down.
'From several mining' counties news
comes concerning active â¢ inquiry on the
part of outsiders for California' mining
properties. The Yreka Journal tells of a
syndicate of Oregon people concerned- In
bonding a large amount of mining ground
in the Callahans â¢ district in Siskiyou
County. A Pittsburg company is also re
ported to be securing much land along
the south fork of the Scott P.iver and is
using a large dredger to work the stream.
The Journal says i^ench capitalists have
arranged to g;aln mining lanu at the head
waters of Scott River, on Scott Moun
tain, at Jackson- Lake, Boulder Creek,
Wild Cat and other sections. : The Coroto
man mine In Sierra County, which has
been under bond to Southern California
parties, has been purchased fbr $15,000,
according to the' Grass Valley Union and
Herald.
The Salt Lake Tribune of the 1st inst.
contained a review of the mineral output
of Utah for the year 190L The statistical
part Is largely supplied by the returns of
Wells, Fargo & Co. .The total export
value of copper, unrefined lead, fine sil
ver and fine gold, is stated at $17,580,457 88.
The 'Tribune increases this total to $19,
402,431 67 by placing the silver and gold at
their mint value. This 'is placed by the
Tribune against the total valuation - of
$17,402,431 67, making an increase in 1901 of
$1,668,305 91. Of course the figures for 1901
were based on estimates. The Tribune
explains its figures as follows: *
"In arriving at the totals gold was com
puted at $20 67 ; an Â¦ ounce,, silver at 60%
cents an ounce, -copper at 15% cents a
pound and lead at 4 cents a poundâ each
an average at which the respective metals
ruled in 1901. In approximating the value
of the output of 1900 the values of gold
and lead corresponded with those of last
year. The argentiferous output of that
year, however, was computed at 62 cents
an ounce, .while that of copper was com-'
puted on a basis of 16 1-5 cents a pound â
not a small advantage when looked at in
the aggregate." Â¦ ' ,
A pamphlet has been Issued by George
L. Walker on the "Copper Mines of the
Southwest." In it occurs the following:
"Those who have kept a careful record
of the dividends paid by the reporting
metal mines credit the copper mines with
over 55 per cent of the whole. ' In other
words the copper mines of this country
apparently pay their owners larger gross
profits . than the gold, silver, nickel, zinc,
lead, tin, quicksilver, antimony, Iron and
all other metal mines combined. It is
only fair to say in this connection, how
ever, that a very large portion of the iron
is. mined by companies that are engaged
also in manufacturing and that the profit
made on the production of the raw iron
is In most cases credited to manufactur
ing and is not considered by those who
make up lists of metal mining dividends."
A company has been organized in Los
Angeles to develop the copper properties
In Jerome Canyon. There are eight
claims to be worked. . '
The Scott Valley Advance says:
"Miners are In .demand In all Northern
California at good wages. No idle man
need go through the mining districts If
he has any knowledge of handling a pick
and 'shovel. A number of B hands were
put to work in many of the properties all
over Siski you the past few weeks. The
cause of the scarcity is owing to the fact
that our county Is fast coming into prom
inence among mining promoters ana cap
italists who are investing 1 their money
within our surroundings, giving work to
many and opening many new mines." .
Total disbursments $1,214, 759 99, of which
1958,237 40 was paid in teachers' salaries. -The
total appropriation was $1,214,759 99, leaving a
surplus for 1001 of : $6860 01. Add s to this
$5911 10, balance brought forward January 1 1,
1901, and $5097 15, returned to the general fund
from the Children's Playground, makes a total
sum to the credit of the school fund of $17,
858 32.

An Interesting Parallel and a Valu-
able Deduction Therefrom.
Cutting down thistles no more relieves
the land of thistles than does scouring
the scalp cure dandruff.^ In each case
permanent relief can only come from
eradicating j permanently the cause. - A
germ that plows up the scalp in searching
for the hair root, where it saps the. vital-
ity, causes dandruff ,. falling ; hair and
baldness. If you kill that germ, you'll
have no. dandruff, but a luxuriant suit of
hair. Newbro's Herpicide is the only hair
preparation in the world that cures dan-
druff, falling hair and baldness by killing
the germ. "Destroy the cause, you re-
move the effect." .

.FIDELITY BCPTUBE CURE,
Such being the case, I shall use
every bonest endeavor to bring this
cure to tbe notice of the afflicted,
and hope that thereby many suffer-
ers will be enabled to benefit by
this one and only hope that ean lÂ»e
held out to the ruptured, for the
"FIDELITY" Cure does cure, and no
other treatment accomplishes tbe
desired effect. For this reason X
bestow unqualified praise upon the
"FIDELITY" System and advise
every victim of hernia to avail him-
self of the cure it offers beyond
'Question or doubt.
Dnrinar - the past eleven years . I
Have closely observed the projrreas
made by the "FIDELITY" , Cure, and i
Bcarcely a day has passed by that I
have not pursued investigation
through some one of the avenues of
information which open . to those
who seek truth and esteem facta
above all theories. As a. result I
have had before me case after case
wherein all other sources were ap-
pealed to in vain, but which yielded
to the potent power of the "FIDEL-
ITY" system, which brought perma- '
nent cure in every case coming to
my notlee. Ik the lijrht of such facts
I do not hesitate to declare that thin
system of treatment offers not only
the only hope, but also a positive
cure to every sufferer. >
The fact that our doctors do not
receive si cent until a cure is accom-
plished is sufficient evidence of'
their honesty and responsibility, as
well as their faith in the power it
possesses to permanently cure rup-
ture In 'whatsoever form it may!
occur. .
nut even the reliability of its
physicians or the financial reipon-
slhlllty of the company alone would 1
not entitle the "FIDELITY" Method;
to commendations, but I have gone'
further than this and demonstrated
by Indisputable evidence that thisj
treatment Is all that Is claimed, for!
last month X corresponded with sev-j
eral hundred patients who received
this treatment years ago, and their
reports were that it can be depend-,
ed upon as a cure sure and perma-;
nent beyond the slightest peradven-,
tore of a doubt. i
To the readers who may be rup-
tured We have . a -word of earnest
warning. Let not the vletim of;
hernia lay to his soul the flattering; j
unction that, because his rupture is
not as serious as some, he stands in!
no danger. >"o one, not even the
surgeon, can predict irhat a day.
may bring forth to the ruptured,
although, relatively, lie does not
appear to have as bad a case as;
others who are victims of this dread'
malady. *Â«-. . <
The ruptured man Is never safe|.
strangulation may occur without a
second's warning; he is always in
peril* always upon tbe brink of the!
volcano. A slight strain,* a fit of
Â«oughin*7, a sudden stepâ any off
these may be the cause -which accel-
erates Ms doom and brings to bint;
a fate worse than death, for the]
victim of strangulated hernia is;
practically beyond hope, the only;
recourse being a difficult and pain-
ful surarlcal operation, which train-
ed surgeons regard as being not
only the last resort, but, at the
â¢ante time, a dangerous expedient,
â¢which more frequently leads to
disaster than to success. This being
the cate> it is worse than folly to
pursue the suicidal course of refus-
ing the proffered aid of a thorough
and effective curative system such
as the "FIDELITY" Method alone
offers. It costs nothing to call and'
wave an examination made, and:
costs nothing for the treatment;
until a permanent cure has been;
accomplished. In the light of sneh
facts, It is the duty of every suf-
ferer to avail himself of this oppor-
tunity, or if he is not sufficiently
appreciative of it, his family physi-
cian should lend his entreaties to
effect the action, for every day and
Â¦Â«-%-cry hour the ruptured postpones
his cure Just that long he is in dan.

Â¦ Prof. â¢ Brockway Is â¢Â¦ a Â¦ past ' master among
eeers and stands among the gifted of earth's
" sons. â¢ â¢ . ; . Â¦ Â¦
;-: He twill: tell you your errand' without your
having : to explain It to', him, and .will point
out - the . manner In which you may . over-
come : your present troubles; and will point
outto you also the shoals and quicksands of
troubles to come, that you may avoid them.
IN THE MATTER OF LOVE AND
COURTSHIP HE STANDS 'WITHOUT, A
PEER.- . . - / ;. . . .Â¦--. Â¦ , ' Â¦ Â¦ ,. .. '
Prof. Brockway can reunite lovers If sep-
arated ' from any cause and bring about - a
. reconciliation among friends who . are ; . es-
tranged, from any cause.. He can restore the
. absent and : missing one. to r your : hearth-
stone, or he can tell how to charm and bring
â¢tO T you the one you 'love. Â¦ ' . _
_ If you are contemplating marriage. Prof.
Brockway will tell you whether your coming
union '.will: be for your best interests or not;
whether your wedded life is to be "ono
-grand, sweet song.", as Grover Cleveland
-Â¦aid: of 'his, or whether discord will be your
lot. Consult him, and he will tell you .wheth-
er you are about to draw a prize or a blank
â¢ In the lottery of ' marriage. Whatever of
, life s troubles may be spoiling your days and
nights, and mingling with . bitterness every

to quaff. Prof. Â¦ Brockway can rentove the
difficulties and smooth away the troubles
from your pathway; can put away the thorns

MINES AND BIINING.
ANOTHER Chance to Make Honest Money.
The Copper King Mining Syndicate has sixty-
five claims' In the Carbon River district, north
of and near Mount Rainier. The mines of the
district are rich, assays showing $16 to $200
In copper and gold. SO per cent of ,the values
being in copper. The company is negotiating
for coal lands, with excellent prospects of
securing a valuable tract. . Development work
is going briskly forward 'during the winter.
Machinery Is to be Installed early In the spring.
Engineer's report says: "The company plans
to make its mines productive the first year."
Prices will be substantially advanced after the
first Issue of shares is placed. At the price
they offer honest speculation, to say the least,
with the chances strongly in favor cf their
becoming, with early development of the dis-
trict, a profitable holding to the buyer who Is
! not. impatient for early, returns. Now is the
time to buy a block of these shares for a hand-
some profit, which they will most surely yield.
The largest sales of these shares have been
made the past week to - members of our ex-
cursion to the Montezuma mines last summer.
This significant fact should not escape the in-
vestor who would place his money wisely.
Â¦ "Watch for our next excursion to Washington.
j. Par value , of shares, $1; first issue being
i rapidly subscribed at Be cash or 6c on easy
Installments. Write now for preliminary pros-
pectus or neglect it and be sorry.

Loans were increased : $11,586,467, probably
representing joperations Incident to preparations
for .coupon . and interest payments. Deposits
were augmented $15,334,300, which amount
very nearly agrees with the total gain of loans
and of cash. .The surplus reserve was reduced
$375,775. This item now stands at $7,715,575
against $14,150,075 at this time last year. The
statement was doubtless made on rising "aver
ages for cash. The heaviest payments into the
banks by the treasury were in the early part
of the bank week, and the offsets resulting from
the above noted operations of this office were
distributed throughout the week.. The larger
banks were among the heaviest lenders of
money after the middle of the week, indicating
increased supplies of cash. Notwithstanding the
6ome.what unfavorable character of the banks'
exhibit as regards surplus, the condition of the
money market may be expected to grow more
normal during the current week. -â¢
â¢ NEW YORK. Jan. 4. â The statement of- the

shows: Loans, $869,546,600; increase, $11,586,

The Financier says: The movements of; cash
this week, so far as they affected bank condi
tions, are estimated to have resulted in a gain
to these institutions of $8,622,000. This in
crease was partly due to the heavy disburse
ments of $3,155,000 by the sub- treasury - for
unmatured bonds, which were bought early in
the bank week, and largely to a return 'move
ment of $7,250,000 net from j nearby interior
points, much- of which money was that which
had been withdrawn previous . to the holidays
for expenditure during the festive season.' and
was returned through the customary channels
of trade. The most important offset to the
gain last week was $2,528,700. which resulted
from the fiscal operations of the sub-treasury,
and also from the payments by ' New York
banks, for themselves and for their correspond
ents, of lawful money for the purpose of , re
tiring bank note circulation. " Gains . In cash
cf magnitude, it may be noted, are usual at
the beginning of Â¦ the year, not only f rpm in
ternal sources, but from the distribution of
dividends and Interest incident to this period.
Last year, for example, the bank statement of
January 5- showed a
gain in cash of $6,800,000, compared with the
last week in the previous year, and the increases
In cash were each week thereafter during Jan
uary â $11,900,000 January 12, $14),000,000 Janu
ary 19 and $7,400,000 January 26. Influences
now operating, however, may tend to make, the
weekly gain of cash by the banks less impor
tant than in the previous year, but that there
will continue to be more or less of an Increase
in cash seems highly probable. The bank state
ment falls to 'show the above estimated grain,
the increase in cash being only $3,457,800. This
discrepancy of more than $5,000,000 between the
estimated and the acual gain . cannot be ac
counted for except upon the supposition that it
resulted from the average system. . . .

the same week last year
practical consummation of the conversion of
Northern Pacific preferred stock intb common
Btock, which was an essential to the plan of
organization of the Northern Securities Com
pany, has been an -element of strength for
stocks. The adjustment of hostilities which
6eem to be still latent in the transcontinental
railroad â¢ situation was felt to be i dependent
on the success of this plan and Its progress
relieves anxiety caused by the evidences of
obstruction to > it. It - is hoped - also that the
way has been opened for a resumption of some
of the Important projects for further combin
ations which were interrupted by the shock of
the Northern Pacific corner last. May. The
lock-up of capital which resulted 1 from that
struggle of financial giants has been admitted
ly an ' element or embarrassment ever since.
Now that a prospect of release of part' of that
capital, speculators' are hoping- to see a re
newal of the stimulating effect of powerful
combinations of capital In the stock' market to
further the flotation of new securities which
maybe the product of new corporations. â¢ The
special strength of anthracite carriers during
the week is the reflection of the impression
that those properties are first on the list of the
plans for a merger. On the prospect for the
coming year in the stock market, opinion in
the financial world is by no means unanimous.
The present high level of prices is a subject of
eome misgiving, even among the bulls.. It Is
pointed out that not a few departments of the
market recovered after the May panic to higher
prices than before,- notwithstanding the excess
of speculation, which resulted in that upset to
the market. There are many stocks whose
prices were the highest on record at the end
of. the year. I The speculation which made those
prices was counting upon â¢ continued increase
In the earning power, rather than upon mere
maintenance of that power. The Amalgamated
Copper incident and the developments in that
trade are felt to be pregnant with suggestion
of possible results to flow from a decline in
demand for products of other industries, capi
talized on a basis of heavy consumption at
high prices. The course of the country's for
eign trade toward decreases - of manufactured
exports and .increase of imports is suggestive
of lessening demand and indicating competition
from the depressed foreign markets. The lack
of the financial . stimulus of enormous foreign
credits by reason of favorable trade balances
has already been. conspicuously evident. Signs
of revival In foreign financial and industrial
affairs raises the question of the relative at
traction for capital or a turning point froni
depression and a level far advanced toward
expansion. If not- Inflation. The balance be
tween these considerations and the apparent
purpose of prominent capitalists to embark on
further large enterprises which are dependent
for financial success upon large demand for
securities and a strong stock market give
promise of two parties in the speculative field
fn the future.
The bond market has been fairly active, but
somewhat irregular, an*' there has been no
striking investment demand for mortgage se
curities.

them, and had them arrested.

William Adams and John McFadden
appeared before Judge Cabanlss yester
day on a charge of burglary. They were
accused of breaking into the residence of
Charles Denlcke, teamster. 720 Railroad
avenue, December 20. They were arrested
by Policeman Buckley for discharging
firearms within the city limits; and while
being taken to the Potrero police station
one of them dropped a watch that had
been stolen from Denicke's house. That
was the only evidence against them and
the Judge dismissed the case.
Burglary Not Proved.
Practically every purchase made in 190J.
either was paying or could by building imme
diately have been made to pay a fair income.
Never in the history of the city have so many
manufacturing firms bought their own business
sites. In Investment properties buyers have
bought where bueinees was established.' even
though, in many cases, the location appeared
to be passe. For the best retail properties
top prices compared with past figures have
been paid, buyers preferring to pay premiums
for the best rather than a'ttempt to anticipate
where business might go. Real estate sales
were very greatly increased last year by own
ers of stocks and bouds selling them and in
vesting the money in city' business property/
In the seven years' dullness from 1831 to 180.$
nearly all large owners of money would not
touch real estate at all; nothing but stocks and
bonds were in favor then. But fluctuations in
B*nv of these securities - and heavy fail* m
Ar.fl to this increase should really be added
the price paid for the westerly halt of the
Blythe block, the negotiations for which took
place in July, 1901, although the deed will
not pass for several days yet. Xor is this all,
cither. Although our figures are for the .whole
of 1901, there were really only nine selling
months in It. During nearly a Quarter of the
year the labor strikes prevailed and nearly put
a stop to transfers for that length of time.
Buyers believed that If -the strikes were pro
longed prices would -weaken, and they held off
from purchasing for that reason. . Many of
them have not bought yet. A look backward
over the last ten - years shows that 1890 was
the banner year for heavy transactions, the
tales for that year amounting to S36.545.SS7.
The year 1898 was the poorest -year for sales.
The total value of the sales or that year was
only $10,747,102. It is interesting. Just now,
to study the ups and downs of real estate in
past years, because of the greater importance
now attached to San Francisco as a coming
commercial and manufacturing center. The
past year approaches -1S90 in . the monetary
value of sales made, but it does not - compare
with 1890 in the number of transactions. In
18dO there were 6CS0 tales made, and in 1901
'there were but 4261 sales. The reason why
the number of sales was so much smaller for
the past year was because there has been 'no
outside land speculations and no general pur
chasing except for use on the part of small
buyers. The amount of money Involved in the
transactions of the past year was very large
in proportion to the number of sales made, be
cause the great majority of sales were of valu
able business properti*s. . The Southern. Pacific
and Santa Fe Railroad companies wer* large
buyers last year. The Blythe block, too, was
the largest single Kale ever made in San Fran
cisco. The most notable feature of 1901 was
the absolute absence of speculation.
1901 far surpassed the entire
year of 1900 In the sales of realty in this
city. Since then the complete figures f or
the full year have been received. From
these it appears that the increase was $10,-
C20.155 over 1900. and that the sales out
numbered those of 1900 by 1002. The total
sales for 1931 were $23,147,969. In 1900 the
total was $18,527,814; in 1899 the total was
$14,555,137; in 1E98 the record made was
$10,747,102. These summaries are made ud
by Thomas Magee & Sons in their Reai
Estate Circular. Concerning the sales of
1901 the Circular says:
THE fignres published In The Call
last Sunday in connection with
the weekly real estate review
showed that eleven months of
Henry. Kahn- has resold to the Sperry
Flour Company property bought by him
seme time ago from, the estate of Charles
8. Johnson, on the northeast line of Spear
street, 183:4 feet southeast from Mission
street, getting an advance from the price
Deeds have been recorded, completing
the transfer to the.Rlsdon Iron. and Lo
comotive Works from the Pacific Rolling
Mills of property at the Potrero, an old
transaction, for $550,000; also' transferring
the old Pacific Stock Exchange property
on Montgomery and Leidesdorff streets
from George , W. McNear to the * Mer
chants' Exchange. for $150,000. '
Leon Carrau has sold . ;to Walter A.
Green the southeast corner, of Geary and
Buchanan streets for $40,000.
.The estate of Annie M.;McCormick has
sold to Lipman C. Coleman 137:6x25 feet on
the north line of Turk street. 181:3 feet
west from Larkln, for $9700.
The Barikers' Investment Company is
about to complete the purchase of the
Blythe Droperty, in the center of the city,
by taking in the western portion, facing
on Market street,' Grant avenue, O'Farrell
and Geary streets. For this portion the
sum to be paid is $1,205,000. This makes
the total for the whole, including the
Blythe properties acquired previously by
the company, $2,255,000. This deal was ef
fected by Thomas Magee & Sons. %
The Nobman estate has sold, the south
west corner of California and Fillmore
streets for $42500. The lot is 87:6 feet on
Fillrnore street and 78 feet on California
street. ..â¢ ,
Large realty deals are still the order of
the day. During the last week the block
bounded by Bay, North Point, Powell and
Mason streets has been sold for $140,000.
This is the site of the wire works. Tha
block was sold by the heirs of the late A.
S. Hallidie and others. The block is 412 :6x
275 feet. .
The coming year promises to be a good year
in real estate. While business is now good, it
really . should be far better. The year 1001
closed on a steady, conservative market that
has been absolutely void of speculation. Buy
ers -will only buy inside paying properties. For
three years past the only business properties
that have advanced. have been in the retail and
wholesale sections or along the outer edge of
the retail - section. We now believe Â¦ that all
property will soon increase in every section of
the city. - It will not come as a surprise if the
total sales of 1002 reach forty millions. With
an ample rainfall these figures may be ex
ceeded. There has not -been as interesting and
instructive and more solid year in real estate,
without any excitement, than the year Â¦ 1901.
There have been three periods in . the history
of the city in which the sales were much
larger than in 1901. but -these periods
were characterized by reckless inflation and by
buyers paying only 25 to 30 per cent cash, go
ing into debt in a wholesale and headlong fash-
Ion- with the final results -of terrible depres
sions, many foreclosures and I long periods of
fall In prices. Â¦Â¦â¢-â¢.' '

forecast for the year 1902:

others gave holders of them severe' cramps of
disappointment and caused great numbers to
take their money out of these securities and
ro back to their first but long despised lave,
