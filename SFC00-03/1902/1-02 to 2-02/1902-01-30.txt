having neglected his duties and. in the
company of several of â¢ his deputies ' fre
quented the . racetrack, to the neglect of
the business of the city. .
Mayor [ Schmltz placed Cyril Williams,
the city's expert, at work on Williams*
books,^ and the following' day Harry F.
Morris, a trusted employe of the Rauer
Collection Company, confessed- to having
withheld $124 in fees, j which he* had
marked paid upon the books of. the de
posed clerk. Morris made a tender of
this amount to the Mayor and it was later
conditionally accepted and is now in the
Mayor's safe.
While the expert was examining the
books Williams surrendered to Powel
Fredrick, whom tho Mayor appointed as
his successor, the keys and combination
of the safe. An examination of the con
tents of the safe showed that there was
$530 therein, which . Williams . said was
made up of fees due upon cases on ap
peal to the Superior Court. The charge
for an appeal is ?7, of which $6 is sent to
the County Clerk when the cases, "go
up," and $1 is retained as fees for the
support of the "Justices' ' Courts and is
later deposited in the city treasury.
"Williams made no objection to turning
over to me the combination of the safe
or the keys to the cashbox," said Acting
Clerk Fredrick yesterday. "1 deposited
the money in : the city treasury as a spe
cial deposit.' In some of 'these cases time
for appeal is limited to five days and in
others to thirty days. Williams said that
Included in the $530 was some money put
up as bonds. Personally I do not know
of any defalcation." \
Trifling "Errors in Books.
Expert Cyril Williams concluded his ex

night and will make his report to the
Mayor to-day. He said: â¢
With the money -found in the safe, and the
$124 turned in by Morris, Williams', books bal

"The consolidation of the Northern Pa

'.'It is my bounden duty to prevent if
possible the consolidation referred to, be

also ; the â¢Â¦ settled policy of this State is
against the consolidation of parallel and
competing railroad lines. Competition in
the matter) of rates always has been and
ever will be beneficial to the people, I and
no specious argument or statement â¢ from
those desiring to do away with such com
petition is. sufficient to meet plain' facts

"However, 'the question whether .the

At another point Dr. Wiley said it was
a, question whether, the relief sought for
Cuba would have the effect of killing out
right the cane and Â¦ beet : sugar \ Industry
of this country, or merely paralyzing
them, rendering the patient a burden to
his " friends." But it seemed perfectly cer
tain, he said, that there would be no'fur
ther factories and Investments In this line
in this country. : Probably there would be
feeble efforts to save things from the
wreck, but Dr. Wiley, said there would no
longer Â¦ be. the .work of a young giant of
protection.' ." â¢ â¢ - .=.-â¢:,..
Â¦ . ' Â¦ ' -
The cause of the trouble they - are flghtinc
is not In the tariff duties of thÂ« United States
but la the over-production of sugar, due to
bounties granted by Europe. Their cause
should be pleaded in the parliaments of Europe
not in that of America. Â¦- Their suits shonld
go before the Relehstag. the Bundearath and
the Corps LeglslaUf. and not before- the Amer
ican Congress. ThÂ« place to plead their cause
is before the Congress of Brussels, not befora
tne\Ways and Means Committee of the Con
gress of the United , States.
. Dr. Wiley expressed the opinion, how
ever, that the beet sugar would never ex
tinguish the cane product, as the latter
bad certain special uses. Dr. Wiley's em
phatic declaration that Cuba's appeal to
the United States was misplaced and
would not afTord - relief attracted much
attention. This came- after he had shown
that the European bounty and."kartel"
systems were the controlling factors In
tne sugar situation. The Cuban planters
had .prospered, he said, under - the . Span
ish regime; and why, should they now lay
their, misfortune to the breaking -of the
Spanish yoke? Under such circumstances
it mieht be best -to lead them , back to
Spain. Dr. Wiley then said:.
Dr. H. W. -Wiley., chief of the Bureau
of Chemistry, Department of Agriculture,
was before the Ways and. Means Com
mittee to-day. in connection' with the Cu
ban reciprocity question. His statement
covered the scientific, phases of the pro
duction of sugar from beets, cane, etc.,
and the development of the respective in
dustries. By means of charts he showed
the comparative insignificance of, the beet
sugar industry in 1855. when most of the
sugar was made from cane. Since then
conditions have â¢ reversed, until now the
greater part of the sugar production Is

WASHINGTON, Jan. 29.-The Republi
can ' members of ,thÂ© Ways â¢ and â¢Â¦ Means
Committee held a private conference to
night and decided to frame a bill for the
reduction of war revenue taxes before
proceeding further with the subject of
Cuban reciprocity.
Chairman Payne at once called a meet
ing of the. full committee for, to-morrow
morning, when work on the war revenue
reduction bill will begin. No draft of a
bill has been prepared by. the Republican
members, but it ; is pretty fully under
stood that the majority is prepared to fa
vor Â¦ a measure effecting very - large re
ductions, amounting practically to a re
peal of the . entire' war, taxes and aggre
gating about $68,000,000.
The restriction of recent hearings to
beer and tea led to the belief that reduc
tions might be confined to these two arti
cles, but the sentiment of the majority
now appears to be favorable to a. much
larger, reduction." At .the conference to
day it was the prevailing view that* as
Cuba has been the cause for incurring
the war revenue taxes the burden should
be removed from this country before con
sidering the extent of relief to be granted
to Cuba. The question of what percent
age of reduction in tariff rates would be
made for Cuba was not considered at the
meeting to-night owing to the determi
nation to leave this until after the war
revenue ' reductions â¢ had [ been accom
plished. - . ,.
"Atcan early hour this morning It was
announced; it was said, on the authority
ol 'â¢ the I Justices of the Peace, that at a
meeting, of the Justices held last night,
all being with the exception of
Justice Groezinger, Â¦ who is â¢ still ill; that
Edward Williams had been removed from
his position and that Joseph A. : Windrow
had been selected to fill the vacancy.
Â¦.The Justices of the, Peace were not
aware at the time the removal of Wil
liams was made that he had tendered his
resignation to >. the Mayor. -;Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦ â¢. .,
â¢ "We removed 'Williams," said Justice of
the Peace Daniels; "because he, was lax in
his ; duties ah did not properly attend to
them. Windrow is a Deputy* Sheriff
and has been acting as bailiff In-Jurlee
Coffey's and Judge Cook's courts. He was
at one time in charge of one of the Branch
County Jails. -
The section of the charter relating to
the selection of a clerk for the Justices'
Courts is contained in article -V, chapter
7, section 1, and reads as follows:, -; v
Section 1 â The Justices of Â¦" the Peace shall
each receive an annual salary of $2400, except,
the presiding Justice, who shall receive $2700.
They shall appoint a chief clerk, who shall hold '
office for two years, and receive an r annual
salary of $2400. The chief clerk may appoint
five ' deputies, each of whom shall receive an
annual salary of $1200.',- ; ,
An interesting question arises now as
to whom is delegated the * power to ' ap
point a successor to Clerk Williams. The
latter C was elected at the beginning of
ihe year* for two years by the unanimous
vote of the present members of the Jus
tices'. Courts. As the report of the expert
Indicates his books are clear, /conse
quently, there is no apparent: reason why
they; might not again. select him for that
office.-' : ;-.:â¢. : v Â¦ Â¦ l * "r, '.,- Â¦ .
I do .iot, of course, know what actuated! Mr.
Williams in thus . summarily ending the pro
ceedings, but I am satisfied with the results.
Williams has not been : around the
office lately occupied by him for the- last
two days and rumors -were current that
he had left the city. Inquiry at Williams'
home resulted in the re$ly that all day
yesterday he was in consultation with hi\Â»
brother-in-law, former District Attorney
Snook of Alameda County, and would be
at home at a late hour. -
.The expert has reported that the books of the
office which he has' examined, disclose only
clerical irregularities, except as to the Rauer-
Morris transactions.
-I have never had any doubt, nor have I now,
of my right to Euspend Mr. Williams during an
investigation and to appoint" a temporary ofn
clalin his place, nor of my right to remove
him upon proof of the acts charged agalri6t
him. g Mr. Fredrick' ls now . discharging - the
functions of his office ; and' every ..act is* of
course a legal act. I shall therefore allow mat
ters to : remain in abeyance for , a few days.
It 'Is possible that I may see fit not to acct.
this . resignation and still to exercise my pre
rogative of removing Mr.' Williams on "- the
charges now pending, namely,, of neglecting
the 1 duties of his office and absenting himself
therefrom. ':.--â¢ ,Â¦ <- . â¢â¢' Â¦ .' -

NO CENSORSHIP,

WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan. 29.â For an
hour to-day the Senate had under discus-'
sion whether jn censorship of press dis
patches exists In Manila. While no such
turbulent scenes as those of yesterday
.were enacted, tho debate for a time was
very spirited.
The Secretary of "War was quoted as
saying that no press censorship now ex
isted in the Philippines and a letter from
General Greely, chief signal â¢ officer of the
army, was presented by Beveiidge of In
diana, making the statement official, that
there was ; no censorship of â¢ ' press dis
patches and that "the press ts entirely
free.'! ,
It Was contended by the opposition that
a press censorship did exist in the Phil
ippines and that copies of every news
dispatch filed with the cable company
was filed with the military authorities.
That, 1 it was maintained, constituted a
virtual censorship. S3QiKKati9

at the residence of the groom 1 , 1940 Web

clergyman will be Rev. E. A. Woods, pas-
the history of the county. Waterpipes
were frozen and sheets ot ice formed on
shallow pools. The damage to young
fruit trees has not yet been announced,
but it is feared that it will be consid
erable as little smudging has been done.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 29.â The morn
ings remain clear and cold in this city,
while a change is noticeable during the
afternoons, the weather warming up con
siderably. This morning there was more
frost on the ground than for the past fe*v
days The recent rains and snowstorms
in the adjoining mountain sections have
been of benefit, green feed having started.

STOCKTON, Jan. 29.â All the good done
by recent rains to the grain is being
rapidly undone by a cold north wind that
has been blowing over this part -of the
county since early this morning. Though
the sky was clear and the sun was out
to-day ice remained in gutters and small
puddles. Farmers predict that rain will
follow the windstorm.
WILLIAMS " QUITS HIS POSITION,
The bride-to-be is a charming young
woman and daughter, of C E. Welby, a
well-known cattle man, formerly a-resi
dent of this city but now living in Merced
County. She is of a literary ,_ turn of mind,
as her connection with the local Baptist
publication testifies. The groom was con
nected with the locai press for many
years, and since his connection with the
organ of the retail grocers has doneihuch
to perfect the organization of ; the grocers,
not only in San Francisco, but through
out the State. . ,. , .'*
The groom is a native son and a gradu
ate of the State University, class of '89.
He is a son of A. H. Powers, a pioneer
vineyardist of Fresno County, where he
took a prominent part in organizing the
raisin combine. He is at the present time
president of the Producers' Raisin Pack-,
ing Company. A brother of the groom is

The wedding will be private, only the
relatives and immediate friends of â¢ the
contracting couple having been invited to
attend. W. J. S. Powers will.be grooms

GRASS VALLEY, Jan. 29.â A cold snap
ttruck this city several days ago. On Sun
day morning the mercury dropped to 14,
on Monday it touched 19 and yesterday It
fell to 13 above. The ground has been
frozen solid all the week, gutters are cov
ered with Ice and water pipes are freezing
and bursting. To prevent the general
bursting of pipes many hydrants hava
been left running all night, entailing a
great waste of water. Owing to the low
ness, of the water In the city reservoir
system the City Trustees met this after
noon and decided to shut down the head
gate, cutting off a third of the supply.
Action was taken to prevent the turning
open of hydrants at night. If the freeze
continue the city officials will wrap all the
fire hydrants in straw and burlap to keep
them ready for use.
SANTA ROSA, Jan. 29.â Heavy frosts
have accompanied the cold wave.' but no
reports of damage to fruit have come in.
Orchardists say this weather is Just what
Sonoma County wants for a month yet, as
it will keep the fruit buds back and pre.
vent their being nipped by late frosts. The
grain ls not yet up far enough to be dam
aged by the frost.
SAN JOSE, Jan 29.-A fierce north wind
raged here from midnight until daylight
this morning. At times the rate was more
than forty miles an hour. The streets
were swept clean, display signs were torn
down and early blossoms of the almond
trees were stripped from the branches.

SACRAMENTO. Jan. 29.â Although the
weather ls biting cold and Weather.Ob
server Ecarr predicts another frost for
to-morrow morning, there are no com
plaints from either the agriculturists or
the horticulturists of this section. The
ground has had considerable moisture
and plowing and seeding have been in no
way retarded.- As to the fruit-growers,
they are delighted that the frost has
Come, since lt gives promise of harder
fruit and less rigorous frosts later.
George B. Katzenstein, manager of the
Earl Fruit Company and one of the best
posted fruit men in the State, said to
night that he had Just returned from a
trip through the fruit-growing sections
of the country and had received reports
from localities beyond the county line.
"The present frosts," said Katzenstein,
"are really beneficial to deciduous fruits.
A year ago at this period we had a warm
spell that forced the trees to blossom. As
a consequence, when the heavy frosts of
March came, they did much damage to
the trees, 'ihe present frosts have a ten
dency to keep back the blossoms and re
tain the sap in the body of the trees.
After the frosty spell has passed the buds
will have a chance, and, since it is a
rule that when the early frosts are se
vere the later ones are mild, the trees
will suffer but little. In Northern Cali
fornia our oranges ripen so early that we
have them all marketed by January, so
you see there Is nothing to complain of
on the part of the citrus fruit grower."

the outskirts of the town. In Redlands
several inches of snow is reported. The
mountains clear down to the foothills are

in this city a cold, severe north wind
came up, continuing several hours, doing
some damage to fruit trees farther down
the valley. The mercury is low and the
barometer is going down and a cold storm
ls indicated.
So far the damage to fruit is trivial.

LOS ANGELES. Jan. 22.â Tropical
plants In various parts of Scruthern Cali
fornia were treated to a downfall of elcet,

paid no attention and blossomed as
brightly as ever as soon as the sun came
out. On the books of the local weather
bureau lt is reported that "sleet, snow,
rain and hail began at 6:47 and ended at
S:20 a. m. Sleet fell from 7:30 for about
twelve minutes, slowly changing to snow
and then to rain." The combination of
snow and rain that fell coated the ground
with white, but melted almost immediate
ly in the center of town. In the outskirts
it lasted a few minutes, much to the de
light of children. Colton, Hedlands, San
Bernardino and the Cahuenga Valley, as
well as Los Angeles, were surprised by
a light fa!! of snow and hail. At Prospect
Park nearly an inch of hall was gazed
upon with wonder. Snow came down the
Cahuenga Pass in clouds and coated the
footnills with white.

WASHINGTON^ Jan. 29.â An adjourned
meeting of the', trustees' of the' Carnegie
Institution was; held at the State Depart
ment this afternoon and a step was taken
towards permanent organization and the
initiation. of the work of the institution.
Abram S. Hewitt of New York called
the' meeting, to order, and Secretary Hay
was elected temporary .chairman and
Charles D. Walcott temporary secretary.
W. E. Dodge of New. York was elected to
the board to : nil * the .vacancy caused by
the declination of ex-President Cleveland,
who sent a letter i regretting. his. inability
to serve. "After /the roll call Andrew Car
negie made a brief address," presenting the
deed of gift. He said: â
1 beg, to thank you deeply for so promptly,
so cordially, t aiding me by acceptance of the
trusteeship." A note from the President con
gratulates 'me upon "the high character, in
deed,. I may say, the extraordinarily high char
acter * of tile trustees" â such are ' his words.
I believe this- estimate has been- generally ap
proved throughout the wide ; boundary of the
United States. , . Â¦->,-â¢.Â¦ .'- : . * ;, Â«1
My first thought was. to fulfill the expressed
wish of, Washington by establishing a-.univer
sity here. but.a;stu'dy of the. question forced
me to the decisloB'that under the present con
ditions, were. Washington still with us, his
finely balanced judgment would decide that,
in our generation at least, such use of wealth
would not be - tne-:best. One of the moat seri
ous objections,, and one that I could not over
come,' was that another university might tend
to weakens existing universities. My desire
was to co-operate, with all educational institu
tions, and establish', what would be a source of
strength and not of .weakness to them, and the
idea of a Washington University or anything of
a memorial character was therefore abandoned.
Washington's Name Reserved.
It cost some effort", to . push aside the tempt
ing idea of a Washington University founded
by Andrew Carnegie, which the president of
the Women's George Washington Memorial
Association was kind enough to suggest. That
may* be reserved for another in the future, for
the realization of .Washington's desire would
perhaps justify the linking of another name
with his, but certainly notning else would.
This gift, or the donor has no pretensions to
such honor and in no wise Interferes with the
proposed university, or with any memorial. .' It
has its own modest field, and ls intended to co
operate with all kindred institutions, including
the . Washington University, If ever built, and
it may be built If we continue to increase in
population as heretofore for a generation. In
this hope, I think the name should be sa
credly held in reserve. It is not a matter of
one million' or ten 'millions, or even 'twenty
millions, but of more, to fulfill worthily, the
wish of Washington, and I think no one would
presume to use that almost sacred name except
for a university of the very first rank, estab
lished by national authority, but as . he de
sired. Be lt our part, in our day and genera
tion, to do what we can to .extend the bound
aries of human knowledge Â¦ by utilizing exist
ing Institutions. ......
Gentlemen, your work begins, your alms are
high, you ! seek to extend known forces, and to
discover and utilize new forces for the bene
fit of man. Than thU there can scarcely be
greater work. . I wish you abundant succesa,
and venture to prophesy that .through your
efforts, . In co-operation with those of kindred
societies In our country, contributions to the
advancement of the race through research will
compare In the near future not unfavorably
with those of any other land. Again I thank
you.
Words of the Deed.
The' deed itself recites in substance as
follows: -
That Andrew ! Carnegie deems it his duty
and his highest privilege to administer the
wealth which has come to him as a trustee In
behalf ' of others, and entertainlne the belief
that the best means of discharging that trust
is by extending the opportunities for study and
research In our country, ha transfers to the
trustees named ten millions of registered five
per cent bonds of the United States Steel Cor
poration. This tiff 1b' to be held in trust, the
income from bonds or from other securities
that, may -be substituted for them to be ap
plied to paying. the expenses of the trustees,
who are to receive the bonds and collect ' the
interest and may sell the same and Invest the
proceeds according to the laws of New York,
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, and who are
not made Â¦ responsible for ithe safety' of the
bonds or for their depreciation, i ' . Â¦
They may apDoint officers, fixing their, sal
aries and provide, for the financial business of
the.trunt. The income Is jto be exnended for
founding; in Washington an institution to co
operate t with those - now or hereafter, ; estab
lished, and in the broadest and most liberal
manner encourage . investigation, research and
dlscGvery, ehow the application of knowledge
to the improvement of mankind, provide such
buildings, laboratories, books , and apparatus
as may be needed and afford Instruction of an
advanced character to students properly quali
fied to profit, thereby. Unexpended income may
be, kept in a reserve fund to defray. the cost of
buildings. By a two-thirds vote the trustees
may modify these conditions in connection
with the original purpose, Â¦ which is "to secure,
if possible, for the United States , of- America
leadership in - the domain -of inquiry and the
utilization ! of new forces for ths . benefit of
mankinds - :. !â¢; ' :Â¦ : ' ;\i Â¦
After accepting Â¦ the deed of gift the
trustees proceeded to adopt by-laws and
elected the following officers: Chair
man of the board Â¦ of trustees, Abram S.
Hewitt; vice chairman; Dr. C. H. Billings;
secretary, Charles D. Walcott. *Dr. J. C.

Carpenter was then questioned as to
the trial held on May 27 in Trowbridge's
Hall, Judge Myers presiding. He said
that Richard Nichols was engaged that
day in watching Mary Wilson on the
streets to see that she was not given fire
arms by* Indians for the. use of the pris*
oners. This last statement caused a mur
mur to go around the courtroom. -
A slight storm was raised when Raker
asked Carpenter if John Hutton was not
in the habit of playing with children
The question was objected to and Spencer
said the defense wanted to show the men
tal caliber of the man. Sturtevant, for
the prosecution, said he did not believe
that because a man played with children
he was an idiot. Raker started to make
an argument and Post objected.

said that he was awakened on the morn

cries did not startle him. He heard some
body say that something was the mat

Raker resumed the examination of the
witness.
Carpenter was on the witness stand the
rest of the afternoon. He said that "Jim"
Brown and Judge Myers were out on the
porch when he passed through the parlor
to the sidewalk. He had testified during
the morning session that they followed
him into the parlor, but the discrepancy
was not explained.
Carpenter said he called to the mob to

a torrid one. During the examination of

permission of the court to recall Super
visor Kane to the stand 'to answer
a ; few more ' Questions, as . Kane desired
to return home. Counsel l for the defense
made no objection, but when Kane was
recalled Raker objected. to many of the
questions. Spencer remarked that any
thing was permissible for the prosecution
-but that when the prosecution objected to
questions by the defense It 1 was always
sustained. Â¦ â¢ ,%

Carpenter said he went downstairs and
was confronted by weapons in the hands
of masked men. J. R. Myers, Goyette and
James W. Brown also were held up at
the point of revolvers. Myers protested
against such an outrage in his house and
the witness also complained. The witness
went behind the bar and saw the masked
men taking the prisoners out of the room.
The lynchers threatened to hang the
guards if they did not cease protesting.'.
Later Carpenter testified that Brown
and Goyette were taken by the lynchers.
He said that he went into the parlor and
saw the masked men in the street through
the open door, but he did see any one in
the parlor or going through the door.
Calvin: Hall slept in the parlor. The wit
ness sdld that Myers and Brown followed
him into the parlor, but did not explain
how Brown had followed him into the
parlor when, as he previously said. Brown
had been taken out by the lynchers.
Carpenter said that he and "William
Nichols guarded the prisoners In the bar
room, of the hotel until about 1 o'clock
on the morning of the lynching, when
they were relieved by Sidney Goyette and
James W. Brown, the defendant. The
witness went upstairs to bed and fell
asleep. He was awakened by a noise and
rushed downstairs In nis night clothes. '
Yesterday, on the stand, Mrs. Myers
Carpenter's mqther-in-law, testified that
she awoke Carpenter and that he was so
sound asleep that she had to shake him
twice.
The court â I -will not dispute your word in

weeks, Mr. Harrii. :
Rakerâ Mr. Bonner can take care of himself.
The courtâ He la not capable of taking care
of himself. He has been under the tutelage of
Raker and Harris for six or seven months.
Raker â It Is not a fact. The statement Is
untrue and the court knows it.
The court â I will make any statements in

Harris â I have never had any conversation

Erving Carpenter, Constable of Look
out Township, was the most important
witness on the stand this morning. Raker
offered Carpenter's testimony before the
Coroner's Jury as evidence in the case, but
it was not allowed. Some delay occurred
before the examination of Carpenter was
taken up and the court urged the gentle
men of the defense to hasten, as time was
valuable. *
Court's Opinion of Bonner.
i Fred Caspar, a farmer, testified that ho
was in Lookout on May 27 last and had
some work done at Leventon Bros.' black
smith shop. He attended the examination
of the Halls, Daniel Yantis and young
Martin Wilson in Judge Myers' court.
While in the courtroom he heard no one
speak of lynching the prisoners. He said
that he did not see B. S. Trowbridge,
Richard Nichols, Mary Hall or Isom
Eades In the courtroom, contradicting the
testimony of Lafe Harris, who said, these
persons were there and that some of those
present hinted that hanging' would be a
fitting punishment for the prisoners. He
spent most of the afternoon around town
and in Leventon's blacksmith shop. Â¦ -
One or two rows occurred durinsrT the
examination of Caspar, Kaker attempt
ing to introduce testimony which the
court deemed immaterial and ruled out.
The witness gave the defendant and his
alleged accomplices a good character.
The defense placed three withesses on
the stand this morning. Supervisor Den
nis B. Kane of the i^ifth Supervisorial
District of Modoc County testified that he
stopped at Myers' hotel the night of May
30. His testimony was not important on
its face, save that it substantiated in gen
eral the stories told on the stand by Mrs.
Ollie Gibbons and Mrs. J. R. Myers, her
mother. The witness said that ne heard
no conversation in the hall and that when
he was first awakened by the noise of the
mob in the barroom he believed the build

Supervisor Kane Testifies.
During one of the ' customary clashes
with counsel for the defense this morn
ing, Judge Harrington declared that the
District Attorney was under the tutelage
of the lynchers' attorneys. He intimated
that the latter were in some way respon
sible for the failure of. the District At
torney to do his duty and declared in un
equivocal terms that Bonner was In their,
control." Judge Harrington was extreme
ly angry and spoke to the point. Judge
Harris, who took exception to his re
marks, was told to dispute them out of
court, when the Judge would be ready
to back up anything that he said.
â¢ ALiTURAS, Jan. 29.â Judgre Harrington
wfent on the warpath this morning during
the trial of "Jim" Brown, the alleged
lyncher, and before he had finished "giv
ing his mind" the court's opinion of Dis
trict Attorney Bonner had been expressed
without reservation. Bonner :â¢ has from
the start been regarded as a friend of the
alleged participants in the hanging of the
Halls, Daniel Yantis and Martin Wilson,
and the prosecution of the suspects has
devolved upon the State. The District
Attorney protested to the Grand Jury
against returning the later indictments,
arguing that there was no likelihood of a
conviction and the county would be heed
lessly bankrupted. â¢ :

George, who is one of the best known
fishermen on the bay, insists that the im
mense fish was a striped bass.
After he had gone a short distance the
fish revived and in its desperate efforts to
free itself the boat was overturned and its
occupant thrown into the water. Charles
Allison, the agent at San Quentin, saw
the fisherman's peril and procuring a boat
went to the rescue. George and Allison
made every effort to right the former's
boat or tow it ashore, but owing to the
current they failed and at last were com
pelled to cut the floundering nsh loose in
order to save the boat and nets.
George dragged his net for bass near
San Quentin Point this morning. When
he commenced to haul his catch aboard
his heavy salmon boat he found that he
had captured a giant bass. For mare
than an hour he clubbed and gaffed the
monster and at last succeeded in getting: a
g rope through its gills. He then started to
~low his catch to the wharf.
SAN RAFAEL* Jan. 29.â John George, a
fisherman of Point San Quentin, was
given a battle for his life to~day by a
giant fish, whlQh he declares Traa a striped
bass. The fish overturned his boat and
Georgre would have been drowned had not
help arrived.

to the doctor," writes Mrs. James R. Moss, New

cine, which helped me for a short time. In the
winter of 1895 I got worse than I had ever been.
My tonsils were enlarged and my neck swollen
all out of shape; my throat was sore and I could
not cure it My husband went for the doctor,
but he gave me no encouragement. He helped
me a lime, but it did not last long 1 . He attended
me for twelve months, whep I heard of a ladv
whose condition was like mine, who was taking
your medicine end was getting well. So I se-
cured some of the medicine and began taking- it
In one week I was able to do my cooldny. When
I began taking the medicine I* could sit up only
a few .minutes at a time, and I could rest or sleep
only a little while at a time. My throat was so
sore at times I couJd not even swallow sweet
Tniilr, and my tonsils were full of little eating
sores. My left side was swollen out of shape
and I could hardly get my breath. The doctor
said I would not get well, but three bottles of
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery, three
bottles of his ' Pellets.' three bottles of Dr. Sage's
Catarrh Remedy and the use of salt water did
the work and cured me." 0 : -,"

Joseph BlackwelJ, a . quartermaster on
the army transport "Warren, was acci
dentally drowned yesterday morning:. The
Intensity of the storm- rendered it advisa
ble to remove the transport's boats and
launches from, the boom to the vessel's
stern. Blackwell, in one of the lifeboats,
assisted in making the transfer and then
tried to board the "Warren by climbing
hand over, hand up the painter that held
the lifeboat to the steamship. . He was
advised to wait" until a bowline could be
passed to him. He: scorned this" aid to
transportation, however, but found it
impossible to get aboard by the 'painter.
In his efforts to do bo he became ex
hausted and before assistance could reach,
him loosened his hold, fell into the water
and disappeared. * Blackwell was about 2$
year%of age, single and .a native of Lan
cashire, He was formerly on the Pomona
and joined the Warren only a week ago.

Amador Almost -, in Collision.
Nothing but the prompt action yester
day morning of thd captains of the ferry
boat Amador and ; the river steamer Al
visq avoided what would, have been a seri
ous' collision. The Amador, v on - her 1
o'clock trip from ' Sausalito, was passing
'the foot .'of Clay street when the Alvlsq
started out from that wharf.-; The Alvlsd
was going at a pretty good ' rate" of speed
when her nose shot out Into the stream.
Bells jangled on both vessels. â¢ Wild ex
citement prevailed among the passengers
on the Amador. . Both , vessels stopped
their engines, then went full speed astern.
Before "the boats began ; to make stern
way,' however, they were within a foot of
each other. ! ! .' 'â¢:

During the height of the storm the
schooner Bd-dy parted her anchor chain
and fouled the scow schooner Fannie, ly
ing 1 at the seawall, carrying away the
latter' s jibboom and foremast and so bat
tering her hull that the Fannie filled with
water and sank. Her deck load of lum
ber was washed away and what is left
of the Fannie will hardly'bo worth patch-
Ing up.
The storm -was felt most severely at
Meiggs wharf. Deceived by the calm that
prevailed at sunset, the engineer of the
General Steinberg had blown out his
boilers and was 1 unable to move to shelter
when the gale broke. A. tug -was sent
for a^Â»d th.es Quarantine boat taken to the
Mall dock, but not until the port rail had
been carried away and her sides badly
chafed against the wharf. State pile
driver No. 2 was driven against Meiggs
whaxf. Her house was carried away and
the wharf considerably damaged. A pile
driver a-t old Fishermen's wjcarf was
roughly handled and at Uniorl street the
wind blew to smithereens the house on an
other piledriver. The schooner Horace

job into a heavy loss.
Considerable damage was done to

Joe ChqynsKi will meet the .winner of
the Gardner-Root fight. : The Calif ornian
heavy-weight is in Chicago, -but will start
for the coast immediately^ , ! . Â¦Â¦* .
The officials of the Yosemite ( Athletic
Club j have the promise of-, both Root and
Gardner that : whichever man wins wilt
take on Choynski at catchwelghts -on Feb
ruary 28. -.-.'. Choynski has been anxious to'
get into the ring again; and Â¦ this offers
him a most ..promising match.. I u- . .' ;
Betting is., still light; on to-morrow
night's contest.-. It is expected consider
able wagering will be done to-day,- when
a correct' line can be obtained on ; the esti
mation in which the public holds the men.
A Chicago writer says this â¢ will ' be
Roofs hardest battle. .Had the' match
been made two years ago Root would
have been/ favorite. \ In Gardner's- present
form he .is considered ' the best middle
weight in the country; Gardner is warned
not to underrate Root, as he. is a hard
proposition to beat. In Chicago therearo
a number of people who like- : Root's
chances. Among these is.' Jack- Moffatt,'
who has fought both men. He thinks Root
will win inside ten rounds, vf Â¦ : : - .
J. J. , Dukelow, ' who fought
several times in the Olympic Club, . will
box Kelly in one of the 'pre
liminaries. Toby Irwin injured his hand
and cannot go on."'. :â¢'Â¦.Â¦Â¦ Â¦>â¢Â¦.-' â¢-Â¦ â¢':
Leaves Chicago at\ Once, for
This City to G-b Into
Trailing.
Frank Weir's mare Bab carried the wise
coin to win the closing mile and fifty yard
selling run, going to the post a 7- to 5
choice. She also managed to get away
from the barrier among the tail lenders',
and, with the wire in sight, was collared
and beaten a neck by Aloha II, ridden by
Mounce: The winner was at one time last
of the bunch, looking hopelessly out of it.
There was any amount of speed gath
ered together in the six furlong run, and
it was thought Tower of Candles, with
99 pounds up, could do the trick. Caesar
Young's mare ruled a 7 to 5 favorite and
had Jackson happened to get away bet
ter she could undoubtedly" | have won.
As it was, the first . choice - experienced
some difllculty in getting to the front, and
then found Vantlne to keep her company.
Burns gradually threaded his way up with
Redwald and. catching Candles all out
won driving by half a length in 1:13%,
Vantine led Afghan out for third place."
i The mile selling; run looked such a cer
tainty on paper for Commissioner Forster
that the books, held the colt a 2 to 5
chance. % Arigato and Ada N cut out the;
running for over three-quarters of the dis
tance, ?.when' Jackson sent- the favorite
along. He scored handily in 1:41%. Under
O'Connor's. urging, Cougar got up in time
to beat Ada N for the place. ;
Sending Quietto. the post wearing blink-'
ers .worked wonders with- - the Goldfinch;
,colt. Quoted a 5 to 1 chance in the betting
: in the six and a , half j furlong run, he
picked up 122 pounds and won running
away. Mounce, on Jingler, the 4 to 5 fa-;
vorite, rode as if he thought the distance
to be covered was four miles, and succeed
ed in losing the place to Chftndoo, a 10 to 1
shot. ,", /
Sharp Bird finally struck some company
in the first event that he could defeat. The
Ezell and Lazarus - sprinter .went to the
post an. 8 to 5 favorite; and won going
away at the end. Hoar, on. Dollie "Weith
off, finished second, a length before Ti-:
buron." â¢ . ?.;Â¦.'.Â«* â¢ .->;''Â¦ - -
After the successes of Sharp" Bird â¢ and
Commissioner Forster,, favorites played in
hard luck, failing, to take- a purse. Red
wald, piloted by Tommy- Burns, furnished
the. biggest surprise of the "afternoon by
beating si field of sprinters in the fifth
event at odds of 15 and 20 to 1. .
f Over, a' fast track and /'with twelve
pounds off, the black colt won the Macdon
oughfhandicap, yesterday. , in, .rag time,
leading. old.Floronso out with pounds to
spare in 1:40%. -Unfortunately. Jake Holt
man. was .not seen/at . h^s. best- .With. . the,
barrier, for. the chances of Watercure, the.
7 to 10 favorite, carrying top weight and
ridden by Lee Jaokson, were ruined at the
start; . the;: chestnut not '.- - being, exactly
straight when the webbing flew in the air.
MacGyle,the only other starter, "was also
away poorly.- Three toil was laid about
the winner. '-',-. . â¢ . / .' I- " , ' . â¢Â¦ -"

they are liable to appear upon other parts
of the body. When they begin to spread
and eat into the fiesh, sharp, piercing
pains are felt as the underlying tissue is
destroyed and the tender nerves exposed.
Cancerous sores develop from very trifling
causes; a carbuncle or boil, swollen gland,
a little watery blister on the tongue or
lip, a wart, mole or bruise of some kind

presented with a gold watch by his pupils
The presentation was made by 6. A
Hensley and Miehling made a stammering
response.
The drill pi eighteen cadets from the
Mount Tamalpals Military Academy, un
der the leadership of Captain Murdock,
was a fine feature. Professor Louis
Tronchet and E. Orton gave exhibitions
with the broadsword and with rapiers,
both of which were warmly applauded
Charles Carroll's fine manipulation of the
punching bag was greatly appreciated.
Exciting boxing bouts were given by J.
M. Lundie and James Pallas, Louis Rich
ards and Joseph Collins. The Garcia
brothers did a clever slack wire. act and
Du Bell followed with some excellent
trapese work which roused general ex>
citement. His apparent fall while balanc
ing himself blindfolded evoked many fem
inine shrieks. The closing number was an
act by a family of acrobats from the
Orpheum, and being professional was
necessarily of the character to enthuse.
The events were under the general di
rection of John A. Hammersmith. The
rendition of the programme proceeded
without a hitch and each number was
loudly applauded^ Otto Rittler opened the
evening with some fine club swinging.
The Leando brothers followed with com
edy acrobatics. There were several hotly
contested wrestling bouts between Charles
Jenkins and G. A. Hensley, each winning
a fall. Ixmls Kullmaii and Edward B\
Murphy also won honors. George Schlit
ter and O. Rittler then did some excellent
work on the rings.
The gymnasium of the Olympic Athletic
Club was crowded to its capacity last
night, the occasion being ladies' night.

delegates to the diocesan convention.
There were also many members present .of

rendered national and popular airs in the

- A quarter of a century ago Sisters Mag
dalen and Constance decided to establish
a home for ' their order in some part, of
the United States.- The order was organ
ized Â¦ in Omaha and has been spread
throughout the West. In Omaha the or
der- has- .prospered and. large improve
ments j have just been' made to . the . con
vent so that facilities are at hand for the
treatment of diseases of all, descriptions.
The. work\of Sister- Constance among
the poor has been most praiseworthy in
this city and the sisters' are revered
among the poor. Several- hundred. of the
poor waited at the convent door for the
tidings from the mother superior when
the crisis in her illness was known to be
at hand. ' -'
Sixty-four - years ago the sister was
born in the Castle of St. Angelo. at Rome,
while her father was - Governor, of the
Italian Â¦ capital. She was! a descendant
of the -famous. house of Bentivoglio and
one of her brothers,' Count Bentivoglio, is
prominent- among Italian noblemen of
the day. Her father was a native of
Bologna, Italy, 'and all her relatives are
still in Europe with the exception of Sis

the Convent, of St. -Clare, at Evansville,

The Bal Poudre given last evenine un
der the auspices of twenty-two young la
dies in the smart set was a brilliant suc
cess, and as most of the young patron
esses were debutantes they are to be con
gratulated for having such .wise heads on
young shoulders. They managed 'the af
fair quite alone and each contributed her
share toward the total expense of the co
tillon. Bach member invited ten guests,
and one glance at Cotillon Hall last
evening was assurance enough that no
one stayed at home. The hostesses had
sent forth the fiat that no costuming was
expected, but that the hair was to be
powdered with true, colonial whiteness;

The Initiatory step in the organization
of the society was taken during the gold
en jubilee celebration In 1898. For the con
ception of the' idea credit must be given
to Mrs. John H. Jewett, wife of the presi
dent of the Society of California Pioneers
and a social leader, famed not- only for
the charming hospitality dispensed at her
own home, but also for the notable suc
cess achieved by "her in the management
of many of the functions which San Fran
cisco society has in the past recorded as
most enjoyable. .
The following women represent the so
ciety:
Upon its roll are many names that In
the preceding generation meant all that
was highest and best of the social life of
San Francisco, and some of the old-tirr.e
charming hospitality for which the early
days were noted may be looked for in the
entertaining of these ladies.
The Women's Auxiliary is a new or
ganization comprised of women whose
husbands or fathers belong to. the Society
of California Pioneers, and the fact that
they have recently filed articles of incor
poration is one of social as well as his
torical interest, inasmuch as this formal
act was the final step In the formation of
this most exclusive society, which prom
ises, if the names of the officers and its
charter roll of membership are any cri
terion, to become to California what the
Society of Colonial Dames is to America
generally. ,
THE Women's Auxiliary of the So
ciety of California Pioneers has
iTent out invitations for an assem
bly at Pioneer Hall to celebrate
the anniversary of the ceding of
California to the United States by Mex
ico. Saturday â¢ afternoon; February 1.
from 3 to 6 o'clock, is the time appointed
for the assembly, which will, be one of
the most important social events of the
season. Invitations issued have included
the army and navy, the universities, the
consuls and people of prominence socially
throughout the State. The names of the
ladies who receive are representative and
the gathering will no doubt be a notable
one.

Worthy of
Your Notice.
If you suffer with kidney disease
. or any ailment arising from an im-
proper action of the kidneys or
urinary organs, this offer we make
. to . the people, of .San Francisco
should interest you. In the ad-
vancement of medical science, the
kidneys, the organs of the greatest
Importance! to human- health, have
not been neglected, and in placing
before you such a cure as Doan'd
Kidney Pills ,the proprietors recog-
nize how far so many statements of
- the makers of similar preparations
have fallen short of their claims,
being convinced that no remedy for
. kidney complaints in ' existence
equals Doan's Kidney Pills for such
ailments; strengthened in these
. convictions by letters that are dally
received of the -.vork they are do-
ing for mankind's benefit, old backs
and young backs are being con-
stantly freed from never-ceasing
aches, and many a lame and shat-
tered one. stooped and contracted,
is strengthened, invigorated and in-
fused with new life. "With such a
â¢ medicine an offer of this kind can
be made without hesitancy, for
while we lose the box we give you.
we make a friend that assists ua in

ADVERTISEMENTS.An Oakland man, involved in the meshes of the
divorce court, has probably found the last reason on
earth for a divorce. He says he scented trouble with
his young wife even before marriage because she pos
itively to make bread such as his mother
had made. ' .
These reports are very different from what we have
been accustomed to 'after, former elections in which
machines were tested. They, point to the conclusion
that! the machines are .by; no means so 'near perfec
tion as was at one time thought. 'When operated as
a novelty : many, voters were_ delighted '.with them, but
now. they long for the old way. : \. Evidently -it-will pay.
California to wait a while : before investing Â¦ in the
machines^ , . : .
v In Buffalo the discontent is not quite so great as'
at Syracuse, but' even there complaints are . heard.
In New York City, where no machines were used,
the defective ballots disclosed ; irr-the count; did not
exceed three in every 100 ballots. Possibly a recount
might have shown more than the first 'count, as the
recount in this city is doing, "but, on. the returns as
stated j;he voting machines" are said to give nothing
like so good a showing. In one of the smaller towns,
of the State the machine recorded but three votes for
a popular candidate, and in a contest that followed
many: times that number of ""men swore they voted
for him. ' v " ; ":
Experiments with the machines were more, exten
sively, made in New York than in any^ other State,
and it is from various cities in that commonwealth .
that most of the reports of failure come. In Syra
cuse, where $30,000 was invested inl machines, it is;
said the people have become so dissatisfied with them'
that the city government has adopted an ordinance
dispensing with them hereafter. Among the reasons
given for the public dissatisfaction are. that, the ma
chines destroy the secrecy of the ballot, that -the
voters do not understand them and often become
confused, and that the > average voter finds it impos
sible-to so manipulate them as to vote a split ticket
when he wishes to. IV: V?
FOR one cause or another reports from the East
this year concerning the voting machines in use
during the recent elections are by no means so
uniformly favorable to the machines as they have
been in the past. # In fact, from some quarters the
statement of results is distinctly discouraging and
seems to lead to the conclusion that the machines
are by no means so .perfect as was formerly reported.
VOTING MACHINE % REPORTS.
An inquiring citizen who has been making investi
gations at Washjngton has discovered. that the of
ficers and clerks employed by the Senate draw more
pay in the aggregate than the Senate itself, and^he is
now trying to find out whether they do more work
than the Senators or are employed merely to orna
ment the Capitol.
Since it has-been seemingly so easy to procure the
consent of the Senate to the creation of the Depart
ment of Commerce there ought to be a fighting
chance for. the" Department of Mines: The one
which, has won' favor is certainly 'not more* needed
than'the other. The mining men "should . urge their
While the new department thus organized will
doubtless add to the effectiveness of the national ad
ministration, it can hardly be deemed more neces
sary than a Department of Mines and Mining. To
form the Department of Commerce and Labor- it
has been found- necessary to run a dragnet over the
other departments of the Government and to bring
together a collection of bureaus very slightly related.
Even if the Patent Office be stricken out there will
still remain in the department such bureaus as those
of the Geodetic Survey and the Fish and Fisheries,
which have no bearing upon foreign .commerce- nor
upon domestic labor. This medley of bureaus had to
be. brought together to form a great department.
No such combination would have to be devised in
forming a Department of Mines and Mining. That
industry alone would be sufficient to furnish work
for a Cabinet officer . and half a-dozen. chiefs of
bureaus under, him. Â¦
According to a report printed in the Congressional
Record some time ago the branches of the Govern
ment with the number of their employes and aggre
gate salaries which would be placed under the con
trol of the new department were given as -follows:
\ â¢ Aggregate
Employes, salaries.
Lighthouse Board ,32 $39,030
' Life Saving Service 29 42,780
Marine Hospital Service 29 36,100
Steamboat Inspection 7 11,740
Navigation Bureau , 21 j _26,2S0
Immigration Bureau 7 12,410
Bureau of Statistics '.27 #49,550
Coast and Geodetic Survey 202 272,500
Patent Office 605 C92.990
Department of Labor ...78 102,780
Fish and Fisheries ....... .' 38 49,160'
Bureau of Foreign Commerce ..... 10 * 12,720
In addition to those bureaus already existing there
was to be created a bureau of manufactures, which
would have a clerical force of thirty persons at an
aggregate salary of $53,000. y The bill was, amended
in several particulars in the Senate, and according to
the summary given by telegraph the measure as
passed confers upon the department not only the
control of the bureaus specified but also of the Cen
sus Bureau, of Chinese exclusion questions and cf
the consular service so far as it pertains to com
merce. In the telegraphic report the Patent Office
is not included in the list of bureaus transferred to
the department^ so it may be it was stricken out of
the original list. The|^e seems no reason why it
should ever have been included, since the granting of
patents has no close relation to commerce or labor.
/SENATOR NELSON'S bill creating a Depart-
ment of Commerce and Labor was adopted by
the â¢Senate on Tuesday, and it is believed will
pass the House without difficulty. There was at one
time a report that the new department would have
a bureau of mines and mining, so as to satisfy the de
mand for a better supervision of the mining indus
try, but the report was evidently unfounded, for no
such bureau is included in the list of those assigned
to the department. It is to be indeed a wide
spreading and far-reaching branch of the administra
tion, but it does not reach the mines.

In turning from, the material to the spiritual
condition of the church there ', is equal cause
for gratitude and encouragement. Beginning
with tnÂ« "Sunday schools, beyond question tht'
most essential department of church life, the
reports are extremely suggestive. There is a
gain over the previous year of 100 teachers
and an "estimated loss of 200 scholars. .
- Notwithstanding 'the cutting down by many
city parishes of the number of communicants
previously reported, so that the I living may
be reported from the dead, .there Is an increase,
over the report of last year of 500 communi

Â¦ The report was approved and placed on

" Archdeacon Emery submitted the report,,
of the -Diocesan Board of. Missions. In
part he said: ';.*->Â¦
"The missionary work in the diocese Is de
veloping on - three clearly defined lines : First,
that of the Bishop himself, who, with the
archdeacon and usually some other clergyman,
visits remote parts of the diocese where there
are no organized missions and no- resident
clergyâ during . the. pest year 1600 miles were
traveled and services : were held- -in 'nearly

the work done by the cathedral staff of I mis
sions, and - third, the regular work in the or
ganized missions of the Â¦ board-, with that
of the Cathedral Mission of the Good Sa

past twelve months to meet the resolutions of
fered last year by theVRev. Â¦ E. L. â¢ Parsons and
Major Hooper to diredtnew work to centers

Â¦ William A. ai. Van Bokkelen, . treasurer
of the diocese, called Â¦ attention to ' the

$8527 70; disbursements, l $8449 4ft; . disabled

The financial . condition of the archdiocese
not only Justifies its existence as a wise move
ment in church polity, but has. moreover far
exceeded the expectation of .its strongest ad
vocates. The growth of the second year .will
be apparent from the fact that the salaries and
expenses of the members of the staff, by rea-"
son of -Increased numbers, have exceeded that
of last year by $3500.
The summary of parochial . Improvements
during the last year amounts to Â§37,24tf 10.
The total of contributions received exceeds that
of the previous year by $54,S:S9 13. The sum
of $933 45 was contributed - during the pust
year for domestic and foreign missions.
Your committee would emphasize the changed
relations entered Into, since the last diocesan
convention, on the subject of missions â the
action of the diocese, on the one hand, in vol
untarily surrendering the annual sum of $000
heretofore received from the Board of Missions
in New York, and the action of the Board of
Missions on the other hand in calling for an
annual apportionment of a sum amounting to
$5272. .Whether this sum shall be realized is
a question which the future alone can deter
mine.
The financial condition shows a remarkable
advance over that of last year. Special at
tention is called to the wholesome state of the
consolidated investment of the perpetual tunds
of the diocese. The management of that trust
has been continued with a primary view to
its ultimate security and the results are euch
as to impart absolute confidence In diocesan
funded interests. One of 'the most encourag
ing, features will be found in the statement of
a perpetual trust received from the heirs of.
Mrs. Samuel M. Wilson, in the sum of $aO0O.
The morning session opened with pray
er, after which there was a discussion
of canons governing the election of rec
tors and the manner in which such elec
tions should be held. Reports of commit
tees were also" received.
i Rev. Frederick WA Clampett, rector of
Trinity Church, chairman of the commit
tee on the standing of the church, read
an Interesting report to the convention.
In part he said:
St. John's ; Church was . crowded
throughout the day. The discussions and
speeches of the delegates, both clerical,
and lay, were eagerly listened to and ap
preciated. . / '. .
THE feature of the Episcopal Dio
cesan Convention yesterday was
I the election of. standing /Â» commits
.â¢^â¢Â¦Â¦^teos for the ensuing year. There'
. were many candidates and the bal
loting was close and interesting.
It was proposed by the Rev. Mardon D.
Wilson and adopted unanimously that "a
committee of five be appointed by the
chairman to take into consideration the
whole subject of the relation of the
church in this diocese to the General
Another eloquent speech was delivered
by Henry Highton, who, in pleading for
adequate support of a church paper, allud
ed to the late convention as a moral and
spiritual power which will be long remem
bered. It" was memorable in the history
cf the church; it marked an .epoch. Re
said, not only of the history of the coast
but of the whole of the land and its influ
ence was felt far away in other countries.
Â» It seems that in the report of contribu
tions to the disabled clergymen's fund
Trinity's amount was omitted on Tues
day. Yesterday Major Hooper stepped
forward and smilingly flourishing a check
for $251 75. said that that was Trinity's
contribution, which he desired should be
recorded. * â¢
canonical amendments proposed by com
mittees and the reading of reports, nota
bly the annual review, by Bishop Nichols.
'The "Bishop read'a lengthy but none the
less Interesting report for the past year,
showing the amount of labor performed
by him. He spoke eloquently of the great
convention which had brought to Califor
nia so many persons of prominence. The
city has felt the magnificent influence of
that gathering. In concluding the Bishop
paid gentle tribute to their dead associ
ates, and probably to Bishop Whlpple,
whose personal charm and statuesque
figure and loving nature he feelingly de
scribed. Tribute was paid to the memory,
also, of Dr. Littlejohn and the late
Bishop Barker> R. M. Sherman, W. H.
Howard and J. J. Valentine.
Mr. John E. Russell, a deep thinker of Boston,
after maturely meditating upon American history,
has come to the conclusion that the War of the Revo
lution ended in our 'favor not so much because
of the victories at Saratoga' and Yorktown as be
cause the British people were tired of it. This may
be cited as one of the few cases where deep thinking
actually reaches bedrock.
Routine work and the adoption of some
amendments advised by the committee of
canons brought the busy day's proceedings
to a close.

Let. it be borne in mind there is no opposition to
horse racing,. but only to track gambling. Further-,
more, let it be remembered that the protest of the
people should be made at the meeting of the Super
visors on Monday. To sit in idleness until a wrong
be accomplished and -then denounce it is folly.
Action against this wrong should be prompt as well'
as emphatic.
If for any reason the Supervisors should be heed
less of these things the people should compel their
attention. The issue* is .to come- before the board
next Monday. The voice of the protest of San Fran
cisco should be uttered then and uttered emphatically.
It is an issue which concerns alike the homes and
the business of men. There is no class of our peo
ple which has not had some relative or friend brought
to ruin by track gambling. The dreary, dismal rec
ord of thefts, forgeries, embezzlements, murders and
suicides that followed the story of track gambling
when Ingleside was open in the past cannot have
passed away from the minds of the people. For the
sake of saving the city from a repetition of such evils
all good citizens should unite in making a; protest
against the movement to renew the track gambling
privilege.
These particular frauds are not great. They will
not stir indignation like some of the many frauds
and crimes which resulted from track gambling at
Ingleside in the old days. Their occurrence just at
this time, however, renders them pertinent to the
question of reopening Ingleside. They show the na
ture of the frauds and wrongs that are going on all
the time as the inseparable accompaniments of race
track gambling. These have happened this.vveek.
Next week there will be others. This week the
frauds are petty. Next week there may be crimes of
the highest magnitude, murder and suicide.
The other incident is of a very different nature.
A discharged soldier was on Tuesday detected in an
effort to get a cheap ride to Chicago by getting him
self shipped in a box as freight. Taken to the police
station he explained that he had served in' the Phil
ippines and had been honorably discharged . from the
sen-ice. A short time ago he had money to a con
siderable amount, but he "played the races," with the
usual result. He soon found himself unable to pay
his fare to his home, and, despairing of finding em
ployment here, he undertook the risky experiment of
getting himself shipped in a freightcar.
The first case is that of the so-called "Plunger"
Lewis, who after a brief career of success at the track
ended by passing a worthless check upon a confiding
bookmaker. The plunger, when called upon to ex
plain his action in giving the check, is reported to
have said that he had discovered he was being
"jobbed" by certain parties and was playing to get
even. That is a sample of the track gambling fra
ternity. It shows the kind of men who are attracted
to the city by that form of gambling. It is an illus
tration of the sort of people who would hasten to
San Francisco to ply their trade and play their tricks
if once we were to permit this to become a track
gambling resort, as it was in the days before Ingle
side was dosed.
WHILE the Supervisors are pondering
whether or no to reopen Ingleside racetrack
for a season of track gambling current
events are furnishing them with object lessons show
ing the results of that sort of gambling even when
carried on at a distance from the city. Scarcely had
the resolution to permit gambling at Ingleside been
introduced into the board before it was disclosed
that employes of municipal offices have been in the
habit of neglecting their duty and wasting their time
at the racetrack. Now come two other examples of
the consequences of track gambling, each in its way
worthy of more than a passing notice from those who
arc asked to vote in favor of further track gambling.

In contrast with the large national views of the
President the narrow sectionalism- of Sibley and his
followers is seen to be small and pitiful. It is as
erroneous as it is narrow. Pennsylvania farmers will
be benefited and not injured by the development of
the West. Even were the Sibley idea correct, how
ever, it would still be an- invalid argument, for its
logical conclusion would be that we must doom a
large area of the country to permanent barrenne'ss
for fear of injuring the East. It is the duty of Con
gress to deal with the nation as a whole, and in the
end it will. The time will come when the opponents
of the development of the arid lands will be as much
ashamed of their course as were those men who in
times past opposed the homestead act, which brought
about the settlement of the humid lands.
Congress and to. the country, by the President him
self. In his message, the President .says: "The
reclamation and; settlement of the arid lands will en
rich every portion of our country just as the^settle
ment of the Ohip and Mississippi valleys brought
prosperity to the Atlantic States. The increased de
mand for manufactured articles will stimulate indus
trial production, while wider home markets and the
trade of Asia will consume the larger food supplies
and effectually prevent Western competition with.
Eastern agriculture. Indeed the products of irriga
tion will be consumed in upbuilding local centers of
mining and other industries, which would otherwise
not come into existence at' all. 'Our people as n a
whole will profit, for the successful home-making is
but another name for the upbuilding of the nation."
Fortunately the national view of the case in oppo
sitionto the sectional view has been presented to
The nature of Eastern objections to the enterprise
was made manifest by the speech . of Congressman
Sibley of Pennsylvania, who made the chief argU;
ment against it in the House when under considera
tion a short time ago. The burden "of Sibley's pro
test , was that irrigation is a scheme to open up many
millions of acres of land to compete 'with Eastern
farms. The plea is a sectional one, but it doubtless has
many supporters.- . We will have to meet it and re
fute it.
another kind."
The President is heartily in favor of the enterprise.
In his message to Congress he devoted consider
able space /to the reclamation of our arid lands and
said: "Far-reaching interstate problems are in
volved, and the resources of single States would often
be inadequate. \ It is properly a national function,
at least in some of its features. It is as right for the
National Government to make the streams and rivers
of the arid region useful by engineering works for
water, storage as to make useful the rivers and \ har
bors of the. humid region by engineering works of
While the outlook is thus discouraging .there is
no reason for abandoning the effort. If a \ further
campaign. of education on the subject be needed; now
is the time to begin it, and Congress " is the best
place in which to carry it on. The House does not
allowmuch opportunity for debate, but it has already
had one discussion on the measure and others, will
follow. There will be some chance at least for a full
presentation of the merits >f the plan, and_ something
will be gained by making such presentation. Y
REPORTS from Washington /are not, encour
aging to. the hopes of 'the supporters of the
arid lands bill. \ .While the Senate Committee
on Public Lands has favorably reported the bill
agreed on by the Senators and Representatives from
the semi-arid States, it is. said there is so strong an
opposition to it in the House that it is feared it will
be beaten by upward of 150 majority. : . â¢;
THE ARID LANDS BILL.
Archduchess Elizabeth of Austria, who recently ab
dicated all rights to succession to the throne for the
sake of marrying the man. she loves, made a. better
bargain than appeared by the first reports," for in con
sideration of the surrender 'of her imperial heritage
she received a yearly -.llowance of $250,000, securities
valued at $1,600,000, and family jewels estimated to
be worth $1,000,000.. Evidently the gracious lady un
derstands business as well as love, and. her husband
has a "prize. -
cannot settle the question at this session, then by all
means it should be left to the President. The new
bill in the Senate is 011 the right track and should be
backed by Â¦ all the force of . public opinion. Let us
have a canal 1 bill. at this session. Any route N is bet
ter than none.
- The people, in short, are in favor of a canal and
are not devoted .to any particular route. The men
who in Washington have been shouting "Nicaragua
or nothing" do not represent any considerable por
tion of the American people. It is safe to say*a
majority of those who are in favor of one route as
against the other would still prefer to have the other
route adopted than to submit to longer delay in un
dertaking the work. The demand is for an isthmian
canal. Upon the question of routes the country is
ready to compromise rather than to lose the canal
itself or to indefinitely postpone it. If Congress
However strongly certain interests may be in favor
of one route as against the other, the great majority
of the people would rather have a canal by
route than to have further delay and wrangling. The
President may not be able to decide any morevwisely
than Congress, but he can decide more quickly. If
we are to wait for a Congressional decision no man
knows when the decision will be made, but if the
choice be left to the President we may count on
prompt action. There is no ground for questioning
the President's impartiality between the two routes
nor to doubt that he would make the decision with
an eye single to the best interests of the whole
country. . t
The comparative merits of the' two routes have
been sufficiently investigated, reported upon and can
vassed. It is known that each has some advantages
over the other. By a natural operation of the mind
all who are sufficiently interested in the subject to
give it any earnest consideration reach a conclusion
in favor of one" route rather than the other. It is use
less to. expect all of them to agree as to which route
is preferable. The opponents of any canal could not
more effectively win their case than by getting up a
prolonged controversy over the two routes. The de
lay thus, caused might be interminable. ' The issue
might even be made a sectional one, by arraying the
populous East in favor of Panama as more, favorable
to Eastern interests, while the West and South
would be combined in favor of Nicaragua. Thus a
deadlock would be formed which could be ended only
by an appeal to the country, and we should have tp
wait many years for the beginning of a work in
which there should be no delay at all.
BY way of settling the isthmian canal' con
troversy between the advocates of the Nicar
agua route and those of the Panama route a
bill has been introduced into the Senate authorizing
the President to determine which* is the better route
and to proceed with the work of construction. This
bill will, we believe, have the approval of the.coun
try. If adopted it will remove the dangej of a long
controversy in Congress and prepare a way for a
speedy settlement of an issue which now* threatens to
Iwcorae one of partisan politics.

Director Woodward announced that he
will move at the next meeting 1 to create
a contingent fund to be used by the prin
cipals for petty repairs. Woodward said
that some $5000 of school funds was ex
pended by the Board of Works to repair
schools, yet the school directors have no
voice as to how the work shall be done.
Woodward said that requisitions for sup
plies were presented for his signature
three weeks after they were furnished to
the Building Bureau. .
Miss Emily Hartrick of the Cooper Pri
mary School - was granted two weeks'
Superintendent Webster reported that
Joseph O'Connor, principal of the Mission
High School, had fixed a time schedule
contrary to tha rules of the board. The
pupils are- called at 8:38 a. m., are allowed
one and one-half hours for lunch and
dismissed at 3 p. m. Director Mark ex
plained that O'Connor had been given
permission by former president Mrs. Kin
caid to try the schedule as an experiment.
Mark will Investigate the allegation that
many pupils have left the school rather
than submit to the schedule.
Director Woodward protested when
the beard was about to order the pur
chase of supplies under contract from
Payot, Upham & Co., on the grÂ»und that
Henry Payot/ a- member of the firm, is
also a member of the Board of Super
visors. Woodward directed attention to
the fact that the charter forbade the
award of contracts to any city officials.
President Denman thereupon notified
Storekeeper McAultffe not to buy any
more supplies from the firm named and
the contract will be rescinded. This action
will result in a loss to the firm of J70OO
or $8000 yearly, as that amount of sup
plies has been furnished annually by it
to the School Department. /
Supervisor Payot Loses Contract.
The Board of Education met yesterday
and set next Tuesday at 2 p. m. as the
time to hear the charges preferred against
Miss Mary C. McKinney by Principal Al
bert Lyser. Judge Hunt decided that the
board could not suspend a teacher pend
ing an investigation and Â¦" Attorney Cos
tello filed a petition -that Mis* McKinney
be reinstated. Mr. Costello held that put
ting Miss McKinney on the eligible list
with pay was a degradation and Director
Woodward and Superintendent Webster
agreed with him. The board held, how
ever, that Miss McKinney had not been
degraded and declined to assign her to a
class. In his peitition Attorney Costello
says:
The history of Miss McKinney' s case is the
history of a grass outrage perpetrated against
a teacher In our schools.* The preferring of
the charges of Insanity against Miss McKin
ney by Professor Albert Lyser was a cowardly
act and should meet with the reprobation of
this board as it' has met with the condemna
tion of the press and the. people of this com
munity. In the face of the fact that the par
ents of every pupil in Miss McKinney* s â¢ clasa
earnestly petitioned the former Board of Edu
cation that she be retained. in her position and
that the only representative of the Board of
Education who visited Miss McKinney' 3 class
in the John Swett Grammar School reported
that' she was a successful teacher, the former
Board of Education saw fit to suspend Miss
McKinney from her position as ' a regular
teacher in the department and place her on
the eligible list, although with full pay.
The ruling of Judge Hunt was also ap
plicable to the case of Professor 'William Zim
merman, who was unlawfully suspended by
this board. I respectfully submit that Pro
fessor Zimmerman be restored to his former
position or if this would be productive of dis
cord in the Polytechnic High School that he
be assigned to some school of equal grade.
O. A. Tveltmoe, secretary of the Build
ing Trades Council, protested against the
purchase for the schools of desks and
furniture made by non-union labor In the.
Ka.at. The beard, took the protest under
advisement. A similar protest was filed
with the Board of Supervisors.
Mls3 Ada Goldsmith, on the recom
mendation of the principal of the Mission
High School, was appointed head of the
history department of the school.
The City Attorney was requested to
take action so as to enable the School
Department to secure possession of tha
land belonging to it on the northwest
corner of Thirteenth and Fillmore streets
The Board of Supervisors was requested
to order graded Dorland street, between.
Church and Dolores, and to order a side
walk to be laid on the west side of
Dolores street, between Dorland and

"Plunger" Lewis has left , behind two
crowds to regret his sudden departure for
the more hospitable blizzard belt. The
bookmakers who ' lost by his "welching"
are probably., not half so much perturbed
over his departureâ for after all he made
betting panickyâ as are the set of fellows
who have been lying awake nights devis
ing ways to separate . the nervy, bettor
from his suddenly acquired wealth.'.
Some of ; these plotters , "landed," and
Monday night a faro, game was , "framed
up" for him, and it is said that when he
stopped bucking it he was several thou
sand dollars poorer. â¢
The total amount owed by Lewis at the
track is $1950, distributed as follows: C.
Young, $350; Cash . & Co., $100; Melbourne
Club, $200; Joe Rose, $300; Hoffman & Co.,
$200; A. Andrews, $300;. Frank Eckart,
$300; Harlan & Co.; $300.
The horses, Pompino and Marlon Lynch,
which . Lewis was supposed to own, are
held by ; S. Judge,' their former owner, by
virtue of a bill of sale. -. . ' , ;
, The. plunger got away, it Is said, on
money obtained by pledging diamond ear
rings which he had presented to a fair ad

him $400 originally.

I was crazy drunk and did not know what I
was doing. Â¦ I went in the saloon and it looked
like there were a dozen men there. Â¦ The wo
man who telephoned to me about the dog is
Louise Alverea. When I received the tele
phone message from her I was In Bloomer's
saloon at Golden Gate avenue and Jones
street. The telephone message came Into the
Golden Gate stables. . I went to Â¦ the stables
and talked to Louise. She' said something
about her dog being stolen by the people in
thft grocery. She said she was out on Hayes
street and I said I'd get the dog for her. I
wont into the saloon and said, "Give me the
dog," and a man jumped up at me and the
gun went oft. I took the pistol out of my
pocket so the men would give me the dog.
The gun went oft! while I had hold of It.
Nobody touched' me and nobody, touched -the
gun. I went to Bloomer's after I telephoned
and had one more drink. I then went out on
the Hayes-street car. I got off at Franklin
street' or by the church; I met Louise before
I went into the saloon. She said, "They stole
my dog; they stole. my dog." She said they
stole it in the store. I said I would go in and
try to get it for her. I am not sure that sba
went in with me. She did not name any one
who stole the dog. I had my pistol in my
pocket for a few months. I hadno permit to
carry it. I carried the pistol because Charles
McDennott threatened to kill me. I think
McDermott lives on Mission street. . He is a

trouble over the drinks at Bloomer's. He said,
"I'll cut your guts out." He did not try to do
It. -I have seen him since then. .He was in
the saloon the other night and I was talking
to him. I think- the gun went off the second
time. I don' t know whom I shot at. I was
drunk and shaking and the gun went off. I

to her house. I gave the doe to Louise. I got
it from Dr. Frezll of Bakersfleld. I got it
about two months ago. Louise rented the

GRAND CONCLAVE OF THE KNIGHTS
TEMPLAR TO BE HELD IN THIS CITY
The true story regarding John C.
Lynch's indorsement by the leading
banks of San Francisco is no longer a
secret in so far as It relates to the pre
sentation of the document to President
Roosevelt. The directors and stockhold
ers of the Bank of California, the Ne
vada Bank, San Francisco National Bank,
Crocker- Woolworth Bank, Wells, Fargo
& Co.'s Bank and the Anglo-Californian
Bank may want to know the special rea
sons for- the indorsement of Lynch by
their respective banks, but for this in
formation they must apply to their man
agers and cashiers. The Call at this time
can only tell them that the indorsement
of the San Francisco banking-houses was
presented to . the President by Mose3
Gunst ; of the Washoe Bank'. There was
a little ceremony attending the presenta
tion. At , a leading hotel in Washington
George A. Knight, W. C. Van Fleet,
Moses Gunst and Julius Kahn sat down
to lunch and affairs of state were dis
cussed. At length the subject of finance
was introduced, which led â¢ naturally to
banking topics and ultimately to the me-,
morlal from the San Francisco banks.
Moses Gunst produced the paper with the
original signatures, and it was the sense
of the party at lunch that he should take
it to the White House and : place it in
the hands of the President. Later on the
party was advised that Moses Â¦ had done
his duty. . Â¦ ~'
Bank Managers Take a Hand.
The politicians are also asking the ques
tion: "Can Gage be elected again?" It
is claimed by some of the keen observers
that the machine Is strong enough to
force his nomination, but the question
presents itself: "Will the voters of the
State stand for a nomination forced by
the machine?" Republicans will tolerate
a good deal of programming- for the sake
of party unity, but It has been clearly
demonstrated that they will not submit
to as raw a programme as that which
Herrin and < Burns forced on the local
convention which nominated Asa R,
Wells for Mayor and Arthur G. Fisk for
District Attorney. The delegates to the
convention did not know who the candi
dates were until the bosses handed them
a slip containing the names. There is
bound to be a vigorous protest on thÂ»
part of anti-boss Republicans against the
appointment of delegates . to the next
State convention.-''
The primary election law stands and is
likely to stand until the Legislature re
peals it. The spirit of the law is to give
voters the right to select delegates to the
nominating, conventions of their respec
tive parties. In San Francisco at the last
primary election at least 6000 Democrats
took part in. the election of delegates to
the Republican convention. At the pri
mary election next August the Democrats
will probably take a hand In electing the
delegates to their own party convention.
If the Democrats can find an issue and
a candidate of great popularity they will
make a big fight to carry the State.
The announcement on the. part .of .Dr.
Pardee that he is a candidate for the Re
publican nomination for Governor will
give George Hatton, the manager of Sen
ator Perkins, a splendid opportunity to
display his. skill as a balancer. Hatton
cannot to give Pardee a point at
the expense of Gage, and neither can he
do anything for Gage which would tend
to embarrass Pardee. Hatton must per
force abide in the neutral zone and sing
sweetly to all the candidates for Gover
nor or utter no sound whatever. Senator
Perkins confidently relies on a solid dele
gation from Alameda County, and his
manager must see to it that nothing shall
prevent that result. When it conies to a
balancing trick the "Senator is a pretty
good hand i himself, and for this special
occasion the manager may become the
understudy. Â¦ -
Can Gage Be Elected Again?
The Ix>s Angeles politicians raised the
money and brought out the Republican
vote of that region. Harrison carried
California by a majority approximating
7000. In 1890 the .leading Republicans of
the north went to the State convention
at Sacramento and assisted in nominating
H. H. Markham for Governor. Moreover,
the northern and central Republican
counties elected him. Markham made a
statement to the State Central Commit
tee at the beginning of the campaign that
he would carry his own county of Loa
Angeles by- five thousand. The majority
was ,3500 below his estimate. The un
wavering Republicans north of Tehachapi
pulled him through. If Stanford's man
ager had not used a barrel of money to
aid candidates for the Legislature E. B.
Pond would have walked away with the
gubernatorial prize.
The politicians are discussing the ques-'
tion; "Is Gage in honor bound to stand by
the pledges made by his southern sup
porters at the Sacramento : State - conven
tion^ 1898?" When the Republican State
convention of that year gav& the nomina
tion for Governor to the south the dele
gates . from the southern counties assured
the convention that they ; -would all stand
in for, a man from the north for Gover
nor in 1902. Pledges of this character
have been respected in California. In
the Harrison campaign 1888 the State
Central -Committee surveyed the - flelu
carefully and resolved to enlist if possi
ble earnest and enthusiastic work in the
countless south of Tehachapi. It was
known that there. h2d been a large im
migration" to that section since the pre
eeuing election of I88ti and special enTort
was advisea to get me newcomers regis
tered. Tne .Los Angeles politicians were
told by. the atate committee that the
north would stand in 1 or , a Republican
trom the south lor Governor in lsai) If the
.Republicans of - the south would raise *a
certain sum or money for campaign ex
penses and bring out the full Republican
vote south, of Tehachapi lor Harrison.
Tne agreement was made and carried out.

CHICAGO, . Jan. 29. â While trade in wheat
was not so brisk as in corn and oats, the
volume .was. greater and this pit became the
leading speculative market. General bullish
conditions prevailed. . Cables were much higher,
though 1 there was no advance here yesterday.
There was a report of fair export business and
Northwestern and local receipts were very
small and local offerings were scanty., -Coarse
grains were well up, especially in the Western
markets." Commission houses had very good
buying orders and scalpers were the only ones
who sold early. . May opened. %@%c up at
78%Â®78?4c and mounted steadily to 79c. Kan
sas City reported little movement of wheat to
market because Interior mills were paying
higher prices. Even on the advance ttiere was
an absence of selling pressure. May closed
strong. 1%@1%c higher, at 78%@70c.
Strength in corn was the prime influence on
the board to-day. Cables were higher, there
were reports of foreign buying, the Argentine
crop was Â«aid to be damaged and local re
ceipts were small. May closed strong, l}^@2c
higher, at 62%c.
Oats traders settled down to the belief that
the pit was solid for the time being .at least,
and liquidation by outsiders seemed over. . May
closed very strong with a net gain of 2}Â£@2%f
at 44 Vic. Â¦Â¦- .
The market for provisions gained material
6trength from grains, though there was a nat
ural flrmness from the light receipts and bet
ter prices at the yards. Short covering also
helped the upward movement. May pork closed
27%c higher; lard 15c higher and ribs 12%c
higher.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
It now appears that the shipment of Eggs
to the East were two cars of Eastern (sent
back) and one car of Californian. This cleaned
up the market very well for the moment, but
receipts during, the past two days have been
much larger, those yesterday being the heaviest
of the season, so the improvement in stocks is
not expected to last more than a day or two.
The market is quoted steady and unchanged.
There is nothing new In Butter and Cheese.
The former is well cleaned I up and firm, for
fancy creameries especially, while the - latter
is still handicapped by heavy stocks.
Receipts were 29,600 pounds, 31 tubs and

Prospects for Hay.
The private circular of Somers & Co., under
dare of Tuesday, January 28. says:
""The total receipts of Hay for the week
ending to-day amount to but 2000 tons, which
are the lightest arrivals we have had for quite
a while past. The week preceding showed a
total of 2000 tons. The rainy weather of a
week aso tended to lessen shipments some
what and the dry cool weather immediately
following had the same effect. It is true that
prospects are none too encouraging in all the
hay and grain districts, and although the rain
fall has been but slight yet we think there
should be no fear at this early date of a crop
failure. The present situation ' is tending to
Btiffen up prices somewhat, not only because
of the weather,- but because of the fact that
many larre country districts- are short of hay
and are drawing heavily from our regular
stocks in inany places. It seems at present
as if prices for Hay should rule quite strong
for the balance of the season, no matter what
future conditions might be. Of course if It
Bh< uld remain dry for any length of time there
will be quite a 6care with a somewhat sharp
advance, but even with copious rains in the
vc>y near future we do not see why prices
should decline any from the present range
"Although the continued cool weather has
b*?en very beneficial to orchardists. yet grain
has rr.ade but very slight growth, and we
should have warmer weather and more rain
shortly to insure good crops everywhere."
(Since the above circular was 6ent out the
market has advanced sharply under the influ

London Market.
NEW. YORK. Jan. 29. â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The stock market was characterized by gen
eral buoyancy to-day, on the Boer peace news,
which was unknown yesterday during business
hours. Consols jumped % to 94 7-16. largely
on Continental orders. Kaffirs, which last
night boomed in the street until 8 o'clock,
weakened this . morning, as Mr. Balfour's
statement, on careful reading, was less con
vincing that peace was in fair prospect. Never
theless the Continent came very strong and
the market rdused again and boomed until the
close, when it eased off on realizations.
Rio Tintos closed at 44%, after touching
American stocks seem to be forgetting the
uncertainty that hangs over the Northern Se
curities Company and were hard here, being
hoisted in the afternoon by New York's big
order in United States Steel.

The Situation in Wall Street.
The New York circular of Henry Clews
eaye:
"It Is significant that railroad earnings,
Â¦w'aile excellent, are not showing as large in
creases as a .year ago. and that decreases are
becoming more frequent. Exports are declin
ing and commodity prices show a downward
rather than upward tendency. It seems quite
likely that lower prices for both stocks and
commodity would stimulate general activity;
tor the present high level certainly restricts
transactions. The technical position of the
si ck market, however, is just now entirely
aO verse to a serious decline. The big men are
pi . sistently sustaining values; money is plentl
f i i and easy, and the enlargement of the short
ii.ierest is an element of strength. The ex
ec .lent demand for bonds from investors is a
r- tjd feature and. as previously intimated in
tl-.ese advices, the conditions are so favorable
f< r the floating of new issues that the creation
of considerable new capital on this basis seems
probable. As the general eituation continues
eound. we may look for a good trading mar
k(t, inducing us to repeat our former advice
or selling on fharp rallies and buying only
good etocks on the declines for quick turns and
moderate profits."
sales as to repress any tendency to advance
beyond small fractions. The contingent of
bear traders was quick to take advantage of
this situation and to offer down prices, taking
the market away from the sellers. The char
acter of the whole market thereupon relapsed
into a rut of dullness and professionalism.
The animation of yesterday's late demand had
aroused strong hopes that the great banking
interests v.-hlch control the large railroad sys
tems were once more embarked upon a move
ment to put up prices and make a market for
syndicate holdings of securities. The disap
pointment at to-day's developments was cor
respondingly keen. The speculation felt acutely
the lack of the stimulating effect of the re
cent strength in Amalgamated Copper. That
stock continued easily the. leader of the market
in point of activity and made an actual'ad
vance of a fraction. When it seemed to be
yielding the sympathetic effect upon the rest
of the market was immediate. The reason for
its reaction was not disclosed. Conditions re
mained unchanged so far as was known. The
price of the metal was lifted another fraction
and the buying in London continued very large.
The stock lost 2% on the day. closing, within
a shade of the lowest. Sugar showed the effect
of disappointment over the failure to advance
refined sugars and lost 1% on the day. The
large volume of trading in these two special
ties gave them large influence on the market.
A number of unfavorable reports of December
net earnings were a deprsslng influence. The
action of. the United Mine Workers' convention
in providing for a strike fund had a somewhat
sinister effect on ,the trading. Money con
tinued to grow easier.
The bond market became irregular in sym
pathy with the weakness of the stocks. Total
sales, par. value, $3,500,000.
Â¦ United States 5s registered advanced % per
cent on the last call. â¢Â¦

Horace Watson, a Southern Pacific train

The accident Is one of a series which has
been occurring to gravel trains that are
being operated between the new pits at
Pleasanton and Summit, east of Altamont.
' Besides his internal Injuries, which are
so serious,' "VVatson suffered , the fracture
of several ribs. His home is at 917 Ade

' Engineer S. Harris Hobron, who re
sides at 946 Union street, in this city, Was
in charge of the wrecked locomotive.
It is said that one cause for the wreck
can be found in the weakening of track
joints by the pounding i of the Â¦.' heavy
compound engines that are in service.
The rails through that section of the
country, where the wrecks have ' been
frequent of late, are light, and are not
adapted to the heavy rolling-stock, par

by two sailors,'. who had been captured by
Filipinos j and" taken ' to a' camp In the
mountains about thirty days' march out
of Manila. There they fell in with'Cor
poral Hayes,' who was a: prisoner in the
hands of a band of Filipinos. The sailors
further stated that there was no truth in
the story published that Corporal Hayes
had 'been shot in the trenches while de
serting, but that on the. contrary, he had
been seized a' little way out of Manila
Â¦while walking with a native woman and
had been rushed' to. the ! mountain camp,
where he died of consumption in January,'
1901.' The ; War Department, Slme said,
was appealed to and made an investiga
tion, which resulted In obtaining verifica
tion of the statement made by the sailors.
The result of that inquiry has been trans
mitted to Thomas J. McCreagh of the.
Custom-house in this city, who was ah of

A large crowd gathered about the wreck
and twelve minutes later a second run
away car came tearing down the hill and
plowed into the crowd with death-deal

car struck a carriage containing James
Brown and Lizzie Minner, on their way to
McKeesport to be married. The carriage
was completely wrecked and' the driver,
Alexander Sanders, was fatally hurt. The
young couple escaped with comparatively
slight injuries and later were married.
A blinding sleet storm prevailed at the
time and, it is said, the two cars "skated"
down the hill with brakes tightly set.
The accident happened at the foot of
Long Hill, runing into Wilmerding from
McKeesport. A car without passengers
got beyond the control of the motorman
and dashed down the hill, one and a quar

"That boy over there," exclaimed Coons,
pointing to a child named Claude Altman.
whom he is accused of having abused,
â¢'hasn't got any devils in him because ho
is too small. If 'he was a little bigger,
though, he would have them."
But on the subject of evil spirits and
little devils Coons demonstrated that he
is altogether crazy. He said that it is
within his power to distinguish devils in
children as soon as he see them and that
he can drive them away by pounding their
bodies with his fists.
At the examination Coons was first per
mitted to tell all about himself. On the
events of his past life his memory was
clear enough. Judge Ogden and the ex
amining physicians, Drs. J. L. Miton and
Myra Knux, succeeded in drawing out the
history of his life from his boyhood until
the present. His troubles seemed to have
begun after he married his second wife,
in 1890. He had trouble with her and
claims that it led to his being put in the
insane- asylum at Utlca, N. xv, where he
was then living. He came jo California
then and in 1893 was committed to Ukiah,
having become afflicted with religious
mania. He stayed there three months and
has since been living in Oakland.
The insane delusion entertained by Ed
ward L. Coons that he is commissioned
to drive evil spirits out of the bodies of
every child he meets convinces the police
department that he is the man Â»vho at
tacked and bound little Flossie White.
Testimony offered before Judge Ogden to
day, when Coons was examined on a
charge of insanity, bears out this theory
as to the identity of the man who has
been so long sought. On the strength of
the stories of witnesses and Coons' own
admissions that he has attacked children
Judge Ogden decided that the safest place
for him is the State hospital at Uklah,
to which institution he committed the
patient.

years the buildings in which the poor and

The land is near the town of Shasta.
The county hospital was recently moved
from Shasta, to, a .point near Redding.
The eighty acres of land comprising the
old site was considered almost worthless
and was sold 'to four men for. $600. Cor

purchasers.

quartz claim" on the. property. At a depth
of sixty feet a drift was started to cross
cut the iMlge. After running twenty feet
an ore boay was tapped to-day. The rock
is richiin free gold, easily discernible to
the naked eye. The pay shoot is three
feet in width, although the ledge has an
extreme width of fifteen feet. - Conserva
tive miners estimate the value of the ore
which glistens across the face of the pay
shoot to average $300 a ton.

Gold Strike Near Redding.
-SEATTLE, Jan. 29.â Unless the claims
of somo of the miners who are now tn
the country to secure* locations are much
exaggerated the coming, spring promises*
to bring from Alaska news of a new
placer gold strike of considerable im
portance. The discovery of the Inoko
gold fields was made by a party of pros
pectors who, on their way out from the
KjUskokwim a year ago, lost their way
and wandered on to the Inoko, where
they spent the remaining portion of the
winter. In the spring they did a little
prospecting, sufficient, according to the
reports, to convince them that the ground
was extraordinarily rich â after .which
they came on out- of the country- for, a
supply of provisions and equipment' for
working their newly discovered claims.
News- of the find reached Nome late
this season and at least three parties left
that place to go to the scene of the dis
covery. One of these consisted of four
men, H. R. Henderson and R. H. Hen
derson of San Francisco and J. Cunning
ham and Charles McDow. of this' city.
According to their Information the dis
coverers of the new diggings took out
57000 in dust and nuggets, in a few days.
One of the discoverers was a man anmed
Ferguson, who came from Oregon. The
gold was in dust and in gold-bearing cop
per quartz.
The men claimed that, according to re
liable information, the new diggings were
so rich that a man could easily take out
upward of $15 a day. .The Hendersons in
vested $4000 in' their outfit' and another
party, outfitted by two saloon keepers at
Nome, purchased the small steamer Los
Angeles and - started . a party of sixteen
men for the new discoveries.

The conglomerate deposit so far. located
is "eight miles long and from one and a
quarter to four miles wide. Its thickness
is unknown as yet, as'rio sinking has been
done, but the fissuring of the mass shows
500 feet. This fissure traverses the con
glomerates from the northwest to south
east. One side has subsided, leaving the
other precipitous, and at the base of the
precipice no indications of a change of
structure are observable. There seems no
doubt that the Indian River Valley was
at one time 400. or 500 feet higher than at
present and that its old channel has been
depressed by erosion or by some sudden
convulsion of nature. to its present level
Every portion of this immense mass of
quartz conglomerate, is gold '. bearing.
Colors are found everywhere and j free,
gold in specks and. good sized nuggets are
of freauent occurrence.' ' . '
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 29.-Reports
from mining engineers and reliable'miners
of Dawson tell of the discovery of quartz
conglomerates on Indian River, twenty
eight miles from Dawson, the immensity
and phenomenal wealth of which it is dif
ficult to grasp. Indian River and its trib
utary creeks were thoroughly prospected
for placer gbld in the early days* of the
Klondike rush. Recently/the nature of
the placer material on these creeks at
tracted the attention of miners who had
worked in .the South African gold neids
and they were struck with its similarity
to the rich "blanket" deposits of the
Rand. They carried ' their investigations
further, to the neighboring benches, and
discovered that the 'escarpments of the
Indian River Valley were composed of
immense masses of conglomerates, iden
tical in composition with " those c which
have yielded so many millions of treasure
in. South Africa. A superficial prospect
of deposits satisfied the miners that they
were gold bearing, and subsequent exam
inations at various points revealed the
fact that they carried from $100 'to ?200 in
gold to the ton. '

' CANTON, Ohio, - Jan. 29.â The people ot
this city/paid ,* tribute' to the late. President
McKinley. , in a memorial, service at "the
Tabernacle ; to-night. It waa paritidpaied
1JV by- persons in ' all walks â¢ of * Uf e! : : ' to a
number that taxed the big \ inclosure,
where many of the same - people had - so,
often listened to the. words "of their old

The correspondent says the Dutch Gov
ernment expressly announced In this note
that it possesses no authorization whatso
ever from the Boer leaders, either in Eu
rope or South Africa,' to take this sug
gested step, but that it appeals to Great
Britain on the ground of common human
ity, for military permission for the Dutch,
commission to accomplish Its mission or
peace.
PARIS, Jan. 30.-1* Patrio this morning
publishes an interview '.with Dr. Leyds.
who denies that the representatives of
the South African republics in Europe
asked for the mediation of Holland in
South African affairs, or authorized Dr.
Kuyper, the Dutch Premier, to make
propositions for peace.
"There can be no conditions for the
British Government to examine," said
Dr. Leyds. "There is only one condition:
the British Government knows it suf
ficiently well and need not examine It fur
ther. From the intentional ambiguity of
Air. Balfour's statement in the House of
Commons it is evident that this is mere
maneuver."
The German Cabinet is maintaining, an
absolute neutral attitude, and will not
concern itself with any thing that has the
appearance of meddling in this matter.
LONDON, Jan. 30.â The- Hague corre
spondent of the Daily Mail says ho is abla
to announce on authority tnat tha Dutch,
note to Great Britain, after rehearsing
the great concern of that Government at
the prolongation of hostilities in South
Africa; offered its good offices in bringing
them to a close.' To this end Holland
asked whether Great Britain would be
willing to permit a Dutch commission to
proceed to South Africa to enlighten the
Boer leaders in 'the field as to the real
position of affairs and more especially
since It 13 understood that there Is hot
the slightest chance of intervention on the
part of any European power and that tbe
prolongation of hostilities is useless, if
the brave struggle .can servo no further
good purpose.
BERLIN, Jan. 23.â The statement ema
nating from Paris that the powers were
privy to the proposals of Dr. Kuyper, the
Dutch. Premier, to Great Britain on tha
subject of peace- in South Africa, and ap
proved this step beforehand, Is denied
without reservation here in so far aa the
German Government is concerned.
The Boer delegates disclaim any knowl
edge of the contents of the Dutch, note to
Great Britain. '
THE HAGUE, Jan. 23.r-In, the First
Chamber of [States-General to-day the
Premier, Dr.\ Kuyper, replying to a. ques
tion on the subject, confirmed the accur
acy of A. J. Balfour's statement in the
British. House of- Commons yesterday re
garding the Dutch Government'3 offer to
help In bringing about peace in South
Africa, but the Premier added that he
was prevented by courtesy from disclos
ing'any details concerning the note so
long aa the British Government had not
published its contents, or until a reply
to it was received.
Yesterday morning Deputy Sheriff
Bache, who was to tako Matteo to Ag
news, went up to the cell and found him
unconscious. City Physician Laspada
was called, but the old man never re
gained consciousness and died about 11
o'clocn this morning.
An examination of the body this even
ing showed a wound on the top of the
head, which is undoubtedly a fracture of
the skull and which was the cause * of
death.
County officials are Â«ritlclzed for not
having provided a padded cell for insane
persons, the Sheriff having repeatedly pe
titioned for such an apartment.
Matteo, who was 50 years of age, was.
arrested last Friday by Deputy Constable
Castro for stealing lumber from. W. C.
Krieg. He was charged with petty j lar
ceuy, and was' to have, been tried for the
crime to-morrow. He was. a "sour wine
llend," and when arrested was intoxicat
ed. On Saturday night he became wild
with either delirium, tremeris or insanity.
He hurled. himself against the cell in the
big tank, and when two cellmates inter
fered he attacked .them. Finally Jailer
Dreischmeyer had \o remove the others
from the cell to quiet him.
"When Matteo was bathed on Sunday
it was found that his arms and^ body
were bruised and there was clotted blood
on his head. I Symptoms of insanity de
veloped quickly and after examination
Drs. Bangs and Simpson signed a com
mitment to Acmews.
. SAX JOSE. Jan. 29.â Trobolto Matteo,
an insane patient who was committed to
Agnews Insane Asylum on Monday, died
in the County Jail to-day from the effects
of hurling himself head foremost? against
the brick wall of his cell.

"A Mr.n of Mystery" is mystifying the
Central audiences this week, much to their
pleasure. It is a stirring melodrama of
love and mystery, and blood and thunder,
that is very well done by the Central
company and very well staged by the Cen
tral management. "Master and Man"
comes next week.
Madame ICor<lica suffered throughout this
Â«"vcnJnÂ« from the effects of the hard ft rain of
the patt few days and the shaking up re
â¢ â¢â¢. i -."Â»Â¦ d '.a a railroad accident in Alabama a
short time ago. Notwithstanding this fact her
voice tras perfect. To-night she canceled all
pngagemeats for the next week or ten days,
as she oust have absolute rest and quiet. The
singer is in the hands of a physician.
The following telegram was received
last night from Santa Barbara announc
ing that the Kordica song recitals dated
for the coming week will be deferred until
further notice:
"Coralie and Company" Is serving to
amuse Alcazar audiences. It is more fun
ny than vulgar, but has some ingenuity
of construction and some clever and in
genious mecRanical devices in its setting.
The company is much better than ' the
play, and skims over its risque situations
with admirable lightness of touch. Juliet
Crosby does particularly good work in her
role, and Margaret Wycherly, Oza "VVal
drop, Marie Howe. M. L. Alsop. "Frank
Bacon and George Osbourne all do clever
work. . Next week "The Danites" will be
put on.
"Ole Olsen," the evergreen Swedish play,
is attracting good houses at the Califor
nia. Ben Hendricks, who is seen in the
title role, was the first and is still the
test actor of Swedish parts, and he is] well
supported by his company. The Swedish
Ladies' Quartet is a very attractive feat
ure of the bill, furnishing some exceed
ingly pretty numbers. J
The next play at. this house, to make Its
first apoearance in San Francisco on Sun
dav night, is "The Pride of Jennico,"- the
romantic drama in which James K. Hack
ett found so much fame.
Edwin Arden's melodrama Zorah. k
pleasing large audiences at the Grand
o^fra-hWe. Mr. Arden has an jmpres
*ive part as a venerable Jewish rabbi and
lAura Nelson Hall makes a strong and
pleasing impression in the > title role
Others in the cast are Mr. and Mrs. Gard
ner Crane, who make their first appear
ance this week at the Grand Opera-house;
Herechel ilajall. Fred J. Butler and Burr
CarruUi.
"The Ameer" at the Tivoll is one of the
best things the little opera-house has put
on. Ferris Hartman in the title role is
tjicruciatingly funny, Harry Cashman
comes a pood second as Heezaburd. Fran
ces Graham as Mirzah has made a very
t,ood impression and Anna Liehtcr sings
the part ef Constance with all her old
time sweetness. Annie Myers is happily
cast as the maid of Constance and has
borne very pretty songs. The new tenor.
Harold Gordon, has established himself
iis a first favorite with the Tivoli clientele
and supplied a long-felt want in the com
pany. Arthur Cunningham's brigand is a
splendid effort and "Webb does well, but
might do better, as the court fool. lfie
Ame*r" is good for a long run.
One of the most important attractions
of the season follows. Viola Alien in her
r.ew play. "In the Palace of tho King/' a
oramatization of F. Marion Crawford's
novel of the name, by LÂ«orimer Stoddard.
Miss Allen vrill be supported by an ex
cellent company and the- settings of thÂ«
i ".ay are said to be of the most sumptuous
order.
"The Princess Chic" Is in its last days
at the Columbia Theater and the pretty
opera has met with the success it fully
merits. Miss Bcrri has proved her place
iimong comic opera artists a very high
one and her supporting company is un
usually competent.

On- this point the petition says that. the
Secretary of the Navy was in error in
stating that the court excluded testimony
to show that, as Dewey said, Schley was
the . senior officer â¢ in the battle of San
tiagoâwas In absolute command and en
titled, to: the credit due for the glorious
Victory which resulted in the total de
struction of the Spanish ships.
Luncheon at "the Pendennis Club fol
lowed, and to-night the admiral, was the
guest of honor at the annual dinner of
the: Board of .Trade at the Gait House.
He responded with a bow to the cheers
that greeted - his : entry to the 'banquet
room. â¢;- The room was flower-laden, i Ad
mirar Schley, Governor Beckham, Gen
eral Catchings and others spoke. . - Â¦
" "WASHINGTON. Jan. 29.â The Navy De
partment has made public Admiral
Schley's' appeal,- delivered to the Presi
dent about a week ago. The department's
"comment" â¢ will be published in a day or
.two. Admiral Schley appeals to the Pres
ident as the chief executive and com
mander in chief of the ; army and navy,
"vested with power to regulate and direct
the acts of the several executive officers
thereof,", and he asks that the President
review the findings of the court." He asks
this on three grounds, in each case basing
his appeal on . the Â¦ findings of Admiral
Dewey as opposed to the majority report.
These â¢ three grounds are set out com
pendiously in the "petition," which flll3
about eight printed pages of a pamphlet
and is signed â¢ by Admiral Schley and by
Raynor, Parker and Teague of his coun
sel. Attached , to the' petition are three
exhibits, each made up of copious extracts
from the testimony taken by the court of
inquiry and intended to confirm the state
ments of fact made In the petition itself.
In this latter document the first ground
of appeal Is the holding of Secretary Long
In his indorsement on the court's findings
that "the conduct of the court In making
no finding and rendering no opinion on
those questions (that of command and of
credit for. the victory) is approvedâ Indeed,
it- could with propriety take no', other
course, evidence on these questions during
the inquiry having been excluded by the
court." . .

The annual meeting 1 of the General Ger
man La-dies' Benevolent Society was held
at S60 Geary street yesterday. -There was
a large attendance and considerable In
terest in the operations of the society,
Â¦which are increasing in scope. from, year
to year, was manifested.
- The relief work of the society Is con
fined principally to the carÂ© of helpless
widows and orphans. During the past
twelve months over 1400 cases of suffering
among destitute fatherless families were
looked after by the officers of the society
and needed help furnished. In 1900 more
than 1300 cases of destitution were caxed
President Mrs. C. Koester read her an
nual report; in which she called atten
tion to the good work done by the so
ciety during the past year. The
ship now numbers 253, -of which 21o are
paying members, five honorary members
and thirty-three life members. Among
the members are many of the best known
German residents of San Francisco, all of.
whom are actively engaged in prosecut
ing the work of the organization. /The
president urged that every woman now
identified with the society should. do all in
her . power . to increase the membership
during the current year.
Mrs. Louisa D. Plagemann. the treas
urer, reported that the total receipts dur
ing the year aggregated $4378. Of that
sum $2579 represented dues paid by the
members and $595 was donated by charit
able persons. The sum of $3543 was dis
bursed, in charity. The cash on hand
amounts to J7676. l
After the consideration of the annual
reports the election of officers for the en
suing term, was entered upon with the fol
lowing results, the old officers being
unanimously re-elected:
President. "Mrs. C. Koester; vice president.
Mrs. C. 1 Regensburger: secretary. ' Mrs. F.
Fehlelser; treasurer, Mrs. Louisa. D. Plage
mann. .
The board. of directors Is composed of
the officers named and ten others, five of
whom hold over, while five are elected
every year. Those elected were:
Mrs. M. Esberg. Mrs. L. Goettig, Mrs. J. C.
Meussdorffer, Mrs. B. Broemmel and Mrs.
Isaac Hecht. The hold-over directors are Mrs.
F. Habenlcht. Mrs. M. A. Buck. Mrs. H.
Kreutzmann. Mrs. F. Stadtmueller and Mrs.
L. Lebenbaum.
The present advisory committee, con
sisting of R. Cappelle. F. Habemicht and
Charles J. Simon, was rcappointed.
During the afternoon a general discus
sion of the affairs of the society was in
dulged in and- plans Were advanced for
increasing the efficiency of the society a
work. The members were urged to do all
In their power to secure new members, as
the receipts- will be enhanced thereby.
While the society has in no sense been
seriously hampered by a lack of funds. Its
operations have of necessity been confined
to a restricted field, on that account. The
society has in the past years received sev
eral bequests from estates, but these were
merely nominal sums. The Idea was ex
pressed that if more people of wealth were
to remember the society in their wills the
cause of charity in aid of widows and
orphans would be materially advanced.

The. Board of Supervisors held a special
meeting last night for the purpose of
hearing the offer of Russell L. Dunn and
William C. Alberger to sell to the city the
Giant Gap water supply, from the north
fork of the 'American River. The meet
ing.was in. the nature of an investigation
of the merits of the supply, which the
Board of Works reported as inadequate
for the needs of the city.
. Attorney Frank H. Gould presented the
claims of the Giant Gap supply, which,
he said, was better for the city than the
Tuolumne River project, recommended by
the-Board of, Works. Gould was followed
by Russell .Dunn, the engineer of the
Giant Gap supply, who stated that one
reservoir' already built was capable of
supplying this city after it had doubled in
population. The title to the supply Is clear
and includes 70,000 acres of land. The
pipe to'be used would be of steer and five
thirty-seconds , of ,an inch in thickness,
though.. In' some places .the pipe would
have to be three-sixteenths of an inch
thick. ~ / ,". Â¦ ..'.;-;
City Engineer Grunsky declared that no
reliable, engineer would : have planned .to
use the thickness of the pipe as decided
upon by Engineer Dunn, as the thickness
would not. stand- the pressure.
In reply to a question -of Mayor Schmitz,
Dunn stated that the pipe if made of steel
would last twenty years, and, would have
to be replaced at the end of that time.
The board adjourned without -taking
any action regarding the offer.

"Do you want "to examine my foot?"
She finally admitted that in the event
of success attending Unruh in the suit
to recover the Blythe property she was to
be clothed, fed and maintained by Bald-
Win for the rest of her life. She also ad
mitted that she did not commence divorce
proceedings asainst Barnstadt until she
had gone to the ranch near Los Angeles.
She admitted also that Miss Dickey, the
nurse, who accompanies her to the court
room every day, is in the employ of
Baldwin.
Attorney Moore questioned the witness
very closely about an agreement made in
writing between Baldwin and herself and
she grew decidedly nervous. When he
asked her where the paper was, she
straightened up in her chair, shoved her
foot out and asked the attorney:
remember whether she ever complained to
her former husband. Barnstadt. whose
name ehe forgot. Also that all she got to
drink was one pint of sour claret a day.
"What hÂ«s Baldwin promised you in case
Unruh is successful in this suit?" was asked.
"I have been promised a home."
"He. Baldwin, will furnish you with a good
<ieal more than a. home, will he not?"
"I wfll have to look up law matters before
I answer that question."
"How much money are you to net?"
"Whenever I ask lor it I get whatever I
Â¦want."
The witness then said that she did not
At this point Alice Edith - Dickason I
showed that she was still possessed of the
epirit -â¢ -which has - enabled hex .to live
through enough trouble to kill an ordinary
Â¦woman. She turned to Judge and
said sharply:
I don't *ee what they are prying into ray i
private affairs for. It is none ot their busi- ;
ness. . r j
Judge Hunt directed her to answer the
question, but she evaded ' the issue by j
almost whispering, "I don't remember."
Up to yesttrday morning she had only
been questioned concerning her life dur
ing the lifetime of Blythe, but yesterday
she was Interrogated about her life dur
ing the last two years. Her unwilling
answers created a stir:
â¢â¢Where have you been living for the last
S-ear and & ha'.f and Elnce the commencement
of this suit?' was asked.
"At Baldwin' s house at the Santa Anita
Ranch." the replied. ' .
"Whom have you been supported by during
that x>eriod?"
"Mr. Baldwin."
"During that time you have not been per
mitted to leave the ranch except at stated in
tervals?"
"I could go where I wanted and whenever I
pleased. I had a horse and buggy and drove
to Los Angples when I liked."
â¢â¢But you were under surveillance all tbe
time, were you -not?" ?
'"1 do not know thai I was."
' "Have you not made complaint that you
were not given proper lood and drink?"
Alice Edith Dickason spent an uncom
fortable morning in Judge Hunt's cour,t
yesterday. She lost her temper several
times and appealed to the court In her ef
forts to evade answering the questions
of Attorney Moore, but she was directed
to answer. According to her testimony
she is now a protege of "Lucky" Bald
win and in the event of Unruh winning
the suit being tried she is to be clothed,
fed and maintained at the expense of the
millionaire for the rest of her life.
. Mrs. Preitz being confined at this time, I
thought I would write a letter to Mr. Luhn, as
he was acquainted .with my writing and . did
not seem to know hers. I received an answer
and was on the point of handing this to her
husband -who happened "to go to the postoffice
at Calistoga with me, but I asked him first
what he would do to his wife. He said. ."T
would sell all my goods and leave her." This
did not. suit me, as we did not want her on our
hands, and I kept my letter. I wrote one more
letter and Mrs. Preitz entered the room when
I finished it. I handed it to her and told her
that this was the last one I would write, as
I now had all the information I wanted: We
were at all times when alone discussing the
letters and answers to Mr. Luhn, and I often
asked her what to write or to answer to such
questions of his. We were on good terms dur
ing this whole time. Mrs. Preitz was not re
ceiving any letters from the Calistoga post
office at that time.
DEIDRICH VOX DUERIXG.
I, .D. von Duering, being first duly sworn;
depose and say that I am a resident of Lark
mead, Napa County, Cal.. and have been such
for seventeen years; .that I know Mrs. Robert
Preitz for over one year and that at her re
quest I wrote several letters to a Mr. Luhn in
St. Louis, to which the answer was - addressed
to a fictitious name in -St. Helena, Â¦ and that
we went together to the postofflce and called
for and received those letters, and that Mrs.
Preitz handed them back to me for safe-keep
ing; that I then told her not to have the same
letters come to St. Â¦ Helena, as the clerks would
remember the name and place those letters In
my box. "Bat why not send them, to Calls
toga in your name?" I suggested,
and â¢ Mrs. Â¦ 'Preitz - said . it would bis
the best. As by this time I was pos
itive that there was something crooked about
her relations with Mr. Luhn I took occasion tc
ask . her husband what he would do to find
these things out. He answered, "I will give a
thousand dollars to such a person."
Dear Mrs. Preitz: I received your letter
and was not at all excited over it. I have
shown every letter to my wire, knowing that
they were written by a man. That your
brother-in-law should think me sneh a cow
surprises me. . I know you never write correct
German for, you never speak correct Ger
man.- With best regards from my wife and
myself. Â¦ WALTER LUHN.
Von Duering has sworn to the following
affidavit, in his defense:
Â¦ 'Dietrich von Duering, a.resfdent of
Â¦Larkmead, Napa County, was arrested at
the Calistoga postoffice 1 last Tuesday by
Postofflce Inspector Coyne on the charge
Â¦of opening letters addressed to Mrs. Rob
ert fr el tz, and all Calistoga's tongues are
wagging over the scandal developed by
the arrest. Von Duering furnished bonds
in the! sum of $1000 and was allowed to go
home. . . - . '*.. J
It is a case of Othello andrlago mod
ernized In some of its features. Airs.
â¢Preitz is the wife of Mrs. von Duering s
brother. The statement of Mrs. Preitz is
,to . the effect that Von Duering, without
'her. knowledge, has been writing letters in
her name to Waiter Luhn, an employe ot
J.'G. Westerheiae & Co., music dealers, at
St. Louis, and receiving the replies whicn
were addressed to Mr3. Preitz. Von Duer
ing intimates that Mrs. Preitz was in love
'with Luhn and that he wrote the letters
at her request and brought the replies to
her at her dictation. Von iiuering's afli
davit shows that . Mrs. Preitz's husband
was willing to pay *1000 for proof of her
infidelity.
Mrs. Preitz's story is that she and Rob
ert Preitz were married in New YorK,
May 21, 1899. and that on the following
November he left New York to take a po
sition'as steward on board the transport
Meade. He suggested that she should take
a trip to Germany and meet him at San
Francisco on his return from Manila- On
the return voyage to New YorK she made
the acquaintance of Mr. and Mrs. Luhn,
and she traveled with the Luhns as far
as St. Louis, stopping over a short time
in that city to wait for the. train that was
to take her to California. W hen she ar
hived in this city her husband took her
to Larkmead, six miles from St. Helena,
to the Von Duerings, with whom she was
to make her home. She told her husband
of the kindnesses she had received at the
hands of the Luhns, and at ner request
her husband wrote to Luhn thanking him.
"I left the letter on my dresser," con
tinues Mrs. .Preitz in her statement to
Postofflce Inspector. Coyne, "and Von
Duering found it, and then commenced to
correspond with Luhn without my knowl
edge." : . Â¦. ; . .
The letters were of an amatory nature,
but the replies sent to Mrs. .Preitz were
not much more than friendly. Finally she
discovered. one' of the letters in Von Duer
ing's possession, and wrote to Luhn advis
ing him of the fact that she. had not been
writing to him.a.t all. | In reply to the let
ter of warning Luhn wrote as follows:

. Mrs. Normile was entirely unconscious
that anything had happened to her hus

early in the morning to go to work at
' During his spree with' Mrs. Allsted "and
the Vasseys Normile masqueraded under
the- name of Tom Burke. Neither the
Vasseys nor Mrs. Allsted knew his . true
name. When the Morgue officials ar
rived on the scene his identity was es
tablished by the ' linding of a Building
Trades Council membership card in his
pocket. The card indicated that he be
longed to the Hod Carriers' Union. Then
came the most painful task of all. Nor
mile's wife and her eight little children
reside at 3274 Folsom street. They had
heard nothing about the tragedy. In
order to make the identification more
complete the officers went to the Nor
mile home. They found the wife sitting
up. awaiting the arrival of Â¦ her husband.
Leaves Eight Little Children.
Ghastly Sight on Hillside. z
After Ncrmile and' Mrs. Alisted had
been turned away the Vasseys went to
bed to Sleep off the effects of the wine.
So soundly d'.d they sleep .that they did
not hear the shot. They remained asleep
until Officer C. VVJ Brown and Sergeant
C\ V. Blank arrived and aroused them
by knocking on the door. Vassey ana hl.s
wife, who are both rather infirm and deaf.
bore evidence of having taken part Â»n a
carousal. Both were unkempt and there
was an empty claret jug under the table.
Allsted lives at 51 Hohy Park and at the
time of the shooting claims to have been
on his -way to visit a. house which he owns
on Mcntcalm street. After flring the shot
that ended Normiie's life, he ran to the
home of Dennis Foley, one of the neigh
bors, and requested him to come up the
hill as he had something to show him.
Koley a<-compa-nied the murderer and
found Normile's body still resting across
Mrs. Allsted's lower limbs, the woman
being in a sitting position and too. full of
liquor to rise. With the help of Foley,
Allsted got his wife to a standing position.
Koley dispatched his son to call the
police. When' the officers arrived on the
scene they placed both Allsted and his
wife under arrest and removed them to
the Seventeenth-street station. Both were
loath to talk about the crime. Mrs. All
sted was still under the influence of liquor
when she reached the station, and' acting
under instructions from her husband, re
fused to talk. Allsted is about 60 years of
age, while his wife is several years
younger. He was charged with murder.
The murder was the termination of an
all-day carousal. Normile and Mrs. All
sted had met in the morning at the home
of Harry Vassey, a mutual friend, who
lives on Bernai Heights. During the
day and until late in the afternoon they
diank claret with Vassey and his wife,
ana had what they itemed an enjoyable
time. When Normile and Mrs. Allsted
took their departure late in the afternoon
both were very drunk. '
When the two left Vassey' s house they
intended to go to their homes, but changed
their minds and returned. Vassey. wno
was himself intoxicated by this time, re
fused to admit them agam. so they went
out and sat down on the hills.de. not more
than forty feet from "Vassey's* door. Here
they were seated ' when' Allsted arrived
with a nrie and shot Normile.
and instantly killed last night on
the north side of Bernal Heights by Gus
tav Allsted. another laborer. The mur
der was caused by Allsted finding Nor
mile on the hillside in the company of
his wife. The bullet, which was fired
from a rifle of a very small caliber, en
tered Normile's head just behind the car
and penetrating upward through the
brain passed out through the top of the
skull. After being shot Normile fell
