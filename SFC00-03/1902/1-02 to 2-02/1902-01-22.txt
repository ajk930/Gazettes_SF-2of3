Special Dispatch to The Call.
Confidence is expressed at the Navy
Department that the President will sup
port the action of Secretary Long. This
means he Trill not, in the opinion of na
val officials, give Schley credit for the
victory at Santiago. Friends of the Pres
ident say he has conceived a way to set
tle the controversy. This is not, it is
caid, in conflict with the action of Sec
retary Long. Even Rear Admiral
Echley's friends predict that the action
the President will take will be adverse,
and they regret the appeal was made.
Those who are pushing Rear Admiral
Schley forward as a Presidential possi
bility, say. however, It Is a movement
that is sure to redound to the benefit of
the naval officer, especially as It will
ehow the country that President Roose
velt is in the "clique" to besmirch their
hero.
Rear Admiral Schley's appeal proper
contains about 2000 words. There are
three exhibits setting forth the testimony
vhlch it is claimed the court failed to
consider. The document follows closely
the bill of exceptions filed by the rear
admiral with. Secretary Long before the
latter approved the -findings of the court
and disapproved the individual opinion
expressed by Admiral Dewey. It con
tends that the evidence given vindicates
Rear Admiral Schley of every one of the
charges made against him.
President Roosevelt, however, has de
cided not to make the appeal public at
this time. It is his purpose to devote his
tpare moments to its consideration. The
Attorney General will be furnished with
a copy and he will also read It. Knox
has already read .the testimony adduced
by the court. He is, therefore, in a po
sition to promptly dispose of Rear Ad
miral Schley's brief. The President is
also primed with facts and the moment
lie hears from Knox that moment he will
be prepared to act.
Rear Admiral Schley met his counsel,
Rayner and Teague, at the Hotel Rich
mond this morning. The latter submitted
to him the brief they had prepared,
which contains about 35.000 words. Rear
Admiral Schley expressed gratification
with the presentation it made of his case
iEind attached his signature to the docu
ment. It was intrusted to M. A. Teague,
one cf the rear admiral's counsel, who
carried it to the White House ana hand
ed it to Secretary Cortelyou for submis
sion to the President. The rear admiral
was asked if he could state the salient
points of his appeal. ;--* ,

that John D. Rockefeller is. the principal

poration.
The day following the filing of its char
ter in the Secretary of State's office here
the corporation purchased fourteen acres
of land situated in the very heart of the
proved oil district of Spindle Heights. The
consideration is said to have exceeded
$3,000,000. The capital stock of the com
pany is fixed at a nominal figure, al
tnough Its sole purpose calls for the ex
penditure of many millions of dollars In

The Minister recalled France's' ' recent
enthusiastic -welcome to the Czar; who
was then enabled to see the daily increas
ing support which the French army and
navy could give the allianceA The results
achieved, said M. Delcasse in conclusion,
were due to the constant support Par
liament had given the Government. The
Foreign Minister's statement was greeted
with prolonged applause. The Chamber
then proceeded: to discuss the various
clauses of the estimates, several of which
were adopted. After a spirited debate on
the subiect the Chamber, on the demand
of M. Delcasse. decided to maintain the
appropriation for the French embassy to
the Vatican by a vote of 341 to 206. This
appropriation had been suppressed by the
budget committee. The Chamber then ad
journed.
Regarding various questions raised by
M. Etienne". M. Delcasse replied that the
Government w*9 closely, -watching all
French interests. He spoke of the Franco-
Italian agreement on the North 'African
question; which had led to a complete, un
derstanding between the two powers, and
said that the relations of France with the
United States had become more friendly.
The Foreign. Minister also alluded to the
Franco-Russian alliance, which -was : the
result of perfect accord between ih.e in
terests- of France and Russia. Â¦
France and the Czar.
Replsing to questions, the Foreign Min
ister. M. Delcasse, said France's position
in the world was satisfactory. He recalled
the signing' of the Chinese protocol, which
was to the honor of France, for France
succeeded in inspiring confidence among
the powers and in creating accord.
France's position in Turkey was second
to that of no other power. M. Delcasse
recalled the success of the Government's
recent action toward Turkey, which he
aald had, completely restored French in
fluence. ; ' .
It is said that M. Deschanel, the Presi
dent of the Chamber, has decided to in
tervene and end the incident, and that he
has ordered the words of M. d'Estour
nelles de Constant to be suppressed from
the report tot the sitting.
M. Secours (Republican) asked the For
eign Minister, M. Delcasse, tor put a stop
to the threats against the French estab
lishments on the French shore of New
foundland. M. Etienne (Republican)
made a. long speech, urging a more vig
orous defense of French interests where
they came in contact with those of Great
Britain. He called attention to the ef
forts of Great Britain to supplant French
influence on the Niger and in Abyssinia,
Morocco. Siam and the New Hebrides.
France, he said, ought to closely watch
the Persian Gulf. ': '
Intervention by Deschanel.
PARIS, Jan. 21.â During the debate on
the foreign estimates in the Chamber of
Deputies to-day Count Boni de Castellane
(Republican) asked for explanations of
the Government's policy. He complained
that the French policy In China gave
cause to doubt whether France had a
comprehensive plan of foreign policy, as
in the case oi Russia, uermany and
Creat Britain. The Deputy added that
he would like to see imperialism exist in
France as it did in Great Britain, Ger
many and the United States.
M d'-Kstournelles ae Constant (Repub
lican) condemned the increase in arma
ment and the expansion policy, which, he
raid, multiplied the chances of conflicts
and would lead to a frightful crash. He
regretted that France Had entered into
an imperialistic policy in acquiescing to
tne Europeanization of China.
AL Lastes (.anti-Semite) having inter
pellated a sarcastic remark, M. d'Estour
nelles de Constant retorted that he would
not be intimidated by Nationalists. The
remark offended M. Lasies, who sent sec
onds to M. d'Estournelles de Constant.
The seconds of M- d'Estournelles de
Constant and M. Lasies failed to agree

Deputy constituted an insult. The sec
onds referred the question to arbitrators,

After much argument and repartee the
court ruled that the petition was Insuffi

and according to law, it would be heard.
Both Raker and Spencer protested

route which will receive . consideration:
Opponents of .Nicaragua say the Panama
route can be- selected with $5,000,000 less
cost and maintained at an expense of
51,300,000 a year less than the Nicaragua
route. "Now it is asserted that Colombia
is disposed to demand an annual rental of
$1,500,UOO for the right of way along trw
Panama^ route, .whereas the Nicaragua
route is free. ; Friends, of the Hepburn
bill point to these figures and say that
instead of being the cheaper route, Pana
ma would mean an expenditure of $200,
000 more a year after the canal is built.
The canal, they declare, is a work for
Â«l e^.Â« and ln twe "ty-nvp years the J200,
000 difference would save J5.000.000, which,
it is alleged, can be cut off by selecting
the Panama route, and after -twenty-five
years the Government would save $200,
000 a year on the figures furnished.
But indefinite- delay is still declared to
be the chief move of. those, who urge the
Panama route, and here comes a little poli
tics. . It is said the Democrats will stand
firm for Nicaragua. to prevent agreement
on Panama, so that the session will come
to an end without a canal law. Then they
can go Into the Congressional campaign
next summer and charge the Republican
party with defeating or delaying canal
legislation in the Interest, of transconti
nental railroads. *Â¦-'

OF. BEPITBLICAN' CLJ7BS
-Mrs. Gibbins' testimony was given -with
a certain amount of clearness, but she
contradicted hjersell.on several points and
her memory failed her at times when it
apparently should. have been clearer. :
Mrs. Gibbins said she saw- the masked
men' clearly, â¢Â¦ but could not approximate
the number' in the mob. She did not go
downstairs that night, but , went to bed
and arose at her usual hour in the morn
ing. She did not see Samuel Parks any
more that night.' -'â¢ Â¦ -. Â¦Â¦Â¦ . , Â¦
it was. a. bright moonlight night, 'and saw
them return to the hotel.. \ â¢ .;â¢ -.'..
. v Three-Cornered Repartee.
Here Raker asked Mrs. Gibbins if John
Hutton was not in the habit of <playing
"tag" with small children. An objection
was sustained. .< ,
Spencerâ We want to show the mental call
1jer of. Hutton. . . =. .
; Post â Fools and children epeak the truth.-
Haker, sarcastically â The leader of the mob
was playing- with children.
.Post â Some of your .friends led the mob.
Raker â Don't you gag that down my throat.
I'll not stand it. Am I to stand here to be
hurt in that way, your Honor? ' -
The Judge â God bless your sweet little life,
Johnnie Raker, nobody wanted to hurt. you. â¢
This ended the direct examination and
Post took up the cross-examination. In
answer to his questions, Mrs. c.-^xns said
that the only reason she knew that Parks;
Erving Carpenter and Supervisor Dennis
Kane slept in the house that night waa
that she knew that they had been as
signed to certain rooms. . She said that
she was not frightened by what trans
pired downstairs; that her sister was at
tacked by a nervous spell in their moth
er's room, but made no noise. . - :
Mrs. Gibbins' mother has testified, that
her two daughters made a great disturb
ance. . â¢:Â¦-.â¢. â¢>.- . . . , V Â¦;
Raker asked Mrs. Gibbins it Â¦ she had
ever, previous to the lynching, heard De
fendant Brown or other alleged members
of the mob talk of the lynching. â¢ She was
allowed to' say that,, she had never heard
her. father; speak of a possible lynching.
She said; that on the night of the tragedy
her father, went to bed before she retired.
She and her sister were awakened in the
middle of the night by. the tramping of
feet and went to .their mother's room.
They believed the prisoners were trying to
escape. Her father went downstairs. > Â¦
â¢The prosecution objected to the method
of Interrogation adopted / by Raker,, and
he answered . that . he was "going , to ask
these questions as I wish. You . can ob
ject until you are black. in the face."
The witness said that she, made several
trips back to her. own room ' and i on one
occasion met Samuel Parks , going down
stairs. (Hutton. and Morris testified that
Parks was one of the lynching party.) \
Mrs. Gibbins said : that : the * hall Â¦/ was
lighted; that she fully. recognized, Parka, i
and that he did not have a mask on. ShÂ«
said that her. father returned to : her
mother's room and on .the; way upstair*
said , he "would , kill one * of > them before
they, got out of the hotel." ,'Â¦:Â¦ ~ ~ \>~
' Mrs. Gibbins said .that during -one of
her trips . to her room she looked; through
the. windows and saw "Jim". Brown; the
defendant, and Sidney; Goyette among the
men 1 who were . walking- down to 'the
; bridge. She recognized them perfectly, a*
Awakened by Mob's Tramping.
"The map offered can be placed In evi
dence, to be applicable and operative only
since the time it was made, some time in
December. The map cannot be retroac
tive, except by proof and agreement."
Mrs. Oliver Gibbins, daughter of J. R.
Myers, alleged to be one of the lynchers
and owner of the hotel from which the
victims were taken on the 'night of the
hanging, was called to the stand. ' She
acknowledged her thorough acquaintance
with the hotel owned by her father and
Identified various rooms for the benefit of
counsel and jury. In answer to questions
by Raker, Mrs. Gibbins said that she was
in the hotel on the night before the lynch
ing, -May 30. After supper, she washed
the dishes, made bread and later sat on
the porch with John Hutton, the witness
for the prosecution, who confessed. She
had known Samuel Parks, / the . alleged
lyncher. He stopped at the hotel on the
nignt of the lynching.
. Abbot L. Green of Hayden Hill. Lassen
County, was called to the stand. The map
he made of Trowbridges store in Lookout
was exhibited and Green was questioned
upon his work. . The examination was a
technical one, but resulted In one or. two
quarrels between counsel and threads on
the part of Judge Harrington to punish
Raker for contempt. When it came- to
having Green's map filed as an exhibit,
the court said: . ' â¢. Â¦ Â¦ :
I C. E. Tolle, surveyor, who made the
maps oCthe Myers Hotel and other points
in Lookout pertaining to the lynching
case, was. on the stand again this after
noon. Having made certain additions to
his maps, as suggested by Judge Harring
ton, they were admitted as exhibits.
A. A. Smith, County Surveyor, testified
to having assisted Tolle in the work of
surveying the points around Lookout.
Tolle's Maps Are Admitted.
Sturtevant asked the court not to call
a recess as so little had been accomplished
during the morning session. Raker tried
to get in a few words, but was cut short
by the court again ordering a recess.
After the court had left the room the
jury, in consultation, protested against
the numerous early adjournments result-
Ing from the actions of counsel, the court
frequently declaring a -recess to cut off
the unpleasant arguments that have char
acterized the case from the beginning.
Raker to offer the photo
graph In evidence, as a refused exhibit.
The court took the photograph and hand
ed it to Russell, the photographer, who
'was on the stand,- telling him to put it
into his pocket. Raker protested that the
photograph was his private property and
the court said that he would put it into
the stove if the subject were not dropped.
High words followed and the court cut
the argument short by. ordering a recess.
fered the photograph as an exhibit ' this
morning.
.The -court sustained an objection, say
ing that he had- ruled on this question
several times and that Raker was in con
tempt of court for attempting to introduce
a photograph as evidence in the face of a
contrary ruling by the court.

tors Mark and Denman and they may de->
ci(Jfr to resign before "submitting to the or
deal of replying to them. It is alleged
against Mark and Denman that they act
ed" Â¦with prejudice in the matter- of re
moving teachers who were given a trial.
Principal among thaC accusers of the two
Directors is former . Vice Principal Ebe
nezer Knowlton, recently dismissed from
.the department, who, with his attorney,
Henry C. McPIke, has placed the # matter
before the chief executive.
Knowlton alleges that he was con
demned even before his trial commenced
on the charges preferred by Principal Ly
ser of the John Swett School. He fur
ther alleges that the trial was not fairly
conducted and that no attention was paid
to his evidence, which he asserts utterly
destroyed the testimony that he was in
competent. Knowlton refers to a remark
made by Director Mark, in support of his
contention, to the effect that Principal
Lyser's testimony was lamentably weak
and that it did not support the charges
that were made against Knowlton. Di
rector Mark said further that "Knowlton
always did talk too much. This board
suspended him once and other boards
have done likewise." Knowlton claims
that this is an open admission that he
was not tried on the evidence, but on the
belief existing in the minds of the Direc
tors. All this â¢ and considerable of like
import has been placed before ,' Mayor
Schmitz, who promises a speedy inquiry.
Teachers Not Legally Tried.
Another line of Inquiry to be pursued
by the Mayor is that 6f the course oi
Phelan's board in trying accused teach
ers on its own responsibility, when the
charter specifically . provides that the
charges must first be investigated by the
Superintendent and report made by him
to the board. -
Denman and -Mark, as the remaining
members of the board, will be asKed to
explain why they "stood in" to ignore the
report of Superintendent Webster that
the charges filed against certain teach
ers were frivolous and that the accusers
would not swear to them, as the law pro
vides. In the face of that report, the
board proceeded to try several teachers,
some of whom secured restraining orders
in the courts, while others lost their po
sitions.. All this Denman and Mark will
have. to explain and the questioning may
become so warm that they, like Casserty,
may realize the advisability of resigning.
Political Complexion of Board.
The father of School Director Wood
ward was the owner* of the Alta. a news
paper which was successful for many
years. The new Director is associated
with a printing firm, is a graduate of the
University of California and a civil en
gineer by profession. He is a member of
the present Grand Jury, but will Immedi
ately resign therefrom. He was president
of the Primary. League and a director in
the Glen Ellen Home for Feeble Minded.
Casserly, the retiring Director, was a
Democrat. The charter requires that
"the board shall never be so constituted
as to consist of more than two members
of the same political party." The three
remaining members of the board are re
spectively Democrat, Republican and
Union Labor, thus leaving the Mayor the
vower to appoint a member of any of the
three parties to the .vacant place.
Mayer Schmitz issued the following
statement yesterday afternoon explain
ing his reasons for appointing Woodward.
In making a selection for the vacancy on the
Board of Education I desire a man of experi
ence in the school department of this city,
and one acquainted with the educational needs
of the people and their children.
Experiment has demonstrated that
professional educators have not given
general satisfaction either to the pub
lic or to the teachers of the depart
ment. I want the teachers within th?
limits of their rights ;to be satisfied
and to bs treated fairly, so that they
will cheerfully and enthusiastically
give their best to the education of
their pupils, and take a cordial inter
est in their work.
The prominent men in the Union Labor party
open to accept appointments at my hands are
in my opinion from their experience and quali
fications better suited for and would prefer
other positions. I have therefore decided to
tender the place to a gentleman of the Re
publican party, whom I have known Inti
mately for many years, and who was not a
candidate for the place.

of advanced age, is incapacitated from

Mayor regarding the alleged extrava

marks, and the Mayor promised to makÂ»
an impartial investigation of the charges.

former president was pleased to term
them, "council meetings," are to be dis
continued. Superintendent Webster and
Director Roncpvieri are both in favor of
transacting the business In public The
charter gives the Police Commission
alone the right to hold executive sessions.
An exception will be made in the case
of a teacher whose reputation or compe
tency Is called into question and charges
regularly preferred. Superintendent Web
ster is of the opinion that in such cases
it Is but fair to the accused to hold exec
utive sessions, as he or she might be
proven guiltless of the charges.
Webster will begin his battle to-day for
additional accommodations for pupils in
many of the schools by recommending
that new classes be established In the ,
Buena Vista, Edison, Agassiz, Haiffht/
Henry Durant and Monroe schools. The
board' has already signified Its intention
to form new classes in three of tha
schools.
Superintendent "Webster will submit
at to-day's meeting the report of
his investigations into the charges
of dereliction of duty preferred
against Physical Director Magnus. Tho
outlook, for Magnus retaining his position
is dark, for "Webster â¢will recommend that
the position be abolished. From written
reports filed by principals of several
schools it Is shown that during the entire
year of 1901 Magnus devoted a total of but
110 hours to the work for which he was
employed, and for this he drew $2700 from
the city's coffers, which Is at the rate
of about $25 per hour.

SCHMITZ TELLS WHY HE SUSPENDED WILLIAMS.
SHORTLY after my election my attention was
called by a friend to a carload of deputies, clerks
and other officials bound for tlie ferry to take the 1:30
o'clock boat to the racetrack at Emeryville. I was as
tounded when the names of at least a dozen on that
car were given me. I was expressing/ my surprise at
the audacity of these employes, when, on the next car,
another group was pointed out to me, also bound for
the racetrack, among them being Mr. Williams. On the
preceding car had been at least: two of his deputies,
his duties. If the work of the office can be done zvithout
their attending to it, their positions should be declared
vacant and the amount of their salaries left in the city
treasury.
' -I fiave information that the amounts of money lost
by some of these municipal officials in betting at the
racetrack far exceeds their salary, and have been ad
vised to havejheir financial accounts experted. I pro
pose to ; do this also: \ I mean this suspension as an ex
ample and warning. â Statement by Mayor Eugene E.
Schmitz.
and, as this was a business day, it struck me as a
most outrageous proposition that both. principal and dep
uties should thus neglect their duties. I decided to in
vestigate the matter fully and these charges are ' in a
measure the product of that investigation.
Mr. Williams' office is not the only offender in this
regard. There are deputies and clerks in the Sheriff's
office, and in the County Clerk's office also, who are
also daily frequenters of \ the < racetrack. I am deter
mined to 'put an end to these practices. During my
term of office every municipal employe must attend to

mine last night, and Fred Dunsmore and
Gus Her6hberg were Injured, the latter
probably fatally. The accident occurred
at 11 o'clock. In the darkness Gardner
failed to notice that a platform, used to
cover the mouth of the shaft when the
cage Is at the bottom, was not In its
place, and he pushed the empty car into
the shaft, supposing that* the cage was
there to receive it. He went down a dis
tance of 170 feet with the car. A projec
tion in the shaft penetrated his groin and
he bled to death in fourteen minutes. One
of his arms was broken and he received
internal Injuries that would have proved
fatal. â¢
Dunsmore and Hershberg were standing
beside the cage when the car-struck anq
were saved from instant death only by the
cage breaking the fall of the car. As It
was, Hershberg sustained fractures of
two ribs and internal injuries that may
cause his death. Dunsmore's injuries are
not serious. . - ..

With the exception of* Robert Dennis
all the deputies in the office were at once
suspended from duty by Fredrick, who
served each of them with the following
notification:'- .
Last evening Powell Fredrick took for
mal possession of the office of the clerk
to the Justices of the Peace.
Fredrick has resided in this city for the
past ten years and has been engticed in
the wholesale jewelry business at 220 Sut
ter street. He managed the recent cam
paign for Mayor Schmitz and his many
friends are delighted at his selection for
official duty by the Mayor.
Powel Fredrick, who has been appointed
by the Mayor to discharge the duties of
chief clerk to the Justices of the Peace,
was sworn in last evening by Deputy
County Clerk W. A. Deane. Fredrick fur
nished his bonds and will assume his
duties this morning.
Those of the delinquent officials who
had been away from their desks during
the day were informed of the suspension
of Williams later on and warned to be at
their desks this morning
R^\n if the Mayor finds that every of
ficial in the city's employ strictly attends
to his duties from now on, past offenses
will not be condoned. The list of sus.
pected and accused officials is safe in the
Mayor's possession and there is likely to
be an upheaval in the ranks of those who
hold their positions on account of the
political "pull" of Boss Crimmins and his
crowd. .

SUSPENSION and appointments
are the order of the day at the
City Hall, and Mayor Schrrltz
has his hands full of business.
The Mayor suspended E. W.
Williams, chief clerk of the Jus-
tices of the Peace, yesterday on
charges of constant neglect of duty.
These form the ground for the probable
removal of "Williams from office. Powel
Fredrick was appointed by the Mayor and
sworn in to take the place of Williams.
T. P. Woodward, a former School Di
rector, was appointed by the Mayor to
Jill the vacancy on the Board of Educa
tion caused by the resignation of J. **â¢
CE-sserly. The Mayor is likely to have
two other vacancies to fill, as School Di
rectors Denman and Mark are scheduled
to walk the carpet.
ilayor Schmitz will try Clerk K. W.
Williams on charges of neglecting his
duties and spending his time at the race
tracks, saloons and poolrooms, and also
lor allowing his deputies to be absent
from their posts during business hours.
The suspension of Wiiliams is likely to
be followed by similar action in the case
of deputies in the Sheriff's and County
Clerk's oSices, the Mayor having a lis.. 01
those officials who draw public salaries
and do nothing in return except sign their
names to the payrolls.
Strikes at "Boss" Crimmins.
In placing Williams on trial and proo
ebly removing him from office Mayor
Schmitz will strike a blow at the very
center of the power wielded by "Boss"
Crimralns and his satellites in the City
"Hall
Williams has been associated with
Crimmins for many years, and it was
through the influence of the boss that he
secured his position. The suspended clerk
of the Justices of the Peace was mixed up
with Crimmins in securing a lease of tne
Lincoln School lots some years ago from
the Board of Education.
When Williams was given his appoint
ment as clerk to the Justices of the Peace
Crimmins saw a. fine opportunity to place
seme of his henchmen. There are live
Justices' Courts, and Williams was al
lowed five deputies. It has been a matter
of common gossip that almost the entire
work of the courts fell on the shoulders
cf Robert Dennis and that George Mc-
Conb aided him in his duties. The rest
cf the deputies were rarely, if ever, seen
at their posts, except when payday came
around and it was necessary for them to
sign the salary lists.
Draw Fay for No "Work.
Pat Prendergast. one of "Williams' dep
uties, has acted lor some years as the
private secretary of Boss Crimmins ana
was a factor in the fight of Bert Mahony
for the office of County Clerk.
James Craven, another deputy. la
known as the bodygruard of the notorious
boss who dictated the selection of the
deputies in the County Clerk's office.
J. Everett Sharp is a well known
worker for Crimmins and is also on the
city's payroll as a deputy in the Justices*
courts.
J. S. Wardell was appointed by ex-
Mayor Phelan as an extra clerk to the
Justices. Wardell ran against Lackmann
for the office of Sheriff, and. though he
draws a salary as a public servant, he
devotes nearly all his time to publish
ing a daily commercial newspaper.
When Mayor Schmitz went' Into office
tjs attention was drawn to the flagrant
manner in which officials in the City Hall
were neglecting their duties. The Mayor
one day eaw What has been a familiar
sight to hundreds of citizens, namely, the
city's employes wending their way along
Market street to "do the line" and visit
the racetrack during business hours.
In order that there might be no loop
hole for "Williams to escape. Mayor
Bchmitz requested a certain citizen to
keep a watch on the dally doings of Wil
liams and report on the same.
Daily Neglected His Duties.
That Wifhams -was a daily attendant
at the racetrack and a frequenter of sa
loons in busines? hours Is shown by the
following charges filed against Williams:
To the Hon. E. E. Schmltz. Mayor of the
City and County of San Franciscoâ Sir: I
hereby charge E. W. Â¦Williams, chief clerk of
the Justices cf the Peace of the city and

suspension and removal.

THE SAN FBANCISOO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 22, 1902.
AT 1:30 this morning Williams, with Attorney T. D. Riordan, secured a writ of certiorari from Judge Carroll Cook. Accompanied by Deputy County Clerk E. J. Casey they went to the City Hall- They were stopped
by Police Officer O'Connor, but secured permission by telephone from County Clerk Mahony to file papers in his office. In the meantime Lieutenant Birdsall telephoned to Mayor Schmitz, who instructed him to eject
the men from the City Hall, but trie.writ, which enjoins the Mayor and Fredrick from interfering with Williams and isrnade returnable before Judge Cook Saturday morning at 10, had been filed.

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a discovery
of great value to the medical profession . and
the public. They are an unfailing specific in
all cases of dyspepsia and disordered diges-
tion.
Almost everybody's digestion ,1s disordered
more or less, and the commonest thins they
do for it Is to take some 'one of the many so-
called blood purifiers, which in many casts ars
merely strong cathartics. Such things are not
needed. If the organs are In a clogged condi-
tion, they need only a little help and they
will right themselves. Cathartics Irritate the
sensitive linings of the stomach and bowels
and often do more harm than good.
Purging Is not what is needed. The thing
to do Is to put the food In condition to ' bo
readily digested and assimilated. Stuart's
Dyspepsia. Tablets do this perfectly. They
partly digest what is eaten and give- thÂ»
stomach Just the help it needs. They stimu-
late tne secretion and excretion of the diges-
tive fluids and relieve the congested condition
of the glands and membranes. They pnt tha
whole digestive system In condition to do Its
work. When that Is done you need take no
more tablets, unless you eat what does not
agree with, you. Then take one or two tab-
lets â give them needed help and you will have
no trouble.
It's a common-sense medicine and a com-
mon-sense treatment and It will cure every
time. Not only cure the disease but cure the
cause. Goes about it In a perfectly sensible
and nclentlflc way. .
We nave testimonials enough to fill a book.
but we don't publish many of them. How-
ever â
Mrs. E. M. Faith of Byrd's Creek, Wis..
Bays: "I have taken all the Tablets I rot of
you and they have done their work well la my
case, for I feel like a different person alto-
gether. I don't doubt if I had not got them Z
should have been at rest by this time."
H. E. Wlllard, Onslow, la., says: "Mr.
White of Canton was telling me of your Dys-
pepsia Tablets curing him of Dyspepsia, from
which he had suffered for eight years. As I
am a sufferer myself I wish you to sÂ«nd me
a package by return mall."
Phil Brooks, Detroit, Mich., says: "Tour
dyspepsia cure has worked wonders In my
case. I suffered for years from dyspepsia bat
am now entirely cured and enjoy life as f
never have before. I gladly recommend them."'

Perhaps Coffee Is Getting Its Work
SPOT HIM.
People who think they can digest cof-
fee and yet are sick half the time might
learn a valuable lesson In health and get
some happiness out of life If they would
make up their minds to quit coffee and
take Postum Food Coffee.
You can trace the results so accurately
as to leave no possible doubt of the cause
of the sickness and the reasons for the
return of health-
A lady from Blue Mount, Miss., gives
her experience. She says: "I always used
to drink milk, but In *88 I went down to
the southern part of the State to teach
school and boarded In a family of coffee
drinkers. I began drinking one half of a
cap at a meal. The habit grew on me and
I Increased the amount.
"Gradually I became nervous, my com-
plexion grew sallow and yellow and fin-
ally my stomach would frequently throw
off the food. I gradually ate less and less,
depending upon the coffee to keep me up.
Finally I concluded that the trouble was
malaria, and the doctor advised me to
leave that part of thÂ© country. So I went
back up to the hills In the hope of getting
better. Instead of that I got worse. Pal-
pitation of the heart set In and. I got so
weak I could scarcely work.
"I took a great many remedies, but
found no relief. I went to the mountains
in California for two months without 1m-
pro\-ement. I was thoroughly discour-
aged about my condition when. one day
a friend said, 'Why don't you give up
coffee?' 'Quit coffee.* I said. 'Why that
is ;ibout all I live on.' She begged me to
try leaving it off and use Postum Food
Coffee.
"I did not have much faith in the ex-
Verifnent, I had tried so many things
without benefit, but I decided to yield to
her entreaties. In less than two weeks
after I quit coffee and began using Pos-
tum the pall of 111 health left me and I
began to sleep as sound as any. one. My
complexion Improved and my stomach
began to regain Its strength.
"Now, after three months' use of Pos-
tum, I feel as well as I ever did. I would
not be' without Postum Food Coffee and
Â¦will never drink another drop of coffee. It
came too near killing me." Mrs. Vera

The military department of Columbia

last evening -at Mechanics" Pavilion." The"
V Adolph -, Albersmeyer, "a bartender in the
employ .of his cousin. J. D. Heise, grocer,
at the ' corner of : Sixteenth \ and Valen
cia streets, met his' death ,ln a pe :

ing; of Police-officer Robinson. â¢Albers
meyer. was 'employed as a clerk by: HÂ«?fsÂ«"
and left: his place of ; business about 10
o'clockat night. ; -He went to his room
at; 192 Julian avenue and- was awakened
by the shots. â¢ tivS^&ftVS^&SfftSSS^i
He partly dressed' himself' when he
heard the shots. E. P. Langabaugh, the*

Curiosity.
Had it not been for the heartless greed
of the telephone company for the nickel
that it demands for a switch, Robinson,
the wounded policeman, .might have
reached a ' hospital sooner than he did.
Police Officer R. J. Ingham lives in the
flat immediately above the scene, of the
shooting. He was asleep at the time,' but
was awakened by the sound of shotd.
Ingham says:- ..
| I grot up. partly dressed myself and went to
my window. - I saw a man lying: on the side
walk with his arms thrown back. The light
was uncertain, but I thought I saw a star on
his breast. I . rushed Â¦ downstairs and saw
Robinson lying by the hitching post in front
of Kenney's place. I saw that he was wound
ed and ran upstairs to my telephone.
"Give me Private Exchange 170." I said.
."There ia a wounded police officer on the side
walk and I. want an ambulance quick." It was
a Ion* time afterward before I got ah answer
and then came a Ions drawn-out. "Nickel,
please."
I got mad arfiS told the j-ouns woman the
smallest chance I hart was a dollar, but the
j answer came back. "Nickel, please." I told
,the young woman what I thought of the tele-
I'Phone company end I ran to the patrol box at
i Sixteenth street and called for an ambulance.
It was fully three-auartera of an hour from
! the time I first tried to telephone before either
the â¢ ambulance or patrol wagon came alonar.
In the, meanwhile. Robinson was picked np off
the street and carried mto Eastman's plumb
ing shop, from which hÂ« was taken Â¦ to the hos

the early morning tragedy indicate be
yond a shadow of a doubt that tha four
desperados were engaged in holding up
a Japanese on Valencia street near Eight
eenth when Officer .Robinson surprised
them at their nefarious work, as exclu
sively announced in yesterday's issue of
The Call. The four footpads had been
hovering- abofit the neighborhood i for an
hour or more before the shooting oc
curred. They attempted to hold up At
torney Stephen Costello at the corner of
Eighteenth and Valencia streets, but the
latter was too quick for them. As Cos
tello wasnearing his home,- whlcn is at
726 Valencia street, he passed three of the
footpads. When he got a few steps ahead
of them one of the men called out, "Here,
hold on a minute!" \ . . , â¢ . ,
"Not much," replied Costello, suspect
ing at once that they wanted to relieve
him of his money and jewelry. The at
-torney quickened his pace toward hi?
home, a few steps away, and the f.ootpad3
made no attempt to follow him.
As the lawyer - entered his doorway he
heard several loud screams, and turning
around he saw G. R. Aklyo, a Japanese
living at 719 Valencia street, running
away from the same men who tried to
hold him up.
The footpads put a revolver up to
Akiyo's head and\ ordered him to throw
up his bands. Frenzied with fright the
Jap yelled frantically for help, and made
a mad dash, toward his home;- - .
â¢ At. this juncture Policeman Robinson,
who was standing on the corner of Nine
teenth and Valencia, came running down
the street at a fast clip. He was one of
the best sprinters in the department and
hÂ« arrived at the scene of the attempted
hold-up before the footpads could make
their escape.
Saw Kobinson Coming.
â¢Â¦ The thieves must have got a glimpse of
Robinson's star, and fearing arrest they,
turned and ran down ..Valencia street
toward Sixteenth. The brave policeman
pursued the criminals and gained on them
so quickly that by the time they, got to
the middle of the block -on Valencia street,
between Sixteenth and Seventeenth, -he
was almost at their heels.
In front of Kenney's bicycle store at 531
Valencia street and Rogerson's shirt fac
tory at 535 Valencia, the footpads made a
stand. They could â¢ not outsprlnt Robin
son, bo they turned quickly and began fir-'
ing: -at- the; policeman. -s One of the â¢ first
shots knocked : Robinson, -down and the
thugs stood over his bleeding, body and

trate form. ... â¢ ,
Detectives Fitzgerald and Graham, who
have been. following up the course of the
fugitive highwaymen, traced their move
ments to-day up to the time they reached
a saloon at the corner of Eleventh and
Market streets. Two men, closely resem
bling those described by Mebels, went
into the 'saloon, called for- a glass of beer,
laid down a dollar on the counter and,
without waiting for change, ran off.
They acted very suspiciously and turned
v.-ettward on Market street, in the direc
tion of Valencia. - ' â¢ â¢ â¢Â¦"-: i
. From there all trace of them was lost
until last evening, when two menweie
seen . at - Florentlni's place, near the old,
San "Bruno road. They claimed to be ex
soldiers in search of work. The .two men
fitted the description of the men ' recog-.
nized byMebels, also by the bartender at-
Eleventh and Market streets and by Flor
entinl. When.. Fitzgerald .and Graham
reached Florentini's the men had fled and
the trail was temporarily lost. Both Fitz
gerald and Graham are positive that the
men who were. at Florentini's yesterday
afternoon are the two whom the police are
locking for. The Sari Mateo County offi
cers i have ' been notified to look -out for
them and have been furnished with a3
complete a descrrption as possible.

last race. The gelding was in to be sold
for $-iOO and Frank Doss tilted the price
to $SO0 without any change of ownership.

he was iluden by Red fern, ' while yester
day O'Connor had the mount.' "

KENILWORTH,, the dark brown
bird | wearing the . sharp claws,
from Harry Stover's aviary,
ploughed along through the mud
; \Tand rain in real old-fashioned
style- at : Oakland :yesterday. Stover's
horse was-; one: : of five .starters- In the
fourth race', : a six furlong sprint, the con
ditions stating "for non-winners at the
meeting: weight 103 ; "pounds." 'What a
soft, and reposeful/.-spot; It-, looked,', and
these were -the- .entries: Joe-Frey,' AH
Green, Kenilworth. Paul Clifford, Rey
Dare and ".The Fretter. With, his usual
forethought -. Johnny "Schorr' missed the
train leaving -Ingleside and Joe Frey did
not appear as a starter. Kenilworth,. just
about tuned .to concert, pitch with two
previous races, was played from evens to
3 to 5, and reeling off the first half in
48% seconds," finished the distance out in,
1:14, a length; before Paul Clifford, which
ran a becoming race first- time -at the
barrier, nicely . ridden by Gannon. All
Green did not appear to be ready, finish
ing fourth 'behind The 'Fretter. .
Favorites \ managed - to hold their own
despite the. uncertain conditions of the
elements,, capturing- three events.' Jack

Green Morris" useful "mudder,'.* Duckoy,
was again unlucky enough to be nosed out
for a purse, this time in the Paso Robles

racing Tower, of Candles, to a standstill
kept the outsider on . hte mud legs long
enough to beat O'Connor on the fast-com
ing favorite* just about half a pro
gramme's ler^th. Frank . Bell ran third.
A fast bunch of "mudlarks" lined up
In the Introductory five and a half fur
long scramble, with Tiburon the post
favorite at 8 to 5. .The Friar Tuck geld
ing displayed some of his oldtime speed
to the stretch, and then died away. Red
fern assumed the lead with Eldred. an.S
t& 1 .shot, when . straightened for home,
and led to within a few yards of the
wire, '.where O'Connor got up on Censor,
earning the decision by a nose. The win
ner was 12 to 1 in the betting.. Â¦
Another long shot turned up winner of
the- sprint- which Â»folowed. - If- looked . a
good thing on paper for Royal Rogue, and
the Nealon entry was heavily played at
8 to 5. Malaspina, a 10 to 1 chance, piloted

something to spare. Arthur Ray ran a

27. to 1 shot, with Troxler up, nosed- out
Sir Lewis for the place.
."When the Board. of Police Commission
ers went-' into session Â¦ last evening Chief
of Police Wittman informed the board of
the death ,of Patrolman Robinson. The
Chief spoke feelingly bÂ£ the deceased. He
said Robinson had always proved a capa
ble officer, and that his untimely death
wa , s a severe loss to the department. The
tmef dwelt on Robinson's heroism. He
told how, the brave policeman gave battle,
to the footpads and how he was slain by
Â°ne orthe criminals. -
The Chief also called the- board's atten-
i on t0 , tne fact .that there was a. pro
vision in the charter. which allowed" the
commissioners, sitting .as a pension
board,: the right to grant a pension â¢ to
tne wife Qr parent of an officer who had
lost his life. --Tn the discharge. of his duty.
As Robinson leaves a mother, half his
salary will be paid to her monthly.
. commissioner Hutton moved that when
the board adjourn it' do so out of re
spect to the memory of Policeman Robin
son and that - the members 6f the board
attend his funeral in a body. The motion
was adopted unanimously.,
yolvers glisten when they passed a gas
light and he called on them to halt: "I
am a police officer," shouted Taylor.
Taylor's command to halt was greeted
with several shots from the murderers,
i hey wheeled to tire. at the policeman,
several shots being discharged at Wm.
Taylor never flinched under the lire,
He quickly dropped on one knee, and,
drawing his revolver, returned Â»he tire,
laylor shot three 'times at Robinson's
murderers and then jump/d : to his feet
and continued the chase. They ran down
Julian avenue cm the lower side of tl>*
street, Taylor following them. Â¦ ;.
At the corner of Fifteenth street ai'cl
Julian avenue the trio separated. Two or
the men ran up Fifteenth toward Valen
cia, arid the other stood at. the corner on
the lower* side of the street, waiting to
ambush Taylor as he ran by. The police
man was. not to be tricked by ..the fooi
pad s cunning. He dashed across to the
other side of the street and taking aim
at the thug who was waiting in Â¦Â¦ thÂ«
shadows to shoot him down, fired,- and
the waiting- man staggered headlong to
the sidewalk. â¢ Â¦
Policeman Taylor was upon the, pros
trate highwayman ' in a moment and
pinned him to the. ground. Taylor dis
armed his man and walked him toward
the Seventeenth-street station. On,' the
way to the. station Taylor met Lieutenant
Price,' who : was going to. the scene of. the
first â¢ shooting, and turned the wounded
prisoner over to him.. VÂ« .â¢;â¢
Carried Safe-Cracking Tools.
When searched at the City and County
Hospital a full set of safe-cracking tools
was found concealed on the captive's
person. In his overcoat pocket the police
found a. bottle of powder, two candles, a
brace and bit, matches and a steel tape
measure. The footpad's weapon was . a
38-caliber bulldog of the cheapest make.
In -addition to the .safe-cracking tools
there were in his pockets several cata
logues issued by different hardware firms
who deal in steel saws and other imple
ments used in the safe-cracking business.
The prisoner said his name was William
A. Henderson and that' his home was , in
.St. Louis. He said he came here recent
ly from 1 Seattle and had found the tools
that were in his possession on the street.
He pretended to be very much under .the
â¢influence of- liquor and stated that when
he stooped down to pick .up the things
he claimed to have found he was shot
from behind. He also stated that his
partner's name was Williams and that
they had been around various saloons in
the Mission drinking all night.'SNo state
ment made by the man who calls himself
Henderson is believed by the'police. He
acted like an old offender and showed no
disposition to give up any information
concerning 'his part in the murder. , 'â¢ â¢;
Robinson Too Weak- to, Talk, .-.i
i â¢ While Policeman Taylor was' having Ms
exciting '.thase' after. theÂ«Â»three* footpads
who ran down Julian-avenue tender hands
were lifting the bleeding form of Police-
man Robinson across Valencia-street- to
Eastman's v plumbing- shop, > where â¢ the
wounded man was attended by Drs. Sul
livan and Crowley. The: ambulance was
telephoned for .by. Policeman. Tim Connell
and. when it arrived .Robinson 'was taken
at once to the Railroad Hospital,, whet e
Dr. Gardner wade heroic efforts to save
his life. Robinson began to sink rapidly.
He- could scarcely talk at times and then
again he would rally and answer questions
put to him by his- companions in the
police department, who wereÂ«bent on find
ing some clew to Robinson's murderers.
Detectives Jerry Dinan and Richard Beil
were on night duty .at the Hall of Justice
when the fatal shooting occurred. They
were, notified immediately and, j together
with Warrant and Bond Clerk John J.
Greeley, went immediately to the bedside
of the dying policeman. The detectives
saw at once that it, would be useless to
attempt to get Robinson to make a writ
ten dying statement. He was already too
far over the border: Detective Dinan and
Greeley asked . the dying man questions
and he answered them laboriously.
'"I can't talk, boys," said Robinson
feebly. Â¦' " â¢ -Â¦-Â¦Â¦Â¦
In answer to questions Robinson told
the -detectives that he found the footpads
trying to hold up a man on'Valencia and
Eighteenth streets. Â¦ He was positive there
were four men in the party.- Â¦ -.- Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢
The nurses and physicians worked over
the rapidly sinking . policeman -in a vain
effort to revive him. 'sufficiently so he
could make a statement.- Â¦
Prisoner Gives Evasive Answer.
After leaving the dying policeman De
tectives Dinan and' Bell and Warrant and
Bond Clerk Greeley went direct to the
City and County Hospital, where they had
a long interview with the wounded foot
pad. Henderson-was sullen and pretended
to be in great pain. He disclaimed all
knowledge of the battle with the. two
policemen and. refused to say anything
about himself. He even said that he did
not know where he lived. It was some
where on Fifth street, near, the Mint, but
thdexact location, he did not know,' so ; ha
said. He said he roomed in No. 21, on
the second floor of the lodging-house, but
he would not give the street . number of
the' place. -.;.â¢.'.. : '-Â¦ - - '
The officers then went to the Seven
teenth-street station, where they closely
inspected 1 every article found on Hender
son. They' found several cards upon
which' were written .local addresses, and
for a time it looked as if the officers had
a clew- to the prisoner's identity. On one
card the name, Mrs. Lauriate, 312B Turk
street, was written. The, woman proved
to be the wife of a transport officer. She
could not shed any light on the mystery
of t~ Henderson's identity. She did not
know him and could not Imagine any pos
sible way in which the footpad could
have foundout her address. ' On another
card , found in Henderson's pockets the
name, Gus Miller, 1084 Sutter street, ap-'
peared. -This also proved to>be a false
scent. On a receipt for a registered let
ter sent to ' George : Moore alias Mason,
now confined in "the Stockton jail on a
charge of -robbery, the_ name F. Daly, 219
Stockton* street, appeared. ' This address
was a .fake to prevent detection .In case
the j Stockton . authorities j intercepted the
letter. There^ is no such number as; 219
Stockton street, : and the place where . it
should be- is a public park.' The* card of
a nearby Stockton-street saloon was also
found on Henderson. These clews > tend
to < shdw Â¦ that the Â¦ prisoner was familiar
with i that: neighborhood. It was, learned
last night that Mrs. , Lauriate worked In
a Stockton-street candy, store up to a
week â¢Â¦Â¦ ago. . A permit issued by Sheriff
Lackmann for ; John Gilley : to visit R.
Galley, now confined .in, the County "Jail
on a, charge of robbery, : was Â¦ also *. found
among Henderson's; papers. .-The address
given in this paper. was. also a fake.
Policeman 5 Robinson was one- of the
most popular and efficient officers in the
department. He was a Free Mason. and
had, taken the third degree in ; the order
only, a short time, ago. He was an un

. i. Â¦w-Ith fortj--four cabin passengers,
. fifty-five passengers in the steer-
Egre. four stowaways and a big cargo.
The presence on board of the four unde
eired passengers caused quite a delay In

detained while the quarantine officials
made up their minds as to the disposal
cf the stowav.\iys. They were finally
landed at Ange! Island, where their case
â¢will be considered later. Among the
freight was a large consignment of

I Those inclined to the belief that tHe
Condor was lost when the r Matteawan
went down point to the fact that- the
steamer Queen City, on her last trip from
the west coast, reported, that the broken
pieces of a hardwood ship's boat, painted
white inside and outside and. with a dark
rim around the gunwale, had been found
on Bonilla Point, near Carmanah. Boats
of this description are carried by . war
ships and by but few othercraft. . ,";,. |
The missing Condor is one' of seven ves
sels of the same type which were
launched by the builders In England at
the same time. One of these "was -the
sloop-of-war Wasp, which was lost about
five years ago. She was , never heard of
after - sailing from England;; and of'hur
-total -complement- none: escaped , and: not
a vestige of the- wreck was ever found. ]
. The I Condor- was a. new vessel, f being
the fourth of that name In the: British
navy. She was of 9S0 tons, 1400 horse
power and carried in all 140 men; She
was commanded by â¢. Captain Clifton
Slater, well knowh-as'a' capable: sailor,

Another opinion advanced by some of
the naval men at Esquimau and which
offers the largest measure of hope,"" is .that
the Condor, driven . from Â¦ her course by
storms, may have continued under sail
to the . Pitcalrn Islands, and the other
islands of the South Seas where the
cables do not touch. Her ultimate ;desti
nation was the Pitcalrn Islands, but she
was to have gone by way of .Honolulu,
and was scheduled to arrive there :on
December 13. ' Â¦ > . . , ' ' ' . ' :'"
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 2Lâ When. It was
learned here to-day that the . liner Ala
meda had arrived In San Francisco, bring
ing no news of the missing British sloop
of war Condor,' hope that the'vessel had
not gone down was abandoned by the gen
eral public. The fact that the "Condor
sailed out of the straits on the evening
of the awful gale in which the Matteawan
was. lost and which buffeted the larger
warship Warsprlte. aroused forebodings
weeks ago, when the vessel was but a few
days overdue. Nearly seven .weeks have
now elapsed since the Condor sailed and
the. opinion of. landsmen and. many ship
ping men is that she will never be. heard
irom again. ' V- --,'Â¦'Â¦'
Despite the gloomy outlook the officers
of the Admiralty profess to have not lost
hope.- Captain Meet of H. M.S. Phaeton,
which left ' yesterday In search of the
sloop, was of the opinion that she had run
short of coal, or possibly had broken her
shaft and was sailing to the islands in
the face of the heavy head winds which
are' known to. have prevailed foe some
time past. He instanced cases where it
has taken other warships as long as forty
eight days to reach Honolulu and where
liners have drifted without their propellers
and under scant canvas for months. .
Captain Simpson of. H. M. Â»S. Egerla,
who is now commanding officer of this
station, is also hopeful that the Condor
will arrive in port -eventually. He is of
the opinion that the Condor has been de
layed by. some accident. She is a small
vessel and cannot carry much coal. Hav
ing to' battle with winds and heavy seas,
her engineers would have endeavored to
husband their coal, of the quality of
which there were many complaints be-^
fore she left port. In this event, with her
scant supply- of canvas and her record
1 as a slow sailor, it would not be surpris
ing that she had not' yet reached Hono
lulu. ... " - .

When John Adams was Vice President
of the United States more than 100 years
ago he paid ?40 for a little gilt-framed
mirror, and there has been trouble about
it ever since. Several Senators in the
course of the debate" over the payment
for. its purchase took occasion to censure
Mr. Adams for. having set an example of
unwarranted extravagance. The mirror
was purchased in New York, brought to
Washington and put in place in the room
occupied by the Vice President,' and for
a great many years was. pointed out to
rural visitors, who were entertained with
more or Ies3 accurate tales of its history.

PIN MAKINGâ Subscriber, City. In tha
United States' ho effort at pin making was
made until the wat of 1S12, when tha In
terruption of commerce had raised th<?
price of these useful articles to $1 per
paper. At the old State prison In wh^t
was then called Greenwich village, now a
part of New York City, the first attempts
at pin making were tried, and similar at
tempts were made in the Bellevue Alms
house in 1S29, but both trials were given
up as failures. Meanwhile Lemuel W.
Wright of Masachusetts invented machin
ery to cheapen and improve the manufac
ture of pins. He did not succeed in in
troducing the machines in this country,
so he went to London, England, and there
obtained a patent In 1S24. The first ma
chines did not succeed, but by Improve
ments success was achieved, and solid
headed pins were placed on the market in
1833. In 1832 machines were made by John
I. Howe of New York and were patented
in the United States. These were the fir3t
self-acting machines that really succeed
ed. At first they made the wire head, but
by Improvement they made the solid head.
The Howe Pin Company was established
In Birmingham, Conn.. In 1838. Another
large company was established about tha
same time at Poughkeepsie. N. Y., and
that was finally consolidated with th2
American Pin Company of Waterbury,
Mass.
MOUNT SHASTAâ W. C, Weavervllle.
Trinity Co., Cal. The height of Mt. Shas
ta, 14,511 feet, is sufficient to admit of the
peak being seen from a vessel going north
or south of San Francisco. To see it, how
ever, It would have to be a very clear day.
The range of vision Is one hundred and
eighty miles and ; the mount Is but 138
from the shore line-- On a clear day the
mount is visible north, of the Humboldt
county line. Between it and the ocean
there Is a peak 8000 feet high.
HEMATITEâ Laytonvllle, Mendocino
County, Cal. Hematite or specular iron
ore is one of the most common ore3 of
iron designated by its color into red and
brown hematite. It does not attract the
magnet. These ores are composed chiefly
of peroxide of Iron and are a very Im
portant source of metallic Iron. They oc
cur largely in metamorphic strata and
are found sometimes crystallized In vari

- Enormous quantities of quinine are con
sumed in this country. It is cheaper now
than ever before. Many remember when
It cost from $2 50 to $3 an ounce, before
the tariff was taken. off. Now it costs
about 50 cents an ounce. The New York
Press puts it this way: The druggist on
the next corner charges 10 cents for a
dozen two-grain caps'ules of quinine. The
one in the middle of the block. charges 7
cents. Both are "cut-rate" houses. Now,
let's see: An ounce of quinine costs the
dealer 31 cents. ] Each ounce contains 4S0
grains, sufficient for 240 two-grain cap
sules, or twenty dozen, sold over th3
counter for 1140 to $2. Capsules cost 20
cents a pound and there are enough in a
pound to contain many ounces of quinine.
The quinine the druggist sells for $2 costs
him (capsules: included) 32 cents. He 13
making, therefore, a profit of over 500 per
cent on what is actually a household ne
cessity. It is no exaggeration to say. that
quinine is a staple. In. numerous localities
it is eaten as regularly as food. Men and
women pour it into the palm of the hand
and toss itvdown their throats. Ohio and
Floridaâ my! my! The Government might
regulate the price, as the . English Gov
ernment does in India, where quinine Ja
more necessary that meat. Quinine ia sold
at every rural postofflce in India at the
rate of five grains for a farthing. That
is ten grains for a cent," or 48 cents an
ounce, retail. In Bengal . alone 1,440,000
five-grain packets are sold annually. The
Government used to* import 1250,000 worth
of quinine every year, but Lieutenant
Colonel King, superintendent" of the Royal
Botanic Gardens in Calcutta, has intro
duced its cultivation in India, and there
are now 4.0O0.C0O trees in Bengal.
Great Quinine Consumption.
ARTICLES OF DIETâ Curious, City. It
Is said that certain articles of diet are
beneficial in certain ailments, as follows:
Celery, for rheumatism and nervousness;
lettuce, for insomnia: peanuts, for indiges
tion and diabetes in the corpulent; onions,
for neuralgia; spinach, for gravel; ripe
fruit as a blood purifier; watermelon, for
epilepsy; cranberries, for erysipelas, and
tomatoes, for the liver.
A primitive sort of Turkish bath i3 in
dulged in by some of the Finlanders of
Northern Norway. In winter in this part
of the country the thermometer averages
40 degrees below zero and water bathing
is not practicable.
These Finlanders, unlike the Lapps far r
ther north, have an instinct for bodily
cleanliness and manage to preserve it
after the following fashion: Paul du
Chaillu, who spoke from personal expe
rience, declared the method' fine. Each
hamlet has a bathhouse for common use.
It is perhaps fifteen feet long by twelve
wide. It boasts no windows, and only
when the door is opened can air or light
enter. In the middle of the interior is an
ovenlike structure of bowlders 1 piled one
upon the other.
Rows of seats constructed of the
branches of trees run along the sides of
the wall. There is no other furnishing.
Bathing day comes ojice a weekâSat
urday. Uarly in the morning of that day
Â¦wood is . brought and a fire started.
' "When the stones . become hot the fire Is
put out, the place cleaned, a large ves
sel of water and some slender birch twigs
brought In and the preparations declared
complete.
As no dressing-room is provided toilets
ore unmade, and made in the various
homes. -It is scarcely necessary to add
that no time Is lost in the progress from
the "home to the bathhouse. No clothes
and a temperature of 10 degrees below
zero are incentives to haste.
When all of the boys and men are in
the bathhouse -and the door closed water
is: thrown upon the hot stones v until trie
place is filled with steam. Perspiration
pours from the sweltering bodies, yet
more active exercise is demanded and
switches come into play. Each bather
lays on; his neighbor with a will until
"Enough!" is cried. .
Again water is -thrown upon the stones,
more steam raised and another switching
indulged^ in.
As may be imagined the bodies are now
as red as boiled lobsters and the blood
circulating actively.

The next step was the appointment of a commit
tee on resolutions, and when it was announced it
was perceived that one faction had .five representa
tives on the committee and the other faction had but
two. Then the convention became Democratic. The
Philadelphia Record "says: "It became an ungovern
able, yelling, roaring, pushing, riot-threatening
mob." The committee made a report, and an at
tempt was made to call the roll for a vote by wards,
but the vote never got beyond the Fourth Ward. It
was upon the announcement of the vote of that ward

glared. at each other and clinched for a wrestle.

SIXTY years ago, when photography was in its experimental state, Miss Dor
othy Catherine Draper,' who died a few days ago at Hastings, N. Y., in her
'. ninety-fifth year, sat for her picture, and that likeness, which is now pre
served as a valuable heirloom by members of her family in England, was.
the first daguerreotype taken in this country. In 1830, when Daguerre first
announced his method of imprinting the likeness of a human face on a silver
coated copper plate. Miss Draper's brother. Professor John William Draper, then
a resident of New York, was experimenting with a collodion covered photo
graphic plate, /which he perfected a year later, and his sister was his first sub
ject.* Â¦Â¦ . â¢ ; , . .
There had been great drawbacks to Daguerre's method because it required
: a' sitting of at least half an hour's duration, and when Professor Draper intro
duced his invention, -which consumed about ninety seconds, it immediately became
popular. ' In describing his system Professor Draper relates in his memoirs that
it was necessary to cover the sitter's face with a white powder to bring out the*
best effects, but later this was dispensed with, and 'an excellent likeness, show
ing even the "buttons and buttonholes" in the garments of the person photo
graphed,'could be made. Fifty-seven years after she had her first picture taken,
and on the ninetieth : anniversary of her birthday, Miss Draper was again pho

FIRST DAGUERREOTYPE
A VALUABLE HEIRLOOM
SENATOR HOAR'S RESOLUTION.
THE German Kaiser 'wanted a yacht*. He
wanted a good yacht, a'nd naturally' sent to'this
country to have it built. Since 1850 we have
held the record for building the best yachts that float,
and the Kaiser, being able to pay for the best,, sought
it where it is to be found. Now naturally a yacht has"
to be launched. Like a duck, a yacht is hatched on
land, but must take to the water, and this imperial
yacht is no exception.
As the boat is built in this country its owner, who
is himself a sailor, of course wants it to be launched
with all the ceremony which the sons of Neptune.as
sociate with the launching of a boat." A* lady must
officiate and she must break â not spill, but. break â
a bottle of wine on the bow of the gliding craft just
as it leaves the land for the water. , If the bottle is
not broken it is a bad sign. It must be a bottle of
wine, or the launching is a hoodoo. Our good tem T
perance people have often tried to substitute water,
or coffee, but sailors refuse to go an a ship that had
such a baptism.
The bottle and its contents being, settled, a lady,
must be found to break the one and spill the other.
What more natural than that the Kaiser, having the'
right to choose, selected the daughter of , 'President
Roosevelt? The occasion is one that celebrates and
glorifies American ship-building, and the young lady
of the Presidential family represents the country, and
it is most proper that she do the christening. . .. ......
The Kaiser has a sailor brother, who is. very nat
urally sent over to witness the launching; as a rep
resentative of the owner of the yacht. He is' a Prince
of the house of Hohenzollern. They are a respectable
family. They started as land-owners and tillers^ of;
the soil in the Black Forest. They kept out of stocks
and speculation and kept on buying land, and be r
came Landgraves and Herzogs, and finally went into
granger politics and owned so much land that the
head of the house became an Elector, and went down
to Frankfort when a German Emperor had to be
voted for and cast his ballot in the old Kaisersalle,
and then banqueted with the other . Electors and
toasted the new Emperor in bumpers that; no head
in Germany to-day could stand. â¢ The next step in
the progress of this landed family was the erection of
their estate into the kingdom of Prussia, and one
became King. A hundred years later the family fur
nished an Emperor for Germany, and now his grand
son, this Prince Henry, is coming, over to look at
a country where every, man is an elector.
He will be treated with the courtesy due to the
descendant of the owners of the highland of Zollern.
He will compliment the daughter of our President
when she christens his brother's yacht, and the young
lady's father will have him over at the White House
to dinner. He will look down upon the two houses
of Congress from the President's gallery and then
will come as far West as Chicago and see them
stick pigs in Armour's slaughter-house. He will 1 be
treated with hospitable civility and will get .some
new ideas from his brief .visit to the greatest country
on earth. And that's all.
European diplomats are seeing great Â¦ signs and
portents in all this. It raises before them the vision
of a German-American alliance, and assumes ,- the
dimensions of a master move in welt-politik. '..One
of them gees so far as to say that no other European
knew so well as the Kaiser "how susceptible the
American people are to royal notice and royal flat
tery. Nowhere will the condescension of a crowned
head win such adulation as in the republic."
This diplomat does not know us at all. , We wish
our Government to be polite to the representatives
of all Governments. Politeness, of the heartfelt sort,
is our national characteristic. But the condescen
sion is on our part entirely. Prince Henry is a nice
young German gentleman, but he is no curiosity.
We are accustomed to meet nice Germans here. We
have long known Schurz and the ' late Dr. Otten
dorfer, and German gentlemen and scholars who by
coming here became the equals of Prince Henry and
his brother, and we like him the better because these
were his countrymen. But this does not mean that
we are going to jump into his lap, or fence in ground
pressed by his foot or darkened by his shadow. His
coming and his going will have social and not politi
cal significance. In his youth we entertained his royal
uncle, now Edward VII of England, and danced
with him and showed him our best, and remained
Americans. We do not lose our heads about these
royal visits, and our heads are in less danger of
being lost than ever.
The New York Chamber of Commerce has de
clared for reciprocity, and it might as well, have de
clared for free trade. The New Yorkers, in fact, are
not particular about American industry. So long as
they can handle all imports they are ,all right.
THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION.
SENATOR HOAR'S resolution calling for the
appointment of a committee to inquire into the
situation in the Philippines and to report the
Â¦wiiole truth to the Senate gives promise that at last
we shall have sufficient light upon the subject to un
derstand the contradictions that appear in the re
ports of the civil authorities in the islands when com
pared with those of the military authorities. Accord
ing to one set of officials " the Filipinos are rapidly
becoming reconciled to our government, while ac
cording to the other they are as hostile as ever and
will require stringent military government for years
to come. There is doubtless a means of determining
which of these divergent "views is the more accurate,
and no better way of arriving at that determination
can be devised than that which Senator Hoar pro
poses.
As matters stand we know hardly as much about
the situation in the Philippines as we do about that
in the Transvaal. The islands are far away and the
majority of Americans are more or less indifferent to
the problems involved in their government. Con
sequently it is only when some notable disaster
occurs to an American troop that we pay much at
tention to what is going on there. It appears, how
ever, from a report of General Bell,. just published
by the War Department, that the condition of affairs
in Batangas province is decidedly serious, whatever
it may be elsewhere. According to that report the
General has found that lenient treatment of the na
tives produces no good results and has decided upon
another plan, which includes a "reconcentration"
policy and a drastic prosecution of war against all
outside the "zones" in which the friendly inhabitants
are to be gathered.
The Hoar resolution was referred to the Philippine
committee, of which Senator Lodge is chairman.
That course was taken because Mr. Lodge declared
that to deal with it otherwise would be a reflection
upon himself and upon his committee. Under such
circumstances the committee can hardly fail to take
action and enter upon an investigation which will
bring to light the whole truth of the situation.
In urging his resolution Senator Hoar reverted to
the statement of General Otis that 40,000 troops
would have to be maintained in the Philippines for
a considerable period, and noted that at the time it
was received with incredulity by some members of
the Senate. It proved, however, to be an under
estimate, for, as the Senator went on to say, we have
now 70,000 men in the islands and are expending
from $75,000,000 to $100,000,000 annually to maintain
them there. He estimated the total cost of the^roup
to us up to this time at about $500,000,000, and
rightly claimed that we ought to know what progress
we have made during the years of our government
and what we have gained for our money.
Whatever differences of opinion may exist con
cerning the anti-imperialist opinions of Senator
Hoar, therejCan be none with respect to his request
for more light on the subject. There are many
problems of Philippine legislation to be dealt with
by this Congress, and it will be 'able to deal 1 with
them more wisely by having before it the truth and
the whole truth concerning the. military situation.
Reports that Senator Platt of New York is threat
ened with paralysis may not be strictly true, but the
fact that New York politicians are discussing who
shall be his successor is convincing proof that the
old man is not as vigorous as he was.
All the talk about New York's Four Hundred will
have to stop, for according to reports there were 500
persons present at the latest Astor ball, and of
course whoever Mrs. Astor entertains is part of the
social cream. .-Â¦--â¢-.
Another striking illustration of the truth' of the
thought that the leading passion is strong in death
has been given to the American public. c William

The Alameda County Jail would be. an excellent

PENNSYLVANIA'S appeal to the States .'to'
unite in'a call for a constitutional convention
is being slowly responded to: ' Michigan, Colo
rado, Montana, Oregon, Idaho and Nevada are re
ported to have officially 1 notified Congress through
their Legislatures that they desire a convention
called for the purpose of amending the constitution.
A resolution to the like effect is pending in the Mas
sachusetts Legislature, while Louisiana has adopted
a memorial asking Congress for the; repeal of the
fifteenth amendment. ]Â¦Â£&%*,
These applications to -Congress are made under
article V of the constitution, which provides 'triar
Congress "on application of the Legislatures of two
thirds of the States shall'call a convention for pro
posing amendments which * * * shall be valid
to all intents and purposes as part of this constitu
tion when ratified by the Legislatures, of three
fourths of the several States, or by conventions in
three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode
of ratification may be proposed by the Congress."
The Pennsylvania movement for a national consti
tutional convention was undertaken because of ' the
failure of every attempt to carry through the United
States Senate a constitutional amendment providing
for the election of United States Senators by direct
vote of the people. It will be remembered "that a
few years ago there was a long series of scandals and
deadlocks in connection with the election of United
States Senators, and that out of them arose a clamor
for .reform. , Every attempt to effect a reform was,
however, defeated - by ' the . Senate itself, and there
upon the Pennsylvanian plan' wasmndertaken. That
only six States have thus' far responded may be
taken as good evidence that it will fail.' It may be
easier after all to get the Senate to consent to be
reformed than to get two-thirds of the'States to call
for a national convention which might undertake a
good deal more than is desired.
There. is a strong feeling that the public welfare
can be promoted by amending, the. constitution in
many ways. It is believed, for example, that a com
prehensive scheme of irrigation cannot be carried out

ST. LOUIS, Jan. a.â William H. Hoff
meister of St. Louis, ex-supreme recorder
of the Legion of Honor, committed sui
cide at the Planters' Hotel to-day by
shooting himself with a revolver. The
only witness to the suicide was George
M. Ackley of Kansas City.
Hoffmelster was defeated last night for
re-election as supreme recorder of the
Legion of Honor by C. R. T. White, and
an entirely new supreme council was
elected after a sensational contest. One
feature of the struggle was the arrest of
otto R Overbeck, candidate for supreme
chancellor and leader of the opposition
vo the administration, as he was entering
the Holland building on nis way to the
meeting where the election was to be
held. At the Four Courts a complaint
was lodged against Overbeck for carry
ing a concealed weapon. Friends pro
cured Overbeck's release on bond and
hurried with him to the meeting r hall,
where they arrived in time to vote, his
one vote being necessary to win. â¢
George M. Ackley of Kansas City, for
mer supreme overseer of the Legion of
Honor, who shared the room with Hoff
meister last night, stated that he was in
the bathroom adjoining the sleeping
apartment when Hoffmeister shot him
self with Ackley' s revolver. Ackley said
that Hoffmeister killed himself, as he
believed, because he was defeated in his
candidacy for re-election to the office of
supreme recorder.
"Hoffmeister was drinking last night,"
eaid Ackley, "and he told me there would
be trouble. I knew he had a "revolver and
I took it from him and locked it up. My
own revolver was in my valise, and It
was the weapon with which he shot him
self."
George W. Teasdale, an intimate friend
cf the dead man, said:
*'I wish to contradict a rumor which
has already become current relating to
Hoffmeister's accounts. His accounts
were investigated by the executive com
mittee and the auditing committee of the
council and were found to be in good
shape."
After hearing the testimony of Ackley
and Teasdale and S. L. Barnard, the Cor
oner rendered a verdict of suicide. Hoff
meister was 40 years old. He had held
the office of supreme recorder of the or
der for thirteen years. His wife is at
present in New York City, where she Is

HONOLULU. H. T.. Jan. 15.â An inter
esting fight between local stockholders in
the First National Bank of Hawaii and
the Anglo-California holders of San Fran
cisco, backed by the Seligmans of New
York, developed at the annual meeting of
the stockholders of the bank yesterday.
The representatives of the SÂ£n Francisco
stockholders, backed by a few shares. of
local stock, were in favor of a change in
the management of the bank, desiring a
new president In place of Cecil Brown.
The action of President Brown in' ruling
out all the outside proxies may Invalidate
the proceedings.
Colonel G. \V. Macfarlane, who came
here with the proxies from. San Fran
cisco, and his supporters had 2292 shares
of stock out of 5000, while Cecil Brown's
supporters mustered 2105. Brown ruled
out all the 2292 i shares on- the ground that
they were not stamped with the internal
revenue tax stamp required by the act of
1898. To-day attention was called to the
fact that the tax -on proxies was repealed
last March, and now it is claimed that
Macfarlane and the others had a right to
vote their proxies. '
As an additional ground for not allow
ing the proxies to be voted Brown de
clared that they were not properly made
out, one alleged defect being that they
did not specify the date of the meeting
at which they were to be voted. -â¢ ,j
- With the proxies all ruled out, the meet-
Ing proceeded and the old board of direct
ors was re-elected. This would mean the
re-election of Brown as president and
continuance of the present management
but a protest was entered by Macfarlane
at the meeting, and this morning, sinco
attention was called to the fact that the
tax had been repealed, it is claimed that
a new meeting will have to be held Un
less an agreement is made to hold a new
meeting th* courts will be asked to set
the proceedings of yesterday aside and
require a new election.
Colonel Macfarlane states that he want
ed to vote his stock and proxies for a
postponement of thirty days, in which a
new man for president might be selected.
Brown being declared to be unsatisfac
tory to the San Francisco and New York
interests He states that a local man is
wanted, but that, if an agreement satis
factory to all cannot be made upon some
Honolulu man, he will favor bringing a
national bank man from the mainland.

Reception to Governor Taft.
"Under our present method of civil gov
ernment we have too systems, the munici
pal and the provincial. Bach province has
a Governor, who Is elected by the Coun
cilors of the province. In each province
there is also a treasurer and a supervisor
of road3 and improvements, both of whom
are Americans. We also have a Prose
cuting Attorney and a secretary, but
they are natives. The great trouble with
the native officer Is that the moment he
goes into office he thinks it part of his
duties to terrorize his friends. The Fil
ipino is to a certain extent deceitful. He
will not say anything to your face to of
fend you, but behind your back he Is
merciless in his denunciations. Another
peculiar trait in him is that if he has a
falling out with another- native lie will
attempt to take the matter into the courts
and make a criminal action of It. He
seems to think that every little trouble
must be ventilated in the courts."
"The civil government adopted" a tariff
schedule which is working well, but our
internal revenue receipts are not large.
When you tax a country too heavily you
spoil it, and that is the situation in the
Philippines. You must remember that tne

equipped it will be detailed in the field to

dating the natives. These Filipino con-
Btattles can be maintained by the Gov
ernment at a cost of.J250each a year,
while the soldiers in the islands cost
Uncle Sam about $1000 a head. In' refer
ence to the friars holding property In the
islands and the question as to whether the
United States Government should buy
their land, Governor Taft said:
"To thoroughly understand this ques
tion you must go back to the time when
the Spanish Government secured posses
sion of the islands. The Catholic church
went to the islands with' the Spanish Gov
ernment and it has accomplished great
work in converting the Filipinos to Chris
tianity. - The natives dislike certain re
ligious orders In the islands, but that is
simply because the friars, being loyal to
Spain, governed them as well as attended
to their spiritual wants. The priests were
responsible to the Spanish Government
for order end they maintained it. The
Filipino is devoted to the Catholic church,
but, as I saJd before, he dislikes certain
of the orders. A bill is now pending be
fore Congress to buy the land holdings of
the church. If the Government acquires
the property It will sell it to the natives
who are now tenants on the land. The
land will- be sold at a nominal -price and
the natives allowed to pay for it in easy
installments.

You must remember that only 10 per cent

what constitutes real liberty. They are

"The report that there is friction be

the law," said he, "is entirely incorrect.
We have an understanding in regard to
the detention of military prisoners.
Should a person In . the islands commit
an act that necessitates an arrest by the
army authorities, a general or other
high-ranking officer reports to the civil
authorities that such person is under de
tention-for breaking the military law. In
case of treason or offenses of that na

PHILIPPINE NATIVES PERFORM
EFFICIENT CONSTABULARY DUTY
CUSTOM-HOUSE
EMPLOYES OUT
Laborers and Assistant
Weighers Are Dis
charged;
Probability That an Extra
Deputy Collector Will
Be Appointed.
A large number of , unexpected changes
took place In the Custom-house yester
day.. These changes are based upon the
investigation" made recently by Special
Agents "West and Channing. .The most
important of the changes is the abolition
of the position of private .secretary to the
Collector of Customs, a ""sinecure -which
has cost the Government $2000 per annum.
The position has been held by John P.
Jackson Jr., who attended faithfully to
whatever work he was called upon to
perform. The salary of Charles Reynolds,
clerk, has been increased to $1800 from
51500. . "William E." Rowlan takes the place
left .vacant by the appointment of Rey
nolds and receives $1400 instead of $1200â
the old salary. The force of -eight assist
ant weighers has been reduced to four.
This reduction will enable the four as
sistants to be busy all the time, they be
ing paid only for the hours that they are
actually employed. Fifteen laborers of
the force of fifty-five have been dropped.
The title of George B. Edgar's position
has been changed to that of clerk and
messenger. The position of messenger In
the Appraiser's office, held by Clyde
Westover, has been abolished and Clyde
has been promoted. â¢
Collector Stratton said yesterday that
several new offices had been created In
the Custom-house and that In consequence
the expenses will be larger than ever, as
the receipts are now larger than ever be
fore and the business has increased pro
portionately. These details -will be
made public by the Collector within a
week or ten days. He will announce his
appointments, including that for the po
sition held by the late E. B. Jerome.
It was learned from another source that
it is likely that the position of chief clerk,
recently held by Mr. Jerome, will be abol
ished, that the duties of that office will
be performed by a special deputy collect
or and that the desk in the Custom-house
occupied by Special Deputy William B.
Hamilton will be filled by the appointment
of an additional deputy collector, for
which position Colonel Craig is promi
nently mentioned. There is only one
deputy collector at present in the Cus
tom-house, Newton S. Farley, whereas up
to a few years ago and before the begin
ning of the war with Spain there had
been two, the other being Lieutenant Col
onel John J. Tobln. Tobin being a Demo
crat/' a deal was made by Customs Col
lector Jackson and E. B. Jerome whereby
the mantle of civil service protection was
whisked oft Colonel Tobln's shoulders and
the vacancy filled by the appointment of
Stanley Jackson as special deputy. It is
the opinion of the majority of the brokers
doing business in the Custom-house that
two regular civil service deputies are
needed on the floor to facilitate the busi-
MBS. CLARA KLUGE-SUTRO
ACCEPTS THE COMPROMISE
Files a Dismissal of the Contests In
stituted by Her Against the
Sutro Will. .
The official dismissal of the contests of
the will of the late Adolph Sutro by Mrs.
Clara Kluge-Sutro was filed In the office
of the County # Clerk yesterday, thus end-
Ing what promised to be a long-drawn-out
legal battle for the wealth of the de
ceased philanthropist. Mrs. Clara Kluge-
Sutro filed two contests, one on her own
behalf and the other a3 guardian of her
two children. Mrs. . Dr. Merritt and
Charles Sutro, children of the deceased,
offered her $100,000 as a compromise, and
the document filed yesterday officially an
nounced the acceptance of the offer.
There is still another contest pending.
Mrs. Kose Morblo, another daughter of
Sutro, is contesting the will on the ground
that in 18S2, Â«when ' it was executed, her
father was of unsound mind. The trial
was to have commenced In the Probate
Court yesterday, but Alfred Sutro, . who
represents certain legatees, objected to the
proceeding because he had not yet filed
an answer on behalf of his clients. The
trial was then set for February 4.

In its hotels and other public places are
to be found glittering collections of min
erals, attesting to the richness of the
county's lodes and placers, the whole be
ing sufficient to outfit mining museums
with specimens. In the heart of the town
on a main street, the workings of a quits
recent mining enterprise are in evidence"

considering that it abuts on flower gar-
There is no man in El Dorado County
Â¦who has a right to complaint of the price
of roofing when he can go out with a
drill, a little blasting powder, a few chis
els and a cart, and make for himself in
a day enough shingles of slate with which
to cover the top and sides of his house
The slate outcroppings appear on the tops
of high hills. In the deep depression of
the canyon through which runs the south
fork of the American River, in ledges on
tlie farther side of the American River
in deposits by the country roads, where
al! may get slate for the gathering of it.
It is good, stout stuff, withstanding suc
cessfully the weather's attacks for ages
Some of it is fine in texture and hard as
adamant, although easily split; other de
posits are soft and can be crumbled be
tween the fingers.
The commercial aspect of the El Do
lti% t P ?^%^ th ! bright Prognostica
tions of the El Dorado people about their
future Justified the sending of -a repre
sentative of The Call to view Placerville
and the surrounding country for the pur
pose of securing reliable information for
the public. Placerville is the leader of El
Dorado enterprise, lying in a favorable
position among the foothills of the Sierra
Nevada at the end of the first railroad
ever constructed in California and look
ing forward to the time when some trans
continental line shall be constructed
through it and so bring It Into immediate
touch with the great country lying east
of the mountains.
Huge Array of Slates.
These facts are but just becoming gen
erally known. The first and natural re
sult of such knowledge is that capital is
being attracted to El Dorado and people
in the East, who have rested secure in
the va!n belief that they had for all time
a monopoly of the slate trade of this
coast, are casting eyes in this direction.
Already one company that has been
launched has the aid of capital from Penn
sylvania, in which State there are vast
slate inQustries. The significance of this
will not be lost. Oddly enough, while it
has been known in El Dorado County for
a long period that elate abounded there,
efforts to utilize the supply have never
bfen vigorously pushed, at least not on
a. scale of energy comparable to that be
stowed upon gold mining or fruit raising,
until very recently. Even now slate pro
duction, considering the possibilities in
plain view for the immediate future, may
be raid to be only in its infancy, but it is
a stout and sturdy infant that will be
heard from yet very strongly.
First cousins are the slates, shales and
schists. In the far off Cambrian, Silurian
and Devonian periods of the world's his
tory slate was deposited on ocean floors
as fine mud and was ' afterward, com
pressed into hard rock. Then, in some of
the eccentric motions of the earth's sur
lace, before political slates were known
or dreamed of by the monstroils animal
life of those dim days of early time, slate
beds were tilted up and appeared as out
croppings of blue, green, purple, gray and
blac-K argillaceous rocks, having a peculiar
structure, by reason of which the slate
readily splits into tbin plates or laminae.
K.ind Nature, doing so much for Califor
nia, when it vras passing around gold, cli
mate and scenery, was not niggardly
when it came to throwing a due allowance
of slate to the future Golden State. There
is enough material so provided in El Do
rado County to roof the world.
California, prospects of
rreat wealth for the historic old county of
El Dorado, in the comparatively new in
dustry of slate quarrying, are brought to
view. The county is rich in mines, lum
ber, fruit and in the capacity of producing
electric po.wer by the harnessing of swift
running mountain streams. Now slate Is
forging to the front and it puts forth the
proud claim that El Dorado County has a
monopoly of all the slate deposits of the
vast region west of the Missouri River in
the United States. Therefore millions
may be reaped in a comparatively new
California field.

There is this radical difference between
slate quarrying and quartz mining for
gold or other metals: The slate manifests
itself above ground and extends down

whereas the gold quartz is more uncer

From this episode the more recent ex
ploiters of the El Dorado County slates
have taken counsel and have sought more
eligible sites, where their industry need
not be suspended for any visible cause.
As the gold industry has to a very large
extent gone from the river courses of
California to the mountains and hillsides,
so, but for different reasons, has the
more modern elate enterprise. |
As with so many other industries in Cal
ifornia, that of slate producing has al
ready passed through the period of ex
periment. From the mistakes af the past
the fruit producers of California, the min
ers and other classes of citizens prepar
ing products for the market have arrived
at an understanding of the circumstances
and requirements that attend them as
they toil. Where the south fork of the
American River hurries along over ita
gravels that once were rich with gold at
Chile bar were the original slate quarries
of the State. To say the truth, these de
posits are abandoned. By the banks of
the river are piled up . large masses of
slate, the detritus of earlier quarryings,
the moraines of toll. No one doubts that
the slate at Chile bar is good, but there
was no dumping ground for the refuse.
In front of the operators stood, the re
straining influence of the" California.De
bris.Commission, which would not permit
the American River to be filled up. That
stopped the quarrying there.
Experimental Stage Passed.

Through the streets of Placerville, at in
tervals, resound the booming noises that
tell of blasting in the hills, where the
populace seeks for precious metals, or
slate or other mineral substance. Down
its main thoroughfare heavily loaded
carts, drawn by four horses, go carrying
loads of slate quarried out in the hills be

The topography of the county Is such that
water can be carried to every part of it. In
fact a plentiful supply of water Is carried to
all sections on the line of the mother lode by
three great ditch systems on the three great
ridges or divides within the county â the sys
tem of the California Water Company on the
north divide, the El Dorado Water and Deep
Gravel Mining Company's system on the mid
dle and the Diamond Ridge or Park Canal sys
tem on the south divide.
Another close observer of the affairs of
the county is W. E. Mackenzie, editor of
the Placerville Nugget, who has written
the following review of the existing con
ditions in El Dorado for The Call by re
quest:
A . review of the resources of El Dorado
County at this point in its history must include
three factors which are at present prominent
and of Increasing Importance In the develop
ment of the State of California â mining, lum
bering and the generating of electric power to
be transmitted to the cities and Industrial cen
ters of the State. ,This county shares with the
State at large the present hopeful outlook.
First among her industries ranks â¢ mining.
Her , mines are still immense storehouses of
fortune to which the pick' and driU of the
miner, backed by enterprise and modern equip
ment, are the keys. Much successful work has
been done recently in the mines which have
already produced millions upon millions of dol
lars. â¢ -V " ..< . ; Â¦
. Vast belts of timber, the finest of Its kind in
the world, are- now Â¦ being developed by enter
prising lumber companies, and the past year
has witnessed the construction of a lumber
cable 180O feet high across the American River
ble3 by | sailing vessels . from the East.
After a' time he , began to explore Cali
fornia for slate and visited many coun
ties in that quest. He made his first dis
covery, in 18Â»7. . Subsequently: his enter
prise, was rewarded by finding other de
posits of large size, all of which were in
El Dcrado . County. He discovered tho
deposits at Kelsey * that- are now * being
worked by the â¢ Eureka Slate Company,
and he quarried there for a time. He had
not the capital to carry on the business
upon . a . large scale. Before the - railroad
was constructed from Shingle Springs | to
Placerville he Â¦ had satisfied himself that
there was enough, slate' in El Dorado
County to "make the exploitation of ; it a
good investment, : and . it -was largely
through his representations that the rail
road : line 'was continued on " to Placer
ville.- Mr. Strahle - worked,, the Kelsey
quarry/ and then sold out his interest in
the property to : William J.- Dingee. He
has an in another tract where
there ;Â¦ is slate. , In , the course of his op
erations he caused samples of slate from
all parts of the f world where there are
producing quarries . to . be gathered for
inspection, â¢. and competent judges re
ported' that. El Dorado had . Â¦ as
fine an article; as -could be: found any
where. . Strahle still: lives near .Kelsey.

I The machinery of the slate quarries of
El Dorado County is quite simple. The
California Company brings up the quarried
slate from the bottom of tlje. present
workings upon a tramway that is ope
rated by water. Simply by gravitation, an
iron tank' on wheels, when filled with
water, hauls up the inclined tracks a large
load of slate, on the tram.

The only other machinery that is in use
now applies to ' the cutting of , slate after
it is pried Â¦ off Into â¢ the proper sizes for
use in roofing. This is effected by a ma
chine : provided with a sort of knife,, or
straight steel | edge,- which, being forced

men, chops off the edges straight. That

There are two slate quarries in El Do
rado County that are in active operation.
The nearest of these to the tracks of tho
Southern Pacific Company is the â¢ one
owned by the California Slate Company,
of which F. S. Chadbourne, formerly
State Harbor Commissioner, is the gen
eral manager. This is On the very edge
of Placerville, situated upon a hill above
the city, and not more than a mile dis
tant. The other is the property of the
Eureka Slate Company. That is at Kel
sey, several miles from Placerville and
separated from it by high ranges of hill3
and the deep canyon of the south fork of
the American River. William J. Dingee
is the president of the Eureka" Slate Com
pany. Expert slate workers ] have . been
brought from abroad by both of the com
panies, David Williams, who was a slate
quarryman in Wales and also in Penn
sylvania; is the foreman of the Califor
nia slate quarry, and John Wlnsboro is
watching the work at the Eureka quarry
and directing it. ' The Eureka Company

with this is the consideration of the com

fornia Company. Chile Bar lies not less
than 1200 feet lower than the top of the
California quarry. Therefore, it Is sup
posed that the California deposit is 100J
feet deep.. When the operations are push
ed downward the outward semblance to
the aspect of the Palisades will be even
more striking than it Is now. , . v ' "â¢" ;
The deposit of slate at the works of the
Eureka State Company's plant- at Kelsey
is, seemingly, as extensive as that of the
California Company. The hoisting works
of the machinery at Kelsey takes the
slate that is being quarried out: at- the
bottom of a canyon to the top of a' high
hill, which is apparently all: slate of va
rious colors, textures . and degrees of
hardness. At either of the quarries men
tioned there is enough material to .keep
large forces at work for many years and
the surrounding hills have other prospects
that are probably as vast. Â¦ Consequently,
it would seem that El Dorado County not
only has enough wealth in slate to suffice
for the immediate future.but that also,
as in a store house of incalculable size,
there is sufficient to satisfy the demands
of the world for an indefinite period. v
THE significance of the new industry of El Dorado County is that in the quarries / of that county is all the marketable slate known to exist west of the Mis
souri, River. This gives the county a sure market for a vast area, and -adds a material source of. wealth to, the region made historic by Marshall and hi3
sturdy compeers, who flocked to the vicinity where he picked up the first California nugget. But not alone on gold and slate does El Dorado depend
for her prosperity. Nature has conferred upon her many resources which promise greater treasures than even the glittering past can boast. The views of
the editors of El Dorado outline satisfactorily the bases upon which El Dorado builds her not unreasonable hopes for advancement. They are apparent to all men.
Great water power, broad timber belts and fruit production enrich the county rarely.

Now any one who views the works of
the modern slate companies does not
have to take the word of anybody to see
that they have selected sites that save
them from encountering the difficulties
that effectually tied up their predeces
sors. Both of the slate quarries named
in the foregoing are situated upon hills
and there are deep canyons below that
will not' be filled up in a century by all
the debris that they will cast out. The
hills stand up sheer and tall and the land
slopes away for long distances. By rea
son of such location the neighborhood of
the quarries is not devoid of picturesque
suggestions.

When slate is standing perpendicularly
in The quarry it is a very easy matter to
detach it from- the mass. It is brought
down in slabs varying from six inches to
one foot in thickness. When it is green,
that is before the moisture has had a
chance to dry out, it is worked very eas
ily and wi.nput splitting at unexpected
places. The â¢ quarryman breaks it open
with steel chisels that are of varying
thickness, but all quite thin. The thinnest
chisel is, naturally," used to pry off a very
thin layer and a thicker chisel for a
stratum of greater thickness.
The operation of detaching Â«the roofing
slate from the slab to make it fit for mar
keting really amounts to little more than
prying It off. The treatment of stone is
precisely such' as is given to wood that
is to be taken from a block by wedges.
Slate is elastic and successive chisels, in
serted at various places, take off layers
without breaking them into small frag
ments and produce slates of the requisite
in symmetrical arrangements, ready for
shipment to San Francisco and other
points, where it is needed for roofing.
There are thousands- of pieces of slate
that have been . chipped down to the
requisite thickness and dimensions to be
used for roofs, that are gazed at by stran
gers who visit Placerville and that hold
the promise of a coming great industry
of the county of El Dorado. Some of the
slate is gray, but the supply of that color
is relatively small in proportion to the
whole of the deposits. The great bulk is
dark-colored, - such as - is found on the
roofs of public bufldings.

The diversion of the railroad from the
line originally contemplated by the con
structors of the road over the Sierras to
connect with the Union -Pacific has not de
prived Placerville of the advantages of
being a distributing point for a consider
able section. Teams carry out freights to
the adjoining country in the favorable
season. From Placerville a stage' line
runs to Lake Tahoe and other stages con
nect with points nearer at - hand. It is
still a pleasure for many Californians to
go to Placerville and stage It over the
high Sierras to Tahoe, the distance bein<
only sixty-five miles, which is easily cov
ered I in a day by making an early start
from either end of the line. Here are the

There are many miners prospecting in
the canyons of El Dorado. The mines
that are being actively operated embrace
the Larkin. which is situated on the
mother lode, three miles south from Pla
cerville; the River Hill mine, formerly
known as the Gentle Annie, on the edge
of Placerville, where from forty to fifty
men are steadily employed; the Pyramid
mine, on Dry Creek, near the Junction
with "Webber Creek; the Vandalla, four
miles south from Shingle Springs at
Canyon; the St. Clair jnine at Kelsey; the
Starlight mine at about two miles from
El Dorado; the South Slope mine, at the
head of Onion Valley, near Eleven Pines,
and about thirty miles from Placerville;
the Golconda quartz mine in the Pilot
Knob mining district, and the copper
mines Cambrian, Noonday, Little Emma
and Ford, which are on the copper forma
tion that lies west of the mother lode.
Miners Are Active.
In these utterances of the editors of the
Placerville papers are very thoroughly
shadowed forth the reasons for the be
lief in the future of the old empire
county. -.- , |if s
A few years ago El Dorado was the empire
county of California, and in a review of the
big projects that are coming her way now
there is promise of restoration to her former
position. Her mines and quarries, timber belts
and" water power are most inviting' fields for
capital and enterprise.
and a lumber railway which taps the timber
belt.
Second, the mountain streams and lakes arÂ«
becoming a valuable resource of the county.
Capital 13 preparing here, as elsewhere, to
harness the snow-fed mountain torrent to the
wheel3 of industry. Several electric power
companies have plans matured for power
plants In this county and some work has al
ready baen done toward utilizing the water of
Silver Fork and Wrights Lake.
El Dorado County also contains the only
two slate quarries west of the Mississippi.
These produce first quality alate. the quantity
of which is practically unlimited.
Large deposits of limestone, capable of be
ing manufactured into a high-grade of Port
land cement, are found within a few miles
of Placerville. Their development waits only
upon transportation problems.
The construction of a transcontinental rail
way through El Dorado County has been a
possibility for many years. At present Indi
cations point with reasonable certainty to Its
construction in the near future. Increasing
travel has so congested traffic on the Central
Pacific between Sacramento and Reno as to
render necessary either a double track system
over the mountains or the building 1 of a new
road with easier grades and less snowsheds.
The Southern Pacific has recently surveyed a
route through Placerville across the mountains
which will reduce the grade about 400Q feet
and obviate the necessity of maintaining snow
sheds, besides shortening the route over forty
miles. Under these circumstances the con
struction of the road is almost an assured fact.

THE Orientals gave their first dance
of the season last evening at Gold
en Gate Hall. The color scheme
for decoration was principally
pale blue with festoons of white
and green; The hallwas thronged with
ladies and gentlemen in elaborate evening
dress. The members of the club were
distinguished by the Oriental fezze3
which they wore. The cotillon was a most
enjoyable one, with music' furnished " by
Hynes. The dancing continued until mid
night. ,!
The members of the club who had the
dance In charge comprise: Messrs. Harry

\AJ1 day yesterday the commission ap
pointed to consider the acquirement by
the State of a park in the Big Basin in
Santa Cruz County sat in conference In
the Palace Hotel, attended" by the mem
bers of the advisory I committee. Gover
nor Qage presided. There 1 was a full at
tendance, the only, absentee being Gen
eral N. -P. -VChlpman. '- Seemingly the
representations recently made to in
duce the commission to take Immediate
action In purchasing the lands offered by
the Big Basin Lumber Company at the
rate of $100 per acre had no effect.. - The
sessions, forenoon and. afternoon, -were
held with closed doors. Many matters
connected with the proposed park were
discussed. Maps were reviewed and. the
question of making' certain that the park
be insured 'a complete water supply -by
Including the south fork of Waddeli
Creek and enough of the drainage basin
for park purposes i was additionally con
sidered, in the discussions of the day
other topics . of collateral interest came
up, but no vote was adopted to purchase
the tract offered by the Big Basin L,um-,
ber Company at llUu per aero or any otner
prlce.
The commission will not send any word
to the convention that meets to-morrow
at San Jose concerning its present atti
tude. Two members of the commission
reside in Santa Clara Countyâ the " Rev.
Father Kenna and Professor Dudley of
Stanford University. The convention may
possibly learn something from them. Pro
fessor Dudley is the>secretary of the com
mission. At the close. of tho sessions yes
terday afternoon he and Governor Gage,
who were together In the meeting room,
absolutely refused to furnish any inform
ation for publication. â¢ The statement that
no decision to buy the park was reached
comes from, such a reliable source that
the accuracy of it cannot be well doubted.
At this time the commission is going
steadily ahead In the line of acquiring a
park, but It does not appear that It will
be hurried into doing anything that does
not commend itself to the judgment- of
the members. The commission has the
power to. institute condemnation proceed
ings for such lands as may., be selected
for the park and need not pay an ex
orbitant price for the same. Â¦
The fact Is admitted by the Commis
sioners that an important resolution was
adopted at the session, but it' was deemed
advisable by the commission to withhold
It from the public for business reasons, j
About three years ago a cesspool in the
college grounds was made the subject of
complaint to the Board of Health by resi
dents in the vicinity, who declared it to
be a nuisance. The laying of sewers In
that district resulted in the remedying of
the evil and since that time the adjoining
property-holders have been silent. While
the untidy appearance of the college
grounds excites comment, no one Is will-
Ing to assert that a nuisance Is being
maintained. Drs. Williamson and Lewitt
of the Beard of Health are members of
the college faculty.
Dr. A. A. d'Ancona, dean of the Af
filiated Colleges, admitted yesterday that
the condition of the grounds was
not what it should be. but he
added that improvements could not
be made heretofore owing to the dif
ficulty cf securing an appropriation from
the Legislature for the purpose. He esti
mated that at least $15,060 would be re
quired to make the place thoroughly pre
sentable. He said further that he was in
favor of making the improvements and
that he would do all in his power to bring
order out of chaos.
Improvements "Will Be Costly.
With every rain the hollows at the
foot of the grounds Immediately bordering
upon Parnassus avenue are filled wun
water and present an intolerably dreary
spectacle. These declivities are spanned
by two narrow footbridges, just wide
enough for two slender people to walk
abreast thereon. On either side the vista
is one of an unbroken sea of yellow mud,
which has been a menace Â«.o students for
four winters past. That the rough slope
fronting the buildings should be leveled,
graded and sown with grass or macadam
ized is conspicuously apparent to every
beholder. That the Regents will be asked
to do all In their power to forward the
necessary improvements Is a certainty.
Toward the west end of tho campus an
unsightly dumping ground, which has evi
dently been In dally use for some time,
offends the taste. This process of tiling
in the land, which is broken by numerous
hollows of greater or less depth, may be
practical, but in the opinion of all who
have beheld the spectacle it does not add
to the beauty of the surroundings. Just
Â¦what to do with the garbage materials
Â¦which accumulate In the colleges has been
a source of worry to the olficiaJs in charge
and no disposition other than that men
tioned seems possible. They cannot be
6ecreted from view in the rear, owing to
the fact that the buildings stand almost
against the hillside, from which the build-
Ing site was scooped out, so to speak. But
whether the present casting of the gar
bage almost at the front doors of the
buildings thenisel\-.es is to be longer tole
rated is a question which the Regents will
soon be called upon to decide.
Campus a Dumping Ground.
Ever since the buildings were erected
in 1S97 the premises have been neglected.
The site of the colleges is on a grrand emi
nence from which a delightful view of
the ocean, bay and country beyond Is to
be had. Tne site was donated by the late
Adolph Sutro, but the buildings were
erected by, the State. The expense of all
improvements therefore fell upon the
State, a proposition which has consistent
ly t>een ignored by the Legislatures This
xnonxh the property passed under the con
trol of the University Regents and the
gentlemen composing that body may. soon
take 6teps to beautify the premises on a
scale comm.iinsura.te with the imposing
dignity of the magnificent buildings,
â¢whose architectural beauties languish
ainld their unsightly surroundings.
A first view of the grounds as one ap
proaches them from the east Is not satis
fying. On the contrary, it is decidedly
offensive. The slope of the eminence,
â¢which Is crowned- by the stately buildings,
le ragged, broken and covered with the ac
cumulatlons of years. The presence of
weeds In. the luxuriance of uninterrupted
growth, amid which broken bottles, paper
bags and other debris are plainly visible,
does not Inspire the casual visitor with
confidence in the enterprise of the guard
ians of the property.
The campus of the Affiliated Colleges on
Parnassus avenue, covered as it is with
weeds, bits of paper, ashheaps and other
material more or less objectionable to an
esthetic taste, is tlie subject of much un
favorable comment and it Is not unlikely
that the University Regents, who now
control the* property, .-will be petitioned
to transf orm. a veritable eyesore into a
epot of beauty.

Once More Recounts
How She Met Mil
lionaire Blythe.
Appears to Support Hiram
Unruh's Claim to the- 'Â¦]
Famous Estate.
"I think It tvas In JÂ£75. I was a school
girl, attending the Placerville Seminary.
I saw Mr. Blythe very often before i I
made his acquaintance. " He was a fine
looking- man, and attracted my attention
as I went to and from the school. One
day he tipped his hat to me and bowed.
That is how I first met Mr. Blythe. 1 '
Such was the reply of Alice Edith Dick
ason to a question asked her' yesterday:
in Judge Hunt's court, where the* suit : of
Hiram Unruh, who has commenced pro
ceedings to recover the estate of the late
millionaire, how In the possession of Mrs. '
Florence JtJlythe-Hinekiey-Moore, is be
ins heard. Â¦ â¢
, LJnruh claims the property/ which after
years of litigation was given "to Mrs.
Moore, on- conveyances made by -the- al
leged widow during the progress of tne
long legal proceedings which iohowed the
tiling of l'lorence Jttlythe's claim. .ite
says "Alice Edith" gave him the deeds
as security for loans ho made her to en
able her to carry on the legal contest.
This is the first appearance in court of
the alleged widow since the termination
of the suit. She is the same "Alice
Edith'," apparently, but added years and
her manner of living have left their
traces. She Is 40 years- of age, but looked
scarcely 30 yesterday -when she tripped
lightly to the witness chair. . The presr
ence of a nurse In the courtroom ex
plained her natty appearance. She has
been under a doctor's care for some time,
and every effort is being made by the
medical man and Unruh's attorneys to
keep her in condition for the struggle
which Is once more to- be made 'for the
Blythe millions. *. . (
The attorneys -for Mrs. Moore sought to
prevent the present legal battle by In
troducing in evidence the decision of the
Superior Court, subsequently confirmed
by the Supreme Court, which declared
that "Alice Edith" had no claim on the
Blythe estate. Judge Hunt, however, de
cided that the plaintiff was entitled to
"a day in court," and when he announced
his decision Mrs. Dickason, who up to
that time had sat quietly by the side of
her nurse, was summoned to the stand.
Attorney Baggett, .who represents Un
ruh, asked her but three questions, each
of which related to her connection with
Blythe, and \ then said to the attorneys
for Mrs. Moore:
-"Take the witness."
Mrs. Dlckason remained on the witness
stand for several hours under a cross
examination which, owing to the shrewd
questions of her attorney when she was
first placed on the stand, could only re
late to her relations with the deceased
millionaire. â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦ . . - Â¦ , .
She gave the same testimony practically
that she gave in the famous trial. She
told h6w she first met Blythe, of her sub
sequent marriage in Oakland to F. L. Pe
ters, and the separation and divorce
which followed. She told how Blythe met
her after she was freed from Peters and
of the furnishing of a cottage for her by
the millionaire at 22 O'Farrell street and
the verbal contract of marriage which
was subsequently made by her and
Blythe.
The court adjourned at this point until
to-day at 10 a. m., when the cross-exam
ination will be continued.

Ives Arraigned in Court.
Harold Ives, the New "York advertising
man who was arrested Monday for pass-
Ing bogus checks on the Bank of Califor
nia, appeared before Judge .Conlan yes
terday. He was instructed and arraigned
and by consent the case was continued
for one week. Ive-s* bonds were fixed in
$4000, but his friends will make an effort
to have them reduced so that he can be
released. He still declares that he will be
able to straighten things out with the
bank.
Says Gunther Kept the Money.
Norman Hill and Charles Gunther are
employed in the Rlsdon Iron Works. Jan
uary 7 Hill alleges he gave Gunther $50,
to be .sent by telegraphic order to New
York, but Gunther kept the money. Yes
terday Hill swore to a warrant in Judge
Cabaniss' court for Gunther's arrest on
a charge of misdemeanor embezzlement.

NEW YORK, Jan. 21.â To-day's stock mar
ket had the same appearance of indigestion
and somnolence which has pervaded it of late.
The movement of prices was exceedingly ' slug-'
glsh and narrow and the volume of dealings
tell funher away. The net changes are email
and mixed. To understand the character of
the market comparison with previous, condi
tions will be helpful. This time last year was
a period of constantly developing projects for
combinations and centralization of control on
a scale never before witnessed. Th*re
was a progressive advance from month
tc month in the volume of the trade balance
in favor of this country. The operation of
the currency and refunding laws was rapidly
e xpandirg the country's circulation and i pro
viding the requisite financial facilities for the
vast loan expansion in connection with ; the
great projects in hand. At present the stock
market misses these stimulating influences.
While there Is nothing positively unfavorable
in the outlook there is a surfeited feeling from
the undigested mass of last year's great pro
jects. The country's foreign trade balance,
although still in our favor, shows progressive
decline from month to month, compared with
the corresponding months of last year. " The
i.atinnal banks, instead of putting out addi
tional note issues, are retiring their circula
tion up to the monthly limit allowed by the
law, and applications are already on file for
withdrawal of circulation sufficient to ex
haust the legal limit into March. Talk of
new combinations is heard, but only with
skepticism and distrust. There is a latent fear
that such combinations may be for hostile
purposes rather than for mutual benefit. Ru
mors have circulated for a few days that all
the great banks and trust companies in New
York, and even the insurance companies, are
crystallizing into two groups along the lines
of cleavage that developed in the financial bat
tle of last May. It is such general considera
tions as these that must be looked to to gain
light on the present stock market. There was
a show of strength In Sugar and Metropolitan,
but the gains were subsequently wiped out.
Glucose continued its recent advance to the
amount of a point, but afterward fell % be
low last night. There was an active demand
for Mexican Central at an advance of 1%,
accompanied by reports of a new bond â¢ issue
and the acquisition of additional lines. Na
tional Salt, after a long period of inactivity,
was offered down over 11 points below the last
sale and then rallied 5. The preferred lost 4
No explanation was offered beyond the ob
struction to the plan of reorganization.
American Tobacco was stricken from the ex
change list, owing to the Insignificant amount
of the stock outstanding and the facility thus
offered for manipulation and the possible
working of .a corner. The market showed
come recovery and closed Irregular. 'Â¦
Consolidated Tobacco 4s continued to make
up the largest part of the bond market and
were reactionary. Total Eales, par value. $3,

FOR TUESDAY. JANUARY ZL
Receipts of Produce.
"LOS ANGELES SUMMARY.â Cool, dry
Â¦weather, with ocasional frost, without dam
age, was followed Saturday night and Sun
day morning by rain too light to be of much
benefit In valleys, but quite heavy in mount
ains."
"EUREKA SUMMARY. â Comparatively
little rain has fallen since January 1. Grain
and pasturage are doing well. Plowing, seed
ing and pruning are progressing. But little
snow In the mountains.
"SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.â The weather
has been partly cloudy and foggy along the
coast, and generally warm and clear In the
interior. Heavy frosts have occurred in some
sections. The rainfall on Sunday -will be of
great benefit to all crops, and in some places
will enable farmers to resume plowing and
seeding; if followed by . more rain soon there
Â¦will be a fair crop of grain. Irrigation water
Is still plentiful in most places, and is being
freely used. Sugar beet planting has com
menced at Santa Maria. Pasturage has be
come very scarce, but will be revived -by the
rain. Orange ' shipments continue. Late
frosts have severely damaged oranges in some
sections..
"COAST AND BAY SECTIONS. â Rain at
the close cf the week extended through all
sections, greatly benefiting grain and feed,
particularly In the southern coast counties,
where farmers will now resume plowing and
eeeding. In the central and northern districts
grain is in very good condition, though mak
ing clow growth. In the southern counties
some injury has resulted from the long con
tinued dry -weather, especially in the districts
Â¦where fogs have not prevailed; prospects for
crops have undoubtedly been much improved
by the rain, and green feed -will become more
plentiful. Orchards and vineyards continue
in good condition, and prospects are excel
lent for a heavy yield of fruit.
"SAN JOAQCIN VALLEY. â The weather
has continued cold, cloudy and fog^y during
the -week, with frequent frosts. Light showers
fell In portions of the valley Saturday night
and Sunday, benefiting grain and pasturage
to some extent. Grain is in fair condition ex
cept in the southern districts, but is making
slow growth owing to cold weather. Green
feed is plentiful in most sections, and stock
are In good condition. Plowing and seeding
continue. There is some prospect that the
grain acreage will be less than last season's
and the yield unsatisfactory. Orchards and
vineyards are in excellent condition and
fruit proepwrts are good.
"The continued cool -weather has been very
beneficial to deciduous fruit trees, and it is
thought they are now comparatively safe
from late spring frosts. Orchards and vine
yards are In excellent condition In all sec
tions. Irrigation water is being freely used
In the southern districts. Oranges have been
considerably Injured by late frosts in South
ern California.
"SACRAMENTO VALLEY. â Favorable
weather conditions have prevailed during the
week, with light rain at the close, and crop
prospects are very good. Grain has made
slow but healthy growth, and. is in excellent
condition. Rain was beneficial to grain, pas
turage and orchards, though not really needed
at present, as the soil had sufficient moisture.
There Trtll be a full crop of -wheat and barley
12 conditions continue favorable. Green feed
Is plentiful, and stock doing well. Work in
orchards and vineyards is progressing. Fruit
prospects are excellent. Almond buds are
swelling.
"Conditions have been somewhat more
favorable for crops than during the preced
ing week, though rather cool for the growth
of grain and feed. Fogs have prevailed along
the coast, severe frosts have occurred in por
tions of the interior, and rain has fallen in
nearly all sections, the heaviest precipitatin
having been in Southern California and .the
southern coast counties.
"Grain has made slow but healthy growth in
all sections north of the Tehachapi, and is in
very good condition, especially in the Sacra
mento Valley, where prospects for a heavy
crop are most excellent. In the southern dis
tricts grain has commenced to show the ef
fect of the drought, but prospects are now
considerably better and fair crops are ex
pected in most places. The northern part of
the San Joaquln Valley is in much better con
dition than the central and southern portions,
and heavy crops are expected. Green feed
continues plentiful in all sections except the
couth. Sugar beet planting In the vicinity
of Santa Maria has commenced much earlier
than usual. Plowing and seeding are pro
gressing in 6oxne sections.

Gentlemen of the United Mine Workersâ The

thing on the programme to-day, but I have to
say with deep feeling and regret that charges
have been made by Miss Millie Meredith, an
ex-employe or the national office, affecting my
self aa president of the rational body, against
your national secretary, Mr. Wilson,- and also
against the national executive board. The time
has come for the election of national : officers,

ask the convention to hear these charges and
I ask William D. Van Horn of Indiana to take
the chair while the charges are being heard.

The purpose of the movement for reci
procity, he said, was to have the whole
expense of Cuba's relief fall on two Amer
ican industries â tobacco and sugar. There
was now a tobacco acreage in Ohio of 36.
000 acres; Wisconsin, 23,000; Pennsyl
vania, 22,000; New York,* <2,000: Connecti
cut, 11,000, and several thousand acres In
other States, which would be seriously
crippled.
As to cigars. Young declared that the
proposed concessions would "wipe out the
American-made 10-cent cigar." The Cu
ban cigarmakers would lay down a clear
here for less than the American manufac
turer receives for his high grade goods
and the Cuban would have the advantage
of having his goods advertised as "im
ported cigars." This, Young said, would
secure for Cuba the entire American mar
ket for all goods above 5 cents.
Representative Richardson of Tennessee
asked if the price of cigars would be re
duced to the cigar smoker. Young said
the price would be reduced, but he did not
believe the consumer would ask this re
duction at the expense of the American
Industry.
John R. Young, president of the Na
tional Leaf Tobacco Association, made an
earnest plea against any tobacca conces
sions to Cuba. He said there undoubtedly
was a public sentiment in favor of grant
ing relief to Cuba, but he contended that
we should be as just to the people of our
own country as to the people of foreign
countries.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21.â The Ways and
Means Committee to-day resumed Its
hearing on Cuban reciprocity with special
reference to the proposed reduction on
Cuban tobacco. The tobacco interests of

sented, the officers of the large leaf manu
facturers' and growers' associations being

plained here by the statement that the
Berlin authorities had before them when

inal and tentative programme, which waa
abandoned a day or two ago in. favor/of
an arrangement that involves two trips of
Prince Henry from New York to Wash
ington ; and the ; launching of the Meteor
on February. 25. The committee In charge
of arrangements tried hard to draw up an
itinerary - that would relieve the Prince
of the I necessity of making two trips be
tween New -York and Washington, but it
has so far been unable to plan any other
arrangement that would not involve an
abandonment of social functions in either
this city or. New York. . The latest pro
gramme . was cabled 'to â¢ Berlin yesterday
afternoon, . and the committee is waiting
the approval Â¦ of the Emperor and V- prince
Henry; If Berlin decides that the orig
inal programme would be adhered to
the committee here will amend the pro
gramme to correspond." ,
BERLIN, Jan. 21.â A news agency here
has received a dispatch from Chicago- rep
resenting the Chief of Police of that city
as saying that he could not be responsible
for the safety of Prince Henry off Prus

of the detective force sufficient to stop
any anarchist movements. This cable
gram is regarded by some officials as an
invention intended to frighten Prlnco
Henry into abandoning his trip or to in
ject a sinister, element Into his visit.
During Prince Henry's call yesterday
on Andrew D. White. United States Em
bassador here, the visitor spent most^ of

Philippines he learned absolutely that the
Americans promised independence to the
Filipinos.
Kahn of California challenged him to
produce the name of a single Filipino who
gave him such information.
Gaines said that the information had
been given him in confidence and that if
he were to divulge the names of those
who had given it to him they would lose
their heads. This reply elicited jeers from
the Republican side.
Dinsmore of Arkansas also spoke in op

Ex-Secretary Foster will be heard next
Thursday on the international phases of
the proposed Chinese exclusion. Chair
man Penrpse announced after to-day's
hearing that the whole subject would be
gone into very carefully by the commit
tee. -. -:Â¦:-:' Â¦'
Speaking for the Porto Rico Mall
Steamship Company. Maxwell Evarts de
clared that the Mitchell bill would put a
tax on American commerce that no sub
sidy bill could replace. It would prohibit
the employment of Chinese seamen
aboard x American ships, and this would
result in an enormous difference in' the
matter of wages. He said that our Com
missioners to negotiate a new Chinese
treaty in two years should not be ham
pered and embarrassed by the passage
of any new law.
.. Hamlin presented resolutions of the
Boston Chamber of Commerce, advocat
ing the Proctor bill continuing in force
the present Chinese exclusion law until
the expiration of the existing treaty
with China in 1904, and urged that no bill
be adopted inconsistent with that treaty,
because, he said, "that treaty involves
the honor and faith of the United States
Government."
He said that the Chinese student, Chi
nese traveler and Chinese merchant have
been unfairly dealt with. Upon being
questioned, he admitted that there is 9.
division of sentiment among the delega
tion as represented by him, some of them
being perfectly satisfied with the law as
it now stands, while others are dissatis
fied with the Interpretation of the law.
He said that the hope of imbibing Ameri
can ideas lay in the Chinese student and
the law Is hurtful particularly to ; this
class of Chinese. . ./
"We are all interested in being on good
terms with China," he said,- "and should
treat her with some degree of considera
tion."
->Â¦Â¦ Foord spoke in opposition to the bill
and presented statistics of trade between
China and the United States. He urged
a.' postponement of any action by Con
gress looking to Chinese exclusion until
the expiration of the present treaty in
1904.
Gompers, the first speaker, outlined the
efforts which the Federation of Labor
had made in connection with the Pacific
Coast . delegation In Congress to perfect
a bill which would secure a continuance
of Chinese exclusion, and this had been
accomplished in what is known as the
Mitchell bill.

At the conclusion of Rawlins' speech
Bacon of Georgia referred, to a colloquy
between himself and Lodge concerning an
order of the Secretary of War to permit
ships under foreign flags to enter the
trade between the United States and the
Philippines after the decision of the Su
preme Court that the islands -were do
mestic territory. No exigency of trade,
in his opinion, was sufficient reason for
such violation of the law. Bacon said
that if he had been Secretary of War he
would not have issued such an order, be
cause he could conceive of no emergency
which would warrant him in violating the
law. He protested against what he con
sidered "hot haste" in pressing the pend
ing .measure and against what he assert
ed was an effort to withhold from the
Senate information relating to the Phil
ippines.
Stewart of Nevada took issue with Ba
con's argument that an executive officer
could not set aside a law for the public
good, as being in contravention of the
history and jurisprudence of England and
America. He asserted that the rule had
existed for centuries that statutory law
must yield to great emergencies.
At 4:S5 o'clock the Senate went into ex
ecutive session and at 5:50 adjourned.
The debate was opened by Lodge of
Massachusetts, chairman of the Commit
tee on Philippines. He sketched the rea
sons which -had actuated the majority in
presenting the measure and urged strong
ly its enactment into law at an early
date. He explained the necessity for the
legislation embodied in the bill, and con
cluded with an appeal to Congress to
deal with questions relating to the Phil
ippines as they might arise and to keep
clear of vague words and vaguer prom
ises, which were likely to be misinter
preted and to raise false hopes in the
minds of the Filipinos. In an impassioned
peroration he besought Congress not to
give mortgages on an unknown future.
Rawlins of Utah delivered a vigorous
speech in support of the minority substi
tute, in which independence was promised
to the Filipinos as soon as a stable gov
ernment could be established in the Phil
ippines. His discussion of the general
Philippine question covered much of the
ground that has been gone over during
the past two years. Throughout he was
accorded careful attention.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 21.â For nearly
three hours 'to-day the Senate, had under
consideration the Philippine tariff bill.
The measure was made the unfinished
business and probably will hold that po
sition of preference until it shall have
been voted on finally.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21. -The State De
partment will not be drawn into the con
troversy which has sprung up between
the European powers respecting the ef
forts made by them to prevent the United
States from going to war with Spain.
Lord Cranborne's statement in Parlia
ment yesterday is recognized as absolute
ly correct as far as it went, but there are
chapters in the story which he did not
touch upon and it is recognized here as
inexpedient to develop all the facts, even
now, lest animosities spring up without
sufficient reason. The frank statement of
Lord Cranborne touching Austria's earn
est efforts to prevent war caused no re
sentment here, where it is realized that
there were dynastic and sympathetic rea
sons that justified or at least extenuated
the Austrian purpose. Â»
VIENNA. Jan. 21.â Inquiries at the Aus
trian-Hungarian Foreign Office confirm
the essential points of the statement
made by Lcrd Cranborne, the British
Foreign Under Secretary, in the House of
Commons yesterdav. The dynastic rela
tions of Austria with Spain, the Queen
Hegent being an Archduchvss of Austria,
led Austria, before the declaration of the
war between Spain and the United States,
to begin a peace propaganda which was
carried on not only in England, but
throughout Europe. France was ready
to second the efforts of Austria. Germany
and Russia maintained a passive attitude.
Great Britain was at first disposed to
sign the proposed note, but after a con
lidentlal report from Washington declined
either to sign such a noie as the Austrian
Embassador proposed or to take any fur
ther steps. Afterward Austria and
France made direct representations at
Washington, but ceased their efforts after
the declaration of war, from that time
forth relying on the efforts of the Pope,
who was backed by the tacit approval of
all the jvowers.
The Facts From Vienna.
A telegraphic report of Lord Cran
borne's statement, in reply to the inter
pellation of Henry Xorman, M. P., was
distributed to the German newspapers by
the news agencies early in the day, yet
none of the Berlin evening papers, with
the exception of the Xorth German Ga
zette, prints it- The North German Ga
zette does not comment upon Lord Cran
borne's statement. The suppression of
what at another lime would be regarded
as news is taken to mean that tne Ger
man press is determined not to revive
unpleasant discussions at an inopportune
moment.
Some annoyance has been expressed in
official circles here that the British Under
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Lord Cran
borne, and the British Foreign Office at
this moment should make statements
tending to discourage the growing good
feeling between Germany -and the United
States, and seemingly designed to spoil
the pleasant prospect of the visit to the
I'nited States of Admiral Prince Henry of
Prussia. The interpellation in the Brit
ish House of Commons yesterday to
which Lord Cranborne replied is here
considered to have been got up especially
to give the opportunity of saying some
thing in Parliament which might be taken
as a basis for reviving stories adverse to
Germany in the matter of German rela
tions with the United States.
Anger at the British.
"The Foreign Office declares with all
positiveness uhat Germany, neither be
fore the outbreak of the Spanish-Ameri
can War nor during its course, proposed
intervention to ether powers. Neither did
Germany support such a proposition made
by other powers. It is true that in sev
eral instances suggestions (anregungen)
were made to the German Government
from other sources, in the sense of inter
vention. But the German Government,
without exception, maintained a negative
attitude toward such suggestions, and
made known its negative standpoint
whenever occasion offered. It must fur
ther be remarked that it was not from
an Austrian tnicht Gerade von Oester
reichischer seite) that such suggestions
reached the German Government."
BERLIN, Jan. 2Lâ The Foreign Office
denies that Germany desired, or asso
ciated itself with any other Government
that may have sought to bring about
European intervention in the Spanish-
American War. A correspondent this aft
ernoon communicated to the German For
eign Office the statement emanating yes
terday from the British Foreign Office to
the effect that Germany, France and Rus-
Eia had supported tha Austrian Embassa
dor at London in his attempt to induce
Great Britain to sign a collective note ad
dressed to the United States, proposing
action by the European states, in view of
the outbreak, or expected outbreak, of
the late war between the United States
and Spain. Later in the day the follow
ing statement was handed to the corre
spondent:
Legislators Discuss Relations
With the Oriental
BERKELEY, Jan. 21.â The Intercolle
giate debating committee met to-day and'
set Friday evening, February 14, as the
time for the annual forensic contest for
the Carnot medal between the University
of California and Stanford University.
The sides will be drawn to-morrow, thus
giving the debaters three weeks in which
to prepare for a particular side of the
Question, instead of twenty-four hours, as
the custom has been heretofore. The
change will be tried this time as an ex
periment.
California will be represented in the
coming struggle of argument by F. M.
Allen, 1* E. Martin and H. I* Rothchlld.
with Walter Rothchild as alternate. The
three speakers have been chosen after a
series of preliminary debates of excep
tional merit. Nine men spoke in Utd
finals and their ability was so evenly Â¦
matched that the judges had great dim
culty in making the decision.
Of the three speakers chosen one has
already been a member of a Carnot team.
Martin held that honor last year. The
young man Is a senior In the college of
social sciences. He entered the univer
sity from the Berkeley High School in
1898, where he held positions on school de
bating teams, competing with the Oak
land High School on one occasion. He
was president of the 1902 Debating Soci
ety in his sophomore year and of tho
Students' Congress last term. Last year
he . was substitute on the intercollegiate
team. -
F. M. Allen graduated from Pomona
High School in' 1897, and while there took
up debating. At college he has won five
prizes in literary contests. He has been
editor of the Californian and associate
editor of the Occident, both student pub
lications, and last term was president of
the Senate, a debating organization. Al
len is a member of the "Winged Helmet
and the Phi Sigma Delta fraternity.
H. L. Rothchild graduated from tho
Lowell High School in San Francisco in
1S98. He entered the university In tho
college of social sciences and has done
considerable debating as a member of
tne Students* Congress.
Walter Rothchild, the alternate. Is also
a Lowell graduate. He is a student !n
Hastings College of Law and has repre
sented that college in two victorious de
bating contests against the Students*
Congress. Â¦ :.".'.;,Â¦Â«.

The following letter Irom the Montezuma

'"San i-'rancisco. Calif.
"Gentlemen:
"We beg to announce that on April 1st,
1902. the shares or the Montezuma Mining
Company will be advanced to 50 cents, pay-
ment in all cases cash. No installment con-
tracts will be authorized or accepted by the
Company upon any terms after the date
aforementioned. Meanwhile, a regular
monthly rise in values, to be duly an-.'
nounced. will be made until April 1st. Our
agents are asked to note these fact3 and
govern themselves accordingly.
"It has all along been confidently asserted
by the management that the shares of tha
Montezuma Mining Company -have been,
quoted far below their actual values. The;
Increased prices, named above, are the best
guarantee that we can give of our faith in thÂ«
above, dictum often repeated to ourrfgenta.
The Company is now quite beyond the devel-
opment stage. It has the means requisite to
place its mining operations upon a paying
basis, aa we believe. Of course, this state-
ment does not Include the larger plans of tha
Company, embracing the erection of coal
bunkers at Seattle. Tacoma and San Fran-
cisco, and coke ovens at the latter point;
Improvements that must. If they are made,
come through additional sales of stock It
is enough, for the present to say that by
April 1st the improvements the company
now have in hand will be complete and upoa
an eminently profitable basis.
".It our hopes are realized, as we havÂ»
every confidence they . will be, our shares
after . April 1st will be sought after at a
price much beyond the figure we have
named. This Is the argument and reason
for the sharp advance in price, named above.
'Our agents are asked to be guided strictly
by the facts. Monthly price notices will be
Issued as usual, and the monthly letter of
the president will give yourselves and clients
full Information as to the progress made la
the several enterprises in which the Com-
pany is interested.
"Yours faithfully.

RELIABLE NEWS FROM THE MINES.
The Washlneton "Journal of Mining"
publishes interesting news of our mines and
others of the district, as follows:
"In the year 1901 all records have been
broken in regard to the amount of devel-
opment work done In mines. Especially i3
this true of the development of copper, gold.
silver and coal properties, which has taken
place In. the Carbon River Mining District
and the Tahoma Mininsr District. In th~
Carbcn River Minin? District a location has
been made for a railroad running from Mon-
tezuma to the Surprise mines, the Chicago
group, belongins to the Montezuma Mining
Company, the Leola mines and the Copper
King mines, that will benefit a score of
other properties on which work is be!n*
done. The right of way of this road through
the forest reserve has been granted by tha
Government to the Washington Co-opera-
tive Mining Syndicate. The tunnel of tho
Leolxk* lllnlnc Company. ' 725 feet long, has
" been leased to the Washington Co-operative
Mining Syndicate, who have Installed com-
pressed air machinery, and have let a eon-
tract for 400 feet of entry which Is to. con-
nect thia tunnel "with their Surprise group of
veins at a perpendicular depth of 300 feat
below their present 'working. This tunnel i9
being pushed by night and day shifts and
will soon cross the mother lode, which in
turn will tap the Surprise and Gulley veins,
thus putting in sight an immense quantity
of ore.

uated north of the Surprise group. This com-
pany, during the present season, extended
the trails to the location at which they are
developing the ore, and have erected houses,
stables and other necessary quarters, and
will undoubtedly make a great showing dur-
ing the coming year.
â¢â¢In the Tahoma. District a great deal of
money has been expended by the Montezuma
Mining Company and the Washington Co-
operative Mining Syndicate in perfecting a
first-class trail to their mines situated on
the Mowlch River, fifteen miles from Monte-
zuma. The Montezuma Mining Company
has installed on the Tahoma. group of mines
a compressed air plant, which was attended
with a great deal of difficulty, as the lum-
ber all had to be whipsawed from Alaska
cedar at a high altitude, and the machinery
had to be packed in, and some portions
which -were heavy snaked In over the trail.
but the plant is now running and develop-
ment work will be very rapid. This com-
pany has already driven 250 feet of entry on
the large veins of chalcopyrite ore. and they
are now runninsr another on the same rein
150 feet below the first entry. As their ore
In the upper entry ran from six to seven-
teen feet -wide, with values ranging from
?25 to $125 per ton, this lower entry will
put in sight by spring a vast quantity of
ore which beyond question will warrant the
building of an electric railroad for its
transportation. .
â¢The Montezuma Mining Company are
opening a. largo cpal mine at Montezuma.
and are shipping coal. The coal measures
they are developing are geologically the old-
est that have been developed in the State,
an* a test of this coal made by the quar-
termaster general of the United States Army
shows that It is the best coal mined either
In "Washlneton or British Columbia. This
company is installing a plant of one hundred
coke ovens. The Northwest Improvement
Company are opening large mines three miles
down the Carbon River from Montezuma and
are already shipping coal; they. too. ara
erecting a large number of coke ovens. At
Fairfax, the "Western American Company-
have increased their Dlant of coke ovens
during the year to sixty-five. The Carbon
Coal Comoany of. Carbonado have erected
seventy-five coke ovens. The Wilkinson Coal
Company of Wilkeson have erected fifty ad-
ditional ovens, which will give them 100.
"As a. summary, the mining interests of
Pierce County have been fully doubled dur-
ing the present year."

October seems to -have been the most pros
perous month, as the export business for that
month amounted to nearly $6,000,000.
Two hundred and one grain cargooes were
cleared during the year. Real estate to the
value of over $29,000,000 has changed- hands

For many years Great Britain has been our
best customer for wheat and still continues,
as she has taken 7,000,000 centals during the
year. Our products still continue to increase
in value. The gold production for the year was
over $13,0CO.0CÂ»>â silver over $1,000,000. Our
wheat crop amounted to over 30,000.000 bush
sis, valued at something over $18,000,000. Our
barley crops exceeded' 20,000.000 bushels and
were valued at over $7,500,000. The salmon
pack of the Pacific Coast was the largest on
record, being 5.043,000 cases. Dairy products

State. Our bean crop has also been very suc
Â«ssrul, amounting to 54.000.000 pounds. The
rTtsln crop amounted to 72,000,000 pounds. The

equally . satisfactory.
Great Showing Made in October.
The Chamber of Commerce held it3 an
nual meeting- yesterday and the reports
of the president, George A. Newhall, an<l
Secretary E. Scott were read and adopted.
Referring to a direct steamship line with
the Philippine Islands and the stand taken
by the Secretary of War in advising the
sale of transports and encouraging^ the
establishment of a private steamship line
between the United States and the Philip
pines', President Newhall states in his re
port that It would be better for the com
mercial interests to maintain transports
under- Government management until the
withdrawal of the troops from the islands
than to supplement the transport service
with private lines that should have a cer
tain percentage of freight guaranteed to
them by the Government.
The report shows the following work
done during the year: The naming of a
first class cruiser the California; the ac
complishment of the China basin leaso;
the appropriation of $90,000 for a relief
lightship; the successful- protest against
the movement of the United States trans
port service from the port of San Fran
cisco; the reduction of tariff on flour from
75 cents to 4Q cents per hundred kilos and
material reduction made in canned goods;
the promisa, of the Government to estab
lish wireless telegraphy between the-Far
allon Islands and the mainland; indorse
ment of the metric system of weights
and measures; -petition to the Secretary
of War to establish at least one of the
military instruction camps In California,
and consideration and propositions on
many other matters connected with the
welfare of the city and State. The fol
lowing statistics show that the business
of the city and State has been Improved
"by leaps and bounds." The report says:
Prosperity Reigns Throughout State.
Our savings banks are overcrowded with
money and loans â¢ have been made as low
as 5% per cent grossâ the lowest rate ever
known in this city. Our city has seventeen
commercial bank3 with resources of over
$87,000^)00 and deposits aggregating over
S50,0OO,lHX). We have also nine savings bants
with resources of over $139,000,000 and deposits
aggregating $128,000,000. Our banka gained
$20,000,000 in resources during the year. The
bank clearances for 1901 were over $1,000,000,
000âan increase over l'JOO of about f 14i>,000,000.
The month of October was the banner month,
showing clearances of over $118,000,000. The
clearance for December 31. l'JOl. was $7,000,000
âthe greatest for any one day , on record.
These figures do not include the five national
banks in San Francisco. Â«_ '
The State has forty-two national banks with,
resources of over $75,000,000. Five of these
banks are in San Francisco and represent
nearly half of this total. The city savings
banks have I increased their deposits some
f'J.OCO.OGO during the year.* The total amount
of dividends paid out by corporations listed
on the San Francisco Stock and Bonk Ex
change was $11.U75,359. The United States
customs collections - for the year were over
$t500,000 per month. The total exports ot mer
chandise by sea were over $40,000,000 and the
total Imports of merchandise by sea for the
year were over $3Â«, 000,000, showing an excess
of our exports over our imports of $4,000,tAJO.
Our Hawaiian trade amounts to over $1,000,000
per month, and if it was included in the ota
tlstlcs of the port,- as in former years, it
would make a larger showing for exports of
the port than any in the history of the city.

SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 21.â C. E. Atwood
to-day pleaded guilty to obtaining money
under false pretenses from Manager R.
V. Halton of Hotel Rafael and was sen
tenced'by Juctice of the Peace Rodden
to serve six months in the County Jail.
Last fall Atwood cut quite a dash In the
hotel, where he essayed the part of a
wealthy guest. In an evil moment Man
ager Halton cashed a $50 check and then
Atwood disappeared. -After some time he
was located In Los Angeles, where he was
serving a sentence for a similar offense.
Atwood got off easily to-day because
the otticlals did not wish to put the
county to the expense of bringing wit
nesses from the East to convict him of
a felony. He drew his check on an East
ern batik, and' this saved him. Since his
arrest it has been ascertained that he is
wanted in a number of counties, where
he induced citizens to part with their
cash for his checks.

which they; sold three years ago to move
to .Fruitvale. â¢-.Â¦Â¦-.- .- . Â¦ Â¦ '
Regarding his wife, Bair said that he
had often begged her not, to pass the
money, but that she persisted in doing so.
When arrested: Mrs. Bair's s'ster, M S3
Nellie Shicketanz, Â»was with her. The lat
ter is a resident of Council Bluffs and
has been on the coast but one week. The
detectives' are v confident that she knows
nothing'of . the counterfeiting and did not
detain her. , Miss Shicketanz, however,
persisted in remaining in the City Prison
with her sister^all night. ,
The woman passed the dollars In leading
dry. goods, houses, and they having the
same ring as a perfect coin, the clerks
did not hesitate to accept them. She also
spent much with Italian ''flower- venders
and received change on small'- purchases.
â¢ Hazen- and MomttC followed Bair into
the betting i ring yesterday afternoon, and
when he placed his bet they arrested and
searched him. In addition to the spurious
coins he had depositedon the race, others
were found 'in his possession.' Mrs. Bair
was taken Into, custody .by Hammill. and
Foster while in a furniture store in \ this
city, but when searched had none ; of the
counterfeits about her. . ,.
Hazen and vMoffltt placed Â¦ Bair in a
buggy and hastily.' ' drove to Fruitv4Lle.
where they made a complete - search of

covered piece after piece of the counter
feiter's plant Bair broke down and con
fessed. Some., of the apparatus j was
stored in a garret, more was hidden un
der a back porch and part . of it was
found in a woodshed. Bair stated that
he had Just completed the manufacture
of $100, of which $70 was found in his
house. He says he has been in the habit
of spending at 'least $15,, a day at the

SAX JOSE, Jan. 21.-Chief of Police
James A. Kidward to-day ' tendered his
resignation to the Police Commission, to
take effect on July 1. This comes as a
surprise to the people, for Just a week
ago the Chief forced the resignation ' of
Captain of Police P. H. Newberry. There
was friction between Newberry and Kid
ward and the latter notified the commis
sion that either Xewberry or he would
have to go.
In his resignation Chief Kidward says
that he regrets that he must sever his
connection with the Police Department,
but his private interests will require most
of his time. He is interested in a. large
livery stable in this city. Politicians,
however, declare the real reason for his
withdrawal is that he has his eye on the
Republican nomination fon Sheriff .this
fall. â¢ 7 â¢
Chief Kidward has been a peace officer
of this city and county for fifteen years.
He served as a deputy sheriff and con

Three weeks ago the detectives first
suspected Bair. They observed him plac
ing bets of |2 on each race and learned
that one of the dollars was invariably a
counterfeit. Bair slipped the coins to the
pool sellers with the bad one underneath
when there was a large crowd clamor
ing for tickets. By these methods he
nearly escaped detection. , The- officers
then learned who the suspect was, his
place of residence and. the names of his
associates. They were surprised on dis
covering that Bair was counted among
the leading citizens of Fruitvale and that
he enjoyed the confidence of many;excel
lent people.- - . ,, :-'.'Â¦Â¦Â¦.;.â¢
Mrs. Bair was shadowed in this city by
Detective Hammill and be Â¦ gathered up
much bad money, after each of her visits.
About four months ago patrons of the
racetrack and the bookmakers themselves
complained of counterfeit dollars th*.t
came into the betting ring. ' Since that
time Hazen, Mom tt, Foster and Ham
mill have watched to catch the person who
placed the. coin in circulation, and until
three weeks ago they were. unable to get
a clew. While the detectives spent \ days
at the track and watched every one who
played money on the ponies they found
themselves' constantly outwitted and bad
dollars among each day's receipts. .
The detectives have been patiently
watching a trap they set to catch the
counterfeiters, but the capture was only
made yesterday. Bair was taken at the
Oakland racetrack and lodged in the'Ala
meda County Jail. To his captors, Hazen
and Moffitt, he made a complete confes
sion. Mrs. Bair was arrested in this city
by Foster and Hammill and â¢ put under,
lock and key at the Central police sta
tion. She had distributed much of the
bad coin among the leading â¢ dry 'â¢ goods
stores and among flower venders on the
streets. Bair operated exclusively at the
racetrack,- while his wife "worked",- this
side of the bay. IriÂ» his confession Bair
says that he manufactured and rid him
self of thousands of, spurious' dollars,
winning many thousands more in the bet
ting ring. The counterfeiter was former
ly a restaurant-keeper in this city, * but
three years ago he abandoned legitimate
business and started to. perfect himself
in the coining of bogus "metal. He suc
ceeded to such an extent that Secret Ser
vice Asent Hazen Â¦ pronounces - the pro
ducts of his molds the most perfect â¢imi
tation of genuine coin that he has ever
handled since he has been in the employ
of the Government.

I want no more of it."
Hanson was chopping wood when - he
heard a commotion at his house, and,
going to investigate, found Davis eating
an apple. Hanson approached from be
hind, thrust the muzzle of his gun into
Davis' face and told him to hold up his
hands and march to the penitentiary.
"That's good enough for me," said Da
vis, and they started for the penitentiary.
Instead of making Davis go ahead,
Hanson marched him along on the left
side of him. After they had gone a half
mile Hanson shifted his gun to his left
hand. Davis, watching his opportunitj',
seized the stock and struck Hanson upSn
the head, knocking him to his- knees. A
etruggle ensued, but two special guards
opportunely came in sight and assisted
Hanson in overpowering Davis, who was
marched to the penitentiary without fur
ther trouble.
Davis, the convict supposed to have
been wounded last night, was caught this
afternoon by Rancher Hanson. While on
the way to the prison he knocked Hanson
down and tried to take his gun. but was
seized *>y two other guards who happened
to come up at the time and the three
overpowered him after a hard struggle.
Davis had not been wounded.-
