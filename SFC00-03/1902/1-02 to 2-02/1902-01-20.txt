The calendar of the House of Repre
sentatives is still rather meager in im
portant bills, so that there does not prom
ise to be a heavy pressure of business dur
ing the week: Monday is the regular sus
pension day, but there are few measures
likely to be passed by suspension of the
rules. The urgent deficiency appropria
tion bill will occupy most of the time
during the. first few days of the week. It
carries a total of $160,000,000, which is
rather large for a .deficiency measure, and
it is expected that two days will be occu
pied -in its consideration. .Beyond this
there is practically no programme for the
week, as the bills ready for consideration
are not of sufficient importance to secure
definite time In advance, except in the
case of the Hill bill for the exchangeabil
ity of silver and gold. It will be some
time before opinion is sufficiently matured
on. this measure to induce the leaders to
set a time for its consideration.
The speech is expected to have a bear
ing upon the reciprocity treaties. Its de
livery at this time will be reoulred by a
number of Senators. If there should be
an -executive session of the Senate on
Monday there will be an effort made to
have .the nomination of Governor Otero
of New. Mexico confirmed.
During the early part of the week, prob
ably to-morrow. Senator Cullom will ad
dress the Senate on the treaty making
power of the President.
Senator Frye will probably report the
ship subsidy bill to-morrow, -but he will
not attempt to secure consideration for
it for the present and probably not until
after the Philippine bills shall have been
disposed of* â¢
The report of the Committee on Inter
oceanic Canals Is expected later in the
week,. but may be delayed. The consider
ation of that question in the Senate will
wait on the Philippine bill. During the
week Senator Nelson will make renewed
effort to secure the passage of his bill
for. the creation of a department of com
merce. The opposition to It will probably
be continued for the present.
A long discussion of the bill is expected
by the Republicans and promised by the
Democrats. The Democratic' leaders say
they do not expect to be able to defeat
the bill and disclaim all Intention to de
la ji a vote unnecessarily, but they say
frabkly that they consider that it affords
an opportunity for the presentation, of
their views; of -. the Philippine question
which they, cannot afford to let pass.
Senator Lodge will open the discussion
with a brief speech on Tuesday, in which
he will discuss the merits of , the bill and
â¢also the v necessity ' for early action. He
will â¢ be . followed by some member. of the
Democratic representation on the .com
mittee, who will outline the Democratic
position. He in turn will be followed by
other Democratic Senators. Nearly all of

expected to be heard before final actlop.
shall be secured. Indeed, the prediction
is freely made that a vote will not be ob
tained within a month. .Senator Lodge's
plan is to hold the measure to the front
to the exclusion of all other business when
the bill is once, made the unfinished busi
'ness. - . 'â¢ â .
I There Is a general acquiescence of Re
publican Senators in this programme.
There arc other important measures to be
presented at the proper time by admin*
istration Senators, but the present agree
ment Is to pass the Philippine bill first,
as being of the most immediate impor
tance. \
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.â The Philippine
question will be precipitated on the Sen
ate to-morrow when the committee on the
Philippine question which has had the
House Philippine tariff bill under con
sideration expects to report 'the measure.
The bill, with committee amendments,
will be sent to the printer, and Senator
Lodge, chairman of the committee, will
give notice of his intention to call it up
on the following day and ask for its con
tinued consideration until finally disposed
of. . . '
When there is a run on the treasury for
gold it is the salvation of commerce and thÂ«
reserve to have In circulation a currency which
Imposes no further demand on that metal. The
bill will plunge the Government deeper into
the banking business.
Thirdâ It will facilitate the exportation of
gold. Aa the $3S6,000,000 of our currency re
deemable in gold is scattered all over the
country it is difficult for largÂ«" exporters of
gold to collect sufficient of that currency to
present for redemption. But if stiver .certifi
cates, which form the great bulk of the cur
rency that circulates, can be better for pay
ment in gold, then it becomes an easy matter
to compel the Government to furnish all the
gold for exportation.
With other nations Imposing restrictions
upon their exportation of gold, and we fa
cilitating our exportation of the same, we
are likely to lose great quantities of that Ufa
blood of commerce.
Fourth â It will cause the retirement of the
silver dollars and produce either a violent con
traction of the currency or the substitution of
printed promises to pay. It will convert assets
Into liabilities, dollars into debts.
Fifth â Other things remaining as they are.
such a measure would cause a fall in price of
all commodities and other property â falling
prices produce bankruptcy and panics. -
No nation on the face of the globe requires
Us exchequer to exchange gold for silver.
This is a new policy in the treatment of the
precious metals. Why should this, the great
t-st silver-producing nation in the world be
the first to strike a blow at one of Its great
est industries?
All Representatives, regardless of politics,
should condemn such reckless legislation.
The Government now has the power to call
an absolute halt to a raid upon its gold re
serve by impounding: the greenbacks and treas
ury notes, but If silver Is made redeemable in
gold it cannot do so until it impounds also the
$530,000,000 of silver dollars and silver cirtifl
cates.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 19.â The Demo
cratic members of the House committee
on coinage, weights and measures have
agreed on a minority report on the bill
directing the. Secretary of the Treasury
"to exchange gold for legal tender silver
dollars," and the report will be presented
to the House to-morrw by Shafroth. The
report takes the position that the passage
of the- bill is certain to produce financial
disturbances. The following general prop
osition is laid down:
Our Government has never conceded the right
to the holder of stiver dollars to demand from
the treasury sold therefor, nor to the holder
of gold to demand silver dollars therefor.
Such demands always have been rufuaed at the
treasury. It la the notes and bonds of thÂ«
Government that are payable in either gold
or silver .at the option of the holder.
The following reasons why such a meas
ure should not be enacted are given:
First â It will require a large Increase of thÂ»
sold reserve of the treasury, as if the obliga
tions upon a reserve are Increased the reserve
should be correspondingly enlarged. If it re
quires $150,000,000 of gold to act aa a reserve
for the redemption of $346,000,000 of United
States notes, called greenbacks, and $40,283.
086 of treasury notes issued under the Sher
man act, will it not take at least $300,000,000
In gold to act as a reserve w&en thÂ© $330,732,
617 of silver dollars and silver certificates are
made a direct charge upon that reserve?
Second â It will create an endless chain upon
the sold reserve of the treasury and thereby
plunge the Government deeper into the banking
business. If the endless chain upon the treas
ury caused by the redemption and reissue of
greenbacks is a continual drain upon the gold
reserve and a' severe strain upon the Govern
ment how much more of a drain and strain will
the -$330. 000, 000 of new obligations upon that
reserve impose?

LETTED TO LOW
Dr. Parkhurst Comments
on Law Breaking in
New York.
NEW YORK, Jan. 19.â Rev. Dr. Charles
H. Parkhurst to-day gave out a letter ad
dressed to Mayor Low which had been
adopted by the executive committee of
the Society for* the Prevention of Crime,
of which Dr. Parkhurst is president. The
opening paragraph reads:
While the Society for the Prevention of
Crime counts itself distinctly an ally of the
present - municipal administration there are
certain principles of action to whlcn we have
uniformly adhered and which we deem it in
cumbent upon ourselves to pursue and to urge,
even at the risk of excepting the old policy
of those whom we would like in all respects to
second and support. -â¢ ;
In all our past activity as a society we have
proceeded upon the distinct understanding that
law exists for the purpose of being obeyed.
The letter goes on to say that the first
two weeks of the present regime have
made it ' "entirely indefinite as to what
civic righteousness in this city is and
what It Is not, and to that extent have
operated to put the reform administration
in the same criminal attitude toward law
as was that occupied by the administra
tions of '92, '93. '97 and '99."
It deplores the fact that "while char
tered by the State to labor for the pre
vention of crime," the society is not
"quite certain any longer what is crime,"
and says that "the atmosphere is clouded
by ambiguity emanating from administra
tive incertitude," and that "the situation
is morally intolerable." . â¢.
The letter further says that "there is
not very much- to choose between a Tam
many administration that has bad princi
ples and a reform administration that has
good principles but is afraid to use them."
The letter, which is signed by Dr. Park
hurst, concludes by demanding of Mayor
Low that "you brace your administration
in accord with your oath." and that he
summon the resources at his command to
the work of "frankly and resolutely sup
pressing open or clandestine violations of
recognized statutes."
This action, which Is entirely for the
prevention of crime, is construed as a
breach between the reformers and the re
form administration.
Mayor Low to-night refused to discuss
the letter. s

I am not a dancing man I stood on one side
to be out of the way and entered into con

captain, who spoke English perfectly. It was
soon evident to me that he was brilliant in
his profession and we engaged in rather sharp
professional talk. I did not agree with the
captain, whose name* I had not caught, and
I did not' hesitate to speak my mind, nor did
he. After a time he said he would be glad to
present me to his wife, and I found her a
very charming and . attractive woman. Of
course I had not caught her name either, but
after talking with her for a half hour I no

The entire city detective force has been
â¢working to locate the highwaymen, their
efforts meeting with success to-day when
two officers located Case, Kelly and
Myrtle in an Aiizo-street lodging-house.
They were surprised while asleep and
â¢were taken without difficulty. Various
articles stolen from recent victims were,
according to the- police, found in their
possession.
Color and Beckwith are declared to be
the men who recently held up four men
a.t Victor and San Bernardino and im
prisoned them in an empty box car, which
â¢was afterward picked up and hauled to
Los Angeles before the victims were lib
crated.
The men taken into custody axe Frank
Case, who has served a fifteen-year
term at San Quentin for highway rob
bery committed in San Francisco; "Wil

from San Francisco for burglary; Charles
Myrtle, alias Chris Merkle. alias W. C
Gordon, a two-termer; Frank Color,
Â¦whom the local police have connected

Beckwith, an escape from Whittier Re

robbery at Victor, near San Bernardino.
Case and Kelly escaped from the Aia

cording to the police officials, the trio
that has held up and robbed numerous.

In cash.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. IS.â The police of
Los Angeles to-day made a rich haul in
criminals that probably will put a stop
to the long series of burglaries and high
way robberies that have occurred almo&t
dally since the beg-innlng of the month.
' Solemn high vespers were celebrated in
the evening by the" Rev. Edward Allen,
S. J., assisted by the- Rev. Mr. Fleurens,
S. J., as deacon, and Rev. Mr. Buckley,
S. J., as subdeacon. Father Allen also of
ficiated at the solemn benediction, assisted
by Father de Rop, S. J., as deacon, and
Rev. Mr. Valla, S. J., as subdeacon.
The music was under the direction of
Rev. Father Cotelli. Riga's short mass
was sung by the male, choir. A motet
composed by Father Cotelli from a theme
by Rossini was rendered at the offertory.
At the conclusion of the mass the Arch
bishop imparted the Papal, benediction.
He received . a name above every v name.
Other men, as Moses, Joshua' and Lodrach,
saved their peoples in the hour of their need.
He is the , savior of saviors. . He saved all
mankind. The name of Jehovah is a name
above every name. Still it does not express
as great a number of the divine perfections as
the sweet name of Jesus.
j For thus humbling himself,, even to the
death of the cross. . he, ' as St. Paul says, re
ceived from God' a Â¦Â» name above every name,'
the name of Jesus." at which every knee shall
bend of those in heaven, on earth and under
the earth. . . '
Lessons That It Teaches.
To.be a savior it did not suffice him to pay
dearly for our salvation. \ He would Instruct us
both by word and example how to make sure
for ourselves our dearly bought freedom.
Hence the word of God dwelt amongst us. con
versing with men on the kingdom of his heav
enly father and. living a life as perfect as his
heavenly father^, that men might hear with
very ears and see with their very Â¦ eyes the
paths that lead to heavenly life. / â¢
For a truth, whatever can be said of Christ,
whatever of wondrous sublimity, of grandeur.
ot power, of grace and sweetness, it is said
of him because he is Jesus, which means
savior. |
To be a* savior the word was made flesh. If
Christ were God alone he could not have suf
fered and died. And if he were man alone
his sufferings and death could not have had
an infinite value. God therefore became man.
Having a body, God was chilled by the/winter's
blast and overpowered with the summer's
heat; his head was crowned with thorns: his
hands and feet were bored . with nails and his
side was pierced with a lance; finally he hung
lifeless to the cross.
The name of Jesus is certainly a most holy
name, because he who bears it Is the Incarnate
holiness' itself. The name of Jesus is again
most holy on account of him who bestowed it.
Christ did not receive his sacred name from
man or angel, he received it from his heavenly
father alone, f Originating thus in the divine
mind, and as it were spoken for the first time
iÂ« must be a name full of wondrous and sacred
meaning. Even human minds can express much
In a few words. It this be true of minds
finite, of minds which say unto themselves
"So far shalt thou go and no farther," then
truer. by far is it of the. divine mind. , .
Meaning of Holy Name.
Rev. Patrick J. Foote, S. J., was ac
corded the distinction of preaching the
sermon. Father Foote is a native of this
city J and a graduate of St. Ignatius Col^
lege. His sermon was extremely eloquent
and a learned exposition of tha doctrines
upon which the feast is founded, and why
it is of special Importance to the Society
of Jesus. He said in part:
Very Rev. John P. Frieden, S. J., was
the -celebrant. He was assisted by Rev.
George Butler, S. J., deacon; Rev. J. de
Rop,, S. J., su,bdeacon, arid. Rev. William
J. Culligan, S. J., master of ceremonies.
Rev. Henry Woods, S. J., was the assist
ant to the celebrant, j As deacons of
honor, Rev. J. Hickey, S. J., and Rev.
Joseph Landry, S. :J., occupied seats by
the throne of Archbishop Riordan, and
assisted" him. throughout the ceremonies.,
Rev. P.' J. Mulligan occupied a seat with
in the .sanctuarv. B ' :
The magnificent altar of St. Ignatius
Church was ablaze with light. On one
side an episcopal throne had been erected,
in which sat Archbishop Riordan, clad in
the robes of his office, and supported on
either side by members of the Jesuit
order. â¢ Â¦ The officiating priests were clad in
vestments of "cloth of gold; and numerous
acolytes, censers and thurifers presented
a scene of moving colors, as each part of
the mass was read. . . v
j Solemnly impressive were the services
which marked the celebration of the feast
of the Holy Name of Jesus yesterday at
St. Ignatius Church. As the Society of
Jesus takes its name from this occasion;
it^ is one: of the; ' most important in the
history' of the order; Since St. ; Ignatius
of Loyala first organized the Society of
Jesus,. this date has been celebrated' each
year with increasing fervor and devotion.
The two were engaged in hauling a load
of wood down the summit road to their
home, which Is in that vicinity, when the
brake gave way and the wagon rushed
on the horses. This frightened the ani
mals, and they started at a furious gate.
The elder Moody jumped and landed in
brush twenty feet below the road, receiv
ing a number of injuries. His son hung
en to the lines and made an effort to
stop the team. The grade was a heavy
one and the big wagon gained impetus,
the frightened animals running at full
speed. At a sharp turn in the road the
outfit went over the embankment and
rolled down a distance of 300 feet into the
gorge. Young Moody was thrown from
the rig and landed at the bottom in some
brush and rocks. He received a deep
gash in the head and some bruises about
the body. The wagon was smashed to
splinters. One of the horses was killed,
but the others escaped with minor inju
ries.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 19.â While hauling wood
in the hills back of Saratoga, fifteen
miles west of this city, a four-horse team
belonging to C. H. Moody became unman
ageable and plunged 300 feet over a moun
tain grade. That Moody and his 16-year
old son, William, were not killed is al
most a miracle. : *

There is only one way to purify the blood,
only one -way to increase flesh, .and that is
through the stomach and digestive organs.
Why? Because the stomach and digestive or-
gans make blood and flesh, bone, nerves and
sinew. Did you ever see a person blessed with
a healthy,- vigorous stomach and digestion who
had Impure blood, muddy, sallow complexion,
or who had weak nerves, sleepless nights and
the thousand and one pains and aches arising
from poor digestion? No, because perfect di-
gestion converts the'food eaten into pure blood,
strong nerves and muscles, and all tha fiesh
a person needs to have for health, symmetry
and beauty.
Every : person knows whether or not his or
her digestion is what It should be. but every
person does not know what is j the safest and
best way to secure and preserve a healthy
condition of tha digestive organs. It Is not
dona by tha : usa of any wonderful secret
patent medicine, but by tha use of certain
harnVess dlgestiva principles, which, taken at
meals, will digest tha food anyway, regardless
of tha weak condition of tha stomach.
' Dr. Brooks recommends a combination of
vegetable essences^ fruit salts, . pura aseptic
pepsin and ' Golden Seal, prepared | In conven-
ient tablet form, and sold by druggists every-
where under tha name of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets. * â¢
Thesa pleasant tasting tablets are to ba dis-
solved In the mouth after each meal, and.
mingling in the food In the stomach, digest it
perfectly. There is nothing wonderful about
this. Any physician or chemist knows that
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will do this be-"
cause repeatedly tested and proved, and thou-
sands of cured dyspeptics have found it to be
true also. â¢
Dr. Harlandson states that these tablets
Increase flesh because they digest flesh-form-
ing food like eggs, meat and ordinary every-
day food; for the same reason they purify the
blood and strengthen weak nerves. In no other
way can it be done, because flesh, blood and
nerves are obtained from the food we eat.
Dr. Jennlson once stated that he believed
a CO-cent package of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets would give more real benefit that fifty dol-
lars' worth of ordinary doctor's fees.
These . tablets may. ba found at any drug

They invigorate the stomach, make pure
blood and strong nerves in the only way that
nature can do it, and that Is from plenty of
wholesome food, well digested. It la not what

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will digest food
if placed In a' Jar or bottle in water heated
to 98 degrees, and they will do it much more
effectively when taken into the stomach after
meals, whether you have faith that they will
or not.
' Mere faith will not digest' your food for
you, will not give you an appetite, will not
increase your flesh and strengthen your nerves
and heart, but Stuart's Dyspepsia. Tablets
will do these things, because they are com-
posed of the elements of digestion;^ they con-
tain the Juices, acids and peptones necessary
to the digestion and assimilation of all whole-
some food.
Nevertheless, the most common of all dis-
eases, Indigestion, and stomach troubles, which
in turn cause nervous diseases, heart troubles,
consumption, and the - loss of flesh, requires
something besides faith to cure.
This is especially true In nervous troubles,

In another way, also, the heart is affected

Poor digestion also poisons the blood, makes
it thin and watery, which irritates and weak-

the prompt assimilation of food.
This can best be done by the regular use

ARE YOU THIN?
Do Yon. Want to Become Fleshy P
Heeded.
A FEW SIMPLE RULES.
Flesh and Not Fat Is What 13
What thin people want la flesh, and not fat.
To be symmetrical and properly proportioned
every person should have a certain amount of
flesh. To be plump does not necessarily mean
to be fat. Fat is undesirable; it' clogs and
retards tha action of every muscle, Interferes
with tha healthy action of the heart and lungs,
and when excessive predisposes to fatty degen-
eration of vital organs, to say nothing of the
discomfort, more or less, resulting from ex-
cessive adipose tissue.
Common sense would suggest that If one
wishes to become fleshy and plump, the thing
most needed would be flesh- forming foods; in
other words, albuminous foods, like eggs,
beef, oatmeal, etc. Tha kinds of food that
make flesh are the foods that form the greater
part of our dally bill of fare.
Now. the only reason so many people re-
main thin is because their stomachs do not
properly and' completely digest and assimilate
the flesh-forming beefsteak and eggs we eat
every day.
There are thousands of such people, and
they are really dyspeptic, although they may
not suffer any particular pain or inconvenience
from their stomachs. If such persons wouli
take, with their meals, some preparation like
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, the food would be
quickly digested, and the proper degree of
plumpness very soon secured, because these
tablets are prepared exactly for that purpose,
they will digest every variety of flesh-forming
food, which Is the sole reason why . they so
quickly build up and strengthen thin, dyspep-
tic men and women.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets cure dyspepsia,
and every form of indigestion on this com-
mon sense plan, that they digest the food
promptly, giving strength to every nerve and
organ of the body, while at the same time tha
stomach has a chance to rest and recover ita
natural vigor. Nothing further is required to
cure any stomach trouble, or to make thin,
dyspeptic people strong, plump and well.
This excellent preparation is manufactured
by F. A. Stuart Co.." Marshall, Mich., and
sold by druggists everywhere at 50 centa per
package.

There are a large number of universities and insti
tutions in Europe endowed for the purpose of sup
porting men of science. and learning. Their chairs
are frequently occupied by exceptional men, but as a
rule those favored creatures did not receive the.fa
vors until they had first won success before the larger
audience of the world. Moreover, the chances are
that if an exceptional man such as Marconi were
provided with an income to devote himself to study,
he would not be half so eager or so successful in his
experiments as Marconi has been under circum
stances that compel him. to succeed or starve. ?
Mr. Carnegie's institution is going.' to do a great

such men to work under conditions so favorable that
they will' 'succeed 'where they would otherwise "'. have
failed. Their work, moreover, is going to add iti the
aggregate an, immense sum to the world's: st^fe of
knowledge. To humanity itself then, as well as to the
recipients of his favors,' "Mr. Carnegie's giftlis t o . be" ;
beneficial; but it -is not going to find the exceptional
nnr to hel.n him: much v wheri -'found. That class
- The intention of the founder is undoubtedly excel
lent, but it is safe to say that if his institution depend
for success upon finding the exceptional man it will
accomplish very little for the money with which he
has endowed it. The manager of every important in
dustry in this country is searching! for the excep
tional man. Every university ; is looking ! for him.
Every political party is on his trail. The church
wishes him, the banks long for him and literature
has been yearning for him for many a year. The ex
ceptional man in farf would not have to apply, to
Mr. . Carnegie's institute for financial aid to â¢ enable
him to devote his, life to the work for- which he is
best fitted. In fact, whether he be a Marconi, a
Paderewski or a Morgan, the exceptional man who
is not ahead of his time, nor behind it, never fails to
get bigger pay from the public than any the Carnegie
institution will ever be able to offer him; and if he
be ahead of his time, it is not easy to see how the
very conservative gentlemen who control the insti
tution are ever going to be able to recognize him.
MR. .CARNEGIE, in stating the objects for
which he has founded, the new institution at
Washington,' says it will be one of the pur
poses of the trustees and managers to "discover the
exceptional man in every department of study, when
ever and wherever found, and enable him by financial
aid to make the work for which he seems specially de
signed his life work." Â¦ "

Having once started 'upon the wrong path, the
custom has become more and more, evil.; There is
no more reason why the Government should furnish
the people with free seeds than with free vegetables.
The distribution interferes with a legitimate indus
try and seriously handicaps if! Mr.' Squash's bill is
a suggestion of what we are coming to if some check
is not put upon the increasing evil. If we are going
to give anybody free seed we should give- everybody
free seed, and thus, as Mr. Squash proposes, put an
end to the seed industry altogether. ' â. V \
The provisions of the bill are not any' more ex
travagant than the operations of the free seed dis
tribution by the Government.' Originally the .dis
tribution was designed for the, purpose of introducing
new and better seeds among the farmers of- the
country. That intention has long since been lost
sight of. The seeds now distributed so far from be
ing better than the farmer could . obtain from a
country grocery are probably worse.' The ; distribu
tion, in fact has become an immense job,- and in its
operations frauds of various kinds are continually
coming to light.

THE 'British Admiralty is about to apply the office gag to naval officers who
violate section 637 of the navy regulations of 1S79. which forbid the publica
tion, directly or indirectly, of any matter or thing relating to the public ser
vice. Admiral Sir John Hopkins is the first officer to incur the disapproval
of the Admiralty. \ He had proposed a certain series of lectures before the
United Service Institution, but the journal committee declined to have them deliv
ered, as the Admiralty had intimated in no uncertain language that it did not ap
prove of the proposed lectures. The queer thing about this Incident is that -Sir
.: John 'Hopkins was a naval lord hlmself-aÂ»few years ago, and. that- he is therefore -
cognizant of the Admiralty being averse "to-having- its shortcomings exposed or
. criticized, and it is just possible that this \ gag applied to Admiral Hopkins is a
strong intimation to Rear Admiral Beresfbrd, who- has freely criticized the British
'navy system, to cease his attacks and comply with, the instructions and regula
' tions governing the navy. ' Â¦ Â¦
There Is some doubt about a drydock being constructed by the British Govern
ment at Simons Town. South Africa, as it has been pointed out that such a work,
. owing to engineering difficulties, would cost at least $15,000,000. The rock is unsuit
able for the dock and the material has to be brought from Norway. It Is further
shown that the place cannot be fortified and that the bay is exposed to southeast

â¢ Three notable cruisers in the French navy are to be stricken off the active list
after long and efficient service. One is the Duquesne, - of ' 5986 tons, and another
the Tourville, of 5578 tons, both bulit in 1S76. They are iron vessels sheathed with
wood, and have been employed almost constantly on foreign service In preference
Â¦ to later ships, the bottoms of which were not coppered. The Duquesne has been
twice in- San Francisco harborâ in 18S6 and again in 1891 â and was twice docked at
Mare Island. The -ship drew 28 feet 6 inches when she entered 'the dock and expe
rienced no difficulty in getting up to the navy yard, where it is now asserted that
ships, of our navy drawing four to five feet less water are unable to navigate. The
Duquesne will be remembered as a stately, handsome and commodious ship, of
good and reliable speed and economical steaming.. She was the connecting-link
between the old and the new navy, and more serviceable than the average mod
ern production with high paper speed. The third vessel, the Ipnlgenle, also con
structed of iron and wood, is of 3431 tons,. was built In 1881 and has been used con
stantly as a training ship. These three ships are tb be utilized as colliers, and as
such are capable of serving for another quarter of a century, as tjie hulls are of
unusually strong material and well put together.
I Two torpedo-boats In the Franch navy, the Siroco and Mistral, built by Nor
mand, have armored dec^ks over the engine and 'â¢ boiler compartments. The flat
deck is .35 of an inch in thickness, and the inclined part, extending ten Inches be
low the waiter line, is .94 of an inch thick. As a further strength to the boat, and
to obviate the danger of buckling, there is an inner keel, or, properly, keel
son, thirteen inches in depth, extending through half the length of the vessels.
The weight of the armor, which Is of nickel steel, and the keelson is twenty-four
tons, or nearly one-sixth of the total displacement. Â¦ ."

Germany is pushing her shipbuilding programme with such vigor as to com
plete it four years hence, instead of in 1916, as originally Intended. Unless this
activity is suddenly checked the German fleet will consist in 1906 of thirty-eight
battleships, of which thirty-one are built; fourteen armored cruisers, including
twelve built, building or authorized, and thirty-eight smaller cruisers of which
thirty-three are built, completing or authorized. ' Fifteen of the above named
classes of ships are under. construction, and new ships are provided for in tha
. budget for 1902. The expenditures on new phips and armament are estimated at
$18,791,500. Simultaneous with the increase of ships is the addition to the person
. nel, viz., one vice admiral, thirteen captains,', eight commanders, six lieutenant
commanders, twenty-eight lieutenants and eighteen ensignsâ a total increase of
seventy-six commissioned deck officers, and a proportionate addition of staff, war
rant officers, cadets and general crew.
Japan established a new naval station, named Maiguru, on the west coast of
Nippon on October 1 last. Vice Admiral Togo is commandant of the station, with

There h not much change in the local market.
Prices in the main have gone up and down in sym
pathy with the Eastern centers, though fluctuations
in this market are always slower and narrower than
in the East and West, where the prices undergo, vio
lent changes almost daily. The weather has been
the principal factor for several weeks and will con
tinue so until the crop prospects become more defi
nitely defined. The merchants as. a rule report.busi
ness active and at profitable figures, collections are
ss good ns they ever are, and the banks, both city and
country, have large /lines ofvrnone.y to loan at easy
rates of interest The State was never- on a more
satisfactory commercial basis than it is to-day.
Against this bullish exhibit, however, there is a
general lowering of prices among the leading staples.
Bradstreets calls it "the usual January thaw." Cer
tainly the plane of vslues is lower than at the be
ginning of the year. The list of lower commodities
includes securities, the minor cereals, pork products,
dairy lin-s and coffee and sugar, not . to mention
copper, tin and hides, specified above. Stocks of
provisions in the Wesi are increasing, and the pack
ers are operating with more attention to demand
and supply than the calls of speculation. The bears
en the New York Coffee Exchange succeeded in
breaking the market, being aided by enormous re
ceipts at Brazilian ports and by much larger stocks
;n American hands, the increase being 150 per cent
over the same time last year. The car shortage con
tinues to hamper Irdde, though the situation seems
to be slowly improving. There is room for improve
ment in this direction, for, as already pointed out,
the dearth of cars has cut down the movement of
produce and merchandise considerably during the
past year. ;^iP
The cast reports a better movement in textile
goods, though the new prices for woolens are rather
lower than anticipated. The iron and steel trade
keeps up its rapid gait, and some lines show still
further advances, though there 1 is a disposition
among tfas more conservative houses in the trade to
frown on increased prices at the moment. Sales of
pig iron have been heavy, and more or less scarcity
of this product is noted. Finished products tend
higher, but copper and tin are lower. Shipments of
boots and shoes continue large, and the factories have
marked up their quotations 2 i / 2 (q>5c, though the
wholesalers have not yet made a corresponding in
crease in prices. Hides are weaker.
The general distributive trade of the country; was
jeported good. Comrncrcial reports expressed it as
"certainly improved." .There was a larger spring
business in cotton and woolen goods,. and the North
west sent in large orders for agricultural goods and
dry goods. The Wesi reported an increased spring
jobbing demand, with easy collections. The South
west lagged somewhat, owing to continued dry
weather in the winter wheat belt, where complaints
of crop damage are being made, though they do not
thus far indicate serious injury and would be imme
diately discontinued by a good rain. The lack of
lain in California has also been attracting attention
and h?.s been a factor in wheat prices for a week
or more.
IN spite of another decrease in bank clearings last
week, general trade was reported better. The
decrease in the clearings was slight, being only
D/ per cent as compared with the corresponding
week in 1901, and New York and Boston were the
only important cities to show a falling off, that at
New York being 17.7 per cent and that at Boston
1 per cent. The other large centers exhibited sub
stantial gains, the aggregate falling off being charge
able to the small places! The failures were 341,
ligainsj J40 last year, and were not of national im
portance. . .' Â¦ 'â¢ \

MONTAGUE LESSLER, a! young lawyer without' a fortune, who defeated'
Perry Belmont, millionaire and society man, in the race for Congress, Is
only 33, years of age, while his recent rich opponent is 49. He is noted
as a Republican spellbinder, and has been much in demand aa a Speaker
* ' in all the recent campaigns, and his friends have.no doubt that he will
assert himself in the halls of Congress. This was his first run for office. He is a
native New Yorker and a graduate of the College of the City of. New York and
of the Columbia Law School. > '. .' . ,
Belmont, who expected an easy victory over the young . Republican candidate,
is unique in New York .social and political life. As the eldest son of August Bel
mont he inherited a fortune. He has increased it in Wall street.
As a young man he was one of the foremost figures of. society. . In his bache
lor days he gave at least three dances a season, and they were always among the
smartest functions of society. Many notable dinner parties were, given at the
house. Perry Belmont was always fond of dinners and dances. . .
All the time he was going in for -politics. He had high " ambitions, and. was
regarded as a very bright young man, and with his wealth was picked out as a
winner. He went to the convention and spent his spare time making political
acquaintances. He got his first nomination for Congress in 1880. He served four
terms, and was chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. Cleveland made
him Minister to Spain in 1889. . . ! ;\ . Â¦ '.

With a campaign like that to be undertaken' it is
clear that 'something more is needed than culture
and scholarship. The colonel has acted wisely in
calling upon the shockheads to come to the front.

that glows like a furnace. A single sentence ! will
suffice to give a taste of its quality.-. The ' s colonel
says: "The time is coming again, when, Old Hick
dry's spirit still leading the way, brave men are to
fight to rescue their Government from the clutches
of a body of robber barons^ who, already! strongly
intrenched in positions surrendered to them by a
succession of ' blunders and mischances incident to
faulty Democratic leadership, propose to erect a line
of robber castles from Havana to Manila; from San
Juan, in Porto Rico, to Honolulu, in Hawaii, finding
the law for it in "the imprudent pretension that 'Con

has the colonel been 'more eloquent than in appealing
to the shockheads of- to-day; to", emulate the deeds of
their predecessors. Speaking 'of the ; men who fought

W. Edmund Idle, after an unbroken ser
vice as librarian at Mudle's, has retired.
To an interviewer the other day he said
that Mudie's library consisted of 1000 vol
umes in a small shop in Upper Kins
street when he first joined It. It now
comprises over a million, and its subscrib
ers number over 23,000. The daily issue at
books averages 10,000. The publication of
volumes three a,nd four of Macaulay's
"History of England" was a Â«,reat day for
Mudle's. The volumes were sold at a high,
price, but Mudie bought 2500 sets, and it
was this spirited action that lifted the
library into fame.
After she has once come to this conclu
sion nothing shakes her belief in it. Tha
operation, however, is a very long one.
Few of her books are finally ready for
publication to the world under four years
from the time when she has first con
ceived the plot and characters.
Mrs. Craigle's method of work is to
keep three or four books going at once.
She conceives her plot, then thinks and
rethinks it out until she is quite certain
that so far as her knowledge extends it
'is true in fact and in theory.
Pour Years on a Novel.
As yet ping-pong can hardly be said to
have a history, but it does not lack his
torians. Even the poets have got hold of
ping-pong, for there is a poem in its hon
or in this week's Onlooker.
Mrs. Craigie ("John Oliver Hobbes") ia
at present engaged on a new comedy. She
says she is much faselnated with writing
for the stage, . though she feels a novel
gives an author far more freedom than
one possibly can have when bound by the
conventions which exist in the theater,
both on account of the essential limita
tions of the drama and also through the
idiosyncrasies of various managers.
It may sound rather alarmins â but is
nevertheless true that we are being
launched into a sea of ping-pong litera
ture. Â¦ Several ' ; publishers told â¢ me they
are . considering or had promised the
publication iof books oh the game by cer
tain players. In fact, my inquiries a3 to
what is likely to be the first book on a
new list in several cases was in a word
ping-pong.
Fisher Unwin means to be the first to
get out a handbook. It is by Arnold Par
ker, the winner in the recent tournament
at Queen's Hall. The book will contain
all there is at present to be told about
the game, which is quite in its infancy,
from the way- to hold the racket to the
manner of commanding the >ball In order
to make it deceive yoar adversary . by
twisting in all manner of unexpected di
rections. The book will be illustrated with
numerous diagrams.
Flood of Ping-Pong Literature
"While waiting for war a nation can do
many worse things than play cricket and
football. ' .
While the satirist must always exag
gerate a little, even the mildest critics
consider that Kipling here and there goes
too far. For example, the taunt that the
colonial rides and shoots better than me
islander hit hard and brought many re
plies. It is pointed out that In Australia
and Canada a horse costs less than a
bicycle, and running game is plentiful,
while in England deer shooting and hunt
ing are for the rich only.
As to the "flanneleo? fools" and "mud
dled oafs," the private soldier Is even^
more furious than the officer, who indeÂ«sil'
expresses himself with more contempt
than anger. Football and cricket, it la
pointed out on all sides, are In a way al
most as much mimetic warfare as volun
teering, and certainly produce men of
finer physique.
After gathering all the various opinions
together in the press and elsewntre the
indignation against Kipling appears to be
pretty strong.
The event of the literary week-tias un
doubtedly been the publication of Kip
ling's new "battle rally," as It has been
called. "The Islanders" is a satire upon
England's carelessness about the war an 1
devotion to sports.

There will be no question of the soundness of the
President's views. An indorsement of the Lodge bill
does not carry with it any wholesale^condemnation
of the. service as it stands! Every one recognizes that
among our consuls. are many who are not inferior to
the consuls of any foreign nation. The aim of the
bill is simply to provide a means of raising the whole
service to that high standard. â¢ :
It will be remembered that in his message to Con
gress President Roosevelt warmly indorsed the pro
posed reforms. In referring to them he said: "They
are based upon the just principle that appointments
to the service should be governed by trustworthiness,
adaptability and zeal in the performance of duty, and
that the tenure of office should be unaffected by par
tisan considerations.' The guardianship and fostering
of our rapidly expanding foreign commerce, the pro
tection of American citizens resorting to foreign
countries in the lawful pursuit of their affairs and the
maintenance the of the nation abroad
combine to make '\\ essential that our consuls should
be men of character, knowledge and enterprise."
The biil ; provides for classifying the service into
four grades of consuls general and siK grades of con
suls. The salary of each grade is. fixed by the bill
and in the highest amounts to $10,600 a year'' The
fee. system is abolished except in a few cases which
are specially provided for. The present consular;
dfficers are to retain their places, but within a year
the classification is to be put into effect. After classi
fication consuls will be recalled gradually for exam
ination, and those who fail to prove their fitness will
be dropped from the service. Promotions are to be
by merit and consuls will be transferred from one
class to another" as the good of the service. demands.
In brief, the bill aims at retaining all that is efficient
under the present system while eliminating incom
petent officials and preventing other incompetents
from entering.
Such being the case, there has long been a demand
for reform. The demand has been met by the in
difference of "some Congressmen and' by the objec
tion of others to give up any, of the remaining spoils
of office. The demand, however, has steadily in
creased in emphasis and force; and it seems it can
no longer be evaded or denied. At the present .time
Senator Lodge has before Congress a bill which has.
received the indorsement of many of the most. in-,
fluential and authoritative commercial bodies in the
country, and with the support derived from them it
appears , probable the measure will be enacted into
law at this session.
The irregularity of the service is due partly to the
methods by which consuls are selected, and partly
to the rules under which they work and are paid.
Our consular offices are a part of the spoils of Fed
eral politics. The result is that, while we frequently
obtain able men for such positions, we not . infre
quently get a. man who is merely a party henchman
having no idea of what a consul should know or
what he should do. Complaints have been made by
traveling Americans that many of our consuls whom
they meet abroad are not only incompetent, but are
not even well educated or well bred. . Our merchants
and manufacturers have found, too, in many cases,
that consuls do not attend to their business as they
should, and that our trade with foreign ports is hin
dered by their neglect or worse.
>^""N UR consular service, like every other branch
( . I of governmental achninstration, is marked by
*j extraordinarily good work in some instances
and by the opposite in others. It . abounds' with
illustrations of the well-known truth 'that good men
will do good work -under any system, while worth
less men will never do good work. Foreigners have
praised the efficiency of the service and commended
it for imitation by their home 'Governments. On the
other, hand Americans have frequently found cause
for condemning the' serA'ice and for calling upon
Congress for a radical reform in the method of con
ducting it. v â¢.

deal of pressure was brought to bear last
vear to point out to the committee the
error of its way, but the rule stood pat,
and on the night of the ball the dear
men stood askance in their dress suits,
wondering at their gloves and the ladies.
The latter, however, sallied up to thÂ«
dress suits repeatedly with the most soul
stirring speeches, while the men had not
the faintest idea who was addressing
them and could only smile and say noth
ing. Still, how lovely for the ladies!

OFFICERS' ASSOCIATION.
The sodalities attached. to the Jesuit
church of St. Ignatius are perfecting
plans for the erection of a new building
to accommodate their growing needs. This
project has been under consideration for
some time, but now it is assuming defi
nite shape. At the sodality mass yester
day morning Rev. Father Hickey, spir
itual director of the organization, ex
plained the nature and scope of what It
was proposed to do. A lot has been do
nated by the Very Rev. John P. Frieden,
superior of the Jesuits on this coast, on
the corner of Hayes and Franklin streets
Upon this it is the intention to erect a
structure that in every respect will be
worthy- of the purpose for which It Is to
be used and also stand as a monument to
the zeal and piety of the members.
First, it will contain a chapel, sum
ciently large to meet all requirements. It
will be the endeavor to make it the most
beautiful one in the city. The ladies and
gentlemen will share the chapel Jointly.
Next will be a library and reading room.
At the present time the sodalities have a
very fine library, but on account of ihe
constant addition of new books the sheiv
ingf capacity is Insufficient. It Is the .ob
ject to make the .â rary one of the most
select and well-appointed in the posses
sion of any similar institution.
In the general plan the younger mem
bers wil not be overlooked. There will be
a billiard room and a gymnasium up to
date in every detail, where they may
spend their time in a perfectly healthful
and moral atmosphere.
The cost â¢ is estimated at about $60,COu.
Both sodalities have , a. membership of
1500. Each member Is pledged for a cer
tain amount monthly. It is expected
everything will be ready to begin build
ing in the very near future. Father
Hickey is being ably assisted in supervis
ing the details of the plan by Father Cal
zia, director of the Ladles' Sodality, and
James R. Kelly, prefect of the Gentle
men's Sodality.

Each of Erin's thirty-two counties will
be represented at the fair by some special
feature. - An attempt will be made to
represent the work, achievements, home
life and customs of the Irish people. The
fair will probably last a week, and each
night an interesting and instructive pro
gramme of Gaelic songs, speeches and
recitations will be rendered. The fair
will be given on an " elaborate scale and
a large hall, probably the Mechanics'
Pavilion, will be secured.
The alumnae of St. Peter's Convent
held a meeting yesterday afternoon and
decided to do everything in their power
to make the festival a memorable suc
cess. The young ladies voted to work in
conjunction with the sisters of the con
vent, so that by their combined efforts a
more attractive and extensive display
might be made. The sisters are planning
to give a garden party in order to raise
money to defray the expense of their ex
hibit. All the societies of St. Peter's
Church, including the League of the
Cross, will -assist in the fair, and outside
talent will be secured. The parishioners
claim that this is the first time that a
real Irish fair has ever been contemplat
ed In this city, and they intend to make
the festival one that will not soon be
forgotten. ' *
The parishioners of St Peter's Catholic
Church on Alabama street, near Twenty
fourth are contemplating the holding of
a grand Irish fair for the purpose of rais
ing sufficient money to liquidate the
church debt. The proposition was sug
gested for the first time yesterday morn
ing at the 10:30 o'clock mass .but already
preparations are under headway. Plans
are not yet fully matured, but the par
ishioners intend to make the festival a
brilliant affair, fully commensurate with
the fame of the Irish people as enter
tainers. ' â¢ .

On their last meeting at San Rafael
Smith and MacGavin won handily. They
again downed their opponents yesterday,
but only after a close struggle. The
score in favor of Smith and MacGavin
was 9-7, 6-1, 5-7. The winners could have
won by a much larger margin had they
resorted to "lobbing" more. The first set
was exceedingly close, but^in the second
set Collier and Crowell did not figure at
all. Smith and MacGavin had a lead of
4-1 in the last set, but eased up and their
opponents, taking heart, won out, 7-5.
The features of the match were the terri
fic smashing of Smith, and MacGa%'in's
swift and well-placed drives.
MacGavin and James Code also beat
Collier and Crowell, the score being 7-5. .
In a long contest Percy Williams and
Frank Stnngham beat Sidney Salisbury
and George Whipple, the score being
6-4. 4-6, 6-3. 7-5. Whipple and Stringham

was 6-4, 6-4, 3-6.

manv of the letters written to England
by those aboard her proved anything but
a handy sea boat She is a new sWp, this
being her maiden commission. She car

be seriously disturbed.

Americas winning by a score of 4 to 2.
This ends the successful season of winter,
baseball.
The game was .remarkably fast for.
seven innings, which were played in less
than fifty-Uve minutes. The fielding was
sharp and accurate, . and , it seemed the
Nationals must win.
They scored their first run !n the open
ing inning. Van Haltren was given a
pass to first., stole second and went to
third on Hulin's sacrifice. Mertes walked." Â¦
Lee singled, forcing Mertes at second and
scoring Van Haltren. ,-Beckley. ; singled..*
Steinfeldt hit to Mercer, who fumbled the
ball, filling the bases. ' McHale went out
at first, retiring- the side.
The Nationals scored again In the third.
Hulen >was out at first. Mercer singled
and stole second. He scored on Lee's
two-bagger. Beckley and Steinfeldt were
out at first, retiring the side. - Â¦ Â¦
Mertes scored the third and last run
for the Nationals in the eighth on a
close decision. Hulen flew out. Mertes
"slammed the ball to the left-fleH fence.
Lee was out at first. Beckley singled to
the center-field fence. Mertes started
home from second. Davis, who was play
ing behind the bat for the All-Americas.
had the ball, but Umpire ' McDonald
called I Mertes safe on the ground that
Davis did not touch' him. Mertes ap
parently thought he was out, as he start
ed for his position in the field. .
The All-Americas scored their first run
in the third Inning. Bernhard started
proceedings with a two-bagger; Pickering
flew out. Barrett was passed to first
and Mercer singled, filling the bags. La
joie was next up. He flew to deep center
and Bernhard scored on the throw-in.
Davis ended proceedings by flying out.
The All-Americas did not score again
until the eight. Bernhard was out at
first. Lee lost control of the ball, walk
ing Pickering, Barrett and Mercer. Lajoie
again came to the bat with the bases full.
He went through the same performance
as before, flying out to deep center.
stead of trying to, put speed into it he
would probably have won the game. The
fielders played an errorless game behind
him and would readily have accounted
for any hits obtained off him.
The field was â¢ heavy from Saturday's
rain, but this did not interfere with the
players apparently.
The. men who have become popular fa
vorites here were all applauded as they
went to the bat. Barrett, the great little
center fielder; Bradley, the brilliant third
baseman; Lajoie, Van Haltren. Mertes,

THE DAY'S DEAD,
Friends of the proposition to aid "the
Cubans by tariff concessions have not
seen lit to bring forward," in such a way
as to impress the members of Congress,
a clear and accurate statement of social
and economic conditions on the Island.
The presentation of the Cuban , side has
been weak. Advocates I of < concessions
have not been frank in their i statements:
nor have they been prepared to adhere
to their original arguments. Â¦â¢ :-;
One of the most important points made
by the friends of the Cubans before Con
gress met was that unless Congress
granted a large reduction on sugar duties
before Christmas many , of , the , estates
would stop grinding cane. " This, it was
said,: would throw Into idleness many
thousands of Cubans, and in consequence
political disturbances would occur which
might put the island into a state of . an
archy.- Congress has not acted yet and
the Cuban estates are still grinding sugar
Undoubtedly many of them . are : grinding
it at. a loss, but the extravagant state
ments that were made early in the sugar
campaign have Injured the cause
The trouble is said to be entirely In the
House of Representatives., CThe Senate Is
inclined to give the Cubans what they
need. . Senator Platt of Connecticut, him
self an ardent protectionist, sees the ne
cessity, of acting, and ; he ; is convinced
that no injury will be done to r fanning
and beet sugar industries. '. But before
the Senate will act it, will wait* a reason
able time to see what will be the outcome
ln .- tl } e ? ouse - The House hesitates under
the leadership of Nebraska and Michigan
members. ; ! -â¢â¢.- Â¦.;Â¦.Â¦: Â¦ ';-,'â¢â¢ >
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Jan/ 19.â The devel
opments of last week show that there
may be some doubt about Congress grant
ing to Cuba even . such a concession as
a 25 per cent tariff reduction. The beet
sugar men, who early in the contest
showed a disposition j to compromise, are
now . opposing all - compromise, insisting
that the duty shall remain where it is.
The result of their altered tactics is Just
now causing a flurry In Congress.
The great rival of the sugar trust, the
Beet Sugar Association, has made a fight
against the sugar trust, so that in nearly

TACOMA, Wash., Jan. ,19. â S. Thornton
Langley, a pioneer miner of Rossland, 6.
C, has obtained possession of a lost gold
ledge in Okanogan County which is likely
to make him, a millionaire several tlme3
over. It was ; formerly known as the
Okanogan mine, - but ls now called the
Oroville. The property comprises a four
foot ledge of free gold ore, carrying val
ues of forty to forty-two dollars per tonÂ»
After its exploitation In 1898 by a mining
expert . a ten-stamp mill was erected and
5000 ; feet Of development work was done.
The surface -part of the vein to a depth
Â¦ji sixty feet was blocked out and put
through a mill, yielding a net profit of
$35,000.
The vein. was then lost and the prop
erty was abandoned after an expenditure
of $20,000 in a vain endeavor to relocate
it Langley alone of the original com
pany declared he would not give it up.
After much effort he inllsted the support
of capital in the East last fall and two
months ago started operations. Within
thirty days he rediscovered the missing
ledge, taking out .ore that is speckled
with gold.
With the machinery now being Installed
the company will handle 600 tons month
ly at Â«. cost not to exceed $7 per ton. This
will leave a net monthly profit of $20,000.
More machinery will be added with the
object of doubling this output.

The soldiers who gave the flag to the
church are: F. S. Brown, Alex- Wagner
Edward Norton, each of the First Regi
ment of California Volunteers; J. B. Say
Â«. Â«5. r Infantry; John McMil
len, Fifty-first Iowa, and Ben Sturges,
Thirty-first Infantry.
The congregation sang the national an
them, and religious exercises terminated
the ceremonies.
It was an Impressive ceremony, the
presentation of this patriotic gift to a
bouse dedicated to peace and religion, to
the teaching of good will toward all men
and the highest attainments that man can
reach. The soldier boys themselves con
ducted the service, while the pastor, the
Rev. Frank S. Ford, sat with the choir,
excepting when he offered the benedic
tions and accepted with gratitude the
beautiful ensign of the United States.
John McMillen. of the gallant Fifty-flrst
Iowa, impressively and with dignity took
the place of the pastor and said that there
were two causes for which a man may en
listâfor his God and for his country. In
introducing Che Rev. J. H. Macomber,
chaplain United States Army, retired. Pri
vate McMillen said: "I leave the presen
tation of our glorious nag to "this church
in the hands of a comrade in Christ and
a comrade in our country's service."
The Rev. Mr. Macomber said that the
dedication of a flag to a church was a
unique ceremony andr-he favored the idea
of giving the pennant place on the sa
cred walls. With eloquence and intense
feeling, which affected many in the vast
congregation, he described how. the first
dag was made by Betsy Ross and the pre
sentation of it to Congress and its ulti
mate adoption, but. more, he told of Its
glorious historyâ how it had spread under
its folds progress, civilization, equal
rights to all. It was baptized in blood
and marched on to victory; it had seen the
Union cemented when at one period it was
threatened, until now there was neither
North nor South nor East nor West, but
one common united family. It had taken
liberty to the oppressed in Cuba and in
the Philippines; they saw the flag, when
thys smoke of- battle cleared, in all its
beauty at the masthead of Dewey's ship
â when a deed was done that will be ever
remembered as one of the bravest achieve
ments of war. It was the mission of that
flag, it seemed, to lead on to victory ami
it remains wherever it goes. It opens a
way to a higher civilization and education.
Therefore, said he, it ought to have its
place in the house of God.
Roughing it on 'the battlefield does not
take from the soldier religious fervor, as
was evidenced last night, when some of
the brave boys who have seen service in
the Philippines presented a handsome
Ame ,rtcan flag to the Christian Church, on
Twelfth street, between Mission and
Howard.

Enjoy Time-Honored Ger
man Custom in Turks
Street Temple.
The San Francisco Turn Verein gave a
Fools' Festival last night at their hall on
Turk street. It was quite a novel affair,
given for the purpose of developing a
spJtk of good fellowship among those who
will attend the annual grand masquerade
tall of the organization which will be
held In Turn Verein Hall on the evening
of February 2L It is a time-honored cus
tom among the German turners to pre
cede their annual masquerade with a
Fools' Festival, and last night the mem
bers of the Verein, their families and
friends turned out in full force to partici
pate in the fun.
The pleasure seekers, all decorated in
foolscaps and gayly bespangled costumes,
presented a sight very similar to a Mardi
Gras festival. On the stage the committee
that had charge of the affair sat at a long
table and directed the fun. They were
all attired in different colored paper fools
caps and dominos. The guests were seat
ed arqund tables that were placed here
and there all over the hall. LJauid re
freshments were served freely and a gen
eral spirit of conviviality entered into the
evening's enjoyment. An excellent pro
gramme of musical and vocal specialties
and speechmaking entertained the guests.
The speechmakers talked from the top of
a huge wine cask that was standing on
the etage. It was safe to say that every
body who attended the fete had a good
time. The following committee had
charge of the festival:

A LOST LEDGE
It was fortunate that the wreck oc
curred on Sunday night. Had it hap
pened during business hours the losa of
life would have been appalling, as there
were approximately 200 persons employed
by the various firms. They would have
been caught in a veritable death trap and
crushed and burned before they could
have been rescued.
Experts who made an examination of
the ruins were unable to find evidences
of a gas explosion.
DETROIT, Mich., Jan. 19.â Four build
ings, each four stories high, located in the
heart of the wholesale district, collapsed
at S:30 o'clock to-night, without any ap
parent cause, and all that now remains
is a smouldering heap of ruins. The
buildings were occupied by five concerns.
Their stocks are "a total loss, which is
estimated at $152,000, exclusive of the less
on. the buildings, which amounts to $30.
400. The buildings joined each other at-the
corner of- Jefferson avenue ana sneioy
street. "
The losses: Maddox Glove Company,
$25,000; Imperial Cap Company, $15,0uO; F.
B. Neuhoit & Co.. stock of cotton goods.
$8000; Hills Bros, of New York, stock ot
commission goods, $70w); Michigan Pro
duce Company, $7500; Cruseo Bros., limit
ed, wholesale grocers, about $90,000.
No one seems to know what caused the
collapse of the buildings. On â¢ Sunday
night that district is practically deserted,
and the few who were in - the vicinity
say that the buildings seemed to fall into
a heap without apparent cause, making
a noise like the rumbling of distant thun
der. There are evidences of an explosion.
The walls of the rear -part of the Mad
dox Glove Company's building are still
standing to the height of two stories, but
the roof of this part of the building lies
turned bottom up in the middle of Shelby
street, and a large Iron smokestack lies
on the sidewalk on the opposite side of
the street, mashed against the buildings
there as If driven by force. "
The buildings collapsed into & heap and
in a short space of time the inflammable
material caught fire from the furnaces
used for heating the buildings.
There were no watchmen about the
premises, consequently there will be no
loss of life. No one was injured, nor is
there any one who can give a definite rea
son for the catastrophe.

while arother robber hastily unfastened
the belt he wore. The pair of thieves
made their escape.
The robbery was a bold one, consider
ing the fact that many people were on
the str.-t- t. but the act was done so
Quickly that Sullivan could not raise an
outcry in tUno to prevent the escape of
his assailants.

dredthsof an inch of rain fell here, be
tween midnight and 2 o'clock to-day,
after which the skies cleared and all in
dications of further precipitation disap
peared. .
Showers were quite general throughout
the section bordering on the coast, extend
ing : as '; far east" as San Bernardino and
south (to San Diego. The need of rain is
very great air over the southern part of
the State; especially on the ranges, where
it is said grass is becoming short.
While the' light showers of to-day fresh
ened vegetation to a certain extent, the
benefit.: will not be lasting unless more
moisture comes at once. The local weather
bureau states that , the barometer is ris
ing rapidly, with a west wind blowing,
making it extremely unlikely that fur
ther rainfair.will occur in^hls section for
the present at least. The total precipita
tion for the season is given out as 2.52,
which is far behind last season, when the
figures were 6.87 up to the corresponding
date. .
Heavy black clouds hung over the
mountains all day and it is said consider
! able snow has fallen in the high ranges
to the northeast. Redlands reports good
showers early to-day, with prospects of
more. At Santa Barbara rain began fall
ing at 9 o'clock last night and continued
In showers for several hours. .' Every drop
In ' that section is welcomed, but it is the
opinion of agriculturists that an unusual
amount ; of rain will be required to bring
about average conditions.
; - Santa Ana was wetted by about .15 of
an Inch after midnight, but the clouds
cleared away this morning and the storm
appears to be over. Many . other places
report showers which were soon drunk up
by the. thirsty earth. The weather to
night is clear and cool, with a" brisk wind.
. BAN BERNARDINO, Jan. 19.â Rain be
gan falling here about L o'clock this morn
ing and continued In frequent showers
until 9 o'clock, the total precipi
tation amounting to .16 of an inch. Since
9 o'clock the weather has been threaten
ing and indications are good for more
rain to-night and to-morrow. In the
mountains snow fell heavily, covering the
foothills nearly to the level of the valley.

at eight inches. â¢ â¢'. = â¢ . Â¦'â¢. Â¦: ;j\. â¢
SAN MIGUEL. Jan. 19.â After fifty-one
days of sunshine about a quarter of an

only .34 of an inch was recorded. For the
season thus far 1.44 inches, against 7.97

BRINGS SORROW
TO HIS FAMILY
Mpntan a Convict Forger
Is' Son of a Wealthy
New Yorker.- p.
BUTTE, Mont.. Jan. 19.â It has just been
disclosed that Launcellot G. R. Living
ston, the forger convict in the Montana
penitentiary on whose behalf a remark
able petition was sent to Governor Toole
a few days ago asking for a pardon, is
Gideon Granger, son of I. Albert Granger,
a prominent business man of. New York
City, and nephew of A. H. Granger, also
of that city, and former son-in-law of ex-
Commissioner of - Police . McClade. His
Identity | waa disclosed by the Investiga
tions made by. Governor. Toole when he
learned that : the mass of prominent
names on the petition for pardon were
forgeries, among the names being those
of President Roosevelt, Thomas A. Edi
son, Dr. Farkhurst and a score of other
prominent men of New York.
Livingston Is said to be a descendant of
Philip Livingston, one of the signers of
the Declaration of Independence, and . of
Gideon Granger, Postmaster General un
der William Henry Harrison. He was
also In Roosevelt's company of Rough
Riders in Cuba, and after the -war cam"
to â¢ Montana, where he resorted to an old
and familiar trick of his for raising money
'by. forging checks, for, which he is now
serving a five-year term in prison. A still
more interesting discovery concerning thg
convict has been made by a young woman
of Butte, who was formerly. Miss Myrtle
Clay bourne, daughter of a well-known cit
izen, now dead. A few weeks before Liv
ingston was arrested, last April, she met
him and knew him by the name of Gideon
R. Llngston. After a short ; acquaintance
she was ; persuaded, almost' forced, she
says, to marry him. but immediately after
the ceremony she fled from him, realizing
the mistake she had made. She never
saw him again and did not know what
had become of him until Â¦ she read of her
husband's name among the aliases of the
convict for whose pardon. the forged peti
tion was sent to the Governor. She start
ed an investigation to determine whether
the . convict and : her husband ; were one
and the Â£ame person, and soon convinced
herself of that. She has now began pro
ceedings to have her marriage annulled.

FORECAST,
WEATHER ; CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
IX)NDON, Jan. 19.â The feeling on the
Stock Exchange at the close of the past
week was decidedly, happy. .Whether or
not this was merely the upward end of
the financial. see-saw is hard to say; but
unless some unexpected discouraging
news arrives' from South Africa there is
a good prospect for a continued ! upward
movement. . . . .'' Â¦Â¦Â¦ â¢.;â¢ . .
Money has been easy and there is every
prospect that the -bank rate of discount
will be reduced to 3% per cent during the
next fortnight. This reduction is rendered
likely.: in , view of .the large Government
loan - which is regarded as Inevitable in
March or April; Jt is also probable that
there will be a Russian loan, in Paris in
the, spring, ai*! notably that England will
endeavor to strengthen the London mone
tary position as much as possible at that
time. Â¦ v â¢/Â¦Â¦â¢. â¢; '.<Â¦â¢â¢/;Â¦ .. '; :. â¢Â¦-Â¦ â¢ : '" '. Â¦
1 The peace rumors .which were circulated
as diligently on the Stock Exchange as
elsewhere have : helped the .boom, but the
latest ! Boer 'statements * emanating from
the continent indicate that these rumors
were circulated largely for the benefit of
the Stock Exchange. 'â¢Â¦"â¢.'Â»
- American securities did not share large
ly in the : recent \ upward movement; but
Grand Trunks were firmer. r South Ameri
cans were dull,' with the exception of
Uruguay bonds, which responded, to the
improved political outlook. Spanish fours
were weak and Rio-,Ttntos relapsed, in
sympathy with the break in. copper. -Â¦
Everybody appears to expect an im
mediate resumption.of prosperity In South
Africa with the close of the war and an
immense gold output. .' (.-',.;
: Those of conservative opinion, however,
agree that' any general laying down of
arms for some time to come is nat likely,
and that the long deferred peace with its
accompanying prosperity Is likely to have
to wait ' the slow process of attrition. -
BERLIN, Jan. 19.â The- Boerse has had
another very strong week. The first half
of the' week showed light transactions,
but values were well . maintained. The
latter half of the week exhibited uncom
mon strength and there were sharp ad
vances in, prices. -".->Â».; ; ~
A strong impulse was given to the
Boerse by Paris and London and particu
larly, by the boom in Kaffirs. The princi
pal domestic influences affecting the
Stock Exchange were the growing ease of
the money market, which culminated in
the . reduction . of the Reichsbank rate of
discount/ and the increasingly favorable
industrial reports. The -week's trading

Schmid said he answered an advertise

to the country, and 5 Fisher called upon
him Saturday evening, telling him he
wanted him to go to Stockton to work
for him. Schmid packed a few things in
a valise and went with Fisher to the
ferry to take the train to Stockton.
When they got to the ferry Fisher &ald
he had two horses to ship by the steamer
to Stockton, but he had no ready cash to
pay the freight. He asked Schmid if he
had any money and Schmid handed him
$3 all the coin he had with him. Fisher
told him he would be .fair . with him and
gave him a worthless check for $500 on
the Germania Trust Company to hold as
security. Fisher left Schmid, telling him
he would return in a few minutes. Schmid
waited for hours, but Fisher did not come
back. Â¦ ,

Thanksgiving night, November 25, 1897,
must remain green in the memory. of the
songstress, for it, was on that memora
ble national holiday that she came before
the footlights for the first time as prim a
donna, in the New England town* of
WoonsocKet. The opera, "The Maid of
Marblehead," was new, the . prima' donna
was new, the Â¦ name : of the company
smacked of newness and the authors and
composer, Newcombe, ' Brown and Macy,
were also on their theatrical or operatic
trial. Whether "The Maid of -Marble
head" was a success or not does not mat
ter. Maybe it came into existence to give
the aspirant to operatic fame a chance.
Certain it is that it was" her; chance,' for,
from that time her engagements have
been steadily increasing In 1 importance.
- TaV/TT aude LILLIAN BERRI, who
AV/\\ recently undertook the principal
II Vw \1 role in" "Princess Chic," which
A V JA. for a year or more was assumed
by Marguerite Sylva, is 'well
known in Sa,n Francisco and Fresno, her
home, as a talented vocalist and also as a
society favorite." Her marriage in 1894 to
Dr. Frank W. Fisher, a dentist and son
of G. W. Fisher, manager of the Puget
Sound Lumber Company, will be remem
bered. Both Mr. and Mrs. Fisher contin
ued, as in their single days, favored mem
bers of social .circles. Mrs. Fisher, en
couraged by her husband, determined to
take up the lyric stage as her profession,
and with that object in view left; for Chi
cago to begin earnest work, subsequently
reaching New'.York and Boston. .
Her- studies in New York were ' inter
rupted, however, by the untimely death of.
her husband, who contracted pneumonia
in its worst form. Nothing daunted, the
young Calif ornian pursued her studies
with greater fervor than ever, and joined
an-organization which was formed inBos
ton and was called the Colonial Â¦ Opera
Company. . Mrs. Fisher at last had the
chance she had worked forâ an appear
ance with a lyric company, even though
it was an absolutely new and untried or
ganization. ' 1 \

TALENTED CALIFORNIAN WHO WENT EAST TO STUDY SINGING
AND" NOW RETURNS AFTER SEVERAL YEARS' ABSENCE AS THE
STAR* OF A C.OMIC OPEhA COMPANY. Â¦ â¢ ' \
, The Southern Pacific Company allowed
no one to see Engineer Prouty at the Rail
road Hospital. â¢'Â¦â¢; : Â¦' â¢.
The wreck caused a delay of about two
hours to all the'. east bound trains and a
gang of ' men was busy all day yesterday
clearing away, the debris. ' .
, Assistant Manager Foster of the Pacific
system was interviewed yesterday. He
said that he had heard of the collision
near Port Costa but that he would not
receive until to-day a full account of the
accident. â¢ Engineer Prouty had not as yet
made his report, and so the real cause of
the accident could not be known. .
The . Southern . Pacific Company is ; at
present using a new: block system, and
old railroad men claim that it is not per
fect, in fact that it is valueless to prevent
collisions. Semaphores have been placed
all along the lines of the Southern Pacific
Companf, ,yet through carelessness or
misunderstandings several collisions have
occurred. â¢ > ' . -.
A rear end , collision .occurred, yesterday
morning ..between . a locomotive and .a
freight train on â¢ the line , of the" Southern
Pacific | Company between Crockett . and
'Port Costa. t.The'engine- was' badly|dam
aged and the' caboose j of theV freight
train was broken up into small kindling
wood. Engineer J. Prouty sustained seri
ous ; injuries irom jumping -from, the "loco
motive. . HeT was\ the only one hurt. He
was brought to this city :> soon : after tha
"accident and tak,en to the Railroad Hos
pital. â¢ :'-.â¢â¢: Â¦-....â¢"Â¦ -. â¢ " :: . .- . Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦ .
The railroad officials are very reticent
about the - cause of the accident and to
all questions reply that until an investi
gation, has been .made "the cause cannot
be ascertained. I r Â»- Â¦ - - . Â¦Â¦"..
Those who saw the wreck say that the
freight, train was not moving and that
the engine suddenly ,- appearect around a
curve and dashed right into the caboose.
Fortunately the ' caboose was > unoccupied
at the time, the conductor and brakemen
being in the front part of the train.
Engineer - Prouty and his firemen owe
their, lives to their jumping from the loco
motive before the collision. /
TVilmore, prior to being sent ,to Alca
traz, served in the Philippines and was
known as a desperate fellow. "While play
ing "monte" with., several fellow soldiers,
he became Incensed at some remark pass
ed by one of them,, and drawing a re
volver, opened fire on them. As the re
sult two of them were instantly killed and
two others seriously wounded. â¢ Wilmore
was arrested after gt* desperate struggle
and subsequently tried by court-martial.
On account of his record as a fighter dur?
ing the frequent skirmishes with the Fil
ipinos, the court sentenced him to life im
prisonment. at Alcatraz. .
After being transported to the island
Wilmore, on account of his Impoverished
system, due to long service in the Philip
pines, was given an "outside" Job.
A short time ago while the guards were
busy searching for a missing convict, Wil
more, who was waiting for Just such a
chance, crawled down the side of the Isl
and, and, tearing away the flight of stairs
which was generally used by visitors to
the military prison, was soon afloat on the
bay. -The stairs were subsequently found
at the Clay-stret wharf. '
As he had a few dollars with him, Wil
more procured a suit of clothes on the
city front and, discarding his uniform;
started uptown to see his old friends who
had done duty with him in the Philip
pines.
The military authorities, after learning
of his escape, notified Captain Seymour,
who detailed Detectives Crockett and
Hammill to arrest Wilmore. Since then
thÂ« detectives have been making a thor
ough search for the escaped convict, but
without getting a trace of him. One of
his friends has Informed the police that
Wilmore's escape was accomplished by
a woman to whom he was engaged to be
married before he joined the forces in the
Philippines. It is said that she was in a
boat contiguous to the Island when Wil
more escaped and had the stairs on which
he was floating towed to this city. Her
name Is known to thft police, and if the
story Is found to be true it is the inten
tion of the military authorities to charge
her with being an accessory. It seems as
if it would have been easier to take Wil
more Into the boat it is said was used in
towing, but it may have been desired by
his rescuers, if he had any, to bring the
Etalrs over to avert suspicion as to ac
complices. Â« .
The military authorities in conjunction
with the police are making a vigorous
search for Tom "Wilmore.-a colored/ mili
tary convict, who escaped from Alcatraz
In a sensational manner a short time ago.

DIES IN A TENT
FROM STARVATION
Body of a Man Is Found
in the Willows at
1 Mud Lake.
Papers Lead to the Belief That
His Name Was Chester
Billings.
The Morgue officials were notified yes
terday morning that the body of a man
had been discovered on Saturday after
noon at Mud LjLke, among the sand
dunes, west of Ocean View, by a boy
named Harry Sherman. The finding: of
the' remains was reported by Sherman lo
Lieutenant Anderson at the Seventeenth
street police station that evening. Deputy
Coroner Brown and Fred Donohue, the
janitor, drove out yesterday to the scene.
The body was stark naked and death
had occurred about two weeks ago. The
man had strung pieces of canvas between
two willow trees to protect him from the
rain and there he had lived, two miles
from any house. There were>no cooking
utensils in the Improvised ttent, and "how
the man had subsisted was a mystery. A
suit of old clothes was found at the place
and a 'small box containing a lot of
papers, letters and newspaper clippings.
The officials had to carry the body for
nearly two miles to the wagon. Deputy
Brown thinks the man died from starva
tion.
From appearances the deceased was
about 40 years of age. Among the papers
were envelopes addressed to "Mr. Ches
ter Billings, San Jose, Cal.," by his
nephew, whose name was also Chester
Billings, and who lived at Trenton, Cal.'
These envelopes were postmarked > in
1883. A long letter written by deceased to
his nephew was found. He had evidently,
owned a vineyard in Horland, Colo., at
one time, as there was a bill to "Dr. M.
H. Ms-the" for $200 for grapes supplied.
The T"*iri -was of a literary turn of mind,
aa numerous compositions on different
subjects written In pencil on pieces of
wrapping paper and other scraps were
found In the box. Among the documents
Â¦was also an examination paper from, the
fourth to the fifth, grade in one of the
public schools here dated in 1873 and
signed ''Carrie Barlow, teacher."
Asphyxiated by Gas.
Theodore Vujovich, about 29 years of
ape. was found dead In bed In his room,
E29 Bryant street, yesterday morning.
The room door had not been locked and
the gas was escaping from the burner.
It Is supposed that death was accidental,
as there was nothing to lead to the be
lief that he could have committed sui
cide. He had a^fourth interest in a res
taurant at 10 Sacramento street and sold
it to E. J. GudeUi on January 13 for $500.
He lived with GudelJL In the pockets of
his clothing Chief Deputy Coroner Mc-
Connick found $250. Vujovich was a na
tive of Austria and returned from a trip
to his old home a few weeks ago. The
body was taken to the Morgue.
? Dead in Boom for Two Days.
Frank Otto, an old goldier, who lived
at 515% Bush street, was found .dead in
bed yesterday. He had not been seen for
two days, and it is supposed he died last
Friday. He was over 60 years of age,
and death is supposed to have resulted
from natural causes. The body was re
moved to the Morgue.
