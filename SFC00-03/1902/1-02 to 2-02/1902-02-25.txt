transportation. He expressed a desire to
ride on an engine at some time during the
iourney through the country and It was
arranged that he should do so at the out
set of his western tour later in the week.
The start was made so late , that there
were no crowds anywhere. In Maryland
during the early hours of Â¦ the morning
some crowds gathered at the stations, -but
no stops were made.
The Prince's stay in Baltimore was ne
cessarily very brief. . The train arrived at
it and was met at the Union station by the
Mayor and an escort of twenty-four prom
inent citizens. Two hundred members of
the various German singing societies were
also admitted to the station, but none of
the big crowd which congregated in the
streets was allowed to approach the spe
cial train. Prince Henry came out of his
apartment In the rear of the long train
and Mayor Hayes was presented to him.
As he stood upon the rear platform beside
Mr. von Liqgen, the German Consul at
this point, the Mayor made a warm speech
01 welcome and presented an engrossed
copy of the resolutions of welcome which
have been adopted. by the City Council.
The Prince in accepting this thanked him
ana the people for their courtesy., *
The chorus of singers then rendered sev
eral German patriotic songs and after a
stay of twenty minutes the train pulled
out amid the cheers of the crowds which
lined both, sides of- the tracks. *sfSrÂ«fi1*
BALTIMORE, Feb. 24.â The train which

there was no desire to make time with It.
The train left Jersey City at 1 o'clock and
It was arranged to so time its run that it
would not reach Washington until -a.f ter
10 o'clock. The Prince retired shortly after
the special began Its journey across the
State of New Jersey and it was 7 o'clock
when he arose. He breakfasted at 8
o'clock in his private car. He* said he
found himself very well and thanked the

islands. The climax- came when Bishop
Willis came up from the, islands to at
tend the Episcopal, convention that was
held in this city . last â¢ October. . He was
sent out from England ; and ordained by
the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1872 as
the Bishop of Hawaii. At that time It
was looked down upon [ as a mere mis
sionary venture, but it has grown to i
diocese of -. vast importance.', Americans
gradually populated ' the. islands. When
Bishop Willis arrived in this* city last
October to appear before the Episcopal
convention he felt that his fight was lost
and that the popular feeling was that he
should resign and that the rich church
property that is. now- 'worth nearly
$1,000,000 should - be . transferred . to
the .'Episcopal' cfhurch of this country.
â¢With a broken voice he said - to a \ re
porter of .The Call who interviewed- him:
"I will^ay my case before the. conven
tion. Should they desire to take the pres
ent church under their Jurisdiction, I will
bow to the inevitable. Tmu^t admit that
there are many in , Honolulu in favor of

WASHINGTON, Feb." 24.â Prince Henry
prepared to make calls upon " the foreign
Embassadors stationed In Washington' as
the high rank of an Embassador makes
him **a personal representative 'of his
sovereign or ruler and entitles him to the
first call. The Prince was accompanied
by the German Embassador, the two
driving in an open landau. S As the Prince
came into view the crowd gave him an
ovation of cheers. At the head of the car
riage galloped the escort of cavalry troop~
ers. - The drive took the party throughout
the northwest section of â¢ the city, where
crowds lined the streets. â¢ â¢
The Prince's first call was at the British
embassy. Lord Pauncefote being the dean
of the diplomatic corps; ,
The Prince did not enter the embassy,
simply leaving hia card. Calls were then
made on the French, Russian, Italian and
the Mexican Erobassadors, at each place
cards being left.- The Prince's calls did
not- extend to) the foreign Ministers, -as
their rank does not- make them personal
representatives of their, sovereign or ruler.
Returning, to . the German" embassy
Prince Henry and his party took lunch
with, the German Embassador. and the.
members of his staff.- -

stretches out. The great republic is
launched in the very midst of the inter

from frost, and tne relatively low lands
are subject to it. The distinctive crop
of San Bernardino Valley is citrus fruits.
Oranges predominate, tollowed next uy
lemons, and of late years the grape fruit
lias become a popular product. Olives,
almonds, prunes, apricots, peaches, pears
and wine, raisin and table grapes are all
grown to perfection in this district. In
the eleven years prior to 189S, Riverside
shipped nearly seve"n million boxes of
' oranges, an average annual income of

Water is the life-blood of the land.
Without it this valley would become a
Femi-desert; . The rain cWuds irom the
Pacific- Ocean are condensed against . the
i j to ll.Ouu-foot elevations of the Sierra
"Madre and Ban Bernaramo Mountains, in
the winter time usually in tne form of
tnow, which feeds the streams up to
about May. Lippincott classine3 the water
eupply as surrace streams, underground
Â¦water and storage reservoir water. The
Santa and other mountain streams
have brought down detritus and built up
celtas in the valley. The winter floods
gradually disappear In ilowing over these
deltas, and, kinking down, form reser
voirs of artesian water of unknown but
great capacity. In addition to the winter
Hoods, the summer now of all the streams
from San Antonio CreÂ«k to Mill Creek
is diverted and used for irrigation pur
poses, and probably ao per cent of it sinks
into the ground and reinforces the water
piane. Inis large undergrouna reservoir
slopes toward Santa Ana River, the most
important stream of Southern California
west or . the Coast Range. It drains a
total area above Rincon of 1657 square
miles; 971 square miles of the. basin are
mountainous. The controlling outlet of
this great underground reservoir is at
Rincon. where there is a larger body of
water flowing during the summer than at
any other place in California south of
the Tehachapl Mountains, except along
v the Colorado. >
if an area of gravel Â«f 500 square miles
should be charged, to a, depth of 300 feet
â a fair average depth to assume for this
valleyâ its storage capacity Â«Â¦ would be
22.000,000 acre-feet of water. These fig
ures suggest the enormous capacity of
this great underground storage reservoir
of San Bernardino Valley. It has been
charged with waters through a long cycle
of years by the floods described. Honce
me?.surements made in the summer of
1838 showed that there was almost three
times more water rising In the central
portion of the valley than' there, was
entering the valley from the mountain
drainage barin.
Lippincott holds, therefore, that prop
erly located development works near Rin
con, permitting the lowering of this wa
ter plane each season twenty-one " feet
over an area of 1000 acres should yield
from 1500 to 2009 miners* inches of ; water.
He thinks the proper method of proced
ure should be to divert, for the creation
tit pumping power, the entire flow of the
Santa Ana River, near the , Auburndale
bridge, about the 1st of May. and to re
turn the water to its natural bed at the
oloBe of the irrigation season. His con
clusions are: That a large percentage 'of
irrigation water returns to the channels
cf the streams; that the movement" of the
water through the soil being- excee'dlngrly
Flow, " this return water from irrigation
will be a. permanent source of supply;
that water of this character is now mak
ing its appearance in the lands near Rin
con"; that it is Impossible, to determine
the amount of water that could be gath

As passed the measure provides that ar

required to pay the duties levied against
them by the Philippine commission and
paid upon like articles imported into the

ported free into the United States shall
be hereafter exempt from import duty,
imposed in the Philippines. "
The bill exempts the commerce passing
between the United States and the Phil

1, 1904, and authorizes the Philippine com
mission to issue licenses. to craft now en

SAN JOSE, Feb. 24.â The objections of
the Pastors' Union to the laying of the
cornerstone of the Carnegie library came
up again to-night in the Council in the
shape of a resolution presented by Coun
cilman MacAulay, which scored Ke\ . Â«
C. Meredith of the South Methodist
Church and plainly told the pastors to
attend to their own affairs. . Â¦
The pastors objected to the cornerstone
being laid on â¢ Sunday and because the
stone bore the inscription, "Placed by
San Jose Lodge. No. 522, B. P. O. E., at
the request of the Mayor and Common
The 0 resolution adopted by the Council
to-night states that Rev. H. C. Meredith,
in a purported interview, scathingly, criti
cized the conduct of the Elks on the oc
casion of the laying of the cornerstone.
Continuing, it Is asserted that the Coun
cil cannot "allow such insults and
truths to go to our local lodge of Elks
and the outside world without recording
a vigorousUbjectlon." The resolution de
clares that the ceremonies of the Elks
are fully approved and ratified, and that
"the action of the Pastors' Union In med
dling and interfering with matters which
do not in any degree concern it, whereby
a senseless agitation was started, tending
to create a feeling of unrest, must of
necessity be discouraged."
It is further Stated that, as the reported
remarks of Rev. H. C. Meredith are an
insult to the Elks' Lodge, â¢ which com
prises many of San Jose's prominent citi
zens and as the cornerstone was laid at
the request of the Council, "we cannot
too strongly denounce such purported re
marks by Rev. H. C. Meredith as- pre
sumptuous,- ungentlemanly and unchris
tianlike."
The Council ordered the cornerstone,
which had been removed by the contrac
tor because It was granite Instead of
sandstone, replaced.
Delaney and Â¦ Campbell recently had
trouble. Both had been drinking before
the tragedy occurred. Campbell declares
be shot after he was stabbed. "
While the men were engaged for a few
seconds In combat, Campbell received one
knife wound in the side, but it is not of
a 6erious nature, as the blade struck a
rib and inflicted only a superficial cut.
Whether the stabbing was done by De
laney befÂ©rt; Campbell drew his revolver,
after the revolver was drawn and before
the shots were fired or after the shots.
Is a question. Knowing the desperate
character of both men, all of the by-
Btanders were excited and were chiefly
concerned in getting out of the way..
Delaney lingered in a half conscious
ctate until j-esterday afternoon, when he
died. He is survived by a widow and
three children. ' >
Campbell put up his revolver and went
to the home of a friend to await the com
ing of "officers from Red Bluff. .
Delaney staggered back to the wall of
the builaing. saying "I guess I'm hurt."
He sank to the: floor.
There .was a vaudeville performance
and dance in Vmaon Saturday night, the
dance following the entertainment. It
was during the intermission between the
two that tne trouble occurred. Constable
Uelaney was sitting in the hall when
some one from without-threw a bunch of
firecrackers into the doorway "and they
exploded. Delaney immediately went out
and attempted to place. James. Campbell
under arrest,- believing him ' to have
thrown the lirecrackers. - . , -
As â¢ Delaney approached, Campbell
hacked off the sidewalk and as far as the
pole to which horses are tied., Here it
was that the men came" together, and: a
moment later Campbell was seen-io press
Delaney back witn .his left hand, while
with his right . he ; aimed a revolver at
Delaney's abdomen and In rapid succes
sion fired. three times.
REDDUCG, Feb. 24!â Constable VL De
laney died yesterday in Vina from the
effects of bullet wounds received on Sat-'
urday night at a public entertainment in
that place. James Campbell, ; who " fired
the fatal shots, is in the Tehama County
Jail, charged with murder. Though there
were several witnesses to the affray, Ho '
two tell the same story. So different are
their accounts of the tragedy that it is
difficult to form an opinion regarding

Newhall Suggests Plan. ;.
The representatives of the Sacramento
Valley Development Association came to
the city with no definite plan, except to
ask San Francisco to assist In making
their counties better known. A modest
suggestion was made by one of the dele
gates that the Chamber, of Commerce
might assist financially to the extent of
$1000. as a starter. Some speech-making
took place on this Idea. Mr. McCormlck
of the passenger department of the South
ern Pacific Company vlg-orously advocated
doing something vastly â¢ more Â¦ effective
than this. He said that the Â¦ Southern Pa
ciflc Company's experience established the
fact that 11000 would be of no account in
bringing about the desired result. He also
made the statement that in the last year
the Southern Pacific Company had ex
pended 5100,000 In magazine advertising of
California and $400,000 In Eastern news
papers In attracting attention to this
State.
What can be accomplished In this way
may be foreseen by bearing in mind how
the enterprising people of. Southern Cali
fornia attracted permanent prosperity to
their part of the State, and also iSy esti
mating the Imperial domain of the north
ern and central counties, which now bid
fair to hustle on their own account in the
vigorous fashion that has made Southern
California known all over the world. ;.
a permanent association to advertise
systematically: the- resources of the Cali
fornia counties north of Tehachapi,' to the
end that settlers may be attracted and
general prosperity result.- This decision
was reached last evening at the end of an
entire day of counseling and discussion
between a delegation from the Sacra
mento Valley Development Association
and the trustees of the Chamber of Com
merce. The plan was suggested by Presi
dent George A. NewhMl of the Chamber
of Commerce and it met with prompt in

Mr. McCormick advised that parties pro
vided with -literature descriptive of the
counties north of Tehachapi should travel
on trains and should meet incomers from
the East at Ogden- and in Los Angeles.
It - appearing that the Sacramento Vallev
counties ,. have in preparation â¢ a â¢ costly
pamphlet ;Mr. McCormick recommended
that/such literature be at once dis
tributed , but that care should be Â¦ taken
that it should reach the right parties.
He also ! suggested .that advertising of

cally. . i r'

iMr. McCormick made several interest
ing suggestions. He said that the valley
counties of Northern and Central Califor
nia were in need â¢ of good hotels. The
Southern Pacific I Company could not ad
vertise Northern., California , and Central
California as resorts, for there were po
accommodations 'in the interior for tour

son voted with the Democrats. 1
Turner then sought: to. secure.;reeo'gn!
tXr^s in order to have spread on the rec
ords a protest of Tillman.-but-the-privi
lege was denied at the time.and\the Sen
ate proceeded to the consideration of
amendments to the Philippine, bill.
The first of the amendments taken up'
was that offered by Teller, declaring that
the constitution and all laws of the
United States which are not locally ap
plicable shall have the same force ; in the
Philippine archipelago as elsewhere in
the United States.
The amendment : was voted down 26
to 47.
Senator Hoar then offered an amend-"
ment providing that no person shall be
convicted of treason in the Philippines bv
any tribunal, civil or military, excep't
upon the testimony of two witnesses or
of confession In open court. -Senator
Lodge volunteered to accept this amend
ment, but Hoar insisted upon a rollcall
and the amendment was agreed to'unani
mously, the vote being 69 to 0. â¢ Hoar of
fered another amendment providing that
there should be no punishment by any
tribunal of the United States, civil or
military, of any person who should fail
to give information of the treason. of a
mother, father, Â« son or daughter. The
amendment was agreed toâ 38 to 34.
Foraker offered an amendment provid
ing that the rate of duties -upon articles
coming into the United States from the
Philippine Islands should be 50 per cent
of. the Dingley rates, instead of 75 , per
cent. It was rejectedâ 29 to 43.
5 Vest offered an amendment.- a. declara
tion that -the bill should -not mean -that
the Philippines ever should be Incorpo
rated into citizenship of the United States,
or permanently to. be held as an integral
part of this country. The amendment was
rejectedâ 24 to 43.
The. bill -was then passed â 16 to 2S. Â«
Â¦The Senate at 6:50 went intp executive
session, and at 6:55 adjourned. .
At this -point' the guest of the nation.
Prince H^nry of Prussia, was -escorted,
into the chamber to a seat by the side
At President (pro tem.) Frye. As the
Prince .ascended to the President's plat
form the Senate rose in a body and
hearty applause swept over the floor and
the thronged galleries.
Bailey expressed the opinion that Sen
ators could not be prevented from exer
cising their right to Â¦ vote even though
they were under arrest. While Bailey
was speaking Prince Henry, who had oc
cupied his seat beside Senator Frye. for
twenty minutes, withdrew from. . the
Chamber, accompanied by his escort,
amid applause fr.om both the^ floor and
the galleries.
t Finally the chair recognized Aldrich,
and he- made the point that as the Senate
was proceeding under a unanimous,
agreement to- vote on the Philippine bill
no discussion was in order on any other
subject. He asked that this point be sub
mitted to. the Senate, which was done,
with the result that the discussion : was
declared out of order by a vote â¢ of . 45 to
25. On this question Wellington voted
with the Republicans to sustain the point
of order, while Jones of Nevada and Ma-
Prince Henry Arrives.
Frye, in the chair, however, said that
the matter of keeping to that agreement
remained with the Senators, and also that
he "would not refuse to recognize a Sena
tor who rose to a question oÂ£ his personal
privilege.
-Turner Insisted that the fact that a
Senator had been declared to be in con
tempt did not 'deprive him of the right of
voting. Such a contention, he maintained,
would be a. monstrous proposition.
Foraker and Mallory spoke upon the
question at issue. .
insisting on discussing the question of
the rights of the South Carolina Sena
tors to vote, despite the points of order
that under unanimous agreement debate
was not in order on any subject..
Hanna said that with the personal dif
ferences of the two Senators from'Mary
land ; he had nothing to 'do, but when
statements were ; made involving the
action.of. a; President whose lips now
were closed in death, he felt if was time
for him to sneak.",
"The Â¦ statement made,"> said he, "that
a promise was given i by ; our ' dead j Presi
dent with respect to the disposition of the
Philippine Islandsâ a promise that was
rot kept â I i resent that statement in the
name of .the American people." (Ap

He was willing to. admit that thsre
might have been a misunderstanding, but
if any refutation . of 'the charge were
needed . the : character of "President Mc-
Kinley ought to afford a sufficient refuta
tion of it. , It was mot possible to enter
taJn such - a' charge and ; In â¢ the name of

test against it. :: â¢' " ,_ : ', "
The debate was closed by Fairbanks
with an eloquent â¢ speech in Â¦ support of
thevpending measure. Four o'clock hav
ing arrived; ; Lodge offered the amend
ments of- which' he had give^i notice an
hour: before,": and both were adopted.
'Â¦The amendments were: "', To provide for

General Appraisers, and. to fix July 1, 1904,
as the time when the navigation laws, of

Then' followed a long wrangle, : Turner
Resented by Hanna.
He' explained that while McComas ac
companied him in his call upon the late
President, he "was not within hearing of
all â¢ the conversation and did , not know
what had been said. He asserted that
the President (McKinley) did make the
promises to him which he had stated pre
viously he had made. - '.'..â¢'
."I believe," said- he, "that the President
meant at that time to carry' out those
promises, but because of sinister and ma
lign influences he was forced to. abandon
them, and to drift. â¢
"I do not stand alone In this matter,
and 'my colleague in so assailing- my
voracity assails Â¦ that of another Senator.
The same promises, were made to him as
were made to me. He is on the floor
now," declared Wellington, pounding his
desk emphatically; "or was a few min
utes ago. I, was not mistaken." ;.
-After referring to a visit to President
McKinley by General Agnus' of Baltimore,
and himself, Wellington, -speaking with
deliberation and emphasis, said:
"I desire to be within the rules of the
Senate. I. will say this. If my colleague
at any time will reiterate outside of this
chamber Â¦what he has said ! in ' this cham
ber, then; I will tell him that he is not
correct, and tell him what I. will not say
in this chamber because of ! Senatorial
dignity,- because of parliamentary rulesâ
i hat he utters a cowardly and malicious
falsehood." ~
Senator Frye, the president pro. tem.,
ordered Wellington to take his seat. ,
The Maryland Senator complied.
Hoar made the point or order that Wel
lington was: out of order in using the
language he had- used.!. -
- Frye sustained the point of order and
the Incident â¢ seemed to close at that
point. â¢ : - Â¦ . t
Allison and Clay - spoke on the pending
bill.
"He Is," said Wellington, "so ignorant
upon this question" that he nought not to
speak upon it, or his statements were un
true."
Wellington, evidently laboring under
some excitement, replied to some' state
ments made during to-day's debate by his
colleague, McComas. Those statements, he
said, had cast doubt upon his (Welling
ton's) truth and veracity, but he insisted
that McComas' recollection did notjserve
him well." Â¦ '
Wellington Gets Excited.
McComas of Maryland said hia col
league (Wellington) had said that' he
(Wellington) -had been given assurances
by President McKinley that the United
States did not propose to hold the Philip
pines as colonies. He referred to Welling
ton's desertion from the Republican par
ty, but was interrupted by Wellington.
"I object," said the latter,-, "to my col
league's words ' concerning my desertion
from the Republican. party.'/ '
McComas said . he accepted the"objec
tion and continued. ' He said he had been
present' at. the conference .' between the
President and Wellington, and he denied
emphatically that the President's prom
ise had not been kept. It was absurd in
his colleague, he asserted, for him to
make such a charge. 8
Senator Berry said the Philippine
trouble had cost $500,000,000, 5000 American
lives,. and. millions of property burned and
otherwise destroyed.
Hoar said that he intended to vote for
the measure, unless something was pre
sented that did not seem "to be there. :
-Foraker. spoke in favfarof the bill.-.
Turner of Washington" resented Spoon
er's criticisms upon the Democratic party
for what he said were the strictures upon
the army of the United States. He be
lieved that it was unjust to the dead and
cowardly to the living to inject the late
President McKinley's name into the de
bate.
The Philippine tariff bill was then taken
up, speeches being limited. to fifteen min
utes each. â .. - , ,

HONOLULU, Feb. " 17.â The Oceanic
steamship Sierra and the Canadian-Aus
tralian liner Moana both arrived to-day,
the former from San 'Francisco and the
latter from Victoria, after terrible experi
ences with a storm of which Hawaii has
felt the effects slightly. The Sierra was
twenty-four hours late and the Moano
two days. During "a large part of the
trip both vessels were under slow speed,
and the Sierra had to practically lie to
at one time. Captain Carey of the
Moano reports a hurricane on the 10th
and again on the 12th, and part of his deck
cargo was washed way. The seas broke '
in the doors of the officers' cabins. At :
midnight on the 12th the storm was ac
companied by vivid and continuous light
ning, with heavy thunder arid rain. Cap
tain Houdlette of the Sierra reports the
worst storm he has ever seen in over
200 trips between Honolulu and San Fran
cisco. The seas broke over the, bridge of
the big steamer, her port rail was car
ried way and some of the signal ma
chinery high up on the bridge was dam
aged.
At Honolulu a light southerly gale has
been blowing for several days, with
heavy surf, causing the small interisland
vessels to make for shelter. The steamer"
J. A. Cummins. Â¦ one of the smaller ones
of the local fleet, narrowly escaped found
ering between Waimanalo. this island,
and Honolulu. She struck bottom in pass
ing out of Waimanalo and the sharp coral
caused a leak which was all the combined
efforts of her crew could handle. A race
for Honolulu was made and the vessel '
reached port in time, a fire engine being
6ent for to pump her out and . prevent
her finking at the wharf.
For several days the weather conditions
here have been somewhat unusual. Yes
terday was the coldest day recorded here,
the thermometer registering as low as 52
degrees in the morning and showing the
greatest fluctuation ever known here, for
it rose C4 degrees during- the day. There
are indications to-day of another storm
from the south. : N, , Â¦>,

FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER-H. 8.
&., City. The Frankenstein monster Is
described in a romance. by Mrs. Shelley,
1817, and is the hero of the tale which
created the monster. The story Is that of a
young medical student who created a
monstrous being out of the fragments of
bodies picked from .churchyards and dis
secting rooms and it assumed human
form, but was without a soul. The mon
ster had muscular strength, passions and
active life," but* had" no breath of divinity.
It " Icnged for animal . love . and Â»T|lmnl
sympathy, but was shunned by all. It
was moot powerful for evil, and being
fully conscious of Its own defects and de
formitjes sought with persistence .to In
flict retribution'; on * the student that
called It into existence. It. murdered a
friend of the student; strangled hla bridÂ«
and finally came to an end In th* norths
ern seas.

In London things are practically as bad
as' in 'France,, and 'Â¦even.-, the"; best, private
houses do not know, the luxury of an ice
chest ' â¢
The luxury of ice, icecream andVf rozen
delicacies in. France during, summer is
practically unknown, and the few Ameri
can manufacturers, trying: to foster a
trade even in the larger cities there, have
first of all to educate the people' up to the
idea of using ice. The American Consul
at Rouen relates his experiences for the
guidance of Americans who would invade
France with the machinery of refrigera-'
tlon: . .: -: .* I'r^'-'- Â¦
"A few evenings ago. I stopped at one
of the largest cafes here and asked for
icecream. It was served in a little glass
about' the size of a wine glass. There was
certainly not more than three leveltable
spoonf uls, : and of a poor, quality, at that.
The cost was 20 cents. There are only two
or three places in this city where cream
is served. In order to make such a busi
ness pay; a great deal of patience would
have to' be exercised. In Normandy new
Ideas filter In the people's minds very
slowly, and the person .who opened an ice
cream saloon would, in the beginning,' be
regarded with suspicion. Then there is a
deep-seated prejudice against cool things
and physicians generally .'say that Ice is
most injurious to the health."
There is. however, a : J)ig, 'opening for
American* enterprise in this direction. â¢ â¢

the more-sure by the fact that the rains have come
at the timeswhen they will do. most good. At hardly .
any season are showers ; more " propitious to our.

fall in February. Unless the' spring should by some,
unfamiliar freak be a season of drought, we may look

everything from the hay fields to olive groves will
yield- abundantly and repay the worker for the toil
and the skill he has put upon his fields. ,

grand army of office-holders. According
to a count recently made by the St. Louis

appears that Jones made his visit not on behalf of
Bryan, but- on his own. account. He is no longer in

successfully that it was defeated. The Governor has",

the Senator has put forward a contestant for. the
Governorship/' Hence'- the Jones influence in politics

not count a run of five because there are
two threes and one of these threes is an

there is another run of three, namely

Questions of- the relative .numbers of marriages:
and of .births in proportion to population, which now
occupy so much of the attention of . sociologists,
were carefully studied in comp'iling the census. ' ..It
appears*. that . of . the total numbcr'of males' 1,292,594
are unmarried, 777,3^3 are married and 72,128 are
widowed. Of the females 1,403,842 are unmarried,
793,097. are married, arid I97,5i7_are widowed. An
interesting .note to one of the tables says: "The
proportion of the married to the population at all
ages is now higher than it was in 1891, owing to the
decrease in the. proportion. ''of children through the
decline in the birth rate. The proportion of the mar-;
riedy however, if calculated on the population aged
upward. of twenty years, is distinctly lower than it
was ten years ago, both among males. and females."
>*-^ ENSUS figures relating to.; London collected
I .; :. ..â¢ : last year have just been . compiled and pub
: >- - r : lished officially. Â¦'â¢ Among them are many in-
teresting facjs,' one; of the more notable of >^hich is
the "revelation that cheap and ready means of urban
transportation have had thei effect of building. up the
suburbs of the huge; metropolis? much more rapidly ,
than Â«the city '"Â¦ itself.- Thus while the population of.
London, the administrative' county, was found to be;
lasjt'a'ear^S^s^i; showing an. increase of something
overJ7.per,cent since the previous census, the popula- '
jtion of, what might be called "Greater : London"
amounted, to 6,581,372,^showing an increase, of 947,
000. during "the decade.'. Within the six central bor
oughs, of the city-there* was- an. actual decrease of.
67,000 in the population. . . : =? " ..-â¢'Â¦
: -< That -much r of , the 'showing of 'the ' census is of
course highly gratifying, since it' attests/the' increas- .
ing comfort of thej.0eople and the lessening tendency
toward overcrowding, which at one time, threatened
to^be a ; serious j evil;;;- Statistics 'relating, to labor show
that the percentage of the total population abo^ the
age of ten years engaged in. gainful occupations was
83.6 for males and 37.4 for women. Among women
there was. an increase of 181 per cent in' the number
employed as clePks, 77.6 per. cent" in the. civil service,;,
while those engaged ; in domestic service increased
only 1.7 per cent. 'Â¦'Â¦ "Â¦"- ;-..Â¦ ' Â¦': ' : Â¦Â¦ Â¦'. -.-. ';Â¦" '.- Â¦*"'â¢' â¢_
The variations in the percentages of difle/ent lines
of employment among men are 'even, more interest
ing than those among women. The . \Vestminster
Gazette .says: "Actors, for instance^; appear to have
increased amazingly in number: during, the last ten
years. In 1891, there were 1271; in 1001, 2234- â or an
increase of over 75 per.:. 'cent/V Author^,; -editors,
journalists,' reporters. and shorthand writers' appear
also to have extended their ranks considerably, the
figures showing an^, advance from-,.27o.2 to 3466.
Schoolmasters and teachers have gone up from, 6727
to 7359. Civil servants have also',, multiplied abund-.
antly, since there are now 15,684 â¢' of them against
u,537 a decade since. . Commercial, clerks have risen
from 71.387. to 84,317. But the biggest; increase of all
relates to those connected with /the electrical indus
try, whq have swollen in numbers- 'frorij' '4801; to
12,788â a grpwth of more than 166 per cent. Those
engaged in the explosives and matches trade .come
next in this respectâ 929 to 2305, or "a gain, of 148 per
cent. On the othef hand^river-andrcanal workers
have fallen off. 20 per cent, bookbinders 4 per cent;
silkworkers 50 per cent, and boot atid shoe makers
and, dealers 13 per cent." . ' \/ , ...-.Â¦ . . .
'^Although London .has. long been the metropolis
01 the; world, it is far from being a cosmopolitan city
in respect to its. population. .Morcthan 3,000,000 of
its people -were born in the city itself, and the great
majority of the remaining population " were born
either within the kingdom or in British colonies.
Persons of foreign birth numbered only 161,222, and
of- these 20,224 were British subjects, 1 ' 5.621 were nat-,
uralized British subjects, and 135,377 were. foreigners;
an increase in the case of the last-named of 40,324
since 1891.' Of; the 135,377 foreigners 79,804 are males
and 55.573 females. Natives of Russia'are the most

forms of two great, modern Governments, Great.
Britain and Germany. A commission goes to the
coronation of King Edward VII, and we are officially
entertaining the nephew of the King, who represents
his e^der brother, the Kaiser.
It has been a long time between /coronations in
Great' Britain. Victoria.was crowned in 1837/ during
the Presidency' of 'Martin Van Buren, s who was^a very:
democratic Democrat. But he was represented;^ the
coronation of the young Queen by his son John'; who
danced with Victpria, and, it was said, kissed "her,
and roused, in her heart certain tender feelings -that,
are common to all, to Princesses and to, peasants;
alike. John Van Buren was a handsome yourig'man, :
of fine manners and great ability. At that \ distant - !
coronation he was: paid all the honors -of a Prince,
and all his life was hailed by that title.. No-matter*
what may have been said at the time,- his presence at.
the great ceremony as the representative of his father,
the President, and of the American people, did not
undermine our institutions, and. was ho indication of.
the decay of their republican vigor. ;But it was "so

I believe tlrroly in the American nubile
school and in the American principles which
are taught in them, and during my adminis
tration, so far as my Influence may po I will
support and encourage with my whole heart
and my whole soul the common school system
of our city Â»nd our State. â¢ ' . Â¦"
Shirks No Difficulty.
I nhrink from no responsibility; shirk nÂ»
difficulty. I^will try to live up to every prom
ise and pledge! have ever made and by the
principles and ideas I express here to-day.
I am not. a professional reformer. I am
an honest man, honestly attempting to
do what he conceives his honest duty. I pro
pose, as far as my ability will permit, to gtvÂ«
the people a fair, just, clean and honest ad
ministrationâpractical, economical and- busi
nesslike. I favor clean politics. I propose to
see ttat the laws are enforced. I am In favor
of & â¢liberal, broad-gauged policy in the conduct
of municirÂ»al affairs and. in the treatment of
our fellow-dtlzens. I do not believe that be
cause my ideas may not be In exact accord with
others I should forcibly impose my opinions
upon them. â¢ Â»
I favor liberty of personal action within thÂ»'
limits or the laws of the land and of a *ounl
?Â£m? P ollcy -, f I be " e \. e ln PrwxrvJnr the Â«ub
fftactlal morality of the masaes. I believe in
the rights of the individual man and in fol
terin? his interests.
The phases of his public duties are numerous
ajid divers*. He must be a man of many
sides, but all turning to a. common "end and
result. Whatever his. personal sympathies may
be. in whatever direction his own personal
preferences may lie. he must, so far as he Js
able, represent in his official life all of his
fellow-cltliena without reference to class, so
cial or financial standine. 'relWrfous or politi
cal belief. He must be a practical man of the
world â not a visionary dreamer. He must con
front conditions; he cannot work entirely on
self-conceived theories. The city is alreaay
built and developed. He. can Influence it,
but he cannot rebuild It. He must take things
as they are. He may better them, but. ha can
not always reverse them.
He is at the head of municipal officialdom.
Under his supervision are thousands of muni
cipal employss, for all of whom in the public
eye ho stands to some extent responsible.
With the appointment of very few of them
is he in anywise directly concerned. He la
also by law charged with the added duty of
supervising; every* bureau and .department of
the city government and of â¢ seeing that the
laws are DroDerly enforced and carried out.
The task imposed ur>on him Is a herculean
one. To be "effective, to be influential, the
Mayor must be a strong man; to be of advan
tage to the city's interests he must' be a prac
tical msn; to be Just he must be a sympathetic
man; above all things he must be an honest
man and a fearless one.
Public Duties Nuinerous.
In a v.ord, he ie the chief executive of a large
and lmeortant metropolis and of a vast and
heterogeneous cosmopolitan city. Legally and
officially he must represent all â all classes.. all
interests, all elements. With the requirements.
or the law he must treat all with equal fair
ness and consfderatlon and with exact Justice.-

day and handed down an important opin
ion dismissing the appeal in tho deporta
tion case of Fong Mey Tuk, a Chinese
woman of the coolie class, who was found
in this city without the registration cer
tificate required by the exclusion act. Tha
c.Mef point of the appeal made on behalf
of the woman by Lyman I. Mowry, her
attorney, was that the United States
Court Commissioner had no jurisdiction
in such cases. The Court of Appeals de
cided that the Commissioner had juris
diction.
On the other point in Issue the court
held that the burden of proof in ouch
cases rests upon the Chinese persons.
The court says:
She should prove to the satisfaction of the
Commissioner the facts upon which deDended
her right to remain in the United States. This
she failed to do. Judgment of the District
Court- is affirmed.

The witnesses testified that Simpson
usually kept pounding the floor of hia

on the morning of February 16 the pound-

ran described the noise as resembling
that which would be made by a crazv
man; De Jarrac- said it resembled a
troop of cavalry drilling, and Mrs. Lyons
said it sounded as if some ona were danc
ing a reel or Irlah jig.
Simpson, in his own defense, said he
had heard queer noises himself during
nights and thought It might be due to
"spooks." He said he went to bed every
night at 8 o'clock and did not get up till
5 in the morning. His wife denied that sho

EATH gleaned a rich harvest in
San Fraocisco' yesterday when
three- of its best known citizens,
prominent in public and business
life, passed away.^ Two of the
decedents had reached that" time" of life
when the last call might at any moment
be expected, but the inclement weather
of the past three weeks did much to sap
their impaired vitality and to hasten them
to lay down the burdens of life, which
under more . favorable, conditions might
have been longer borne.
| The more, prominent of those who ex- I
pired .was Henry Lee Dodge, senior mem
ber of the wholesale grocery firm of
Dodge, Sweeney &' Co., who! died at his
lesidence, 2015 Franklin ; street, at \. 6
o'clock yesterday, morning. He had not
bten in the, best of health for a year past,
but until a v week ago he appeared -.dally
at his office. He contracted a cold which t
made rapid drains upon his vitality ': and
en , Sunday his physician, Dr. M. Herz
utein, announced that the end was inevi
table. The sick man lingered until C
o'clock yesterday morning- when Â¦ he
breathed his lost. Â¦ -.;-. ";

tion In the . schools Â¦ and academy of ; hla
native town. ; At the age of 17 : years, In

CAESAR YOUNG'S mare Eonlc
f shocked the nervous sensibilities
- of three score bettors and ten
by her mystifying showing in
' the mile and seventy yard sell
ing event, at Oakland yesterday. The
Burns handicap winner, carrying ninety
! eight pounds, and with "Texas" Winslette
in the saddle/Was played'down from 7 to
5 to even money. " Showing a dash of
speed Just after the start the favorite
gradually began falling behind, until at
the finish she' was fully twenty-five
lengths back of the leaders. Waterscratch,
the promising " three-year-old from
"GU" Summers' stable; well played ; at
Zy~, early evinced a pronounced fancy for
thti slopj>y going, and won all the way.
Bragg and Floronso fought it out for the
place, , "Willie Knapp on the first named
colt getting the verdict by a head. * The
showing of Eonic fcaused an investigation
to be made by the stewards. Dr. Talbot,
the well known veterinary, examined the
mare after the : race and reported her
temperature to be 102 2-5, with symptoms
of coughing besides. Owner Caesar Young
will appear before the track officials to
day. Â¦
The blustering condition of the weather
caused no decrease in the attendance,. the
usual Monday crowd being present. Busi
ness in the ring was brisk, and as three
choices won, while three others forgot to
make connections, honors were about
even between the pencilers and talent.
In the first event to be decided, a sprint
; over the Futurity course, Winnie O'Con
! nor had the mount on George Baldwin's
Louwelsea. The filly, while outclassing
her company, has not been doing very
well of late, Â¦ and the price receded from
4 to 9.. O'Connor waited until Killdoe, the
favorite, and Sllva Cruz,,an dutsider, had
finished. an inning out fn the lead, when
he made his move. Killdoe was very tired
v at 'the paddock and Louwelsea won easily
Nay two lengths. Clarando ran third.
ATom â¢ Mitchell, a two-year-old by Mon
tana,"with Ransch up /and 2 l A to 1, led all
the way in the "baby" event. Delsegno,
with : Woods in the saddle, came in for
strong support at odds of 3 to 2, and was
nosed out for the place by Temprano, a
15 to 1 shot."
'A small field of six started in the third
number, another Futurity course run.
-â¢Walter Jennings' fcolt Quiet had first call
in the ring, and. won cleverly. Parizade
put < up a good argument as far as "she
went; and was then led out two lengths.
Educate seems to have gone back, for
Dawson.-a 100 to 1 shot, piloted. by John
ny Daly, led the mare out for, the show. â¢
Under 'the conditions Tower of , Candles
looked to hold the other ; starters safe in
the fifth event, cantering to the post a
6 to 5 chance. Sharp Bird did not get
away from the post, and the favorite,

The latter contest is the most important
of the week. Britt's decisive defeat of
Toby,Irwin in Oakland last week . leads
to the belief that he will send Tim Heg
erty back to the Antipodes a beaten man.
The men will 'fight at. the lightweight
limit, which is 133 pounds. Hegarty may
weigh a little less. Hegarty's friends. say
that bis twelve years' experience ana
cleverness will secure him a victory.
They contend that Tim is not afraid of a
punch and . has solved a plan of battle
that will offset Britt's peculiar style of
boxing. Britt is filled with confidence*
The preliminary bouts will be as inter
i sting as the main event. Dave 'Barry
Â»-nd Harry Foley will open the pro
gramme with a ten-round bout. "Spider"
Welch and "Kid" McFjadden will make
things interesting for ten rounds. All
these men are well known to local sports
men and they will crowd Mechanics' Pa

and business and his relatives and
friends tre equally at a loss- to explain
his departure cr divine - his whereabouts.
Mr. "VVhitbeck was one of the best known
young men of Sacramento. A graduate of
the University of California, he showed
such learning that he was chosen vice
principal of the Sacramento High School
and instructor in mathematics. His
father v.as a banker and on his death left

Whitbeek made numerous investments,

On Januarv 17 "Whitbeck left Sacramen

;.. By "the death * in ; New York Saturday
afternoon - ; of 'Joseph Â¦". O'Hare, .- news of
which \ was: made public for the first time
yesterday, the estate, of the old man;
which hasbeen the subject of sensational
litigation ( for. nearly/ a ! year, will assume
a new.; phase of controversy. The initial
complications " arose because j the ' septua
genarian; conveyed*' his property .to the
_ Jacques 'familyj! by whom he -had been
'employed*: for many ''.years,, excluding the
blood - relatives ': from any ! benefits. This
was ;settlediby."a- compromise last- week,
whereby I the' Jacques , family' turned over
to the estate $42,500 in Â¦ cash,' retaining the
real conveyed to them 'by O'Hare.
This' sum,- in addition to. $10,000 received
as- payment, of two *Â¦ mortgages > held by
Q'Harej | constitutes the assets left by the
old man, arid over which a legal battle is
promised, which may develop sensational
features.'..' ,-..Â¦_â¢â¢". Â¦ : '.-\ ' -. .- ;â¢; ; Â¦ -..' ..' ' .'*-./
t O'Hare left three sisters, Mrs. Margaret
L. Gowdey -and: Mrs/ Lavinla I>ally of
Brooklyn, and fMrs. v Rogers of Minneapo
lis. Mrs. Lally. . and â¢ Mrs. Rogers each
have a daughter, making five direct heirs
to the estate. Last May Mrs.^Gowdey,
acting in conjunction with the other heirs,
applied for" letters of guardianship for
her brother, alleging that" h$ was incom
petent to handle his property.' Judge Cof
fey granjed the petition, and Mrs. Gow
dey was appointed guardian. Â¦Â¦She at once
instituted suit against, the Jacques fam
ily, to whom O'Hare had* transferred
eleven >pieces of real , estate on Leaven
worth street, valued ; at *$60,000, claiming
the conveyance . had / been secured by;
trickery, and undue influence. -This Is the
suit; that was compromised- and now -the
heirs are about to quarrel 1 over the spoils.
O'Hare's Death Announced.
.Yesterday .was set for the annual ac
counting of; the .guardian :to Judge Coffey.
When the matter; was called Mrs. Gowdey
did not appear, and then it was an
nounced- that' O'Hare had died in New
York , two days ; before. '. . .The â¢ removal of
the incompetent man. from within the jur
isdiction of '.the Probate Court was done
without -the permission : of Judge Coffey
jand without his knowledge. The Judge
was .'much disturbed by the fact, :, and
evinced' a disposition to hold the guardian
accountable for. this -breach of procedure.
â¢ Then it deveoped that ; there was a rift
between the heirs at law to the old man's
valuable "estate, and that one sister sus
pected the ; other two of attempting to
deprive her of- the share O'Hare intended
she .should" receive from Â¦ his possessions.
The matter was ; allowed to go over until
11 o'clock this morning, when Judge Cof
fey will examine further into the facts
regarding O'Hare's removal to the other
side of the continent. X Â¦ :
, Miss - Tillle ; A. Rogers, an attractive
young lady," "is one of the nieces of the
dead man, and represents her mother's
and her own interests in the controversy.
She. â¢ alleges ' that she . has Â¦ been debarred
from :seeing her. uncle for several months
past* Â¦'- liast week she applied for an order
from the court permitting her to visit
and -converse, with her uncle, and says
she presented : this | to . Joseph Hutchinson,
attorney for the guardian, who assured
her she would be allowed to see her rela-
tive at the. proper time.: Subsequently she
learned', that, her A uncle had been taken
from thejhoter'qn >thQ . Sunday preceding
the issuance- of Â¦ the* order and conveyed
.to '-New;, York without her knowledge, ac
companied by 'her aunt, Mrs. Lally.
Previous A to .this there had been a rup
ture between the niece and her two aunts,
and they were not on speaking terms, al
though they all. lived at the Hotel Oliver,
on Pine street, where O'Hare also stop
ped.,, After* O'Hare's departure for New
York, * Mrs. â¢*; Gowdey and Miss Lavinla
Lally, a female lawyer of New York, who
is^a stepdaughter of Mrs. Lally, but no
relative to O'Hare, removed . to 980 Pine
street. On receiving news of the old
man's death, Miss Lally went East im
mediately, but : Mrs. Â¦ Gowdey, the guar
dian, is still in the city. She refused to
be seen last night and -would not discuss
the controversy in any manner.
Miss | Rogers' Version.
yMiss Rogers was not so reluctant about
making known Jier side of the family tan
gle. "There has been, considerable ill
feeling between my two aunts and my
self over my uncle's affairs, and we have
not, been on speaking 'terms for' some
time,'.' she Â¦ said last night.. "I consider
that I have been badly treated by - them.
I was refuse'd access to my uncle, al
though he was right Â¦: here * in ' the hotel,"
and* would have been glad .to ; see me.
Then he was removed to New York with
out ; my ; knowledge, and I was deceived
into the belief that he was still here after
he had departed.- He was in no condition
tc : travel and the exhaustion j caused by
the long journey undoubtedly , hastened
his death.:'. ...', .' Â¦ â¢ ,:
: .'."My -motherland I have acted', in '.'this
entire matter in a way which we thought
was fair to everybody. Before my uncle
was declared' to be Incompetent he deeded
to my mother and myself the â¢. Leaven
â¢ w'orth street property, ..which, comprised
the bulk ".of the-, estate, and we voluntarily
reconveyed it to the Jacques family in or
der-that the Â¦'. compromise might - be
reached, and allowed the money received
therefrom to go to the estate. I do not
pretend to make any charges against my
aunts,, but they have acted very unjustly
toward me in this, matter. - What : their
objects have: been will appear when the
estate conies to.be finally, settled.- -
â¢ JTvrjS. Wills in. Existence.
"My" urfcle was much attached to Â¦ my
mother and myself and visited us at our
home in Minneapolis. '- He made a will pre
vious to being declared . incompetent. The
contents of this will and 1 its exact date I
: do not* know, 'and 'I do not care to state in
wh^ose custody it is. Since he was declared
incompetent he has madt another will. I
do not know- the provisions of this "will,
either, but it was made when he was un
der: the care and influence of Â¦ my two'
aunts. I am informed that the will'was
executed since; the, compromise with the
Jacques family." . : * .'.

Intestinal catarrh or catarrh of the lining
membrane of the bowels Is quite a prevalent
disease, being especially - common among men
who have seen active service in the army,
where the many changes of drinking water, the
food, and the frequently bad condition of both,
together with exposure Incident to the varying
conditions of camp and march, bring: about re-
peated attacks of acute diarrhea that leave the
lining of the bowels weak. Irritable and pre-
disposed to catarrhâ Just as repeated colds in
the head predispose to chronic nasal catarrh.
Catarrh U a constitutional disease, it Is in
the eystem. but finds vent or expression through
a ekin. In the outside or covering skin It is
Known as eczema, which disease is simply ca-
tarrh in the outside Bkln. When catarrh finds
vent through the mucous membrane lining
fkin of the various cavities and passages of the
head It is most commonly caJled catarrh. When
catarrh affects the mucous membrane or lining
skin of thÂ« air tubes leadlns to the lungs It la
UEualiy. named bronchitis. When catarrh geu
vent from the lining ekin of the female pelvic
organs it Is epoken of as leucorrbea, 'â¢ whites
and female weakness. And bo on, when the
lining tkin of other organs are affected a dis-
tinctive name may be given to the ailment,
but it is just . systemic catarrh finding a local
*xpreEÂ£ion " and vest, .and & eystemle , remedy
that will cure catarrh in one part and under
one r.8.nr.e, will cure It In any other part under
come otlier name.
The bowels are lined by. mucous membrane
that is very rauch like the lining membrane of

School Director Roncovierl proposes fo
introduce a resolution at the next meet
ing of the Board of Education for the
establishment of an ungraded class "in
each of the schools in the city. ShouM
the resolution be adopted it will neces
sitate the employment of at least fifty
additional teachers. The purpose of un
graded classes is to permit of individual
attention being given to those pupils who
mre efficient in certain studies. The plan
was proposed by Superintendent I of
Schools Webster several months ago and
gi\fi\ publicity in these columns, but no
action was taken by the board.
It is, quite likely that the present state
oJ the school funds will not permit of the
introduction of the innovation immedi

well it may be extended. 'The plan has

The court to-day did not uphold this
contention and the decision sustained the
acting administrator, W. W. Gray, as the
order appointing him appeared, regular ti
its face, and as evidence outside of tne
records would not be introduced to show
the disqualification of the Judge. The case
will probably go to the Supreme Court.
The questlon.to.be decided was the peti
tions of E. W. Putnam and others for let
ters of administration of the Turner es
tate." The appointment of the administra
tor, who was named soon after Turner's
death in 1894, was declared by petitioners
to be r-'ll and void for the reason that the
Judge vvho made . the appointment, had

Percy took a piece of ore that weighed
close to five pounds and on Ms return to
camp put it into a common portable
forge and gave it a roasting. The ore
exuded drops of a whitish metal, like fat
from a piece of bacon, and when the test
was over a large button. of the metal was
found, which Percy brought to tbhs city
for analysis. He took it to an assay
office, and asked for a quantitative analy
sis. The analysis showed that the button
was very nearly pure tin.
Percy is. wondering -if he has at last
struck the mother, lode of .the tin de
posits of this region. He will leave here
at once to complete his locations and gat
more samples. He refuses to divulge, the
location of the deposit; In fact, since the
result of the assay was- announced,- is
disposed to keep silent about the Â¦ dis
covery altogether. ...' .
The Importance of such a ' discovery,
should the immense ledge prove to be. all
tin, can hardly be measured In dollars,
and mining men are. greatly excited over
the prospect of having a real tin deposit
in this section of the country. Percy says
that if the entire ledge will run one
fourth as heavy as the sample taken the
deposit is fabulously rich. â¢ -

two weeks ago to examine some prop
erty. While .there- his attention was
called to -an enormous deposit of -ledge .
matter highly mineralized.; He examined
it closely and traced it nearly six miles,
its width being 200 feet. It is one of tho

VICTOR, Colo., Feb. ', Â«.â Cripple Creek
Is in a state of terror owing to. a pre
concerted attack upon assay offices doing
business In the district. Beginning: at 3
o clock this morning: and following in
rapid succession, six explosions wrecked
as many assay . offices in Victor, Cripple
Creek and Goldfleld. The wreckers did
not hesitate to jeopardize life, as all but
one of the buildings were also occupied
by sleeping families. Men, " women and
children were. hurled out of. their beds by
the shocks and serious injuries Inflicted.
The full extent of the damage cannot be
estimated. * ,
In this city the Davenport office was
wrecked by two explosions, involving a
loss of $12uO. Almost af the same time
the assay offices of Vanderwalker, Mor
gan & Williams were similarly destroyed.
The loss was approximately -as large as
at Davenport's. A miner was passing
"Williams' office at the moment ' of tho
explosion. Flying debris struck him in
the face, gashing his eyes. â¢ His Injuries
may result In total blindness. In Cripple
Creek, Benjamin's assay office, located
near the Florence and Cripple Creek de
pot, was blown up, but was only partially
wrecked. * ' â¢ *- â¢ .
. In the town of Goldfleld, about a mile
and. a half north of here, almost simul
taneously Boyce's and Swinhart's offices
were blown up, Mrs. Boyce was blown
out of bed, but escaped without fatal in
juries. '
A family near the assay office was also
blown out of bed, but fortunately escaped
serious injury. . "
The giant powder was blown through
the windows at Goldfleld. In this city me
powder was placed .under the building.' -
The house in which a family lived next
to Williams' . assay office here was dam
aged and a woman was prostrated by the.
'shock and is at present hysterical.
-Sheriff Robertson called his deputies
and his force is taking ail means. to dis
cover it possible the . perpetrators of the
crimes. * The ; general impression here is
that the acts . are the result of a general
movement to rid the â¢ district of all in
stitutions which buy high-grade ore In
small quantities.* The big mines of the
district, it is alleged, Â¦ have been syste
matically robbed of much rich ore, and
from 50 to 100 assayers, it is said, have
made handsome profits by dealing In this
ore. The mine owners also recently dis
covered that high-grade ore was being
shipped by assayers from this district to
a smelter at Salt Lake and to the Selby
smelter at San Francisco, but all their
efforts to stop the traffic werÂ© unavail

CHICAGO, Feb. 24.â Everything ln wheat
was bearish from tho very start. Cables were
lower, receipts were Improved and the weather
gave promise of, sunshine for some |lme to
come. Crops wera reported in excellent con
dition. Reports 'of grain receipts for to-mor
row were double what they were to-day. A8
a result tho liquidation was heavy and con
tinuous. The foreign demand is still very light'
and the demand from stock feeders Is becoming
good because of the good weather. May open
ed >>i<8>%c lower at 77J4@77c and dropped to
76tfc. Covering on the break steadied things
for a whllo and when a decrease ln the visible
supply of 1.021,000 bushels was posted the
market strengthened a bit. Just before the
close, however, the. general feeling that wheat
was too plentiful swept over the floor Rnd with
hardly a struggle May dropped another cent
to 76>Ac. May closed very weak, l;Â£c lower
at 75%@75%c. Corn again suffered from in
creased country offerings and a decreased de
mand from Western feeders. Cables were lower,
the Southwestern markets were very weak and
fair weather was universal In the country most
needing it. May. started about %c down at
00*j4c In company with wheat and hardly
paused until it had struck GO'tf&KHic. The
weakening of the holding sentiment on the
part of tho farmers was reflected Â¦ In the pit
with a higher intensity and liquidation of spec
ulative holding went on at an enormous rate.
Nearly every house on the floor took part ln
the selling, which was for both local and
country account. , May closed very weak, l*^o
down, at 59"4c. â¢

decreased 1,147.000 bushels. . .
"â¢ Chicago opened heavy, with, liquidation and
stop-loss selling. \There was considerable real
izing by '.holders.'. Everybody seemed .loaded
with v.beat and high-priced corn and oats,
with the bulls . tired out and selling. The
weakness seemed to be caused by favorable
weather, poor cash demand and prospects lor
Increasing receipts. Nebraska sent In a very
optimistic report: plenty of snow covering, '2">
per cent -more winter wheat acreage than last
year, with -farmers contemplating the planting
of considerable- spring wheat, and the outlook
for a big crop favorable. Under all .these con
ditons the Chicago market declined 2a .

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
'Receipts /of Butter since Friday have been
liberal,', but they were taken up by the good i
demand' and the. floors ' are still slenderly!
stocked* Prices for all descriptions are firm.
Receipts of Cheese have been running lighter
Of; late and the market is quoted steady at
the prices which have ruled for some time.
There are now more Eggs jon the market
than for a month, and the market is trembling
on the edge of a decline. Dealers say that if
the shipping demand. continues quotations will
probably be fairly sustained for 'a few days.!
but. if it ceases and the market has to depend
on the local Inquiry, there will be a break.
A day. or eo will decide the matter, and mean-*

Pried Fruits in New York
Mail reports from New York say: "In^ a
Kcneral way the market shows few important
features, but for most descriptions in the list '
there is noted a good jobbing interest and ecsne
firmness among holders. In prunes Ihe aggre
gate buEiness doing is of fair proportions, and
while on California offerings prices show no
material change the feeling is steady, with a.
somewhat firmer tendency. On 40-5OS in 25-lb
boxes strictly new Santa Clara fruit Is offered
at 6Â»4c by most holders. Outside fruit is een
erally held at ti^c Sixes t>0-70s are reported
.in lighter supply "and the situation is perhaps
stronger. The outlet through the list is good.
Spot Oregon .prunes, Â»*-4ys, are firmer, with
stocks cleaning up. Inside quotation is now
0%c but the" general view is "ic higher. Sizes
46-5Qs offer at 5\'c to 5"Â£c in 25-lb boxes. Coast
Â¦ advices on California prunes note a strong feel
ing, but no important change. Oregon advices
report the situation practically cleaned up from
first hands. In raisins the spot market is quiet.
A little inquiry and buying of seeded in a Job
bing way is noted at from S*Â£c to 8%c for
choice and S'.ic to S%c for fancy 1-lb cartons.
Valencia layer raisins are steady.
Â¦'In view of a more active Buying interest
siiown in epot apricots and peaches, there was
noted to-day a much stronger feeling in both
Â¦inscriptions. Spot stocks are reported con
siderably below the usual holdings at this sea
son for both peaches and apricots. Some eÂ»
timates place Â«pot stocks of thf latter at less
than 20 car loads, with the bulk of the hold
ing? in tcvr hands. Within the last two days
efforts to buy from the coast have been turned
down at prices wired here earjy in the week
iÂ» the principal holders there. Spot is quoted
at from 8*&e to ll^c on' choice and fancy
Uoyals in bags and from 10c to 12c In boxes.
and 10'io to 12c for choice and fancy* Moor
parks in* bags and 12c to 13*4c for boxes.
"Private advices from the Coast ln this con
nection state: Stocks of apricots on the
Coast in first hands are now figured to be less
than 30 car loads, chiffiy of better than choic-Â«
and fancy grades. The Ideas of holders - are
exceedingly strong and now rule, on a. basis
slightly above the parity of cost to lay down
in the Eastern markets. There is a good de
mand from interior points for the fruit, and no
disposition shown on the part of holders to re
duce their ideas. Stock* of peaches do -Â«iot
exceed iKi car loads all told."

FLORENCE MOORE STILL v
OWNS BLYTHE ESTAT2'
Â¦ ;
I Secret Service Agents Harry Moffltt and
Thomas Foster have unearthed the crim
inal record of James H. McDonough.
alias J. H. Meyer, who was arrested last
week with Kred Grey In their rooms at
748 Harrison street, where were found"
counterfeiting tools. and bogus money.
The officers report that McDonough was
sent to the Folsom Penitentiary on Sep-:
.tember 2, 1S78, to serve a one-year sen>*
tence for burglary committed in this citv
His name appears on the penitentiary
record as Henry Meyer, alias "Virginia
Jim,' and. his number was 4496.
:â¢ McDonough admitted yesterday that it
waÂ» he who shot Conductor Massey a few
years ago. He was acquitted on the plea
of self-defense. Before he,- and Fred Grey
were taken before United States Court
Commissioner Heacock yesterday McDon
ough remarked to the secret service men
that he thought Grey wanted to lug him
to the penitentiary with him. He said
also that the counterfeiting tools found la
his valise did not belong to him, but that
they had been placed there by Grey, un
known to him. Commissioner Heacock
held both men to answer before the Fed
each Grand Jury * with bal1 flxed at *2UC9
1 They have been charged with conspirlns
to defraud the United States by counter
feiting, or preparing to counterfeit, its
coin. A charge of counterfeiting was not
preferred against them on account of the
decision of United States District Judzs
de Haven in the Krick case. The Frick*.
father and son,- -were caught with coun
terfeit ten-dollar pieces .in their posses
sion. These pieces were of white metal
and had not been gilded. Judge de Ha
yen ruled that not being- gilded, and be
ing of the color of silver, they could not
deceive any one. Similar coins were found,
in the possession of Grey and McDon
ough, and because of the Frick decision
a charge of being in possession of coun
terfeit money was not made.
Wednesday at 10 a. m. was set as tha
time for their examination.
Attorney Collins, then asked Anderson
as -to any paintings he- had seen Â¦ ih the
De Bretteville home, but ahe ; defendant
replied that he could not remember hav
ing, seen any there, ,-i.
Collins then proceeded to read off a list
of paintings, â¢ tne work of the fair Alma,
but to each title Anderson answered that
he was Ignorant of. the work.
"Did vou'. ever see a painting entitled
'Bon Jour?," asked- Collins. Â¦:,Â¦--,
"What's that?" shouted ; Anderson.
Collins repeated his question and in
formed the defendant that the two final
words were French.
"I never saw anything like ' that," an
swered Anderson, and the courtroom of
people laughed.- t .
Anderson was then excused and A. C.
Ahlers * and J. -D. Abrams, salesmen for
jewelry houses, were placed on the stand.
They testified that Anderson had- come
to the stores and ; purchased the rings
produced in evidence and that Miss de
Bretteville had not previously called and
selected the gems. .-; Â¦ .. .
Attorney Barnes In cross-examination
elicited from the witnesses t$at the plain
tiff might have called at the stores and
picked. out the rings without their know-
Gus . Cornelius testified that Anderson
had once ' told him in a saloon that he
was engaged to Miss de Bretteville, but
cross-examination brought . out . answers
showing that Cornelius 'Â¦ was - not over
friendly to Anderson. , ' '..%^eSfi*8Es
Oscar and Gus ' de Bretteville, brothers
of the plaintiff, testified that they had
never gone down town -to request An
derson' to visit their home, but that he
always'came there, of his own accord.
The hearing was then adjourned and
will be resumed this morning- at 10
o'clock, when the â¢ plaintiff will take the
witness- stand*-
How Anderson vMade His Stake.
How â¢ Charles ' i. Anderson made his
first stake In the Klondike is one of the
romances of that northern mining district;
and the tale is one that is being told often
now ' When George Carmack, the discov
erer of those wonderful diggings, went to
Circle City, and reported that he ; had
found gold ' on Dawson creeks there , was
a stampede. Anderson, Bill McPhee," Bill
English. Hank Somers, Jack McQuesten,
Tom O'Brien, Olaf Nelson,: Joe Picotte,
Joe Hunker, Alex -McDonald and others
rushed in. Claims were located on El
Domdo and Bonanza creeks.
AH was excitement and flurry. . The
"Pioneer Saloon" was opened, and one
night Anderson, who had been moderately
successful in the placer diggings about
Circle City, was treating the house, round
after round. He was induced to purchase
a claim on El Dorado. No.- 13. He gave
$S00 for it, all the money he had. 1 A bill
of 'tale was made out and Anderson had
it located and recorded. Â¦ .
He worked it for. a few days, but It did
not -turn, out as: he had expected. Then
he get mad. He went to the chief of tÂ»ie
mounted police and 'demanded . the arrest
of the men who sold him the claim.
"You have a bill of sale for it?" quer
ied-the official. / '
"Yes, but I don't want'it," said Ander
son. * 'â¢ . â¢ Â¦'Â¦-":'.'Â¦
"Better go and try It; out," said tne
chief: "You have your, bill of sale; you
have V the 1 place., and. the other fellows,
have gone. What are you going to do?"
Anderson walked out sullenly and jvent
â¢to his 'claim.' About a week later he
walked into Dawson, laid a few ounces
of gold dust on, .the bar, and invited
everybody to "tak a trink.V v.
Charlie Anderson was the hero of the
camp from Â¦ that time on. < Much' of the
money that-he'got through thaf night
. when he * was ! apparently - played Â¦ : for a

Attorney ; Collins then asked Anderson
if he had not asked Mrs. C. F. Anderson,
just previous -to, her marriage, to "throw
the other fellow ever and marry him,"
to .which . the defendant replied with
anger?- Â¦' â¢
. ."Nor "I: never" did. so, and. I would not
have her if she had millions." The un
' gallant reply was ordered stricken from
.*.he record.: -
The examination of Anderson proceed- j
ed as foM6ws: - .
Â¦"How much time- did you spend in Miss
de Bretteville's comoany?" *
. ."About ?loC0." ... . ,
; "I did net ask you how much money,
but how much time."- Â¦ â¢
"I spent about five. weeks with her and
it cost me $1500." â¢ . ; .
"Did you ever kiss her of your own
accord?'.' -
"No; she always kissed me first, and
then only 1 if I gave her a present."
"You, found no i trouble In kissing: her
on account of her height?" .
i "No; she always came .down to meet
me." Â¦ Â¦ . . Â¦ ' .
. ."Did you ever kiss any other member
of her family?" ;.
"No; she was the only good-looking one
of the whole lot." Â¦ .
Anderson â¢. then testified that Alma had
once -asked him to marry her and that
he - had scorned the proposition for; the
reason . that: he" had recently -been di
vorced.' He claimed that r Alma desired
him -to take her to Nevada or Mexico
: and there join -her in wedlock, but that

Attorney General." TIrey \.L. . Ford ap
peared for the State and , the- commission.
He was assisted by Attorney Frank A.
Short of Fresno. " 'â¢
Garret McEnerney, Peter F. Dunne
and J. E. Foulds appeared for the rail
road company. Ex-Judge Sterry ' was
present, on behalf of the Santa Fe, but
he took no part in the -proceedings.-.
Attorney General Ford made a master
ly argument in favor of setting aside the
injunction and maintaining the low. rate
decided upon by the Railroad '. Commis
sioners, which he said was just and equit
able and decided upon after a careful
consideration of the expenses: the rail
road company were under.in transporting
the ojl from the oil fields to the," local
markets. He pointed out the necessity of
maintaining the low -rate so that the oil
producers 'could realize a reasonable* and
lair profit on the. industry: upon' '.which
much^of the t prosperity of the southern
portion of the State depends.- â¢ -.i-. Â¦
He-took the. position that it was with
in the province of the Railroad Commis
sioners to decide .upon .what they deemed
a fair and reasonable rate, of transporta
tion and that having done so it was not
within ; the jurisdiction of .the court to set
iheirfindlnes aside. ';â¢'-->.'Â¦ ~
! Considerable interest' was manifested In
the argument made by the Attorney Gen
eral. There were . quite -:-a number *of
rrominent oil producers present from
Bakersfleld and other near by sections.
Attorney Foulds, representing the'rail
icad company, followed Attorney General
Ford. He argued that the Railroad Com
missioners* . rate was arbitrary and /un
just and away below the actual -cost of
transporting the oil. Mr. Foulds stated
that it would be. impossible for : the rail
read company to carry, out the mandates
of the Commissioners without entailing a
considerable loss. 'â¢ - ; . "Â¦ .
Attorney Dunne next ' addressed ' the
-fiurt for the Southern Pacific Company.
He read' a number of decisions from
r.iany courts that had. decided-' that a
Railroad Commission had no legal right
tc impose an unjust, discriminating rate
en the transportation Â¦ of passengers : or
freight. He said, that the rate of 42 cents
;>er barrel originally fixed voluntarily by
the railroad 'company was the lowest, pos
sible rate the railroad ' company could
i,tand. u :r7- .:;..Â¦. j v - â¢ ; Â¦ Â¦ . - --Â¦Â¦;: â¢. -
Garret McEnerney followed Mr s Foulds
and made a masterly argument against
xho. dissolving of.. the injunction and tho
cemurrer to the railroad company's com
plaint. McEnerney quoted a number of
decisions from the United States Supreme
Court in support of the position that the
.Railroad Commissioners could not enforce
m unjust rate. He stated that even in
cases where the railroad eomoany had
voluntarily fixed a low rate for the trans
portation of any class of freight or pas
sengers it was not within the province of
a commission or Legislature to. force
ihÂ«m to continue that rate if they deemed
it too low to make a reasonable profit. Â¦
Judge Hebbard adjourned court at the
conclusion of McEnerney's argument. At
torney Short will make the final argu
ment on, the Railroad Commission's side
of the . controversy this morning. It : s
expected that he will -produce convincing
arguments in favor of the low rate and
the enforcement of the Railroad Commis
sion's edicts. .-Â¦â¢Â¦-â¢
