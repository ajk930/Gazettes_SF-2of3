unique message something like this: "One
â¢lay of violet in light blue," or "one day
of primrose in changeable lavender."
This may read like a conundrum to the
uninitiated, but the manufacturer who re
ceives it will understand perfectlyâ he
knows that for one day of violet he must
set his loom to weave so many yards of
t-ilk. with a. violet design in bud, which the
lair customer wishes for a morning dress.
The design signifies that the sun is not
yet high. Then he knows that he must
change the loom all over again to weave
the same pattern in a full-blown flower
fcr the midday dress, for every well
dressed Chinese woman changes her gown
four times a day. The afternoon or twi
light violet dress will have the violet half
closed and tho evening gown srll! bf course
be symbolized by a tightly closed flower.
The tsame dye of blue will suffice for the
four dresses and the flower is woven in
tho eame shade, so the ivory skinned,
lily footed wearer will appear all one day
in the same shade of blue, yet her dress
will be In perfect taste, for she keeps tab
of the hour and wears the proper weave
at the proper time, thereby defying
criticism of even the most exacting fol
lower of fashion.

one design. Sometimes they axe in color

are generally light pink or dainty blue

ventional designs; any color or harmony
of colors may be used In any part of
tho costume except a solid yellow, that
sunny shade being: - reserved for the
robes of royalty. White enters not at
all into the wardrobe, for it Is the Chi

the Oriental custom from the American
Is the wearing of Jewels. and the dressing
of tht hair.

offers much the same opportunity that thÂ«
dawn of Easter does to the American. .
The local tailors, wise In the art of

of conceiving:, attractive designs and of
harmonizing shades, are more than busy.

local dressmaker, shops are to please the
fancy of the merchants' â¢ wives ; only and
of the lesser lights who can afford them,
for the robes of the aristocracy or of the

Consul Yo How.. Although the little lady

ate court dresses' or full dress costumes,
walking dresses, gowns for morning; noon
and night, all colors and designs.
Although .the cut of .the Chinese gar
ments worn by either sex differs but little
from one decade to. another, the authori
ties have declared a Blight change for this
court dress of Lady Ho. The "royal
patch/' is a solid block of Intricately de
signed embroidery, with varying colors
purple, green, blue, lavender, a dash of
red and a great deal of gold; a band of
gold passementerie trims the edge. In the
very center of the square, resting upon a
eolld embroidery of gold, rests the Insignia.
The bottom oMhe frock matches the yoko
of lavender. The sleeves are of light pink,
with a broad band of embroidered mauve
the color of the waist; the cording at the
bottom of the sleeve Is of black. The
waist is softly padded throughout and is
lined In a royal purple silk. The skirt to
be worn with this is a light buff In color.
A Chinese skirt is an apronllke affair
of two parts â one apron' In front, one in
the back; the sides are opened, although
the voluminous pleats give- an appear
ance of a full, round skirt. A "full dress
is Â¦ always ' made with . one hundred tiny
pleats; an ordinary costume is by the
laws of dres3 etiquette regulated to only
thirty. The official skirt has a* panel of
: solid embroidery, a sort of landscape, in
which two deer and some flying 1 birds ap
pear; the bottom Is embroidered, with,
roses, with green and yellow leaves: the
pleats come full on the side, â¢ Altogether
the gown is one - of the most elaborate
ever shown In* this city.
a black spiral in a fanciful half flower
means prosperity, another of different
color happiness, and so on. Superstition
and poetry are so closely woven that it is
difficult to distinguish one from, the other,
but in this instance both are attractive
and beautiful, r
Another pretty gown which eouldbeused
for either a reception or a walking gown
is of dark green, with rows of black satin
bands; designs of black ratin ornament
the waist: the sleeves are of a purplish
shade with a broad border of buff silk;
the edging Is of green, the skirt has a
panel embroidered with a landscape, a
rice field with several flying storks; an
other has embroidered on the skirt n.
basket of fruits, on either side of which
sits a ducks.
Butterflies and chrysanthemums are fa
vorite designs for embroidery, although
an occasional pagoda or teahouse appear
in the walking gowns. The Chinese dresc
for men almost never changes, although
the same rules In regard to observing the
seasons and times of day are carried out
in the woven patterns, of their gowns.
The dresses for ladies of degree are al
ways with skirts; those of the middle
classes or servants are, made with tho
broad trousers
ladles of rank are all imported direct from
China. The last steamer from across the
Pacific brought a consignment of gowns
for some of the local four hundred. The
daintiest of dainty Bilks, all folded In soft
mulberry paper, that smells dellclously
of sandal wood; sky blues, lavenders,
pinks, sea greens and all the beautiful
intermediate shades no one but the Chi
nese seem to have grasped the secret of
dyeing. . ....
A number of N official gowns, or frocks,
as they call them, arrived for that charm-'
- .
1
new century. The beautiful long-flowing
Eleeves of the top garment, or waist part,
are this year much narrower at the wrist,
where formerly an opening: of twenty-four
Inches flopped over the hand, i The width
Is now diminished to about fifteen. The
body part, or waist, has also under* one a
slightâ a very , slightâ change, that of
taking the. under arm seams a trifle more
deep, and this brings the garment a bit
more snug, across the chest and through
the waist, although to the uninitiated eye
the change la unnotlceable.
The official court dress for Lady Ho
Tow Is one of the most beautiful of this
'year's gowns, a wonderful harmony of
color and Intricate design In hand em
broidery and gold passementerie. The
body of the waist ia the richest of dark
plum, shading to mauve; a lavender yoke
about eight Inches in depth Is edged with
a border. of gold passementerie, on either
side of which is a tiny cording -of black.'

or "royal patch," It is called. The insig

patch. For first rank It is a pheasant;
the second and third are 'also pheasants,
less elaborated; the fourth rank Is a pea
cock; the fifth is a atork. The pheasant, or

prettiest Is In chrysanthemum design.
The body of the waist Is of lavendert
broad Â«larvÂ«Â« of light pink trimmed wltb
alternate stripes of silvery gray, em
broidered with, white. The body of the
frock Is trimmed with narrow gray em
broidery and Chinese lace to match. Most
of the gowns are made with yokes; the
one In this Is light blue edged with a
cording of pink. The button design on
this artistic creation Is three chrysanthe
mums on one side, a tiny butterfly on the
other; jeweled buttons of pink, lavender
and gray match the gown. A skirt with
panels of embroidered chrysanthemums,
pleats of plain silk, goes with this frock.
Another Is of dark purple, with body
upon which large tulips in black velvet
are appllqued; sleeves of buff, with bands
of indescribable green, corded with tulip
design In black. Green jade stone (lucky
stone) .buttons are on this garment.

is one of the daintiest; the body of the

Interest the decrees put forth by Madame
La Mode, that capricious, fastidious au
thority of Southern China.
The manner of dress In the Orient Is a
most Important one, for It at once deter
mines the rank, the official standing, the
financial Â¦worth and the artistic taste of
the wearer. Nowhere In all the world has
the poetry of nature been combined In the
national dress as It Is In the native cos
tumes of that country. The four distinct
seasons, spring, summer, autumn and
winter, also the four divisions of the day,
morning, midday, twilight and night, all
play a most Important part in the fash
ionable attire of the aristocratic Chinese,
for these seasons are all symbolized by
Kome representation of nature, woven in
the fabric, or signified by the design of
trimming. When a. Chinese belle or ma
tron orders a new gown she will dip the
slim little brush in the black, pasty ink
The most serious breach of etiquette a
Chinese lady can commit in dress Is to
wear the wrong flower at the wrong
time of thÂ« day or season â for Instance,
a full-blow^i flower at night or a spring
primrose In winter. For the spring
gowns there is a choice of all the flow
ers In seasonâ the primrose, the violet,
the rose and the young bamboo is often
chosen in its varying developments. In
summer the fashions change; the spring
flower dresses must be laid aside and
their place is taken ty summer flower de
signs. The t-utumn is generally symbol
ized by leaves or chrysanthemums.
For winter the fastidious dresser of
either sex may order gowns all woven
with landscape designs; a solid col
or of dainty buff, pink or blue may
have a pastoral woven In, and here, too,
the four seasons play their part. A
bright spring scene appears in the silk
for the morning gown, summer for mid
day, autumn for twilight and winter for
night The seasons do not, however,
regulate the colors. The gayest or the
most delicate may be used for any sea
sonâthat part is dependent upon the
taste of the wearer.
An ordinarily well dressed Chinese
woman will have in her wardrobe f at
least fifty gowns and about teu pairs
tidious. Each Chinese lady counts among
her possessions at least three fans for
various occasions.
The Chinese New Tear, commencing the
first week In February, will be ushered in
not only by the boom of a million fire
crackers, the clang of cymbals and punk
burning in houses of worship, but i it wHl
bÂ« welcomed by the gayest of gay attire.

agnation deeoer under the surface than

the first official function of the season.
That Lady Pauncefote should have led

It overthrew or waved aside the very,

have known it, but they need ' never to
have fluttered a single flutter or puzzled
their pretty brains for a moment.
In this glorious country of ours, which
we are proud to call absolutely demo
cratic, and to whose private and. semi
private social functions no rigid lines of
dogmatic court etiquette are known, we
have declared with vaunting vanity the
social gospel of the national capital â¢ Is

..'Herr'von Holleben, the German Embas
sador, 'Â«' has had some little difficulty in
explaining . that Lady ' Pauncef ote- -should
have: assumed^ first -place on "the New
Year's reception In the White 'House In
the absence of her husband, the dean et
the Diplomatic Corps. The suggestion
that she occupy the place that Lord
Pauncef ote would hare been In did not
meet-, the approval of 'diplomats, who
would as soon violate an International
law as' the ironclad rules of their social
training and Instruction.
The Idea that the representative of a
country really does represent the rei gra
ins power Is apparently quite forgotten
at times In what we may call our national
desire to have things "go smoothly."
There Is a story told. of a dinner given
in Washington when the wife of the Eng
lish Embassador was taken in by, or.
rather, assigned to , the escort of the
young son of the house, the reason given
being that he was the only "heir appar
ent". Like most of the stories about pre
cedence,' this cannot be verified, but It
serves as a capital anecdote to relate.
It will be remembered that at the Â«Â«"te
of ' General Grant's funeral there was a
most serious discussion anent who should
lead, the English Embassador or the Vic*
President, and It was said the only way to
set the difficulty was to let the embassa
dor ride on the hearse.
The rule that the foreign embasaador
who has held his office for th# longest
term of years is the dean, and ranks first,
has simplified matters somewhat, for none
can be found .' to cavil at so practical
a rule. .The rule as to the wife of each
Minister Is carried out In .the same order.
.The rule that an embassador or Minis
ter shall always take in to dinner the wife

stories' is to the . effect that one dating

PRECEDENCE: THE BURNING TOPIC OF THE HOUR AT WASHINGTONpast; but there still remain the semi
official functions, and In these must the
statute of social precedence be regarded
no less scrupulously* At even a private
livery hostess must needs know her
"Washington" now, for the sharp eyes
that are watching the newly launched es
pecially are very tender books to- hÂ»r
who may Inadvertently "put her foot into
it." Social precedence Is the grammar,
the arithmetic, the algebra of the woman
who would or who must entertain.
"Must", sounds a bit harsh, perhaps, to
the lay mind: but "must" it is, for the
laws of the Medes and Persians were no
more Impregnable than the Inflexible
edict, backed by the Cabinet, to which
even the "First Lady" must yield.
Mrs. Roosevelt must hold just so many
public receptions: the wives of Cabinet
members must entertain at Intervals.
None has dared defy, or will ever one ig
nore this requirement. - '
The formal, official entertainments are
when sharply called to task for having
done so by some of the women present r#Â»
plied that she thought "the poor man had
had such a hard winter of It without any
fun ehe was unwilling to have him go
back to his court without one enjoyable
dinner, and she had sent for, him before

fatally In a person of less rugged consti

amazing. Her temperament Is of that
even, broad-minded type that directly
aids in throwing off the effects of the
burn. She displayed remarkable courage

Injury and subsequently at, the surgical

Courageously she faced the ordeal, and

Into an alarming weakness, due to the
severe shock, Dr. Stlnson says now that
she will not only completely recover her
health and strength, but that there will
not be left a single blemish of the skin
to remind her of the tragio accident.
More than that, he says the skin will be
softer and whiter than ever before, so
that out of a strange trick of fate 'she
will gain even an added beauty.
It .was hard to tell, he said. It would
all depend on how quickly her blood re
sponded to the healing. All her patience
and f ortltude- would be- required^ to avert
the disfiguring scars. She would have to
lie on her left side, the least seriously
jj blistered of her whole body, with her
right arm bound to the finger tips, with
out moving for days and nights.
It .was an awful sacrifice to make for
Â«o trivial an accident before she had yet

one who has never been even passably

"It Is generally conceded," says Dr.
Stlnson, "that a burn covering one-third
to one-half of the full surface of the body
will result fatally in from twenty-four to
forty-eight hours." But when the anxious
sisters asked him If she wc-uld live he
answered that she would, . because she
has always had such superb health' and
strength. The sufferer, struggling to con

and smilingly assured them that she had
no doubt of her recovery.

gave her an opiate to lull her Into uncon

powerful enough to quiet the trembling
body, while he bound her in a filmy gauze
swathed in cotton held in place by oiled
silk.
The oil was quickly broughtâ a whole
gallon of itâ and poured over her quiver
ing body from head to heel, without doing
much to relieve her; but It was not so
easy to get the doctor. The "line was
busy." Another telephone on the floor
above was tried. Dr. Hall, the family
physician, was not in his office. One or
two mere doctors were cayed for, with
like result. The outlook was growing des
perate. Every moment meant not only
excruciating pain, but perhaps speedy
death. ' More oil was poured over the red
dening wounds, until the bed to which she
had staggered was saturated through and

"Get some olive oil, Wanda," she or

her sisters, almost frantic with the cerro*
of the situation, took hold of herfagain
and raised her to her feet.
The agony of her position is too terriblo
to describe. Any one less powerful and
eelf-reliant would have succumbed at
once. The danger only sharpened her
presence of mind.
â¢'I thought of Just three things," she
eald afterward in describing her sensa
tions.
?This is a calamity."
"Save your face."
â¢'Poor little Laura Lambert."
And with these thoughts running
through her brain she struggled to keep
her head out of the seething water, whils
Groping through the haze they grasped
her left arm, the only part of her body
not entirely eubmerged 'In the scalding
water, and dragged her out. When al
most clear of the tub she slipped from
their clutch and fell back again. ,
The bathtub In her home at 1332 Page
street had become full almost to over
flowing with water hot to the point of
boiling. Through the blinding cloud of
steam she fumbled to shut it off. Her
foot slipped on the polished floor, she lost
her balance and plunged headlong into the
tub. Her agonized scream brought her
two Bisters to her aid.
Never before had there been such a re
gal looking Queen of the Mardi Gras in
this city. Tall and statuesqueâ almost as
tall as the King of the Carnival himselfâ
with arms and shoulders exquisitely
rounded and a figure cast in nature's
rarest heroic mold, she was the most
striking looking woman in all that long
profession of San Francisco's lovely
women, and right royally, as was befit
ting her station, she reigned over "her
merry subjects, and when the night was
done the fame of it all followed her out
Into the world to Bet the standard for
those who would rival her hereafter. Hers
is indeed a beauty that will create a hlB
tory of treasurable traditions all its own.
And then two weeks ago, by the merest
accidentâ an accident bo simple that one
â¢wonders that It could have happened at
allâ not only her beauty but her life Itself
was placed In instant jeopardy.
Attired as the Queen of Sheba in robes
of finest texture and rich Oriental color
ing, ornamented with strings of pearls
and glittering jewels and with a hooded
crown of pearls and rubies covering her
dark hair, she rivaled in splendor even
the gorgeousness of her famed prototype.
It Is an honor secretly coveted by many
and proudly remembered by the few who
have had the distinction conferred upon
them. And beautiful queens there have
been before at this big fancy ball, with
which society annually closes the winter
gayety in a blaze of glory before turning
to its Lenten devotions, but none have
created such a furor as Miss Hadenfeldt.
Beauty that won for her the proud dis
tinction cf Queen of the memorable
Goethe-Schiller Festival at the Mechanics'
Pavilion when she was only a girl in her
teens, and beauty that brought her a etill
greater triumph when she was chosen
from out the gay throng of merry mask
ers to reign as Queen of the Mardi Gras
at the Hopkins Art Association two years
ago.
And a notable beauty it is and haa been
since earliest infancy; not the plastic
beauty of mere perfection of face and fig
ure, but the temperamentel beauty that
combines symmetry of form and feature
Â¦with the expressive moods of the woman
of culture and refinement.

athletic exercise in the open airâswim

of a moving shadow before him close to
the ground, which set the blood cours

It' was the figure of an Indian crawling
on his hands and knees toward the coach,
scarcely forty yards away. For the first I
time that afternoon Boyle's calm- good
humor was overswept by a blind and
furlous rage. Yet even then he was sane
enough to remember that a pistol shot
would alarm the girl, and to keep that
weapon as a last resource. For an In
stant he crept forward as , silently ,\ and
stealthily as the savage, and then, with a
sudden bound, leaped upon him,, driving
his head and shoulders down against the
rocks before, he could utter a cry, and

"Our men?" repeated Boyle, blankly.

of the regulation cavalry horseshoe â not
of Foster's team, nor of "Indian ponies,
who never havesany! Don't you see?"
she went on eagerly, "our men have got

went on, pointing to the hoof prints
coming from the plain. "They've antici

"But if they, were the same escort you
spoke of, they must have known you
were here, and haveâ" he was about to
say "abandoned you," but checked him

soldiers.
"They knew I could take care of my
self, and wouldn't stand in the way of
their duty." said the young girl, antici
pating him -with quick professional pride
that seemed to fit her aquiline nose and
tall figure. "And If they knew that."
she added, softening with a mischievous
smile, "they also knew, of course, that
I was protected by a gallant stranger
vouched for by Mr. Foster! No!" she
added with a certain blind, devoted con
fidence, which Boyle noticed with a
slight wince that she had never shown
before, "it's all. right! and 'by orders,'
Mr. Boyle, and when they've done their
v.crk they'll be back."
But Boyle's masculine common sense
â¢was, perhaps, safer than Miss Cantlre's
feminine faith and inherited discipline,
for In an instant he suddenly compre
hended the actual truth! The Indians
had been there first; they had despoiled
the coach and got off safely with their
booty and prisoners on the approach of
the escortâ who were now naturally
pursuing them with a fury aroused bv
the belief that their commander's
daughter was one of their prisoner?
This conviction was a dreadful one, yet
a relief as far as the young girl was con
cerned. But should he tell her? No!
Better that she should keep her calni
faith in the triumphant promptness of
the soldlers-and their speedy return.
"I dare say you are right." he said
cheerfully, "and let us be thankful that
m the empty coach you'll have at least
a half civilized shelter until they return
Meantime I'll go and reconnoiter* a
"I will go with you." she said
But Boyle pointed out to her so strong
ly the necessity of her remaining to xvait
for the return of the soldiers that be
ing also fagged out by her long climb
she obediently consented, while he. even
with this inspiration of .the truth, did
not believe in the return of the despoll
ers, and knew she would be safe.
A few steps into the thicket brought
him full upon a realization of more than
his worst convictionsâ the dead body
of Foster! Near it lay the body of the
mall agent. Both had been evidently
dragged Into the thicket from where
they fell, scalped and half stripped.
There was no â¢ evidence of any later
struggle;- they must have been dead
when they were brought there
Boyle was neither a hard-hearted nor
an unduly sensitive, man. He was sorry
for these two men, and would have
fought, to have saved them. But he had
no Imaginative ideas of death. His one
thought was of the unsuspecting girl
sitting In the lonely coach, and he hur
riedly dragged the bodies further into
the bushes. In doing this he discovered
a loaded revolver and a flask of
spirits, which had been lying under them,
and promptly secured them. A few
paces away lay the coveted trunk of
arms and ammunition. their , lids
wrenched off and their contents gone
He noticed with a grim smile that his
qwn trunk of samples had shared a like
fate, but was delighted to find that,
while the brighter trifles hatl attracted
the Indians' childish cupidity, they had
overlooked a heavy black merino shawl :
of a cheap but serviceable quality it
would help to protect Miss Cantlro ffpm

rising over the chill and stark plain. It
also occurred, to him that she would
need water after her parched â¢_, Journey,

ing rewarded at last by a trickling^ rill

She brightened considerably with the
coach lamp which he lit and brought in

iously. His face was slightly flushed and
his eyes very bright and keen-looking.
Man killing, except with old professional
hands, has the disadvantage of affecting
the circulation. But Miss Cantlre. had
noticed that the' flask smelt of whisky.
The poor man had probably fortified him
self/from the fatigues of the day.
."I suppose you are getting bored by
this delay," she said tentatively.
"Not at all," he replied. "Would you
like .to play cards? I've got a pack in
my .pocket. We can use the middle seat
as a table, and hang the lantern by the
window strap." â¢
They played euchre, at which Miss Can
tire cheated adorably, and Mr. Boyle lost
game after game shamelessly. Then once
or twice Miss Cantire was fain to put her
cards to her mouth t to conceal an apolo
getic yawn, and her blue-veined eyelids
grew heavy. Whereupon Mr. Boyle sug
gested that she should make herself com
fortable in the corner of the coach with
as many cushions as she liked and the de
spised shawl, while he took the night air
In a prowl around the coach and a look
out for the returning party. Doing so, he
was delighted, after a turn or two, to find
her asleep, and so returned "contentedly
.to his sentry round.
'He 'was some distance from the coach

human and more terrifying, came from

door flew open and Miss Cantlre [ came
rushing toward him. Her face was color

slim figure trembled convulsively as she
frantically caught at the lapels qf his
coat, as If to hide herself within Its folds,
and gasped breathlessly;
'.â¢What Is It? Oh, Mr. Boyle, save me!"
" : "They are wolves,'' he said hurriedly.
"But there Is no darfer; they would nev

were; let me lead you back."
.But she remained rooted to the spot,
still clinging desperately to his coat. "No,

awful cry in "my Â¦ sleep. Ah! What's
that?" and "she. again lapsed in nervous

promptly, firmly, masterfully. She seemed
to .feel the implied protection and yielded
to it gratefully, with the further break
down of a sob. "There .Is no danger." he
repeated cheerfully! "Lean on me," he
contlned, as her step tottered; "you will
â¢ be better In the coach."
"And .you won't leave, me alone
again?V she said in hesitating terror.
."No!" '
He supported her to the coach gravely,
gentlyâ her master and still more his own
âfor all that her beautiful loosened hair
was' against his cheek and shoulder, its
perfume In hla nostrils, and the contour
of her lithe and perfect figure against his
own. He helped her, back Into the coach
âwith the "aid of the cushions and shawl

"Tou see, I don't understand Indiana as

"Well, you take my vrord and Foster's

children are; but th*>y know their masters

Even then they only steal what they

Boyle did not think It necessary to pro

"I've a mind." ebe vrent on slyly, "to

wouldn't have taken (hat precaution."
"Oh. It wasn't for me." said the young
girl, quickly.

"And they were In this coach?" repeat

"Were? They are!" said Miss Can

"Then the sooner I get back to your

with a laugh. "Does Fester know It?"
"Of course not! Do you suppose I'd
tell It to anybody but a stranger to the
place? Perhaps, like you, I know when
end to whom to impart information," she
eaid. mischievously.
They walked on for some moments In
silence. The ascent was comparatively
easy but devious, and Boyle could see
that this new detour would take them
still some time to reach the summit. Miss
Cantire at last voiced the thought in his
own raind. "I wonder what Induced them
to turn off here. And if you hadn't been
so clever as to discover their tracks, how
could we have found them? But." she
added, with feminine logic, "that, of
course, is why they fired those shots."
Boyle remembered that the Bhots came
# from another direction, but did not cor
rect her conclusion. Nevertheless, he
said lightly, "Perhaps even Foster might
have had an Indian scare."
"He ought to know 'friendlies' or 'Gov
ernment reservation men' better by this
time,' Eaid Miss Cantire; 'however,' there
Is something in that. Do you know." sha
added with a laugh, "though I haven't
your keen eyes, I'm gifted' with a keen
scent, and once or twice I've thought I
smelt Indians; that peculiar odor of their
camps, which is unlike anything else, and
which one detects even in their ponies. I
used to notice It when I rode one; no
amount of grooming could take it away."
"I don't suppose that the intensity or
degree of this odor would give you any
Idea cf the hostile or friendly feelings
of the Indians toward you?" asked
Boyle grimly.
Miss Cartire deigned to receive this
Â¦with a smile, at which Boyle, who was
a llttie relieved by their security bo far.
and their nearness to their Journey's end.
developed further ingenious triflling until,
at the end of an hour, they stood upon
the plain again.'
There was no sign of the coach, but its
fresh track was visible leading along the
bank of the ravine toward the intersec
tion of the road they should have come
by, and to which the coach had indubita
bly returned. Boyle drew a long breath.
They were comparatively safe from any
Invisible attack now. At the end of ten
minutes. Miss Cantire, from her superior
height, detected the top of the missing
vehicle- appearing above the stunted bush
es at the Junction of the highway.
"Would you xnlnd throwing those old
flowers away now?" she said, glancing at
the gpolls which Boyle still carried.
**Why?" he asked.
"Oh. they're too ridiculous. Please do."
"May I keep one?" he asked, with the
first Intonation of masculine weakness in
Ills voice. _â¢
"If you like," she said, a little coldly.
Boyle selected a small spray of myrtle

aside.
"Dear me, how ridiculous!" she said.
"What is ridiculous V he asked, lifting
his eyes to hers with a slight color. But
he saw that she was training her eyes in
the distance.
"Why, there doesn't seem to be any
horses to the coach!" ; Â«":

vacant, abandonedâ Its dropped pole, and
cut traces, showing too plainly the fear

behind him made him turn. It was Miss

cocked weapon Ip her hand. "How fool
ish of youâ without a weapon," she gasp

Then they both stared at the coach, the
empty plain end at each other! After
their tedious ascent, their long detour,
their protracted expectancy and their
eager curiosity, there was such a sug
gestion of hideous mockery In this va
cant, useless vehicleâ apparently left to
them in what seemed their, utter, aban

bringing, back the horizon and day, when
he,: woke from hl3 dream with a Â»!gn and
then a laugh. Then he listened for the

to a halt at some . distance from tha

pretty rough nightâ what with her fa
tigue, and her alarm at the wolves â and t
thought it beat to keep the truth from her
as lonp as possible, and I would advise
you to break It to her irently." He then
briefly told thÂ© story of their experiences,
omitting only his own personal encounter
with the Indian. A new pride, which was
perhaps the result of his vigil, prevented
him. * .. >.o;
The young officer glanced at him with
ns much courtesy. as might be afforded
to a civilian Intruding upon active mili
tary operations. "I am sure Major Can
tlre will be preatly obllsed to you when
he knows It." he said politely, "and as
tvÂ«Â» intend to harness up and take tha
conch back to Sago Brush Station lrame
Â«li?itcly you will have an opportunity of
telling him."
"I am not'goinc brick by th^ coach to
Sa?e Brush." said Doyle quietly. "I have
already lost twelve hours of my timeâ
us well 'as my trunkâ on this picnic, and
1 reckon the least Major Cantlre can do
1* to let me take one of your horses to
the next station In time to catch tha
down coach. 1 can do It. If I set out at
vnce."
Boyle heard h!s name, with the famil
iar prefix of "Dicky." ptvenÂ»to the officer
by a commissary sergeant, whom he rec
ognized as having met at the agency, and
the words "Chicago drummer" addÂ«l v
while a perceptible smile went through
out tha group. "Very well, sir." said the
officer, with a familiarity a shade less
respectful than his previous formal man
ner, "you can take the horse, as I be
lieve the Indians have already mads freÂ©
with your samples. Give him a mount,
sergeant." . _-/ e ,>
The two men walked toward the coach.
Boyle lingered a moment at the window
to show him the figure of ,Mlss Cantlre
ntill peacefully slumbering among her
pile of cushions, and then turned quietly
away. A moment later he was galloping
on one of the trooper's horses across tho
empty plain. â¢
â¢ â¢Â¦â¢.â¢ â¢ * â¢ ? â¢-
Miss Cantlre awoke presently to the
sound of a familiar voice and the sight
of figures that she knew. But the young
officer's first words of explanationâa
guarded account of the pursuit of the
Indians and the recapture of the arms,
suppressing the killing of Foster and thÂ«
mail agent â brought a change ' to her
brightened face and a wrinkle to her
pretty brow. "But Mr. Boyle said noth
ing of this to me," she asked, sitting up.
"Where is he?"
"Already on his way to the next station
on one of our horses! Wanted to catch
the down stage and get a new box of
samples, I fancy, as the braves had
rigged themselves out with his laces and
ribbons. Said he'd lost time enough on
this picnic." returned the young officer.
with a laugh. "Smart business chap; but
I hope I don't bore you."
Miss Cantlre felt her cheek flush, and
bit her lip. "I found him most kind and
considerate, Mr. Ashford," she said cold
ly. "He may have thought the escort
could have Joined the coach a little earlier
and saved all this, but he was too much
of a gentleman to say anything about it
to me." she added dryly, with a slight ele
vation of her aquiline nose.
Nevertheless, Boyle's words, as reported
by the young officer, stung her deeply. To
hurry off, too, without saying "good-by"
or even asking bow she slept. No doubt
he bad lost time and was tired of her
company, and thought more of his pre
cious samples than of her! After all, it
was like him to rush off for an order.
Sha was half-Inclined to call the young
officer back and tell him how Boyle had
criticized her costume on the road. But
Mr. Ashford was at that time entirely
preoccupied with his men around a ledge
of rock and bushes some yards from tha
coach, yet not so far away but that she
could hear what the sergeant was saying.
"I'll swear there was no dead Injln here
when we came yesterday I We searched
the whole place, by daylight, too, for any
sign. The In Jin was killed In his track*,
by some one last night. It's Ilka Dick
Boyle, lieutenant, -to have done It, and
like him to have said nothln' to frighten
the young lady. He knows when to keep
his mouth shutâ and when to open It!"
Miss Cantlre sank back In her corner as
the officer turned and approached the
coach. The incident of the past night
flashed back upon herâ Mr. Boyle's long
absence, his flushed face, twisted necktl*
and enfqrced cheerfulness. She was
shocked, amazed, discomfitedâ and admir
ing! And this hero bad been sitting oppo
site to her. silent all the rest of the night.
"Did Mr. Boyle say anything of an
Indian attack last night?" asked Ash
ford. "Did you hear anything?"
"Only the wolves howling," said Miss
Cantlre. "Mr. Boyle was away twice."
She was strangely reticentâ in compli
mentary Imitation of her missing hero.
"There is a dead Indian here- who has
been killed," began Ashford.
"Oh. please don't say anything more,
Mr. Ashford," Interrupted tha young
lady, "but let us get away from this hor
rid place at once. Do get the horses In.
I can't stand it."
But the horses were already harnessed
and .mounted, postilion- wise, by the
troopers. - Tha vehicle was ready to
start when Miss Cantlre called "Stop!"
When Ashford presented himself at
the door the young lady was upon her
hands and knees, searching the bottom
of the coach. "Oh, deart I've lost some
thing. I must have dropped It on the
road," she said, breathlessly, with pink
cheeks. "You must positively wait and
let mo go back and ,'. i It. I won't ba
long. You know there's 'no hurry.' "
Mr. Ashford stared as Mfss Cantir*
skipped like a schoolgirl from the coach
and ran down the trail by which she and
Boyle had approached the coach the night
before. She had not gone far before aha"
came upon the withered flowers he had
thrown away at her command. "It mtut
be about here," she murmured. Sudden
ly she uttered a cry of delight and picked
up the business card that Boyle , had
shown her. Then she looked - furtively
around her, and, selecting a sprig of myr
tle among the cast-off flowers, concealed
It in her mantle and ran back, glowing,
to the coach. "Thank you! All right,
I've found It." she called to Ashford with
a dazzling smile and. leaped Inside.
The coach drove on, and Miss CantlrÂ«
alone In Us' recesses drew tha myrtla
from her mantle and folding it carefully
In her handkerchief, placed It In her reti
cule. Then, sh* drew oat the card, read
Ita dryly practical information over and
over again, examined tha soiled edges,
brushed them daintily, and held It for
a moment, with eyes that saw not, mo
tionless In . her hand. Then she raised
It slowly to her lips, rolled It Into a
spiral, ' and, loosening a hook and eye.
thrust It gently into her bosom.
And Dick Boyle, galloping away to â¢
the distant station, did not know that,
the first step toward a realization of hi*
foolish dream had been taken,

have remained to be hung. But they t
don't: They abooses Silver Phil a heap; _

se'f ain't about none; bein' on some dooty i
over to Tucson. Silver Phil is upstairs on 1
the top floor of the 'doby with his gyarda. 1

" 'You be, be you!' replies Silver Phll r
his eyes burnin* with rage. 'Which you
better look out a whole lot; you-all may

"The''gyard laughs, ugly an*, exaspera
tln' and then puts the 10-gauge in a lock
er along with two, or three Winchesters.
Then he turns the key on said firearms
an' goes caperln' off to his feed.
"The other gyard, his compadre, la set
tin' on a stool lookln' outen a window.
Mebby he's thinkln* of his sins. It would
be more in his hand at this epock if he
. thinks of Silver PhiL
"Silver Phil, who's full of wrath an' rage
at . the taunts of that departed gyard,
slips his hands free of the irons. ,Most of
the hide on his hands comes with 'em,
but Silver Pbll don't care. The gyard's
back Is to him where he slta gazln* out
an' off along the dusty trail, where it
winds gray an* hot toward Tucson. Silver
Phil organizes, stealthy an' cat-cautloua;
he's out for the gyard's gun where it
hangs from his belt, the butt all temptin'"
an! su'gestive.
"As Silver Phil makes his first move,
.them laig-locks clanks a little. It ain't
louder than the jingle of two centouse
knockin* together. It's enough, however;
it strikes on the y' ear of that thoughtful
gyard like the roar of a '44. Which he
emerges from that reverie with a start;
the play comes cl'ar as noonday .to him
in a moment.
"The gyard leaps without even lookin'
round, to free himse'f from Silver. Phil.
Which he's the splinter of a second too
late. Silver Phil makes a spring like a
mountain lion, laig-locks an', all, an'
grabs the gun. As the gyard goes clat
terin' downstairs. Silver PhU pumps two
loads into him an" curls him up at the
foot. Then Silver. Phil hurls the six- '
shooter at him, accompanied with a vol
ley of mal'dlctlons.
"Without pausln' a moment. Silver Phil
grabs the stool an' smashes to flinders
that locker that holds the 10-gauge Green
er. He j\ln't forgot none; an' he's plumb
locoed to get eald partic'lar weepon for
the other gyard. He rips It from the rack,
an* shows at the window Jest as his prey.
, comes runnin' to the rescoo of his pard:
" 'Oh, you I Virg Sanders!' yells Silver
Thil. .
"The second syard looks up; an' as he
does, Silver Phil gives him both bar'ls.
Forty-two buckshot;! an' that gyard's so
clost he stops 'era all! As he lays dead,

an' throws, one after the other, stock an'

forth to capture Silver Phil on this yere

what follows, I never experiences no

that them thrillin* episodes wherein this
Silver Phil flggers sort o* corrodes at
his intellects ontil he's absolutely locoed.

Faro Nell who detects him in them hoss
ha'r frauds that time.
"Which the first news Wolfville has of
Silver Phil, after that escape, is one
evenin' about fifth drink time, or, as
you-all says, 'four o'clock." The sun's
still hot an' high over the west. Thar's
no game goin' ; but bein' as it's aa con
venient thar as elsewhere, Cherokee's
settin' back of hia box with Faro Nell on

is over across In the dance hall door; an*
as it befalls, his pet best bronco, is

" "Which I wouldn't dishonor them suns

jj ances of the Southwest, wherein
J haste is a feacber an' brev-ty the
bull's eye aimed at, said cogno
men gets shortened up to 'Silver Phil.'
The Old Cattleman looked thoughtfully
into his glass as if by that method he col
lected the scattered elements of a story.
There was a pause. Then he lifted the
glass to his lips as one who being now
evenly equipped with information, also
proposed that it arrive hand in hand with
that Inspiration which would build a tale
from it.
"Shore, this Silver Phil }s dead now; an'
I never yet crosses up with the gent
who's that soopernuous as to express
regrets. It's Dan Boggs who dismisses
Silver Phil ; Dan does it in efforts he puts
forth to faithfully represent the right.
"Doc Peets allers allows this yere Sil
ver Phil is a 'degen'rate'; leastwise that's
the word Peets uses. An* while I freely
concedes I ain't none too cl'ar as to ju^t
what a degen'rate is, I stands ready to
back Peets' description to win. Peets Is, .
b'ar Colonel WliUam Greene Sterett, the
best eddicated sharp in Arizona; also the
wariest as to expressln' views. Tharfore
when Pccts puts it up, onflinchin*. that
this yere Silver Phil's a degen'rate, you- ,.
all can spread your blankets an' go to
sleep on it, that a degen'rate he is.
"Silver Phil is a little, dark, ignorant,
tousied ha'red party, none too neat in
costume. He's as black an' small an'
evil-sctmin' as a Mexican; still, you sees
at a Rlar.ce he ain't no Greaser neither.
An* with all this yere surface wicked
ness. Silver Phil has a quick, hyster'cal
way with him like a v.-oman or a bird;
an' thar's ever a grin on his face. With
It all. you can smell 'bad* on Silver Phil,
an' folks who's on the levelâ an' most
folks isâ nacherally conceives a notion
a'gin him the moment him an' they
meets up.
"The first time I sees Silver Phil he's
walkin' down the licker room of the Red
Light. As he goes by the bar Black Jack
âwho's rearrangin' the nose paint on tho
shelf so it shows to advantageâ gets care
less an' drops a bottle.
" 'Crash!' it goes to the floor.
"With the sound, an' the onexpected
suddenness of it stampin' his nerves, that
a-way. Silver Phil leaps into the air like
a cat; an' when he 'lights, he's frontin"
Black Jack an' a gun in each hand.
" 'Which I won't be took!' says Silver
Phil, all flustered.
"His eyes is gleamin' an' his face Is
palin* an' his ugly grin gets even wider
than before. But like a flash, he sees
thar's nothin' to go in the air aboutâ
nothin' that means him ; an* he quick puts
up his hardware an' composes himse'f.
" 'You-all conducts yourse'f like a sport
who has something on his mind,* says
Texas Thompson, who's thar present at 1
the time an' can't refrain from com
mentin' some on the awful start that bot
tle smashin' gives Silver Phil.
"This Silver Phil makes no response, but
sort o' grins plenty ghastly, while ' h5s
breath comes quick. Still, while you-all
notes easy that this person's scared, it's
plain he's a killer jest the same. It's fre
quent that a-way. I'm never much afraid
of cr.e of them cold game gents like Cher
okee Hall; you can gamble the limit
they'll never put a six-shooter in play
till it's shorely come their turn. But timid,
feverish locoed people, who's jedgment is
had an' who's prone to feel themse'fs in
peril: they're the kind who kills. For
myse'f. I shuns all such. I won't say
them erratic, quick-to-kill .sports don't
have courage; only it strikes meâ an' I've
rode up on a heap of 'emâ it's more like
a fear-bit f'roclty that a-way than sand.
"Take Enright or Peets or Cherokee or
Tutt or Jack Moore or Boggs or Texas
Thompson; you're plumb safe with them
gents, all or any. An* yet thar ain't the
first glimmer of bein' gun-shy about ono
of 'em; they're as clean strain as the eter
nal granite, an' no more likely to hide
out from danger than a hill. An' while
they differs from each other, yet -they're
all different from sech folks as Silver
Phil. Boggs, goln' to war, is full of a
rood-humored integrity; gala an' confi
dent; ready to start or stop like a good
hoss. Cherokee Hall is quiet an' word
less; he gets pale, but quick an' deadly;
en* his notion, nacheraL Is to fight for a
finish. Peets is haughty an' eooperlor on
them few o'casions when he onbends in
battle an' comports himse'f like a gent
who fights down hill; the same, ondoubt
ed, bein' doo to them book advantages of
Peets which elevates him an' lifts him
above the common herd a whole lot. Ea
right, who's oldest, is, of course, slowest
to embark In blood; an' pulls his weepon*
âwhen he does pull 'emâ with a air of sor
rowful resignation. / â¢ ",,* .
" â¢Which I'm shorely saddest when I
shoots,' says Enrlght to me, as he re
loads his gun one time.
"These yere hoomane sentiments, how
ever, don't deter him none from shootin'
<juick-an' aimin' low, which latter habit
makes Wolfville's honored chief a highly
desp'rate game to get ag'inst.
"Jack Moore, bein* as I explains former,
the execyootif of the Stranglers an* re
sponsible for law an* order, has a heap of
shootin' shoved onto him from time to
time. Jack transacts these yere fireworks
allers with a ca'm. offlshul front, the
same bein' devoid, equal of anger or re
gretsi Tutt, partic'lar after he weds Tuc-
Bon Jennie, an' more jartic'lar still when
he reaps new honors as the originator of
that blessed Infant Knright Peets Tutt,
carries on what shootin' comes his way
in a manner a lot dignified an' lofty; while
morbid about his wife demandin" she be
divorced that timeâ although he picks up
his hand In a fracas sharp an' Irritable
an* with no delays, after, all is that well
balanced he's bound to be each time
plumb right.
"Which, you observes, son, from these
yere settln's forth, that thar's a â¢ mighty

I'm confident Jack would have cut in that

his offlshul system. Jack more'n . once

"It's not only my beliefs, but likewise
the opinions .of sech Joodiclal sports as
Enrlght, Peets an* Colonel Sterett, that

none if he's a pure rustler that a-way;
as ready to stand up a stage. as snake a

down on the Wolfville intell'gence on^the
heels of a vlcissitoode or two wherein
Dan Boggs performs, an' which gets

the sperlt to face no sech flash-light war
rior, he acts on Cherokee's hint to vamos,
an' fades Into the street. Shore, Cherokee
don't cash that felon's. chips none. He
confiscates 'em. Cherokee ain't quite so
tenderly romantic aa to make good to a
detected robber. Moreover, he lets this
Silver Phil go onhartned, when by every
roole hit ikelp is forfeit. It turns out
rood for the camp, however, as this yere
experience proves so depressln' to Silver
Phil ho removes his blankets to Red Dog.
Thar among them purblind tarrapins, its
inhabitants, it's likely he gets prosperous
an' endetected action on that little old
ha'r copper of his. .
"Silver Phil don't say nothin' In retort.
He's aware by the lib'ral way Cherokee
sep'rates himse'f from the bowie that said
weepon don't constitoote Cherokee's entire
"Thar's a picture paper pasted onto the
wooden wall of the Bed Light, displaym'
tSe liniaments of some party. That bowie
pierces the pictureâ a shot in the cross It
isâ an' all with sech force 'that the p'int
of the blade shows a inch an' a half on
the other side of that indivldyooal board.
" 'The next time I throws a knife in
your presence,' remarked Cherokee to
Silver Phil, an* Cherokee's as cold an'
p'isonous as a rattlesnake, 'it'll, be
la'nehed at you.'
" 'Chuck!'
" 'That's a- yconique invention!' ob
serves Cherokee, an' he's sarcastic a
whole lot while he menaces with the
bowie at Silver Phil; 'that contraption is
shcrely plenty sagacious! But it den't
go here. Shove in your chips.* Silver
Phil oneys; an' he shows furtif, ugly an'
alarmed all at once. He don't say a
word. 'Now pull your freight,' concludes
Cherokee. If you ever comes within ten
foot of a game of mine ag'in, I'll throw
this knife plumb through you â through
ar/ through.' An' Cherokee, by way of
'lustration an' emphasis, lets fly the knife
across the bar room. It comes like a
Hash.
Â¦ "Cherokee gets posted quick an' with
one look. As sharp as winkin' Cherokee
Â¦has a nine-inch bowie in his hand, an*
with one slash, cuts the hoss-ha'r ciost
up. by Silver Phil's belt.
"Silver Phil wins three or four bets;
it's Nell that catches on to his racket an'
sfgns-up to Cherokee onder the table
with her little foot. One glance an' Cher
okee is loaded with information. This
Silver Phil, it seems, in a spirit of avar
ice, equips himse'f with a copperâ little
wooden checker is what this yere copper
isâ one he's done filched fro^i Cherokee
the day prior. He's fastened a Ions black
hoss-ha'r to it, an' he ties the other end
of the hoss-ha'r to his belt in front. This
ha'r is jest long enough as' he's planted
at the table that a- way so it reaches nice
to them four nearest kyardsâ the king,
queen, jack, ten. An' said ha'r is plumb
invisible except to eyes as sharp as Faro
Nell's. The deceetful Silver Phil will
have a stack on one of 'em, coppered
with this yere ha'r copper. He waiches
the box. As the turns is made, if his
kyard comes his way, well an' good. Sil
ver Phil does nothin'; but garners. in re
sults. When his kyard starts to show
ag'in him, however, that's different. In
seen events. Silver Phil draws in his
breath, sort o' takin' in on th3 hoss-ha'r
that a-way, an' the copper comes off the
bet. When the turn is made, thar's Sil
ver Phil's betâ by virchoo of said fraudâ ;
open an' triumphant, an' waitin' to be

"While Mexico has a wealth of docu
mentary remains Central America Iack3
these to a great extent but abounds in
monuments whose hieroglyphics vary de
cidedly from those in Mexico and have
not as yet been fully identified. Indeed
the relics that remain of both the Aztecs
and the Incas are so few and so valuable
that people in Mexico have begun to
manufacture numerous frauds In imita
tion of the fine feather work and the
ancient codices that are known to be
authentic. This is going to make further
'exploration and research a matter of
great difficulty for those not exceptional
ly well versed In Mexican lore.
"The famous Calendar stone dug up in
the City of Mexico in 1790 has, however,
been of great importance in reading the
hieroglyphics that are authentic."
In this connection it is interesting to
know that one of Mrs. Nuttan's greatest
discoveries and the most important to tho
science of American archaelogy might
be called a discovery in the sky. it con
sists in the recognition by her that the
constellation of the Great Bear in connec
tion with the polar star, or dipper, which
is so familiar to every one in this coun
try, was the constellation which regu
lated nearly all the religious ceremonies
and calendar systems ... of the. various
American tribes.
This furnished the first* key to the re
remarkable series of symbols which havo
so puzzled the archaeologist because of
their resemblance to the symbols which
were known to all the ancient peoples of
Asia, Northern Africa and even Europe.
'These symbols have been found In ' the
shell and copper ornaments contained in
the mounds, they, have been traced out
in the carved and engraved, stones 1 in
Central America, have been recognized In
the myths and symbols of the northwest
coast, and have been regarded as an evi
dence of contact between the continent
and the Asiatic peoples and a.transmis
sion to this continent by some - unknown
channels. \ . , , Â¦ . .
The discovery was made by Mrs. Nut-
."Under such circumstances It : la "ap
parent how the American continent could
have become an isolated area of preserva
tion where primitive forms of .civilization,
religious . cult,' symbolism: and Industries,
drawn at" different 'epoch's 'from'- various
"Considering that It would be premature
to formulate a final "conclusion on a sub- â¢
ject which demands so much more inves
tigation, I merely observe that, as far as
I can see, the conditions which existed
and survive among the aborigines of
America would be fully, accounted fdr by
the assumption that they received certain
elements of culture and civilization from
Mediterranean seafarers who, at widely
separated, critical, periods of Old World
history, may have transported refugees
and would-be colonists or founders' of
ideal republics and ,'divine polities' to dif
ferent parts of the hidden or divine land
of 'the west,' the existence of which was
known by tradition to the Egyptian priest
hood. -; . '., Â¦ Â¦ â .. . , ' . : . . ' .
This fact has given rise to much con
troversy as to the origin, of the Aztecs
and the Incas. Some writers advance
much evidence to show that the ancestors
of the Aztecs were really Mongols, who
crossed from China at the Bering Sea,
centuries ago, and swept down through/
the valleys' of North America until they
settled in Mexico. Other writers have
found stronger proof that they came from
Egypt. On this point Mrs. Nuttall has
written: ,
The discovery has brought the nations
of the earth close tog-ether and shows that
the present condition in which we find
ourselves was anticipated thousands of
years ago, even by rude people and those
who had no means of studying the heav
ens except with their naked j eye. Every
separate tribe and nation had its own sys
tem of astrology and religious symbolism,
but there was the same common basis.
tall while studying the calendar system
of Mexico and Central America, and was
really the result of that study, the posi
tion of the constellation in the heavens at
the different periods which marked , the
seasons and the solstices making in the
course of the year the very figure which
has been taken as a symbol by all the na
tions of the earth, or at least by those
who -were so situated as , to be familiar
with the northern sky, the figure called
the Suastlka.
All this is strange work for a woman,
though Mrs. Nuttall j says that Mexican
exploration has interested her since early
girlhood. To her it is a fascinating study
offering infinite , possibilities.^ for the old
ruins of these ancient people may still
contain the most startling evidence of the
development of the whole 'American con
tinent through , long ages.
Mrs. Nuttall has already found the key
to many . things that were thought im-
* Â¦ ' Â¦
more or less important centers or from
the outposts of the Old 'World, would have
been handed down transformed through
the active and Increasing Influence of the
natlvo element.
"The latter must always have been
markedly predominant since it must be
assumed if at all that the number of in
dividuals who reached America and the
subsequent duration of their lives must
have been extremely limited.
"What is more, as Montezuma related
that- the colonists, from whom he de
scended, married native women, it Is ob
vious that from \ the outset foreign and
native influences were Â¦combined."

finally found It In England. It completes
all the Aztec relics extant of which there

coming visit to Mexico.
One of the manuscripts mentioned in the
Cortez inventory of the gifts he sent to
the King of Spain was in the
Imperial Library in Florence. Of
the other, and the most Impor
tant of the two. absolutely no clew
could be obtained for years, though Mrs.
Nuttall brought to light ancient Mexican
shields, feather headdresses of the time
of Montezuma, numerous relics of the
Atlatl spear throwers, which had long
been cast aside as worthless, and two
very valuable codices which had been lost
for centuries, and of which she has since
contributed a lengthy treatise to the Pea
body Museum. She learned all there was
to be learned from the relics she found
and identified in Europe, and wrote many
scientific volumes on the subject, but
there was still much to be extracted from
the missing Cortez manuscript.
The outlook was discouraging in the
extreme. To have to leave Mexico in
order to study Mexico was a curious
anomaly. But as the missing relics were
absolutely necessary to the broader re
searches ehe had planned there was noth
ing for it but to find them. Without
them the history and the origin of the
Aztecs must remain a mystery. To find
them meant, perhaps, nothing more than
fragmentary hints of the life and cus
toms of this mighty pe6ple, who had built
great temples, massive forts and huge
pyramids rivaling in size and impressive
grandeur even the famed â¢ pyramids of
Egypt; but nevertheless, she went Im
mediately to Europe and began a system
atic search of every library on the Conti
nent.
She learned, after months of investiga
tion, that the re!ics that had not been
sent by the all-conquering Cortez to his
Â¦King: in Spain, 400 years ago, when with
a mere handful of soldiers he had sub
jugated the whole Aztec nation, num
bering millions, had been scattered to the
four quarters of the globe, and no reli
able record kept of them.
It Is over thirteen years since she first
went there to decipher the mysterious
hieroglyphics engraved on leathern parch
ments by the Aztecs, and supposed to be
carefully filed away in the museums in
the City of Mexico. But there were none
left to be deciphered. They had disap

whose history they were believed to hold
concealed i:i their curious symbols.

him as the most treacherous and
brutal of any of his red-skinned brethren,
Is to be given a chance to live like a land
owner. Whether* he will elect to do an
remains to be Been.
There are undoubtedly many people,
who, in view of his past murderous rec
ord, will say that he cannot do bo. But
after talking about It for some years
Uncle Bam has decided to give the Indian
who used to boast that he killed Mexican
soldiers with rocks, having "no ammuni
tion to waste upon Mexicans," a chance
to spend the days of bis old age upon a
ranch of his own. With this end In view
General Frank Armstrong, as an agent
of the War Department, has been recently
at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, making arrange-"-,
ments for the release of the old chief and
the 236 Apaches who have been held for
the past twelve years by the Government
as prisoners of war. These Indians will be
scattered and allotted lands near some
of the Government reservations where
they may raise crops.'
This chief of the-, worst, wildest and
strongest of the ' tribes j of the Apaches,
chased for years by the Injured . white
man, has behaved himself well during the
tmrny years that he has been confined In
the military prisons of Alabama and Flor
ida. In this he has set a good example
to the band of followers who shared his
captivity.
But for the past five years he has en
joyed a life that Is freedom Itself as com
pared with the routine of a prison. It is
about that length of time since Geronimo
and the Apaches with him were brought
from Florida to Fort Sill on account of
the bad effects of the extreme Southern
climate. The Dry Tortugas. where they
were first 6ent. dealt eo disastrously with
their physical well being that it was
feared they would all die. When they
arrived at Fort Sill they were put under
military guard and kept under that es
pionage for a long time.
Then many of them were made scouts,
and are, with their chief Geronlmo, still
on duty In that capacity. They live near
the post, and In pretty good houses, but
they still have to report at headquarters.
Geronlmo himself, who is now more than
(5 years old, has a nice house and is liv
ing there contentedly with his family,
which numbers 6everal grown children.
His natural shrewdness has Increased,
and he Is fast making the ways of the
â¢white man his own. He Is an inveterate
gambler as he always has been, and is not
a poor Indian, being worth probably $8000
or $9000, much of It made by gambling.
Next to gaming he loves firewater, or in
plain English, whisky; and he would
rather be a party to a horse trade than
eat. He is still active and rides his horse
with the youngest of the bucks. He took
a trip to the Omaha Exposition two years
"ago and enjoyed It hugely. â¢
It Is not yet settled where he may plant
his own vine and fig tree, but it will prob
ably not be near the scene of his former
depredations. It is said that the word
Apache indicates the "superior man."
In the case of the Chiricahuas and their
troublesome chief it meant a superiority
In strength, endurance, activity, and last
but not least, cruelty.
Geronlmo Is not a full-blooded Apache,
though possessing all their attributes of
shrewdness, bloodthirstiness and treach
ery, coupled with dash and daring on the
warpath. There is a tradition among the
Apaches that his father was a wealthy
Mexican rancher and that he was stolen
by his tribe when the Apaches were on a
raid into old Mexico.
It would be Interesting to look through
the annals of his Indian brain during the
long years of his Imprisonment Perhaps
his mental activity has been much like
that of the tiger at the Zoo, never still,
and always suggesting to the outsider
what he would be if he ever escaped to
his mountain and desert haunts again.
So that even if age has claimed Geronimo
acres of ranch land may at least be Â¦wel
come to his savage mentality, as a prom- --
ise of an existence that will at least
bring him nearer to the old free life of
hie younger days. Geronimo first cama N

each of these stations an operator was on
duty as long as the sun shone. Miles kept
his troops hidden, but they were warned 1

part of the hostlles within one or two
hours. One station Bent 830,000 words dor

bearings the news that Geronlmo had sur
rendered. That surrender took place in
the middle of thÂ© month of August, 1886,
on the San Bernardino ranch. Just on the
line between Arizona and Mexico.
One of the officers whom Miles selected
to continue tho pursuit when the Indians
should retreat south of the Mexican
boundary was Captain H. W. Lawton,
afterward thÂ© General Lawton who met
death In the Philippines. On July 13, 18S8,
a surprise of the camp of Geronimo and
Natchez was effected which eventually led
to their surrender and resulted in the Im
mediate capture of everything In their
camps except themselves and the clothes
they wore. In thÂ© meantime the Apaches
had been keeping up their atrocities at a
rate without precedent. ThÂ© case of the
Peck family may be mentioned as one of
the most horrible. The entire family was
captured by the Indians and several of
the farmhands were killed. The husband
was tied up and compelled to witness in
describable tortures inflicted upon his wife
until she died. "
The terrible ordeal rendered him tem
porarily Insane, and this condition saved
his life, for the Apaches, having great
awe of an insane person, set him free.
All this time the troops against Geron-*
lmo were as 100 to 1. It was only thosfA
nearest to him at any moment that bd\
needed to fear. Every spring or Water
hole in Arizona .was guarded by from fif
teen to twenty men from the United
States Fourth Cavalry. Geronimo put his
women and children in a secret strong
hold In the mountains, and then with his
warriors he traveled at night over the
ridges of the mountains. In many cases
the troops would come upon the deserted
camps of the Indians with the campfires
still burning, showing how recently tho
savages had left.
At length combined forces drove th#
Apaches Into Sonora. and ther* Lawton
rave them little rest. In the meantime
Lieutenant Gatewood of thÂ© Sixth Cav
alry, now dead, was sent with two In
dians to the hostile camp to discover thÂ»

came into camp and Geronlmo rushed up
and, hugging Lawton, said: "You ara
the man I want to talk with." Finally
they agreed to accompany Lawton to
where they could meet General Mil<s and
formally surrender. Later, after a lengthy
talk -with Miles and after roing- back to
his camp for one night, which practically
gave the troops no control over him but
the confidence they wero obliged to place
in him, Geronlmo, this chief who years
before was regarded by the peasant* in
Chihuahua as "a devil sent to punish
them for their sins/* surrendered uncon
ditionally to General Miles.
On the 8th of September following thÂ«
special train bearing the captured chigt
and his women and warriors steamed out

Into his doubtful prominence in 1876, when
by the death of old Cochlse, the former
head chief, he became easily the leader
of his tribe. Boon after this the munler
of a ranchman named Rogers, because he
refused to eell the Indians all the whisky
they wanted, thoroughly aroused the
whites and they clamored for the removal
of the Chlrlcahuas to the San Carloa
reservation, where the rest of the Apaches
spurs. Their sentinels were mounted and
supplied with good field glasses. . Many
engagements took place beyond the Mex
ican border, and as the Government of
that country would not until some time
later allow the United â¢" States .to estab
lish any permanent camps in their coun
try It complicated the situation. Tha
Apaches did not fear the Mexican sol
diers, and they kept the country In a
state of constant terror.
, They stole horses from Arizona rancnes
while the cowboys were at home and.
knew what was going on, but were airaia
to stir from the hotfses. General Crook
fought Indians with Indlans,\and the dif
ficulties of the desert were overcome in
part by the employment of many ofthG
same Chiricahua^Indlans as scouts.^ They
were physically Inferior . and the greater
part of them of mixed/race, but as war
scouts they were Ideal. "Small of stature
and apparently no match â¢ physically * for
the - white man, yet when it came to
climbing, mountains Â¦ or making, long
marches j they I were swift and tireless.
One of the most famous of these scouts
was "Dutchy," in attendance upon Cap
tain'Emmet Crawford, who met a tragic
deathâ killed by Mexican troops while., do
ing all in his power to .help them.. . HÂ©
was in the Mexican mountains in pursuit
had been placed. Geronlmo was much op-Â«
posed to going. When it was decided to'
remove the Indians he asked for time to
bring in his family, who were scattered
in the mountains. He disappeared and
nothing more was seen of him until long:
afterward, when he was taken In New
Mexico and brought to the Ban - Carlos
reservation.
He escaped soon after that and was out
until 1878, when he was captured in So
nora by Lieutenant Haskell. He vamosed
for the third time in 1881 and was out in
the fastnesses of the mountains that
seemed his natural home until General
Crook brought him back in 1884. Not v a
year after came the outbreak of 1885,
when, fortified by tizwin, Geronimo left
the Apache reservation, and accompanied
by Chihuahua, a sub-chief, and a small
but extremely devilish band of braves,
proceeded to terrorize ', the white man.
under Geronimo's leadership this band
kept some of the best Indian fighters in
the U n i te d States hunting them across the
arid plains and in the mountain fastnesses
of Arizona for more than a year. --
This band of Apaches descended upon
Jlttle settlements and lonely ranches and
ran off the stock and put it to their own
uses, massacred emigrants and pillaged
their trains, stole everything that could
be carried off and killed men,. women and
children who chanced to cross their path.
At last the whites rose up and demanded
that the War Department should wipe
out Geronimo 'and all his band.
General George Crook, onÂ© of the ablest
Indian fighters the army has produced,
was. assigned to the task. He and his
men suffered through a campaign that
was full of. peculiar difficulties. The
horses of the cavalrymen often .broke
down in the midst. of the waterless, tree
less, burning levels of rock-and sand. The
mountain passes, little known to the
whites, were homes to the red men, and

And this brings us to James K. Hack
â¢tt in the "Pride of JennieÂ©/' and KyrlÂ«
BeUew ia "A Gentleman of Franc*." As
sword fighters both men have become the
talk of two continents.
In the fourth act ot his play Bellew
goes to thÂ« rescue of his sweetheart and
Is discovered by a band of ruffian^ who
have her in their keeping.
He stands at the top of a stairway; the
entire cast, with the exception of his lady
love, rush at him. With superb and
miraculous dexterity he picks off one
after another, until finally the stage is
covered with dead bodies. One man falls
head foremost down the long, flight of
ctairs and rolls like a log Into the foot
lights. Bellew escapes without a scratch.
This scene is said to be a most thrilling
and exciting affair, and the wonder Is that
the entire cast is not killed in reality.
Bellfcw explains this by telling the stage
secret that each man wears a coat of mall
under his slashed doublet.
But it was Hackett who first showed
that the up-to-date hero must needs be
able to exterminate a dozen enemies alone
and single-handed. Before he made such
a Dig hit in the "Pride of Jennico." he
had betome famed as a swordsman *""Â¦
thrci'ifti the two duel scenes In "The Pris
oner of Zenda." With his - trusty sword
he even carved out for himself the high
est honors, when as Mercutlo he appeared
with Maude Adams and William ? Faver- -
sham in "Borneo and Juliet" In New Tork
laet year.
In the book by Agnes and Edgerton
Castle. Captain Basil Jennico is a grievous
disappointment as a fighter. 'In' the duel
In London, where he first meets "Eugen,
the villain, the latter disarms him and
runs him through twice, leaving him on
the field for dead. Jenoico finally recov
ers and roes to Dornhelm to seek his wife.
Learning: her true Identity and also that
she still loves him, he abducts her from
the palace. Prince Eugen pursues the
lovers and finally overtakes them. In the
fight that* follows Eugen knocks Jennico's
sword out of his hand at the first clash
and Is about to finish him when Jennlco's
coachman shoots the Prince.

It would never do for any self-respecting

A new chou has been discovered. It Is
called the "star." ' To' make It you; need
the following materials: ': . -
Two yards of double-faced satin ribbon.
Sewing silk, the color of the ribbon.
Half, a yard of millinery wire.
A set of nimble fingers. , .
An artistic eye. -

Watermelon pink, old rose, claret red,
raspberry and wine are good In the
softest tints, not too pronounced. Coffee

worn with anything:. Oatmeal color la a

tone, say blue, or cardinal, or ever emer

Aa the little girl said oflt.'it's u pink

. Perhaps, though, it would be best for a
beginning to select a champagne colored
ribbon, for It: la; ao iure to be a success
when done. Champagne Is that very faint
yellow, almost amber, yet lighter, which
Is now seen In' so many of the new silks,
and adapts Itself better than red.
Beginning the ; Chou. '
Take two yards of satin, panne, liber tx
a little upward above the belt. \ The ends
trail in the back and are finished with
side plaltlngs of white chiffon.
To sweet simplicity have we gone for
the new belt. It Is a sash, soft, heavy,
plain and most girlishly arranged. You
can use it either with the bow in the
back or without and In either case It Is
modish. Take a wide plecs of liberty
satin ribbon, or panne ribbon, and tie It
around the waist Pull the front down
to make a long point and catch It In
place with little pearl pins. The back
can have Its bow if It so please you. The
new bow shows two little perky loops and
two. ends that sweep the floor. This Is the
bow. worn upon a . white gown : of the
bride, Mrs. Chauncey Depew.. The bow
Is located exactly at the back of the belt
and the end's are pulled out and made
to stand erect In chou fashion, pointing
thrown aside when the craze- passes, and
a new gem can be purchased.
And all of this goes to show that the
woman who acts as her own dressmaker
must, indeed, "get busy" If she~ is going
to produce a gown decorated in the latest
manner. Yet the effects which she will
produce are not fussy ones. Much less
elaborate are they .than the extensive
appliques to which she resorted last fall,
but they are more work and, thereby,
she Is the sufferer.
Pearls are the gems of the hour, And
fortunately for her of modest purse ttiey
can be so well imitated '.that the decep
tion Is not apparent The real pearl is a
Jewel of much worth, but the imitation
can be bought for very little and. as It is
often quite aa pretty and answers the
purpose as well, there Is no reason for
not patronizing It Where Jewels are
bought as an Investment for one's money
it Is quite different and the lines of argu
ment change, but, if they are purchased
simply as a decoration, a fashionable ac
cessory of dress, the imitation article is
even better than the real, for It can be

Around the skirt, a little above the

very deep, so arranged that the points
lay one up and one down. To accomplish
this, the trimming had to be twisted,
turned right over so that the big points
turned upward towaro the waist line and
then downward toward the hem of the
Kklrt. In the points were criss-cross
bands of white satin ribbon, set directly

This is a quite new treatment, you will
agree.

as well as documents worth many times
more In the vaults of the other offices,
with his hand on the trusty six-shooter,
only too eager to meet any intruder,
walks old C N. Clark, one of the first
men that rallied to the support of old
John Brown at the time of the border
warfare in Kansas.
Clark,' or as he Is better known to the
employes of the courthouse, "Old John
Brown" Clark, has perhaps few equals.
"With tha record of a dozen bloody battles
â¢while In the English army and as many
more In the Northern army ol the civil
war, during which ha served with tha
rank of captain In the Fifteenth Kansas,
he is a man who has done more than bis
share in mnkiyig history.
But these battles are not what make
Clark famous, j It Is doubtful If there Is
another man now living who was present
â¢when old John Brown discovered bis son's
body riddled with bul'.ots and who heard
the old man as he stood over tho body
with uplifted hands declare vengeance on
the slave States for the death of his. son.
It is here that Clark figured, and at one
time had a reward of $800 offered for his
capture dead or alive. Serving with John
Brown from first to last it was by the
merest chance and good fortune that he
Â¦was not present at the bloody engagement
of Harper's Ferry, when John Brown was
captured and his band slaughtered by a
command under Lieutenant Lee.
Clark is an old man now. Seventy-four
iumners have come and gone. His step Is
not so firm as when he started on his
border warfare. His hearing Is, not so
good. His hand Is not so steady -when"
holding the revolver, but bis nerve is still
there and woe be to a man -who makes an
attempt at robbery on the courthouse of
Spokane County. > The courthouse em
ployes themselves are careful when enter

selves known to this watchman before at

Bora in Ireland at the time when that
country Â¦was attempting to throw off the
yoke of Great Britain, and the island was
being agitated by Daniel O'Connell, the
Irish patriot, he inherited the <J,esire for
freedom. "I have been an Abolitionist,"
he said, "ever since I heard O'Connell
Epeak."
At the early age of 17 he enlisted In the
British army and served three yearsâ first
as color sergeant and later as junior lieu
tenant of grenadiers. He fought under
General Knox In the Sikh war and was
for eleven months through the campaign
in Afghanistan, during which time he saw
Tn'pTiy narrow escapes and fought in places
where men were mowed down as fast as
they charged the enemy. Returning from
the war, whither he went without the
consent of his parents, ha found his
mother had died. Ha sold his commission
In tha British army for Â£765 and started
for Australia, but Instead landed In New
Tork Just about the time the gulf between
the North and South was assuming dan
rerous proportions.
In 1253, or three years after he landed in
America, he found his way to Baltimore,
where ha engaged in missionary work.
Two years later the excitement in Kan
sas and his desire for adventure and ex
citement drew him to the West and he lo
cated In Lawrence. Here he met a man
by tha name of Kreggy, who was the cor
respondent of a New Tork paper, and to
day Clark declares Kreggy was one of
the best men who ever lived.
Mr. Clark never wearies of reciting his
adventures with John Brown, and many
Interesting anecdotes are always In his
mind to please the ready listener.
"Up to the year of lS5t we had never
seen nor heard of John Brown," said the
veteran. "In that year I and Kreggy,
with two other friends, started from Law
rence to Oaawatomle to look over the
country and perhaps find work. On the
morning we reached Osawatomle we heard
that a Southerner named Kline with 150
men was coming to raid Kansas.
"That morning John Brown had told his
son to go to the postofflce for the mall,
expecting to get~a letter from his wife.
Brown himself shouldered an ax and
etarted to cut rails. About 9 o'clock we
heard that Kline was coming on a raid
and was not more than a mile away. We
were then near the Brown house and I
had not yet met John Brown. When we
beard this news you bet vw hid.
"The raiders pxasefi. ab they did so we
heard a lot of shooting in front of Brown's
house and as soon as we thought it safe
started there to see what the trouble
â¢was. We four came around one corner of
the house Just as Brown ' and Sheriff
Williams came around the other corner,
and there near the front door In the path
lay Brown's son stretched on the ground,
riddled with bullets, while in his hand: he
still held the letter from his .mother,
which he had been reading. He had evi
dently been sitting in an old rocking chair
reading when shot to death by the slave
State men.
"I v/ili never forget the lock on old man

"I will tell you of our last deed, 'in 1859.
A . farmer named Krew, living in I Bates

day and - got' the drop on him. . He was
going I. to', fight first, but ;. saw ; we meant
business. We took all of his eleven slaves
and 'started' North. Â¦ We , got i to /Chicago,
where we hid In an old mill. By this time
detectives all over the United States 'were
hunting, for us, and we kept mighty close. ,
"One night we heard a rap* at ; the door.
Old 'Â¦Â¦Â¦ man. Brown answered?,"' and there
stood Allen' Plnkerton, that famous de-
cars to ' take us to Detroit secretly. We
loaned the ' negroes ; on and got -on our
selves, and left Chicago. At Detroit 'old
man Brown says to me, Tou ' take those
slaves into Canada,* get them located and
then coma back. ; We *fo going to Har

I took : the , slaves, got - on a' ferry and
snapped my, fingers at all the detectives
in America and was soon In Canada.
"From that time on we carried on our
warfare 'in different parts of the country,
as all persons know who , have read his
tories. We. might have had fifty in our
band, but we seldom had over a dozen.
It was not safe to travel with more. We
always traveled together at night. "In
the day time we divided up, perhaps one
going alone or two together, but. we al

next evening, perhaps ten or twenty
miles away.. I had a wife then living In

see her, but never slept in the ". house.

free Staters at will and never wal the re
ward offered for them. But Just as soon
as we started to get revenge we were
branded as criminals. Stop with that re
ward offered for us! Never! We started
out with new life.
"Sheriff Williams asked if we should
follow them any more, but Brown said
that was enough for that day and we
should go back and bury his boy. We did
not lose a single man. The next day we
buried Brown's son. The next week we
heard of some slave State- men on Potta

cleared out every pro-slavery man on the
Creek. That is what was called the Potta

They did not see us because. we kept be

we opened with our rifles, Â«uid followed
this with our six-shooters. This para

but fled. We killed twenty-three of the

The Eton cut, that Is, the pattern that
is cut off at the belt line, is seen in many
a new form. Such liberties are taken with
the. Eton that it resembles its old self In
name only, but. as it Is a convenient and ;
descriptive title, the name remains with :
it." In. the' Etons are counted the littla
jackets that are straight round and rather
full in the back. They are cut off short '
" enough to show "the shirt waist under- Â¦
neath and the front is slashed In a big.
high point, so that the Eton meets only
at the bust line.
The fashionable spring color will be\
navy blue in the dark tones and pink in '^
the light?- Pink and , gray and " the soft,
light tints will be seen 'for street wear.
Waists for day and evening show a ten
dency - to be double-breasted. They lap
over and button one aide, or they button
at one side without lapping, being so out
that the opening comes to simulate a doa
ble-breasted effect. _ ,
Even tho smallest of cloth boleras and
the thinnest ones, designed entirely for
spring wear, and meant to be worn Into
the . summer, have this peculiarity, that
they are double-breasted and fasten with
a button, or a clasp, or an ornament of
some sort.
Gauze, that erstwhile, frivolous trim
ming, has now taken* a standard place. It
comes with satin stripes of allk and it .
can be trimmed with lace. Much of tha
gauze Is open-work, with a lacey stripe
through It; and thera coma ganza rlbbena
that combine lace and satin. These arc
called . millinery ribbons. They are used;
not only for hata, but for bodices. Two
yards of handsome gauza to be employed
as a trimming for an evening shirt waist
is an excellent Investment. Used as tha
basis for a bunch of silk roses, it Is very
decorative, and employed merely, as a
bodice trimming. It is more than rood.
It can be worn again and again and far
exceeds chiffon in durable qualities. Two
yards, say, of black satin striped gauze
can be worn many times upon a bodica.
The New Waist. .
Laces Are Cheap.
Lace.' which took once t> second placa)
to chiffon, now classes wit* It in point of
popularity and price, and can be bought
without the expenditure of a fortune. Tha
imitation laces are so very good and so -
cheap that lovers of lace need not go with
out, but may gratify their desires, In that
they can have lace at reasonable rates,
at about the same ratio of expense as any
other handsome trimming; Indeed, classed
with Jeweled passepenterle, It Is much
â¢lower.
If one desires an evening gown, and
does not wish to wear a low necked af
fair, there are so many others from which
one can choose that the low, bare neck
is far from obligatory.
The lace ruffle of duchess Is attached to
a band of panne velvet ribbon and worn
around the throat, as high as a choker.
Then comes a strip of bare neck, then .a
lace ruffle which hangs from the bust line.
A lace ruffle Is also attached to tha belt
and around the foot there Is another ruffla
of lace. This makes an individual trim
ming that can be worn with any gown.

\For the woman who does not Indulge In
the frivolity of a white satin gown nor a
white gown of any description there Is
black to fall back upon, elegant and ever
ladylike black: and there is tha new
brown, a tobacco color, which is made up
all of one tone without even a dash of
red r but which really looks better with
a little red to set it off. If no more than
a silk rose.
The low neck, which seems too giddy for
the woman of family, who has got out of
the way of It, can now be nicely substi
tuted by the neck of lace or by the lattice
neck,' which is so very effective. This Is
made of a lattice, of ribbon, tha. ribbons
crossing to make a network with openings
as largo as a dime. A very large lattice,
as big as a silver dollar, was observed;
upon an evening gown, and. In tha open
ing of the lattice, lace was set in the shapa
of little, medallions that were caught at
each side with invisible stitches.

A white taffeta, dinner (own trimmed

"That was the starting of John Brown.
No truer man ever lived. He never did
anything till his boy was murdered, and
never after that did he disturb peaceable
citizens. It was only when he heard of
some of the slave State men murdering
or disturbing peaceful citizens that' we
took after them, and then we swooped
down upon them before they knew what
was coming. We were called Jayhawkers
for this, because we lit like a jaybird. ;

the slave power.' â¢Â¦ No one spoke for fully
ten minutes. It Was awful. Then Sheriff
Williams spoke up and asked If we should
follow the raiders. 'By all means, 1 said
Brown. Well, In less time than you could
imagine all of us got together and mount

Bharpe rifles, while eight of us had two

Then we. noticed the old fellow's clothes \
were pretty bad; so we ordered his master
to change clothe3 with him. Oh, but. he*
hated to do" it: but he had to. Just-as
they^ started off the negro remembered he

"Johns Brown has been called a dead

then her martyrdom in, Britain, are the
main events in a quickly changing -series
of dramatic scenes.. The book is written

Speaking of the lesson to be learned
from the War of 1812. in his chapter in
volume VI of Clowes' "The Royal Navy,"
published in this country by Little, Brown
& Co. of Boston, President Roosevelt
says:
"There is unquestionably a great differ
ence in fighting capacity, as there Is a
great difference in intelligence, | between
certain races. But there are a number of
races, each of which is intelligent, each
of which has the fighting edge. Among
these races the victory in any contest will
go to the man or the nation that has
earned it by thorough preparation. This
preparation was absolutely necessary In
the days of sailing ship's; but the need
for it is even greater now, if It be intend
ed to get full benefit from the delicate
and complicated mechanism of the for
midable war engines of the present day.
"No education will fit a coward, a fool,
or a weakling for naval life. But, as a
rule, the war fleets of great nations are
neither commanded nor manned by cow
aids, fools and weaklings; and among
brave Â«nd Intelligent men of different
race-stceks. when the day of battle
comes, the difference of race will be
found to be as nothing compared
with differences In thorough and practi
cal training In advance."
It seems about time to cry a halt to the
publication of letters from some one of
little importance to some one else of less.
Each volume of. such letters printed now
appear of less merit than the ; one preced
ing it. The latest letters, those Qf "Mil
dred's Mother to Mildred," seem to have
sounded the depths of the meretricious In
literature. The only example this collec
tion can serve is that" of a book to be.
avoided by decent-minded people. The let
ters, supposed to U>e from an actress to
her daughter, who is also an actress, are
a chronicle cf a phase of life whose vul
garity is described with a frankness any
thing but agreeable. (Published by the

Twenty-one years ago Mr; James went
from England 'to the State of Nevada.
There for seven years he was' a mission
ary to the Indians, living in almost daily
contact with <he Parutis and other tribes.
It was then that Mr. James began inti
mate acquaintance with Indian life and
lore, which was later to yjeld material
for literary work. Thirteen years ago Mr.
James began a series of original explora

Among novels which seem to retain
their hold longest on the reading public,
the religious novel stands near the head,
and there is no better selling literary
property than the well-written stoifc
which has for Its underlying motive a vi
tal religious theme. Possibly a reason for
this lies in the fact that many people who
look askance upon general novel reading
have no conscientious scruples as to
stories of a religious nature. Take, for
instance, a book that delighted readers
of the last generation, "The Prince of the
House of David," by Bishop J. H. Ingra
ham, which has sold over 4,000,000 copiesâ
the copyright having expired. Then fol
lows "Ben Hur," with its record of 725.000,
still growing; arid there, too, is Dr. "Van
Dyke's beautiful little book, "The Other
Wise Man." Instead of falling off In Its
sales from year to year, as most .works
of fiction do, the Harpers state that "The
Other Wise Man-" has sold better in 1901
than in any previous year since Its publi
cation. A French translation of the book,
done by Mme. E. Auziere, has Just been
issued at Paris in artistic form.
Her beauty and the loveliness of her voice
draw about . her a crowd of the elegant
Idlers who frequent the fashionable town.
Among these is a certain Captain Ma
thews*, whose attentions to the beautiful
Miss Linley become marked. In order to,
save herself from the life of a singer, the
publicity of which she hates, Elizabeth
becomes engaged to a wealthy man, Mr.
Long, who has promised to allow her to
lea*d a life of- peace and seclusion. Eliza

an angler cannot force his fortune by eager

wait upon the weather, and the height of the
water, and the hunger of the fish, and many
other accidents of which he has no control.
If he would angle well, he must not be in

"To epeak without Â©Cense, eir." he began,
"there was a word In your discourse a moment
ago that seemed strange to me. You epoke
of being 'in a hurry,' and that is an expression
which Is unfamiliar to my ears; but if it mean
the same as being in haste, then I must tell
you that this is a thing which, in my Judg
ment, honest anglers should learn to forget and
have no dealings with it. To be in haste Is
to be in anxiety and distress of mind; it la
to mistrust providence and to doubt that the
issue of all events is in wiser hands than ours;
it is to disturb the course of nature, and put

In "The Gentle Life" the praises of a
life of peace and of the beauty of nature
are sung by no less a personage than
Izaak Walton. On a day in. spring in our
own time a man is sitting by the side of a
stream waiting for the appearance of a
friend who has gone fishing some distance
away. "Upon his musings breaks the
noise made by some one walking near.
The man looks up in time to see a
stranger catch a trout In an unusually
skillful manner. This stranger, who is
dressed In the fashion of a bygone day,
stops and enters into conversation with
the father. In answer to an Inquiry he ad
mits that he is Izaak "Walton. In the con
versation which ensues Walton extols the
pleasures of a life passed far from
the misery and confusion of cities. After
a little Walton goes on his way and
passes out of sight, and. of course, out of
the dream of the other. What he says
before he leaves Is worthy of the wisdom
of one from beyond the land of dreams. It
is in part as follows: .
In the first story. "A Lover of Music."
It is a ylolin which Is the object of the
ruling passion in the life of a French
Canadian, Jacques Tremblay. This man
appears suddenly In a small American
village, where he settles down to a quiet
life as village musician. Treblay will
reveal nothing of his past, but the vil
lagers learn to trust and love him for the
gentle nature which they find him to pos
sess. The story of the Influence which
music exerts upon this man's life is very
touchingly and beautifully told.
In e^ery life worth writing, about there U
a ruling passionâ "the very pulee of the ma
chine." Unless you touch that you are grop
ing around outside of reality. Sometimes it is
romantic love, nature's masterpiece of benefi
cent selfishness. â¢ â¢ â¢ But there are other
passions no less real,. Which also have their
place and power in human lire. Some of them
come earlier and sometimes they last longer,
than romantic love. They pley alpngside of it
and are mixed up with it. now checking it.
now advancing- its flow and tlngreins It with
their own color. â¢ * * Music, nature, chil
dren, honor, strife, revenue, money, pride.
friendship, loyally, dutyâ -to these objects end
others like them the secret power of personal
passion often turns. . and the life unconsciously
rollows it, as the tides in the sea follow the
moon In the sky. Â¦ Â¦'Â¦Â¦' \
Wben circumstances cross the ruling passion,
when rocks lie in tlie way, and winds are con
trary, then things happen, characters emerge,
elight events are significant, mere adventures
are transformed into a real plot. â¢ â¢ â¢ To
tell about some of these ruling passoins, sim
ply, clearly and concretely, is what I want to
do in this book. The characters are chosen,
for the most part, among plain people, be
cause their feelirss are expressed with fewer
â¢words and greater truth, not being costumed
for social eltect. The scene is laid on nature's
stage because I like to be out-of-doors, even
when I am trying to think and learning to
write.
ry* COLLECTION of short stories by
f I Henry Van Dyke appears In book.
Aâ 4 form under the title "The Ruling
V, 1 Passion." In the preface Dr. Van
JL Dyke explains his choice of. a titlo
for the book:
The, other stories are "A Brave --Heart,"
"The White Blot" and "A Year of Nobil
ity." These, like the rest, are excellent.
To be sure, there is not to be found in
them the excitement and sudden surprises
which form a prominent feature of the
romances of certain popular authors. ; In
stead, they offer stories of noble lives,
told very simply,, very gracefully, very
artistically. (Published by Charles Scrib
ner's Sons, New York.). â¢Â¦â-..
A devotion to duty bo great that all self
ish considerations fade before" It Is the
theme of the last tale, "The Keeper of the
Light." A lighthouse Is established on a
lonely island. In charge of it are placed
a man and his family. The efforts which
these people make in keeping the light
burning under difficulties which beset
them are of the sort which sometimes
cause common people to become uncom
mon heroes. Â¦ â¢
Of one of the best of his stories, "A
Friend of Justice," a dog is the real hero,
and a real hero he is, too. His name is
Pichou. Not only Is he of an appearance
extremely ugly, but he looks so ferocious
that men and fellow dogs consider him a
natural enemy. At heart Pichou is gentle
and well disposed toward all the' world.
But as most of us judge by externals it Is
taken for granted that Pichou'B ruling
passion is fighting. Forced to defend him
self from attacks on all sides, his great
strength enables him to emerge victorious
from every encounter. As a result Pichou
becomes ,the terror of every neighborhood
In which he lives. The dog has one firm
friend, who understands and loves him
and In whose service he sacrifices his life.
The story is not only entertaining, but,
what is surprising in animal stones .of
this day, natural. Although Pichou is
very clever, still he is like the animals of
real life, and not like certain story book
animals, whose conversations -read' like
the discourses of a philosopher.
Â¦ In "The Reward of Virtue" It is love for
tobacco that forms,* not the ruling pas-,
sion, perhaps, but one that is strong
enough to exert a marked Influence upon
the comfort of the leading character. This
man decides It to be his duty to save for
a certain purpose the money which he
would otherwise spend upon tobacco. His
struggles against his inclination to smoke
are so great as to be almost heroic. His
reward conies sooner than he e'xpects, and
brings with it the possibility of a return
to the object of his devotion.
"There are two sorts of seeds sown in our
remembrance by what we call the hand of
fortune, the fruits of which do not wither,
but grow sweater forever and forever. The
first is the seed of innocent pleasures, received
with gratitude and enjoyed with companions,
of which pleasures we never grow weary of
thinking, because they J have '. .enriched * ! our
hearts. The second Is the seed j of pur| and
gentle sorrows, borne In submission' and with
faithful love, and .these also we never forget,
but we come to cherish them with gladness
Instead of grief, because we see tbem changed
to everlasting 'joys."
"No, no, sir; he that departeth out of this
world without perceiving that It is j fair and
full â¢ of innocent sweetness hath done little
honor to the every-day miracles of divina
beneficence; and though by mercy he may ob
tain an entrance into heaven, â¢ it will be a
strange place . to him; and though he have
studied all that it written in men's books of
divinity, yet because he hath left the book of
nature unturned he will have much to learn
and much to forget. Do you think that to be
blind to the beauties of earth prepareth the
heart to behold the glories of heaven? Nay.
I know that you are not of that opinion. â¢ â¢ â¢
"Trust me, it is the part of wisdom to spend
little of your time upon the things that vex
and anger you, and 'much of y&ur time upon
the things that bring you quietness and con-.
fldence and good cheer. A friend made Is
better than an enemy punished. There is. more
of dod In the peaceable beauty of this little
wood-violet than in all the angry disputations
of the sects. We are nearer heaven when we
listen to the birds than when we quarrel with
our fellow men. I am eure that none can enter
Into the spirit of Christ, hia evangel, save
those who willingly follow his invitation when
he says, 'Come ye yourselves apart into a ,
lonely place and rest awhile.' For since hla

ereen fields, by the lakeside, with humble flÂ»h
ermen for its subjects, the easiest way Into

breath, or yonder warbling vlreo, hidden In her '

thoughts of God? As for fame and power,

They wore buff "weB"eoaU," and their hair.

BEAUTY QUEST DIFFERENT IDEALS OF BEAUTYWhen the fog cleared Lieutenant Beat
tie was sent out to systematically, search
the coast for ten miles in Â©very direction.
The captains of the coasting vessels
kept a lookout through the intense fog
which prevailed, and a hulk was reported
two miles from Point Pedro. â¢ .
Finally the time came, and the light
house tender, officers and visitors went
out to blow the waterlogged hulk to
atoms, but not a sign of the wreck was
to . be seen. V Â¦'
The wreck of the Canada was spoken
off the coast of Skagway, where she final
ly went ashore and gave up the ghost.
The Helen AV. Almy is a good example
of the illusive power of a drifting wreck.
She started out for the gold fields with
passengers and outfits! . She was long
overdue' when a wreck was sighted, up the
coast; which proved to be all that re
mained of the unfortunate ship. Her hulk
floated down to the Golden Gate to lie in
wait, as though, not' satisfied with her
own tragedy, she craved to have a hand
in further horrors. She was of 485 tons
and would have caused untold damage in
a'collision. The mournful tolling of a bell
six miles out of the Golden Gate warned
seafarers that danger lurked nigh. Here
the rotten hulk of the Helen W. Almy
swung, to and fro at the mercy of wind
and wave awaiting the time when the
wheels of the Government should author
ize its destruction. : Â¦ ,-,-'Â¦
she is put on the coast service. Some of
them are lioating coffins. During the gold

on this dangerous northern route.
This bottle was much traveled. After be

course and, after covering 420 miles of
latitude and 1235 miles of longitude, land

, Sealing schooner Pelican, latitude 50 north,
longitude 175 . west â The ship Is sinking. "We
are leaving her In frail boats. Please report us.
M. T. PATTERSON. Chief Officer.
The mysterious loss of the Pelican,
which sailed for Taku, China, from Pu
get Sound October, 12, 1897, was traced by
a memorandum in a bottle picked up on
the beach at Portage Bay by the master
of the sealing schooner Herman. The
Information ' contained in this message
helped in the Identification of what re
mained of the Pelican. The . memoran
dum read:
It took two years, item by item, for the
history of this derelict to be traced back
and the mystery of the missing Nomad
was thus in a measure solved. ?
The wreck in all probability followed the
course of a buoy which went adrift at
Coos Bay and is now used in the harbor
of Honolulu. This buoy was carried south
by the current and went ashore very close
to where the Nomad derelict was washed
up
It is thought that while' making the
run to the Sound from Shanghai, Captain
McAllop of the Nomad followed the great
circle, which brought him off the coast of
Alaska, where he encountered the storms
of January and February, which were
doing so much damage to shipping.
The captain of the Eliza Miller sighted
a derelict off Coos Bay in June, 1S9S, and
from the description given the builders
were satisfied that It was the Nomad.
In December, 1897, the Nomad left China
bound for this coast. In June, 1893, the
hulk of the Nomad drifted ashore bottom
up on the Hawaiian coast and solved the
pitiful fate of the missing schooner.
But another report put preparations to
an end. This report' stated that the Pio
neer was sighted drifting oft the shore
with skeletons lashed to the rigging of
the craft. .
The wreckers were just about to raise
a vessel when a storm came up in the
North Pacific and another boat sunk In
the same spot and lodged across her
stern. This boat was pumped and ralsad
For every vessel that Is laid aside In a
ripe old age In the ship "boneyard," one
hundred others have tragic ends. Fa
miliarity with the sea tends to undervalue
these dangers. In old days when a ship
went to the bottom it stayed there. Now
the wreckers raise vessels that have sunk
and right vessels that have turned tur
tle and send them to continue their
course of usefulness.
One shipbuilder says that every vessel
should be built with the idea that one
day she will sink. She should ba fitted
out with appliances for attaching tho
wreckers' machinery when the wreckers
are anchored over the sunken craft. Tha
"wrecking companies" are In reality
"saving companies." They have finely
equipped tugs, pontoons and derricks
lighted by electricity and able to weather
heavy storms. The light can be let down
so the divers can inspect the sunken ves
sel and report from time to time.
The old bark Southern Chief was a
waterlogged wreck that floated In the
line of coasting steamers until finally
towed in near Cape Flattery, never to go
out again.
A harmless old historic derelict of thÂ»
North Pacific was the steamer Beaver.
She ran on j the rocks off Vancouver
Island, and then slid off into deep water.
She floated around the rocks and was
finally rescued and now her ancient tim
bers are made into mementoes and
sold by dealers. She was one of the
first vessels on the coast. She was orig
inally built on the Thames and launched
in 1S30. The launching was witnessed by
King William. These were the early
days of steam navigation and the launch-
Ing was an event.
When tha fog lifted several small tags

The information from the captains' log
books Is taken to the branch hydrographic
office at the Merchants' Exchange and
utilized in the making of* the monthly
pilot charts. In return Uncle Sam sup
plies captains with maps and reports for
the common good.
This Information Is of Incalculable value
not only In locating dangerous derelicts,
but In many cases the description* given
by the captains solve the mystery of
overdue -vessels. Captains know that this
Is the only way they have of wresting
from the sea her secrets, and the utmost
care is taken in describing these wrecks
and their exact latitude and longitude
when sighted.
The pilot charts show the location of all
wreckage, floating buoys, trees, etc, that
have been seen, and skippers can figure

tides and prevailing winds.

not waterlogged it Is .set on fire and is
not lost sight of until it entirely disap

up with torpedoes made ' for . that pur

The United States steamship San Fran
cisco has made, a record for herself in
the successful destruction of derelicts.
She met a tough proposition in a lumber
laden waterlogged wreck of 248 tons. The
San Francisco was bound for Key West.
She tried to tow the derelict, but finding
that Impossible ehe attached three 34
pound guncotton torpedoes to the keel.
The explosion damaged her, but left her
etlll afloat. Five more torpedoes broke
her frames and weakened her, back.
The San Francisco then backed away
and coming forward with great force
of vessels bound to and from the Orient.
Although the Pacific is much clearer of
floating debris than the Atlantic still it
has its sea waifs, its drifting buoys and
its floating lumber.

The San Francisco is an unarmored war

These well behaved derelicts follow

drift of a derelict Is a secret the old hulk
keeps to herself, for she delights in ghast
ly surprises.
The derelict Port Royal buoy Is one
of the most notable derelicts on record,
having cruised for four years and trav
eled over 2000 miles. Mariners came to
know it well, for it is so plainly marked
with a red P. R. as to ma!:e it easily
identified. It was reported fifteen times
and when last sighted was about 500 miles
east of the Bermudas. A scow, which
was blown out to sea from San Carlos
Bay; Lower California, was sighted in
midocean with the chain still hanging
over the side and attached to the anchor.
Often a vessel becomes a double dere
lict. The bow of one such was spoken
near Honolulu and the stern of the same
was sighted off the coast of Mexico.
Derelicts are bulky things to manage
and few ships have met with success in
towing them into port. They are usually
waterlogged and very heavy and hard on
the tow lines. â¢ Few merchant vessels
can spare the time nor do they dare to
take the risk even for a short distance of
towing in such a dangerous, unwieldy
mass. The most dangerous derelict is
the invisible derelictâ the water-logged
mass that floats just below the surface.

such a distinction, but he emphasized the
necessity of making sure that the Filipino
who must pass upon this problem is a
man of such intelligence., ,
"You cannot." he said, "appreciate the
ignorance and the credulity of the natives
who do not have the advantage of a
knowledge of the Spanish language. The
present difficulty In the islands ia found
in the ease with which the educated Fili
pinos control .or oppress their own peo
ple. In the province of Cagayan they
have a system of bossism and these
bosses have almost the power of life and
death. It is exceedingly difficult to get
into the minds of a people situated as
are the common people the fact that
theirs Is not the only way of living. Con
sequently when one speaks of indepen
dence he Is not understood."
"Do you depend on that ignorance,"
Patterson asked, "to make them amen
able to our rule?"
The reply was an emphatic "No."
"Our hope," said Governor Taft, "Is in
the educated classes."
Replying to questions by Senator Raw
lins. Governor Taft said that three of the
members of the Federal party were as
sociated in the government of the Islands,
but notwithstanding this fact the Gov
ernment-was in no way responsible for
the promises of statehood made by that
party in its platform. Enlarging upon the
subject of the Federal party, Governor
Taft said that it comprised probably a
majority . of the educated people of the
archipelago, but that when- the commis
sion had been asked, to either approve
or disapprove of its platform it had re
fused to do either. Possibly, he contin
ued, the promises had misled him, but as
for himself he held the opinion that the
question of statehood, like the question of
independence, Is, so far In the future that

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Feb. 1.â Rollins

Rollins Bingham was prominent in poli

he 'did not regard It as of present Im
portance. At this point the committea
adjourned until 10 o'clock Monday.
"At ithls L point: Senator. Pattersoh asked
Governor .Taft whether the 1 Filipino | of

guishing between an Independent govern

a man at. the bottom/of a well, who must
necessarily be j ignorant of almost every

ance of, Spanish as the official language
of the islands, for If English should now
be constituted . the ; official '; language It
would be impossible 'to conduct business
without Â¦ the V aid of â¢ interpreters.
Spanish | Language Needed.
In reply: to other 1 -- questions j Governor
Taft said that he estimated that from . 5
to T per cent "of the people read and- write
the Spanish j language, but that he'could
rot say what proportion of '. the ./people
could write their own language. - â¢ One
great difficulty encountered is - the fact
that the people of the different provinces
do not' understand the .'language .'one* of
another. The witness said Â¦ that . many of
the S35 American teachers are engaged in
instructing the Filipino teachers. They
are scattered over the islands in ,455 towns
and they are making good progress,' not
withstanding their own lack of knowledge
of .the natives.' Many of â¢ the American
soldiers had acted as teachers of tho isl
anders and had proved very successful.
The Filipino" teachers were generally, he
r-a id, anxiously availing themselves â¢ of the
advantages thus afforded.. As a rule the
people appeared anxious l to get the edu
cation thus given, but in some cases the
priests were manifesting a disposition to
establish parish schools for their people.
-"The Filipino, is," .he said;' "attached
first to his town and- second to, his. pro
vince, 1 and he is, I think, now forming
an attachment for j the 'name of Filipino.
On that pride of country and on the Fili
pino's desire for education,". he added, "I
base my hope on the success of what we
are doing in the f islands!" , ." ." . ' .
Replying r to Senator, Dubols, the wit
ness said that Laguna and Samar are the
only Philippine provinces which have not
been organized and .that with those pro
vinces organized practically all the Philip
pines capable of being taken would be
under civil government. In reply to other
questions from Dubois, Governor 'Taft
said that the Filipinos have a greater at
tachment for their country than, for. in
stance, the Chinese have for theirs. -
Devoted to Their Country.
In reply to Senator Patterson, ' Governor.
Taft said that there probably were 2,000,-
COO rifles in the hands of insurgents in the
Islands, and there are some of the latter
who do not carry guns. He could not,
he said, tell where the rifles and the am
munition came from.. Some had been re
ceived, from Admiral Dewey before the
beginning of the insurrection, and there
were also rumors of shipments from
Hongkong, other parts of' China and
Japan, but the reports could not be veri
fied. Some Japanese rifles had been
round, but most of the rifles were either
Remingtons or Mausers, indicating either
American or Spanish origin. J As to the
juntas, mogt , of them ] are concentrated
now. at Hongkong, composed mostly of
natives of Batangas, who had made their
money in coffee growing.
:A second trip into. the. northern portion
of Luzon Island was described next. TKls
tour, the Governor said, was made almost
without military escort. ..Cagayari, In the
extreme northern* part of the island, is.
from an agricultural standpoint, the most
magnificent portion of the islands. This
province also contained splendid forests.
He explained that it is necessary to pro
vide a more paternal form of government
for the Igorrotes than for. the Filipinos.
It was also impracticable to place Fili
pino Governors over these people.
.the committee smiled when Governor
Taft said that the Christians had made all
the trouble. \ ' Â¦

Court.
NEW TORK. Feb. Lâ James D. Corr
Â¦was arraigned in court to-day and held
for trial, charged with the larceny of $7000
from the dry goods firm of Le Boutellier
Bros., where he was employed as a book
keeper. â¢
Corr came to New Tork three years ago
from Beverly, N. J. About a year ago
he commenced to pay attention to Ida
WalL She had a sister Edith*, who be
came deeply infatuated with Corr. About
a month ago Edith, believing her love for
Corr was hopeless on account of his in
fatuation for her eister. committed sui
cide by drinking carbolic acid.. This cir
cumstance came to the knowledge of
Corr*s employers and they had him shad
owed for two weeks. Last Wednesday
the firm received an anonymous letter
saying their bookkeeper was Juggling
with the funds. An investigation was be
gun and it is alleged developed a short
age. Corr learned of this fact and booked
passage on a trans-Atlantic steamer, but
he was arrested before he could sail.
Governor Taft snoke frequently of the
unreliability of all estimates' of the popu
lation, '. but said > there, were 'probably
6,000,000 Filipinos, or Christians,. and prob
ably a million of Moros.:' However,' a cen
sus was' badly needed.' .The members -.of
Christians Cause Trouble.
Concluding the narrative of his^southern
excursion Governor Taft said 'that; the'la
dles of the party accompanied the gentle
men to all places to which they went
except ma few Instances. ", These excep
tions were made on account of the fact
that it was necessary to take small ves
sels to* reach them, rendering it Incon
venient for- the ladles to go. The party
had not visited Mlndoro because of Â»cli
matic conditions and because at the time
there had j been no. effort to pacify the
island
"That," replied Governor Taft, "is a
question of Instructions, or rather of
construction' of instructions; but we have
got along so far without. radical disagree
ment. One difficulty of this kind was sub
mitted to Washington, and we were told
that we must reconcile- our differences if
we could. We did so. and have had no
other material difficulties of the kind."
"You speak," said Senator ' Culberson,
"of disagreements between the civil and
military authorities, as to whether there
should'be a civil or military control of a
certain district. In such . cases who de
termines as to what shall be done?"
Referring to the Macabebes Governor
Taft said they had 'always been at war
with their neighbors; that they had for
merly been friends of the Spaniards, and
that when the transfer of the country
was made they had also transferred their
allegiance to the United States. He
thought there were 8000 or 10,000 of them.
The reply was that most of these en
counters had taken place in Batangas, La
Guna, Mindero, Bphol, Samar, Cebu and
a few other places. Most of the tr6ops
in those provinces. â¢
"Within the past ninety days," he said.
"I have observed by the newspapers that
there were forty-one small fights within
the space of thirty daysâ where.do they
occur?" â¢ - â¢ .< . '"
Resuming the thread of. his .narrative
Governor Taf t saidj that the Island of
Cebu was not long organized into a civil
ized government until it was found neces
sary to return to Â¦ military control. ( Ho
had been Informed just before his depar
ture for the United States that the 300 or
400 insurgents on the Island had surren
dered and the island had been entirely
tranquillized. This statement led Senator
Hale to ask a question.
Tranquillity in Cebu.
In his tour Governor Taft had found the
industries in progress, though much in
terrupted, largely on account of the de
struction of the water buiraio. the work
cattle of the islands. This, animal he de
scribed as "the beast of burden, the fam
ily friend, the wealth of the individual
and the object of all the robber bands oJ!
the mountain districts." In the last two
years about 75 per cent of these brute3
had been killed off by a disease â¢ called
rinderpest; and their price had increase!
from $30 to $140 per head. Agriculture also
had been interrupted by insurrection, but
in the vicinity of Manila this was not true
to-day." In the city where the streets are
rough, the witness said the water buf
falo moves so slowly as" to block tho
streets, "and he thought mules should be
imported.- 1 He expressed the opinion that
milk-producing animals might be Im
ported to advantage. There are fine cat
tle ranges,'- but to his knowledge no milk
is produced on the islands.
WASHINGTON, Feb. Lâ Governor Taft,
to-day continued his statement concerning
conditions in, the Philippine Archipelago
before the Senate Committee on the Phil
ippines. He resumed his account of, hi3
last year's tour of the provinces and de
clared that Christian natives are responsi
ble for the discontent and prevailing war
fare. Next to Manila, he said that Cebu
came nearer to being a city In point. of
population and manner of improvemtnt
than any other place in the archipelago.
The Island of Cebu, hb said, is the most
densely settled of the group. It had been
a question whether a civil government
should be established in Cebu, just before
the arrival of the commission therinsur
gents having fired into the capital site,
but the people had insisted and the or
ganization had been perfected. V i Â¦
Speaking generally. Governor Taft said,
there were no roads in the Philippine
Islands under the Spanish, but that since
the establishment of American control
$1,000,000 had been appropriated for road
improvements, both fo.r strategic and
commercial purposes. Most of the towns
are on the sea coast, and the greater part
of the travel for any distance is by beat.
He also said that the wheels of such ve
hicles as are used are so narrow that they
cut up the roads badly. Moreover, the
frequent freshets in the streams render it !
difficult to maintain the roads. In most,
if not all the Islands, Governor Taft said,
there is a mountain backbone, which Is
practically impassable. General Hall had
succeeded ,in crossing the Luzon moun
tains, but his men were almost dead when
they emerged.

"Kitty Grey" has been so successful at
the Apollo Theater that Edwards has
made no extensive preparations for the
piece, which Is to succed it. Its successor
Is entitled "Three Little Maids," who will
be represented by Edna May, Ada Reeve
and Ethel Irving. '
Charles Frohman Is expected In London
at the end of the month, when he will dls
cusa his plans with Gillette. Tho latter
will not return to America this season.
He will reappear In New York In "Sher
lock Holmes" during the month of . No
vember, and will then commence prepa
rations for the production of "Hamlet." <
William Gillette has to vacate the Ly
ceum Theater .In -the middle of February
to make way for Sir Henry Irving. Gil-,
lette has not yet decided .whether to take
another London theater or play through
the provinces. There is no doubt "Sher
lock Holmes" would have run through the
season here.
Charles Wyndham's revival of Haddon
Chambers' "The Tyranny of Tears" at
Wyndham's Theater, with all the impor
tant people of the original cast, including
himself, Mary Moore, Fred Kerr , and
Maud Millett, has been as successful as
the new productions. Anthony Hope's
"Pilkerton's Peerage," at the Garrlck The
ater, has received much needed pruning,
the lack of which at first, imperiled its
existence. "The Importance of Being Ear
nest"* has been so well received at the'St.
James Theater that three extra rows, of
stalls have been added.
At Daly's "A Country Girl" has been so
altered that what at first appeared to be
almost a failure Is transformed into a
genuine success. "Mice and Men," with
which Forbes Roberts and Gertrude El
liott had been touring the provinces, was
first shown In London January 27 at the
Lyric Theater, where it immediately be
came a popular and artistic success, the
first Robinson has had, in years.
So, on the whole, the prospects of the
managers have> never been brighter.
Scarcely a newspaper in town had a good
word to say for "Mademoiselle Mars,"
produced by Mrs. Langtry, January 25, at
the Imperial Theater, yet all London Is
eagar to see the ! actress' wonderful
dresses, and her theater Is crowded night
ly. Every one In society is talking of the
gorgeous clothes worn by Mrs. Langtry
and the other actresses in the play. Mrs
Langtry also wears emerald and diamond
jewelry, including a long chain of dia
monds reaching nearly to her feet, which
excites special admiration.
There has been a wonderful change In
the aspect of theatrical affairs here, and
the majority of the theaters are at flood
tide of success. Old favorites like "Kitty
Grey," "Sherlock Holmes," "Frocks and
Frills" continue to draw overflowing au
diences, while every one of this week's
productions has been equally successful.
Plays whose success on the first night
seemed doubtful are all sharing in the
general prosperity. The visits of the King
and Queen and other members of the
royal family to the theaters this week
have added interest to the productions.
The royal party seemed delighted with
the play, and at the end of the third act
King Edward sent for Gillette and com
plimented him upon the performance. At
the end of the play the King again sum
moned the actor and warmly shook him
by the hand, thanking him for a delijght
ful evening. A great crowd waiting out
side the theater cheered their Majesties
as they left.
LONDON, Feb. 1.â King^ Edward and
Qusen Alexandra, with a Targe suite, vis
ited the Lyceum Theater to-night to wit
ness the performance of "Sherlock
Holmes." Their Majesties' entrance was
the signal for an enthusiastic demonstra

greatly pleased, the. King bowing fre

expressed . the â¢ deepest concern and sym

i A sister of the # Biddles arrived In town
this evening and was admitted to the jail,
but Ed was unable 'to. recognize her. . !

The reason I have you take so much cau
tion is that they will try to trace you to nnd
me. They will say right away as soon as they
come to a realization that you . and I are to
gether, "Find her and you will get the Biddle
boys." So I want you to smooth every track
you make. Don't let them trace.. you from
Plttsburg at all. Change your appearance so
that no one will know you if they are shown
your photograph. If they, can't trace you to
Buffalo, you are lost to them forever. I may
be with you in three or four days; can't tell.
Hide your morphine in the lining of your
"dress somewhere, so if you are searched no
one could find it. And in case the worst comes
to worst, .wait until you are alone, because
if any one knew you took It the doctors would
pump It out with a stomach pump.
If you bo Monday, let me know as early .m
you can. Come close to the window and 6ay
"I will go," for I can't see half you say if It

I will then go to-morrow night (Monday night),
and now, dear, be sure and don't keep me

Mrs. Soffel fell in love with Ed Biddle
in November. The burglar soon realized
his power over her. It was not long until
he started to write love letters to her. His
affection was reciprocated. Mrs. .Soffel
fell madly in love with him, and about the
early part of December he proposed a
plan of escape to her. She consented to
lend him her aid. Between, December 14
and 16 they had completed! all arrange
ments to escape from the Jail. Then they
learned of the Governor's respite. Afcer
this Ed Biddle almost persuaded Mrs.
Soffel to flee with him.' and his brother.
The contents of the letter show it was
originally agreed that Mrs. Soffel was .to
leave the city for Canada on the eve of
the men's escape. The letter in part fol
lows: '
We were searched pretty close to-day and
these fellows would swear on a stack of Biblfid
ten feet high' that we could not have had this
stuff on us since Saturday. . S<;e that you clear
yourself of all suspicion. They â¢ never could
convict you, but some people might suspect
you. That would cut no figure. They, never
could prove it to save their lives. Â¦
It would be much easier 1 for us to get away
if you stayed at home, on account of the war
den, you know. , In case you should not -want
to go. go .to the people at Homestead about
March 18 and call for mail under the name of
Mrs. Charles "VV. McDonald. You will get a
letter telling you where I am and how I am to
get : you. Watch the papers close, and if you
see they have traced us any part of the way,
leave Toronto on the quiet and .go to Mon
treal. Leave letter in the Toronto *offlce- for
mo and as soon as you get settled in Montreal
write me a letter to the postoffice there, all in
signs, where you . are. Montreal is about- 250
miles further north. Keep low until . I reach
you -
The writer took occasion to reiterate
his instructions, because she seemed not
to fully understand. He says:
It don't do to have too much red tape about
it. You must think for yourself. It will be
easy for you to go to Buffalo, then to Niagara,
which is twenty-four miles from Buffalo. From
there take a bus and cross over the suspension
bridge into Canada. Go to' a bank, get your
American money changed to Canadian money,
then ask some boy or woman where the Grand
Trunk station ig. Get a ticket for Toronto.
Since December 2, 1901, they have been
making preparations to escape. The dis
covered epistle tells how Mrs. Soffel car
ried the saws to the cells. It manifests
the extreme enamoration of Mrs. So.tel
for the murderer and burglar, and clearly
shows the wonderful influence Ed Biddle
had over Mrs. Soffel.

* MISS ALICE BROTVN.
Miss Alice Brown, the well-known trained nurse, is in a position to speak wltlj
knowledge. She was formerly with the St. Louis Baptist Hospital and has had
inany trying experiences in her arduous vocation. She adds her valuable testi-
mony to the thousands already received by Swamp-Root. She said in a signed
Interview with a Reporter of the St. Louis Star: .
"Although a woman in my position can receive plenty of prescriptions rrom
physicians without cost, it was upon the advice of a well-known "West End Doc- .
tor that I began to take Swamp-Root. No, I will not tell you his name, for he
might not like it. But all the same, I took it when I was run down from night
work in the sick room. I was thin and yellow and tired even when I rose from my
sleep. Swamp-Root gave me a relish for my food and cleared my blood from itg
stagnant impurities. Of course I do not praise Swamp-Root as a cure for all
troubles, but it is splendid for the kidneys, stomach and bowels and relieves fe-
male disorders when all other remedies have failed to give relief. I know or
many cases in the hospital cured by this wonderful remedy.

\ Weak and unhealthy kidneys are responsible for more sickness and suffering
than any other disease, therefore, when through- neglect or other causes, kidney

The deal, in which the Morgan-Hill pool

than $10,000,000, and the Kansas City. Pe
oria and Chicago Railway is -thereby ab
sorbed into the Northern Securities Com

The lines,. Gates -says, were incorpor
ated into a minor railroad system only a
few weeks ago, but it became important
to the Burlington to obtain that system
to fill up a through line from Kansas City
to the Atlantic coast.
Gates got into the deal by accident. He
bought 5100,000 worth of stock in the
Guardian Trust Company, an institution
promoted by A. E. .Stillwell, who. then
controlled the Kansas City, Pittsburg and
Gulf. Gates did not like the manage^
rcent of the Guardian Trust Company and
he was successful in his application for
a receiver. The railroad lines it controls
south from Kansas City fell into the
hands of the Harrlman syndicate, but the
Professor Alwood, head of the Myco
logical Laboratory of the Virginia Agri
cultural Experiment Station, at BlacKs
burg, Va., has been conducting some in
teresting experiments with these germs,
and has succeeded in thoroughly estab
lishing their utility.
The germa are obtained .from the dregs
of casks which have contained the gen
uine wine, and those of each particular
brand are placed for safe keeping in a
substance prepared from Japanese isin
glass and fruit juice. In this jelly-like
mass the germs soon establish a colon/.
When needed, sufficient ; germs may be
removed with the tip of a sterilized plat
inum wire into- a tube of sterilized fruit
juice. After two or three days the Juice
will be In full fermentation with plenti
ful effervescence. This process Imparts
to the wine the exact' flavor, bouquet and
characteristics of the wine from which
the gyms originally came. .
In France and Germany these germs
are beginning to be cultivated extensive
ly. They can be packed and shipped by
mail to any part of the Continent, or even
to far distant countries, by putting- them
into liquid solution in a tfehtly -sealed
bottle. Professor Alwood hopes to -induce
the United States Department of Agricul
ture to establish a- laboratory for the cul
ture and dissemination of thesfe.im
ported wine germs of world-famous
brands. , .
Wine germs which make it possible to
duplicate exactly the famous wines, of
Bordeaux, Burgundy or the Rhine, in
New York, Chicago or any other place,
are among the latest pets of science.
And considering that the r wine germ,
when carefully handled, has actually been
doing the work required. of him it is safe
to say that he has come to stay.
French Sauterne wines, the Rudes
heimer- white wine and the Lauciro,
made hundreds of miles away from the
home of the genuine article and toned up

spective- wipe germs, have deceived the

When a home Is made unhappy by a
great fault of the husband, if he is worthy
of loving and saving, he Is more effective
ly appealed to- by tenderness than by de
nunciation- or scorn. There are many
men to-day in the wrong path possessed
of worthy attributes, who might be saved
by gentle reprqof from the error of their
ways, but are only spurred on their down
ward course by the unrelenting fierceness
of a scolding wife. Those who have been
saved from evil ways bear witness to
the efficacy of the gentle sympathy and
loving advice of a true helpmeet.
, When properly administered a merited
scolding quickly bears the fruit of better
behavior on the part of the offending onÂ©.
Many wives have spoiled the good na
ture of their husbands by seizing upon
soma fault, trivial perhaps, and constant
ly dwelling upon It.
â¢Let all scoldings be gauged by the error,
but do not make any one rebuke Ions
drawn out. Give each a hopeful ending.
Scolding, viewed in one light, Is really
an accomplishmentâ that is when used for
the proper correction of servants and
children. If you feel called upon to de
liver a rebuke to a servant make it clear
to the offender that your displeasure is
justified; never lose your temper, but bo
calm and dignified, for â¢remember that
your bearing has much to do with the re
spect that you are held in by those under
your authority. Never let a scolding de
generate Into nagging, for if you do you
lose all claim for respect from the de
linquent and the person at fault becomes
your critic, and a very scornful critic at
that.
The woman in authority should study
consideration of other people's feelings.
The common scold or the continual fault
finder Is. perhaps, the most disagreeable
person in the world, not only unhappy
herself, but making others so.

to-night in a banquet to the admiral arid
a; brilliant- reception In; h'onor^-'of Mrs,"
Schley. 'While "the Knights Templar had
the admiral as their guest at the Duncan
Hotel, Mrs. -Schley. was entertained at the
Maxwell' Hoteh by the -ladies of the
patriotic, societies of the city:
Governor McLean has just returned
from Washington and his visit has been
productive of many rumors, the principal
one being to the effect that he Is to be
come a member of the Cabinet. ' In place
of the admiral as a - guest at the ban
quet, the committee, It is understood, is
considering the names of other naval offi
cers, some of whom have their homes in
Hartford and other places in this vicinity.
The action of Governor McLean and
former . Governor Bulkley with other.
prominent members, who took the same
view of the case, Is attributed ., by those
who are. familiar with the affair topolltl
cal reasons..
The committee, nonplused, immediate
ly went* to work to recall the> invitation
and communicated with the Connecticut
Representative. Although the invitation
had ., not actually reached Admiral
Schley's: hands it- was brought to the at
tention : of the 'Maryland Senator, and
the insult is considered just as flagrant
as though It had been delivered to the
admiral.' ' ' - '
Political Reasons Assigned.
5 In March the club la to hold Its annual
banquet atthe'Allyn House and the invi
tation committee, it Is asserted, had de
cided on Admiral Schley aa a guest at din
ner. Negotiations were entered , Into with
the Connecticut Representative in Con
gress to proffer an invitation to the ad
miral. The Representative took the mat
â¢terup with one of the Maryland Sena
tors, and he in turn was to lay the matter
before Admiral Schley when the admiral
returned from â¢ his trip to Chicago.
In the ' meantime the committee had
made known its action to the club mem
bership in general and then trouble be
gan. Governor McLean, , it is said, an
nounced he would not receive Admiral
Schley if he accepted the committee's in
vitation, and former Governor Bulkley,
who Is in line to succeed General Haw
ley in the Senate, took the same stand

The Reichstag tariff committee's votes
this week are regarded as making the
bill's fate more uncertain than ever. The
non-Agrarian supporters of the measure
say the Agrarian majority has gravely
endangered the passage of t... ~..l through
excessive demands. The votes in favor
of certificates of origin and the applica
tion of foreign customs reflations ana
duties agiu t .~. states treating Germany
unfairly, place the Government In an ex
tremely unpleasant dilemma, after the so .
emn warnings of to*Â» Imperial Secretary
of otate for the Interior, Count von Posa
dowsky-Wehner. Much curiosity now ex
ists reg^âng the Goverrnn*>nt'i *iture
attitude. The opinion Is generally ex
pressed that the Government will flna^y
accept the objectionable amendments, re
lying on the Bundesrath not to enforce
them.
Christian science, promoted by Mrs.
Seals and some of her American women,
has been a lively press topic this week.
the city authorities having prohibited
meetings of the newly organized German
eociety In the city's gymnasium on the
ground that psychological treatment of
disease does not deserve the municipal
ity's indorsement. Christian science has
obtained a considerable following in high
social circles. . '/ " - â¢
Professor von Hal!e says that as a re
eult cf his inquiries he does not believe
Americans have bought much German
steamship stock, because the Boerse
transactions therein in 1S01 were few. Pro
fessor von Halle believes it theoretically
possible for Americans to buy the major
ity of the stock of German companies,
elect new boards of directors and transfer
the general offices abroad, but he says
German financiers do not believe the Mor
gan group of capitalists possess such ir
resistible capital as outsiders imagine,,
and asserts that the seemingly gigantic
capital cf the United States is so strongly
watered that it might dlappear In times
cf crisis.
Doubt PoTrcr cf Morgan.
Professor Ernst von Halle, who with
Tjiard Scbwcrtze visited the United States
to study shipbuilding in behalf of the Ger
man Marine Ministry, writes to to-days
Woche advocating some sort cf govern
mental measure to prevent Americans
from acquiring German steamship lines.
Among the suggestion is one that the
lines be officered by government officials,
the ownership remaining in private hands,
as in the case of the Reichbank, or mak
ing the ownership of such stock unlaw
ful for con-Germans. He points out the
difficulty of the Government's buying the
companies outright, as it would involve
the acquisition of property at ports ail
over the world, which might lead to com
plications.
The American colony here will celebrate
EL Valentine's cay (February 14) by giv
ing a minstrel show, the first to* be wit
nessed in Germany. It is for the benefit
of the American Girls' Club, cf which
Mrs. White, wife of the United States
Embassador, is president. Twenty States
and Territories will be represented in the
cast. George W. Reed of Chicago is the
manager of the show.
A German version of Jerome K. Je
rome's "Hiss Hobbs" was produced at the
Royal Theater last evening. The audience
enjoyed the play, but the critics predict
that it will not draw long.
Prince Henry has received in audience
Professor Franke of Harvard and con
versed with him about the proposed Har
vard Germanic museum, manifesting live
ly interest In the matter. Professor
Franke has lectured on the subject at
Munich, Frankfort and Nuremberg. It is
projected to initiate a movement among

Herr von. Podbielski' s statement, may riot be a good 'argument for a tariff on food stuffs,
but it is certainly an unanswerable one in favor of the American 'system of managing > railroads
and regulating freight rates bjr competition* -w;-- : : v -v;; : â -t-^-- -Â¦- ,.-..;-Â¦ Â¦- - x -._.
From Hamburg to :Berlin is but a short distance when measured by American standards. It
would be an argument against Government ownership and operation of railroads; if lit cost as
much to haul wheat that- distance as it does to haul wheat under private management of railways,
from Chicago to New York. W^hen, however, to the American railway haul there is added the
cost of transportation across the ocean,' and it is found that the two combined amount 'to less
than -the rate>from the one German! city to the 'other; the claims of the advocates of Government
ownership vanish into nothingness. 1 Is there any American farmer who would like, to see Ger
man freight fates applied; in tHis country? Â¦ . ~ :
DISPATCHES from Europe giving an account of the tariff controversy in Germany --ire
port Herr von Podbielski, Prussian Minister of Agriculture, as saying that one of the
reasons why a high tariff on food stuffs is "a temporary necessity'-' is that it costs more
to transport wheat from Hamburg to Berlin than from Chicago to Hamburg. In order
to counterbalance the difference in freight ' rates the German: farmer, according to the Minister,
requires a high protective duty upon the produce of his American competitor. â¢/ ...
If the statement attributed to the Minis'tervof Agriculture be true it throws aflood of highly
illuminating'light upon the discussion concerning the comparative merits of . governmental and of
private ownership and control of railroads. In Germany the roads are owned by the. state. In this
country they are owned; by 'corporations. It has been asserted with considerable force and much
frequency that it would be advantageous to us to adopt the Gei man system. In view of that
assertion the announcement concerning the cost of transporting wheat from Chicago to Ham
burg and from Hamburg to Berlin is about. as interesting to us as to the Germans.,

Two long, followed by two short blasts,
are given for approaching road crossings
at a steep grade.
A succession of short blasts Is an alarm
for persons or cattle to ' leave the track,
and they also call the attention of the
trainmen to danger ahead.
Three short . blasts when the train Is
not In motion Indicate that the engineer
is about to back up his train.
Two short blasts of the whistle are
used by the engineer as answer to a sig
r.al from the conductor. For Instance,
the conductor pulls the bell cord a short
distance from a flag station to notify the
engineer to stop at the station. The en
gineer replies with two short blasts.
Should there be no signal from the con
ductor, two short blasts mean ''the train
has parted."
Three long blasts also mess that the
train has parted. This signal Is seldom
given on passenger trains, but Is fre
quently used on freight trains.
Two long blasts Is the signal by the en
gineer to the trainmen to throw off
brakes.
One long blast of the whistle given by
the engineer means that the train is ap
proaching- a railroad crossing and that
teams near the track must beware. "
One short blast of the whlsUe means
danger ahead and put down brakes.
Everybody traveling on a train repeat
edly hears the whistle of the engine blow,
but the average person is unable to In
terpret the meaning. All railroads use
the same code of signals. Here are a few
which are the most generally used:
While she was a litUe girl she was
under, the instruction of her mother at
home. Later she was sent to a finishing
school, and afterward went with a mar
ried sister for a tour in Europe. â¢

ONCE A CASHIER.
TRAIN SIGNALS.
J^i QUESTION OF RATES.
The theme is too' harrowing to be pursued. The mere suggestion is bad^ enough. Let us
hope the plan of improving the red man by a haircut will perish without necessitating the scalp
ing of the barber who tries it. &'0^i?? r ;0JAr'i?t&i \^~.
. Imagine a treatment of the kind tried upon the youth. of the universities who waste their
time" and energies on football. How would governmental hair-cutting suit them? What man
ner of college yell would arise were the. rule, applied with the use of force when necessary? How
would the law act upon the long-haired : men who agitate for reform," or upon the short-haired
women who assist them? Then there are the more serious questionings concerning the possibility
of improving the ladies by setting Government agents to inspect their faces and remove any sug
gestions of paint. Finally, suppose the law set about regulating: golf clothes, and the kind of dances
that are in vogue in festal scenes?
- While it is generally desirable that governmental orders be attended with a full measure of
success, it is doubtful if the public will have any such desire in this case. A successful experiment
in government is very apt to lead, to an extension of the rule. Consequently should the Gov
ernment succeed in reforming red men by. means of a barber-shop and anti-cosmetic treatment ac
companied by a suppression of dancing, there may. come a time when reforming officials will feel
inclined to try the same treatment upon white men. Then there, will be trouble.
BELIEVING doubtless that manners make ' trie man, the officials of the Indian Bureau
/_; have decided to undertake to reform the wards of the nation by compelling them to
abandon a good many of their savage manners, including the manner in which they
wear their hair and adorn their fnces. Orders are said to have been issued to the In
dian agents directing them to see to it that the hair of the Indian is clipped, that they stop paint
ing their cheeks and dance no more the ghost dance. It appears the new regulations are to be
enforced, if possible, by rosewater tactics; for the agents have been instructed to "use force only
when necessary."

PERSONAL MENTIOiN.
are more primitive than those of Bot
tom's comedy In "A Midsummer Night's
Dream"; where three chairs and a table
represent a luxurious mansion, and the
same three chairs and tableâ leisurely re
arranged by an American-garbed super
in 'full view "of the audienceâ signify a
courthouse. Nor does the distracting
background of the orchestra that, out-
Wagnering Wagner, Is placed behind the
actors, help the illusion. Neither the
wingless wings, In which, where there is
no property stored, an ever-shifting audi
ence sits making way occasionally for a
boy with a trayful of tea on his head for
the thirsty Thespians behind the
"scenes." But when you get Into the
way of realizing that a man who has
been killed is none the worse dead for
getting up and walking off the stage; that
an actor carrying a small rod adorned
with a -horsehair switch is supposed to
be on horseback; that .a sign post with
certain hieroglyphics painted on it rep
resents a gloomy forest; that a small seat
with curtains before it signifies a bedroom
scene to the Oriental comprehension, and
kindred symbolism, you have gone far
to grasp the conventions of the Chinese
drama and are in a way to enjoy yourself.
You may not be so lucxy as I was the
other night in having. Mr. Chan Cheung,
the "Mayor of Chinatown," play the
courteous host, but you will be at no loss
for amusement even so, if you happen to
strike a comedy like "Wong Die Ye Gong
Chong." -

and is a story of love and Intrigue. It
is all about a haughty young almond
eyed beauty who has made up her mind
to marry only the smartest young man
of the day. She refuses one after the
other the handsome and wealthy suitors
proposed by her persevering papa, and at
last reaohes the venerable age of 21 still
unmarried. They make it hot for her at
home, and she flies for refuge to a "sis
ter house," a sort of Chinese nunnery,
swearing never . to marry. But the ab
bess happens to have a handsome nephew,
the District Attorney, with whom the
disdainful maid falls' desperately In love.
There Is a somewhat similar taddent In
"The Mountebank," where Fanfaronada
Is left out of the feast But the China
man played it all round Mr. Wards'* as
sistant in "The Mountebank" last week,
keeping his white and yellow audience In
a continual* ripple throughout the whole
scene. The haughty maid and her wait
ing girl were played with the usual as
tonishing llfelikeness by two boys, and
altogether "Wong Die Ye Gong Chong"
was a bargain at the prlco. You'll find
me there again the next time "Janice
Meredith" comes to town. â¢
There needs no Interpreter In the scene
between the two where the lawyer Is at
tempting to teach Handy Andy the pro
prieties. Faithful but stupid Andy does
his best. He cleans his shoes as advised â
but with his sleeve; attends to his nose In
the same glitterlngly unconventional
fashion, sneezes In bis master's face, and
the like broadly realistic fare*. I have
seen nothing funnier or cleverer m the
way of facial play than the hungry serv
ant'Â¦ expression as he watches, his mas

Ah Shong takes the part ot the District
Attorney, and with bis servant furnishes
most of . the comedy. He has a large
sense of humor, a robust and natural
method and a technique that not a few
of his confreres on the white stage might
envy. The servant is played by Ah Yom,
a clever actor who belongs to the Wash
ington-street Stock Company, and who la
supposed to be a sort of Oriental Handy,

He reciprocates, then rides away, and

even honoring him with the hand of hla
daughter. But the first girl's father Inter
feres here and has the young 1 sprig hauled
oft to court, where the venerable Judge
orders the recreant Lothario to marry
the girl. As I left at this Interesting
Juncture I don't know how it comes out,
but. as the Emperor's daughter had Just
made her appearance on the stage there
was probably a halr-pulllnsr scene a la
Chlnols in sight.
FAMOUS CHINKSE ACTOR "WHO RECENTLY ARRIVED FROM NEW

It is probable that there will be some
good violin playing when Jan van Ordt
comes to town. Mr. van Ordt Is with the
Chicago symphony, orchestra, that is to
be heard here toward the end of the
month. He was a long time a pupil of
the great master. Ceasar Thomson, In
Belgium, and before that graduated with

WITH the symphony concert on
Friday afternoon and the two
Hofmann recitals of Tuesday
and Friday, the week has been
rich In musical attractions. I
am not yet over the feelin?~bf Injury at
having to miss half of the symphony con
cert a~^ half of the Friday recital, but
sm ltd congratulating myself on having
heard -he Xew /orld symphony and the
Rubinstein "Barcarolle" even bo. Nat
urally Mr. Hofmann, pupil of Rubinstein,
would play Rubinstein well, but there
Â¦was more In it than that. There was the
note that has been missing from every
thing- else that he has done, in spite of
the marvelous poise and sincerity of all
his work, the note of tenderness, sym
pathy, poetry. He plays Rubinstein
without accent as it were, as one speaks
his native tongue, with an emotional
fluency and musical truth that stamp it
as being born of the heart, not of the
will, and to me it Is a portent of the Hof
mann that will be later, when life's little
ironies and glories have wrung' and
crowned him with their new knowledge.
At 25 he has still the heart of a child,
with the brain of a man and the fingers
of a giant, and what he will be when his
emotions catch up. with the rest of him
it is hard to say. Perhaps a second
Oodowsky, for In "his glittering analytical
faculty he perhaps comes closer to him
than any other player we have heard
here. Ke has not yet the magical finish
cf Godowsky's technique, but It is *a
quality of technique that reminds of the
great master, with a touch of the Ro
eenthal magnificence about It. He is as
sincere and direct In method as Godow
sky also, as unpretentious and modest,
and his limpid clarity of tone and won
derful dynamic control further recall the
preat artist. After Rubinstein, perhaps
Hofmann plays best Chopin and Liszt,
though he Is eminently worth hearing In
anything he does, even In his Beethoven
playing, which is his least attractive
achievement. He will be heard again, it
is good to know, in response to a large
request, in two recitals at the Metropoli
tan Temple next week, where the dis
tinguished young artist will doubtless be
again welcomed by the large army of
admirers he has acquired. '- \

IT will not be forgotten by our readers that . The \ Call discussed our insular expansion pro
gramme, not in the way ; usual at its inception, which was rhapsodical and ecstatic to a de
gree, but in the light .of long' results! The revel of anticipation was amply voiced by
' others; we discussed the morning taste in the mouth of the country.. ,- >Â¦'
- . . The point that requires the retirement of sentiment and enthusiasm to the rear and the
placing of statesmanship in the front has been reached. We-gave warning in ample time, that the'
interests of our. tropical possessions would require a policy and system exactly antagonistic to
our continental interests. It is impossible to administer a tropical country on the same civil,
commercial and industrial system as a temperate zone country. Our view, is vindicated by., the
business Americans who have gone into the. tropics. The American Merchants' and Planters'
Club in Havana is storming Congress with resolutions demanding a marked change in our conti
nental policy in order to promote American interests in Cuba, and is threatening annexation if
it doesn't get what it asks for. Cuba and the American-Cubans are in the minority, but their
attitude brings . forcibly before our people that the situation is practically a demand for minority
an acute reversal of our continental policy. ..Â¦' Â¦â¢ _ %uv
The Call said long ago that production of a commercial surplus in 'the tropics is possible
only by the use of some form of servile labor. Tropical races are void of commercial ambition.
They exert only so much energy as is required for self-support, and as the bounty of nature fur
nishes food, requiring not much more exertion than picking and .eating, it, they pass life
in serene repose. Enthusiasm and sentiment scoffed at this, and drew an illuminated horoscope
for the hardy American who was to go under a vertical sun, clad 'in biue-.(lenim and unquench-
able energy, to sow and reap and gather into barns, and propagate a great race^ as hardy and in
dustrious as the New Englanders. Well, the hardy American has gone to the tropical paradises
to find his energy ooze out quicker than did the valor of Bob Acres. 'The flies, fleas, ticks and
chiggers-fill him full of holes. The giant ants.bite him and eat up his house. Strange diseases
gnaw at his liver and disorder his nerve centers. . His energy evaporates like the dew of the
morning, and there is not enough wreck of him left to pay salvage. '
So, from far Manila comes the cry and prayer of Americans who desire to- commercially
' The American Chamber of Commerce, composed entirely of Americans, has "met and '
unanimously petitioned Congress to open the islands to Chinese , coolie immigration. The
Chinese coolie toils under all suns and in all zones. He is immnneto torrid and arctic diseases
alike. He is temperate, hardy, servile. Therefore these American merchants say to Congress that
"Chinamen if admitted would not enter into competition .witlV local-: labor;" :That is the truth,
for there is no local labor. The petition continues: "The entry; of Chinese into the islands is im
peratively needed, as the tobacco, hemp and sugar lands of the archipelago are only partly culti
vated. Without Chinese the country cannot be properly developed. Building in Manila has-,
been badly retarded on account of. lack of Chinese labor, and immediate action by Congress is
imperatively demanded." â¢ ' ;^/,' : , ; â¢
Only the Chinese rhat were in the islands when we occupied them are there now. As their
nifmber decreases, the hemp, sugar. and tobacco lands go out of estivation in proportion. It is
the story of Jamaica and Hayti over again. The difficulties of the 'situation are multiplied : by the
Filipino opposition to the Chinese. One grievance of the natives against Spain. was the per
mission of Chinese immigration. .The. Spanish merchants and planters held exactly. the same posi- Â¦-
tion on this subject as do the members of the American Chamber : of Gommerce.; They forced the
Chinese coolies into the. country against the will of the natives and built up the native grudge
against Spanish rule. One of the elements in the placatibri of the f Filipinos is ; exclusion of
Chinese. The. only way to get our money back out of the islands is b)Â£ ajimission'of the;Ghinese. ;
We have the choice of peace, without ..plenty, prÂ«plenty,without : .,'peace.' The' two,. conditions are
We can go at odds with our continental policy, admit Chinese ; ' to the islands, establish
special minority legislation, bring all the hemp, sugar and tobabco lands into cultivation, and
maintain an army of 50,000 soldiers to guard the Chinese labors that produces a commercial .sur
plus. Or we can exclude the Chinese and let the Filipinos enjoy -their, tropical paradise in their '
simple Asiatic way, and the American Chamber of Commerce can disband, come home and exr
ploit its enterprise, in .the wheat and corn pit, and speculation in "clear" and "short ribs." :^

Alpers Is Still Losing
Allsted took his dismissal quietly and
asked the Judge if he might have his car
bine returned to him. , The Judge gave
him an order for It on the property clerk.
The Judge said it was quite evident
there was no personal animus nor grudge
in the case, as the defendant did not
know the man and had not even seen him
before. The man was apparently doing
great bodily harm to his former wife and
he considered the defendant was justified
under the circumstances in taking' the
man's life. The case was then dismissed.
Lieutenant Price and Policeman Brown
were called and testified to finding Nor
mile's body. Â¦ Price said he had found
from the neighbors that Allsted bore a
good character and he *was satisfied that
he and Normile had been strangers to
each other, so that there could have been
no other motive for the killing except the
attack upon Mrs. Allsted.
He called at the Vassey home and
learned that she had left there. Then
he heard her muffled scream and saw her
struggling on the ground with a man.
He could not recognize the man in the
dark and thought he might be a footpad,
so he crept up to them and fired the' shot
at the man's head. He forgot all about
the divorce at the moment and only re
membered that she was the mother of
his two boys. ,
Allsted testified to having secured a di
vorce from "his wife on the morning of
the" killing of Normile on the ground of
intemperance'. Although she had been
divorced from him, she had not yet left
his home. On the night of the -shooting
he went to look for her. ;:He had a loaded
carbine with him, as he always carried it
because he had been frequently attacked
by hoodlums.
Mrs. Allsted testified that she met Nor
mille, whereupon he knocked her down,
and when she struggled to her feet he
knocked her down again and throttled
her. She screamed and heard the shot.
Gustav Allsted, the carpenter who shot
and killed Thomas Normile on Bernal

later charged with murder, was given his

months of that time, alleges Mrs. Grauss,
she has lived in fear of her life. Grauss,

wife took Xo staying out nights, and
for three weeks prior to October 1, 1901,
remained away from her Â».appy home
nights from 8 until past the hour of mid

refused to accompany him to places of

of January 5 of this year, wuen he learned
that his wife had made one of a party

Catarrh of
the Jtpach
A Pleasant, Simpl?, but Safe and
Effectual Cure for It
. Catarrh of the stomach has long been con-
sidered the next thtns to incurable. The usual
symptoms are a full or bloating sensation after
eating, accompanied sometimes . with sour or
watery rising, a. formation of gases, causing
pressure on the heart and lungs and difficult
breathing, headaches,, fickle appetite, nervous-
ness and a general 'played-out, languid feeling.
There la often a foul taste In the mouth,
coated tongue and If the interior of the stom-
ach could be seen it would show a slimy, in-
flamed condition. . v
. The cure . for this common and obstinate
trouble is found in a treatment which : causes
the food to . be readily, . thoroughly digested be-
fore it has time to ferment 'and 'Irritate the
delicate mucous surfaces of the stomach. To
secure a prompt' and 'healthy, digestion is the
one ' necessary j thing to do and when j normal
digestion is securefl the catarrhal condition
will have disappeared, g " , Â¦ _ â¢
According to Dr. Harlanson, -the safest and
best treatment I Is to use after each meal' a
tablet, composed of Diastase, Aseptic Pepsin,
a little Nux, Golden Seal and fruit acids.
These : tablets can now be found at all' druÂ«
stores under the name of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, and.';" not being a patent medicine/can
be used with perfect safety and ' assurance that
healthy appetite: and thorough digestion will
follow their. regular use after meals.
; Mr. 1 ; N.: J. IBooner, ' Chicago, 111.,' . writes:
"Catarrh is a local condition resulting from, a
1 neglected cold In' the head, whereby tnÂ« llniac
membrane ;of the_ nose becomes Inflamed and
the poisonous :^discharge -therefrom .pissing
backward into the throat reaches the stomach
thus producing catarrh of the stomach Medll
cal authorities prescribed for me . for three
years' for catarrh - of Â¦ stomach without cure
but to-day I am the happiest' of men after
using only ono box of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets. I.' cannot find appropriate words to ex-
press my good , feeling. â¢.. 1 have found flesh

Colonel PIcquart predicts that the
French feeling against Great Britain on
account of the Fashoda Incident and the
South African war will die out, and, re
ferring to the criticisms of the value of
the British army, he says that when tha
South African "war is concluded Great
Britain will have at her disposal a great
mimber of seasoned troops with which to
reconstitute the British military forces.
. A French alliance with Great Britain
and Italy, however, would, he claims,
procure military advantage of the first
order, because it would give France com
plete naval freedom in a war with Ger
many, while if the alliance provided tor
the active co-operation of Great Britain
the advantages would be incalculable.
The allied fleets would command the sea,
Germany's supplies would be cut and
Germany could not sustain a prolonged
struggle.
Then, discussing the question of
France's alliances, the colonel replies to
articles in the National Review. He de
clares himself in favor of an alliance with
Great Britain and says France will never
consent to an alliance with Germany,
which would imply a definite renuncia
tion or Alsace-Lorraine.
PARIS, Feb. 1â Colonel PIcquart, who
was prominent in the defense of Captain
Dreyfus, is publishing in the Grand Re
vue a series of articles on the military
position of France. He says Franca has
come to the end of her military re
sources, whereas Germany has ample re
sources with which to increase her
strength. France, therefore, must mod
ify her system, and he suggests various
reforms.

found there after it had lain four days,
and that Several other murders had been
committed there in past years.
NEW YORK, Feb. 1.â Two city detec
tives who to-night entered a house wholly
occupied by women on Crystie street while
looking for suspected smallpox cases ac
cidentally discovered what they believe to
have been a brutal murder. On a bed. in
a poorly furnished room lay the body of
a once handsome woman, on whose face
were the marks of dissipation. Her throat
had been cut and in her hands was a
knife. Despite this latter fact, the detec
tives assert that the nature of the wounds
were such that it would- have been almost
impossible for the woman to have inflict
ed them herself. The disorder in the
room, they say, may have resulted from
a struggle.

ciates the output of this State. Undoubt
edly much of the criticism is just. The
effect of belittling the mineral output of
California is misleading to Investors and
is detrimental to the mineral industries of
this State. But the Mint Director cannot
reach all the facts, nor can any one else
under existing conditions. Where mine
owners refuse to admit a representative
of the State Mineralogist to their, works
for purely legitimate purposes, as was re
cently done by the -manager of a great
copper property in Shasta County, the in
dication is that that that concern at least
desires not to have anything known about
its business that can be concealed. The
State Mineralogist may seek to have a
law passed that shall give the State the
right to. inquire for the purpose of making
up official i statements of . the â¢ I mineral
wealth of California. In a circular that
has been recently issued by the State Min
eralogist of California, the following re
lates to the point in question: -Â¦
Facts Are Sought.
The Government has performed a ser
vice for the mining industry of the United
States by issuing a bulletin of the Census
Bureau which, for the first time, segre
gates the facts concerning smelters in
operation in this country. Heretofore
smelting has been reported by the Census
Bureau under the general head of manu
facturing, or as an adjunct. to the mining
industry.
There were, according to the bulletin
that has been issued, 117 plants in the
United States in the year 1899 that were
grouped under the head of lead, copper
and zinc smelters and refineries. The cap
ital i invested in such plants amounted to
$139,254, 138. The value of the product is
returned at as being $358,78(5,472. The
workings of the plants involved the out
lay of $2,150,018 tor salaries of officials,
clerks, etc.; $15,973,626 for wages paid; *3,
088,007 for miscellaneous expenses, includ
ing rent, taxes, .etc., and $279,655,350 for
materials used, mill supplies, freight and
fuel. 1'hese large figures are sufficient, to
arrest the attention of the most casual
observer of the development of the min
eral industries of this country.

The Daily Pacific Builder says that the
building engagements in this city for the
month just closed point to a brilliant
year for 1902. Altogether there were re
corded 170 engagements, representing an
outlay of $1,162,374. In January, 1901, the
amount represented by engagements was
only $483,093. In 1890, when realty waa
moving very well, the January building
engagements amounted to only $603,800.
While this was slightly surpassed In Jan
uary, 1891, therej has not been an equal to
the January record of 1901 until the pres
ent year. This is supplied as another un
mistakable Indication of the general drift
of demand for improvements in San Fran
cisco. ':.'Â¦; -.^'--i--

A vacant Van Ness avenue corner has, been

thing in the history of San Francisco real es
tate. The piece is on the northeast corner of
Van Ness avenue and Clay street, having an

on Clay street. Somo weeks ago It was sold
by Henry L. Dodge for $45,000 to Charles

owner of the adjoinlns residence on Van Ness

Important Properties.
We have the important announcement to
make that some new mortgages are now being
taken in large sums at 4 per cent net â the
borrower to pay the mortsage tax. S That
would mean, at the (ax rate this year, 6.65
per cent grross. Â¦ But next year, or the year
alter the tax rate may be $1 T5 on- the .$100,
or even more, especially in view of possible
bond Issues. No one would have believed a
lew years ago that money would be as cheap
for real estate uses as it now is. The other
savings banks are granting city real estate
loans at 5S4 to t> pur cent, they paying the
mortgage tax. The savings banks ot San
Francisco now have deposits amounting to
$)43,3-t8,4ti8. Of this amount $05,238,103, or
40 per cent only, is loaned on real estate se
curity.
Magee's Circular calls attention to sev
eral facts of importance in relation to
the interests of realty. One or. these is
found in the 'following paragraph: ;
This is more than double the amount
of (he sales in January, 1901, and sur
passes those of January, 1901, by 224 In
number. The record for December, 1901,
was 379 sales and $3,599,805 in .amount.
From this it is made plain that the ten
dency of San Francisco realty is still up
ward, the demand for it indicating that
fact unmistakably. On all sides the hum
of business is heard. Large buildings
and large enterprises are the order of
the time. Money is abundant, as the'
large increase In the deposits in the sav
ings banks and the comparatively email
demand for money on the security of real
estate attests. â¢ .
January" of the present year broke the
San Francisco record in amount of money
represented by real estate sales to be
credited to this city. Thomas Magee &
Son's Real Estate Circular, which was
issued yesterday, furnishes data from
which interesting comparisons can be
made by those who are interested in
studying the material progress of San
Francisco. Last month there were 459
sales, involving the large total of $3,993,583.

EATING IN HAVANA
Yankees Club Together.
In Havana It is the custom to serve
only bread and coffee for breakfast. ' A
l'ttle colony of Americans that felt they
could not do their work until noon on this
kind of a diet clubbed together'and began
importing Grape-Nuts Breakfast Food.
One of them, writing about' the matter,
says: "The modern cooking range had
never been known in Cuba until the
American occupation, and even now they
are scarce, so' that a ready-cooked food
like Grape-Nuts recommends itself to
start with; then the Yankees were accus-
tomed to the food and felt they could
hardly get along without It. They began
buylr.gr In five case lots and one by one
the" larger grocery stores began keeping
Grape-Nuts in stock, so the business
spread, until now great quantities of
Grape-Nuts are used In Cuba, and it is
not only used by the Americans, but the
other inhabitants as well."
This Is an illustration of the way the
famous food has pushed itself into all parts
of the world. Wherever English-speak-
ing people go they demand Grape-Nuts."
They can be found in South Africa.
Egypt, India, China, Japan, Australia and
South America.
Many Americans speak of the homelike
feeling It gives them to see the number-
less buses in the streets of London dec-
orated with great blue signs with the
word "Grape-Nuts" done In yellow let-
ters, and all over England th# great pur-
veying shops distribute Grape-Nuts.
English roast beef has largely given
way to American roast beef, and the old-
fashioned English breakfast of bacon and
potatoes is now supplemented with Grape-
v Nuts and cream. The change was made
for a reason. It has been aiscovered that
almost magical power rests within the
little granules, and this power is set free

ALTURAB, Feb. 1.â Another week has
elapsed In the trial of James W. Brown,
the alleged Lookout lyncher, and the end
does not appear to be In sight. The pol
icy of the defense, apparently, 1b to call
a Kreat many witnesses in the effort to
puncture tha testimony of Hutton and
Morris, the lynchers who confessed, and
to establish alibis for the men implicated
by the confession. For some reason the
defense seems disposed' to stretch out the
trial as far as possible. Thus almost the
entire forenoon session of the court was
wasted in an argument over the admlssa
blllty In evidence of a poster offering a
reward for the apprehension of the lynch
ersâand this after the court had already
ruled that the poster could not be admit
ted.
When Attorney John B. Raker, for the
defense, placed Sheriff Ben Street on the
stand with the view of disproving the
statement made yesterday by one of the
counsel for the prosecution that there
was not one dollar reward offered for the
conviction of the lynchers he raised a
storm that nearly resulted in his being
sent to jail for contempt.
Raker Cto Street)â Have you a procla
mation from the Governor of this State
offering a reward for the lynchers?
Streetâ I have.
Rakerâ I now offer in evidence this â
Sturtevant, for the prosecution, ob
jected, on the ground that it was a poster
and not the best evidence, as it was not a
certified copy.
Rakerâ We want to prove that" this
poster has been flashed in the faces of the
people of Lookout, Bleber and Alturas.
They saw it, acted upon It and believe
in It.
The courtâ I will not acceot that as
competent evidence. Get a certified copy
of the Governor's proclamation and the
court will consider It.
Raker â We expect to show that a re
ward of $200,000 has been offered.
The courtâ I will send the jury from the
room if you continue to make such a.
harang-ue as that. It is all done for ma
licious purpose.
Wants State Official Subpenaed.
Rakerâ I ask for a subpena for the Gov
: ernor's private secretary and C. F. Curry,
Secretary of State. I want to prove 1 these
posters have been circulated all over the
State of California.
The court â Gentlemen of the jury, you
are excused for fifteen minutes. Raker,
I will send you to jail if you continue
such conduct.
Raker â I am through, your Honor.
The , courtâ You always are through
after you have injected your virus before
the jury.
Rakerâ My God, you would kick me out
of the court if I sat here likt a stone and
did not get In evidence for this defendant.
The courtâ You are having your spell
again to-day.
Rakerâ I have not been adjudicated in
sane yet. . .
The court â If you keep on you will be
so.
Rakerâ How about my application for.
subpenas?
The Courtâ It has been your object in
this case to saddle such expense on Mo
doc County. The prosecution's clerk can
make application to the Governor for a
certified copy of the Governor's procla
mation and if there are any funds in the
Modoc County treasury the bill will be
paid by the county. You have no- right
to make the county foot bills for such
evidence. %
, Rakerâ We want to prove the statement
of counsel for the prosecution that there
is no reward Is not true. '
Spencerâ The prosecution wants to shut
out every evidence and hide the facts in
the case. The State offers a reward and
the State, through the Attorney Gen
eral's office, repudiates It. The State is
in a curious predicament.

LODI, Feb. 1.â In an unused portion of
the basement under Friedberger's Btore
the skeleton of a woman was found yes
terday. In the southeast corner of the
basement water from the winter's rains
had seeped through the earth beneath
the sidewalk and by continuous dripping
had washed away a portion of the sida
embankment, exposing to view the bones
of the left foot and ankle. Not a ray of
light enters the celler, and whenever Mr.
Friedberger has occasion to descend to
It, which is seldom, he takes a lighted
lantern. It may be that a portion of the
skeleton has b.een exposed to vie w^ for a
year or more, or It is possible that tho
earth covering the lower portion of the
limbs had but recently caved In. ,
The soft earth was removed and the
skeleton was found to be preserved al
most intact. A gold-plated ring, corroded
till it was almost the color of the bones
of the hand, was taken from the index
finger. Circling about one-half of the in
side of the ring was a name that under a
powerful glass was made out to be
"Clara "Wells" or "Clara Welts." An Iron
retort, such as was used in the mines in
early days for fusing metal, was found
embedded in the earth near the skull.
How the. body came to be entombed
where it was found will probably be for
ever a mystery. That it was given no
formal burial is apparent from the fact
that there was nothing to indicate that
it had ever been inclosed by a casket.

The Antiquated* Barbaric, Un-

which is fermentation, produced by mi-,
crobea in the blood.
To destroy these microbes Is thÂ© Infalli-
ble cure.
Mr. Wm. Radam has made a systematic
Investigation on this subject and discov-
ered that microbes cannot bÂ© destroyed
by the use of drugs. Nothing but a pow-
erful antiseptic gas will destroy them ef-
fectually.
The reason why all disease treated with
drugs Invariably runs its course or be-
comes chronic is due to the fact that a
harmless antiseptic cannot bs compound-
ed of drugs or organic matter.
The only harmless antiseptic yet discov-
ered is "R. M. K."
Owing to its composition, which Is water

power of destroying microbes in the
human body without Injury to the sys-
tem is beyond dispute. In fact, that ques-
tion has been settled In several courts of
law long ago.
The phenomenal success of the health
authorities in preventing the spread of
contagious diseases forcibly demonstrates
that all diseases can be prevented and
cured by RADAM'S HARMLESS 'ANTI-
SEPTIC GAS TREATMENT, because it
strikes directly at the root of the evil.
Having briefly explained the cause and
cure of disease, the following instructions
will - enable any one to prevent and cure
every contagious disease, no matter how
deadly it may be, by the use of R. JI. K.
TO PREVENT DISEASEâ A wineglass-
ful taken internally three or more times
a day will fortify any person against In-
fection. "We have yet to hear of the first
case where children or adults have con-
tracted disease who used the R. M. K. as
a preventive. -

drink enough of the R. M. K. to permeate

quantity required varies with the disease.

Â¦' "I presume," Mr. Blanchard said, "that
there will be an . investigation and the
truth will ,then come out. * It is a question
of .school discipline, .and not only my pro
fessional . record ; and .standing is at
stake, but also the interests of some 400
pupils. For that reason I prefer not to
discuss 'the^chargea ~at all, but to await
the official investigation."
Another phase of the trouble Is that
the next day after the boy's terrible pun
ishment the other boys In Hhe school
gathered in a i vacant lot as Blanchard
was passing by and. threw rotten eggs at
him.. Blanchard. is said to have incurred
the dislike of the pupils because at the
timV President McKinley was assassinat
ed he> called them "little" anarchists."
Roncovieri has instructed Truant Officer
Floyd. to aid Superintendent Webster in
his investigation and to secure such* evi
dence that Blanchard may be criminally
prosecuted if he be guilty of the charges.
i : Principal Blanchard declined last even
ing to make a statement concerning the
charges. . -'
Throw Eggs at Blanchard.
All these allegations are contained' In
the communication filed with Superin
tendent Webster by School Director Ron
covieri, who says that no immediate com
plaint was made because the boy's father
was sick in a hospital in Sacramento. The
first information on the incident was
given by Violet Chadburne and Annie
Mathesen, two pupils of Miss Lois Peck
ham's class, who, told the story to Direc
tor Roncovieri. Their tale was corrob
orated by Miss E. L. Perry, a teacher
In the same school, and also by Vice Prin
cipal -Moores. In fact, it is alleged that
every teacher knew of it.
Not satisfied with punishing Raggio in
this manner, Blanchard is said to have
ordered the doors Â¦ of the classroom
opened and then beat the boy in' the hall
way so as to terrorize the scholars in ihe
various classes. The crying of the boy Is
said to have been pitiful, and the boy was
so humiliated that he did not return to
the school, . but was transferred to the
Wasnington ' I Â¦ Grammar School. Miss
Fisher, in 'whose class he was put, and
Silas W^ite, principal of the school, both
say' that he is a good pupil.
Terrorizing Scholars.
Â¦ The specific ' accusation made against
Principal Blanchard is that he compelled
the boy, who had been playing truant, to
undress. : Blanchard then seized 'the boy
by< the neck, it is charged, threw him
across the chair' face- downward and ad
ministered a j terrible .beating across his
loins and bare legs with three rattans
tied '.at the handles. - ' . ;
School Director Roncovieri filed' a com
plaint yesterday with 'Superintendent of
Schools "Webster- to' the effect that Milton

Raggio, a boy 12 years of age, who is a

Last evening the Mayor appointed the
following committee to make arrange
ments for the funeral of the late Super-
Visor; Dwyer: Supervisors Curtis, Con
nor, Booth, Wilson and McClellan. The
committee at once requested all officers
of the municipal government to attend
the obsequies. â¢
The funeral cortege will leave the late
residence of the deceased, 1320 Utah street,
at -9 o'clock Tuesday morning for St.
Peter's Church, Twenty-fourth and Ala
bama streets, where services for the dead
will be conducted at 9:30 o'clock.
On Monday evening the committee an
nounces its intention of presenting suit
able resolutions to the Board of Super
visors relative to their late colleague and
there will also be a recommendation that
the meeting adjourn out of respect to his
memory.
At the regular monthly meeting of the
Municipal League the following resolution
was unanimously adopted:
Whereas, We have learned with great sor
row of the death of L. J. Dwyer, a Super
visor of this city; and
Whereas, Mr. Dwyer has served this city
faithfully and honestly and has at all times
Â« No arrangements have been made ' for
the funeral, and while there ls r a desire
In political circles to pay marked respect

Supervisor Dwyer's death was heard
with sorrow and the executive board will
take action at its next meeting and ex
press Its sympathy with the bereaved
family and relatives. 'Â¦ . Â¦- Â¦ ' â¢. .. . â¢ . ;
Mayor Schmitz, on hearing of the death
of Supervisor Dwyer, at once ordered the
flags to be half-masted over the City
Hall. .

In the. business world, in political life
and in social affairs Lawrence J. Dwyer
held the esteem of all who came In con
tact ' with him, and his death yesterday]
caused professions of profound regret on
all sides.
He was a strict adherent of the Cath
olic church and was active In the affairs
of St. Peter's Church; where he wor
shiped for many years. He was a cousin
of the Rev. Father Joseph McQuade and
numbered many distinguished clergymen
as his friends. ' .
Supervisor Dwyer was a member of the
Builders'. Exchange and was prominent
In the ranks of the . Ancient Order of
United Workmen, the Improved Order of
Red Men and the Young Men's Catholic
Union. . '
The late Supervisor was married four
teen years ago to Miss Alice Dowling,
who, with their son Lawrence, aged 14
years, and daughter Marguerite, . aged 8
years, mourn a beloved . husband and
father. Two sisters of the deceased,
Misses Annie and Lizzie Dwyer, also
mourn his loss.
Was Devoted to His Family.
During his two . terms of office Dwyer
advocated many measures for the Im
provement of the Mission district, 1 and the
residents In. that section of the city al
ways had a warm spot in their hearts for
"Larry" Dwyer, as he was familiarly
called.
In the recent municipal election Super
visor Dwyer was re-elected , and was
placed on the Committees on Finance,
Artificial Lights, Public Utilities and
Fire.
In January, 1900, Dwyer took his seat
as a member of the first Board of Super
visors called into being under the new
charter of the city and county of San
Francisco. His qualifications were Im
mediately recognized by his brother mem
bers on the board and he was appointed
chairman of the Committees on Streets,
Public Buildings, Fire, Public Utilities
and Artificial Lights.
At the earnest solicitation of his friends,
Dwyer ran for Supervisor at the munici
pal election in November, 1899. He se
cured a big majority over his opponent,
and resigned from the Senate in order to
attend to his duties as a member of the
Board of Supervisors.
Lawrence J. Dwyer affiliated himself
with the Democratic party early, in life
and served on many executive and county
political committees. In 1894 he asked the
confidence of the voters In Thirty
third Assembly District and was elected
to the State Legislature as, an Assembly
man. He served in the Assembly with
great credit to himself, and In 1896 was
elected Senator.
Served in the Legislature.
The late Supervisor was a prominent
figure In local politics and in the business
world. He was born in Boston, Mass.,
forty-two years ago, and came to this
city with his parents when ho was four
years of age. He was educated In the
public schools, and early in life learned
the trade of a painter. He rapidly went
to the front and soon after reaching his
majority was actively engaged as a mas
ter painter, employing a large force of
assistants, enjoying the patronage of lead-
Ing citizens until his death.
The severe cold developed Into pleurisy
and then into pleuTO-pneumonia, and de
spite the efforts of Doctors Lagan and
Gallway, death claimed the patient.
Through his earnest devotion to his pub-.
He duties, Supervisor Dwyer contracted
the fatal malady. On Friday of last week"
he attended a meeting of the Finance
Committee of the Board of Supervisors,
though he was suffering from a severe
cold at the time and was advised to re
main in his home.
Â» ;
LAWRENCE J. DWTER. a mem
ber of the Board of Supervisors,
died yesterday at 1:20 p. m. at his
residence, 1320 Utah street, 'after
an illness of a few days' duration,
the Immediate cause of death being
pleuro-pneumonia.
Supervisor Dwyer's loss will be felt by
thousands who will sympathize with his
grief-stricken widow and two children, for
it is no exaggeration to state that he
numbered every one as his friend.
The San Francisco Architectural Club
held its first jinks last evening In the club
rooms at 1* McAllister street. The club
was organized in September last and Is
composed of young draughtsmen who are
employed in various offices of architects.
A. O. Johnson, president of the club, sired
the jinks and a pleasing vocal and Instru
mental programme was presented. Com
petitive designs for a club motto were on
exhibition in the rooms and the decision
of the judges was as follows: First prize.

The death by asphyxiation of Court
Commissioner John J. Mone was declared
a suicide, and that of Eddie Sassaki, an
18-year-old Japanese, killed by an elevator
at 101S Larkin street, was held to be an
accident caused by his own carelessness.
In the case of the death of Frederick
Roller, shot by Thomas Flaherty on Jan
uary 2S, a verdict was rendered charging
Flaherty with murder.
The testimony was that the driver en
trusted the team to the care of a 14-year
old boy, named Leon Oppenheim, em
ployed by the firm as a messenger, and
that the boy had never driven the team
but once before the accident.
In the case of Mrs. Mary Seavler, killed
on January 27 by being run- over by 'a
horse and wagon belonging to Lebenbaum
& Co., the verdict was:
We censure the firm for not having a respon
sible utrson in charjre of eaid team.
We herevi-ith censure the Police Department
and Sheriff for not givinj better and prompter
medical attention to elck prisoners in their
care.
A Coroner's Jury yesterday handed In a
verdict of censure against the police de
partment and the Sheriff for the deaths
of Lawrence Randall and James Young,
prisoners in the branch County Jail, who
died of cirrhosis of the liver caused by in
dulgence In intoxicating liquors. The evi
dence showed that twenty-four hours had
elapsed after it became evident that the
men needed medical treatment before the
prison authorities sent for an ambulance
10 take the sick prisoners to the hospital.
The verdict in each case reads as follows:
Some of the newspapers ' in the south
entertain the idea that the biennial con
vention of the State League of Republi
can Clubs in San Jose next April is to be
a Flint demonstration. The notion is er
roneous. The indorsement of candidates
is strictly prohibited by the by-laws of
the league. The purpose of the conven
tion is to awaken party enthusiasm and
bring voters to the support of Republi
can principles. The convention at Los
Angeles in May, 1500, elected Alden An
derson president of the league and select
ed San Jose as the place of meeting in
1902. No doubt E. ,F. Preston, Frank H.
Short, E. B. Edson, E. P. Colgan. George
C. Pardee, Thomas Flint Jr., Henry T.
Gage, Harold T. Power and others who
have been mentioned as worthy to head
the State ticket may attend the big con
vention, and every one will be entitled to~
all the applause he can get. The orators,
among them General TV'. H. L. Barnes,
Samuel M. Shortrldge, D. A. McKlnlay
and George A. Knight of San Francisco,
John F. Davis of Amador, Judge Mc-
Klnley of Los Angeles, S. C. Smith of
Kern, Judge Melvin of Alameda and
many others of the guild eloquent, may
come In for the honors of applause. Mr.
Shortridge is already in training for the
April event. He goes to Bakersfield in a
few days to speak of Lincoln on the oc
casion of a celebration there in honor of
the great President's birthday.
State IÂ«eague Convention.
I Just before the November election in
' San Francisco the machine programmers
predicted that the election of Wells would
be a great victory for Gage, but after the
defeat of their candidate the word was
quickly given out that the Governor's
friends took no hand in the fight. The
fact is well known that Johnny Macken
zie, Dan Kevane, Walter Parker and
others? were here helping Crimmins, Her
rin, Goldberg, Gunst, Lynch and Dibble
to boom Wells' candidacy. If Johnny
Mackenzie wants to make the next con
test in Santa Clara County a Gage fight
In advance of the primaries, let him make
an open announcement to that effect, 50
that Republicans who would be willing to
support another candidate for Governor
may fall in with Hayes of Rea.
The newspaper organs of the Gage ma
chine, believing that Johnny Mackenzie's
forces are likely to achieve a triumph
over the E. A. Hayes and J. W. Rea
factions in the San Jose spring election,
are now claiming that such a result would
signify a victory for Gage over Preston.

San Jose Spring Election.
It is gossip in political circles that the
readjustment of power in the board will
result in the displacement .of Charles Fay
from the position of clerk. All the
strength that the Democrats were able to
rally was put forward to elect Mr. Fay
as the successor of John A. Russell and
since that strength is diminished the in
dications are that Fay will not be re
tained. The fact is known to politicians
on the inside that Mayor Phelan in the
closing hours of his administration ap
pealed to Republicans through the agency
of Phil Crimmins for assistance in behalf
of Fay. Supervisor Boxton was asked*by
.Crimmins to vote for Fay. The request
was conveyed from Crimmins to the Su
pervisor by Ed Williams, who was re
cently deposed from his office of clerk
of the Justices' Court. The Supervisors
will probably deem it prudent to select
a clerk whose relations toward Crimmins
are not of a sympathetic character.
The place In the Board of Supervisors
made vacant by the death of L.. J. Dwyer
'will be filled by appointment. The charter
vests the appointing: powfi) in the Mayor
! and at the proper time Mayor " Schmitz
will doubtless exercise his prerogative.
It is the impression that the Mayor will
appoint some candidate on the late ticket
of the Union Labor party and the choice
! la not likely to fall on one who stands
Â¦ a good chance of winning' a seat in the
I board by a recount of the votes.

STARTS
WITH A COLD.
Catarrh is a //^^^^g
lingering cold ; // f^^^^l
which refuses j 'A
to yield to or- 'v(vfei "^Â®m
dinary treat- \'/$ljf |1
Catarrh usually starts with a cold tn the
head and if left unchecked In this climate
rarely cets well of itself.
As fresh cold is taken the disease spreads,
getting deeper and deeper, creeping along the
mucous membranes from nose to throat, from
throat to windpipe, from windpipe to bronchial
tubes and from bronchial tubes to lung cells.
The mucous membranes all connect, one with
another. Hence it Is easy to spread from onÂ«
part to another lined with this came membrane.
This is why catarrh in tiie head soon affects the
throat and finally the stomach itself, bringing
on chronic catarrh of the etomach, which Is a
most obstinate form of dyspepsia.
Everybody is now well agreed that catarrh Is
a blood disease and not a local one, and the at-
tempt to cure by local applications simply gives
temporary relief from the purely local symp-
toms without the remotest effect in staying the
progress of the disease.
There is a new preparation recently offered to
the public that is apparently destined to do
away with every other form of catarrh treat-
ment.
This new remedy is not a secret patent medi-
cine, but is a large, pleasant tasting tablet com-
posed of Bloodroot. Red gum from the Zucalyp.
tus tree, end other valuable aad hanniees Epe-
ciflcs, which are taken Internally and seem to
have a remarkably beneficial effect upon the
blood and mucous membranes, apparently elimi-
nating the catanhal pcison trom the whole
Hjrateoau
These tablets, while being pleasant, conven-
ient and absolutely safe to use, have made
. cures In long standing cases of catarrh that
are little short of maivelous. They are sold by
druggists under name of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets, and any catarrh sufferer who has tried
inhalers, lotions, ointments, salves, etc., and
realized their inconvenience and ueelessness
will fully appreciate the difference between a
mere palliative and a permanent cure after giv-
ing Stuart's Catarrh Tablets an impartial triaL
All druggists sell them at 60 cents for full
eized package, end no matter where the catarrh
Is located, in the bead, throat, lungs or stom-
ach, Stuart's Catarrh Tablets will surprise you
with the effective result of even a few days use.

Dr. Geo. Stallman, Dentist. 120 Sutter st.*
The lecture was illustrated with stere
optlcon views of the great parks of the
world, and he told in detail how the work
of man had supplemented the handiwork
of nature. Some of the views were highly
appreciated, particularly those of Golden
Gate Park. ..which the lecturer said would
in time become the most noted municipal
park In the world. He further said that
with the natural resources of the western
slope of the continent its possibilities were
unlimited.
"Art In Landscape Gardening" was the
subject of a lecture delivered last night
by Oscar A. Prager-Wlhdshagen, B. A.,
at the Mechanics' Institute. The lecturer
spoke about the natural con figurations of
landscape as a basis upon which to lay
the foundation for a landscape scene
where nature had not provided the oppor
tunities. He said that the artist could
lay out a scheme on apparently barren
wastes and evolve a garden "fit for the
gods." Â¦ â¢

JUDGE GRAHAM REFUSES lO
TO TAKE CRIMINAL CASES.

night. Mr. Ashe will commence the per
formance of his duties to-morrow.
He Is Appointed Assistant District
Attorney. to Succeed Eugene
Frustrated Thereby. " Â«
Superior Judge Graham, through the
IMstrict Attorney'* office notified Presid
ing Judge Cook yesterday that he djd not
desire any more criminal cases sent to
his department at the City Hall for trial.
Judge Graham's courtroom Is not fitted
lor the accommodation of cases of a crim
inal nature, and he so notified Judge Cook
at the close of the first criminal case as
signed to him. There is no Jury-room
connected with his courtroom, neither is
there a room where the witnesses called
to testify can remain until their services
are needed.
The Board of Supervisors is responsible
for this action on the part of Judge Gra
- ham. Judge Cook upon his election as
1'resjding Judge announced that he would
eend cases to the various Judges irre
spective of whether they were *ivil or
criminal. The board adopted a resolution
directing that no criminal cases should
be tried in the City Hall, because the Hall
of Justice had been selected for the loca
tion cl the cnxninal courts. Judge Cook
contended that criminal cases might be
tried anywhere, and assigned several
cases to Judge Graham to show that he
meant what he sa'd. The lack of suit
able pccommodations. however, is liable
*o prevent Judge Cook from carrying out
liis plans, and it is hardly probable that
any changes will be made by the Board o'
Supervisor*. ,-â¢-

"Executive Department, Mayor's Office.
San Francisco. Ual., Feb. 1, 1902.â To the i
Grand Jury of the City and County of San
Franciscoâ Gentlemen: In the discharge
ot my duty as chief > magistrate of this
city i feel it incumbent upon me to call
to your attentfon the arbitrary, and high
handed acts of the J istices of the Peace
of -the city and county of San. Francisco
in the matter of the selection of a chief
clerk of the Justices' Court, and I re-i
gpectfully request you to apply to said
Justices the provisions of sections. 758 to
772, inclusive, of the Penal Code of the
State of California. The high-handed pro-,
ceedings of the last few days certainly
call for drastic action, and in the interest
of the people of San Francisco I.respect
fully submit that conduct of this charac
ter should receive strenuous and imme
diate consideration at your hands. Fol-;
lowing are the facts:
"On January 21, â¢ 1902, written charges,
duly verified, were presented to me in my
official capacity, accusing E. W. Williams,
then chief clerk of the 'Justices of the
Peace, of willful neglect of duty and of
misconduct in office. The definite charges
prefei.ed were based mainly on the con
tinuous attendance. of Mr. Williams,' and
of his deputies, at the racetrack and at
other resorts, and on their constant ab-'
sence from their offices, and the conse- ;
quent neglect of their -official duties..
Other Informal charges based on other
grounds were presented at the same time.
On the filing of these charges, under sec
tion Z, chapter I of article IV of the char
ter, and under sections 18 to 20 of article
XVI, I supendedMr. Williams from his
office, pending Investigation, . and ap
pointed Powel Fredrick in his place to
serve during the period of his .suspen
sion.
Mayor Addresses Grand Jury.
It* was thought during the day : that
Clerk Windrow, the appointee of the Jus
tices, might be arrested for violation of
section Co of the Penal Code, which makes
It a misdemeanor for any one to assume
public functions without having'- filed a
duly approved bond with, the ! Mayor.
Windrow filed the required bond, but tho
Mayor; refused to approve it on the ground
that there was no vacancy in. the office of
clerk of the Justices' Court, he having
previously appointed . Powel .Fredrick. to
the vacancy created by the resignation of
E. W. .Williams. . â¢ . : '
Finding that Windrow* ignored the
threat of arrest, but on the contrary in
vited It' by resuming- his fiinctio'ns ' as
clerk yesterday morning, the Mayor, after.
a long consultation' with his legal adviser,
prepared the; following -tart letter to 'the

Is glad that he has been apprehended and
will go to Los Angeles to prosecute j him.
In order to gain possession of her money
and have him punished, the deserted wife

The "Count de Lucenay," alias Count
Arnold Francis de Presboist; alias John
B. N. Flood,' who was arrested' at Â£1
Paso, Texas, yesterday, is! well known
in this city. He wedded Adelina Biagini,
daughter of Joseph Biagini, a cattle dealer
at 508 Greenwich street, ! on : September 14
last. A week or two after his marriage
he deserted his bride and went to Los
Angeles. There he met Ruby Luckhardt,
and eloped with, her. The authorities
tried to overtake the "Count" and â¢ lodge
him in jail, as the young lady is under. 18
years of age.
Wife Will Prosecute Him.
The criminal charges were preferred
against the fugitive by the District At
torney^ who declares the Count will be
prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Marrying a girl before she has reached
legal, age is a felony in this State and is
a penitentiary offense. To prove 'the
Count guilty it will be necessary only to
establish the age of the '{ girl. -Telegrams
have, been sent to the wife of Presboist
and the brother of the bride, advising
them of the arrest," and that they will* be
needed as witnesses by the State.
Â¦ When Presboist married the . girl here
on January 2 he made oath that she was
more than 18 years of age. He also made
affidavit that there) were no legal obsta
cles to his marriage. As soon as the'.of
ficers here learned that his marriage was
irregular they undertook to trace him,
witn the result as stated in the foregoing.
It was not known that he had married
a girl under age until January 24. Since
that date the Sheriff has been working
on the case.
Sheriff Boone wired the Dallas Chief
that he will leave El Paso in the morn
ing to bring the pair to this city, where
the Count will be tried on . charges of
bigamy and perjury. After the courts
here are through with him he may then
be sent back to California.

RUBY'S "COUNT"
NOW IN A JAIL
Herculean, an 8 to 5 favorite, took the
last race in a drive from Artllla, the third
Â¦choice. Burns, on the first choice, did not
get away from the barrier any too well,
but sailed through his field, beating Ar
tilla at the wire less than a length. Pica
dor was third.
Afghan, with Lee Jackson instead of J.
Woods up, took the slx-furlons selling
event in clever fashion from the 30 to 1
Bhot, Black Dick. Jacqueminot, the light
weight of the party, showed the way to
the stretch, there giving up the lead .to
the favorite, Shell Mount. The 3-year-old
couldn't stand the clip, and under Jack
son's skillful handling, Afghan scored by
a length In 1:14. â¢
None of the six starters in the mile and
a Quarter hurdle event could be accused
of possessing much class, but they put
up a pretty fair article in that line. So
lano and Bonitary ruled favorites in the
ring-, but were unable to land the mer
chandise. Master Lee, a 15 to 1 shot, with
J. Murphy in the saddle, raced and
Jumped Solano to a standstill, and then
won easily from Loyal S and Bonitary.
The racing began with' a half-mile dash
for 2-year-olds. Durazzo, which on his
first essay some daya ago had the misfor
tune to be disqualified, went to the post
a 2 to 5 favorite, ridden by O'Connor.
Adirondack outbroke the bunch, leading
for over half the distance, when the fa
vorite nabbed and beat him with ease.
Honiton ran third.
: Six Â¦ started in J the stake, â¢ which wa3
fifth to be decided. Owing to a well de
fined play: on Horton, some 6 to 5 could
be had about the Bell pair, Sweet Tooth
and. Paul Clifford. From the start, the
stable had .eyerythh.5 to themselves,
Burns on Paul Clifford cutting out the
pace and Sweet Tooth trailing. Had
Ransch, astride MacGyle, met with more
luck the" last three-sixteenths and 1 not
been cut off, there might have been a dif
ferent Btory to tell. As it was, a neck sep
arated the two stable mates at the wire,
with MacGyle only a head farther away;
on the outside. .Horton, ridden- out by
O'Connor, ran a close fourth. Redwald
and Frangible were never factors.
Bob-Smith, appears to be so bubbling
over with luck, of the sort that drives
people to walking -on the water with a
fifty-pound weight in each vest pocket that
he ought to purchase and .burn three dol
lars' worth of Chinese . punk in an en
deavor to drive the hocdoo way. In the
Pacific handicap, after, Lapldus, piloted by
Johnny Daly, had tired, some under the
clinking pace set, Birkenruth, on Smith's
Greyfeld, got -up to the leader, and it
looked all-over but getting in line.- Then,
while little Daly ort Lapldus made his last
rally, Birkenruth sat perfectly still, and
Lapldus won by a nose. One cut of the
whip would probably have altered the re
sult, but that is racing luck. \ For some
inexplicable reason,' La Goleta opened at
8 to 5 and went to 5 to 2. She finished
third, if that is any answer to the prob
lem. â¢ â¢

York turfman's horses were much in evi
dence throughout the afternoon's sport.
For not only did Paul Clifford run second
to his stable mate in the stake, but Black
Dick, secured place honors behind Afghan
with two or three books quoting 100 to 1,

George Gardner Is keenly disappointed
over the outcome of his meeting In Me

Gardner's showing on Friday night was
a disappointment to his friends. He was
overanxious ' from the start and 1 seemed
intent on winning in short order. He com
menced swinging .wildly at as clever a
boxer, as Root and paid -dearly for his
Indiscretion. His seconds ) cautioned him
repeatedly, but he persisted, ' saying he
had it won and that he would stop Root
Inside ten . rounds; . ;' â¢Â¦'Â¦'â¢*Â¦ S . - ;
Gardner wagered 'Â¦ $550.'. on' his own
chances, and was overanxious to cash
his tickets. Alec Greggalns gave an order
to a bookmaker to bet all he could for
him at 10 to 8 on Gardner/; Roots friends
were equally sanguine of success. House
man bet $700 to $1000 that RoQt would win
and advised his friends to have a bet
down on the Chlcagoan. h The betting was
10 to 7 on Gardner until the third round,
when Root was installed favorite. .
Root's real name is Korinek; He Is a
native of Bohemia, a- 1 principality of
Austria. His name translated means
Root, hence the selection of that name
by the boxer when he made this .country
his home. * v- \. , â¢-. Â»
The gate receipts were $7129. .From this
was deducted $100, . Referee Phil Wand's
fee. The fighters received 60 per cent of
the remainder, making their ' share
J3519 50. Root received 75 per cent of this,
or $2767 60, which included $125 allowed him
for transportation from Chicago. Gard
ner's share was $751 90. When the match
was made each man seemed so sure of
winning that there was no thought of di
viding the purse, each wanting the lion's
share to go to the victor.
The outcome of the fight has upset all
calculations of the Yosemite Athletic Club
officials. They had announced a' meeting
on the last day of this month between Joe
Choynskl and the winner, but public senti
ment seems against it. The officials are
in a quandary, i as there are few popular
boxers available. . ;-
Toby Irwln nd James Brltt met at Har
ry Corbett's yesterday and posted a for
feit of $100 each that they would be at
the required weight on the night of their
fight. They also put up a side bet of $500
each. This fight wIU'T)Â© .held under the
auspices of the Acme Club, Oakland, and

TRAEGER WILL COACH
THE CARDINAL EIiEVEN
Frank Slaker "Will Fill the Position
of Assistant Coach at Stanford
During Football Season.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 1.â
William I. Traeger will be head coach as
well as captain of tlte 1902 varsity* football
team. This decision was reached at a
meeting of the first and second, eleven
football players held last night, and their
action will probably be ratified by the ex
ecutive committee.
The plan of having the captain act as
head coach Is adopted directly from the
system in vogue at Cornell and to a large
extent at Harvard and Tale. Frank
Slaker, varsity fullback on the Chicago
and Stanford teams, was selected as as
sistant coach, and on his shoulders will
fall the principal burden of the coaching.
Slaker's work in preparing the cardinal
eleven for its contest with . Michigan was
highly commended. His selection as as
sistant coach meets with the general ap
proval of the student body.
The varsity nine defeated the alumni
baseball team by the score of 6 to 5 in
a close ana interesting game this after
noon. For the visitors Hamilton. Oak
land's outfielder, Walter Christy at sec
ond and "Jimmy" Lanagan, former var

Â§ "You can take a man who is thin, puny and unnourlshed In appearance S

It was Mr. Sterling's quiet modesty that
prevented him from announcing the ap
proaching event to his fellow-workers. in
the Postoffice Department. And it was
that same trait which impelled him to
go far away for the wedding in which his
many friends arc so warmly interested.
There was a touch of the romantic added
to the affair, in that the groom and the
bride-elect are speeding over the rails
from far distant points to Join hands in
wedlock when they shall meet.
There will be a honeymoon trip and
afterward Mr. and Mrs. Sterling will re
turn to Oakland. They will reside at
1266 Franklin street.
The groom-to-be met his prospective
bride a year ago during a visit Mrs.
Swardts was making with friends In
Oakland. Cupid took a hand in the
friendly correspondence which followed
Mrs. Swardts' departure for her Eastern
home. The result !s the wedding, which
will take place at Reno to-morrow.
Mr. Sterling has kept the fact of his
engagement a secret and the news of his
marriage will come as a complete surprise
to his friends and associates, who had
no idea that the trip to Nevada would
have so romantic an ending.
xr>. AKLAND, Feb. l.-George E.
/ \V Sterling, for thirteen years a let
1 IB ter-carrier on Broadway, left this
'\ m Jf morning for Reno, where he will
meet and wed Mrs. Irene Swardts
if St. Joseph, Missouri.
Mrs. Girard said to-night: "I have not
seen the complaint and have nothing to
Bay/about the Â¦ charges until I can con
sult advisers."
Mrs. West is at present a resident of
Arizona, where her husband is engaged
in mining operations. She is Mr. Girard's
eldest daughter and the offspring of his
first marriage. t
Finally Mrs. West prays that the court
take cognizance of the manner in which
Mrs. Girard secured the property and
that she, Mrs. West, be given an equal
division of her father' Restate. She asks
that a receiver be appointed to take
charge of the property until a Judicial de
cision is had determining to whom it shall
be awarded. . * . . -Â¦ ?
Further Mrs. West complains that Mrs.
Girard is extravagant with the personal
property in her possession and that she
spends more than $500 a month on per
sonal expenses.
Charges Extravagance.
Since Mr. Girard's death Mrs. Girard
Is alleged to have secured to her pos
session all the personal property, includ
ing the interest in the Girard Piano Com
pany and the Central Bank shares, from
which she is appropriating to herself the
income. She is also alleged to have held
an auction sale in the family residence,
when all the furniture was sold, the pro
ceeds going to the widow.
All 1 these transactions, the daughter
complains, were done with- the under
standing on the part of her father that
they were to be recorded when he first
anticipated death, but when he recovered
he did not again renew that provision.
Notwithstanding these acts of revoca
tion, the plaintiff continues, on September
21, after the death of Mr. j Girard, Mrs.
Girard obtained possession of the deeds
to the lots in the Rowland tract and had
them recorded. She also had recorded
the deeds to the Monterey. property. -
The death of Girard, who died intestate,
occurred September J.9, 1901. Since then,
the daughter says, there has been no ef
fort on the part of Mrs. Girard to have
the estate probated. She charges that
this Is the result of the stepmother's at
tempts to get hold of the entire estate.
Mrs. West asserts that prior to July 30,
1901, Mr. Girard, fearing that death -was
about to overtake him, executed deeds of
gift, conveying his realty to the defend
ant, though Mrs. West claims that these
documents were never delivered during
her father's lifetime. Subsequently her
father recovered from his fear of death
and revoked the deeds.
Accuses Stepmother.
Mrs. West declares that as the daughter
of Girard she is entitled to an equal share
in his estate. Instead of receiving even
a portion, however, she says that her
father was persuaded to deed away all
his property before his death to his wife
and his other two children, Frank Girard,
aged 19 years, and Ida Girard, aged It)
years. .The bulk of the property went to
the widow. It consists of lots in Oakland
and Monterey, shares in the Central Bank,
stock in the Girard Piano 'Company, cash
and securities of unknown value, but
worth sojnewhere between $50,000 and $100,
000. â¢
"The defendant made false and defam
atory statements to the deceased during
his lifetime concerning 1 the plaintiff," is
the language of the 1 daughter's complaint.
"She created a feeling of prejudice and
hatred between the deceased and the
plaintiff and for many years succeeded in
preventing her from visiting the do
ceased."
In the" division of her father's estate,
which la valued at between $50,000 and
$100,000, Mrs. West asserts that she was
entirely Ignored by him! This refusal to
recognize her, she says, v is due to .the
scheming of her stepmother, :who ac
quired an ascendency over her father's
mind to the absolute exclusion of her*
self . .v
Charging that her stepmother made
false and defamatory statements against
her . and brought , about an estrangement
between herself and father, Mrs. Lessie
West of Arizona began suit to-day against
Mrs. Dora Girard, widow of the late
Frank R. Girard, the former Councilman
and president of the Girard Piano Com
pany, for a division of the estate left by
her paternal relative.

Special Dispatch to The" Call.
John Barrett, the special commissioner
to the Orient, addressed himself to the
task and succeeded in getting Japan to
reconsider her first action. It is the con
fident expectation of the fair management
that Japan's action will determine the de
cision of the other Asiatic powers as to
the fair.;:.\-
Even the European powers, which have
been singularly dilatory in coming to a
decision as to representation at St. Louis,
were informed of Japan's action in thia
matter, and the fair authorities decided
that they must make a supreme effort.
The favorable action of Japan in this
matter is regarded here as one of the ut
most importance to the prospects of the
great fair, Japan had ' at first positively
declined to have an official representa
tion at the St. Louis Exposition, and thia
declination, being communicated to other
nations, was having an injurious effect,
influencing them unfavorably toward the
enterprise. . â¢'â¢';
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1.â A cablegram
received at the State Department from
United States Minister Berry at Tokio 13
to the effect that the Japanese Minister
of Foreign Affairs has assured him that
there will be an official representation oÂ£
Japan at the St. Louis Exposition.
The programme of the administration is

At the conclusion of the eulogies the
House, at 3:55 p. m., as a further mark
of respect, adjourned. '
The House devoted the remainder of the
day to eulogies on the life and public
services of the late Representative Bro
sius of Pennsylvania. The speakers were
Prince, Illinois; Calderhead, Kansas;
Rhea, Kentucky; Lloyd, Missouri; Fowler,
New Jersey; Butler, Pennsylvania; Casset,

The Senate bill to prevent the sale of
firearms, opium and" intoxicants in the
New Hebrides caused some good natured
bantering of Sperry.of Connecticut, who
presented the bill. He said the measure
was designed to prevent our citizens from
selling thesa articles to the uncivilized
people of the New Hebrides, but when
Cummings of New York asked * him
whether there was any law in Connecticut
to prohibit the sale of the same articles
there, he replied, amid general laughter,
that in Connecticut 'the articles were not
only sold, but manufactured. Slbley of
Pennsylvania demanded the ayes and noes
on the passage of the bill. The bill was
passedâ 186 to 15. â¢
After some routine business the com
mittees were called. In response a bill
was presented and passed to grant a right
of way through Oklahoma and Indian
Territory to the Enid and Anadarko Rail
road Company.
When the House met to-day a joint
resolution was adopted to transfer to the
Library of Congress the collection of State
reports in possession of the Industrial
Commission.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1.â The House,
after the transaction ~ot some* minor busi-"
ness, which included the passage of the
Senate bill to prohibit the sale of fire
arms, opium and intoxicating liquors in
the New Hebrides, devoted the day to
eulogies on the life and public services
of the late Representative Brosius of
Pennsylvania.
Under this decision the New York claim
was allowed by Congress, but since that
time no other interest claim has been
paid. The subcommittee, however, con
cluded that under the decision in the New
York case all claims of this character
are legitimate and has made amendments
to the. deficiency bill providing for the
payment of the. interest claims of the
State of Maine and Pennsylvania, the
amount in the first case being about $130,
000, and in the second about $600,000. There
are other States having . similar claims,
but none others -which have been passed
upon by the Court of Claims.
The State of New. York appealed Its in
terest claim from the decision of the
Treasury to the courts, and it was carried
to the. Supreme Court of the United
States, by which it was decided in effect
that the interest paid under the circum
sanceswas in reality a part of the prin
cipaj of the debt of the National Govern
ment to the State. - . '
The committee also has decided to rec
ommend the payment . of the Interest
claims of such States as advanced money
to the United States during the civil war
and are able to show action by the Court
of Claims. In many cases where money
was advanced by the States the funds
so advanced were borrowed and the
States were compelled to pay interest
upon the amounts thus secured.- The
National Government refunded the princi
pal In all such cases, but In accordance
with the practice of the Government re
fused to reimburse thq States for the
money paid on account of interest.
"In neither case was the sum fixed at
to-day's meeting, because of the uncer
tainty of the committee as to the sum
necessary. The figures will, however, be
supplied after communicating with the
State Department and before the bill is
reported on Monday. ,
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1.â The Committee
on Appr6pflatlohs> to-day concluded the
consideration of the urgent deficiency ap
propriation bill. It was amended In sev
eral important details and among the
amendments is one making provision for
the entertainment of Prince Henry, in hid
approaching visit, and another providing
for the expenses of the American Em
bassy to London on the occasion of the
forthcoming coronation of King Edward.
"The second day after separating from
Waller, Porter moved toward Langan,
arriving January 11 with two men, and all
were exhausted. Lieutenant R, P. Wil
liams and over thirty men were left in
the mountains in a similar condition with
the native bearers. The relief expedition
was delayed in starting two days by a
etorm raging and torrents in the rivers.
â¢'The War Department Is advised of the
trip of Major Waller, four officers and
fifty men of the marine corps, thirty-six
native bearers, with four days' rations,
who started the last week of December
from Langan, on the east coast of Samar,
to cross the island to Bassey, about
thirty-five miles distant. A trail at one
time existed, but ; was found in places
only. Lieutenant Lyle's, Twelfth Infantry,
accompanied the command. Incessant
rains from the start, swollen streams and
other natural obstacles made progress ex
tremely slow. When the rations were con
sumed the men became exhausted, rapidly
dropping on the way. Major Waller sep
arated from Captain Porter, Lieutenant
R. P. Williams and the larger part of the
men and proceeded toward Bassey, Â¦where
he arrived January 9 with two officers,
thirteen men and Lieutenant Lyles. He
returned to the mountains the next day
with relief, but returned to Bassey about
ten days later unsuccessful. Porter was
to build rafts, but the timber would not
float. Â« .

FRATERNAL NOTES.
Afterward the Dowager Empress and
the Empe'ror mingled with their guests
and her Majesty conversed with every
one, and particularly noticed the chil
dren. The Emperor was addressed
through an interpreter and bowed with
out speaking. The interpreter composed
his replies. Every lady of the visiting
party was given a pair of jeweled brace
lets and a solitaire pearl ring, besides
other souvenirs.
trustees. An Interesting social hour fol
lowed the installation.
The . Dowager Empress talked ani
matedly. She said that China would
abandon her policy of isolation and adopt
the best features of western life and
would send many students abroad.
Following the reception a banquet was
given. This was spread upon three tables,
the Dowager Empress sitting at the head
of the principal table, and Mrs. Conger
and Mme. Uchida upon either side. The
Emperor was the only man present except
Chang Tsi, prospective Minister from
China to Great Britain, who knelt beside
the Dowager Empress and interpreted
what she said. The Emperor eat at the
head of . the second table. He and the
Dowager Empress touched glasses with
the guests.
In reply Mrs. Conger assured her that
the past would be forgotten. Bracelets
and rings of great value were then placed
upon Mrs. Conger's wrists and fingers.
The Dowager Empress made inquiries re
garding the other ladies who were in
Peking during the siege of the legations
and Mmes. Bainbridge and Morisse,*the
wives of Secretaries Bainbridge and Mor
isse of the American and French lega
tions, respectively, were presented and
warmly greeted. . Â¦
Gifts for the Ladies.
Baron Czikann, the Austrian Minister
and doyen of the diplomatic corps, pre
sented all the ladies to the Dowager Em
press, who tdok the hand of each of
them. They were next presented to the
Emperor, who also shook hands with
them. The guests then retired to an
anteroom. The Dowager Empress, enter
ing the room, grasped Mrs. Conger's
hand, which she held for some minutes,
trembling, weeping and sobbing loudly
and exclaiming in broken sentences that
the attack upon the legations was a ter
rible mistake and that she repented it
bitterly.
Last year the dissensions in the palace
caused a revolution which compelled our hasty
departure, but it is a great gratification to us
that our return to the capital has caused such
rejoicing In China and abroad.
The Dowager Empress' reply was ex
ceedingly friendly in tone. It was in part
as follows:
"We heartily congratulate you and the Im
perial oourt that the unfortunate situation
which led you to abandon your beautiful cap
ital haa been so happily resolved, that you
are now permitted to return in freedom and
peace. The events of the past two years must
have been as painful to . you as to the rest
of the world; but the sting of the experience
may be eliminated by the establishment of
franker, more trustful and friendlier relations
between the Chinese and the other peoples of
the earth. The world is moving forward, the
tide of progress cannot be Btayf d, and it is
hoped that China will Join with the great sis
terhood of nations in the grand march. The
recent Imperial edicts give promise ot great
good to your people and to- your v&bP empire.
Address of Mrs. Conger.
The Dowager Empress occupied ' the
throne, with a brilliant assemblage of
Princesses and court ladles about her.
The Emperor was seated upon a small
platform in the center *of the room. The
visitors upon entering bowed twice to the
Emperor, and several of them ascended
to the throne and bowed to the Dowager
Empress. Mrs. Conger, wife of United
States Minister Conger, as doyeness of
the diplomatic 'corps, made a speech,
which was translated by Secretary Wil
liams. Mrs. Conger said:
PEKING, Feb. 1.â The Dowager Em
press, the Emperor aid the Empress this
afternoon received the ladles and .children
of the diplomatic corps in the palace. The
audience was the most revolutionary
event since the return of the court to
Peking. The excluslvenesa of Chinese
royalty and the prejudices i against the
meeting of the sexes were waived, and the
function was less formal than is usual in
European courts. .
The treasures of,,the Kremlin are said,
on authority, to -be. worth overiÂ£100,000,
000, and the gold on the walls of the pal
ace of Tsarskoye Selo, with Its walls and
ceilings of amber, tortoise shell,. Ivory and
mother-of-pearl, has been valued at near
ly a quarter of a million pounds.
But it is doubtful whether the Czar's
wonders of gold, and jewels can rival
those of the Sultan, the accumulations of
-centuries of predecessors. The Sultan is
as careless of his treasures as the Shah,
and the room In which they are kept has
rather the appearance of a lumber-room
than a treasury of countless millions. But
no disorder can conceal the richness and
splendor of gold vessels filled to the brim
with diamonds and sapphires, rubles and
emeralds; of suits at armor," crowns,
sword scabbards, chains and rings blaz
ing with gems; although, as a traveler
recently declared, "one cannot fall to gasp
with amazement at the spectacle of hun
dreds of beautiful pearls worth probably
Â£60,000 contained in an old tobacco tin."
i The Czar of Russia has a. treasure-house
In each of his many palaces,' any one of
which might well satisfy the ambition of
any monarch In the variety and value of
its contents. Two crowns alone are val
ued at Â£3.000,000: and the jewels in the
Winter Palace, which include many of
the choicest gems in the world, are valued
at many millions more. . â¢ â¢
Of all the native , Princes of India the
Gaekwar of Baroda is the richest in gold
and -jewels, a" mere catalogue of which
would fill some of /the world's richest
millionaires with despair. One of his
most interesting, though', by. no means
most valuable, possessions is a carpet, ten
fe'et long and six, feet in ; width, composed
entirely of a ground-work of exquisite
pearls pn which is traced a design in dia
monds.' This carpet, which certainly has
no rival in the- world, is said to be worth
Â£300,00Q, or Â£5000 a square foot. ,
Of. much greater value than this carpet
of gems is a matchless collar, consisting
of flve rows of diamonds and two of
emeralds, the stones being of graduated
sizes of a pea; from this collar of 700 of
the most perfect .stones in existence
hangs as a pendant the famous "Star of
the South" diamond, one of the most
magniflcent diamonds the world has ever
seen.
Among the countless , treasures of the
Shah are' a* flawless uncut ruby said to
be as large as a hen's egg and of a value
which no one has -.ventured to estimate;
a turquoise as long . as a man's linger,
and a belt a foot wide which Is so closely
set with .many-hued precious stones that
it is one unbroken blaze of diamonds and
emeralds, pearls and , rubies. ;
. One of these scabbards Is completely
covered with diamonds, the smallest of
which is as large as a flnger-nail. < Vessels
of solid gold, so large that only a strong
man could lift one of them, crowns blaz
ing with every color of the rainbow,
chains of gold and rare precious 1 stones,
enamels of matchless beauty, lie scat
tered about in careless profusion; trays
are heaped to overflowing -with sapphires
and pearls, many of which are worth
tens of thousands of pounds. - ':
A glass case two - feet : long and a foot
and a half in width and height is more
than half lilled . with- thousands of pearls,
perfect in shape and luster. By its side
Is a globe of gold, twenty inches, in diam
eter, with seas of emeralds and -conti
nents of rubies and ; diamonds to Che
number of. 50 ,000, and each stone specially
chosen for its beauty. The. weight of this
globe is seventy-five pounds and its value
Â£1,000,000 ' ' . â¢ ... " â¢ , Â¦ : Â¦ :
Those who have been privileged to gaze
on the wonders of the Shah's treasure
house tell astonishing stories of .wealth
which is indeed beyond Uhe dreams of
avarice, and which might well form a
climax to the : marvels of the Arabian
Nights' tales of diamonds and rubies, em
eralds and 'sapphires so countless that
they might literally be measured by the
peck; of shields, helmets and armor thick
ly incrusted with priceless gems, and
sword scabbards which it pains the eye
to look upon, so dazzling are the jewels
which sheath them. :.,,.-
At a time when' millions of men are
struggling their hardest for the doubtful
privilege of keeping themselves alive it
seems difficult to realize that jewels and
gold the value of which is counted in
hundreds of millions of pounds should be
lying hidden in royal treasure-houses, un
touched and seen only by a privileged
and , curious few. Â¦ ' i

The British ship Glenogil will probably
undergo considerable repairing during her
stay in this port. She encountered more
than her share of" the prevailng stormy
weather on her voyage from the antipodes
and had a narrow escape from destruc
tion by fire. The timely throwing over
board of twenty tons of heated coal was
all that saved the ship. Several big seas
came on board at different times and In
nearly every case did tome .damage on
deck. The galley and engine-rooms were
badly wrecked, and a sea shipped over
the stern on December 9 carried away ths
wheel.
Glenogil Sustained 'Damage.

carg^o of coffee and â¢ about $250,000 in
treasure. Among the passengers were
Captain Catterinlch and other officers and
the crew of the ill-fated San Bias, which
was wrecked December 17 about five miles
north of La Libertad. The -Investigation

At a depth of two miles were found
traces of ancient incineration, and near
several charred bones was picked up a
smooth, thick ornament of golden wire,
on which was represented a scene with a
number of typical figures. In the fore
ground sits a woman in a. high-backed
chair holding a round mirror In her left
hand. In her right hand is a cup, from
which a bearded, kneeling warrior is
drinking wine. He Is armed with a bow
and sword. Behind these are a musician
with a lyre, a youth pouring wine into a
cup held by another youth, a priest in
long garments with a sword held In readi
ness to sacrifice a sheep, and a figure
with a fan. The work Is crude, but there

holder!" and others. The full reporfwill be
mailed en request: ' â¢
â¢TACOMA. "Wash., Jan. 27.
1 "Owing to the lateness of the season, we
1 established camp on the eastern side of our
j property and built a mile of trail. We have
a comfortable campâ bunkhouses. cookhouse.
j toolnouee. and will soon have a stable with
! accommodations for 15 horses. â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢ JVo
j have driven one entry 44 feet through hard
I rock, but are now Into a softer rock, which
[ Is - a scrt of cangue between the country
rock and the vein. This entry Is being
I driven to reach a. vein of ore which shows
I ov?r 1C0 foet en the surface, and gave an
assay of Sli SO per ton. principally gold.
Thle ve.n can be traced for 2000 feet through
the 'Stray Deauty Extension' and 'Lourette'
1 dates. We confidently expect to reach this
j vein ten feet irom the end of our present
workings. We have commencedfa new entry
100 feet lower on the \-eln above mentioned,
and are in 15 feet. We expect to reach the
vein about +O f<?et from the beginning of the
tunnel. There is also a large vein of goid-
bfaring quartz on the 'Stray Beauty' which
we *hdl| endeavor to cpen as soon as cir-
cunutasces will permit. This vein Is well
defined; is GO feet wide, and runs parallel
to the one on which we are now working.
.There is also a large vein visible on the
"Ben G' claim, another on the 'Sulphide,'
and a five-foot vein on the 'Ruby Jewel.'
All these veins can be worked from our
present camp. The veins referred to aro
gold-bearing quartz. On the 'Mlnne Bay,*
'Uuun' and 'Mountain Chief - claims are
peveral large veins of copper ore. None of
.these latter claims can be opened now ow-
ing to the fnow.
\ "It is the intention pf the Syndicate to In-
I stall a power plant for drills as eoon as a.
sufficient quantity of rich ore has been
opened to admit of shipping. â¢ â¢ â¢ It is
only a question of energetic and systematic
development work when our properties will
show great mineral wealth.

STOCK AND BOND EXCHANGE.
The Financier says: This week's statement
of the New York Associated Banks shows the
very satisfactory gain of $7,873,500 in cash
exceeding the amount of increase as estimated
from the traceable movement of money from
the interior and through the subtreasury by
$1,754,100. Since the beginning of the year
the gains in cash,- as officially, reported by the
statement, have amounted to $35,013, KOO. while
the estimated increase has been $69,984,600.
As has been the case in recent weeks previous
ly the. gain last week was largely in specie
this amounting to $6,824,000. Loans were ex
panded last week by $19,589,100, reflecting in
some degree the large borrowing during the
week on time and also the activity In com
mercial paper. The deposits show the some
what extraordinary increase of $26,330 200
which amount, it may be noted, is' only Jl,i32 -
400 below the total of the gain in loans and In
cash; hence the statement in this respect very
closely proves. Last year, it will be remem
bered, there were made during the latter part
of January and early in February some quite
notable gains In deposits by the banks. In the
week ending January 19, 1901, for example
the increase in this item was $36,451 000 and
in the week ending February 2 the gain was
$32,494,500. By March 2 the unprecedented
maximum of $1,012,514,000 was recorded an
increase since the beginning of that year of
$158,324,000., This year thus far the gain In
deposits has been comparatively small
amounting to $05,127,200. The surplus re
serve last week gained only $17,290,950, by rea
son of the large reserve requirements of
$6,582,550. The surplus now stands at tÂ°Q -
623,350. against $24,838,825 at the correspond
ing date in 1901. Comparisons of changes in
the Items of loans, specie and deposits of ten
of the larger banks show a net gain of $15 -
300,000 in loans, or $4,200,000 less than the of
ficially reported Increase; a net gain of $3 500 -
0O0 in specie or about $3,500,000 less than the
Increase shown' by the statement, and a net
gain of $18,100,000 in deposits, or $8,200,000 be
low, the officially reported increase. Two Mor
gan banks show gains of $10,000,000 in loans
a loss of $1,900,000 in specie, and a Kain of
$8,000,000 in deposits.

"The redwood lumber delH-erfes for the
months of August and September were below the
normal. ' caused by labor troubles in San Fran
cisco and vicinity. It is difficult to place a
pprcx-ritaee on the various kinds of lumber
turned out from the mills, for many of the
latter are not over-particular in their segre
gation of the species. However, the conditions
of"trade have been most excellent and the best
prices have obtained with but few cxcptlons.
"The export dmands have been extremely
hr-avy and the Washington mills have taken
the greater portion of the business, the mills
in many instances having to run overtime to
complete their orders. The Orient has called
for much Pacific Coast timber products, while
;he demand' from foreign parts, with the ex
â¢Â¦rption of Africa and Europe, has grown rap
idly. All in all, the timber producing dis
tricts of this coast have surpassed all other
in Â¦wealth producing conditions eave those com
ing from agricultural lands."
"The lumber manufacturing interests of the
Pacific Coast erjoyed a most successful export
and domestic shipping trade during the year
19C1 Just closed. Washington. Oregon and
California Increased their quotas, but the mills
of British Columbia dropped about 10,000,000
frt>t in their totals for the twelve months. The
lumber output of the four distinct territories
of California, Oregon, Washington and British
Columbia cannot be accurately estimated, but
Wood and Iron would place the year's cut as
foUawi California. 613.756.000 feet; Oregon,

CHICAGO, Feb. 1.â Wheat began the day
steady, but dropped quickly. Cables were
steady, but Australian shipments, were exces
sive, 1,722,000 bushels, compared with 272,000
bushels in the corresponding .week last year.
There were numerous selling orders early,
though the general trade was light In volume.
Tha increase of l%c a bushel In ocean freights
on grain helped the foreign markets but hurt
prices. Inspiration for any bull turn in the
market : seemed to be lacking in any news at
hand. May opened a - shade higher to a shade
lower at 77%c to 77%c and sold off to '<7%@
77 %c. At these prices offerings became scarce.
There was a revival of . bullish sentiment in
the Southwestern markets and shorts . began
covering liberally. Of late bsars have been
hedging to some degree and seem to prefer
covering. at small breaks rather than to con
tinue going further short. : There was an Im
provement reported In the cash situation, ( the
seaboard foreign demand was picking up and
sellers turned buyers. May reacted quickly and
later fluctuated*- narrowly with an upward
tendency. Â¦ May closed %c higher, firm, at
78%c - .
Corn- opened firm on steady cables. Trad?
waÂ« light and shortly after the start prices
Eagged off on early general selling. The pit
crowd, however, quickly began .to cover and
on the .: Increased . demand the feeling turned
firm. May closed' %'c up at 62%c. :
There was a very email trade in oats. May
closed steady, a shade higher, at 44%@44%c.
Provisions. were dull, save for extensive busi
ness in pork. May pork closed 7%o down, lard
a shade" lower and ribs 2%c down. -
Firmness still prevails and the markfet con
tinues In excellent shape for sellers.

The money market has grown easy, the rate
for call loans dropping to 2 per cent. Railroad
gross earnings for the third week in January
reflect highly prosperous conditions in the
transportation industry. Some of the returns
of net earnings for December show decreases
compared with the preceding December, but
the explanation Is accepted as reasonable that
etorms and floods were accountable for holding
back of traffice, which must ultimately come
forward. The violent break In Jhe grain mar
kets led to some rumors of resulting financial
troubles, but the speculative liquidation there
and the snows in the winter wheat belt, which
prompted It. are considered as beneficial to the
general situation.
There has been an active bond market, es
pecially for junior grades and those whose in
vestment etandint has been below the best
with a corresponding advantage In the interest
return.
United States refunding 2s declined % and
the 4s and new 4s advanced % over the call of
last week.
The renewed demand -for copper has an
Important bearing upon the industrial situation
at lacge, but its immediate significance to the
Amalgamated Copper Company has been much
obscured, perhaps designedly, by many conflict
ing statements. It is persistently asserted that
that company has not only sold out its surplus
stocks of metal atthe low. level, but has en
tered into extensive future contracts at the
eale level. This contention has not prevented
the sharp advance in Amalgamated Copper
shares, and the active demand for raw copper
has given no indication of a market oversold
for future delivery. The collapse in the copper
market and in Amalgamated Copper was an
important factor of depression in the stock
market, but the recovery has had but a feeble
effect on stocks. The proposals looking toward
peace in South Africa, now clearly known to be
under discussion, must be regarded as prom
ising an event ot world-wide importance to the
financial world. It has met with a proportion
ate response In the stock markets of Europe,
but has been quite ineffectual in awakening
speculation here. So it has been with the other
news which is regarded as Important. The re
port of the operations /of the United Steel Com
pany has caused interested comment in finan
cial circles, where there is general assent to
the favorable condition indicated, both for the
trade and for the corporation. The stocks of
the corporation, however, have moved barely a
point during the week. The decision to remove
the war taxes is welcome as a measure of re
lief from the drain upon the open market money
supplies caused by the taking up of the surplus
revenues, which has been a continuing and per
plexing problem.
The speculative movement in stocks this week
was limited almoet wholly to special points.
These points were different on different days,
but the movement never became general, be
yond the light sympathetic effect due to the
efforts of the professional traders to make the
special movements prevail in the genera! list.
A number of developments during the week
have been important in their bearing on the
general financial outlook. Such developments
at a . period of speculative activity like that
prevailing at this time Jast year would have
thrown the market into â¬ state of alarm. The
indifference to' them at this time only serves to
define more clearly the determination of the
money powers of the country to await the out
come of various railroad problems. The fixing
of the legal status of the Northern Securities
Company by judicial legislation seems to be
the most Important of these problems in the
estimation of the streets. Efforts were made
by professionals to put prices up last Monday
in expression of satisfaction with the argu
ments made to the Supreme Court against the
petition for a bearing of a suit against the
company, but there was no important response
to this Inspeculation. . There has been a very
feverish speculation in Amalgamated Copper at
advancing prices durinc the week, based upon
the developments in trading with an urgent de
mand for raw copper, both in this country and
in Europe. The financial condition in Germany
seemed to have had an important influence on
this movement, owing to a large number of
electrical undertakings which were under way
in that country when it was overcome with
financial paralysis and which it is hoped will
be taken up again with the return of confi
dence. . ... â¢ . Â« _
given on Monday. The declaration of the first
quarterly dividend of one per cent on the stock
of the Northern Securities Company and the
mailing of checks to stockholders last night
without announcement were taken as suggest
ive of a desire to forestall possible legal oppo
sition to such action and increased the dispo
tion of the public to await the Judicial decision
regarding the status of the company. The
enormous loan expansion by the banks was
another disquieting factor. Increase in loans
of nearly $20,000,000 In a single week has oc
curred only a few times In the history of the
New York Clearing-house and not at all out-'
Bide the period last spring, when syndicate
preparations were making for the great deals
which afterward electrified the financial world.
For the week ending February 2 last year the
loans ot the New York Clearing-house banks
were expanded $30,440,000, which was the
largest single week's expansion in their his
tory. But the vast expansion of credits the
country over since that time and the email
proportionate increase in cash reserves for the
same periods makes what was a bull Influence
on stocks last year a cause of legislation and
doubt this year. What operations are respon
sible for the past week's large increase in loans
is not known to the public. The bank state
ment counteracted the influence of earlier
strength of Sugar on renewed hopes' of remov
ing Cuban sugar duties, and of the continued
speculation in Amalgamated Copper. The mar
ket closed dul land heavy at mixed net changes.

WHEAT â The San Francisco market was
fairly active on ; call, but prices showed little
change. The foreign markets t were featureless.
Chicago was a shade firmer, but Inactive,
though there was some buying on estimates of
a decrease in the visible supply. The best buy
ing was for. account of the Southwest.
Bo! ton, De Ruyter & Co.'s private letter
from Chicago eald: "Northwest- stocks are
about a stand-off for. the week and a small
decrease in the visible is not unlikely. Broom
hall reports English markets as steady, a bear
ish feature being large Australian shipments.
Export for the- day ia small. Further snow,
followed by a cold wave over the winter wheat
sections,, is predicted, but. the wheat seemr. to
be well covered everywhere and safe from
harm. Here the .market was ' rather heavy
early, but turned strong on covering of local
shorts. Volume of outside speculative business
is less and the market Is tending toward dull
ness.. We think there is a fairly liberal short
interest in the market, and while we see noth
ing bullish in the situation,- scalping markets
are likely." . â¢
