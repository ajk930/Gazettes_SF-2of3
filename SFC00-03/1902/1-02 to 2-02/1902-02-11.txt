Oscar Eilverman, stock-beeper at the

that he remembered selling the costume
to Nora Fuller. It was last October, and
what particularly Impressed the sale on
his mind was the fact of Lawyer Hugh

were Just about closing. All the girls had
gone home and on that account he waited
upon the lawyer, who was somewhat un

minute later Mrs. Fuller and her daughter
and son entered the store, and at Grant's
request the costume was chosen and paid
for by him. There was a good deal- of
merriment over the purchase, and Grant
appeared to be especially pleased- with the
fit 'of the Jacket and asked young Lewis
Parlane. the girl's brother, how he liked
it. The four were apparently In a happy

AH eorts of theories are being advanced
as to the probable time of the commission
of the murder. In the absence of convinc-
Mrs. Fuller also questioned Miss Gra

the man who strangled her daughter only
met her by accident through her answtr

Mrs. Fuller, who cannot be convinced
that her murdered daughter knew her
slayer before she left. home, and Madge
Graham, the girl's chuni, who says Nora
often spoke to her of John Bennett, were
brought face to face last night in Cap
tain Seymour'* office. The young lady
told her story in a straightforward man

break down her assertion that Nora knew
the man who enticed her away from

Emma Searight, the young lady who
met Nora Fuller In Attorney Grant's of

which was substantially the same as the
one published by The Call. She dis
claimed all knowledge of any of the mur

knew her slightly. Miss Searight said that
ehe went to Grant's office about a week
before Christmas on some legal business,
and there 6he met Ncra Fuller. She in

himself John Bennett. He said he never

B. Whitney, to whom at pres

ter of Attorney Grant at his home at. 6x9

base of Lone Mountain, has a strange tale
to tell of how he becamo acquainted with
Nora Fuller.
v According, to Whitney'3 statement, the
little Grant girl, v/ho had been in the care
Of Mrs. Fuller, on the afternoon of Sep
tember 22, met Mrs. Whitney at Golden
Gate Parlc, conceived a sudden idea that
she wanted a "new mamma," and was
duly installed, in the Whitney flat, about
four blocks away from the Fuller resi
dence. Whitney, carefully measuring the
value of each word he ' uttered, declined
last night to tell how or why it happened
that the child's unexpected utterances re
sulted in her becoming a part of the
Whitney household. ; ;â¢ "
Asked for an opportunity to meet the
child, Whitney said:'
; "Unless Grant comes himself, or you
produce a; written order) I will not
bring out the child. She | has made a
statement to us and that is all," said
Whitney. â¢
'. The latter measured his . words care-.
fully. His story is "as follows:
, "When I read the: accounts in the Sun
day papers, I saw there was a tendency to
cast suspicion upon Hugh Grant on the
ground thathe should have been able to
give ; a more positive identification of the
girl's body. The- intimation was that. as
he had known Nora Fuller so long, he
could have stated positively whether or
not it w"as her body that was lying at the
Morgue. '
. "I did. not think .that this was just, 1 for
I did not believe he j knew any. more | of
the 1 mystery than/ you or I. As I had
known Nqra.Fuller. Just as well as he
did, I thought; I would go to the Morgue
and look. at* the body myself., .ThlsT.de.-'
Cided to do without having heard any

so I stopped at Grant's house and asked
him to -go with- me, ; so us to make sure

Third and Mission streets. She -was al
ways accompanied by a. middle aged
man who was slightly , bald and wore a
dark brown mustache! His description
of the man who accompanied the girl to
the restaurant tallies with that given of
Bennett, alias Hawkins, who is wanted
for the crime.
Physicians call attention to a peculiar
circumstance in connection with the body
as it was found â¢which proves conclusive
ly, in view of facts furnished by Mrs.
Fuller, that Nora Fuller was murdered
on or about January 11
The autopsy physician Is Inclined to be
lieve that the girl has not been dead
over twenty days at tho outside, but he
eays that it is quite possible that she
may have been dead since January 11,
although he does not think so. The
â¢weather has boen exceptionally cold since
the 1st of January, and, as the room In
which the body was found â¢was close and
almost airtight, the tendency to decom
pose would be much less than under or
dinary circumstances.
Ing proof to the contrary, the generally
accepted theory Is that the sfrangler took
his girlish victim to the Sutter-street
house on the night of January .11 and
ruthlessly murdered her shortly after
arriving there.
. '.'It was just an accidenti" says^VVhlt-,

he became 'acquainted .with_hlm,: .further,
than the Â¦, alleged ' spontaneous effusion of

ber 22 by Grant's daughter directed, to

anything. â¢ : .
"' Whitney disclaims all, knowledge of
Grant until that eventful Sunday after
noon when Grant's daughter embraced
his wife j in . Golden Gate . Park near - the
music stand and asked to be taken home
to the Whitney fold. Whitney fixes" the
date by the fact that he returned from
some mines in the northern part of . the
State i that evening -and found the- new

sonal knowledge of the man Grant.
"The two girls came in the place and the

did not particularly notice how he was
dressed. . I. think he had a long coat of
the .latest style and a black derby hat.
Nora' seemed glad" to meet him and she
gave her small purchases to the other
girl and went down the street to the
McAllister-street cars. She got on and
went down town. I watched her and saw
the other girl go in an opposite direction.
I do not know which way the man went,
but Nora Fuller seemed happy. That la
the last I saw of them until I saw her
picture in the paper."
Menke has an employe, Ray Zertonna,
a lad. about 16 years of age, who says that
on the night of January 11, as near as he
can remember the date, Nora Fuller and
a girl smaller than she canie to the store
about 5 or 5:30 o'clock and had a few
minutes' conversation. Zertonna said:

Detectives Fisher and Fitzgerald were

positive belief that Nora Fuller had not
come in on a train from Stockton, and
that she had never been in the city from
the hour of her disappearance. Fitzgerald
said he regarded the anonymous letter re

crank and as having no significance what

"I Immediately dispatched Detectives
Fisher and Fitzgerald to the depot. They,
were there on the arrival of the train and
watched every person who alighted. There
were several young girls, but lot one who
tallied with the picture and description
of the girl, for whom they had already
been searching the city. It stands to rea

picture .of the girl in their possession and
with. their experience in hunting up peo
ple on descriptions, would be more likely
to know Nora Fuller if they saw her than
would a conductor who had only casually
glanced. at the portrait in a newspaper.:
"Last Thursday afternoon, February 6,
I received a telephone message from the
Chief of Police of Stockton saying a con
ductor, whose name he did not give, had
informed him that he saw a girl who
seemed to him to look like the picture of
Nora Fuller published in a San Francisco
paper on the train which would reach
Sacramento via Stockton that afternoon.
My understanding . of the message was
that the conductor was not coming on the

EW. KRONE of the Popular res
. taurant, Geary street, grave a
more minute description of
O Bennett last night than. has be
fore been published.
"What peculiarity was there. about Ben
nett?" was asked.
"He had a decided cast In his right eye."
"Did the eyelid droop?" I
"It did, slightly."
"Did his hands indicate that he was
used to manual labor?"
"His hands were always in good condi
tion; by that I mean that he was not
usea to hard work, and, I should say, had
never done any arduous labor."
"What height was he, Mr. Krone?"
"About five feet seven inches."
"Stout?"
"He weighed about 160 pounds."
"In what condition were his teeth?"
"He had excellent teeth."
"Prominent at all?"
"Slightly so."
"Was his mustache gray?"
"No; not at all. It was a brownish
color."
"His chin?"
"Rather long chin; his face, too, was
long."
"Anything J characteristic about his
walk?" "
"Yes, he had something of a military
walk; he took long strides.
"Did he appear to you to be a business
or a professional man?"
"He appeared to me to be a man be
longing to some profession."
: "Did he show by any act In the years
that he had visited your place an Inclina
tion to be studious?"
"It always occurred to me that he was
a studious man; he was always reading,
If not the papers, some book he invaria
bly carried with him." ' â¢ ;
"Anything peculiar about his clothes?"
"No; but he was always well dressed.
A picture published of Bennett in a morn-
Ing paper to-day is not a particle like him,
and Is perfectly misleading. It has not
the slightest resemblance to the man. I
have given you as near a description of
the man as Is, I believe, possible."
A meeting of delegates of the San Fran

The report shows that the classes in the
Marshall School are overcrowded to a
degree hitherto unknown in the depart
ment. Deputy Howard was directed to in
vestigate reports of overcrowding, and in
several classes he discovered that the
limit of pupils was exceded by from
20 to 30 per cent. Although the limit of
pupils per. class is 55, many classes show
ed enrollments of over 65. In one room
five pupils were without desks and In an
other nine pupils Â¦were without accommo
dations for Â«tudy.
* The Marshall School has twelve classes,
and in order that the excess pupils may
be accommodated a classroom must be se
cured in another place. Deputy Howard
reports that a desirable room may be se
cured in a. building 1 near by. and Superin
tendent Webster will recommend that this
be done.
The report of Deputy School Superin

yesterday, and that official has resolved
in consequence to recommend the estab

GRANT DECLARES
THAT DEAD GIRL
WAS HIS FRIEND
PROMPTED by curiosity a large
number of people, among them
many morbid women, visited the
ilorgue all day and evening and
viewed the remains of the mur
dered girl.
A young -woman wearing eyeglasses ap
reared at the Coroner's office shortly
after dark and asked permission to see
the remains. She had a slip of paper
in her hand on which had been written a
detailed description of the dead girl.
"While refusing to give her name or her
address she claimed she had been sent
by Mrs. Fuller to examine the body and
make sure that it was that of her daugh
ter. After closely examining the remains
and discovering the marks of identifica
tion which were described to her by
Mrs. Fuller she unhesitatingly declared
that the dead girl was Eleanor Fuller.
At Police Headquarters.
For several hours last night Captain
Eeymour had his hands full directing his
detectives who are working on the case
end listening to the statements of those
directly concerned in the dread tragedy.
Among those examined by him were Mrs.
Fuller; her son. who identified the body
Sunday; Miss Graham, who was accom
panied by her mother, and Attorney
Grant. The last named was subjected to
b most rigid cross-examination. He told
Â«f hi? acquaintance Â¦with the girl, -when
end where he nsct her. and particularly as
to ihe dress, which he admits having pur
chased for her. His statement to the
headquarters bureau did not differ ma
terially from the one he made for pub
: lication on the day the body was found.
Mrg. Fuller tearfully told of the tele
phone message she had received from her
daughter on the evening of her disappear
ance. She believed the girl's story that
she had procured the situation that she
Â¦went after and that it would be neces
sary for her to remain in the house of
her employer for the night.
Does Not Know Bennett.
Fuller declared that she had never
jnet the slayer of her daughter. Her
Statement was corroborated by her son.
Miss Graham also said that she did not
know Bennett. She denied many of the
published statements that she was a con
stant associate of the murdered girl.
Captain Seymour received a. bundle of
letters from various persons yesterday
giving him advice as to the best way to
apprehend the murderer and offering to
lend their assistance in running down
the fiend. One from an individual who evi
dently thinks he Is a modern Sherlock
Holmes reads that he has traced the mur
derer to his hiding place and will "spring
him," as he expressed it. for a monetary
consideration. The whole bundle of let
ters was, of course, consigned to the
Â¦waste basket.
A young man named Kelly, who is em
ployed by the H. 6. Crocker Company,
looked at the body last night and recog
nized it as that of a girl whom he had
met In a restaurant at Third and Mission
streets. She wag always accompanied by
a middle-aged man, whose description an
swers that of Bennett.
"I took particular notice of them," he
j=aid, "not only on account of the dispar
ity in their ages, but the fact that they
Â¦vi-ould not epeak to each other -while eat
ing their meals. The man would order
the meals, the girl offering no objection to
any dish that was served. From the de
ecription given of Bennett I am satisfied
that he is the man who was the compan
ion of the girl."
Demands Fiend's Arrest.
Dressed in deep mourning and wearing
a veil that completely hid her features a
gray-haired woman Â¦who said she was a
resident of Stockton walked into the
IMorgue yesterday and looked at the body
of the girl.
The unrecognizable face of the victim
<jf the horrible tragedy was hidden be
hind a sheet, but at the request of the
mother the sheet was removed. With a
cry of horror the old lady turned away
and begged to be escorted from the place.
Shortly afterward she appeared at po
lice headquarters and endeavored to learn
if there was any hope of arresting the
murderer. When assured that everythjng
Â¦was being done to land the liend behind
prison bars she left, after threatening to
call on the Governor of the State and de
mand that he offer a large reward for the
arrest of the assassin.

Beautiful gowns added much to the bril

were very elaborate. Flowers of all kinds,
palms, myrtle and ferns were lavishly ar
ranged upon the walls and balcony. The
gaily colored canopy of intricate design
in the . center of the ballroom and the
drooping garlands of myrtle and ever
greens changed the place into a veritable
fairyland." The invited guests were:

part at times, is, on the whole, very good.
H. D. Byers has a humorous parti that

Lillian Albertson has an important role

author starring In his own play "Rag

goer should not miss. â¢ - 4
The scene is laid in Cornwall, England.
The first act culminates in a duel between
two friends, one the hero and the other
the villain of the. play. The quarrel
arises, rather unnaturally, from the
hero's discovery of a secret meeting be
tween his friend and a woman whom
at the time he does not know, but whom
he marries later. The villain is appar
ently killed, but turns up later very
much alive and quite recovered from his
serious wounds. He then returns to his
friend's house and all is forgiven. Com
plications arise, however, when he tries
to renew his former relations with, the
wife of his friend. A woman who loves
the villain and who sees his love. for the
hero's wife is always exerting herself to
cause trouble- betweej. the principals. The
husband becomes suspicious, decides that
hl3 wife is false, and is on .the point of
becoming insane when he learns of his
mistake and the true story of his wife's
rather Indiscreet conduct, and all ends
happily, with the villain and the adven
turess on separate ways slipping into a
comfortable oblivion.
"Raglan's Way," written by Edwin Ar
den, who stars in the; production, drew
a large audience . to the Grand Opera
house last. The play is an excellent one,
on the whole, although some of the situ
ations are somewhat forced.

Heading the cast and company Is
Charles Dalton, who, as Marcus Superbus,
is a strong and dignified figure. It is a
pleasure to hear the clean and musical
elocution of Mr. Dalton, who has a voice
that cheers. As the luxurious Roman
Prefect the actor has an opportunity that
seems to fit his talent to a turn and in
which long repetition of the part seems
only to strengthen his rendering. A
clever sketch of the variously and gener
ously drunken Glabrio is done by Henry
N. Wcnman, who looks the part with fe
licitously Bacchic air. The role of Tigel

George Flood, who gives an earnest and
intelligent portrait of the tyrant's tyrant.

should draw excellent houses during its
stay. It was received with much favor
last night by the small though encour
agingly sympathetic house.
"A Young "Wife" was well received at
Belasco and Thall's Central. Theater last
night. It is by far one of the strongest
and most interesting dramas yet staged
at that popular playhouse. The plot is
superior to the average, humdrum melo
dramatic romance. While there are plen
ty of thrills and sensational incidents, ev
erything appears to be perfectly natural,
and each new incident is an unexpected
turn in the career of the play.- The story
is of a young wife, who, thinking she
is shielding her, husband, assumes the
charge of murder, and after many excit
ing adventures and numerous complica
tions, is finally cleared, and to her relief,
the murderer proves to be other than
her husband. An extremely original and
sensational scene occurs in the second act,
in which is pictured a rather cheerful
thieves' den, to which the young wife has
been lured. A young country yokel hap
pens in, drugs the inmates and rescues
the charming heroine with very little ef
fort and with none of the life and death
struggle usually depicted In such scenes.
Hallett Thompson departs from his usual
line and is very clever in his delineation
of a raw country boy. Stanley Ross, as
usual, earned the hisses of the gallery as
the misguided son. and Willard Blackmore
was strong as Clarence Douglas, the
adopted son. Annette Marshall had a lot
to do as the young, wife, and she showed
to splendid advantage. The character
roles were well sustained by" Messrs. Cor
rigan and Emery and Margaret Marshall.
The entire performance was excellent,
and the audience appeared to be well
pleased. "An African King" will be next
week's attraction.' Â¦
Central.
clever and well-balanced company. It is
some time since the comedy was given
here before, but it will be remembered
that it hinges upon the introduction of a
rogue by means of supposed clairvoyant
power into society circles In London. He
â¢nnally induces his Belgravian acquaint
ances to take shares in one of the wild
cat schemes that nourished for a time
and ruined or nearly ruined many aristo
cratic families. The rogue's son has been
taken from him when a boy and has been
educated by an aunt. He finally become
a barrister and falls in love with the
daughter of a knight, but the consent to
their marriage Is withheld till he can
prove that his parentage Is honorable. He
takes it upon himself to expose the rogue,
which forms the keynbte of the plot, and
is kept blissfully ignorant of the fact that
the said rogue is his own father. Some
of the situations are intensely interesting
and dramatic, and the final scene between
rather and son is powerfully worked up.
M. L. Alsop as Bailey Prothero, the rogue
gave a masterful and thoroughly con
vincing portrayal of the part and proved
that he is capable of big things. His love
and tenderness for his wife In good and
111 fortune were shown with rare art and
expression. Henry Shumer as the son

i fc :'T18 Market Street.- BtONDON, Feb. 10.â In the House of
Commons to-day War Secretary Brod
rick confirmed the report that . the Gov
ernment had decided to withdraw the
British troops at Wei-Hai-Wei and to pro
ceed no further with building fortifica
tions at that place. . /.:, 'Â«-.
In the House of Lords the Under Sec
retary for the Colonial Office, Lord On
slow, referring to the Government's in
tention to withdraw the British troops
from Wel-Hal-Wei, added the information
that the Government had no intention of
giving up so valuable a colony as Wei-
Hai-Wei. It was extremely useful as a
small-arms store, for gunning practice
and as a sanitarium. The naval and mil
itary officials there had every reason to
believe Wei-Hai-Wei would become in
creasingly useful and valuable.
The. Chinese regiment at Wei-Hai-Wel
would be I gradually disbanded. It had
been found that the position could only
be fortified at a great expense. The Co
lonial Office took over the administration
of the place January 1. The rumors that
Wei-Hai-Wei would be returned to-- China
or handed over to .any other, powet were
entirely unfounded. The decision had been
reached from Â¦ the view-point of naval
strategy, and there had been an extraor
dinary consensus of naval cpinlon'in: favor
of the course adopted. : ..." J .
The bill further provides imprisonment
not exceding ten years for all who threat

and authorizes* the Secretary of War to
detail a guard from the army to protect

features from that reported last week by
the. House Committee on Judiciary, but
Its purpose and penalties are the same,
and there is little 'doubt that the two
houses will be able to reach a" prompt
agreement.
The Senate Committee on Judiciary to
day authorized Senator' Hoar to report
the bill prescribing the death penalty for
all persons who shall attempt the life of

The Idea of private ownership in water apart
from land cannot prevail without creating In
stitutions essentially feudal in " character. To
give- to companies or individuals the control
of " streams and make the farmers who use
those streams dependent for their lights on the
conditions which the companies Impose in pri
vate . contracts. Is to make the water company
the practical owner of the land it serves and
the irrigator and farmer a tenant. A propo
sition which would contemplate turning: over
all the land of the West to private monopo-'
ltes ajid making those who have homes upon It
Â¦â¢dependent upon these monopolies would not
command popular supjxirt, but the Idea/of* pri
vate ownership In water, amounting tola vlr-'
tual monopoly of this vital element, has been
permitted to grow up In some sections; of the
West. .To a certain extent It has obtained rec
ognition in leclKlation and protection , In .Judi

The report deals at considerable length
with agricultural and engineering prob
lems,, legal and social problems, irrigation
laws aad the organization of irrigation
industries. Regarding water rights, the
report says: , . Â¦*
The work in this region has followed two
general lines â agricultural and { engineering,
legal and social. Of these the legal and social
problems- present' the greatest difficulties and
stand most in need of an early solution. The
success -of irrigated agriculture in this region
requires, first of all, the creation of institu
tions which shall offer a Just and adequate
foundation for future development. Such a
foundation requires that the users' right to
streams must be clearly defined in order that
those who now use streams and those who ex
pect to use them may understand how much
of the' water supply Is appropriated and how
much remains open to appropriation. The liti
gation and controversy which now menace com
munities, and which are a constant source of
anxiety and loss to irrlgators, should be brought
to an end. In order to effect these desirable
reforms a knowledge of certain essential facts
is required. Among those are the quantity of
water required to grow crops, the losses from
seepage and evaporation In distribution, the
character of the control over streams already
vested and the kind of administrative meas
ures needed to Insure ', effective divisions of
streams among the multitude of users who de
pend thereon. Specific information along these
Iine3 is indispenslble to wl6e and effective
action in the future either by the Government
or by individuals. It is the information which
should have been gathered at the outset of
this development, but the long delay In its
collection renders it all" the more urgent that
it be carried on now to an early and effective
completion. .
Users' Bights Must Be Defined.
The humid region, as generally described, in
cludes all of the United States westward to a
line which would cross Nebraska and Kansas
about half way between their eastern and west
ern bordere. The sub-humid region lies be
tween the humid and arid regions, .extending
from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada, and Includ
ing- irregular areas in the different Pacific
Coast States, while the arid region includes all
the territory lying west of the eastern eub
humld belt, with a considerable exception along
the Pacific Coast, and with .smaller local areas
In each of the arid States. Irrigation is em
ployed as an aid to agriculture In all of these
regions. It is a necessity in the arid region,
of great value in the sub-humid district and Is
proving highly profitable in .the growing of
certain crops in the humid region. There are
also large areas in the, recently acquired insu
lar possessions of the United States where irri
gation is required, and where the value of the
products permits of a large outlay to provide
for its use. The greater part of the Irrigation
work of this office has been carried on in the
region where farming is impossible without the
artificial application of water to crops. This
includes* all of the Territories of Arizona and
New Mexico, the States or Colorado, Utah,
Nevada, Montana and Wyoming, and large
parts of California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho,
North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kan
sas and Texas. The greater* attention paid to
the problems of this section of the country is
justified by the fact that here irrigation, is a
necessity rather than a valuable adjunct to
agriculture. It measures agricultural settle
ment and very largely controls the develop
ment of other industries, because both the cost
and. comfort of living are very largely deter
mined by the production of a- home food sup
ply. In the regions further east the adoption
of irrigation is determined by whether or not
it will Improve conditions already favorable,
but Jn the arid region it ie the choice between
civilization and desert conditions..
'""CALL'BUBEAU, 1406 Q STREET.- N..
W., WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â Elwbod
Mead, irrigation expert in charge, of the
office of experiment stations, has filed a
lengthy report with the Secretary of the
Interior on. the scope and purpose of the
irrigation investigations. With relation to
rainfall, Expert Mead says the -territory
of" the. United States is divided Into three
divisions â the humid, the sub-humid and
the arid. Geographically these regions
are arranged from east to west, although
no exact line can be drawn separating
them. -.The report says: - - ;
Ejjeclal Dispatch to The Call.
When this principle Is adopted, the control of
;water is divided like the control of land among
a multitude of proprietors; water monopoly Is
impossible, and : no other abuse or injustice
is encouraged. Years of experience In other
lands and the limited experience of this coun
try have abundantly proven that peaceful and
orderly development cannot be realized except
as water and land are united in one ownership
and canals treated as public or seml-publlc
utilities rather than as a means of fastening
a vicious monopoly upon communities.
After referring at great length to lrri-'
gatlon in the humid portions of the United
States, and in -the Insular possessions of
the United States, the report concludes:
It Is impossible for Congress to legislate re
garding water rights "within States without
revolutionizing existing conditions in some of
the States and without Interfering with vested
rights. A commission could determine what
proportion of a stream should flow down from
the State above to the State below and leave It
to the authorities of the State above to deter
mine what measures Ehall be taken to accom
plish this result, and to the authorities of the
State below to determine what shall be done
with the water when they receive it Jn this
way there would be no Interference with vest
ed rights or with State codes of laws, while
at the same time there would be a far better
prospect of securing a Just and effective divis
ion of the supply than through Interstate liti
gation.
Congressional Aid Is Required.

"The disaster which to-day has befallen
the City. Savings Bank Is the result of
criminal irregularities confined entirely to
that institution- and caused by the rash
speculation of its vice president, who con
trolled the management and, betrayed his
trust. The bank has been expelled from
the association. .The officers of this asso
ciation desire to state to the public that
there is no need of apprehension regard
ing any other, bank in the city. The pres
ent condition of the banks, as shown by
the weekly statements furnished the
Clearing-house, reveals . an unusually
strong showing in reserve and cash re
sources, and the fair name and .'good rep
utation of the banks of Detroit will not
suffer by this trouble."
There was nothing like a panic at any
of the other banks in this city, and com
paratively. few deposits were withdrawn
as a result of the excitement At the
Gratiot-avenue branch of the City Sav
ings Bank, which drew its deposits large
ly from the laboring people, i there were
pathetic scenes as the depositors learned
that the bank had suspended.- Policemen
were in the, vicinity to quell any disorder,

SALT LAKE. Utah, Feb. 10.â The sus
pension of the City Savings Bank of De
troit has resulted in the closing down of
operations at two prominent Utah minesâ
the Ophir at Statellne and the Tiewaukee
at Bingham. F. C. Andrews, vice presi
dent of the suspended Detroit Bank, was
heavily interested in these properties,
both of which are considered valuable.
The close-down will be temporary.
At a meeting of the Clearing-house As
sociation this afternoon the following
statement on the suspended institution
was issued: â¢ -
Criminal Irregularities.
"F. C. Andrews would draw a check in
the amount, he wantedland have it cer
tified by the cashier, Henry R. .Andrews.
He would present this certified check to
the person with whom he was doing
business and ask him to hold it out for
that day, as the bank ' was not in funds
to meet it. Perhaps he would thus hold
it out' for two or three days, and eventu
ally, when there was . money enough in
the bank to meet the check, he would
go in and take.it out. There would be
only a slip of paper in . the drawer, - and
the withdrawal would be put down as a
cash item. With this money he would
in person pay the certified check ' and
tear it up. This . -was done time and
again." . ;
The City Savings Bank was the depos
itory for the. funds of the County Audit
ors, their balance there being more than
$150,000, and F. C- Andrews was arrested
this afternoon on a complaint sworn out
by* Auditor Christian after a long confer
ence betwen the Auditors and Prosecutor
Hunt. The warrant was served on An
drews, who Is Commissioner of Police, by
two of his detectives in the office of the
Detroit Trust Company, where he had
been in consultation with officers of the
banks holding his certified checks. The
City Savings Bank was also the deposi
tory for the Board of Education, which
had a total of $467,000 on deposit. . Other
local banks will temporarily advance
funds to the Board of Education for sal
aries and running expenses.
How Andrews Operated.
As soon as Commissioner Maltz took
charge ot the institution he. began an
examination of its books. It waa found
that Cashier Andrews had permitted F.
C. Andrews to overdraw his account
$yl4,000. Other liabilities brought F. C.
Andrews' total indebtedness to the bank
up to $1,158,000. ' In audition to this Cash
ier Andrews had certified to . checks for
F. C. Andrews, â¢ which he had deposited
in banks, to the amount of *662,ouO. At
the close of his examination Commis
sioner Maltz to-night issued the follow
ing statement of trie bank's condition at
the close of business February- 8:
Resources â Total loans and discounts,
bonds, mortgages and securities, $2,363,
093; overdrafts, $913,853; real estate, $10,889;
cash in banks, *288,697; other assets,
$18,922. Â¦
Liabilitiesâ Stock, surplus and undivid
ed profits, $225,212; deposits.- $3,370,251.
The' examination showed that the rec
ord of F. C. Andrews' transactions was
not kept in the regular way, but in a
memorandum book. The first record of a
transaction between Cashier Andrews
and F. G. Andrews is January ; 11, but-the
examiners estimate that the transactions
have been going on for about- six weeks.
President F. C. Pingree explained the
maner in which the certified checks were
obtained, as follows: - . .

' Besides these there were buildings about
the City Hall and vicinity as offices, the
losses on which will foot up to about a
million dollars.
Mayor Â¦ Hinchliffe said to-night that he
thought the loss would reach at least $8,
000,000. Absolutely no list of the losses,
even an estimate, has been made up -for
the section east of the Erie Railroad.

the business section. It is Approximately
correct.- It does not, however, take into

Loss Is Eight Millions.
The work of clearing up' the burned dis
trict has not begun; but the firemen were
busy until night with repairers and dyna
mite, tearing down the shaky walls that
endangered those who had to be inside
the burned area. So well did this work
progress that in the afternoon the public
was permitted in the ruins and sentries
were posted - at those important .points,
keeping the crowd moving. Thousands
passed about the choked -up streets and
reviewed the ruins during the two hours
and a half allowed them. At the expira
tion of the time the sentries in. the center
of. the section began moving outward and
gathering up the extra men at each step,
sopn had the entire section cleared. ; , ,
Burled beneath the ruins of ' the City
Hall were found the safes'- which -be
longed to the Controller's office, and; aldo
the -papers, legal documents and public
records -were found. unharmed. . The safes
of the Passalc "Water Company", r under
the. ruins of the building which stood at
107, and; 109. Washington street, 'were de
stroyed and the only part of their con
tents recovered was $500 in silver. J
The greatest tangle In city affairs will
be in the Tax Office. So far as can be
ascertained, Â¦ the records of . the depart
ment are destroyed. â¢ There is a set of
books which shows. the valuation,- etc.. of
each piece of property in the city, and
the Assessors have their field books, from
which all this could be duplicated with
out overmuch work. 'It is said, however,
that it is almost certain the records
showing. who paid their taxes and who
had not are destroyed, and that there is
not in existence anything from which the
information could be obtained.
Money and securities said to amount to
$3,000,000* were recovered from the . two

Some people have suffered with
rheumatism many years of their life
and get no relief from â¢doctors' pre-
scriptions and advertised c-res. But
Halpruner's Wonderful Medicine is
certainly remarkable in cases of . rheu-
matism, as the following: letter from
a young lady in . Oregon certainly
proves. She suffered for nearly eleven
years with muscular rheumatism with-
out any relief until she tried Hai-
pruner's Wonderful Medicine â two
bottles, costing $2, cured- her. - and she
was glad to say so: _, .
Having suffered terribly with muscular
and Inflammatory . rheumatism for. about
eleven years, and last January I had It
bo bad I could hardly walk. But through
the advice of my uncle I sent to Dr. Hal-
pruner for some of his wonderful rheu-
matism medicine. He sent me two II
bottles, which I have taken Internally
as per directions. My rheumatism has all
disappeared, and I feel thoroughly cured.
My advice to any person :who may be suf-
fering with rheumatism 1e to purchase
Dr. Halpruner's wonderful medicine from
their druggist and use it strictly accord-
ing to directions, and it will positively
cure them. You are welcome to use this
Wter if It will be of any benefit. Very

MILEAGEâ E. T.. City. The first Con
gress provided that each member should
receive, besides his pay, $6 for each twen
ty miles traveled going and returning in
1818 this was raised to $8. An act of 1S56
limited this to two sessions. In 1866 the
railroad having long since come in the
mileage was reduced to 20 cents a mile.
On the 22d of December, 1848, Horace
Greeley published in the Tribune a state
ment that the Government was being de
frauded on mileage in large sums the
amount in excess of legitimate charges
for the thirtieth Congress being vnSs*
While this expose caused considerable
ill feeling against him, it led to a revision
of the mileage matter and the abolition
of constructive mileage. This clasa of
mileage was an allowance for journeys
merely supposed to have been made, as
when Congress adjourns and a new Presi
dent takes Office or an: extra session is
called.

SAND BLASTâ R. H. G.. City The
front of the house on California street
asked about Is being cleaned by means of
what is known as the sand blast. A lanre
quantity of well dried sand is forced
through a pipe by means of a fan blower
revolving at the rate of about 2000 times
a minute. This sand striking the stone
removes all the dirt and leaves the stone
as clean as when it came from the stone
cutter's hands'. In thus cleaning stone
care has to be taken that the force of
the blast be distributed evenly, as if left
too long in one position it would burrow
holes or make Indentations in tlv, Atone

The clever inventor of the new method
is a native of Oakdale, and the son of
the Rev. >D. S. Stuart. HU line of sub
ject ranges from .landscape to fruit paint
ing, where the method Is equally well
used, says the Chicago enthusiast. He
has painted much in Alaska and in the
Yellowstone Park, and believes very thor
oughly in .the surpassing beauty of Amer
ican scenery.
The critic then explains the many vir
tues of aluminum as opposed to canvas,
and tells how the inventor subjected com
pleted pictures to the severest tests that
could be devised, placing one on a steam
radiator until it was almost redhot, then
throwing it Into a snowdrift, where it
was allowed to remain for- days, without
any apparent damage. Besides the ques
tion of permanence, Fox seems to think
that the artist has forever settled the
question of\an artistic base for oil palnt
ing-. He says the artistic effect produced
by the use of aluminum as a base shows
"a result so far beyond the range of pos
sibilities on canvas that no comparisons
can be drawn." r: ;; VV: ' , : 'J, : '^:
"Aluminum is imperishable; It Is non
corrosive, subject to none of the decay-
Ing characteristics of all other base met
als. It will endure until the 'heavens are
rolled in a scroll and the earth rocks on
its axis' at the day of doom. Canvas, at
best, is fragile, easily destroyed and is
highly susceptible to the atmospheric
conditionsâ moisture, which expands, and
heat, which contracts. By the never end
ing expansion and contraction operation,
to which every - canvas is subjected, the
rarest works of art. fall into decay and
must be restored or renovated from time
to time."
"J. Everett Stuart, a landscape painter
of rare genius, whose work is known
throughout the entire United States and
many of the leading European cities, has
uncovered an exhibition of marvelous
paintings done on aluminum.
A recent. copy of the. Chicago Times
devotes a column and a half to the in
vention of J. E. Stuart, a Calif ornlan art
ist, whereby the use .of aluminum as a
substitute for canvas .in oil painting has
been perfected. The Chicago critic, Fen
ton S. Fox^ waxes very enthusiastic over
the possibilities of the discovery. He
says in part:
"An imperishable art; an art that Is
destined to immortalize its creator; an
art so wonderful in its conception, treat
ment and far-reaching possibilities that
the critics are dumb with amazement and
artists stand aghast with envy or inca
pability to comprehend, has recently, come
to light In Chicago.

r Â¦ aerial tower proposed for the St. Louis Exposition
1 is said to be a combination of the Eiffel Tower, the cap-
I tive balloon and the Ferris wheel all in one, with many
- features added.
. -.-Â¦.' The tower Â¦ consists of-two towers of steel. One of
them will be 200 feet in height, at the top of which is a plat
form 100 feet in diameter, capable of accommodating many
hundreds of people. The second platform will be 150 feet
from the ground- and 80 feet in diameter. The lower platform
will 'be- 10O feet -'from the ground and 70 -feet, in diameter.
Each landing, or platform, will be "encircled by a safety railing
three and one-half '. feet in height. A spiral stairway runs
from the bottom to the top of the main tower. The landing
at- the top will be covered with a waterproof canvas in the
form of a, circus tent. People on cither of these landings can
see for miles in any direction and set a good view of thÂ«
fair grounds and buildings.
To one side of the main tower is a second structure of steel,
on. the top of which works a monster steel walking beam.
To one end is attached a car, square in shape, with a capacity
for fifty people, while just above the car is a representation
of a captive balloon. To the other end of the beam Is at
tached a double cable, which connects with an engine at tha
base of the tower. As the engine winds up this cable it ele->
vatesthe balloon car until it reaches the top landing of the
main tower, when the gates are thrown open and unloaded.
People may return by the car or they may descend . by' tha
stairway and get the view from each of the lower landings.

The people of New York are^clamoring for a cop
per coin of the value of 2^ cents. The argument is
that two railroad fares across Brooklyn bridge are

loss on each trip of a half cent, and as the numBer

Yorkers argue that the need of the new coin is a
matter of urgency.
A French newspaper published in the French col
ony of Pondicherry is reported to have recently an
nounced to its readers that General Buller had been
captured by the Boers, and went on to add: "Generaf
Buller stood in a humble and suppliant attitude be
fore General Dewet. Greatly moved by this heart
rending scene, General Dewet, who looked like God
himself, asked Buller if he had anything to say.
General Buller replied in these words: 'Sir, I am a
poor man. I entangled myself in this war owing to
my inability to bear the worry of the British Govern
ment. Grant me my life and I will go.' " -That is
fully as good as anything American yellow journal
ism ever did in the way of interviewing the Pope or
the Emperor of China.
Another speaker, Surgeon-Major Ince, declared
that modern sanitation and sanitary inspection is one
of the greatest Plagues, of the age. "Look," he said,
"at all the persecution the people have inflicted upon
them in regard to water, and yet there is not a
drop of pure water on the earth; not even rain-water
is pure." The most interesting statement of all, how
ever, was that of Sir George Birdwood,K. C. I. E.,
who served many years in India, and who declared
that in India the man, attacked by disease is endan
gered not so much by the virulence of his complaint
or by the lack of cleanliness as by the climate, "which
gave no fair chance for rallying. "India's chief hope,"
he said, "lies in effective nursing."- He went on to
say. that the Indian people have their own methods of
Some of the statements made by the speakers are
decidedly interesting. Dr. Forbs Ross denounced the
doctrine' of personal cleanliness as an assurance of
health and immunity^from diseasj, and told how,
many years ago, in a Yorkshire mining -village, he,
having been vaccinated, undertook to keep dirty for
three months while attending his smallpox patients.
He touched no water, except to drink it, did not
change his clothes even at nightâ the miners setting
a watch upon him. .He spent thus the most horrible
three months he had ever experienced; but he proved
his point.
It is not many years,ago since a plea of that, kind
would have received unanimous sanction from such
a body of learned British doctors as that which com
posed Dr. Dhingra's audience. In this instance, how
ever, it appears that not a single one of the speakers
who-discussed the paper agreed with the writer.
The change of medical opinion on the subject was
recently manifested by a discussion at the Imperial
Institute in London on "Indian Sanitation." A paper
on that subject was -read before the National Indian
Association by Dr. Dhingra, a Hindu, who had taken
his degree of .M. D. at- the University of Edinburgh.
The doctor, we are told by the London Chronicle'
in' an account of the proceedings, "is an enthusiastic
sanitarian, and urged extensive reforms in the direc
tion of pure water and a better drainage system for
India." His plea was that by cleanliness alone could
the people of India be saved from the innumerable
diseases and frequent plagues that afflict them.
â¢~> INCE the dissemination of the "germ theory of
disease" the old doctrine that disease is the
product of filth has been largely abandoned.
Investigators have discovered that disease germs are
not always found where filth abounds, nor are they
always absent where cleanliness prevails. Conse
quently while sanitation in the way of cleanliness is
still upheld as a valuable thing in itself, it is no longer
regarded as a sure preventive against most of the
diseases that flesh is heir to. %
WHERE DOCTORS DIFFER.
; The problem is one of difficulty. Climatic condi
tions are not to be avoided, and in the" East those
conditions are 'formidable. American - ingenuity can
doubtless find a right solution for- the problem,
though it may take 'years to do so;< While waiting
for that solution our Eastern friends must bear "up
against winds and fires as best they, can, or, what is
better, come to j California . arid live where no such
climatic complexities threaten them with disaster.,
The New York Press argues that it will be diffi
cult to devise a fireproof method "of homc : building
that will suit: the climate of the Atlantic States. It
says: "If we haveindestructibility'in winter we have
uninhabitability in summer, and ivice versa. The
only .'houses and shops which would resist a fire
started in a seventy-five-mile gale in a winter night,
with the mercury below freezing, and the air as dry as
sarid t are solid stonei And solid stone houses will
not be built by a people who have tropical conditions
to consider for part of their year. Indeed, they will
be built nowhere save by people who intend to oc
cupy them from generation to generation." '
The frequency of such fires has of; course brought
about a discussion as to the best means of preventing
them. The first demand, of course, is .for the con
struction of buildings better fitted to withstand fire.
No one, however, has been able to suggest a means
of providingfor such structures. In many cases the
buildings destroyed in Paterson were deemed to be
fairly fireproof, but in the raging "flames these were
swept away along with the rest and the fire stopped
only when it reached an open space, where there was
no fuel for it to feed' on. Â¦ : ' \ ''
BLIZZARDS have not been so disastrous in the
: - East this year as fires. In that section of the
country the record, looks as if this were to be
a year of conflagrations. In addition to the many
serious cases of the destruction of notable -buildings
or groups of houses here and there we have had the
wholesale destruction of the business portion 6f the
town of Waterbury, in- Connecticut, ''a few days ago,
and now there is added the destruction of a large sec
tion' of Paterson, New Jersey.
In each of these latter cases the fires were accom
panied by fierce winter gales, thewind blowing like
a hurricane. The Fire Departments were- unable to
combat the' combined elements. The .flames spread
with. rapidity, and property to. the value of many mil
lions of dollars was. swept *a way in a night.
FIRES IN THE EAST.
Although William C. Whitney has announced his
retirement from politics as well as from business it
will be just as well for New York politicians to keep
an eye on him. Sometimes the most retired back
rooms have a good many push buttons that set live
wires a-moving.
The arrest of Senator Beveridge's valet for rob
bing his employer has somewhat startled the blue
jeans people of Indiana, who never dreamed that
their junior Senator had a valet, and. a_ good many of
them are wondering what kind of an animal it is.
Despite all the rumors of a possible postponement
the St. Louis managers have seemingly determined to
hold their exposition next year, consequently there is
now very little time tc make ready a comprehensive
exhibit. There is certainly no time to lose. What
ever is to be done at all should be done promptly.
California's exhibit should be made ready at once,
and San Francisco should act the part of a progres
sive metropolis in helping to provide it
Reports from the interior are to the effect that the
counties as a rule are acting energetically in the mat
ter. Their efforts, however, will of necessity be con
fined to making an exhibit of the local products.
What is needed is a leadership that will bring all
these separate activities into harmony and combina
tion. That work has been undertaken by the State
Board of Trade and has been well planned. It is
now the duty and will be to the interest of San Fran
cisco to give cordial and effective help to the enter
prise. * The upbuilding of the State is essential to the
growth of the city. Our merchants, manufacturers,
capitalists and property-owners can well afford to be
liberal in contributing to this undertaking, for every
dollar they expend in advertising the State and at
tracting settlers will be like bread cast upon the wa
ters, which will surely be returned with, abundant
profit later on.
commemorate, interest in the fair is very great, and it
is assured that their displays will be exceptionally
excellent. While none of these States can be ac
counted a rival to California in climate or in produc
tiveness, they are nevertheless rivals of our efforts to
obtain homeseekers Ziiid settlers, and accordingly it
behooves us to make cur State display thoroughly
representative of our resources and our industries.
ALL reports from the East tend to' the conclu
sion that the State exhibits at the St. Louis
exposition will be far superior to any that
have ever been made, not even excepting those at the
Chicago exposition. In all the States that have been
erected from the original Louisiana territory, whose
acquisition by the United States the exposition is to

The demand for a national gallery is perhaps- not
great, but none the les's,such'a: storehouse 'of Ameri
can art should; be provided. "\ ; We have already; ac
complished much'in. every; branch of artistic, work,
and it is but fitting v that 'tlie'-, nation should at its capi
tal have an exhibition: of what has been accomplished.
The great galleries of Europe are amohg-'the most
precious possessions" o|^the^ nations. ',' A" similar "gal
lery at Washington would",be equally valuable to us.
In fact,* if we begin nowj we can' make a completes
collection of American art, showing, all"iphases'.of its
development, than is'possessed'by -any.'.other -country
of its art work. For many reasons, tKcn, the national
gallery bill deserves the support of Congress. -It has
unquestionably the; approval of all. the people who
care anything about art. j,
The one danger of such a gallery, is that it-might
pass into the hands of a clique and thus be used to
sustain a small group of artists rather than to repre
sent American art as a whole.' That danger, how
ever, seems to be guarded against by a.provision in
the bill that the selection of works^ for the gallery shall
be placed in the hands "of a commission of twenty,
connoisseurs to be named by; the President, and each
to hold office for five years without ; remuneration."
Such a committee.it would seem; would be sufficient
to assure the selection. of iwork representative, of our
best art and the\rejectiori?of that which is unworthy.
The . passage of the : bill at the- present session of
Congress is doubtful, but sooner or later it, or a
similar measure,' will be enacted. V The. superb struct^
ure erected at Washington for a national library will
serve* at. once as an incentive to erect' a national ;'ar'f
gallery and as a precedent for doing so. -The people
are becoming rich arid artistic?' They are also "becom
ing more and more interested in the national capital
and more eager : to see . it . take'r rank ; "above .*. any
other capital in the world. Moreover, American art
has now reached a degree "of excellence . where â¢ it
awakens patriotic pride and where, the people ; are
quite willing to grant it a fair, share of' governmental
patronage and support. \ Â¦ - . -
AS a part of the_ general plan of those 1 improve
ments which. are expected to Â¦ make;Washing
ton, thje most-ymagnificent . city in the world,
so far as parks and buildings; go, there : has been intro
duced JhtCK the Senate., a. biJL providing for. the^conr

Do we intend to say to the Porto Ricans that they
would have been better off if we had made them in
dependent and thereby assumed the. moral obligation
to make them our cossets and feed them with a
spoon? '
The question Americans must ask is: Did
we assume an obligation to permanently prosper
Cuba and beggar Porto Rico? Did we agree to
butcher those who live under our flag and feed their
carcasses to those who don't?
We own Porto Rico. It is bone of our bone and
flesh of our flesh. The Porto Ricans have the right,
which the Cubans have not, to look to us for such
commercial incorporation into our system as will
make them sharers of our prosperity and our adver
sity. They come protesting against Cuba's demand.
They have a right to protest.
They did not have free trade with us under Spain,
and they wore diamonds. Now, independent, dis
burdened, enfranchised, they declare that they can-,
not wear shirts unless we give them what they never
had before â free entry to our -markets!
Patience with this sort of thing is becoming more
difficult with every repetition. With her indepen
dence about to be 'assumed / under a government
which she has elected, Cuba declares that she will,
be worse off than under the heel of Spain unless she
is incorporated into our commercial system, with all
the rights and privileges of our own people! "
Under Spain the isknd thrived. Her tariffs were
made for her by that kingdom. Her burden of taxa
tion wrung her withers. She had neither civil nor
religious liberty. Her judicial administration was
a travesty upon justice. Her sanitation was neg
lected. Yet her people prospered. Witness the mul
titude of Cuban millionaires, who flashed across New
York society like chameleons that had borrowed
their iridescence from the colors of the rainbow. and
the sheen of gems; who intermarried with American
social lords and ladies, and thence with 'the British
aristocracy and nobility. We have delivered them
from the incubus of which they complained.
The soil and climate that bore a crop of
diamonds and pearls for them are there 'still.
Their tobacco is incense, their sugar fit Â¦ to.
sweeten the gods' nectar. The exactions of
Spanish taxation are no more. The robberies of
the Spanish Captains General have ceased. Their
cities are sanitary and wholesome. Their judicial'
courts administer justice freely. Upon their produc
tions are the same tariffs that rested there when they
skimmed cream from their plantations under Spanish
rule. Their commercial opportunity to the world's
markets is exactly what it was then. From their pro
duction the heavy hand of Spanish need and greed
has been Hfted, and yet they tell us they will starve
and die unless we give them free trade!
The method chosen by the junta for presenting
Cuba's side. is quite another thing. .It is put forward
as a charitable duty, which we are under" moral and
political obligations to perform. Over and over again
the American people are _ told that, by the Spanish
war of liberation we agreed to insure .: the - stable
prosperity of the island. It would seem that one
refutation of this should suffice, but it does hot. The
plea is renewed, reinforced and prolonged. We are
told that it is cruelty to refuse; that this country
.will behave to Cuba worse than Spain; that we will
betray the islanders, condemn them to, starvation, do
worse than Weyler in his concentrado decree, if we
do not give them all they ask.
THE discussion of free trade with Cuba, in the
light of its economic effects upon the United
States, the weighing and measuring, matKemati-;
cally, of the tariff abatement which' beet sugar and
tobacco can stand, is one thing. About that the re
finers and beet farmers may be in accord or in dis
cord. It is a ponderable problem, capable of solu
tion, if in no other way, by a brief experience..
of sickness it is advisable to have a good nurse.
There has never been an answer to the old ques
tion: "Who shall decide .when' doctors disagree?"
We. shall have to leave the issue to the medical fra
ternity, venturing ourselves to say no more than that
it is always well to keep clean and that in every case

He maintained that the Republican lead
ers had deceived and deluded the people,
but he did not believe they could continue
to do so.
. "There will come an awakening," said
he, "and the day of awakening- is not far
distant. If I did not believe so I should
despair of my country." /
Turner then discussed In detail the at
titude of the United States toward the
Philippines under the principles of Inter
national law. He maintained under those
principles the United States had no right
In the islands and had no right to prevent
the Filipinos from setting up a free, and
Independent government. He called upon
his Republican friends, to think what a
tangled skein they have woven in the
Orient. â¢
"I conjure you," he urged, "to" unravel
that skein while there Is yet time. I con
jure you to do it not alone In. the name of
the hopeless Filipinos,- who trusted you
and whose lands you have drenched with
blood, but I. conjure you inthe. name of
80,000,000 American people and : their 1 pos
terity to stay your "hand lest; their; pre

"The leaders of the Republican party
have dishonored the nation by their greed
for power and spoils. They have done so
under the false and blasphemous pretense
that they were serving Almighty God by
advancing liberty and religion." Instead of
advancing the cause of liberty they have
struck it the worst blow it has received
since it first found a foothold on â¢ the
American continent." -
WASHINGTON, Feb. lO.-Throughout
nearly the entire session of the Senate to
day the Philippine tariff bill was under
consideration. Turner of Washington con
cluded his speech, begun last Friday, on
the legal and constitutional phase of the
Philippine question. He* held in the main
that as the Filipinos had established' an
Independent government In the islands
prior to the falling of Manila the United
States, under the principles of Interna
tional law, had no right in the islands.
Further along Turner exclaimed with
great vehemence:
Deming was a captain in the subsistence
department of the volunteer army. He
was commissioned under the act of 1899,
providing for the enlistment of soldiers
for the Philippine war. : ; The charge
against him related' to his accounts. Â«
The court-martial dismissed Deming
from- the service and -sentenced him to
three years In the penitentiary. This sen
tence was affirmed . by the Secretary . of
War and approved by the President. â¢
Deming will be released from the Fort
Leavenworth â¢Â¦ penitentiary within sixty
days, and all other former members of
the volunteer army who are confined In
Federal prisons on sentences inflicted by
courts-martial' of regular officers -will also
be liberated as the result of to-day's de
cision. It is stated E. A. Rosier, United
States District Attorney, estimates the
number of such cases at 200. I <Â¦
t The essential question, as stated in
Judge Sanborn' s opinion, is whether the
volunteer army is the: same as the reg
ular army, or whether it is one of tho
"other i forces" mentioned in article 77.
The opinion establishes the fact that the
volunteer army is at all times distinct
from the regular, army.
ST. LOUIS, Feb. 10.â Established prece
dents of the United States army were
overthrown and the freedom of nearly 200
men now confined in Federal penitenti
aries was assured by a decision rendered
by the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals to-day in the case of Peter C. Dem
ing, J a former captain of United States
volunteers, against Robert McClaughey,
warden of the. Federal' penitentiary at
Fort Ueavenworth. Deming was impris
oned on the sentence of a court-martial
composed of nine regular officers, con
vened by General W. R. Shatter on
March 29, 1900. The opinion of the Cir
cuit Court, written by Judge Walter S.
Sanborn, is that the court-martial which
sentenced Deming acted in violation of
article 77 of the Articles of War, which
provides that officers of the regular army
shall not -be competent to sit on. courts
martial for the trial of officers and sol
diers of other forces.

Spooner interrupted Teller to inquire
whether he regarded ~the acquisition of
Porto Rico as a violation of the Teller
amendment regarding Cuba. Teller said
he had not complained of the acquisition
of Porto Rico, because the people of that
island had desired it. *
"And; I do not' mean, to say," he con
tinued, "that if the 1 people of Cuba want
to have that island annexed and we want
it we cannot" annex it under: that-provis
ion. I do. say, however, that we can
not annex Cuba unless the Cubans agree
to it with unanimity."
Teller yielded: the floor for the day, and
the Senate,, at' 4:25'p. m.,- went into ex-'
ecu tlve session, and soon afterward ad
journed. 'Â¦' â¢ Â¦â¢"â¢ A Â¦ -
Teller said that In 1898 the question was
raised as to whether the constitution of
the United States by its own force went
Into operation in he Philippines. He ex
pressed an opinion hat It did not and it
could not until Congress put it there. by
a positive declaration of law. He main
tained, however, that the constitution
ought to be extended over the Philip
pines so that the inhabitants of the
Islands should have- all the protection af
forded by that -great document. ;.- . Â¦ ...
"Because I stand here with words of
sympathy for the Filipinos," said he,
"'I am not guilty of treason, as has been
charged against a Senator in this cham
ber."
Teller gave notice of an amendment de
claring, that ' it Is not Intended Â¦ by the
Government of the United States to per
manently annex the Philippine Islands as
an integral part â¢ of the United Â¦ States,
but that it is intended to establish, with
the consent and assistance of the inhab
itants thereof, a government â¢ or govern
ments suitable to their wants and condi
tions. ,
Addressing the Senate, Teller said he
was not going to be disturbed by the un
parliamentary and indecent charge made
against these who don't agree with the
administration's policy, that they are un
patriotic and have not the public's wel
fare at heart.
The discussion of the Philippine bill
was continued. Patterson of Colorado
presented an amendment providing for
the repeal of the sedition laws applied to
the Philippines. . .
When Turner concluded the House
amendment to the urgency deficiency bill
relating to the opening of State claims
was agreed to.
Turner referred to the Philippine sedi
tion act as not only unconstitutional but
as a "'relic of barbarism too black even
for the most despotic and tyrannical gov
ernment that now exists on the face of
the earth."
that of the unfortunate people devoted by
you to conquest and subjugation and
spoliation."
He denounced the Philippine Commis
sion as puppets of the executive, and de
clared that their so-called laws were not
enacted in the interests of the people of
tho islands. The commission, he said, does
only what it Is told to do by the Pres
ident and the Secretary of War.
The Lord Chief Justice held that the
objectors had no right to interpose, point
ing out that no such interference in the
crown prerogative to nominate Bishops
had been tolerated since the reign of
Henry VIII. The court suggested, how
ever, that it might be advisable to mod
ify the form of public citation in the case
of the cqnflrmation of the election of
Bishops with the view of removing the
temptation to raise objections at unsuita
ble times.

QROTON, Mass.. Feb. 10.âTheo
dore Roosevelt "Jr., the oldest
son of President Roosevelt, has
double pneumonia. Otherwise his
condition Is unchanged to-night.
The boy is seriously sick, but it Is too
early to say what the chances are for his
recovery.
This was the statement ' Issued by
George B. Cortefrou, secretary to /he
President, at 9 o'clock to-night, and it
was made after a careful examination
by Dr. Alexander Lambert, the family
physician of President Roosevelt, who ar
rived here from New York at 6 o'clock
to-night.
President and Mrs. Roosevelt spent a
long, anxious day in the infirmary, await
ing the crisis of the disease which this
morning appeared to have taken such a
strong hold of their son. The change for
the worse In the boy's condition occurred
during the night and showed itself when
the regular morning examination was
made by Drs. Shattuck and Warren. Sec
retary Cortelyou, who is the only means
of communication with the sick room,
made the announcement this morning of
the patient's serious condition, although
he said then it was hot alarming.
No Immediate Danger.
disease. He announced that the disease
had spread and involved 'both lungs.
This sudden and unfavorable turn
warned the President that the most skill
ful medical treatment was necessary and
to-night he called to the aid of Drs. Shat
tuck and Warren his family physician,
BERLIN, Feb. 10.â Prince Henry of
Prussia came with Emperor William from
Potsdam this morning. Tuesday evening
his Majesty will give a dinner in honor
of Prince Henry and his suite, at which
the United States Embassador will be
present. After the Emperor's farewell to
his brother, Prince Henry will leave Ber
lin on the midnight train for Kiel. He
will stay there until Monday morning and
then go to Bremerhaven. On arriving
there he will go on board the Kronprinz
Wilhelm. With the exception of mount-
Ing a guard of honor at the wharf and
firing a salute by the forts, the Prince's
departure will be the suraa as that of any
other traveler. Emperor William and
Prince Henry this morning expressed
concern at the news of the illness of
President Roosevelt's son and received
from Dr. Holleben, the German Embas
sador at Washington, reassuring replies
to their messages of Inquiry.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â Unless there
shall be a decided change for the better
in the condition of the President's son
before the end of the present week it Is
probable that Prince Henry of Prussia
may be impelled to defer his visit to the
United States until later in the year.
May Delay Prince's Visit.
Dr. Alexander Lambert of New York, an
eminent practitioner and a man well ac
quainted with the boy's physique. The
decision to call Dr. Lambert was made
after consultation of the physicians and
the President, and the doctor left Now
York at noon, arriving here shortly after
6 o'.clock.
One theory to account for the flood Is
that the bottom of Castle Lake suddenly
dropped out through a subterranean pas
sage, and that the waters of that big
body were hurled against the natural
dam In the gorge. A party left Dunsmulr
to-day to visit the lake and learn if this
theory Is correct. Spectators declare
that the wall of water was ten feet high
as It came rushing down the mountain
side. *
The heaviest losers are: S. H. "Depew,
foreman of the machine 6hops; Frank
Hollis, engineer; George Scherer, mer
chant; Frank Taimadge, restaurant-keep
er; A. S. Griffiths, assistant depot agent;
\V. L. Maxey and Jeff Creason, brakemen.
At noon to-day a crew began blasting
out the gulch to the south and to-night
nearly all the water is going that way.
The lake Is almost emptied. Some of the
owners will remove their demolished
homes without an effort to save anything
but keepsakes. Some of the dwellings can
be rebuilt.
Blasting a "Watercourse.
The volume of water struck the wagon
bridge over the river and badly wrenched
It. The wagon road was torn up and
trees and rocks were deposited upon the
railway track. The torrent- crossed the
mains of the Champion Water Company
and tore them out of the ground, as it
did many sewer pipes. All night long the
flood continued.
There was no time to .remove any of
the contents. The water was thick with
soli and the mud settled more than fif
teen inches deep in the "houses.
People living in the south end of town
were startled by a dull, ominous roar just
at twilight last evening and almost im
mediately a sheet of water came bound
ing over the ridge a hundred yards above
their homes. They ran through the first
waters of the flood and reached higher
ground, drenched but safe. In five min
utes the water had risen to the floor level
and was sweeping through the houses
and on across the road and the railroad
track into the river.
The great barrier up the gorge had .sud
denly given away. The flood parted at
the crest of the ridge and half went down
a gulch to the south, else the dozen
houses in a line toward the river must
have been swept away. One collapsed, a
half dozen were torn from their founda
tions and one was whirled completely
around.
Residents Run for Life.
It has rained almost constantly for a
week here. No fear of flood . was enter
tained, for the main part of town clus
ters on the west slope of the canyon, well
above the raging Sacramento River.
From the south end of town a deep, nar
row gorge runs back Â¦westward for miles.
A' tiny creek threads its way ' through
this gorge. During a storm earlier in the
season an overhanging promontory two
miles above the town crashed down Into
the gorge, blocking it. Back of this nat
ural dam the water had been gathering.
During the last week of rain it increased
to a great lake.
DUXSMUIR, Feb. 10.â It Is doubtful If
$30,000 will cover the loss which residents
of the oouth end of Dunsmuir suffered
last evening and this morning from
an unexpected torrent from, the moun
tains, and they are grateful that their
lives as well as their property were not
lost in the disaster. Ten families are
homeless and some of the dwellings and
their contents, ruined by water and burled
in mud, cannot be reconstructed into hab
itations. Across lawns are stretched great
pine trees which yesterday stood high up
the mountain side. One house has a hole
through it as though made by a mighty
cannon ball and the two-ton boulder that
did the damage is now wedged In the
front gate. The water, system which sup
plied many houses is badly damaged and
the Supervisors must ask for bids for
building an entirely new road\ into the

EXPENSES HIGH
IN PHILIPPINES
Governor Taft Says That
the Salary Paid Him
Is Earned. '
Cost of Living and Enter
taining Is Greater Than
*- in America.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â In continuing
his statement concerning conditions in the
Philippines before the Senate Committee
on the Philippines to-day Governor Taft
said that the Â»estimate for preliminary ex
penses in those Islands must include a
considerable outlay for school buildings.
It was necessary, he said, to make sal
aries from 20 to 25 per cent higher than in
the United States. In this connection Sen
ator Culberson made inquiries concerning
the salaries and allowances of the Com
missioners of the archipelago.
Is each of the commissioners paid $20,000?
he asked. < ' ; â¢ Â» -â¢" â¢
No, was the reply. "When we first went out
the commissioners were each paid 510,000 and
the chairman $12,000, and In addition there
was an allowance of J5500 to each 1 or ex
penses, making the total $15,600 and $17,500
respectively. "When I was appointed civil gov
ernor I was allowed Â§5000 for my legislative
duties and $15,000 for my duties as an ex
ecutive, making $20,000. The other commis
sioners were allowed $5000 for the legislative
services and $10,000 for the executive duties,
making $15,000, all In sold.
Is each allowed a private secretary?
Yes.
And you also have a large clerical force?
Â¦ -You would think so if you should fctep Into
our offices; you also would get an Idea of the
Â¦ necessity for such a force.
! rSVhat other allowances are made?
f None except that I am allowed as governor
to live in the Malacanan, the old governor
ceneral's palace.
v '.Is it an extensive Â©lace?
. Rather. It costs me $125 in gold per month
to light it and I pay $3000 a year out of my
own pocket for servant hire. There are four
teen ponies in the stable, eight of which I
own and I also keep three carriages. The
grounds are extensive, but they are lighted
by the city of Manila as any other park
would be.
. Are the other members of the commission
provided with residences?
They are not. All of them pay rent and I
can assure you that I would much prefer to
pay mine to being required to live at Mala
canan and keep up that establishment. If I
may be allowed a word personally I would
say that of my $17,500 salary last year I
had only $1500 left at the end of the year.
and I am sure that If my illness had not
prevented my entertaining to a desirable ex
tent there would have been nothing left of
the $20,000 now paid. General Wrisht and
General Ide have assured me they could save
nothing. There Is much entertaining neces
sary and the cost of everything Is greater
than In Washington. Indeed, money goes so
fast there that it seems to melt. There are
no perquisites or allowances other than those
I have mentioned.
Governor Taft added that the commis
sion had nothing to do with fixing the
salaries of its own members, that being
done in Washington, but he said it was
impossible to secure tne services of com
petent men for responsible positions with
out paying better salaries than are paid
here.

The idea of the Ogden-Lucin cut-off
originated with the late C. P. Huntington,
who was president of the Southern Pa
cific. The construction of this line will
necessitate the building of many miles of
trestle over the lake, but will result In
shortening the road some forty miles and
the elimination of the heaviest Â¦ grades
along the entire route.
Kruttschnitt Is quoted as informing the
committee that the advantages and dis
advantages of both routes had been thor
oughly studied by Â»the company's en
gineers and that they had finally reported
in favor of the Ogden-Lucin route. Earlier
in the day the railroad officials met a
number of representative business men
of Ogd,en in that city and heard state
ments favoring the Lucin cut-off.

the Southern Pacific, Chief Engineer Ber
ry of the Union Pacific and Chief En
gineer Hood of the Southern Pacific. At
the TOeeting, which was arranged by
Kruttschnitt at the request of the Com
mercial Club, arguments were presented
by the business men of this- city favoring
the construction by the Southern Pacific
Company of a line around the south shore
of the Great Salt Lake instead of via the
contemplated Ogden-Lucin cut-off. Among
the arguments presented in favor of mak
ing this city the terminus of the Southern
Pacific were the commercial importance
of Salt Lake and the engineering difficul
ties to be overcome in building the Lucin
cut-off.

M5W YORK, Feb. 10.â William K.
Redmond, M. P.. and Joseph Devlin, the
Irish envoys, who arived on the White
Star steamship Cymric. ' were escorted
from the vessel to the Hoffman House to
day by a delegation of prominent mem
bers of various Irish societies.
Redmond is enthusiastic over the rapid
growth of the United Irish League and
did not attempt to disguise the fact that
physical force will be usÂ«d when the time
comes for an uprising in Ireland.
"When to assert their Independence the
Irish finally unite." said he. "it will be
with such force of arms as they never
have shown before. The English now real
ize the extent of our movement, and Lord
Salisbury spoke truly when he said Eng
land feared the Irisn more than she did
the Boers. They talk -of reducing our
representation of eighty in Parliament to
gixty. If they do, the sixty remaining
will make as much noise as tne eighty do
now."
On Sunday evening there will be a mass
meeting at the Academy of Music. W.
Bourke Cockran is expected to preside.
In Boston Mayor Patrick A. Collins will
be chairman.
Devlin said the league now had en
rolled 700,000 members, and he believed he
did not, exaggerate when he predicted a
membership in the near future of ten
million.
Redmond and Devlin will remain In
this city until March 2. Then they go to
Boston. From that city they will pro
ceed to Baltimore and thence to Chicago,
where there will be a monster meeting on
March 17, St. Patrick's day.
Redmond was two days late in arriving,
the Cymric being delayed by gales.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The correspondent of. the Associated
Press learns that a transcript of the diat*
patch from Dr. von Holleben, the German
Embassador at "Washington, communicat
ing the proposal of Lord Pauncefote was
sent to Emperor William immediately
after its receipt, and that the Emperor
announced his flat refusal on the margin.
The correspondent added,. "But for the
action of Emperor William, Lord Paunce
fote's proposal would have been accept
ed by the other powers."
The German Government considers that
although its attitude is no more than cor
rect it is quite unwilling that its course
should be misunderstood.
BERLIN, Feb. 10.â The official North
German Gazette this evening joins in the
controversy regarding the attitude of the
several powers previous to the outbreak
of. the Spanish-American war. It says
Lord Pauncefote's proposals April 1V1S98,
to send a collective note to the Govern
ment of the United States' declaring
American Intervention in Cuba to be un
justifiable is a historical fact, and the Ga
zette proceeds to characterize as absurd
the "attempt now being made to obscure
and dispute an event which did not occur
in the presence of the representatives of
only two powers, but on which the repre
sentatives of all the powers at Washing
ton, after reaching an agreement, report
ed to their respective governments April
.14, 1898, simultaneously and identically."
The German official declaration in the
North German Gazette is. a direct conse
quence of the incredulitjy expressed by
American and English newspapers regard
ing the disclosures from here of the ac
tion of Lord Pauncefote of April 14, 1898.
If this declaration is replied to by Great
Britain the documents relating to the
matter will undoubtedly be published. In
official circles here it is deemed best to
wait and see how the statement published
this evening in the North German Ga
zette is received.

NEW TORK, Feb. 10.â The trial of Al
bert T. Patrick, accused of the murder
of William Marsh Rice, which was inter
rupted last week by the Illness of a juror,
was resumed to-day. When court was
adjourned last Tuesday Dr. H. B. Loom
is, a pathological expert, waa on the
stand and his cross-examination was con- i
tinued to-day. On direct examination he
said " the condition of Rice's lungs was
due, in his opinion, to the inhalation of
chloroform or some like irritant. The
cross-examination brought out a. number
of technical points concerning the effects
of chloroform on the blood. On redirect
examination the witness said he knew of
no natural cause of death that could
have caused the symptoms shown by the
autopsies on Rice's body.
While Loomis was not prepared to say
that Rioe did not die of disease, he as
serteci that the examination he made did
not disclose any disease. 'Â¦ . ,
Max Hunke, who made the fluid used in
embalming Rice's body, testified that the
fluid did not contain, mercury, v Â¦ ._
John* R. Potts, a lawyer, testified that
he had known Patrick since 1870. ;. They
became" intimate In 1890. In September,
1900 the witness boarded in the same
hous* with Patrick and they had offices
in the same suite. The witness never
saw Rice in Patrick's office; in- fact, ho
never eaw Rice at all. Potts said he
knew Morris Meyer and David L. Short,
whose names were signed to the 1900 Rice
will as witnesses, and that Charles F.
Jones, the valet-secretary, was introduced
to him by Patrick in the spring of 1900.
On September 17, 1900, Patrick said: .
"That rich client of mine has made a
will making me a residuary legatee."
On the same day he showed Potts an
assignment of Rice's property, a paper
showing the settlement of the contest of
Mrs. Rice's will, and other papers, among
them several checks in blank signed with
Rice's name and payable to Patrick.
Potts identified - the 1900 will as a paper
Patrick showed him to prove the state
ment that his rich client had made. him
resifluary legatee of all his estate.
"What did you say to Patrick?'.', a
"I said, 'Albert, my boy, you're a lucky
dog,' and I shook hands with him. Then
a thought came to me and- 1 said: 'I don't
think a will like that is good for any
thing. Don't you remember , that , Tilden
will, when the estate was left to. the trus
tees?' He replied: 'That's all right, John.
The estate is practically mine.' " - "

Barney Schrelber felt a trifle - out of
sorts yesterday because his name was
used in connection with that of Danny
Lynch in describing the win of The Oaks
by Muresca, and no doubt not without
some reason. Barney says he started
Satchel and held O'Connor to his en
gagement because he thought the filly
had a chance to get third money, and
never had a thought of depriving W. M."
Rogers of the rider's services. Had the
owner of Colonial Girl stated the facts
to him, the St. Louis penciler stated he
Â¦would very likely have scratched his en
try, which would have permitted O'Con
nor to accept the mount on the Rogers
entry. Barney says his name was once
connected with the energetic Steve
L'Hommedieu and he longs for no more
notoriety in that line.
Following are the entries for this after
noon's events:

Johnny Hoar turned in Educate winner
of the last number, making his second
first for the afternoon. The mare went
to the post second choice to Reina de
Cuba, and led from start to finish. After
once looking like a winner, Alzura lost
the place to Clarando.
All because he was reported to have
outworked Autolight and had been given
his "prep" by Green Morris, which made
it an assured thing that Winnie O'Connor
would ride, Barnato, a rejuvenated crip
ple, was plunged on to win the six-furlong
selling affair. So hot was it and so widely
circulated that the books laid 8 to 5
opening. Later on 3 to 1 could be had.
Despite O'Connor's riding, the good. thing
couldn't raise a gallop, and was eased up
through the stretch. Bullman on Dr.
Boyle jumped away in the lead and was
not caught, downing Bard Burns a couple
of lengths. Tiburon disposed of The
Miller for show honors.
OVER a track that was very muddy
and inclined to be holding, with
here and there a dry patch, 1 it
could not be expected that horses
would % run true ! to form, and a
number of rank outsiders in the betting
annexed purses at Oakland yesterday. In
fact, The Weaver and Dr. Boyle were the
only successful favorites. Any number
of warm tips were floating about, espe
cially one on Barnato, a starter In the
fifth event, all of which served to keep
the attendance up to the average, even
in the face of threatening weather.
"Longshot" Conley landed Loyal S.^a
30 to 1 shot, winner at the wire a length
before the even money favorite, Arlgato,
in the opening mile selling run. At the
start the flrst choice" swerved and was
among the tail-enders around the flrst
turn. Redfern rushed him along down
the back stretch, but could not overhaul
the outsider, which won all the way.
Johnny Humphrey's little gelding, Mar
aschino, always meets one a pound or
two better in the races he starts in.
The Weaver went to the post an . even
money choice for the Futurity course
sprint next to be decided, and beat Mara
schino handily at the wir**, making, the
fourth time the latter has finished sec
ond. Vasallo ran a poor third.
No excuses could be offered for Mar
cato, the even money favorite for the
seven-furlong run. Bullman got the aged
cripple away flying, but could not brush
'off Castake, ridden by little Knapp, and
in a hard drive lost the verdict by a
nose. The winner's odds were played
from 5 down to 7 to 2. Flamero finished
third. â¢ â¢ .
TNever much of *a weight packer, Decoy,
a 6 to 5 favorite for the mile selling run,
ran second to The Gafflr, a 15 to 1 shot,
ably piloted by Johnny Hoar. Burns, who
rode the first choice, was cut off .at the
first turn and compelled to take his'mount
up. For a time Chandoo looked like thi
one to beat, but Hoar made a short cut
into the stretch with The Gafflr and at
the wire won by two open lengths. Es
ternell, away none too well, ran a fair
fourth.

â¢ Mr. S. M. Marshall, bookkeeper of the Atlanta
(Ga.) Gas Light Co., was poisoned with Poison
Oak. He took Sulphur, Arsenic and various
other drugs, and applied externally numerous
lotions and salves with no benefit. At times the
swelling: and inflammation was ao severe be was
almost blind. For eight years the poison would
break out every season. His condition was much
improved after taking one bottle of S. S. S., and
a few bottles cleared his blood of the poison, and
all evidences of the disease disappeared.

Army Surgeon C. S. Se\-erly became so deaf
from catarrh that he was forced to resign his
position and abandon his profession. He says :
â"Of course my inherent professional preju-
dice was hard to overcome, but knowing of
the great benefit you had received, my dear
General, through the use of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets, .1 used them. Â¦ The great and almost
immediate relief I experienced was truly
astonishing. I am now entirely cured an3
have no fear of the I disease returning. I go
back to my old pest next month." i
Mrs. Jane Barlow, the famous modiste, says:
â "I tlraily had to give up personal attention
to my customers, and In consequence many of
them went slsewhere. I was in , despair, for
specialists seemed powerless to help me. Stu-
art's Catarrh Tablets cured me in just a little
while so completely that now I hear as
well as ever."
That Stuart's Catarrh Tablets do effectually
cure catarrh of the eustachian tubes and the
head ncUes and deafness resulting 'therefrom
is attested, by the following:

WASHINGTON, Feb. lO.-Professor
Lewis M. Haupt of the Isthmian Canal
Commission testified before the Senate
Committee on Interoceanic Canals to-day
concerning the engineering features con
nected with the construction of a canal
across the isthmus- of Panama. He said
that while, the proposed Panama canal Is
much shorter than the Nicaragua, the to
tal distance to be covered by vessels in
making the voyage, say from New York
to San Francisco, would be much greater
by the former than by the latter route.
He also said that he apprehended much
difficulty m constructing the big dam at
Bohio, on the Panama line. Another point
made by him as favorable to the Nica
ragua route was that the harbors at the
two ends of that route could be much
more economically maintained than could
those at the ends of the Panama route.
Pensions for Former Confederates.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â A favorable
report to-day was authorized by the Sen
ate Committee on Pensions on the joint
resolution construing the pension 1 law of
1890. The resolution is intended to give a
pensionable status to those who served
in the Confederate army and subsequently
joined the United States and are now de
nied the benefits of the act of ISM on the
ground that they gave aid to the rebel
lion. The committee expresses the opinion
that it was the intention of the framers
of the act of 1890 to include such persons
within its provisions. ,

Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUSA. Feb. 10.â After eighteen years
the murder of Charles Hemstreet, commit*
ted in Princeton, this county, on Septem
ber 5, 1SS4, is to be avenged. James Leon
ard has been captured in Hondo. Tex.,
and has made a full confession. Several
weeks ago Sheriff J. H. Sherer and Dis
trict Attorney I. G. Zumwalt obtained a
clew to the fugitive's whereabouts, and
since then they have kept the wires busy,
with the result that a telegram has been
received from Texas officials- announcing
the capture and confession of Leonard.
Tho necessary requisition papers have
been received from the Governor, and to
day Sheriff Sherer left for Texas to bring
Leonard back for trial.
On the night of the murder Hemstreet
and three other men>.were shaking dice in
a saloon, when two masked men entered
with drawn revolvers and commanded,
"Hands up!" All but Hemstreet compiled.
Hemstreet attempted to draw a revolver
and both robbers fired. He fell dead in
his tracks. â¢ .
The murderers fled to the river, and In
attempting to swim across one of them
wa3 drowned. His body was recovered a
few days afterward. A reward waa of
fered for the capture of the other, but no
trace of him could be found until several
weeks ago. When he was arrested and
confronted with the evidence in the of
ficers' hands he acknowledged hla Identity
and made a full confession, as follows:
My name is James Leanard. I am 60 years
of fige. In 1884 I went to California and went
to the northern part of the State. .Qne after
noon in the forepart of September. I think It
was, I met a young fellow a few miles abova
Princeton. I never learned his name. We had
a couple of bottles of whisky which we drank
quite freely and we became intoxicated. Later
we started for Princeton and when nearly
there my companion proposed to me to hoid
up and rob the saloon. I agreed. We then
went In at the front door and covered the
three or four men who were In there with our
pistols and told them to hold up their hands,
which all did except Hematreet. and as ha
tried to pull his gun we both fired and ha
fell.
When we saw that we had killed him we ran
to the river and Jumped In to swim across.
I reached the other side and made my escape,
but I do not believe my companion did. as I
never saw or heard of him after that. I
learned later that a reward was offered for
me and I left the State and have been on the
dodge ever since. â¢â¢Â» > â¢ , - 1 Â¦. â¢â¢ .
.' Our object was robbery* and neither of us
expected to have to kill any one. I am glad
the chase Is over, and I had rather suffer for
my crime than live over again the past years.
If Sheriff Sherer meets no trouble la
getting his man he should arrive horn*
with him Sunday or Monday. >>.'>
Railroad Must Fay tho Fire Losses.
1 DENVER, Colo., Feb. 10.â Tho Court of
Appeals of Colorado to-day decided that
the "Denver and ; Hio Grande Railway
Company Is responsible for the losses en
tailed by tho fire which burned the old
Antlers Hotel and some other property at
Colorado Springs, October 1, 1898. The
suit against the railway company waa
brought by some of the insurance com
panies which were caught by thÂ© flre. It
was a test case, and is said to - Involve
losses aggregating $400,000. The flre is al
leged to have been caused by sparks from
a locomotive which first set flre to the
Rio Grande depot.
"I know," said Mr. Aguirre, "just "what
can be done with the gallows now In the
prison. I have had several testg, and,
while some fell short of my expectations,
no blunder was ever made. With the elec
tric chair I am not fully cognizant, and,
although there is no doubt that the East
ern chairs are successful. I would not
care to officiate or even be present at
an electrocution 'that might prove a fail
ure. With the gallows now here the worn
is done so quickly that the unfortunate
does not suffer pain. However, if the
Legislature sees fit to make the change
in San Quentin, well and good."
Warden Aguirre of San Quentin said to
day that he preferred the gallows to
electrocution.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 10. â A movement Is
on foot to substitute electrocution for the
gallows in San Quentin prison. The ad
visability of the ' change has been so
earnestly advocated that there is a de
termination to produce certain facts be
fore the next Legislature in the hope that
a bill will be passed making; electrocution
in this State legal. A local electric com
pany, it.is said, offers to supply the cur
rent for the electric chair. ,

In the complaint for divorce Mrs. Her

She says that he struck her on the face
Â¦with his fist and this morning threw
dishes and other articles at her and
drove her from her home. She alleges
that she has been unable to return for
fear of her life. Mrs. Hermelin wants
her husband restrained from threatening
violence and from disposing or seques
trating her property. A permanent
monthly maintenance of $75 is asked for.
French society in this city was set agog
last June by the filing of a $20,000 breach
of promise suit by Mrs. Hector Lagrue
against Julian Hermelin, proprietor of
the Liberty Hotel, at the corner of El
Dorado and San Pedro streets. Mrs. La
grue was the widow of Hector Lagrue, a
well known liquor dealer, who left her a.
fortune of $50,000. Within a year she and
Hermelin had become engaged and had
signed a written agreement to marry. By
the terms of this contract Mrs. Lagrue
was to give Hermelin a portion of her
estate' and in return he "was to give her
an interest in the hotel.
Hermelin later refused to marry her
and she sought reparation in the court.
Before the case came to trial Hermelin
changed his mind and they were wedded.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 10.â After seven
months of wedded life, resulting from the
filing of a $20,000 breach of promise suit,
Mrs. Renee L. Hermelin to-day brought

from Julian Hermelin. Not only this, but
she had her husband arrested for battery
and he has been held for trial "in $500
bonds.

The whole subject matter was then re
ferred to the Judiciary Committee to in
quire' into . the legal phases of the ques
tion, and next Friday afternoon at 2:30
o'clock was set as the time for the in-
QUiry.
D'Ancona presented a substitute reso
lution requesting the City Attorney to
advise as to what officer is empowered in
the case of the removal or resignation of
the clerk of the Justices* Court to fill the
vacancy. Mayor Schmitz said Judge Cook
had decided that the Justices of the Peace
had no right to remove their clerk. D'An
cona objected to taking action on Wynn's
resolution until legal advice had been
taken.
"It should certainly be determined,"
said the Mayor, "whether the charter or
Code of Civil Procedure governs in this
matter. If the code governs, then three
deputies in the Justices' clerk's office
have ben drawing salaries illegally. The
code provides for only two deputies, but
three additional deputies have been ap
pointed' under the charter. Something
must be done to unravel the entangle
ments which two offices of Justices', clerk
are causing."
After the communication had been read
Wynn introduced a resolution approving,
ratifying and confirming the action of
Mayor Schmitz in appointing Powel Fred
rick Justices' clerk to fill the vacancy
caused by the resignation of E. W. Wil
liams and declaring Powel Fredrick ap
pointed as Justices' clerk.
I have taken the liberty respectfully of pre
senting to you these facts and views in the
hope that they may be of some assistance to
your honorable body In arriving at a correct
determination of your duty in the premises.
Wants Mayor's Appointment Eatified
First â Is- the Justices' clerkship an office
created by the charter or by the Code of Cfvil
Procedure?
Secondâ In either event, upon whom falU
the duty of filling the vacancy?
If the office is a charter creation, then there
is no field for doubt. Your honorable body has
no power in the premises. If it is a creation
of the Code of Civil Procedure, it is made a
"municipal affair" by the code, and under
sections 6 and 8 of article XI of the constitu
tion, the- charter . provisions control and va
cancies in this office must be filled by the
Mayor.
Subsequently, conceding the Invalidity ot
their action, but still determined to force liti
gants to do their business with Windrow, the
Justices, as I am informed, addressed to your
honorable body a nomination and recommenda
tion that Mr. Windrow be appointed by you
to fill the vacancy caused' by their unauthorized
"removal" of Williams, in tfie meantime main
taining the pretension of Windrow to legal au
thority. This very action admitted the Impro
priety of the conduct of the Justices of the
Peace, as it is a concession that they had no
power or right to install Mr. Windrow in of
fice. Whether your honorable body has in the
premises power to appoint a successor to Wil
liams depends upon the solution of two ques
tions:"
Concede Action to Be Invalid.
Notwithstanding these considerations the
Justices, without any right or authority, pro
ceeded to install Windrow as clerk, and for
mally ordered all litigants to file their papers
only with Windrow; declaring that they would
not recognize any filing or process Issued by
the rightful clerk, Mr. Fredrick, and to this
date they etate their Intention to stand by
their arbitrary assumption of ; authority, for
under the conditions and circumstances of the
case the appointment of Windrow could not in
any manner be or become a Valid act.
On January 29, 1902, about midnight, the
Justices of the Peace did, at the Hotel Pleas
anton, assume without trial to remove from
office Mr. Williams (who had theretofore al
'ready resigned), on the grounds of malfeasance
and misfeasance in office, and to appoint one
Joseph Windrow in. his stead. No power is
vested in the Justices of the Peace by any law
or charter provision to remove any officer
holding for a fixed term. That power* is vested
solely in the Superior Court, on proper, im
peachment proceedings, and in the Mayor,
under charter provisions, and, as â¢ already
stated, the power of appointment to fill-vacan
cies is also devolved upon the Mayor. Mr.
Windrow has never qualified and Mr. Fredrick
had qualified before Windrow had even ten
dered his informal bond.
Removed Without Trial.
A question has been raised as to whether
the chief clerk of the Justices of the Peace
is, an officer provided by -charter or by the
Code of Civil Procedure. The charter provides
(chapter VII, . article V) that the original ap
pointment of such clerk shall be by the Jus
tices of the Peace, leaving the filling of va
cancies as prescribed by the sections above
referred to. The Code of Civil Procedure (sec
tion 8Â«) provides that the original appointment
of such clerk shall be by .your honorable body
on the recommendation of the Justices, and
designates the clerk a city and county officer.
I am advised that the filling of vacancies In
all city and county offices devolves upon the
Mayor. So that whether the Justices' clerk
ship be an office created by charter or by
statute, the appointment by the Mayor of Mr.
Fredrick to succeed Mr. Williams was proper.
. The Board of Supervisors took a hand
in 'the Justices'- clerk controversy yester
day and delegated the Judiciary Commit
tee to make an investigation for the pur
pose of determining the appointing power
in the matter of filling the vacancy cre
ated by the resignation of E. W. Williams
from the position. The matter came up
after a communication from Mayor
Schmitz had been read exnlaming his po
sition in. his appointment of Powel Fred
rick. After reciting the history of the
case, the Mayor says in his communica
tion: - . :
It was then that Comte moved to striko
out the enacting clause, which was sec
onded by Brandenstein. Comte 'said the
board had a duty to perform by protect
ing .the morality '. of the city. Branden
stein opposed the bill because, he i-saiil

to force It through the board merited its
Frank J. Symmes, president of the
Merchants' Association, said that a poll
of sthe â¢ association had- resulted in 311
members in favor of and 483. against the
ordinance. Symmes said, that the ma
jority Â¦ ruled, and ; the association wished
to go on record against the bill. Rev.
Dr. J. N. Beard and Rev. F. A. Doane
spoke vigorously against the opening of
Ingleside. Protests . against the passage
of the Â¦ bill were then registered by the
Mission evangelical churches and H' G
Matheson. Charles Zinkand Â¦ spoke for
the bill and a petition in favor of it by
400 barbers was ; file*d. . " . -
Many Protests Begistered."
Rev. A. C. Bane held that If gambling
Is morally right it should go on every
day, but if morally wrong we should not
have it for one day. He said the history
of the race track was written' in the
police courts and the Morgue. J. C. Hen
derson, representing the Good Govern
ment Club, . approved the remarks of tho
clergymen that had preceded him, while
Herbert 'Choynski, argued in favor of the
ordinance. ; ' ;
The reopening of Ingleside is not ..for the
welfare of the city. Horse racing is not so
bad but it is conditioned on betting. Now,
betting means gambling, or the selling of pools.
Gambling is robbery, because he who gets his
money in that way gets it. without producing
"it and every principle of financial and political
economy is violated. Some say 'it Is unfair to
take away property. I grant it, but not if the
property is invested in Interests to the detri
ment of tho community. They say you should
allow the privilege - here because . it is per
mitted in San Mateo and Emeryville. That
principle would, hold for burglary if It were
allowed in <regard â¢ to other illegal practice*.
There are' signs over homes reading: "Here
are sons and daughters to be reared; here are
youngr men you are to protect in honesty and
uprightness." Â¦ . Â¦ ' ,
Rev J. S. Thomas requested that the
resolution passed by the Law and Order
League, opposing the passage of the or
dinance, be read, which was done. Dr.
Thomas said:
Clergymen Oppose Ordinance.
P M Clarkson, a property owner in the
vicinity of Ingleside, pleaded for the open
ing of the track, because, he said, condi
tions would be improved thereby. George
Nagle, representing the Knrghts of tne
Royal Arch, composed of wholesale and
retail liquor dealers, argued that . the
opening of the track was a. business
proposition in which . a large number of
men were interested. ,
I Wish to enter my emphatic protest against
the proposed ordinance. It seems to me that
the arguments advanced In favor of the meas
ure proceed from sordid, mercenary and selfish
principles. The only conclusion to be derived
Is that Williams has made a bad investment.
There is a loftier principle involved than mere
commercial spirit. This board has taken a
manly stand in the past, and I beg of it not
to recede therefrom. I- register my protest
against the gambling feature of the proposition
and the blighting influence It exerts. The
Mayor was recently obliged to remove a city
official for attending the races, and a former
City Treasurer is now in San Quentin for the
same reason. I speak for true material pros
perity The money that goes to the racetracks
is taken away from legitimate channels and
Is money that should go into savings banks.
W. R. Pease charged the board with
doing an nijustice to the Ingleside track
owners by taking their property away.
He said that the taxpayers had been In
jured to the extent of millions and men
tioned that the State honors the sport
by helping out the district fairs.
John W. Rodgers, wl}o was the first
speaker In opposition to the bill, said:
The Drivers' Association, composed of gen
tlemen whose respectability d&nnot be im
peached, request me to state that they have
passed a resolution in favor of the Lynch ordi
nance. The question involved is, shall horse
racing be permitted in San Francisco and shall
the business men and tradesmen reap some of
the benefits which It will confer? There are
stablemen and hay men in the association, and
if the ordinance passes business will come to
them. I am not here to make a plea for gam
bling, but for common sense.
Senator E. I. Wolfe made a plea for
the passage of the ordinance on behalf
df the Goldeif Gate Park Drivers' Asso
ciation. He said: i
Pleads for Passage of Ordinance.
Robert Duke appeared on behalf of the
Brewers' Protective Association, and
said that if the ordinance was passed it
would give employment to 1500 men and
bring 1000 blooded horses to this city.
Duke said that the establishing of Ingle
side had caused a village to spring up
in the suburbs. When the track was
closed It threw many men out of employ
ment, causing a loss of many thousands
of dollars." Duke held- that* the race track
had been made the -scapegoat of every
crime, and if the track were reopened the
village would spring up again.
Our enemies have charged that we intended
to have unrestricted racing, and yet we have
announced but 15U days instead. The new club
has increased the value of the purses and rac
ing has in every way benefited tnrough our
efforts. The sum of $dOO,OUO was epent on ln
gleai-le track wnen there was no ordinance
against racing. Max .Popper has stated that
the city should buy the track. We will sell it
to the city, to any corporation, or to Mr. Popper
at cost and agree to give a check of $100,000
to this board to be distributed In charity, la
it right to absolutely confiscate our property?
I appeal to you as business men, is it lair to
tie up $000,000? "We must pay insurance,
taxes and other expenses. We have received
congratulations from ex-Secretary of the Navy
Whitney, August Belmont and James K. Keer.e
for the high and honorable methods with which
we conduct our business. If it, were possible
for this board to pass a law which would for
ever prohibit racing In San Francisco I would
agree to tear down the Ingleside buildings and
turn the place Into a cow pasture.
Thomas H. Williams, president of the
New California Jockey club, was the
nrst to be heard in support of the ordi
nance. Williams told or the efforts of his
organization to put racing on an honest
basis, and referred to the fact that the
sport was encouraged by the titled heads
oi" all Europe. lie continued:
The first compromise of the race track
promoters was demonstrated when Su
pervisor Braunhart moved to strike out
"sixty days " and insert in lieu tnereof
"thirty-six days' as the period during
which pool selling would be allowed. Su
pervisor iiggers seconded the motion, and
ijynch, the author of the bill, accepted
the amendment. Jiggers moved that the
people interested De given an opportun
ity to be heard, and Brandensteins mo
tion that five minutes be the limit for
each speaker was carried.
Makes Plea "for tne Sport.
That extraordinary interest was taken
in the ordinance was evident from, the
unusually large crowd present -in the
Supervisors' chambers. A number of
clergymen of several denominations
were present to voice vigorous objections
to the proposed, bill. Professional men
and business men we're on hand, some to
urge the passage of the measure, Â»while
others joined tne clergymen in their op
position.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday re
fused to pass to print the proposed or
dinance legalizing the selling of pools on
horse races within the track inclosure
for a 'period of sixty days in any calen
dar year. The measure was killed | on
Comte's motion, to strike out the enact
ing clause, .which renders it nugatory
and of no effect. Comte's motion-pre
vailed by a vote of 12 in favor .to C
against, and; the reopening of. Ingleside,
which would have followed the passage
of the : bill, was made impossible. Not
only was the measure defeated by the
decisive vote noted, but a motion to re
consider at next Monday's meeting was
lost by the same vote that killed the
enacting clause, and still another motion
to reconsider at once was defeated like
wise.
Brandenstein explained that after due
Investigation by the Finance Committee
the record showed that the firm had over
charged the city for printing transcripts
on appeal in criminal cases. He also filed
a minority report as a member of the
Finance Committee recommending the
passage of the resolution. The majority
report of the committee recommended
that the City Attorney advise if any re
course could be had against the firm or
the former County Clerk, Treasurer and
Auditor for the excessive charges. Wynn's
motion that the resolution be considered
at the next meeting was adopted. i

The crowning, shame of the institution nick
named by the public "hospital" is the placing
of coiiMiinptive patients in the same room with
other patients. We most earnestly recommend
and btg you to at once provide separate quar
ters for these unfortunates, the expense to be
taken trom the emergency fund. We do not
think sufficient provision is made for the hos
pital as sickness increases with the growth
of the city.
We picture with horror the terrible effects of
a oonlif.sratiou in the hospital, there being but
one small exit In the rear of the building.
The number of patients in the hospital is
420. There are 42 muses and at Jio time are

of ihs lavatories make them unrtt l'or use by

" Dear Mrs. Pinkham : â Being a mother of five children I
have had experience with the general troubles of my sex. I was
lacerated when one of my children was born and from that hour I
date all my afflictions. I found that within a few months my health
was impaired, I had female weakness and serious inflammation and
frequent flooding. I became weak and <Hzzy but kept on my feet,
dragging through my work without life or pleasure. A neighbor
who had been helped by taking Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound insisted that I take at least one bottle. I did so and
felt so much better that I kept on the treatment. For seven months
I used the Compound faithfully and gladly do I say it, health and
strength are mine once more. I know how to value it now when it
was so nearly lost, and I appreciate how, great a debt I owe you.
The few dollars I spent for the medicine cannot begin to pay what it
was worth to me. Yours very truly, Mrs. Anna McKay, Chaplain
Mrs. Annie McKay, Chaplain Sons of
Temperance, 326 Spadina Ave., Toronto,
Cured of Severe Female Troubles by Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.

Provisions.
CHICAGO, Feb. 1J.â -Ordinary Influences ap
peared to have little effect on. wheat. Up to
midday the range was over only %c and the
whole session showed only a shade more. The
slightly bullish feeling with -which the market
closed Saturday was lost at the outset to-day
on minor bits of bearish news. The cables did
not reflect any of our strength, the amount on
passage had increased 1,824,000 bushels and
world's shipments were liberal. The mild
weather, with additional snows over the West,
was favorable for the growing crop. All told,
the market was dull and largely a scalping,
affair, traders selling on all the bulges and buy-
Ing on the dips. The most Important Item of
news of the day was the decrease of 1,363,000
bushels, almost double the decrease expected,
yet there was no effect on the pit. May opened
Vt@%o to a shade lower at 77%@77%c, and on
early corn strength sold to 78c. Commission
houses later turned sellers, the. oats break had
a depressing effect, and May reacted to 77%@
77%c. The close was easy, May %c down, at
77%@77%c. .
Corn at times had fair support and some act
ivity, but In the long run the bearish tendency
Â¦won Â»out. Commission house selling and the
oats depression brought a sag and In the ab
sence of buying orders the gain was lost. May
closed easy, %@%c lower, at 61%@61%c.
Oats had a bad time from the opening. The
start was fairly steady with corn and soon
after the opening May options were selling at
43%c, Saturday's closing figure. Then there
set in a deliberate raid, such as was witnessed
two weeks ago, and May was pressed down
quickly to 42c. There was a poor demand and
there was almost no early support. Toward
the close commission houses helped toward re
gaining a fraction of the loss. May closed
weak, %@%c lower, at 42%@42%c. .
The strength In provisions was something of
a surprise, considering the large receipts of
Â«Â«^S G><^Â° head at Â£ polnts ' compared to
66.000 head yast year. Offerings were light ex
cept when prices were at their highest" May

Butter and Eggs opened the week firm and
well cleaned up. Some dealers' floors were al
most bare of both descriptions. The reduction
In stocks Is said to be due to moderate re
ceipts and a good local demand, as there is not
much shipping demand for Eggs and prac
tically none for Butter. The exhaustion ot
packed Butter in its various forma Is also help
ing the Butter market by causing a good in
quiry for the cheaper grades'. There is no
change in prices, however. Cheese remains ai

vertiser's London financial cablegram says: .
Good news' regarding the Boer war strength
ened the stock market to-day. Kaffirs were
very active, but were disturbed by large reali
zation, due to the difficulty of carrying over
weak bulls who were shaken out. American
stocks Were livelier. The professional contin
gent is waking up. Apparently, however, it Is
all New York buying-. Prices opened around
parity. At first the Reading Issues were bid
up on New York account. Later the same
sources caused a \ renewed demand for Erie,
Reading and Southern Railway. The close was
strong. United States Steel was In demand in
the street. Rio Tintos sold at 45%. Copper
opened %d down, but recovered to Â£54 %s the
ton.
The market was a heavy borrower of funds.
Silver was weak on free American sales.

There Is an easier feeling in Onions . and
Oregons are quoted lower. , Los Angeles Peas
were much weaker under heavier receipts and
some . overheated stock sold below the quota
tions. Other vegetables from Los Angeles
were scarce ' and continued to bring high
prices. Mushrooms were plentiful and sold
readily at good prices. . ' ,'
'Receipts of Potatoes were f 7081 sacks, of
which 4481 were from Oregon. The receipts
of Onions were liberal, being 1202 sacks. In
cluding 187 from Oregon by steamer. Bur
banks from Salinas Valley - continue firm un
der a steady inquiry and scarcity of fancy
stock. '. The demand ' for Seed .Potatoes is
strong and Early . Rose are scarce and higher.
The bulk of the receipts from Oregon, per
steamer, show effects of the frost in that
State, and no sales have been reported as
yet. Â¦Â¦-. - â¢ ...

LOCAL MARKETS.
XEW YORK. Feb. 10. â There waÂ» some ap
prehension In speculative circles that the sup
port accorded the market on Saturday after
the appearance of the- bank statement would
prove but temporary and that a setback was
Imminent in the prices of stocks. The heavy
fire losses reported "over Sunday, especially
that at Paterson, caused additional apprehen
sion before the opening-. The uneasiness how.
ever, proved to be unfounded. There was
abundant buying of stocks from the opening
and but little liquidation was encountered.
There was, indeed, profit-taking In many of
the stocks which have had striking advances
recently, but the strength was diverted to new
points. To-day 1 s market, although disclosing
some striking features of strength, by no means
took on the full proportions of a bull market
in either the volume of dealings, the extent of
the advances or the breadth of the distribution.
The bulk of the business was still congested
in comparatively few stocks, notably Southern
Pacific and the Readings and stocks most
nearly allied to them. There were some in
dications of a common origin for the active
dealings In both these leaders. The buying
of Southern Pacific is avowedly based on the
rate of earnings reported for the company and
the possibilities of reduced operating expenses
and refunding of high Interest mortgages. The
gain In the price of the stock extended to 2%.
Tne-Btrenjrth of the 'coalers was due to the
belief that an adjustment of labor disputes
was assured. The soft-coal carriers shared in
the movement. Many of the less prominent
stocks were features of the trading. Some of
this class of stocks which rose last week suf
fered eharp reactions. American Express ros*

An adjournment until . to-morrow was
taken, but it is feared Judge Harring

sume his place upon the ; bench. Mean
while the expense of maintaining- a horde

payers. Â¦
AL.TURAS, Feb. 10.â There was no ses
sion of court to-day In the Lookout lynch
ing case, Judge Harrington being confined
to his bed. He was too ill to appear in
court. The trial has been a severe strain
oh the nerves of -both counsel and court,
and Judge Harrington's system was first
to .succumb to the nerve-racking 1 ordeal
to which it has been subjected during the
twelve weeks the trial has been in pro
gress. . â¢ ,
HOw serious the illness- of Judge Har
rington is cannot be .said at this time.
An ulcerated tooth has added to : the
troubles of the ; Judge. Last night the

a highly nervous condition that it was im
possible for him to take his accustomed
seat on the bench to-day.

Â¦ f*Tr-3 HE British ship Mylomene, which
II arived here yesterday morning
|| from Caleta Buena, came within j
; lL an ace of shipwreck at the very
i end of her voyage. But for a
! timely i>uff of wind and Pilot Newt. Jor-
I dan's ability to take advantage of it, the
! vessel would have ended her voyage and
\ in all probability her career on the rocks
i of Point Diablo. Jordan boarded the
! ship during the night. Wind and weather
j being favorable, he decided to sail his
I charge into the harbor. All went well
j until the ship was almost inside . the
i heads. The wind dropped suddenly and
| the favoring breeze was succeeded by a
! dead calm. The currents took charge of
! the vessel and whirled her around and
Â¦ around. She was absolutely at their
Â¦ mercy, and for awhile all the pilot's skill
! availed nothing:. The ship was almost
Â¦ on â¢ Point Diablo when, puff! came a
breeze. She steadied herself, and as the
breeze freshened shook off the prip of the
currents and obeyed the will of the
wheelsman. .Pilot Jordan soon had her
-on her course again and sailed her safely
to her anchorage. Her time from Caleta
Buena was sixty-one days. She brought
21,844 basrs of niter.

Past-Sinking San Francisco
SEATTLE, Feb. 10.â The steamship
Nome , City, ".-; Captain Daniels, Â¦. which
reached port this .-. morning from San
Francisco, had as passengers Captain L.
Johnson and five members, of .the crew
of j the schooner Laura Pike, who were
picked up at sea in a small boat thirty
miles off Trinidad on Thursday morning.
.When ." they left the schooner she was
wallowing In the 'seas and fast sinking
from leaks caused by rough weather.. ;
The "Laura Pike left San: Francisco on
January 26, en route. to. Eureka for a car
go of lumber. Captain Johnson tried to
cross Humboldt bar, but" adverse : winds
drove the schooner, back into the ocean
and for ; several days â¢ the Pike, was buf-^
feted about. : Eariy on Thursday morning
it was discovered that the schooner Â¦ was
leaking.- The crew mafte futile attempts
to stop the inpouring water. Thirty-six
hours laterâ on Friday afternoon, - at 4
o'clockâ they took to the small boats and
reached the Nome City, which had been
attracted by the signals of distress flying
from the sinking vessel. .
One peculiar coincidence about the res
cue of the Pike's crew is "the fact that
they were picked up, in almost the same
spot where the Nome City found the six
members of the. ill-fated Walla Walla's
crew about a month ago, thirty mil ea off
Trinidad.

Immediate Relief from the Use of
Paine $ Celery Compound.
ly " BOSTON, Jan. 13, 1902.
"TO THE STOTEBIffG PUBLIO: It is with a feeling of extrema grati-
tude and thankfulness and a' humane desire to benefit others that I write out
i my own experience in the 113a of Prof. Edward E. Phelps' wonderful prepara-
tion, called "Pains's Celery Compound." Owing to a fall from a horse several
years ago, I became a nervous invalid, and last year I entered a hospital as
a" patient, where I was operated on by a famous Hew York surgeon.
The surgical operation ,was successful, but nervous prostration followed.
A summer in Newport, with the best medical attendance, failed to restore my
nerves to their normal condition. I was absolutely unable to digest any solid
food, and this weak condition of my digestive organs, combined with insomniai
caused the deepest depression. A constant tenderness and soreness in tho
region of my stomaoh, with a dull headache and extreme weakness, created a
feeling of hopelessness, from which I was unable to rise.
It was in this melancholy frama of mind that I "chanced to meet a Boston.
t lawyer, who said to me, "I was in almost tho condition that yon are now in, and
after spending hundreds of dollars without receiving any benefit I was induced
by a friend to give Paine's Celery Compound a trial, which I did, and it cured
me completely when everything else had failed."
I was rather skeptical about trying a prepared medicine, but I ordered a
â¢ bottle from my druggist and began to take it according to directions. Much to
my surprise I slept soundly at night and did not wake in the morning with the
usual dull headache. Then, too, I developed an appetite for solid food and soon
I was able to digest a course dinner without any unpleasant sensations. I am
now completely restored to health after about two months' use of the Compound.
Sympathizing deeply with all who may be suffering as I did, I take this method
of reaching strangers, after writing personal letters to my particular friends.
With the sincere hope. that others may be benefited as I have been by the
use of Paine's Celery Compound, I am

j,SAN JOSE, Feb. 10.â The proposition to
construct a scenic railway In the foot
hills between Los Gatos and Saratoga
will be considered by the Santa Clara
County Improvement Club. The proposed
road would be 700 feet above the valley
and give an unobstructed view of the
orchards. . From it all the towns of the
valley could be seen and the broad ex
panse of orchards would give the tourist
some idea of Santa Clara Valley's re
sources.
Scenic Road May Be Built.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 10.â Milk Inspector
Harry Conner was the victim of two high
waymen on the Alameda, near Sunol
street, early this morning. Conner was
looking for milkmen and sampling their
cans to see if the contents contained the
required percentage of butter fat. He
was walking in the center of the street.
As he passed two men one. wheeled about
and covered him with a revolver. Con
ner's hands shot skyward at the com
mand "Hands up," and the other footpad
then searched his pockets. The robbers
took a gold watch and chain and $1 50.
Conner was then ordered to move on.

.Matthews explained that his discharge
papers were i destroyed in a fire In Los
Angeles. He showed a surprising famil
iarity with events of the war and with
the movements of the regiment to. Â¦which
he claimed to belong, entering Into mln
utc details and. giving dates correctly, but
he had the names of the officers wrong.
The Government officials believe that he
was a camp follower oj a servant. Mat
thews was Indicted jointly with Lorenzo
D.' Wilgus, a lawyer residing in Sacra
mento. The jury was. out only an hour
and gave the aged darky the benefit of
the doubt.. .
William Matthews, alias James Brown,
a colored man, was acquitted by a jury
yesterday in the United States District
Court of the charge of swearing to a
false claim for a pension. Matthews rep
resented.that he was a private of Com
pany B, First Regiment of Volunteers,
during the Civil War. The principal wit
nesses against him were W. N. Cobb, : in
spector in the Pension Bureau at Wash
ington, and John 'G. Hesse, clerk in the
War Department In -Washington, D. C
These officials were sent to this city spe
cially for the purpose of testifying
against the defendant. They showed that
there was no record of Matthews' enlist
ment under his true name or his alias.

SALT LAKE RAILROAD'S
OFFICERS HE-ELECTED
President Roosevelt' does not propose to
rob Cuba of any territory, and he will
probably decide that the small Islands,
with the exception of the Isle of- Pines,
which He within the marine league limit
shall remain Cuban soil.
Under article two- Spain cedes to the
United States the "Island of Porto Rico
and other islands now under Spanish sov
ereignty in the West IndUs."
Officials of the War and Navy Depart
ments say the United States by the ex
press provisions of the treaty acquired
American sovereignty over all the islands
fringing the Cuban coast. There are many
of r these, some on the ndrth coast being
strategically valuable.
. The War Department has received three
petitions from residents of the Isle of
Pines applying for annexation to- the
United States. Cubans who assert the
ownership of several small islands have
offered "to sell them to this Government,
and one man threatened that in case the
United States refused to accept his propo
sition he would offer his land to a for
eign power. ' 'Â¦ ,
After the inauguration of Senor Palma
as President the withdrawal of the Amer
ican troops will commence. Detachments
will be retained, however, at Havana,
CienfUegos, Nipe and Guantanamo, where
it is proposed to- establish naval reserva
tions. These reservations will be imme
diately sold or leased by the Cuban Gov
ernment in accordance with this provi
sion of the Cuban constitution:
"To enable the United States to maintain
the independence of Cuba and to protect
the people thereof, as well as for its owa
defense, the Government of Cuba will sell
or lease to the United States lands neces
sary for coaling or naval stations at cer
tain specified points to be agreed upon
with the President of the .United States."
The troops-retained in Cuba will ulti
mately be superseded by marines, but it
is believed it will be a part of wisdom to
maintain a force in the island during the
formative stage of the new government. â¢
Havana has been selected as a site for
a naval station because of its strategic
position. Naval ships made an exhaustive
survey of the northwestern coast of Cuba
in the hope- of finding a harbor which
could be occupied in place of Havana. No
well sheltered port was found.. The
Cubans will probably object to the pres
ence of a United State3 coaling station
within the boundaries of their capital, but
the reservation will be on the eastern
shore of the bay and will be away from
the city proper.
In addition to establishing naval sta
tions in Cuba the question of ownership
of- the Isle of Pine*** and of other islands
situated in Cuban waters must be prompt
ly decided: Under article one of the
treaty of Paris, Spain relinquished "all
claim of sovereignty over and title to
Cuba." . . . ' â¢
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.Â» WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â Serious
consideration has been given by the Presi
dent and Secretary Root to the method of
procedure to be followed in the acquisition
of sites for naval stations in Cuba. The
plan which will probably be followed is
this:
Special DlÂ«oatch to The Call.
Withdrawal of American
Troops After . Palma
Is President. .
SELECTING NAVAL
STATIONS IN CUBA
Occupied as Great Britain Is In South
Africa, she is naturally deeply gratified
by the action of this Government. Japan
is also pleased, as without American in
tervention she could not hope to prevent
the conclusion of the arrangement which
she considers so objectionable.
The United States has been advised,
however, that the Russo-Chinese Bank,
which is a Russian institution, has nego
tiated an arrangement with China under
which it has obtained exclusive mining
and industrial concessions in Manchuria.
American trade in Northern China is ex
tensive, and the administration fears that
it will be seriously injured if the arrange
ment with the Russo-Chinese Bank is
signed.
The arrangement to which the United
States has objected Is not the treaty for
the evacuation of Manchuria. This treaty
has been robbed of the features whose
operation, in the opinion of this Govern
ment, would injuriously affect American
Interests. Its terms are considered some
what harsh, but, as an administration
official remarked, the Chinese must ex
pect to make concessions to Russia, and
the world at large must appreciate that
Russia has a preferential position in
Manchuria and has extensive railroad in
terests in that province to guard. No
protest . will be made against the signa
ture of this treaty.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W:, WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â In protqst
ing against the conclusion of secret ar
rangements between the Russo-Chlnese
Bank and China" Secretary Hay has given
fresh proof of the intention of the United
States to lead in the world's affairs. It
developed to-day that Instead of. follow
ing the lead of Great Britain and Japan
in this matter the Secretary took action
in advance of either of these powers. It
was only after they had learned of the
character of the 'instructions sent to Em
bassador Tower at St. Petersburg and
Minister Conger at Peking that the To
kio and London governments acted. .

The club resolved to send a full delega
tion to the biennial convention of the
State League of Republican Clubs. at San
Jose. . . . -. - - . .
At this point' there was a slight digres
sion' from the ; purchase of the. n*P er into
the field of politics. Mr. "Ach wEnted to
know < if .' Mr.',. Daniels | had, t at J that - time, 1
ever taken ; any, active part in politics in
Alameda County, to. which he replied that
he .ImloV though,; he had ".never held any
official position . except that of . trustee of
Piedmont School ; district. He said 'that
Revert to Politics.
*Q. â What report did he make to you? A.â
That Mr. Leach would like to sell his stock.
My recollection is as far as hewas able to
report at that time. .
Q.â Did you ever speak to anybody else about
it before you spoke to Pardee or Dalton? A
Not that I recollect. : .
Q. â Did - you receive any report " from . Mr.
Williams?- A. â Yes.
| Q. â How Â¦ long after your . conversation with
him?' A. â Oh. I don't know. .
Q.â Approximately? A.-rOh, possibly a.
week. Â¦ -. . ' .:.... . ...
Q.â Did he report to you? A. â He did.
Q. â Before you spoke to Dr. Pardee or Mr.
Dalton? A. â I don't know .whether he did or
not. ; :". ..... Â»Â« i â¢'. - ...
Q. â What was it that you wanted him to do?
A.â I asked him to find out from Mr. Leach
whether he did want to sell his Interest and
what It was. '
Q. â And if Â¦ I understood you correctly you
wanted Mr. Williams to investigate the affairs
of the'Oakland Enquirer Publishing Company?
A. â That was not what I testified. "'- Â¦
After the conversation with Mr. Collins
the next step in the negotiations was the
tslk with Mr. Williams, in which Mr
Daniels said that he told Mr. Williams
that he had an idea that Mr. Leach would
like to sell his interest In the Enquirer
and that he would like to have Mr. Wil
liams find out i the extent of that interest
and for what it could be purchased.
This particular part of the deal which
resulted in his purchase of- the paper -was
described - as Â¦ follows :
Q.â Well, who was it sent you to John Wil
liams? A. âI went myself.
Talks to Williams.
Mr. Ach wanted to know where he heard
the remark made and Mr. Daniels replied
that S. T. Gage had dropped the observa
tion in a casual conversation. Subsequent
to that Mr. Daniels said that he conceived
the idea of securing the control of the
Enquirer, but he had no , more conversa
tions* with Mr. Collins about the matter.
Later he talked with John Williams, an
expert accountant, who was a â¢ friend of
his, and then with Dr. Pardee and Henry
P. Dalton. .'
Q.â Ever consulted a physician about lapses
?., " lemol% y or anything of that k4nd in you*
Hie? A. â No. fir. -->â¢.. ...-â¢'
., Q- â Have you ever contemplated such a
thing owing to the fact that your memory
would at times exhibit that it was not aa
strong as it had been? A. â No, sir. . . .
.. Q -rr Had yÂ° u ever, noticed that it was failing?
A.â No, sir. . . . .
'â¢Mr. Ach then went into the details of
the negotiation that culminated in the
purchase of 'the paper by Mr. Daniels.
Mr. Daniels stated that the first one
with whom he had talked about the pos
sibility of the paper passing from the
controlof Frank A. Leach was D. Edward
.Collins, the plaintiff in. this suit. Mr.
Daniels said that one day, shortly after
Mr. Leach- had' ben appointed Superin
tendent of the Mint in San Francisco, he
had heard that Mr. Leach would probably
have a hard . time running- a newspaper
and a Federal office and that he might
like to dispose of his stock. Upon hear
ing that Mr. Daniels said that he had
gone to Mr. Collins in his bank and had
remarked, "I have heard it said that Mr.
Leach would have a difficult time running
a newspaper and a Federal office," to
which Mr. Collins replied, "Yes, Mr.
Leach would like to sell and I. would like
to have him." Â¦ ,

A. â No, sir.

Q.â Have you been ill, Mr.- Daniels? A.â
No. sir.
Q.â Have you ever had any brain disease?
A. â No, sir.
Q-â You ever received any injury upon the
head, in any way? A. â Not serious.
From Mr. -Daniels' f private banking af
fairs Mr. Ach." skipped to the ; borrowing
of : the j money ,with â¢ which the purchase
of the- Enquirer, was made. '. He tried- to

OAKLAND, Feb. 10.â There were
threats of contempt proceedings,
lots of refusals to answer, not a
few very interesting answers and
| a general lively time during the
taking of the deposition of G. B. Daniels,
the president and general manager of the
Oakland Enquirer Publishing Company,
which was continued before Court Com
missioner Babcock this morning. Henry
j Ach, attorney' for D. Edward Collins, the
plaintiff in the action, spent the morning
trying to fasten the purchase of the stock
I of the Enquirer upon Henry P. Dalton
and Dr. George C. Pardee, but .the near
est he could get to that was an admission
by Mr. Daniels that he had talked with
Dr. Pardee and Mr. Dalton about the pur
chase of the stock before the purchase
was made, but Mr. Daniels would , not
admit that they had the slightest connec
tion with his deal. AVhen the questions
came too hot and heavy Mr. Ach was met
with a decided refusal to make any an
swer. When It came to a question. as to
whether Mr. Daniels had any verbal con
tract or private agreement with Dr. Par
dee and Mr. Dalton about the stock of the
paper Mr. Daniels positively refused, to
answer. â¢ â¢ ' .
Then Attorney Ach wanted' to know
about the printing combination between
the Enquirer and the Tribune over the
city printing, and asked Mr. Daniels to
state how much had been paid out of- the
money collected by the Enquirer from the
city of Oakland to the Tribune. This Mr.
Daniels said he could not answer, though
he would if he could. Then Mr. Ach want
ed the books of the Enquirer in order that
this phase of the case might be investi
gated, but Mr." Daniels refused to produce
the books, and Mr. Ach threatened con
tempt proceedings. An adjournment was
then taken, so that the record might be
written up.

After Mr. Daniels secured his reports
from Mr. .Williams he said that he had
consulted with both Dr. Pardee and

Mr. Dalton's office and in his own store.
Then Mr. Ach fired a series of questions
that developed the fact that the ones

A long series of questions resulted In
the. information that Mr. Williams had
been requested by Mr. Daniels to con
tinue his . researches into the condition
of the Enquirer, and that Mr." "Williams
had finally brought him some of the
books and statements of the paper, which
lie had examined in his own store. These
were then shown to Dr. Pardee and
Henry P. Dalton. Questions and an

EEVOLUTION" AGAINST
CASTRO IS GAINING
The Golden Gate Republican Club met
last evening at the Columbian building,
with President D. W. McNeill in the
chair. After the enrollment of thlrty
tnree new members the election of offi-
Golden Gate Republican Club.
It was stated inaccurately in The Call
a few days ago that 22.000 Republican
voters failed to support the Republican
nominee for Mayor at-the municipal elec
tion last November. WVlls received
1T.TIS votes. The Republican vote cast at
the general election of 1900 was 32,300.
The falling oft therefore amounted to
17.2S2 votes. When a rough and ready
Jsxty machine forces a nomination,
yrlthout giving delegates to a convention
the opportunity of discussing the charac
ter and fitness of candidates, the inde
pendent. anii-boF? Republican voters
generally give at the ballot-box an ob
ject lesson in machine smashing.
The region of country known as North
ern Caliiornia did not fare very well at
the hands of the Republican State Con
vention of 188S. The favored sons of the
north were turned down In monotonous
succession, but they stood manfully by
the ticket in the general election. The
news may cause a flutter of surprise In
Yuba and Sutter that Colonel E. A.
Forbes was tendered the appointment of
adjutant general to succeed the Jate Gen
erai W. H. Seamans. When the fact of the
tender was made known Senator W. M.
Cutter, secretary of the Republican State
Central Committee. advised General
Forbes against acceptance. The rumor
comes that the Senator is on the war
path. He wants no olive branches from
Governor Gage. His terse and vigorous
Ftyle of proclaiming his sentiments in
fluenced Colonel Forbes to decline the
honors of chief of staff. It is common
political gossip that Senator Cutter Is
himself an aspirant for. gubernatorial
honors. He ranks as one of the clever
est politicians in the State. He has dem
onstrated his skill as a leader in the
Assembly and Senate, and in many a
State convention has displayed the quali
ties of a successful tactician. Senator
Cutter may be able to win the support
of many delegcies to the convention from
the counties of Yuba, Sutter, Glenn, Co
lusa. Butte and Teharaa.
Did Kot Fare Well.
In the readjustment of Congressional
district lines ihe Legislature placed Sa:i
Jcaquin County, winch was formerly In
the Second District, into the Sixth. It is
well understood, however, that S. D.
Woods of San Joaquin, now in Congress
representing the fceeona District, will not
contend for nomination in the Sixth
against Mr. Needham. It is gossip in iÂ»o
luical circles that Mr. Woods may be
placed on the State ticket for Lieutenant
Governor. It is only a step from San
Joaquin to the mountains, wnere the Ke
pubiscans are prone to go in quest of
good material for the second place on the
ticket. J. B. Reddick of Caiaveras was
put on the ticket for Lieutenant dovernor
by the convention which nominated H. H.
Markham for Governor, and Jacob H.
Neft gave strength to the ticket In 1S9S. If
the Republicans of the south redeem the
promise made at Sacramento in 1S9S to
nominate for Governor in 1902 a man from
Northern or Central California the Lieu
tenant Governorship will no doubt be
given to Southern California. Perhaps
Judge McKinley, the Los Angeles BbUi
who is a clever hand at the typewriting
machine, may be selected to go on Lhe
ticket with Preston. Flint, Cutter, Pardee
or Edson.
Transfers San Joaquin.
The Democrats arc preparing for a vig
orous light to break the solid Re
publican Congressional delegation of this
Slate* In the Sixth District there Is
talk in Democratic circles of nominating
Judge William Cor'.oy of Madera to run
Ejrainst Representative J. C Needham.
Mr. Conley is known as a vote-getter. In
i*T<S he was nominated by the Democrats
and Populists for Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court- He went down to defeat,
but the counties now comprising the Con
gressional district in which he resides
pave him in the aggregate a majority of
6000. When it comes to a turn at vote
geUrne Mr. Needham can hold his own
with the best man that the Democrats can
put in the field. His successful battles m
the old Seventh District in the campaigns
of 1S9S and 1?>J enlisted the admiration of
the Republican State Central Committet.-
As a debater on the platform and as an
all-around hustler for votes Needham is
fir&t-class. Under the new apportionment
which went into effect on the lirst day ot
this year the Sixth Congressional Distilc;
is composed of the counties of Sanui

Mr. Daniels declared that there were no
contracts or agreements between himself
and Dr. Pardee. H. P. Dalton or his father
and the. hearing went over until to-mor

- I had no great amount of means
at that time, and I went to my
friends, Pardee and Dalton, and
talked the matter over with them,
showed them the result of the fig

hooks, and the information -which
Mr. Leach had clvm Mr. Williams,
and asked them if I could make the
purchase nnd put up the stock n*
security. If they would indorse tny
nnper: and they said they would.
That was the result of Â«ome con
siderable conversation. Then, later
on. Mr. Leach, I believe, told 31 r.
Williams that they three. Mr. Leaeh.
Mr. >ye and Mr. Collins, had an
agreement that no one of them
shonld sell their stock without the

WHATCOM, Wash.. Feb. 10.-When
about half-way through Deception Pas*
the steamer Dode, Captain Wiman, lost
her rudder at 2:30 o'clock this morning.
She was close to the rocky north side at
the time. Captain Wlman signaled "full
steam ahead" and was enabled to hold the
steamer's nose in such a position against
the rocks that she was kept from drifting
across the pass to possible destruction.
For two hours the steamer kept this
position. Then the tide changed and she
was enabled to drift to a place of anchor
age, where her passengers were taken off
by a passing steamer.

sengers expressing their admiration for
the. captain in rescuing them from what
they termed "a most perilous situation."

A piano is a companion of a lifetime, and pianos, like husbands,
can be good, bad or indifferent j
We can sell you a piano for $25, if you want one, and for $40, or $60,
or a thousand dollars.
We can sell you a better piano for $25 than you get elsewhere for $25,
and we can sell you a better piano for $500 than you can get elsewhere
for a like amount.
But we cannot do impossibilities â every piano we sellis backed by
our guarantee, and that guarantee means every word it. says.
Be careful in your choosing â go to a firm you know to be respon-
sible, see what they have. This costs you nothing but time and may
save you years of regret.

fifty years. We have the agency for the best pianos produced in the
world and guarantee every instrument we sell. ' , ,

blue, brown and black grounds with harmonizing stripes;
the ljose sell regularly at 2 pair for 25c and 3 pair for 50c;
