IP developed yesterday that Eleanor Fuller was strangled to death by a man with whom she had been acquainted before she answered the advertisement which he had placed in the morning papers simply to meet the girl
under its protection and thi\s allay the suspicions of Mrs. Fuller, so he could successfully carry out his hellish -plot ;- r Â¦ -
The police are now concentrating their efforts toward discovering the identity^^ of John Bennett, the man who' lured Eleanor Fuller away from home. In his elaborate plans to avoid detection the murderer made
several blunders and left clews by which Captain Seymour hopes to eventually track him down. * ,
The police are convinced that John Bennett is the man who rented the Sutter street flat under the. name of C. B. ; Hawkins and. later, under the name of Scott, bought the bed on which the girl was murdered.

about prying into the Identity of the mur- .

are picking up the trail from the Popular
restaurant, where it is known absolutely
that Eleanor . Fuller met the man. The

' M. A. Serebrenek, a representative of a
prominent tea firm In Shanghai, was an
acquaintance of the murdered girl and her
mother, and brother. He came here dur
ing the month of December from the
Orient,- carrying ' letters of introduction
from the Fuller girl's uncle.' Mrs. Fuller
and her daughter visited Serebrenek at
his apartments at the Palace Hotel sev
eral times. In a little leather, pocketbook
found among, the murdered girl's : effects
was a card j bearing the- name of the firm
which \ Serebrenek represented. For a

girl, would not wllllnglv remain away
from home, even, if tempted with the
most glittering prospects.- The theory is
that her murderer: was a wily-tongued
degenerate, who promised to pay her a
flattering sum to take care of the house
hold he probably told her he would es
tablish, and in this. way he - influenced
the innocent girl, to' ".withhold her ' ac
quaintance with him from Mrs. Fuller
until he had Inserted the advertisement
in the paper and' met her under the cloak
of protection it afforded. After meeting
Bennett the day she left home the mur
derer..in all probability ordered her' to
telephone to her home and say that she
had been employed and that her duties
would commence at once. As the un
fortunate girl was telephoning Bennett In
all â¢ probability stood â¢ close by to
prompt her, answers, fearing, perhaps,
that the slightest mishap would - thwart
his heinous .ntentions. This theory ac
counts for the. fact' that the murdered
girl told her brother, who answered the
telephone, that, she was . at 1500 Geary
street, . and that her newly-found - em
ployer wanted her to remain there, all
night.
As this was' two days before Eleanor
Fuller disappeared, her murderer had
probably visited the house to await .< the
coming of the bed>upon which he mur
dered his girlish -victim. 1 Next ; the mur

Young Gillen was ordered to take tho

door of the premises 1 , by a man who an
swers the description of . Bennett and
Hawkins, who told him to leave the stuff

tery.- Bertrand states' that the bed upon
which the bedy of the, murdered girl'lay
was not in the back room -on '.the upper
floor, nor in any other room in tho house,

Against this statement is the gtory of

J. W. Clift, a gripman on the Sutter

the tangled skein surrounding the. case
that deepens the mystery. Last Tuesday
or Wednesday an old woman, carrying a

old .'woman turned and started up the
steps of the house where the nude- body
of Eleanor Fuller, lay dead. That was
the last CUft saw of the woman. Why
she went 'to the vacant dwelling or who

'Captain Seymour is convinced that

theory that^the dead girl was poisoned
The stomach did not contain any signs of
poison.
Hugh Grant, the attorney who was on
friendly terms with Eleanor Fuller and
who bought her a dress Just prior to her
disappearance, was sent for yesterday by
Captain Seymour. The chief of detectives
questioned the lawyer very closely for
over an hour, but he made satisfactory
explanations of his connection with the
matter.
Peking at 1 o'clock on the afternoon the
girl disappeared, dispelled all theories cal
culated to connect him with the murder.
j Mr. Gillen was then taken by a Call re
porter to the residence of Emil F, Ber
trand, at 1615 O'Farrell street, where both
again told their stories. Mr. Bertrand
maintained that on January 10 he cleaned
out the whole house, not omitting a room.
He again visited the house on January
18 and 25, making a thorough tour of
every room, and declares positively that
nothing was in any room. This evidence
shows that Bertrand either missed a
room or that the bed and mattress were
not taken to the house until after Jan
uary 25.
After leaving the house Gillen drove
Â¦, the boy in the wagon up to Devisadero
street Â¦ and from there went home. He
places the time of his arrival at. the house
as five minutes before 6 b!clock. .The
street lamps had not yet been lit, so it
Â¦was Quite dark. "' . â¢ â¢
On arriving- at the house Gillen thought
that he had mistaken the number, as
there was no light there. He. rang the
bell twice and was about to go next door
Â¦to gain Information when he heard steps
in the hall and the door opened, exposing
to view In the darkness the outline of a
man about 5 feet 6 Inches in height,
wearing a ellk hat and a frock or Prince
Albert coat. He places the man's weight
at about 160 pounds and his age between
â¢40 and 50. The only feature recognizable
by Gillen was a close cut mustache of a
dark color. This is all the description ;he
could give. Giilen asked the man if he
jras expecting goods from a Mission-street
house, as he had forgotten to look at the
check bill. The man asked if he meant
Cavanaugh's and he replied that he did.
'Continuing, Gillen said, "I had orders to
take the things upstairs, but he told me
to leave them right there In the hall.. 1
.asked him why he didn't light .the hall
gas, so that I could see to sign.- the bill,
Â¦put he said the gas had not yet been
â¢turned on. He stood with an umbrella in
:his hand and seemed in a hurry to leave
-the house. As I got into the wagon I
heard the door slam, as , though he hai
gone Into the house. I then heard it slam
again, and although I did not see him I
am positive that he left the house imme
diately."
. A young fellow whom Gillen did not
know asked him for a ride and rode out
with him, as he lived on Devisadero
street, but as he remained in the wagon
while Gillen carried the things into the
-house he did not see the tenant of the
Chouse.
The premises In which j the dead body
of Eleanor Fuller was found were viewed
yesterday by Larry C. Gillen of 241 Fifth
street for the' purpose of determining
whether it was at this house that he de
livered the bedding which was found
therein. Mr. Gillen found that it was at
this house, 2211 Sutter street, that he de
livered for Dealer Cavanaugh. the mat
tress, quilt and blankets which were pur
chased from him by Hawkins, who told
the dealer his name was Scott.. . Gillen
had Just got back on the eve of Jan

about to put up the horse when ordered
to take the previously named articles out
to 2211 Sutter street. The man who pur

MISS EMMA SEARIGHT was
seen at the residence of Mr?.
A. TV. Forbes, 2123 Sacramento
street, yesterday afternoon, and
denied emphatically that she
had ever seen or been, with Miss Eleanor
Fuller since her disappearance. She said
that she had. not seen the girl since she
(Miss Searight) quit work at Hale's store
on December 24 last.
Miss Searight met Eleanor Fuller in a
casual way one day while at the office
of Hugh C. Grant In the Emma Spreckels
building:, with her father, William Sea
right.
She was Introduced by Attorney Grant
and of course greeted the stranger as
any one would and told her that she was
in the perfumery department of Hale's
and that any time she was down there to
call around and get a sample of the per
fumes. It seems that the girl called
at Sale's three or four times and nothing
passed between them further than girlish
talk. After leaving Hale's Miss Searight
never saw the girl again. This was on
December 24. Miss Searlght' s mother is
dead and she resides with Mrs. A. "W.
Forbes, 2123 Sacramento street, a lady
who for years has taken great interest in
Emma and vouches for all that she says.
Mrs. Forbes cannot account for the rea
son why Kmma. should be selected as
knowing anything about the dead girl,
knowing her only so slightly as she did.
She thinks that the dead girl's school
mates would be mote likely to know
something of value to the authorities.
It is probable that Eleanor Fuller, after
having a sample of perfume put on her
dress at Male's, 'went home and her
mother, noticing the odor, may have
asked her where she obtained it. This
Is the theory advanced by Mrs. Forbes
as to Mrs. Fuller's knowledge of Alias

E. F. Bertrand, the locksmith who does

Is certain there -was no furniture in the
house on any of these occasions.
"There Is no chance for me to "be mis
taken," he said, "for on these visits as
is my custom I Inspected, the house thor
oughly 'and examined every room. I
locked the windows on leaving. My visit
on the 10th was on* orders from the real
estate firm to clean the premises, that is,
to remove the rubbish from the rooms.
"Before leaving the house I took the
globes from the parlor chandeliers and
locked them in a closet In the front bed
room upstairs. On the lSth I noticed that
the globes were taken from the closet and
placed in position on the fixtures in the
room where the girl's body was after
ward found. I paid no particular atten

from my mind, believing that some one
who had the right to do so had placed
the globes there.
"There is certainly a mistake on the
part of the furniture man If he says that
he delivered any furniture to the house
before the 23th. As I recall my visits to
the house I am unmistakably certain that
I followed my custom on these occasions
and -went through, every room and even
the basement. If there had been any ar
ticles of furniture in the house, especially
as many as were subsequently found In
that room, I would have noticed them,
and to fulfill my mission I would have
reported the matter to the agents.
"The more I think of the affair the

least doubt in my. mind."

â¢â¢Dear Sirs: Tours of thÂ« 19th received and
I thank you for your information regarding the
Diabetes medicine made by J. J. Fulton. I was
permanently cured of Diabetes by this medi-
cine, and I now enjoy good health once more.
I commenced taking It March 3d and June 3th
was pronounced cured. I now enjoy my old
diet in a mild form, but advance, more on It aa
time goes by, not wishing to attempt too much
at once. I was very bad with the disease. Tie*
gravity was 1WÂ«. Â«n d I wa Â» s Â° weak that I
could scarcely walk. The physicians helped ma
some, but said there was no cure. I then heard
of and went to treating with the Fulton Cdm-
pound. and only took three bottles when I
commenced to feel better, and then kept on Im-
proving until I was restored to health.
"1 know of another case of Diabetes, an en-
gineer on the road, who had tha disease for four
years. Ha went to Tucson to die. â¢When I was
getting better I sent for him to coma to Sacra-
mento to so on the same treatment. On hU
return he believed no medicine would cure him.
But I prevailed upon him to try it.' This was
in May. He Is now 30 much improved that ha
Is on his engine working every day. There are
also two cases of Bright' s Disease takine It
whom I told of it. I hope some syndicate will
get this medicine and build sanitariums all
over the country for the treatment of these
dreadful diseases. Trusting I have nc*- said
too much, youra,

Upon hearing that Charles A. Newton,
the yardmaster of the Southern Pacifia
Company at Sacramento, had a certain
case of Diabetes, the business men who
were Investigating the Fulton Compounds
wrote him asking him to take it. But
they were late, as he had already heard
of it, as per his letter In answer, as fol-

"I met Serebrenek last May," Mrs. Ful
ler replied. "He came from China, bear
ing a letter from my brother, whose name
is Cooper. My brother and Serebrenek
are both employed by the same mercantile
house. The Count went to Russia and re-
"Nora was such a good, good girl." she
paid. "I am sure that she was cruelly
murdered in her attempt to secure her
freedom and come home to us. I do hone
that the police will search the house
where Ehe was murdered from top to
bottom. I think that she might have even
taken a pin and scratched a farewell mes
gage on the wall. She might have con
cealed a note somewhere in her clothes.
Pleaso ask the police to make diligent
search of the house and of her garments."
Mrs. Fuller said she did not remember
whether she saw Bennett's "want ad" in
the paper first or whether Nora called her
attention to it. It has been suggested
that Nora knew the advertisement was to
appear.
"Will you tell how you became acquaint
ed with Count Serebrenek, the Russian,
st the Palace Hotel?" was asked of Mrs.
Fuller.
"You must not go down and see it,"
he said. "You are not strong enough to
bear the shock."
Ever since Nora Fuller disappeared her
mother has had hopes that some day ehe
would return to her home safe and sound.
Her room had been kept In readiness for
her. The little white Iron bedstead with
Its dainty pink quilt, the pictures and cal
endars on the wallâ just such as a girl
of 15 would selectâ are all as. she left
them weeks ago. On the table near the
bed is a handsomely bound Bible and near
it a copy of one of Nora's favorite songs.
Mrs. Fuller says that she would never
be happy until she knows that the mur
derer of her daughter had been brought
to justice for his cruel crime.
A pathetic incident occurred yesterday
â¢when Lewis J. Parlane, the brother of the
murdered girl, returned from the Morgue
and told his waiting- mother^ that there
was ao longer any doubt that the body
at the Morgue was that of Nora.
Mrs. Alice Maud Fuller, mother of the
girl whose dead body was found in the
house at 2211 Sutter street. Is down with
nervous prostration at her home, 14H St.
Rose'a avenue. The mental anguish suf
fered by her during the period of Bearch
for the missing Nora and the shock that
came with the ghastly find In the silent
back room of the deserted house on gut
ter street have been too much for the'
stricken parent to stand. Kind and sym
pathetic neighbors waited on her yester
day, but at every sound at the front door
bell Mrs. Fuller would spring up In bed
and ask if there was any fresh news, or
if they had succeeded In graining a clew
to the supposed murderer.
Says Serebrenek Sailed on
Same Day Jhat Nora
Disappeared.
MRS. FULLER IS
CONFINED TO BED
The fellow became so emphatic In his
remarks about how to be a successful
detective Uiat Captain Seymour finally
had to drive him from his office. *
"That Is the only way to get at the
bottom of this awful crime," he remarked
â¢with the air of an experienced sleuth.
"Bring them all in and you will have lit
tle trouble in picking out the murderer."
TThlle the crowd of morbid visitors was
viewing the remains Captain of Detectives
Seymour waa busy in his office listening
to suggestions from various people who
thouglit they had & clew to the mur
derer. A poorly clad individual, who im
agined he was a Sherlock Holmes, tried
to impress the head of the detective de
partment with the necessity of arresting
every suspicious character In the city.
Many Suggestions by Sleuths.
"I can't 6tand it," she tearfully ex
claimed. "My God, who could have slain
such a beautiful girl! I have daughters
of ray own, and the very thought that
one of them, might meet the same fate as
this poor child makes me 11L I pity her
mother and pray to heaven that the fiend
â¢who strangled her will soon meet his
fate."
The old lady was taken upstairs to
â¢where the Â¦ body lay on a slab. As she
looked on the discolored face of the mur
dered girl her eyes filled with tears and
she requested the deputy to escort her
from the place.
An elderly â¢woman, dressed in black,
accosted one of the deputies and asked
permission to 6ee the body.
"Did you know her?" asked the deputy.
'"Well, no. I did not." she answered.
"but I would like to see the remains."
Several other people whe knew the pirl
In her lifetime after viewing- the remains
positively identified them, as those of
Nora Fuller.
Others Identify Bemains.
"Yes, those are Nora's garments," he
sadly said, pointing to the heap of cloth
ing found In the house in which the un
fortunate girl had met her death. "I am
thoroughly satisfied that the body in the
Morgue is that of my poor sister."
To complete the identification Parlane
Â¦was taken to police headquarters and
enown the clothes which, had been worn
by the dead girl.
remains of the unfortunate Nora
Fuller. Shortly after 2 o'clock Lewis
Parlane, the brother of the murdered
girl, visited the Morgue to identify the
remains. He at first was In doubt as to
whether the body was that of his sister,
but on seeing a vaccination mark on her
left calf he exclaimed, "Yes. that is poor
Nora; there can be no mistake about it."

FEW NEW CLEWS
The house at 2211 Sutter street, in which
poor Nora Fuller met * her death, consists
of four rooms on the lower floor and
four on the upper. The 'approach,from
the street Is â¢ up a flight of about
ten steps, and the doors open into
a hallway from which runs the flight
â¢of stairs leading to the upper story. On
"The murder of this young girl Is a ter
rible affair /and it has affected , me very
much*. My relations with Mrs. Fuller are
not as friendly as, they were a few weeks
ago. I took my daughter away from her
house and placed her with some friends
of mine named Whitney.; Mrs. Fuller has
also asked to. substitute another attorney
to act' for | her in . my place. ._ There has
been no great difference In our, relations,'
only. that I think Mrs. Fuller, did not like
my action in removing my, daughter from
her house, i. I cannot' throw any light on
this terrible affair. 'I; saw, the police to
dayand, gave them every Information , it
was ;in my power ; to > give. I hope ; that
this crime will be sifted to . the bottom
and the' murderer of /- Eleanor "Fuller
caught and punished." ,',
"From what I j saw .of Eleanor .; Fuller
she impressed me as being a quiet; and
well-behaved 'girl, and one who is not
likely to make chance acquaintances with
strange menl . )
"I'do not. know the man named Sere
breneck, who was stopping at the Palace
Hotel and who Is supposed to be a friend
of Eleanor Fuller's uncle. I do not know
any man named Hawkins or Jennings
that the murdered girl might have known.
"I first became acquainted with Mrs.
Fuller three years ago, when she retained
me as her attorney. Her daughter Eleanor
has often visited my office bringing mes
sages and notes from her mother concern-
Ing legal business. The girl often dropped
in to get car fare from me. As regards
the statement that I bought a dress for
the girl, there has been some misappre
hension. My daughter Ethel was boarding
with Mrs. Fuller and I noticed that Elean
or Fuller was not as well dressed as she
should be. I told Mrs. Fuller that the
child ought to have a new dress and I
gave her $12 50 to get one for the chttJ.
The amount was credited to my account
for the board of my daughter with 'Mrs.
Fuller.
â¢Tt never took the child of Mrs. Fuller
to a theater or to a restaurant, and I do
not know, of any men that Eleanor Fuller
was acquainted with. The last time I saw
Eleanor Fuller alive was just before
Christmas. .
"I ', looked at the face' of the dead gir!
carefully," said Grant last evening, "and
with the Identification of the clothing
found near the body, I am now positive
that the remains are those of Eleanor Fut
ler.
Grant M r as well .acquainted with the
unfortunate girl, and his identification of
the body was positive. The attorney had
visited the Morgue in the early hours of
yesterday morning and at that time he
had some hesitation in saying that the
body found in the house at 2211 Sutter
street was that of Eleanor.
Attorney Hugh C. Grant, who has at
tended to the legal business of Mrs. Ful
ler, the mother of the murdered girl,
called at the Morgue yesterday to see' the
body of Eleanor Fuller. ' _ ,
He Tells of His Connection
With the Fuller
Family.
"Yes, Ehe worked during the months of
October and November of last year for a
family at a private hotel, taking care of
children," the bereaved mother replied.
"When she answered the\advertlsement
lust before she disappeared she and 1 de
cided that she should come home and sleep
every night."
turned In January- He arrived, I believe,
on a Wednesday, and the Friday following
I called on him at the Palace Hotel, ac
companied by my daughter Nora. He
sailed on the City of Peking at 1 P- m..
January 11. for China. That was the day
my daughter disappeared. My son, Lewis
J. Parlane, went down to the wharf and
saw the Count depart."
"When did you first meet Hugh C.
Grant, and how did you happen to em
ploy him as your attorney?" was asked.
"I was having considerable legal work
done in connection with my divorce," Mrs.
Fuller replied, "and the attorneys I was
employing did not give me satisfaction.
I casually noticed an advertisement in
some paper of Attorney Grant and I was
impressed with the name, as I once had
a dear friend by that name. I called on
him and he attended to my legal work.
During the months of July and August
I boarded his 11-year-old daughter Ethel
at her father's request. Grant never
paid me In full for the board of the
child and was in debt to me for this ar
rangement. I can thus easily explain
Nora's going into his office and borrow
ing car fare from him. Grant used to
come out to the house, but I am not aware
that he ever went out with Nora. Grant
and Count Serebrenek never met and were
not acquainted.
"The papers said to-day that Nora was
sixteen. This Is a mistake. She was only
fifteen and a half, and she looked mores
like fourteen than her real age. She was
a very studious girl, and the only time
that she went down town was to exchange
books at the Free Public Library."
"Did your daughter ever work at any
time?" was asked* of Mrs. Fuller.
The washstand in the bathroom gives
no evidence of having been used lately.
Neither is there any evidence of the house
having, been occupied for any length of
time. Had the occupants had their meals
sent in, or had they purchased a cold
meal at a delicacy store, some trace of
paper, twine or wooden pla'tes would have
been found. :-
. An examination of the premises was
made yesterday by the detectives and
others, but not the slightest trace of a
late occupancy was found. The flues in
the grates and. chimneys were filled with
old papers, some of them bearing, dates
of two years ago. The detectives tore up
the toilet and took out the contents of
the trap, that an examination might be
made, that a scrap of writing, poison bot T
tie. or other clew might be revealed.
: Many of the houses in the immediate
vicinity overlook from the rear the room
in which the girl's body was found; yet
a. patient "inquiry among the neighbors
did not result in the finding of any one
who ever saw a light or heard a noise In
the house after the - previous occupants
moved out about the first of the year.
The house is built onto the one next to it
and the partition between the two is of
such -lightness that; any unusual noise in
the one could be heard in the other. The
iesidents of the houses on either side of
that in which the body was found are
positive in 'their declaration that they
never saw any one in or about the prem
ises or saw any lights at any v time in thÂ«
house.
The walls are papered In red and give
evidence that at one time the room
might have been occupied as a kitchen.
Tack marks in the wall seem to show
that a strip of some material was put in
the wall to protect it from injury. There
Is a daub of grease on one of the widths
of the paper, which is evidently of long
standing.
the lower floor is a front and back par
lor, a kitchen and servants' room. On
the second floor is a front and side bed
room, a bathroom and fear bedroom. It
was in this latter. room that the body of
the girl was found.

At a meeting of the executive commit
tee of the; StJ Patrick's day. celebration
held at 1133 Mission street yesterday it
was decided to hold two celebrations, one
in. the afternoon y arid the ' other in .the

as orator of the day. The following com
mittees were appointed:

membrane connecting the twins
contained three large . arteries, and the
patients lost between one and two ounces
of , blood. The only complaint they made
was that they, felt patn in the membrane.
They were very weak and had some fever.
At last. reports they .both were sleeping
quietly. Â¦ . . .
:. The Figaro publishes an interview with
Dr. 'Doyen, who after explaining that the
operation .was undertaken, under excep
tionally unfavorable circumstances, . as
both;the twins were attacked by tubercu
losis and almost dying, describes the op
eration, which was performed under anes
thetics. â¢ ' The membrane was composed of
stretched tissues,' which soon contracted.
The iteration will leave only a - Btraight

PARIS, Feb. 9.-The Hindoo twins, Ra
dica and.Dordina,\.who were united In a
manner similar to the Siamese twins, who
were exhibited throughout the world, were
separated -to-day 'by Or. Doyen. The op
eration lasted twenty minutes^ and was
successful, but owlnsr to the weak condi
tion of the patients, due to illness, the
final result is still doubtful.
r Charles Feitz, the fireman, went down
with the engine and was killed,' after un
dergoing terrible suffering. He was
caught between the locomotive boiler
and an upset boxcar,/ and slowly, burned
to death within sight of a rescue jj party
which was making .every possible effort
to save him. A. H. Montgomery, 'the
engineer of the train, jumped from his
cab as- the engine struck the slide.' fle
was badly shaken Â¦ up by the fall, . but
otherwise â¢ uninjured. Â¦ There- were no
other casualties. ; : "'- - * ; .
No one appears to be blamed' for the
accident. The tracks had been patrolled
as usual and the elide must have: came
down .within a very short time prior to
the arrival of ] the train. The ; train was
.made up of sixteen cars of mixed freight."
All the cars were Â¦ derailed; but only the
first five" followed the locomotive into the
lake. The track was blocked for fifteen
hours, but this afternoon . the slide, and
another found a .few miles above it, < were
cleared -away and traffic was resumed.- â¢>
The wreck occurred about fifteen miles
north of Seattle. The train had left this
city shortly after 11 o'clock.^ In rounding
a sharp; curve at :the head of .the Jake
the big slide came suddenly, into view and
in an instant the engine ' had plowed j into
it. overturned and plunged into the water.
Montgomery jumped;', but Feitz went
down. 1 He tried to > crawl out of the water
over the 'hot boiler, but one" of the box
cars ' suddenly piled on ,Â¦ top and fastened
him down by, an- arm. -~ V . ->'â¢/Â» .
Â¦ The ' conductor, : engineer and others of
the train crew hastened to him. and found
it impossible to extricate " him. â¢ After a
moment or two it was decided* that ' his
arm must be chopped off, but before tins
could -ba - done ?Â¦ the. >, terrific â¢ heat , of â¢: the
.boiler, against which he was Â¦ pinned, . had
overcome him and . he was dead. . Feitz
was 26 years old â¢ and had relatives living
in Wayland, ilowa. -The remains will be
shipped there. ,\ - - \ ,
.SEATTLE, Feb. -9.â An engine" and five
cars on the Seattle division of .'the
Northern Pacific ran'.into a heavy land
slide at the north end of Lake Washing
to.t early this morning and plunged-'into
the waters of the lake. . . Â¦
Now, whether the coffin the. decedent
was so particular should be of the right
size will be used, is ai question. In the
present storm with the many intervening
swollen creeks it is considered almost im
possible to get. the remains to Big Bend
where the coffln stands ready in a corner
of the cabin.. The mail stages . cannot
cover the Big Bend route. The relatives
would like to carry out the desires of
Hudson, but it is probable that the re
mains will' be laid away in the Redding
cemetery in a more, modern casket. '.
Hudson gradually grew worse. Â¦'": His left
forearm and the heel of one of : his feet
seemed to be dying. Gangrene began in
one of those parts. After much effort
Hudson was induced to permit himself to
be conveyed to Redding to undergo an
operation. The surgeon's work was done
several days ago and Hudson, succumbed
to-day. . : . , -..Â¦â¢. .
When he became bedridden several
months ago he decided that death was
near. His preparations for .its coming
were practical rather than spiritual. He
sent for a carpenter and had his measure
taken ' for a coffin. He was particular
about the fit, and so tried it. .The coffln
was a rough box of inch boards,' but it
satisfied the man who had ordered it.
Hudson was a farmer of the Big Bend
region, forty-five miles northeast of here.
He had a, wife and several children there.
For a considerable . time he was ill, but
scorned to have a physician. He would
have no "quacks" around, he said, and
pinned his faith In patent medicines.
REDDING, Feb. 9â S.B. Hudson of this
county had a coffin made to measure for
himself some time ago, and now that he is
dead the elements may cheat him out of
its use. :.'' 'Â¦;â¢'Â¦ ~ f
If the river continues to rise this Â¦ off
spring Â¦ will be impassable Â¦Â¦ to-morrow.
Then the vast territory lying north and
east of the Sacramento River in Shasta,
Modoc and Lassen Counties will be cut
off from communication with Redding.
The ferry across the stream at the north
edge of town is not being run, as the
owners dare not truest the boats in the
torrent. The river has risen so high that
it has run around' the east end of the
bridge located at the southeast corner of
Redding's corporate limits/- â¢ The waters
form, a veritable mill-race over a flat
100' yards in width. - It was crossed to-day
with but scant safety by. vehicles. â¢. â¢
RBDDIXG, Feb. ?.â After a week of
steady drizzle 2.99 inches of rain fell here
during the past forty-eight hours. A lib
eral downpour is in progress this evening,
with every prospect of continuing Indefi
nitely. Mail stages on several routes are
tied up and all routes will be closed if the
storm continues much longer, owing to
high water in the many creeks of this
northern country. No fatality by drown
ing, which generally marks similar storms,
has yet been reported.-
The mail stages between Redding and
Bleber, Lassen County, by way of Fall
River Mills, have not gotten through for
two days, nor have the stages from this
city to Bully Hill and Copper City, distant
twenty-six miles northeast, although the
mail contractor sent out a stage from
here this morning in an attempt to get
through the storm-swollen creeks. â¢â¢
The Weaverville. Trinity County, stage
got in last night with its mail, although
it was held up for two hours at Salt
Creek, on the outskirts of Redding. - The
stages to Harrison â¢ Gulch, fifty-six miles
southwest, are . the only ones going
through on time. They will be tied up if
the storm continues.
DEATH IGNORES
HIS FINAL WISH
HINDOO TWINS

Throughout those times the Jew had no
civil' rights, yet he was recognized as a
man, and the master of the Jew-slave had
to give him sufficient food and ample rai
ment. The pagans made poverty a crime,
and -when they condescended to dole out
charity they threw their gifts at the sup
plicant. The pastimes of the pagan were
noted for the orgies and abominable
crime, while they took a delight in crush
ing out all humanity from the hearts of
the people. J The Jews said, in the light of
all this, that they must live as a protest
against degradation and wanton cruelty,
and they set out on their task to win
over the pagan by words of love. They
showed him that as God was merciful
man must be merciful, and as God was
holy eo.man must be. It was that beau
tiful sentiment that drew many from pa
ganism. The philanthropic and humane
.societies of to-day breathed the very
spirit of Judaism. Â¦ By purity of love; by
charity and goodness, % said . the lecturer,
we can show our service to mankind and
to God, the author of all.
The Rev. Dr. Myers delivered a lecture
at the Bush-street Synagogue last even
ing before a large and deeply interested
congregation. The subject of the dis
course was "Judaism and Paganism," in
which It was shown that the rabbis of Is
rael inculcated three principles, which be
came the prevailing characteristics of
Jewsâ modesty, mercy and active good
ness. While there were slaves In the
heathen da'ys of Rome, the Jew was less
at the command and the will of the slave
owners than others were. He taught and
discussed everywhere the doctrine of for
bearance, of brotherly, love,' of charity
and morality. In that perjod there was no
such condition as equality among men.
The slaves were composed of men of al
most all nations, and the pagans chose
from their ranks subjects for the arena,
where they were torn to pieces by wild
beasts for the amusement and edification
of the bloodthirsty Romansâ the pagans.

URGES REMEDIES
FOR HOST EVILS
BERKELEY. Feb. 9.â Mrs. Annie Pe
terson has remained in charge of her
classics in the Columbus School, Berke
ley, until within a week In spite of the
School Board rule prohibiting the: em
ployment of married women as teachers.
Mrs.' Peterson has been Miss*Annie Pyne
on. the list of teachers, although she was
married secretly to Henry Peterson; >. a
West Berkeley carriage-maker, in Salinas
last June. - â¢ . -- . .â¢' Â¦;
At that time the young people conclud
ed not to wait any longer for the perform
ance of the ceremony. But Miss Pyne
was not ready to give up her position. In
this dilemma the couple determined on a
secret marriage, A trip to Salinas was
arranged and a quiet wedding solemnized
in the Presbyterian Church at that place.
After the knot was tied the bride re
turned to Â¦ her father's house to remain
there as usual, until yesterday, when sKe
I went to: join her husband in the new
home he has been making ready in the
meantime. The announcement of her
marriage just before leaving came with
as much surprise to her family as to thÂ«
School Board, who discovered that they
had been .for six months unwittingly
breaking one of their own rules. Mrs.
Peterson's resignation from the 1 depart
ment, was promptly accepted.

DEVILS AND BIRDS OF EVIL TAKE
THEIR DEPARTURE FROM CHINATOWN
By Sally Sharp.
THE arrival of Mrs. Herman Oel
richs and little son from New York
has occasioned many a ripple of in
terest in society. The party in-
eludes eight liveried sen-ants, three
berlbboned. dogs and twenty-two good
tized trunks. Mrs. Oelrichs is always in
teresting and now that she comes to us
fresh from her social reign in Gotham,
and just after being so happily classified
in the Rev. Dr. Charles Wilbur de Lyon
Nichols* revised list of aristocracy, we
are more in a flutter than ever. Dr. Nich
ols himself made something of a stir in
cutting down Ward McAllister's "400" list
to 145 in New York and adding only two or
three families in other cities. The only
remaining fortunates In San Francisco
lucky enough to be so listed are Mr. and
Mrs. John W. Mackay, Mr. and Mrs,
George Crocker and Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd
Tevis. Mrs. Oelrichs is therefore decid
edly an object of envy Just now, and it is
a. question whether the slv weeks' peni
tence of the Lenten season will do away
With it. ....
If Lent were not so close at hand and
Mrs. Oelrichs not so fatigued by the de
mands upon her time in the Katt, she
would appear In some of the contents of
the twenty-two trunks. Mrs. Oelrichs
knows bo well how to carry the Paris
creations which float across the pond to
her. She has a style quite her own.
' It is difficult to decide whether the event
of Tuesday evening is the festive Mardi
Gras ball or the beautiful Pond-Painter
wedding. The dear girls are trying: to ar
range some way to do both delightful af
fairs in the same evening. A number of
our younger set attended the Clark-Mul
lins church wedding, tiled an appearance
at the home reception and arrived at the
Huntington dance as fresh as roses by II
o'clock. But as the Mardi Gras grand
march begins at 10â an hour earlierâ the
fair ones are certainly confronted by a
condition. Then to make the obstacle
more formidable, many of those In the
gmart set are promised at some of the
dinners to be given preceding the ball. It
looks now as though we must devise a Cin
derella affair for the dinner and wedding,
which, upon pulling a string, may be deft
ly shed at 10 o'clock, disclosing the happy
Mardi Gras costume underneath. How
athletic we must all become on that
eventful day, for I haven't said' a word
yet about the luncheons and teas after the
Monday receptions, luncheons, teas, din
ners. Presidio hop and Folger cotillon.
Strong coffee and port wine are tiding
some of the debutantes over Ash Wed
nesday, for, tired as they are, they
would not miss anything in the social
whirl for worlds.
Speaking of the Pond-Painter wedding,
everybody ia delighted to know that the
groom has been building a cozy little
home for his new wife. Those who know
Miss Phoebe Painter feel that her bright
smiles and practical helpfulness are ex
actly what we want to keep always with
us. The beautiful and extensive array
of wedding presents that have been re
ceived will go far toward feathering the
new home nest of the happy couple.
Let us bear in mind that Mr. and Mrs.
J. Athearn Folger are to have their guests
dance a cotillon before supper this even
ing. Every one will be at Native Sons'
Hall at the appointed time. Mr. Folger
will lead the german. I have heard that
the favors are beautiful and have been
especially procured from Paris and New
York for this occasion. Elaborate fans,
flowers, wands, hats, etc., will make glad
the hearts of the guests.
Mrs. Linda H. Bryan. Miss Rowena
Burns and Miss Mabel Toy sailed away
on Saturday for Mexico, where they will
spend a happy six weeks at Mazatlan. the
comfortable and artistic home of Mrs.
Bryan's mother. Mrs. Bryan's two chil
dren completed the party, while the eldest
boy is already in Vazatlan. We know
Mrs. Bryan as one of those rare and
charming women who does society
in its happiest sense without neglecting
her children. She is devotion itself to her
little brood and laughingly says that the
only thing that troubles her is the fact
that she hadn't half enough.
Apropos of birdlings. what scores of
telegrams have been showered upon Mrs.
Hugh Tevis. nee Baxter, at Monterey,
upon the arrival of her little son. The
sudden death of Hugh Tevis while on his
wedding trip was a terrible blow to the
young girl, and preparations for the little
visitor have proved a great comfort to
her, and it Is hoped that time will restore
her old-time happiness.
Jlr. and Mrs. James Follis have had
their fcome gladdened by the visit of the
stork, and Mr. and Mrs. Paxton Howard
are also receiving congratulations for
similar good fortune.
E.-ery one is talking about that airy
fairy-Lillian gown worn at the last
Jeunesse by Miss Elsie Sperry. Miss
Sperry is always faultlessly attired, but
this latest creation is worthy of special
mention. The material was filmy white
chiffon over white silk with garniture of
the pinkest of apple blossoms. The bod
ice was cut decidedly decollete with a
transparent net yoke, dotted here and
there with tiny apple blossoms. The
frou-frou flounces of chiffon in the skirt
were festooned with clusters of the blos
soms and the effect was beautifully ar
tistic.
LENTEN SEASON
IS PRECEDED BY
SATURDAY TEAS
â¢ Saturday teas are still making their
jjresence felt before the beginning of
I^ent. One of the prettiest affairs of this
nature was the Simpson tea, given
by Mrs. John Simpson, at 2520
Vallejo street, complimentary to her
youngest . daughter, Margaret. More
than "00 guests were received between the
hours of 4 and 6 o'clock, and delightfully
entertained. The decorations were un
usually fine. The dining-room was a
bower of green, with an abundance of
American Beauty roses and red carna
tions. There was also red condelabra
carrying out the colors of red and green
Â¦with artistic effect. The hall was also
lavishly decorated with American Beau
ties and red carnations. Bridesmaid roses
! were the principal feature of the pink
color scheme carried out in the reception
room, while the music-room was done in
carnations of all colors and shades avail
able. Miss Margaret Simpson was also
the recipient of many flowers from her
friends. Good music by the orchestra and
dainty refreshments added much to the
pleasure of the afternoon.
It will be remembered that Miss Mar

Three Hundred Thousand Dollar
, Three relief meetings were held during
-the afternoon, the principal one of which
was attended by Governor Murphy and
Mayor Hinchcliffe. In a few moments $800
was handed to th* Mayor for immediate
use. but the chief magistrate said that
while the city had suffered a terrible visi
tation, he was in a position to say that
there was very little distress. The busi
ness section of the city had been practi
cally wiped out. but the residence portion
which suffered was that In which well
to-do citizens lived.
Despite the precaution of the authori
ties, there is much confusion in the
streets to-night. The destruction of wires
,left the city In darkness, save for the dull
glow given off by the acres of embers in
the two great fire areas. Hundreds of be
lated visitors crowded around the depots
and struggled in the dark for places in the
overcrowded trains. The street railway
system was badly damaged through the
burning of its wires.
Early .In the day the Â¦ Mayor, issued, an
order forbidding the sale of liquor. "It was
Householders and property owners with

To check disorder and prevent crime,

upon the public streets of the city of Pat
erson, within the limits of the burned dis
trict, after the hour of 7 o'clock p. m., and
any person refusing or neglecting to obey
this proclamation shall be subject to ar
rest and punishment.
Move to Prevent Crime.
Great pinnacles of ruined brick stood
in every street, but the crowds passed
under them unmindful of the warlngs of
police and firemen. With the crowds came
thieves and looters, but there was not
much pillagring. Under orders from Gov
ernor Murphy, Companies A, C, K and M
of the Fifth Infantry, National Guard, as
sembled at their armories and were held
as a reserve force. The police, deputy
Sheriffs, hundreds of special watchmen
and firemen united In protecting property
during the day.
Paterson rests in a valley and the con
flagration was an imposing spectacle from
the hills that wall it in. Columns of flame
climbed high into the air and shed- their
light for miles. Hundreds of persons
hurried into the city, before daylight to
watch the work of destruction at close
range, and when the day came thousands
more Joined them. The fire became a
great popular spectacle that claimed pa
trons from New Tork and every outlying
town in New Jersey. They crowded the
regular trains of the railways operating
through here and compelled the dispatch
ing of extra trains.. Once In the city they
crowded around the firemen and at times
hampered them in their work. Police lines
were impossible and through the day they
poured In an endless stream through the
desolate streets.
Sightseers Pour Into City.
The final and one of the most desperate
fights of the day occurred in mid-after
noon, back in the first fire area, at the
Hamilton Club, situated at the corner of
Church of Ellison streets. The handsome
clubhouse caught and the exhausted fire
men were rallied around it. They were
anxious to save the structure, and, besides,
failure meant that the fire might take new
headway among the properties adjoining
the clubhouse. The building was doomed,
but a torrent of water kept the fire con
fined to the premises. The four walls of
the clubhouse stood, but the roof collapsed
and the interior was completely burned
out.
This second great fire started at the
angle of Park avenue and Washington
street and swept almost unchecked until
on these two thoroughfares there was no
more fuel. On the right hand side of Mar
ket street it encountered Sandy Hill ceme
tery as a barrier to check it, but on the
left hand side, at Carroll street, it claimed
St. Joseph's Church, a great classic stone
building. It was on this second great fire
that the volunteer firemen from the out
side cities did their most heroic and ef
fective work. They fell back only when
they had to and when the natural obsta
cle interposed they seized their chance
and stopped the fire.
Fire Stops at Cemetery.
There was a "series of explosions and
scores of walls fell when the fire left them
strengthless. Flying firebrands carried
the conflagration over some buildings and
around others, and it therefore burned in
an irregular gpurse. Those brands finally
cleared the tracks of the Erie railway and
Ramapo avenue, and alighting on Straight
street started another great area of fire,
in which the destruction and desolation
wrought was nearly as great as in the
other.
Main street was soon arched over by a
canopy of fire for a block and then for
two blocks, as the flames fastened them
selves upon 'building after building. The
firemen fought with every resource of
their craft and the impulse of despera
tion, but the flames found new avenues
In Ellison and Market streets and got
beyond all control.
Calls for relief went out to every city
In this portion of the country and the
jaded firemen labored on through the
hopeless hours of the morning. The City
Hall, a maflnificent structure, surmount
ed by a great clock tower, situated on
Washington. Ellison and Market streets,
finally caught, and with it went all of the
splendid business structures that sur
rounded it. They made a great furnace of
fire that burned .with a fierce. roar.
Flames Raze the City Hall.
The firemen tried to hem in . the blaze,
but it speedily crossed Van Houten street
in one direction and Main street In an
other and, gaining vigor as it went,
burned unchecked down into the business
district. Every piece of fire mechanism
In the city was called out, but the fire
and gale were masters.
A great torch of flames arose high in
the air, lighting up the country for many
miles and carrying a threat and a warn
ing to the people and property in its path.
There were efforts to rescue furniture
and stock, but the speed with which the
fire moved gave the rescuers little time.
Property was often moved to a place of
presumed safety, only to be eventually
reached and destroyed. The warning to
many was brief and they were forced to
flee, scantily clad, into streets glazed
over with ice and swept by the keen
winds.
The fire began its Â¦< work of destruction
at the power house of the Jersey City,
Hoboken and Paterson Â¦ Traction Com
pany, which fronted on Broadway and
extended a block to the rear, on Van
Houten street. It commenced in the car
shed and was burning fiercely when one
of the employes detected it. It was leap
ing through the roof and the gale was
lifting It in forks and swirls when the
fire apparatus came into the roadway at
Van Houten and Main streets.
An estimate made from a general In
spection of the smoldering ruins placed
the number of dwellings and apartment
houses destroyed at 500 and the number
of families left without shelter at 1000. A
re-estlmate, when order succeeds con

To-night most of. the guests have been
for in the list of dead, injured
'and escaped. Among, those unaccounted
for Is A. Goldberg, a stranger, who came
in late and went to bed without register
ing, and two students, whose names are
not known. It is not believed there are
any more bodies in the ruins, which have
been carefully searched. For this reason
it is believed the missing men will put in
an appearance.
J.- J. Lally, who. managed the hotel for
his brother-in-law, J. W. Gillam, had
rooms on the first floor. He said there
were four rooms on the first floor, nine on
the second and seven on the third. If all
the guests occupied their rooms thirty-six
persons, .including the. colored porter and
the chambermaid, were in the building
when it burned. 'Lally said he; had no
means of knowing just how many persons
were ! in the house - at â¢ the time the . fire
broke out. Some of them were in the
habit of staying out late, and it is possi
ble, all were not ~ there then: \ He was
awakened by hearing 'Cornelius Ryan,
one of the roomers, crying "Fire!" Lally
said he grabbed his clothing and money
and hurried into the hall, which was
ablaze, and without* stopping to dress
stepped out through the front door. Both
stairways were on fire and he barely had
time to get out. Lane, Ryan and a man
named Nicely escaped the same way. Tho
only way for the others -to get out alive
was through the windows, the burning
stairways cutting off their escape that
way. Some jumped and sustained injuries
more or less serious, while others who
took time to improvise ropes from their
bedclothing got down safely. .
After a short fight. the firemen got the
flames under controland, assisted by the
police, made a search of the ruins. The
first body found was that of John C. Lue
ders, who was killed by jumping from the
third story. His head waB"* crushed in.
The body of Lueders and those, of the oth
ers found later were taken to the Morgue,
where friends .and relatives identified
them. Sarah Harris was found on the
first floor. The remains of the other vic
tims were found in : their rooms, Â¦Â¦ where
they had been' suffocated or burned. .
All of the Bodies Recovered.
Almost everybody who got out suffered
some injury or was frost-bitten. Some
Â¦saved their clothing, which they carried
in their hands, but others were not bo for
tunate, jloslng everything. After some de
lay near-by houses were opened to the un
fortunates arid they were given shelter
from the biting cold weather. It was one
of the, coldest nights of the winter, the
ground being covered with ice and snow,
and; every one suffered from . exposure.
The suffering ones were put " under the
care of physicians. Harry . CUne, Walter
Johnson, Henry Robinson and an un
known man, who died later, were taken
to the City Hospital. ,. Robinson recovered
enough" to be taken home. The others
named will be laid up for some time.
scene the whole front of the building was
in flames and the interior was a seething
furnace. \ By that time all who escaped
death had got o,ut of the building by
Jumping from the windows or climbing
down ropes made of .bedclothes. A few
escaped from the ground floor through tha
front door. Some of j the escapes were
very narrw.
George Fitzmaurice, a fireman, who
had been acting as driver for Fire Chief
Stagg, is dying. He -was drivin~ an en
gine from Passaic, when the horses bolted
and before Fitzmaurice could get them
under control they brought the apparatus
against an electric pole and Fitzmaurice,

was hurled out upon his head. There is
no chance for his living.
Reuben Isllb, -while serving coffee to the
exhausted firemen, was hit on the head
byÂ« a felling beam and it is doubtful if he.
will recover. He was carried away^by the
firemen as they made their retreat from
the doomed schoolhouse.
Scores of persons were hurt and burner,
but the loss of life is not believed to be
great. Many persons are reported to be
missing, but in the excitement and fright
most of these are supposed to K ~ sepa
rated from their families and friends.
One death was reported as . a possible
outcome of the conflagration â a Mrs.
Brownâ who, it was said,- was more than
80 years old and who was removed- from
her residence, IS Broadway.just two doors
from where the fire started in- the car
sheds. She was taken to the residence of
a friend nearby shortly after Â¦Â¦ midnight
and died an hour later. It was said that
her death was hastened by the excitement
consequent on her nasty, removal to a
place of safety.
Many Persons Reported" Missing,
It was in its newest and best built'por
tions that Paterson suffered, though some
of the property" now lying in blackened
ruins had an interest which came with
age and usage. â¢ .
Nowhere was the scene of devastation
more marked than north of the Erie Riv
er, in the district bounded by Sixteenth
avenue and Market street. There was
simply nothing but ashes left to tell that
a busy and populous section of the city
had ever existed. *
On .Washington street, between Broad
way and Market street, there is 'nothing
left. . â¢
Church street is wiped out on its west
side between Ellison and Market streets,
as it is on the east side. â¢
Market street is a pile of ruins from
Main street to the Market-street church
on the north side and on the south side.
From Main street to Paterson, between
Van Houten and Market streets, there is
little left. On the block bounded by Main,
Ellison, Washington and Market streets
not a single . building except that of the
Paterson Savings Institution stands. All
along the west side of Main street prop
erty is wiped out. as it is on the east side
from Market to Van Houten streets."
Along the south side of Broadway, be

great damage has been done. Â¦ : .
Van Houten street is reduced to smol
dering debris, as far as buildings are con
cerned, for some distance.
Ellison street suffered from the neigh
borhood of Prospect street on its north
side as far as Church street. On the south
side of this street there is widespread ruin
from a short distance west of Main street
to the parsonage of the Second Presbyte

Moreover, a life insurance company can-
not undertake the obligations and opera-
tions peculiar to other Institutions without
using methods and subjecting its business
to contingencies Â¦ which contravene and
imperil the very . structure imposed 1 upon
life-insurance by its own particular pur-
pose. ' â¢ .

to attract business undertakes to treat its
reserves, created and held for, the ulti-

policies seem to be a "bond," comparable
in cost and outcome with a real bond in-
vestment, it not only exposes its whole In-
surance business to the sudden paying out
of the reserves necessary to Its Integrity,
but, If it, regards its premiums as "de-
posits" or as ."installment payments" for
the purchase of '.'bonds," it has to charge
these deposits or installments with ;not
only their annual, contribution to death
losses, but* with commissions to agents
and ' other v expenses, which take out of
them every year a large percentage on
each $100 deposited or paid in, varying ac-
cording to the company* Â£Â» economy or
But because a man's duty to protect his
family is imperative and because he can-
not otherwise rightly and fully discharge
it, he is justified in incurring that ex-
pense for that purpose. , But he is not
justified in incurring that, expense by
using the company to do some other and
different thing which can be done by
some other instrumentality at far less
expense. ' ,
While, then, the service life insurance
renders is unique, its cost, even when
kept rigidly down to a' minimum, is
unique as compared with that of savings
banks or the investment of money In or-
dinary safe wavs. '
Unfortunately the business is and apr
parently can be done only by solicitation,
which is costly; and it demands the em-
ployment of large office . and medical
staffs and field organizations.'
In dealing with life insurance as one of
the, most useful and influential factors
In the development of our socio-economic
life, it is of the highest importance not
enly to recognize at its fullest use and
value its true aim and single function,
but also to recognize the limitations of
lhat function by reason both of the sin-
gleness of the aim itself and by certain
incidents inseparable from the conduct
of the business as a business; which inci-
dents sum up their effect in an expense
of management necessarily higher than
that of any other class of institutions
used for the care and . investment i of
money. ': . .
This is the one thing life insurance can
do; this is the^. one* thing 'which no other
device of man can do. Every other thing
that can be done for men with money,
and with their. money, can be done, and
best done, by other financial schemes and
the institutions designed and fitted to
their specific purposes, but this one thing
none other can do. Therefore must he on
whose life others depend use It for their
immediate and sufficient protection.
The Limitations of Life Insurance.
Life insurance changes all this: It, and
it alone among human schemes, can pro-
vide at once, in case of death, the fund
which could have been accumulated only
in a long lifetime, which might never
have been otherwise accumulated at all,
which at best could have grown but slow-
ly, and might have been stopped at any
time.
For consider: Life insurance contem-
plates and is adjusted to just one endâ
the immediate and sufficient protection of
those dependent ones who are either not
at all or insufficiently provided - for in
case their breadwinner dies, and for
whom he can make no other provision at
once, and can make no other at all ex-
cept by the long- process of yearly sav-
ings slowly accumulated in savings banks
or by investment in safe securities bear-
ing interest at a moderate rate, all sub-
ject to interruption and delay by unfor-
tunate contingencies, and to be brought
to an end at any moment by his death.
The True Aim.
What better can it do? What other or
different thing -ought it to strive for?
What other or different thing can it, or
any other company, undertake with real
success?
. While others strive for, great and rapid
growth/regardless of the great cost and
enormous waste of business that go
with their fierce competition', and would
persuade the public that all who do not
adopt their alms and follow their meth-
ods are deficient in ambition and energy,
your company holds steady to the purpose
of furnishing* the best that life insurance
can do at its very least attainable cost.
It is by resolute adherence to these prin-
ciples and . the maintenance . of these
necessary conditions, against : a competi-
tion inspired by very different views, that
The Connecticut Mutual has come to that

CONNECTICUT
MUTUAL LIFE INSURANCE
COMPANY, '
OF THEâ
FIFTY-SIX rH ANNUAL REPORT
We ask careful scrutiny of the follow-
ing record of the operations of fifty-six
years :
We are maintaining the low cost of busi-
ness; the sales of real estate will jrrad-
ually reduce taxes and expenses and im-
prove the surplus income, and we shrunk
our surplus last year only $180,308.
And our situation respecting the use of
surplus differs materially from that of
most companies in this, that the bulk of
theirs is held under a moral though not a
legal or contract Hen for the deferred divi-
dends hoped for by those who outstay the
next one to twenty years. It i3 not so
with us. It is not held as a speculation
for a few. but for the benefit of the busi-
ness as a whole.
The market value of our securities has
j increased considerably during the year;
and they are of a cnaracter to be least
unfavorably affected by market fluctua-
tions.
Surplus and Dividends.
As the cost of a man's policy In & mn-
, tual insurance company-is the difference
' between the premiums charged and the
amount returned to him by way of a divi-
dend, the surplus earned and the surplus
divided become very important factors in
his experience with his company. Surplus
can be earned legitimately In only three
ways: 1â by smaller expenses than the
premium provides for; 2â by a less mortal-
I ity than is provided for; 3â by a higher
rate of interest than is assumed as prob-
able in computing premiums and reserves.
For many years the competition haa had
a bad effect upon the expense account of
most companies; it has also led to a goou
deal of apparently doubtful experimenta-
tion in the selection of risks and in dealing
with hazards; and the steady decline In
the interest rate has eaten away mucn of
a very important item of possible surplus.
The matter Is of somewhat special In-
terest to us | at this time because the dis-
agreeable task of cutting dividends has
been in recent years and is still being
quite largely performed by some com-
panies; and any reference to their reduced
dividends In comparison with the increas-
ing scale maintained by the Connecticut
Mutual for now twenty-one years is met
by the assertion that this company, too,
must presently cut down its returns; that
the rate of Interest is going down, ami
that its surplus is already diminishing.
We have never undertaken to prophesy.
We do not try to prejudge events. We pre-
fer to meet them, and our duty to you
under them, without pressure or prejudice
from wrong preconceptions, or from hav-
ing put ourselves in a false position. Wh<>n
we can no longer earn the surplus we aro
dividing and can no longer safely trench,
upon the large existing surplus, kept up
for the purpose, to maintain the present
rate of dividend, we shall not hesitate to
say so and to act as the facts may- require.
History of Our Surplus.
We only wish to call the attention of
those In any manner Interested to & few
pertinent facts: . â¢ â¢
For many years this company has been
governed by the idea that, while surplus
should be quite closely divided each year
so as to make a man's payments as small
as possible, yet, as it is impossible that an
absolutely complete division can be made,
and as a gradual If small annual reduction
In payment tends to the persistence of the
business, it is desirable in unusually good
years to accumulate such margins of sur-
plus as may be earned over and above or-
dinary surplus-earning capacity, to bÂ«
used in maintaining the dividend rate in
the years when the margins, may fall be-
low. It greatly helps the premium-payer,
and, the proper adjustment by post-mor-
tem dividend being made, it work3 no in-
equity to any one.
During the decade 1870-80 the company
had occasion to trench very largely on
accumulated surplus In this manner. In
1881 its surplus was $3,351455, which was
6.77 per cent of Its assets. The conditions
being untoward, it was decided to reduce
the dividend scale to the apparent actual
earning capacity. From this point we be-
gan to earn small items of surplus above
the amount annually divided. In 1882 wa
recast the premiums and reserves for all
future business on a basis of 3 instead of
4 per cent interest, which cut down the
margin for expenses and increased the
amount required for reserve. Notwith-
standing. In 1892 the surplus had crept up
to $6,059,136. It was then deemed proper
to liberally revise the scale of division; but
the surplus continued to increase until
1898 when it stood at $7,521,909. Since then,
it has been somewhat drawn upon each,
year to maintain the long-continued scale
of dividend. How long it may be neces-
sary to do this, if It long remains neces-
sary, or how far we may deem, it wlÂ»e and
prudent to continue the process, we can-
not predict. It Is a just and proper as*
well as the intended use of past accumu-
lations of surplus so long as it is safe.
When it approaches the questionable point
we shall stop and frankly go upon a scale
that squares with the facts and conditions
likely to govern the future.
We could spare over $2,500,000 from our
present surplus of $7,011,040, and yet have
as large a percentage to assets remaining
as when we made the last cut in 1881.
saying nothing of over $2,470,000 greater
comparative strength in our reserves by
reason of the 3 per cent Interest assump-
tion. ._ .
The balance or net, profit- of the year
upon changes in ! securities and sale of
real estate was $88,603.75.
The Interest rate on desirable loans and
securities has tended to a still further de-
cline, with a growing scarcity of satis-
factory investments for funds in the na-
ture ' of a trust. We have considerably
reduced loans on real estate and increased

ties.. .-Â¦';' ' - ' ' V '" : :.*.<-Â¦

nearing completion, and is being followed
by changes in and additions to the old,
which will bring the two advantageously
together, with a good prospect of a satis-
factory financial re.sult.
For the seven years prior to 1901 fore-
closures . of mortgages were in consider-
able excess of sales. During the last year,
however, the situation has changed; we
took In properties costing us $217,814.35,
and sold properties that had cost $868,-
379.26. Some of these sold at a profit and
some at less than original cost. Many of
the properties sold -were among our older
holdings In localities where changes of
business centers had permanently depre-
ciated -values. .We still have some prop-
erties In like situation, which will prob-
ably sell for something less than cost,
and it is our purpose to dispose of them
as it can be done without unnecessary
loss, and so Improve Income and reduce
expense. Upon the greater . body of our
holdings, : however, we may reasonably
expect some gain In a fair market. We
have made a good deal of money on the
whole on foreclosed real estate.
ments.
The same careful ecorfomy has been ex-
ercised as in all the past. For the last
two or three years the expenses incident
to the care and repairs upon foreclosed
real estate, which have been charged to
expense account rather than to the prop-
erty account, have carried our expense
ratio temporarily higher than our usual
standard. This difference will disappear
as the property which has caused it is dis-
posed of. The ratio for 1901 was less than
that for 1900.
Heal Estate, Interest and Invest-
Expenses of Management
The volume of risks, their excellent
character, their steady persistence and
the care with which new business is se-
lected to replace the old, all combine to
give a mortality experience very favorable
in rate and very uniform on the average.
Throughout the entire history of the com-
pany its losses have been less than four-
fifths of those expected.
Owing to the age of the company and
the remarkably small proportion of lapses
and surrenders and the consequent per*
sistence of its business, its risks have
come to have a greater average age than
those of any other company; it has also
proportionately larger resources in the
reserves held on the amount at risk. Al-
though from the greater average age the
mortality is necessarily large, it is far less
than was expected and has been provided
for by these greater resources, a corre-
sponding part of which becomes each .year
a saving from the expected losses. This
saving during the past year amounted to
$595,819. . '
Mortality.
The new business written was larger in
amount than in the previous year; the
number of lapses and other terminations
was considerably: smaller; the increase in
the amount of business In force was con-
sequently greater, with a corresponding
increase in premium income and in assets.
In its main results and In the conditions
affecting the future with which it closes,
the year 1901 was a satisfactory one. The
details are given so fully elsewhere that
we shall here deal only with the general
features of the year's experience.
The Operations of the Year.
It is in its business so conceived, so
based and so administered, that your
company has achieved that great
strength, steady prosperity, and that
steady and great volume of operation
that have enabled it to serve its members
to their unique advantage; and it is in
holding to the same sure conditions and
in the full fruition of their consequences,
that it confidently hopes to render a fu-
ture service of equal beneficence to de-
pendent families, and of equal value to
those whose duty it is to protect them.
It is because there Is but just the one
thing that 'life-insurance can do that no
other institution can do, and because, at
best, its necessary cost is relatively high,
and because any* other financial operation
can be better and more cheaply done by
some other -institution organized for its
own specific purpose, and.because a life.
Insurance company cannot do anything
.that other institutions specifically under-
take except at a Sisproportionate and
excessive cost, and yet more, because any
other thing which other Institutions un-
dertake is, in specific aim, method and in-
cident, in conflict with and more or less
destructive of the proper aims, methods
and results of life insurance and its ad-
ministration; it is â¢ because of these
things The Connecticut Mutual has re-
fused to be led aside by the stress of com-
petition, to deck 'out "life insurance In the
garb of something else, has adhered to
the true and particular aim of life in-
surance and its necessary method, . and
has thereby accomplished its intended
result of perfect protection at low cost in
an incomparable degree; it is because of
these things that it still so bases and
frames and administers its contracts as
to give to its beneficiaries sure protection
at least cost and at an annual cost to
the payer of the premiums, according to
his own proper risk from whatever cause,
protecting him against fraud by others
and the cost of It, and not taking any-
thing from him by any device for the
benefit of some one else.
The Sound Position.
. And. yet one of the most striking fea-
tures: of the experience of 'the companies
competing .by .these methods for great
growth for twenty-five years and more is
the fact that, notwithstanding the enor-
mous lapses and forfeitures, which have
occurred -and upon ; which they have de-
pended, for unusual profits to those who
outlived and outstayed the deferred divi-
dend period, tthe . expense has been so
great that the actual dividends have not
even approximated the estimates upon
which the business was secured. J
Lesson, of Experience,
Present Competition,
'Obviously^ one cannot afford to. employ
a.;life insurance company. with its neces-
sarily high expense rate to act as his sav-

ever, phrased,, as real investment bonds,
nor to "have his life Insurance, on which

stant menace of the wholesale withdrawal

they were really mere deposits in bank.

ACCOUNTS of the steam trials of the Russian cruiser Novlk on July, 13 of
last year have only recently been published in the Marine Rundschau, and
it Is to be regretted that they lack the completeness which the trial of
such a remarkable vessel warranted. The vessel was tried in the Baltic
under favorable conditions, making her runs between a lighthouse and a
lightship, an "air line distance of fifty miles. The apparent speed on the outward
trip was found to be 25.03 knots, which was corrected to a little
over 26 knots, owing "to wild steering and the home run was
figufed out to be 25.4 knots, an. allowance of two knots being made for
' the Irregular course taken. The runs occupied 3 hours 43 minutes and 33 seconds,
and the average for the six hours' trial was between 17,500 and 15,000 horsepower,
with 172 revolutions. The air pressure in the stoke hold was 2.16 Inches and the
coal consumption 1.96 pounds per unit of horsepower. The ship was tried under
service conditions, fully completed and with 3C0 tons of coal on board. The Novik
was built by Schicliau at Elblng, and is 317 feet 10 Inches In length, 40 feet breadth
and 16 fe^t 4 inches draught. The battery consists of six 4.7-inch, one 2.5-lnch, six
1.85-inch, two 1.46-inch rapid-firing guns and five torpedo tubes. The contract stip
ulated 17,000 horsepower and minimum speed of 23 knots, which appears to have

Senator Penrose has Introduced a bill in the United States Senate providing
for the construction of a torpedo cruiser to steam at least forty knots an hour and
to cost $500,000. It is undoubtedly the scheme of some Irresponsible and visionary
Inventorâ one of a class that bother the Navy Department with impracticable pro
jectsâand-Is unlikely to receive serious attention. Our recent experience In tor
pedo-boat building has been unsatisfactory to the Government and ruinous to
contractors. A report just made public by the bureau of construction summarizes
, the status of the destroyers and torpedo-boats, and finds that of the sixteen de
stroyers none will be entirely satisfactory and that nine torpedo-boats out of
twelve will be failures. The exceptions In the latter class are three boats built by
the Bath Iron Works, which firm adopted a successful French . design and em
ployed skilled and experienced persons. Sympathy is extended in the report to
ward the contractors who, without knowledge of the difficulty, rushed in for the
. work of building these boats and have paid dearly for their temerity. Three firms
have been financially embarrassed and all have lost money on their contracts. Sev
eral boats are. still uncompleted and are likely to remain so until the Government
takes the boats off the hands of the builders, and bills for relief and alterations.
, amounting to over $5,000,CO0, will be presented to Congress, making the total cost
of our new torpedo fleet somewhere about $12,000,000, instead of $6,900,000. as orig
inally estimated. The worst feature about the business is that the boats will be
practically useless. In that they are of flimsy- construction and their contract
speeds, varying from thirty to twenty-four knots, will be reduced to twenty and
twenty-five knots.

Conditions in California have changed considerably
during the past week. It was only a few days ago
that the specter of a possible dry year began to ap
pear on the horizon, but the rains have come and the
sinister shade has vanished. The central and northern
parts of the State have received several rai<s, more or
less copious, almost sufficient to insure the crops,
but the San Joaquin can stand a good deal more
moisture and the southern part of the State needs a
good deal more yet. Even as it is the outlook is
certainly much brighter than a week agb, and there
is a. feeling of cheerfulness in all lines of business,
both here and in the country. It is the consensus of
opinion among business men who handle farm pro
duce that, while we may not this year obtain the
phenomenal prices of 1901 for many lines of produce,
still we will receive as good returns as the average]
and probably better than during some previous years]
owing to the short supplies of food staples all over
the country. Hence the outlook may be classed as
especially fine.

The other feature of the week was a sudden famine

give any reason for this, and it may be due to the
continued sharp demand for iron and steel products,
which continues without a break. Finished steel

THE BUSINESS SITUATION.
The question of adopting the system has been long
under consideration both in this country and in
Great Britain, but comparatively: little progress has
been attained. The scientists and the exporters of
both countries have favored the reform, but the con
servatism of the people ,has prevented its adoption.
It seems, however, that the eventual adoptionof the
system is 'inevitable. Just as the Russians continue
to hold aloof from the calendar that obtains else
where throughout the civilized world, so we may for
a time continue to stand aside from the prevailing
system of weights and measures. With the increase
of our foreign commerce, however, there will come
an increased' need for the change.- When it is'reso
lutely^ attempted it will probably be found that its
adoption causes much less trouble than has been
feared. The Americans are a quick-witted people and
being familiar with the decimal system through the
use of it in money, it would not take us long to ap
ply it in weights and measures :'"
It is in relation to foreign trade that the larger
benefits would be obtained. The metric system pre
vails 1 now almost uniformly throughout Continental
Europe and Latin America. It has become, as it were,
an international standard, and manufacturers who
make their goods in conformity with its measure
ments have a big advantage in the' worlds markets
over those who do not. Not long ago a B|jtish com
mission appointed to inquire into the decline in the
demand on the Continent for British manufactures of
iron and steel reported that much of the decline was
due to the fact that the goods were not adapted to
French and German measurements.
In^decidipg upon the question the people will have
to consider the difficulty and the cost of adopting the
new system, as well as the advantages which would
flow from it. The. advantages would certainly be
great. By the simplicity of calculations under the
metric system every merchant and manufacturer
would gain much. Bookkeeping and accounting
would be easier and speedier,, especially in the case
of accounts involving fractions. There would be less
liability to mistake and less trouble over petty tran
sactions.
Were the question the simple one of choosing be
tween the metric system, with its decimal .method of
calculation, and the systemâ or rather the lack, of
systemâ of weights and measures now in vogue in
this country and in Great Britain, there w<5uld be no
hesitation in making the choice. We know the ad
vantages of a decimal system of currency, and cart
readily perceive that equal if not greater advantages
would follow the adoption of a like system in all
kinds of trade measurements. The. question, how
ever, is not presented , in that simple^way. A change
to the metric systeni "would require the whole people
to educate themselves anew with respect to weights,
measures and values. Furthermore, all the measur
ing implements and appliances now in use would
have to be discarded, and the consequent loss would
be considerable.
HAVING obtained opinions from the scientists
of the country upon' the advisability of adopt*!
ing the metric system â¢ of weights and meas
ures, the House Committee of Ways and Means is
now engaged in hearing merchants and manufac
turers. At a recent session of the committee some of
the leading business men of the East were heard, and
reports of the proceedings say the sentiment was en
tirely favorable to the proposed change.

RUSSIA'S NEW, CRUISER NOVIK.
IS A REMARKABLY FAST WARSHIP
WHEN the postman delivers the mall at the residence of Mr. and Mrs.
Clement Moore, Euclid avenue, Hackensack, N. J., he is greeted with
a shrill, clear army call from a caged bird. The strain, whistled
through without a break, was long ago identified by military residents
in the community as the "adjutant's call."
The newspaper carrier receives the same salute, also the master of the
house. Desultory visitors pass unnoticed."
When Jack, the bird, is in good humor he will obey the signal of master
and mistress and will whistle the refrain through for the edification of com
pany. When particularly interested in his audience he will add to his repertoire
the clearly denned "assembly call" and conclude with the "stable call." When
in a sulky humor visitors receive but scanty attention in the rendition of the
"stable call" only. *- .
Jack is probably the oldest "troopial" bird in captivity, and is thought to be
the only one of the kind in the United States. He was purchased by Moore al
most fourteen years ago, and was thought to be several years old at that time.
The bird had been In the possession of an army officer and its only home had
been at cavalry posts.
Jack's attention Is distracted only when his master annoys him by wearing
glasses or his mistress displays a brilliant brooch. He will stop In the middle
of the most satisfactory performance the instant any brilliant object meets his
eye and will dart at it directly./" The brilliancy of a woman's eyes so attracted
him once that he flew at them 'before any one could interpose and gave the fair
visitor a sharp nip on .the eyelid.
In appearance Jack closely resembles the Baltimore oriole, or golden robin,
which is peculiar to the Ameriaan continent. He has the same rich orange and
black plumage and the same sweetness of song. He is also of similar size.
But Jack's birthplace was South America and his chatter and many antics sug
gest the magpie.
The term "troopial," .which designates the class to which Jack belongs, is
due from the habit of birds of this kind to associate in large troops. They
move in flocks and show great partiality to the neighborhood of man. They
are equally at home on the ground or in the trees and are loquacious at all
times. They learn both to whistle and to articulate words.
- Moore is also the possessor of a talking mlna bird from Manila. This mina
Is enow whiteâ an unusual color. It can cry like a child, say "mamma," also
"come back" and "come here." It can call repeatedly "unwa, unwa," a term
that some scholar has interpreted for Moore as Hindostanee for "nurse."

ago to a prospective' revival of Dickens.
Of course, never since the great novelist

he died, have his works ceased to be sold)
in some shape or fashion. But by revival
is meant a sudden demand for his works.
For a long time Dickens was considered
by the fashionable set to be a novelist of
the people pure and simple. He was
considered vulgar, while Thackeray was
looked upon as the novelist of educated
minds. Now all this is changed. Thacke
ray is out of it for the time being.

'h Most of the present Board of Supervisors were re
elected^to office because they had in their former
official term put a. stop to track gambling in this city
Their re-election was a vote of confidence that they
would stand steadfast against the gamblers. If they
fail now. the people will demand to know the reason
why .
The Supervisors are bound to -guard the welfare
of the city, to assist the police in suppressing crime
and nvpreventing this city from becoming the resort
of criminals. It would be folly for them to adopt an
ordinance which would attract blacklegs to the city
and then employ an- increased police force to watch
them. With what show of candor can a Supervisor
declare himself in favor of suppressing crime if he
vote to legalize that which invariably produces crime?
San Francisco knows by dire experience what
comes from track gambling and the enticements of
trick gamblers. 'We do not wish to renew- the sor
rows of those families, who have already suffered
too much from track gambling, by republishing the
names of men and women who have been led to dis
honor, disgrace, ruin, crime and suicide: by the gam
bling that was once permitted at Ingleside, but the Su
pervisors can easily recall most of them. In fact, it is
to be doubted if there is a single member of the board
who has not had some friend or some acquaintance
at least ruined by racetrack gambling. There are the
records of the criminal courts, the prisons and the
Morgue to show what legalized gambling leads to.
By reason of these characteristics of racetrack gam
bling its toleration draws to the community sharpers,
fakers, blacklegs and confidence men from far and
wide. These fellows are a corrupting force that soon
makes its influence felt. They make acquaintances
easily, they are genial, they are free with their coin.
They entice the youth of the city to drink and to gam
ble, and they start on a downward career many a
young man who if free from their enticements would
have lived an honored life and been of value to his
family and to his city. . ' A
It is to be noted, moreover, that no gambler will
pay $120 a day for the privilege of running a gam
bling game of any kind unless the game gives him a
big percentage of chances against the outside bettor.
How large is the percentage in favor of the bookma
ker we have no means of calculating, but from the
amount of money the bookmakers are willing to pay
for the privilege it is safe to assume the percentage
must be very high indeed â higher, in fact, than the
percentage in favor of the banker at faro, the dealer
at roulette or the proprietor of a poker parlor.
Track gambling, then, is not only profitable; but;
crooked. -The men who are enticed to engage; infif?
have harflly,. any chance for their money. They "-may
win now^ and "then, Ijut in the. end they lose. 7. Thus;
the. bettor of small means is soon brought to>rfie
end of his purse, 'and he has then either to accept
the loss as final, or resort to embezzlement, theft,
forgery or robbery to obtain money to continue the
game.
The full extent of the revenues' that will flow into
the pockets of those having the privilege of legal
gambling in San Francisco cannot be accurately esti
mated even by gamblers themselves. It is known,
however, that the men who last held that right
were able to sell bookmaking privileges on their
track for $120 a day to as many as eighteen book
makers. Here was an income of $2160 a day from
that single source. It is clear the bookmakers would
not pay so large a sum for the privilege of gambling
unless they were assured of making a profit. How
large those profits were no man can say, but it is
certain they .were considerable, and when added to
the profits made by the managers who sold them the
privilege the aggregate amount of the income from
gambling must have been enormous as compared
with the profits of any productive industry.
When racetrack gambling was prohibited in San
Francisco, and the people, after a prolonged 1 fight
against the gamblers, were rejoicing in their victory,
The Call gave warning that it would not be long
before an attempt would be made to revive the prac
tice. The profits of legalized gambling are so large
and the risks so slight that those who fatten upon
the vices 'of society are ever on the alert to obtain
a gambling privilege. Any State in'the Union could
obtain an immense sum for a lottery franchise. Any
large city could derive a vast revenue for a privilege
of establishing a legal gambling place like that at
Monte Carlo. Public sentiment will not permit such
privileges to ( be granted. The racetrack then remains
the last resort of the predatory gamblers in this coun
try. Wherever there is a chance for them to get
that privilege of conducting their gambling games
under a - legal sanction they are eager and insistent.
Defeated at one point they will attack another, an4
Â¦when one set fails completely another set springs up
and repews the struggle. Â»
, The issue is not one of horse racing, nor of any
question affecting the promotion of horse breeding
in California. . Neither is-it a question of authoriz
ing an enterprise of productive industry that would
tend to increase the business and the wealth of the
city. It is a plain question of legalizing gambling.
That which the resolution purposes to do is nothing
more nor less than to permit certain forms of gam
bling to be carried on at Ingleside racetrack, and to
give to the managers of the track the privilege of
controlling the gambling operations and of making a
profit out of them.
WHEN the Supervisors of San Francisco deal
to-day with the Ingleside resolution they
should do so with' a clear ; understanding
of what it means and with a full sense of their official
responsibility to the community â¢â¢ '

British colonies increased from $133,000,000 in 1885*
to $288,000,000 in 1899. Other statistics showing the I
development of colonial civilization are that the num
ber of postoffices in- India increased from 753 in 1856
to 29,122 in 1889; that the telegraph lines in the Brit
ish colonies' generally increased from 115,000 miles in '
1889- to over. 150,000 miles in 1899; that colonial tele
phone lines aggregate more than 50,000 miles, and
that in India the sums expended for public instruc
tion increased from 394,000 rupees in 1858 to more
than 36,000,000 rupees in 1899.
The figures of course show only the brighter and
better side of colonial administration. Their cost
has been great in .blood and in treasure, and the
whole burden has not been borne by the white
man. A gloomy picture could be presented of what
the civilizing process in India has cost both to that \
country and to Great Britain. Other colonizing em
pires have had an experience even worse than that;
of the British, and were the cost to be taken into con
sideration throughout the whole range ,of colonial
government it would probably be found that the good
obtained is / hardly worth the expenditure required.
Moreover, it might possibly have been gained at a
less cost by other methods than by that pursued by
the colonizing empires. "...
The commercial showing of the results of colonial
administration is .equallyigood. It is stated that : the
commerce of the British colonies alone has grown
from over $300,000,000 in 1850 to $2,400,000,000 in
1900. The British colonies were able to import $1,150,
000,000 worth of food, clothing and the comforts of
civilized life from other parts of the world in 1899,
against $140,000,000 worth in 1850; the French colo
nies, $160,000,000 worth in 1899, against $91,000,000
worth in 1887â an increase of 72.5 per cent in twelve
years: ; ' . .. Â¦ Â¦ 'â¢;'Â¦- . - .'-Â¦.Â¦Â¦Â¦: ,\ ,Â¦''

AMUSEMENTS.VIGII.ANT "WATCHMAN
PREVENTS A ROBBERY
Shots Are Exchanged in a Pennsyl-
vania Town and Bandits Are
1 â¢Â¦-â¢ rv~' : Routed.
LANCASTER, Pa., Feb. 9.â An attempt
was made yesterday to rob the Gap
National Bank, at Gap, Pa., sixteen miles
east of this city, ending in a lively ex
change of shots between the town's
watchman, David Stamlx, and the bur
glars, i
Stamix heard an explosion at the bank
and found three or four men standing in
front of the building. They ordered him
to hold up his hands. Stamix opened fire
on the burglars, wounding at least one.
as there were blood marks where they
had been standing. The robbers returned
the fire, Stamix backing' away toward the
home of the cashier, with the view of get
ting assistance. When the shooting began
two or three other men ran out of the
bank building and joining their comrades
disappeared in the darkness.
An examination disclosed the fact that
the men had attempted to blow the vault
open with dynamite or nitro-glycerln, but
without success. Early this morning a
stranger stopped at Glen, a few miles east
of Gap, and had a wound in his jaw
dressed. He was subsequently arrested at
Parkersburg. '
All indications point to the fact that the
leader of the- band is Jack Musgrave, who
was hunted" out of the Territory/several
months ago and for whose capture, dead
or alive, a large reward is offered by
Wells-Fargo and the Territorial authori
ties.
Musgrave's band, said to number fif
teen men, including the leader, struck
across Southern New Mexico more than a
week ago, heading toward the. wildest and
most unfrequented mountain region of the
Territory. At Fort Sumner a store was
robbed and a Mexican was murdered. At
the Black ranch, fifteen miles distant
from Capitan,. the corral was raided and
the ranchmen held up, while the robbers
exchanged their jaded horses for fresh
mounts. The robbers then escaped toward
the mountains, but robbed several stores
and ranches before reaching the foothills.
The Sheriffs of the two counties, with
large posses, pursued them into the moun
tains.
EL , PASO, Tex., Feb. 9.â James Witt,
City Marshal of. Santa Rosa, N. M., ar
rived here to-day with the report that
Sheriffs' posses from two counties over
took eight members of the Jack Musgrave
gang- in the Capitan Mountains and a fight
ensued. The officers crept up on the out
laws' camp and fired from cover, killing
or wounding four of the gang. The others
reached their horses . and escaped. The
reports of the fight brought here by the
officer were quite meager, and it will
probably be several days before the full
details are known.

Dr. Mueller, formerly Consul of the
Orange Fiee State to Holland, says the
correspondent of the Daily Telegraph at
The Hague has suddenly started for New
York. He is understood to be on a mis
sion for the Boer delegates.
Lord Kitchener's great plan, which he
has been elaborating for months past,
failed by the escape of Dewet, but was
successful in the greatest single capture
of Boers since Lord Kitchener arrived in
South Africa. Altogether twenty-two
columns were employed in an immense
circular parallelogram, formed by the
lines of blockhouses and the railroads be
tween Wolvehol, Frankfort, LIndlcy and
Kroonstad^ It is estimated that Dewet's
forces amounted, roughly speaking, to
2000 men. Lord Kitchener personally su
perintended the final preparations for the
expedition, and the great move was made
in a frontier of forty miles, the advance
extending sixty miles,' with the object of
driving the Boers against the railroad
line, where armored trains were patrolling
and were repeatedly in action shelling the
Boers to prevent their crossing the rail
road. Dewet succeeded in slipping
through the lines to the southward. The
whereabouts of Mr. Steyn is unknown,
though one report says he is with Dewet.
"I did not get exact details of the Boer
casualties." continues Lord Kitchener,
"but as far as I have ascertained they
consist oii 283 in killed, wounded and
prisoners, as well as about 700 tired
horses and many cattle. Our casualties
were only ten."
Many attempts, were made to break
through the line on the night of Febru
ary 7. reports Lord Kitchener, the line of
outposts being attacked at various places
throughout the night, but very few es
caped and ten dead Boers were picked up
in the morning near Hellbron.
The advance was continued on Febru
ary 6 and Dewet was within its inclos
ure, but, realizing his position, he ordered
his men to disperse and seek safety dur
ing the night. Dewet himself, with some
men and a number of cattle, made for
the Kroonstadt-Lindley blockhouse line,
and at 1 o'clock in the morning, when It
was very dark, by rushing his cattle at
the fence, broke his way though the line,
mixed up with the cattle and losing three
men killed.
LONDON, Feb. 10.â From Wolvehoek
Lord Kitchener to-day telegraphed a long
description of a combined movement of
numerous British columns, with the ob
ject of capturing General Dewet.
Lord Kitchener says the advance be
gan on the night of February 4, the whole
force moving from various directions and
forming a continuous line of mounted
men on the west bank of the Llebenberg
Vlei, from Frankfort as far south as
Fannys Home, and thence to Kafflrkof.
The line then advanced to the west and
the following night the British in
trenched with their outposts fifty yards
apart. They held the line from Holland,
on the Heilbron-Frankfort blockhouse
line, to Doornkloof on the Kroonstactt-
Lindley blockhouse line, while the col
umns were also working in advance of
the blockhouse lines to prevent Dewefs
crossing.

Signals of distress sent up "were an
swered by the crews at Devils Island and
Herring Cove, the latter crew arriving
first and taking oft* Blair. The life-saving
crews are alongside the steamer in readi
ness to take off the captain and crew in
case occasion arises. .
The weather cleared so much after the
Grecian struck that It was seen that the
shore was only thirty yards distant, but
the shore Is one of the most dangerous
spots along the western shore, a great cilff
of rock overhanging the beach. On top
of the cliff, but inland somewhat, the mili
tary authorities. are constructing an Im
mense fort to be known as "Splon Kop."
The steamer lies broadside to the beach
with a list to port. There is seventeen
feet of water In the fore hold and twelve
feet in the after hold. The engine room,
which is protected by water-tight com
partments, is still dry and steam is being
kept up. Lighters and tugs were sent
from this city with divers and wrecking
gear during the day, and by. 6 o'clock over
100 tons of the cargo had been lightered.
HALIFAX, N. S., Feb. 9.-The Allan
line steamer Grecian, Captain Harrison,
from St. Johns.' N. F.,- ran on the rocks
on the western shore five miles from this
city at 3 o'clock this morning and now has
water in fore and after . holds, j with the
engine room free. Her position, however,
Is a very bad one. She had on board one
passenger, Mr. John- Blair of St. Johns,
who has been landed, and 300 tons of
cargo, part of which has been taken out.
The Grecian left Liverpool on January
25, and after a stormy passage reached
St. Johns, discharging there a quantity o*
cargo. - She loft St. Jonns on Thursday
evening, and flne weather was experience
all the way. Off Chebucto Head,. at 2:iW
o'clock this morning, Pilot William- F.
Fleming boarded her. The weather was
then clear and the harbor lights were visi
ble.. The steamer, proceeded at ordinary
speed until a thick snow squall set in. A
little later the engines were stopped and
soundings taken. The water was very
deep and the steamer was started ahead
again until the lookout shouted, "Land
ahead!" The engines were then reversed
,and the steamer sent full speed astern.
After going about ninety yards the Gre
cian crashed against a rock known as the
"Holy Stone," a hole being torn in her
stern. She rebounded forward and went
on other rocks, which ripped up several
bottom plates, where she held fast. There
is no wind and the sea is calm. The steam
er made water Â¦ so fast that the boats*
were quickly swung from the davits.
The President and Mrs. Roosevelt, to
gether with Secretary Cortelyou, are be
ing entertained at the house of William
Amery Gardner, brother-in-law of Mrs.
John L. Gardner of Boston, a very
wealthy man, but nevertheless one of the
instructors In the school.
Mrs. Roosevelt was at the window of
the sick room as the President drove past
into the school yard, and greeted him as
he mounted the stairs. The two immedi
ately went to the sick boy.'s room and the
President was delighted to find that his
son's head was very clear and that he
was overjoyed to see his father.
President Roosevelt arrived here at 3:10
this afternoon. He came on the private
car Rambler, arriving in Jersey City soon
after -7' a. m.' The car was immediately
transferred by boat across to Harlem and
left Mott Haven as a special train at
8:20 a. m. A stop was made at New
Haven, where a dispatch was handed to
the President stating that the boy's con
dition was encouraging. No other ! stops
were made until Providence was reached,
where there was a slight delay on ac
count of an accident to the engine. The
train pulled into South station in Boston
at 12:45 p. m., but was immediately hauled
out and around the city through Cam
bridge to the Grand Junction station of
the Boston and Maine Railroad. The run
from Boston to Ayer Junction was made,
in a little over forty minutes, and there
the car was transferred to the Worcester,
Nashua and Rochester division of this
road, the train arriving in Groton at 2:30.
The President's stay here is indefinite,
although it Is ndt believed it will be pro
longed much after Wednesday , unless the
boy's condition takes a change for the
worse.
GROTON. Mass., Feb. 9.â President
Roosevelt upon his. arrival at the Groton
school this afternoon did not find his son,
Theodore Jr., alarmingly ill with pneu
monia, but the boy's condition was not
Â¦sufficiently j reassuring to warrant ; the
President's immediate return to the na
tional capital. To-night it was stated that
the boy's condition is unchanged and he
is holding his own well. The school has
been dismissed and the 150 boys have been
scattered to their homes upon an en
forced vacation.

Diseases are blotches on the fair page of life.
A verj' -large share of diseases can be traced to
the' stomach being., "out of sorts.V '"Nine-
tenths of 1 all .diseases."; said Abernathy. the
great English physician, '.'come from the stom-
ach.'.V- r>r. I Fotherglll, another. English physi-
cian of .world-wide repute, once declared: ""Of
every ten ' men you meet Â¦ on Â¦ the street, sevtn
have " stomach :, trouble of some kind." There
are : many ; cases * of ill health of which imper-
fect digestion Is the unsuspected cause. Olttn
there are i none of the - more : prominent symp-
toms of dyspepsia such Â»s distress after eat-
ing.' heartburn, , waterbrash, : t>elchlng - of " gaa,
etc., h but .there are other symptoms , that m.iy
be really due to ' dyspepsia' but are not | usually
attributed toMt by the sufferer,, among "which
- Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets cure all "kinds of
dyspepsia, Â¦ therefore they bring relief from all
the varied Â¦ symptoms that are . rr.anif estatio'is
of dyspepsia. To try them is to be convince!
of their merits. They can be bought at any
drug store for fifty cents a box.
Phil Brooks, Detroit. -Mien., says: "Tour
dyspepsia cure has worked wonders In my case.
I suffered for years from dyspepsia but . am
now: entirely, cured and enjoy life as I 'never
have before. I gladly re-commend them."
: Mrs. E. M. Faith" of Byrds Creek. "Wis., says:
"I have taken' all thÂ« Tablets I got of you
and they have done their work well in my case,
for I feel like a different person altogether. I
don't doubt if I had not got them I should
have baen at. rest by this time."
"Mr. E..H.' Davis of Hampton, -Va.. says: "I
doctored five years for dy3pep3ia, but In two
months. I got more benefit from Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets than ; in fire years of the doc-
tors' Â¦ treatment." --... Â¦ â¢ Â¦-, Â¦..
Mr. Thomas Seale, Mayfleld. Calif., says:
"Have used and recommended Stuart's Tablets
because there Is nothing like them to keep the
stomach right."
may be mentioned general nervousness and de-
pression, tired, run-down, played-out, "out cf
sorts" feelings that can not be accounted . for;
headaches; oppression about the heart; bad
complexion, pimples, ' blotches, -. bolls; dizzy
spells; specks .before 'the eyes. etc. Let the
sufferer take Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets ani
these symptoms all disappear, showing plainly
that they were due to the stomach being "out
of sorts." . Â» â¢
When ( the printer is "out of sorts'' the proof
appears ' "dirty" or imperfect. "'

George Kelly, who claims to be an ac

6 o'clock yesterday morning: and booked
for drunkenness. He gave the name of
Thomas F. Galley. He was released
shortly after 8 o'clock on $5 cash ball and
went to tho City Hall station to get an
order for the return of his property. He
was so obstreperous in his demand that
he was again locked up for drunkenness.
This t'me he .gave his name as Thomas F.
Kelly and his occupation as a plumber.
Kelly was taken, from the City Hall
station along with four other prisoners
in the patrol wagon to the City Prison.
As they entered the central police station
Kelly made a break for liberty. He
rushed along the assembly room, along
the basement and up the stairs to the
first floor, so as to make his exit by tho
main entrance from Kearny street. Ser
geant Moffltt and several officers had
started In pursuit, and just as Kelly
neared the street he was overtaken. Ha
struggled to get free, but found it useless,
and was soon In a cell In the prison.

Eeavy Blast Â¦ Jars the Fissure of
Overhanging Walls and the
Timbers Give Way.
BUTTE, Mont., Feb. 9.â In a cave-in in
the' Diamond mine, one of the Amalga
mated properties, two men, Jerry J. Con
roy and Richard Williams, were crushed
to death early this morning.
Without a sign of warning an immense
mass of rock weighing over seventy-five
tons fell upon the men. burying them
completely. Many responded to the call
of rescue, but the mass covering them
was of such proportions that it took five
hours to reach the two men. The bodies
were badly mangled.
It is believed that a previous blast had
jarred the â¢ fissure of the overhanging
walls and that the weight of the rock
was more than the timbers could stand.

The, old "Palace Hotel" on Jackson
street was also raided about S o'clock yes
terday morning and seventeen Chinese
were arrested for violating the ordinance.
The place is run by Moore, ostensibly as
the headquarters of a religious body, tho
Union Â¦ Mission Army, but in reality as
a cheap lodging-house, the charge being
10 cents*- for a 'meal, bed or bath. Moore"
has been a conspicuous figure on the
streets for some years, as he wears tha
uniform of ,a general of the regular army,
and his wife Is attired in a similar uni
form. He has been in trouble here on
more than one occasion, and once he was
arrested for biting a physician on the
arm during a dispute over an account for
medical attendance.

In the second class Beyfuss' victory
over Judah was a surprise, as the latter
was expected to win handily. Beyfuss
alter losing the first set settled down to
steady play and took the next three sets
easily. The score was 5â7, 6â1, 7â5, 6â0.
The handicap of "fifteen" between the
classes was too small. This was by far
the most successful tournament ever held
on the public courts.
Many cracks were out on the California
Club courts yesterday and some good
matches were played. The best match of
the day was between W. B. Collier and
H. -W. Crowell. â¢ After winning. two sets
each the contestants stopped with the
score 8â8 in the,' fifth set.
The match between the two first class
men, Routh and Dunlap, was by far the
best of the tournament. Dunlap relied on
his chop stroke entirely, while Routh used
his speedy drive throughout the match.
The score, in favor of Routh, was 7â5,
5-7, 6â3, 6â3.
Considering the scant odds allowed him
Beyfuss made a remarkably good showing
against Routh. Allowing odds of "fif
teen" Routh won, 7 â 5, 3 â 6, 6â 3, 6 â 0. The
loser is probably the smallest player in
the city, but is quite clever with the
racket.
Charles Dunlap, the park tennis cham
pion, met defeat yesterday at the hands
of Harry Routh on the park courts! On
two previous, occasions the former won
from his opponent by a small margin, but
Routh was invincible yesterday and won
three sets out of four. Routh not'only
won" his class, but came out victorious in
the interclass play-off.
In the second class., Alec Beyfuss beat
Judah three sets out of four and thereby
earned the right to play in the finals with
Routh, the winner of the first class, i .

The loser was a 2 to 1 favorite. During
the stake he ran 187 seconds to his oppo
nent's 13S. The Fox started some four
pounds over his coursing weight on Sat
turday and seemed to run himself into
condition.
The hare when liberated made direct
for the "escape" on the north side of the
field near the kennels and took the two
fast dogs nearly to the fence. Flying Fox
was the first to show in the lead, but was
passed when near the hare by Sacramento
Â±*oy. The hare when hard pressed broke
back toward Flying Fox, giving him the
first turn. He secured a second one al
most immediately. His * opponent then
"tripped" the hare and Flying Fox
dashed in for the kill, which gave him
first place and his owner the long end of
the purse, Sacramento Boy was allowed
one point for speed and one for the
"trip." Flying Fox secured two points
for his two turns and one for the kill.
The fortunes of coursing were not with
Sacramento Boy yesterday at Union Park.
He was defeated in the deciding course
by A. R. Curtis' game greyhound Flying
Fox by the close score of 3 to 2.

On Wednesday "Young Mitchell" and
Kirk Harris will cross the bay with a
party of Olympians to see their young
friend perform. On the night he meets
Toby Irwin at Oakland a. number of his
club friends will be seated together near
the ringside. Britt will try to induce
"Young Mitchell" to act as his second.
In his work yesterday he showed his
strength. He broke the punching bag
from its swivel and sent it flying through
a window. He also showed to advantage
while roughing it with Curtis Richardson.
George Lavigne wanted Britt - to share
his quarters at Blanken's, but he decided
to remain at Alameda.
Britt entertained many friends yester
day, including "Billy" Leonard, De Witt
Van Court, "Charley" Reno, Sam Berger,
Johnny Ferris of the Assessor's office,
Charles Mangels and "Billy" Pratt. In
the morning he did his road work and in
the afternoon exercised in the big gym
nasium at Croll's Gardens. He is delight
ed with his surroundings and with the
consideration shown him. He is not box
ing much, as he wants to take no chance
of injuring his hands.
His mentor would never permit it, say
ing: "Save -that energy for- the. .ring."
The Australians say a race is "left on
the sands" when a horse or a man is
given too severe trials before a contest.
This is what the clever Olympian must
guard against.
When Peter Jackson was. laying the
foundation for his splendid physique, in
Australia, he did his running work on a
quarter-mile cinder path under the watch
ful eyes of his trainer. When the latter
would tell him he had gone far enough
for one spin he would often beg to be al
lowed to test his epeed against the watch.
OVER at*Alameda there Is a light
hearted boy preparing himself for
his first appearance as a profes
. sional boxer. This . is James
Britt. who, for several years, has
'defended the winged "O" of the Olympic
Athletic .Club in championship tourna
ments, and who is matched to box Toby
Ir win before the Acme Club.
The regular exercise, both out of doors
and in the gymnasium, has worked;won
ders in his general health. He goes about
his allotted tasks with all the vim and
enthusiasm of youth. When they <have
been performed he wants to go through
the card again. Herein lies the danger
of overwork into Â¦which amateurs in all
branches of sport are inclined to rush. -
As De Witt Van Court is one of the
lightweight champion's advisers it is not
likely he will make a mistake in this
respect. Â¦ Years ago an amateur boxer
sought Van Court's advice as to training
for a prospective fight. He . was told to
go away to the country and Â¦ spend the
week before the fight out of doors. He
was a hard working blacksmith by trade
and a clever boxer. Van Court knew he
would be improved by the comparative
rest and would take on a little weight,
which he needed. His toil-hardened mus
cles required no additional work. ('
The advice was so different to what he
had expected that he did not" follow It,
but placed himself in the hands of men
who were accustomed to handling pro
fessionals. They gave him the work he
expected and made him exercise until he
was ready to drop from exhaustion. When
the night of the fight came around they
had completely exhausted his vitality,'
that intangible -quality the possession of
which invariably means victory. \ . The
man was easily defeated. Van Court will
always Relieve a promising boxer was
spoiled by lack of intelligent training.

which will be one of the grandest given
in America, will begin promptly at S
o'clock and will last until close to 1
o'clock. It is expected that the Prince
will enter shortly after 8 o'clock. He and
his suite will occupy the five parterre
boxes, which will be especially arranged
for the royal party.
"No pains or expense will be spared to
make the performance a gorgeous one.
The expense will be enormous. Between
$10,000 and $20,000 will be spent upon the
decorations. Specifications for the decor
ations have been sent to the decorators
and the matter will be fully decided upon
in a short time."
In this programme each of the prima

NEW YORK, Feb. 9.â Maurice Grau,
director of the Metropolitan Opera Com
pany, after a conference with the opera
committee of the Mayor's committee ap
pointed in connection with the proposed
visit of Prince Henry, to-day announced
the arrangements, as far as completed,
for the entertainment of the Prince at
the Metropolitan Opera-house on Lha
evening of February 25. The programme
probably will consist of the first act of
"Lohengrin," the second act > of "Car
men," the third act of "Alda," the second
act of "Tannhauser," the first act of "La
Traviata" and the third scene of "El
Cid."
The first of the two extra recitals to' be
Eiven by Josef Hofmann at Metropolitan
Hall will take place next Wednesday
evening, commencing at S:15. The young
virtuoso will play an especially fine list
of numbers, and in the 'Chopin concerto
â¢v ill be. accompanied, on a second piano
by hie father. The: second recital will
take place next Saturday afternoon.
Seats for both recitals arc now on sale
Et Sherman, CJay & Co.'s. The Wednes
cay night recital will give many an op
portunity to- hear the great pianist who
are unable to attend the matinees
The - second symphony concert cf the
seccn-J series of three will takÂ«Â» place
next Friday afternoon at 3:15 sharp at
thÂ» Grand Opera-house. The sale of seats
has eo far been very encouraging and
the steady progress and high achievement
cf thÂ«; orchestra under Paul Steindorffs
Â¦ direction warrant the directors of the so
ciety in believing that a financial suc
cess will be added to the strong artistic
success that has been already achieved
by the San Francisco Symphony Society
The single seat sale will open to-morrow
morning at Sherman & Clay's mu-=ic
store- The programme arranged for the
Friday afternoon concert is as follows:
"T'nflrlshed Symphony" Schubert
Overture. "Th* Life of the Czar" Glinka
"Â§I rerB<5e ." â¢ â¢ - Jadassohn
â¢Phaeton 'eymphonie r-oem) Salnt-Saens
The great St. Leons, acrobats of note
made a hit at the Chutes yesterday with
iheir rrarvelous feats of strength and
agility. Ella Burl's wonderful feat of
crastlnff the chutes en a bicycle is still a
greet attraction, and the other numbers
on th* programme are very entertaining.
The Central Theater has for this week
a strong melodrama, "A Young Wife "
As always with the Central plays "A
Younj; Wife" has sensational interest
and f. story in which the pathetic and
comic elements are blended with happy
effect. The cast includes the best players
in tho. company. Several specialties will
be introduced during the evening.
â¢ â¢ â¢
"The Ameer" at the Tivoli enters on
its thied week to-right and "with yet no
sign uf diminished popularity. It is
ftage*?. sung and acted in some respects
better than the original Kirke La Shelle
production, with Frank Daniels and r-'s
company, and it never falls below the
suindsxd set by the first company. Fer
ris Hartman, in the title role, is at his
funni.ttst; Webb -and Cashman are sturdy
helpers in the fun, and Anna Lfchtcr,
Frances Graham, Annie Myers, Harold
Gordon and Arthur Cunningham form a
melodious quintet, the equal of which
few other comic operas can produce. ThÂ»
next opera to be put on is the popular
"The fierenade," long a favorite with
the Eoatonians.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The Alcazar Theater will have a strong
attraction this week in Henry Arthur
Jones' brilliant play, "The Rogue's Com
edy." It is long since the comedy was
given !v;re, and its ingenious complica
tions and clever character drawing will
afiorft an opportunity to the strong com
pcr.y at the Alcazar Theater that the
plsys lately on its programme have denied
to -thf-jn. The bill for next week is "The
O-lenUil Express."
The farewell week of the Edwin Arden
engagement at the Grand Opera-house
Â¦will be given over to "Raglan's Way," a
drarn/i from the pen of Mr. Arden. "Rag
lan's Way" is said to be a better exam
ple of Mr. Arden's skill than the strong
melocrama "Zorah" that was given at
the tefpnning of the author-actor's en
gagement here, but if it is only as suc
ful a? "Zorah," Mr. Arden will number
tv.o 1 (lays that are both distinctly above
the twrage. The Grand Opera-house
stock company will be seen in support of
Mr. Arden. and with its recently
strengthened force will doubtless fulfill all
requirements.
"In the Palace of the King," which will
be repeated at the Columbia Theater this
week, is meeting with great success. The
tb( ater is crowded nightly to its capacity,
ar.<i the generous applause fully .testifies
to the enjoyment of the audiences. In
view of the large demand for seats, it has
been decided to give an extra matinee per
formance on Wednesday next. The play
is one of the best examples cf the modern
romantic cr^ma, and is acted by iliss
Allen and her company In thoroughly ef
fective fashion, iliss Allen as Dolores de
iitndoza has cne of her happiest oppor
tunities, and with "W. E. Bonney in a
powenul sketch of King Philip 11, Arthur
Hcyt in a clever study of the jester and
"W. B. Pascoe as the hero, Don John, and
the rest of the company forms a cast that
for even excellence has seldom been
equaled here.
;.*exf week the pastoral drama, "'Way
Dyva East," will be put on.
"The Sign of the Cross," a drama writ
ten by \\ ilson Barrett, began a two
weeks' engagement at the California last
night and scored a big success. The play
teils ol the struggles of the early Chris
tians under Nero's reign, and the com-
Uuxy is a capable one. Charles Dal ton as
iliifcus Superbus, Prefect of Rome, gives
& virile impersonation of the part. Miss
Mignon Shattinger as Mercia plays the
Christian girl in a. natural manner, and
Lhe rest of the cast is in good hands.
There are several new and attractive
features at the Orpheum J this week, and
arnont the most pleasing is Mary Nor
man. ,the society caricaturist, in her draw
ing: room monologue. She is exceedingly
clever, and her caricatures of the Boston.
Ban Francisco, New York and Chicago
young ladies were received la-st night
with hearty applause. She quickly estab
lished herself as a favorite with the audi
ence. The Dempsey and Mack Company
presents a laugnabie sketch, "A man of
Chance," by \N ilmer and Vincent. There
is nothing new in the plot, but the situa
tions tre complex and amusing and they
make the most of them. Wincherman's
trained bears ar.d performing monkey are
â¢well worth seeing- A big biack bear
seems to be almost gifted with human
Intelligence. Rose and Jeanette are dainty
terpsichorean artists and their stunt met
â¢with much favor. The marvelous Merrills
In their wonderful cycling feats continue
to astcnish and delight the audiences and
axe still the bright, particular attraction.
The Faust trio in their sensational suc
ctos. '"The Haunted Mill"; Joseph Keich
ei. s wonderfully clever dogs; Adellna
R, attino. the prima donna, soprano, and
xi.j American biograph make up a bill
tl.at it would be hard to excel for general
excellence. The orchestra deserves a
iv^rd of praise for the serio-comic fan
tasie, "A Trip to Coney Island," which
luerally brought down the house.

STOCKTON. Feb. 9.â The inquest on the
body of Mrs. Hammond Moore, who com
mittc-d suicide, in a 'local hotel; was held
last night. Dr. Fitzgerald testified that

The disabled steam collier Maria reached
port late last evening in tow of the steam
schooner Iaqua. The first notification of
the Maria's breakdown came ; from the
report made by the City of-Puebla. Tho
collier and schooner were - then about
twenty miles northwest of Cape Mendo

her way from San Diego north broke her
ehaft and was in hard straits .when picked
up by the Iaqua. > The latter was bound
from this port to Gray's Harbor and for
tunately had aboard' an unusually large
coal supply. The Maria is a big vessel
and the Iaqua's fee for salvage will be
a substantial one.

The British bark Pomona and tho Brit
ish ship Dechmont arrived yesterday from
Newcastle, Australia.' The voyage of the
Pomona was one long calm. "Poor trades
and little of them" is how Captain Cros
by sums up the story of his seventy-three
day dawdle across the Pacific. The Dech
mont came across in sixty-four days, but
given the wind a different reputation. She
encountered a number of blows, but on
January SO, in latitude 26 N., longitude
140 30 W., there 'came along- a northeast
erly gale- which threw the ship on her
beam ends and swept overboard every
thing movable. The sea filled the decks
to the rail. Two life boats were smashed
to smithereens and the ship's dingy was
washed overboard. With the dingy went
hen coops, buckets, capstan bars and a
miscellaneous lot of odds and ends. Sev
eral sails were blown away and for a few
hours life aboard the Dechmont was a
cold, wet tangle.

Corporal of Marines W. Couper, until
February 3 mail' orderly on . board the
United States gunboat Concord, is miss
ing. On the name roll of the ship's com
pany he is branded "deserter and de
faulter." Government ' detectives and
city and county police are on" his traclc
and things will gq hard with him when
captured. Couper left the Concord last
Monday with a bag of official mail. He
was also intrusted with the performance
of certain commissions for officers on
board. These commissions included, inci
dentally, the cashing of two checks, one
for 535, the other for $50. Couper pre
sumably got rid of the official mail in tho
regulation way. He also cashed the
checksâ the one. for $35 at the Richelieu
saloon and the one for $50 at a saloon at
684 Fourth street. He then got rid of his
leather mallbag, purchased a ticket for
San Jose, his native town, and has not
been seen since. Couper's punishment, if
caught, will be severe, as in his capacity
as mall orderly the confidence reposed in
him was very great: Sixteen members of
tho Concord's crew deserted â¢ the day
Couper disappeared, but firi "oer , is the

Judge Healey was a prominent figure in
Democratic political circles. He attended
nearly every State convention as a dele

against the State of Colorado or the Gov

will reply to this effect to the communi

the subject. The Attorney General's rr.
port on the incendiarism at Grand Mtsa
Lakes, which was forwarded to Secre
tary Hay, details the causes of the bitter
feeling against Radcliffe among the ln

the State made every effort to fix the re
sponsibility for the burning of Radcliffe's
property, but failed to apprehend the
guilty parties. Secretary Hay will be told
that the State is very sorry for Rad

The steamships City of Sydney and
Grant, which left their respective docks
on Saturday, did not get across the bar
until 8 o'clock yesterday .morning. The
bar was rough enough when they essayed
the crossing, and while in the midst of
the worst of it something went wrong
with the Sydney's engines and for more
than an hour the liner drifted about,
helriless. Just as the tug Defiance was
about to leave the bark she had -in tow
and goto the aid of the passenger ship
the repairs were completed, the Sydney a
propeller commenced to revolve and sho
soon got beyond the dangerous- rocka
upon which the tide was drifting her.
Her predicament was seen from the De
fiance and the Rescue, both tugs being in
the vicinity. On board each of the tugs
preparations were being made to go to
the Sydney's rescue when the latter s en
gines resumed operation. â¢

A varied programme confronts tho
House for the coming week. Owing to
the absence of a large number of Repub
licans who will go .to different pointo o*
the country to participate in the celebra
tion of Lincoln's birthday on Wednesday
consideration of the bill to repeal the
war taxes will be postponed until next
week. To-morrow is District of Colum
bia day. On Tuesday consideration of the
oleomargarine bill will be resumed under
the agreement made last week to devote
another day to general debate, followed
by a day of debate under the flve-minuta
rule. The passage of the bill by a larga
majority Is assured, although the substt
tute proposition probably'will command a
larger vote than it did In the last Con-"
gress. The Committee on War. Claims
will have a day following the disposition
of the oleomargarine bill, and the latter
part of the week will probably be de
voted to consideration of the Indian,
postofflce or army appropriation bill, all
of which are expected to be reported
earlier in the week. Â»
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.â The Philippine
question will continue to hold the fore
most place on the Senate calendar during
the present week, but there is little prob
ability that the Philippine bill will be dis
posed of before the close of the week.
Democratic Senators say they will require
several weeks more time in which to con
sider . the measure. Senator Lodge . as
chairman of the committee having thÂ«;
bill in charge has not failed to impress
upon them his intention ot pressing it
with the utmost dispatch consistent with
due consideration of no important a meas
ure. There are several Democratic Sen
ators prepared to speak on the bill.
Senator Quarlea will report the perma
nent census bill to-morrow before the
Philippine bill is taken up and will make
an effort to secure immediate considera
tion. If he succeeds the census bill prob
ably ' will alternate with the Philippine
bill for a few days. Senator Quarles hopes
that the census bill may be passed with
out much delay.' The irrigation bill also
occupies a place of vantage on the Son
ate calendar, and with the other bills
mentioned out of the way will be pressed
to the front.
Irons remained firm. The reports from
the Iron trade continue to grow better,
but those from the hardware trade are
unsatisfactory. Electrical shares were
realized upon during- the week while those
of the ocean transportation companies
rose slightly.
Coal shares receded generally' during
last week upon the Increasing slowness of
sales.
The reduction in the rate of discount by
the Bank of England awakened the ex
pectation that the Reichsbank would re
duce its rate of discount forthwith.
BERLIN, Feb. 9.â Notwithstanding the
fact that the Boerse was greatly disap
pointed at Great Britain's answer to the
Dutch note, the general tone of the mar
ket during the week remained firm. Spe
cial interest during- the week was at
tached to bank stocks.
The greatest interest still centers in
Kaffirs, in which the public is now dealing
with almost its ante-bellum enthusiasm.
There were strong evidences of profes
sional manipulation in the way succes
sive groups of shares are. lifted to sus
tain the general market level. American
securities more than held their own, in
spite of the postponement of the decision
in the matter of the Northern Securities
Company. As a. matter-of fact there has
been a marked improvement in Illinois
Central and Denver and Rio Grande. The
shipments of gold from New York to
Paris are regarded as a favorable fac
tor, indicating that Wall street is repay
ing Kurope for the securities purchased
last week and American houses were fur
ther strengthened by the sale here of
large quantities of American railway se
curities; consequently if the decision in
the Northern Securities Company is fa
vorable there is every, prospect of a de
cided boom in Americans in the near fu
ture. Â¦ â¢
LONDON, Feb. 9.â The activity on the

Only a Tew Days Left,
The Governor of the town ofCayasan,
in the province of Mlsamis, island cf
Mindanao, has resigned, declaring that
the military authorities there do not rec
ognize his authority, refusing to receive
his writs of habeas corpus.
Some months ago many of the leading
officials of Misamis province were arrested
because they tendered a banquet to. an in
surgent colonel, and because it was proved
that they had contributed funds to the
insurgent cause. At that ' time General
Davis, commanding at Zamboanga, Is
land of Mindanao, requested that the
province be transferred from civil to mil
itary control. The military authorities in
Misamis refused to allow the prisoners to
be - represented by a lawyer sent
by the civil commission from Ma
nila for that â¢ purpose, holding the
arrested persons to be prison
ers of war. Later General OhafEee in
structed General Davis to release the pris
oners,' and oflered the civil authorities in
formation is â¢ to when and where they
could arrest them should they desire to
do bo. But the fact that their offense
was committed before the passage of the
law of sedition makes further action in
the matter improbable. General Chaffee
deeming it inadvisable that, civilians
should be tried by a military commission.
The provinces under civil rule, as" well
as Manila. â¢ have been flooded with a
quantity, of pamphlets printed in Hong
kong.by the Filipino junta.- These pam
phlets are copies of a , memorial by the
junta, which has been forwarded to-Presi
dent Roosevelt.' The memorial expresses
sympathy at the death of Mr, McKlnley
and assures the American people, that
sooner or later the Filipinos are bound
to have. independence. The junta says it
has reliable information that most of the
pacified; provinces are heldjn check .only
by superior military forces. â¢ The : pam
phlets say that the educated Filipinos ap
preciate American governmental, ideas,
but when' the bread- of .national -life is
asked : for it does not suffice to offer a
stone,: even though that stone be a dia
mond. Â¦. -â¢ Â¦ Â¦ ' . .r _-â¢ ' : .Tr^.'i.v;

emergency cases. The first test, which
was conducted last week, between Kanka
kee and Kempton, a small station twen
ty-sU milea from this city on the south-
western branch of the Illinois Central,
was successful. A telephone instrument
was carried in an ensrine cab for tho ex
periments. A number of stops were- made
between Kankakee and Kempton and the
wire was strung between the engine and
telegraph line, and telephone communica
tion was established with the office of the
train dispatcher at Kankakee. "
The tests were entirely successful In
each instance, the telephoning over tht
telegraph wiresunot interfering with the
telegraph messages sent simultaneously.
Eventually all of the Illinois Central
trains! will be supplied Â¦with telephonic
equipment." Instruments will be placed In

There are many men who wear their

once became Infested with dandruff germs
the parasites would multiply all the

ness which is not healthy. The utterly
worn-out feeling experienced by so
many women is not due as a rule to
tho physical exhaustion of labor, but to
the draining away of the strength by
womanly diseases. Nervousness, head-
ache, backache, and sleeplessness are
but a few of the common results of such
a diseased condition. Yet thousands of
women suffer from wonanly diseases for
years and make little or no effort to
effect a cure, j They treat womanly dis-
ease as if it was a purely local thing, and
only wake up to the disastrous effect of
the disease upon the general health,
when there is an utter break down, fol-
lowed perhaps by years of painful 111-
ness.
HOW TO BE CURED.
Any woman suffering from womanly
disease can 'almost surely be cured by
the use of Dr, Pierce's Favorite. Prescrip-
tion. This statement is based on the
testimony of many thousands of women
who have been cured of womanly dis-
eases (often when aggravated by neglect
or wrong treatment, and generally of a
serious and painful nature.), by the use
of "Favorite Prescription."
. K I .used four bottles of your ! Favorite
Prescription J and one of "' Golden Med-
ical Discovery,' " writes Mrs. Elmer D.
Shearer, of Mounthope, Lancaster Co.,
Pa., "and can say that I am cured of
that dreaded disease, uterine trouble.
Am in better health than ever be fo re.
Every one who knows me is surprised
to see me look so well. In June, when
I wrote to you, I was so poor in health
that at times I could not walk. You

When the Lamp is : Lit
and the Children
are in Bed
The tired mother gets out her mending
basket and begins to darn, the holes
made in the hose by the restless feet of
her little ones. It is so good to be quiet
for a little she thinks. But very soon
the , over - wrought nerves assert k them- â¢
selves. , She feels dizzy,- her head throbs;
and she has to lay- aside the work- and *
creep .wearily to rest. Y.' : i: â¢Â¦'Â¦Â¦'" ' T ' >
All â¢work brings a natural weariness, a
healthy tiredness. But there : is iweari-
nes3 which is not natural and â¢ a tired-
answered my letter then and told me
.what to do â I< followed your advice, Â«n4
to-day am cured. I tell everybody that
with God's help, Dr. Pierce's medicines
cured me. If these few words are of
any use to you you are welcome to use
them. They might help some other
poor, suffering woman."
Mrs. Shearer's case is a -fair example
of the average cure effected by the use
of "Favorite Prescription" both in the
completeness and quickness of the cure.
Of course, in complicated and chronic
cases the cure may be slower but it is
none the less sure if the medicine is
faithfully used as directed. The record*
show that ninety -eight women in every
hundred who have given w Favorite Pre-
scription" a fair and faithful trial hare
been perfectly and permanently cured.
UNNATURAL CONDITIONS.
Every woman should remember that 4
diseased condition is unÂ«
natural. The natural
condition of the woman-
ly organism is a condi-
tion of health and "Fa-
vorite Prescription"
works with nature on
nature's lines to re-estab-
lish that condition of per-
fect health.
"I never courted news-
paper notoriety," writes
Mrs. E. A. Bender, of
Keene, Coshocton Co.,
Ohio, "yet I am not
afraid to speak a good
word for 'Favorite Pre-
scription' and 'Pleasant
Pellets,* Over a rear
ago I suffered terribly
for nearly four weeks
with prolapsus and weak-
ness. After using one
bottle of 'Favorite Pre-
scription' and one of
'Pellets* I was a well
woman. I have taken
no medicine since and
have had no symptoms
of my former " trouble.
Have used the ' Favorite
Prescription \ at different
times for more than four
years and rind it has no
equal."
When the womanly
health is re-established,
the general health at
once improves. There
is no more backache or
headache. The nerves
are quiet, the sleep is
sonna and the appetite
natural.
Dr. Pierce's Favorite
Prescription establishes regularity, driea
the drains which -weaken women, heals
inflammation and ulccration and cures
female weakness. It is the best prep-
arative for maternitv, giving muscular
strength and elasticity and rendering
the baby's advent practically painless. As
a tonic for weak and w run-down " women
it is unequaled, and nursing mothers
will find it superior to beer or any of the
medicines or beverages commonly be-
lieved to have a tonic and strengthening
value*. "Favorite Prescription" contains
no alcohol, neither opium, cocaine or
any other narcotic.

NAP A, Feb. 9.â George Head Jr., a
prominent young " merchant ot Â¦ this city,
dlsapgeared from his home here Saturday
afternoon and the supposition is that his
body lies at the bottom of the Napa Riv
er. Head left his home to go to his place
of business at his fathers' shoe store. He
did not put in an appearance, and in' the
evening a search was instituted for him,
but nothing: could be learned of his where
abouts during the night. This morning
the man's disappearance was partly
solved by the finding of his hat and coat
on a wharf at the rear of the Carpy wine
cellars. 5 Men have been dragging the river
bottom with a hope of finding the body,
but without success.

Major Terry is already receiving com
munications from, all parts of the United
States relative to the conference.
This, it is believed, will In time bring
all languages to the use of the same
orthography. Major Terry says that at
present the large number of alphabets in
use differ so widely in essential respects
that it is impossible to print one language
with the alphabet of another. Each lan
guage also has certain elementary sounds
peculiar to itself and having no repre
sentation in the alphabets of other lan
guages; hence no language can be cor
rectly represented in writing, nor can it
be learned from printed text, except hy
the use of its own alphabet. It is neces
sary in learning a new language to learn
a new alphabet.
TACOMA,' Feb. 9.â Major Frank Terry,
Supervisor of Indian Schools in Western
Washington, has started a movement for
an international congress to meet In
Washington, D. C, to devise and agree
upon an alphabet of printed characters
adapted to the uses of all languages. Con
gressman Cushman, at the i instance of
Major Terry, introduced a bill in Con
gress more than a month ago directing
the President to request all nations to
appoint a number of their distinguished
linguists and scholars to attend a con
ference to be held on January-1, 1903. The
objects which Mr. Terry hopes will be
attained by the conference are as follows:
First â To provide an alphabet for communi
cation and aid in foreign commerce.
Second â To facilitate the learning of foreign
languages.
Thirdâ To simplify the learning of English
and encourage the study of our language in for
eign countries.
Fourth â To establish uniform pronunciation
of geographical names.
Fifth â To provide co-ordinate orthography
for the English language, for the use of chil
dren in the primary schools. .
Sixthâ To fix a high and perfect orthographic
standard, to which spelling reforms the world
over may aspire. . Â¦ â¢

The President is devetlng a great deal
of his time to discussing this question
with members of Congress in both houses.
A member of the Senate who was pres
ent at the White House dinner given to
Governor Taft the other night, which was
attended by a dozen prominent members
of Congress, said to-day that the Presi
dent talked of little else. He impressed
on everybody present his earnestness for
the cause and his sincere belief that trou-
Dle would follow any delay. , - . Â¦â¢
If the present delay of two months is ex
tended two weeks more, when the time comes
for the Cuban Electoral College to meet, and
Senor Palma should, as Intimated, decline to
be a candidate for the Presidency, on the
ground that the failure of the United States to
help Cuba had made it impossible for a stable
Government to be maintained by the Cubans,
that . would be a very great calamity. " -
We hope to avoid such a grave contingency
as Senor Palma's refusal to assume office. It
has been explained to the President and Sec
retary Root that the only reason for delay is
that the general tariff revisers are waiting for
a chance to spring the Babcock bill and other
propositions. Members of the Ways and Means
Committee think they can stave off this dan
ger when Â¦ the war revenue reduction bill is
passed. Then we expect to see the committee
act for Cuba. t Â¦Â¦
An important official of the Government
who is in a position to know the exact at
titude of the, President and Secretary
Root said to-day:
Trouble is brewing here and will develop
later. The annexation sentiment is strongly
on the increase" and will, I think, come to the
front ' in case we fail at Washington or the
matter is long -delayed. -I recently took a
trip to the mountain districts and found the
potreros absolutely bare of cattle and the in
habitants almost too poor to obtain the bare
necessaries of life and utterly discouraged
over the situation. While many of them have
large tracts of land they cannot raise a dollar
to stock them or for any other purpose, and
never taste a morsel of meat.
In a letter from one of the best authori
ties on Cuban politics now on the island
occurs this startling statement:
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.-While the
administration Is bound to accept the as
surances which have been given to It by
a majority of the Republican members of
the Ways and Means Committee that they
will in time report a bill granting conces
sions to Cuba, the effect that this delay
will have upon the new. Government of
Cuba is, nevertheless, causing grave ap
prehension in Washington. " â¢ .
It Is said that unless conditions In Cuba
improve Senor Palma will decline to ac
cept the Presidency, as' it Is believed in
Cuba that unless relief is given the con
dition of affairs there will result In law
lessness tantamount to anarchy, and con
tinued military occupation by the United
States would be necessary.
President Roosevelt and Secretary Root
are, of course, anxious to -avoid the neces
sity for continued military occupation,
and the President is bringing to bear all
the pressure he can on the Ways and
Means Committee. . . . .
Special Dlasatch to Ths Call.
Delay .in Fixing Tariffs Is
Said to Be Cause of .;
. \. Discord.
Cuba's President - Elect
Occupies a Peculiar
; V Position.

TO HIS DEATH
At the conclusion of the sermon the
cadets, with right hand uplifted, took the
pledge of temperance for the next twelve
months. -The benediction of the most
holy sacrament and the singing, of the
Â£e Deum" brought the service to a close".
The cadets then marched dfiwn Van Ness
avenue to Turk street, where the regi
ment was to have been reviewed by the
Archbishop. Owing, to the bad state of
the street, which 1 prevented extensive
maneuvering, this feature of the day's ex
orcises was abandoned. This was the
first parade of the regiment under the
new commander, and the appearance pre
sented by 'the cadets was creditable to
them as an organization.

Mr. Mills announced that on next Sun
day evening he would reoeat. by special
request, his lecture on "The. Tyranny of
the Dead."' which he delivered in this city
two years ago. . . Â¦
Rev. Mr. Mills delivered a. lecture on the
subject "The "Women of To-Day", at the
First Unitarian Church at Oakland yes
terday morning. Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦ ,.- . Â¦â¢
Woman should be neither "a slave, a' toy,' a
pet. nor a queen." but a human being.' The
remedy for the evils of .liberty is more liberty.
"Let them be free to think,' to act, to , live, to
study, to experiment, to exercise Judgment, to
assume responsibilities and be held 'responsi
ble." . " .......
In the evolutionary process, the greatest
merit Is with the latest production/ and if this
be bo the free woman will be the' crowning
glory of the race. And not only shall the
creative power be hers t6 build human bodies,
but she may bring to birth the higher naturp
of a better humanity. â¢
Should Not Be Slaves.
Take away the religious walls that shut out
the counsel and inspiration of women! .Let
us have less dogmatism and more of the spirit,
less eccleslasticlsm and more Intuition' in re
ligion. .
.Woman has been conservative on' account of
her hard â¢ experiences Â¦ which^ have made her
timid and cautious. Let her become initia
tive and help to make the new earth wherein
dwelleth Justice!
We hear that some women do not want their
freedom. As Channlng , said about the slaves,
"The less they want freedom, the more they
need it." ' And it Is a significant fact that
every great woman of America during the last
fifty years has been an advocate of economic
and political enfranchisement for women. It
is time for the 250,000 women teachers of
America to say to the young men they train,
"If we have sense enough to educate you, we
know enough to vote with you." Emerson
said. "All my points would be sooner carried
if women voted." "
Take away the political barriers! It'may be
that woman will not make a good politician
according to present standards. She may not
vote to protect crime and jobbery, or cringe to
the liquor power or any unholy financial in
terest. But even if she should be as bad or
incompetent as I we men. I say. give her a
chance to be free. If there are barriers be
tween her and any effort for humanity, let
them be real and not formed by the supersti
tions, the conceit, or the selfishness of men.
Â¦,It. Is ."contempt not reverence that has kept
man from allowing women to be free"; con
tempt and fear! Â¦ ' Â¦ â¢
Give Women a Chance.
I believe that the time has come when
W nT en K, 1 l houW "** Â« n "Â«ly free f rom Trtifl?ia"
this or that let it.be determined by natural
fl^ e Â« n i he . r part " nd not. "by regulations en
acted exclusively by men and belonging to an
outgrown state of society. There should be no
that women differ from men more than they
really do; they are alike in ten characteristica
where they differ in one. Their iSSSertvi"
Ire e e S ! are the , 6ame - And - l say. make woman
If we are to live aright, by following the
tendency of human development thin there
can be no question about our duty. Man him?
self can advance only as woman advances _ with
Some men seem fearful that <f res wnmÂ«n
would^monopolize occupations unsuite^ 'to "thSS.
How do we know what Is unsuitable for them
until they have^had a fair chance to try / TakS
away all educational restrictions. Suimp the
?hÂ« Â°i n a Â», te i S Â°\ * lesser education for women with
H?V?Â£ el of the w Â°rld's dark ages. I notice
that throne candidate elected to the Oakland
bchool Board with practical unanimity waaTi
woman. Two women, axe more influential in
SSSSSSf JÂ£ e POllCy of our *Â«rr California
universities than any â¢ men.
* Take away the economic barrier*! It may
be that women are not fitted for some of our
present economic practices. Maybe they would
not believe In cut-throat competition and rail
road wrecking and Wall street gambling and
stock watering â¢ and uprlghteous monopoly
It may be they would find some way to im
prove a system under which one-tenth of the
people own more than one-half of the wealth
and ore-tenth of the Inhabitants of New York
and one-fourth of the inhabitants of London
are buried in the potter's field. It may be she
wauld really believe in brotherhood, not simply
to sing about in church but to practice in in
dustry and commerce.*
.Women Should Be Free.
As late as the sixth century the Christian
Council of Maeon seriously debated the ques
tion as to whether women have souls. In our
world of to-day, where all is new, we have
.also 'the new woman," new in her develop
ment and potency. She has made great
strides toward freedom, but still is bound, if
not enslaved, in many particulars. -
In the educational world many of the great
est institutions of Europe and America are
etlll closed to her. In the economic world
ro^ny barriers have been removed, but she is
still restrained by custom or- law from the
highest exercise of her talents. In politics
she Is still submitting "to taxation without
representation," and even the United- States
Government, whose charter of ireedom says
that Governments derive their just powers
fronrthe consent of the governed," has never
f^.ifi th ? "consent" of one-half of its most
intelligent citizens. In religion we have the
ludicrous spectacle of all the control being
iiv the hands of men and three-fourths, of the
devotees being women. Â¦. , Â¦
> The evolution of woman marks the progress
of civilization. Formerly the philosophers of
the Orient and the Occident. Hindoos, Mo
hammedans, Jews and Christians, united in
heaping contempt upon - woman. Plato said
ehe was "a disease." St. Jerome said "All
women are very evil and inspired of the devil."
Tertullian called her ;'the , gate of hell."
Erasmus said she wu "a stupid and silly ani
mal.". Judaism and 'Christianity have taught
that sin came into the world through woman.
Wife beating waÂ» lawful in England in the
nineteenth century and still is tolerated In
parts of Germany. An English Â¦ woman was
legally a serf until 1882.
Benjamin Fay Mills lectured to a large
audience at Golden Gate Hall last night
on the subject "The Woman of To-Day."
He said in part:
Are gamblers a class of citizens to be in
vited here by special legislation? I say no.
Friends, these men will take more money out
of the city than they spend. The money
gamblers spend is in buying legislation, in cor
rupting officers and- courts and in silencing
newspapers. The police court, the prison re
cord, th? morgue and women's tears have
written the history of the Ingleside track whr'n
It was open in this city. The men who vote
for the reopening of the track will vote ci-n
erious cf the ruin that the racetrack has cre
fctea in this <"ifv
I Â¦want to say that the women and children
and the moral and religious people of San
Francisco are a very considerable portion of
our cltlzensh:p. And I want to 6ay that the
ought to consider their interests
Â¦when they are engaged Jn passing laws Everv
cne of them will be Injured by the passage of
this bill. Every one of them, if they had a
vote would cppose the reopening of Ingleslde
IE this class unworthy cf consideration by the
lawmakers 7 I appeal to the Supervisors to
fcive us legislation for the women and children
of San Francisco. I say again that the vir
tuous rortion of cur citizenship have rights.
These women and children ought to be guarded
and protected by the legislative branch of our
Government. The Supervisors have wives and
children and in their name I call upon them
to stand to-morrow against the reopening of
Ingfleslde.
Virtuous Citizens Have Rights.
The proposition they are advancing is that if
Â»Â«^h V t :6 ?i lnK P^ ople wlU a "raÂ«ed here
and they ttui 6 pend money in our midst. That
Â»?n ak Â£-v mon ,* jr J out of the money they
w-111 spend >\"hat kind of money would it be?
It would be blood money. It would be money
rained out of the tears of the women of the
wÂ£, * nd out of Ule bl00(1 of ou r citizens.
Will we turn over our city to gamblers and
pllfertrs. because, perchance, while they are
hc <u"? I L e E*? d a few <JÂ«>Â»ars in our
inidst? Oh, I wish I had the privilege of talk
ing to the Board cf Supervisors themseives on
this Question.
The propowtion before the Board of Super
*isorÂ« is id nast them privileges that will
â¢work TV.n 10 all the geed people of this city.
Now the railroad n-.an and the hack man arid
the fted n.an ere saying that they lose thou
tandfe of dollars annually by Ingleside being
cUÂ»sÂ«d. Artn-.ittea, but thank God the city has
gained in n-.crals. felicity that cannot be meas
ured by e cld. We pass laws that will pre
vent tobbtrs from lolling our hanks, therefore
the robbers have a i:ght to complain, as th.sy
Joee tii-jufands every year. These men ought
to c.r.:p;ain because Ingleside is closedâ thj
rcbtiers ought to complain because they are
not granted the p:,viiege of robbing people
every year. -
Q*nÂ»UtnÂ» Imperils honert toll. It is the
enemy CM labor. It is indulged in simply to
uiftkÂ« Btcaey and live without toil. I thersfore
b*llcx-e ..iat evtry laboring man ought to bs
opjÂ« t-^ii 10 this mrfifure. Th!s country will
be v.-re'.ktd by the idl*rs, but Will be saved by
the tolie.K. Gambling leads to all kinds 0t
vice anJ brings tSiw upon a community. I
*jilitvt th.s ordinance should be opposed by
*vÂ«rry man who loves his country. No law
chcuia <-\u be passÂ«l that works an injury to
the l+ofVr cf a community. The gambler is
a !Â«Â«Â¦ breaker and as a class they have no
rights. Certainly they should have no privi
lege* because they bKng wreck and ruin to
gocd dtizerf.
Gambling Imperils Honest Toil.
-It !* time for the Beard of Supervisors to
aw&kea to its responsibilities. Good govern
ment is icunded on good morals. All good
fovtmnifM :r founded on good morals, there
fore I pray you. city fathers, do not under
min- tho tcundstion upon which pood govern
ment rettF. 'the strength of this in-eat repub
lic rest* ;n the virtue of her citizens. No law
i-hr-u.d ever b5 passed that lowers the standard
ct the people. If this measure is passed to
morrow jt will license people to make money
by eembHnjj. It will bring down the standard
of the pe'T-!e of San Franc.sco. 'Â¦"Â¦*â¢
Rev. A. C. Bane, pastor of the Califcr
nla-street Methodist Episcopal Church,
last r.ight voiced his prottst against the
reopening of the Ingleside racetrack. He
preached an eloquent sermon denouncing
gambling, and pointed out its attendant
evils. Mayor Schmitz had been Invited to
attend the services, but owing to an im
portant engagement was unable to be
present. Dr. Bane did not mince words m
his address. He called upon the Super
vIsojs to save the' city from the gamblers.
He appealed to them in. the name or' the
reepeÂ«. table element not to d-sgrace the
community by permitting the nerarlous
business to be carried on in their midst.
In j;art he spoke as follows:
When . the marching hosts Â¦ invaded the
cathedral the solemn notes of the: organ
pealed forth .the stirring strains of. a vol
untary. In the meanwhile the al
tar space was occupied .. by the
acolytes and the clergymen v/hrt
were to conduct the service. His
Grace Archbishop Riordan sat at the left
of the altar with Rev. : Father Phillip
O'Ryan, while to the right were . RevÂ«.
Fathets E. P. Dempsey and P. 'Mulligan.
Services at the Cathedral.
THE spacious Jnterior.of- St. Mary'v
â¢ Cathedral on Van Ness - avenue
Â¦ was crowded to its utmost capac
ity yesterday afternoon, when
thousands of young men who
make up' the League of the Cross renewed
their -vows to abstain from- the use of
intoxicating liquors during the ensuing
year. The ceremony accompanying the
pledge was a solemn one, and its im
presslveness was manifest by the signs
of emotion depicted in every face during
the service. Â¦ . ..'â¢,"."
The various companies, fully uniformed,
assembled on Turk street, near Van Ness
avenue, at 2 o'clock, and twenty minutes
later Colonel Dar.iel Deasy gave the or
6"er to march. The column, -Â»00 strong,
then filed into the avenue, headed by the
band, and marched in fours to the cathe
dral. Large crowds'- lined the avenue on
both sides, and at the step3 leading to the
rarsctuary a dozen policemen' found them
selves fully occupied in- keeping back th"s
crowds which sought admittance. Tlie
junior members of the'league had previ
ously been admitted, and these;-number
ing many hundreds, occupied the right
and left pews, while the center, pews were
reserved for the League of the Cross Ca
dets. The galleries were filled with rela
tives and friends of the. young men.
