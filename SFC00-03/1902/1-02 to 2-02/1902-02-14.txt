Never since the death of Blanche.La

, case so revolting, so sad as that, which
has centered all interest in the city these
past few days. At no time has there
come a sorrow which has elicited such
universal grief, and If he, the pastor,
could speak for the bereaved family, they
would be words of the greatest gratitude
for the tenderness and . kindness which
.have come to them from the people of
San Francisco.
Mr. Bane delivered an eloquent and pro
found address, dealing not alone with the
fiend whose crime has stirred the whole
land, but also with the duties of the
parent toward the child and the child's
loyalty to the parent. His tribute to the
virtue and the lovable nature of Nora
Fuller, his pride in the remembrance that
she had forfeited her young life in de
fense of her honor were brought out dis

SAN JOSE, Feb. 13.â For a time last
night the police believed they had found
John Bennett, the much-wanted murderer,
in a lodger at Hhe Lefranc rooming-hcuse
on West'Santa Clara street. Mrs. Elliott,
who conducts the place, reported to the
police that she had a' lodger who was a
man of mystery. She stated she did not
knowwhen the man came to her house,
but he, had a room there four weeks when
she . purchased the place. Some ' days ! ago
a young.woman appeared at the lodging
house in-, company with him.. He intro
duced the woman as a friend from San
Francisco and said her name was Miss
Bennett. She remained over night anJ
then left. The landlady thought her
lodger was none other than Bennett from
the fact- that the woman had given her
name as such.
Officers Plummer and Campbell found
the man in rooms 32 and 33 of the Lefranc
building last night. He gave his name as
M. H. Shephard and stated he had been
In San Jose for four months. He did not
tally with' the 'description given of Ben
nett. Shephard is a much larger man,
but he has the same blonde mustache
and complexion. The mysterious Miss
Bennett was said to -have answered an
advertisement for 3, housekeeper an-}
came here to act In that capacity for
Shephard. â¢ ! â¢ :\^
The suspect, however, added a tinge of
mystery to thecarie by disappearing. thi3
morning. "He -was "known to "> be in his
room up to 3 o'clock, but' some time be
itween that and morning he disappeared.
The rooms show evidence of a hasty de
parture on the part of its occupant. Mrs.
Elliott, the' landlady, is minus her lodger
and two months' rent. ' . â¢
While the police are satisfied there is
something in the man's life he wishes to
hide, and for this reason has gone, they
are satisfied he is not Bennett. Investi

HIS IDENTITY REMAINS 1
STILL IMPENETRABLE
i The motive for so abhorrent a crime Is
as mysterious as the personality of the
perpetrator. The hypotheses at first ad
vanced that the girl had been lured to
the house and had died under the abuse
of the seducer, Â»r that she had volun
tarily submitted to the wishes of the man
Bennett and had made away with herself
from remorse, have never-been seriously
entertained. The police, in. the light of
all the information that has been gath
ered, have come to the conclusion that
she was murdered the night of her dis
appearance from her mother's home.
In fact she was probably rendered un
conscious upon her entrance to the house
and never realized the indignities or the
violence to which her bruised body shows
she was subjected. Still there is al
most conclusive evidence to show . that
somebody, presumably the murderer, vis
ited house at least three days after
the murder was committed. Hence the
detectives have concluded that the slayer
is one of those strange creatures which
humanity has developed In every age,
who is alien to the ordinary thoughts and
motives of men, and who would return to
the scene of horror for the satisfaction
and pleasure he might gain from such a
visit as long as he felt there was no dan*,
ger. of discovery. . Â¦ - .- . .-
Only one additional clew was the , fruit
of yesterday's investigation, and this
proved of no value. H. Hogensen, a wait
er employed in a Montgomery-street res
taurant, called on Captain Seymour for
the purpose of informing him of a man
he thought might be the much-wanted
Bennett or Hawkins. He said that nine
years ago he knew a man named Tomlin
sdn in Portland who answered H the I de
scription given of the murderer, and that
he understood this man served a term in
San Quentin for forgery. Two months
ago he- met him on Grant avenue. A
search of the records showed that J. H.
Tomlinson had been sentenced to San
Quentin for forgery from San Francisco
in 1893. At that tima he was 63 years old,
which would make him 62 years of age
now, and there were other discrepancies ,
that put him out of the question as the ]
suspected murderer of Nora Fuller. -
Yet out of a whole city full of men and
women ,_who have undoubtedly met this
man during the frequent periods he spent
in San Francisco there is not one who
can or will give the information that will
lead to the capture of the fiendish slayer.
Where he roomed, I who his companions
were, how he spent his time, what his
business was are questions yet unsolved.
Krooe somehow got", the idea that he was
a traveling man, but does not know why
he had that impression, except possibly
from the fact that Bennett, as he called
himself, visited the restaurant periodi
cally.' There was a total disappearance
for. about eight years,, and this has given
rise to the theory that the murderer may
be an ex-convict and had been imprisoned
during that time. Whatever or whoever
he Is he has left no trace behind him by
which the police have been able to trace
him beyond the lintel of the house in
which the crime was committed.
The hunt has narrowed down to one
man, of whom the police have a good
description. He has been known at periods
for fifteen years. by J. W. Krone, proprie
tor of the Popular restaurant on Geary
street, who has seen 'him of ten, . conversed
with him Â¦ frequently and is enabled to
give a good description of .'the man 1 } to
wh6m all signs point as - the criminal
wanted. â¢ Two second-hand dealers and
the real estate man from whom the house
was rented coincide with the description
given by ; Krone. . â¢
Chief of Police Wittman and Captain
Seymour, chief of the detective force,
have given their full attention to the case,
and ' the j best criminal catchers ' of the
force are employed upon it. So far there
have been no results further than that of
eliminating from the search a large num
ber of men who- by their- physical re
semblance to the descriptions of Bennett
and their doubtful pasts were originally
objects.of suspicion.
After six days of unavailing, search for
the murderer of ' pretty Nora Fuller the
police of San Francisco and the public at
large are as much in the dark concerning
the identity of the perpetrator of the atro
cious crime and - the motive . which
prompted it as they were on the night the
body was found in the empty dwelling on
Sutter street. All clews and theories that
in any manner appeared as though they
might lead to the - unraveling of the tan
gled web of crime have been diligently
and intelligently, followed. Suggestions
and statements of facts have poured In
upon the detective department and the
newspapers' by. the hundreds, and every
one of these has been given the fullest
consideration and investigation. None of
them has served . in the least to fasten
the crime upon any individual who has
come under notice of the police or who
can be reached by them.

TARIFF MEASURE
FOR PHILIPPINES
Gage Men Look Fearfully on an Anti-
Machine Sentiment.
There is a feeling akin to fear In the
camp of the Gage 'followers. It Is caused
by the spread of anti-machine sentiment
In Southern California and the organiza
tion cf Flint clubs in Los Angeles.
When open opposition to Gage In his
home county was first announced the sup
porters of the Governor fancied that the
opposing forces were simply boasting of
what they could do, having no serious in
tention of going into a fight to send an
anti-Gage delegation from Los Angeles to
the next Republican State Convention.
Subsequent happenings have caused the
Gage men to change their minds. A few
days ago Johnny Mackenzie left San Joce
for a southern trip, giving out the word
that he was going to Yuma. Last
Wednesday evening Governor Gage left
San Francisco for Los Angeles. John C
Lynch, United States Collector of Internai
Revenue, went south a few days earlier
Testerday afternoon Jesse Marks made
haste to catch the "Owl" for a flying trip
to Los Angeles.
There were rumors in the Gage camp
last night that the Governor had decided
SOTJTH CAUSES AT.A-R.-M".
6i>ecial DisDatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 13.â The Herald
to-morrow will say:
Governor Gage arrived In Los Angeles
last night from his mine, where he has
been spending several days. He went im
mediately to his office in the California
Bank building, where, asked as to his can
didacy, he said: .
"There axe certain conditions personal to
myself, which 1 shall not here refer to,
preventing me at this time from going
further than to say that I shall probably
permit my name to go before the Republi
can convention.
"The people are well aware that I have
labored ceaselessly to carry out all of my
party and platform pledges and that I
nave carried out every pledge of the
party; and I have given the State an in
dependent, a clean, nonest and economical
administration. One illustration of that
economy is that this year's tax rate Is the
lowest ever given to ine State of Cali
fornia. My appointees have all proven
officially honest, competent and trust
worthy.
What the People Think.
"There seems to be a widespread incli
nation on the part of the people, so far as
I am able to judge from personal contact
and reports coming to me from all parts
of the State, to indorse my administration
by a renomination. If this is the purpose
of the people it will certainly be the high
est possible honor which could be con
ferred upon an acting Governor of this
great State.
"If this is the popular desire it appears
to be opposed only by a certain coterie of
newspaper bosses and their adherents,
some of whom are would-be political
bosses, others displeased on account of po
litical appointments, and also some others
who honestly do not understand -the real
situation.
"The active malignity of these news
paper political bosses, or of any other ene
mies in Los Angeles or elsewhere, will
have no tendency whatever toward deter
ring me from entering the race for re
nomination, but, on. the contrary, will
rather incline me to the contest, especial
ly should I conclude that the wishes of
the rank and file of the party throughout
the State are in favor of my making the
battle.
"The people know whom to nominate,
and they will determine at the proper
time that question in their own way with
out reference to the newspaper bosses and
their adherents, just as they did in my
case in 1898. In 1%9S there went up a loud
cry from some of the selfsame forces at
present arrayed against me calling for a
Senator and not a Governor from the
south, met then by my suggestion that
both a Senator, and a Governor could
come from the south, which has become
a demonstrated fact.
Words for the Editors.
"In 1S98 the Evening Express of Los An
geles and its followers most bitterly as
sailed my candidacy. In 1S9S the Los An
geles Times after my nomination predict
ed my defeat, because I would not obey
Its demands to dismiss from the Republi
can Executive Committee of the State
those sterling Republicans Frank P.
Flint. Major H. Z. Osborne and Walter
Parker, ail of whom had filled exactly
the same positions during the. great cam
paign of 1&96, successfully made on behalf
of our late martyred President, William
McKinley.
"The people decided against these
papers In 1S98 and settled the controversy
by according to me the nomination by ac
clamation, and also the election by a
splendid majority, just as the Los Angeles
Record alone among the then Republican
dailies of Los Angeles city had from the
first predicted. Whatever the people de
sire, whatever their will may be in 1502i
will be perfectly satisfactory to me."
Continued From Page One
those who knew her best she had been
held in the highest esteem.
With earnestness and deep emotion tne
reverend gentleman said that in order to
correct some erroneous Impression they
had thrown open that temple of God to
stamp the life and pure character of little
Nora Fuller. If they could ask her Sun
day-school teacher he would give such an
account of the child that all such impres
sion would vanish. Nora was a martyr
to virtue and womanly honor. She was
not the first martyr, but there were many
girls who chose to sacrifice their honor
sooner than life; but this girl preferred
death to dishonor.
Victims of Circumstances.
Speaking of the unhappy financial cir
cumstances of the family, which caused
Nora to seek a position, Mr. Bane wished
that those who were given the world's
good fortune did but know the victims of
circumstancesâ the suffering, the agony,
the straits to which the poor were driven.
If they, the wealthy, would but go out
among them they could relieve much sor
row, ruin and disaster. It was -because
pressed by poverty that the mother al
lowed the girl to answerithat fatal adver
tisement, in the hope that it would be a
means to help to support the family. The
grinding of the poor was a menace to the
morals of the people. How many moth
ers were there who were compelled to
leave their homes to work, leaving their
families hardly attended, and some abso
lutely unattended? But it was compulsory
on them to submit to such a condition in
order to maintain the household. How
many little -girls and lads, he asked,
through poverty were thrown out on the
wicked world In order to appease the
pangs of hunger?
The death, sad as it had been, has been
a lesson and he trusted it v would be well
learned. Nora Fuller had died for others
â that others might be saved such a death
as came to her. The lessons drawn were
not in connection with her home relations,
hut regarding men (could they be called
men) who preyed upon virtue and woman
ly honor â fleiWts, who by the aid of an ad
vertisement.^cot the guileless, the innocent
in their lecherous clutches. He declared
that conditions would not be well in the
future for such fiends in the community.
"There are men and women who spend
a lifetime in prosecuting the downfall of
young girlsl They must be brought to
time," declared Mr. Bane. "In this city
and throughout the land there is a traffic
and men for so much a head procure lnÂ«
nocent girls. People of California will
demand legislation in future to meet the
crime."
Advises Protection by Mothers.
Continuing bis description of this social
evil Mr. Bane said he believed that moth
ers were going to be more careful. They
could not blame this mother. Her un
happy circumstances were such at the
time that her daughter was obliged to
seek employment, -but she, Mrs. Fuller,
would warn all mothers that if their
daughters must find work they should go
with them in the search for occupation.
He' warned girls against temptations
and snares and showed the necessity for
the chaperone. He said that in their
modesty and their quietness was their
defense and prayed for their own sakes
neither by look nor word would they re
spond to attentions given them on the
streets by men, by strangers, by lecher
ous men. The defense of honor lies in the
homes and not in the lodging-housesâ in
the homes of sunshine is to be found the
defense of our morals. There are so
many men, shame to say, so brutal and
fiendish that it seems that every girl is
born into peril.
He besought fathers and mothers to
keep close to their daughters and lead
such a life that the daughters will cling
to them.
After the solemn service at the church
the remains were taken to .Cypress Lawn
to make open declaration of his candi
dacy for another term. It was said that
his closest advisers in Sacramento, San
Francisco and Los Angeles were urging
him to speak out unreservedly an* de
clare himself in the race.

Peculiar Powar Possessed by a
New Medicine.
Of new discoveries there is no end. but one of
the most recent, most- remarkable and one
which Will prove . invaluable to thousands of
people, is a discoverey which it Is believed will
take the place of all other remedies for the
cure of those common and obstinate diseases,
dyspepsia and stomach troubles. This discov-
ery is. not a loudly advertised, secret patent
medicine, but is a scientific combination of
wholesome, perfectly harmless vegetable es-
sences, fruit salts, pure pepsin and bismuth.
These remedies are combined In lozenge form,
pleasant to -take, and will preserve ..their good
qualities indefinitely, whereas all liquid medi-
cines rapidly lose whatever good qualities they
may have had as soon as uncorked and exposed
This preparation is called Stuart's' Dyspepsia
Tablets and It is claimed that one of these tab-
lets or lozenges will digest from 300 'to 3000
times Its own weight of meat, . eggs . and other
Â¦wholesome food. And this claim has been
proven by actual experiments Â¦ in the following
manner: A hard boiled' egg cut- Into small
pieces was placed in a bottle containing- warm
water heated to ninety-eight degrees (or J>lood
heat), one of these Tablets was then placed in.
the .bottle Â» and the proper temperature - main-
tained for three hours and a half, at the, end of
which time. the egg was as completely digested
as it would have been in a healthy stomach.
This experiment was. undertaken to demonstrate
that what it would do In the bottle It would
also do in the stomach, hence- its unquestionable
value In the cure of dyspepsia and weak diges-
tion. Very few people are free from some form
''of indigestion, but scarcely two will have the.
satne symptoms. Some will suffer most from
distress after eating, bloating from gas in the
stomach and bowels, others have acid dyspepsia
or heartburn, others palpitation or headaches,
sleeplessness, pains in chest and under shoulder
blades, extreme nervousness as in nervous dys-
pepsia, but they, all have same cause, failure to
properly digest .. what- Is eaten.- The stomach
must have rest and assistance, and Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets give it both, by digesting the.
food for it and In a short time it is restored to
Its norrral action and vigor. At same time the
Tablets are so harmless that a child can take
them with benefit. This new preparation has
already made many astonishing cures, as for
Instance, the following: . â¢ .
After using only one package of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets I have received such great and
unexpected, benefit that I -wish to express my
sincere gratitude. In fact It has been six
months since I took the package and I have not
had one particle of distress or difficulty since.
And all this in the face of the fact that the
best doctors I consulted told me my case was
Chronic Dyspepsia and absolutely incurable, as
I had suffered twenty-five .years. I distributed
half a dozen packages among my friends here
who are very anxious to try this remedy.

In shipping circles, however, it is gener
ally understood; that Downs' visit' to San
Francisco is for the purpose of adjusting
matters amicably, as a rate war would be
disastrous to all. - " ...
This acKon on the part of the North
American Transportation and Trading
Company caused a serious breach and
from indications will cause a break and
the inauguration of a rate war during
the coming season. Auditor Downs of the
North American Transportation and
Trading Company, while passing here to
day on the Umatilla, for San Francisco,
would neither affirm nor deny the report
of a prospective rate war, but simply
stated that such a thing was among the
possibilities.
Last season, before northern navigation
opened, the Alaska Commercial Com
pany, the North American Transportation
and Trading Company, the Empire Trans
portation Company and the Seattle and
Yukon Transportation Company, . all run
ning lines of steamers to St. Michael and
Nome and also conducting trading posts
along the Yukon, formed a combination
und?r the name of the Northern Naviga
tion Company. -
The North American Transportation and
Trading Company only entered the trans
portation combine, keeping its trading
business along the Yukon separate. A
female of prices .was agreed upon and was
illthfully carried out by the various com-
Anies. The profits of the season reached
.aamy thousands of dollars.
Everything worked harmoniously â¢ util
Just before navigation closed last season,
when the combine shipped a lot of goods
to St. Michael, bound for trading posts
along the Yukon. The : North American
Transportation and Trading Company's
goods were rushed up the river first and
a large amount of the combine's goods
were left at St. Michael, where they now
remain.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. 13.â
A break in one of the strongest trans

Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex., Feb. 13.-EIghteen years
ago James Leonard, who for many years
has been a prominent and honored busi
ness man of Hondo, Tex., attempted to
hold up and rob a saloon at Princeton,
Colusa County, Cal. In the hold-up he
shot and killed the proprietor, Charles
Hemstreet. Leonard fled and located at
Hondo, this State, where he has led a
modesty and upright life. During all these
years he has been conscience-stricken
ove . r ,} h S crlm ? committed in California
and it has weighed so heavily, upon his
mind that several days ago he made a
?Â£ U Â£ nd . free confession of the crime to
the District Attorney of Uvalde County
Acting upon the confession, the officers
of _ Colusa County, Cal.. were communi
cated with and an investigation was Insti
tuted which resulted In Leonard's story
of the hold-up and murder being verified
In every particular. Governor Sayres to
day honored a requisition by the Governor
of California for the return of Leonard
to the scene of the murder, where he will
stand trial for the crime. Sheriff J H
Sherer of Colusa County was here to-day
on his way to. Hondo, where he will take
charge of the self-confessed murdere?
and return with him to California.

In regard to the immediate causes of the
war, - continued ; Chamberlain, it was not
only impossible' for a great nation to al
low its subjects to be humiliated or op
pressed, .its engagements broken and
black races oppressed, but the very ex
istence, of i the, empire was Involved, and
the Government was pledged to continue
It until the danger from which they had
escaped was forever averted.
After a reference to "shallow observers
abroad, who foretold Great Britain's
downfall," Chamberlain concluded with a
glowing, tribute to the colonies, who
throughout the war, he said, had demon
strated their intention to share the obli
gations as well as the privileges of the
empire. It was a long step toward the
consolidation which was now within
measure of practical accomplishment. He
did not envy the statesman who would be
willing to compromise the issue for which
the empire fought. The nation was not
vindictive to its enemies. If they surren
dered to-day they would be welcomed as
friends to-morrow. The expulsion of those
who caused the war was only a measure
of self-preservation. Similarly, immunity
for treason was not humanity, . but was
cruelty to the loyalists and to the Boers,
who now in thousands, Â¦_ recognizing the
futility of the struggle, were aiding Great
Britain to end the war. In justice to those,
who had died, and as , security ' for tXs
survivors, the Boers must be made "to
recognize that they are divided," and from
them must be taken the barest possibility
of repeating the attempt. To do otherwise
would be to invite the contempt of for
eign countries, whose affection it seemed
impossible for them- to gain, .but whose
respect, at any rate, Hhey were . able to
secure. Â¦ / .
. Replying to a toast to himself and wife
at the luncheon, which took place In the
Mansion House, Chamberlain said: i
"My wife is of two nationalities, but as
those are the two which it is the chief ob-J
ject of our diplomacy to keep in /agree
ment and affectionate accord, I hope you
will think that my wife's position is no
disadvantage." (Mrs. Chamberlain was a
Miss Endicott of Boston. Her father was
Secretary of War in President Cleveland's
Cabinet.) " : â¢ â¢â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦': .
Referring to the colonial support of the
South African war, Chamberlain observed
that it would nave special effect in. the
"United States, "whose , friendship we' de
sire, of ail others, to keep and enjoy.','
LONDON, Feb. 13.â This metropolis be
stowed its highest distinction on Joseph
Chamberlain, the Colonial Secretary, to
day, when at the Guildhall it conferred
on him the freedom of the city. Mrs.
Chamberlain accompanied * her husband,*
and they were greeted on their arrival
with a fanfare of trumpets. Mr. and Mrs.
Chamberlain were conducted to the libra
ry, where they were received by the Lord
Mayor, Sir Joseph Dimsdale, and the
Lord Mayoress. THe hair was crowded,
among those present being Chamberlain's
political colleagues and adherents, who
duly applauded the bestowal of the city's
freedom.- The address in connection with
the presentation congratulated Chamber
lain on the eervices he had rendered to
the empire during the last twenty-five
years, dwelling especially on the way in
which he had welded the colonies to
gether.
In replying Chamberlain disclaimed any
intention of making political capital out of
the occasion, but he said he thought he
might, in behalf of the Government, make
an appeal for national support. The Gov
ernment had two great national objects
In viewâ to establish beyond question Brit
ish authority in South Africa and to
maintain the unity of the empire. Both
objects were involved In the South Afri
can war. The war would always be mem
orable because it had called out a greater
military effort- than ever, before asked
from Great Britain, and because it had
shown to friend' and foe the potential
strength and almost inexhaustible re
sources of the empire. He had not

This lasted for some twenty minutes,
when gradually the rattle died down. Only

all was quiet again. The Boers' attempt
to break the British circle had failed. A

LONDON, Feb. 13.â The detailed ac
counts which have just reached here of
Lord Kitchener's combined movement to
drive out the Boers from the inclosure of
blockhouse lines show that the conflict
was very picturesque and the most ex
citing incident of .the whole campaign.
Although apparently surrounded by an
impenetrable ring of fire and steel, the
Boers vrtth dauntless bravery and. dash
ing charges ultimately escaped from the
meshes of Lord Kitchener's close drawn
net. , \
The British commander s scheme was
the most extensive ever carried out dur
ing the present war. It consisted" of a
continuous line of fifty miles in length.
Lord Kitchener personally directed opera
tions and was soon in dose tough 'With
every detail of the movements. The Boers,
though hard pressed," shrank .from at
tempcing to cross 1 the railroad, which was
patrolled throughout the night by armored
trains equipped .with powerful search
lights. The train lights were sup
plemented by stationary searchlights,
and the spectacular effect was most
striking. By the side of. the rail
road were the dark forms of men lying in
trenches or 'standing doing sentry duty.
The gloom of the moonless night was Â¦â¢ in
termittently relieved by the sweep of the
searchlights. â . ' Â¦
The battle at Heilbron raged from - 4
o'clock Friday night until Saturday mornr
ing. From various positions behind rocks
the Boers kept up a vigorous fusillade,
hoping to find a weak spot in the line.
Simultaneously others charged, but again
and again were the Boers repulsed, leav- '
ing dead, wounded and prisoners in the
hands of the British. ?
At the outset of the preparations the
Boers realized that the operations were
not merely an ordinary "drive," but a
movement threatening them with total
annihilation, and General Dewet. assem
bled his whole force and discussed the
situation with the commanders, with the
result that the Boers were split into three
forces. On Thursday night 500 Boers
rushed a force of Imperial Light Horse.
About 100 burghers got through, but the
remainder, encountering a tremendous
fire, were turned back.
Friday night's conflict ebbed and swelled
over an area of forty to fifty miles, in
which the long-hunted, â harassed and
desperate men endeavored to find outlets.
The Boers at one spot got within thirty
yards of the British firing line, but the
barbed wire balked the burghers and
forced them to retreat. The firing now
ceased. Aided by the electric searchlights
the British harrowed the surrounding
territory with shrapnel, shells and Maxim
bullets. In the northern section the Boers
made a desperate effort to break through.
Collecting a number of cattle, the Boers
drove them down on the British lines.
Bending low in their saddles, they rode
among the cattle, making it impossible to
distinguish them in the darkness.
The British pickets opened a .terrible
i flre and the Boers were everywhere met
I with a relentless hail of bullets. A long
line of flame ran up and down the firing
line, nearly thirty miles in. length, as the
armored trains flashed their searchlights
over miles of country. .The reports of the
quick-firing guns , along -the- entrenched
line and the booming of the Reid.. guns
and pompoms sounded, very deep amid
the sharp crackling of the musketry,
while Heilbron fort contributed to the din
I with the deep roar of its naval gun.
W WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.-At an

V v f rage Association to-day, held
previous to the calling to
gether of the regular, convention, the sub.
ject of organization and advancement of
the cause of woman suffrage was dis
cussed. Mary G. Hay of New York pre
sided. She said two State officers had
remarked that woman suffrage would
come just the same if there was no or
ganization;- that it would come through
the process of evolution. This statement
caused a number of the delegates to'aiu
nounce .that they wished It known that
they entertained no such sentiments and
asked for the names of the. two State
officers, ! but Miss Hay declined to give
them. Education, Miss Hay argued, was
necessary to . success. . She advised all
present to Join clubs, "with the idea of
sowing a little suffrage seed." She de
clared that evolution might bring suf
frage, but It would be accomplished
quicker if evolution was helped along.
Increased Aotivity Urged.
A number of the delegates urged in
creased - activity in the matter ot mem
bership, f
Mrs. Catt said she would be glad if a
resolution would be introduced in the con
vention to double the membership and
thereby set everybody to work. Two years
ago, Mrs. Catt explained, after the con
vention had' adjourned, a "request was
sent throughout the nation to try to
double the membership, but some people
felt that it did not receive the inspiration
it would have had had the convention in
dorsed it. The. members at once acted
upon the suggestion and decided if to be
the Â¦ sense of the -organization that all
should join in an effort to double the
membership. : Â¦

The Lautaro has had a stormy career.
This episode in Panama Bay makes the
third time she has gone to the bottom.
She was built in 1872 for the Compania
Sud Americana de Vapores. During the
war between Chile and Peru she was used
as a transport by the Chilean Government.
She was captured by the Peruvians, with
Colonel Bulnes and his regiment of cav
alry aboard, and taken to Callao. When
the Chileans took Lima the Peruvians
sank all the ships, including the Lau
laro. which was then known as the
Uimac and lying at Callao. She was
raised, taken to Valparaiso and there
bought at auction by her original owners.
When leaving Los Vilos about three years
jigo ehe hit a rock and once more went to
the bottom. She was raised, renovated
and has been usefully engaged until the
Colombian Government took possession of
her and used her for a navy. -She will
prohably be raised again, as, although she
took fire during the battle and although
several explosions took place on board,
she was four hours sinking and is not
thought to be badly damaged.
;Â»f|Â«^HE steamship Guatemala arrived
jj yesterday from Valparaiso. She
I brought about twenty passengers
UL and 500 tons of freight, including
five cases of treasure. Â¦ Among
the passengers was John Bradbury of Los
Angeles, who has been south looking after
his mining interests. The Guatemala ar
rived in Panama the day after the naval
battle and anchored within a few feet of
the sunken Lautaro. The officers of the
Guatemala say that there was little ex
citement in Panama as the result of the
battle. There were about 3003 soldiers In
the city and preparations were under way
to resist any furtber attack by the Insur
gents, but stores were all open, trains
running and business gping on pretty
much as usual. The soldiers of the repub
lic are mostly small boys. .The regiments
are accompanied by womeji, who carry
the knapsacks for such of the little sol
diers as possess them, attend to the
cooking of euch food as can be got and do
a Httle of the fighting when occasion
calls. When the Guatemala Jeft Panama
an effort was being made to, recover the
body of General Alhan, which. went down
with the Lautaro. Alban's successor was
expected to arrive from Barranquilla
somÂ« days after the Guatemala sailed.
NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
â¢y^ t Italisr: ship Sajvatore Ciampa will load
uhciu" at thls port * or Europe. STt 6d; the
The non-arrival at Oyster Bay of the
ship Oriental is causing some anxiety.
She left here twenty-eight days ago. The
voyage usually takes about a week. A
morning paper now running a marine ex
change reported the arrival of the Ori
ental at Oyster Bay a week ago. The
local agents wired there yesterday and
were Informed that the vessel had not
rut in an appearance. The steamship
Hyades. reported by this marine ex
change an Sunday as a few miles out,
ilia not arrive until last evening, and the
I?ritish ship Cawdor. reported by the
f=ame concern several days ago, has not
yet arrived.
Erroneous Shipping' Keports.
Outside fer Six Days.
The schooner Viking, forty-three days
from Guaymas and for the last week
boating about the vicinity of the Faral
lones. get into port yesterday somewhat
disabled. During the voyage a heavy north
wester carried away the schooner's fore
masthead and disabled her steering gear.
When she got off the port the southeast
erly Â¦weather -was too much for her In. her
broken-down condition. For four days she
beat about trying to get a* friendly slant
of wind, and when it did come the bar
was too rough for safe crossing, so for
forty-eight hours she remained at anchor
near the lightship.

The Charge Against Dr. T. L. Keegan
' 4 Is Dismissed by Judge Ca- '
baniss.
Dr. T. L. Keegan, a\recent graduate of
the California Medical* College, ; appeared
before Judge Cabaniss yesterday.: on a
charge of assault with a deadly weapon.
The complaining witness was \ Ernest
Gray, a student at the college.,
The evidence showed that last Tuesday
Dr. Keegan entered the waiting-room at
the college, part of which is used: as. a
pTiarmacy, and ' saw Gray talking to 'a
woman patient. Keegan ,-' remonstrated
with him and told him' he should know
that students had no right to give medical
advice. Gray retorted that he had: as
much right as Keegan and attempted to
eject him from the room. Keegan drew, a
small nail cleaner out of his vest ' pocket
and cut Gray on the thigh. Gray weighs
about 190 pounds and Keegan. about- 110
pounds. ; Â¦ , . !.'.>-Â¦ \. Â¦ ' 'yj :
Â¦The Judge' dismissed the case 'on > the
ground that Keegan acted In self-defense
and further that such a small- instrument
could not be classified as a deadly weapon.

The police are satisfied that Jack Kauff
man, the one-armed beggar, who Is want
ed for t.he murder of Police. Officer Robin
son, is the man who was seen In' Victoria
last Tuesday. Kauffman was alone, and
as he was acting suspiciously Chief Lang
ley sent one of his men to arrest him. In
some way Kauffman learned that he was
being shadowed and managed to elude the
officer who was detailed to watch him. ;; ..
Last night Captain. Seymour, received
positive information that thei man seen'Mn
Victoria was Kauff man, ;the ' mendicant,
who accompanied . Woods', .feoucher' and
the rest of the murderous gang to Cypress
Lawn Cemetery on -the. night that;.thc
brave policeman was'Bhot and killed;. ".-â¢â¢
Kauff man, it is said,\.was the "lookout*'
for the gang, and after their failure to
crack the safe in the office* of the super
intendent of the cemetery he walked -, with
them to Valencia street; where they /met
Robinson and: killed him; -After the shoOt T .
ing Kauff man, it is; supposed, went, to
Seattle, and from there took, a steamship
to'Victoria. < ;i'->* : ' . . . .
Â¦ The officer who first ' aaw 'him notified
the Chief of Police, as he s was not, sure
that he was the right man. .Â« By/ the time
the Chief had arrived on the' scene" the
suspect^had eluded the officer who. was
watching him' and was supposed to. be* en
route to Vancouver. The police of 'Â¦ the
latter place were told to be on the look
out for him, ibut they failed to get a trace
of the fugitive. .. , l -v ' V,
Captain Seymour is satisfied that' the
man who was seen in Victoria is the"
much wanted .murderer. He has sent a
complete description of him to the Chiefs
of Police of Victoria and Vancouver, with
instructions to do all in their power to ar
rest him. It is believed that if Kauffman
is caught he will tell all he knows about
the murder of Policeman Robinson.

dispensing charity. â¢-..:
"Dr. Smith -says that a'peculiar fact Is
that in :the. slums -of this country the
death rate is not -higher 1 than it is in. the

Extinguished Writer Is Given a
Warm Testimonial at Metro
politan Hall.
The testimonial given in honor of Her
mann Glauch. the distinguished local poet
and artist, by the German residents under
the auspices of the German-American As
sociation of California attracted a large
and cultured audience to Metropolitan
Hall last night.
Glauch's genius Is generally recognized,
not only among the German population of
the city, but throughout the entire Union.
Recent misfortunes which overtook him
prompted his friends to tender him a com
plimentary benefit, and the great response
indicates to the full the high esteem In
which he is held. â¢;
A choice musical programme was ren
dered. â¢There were addresses by Dr. Franz
Kuckein. Charles Bundschu, Wilhelm
ZImmermann and Professor Hugo H.
Schilling of the State University. Several
of Glauch's poem's were read by Clemen
tina Schnabel and Gertrude Joseph. Pro
fessor E. "Werner was organist. Several
selections were rendered by the singing
sections of the Oakland Â¦Â¦ and San Fran
cisco Turn Vereins.
GERMAN RESIDENTS
HONOR POET 'GLAUCH
A cleverly conceived proposition by
Â¦whlch certain holders of Gas and Electric
Company stock hope to unload their
wares at enhanced prices was made pub
lic yesterday. The proposition is not one,
however, likely to be favorably received
by those who are acquainted with the va
rious methods by which stocks are ma
nipulated in the interests of a few to the
disadvantage of the many.
Stockholders of the San Francisco Gas
& Electric Company have felt shaky with
reference to the future of their holdings
foi some time past, and their fears were
not allayed when President Crockett re
cently resigned his post. The effect up
on the pried of the stock was such as to
render the future of that commodity in
t!ie market one of extreme uncertainty.
But within a day or two last past stock
holders have received a letter from a
title Insurance company, which, claiming
to act as agent for mythical parties, de
signs to secure an option on stock of the
company -with a view to securing control
of a majority of the holdings wherever
situated.
According to the terms of this proposal
the trustee of the nameless person who
is reported to have deposited $50,000 in the
Bank of California for the purpose will
pay to holders for options a quarterly
dividend at the rate of $2 a year per
share, and to pay for the stock if agree
able to the holder the sum of $60 a share.
All this will be done provided 66,000 shares
shall be deposited in the Bank of Cali
fornia before April 1. In other words,
the sum of $50,000 has been deposited for
the purpose of securing control of the gas
stock, but should less than 66,000 shares
be deposited within a stipulated period
the deal is off as far as the mythical
bu>er is concerned.
Stockbrokers who discussed the scheme
yesterday are unanimous in the belief
that the proposition as outlined In the
letter to the stockholders is merely an
attempt on the part of some of the larg
est holders to boom the stock and after
running it up to a certain figure unload
upen all who will buy. They do not con
eider the offer as made to be a bona-flde
one. but on the contrary they regarÂ«d it
&s a stock jobbing scheme designed to
bolster up a constantly failing market by
inspiring confidence of the holders in its
stability. That the offer has had little
effect thus far was demonstrated yester
day at the Stock Exchange, when 200
shares of Gas and Electric was sold at
4S. an advance of 2V& on the closing price
of the previous evening. The closing bid
was 47?i and 43 asked.
There are 130,301 shares of Gas and
Electric scattered among 1300 â¢ holders.
Few of these were deposited in response
to the circular alluded to and no rush is
expected by local brokers' until the plan
is more definitely outlined. The mere fact
that a certain sum has been deposited for
certain purposes, which will be carried out
In the event that a majority of the stock
is assigned to the depositor, is not con
sidered by holders a sufficient guarantee,
and until more definite news is vouch
safed the matter in the judgment of lead
ing brokers is likely to die of inanition.
Robert L. Galley and James Roberts
were tried before a jury In Judge Dunne's
court yesterday on the charge of assault
with intent to commit robbery. The jury,
after deliberating for some time, reported
a disagreement, anu the Judge discharged
them. The defendants were accused of
attempting to rob George Dillistone on
Annie street on the night of November 2.
They had about half an hour before held
up Robert X. Clothier on* New Montgom
ery street, near Annie, and have^ yet to
be tried on that charge.
After reporting the disagreement E. L.
Marshall, tne foreman, handed the Judge
the following protest: ' ; ;: -
We, Â¦ the panel Jurors of this honorable court,
respectfully enter a protest against being hud
dled in a small cubbyhole for a Jury room.
Our deliberations cannot be kept secret, as
we are couipe'led to open the ventilators, and
as a consequence our discussions cannot help
but be hear 1 by those passing along the cor
ridor. We think our quarters should be con
demned, and Utidcr the cubic air law would
be. In the n*s.t place -we have no toilet ac
commodations. We are of the unanimous
opinion that our present quarters are unin
habitable and respectfully request your Honor
to bring the matter before the proper authori
ties in an endeavor to have these defects rem
edied at the earliest possible date.
Judge Dunne made the following reply:
I can only say, gentlemen. In reply, that I
have endeavored for the last eighteen months
to obtain proper accommodations, and I think
your statement here is a sufficient answer to
those people who have believed that my dwn
conduct was due to an obstinate feeling against
coming here at alL That is quite untrue. I
have at all times been ready to come here
to this building if they would give me the
proper accommodations. The jury is entitled
to the same accommodations as the District
Attorney or the conrt. They occupy the same
position as the court in a way. since they are
the -judges of the facts in every criminal case,
and their position and jurisdiction, so to speak.
Is co-ordinate, and that being the case they
are entitled to proper accommodations. For
such accommodations I have insisted, but it
appears that a higher power has overridden
me and has compelled us to accept insufficient
and inadequate quarters. I am glad you have
seen fit to make this protest, as I think it
may be followed by a correction of the abuse,
or at" least I hope so: I trust, however, gen
tlemen, that no want of accommodations will
prevent us from doing our whole duty.
The case of Quinn versus Baehr, in
which it was sought to restrain the Aud
itor from drawing and auditing salary de
mands for Powel Fredrick and his depu
ties of. the clerical force in the Justices'
Court, was argued in Superior Judge
Cook's court yesterday morning on de
fendant's demurrer. Judge Cook took the
matter under advisement and will render
his decision to-day. â¢
Judge Cook will, it.- is believed, decide
whether Fredrick is de facto chief clem
of the Justices' Court ana hence entitled
to the .salary of the office,' tnuugh tne de
fendant entered the pxea that the plaintiff
was'not entitled to uring action ana that
therefore the temporary injunction should
be quashed. He may also decide whether
Fredrick is legally appointed chief cierKâ
entitled to hold office until the supervisors
shall elect a chief clerk to fill out the un
expired term. â¢ ' "
A. Ruef appeared as associate counsel
for Auditor Baehr, W. H. Cobb, Baehr'a
attorney, being present in court but not
participating in the argument. Thomas D.
itiordan appeared lor Quinn, who is a
clerk in Riordan's office.
Ruef opened his argument with . the
technical objections to the suit. He con
tended Lrst that the plain- u had no cause
for action, since as a. taxpayer his inter
ests were not directly concerned. If the
Auditor should choose to recognize Fred
rick's right to the salary he would not
recognize Windrow's claim. The courts
would recognize one or the other as the
de facto chief clerk, and one salary, would,
be paid. If Baehr should audit the illegal
claim he would be responsible to the other
claimant. In either case but one salary
would be paid, and the taxpayer, Qulnn,
would not have his of taxes in
creased in the least, nor would other of
his personal or property rights be affected.
Duty Only to Audit.
Ruef made the further point- that the
duty of drawing demands was not im
posed upon the Auditor, his duty being
simply to audit demands, and since the
petition for the injunction asked that
Baehr be restrained from "drawing the
demand" such injunction would not re
strain the Auditor from auditing Fred
rick's demand drawn by some official oth
er than the Auditor. In support of fiis
first contention Ruef cited 4ij California,
171. and 75 California, 517. ,
Judge Cook asked that Riordan be
heard on these technical points before
Ruef should proceed. Riordan cited the
decision of the Supreme Court in Morton
vs. Broderick, the famous Supervisors'
case, in which it was held that the court
has a right to decide upon the title to tho
office, which Ruef had denied in his open
ing statement. Judge Cook said. he had
asked for argument upon the two techni
cal points advancedâ that Quinn had no
cause for action and that the petition
asked for an injunction restraining the
Auditor, from doing something not im
posed upon him by law, namely, the draw
ing of a demand.
... As to that last Point," said Riordan,
It seems to me the difference merely be
twixt tweedle-dum and tw?edle-dee.
Drawing the demand does not mean the
mere clerical work involved, but passing
upon the claim and approving it."
As to the second point. Riordan argued
that in the case of Winn vs. Shaw, 87 Cal
ifornia, the Supreme Court had decided
that a taxpayer could bring action to re
strain illegal payment of money from the
treasury:* â¢ Â¦ '-- ..-.,Â¦.,,.Â¦'..,.,..*. Â£
Windrow No "Color of Authority."
Judge Cook stopped further argument
upon these points and told Kuef to pro
ceed. Kuef argued as follows:
It is admitted by plaintiff that Williams has
no title to the ottlce. The contention then u
between Fredrick and Windrow. The question
arises has Windrow any "color of authority"
for being the de facto chief clerk? Windrow,
it is claimed, was "elected- by the Justices of
the Peace under the section of the charter
which your Honor in his instructions to the
Grand Jury held to be invalid. .
Granting that the charter provision is valid
and that the Justices had the power of orig
inal appointment. Windrow's appointment was
illegal, since -nowhere - are the Justices given
power to fill a vacancy In that office. If the
office is a charter ofnee, the Mayor is given
power to fill the vacancy.
Under your opinion to the Grand Jury, your
Honor,' Windrow cannot possibly figure in this
case, and 'filings with him are not legal
My contention is that Fredrick is not only
the de facto but the de Jure chief clerk as
well. The Mayor' is given power to fill va
cancies and while this office is created by the
Btate law, it is municipal in functions and its
powers can be established by charter.
The law abhors a vacuum, ' as nature ! does,
and courts invariably hold that one contest
ant holds the office de lacto. Now the whole
time except one day Involved in this suit was
prior to Windrow's alleged election. Fredrick
performed the \ duties of the office.- and after
two days Williams ceased to appear or Mb pre
tend-to perform the duties of the office. Since
Fredrick preceded Windrow as.the.de facto
chief clerk Windrow could not become de*facto
chief clerk. ' â¢ . : .
â¢. Until such time as the Supervisors may act
pn the Justices' recommendation and 5 elect
Windrow there can be no question as to-Fred
rick's right to the salary. If the Supervisors
should take such action, then it would become
a direct issue between Fredrick and Windrow.
Riordan said- that his case was based
upon the law, aa stated by Judge Cook in
his instruction to the Grand Jury, which
practically all of the bar except Mr. Ruef
thought was good "law.
"His Honor's opinion would throw your
case out of court," retorted Ruef.
Riordan continued:
Mayor's Use of Police.
Fredrick did not take office under the
Mayor's appointment, but by force. , N'otwitli
standing' the Mayor's expressions as to usur
pation of power by the. police during Â¦ the re
cent strike, he eent nine burly policemen in to
take forcible possession of this office. Fred
rick is ' not de facto chief clerk, but a bare,
naked trespasser.
Granted that there was a vacancy, we deny
the Mayor' 8 power to appoint. His power ex
tends only to municipal officers "not otherwise
provided for In: this charter or by. law.!'. If
his power were not limited' In these appolnt
.ments he could make, a clean sweep in any
municipal office, such as the Tax j Collectors
office, removing * "for i cause" and appointing
men to his own liking. Such, indeed, has been
declared to be the Mayor's Intention. We have
heard much of Fhelanlsm, but Schmltzlsm is
going many tlmea further.
Riordan asserted in conclusion that the
Supreme Court had decided in Crowley vs.
Freud that the Justices of the Peace and
their clerks were county, not/ municipal
officers, since they were named in the
pleadings and by implication included in
the decision. .
Ruef, In his closing argument, said that
Fredrick had not taken by
force, but had forcibly held the office for,
one day against armed intrusion. â¢Â¦â¢ , s 'â¢

At a meeting of the alumni of Syracuse University
last week Governor Odell of New York was nomi
nated for president cf the United States, and now
there can be no further, complaint that university men
are not aggressive enough in politics.
An investigation is being made in Chicago to de
termine if possible if a man over 45 years of age is too
old to work. It would not take long probably to
discover that in the Windy City there are many men
tinder that age who feel that they are too strong to
work.
Professor .Tyler of Amherst is reported to be lec
turing in the East on "The Clam," which he says is
one of the finest examples in nature of comfort and
repose, and yet the professor, would not like to be a
clam; he would not even like to keep his mouth shut
and give us repose.
New York reports of a reception given to Carnegie
by the Stevens Institute of Technology, to which he
recently gave $65,000, are to the effect that he
said in his address he used to believe a man could
not possibly spend $125 a month; then he drank
toasts to the President an'd the leading professors
of the institute, led in the cheeringâfor others, and
in a loud, clear voice started singing a song. Evi
dently the gifted giver of many millions will end by
touring the country as a vaudeville star.

CONGRESS has been asked to appropriate
nearly $200,000,000 for the, construction of. a
canal at-, Nicaragua, and Senator . Scott of
West Virginia stated in the Senate the other day that
fully one-fourth of that amount has been already .ex
pended in the various efforts made to determine the
best route for constructing an isthmian canal. v It
would. seem, then,, that considerations of economy
would induce Congress to take action at this session
and expend no more good money on. investigations.
However, it is the unexpected that sometimes hap
pens. _A resolution providing for the appointment of
a commission to examine the Darieh route, or as it'
is now called, the San Bias or Mandingo Bay route,
has been referred to the Senate Committee on Inter-,
oceanic Canals. The new route has strong backing,
and, if the contest between Panama and Nicaragua
should, develop a deadlock it is almost certain the
San Bias route would receive' at least the honor: of
an investigation by experts and a report to Congress.
The amount of money expended for investigations
would be :thus raised considerably, and perhaps; . it
might be made to approach one-third of the. sum re
quired 'to build even the costliest of the proposed
waterways. '. , -*Â¦; _" : ' , ; . ; Â¦ Hi'.S- -Â¦Â¦:;.]

In the course of his explanation the Minister said:
"The- Chinese in America celebrate New Year's'day
a day ahead of the proper time of bbs#rvance. To
day is New Year eve, and to-morrow the proper day.
Do you know why to-day, is celebrated in the
'Chinatowns' throughout the United States? It is
because they don't know anything about geography
or philosophy. The pioneers among the Chinese
in America' were coolies who came here to work; as
laborers/They started from China on the first day
of the third moon. They countedone, two, three and
so on, paying no attention to the fact that at the one
hundred and eightieth meridian they lost one day.

them to this country made the same mistake. When

a day ahead for many year s, and '_ why
Since variety is the spice of life it would seem that
a man so versatile and seemingly so popular in the
East would be always happy and cheery. Unfortu
nately, in this world there is no happiness even for
lightning change artists. Minister Wu has his
troubles. On Februarys he received in Washington
a good many congratulations upon the occasion of
Chinese New Year. Minister Wu was obliged to
explain that the new year did not begin on that day,
that the celebration by the Chinese in this country is
all wrong, that he has remonstrated in vain, and that
he is disgusted with his countrymen.
MINISTER .WU continues to show the variety
of his talents to the enraptured East. He
turns lightly from the seclusion of his
august office to go to the committee-rooms of Con
gress and share in the toil of the lobby against the
exclusion bill, and then, unwearied, passes along to
make a speech to ari American audience . on^'some
great occasion of national import. It was but a little
while ago he was conspicuous about the Capitol, but

A glance at the fluctuations will reveal the serious
handicap of commerce when compelled to do busi

would buy an American dollar in Mexico. It was
nearly two for one, but if it had stood still at that
ratio the buyer and seller could have made stable cal
culations in his business. But it is not in his power
to make the ratio stand. By last November an Amer
ican dollar was worth $2 34 Mexican, and there were
fears that Mexican silver would slump entirely to its
bullion value.
MEXICAN merchants are weary of chasing the
price of exchange up and down the fluctua
tions of sifter. They buy for gold abroad
and sell for silver at home, and buy for silver at
home and sell for gold abroad. The permutations of
value seriously affect their trade and exchange.
GOLD STANDARD FOR MEXICO.
The treaty by its 'terms is limited to five years, j No
one can foresee what the intervening time will bring
forth, and it is useless; to speculate concerning what
may happen. It may be set. down as assured, how
ever, that the^ advance of Russia in Manchuria will go
surely, even if slowly, on. The fate 1 of China in the
long run will depend upon the Chinese themselves.
If under the energetic direction of the wonderful old
woman who now controls the Government they set
about fitting themselves for the protection of their
territory and their independence, they will have ho
need of such protection as the 'British and Japanese
alliance offers them. If they fail to do that the al
liance, while it may delay Russia's advance, cannot
prevent its triumph in the end.- .
The treaty is unquestionably beneficial to Great
Britain. Jt provides her with a strong ally to pro
tect her interests in the Orient should she be involved
in a war with any great European country. As the
situation stands the alliance, is the dominant factor, in
Oriental politics, nor does it seem practicable for any
other alliance to be formed strong enough to' defy
it so long as the United States; keeps out of the "con
troversy. Â¦ Nothing that Russia can' do in c6mbina
tion with France or . with Germany could make a
showing on the far-off coast- of China, or Korea of
anything like equal force to that which the navy of
Great Britain and the army of japan could make.
The only probable act of retaliation would be an
aggressive "movement by Russia on England's Indian
frontier. This would be possible and dangerous, be
cause Russia's continental position protects her,
against attack. For the present, then, the Oriental
problem may be said to have been settled.
. Such an agreement leaves a large, opening for
either of the allies to interfere in China or Korea at
will, notwithstanding, the disclaimer of any aggressive
tendencies. Each retains, the right to 'act whenever
it believes its interests to be threatened, and the
other agrees to support that right against any third
party. The extent to which the support shall be car
ried is defined in the second and the third articles
of the treaty. By the one it is provided that if either
Great Britain or Japan be involved in war the other
will maintain strict neutrality and use its efforts to
prevent other powers from joining in hostilities
against its ally, while the third article provides that
should any other power make war against that ally
the other contracting party will come to the assist
ance of its ally and will conduct war in common with
it and make peace in mutual agreement with it.
The treaty begins by a declaration that the con
tracting parties are uninfluenced by. any aggressive
tendencies in either China or Korea, but goes on to
say that, recognizing that the interests of Great Brit
ain are mainly in China while those of Japan are in
Korea, it is agreed that "it will be admissible for
either of them to take such ' measures as may be in
dispensable in order to safeguard those interests if
they be threatened either by the aggressive actionof
any other power or by disturbances arising in China
or in Korea."
FOR the purpose of maintaining their interests in
the Orient'Great Britain and Japan have en
tered into an alliance which binds, them under
certain conditions, to* make joint war against a foe of
either. It is a treaty which promises to settle - the
Oriental question for a time at least by assuring the
territorial integrity .and political' independence of
China and Korea. - To that extent the treaty would
serve our interests as well as those of the allies, and
if that were all it would, doubtless .be received here
with almost as much 'f aver as in Great Britain -itself.
A careful reading of the treaty, however, shows that
it may mean something more than the preservation
of the existing situation,' and accordingly all nations
having interests in the Orient will have to watch the
new alliance with considerable care.

Is this a reaction from a supreme effort, or is it
evidence that the Cuban aspiration for self-govern
ment was a fable, the revolution an insurrection of
marauders and our part in the affair deserving of the
booby prize?*
After resting on their guns they renewed the fight
with such vim and vigor that Spain was driven to the
end of her resources in resisting. The Cubans de
vised a flag and a junta. The junta headquartered in
New York and the flag was *in all our windows
haloed by the legend, "Cuba libre." They supplied
this country with heroics and shesterics; and Miss
Cisneros and a job lot of Arnold Winkelreids, Joan
of Arcs, Moll Pitchers and Molly Starks. We car
ried our weep-weakened eyes to the oculist, and the
salty tears from pity's sweet fountain as they flowed
left a deposit on the national face like that deposited
by the waters of Shasta soda spring. We spent blood
and treasure to give them the ballot, and the first
time they have a chance to use it they snub the. polls
as indifferently as a Front-street merchant does his
party's primary.
Why La Republica does not deal with the equally
serious question of the indifference that has come over
the people is not explained. They fought ten years
steadily for the right to govern themselves by the
ballot, and bit their thumbs at us because President
Grant refused to interfere and help them to the lux
ury of registry and returning boards.
It is 2 condition that may well be remembered
when the exploiters and speculators get their pro
gramme of annexation ready for a plebiscite by the
islanders, as they will before long. The "returning
boards will attend to that, whether a majority vote
against it or whether no one votes at all. If our
lap is ready Cuba will sit down in it without regard
to the will of her people. A returning board that can
swell an actual vote of 7000 out of a -registration of
35,000 to a total of 45,000 will see*to it that annexa
tion has a majority so large as to impress our senti
mental people. ., '
Shall fall into the ballot-box, and thereafter they pro
ceed to revise the freeman's will and beautify the re
sult. But it seems that the Cuban artists are faith
cure folk. They give the result absent treatment, not
requiring the presence of the ballot at all. The
voters may save the time required to visit the polls. Â¦â¢'
These official mind-readers will attend to everything.
The voter need not even touch the button in order
for them to do the rest.
it must be -said for our criminal countrymen who do
slick work with the ballots that in their rude, un
tutored hearts they, after a fashion, respect the sanc
tity of the ballot-box and insist that the ballot'
Which falls as light
As snowflake on the sod,
But executes the freeman's will.
As lightning does the will of God,
The newspaper exhausts itself in demonstrating the
iniquity of the returning board. Admitting its state
ment of facts/that iniquity is great. If that board
padded 7000 votes cast into 45,000, and allotted them*
to candidates as it pleased, which of course would
follow, it has nothing to learn from Tammany or of
the Pilgrim Band in Philadelphia. At the worst
those experts get the ballots into the box by judi
cious stuffing, repeating .and impersonation of law
ful voters by others. They also miscall -and mistally
to candidates votes that were cast against them. But
LA REPUBLICA, an organ of revolution > and
independence in Havana, soberly questions the
declared result of the recent election for the
organic officers of the new republic. It has required
twenty-eight'days for the returning board of the
province of Havana to tabulate the tally sheets and
declare officially the result of the election. Its final
return shows that '55,486 voters went to the polls in
that, province. This is disputed by La Republica,
which declares that not over 7000 voted in the city
of Havana and the same indifference existed through
out the province. It also, shows that the registry of
voters in the whole province was.,75,000, of which
on ly 35.OOO were registered in the city of Havana,
yet the board returns 45,000 votes as cast in Havana,
or io.goo in excess, of the registration and the exhibit
of the census.

No" visitors called at the school during
the day. This evening Professor Jackson
of the faculty called at the Powell cot
tage and assured the newspaper men that
the patient was holding his own, confirm
ing earlier reports by saying that his
pulse, resniration' and 'temperature were
normal. The indications also were for a
good night. . Â¦ '
Mrs. Roosevelt kept indoors nearly all
day. her only taste of the cool, bracing
air being during her walk from the Gard
ner house to - the infirmary. She has
borne up well under the strain. She will
be relieved somewhat during the next few
days by Miss Alice Roosevelt, who. the
President had said, would leave Washing
ton to-morrow for Groton. He also said"
that Mrs. Roosevelt hoped to remove
Theodore Jr. to the White House within
ten days, adding that the boy would re
turn to Groton to complete his course as
soon as his health would permit.
Before lunch he called on the other pa
tients, the Gammell and Potter boys, and
cheered them up with his kindly greet
ings. Then he proceeded to the Powell
cottage and held a brief interview with
the newspaper men who had that place
for their headquarters. The President
feelingly thanked them for a gift of flow-,
ers to Mrs. Roosevelt and for their cour
tesy to him and his family during the
trying days that have so happily ended.
The remainder of his stay was with Mrs.
Roosevelt and 'his son. At 4:15 p. m. the
President, accompanied by Secretary Cor
telyou, Barnes, the executive clerk; Prin
cipal Peabody of the school and two secret
service officers, left in a carriage for
Groton village station. A special train
was in readiness there to take the party
to Worcester. Many persons had gathered
at the station and in response to their
cheers the President doffed his hat. He
also bade farewell to the newspaper men
grouped at his platform. At 4:30 the
train left. _ -
The President passed a quiet day. This
morning after visiting his son he spent
most of his time at the Gardner mansion,
transacting official business.
Later in the day Dr. "Warren stated that
the patient's temperature, respiration and
pulse were normal, a decided contrast to
his condition the past few days. The. boy
rested well all day, although his pulse
was somewhat accelerated for a short
period this afternoon because of the de
parture of his father.
! The day was full of happiness 'for the
President and Mrs. Roosevelt, and indeed
for all who were at the infirmary or near
the school grounds.. The first report from
â¢the bedside of young Roosevelt showed
that he had passed a good night. After
the morning consultation of Drs. Lam
bert and "Warren it was announced that
the boy's condition was progressing favor
ably. - The report, said that the lungs were
clearing well, although the patient was
still in the second stage of pleuro-pneu
monia, known to medical men as the
stage of exudation. >
GROTON, Mass., Feb. 13.â The most

ance insures peace and .will effectually

SENSATION AT PEKING.
CALL BUREAU 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â That an
occasion may not immediately arise for
the application of the Anglo- Japanese
treaty the representatives of the powers
In Peking have been instructed to urge
the signature by China of the evacuation
convention negotiated with Russia. This
convention was negotiated with the
Russo-Chinese Bank arrangement, the
negotiation of which is believed to have
been one of the important causes of the
conclusion . of the treaty of alliance be
tween Great Britain and Japan. This
arrangement Is strongly opposed by the
United States and will not be signed, ac
cording to the Japanese, unless Russia
is prepared to engage in war with them,
and in case of assistance being rendered
by France, with Great Britain. â¢
In some quarters It is generally be
lieved that Russia will withdraw her
support from an arrangement considered
so objectionable. Whether she will at the
same time abandon her effort to obtain
tne signature of the evacuation conven
tion is a question which the authorities
are. somewhat concerned about.
Awaits March of Events.
When the Russian Government found
opposition on the part of the powers last
spring to the agreement with China, it
abandoned negotiations and stated that
while maintaining the existing temporary
situation In Manchuria in order to pre
serve peace throughout the vast territory
adjoining her" frontier, and following out
with absolute fidelity its original inten
tions, "the imperial Government is con
tent to await calmly ,the march of
events." Should the Russo-Chinese Bank
arrangement fail, Russia will be in a
position to refer to her declaration that
she would withdraw her troops "provided
the action of other powers shall not
stand in the way," and remain in pos
session of Manchuria-
Whether Great Britain and Japan will
be disposed to permit Russia to remain
can be determined only by themselves.
In view of the publication. of their treaty
of alliance, which in itself is regarded
here as an ultimatum to Russia, it is not
believed they can with dignity permit the
Muscovite Government to remain -with
out some definite assurances as to tTie
time of evacuation.
As Explained by Japan.
The Japanese Minister, Mr. Takahira,
has received the following cablegram
from Tokio: >
The Anglo- Japanese agreement was an
nounced on the 12th inst. ''in the House of
Peer? by General Viscount Katsura, Minister-
President, and in the House of Representatives
by Mr. Komura, Minister for Foreign Affairs,
with the following explanations:
In view of the actual situation in the Far
East and the interests- of the empire Involved
therein, and recognizing the desirability of
establishing close and confidential relations
with friendly powers having common interests
with our own country, the imperial Government
entered into negotiations with the British Gov
ernment last year for the purpose of attaining
that end. The two Governments, having been
happily brought into complete accord upon the
subject after extended negotiations and the
imperial Government having obtained his
Majesty's sanction, instructed their plenipo
tentiary to sign with the British plenipoten
tiary at London on the 30th of January last
an agreement having the above objects in
view.
This agreement Is entirely pacific in pur
pose and has no other object than the proper
safeguarding of the Interests of the neighbor
ing empires of China and Korea.
Considering that the principles of territorial
integrity and the open door have been volun
tarily declared and approved by all of the
powers concerned It is our belief that the
present agreement will not be regarded In an
unfavorable light by any of the powers
It was stated at the Russian embassy
that the purposes set forth in the Brit
ish-Japanese agreement as to the pres
ervation of the integrity of the Chinese
empire are in harmony with those of tfie
Russian Government, which has consist
ently contended for that principle.
Substance of Agreement Communi-
UNCLE SAM IS INFORMED.
cated Before Publication.
LONDON, Feb. 13.-The Parliamentary
Secretary of Foreign Affafc-s, Lord Cran
borne, replying in the House of Commons
to-day to Henry Norman (Liberal), who
asked whether the Anglo-Japanese treaty
of alliance was communicated to the
United States Government before its text
was published and if so whether the GovÂ«
ernment of the United States expressed
an opinion thereon, said the substance of
the agreement was communicated to the
United States Government before pub-,
llcatlon. The United States did not ex.
press any opinion on the subject. Lord
Cranborne added the information that
Manchuria was no more excluded from
the terms of the agreement than j any
other province of the Chinese empire
The substance of the agreement. Lord
Cranborne said, was also communicated
to Germany.
Norman subsequently moved an ad
journment in order to discuss the treaty.
Norman said he objected to the - Anglo-
Japanese treaty on the ground that it was
fwWl? an antl-Russlan threat and that
it tied Great Britain to the whole of the
Japanese policy in such a'way that, she
fa^wnVteresfs.' 0 S Â° to â¢r . against
_ Lord Cranborne explained that the con
trading parties were only bound to un
dertake mutual defense of their interests
So far as the treaty concerned the in
tegrity of China, Manchuria must be ta
ken as forming part of the Chinese Em
pire. The purposes ofi the alliance were
threefoldâ the maintenance of the status
quo, the policy of the open door and the
maintenance of peace in the Far East. No
other power's interests In the Far East
were at all comparable with those of
Great Britain and Japan. While It was
true that alliances of Great Britain with
other powers had been regarded hereto
fore with suspicion, he, frankly declared
that the Government was not going to be
deterred by these considerations or admit
that because an agreement involved that
departure from the policy of isolation it
was therefore open- to adverse criticism.
They saw on all sides a tendency of the
great, powers to form groups and ever
increasing burdens on the people. In
these days Â¦ wars broke out with a sud
denness which was not the case in for
mer years. So the country adopting with
out reservation the doctrine that all alli
ances must be avoided must be endowed
with extraordinary self-sufficiency. Brit
ons must not be swayed by old-fashioned
suspicion In regard to isolation, but must
consider whether the objects of the alli
ance are commendable; whether the price
is too great. If these questions were sat
isfactorily answered, then the alliance was
a good thing. There was much greater
danger in leaving great questions of in
ternational policy to a vague, hasty un
derstanding than in embodying them ex
plicitly in an -agreement, the purpose of
which can be understood. Great Britain
desired to protect Japan against what
she conceived to be the gravest peril that
might menace her, namely, a coalition of
the powers against her. The agreement
would compel Great Britain to come to
the rescue of a friendly country whose
obliteration by a coalition of the powers
Great Britain could not under any cir
cumstances tolerate. .The treaty was not
connected with the Government's decision
regarding Wei-Hal-Wei.:. The mainte
nance of the independence of Japan and
the protection of Korea were of the ut
most importance to Great Britain as well
as Japan. I . ,
Lord Rosebery , expressed general ap
provalof the treaty.. He said the effect
of the treaty wo.uld be felt in a great part
of Europe and in the rest of the civilized
world. - Â¦ . â¢ .
The Foreign Secretary, . Lord . Lans
(Jowne, in the House of Lords, made' a
somewhat similar reply on the effect of
the new dual alliance to the one made in
the House of Commons by Lord Cran
borne. Lord Lansdowne added that noth
ing in the agreement did violence to ths
accepted policy of the other powers. '
Explained to the Lords.
This statement was received with
cheers.
Lord Cranborne said in> conclusion that
he would supplement his? earlier state
ment regarding the United States by say
ir.g: "Throughout all the doings In China
the relations between Great Britain ani
the United States were marked by the
greatest cordiality.. At almost every
crisis and in the case of every small dif
ficulty which had arisen during the nego
tions at Peking the United States and
British representatives had always acted
together. There Is no doubt that in this
agreement we shall command the full ap
proval of the Government of the United
States." *
The treaty was not unfriendly to other
nations. It would, Balfour said, have a
sobering effect on the continental -schools
of thought, which imperiled the world's
peace. An interchange of notes would
have resulted in ambiguity.
Continuing, Lord Cranborne said Russia
had recognized Japan's special position in
Korea by "the agreement of 1898 and al
most every power had indorsed the prin
ciple of the "open door" and the terri
torial integrity of China. The new treaty,
therefore, was merely along lines already
accepted by almost every power. Great
Britain's commercial position in China
was of the greatest importance and who
could say what its importance would be
come in the future, with China's infinite
capacity for expansion? Great Britain's
commercial position, though great, was
not unchallenged. Spheres of influence
did not suit her. She wanted the whole
of China open to industrial enterprise.
The Government was bound to take every
care in safeguarding its ' commercial
rights in the Orient. -Japan's special in
terest was governed by her geographical
position. Her army and Great Britain's
navy were acting in concert and were pe
culiarly able to maintain the foregoing
policy. i . . ;
The Government leader, A. J. Balfour,.
said there seemed to be an impression that
something hostile to peace was behind the
agreement. That was not.so. The- treaty
was not based on secret information of
impending dangers, but on the broad facts
of British interests. The treaty made
strongly for peace, because even the most
adventurous nation would shrink from at
tacking Japan with the knowledge that
Great Britain would also have to be en
countered.
Treaty Is for Peace.
when the danger was due to the aggres
sion of others and the power called upon
to help the other must judge whether the
conditions of the treaty have been ob
served. â¢
The Liberal leader, Sir Henry Campbell-
Bannerman, thought the identical inter
ests of Great Britain, the United States
and Japan could have been sufficiently se
cured by an interchange of notes instead
of by an explicit undertaking of this
kind. : , i

AN EXTErAOBDINABY FACT.
Britain Abandons Isolation Policy
YOKOHAMA, Feb. 13.â The press here
gives vent to unmixed pleasure at the con
clusion of the agreement with Great
Britain which secured for Japan admis
sion to the comity of great nations. The
Press also recognizes that the agreement
imposes heavy responsibilites and â¢ that
Japan must not fall the error of
supposing that peace will be assured with
out further effort.
Several of the papers comment upon the
extraordinary fact > that the leading world
power abandons its polity, of . Isolation
openly to clasp hands with Japan. The
Nichinichi Shimbun says that the union
of the strongest military power in the
East with the greatest i naval power in
the world constitutes an invincible force.
The Ashahi Shimbun, an important pa
per of Tokio. .declares that the whole
country acclaims the agreement, which for
the .first time removes Korea beyond the
dangerous contingencies involved in the
evidences of Russia's willingness to sacri
fice that country upon the altar of her
great ambition.
RUSSIA WILL LIB LOW.
Austrian Comment on the Nevr Far
East Alliance.
VIENNA, Feb. 13.â The Anglo- Japanese
treaty of alliance is the feature of to
day's news in the Austrian newspapers
and Russia's probable action is widely
discussed. The consensus of opinion
among those who are generally in touch
with Russian views Js that the militant
Muscovites will endeavor to revenge them
selves by stirring up disorders In Afghan
istan, while the Russian Government will
lie low, awaiting the moment when Japan,
having organized the military forces of
China, will join hands with the latter and
drive put all Europeans with the excep
tion of the Russians, who, by that time,
will occupy an impregnable position in
Manchuria.
Sorne of the papers affect to see in the
publication of the treaty at the time when
Admiral Prince Henry of Prussia is start
ing f for the United States, "Great Brit
tuS-^ty wÂ° J < S erman ? r ' s rapprochment
with the United States."
SHEBIFFS GETTDTG BEADY
TO HUNT DOWN" BANDITS
Will Wage a War of Extermination
Against the Musgrove Band
of Outlaws.
EL PASO, Tex., Feb. 13.â Pursuant to
instructions from Governor Otero of New
Mexico the Sheriffs of Guadalupe, Union,
Lincoln and Chaves counties are organiz
ing posses of picked men to hunt down
the members of the Jack Musgrove band
of bandits which has recently terrorized
that region. This means that a war of
extermination will be waged against the
outlaws and exciting times are expected
in that portion of New Mexico to -which
the outlaws have retreated. At present
they are said to.be in the fastnesses ot
the Wild Capitan Mountains, reveling in
fancied security. The Governor addressed
a strong letter to the Sheriffs of the four
counties mentioned, urging them to "end
the reign of terror in the isolated settle
ments of Eastern New Mexico; caused by
the murdering and pillaging outlaws."
and promising that he will recommend to
the next Legislature that rewards be
given those who are instrumental in cap
turing and convicting the brigands.

Choiceâ A Few Remarks
- About Piano Prices and
What Can Be Accomplished
Now. _ i Â¦
If you anticipate the purchase
of a fine Piano within the next
twelve months you should not
fail to hustle around to 653 Mar-
ket street (opposite the Lotta
Fountain) and select choice of
a { "new scale" Kimball Piano
during this closing' out sale of
the Eilers Piano Company whole-
sale stock, which began last
Monday morning.
One hundred and seventy-five
dollars, and in some cases as
â¢much as two hundred and fifty
dollars, can actually be saved in
purchasing a Piano at this sale.
The difference between retail
price of a fine Piano and its ac-
tual wholesale or factory cost is
of necessity enormous â in most
cases nearly, one-half â and this
difference can actually be saved
now by every person who deals
here.
At this sale can be had for
$136 a Piano that retails every-
; where else for no less than $250.
i At this sale can be had a New
Scale Kimball Upright Piano, in
! fancy mottled English walnut,
quarter-sawed oak, or selected
San Domingo mahogany case, a
strictly modern and up to-date
Piano, possessing every \'aluable
improvement found only in the
most costly American Piano-
fortes, and having numerous ex-
clusive features that are the ex-
clusive property of the manufac-
turers of the Kimball Piano, and
cannot therefore be found in any
other make. We will sell you
such a Piano for virtually one-
half of the amount you would be
expected to pay for an instru-
ment of similar grade and value
elsewhere.
Twenty-five dollars down and
$10 a month will secure any in-
strument in stock, excepting
three very elaborately hand-
carved styles, the factory cost of
which exceeds $350, and on
which payments cannot be ac-
cepted less than $50 down and
$20 a month. As all prices are
based, on the cash cost of the in-
struments, those taking advan-
tage of our easy payment plan
will pay interest at the rate of 8
per cent per annum on deferred
payments.

HER VALUE INCREASED.
NORBICA'S EUROPEAN SUCCESS
" HAS DOUBLED HER
PBICES. ,
The financial value that accompanies
artistic success is again illustrated In tha
case of Nordlca. the great soprano, whose
triumphs at Beyreuth were heralded far.
and . near. Before her overwhelming:
European success, managers estimated ber
services at $600 for each performance,
but the contract for this season calls for
$1200 per night for fifty nights. Sixty
thousand dollars as against thirty thou-
sand is a handsome increase. Her hormw
in London Is a beautiful example of taata*
and refinement. Chlcagoans will be inter-
ested In knowing that she has a Kimball
piano in her studio.- which she constantly
uses because, as she^says, it is perfect for
accompanying the voice. â Chicago Inter

a communication yesterday with the
Board of Supervisors In which he criti
cized the petition of the protestanta
against the extension of the pound limits
by amending the so-called "two cow or
dinance. Roundey asserts that the slp
ers are clam diggers, florists, market
gardeners, dairymen, ex-dairymen and
children, all of whom are directly inter
ested in excluding the districts in which
they reside from the pound limits so they
may be able to use the public streets.

RECEIPTS
ThÂ« feature of the stock market yesterday
morning,' and one which aroused the liveliest
interest on the street, was the issuance of a
circular to the stockholders of the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company by the Cali
fornia Title . Insurance and Trust Company. In
which the latter corporation announced that It
has been appointed trustee for the purpose of
securing options on the stock of the Gas and
Electric Company.* In the language of the cir
cular, "The persona. whom the California Title
and Trust Company represents are prepared to
pay, as a' consideration for the option sought,
quarterly dividends at the rate of $2 per share
per year, and to pay for the stock. If the op
tions are called. $60 per share. In furtherance
of the above, we beg to inform you that the
sum of $50,000 has been deposited with the
Bank of California to provide for the first
quarterly payment of 50c 'per share, provided
that unless 66.000 shares shall be deposited
before April 1. 1902. the California" Title and
Trust Company shall have the right of with
drawing the money deposited. No control of
the stock deposited will be acquired by this
company or the persons for whom It is act
ing. . unless the purchase price be paid. Re
ceipts will be Issued by the Bank of California,
which will b*. negotiable."
Stockholders are requested to sign an ln
closed option and forward It to the Trust Com
pany and deposit their stock with the Bank
of California.
This circular caused a flurry in the stock,
which advanced to $50 and fell back to $43,
as agatnst $45 25 as the closing price of tho
preceding day. Nobody seemed to know what
was in the wind, and the brokers were agx>,r
over the matter.
Otherwise there was nothing new In the mar
ket, though a very fair business was done in
the other stocks. There was Increased trad-
Ing. In /the oil stocks, as will' be seen below.

"Fruits â Inquiries for California fruits arc
more numerous, and a fair amount of business
Is being done at improving prices. A good
Epring demand is expected."
"In Liverpool the inquiry still continues good.
Alaska has advanced 3d to Cd per case, and
choice qualities are in very Fhort supply and
If. big demand. Half-paund salmon is especially
firm.
"Salmon â The cood consumtive demand for
both Alaska' ar.d Fraser River salmon has con
siderably depleted stocks on the ppot, and conse
quently pr-iees for both descriptions have been
firrat r during the week. With arrivals of the
1U01 pack BtUI a long way ahead, the position
of the niatket apjiears to be a strong one. but
<<ii the <nlier hand any big advance would speed
ily result in supines being brought to this
ccontry overland. While the Alaska and Brtt
iFti Columbia associations ha*.*Â«Â» apparently re
solved r.ot to overload this country, it is quite
apparent that it would be to their disadvantage
to al!"W prices to be forced up to such a level
that the consumption would be checked.

where considerable advances had occurred. The
buying and bidding up of other stocks to make
fresh points of strength to cover the realizing
was In evidence, but rather less effective and
was less persistently maintained, the earlier
gams being largely wiped out In the lace re.ir
tion. Th'_ local tractions were under decided
preÂ«mte, and notwithstanding the support ac
corded to them they exercised a depressing in
fluence on the rest of the market. The same
was true of Amalgamated Copper, which
sagged away under constant offerings without
much evidence of support, closing with a net
Ioes of 2%. There was no news to account for
the weakness. The depression of the local
tractions was, of course, due to the proposi
tion of the Brooklyn -Rapid Transit directors
to issue bonds to the extent of $150,000,000. The
argument that this abundant capital would
check the diversion of current earnings into the
betterments and extensions and would thus
hasten the period of dividend disbursements
apparently failed to reassure speculative senti
ment, and the open buying of the Etocks by
inside interests .was equally unavailing. The
news of the proposed bond issue also upset the
calculations of a coming merger of all the
Greater New York transit facilities, which has
been an Instrument in the hands of the specu
lators for some time past. The failure of the
Metroiwlitan Street Railway's new financial
plan, wheih was expected to-day, added to the
feeling of doubt and distrust, although that
stock itself was best supported of the group.
There was no apparent cause for the reaction
in prices in the news of the day, outside of
this beyond the natural disposition to sell at
a profit what had been bought at lower prices.
Reports of renewed rate-cutting among the Far
western railroads may have emphasized the
desire to sell their stocks. The reports received
of gross earnings for the first week in February
also showed a prevalent tendency to decreases
compared with last year. This was notably
true of the Southwestern railroads, but there
was marked strength in that group led by
Texas and Pacific, with a rise of 2% on inti
mation of very large earnings. There were
unusually large dealings in the Colorado and
Southern stocks, which were supposed to be
due to expectation of increased dividend dis
bureements, but the common rose an extreme
2% over Tuesday's level late in the day after
the announcement had been made of the decla

days past.
The two men had gone down the street
together, and about 9 o'clock were about
to part for the evening, when the stran
ger suddenly struck Dumont with. a piece
of gasplpe. While Dumont was lying on
the ground dazed by the blow the stran-
Etr went through. his pockets and robbed
him of about $S0 in the form of two $20
pieces, a $5 piece and some silver. ? Â¦
Csptain Seymour has detailed two de

Dumont says, is a Frenchman.

There is no attempt to prevent any proper
narty _from . seeing the company's books, for
there is. nothing to conceal. Business Man
ager Daniels has stood ready at all times to
nroduce the Isooks in court, and he also gave
a written. order to the bookkeeper to exhibit
the hooka to any stockholder, or his representa
tive provided the, books were examined in his
(tho' bookkeeper's) presence.' ;,
This- would- authorize Attorney Ach, if â¢ hÂ«
so desired, to come to the Knquirer office as
the representalve of Mr. , Collins and study thÂ«
books aa much as he pleased. The reason for
refusing to produce the books before the Court
Commissioner, or before . a notary public. Is
that there it would not be able to protect them,
and it is not proposed . to allow them to go
where they will not be protected at all times.
Nothing to Conceal.
As the refusal of the president and man
ager of the Enquirer Publishing Company to
produce the company's books at the demand
of Attorney Ach has been misrepresented in
some quarters, it may be well to give the true
state of the case. Â¦
Henry Payot will repeat his interesting

terday in the United States District Court

Various plans were discussed for an ac
tive campaign to bring about the desired
result, but no definite action was taken,
the whole matter being left for a future
meeting, which will be called by the
chair. It is expected that there will not
be any difficulty In raising the amount of
money required.

J. R. Tally was passing along Los An
geles street shortly after 10 o'clock when
he saw a crowd of men and boys around
two fighting dogs. The larger dog had a
death grip on the throat of the smaller.
Tally's sympathies were aroused, and a.
policeman, so Tally says, told him to sep-^
arate the combatants If possible. Ho
pulled the bulldog, kicked it and tried to
open its mouth, but the animal had a grip
of death upon the throat of the under
dog and refused to relinquish its hold.
Tally says the policeman told him to kill
the vicious brute, and he drew his pocket
knife and after making another effort to
pry open the brute's mouth, cut its throat.
The blood poured upon the sidewalk, but
the bulldog would not release his hold.
Tally again drew his knife across the bull
dog's neck, this time cutting deeper. The
animal suddenly released Its hold upon its
adversary and turned its attention to
Tally. He defended himself with the
knife, but the fight continued for some
time before the canine, exhausted from
the loss of blood, fell to the street, but not
until after it had succeeded In burying its
teeth in Tally's hand. During: the combat
the dog repeatedly jumped toward Tally's
throat. Tally's Injury is not serious.

The proceedings of to-day " will brine
further complications, . which will - require
the Supreme Court to unravel and decide
whether a Commlslsoner is a- Judicial of
ficer. Sheriff Rogers may refuse to issue a
warrant according to the demands of the
Court Commissioner, in which :case the
plaintiffs "will .mandamus him.': On- the
other hand the defendants may sue out a
writ of prohibition that will be taken im
mediately " to -the Supreme Court, If
Daniels Is arrested the defendant? may
sue out a writ of habeas corpus, .
.As the refusal of General Manager Dan
iels: to produce the books of the Enquirer
Publishing Company, before Court - Com-
Complications Threaten!
â¢The decision, of the Court Commissioner
was followed by a demand from Ach that
a warrant be issued for Mr. Daniels' ar
rest and that he be brought before the
court by the Sheriff, to be dealt with.ac
cording as the Commissioner In his. judg
ment deems fit. He volunteered to pre
pare the order and warrant for submis
sion to the court.
"I order Mr. Daniels' arrest," said the
Commissioner, "and wish Mr. Ach would
prepare the papers. And I wish to say
that the subpena requires -him to pro
duce certain books and papers. I, cer
tainly, if I have the power to do so, shall
compel the production of those books and
papers under that subpena.'.' ' Â¦
"I ask you Honor to find Mr. Daniels
guilty of contempt in failing to obey the
subpena," said Mr. Ach, "the evidence
showing that he has them in his posses
sion, under his control, in addition to the
other findings. I want to test this thing
test it all the way through." <
"We might as well make a dozen ar
rests." said Snook. â¢ .. , ,
"One is just as good as . a dozen," â¢ re
plied Ach. â¢ : .-,.'Â¦>
"Well, we will take steps, too," re
torted Snook. ' Â¦ - '" >"Â¦Â¦-;â¢Â¦ : - ;
"I ask your Honor to find the defendant
guilty of two-contemnta," urged .Ach.
"One is for boisterous conduct -and the
other for failing to obey the subpena.".-
The Court Commissioner finally decided
to comply with the wishes of Ach and
the attorney went off, saying he would
prepare the Â¦ necessary papers during the
night
Demands Daniels' Arrest.
On yesterday, to which time the further tak
ing of the depositions herein was continued,
the witness, O. B. Daniels, being on the stand
as a witness, and being then and there in
terrogated by the plaintiff's attorney, without
the consent of the plaintiff's attorney, ani
without the permission of the Court Commis
sioner abruptly took his hat and said "Good
day gentlemen," and left the room, where
upon the counsel for the plaintiff asked the
Commissioner to adjudge the said Daniels
guilty of contempt, under the provisions of the
I cannot say, for I do not believe, that the
eald Daniels Intended to Ignore or set at de
nance the authority of the Court Commissioner,
or treat him in any disrespectful manner, for
the reason that up to the time that he left
he had very good reason to believe from what
transpired in the Superior Court the day pre
vious, and from the arguments of counsel be
fore me, that he was under no legal restraint
whatever to answer the questions which had
been asked him. Â¦ Â¦â¢
Nevertheless, his conduct above referred to
was In contempt of judicial authority, and I
now bo decide, and find him guilty ot con
Â¦ As to the decision of Judge Ogden touching
tho proceedings for contempt before him. I
have this to say. I do not understand that Judge
Ogden decided that. I had no authority to pun
ish for contempt, but on the contrary, he said
substantially this: ....
That if any contempt had been committed.
It was before the Commissioner, and' not be
fore him and that he had no authority to take
Judicial notice of.it. : As to on whom the
hurden growing out of proceedings for con
tempt may fall, it is not proper for me to con
aider that matter.
Daniels Leaves the Room.
I have, myself, given a good deal of time
to the investigation since the question arose,
and notwithstanding the full and careful
presentation made by the attorney here, Mr.
Snook, 1 fall to reach the conclusion that I
have not the power to punish for contempt.
Just before you gentlemen came \ down here,
I had dictated an opinion, and hi reference to
the constitutional provisions in connection with
section 178 I say that these sections commenc
ing at 178, taken in connection with the pro
visions quoted from the constitution, leave no
doubt In my mind that I have full and ample
authority to punish for contempt of the au
thority vested In me as court commissioner,
and further, that I not only have that author
ity, but it is my duty, in furtherance of the
orderly conduct of the business before me, to
exercise that power â¢whenever the occasion de
mands It in the Interests of justice.
Attorney Ach's burden of contention
was diametrically opposite to that held
by Attorney Snook. He referred .to the
statutes to show that express authority
is conferred upon all judicial officers to
punish' all who dispute the judicial au
thority and refuse to obey the orders of
Buch an officer. The Court Commissioner,
he declared, Is a Judicial officer.
"The refusal of a witness to obey the
orders of a judicial officer," he said, "is
one of the specially designated cases of
contempt. Daniels refused to obey the
orders of this court. Not only that, but
he insulted this court by leaving it while
on the' witness stand. When I asked him
a question he put on his hat and said:
'Good day, gentlemen,' and walked Out.
It was as much as If he ' had said, To
Halifax with you all.'"
When the attorneys had finally con
cluded their arguments the Court Com
missioner thanked them for their labors
in the exposition of the law before him
and then said:
Attorneys Argue Point.
The attorneys spent the entire alternoon
to-day In the presentation of law before
the Commissioner. Attorney Snook, who
had first say, confined himself to argu
ments and authorities to show, that a
Court Commissioner has no more rights
than a notary public and that his pow
ers are merely ministerial, not judicial.
He contended that a Court Commissioner
by no means has the power to punish con
temptuous acts In his presence. A man
might tell the Court Commissioner to "go
to thunder," he said, and he could not
hold him responsible for it. '
Then Attorney Ach, for the plaintiff,
sprang a few statutes and law points to
show that Attorney Snook's client was in
contempt because he had left the court
room without leave and while on the wit
ness stand. Attorney Snook was unpre
pared to argue the point, offhand and
asked for time so that he could present
his views on the mooted question.
The only question involved was the
right of the Court Commissioner to ex
ercise judicial powers. Judge Ogden had
told the Commissioner when Mr. Daniels
was haled before him the other day
that he, Judge Ogden, had no jurisdiction
to punish him for his refusal to l'urnish
the books and that if he was In contempt
to anybody it was the Court Commis
sioner. So Mr. Daniels thought he could
safely ignore the commands of the Court
Commissioner and summarily left his
presence. ...
Court Commissioner Babcock held to
day that he had the power to punish of
fenders for the disobedience of his man
dates and he ordered the arrest of G. B.
Daniels, managing editor of the Oakland
Enquirer, for having refused to produce
the books of the publishing company and
for having left the presence of the Com
missioner without leave yesterday after
noon. (

Vast tracts of land which Spain never
owned, the doctor asserts, have been sold
in. Cuba, and among them the private
holdings of hundreds of residents. Hun
dreds are starving on the island, while the
United States is pouring in a flood of
labor instead of utilizing the labor at
hand, and the result is that, although
three years have elapsed since the close
of the war, Cuba has made little progress
because there is no money there.
Dr. de Peamadded that the spirit of in
ternal dissension would tear Cuba to
pieces again and that the United States
would be compelled to take hold of the
island. This was desired by the better
element, Spanish and Cuban alike, he de
clared.
"Annexation," says Dr. de Peau, "Is the
only solution of the present situation in
Cuba. Because of the tariff against Cuban
sugar the planters cannot move. They
have no money and no means of raising
any without giving from 18 to 22 per cent

Bpct. The residents of the district, so far as
I have conversed with them, favor the Bay
View Farm.
' Augustus D. Pratt, who has resided in
this district for many years, said:
Checks Growth of District.
A peculiar proposiion has been evolved In
connection with the plan to put election booths
upon the already overcrowded lot. The present
buildings afford scant space for exercise for
those who are now confined there, yet arrange
ments have been made tentatively by the Board
of Health to purchase from the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners a number of booths for the
shelter of patients. Ho* the transfer of city
moneys is to be made is an interesting sub
ject of discussion among those conversant with
city finances and we propose to find out how it
can be done.
If it is attempted to expend $1 for the re
pair of this place, we propose to expend all
the money needed to procure an injunction and
fight the matter through the highest courts of
the State. A "committee of safety" might be
organized in the district if other means failed.
We are informed that the land -upon which
the buildings are located is not owned by the
city and that any Improvements made would
revert to the owners. What they would do
with them after the place is eventually aban
doned is a question.
The Southern Pacific Company and the Santa
Fe Railway Company will run within' one block
of the present Bite as soon -as their announced
plans are carried out. .What a beautiful im
pression would be made' on the traveling pub
lie if such a building was maintained on the
main entrance and exit to the city.
. Real estate In the vicinity in consequence is
lower in price than it was thirty years ago.
It is too near a well-settled and rapidly grow
ing section of the city. It was erected nearly
thirty years ago, when the city was a village,
and has been tinkered with beyond all under
standing-. . .â¢ Â¦ â.Â¦
The property owners, taxpayers and resi
dents of the southeast Mission protest against
the expenditure of any money for the Improve
ment of the present hospital for contagious dis
eases, as it is unfit for human habitation and
scarcely lit as a refuge for stray dogs. .
Not Fit for Dogs.
The opposition is summed up by John
Barduhn, treasurer of the improvement
club, who says: i -
This opposition has taken a decided
stand. .The leading spirits of the Potrero
Nuevo Improvement Club have the mat
ter In hand, and some of them say they
are prepared to violate the law, if need
be, to prevent the consummation of pres
ent plans. Among those who are opposed
to any temporizing are Peter Stonberg,
Thomas J. Miller, Augustus Pratt, Max
Popper, George Guthrie, Rasmuasen
Bros., Robert Girdwood and other resi
dents of the district.
Residents of that section of the city
embraced within the district east of How
ard street' and south of Twentieth are
as a unit in opposition to the plan of the
Board of Health and the Health and Po
lice Committee of the Board of Supervis
ors to put election booths on the site of
the leper and smallpox hospital Inclosure
on : Twenty-sixth" street and San Bruno
avenue.' ,. " â¢
Nearly 10,000 residents of this district
are united in this opposition, for they
claim to see in It a perpetuation of the
present undesirable structure, which has
oeen condemned by Boards of Health and
Grand Juries for many years past. They
claim- that the appropriation of $15,0W,
made at the beginning of. the fiscal year,
should be applied to the purchase of a
tract ready tor occupancy, and which
could be properly inclosed within a short
period of time. â¢ -
The delegates in attendance were:
President, W. B. Hlnchman; secretary,
Herbert Hauser; E. J. Lynch, D. D.
Crowley. A. P. Rothkopf, Thomas Harris,
A. H. Mellitz, E. C. Harrington. M. Levy,
George Collopy, P. J. Cadogan, J. Neu
mlller, Charles E>. Snyder, George James.
Ezra Decoto, Charles Cantwell and D. D.
Oliphant. Â¦
David Atkinson, the football player who
struck Umpire Horan on the neld during
a game last November, appealed from the
decision of the registration committee.
He was suspended by the- committee for
one year. Hearing of the case was post
poned until the next meeting.
E. J. Lynch was accepted as a delegate
from the Ariel Club; D. D. Oliphant.
Multnomah Club; Herbert Hauser, Gar
den City Club, and Morris Levy, Hayea
Valley Athletic Club.
It was found that in the past the cus
tom of the association had been to charge
as large a sanction fee as the trarnc
would bear. >
The whole unpleasant business devel
oped over the omission on the part of
Mr." Bockman of presenting his hnal re
ports as chairman of the registration
committee and the regatta committee of
the association at the last annual meet
ing. The reports were ready at the time
and showed a balance due Mr. Bockman
for money expended on behalf of the as
sociation. The reports were called for,
but the chairman the .committee was
not present.
Had the reports been presented the
charges woula never have been filed. The
registration committee is a power unto
itself, and for years has apparently acted
independently of the association. Mr.
Bockman said he had high ideals about
amateurs and refused to class the boys
who box in the local clubs with those who
compete In outdoor athletics. These he
registered separately. Until this was ex
plained he appeared in the light of hav
ing conducted a private registration bu
reau of his own.
On a second charge of issuing unau
thorized registration cards to amateur
boxers and collecting fees for the same,
he was convicted by a vote of 5 to 3.
Herbert Hauser, representing the Aca
demic Athletic League, and George James
of the Olympic Club, who presided over
the meeting, did not vote. Although a
verdict of guilty was recorded no punish
ment is provided under the rules. A. R.
Rothkopt, a member of the registration
committee, voted to exonerate Mr. Bock
man, saying he had acted fully within his
duties. Mr. Hauser was also a member
of the committee.
John R. Bockman. ex-president of the
Pacific Association of the Amateur Ath
letic Union, was acquitted of the charge
of exacting an exorbitant sanction fee
from the Hayes Valley Athletic Club, at
a meeting of the board of governors of the
association held last night in the Olympic
Club.
About two hours later the boat had
drifted bo near the shore that the dark
outline of the trees against the sky could
be made out. Casey and Callaghan im
portuned Ryan to take a chance and
swim to shore, but the latter would not
leave the boat, as he was a poor swim
mer. Finally Casey and Callaghan start
ed" for shore, after promising Ryan that
if they reached it they would come to his
rescue with a boat. When they did find
the overturned boat after daybreak Ryan
had vanished.
Then commenced a battle for life in the
icy sea. When the boat capsized the oars
floated away and It was Impossible to
work toward the shore. Many hours
after the boat capsized Couture and
Smith released their grasp and sank.
They were overcome by the Intense cold
ness of the water, and with a despairing
good-by they went down.
The boat was turned about and headed
for shore, but that action was taken too
late, for in a minute or so the frail craft
was three-quarters tilled with water, and
with an overloaded stagger from side to
side she sank to the level of the gun
wales and then flopped bottom upward.
The five men united In crying for help,
but the sound of their voices was hushed
by the thunder of the elements.
George Callaghan stated that after put
ting olf from shore the boat was pulled
for Rock Bay, but not much progress had
been made when a sea was snipped. Oth
ers followed in quick succession, and
while two men worked at the oars the
other three attempted to ball out the
water, but their efforts were futile, for
the breakers continued to roll In over the
gunwale on the windward side.
Casey and Callaghan were provided
with a boat and they rowed out to the
scene of the drowning, but not a trace of
Ryan could they obtain. On Sunday ef
forts were made to locate the bodies, but
without success.
Five menâ Allen Casey, George Cal
laghan, Joseph Couture, Arthur Smith
and James Ryan â spent Saturday at
Granite Bay". At 9 o'clock that nightthey
started to row to Rock Bay, six miles
away. The boat soon disappeared In the
darkness and nothing was heard from the
men till Casey and Callaghan stumbled
into a cabin at Granite Bay about day
light on Sunday morning with the awful
news that two of the others had been
drowned.
The scene of the triple fatality was
Discovery Passage, a strip of water lying
between Valdes Island and the Vancou
ver Island shore and just above Seymour
Narrows. On Saturday nignt a high aea
was running on the passage and it was
suicidal lor any one to attempt to put
cut in a small boat.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Feb. 13.âOver
come by the intense cold by an all-night
submersion in the Icy "waters of Granite
Bay, in the upper section of the Gulf of
Georgia, three men last Sunday morning
met their Â¦ deaths. Two others had ex
tremely narrow escapes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The schooner Occidental was one of the
fleet of McKay &. Co. of the Occidental
mill. She was a three-masted craft, built
by H. D. Bendixsen in 18S4, and was 120
feet long and 30.5 feet beam. Her gross
tonnage was 209 and net tonnage 173. She
cost about $20,000.
Then began the difficult journey to Pe
trplia. The rains had maae the streams
violent torrents and the rivers were rush
ing down banks full. It took the surviv
ors two days to travel thirty miles.
Enough food came ashore for one meal,
and nothing more was obtained until Pe
trolia was reached Tuesday evening. The
survivors have been two days in traveling
from Petrolia to Eureka, arriving here on
the Eel River and Eureka Railroad Com
pany's train from Sinsleys this afternoon.
Great difficulty was experienced in cross
ing Eel River, which has been too high
to ferrv. The captain and crew braved
the dangers of the current and crossed in
a small boat.
Word was received here Tuesday even
ing from the survivors at Petrolia, but
no notification could be sent to the owners
outside the county, as Eureka and Hum
boldt County towns have been entirely
cut off from outside communication for
over a week. Both the telegraph and tel
ephone lines were carried down by the
severity of the storm.
The vessel was carried ashore broadside,
striking the sandy bottom with such force
that her masts were jumped out of her.
Before the captain ana crew left the ship
she had begrun to go to pieces.
After the ship strucK a sailor, Andrew
Anderson, went overboard with a rope
around his waist. He reached the shore
and made the rope fast. Over this rope
the captain and the remaining members of
the crew reached shore in safety .
The point at which the vessel stranded
is between Point Gorda, known as the
"marine graveyard," and Shelter Cove.
The crew, consisting of Captain Luberg,
two mates, four sailors and tiie cook, John
Gallup, formerly master of the schooner
Mary Dodge, all reached shore.
EUREKA. Feb. 13.â The schooner Occi
dental, from San Pedro, carried by wind
and waves, went ashore Sunday morning
at S:SO o'clock on a low sandy beach on
the southern Humboldt coast, known as
China. Flat. _Â¦ .^-?.

If your hair is brittle and thinning, you
have dandruff. The mere scouring of
the ecalp of the loose scales won't cum
dandruff; because dandruff is nothing: but
Ecalea of scalp being thrown up by a pes-
tiferous little germ in burrowing its way
to the root of the hair where it saps the
vitality, causing falling hair and in time
baldness. Now, you can't stop dandruff,
nor falling hair, nor prevent baldness un-
less you destroy that germ; and the only
preparation that can do it Is the new bcI-
entiflc discovery. Newbro's Herpicide. In
fact, no other hair preparation claims to
kill the dandruff germâ all of them will
clean the scalp: soap and water will do
:>at, but only ICewbro's Herpicide gets at
the root of the trouble and kills the dan-
â¬ruff germ.

Corliss, who Is author of a b:ll for a
Government cable from San Francisco to
Manila, delivered a speech in opposition
to the laying of such a cable by a private
corporatioiu.-
Two bills of general importance weie
passed by the House to-day, the remainder
of the time being devoted to minor busi
ness. One was a. Senate bill to provida
for the payment* of the claims of Confed
erate ofScera and soldiers whose horses,
side arms and baggage were taken from
them by Union soldiers contrary to the
terms of the surrender of Lee's and John
son's armies. The amount to be paid un
der the bill was limited to $50,000. Tha
other bill was to confer on the Spanish
Claims Commission authority to send for
persons and papers and to punisn for con
tempt.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.-The House to
day unanimously adopted a resolution
proposing an amendment to the constitu
tion of the United States for the election
of Senators by direct popular vote. There
was no demand for time to debate the
resolution. This is the fourth time tha
House has adopted a similar resolution.
The last bout of the night was between
Al Hamilton and Jack Kenny; It was
a rough one while it lasted. Hamilton
quit, after the first round. He said the
other boxer punched . too hard.
Al Young, a youth built like a heavy
weight, drew the disapproval of those
present by trying to hustle little Charlie
Smelter around. The bout was declared
a di^iw, but the decision should have been
given to Smelter. .; -Â¦ â¢Â¦ . -
Jack Cordell and Bart Nugent locked
arms for four rounds and' Referee Greg
gains lost weight separating them. * Cor
dell wrestled Nugent to the floor, picked
him up and then crossed him on the jaw.
It was so funny | the spectators laughed
heartily. Cordell was given the decision.
Dave Attel lowered the colors of Joe
Reagan In the third round of their bout.
It was a rushing- battle all the way, with
Attel the aggressor. Â¦Â¦-..â¢? : ..-Â¦â¢Â¦
Jack McFadden battered George O'Brien
to the floor after two minutes' fighting.
McFadden did not give O'Brien : a chanco
to leave his corner.
Pete Carroll and John Crpll fought four
rounds to a draw. Both Â¦ lads . boxed
speedily and displayed cleverness. Carroll
was the aggressor, but Croll
well. The decision met with ap
proval. Al Meala and H. Sheehan In

Mrs. Annie M. Ives and members of her

friends and acquaintances for their kindnesses
In their sad bereavement, .The City Engineer was directed to make
plans and estimates of the project ac
cording to the charter and subject to the
City Attorney's opinions, one of which
is whether the preliminary steps for the
acquisition of the road may be taken be
fote the franchise expires.
Had Captain Catterinich taken a cast of his
lead at the time he thought the ship was too
close to the land and held off only one point,
as a more careful navigator would have done,
and not depended upon his judgment for his
distance from the shore on a dark night with
heavy rain, clouds and smoke hanging over
the land he would have seen the clanger the
vessel was In at the time. He had a patent
sounding machine on board.
Captains O. F. Bolles and John K. Bul
ger, United States Local Inspectors of
Steam. Vessels, rendered their decision
yesterday morning in the matter of the
stranding of the steamship San Bias near
La Libertad, Salvador, and revoked the
license of J. F. Catterinich, master of the
vessel, for carelessness. In the decision
the Inspectors say:
Inspectors Bolles and Bulger Revoke
His License for Losing the
San Bias.
CAiPTAIN CATTEBINICH
? RELIEVED FROM DUTY
City Engineer Grunsky stated that the
route originally proposed was circuitou3
and included a cross-town line. The. total
length of the road would be fifteen miles,
of which three and a half miles consti
tuted the road as now operated. It would
cost but $50,000 to change the present. road
into an underground electric conduit sys
tem. Grunsky suggested another route
from the ferry along Market street to
Geary street, to Tenth avenue, thence to
the park. An electric system embracing
this route would cost $500,000. The road
could also be run down Second street to
the depots and extended along C street to
the ocean, should it be desired. The plan
also included a cross-town line from the
Presidio across certain streets, termina
ting at the Potrero. Another branch
could be run along Nineteenth avenue
across the park to the Ingleside House.
Max Popper spoke for Mission residents
and argued that the road should be con
fined to its present route, with the ex
tension to the ferry and the park. Pop
per said the road could be operated to
carry workingmen during certain hours
for Vfa cents, and the other street railways
would have to come down to the rate
charged by the municipal road.
J. P. Henderson agred with Popper and
said that the people would vote for the
shorter route and that there was consid
erable opposition, to the proposed cross
town line. E. P. E. Troy of the Rich
mond Improvement Club also spoke in
favor of the modified plan. Supervisor
Wynn said he was opposed to. any feed
ers to the line until it had been demon
strated that the city could run the sys
tem properly. Mayor Schmitz favored the
route from the ferry to the park with a
Second-street branch, if such were pos
sible. Supervisors Braunhart, D'Ancona
Curtis and O'Connor also expressed them- 1
selves in favor of the shorter route.
A , resolution was adopted declaring it
the sense of the board that a publicly
owned road be operated on Geary street
when the present franchise expires. The
City Attorney .was requested to advise
whether the franchise expires in April
1902. or November, 1903.
Wynn's motion that\the route be con
fined to a line from the ferry to the park
prevailed. The question of fares was left
to regulate after the road is acquired.
The Supervisors' Public Utitlities Com
mittee met yesterday to determine the
proper method of procedure in' the pro
posed acquisition of the Geary-street
road and to decide on the route- to be
traversed by the extension intended to be
made to its present limits. Mayor Schmltz
and several representatives of various im
provement clubs were present at the
meeting- and made suggestions in connec
tion with the project.
Dr. Smith says there were forty-two
deaths at the mining camp. Of those who
died only four were men who were not
of dissipated habits. The physician saya
that the report that the place was vis
ited by a plague Is incorrect. He la ot
the opinion that the disease was endemic
and was perhaps la grippe.
Dr. Smith highly praises the action of
the miners' union during the sickness.
He says that the union erected a hospi
tal with accommodations for many pa
tients and the society spent thousands In
relieving the sick.
"There are only about 500 peopie at
Tonopah at present," he, said. "We all
expect, however, that within two months
the population will spring up to 2C0O.
I think the camp will become as rich and
as well known as Nome or Dawaon.
Among the arrivals at the Occidental 13
Dr. Landon R. Smith, a physician of
Tonopah, Nev. He is down from the min
ing camp with portions of bodies of men
who met death at the camp, which he
will send to the Marine Hospital to be
carefully examined, so that the disease
which carried off so many miners at
Tonopah recently can be officially diag
nosed.

Preliminary Hearing of Thomas G.
UMLAND TEIXS OF MtTBDER.
The purpose of the company is to em
ploy American 'labor so tar as possible
in the development of the properties
o-wned by the company and others which
are to be aecuired. Several sugar mills
will be erected, all to be equipped with
the latest and best machinery. Much of
the land held by the company offers su
perior inducements to agriculturists and
in order to secure good people these will
be !eased or sold to settlers at merely
nominal sums. All produce will be handled
by the company and transported by the
company's steamers to San Francisco as a
distributing point. Trade with the island
ers v.-ill be encouraged and it is believed
this will do more to pacify the natives
than anything the army now in the Phil
ippines can hope to do.
In order that there may be no trouble as
to titles to lands to be acquired by the
company or colonists, Congress will be
asked to pass laws by which the present
clouds on titles to property in the Philip
pines may be removed. Congress will be
requested to make special grants to the
company and assist the enterprise in
every possible way. With these purposes
In view, Messrs. Clunie and King visited
\\ asnington several weeks ago and thev
report that they met with the warmest
encouragement The gentlemen named
will leave for the national capital within
the next ten days to mature plans which
are now under consideration.
Â¦ The company has options on several
large Spanish grants, but until Congress
confirms the title thereto by special legis
lation their acquisition cannot be finallv
consummated. This done the company
will "incorporate, a step to be followed
S^jSginS^ Â° f a -te.nufl.lp line
The company intends to purchase a
Bteamer within the next few days and
formally begin business. Laborers will be
sent to the islands and company buildings
will be erected on the island of Mindao,
on which land has been acquired. The
precise location of this post is kept a
secret, but as soon as a basis of operations
has been established trading posts will be
inaugurated in various parts of the island.
As soon as this preliminary work has been
accomplished the company will reincor
porate under another name with a capital
Of *20,000,000.
The objects of the new company were
made public by the directors after the 111
ing of the articles. Since the acquisition
ol the islands by tne United States neany
ail of the traoe has been diverted to
German and English marts. Compara
tively little of the produce of the islands
has found its way to this country through
San Francisco, the natural gateway di
viding this country and the Philippines.
In order to divert this traffic into the
logical channels this company three
years ago sent Professor Perry Hayne of
the State University to the islands with
a view to studying the possibilities of ac
complishing that and other ends. His re
port was most favorable and o/i its re
ceipt immediate steps toward " incorpora
tion were taken.

An enterprise of international impor
tance was inaugurated yesterday by the
filing of articles of incorporation of the
Philippine Exploration Company, with a.
capital stock Ol tdOD.WQ, of which flsu.OW
has been subscribed.
As the prosecution desired to call Hay
wards as a witness Judge Cook adjourned
the hearing of the case until 10 o'clock
this morning. The case Is expected to go
to the Jury this afternoon, as the defense
announced yesterday that it would call
no witnesses as to Gillespie's character,
and arguments of counsel will be mado
to-day.
Mrs. Griffin, the widow of the man
killed by Gillespie, testified that on the
night of the shooting her husband came
home quarrelsome and broke a number
of dishes. She denied that her husband
had abused or had used insulting lan
guage toward Mrs. Gillespie.
In answer to a question by the attor
neys for the defense Mrs. Griffin stated
that she did not know why her husband
broke the dishes and was in a quarrel
some state. She supposed that it was on
account of having had words with some
one before he arrived home.
Calvert was called by the prosecution
to testify, but made a poor witness, and
his version of the affair was of a nature
to indicate that Gillespie was not /to
blame.
'ine prosecution sought to impeach Gil
lespie's testimony by showing that he
hau bitten the ear of a young man named
Robert G. Calvert. Before Calvert was
called Gillespie volunteered a statement
as to his trouble with him. lie stated
that Calvert and a companion named
Maywards had roomed in nis house and
he had reprimanded them for making a
noise in the early hours of the morning.
The two men attacked Gillespie and a
rough and tumble fight ensued, when Gil
lespie defended himself.
When the trial was resumed yesterday
Giilesjiie was piacea on trie witness stand
tor the purpose of cross-examination by
tue prosecution. The defendant was
asked a& to certain testimony given by
him at tne preliminary examination, when
he stated that he had never been
in trouble before and had never been ar
rested.
The trial of George D. Gillespie for the
murder of William D. Griffin on the night
of August 20 last was resumed yesterday
! before Judge Carroll Cook and a jury.
j* Gillespie, who was the landlord of a
' lodging-house at 119 Ninth street, shot
