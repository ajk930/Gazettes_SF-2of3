to-day issued a decree- appropriating the

Germany is. again preparing!
for the naval demonstration in"
Venezuelan waters which was;
delayed in the hope that the :
present insurrection -against;
the Castro government . would re
sult in the downfall of./ the President/
The cruiser Gazelle sailed to-day for.
Venezuela, and it is expected that other
vessels will be added. to the already for-:
midable fleet hovering near the coast of;
the South American republic. " It is be-;
lieved here that the Government has re
solved not to await the result of the.
Venezuelan revolution, but will at once
move for the seizure of a port to enforce
the payment of its claim. As Castro con
tinues defiant, there is no present' hope
for a peaceful settlement. . .,*'/
In <3iplornatic circles there is a disposi
tion to regard Emperor William's friendly
overtures to the United States with es
pecial Interest, in view of the growing
enmity between his country and Great
Britain. The people of Germany heartily
dislike Great Britain, as shown by their
criticism of the Emperor's ' policy, two
years ago, of fostering friendly relations
with that Government, and by the recent
attack on Great Britain. The triple alli
ance has not been renewed, and it is not
settled that it will be. Germany needs a
friend, and diplomats say she has finally
come to the conclusion that, in view of
possible European complications, it would
be Â¦wise to be on good terms with the
United States. Diplomats say that there
is now. apparently, a rivalry between
Germany and Great Britain for American
friendship.
Prince Henry will be treated with the
most distinguished courtesy. Upon his ar
rival at New York, he will be received by
representatives of the President and of
the Army and Navy and by a military es
cort. Before he lands, a salute of twenty
one guns, the number given to the Presi
dent, will be fired. At the launching of
the imperial yacht, which will be chris
tened by Miss Roosevelt, his address will
be answered by the President in terms as
cordial as he himself will employ. "When
he reaches Washington he will be re
celvel by the President and will be In
cited to be the guest of the Â¦ nation. - He
may prefer to stop at the German em
bassy. Following his call upon the Presi
dent. Mr. Roosevelt will return the cour
tesy and will subsequently invite him to
a dinner, which will be attended by the
most prominent men of the country.

"W., "WASHINGTON. Jan. 12.â Prince Hen
ry of Prussia Is to be given a reception
befltttag the high station he occupies as
the representative of such a great nation
as Gerafany. The programme for his wel
come, â¢which will be immediately pre
pared, is almost as interesting a subject
of speculation in diplomatic circles as are
the reasons which induced Emperor Wil
liam to send him here. The importance
attached to the programme arises out of
the belief of diplomats that it will demon
strate Just how far the American Govern
ment is willing to go to meet Kaiser Wil
helm in improving the relations between
the United States and Germany. During
and following the Spanish-American War
the relations of the two countries were
unpleasant, and a suspicion of Germany's
purposes still exists, notwithstanding the
strenuous efforts made by the Kaiser to
remove it.

CHICAGO. Jan. ,12.â A book entitled
"Schley "and Santiago" is on" the press in
this city and will be bound within ten
days. The author is George E. Graham.
a war correspondent,.? who was: on- the
Brooklyn during, the fight with the ! Span
ish fleet, and 'was' thus in a position to
tell the story of Santiago "without fear
or favor." The book is said to have the
unqualified indorsement- of Rear Admiral
Schley,. who read. and corrected the proof
sheets. When ' President Roosevelt was
Governor of New, York he was -present
when Graham gave an, account of the bat
tle to State officials arid members of the
Legislature. Mr. 1 Roosevelt said at that
time: ' ', -v
I am sure you feel as pleased at having lis
tened to Mr. -Graham asl do, for I have listen
ed to the best, account I -have ever heard or
read of the naval fighting during this war. . "..
Story of Flying Squadron. ,
This book is the first and only complete
story of the work of the flying. squadron,
corn'manded by Schley. was as
sisted by his .camera, which enabled him
to add many interesting situations,, and
the description' and the movements of the
fleet and the' battle are evidently sincere.
It Is free from virulent and personal at
tacks; the aim is to give a truthful state
ment of everjr occurrence. In connection
with the arrival} of the New York^ Gra
ham says: . " . .
The commodore reached over to me.; took my
glasses, and looked eearchingly to .the , east,
saying . slowly as he did so": /"There . Is the

for he remarked: '"Yes/, there she is. '.,. I can
tell' her by her : 'smoke." ' This was at 1:45
o'clock, and the Colon had gone ashore at 1:15.
while Captain Cook had received the surrender,
at 1:43. At 2 o'clock. Just as the New York
got where "we could read her. In signal distance.
Commodore Schley ordered' the signal raised:
"A glorious victory J has ; been achieved. / De-'
tails later." This signal replaced the" -one
which we" had been .flying for nearly .three
quarters of an hour. "The enemy has surren
dered," and which the New Tork had. not an
swered. Vainly the signal officers on. the
bridge watched the New York" for even, the
courtesy of an answering pennant showing that
she understood our signal.' None was display
ed, and then it- apparently dawned upon Com
modore Schley's mind that' Sampson's flag cap
tain on the New York was probably Intent upon
ignoring him. .'
Affront Offered by Sampson.
Picking up the megaphone, \ Commodore
Schley did the one thing, that day for which
I have always criticized him â lowered his. dig
nity sufficiently to plead with the commander
of the fleet that he -might have the ' surrsnder
of the ship whose escape had been frustrated
by the Brooklyn and : the Oregon, j thus mak
ing complete the day's victory. â¢, V : '
"I request . the honor of the surrender of the
Cristobal Colon." â¢- he said. In a . clear, : dis
tinct voice; and from the commander In chief's
flagship came, wafted back the insolent answer
from a cadet: Â¦ ,
v\Vhat?" . ..'â¢ ; : .
' "I request the honor of the surrender of the
Colon," again called the commodore, and Â¦ this
time his voice trembled slightly. We watched
the bridge of the New. York closely, waited In-'
tently for an answer, but none came. And'
" that message, as had , all the others preceding
It since the destruction of ' the Spanish fleet,
which had -been addressed by Schley . to" the
New York, ', remained , unanswered. â¢â¢'. '
Somebody relsed a broom at our masthead on
one of the pennant halyards and the crew of
the Oregon followed suit and then gave \ three
cheers for Commodore Schley. On- the Texas
the men all lined up oh. the forward deck, and,'
at the request of somebody, aboardâ I -presume
of Philip himselfâ gave three cheers for Com
modore Schley. , The little Vixen. came around
three or four times, her crew yelling themselves
hoarse : for { the Brooklyn, for Schley / and â¢ for

came never a sound, of; Joy fulness and never a
cheer. Â¦.-'... " .- '". Â¦' Â¦ ' ' ' '- .
"My wife and I were driving along the^
road toward Sausalito when we flrst^
noticed that some trouble had occurred
between several boys who were out shoot
ing ducks.. I saw the lad who was shot
lying on the ground. I saw McCarthy
running away and my wife and v 1 gave
chase in the buggy and I captured Mc-
Carthy and took the Thomas boy along
as a witness. Upon arriving at Sausa
lito I' turned ' them over to Constable
Creed." "_ , :
The officials at Sausalito place little cre
dence in McCarthy's story of the trouble.
Thomas was timid about giving the offi
cers any information concerning the trou
ble, and McCarthy's statements were
guarded and meager. He said that young
McLeod was at fault in the argument,
and when he interfered and attempted to
tell him so. McLeod grew abusive and
commenced, without any cause, whatever,
hurling big stones at his head. McCarthy
claims that he simply aimed his weapon
at McLeod _ to : frighten him so that ha
would stop throwing rocks, and during the
excitement the shotgun was accidentally
discharged.
McCarthy said that hl3 father was a
member of the San Francisco Fire De
partment, but further than that he would
give the officers no information concern
ing himself.
Late last night McLeod's condition. had
not changed. He was restless and suffer
ing great pain, but his physicians held
out, strong hope for his ultimate recov
ery. Young McLeod drives an, Ice wason
In Sausalito and the vicinity and is well
known all over Marin County.
Those who know him, well claim that
McLeod is an Inoffsensive. quiet chap and
not Inclined to quarrel with.his compan
ions.' *
Mr. Kohn. who placed McCarthy under
arrest, was seen last night at his apart
ments' in the Savoy. He said:
Claims It Was Accidental.
The three boys had been shooting duck3
at Alameda Point all day yesterday.
About 3:30 o'clock one of them brought
down a duck and the Thomas boy and
young McLeod became involved in an
argument as to which one of them
"killed it. McCarthy interfered and
slapped' McLeod's face, whereupon the
latter, who is no match for McCarthy in
size, ran away a -rew steps and picking
up a rock burled It at his assailant. He
was about to throw another rock when
McCarthy leveled the shotgun at him
and fired.
McLeod fell on the roadside in an un
conscious condition with blood streaming
from his wounds. McCarthy, still cling
ing to his weapon, ran down the road
toward Sausalito, followed by Thomaa,
in a vain effort to escape.
Shortly after the, shooting P. Kohn, a
carpet dealer, drove along the road with,
his wife. They were coming from San
Anselmo, and upon arriving on the scene
they discovered the victim of McCarthy's
wrath lying on the road. They sent for
assistance and McLeod was removed to
his home and a physician hastily sent for.
Mr. and Mrs. Kohn then drove along the
road' at a fast clip in the hope of over
taking the fleeing youth who did the
shooting. As they neared Sausalito Mrs.
Kohn caught sight of McCarthy, and sho
hailed him. Both McCarthy and his com
panion, Thomas, seemed very much
frightened, and when they came alongside
the buggy Mr. Kohn jumped out and dis
arming McCarthy placed him and Thom
as under arrest. He brought them into
Sausalito, where he turned them over to
Constable Creed. Both boys were locked
Hunt Ends in Quarrel.
McCarthy is under arrest at Sausalito
and will be held pending the result of
young McLeod's injuries. McLeod is ly
ing at his home at Alameda Point in a
critical condition and a physician is con
stantly at his bedside.
The shooting occurred' over a harmless
argument as to which one of the two boys
shot'a duck. McCarthy, the lad who did
the shooting, was not a party to the dis
cussion, so it is said, but he became in
volved in the trouble by taking the part
of his companion, Edward Thomas, whose
father" Is foreman in the machine shops
of the North Shore Railroad at Sausalito.
Ross McLeod," a 16-year-old boy, threw
a stone at W. McCarthy, another youth,
on the Marin County road, near Sausalito,
yesterday afternoon, and the latter raised
a shotgun he was carrying to his shoulder
and discharged both barrels into young
McLeod's face. ; The leaden pellets tore
McLeod's face Into shreds, ana several .t
them entered his right eye. Instantly de
stroying its sight.
The other eye was also badly injured,
and if the shooting affray doe3 not prova
fatal the young, man will probably never
regain his sight.

LONDON, Jan. 12.â The advance that
was recently made on the Stock Exchange
on the strength of more encouraging news
from South Africa was not maintained
during the last week, except in the" shares
of the British Chartered South . African
Company and Kaffirs. It Is said by some
observers, however, that the movement
in the shares of the Chartered Company
is largely artificial.
The majority of securities on the Stock
Exchange were dull and depressed during
the past week, however, Americans lag
ging generally below, parity. Home rails
were very dull 'in spite, of the confident
talk of improved dividends. .The Â¦ chief
causes of public dissatisfaction -with -the
present situation arising from the failure
of the War. Office to show substantial re
sults in South Africa after the recent op
timistic predictions of the collapse of Boer
resistance and from a further large loan
â¢ expected next March or April, which it is
believed will adversely affect prices.
There is much interest in the great to
bacco combine, to be floated with the pur
pose of fighting against tobacco interests.
In connection with this combine,, there are
rumors of American tariff concessions for
Cuban. tobacco and it is said if these be
consummated they are likely to upset the
entire British \ tobacco market and cause
a further. : serious disturbance. - These
rumors have already agitated this branch
of industrial securities. Â¦ .

The chief interest of the week will cen
ter in hearings on Cuban reciprocity to
begin at 10 o'clock on "Wednesday morn
ing before the Ways and Means Commit
tee. . The hearings will continue several
days, and it. Is expected -that General
Wood, prominent in Cuban affairs as well
as the interests opposed to reciprocity
will address the committee. - .
Among the measures -which there will
be an effort to get out of committee dur
ing the jweek are: The Nicaraguan canal
bil i' -. the ;P.Â£ illp J? lne tarlff blu an< * the ship
subsidy bill. The indications are that the
Nicaragua bill will be reported practically
as it passed the House, and that the ship
ping bill will .not be materially amended
but the Republican leaders have practi
cally decided to make a material reduc
tion of the tariff on -Philippine imports.
It is not probable that the discussion of
either of these questions will begin for
some time. , The utmost that is to be ex
pected in that direction is a preliminary
arrangement for. consideration. Which of
the measures shall receive first attention
is - not yet determined and considerable
rivalry is likely to develop for precedence.
All of the three measures will be debated
at some length when- taken up by the
Senate.
The really important work of the House
of Representatives, aside from the Nica
raguan canal bill, is still In the committee
stage, so that there la little of importance
to be considered during. the coming week.
Monday will be given to" bills affecting
the District of Columbia. After, that the
pension appropriation bill will be passed.
Although this measure carries about 5139 -
000,000, it follows the department estimate's
and does not involve any serious Issues,
so that after a brief explanation its pas
sage usually follows prpmptly. The Ways
and Means Committee has a few minor
bills on, the calendar for the redemption
of revenue stamp's made worthless by the
repeal of certain features of the war rev

Mrs. Gregory is not a business woman
in the narrow sense of the world, but con
stant association with her husband in the
maturing of his plans for the mills has
given her a lively sense of conditions.
With characteristic self sacrifice she put
aside her personal sorrow in the moment *
of emergency and assumed the responsi
bility which should preserve the ideal of
the Gregory mills and the well being of its
WIckford clientele. '
William Gregory had promised his op
eratives that, winter or summer, work
would always be forthcoming. In dull
times no "shutdown" was permitted to
interfere with the community's prosper
ity. The mills are kept strictly abreast
of present ijay requirements, the worsted*
turned out are of the best, and the Greg
ory home, a delightful eojonial mansion,
stands ' like a sentinel watch over their
interests just across the'- cove. ' t'
When Governor Gregory, died on Decem
i ber 16 the. business he' Oiad established "'Â¦
was. incorporated, with the family as .its
officers. Albert Winson Gregory, .who is
not yet of age, relinquished his course at
Brown University to assume the posit-on
of superintendent. The house on Broad
way, which had been the family residence
during the student life of the son and the
daughter, Mary Louise, just graduated
' from Pembroke Hall, the women's annex
of the university, was given up. Mrs.
Gregory went back to the Wickforjl home,
recently remodeled under her direction as
a country seat, and gave herself- to the
which will bring her into promi
nence .as -one of the foremost business
women in America. She has become the
head of the Gregory mills, which are the
center of the business activity of the lit
tle town of Wickford, and by so doing
has averted not only temporary loss to
the factory world, but the ultimate pass

.There is abundant promise of an excit

incidents which have already enlivened
the trial. . -
Although the names of the men have
been included in the list of those men
tioned by the State's witnesses as having
contributed to the accomplishment of the
crime, the Grand Jury for some unex
plained reason- did not indict them on the
original charge of the murder of Calvin
Hall. The new warrants will accuse them
of having murdered Jim Hall, Frank Hall,
Daniel Yantis and Martin Wilson.
-It had been supposed that a sufficient
guard was already on hand, but apjiarent

lieves in the ounce of prevention truism
and proposes to take no â¢chances.
It is expected that Mary Lorenz, the
daughter of Calvin Hall, will to-morrow

Special Dispatch to The Call:
The Berlin correspondents of the Lon
don papers express varying opinions of
the quarrel. The representative of ths
Dally Mail claims to know that Emperor
William will not suffer Count von Bulow
to make any more concessions to the An
glophobe feeling. This correspondent says
a successor to Count von Bulow is al
ready knocking at the door and will glad
ly enter and try to better Interpret the
Emperor's wishes.
On the other hand, the Berlin corre
spondent of the Daily Chronicle believes
that the tardy official denial of the state
ment that Emperor William was going to
England shows that the latter has
changed his mind because of the Von
Bulow-Chamberlain dispute, and that Em
peror William originally intended to be
present at the memorial service for the
fate Queen Victoria at. Frogmore.
Situation in Berlin.
The Daily Mail believes that the quarrel
between Count von Bulow and Chamber
lain can benefit neither party, but admits
that Chamberlain has nothing to with
draw. But the paper cannot forget that
almos*. yearly Chamberlain has offended
some great power. First it was Russia,
then France. He irritated America by
suggesting an alliance, and is now work
ing into a quarrel with Germany, which
may go further. Great Britain's hands
are too full in South Africa to want trou
ble with Germany. The Dally Mail ex
presses thankfulness that Chamberlain is
not the British Minister of Foreign Af
fairs
The Dally Chronicle, writing on lines
somewhat similar to those of the Daily
Mail, wishes that the masterful Minister
could learn sufficient dignity and patriot
ism to sink his own personality in the
consideration of imperial interests. It de
clares that a burst of national enthusiasm
might have resulted from Saturday's
speech, /tout that the country remembers
Chamberlain' 3 previous speech, in which,
he shamelessly touted for a German al
liance.
The Dally News In an angry denuncia
tion declares the Colonial Secretary to ba
suffering from a "swelled head."
The Times unreservedly applauds Cham
berlain's reply to Count von Bulow as the
only kind the spokesman of a nation not
lost to self-respect could make to such at

Chamberlain's Past Offenses.
LONDON. Jan. 12.â The speech of Colo
nial Secretary Chamberlain at Birming
ham is being commented upon from the
party standpoint. It was delivered at the
annual dinner of the Jewelers* and Silver
smiths' Association, an entirely non-par
tisan gathering.. Chamberlain was in high
spirits and spoke more deliberately than
usual, puffing a cigar at Intervals. His
references to Count von Bulow, the Im
perial Chancellor of Germany, were calm
ly and even contemptuously given,.
Chamberlain's reply meets , approval
from men of his own party, but in many
quarters friendly to his policy regntt is
expressed that he should thrust hi3 own
personality so much to the front.
The Morning Post says that in thi3 mat

"As for college fads, they are bad. The
regular college curriculum is the thing
to follow, and when students go chasing
after this thing and that thing they tum
ble over. There are too many fads and
one of the worst is the habit of sending
girls away to schools where the tuition
alone amounts to several hundred dollars
a year.
"I am in favor of dormitories and think
that all college students should live In
them. There is no use paying more than
$2 a week for board, and $150 should carry
any young man or young woman through
college for a year."
Dr. Pearsons thinks sawing wood or
raising potatoes would prove more effec
tive for the muscular development of stu
dents than playing football or baseball.
Incidentally, Dr. Pearsons declared
against college fads and expressed his be
lief that $150 a year should be enough to
eupply an- education to any boy.
"They are through raising the kind of
boys in the East that made this country
;what it is," declared Dr. Pearsons, "and
! the type of men are growing up in the
West that madfe New England famous 100
vears ago. The Eastern boys are effemi
nate. They are being reared in too much
luxury and have not that sturdiness that
characterizes the boy of the West.
"There is great promise in the young
men of these Western States. They are
poor and cannot go to college. It be
comes the duty of some one to 'take the
college to them. Every State in the Unioii,
save Wyoming and Oklahoma, has. plenty
of colleges and some of them would be
better off if they hadn't so many. The
trouble is that we get too great 'a num
ber of cheap colleges. They lower the
standard. â¢ . ; .--Â¦â¢â¢ .
'â¢I have had the greatest satisfaction
from the contributions f made in the
West, and I am through with Eastern
colleges. My next donation will be west
of Chicago, but I am not going to give
any more until- 1 get all my pledges paid
up. I have about JiOO.Otti in pledges now
outstanding. ; Â¦ " *
"I don't propose to have it said that
Dr. Pearsons died in debt, so I have given
these colleges just one year from January
1 to meet my conditionsâ no more, no less.
When this load is off my mind I'll give
away the rest. I'm not going to leave an
estate for lawyers to quarrel over.
CHICAGO, Jan. 12.â Dr. D. K. Pearsons,
the aged philanthropist who has endowed
.so many small colleges, admits he is cou
;emplating further gifts to the struggling
schools of the Far West. Oklahoma and
, rt'yoming, declared Dr. Pearsons*, were
sorely in need of colleges that would be
accessible to the young men of those re
?icns. Not only docp Dr. Pearsons recog
nize this need, but he declares that the
young men of the West are the real
strength of the nation. Eastern boys, he
says, have few of the rugged qualities
that great men must possess. j,*^

John A. Phelps of the Hotel, Repelier,

21, 1901:
Q._It Is hard for people to believe
Bright's Disease and Diabetes are at last
curable. Will you let us mention your
case? ;i
A.â You may. I've told many about it.
Q^âDld physicians declare it Diabetes?
A. A' half dozen did. For three years

j my business. The last doctor thought I'd
1 live only about six weeks and advised mo
I to straighten out my affairs.
q._ How soon did you begin to mend
I under the Fulton Compounds?
'A.â The specific gravity soon began to
drop,- but it was nearly a year before 1
was perfectly sound. '"
Q.â Did any, whom you told of it take it?
A.â Several cases of Diabetes and
Brl^ht's Disease, upon hearing my experi-
ence, took it and recovered.
o Can you recall the names?
A âI don't like to mention them without
their permission. One was a friend in Col-
linwood, Ohio, who was pensioned oft by
his company as incurable. He recovered.
Another was that of a well-to-do lady in
this city, who was also given up. by her
physicians. She is now perfectly well.
h. What do you think now of the cura-
bility of chronic Bright' a Disease and Dia-

cian now believes she will recover.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12.â Mrs. Ada Gil
bert Dennis, the fashionable modiste who
was murderously assaulted on thought
of the 8th of December,, was able for the
first time to-day to make a statement.
The police have been hopef ul^that what
she;would say would throw some light on
the'motive for the crime . or lead to". the
discovery of the perpetrator, but - Mrs.
Dennis' statement contained nothing that
would give any clew in either direction.
She said she remembers nothing about the
attack upon her and said the . blow was
struck while she was sleeping.. Nor- had
she the remotest idea who committed the
assault or the motive for It. Mrs. Dennis
said she had- not; been out of. the house
during the evening of the; assault and
that before retiring she had , locked the
doors ; to the front and back; part of the
house. The latter she occupied as a bed
room. One feature of Mrs. Dennis' state
ment that puzzles : the police is that she
said her revolver and her money . were
under her pillow when she retired. When
the crime was discovered the next morn
ing ' the revolver . was in a drawer of a
secretary near by and- the money was in
a pocketbook in a box â¢ on a ' table ' near
the bed.'. The police are more mystified
than ever over the affair.

Pearlstein, his wife and five children,
ranging in age from 18 months to 12
years, were burned to death early to-day
in a lire that destroyed a two-story frame
building. Joseph Supowskl, who owned
the building, and Karl Bracki, his broth
er-in-law, have been arrested pending an
inxestigation. Supowski carried an in
surance of $9000 on the building and its
contents.
The Pearlsteins and another family
lived in rooms above a shoe store and
were asleep when the fire started. Supow
ski told the police to-day that he acci
dentally dropped a lamp. A few minutes
after the fire began there was a loud ex
plosion that blew out the front of the
store and hurled some of the contents of
the windows into the middle of the street.
Plate glass windows on the opposite side
of Broadway were shattered by the ex
plosion, and the report was heard two
blocks away. The flames enveloped the
building in a short time. The family liv
ing in the rear fiat barely escaped with
their lives. The Pearlsteins were awak
ened, but before they could reach the
only stairway leading from their rooms
the fire had undermined the floor in the
hallway and it collapsed, carrying them
down into a mass of flames. Their
charred bodies were found at 8 o'clock
four hourT after the firemen had extin
guished the flames. The body of the
mother and baby were found together
the little one tightly clasped in Its moth
er's arms. Pearlstein's body was found
close to that of his wife. He also held

bodies of the other three children were

Holt was with the United States troops
in China and deserted after Peking was
taken by the allies. He was arrested,
tried by court-martial and found guilty as
charged. He was sentenced to serve three
years on Alcatraz. He had been on the
island six months and his conduct waa
such that he earned the privilege to be
called a "trusty" and was put in charge
of the masonry work.
It was while at his post that he pro
cured a box which is used by the Govern
ment to take shoes to the islandâ a box
measuring 3x3x4 feet. Surreptitiously
he worked upon it, making a cover with
hinges on the inside and a contrivance
which would fasten the cover also from
the inside. When the box was finished to
his satisfaction he placed It behind the
hospital, and from day to day gathered
un an old uniform which he concealed in
it. "When he considered all was safe and
ready, Holt wrote an order to the "boss"
teamster for Its removal to the McDowell,
forging theron the name of Quartermaster
West. .
Holt will be returned to the military au
thorities, where from "trusty" he will be
put down to the lowest grade. A dungeon
and bread and water will, in all
probability, be his lot for fourteen days,

The Commercial Company has already
presented in writing to the Government
the terms which it is willing to accept
and they go even further than the terms
imposed upon the French company and
the United States and Haytl Company.
It has gone even further than this and
accepted the post road act of 1S66, by
Â¦which th<^. United States Government has
at any time the right to purchase the
cable at its appraised value and in the
meantime the Postmaster General has the
right to fix the rate for Government mes
sages.
The hearings have occupied the atten
tion of the committee Sot two days and
will go on Ihis week. There are already
pending In the present Congress seven
bills on the subject of Pacific cables. Five
of these provide for the Government lay
ing a cable which will come into competi
tion with the Commercial Company; one
provides for a Government subsidy of
$300,030 per year for twenty years to a
private enterprise for laying and operat
ing such competing cable.
One bill, which seems to be aimed
directly at the Commercial Company, pro
hibits any one from laying a cable ex
cept on condition that the Government
shall have the right to purchase, or to
fix the rate at which Government mes
sages shall be sent and such further con
ditions and terms as the President may
deem proper.
This company has, through its auxiliary,
i he Pacific Commercial Cable Company,
already placed a contract for the cable
Â¦sv-hich It purposes to lay, and other cable
companies that are not ready to under
take so great an enterprise are urging
the Government to lay a cable, too. Thus
President Scrymser of the South and Cen
tral American Company and his attorney,
Mr. bayless, are pieaaing with the com
mittee to report a Government cable bill;
yet. they were before the committee in

publican coalition had been formed of
contradictory elements which had found
no title that they could avow as theirs.
The speaker dubbed it the "Nameless

name of the faction of the soldier Bou
langer. Said he:
Denounces Foes of the Republic.
The work accomplished by the Legislature

had resulted in a loss to the treasury,
the Premier said that the transitory de

which was due to French genius, were
calculated to overturn the laws of naval
pre-eminence. /y~
The Premier spoke of the development
â¢of the French African republics and said
that energetic action In France had given
French . influence a. new authority. Con
tinuing, he said:
The presence of an Italian squadron at
Toulon has shown that we are capable of in
spiring sympathies, and the presence of the
Czar of Russia at Bethany has shown that we
are able to strengthen an alliance and increase
our strength in the confidence France has suc
ceeded In inspiring:, and In the spirit of equity
which she has shown in all foreign relations.
We have thus better served the interests of
the country than by a policy of bluster, which
is more calculated to alarm everybody than
frighten any one. Other men may have con
ceived loftier designs, but they could not have
shown that good faith of perseverance.
He recalled the sweeping Republican
victory In the municipal elections and
said that the hour for action, instead of
defense, had seemed to have arrived, and
that the Government submitted a pro
gramme of reforms. He said the adop
tion of the law of associations had mark
ed a decisive step forward, Â¦ from the
point of view of economic development
<ind its guarantees of society. Notwith
standing: a prediction of agitation, . the
speaker said, the law of associations has
begun to be executed and it would be
carried out in the spirit in which it was
conceived, without passion and without
weakness. /
New Influence of France.
M. Waldeck-Rousseau declared that
since the formation of his Ministry the
country had acquired a security unknown
for a long time, and that it required an
incurable pessimism not to recognize that
the bad days had gone by. When the
Cabinet took office, he said, the factions
of the party which guarded France as its
own property and patriotism as a politi
cal Industry, the sole patent of which it
conferred upon itself, were prepared to
:t'.surp power by the exercise of veritable
'tyranny, and that within the first year
this tyranny was succeeded by material
and moral disorder.
In the Â¦evening, at a banquet at the, pre
fecture tendered . to the trench Premier
by the Republicans of the department of
the Loire, M. Waldeck-Rousseau, reply
ing to a toust to his health, made the
principal speech of the day. In it he set
forth the position of the Government of
the coming "eneral- elections.
The speech took the form of a review
of the policy of the Government and the
work of the present Legislature. It ex
pressed the firm conviction that the elec
tions would result in a striking victory
for the republic and overthrow the forces
of reaction.

NEW YORK, Jan. 12.â William Marconi
arrived in New York early this morning
from Montreal. He spent Sunday at the
Hoffman House among friends and will
devote the next' two days to business af
fairs here, sailing for England on Wed
nesday, according to his present inten
tion. To-morrow evening, he is to attend
a dinner given in his honor by the Ameri
can Institute, of Electrical Engineers at
the Waldorf -Astoria. â¢ - Â¦â¢ . , '
j Marconi said he was going back to Eng
land to make some further changes in
his plant there for the conduct of experi
ments in trans-Atlantic telegraphy ac
cording, to his system, and that there
would be a resurx ption of the experiments
across the ocean probably within a month.
The next experiments will be carried on
by the inventor on the other side and his
assistants here.
_The . receiving station here : will be in
Nova Scotia, as has already been an
nounced,, owing to the opposition which
the Anglo-American Telegraph Company
has ; raised in Newfoundland. But within
a very short time there will be a station
in Massachusetts and experiments will be
conducted. between. the >United States and
England direct.
. Although it has not been announced
publicly, .work has-been going on for
eight months on a plant for the Marconi
system at South Wellfleet. a few miles
south of . Provincetown, on Cape Cod.
The J'plant/.' if it may be so called, in
Newfoundland, was of a temporary char
acter, but that in course of construction
at Cape Cod will be a stable one. Al
though there Is an Atlantic cable landing
at South Wellfleet, there is no monopoly
in Massachusetts of the charter which
enabled the Anglo-American Company to
obstruct Marconi in the British colonies,
and he said to-day that he expected to
begin operation there within the present
year â he could not tell how soon â and also
at some North Atlantic point, probably
in New Jersey. - +
Marconi said that more power would be
used in the experiments at Nova Scotia
and at South Wellfleet than had been
used for the Newfoundland experiments.
The Newfoundland experiments had not
given him any new ideas as to his inven
tion or discovery beyond satisfying him
that the waves traversed a long distance,
as he had believed that they did. Â¦ Â»

TACOMA, Jan. 12.â Eighty tax collec
tors and other officials in Korea have
been sentenced to death by the Emperor
for a wholesale . robbery of. taxes coilect
ed by them during the last six years. It
is already known that the stealings -will
amount. to at least 10.000,000 yen- and the
investigation has not been finished.
.- In Â¦ their effort to provide larger rev
enues the members of the present Cab
inet, headed by the Finance Minister
Ye-Yoh-Yok, determined to stop what
they supposed Were small peculations by
the revenue collectors." They were sur
prised to learn that the collectors were
regularly pocketing from 10 to 25 per
cent of all money paid them. An inves
tigation of back . accounts was then un
dertaken with startling; results. It la al
leged that former high officials, including
Cho-rveng-Jlk, an ex-Premier, were inÂ£
plicated in the thievery. â¢ Â« Â« Â«Â»
After assembling these facts Finance
Minister Ye-Yoh-Yok placed the facts be
fore the Emperor, urging that a death
sentence be % passed upon ' every official
who has stolen over 2000- yen. The Em
peror's sanction, was given several weeks
ago and the' executions will soon begin

Headache
kills, not necessarily suddenly,
but SURELY. It preys upon the
intellectual powers more than
we realize. It consumes the
vitality faster than nature can
replenish it, and we cannot tell
just "what moment a temporary
or complete aberration of the
mind will result. Headache and
pain should be promptly re-
moved â but properly. Many
pain cures are more harmful
than the pain.. Beware. If
you would be safe, take
mfi.- Pain Pills.

that this department Â«soes not give any

As a matter of course opinions on Â¦*. the issue are
divided.! Some authorities defend them as necessary
and beneficial, while others denounce .them as de
structive and subversive of normal industrial devel
opment. Among those who regard them as evils
wide differences of opinion exist as to the best meth
ods of dealing with them. One set of economists
would have them suppressed by statute; Another
set advocates the formation of state monopolies as
a means of restoring the commercial equilibrium.
The latter advise, for example, the operation of state
coal mines so as to enable all manufacturers to ob
tain coal on fair terms instead of leaving the mines
under the control of private corporations, who show
favors to certain parties at the expense of others. A
third set of economists, suggest the establishment
of coalitions on the part of those affected by the
trusts so as to protect themselves against extortion
or- injustice. By. their plan there- would be organ
ized, for example, a coalition of gas and Â¦ smelting
works against a coal monopoly, a coalition of beet
growers against a sugar trust, and a coalition of
spinning mills against a weaving manufacturing trust.
Dr. Frederick Rose, British Consul at Stuttgart,
has made an elaborate report to his Government on
the industrial situation in Germany, and in the course
of it has given a review of the various opinions held
by German thinkers concerning trusts. He notes, in
the first place, that in his judgment # the depression is
due not so much to a monopoly of manufacturing by
trusts as to over-speculation on the part of financiers
and the recklessness with which banks and financial
institutions expanded their operations during the
years of prosperity that immediately preceded the
present situation. Whatever may have been . the
cause of the evil, however, the effect has been that
of arousipg something of hostility to the great indus
trial combinations of the country, and an excited dis
cussion is going on concerning them.
t-h OR a variety of reasons the people of Germany
|H have given to trust problems more attention
-*Â¦ than has been given by the people of any other
country. In the first place industry in Germany is
more largely under the domination of trusts than
it is elsewhere, and in the second place the" industrial
depression, which has thrown thousands of working
men out of employment, has presented to them as
matters of practical and pressing importance many
phases of the" subject which in this country are
looked upon as subjects for mere academic discus
sion.

As for Mr. Wright's first proposition, it is a< sur
prise to the country that there is not now in the
organic law a provision for the punishment of mem
bers who resort to violence or instigate it. ; â¢ Every
body thought that was the case. The belief that it
was originates in the declaration of labor, that mem
bers of unions never do any of the' violent things.that
mark the history of; every great strike,; and taking
human nature as it 13, it was 'supposed that such ab
stention was = possible only . because the union rules
forbade and punished it. That , branch of Mr.
Wright's proposed reform may be dismissed, and the
whole attention of the public may be centered upon
the legal incorporation : of^the unions. The various
meetings of the different federations of labor, should
attend to the matter and bring it before Congress and
the" State Legislatures/^ \ â¢ >' ' ''Â¦.'- * !
Should it I be that Mr. Wright speaks for the
unions, these propositions are in the nature of a
proposition emanating from them and submitted to
the public for its consideration. The secoiid of these
propositions has been heretofore advocated by The
Call, and we approve it now ! as coming from the
unions. The unions have power, and power and re
sponsibility are inseparable. Much' friction between
employers and employes and great loss to the pub
lic may be saved by the speedy enactment of Mr.
Wright's proposition. No intelligent man can ques
tion.the benefit to the unions of a legal status and a
standing in court which will enable them to enforce
contracts when violated by employers. : Nor can any
ope object to legal equality in that respect between
them and the employers. Both should be free to con
tract, and neither free to violate a contract. ; 7' : -'
In a recent address to the Merchants' Club in Chi
cago he said that the organic law of all labor unions
must contain a provision for the punishment of all
members who commit or instigate violence during a
strike, and that the laws of the country must require
the legal incorporation of labor.unions in order that
they may have a standing in court to enforce con
tracts against employers and respond to breach of
contract themselves. "
MR. CARROLL D. WRIGHT, United States
Labor Commissioner, has been always
recognized as one of the foremost advocates
of labor unions. In his report on the railroad strike
of 1894 he went to such extremes in justification of
that movement as to antagonize the administration,
which put it down by use of the regular army. It
has come to be taken for granted that he speaks
almost as a representative of organized labor, and for
this reason his. utterances have a significance greater
than they derive from his official position.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Otherwise there is little new. The r whole coast
is doing a large business and everybody seems con
tented.
la California, the weather is becoming the principal
factor in trade. We have had a long dry spell at
the very time of the year when we usually get our
heaviest rains, and while no actual suffering of crops
has "thus far been reported, we need several weeks'
rainfall to put the orchards and vineyards of the State
into good condition to encounter the long dry sum
mer. The surface of the ground has had moisture
enough for the shallow rooted grain, which has come
along all right, but the roots of trees and vines need
a good deal more moisture. General trade has thus
far not been seriotisly affected by the deficiency in
the rainfall, and if we get good storms henceforth
it will not be. But unless we receive a copious fall
from now on the quantity and quality 'of the fruit and
grain crops and the . volume of mining operations
may suffer. But this is a bridge still .too far away to
cross now. We will probably get all the rain we
need, and maybe praying for it to stop raining in
another month. '. -.'/:,
Aside from this car scarcity trade is practically
featureless; The bank clearings of the country again
rose last week, the increase over the corresponding
week in' 1901 being 6.4 per cent, against a decrease
the previous week of 9.4, making a net gain last
week of 15.8 per cent, while the business of New
York City showed a gain over the preceding week
of more than $500,000,000. The horizon of the cur
rent commercial prosperity is still unbroken, if the
record of trade last week be any guide. The failures
were 373, against 324 in 1901.
A GOOD deal has been said during the past year
about the scarcity of freight cars throughout
the country and the damage to trade result
ing therefrom, but the real extent of the damage is
only now becoming apparent. The close of the year
is bringing in railroad and factory reports which
show an enormous loss to business on this account.
Large as the volume of trade was last year, it would
have been millions larger had there been sufficient
cars to handle all the freight offered. One Pennsyl
vania railroad has compiled statistics showing that
although 150,000 cars were built in 1900, there were
not nearly enough to fill the demand, and almost all
the Eastern lines received offers of 25 per cent more
traffic than they could handle. The loss to the rail
roads alone from this deficiency is placed at $30,000,
000, and that to merchants, manufacturers, farmers
and the general public must have been much more.
Had there been sufficient transportation facilities to
accommodate interstate business the volume of trade
would have broken all previous records. At this
very moment the Pittsburg district alone is short
-5000 cars, and double the amount of business could
be 'done were it not for this drawback. The Ameri
can steel and iron mills are so full of orders that a
contract for 105,000 tons of steel rails for Mexico
went to England last week, no American bids being
received. The situation in regard to cars is clear
ing somewhat, owing to the deficiency in the corn
crop, and the shutting down of some Chicago fur
naces has resulted in sufficient accumulation of coke
to permit 3 number of them to resume. New busi
ness for the coming year is reported large, and most
of the mills are engaged away abead. Cars are still
being turned out as fast as possible, and in the
course of a few months the railroads may be able to
accept all the business offered. The deficiency has
been common to the whole country, the California
hay farmer, Maine lumberman and Pennsylvania iron
manufacturer having been equally hampered by the
lack of railroad rolling: stock.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
q^ HE British armored cruiser Ba
v I chante of 12,000 tons made a suc-
I- ' cessful eight-hour tÂ»lal under full
'power last month. ship was
down to her intended mean draught
of 26 feet 3 inches, with one-foot drag, and
averaged 21.7 knots speed,, an excess of
seven-tenths of a knot over the calculated
speed, The principal ; trial' data are:
Steam in Belleville boilers, 285 > pounds;
vacuum, - 26.5 inches; . revolutionsâstar
board 119.5, port 120.4; horsepower de
veloped by starboard engines 10,812, port
engines, 10,708; collective horsepower,
21,520, exceeding the, contract by 620. The
coal consumed during the trial was 292,000
pounds.- equal to 1.7 pounds'" per unit of
horsepower.. ; . .
A recent return' of ! the Admiralty re
garding 113 torpedo-boat destroyers In the
British navy gives some highly Interesting
and valuable information. The difllculties
attending the efforts to obtain high speed
go to show that the contractors have lost
heavily and . that the Admiralty has paid
dearly for these boats. Some of the most
noteworthy instances are as follows: The
Express, tendered for 33 knots, has up to
the present time had twenty-seven pre
liminary and ten official trials, and is not
yet up to the contract speed. The Alba
tross, contracted for at 32 knots, was ac
cepted at 31% knots after seventeen trials.
Of the 30-knot boats the Otter had twenty
two builder's trials and eight official; the
Brazen, after twenty-one trials, was final
ly accepted at 29% knots; the Vulture had
twenty trials, the Avon sixteen and the
Bullfinch and Gipsy each ten before they
were finally accepted. The ill-fated Cobra
had no preliminary trial and only two of
ficial ones. . i .
Two small but serviceable vessels in the
British navy have had their trials with
varying results. The Mutlne, a sloop of
980 tons, made 13.6 knots with 1409 horse
power, and the Vestal, of the same class
and size, made only 12.4 knots with 1438
horsepower. A possible explanation lies
In the fact that the machinery of the Mu
tine was built by Laird's, while that of
the Vestal. was constructed at the Sheer
nesss dockyard, which has not had much
experience in this kind oft work.
Oil fuel experiments, have been carried
on .with topedo gun boats and torpedo
A CHANCE TO SMILE
Two Russian cruisers have tailed to
reach their calculated speed. The cruiser
Pallada, of 6630 tons, intended to make

though the horsepower of 13,100 exceeded
the contract by 1500, and Diana, on tht>
same lines, fell short .7 knots of her speed

race several hundred yards ahead* Gari
baldi made seventeen knots with an aver
age of eighty-seven revolutions and con
sumed 1.78 pounds of coal per unit Â©*
horsepower, > and had sixteen of her twen
ty-four boilers In use. Varese was under
similar conditions and used a little, less
coal. The object, to determine the rela
tive efficiency of the Belleville and Ni
clausse boilers, was not settled to satis
faction, j for -while the first named gave,
better results In -work the latter had tha
advantage in the facility with which, par
tial refitting could be made.
The recent launch of the French arm
ored cruiser Leon Gambetta, 12,550 tons
and 24,000 horsepower, took place nlno
months and ten days after her keel was
laid. The vessel weighed 34S0 tons at the
time of the launching:. The number of
working days was 800,000. giving 88J days
to each ton of material worked Into the
hull. There has been a marked Improve
ment In the rapidity of shipbuilding: In the
French navy since 1895, when Charlejnagna
showed 116.9 days to each ton; Gaulols,
launched In 1S96, with 116.4 days; Jene, 89.4;
Suffreso, 82.8; La Marseillaise, 919, down,
to Gambetta, with 82.6 days' labor to eaci*

The gross injustice of permitting such tax shirk
ing on the part of the roads is too "patent to re
quire argument. Many of the farms in the counties
through which the railroads pass are mortgaged.
The owners of these farms are'aware that they are
taxed to at least the full extent of the mortgage. If
railroads were taxed in anything like the proportion
laid upon farms the rate of taxation .would be much
less than it is. . The railroads, however, have been
permitted to shirk taxes, and consequently the peo
ple have been compelled to make up the deficiency.
It is time to put a stop to that kind of fraud. The
people should see to it that this year the Board of
Equalization fulfills its duty of equalizing taxes, and
I prevents the shifting of taxation from the railroads
; to the people. f
That is. the showing made of the value of the rail
road lines by the railway officials themselves, yet the
State. Board of Equalization in 1901 assessed the
Southern Pacific Company's lines at $10,500 per mile
and the lines of the Central Pacific Company at
$17,408 per mile.
The statistics published in The Call were obtained
mainly from statements filed by the railroads in the
office of the Railroad Commission. " For some reason
the annual statement of the Southern Pacific Com
pany for iooi has not yet been filed, although it ': is
due. Consequently figures, had to-be taken for. the
preceding year. * They show that the South Pacific
Coast lines, all of which are in the State of California,
were carrying a funded debt of $5,500,000 and stock
amounting to $6,000,000 pn 101. 10 miles of track, or
$11,500,000 in all, being ari average of $113,748 76 per
mile, as reported by Messrs. Huntingdon and Will
cutt. The Southern, Pacific Railroad Company of
California, whose tracks are, in this Stated had a fund
ed debt of $77,803,500 and stock of $101,289,160, the
total being $179,092,660 on 2690.41 miles of track, the
average being $6^,065 60 per mile. The Central Pa
cific Company, whose productive business is mainly
due to this State, carried. $120,672,986 70 in funded
debt, $79,275,590 in stock and had 1348:66 miles of
track; so that the- average, as stated under oath, t the
statements of averages being made by Messrs. Hunt
ington and Willcutt along with the other figures, was
$148,275 15 per 'mile';? ' â¢
It is known that there is necessary every,' year a
certain sum of money to carry on the State, county
and city governments. If that sum be raised by fair
ly distributed taxes no r man - will f eel â¢ the I burden
heavily; but if one set of men be permitted to shirk
taxes another set of men must make up the de
ficiency/ and upon them will be imposed not only an
undue amount of taxation, but an act of injustice and
of fraud. Every tax shirker cheats somebody, and
every Board of Equalization that permits tax shirk
ing where it can be prevented . connives at the com
mission of a fraud upon the public.: '
ON Saturday last The Calif published a series of
statistics gathered /from 'Â¦ official: sources
which show in a^striking 'manner the extent
to which the railroads of the State, and particularly
the- Southern Pacific Railroad, have, been '< permitted
by the State Board of Equalization' to shirk taxes;
The publication is pertinent to the time because the
period is approaching when new assessments for tax
ation are to be^made,; and it is the right of the
people to see to it that they be made fairly and im
partially, doing injury to none, but justice to alL
TAX-SHIRKING RAILROADS.
In this case the courts should follow the example
set by the Federal courts in the income tax cases.
They should; take judicial cognizance of the fact that
the issue is 'one arising from a decision of a co
ordinate branch of the government; that it affects in
dustry and commerce; that it concerns well nigh
every community in the State; that it is in the broad
est sense a public matter. For those reasons they
should bring it to trial at once. The railroads should
not be permitted to convert the temporary injunction
into an indefinite injunction.
The people of California maintain the Railroad
Commission at a great cost, and for an important pur
pose. The commission was established, in order that
railroad corporations might be compelled to obey
the laws of the State and that all questions affecting
transportation over the roads might be promptly set
tled. If the courts interfere and by delay prevent the
prompt determination of controversies between ship
pers and the railways the commission might as well
be abolished. The courts will. in fact destroy the ef
ficacy of an important part of the State government
if they do not co-operate with the commission in
bringing to a speedy determination all controversies
over freight and passenger rates and other questions
of the kind.
The "Railroad Commission is a part of the govern
mental system of California, and in accordance with'
the principles of constitutional law it is co-ordinate
with the courts. The Judges, therefore, owe to the
decisions and the acts of the commission a deference
due to the representative of a branch of the govern
ment. The decisions of the commissions should not
be set aside for slight causes, temporary injunctions
should not run against them for any considerable
length of time, nor should corporations or citizens
be permitted to profit by delay on the part of the
courts in giving a hearing to any suit arising out of
an appeal from a decision of the commission.
It is well remembered by the American people that
when the validity of the income tax was contested
the courts advanced the test cases under the act so
rapidly that they were -twice heard by the Supreme
Court before a single dollar of the .tax was turned
into the United States Treasury. That incident pro
duced at the time a profound impression upon the
public, and the impression has not worn away. The
people have learned from it that whenever the courts
choose to be prompt they can be prompt. It is, more
over, well understood that the speedy decision given
in the income tax cases was due to the fact that the
large corporations of ' the country desired the issue
settled at once. What can be done for corporations
can also be done for the public. The oil rate cases
do not affect so considerable a body of citizens as the
income tax, but none the less it is an issue which
concerns the community as a whole and has there
fore a right to priority of hearing over suits between
private individuals.
Every day of delay in deciding the suits is for that
day a victory for the roads. .The injunction nullifies
the decision of the Commissioners. It is but a tem
porary nullification, it* is true, but "temporary" is a
word of -very, elastic meaning. If the railroads are
permitted to have the trial of the cases postponed
from week to week and possibly from term* to term
they will have r achieved the indefinite nullification
of the ruling made against them by the commission.
â¢"â¢> INCE the railroad ) companies have obtained
Nfcv from the courts temporary injunctions against
the enforcement of the decision of the Railroad
Commissioners in the oil rate cases, it becomes a
matter of public importance that the issue be brought
to a speedy determination. It will not do to subject
industrial and commercial interests affecting the
whole community towhat has become known as "the
law's delay." The cases should be advanced on the
calendar, heard at once and promptly decided.

Congregationalists Celebrate
Their Release From
â¢ Obligations.
Added interest was lent to the regular
services last njght at Richmond Congre
gational Church by the burning of tha
mortgages aggregating $3000 with which
the church was burdened since its erec
tion. Rev. Philip Coombe, the pastor, of
the church, p^sided at the ceremony,
which was witnessed by a large congre
gation. . . :.
â¢ In his sermon Dr. Coombe recounted the
history of how steps had been taken to
erect a. structure that would accommo
date the growing Richmond district.. -He
said that the old church was utterly In
adequate to seat : the congregation on
many occasions and the need of a new
structure was keenly felt. Continuing,
he said:
' Tha old church was built In 1SO5 after tha
site was donated by Stephen S. Smith. When
we decided to build tha new church in 1809
we were compelled to borrow $4000, and an
other $1000 subsequently from one of the banks.
I have here the . two mortgages which have
been fully satisfied. I also hold here a note
in favor of I. S. Morse. In which we bound
ourselves to pay $1500. Mr. Moras lent us the
money when we moat needed it and now he
voluntarily surrenders the obligation to us.
The note and mortgages amount to $6500.
We now owe to the Congregational Church
Building Society or New York, which has as
sumed the debt, the sum of $4000. to be paid la
ten years without Interest. People have been
very kind to us. Most of the lumber used in
this building waa donated by business men
and we are grateful to them for their gen
erosity.
"I am now glad to set a match to these
martgages," concluded Dr. Coombe as he
consigned the documents to a metal urn,
in -which they were quickly consumed.
Dr. Coombe stated that he would not
burn Mr. Morse's note, as Â¦ It was can
celed and would be a pleasant memento
of the raising of the debt.
During the services the regular church
choir, consisting of Fred Brock, M. Bee

On January 2 Kruse was standing on a

Ward rushed forward and dealt Kruse
two severe blows on the face, felling him
to the sidewalk. The blows were so force

pavement his skull was crushed. He was
assisted to a neighboring drugstore, and
as his condition grew worse and erysipe

Hospital. A warrant for aggravated bat
tery was sworn out against Ward last
Monday and his bail was fixed at $100.
Later the bail was reduced to $5 by Judge
Cabanlss. Saturday friends of the injured
man called on the Judge and made him
acquainted with the true condition of af
fairs, whereupon a bench warrant was i3
sued and Ward was returned to jail.
Captain Seymour was informed last
night of the physician's report as to
Kruse's condition. He at once detailed
two detectives on the case. An effort will

port yesterday afternoon,' having encoun
tered light, baffling winds all the way
across the Pacific Reinsurance on the
Forthbank was quoted at 10 per cent. She
came into port with her flag at half mast.
Norman Shadwick, a seaman, fell into the
sea on December 4 over the port rail. " It
was blowing hard at the time and there
was a big sea running. It was seen in
a moment that Shadwick was unable to
swim. Without hesitation Chief Officer
Paul jumped overboard and soon had the
drowning sailor by the collar. The ship
was hove to and a boat lowered. Just
before the boat reached the men in the
water an enormous wave swept the saiior
out of Paul's grasp. The latter was thor
oughly exhausted by this time. The sailor
had become unconscious and when the
wave carried him out of the clutch of the
rescuing arm he sank like a log and was
not seen again. Chief Officer PauJtwas
rescued with difficulty. Shadwick Was 19
years of age and a native of Liverpool.
Captain Young of the Forthbank is a son
of. Captain Young of the Olivebank, who
is well known in this port. The Forth
bank is the first command of Young the

Heroic Cure for Intoxication.
Henry Baker, a marine fireman, yester
day dived from the float at the foot of
Folsom street for the purpose of clearing
his brain of the fog that had. risen there
from "an overload of city front whisky.
Among the firemen from the transport
Kilpatrick Baker found friends, many
jovial, with money and anxious to spend
it. They bought him all the drinks he
could stow away and when his mental
fog bell told him he was full to the
hatches they were still buying.
"Come on. You can stand another."
"Boys, I'm up against it. I can't swal
low another drop. Wait a few minutes,
though. I'll fix it all right"
Baker walked unsteadily across the
street to the float. In the presence of at
least 200 people he calmly removed his
coat, vest, collar and shirt and shoes and
dived into the icy water. He swam about
twenty yards, then back to the float. He
splashed his face with water and before
'climbing out took several deep draughts
of the brine. Picking up his clothes and
shoes he returned to the saloon. s
"I'll take whisky."
The spectators thought he'd take pneu

acquaintances are longing for invitations,
but they must wish In vain, for only a
few relatives and very intimate friends
have been bidden to the marriage. We
are a little sorry for this, as Miss Morrow
is both pretty and lovable, with a sweet
style of dignity that -is quite her own.
If all the world loves a lover, then all the
women certainly Â¦ love a bride and never
miss a wedding if they can help it. Then,
too, it is not the fact that the groom-to
be is a cousin oflPresident Roosevelt that
makes him interesting, but the young lieu
tenant is a charming man with a mag
netic personality that Â¦wins â¢ friends for
him everywhere. The couple have been
engaged for two years, but, notwithstand
ing her warm admiration for her pros
pective son-in-law, Mrs. Morrow could not
bring 1 herself to consent to the departure
of her last daughter from . the parental
home until Lieutenant Roosevelt suddenly
received orders to proceed to Manila at
once, when the indulgent Morrows decided
to permit the young lovers to marry and
-ail away together on the next transport.
In consequence of this unexpected depart
ure, preparations could scarcely be made
for a. large wedding. -.;., ::.Â¦,-Â¦Â¦;â¢.;%
The Mills tea on Saturday was one of
the most delightful events known _to so
ciety's'devotees for a long time; . .The
drawing-rooms with their decorations
were beautiful and artistic, Â¦ and every
thing was perfectly appointed for the
comfort and pleasure of the guests. Best
of all, the Misses Mills are ideal hostesses.
In fact, they always are and cannot help
it (being their. mother's own daughters).
Nevertheless, we marveled again on Sat->
urday at the tireless energy, the tact,
hand column and the successive tides of the
day in the order of occurrence as to time; the
fourth time column gives the- last tide of the
day except when there are but three tides, as
sometimes occurs. The heights given are in
addition to the soundings of the United States
Coast Survey Charts, except when a minus (â )
sig-n precedes the height, and then the number
given is subtracted from the depth given by the
charts, tfho plane oÂ£ reference is the mean oi
the lower low waters.

tilly lace over white taffeta.
A. G. Gilson, secretary and H. L. Spring
er, treasurer. It has been decided that all
of the local camps shall participate in the
reception. The membership of each camp
with degree teams in uniform, fireworks
and bands of music will meet the visitor
at the ferry, landing, and there will be a
parade to 'the. Mechanics' Pavilion, where
there will be an address of welcome, a lit
erary and musical programme and an ad
dress by the head consul, who is recog
nized as a wonderful organizer and an elo
'quent speaker. Major John S. Patterson
of Golden Gate Camp No. 64 has been
chosen marshal of the parade.
Eleven years ago Head Consul Falken
burg was the only "Woodman of the World
in what is now known as the Pacific juris
diction. Now he is the head of A an organi
zation that' numbers 77,000, of^which 3500
hold their membership in San '"Francisco
camps. .
DUSTY ROADS ANNOY
PLEASXTBE-SEEKERS
TJnsprinkled , Condition of \ the * Park
Drives Is the Basis of Much
Complaint.,
. A chill .wind drove the crowds home
early from the park and cliff yesterday
afternoon. In the city's pleasure ground
this was especially noticeable, and by the
time the band had played its last num
ber there were few listeners left, though
usually hundreds stay, to .the end. V
Those who tried to enjoy the day on the
drives complained their: extremely
dusty condition. The powdered earth lay
inches deep in some places, and as vehi
cles sped along the fine particles clouded
the air, much to the annoyance of pedes
trians. as .well as drivers., Park Commis
sioner Reuben H. LJoyd, however, was
among the pleasure seekers thus annoyed,
and it Is probable that he will take some
action that will enforce the service of an
occasional sprinkling wagon on the. main
drives, especially on Sunday afternoons. â¢
The following named were winners .in
the swimming events " at Sutro Baths,
where a large crowd congregated:
V Sixty-yard dash. Juvenilesâ P. Mosler, J. Mc-
Closky. Diving for plates â J. McClosky, J.

The Father of his Country concealed a
luxuriant suit of hair beneath his queue
wig. Many now wish the old fashion
were in vogue to conceal thinned hair or
baldness. Yet no one need have thin
hair nor be bald if he cure the dandruff
that causes both. Dandruff cannot- be
cured by scouring the scalp, because it
is a germ disease, and the germ has to
be killed. Newbro's Herpicide -kills-" the
dandruff germâ no other hair preparation
will. Â¦ "Destroy .the cause, you remove
the effect." There's no cure for. dandruff
but to kill the germ.
It Hid a Luxuriant Suit of Straight
and Very Dark Hair.

claims he arrived in San Francisco SCO In
debt and gave a bill of sale of the res
taurant to his wife, the latter claiming
she purchased^ it with her own private
funds. Since then testimony taken before
Referee Coulter ; showed that - although
Scharff claims to have returned from the
Klondike without funds, after he Â«rot
home he exhibited $1000 in money, no jn
gold nuggets and his son, a boy of 16
years, also had $140 in nuggets. Â¦. He had
also entered into contracts for â¢ the res
taurant in his â¢ own name, and aflhoueh
his wife Â¦. now claims she -owned the-res

business after his return and paid the
bills. For these reasons Scharff f s petition
for a dismissal of his indebtedness was
denied.

SANTA MARIA, Jan. 12.â The nine
teenth annual trials Â¦ of- the Â¦ Pa
cific Coast Field Trials Club" be
gin to-morrow morning. A large
number of enthusiasts are al
ready on 'trie 'ground and others will 'come,
to-morrow and Tuesday. Only ; a few
members of the Los Angeles contingent
have arrived, and San 'Francisco, is not
represented as fully as she will be dur
ing the next' few days.
J. A. Balmer, who will judge the trials,
and Albert Betz, secretary of the club,
accompanied by several sportsmen; in
spected the grounds to-day. They found
them almost level and covered-. with v a
growth from one to three feet high, af-
good doubles \ matches ! were
played by the â¢ park -players and resulted
as follows:. Smith and Allen beat Walker

and Smith beat Routh and Bozart. 7-5.
A court of bitumen will be. built In the
park. for exhibition matches. It will be
located near the other courts on the south
side of the main drive.

This, with the warm days which have
prevailed for some time, will not tend to
bring out the best work of the dogs. It
may drive some of the birds to the foot
hills, as water on the trial grounds is
somewhat scarce.
The majority of the visitors spent yes
terday in shooting, and all returned with*
fairly well filled game bags. Among
those in attendance are Judge Balmer of

J..A. Tiedemann, Fred Butler, Charles
Douglas. S. Hodge and F. R. Stover of
San- Francisco; .Anderson of San : Jose,
fording good cover for the â¢ birds. - The
only drawback, is the exceeding dryness
of the ground, no rain having fallen for
almost two months in v the Santa Maria

P. Doyle's fast greyhound Liberator
graduated from the maiden class yester
day by winning first honors in the Union
Coursing Park open stake.
Liberator, while he is acknowledged a
speedy courser, has never shown the abil
ity of going through a stake. As a rule
reaching the third round has been hla
limit- though on one or two occasions he
has been knocking feebly at the door.
From his first "slip" the hound showed
he was fit and able to go the distance.
In the third, round he had a hard couraa
with Kosle Freedom, but was returned
In good condition for hla next go. Lady
Newark was. hi3 opponent and Liberator
was given a severe trial before he woa
the hag. With Gramercy, too.^Doylo'a
courser had to do some running and won
only after a big score was rolled up.
Pasha Kennel3' imporied Fiery FacÂ«
reached the final with Liberator. In
leaving the slips Liberator became un
sighted, but after joining in scored the
first working point. Fiery Face took pos
session ana ran up eight points. Lib
erator came in again and held the gama
for eighteen points, when the hare es
caped. The course went over the limit
and three relief dogs were in the chase.
The surprise of the day was the defeat
of Lovlna, the stake favorite, by Living
Picture. Lovina's backers offered 8 to I
that their choice would win. Lovina was
led and made but two points against Liv
ing Picture's eleven.

NATIONALS.
After having the score 10 to 1 In the
sixth inning at Recreation baseball park
yesterday, the All-Americas finally, won
by a score of 10 to 6. Of these ten runs
Davis brought In four with a great home
run hit In the sixth.
On the bases were Pickering, Barrett
and Fraser. Davis picked out a nice one
and sent the ball out to the roof of a
house beyond the center field fence. The
ball bounded off the roof Into the street.
When aU the runners were In motion It
looked like a continuous streak , of red
from first base to the home plate.
The game was remaVkable for heavy
stick work. The All-Americas touched
up Schmidt for fifteen hits, including a
home run and a two-bagger by Davis.
The Nationals are credited with thirteen
hits, Lee and Mertes scoring two-baggers.
. The All-Americas gained their com
manding lead in the third, scoring flve
runs, after two men were out. Sullivan
singled. Bernhard was safe on a close de
cision. Pickering hit to McHale, who
dropped the bail after, a hard run. This
filled the bases. Barrett hit to shortstop,
and everybody commenced to run. Steln
feldt sent the ball back to Catcher
Chance, who caught Sullivan at the home
plate. He then sent the ball to third and
Bernhard was called out. Both decisions
Â¦were exceedingly close, and McDonald
was surrounded by the players of the two
teams. He was kept busy explaining, but
the decisions stood.
The scoring then began. Mercer singled.
Fraser scored Pickering and Barrett with
a two-bagger. Davis scored Mercer and
FraEer with a two-bagger, and Bradley
scored Davis with a single. Irwln retired
the 6ide by forcing Bradley at second.
.. Davis scored his second run in the fifth
and his sensational home run in the sixth.
The Nationals sent McHale home in the
fhird. They did not really warm up to
tfieir work, however, until the seventh
fhning, when they scored four runs. Steln
feldt was out at first.' McHale singled.
Schmidt went to first on four bad ones.
Van Haltren singled, scoring McHale.
Hulen was safe at first. Mertes flew out.
Chance singled, scoring Schmidt. Lee
drove a two-bagger to left field fence,
scoring Van Haltren and Hulen. Van
Haltren scored again In the ninth, but
the side was retired before any more fig
ures were added to the score. The official

TACOMA, Wash., Jan. 12.â The United
States, through the civil. service commis
sion governing the Philippine Islands, has
ordered the construction ' of twenty-one
steamers and revenue cutters in Oriental
ports. Bids were opened in December and
contracts have since been placed. Under
these the steamers will be built by seven
or eight shipbuilding firms of Japan,
Shanghai, Hongkong .and Singapore.
Twenty steamers will each be 160 feet long
and one,' to be used as the flagship of the
squadron, will: be about 200 feet long.
The matter of building these steamers
by coolie labor in Asiatic ports has ap
parently been kept in the background for
fear of arousing opposition in this coun
try. The object, of course, is to save time
and expense by having them constructed
as near Manila as possible.
Specifications wero prepared. curing ne
late fall under the direction' of Com
mander Marlx, " Captain of the Port of
Manila;' who later took them before the
shipbuilding concerns of Oriental cltlen:
Most of these firms had representatives
present when the bids were opened. The
total cost will. approximate 1500,000.,

TACOMA, Jan. 12.â Koyukuk advices to
December 1 have been received via Daw
son. Bert Barton, who reached Bettles
City October 2, writes that a great stam
pede from Dawson' and Nome in the
spring is indicated by miners from those
camps who are rushing in this winter.
Just before he wrote a nugget of almost
pure gold, worth $C00. had been found in
one of the creeks. Barton says:
"Gold is found at a -depth of about four
feet. The first stratum is gravel and
then comes slate bedrock, where *the pay
streak lies. The wages range from $1 to
$1 23 an hour, . but almost every one is
working for himself and It is hard to get
help. Logs for houses are bought and
sÂ£ld for $6 each. There were only 150 peo*
pie in the entire Koyukuk country last
year, but there are about 300 now. ;
"There are four saloons here, one bak
ery and two restaurants. Flour is selling
at $7 per sack, sugar at 20 cents per
pound, bacon at 45 cents a pound, cariboo
or moose meat at $1 a pound, overalls for
$2 50. rubber boots at $15 a pair and to
bacco at $2 a pound. There is a great
scarcity of goods of all descriptions in
this country. Men who get in here early"
with supplies will clear small fortunes." l

The authorities to-day found a letter
which Haenfel had addressed to the Ma
sonic Lodge. It was dated the. day before
the tragedy, which indicates that he had
planned the murder many hours before
committing it. To Secretary J. B. Brown
of Humboldt Lodge, No. 9. he wrote that
he desired that organization to care for
his children and administer what re
mained of his estate. He said his suffer
ing had been great and he hoped the mem
bers would not think harshly of him. In
concluding the note he expressed love for
those with whom he had been associated
in the lodse.
In the room where he shot his wife was
found a small package of letters on which
was written "Keepsakes for my children."
Kindly. neighbors are caring for the chil
dren until something can be done for their
permanent welfare. , >
Haenfel was once a baker in San Fran
cisco. He came here twenty-five years
ago with $11,000, but lost most -of his
money. He was 50 years old and his wife
was 39.
Sherman, Clay & Co.'s to-morrow * morn-
Ing, prices ranging* from 60 cents to $1 50.
Deed Was Premeditated.
The circumstances surrounding the trag
edy were uncommonly pathetic. In the
room where the shooting was done were
the seven children, their ages ranging
from 5 months to IS years. The baby was
lying asleep in a crib in one corner of the
apartment, and the other little ones were
huddled in another corner, fearsome spec
tators of a crime the enormity of which
they were too young to comprehend.
When the eldest girl saw her mother
fall from her chair, bleeding from a
frightful wound where the contents of a
shotgun had shattered her head, she
rushed to the street and screamed for a
policeman.
"Papa shot mamma!" she sobbed, and
then rushed back, to the house. Imploring
the officer to hurry after her. The police
man was-quick to respond to the pitiful
appeal of the horror-stricken child, but
the murderer had been rapid in his work.
When the officer reached the room the
bodies of husband and wife were lying on
the floor. Death had already closed the
story of domestic infelicity, and the little
children were parentless.
Children See the Crime.
It was learned to-day that the restaur
ant-keeper had frequently threatened self
destruction. He suspected for some time
that Mrs. Haenfel contemplated an ac
tion for divorce, and his recent discovery
that his suspicions were not unfounded so
preyed upon his mind that in a fit of
anger he committed the double crime.
EUREKA, Jan. 12.â An overburdening
fear that his wife had determined to leave
him, with the wreck of his fortune to em
bitter his remaining days, and the re
eporfslblllty of providing for some, if "not
all, of his numerous children out of earn
ings scarcely sufficient for his own sub
sistence, were the causes that, impelled
J. H. G. Haenfel to murder the woman
and take his own life last night.

A patent medicine romance ended in a
marriage to-day. Albert Thompson is
70 years of age and practices medicine
in Los Angeles, Cal. In his medical work
he found out that a certain balsam made
iu Danbury. Conn., was a pretty good
thing, so he wrote to the proprietor, who
happened to be a woman. Mrs. Alvorn
Louis*:. Bennett, a widow 56 years of age.
A correspondence sprung up and 1t' eocn
developed that they had interests in com
mon although a space from Ahe. Atlantic
to the Pacific separated them. Photo
graphs were exchanged and they were
engaged. Oberlin was agreed upon as the
meeting place. He came from across the
Oesert and prairie, she from the East.
They found they had made no mistake
and the balsam had proven a wonderful
remedy. They were married in Oberlin
at the home cf Thompson's brother.

in the consideration of Chinese legislation.
A proposed exclusion bill prepared, by

DISCUSSES EXCLUSION
Before an attendance of men numbering
1200 Dr. David Starr Jordan and Professor
Benjamin Ide Wheeler delivered addresses
last evening at Trinity Episcopal Church.
The usual service of the church was per
formed by the pastor, the Rev. F. W.
Claxnpett. Â¦'<Â¦..
Dr. Jordan commenced his discount
with the explanation that what he would
say was not new, but It was true. Ha
spoke of the advantages of a sound and
sober life, of an upright, moral and cour
ageous life. A clean life was a strong
life and those who were weak were so
because they were weakened. Whatever
we get, said the lecturer, we had to pay
for. Happiness Is not got without sacri
fice. He dwelt upon the "short cuts to
happiness," which were a â¢ danger to
man's after life. Speaking of adversity
Dr. Jordan declared that bad luck wu '
the best kind of luck to the man who
could overcome it. As it Is with adversity,
so it Is with temptation. There Is a good
deal in the strength by which temptation,
is resisted. â¢â¢"Indeed," said the lecturer,
"a man is not really good until ha meets
temptation and conauers it."- He spoke*
on the strength to say the word "no" and
advised its adoption, its usa and tha
moral courage to speak the word.. There
was no pleasure in life so great as tha
conquest of evil habits. Indolence
brought with It misery and vice and lead,
to the very reverse of happiness. To thÂ«
gambling spirit could be traced many
evils in society. Â¦ Â¦ y a v-,
Dr. Jordan spoke of the dangers In thÂ«
path of children of the cities, of the pre
cocity of youth in that which is vulgar
and of those who are profane and steeped
In obscenity, both fallings, he declared,
being the outcome of vulgarity. â¢
Professor Wheeler spoke of the moral â¢
man and reminded his hearers that. the
good citizen lived in accordance with the
laws of health and society. What good
was money? he asked. Did they wish to
pile it up for the use of their children
when they were &one. that they, the chil
dren, might lead lives of Indolenceâuse
less and snobbish? Unless used for good
purposes, money was a burden and i
shame. And on this point Professor
Wheeler asserted that no permanent sat
isfaction could be enjoyed in having thÂ»
applause of men, which only begot the sia
of vanity. Â¦ He commended to all the ilv
ing a larger a moral, a healthy and a
beautiful life. "

BoÂ«r Sympatlxizers In Chicago Want
Neutrality Laws Enforced.
CHICAGO, Jan. 12.â The Chicago branch
of the American Transvaal League met
to-night and adopted a petition calling
upon President Roosevelt to enforce the
neutrality laws. A large number of sig
natures of prominent menâ Judges, law
yers and othersâ were obtained. The peti
tion Is in the form of an argument, and
sets forth that the United States is con
ceded to be a neutral nation m the war
between Great Britain and the South Alri
can Republics. It Is contended that If,
the augmentation of Great Britain's mili
tary supplies from the p<jrt of New Or
leans was stopped the South African
war would come to a speedy end. It Is
urged that horses and mules designed for
use in military operations are within the
meaning of the term "military supplies,"
as used in the treaty of Washington- The
President, therefore, is called upon to
strictly enforce Article S of that treaty.
DENVER, Jan. 12.â An enthusiastic pro-
Boer meeting was held at the Broadway
Theater to-night, at which Hon. Webster
Davis, formerly Assistant Secretary of
the Interior, was the principal speaker.
The theater was crowded to overflowing,
and on the stage were State and city of
ficials and many other prominent citizens.
Mr. Davis described his visit to Pretoria,
the capital of the South African republic,
shortly after the outbreak of the war.
and told of his great surprise to find that
a- large majority of the people spoke the
English language, that the country sup
ported improved means of transportation
and other evidences of progress, all of
which disproved the assertions of illiter
acy and uncivilization the enemies of the
Boer race were wont to attribute to them.

These are the last chances to see "Lit

the chance this week.
The Central will put on Augustus Daly's

THE SAN JFRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 13, 1902^
7
This letter was written by Mrs M I,
Upglesion of Post Norfolk. Va. There is
B wonderful lesson that thousands of peo-
ple can learn, that of leavinc off narcotics
and poisonous drug's like coffee and using
plain, natural liquid and solid food con-
taining the elements the Creator intended
*ar man's use.
"I went right to work and made her a
rup of Postum the first thing, which ehe
â¢'.rank and liked it wonderfully welL She
rnade the change and began to improve In
:i few flaj-E. She has Tadually gotten bet-
ter and better, and, of course, I have been
ouch interested in her recovery.
"A short time aso I met her daughter-
5n-.aw and asked her how her mother was
frettins on. She said. 'Wonderfully well.
h " e ls a 'Â«Â» woman, she has entirely
recovered her health and spirits, and Just
to think it was by the simple act of leav-
es off that poisonous coffee and taking
*n Pcstum Food Coffee and Grape-Nuts
Breakfast Food." "
"1 found she was a coffee drinker and
insisted that she quit the coffee and take
Postum Food Coffee with some Grape-
Xuts Breakfast Food. I had gone through
a wonderful experience myself and knew
the value of both Postum and Grape-Nuts.
"The husband sent for his mother, who
was just able to be moved. "When I called
i founi she was suffering from a most ag-
gravated stomach and bowel trouble, be-
ing in pain most of the time, and she
could hardly retain enough nourishment
to keep her alive although she was always
hungry and craving fbod, but not daring
to touch it because of the agony it brought
her.
"The doctors had told her that they
could not give her any encouragement,
that she would never be well again, and in
nor sweet, Christian way she wrote re-
sardirg: her approaching death, saying
she had relinquished all hopes and was
quietly awaiting the coming of the grim
reaper.
A lady in Norfolk, Va., writes an lnter-
<.-tine experience. "Some months ago a
friend who was calline asked if I wanted
t o read a sweet letter, and as I read it she
brushed her tears away. It was from a
beautiful Christian woman, the mother of
hrr husband.
People don't realize what a savage ty-
rant coffee is. It gets the upper hand and
one of the reasons it maintains its power
is that people do not believe that coffee is
doing the deadly work, but they wake up
once In a while.

Until this social reform has been completed
It will never be possible for the whole race
of humanity to enjoy what is possible now for
but a few. The sooner the people, as a whole,
Â¦ waken to the fact that they are still slaves,
the eooner will this present system of govern
ment be changed and thÂ» triumph of socialism
be complete.
Socialism exists to-day to install in the
rninds of the majority this situation of eco
nomics. The day is close by when the social
izing of all public wealth, as the public schools,
roads and posiofflces are now socialized will
complete the most radical change In the his
tory of civilization.

called at police headquarters yesterday
afternoon and notified Captain Seymour,
giving a description of the valise and the
different articles of jewelry it contained.
He said he had always taken articles of
jewelry home for safety. It is supposed
some one had learned of his habit and
had entered the house during the night
and stolen the valise.
