Williams Forcibly Ejected.
Notwithstanding his suspension; by. the
Mayor, Williams went to the office of the
Justices' Clerk early yesterday morning
with a writ of review in his pocket. Soon
after his^ arrival Fredrick appeared,-' and
at his elbow was Captain of Police John
Spillane with a squad of police with in
structions to maintain Fredrick in posses
sion at every hazard. Williams was ac
companied by Attorney Riordan and both
insisted upon Williams' right to hold the
office. Fredrick ignored his predecessor
and turned to Captain Spillane, who a
moment later ordered Williams to leave
the office. This the latter declined to do,
whereupon the officer, deliberately forced
him out of the place. Eight officers were
sent for. and on their arrival the remain
ing clerks, Messrs. McComb, Prendergast
and Wardell, were ejected summarily.'

SCENE IN THE JUSTICES' OFFICE WHEN WILLIAMS HIS DEPUTIES WERE EJECTED BY THE POLICE.
Dr. Arjona, acting civil and military
chief of the Department*Â©* Panama, has
notified the consular corps of the death
of General Alban and his assumption of
the late Governor's duties until a new ap
pointment is made in Bogota. Dr. Arjona
also has announced that the official period
cf mourning will be nine days, during
which national flags will be at halfmast.
Six hundred men guard the railroad sta
tions to La Boca. Survivors of the crew
of the steamship Lautaro, which was
sunk in the naval engagement on Monday
morning, will sail for Valparaiso, Chile,
to-morrow.
PANAMA. Jan. 22.â Official advices to
United States Consul General Gudger say
ths>t Colon may be attacked again at any
hour. There are now about 3000 lnsur
pents In the neighborhood of Paralso sta
tion, near Colon, and squads of revolu
tionists are appearing at various places
along the line of the Panama Railroad.
A-n Attack Is Expected.
So well known is the attitude of the
United States with respect to transit of
the isthmus that the insurgents are not
expected to take any action which will
interfere with it. At the same time the
authorities propose to be prepared to en
fcrte the observance of treaty rights, and
if any delay in traffic between Panama
and Colon should occur marines will be
placed aboard each train, as was" done
recently by Captain Perry, commanding
the Iowa.
Under orders cabled by the Navy De
partment the battleship "Wisconsin, with
Hear Admiral Casey on beard, will sail
from Valparaiso the latter part of this
week. She will proceed to Callao, and if
the situation at Panama requires ths
presence â¢ of another warship she will be
ordered to that point. If not she will
proceed directly to Acapulco.
Casey May Go to Panama.
Consul Malmros at Colon cabled the
State Department to-day regarding the
expected attack of insurgents upon that
town. The Consul is naturally anxious
that a warship be ordered to the Carib
bean shore of the isthmus. Secretary
Hay referred Malmros' message to the
Navy Department^ and the Marietta will
probably be directed to proceed to Colon
In the meantime the Philadelphia will be
able to land men at Panama and trans
port them by rail to Colon should Ameri
can interests in the latter place require
protection.

illss Cleghorn was 21 yeara of age. at

tion.
"When 10 o'clock arrived without her re-Â«
turn her mother became alarmed and
telephoned to the exchange from a neigh
boring house, believing that the girl
might be working overtime. Upon being
informed that she had departed, pre
sumably for home, at the usual hour,
Mrs. Cleghorn waited a little longer and
then went to the exchange In person, to
find that no one could give her Informa
tion as to her daughter's whereabouts. It
waa not long after this that the discov
ery of the body in the lake at Ea3t Lake
Park ended her suspense with the tragic
news of Miss Cleghorn's death.
Yesterday morning Miss Cleghorn
seemed In better- spirits than usual
and remained on duty from 7:30 o'clock
until noon, when she returned to her
home. She left again at 4 o'clock to go
on her "evening trick," which lasted
from. 4:30 to 8:30 o'clock.

this prophecy preyed upon the mind of
the unfortunate girl, and was at least a
contributory cause to her self-destruc
tion. Â¦ y/.'~ :
The third, and probably the most di
rectly potent factor leading to the youn?
girl's death, was a visit to a palmist. This
person, it is sai<l. Informed her that the
formation of her life line Indicated great
danger in the near future and prophesied
her death during the month of January,
1902. There is little cause to doubt that

palmist and a mysterious young man are
three links in the chain of events that
culminated in the death of Miss Kate
Cleghorn, a young telephone operator, at
East Lake Park last evening. The ver
dict of the Coroner's jury, that death was
due to. suicide by ( drowning while the girl
was mentally unbalanced, covers the case
as far as the law Is concerned, but be
hind the conditions thus announced lies
a train of circumstances full of psycho
logical interest and romance.
Miss Cleghorn was of an extremely sen
sitive nature, high ideal3 and unimpeach
able character. Her mind was of a sci
entific turn and she fead much, both of
fiction and of fact,, to satisfy her crav
ings for the occult. Some time ago, it ia
said, she received attentions from a young
man whose identity her friends refuse to
reveal. This suitor, her friends say, pos
sessed many fine qualities, but there wera
some- drawbacks that caused the parents
of Miss Cleghorn to request her to dis
continue further association with him.
The daughter obeyed them and broka.
-with her admirer,- but. -according to her
friends^ grieved secretly over the affair.
Finds His Double in a Novel.
Soon after this occurrence Miss Cleg
horn found the novel which Is supposed
to have formed the second chapter in the
tragic story of her* life. This book shÂ»
read and reread with absorbing interest,
sometimes deriving comfort and some
time bitter pain from Its perusal. Tha

treats of the love of a young girl for a
man whose better nature is dominated
now and then by a hereditary grossness.
and in whom Miss Cleghorn, it is believed,
saw the counterpart of the admirer whose '
attentions she had been forced to forego.
On a page which seems to have most
often engaged the reader's thought ap

"To her own shallow soul there seemed
nothing wider or deeper than existed in
the domain of her sensuous and emotional
life, and she could not for a moment
comprehend how the mortal and immor

CLERK FREDRICK ASSUMES OFFICE
Snook also produced authorities in sup
port of his argument and Judge Cook
postponed the case until this afternoon at
2 o'clock, when he will render his decision.
Ruef then produced decisions from the
Supreme Courts of several States in sup
port of his contention that an instrument
is deemed to be recorded only when de
posited in the proper office; that the de
livery of an instrument at another place
than the County Clerk's office is not legal.
Judge Cook remarked that the petition
was filed before the issuance of the writ,
but Ruef repeated that the paper had not
been properly filed and that his . Honor
had inadvertently issued the writ, believ
ing the petition to have been filed. Ruef
held that it was impossible to do business
with a public official with an office under
his hat. There might be all kinds of ap
plications filed in the capacious pockets of
a County Clerk, said Ruef, who also con
tended that in cases of summary proceed
ings the statute should be construed more
strictly than in other proceedings.
Attorney Snook followed with his argu
ment, in which he held that the law did
not contemplate the. filing of an affidavit
before the order of the court Is given.
"There Is nothing. In the -statute," said
Snook, "which requires your Honor to see
that a paper is filed before the writ is
issued."
"I move that the case be dismissed,"
said Ruef, "on the ground that there is no
action pending. No order can be predicat
ed on a document that is not filed- in the
County Clerk's office. I claim that this
petition for a writ should have been phy-

Fredrick Cited, for Contempt.
At 1 o'clock in the afternoon another re
straining order was served on Mav-or
Schmitz and Chief of Police Wlttman to
prevent the two officials from further in
terfering with Edward Williams in the
conduct of the office from which he had
been summarily ejected earlier in the day
A writ of was also served on
Clerk Fredrick, carrying: with it an order
to show cause why he should not be pun
ished for contempt of court in refusing to
obey the writ of certlorarl which had
been served on himself and Mayor-
SchmiU In- the. morning."- The' oraer was.
If the Justices of the Peace desire to permit
such things to continue I do not hold the
same, and I am willing to go to Jail In de
fense of what I think is my duty to the
people. - '.
I kept my action a secret because .1 had been
tricked once by machine politicians.
I think the people of San Francisco desire a
clean government, and my action in suspend
ing Clerk Williams was actuated solely by the
desire to serve the people. Grave charges have
bÂ«-en made against him â he attended the races
when he should have been working; .Now I
have suspended him and purpose standing by
my action until the lust. ...
When this threat was conveyed to the
Mayor he made the following statement:
Mayor Willing to Go to Jail.
When Williams was ejected from the of
fice from : which he had been suspended
Attorney Riordan threatened to have
Mayor Schmitz and Clerk Fredrick sum
moned for contempt of court in refusing
to obey the writ issued by Judge Cook.
This decision was immediately conveyed
to Sheriff Lackmann, who without desir
ing to take sides in. the controversy, but
to protect himself on his official bond, re
quired the signature of Presiding Judge
Daniels to be appended to all writs issued
from the Justices' Court
"The Justices of the Peace shall appoint
a chief clerk, who shall hold oflice for two
years." â¢ .
Judge Daniels also Issued a statement to
the effect that he and his associates had
elected Edward J. Williams as chief clerk
in December last and they had received
no official notice that their appointee had
been removed. In accordance with the
express terms of the charter that the Jus
tices had the right to appoint their own
clerk Daniels said they would recognize
Williams alone as their clerk.
Court cases called the attention of Presid
ing Justice of the. Peace i Daniels to the
conflict of authority in the clerk's office
and a meeting of the' Justices was imme
diately called to -take. action. Judges
Long-, Dunn, Joachlmsen and Daniels as
sembled in the oifice of the . last named
and the matter was "fully discussed. It
was finally decided to recognize Williams
as Justices' Clerk, basing their decision
on section 1, chapter 7, -article 5 of the
charter, which says : â¢ .- Â» '

MEN OF CUBA
TALK OF TARIFF
Attorney Ruef contended in his' argu
ment that the court lacked jurisdiction in
the premises. He stated that the writ of
â¢review was issued by the- court on the
strength of a document which was never
legally filed in the County Clerk's office:
It appeared that the original- -writ was
filed in the office of Attorney Riordan In
the presence of County Clerk Mahony;
Deputy Casey, Williams and several at
torneys. A few minutes later It was form-

order that the requirements of the law
and subsequent proceedings of a legal na
ture might be complied with.
A large crowd gathered in anticipation
of trouble, . but aside from the furor
caused by the unusual proceeding there
was no great excitement. It was, under
stood that legal steps to resent the action
of Fredrick and j his blue-coated guards
would be taken.' This was accordingly
done, the result being the filing by Rior
dan of an affidavit in which the facts
were duly recited." On the filing of the
affidavit Judge Cook issued an order,
citing Fredrick for contempt, of court.
"I want to show that a policeman was
placed on guard in the County Clerk's of
fice by order of the Mayor. What I want
Riordan wanted to show that Casey was
not allowed to enter the County Clerk's
office until Lieutenant Birdsall had tele
phoned to County Clerk Mahony for his
permission. . When Ruef objected to this
line of questioning Riordan said testily:
Casey testified that besides him In Rlor
dan's office were Lande, Snook, Williams,
Qulnn, Pat Prendergast and County Clerk
Mahony. Ruef drew from Casey that
before Judge Cook signed the document it
had not been in the County Clerk's office,
but that County Clerk Mahony had au
thorized Casey to indorse the paper as
filed.

and afterward raced to the County Clerk's

FREDRICK DENIES THAT HE IS IN CONTEMPT OF COURT
At the meeting of the School Board yes
terday a demand was ordered drawn in
the sum of $440 in favor of Miss J. A.
Dwyer as teacher in the Sherman School
for back salary In accordance with a judg
ment of the Superior Court. Miss Dwyer"
was suspended on July 22, 1901, but the
court ordered' her reinstatement. Super
intendent Webster requested that Miss
Dwyer be transferred to another school.
Superintendent Webster stattd that
Miss K. F. Casey, principal of the Lafay
ette School, had nfty-ttve scholars for
whom there were no seats. She desired to
rent a room hear by to be used for a 1
new class. The matter was taken under
advisement.
The Sunnyslde Land Company notified
the board that the fifteen lots in block 19
would be sold for school purposes for
55250. The company states that the offer
of certain parties to sell the lots for
$3200 is not authorized, as they cannot
give title to the property in question.
The use of the French text book en
titled "La Tour de la France par Deux
Enfants" was authorized in the Adams
School.
The application of Dorothy F. Moran, a
special teacher of sewing, for reinstate
ment was received and the secretary in
structed to ascertain if her statements
agree with the records.
Miss Ruth G. Campbell, Miss Laura S.
Templeton and A: T. Winn were placed
on the retired list.
Superintendent Webster announced that
exercises commemorative of the birthday
of President McKinley would be held in

THE unusual spectacle of a com
mittee of the Grand Jury In at
tendance at a meeting of the
School Board was presented at
the meeting of that body yester
day k It is needless to say that
the curiosity suddenly mani
fested by the Grand Jury in the trans
actions of the board was, in the light of
recent developments at the City Hall, a
painful surprise to the Phelan wing of
the directorate.
The grand jurors who attended the
meeting of the board were Sol Cahen and
Benjamin Lichtenstein of the committee
on education. That they had prepared
themselves for a. warm session was evi
denced by the character of the proceed
ings which followed. Cahen was primed
with many pointed questions concerning
the alleged extravagance of the Directors
in the past, and when he propounded them
Directors Denman and Mark wriggled
painfully in their seats and evinced a for
â¢ getfulness of recent events which might
seem surprising to many. That they did
not desire to discuss the history of their
acts in public was made manifest when
Director Denman suggested that the in
quiry be deferred until more privacy could
be secured. The jurors reluctantly agreed
to the proposition and arrangements for a
â¢ "private" meeting in the future were
made.
The newly appointed Director, Thomas
P. Woodward, took his seat after present
ing his credentials, and with Director
Denman in the chair the business of the
meeting was begun. After the transaction
of some routine business Cahen asked the
indulgence of the board for a few minutes.
Cahen Asks Some Questions.
"What can we do for you, sir?" inquired
Chairman Denman.
"I have a few questions to ask," re
plied Cahen.
"Glad to answer anything," answered
Mark and Denman in concert.
Cahen drew from his pocket a list of
typewritten questions and carefully noted
the answers of Denman and Mark to each.
At first the two Directors were willing
to talk, but as the questions became more
pointed they returned evasive answers or
hid themselves behind the general reply,
"We don't know." Denman did most, of
the replying and defended the actions of
his former associates.
"Have not expensive repairs been made
to the Denman School," asked Cahen,
"while other schools were neglected?"
"I do not know," said Denman.
"Have not certain high schools been fa
vored with more laboratory apparatus
than others?"
"I do not think so."
"With a decreased appropriation from
that of last year, is it not true that the
Board of Education expended $23,000 for
the Installation of a manual training
plant and cooking classes, while at the
same time the board was consolidating
schools and classes and leaving hundreds
of children without proper accommoda
tions?" asked Cahen impressively.
"Say, now, Mr. Cahen," answered Den
man nervously, "there are some of these
things it is better to talk over privately.
Caben was not satisfied, however, and
followed up Denman's discomfiture by
some questions as to whether the State
law regarding the course of study had
been complied with.. Denman referred the
matter to Mark, who replied as did Den-:
man, "Not that we are- aware Â¦Â¦of." â¢ Ar
rangements were made for a future con
ference. The board then proceeded to
finish its routine business.
We will give your committee at any time
all the Information needed." â¢ â¢ - -

"only claim to political favors from Phelan
was that he was a clerk in Gavin Mc-

and City Architect Moser will have to
explain why he advances his private in

and devotes only two hours daily to the
city's business. Altogether times have
never been so troublous as they are now
in the City Hall, and an upheaval is about
to take place which will shake the very
rafters of the municipal building.

A New Catarrh Cure Secures
National Popularity in Less
Than One Year.
Throughout a great nation of eighty million
It is a. desperate struggle to secure yen a rec-
ognition for a new article, to say nothing of
achieving popular favor, and yet within one
year Stuart' 8 Catarrh Tablets, the new catarrh
cure, has met with such success that to-day It
can be found in every drug store throughout the
United States and Canada.
. To be cure, a large amount or advertising â¢was
necessary in the first Instance to bring the rem-
edy to the attention of the public, but every one
familiar with the subject knows that acÂ»er Us-
ing alone never made any article permanently
successful. It must have in addition abso-
lute, undeniable merit, and this the new ca-
tarrh cure certainly possesses m a marked de-
gree.
Physicians, who formerly depended upon in-
halers, sprays and local washes or ointments,
now use Stuarf s Catarrh Tablets, because* as
one of the most prominent stated, these tablets
contain in pleasant, convenient form all the
really efficient catarrh remedies, such as red
rum. blood root and similar antiseptics.
They contain no cocaine nor opiate, and are
Â»ri\-en to little children with entire safety and
benefit.
. Dr. J. J. Rcitlper of Covington.Ky., says: "I
suffered from catarrh in my nead and throat
every fall, with stoppage of the nose and Irrita-
tion in the throat, affecting my voice and often
extending to the etomach. caueing catarrh of
the etoroach. I bought a 60 cent package of
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets at my druggist's, car-
rled them in my pocket and used them faithful-
ly, and the way in which they cleared my head
and throat was certainly remarkable. I had no
catarrh last winter and spring and consider my-
self entirely free Trom any catarrhal trouble 'â¢
Mrs. Jerome Ellison or Wheeling, W. Va
writes: "I Buffered from catarrh nearly my
whole life, and last winter my two children
also suffered from catarrhal colds and sore
throat eo much they were out of school a large
portion of the winter. My brother, who was
cured of catarrhal deafness by using Stuart' a
Catarrh Tablets, urgea me to try them so much
that I did eo and am truly thankful for what
they have done for myself and my children.
J always keep a box of the tablets In the house
and at the first appearance of a cold or sore
throat we nip It in the bud ' and catarrh is no
longer a household affliction with us."
Full sized packages of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets are sold for SO cents at all druggists.

objected to. .Raker then offered as evi

which the men lynched were arrested,
but they were not allowed to be 'placed
on the record. . The ruling of the court
angered Raker, who exclaimed that the
court had promised on a previous occa

ords In the case. > A bitter quarrel fol
lowed, but it was cut short by the court
ordering: a recess. After' the recess the
defense renewed its application, and the
commitment of Raker resulted.

"Russia has always been and now Is

Russia never had . any intention of par

ceive any proposition having such action
in view. Indeed, we received no informa
tion regarding Austria's alleged initiative

ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 22.â The cor
respondent of The Call has obtained the
following statement from the Russian
Foreign Office regarding the announce
ment made in the British House of Com
mons Monday concerning negotiations be
tween the : powers before and after the
breaking out of the Spanish-American
war and the assertions made by a British
Foreign Office official on the same sub
ject:
Russia Did Not Participate.
The. statement of a promlnefit Foreign
Office official, quoted In a London dis
patch regarding the alleged support by
France of the Austrian proposal, is de
clared to be incorrect. Since France did
not back up the proposal, and the French
Embassador In London confined himself
to making an Inquiry as to what view
the British Government took of the mat
ter, France's attitude throughout was
friendly to the United States, as well as
to I Spain, her. ardent - desire being- to
avert war. She took no initiative in any
suggestion tending to put pressure on the
United States, nor at any time . encour
aged Spain to resist. Her influence was
always directed, In the pourparlers of
the powers, to maintain peace. The ex
act value which should be placed on
Great Britain's leaning toward the United
States can be gauged, it is declared, by
the fact that when war was declared
Senor Gollon was furious, firstly, against
Germany, secondly against Russia and
only thirdly against Great Britain. Hia
resentment . against Germany was due to
the latter having encouraged Spain to re
sist and then having abandoned her at
the last moment. Â¦. \iH."C>

Great Britain's action in favor of the

have released, yesterday, on a writ of

It ' was evident that during the night
Post and his colleagues planned a coup
,which. they partially executed this morn
ing when Â¦ they asked Judge Harrington
to temporarily dissolve . his (Superior)
court Into a magistrate's court to arraign

A storm followed,' Raker asking in loud
tones;
"Is this a Superior Court or not?" j
. "You can call it by Â¦ any vile name you
please," replied Judge Harrington, "and
you and your confreres have said enough
things about it." . m
Raker objected to the remarks of his
Honor, and Judge Harrington arose from
his chair and pointing at Raker said:
"Only this morning one of your friends
said In my hearing" that 'the only way to
settle this ; case was to shoot ;that Â¦ â â
. Judge.' " ."â¢â¢',
-Raker objected to the statement-that the
man who said it was one of his friends,
and asked who made such a remark. The
court replied, "A. H. Ferguson is the man
who 1 said it, and the same remark, has
been made right here in this courtroom
before." ' -' ' , Â¦ .

Later Judge Harrington stated to a

brother-in-law of the defendant, made a
similar statement In the courtroom ten .

responsible for the remarks of outsiders.
The courtâ Well, it was a recognized friend

â¢to throw any Insinuations on me.
The court â Raker, I will tell you -why I have

Spencer added a little coal to the lire
by making an insinuation in reference. to
"the mob of gun-fighters In court.".
The courtâ I can say anything I think right.
I am not afraid of any man on earth.
The atmosphere being , somewhat
cleared. Raker asked if he understood
this was a magistrate's court, and the
Judge replied that it was.
Rakerâ The Supreme Court has rendered a

escape from the scene of the brutal mur- 1
der.
One of the criminals referred to in
Wade's confession, " Kid " Goucher,
has at various times passed as a
eon of ex-Senator Goucher of Fresna,
and the other is a notorious footpad called
"Brownie," who has a wife living in Sac
ramento. About 2:30 o'clock on the morn-
Ing of Policeman Robinson's murder
"Kid" Goucher was seen hurrying down
Market street He turned into Mason
street and took shelter in a saloon.
"Brownie" was not with him. The pair
had evidently separated after they left
Valencia street. Qj.
The police are now scouring the city
and neighboring towns for tne missing
murderers. It is quite probable that (
'.'Brownie" succeeded In getting to Sac
ramento, where he has friends who will
try to protect him until he gets a chance
to get out of the country. The police,
however, are not inclined to believe thai
either of the men succeeded in escaping
from the city, for the reason â¢ that they
had no funds. The murderers did not
raiÂ£e any money as a result of their early
morning 'work in the Mission, but when
their safety depended upon getting trav
eling expenses they would not hesitate to
commit any crime.
Wanted Money for McNoble.
Policeman Robinson was mistaken when
be made the statement that there were
four men in the party with whom he Had
the fatal combat. >-.
About 9 o'clock Monday night Wade, the
footpad who Is now confined in the City
and .County Hospital with a bullet hole
in his neck and shoulder, and his two
"pals," Goucher and "Brownie," were
seen in a saloon In the Mission. They had
been drinking In various saloons in the
tenderloin all day Monday, and by night
time the trio were pretty,' well under the
influence of liquor and desperate enough
to commit any foul deed. The criminals
were hard pressed for money. . George
Mason, alias "Moore, alias Pope, the leader
of the gang of daring crooks, was In the
Stockton jail on a charge of burglary, and
his lawyer, H. R. McNoble, wanted his
fee for defending him. .
"Kid" Goucher made a 'trip to Stockton
last week and visited, Mason at the Coun
ty Jail. The imprisoned leader of the
gang of thugs was /anxious about the
money he was depending upon his three
companions to raise i for his Â¦ defense, c
When Goucher returned from Stockton
Saturday he reported the details of his
conversation with the leader of the gang
to Jack Wade, who was with Mason when
he committed the burglary which landed
him in Jail, but who escaped to this city.
Wade and his . associates are said to
have written at" once^ to Attorney Mc-
Noble, begging him to give them a few
more days in which to raise, the money.
Later they telephoned to McNoble and
told him that they would have plenty of
money by Wednesday. Â¦ -
The murderers were in desperate-straits
and when they went out into the Mission
Monday night they went to get sufficient
money to free Mason at any cost
- Chief Wittman and Captain Seymour
have taken every precaution to prevent
the crooks from leaving the city. Every
avenue of escape is , being carefully
guarded and if the murderers are still in
town they will probably bÂ« apprehended
before the week is out. Prior to the mur
der of Policeman Robinson the desperate
trio made their headquarters in a Mason
street saloon. They have not showed up
at their usual haunt since. Those who
know Wade, Goucher and "Brownie" say
that they had no permanent place of-resi
dence. Wade, who was being trailed by
the Stockton police, was wary of detection
and they changed their lodgings two or
three times a week. .

In his commitment of . Raker, - Judge
Harrington goes back to. the afternoon of
January 14 for offenses committed by the
lawyer. Judge Harrington says that on
that date Raker, in the j presence of the
jury, used the following language: ."Now
you can see where the sympathies of the
court are In this case." Also, on the same
day, Raker refused to permit the court
to examine a document which, the com
mitment asserts, was part of the official
transcript of ; John . Hutton's testimony.
The defense claimed at the time, and does
now, that the document asked for was
private property of counsel for the de
fense and the court was not entitled to
examine it. The commitment continues:
Judge Harrington retired to his fcham
ber, and during his absence - Raker con
tinued to harangue the court. . A deputy
sheriff was finally compelled to order him
to cease his remarks in the presence of
the jury. Judge Harrington returned to
the courtroom and commenced to. write
Raker's, commitment. Â¦ . . ' - ...

Mr. Smith was a member of the Bo
hemian Club. Though a public man in
one sense of the word, he was a home
loving husband and father, averse to no
toriety of any sort. He took only a quiet
part in politics, but on â¢ account of his
high character and eminent qualifications
he was : prominently mentioned for the
Republican nomination for Mayor in 1900."
Mr. Smith was married in 1S65! to Miss
Greene, a Boston lady, sister of Charles
S. Greene of the Oakland Public Library,
and a descendant of* General Nathaniel
Greene of Revolutionary fame. She, with
their three daughters, Mrs. Lonsdale and
Misses Helen E. and Bertha J. Smith,
survives him.
Mr. Smith at one time owned a beau
tiful country .home near San Rafael,
which'he presented to his daughter Ethel
on the occasion . of her marriage to Lieu
tenant Lonsdale, who lost his life in the
Samoan troubles In April, 1899.
Going In first as an under clerk, he
passed successively by rapid promotion to
the positions of head salesman, manager
and vice president and tinally he became
president of the company. Â¦ /
Though always giving close attention to
the affairs of this concern, in which he :
laid the foundation of his fortune, he
was a stockholder and director in various
other enterprises, such as the Figprune
Cereal Company; the Pacific Vinegar and
Pickle Works, the' Pacific Sheet Metal
Works and the Phoenix and Maricopa
Railroad Company in Arizona, of which
he was elected president on the death of
N. TC. Masten some time ago.

Coroner Kell was summoned, but as a
physician was present at Mr. Smith's
death an inquest was not deemed neces
sary. The body was removed to Wood
row's undertaking parlors, where it was
placed in a casket. At 2:40 o'clock this
afternoon the remains, accompanied by
the grief-stricken widow, were taken to
San Francisco.
Mr. Smith's demise was due to paraly
sis of the heart. He had been suffering
from a weak heart for some time, and the
hurried trip after the umbrella was too
much exertion and brought on the fatal
stroke.
As they were about to board the car
Mr. Smith thought of an umbrella he had
left on the train. He turned and hastened
back, running slowly toward the cars. He
had got the umbrella and stepped from
the train when he suddenly sank uncon
scious to the platform. â¢
The unfortunate man was picked up
and carried into Wells-Fargo Express of
fice, where he was seated in a chair; Dr.
D. L. Deal of this city was at the sta
tion and attended Mr. Smith. The latter
never regained consciousness and death
came in a few minutes.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 22.â Sydney M.
Smith of San Francisco died sud
denly at the broad gauge station
this forenoon, shortly after he
. .had alighted from a train from
the metropolis. Mr. Smith, accompanied
by Mrs. Smith, had come to the city to
attend a meeting of the board of directors
of the Figprune Cereal Company, ln
which he is heavily interested. They ar
rived en the 10:55 o'clock train, and after
alighting started across Bassett street to
take a First-street car.^ It was Mrs.
Smith's intention to stop at the St.
James Hotel while her husband attended
to business affairs. Â¦, "
The first' person wounded was Walter
Pennington. The buHet entered his stom
ach and passed through him. He then
opened fire, and in an instant the shooting
became general. The two Dipper ts .were
standing together and had no chance to
get under cover. Henry was struck by
a bullet . and dropped dead. Antone's
wound is- In; the side and it Is Â¦ believed
will not prove dangerous. Havkvath was
shot while trying to get out of range.
When the shooting ceased it was found
that White and Odom had been killed.
White Â¦ was dying . with his pistol cocked
and ready to fire. -He and Odom were ly
ing close together.' Walter Pennington
was carried to the hotel, where he. now
lies, in a dying condition. His father,
Elihu Pennington, was struck only once,
the . ball Â¦ plowing through the scalp, on
the left side. of his head, i ~ . ' '.'
There was no outbreak until the parties
met at 'the station, where a â¢ large crowd
was assembled awaiting the train. Just
how the affair started no one seems to
know definitely, Â¦ but it is generally claim
ed that the first hostile act was committed
by the Odom faction. - . /
. The case of Walter Pennington, under
indictment' for the murder of . J. C. Odom,
a brother of Milam Odom and a half-;

. As things transpired, Rollick showed to
be pounds.the best of the if our, starters in
the mile selling ' event. . The Burns &
Waterhouse horse, a 0 to 10 favorite, was
slow to get J away from the barrier, but
experienced little difficulty in getting to
the front,.':; defeating .- Decoy with ease.

r "Plunger"- Lewis made a mild' "killing"
over the win of the concluding- race by
his recent purchase, Pompino. The books
laid 4% and 5 to 1, against the gelding, and
with See up,, he disposed of Redwald and
a big bunch of platers without much ef
fort. At post time the winner closed equal
favorite with Pat Morrissey. ; .
â¢ Mountebank, backed from- 10 down to 5/
was cut loose for a- good thing In the
futurity course sprint with. a field of .ten
going to the post, and won almost by
himself. Light Ball, another well sup
ported outsider, beat Harry Thatcher out
for the place. Foul Play, the heavily
played, favorite, got away from the post
poorly, never showing in a prominent po
sition. . . *
: More than likely the major portion of
the bookmakers did not put â¢ in a profit
able day as five favorites came through,
all well played. Neither was there any
consolation for the 'pencilers in the win
of Mountebank for although .it was a
mild surprise the odds against the dut
sider were forced down from 10 to 6. The
track was muddy, but not holding.
In the Point Arena handicap for three
year-olds, over a .mile, the. $10,000 black
colt Corrigan, owned by Burns & Water
house, made his reappearance. Carrying
110 pounds and well backed at 8 to 5, he
was sadly buffeted abouc the first quarter
of a mile. Ransch kept him headed for
the front and he" won at leisure. Milas
Could not untrack himself in the going,
so Commissioner Â¦ Forster secured Â¦; the
place, two lengths ahead of Halmetta.
Redan retired after displaying a neat turn
of speed for half the distance. i
! Frank Phillips' Moabina took the open
ing sprint for maiden three-year-old fillies,
Jlayed from 5 to 2 to. 8 to 5 favoritism,
onnny Woods, who had the mount, took
the lead turning into the stretch and. won
easily, five lengths before Jungfrau, the
Schreiber entry. . Tibs, a 75 to 1 shot, fin
ished third. . Â¦ â¢ iÂ»".*
favorite â¢ for Â¦ the -. two-year-old
dash, yesterday at Oakland j track. After
some deliberation his mount was disqual
ified by the judges; a decision giving gen
eral satisfaction.,- Not that. O'Connor, is
not just as popular as " ever, but it was
plainly, apparent to all close observers
that he had overstepped the limit on this'
occasion in his . eagerness to win. j Duraz
zo,-a good-looking chestnut 'colt_ from
Green Morris' stable, and -10. to Tin the
ring, struck the stretch second to Alta
wan, with Mounce on the 1' to 3 favorite
taking matters quietly in third position.
As Mounce set down to ride O'Connor,
who had now assumed the lead with the
Morris colt, carried Sylvia out and about
a furlong from the wire gave her a bump
that nearly put the Schreiber filly out of
.business completely. Durazzo won by a
length, but on Mounce's claim of foul
was set back to last position. This gave
the race to Sylvia Talbot, with Adiron
dack second and Altawan third.

The San Joaquln Valley Commercial As
sociation and the directors of the Sacra
mento Valley Development Association
have already indorsed the plan of the
State Board of Trade. Secretary Filcher
has spent some time in the preliminary
work, and finds that there is a general
agreement that it is advisable to have
California represented well at St. Louis.
"When the Supervisors of any county vote
to lay the special tax of one cent on each
$100 for exhibition purposes the State
Board of Trade will at once begin to get
up a representative collection for that
county, as the money when collected will
be a special fund, that cannot be diverted
to any other purpose-
Secretary Filcher says that the St.
Louis Exposition' will be the greatest in
dustrial show that the world has yet had.
Experience has taught California, how to
make an exhibition at the minimum cost,
and yet have it very superior. For the
Chicago- Exposition California appro
priated $300,000, and the counties in their
individual capacity appropriated $250,000
additional.' The present plan proposed by
the State Board of Trade will raise less
money than was required for the Califor
nia show at Chicago, but a better repre
sentation can be made at St. Louis if all
the counties take favorable action than
was made at Chicago.
To meet- the emergency the State Board
of Trade has evolved the Idea of asking:
the Boards of Supervisors in all Califor
nia counties to vote a tax of one cent
upon each 9100 of taxable property In their
several jurisdictions. An act of the last
Legislature authorizes the laying of a
special tax for the purpose of making ex
hibitions, and this has left the decision
to the Supervisors as i to how tney will
have thetr counties represented at tha
great St. Louis Exposition.
The State Board of Trade has begun a
vigorous campaign to secure for Califor
nia an adequate representation of its re
sources and products at the Louisinana
Purchase Exposition, which will open
April 15, 1903, at St. Louis. Xo appropria
tion by the Legislature will be available
for the purpose of sending a California
exhibit, as the Legislature does not meet
again until 1903. The time necessary to
gather up the exhibits that are needed
cannot be less than one year, judging by
the experience of the past. One reason
for this is that there is no month in the
year that does not have its distinct pro
duct in this State, and each can be se
cured to the best advantage only at a
certain time.

The attention of the British Humane

the ship in a British port Paul will be pre
sented with the society's medal, a decora
tion highly valued by those that go down
to the sea in ships. Twice during the voy
age Cid Paul risk his life to save a ship
mate and in each case it was the same
shipmate. Norman Shadwick, a 19-year
old Liverpool boy, who was drowned on
December 4. When the Forthbank was ly
ing in Trincomalee, Ceylon. Shadwick
iumped from the wharf to recover a canoe
paddle. He reached the paddle, but was
caught by the current, and played out
vith the 'struggle against the tide, was
drifting to sea when Paul caught sight of
him. In jumped the first mate and after
a hard battle brought Shadwick within
reach cf a line thrown from the wharf by
some coolies. Shadwick was drowned De
cember 4, when he fell overboard. There
was a heavy sea running and the ship
was going about seven knots. Within
three minutes after the cry of "Man
overboard' had sounded the alarm a. boat
manned by Paul and four sailors was in
the water. The oarsmen were unable to
make headway against wind and wave.
Shadwick lost his head and sank. As he
rose Paul leaped from the boat, swam to
him and grabbed him by the collar. Be
fore the boat reached the two men a huge
wave tore Shadwick from Paul's grasp
and he was drowned. Shadwick was" the
only son and sole support of a widowed
mother.

fleers of the Argyll they, make the follow

The trouble on the Colombia, which has
been distorted in the telling into a mutiny,
occurred on New Year's night at La Boca,
where the Colombia and Argyll were both tied
up. One of the Colombia's crew, a Chilean,
went aboard his ship very drunk. Second
Officer Merrick ordered him to his quarters.
The man refused and pulling a knife defied the
officer to do his worst. Merrick called the
third and fourth officers and they put the man
in irons. Three other members of the crer/.
also Chileans and drunk, arrived on the wharf
and made some disturbance. They were locked
in their quarters. The whole trouble lasted
about half an hour. There was not a shot
fired. The Chileans were all at work when
the Colombia sailed two days later..

The New Haven Palladium asserts that wild geese
that went south last fall are already returning north,
and it argues therefrom that we shall- have an early
spring; but after all it may be that the geese have
more sense than the average Florida tourist .and
know enough to get back before they are plucked.
Of 'course that story, like the rest, is true only so
far as it goes. Austrian diplomatists are not likely to
disclose who we're most willing to help them. As a
That much .we know, for it was done in public,
and except for the gratification of curiosity^ that is
about all we care to know. Even did we have any
earnest desire for the whole truth in the matter we
would not pay much attention to the assertions of
the diplomatists of Great Britain, France, Germany,
Russia and the rest just = now,.for we are well aware
that the aim of diplomacy is not to tell the whole
truth. Lord Cranborne's recent statement on the
subject in the House of Commons is said by. officials
of the State Department at Washington to have been
"strictly true as far as it went." The same may be
said of the statements that have emanated from Ber
lin and from Paris.
Perhaps the best and fullest statement we may ex
pect in this generation is that 'which comes from
Vienna. The Austrians frankly admit that they un
dertook to save Cuba to Spain, and that they tried to
form a European coalition for that purpose. Their
story is a plain one. The Queen Regent of Spain is
an Austrian Archduchess. She applied to her rela
tives for assistance and the Austrian court set about
doing the best it could for her. In describing what
happened the Vienna story says: "France was ready
to second the efforts of Austria. Germany and Rus
sia maintained a passive attitude. - Great Britain was
at first disposed to sign the proposed note, but after
a confidential - report from Washington declined
either to sign sifch a note as the Austrian Embas
sador proposed or to take any further steps." Finally,
Austria abandoned her attempts and after the decla
ration of war relied "on the efforts. of the Pope, who
was backed by. the tacit approval of all the powers"
All of this splutter about a bygone diplomatic
futility and all of these professions of friendship for
the United States are made with so much earnest
ness and in such evident belief that the American
people are longing to know the truth that the af
fair is genuinely amusing. To. us the issue is of ho
importance whatever. We are aware that just be
fore the declaration of war the Embassadorial dig
nitaries at Washington, with the dean of the corps at
their head, marched in stately procession and sub
mitted to President McKinley a mild coffer to inter
vene in the interests of peace, and President McKin
ley, with equal mildness, thanked them for the good
ness of their Governments and informed them that
no intervention would be accepted. Then the pro
cession marched out again and dissolved into viewless
air.
EUROPEAN diplomatists have for some ob
scure reason suddenly developed a lively de
sire to free themselves and their Governments
of any suspicion of having entertained a wish to form
a coalition against the United States to prevent the
declaration of war against Spain. They have one and
all avowed that a movement to effect such a coalition
was started, but they deny emphatically that they had
any hand in it, and assert that they refused to con
sent to it. Then in a vague way they intimate that
they could tell who led in the movement if they
chose to do so, and that they may tell if some other
diplomatists do not keep quiet.

INCIDENTS ATTENDING DE
STRUCTION OF TONS OF CON
FISCATED LOTTERY BLANKS
OREGON EXPOSITIONâ J. P., City. It
Is not proposed by the people of Oregon to
hold the grand exposition In 1903, but in
1905, the centennial of the exploration of
the Oregon country by Meriwether Lewis
and "William Clarke, who from 1804. to lSiifi,
under orders from President Jefferson, as
cended the Mississippi River to its source,
crossed the Rocky Mountains, struck the
head waters of the Columbia River, float
ed down to its mouth and explored nearly
all of the country south of the forty-ninth
parallel.'
We repeat there is no justification at all for delay
in this case. No court can justly plead that it is too
busy to give the hearing at once. It is an emergency
issue. It affects virtually all California, and all Cali
fornia waits impatiently for the decision.
Should a long postponement be permitted in a
hearing which is so important as this to the indus
tries and the trade cf the- people, something very
much like a judicial outrage will have been com
mitted against the State- itself. When justice is de
layed, justice is denied. If a decision of the Rail
road Commission can be set aside for weeks and even
for months without a hearing on its merits, then the
Government itself is mocked and the courts become
instruments of something very much like anarchy.
Such, a course means that the interests and the in
dustries of the people are to be kept in suspense for
indefinite periods of time solely, because corpora
tions are unwilling to submit their case to the
arbitrament of law.
No just reason can be given for any postponement
of an immediate hearing of the case. It has been
heard by the Railroad Commission and the com
mission has acted. It is the duty of the courts to give
due heed and recognition to the commission, for, like
the courts themselves, it is a part of the government
of California. When required to issue an injunction
suspending the operation of a decree of the commis
sion it is the duty of the courts to bring the issue to
a final hearing at once. When any other course is
taken the courts lend themselves to the subversion of
a branch of the government which is co-ordinate with
themselves.
The matter is the more urgent because there are
reasons for believing the railroad will ask not for
siight postponements but for a long delay to begin
with. It is said Mr. Herrin has already signified a
desire to have the hearing of the case postponed un
til he returns from a journey to the East, where he
goes to attend a meeting of the Interstate Com
merce Commission. That means, of course, a delay
until about the. end of February as a starter. After
that there will be something else. Mr. Herrin -will"
never be lacking in an excuse for delay.
Upon a prompt hearhrg the public has a right to
insist. An enormous amount of business is at stake
on a decision which will determine to a large extent
2t what price fuel is to be obtained for manufacturing
and other purposes. Great interests of that kind, so
important, so varied end so widespread, ought not to
be set aside for slight causes. It is the duty of the
courts to promote the general welfare. by acting as
promptly as they can in untangling legal technicali
ties that interfere with the industries upon which the
prosperity of the people depends.
The issue is not one of private parties. It affects
the whole community. It is a suit of such impor
tance that public policy dictates that the right of way
be given it over all private cases on the calendar.
The Supreme Court of the United States set a
precedent in giving a right of way for a prompt
hearing of the income tax cases. That high example
can well be followed by the courts of California in
CALIFORNIA is waiting on the courts for a
decision of the oil rate cases. The temporary
injunction still bars the way against the en
forcement of the order of the Railroad Commission.
The railroad has its triumph in every day of delay,
while the loss to the public increases. It is for the
courts to decide how long this delay shall "continue.
They can grant a postponement to the roads, or they
can bring the issue to a prompt hearing. The people
are waiting and watching to see which will be done.
NO TIME FOR DELAY.

. How far such views are correct it is not for us to
say at this distance from the people whose industries
are to be affected by the formation of trusts.
American. experience has proven that it is profitable
to agriculture to build up home markets for agricul
tural products by encouragement to manufactures.
It would seem, then, that the Russian Government
has acted wisely in taking thecourse it has. Still one
can understand that in -a. country, ' whose economic
conditions are so different from those of the United
States a system which works well here might be dis
astrous there.- Up to this time trusts have not in
jured the industrial prosperity of this country. They
are looked upon as "threatening" evil rather than ; ; as
having done any evil. It may be different in Russia,
but it would seem the Finance Ministry has done well
in deciding to .permit such organizations as the men
of affairs deem necessary for their good provided
they do not look for governmental aid nor organize
with an intention to artificially raise prices. 1
The declaration of the Ministry has not been favor
ably received by public opinion. It is argued in the
first place that consolidation will; tend to . diminish
the number of , manufacturing enterprises in the em
pire and thus defeat the very. object of the protective
system, and on theother hand that it will amount
to an injury to the agricultural classes. A journal
edited by the professors of -Moscow University
opposes the whole policy of- artificial stimulation of
manufactures and maintains that , the Government
should first build up agriculture.. "Our export trade,"
it says, *'is wholly agricultural, and to the increase of
such exports our attention must be first directed
rather than j to feverish, premature transplantation of
industries with the aid of foreign capital," which have
no foundation in our natural, social and economic
conditions."
The request for permission to : organize trusts has
given rise to so much discussion that the Finance
Ministry of the empire has felt it necessary Mo ex
plain the Government's on the subject.
Among other things it says: "If our, men of af
fairs, realizing the lack of such complete adaptation
and the imperfect character of their present organi
zation, shall see fit to seek a way out of their diffi
culties by means of co-operative and combined "ef
fort, the: Ministry of Finance will place no obstacles
in that path; but this attitude of the Ministry toward
industrial combinations can be counted on only in
case such combination is resorted to* without either
an avowed or secret intention to raise prices artifi
cially. In'any event such industrial consolidation
must be the business of manufacturers themselves and
must not depend on the encouragement or participa
tion of the Government."
Following the American, plan .the '-Russians have
attempted to diversify their, industries by building up
home manufactures through the "aid ." of protective
tariffs. In this country. agriculture ; : is .rich and pro-.'
ductive. It has afforded -a magnificent home market
for all kinds of manufactures,- and thus the protective
system has worked beneficially _frofn" the start. ' In
Russia, however, agriculture- is backward; .'the. peo
ple are ignorant of : the; best "methods; of farming and
the soil and climate are not so propitious; as with us.
Consequently the manufacturers have had but a scant
market at home andhave had to; ask from:. time to
time further assistance from the' Government. The
stimulus of Government assistance, however, has
only increased the evil, until now the manufacturers
ask the Government for a larger, liberty of combina
tion in order to meet successfully the new. difficulties
that confront them. >, .
BY translating from Russian official documents
from editorials upon : them in leading
journals of Moscow and St. Petersburg, the
Literary Digest has compiled = an- interesting
tation of the trust problem as it appears in that em
pire. The industrial situation is quite /different from
that in the United States, and therefore it is the more
curious that the same problem "should have "arisen in

RAZOR-A. H., City. It 13 not improper
to say that "a razor has teeth,' ' ; for a
razor la only a very fine saw.
It Uiould not be necessary to recall again to the
public ' mind ihe details of that wretched record of
vice, folly and crime, and give once more the names
of the unfortunate victims of a system of gambling
legalized by the <city. The Supervisors cannot
be ignorant of it and ought to be well aware thafa
renewal of track gambling will mean a renewal
of that series of appalling offenses which roused
popular indignation and compelled the closing
of the gambling games. Let the Supervisors profit
by trie disclosures" of the demoralization of the pub
lic service as revealed through the investigations of
the Mayor. That is enough to teach the lesson with
out waiting for crime to come and clinch it.
Not very long ago San Francisco took account of
the cost of track gambling here and found that
the cost included not merely an enormous loss
of money, both public and private, but the wreck of
manhood and womanhood, the ruin of families, every
kind of theft, from petty embezzlements to forgeries,
and crimes of all sorts, reaching to murder and to
suicide. .
The officials, clerks and deputies who may lose
their places because they fell victims to the entice
ments of the track gambling across the bay may ac
count themselves fortunate. They will have lost
little if the loss go no further than that. Other men
as good as they have lost money, honor, position,
hope and life itself.'
The answer to that question can be found in the
past records of the criminal courts, the prisons, the
poorhouse and the Morgue.
Since such demoralization of official work results
from the maintenance of track gambling at Emery
ville, what would be the result of track gambling at
Ingleside?
Track gambling is an evil carries its con
demnation with it/The moment it appears the
watchful eye can perceive the black shadow of wrong
and crime that follows it. Williams is not the only
employe of the city who has been led to the neg
lect of duty by its enticements. The Mayor states
that shortly after he took office his attention was
called to a carload of deputies and' clerks and other
officials bound for the ferry to take the boat to the
racetrack at Emeryville. He adds: "I was astounded
when the names of at least. a dozen on that car were
given me. I was expressing my surprise at the
audacity cf these employes when on the next car an
other group was pointed out to me, also -boflnd for
the racetrack, among them being Mr. Williams. On
the preceding car had been at least two of his depu
ties, and as this was a business day it struck me as a
most outrageous proposition that both principal and
deputies should thus neglect their duties."
ON Monday an ordinance was introduced at the
meeting of the Board of Supervisors to
amend the anti-poolselling ordinance which,
if adopted," will authorize the, resumption of track
gambling at Inglcside racetrack. On. Tuesday Maydr
Schmitz found it necessary to suspend Justices' Clerk
Williams from office because Williams had been
found to spend a considerable portion of the busi
ness hours of the day at the Emeryville racetrack in
stead of in his office.- In considering what they shall
do with the amendment proposed on Monday the
Supervisors will do .well to heed the significance of
the Mayor's action on Tuesday.

.-â¢ The forthcoming Juvenile Fairyland
Carnival being of ; the nature of the
"Brownies", and similar spectacular pro
ductions, and also. being given in the Pa
vilion on a special stage with hundreds of
little children 1 around, has resulted in
many remarkable discoveries of extraor
dinary'histrionic ability among juveniles.
Some three hundred children take part In
this carnival, and among them are very
extraordinary: performers on musical' in
struments, some little dancers. of national
dances, such as. Scotch,- Irish and Spanish
dances, who would be considered phenom
enal on the best professional stages in
the United States.' There are also some
very remarkable performers on the piano,
who will make a name anywhere.
The Juvenile Fairyland Carnival opens
on February 8 and continues until Feb
ruary 15 in the big Pavilion. There will
be a number of society days and special
days for the Orphan Asylums of the city
and the i children will be admitted free.

John Ivans, stage robber, thanked United
States District Judge de Haven yester
day for sentencing him to six years' im
prisonment in the penitentiary at San
Quentin on an indictment charging him
with robbing a carrier of United States
mails. Ivans pleaded guilty a few days
ago. * He contended all along that the
gun with which he held up the Mendoclno
stage near Ukiah was not loaded, and
this fact might have some weight with a
jury if he had stood trial in a State
court. . "> â¢
Stage Robber Goes to Prison.
At that hour all parties were in court,
and the scene that ensued was at times
dramatic. The divorced wife showed that
she hated the present wife, who is n
quiet, ladylike woman,- and when Arguello
said that if- he had the intention of ab
ducting the girl he would have waited till
a steamer was leaving for Central Amer
ica the divorced wife cried out, "Ha, ha!
He- has shown his hand now," and burst
into a hysterical fit of laughter. The
Judge continued the case till to-day and
allowed Mrs. Arguello to go on $25 bail,
and fixed Arguello's bonds in $500 or $100
cash. . ; Â¦. â¢ " Â¦,.-Â¦Â¦-
Julius P. Arguello, for whose arrest a
warrant was issued Tuesday on a charge
of. abduction, walked into Judge Cabaniss*
court yesterday morning, leading his
daughter, Claire, by the hand. He was
accused by his divorced wife of abduct
ing the little girl, who was given into the
custody of the mother when the decree
was granted about two years ago.
Arguello denied that he had abducted
the girl, and stated that, seeing her almost
shoeless and wearing clothes that were
shabby, he and his present wife took her
with them to their notne and bought her
a new outfit. He telephoned to nis for
mer wife, telling her wnere the child was
and that she would stop at his house all
night. The little girl denied to the Judge
that her father had abducted her and
seemed to be very fond of. him. The
Judge told Arguello to return In the aft
ernoon at 3 o'clock wtih his wife, who
was included, in the charge, and he noti
fied the other parties to be there at the
same time. ' , . Â¦ .

Dramatic Scene in the Police Courc
Alice Edith Dickason Blythe Is
) Cross-Examined at Length by
Attorney Hart.
The cross-examination of Alice Edith
Dickason Blythe was resumed yesterday
in Judge Hunt's-court by William H. H.
Hart, attorney for Mrs. Florence Blythe
Moore. The witness was placed on the
stand Tuesday by Attorney William T.
Baggett, who represents Hiram A. Un
ruh, who has sued the heiress to the
Blythe millions for possession of property
deeded to him by Alice Edith Dickason
Blythe.
Quite a little furor was created at the
morning session when Attorney Baggett
presented the witness with a bunch of
violets to sustain her during the rigid ex
amination. He apologetically stated that
the witness was addicted to fainting spells
and the' odor of violets always gave her
strength.
As the witness' feet could not reach the
floor by reason of the height of the wit
ness chair, the attorney for Unruh sug
gested that the clerk place a large book,
before her that she might use it as a has
sock. Attorney Hart suggested that the
box used for impaneling a jury be used,
as the trial of this case would last until
next vacation. He later stated that the
case would take many months, as the en
tire Blythe case would be reopened.
Alice Edith was under a cross-fire of
questions all day. She was asked par
ticularly about her studio in the Blythe
block. It developed that the rooms were
opposite the offices of the millionaire and
were located on the third floor. The wit
ness testified slje had a number of pupils
but could not remember their names By
dint of hard questioning Attorney Hart
learned that one of her scholars was a
Mrs. Guttierez, who was then a Miss San
chez of Los Angeles. She stated she In
troduced Mrs. Guttierez to Blythe The
attorney for the defendant tried to learn
from the witness what sign she had on
her door, but the witness could not re
member.
Walsh Still Leads Alpers.
Edwin J. Walsh, candidate for Super
visor on the Labor party ticket, continues
to gain over Supervfsor-elect Alpers. His
net gain yesterday was seven votes.- To
date he leads Alpers by twenty, votes
When he started in he was forty-six votes
behind Alpers.' In the recount yesterday
the Democratic candidates for Supervisor
lost twenty-five votes apiece in the Alms
house district. The voters In all instances
marked their ballots incorrectly. On the
day's count Alpers lost eighteen votes and
\\ alsh eleven, giving the latter a net gain
of seven votes for the day. -
' Customs Surveyor Spear filed a com
plaint yesterday with the Collector against
Moses S. Blackburn, the watchman em
ployed by. the Government and detailed
on guard at the point where the coolie
walked out. Blackburn will be called
upon to explain why he allowed the im
migrant to pass unchallenged, or why he
v- as absent. from his post. ,
A Chinese immigrant in transit to Mex
ico and , confined in the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company's detention shed
made his escape last Tuesday between
noon and 1 p. m. The escape showed re
markable astuteness on the part, of th-Â»
immigrant. Heretofore the score or more
of Chinese immigrants who escaped from
the' shed made their exeunt from the sky
lights or the windows and lowered them
selves from the roof by means of ropes.
But this ( transitory coolie disdained to
lower his dignity by breaking through a
skylight and climbing barbed wire fencos
in the midnight gloom. He simply walked
down the main stairway like a gentleman
and took a street car for Chinatown. The
simplicity -of this manner- of landing in
the country without the aid of the Chi
nese Bureau is the subject; of universal
admiration in Chinatown.

The Hofmanrr piano recitals, that will
take place on Tuesday and Friday after
noons of next week at the Columbia
Theater, are creating a great deal of at
tention. The advance sale of seats began
on Monday last at Sherman & Clay Hall
and the sale promises an exceptionally
large attendance. Mr.. Hofmann make's
his first appearance here, and the event
is one of the first musical importance.
The sale of seats for the se'eond series
of symphony concerts, to be given at the
Grand Opera-house under the auspices of
the San Francisco Symphony Society, Is
progressing briskly and shows consider
able improvement over the sale for th<Â»
last season. Director Paul Steindorff Is
hard at work with his capable orchestra
with Giulio Minetti as concertmeister, and
he is confident that the forthcoming con
certs will be Â¦Â¦" an* artistic success. ' The
subscription list will remain open at Sher
man, Clay & Co.'s until the end. of the
week, and next Tuesday the sale of seats
for single concerts will begin. The first

her bicycle.
George E. English, a commission mer
chant, living at 2417 Howard street, testi
fied that he saw a man knock Rice down,
after which another man fired four shots
at the fallen machinist. The defendant
was pointed out to the witness, but lie
could not say positively that he was ths
man who had done the shooting.
Louis R. Levy was on the car on the
night of the tragedy, and when he heard
the shooting he left the car and saw two
men' .running down Twentieth street to
ward Shotwell. On the following day he
identified Buckley as one of the men
who ran from the scene of the crime.
Witnesses will be produced to-day who
will positively identify the defendant ns
the man who shot Rice. The testimony
will also show that the murder of Rice
was deliberately planned and executed.
Dr. Thomas D. Maher, resident physi
cian of the County Hospital, next testi
fied to the fatal character of Rice's
wounds. He was present when Buckley
was placed before the dying man for
purposes of identification, but the latter
could not identify the defendant as his
assailant. All he knew was. that the man
who shot him wore a white hat.
Rice was on his way home and had
just alighted from a Howard-street car
at the crossing of Twentieth street, when
Moran, it is claimed, sprang from the
same car and knocked him down with a
club. Buckley, the prosecution allege!*,
then 'approached from the other side of
the car and shot the half-unconscious
machinist three times. Inflicting wouna.s
which resulted In his death at the County
Hospital the following morning.
Buckley was represented by Attorneys
Ferral and Murphy, and the interests of
the people were in the hands of Assistant
Prosecuting Attorney Alford and Attor
ney Peter F. Dunne. The first witnedd
called was George W. Russell, draugnts
man of the Police Department, who ex
plained a diagram of the scene of tno
muraer.
The trial of William Buckley, who, with
Thomas Moran, Charles Donnelly and
Edward Duncan, is charged with the
murder of George W. Rice, a non-union
machinist, on the evening of October 11
last, was begun before a Jury in Judge
Lawlbr's court yesterday. No matter
what the verdict of the Jury in Buckley's
case may be, the trials of the other de
fendants will follow in quick succession.
Bert Parker thinks, according to let
ters written to Treadwell, that a woman
named Sadie Ward, who used to live on
Bouldin Island, may. have abducted the
child, as she was very fond of her. He
also suspects Mrs. Ed Dean, wife of tha
engineer of the steamer T. C. Walker, of
knowing something about the where
abouts of Ida. He will give a liberal re
ward to any one giving information that
will lead to her recovery. Ida was II
years old last August, has blonde hair
and. a very pale clear skin. Another
person whom Parker . suspects is John
Breslin, whose wife keeps a lodging-house
somewhere in : this city. He had been
trying to get possession of the child for
some time.
Treadwell alleges that he saw both the
matrons at the City Prison and neither
remembered of any little girl being placed
in their charge by Kane about that time.
He also alleges that the police deny 'that
Kane ever mentioned the matter of the
girl's disappearance to them. He says as
win. apply tor another writ of habeas
corpus to compel Kane to tell what he
knows in court about the girl.
j^arKer ttien employed 'l'readwell to find
out what Kane nau done witn tne child,
and Jureadweli says' that when he saw
Kane ne was tola that tne cniiu had been
stolen from him by some woman. : tie
had left tne child with one of the matrons
in the City Prison tiil he^went to the City
Hau to apply tor guardianship papers,
and during nis absence a woman had
caued to see the cmla, saying tnat Kane
had sent her. The woman kissed the
child and talked with her tor some time.
Next day the child disappeared. When
Kane was asked why he nad taken the
girl from her mother he replied that he
old it from notification received, but de
clined to give its nature. He said he had
notified the police of the little girl's ab
duction, but.no trace of her could be
found.
The child is Ida Parker, 11 years of age,
and her mother is the wife of Bert Par
ker, son of R. B. Parker, grocer, Center
and Lafayette streets, Stockton. The lit
tle one took Parker's name after her
mother's marriage to him. It is alleged
that while Mrs. Parker was visiting
friends at Clay and Powell streets, in
this city, about seven weeks ago with the
little girl Kane came into the house and
announcing his 'name and showing his
star said he would take care of the child.
The mother protested, but Kane took the
child away. A writ of habeas corpus
was sued out by a lawyer from Stockton,"
but service could not be made upon Kane
lor a month, as he could not ue found,
and the writ was dismissed.
:. A most remarkable case of the disap
pearance or abduction of a little girl was
brought to the attention of Police Judge
Conlan by ex-Judge Treadwell yesterday.
It places Frank J. Kane of the Pacific
Coast Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Children in a peculiar light.

Benjamin Ide Wheeler, president "of the
State University, mentioned that Gov
ernor Taft was engaged in the largest ed
ucational enterprise in the worldâeduca
tion in the highest sense. He gloried m
what the commission had done in quick
ening the sense of responsibility in the
Filipino mind. It was right to hold back
the arm of force to quicken this sense.
The danger Is that people of their tradi
tion will lose sight of government. It is a
fault of the Spanish' that they are bad
losers and that the minority falls to ac
cept the judgment of the majority. Presi
dent Wheeler fancied that such an object
lesson as Governor Taf t's daily life af
forded was just what the Filipinos needed.
Colonel Jesse B. Fuller, secretary of the
league, presented the merchants and ota
ers to the distinguished guest.
General James F. Smith, responding to
a call for a speech, said he had nothing to
offer beyond the suggestion that the op
portunity had arrived for spreading the
gospel of liberty and that the time' was at
hand for giving the Filipinos as large a
measure of liberty as they were capable
of â¢ using.
In closing his remarks Governor Taft
said his armor was still on, and probably
would be worn for two years. When it
was laid aside he might speak with great
er freedom. He again assured his hearers
that the outlook for the adjustment of af
fairs on the lines of peace and prosperity
was encouraging. The Governor re
marked that he would return from the
East in two months. His speech was
warmly applauded.
General W. H. L. Barnes, being re
quested by President Pippy to speak, re
ferred to the difficult work accomplished
by; the commission in its dealings with
people whose thought was hostile to ours.
He remarked that the people here did not
believe the . reports that the commission
was fifty years ahead of time and that
guns only were needed to govern the Fili
pino. In closing his brief speech General
Barnes mentioned the loss sustained by
the country in the death of President Mc-
Kinley, and pathetically described the la
mented President's prolonged sojourn in
San Francisco.
We desire to run a good government in the
Philippines. It is true that the money could
be appropriated from the' United States Treas
ury- to meet the expenses of government, but It
is better that the Filipmcs should I pay. A
great deal ol misinformation is brought here
by people who have only seen one town in the
Philippines. Busy Americans hardly take time
to compare geographical facts with historical
facts. Â¦ Â¦ It is said that the people of the United
States know very little about the Philippines,
and "possibly this Is true. I know that my
geographical knowledge was limited. The sit
uation is difficult to describe, but it is plain
that the progress of civilization in the Phil
ippines will redaund greatly to the commer
cial benefit of California.,
At. the. Union League Club yesterday
afternoon Governor W. H. Taft met many
representative citizens- ok San Francisco.
The occasion was a recepuon in his honor
tendered by the lague- Colonel George H.
Plppy. president of the club, introduced
the distinguished Governor of the archi
pelago. In responding to the happy intro
duction Governor Taft 'expressed his
thanks, for the kindly greeting. He re
marked that the, relation of California to
the' Philippines was so close that Califor
nians would be something, other than
human if they did not take an interest in
affairs relating to ; the islands. The chief
difficulty he found in working for . the
American public was a desire of the peo
ple jj that everything should be done ; at
'once. The problems In the Philippines, he
said, were not capable of instant' solution.
Still he was much encouraged, and re
marked that the prospects of peaceful and
permanent adjustment were never brignt
er. Continuing he said:
the Islands.

A ladies' skating match and the ama
teurs in a new bill are the special attrac
tions at the Chufes and Zoo to-night.
GAVE WITNESS VIOLETS
TO PREVENT FAINTING
The Da Coma family of men and women
acrobats is causing a furor at the Or
pheum this week. The Taylor twin sisters
give a unique skating act, and Ada Ar
noldson, the Swedish sweet singer, re
ceives several encores at every perform
ance. Besides these are Kara, the great;
Mr. and Mrs. Gardner Crane in "Am I
Your Wife?"; Jacques Inaudi, the light
ning calculator; Arthur Buckner, the
trick bicyclist; the three Faust sisters,
acrobatic dancers, and the biograph. Next
week comes the great "cycle whirl," and
Josephine Sabel, the "little woman with
the big voice."
The Central has its usual kind of good
bill In "The Fire Patrol." The melodrama
is as stirringÂ«as they make them and is
full of thrilling incident and picturesque
effects. The cast is comprised of the best
Of the Central Stock company, who till all
necessary requirements, and the me
chanical and electrical effects are unusu
ally startling. Next week another mys
tery story will be put on, entitled "A Man
of Mystery." . .
"For the White Rose" is running still at
.the Alcazar to good houses. The play has
found favor with the patrons of the house
and will remain the attraction up to and
including Sunday night. Next week a new
farce, on the order >of those in which the
clever company at the Alcazar has done
such good work, will be put on. It is
called "Coralie & Co., Dressmakers."
The Grand Opera-house has an excel
lent attraction this week in Edwin Arden
in the - Salvini version of "Don Caesar de
Bazan." Mr. Arden has made a pleasing
success in the name role and has proved
himself an actor of exceptional achieve
ment. He is, well supported by the house
company, particularly by Herschel May
all, who has a part that suits him admir
ably in Don Jose, and takes full
advantage of its opportunities. Laura
Nelson HalWs also^ pleasing, and the rest
of the cast more than usually effective.
Next week Mr. Arden's play "Zorah" will
be put on.
"The Toymaker" will hold the boards
for this week only at the Tivoli, which is
all too short a time for the pretty opera.
As before/ the Toymaker will make a
present of a toy from his store to each
child, attending the Saturday matinee.
Next week the opening proper of the reg
ular comic opera season takes place, with
Frank . Daniels' great success "The
Ameer" as the bill. The new and old
stars of the season, Anna Lichter, who
arrived here on Tuesday after, an absence
of two years; mostly spent in study, in
Germany, Frances Graham, Annie Myers,
Harold Gordon, Arthur Cunningham, Ed
ward Webb, Ferris Hartman and Harry
Cashman, will all make their appearance
and inaugurate a season that promises to
be one of the most successful that the
popular house has ever had.
."The Princess Chic" is proving a decided
success at the Columbia Theater, -where
it will remain all of this and next week.
The music of the work is bright, .catchy
and well rendered by the large company
of talented singers. Maude Lillian Bern,
who beads the company, gives an excep
tionally interesting and effective portrayal
of the title rple, and is ably assisted by
Hubert Wilke, Walter A. Lawrence, Fred
erick Knights, Thomas C. Leary, Edward
S. Metcalte, Neil McNeil, Dorothy Hunt
ing, Edna Floyd and others. "The Prin
cess Chic" will be presented every night,
including Sundays. t The next attraction
for the Columbia is one of special import
ance, as it is none other than Viola Al
len in her successful production of the ro
mantic play "In the Palace of the King."
Miss Alien is a favorite here, and will no
doubt be warmly welcomed by the play
going public. ' â¢

Leo Nielsen of Berkeley
Pound in Chicago by
Detectives.
Haley Makes Confession' of
His Perfidy to the 0:
Officers."
Special Dlssatch to The Call.
. CHICAGO, Jan. 22.â Leo Nielsen, the
Berkeley. Cal.. girl who mysteriously dis
appeared from her home last November
in company with C. E. Haley, a married
man. has been located by detectives in a
Dearborn avenue lodging-house in :this
city. She has been restored to her sister,
Mrs. Howard Linsley, who came East re
cently for tlje purpose of finding the de
luded young lady and acquainting her
with Haley's rascality. The two women
left for San Francisco- on the evening
trainl Â¦
Miss Nielsen was prostrated when she
learned of tlie true state of affairs, and
refused to allow Haley to see her. It waÂ»
learned from the girl that her supposed
husband had told her that he had been
divorced from his wife. They went to
Reno, Nev., and were married, as she sup
posed. They then left for this city, where
he secured a position as stenographer in
the office of a well-known drygoods firm.
She stated that he had been j very kind
to her, but that she had been greatly
troubled because of his desire to keep
their movements secret. Nevertheless she
had reposed the greatest confidence In his
representations, and the shock of dis
covery rendered her nearly insane.
The papers in a suit for maintenance
brought by Haley's real wife were served
on the deceiver, and he broke down com
pletely, making a free confession of his
crime. Mrs. Linsley states that the fam
ily does not intend to prosecute Haley,
and his wife, it is said, is willing to let
the matter drop provided he doesn't ap
pear in California again. It seems prob
able therefore that the young criminal
will be allowed to go unpunished. He is
said to belong to a prominent family in
Berkeley, Cal.
Mrs. Nielsen, the girl's mother, was
overjoyed when Informed that her daugh
ter had at last been found and would
soon be home. She says that Investiga
tions have resulted in the discovery that
the alleged marriage at Reno, Nev., was
a fake, pure and simple, intended merely
to deceive the young lady. v

Exciting' Experience of Sirs. G.
Rapp in Her Home on Howard
Street.
Mrs. G. Rapp, 834 Howard street, had
an exciting encounter with a burglar
Tuesday afternoon. She had been out
for a few moments and when she re
turned she was surprised to see a man
in one of the rooms.
"What are you doing here?" she asked.
The man, with an oath, sprang at her,
and grabbing her by the throat, threat
ened to kill her if she made an outcry.
She screamed for help and the man threw
her against the wall and ran out of the
front door. He had evidently effected an
entrance by means of a false key.
Mrs. Rapp reported the matter to the
police and described the burglai> He did
not have time to take anything.

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
CHICAGO, Jan. 22. â Business in tha wheat
pit was only fairly active to-day. Traders
were at a- loss to know which side of the mar
ket to espouse and as a result fluctuations were
as frequent as conflicting news came to hand.
At the outset cables were slightly: lower and
showed a tendency to follow the strength ex
hibited here yesterday. On other bearish news,
such as rains in California, promised snow in
the Southwest and hesitation in corn and oats,
May wheat opened easy. Vi@%c to %@V4c lower
at 79%c to 7914c. The coarse grains also felt
somewhat easy later, when wheat reflected
their condition. Denials came to yesterday's
rumor that frost . had damaged the Southern
Russian crop. â¢ Sellers were prominent for a
short time, but the low prices Induced liberal
covering of the large short accounts and May
wheat went to 79;&c. Scalpers jumped into the
pit at every dip and helped a little to strength
en the market. Just when the traders began to
say that shorts had covered everything out
standing and that the market was in danger of
turning weak at 79VsC bullish news arrived
from the Southwest. Oklahoma wired that,
there had been no relief from the drought and
May sold up to 79%c, closing steady, a shade
higher, at 79%c.
Corn had only a fair trade and in the main
waited on wheat. May closed steady, a shade
lower, at O4?4c.
Oats were dull. May closed a shade lower at
46%c.
Provisions were weak on heavy hog receipts
and commission house selling. There was' some
covering by shorts on the breaks, but May pork
closed 25@27V4c down, lard 10c lower and ribs
7M:@lCc depressed. . â¢

Nezu York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Jan. 22.â The professional
operators in the market made an upward turn
of prices again to-day. The dullness of the
market and the congestion of the scanty deal
ings into a few stocks clearly reflected the
continued indifference of the outside public to
the securities market and the abstention of
the great banking interests which made the
great bull markets of last year from any hand
in the trading. Such narrow price movement
&s there was was pretty much wiped out j in
the closing dealings and many, stocks closed
below last night. Metropolitan Street Rail
way was the central feature and moved up
late in the day an extreme of S'i. on a volume
of dealings very unusual for that stock. The
gain of the day was 2%. Many rumors circu
lated to explain the movement, which was in
general agreement as to coming issue of stock
with subscription' rights to stockholders, but
which varied greatly as to the use to be made
of the proceeds of the stock sale. There was
talk of a C3nsolidation of all New Tork public
utilities and of a centralization of the pro
duction of electric power for the benefit of all
at them. The stock of other New York public
utilities did not fully sympathize, and reacted
sharply at the last. Advances of 5 points eaclk
Jn the Chicago & Northwestern stocks and 3%
in Lackawanna were accompanied by rumors
of a coming distribution of scrip. Sugar and
People's Gas gained nearly a point, at one
time. This about exhausts the Â¦ list of ad
vances worthy of mention. The rain and snow
in the winter wheat belt and the promised
benefit to the crop were used by traders as ar
pumenta for an advance in railroad stocks.
Money was easier and the large subscription
reported in New Tork for the German Impe
rial loan argued an abundance of local re
sources, although the disposition to turn to
foreign eecuritles while the local" Btock mar
ket was bo neglected was taken to indicate a
tendency not altogether favorable. The. lively
speculation in Kaffirs in the London market
Â¦while stocks continued to be Bold in New York
for London account, showed the same tendency
for speculation to be diverted to foreign mar
kets. The character of a good part of the
day's dealings was shown by the expressed ex
pectation that the Supreme Court would clear
tip the Northern Securities question by a de
cision next Monday, which - is the day set to
hear. arguments whether the proposed suit shall
be entertained.' .
The railroad bond market broadened . out to
day, bringing forward many dormant mort
gages into activity. The dealings in some of
these â notably in the Rock Island 4s and the
Central of Georgia, income Â«bonds and Consoli
dated 5s â were very heavy. There were ad
vances ranging from 1 to 2% in the Rock Isl
and 6s and 4s, the Oregon Short Line 6s, St.
IÂ»uis and San Francisco 6s and New Jersey
Central 5s. Central of Georgia Ists, 2ds and 3s.
Incomes, the Ohicapo and Pacific division 6s
end the St. Paul and Texas and Pacific Ists.
Total sales, par value. $4,â¬20,OO0.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

Redeemer. The affair was of
double interest jowing to the prominence
and popularity of the parties. Father Mc-
Quade performed the ceremony. The
wedding was a quiet one, only relatives
being- present. Hiss Angela Vallejo, the
bride's sister, was bridesmaid and Ed
McGettigan acted as best man.
After the wedding a reception was held
at the home of the couple at 4044 Eight
eenth nireet-
The bride is a tall, slender brunette of
charming personality. She is descended
from one of the old aristocratic families
of the State, being a daughter of Dr.
Platon Vallejo and granddaughter of Gen
eral' Vallejo. The groom is the son of
Edward McGettigan, formerly of Vallejo,
and a prominent politician. Dr. McGetti
gan graduated from St. Mary's College
and from the medical department of the
University of California with honors.
During the war with Spain Dr. McGetti
gan was lieutenant and assistant surgeon
in the Eighth Regiment, California Vol
unteers. Upon being mustered out he
opened an office in San Francisco and
soon established a large practice. Recog
nizing Dr. McGettigahs ability, the meai
cal department ot the State university
made him a demonstrator of anatomy.
He Is also one of the visiting physicians
of St. Mary's Hospital.
MISS FRANCISCA C. VALLEJO
and Dr. Charles D. McGettigan
were married yesterday after
noon at the Church of the Holy
"I'll tell you the truth of the matter"
said Braemer. "The old man and I have
been fighting for about six months and I
concluded to quit. Some errors had bÂ°en
discovered in the books and it was mu
tually agreed to have an expert go over
them. In order to indemnify the company
Attorneys Cleveland and O'Hara were ap
pointed trustees of my estate and I turned
over to them the $72,000 in stocks. If any
shortage is found I will be to blame. My
salary was $30 a week and has been for
the past ten years. I owned 515,000 worth
cf stock in the company. In conclusion I
Â¦wish to state that if there is any short
age I know nothing of it."
No reports of similar character ever
created such a sensation in this city, as
Braemer always has been regarded as a
man of the highest business and social
standing. He owns one of the finest resi
dences in the city and it is furnished with
all that art could supplv. In all of the
sensational reports that have been pub
lished no reference is made to him as a
fast man or of bad habits, such as arc
usually coupled with such sensations.
The attorneys and other interested per
sons will give no assurance that the report
cf the experts on the examination of the
books will be made public when com
pleted, as they state that every possible
difference has already been adjusted satis
factorily by the property that Braemer
has turned over in trust. All the inter
ested parties stale that they expected,,
after the meeting last Sunday, at which
Braemer resigned, that all differences
would be settled without the matter ever
becoming- public.
Some Errors in the Books.
Braemer is 45 years old and has been
with the Scroths twenty-seven years,
most of the time receiving J25 per week as
bookkeeper and in recent years twice that
much as secretary and treasurer. The
firm did a -business of about $1,000,000 a
year, which was collected by Braemer.
When John Scroth died, over a year
ago, Lieutenant Governor Carl Nippert
became the attorney of his heirs, who in
stituted an investigation of the company,
which finally culminated in a meeting of
all interested parties last Sunday, at
which Braemer resigned and from which
the sensational reports of to-day ema
nated.
Lieutenant Governor Nippert, attorney
for the heirs of John Scroth, is engaged
with the Legislature at Columbus, while
Harlan Cleveland, attorney for Braemer,
and John W. O"Hara, attorney for the
company and also for the trustees, are
engaged with the experts In examining
the books. The accountants insist that
they cannot complete their work for two
or three weeks, and counsel say that no
reliable statement can be made until that
time.
Not a Han of Bad Habits.
CINCINNATI, Jan. 22.â Sensational re
ports were published here to-day of an al
leged shortage in the books of Theodore
Braemer, who resigned last ; Sunday as
secretary and treasurer of the J. & F.
Scroth Packing Company of this city. The
jstory as first published alleged a shortage
of from 51G0.000 to $400,000, extending over
a period of twenty years, and declared
that Braemer had turned over all of his
property and chattels in trust pending an
examination of the books by experts.
Braemer denied that there was any defal
cation, but admitted that he had turned
over $72,000 in personal property to Harlan
Cleveland, his attorney, and Joseph W.

more or less magnetic, for he had resided
only a short time In â¢Fruitvale before he
Political and Social Leader.
Few of the neighbors ever crossed the
Bair threshold and when they did It -was)
only to chat in the parlor. The ' couple
frequently absented themselves from
home, going, away together for several
days at a time. The Bairs always had
money and never ran . bills. Never ex
travagant, they were i always tastefully
dressed; j and in â¢ general purchased freely
and never/so far as is known in the com
munity at Fruitvale, with. bogus money."
One debt Bair was known to haveâ a
mortgage on the pretty place on East
Sixteenth street, '. where he has lived for
the last two years. - He paid $90 on this
Indebtedness the day before his arrest.
'Bair was of regular Â¦ habits. He 'came
to this city daily and a short 1 time ago
showed a friend his "business" card, con
taining his name and giving his occupa
tion as assistant auditor of the board or
underwriters. ' Â¦ " , ' ".'"-Â¦ Â¦'" '"'.
The Bairs went to Fruitvale after sell
ing out a restaurant, conducted by them
at Tenth and Howard* streets, in San
Francisco. They- rented . a modest' cottage
on Bassett, street, residing there about a
year. Then, through H. A. Pleltner, a
Fruitvale real estate agent,' they built the
house on East Sixteenth street, which ha3
been a counterfeiting den as well as the
pretty home. of the couple..:
Last Monday night -Hazen and Moffltt
lay in the wet grass in the yard adjoining
the Bair cottage in Fruitvale watching
Bair at work In the lighted attic until 1
a m Almost up to midnight Miss Snicke
tanz played the piano in the parlor and
sang several songs. . - *,
: Bair had cards . printed representing
himself to be the auditor of the Pacific
Coast Underwriters', Union. This was
done In. order to divert suspicion, lest the
source of his income might be suspected.
The Bairs- slept in the Alameda County
Jail last night.
Fruitvale society is stirred to its depths
at the revelation of the - dual existence
of Mr. and Mrs. Bair. They were the re
cipients of cordial greetings and neighbor
ly, confidences by all who knew them.
They joined the local lodges, attended the
neighborhood socials and went out a great
deal. 'But it now occurs to their admirers
that the Bairs never, entertained. Their

became a prominent figure, not only in
the social life, but in a political way. In
fact, he had been mentioned as a possible
candidate for Supervisor in the Alameda
district, now represented by Supervisor
J. R. Talcott.
It was known among his friends that
Bair "played the races." That had been
a hobby of his before he went to Fruit
vale, and those who knew him well say ,he
sold out his restaurant in this city to
raise money to follow the horses. That
Bair only utilized the racetrack as a
means of disposing of his counterfeit coin
is now believed to be the fact. Quite re
cently he had become affiliated with the
Woodmen, the Red Men and other frater
nal organizations, and there was not a
question concerning his standing. His
friends say he will nave no trouble in se

As early as last November Secret Ser
vice Agents Moffltt and' Foster went to
work - to trace the , bad dollars , to their
source, and. after sufficient evidence had
been gathered to show that Bair. was t.ie
only person doing | this at the racetrack
Moffltt and Foster, J and later on Foster,
and Police Detective Archie Hamill, were
put on the "trail of Mrs. Bair, , -while Mof
fltt and Hazen shadowed Bair at the race
track and at his home.'. Mrs. . Bair was
accompanied by her sister, Miss Nellie
Shlcketanz, in her trips to this city. Mrs.
Bair- visited restaurants, .drugstores, dry
goods ' stores â¢ and street flower peddlers
and passed the / bad dollars, .^receiving
change in good. money. 'As soon" as she
left one - place the shadowers ? went ' In'
and recovered the bad dollars, which they,
afterward marked as evidence/- The coun-'
terfelts were so good that It was with dif
ficulty that the sleuths could convince the
victims that the- money was' bad. One
day she bought a bunch of violets from
Â¦rj- - Â¦rrX.YSSES G. BAIR and his wife.
I I' Kate, were transferred by Secret
â¢ 11 . fl Service Agent Hazen to the cus-
tody' of United States Marshal
Shine yesterday afternoon after
Agent Hazen had sworn to- three com
plaints I against the prisoners. . The first
complaint . charges Bair with having un
lawfully in his possession on January 21
at Emeryville eleven j counterfeit dollars,
and with having passed six of them on
John Doe, true name unknown. Â¦ The sec
ond complaint charges Bair with having
in his possession tools for the manufac
ture of counterfeit dollars. ; The charge
against Kate Bair is that of having
passed counterfeit dollars' uppn several
personsâ restaurant-keepers and street
flower peddlers. The prisoners were taken
before United States. Court Commissioner
Heacock, and on motion of Assistant
United States District Attorney Duncan
K McKinlav ball was fixed for Bair in
the sum of $3000 and for Mrs.. Bair in the
sum of $1000. The prisoners were repre
sented by Eugene F. Bert. Next Monday
at 10 a. m. was fixed as the time for the
preliminary, examination. -
Was Paying for a Cottage.
It is more than likely that Bair will
waive examination and go before the
United States District . Court and plead
Kuiltv after the indictment shall have
been" found by the Federal Grand Jury.
Bair said yesterday that he did not'know
what he would do until he had seen his
attorney, but he had no hesitation in de
claring that he was guilty. All that he
asked was that he might not be dealt
with too harshly. He had disposed of the
counterfeit money, he said, at tHe race
track, and nobody had been injured there
by except the bookmakers or their pa
trons, to whom they had passed out the
bad dollars. He added that his winnings
at the racetrack averaged $600 per month,
and his surplus earnings went to pay a.
building and loan society for the pretty
cottage he lived in over at Fruitvale. on
Sixteenth street, the total cost of which
was $4500. He intended after the cottage
had been paid for to invest in a Bmall
chicken ranch in the country and earn an
honest living, he said. The plaster molds
with' which he finished the counterfeit
pieces he >dr6pped into the bay while
crossing over on the ferry. It was his
practice to make a certain number of dol
lars and then destroy the' molds, making
new ones whenever they were needed. .
' Skillful Counterfeiting.
Agents Hazen, Harry Moffltt and Thom
as B Foster say that the counterfeit dol
lars made by Bair are the best they ever
saw The ring is perfect and the molding
as sharply done as though the metal were
struck from a steel die. The great defect
is lightness, they being 25 per cent under
weight \* Â¦ Â¦ ' ' 'Â¦ -*
At the racetrack Bair made five bets
on each- j-ace, each bet of $2 or $4. in the
first cas4 using a good dollar and a bad
one, and/ in the second two good, and two
bad dollars. He placed the good dollars
over the bad ones, so that the deficiency
In weight might not be detected, and al
ways waited tuntll Â»: there was a crowd at
â¢the pool boxes. After he had; placed a
bet with" one bookmaker he squirmed
through ihe crowd and placed the other
bets with other bookmakers. It was this
habit of betting at the . different stands
and always in silver that first aroused
the suspicions of the secret service men;
and his hand containing the money was
seized by Agent Hazen just as Bair was
passing it up to the bookmaker.

A prominent member of the West In- '
dian sugar committee points out that in
spite of the vigorous action by the Amer
ican Treasury". Department regarding
Russian sugar, 'that department of the
American Government had not . so far
taken cognizance of the German and Aus
trian. "Kartels," which have proved an
important factor in the Brussels confer
ence, and which both the French and
British delegates to the conference have
declared to be more vital than the boun
ties. . '; Â¦ -â¢Â¦- V Â¦ - ;,..:: . - ; - , - . 7.
No "Kartels" exist in France, and un
less some modification Â¦ of the existing
conditions be arrived at France's sugar in
dustry is likely to suffer equally with
Great Britain's, in spite of the French
sugar bounty, which i France has ex
pressed her willingness to withdraw in the
event of the suppression of the Austrian
and German "Kartels" and bounties.
The best informed opinion here is that
on the failure of the Brussels conference,
both Great Britain and France will bring
. forward in their respective legislatures
measures providing for countervailing du
ties upon German and Austrian sugar,
such duties to cover not only the benefits
derived from bounties, but also those pro
fits accruing from the "Kartel" system
of exportation.
Advices received from Brussels by sugar
magnates here are to the effect that both
Great Britain and France have demanded
that Germany and Austria not only,with
draw their bounties, but suppress the
"Kartels," which are represented as be
ing merely unofficial forms. for providing
subsidy for sugar producers. Germany
and Austria have so far maintained their
attitude, which expresses intoleratloh at
what they describe as interference i in
purely internal affairs, and while they are
willing to amend their sugar bounties
they utterly decline to discuss the "Kar
tels." ' , 'Â¦:..-
The "Kartels" (organizations of sugar
refiners) in the latter countries formed
the rock upon which delegates to the con
ference wiir split. Yaves Guidet, ' former
editor of Le Siecle and one of the best
known publicists in France, who repre
sents the various French governmental
and industrial interests," recently had an
important secret . conference -.with Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach, Chancellor ' of the
British Exchequer, .with the result that
France and Great Britain are practically
committed to a commercial alliance in an
endeavor to suppress sugar, bounties.' Â¦
" LONDON, Jan. 22.â It is ..learned to
night that the international sugar confer
ence at Brussels is practically . certain to
end in a disagreement between the powers
concerned therein, with the r result that
Fpance and Great Britain will take active
steps against the. Austrian and German
bounty, systems. .-.'".. 'Â¦':..

It has been decided that Christian Science is
not the practice of medicine, and there Is no
law in this State that is being violated by
Christian Science methods.
The. health officer's communication to the
District Attorney carried with it a number of
newspaper clippings bearing upon prosecutions
of persons In other States. Error was made
to say- they referred to Christian Scientists.
One was a '"mental healer" and the other an
"astrologer," who had been charged with using
the malls for alleged fraudulent purposes.
Mrs. Schafer did her full duty in the matter
by notifying the health officer. He did not do
his duty, because he placarded the house with
out examining the case.
OAKLAND, Jan. 22.â Frank ,W. Gale,

BEAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS-
In making the new move Dr. Baker said:
"We believe that the religious education
of our children should be made as much
of as the secular. It is almost impossible
to make it so without securing a trained
educator. Volunteer teachers are willing,
but that does not necessarily make them
competent. For someitime we have felt
that our Sunday school should be built
up, that is, made a more important factor
in church life than it is, and to that end
wo have secured Bingham.' s- services."
Bingham will, for the present, be with
the work on Saturdays and Sundays. His
home is in San Jose.
â¢ OAKLAND, Jan. 22.â Earl S. Bingham*
secretary or the California Sunday School
Association, has been chosen as supervis
ing superintendent of the First Presby
terian Church Sunday School, pending the
selection of a permanent salaried head of
that department of church, activity. The
move is in line with that recently taken
by the First Congregational Church,
which secured a salaried superintendent
of Sunday school work in the person of
State Superintendent Halliday of Maine.*
The committee in charge of the -First
Pr.esbyterian Church school is composed
of the pastor, the Rev, Ernest E. Baker,
D. Edward Collins, T. C. Bee and W. F.
Curtis.
Salaried Superintendent Is to
.Be Installed.
The Eev. E..E. Baker Tells Wly a
NEEDS TRAINED MAN AT
HEAD OF STTNDAY-SCHOOI,
Chancellor von Bulow, ' rising, -said \ he
wished it to be understood that his pre
vious reference to perfect recjprocity and
mutual appreciation referred not only to
the United States, but equally to the other
countries of the world.-
â¢ The Chancellor's statement was greeted
with prolonged cheers from all parts of
the house. Dr. Oertel, Conservative, said
the Right attached as much Importance
to the maintenance of good relations with
the United States as the Left, but these
relations would not be maintained by
means of economic- concessions. The
closer these relations the more attention
should be paid to the preservation of re
ciprocity.
I express my thanks to Dr. Barth for the
"words and manner in which he has spoken of
our relations with the United States. I still
must , ask him not to overestimate the diffi
culties from the way in which we formulate
our tariff policy. I can only repeat what I
said three years ago In the Reichstag, and I
believe the views I then set forth in detail will
to-day meet with the concurrence of the House
â namely, that we are filled with an earnest
desire to maintain, on the basis of perfect reci
procity and mutual appreciation, the tradi
tional cood relations which have always ex
isted between ourselves and the United States.
The visit of Prince Henry to America is an
expression of these srood relations, and I am
convinced his reception will be in accord with
the friendly feeling the two great nations have
for one another. Â¦ .'
I want to touch upon the political relations
Â¦between Germany and the United States,
which are traditionally friendly in character.
One hindrance to the promotion of this friend
ship, is the protectionism now prevailing in
Germany. It is pleasant, on the other hand,
to see that the predicted visit of a German
Prince i to the United States has disclosed the
existence of a large fund of good will and
cordiality among the American people for Ger
many. We recognize in the Union not merely
a great and economically effective community,
but . we know that the achievements of the
United States in other fields, such a3 civiliza
tion and culture, are very Important. The
cultivation of the friendship, of the two coun
tries is a thing to be grateful for. (Applause.)
Replying to Dr. Barth Count von Bulow
said:
.^BERLIN, Jan. 22.â During the debate on
iiha estimates of the Chancellor's Depart
ment in the - Reichstag to-day the Im
perial Chancellpr, Count von Bulow, re
ferred to the pleasant relations between
Germany and the United States and to
the approaching visit of Prince Henry of
Prussia. The Chancellor found his op
portunity in the remarks of Dr. Barth,
leader of the Frelsinnlge party, who, in
discussing the budget, said:
tions With American
.. - Republic.

Praise for the United

A general uproar followed, arid it waa
only when the Vicar General prepared to
carry out his threat to clear. the hall that

.'"Farce!" and "Conspiracy!" accompanied
Bishop Gore's declaration and the ad

The Vicar General ruled out most of
the protests, whereupon Kensit in vigor
ous terms defied the Vicar General to
stifle him, declaring he would continue to
protest until ejected by force. /'
Bishop Gore'g editorship of Lux Mundi
and the" fact that he is the founder of a
monastic celibate society figured largely
among- the arguments of the protestors.
Numerous objectors to the confirmation,
among whom was John Kensit, the noto
rious anti-ritualist crusader, protested so
vehemently that what was intended to be
a semi-religious ceremony assumed the
character of a disorderly political gath

BRIEF CITY NEWS.
At the suggestion of the Secretary of State,
by request of the British 'Government,- you are
directed to report whether there has been any
signs on your coast of a British â¢warship In
distress, or any wreckage therefrom. | This In
quiry la made because of fear that an acci
dent may have befallen the British Â¦ warship
Condor, which left Esquimau for Honolulu on
December 2, and has not been heard from.
A report of the wreckage found by the
revenue cutter Grant off the Vancouver
coast, consisting of oars, pieces of boats
and a portion of a cabin and also the
finding of a clinker built ship's boat by
Indians at the entrance of Barclay Sound,
was sent to the department. The boat
answers the description of, those carried
by the Condor, and It is the opinion of
shipping men that it belonged to the miss
ing warship.
The wreckage reported by the Grant Is
fresh and was not there several months
ago, when ' the Grant made a cruise
around that island. Captain Tozier say3
that, judging from the amount of wreck
age strewn on the . beach, the recent
storms played havoc with many vessels
of which no report has been made. The
Grant will remain here for a day or two.
In anticipation of orders to make an ex
tended cruise to search for the missing
warship.
PORT TOWNSEND. Wash.. Jan. 22.â
The British Admiralty has about given
up hope for the safety of the warship
Condor, according to a dispatch received
here to-day by Collector of Customs

The public raising up of the chiefs of the
various local councils , of the Degree of
Pocahbntas, Improved Order of Red Men,
in Union Square Hall last night was wit
nessed, by many members of the order and
visitors i designated as "palefaces." The
ceremony of raising up of chiefs.' as the
installation of officers is called in that
organization, was impressively conducted
by. Mina Rew, great Pocahontas; Hattle
James, great prophetess; Minnie Â¦; Belts,
great Wenonah; J. G. Smith, Powhattan;

George Wheeler as master of ceremonies
and Walter Dpxey as "senior past chief.
The, chiefs were raised up in the main
body , of the hall and. the stage, was ar
-ranged as an Indian village. The follow
ing were the chiefs raised. up:
Oberdeener lives on Haight street, near
Fillmore, and was on his way home. He
was walking, along the west side of Web
ster street, between Oak and Page, where
there are no houses, when he passed three
men. He had his umbrella up and did not
see them till he. was close upon them.
Just as he was passing | them one ,said:
"Say, young fellow, we want to speak to
you." He stopped and was told to throw,
up his hands and make no noise. The tall
est of the three men had something .like
a revolver in his hand and -kept it in view
of Oberdeener, while another of the foot
pads went through his pockets. =
After securing Oberdeener's money they
told him to "get," and not make any out
cry or he would repent it.. -As soon as he
got away he started to run and did not
stop until he reached the barber shop on
Haight street, near Fillmore.
Oberdeener notified -the police Tuesday,
and from the description he gave of the
three men it is supposed they, might have
been those who killed Policeman Robin-
Bon.
Three footpads held up Charles Ober
deener, salesman for W. Oberdeener, sta
tionery and f paper merchant, 18 .â¢ First
s'trect, on Webster, -street/ between Oak
and Page, shortly after 7 o'clock Monday
night and robbed him of $5. all the money
he had in his possession.
The . appeal of Mrs. Abbie Rose Wood - in
the suit brought by her to recover a por
tion of her late husband's estate, and also
the appeal from Judge /froutt's refusal: to
grant her a family* allowance, were ar
gnued yesterday in. the Supreme Court./ln
the original action she failed ,' to : secure
judgment; on' the ground' that she waa a
divorced .woman and could not legally
marrywithin a year after, the decree had
been granted,, the court holding that her
marriage : to . Joseph | M. -Wood | at Reno,
Nev., wasan evasion of the laws of Cal
if ornia ana . the.retore invalid. ; -â¢ .. .
The Chief Justice' and Justices McFar
land and Garoutte appeared to take the
view, yesterday that as the California law
stands , the. prohibition against divorced
parties marrying within one year after
uivorce coulo>only. apply to the case of
a marriage. in California; in. other words,
that the divorced party may: go beyond
the State and marry where he or she
pleases. Â¦Â¦: r Â¦ ; \ .
'Attorney Timothy J. Lyons, who argued
in favor of the validity of^the Reno mar
riage, claimed that the laws of the State
as .to marriages' only refer ' to unions con
tracted In the State, and that no State
has.any. right to make a law as to the
effect of any act done in another State;
also, that the: right of marriage is one of
peculiar- sanction in that marriage is the
foundation â¢ of - human society, and that
the right of marriage is therefore a nat
ural one,, which may be exercised and en
tered into wherever the parties ."may
choose. Lyons also contended that it is
unreasonable to ask a court ' to undo an
act which parties have done under the
highest obligation to society.
Former Judge Oliver: P. Evans, counsel
for. the .heirs disputing, the marriage, ar
gued that a divorce decree in this State
did. not go intoJeffect until, one year alter
the 'judgment of . divorce was rendered.
He further argued- that., the.- divorced
parties remained in law married during
that one year of â¢ suspension. â¢Â¦
It was this contention on the part of
Evans that called forth the questioning
remarks of the -Chief Justice and of Jus
tices-Garoutte and McFarland. '.
Evans,: was apparently angered at the
questions put .to film- at intervals by At
torney, ~W. S.'Wo'bd; who appeared as as
sociate counsel with Lyons. 'Evans also
complained of ' the criticisms of him con
tained, in the reply ' brief of "Wood and
Lyons and took especial objection to that
part of i. the criticism which, he said, was
an attempt, to teach him how to write a
brief. Turning to opposing counsel Evans
said bitterly, "I. take it whence', it comes,
and so let- it rest- on that."

ment.- . â¢ . -.-. > -. . .. Â¦ "â¢*Â¦ .
