. .solved the temporary injunc
:. tion issued yesterday in the
case of Peter Power against the North

â¢Elliott of the District Court of Hennepin
County. .. - â¢ â¢
-:" The injunction which was dissolved by!
the order of â¢ Judge Lochren restrained
.the Northern Pacific Â¦ from issuing any
evidences' of indebtedness to retire the
preferred .stock of the company, or to re
tire the preferred stock in any other man

earnings of the; road. It also restrained
the. Northern Pacific and its officers from
entering into 'any agreement or ' doing
any,;act by which the road would be
consolidated or ' merged, through the me

tionary with the court, I decline to per
mit the staying of the proceeding or the
force of the order by a supersedeas bond
on appeal." â¢>â¢*Â¦;
No Evidence of a Merger.
Judge Lochren held that the Northern
Pacific was acting within the authority of
its charter, of the contract entered into
between it and its stockholders, as Incor
porated In the certificate of preferred
stock and of the agreement entered Into
on November 13 in attempting to retire the
$75,000,000 of preferred stock In the manner
alleged by Power.'
He held that railroad corporations could
not do indirectly what the law "prevented
them doing directly and that any method
by which consolidation of two or more
competing parallel Iine3 would be brought
about would be illegal and a writ of In
junction would He to restrain the consum
mation of the plan; but that there was
nothing in the case as presented to htm
that would indicate that the stockholders
of the Northern Pacific Railway Company
were attempting such a consolidation or
merger. HE9
The case was transferred late last night
by the Northern Pacific from the State
to the FederalCourt and an order to show
cause, returnable this morning, why the
temporary injunction granted by Judge
Elliott should not be dissolved, was ob
tained from Judge Lochren and served
late last night upon Powers* attorney.
The answer of the defendant was filed, in
the District Court and the order removing
the same to the Federal Court was served
from Judge Brooks of the Hennepin Dis
trict Court.* Â¦;.'-'Â¦ â¢
Hill Not Caught Napping.
The Northern Pacific's answer was .a
lengthy document of thiriy-two type
written pages and ostensibly was pre
pared on a few hours' notice. All of tha
legal staff of the railway was on hand at
the calling of the case ln Judge Lochren's
court this morning. They ' were C. W.
Bunn, Frank Kellogg aad Former Judga
Young of St.- Paul. Bunn admitted in hla
argument that he and his colleagues wero
well prepared to, argue the case and had
hot been caught by surprise.
â¢ Representing, Power were George A.
Lamb of Lamb & Guernsey, New York;
Mr.' Moore of Buckley, Gray & Moore,
Chicago, and Attorneys Lancaster, Belden
and Boutell of 'Minneapolis.
Power's - attorneys to-night authorized
the statement that the fight had just com
menced and that they would appeal to the
United States Supreme Court.
Counsel Claim Big Victory. \
Judge. Lochren, in his decision, makes
a ruling which the attorneys of J. J. Hill
maintain settles the question of the le
gality of the proposed merger. Said the
court; * x '
-"It the Northern Pacific Railroad never
thought of consolidation, but to pay oft
the preferred stockholders and issue
common stock, it had authority to >do.
that, and that of Itself would certainly
have no tendency toward consolidation.
"It is claimed that it would place cer
tain persons who are alleged to be ma
nipulating these stocks with a view to
consolidation or merger in a position in
which they would be enabled to carry
out their schemes better than if there was
not a retiring of the preferred stock. That
is asserted. I do not see that it very
clearly, appears from any of the facts
that are set forth.
"The mere scheme of retiring of tha
preferred stock could be carried out just
as* fully if .\ for instance, the" Northern
Securities Company had never been
thought of. The same persons who own
the common stock now own it without any
reference to the Northern Securities
Company. .
"It Is not very clear t to me why they '
could not manage these three companies
with as much reference to doinfc away
with competition without any such com
pany bting formed as with it. If tha same
persons own all or substantially all 6t the
stock "of both companies, I do not. see tha
necessity, of forming that company sim
ply for the purpose of carrying that pur
pose, out.- They might do it just as well
without it. V
"But I do not ' see that the retiring of
the preferred stock has anything to do of
itself, naturally, with the formation ot
the Northern Securities Company; If that
is an Illegal conception. Of Itself the re
tirement of the . stock Is a lawful pur
pose, something that might properly be
done."

ed Germany will be compelled to use

ln view of President Castro*s * known

Washington assert that the few hundred
German marines who will be landed will
be unable to ho'd La Guayra, even un
der the guns of their men of warJ Ad
ministration officials say that German
prestige will necessitate a full settlement
tf the claims presented by the Berlin
Government and this may lead to the
landing of a large force at La Guayra
or some other port. Thus will the United
States, officials apprehend, be drawn into
ti^Â£ Venezuelan, complications., for the
Â¦ j President will probably not favor the
' landing of a strong German army on
American territory. Germany does not
desire to become embroiled with this
-country and has displayed marked con
sideration in connection with her diffi
culty with Venezuela.
- That there may be absolutely no doubt
as to the position of the United States
and Germany In Venezuelan develop-
I merits, Secretary Hay and Herr von Hol-
: v leben, the German Ambassador, have ex
" changed formal memorandums embodying
their viewE as to the attitudes of their
i respective Governments. While It is im
5 possible to obtain the text of these memo
," randums, I understand they declare:
: | Embassador von Hollebenâ Germany
Ef-B** no intention of permanently occupy
Â¦ ( ing Venezuelan territory, the taking j of
which will injuriously affect the United
States in Venezuela. It is her desire to
collect usi claims ueld by her subject?,
|rhlch .Venezuela has failed to pay, and to
this end she contemplates employing **o- I
ercive mÂ°a*uroj. These measures will not
. o'o farther than the seizure of custom
houses and the collection of duties until
â the sums required to satisfy the- claims
are paid or Venezuela enters into an ar
' rangem-ant under which payment will be
| rr.arj*.
Secretary Hayâ Provided there tie no
.attempt at permanent acquisition of
American territory, the United States can
offer no objection to the action of Ger
: many in Venezuela. The United States
understands that as 6oon as the claims
. " ire satisfied either by payment or an ar
m rangenent for their settlement, Germany
*,will withdraw Â«J1 her forces from Vene

*i President Roosevelt and Secretary Hay
'would naturally prefer that all need for

Trustees Order Owners of Abandoned
Road to Show Cause Why Rights
Are Not Lost- ;
BERKELEY. Dec 3Lâ The Town Trus
tees have ordered the owners of the street
railroad franchise between East and West
Berkeley to appear before them next
Monday evening to show cause why the
f ranchfse should not be forfeited. Trus
tee Dowd brought up the matter last
night. He called attention to the fact that
the roadbed had been torn up for several
months and that there were no indica
tions of the road being rebuilt. Trustee
Staats believed that the abandonment of
the road was a forfeiture, but it was de
cided to give the present owners, who
presumably represent the Oakland Transit
Company, a nnal opportunity to make use
of the property.
The franchise was formerly held by the
Clarempnt, University and Ferries street
rallroaa, a horse car line, but it was sold
recently and it was thought that an elec
tric line would be put in. The oWett in
calling the owners before the boa.rd is to
discover whether this will be done.

ing the lives of the prisoners to shedding

REDDING, Dec 3Lâ Redding was
greatly shocked this morning when the
news spread that George 'A. Littlefleld,
the local manager for the Terry Lumber
Company, had committed suicide in his
home by firing a bullet from a revolver
through his heart.
Littlefleld had been telephoning on busi
ness matters to the Terry Mills at Bella
Vista. He then walked by ln> wife into
the bedroom adjoining her room, drew his
pistol ai| *.?hot himself. The action was
unexpectÂ«^.va?d was done in a fit of tem
per.
Littlefield held a responsible and lucra
tive position, had a charming wife and
two brig-ht children. Early this morning
he telephoned ; his wife to- come down as
he was not feeling well. On the way down
town she burst out crying and told, a
friend: she could bear. It no longer. Her
husband returned home soon after talk
ing with her and met her and her mother
Mrs. Grace. Kuhn of Red Bluff. He then
used the telephone and ended his life with
the revolver; - He was a Native Son and a
Workman. '.Th^body will be taken for

The police believe that- Bitzer. is. insane.
The note which they found in his store
after the affair was almost an Incoherent
Jumble of words. After telling, of. the
shooting of Miss Columbe, Bitzer wrote
that he had determined to go to his home
and end the lives of his wife and', children
and his own. He asked that at his funeral
the hymn, "Nearer, My God, to Thee " be
sung. . '-' /..- ,'..,..'.
Substantially the same story, was told
by Bitzer after his arrest.
' The 16-year-old daughter, Annie, was
shot through the left hand and in the
ear. The 12-year-old daughter, Carrie, was
shot through" the neck. Mrs. Bitzer was
hit in the face, the bullet passing through
the nose.
The sound - of shots brought , neighbors
into the house and Bitzer was arrested.. .
TURNERS " FALLS, . Mass.,* Dec. 31.â
Louis BItzer, a jeweler of this place, to
day shot five persons, two of whom, his
clerk, Miss Ida Columbe, and Bitzer's five
year-old son, are dead. His other victims
were his wife/ Christina, and his . two
daughters, Annie, about 16 years old* and
Carrie, 12 years old. It is thought they
will not die. There is evidence that it
was Bitzer's intention to take his own
lifo also, but his prompt arrest prevented
him from carrying out this purpose. He
is about 35 years of age. . â¢ '
From a note left in his store by Bitzer
it appears that while he' was cleaning a
revolver the weapon was discharged acci
dentally and the bullet hit Miss Columbe
in the head, killing her instantly. Over
come by the situation. Bitzer apparently
rushed to his home,- hatless and wild with
excitement and began the work of exter
minating his family. â¢. \ '

EXCITE RICHMOND
In the official circular W. S. Palmer is
appointed superintendent at Oakland and
F. E. Prior to succeed him.. The paper is
Changes in the Southern Pacific Com
pany have beeji coming fast and thick
lately. When J. L. Frazler was appointed
superintendent at Oakland recently, it was
thought that at last the railroad corpora
tion had settled down to Its normal state.
Frazier. however, threw up his position to
go East with the Toledo, St. Louis and
Western Railroad Monday and The. Call,
In making the announcement of his resig
nation, predicted that Palmer would suc
ceed him. ' , .
AS announced in The Call yester
day, J. L. Frazier has tendered
his resignation as superintendent
of the Southern Pacific Company
at OakHnd. The resignation has
been accepted and W- S. Palmer, who is
at present superintendent of the Sacra
mento division, has been named to suc
ceed him. F. E. Prior, assistant superin
tendent at Los Angeles, will take Pal
mer's post at Sacramento.
W. S. Palmer was for many years Man
ager Agler's assistant. He has in his
short, period as superintendent at Sacra
mento "made hosts of friends, who will
greatly regret his removal to Oakland.
Palmer has the reputation of being a hard
worker. He can be found at his desk
from early morning until ' the last clerk
has left the office at night. His character
istics are similar to those of Kruttschnitt,
who believes that wheK a man Is working
there is not a moment to be spent for rest
or recreation and to this quality mainly
his promotion ha3 been due.
the Santa Fe at Gaiveston. He next en
tered the passenger department of the
Northern Pacific and remained there from
1S85 to 1887. He then- accepted a position
with the California Southern Railway in
the auditor's office: In 1887 he became an
employe of the Southern Pacific Company
in -the^ superintendent's jofflce at Los An
geles. In 1895 he was promoted to the po
sition of assistant division superintendent
at Los Angeles. He is looked upon as a
very bright railroad man and has done
much to foster the big travel in. Southern
California.
P. E. Prior, who goes to Sacramento as
superintendent of the' division, is an old
railroad man, although he is only 42 years
of age. Prior entered the railroad world
in 1S83. He first secured a position with
his resignation.
i The company's new paid-for business in
1901, excluding risks rejected, etc., is
$260 000,000." The total paid-for Insurance
In force is $1,360,000,000, a gain of $160,0C0,uu l )
over the previous year.
It is estimated in banking circles that
the dividend and interest payments on
Government, State, municipal, railroad
and other corporation securities payable
on January 1 will be $400,000,OCO. The new
business offered to the New York Ufa
during 1901 is nearly equal to these com
bined payments.
NEW TORK, Dec. 31.â The closing ( day
of the year indicates great prosperity In
every business direction. The large mer
cantile houses, the various banking in
stitutions and the trades generally are
quite enthusiastic with the records made.
The fire insurance business has not re
sulted In great profits for stockholders
owing to the poor rates obtained, but the
regular or old-line life insurance compa
nies, on the other hand, will make a
splendid showing for their policy-holders.
The leader in business obtained and in
force will undoubtedly be the New York
Life, as President McCall has issued &
statement that the new applications to
his company In 19tfl will exceed $380,000,000,
or more than $1,000,000 for every day in
the year. This is an unprecedented rec
ord.

SPLENDID YEAH'S SHOWING
W. S. Palmer Is a civil engineer and
knows construction work thoroughly, as
well as the operation of a railroad. These
are the facts which struck Assistant Pres
ident Kruttschnitfs heart. Kruttschnitt
is a fine railroad engineer and admires
any one who has studied and become ex
pert In engineering. It is said- that he ad
vised the promotion of Palmer the mo
ment he knew that Frazler had tendered

It Is found that but two months on record,
AuRTjrt and September. 1807, found this metal
selling as low. At that time the bottom was
touched at 23% pence, or about 2 cents an
ounce lower than the low record of 1901.
The year 1901 brought almost a nnlform de
cline in silver throughout the entire . period,
culminating In sales during December at 24.91
pence In London and B4 cents at Xew York.
In the year of big things It wgs natural that
new high records should be recorded in deposits
and loans. Financing of big syndicate opera
tions and unparalleled stock market dealing's
combined to raise the total of loans and dis
counts to S914.C23.000 on February IS against
$825,830,000 on September 15. 1900. ' the top
point of that year. On the same date deposits
attained their zenith at $1,011,329,000 com
pared with $914,810,300 on March 4, 1809, the
record prior to 1901. At the time of more
than a billion deposits the banks only held in
actual cash $265,684,700, or .512.S52.450 above
the 25 per cent legally required. On March 2
there was a new deposit record of,$1,012,514,
400. but loans did net attain their maximum
until March 9, at $918.789.600. '
Tremendous Banking Business.
Expanding crops of sugar had the effect of
lowering prices while competition caused a
still larger fall In the finished product, to the
great benefit of consumers. Petroleum was
less fluctuating, the extremes of the year be
ing 0.9 and 7.65 cents for refined in barrel
cargoes. Extensive fields In the South were
developed, which tended to hold prices down.
Export3 of the staple products reached a new
high record, notwithstanding the lower aver
age prices of oil and cotton, and the scarcity
of corn. The crop year opened with a new
record of wheat and flour exports, amounting
to 34,130,380 bushels In August, far surpassing
any previous month, while for . five months
ending November 30 the aggregate was 126 -
92S.1C2 bushels.
While 1900 was the best year ever experi
enced by domestic agricultural interests, the
opening year of the new century was in many
ways more profitable, and the two together
have put the farming population in much the
most satisfactory position In the nation's his
tory. Formerly the season of harvesting and
croi moving brought heavy borrowing of funds
at the East, but interior conditions have
changed to such an extent that Western banks
are lenders of Xew York and Chicago,- and
while there Is still a large movement of
money away from the East during the full
months, It Is of funds that were held here for
the account of Interior correspondents. There
ie a steady tendency to enlarge the acreage
sown in the leading crops, yet supplies do not
increase, owing to the better demand, both for
home consumption and export. Heat and
drought caused a serious curtailment of the
corn crop, which proved the most important
event of the year. While this influence natu
rally induced an advance in prices that practi
cally prohibited exports, and thus seriously af
fected foreign commerce, it was by no meanj
an unmixed evil, since the return to growers
was even larger than in a year of normal
production, while the enormous yield of wheat
was absorbed by stock-feeding and foreign con
sumers In place of corn. Hence, instead of a
low jrlce for wheat in proportion to the heavy
crop, there was maintained an even higher
average quotation than In the short crop year
precedinc. Meats naturally reflected the ex
pensive position of fodder and it was gratify
ing to notice that exports were not materially
reduced by the high level. ' Cotton passed a
season of wide variation, in the early months
attaining the highest price^of the decade, but
falling back sharply as the spinning situation
was rendered unfavorable by. exorbitant raw
material. Crop estimates were also far apart,
causing Irregularity and a tendency to await
more definite information. The outlook grew
much more cheerful from the producer's point
of view when the closing month brought a
higher price than 8 cents. Equally erratic
was the course of coffee, on account of heavy
Brazilian receipts and reports of extensive dis
asters. Option trading at the Coffee Exchange
rose far above the quiet conditions of recent
years. *
Domestic Agricultural Interests.
An entire year. of activity and aa era of
high prices characterized the leather market,
but there has been no boom, such as expe
rienced during 1S95 and which resulted in one
of the most dlstastrous r.lumps ever known in
leather history. The rise in values was steady
and by easy stages and entirely legitimate, in
asmuch as It was based on the laws of sup
ply and demand.
Further declines occurred in the price of this
staple during the opening months of 1001 and
the bottom was not reached until July 1, when
100 gTades, according to Coates & Brothers'
circular, was quoted at 17.06 cents. This
represented a less of 31 per cent from the high
point of 24. TO cents In December, 1393. AYith
the absorption of surplus stocks and general
revival in the industry, the turning point was
reached In September. Further strength and
activity was in evidence each succeeding
month.
AH records of output for hard and soft coal
were surpassed during 1901, despite the scarcity
of cars ihat retarded operations. A feature of
great advantage was the expanding export
movement, which reached more encouraging
proportions than in earlier years. In ten
-months the value of shipments was $19,0S7,303
against $17,820,864 the . year previous. Coke
ovens made a phenomenal record, establishing
a new high water mark of weekly output at
244,520 tonr late In November.
Readjustments of quotations were secured
during December after a year of unreasonably
inflated prices. Copper was stubbornly held at
17 cents most of the time, but when the reac
tion began there was a fail of 4 cents within a
few days. Tin was advanced to 2S : >4 cents in
June, but fell to 22 cents in December. Sim
ilarly with lead the nominal price of 4% cents
was cut to 4 cents. Tin plates closed the year
where they opened, but in the interim there
was an advance of $7 on account of the famine
that followed the strike. .
Aside from the slight fall during the period
affected by the strike, there appears almost a
steady rain in production, closing with the
maximum quantity on record. While- the out
put en December 1 was at the unparalleled rate
of 10.887.572 tons yearly, it is obvious that the
actual production for the year was much small
er, although quite sufficient to establish a ne.w
record, and judging by the amount of business
already placed for 1902, the current year's yield
may not unreasonably be expected to surpass
17,000,000 tons. The output of rails was be
yond all records yet and contracts fcr 1002 al
ready Indicate another high-water mark of
probably 3,000,000 tons.
Coal Output Surpasses All Records.
After the reaction of 1000 the level of prices
remained depressed for some months, but gen
erally responded to the Increasing demand as
excessive accumulations were absorbed. From
a condition of glut there arose almost a famine,
greatly exaggerated by the stubborn strike.
Borne idea of the changes in Eize of supplies
may be found in the comparison qr furnace
stocks of pigiron, as published In the Iron Age,
which amounted to 5-18.C63 tons on January 1.
These figures steadily declined throughout the
year until only 223,402 tons were held on De
cember 1. - . Â¦
Most marvelous of all the phenomenal evi
dences of advancement In business during the
year was the progress made in manufacturing.
It is Impossible to be too extravagant in delin
eating the movements of the industrial world.
Never In the history of this or any other na
tion has such development occurred within the
space of a twelvemonth. The expansion of pro
ductive capacity was enormous, the Improved
methods of work and organization were con
spicuous, wise economies were introduced, but
more than all other factors that made for per
manent prosperity was the conservative resist
ance to price Inflation.
NEW YORK,. Dec 3Lâ Dun's review
will say on January 4:
Marconi will call upon Governor General
Lord Minto to-morrow and on Thursday
a Cabinet meeting will be held to decide
what concessions can be granted to him
by the Dominion Government. â¢Â¦*;:,Â¦*,Â¦.
Mr. Laurier assured Marconi of every
assistance whi^h the Government could
afford him. Mr. Tarte, whose department
has control "of the coast telegraph sys
tem, discussed the establishment of wire
less stations on Prince Edward Island
and the mainland of Nova Scotia or New
Brunswick, to maintain communication
across Northumberland Strait, independ
ently of -the existing cable, controlled by
the Anglo- American Company under a
charter similar to the franchise which
enabled the company to interfere in
Newfoundland.
"The Government owns the island," re
plied Colonel Gourdeau. "and the Â¦Â¦ only
telegraph lino on it, and allows nobody
to land there without permission. It is
in cnarge of. a Governor, but we win
make you King."
Marconi is greatly Impressed with tne
situation of Safcie lslana as a site tor a
station from which to work acros3 tne
Atlantic with his- wireless. station on tno
coast of Cornwall. â¢ â¢ : .
: 'At the Marine Department he -talked
with the Deputy Minister and chief engl
reer upon the subject and was - pleased
to see by the great circle track which
was plotted lor nim on a North Atlantic
admiralty chart that a direct line be
tween Sable Island and the Cornwall
coast passes well out to seaward of the
Avalon peninsula of Newfoundland.
Maps 'and views of the island showing
the lighthouse towers that may be used
for signaling were presented, and Mr.
Marconi was promised absolute freedom
in the use of the island for his experi
ments. It is considered that Sable Island
will at any rate be valuable as a repeat
ing station for trans-Atlantic signals.
Marconi had his. first meeting with Mr.
Laurier, Premier of Canada, at luncheon
in the Rideau Club to-day, where both
were guests of AV. S. - Fielding, Minister
of ; Finance. S Other Cabinet Ministers
were present, also Sir Sandford Fleming,

Thomas Shaughnessy, president of the
Canadian Pacific Railway.
OTTAWA, Dec. 31.â In a conference
with Mr. Tarte, Minister of Public Works,

LINCOLN, Neb., Dec. -31.â Governor
Savage at 7 o'clock to-night granted an
unconditional pardon to Joseph S. Bart
ley, former State Treasurer, who, five
years ago, was- sentenced to twenty years
in the penitentiary on conviction of hav
ing embezzled $201,000 of State funds.: The
pardon went into effect from the moment
it was delivered to .Mrs. Bartley by the
Governor's private secretary. It was "pre
sented to Warden Davis at the peniten
tiary a half hour later,' andat 9 o'clock,
with his family and lawyers, Bartley was
brought In a carriage to his home in the
city. To newspaper men he said he Ead
no other immediate plans than to spend
the flrst day of the new year; with his
family. .
Bartley has been in the State prison for
four years and six months, in addition to
a year in the Douglas County jail; while
his appeal to the Supreme Court was
pending. His entire shortage Is alleged to
have been $550,000, but he was convicted
on the single count of embezzling $201,000.
Governor Savage makes an extended ex
planation of his reasons for granting the
pardon. Primarily, he says, he is led to
believe the ends of justice have been met
in the punishment already inflicted. Bart
ley, he says, was the State Treasurer at
a time when many Nebraska banks were
on the verge of collapse and it was with
the best intentions and to tide them over,
the Governor urges, that 'Â¦ Bartley ad
vanced them State money.' : - Â¦ " . '.

Manager Baird to-day voiced the sen
timent of Yost. He said the doughty llich
i*ran boys simply could not return to Ann

college people if their record of 501 to 0
was broken by even a two-point safety.
They fcave good cause to be uneasy, for
the Michigan men are as much out cf
their native element as a whale on land.
First, there is the radical change in
temperature. The climate is delicious,
buÂ£ \ttie quick change which the lads
from Ann Arbor must make is too much
toexpect in six days. In the second place
the Michigan men are accustomed to
playing on a turf gridiron. Never before
have they had anything to do with the

than "Michigan cannot help winning."

recorded in which odas of 10 to 1 are of *
fered that Stanford will not score.
Both teams are in splendid physical con
dition, each man is at the acme of his
training: and whatever the result may be
this afternoon the balance one way or the
other cannot be said to be due to over
training on either side. Another matter
about which there, is much guessing: is
the comparative weight of the two teams.
The official .weights are .given herewith,
and even a cursory glance will show that
neither team has. any advantage in this
regard worth mentioning. The line-up
will be as follows: . . .

There is an interesting story told as to
how Gregory, Michigan's great center,
happens to be with the team. He was at
Sta-nford In 1900 when Yost was coaching
the. cardinals. Owing to his scholastic
standing he could not play on the big
eleven. He played, on the second eleven
and made a brilliant showing. In an
argument with Yost on the field one day
during practice he struck the coach and
was not allowed to play thereafter. . ,
â¢ Yost recognized his ability and Induced
him* to go back to Ann Arbor, where he
is a. special student in the Law College.
He has played "center" on the team
throughout the season and has been a
tower of strength in the position.
Adherents of the Michigan team seem
to have no doubt as to the outcome of the
Michigan's Great Center.
and has never played football in a game
of any consequence, but he is a cool, level
headed youngster, knows the signals well
and may surprise some of his pessimistic
friends. However, when all tnat is good
has been said with reference to the sub
stitute quarterback still it must be ac
knowledged the position is the weakest
on the cardinal team.
Then there Is always the possibility of
flukes. Kluke3 from the point of view of
the bleachers are the 'most interesting
features of any game.. It gives just that
element of spicy interest which the public
palate requires. Flukes in football often
result in a complete change in the tide

It is certain that Tarpey will play quar

condition as to preclude his playing for
even live minutes. Tarpey has never

Captain T. A.. Nerney. and Commander
George W. Bauer, of the training, ship

Steamship Columbia Floated.
.-The .steamship ., Columbia,': which ran
aground near St. Helens,^ on- the, Columbia
"River, three I days . ago,-, was Â¦â¢ floated-yes
terday and continued on her way. frpni
Portland to Astoria and San Francisco.
When the Columbia ran ashore, a crew
was taken to the scene and the cargo was
temporarily transferred to lighters, .while
the passengers were returned to Portland
on the steamship Elder, which -happened
by. -So'far as has been learned the steam
ship suffered no damage, though- she
would j have been badly strained â¢ had . she
remained aground much longer. She was
on-the sandbar for. two days. The;disas
fter occurred during the prevalence of the
heaviest fog that has hung over the upper
river for years, and which completely tied
up shipping for three days.
Is 'Again in Commission.
" The German bark Willy Rlckmers is again
in 1 commission. She arrived here on April
21 last; from Hiogo in distress. : She had
been caught, in a- typhoon and >was dis
masted. Under jury masts she made" port
however; and was sent to the Union Iron
Works for repairs. Then came the -strike
and the long wait -for' material from the
Kast.- Finally the missing spars were re
placed and the. vessel got once more. into
trim. She has since been loaded, and will
probably sail for Queenstown to-day with
a cargo of wheat. â¢ <Â¦ .
beam ends" half a dozen times, and on
many occasions the- crew thought.- the
masts would roll out of her. For two
weeks the decks were awash and most
of the time there was from two to three
feet of water racing through the scup
pers, and members of the crew took their
lives in their hands every time they went
on the main deck. .
_ For twelve days the Carleton was off
Honolulu; and once she had a narrow
escape from going on Molokai. In his
effort to , wear ship Captain Amesbury
lost nearly an entire suit of sails, but. he
got . his vessel around,, nevertheless, and.
brought her into port. The Carleton was
badly battered, but not seriously dam
aged, and will be back here with a load
of sugar in another month or so. .
Captain Amesbury of the Carleton was
anxious to meet his brother, who is mas
ter of the Roanoke, in Honolulu. He was
.praying for favorable breezes, therefore,
when he left Tacoma,. but ran into a
storm that lasted^ thirty days. While the
Carleton was battling with the elements
the, Roanoke was speeding toward- San
Francisco before a favoring. breeze, so the
brothers did not meet. : If may, now. be
years before the -two brothers come to
gether again, as the Roanoke < on. her ar
rival here will load for New York,- while
the Carleton. on her return ; will probablv
BO to Australia. . : ' ;

Pleasure Reigns at Two
Leading Social
Clubs.
Unique Features of Pretty
Entertainments Are
Enjoyed.
Sidney Ehrman, who took the leading
part in the play, scored a pronounced hit.
The sieging of the club sextet was also a
prominent feature of the affair.
J. Dannenbaum, Â¦ Milton A- Bremer, Mrs.
Otto Irving Wise and Miss Hedwig Ros

closed with the grand annual ball while
1901 passed away and the new year was
born, Nearly 500 guests were present and
the reception was one of the most suc
cessful in the history of the Concordia.
The San Francisco Verein's celebration
of the advent of 1902 was similar to that
of its sister fraternity. About 300 mem
bers and guests were present. A pleasing
programme was rendered, Including vocal
and Instrumental music, a banquet and
the annual ball.
"In Honor Bound," a play In one act,
was given by members and friends of the
club. The cast was composed of Arthur

The mail boat brings some additional
particulars of the hard time the S. D.
Carleton had during her run from Puget
Sound to Honolulu. The Honolulu papers,
in an interview with Captain Amesbury,
make him say it was the - worst storm
he ever encountered in his twenty-eight
years of sea life. The vessel was on. her
The Alameda brought up thirty-six
cabin and forty-four steerage passen
gers. Her cargo is mainly composed of
sugar, coffee and- bananas, besides $10,000
In silver and $30,000 in gold. Early in the
afternoon the entire crew was paid oft.
and given a chance to go. up town and
buy New Year's presents. To-day the

less, taking six days and seven hours to
cover the 2100 miles. The reason for hor
early arrival â¢was due to ' the fact that
she left the inlands ahead of | time in
order to land her passengers in San
Francisco in time for New Year's day.
Some heavy northwest weather was ex

J year carpet offering 1
I The Pacific Coast representative of one of the largest carpet- mills in the â¢*Â¦"Â¦Â¦
world remarked to us the other day: "Well, you certainly have turned the little .1
carpet world of San Francisco upside down since you opened your carpet depart- I
ment, and with the 'others' it seems to be simply a case of 'follow on.'" I
R Be this as it may, the Breuner Carpet Store is surely one of the triumphs |
i of this big business. For years we contended that San Francisco . needed a really 1
I first-class carpet store â a store that would LEADâ a store that would make its B .
jj prices RIGHT and then hold to them hard and fast without "dickering"â a store |
Â£ that would treat ALL customers alike. Our tremendously successful nine' months' I
Â¦ carpet experience has proved that we were" correct' in our contention.: These facts /^|
B will not be news to those who keep track of events in the business; world, -but < to I
'jj those of you who have "' been "out of touch" with things they should prove g
| interesting. I
fi Beginning to-morrow morning, the first business day. of 1902,; and xontin- 1
1 uing until further notice, we shall offer OUR ENTIRE LINE of ; |
j " Roxbury" tapestry carpets I
1 at 75 cents the yard I
y sewed, lined and laid on your floor. There will not be the slightest suspicion of - 1 |
I a string on this offer. We have been holding a, certain number of patterns here- |
I tofore at 75 cents â now the entire line is yours at that* figure. As much â¢ as you . |
k want, or as little as you want. ' ' â¢ '
a Remember this! We are building our business for a long, s long future. We |
Â¦ want your trade not alone for to-morrow, but for next week, next month and for the I
years to come. Under ' these' circumstances we are bound to give you the best I
I values and the best treatment that- it is possible to- give. ..And above all, bear in; I-
i mind that our newspaper statements will ALWAYS be backed up in the store. 1
'Â¦ A prosperous New Year to you, one and all! . , .1

Reports from Europe have long* since made the
reading public of the United States fairly familiar
with the trade conditions and prospects of the lead
ing nations. Great- Britain has had the disadvantage
of a prolonged and costly-war, but out of it has
drawn something of good. The large expenditures
necessary for carrying on the war have stimulated
many lines of industry, while the number of unem
ployed has been diminished by the enlistment of men
required for the army. . Consequently, despite the
disasters of the war and the heavier taxation it has
imposed upon the people, the holiday season this
year .-has not been so bad in Great Britain as on the
Continent. -. ,

CLEVER WOMEN WHO AIDED IN THE PRODUCTION OF "THE COLONIAL DAMES." WRITTEN ' Bl' TWO
MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA CLUB, AND WHICH . WAS THE FEATURE OF THE FOUNDERS' DAY
ENTERTAINMENT GIVEN* BY THAT ORGANIZATION.
The American farmer has to earn his bread before
he eatsjt, and is under no moral obligation to divide
. his loaf or give it all to a tropical people, who can
live with less work than he must perform.
The Export circular dwells fervently upon our
moral obligation to Cuba. We are under none. We
are under the political obligation and pledge to- let
her become independent, that her people may work
out their own destiny, as we have ours.. .;'â¢.-,
It is a novelty in American politics that the War
Department appears as the country's guide, philoso
pher and friend in its economic policy. The Secre
tary of War inÂ»his last report says that "the inde
pendence of Cuba is necessary to the safety of the
United Stales." We accept that saying for what it
is worth. Let Cuba have the independence which
we declared she had achieved before we struck a
blow in her behalf, and being independent let her
make such trade arrangements as may promote her
welfare, with the whole world. Last year she im
ported far more Â»fronv other countries than from the
United Slates, and if she took all of her imports
from us their annual profit would be an inadequate
â¢ substitute for the Â¦ destruction of two of our important
Agricultural industries. . \ *
It will be seen, therefore, that if the Export ad
junct to the junta hath tears to shed over our im
periled export trade it should devote them to wash
ing away the countervailing duty on German sugar
and not grieve over the less than 2 per cent that we
send to Cuba. .
JHE Cuban junta sends out, via the United
States Export Association, its plea for free
trade in sugar and tobacco.
The' statements of this document are misleading.
It says: "Our duties on Cuban products, sugar and
tobacco, are about ioc per cent as against' an aver
age of 50 per cent on all dutiable products imported
into the United States from other countries; while
the. Cuban duties on our , products entering Cuba
average less than 25 per cent."
This is plainly intended to make it appear that we
discriminate specially against Cuba in our tariff,
which is not true. Her sugar and tobacco pay the
same as other sugar and tobacco, except in the case
of sugar produced by the bounty paying nations,
when we add the bounty to our tariff, which gives
the non-bounty sugar of Cuba an advantage of 2
cents a pound over the bounty sugar of Germany.
The low Cuban tariff is. cited as a reason why we
should lower or remove ours. m Inasmuch as the Cu
ban tariff is fixed by our Secretary of War, who joins
the junta in using it as an argument for free trade,
we answer that if it be too" low the Secretary has
done injustice to Cuba, which he cannot plead as a
reason why more injustice shall be done to the
American sugar and tobacco interests.
â¢ Our exports to Cub? for 1900 amounted to 1.9 per
cent of our total export trade, while we sent to Ger
many 13.44 per cent of our total exports. Yet, to
protect American sugar we put on Germany a pro
hibitory dcty by adding her sugar bounty to our
tariff, and thereby imperiled our export trade to her,
which amounted to $i87,347.88o.-

CON DITION OP THE NATION?:'
Of each year we expect great things because men dare to disregard the failures of
others as proof that what they tried and did not \vas* impossible, and because, too, .men
refuse to. accept success in any matter as the end of it, and fearlessly put their hands to
greater achievement. Morse did not scruple to deny that/ Franklin had reached the
limit of knowledge as to the power and adaptation of electricity when he inverited the,
lightning rod to defend man against it. He made the strange power a servant and
chained it to a wire. ' Graham , refused /to accept Morse's success as the end, and the
world has the telephone. Then , came Marconi, discarding both Morse and Xjraham as
the ultimate/ and we have electricity talking through the air, a wireless bond between
continents. : . , â¢ : , , â¢*
So, as men pledge health and happiness at the new- year! there is intheir greeting i
this spirit of a noble of what has been; It is the buoyance that gives zest
to the outlook and fervor to the daw , ' i
'Â¦ Â¦ The world refuses to believe that the past had all of anything. If it believed other- 1
wise the future' would have no radiance: If the dead hand were upon all human concerns
what a stagnant world it would.be and how insipid the life of man!'
This seems to be the philosophical basis; of that : raised' and light-winged spirit
which gives to this day its intertst and its pleasure. /Even the poor creatures who- der
vote it to grossness and excess are blindly seeking to I give expression to " tlnii spirit,
.which they-. feel' without understanding. Let us be charitable to their transgressions, for
their motive -is kin to the highest. .'â¢Â¦ v
A hundred years ago, in 'the good year 1 86 1; there were men- who believed the
world stood on the last summit; that in science, invention, art and philosophy the last
page had been turned in the book of knowledge. But since then illuminating gas., the
steamship, railway, telegraph, telephone, the wizard of the wireless air, electric light and.
power, the pneumatic transmitter, the machine harvester and thresher, and - sewing
machine, and the greatcompany of kindred discoveries and inventions, cause us , to look
back in wonder upon simple-minded 1801; riding on a wagon, reaping with a sickle
and threshing with a flail, stitching with a hand needle by the light of a tallow dip, and
proud of the sailors who would voyage from Europe hither in less than two months!'
All. of it came in the refusal of men to accept the complacence of 1801..,Self-satis
fied old year, buried with a hundred dead, companions, we respect , your memory and
pay tribute to it when we inscribe your epitaph: "Sacred to the memory of 1801; the
year that did not know it all." But while we write, something tells us that a hundred years
hence another hand will write that inscription over 1 901 and its company of the dead,
and the century which it led will rest and rust, lost in that long perspective, that reaches
back to the concert of the morning stars, and the faces of men/ still turned to the future,
will shine with its increasing light.
Optimism, courage, adventure, are the quenchless qualities of man which distin
guish him from the brutes that perish. He will not chain himself to a creed, nor formula,
Individualized, how valuable is this disposition in man! The year past had its
sorrows, its failures, but those who suffered them look forward to-day, expecting to rise
from every fall. Those who knew good fortune only, refuse to rest with that, but plan
for greater things, and in the combination generate the great energy and enterprise which
speak to the children of men, that they go forward. Here, in this hew land, is 1 the theater
and seat of American optimism. In.' no other.' part; of ; ;the world of, the
new year a force as active. Men expect fortunes out of mines that failed for others, and
get them. They sail argosies where the ships of the past went to the bottom.'. They seek
and find wealth where others lost it. They wed the blossoms and create three fruits
where only two ripened before.^f it be said that summits are impossible to the transit
of commerce, they scale or tunnel'them, and commerce, rejoices in the new pathway. If
others think that deserts are barren and shine .only to lure and kill, here men enter
them, clad in courage, and- : bring back from the mirage' riches that would dazzle a prince.
This is the American orient, the land of the new year, - â¢''â¢Â¦
1 Every one is an argonaut, and nature provides a golden fleece for every seeker.
It is good to be here, and The Call greets its friends and their households,, with
congratulations that their lines, are cast" and their lot fixed in a place where to-morrow is
bigger with promise and brighter than to-day, and the gifts and graces of to-day cause
yesterday to be forgotten; Â¦ ' ' . .; \'- Â¦ Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦Â¦' ' '; /. . - â¢ .

THE LANp OF EDUCATION.
> ' â¢ . < â¢ ' Â¦ ' ' ',Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦'.
DR.. EATON, formerly president of Beloit Col-^
lege, after having spent a year in carefully
studying the conditions of university in
struction abroad has announced that the means lor
higher education arc being improved much more
rapidly in the United States than in Germany, and
that on the whole there are even now better provi
sions for such education here than in the land which
tor so long a time has held undisputed the foremost
place in the educational world.*
The strength of the German system lies in the de-^
velopment of specialists, but the system has tended
to produce a race of scientists who have a higher re
gard for knowledge itself- than for any use to which
it may be put. Thus German instruction does not
always tend to practical results. Dr. Eaton, in speak
ing of Germany, says: "Her great professors,
whether surgeons, chemists, theologians, philoso
phers or historians; have 'still to learn the art 'of ',
translating for the student mind the wealth of wis
dom with which they themselves* are supplied.' The
German professor lacks the personal magnetism and
power to attract his students vyhich is so characteris
tic of the American college professor."
It is not, however, in personal influence only that
American universities are, surpassing the. renowned
seats of learnmg in Europe. Thanks to the munifi
cent endowments' granted by States to their univer
sities, or bestowed by munificent millionaires, /'the'
wealthier American universities now offer to,- students
better facilities for study ' than can be found else
where. "In physical equipment," says Dr. Eaton)
"the German institutions are far behind what we
know at home. ' Leipsic alone of all the great schools
has a modernized plant. The other universities. have
been content with indifferent extensions .'of : their,
libraries and laboratories. Student, life here also,
travels, on uncompromisingly traditional lines. An'
American is gratified to s observe, however, that the ,
seriousness of purpose, lack of which Europeans' are
prone to charge against us on account; of our ,exces;
si vc indulgence in detracting influences like; athletics,]
is found here absolutely in.no more, marked degree
than in the United States. . On" the contrary there r is
a unification of student life on the gridirons and dia
monds of American campuses which.no amount, of
'kommers' and saber dueling will , ever : produce." â¢_ .
Of late ' years we have . heard so miich^ about the ';
absorption of the -American intellect in/business, and
our" inferiority to the Old World in higher education,
that this statement of a careful student and expert- in
educational i matters is particularly gratifying. Stu
dents have been -coming from .Great Britain for some
time 1 to study in American schools of technology,
and now there seems a prospect that ere long ; they -
wiHcornVfrom Germany, to take' courses of higher
.education in^o'.tr juniyersitie* . .â¢â¢ .,'>_ :.:â¢_

for the fixing of water rates for

pure and wholesome supply of water. Th'.s
i3 to enable the board to establish a basis

â¢The Board of Health was directed to
make chemical and bacteriological analy
ses of the waters of all wells within 'the
city acd county, the geographical-situa

Mayor Phelan stated that City Attor
ney Lane was making an inquiry whether
the present city officials hold until Jan
uary 8, 1902. 2 They took ! office for two
years on January 8, 1900, and there ls
some doubt whether their successors can
assume office on January 6, 1902, which is
the first 1 Monday in January, or on, Jan
uary 8, 1902. The board adjourned to meet
at 10:30 a. m. next Monday. , Mayor Phe
lan then introduced to the members of
the board his successor. Mayor-elect
Schmitz, who had been an interested ob
server of the uroceedings.
your committee should not be allowed to go
before the people for re-election. Afraid him- 1
self to' seek for Vindication, he demanded that
your chairman be given up as a victim to his
spite and venom.- It was the littlest and mean
est act seen in local politics for many a year.
.For over ;a ' year and a half, according to
Mr. : Grunsky, your chairman has been followed
by. the animosity of the , Mayor. , Against his
spiteful misrepresentations. Chairman Reed of
the Public Utilities- Committee appeals to the
people- of .San. Francisco to say whether he has
not served them earnestly and faithfully.
conclusion, gentlemen, while the chair
man of your committee cannot bring himself
to assert that the. Board of Public Works and
the City. Engineer are acting in bad faith In
withholding Information from the Supervisors
that is theirs as a matter of right, or that they
are deliberately planning to make the cost of
the water supply too high to be accepted by
the people, he does say that the figures of Mr.
Wagoner have been padded by millions of dol
lars, as an inspection of the report will show;
he does . say that the cost of bringing in suffi
cient water has been increased unnecessarily
by over ten- millions of dollars and that the
operating expenses of the proposed system are
too great by over $150,000 annually.
Another Report on Tuolumne.
The facts proving these statements are em
bodied In the report which will be filed by you*
chairman in the next five daya^ This report has
been compiled with the assistance of several
engineers of high standing, who have been gen
erous in giving help and information withheld
by the Board of Public Works.
"When I say." said Reed, after finishing
the reading, "that on account of the
Mayor's animosity and ill will I was de
feated for a renomination . before the
Democratic convention I say what is true:
when I say that the estimate of cost of
the Tuolumne project was raised from
$28,000,000 to $38,000,000 and that the esti
mate Is too high, I state what is true."
"I deny all Mr. Reed's allegations
wherein they are material,", said the
Mayor, "and will let the matter rest with
the board," and the incident was closed.
SITE REMAINS
TO BE SELECTED
Location for Detention
Hospital Is Still
Undecided.
Â¦ Â¦Â¦...-. â¢ ;
; No action has as yet been taken by the
Health and Hospital Committee of the
Board of Supervisors' regarding the selec
tion of a site for the proposed detention
hospital." The Board of Public Works has
under consideration plans : for building a
road ' to one of ' the places " offered.*,; Al
though many natural obstacles make .the
second site seem unavailable, the Board
of 'Public Works is still struggling, with
the figures. ' .
When the Pattrldge property. was first
proposed there was considerable objection
made by neighbors. These; are. five in
number,, and the nearest house, In which
the original protestant lives, is fully 500
yards away from the extreme edge of the
property, whose purchase is under consid
eration. From : the other, side of ; an arm
of the bay a protest has been made by
the proprietor of a chemical ' works, | fully
a mile. away. This -practically comprises
the population of the neighborhood. ..
F. W. Dohrmann while president of _ the
Merchants' -Association gave his unquali
fied approval of the Pattridge site. . Ho
was followed by S>ank J. Symmes, who
after an - investigation called it "an ideal
spot.V Those in a position \ to khow v de
clare that politics is a potent factor in
preventing the procurement . of a site.
State Senator Walsh . is Â« at > the â¢ head of
those who are Â¦ endeavoring to
the property "over the -hill,'.' as is called
the land offered by the Bay View Land
Company.'
The engineers of the Board 1 of Public"
Works were busy yesterday surveying the
second property offered. Â¦ It will probably
devolve .upon the incoming Board'of'Su
pervisors to decide upon' the site. â¢.-â¢â¢.
When the late Democratic municipal con
vention assembled, j as sole owner by right of
discovery of that close corporation, the Mayor
of this city demanded that the chairman of
Heed's Nomination Prevented.
Reed attempted to speak, but the Mayor
said he had ordered the roll call and ruled
Reed out of order. Reed appealed from
the decision, but there was no second to
his motion. Reed was told by the Mayor
that he could speak In explanation of his
vote. Reed thereupon stole a march by
reading the rest of his communication
from where the clerk, had left off, as fol
lows:
"It is not- a minority report," said
Comte, 1 "but' a- libelous communication,
and I think ' that a motion to return it
ls highly proper."
"The communication was allowed to be
read as a matter of courtesy," said Phe
lan, "but it appears to some member that
it is blackguardly and offensive, and I
shall put the motion to return' It to the
author."
These words were used to belittle the ef
forts of your chairman to have an early inves
tigation of the Spring Valley Water Company's
property. No words 1 can sufficiently express
the malicious epitefulness'Of such action com
ing from the Mayor of a great city; and pub
lished, as your. -chairman Is assured; at , so

At this ,pointJCbmtftjnbved thai further
reading of the communication be discon
tinued and that it -be returned to the
author. â¢,.'.> , '
Declares Mayor Was Spiteful.
The communication then, refers to a
published article signed by Mayor Phe
lan to the effect that the hand of the
Spring Valley Water Company is visible
in the proceedings relative to the fixing
of this year's water rates, and continues:
1 Your chairman believes that the reflections
Â¦were inspired by malice and- made in order to
discredit the chairman of your Â¦committee be
fore he could ehow that the estimates oÂ£. Mr.
Wagoner had been unnecessarily raised, and
that the plans and estimates submitted by the
City Engineer are too high by .many millions of
dollars. The burden of the City Engineer's at
tack was that the report of Wagoner had been
withheld because he believed it had
been asked for in bad faith and
was desired only as a means of harassing
him. The reply is that the. report cannot
be used as a means of harassing the City En
gineer unless he has unnecessarily and unjus
tifiably Increased the estimates made by Wag
oner. The City Engineer then went on to say
that for a year and a half he had purposely
withheld from . your chairman whatever Infor
mation he had on the subject of public utilities,
because he feared that the chairman of your
committee would make It public and thus de
feat the plans of the Board of Public Works to
file on the water rights on the Tuolumne. At
the same time the City Engineer vigorously
asserted' that he had Invited your chairman to
go to ' the headwaters of the- Tuolumne with
him. and had requested your chairman to be
present at meetings in the Mayor's office when
the plans of the Board of Public Works would
be discussed fully and that your chairman had
refused to meet him anywhere except in the
zoom of the Board of Supervisors.
Says Malice Inspired Reflections.
"I desire that the report be read," said
Reed. "Attacks have been made Â¦ on my
personal Integrity by certain members of
the Board or> Public Works. These at
tacks were instigated, I am informed, by
his Honor the -Mayor, and my report as
chairman of the committee is- in the na
ture of a- reply." : ' . " Â¦Â¦â¢â¢Â¦Â¦ - . â¢
The Mayor was averse to' receiving tho
report as such, but allowed it to be read
as a personal communication from Reed,
which was done. The communication re
lated the history of the proceedings of
the Utilities Committee at last Friday's
meeting', when the report of '.Engineer
Luther Wagoner, who had estimated the
cost of the Tuolumne River project at
$28,000,000, was reluctantly produced by
City Engineer Grunsky, who had figured
It at $38,000,000. Referring to certain per
sonal reflections made by Grunsky the
communication says: Â¦Â¦
Reed. While there was no blood
spilled the two belligerents took occa
sion to say unkind things about each
other before retiring from office. -.Reed,
both in speech and by communication, ac
cused the Mayor "of Instigating the at
tacks upon him by, the engineers in -the
Board of Works. The trouble commenced
when Reed presented a minority report
of the Public Utilities Committee on the
raise of the Tuolumne River supply esti
mate by City Engineer Grunsky. Mayor
Phelan refused to accept it because It was
not signed by a majority of the com
mittee.

The yearly report of A. G. McAdie. section
director of the climate and crop service of
the Weather Bureau, Is as follows:
It may be stated at the beginning that the
year was one of large ! yields and generally fa
vorable climatic conditions. A fair crop was
harvested and marketed at satisfactory figures.
Farmers made money, both because of the ex
cellent weather conditions and good markets.
Shipments of fresh deciduous fruits during the
season of Â»1901 were estimated at 170,000,000
pounds. Some of the details of the growing
season follow:
; Oranges, of excellent Quality were plentiful
in January, and the crop has not been serious
ly injured by frosts. Almonds and peaches
were In bloom by the 4th of February, and
peaches, cherries and apricots were blossom
ing by the '25th. Several thousand acres of
grain were washed out by the heavy rains dur
ing February. Deciduous fruit trees were in
full bloom by the 4th of March, and work had
commenced in the bop fields. Wheat had com
menced heading out by March 18. -
Frosts early in April caused great damage
to deciduous fruits, and severe hall storms in
jured fiuit trees. Haying commenced about
' the 15th. and cherries and strawberries were
â¢shipped from the Sacramento Valley. Olive
picking was in progress in the vicinity' or Banr
Diego by the 22d of April and vineyards were
In excellent condition. Severe frosts on the
20th aiid 27th in the coast and bay sections
Injured nearly all varieties of deciduous fruits
and grapee.
â¢ Grain harvest commenced in portions of thÂ«
San Joaquin Valley about the 15th of May.
I'eaches, cherries and apricots were being ship
lied before the close of May from Yolo and
Holano counties. Conditions thus far had been
favorable for citrus fruits and walnuts.
High temperatures prevailed early in June;
greatly to the benefit of grain and hay. Heavy
irosts about the 12th of June damaged corn,
potatoes end garden vegetables in portions ot
the northern counties, but did not injure fruits
Rapid progress was made joward the close of
the month in harvesting ' grain and hay. Pros
pÂ«pts were good for the largest crop of sugar
beets ever gathered in Southern California.
The vineyardists in portions of the Santa Clara
Valley reported the loss â¢ of many of the older
grapevines, and the three preceding dry years
were given as the cause. Abnormally high
temperatures prevailed throughout the Etate
at the close of June, but caused no material
damage to crops. Fires In the San Joaquin
Valley destroyed many large fields of grain
a/id much pasturage.
During the month of July conditions were
very favorable lor matujing grain and decid
uous fruit crops and for the growth of eugar
bc*ts, hops, corn, beans and vegetables. Har
vesting and threshing progressed rapidly and
large crops of grain and hay were gathered
both of excellent quality. The yield' of apri
cots and prunes was generally below .'average
and other deciduous < fruits were - not proving
as good crops as had been . expected. Apples
were looking well and gave promise of a heavy
crop.- Grape picking had commenced 1 in tome
sections 'before the end of July, s and thÂ« vine
yards were in good condition.' Â¦-â¢Â¦, Â¦
Extreme heat during the early.' part" of Au
gust seriously injured Tokay grapes, but : im
proved the condition of other. fruits and bent-.

Receipts of Produce.
Mall advices from -New York say: "There
â¢was practically no trade in the local circles
Tuesday and the market was unchanged. Cur
rents were rather unsettled, owing to the prob
able arrival this week of the Miramar with
19,000 bbls and the widely varying views of
different receivers as to the outlook, but actual
spot prices for Amalias in barrels held steady
at 5%@5%c. with cleaned in cartons quoted
from 6%Â®7c. Amalias to arrive were offered
from 5 7-16@5%c. and cleaned In cartons after
the arrival of- the Miramar at 6%c. Raisins
were very dull on spot, with offerings general
ly withdrawn on the coast- New crop Santa
Clara prunes were unchanged from a 3%@3%c
basis. A coast dispatch reported a sale to "a
large packer of about 200 cars old crop at a
~%c basis for Santa Claras. This, if confirmed,
Â¦will undoubtedly cause a further advance in
Ihe California market. Oregon prunes are
quoted on the coast at a basis price of 2%c,
with some goods now en route still offering as
low as a 2 '4 c basis. Spot prunes were very
quiet, but the feeling is one of confidence in
the market. Apricots and peaches were steady
Fancy cnpeeled Muire in 1-lb wooden boxes

The first week in December was marked by
unusually high temperatures, and followed by
cold weather, severe frosts, fogs and rain, con
tinuing until about the 20th. The cooler
weather was beneficial hi checking too rapid
development of . fruit buds. Oranges not , pro
tected by smudging and fire baskets were con
siderably damaged by frosts, - but as ample
warning had been given, the loss was compar
atively light. Young orange orchards, nursery
stock and vegetables were badly damaered.
Grain and preen feed continued In excellent
condition. Dry, â¢ northerly winds prevailed
toward the close of December, absorbing much
of the moisture in the' soil and causing farm
ers great uneasinesx, particularly. In the South
ern districts. On the 27th -an. unusually severe
"Santa Ana" or dust storm occurred through
out Southern California, accompanied by high
winds, causing Rxeat damage. Oranges . were
blown from the trees and many trees were up
rooted. This report closes too early for an
accurate estimate of the losses sustained.
The temperature and rainfall during the
month of November were both above normal,
and conditions were very favorable for secur
ing the outstanding crops. The raisin season
closed before the middle of the month.
Through the timely warnings : from | the sec
tion center, the crop was well . protected from
the frequent rains, and the loss fas quite in
significant. The season was a very successful
one. the yield being fully up to the average in
many places and the quality of the raisins su
perior. Oranges were bciDg gathered and ship
ped in considerable quantities; the yield was
about average and the quality excellent. Olive
picking and pickling were in progress. Early
wheat was in excellent condition and making
rapid growth. The soil was in good condition
and farmers were engaged in plowing and seed
ing. Some sections reported that the grain
acreage would probably exceed that of last
year. New grass Â¦ was abundant, and stock
were in~ good condition. Beans were not as
badly damaged by* rain as had been reported,
and the crop turned out very fair.
The temperature during October was consid
erably, above normal and from the 10th to 12th
extremely warn weather prevailed in the coast
and bay sections. The , rainfall during the
month was slightly above' normal and in
Southern California it was the heaviest for
several years during October. Grain, hay,
beans and late grapes were considerably dam
aged by rain, but other crops were benefited
and pasturage was' greatly Improved. Fires
caused considerable damage in the timber lands
about Pacific Grove and Salinas and destroyed
many acres of grazing lands in other places.
Apples were yielding a better crop than for
several years. Walnut harvest was progress
ing, with excellent results. Prospects con
tinued good for a large crop of oranges and
olives. The raisin crop was nearly all cured
and moving to packing houses. An immense
crop of celery was being raised along the
Santa Ana River in Orange County. The sea
son for . grain, beans and sugar beets practi
cally closed in most sections during the latter
part of October, and excellent returns were
the rule. Plowing, seeding and tree pruning
were in progress in many places.
Nearly normal weather conditions prevailed
during the month of September. In a few ex
posed places , light frosts injured potatoes,
beans and vegetables " to some extent during
the first week of the month, and heavy rains
toward the close caused some damage to grain
in sacks, unbaled hay. beans and hops. There
was an unusually heavy fall of snow in the
mountain districts on the 23d and 24th. Raisin
drying progressed . satisfactorily, and as ample
warninge of rain were given, the damage to
the crop was very light. Shipments Â«of grain
and hay were greatly regarded by the Â¦ labor
troubles at San Francisco, and immense quan
tities of grain were stacked up along the rail
road tracks. The season practically closed
Â¦without disastrous northers, and with the de
sired early fall rains.
and northern sections were greatly endangered
by the lack of shipping facilities caused by the
San Francisco labor troubles,* and in some
places the loss on perishable fruit was quite
serious. Very light crops of wheat and bar
ley were harvested in Southern California.
Cooler weather toward the close of August re
tarded the ripening of grapes and late decidu
ous fruits. Â¦ Hops, beans and sugar beets were
being harvested, and all were yielding excel
lent crops. , . .Â¦ '

back for New Year's, when "." the demand Is
never as good as it is at Christmas. The re

NEW -YORK. Dec: 31.â Cotton closed quiet,
2 to 13 points higher..
Nezu : York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 31. âThe year closed on
the Stock Exchange with. a. demonstration of
confidence in the substantial .basis of values.
The - immediate factors were somewhat ! con
flicting and . the early market was irregular
in consequence, but the buying demand cleared
the market of offerings and .':. carried prices
to a higher level during the course of the day.
. The publication of yearly summaries \ showing
a record of achievements in excess ot any
previous year had a, strong sentimental effect
on trading. â¢ Confidence "was general that
the turn of the year would see a relaxation
Jn the money markets, . allowing means Â¦ for
speculation to express'its confidence by pur
chase of stocks. The money market was
again decidedly stringent to-day and very ac
tive, the rate going to 15 per cent early in the
day and hovering about that point at later
periods. The.shifting of loans forced* some
holders of stocks to throw them over, but
other buyers who seemed to be provided with
ample funds which were not affected by the
shifting of call loans were' ready ~ to take "
. them. The activity in the call loan market,
however, was attributed in part to the secur
ing of Â¦ means for the large buying of stocks
which was again in evidence and which was
rather better distributed than that of yester
day. Preparations for the heavy annual dis
bursements were the largest factor in the
strength of the money market. The Coalers
continued very active and in the main firm,
although there was a very large amount of
lealizing in Reading. - v It was considered sig
nificant that the brokers who were heavy
buyers of Reading yesterday took large
amounts of Baltimore and Ohio to-day.
A sharp reaction in Sugar was a contributing
cause to early, heaviness of the market, with
the break extending over three points. Grant
ing of a temporary injunction against the pro
posed retirement of Northen 'Pacific preferred
stock caused some depression. among - the Pa-"
cine stocks. An offer; made by Â¦. J. P. Mor
gan & Co. during the Â¦ day' to pay par for
Northern'Pacific preferred had the effect of
allaying some of the apprehension that the
formation of the Northern Securities Company
would be effectively obstructed. The apepar
ance of the November statement of net re
turns of the Union Pacific, showing a large
increase, was a factor.in relieving depression
in that part of the market. ' The November
statement of Reading's net earnings following
that for Erie, published yesterday, confirmed
the confidence in the .Coalers. The Erie's
somewhat supplanted the Readings in strength
and activity and Lackawanna was lifted' 7%
points. Late in the day New York Central*
selling minus the dividend, rose 2% over last
night. Baltimore and Ohio gained as much.
There was a vigorous recovery in Sugar,
which carried It more than a point over last
night, and Amalgamated Copper also rallied
strongly. Sterling exchange became easie- in
response to the higher money rate here. This
served to soothe the fear\ that gold may go
out early in January. Foreign'money mar
kets also reflected' a confidence'in', a prompt
lelaxation of money rates after January 1. It
is not expected - that there will be a notable
relaxation in money rates in New .York until
well into, the coming month. Profit-taking
made the closing easy and considerably below
the best. . . . >

STOCK MARKET.
! CHICAGO, Dec. 31.â On the whole, though
fairly active, wheat, was only a scalping: affair,
operating under local conditions. There , was
only a small amount of outside business, , due
largely to a . general timidity against carrying
anything . over the holiday to-morrow. TThe
bearish feature was the disappointing: tone of
the cables. *'. Liverpool was up, but not enough
to reflect the strength v here yesterday, : and
traders took it for a sign to unload what they
acquired yesterday. Some local bulls took ad
vantage of the nervousness Â« of sellers and
bought In. at the lower opening figures. This
brought -a quick reaction and an advance,
which,' however, was quickly lost on more sell
ing ' at the advance. May opened. %c to %c
lower at -82c to 81%c, - sold up : to 82^c and
back again to 81%@81%c. The last hour of
trade was dull and even the close for May was
steady and unchanged at 82%c.'-;> - . >Â¦
Corn followed closely, after wheat. The fea-'
ture of . the * session was the selling by houses
that bought yesterday. May closed steady, %c
down, at 66%c..-- 'â¢ " /.-.- : .
Â¦ Oats were sympathetic with the other cereals
early, but later sellers became uneasy and
wanted back the stuff they had put out. May
closed %c up,. at 45%c. - ' .'.,'.
Provisions were rather active, though weaker
on very Â¦ heavy, hog receipts Â¦ and correspond

At the offices of the firm it was learned
yesterday that W. Loaiza, the principal
member of the firm, was in Mexico, and
that the other partners were without any
Information In the matter.
Mexican Consul General Coney said yes
terday that his Government imposed an
export tax of 10 per cent on all gold and
silver bullion sent out of the country. At
the office of Collector of the Port Strat
ton the information was given that the
United States Government had not seized
the gold because the owner had smuggled
it out of Mexico, but because .he had
failed to pay the war tax of $5 on a free
entry, as required by law.
It Is thought that the treasury officials
will order the gold released on payment
of a nominal fine, similar action having
been taken six months ago when a con
signment of gold to Loaiza & Co. was
seized on the Mexican border under the
same circumstances.
Information was received in the city
yesterday that the consignment of smug
gled gold bullion confiscated at Tucson,
Ariz., on Monday by treasury agents was
destined for the firm of W. Loaiza & Co.,

LONDON, Dec. 31.â Lord Kitchener, un
der date of Johannesburg, December 30,
tends a weekly budget showing that since
December 23 live Boers have been killed,
live wounded, twenty-five taken prisoners
and fifty-one surrendered. These, says
the commander-in-chief . do not include
Dewefs losses in his attacks on Dargell
and Firman, when, it is reliably esti
mated, fifty were killed and fifty
wounded.
Dewet is still in the vicinity of Lang
berg. Colonel Spencer and Colonel Plum
er came in contact. December 28, with
Brltz's commando and took twenty-seven
prisoners. General Bruce Hamilton came
in touch with Grobelar's commando near
Marydale. December 23. He killed four
Boers and captured twenty-seven.
Newspaper correspondents in Pretoria
continue to send warnings of the need of
more reinforcements. Lord Kitchener is
turning the artillerymen, who have been
become disengaged by reason of the re
turn home of the heavy guns, into three
corps of mounted infantry, each . 150
strong.
Independent accounts of the Boer at
tack on Colonel Firman's camp on De
cember 24 add little to the official story
of the occurrence, except that General De
wet's 1500 men, as at Majuba, removed
their boots, climbed the precipice without
noise and completely surprised the sleep

lasted barely half an hour. Three more

It was paid to-night that while Dr.
Loeb s experiments in prolonging life
v.ere important and interesting: thus far
tney were applicable only in the case of
a fetnple animal cell, and therefore of
narrow limitation.
Another paper which attracted special
attention was that read before the
meeting of the Bacteriological So
ciety by Professor F. O. Novy
of the University of Michigan, who
made public for the first time the
result of his struggle to find a per
fect germicide. His results as reported
were beyond expectation, for he has, it
is asserted, discovered an organic per
ox.de which Is absolutelv destructive of
organic life, and which can be taken into
tiie system of human beings with perfect
A number of experiments were de
scribed by Professor Novy to demon
strate the power of his germicide, which
he cails "benzol." Germs to the multi
tude of one billion in saliva were lmme
diaxely killed. The throat of a diphthe
retic dog was sprayed with it and the
<log was cured more speedily than by
the anti-toxin treatment. The drug Is in
the form of volatile crystals, which are
soluble In -water.

Ey these facts chemical stimulation Is
jho*T. to be identical with electrical. When
ever in any. put of a nerve the negative par
ticles are iu excess the nerve is stimulated.
All positive!;- charged ions reduce irritability In
thi nerves; negative increase it.
Nerves consisting of a eollodial solution are
cumulated by the passage of the eollodial par
ticles from the condition of solution to that of
gelatine, which change is produced by the
action of electrically charged atoms which bear
negative charges. The stimulating action of
any chemical compound depends on these nega
tive charges; the particle* of the nerve are
held :n solution by positively charged groups
of atoms such as sodium, potassium, etc., and
the eSectivtawf of these ions in preventing
stimulation varies with the number of positive
ih*ifeÂ£ they bear.
He first set to work to Investigate along
the lines of parthenogenesis, or artificial
reproduction, and discovered that the
electric "ion" was responsible. Then he
took up the study of the cause for the
rhythmic beat, of the heart, and again
traced the agent to the same source.
When, with the aid of Professor Math
ews. the same causes were discovered to
be behind the secret of nerve action, the
Feries was complete and the savant's am
bition attained.
Professor Mathews said:
-A ""Ion," he explained, is an atom or
group of atoms carrying a charge of elec
tricity.
The announcement that electricity and
not heat is the life energy is the climax
of Professor Loeb s experiments, which
have extended over ten years. He wes
first led into this line of research by the
observation that electricity was able tc
affect protoplasm in a more universal
manner than any other stimulus. He then
came to the conclusion that if electricity
was able to have such effects in the form
of currents it ought to have like results
when in the form of '"ions."
Climax of Sis experiments.
First, that th? muscles contracted rhythmi
cally in solutions which had these electrical
charge in them, and second, that the contrac
tion of the muscles depended on the number
of charges on the different ions.
Dr. Loeb described his experiments wit!,
a Jel'.ytish, and explained that when he
placca the fish into a solution electrically
charged, such as salt, it responded, while
when he subjected It to a solution that
was a non-conductor it did not respond.
1-rom further experiments he found:
The energy of foofl^tuffs and the motions of
the heart are not, after c!l, due to the produc
tion of heat, but to the chemical energy In
electrically charged molecules. A part of the
chemical energy of foodstuffs is transformed
into electrical energy, which in turn gives
energy to the muscles and organs of the bodj.

saulted and robbed Mrs. N. J. . Foote In
her apartments at the . Elysium, 566
Geary street, early Sunday morning.
Gus Miller, a hackman, whose stand is
on Market street, opposite Seventh,
identified Galvin in the City Pris
on. His statement was that shortly
after midnight Sunday morning he
received a call by., telephone to go
to the Fulton House, on Larkin street.
He . drove there and met Galvin, who
asked him to drive to 30 Fourth street.
He drove Galvin there, the latter remain
ing In the saloon from ten to fifteen min
utes. He'came out and ordered Miller to
drive ' him back - to the â¢ Fulton House.
When they reached' that place Galvin
went upctalrs 'and returned , with Anita
Clark, the woman who was arrested Mon
day, and an elderly - woman who seemed
to be under the Influence of liquor. 'They
entered the hack - and 'â¢ Galvin instructed
Miller to drive to the Elysium. There the
two. women went upstairs, and Galvin fol
lowed them. In about ten minutes Galvin
and the Clark woman came hurriedly
down stairs Â¦ and got into the : hack, and
ordered Miller to drive them to Market
and Fifth streets. They, all had a drink
In a saloon there, and Miller then drove
Galvin and the woman to the saloon at 30
Fourth street, where he left them.
Mrs. Tillle Holly, who has charge of the
Fulton House, identified Anita Clark as
the woman who called there: late Satur
day night with an elderly woman and en
gaged a room.. She could not 'Identify
Galvin, as . he was ' in the dark hallway
when she saw him, but says that her as
sistant, who is sick, will be able to iden
tify him.
The detectives think it' was the purpose
of . the Clark woman to rob * Mrs. Foote
in the -Fulton House, but she had not the
nerve, and Galvin then went back to the
saloon and got something . which would
make Mrs. Foote unconscious, so they
could jointly rob her at the Elysium.
Galvin positively refused-to talk except
to deny that he " ever. -was in' Miller's
hack. The Clark woman also declined to
make any statement. .: \ -

ARCHBISHOP REMINDS HEARERS
THAT THIS LIFE IS AS A VAPOR
- A large congregation was present last
evening at St. Mary's Cathedral on Van
Ness avenue when . solemn high vespers
were celebrated in anticipation or the
coming of the new year. Archbishop
Riordan delivered a stirring sermon and
administered the benediction and the im
pressive service was conducted -by Vicar
General Prendergast, assisted by a full
choir.
Â¦' The beautiful white altar of the cathe
dral was - ablaze . with dozens of lighted
candles and the ' solemnity of the occa
sion pervaded the interior of the sacred
edifice. The robes of the priests and the
acolytes lent vivid color to the scene
and all present were deeply imbued with
the realization of .the passing of the rlrst
year of the twentieth century and the
dawning of the second year of the mo
mentous period.
Archbishop Riordan selected for the text
of his sermon a verse from the Apostle
St. ; James, comparing life to a vapor,
which appears for a little time and then
vanishes. In part the Archbishop said:
The last night of the present year is a land
mark which speaks of the flight of time.
Though one day may seem, as another, we are
not so conscious of the fact 'as when we stand
within a few hours of the close of the year.
These last moments of luol must be of seri
ous reflection. To-morrow Is a day of good
wishes and resolutions. To-night our thoughts
are In a minor key. We look over the * past
and we are obliged to give ourselves thoughts
respecting our future lives. We must ask our
selves If we are better men and women than
we were one year ago. Have we applied'our
selves assiduously to time and its opportuni
ties? We sit to-night by the roadside and re
flect on the Journey of the last twelve months.
Like the careful man of business the Christian
people should take stock at ths end of the
year. They should take stock of their position
and see If they are nearer to God at the end
of this year than they were a year ago. Reso
lutions should be formed accordingly. ~
Life Is as a Vapor.
Let us pause and think what is Ufa after
all. St.: James says that it is as a vapor that
rises for the moment, then vanishes and - It
gone. The - holy scriptures deal chiefly with
the uncertainty of life. Life is like the ripples
caused by casting a stone Into the waters. In
a little while the -ripples pass away and all la
quiet again. Â£tefij
' Let us gee how we havÂ» lived in ths last
year and what resolutions we - shall take ' for
the new year, if God grant that we shall live.
What Is done ' cannot be undone, no matter
how: much we may wish it. Every deed of
man or woman lives forever beforeOod. We
cannot control the past actions of our ; lives.
They are stamped like photographs on ' the
plates of eternity and will confront us somÂ«
day. We ' are unmindful from day to . day of
our thoughts and deeds. We think that cer
tain thlnffs we have said and done are for
gotten, but we are in error. We . may our
selves forget them, others may forget them,
but the acts and deeds live forever. . How We
Â¦would like to pluck some of the paees" from
the record of the passing year and consign
them to _the flames. But "Â¦ It is Impossible.
Therefore at . this ; time, we must oonder on
what life Is. Some say that the present life
Is all that we have and that the future Is
a matter of faith and mysticism. How dif
ferent are the teachings of the master.
. We know that we are living for an Important
purpose. The years on. this earth are but
years of preparation. Toward the end of life
It Increases in value." . It increases Â¦ In value

the judgment of the lower Â» court which

by the corporation that Lee had been care
less, but the court held that the motorman
might - have prevented the . accident, so
even though it were admitted that the in
jured man had been guilty of contributory
negligence he could still collect damages.
The case" of 'Dr. -Charles VClark and Q.
Only Made an Autopsy.
Matsumara, steward in the' Nippon Mara
Hospital, 1 charged with ' mutilating the
dead* body, of Iwakisha Imamura, a Jap
anese, . was dismissed by ' Judge Mogan
yesterday... It, was shown that Dr. Clark
had been attending 1 the Japanese for pleu
risy,- from -which ; he . died,"' and as usual
an autopsy was made on the body.'
" Â¦ It is â¢ also entirely* false and ' absolutely ab
surd that Mealey, as stated in American news
papers, was given the alternative of renounc
ing, his rights to the disputed mining property
or being placed and kept in Jail. - '
I beg to assure you that all the criminal pro
ceedings instituted and carried out against
Mealey are perfectly and strictly In accordance
with .the laws of the republic of Mexico now
in force. - Â¦BMMMSttiWMMSgjnBHHnS
Â¦ The criminal proceedings ' instituted against
Mealey have nothing to do with the civil suits
that Mealey has brought against t the mining
company, Norias de' Bajan. These law /suits
were decided before the courts of the State of
Coahuila.. have been appealed* and are now
pending before the Supreme Court of Justice of
the republic.' â¢ , Â¦ .
.*-. "When . Mealey was arrested 'he was assigned
to the best quarters in the public Jail. and was
Installed Â¦ in the, rooms of ' the warden of the
prison. - He was entirely apart from the other
prisoners and was shown all consideration dur
ing -his detention.. He was given his liberty
under bonds under due process of law. These
facts are personally known to the United States
Consul In this city. .- ; ' Â¦ . â¢ Â¦Â¦_:.-.
Says Mealey Was "Well Treated.
-You may be assured that all that Is stated
in the correspondence published. in the Ameri
can newspapers is false. and absolutely/devoid
of foundation. - The American citizen, .W. H.
Mealey, was arrested by order of the Federal
District Court of . the State of Coahuila,
charged with disobeying: the orders of the court,
and principally for having taken and retained
unlawfully in his possession part of , the records
of the mining agency of Monclova and for hav
ing committed perjury before the said District
Court and. before the Secretary of the . Interior.
. Consul General -Coney ., yesterday re
ceived, a communication from Santiago A.
Suarez, Judge of the Federal District of
Coahuila, who committed | Mealey to pris
on. In writing of the accounts published
in America of the alleged ill-treatment of
Mealey, based on reports and letters writ
ten by the detained man and his friends,
Judge Suarez writes in part:
So much publicity was given to the af
fair that President . Roosevelt instructed
Secretary of State Â¦ Hay to investigate.
The Secretary of State in turn requested
Minister â¢ Clayton to make an investi
gation of the arrest of Mealey and. the
alleged ill-treatment he had received while
in prison.' ''The " report of. the Minister
has not yet been received at Washington,
Â¦but is expected daily. -.'. <
When the newspapers in this city pub
lished the telegraphic dispatches of the
alleged ill-treatment of Mealey in a Mex
ican prison Consul General Coney sent the
reports to his Government and asked for
information. Â¦ The matter was referred by
the 'Mexican authorities to the Judge who
committed Mealey to prison and that of
ficial gives a version of the affair entirely
different to, the one supplied by Mealey
, and: his friends.-
Minister's Report Expected Daily.
The woes of Mealey have occupied.con
siderable' space in the public eye in the
last few weeks. According to dispatches
and letters sent from Mexico to the United
States in October and November last Mea
ley was the victim of a conspiracy that
had for its object. the wresting from him
of mining property valued at more tban\
$2,000,000. . . ]
The" newspapers of the United States Â¦Â¦
told how Mealey had - been thrown into
prison and his health had been Imperiled
on account of the vile dungeon in which
he had been incarcerated. Mealey'a friends
openly asserted that prominent officials
in Â¦ Mexico had cast longing eyes oh the
famous Norias de Bajan mine in. the State
of.Coahuila, to which Mealey had a title,
and that, he was deprived of his liberty in
order to force him to relinquish his claims
to ; the : valuable Ian ds. .
Mexican Consul General Coney, sta
tioned in; this. city, yesterday received in
formation from his country that places
an entirely different light on the alleged
iil-rtreatment accorded in Mexico to-W. H.
Mealey, an American residing in the sis
ter . republic. ,Â¦
