Squares.
TRIESTE, Austria, Feb. 14.â This city
Is practically in the hands of riotous
etrikers. All the factories are closed and
the few stores which opened for business
vere compelled to close, owing to the
snobs which paraded the streets. Traffic
en the street railroads was suspended.
The headquarters of the Austrian
Uoyds Steamship Company, whose fire
men were the first to strike, were pro
tected by -a strong force of police,' who
repeatedly charged and attempted to
drive back the rioters. The military have
occupied the public squares ' and other
points of. vantage. The mobs frequently
stoned the police and some shots were
fired.
A meeting held this afternoon in the
Piazza Grande was followed by a street
fight, during- which the troops fired a vol
ley into the mob, six of whom were killed
and twenty severely wounded.
The meeting was attended by 4900 strik
ers. It was addressed by the labor lead
ers, -who spoke In a pacific vein, but owing
to the singing and hooting they could not
obtain a hearing.
After numerous scrimmages the con
stantly growing mobs of rioters attacked
â a company of troopers in the rear with
volleys of stones. A licuteriant was se- '
verely wounded and fell. His men then
opened fire, killing six. The further dis
persal of the rioters was accomplished
by the police with drawn swords, and
many men were wounded.
The labor leaders have consented that a
court of arbitration settle the dispute of
the strikers. Altogether 2p t 000 men of all.
traces have gone on strike. The tram
ways, the railroads and the newspapers
are all affected. The city is auiet to
night. All the buildings are protected by

_ "Before the bombardment of Manila
Admiral Dewey notified the foreign com
manders that he proposed to attack, and
he requested that they get out of the
way. ' The German and French anchored
on one side of the bay and the English
and Japanese took a position just in tha
American rear. In view of these cir
cumstances, is it strange that the senti
ments of the fleet at Manila were not
friendly to the Germans?
"It is true that the Germans offered to
surrender these persons to the Americans,
but Admiral Dewey had no place tor put
them and permitted them to be landed.
Just before the fall of Manila, a German
man-of-war conveyed the Spanish Cap

. VThe Germans were constantly showing
their sympathy for i the Spaniards. When
ever their ships came In the harbor they
would ostentatiously salute the Spanish
flag. German ships brought to Manila the
families of Spanish officers who were sur
rounded by^ insurgents on Isla Grande.
"When Vice Admiral von Diedrichs sent
his flag lieutenant on board the Olympla
to complain at the interference of the
American ships. Admiral Dewey told him,
to tell his chief that if he wanted war he
was prepared to let him have it. This
declaration had a good effect.
That Message of Defiance.
"The German ships at Manila were con
tinuously running in and out of the har
bor, passing through the American block

the harbor at night, necessitating con

men-of-war, who might have fired on
them, mistaking them for Spanish tor
pedo boats.

of his squadron, which were with Prince
Henry at Kiachou, to come to Manila Bay
to reinforce him.

Dewey and the Prince.
"Just before the war with Spain Prince
Henry and Admiral Dewey engaged in a
conversation in the course of which the
Prince stated that the powers would not
permit the United States to acquire Cuba.
"So far as Prince Henry is concerned
his relations with Admiral Dewey in the
Far East were quite pleasant. The only
unpleasantness that occurred was at a
banquet at Hongkong. ; Prince Henry did"
not refuse to toast the United States, as

success- in every detail. - Many
friends of the club thronged the
room and added to the proceeds of the

less energy to give practical assistance
wherever it is possible regardless of creed
or social position. The bright spirit of
helpfulness of the earnest workers wins
admiration and the large attendance yes
terday was a fair, testimonial. The dec
orations were carried out in white, red
and gold. The International Sunshino
Society colors are white and gold, while
red belongs to the Alden. Foliage was
carefully blended with the decorations*
Over a table was a large canopy formed
by four \ strings of red hearts. : In the
drawing room was the Sunshine shield,
bearing the I. S. S. monogram, outlined
in gold and surrounded by red hearts.
The members of the Alden Club wore red
badges with gold letters. ... Three palmists
were present and added much' to the en

STORM WORKING SOUTHWARD.
As Santos-Dumont landed the great as
semblage which had gathered on the
.shore acclaimed him with extreme en
thusiaFm. His first words of a hurried
interview, obtained as he made his way
toward his residence, were: "I am not
discouraged. My trip to Cape Martin is
only postponed. I will start again as
Boon as I can get ready. This accident
was due to the entanglement of the guide
rope with the screw and wires of the
balloon. The balloon was not fully In
flated when I started. Seeing that an
accident was: inevitable I pulled the
emergency cord, but nulled it harder than
I intended. Thifi made a bigger rent than
,1 wanted. OonÂ»p<iu<Â»ntly the airship col
lapsed too quickly."
The launch went alongside the half-
Cefiated balloon of the airship, which
.threatened at any moment to smother
Santos-Dumont. The latter was half
pulled and half clambered over the gun
wale of the boat. The Prince of Monaco
took him by the hand and urged him to
allow himself to be taken on board the
yacht to dry himself and change his
clothes. But the aeronaut refused to flo
this until the remnant of his airship had
"been saved. With the sea water dripping
from his clothes and looking like a water
rat the inventor stood in the bow of the
launch shouting directions for the salvage
of his airship. It was impossible to save
more than the silk envelope. The motor
had to be left to Its fate and It sank.
The launch with, the inventor then made
ior.the shore.
The balloon, which was then almost in
the sea, rose slowly for a few moments.
But the motor stopped again and the air
ship descended a second time until San
tos-Dumont was Immersed up to his-arm
pits in the water/ The aeronaut, with
the pluck which had characterized him
throughout his dangerous experiments,
could be seen standing up in his car ges
ticulating and shouting directions to
those on the launch, which was towing
him toward the Princess Alice. At 2:55
o'clock the end of the balloon burst and
the Prince of Monaco, who was on board
the launch, then gave orders to rescue
Santos-Dumont from his perilous posi
tion.
In turning the balloon the guide rope
caught in the screw and this, with the
erratic working of the airship, created a
situation of great danger. At the same
Time a squall burst from Tete de Chien
and Santos-Dumont tilted the head of his
balloon upward in order to disengage the
guide rope. But in doing so, the ballast
shifted and the oil used to run the motor
began to spread. Fearing an explosion,
the inventor pulled the emergency cord.
This ripped the envelope of tfte balloon,
Â¦which at once began rapidiy to descend.
In the meanwhile the steam launches in
the bay were making toward the spot
where it was supposed the balloon would
fall. The first to approach was the Prin
cess Alice, belonging to the Prince of
Monaco, and those on board seized the
balloon's guide rope, which somehow had
"become disentangled. At the moment this
was done a sharp cracking sound, made
by the motor, could be heard and the
screw was seen to revolve.
It was soon noticed, however, that in
stead of maintaining its usual equilibrium
the balloon rose and pitched â¢ in a way
that caused considerable anxiety among
the spectators. The aeronaut, however,
kept on his flight, and, pointing his ship
to the left, continued to ascend until the
long guide rope was quite twenty feet out
of the water.
A big crowd assembled at the entrance
of the aerodrome, and, as the large doors
of the building rolled back, the airship
emerged at twenty minutes of 3. A num
ber of steam yachts and launches. In
cluding the Prince of Monaco's yacht.
Princess Alice, with several parties on
board, were cruising about the bay with
the intention of following the balloon.
Cheers greeted Santos-Dumont as his air-
Ehlp rose and its head pointed for the
middle of the bay.
MONACO, Feb. 14. â Santos-Dumont, the
aeronaut, met with a disaster here to
Â£&y and had a narrow escape from death.
His airship is a total wreck, while.to
rAgbt his motor lies at the bottom of the
bay of Monaco.
The ' morning broke gloriously, Â¦ but as
there was considerable wind. Santos-Du
xnoct decided not to attempt flight. To
ward 2 o'clock in the afternoon, however,
the wind dropped and tho weather ap
peared to be perfect. Santos-Dumont an
nounced that he would make a trip.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
| EUREKA, Feb. 14.â The rainstorm that
has raged in this county for the past two
weeks will prove, it is believed, one of
the most damaging that has occurred
here in many years. Rivers have overÂ«
flowed their banks and in many instances
encroached on the homesteads of farm
ers. John Gasner was compelled to move
out of his house near Ferndale because
of the flood. The floor of the Eel Rlvtr
Creamery building was covered with
water to the depth of 17 Inches and some
of the outer structures were swept away.
Ten bridges are reported to have been
swept away between Hydesvilie and
Blocksburg, and the ferries have not been
running for ten days, cutting off the peo
ple in the southern end of the county
from all connection with the towns.
The entrance to Eel River is now
straight out to sea, having changed about
half a mile to the north. As the rivers
recede they are cutting deeply into the
rich dairy lands along the banks. Eel
River is reported to be carrying the fer
tile lands along Its north bank out to
sea. It is feared that if the storm con
tinues the Eel will cut through into Salt
River and destroy a large area of the
finest dairy land in the State. 'Ten acres
of land on the extreme end of Cock Robin
Island, belonging to the Andreaeon place
has been carried away. More than 12
Inches of rain has fallen.
Special Dispatch, to The Call.
The Honolulu papers all comment at
great length on the news from "Washing
ton.. The Star advises Governor Dole to
go to Washington himself and see the
President, and both the Star and Adver
tiser claim that the cause of any possible
intention on the part of Roosevelt to re
tire Dole is a long campaign of unfounded
charges and irresponsible misrepresenta
tions at Washington. The Star says of
Dole that he "has risked his fortune, his
liberty, aye, his life itself, to establish
this country upon a true American basis.
His reward, after he has succeeded, has
been to be hounded, traduced and ma
ligned."
The Bulletin . says that Parker is a
peace candidate, and claims to have a
dispatch stating that his appointment was
to be sent to the Senate on February 6.
It says that the appointment , of Parker
means an "end to the oligarchy which
President Dole took along with him /when
he became Governor." The paper adds
that, harmony under Dole is impossible.
"The appointment of Parker ought to put
an end to the home rule movement," says
the Bulletin. , : .
*: The Advertiser says that the report
from Washington is the climax of a cam
paign which has been , "a systematic and
constant stream of insinuations, misrep
resentations and false charges against
Governor Dole bruited in "Washington and
dinned into the. ears of the President,
Cabinet, Senators. Representatives and
subordinate officials. If the derogatory
statements that have been made to the
President are true, the sooner Governor
Dole Is removed the better. , But every
one here knows that they â¢ are not true
that: Governor Dole is an upright, Chris
tian gentleman, the soul of honor, : of
spotless integrity. ; affable to a rare*de
gree; the one. man who could have suc
cessfully piloted Hawaii through the
stormy period from 1893 to 1898, and who
made 1 'Americanism , possible . here."
Honolulu Press Comment.
George Carter seems to be very nerv
ous at the situation in which he is placed.
His father was of the old missionary
families and the son has trained with
them. He has always been a Dole man
and an annexationist, but now seems pre
pared to speak against Dole and suggest
Baldwin for. Governor, who is acceptable
to .-e business interests. It is said if
Governor Dole had not been so consid
erate of all the native Hawailans in re
taining them in me public offices, but
had turned them out and given their jobs
to Republicans, mere never would have
been a murmur against him or his admin
istration. No matter who succeeds him,
should any change be made, he will be
the butt of the "outs" within a Â¦ few
months, Just as Dole has been.
It is a fact not knowri here that Rear
Admiral Robley D. Evans made a report
to the President after his recent stay of
ten days in Honolulu. This report was
not- favorable, to the Governor, but
"Fighting Bob" is not Known to have con
sulted any people with large interests at
stake in the Territory, but rather to have
gathered his information from the loung
ers in the. hotel lobbies.. . v
â¢''Admiral Evans Investigated.
An Old Political Battle.
It Is one of the old political battles, for
which Honolulu has been, famous for
more than a couple of decades. It is as
serted that the only cause for complaint*
against the Governor is his refusal to
call a special session of the Legislature
to authorize a bond issue. Experience
with the Legislature in its former, ses
sion did not show any tendency on the
part of the natives, who are in control,
to do more than waste time and money.
Taxation, moreover, is frightfully high
and nobody would appreciate an increase
In this direction. Outside of this one
reason, there is nothing of an official or
personal nature - that can be charged
against the Governor, say his supporters,
and the "outs" form a mugwump section
of the Republican party, who have be
come sore simply because they are the
"outs."
Already there is a tendency to talk of
a compromise candidate, and J. B. Ather
ton, a friend of- Dole and a man who is
largely interested in the sugar business,
has led the way and expressed his will
ingness to support any man for Governor
who will be acceptable to both factions
of the Republican party in order to re
store harmony in its ranks. â¢
Carter, it is understood, will go to
Washington prepared with such a name â
that of H. P. .Baldwin, manager. of a large
plantation and one of the wealthy men
of the Territory.. Parker will be recom
mended for Secretary, and not Governor,
while the office of Treasurer is slated for
W. R. Farrington, editor of the Bulletin,
who has been the vigorous opponent of.
the Government's faction. - " .
Governor Dole told The Call correspon
dent this morning that he had not re
ceived any request for his resignation,
I nor had any desire for it been hinted at,
! as the dispatches stated. The Governor
said he only wished that President Roose
velt .would send Secretary Hitchcock, or
some other gentleman In whom he has
equal confidence, to Honolulu to make a
' thorough investigation of political condi
tions, and' he is perfectly willing to abide
by the result. This is the way that all
the Governor's friends feel.
HONOLULU, Feb. 7.â George R. Car
ter,'aon..of a former Hawaiian Minister to
"Washington, has been asked by President
Kocsevelt for his views upon the political
situation in Hawaii, and Carter leaves
for "Washington on Tuesday, February 11,
by the Oceanic Company's steamer Sono
ma. ' He should arrive in San Francisco
on -Monday, February 17.
Previous!} Carter had received a tele
gram from Samuel Parker asking him to
meet the latter in San. Francisco "at the
.President's request." Not understanding
the purport of the message, Carter re
mained at homel Now, however, he feels
it his duty to report in person to Mr.
Roosevelt, and during the few days he is
here he will be gathering the views of
both the opponents and friends of Gov
ernor Dele, so as to be in a position to
place them before the President..
Parker's avowal in Chicago that he is
to succeed Dole as Governor of Hawaii
has aroused the whole community, and
the hot-pot of politics is fairly seething
over. The "ins" are gloomy and the
"outs" feel expectant.

SECRETOUT.
The Great Trainer Put
His Faith in Nerves.
ENDURANCE HE WANTED!
The ablest manager of professional ath-
letes In the world. Thomas O'Rourke of
New York City, writing to the proprie-
tors of Paine' a Celery Compound on Jan-
uary 11, said:
"One of the most important features in
the training of an athlete is to invigorate
his nervous system, and nothing: ever
takes the place of Palne's Celery Com-
pound to accomplish this! It facilitates
getting a man In prime condition. In my
experience in handling athletes I have
never found anything equal to it."
This from a man of whom the most
wonderful champion In the world said,
when one of Mr. O'Rourke's pupils had
won the -world's championship: "The se-
cret of O'Rourke's success I cannot un-
derstand. "Wonderful endurance and an
inexhaustible supply of nerve force dis-
tinguishes the men he coaches from their
opponents in every battle."
For the past eleven years Mr. O'Rourke
has been recognized as the greatest
trainer In the world. "While he was
coaching George Dixon, that young ath-

lete was the world's champion. Sharkey,
who was at first a rough and tumble
giant, under O'Rourke's training devel-
oped Into an even-tempered, hardy, strong,
rugged boxer.
The above unsolicited words from Mr.
O'Rourke, who, by the way, has been the
owner of the Broadway Athletic Club,
the Lenox Club, the Coney Island Club
and Royals Golf Club, and who is known
to ba one of the finest gentlemen among
the devotees of the manly art. tell the
whole story. He found In Palne's Celery
Compound nature's food for the nerves.
"While this remedy has affected . thou-
sands of cures among those who are sick,
and has restored to healthy life innum-
erable men and women whose nervous
systems have been shattered, and who
were suffering from the symptoms of the
beginning of a deep-rooted impairment of
the nervous systemâ it is worth noting
that even in those exhausting contests
where absolutely perfect nerves are pre-
eminently needed, this remedy has also
been found equally as beneficial in re-
pairing the exhaustion due to the high
training.
If such men, who require above every-
thing else â above muscles (which cannot
develop without good nerves) ; above cour-
age, which no man with weak nerves
ever hadâ who require above everything
else perfect nervesâ If such men have
found it necessary to feed the nerves and
brain with the food nature requiresâ it is
good proof that this greatest of all reme-
dies, the discovery of one of America's
ablest professors, accomplishes all that is
claimed for It.
Every man or woman whose nervous
system is not in perfect condition will
find that this remeay will make it so!
No other remedy In the world was ever
so universally acknowledged by physi-
cians, and all those who have manly and
womanly development in hand to be so
perfectly adapted to cases of falling
health and lagging vitality.

It Is a long: document and one of Its
features is the clear and concise presenta
tibn of the facts regarding the Santiago
fight as given the President by the cap
tains engaged in that battle, who recently,
were summoned to the White House to
confer with him. The decision Is couched
In the President's characteristic vigorous
tone.
The President has given a good deal of
attention to the matter, and it Is under
stood that in the course of a few days,
probably by the middle of next week, he
will be ready to announce his conclusions.
Members of the Cabinet are extremely
reticent as to what the President's views
are, beyond the statement that his deci
sion undoubtedly will clear the atmos
phere somewhat upon many of the in
volved questions. t
The President outlined his views on the
Schley case by reading the first draft of
his decision. Some modifications were
made in it, and in view of the fact that it
is subject to further and possibly impor
tant changes in the text, members of the
Cabinet back their indisposition to dis
cuss it by the assertion that It is unsafe
at this time to predict what its exact ef
fect will be.

There was a sequel to Wheeler's speech
later in the day when Grosvenor secured
Amid great confusion and cries of regu
lar order Boutell of Illinois said the
criticism made on the head of one of our
great departments should not go unan
swered. No man in recent -years, he de
clared, to the rattle â¢ of Republican ap
plause, had reflected such credit. on our
diplomatic affairs as the present head of
the State Department.
Boutell closed with a declaration that
he could not sit silent while attacks were
being made upon a man who had shed
luster upon our diplomacy. The excite
ment occasioned by Wheeler's speech then
subsided and the consideration of pension
bills was resumed.
Grosvenorâ On : the contrary, he came
under another name and the attendant
that was with him came Incognito also,
coming as a mere private citizen, and was
taken charge of by the Government dur
ing his entire stay In the United States
and dined at the White House by a Dem
ocratic President, at the time when Dem^
ocracy meant something. ; -
Wheelerâ If the gentleman Is correct
then I condemn in unmeasured terms the
attitude of that Democratic administra.
tion.
Wheelerâ That is a very different thing.
(Laughter and derisive cries on the Re
publican side.) We received him not as
we are receiving ' this man, if I recollect
rightly, but he came as the offlcialhead
of his Government
Wheeler â Xo, I would have been proud
to join in the commission to welcome the
Marquis Lafayette. He was a great sol
dier, a great fighter and fought for the
rights of the American people. (Applause.)
But this man represents tftat kingism or
flunkyism that seeks to enslave the labor
of every people under the sun. :', Â¦
Glllett of Massachusetts â Does . the gen
tleman criticize the " Democratic adminis Â¦
tratioa of Buchanan in receiving the
Prince of Wales?
Grosvenor of Ohio â If the gentleman
had been Â¦ living at the time Lafayette
came to this country bearing the commis
sion of the King at France would he have
overruled the action of George Washing
ton in sending a commission to meet him
and accompanying him over the country?
Grosvenor Takes a Hand.
"I am only restrained from discussion
of what I regard as the most unfortunate
incident by the ordinary amenities which
should obtain between one gentleman and
another. I allude to the' fact of the oppor
tunity seized by the chief citizen of the re
public to send a member of his family
across the water for the purpose of par
ticipating lu the coronation of a King.
"I shall not discuss that, because it of
necessity Involves matters I do not care to
go Into here. I will, in passing, say that
it is a mofct unfortunate circumstance. . It
Is unprecedented In' our history and Is to
day deeply lamented on the part of every
country-loving man In the republic. I am
sorry he -did it. It Is establishing a pre
cedent that he ought not to recognize, and
it is but one moro link In the chain show
ing toward what end we are drifting.
"One other matter I wish to advert to.
In the next few days we .are to have a
brother of a ruler come over to this coun
try and take charge of a little tug, vessel
or yacht, whatever you please to term It,
built by some people up in New York. We
are appropriating thousands of dollars
and the Anglomanjacs and the European
maniacs are falling over each other to get
to see a little Dutchman' come over and
take charge of a little ship. (Applause on
the Democratic side.) What difference
does It make whether he Is a Prince Hen
ry or not? There are thousands of citi
zens of this republic following the plow
as noble, as honest, as intelligent ad
Prince Henry or Prince anybody : else.
(Applause on the Democratic side.) Why
do the American people give heed to this
foolish and disgraceful flunkyism enacted
by the present administration? What dif
ference does it make to us whether he is
a brother of the Emperor?"
the Booner we are rid of him the better it
will be.
The House then proceeded wllh the con
sideration of pension bills, 125 of which
were passed in thirty-two minutes, which
is the record since the Fifty-first- Con
gress for_ speed. â¢'Â¦ At 3:50 p. m the House
adjourned until Monday. . Â¦
"I protest^ in the name of Democracy
and' Republicanism," said . he "not
against the Reception of this German, if
heJs-not a Dutchman-and it is certainly
not a. badge of dishonor to beaDutchman;
nor is it a badge of dishonor to be a Ger
manâI Protest against the official recep
tion of this German.', I object to the re
public of^the United States undertaking
to play the. flunky, at the feet of a little
German Prince, and I object to the
s Unlted States sending emissaries : abroad
to whistle their fingers and dance at
tendance-at the antechamber of some
Britisher because he is going to "wear the
trown. ' .
- Grosvenor described at some length the
visit of the Prfnce of Wales, In 1860 his
tour^of , the country, the honors showered
upon him by "President Buchanan, who.
he said, rushed out of the White House
and met him with extended arms, as if
he had. been "the/ traditional â¢ prodigal
son, and the state dinner accorded" him
The Prince _was but a boy, he said, 'and
the honor done â¢ him was honor only to
the royal blood in his veins. Â¦ As to the
vlslt^oi: Prince Henry, he was a brother
of he .German Emperor. He was not
a Dutchman, but a Teuton, a German
He was an admiral of the German nayv
the same who had been sent to Manila
to protect German interests, and when
one of his, ships got in the way. Dewey
had informed hjm that If the ship did not
get put of the way in short order there
would be trouble.
"Then he took it away like a - gentle
man, . remarked Grosvenof , amid laugh
' Whe^er secured five, minutes in which
to answer Grosvenor. .
Grosvenor then took up Wheeler's
speech, reading from it 'the term "Little
Dutchman," which Wheeler had' applied
to Prince Henry, and his remarks about
his indifference to the good -will of the
German people. Grosvenor commented
upon this language, saying that while the
gentleman might be indifferent now as to
the goodwill of the Germans, it would
be. different "late: in the fall when per
simmons were ripe." . ; .
The Prince Is a German.
"So far as the young lady Is con
cerned," he added, "I can tell the gentle
man one thing. One thing she would give
him a great deal of trouble If she would
get into a debate with him as to the pro
priety of her going." (Applause and
laughter.) - . .
"Oh, If it is simply a matter of a young
girl going to the coronation of a gentle
man and a lady," observed Grosvenor, "I
will not pursue It."
Just at the' time, when the American
people were to be put to the test as to
whether they were gentlemen it was most
unfortunate that this protest should come
against. the reception of Prince Henry.
,The speech of the gentleman from Ken
tucky, would be exploited In Europe to
morrow, on the eve of the Prince s de
parture, as the message of the American
people to their guest.
Wheeler Interposed at this point to say
that he should gladly welcome any gen
tleman from abroad; what he objected to
was the official color to be given to the
visit. Then, as Grosvenor. proceeded to
read what he had feaid criticizing the
President for making a new precedent In
connection with the coronation of King
Edward, Wheeler interrupted to say that
while he had not desired to bring the mat
ter Into the discussion, what he had de
plored was Â¦ the report that the President
intended to send a member of his family
to the coronation. ~ -
the floor and replied .at length to what
the Kentucklan had eaid. As to Wheeler's
denial of his statement regarding the>
visit of the Prince of Wales in 1860, Gros
venor declared that be personally could
bear witness to the truth of his assertion,
for he himself had seen the Prince when
he first Bet foot on American soil at Ni
agara. As a young man he had listened
to the Prince's speech, he said, with great
interest.
Continued From. fP ago One.
\ At 3 o'clook,' under special order," the
Senate began consideration of private
pension bills. In fifty-five minutes the
calendar was cleared of pension bills, 127
being passed.
A bill was passed authorizing the Presi
dent to appoint William B. Franklin, for
merly colonel of the Twelfth United
States Infantry, as a colonel, and then
place him on the retired list with that"
rank. V, ;
Another measure was passed granting
right of way through Oklahoma Territory
and Indian Territory to the Enid and
Anadarko Railroad Company.
Penrose' presented resolutions express
ing the sorrow of the Senate at the death
of the late Representative M. A. Brosius.
Eulogies were pronounced by Penrose,
Gallinger, McComas and Spooner, and the
Senate at 5 o'clock adjourned.
WASHINGTON.Feb. 14.â A Uttle flurry
was created in the Senate to-day, over
the employment since the beginning of
the session of a score or more ,of extra
clerks and messengers to committees. The
charges ; of extravagance made induced
the ' reference of the . whole subject of
clerical employment to a committee for
Investigation and report.
The bill creating a permanent census
bureau was under consideration for a
time, but was. not disposed of finally. A
large number of private pension bills
were passed. The bill to provide for a
permanent census office was taken up.
Allison, chairman of the Committee on
Appropriations, made an argument
against the , committee amendment in
creasing the salary of the director of the
census â¢ from $3000 to $7500 per annum.
Quarles : made a vigorous defense of the
amendment. Allison moved to make the
director's salary $6000 Instead of J75C0.
This was rejectedâ 15 to 32.- The commit
tee amendment was adopted.

to do so, but became frightened by the

"No, they are not."
Senator Patterson asked how thÂ© people
had been made peaceful in the first placeâ
whether this result had been accomplished
by first battering- them with the military
and then demonstrating to them by the
acts of the Commission the benefits of
American methods. The reply was that
not only the civil government but the
military forces had sought to impress
the adx-antage of American rule. Peace
had been secured by crushing- out the
guerrilla warfare which had had the effect
of establishing a system of terrorizing
with which the people in reneral did not
sympathize. That, however, the people
generally, at least in some provinces, did
not sympathize with the insurrection, he
would not attempt to say.
Senator Culberson â Is it true that under
the existing law they are not at liberty
to advocate an {dependent or & separate
form of government?"
Speaking of the general condition of the
pacified provinces. Governor Taft said
that In ail these provinces the people are
going about their usual avocations. In
one province not a hostile ehot had been
fired for two years.
Troops Are Still Needed.
For himself, he thought it would be de
sirable to contiue small detachments of
troops at convenient points all over the
islands for the purpose of preventing dis
order and violence and serving as a moral
restraint. In this connection. Senator
Lodge stated that the Secretary of "War
had informed him. that when present or
ders are carried into effect there will be
left in the island 1225 officers and 26,231
enlisted men.
Senator Culberson questioned the wit
ness as to the necessity of keeping as
many as 30,000 American troops in the
islands, and the latter replied that Cap
tain Allen estimated that with all the
provinces pacified, 15,000 American troops
would be sufficient.
"I am bound to add," he went on, "that
the difficulty of selecting judges who are
above reproach makes it certain that the
selection of jurors would lead to nothing
but corruption and injustice. We are try-
Ing to lead up to the jury system, but
the Filipino mind Is such as to render
the average Filipino Incapable of looking
impartially upon a question involving tho
rights of two persons. There was no jury
system under Spanish rule."
Governor Taft said that in the matter
of arrest and imprisonment of Filipinos
who had been in insurrection, but who
had later surrendered, there had been
some unquestioned trenching upon the
functions of the civil authorities by the
military forces.
Senator Culberson asked whether there
is any part of the archipelago the control
of which could be trusted to native troops^
and the witness replied that he did not
think that it would be advisable. "I
Bhould not like to have the responsibility
of recommending such a course," be said.
"The experiment never has been tried,
but in a country so recently in insurrec
tion. I should cay that to put a thousand
rines into the hands of natives would not
be wise."
Cannot See Two Sides.
Governor Taft said that Judge Ide, of
the Commission, had prepared the code
of laws of the islands, and that the labor
had been so severe that it materially
damaged his health. This code included
the treason act. There is no provision for
a jury, as 90 per cent of the people are too
ignorant to sit on a Jury.
Governor Taft said that In June of last
year the Commission had passed an act
organizing a system of judiciary for the
entire archipelago, creating a Supreme
Court and seven Justices and -creating
fourteen districts. On the Supreme Court
bench there are, he said, three natives
and four Americans, and he believed that
any State would be satisfied with such a
bench. Of the courts of first instance
in the district 6lx are presided over by
native Filipinos and the others by Ameri
cans.
Senator Lodge asked as to the means
for maintaining tranquility. The reply
involved a review of the legal system of
the islands at present as under the mili
tary government and also under the
Spanish rule.
â¢WASHINGTOX. Feb. 14.â Governor
Taft of the Philippine Commission to-day
continued his statement before the Senate
Committee on the Philippines concerning
conditions in that archipelago, with the
intention of discussing the degree of tran
quility In the pacified provinces, which,
he said, include all the provinces except
Tabayas, Samar and Batangas.

EL PABO, Texas, Feb. ll^'Count" Ru
dolph, de Lucenay, who eloped -from Cali
fornia with Ruby Luckhardt and married
her here, was arraigned in the District
Court this afternoon on the charge of big
amy. After considerable wrangling on the
part of the attorneys the case went to
trial and at nightfall eleven jurors had
been obtained. . 'â¢'- Â¦:-Â¦
The courtroom was packed and the in
terest manifested was intense. Ruby
Luckhardt and the "Count" were brought
face to face for tbe first time since their
separation, and Frank Luckhardt. Ruby's
brother, created a sensation in the court
room by objecting violently to' the girl re
tiring to the ante-chamber with the
"Count" and his lawyers for consultation.
A few days ago the girl requested to be
permitted to visit the "Count" at the jail.
Her brother, upon learning this, -almost
went Into hysterics and created a scene.
He locked Ruby in her room, and declared
to friends that if the girl saw the "Count"
she would make disclosures that would
ruin her brother.
To-day in the courtroom. Burns and
Cbbb, counsel for the defense, asked per
mission to consult with the girl apart and
that her brother be prevented from intim
idating her. A scene of intensity followed.
Frank Luckhardt stood over the girl and
glared at the lawyers. He -whispered to
her almost constantly, urging her not to
go into the ante-chamber, where the
"Count" had been taken. He brushed be
tween Attorney Cobb and the girl, pushing
the young lawyer back with his hand.
Cobb's face flushed with anger, but he did

CLOVERDALE. Feb. 14.â For the tenth
time ln that number of years Cloverdale,
the "citrus city of the north," is a bee
hive of activity, preparatory to the open
ing of the annual citrus fair. Judging
from ' present indications this year's fair
will surpass any heretofore held" in this
city. Heaps of golden fruit piled here and
there about the immense pavilion are asÂ«
Eurance that the quantity and quality of
fruit to be exhibfted will be -greater and
better than ever before. The association
has made satisfactory arrangements with
the railroad company for the accommo
dation of the crowds. The rates will be
Cheap and the train service convenient.
The board of directors of the fair has
offered a long list of prizes to be com
peted for. As no prize will be awarded
for any design that has heretofore been
exhibited in the hall this year's fair will
present an entire change of features.
One of the exhibits will be /an old
fashioned flourmill, with Its ancient
waterwheel, overgrown with moss, with
oranges and lemons i tucked in here and
there and all daintily fringed with flve
flnger ferns and emllax. The old mill
has nearly outlived its usefulness, but
the wheel still runs, though the grinding
has long since ceased. The water gate
has broken down and the water leaks
through.
Down at the farther ' end of the ' hall
and directly opposite the mill will be the
old Cloverdale flourmill in miniature,
with its overshot waterwheel. This will
be a reproduction of one of tbe marks of
California. - j -
Another unique exhibit will be a "drag
on spring" about six feet in diameter and
occupying the center of the hail. The
water will spout up to a height of three
or four feet above the basin and fall into
three bowls, ,each surmounted, by a
dragon. . .-. :. :
Â¦- One novel Idea will be an airship float-
Ing above the rest of the exhibits and sug
gesting to one the prospective mode of
travel in years to come. â¢ . . .. ;J .
A reproduction of the anchor of the
Walla -Walla will be shown. All of the
best designers -who have exhibited here
tofore are preparing exhibits for this
year, which Is a guarantee of a fine dis
play of art as well as of good fruit.

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 14.â All doubt as
to the Intentions of the Rock Island re
garding a future invasion of Southern Pa
cific territory on the ' Pacific Coast are
set at rest by a telegram, that was re
ceived here this morning from the gen
eral offices in Chicago. This .telegram
Instructs the local office * to prepare for
a dally service, to be established on March
1, between Chicago and Los Angeles, via
the new Rock. Island line to El Paso and
thÂ« Southern Pacific to Los Angeles.
When the extension, from Liberal. Kan.,
was completed tolEl Paso there was talk
of the ultimate extension of the line to
the coast over one of the numerous, sur
veys made across New , Mexico and Ari
zona. It was then announced that the
Rock Island would not extend its sphere
of operations farther west than El Paso,
and that an agreement had been reached
whereby the Southern : Pacific and the
Rock' Island would not interfere in one
another's plans. If such â¢â an agreement
was made it was a very one-sided one,
as the announcement made by the Rock
Island indicates. - A ._:Â¦->-;Â¦> ,v
Heretofore passengers for Chicago' from
Los Angeles were compelled to go via the
Santa Fe or Southern Pacific, and, if an
other route were desired, a change of cars
was necessary some- terminal In the
Middle West. .Under the new order pas
sengers may enter the Rock Island cars
in this city, from and after March 3, and.
without change, reach. Chicago in 'less
than three days, as :the Rock Island is
nearly 230 miles shorter than any other
road. ?-.: Â¦â¢':' ;!'.-: Â¦ . . â¢ â¢ Â¦
The, telegram was a complete surprise,
in view of the supposed agreement, and
indicates that .the Vanderbilts are ' deter
mined to build up a business on the coast
that will sooner or later justify the ex
tension of theUrack to the-Paciffc. despite
all-agreements and arrangements to the
contrary. â¢*-Â¦Â¦..* -

been received. : r c
The steamship Pomona arrived yester
day from Eureka. She was six hours

to the stiff head winds that prevailed
throughout . the trip. When the Pomona
left Kureka news had been received ' of
the breaking, up at Point Gorda of the
wrecked schooner Occidental.
Point Gorda, where the Occidental met
her fate, is about ten miles south of Cape
Mendoclno, and has been the graveyard of
many vessels. The waters In the neigh
borhood are dotted with hidden rocks. A
treacherous current sets in toward the
rocks and has carried many a vessel to
destruction.
Among the vessels wrecked there were

ney, who announces that if the vivisection be under
taken he will arrest every man concerned in it, and if
the doctor should die he will- try to get the operators
convicted of manslaughter. Thus we have a nice is
sue between law and surgery, and we shall see
â¢whether any of the would-be vivisectionists are will
ing to make martyrs of themselves in the interest of
science. - . . .
It is to be hoped the hill will be. adopted and the
efficacy of the plan demonstrated' by an American
t-'cmylc. The measure has many ebori. features^ â¢ n
According to the report^ that come to us the. New
York bill is designed mainly to prevent the disfigure
ment pf the country by offensive advertising such as
has now become so prevalent throughout the United
States. It does not undertake to forbid such adver
tising altogether, but seeks^to make it less flaring and
obtrusive by imposing upon it a tax at' the rate "of
one cent for each two square feet of surface occupied.
It is provided that one-third of the revenue is to go
to the State and two-thirds to the county where the
advertising is displayed. .
. The Call has repeatedly directed attention to the
success of the taxation method of regulating the evil
and eliminating many of its" worst features. It has
been tested . on an extensive scale and for a long
period of time in France, and has been found to work
well in every particular. Should the New Yorkers,
therefore, adopt the proposed measure they would be
entering upon no untried experiment, but upon a
policy whose expediency has been demonstrated by
practice. According to recent reports the French
Government not only keeps the streets of its cities
and the landscape of its rural districts free from the
more hideous of advertising posters and lettering,
but it raises at the same time" an annual revenue of
3,000,000 francs from the advertising of the kind,
which it permits. . ,:j^; .-:: v v '-'I
SAN FRANCISCO, is not the only city where
high fences and billboards constitute at once a
nuisance and a menace to the community, nor
is it the only city where a difficulty has been found
in suppressing the evil. New. York is nearly as badly
off as ourselves in that respect, and. is now looking
for relief to the State Legislature, where a bill has
been introduced which undertakes to provide a "rem
edy by subjecting out-of-door advertising to taxa
tion.
REGULATING A NUISANCE.
A Massachusetts tramp .declared in . court that he
would rather go to jail for three months than to saw
wood for two hours, but probably the winter climate
had something to do with the decision. Sawing wood
is warming while it lasts, but it cannot keep a man
out of the blizzards fiom now until spring, and that
is what three months in >jail will do.
It' is not likely, however, that any germ has come,
down to this Congress from the old days when sick
and. wounded! soldiers lay in the basement .; of, the
Capitol. V There has been too -much whitewash used
about that building every year and at nearly all sea
sons of the year for any bacteria to have lived and
propagated through air the long period : that has in
tervened : since that bygone time. ; It is more likely
that the germs came from Washington itself; that
the door of the Capitol was left open, one night and
they blew in; or else that they were taken there by
Congressmen themselves, ' or sent' up in petitions, or
generated .by spontaneous creation. As for the lock
jaw germ, it may -have attained its admission by a
special .providence. What could â¢ be better for* the
country than a ! prevalence of lockjaw among the
members of both, houses for the next. six months?
One speculator on the subject says the germs are
a survival of the Civil War, when the basement of the
Capitpl was for a time used as an emergency hospi
tal. A patriotic, people will not accept that theory.
The war has long been over, and all of its germs are
gone. Moreover, 1 a t soldier germ would not in
juriously affect Congress. It might prove beneficial
to almost any man in either House to get a good war
veteran germ in his blood., If it injured his health
it would at least give him a claim for a. Civil War
pension', and it. would be cheaper for the. Government
to pay him that than to pay him a salary as Congress
man. - -*.-'. â¢ *
Here's a pretty howdy edo. Why should the Rep
resentatives produce twenty-three germs for every
seven produced by the Senators? Is it a mere ques
tion of the numerical .superiority of the membership
of the lower house, or is : there some deeper law' in
operation?
A WASHINGTON dispatch says: "More kinds
of disease germs have been found in the Capi
tol by Architect Woods than' exist in the
average bacteriological laboratory. He has secured
the bacteria of lockjaw, tuberculosis, typhoid, in
fluenza and many other diseases. The House has
produced twenty-three germs of various kinds to
seven found in the Senate Chamber.",
CONGRESSIONAL GERMS.
The jeymaturity of it is apparent. Reciprocity is
between independent Governments. The junta is de
manding free trade and promising reciprocity, but it
represents no government capable of making a tariff
or doing any other thing which governments may
do. Wait till Cuba has a government. Wait till we
see whether losing the sale of oiye-fortieth of her
sugar to Spain puts her in rags and tatters. Wait
till the American farmer is heard from on the subject
of a protection policy, of which he bears all the bur
dens and from which he gets none of the profits.
Meantime let experience deal with the woeful future
predicted for Cuba.
At present the free trade proposition is based upon
the expectation that Cuba will reciprocate by abating
her tariff on American manufactures. Why press
such a policy while Cuba has no government, â¢ no
authority to promise anything nor to redeem any
thing?' t^r''- : 'i\
We know with much accuracy that free trade for
Cuban sugar means the destruction of our domestic
sugar industry. We know that it came into being
by protection. We know that it was the first signi
ficant extension of protection to agriculture, and we
know that the farmers of many States have profited'
by it, and that it means the addition of a new crop to
the variety by which they make a living from their
land. Extension of protection to them was an
economic experiment that has become a demonstra
tion. Why should it be abandoned, to the injury of
American farmers, in order that Cuba may be deliv
ered from hypothetical distress? Why not consider
the interest of the American farmer and make the
Cuban the subject of experiment? Why not let Cuba
go on, organize her government, take the indepen
dence for which she fought and which we gained for
her, and wait and see whether she goes over the hill
to the poorhouse by losing the chance to sell one
ton of sugar in Spain to forty sold in the United
States?
The statistics give the measure of that market.
Cuba sold in Spain from 189 1 to 1896 an average an
nually of $6,500,000. In the three years 1894-06 Cuba
Bold in Spain only 65,872 tons of sugar. In the same
years she sold in the United States 2,251,819 tons.
Our market is open to her on as good terms as in
1895-96, and if she prospered then, as it is declared
she did, when Spain was taking only one ton of her
sugar to forty tons sold in the United States, it is
somewhat difficult to see why. she is to be pauperized
by having the same market for forty tons to every
one ton she lost by losing the Spanish market
Over and over again the plea is made that by sep
arating Cuba from Spain we . were the means
of destroying Cuba's Spanish market, and she
has none left unless she can break into ours.
Inasmuch as the island was for twenty years
in a chronic state of rebellion against Spain
and her market, engaged in a bloody struggle
to separate from both, there is a far-fetchedness in
the accusation that we were guilty of the divorce.
Cuba made us weep the fountain of pity dry by her
talc of woe. We came to her rescue, and now we
are accused of losing her market for her!
rpHE free trade efforts of the Cuban junta con-
I tinue with unabated zeal, and profess to be en
â¢*Â¦ couraged by signs of weakening on the part of
members of the Committee of Ways and Means.
Cuban Boards of Trade and other commercial bodies
explode frequently with cries of distress, predicting
ruin and starvation for the island unless sugar, to
bacco and fruits get free entry to our market.
ECONOMIC EXPERIMENTS.
Sooner or later, however, there will be a reckoning
between the people and the War Office. Parliament
may postpone the issue and try to avoid disclosures
that would lead to a scandal,, but .the. public, mind is
evidently becoming excited over the revelations that
have been made by the press, * If the facts are not
made known by official investigation At is quite likely
some enterprising newspaper will take up the mat
ter and bring them to light. Too much has been
already made known for the question to be put by
altogether, and when once the coronation is over we
shall doubtless. find public sentiment forcing the Lib
erals to take up the fight or to abandon the field and
let the leadership of the opposition fass tnto the
more vigorous hands of the radicals.
The Liberals are not making as much use of these
disclosures as might be expected, but there is a prob
ability that their lack of vigor is due largely. to a de
sire on the part of the King to have a harmonious
Government and Parliament around him. at the time
of the coronation. 'Almost everything that is done
in Parliament shows the influence of a strong power
tending to peace and quietness. The 1 Liberals have
not only neglected to take the lead in making a sharp
opposition to the Government, but they have declined
to take advantage of the openings, nj^de : by the Irish
Nationalists. In short, .Liberals as: well. ;as Conserva
tives seem to have decided to let/tWs^session of Par
liament glide along as smoothly^as' possible to the
A specimen case is that of thV contract recently
granted for supplying meat to the army. Members of
the opposition in Parliament questioned the Ministry
on the subject, Jju.t the questions" were evaded. -An
investigation was undertaken outside the House, and
the result has been a statement that it can be proven
that the contract was sold three times.'. .The first con
tractor is alleged to have disposed of it for Â£10,000 to
parties who sold it afterward for Â£\o,boo % '-. and those
parties transferred it to Cecil Rhodes and the De
Beers group for a still larger sum. 'It is to be noted
that even, conservative journals that-ndo-not-join in
the cry of fraud admit that the expenditures of the
Government have been wasteful, or, as the Saturday
Review puts it, ''We have been swindled bn -a' very
large scale." ... . . . .
The Liberals have not made as yet any very vig
orous efforts to get exact statements from the. Min
istry,'but they have managed to bring about disclos-'
ures which tend to the conclusion that scarcely any
kind of supplies have been obtained for the army on
strict business principles, and with -due regard for
economy and efficiency. It is- charged that speculat
ing contractors have, obtained contracts from the
Government upon terms' which enabled them to'make
thousands of pounds by ...reselling them, and in some

The anti-laundry people are described in general
terms as "covites," white, but semi-civilized. The
situation they have created is complicated by the peo
ple of Tullahoma, a near-by town, where civilization
has its outward and visible signs in a newspaper and
opera-house, who declare that they will defend the
laundry vi et armis. And there the situation stands,
in statu quo. The university is short one laundry
and two officers, and the cause of higher culture is in
danger. Well may* the collegian cry out for one hour
of the student body of Harvard or Yale, to put, the
Sewaneese under that discipline for which they are
celebrated. One initiation into a Greek letter frater
nity would teach that leisure class enormities of which
it never dreamed, and make its native barbarities_ look
like the sport of babes and sucklings.
They met the obdurate university a trifle more than
half way by notifying its officers that they would kill
them all. A skull and crossbones committee visited
the vice chancellor and steward of the institution with
a foot rule to measure the shortness of their shrift,
and steward and vice chancellor stood not upon the
order of their going but went at once, and are not
any more forever up to this moment in Sewanee. The
other professors are in a sort of siege, and the laun
dry is not going up.
The officers concluded the time had come to be ob
durate, and so they obdurated, publicly and defiantly.
But they had not counted on the persistence of the
leisure class of Sewanee. With them it was a ques
tion of having to go at work to support their wives
instead of being supported by them.
The faculty and trustees of the Southern Univer
sity ruminated over this wash business â chewed the
rag. so to speakâ and decided to wash out the indig
nit3 r in another laundry. When this purpose became
known the leisure class of Sewanee served notice on
the university authorities that not only would the
new laundry be destroyed if built, but if the intention
to build it were not at once abandofted all the build
ings of the university would be blown up or down, as
the case may be, with dynamite. . .
But the Southern University aspired to wash its
Ov.'n linen; and constructed a laundry, with all the
modern improvements, for that purpose. Then
Sewance's leisure class arose with torch in hand and
burned the laundry to the bitter end, and notified. the
university not to build another, but to continue let
ting out its wash to the neighbors.
In its developmental period the washing for- the fac
ulty and students had been done, by the people of the
neighborhood. As it could be done by women it re
leased the bread-winners from responsibility and they
could hunt, fish/talk politics, lynch niggers and
drink red' 'liquor! Sewanee by this means had
achieved a "leisure class," which was highly appre
ciated, by itself.
Another case of neighborhood discipline, has just
occurred in Tennessee. Away, down at Sewanee, in
that State, the philomathic heart is turning ever, be
cause there's where the Southern University stays.
Down South there has arisen a form of university
trouble that is peculiar. The trustees of the Agricul
tural University of Florida found necessary the occu
pation." of. a part of the ground that in its period of
disuse . had accommodated the public as a by-way,
a cut across lots. The people resented the reclama
tion of their own by the trustees, and to emphasize
their resentment fired the house of the president at
night, nearly cremating his family and destroying the
cherished relics and scientific and artistic collections
of a lifetime. The fact that the president was 4 from
the North probably accounted for his selection for.
'admonitory purposes instead of the trustees, Â¦â¢ who
were. residents. The fact that the president had noth
ing to do with the land in dispute nor its disposition
did not figure with these promoters of public rights.
t IFE is not all Greek roots and logarithms with
I American . universities. True, the epidemic or.
-Â¦â'sporadic check of the millionaire maketh glad,
the heart of the faculty and causeth the student body
to carmine the campus, and commencement comes'
and goes in great radiance. The alumni meet and
dine and put garlands on the brick or marble brow
of Alma Mater and call the roll of great men suckled
by her. The graduates go forth' in the fond -belief
that the. world is a great pie, and, using their dip
lomas as a knife, they will cut a slice therefrom that
is just their size. But they find many at life's pie
counter, and with pick and spade some chip at it;
others use the sword and some the pen, and still
others try to carve a piece with a poker hand, and
the graduate must needs compete with many in a field
that he expected to. occupy alone.
Should New York adopt the bill. other States will
be sure to follow the example.: In the meantime it is
for San Francisco to decide whether she will be a
follower or a leader in a movement so beneficial to
the public. The present high fence ordinance has
been declared invalid. A new one must be enacted.
Why not try taxation? : ,.
provides a check upon a "serious' and increasing evil,' it
tends to free 'cities Siom .-thef, dangerous nuisance of
high inflammable fences along the principal "thor
oughfares, and finally if provides Wdesirable- addition
to the revenues of the community, by f a tax which, s Â°
far from being burdensome, will be positively bene
ficial to the public. Moreover, it will be a' tax which
cannot be shifted nor evaded, for billboard and.pos
ter advertising is too cdnspicuous to be overlooked,
even by ..the most dim-eyed of tax assessors or col
lectors. " ' , ;.'Â¦''' â¢'Â¦â¢''

CHURCHES ATTENDED BT U'HE PRESIDENT AND* "WIFE AND
THEIR RESPECTIVE PASTORS. MR. ROOSEVELT'S IS THE GER
MAN REFORMED: MRS. ROOSEVELT'S IS THE ENGLISH CHURCH.
John's Church has. always been known aa
the President's church. It is also known
as the English church. More than half
the country's presidents and nearly all
the members of the British embassies
have worshiped there. It is the chief
senatorial and cabinet religious rendez
vous. The many outsiders and strangers
who flock thither generally have to wait
until the communicants are in their pews.
The church is situated on Sixteenth and
H streets, just across Lafayette . square
from the White. House, opposite Secretary
Hay's home and a block from Senator
Depew's mansion. The interior is rich
and elaborate. The vested choir and the.
mighty organ are in contrast to the vol
unteer singers and the- melodion at the
President's church.
The Rev. Mackey-Smlth, the rector of
the chjurch. is very wealthy by In
heritance and gives over his salary to
works of charity for the "Washington poor.
He lives In a fine home on Sixteenth, street
near Massachusetts avenue. Sometimes
the children attend church with Mrs.
Roosevelt. They will be left to decide for
themselves as to what church they will
become members of. These two churches
are a Sunday sight for visitors.
SOME comment has been
caused by reason cf the fact that
; President Roosevelt attends one
â¢ : church in Washington and Mrs.
Roosevelt another, says the New
York Commercial Advertiser. Some peo
ple have drawn deductions and compari
sons, and. attempted to tinge. the circum
stance with jugt a shade of sensational
ism. The President's church is democrat
ic; Mrs. Roosevelt's aristocratic, etc. The
simple fact is' that each attends the
church of his and her preference, and that
apparently is all there Is to the matter.
Both churches are small. The Presi
dent's church, the German Reformed, the
Rev. John Schick, pastor, is, ft is. true,
quite democratic. At the President's
church all strangers must come before 11
o'clock to be admitted,' for as the seats
are all free, the church is crowded by
that time. At the other only those who
come after 11:15 o'clock, when it. is sup-.,
posed alt the pew owners have taken their i
seats, are admitted. ' '
The President is of the Dutch Reformed
faith, but his church not being represent
ed at the capital, he attends the German
Reform. He is a constant and punctual
Sunday morning attendant, but he at
tends at no other time. He leaves the
south front of the White House at twenty
minutes to 11 sharp. He is generally ac
companied by two or more of his . chil
dren, and sometimes by friends he hap
pens to be entertaining.
The little church is a crude affair. It
was established twenty-three years ago
as a mission to the capital, but It was
thought several times it would have to be
abandoned. Its average membership until
recent years was but thirty-five. ' Under
the present pastor it grew to number 100
communicants.
Mrs. Roosevelt does not, like her 'hus
band, shine alone at her church. . St. j

The members of the" drill â¢ corps of tho
thirty-second degree' appeared in their
costly costumes of .black with baldric
trimmed with heavy bullion gold fringe.
Harry Ascroft, chairman of the even

which "Every Day Waltz" was rendered
by the Knickerbocker male quartet. Mrs.
Grace ' Morris Dlckman sang a contralto
solo, which was followed by a 'cello 6olo

gramme there was dancing In the main
hall and in the upper banquet hall. Dur
ing the Intermission all present adjourned
to the lower banquet hall, where a colla
tion was served.
The main hall was ' elaborately deco
rated with bunting, American flags and
streamers and rose and white net, which
relieved an artistic arrangement of silver
bullion frieze. Over the stage, which was
a bower of potted plants and shrubs,
were the letters A. A. S. R. in electric
lights. The effect of the decoration, cen
tral and mural, together with the hand
some costumes of the ladies, produce'd an
effect that was most pleasing. A novelty
in. the. decorations was the Introduction
of a number of illuminated hearts in
commemoration of St. Valentine's day. .
. The entertainment and dance given by
the several local bodies of the Scottish
Rite Mason9 In Golden Gate Hall last
night was one of the most pleasant events
that has taken place here for years.
Despite the downpour of rain there was
an attendance that filled the main hall
to its fullest seating capacity. Among
those present were many of our most
prominent citizens. There was also a
large representation of ladles who are
well known In social circles.
William Coffey, who is employed by the
American Fish Company, was held up by
two masked men at the corner of Post
and Gough streets early yesterday morn
ing and robbed of $13. Coffey,' according
to .: his story, was- walking along Post
street, and when In front of the Protes
tant Orphan Asylum was attacked by two
robbers, one of whom . thrust a revolver
in his face with tho command to throw
up his hands. After relieving him of his
money one of the desperate fellows struck
him : in the face, knocking him down.
When he regained his feet the rohbers
had disappeared.
Shortly after the occurrence Coffey met
Police Officer John Davids, to whom ho
told the- story of being held up and
robbed. Davids at once notified Lieuten
ant Martin, who promptly sent two of his
men to hunt for the robbers. They visit
ed the scene of the hold-up, but failed to
get a trace of them. ; Â¦
Coffey; described the man , who pointed
the revolver .at him as being about 5
feet 9 inches In height and dressed in a
dark suit of clothes. The other was about
four inches shorter and weighed in the
neighborhood of 160 pounds. They wore
dark masks. Coffey Is satisfied that he
could Â¦; Identify the robbers in the event
they are . arrested. '
"I have said nothing about the matter,
find did not want anything said just yet.
Some one at Washington must have given
It out. - It is true that the President said
tha:, but he was in a jovial mood, and nÂ«
doubt was just Jokingr."
Asked if he would accept the nomination.
Parry said: that' until .there was some
chance of getting it he would not antici
pate. ; ."â¢
Asked to-night If it was true that Pres
ident Roosevelt had asked him how hÂ«
would like to go on the ticket with him
In 1904, Parry said:
Senator Beveridge has told Parry and
othir friends that he will not allow the
use of his name in connection with the
Vice Presidential nomination. It Is un
derstood here that he has his eyes, on a
higher place some time in the future.
Parry was at tho head of the business

INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 14.â D. M. Parry,

ination in 1904 by_Senator Beveridge and
politicians of New "York and Pennsylva

within three weeks on the matter.
Parry was In' Washington two weeks
ago and called on the President with Sen
ator Beveridge. While the two were dis
cussing the possibility of having the Pres
ident in Indianapolis in May. when* the
National Convention of Manufacturers
will be In session, the conversation turned
to Indiana politics. President Roosevelt
jovially slapped Parry on the back and
said: '
"How would you like to be on the ticket
with me in 1904?" .
Parry smiled and said he was in Wash

* This question and the reply to it caused
Senator Morgan to enter on a course of
inquiry 'calculated to bring out the fact
that the coastwise trade would be better
nerved through the Nicaragua route than
through the Panama route. Morgan
stated that 57 per cent of this coastwise
trade is conducted by sailing vessels, and
the witness said In -. reply to the inquiry
that sailing vessels would.be better ac
commodated in the Nicaragua canal than
In the Panama canal. Senator Hanna
met these points with the statement that
comparatively little of the . coastwise
trade would cross the isthmus through
either canal. â¢ Â¦ ' - â¢'
"Taking the whole ' proposition, do you
consider the Panama proposition bettor
than the Nicaragua proposition?" asked
Hanna. ,
"I think It Is," promptly responded the
witness.
Noble said that it would be necessary
to have absolute control of the cities of
Panama and Colon in order to control
sanitation. He thought the .conditions
were favorable for yellow fever during
most of the year on the isthmus, though
he was not a sanitary engineer. There
was no yellow fever in Nicaragua eo far
as he knew. Â¦;â¢ Â¦â¢', 'L.'"
Noble- said the principal engineering
features of the Bohlo dam on the Pan
ama route were more difficult than those
of tho Conchido dam on the Nicaragua
route. As to harbors, he thought both
routes about equal, as he had no doubt
about the possibility of constructing the
Bohlo dam. t .
Noble said he considered the price of
|40 000,000 asked by the Panama Company
for its property as fair and reasonable.
The expense of operation of the two lines*
would be in proportion to the length of
the canals.
Referring to the difference in the cost
of operating the two proposed canals,
which the witness had said would
amount to about $1,300,000 annually in fa
vor of the Panama route, Senator Hanna
suggested that this would be Interest on
the capitalization of J65.O0O.O0O, buf the
witness said that he had not made any
such calculation.

Governor Gage, acting on the advice of
his counselors, declares himself a can
didate for renomination. There is no
dcubt now that he will enter the fight
vigorously to win a solid . delegation
from Los Angeles County. The anti-boss
forces of the south have resolved to give
him battle in his own county, ana the In
dications are that the contest will be one
of the liveliest character. There Is a
strong sentiment in the south in favor of
redeeming the State convention promise
of 1S3S that southern delegates would
join hands in 1902 and give the guberna
torial nomination to some Republican in
the north. There is nothing of a sectional
character in the suggestion. The prin
ciple of fair play, however, is involved.
In 1S30 H. H. Markham of Los Angeles
was nominated for Governor. In 1894 M.
M. Estee of Napa received the nomina
tion. In 1898 Henry T. Gage of Los An
geles got the nomination, as he says, by
acclamation. If the rule of fair play Is
respected a northern candidate will be
nominated this year. In the convention
at the pavilion in Sacramento In 1298 Gage
heard the declarations that the south
would come up the next time strongly in
favor of a Governor from the north. An
acceptable nominee for Governor should
surely be found In a list embracing such
eminent names as E. F. Preston, Thomas
Flint Jr.. Dr. George C. Pardee, E. P.
Colgan. Harold T. Power, E. C. Voorhels,
E. B. Edson, W. M. Cutter and N. P.
Chipman. ;~.
Democrats Are Deeply Interested.
The Democrats are taking the keenest
sort of interest in the contest for the Re
publican nomination. Leaders of that
party entertain the hope that Gage's
nomination will be forced on the Republi
can convention by the sheer weight of
pressure from the machine. They fancy
that independent anti-boss Republicans
Will not enter the campaign .with any
spirit of confidence If Gage is placed at
the head of the ticket, and placed there
by such raw political methods as Walter
Parker, John Lynch and John Mackenzie
are apt to introduce.
Stale Senator Charles iZ. Belshaw of the
Contra Costa and Marln district arrived
in the city yesterday from Los Angeles.
Senator Belshaw, accompanied by his
wife left the State last September. He
visited New York. Boston. Washington,
D. C. Montreal. St. Augustine, Charles
ton, St. Louis, New Orleans and the City
of Mexico. In Washington he was kindly
received by the President, members of the
Cabinet and the Senators and Represen
tatives of the California delegation. In
the Legislature of this State Belshaw had
the pleasure of voting for both Senators
Perkins and Bard and was accorded the
honor of nominating the senior Senator.
It is quite well known in California that
Senator Perkins owes much of his ad
vancement in public life to the manly and
honorable support of such men as Senator
Belshaw.
Thinks the Gage Forces Are "Weak.
In Southern California Belshaw sized up
the political situation and It is his Judg
ment that the Gage forces are weak and
actually despondent, although they put on
a. bold front. He says that the organiza
tion of Flint clubs is progressing and that
the members joining are men who repre
sent the best elements of citizenship. Next
Tuesday one of the clubs will give a* re
ception to Senator Flint, who arrived In
Los Angeles day before yesterday. The In
formal greeting to Flint next Tuesday
will signify whether there is any enthu
siasm in Los Angeles for Gage's boldest
opponent. _
Word comes from the south that County
Clerk Charles W. Bell of Los Angeles has
entered the contest for nomination to the
> office of Secretary of State. Truman
beeves State Treasurer, is a candidate
for renomin&tion. He was In the south at
last accounts, rallying his forces for the
fray.
SCOTTISH RITE
MASONS DANCE
THE small boy and the ardent lover,
the little girl and her big sister
remembered that yesterday was
St. Valentino's day, and each ob
Â¦;J.v served the occasion in a befitting
manner. Every youngster laid in a sup
ply of comic valentines and sent them to
the people living in his vicinity. When
his supply was exhausted he chalked a
square in the entrance way, rang the bell
and at a safe distance laughed at the
person who attempted to pick up the
phantom missive. He also borrowed old
clothes and with the assistance of his
chums fitted out a "stuffed man." The
little wretches would place this in the
path of an oncoming electric car and
watch the motorman bring his car to a
halt with a suddenness that rattled the
back teeth of the passengers.
The ardent lover took the opportunity
to send tributes of love to his adored one.
These handsomely painted affairs were
filled with extract.? from the leaves of
MASKED ROBBERS
ASSAULT VICTIM
alleged poets.-. Some of them read:
I am thine. and you are mine
And nothing can cut bur love in twine.
You're my little love
. In many of the schools the children
were. permitted to tend pretty valentines
to each other. 'Of course the teacher was
remembered, but the little girl who re
ceived the most valentines was looked
upon in envy by her classmates who were
not possessed of as many ardent ad
mirers. Her big sister waited the com
ing of the overburdened postman. If she
received an anonymous enverope contain
ing a satirical va'entlne reminding her
that she was an "old maid" she had to
grin and bear itÂ»
So. St. Valentine's day has come'and
gone. It brought pleasure to many and
disappointment to a few. Some received
handsome ones and others received cari
catures that first made them angry and
lastly, too.
Supervisors Comte, Brandenstein and
Booth were inclined to postpone action,
holding that action by the .committee
would not greatly affect the situation,
Eince attorneys and litigants would not
wait in any case for the courts to settle
the questions involved. They were on
the point, however, of recommending that
the request of the Justices that the ap
pointment of Windrow be approved be
denied. Riordan asked that no action bs
taken on that matter also, and the entire
question was postponed.
During, the discussion Ruef and Rior
dan had their usual number of tilts. In
one of these Ruef said he had been try
ing in some way to take. the question di
rect to the Supreme Court and get a final
decision, but that the Justices had de
clined to consent to this procedure. Rior
dan said that he was willing to agree to
that course and to join with Ruef in
taking the whole matter to the Supreme
Court on petitions for writs of prohibi
tion filed simultaneously by them or on
mandamus proceedings, each seeking to
compel the Justices to recognize filings
with his client. If a way can be found
to get the case before the Supreme Court
in such direct procedure that method of
settling the vexed question will doubt
less be adopted.
Postpone Entire Question.
"Meanwhile," interjected Ruef, "Win
drow is assuming duties which Judge
Cook has already said do, not belong to
him. He is usurping an office and rob
bing litigants of their,, vested property
rights. His acts and alleged official stand-
Ing should be investigated at once."
Riordan made the suggestion that a
postponement be had until Judge Cook's
decision should be rendered, which he said
he had reason to believe would not be
later than Monday or Tuesday.
"The question before Judge Cook," Ruef
said In reply, "is simply whether or not
Fredrick is de facto chief clerk and en
titled to the salary. The question you
are -asked to consider is much broader.
You are asked to determine for yourselves
who has the appointing power In this
case and to pass upon Windrow's claim
to the office."
"But, suppose," asked Supervisor Bran
denstein, "that Judge Cook chooses to
hold that Fredrick is not entitled to the
salary' unless he is de jure chief clerk and
further that he does not hold the office
de jure, would not that- dispose of a large
part of the problem?
"That ' would dispose of Fredrick's
claim," Ruef replied, "but it could not
in any way establish Windrow's claim to
the office."
"The question of the Mayor's right to
appoint," Riordan said, "is derectly in
volved, and Judge Cook will decide direct
ly whether the Mayor had that power or
whether he-did not."
Riordan Makes Suggestions.
The Judiciary Committee refused yes
terday to take up the questions Involved
In the conflicting claims of Powel Fred
rick and Joseph Windrow to the office of
chief clerk of the Justices* Court. Tha
members decided that in view of the fact
that a decision Is expected within a few
days from Superior Judge Cook that deal
with some or all phases of the problem It
would be best for "them to postpone ac
tion until they have this decision to guide
them.
Meanwhile the skein of litigation is be
coming' more tangled, and it will be many
a month before the snarl is straightened.
The Justices of the Peace refuse steadily
to recognize filings made with the May
or's appointee. Judge Cook in his instruc
tions to the Grand Jury practically de
cided that Windrow had no claim upon
the office, and many litigants are loth to
put their interests in Jeopardy by making
tilings with him. The wheels of justice
are clogged almost to stoppage, and in
the main only Interests that are threat
ened by the statute of limitations are be
ing taken into the Justices' Court In spite
of the certain ydanger of future complica
tions.
Fredrick and Windrow were both in the
Supervisors' committee room at 3 o'clock,
when the subject was taken up by the
committee. Thomas D. Riordan was on
hand to represent Windrow, while Abe
Ruef was there at attorney for the May
or and to look after the interests of Fred
rick.

Miss W. Ohilds-Blackburn, Secretary of the Eock Island
Literary and Art Society.
Writes a Special Letter to Mrs. Pink-
ham Telling How She Was Cured. 7
Â« . ; : , â â Â¦ â 'Â¦ â Â£'Â»!â¢;.
The relation of woman's nerves and generative organs is very close ; con*
sequently nine tenths of the nervous prostration, nervous despondency and
nervous irritability;. of women arise from some derangement of the organism
which makes her a woman. Herein we prove conclusively that JLyclia EÂ»
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound will quickly relieve all this trouble.
MISS W. CHILDS-BLACKBURN.
"Dear Mrs. Pinkiiam: â I take pleasure in acknowledging thft
effects of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. In my estima-
tion there is no female remedy to equal it. AVeakness not properly
attended to, together with the close confinement at my desk brought on
nervous prostration, so much so that for a year I doctored continually. I
tried different remedies which only succeeded in poisoning my system, and
my stomach refused food. A neighbor who had suffered with ovarian
troubles and was perfectly cured, called my attention to your Ve^etab le
Compound, and I made up my mind to give it a two months' fair trial.
However, before one month had passed I was like a new woman, and
after six weeks faithful use of, the Compound I was in perfect health.
It certainly is of great benefit to women, and I wish every poor suffering
woman could have a chance to try it. Yours very truly, jMiss W. Childs-
Blackburx, 2922 Fifth Ave., Rock Island, I1L M *
" Nothinjr will relieve this distressing condition so surely as
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound ; it soothes, strengthens,
heals and tones up the delicate female organism. It is a positive
cure for all kinds of female complaints ; that bearing: down feeling-,
backache, displacement of the womb. Inflammation of the ovaries
and is invaluable during: the change of life.
Â» ' How Mrs. Pinkham helped firs. Borst.
"Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â When I wrote to you some time ago for
1 advice I really thought my days were numbered. I was so ill that I
could not stand on my feet for fifteen minutes at a timo. I had female
troubles in many of their worst forms ; inflammation and ulceration of
the womb; leucorrhoea; bearing down pains; headache and backache:
nervous prostration. My kidneys were out of order and blood in a bad
condition. Everyone, and even my doctor thought I was going into
consumption. I followed your advice faithfully for six months with the
result that I became a 5 well woman, and it cost me much less than a doc-
tor's bill. I feel that Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
saved my life." â Mrs., Samuel Borst, 7 Cozy Ave.; Oneonta, N. Y.
The above letter shows how unerring is the atjvicc which Mrs. Pinkham
gives to women who write her about their sickness ; as the advice is free and
always helpful it is not strange that she advises more than one hundred
thousand sick women every year. Her address is Lynn, Mass. > ._^ L

Trouble Over Horseshoeing.
The Supervisors' Police Committee and
the Police Commission are at loggerheads
over the matter of horseshoeing in the
police department and interesting devel-"
opments are expected. During the past
year the shoeing was done by five shops,
under tha direction of Supervisor Tobin
who was chairman of the Police Com
mittee. The Police . Commission winked
at the .violation of the charter, which
says that such work must go to the low
est bidder. "When Supervisor Boxton wa3
made chairman of the Police Committee
the old order was changed and the job
of shoeing forty-eight horses, at $2 50 per
horse, was given to Eddy Graney. Gra
ney, however, has not shod the horses,
because* the commission will not let him
do the work. "

POLICEMEN THANK
A GENEROUS GIVER
City Attorney Says Consent of Sutro
Estate Heirs Must Be Obtained
for Time Extension.
City Attorney Lane advised the Board
of Supervisors yesterday that the execu
tors of the Sutro estate have not the
power to grant an extension of two years'
time within which to complete the Dewey
Boulevard, nor have they the power to
consent to a modification of the condi
tions of the deed conveying the lands for
the thoroughfare. The end sought, how
ever, by such modification of the con
tract may be possible of attainment
through the consent of all interested In
the estate. Such powers must arise either
from those expressly granted to the ex
ecutors or must flow from the general
grant to be found In the law, and from
neither of such sources can the power
sought be derived, as neither the will nor
the law makes such grant.
Unless the consent of the heirs Is ob
tained, the land conveyed by Adolph Su
tro will revert to the estate and Dewey
Boulevard will remain in an unfinished
state, as the time within whlcbrthe city
was to have completed the improvement
Is about to expire.

The most ambitious circuit of dog shows
ever held' on this coast has been planned
for . April. L. A. Klein, manager of the
San Francisco Kennel Club show, is one
of the prime movers in the matter.
There will probably , be seven shows in
all..' A start will be made during the first
week in April at Victoria, B. C. Then in
succession will follow : Portland, Seattle,
San Francisco and Los Angeles. There
will be an open week after this show and
it is hoped to induce San Jose fanciers to
avail themselves of the opportunity of
giving a show in the Garden City. After
this the scene of operations will be shifted
to Sacramento; where the annual Street
Fair will be in fullswing.
Dog fanciers throughout the coast are
interested in the circuit. The best dogs
from here will go north and the northern
dogs will come south. In the same man
ner - there will be an interchange of
judges. It Is expected a number of East
ern experts will be here and will change
about judging different breeds at different
shows. /
The show which will be held here al
ready gives promise of being the most im
portant one held in this city. The dogs
will not be, benched as is past shows. In
stead of being laid out on- straight lines
the kennels will be scattered about the
entire lower floor of Mechanics' Pavilion.
Each kennel will be separate, thus giving
owners an opportunity for artistic deco
rating, ornamenting the temporary homes
of their dogs as , they see fit.
The coursing Â¦ men have -taken up. the
show in earnest and promise the greatest
collection of greyhounds ever seen in
America. The California Coursing Com
mittee, the governing body of the sport,
has assumed charge of this section. The
following gentlemen will represent it: J.
H. Rosseter, -H. A. Deckelman, JEJ.E.
Shotwell, P. M. Clarkson and George
MacE.. Malcolm. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ . : â¢ Â¦ â¢ .- Â¦"Â¦ ,
The committee ,will select the judge, who
will then be named by the bench show
officials. There will be a reception room
connected â¢* with the greyhound â¢ section,
where light refreshments will be served.
It is .the intention of . the Â¦ leashmen to
endeavor to make their exhibit the most
interesting in the show* . ....
The prizes will be liberal. For the Best
greyhound in the show ' there . will â¢ be a
$100 cup. In addition there will be many
money prizes. , â¢ â¢
â¢One of the features of the show.will.be
a competition for a $100. cup to be awarded
to Â¦ the best team : of four of . any breed.
This will be Judged on the first evening of
the show by a jury made : up of all . the
judges. .There will also be a sweepstakes
for. the best brace of any breed, to be
judged under the same conditions.
The proceeds of the -. show â¢ will be 'de
voted Â»to "charity. ,..-
The uncertain weather of the past week
was not the besÂ£ for tennis, but when the
skies -rcere clear play was exceedingly
heavy. . As the days grow longer the
cracks are able to get some' practice after
business hours. It is doubtful if the courts
will be able to accommodate the players
who will get out in the late afternoon a
month . from now.
A handicap singles tournament on the
22d of February will be the opening event
of the spring season on the California Club
courts. It has not been decided whether
it will be a straight handicap or a class
singles. The latter seems the more popu
lar of the two f orms â¢ of playing at pres
ent. As It is more satisfactory to the
players, it will probably be selected. It
will be an open tournament and will be
the largest ever held on the club courts.
Interest centers chiefly in the first and
second classes. In these the players are
evenly matched and it would be a difficult
matter to pick the winners. Several of
the best park players, Dunlap, Routh,
Beyfuss apd others, will enter. Many en
tries are also expected from Alameda
County.
The most important events following the
Washington's birthday tournament will be
the intercollegiate matches and the cham
pionship tournaments of the Ojai Valley.
Both will be held in the latter part of
April.
The University of California tryout is
looked forword to with more interest than
is the intercollegiate tournament. At
Berkeley, there are half a dozen men. who
are so evenly matched that nothing but
a tryout could settle the question of su
premacy. Some interesting matches will
result from a meeting of such men as
MacGavin, Brown, Hunt, Braly, Hendrick
and Baker, who are all first-class players.
The enthusiasts of Ojai Valley are anx
ious to get some of the -local cracks to
take part in their championship tourna
ment this year, but it is not likely any
will go. If the experts from this city go
south it will be to Santa Monica to com
pete for the championships of Southern
California. The Southerners Â¦ are desirous
of having Grant Smith go south. Mrs.
Klncaid will try for the women's cham
pionship held by Mrs. Garland. The Ojai
Valley tournament will be held on April
24, 25 and 26, and will consist of the fol
lowing events: Ladies' singles and.dou
bles, mixed doubles and gentlemen's sin
gles and doubles. The Interscholastic
championship will also be decided. Hen
drick is the present champion.
Joe Tobin showed well in practice last
week. His half -speed drive Is accurate.
At present the four most enthusiastic
players on the courts are Judges Hunt,
Troutt and . Kerrigan . and Dr. Morrow.
These four Indulge in some lively double
matches.
' The trapshooters apparently believe a
wise move was made in the amalgamation
of the Olympic, Lincoln and San Fran
cisco gun clubs under the name of Golden
Gate Gun Club.
A permanent organization was effected
last night with the election of the follow
ing officers: President, H. B. Hosmer; vice
president, George H. T. Jackson
Ing secretary, Stanley G. Scovern; treas
urer, M. O. ' Feudner: directors, E. A.
Wands, Edgar L. Forster, Charles H.
Shaw.
The club starts with a membership of
fifty and the charter will be kept open
until April 1. The members will shoot
on the second and fourth Sundays of the
month, one day being devoted to live birds
and the other to bluerocks. The initia
tion fee will be $5 and the yearly dues $12,
payable $2 per month during the shooting
season. â¢ . . -' â¢ .
The matter of a shoot on Washington's
birthday was referred to the directors.
The members are in favor of holding one.
The question of handicapping or classify
ing the shooters was also referred to the
directors. Clarence Nauman and Edgar
Forster each submitted systems of handi
capping. .
Clarence Nauman is enthusiastic over
the wild goose shooting provided by
"Doc" Stuart and his party at Norman,
Glenn County. Mr. Nauman killed 103
in a day's shooting. Although the birds
come within close range, the shooting is
difficult, as they dart upward with great
speed. Mr. Nauman is organizing a party
to spend another, day In the field.
At the regular meeting, of the Alameda
Boating Club on Tuesday night twelve
new members were elected and nine ap
plications for membership were received.
The boathouse has been put in thorough
repair, some of the underpinning having
been renewed. The meeting room has
been comfortably furnished and supplied
with additional electric lights, j The club
is in a flourishing condition and. expects
to have a lfc-ely and successful .season.
Among the new members are several
young men who are desirous to learn to
row and to take â¢ part in open* regattas
and club races. It is exp'ected the open
ing day will be held early In April, and
later in the season a moonlight fete- - will
be got up similar to those of ' previous
year3, but on a larger and more elaborate
scale. Preparations for this entertain
ment will begin soon after the season
opens. , i Â¦ .
The suggestion of the Superintendent
of Public Schools in Alameda that a piece

ground before all the suitable tracts have
been covered with' buildings was dis
cussed at -some length and met with un
qualified approval. Â¦ The members are of
the opinion that field sports and . outdoor
recreations are â¢ necessary parts , of any
system of sound education and have
pledged themselves to do all in their
power, both as a club and as individuals,
to further the acquisition of a public
recreation ground. . â¢
Throughout the winter many members
of the Alameda - Boating Club have been
in the habit of rowing on the estuary
and are in good trim for the coming sea
son. All the club boats . will soon be
overhauled. It is probable some addi
tions will be made to the stock of boats,
oars and other equipment owned by the
club. The prospect for the coming year
is promising, and it is expected the club
will be fully able to maintain its high
place in aquatic sports. .,
The only city club that is manifesting
much aquatic activity at present is the
Dolphin Boating Club.- On Sunday last
a four-oared barge crew, . consisting of
E. , O. Kragness, John- Reimers; T. R.
Dixon and Leo Wienand," went out 'for
practice. It is likely^ this crew .will stay
together and will represent the club in
the -junior barge race, at the first open
regatta of the season. F. â¢ J. Sherry is
practicing in the outrigged skiff. A partv
of fourteen members of the Dolphin Club
rowed from North Beach to Tiburon last
Sunday . In one of the large pleasure
barges, taking forty minutes for the i trip.
After enjoying dinner on Albert P: Roth
kopf's ark they rowed back to the city,
the trip against a' flood tide occupying
two hours and ten minutes.
L.* A: Weidenmuller, a member of the
Corinthian Yacht Club, is a candidate
for membership in the Dolphin Boating

ANOTHER TOURNAMENT
At the annual meeting of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club, which was held on
"Wednesday evening ' in . the Merchants'
Exchange, the regular 'ticket as nomi
nated by Dr. T. L. Hill. W. G. Morrow
and J. R. Savory was elected unanimous
ly. The report of the retiring commodore.
-W. N. McCarthy, for the past year show
ed that the club, while it lost several
members from resignation, death or ex
pulsion, had gained a larger number, of
new members, so that It now has 130 ac
tive members, as against 113 In 1901.
Commodore McCarthy stated that Las
Amigas, the ladles' club, which has the
use of the clubhouse at certain times, had
turned, over to the treasurer the sum or
$103 as the result of an entertainment
given in aid of the fund for finishing the
main hall. To this sum the directors
have added $250, and several member3
have lent their aid on Sundays and Hi
the evenings to put up the lining and do
other work on the hall. The commodore
stated the club had given a clam bako
instead of one of the scheduled dancer,
and recommended that this policy be fol
lowed, since a clam bake attracts yachts
men and promotes their acquaintance
with each other, while dances are attend
ed chiefly by men who do not advance
the interests of the club. He stated -tha
Crowninshield yacht, which is nearly
ready for launching, is the best construct
ed vessel ever built here. He suggested
that a collection should be made of
photographs of all the boats that have
contended for the Perpetual Challenge
cup.
The club began the year 1901 with a debt
of about $600 left by the previous board,
but this was wiped off and a small bal
ance on the right side is in the treas
urer's hands. It will, however, be neces
sary during the coming year, in order to
save the club property from deteriora
tion, to paint the clubhouse, which will
cost about $230. Dr. T. L. Hill recom
mended that when the membership roll
reaches 130 an initiation fee of $20 be re
quired to be paid with an application for
membership. At present there is no en
trance fee, and a member has no finan
cial interest to induce him to remain a.
member when he can resign and be re
elected at a future time without any
other liability than for the annual dues.
Secretary W. M. Edgell's report com
mented on the apathy and lack of club
spirit as evidenced by the fact th^t on.
one occasion he received only thirteen
and on another only twenty replies to
140 reply postal cards sent out. He also
urged the printing of a new book con
taining the roll of members and yachts,
and the new racing rules as prepared by
the regatta committee, stating he fre
quently receives such books, from other
yacht clubs, but is unable to send any
thing in return.
A communication was read from Gov
ernor George W. Baxter of Monterey, re
questing that the commodore in drawing
up a schedule of events for 1902 make ar
rangements for a cruise to Monterey and
a race in the bay there for a cup to be
presented by himself and contended for
under conditions drawn up by the regat
ta committee. The receipt of the Gov
ernor's letter has been acknowledged
and the matter referred to the board of
directors.
W. G. Morrow on behalf of the syndi
cate by whom the challenger is being:
built, stated that the total cost will be
$2451. nearly all of which has already
been collected. The work of construction
has been greatly aided by the timely and
generous assistance of James Kitterman.
formerly port captain. A hearty vote of
thanks was given to him for hia valuable
help with regard to tha building of the
challenger and for his wmingness on
other occasions to give the use of his fine
launch America for club cruises and tow
ing up creeks.
A suggestion that a. certain sum bo set
aside monthly to reduca the mortgage on
the clubhouse and that all rent received
for the hire of the main hall be devoted
to the same purpose provoked consider
able discussion. As the whole clubhouse
must be painted this year, and It is pro
posed to complete the decoration of the
main hall and to add a float on the north
side of the wharf, it Is hardly likely that
much can be done during 1902 to reduce
the indebtedness, especially as the race
for the Challenge cun is certain to call
for some expenditures. Dr. T. L. Hill is
in favor of giving a benefit performance
at the Tlyoll. and a committee of two will
be appointed to confer with the Tlvoll
management on this matter. "With the
cordial support of the members of the
yacht clutt and their friends the house
ought to be well filled and the perform
ance to result in substantial gain to the
club.
The newly elected directors of the Co
rinthian Yacht Club met for the first
time on Thursday night.
Although the Oakland golf team suc
ceeded in last Saturday's match on the
Point Adams links in reducing the lead
obtained by the San Francisco golfers on
Saturday. February 1, as was expected,
it was unable to win. The Oaklanders,
however, made a gallant struggle, five of
their men scoring an aggregate of 19 up
against the visitors. The only Presidio
golfer out of the first six men on the team
to defeat his opponent was John Lawson,
who beat E. R. Folger 2 up In the first
round and 1 up in the Becond round, mak
ing- 3 up on the eighteen holes. At this
stage Oakland was 16 up, with two
couples to be heard from. By an error
in signaling from the top of the hilr to
the waiting crowd at the home green It
was understood that A. H. Higgins was 3
up 2 to play on L. O. Kellogg. When the
match ended L. O. Kellogg proved to be 4
up, and as H. C. Golcher beat G. p.
Greenwood 1 up the Oakland totai for the
match was 11 up, which, deducteo. from
the 18 up scored by San Francisco lu the
first half, left the Presidio men winners
1 up. " â¢"'Â¦
Some of the players were under the im
pression that the loss of the' match meant
that the Oaklanders would have to give
up the trophy for good. But this is not
so The cup will remain in the San * ran
cisco golf clubhouse until the next match
has been played, which will be in April.
If the Oakland team should win the sec
ond 36-hole match a. tie will result, which
will be played off over eighteen holes on
neutral links. This happened in 1899, in
which year the Oakland team beat the
San Francisco men in the deciding match
on the links of the Burlingame Country
Club.
Next Thursday, the 20th inst., play will
begin on the links of the Los Angeles
Country Club for the men's amateur
championship of Southern California, at
present held by Walter Fairbanks of Den
ver. It is understood the champion will
be on hand to defend his title. Other par
tciipants in the contest will be C. E.
Maud, twice runner-up for the champion
ship and winner of the Del Monte cup
for two years: C. E. Orr, champion of
1300; H. M. Sears and Winsor Walton.
The Qualifying round, over thirty-six
holes, will be played on the first day. On
Friday, February 21, the first and semi
final founds of match play, over eighteen
holes, will be decided. On Saturday, Feb
ruary 22. the final round, over thirty-six
holes, will dp played.
Early in March, the second competition
for the Pacific Coast Golf Association's
men's amateur championship will be
played on the links of the Los Angeles
Country Club. It is believed that Ernest
R. Folger, who won the championship
when it was first competed for last year
on the Presidio links, will go down to
Southern California to defend his title. It
is hoped John Lawson, who has been
playing a strong game recently and has
defeated E. K. Folger both on the Pre
sidio links and the Oakland links, will
also make the journey. Whether B. D.
Adam son will go is doubtful, but J. W.
Byrne and L. O. Kellogg are likely to
make the trip. In addition to E. R. Fol
ger it is likely that W. P. Johnson. F. S.
Stratton, R. M. Fitzgerald and J. A. Fol
ger will go. All of these devote a great
deal of time to .golf and are strong play
ers. Except J. A. Folger, who has played
lately on the links of the Burlingame
Country Club, none of them has had much
experience on the "skin" greens of South
ern jCalifornia.
On Monday morning next at 9:30 o'clock
the qualifying round, over eighteen hales,
medal play, for the first competiton for
the next Council's cup for ladies will be
played on the links of the San Francisco
Golf Club. The eight ladies who make
the lowest scores will play in the opening
match round on Wednesday.
On "Washington's birthday there will be
competitions for ladies and for men- on
the links of the Sausalito Golf Club, both
being handicap medal play contests over
nine holes. Play will begin at 10 o'clock
in the morning, and prizes will be given
to the -winners of each event- .

It is thought that there Â¦ are others
killed or buried under the sand at tHe
scene of the wreck, as there are several
missing and yet unaccounted for. A crew
of workmen are clearing the wreck and
looking for the bodies. If the engineer
had not stopped the train when he did the
entire train might have been hurled down
the embankment.
Just back of the caboose there were
three cars of sand and many of the men
were burled underneath the sand, which
was thrown forward by the terrific im
pact. Six men are known to have been
Killed outright. Three were left on the
scene and three were brought to Little
Rock on a train that was dispatched to
the scene as soon as the news could be
sent to the city. Fifteen injured persons
were brought to Little Rock and are now
at St. Vincent's Infirmary. One of the
most seriously Injured died on the way
to the hospital from the station.
The train was going; slowly, but was,
almost upon the rocic when it struck the'
track. Engineer Nasor reversed his en
gine at once, but the rock struct' it with
almost full force. The caboose was at the
head of the train and Â¦was broken into
splinters. Most of the men who were
killed and injured were in the caboose.
There was a crew of fifty-four men,
white and colored. - ,
The work train was headed west, the
engine pushing six cars and a caboose. It
was in charge of Conductor G. R. Gamble
and Engineer Nasor and Fireman W. H.
Evans. As the train was passing under
the high bluffs bordering the river, two
miles west of Little Maumelle, the crew
saw a heavy rock rolling down the steep
declivity, it having been detached from
the hillside by the rains.

WASHINGTON. Feb. 14.â The War De
partment's bill for the reorganization of
army staff branches and the creation of
a general Etaff corps was transmitted to
day to Chairman Hull of the House Mili
tary Committee and by him Introduced.
It consolidates the quartermasters', sub
sistence and pay departments Into a di
vision of supplies under an officer rank
ibg as major general, with brigadier gen
erals in charge of the branches of sup
ply, commissary, finance and transporta
tion. The "General Staff Corps" is to
consider the "military policy of the coun
try and prepare comprehensive plans for
the national defense and for the mobil
ization of the military forces in time of
Â¦war." It also has charge of all questions
affecting the army and the co-operation
of the army and navy, plans of campaign,
armament, equipment, etc A lieutenant
general is at the head of this board with
one major general, one brigadier general,
four colonels and numerous officers of
lower rank.
The provision creating the general staff
corps follows:
The President is authorized to detail from
the army at large officers of the rank here
inafter named, who shall be designated the
general staff corps and whose duties shall be:
To consider the military policy of the coun
try and prepare comprehensive plans for the
national defense and for the mobilization of
the military forces in time of war. To con
eider and report on all Questions affecting â¢ the
welfare and effioacy of the army. Including
organization, methods of administration, arma
ment, equipment, transportation, plans of cam
paign, collection of military Information and
such other professional -matter &s^ -may . be_. re
ferred to them.
To devise means for the co-operation of the
military and naval forces of the United SU.tes
with & view to harmonious action In time of
war. To prepare and supervise the preparation
and arrangement of material for the military
history of the United States, and to serve as
an afc-ency through which all means of pro
fessional military Information Ehall be. at any
time, at the disposal of the War Department.
The chief of the general staff is to have the
rank of lieutenant general, and is to be detailed
by the president from officers not below the
grade of brigadier general. With him are as
sociated a major general, >6ne brigadier gen
eral, four colonels, six lieutenant colonels,
twelve majors and twelve captains. There >Â¦>
a proviso that General Miles shall be chief of
the general Â«staff while he continues in com
mand.
Inspection of troops is to be made by the
general etaff and the inspection of money ac
counts is transferred to the Treasury Depart
ment. Provision is made for the gradual ab
eorption of the inspector general's branch by
the general staff corps, and its ultimate discon
tinuance. Provision is made for the promo
tion of non-commissioned officers to the grade
of eecond lieutenant by a system of examina
tions, and a number of ether provisions de
eigned to increase our military efficiency are
incorporated in the measure. - â¢ - -
The Secretary of War is given authority to
take poesession of vessels for military purposes
upon a reasonable charter price. Patents by
army officers are made the property of the
United States. The number of military cadets
to be appointed by the President is not to ex
ceed ten Â«r year.
"We have no business to sit silent while
women who go as teachers, as commis
sioners and as benefactors of the 'Islands
are under perfect subjection to, men"
, The convention then took up the ques
tion'of deciding "upon th'e next place of
meeting in 1003. Niagara Falls. St. Louis
Denver, New Orleans and Baltimore were
in the field for the honor. The Rev
Anna Shaw* strongly favored New Orleans
and moved that the invitation from that
city be accepted. The motion was unani
mously carried, - . "; . .
Toward the. close of the afternoon ses
sion" ex-Senator Frank Cannon of Utah
addressed the convention. He declared
that- 'women, have .the right to vote the
BB.zaes as, men. The. only question involved
was, is I it ;a duty ? : Men discharged the
duty of voting in -their, own 1 way, but the
question. -was . whether ; ,they have dis
charged, their duty before God; and man
kind 1 so .that -women are not needed to
assist In Its discharge. ' At one time he
rhad been, opposed to', woman suffrage
said, but he. long since had changed' hit*
mlnd.'\< It was: the women who,; had
brought' about- the redemption" l ofÂ»'New
York; City." He concluded by - asserting
that women' will hot degrade politics
"Think of them being put under the
heel- of barbarians of the Philippines and
the barbarians sent- from this country
who are worse than the Filipinos. '
' This latter 4 remark was loudly ap
plauded." Continuing, she said:' â¢
"Therefore," she said, "we- must go to
them." She pleaded for suffrage for the
women of Hawaii, Porto Rico and the
Philippines. After referring to the school
teachers who had gone to the Philippine
Islands, she said:
Susan B. Anthony said she believed in
carrying the gospel of woman suffrage to
every convention of men and women that
could "' be ' reached, because Catholics
Presbyterians, Congressmen and others
never come to the conventions.
Plea for the Islanders.
' Speaking in behalf of the committee on
legislation. Gail Laughlin said that their
duties were somewhat restricted from the
fact that this is "an off year" in politics,
but that in eight States holding elections
this year the State suffrage associations
are making efforts to obtain larger rights.
"It behooves us," said Mrs. Catt, "to
hasten the day when women may vote in
order that they may be eligible not only
for Government positions, but that they
may have an equal opportunity with men
In all'-the industrial lines of work."
Mrs. Catt said in response to these re
marks that it was not so much a wonder
that woman Is being closed out as it Is a
wonder -that she ever was appointed at
all. Only the depletion of the number
of men during the Civil War, she said,
was responsible for women holding office.
As the pressure for patronage grows
stronger, she declared, it is but natural
that those who have no votes shall be
considered less and less eligible for Gov
ernment positions.
When: the convention was called to or
der Clara Bewick Coldy delivered an ad
dress on "Industrial Problems." In which
she criticized' the pending legislation in
Congress providing for the abolishment of
sick leave of Government clerks, on the
ground that women were constantly ab
senting themselves. This, she said, was
a covert attack on womanhood. In the
Interstate Commerce Commission, where
no Women are employed, she said, the
percentage of absence for sickness was
greatest.
Sick Leave for Clerks.
Miss Mando of Maryland agreed with
the suggestion of Mrs. De Merrltt, saying
that a woman in | looking over a paper
for recipes: for mince pie and fruit cake
or something to beautify her complexion
will stumble across a paragraph about
woman suffrage if there is a woman's
column and that she will undoubtedly
read and digest- it.
Mrs. Chesbrough of Buffalo pleaded for
clear, condensed and up-to-date articles
for' the- press. The" '."difficulty that the
wotnan suffrage organization encountered,
she said, was in furnishing to the news
papers something new, showing what adÂ«
vance has been and is being made in the
work. -
Mrs. Funk of Maryland said her ex
perience .had been that when articles were
properlyi prepared the newspapers accept
ed' them. A "suggestion from Mrs. De
Merritt'was favorably received. Her idea
was to have the newspapers adopt a
"woman's column," devoted to .woman
suffrage in the main, but seasoned with
other items of interest.

found newspaper work the greatest factor

Otto C. Flototatvthe -close of- the fifth'
round announced he would disqualify the
man who failed to break clean. As Arm
strong up to this time had kept the agree

warning was aimed at. -Everything went
all. right until the seventh; when Parker
let fly a stiff right jab to Armstrong's ribs
just as the men had come to .'& .clinch.
This, while it did no damage, was quickly
noticed by the referee, who disqualified
the Kid and awarded decision to
Armstrong. Armstrong floored the | Kid
several times with/ right 'swings to -the

aging, forced Parker, on one occasion to
remain down eight seconds.- .

tested fight that has ever taken
place in Oakland. There were many who
thought that after the draw battle be
tween these two men on July 4 last the
fight to-night would be tame. In this
they were agreeably disappointed. The
fight started in from thrf first round and
lasted until Nelll completed his work in
the tenth with an uppercut that landed
squarely on Thurston's Jaw. It was ten
minutes before he recovered conscious
ness. There was not a moment of the
OAKLAND. Feb. 14.â Al Nelll
knocked Charles Thurston out In
the tenth round of the fastest,
hardest and most stubbornly con-
ninth, round; giving Thurston Â¦ the elbow.
This made Thurston: angry and /in '.the
tenth- round there was. a whirlwind' of
fighting, in .which Thurston got the worst
of the argument. " The 'round' culminated

Neill started out with a steady deter
mination to win his fight," and even the
wonderful recuperative powers of Thurs
ton could not overcome the .persistent
hammering that Nelll . administered.- Dur
ing the early ptÂ»rt of the fight JCeilli kept
persistently punching- Thurston ; In- the
8tomR.cn. and in the fifth rourid landed
a right-hand swing that . fairly - lifted
Thurston off the ground and caus'ed him
to groan. . r : . ;-

to Green Morris for the services of O'Con
nor than did P. Ryan, so Winnie will
pilot Diderot' Instead of Obia. As All
Green Is, a non-starter, John Buflman at
last accounts was disengaged.
and his measurements show him to be
larger all over, as the accompanying table
indicates. - Irwin is much larger about the
chest and waist: His underpinning is also
much stouter, but in his work Britt has
always shown sufficient strength In that
quarter to carry him through the fastest
bouts. Irwin. has the longer spread of
arms. Not much Importance attaches to
this. "Walcott has a short reach, but per
forms â¢wonders, j
Britt's'work has attracted many visitors
to his training quarters. Those who saw
him. boxing with Leonard and Long wit
nessed some remarkably clever glove work
and hard hitting. He has practically end
ed his training and will taKe only such ex
ercise as will keep him in health.
An unusually, large crowd will cross the

POSTUM^CEREAL.
A STEADY WORKER.
CoSee Works Slow but Sure.
Many people use coffee day after day
Â¦without an idea of the serious work it
does with nerves, stomach, bowels and
sometimes with the eyes, heart and kid-
neys. Its work is done gradually; that is,
the poison affects the nerve centers a lit-
tle to-day and a little to-morrow and: so
on, and finally the nerve cells are slowly
broken down and then Nature begins the
call for help.
It is a safe proposition that if a man
or woman has headaches, stomach trou-
ble or any such ailments come on at in-
tervals, something is wrong: with the
food or drink, and this question should be
investigated carefully, for healthy is the
best capital anyone can possess and will-
fully breaking it down is a piece of child-
ish folly.
It is easy to leave off coffee if one will
take Postum Food Coffee." properly made,'
for Postum has a delicious coffee flavor
and a deep, seal-brown color,' which
changes to a fedden brown when cream
is added, -and it satisfies the coffee
drinker without any of the bad effects "of
coffee; on the contrary, the result -of
Â¦using Postum is the rebuilding of the
broken-down nerve centers by the food
elements contained In It.
Postum Is a pure food beverage made
by scientific food makers and can be de- \
pended upon absolutely for Its- purity!
and the good results tha.t follow Its use.
To bring out the flavor and food value
Postum must be boiled' at !eaÂ«t 15 min-
utes after the boiling begins.

NEW YORK. Feb. 14.â The reaction which
developed in yesterday's stock market con
t nuÂ«"l this mornir-s. but was checked during
the day and a level of prices was established
ruhFlantial'y above last night. The market
became unsteady again and closed rather
heavy. The question of a tax on stocks as
collateral for call loans seemed to play an
effective part^ in the day' 6 dealings, yester
day's decision. to collect the tax being appar
ently lesponsible for the weakness of the mar
ket this morning. Later reports that the ques
tion was still open to construction was followed
fcy the rally in the market. The special stocks
v-hlch rulÂ«>d the recovery f.-ere^apparently in
fluenced by individual causes also. The deal
inpF in Colorado Southern were on a very large
scale.. The preferred stocks were also strong. <
The rumor )n the Ftreet to account for the
movement is that competition for control vt
the road is goinp on. probably between Union
J aciftc and the Gould interests. The strength
of Sugar was due to the decision to take up
the Cuban rr-ciprocity Question in Congress af
ter the war tax reduction measure Js out of j
ine way. Baltimore and Ohio was In very I
acMvr cemand and more than' recovered its
wmi-annual dividend of 2 per cent, which
came off this morning. Brooklyn Transit
ma<!e a notable recovery from yesterday's de- '
Iiression and Manhattan yts strong - In sym
pathy, but Metropolitan Street Railway fell
away over a jjolnt at the last. No public an
nouncement had been made in the street of
the Metropolitan's readjustment plan. The
Chicago and Great Western 'stocks roee from
1 to 2 per cent on reports that the company
had acquired the St. Joseph and Grand Islanj.
Southern Railway preferred rose on the belief
that it is to tie plaeed on a 5 per cent dividend
basis. The- advance In Southern Pacific wasT
aiso resumed for. over a point. Amalgamated
Copper was' the leader of, the specialties in
point of activity, and dropped 1% at cne time.
The Glucose Sugar stocks lost 2% each. Some
of the minor stocks which have recently ad
vanced suffered particularly from profit-tak
ing in the morning. Burlington, Cedar Rapids
and Xorthern Jumped 6 points on two transac
tions. Sterling exchange hardened slightly to
day. The reduction in the pr'ce of gold in
London shows that the pressure for gold from
Paris h3Â» relaxed, which makes demand upon
New York for gold Improbable.
Bonds were again active, but' the movement
of price* was irregular. Total sales, par value.

CHICAGO.NFeb. 14. â Wheat ruled dull and
weak throughout the day. Yesterday the hope
of a better export business and a good short
demand had strengthened the tone materially.
To-day, however, the better export demand
did not appear -as -expected, and there waÂ«
practically no short demand to keep up prices.
Cables at Â¦ the start were a little better, but
the slight Bain was soon lost.- Outsiders kept
out of the buying side of the market and locals
sold both. The small cash demand growing
bearish sentiment , contributed - to the decline.
Stop-loss orders .were reached ' on the decline
and this occasioned more selling. May opened
a shade to %@Hc lower at 78%@78%c, sold
oft to 78c and closed weak, %@%c lower at
78}ic Â¦ .. . - -..â¢-,.-..Â¦.
Corn trade was small with a leaning most of
the tlmo to the selling side. -May closed weak,
%c lower at 61%@62c. ; . . : .Â¦
Oats' were almost featureless. May closed
easy, : %c oft at 43%c. '- Â¦
There was very little doing in provisions.
The grain weakness - and large hog receipts
caused a weak market. May pork closed - 2%o
down, lard 7}Â»>c lower and ribs 2%@5c down.

Butter Is higher, in spite of larger receipts,
as there is now a lively demand for both local
and northern shipping -account, and stocks are
very, light. In "fact, .there is not much Butter
here. The demand is chiefly for the medium
grades, or to be more specific, for first-class
goods at second-class prices, if the buyers can
persuade sellers to sell that way. The exhaus
tion of packed goods has led to a largely in
creased'call for dairy and other second grade
descriptions, and the market is stiff at the
advance. '
Eggs are. easy in spite of the shipping and
Lenten demand, as receipts have been much
larger during the past several days. The north
would be liberal buyers in this market if they
could get a concession of a cent or two, and
even as it is they are taking hold of the mar
ket very well.

Wagner's debate was clever. He pre

hearers. The debate was. close, for the
judges labored together nearly: _half. an
hour before the decision was made.
In spite of the rain that fell steadily
Harmon Gymnasium was crowded. Every
seat was occupied and the standing space
around the galleries filled. From the
known number of chairs in. the big build-

heard the debate. The front seats on the

THE DAY'S DEAD
"The Court Commissioner, having no
bond," said Snook to-day, "is In a posi
tion where he cannot be punished for
any wrong act. But as the law requires
That he shall give bonds we may take
steps to force him to furnish them.
Vv'e are not making any move at all to
circumvent the other side In the matter
of Daniels' arrest. If the Sheriff arrests
him then we will do something. "What
that will be I am not prepared to say."
If a subpena can be served on D. Ed
ward Collins, the plaintiff In the suit, his
deposition will be taken to-morrow morn-
Ing in Attorney William Lair Hill's office
before Notary Public Sarah M. Steele.
Attorney Snook directed to-day that Col
lins be served with a subpena ordering
him to appear. The defendants wanted
Collins to testify a week ago, but he went
off to Southern California before they
could serve him with a 6ubpena. Now
that he is back, however, there may be
r.o trouble in serving him.
The demurrer of Henry P. Dalton to
the Collins complaint, was to have been
heard this morning in Judge Ogden's
court, but as all the defendants had not
appeared in the matter the Judge said
he preferred that argument be deferred.
The attorneys consented to the proposal
end next Friday was set as the time
when the demurrers will be taken up
Attorney Snook, in behalf of the de
tense, has discovered that no penalty for
false arrest can be visited upon Court
Commissioner Babcock, because he has
not filed an official bond, although there
is a section of the code that requires that
every official shall file a bond when he
takes office. Â«
Hay Take Steps Against Commissioner
In the meantime the parties to the con
troversy will remain passive. In case the
pistrtct Attorney says the Sheriff Is safe
in arresting Daniels and the Sheriff ar
rests him, the defendant's attorney will
proceed to have him released on habeas
corpus proceedings heard in a regular
court of record.' Should the Sheriff de
cline to make the arrest on the advice of
the District Attorney, the attorneys for
the plaintiff will take tbe necessary steps
to force him to do so through mandamus
proceedings. In any case the disputed
.question will be taken before the Supreme
Court and decided there definitely.
Will Appeal to Supreme Court.
District Attorney Allen says that there
are two questions to be solved by him in
determining the legality of the duty im
posed upon the Sheriff. One of these is
the right of the Court Commissioner to
exercise judicial powers and the other the
lig-ht to issue a warrant for anybody's
arrest, even if he lias the judicial powers.
These points he will determine to-morrow
in time to submit an opinion so that the
Court Commissioner can act upon it when
he orders his court in session at 1 o'clock.
â¢â¢This is a case where an arrest is made
in a willful manner," said the Sherilf,
"and the person making an arrest with
out legal authority puts himself and
bondemen in jeopardy. 1 don't care to
take any chances. 1 might make myself
liable for false imprisonment and becom
jielled to pay damages.
"The placing of the warrant with me
puts me in a peculiar position. Snook &
Church are the attorneys for Daniels in
this matter and they are my attorneys.
But that does not matter. I am going to
abide by he decision of the District At
torney."
Sheriff Rogers, on receipt of the war
rant, appealed to District Attorney Allen
for an opinion. The Sheriff said he would
not undertake to act on such a question
able case without having been first ad
vised-

OAKLAND, Feb. 14.â Court Commis

commanding the Sheriff to arrest G. B.
Daniels, editor of the Oakland Enquirer,
for contempt of court. The order was
placed in the hands of Sheriff Rogers to
serve, but that officer refuses to act until
Ue has been officially advised by District
Attorney Allen that the proceeding is reg
ular and that the arrest can be made
without liability to himself or his bonds
men- 'Allen set himself to the task of
looking up the law on the questions in
volved, and as he was still searching at
the end of office hours, declared that it
would be some lime to-morrow before he
gives out his decision.
The proceeding was to have gone on
before the Court Commissioner this morn

ney Ach sent word that he was 111 ana
could not appear. Ach, however, sent the
warrant for Daniels' arrest, which he had
spent the night in preparing. The Court
commissioner took a couple of hours to
examine the papers to see If they were
correct ana then turned them over to
under Sheriff Harlow.
The order lor the arrest cf Daniels con
tains a review of. the proceedings leading
up to the judgment of contempt and re
quires the Sheriff to apprehend the de

until 1 o'clock to-morrow afternoon, when

This morning Attorney B. A. Herrlngton
obtained a writ of habeas corpus return
able at 2 o'clock this afternoon. The at
torney alleged that the young man was
deprived of his liberty without a war
rant. Sheriff Langford produced a signed
statement from Yesces to the effect that
the prisoner had not employed Herring
ton to represent him and that the peti
tion was presented without his knowledge
or consent. Herrington, however, claim
ed that friends of the young man hai
employed him.
Judge Lorigan granted the writ on tha
ground that Yesces was held without duo
process, and ordered Yesces released. His
liberty was of but a few seconds* dura

him as a witness. Yesces' bond was placed
at $5000, in default of which he was re

FRESNO. Feb. 14.â Judge Church in the
Superior Court to-day in the case of the

city ordinance against nickel-In- the-s lot

holds that the machines constitute a
banking game and come under the State
law. On that account the city has no
power to legislate against them. The at
titude of the cigar men is as yet un
known. If they put the machines into
use they probably will be proceeded
against under the State law against
banking games.

he had been ignorantly ridiculed for the
suggestion of "casual peace negotiations
in some wayside inn." but he thought the
innocent mission of Dr. Kuyper, the
Dutch Premier, bore a fairly close anal
ogy to such a course.
The speaker said he thought the reply
of Lord Lansdowne. the Under Secretary
for Foreign Affairs, to Dr. Kuyper was
fitting and dignified, but he thought the
Government had acted Â¦wrongly In declin
ing to reckon with the Boer delegates in
Europe and allow them to send a deputa
tion to South Africa.
"The trouble with the Government,"
said Lord Rosebery, "is that they are
always thinking of the present. X try
to think of the future, Â¦ when Boer and
Briton will have to live together In South
Africa." . Â¦Â«.} .
I am not prepared at any tlmÂ« or under any
circumstances to - grant them an independent
Parliament. No sane Derson would ever con
sent to handing over the destinies of Ireland,
situated in the very heart of the empire, to a
Parliament controlled by those who have ex
pressed the earnest wish that we might be
overthrown In battle. The Irish question is too
large for any one party. It will need the en
ergy and"- the patriotism of both. great parties
to deal therewith.. \ These are my personal sen
timents, but I wish to make them perfectly
clear on returning., to public life. . ' â¢
LIVERPOOL, Feb. 14.â Lord Roseberry
received a ' tremendous ovation at the
great 'f Liberal demonstration here this
evening. His lengthy speech, the princi
pal one of the evening, was attentively
received and heartily applauded. He
failed to throw any fresh light on the
war situation, but he strongly emphasized
his hostility to the Irish party and his
desire to utterlyialienate.it from the Lib
eral camp.
During, his remarks Lord Rosebery said
that the greatest change in heart and
head undergone during his five years' ab
sence from public life was In regard to
the Irish problem. Gladstone's bills were
dead and buried, though that statement
cast no reflection on the great statesman
wha originated them. The Irish party had
now indignantly repudiated any connec-,
tlon: with -the Liberal party,, and he be
lieved they had acted wisely. It was
both to their interests and to those of
the Liberal party. The Irish-leaders had
played their full hand. They, had de
manded an independent Parliament in
Dublin, and thereupon he had cried
"Halt!" . This remark was greeted '..with
applause. .Continuing 1 , Lord Rosebery said:
Some months ago Brockway came into
prominence by reporting- to the police that
he "and a '.woman .who*, were, at Ingleside
together had been robbed of jewelry to
the amount of $3000. The story created a
sensation at the time, and it is mooted
that there is a connection between the
Ingleside episode and the proceedings of
yesterday. * ~
Stone refused to say a word in expla
nation, of the mysterious proceedings and
also refused to give bis address; but last
evening he was located at 256 Turk street.
With profuse apologies Stone declined
to say anything for publication, or in ex
planation, but promises in a few days to
have something interesting to relate. In
the meantime the Sheriff is making a
vigorous effort to find the missing Brpck
way. If he Is discovered and brought
before the courts he will not be released
unless he finds bail to the sum of $3000.
That much Attorney Maguire admitted.
An indemnity bond of $500 was given by
the complainant's attorneys before the
action was taken.
When Mr. and Mrs. Stone entered the
lawyer's offices on the fourth floor of the
Parrott building they were in custody of
Deputy Sheriff Hollingsworth. When they
left the offices in the evening they were
free to return to their home.
Deputy Sheriff Holllngsworth during the
afternoon left the Stjnes in charge of
Deputy Sheriff Timothy J. Murpky while
he went In search of the missing Brock
way, and from information given, it was
thought he would soon have his man.
The nature of the examination held by
the attorneys for the plaintiff was not re
vealed, but it resulted in those gentlemen
releasing the Stones and a vigorous search
was at once instituted with a view of cap
turlag Brockway.
The mystery surrounding the whole pro
ceeding was enhanced when Attorney Ma
guire . and hfe colleague refused, with
many regrets, to account for the hearing
of the case in their private offices or to
say why the Stcnes were released." On
being asked for the plaintiff's address
there was a. similar restraint and abso
lute refusal. The most that the attorneys
would say was that they were taking the
depositions of Mr. and Mrs. Stone.
A courteous but firm determination not
to answer followed when Inquiry was
made as to the identity of L. M. Kittrell,
or Ketrell.
A suit was filed yesterday In the Supe
rior Court by L. M. Klttrell to recover
$3500 from Charles B. Brockway. A. \V.
A Stone, a clairvoyant, and Mrs. A. W.
a! Stone. It Is alleged that $3000 v of the
amount claimed Is represented In dia
monds wrongfully taken from one L. J.
Harris, for whom Kittrell was assignee.
There was also a further charge of fraud
ulent concealment of property.
The defendants, A. "\V. A. Stone and
Mrs. S'.one were arrested yesterday and
taken to the offices of former Judge
James G. Maguire and Attorney E. T.
Barrett, who represented the plaintiff. .
Klttrell charges that November 8 last
Brockway, for whom the Sheriff Is
searching, and Stone- forced Harris to give
up possession of six diamond rings and a
gold watch set in diamonds. In fear that
the defendants might leave the city. Dep
uty Sheriff Holllngsworth was armed with
warrants for their arrest, lssed by Judge
Cook- Later Judge Kerrigan issued an
order by which the attorneys for the
plaintiff were empowered to release the
Stones from custody if they so desired.
Nearly the whole of yesterday the Stones
were under examination in the private
offices of Attorneys Magulre and Bar

there was no .objection to her leaving
South Africa, but she would not be al
lowed to reside In Cape Colony.

An Ideal
Medicine.
A New Discovery Which Cures
All Forms of Catarrh.
- The. tablet is the Ideal form In which to ad-
minister medicine, but until recently no suc-
cessful catarrh tablet had ever been attempted.
There is now, however, an excellent and pala-
table remedy for catarrh In tablet form, known
Â£3 Stuart's Catarrh Tablets and sold by drug-
gists, composed of the most recent discoveries
In medicine for cure of catarrh, and results
from their use have been highly gratifying.
The j old time â¢ treatment of catarrh was la -
the form of inhalers, washes, douches, Â«prayÂ».
etc. Later on internal remedies were used
with - greater success; but being In liquid or
powder form were Inconvenient to use and like -
all * medicines In .liqnld or powder form losÂ»
their medicinal properties when opened or ex-
posed to the air.
Â¦ Stuart's Catarrh Tablets contain highly con-
centrated antiseptics. Red Gum. Blood Root,
etc., which kill the catarrh germs In the- blood
and mucous membrane, and in this respect arc
. strictly, scientific and modern, because all au-
thorities are now agreed that catarrh is a con-
stitutional blood disease, and local application*
can have only a transitory effect.
The use of Inhalers, douches and sprays Is a
nuisance and inconvenience and can In no wise
compare favorably with the same antislptica
given in tablet form Internally, where they caa '
reach the stomach and blood and kill catarrh
germs right where they are produced.
A prominent lawyer and public speaker of
Pittsburg says: "I have been troubled with
catarrh of the head and throat for twelvÂ»
years. In this climate it seems impossible to
get rid of it. . The continual dropping of mucus
from tbe nose Into the throat caused irritation
and hoarseness, seriously interfering -with my
public speaking. It took me an hour or more
of coughing, gagging, expectorating and sneez-
ing every . morning before I could settle down
to work, and this condition gradually brought
on catarrh of stomach, causing loss of appe-
tite, â¢ poor digestion and a foul breath, which
annoyed me exceedingly. My physician - ad-
vised me to try Stuart's Catarrh Tablets and
I took them for two months and was aston-
ished to . find how quickly they cleared - my
head, throat and stomach, and I have no hesi-
tation in recommending them. â¢ They are not
only pleasant. to take, but they seem to get at
the. very root of -the trouble, because sine*
using them I have had no trace of catarrh."
Druggists sell Stuart's Catarrh Tablets at SO
cents for full sized package.
They can be carried in. the pocket and used
any time and as often as desired, since they.

George D. Gillespie was found guilty of
manslaughter last evening by a jury that
had listened- for some days to the testi
mony in the trial of the defendant for the
murder of William D. Grlffln oh the night
of August 20 of last year. The jury was
cut four hours. Sentence will be pro
nounced this morning.
Gillespie, who Is well known in labor
circles, shot and killed Griflln in the lat
ter's room at the lodging-house at 119
Ninth street, of which place Gillespie was
the proprietor. According to the prosecu
tion, the defendant was called by his wife
to quell a disturbance in Grifl&n's room,-,
where Griflln was abusing his wife. The
prosecution claimed that Gillespie being
a man of most violent temper went to his
office, secured his revolver and returned
to Griflin's room and then .resumed the
quarrel, shooting Grlfiln without sufficient
provocation.
At the morning session of the trial the
prosecution t sought to introduce photo
graphs of Griffin in order to compare his
physique with that of the defendant, Gil
lespie, but Judge Cook sustained an ob
jection made by, the attorneys for the de
fense. â¢-â¢ .
Fred Heywood was placed on the stand
by the prosecution for- the purpose of
showing that Gillespie was a man of vio
lent temper and that the witness had been
beaten by him In a quarrel. The, court
again sustained an objection of the de
fense to that line of examination.
Gillespie and his wife were next re
called and testified that after. Griffin was
shot no weapon was found in Griffin's
room. i
, The prosecution and the defense waived
a written charge to tne Jury and the
closing arguments were made.
Porter Ashe for the prosecution argued
that Gillespie was not Justified in killing
Griffin and that there was no evidence to
show that he had been threatened by tho
man he killed. Counsel characterized the
defense as one that could â¢ not be be
lieved, and declared that Gillespie had
shot Griflln while the latter was seated in
a chair.
Attorney Roy for the defense argued
that Grifiln had threatened the life of
Gillespie and had also flourished a carv
ing knife.- The defendant then procured
his pistol and returned, to the room. Rdy
claimed that the quarrel was then re
sumed and that Gillespie pointed his pis
tol at Griffin to intimidate him, when he
made a motion to draw a revolver. Tho
defendant, being unfamiliar with a double
action revolver, had shot Griflln without
any intention of doing so.
Attorney Farrell made the closing ar
gument for the defense and. based it on
the . lines -' of . accidental homicide. He
claimed that the actions of the defendant
Immediately after the shooting were
those of an innocent man. and asked for
a verdict of acquittal at the hands of
'the jury.
Special Counsel Black closed the case
for the prosecution. He made a brilliant
address to the jury and ridiculed the de
fense offered by Gillespie. Black argued
that the evidence of Gillespie showednhat
he had gone to his desk to secure a pis
tol; that he had returned to Griffin's room
and resumed the quarrel and had shot
Griffin deliberately.
â¢Judge Carroll Cook- delivered -a long
charge to the jury. He instructed ' the
jurors as, to the legal definitions of mur
der of various degrees and also as to the
law of justifiable homicide and self-de
fense. . v
The case was given to the Jury at 4:20

could do so ' much Â¦ for the State /in pro

and he hoped that '.the work of Â¦; the con

.A' resolution advocating the creation of

much to do that they seldom find time to study

Â¦which acts in co-operation" with the- State 'has
â¢been adopted by most of the States.', Eighteen'
States have established â¢ boards | of charities ) and
corrections. No new Idea has been- advanced
by. any State not having: such a' board. : It
co-ordinates all these institutions ' and .. binds
them together. I hold: that a bad system' well'
administered is far better than a good: system!
badly administered.' The question of the : per
sonal; politics of the superintendent of a State
institution is nobody's â¢ business. -As* long as

He said he was walking along Kearny
street and was accosted at the corner of
Sutter street by a stranger who asked him
if he could drive a cab. He replied in the
affirmative and climbed up on the driver's
seat, while the stranger, he says, got In
side. He drove the cab down Kearny to
California, where It was struck by a Cali
fornia-street car and badly, wrecked. Mc-
Donald was thrown to the ground, but an
investigation failed to show that-any
body was inside the cab.
It is supposed by the police that Mc-
Dcnald. who had been drinking,' drove off
the vehicle as a frolic. It Is not thought
that the disastrous joke will have a fatal
termination. The driver of the cab missed
his vehicle and telephoned its loss to
police headquarters. It was restored " to
him later in a badly battered condition

Jury Finds the Killing
ofW.D. Griffin Was
Manslaughter.
G. D. GILLESPIE
IS CONVICTED
Captain Seymour obtained a description
of a man in Oakland who is said to resem
ble Bennett, and Mr. Krone spent yester
day afternoon across the bay in company
with a detective looking for the suspect.
It was learned that he had come to San
Francisco, but he had not been located
last night. No great importance Is at
tached to this clew, but In accordance
with the policy adopted in the "beginning
every bit of information that appears of
the least value Is sedulously Investigated.
Hugh Grant, the police court lawyer
Â¦who has figured prominently in the case,
and whose connection with it has been
thoroughly Investigated, was before Cap
tain Seymour again yesterday. He said
he had come to explain the matter of
having assaulted a woman in his offices
In the Emma Spreckels building, accounts
of which have been published in the pa
pers. He admitted the facts, and said
thaf the woman was his mistress with
whom he frequently quarreled, and that
he frequently chastised her physically,
but without doing her any serious injury
Conductor Fairweather of the Sutter
street line, â¢who is well acquainted with
Grant, told Captain Seymour that he had
let the lawyer off his car in front of the
Sutter-street house where the body was
found, but was unable to say that he had
ever seen G.-ant going into or coming from
the house. As Grant lived only two blocks
from the house in question, he might
easily have been carried beyond his desti
nation by accident. The police admit
that they have no evidence connecting
Grant with the murder of Nora. Fuller.
A waiter from the Cafe Royal, on noto
riety bent, called on Captain Seymour
yesierday and said be had been ap
proached by somebody, of whom he gave
a hazy description, and asked to carry a
rote to Nora Fuller. As this incident was
alleged to have occurred only a few days
ago, the waiter and his story were dis
missed as absurd. --â¢-" .-Â¦Â¦
At first he was somewhat struck by the
resemblance it bore to the man who gave
his name as Bennett, but after a careful
study of the features he decided It could
not be the much-sought murderer. He
said the face was coarser and the nostrils
too t. ide to correspond with Bennett. Be
sides the suicide had lost his upper front
teeth, while Bennett has a full set of ex
cellent teeth, which are well . taken
care of.'
As day follow/ day without any devel
opments in the Fuller murder case that
promise in any way to solve the hideous
mystery of Unit inexplicable crime, the
police and public bt^iu to doubt that. the
perpetrator will ever be made to answer
before a hurran tribunal. Yesterday pre
sented absolutely no new feature or sug
gestion, and the old matters connected
with the murder were threshed over, un
a.vailingly. Apparently everything con
cerning the criminal and the crime that Is
known to any lawabiding and innocent
citizen cf the community has been dl
vuiged to thÂ« poilcf, out the solution of
the puzzle is as remote as it was when
the body ot Nora. Fuller was first found.
Captain Seymour franKly admits that only
unexpected aevelopments In the case offer
any char.ee of tracing down the criminal.
Some hope was raised yesterday that the
tangled titfcin of crime might be unraveled
parUaliy by an examination of the records
of the Morgue. It was discovered that
the body ot an unknown man who had
committed- suicide In Golden Gate Park
had been brought to the Morgue on Jan
uary lii, which answered in every detail of
height, dress, general appearance and
features to the description given of Ben
nett by J. \V. Krone, proprietor of the
Popular restaurant, where the murderer
arranged to meet his victim. I Mr. Krone
accompanied a Call reporter to the
Morgue and viewed the photograph of the
euicide.
The.' meeting was called to order by
President Horace Davis. On the stage
were Mayor Schmitz, C. A. Murdock and
Samuel G. Smith of St. Paul, Minn. The
Mayor was introduced amid applause. He
said:

Moran after his arrest and his final ad
mission that he and .three other, con
spirators went out to the Mission on the
evening of October 11 to "get a scab."
He concluded , by demanding that, justice
should be meted out to the defendant for
his participation in the , diabolical crime.
â¢Attorney .George - D. Collins -made a
lengthy argument for . the defense. He
pointed out the Â¦ discrepancy between the
witnesses "for the prosecution, Piatt de
claring that Moran wielded the club that
felled Rice to the ground, while Keaveny
declared that * the .man who wielded the
club rode on the car in front of him and
attacked Rice as soon as he stepped from
the car, contradicting Piatt. Then there
was-the evidence of the boy Arthur
Cleve, who saw Moran standing beside
Buckley when Buckley fired the shots
into Rice's prostrate form,. but he did not
see Moran use a club.- He claimed that
the prosecution did not try. to prove that
Moran was the man who wielded the
club. /; ' . â¢ _.
-He argued that no conspiracy to mur
der had been proved, which was essential
before a- verdict could be brought against
the defendant." All that was shown was
that' the men met in a saloon and some
one said they were going out to the Mis
sion to "get a scab," but that did not
show .-that murder . was intended. He
urged the jury: as reasonable men to
acault the defendant. Â«
Assistant District Attorney Alford
made the closing argument and replied
to the arguments of Collins. , ;
The jury then retired* and reached the
foregoing verdict. . Â¦

Hall last night,' under the'auspices of the
headquarters staff and officers of ! tHe

Some- of : his tricks, with a keen edge
sword, were cleverly executed. " The
members of the committees having the
entertainment in hand, who were in evi
dence during the, evening in their natty
khaki uniforms, were: Major Frederick
