SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, JANUARY; '6, 1902.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
The San Francisco Call.It Is evident that some who have been
posing as survivors , of the Walla Walla
wreck are impostors. Some have given
in their names to secure a free trip to San
Francisco, while otters were probably
looking for notoriety. The number of
those who landed safely on the shores of
this county is 102. Of these the Dispatch
brought sixty-four and the tug Ranger
picked up a^ boat containing fourteen.
Seven came ashore at Trinidad. At Big
Lagoon ten landed safely and at Stond
Lagoon the seven sailors beached their
boat. The latest list, excluding the six
picked up by the Nome City, shows IDS
survivors. This indicates there are im
postors. The steamship list is not cor
rect. New names are coming to light and
names in the list are found to be incor
rect. Two theatrical men whose names
are V. J. Fara and H. C. "Wilson were
sold tickets under the names of Jones and
Brown. Another survivor who gives hl3
name as J. F. Fainlle la not on the sail
ing list.
The committees from the City Council
and the Chamber of Commerce estimate
their expenditures in outfitting > the sur
vivors to have been $830. Another $100 waa
spent in patroling the beach from Eel
River to Big Laloon. It is estimated that
$500 more will be needed to patrol the
beaches and bury the dead that come to
shore.
The seven sailors who selfishly occupied
one boat when there were other boats
carrying fourteen have- met with a flat
reception here. There are many who feel
very- bitter toward them, while others ara
disposed to give some credit to their story
and give them the benefit of the doubt.
The members of this party do not tell
straightforward storiea. Their tales ara
full of contradictions.
EUREKA, Jan. 5.â The beach la
the vicinity of the Stone and Big
lagoons is being carefully pa
trolled to secure the bodies of
. the unfortunates that reach
land. It la thought that the ma
jority of the bodies that come
ashore will be washed in somewhere in
the vicinity of Trinidad, about sixty
miles north of the scene of the collision,
as â¢ a strong current sets In toward the
north. This accounts for the fact that
three boats full of survivors, the only ones
that escaped who were not picked up by
the Dispatch, tug Ranger or Nome City,
came to shore at this point. The raft
containing Peter Xilson, first mate; F.
Lupp, second mate; C. Brown, fourth
mate; J. Schiel, pantryman; Ed Murrillo,
third cook, and Henry Erickson, passen
ger, was found by the Xome City near
Trinidad. The peopls in the southern end
of the county are also keeping a look
out. The Centerville beach near Ferndala
is bein? carefully watched.

Sad Scenes Are Witnessed at the Wharf When the Bruised and Careworn
Passengers and Mariners Who Were in the Terrible Ocean
Catastrophe Meet jfFheir Relatives and Friends.
/-^Â» ORROW and joy were mingled at
C ' Broadway wharf yesterday morn
"^^^^- ing, when the steamship Pomona
tied up to the dock- and landed a
JL 1 throng â¢ of weather-beaten survi
"'- vors of the Walla Walla disaster;
. Down the -gangplank filed the
wan and weary unfortunates, some of
them maimed and bruised and others
nerve-shattered and tottering from; the
effects of their terrible experience.
On the dock wives .and \ children and
mothers and fathers; surged, around the
gangway to embrace \ their loved ones.
The grief-stricken relatives of those who
went down' to their death in the wreck
were there also with the overjoyed fami
lies of those ,who survived. It was : a
pathetic scene and there were many inci
dents that compelled the . flow of tears.
Sergeant of Police Mahdney and a platoon
of patrolmen' were on hand to ; keep the
crowd moving, : and ' as fast as possible
carriages were driven up to the gangplank
to carry away those who had suffered
severe iniurles. "
The Pomona left Eureka Saturday, aft
ernoon at 2 o'clock ' and 'Â¦- made the run
down in., eighteen -. hours. Â¦ Outside the
Heads the steamer was met by the tug
Liberty, with Captain Wallace, A. A.
Waters and other members of the Pacific
Coast Steamship" Company, who went out
to offer' what aid they 'could 'to the sur
vivors. Every, little- attention -.was paid
them on their arrival. . The steamship
company had several physicians on ; hand
to succor the injured., /
James Robishote, a youth who lives at
1819 Vallejo street, was taken to his home
in a~ serious condition as a result of long
exposure and lack of water and- food.' He
was laid out downstairs in ' the room ol
one of the officers of. the Pomona arid the
physician who was \ working over him
said that It was not improbable that
young Robishote would die.
In the next room J.- A. Sell, another of
the Walla , Walla's passengers,- was suf
fering from a deep gashMn his head. and

Dr.' J. Â¦ F. Â¦ Burns,'. who came up from San
Jose to attend her. > .
William Goldsmith, â¢ one ; of r the >Walla
Walla's firemen, hobbled down the ganc
plank on crutches. Both his feet and
legs were badly crushed by wreckage
after the steamer went down. He was
carried under, the waves by the -suction
and the churning waters threw all sorts
of wreckage. against his limbs with force
enough to injure Â¦ him seriously. Gold
smith was picked up by several compan
ions and hauled aboard a liferaft, where
he went through another terrible : ordeal.
: There were two more unfortunates that
were so seriously ill and injured that they
could not be removed from Big Lagoon,
where they landed Saturday on one of the
liferafts. Charles Gleason, believed .to
be the - well-known boxer recently re
turned from Alaska, was one of the two
who were not brought : down on the : Po
mona, It is. reported that Gleason has
a small chance of. recovery, and his com
panion, W. H. Weaver, is . also seriously

SURVIVORS OF THE SEA DISASTER
RETURN TO THIS CITY ON POMONA
Mayor Johnson spoke briefly. He said
he was' In full sympathy with the intent
of the meeting and expressed similar sen
timents to those given by Bryan, . savins
the .English people generally were opposed
to the war. â¢'Â¦<;
The resolutions' passed will be sent to
President Roosevelt. They call attention
to the denunciation by. President McKin
ley of the system of Â« reconcentration
camps and a. quotation from the Man
chester (England) Guardian of September
last, which states that, a degree of â¢ suf
fering â¢ and Â¦ death exists in - these camps
without a parallel in history. .
President Roosevelt â¢ is asked to con
tinue the efforts of Â¦ his . predecessor to
bring to ah end the horrors of concentra
tion . camps and a warfare which "by its
unexampled ferocity and enormous 'cost
of life and treasure has astonished the
civilized world.". He is also asked to en
force the treaty of Washington, May 8,
1S71, denying the vesseis operating under
British authority \ opportunity , for.*- tbe
augmentation of supplies, of war from the
United States.
Sad will be that, day, fallen will be the star'
of our destiny, if the time ever comes when
strugsliT.g freemen feel that they cannot' look
upon the people of these States for sympathy.
Bryan, who said* that he was in entire
sympathy with the intent of the meeting
eulogized the fighting ' South 'African
farmers and urged that they continue the
struggle. He further said that he consid
ered it a compliment that the Boers
looked to the United States for aid and
sympathy In their: struggle, and he con-
Fldered it a disgrace that no official ex
pression of sympathy had yet been. made
by this Government.
When the formal- speeches were con
cluded Messrs. Bryan and Johnson ; were
called upon to address the audience.
Bryan spoke for about five minutes, dur
ing which time he said in part: A
The meeting continued for . four hours,
the principal address being delivered by
Hon. John J. Lentz. .
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Jan. 5.â Four
thousand people attended a pro-Boer
meeting In Garrey's Armory this after
noon. There was enthusiastic applause
for every expression of sympathy and en
couragement for the struggling Boers. An
unexpected occurrence in the meeting was
the appearance of Hon. W. J. Bryan, who
was In this city for the day as the guest
of Mayor Johnson. When the committee
in charge of the meeting learned that the
Democratic leader was in the city an in
vitation was sent to him and the Mayor
to attend and address the gathering. Both
gentlemen accepted and when, toward the
close of other speeches, Bryan and John- 1
son entered the hall the audience rose en
masse and repeatedly shouted the names
of '"Bryan" and "Johnson" an'd ' greeted
them with hurrahs and handclapplngs.
Upon the stage were seven native Boers,
who had been in some of the early "con

"All during the. first day we rowed to
ward the Mendocino light, but made very
little headway. Strange to say, on the
first day no one thought of eating, at
least none spoke of it. On the first day
we sighted the Dispatch, but could not
make her see us. We made .a flag out of
a red shawl belonging to Miss Peters and
used it to signal with, but we could not
succeed in attracting the attention of the
Dispatch.
â¢ "During the night we suffered very
much from the intense cold and also from
hunger and thirst. We Â¦were so hungry
that one orange was divided among the
fourteen of us. I don't know of anything
that ever tasted so good to me as that
little piece of orange. About half past
10 o'clock the next day we were sighted by
the Ranger. When we were . picked up
we -were so exhausted from the intense
cold, hunger and thirst that we could not
stand up. We actually fell when we were
taken aboard the Ranger.
, "The people of Eureka showed us the
greatest kindness. They supplied us with
whatever we needed.: - No care was too
great nor. nothing too good for us. We
certainly passed through - an experience
that I, for one, 1 will never forget."
, "There were fourteen people in the boat
when my husband climbed in. Not more
than twenty minutes after we rowed
away from the side of the Walla Walla
she disappeared from sight. One of the
crew of the. Walla Walla assumed charge
of- our boat and did excellent work.- We
called him our captain and my husband
was his first officer.
"When the collision occurred, the crash
awoke my husband. He immediately
went on deck to see what had happened.
He soon returned and told me to dress as
quickly as possible. I only had time to
put on my skirt, but my husband threw
his overcoat about me as we went to his
mother's stateroom to awaken her.
"I think that Mrs. Stream and myself
were the last women to ' leave the boat.
During the whole accident my husband
acted with the greatest presence of mind.
He assisted me, his mother and Miss Pe
ters into the small boat and would not
leave the sinking. ship until he was sure
that all the women had been taken off.
Mrs. T. W. Stream was profuse in her
praise of her young husband's bravery
during the trying time when the Walla
Walla was settling in the water. In
speaking of the wreck she said:
Mrs. A. F. Stream, mother of the young
groom, is very ill from the hardships
which she endured during the thirty hours
She was adrift In the small boat When
she arrived in this city yesterday she
was completely exhausted and .was forced

his mother returned with her on the Po

Woman" Encourages' the Men.
The sight of the sun rising in crimson
glory in the east encouraged the half
drowned castaways to renew their flag
ging efforts,, and the hope of being res
cued, which had almost died in their
breasts, was revived.
"One man came to our raft and held on
for a time, and when he said he was too
exhausted to hold on any longer we
dragged . him aboard. .He suffered horri
oiy from the cold and exposure."
The struggle for life was now begun.
It was very dark and those huddled on
the raft clung to the slats to keep them
selves from being washed overboard in
the heavy swell which prevailed. Daly
states that many of his comrades in mis
fortune were thinly clad and their suffer
ings grew momentarily. The instincts of
gallantry were not ignored in the hour
of their supreme misfortune and the men
placed Mrs. Williams in their midst and
sought to protect her as far as possible
from the chill wind that lashed the waves
to gTeater fury. Mrs. Williams wore her
night gown, she having been unable to
dress in the excitement following the col
lision. But, drenched as the wrecked
passengers were, the question of cloth
ing was of little moment. The main prob
lem was how to keep from being. washed
away into the swirling waters which like
ravening beasts of prey threatened them.
The men encouraged one another to be
brave and never let go their hold; but the
woman sat silent, not a word escaping
her until dawn.

Daly related the story of his sufferings
to a Call reporter "yesterday/ ; He Is only
a and says he will never forget his ex
perience if he lives to be 'a.- thou
sand years old. He had been on
a. visit to friends in San Fran
cisco and was on his way home. He"
was lying on his bunk, unable to sleep,
when the crash which was to usher so
many to eternity came. He immediately
rose and dressed himself, wondering tne
while what had happened. On the deck
he inQuired of a mghtened passenger
what was wrong and was informed tnat
there had been a collision and that the
\\alla Walla was" sinking. He made out
the lines of the French bark which had
caused the damage just as she was dis
appearing in the gloom westward.
â¢The snip began to sink rapidly after
the collision," said Daly. "Naturally
every one was looking out for himself,
fortunately the officers were cool and
under the orders of Captain Hall the con
tusion gave way to order, in which ex
cellent work was done. I managed to
secure a place on a life raft just before
the vessel went down. There were eight
pople on our raft, including one woman,
Mrs. Williams of Victoria, and our com
bined weight sent the raft down so that
we sat waist deep in water. We saw
many people swimming in the water
about us after the ship made her fatal
plunge, but how the most of them fared
1 hare no means of knowing.
and seven others, who with him
clung to a life raft for eleven hours,
every minute of which was a struggle
against death in the waves, which dashed
over them ceaselessly from, the time . they
embarked upon the frail structure until
they were picked up by the Dispatch and
conveyed to Eureka.
THE disaster that befell the Walla
Walla has furnished many thrill
ing stories of hardship and suf
fering-, but none endured greater
, torments than F. W. Daly, a
drug clerk "of Everett, Wash.,
i ceived came a cold wind that froze us to
the marrow. We looked for a sail, but
for several hours saw none. We could
see nothing: but the sea rushing down
upon us as if it wanted to swallow us
alive. One man , wanted to jump over
board, and we had difficulty in restrain
ing: him. About 10 o/ clock we saw -a sail,
but it was far off and our hails could not
reach it, I suppose. Then we saw two
other sails, but we were so low down in
the water that even the most" careful
lookout on a ship could scarcely see us.
About 2 o'clock we saw smoke and pretty,
soon- the Dispatch came in. sight. Â¦ "Ah,
how we did .shout and clasp, each: other's
hands when we found her bearing down
upon us! I think that moment repaid the
most of us for the terrible sufferings we
had unedrgone, sitting waist deep on a
wave-washed raft for nearly twelve
hours. Many of our party were so ex
hausted they could hardly keep from cry
ing like children. Mrs. Williams was the
bravest of all of us, I believe..- She talked
to us encouragingly and in every 'way
showed that she was made of the right
stun*. The poor woman must have â¢ suf
fered untold agony, as her pinched face
and deep-set . eyes indicated, Â¦ but to hear
her talk you would have thought we' were
on a pleasure trip. When we were taken
aboard the Dispatch we were nearly done
for, as you may- imagine, 1 - but :Â¦ certainly
there weren't eight more thankful people
than ourselves on the face of the globe.
It was an awful experience for all of us,'
and I sincerely, hope -I may never pass
through the like again."

TELL OF AGONY
AND SUFFERING
O'Leary speaks in the highest terms of
the conduct of Captain Hall and the of
ficers under his charge for their conduct
during the trying time. O'Leary will make
a report of his experiences to the Pacific
Coast BU:amship Company to-day.
"The pÂ«Â»ple of Trinidad took us to the
hotel anc provided for us as best they
could. Those who came in on the boat
were a baker named Marshall, two pas
sengers named W. L. Smith and More
house, Billy Sheehan and McClellan, fire
men; Chiirlee Brown, the third assistant
engineer, and myself. As soon as possible
we were sent on to Arcata. When we
reached liiere a committee of citizens
came to meet us and wanted to turn the
entire town over to us. They offered us
money ar d everything else, and then sent
mb on to Eureka, where the same recep
tion was given us. They could not do too
much for us. They fitted us with clothes
and ever:rthing- else, placing the entire
contents of a big store at our disposal.
Is one of tis had any money, but the com
mittee hsd plenty to give to every man.
I want t> take off my hat to the people
cf ArcaUt. and Eureka for the treatment
given us."
"Third Assistant Engineer Brown took
charge, but he left the sailing of the boat
to me, and I put in for Trinidad. We
picked up the buoy off Trinidad light
about midnight of Thursday. Some of the
passengers wanted to go for the shore at
once, but Brown and I determined to lay
to till daylight. We made fast to the
buoy and rigged a cover for the boat out
of the blanket. We laid together on the
thwarts is close as we could until morn-
Ing.
, "At 7 o'clock Friday morning we start
ed for the beach. Brown steered and I
took the oars. As we neared the shore a
man from the stable showed us the
easiest way to get to the beach. We made
the landing all right and pulled the boat
Â¦up on the beach. "We were twenty-nine
hours oui- For four hours we were cap
sized, and for four hours we were tied up
at the buoy. All we had to eat was some
crackers, the water keg having broken
loose from its lashings.
Â¦7"igil in Frail Craft.
"One o:f the passengers grabbed me by
the 'dicer' I wore when we went over
either the second or third time. As it was
everybody for himself, I ducked and went
under the boat. He let go and I came up
on the other side. I managed then to get
the boat lighted, and stood on the thwarts
telling the others to balance the boat. I
began to bail it out with my 'dicer,' and
you otrgfct to see that hat when I got
through. It had no shape at all.
"The next man lost was one of the pas
sengers. He wore a black suit and was a
6ufferer from rheumatism. He went down
quickly. The boat was again righted and
the passÂ«!ngers clung to the sides. Over
went the boat again, and two more pas
6engers jjave up their hold on the keel
end dropped into the sea. One of these
managed to grab the bow of the boat. He
was a strong, stout, line-looking fellow
End made a hard fight for life, but he
could not stand the buffeting of the
waves.
â¢â¢Then i.here was a passenger wearing a
preen sweater who made another hard
fight. Il<: clung on for an hour or more,
but finally gave up the struggle and went
down. Wilson, the quartermaster, was
praying- all the time, and although he
made a desperate attempt to swim, en
cumbered as he was with his oilskins and
rubber boots, he at last went down.
"At 11:51 o'clock on Thursdayâ that Is
the time by all the watches that stoppedâ
Â¦when we were about fifteen miles from
chore, with Wilson steering the boat, he
turned her into the wind and a sea caught
us on the after-quarter. The boat turned
over and then righted herself. All clung
to her, and we were again thrown oft.
The first man who was lost dropped right
off the keel. Two men with life-preservers
on were caught under the boat and died
from Buflocation underneath her airtight
compartments. Bartel was the first man
drowned. His life-preserver suffocated

"When the collision occurred I was
asleep, a.ad knew nothing of what hap
pened prior to the time I was awakened.
I heard the crash and ran to my station
at boat 7. I heard the captain give orders
to man f.ie boats. I got my oilskins and
rubber boots and some, old clothes. I
found boat 7 manned and then started
across the deck for No. 6. I cut the lash-
Ings of tHis boat and got 'in with twelve
others. 2'ohn Wilson, quartermaster, was
in charge:.
"Captain Hall gave orders for all boats
to start .lor the French bark, which was
to leewaxd. We chased the French bark
for four miles; we hallooed at her, but
could not get any response. We saw her

Â¦we all decided to start for land. < We

Ole Johnson, one of the crew of the
Walla Walla, was the man who picked
up Captain Hall while he was struggling
in the water after the Ill-fated steamer
went to the bottom. He said:
"Our raft was close to the ship when
she sank. I saw Captain Hall and the
first officer struggling In the sea, and I
tried to get them both aboard, but only
succeeded in pulling Captain Hall on the
raft. He had been injured in the terrible
swirl of the ocean caused by the suction
of the ship as she sank, but while he was
weak and in pain for the time being he
was very cool.
"After Captain Hall got aboard he or
dered us to go around the scene and look
for stragglers. We had a hard experience
and suffered a little from cold before be
ing picked up. but the old seadogs on our
raft did not mind that very much. All the
captain's thoughts were for the poor dev
ils who might not have succeeded in get
ting off the steamer. After eleven hours
of tossing about on the sea we were
picked up by the Dispatch."

was accompanying her on her
journey to her home in Seattle, and when
the crash came the youth bravely refused
to go in' a lifeboat and gave his mother
his . place there instead. There Â¦ was only
one place left in the . lifeboat when the
orders came to, abandon ship. The offi
cer^ in charge /ordered Mrs.. MejWen

room - for her son she - refused", at . first . to
go. The little fellow bravely advised her
to obey orders, saying that he would take
care of himself. And he did. He;found
a place on one of the life rafts and met
his nearly grief-crazed mother on the
shore.. Mrs. Meydenbauer said: . \
"It was a trying experience with me,
suffering untold physical torture from the
cold and exposure and mental pangs by
not knowing whether or. not my son got
off the sinking ship. There was a Â» large
crowd in our lifeboat and we had to hud

who were managing the boat. We were

were picked up by the tug . Ranger. We

ing experience In midocean as he told the
following story of his experience at the
Broadway dock yesterday morning: .
"I was in my bunk asleep when the
other boat ran us down, but I did not hear
the crash nor feel the Jar of the collision.
My mother woke me up and we dressed
quickly and went on deck. The excite
ment ran high, but Captain Hall and
Mate Nilsen kept calling out for
everybody to keep cool, telling them that
they would get into the lifeboats and life
rafts all right. They handled the situa
tion with great coolness, and the crew
helped to pacify the passengers. Every
body was scrambling for lifeboats, and
the men in the boats had to pull away to
make the struggling people behave them
selves. Finally they all got cooled down,
and the work of rescuing the people went
on in tip-top shape. I saw a big lifeboat
leaving the ship, and as there was room
for one more in it I asked the men to take
my mother along. She did not want to
leave me, but I wanted to see her. safely
off the boat, because I knew I could take
care of myself better when I knew she
was safe.
"After I got mamma off I started to
hunt around the ship for a chance to get
off In a boat myself. By this time nearly
everybody had left the ship, so I went up
stairs, where I heard some men talking.
The first mate was up therewith some
more of the cr,ew and they were trying to
get a big life raft loose. The ship was
sinking fast by this time, and. the mate
and his men were working- . for dear life.
The raft was too big to handle, or some
thing else which I couldn't understand
was the matter; so I saw a raft in, the

it. Â¦Â¦ â¢ - , Â¦

down they went down with it. We worked
for two hours on our raft trying to get

"I was in my room, which was
aft on the port side at the ex
treme end cf the ship, when the' collision
occurred. I ran up the Companionway to
find out the extent of the damage and met
the chief officer, who told me to get ready
to abandon ship. I at once went about
my duties according to instructions, and
proceeded to awaken the passengers and
assist -hem Into the lifeboats. The colli
sion smashed the Walla Walla up for
ward en the port side and cut the quar
termaster's room through into the steer-
Ing gear.
"I concluded that the accident was se
rious and went aft to the main deck and
saw a trailing ship had passed us. At that
time the captain and officers were passing
the passengers Into the lifeboats. I was
asked oy the first assistant engineer and
the chief steward to aid in liberating the
after lifeboats on the hurricane deck, and
to ther. assist in putting blankets into the
lifeboats already launched. I went for
ward on the port side In front of the bar,
and Mr. Nuttman, the purser, asked me
to open the bar and put the catch on.

"At that time Captain Hall Â«ame along,
and the purser's boat was almost full of
passengers. The captain commanded Mr.
Nuttman to take charge of the beat and
go witi it. I asked him why he did not
do so, and he said, 'I will go in a mo
ment.' I begged him to follow the cap
tain's instructions, but he sent me aft to
assist in helping passengers into - the
boats. I saw Mr. Connell, the chief
steward, who was lost, and Mrs. Rey
nolds, the stewardess, who was also loBt,
assisting a lady and a gentleman passenger
into a lifeboat. I then went on the upper
deck and assisted in trying to launch the
large lifeboat aft. In the meantime I saw
Mr. Crosby, the chief engineer, who was
also lost, walking up and down, aiding the
passengers to get into the boats. At that
time the ship was sinking. Mr. Reed, the
lirst assistant engineer, had remained on
the hurricane deck aft assisting in
launching the rafts. As she sank she
went cown forward, and when I saw her
Kinking aft I thought it was time to try
to savu myself. Gibson, one of the wait
ers, had made a rope fast to one of the

"Gibson swung forward and I swung

I heard. I did not hear any bells to slow
up or to stop her, or back her, so I think
the engineer himself stopped the ship
when he felt the collision. In leaving the
boat I had my legs crushed. There were
no rafts around the ship when I got up
stairs, so I had to wait my turn. The
rafts and lifeboats were constantly going
away from the ship and coming back,* or
going around one side and then the other.
At the time the steamer sank I went down
with her and my feet were hurt again in
the wreckage as I came up. â¢ Wheir I came
to the surface I caught hold of a bench
and it kept me afloat until I was picked
up by a life raft. We were out about
thirteen hours before we were picked up
by the Dispatch."

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
In spite of the cost, however, the Germans are
holding bravely on their way toward colonial em
pire. Mr. Harris reports that in a recent address to
the merchants of Leipsic Dr. Vosberg-Rekow, di
rector of the German Bureau for the Preparation of
Commercial Treaties, said: "It is evident we .can
never give up our present policy relative to foreign
affairs or the strenuous efforts being made to become
a great sea power. We must engage in colonial poli
tics on a large scale. We must strive to expand our,
spheres of interest'and to. instill into our people the
consciousness of the necessity of an aggressive policy.
It is only by the annexation of territory beyond the
It is noted, , furthermore, that while the Germans
aim to make use of the colonies as producers of raw
material and consumers of manufactured products
made in Germany, there isalready a tendency in some
of the colonies to do their own manufacturing; and
it is believed the result will be -the establishment in
all successful colonies of something like commercial
and industrial independence, such as has been ob
tained in the British colonies of Canada and Aus
tralia.
The German colonial possessions have an area of
2,S57,ooo square miles. They are scattered in various
parts of the globe', and some of them are said to be
promising, but at present not a single one of them
is self-supporting. The report says the total income
from the colonies for 1900 was but $8,226,470, while
the expenditure required to manitain them was such
that the deficit for the year is estimated at nearly
$7,000,000. Moreover, in spite of the heavy expendi
tures and the efforts of the Government to procure
for the empire all. the trade of the colonies, Germany
gets but 50 per cent of their exports and sends to
them but 60 per cent of their imports.
FROM the State Department at Washington
there has just been issued a summary of a report
from Mr. Harris, consular agent at Eibenstock, v
giving an account of the commercial results of Ger
man experiments in colonial enterprises. The statis
tics given do not make a favorable showing and by
no means bear out the theory that "trade follows the
flag," but none the less the report makes it clear that
the Germans, if not satisfied, are at least determined
to not only carry on the present colonial enterprises,
but to expand them as rapidly as occasion serves.

These official figures seem to negative a great deal
of the expectations that people have in the results of
municipal ownership. The. example, of* Massachu
setts should be followed : everywhere in the establish
ment of Â¦ able and upright public commissions, free
frpm politics, to compel a uniform system > of ac
counting, public and private, , in the. case of all public
utilities. This should. be insisted on ".'as a condition
precedent to embarking ;; in 'public ownership, as by
no ' other means is it i possible to know the gain or
loss in such an "experiment. . .'
Of the 1375 lamps used in street lighting by these
eighteen cities 1250 are only J2oo-candle power and

average $1 71." - , " \ ' ;
In Massachusetts great progress has been made on
the line of public ownership and also in securing such
public and private accounting as permits. a compari
son of the two systems. That State has a gas and
electric light commission, whose members are -ap
pointed for life, or during the proper discharge of
their duty. That commission by law â¢ compels a
sworn accounting by municipalities arid private com
panies, showing every detail jof their business in fur
nishing light. From the report of this commission
the following showing was read by Mr., Jenkins of
San Antonio, Texas, ' to the recent meeting of the
Mayors' Association' of Texas: "Eighteen cities in
Massachusetts own and operate their lighting plants.
Of these fifteen are electric plants only and three
operate gas and electricity/ The expenses of these
eighteen cities : in operating their plants for the year
ending June 30, iooo, were $148,364 21 greater than
their income, and that sum was charged to the cost
of street lighting. The balance sheet of thelighting
plants of these' eighteen cities shows a deficit for the
year of $177,641 25. The rate charged private con
sumers for electricity by these cities varies from 10
cents per 1000 wratts in'Danvers to 25 cents in Hull,
on meter rates and in contract rates', three-fourths of
a cent per hour in North Attlebdrough to one "and a'
fourth cents per hour- in Hull for a sixteen-candle
power lamp. The price/of gas : in the three cities
owning their gas plants was, per 1000 cubic feet:
Middleborough; $2 63;: .Wakefield, $1 75; Westfield,
$1 64. The cost ; of. producing the gas was in: Mid
dleborough, $3 72; Wakefield, $2 05; Westfield, $1 24.
Crediting the expenses _of operation,' the entire -in
come from sales of electricity, and only charging the
net loss from operation to cost of city lighting, we
find the lowest cost - for arc lighting to s be, with /one
exception, $58 13 per year; the highest, $134 08, for
moon table lighting, the average being $75 '60 per
year; and for all-night lighting, $137 73 per lamp.
In the numerous instances in which we have given
the record and results of public ownership it has
seemed to be demonstrated that in the management
of a business 'public waste is equal, or more than
equal, to corporate profit, and that, therefore,' there
is no economy in public ownership, apd frequently
the quality of the service suffers by reason of the in
adaptation of government to business, f '.
THE Call has insisted that' no reliable informa
tion can' be had showing -the relative economy

The above is the Eastern commercial situation. Lo
cally, we are doing a good business. The tendency
in all grains and hay has been upward for some little
time, and prices for all are better than during the
fall, while the demand is excellent, and for some de
scriptions sharp. Flour has been advanced 25c per
barrel, the first change in months. Canned and dried
fruits, wine, wool, hides, hops, potatoes and the gen
eral run of farm produce are meeting with an excep
tionally good demand for this" season of the year,
though some cutting in cured meats were reported
at the close of the week. The export trade of the
port continues brisk, and nothing but cheerful re
ports come from the wholesalers, jobbers and retail
ers. If there is any lull in the East,' it has not ex
tended to California, which was never more prosper
ous than to-day. The banks, both city and country,
report large supplies of money available for solvent
borrowers at fair rates, and there are no failures suf
ficiently large to disturb the equanimity of the mer
cantile element Hence. we ought to be satisfied with
the outlook at the beginning. of the year, and most
oEuve.- " - ;.:â¢.,;
In spite of this unfavorable showing of the bank
clearings, however, commercial reports received from
all parts of the country were uniformly cheerful and
buoyant and expressive of confidence in the coming
year. The iron and steel situation continues to show
gfreat strength, gains rather than losses being re
ported from all points. The car shortage, however,
is still a serious drawback' to this industry and
threatens to affect both production and consumption.
Some of the blast furnaces are already shutting down
en this account, and supplies of coke are piling up
at the ovens. But on the other. hand, .Southern pig
iron has advanced 50 cents per ton, and in the East
ro orders are accepted for delivery before July 1. This
firmness in the raw product, however, is offset by a
cecline of $2 per ton in wire and nails owing to.in
creasing competition of outside makers. The other
staples are generally reported in good 'condition.
Rubber goods have advanced 8 per cent over a year
ago, but shoe shipments are decreasing, though still
larger than at this time last year. Copper has again
teen cut and brass has gone down in sympathy,
while tin is also lower. Provisions are unsettled at
Chicago, going up one' day and down the next, which
has been the rule for some time, the general plane of
values remaining practically unchanged. The grain
markets are quieter than they were a month or so
ago, but values have not varied much during ' this
period. Otherwise the great staples show no change
v'orthy of comment.
THERE was not much feature to trade last week.
There never is at the turn of the year. There
was a. falling o& of 9.4 per. cent from the pre
ceding year in the volume of business, however, as
s,ho\vn by the country's bank clearings, and for the
first time in a long while New York recorded a de
crease, the loss being 13.2 per cent. Boston, Phila
delphia, St. Louis and Cincinnati also showed- a loss
in clearings, while the gains of the other large centers
were small, that at Chicago being only 0.4 per cent
over the same week ir. 1901. The clearings of New
York were $1,377,000,000, quite a sharp decline from
the $2,000,000,000 and $2,350,000,000 of the past few
months, and the combined clearings of the whole
country were less than the recent average of New
York City alone. The failures were 270, against 266
last year, but aside from the embarrassment of the
fjreat Cleveland electric railroad and telephone syndi
cate, which was capitalizedcfor $130,000,000, they were
generally unimportant. The suspension of this syn
dicate was due to the undertaking of too many differ
ent enterprises, for while most of them paid good
dividends, the income derived from them had to be
civerted to build up the others to a paying basis, and
the load was too large.
BEGINNING OP THE COMMERCIAL

PRINCE K A W ANA N A K OA
CLAIMS BRIDE TO-DAY
DR. NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER will be the next president of Colum
bia University, of which he has been the head of the department of phil
osophy and education since 1895. Upon the resignation of Mayor-elect Seth
Low of New York Professor Butler was appointed acting president of the
university and has had charge of the administration of the Institution since that
time. . . Â¦
Nicholas Murray Butler is a graduate of Columbia University of the class of
'82. The degrees of master of arts and doctor of philosophy vwere conferred upon
him at the close pf the two succeeding years. In 189S he received the degree of doc
tor of laws from Syracuse University. He is one of the foremost educators, both
theoretical and practical, In the United States.
After leaving Columbia College, in 1884, Butler was for one year in the univer
sities of Berlin and Paris. He returned to Columbia to accept the position of as
'sistant in philosophy, , which he held for four years. In'lS90 he became prof essor
of philosophy,, ethics and psychology and delivered a course of lectures on the his
tory of education, -which greatly enhanced his growing reputation as a student of
advanced educational theories. ,
For.five years between 1S86 and 1891, Professor Butler was. president of the New
York College for the Training of Teachers, now â¢ the Teachers' College. He has
been for many years one of the most active and influential members of the Amer
ican Psychological Association and the National Council of Education. He is also
an editor of the Educational Review.
: -In March, 1S99, Professor Butler gained great publicity by applying the epithet
"educational mastodon" to Joseph J. Little, then president of the Central Board
of Educatfon. Mr. Little' took .the matter so seriously that he carried it before the
. Grand Jury of New York County and procured an indictment against Professor
Butler for 'criminal libel. ...
The affair was subsequently settled in an amicable way.
Professor Butler, besides being actively engaged in the work of education
itself, is the author of many of the best known works upon the subject.
.This is the fifteenth college presidency offered to Dr. Butler. â¢ The other four
teen offers were declined by him. .' He has just turned his .thirty-ninth year. ,.
Representative Lovering of .: Massachusetts intro
duced at -the last session of Congress a resolution
providing for the adoption of a constitutional amend
ment, giving Congress authority, to legislate on the
subject. In New England the proposed amendment
will have strong support and doubtless the Northern
States generally will favor it, as ft -is. now recognized
that interstate competition renders^ labor legislation
a matter of national as well as : of State concern.
This, therefore, adds another to the aiready numer
ous list of ; proposed ,, constitutional amendments.\
Each and all ofthehitend to the increase of Federal
power. The' nearer ; the 'are drawn together
the greater is felt to be the needjof uniform legisla^
tipn on many; subjects thai 'in; former /years were .left
to the States., If the process of 'amending the con-:
stitution' were easy there" is no telling to what extent
it would ' be : changed by the numerous â¢ classes ,'now
pressing for amendment for one purpose or another.
Fortunately the process is not easy. Where it is im
peratively necessary we' may safely say that amend
ments will be made, but otherwise the people will
prefer to put up with evils rather than run the risk
of worse by too free a change of the constitution un
der which the affairs of the country have been admin
istered with success for more than a hundred years.
In the South itself a strong movement" is under
way to bring about the enactment of labor, laws sim
ilar to those which have been adopted in the North/
but it is feared the efforts in that direction will be
long, in accomplishing' the desired purpose. 'The
more, eager advocates of , uniform labor laws have,,
therefore,. turned to. Congress and an attempt will be â¢
made to establish the uniformity : by Federal statute.
OUT 6f the competition which the Northern
cotton mills' have had to, meet' since the de-.
/velopment of cotton manufacturing in ' the
Soutn there has arisen a. demand among Northern
workmen for the ; establishment .. of uniform labor
laws throughout the Union. It is known that the
mills in the' South employ a considerable proportion
of child labor and that the hours of labor required
of all classes of workers are much greater than in the
North. Consequently the competition is felt to-be
unfair and efforts are â¢ being made to equalize the
conditions.

quick-firers were tried at the testing butts
in one day with satisfactory results. The
guns consisted of 6-inch, 4-Inch, 20-pound
ers and 12-pounders. The Chief Commis
sioner of the arsenal has received urgent
orders from the Viceroys and Governors
of nine provinces to supply them with
large number of similar quick-firers, as
well as with smokeless powder, shot and
shell, which will be used In rearming the
forces on land and, sea of the nine .prov

Thetrials of the French submarine boat
Espadon last month proved very sucess
ful as to speed. She averaged 9.47 knots
during a surface run of fifty-three hours,
an excess of 1.47 knots over the contract.

The French submarines, Narval and
Morse, made a successful attack on two
cnast dpfpr-<!Â«Â» Â«sVt1ns. T?" i "vfrÂ»oÂ«i and Valmv.
which represented the attacking force, and
steamed into the harbor of Cherbourg. As
soon as the approach of the two ships was
signaled the two submarines got
ready. , and, taking advantage of
the darkness, disappeared unobserved
below the surface of the water
right in line of the attacking
ships, which they successfully torpedoed.
Those aboard the Bouvines and Valmy
were not aware of the presence of the
submarines until they rose to the surface,
and it is claimed that the utility of the
latter has been demonstrated by these
maneuvers. --i*. '.'.'.-
Sweden has ordered its first torpedo boat
destroyer from Yarrow. It Is of 320 ton3
displacement and thirty-one knots con
tract speed for three' hours. The price
paid i3 $241,500, with a premium of $2300 for
each cuarter knot excess of speed. A
balloon ship is to be built at a cost of
about $40,000, and several submarine boats
are recommended. ?.i*'Â«fT-j
Navy building Is' unusually active in
Sweden, and especially so in coast defense
ships. Four coast defense ships were
launched last year, namely: Toperheten.
Vasa and Acrau, of 3650 tons each, and
Dristigheten. of 3450 tons. The three first
named will be completed this year and the
fourth has had her trial, attaining a speed
of seventeen knots. Their armor belt is
7% inches Krupp plates, and their arma
ment consists of two 8.2-inch guns in two
turrets, six 5.9-inch quick-firers, ten 2.2
inch and two 1.4-lnch in broadside. The
twelve boilers are of the Yarrow type, and
the normal supply of coal 300 tons. . Three
older vessels of this type, the Svea, Gota
and Thule, are being modernized at a cost
of $950,000, and five monitors are -ecelving
new guns.
A recent dispatch concerning wireless
telegraphy' at sea states that: "Admiral
Bradford of the Bureau of. Equipment haa
Â»asked that the armored cruisers of the
Pennsylvania class have their masts and
rigging so arranged that the -wireless sys
tem can be introduced. This will necessi
tate the lengthening of the masts of the
ships and the insulation of the metal rig
ging by the use of hemp covering for hal
yards." The ships referred to have not
yet assumed any definite tangible shape
and their contract time for completion is
set for January. 1904, with the chance of
being one year behind time. Admiral
Bradford's move toward adoption of wire
less telegraphy in our navy cannot be said
to be rash when, as he knows, members
of ships in foreign navies have used the
system successfully for upward of a. year.
j This incidental part of the system, such 33
taller masts and Insulated rigging, is too
trifling for an official of his standing and
, responsibility to talk about, and Indicates
! a lack of go-aheadatlveness of the bureau
he represents. It is but small satisfaction
to learn that our navy will adopt wireless
telegraphy in 1904 or 1903, when other
navjes find it useful now.
There will be ten retirements for age
during the year In the higher grades of.
line officers in the United States Navy, in
this order: Rear Admirals "W. T. Samp

Ford and Andrade are of the former engi

they will be retired as rear admirals and
receive $4150 annually. Rear Admirals
Sampson, Cromwell. Howell and Farqu

major general, will get the handsome re
tired pay of Jp625 a year.
Three assistant surgeons in the United
States - Navy have successfully passed
their physical and moral examinations far
promotion, but failed to pass the profes
sional examination. The latter failure i3
undoubtedly a very serious drawback to
their efficiency as healers of wounds and
disease. The "pull" will now be applied to
obtain a re-examination in the near fu
ture, during which period of "boning up"
and "cramming" the lot of the defenseless
sailors and marines Is to be commiserated.
That the time has come for the people to grapple
with this problem in earnest is now well understood
by all who have given it any consideration whatever.
The confusion and conflict in our laws should be
cleared away and legislation be made to conform to
the nature of the climate and the relation of water
to land. Suggestions are made in the report as to
the best means of accomplishing that end. â¢ The ex
amples of other States and of other nations furnish
lessons which we should carefully study. The subject
is worthy the best efforts of the ablest and most pro
gressive men in the State. Moreover, the reform in
the irrigation laws should not be delayed. As Pro
fessor Mead says: "If the creation of institutions
worthy of the time and place can come as a part of
the world-wide movement toward the Pacific Coast
and of the material development of arid America by
public and private aid, which is now being' so stren
uously urged, the opening years of the twentieth
century will witness a new era of home-making in the
The problem before the people of the State is to .
devise some means of adjusting the control of water
so as to . conserve all of these interests. Unfortu
nately, the early settlers and founders of California
came from humid States and brought their old laws
and customs regulating water rights with them. The.
consequence is a confusion between the real needs
of the State and the statutes that govern irrigation
questions. "Ability and success in material develop
ment," says the report, "have been rendered futile
by a marked failure in legislation. Some of the best
examples of ditch construction tq be found in this
country are in California, but the operation 01 these
works is embarrassed by legislation which violates
every principle necessary to enduring success."
With all those advantages of soil and climate there
remains, however, much for man to do. The report
says: "Although irrigation is not a necessity, it is
everywhere of value, because its magic brings into
full fruition all of the attractions with which the State
is. so generously endowed." There are, however, in
California obstacles in the way of irrigation that are
not met with in any other arid State. In no other
are rivers used for both navigation and irrigation,
nor is there such a complexity of claims upon streams
and water rights.. Some of these claims cover the
right to the use of water for placer mining, some for
the supply .of water to cities, some for the generation
of electric power â and the' development of that
power, the report says, "will not cease until the latent
force of the cascades in every mountain canyon has
been harnessed in one way or another to the wheels
of California's industries."
The report begins by pointing out our unrivaled
possibilities. "As an agricultural State," it says,
"California stands alone. No other, humid or arid
commonwealth has as diversified products or high
priced farming land. In some respects the climate is
marvelous in its possibilities. The usual limitations
imposed by latitude are here set aside. Oranges ripen
as early and as surely at Oroville, ioo miles north of
San Francisco, as at San Diego, 500 miles south of
that city; and much of the State has the unique dis
tinction of being able to grow all the products of
New England and of Florida on the same acre of
land. Sacramento, which has the same latitude as
Southern Illinois, is surrounded by districts where
bluegrass lawns are shaded by palm and orange
trees. The summers are not too- hot for the turf,
nor the winters too cold for the trees. * j* * It
is the only State where crops can be harvested with
abselute assurance that rain will not. injure them, yet
where those crops can be grown by the aid of rain
fall alone."
-pvROFESSOR ELWOOD MEAD'S report, of
r-^the investigations made.in 1900 into the irriga
Â¦Â¦Â¦ tion problems of California has been published
in a form handsome, enough to attract attention
even if the public were indifferent to the importance
of the subject. It constitutes;. however, so valuable
a contribution toward the solution of some _ of the
difficulties in the way of the full development of the
agricultural resources of the State that no one who
gives it anything like a careful study can remain in
different to the need of adopting' a comprehensive
scheme of irrigation such as iias been suggested by -
Mr. Mead and the 'eight experts who assisted him
in making the investigations.

"After I left Folsom." continued Ross,
"I determined to lead a proper, life. I
had read a great deal of literature while
In prison and am familiar with " many of
the classics. What I had read taught me
that Jt was best to settle down and not
rove around. But the pernicious influence
of Folsom Prison seemed to follow me
everywhere. An angel In San Quentin or
Folsom would be corrupted. - I have a

Ross then detailed how he managed to
get his plunder to San Francisco and how
he was often tempted to send it back to
the owner. All he realized from the rob

THE Supreme Court of the United
States â¢will be asked to-day to
save the life of Herbert Ross, .
who Is condemned to die at San
Quentin prison next Friday morn-
Ing for the killing of Deputy Sheriff W.
J. Ward of San DiejbO County in a des
perate attempt to escape from custody in
November, 1899.
Ross, who had a prior conviction against
him, was sentenced in San Diego in 1893
to ten years in San Quentin, having plead
ed guilty to a charge of, burglary.
Deputy Sheriff Ward was in charge of
Ross on the . steamer Santa Rosa when
the officer received injuries at the hands
of the convict that resulted in his death
a few days later. When Ward took his
prisoner on board the steamship the most
friendly relations existed between them.
The officer treated the prisoner with con
sideration and the trip was expected to bs
devoid of Incident.
At Santa Barbara Sheriff Matthew Stew
art boarded the vessel with a prisoner
named Andrew. Castro, en route to San
Quentin. On Saturday, November 11, 1899,
while the Santa Rosa was tied up to the
wharf at Port Harford, tne two officers
and their prisoners took a promenade^n
the deck during the afternoon. Ross ask
ed Ward to take him to his cabin, as he
was feeling tired -and sleepy. /
Ward complied with the request, and
escorked his shackled prisoner to his
stateroom. With none to witness, the
deed, Ross suddenly made an attack on
the unfortunate officer with a heavy glass
water bottle. While Ward was dozing in
a chair Ross struck him on the head with
the bottle and In the struggle that en
sued continued to beat Ward until he
was rendered helpless. Locking Ward In
the cabin, Ross slipped down a rope Into
the water and hid under the wharf.
He subsequently climbed aboard the
ship and gave himself up to Sheriff Stew
art, who found Ward in a dying condi
tion. Ward was taken to the hospital at
San Luis Oblspo, where he died on the
2Sth of the month. Ross, after being
taken to San Quentin,- was returned to
San Luis Obispo, where he was tried and
found guilty of murder in the first degree
and sentenced to death.
Take Steps to Save Boss.
His attorneys, William Graves of San
Luis Obispo and ex-Supreme Court Jus
tice Van Fleet, have taken every step to '
save Ross from the gallows, i The case I
was taken to the Supreme Court of the
State on an appeal for a new trial, which
was denied. The United States Circuit
Court of Appeals was asked last week to
issue a writ of habeas corpus for Ross,
but the Federal Judges declined to inter
fere in the case.
With but four days of life left to Ross,
his attorneys will seek the intervention of
the highest court of resort in the land
failing which Ross will pay the dread pen
alty, of the law on Friday morning, un
less the Governor intercedes.
Ross ascribes his present terrible posi
tion to two factors: the Jack of self-con
trol and the persecution of his former as
sociates in prison and of law officers.
The condemned man yesterday received
a representative of The Call and for two
hours he talked of his life and the near
approach of death. Within a few feet of
the spot in the old furniture factory of
San Quentin Prison, where the gallows
awaits its twenty-ninth victim, and the
ropes are already stretched for the sched
uled grewsome event of Friday, Ross told
of his life that will probably be cut short
An. its twenty-seventh year.
"My name Is not Ross." said the con
demned man, "but I will not tell my right I
name. My mother is alive and she knows
nothing of my fate. I was born east of '
the Rocky Mountains, where my father J
was superintendent of a coal mine. He i
was killed by an explosion in 18S3. I have
three brothers and one â¢ sister living In '
California. They know of my condtion '
and have helped me with means to save
my life. They have kept everything from
my mother as to what I have done. -
"I was educated in the public schools
of the State in which I was born and I Â¦

Â¦ "Even in prison it is possible for a con
vict to show that; he Is a man and a de

It is easy for people to say that death
is ;to be preferred â¢ to 1 life imprisonment,
but they do; not know what- it mean3 to

the, law. I, realize that if . the Supreme
Court of the United 'States will not inter
fere in my case that I have but four days
to -live, r I am resigned i to my fate, and if
I am to die I will do so manfully." _ . ;
â¢ Ross was visited yesterday afternoon by
his sister and. her husband. The officers
of- San Quentin Prison declined to make
known ,- their identity. â- â¢
"Prisons^ should be so, governed that
the prisoners should be graded. The as
sociation of young prisoners, sent i up for
small . offenses, with old and . hardened
criminals eradicates all good feelings and
dooms ; them : to a felon's fate. <--â¢Â¦."
Says He Will Die Manf ully.
"I realize that I have lacked will power
and -self-control and that there is no ex
cuse why I ' should have committed any
crime. I should have told every one that
I was an ex-convict when I first came
out of Folsom and asked them to help
me along. If Judges and law officers
would help ex-convlcts.to reform instead
of persecuting them and hounding them,
lots of young men would leave prison and
become good citizens. The only encour
agement they , now receive is from . old
convicts, who- lead them on to deeper
crime. : -' >-. ..
When Ross was asked what he consid
ered the greatest mistake of his life he
answered: "It was my first step In crime
at Tulare.""
In eloquent tones the condemned man
continued:
"Stewart cursed me and said, 'If that
man dies I will 'hang you for it.' I was
convicted on perjured testimony. Castro,
the convict, swore that when he was
ironed tome that I told him I intended to
kill both the* officers. He has confessed
to I three people since then that he gave,
false evidence in order to help himself, i"
sent him a letter here in San Quentin and
he told me that if my lawyer would get
him out of trouble he would tell the truth.
"I believe that I am guilty ; of man
slaughter and have never denied striking
Ward. I am not a brute devoid of all
feeling, as some want to make me out.
A- few minutes before Ward took me to
the cabin he showed me the photos of his
*ife and children. I had no feeling
against him, for he treated me kindly.
Why should I kill him? I only wanted to
render him senseless so that I could es
cape.".
Says Castro Testified Falsely.
"I got his keys and $20 in gold from his
pockets and slid down a rope into the
water. I hid under the wharf. I was
there for more than an hour. Then I won
dered if I had hurt Ward seriously and I
made up. my mind to go back to the ship.
"I climbed up a rope and went to Sher
iff Stewart. I was afraid that I had hurt
Ward badly as everything was so quiet on
the ship. I told Stewart that I had
struck Ward and I wanted him to see If
his injuries were very bad. Stewart took
me to the cabin and broke the door in
that I had locked. He found Ward sitting
in : a chair with his bead resting in his
hands and bleeding.
stole six valises and got away with them.
I put them in a trunk and shipped them
to San Francisco. I stole them on the Im
pulse of the moment, i I was caught soon
afterward, and in order to avoid a trial I
entered a plea of guilty and was given ten
years in San Quentin.. :
"I admit that I assaulted Deputy Sheriff
Ward when he was bringing me up on
the Santa Rosa. I never Intended to kill
him. All I thought of was -to make my
escape. I dreaded the term in , prison. I
had.no plans laid as to how I could get
away. When Ward took me to the caDin
he dozed . off to sleep in a chair.. I saw
the heavy water bottle and the thought
came into my head that if I could render
him senseless for an hour or so I could
get away. I struck him a light blow and
he jumped-up and grappled with me. I
struck him again, and as he continued to
.fight" I hit him a third time. If I had in
tended to kill him I could have Â¦ done so
with, one heavy blow of the bottle. I
could have crushed his head like an egg
with that thick bottle if I had so desired.

ous role of Santuzza in "Cavalleria," and
there is plenty of good material in the
Grand Opera-house Stock Company for
her support. "Comedy and Tragedy" has
not been seen 'here for some time and
should prove an Interesting addition to
the bill.
"King Henry VIII," with Madame Mod
jeska as Queen Katherine, and Louis
James as Cardinal VVolsey, is the import
ant attraction at the Columbia Theater
this week. The leading actors bring their
fame with them, but there are many good
players less well known here in the sup
porting company. The scenic effects, for
which the play affords many splendid op
portunities, are complete, correct in his
torical detail, and exceptionally rich and
handsome. The organization 'lumbers
thirty-seven people and two carloads of
scenery are used in the production.
The rollicking fun and ingenious com
plications of "Whose Baby Are You?"
served to keep the California's audience
hilariously amused from tho begining to
the end of the farce last night. The play
is well acted all through and prettily
staged. It deserves a larger audience
than greeted it last evening. Charles "W.
Bowser plays the bewildered artist, who
has babies thrust upon him at every turn,
and isi fully adequate in the part. May
Vokesi gives a quaint sketch of Abigail,
the janitor's daughter, and gets a good
deal of genuine fun out of the role. Her
make-up is a thing of beauty. One of the
cleverest .things in the farce is Fred Run
nel as the Baron Leopold. He has a
Dutch accent that sounds as if it were
made in Germany and throughout looks
and acts like an animated Pliegende
Blatter sketch. The rest of the company
is capable and the piece goes with snap
and vim throughout. The climax of the
second act, when three babies are discov
ered all by their tiny, selves in the middle
of the stage, is the funniest feature of the
play and when the astonished infants
laughed and cried alternately at their
houseful of admirers the enthusiasm
reached its limit. "Whose Baby Are
You?" should do a good business this
week. Richard Golden, in "Old Jed
Prouty," follows.

he was first imported, mystified the house
with his phenomenal lightning calcula
tions and mental exactness with dates.
Eddie Girard and ' Jessie Gardner, al
ways one of the most popular teams that
annually vi3it the coast, are the main
feature of the performance. "The Sou
brette and the Cop," so long associated
with Girard's career, has many whimsical
charms added to it this year and was
most cordially encored by the big audi
ence. Miss Gardner sings and dances with
animation and is a finished comedienne.

CONGREGATIONAL
CHURCH THRIVES
Rev. Dr. Adams Reports
a Large Id crease in
Membership.
Denies Report' That House
of Worship Will Be
Removed.
Harmony, handshaking and all-round
congratulatory greeting marked the serv
ice at the First Congregational Church,
Mason and Post streets, yesterday. ] At
the communion service the attendance
was the largest. that has been known at
any similar service for the last five years.
About two-thirds of the members of the
church were present, which is a large pro
portion, allowing for sick and absent,
members.' To add to the fervor of the
service twenty-six new members were re
ceived by the pastor, the Rev. Dr. George
C. Adams.--
Dr. Adams announced with much satis
faction that no less than 117 members
had been received during the past year,'
of whom, he was especially pleased to
note, fifty-five were men. The proportion
of males t o females in the membership
nad, he said, Increased* in a year from one
to two and one-twentieth to one to-one
and five-sixths. The attendance was at
all times about one-half men, a fact which
refuted the statements frequently made
that men do not go to church. < -
Dr. Adams said that the membership of
the First Congregational Church is now
Â«00 and all are in direct communication
with the church, while the increase in the
regular income last year was $1000, a gain
for which the people were highly praised.
During the service the pastor asked for
5100 for the deacons' fund for the help of
the poor of the church, and in response
the offering amounted to over one hun
dred -and eleven dollars.
The attendance at the first Sunday
school meeting of the New Year was also
the largest for five years.
Dr. Adams said yesterday:
I am pleased to say that besides the pros
perity of the First Congregational Church dur
ing the past year there has been absolute
harmony amone the members, and . the spirit
of church work and consecration is growing
rapidly. This church, located as it is down
town, offers unusual advantages to the large
and increasing number of people in the hotels
and boarding-houses. *
For some time there have been rumors aSoat
that the First Concretrational Church con
templated moving; from its present location. Aa
to that I would like to say most emphatically
that there is no foundation whatever for the
reports.

Ross learned of his father's death in
1S93 and went home in February, 1894, and
later joined his brothers and sisters in the
Puget Sound country.
"That was the happiest time of my life,"
said Ross, "and though I had to work Hard
in a logging camp I had nothing to bother
about. I left that country on account of a
girl. I don't want to mention her name,
for it would only disgrace her. I ran
away with her, but her folks got track of

me go away. We were in love with each

down in the southern seas and with the

to steady the ship was ordered - lowered.
As it came down everybody aboard no
ticed that it formed an exact likeness 'of
the bust-of President McKinley. * "Some

and, true enough, when the vessel reached
Manila there was a jcable announcing. the

The Peking brings the news that the

into Honolulu in distress. The latter was
on her way from Puget Sound to Austra

off the Oregon coast in a gale and sprang
a leak.. The captain would not take any
chances, so he put into the Hawaiian cap

even at that early hour overcome the lead

ECTOR, the crack representative
II )j ot Albert Curtis' kennel of fast
Syc; greyhounds, won first honors in
ii. x< tne Inaugural stake yesterday at
Union Coursing Park. 'Rector's
victory' was expected, the speedy young
ster being quoted first choice in the long
odds book and a favorite in. all his
courses.
The backers of favorites had a record
breaking day. In the Inaugural stakes
there were but two short ends to land in
the first two trials on the cardâCold,Shiv
ers beating Little Sister at 5 to 3 and
Tapicca defeating Homer Boy at 5 to 2.
When Rector and Wedgewood were sent
to the slips for the deciding course Rectof
had first call in the betting and sold at
3 to 5.
The Curtis dog showed the lead up the
field, beating his opponent two lengths for
the turn. Wedgewood laid off, while Rec
tor forced , the hare to him. Wedgewood
nipped it up, but lost his hold and stum
bled. Recovering himself he drove for the
kill and ended the course with Rector one
point in the lead.
T. J. Cronin's big black youngster, Tra
lee Boy, added more glory to his record
by annexing the open stake. Eugene
Geary's America was the runner-up. He
lost by one point, the score, 4 to 3, being
the same as that of the Inaugural final.

In stopping a runaway yesterday after
noon in Golden Gate Park Chris Arrc
lanes, a well-knowaÂ» park policeman, per
formed at daring act. John Borland* wa*
driving a light two-horse team through
the park. " He had stopped for a moment
near the stone bridge. His horaoa be
came frightened and started on a wild
run. Borland evidently could do nothing
to restrain them.
Policeman Arrelanes, who wa3 mounte-l
at the time, saw the runaway as it was
about to turn down toward Dick
ey's saloon. Arrelane3 put spurs ty
his horse and rode until he was
abreast of the two runaway horses
and then, without slackening his
pace, he reached over and seized tno rehi
of one of the horses. Still retaining his
seat in the saddle, Arrelanes exerted hH
strength and pulled the horses astrtda the
wagon pole, thereby putting an end to the
runaway. The feat, besides showing brav
ery 00 Arrelanes* part, wa3 a very ditu
cult piece of horsemanship.
The pleasant weather which prevailed ia
the early part of yesterday afternoon at
tracted a very large crowd to the park
and beach. Hundreds of men, women and
children promenaded up and down the
beach hear the Cliff House, while hun
dreds more visited the park to hear the
music and view the attractions. A cold
wave struck the beach about 4 o'clock
and drove the seekers of fresh air back
into the city. . .

The champion mare cf Palo Alto farm
was Sunol, 2:08V4- The champion stallion
was Palo Alto, 2:0S?4. a great favorite of
Senator Stanford's. Electioneer, although
he died in 1S90, has to his credit the
largest number of 2:30 trotters accredited
to any sire. At one time his sons and
daughters held all world's records. The
Abbot, 2:0314, Adbell, Arion and Fantasy
are among his most famous offspr.ng.
Beautiful Bells, which is still alive, pro
duced ten foals which were in the 2:20
class. Sontag Mohawk was considered
one of the greatest brood mares in Amer
ica. The following mares will be sold
here:
Palo Alto stock farm, founded by Sen
ator Leland Stanford in 1S77, will soon be
but a memory. Ths establishment made
famocs by Electioneer, Arion, Palo Alto,
The Abbot and other trotters is soon to
pass out of existence.
An order has issued from the business
department of Stanford University direct
ing that the stock now on the farm be
sold. Ten brood mares whose progeny
have brought fame to Palo Alto will be
retained. These will be pensioned untii
their death. Three of them will be burled
in the gravevard on the farm. Tnose
which will be retained are:. Mary Osborn,
Beautiful Bells, Manette, Waxana, Wild
flower, Manzanita. Sallie Benton. Esther,
Lady Ellen and Elaine. The three which
will* be placed in the graveyard at their
death are Beautiful Be:ls, Elaine and
Manzanita.
The remainder of the horses will be a.s
posed of in four great sales. The first
of these will be held in this city on the
30th inst. Brood mares only will be dis
posed of. At Cleveland, Ohio, May 12.
yearlings and two and three year olds will
be led into the sales ring. At Sacramento
during the State Fair various grades of
trotters and brood mares will be s-jid. At
New York in November the stallions,
brood mares and colts will complete the
dispersal.
The farm was founded by Senator Stan
ford in ihTI with some fifty horses. It
grew steadily. In 1SS1 the first trotter3
were put on the track, and new horses
were developed each year until 1S98.
The farm reached its highest develop
ment in 1S93, the year Senator Stanford
died, when there were 1350 horses in the
stables and paddocks. In lfcOS the devel
opment of fast trotters was stopped.
Since that time much of the stock has
been sold, leaving only 250 head to be dis
posed of. -. : .
Many wonderful horses were bred at the
farm, bringing fame to the estab.ishment
and winning many races. In 18S2 every
trotting record in the world was held by
horses bred at Palo Alto. The perform
ances of some of its horses have been
wonderful. Bell Bird, a* yearling, trotted
a mile in 2:26^4. Arion, a two-year-o.d,
trotted a mile to a high-wheel sulky }n
2:1034, a record which stands to-day.
Arion, a three-year-old, trotted a mile in
2:10^, while Sunol made the circuit of a
track in 2:08^4.

clever playing. It also served to show
what a great all-round player is McHaie,
who will play left field for the San Fran

ning he caught a fly from Sullivan's bat
after a Ions run. In the sixth he picked
a fly out of the crowd of spectators along
the left field foul line fence. At the bat
he lined out a three-bagger and a two

R. N. Whitney allowed Allen a handicap
of "one-half 3a." After losing the first
set, 6-1, Allen played a strong game ana
managed to win the last two sets and
match, 1-6, 6-2, 6-4. - ,
This brought play down Jo the final,
with MacGavin on one side of the net ami
Allen on the opposite. From the way this
match started it seemed Allen would win
easily. In the first two sets he lost but
two games. In the third set MacGavin
by playing more carefully won by a score
of 6-1. Allen won the next set and match.
The complete score was 6-0, 6-2, 1-6, b-J.

tary of Mayor Phelan, was named for the
place, but there was some hitch in th>:
proceedings and the appointment was not
made. The resignation of Russell was not
acted upon, and the matter went over to
await the result of Russell's illness. Now
that the necessity, of appointing a suc
cessor has arisen Fay is again advanced
for the honor. It is known he has the
support of Mayor Phelan and that the
latter"s influence with the present Board
of Supervisors Is far-reaching:. Last night
the matter was clinched in Fa5-'s favor,
and it is more than likely that he -will be
named for the place to-morrow. Th-Â»
actual appointment may not, however, be
made until the final meeting of the board
en Wednesday.
Keane is a young attorney of promise,
who has transacted RueFs probate busi
ness icr several years. The fact that he
has been chosen by the Mayor-elect for
the important post of private secretary
will ue a painful surprise to many who
h&u coveted the honor with its saiary of
42W a moitth, and wtio were lea to bo
iieve thai they had some show. The hand
of Kuef, who is the Mayor-elect's attor
ney, is quite plain to be seen in the <Je
tertnination 01 Schmitz on mis point.
Keane is an affable young man, ana ins
iriends declare that he is xn every way
qualified to nil the duties of the re
sponsible ofjice to wnicn tie wiil be called
oy the incoming Mayor. \..-S
The Theatrical Kmpioyes' Union is up
in arms ags.inst Schmitz, who, the mem
bers allege, has broken his promise to ap
point their president, S. Simmons, to a
place on the Board of Public Works, it
is claimed that the Mayor-elect had some
time ago atrreed to name Simmons fur
the place, but a few days since he. an
nounced that it would be impossible lor
him to supply the goods, rie offered,
however, to make Simmons a Fire Com
missioner, but this was declined on the
ground that Simmons was making as
much at his business as that office would
pay in the way of salary. The cordial re-,
lations existing between Schmitz and tiie
members of the theatrical fraternity .ire
in consequence somewhat strained, ami
unless the alleged agreement made to
Â«;ive Simmons a place on the Board oÂ£
Works is carried out an open rupture is
inevitable. .
It was positively announced in political
circles last night that Attorney Harry
W. Hutton would be named as Police
Commission sr when the list of appoint
ments to be made by the Mayor-elect is
formally presented Wednesday. Hutton
was attorney for the labor unions in the
strike, and during the campaign he wtu
an ardent supporter of the labor ticket.
Hutton's views concerning the police were
often forcibly expressed in his addresses
during the campaign, and his appointment
will- not be regarded with confidence by
the department.
The speculation among the politicians
as to the selection of a private secretary
10 be made bj* Mayor-elect Schmitz was
ended yesterday with the authoritative
announcement that George B. Keane, a
clerk in the employ of Attorney Ruel,
would receive tb* appointment.
DENVERITES ARM
TO CHECK CRIME
At the business session the convention
re-elected Leon Zolotokoff of Chicago as
gTand master and I. "VVelpe of" Chicago as
treasurer. It was voted to held the next
convention in Milwaukee.
If your plan will offer freedom take Palestine
and I will be with you, and we will all work
together.
I have a nation. I will not exchange it for
a nation in Jerusalem.' I have my flag, and
I will not exchange it. I . have a legally as
sured home, for. after all, what we suffer here
is inconsequential. Let the Jew learn to strike
back when he is struck and they will learn to
leave him alone. His condition would be bet
tered if he would keep the rest In wholesome
fear of a Jewish fist and a Jewish kick.
Shall we call them to America? I would
gladly do so if their coming would be a solu
tion of the problem. But it would not be.
From the- prey of Russia to the sweatshops 'of
America does not spell redemption. !
It is for these Jews that the name of their
country spellg "Hope." I should not be a
man if I did not realize that for these perse
cuted Jews Jerusalem spells reason. Justice,
manhood and liberty.
I agree with you that the condition of
7,000,0GO Jews in Russia, Roumanla and Ga
licla is a blot on civilization and cries out to
heaven for redress. The world Is stirred by
accounts of suffering of the women In thÂ«
concentration camps in South Africa. No
doubt their condition is bitter, but the con
dition of the Jews in Russia Is worse. Tet.
while voices are raised in protest in England
against her treatment of the South African
â¢vromen, no voice is raised in behalf of the
Jew. Why? Because- they are Jews. ! What
matters it that they suffer: . they are Jews.
Behind them stands no guns nor armored ships.
They are Jews. They have suffered eighteen
centuries: let them suffer more. That Is thÂ«
condition which calls out to heaven for Justice
and not for charity.
I also agree with you that if these Jews say
that they have no country they are justified.
What flag is theirs? They must -pay blood
taxes to the Czar, yet they are. not treated as
subjects. In Roumania they are declared to be
aliens. The fault lies with the Government
of Russia, Roumania and Galicia.
Rabbi Emll G. Hirsch gave his views on
the proposed movement. In view of the
fact that the Zionists consider Dr.
Hirsch's attitude on the question hostile
to their plans great interest was mani
fested in his remarks. He said:
We do not mean to take the Jews by the
neck "and throw them Into Palestine, nor do we
intend to transform the Jews overnight Into an
ag: (cultural people. We want to resume the
broken thread of our nation; we want to> show
to the world the moral strength, the Intellectual
power of the Jewish people. We want a place
where the race can again bÂ« centralized.
CHICAGO, Jan. . 5.â Impetus to the
movement to establish the Jewish race
once more in Palestine was given to-night
at a mass-meeting of' Zionists at the Me
dinah Temple Theater. Two thousand
Hebrews, for the most part supporters of
the plan to open again the promised land
for the chosen people, crowded the hall.
The meeting was in connection with the
annual convention of Western Zionists,
whose organization embraces ten States.
The plan determined upon at the Basle,
Switzerland, conferer.ee was outlined by
Leon Zolotokoff, grand master of the
Knights of Zion, who said that the idea
was to create a legally assured home for
the Jews and a refuge for Jews who can
not be assimilated by the people among
Â¦whom they now live. Said he: V -r\
Says He Will Not Exchange

"A short time ago I tasted some coffee
and found, to my astonishment, that I did
not care anything about it. I never have
to take Jive:: medicine any more. I" hope
you will use this letter for the benefit of
those suffering from thÂ«Â» poisonous effects
of coffee. I would gladly send to those

"Gradually I began to get better, and
week by week gained in strength and
health. Not I am In perfect condition,

of my troutle was from -coffee drinking,
and my. getting better was due to leaving
off coffee and taking Postum.
"However, husband brought home a
package of Postum Food Coffee . and it
was made strictly according to directions.
It wss the only thing that would stay on

very much.
"Finally I got down so sick with catarrh

that if I did not give up drinking coffee I
would surely "die. but I felt I could not

Old King Coffee knocks subjects out tol-

ble doubt of what did it. A lady gives her
experience: "I used to have liver trouble
nearly all of the time acd was compelled
to take some liver medicine like calomel,
which relieved me only for a little while.

A bill to provide " a commission to select a
site and secure plans for a memorial arch In
honor of William McKinley, late President of
the United States, to be erected in the District
Of Columbia.-
Be it enacted, etc.: That the chairman of
the Joint Committee on the Library, the Secre
tary of State and the Secretary of "War be. and
are hereby, created a commission â¢ to select a
site and procure plans and designs 'for a me
morial arch in honor of William McKinley,
late President of the United States.
Section 2. That said commission Is-author
ized to select any unoccupied land belonging
to the United States in the District of Colum
bia, except the grounds of the Capitol and the
Library of Congress, on which to erect the
said memorial arch.
Section 3. That said commission is author
ized and required to obtain, by any form of
competition which may seem advisable.' plans,
specifications and models for said memorial
provided' for * In section 1, and may pay for
the same to competing artists not exceeding
J25.000, which sum "la hereby appropriated out
of any money In the treasury not otherwise
appropriated. The said commission' may select
any of the plans, specifications or models that
It may prefer, or any part of them.
Section 4. That as soon as practicable after
the selections authorized 'by sections 2 and 3
are made said commission shall report â¢ Its
action to the Congress of the United States.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5.â The William
McKinley National Memorial Arch Asso
ciation | has drafted the following bill,
which will.be introduced in Congress this
week and be supported ' by a petition
signed by the members of the association
and also by the members of the McKinley
National Memorial Association, formed to
erect a monument in Canton, to which the
arch association yielded the field of popu
lar subscription: :i .
priate Money for a Tribute to
McKinley.
Congress Will Be Asked to Appro-
BILL FOR MEMORIAL
ARCH IN WASHINGTON
â¢.WASHINGTON, Jan. 5.â After a recess
of almost three weeks both houses of
Congress will reconvene to-morrow. The
principal item on the House programme
for the week is the Hepburn isthmian ca
nal bill, which is the special order for
Tuesday. No limit has been fixed as to the
time for debate upon the measure, but
Hepburn does not expect a prolonged dis
cussion. It is surmised in some quarters,
however, that if the proposition of the
Panama Canal Company to sell Its prop
erty and franchises for 540,000,000 should
be made - to-morrow, as promised, this
may have the effect of opening a wider
field of discussion than at first seemed
probable, and if this should prove to be
the case the bill may be before the House
for a longer time than is now expected.
/ Burton has given notice of a speech on
the bill, -and it is understood that there
will be other speeches in criticism of spe
cial features of the measure; but its
friends are very sanguine, not only that
the bill will pass but tnat It will pass
speedily. . .
It is expected that by the time the canal
bill Is disposed of there will be one or
more, appropriation bills ready for consid
eration by the House. None of the appro
priation .bills have yet been passed on by
the Appropriations Committee, but both
the urgent deficiency and the pension bills
are in a forward state and the expecta
tion is that they will be considered by
the committee during the current week.
The present intention Is to give first at
tention to the deficiency bill. The esti
mates for that bill aggregate $12,000,000.
and It is not believed that these figures
will be scaled down materially.
Â¦ The Senate has no programme for the
week and very little business on its cal
endar, as the reorganization of the Senate
committees did not take place until Just
before the holidays. There are, however,
a few bridge bills reported and Senator
Morgan's bill for the acquisition of right
of way for the Nicaragua canal is arrlong
the measures in a position to receive at
tention. It is not probable that the- rieht
of way bill will receive consideration at
this time, the disposition being rather to
await the action of the' House upon the
general subject, and then have the Senate
predicate its action In the House bill. If
this course should be decided on the dis
cussion of the canal question in the Sen
ate will be postponed for a few weeks.
The Committee on the Philippines will
take up the Philippine tariff question
very soon, but there is yet no indication
as to hoV much time the question may
consume in committee. Hence there is
no probability that the Senate Itself will
be able to reach that question for some
time.
Senator Frye Is engaged on his report on
the shipping bill, but la not yet able to fix
the time for its completion.-

HONOLULU, Dec. 28.â Circuit Judge
Kalua of the Second Circuit, Island
of Maul, Is now the subject of charges
preferred with a view to having him re
moved. Kalua is ' accused of miscpnduct
in many ways, including drunkenness on
the bench, undue familiarity with defend
ants appearing before him and utter Ig
norance Â¦ and Incompetence. ~ -The Maui
News states that Â¦ the Judge's charges to
Grand Juries and Instructions to trial
juries are prepared by subordinate of
ficers of his court, and that the truth of
the accusations on which his removal is
demanded is a matter of common Â¦ noto
riety. Kalua Is warmly criticized by some
lawyers on account of some recent rulings
by him, and it is stated .that if he does
not resign efforts will be made to secure
his removal and specific charges will be
preferred.

was continued on the same lines over the
makeup of the standing committees, and
it is evident that the chairmanships and

the offices. Price, who was defeated for

v With some men It Is either a case of get

What Is wanted In the' person of Mr. . Roose
velt and in every other person whom the
twentieth century may see in the White House
is a President who will be allowed to serve
the whole people with all his heart and
strength, with all his mind and body, Hi the
discharge of his official duties, unhindered by
the pressure upon him of so . many - thousands
of his countrymen as have in recent years en
croached upon the time and patience of our
Presidents and kept them from their public
work, or compelled them to do it by impairing
their physical health and overstraining their
mental powers. , The time has come when ac
cess to the President, except at public recep
tions, should be llmlte'd to the Cabinet Minis
ters, Senators, Representatives and Embassa
dorsand to such other persons only as are
given interviews for public purposes after
written applications have been received and
carefully considered. The public receptions of
the President should be few, and there should
be no Intrusion upon his social life, which he
should be allowed to regulate according to his
own- will -and pleasure, and no person should
take offense because not invited to his presence
or find fault with his selection of his company,
whatever may be its race or. color. Â¦ ,
This needed change of custom will at first,
no doubt, be unpopular. I It will be condemned
as unrepubllcan exclusiveness." It will require,
to begin the new rule, a President who has
been a man of the people, who Is known to be
at heart thoroughly democratic in his ideas
and ways, and who is also strong in his con
victions and fearless in his actions. Is not Mr.
Roosevelt such a President? Will he Inaugu
rate the reform?
Chandler cites from personal knowledge
the cases of Presidents who have almost
succumbed under .the strain, instancing
particularly President Arthur, ! in whose
Cabinet ' he was Secretary of the Navy,
and President McKinley, to .whose" Im
paired health Chandler attributes inability
to recover from- the shock from the . as
sassin's bullet. Chandler expresses his
regret -that President ;Ropsevelt, "even
with his quickness, his acuteness and his
present untiring industry and energy, has
given countenance to the idea that he will
do all the appointing himself and hear all
that any one has to say concerning any
appointment." â¢ - Â¦ Â¦. .
Chandler thinks that the great weight
of the pressure for office ought to fall
upon the Cabinet Ministers, and that the
President ought to have more time for
important things. He 'continues: ;
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5.â The Washing
ton Post to-day prints an interesting and
important article by ex-Senator William
E. /Chandler, president of the Spanish
Claims Commission, entitled "Wanted, by
the United Statesâ a President." The arti
cle is a strong argument for a reform in
the present methods of conducting execu
tive business. Chandler asserts . that a
President has now only three objects in
his lifeâ first, to see 20,000 persons a year;
second, to accomplish ZOM little things, and
third, to try to do 200 great things. In the
seeing of so many thousands about trivial
matters and in giving his attention to the
thousands of little things,. the President,
Chandler insists, is worn out and becomes
physically unable' to grapple with the
great problems to which he ought to give
his undivided attention. . . . ' .--Â¦'. \ V

The vessel had been afloat nearly, two
n^ S :* h^ rl , nj ?, d J ifted northward almost
opposite Trinidad, a coast town eighteen
miles north of Eureka. The green rollers
breaking over the Eureka while she was
in a crippled condition caused much fear
among â¢ the passengers. Sherdocked ar
Baird-street wharf, Eureka, at 4:15 p. ni
having been on the voyage over twentv
nine hours the time required to make rhe
trip being from eighteen to twenty hourb
During the trip a constant lookout was
kept for missing rafts and lifeboats yet
unaccounted for that were lowered from*
the wrecked Walla Walla. Several pieces
of wreckage were seen floating, but no
other object whatever was sighted. . To
date every -vessel reaching this port' has
seer, nothing of the French bark which
collided with the steamer Walla Walla
The passengers on board feel most
grateful toward Captain Killman, com
mander of a four-masted schooner' now
docked at Somoa, being loaded with lum
ber for foreign ports. He observed the
mate giving orders, but making no head
way toward controlling the ship. He then
took it upon himself to order the crew
and the mate undertook to interfere. Cap
tain Killman replied: "I do not intend
placing my life in your hands one minute
longer.
EUREKA, Jan. 5.â The steamer Eureka
in command of Captain Jessen, which left
San Francisco at 11 a. m. Saturday, with
twenty-one passengers aboard, met with
an accident while on the Humbold't Bar
that might have resulted in the loss of
several lives. Upon entering the bar a
large green' roller hit her stern, disabling
the steering gear by breaking the wire
rope near the rudder post. While dis
abled and drifting on the bar she barely
missed the north-end jetty. If the steamer
had struck the Jetty it would have cap
sized and probably all aboard would have
been lost. By the use of the propeller
the crew managed to keep the vessel head
on the green rollers untilshe drifted back
to sea. - . .
i Snecial Dispatch to The Call,
The weather has been below freezing
point, but this does not seem to have any
effect on the mosquitoes, except, perhaps,
to make them more ravenous. They have
even invaded dwellings. Residents have
never seen anything like them. Local
naturaiists say they are different from
ordinary mosquitoes, and are at a loss to
classify them accurately.
The mosquitoes arrived when the snow
eras deep upon the ground. They came in
a cloucU like grasshoppers, and settled
everywhere. The appearance of a living
being is a signal for them to swarm to
the attack In myraids. They are t>o large
and fierce that they can be fought off with
difficulty. People have been forced to re
nuiin indoors as much as possible and
women â and even some men â have taken
to wearing veils when they apepar on the
streets.
fiALINA. Utah, Jan. 5.â A swarm of
mosquitoes had descended upon Sallna and
is making all manner of trouble for the
inhabitants. The phenomenon is a re
markable one, for mosquitoes have never
been heard of in winter in this part of
the country, and these mosquitoes are as
large as wasps.
EDecial Diesatch to The Call
Mr. and Mrs. Collier play the ardent lov
ers in "On the Quiet." Mrs. Collier said
this morning, when the story leaked out,
that her contract compelled her to stay
with the company. . â¢
Before she left the Brown Palace Mrs.
Collier told the clerk she would return
immediately to New York to obtain a di
vorce. An attorney yesterday gathered
evidence regarding the assault upon her.
Mrs. Collier bore marks of blows on her
.tece. Across her nose, near the right
eye. was a long cut, apparently made by
a ring stone. Her right eye was discol
ored and her cheeks were puffed red
swollen.
When Mrs. Collier had- dressed Watch
man Brady called a carriage and she was
taken to the St. James Hotel, where she
remained the rest of the week with Mrs.
Garrett.
Earlier in the evening Mrs. Collier en
tertained a party of four or five friends,
among whom were her sister, Mrs. Gar
rett, and the latter's husband, Thomas
Garrett.
"I Just came home a few minutes ago
.to have a cold bottle of beer. You can
see what they've been drinking," he
added, with a wave of the hand toward
a number of wine bottles, on the floor.
DENVER, Jan. 5.â Guests in the Brown
Palace Hotel were awakened shortly be
fore 3 o'clock on Thursday morning by
the shrieks and sobs of a woman. The
cries came from the corridor of the third
story and attracted the attention of Night
Clerk Brown. Watchman Brady found
Mrs. William Collier, wife of the actor,
crouched in a corner of the corridor. She
was clad in only a night robe, but had
thrown a skirt around her shoulders.
Brady rapped at Collier's door and was
ordered away, but threatened to break
in the door if it were not opened. Actor
Collier opened the door.- Brady told him
to allow Mrs. Collier to get her clothing.
Collier said:

HALIFAX, N.. S., Jan. 5.â The British
troop ship Manhattan arrived this even
ing from Cape Town. On board the troop
ship were two Americans who fought un
der the. British flag in the South African
war. One of them! T. Ryan, served two
years with the Duke of Edinbm-gh's colo
nial corps. He took part In eight en
gagements, the most important of which
was the relief of Kimberley. His home is
in Arizona and he is going to New Or
leans. The Manhattan will take part of
the Canadian Mounted Rifles to South
Africa.
PRETORIA, Jan. 5.â The Boers /* am
bushed a party of i the Scots Guards last
Sunday near Bronkhortspruit, about forty
miles east of Pretoria, on the railroad.
The British casualties were six men killed
and ten wounded.
The Cannons are leading citizens, and
practically the only, ones in the Lookout
country, who have openly and persistently
favored the prosecution of the suspects.
They declare that Nichols had nothing to
do with the lynching.
. One of the alleged' discrepancies in the
confession of John Hutton is the state
ment that R. L. Nichols, a cousin of the
Cannons of Lookout, joined the town par
ty of lynchers in the rear of Trowbridge's
store and went with it to the schoolhouse
reaching the schoolhouse at 11 o'clock
and remaining there until the country
party arrived, when the mob repaired to
the hotel and lynched the five prisoners
Nichols" was one of the men who guard
ed the prisoners early in the night, and
claims he did not go. off duty until after
12 o'clock. â¢
. After Gibbons Sr. had finished his depo
sition a boy named Halcomb called him
from the courtroom and escorted him to
the hotel. Gibbons returned .in a- few
minutes and, asked that his deposition be
returned to him, saying that he believed
the defense was trying to take advantage
of him.. His. request was denied.
: The Alturas Plain Dealer to-day Issued
an extra detailing the events of the last
two days and charging that two witnesses
who have made confessions were hypno
tized by Simmons. ._
Deponent Tries to "Hedge."
J. Oliver Gibbons in his deposition said
that he had arranged the interview as
requested. Judge Myers expressed a
willingness to see Post and Simmons.
Later the deponent saw Myers and Mar
shal Taylor going up the street together
in the direction of Stewart's Hall. After
ward Myers told him that he had gone
to see Simmons and that Simmons told
him the prosecution had evidence that he
tied those knots, and that if he would
make a confession Â¦ he would be freed
Myers declared that he told all he knew
before the Grand Jury and the Superior
Court, and that if he added anything else
it would be perjury.
Gibbons Sr. said that yesterdafy after
noon he was accosted by Simmons near
the Star Hotel and was requested to tell
his son, J. Oliver Gibbons, that Assistant
Attorney General Post would like to ar
range for an interview with Judge Myers.
Simmons also asked him to have his son
take a doctor to the jail and to have the
doctor certify that It was not a fit place
in- which, to confine Myers. Simmons
wanted the aged Judge brought to the ho
tel, where he could be taken care of for
the night. Later in -the day Simmons
went to Gibbons' house and told Gibbons
that Myers would not make any state
ment and would not acknowledge that he
had tied the -knots in the ropes tested in
Morris' store in Lookout. He again asked
Gibbons to have- his son bring Myers to
Â¦the hotel and urge him to make a confes
sion, Simmons claimed Myers had ad
mitted the facts in his presence, but that
he' refused to confess to the attorneys
for the State. .
The warrant for Simmons' arrest was
sworn out late this afternoon after sev
eral depositions had been taken before
Justice of the Peace Spargur. Those ex
amined before Judge Spargur were T. C
Gibbons, an evangelist residing in Red
Bluff, and. his son, J. Oliver Gibbons, a
resident of Lookout. J. Oliver Gibbons is
a son-in-law of Judge Myers, and it is
upon the latter that Simmons is alleged
to have tried to use hypnotic Influence to
obtain a confession.
Accusations Against Simmons.
_ Justice of the Peace J. R. Myers of
Lookout declares that he has given no
statement regarding the lynching, except
that made on the witness stand, when
he declared that he knew nothing regard
ing the hanging of Hall and the others.
Rev. Mr. Simmons was closeted with him
until a. late hour last night and it was
expected that as the result of the impor
tunities of the clergyman ,the aged sus
pect would tell what he knew. Myers is
near death, and it is believed that he will
soon relent and turn against those with
whom he is believed to have been asso
ciated in the lookout tragedy.
Deputy Sheriff Fleming arrived here
this evenings from Lookout with Orrin
Trowbridge and J. J. Potter and placed
them in jail. These are two of the men
implicated by the confession of Hutton.
All of the thirteen suspects are now in
jail here.. It is. expected that other in
dictments will be returned to-morrow.
It was learned definitely to-day that,
despite the protestations of Claude Mor
ris that he had made no confession, hl3
sworn statement detailing events in con
nection with' the lynching is In the'pos
session of the prosecution. The confes
sion of Morris was obtained by Mr. Sim
mons. : .
In connection with the arrest of Rev.
Mr. Simmons there is a peculiar story.
He claims to possess some hypnotic pow
er, and the Alturas populace has come
to believe that Hutton was induced to
confess not through appeals to his relig
ious feeling, but because of the hypnotic
influence exercised over him by Mr. Sim
mons. Â¦Â¦' Â¦
ALTURAS, Jan. 1 . 5.â Rev. Mr. Simmons,
the clergyman through whom the con
fession of John Hutton, Implicating many
alleged participants in the Lookout lynch
ing, was obtained, was arrested to-night
on a warrant sworn to by men connected
with the defense in the Brown trial. He
is charged with subornation of perjury. Â¦
