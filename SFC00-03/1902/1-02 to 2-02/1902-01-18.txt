% The State of Guerrero has always been the focus of seismic
disturbances. Reports received here state that the shock was
very severe at Chillapa. No casualties are so far reported from
there.
The duration of the Chilpancingo shock was less than that
in Mexico City, having lasted fifty seconds against fifty-five sec
onds at the capital
Up to 1 1 o'clock to-night no further news had come from
Chilpancingo. The eartHtmake was also intense at Iguala. in
the State of Guerrero; .destroying the parish church and many
buildings in the cityjari'd [neighborhood. Among the latter was
the sugar mill of Gerierj,%Frist>ie, an American. The mill had
just been completed am^fitted, up with American machinery at
a cost of $200,00. The property loss is immense throughout
the State of Guerrero:; >
SHOCK VERY SEVERE AT CHILPANCINGO.
The number of deaths was greater in . the parish church
than in 1 any other place, as a crowd of worshipers was gathered
there for the afternoon service. The solid masonry walls and
the roof fame toppling down on the worshipers and many of
those within were killed.
The War Department has ordered troops in the neighbor
hood to co-operate in the work. of rescue. Until this work is
completed it will be '..impossible Jo^ accurately learn th*e number
of victims. r ''
It is believed, however, that this is one of the most destruc
tive seismic phenomena that has occurred in Mexico. The
greater part of the population of Chilpancingo are now camp
ing out under tents around the town, which is five days* jour
ney from the national capital:
Earthquake shocks were felt in many other cities and
towns. In Mexico City the earthquake occurred at 5:17 o'clock
yesterday afternoon and was of such violence as to shake the
most substantial buildings. The Pan-American Congress was in
session at the time and many of the delegates were greatly
alarmed. The first movement here was one of trepidation and
was very sharp. It was followed by an easy, oscillatory move
ment north-northeast to south-southwest. The duration was
fifty-five seconds. The damage in this city was slight.
MANY MEET DEATH WHILE AT CHURCH.
MEXICO CITY, Jan. 17.â One of the most terrible
catastrophes in the history of the State of Guerrero is
reported to have occurred late yesterday afternoon,
when an. extremely violent earthquake shock was felt
at Chilpancingo, causing a great loss of life and injuring many
persons. Details from the stricken district are very meager,
but scattering reports received here indicate that probably 300
persons were killed and as many more injured. It is known
that, the State capitol, the parish church and many business
houses and residences are in ruins, and that there is much suf
fering as a result of the awful seismic disturbance.
â¢ One of the edifices that suffered most was the Federal tele
graph office, which explains the paucity of news that has so far
reached this city.
Meager details, finally began to arrive here. The telegraph
lines and , apparatus at Chilpancingo were badly damaged, but
the employes, all of whom were 'uninjured, quickly proceeded
to erect an improvised telegraph office on the outskirts of the

Lampre, secretary general of the French
company, who assured the commission
that there was not the slightest ground
for any dispute as to title or for any liti
gation in behalf of the stockholders of
the old Panama company.
In addition to this, a statement was
sent in from the State Department that
assurances of the most emphatic char
acter had been given to Secretary Hay
by Minister Silva of the United States
of Colombia that his Government as soon,
as the canal was transferred to the
United States would enter into negotia

States could proceed with the work, and
under which it could own, operate and

over the territory on which the canal is
constructed.

All the statements apparently con
vinced the commission that there wouM
be no difficulty in the future to impair
the title of the Government to the canal.
The commission also decided that the mi

by the United States any more than they
were able to hamper the building of tha
canal by French capital.

â After a session which lasted
the entire day and until nearly
midnight the Isthmian Canal
Commission has adjourned until
to-morrow, having practically completed
its supplemental report. The report will
be typewritten and signed by the nine
Commissioners to-morrow, after which it
will be placed in the hands of President
Roosevelt, who will send it to Congress
Â¦without delay.
The report, it is understood, is In favor
of the acceptance by the United States of
the offer of the Panama Canal Company
to sell for 540,000,000. This sum, it is un
derstood. Is to pay for practically every
thing the canal company has on the isth

Hanpt Iieads the Opposition.
From the first a majority of the com
mission has favored the Panama route if
the Panafea company could be induced
to sell for a sum approaching $40,000,000,
but there was at the meeting yesterday
and to-day a strong and active minority
headed by Professor Louis M. Haupt of
Philadelphia. It was desired by the com
mission to avoid presenting two reports.
All previous reports have been made by
the entire commiFsion, and Admiral "Wal

effort to keep this record unbroken.
The most important thing to be decided
by the commission to-day was the legal
ity of the title which the Panama com

States. The commission, in addition to
questioning the owners of the minority

Government Leader Balfour Says the

LONDON, Jan. 17.â A. J. Balfour, the

tions In regard to the reference in the re
cent speech of the German Imperial
Chancellor, Count yon Bulow, to assur
ances received by Germany on the sub
ject of the utterances at Edinburgh of
Chamberlain, the Colonial Secretary.
Balfour declared that no assurances
had been officially asked for by Germany,
but that In unofficial conversation Lord
Lansdowne, the Foreign Secretary, had
pointed out to the German Embassador
that Chamberlain ' had made no charges
of barbarity against the German or any
other army. In the opinion of the Gov

The,, writ of prohibition by - which thfe
County Clerk seeks protection runs only
against officers exercising judicial powers,
and only when they exceed their Juris
diction. The writ of prohibition is asked
for on the ground that a municipal officer
cannot interfere -with- the tenure of a
county officer, and also on the ground
that If the County Clerk committed a fel
ony his offense occurred before he' took
office and that therefore he cannot be
interfered with in possession of his office
by the Mayor's power.
"It will be maintained on the part of
the Mayor that both of these contentions
are unsound; not that the Mayor has any
interest in the controversy, but he will
not shirk the performance of his duty and
he. does not want to be unwarrantly inter
fered With in the discharge of the func
tions of his office. It is his duty to main
tain the charter and all of its provisions,
especially those sections which in the in
terest of the public good give him super
vision over the actions and conduct of
other officials of the municipality. As I
understand the Mayor's position he would
have willingly absolved himself from the
disagreeable duty of considering the grave
charges made agaibst the County Clerk.
But being compelled to proceed in justice
to the people of the municipality who
elected him to office Mayor Schmitz pro
poses to do his full duty to the end. what
ever may be his conclusions after careful
deliberation. , Therefore he will maintain
that under section 8^4 of article II of the
constitution of the State and under . the
provisions of the charter the people of
both the. State and city have vested ' in
him the power to suspend for cause any
officer of the city Â¦who draws his salary
from the city and county of San Francisco
and exercises his powers entirely within
the city, whether he be county -officer or
not. : : Â¦ . -.
"And parenthetically it may be suggest
ed that If the County Clerk is purelv a'
county officer he should not be performing
such strictly municipal duties as clerk of
the Police Court. Â¦ To be consistent with
his contention that he. is' not a municipal
officer, he should decline to appoint depu
ties to serve as deputy, clerks of the-po
lice Courts.: '
"On: the second point, .that concedln.se
the Mayor's Jurisdiction 1^ suspend county
"The Mayor undoubtedly has the right
and power to act. and it is for him and
him alone to decide whether the charges
are . of sufficient gravity to invoke his
power or his action."
officials said jurisdiction cannot be exer
cised by him for acts committed before
the official's induction Into office, hardly
more than a suggestion is necessary to
brush away this ridiculously absurd con
tention. The argument made in behalf of
the County Clerk would be equally effica
cious If it had been discovered that prior
to his assuming the duties of his office
and while acting in hia former capacity
as Deputy County Clerk he had appro
priated to use public money coming Ir.to
his hands as such an officer. His election
as County Clerk would certainly not have
condoned such a crime. No more woulcl
his election ate County Clerk condone any
other felony, even such a felony as the
one charged against him. I do not wish
to be understood to be making any com
ments concerning the County Clerk's cul
pability or Innocence, ror that is not with
in my province or desire. My whole atten
tion in this matter is directed to the legal
aspect of the situation, and as to that
my opinion is unequivocal.
"If the position maintained by the
County Clerk were to be sustained by Â«*ny
court_the result might be disastrous to
the welfare of the city, /or It would follow
as a matter of. logical conclusion that if
the County Clerk from day to day wera
to falsify records or be guilty of other
acts of corruption , there would be no of
ficial who would have the power to sum
marily remove him.

Following are the essential portions of
Mahony's complaint:
Plaintiff avers: . Â¦
That this plaintiff has not been found guilty
of malfeasance or misfeasance in office, and
has not done or committed any act in violation
of any law of the United States, .or any law
of the State of California, or any' law or or

That within three days last past, at said
city and county of San Francisco, the said
Mayor, without authority of law, and without
any Jurisdiction so to do, and in excess of
Jurisdiction, has wrongfully and unlawfully
entertained and proceeded to hear an alleged
cause of complaint against this defendant for
an alleged violation of what is known as the
purity of elections law, alleged to have been
committed by this plaintiff at a time anterior
to the date of his nomination by the nom
inating convention of the Republican party yi
the city and county of San Francisco for the
office of County Cterk of said city and County;
that for the purpose of entertaining and hear
ing :aid complaint, the said defendant as such
Mayor has wrongfully and unlawfully assumed
the Jurisdiction and right to subpena wit
nesses and take testimony, and hay in fact sub
penaed witnesses and taken testimony, and said
defendant as such Mayor as aforesaid, with
out any Jurisdiction so to do, and in exeets
of Jurisdiction, .wrongfully and unlawfully has
submitted the matter of said complaint al
leged against this plaintiff to himself for de
cision, although, as hereinbefore stated, . the
said defendant as such Mayor is absolutely
devoid of Jurisdiction to. entertain or hear said
pretended complaint against said plaintiff, or
to act thereon.
Attorney Riordan had his order and so
proceeded in a more sedate fashion.
Ushered into the presence of Mayor
Schmitz the attorney said:
"Good morning. Mayor. I have a little
surprise for youâ a wjlt of prohibition re
straining you from further acticfi against
the Countv Clerk."
"Well, I have a little surprise for you,"
replied the Mayor. "Anticipating your
bad faith in this matter I have already
reached a decision and have suspended
County Clerk Mahony."
It was the attorney's turn to be aston
ished and for a time he thought his game
was up. But by inquiry he learned that
notice of Mahony's suspension had not
been placed on record, and from a state
bordering on hysteria Riordan settled
down Into the calm frame of mind of the
politician-lawyer who feels that sharp
practice has given him an advantage over
an opponent. |

TvXTTnUTlVM COMMITTEE ACTS.
Resolutions Adopted as to Opening
'and Closing of the Fair.
ST. LOUIS, Jan. 17.â The following reso
lutions were unanimously passed at a
meeting of the executive committee of
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition Com
pany this evening, to set at rest state
ments coming' from "Washington to the
effect that the "World's Fair might have
to be postponed from 1903 until 1904:
"Whereas. The . public press has agi
tated the question of postponement of
the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, be It
"Resolved. That under the act of Con
gress and under every plan of the board
of directors and executive committee, the
exposition will open and close In the year
1903." .
The bill will promote the of new

the Halifax award In 1K7R. For eev-ntv years
the United States paid bounties to deep-sea
fishermen. The President of the UnitedState^
has general supervision of regulations to en
force the act.
Americans have absolute free trade in for
eign-going ships, so no shipbuilders' trust Is
possible under the bill. Shipbuilders can im
port now free of duty materials for ships for
foreign trade, so no man can raise prices of
materials. If any American Ehipowner will
build his vessel in the United States, employ
ing home labor, employing American officers
end crews, performing certain services for the
American Government and using the vessel to
promote American commerce, he will be naid
a subsidy sufficient to put him on an equality
with the foreign shipowner, employing foreign
labor and serving a foreign government.
The average cost of building iron steamers
mainly for cargo is $100 per ton in the United
States and $76 in Great Britain. Average
monthly wages on ocean steamers mainly for
cargo are: American, S36; British. $26- Ger
man and Scandinavian. $17. The general sub
sidies proposed equalize American and foreign
costs on these bases.
Advantages to Americans.
The second part of the report deals with
the general subsidy to all American vessels,
steam and sail, except mall eteamers. It
quotes President Roosevelt's message, show
ing that the cost of building American ships
is greater than the cost of building ships
abroad: mat American wages on shipboard are
higher, and that the House should remedy
these inequalities Discriminating duties, ex
port bounties and subsidies based on export
cargoes are in violation of our international
obligations, bo direct subsidies, it says is the
only practical method. The subsidy p'roposed
is not a naked bounty, for It is based on pub
lic services to be rendered.
Subsidy on Vessels.
The report compares in detail the American
services proposed with British service, and
asserts that the bill will revolutionise In Amer
ican favor, as against the Suez route, the
Â¦world's ocean mail connections with China and
Japan and will affect Australian connections
It will give the United States twenty-four
auxiliary mail cruisers, compared with Great
Britain's fifty.
The establishment of this complete American
ocean mail service, involving- much shipbuild
ing, will require several years. It Â¦will render
the United States as Independent of foreign
powers for its ocean mail service as is Great
Britain. The cost of the American service by
American mail steamers will be $4,700,000; the
cost of British and colonial service by British
steamers is $4,700,000. Receipts from ocean
postage by the United States are now esti
mated at $3,000,000. The annual deficit under
the American system proposed. Including minor
cervices, â¢will be about $2,000,000. The annual
deficit under the British colonial system is
S2.1SS.O00.
The postal subsidy provisions enable the
Postmaster General to establish an American
ocean mail system superior to the systems of
Great Britain, France and Germany. The
American ocean mall system outlined con
template* on the Pacific weekly mail services
to Hawaii, to Philippine Islands. Japan, China
and Hongkong and a fortnightly service to
Pago-Pago. New* Zealand and Australia. The
maximum cost would be $2,335,000. --
On the Atlantic the bill contemplates semi
weekly mall services to Jamaica, Havana and
Europe, weekly to Mexico, once in ten days
to Venezuela and fortnightly to Brazil at a
maximum cost of $2,305,000.
Summary of the Bill.
The report prepared by Sr-nntor Frjrc
was read to the committee. It says that
the purpose of the bill is to establish the
maritime supremacy of the United States
in trade with Asia, and In the Gulf of
Mexico and the Caribbean Sea; to estab
lish thoroughly trade between the United
States and South American republics,
and to give the United States a respecta
ble representation on the North Atlantic.
The claim is made that all those results
will be accomplished within ten years.
The report also asserts that the bill
â¢will fo extend shipbuilding as to trans
fer in time from abroad to the United
Stales the center of that industry, as the
centers of other industries recently have
been transferred, and also that it "will
give to the United-States a measure of
maritime independence corresponding to
cur industrial and agricultural indepen
dence. Senator Frye furnished to the
press the following summary of the re
port:
The committee made several amend

Dr. Ramsdell In commenting on catarrh cures
says: "I can heartily recommend Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets, because they contain no co-
caine nor other dangerous drug found In so
many advertised catarrh cures. I have known
of many cases of long standing catarrh of the
head and throat completely cured by tie dally
use of these tablets for several weeks. One
case In particular, which I could not reach
with an inhaler or spray and where the catarrh
caused daily headaches and a noticeable loss of
bearing, was entirely cured by this hsirmlesa
but effective remedy."
Dr. Walnwright says: "I never hesitate to
prescribe Stuart's Catarrh Tablets for catarrhal
headaches and catarrhal deafness becaasÂ«l
know them to be perfectly safe for child or
adult and have seen many remarkable cures
resulting from their regular daily use; because
they are advertised and sold in drug stores
is no reason why any good physician should not
usa them, because we should seize upon tÂ£Â«
means of cure wherever found." Â°
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets ara especially rain
able for catarrhal colds In children because
they are pleasant to the taste and may be usert
freely to break up severe colds and ctoud Â«t

During the examination of the witness
the prosecution, entered many objections
and on several occasions Raker interject

for the prosecution, remarked:

Boyd's remark brought a strong protest
from. the defense. Raker calling the at

and ungentlemanly words of , Boyd. The
court replied that he. did not hear the
remark . and Raker said that the court
always managed to hear his remarks, but
paid . no. attention to Â¦' the objectionable
remark of the prosecution. Tht= court re
plied that he' "wished to God that he

let. us proceed with this i case.
Spencer took up the cross-examination
of Witness Morris as to the movements
of the lynching party from the time .it
left the schoolhouse until after the lyncn
inÂ«r, when the mob unmasked and sepa
rated. Morris told a story substantially
the same as that related by John Hutton.
but his testimony showed that he- did
not pay as much attention to details on
tne night of the hanging as did Hutton.-
His testimony differed trom. Hutton s in
several unimportant points and he con
tradicted himself on several occasions.
Hutton testified that the wagon spokes
brought for the town party by the coun
try party â¢ were distributed at the school
house, but Morris said that they were
distributed at the hotel Just before the
lynching. Hutton said that the sack
used to conceal the ropes, gags and
spokes was afterward utilized as a mask
by one of the party. -Morris said that the
ropes were carried to the hotel in the
-sack. Morris testified that the lynching
party marched from the schoolhouse to
the hotel in twos. Hutton said that they
walked in no set order. Hutton told the
jury that, he and Morris were the, first to
leave the hotel with the young Wilson
boy, whom they prepared for tne lynch
ing, but Morris said that Frank Hall, ono
of the victims, ' was the first to leave 'the
hotel. Morris testified that. Daniel Yan
tls was the first â¢ man hanged, and that
the men who hanged him assisted Morris
and H utton in hanging . young , \ Wilson.
Later in the day, in 'answer, to 'a question
by Spencer, Morris said that Frank Hall
was the flrst i man hanged. The defense
noticed the contradiction and shortly be
fore adjournment asked Morris if he de
sired to j make any corrections, but tho
prosecution objected and Morris did not
reply.
. Morris testified to one point that Hutton
neglected in his testimonyâ the fact ; that
after old . man Hall was hanged several
shots were . nred by some one near 'the
hotel and that some of the lynching party
fired shots Â¦while on the. bridge. Morris
explained that he did not hear all that
was passing on that night, because a
fever had rendered his hearing faulty.
Spencer questibned Morris as to his tes
timony before the Grand Jury, asking
him- if Â¦ he did not mask when testifying
before that body to illustrate a certain
point in his testimony. The prosecution
made a strong objection, asking how the
defense had discovered what Morris had
testified to before the Grand Jury.' Ra
ker replied:.
"We want to impeach the testimony of
this witness, and it's nobody's business
where we I got our information as to his
testimony ' before the Grand Jury. We'
will bring the Grand. Jury before the
court." . " . ' ' . , - Â¦
"You call every witness who gets into
this chair a liar,", exclaimed , Judge â¢ Har
rington. "You get more rumors than any
one I ever saw. You are a monomaniac
on impeachment." * ''"''Â¦ i Â¦ Â¦ Â¦>' '<
; "With exception to the remarks of the
court," retorted Raker. - .
The questioning of the witness as to
his testimony before the Grand Jury re
sulted; in several rows. â¢,-Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
Evidence accumulates that a gross er
ror has occurred in the surveys some
where and that the sporting association's
rnansicn is built a quarter of a mile from
its preverves and on Indian land -which
cannot under the law be acquired by pur

command meet the North-German Lloyd
steamer Kronprinz at Tompkinsville. at
which point the Princ? will be transferred
to the Hohenzollern. and the n?val pro
cession will steam up the bay. . .
Two plans are under consideration for
the transportation of the party to Shoot

One is to have the President meet Prince
Henry at the Battery in New York,
where the party will board a United States
Government vessel and proceed down the
bay to the island, nine miles distant
Â¦Another is to have the President's car g6
over the Baltimore and Ohio Rairoad as
far as Newark Bay, where it will be
switched on to the long trestle and the
party embarked on one of the shipbuild
ing firm's, boats. The ship yard is only
three-quarters of a mile distant from this
trestle. - . .".
William Wallace Downey, a member of
the firm building Emperor William's
yacht, called at the White House to-day,
and after discussing -with President
Roosevelt the details of the approaching
launching went to the State Department
and talked over the details of the pro
gramme with Assistant Secretary Hill,
Admiral Evans and Admiral Crownin
shield. It was decided that the. launch
shall occur at 10:30 a, m., February 25.
Pressure is being brought to bear by
nearly all the large cities of the coun
try to secure the presence therein of
Prince Henry and the present indications
are that, after the conclusion of, the
launching ceremonies, the Prince will
make a rapid tour through the country,
going as far west, perhaps, as St. Louis.
In case this plan is executed the itinerary
probably will : be arranged to allow the
Prince to see the American cities having
the largest population of Germanic ex
traction.
Rapid Tour of Cities.
It was decided that all arrangements
for Prince Henry's reception shall be con
fided to a special committee, composed of
Dr. David Jayne Hill, representing the
State Department; Major General Henry
C. Corbin, representing the United States
army; Rear Admiral Robley, D. Evans,
representing the navy, and Count A. von

gineer corps will assist General Cbrbin in
the execution of; the' details. ; - . v j & ', .:
Some embarrassment in the preparation
of plans is caused .i>y the fact that the
day following Prince Henry's arrival at
JCew York ' will . be Sunday. It â¢will prob
ably not be deemed well for the Prince
and his party to travel on Sundayâ hence
he cannot start for Washington on that
day to pay his visit to President Roose
velt.
When the Prince reaches Washington
he will become the guest of the German
Embassador. According to precedent, it
will be the duty of the Prince to call upon
the President, who will- return the visit.
A. dinner will be given at the White
House in the Prince's honor.
Upon the arrival of Prince Henry in
Kew York he will be met by a squadron
under the command of Rear Admiral
Evans and national salutes of twenty-one
guns will be fired both by the warships
and by the shore batteries. Visits of
courtesy will be made upon the Prince
by the commander of the Department of
the East and the ranking- naval officer at
New York, and Assistant Secretary of
State Hill will also formally welcome the
Prince as the special representative of the
President. . : -.r

WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.â The time oj
the Cabinet meeting was largely occupied
in the discussion of the formalities to be
followed upon the occasion of the visit
of Prince Henry of Prussia. It is the de
sire of the President to show the Prince
every honor befitting him as a Prince of
the royal blood and as the personal rep
resentative and kinsman of the . German
Emperor. But at the same time the pro
gramme is to be as simple as possible.-
Precedents in the case of the visits of

r'.n the life of the late John Julius Martin,
a well known pioneer of this county, was
A filed in the Superior Court to-day by two
daughters by a former marriage.
The papers relate the leaving of hia
home by the old pioneer and the parting
with his family in North Carolina, the
finding of 'wealth in the Golden State, the
forgetting of a wife and family Â¦ who
avaited his return and his subsequent
marriage. After a reasonable time Mar
tin's whereabouts was unknown and as
he failed to send any money his wife be
gan action for divorce and was finally
granted a decree of separation. The
property In question Is said to be worth
over $500,000.
The plaintiffs in the suit are Emma R.
Mcore and Susan E. Spragrins, daughters
of the late pioneer, and the defendants
are Arzeiia J. Lewis, Julia F. Hornbeck,
Charles Hornbeck, Georgia A. Johnson,
Martha A. Oldham. A. Philbrook, Susan
M. Philbrook. Mary Tuliy and T\ . R.

property with funds earned after his
marriage to Nancy K. Dalton, the mother
of the plaintiffs, in North Carolina in 1833.
In 1553 Mrs. Martin, failing to hear from
>er husband, obtained a divorce on the
ground of desertion. Xo decree of a dlvi-
Flon of the property was made at the
time, as Mrs. Martin did not know where
her husband was and never learned his
â¢whereabouts during her lifetime. The
daughters declare that it was not until
three years ago that they knew where
their father was. They declare their
father purposely withheld all knowledge

Judge York of Los Angeles
"3; Refuses a Decree to Mrs.
Valenzuela.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 17.-Judge York
of the Superior Court to-day handed
down a decision in the divorce case of
Ramona Valenzuela against Arnulfa
Valenzuela, denying the application for
legal separation. The decision Is an Im
portant one in that It elaborates more In
detail Judge York's stand upon the ques
tion of obtaining a divorce because of
idleness on the part of the husband and
the consequent burden of support falling:
upon the shoulders of the wife. Last
summer Judge York made certain re
marks on this subject that were . widely
commented upon. The Valenzuela. deci
sion is in part as follows:
This action is prosecuted by the plaintiff on
the ground of willful neglect, by reason of de
fendant's idleness. The testimony of the plain
tiff shows that the defendant, t>y reason of hi*
idleness, has never provided plaintiff with a
home except with his parents and has never
supported her, but that the plaintiff Â«ver since
the marriage has been a w&geworker, haa
earned sufficient to support herself and has
laid up money for her future wants.
The question presented is: Can & wife Ob
tain a decree of divorce because of the hus
band's failure to support her on account of his
idleness, when she herself is a wageworker and
earning more' than sufficient to support her
self?
The court's sympathy goes out to a wtfa with
an Idle husband. Equally does the court's sym
pathy go out to a man who has an idle wife.
But be she ever so Idle, he cannot obtain from
her a divorce upon that ground. The idle are
the willing victims of profligacy and dissipa
tion. Selfishly does idleness fatten upon tha
fruits of others* labor. Idleness cannot be too
severely condemned. But for Idleness alone,
however much society may condemn it, we can
not divorce the wife from the husband any
' more than we can divorce the husband from
the wife on 'account of it.
In all walks of life woman baa shown her
ability to cope with men. The time has arrived
when we should look suspiciously upon her
claim to support from an idle husband, when
she la healthy and childless and more than his
equal In the battle of life. Heretofore the dis
tinction between Idleness and neglect caused
by Idleness has been the cause of the bringing
of many a groundless divorce suit. The plain
tiff in this case has asked for divorce on no
pther ground than that of willful neglect be
cause of the Idleness of her husband, and there
fore her prayer must be denied.
Plaintiff's attorneys declare they will
carry the case to the Supreme Court.

a boat, one rowing and the other trolling

idea. of allowing his. boat drift down
stream. He has been using fresh . roe
taken from fish caught In the stream. .
Some of the old v steelhead fishermen
spend much of their time instructing the
novices. One of their lessons has been
never to- touch the â¢ line when landing a
fish, as he always has a dying kick in
him. The proper way, they say, is to
"gaff" it or else catch : it under the gill
with the finger. When the fish Jumps out
Â°.f. tne water, in its desperate struggle for
liberty, the rod should be dipped. If the
line. Is then held taut the fish may strike
it /with its tall, cutting It as though it
were thread.

The death of Valley Queen, a greyhound
whose name will live in -history . of local
coursing, . has-, been .-recorded.- Valley
Queen was the dam of many celebrated
coursers, among which are Right Bower,
an untrained dog that won an open plains
stake In fast company, and Valley Maid
both by Dashaway. ,By Skyball sha
whelped Mialmo. a Merced winner,, and
Fireball. By Emln Pasha, Koolawn. a

'For Glory, and by Firm Friend, Royal
Anne and Â¦ May Hempstead, winners on
local fields.
The great annual coursing event of this
year, the Waterloo Cup of England, will
be run at Altcar next month. Greater in
terest is manifested in tn;s season's event
because of the quarantine against Irish
greyhounds having, been .removed by the
Board of Agriculture. This will bring out
many of the crack Irisn nounds, notwith
standing that many of the Irish leashmen
holding nominations in the classic event
gave them up expecting never to be al
lowed to course their hounds again in
England or Scotland. Fearless Footstep*,
twice winner of the cup, will be among the
entries, and is considered to have a great
chance to again win. Â¦â¢-
Two open stakes- are programmed for
this week's attraction for Union Park pa
trons. Both events will be run down on
Saturday. Likely winners in the first
event are Tlburon. Charta, Wild Norah,

The running of the Belle Brandon stake
serves as a preparatory trial for tfs great
California Futurity, an event that attracts
the attention of the entire coursing world.
Dogs that have performed successfully in
the Belle Brandon can be counted on to
enhance their reputation- in the Futurity.
: The- first meeting of the Belle Brandon
stake was held five years ago and waf
won by the courser whose name it bearrr.
Laurels in this annual event have beÂ«n
won by One Spot. Bohe; Freda C and
Freeze Out, in turn.
55 In "conjunction with this stake the Cali
fornia Plate stake of ninety-six entries
wilLbe run. This event, too. is a feature
of Â¦ the season's couraing, its. rich prize*
serving to attract the best performers in
the running. Greyhounds that are classed
as champions and by their clever work
earn favor in the eyes or coursing â¢ en
thusiasts are. being . trained carefully for
the California Plate stake. Their pres
ence in the event makes it second onlv to
the John Grace Challenge Cup stake,
America's greatest coursing meeting.
As soon as the hares show a disposition
to slacken in their speed the Union Park
management will run some sapling
stakes. The candidates in the Belle Bran
don event will" start in them to gain ex
perience on the field.
* The stake will be run on February ?2
and will be open for nominations until the
night of the draw.
The Belle Brandon stake Is scheduled
for thirty-two nominations. It is for
hounds the bona fide property of members
of the Interstate Coursing Club or any
coursing club represented on the Califor
nia Coursing Committee, the latter, how
ever, ' subject to the approval of the In
terstate club.'
Leashmen and breeders of high clays
greyhounds are looking forward with con
siderable interest to the running of this
year's Belle Brandon * taXe.
This meeting serves as an attraction to
the follower .of the game, inasmuch aa it
brings out 'a.' new. !ot;of coursers of hish
class. To the breeder it' gives the first
chancef to try the merits of hls"carefup
raised arid. ''fashionably 6 red puppies in an
Â«vent,set l .apart-"for .that class. That the
coming meeting will be of high'- class is
shown by the fact that already more than
the requisite number of entries have been
promised for the event , V
on it. It is " expected, when the club
acquires an anchorage right on the open
bay, so that the yachtsmen can begin
sailing as soon as they leave their moor
ings and can tie up at the close of a
cruise without having to sail for some dis
tance up the estuary, the club will largely
increase its membership.
The victory of Mrs. R. Gllman Brown
In thÂ©. final round of the fifth and, as It
proved, the last competition for the Coun
cil's cup for women of the San Francises â¢
Golf Club, was generally expected and
well deserved. Mrs. Brown had met and
disposed 6f one of her most dangerous
antagonists in the second round. This
was Miss Alice C. Hoffman, who won the
cup in the first two competitions held for
It, in January and February, 1900. Mrs.
Brown placed two victories to her credit
in January and March, 1901. It was hoped
by some golfers that Miss Alice Hager,
who is playing a strong game, might win
and so save the trophy for a while. But
Miss Hager, though she drove a longer
ball than Mrs. Brown several times, was
not so accurate in her approach shots or
ou the green. The medal play scores of
both contestants for the fifteen holes
played showed little difference. Mrs.
Brown's being 54, 32, total Â»t>, and Mlfl3
Hager's being 5<5, 32, total S3. But Mrs.
Brown's score in the first Â¦ round was
swelled by two eights as against two
sixes of her opponent, and in the second
round by an S against a 4. In the second
round Miss Hager lost the tenth and
eleventh, won the .twelfth, lost the thir
teenth and halved the fourteenth and fif
teenth. .. .*: .-:
Mrs. Brown has already won the
Council's cup for women of the San Ra
fael Golf Club and has one victory to her i
credit on the Poniatowski cup of the Bur..'
.llngame Country Club. Though the un
fair behavior of the spectators at Del
Monte deprived her of the first women's
Pacific Coast golf championship last year,
she is almost universally regarded aa the
strongest golfer of her sex in the noTth
ern part of California. It was hoped that
some of the most expert women golfers
of Southern California would contend at
Del Monte last year, but none of them
put In an appearance. If Mrs. Brown at
tends the meeting of the Pacific Coast
Golf Association' in Southern California
this year. It will be Interesting to observe
the results of the play between her ani
Mrs. Jean W. Bowers of Garvanza, who
Is the woman champion of the sotAh, and
will be upon links familiar to her. Mrs.
Bowers is commonly regarded In the
south as Invincible and has twice won
the women's championship of that Dart
of the State.
So far nothing definite is heard about
the team matches between the San Fran
cisco and Oakland Golf clubs, though thÂ©
first meeting of the teams in previous
seasons has taken place early In Decem
ber. It is likely. that both clubs are wait
ing for their' courses to be softened by
rain, which Is necessary after the long
dry spell and the parching north wind.
The golfers at the Presidio have been
playing the course in the reverse direc
tion lately, so .as to give the greens' and
the turf in front of them an opportunity
to grow strong. Early this week, the
golfers resumed play over the course In
the usual manner. 'President J. W. Byrne
of the San Francisco Golf Club is In XeW^
Tork and ftis.ndt likely that the meet
ing between the clubs will take place un
til his return: :
Three well known San Francisco golfers
recently played the Scotch game on a- sur
face as totally- unlike a Caledonian links
as can well be imagined. Indeed, the
game must- have been unique in the pe
culiarity-of the course on which it was
played. â¢ The holes were laid out on the
salt field at Salton, in Southern Califor
nia, the "greens" being mere circles
drawn with a piece of string and a nail
on the crust of salt : crystals The holes
were long and It is curious that, notwith
standing the glittering whiteness of th9
saline deposit, the golf ball was not diffi
cult to find. The CoahuIIa Indians, who
work â¢ on the salt field, were Impressed
Into. the service of the golfers and must
have been almost the strangest caddies
ever Employed. What they thought of
the game cannot even be guessed, for the
Coahuila Indian shows Absolutely no sign
of emotion, and seems-qulte indifferent to
external matters. ,:
A team of ladieg of the San Francisco
Golf Club will play against a team of
ladies of the Oakland Golf Club this
morning. at the Adams Point links. The
San Francisco representatives will prob
ably be the following: Mrs. R. Gilmac
Brown, Miss Alice Hager, Miss Alice C.
Hoffman. Mrs. L_ T. Scott.. Miss Florence
Ives,. Miss Bertha Dolbeer, Miss Edltlt
McBean and Jllss Sarah Drum. The
game will be over eighteen holes, match,

Whitehead. vi â¢
Owing to the limit placed by law on the
number of birds a man may shoot in one
day, there have been few birds killed as
compared -with previous years. It is ex
pected this will be felt during the next
few years, as it must mean a greater
number will return each season.
In Rlchardsons 1 Bay the canvasbacks

are not getting many of them*.. The clubs'

Ing, but the man who has no preserve to

The bay still continues the abiding place
of countless thousands of ducks of all va
rieties. The lack of rain has dried out the
interior ponds and other bodies of water,
thus forcing the birds back to the bay.
The San Joaquin Valley, which usually
attracts a large number of birds, has not
done so this year, the frost and" cold
winds absorbing the surface water which

cracks. .
The crack tennis players representing
both Stanford University and the Uni
versity of California; as well- as those of
the different preparatory schools of the
bay counties, are already practicing for
the Intercollegiate and academic cham
pionships. The former will be played as
usual In April, while the contests be
tween the "prep" schools will be held In
May. Â¦;Â¦.. Â¦ : . . Â¦ :.-Â¦;
The iqtercollegiate tennis this year will
hardly bÂ« as good as last, as Stanford Is
exceptionally weak- Harry Wiehe is the;
only man from the latter place who
classes with the cracks from Berkeley,
and it is doubtful if he will take part.
Although Paul Selby, Berkeley's star of
l&6t vear. Is out of college, the blue and'
gold will Bend fully as strong: a team imo
both singles and doubles as last year.
Next to Wiehe Du Val Moore is probably
the best player at Stanford, and althougn
he Is promising- it would be almost impos
sible lor him to improve enough to make
a winning team "with Wiehe. The latter
could undoubtedly hold his own with the
best player from Berkeley.
Stanford Is handicapped by a lack of
courts, the ones now down being unfit
to play on. This will be remedied in the
course of two or three years, when the
new gymnasium is built, but in the mean- ;
time bcth a lack of courts on which to
develop men and a, lack of material
makes Stanford's prospects look poor for
several years to come. Should Wiehe
and Moore decide not to play their col
lege will â¢ be . represented by the Lieb
brothers and C. Baker. These men
would Mand no chance of winning.
At "Berkeley there are more crack play
ers this year than ever before, and their
try-outs should result in some excellent
tennis. There are at least six first class
men and all are so evenly matched that
only a tournament could settle the ques
tion of supremacy among them. These
men are Drumraond MacGavin, Harold
Braly, Reuben Hunt. Fred Brown, Trow,
Hcndrick and Baker. MacGavin, with
Grant Smith, won the doubles tournament
for the championship of the coast. Braly
is doubles champion of Southern . Calif or
nia. Hunt is champion of several of the
Gulf States and Hendrlck is the Inter
scbolastlc champion of Southern Califor
nia. These men, with the exception of
Hunt and Braly, all have either two or
three years more at college, hence "the
prospects of blue and gold victories for
the next few years are good.
The academic tennis this year promises
to be much more interesting and much
closer than last year. For the last two
cr. three years Lowell High School has
been so strong that its representatives
have won without difficulty. They have
good men to represent them this year,
but some of the other schools have* also
developed good men and the contests will
be close. The Geary brothers from Seat
tle will represent Polytechnic High
School this year, in, .both singles and
doubles, and their chances of winning the
championship are considered good.
Lowell will hold a try-out a week from
to-4ay on the California Club, courts. Al
Rosenberg is the best player in the school
and will not have to go through the- tour
nament. He will play a round robin with
the tw.o players, .who .reach the finals of
the tournament. Rosenberg will repre
sent. Ms school in both singles and
doubles, consequently there will be but
cne place to try for. His partner in
double* will probably be Carl' Gardner
who hfelped win the championship for
LowÂ«ll last year. George and A. Jones
two brothers from Lakeport, are said to
be good men. It would not create sur
prise if George made the team ahead of
Gardner. .

LONDON, Jan., 17.â A blue book Issued

detailed information . from Â¦ Lord Milner,
the British High Commissioner, and Lord
Kitchener as to the causes of the exces
sive death-rate In the camps and refuta
tions of the. charges of cruelty.
The Rightists and Centrists warmly
protested against this view. ' General
Andre explained that promotion, like all
acts of executive' power, was necessarily
dependent on Parliament and that the
present system would not impair the
guarantees of the officers. The Chamber
by 308 .to 214 votes adopted a resolution
approving of General Andre's declara
tions.
. General Andre replied that he took the
system of promotion out of the hands of
the former army commission and assumed
the task himself because the commission
was an Irresponsible body, whereas the
Minister of War was a responsible per
sonage and the advancement of officers
was therefore in the hands of Parliament.
M. Lasles, anti-Semite, said the sug
gested measure was shameful. Cuneo
D'Ornano described the proposed . bill as
odious and declared* that General Andre
wished to cut France la twain.
At that stage of the proceedings General
Andre elicited an outcry from, the Right
ists and Centrists .and cheers from the
Leftists by announcing tha,t he was pre
paring a bill providing for the exclusion
of pupils of the schools of the congrega
tions from scholarships at the military
school. " ' "
The speaker said these Ministers had
by decrees Infringed the rights of the
officers; that General Andre, by assuming
the sole. right of promotion,' had decried
the democratic idea of advancement, and
that the officers' had no confidence in the
impartiality of the Minister, who was sub
ject to political influence. Officers, the
Deputy added, had been punished because
of their political opinions.

Neely was confronted with Reeves, who
reiterated his statement that Neely gave
him $4600 before laving to make the
books tally. Neely answered that th'n
was not so and said that he was with
an employe of the Postofflce at the hour
named by Reeves In his statement. .
Neely said he was charged with the
whole amount of the value of the stamps
delivered and that these he must account
for, either in stamps or money, when
called upon to do so. For this reason, ha
said, it made no difference whether these
Moya sales were recorded. Instead of
the stamps, he said, he had put tha
money in the vault.
Neely denied havinsr any interest In thÂ«
Cowan Printing Company ot Muncie.
Ind., and said that he had not received
$3000 commission from the lock box com
pany that put in the lock boxes in the
navana Postoffice.
In answer to the Flscal's question as to
why he had made no such record Neely
explained that in so far as the new is3uÂ»
of stamps was concerned records were
kept in his office, of the denominations
sold, in order that he might be in a
position to know what denominations to
order from Washington to replace the
stock. ' As for the matter of balancing
the account, the. stamps he ' turned over
to Moya had no bearing thereon. ..

he gave the surcharged stamps to Senor

It is also understood that a refusal on
the part of the Harriman people to accede
to the demands of the Goulds would mean
an alliance between tne Goulds and Sen
ator Clark, who would be able to give
the Goulds a Pacific Coast outlet by the
way of the projected Los Angeles-Salt
Lake line.
The purpose of the acquisition of the
Denver and Rio Grande and the Rio
Grande Western by the Goulds has be
come plain through the fight now in pro
gress. The situation is this: Through
their possession of the Rio Grande roads
the Goulds are laying claim to a large
percentage of the through traffic from
the coast. Should the Harriman people
refuse to turn over to the Gould connec
tions the amount of traffic the Goulds
think they are entitled to the result will
be problematical. Should the Goulds de
cide to get the amount of traffic they are
claiming their position entitles them to
rktes would undoubtedly be cut, as they
were in December, and the bulk of the
traffic would. go from" Ogden by the way
of Grand Junction and Pueblo, where it
would be delivered to the Missouri Pa
cific for StJ Louis and the East.
CHICAGO,* Jan. 17.â The Record-Herald
to-morrow will say: The Gould and Har
riman interests are engaged In a struggle
for transcontinental traffic which Â¦ will
test to its utmost the strength of the
community of interests. The two inter
ests have been unable to get together, al
though several attempts have been made
recently. The executive officials of the
Colorado and Utah lines were unable to
settle their differences in meetings held
here and adjourned from day to day dur
ing the present week.
As a Â¦ result of the unsettled condition
of traffic matters in Colorado and Utah
the officials of lines east of the river were
equally unable to make firm pledges that
rates would be maintained for another
month. The fight which the Goulds have
begun for recognition as a transcontinen
tal factor through the Ogden gateway is
the, explanation of the withdrawal of the
Missouri Pacific from the Colorado and
Utah Association and the refusal of its
officials up to date to re-enter, j

Winnie O'Connor got a great move on in
the concluding race. He had the mount

his trying to make the first turn in ad

Everett Hale, president of the I Lend-a-
Hand Society, which for months has been
collecting and shipping clothing, food and
other things to the Boer . prisoners held
by the British in Bermuda, recently sent
his assistant, the Rev. W. S. Key, tcU-Vlslt
the prison camps and report on the v tbn- v
ditions. Key, who has just returned, says
he was permitted to visit all the camps
on six islands and to talk at will with the,
prisoners. There are now about 5000, men
and boys In the prison laagers. All the
prisoners complained of having no cloth
ing .except what they wore when cap
tured. Some of them had not had a
change of underclothing for sixteen
months.
During Key's visit clothing was dis
tributed, but hats, caps, socks, towels,
handkerchiefs, underclothing, suspenders
and soap, needles, thread, buttons and
knives are badly needed. The short allow
ance of vegetables was complained of.
The Rev. Dr. Hale asks for contribu
tions of such food as oatmeal, cornmeal,
condensed milk, all kinds of cereals, tea,
coffee, peas, beans, rice, sago, evaporated
apples, canned corn, dessicated vegetables
and tobacco for the old men. Money is
also needed.

Jack Dean and Gus Saulsbury fought
four rounds to a draw. Both men fought
from start to finish. It was by far tho
best bout of the evening.
Tom Burke quit in the third round of
his bout with Charles Hawley. Burke
scored two knockdowns, but the body
blows he received took the fight out of
him.
Joe Reagan sent Mike Hart into dream
land in the second round -with a right
hook on the Jaw. The loser made things
hum until he lost his senses.
The Judges' decision in -the bout between
"Young Kid" McFadden and Ed Flnerty
met with disapproval. McFadden was
given the decision and the crowd hooted
until Referee Greggalns stated that the
decision was a just one. as McFadden was
the aggressor. Finerty came to life In
the last round and had his opponent
groggy. McFadden practically fought
himself to a standstill.
Dan Sullivan, an aggressive youth, who
reminded the spectators of Sharkey, bus
tled Mike Foy around tho ring for four
rounds and earned a decision. If Foy had
the least knowledge of boxing he would
have won easily, as Sullivan -was wild and
awkward in his movements. ,
"Kid" Parker ended the aspirations of
Billy Connelly In the second round. Par
ker proved his superiority and landed at
will. Connelly succumbed to a torrent of
jolts and swings.
John Crowe, the youth who put "Win
nie" O'Connor over the hurdles in boxinsj.
secured a decision over Dick Cullen after
four rounds of tame fighting. Cullen re
ceived a black eye for hts trouble.
Amateur boxers led strenuous' lives for

BREAKING OFF AN ENGAGE
MENTâT. C. W., City. The. giving of a
ring known as an engagement ring Is
customary, but not absolutely necessary.
If the lady for reasons which seem good
to her breaks oft the engagement sho
should do so by letter and at the same
time return to the gentleman with the
letter anything she may have received
from him in the way of photographs,
letters or gifts which she may have re
ceived during the engagement. When the
letter Is acknowledged by the gentleman
he should send to her any picture, letter
or presents he â¢ received from the lad"
A lady -would not- care to have any re
minder of the', man she was once en
gaged to if she felt that if, Bhe did not
break off the engagement her happiness
would be compromised, and therefore
would not hesitate, to give him those
presents back; yet there is this to say
that a present freely given is the proo^
erty of the one who received it and thts
recipient would be justified In retaining
the same. The gentleman migjit aak that
"she give those presents back," and if
she did not he might commence an ac
tion for the recovery of the same, because
there is no law to prevent a man from
conamencins an action, no matter in what
ridiculous light , he might* by such a
course place himself. If neither Da -tv
should consent to breaking off the en
gagement then the probabilities are that

A curious illustration of the morbid fondness of
some people for crime is reported from Paris. The
police authorities recently offered for sale a number
of jewels and trinkets which had been connected with
criminal cases, and it was found that they brought
prices far above their intrinsic value, owing to the
number' of bidders who were eager to have something
associated with a famous murder or other crime. â¢
"As the thing reached the base of tha
hill it paused a minute, and we saw a
large Jackrabbit completely encircled
about the body by two blacksnakes, which
must have measured five feet at least.
The rabbit was tearing at the snakes with
his teeth in a frantic effort to free him
self. The three rolled over and over upon
the ground until they were within a Few
feet of the water's edge. Suddenly the
jack must have got a lucky tooth jab Into
some part of the snakes' anatomy, for one
of the reptiles sprang through the air and
landed out into the water. The ' other
realizing that it had to battle all alone
with the ferocious jack, after holding on
a moment quickly unwound itself and went
up the hillside, with the rabbit in hot pur
suit. They v/ere soon lost to view. The
snake which had been thrown into the
river swam to the opposite bank and also
disappeared."
"I live near New Creek, a branch oÂ£ the.
Potomac River. One day I and several
friends were sitting on the banks of the
river, fishing, when we were startled by
the noise of breaking branches behind us
and up the wooded hillside. Suddenly
there came Into view a rapidly- revolving:
ball of gray and black, which was spring
ing high into the air.
G. Henry Hosack. of Keyser. W. Va., in
describing an encounter of this kind,
which' he says was witnessed by himself
and several friends a few years ago, said:
It is a well-known fact that the black
snake, when hungry, will prey upon birds
or any animal which it can overpower in
its deadly coils. A jackrabbit la. how
ever, considered a tough proposition, and
for a pair of snakes to develop an ambi
tion to conquer one ipC the full vigor of
health is rather an exhibition of valor.

JAPANESE RELIGION-Nimrod, Cit.,\
By the constitution of Japan absolute
freedom of religious belief and practice Is
secured so long, as it is not prejudicial to
peace and order. The religion of the Jap
anese is the Shinto or Kami no Mlchi (the
way of the gods), the indigenous faith with
its twelve sects, .and . Buddhism with Its
twenty-five creeds, Introduced from China,
A.D.553. ' â¢â¢Â¦^v>
Nothing more clearly marks : the development of
the spirit of humanity among civilized men than this
increased sensitiveness to. the sufferings of others
and the augmented sense of a responsibility "to public
sentiment arising Â¦ from that sensitivenesA. So om-
The incident is a striking illustration of â¢ the' : ; in
creased force' of public opinion and ofrttie^great' de
gree to which the most powerful nations "and 'states
men feel themselves responsible to the of
mankind. At the beginning of the last " century . few
people would have concerned themselves about the
sufferings entailed by such a war as that in the.Trans
vaal; and those who did concern themselves about
the matter would have had but little "response to
their appeals for a larger humanity in" the. conduct
of. war. Their criticisms would have :â¢ fallen : upon
deaf ears. No nation engaged in the Napoleonic con
tests of that time was sensitive* to what' other- people
said of its tactics in the struggle, and no statesman
would *have thought of paying attention to foreign
criticisms had they been uttered.. '
There can be no doubt that the utterance of the
King and the cheers of the Lords were due to the
controversy now raging between the British and
their Continental critics concerning >the conduct of
British troops in the South African campaign.'
Cheering in the House of Lords during a speech
from the throne is something like a breach of eti
quette. It is so great a violation oi ancient precedent
that the officials of the House were dismayed by its
occurrence, and, 'notwithstanding the' evident satis
faction of the King, they signaled deprecations of the
outburst. Evidently, then, the have felt '.very
acutely the attacks made upon the army arid are 1 in
no mood to treat criticism. with silent contempt. ;'
KING EDWARD, in his speech from tHe
throne at the opening of Parliament, com
mended his troops in South Africa not only
for their courage, but for "cheerfulness in the en
durance of hardships incident to guerrilla warfare,
and a humanity, even to their own detriment, in their
treatment of the enemy, which are' worthy of the
highest' praise." We are told that when the words
were uttered the peers, peeresses and high officers of
state broke out into a prolonged cheer, â¢ which was
repeated again and again.'';/?/.;' --
NITRO-GLYCERINâ J. E. S.. Aromas.
Monterey County, Cal. NItro-glycerin is
an oily, colorless liquid, with a specific
gravity of 1.60. It has no smell, has a
taste that at first is sweet, but soon be
comes pungent, like pepper. v It is made
by mixing 100 parts of fuming nitric acid
at 50 degrees Baume with 200 parts of sul
phuric acid; when cool thirty-eight parts
of glycerin are added, allowing it Â¦ to
trickle slowly down .the sides of the ves
sel. The glycerin remains on the surface
for hours without mixing. The glycerin
and add are stirred with a glass rod for
ten seconds and poured Into twenty times
its volume of water, when the nltro-gly
cerin will instantly be precipitated to the
extent of seventy-six parts, or double the
amount of glycerin employed. It is re
peatedly washed with water and then sat-,
urated with bicarbonate of soda or lime.
It has been found that pure nltro-glycerin
dropped on a thoroughly redhot Iron as
sumes a spheroidal shape and flashes off
into vapor in the same way as gunpow
der,- but if the iron Is not redhot â only
hot "enough to cause the nltro : glycerin

HUMANITY IN WAR.
INDIAN TRIBE â Nlmrod, City. The
published list of Indian tribes of North
America does not give the name of either
Miscaleno or MIscalero. The nearest to
either name is the Misalahs, who at one
time inhabited the territory, between Fort
Ross and San Francisco Bay, and the
Miskanas, who dwelt near the San Buena
Ventura Mission.
.It is said by the advocates of the' system that the
failure is due wholly to the. lack of a legal method of
making; contributions compulsory. They assert that
if the contributions had been kept up there would,
have been perpetually an ample sum to provide pen-,
sions for each in turn as the time came for retire
ment. Under the voluntary system, however, there is
no means for maintaining the contributions up to the
required amount. The failure, therefore, is said to be
not so much a failure of*!he pension system as of the
voluntary contribution system. â¢; At this distance we
are not able to pronounce judgment upon the plan
nor upon the manner in which it was managed, but in
the East, t!ie opinion seems to prevail that the scheme
of providing. pensions for? retiring teachers by con
tributions from those remaining in the service is im
practicable.under existing laws. y-.- .
to' the reports that come to us the great
est discontent with the system is due to the fact that
the withdrawal of so many members from the scheme
has brought it about that even if the pensions were to
be continued those who contributed most "would re
ceive least. The younger teachers -who entered the
scheme when first undertaken have paid their contri
butions into the fund right along, and thus provided
pensions for. the older teachers who resigned. Now,
however, that the' contributions 'have^ diminished,. the
younger 'teachers perceive that they cannot possibly
receive :the same amount of pension as the older
teachers have been getting, and, furthermore, that
there is an increasing danger the entire fund may ' be
exhausted, long before it comes their turn , to be pen
sioned/ and so they may lose their money altogether'.
FROM Chicago comes a report that the teach
ers' pension, scheme undertaken there with such
sanguine expectations a few, years ago has
proven to be a virtual failure.' It appears . that "a
large number of teachers who entered into it with
high hopes have grown weary of paying assessments
and have withdrawn. The consequence is the pen
sions have been scaled down by degrees until they
now amount to less than half what was at first prom
ised.; Of course each reduction in" the pension has in
creased the dissatisfaction, and the scheme is about
to collapse. '

There are some obligations which are not nullified
even by the defensive and precautionary fervor of
our people on the subject. Our Supreme Court has
established the principle that our right to exclude
derives from an international treaty with China. True,
we can break that treaty and China cannot resist its
violation, but it is not seriously argued that such an
act conforms to the honor or dignity of this republic.
As long, then, as we recognize the treaty we must
keep faith according to its terms and not exceed them
in any proposed legislation.
If any of the entirely' new acts is passed it must
undergo the same processes of judicial and execu
tive interpretation. Its enforcement will be impaired
by doubts as to the meaning of its provisions. It
must be construed by the terms of our treaty with
China, as the present law has been, and also by its
conformity to our own constitution and to inter
national law. This is a deliberate and costly process,
and when it is finished there may well be doubt that
we have secured any better exclusion measure than
the existing one, which has already gone through the
refining fires of interpretation.
IN discussing the new bill to exclude Chinese Mr.
Loud of California makes a suggestion that may
well be considered. He favors, personally, the
re-enactment of the existing law for an indefinite
period, giving as his reason that all of its provisions
have been subjected to executive and judicial inter
pretation and are now being beneficially applied to
the purpose for which the law was enacted. No fur
ther interpretations remain to be made. The officers
who are enforcing the law know just what it means,
;.nd its administration is not hampered by uncer
tainty as to its provisions. That it is so administered
as to effect its purpose is not questioned. The re
duction of our Chinese population under its opera
tion is the most efficient testimony to its usefulness.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
A CHANCE TO SMILE.
It is to be borne in mind of course that these
statements of* the inadequacy of the roads to handle
the traffic of the country were made as parts of a
showing in favor of big combinations and of the ab
sorption of small roads by larger ones. When ample
allowance is made for that fact, however, there re
mains enough of force in the description given of the
laxk of facilities to excite interest in the problem set
forth. Evidently Mj\ Hill believes we are to have a
new era of railroad construction as . well as of rail
way consolidation. He gives no intimation of who
will undertake the new enterprises, but' it would seem
he is quite sure they will be forthcoming. As he
says, "the West must have them or suffer." Such
being the case, railroad developments will be watched
more closely than ever. There is no telling what the
great syndicates may have up their sleeves. : '
Mr. Hill is quoted as saying: "A careful examina
tion of the railway problem from a national stand
point will, I believe, show beyond question that the
business of the country has outgrown the facilities
on most of the trunk lines, and that new facilities not
now apparent will be necessary to relieve the situa
tion. * * * Conditions in this country change
very rapidly. * * * To-day we find the volume
of traffic so great east of Chicago that the railways
are not able to move it under the present conditions.
How will these conditions be changed, and at whose
cost? Who will build new lines or increase old ones?
These are the questions which I will not undertake
to answer, further than to say that the West must
have the facilities or suffer for the want of them.
The public must bear in mind that a bankrupt road
cannot furnish good service."
MR. JAMES J. HILL, m a recent interview' in
which he once more repeated his often ex
pressed conviction that railway combinations
are not only beneficial to the public, but are actually
necessary to the welfare of industry and trade, went
on to speak of the congested state of transportation
throughout the country as presenting a problem
whose solution will require extensive railway, con
struction. It would appear, then,. that the evil of
which so much complaint has been heard all through
the fall is of much greater magnitude than has been
supposed. 'Â¦'.

ThiS is the most serious question that has arisen
since the constitutional perpetuity of the Government
was questioned by the South before the Civil War.
It so seriously affects American interests and domes
tic, production, and the whole policy of protection,
as to require re-argument in the courts, and if the
power claimed be found in the constitution the neces
sity of amending that instrument will become an
issue in our politics.
Therefore, it will be seen that, as -government is
non-existent without the taxing power, and wherever
that power is deposited is the actual government, if
the Senate and the President hold that power exclu
sive of the House, they are the government, and we
have a system consisting of an Executive and a legis
lative-body of one house only. â¢â¢
By parity of reasoning a tariff treaty becomes a
revenue bill, and the constitution says that such bill
shall originate in the House. Yet this'modern inter
pretation cuts the House out of any and air jurisdic
tion over the revenue, removes the subject from pub
lic discussion in the cpen Congress and takes it be
hind closed doors in executive sessions of the;Sen
ate to; be settled by that body, arid' the President.-
Again,' if the Senate and Executive by treaty may
lower or remove duties, they max, by the same means
raise them. If such jurisdiction- exist at all, it applies
both ways, and its use is without limitation. '. 'f '..
It seems plain that this declares the enactment of
revenue bills to be a legislative act, and. among the
powers deposited in the whole Congress. Vi The Sen
ate is given only concurrent powers over such legist
lation, and nothing seems clearer than that . it was^
never intended that*- tbCSenate shouLdf upetits?:treatyt,
making pewer to nullify an act of the whole* Congress'
relating to revenue. /
Our Federal constitution says that all legislative
powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress
of the United States, which shall consist in a Senate
and House of Representatives, and that all bills for
raising revenue shall originate in the House of Rep
resentatives, but the Senate may propose or concur
with amendments, as en other bills. ...,'.. T -.-..,
If the President and Senate by treaty can reduce
a tariff 10 per cent they can reduce it 106 per cent,
removing it altogether. This is perfectly plain. If
that authority exist in the treaty-making power it
exists without limitation. If the constitution permit
it, then the constitution establishes a Government
consisting of the President and the Senate. The
highest function of government is in its . power of
taxation. Without that there is no government.
To illustrate: Congress may pass a tariff law
establishing rates of duty and designed to N yield
revenue lequired for the support of the Government.
The House may remain unchanged in its' majority,
favoring the continuance of such a tariff, b"ut the
Senate may change and with the Executive favor free
trade. It is seen at once that the President and Sen
ate may in such case make and ratify commercial
treaties that repeal every paragraph of the tariff, re
move all protective features and practically establish
free trade, compelling the Government to resort to
direct taxation and to increase the internal revenue
taxes in order to secure the revenue required for its
support.
The latter branch, however, has steadily en
croached upon this equality of the House. The first
step taken was the placing in the hands of the Sen
ate and the Executive of the' power to conclude
treaties of reciprocity, which voided the rates of duty
established in. a tariff act.
No one seems to have given expression to the
effect of such a transfer of power.
This raises an issue that is destined to figure very
largely 'in Congress and the courts. The constitu
tion requires that revenue bills originate' in' the
House, and " from 1789 until .within 'the last few
years that provision has been construed to' give the
House power over such legislation, at least equal to
that. of the Senate. '
AT the close of the first day's hearing given to
the Cuban junta by the House Committee of
Ways and Means a, member of the, committee
said that a Senator had declared that Â£the .^Senate
would settle the tariff as to Cuba, ana r th% r; House
would have nothing to do with it. To this Mr. Dal
zell of Pennsylvania replied: "He will_find out dif
ferently before he gets through." I L -.' Â¦
SAYS LEFTY BANNON, "MAHONY"

Humanity, in fact, is no longer an unimportant
feeling among civilized men. . Slowly but" surely it is
working to put an end to war:by developing an ab
horrence of the evils that attend wars. Public.senti
ment on such subjects is 'no longer despised. Nations
feel their responsibility to it iand kings from their
thrones appeal to it.
War can never be made lenient. Its object is to"
destroy, to kill and to crush. Its methods must
necessarily be harsh. It is evident, however, that
civilization has come to look upon it with something
of abhorrence and to insist that it be waged with
some respect for life and property. Weyler's methods
in Cuba stirred Americans into a war for the libera
tion of Cuba, and yet they were nothing like so se
vere as the methods pursued by the conquerors of
times past;. and it is safe to say that there is not a
single nation in Europe whose troops have not com
mitted excesses far grosser than the worst that have
been committed in South Africa. That sad truth was
revealed in the conduct of the allies in putting down
the Boxer uprising in China, and yet even in that
far-off war there was a strong public sentiment that
held to account the generals and the Governments
that permitted the outrages.
found an impression had been made upon the. British
people by the 'criticisms ; of . Continental. Europe upon
Kitchener's tactics that Xhamberlain was stung to a
sharp reply. His words had no other effect than that
of increasing the intensify of the criticisms, especially
in Germany; and now the King himself has found it
necessary in the most emphatic manner to meet the
charge by commending his troops for humanity. '

ARRIVED.
The gradual evolution of science and
art shows what influence religion has on
man. ' It has stimulated the great art of
painting. The noblest artists of the world
depicted Christian and biblical subjects.
It was the church that had stimulated
the great works of the masters. / Religion
had stimulated the builders of the mas
sive and wonderful buildings of Europe-
Cologne Cathedral, St. Peter's, St. Paul's,
Westminster and a thousand other mag
nificent and noble structures. The ab
sence of religion and atheism only
brought disaster, as was evidenced in
the fall of Rome and . the decline of
France in the days of the reign of ter
ror. Keligion, said the rabbi, stimulates
every element of civilization. *
Rabbi Nieto, at the Congregation
Sherlth Israel, spoke last night on the
adaptability of the Jew to any surround
ing owing to the hardships he had under
gone, and yet in those countries where
he was persecuted he was among the
first to come forward in time - of need
He adapted himself readily to commerce
for the reason that he had no home, t no
country, and the persecution to which he
had been subjected developed hi3 mind
and his energy. Â¦
In those days, said he, they thought
more about beautifying tne temple than
their own dwellings and all went toward
the civilizing influence. Kxquisite archi
tecture was Known in the days when men
worshiped at the shrine of tneir gods. It
was then religion that conduced to those
noble structures â their temples â and so it
came that progress and civilization be
came a fact. Keligion is the foundation
ot ail government.
It i3 worth time, Â¦ saldi the lecturer, to
ascertain to 'what extent religion haa
stimulated intelligence in man. He viv
idly pictured, the religious architecture of
the Egyptians and tne builders of their
own taoernacle when gold and silver and
copper were brought for the purpose that
it might show the greatest beauty.
â¢ Rabbi Voorsanger chose for his sermon
last night at the Congregation Emanu-El
the relationship between religion and civ
ilization, showing that religion was the
foundation of. all civilization from time
immemorial. He asked first what had re
ligion done for civilization and second
what had civilization done for religion.
In support of his demonstrations in the
ifavor of religion as the one and great
'factor in the progress of the world he
cited the growth of temples and taber
nacles in tne earliest days and how the
greatest artists gave up ihelr money and
time to labor for the erection of a nouse
betltting the holding of religious exer
cises to the Deitv.
Admiral Bradford was favorable to hav
ing the cable laid, operated and controlled
by the Government, not for commercial
considerations, but as a naval and mili
tary Necessity. He said the British navy
had great advantages over other navies
because of being linked by cable with all
insular possessions. If there was a war
with Great Britain to-morrow. Admiral
Bradford said. It would be impossible fo?
us to communicate by cable with the Phil
ippines.
Admiral Bradford said the Navy Depart
ment bad made all soundings and had
found a. practicable route which was all
ready for the Government to begin oper
ations on. It started from Monterey. Cal.,
which he considered a better point than
San Francisco. He did not recommend a
cable of American make, as the Industry
Â¦was not developed here, and It was essn
tial to get the best the world produced.
Clark said tbe plan presented by the
Commercial Cable Company contemplated,
exclusive arrangements with the lines fa
the Far East, the effect of which would
restrict the business to this one line, pre
venting competition and such advantages
to the Government and public a3 woulci
accrue trom competition. He emphasized
the prospective commercial development
of the Orient and American trade in that
quarter and told of the alleged disad
vantage that would accrue from, any prt
vate control which would, he said, tie up
the business for an indefinite period and
place the Far Eastern links of the cable
system entirely under foreign control.
General Greely stated tbat he would
favor Government control of the Pacitic
project and showed the extent to -which
Governments were extending their con
trol of cables. One of the recent exten
sions was by Germany on the China coast,
while France and other countries were
making similar cable extensions. General
Greely said an American cable to tha
Philippines would do much good in Ameri
canizing the islands. He cited Instances
of the current news from the Philippines
coming by foreign cables, presenting tho
affairs of Germany and other countries,
but not mentioning the most Important
developments in the United States.
General ' Greely stated tnat during the
Spanish-American war it became neces
sary for him to secure control of the Hay
tien cable for thirty days at J200O a day.
In time of war. he said, it was impossible
to observe due secrecy when cable lines
were under foreign control. He had dis
cussed the subject with President McKln
le% who was favorable to "an American
cable .under American control, in peaca
and War."
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 17.â The ad
vantages of Government control of the
projected Pacific cable were presented to
day before the Commerce Committee of
the House. Admiral Bradford, who has
had charge of the cable soundings; Gen
eral Greely, head of the Signal Service,
who has devoted much attention to the
subject; Captain Russell, who has done
much of ths cable work In the Philip
pines, and Thomas F. Clark, vice presi
dent of the Western Union Telegraph
Company, were among those present.

MEMORANDUM.
Br ship Strathdon, Walker, Queenstown.
Schr Barbara Hernater, Benedikten, Eureka.
Schr Fortuna* Olsson, Eureka. ;
THE sinking of the "Walla "Walla
has resulted in temporarily put
ting a stop to the earning capaci
ty of two vessels now in north
ern ports. In one case the delay
may Involve considerable loss. The new
four-masted barkentine Aurora is lying off
the St. Paul mill, Seattle, with 1,500,000
feet of lumber aboard, but unable to put
to sea until certain machinery which went
down with the Walla Walla can be dupli
cated in this city and shipped north. The
British bark Pinmore is the other sufferer
and in her case the delay may cost her
a valuable charteri The Pinmore was
recently picked up by the tug Tyee, after
having been abandoned off the coast by
master and crew. Both the Pinmore's
anchors were lost. New mud hooks and
I chains were ordered in this city and
shipped on the Walla Walla. It is now
i said that there are no 'Other anchors on
the coast of the size required by the Pin
more. New ones will have to be ordered
in the East and the delay will in all
probability cost the Pinmore her charter.
Considerable comment has -een oc
casioned in shipping circles by the "heavy
loading- of many of the steam colliers
plying between here and northern coal
ports. Some of these vessels are enor
mous carriers and no matter what the
weather may be make the trip laden to
â¢their utmost capacity. Their decks are
aswim from one end of the voyage to the
other and but little surprise is occasioned
when one of them falls victim to her in
ability to battle with the elements. The
Pleiades arrived here last Tuesday from
Ladysmith with over 5000 tons of coal. Her
deck was almost on a level with the sur
face of the sea and even on the bay the
waves, small as they were, broke over
her sides. As she passed up the bay
many an old sailorman shook his head
and spoke of the colliers whose names
swelled the list of the missing. The abil
ity of these heavily laden vessels to
weather some of the winter storms en
countered along: the coast is quoted in
the marine world as onÂ© of the mysteries
of the deep.

on a floating craft. She has been moved
ninety feet nearer the sea than *where the
storm left her, but no attempt will be
made to float her until the spriner.

One of the main. reasons for putting the
four. ' classes :in .the. Orphan: Asylum build-
Ing is that the pupils will' have a large
yard for recreation: - At. the present time
one of the rooms rented for the purpose
is unsanitary; and- some sickness prevails
among the pupils on that account. ' Â¦
;The Board" of Education. decided yester
day.to rent four rooms' in the Protestant
Orphan Asylum building on Haight street
and use them as an adjunct to. the Halght
Primary, School. : . At* present the outside
rooms are Â¦ widely scattered, and It is
deemed â¢ advisable to center them In one

GEORGE STONE, NEWLY AP
POINTED;, ADJUTANT GEN
ERAL OF. CALIFORNIA.
Kerch Kuykendall, Hartley B. Lake and
John B. Fredenstein, the suspects under
arrest in connection with the attempted
theft of ore yesterday morning, which re
sulted in a fight in the bowels of -Battle
Mountain, -were put through a severe
"sweating" to-day, but nothing of Impor
tance has been developed.
< A. score of detectives have been engaged
by the independence Company and pri
vate detectives from other big mines are
lending their assistance. The mine own
ers say they propose to clean out the ore
thieves if it takes every detective in the
West to do it. / -
This order nearly precipitated /a disas
trous strike and was only modified at the
earnest request of the parties most inter
ested. Manager Shipman estimates that
the stealings before this new order was
issued amounted to between 120,000 and
$30,000 a month ever since the Bonanza
was sold by Stratton to the English cor
poration.
VICTOR, Colo., Jan. 17.â Manager Ship
man of the Independence mine, owned by
the Stratton Independence Company of
London, England, stated to-day , that
about J40.000 worth of ore had been stolen
by ore pirates from the mine during the
past eight months, v about . $5000 every
month since the trouble' between the min
ers and management on account of the
"strip to the skin" order issued early last
summer.
Prior to this call they had Seen a num
ber of the Ministers and other, represen
tatives attached to the foreign legations
and embassies in Washington, and as a
result had become convinced " that ela
borate foreign exhibits could not i be
counted on for an exposition In this coun
.try during the year. 1903. They find for
instance that a great Japanese fair is to
be given under Government; auspices In
1903 and if the exposition is. postponed
until 1P04 everything of interest- exhibited
there can be brought to St. -Louis the
following year. It is the desire of the
exposition that the foreign-, Exhibits es
pecially shall be .very complete.
"In 1903 we can make the exposition as
great as any ever given," said ' Governor
brands, "but if we postpone â¢ it a year
it will surpass anything In the: exposition
line ever attempted. We can. be ready in
1903, but it is questionable whether, we
can secure what we want : from abroad
by that time." . .-VV
In order to interest foreign govern
ments it is the desire of the exposition
management that the foreign agents of
the exposition be appointed, and accred
ited by the State Department and steps
are being taken to that end -now. Yes
terday Governor Francis and Mr. , Busch
extended an invitation through, the Ger
man Embassy to Prince Henry to visit
St. Louis during his stay in .this country
but no reply had been received up to
noon to-day. â¢-â¢âÂ¦
â¢ The gentlemen named made an admls
s'loir'ot th's fact to-day in the course: of
a conversation at- the- .White ' House,
where they had' called "to ; interest the
President m efforts they are making to
urge oh foreign governments the desir
ability of full and complete'representa
tion at the St. Louis Exposition.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.â Since arriving
in Washington ex-Governor Francis,
president of the Louisiana Purchase Ex
position, and Adolphus Busch, chairman
cf the committee on foreign relations of
the exposition, have - become [ : convinced
that if the exposition is to secure a really
notable collection of foreign exhibits that
will eclipse exhibits heretofore sent from
European; nations to other', , expositions,
there j must* be . a postponement of the
opening 'of the 'great 'fair to be held at
St Louis from 1903 'to 1904.';^
Wu Ting Fang has recently made rep
resentations to the United States for the
return of the value of â¢ the silver taken
from the salt yamen, and he is highly
gratified â¢ that the Government has de
cided to comply with his request.
France refused to receive from Its ex
pedition in China valuable curios sent by
General Voyron, commanding the French
troops, and Germany was disposed to re
turn the astronomical instruments seized
by her forces in Peking and forwarded
to Berlin. China was unwilling, how
ever, to bear the cost of their return.
The silver was found by the marines
immediately after the capture of the
city. It was appraised by a board of offi
cers and sold and the proceeds were
transmitted to this country and deposited
In the treasury by Secretary Long. It
was thought that an act of Congress
would benectssary in order to draw the
money out of the treasury in case of its
repayment to China. The authorities
have decided, however, that . Congres
sional action is unnecessary.
CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
"W., "WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.â President
Roosevelt to-day took the first step in
re-storing to China, the property belong
ing to her which was seized by the United
States. He directed Secretary Long to
deliver to the State Department for trans
mission to Wu Ting Fang, the Chinese
Minister, the sum of $376,000. This amount
represents the value of silver bullion
seized in the salt yamen at Tientsin by
United States marines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The evidence in the case was wholly a
repetition of the facts previously cabled.
The defense submitted that no statutory
offense had been committed, as there was
no evidence that Broecksman had ever
received the letters alleged to have been
written by Dr. Krause. The Lord Chief
Justice intimated that he would â¢deliver
judgment to-morrow.
In the course of the examination of the
press censor of Johannesburg- It trans
pired that the postofflce officials there
were in the habit of sending: to the censor
all letters addressed to United States Con
sul Gordon. T,he Lord Chief Justice asked
ir" such letters'^ were subject to censorship.
On being informed that he was not bound
to reply, the censor declined to answer
the question.
The prisoner pleaded nof guilty and the
Solicitor General, Sir. Henry Carson, pro
ceeded to detail the facts alreadv testi
fied to In the Police Court. I Broecksman,
whom Dr. Krause Is alleged to have in
cited to the murder of Foster, was exe
cuted by the British in South Africa,
If the prisoner and his friends had been
suspected of a d<?slgn to explode dyna
mite in the court the precautions against
the admission of unauthorized persons
could not have been more stringent.
Every one was closely and
compelled to produce a card of admission.

George Stone served through the Union
war. with distinction. He Was commis
sioned captain and afterward promoted to
the rank of lieutenant colonel of a col
ored . cavalry regiment. He resigned this
commission after a few months and then
took a captaincy in an infantry reginlent
and at the close, of the war resigned with
the rank of colonel.
..Colonel Stone became a railroad con
struction contractor and met; with great
success. He also paid some attention to

mining properties. He is an active mein
i ber of the Union League Club and is
strongly identified with Republican poll
tics. He has been a delegate to the Re

man of the Republican . State Central
Committee.
. Colonel Stone to-day filed his oath of
office as adjutant general. He . sent the

office. : Â¦ -y ,'-l", . â¢ . '. . : ' . *V Â¦'.-
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 17.â Although
the constitution and':, the} laws
recognize Sacramento asÂ» the seat
of State government; It < Is" never
theless a fact that ' under , the
Gage administration the capital city is
always the last place to hear of the ac
tion of the Governor upon any important
public matter. It leaked out only to-day
that the appointment of Colonel George
Stone of San Francisco as adjutant gen
eral hasbeen recorded on the books of
the Governor's office. Since, owing to the
system of exclusiveness which, prevails
in that office, these books are" practically
not accessible to the public or to newspa

lALKENBUBQ'S \. VISIT TO
san FRANcisGO Woodmen
The programme of "yesterday opened
with the 'Mozart- Symphony No; 5 (Jupi
ter). ' That was not -on: the whole so
satisfying as the Beethoven- of last week.
When an orchestra can play Mozart it
can play anything, and. there are " still
some things a little beyond our orchestra
despite the Mayor's generous . dictum.
The absolute* finish, subtlety of shading,
exquisitely exact precision demanded by
-Mozart, with his snare of seeming, sim
plicity, were not there, though tliere was
admirable- work done in the first and last
movements of the symphony, work evl
dencinar the steady stride of the orchestra
toward triumph. ' â¢ '
The slow .movement lacked character
that clean 'drawing, that defines- with ex
aggeration the ; features: of a composition
âand was .not altogether sympatheti
cally conceived. The ? Mozart color was
caught In the scherzo,' though its delicate
shapeliness suffered from^a little heavi
ness of handling. J !Â¦ ' X ',Â¦ *
v The novelty of 'the afternoon was the
new overture by E. N. Reznlcek, "Donna
Â¦ Diana." It .is ;-a spirited-^-, and colorful
affair, a little - cheap x in its principal
theme, but skillfully orchestrated and a
picturesque addition to. orchestral litera
ture. - The .overtures was excellently
played by J the 'Orchestra/ Wagner's
"Traume" that game jxext, arranged for
'orchestra by Was "perhaps the
most happily conceived number on the
programme.. Â¦ given,
with sentiment -'withotit*- sentimentality,
perfect poise and. mush tonal, beauty.
The Massenet "Scenes Pittoresuues"
closed- the programoi^TAuft i were inter
preted with, clean, flrnv. v igrip Â¦ on their
characteristic modernity. ' Hearty ap
plause greeted r all: th6' numbers. . /;
Â§ The most successful of the Stelndorff
symphony concerts was , the T third .and
last of the first series of three,' given yes
terday afternoon at'the'. Grand Opera
house, j The improvement in the work of
the 'orchestra is ; simply astonishing and
the. appreciation of the . audience' keeps
.pace with it. The house was large yes
terday and "the success of the series has
encouraged the directors of â¢ the sym
phony society to announce another series
of three j concerts for January 31,'Febru
ary 14 and February 28. ' Buf the sup
port must, be still more' substantial to
place the concerts On a thoroughly safe
basis, though "there 'appears to be
no doubt that that support" will now be
generously forthcoming. Mayor Schmltz,
in an enthusiastic little - speech, in which
he I referred to the Steindorff orchestra
as "not only on. a footing with, the best
in America, but also in' the world." in
troduced the matter of the' new series to
the audience, as an Institution meriting
their heartiest encouragement..--. .-
The Mayor's remarks^? as those of an
expert on his subject, were received with
much enthusiasm. ' - â¢ . . .

The schooner Henry Wilson, which ar
rived from Grays -Harbor last night, re
ports that on January 15 a lifeboat from
the "Walla Walla , was picked up. The
point where the boat was found was about
eighty-seven miles . northwest of Cape
Mendocino, in latitude 41 degrees 27 min*
utes north and longitude 12? degrees 44
minutes west. The boat was, seen about
3 p'clock in the afternoon and soon there
after was hoisted I on board. (
Everything on the boat seemed to be
in perfect order. The life preservers were
In place and tied .to the thwarts, . There
was a cask of water, and a pint- bottle of
whisky in the bottom . besides a. portion
of a curtain: Speculation is rife' as to
why a curtain should be in the boat. The
captain of the Henry Wilson did hot re
port the number, of . the lifeboat. Im
mediately after arrival the Henry Wilson
dropped her anchor to the northward of
Arch rock and will come to dock to-day,
The recovered boat will be turned over ta

"Dear Mrs. Pdhiham:â I haye never in' my life giyen what yon
would call a testimonial before,' but you have done so much for me that
I feel called upon, to give you this unsolicited acknowledgement of the
Â¦wonderful curative value of Xydia E. I*iiiklÂ»am*s Vegetabro Com-
pound. For eight long years I had female trouble, falling of the womb
and other complications. During that time I was more or less of an
invalid and not much good for anything. 1 Four years ago I noticed a
book in the hall telling of the cures you could perform. T read it and
became interested, I bought a bottle of I-ydia E. Piiikbam's Vegetable
Compound and was helped, and decided to use it for a vear. but seven
months sufficed to cure me, and since that time I have simply had per-
fect health. Thanks, dear Mrs. Pinkham again, health such as I now
enjoy is worth all that and more."â Mrs. Jenntb (yDcnsnsnoj- 278 East

business was scarce. "After yesterday's ex

take 'a stand one 1 way. or the other and the

opening the weather bureau predicted rain for

slid off to 79%c for May, but skeptical "bulls
bid it up again to 80%c. Â¦ Rain talk and lower
closing cables again pressed prices back, but
the close was steady. May a shade lower at

NEW YORK. Jan. 17. â There was Increased
activity In the stock market to-day, but the
dealings did not rise much over half a million
chares and were largely congested In the few
stocks which were favorites in speculation.
Professional manipulation had not a little to
do with the advance in prices at some points
and the movement was clearly directed against
the ehort Interest, which had been accumulat
ing during the downward course of prices this
Â¦week. The recovery from a recent illness of
â¢ leading operator who is commonly credited
with the leadership of the active forces of
the market on the bull elde was believed to
explain an important part of to-day's transac
tions. The factors which accounted for the
rise were partly in the shape of value Intima
tions and general aspirations and general as
certions. rather than of explicit Information.
Thus, statements were circulated as to the
phenomenal earnings of the anthracite carriers,
which were asserted to reach 13 and 20 per
cent for the leading high-priced stocks. There
â¢w*Â» no difficulty found in marking up these
stocks and there was a very heavy demand at
the same time for the lower priced stocks In
the group, especially the Readings. There were
resulting advances In Lackawanna of 11 points
New Jersey Central, ex-dlvldend. 314, Reading
8% and other members of the group 1 to 2
points. The movement was extended In eome
measure by sympathy to some of the soft
coalers. There was continued strength In the
Southwestern railroads as a group at advances
of 1 to 3 points. The Industrials were strong.
Sugar. Amalgamated Copper. General Electric
end the local tractions showing gains of l.to 2
points. American Tobacco gained another 35
points to-day, selling at 235, with a later bid
at 245. This ptock is exchangeable at jar for
200 of Consolidated Tobacco 4s. There is said
to be less than. 6 per cent of the stock still
outstanding. Very glowing accounts were put
out of the rate of expansion of the tobacco
business. American Tobacco preferred gained
6 points. Late In the day St. Paul was bid
up quickly nearly 2 points and other grangers
and Pacific* hardened in sympathy. This late
movement was the effective factor in keeping
the doping firm, as a wavering . tendency had
developed before St. Paul's rise. ..The bulls
had In their favor the prospect of a strong
bank return to-morrow.
The railroad bond market was active and
strong, mortgages of railroads in the South
west being ir 1 particular favor. Total eales,
par value. $4,075,000.

Chicago stood about the same, and reported
some good buying, including liberal orders from
New York. The local crowd seemed to have
sold themselves to a standstill, and the de
mand: was steadily broadening. The North
western Miller said that there was a good de
mand In the winter wheat belt for Cuba and
the South, but a poor demand for the East.
It also said that the condition "of winterwheat
was improving under milder weather. Against
this report, however, was the prediction by the
Weather Bureau of rain or snow in the belt,
accompanied by zero temperatures at some
points, and this brought out a .lot of long
wheat.- New York reported less export busi
ness, with foreign bids lower and out of line.
The same condition prevailed in the flour busi
ness, there being a fair demand for export,
but at bids which were too low.- Â«

every dealer has- far more than he can work
off, . and - the unsold piles In the stores are
steadily growing larger. The best ranch are
freely offered at 22c in lots, though small sales

The Exchange reduced Its quotations to 21@22c

Woolen goods opened lower than expected,
and purchases were enlarged rather than stim
ulated by the declines. Changes were few and
small, yet. there had been such confidence in a
higher, level. that the trade hesitated. Woolen
and worsted yarns tend upward.
Grain reacted sharply from the high point
and a large Western operator was caught with
more than he could carry. Â¦ Fprced liquidation
of this " long account facilitated: the work of
manipulators for a decline. Another unsatis
factory feature was the recent falling off In
foreign demand, official figures for December
showing smaller exports ' of wheat than | for
any month of the calendar year,' although for
six months of the crop year there still ap
pears a sain of about 60,000,000 bushels over
the corresponding months of 1900 or 1899. This
week experts were 4,348,431 bushels, against 3,
408,725 bushels a year ago. Corn declined
sharply, but still remains about 20 cents a
bushel above the price last year.. Exports in
December were only about 3 per cent of the
out go in ' the ' same month of - 1900. â¢ while ' for
the week Atlantic ports sent out 128,674.bush
els, against 4,695,330 bushels a year ago. Pro
visions - weakened slightly in sympathy with
grain, yet the higher level of prices in Decem
ber established- a new monthly record in value
of exports. Great Â¦ activity occurred at the
coffee exchange, where speculators for a. â¢ de
cline were successful, aided by enormous re
ceipts at Brazil ports and American stocks 150
per cent larger than were held a year ago.
Footwear producers have at last made a gen
eral advance of from 2%Â©6 cents. Wholesalers
have not altered lists. . Hides are weaker, which

Near the hospital will be located the
proposed Oakland College of Medicine
which a number of local physicians have
been planning for several months. Con
ferences between the physicians and uls
ters have resulted in an agreement for
reciprocal relations between the hospital
and college.
While the new hospital will be under
the direction of Catholics it will be a non
sectarian Institution and there will be no
religious test for admission.
The plan of the sisters is to begin work
upon the hospital building within a few
months and it is hoped to complete it
before the end of the year. A large force
of sisters, who are trained nurses, will
be brought from the East to take charge
of the Institution. â¢ ' â¢

On the showing of the nusband that he
has been paying the butcher, the baker
and the candlestick-maker as fast as they
presented their bills Judge . Hall * to-day
denied Mrs. Jennie Simonds of Berkeley
$100 a month alimony, $500 cash and $500
for attorneys' fees. Instead Judge Hall
awarded her $250 attorneys' fees, with
leave to renew her application for alimony
at any time that her spouse becomes
recreant. \
Mrs. Simonds is suing John Simonds,
president of the Simonds Saw Company,
of San Francisco, for maintenance. Her
appearance in court to-day was to sub
stantiate a motion for alimony pending
the trial of the action. In reply to the
questions of her attorney she said that
her husband had left her December 9 last
without assigning any cause for his ac
tion. Without a word he left that day. to
go to his office in San Francisco and did
not return. There had been no dissen
sions and she does not know now, what
the trouble is unless ; that her son by a
former husband was distasteful to him.
Simonds, she said, had once or twice ex
pressed the opinion that her son ought
to pay for his keep. She asserted that
she was accustomed to move in the best
of society and had always been provided
liberally with the necessaries of life. '
Simonds was not in court, but an affi
davit was filed in his behalf, in which he
claims that his wife has an income from
property in the East given to her by her
third husband and that he has paid all
her bills since leaving her. / .
Â¦ The affidavit further sets forth that
"she Is collecting $7 a month for the rent
of a room in the home in Berkeley and
also has a boarder who should pay $30 per
month for room and board.
Replying to the affidavit Mrs. Simonds
said that the income from her properties,
which . constet of rentals and stock- divi
dends, is only $155 a year. -
Judge Hall said he was satisfied Si
monds intends to keep on paying his
wife's bills until her suit is determined
and then made the order for the payment
of the attorneys' fees.

the doors of a famous place that have
not been closed to on their hinges for
three decades, the doors that have ad

"Tell me something about the haunted'
houses which are still standing in this
city?" the agent was requested.
â¢ "Now you are getting on dangerous
ground. In these days of well defined libel
laws you can't talk about a -man's prop
erty in a way that will depreciate its
value without paying well for your fun.
Circulating ghost stories about particular
houses, is not calculated to improve their
renting value and the owners might be
able to show that we had done them real
damage. There is one house In West
Eleventh street that is never more than
half-filled because years ago some one
thought the house was haunted and the
story of the terrible ghosts that walk
about the halls at night has been handed
down from tenant to tenant. There are
other haunted houses, but we are trying
to forget where they are, hoping that the
stories will be forgotten. It is generally
difficult to rent or dispose of houses in
which sensational crimes have been com
mitted. Long murder trials in which the
houses figured prominently usually cause
them to remain vacant for, a long time.
"The idea that it is unlucky to live in
No. 13 is rapidly ! disappearing. I know
of but one woman who has given her
house a new number because it was No.
13. John D. Rockefeller Jr.. certainly has
no regard for unlucky thirteen. He will
begin housekeeping with his bride at 13
"VKest Fifty-fourth street."
There was a time when rich men hes
itated about building mansions in which
to spend their declining years. The super
stition started through the death of sev
eral men of . wealth soon after moving
into fine homes, the construction of which
they began late in life.. Some of the finest
homes now building in this city are for
men who are well along in years. Among
them may be mentioned Andrew ,Carne
gie's place in Fifth avenue, between
Ninety-first and Ninety-second streets,
and the $1,000,000 residence which James
B. Haggin is building on the site of 4he

"Real estate men are gradually for
getting most of the old-time superstitions
which used to cause us much trouble."
said a dealer the other day to a New York
Tribune reporter. "The number of houses
which cannot be rented or sold on account
of being haunted or because some terrible
crime was committed on , the premises is
rapidly decreasing. ' We run across .only
a few people who balk at living In house
No. 13. Even elderly men who have made
big fortunes are beginning to believe that
there is nothing in the old saying that
the aged rich man builds a mansion to
die in it. New Yorkers are entirely too
practical to hold to old superstitions; be
sides, the big apartment houses which we
are building all over town are blotting
out the old houses which may have had
histories."

OAKLAND, Jan. 17.â There were no
escapes from jail to-day. At
both the County Jail and the
City Prison the prisoners re
mained quietly In their cells.
Thee victims of a fad that has become a.
mania among the city and county's
gnests are pleased to stay In jail until
the weather moderates, as brakebeam
riding at this time of the year Is very
arduous.
On account of a shortness In the supply
of saws the incarcerated at the County
Jail will put up with prison fare a week
Â¦>r so longer, though their esthetic tastes
rebel against the beef and potatoes that
come to them, three times a day.
Some of the Sheriff's deputies have been
staying up nights lately, so that it has
been something of a problem to get saws
through the bars. The prisoners are hop
ing that friends who are abetting them in
their craze to again resume their social
and economical obligations will conceal a
few of these useful articles in an orange
or piece of wine jelly cake.

died this morning at 2147 Russeil street
from the effects of swallowing a plate
containing three false teeth. The acci
dent occurred while he was eatlns dinner
yesterday evening. In some manner tho
plate became loosened and was swallowed
with food. Death came after many hours
of suffering.
The act of swallowing the teeth caused
severe injuries to the pharynx and
esophagus. Mr. Brothers suffered greatly
and the removal of the teeth through the
esophagus by means of surgical Instru
ments proved a great shock to his sys
tem. An inquest will be held Monday
evening. Shock from Injuries received Is
said to be the cause of death.

days ago on a visit to his family here.
He had been in that country at different
times for six years past in the pursuit of
his trade, that of an engineer. He was
employed on a cotton plantation when bo

The Judge said if the matter had been
practically, before, him he would have dis
missed the case on the evidence and Cap
tain Seymour released the two men.
W. H. White, who is also an employe
of the Market-street* Company, testified
before the Judge that he met Holmes on
Washington street, near Lyon.- Holmes
said ,he had been robbed- and pointed to
Dolan and Porter as the robbers. They
were standing: some yards away. . He and
Holmes met the officers, later and Holmes
told the same story to them. Dolan and
Porter were then arrested. Policeman
Byrne testified that Holmes was very
drunk at the time. Holmes. could not pos
itively identify either of the two men,
although he thought Porter was one of
them. He admitted that his eyesight was
bad. Byrne was recalled at j Porter's re
quest and said that Holmes had pointed
out Dolan as one of the men at the O'Far
rell-street station. It was also stated that
Holmes a few nights ago* had accused a
reporter of robbing, him. The reporter
had saved him from being robbed while
drunk by three. Chinatown "bums."
Albert "W. Porter, arid i James M. Dolan,,
gripmen employed by , the Market-street
Railroad \ Company, were arrested . at an
early hour yesterday morning by Police
men Collins and Byrne at California street

Raymond Holmes, .419 Locust. street, who
claimed that- they had robbed him of his
watch and Ichain and pocketbook. The
men were in uniform and were on their
way home from" work at the tlme'of their
arrest. ; They, both strenuously denied the
accusation and Captain Seymour refused
to charge ! them till the matter had been

At 'last arrangements have been made

Detective Sergeant John Hanley arrived
from Chicago yesterday with the papers
for the extradition of Stickney. alias Fa
genbush, who Is wanted there for swin
dling people by means of worthless min
ing' stock.
Attorney Barnes moved for a dismissal
on the ground that the complaining wit
ness had acknowledged that he had
joined in a conspiracy to *rob the faro
bank, and also that the whole thing was
illegal and no jury would return a ver
dict of guilty. Regarding Carroll and
Stickney. alias Fagenbush, there was ab
solutely no evidence against them.
Judge Cabaniss agreed that so far as
Carroll and Stickney, alias Fagenbush,
were concerned there was merely sus
picion and that was not law. He dis
missed the i case Â¦ against Carroll, and
would have done the same with the case
against Stickney, alias Fagenbush, had
he not been informed that the prisoner
was wanted in Chicago. He continued
the cases against Lane and Sutton till
this morning, when he will render his de
cision on the motion to dismiss.
No Evidence^Against Carroll.
Mrs. Wilhelmina Mellor, wife of the
complaining witness, testified to having
seen Lane three times at her house, and
Sutton once. The case for the prosecution
was then closed.
Archibald C. Kalns, assistant cashier
of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, tes
tified to Mellor having drawn $1700 from
the bank January 2. He also said that
Lane called at the bank and asked about
Mellor's standing. .
. After the game Lane took Mellor to
Sutton's room and in a few minutes Sut
ton joined them. Sutton apologized for
Mellor's ill-luck and remarked that the
game had been a "tough" one, but if
Mellor had $1500 more he could have re
couped himself. They met subsequently,
and it was agreed that Lane should put
up $2000 and "Mellor $3000, and by an agroed
system of plajc they would be sure win
ners. Mellor became suspicious and em
ployed a private detective to shadow the
quartet. Mellor and Lane were to -try
the second experiment January 8. The
police, were notified, and that morning
the arrests were made in room 304 of the
Palace.
5 Mellor testified that he drew $1700 from
the . Canadian Bank of Commerce Janu
ary 2 and that night met Lane by ap
pointment. Together they went to * a
room in the Palace Hotel. The password
for admission was "Two gents from Sar
atoga." When Lane knocked at the door
he gave the password and Stickney, allaa
Fagenbush, admitted them. Sutton was
sitting behind the faro table and Carroll
had a lot of chips before him, as If he
had been playing. â¢ Mellor described min
utely how he bet by the signals, but lost
$1500.
Mellor Was an Easy Victim.
The complaining witness said his true
name was Alfred H. Mellor and explained
that he signed the complaint as "A. Mil
ler" because he did not want his real
name to appear in the newspapers. He
said he was a speculator and money lend
er and came here from Victoria, B. C,
about four months ago and was living
with his wife at 1516 O'Farrell street. He
told of his meeting with Lane In answer
to an advertisement for a loan of $3000,
to be repaid within ten days with $12,500.
Lane broached to him the real object of
the advertisement.' Lane wanted to break
the faro bank through his friend Sutton,
the dealer, who he said owned a thor
oughbred ranch in Yaquina, Miss., but
was financially embarrassed. Mellor said
that he fell in with the scheme as he
was to get 40 per cent of the winnings
for the use of his money, the other 60 per
cent to be divided between Lane and But
ton. He met Sutton In his room in the
Grand Hotel, when it was agreed that
Sutton was to give certain signals to
guide Mellor in his play.
The preliminary examination of "Patsy"
Carroll, Martin J. Lane, E. B. Sutton and
Charles J. Stickney, alias Fagenbush, on
a charge of tricking A. H. Mellor out of
$1500 in a faro game in a" room in the Pal
ace Hotel was held before Judge Cabaniss
yesterday afternoon. Attorney : \V. S.
Barnes appeared for the defendants antf

When the customs officers visited the
storeroom yesterday morning a scene of
devastation was spread before them. The
mongoose had gnawed his way out of the
box in which he had been confined. v De
tecting a familiar odor In a case of opium
he gnawed it open and, not liking x its
taste, scattered the ! contents over the
floor. Then the "varmint" sampled the
tea samples and brought tears into the
eyes of Teataster Toohy by scattering the
choicest brands about the room as though
tea were worth no more than sawdust.
In vain did the customs officials attempt
to seduce or coax the mongoose Into cap
tivity,-and as a last resort Dr. Hallwood
-was sent for. "When the mongoose beheld
his master he gave a glad squeak and
jumped into his arms joyfully, but in spite
of the doctor's indignant protests the pet
snake-killer was taken away from him
and will be killed, or deported at the
doctor's expense.
Surveyor Spear has reported Inspector
Lynch to the Collector for neglect of duty
in having allowed the mongoose) to be
taken ashore. ' â¢ Â»
'. Deputy Customs Surveyor Chauncey
Milton St. John lives at the Occidental
Hotel and heard that Dr. Hallwood, who
had also put up at that hostelry, had a
prohibited animal there. He notified State
Quarantine Officer Craw, and the mon
goose -was taken and placed in the store
room of the Appraiser's building Thurs
day* night.
Customs Inspector Lynch was on the
gangplank of the transport Kilpatrick
when Army Surgeon Hallwood passed
out with a pet mongoose, which he Â¦ had
acquired and trained in the Philippines.
The mongoose is a great snake and
gopher destroyer, but likes poultry and
pigeons better, and for the latter liking
has been barred out of the United States.
There is a double barrier against him be
cause the Importation of any wild or
domesticated animal from the Philippines
is also prohibited. Inspector Lynch al
lowed the animal to land, having forgot
ten the prohibition.

Murphy was also convicted on another
