In conclusion Guthrie contended for a
continuance of the policy which had pro
vailed, he said, during the history of the
.Government of allowing each State to con
trol its. own affairs winout'. interference
on the part of the Federal 1 Judiciary. .
., He. called attention to the fact that no
relief is sought against the Great North
ern Railway Company, or the Northern
Pacific, although both are corporations of
the State of Minnesota and therefore
within the jurisdiction of the courts of
that State. This was taken, he said, a,s
a confession that neither of these corpo
rations had sinned against the laws or the
constitution of Minnesota. He pointed out
that neither of these companies is a - party
to the suit, so.no relief could be granted
against them. \ ' â¢ . â¢
The bill asks the court, he said; to re
strain by injunction a citizen of New Jer
sey from doing there acts which are en
tirely lawful according to her laws, and
which, are sanctioned by Â¦ her statutory
pdlicy, simply because those acts violate
or evade or tend to circumvent the public
or penal or police laws of Minnesota, the
complainant State. There Is, he continued,
no suggestion that the acts complained of
are not entirely lawful in the State of
New. Jersey, or that it is not within the
corporate powers of the defendant corpo
ration as an investment company to ac
quire and hold the stocks of railway com
panies. The sole ground for complaint is
the alleged violation in New Jersey of
certain enactments contained In the stat
utes of Minnesota: Hence he contended
that the injunction prayed for .would be
nothing more or less than an order com-,
pelling the securities company to obey in
New Jersey the laws of Minnesota. ,

outlining that company's position. He
contended that the bill of complaint, pro

of a civil and judicial . nature between a
State and a citizen of another State jus
tifiable in this court, and that no State
can call upon this court to enforce Its

constitutional limitations can enact no legis
lation.which will, protect State commerce and
State traffic against such - a monopolistic con
solidation as is referred to in this' bill. The
only practical way the" State can protect itsalf
is by the adoption of legislation of the char
acter sought to be enforced In this action, and
the only tribunal in which that can be en
forced under the circumstances disclosed in
this bill is the one to which we. now appeal.
It seems to us that there is a controversy be
tween the State of Minnesota and the defendant
corporation â a citizen of the ] State of New
Jersey â which, under the constitutional-pro
vision referred to, entitles the State of Min
nesota to the privilege of the Jurisdiction of
this court; In fact, this' Is the . only judicial
tribunal in which the State of Minnesota can
well assert its claim and present , Its contro
versy against the defendant. - -* **" 1 '"
While it is not a part of the duty of the
State of Minnesota to enforce the rights of the
citizens of any other State and it does not
seek to do so, we ask this court to turn to
those facts of which it has a right to take
judicial notice and it will learn that six of
these seven States through -which these roads
pass have constitutional or statutory inhibi
tions similar to the one 'which the State of
Minnesota now seeks to enforce in this action.
We refer to this only for the purpose of dis
closing the far-reaching effect of this tre
mendous consolidation. If the State of Min
nesota cannot maintain this action we fail
to see how it Is possible for any State to en
force redemial statutes adopted for the pro-'
tection of the' interests of its citizens as well
as to protect its individual rights.
The bill discloses that this consolidation em
braces about 17,000 miles of railroad.- fur
nishing nearly all the transportation facili
ties available to the people of ssven different
States of the Union, which seven Stated.em
brace mere than one-fifth of the entire area of
the United States and nearly one-twelfth of its
population. - ' :'i

In reply to Chief Justice Fuller and
Justice Harlan he said it would be Im
possible to secure relief in the State
courts, as it would be impossible to get
jurisdiction, the securities company hav
ing no resident representative in Minne
sota. Furthermore, he assumed that the
directors of the two railroads would obey
the dictates of the securities company as
the slave would obey the commands of his
master. â¢ .
When Munn concluded the court took
the- application" under advisement..
Justice Shiras asked what the effect on
the management of the two raods would
be if theÂ«4njunction prayed for should be
granted, and Munn replied that the con
trol would revert to the original stock
holders. . â¢ â¢ -. - Â¦
law in controversy had been adopted to
protect the State against the consolida
tion of railway lines which, had been con
structed by State aid. He. called atten
tion to | the fact that the act not only
prohibts the consolidation of railway com
panies but also of railway francihses and
stocks. 'Â¦Â¦. ' - ' Â¦ %
He contended that, the act was framed
to provide a remedy not. only to the State
in its. individual , capacity but also to the
citizens of. the State in their, individual
capacity as well. Â¦ In. fact., the act was a
part -of the - charter- contract when the
railroad corporations came Into the State.
Consequently '.the State .."of Minnesota
could enforce'' Jt' at'" any', place. He said
the securities company could, direct the
affairs of the ; two railroads from New Jer
sey, notwithstanding the effect would be
felt in 'Minnesota. .The charge-was that
competition is 1 and could . be removed.
Moreover, the directors, of the securities
company are -stockholders of the North
ern Pacific : and Great -Northern com
panies, the effect -being; as complete and
perfect a. consolidation: as could be imag
ined. This' wa&> to bei accomplished en
tirely -outside the. limits^ of tire State, but
its effect would be concentrated. upon that
State.- He also attacked .the combination
a.s .a"< monopoly -and as therefore a nui
sance under> the -common .law. He like
wise controverted the laea- set forth by
the opposition counsel that the securities
company is merely an investment com
pany.
Raker then asked the court to order
the clerk to Issue a subpena for Wilkin
son, who is in Texas, but the court re
fused to make the order, saying. "You
might just as well subpena the moon."'
The defense protested against the ruling
of the court, claiming Wilkinson was a
necessary witness. Parks told the story
Of _the night In the hotel almost, without
variation from the account he gave on
direct examination and corroborated the
story of. Mrs, Gibbons in many respects
Mrs. Gibbons swore that her sister who
was hysterical on the night of the lynch
ing, did not make much noise, but Parks
said she "screamed and made an awful
racket." Â¦
"Did you tell him that the least said about
the lynching the better and that while you
were at Myers' Hote! you heard Jim Hall
growling about his guns being brought there
and- that you thought as you looked at Jim
Hall that that big , would not - need
a run very long? DIfi you say that?"
Parksâ Xo. sir; that was not the conversa
tion. George came to the ranch on horseback
and had dinner with Jett Wilkinson and me.
He said that he had been told that there was
to be a lynching and that he had been asked
to take a hand, but that his 6ister would not
let him. and I told him not to repeat the
etory. as.he would get in trouble and be called
as a witness.
Post â Then If "Will McDaniel should swear
that he was on the store porch the night-of
the lynching he would be mistaken, would hÂ«?

Post â Did you 6ee George Courtwright at
Happy Camp the night of May 31 and have a,
conversation regarding the lynching? Â¦ i
"Yes." ' v ' Â¦
Parks testified that he did not see any
of the alleged lynchers around Trow
bridge's store in the afternoon or even
ing. , . u' r
Explains Talk With Courtwright.
Parks proved . to be a peculiar witness |
in the hands of Post. He was surly to a j
degree, flippant and ugly, astute, but]
very attentive. Post failed to entangle
him to any great extent, and the Jn[ or- )
matioh elicited during the cross-examina- 1
tion, so far as It went this afternoon, j
varied but little from .what he testified* to |
under direct examination. ' ' Post asked â¢
him the "whys" and "wherefores" of
many of the answers Parks gave, and
the witness volunteered the information
that he learned a long time ago to mind
his own business and that' he talked only ,'
when spoken to and did not believe any- I
thing if he did not see it. Parks tried to I
be funny on several occasions during the I
afternoon, and ! his manner of answering >
questions delayed :the proceedings. He i
said that he had heard out in the country j
that the Halls had been arrested, but j
did not display any curiosity regarding I
them when he arrived at flyers' Hotel, i
He knew who the prisoners were; they,
had not been pointed out to him, but
"common sense told me who they were."
At one time in the proceedings Post
asked the reporter to go back to his
notes. Raker.. objected to the delay and
the court informed him that he was one
of the. attorneys in the case and not
the Judge. Spencer objected to the re-Â«
mark of the court and Judge Harrington
retorted: . . - -
"Now you are squawking. You're al
ways saying something."
Spencer protested against the language
of the court and the Judge said:
"Mr. Spencer, you're too old a man to
be punished for insolence." .
Witness Tries to Be Funny.
An objection was sustained. This end
ed the- - direct examination and .the de
fense-turned the witness over to the
prosecution for cross-examination.
Post withdrew his objection to the
question of Raker as to whether Parks
saw Eades and Leventon on the road, and
he replied that -they were coming up the
road from the south on horseback he
neared Eades' place.
Raker â Did they Eay anything about going
to Lookout' to be present at the trla! which
was being held- there that afternoon?'
The Court â Raker was never known to obey
the- ruling of the Court. Strike out the ques
tion.
Parks was questioned as to "Bob"
Courtwright overtaking him on the road
at Hapoy Camp on the morning, of May
31, after the lynching. Parks was asked as
to the statement Courtwright had made
to him to the effect that Courtwright did
not go to see the bodies of the lynched
men. The court sustained an objection by
the prosecution, saying that the defense
could not impeach Courtwright by asking
such questions. Raker explained that ho
asked Courtwright certain questions in
direct examination for the purpose of
having them denied by subsequent .wit
nesses. The court ruled against further
questions of a similar nature.
Parks was then asked if he drovÂ« to
Isom Eadea' place on the Happy Camp
road that morning and if he saw "Bob"
Leventon and Eades on the road. An ob
jection was sustained. The defense ex
plained that it wanted to prove the
whereabouts of these men on that; morn
ing. Objections to questions as to whether
or not any conversation was carried on
between' the witness, Eades and Leven
ton, regarding the lynching were sustain
ed. Raker persisted, and asked the wit
ness if Leventon did not say at that time
that- the "hanging was a good Job."
Post here called the attention of the court
to- the fact that Raker was violating the
ruling*of the court.

Raker asked that the reporter read from
his cotes regarding the race track meet-
Ing, claiming the subjectwas brought out
on direct examination. Same time was
lost while the reporter was searching
through his numerous books. It was finally
discovered that the reference to the meet-
The Courtâ That Is a false statement Mr
Raker. I made no such ruling. You <Jrew the
matter of the racetrack meeting- out on cross
ex&mlnatlon. That was the part the court
ruled as collateral rr&tter. ; . -

that the testimony of Hutton is immaterial?
The Court â I have made no such ruling
Rakei" â I move that the court arder stricken
out the testimony of Hutton. The court ruled
It immaterial.
When the afternoon session began
Judge Harrington rendered a brief de
cision as to whether the defendant be al
lowed to testify concerning the racetrack
meeting mentioned In the confessions
of John Hutton and Claude Mor
ris. Judge Harrington held that the ob
jection of counsel for the . prosecution on
the ground that the question asked by
the defense was irrelevant and incompe
tent was well founded, for the reason that
Parks was not named as one of the per
sons present at the racetrack meeting.
Court Eules Against Defense.
Frank Tetreau, who has testified for
the prosecution, asked the witness to go
to Sagebrush Point to see what had been
'done with the men. Later James W.
Brown, Carpenter and the witness went
to the bridge to see the bodies. The wit
ness denied that he had ever met any
alleged lynchers to arrange for a
hanging.
Samuel Parks was questioned as to the
ropes used in lynching and the defense
exhibited several ropes, asking him If
they were like the ropes he had purchased
in Trowbridge's store on the : afternoon
of May 30, and which he said were used
for making halters. The questions were
not allowed, nor were questions as to his
knowledge of ropes in general. The wit
ness was shown the rope used in the
lynching of James Hall and identified it,
but testified that he never had anything
to do with the buying of the ropes used
in the lynching. The ropes -were not al
lowed to be marked as exhibits in the
case.
Parks testified that after leaving the
taloon the first time on the night of the
lynching he met James \V, Brown and
Erving Carpenter on the south porch of
the hotel, and later stood with them In

A long argument followed and Judge
Harrington threatened on several occa
sions to send the jurors out of the room
because Raker persisted in trying to
bring certain ulterior matters before
them. The court said that he would ren
der a decision on the point In question
in the afternoon.
ALTCRAS. Jan. Â£7.â With only an oc
casional "spat" between the court and
counsel for the defense, to-day's proceed
ings In the trial of James W. Brown, the
alleged lyncher, were but ordinarily in
eerestingr. Slow progress was made, Sam
uel Parks being on the stand the entire
.day. The greater part of the morning
session was devoted to argument as to
whether the defense could ask Parks if
he had attended the meeting at the Altu
ras racetrack last June, . participated in
by Jbe alleged lynchers, and arranged for
the object of enabling the men to agree
on a story to tell the Grand Jury. Hut
ton, in his confession and in testimony
on the stand, declared that such a. meet-
Ing was held; that James W. Brown, the
defendant, Isom Eades, Fred Roberts, Jo
seph Leventon and others attended. The
prosecution objected to theÂ» question on
the ground that the racetrack meeting
was first brought out by the defense in
cross-examination, and therefore was
collateral and immaterial, and on the
further ground that Hutton had thus
been maue a? witness for the defense and
that the witness could not be impeached
Â©n collateral matter. The defense claim
ed the question did not touch upon col
lateral matter and that it was brought
out by the prosecution on re-direct ex
amination; that the whole effort of the
prosecution had been to show a conspir
acy and that unless the raeetracK meet-
Ing were disproved it would show to a
certain extent that a conspiracy to lynch
the Halls, Dan Yantis and Martin Wil
son had existed.

Two other boats were afterward . found

Some of the, wreckage is probably from

which went ashore a few days ago. at
Cape Beale, but it Is not Improbable that
the Red Rock may have contributed to

The salmon ship sailed from "Victoria- on
November 29 after shipping a crew at Port
Townsend. She was commanded by Cap
tain Porter and carried a cargo of 80.164
cases of British Columbia salmon for Lon
don, valued at $320,656. . The heavy gale oc
curred shortly after she was loosed from
the tugboat off the cape, and she must
have been buffeted during that gale.
Whether she survived the storm and had
to jettison her salmon and had her buoy
and gear washed away, as did the Ardna
murchan a year ago, will not be known
until further wreckage comes ashore or
news of the vessel' is- received.

carried him to Wrangel. When he left
the steamer his recovery appeared to be
only a matter of time.
Murphy, it will be remembered, with
three others, went hunting on Traders
Island. He was lost and his companions
followed his tracks to where he had fallen
from the precipitous bluff. There all
trace ended, as it -was impossible to reach
the bottom by ordinary means. Several
Indians, spurred on by a reward of $100,
found a path by which they could de
scend to the bottom, and there they found
Murphy, almost dead from exposure. The
force of his fall had been broken by pro
jections on the side of the cliff. The
point at which he was found was 300 feet
from the top.
A miraculous escape from death which,

SAN JOSE, Jan. 27.â Sheriff Langford
to-day learned that the two men seen
back of Mount Hamilton on Thursday
are not "Brownie" and Goucher. the mur
derers of Policeman Robinson in San
Francisco. It is now believed here that
The men who are wanted escaped to the
southern part of the State, and did not
leave the Sunset Limited train in San
Jose.
Pat Condon, formerly superintendent of
the County Hospital, and now a rancher
back of Mount Hamilton, informed the
Sheriff's office to-day that the two men
who were suspected of being the mur
derers of Robinson camped on the Arroyo
Bayou Friday night. He had met them
and talked with the men. -They told Con
don they were on their way to the San
Joaquin Valley, where they expected to
secure employment with Miller & Lux.
Condon says the smaller man was about
35 years of age, and had a dark mustache
tinged with gray. The other was about 25
years of age, five feet ten or eleven inches
tall and smooth shaven. Both men wore
blue-black suits and carried bundles with
them. This Is just opposite to the de
scription of "Brownie" and Goucher. The
smaller of the men wanted is young and
smooth shaven, while the large one has
a mustache. *
The boy with the cart, who was sup
posed to be with the men, proved to be
Condon's son. He had been delivering
milk to the Lick Observatory and just
happened to be along with the men when
Walter Brown met them.
Not "Brownie" and Goucher.
It Is generally believed that the two
missing murderers have gone south. Cap
tain Seymour is having every station be
tween this. city and New Orleans on the
Sunset route carefully watched. Good de
scriptions of Goucher and "Brownie" have
been scattered broadcast over the country
and the police are certain that they can
not enjoy their liberty much longer. Wade
is rapidly convalescing and by to-morrow
or the next day he will be in condition to
be moved from the City and County
pital to the City Prison.
, Thus far the women have thwarted the
best efforts of Captain Seymour's men.
Their haunts are known to the police, but
since the gang abandoned the Turk street
house, the two women have kept under
cover. â¢ . .
The police are still baffled In their dil
igent search to locate "Kid" Goucher and
"Brownie," wanted for complicity with
Jack Wade, 'alias Daly, alias Henderson,
in the brutal slaying of Policeman Robin
son. Since the murderers left the city
several live clews to their whereabouts
have been developed by the police, but
thus far they have been unable to hunt
the murderers down. Every day the po
lice learn something about the diabolical
methods of the organized gang of thieves
of which Wade, Goucher and "Brownie"
were counted as the most desperate mem
bers. The story of their plot 'to liberate
Gallle and Williams, two of their gang
now confined in the County Jail, which
was published exclusively in yesterday's
Call, was an example of the desperate
methods the organized gang of crooks
would resort to in order to free their
"pals" from the clutches of the police.
netectives Reynolds and Hamill are still
searching for Minnie Randolph and her
friend Ida, who they believe can tell
much that will lead the officers on the
trail of Goucher and "Brownie."

There was a clash in court this after
noon between District Attorney Jerome
and Coroner Golddenkranz, resulting ir
the former being struck in the face by a
clerk. Jerome was in the office examin
ing Shaler, Bracken and McGrath, the
men under arrest, when a policeman as
signed to the Coroner's' office entered
and under the Coroner's Instructions de
manded that the prisoners appear before
that official. Jerome allowed them to go,
but he and his assistants followed. In
spite of protests the Coroner gave' the
case to the jurymen, who returned a ver
dict recommending the discharge of the
prisoners. The Coroner then opened
court as a sitting magistrate, had the
men rearrested and held them without
bail. ' More protests came from Jerome,
and the Coroner changed his decision
holding the men in $10,000 each.
AH this had worked up the feelings of
everybody to such an extent that there
was a free fight. Jerome received a blow
in the face from the Coroner's clerk, wtio
in turn was beaten by two of the Dis
trict Attorney's detectives. Then the
detectives and the clerk* had each other
arrested, but soon better counsel, pre
vailed and all charges were withdrawn
for the present.
Moses Eppes, a powder man in charge
of the shanty where the explosion oc
curred, Is at the Flower Hospital suffer
ing from contusions and shock. He says
that on going to the shanty about mÂ»oa
he found a candle, which he had left
lighted on a shelf, lying on the floor and
some paper which was about it was on
Ore. Close to this burning pape'r were
thirteen boxes of dynamite cartridges,
each box containing from sixty to sev
enty-five cartridges. Eppes threw a pail
of water over the floor and ran to get
another one. On coming back he saw
that the flames were close to the dvna
mite, and, dropping his pail, he tried to
get away. Then came the explosion, and
the next he knew he was a patient in
the hospital. To-night Eppes was prac
tically a prisoner, a policeman having
been assigned to guard him.
The damage may exceed $1,000,000. The
first estimate of the damage to the Mur
ray Hill Hotel placed the loss at $100,000,
but later the hotel was abandoned as un
safe. If the building is condemned the
loss on it alone will approximate $1,000,
000. The damage to the Grand Union was
estimated at $40,000, and that to the Man
hattan Hospital at $25,000. The loss at the
Grand Central station was entirely In
glass, as was that of the hundred or more
buildings affected by the explosion. No
estimate was made of the losses sus
tained by the Rapid Transit contractors.
W. Barclay Parsons, chief engineer of
the Rapid Transit Commission,, said
that Shaler was one of the most compe
tent and careful engineers he ever knew.
District Attorney Jerome visited the
scene and made an investigation to guide
him in the official inquiry and possible
criminal prosecution that will follow. .
Ira A. Shaler, engineer-in-chief in charge
of the work at Park avenue; John Brack
en, a foreman, and Martin McGrath, an
assistant foreman, were placed under ar
rest, charged with homicide.
The sunken approach to the street rail
way tunnel used by the Madison-avenue
lines cuts through Park avenue and the
shaft of the Rapid Transit subway was
run down beside it at the intersection of
East Forty-first street. The street rail
way approach was housed over with a
superstructure used for the operating
plant of the Rapid Transit contractors.
Temporary buildings for storage pur
poses were thrown up against the super
structure at the mouth of the shaft, and
there the explosion occurred. It tore a
great gorge In the street, demolished the
temporary buildings and part of the su
perstructure and sent a mass of earth,
splintered timber and twisted iron hign,
in the air. Much of it went battering
against the front of the Murray Hill Ho
tel, and although the walls and main
structure of that building stood the shock
nearly every room in the front of the
house was wrecked.

construction of an. entire new main line
of track from a point on the' present main
line on the Snohorriish Oliver above Ev
erett, to approach Seattle from around
the northtvest corner of Lake Washing
ton, leaving the shores of Lake Wash

crossed by Madison street, finally enter
ing a tunnel in the neighborhood of
Twenty-fifth avenue and East Union
street. The other end of the, tunnel will
be in the vicinity of the Hill brictcyard in
Rainier Valley. "Across the valley the
road will proceed on the present ground
level, and, entering a second tunnel un
der Beacon Hill, will emerge on the tide
flats at a point but a short distance south
of the site which has been agreed upon
for the Union passenger station. !
No detailed estimates of the expense ~ot
the construction of the proposed improve
ments are at hand, but the tunnels will
aggregate nearly two miles in length and
will cost upward of $1,000,000. The other
improvements will cost $530,000 more, ex

Some opposition developed against
jrranting a permit for an amateur exhibi
tion to the Yosemite Club, and Corbett
Â¦withdrew the application.
The resolution granting the Bay City
Athletic Club permission to hold an ama
teur boxing exhibition on January 28 was
adopted, with the understanding that the
club join the Pacific Athletic Association.
James Neil, president of the Pacific
Coast Athletic Club, had filed a protest
against the granting of a permit to the
Yosexnlte Club for February, on the
ground that it does not comply with, the
ordinance, inasmuch as it has no gymna
sium or membership. Xeil claims that Jiig
club filed an application first, and under
the constitution he is entitled to the per
mit. The protest was read, but the per
mit was granted to the Yosemite Club,
there being fifteen votes in its favor. It
Is provided that the permit may be re
voked if the contest shows evidence of
collusion or fraud.
. Wjron argued in favor of permitting the
representatives of all three clubs to be
heard. . Â¦
Curtis deplored the fact that he is a
member of the Police Committee; because
he could eee trouble ahead. Curtis eaid
the prize-fight question was too small a
matter to take up the time of the full
board, and held that the decision as to
which club should be. granted a permit
ought to be left to the committee. . Curtis
t>aid he would vote against giving a per
mit to any club with which Kennedy was
connected, and he had been assured by.
Harry- Corbett that Kennedy was not in
terested in the Yofemite. A motion to
give all parties interested a hearing was
lort.
Eggers made a plea for Harry Corbett.
president of the club. and.. said he was
rare an honest exhibition would be given.
Connor stated that opposition to the
Yosemite Club had ?>een engendered be
cause of the supposed connection with it
of Jim Kennedy, an Eastern fight pro
moter. Connor assured the board that
Kennedy was not connected with the club.
D'Ancona desired to know the reason
why preference was given to the Yo-
Kemlte Club. Chairman Boxton of the Po
lice Committee explained that the Na
tional, Pacific Coast and Yosemite Clubs
had applied for permits In February and
the claims of each had been considered.
Boxton said the committee had acted in
all fairness and that no partiality was in
tended. The Yosemite Club had depos
ited its license tax of $1200 with the Tax
Collector Â»nd the other clubs had not
done so. Boxton held therefore that the
clab named should get the permit. '
The resolution granting the Yosemlte
dub permission to hold a professional
boxing exhibition in February was adopt
ed by the Board of Supervisors yesterday,
but only after a long discussion was had
over the claims of rival clubs to have the
February privileges

CHICAGO. Jan. 27.â Rube Ferns, the
former welter-weight champion, won a
decision over Tim Murphy of Australia
at the American Athletic Club to-night.
The fight was a disappointment, both
men being unusually wild in their deliv
ery. Murphy appeared to be afraid of
Ferns and the latter was compelled to
chase the Australian all over the ring to
land a telling blow. Even when Murphy
did stand up and fight Ferns was unable
to do much damage, as his blows were
principally wild swings, which Invariably
encircled Murphy's neck. Murphy landed
but one effective blow during the entire
six rounds.

Sir Thomas said that the worst
enemy the British soldier had to
fight against in South Africa was dis

among the soldiers, owing to bad water.
The hospitals are modern and well con

men dying every day through racking
fever than from bullets received in en

termed it. "base hospitals") maintained at
Newcastle, Ladysmlth and Escourt. All
these institutions are crowded. The emi
nent surgeon says that the Boers use
the Mauser rifle and that in some in
stances he noticed that the Boers filed a'
sharp and yet jagged edge to the end of
their bullets, which made the wound, of
any person shot with, this missile hard to
cure. ...

A challenge from Rufe Turner of Stock
ton to fight the winner was read at the
ringside.
.While the fight was looked upon as one
that would raise the winner' in the esti
mation of the sporting public, it is the
idea of many that Hegarty's success to
night will not be njuch of a feather in hi3
cap, as he came "touted" as a world
beater and was believed to be able to put
Heriera away in quick order. The fight
gave general satisfaction owing to itis
cleanness and the cleverness displayed by
both men. Herrera, who had gone back
considerably in the estimation ot his
former admirers in this city since his de
feat at the hands of Terry . McGovern,
made up for lost ground to-night and was
heartily cheered for his success in hold
ing off the fighter from across the water.

himself out of tight corners. . - - -
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 27.â In the twen
ty-round contest at the Scribner'Opera
house' here to-night Tim Hegarty, the
Australian boxer, gained a decision over
Aurelio Herrera. "Jack" Welsh refereed
the bout; and' while many were of tha
opinion that there wa3 riot much to choose
from between the two men the decision
was just. From the first up to, the tenta
round Hegarty did ell the leading. . and
although Herrera blocked most of the
blows Hegarty's confidence was in his
favor. In . the eleventh round . Herreru.
tried hard to make up for lost ground and
did . some vicious^ in-flghting. j Hegarty
proved to be his equai at this game, how
ever, and honors were easy.

Dr. Boyle, a 15 to 1 shot, with Mounce
up. captured the closing sprint in a head
finish with Quadra. It. was not generally
supposed '.the Doctor possessed tne
requisite amount of class, and he went
out and led from the start. Dangerous
Maid, the 1 to 3 favorite, backed up in
the stretch, even losing the show to Cen
sor. ;
Bookmaker Caesar Young's Meehanus
was clearly outsprinted -by Duckoy .in
the six- furlong selling number. The lat
ter's odds were backed down to 1 to 2,
and led almost from the start. Meehanus
took some hard riding to beat Captivate
,for the place.
Jackson repeated his first success with
Orfeo in the two year old dash at three
and a half furlongs, earning a nose deci
'sion from Ora Viva, ridden by Tommy
Burns. The winner closed equal favor
ite with Hudson, and had the' best racing
luck throughout, never meeting with any
interference. O'Connor on Hudson was
cut off just after the start, then finishing
a good third.
Bragg, with Roscoe Troxler in the sad
dle, left Vasallo, Quiet and all the short
priced ones behind him in the third
event, a seven furlong selling affair.
Vasallo, the favorite, was looked upon
In the light of a certainty, still had to
be hard ridden to get the show. Tyranus,
piloted by O'Connor, took place honors.
Plunger Lewis sent a good-sized com
mission into the ring on Rey Dare, and
saw MacGyle win easily. Rey Dare
led until well into the straight for home,
where MacGyle, backed down to favorit
ism,- took the lead,- scoring by two
lengths in 1:43'A Old Joe Ripley was
third.

The responses of the California repre

Probably those who have not had time to
auswer-wlll be heard from in a day or

Responses have been received by Secre
tary,. Filcher of the State Board of Trade
f r om representatives of California In Con
gress in "response \to communications sent
to. them relative to reciprocity matters
at Washington. .With Secretary Flloher's
letters he sent to- each Senator and Con
gressman from California a copy of a set
of resolutions, adopted by the State Board
of Trade at the last meeting of that body,
which constituted'a memorial asking the
California delegation to oppose abatement
or removal of the present tariff rates
upon Cuban sugar.' and tobacco and such
reciprocity agreements with other coun
tries as abate the rates on citrus and
other fruits of California and upon other
products of the soil of the United States:
also setting forth that the proposed
changes In favor of Cuba are inimical to
the Interests of the farmers of this State
and of the whole country.
Reciprocity Is Opposed

After the report had been read in open
board Boxton moved to take up the
ordinance, because a number of business
men who desired to be heard on the
subject were present. Braunhart object
ed to taking the measure up out of
order, and Comte moved that considera
tion be deferred one week. Cbmte said:
I read in the newspapers that the ordinance
had bÂ«en laid over for one week by the Police
Committee. A delegation of citizens waited on
me In my office regarding the matter, and I eo
informed them, alter first hearing from the
clerk's office. The delegation would have been
here this afternoon, but believing that the reg
ular meetings of the Police Committee are held
on Thursdays they did not come to-day. Every
body who wants to be heard* should have a
chance, and I move the matter be fixed for
hearing: next Monday, so both can submit their
arguments.
Boxtcn replied:
There is nothing that regulates the meetings
of the Police Committee ' and the members of
the board should certainly have no objection to
placing themselves on record on the subject.
The motion to postpone for one week
was passed by the following vote:
Ayes â Booth. Brandenstein. Braunhart,
Comte, Connor, Curtis, Payot, Wilson, Wynn.
D'Ancona â 10.
Noes â Bent, Boxton, Eggers, Lynch, McClel

The Supervisors' Police Committee held
a special meeting ' shortly before the
board met in regular session yesterday
and recommended the passage of the
proposed ordinance permitting pool sell-
Ing on horse races within the track in
closure for a period of sixty days in any
calendar year. The bill. if passed will in
sure the opening of Ingleside race track.
Supervisors Boxton and Eggers signed
the report, Curtis, the third member of
the committee, being unable to be pres
ent. . Â¦ .
From end to end of the Sacramento and
fan Joaquin valleys the farmers are dis
cussing' the organization the wheat grow
ers are busy perfecting. G. Wi Pierce,
presideut of the temporary organization,
says that the farmers have been selling
prain at a loss, and that they have every
thing to win and nothing to lose by or
pssiizinfr. Wheat growers are not making
money, and the time has arrived for them
to do something in their own behalf. A
systematic canvass for subscriptions to
the plan of organization for farmers has
been made throughout the State. . He con
siders the proposition simple. In an ad
dress that he has just put out he says:
"The grain grower is asked to have his
prain shipped to foreign markets, wher
ever they may be. over lines designated
by the association. In other words, we
Â¦want a freight carrying line of ships sail
ing from Port Costa to Liverpool and the
Orient which will charge only living, rea
sonable freight rates. By united action
Â¦we can secure such a line and make a
great saving. For many months we have
paid from fS to 111 per ton freight on our
grain to Liverpool. The shipping of our
crops was considered a good business
when we paid but from S5 to $6 per ton.
Combinations have been formed that are
seriously crippling us.
"The profits from our produce, which
legitimately belong to us, now go to oth
ers. Combination did it. Combination be
gets combination. The challenge is out.
Shall we accept it, organize and have a
royal battle, with the prospects of suc
cess in our favor, or shall we continue to
be the slaves of those with foresight
enough to organize and properly prepare
for the contest? There is no doubt that a
co-operative society, handling the grain
crop for a number of years and so man
aged as to secure the confidence of finan
cial men. could effect a great saving to
the producer. If the. proposed association
accomplishes anything It will be to en
hance the value of our grain, both wheat
and barley, from $2 to $5 per ton. It will
also be in a. position to do much for the
farmer that cannot be represented in dol
lars and cents. Our business is of suf
ficient magnitude to entitle it to a higher
piane than the one on which It is now
operated."

"I want to know when my brother asked
him the direction of the streets why he
didn't walk down with him and see tf
there wasn't such a number. He might
have known that my brother was a hay
.seed and didn't-know anything about the
city and never carried a gun in his life." .
For reply Crackbon repeated the con
versation that he had had with Pedro.
Crackbon admitted that he was not in
uniform/but said that when he told Pedro
that he. was a police officer he pulled
aside" his. overcoat and exhibited his star.
Dr.. Li. D. Bacigalupl testified that he
made the autopsy on the body of Pedro,
and that the bullet had an inclination of
more than forty-five degrees, ranging,in
ward,-upward and backward and lodging
-behind the breastbone. It was his opinion
that the bullet struck the pavement and
then entered the body. It was impossible
that the bullet could have been fired from
B the level. ., â¢ . - 'Â¦ ''.-Â¦Â¦.
-F. Jones, the driver for the Great East
ern Dairy, testified that Â¦when Crackbon
overhauled him he asked Crackbon who
he was.
"He poked his gun in my face," said
"I, wanted to know who he was,
?"but all I couldget out of him was that:
I he -wanted to know what I -was doing."
. This concluded the testimony and the
1 jury retired and agreed upon the forego-
I ing verdict. 1 - ' ' . : ' ,;
At this stage of the proceedings - the
brother of Pedro asked permission to
question the officer.
Brother Questions Officer.
"My only intention' was -to stop him,"
said Crackbon.. "The only thing that
seemed to frighten him was when I told
him I was a police officer and showed him
my star. If I was a citizen and a man
put his hand Into his back - pocket like
that and I had a gun I. would plant it into
him. I believe the, law is thafthe police
officers are in command of the streets and
the people, and when the' command is
given him by a police. officer to halt if he
is a gentleman and a ctiizen and expects
protection he will obey and will appre
ciate it. I believe that if I had fired di
rectly at him I would riot be justified. If
I had fired into the air the ball would be
likely to go into the third storj* of. some
building and kill somebody." /v.'-tt;';-*'
The witness then told how he searched
for Pedro and was unable to find him, and
how he telephoned to the police station
that he had shot at a man.- He told his
brother : officers that he had shot at ; a
man, but did not know" whether or not. he
had hit him. â¢.
, " '1911,' he said,~and'I said; 'There's no
such ' number. Are you a stranger here?'
'No, sir,' * said . Pedro, , 'I have. been here
this last time â¢ between' -five and Zslx
months.' I said, -'I am a police '. officer,'
and took one step down, and he backed up
to the edge of the side walk, quickly, and
went down into.hls hip pocket. I covered
him with my- pistol and said. 'Take your
hand off that, quick, or. I'll kjll- you.' He
turned away; and ran stooping forward.
I then shot into the sidewalk about twen
ty feet in front'of me, and he was about
forty feet away. 1 1 heard him make a
sound like. 'ugh,'. and he ran around <the

for weapons, suspecting Jones of being a

the officer noticed-Pedro :,walklng along
Mission street, on the same side and a lit
v tle ahead of. them. v-When-* Crackbon left
the milk driver he saw Pedro standing at
the entrance to Pattosleh's carpet Btore.
The officer, as he expressed it,'- "sneaked
along" the southwest corner of Mission
and Sixteenth 'streets,' and- Pedro turned
around and came right back toward him.
Crackbon stepped into the " shadow of a
doorway and watched. him, and when. he
got about twelve or fifteen , feet the of

The secretary was instructed to notify
every member of the association to at
tend the l meeting and lend- their aid in
securing the passage of the resolution
allowing a limited season of racing in the
city and- county of San -Francisco.
The association willalso present a pe
tition to the, Board ' of. Supervisors to

automobiles are driven over, the principal
streets of this city : ahd county and' - to

The discussion was an interesting one.
Dr. Dalziel. who introduced the resolu
tion, told of the importance of advocating
the reopening' of the track. Ho stated
that It would not only benefit the city,
but would aid every member of the or
ganization. The speaker called attention
to the fact that there was racing on
every side, and if other counties were to
benefit by It he was of the opinion that
San Francisco should likewise be bene
fited.
E. G. Pierce, J. J. Doyle, E. R. Pease
and Mr. Holland, leading members of the
organization, were in accord with -Dr
Dalziel. They all favored the passage of
the resolution and said, they would -do
everything in their power to secure the
reopening of the track. .
The chairman appointed the following
committee to go before the board on
Monday next ' and appeal to the Super
visors to pass the resolution: E R

Resolved, That each and every member of
this association appear in person and advocate
the passage of this resolution next Monday.
The decision of the question regarding
the registration for the primary election
it is said will possibly be applied to the
question of a special election for a bond
issue for the acquirement of public utili
ties as suggested by the last administra
tion. If the same theory holds good, it
will be a long time before the voters of
San Francisco will be called upon to vote
upon a bond Issue.
joining counties shall be conducted within the
city and county of San .Francisco so as to re
sult in the expenditure of. a portion of the
moneys incident' thereto within said city and
county; now, therefore, be it
Resolved. That we, the Stable' and Carriage
Owners' Association, are heartily in favor of
said resolution, inasmuch as it will be of ma
terial benefit to the members of the associa
tion and result in the expenditure of at least
$100,000 per month within this city and county
that is now being expended In adjoining coun
ties, and thereby benefit the city and county in
general; be It further Â¦ ..
I advise therefore that your board proceed at
once to a new registration and. that all pos
sible effort be made to make such registration
as full as possible prior to the primary elec
tion in August, .and that notice be given that
such new registration alone will be used at such
primary election.
Ad\rises New Registration.
The law requires a complete new registration
beginning with. the first day of this year, and
such registration may in fact be "completed in
point of time sufficient to permit of Its use"
at the primary election in August. It may be
that a primary election held upon the theory
that only supplemental registration was neces
sary would not be thereby invalidated, but I am
satisfied that it was not the intention of the
Legislature to permit the use of hold-over affi
davits of registration when such use could be
avoided.
A complete registration may properly be de
fined, I think, as one wherein all entitled to
register have been given full opportunity to do
bo after ample notice. A new registration is a
registration de novo, a registration independ
ent of all others, one I not supplemental to any
other. A new and complete registration would
be one that was entire In itself and contained
the necessary data concerning all voters who
presented themselves for registration, ample
notice being given to all voters that such regis
tration was necessary and was proceeding as
the law required. This character of registra
tion may be as easily 'obtained, in my Judg
ment, prior to the date of the primary election
in August as It would be prior to the general
election in November. That Is to say, there is
abundantÂ«tlme for a full new registration be
fore the primary election, and therefore I do
not fee! that we would be justified in falling
back upon that language in section 1366 supra,
which permits the use at certain primary elec
tions of a registration partly old and partly
new. â¢ .
Defines Registration.
I do not take it to have been the intention
of the Legislature that when a ful new regis
tration is possible for a primary ur any other
election the older registration shall be used. A
complete registration of "all'.,' voters is not to
be expected, for some do not care to register,
others may not have the opportunity and others
may neglect to do so. . Therefore I assume
that' the law does not use the word "com
pleted" as that word is used in section 1366
supra, or the word "complete" as used in sec
tion 1004 supra, in an absolute sense, as mean
ing a registration of all who may be entitled to
register.
It would be manifestly impossible to obtain a
complete new registration of the voters in any city
alter the first day of January of an even-num
bered year in time for a'primary held six weeks
prior, to the city election, it such city election
came within the first three or four months of
the year. Therefore the law has provided that
where such new registration could not be com
pleted in time a full new registration should
not be required, but that in such cases the. old
registration â that of the last general election â
should be supplemented by such new registra
tion as might be made and additional indexes.
The last quoted provision is obviously made
to meet the necessities of elections coming so
early in the year as to make it impossible to
Eecure a full registration of voters. Many
cities hold their municipal elections in the early
portions of the year and for these the law has
made provision in section 1362 of the Political
Code, wherein it is said: "la any year when
by-law an election is to be neia in any city or
town of this State for the purpose of electing
city or town officers, primary elections for the
election of delegates to such city conventions
shall be held on the sixth Monday next preced
ing the election for such public officers in such
city or town."
Made to Meet Necessities.
The Smith law, so called, under which regis
tration is now conducted, provides for "a new
and complete registration" in each ev.en-num
bered year. "Such shall begin on
the first day of January of such years" (section
1094 of the Political Code). The primary law
of 1901 requires that primary elections shall
be held on the second Tuesday in the montn
of August in each even-numbered year for the
election of delegates to the State, district and
local conventions (1362, Politcal Code).
The question now. arises wnether the regis
tration for the primary - election j should be a
partial or a complete registration, it being pro
vided in section 136G of the Political Code
"that where a new registration pursuant to
law is not completed in point of time sufficient
to permit of its use. at the next ensuing pri
mary election, then the original affidavits of
registration and indexes used at the last general
election in any county or city and county - in
this State may be used at any primary election
together with the original affidavits of registra
tion since the last election and supplemental
indexes, showing all additional registrations,
changes and corrections made since the last
general election registration, completed to and
Including the tenth day prior to the primary
election, which shall be the last day on which
any person may register or transfer | his regis
tration to entitle him to vote at any such pri
mary "
Gentlemen : In answer to your question,
'â¢Can the registration of 1900 and 1901, with
the additional registrations and changes, to and
including August 2, 1902. be used for the pri
mary election to be held August 12, 1902, or
must the register to be used at the said primary
be made up from the registration of this year,
1902, under section 1094 of the Polltcal Code?"
I submit the following:
City and County Attorney Franklin K.
Lane has replied to the request of - the
Board of Election Commissioners for an
opinion regarding the necessity of a new
registration prior to the coming primary
election. He reviews the law as follows:
The brdinance ordering the " construc
tion of the extension of the Army street
sewer from San Bruno avenue to Islal-j
Creek, at a cost of $32,000, was finally
passed.
The ordinance granting a permit to
erect bay windows on a building on "Wil
liams street was finally passed. . Curtis
explained that an ordinance was .now in
effect prohibiting bay windows on streets
less than thirty-five feet in width. Bran
destein raised a point of order that; a
permit could not be - granted to violate
an ordinance, as Williams street is less
than thirty-five feet wide. - . '. . .
The bill declaring that public interest
demands the acquisition of a children's
playground south of Market street was
recommitted to .the, Public/Utilities Com
mittee. Braunhart said ,it would be "a
waste of money to pass the measure ".o
print, as the charter required that with
in two-weeks an ordinance must be
passed submitting to the people the ques
tion â¢ -whether a bond : election . shall. <* be
called. * Braunhart- thought the . other
declaratory ordinance would have to go to
print again and advised delay until the
City Attorney's opinion is received. . '

The resolution directing the Board v oC
Public Works to remove the canopy and
furniture in the court room now occu
pied by Department 6 of the Superior
Court, and to place the court room in the.'
possession of the. Public Library, was
deferred for one week. The resolution
also directs- the removal to the Hall of
Justice of such furniture as may be nec
essary to accommodate Department 6.'
Braunhart explained that Superior Judge-
Dunns had expressed his intention to
move his court to the Hall of Justice,
and the controversy will end. /
The Mayor was authorized to receive
bids for ex-Treasurer Widber's propj5Â£3a

The ordinance prohibiting the ' use by
livery stable keepers of horses or vehicles

Similar action was taken on the ordin
ance prohibiting frauds by Â¦ hirers of
horses or vehicles. .
The County Clerk was directed by reso
lution to call for competitive bids for

Attorney, Baggett addressed, the board
with a request that it direct the Board
of Works to issue a permit to the com.-,
pany to, do the work, and that Â» sixty
days be granted in which to expend $25,
000, as required by the original ordinance;
Baggett assured the board that the road
would be bullf within thÂ« time specified
or the board could then repeal the r fran
chise. The permit had been refused by
the Board of Works, 'because official
grades had not yet been established.
3 City Engineer Grunsky read from a re
port -which stated that grades have been
established on many of : the streets pro
posed to be crossed by the Bay and
Coast line. Part of the route lies tnrough
private property, over which the board
has no control and grades on. about one
half of the route remain to be estab
lished. Braunhart introduced resolutions
granting the company an extension of
sixty days and directing the Board i of
Works to issue the necessary permit.
Curtis opposed any further extension,
claiming that the road is a myth' and
that the promoters have not the- money
to begin construction. The resolutions
were referred to the Street Committee.

MARRIAGE â Honesty, Sacramento,
CaL If you wish to marry a woman who ,
has been divorced in California but seven
months you may go to some other coun
try and marry her, but In California there
have been two decisions in regard to that
matter, one that a marriage that is valid
in any otheT country or State Is valid In
California, and the other that a marriage
In Nevada or other place to a party who
has not been divorced a year In California
is Invalid. â¢ As yet there has not been a
decision of the Supreme Court as to
whether persons divorced In this State
who go to . another State or country to
marry within a year after the decree of
divorce Is valid or not. To be on the safe
side It is best to wait until the year after
the decree has lapsed.
You should not indulge in depraved and bad
acts.
You should not utter injurious -words.

.Warrington will j get what it asks . for.
It seems to have acquired a . habit of getting, all- it
wishes.' The only ' strange thing is that the early
inhabitants when they asked for the I use of -the land
did not fask : the- Government : to "*Â¦ build their; houses
and fence their gardens. -It goes without saying/ we
suppose,' that : the people, -of \ Warrington never ' plant
anythirig unless the seed' is furnished 'by 'the {Depart
ment; of /Agriculture." Uncle; Sani,' ,we believe, -has
but one town of the kind;" but" that is enough. :
It appears from the records that at the close of the
Civil War a large number of persons were employed
at the Government navy-yard at Pensacola, and â¢ as
the yard is at some distance from the town many of
the persons working for the Government squatted on
the reservation and established homes there. . After
a time they obtained permission to*build substan
tial houses, and then their number increased until the
settlement. became quite a- town. /Having reached
that dignity the settlement took to itself the name
of ; Warrington, and the; Postmaster General gave it
apostoffice ;of its own. Like the 'little ; peach ;of
Eugene Field's song,' "it grew/ it grew." At the pres
ent time it has something, like 1500, inhabitants. It
has lights, sewers, , police and : municipal , government
furnished by the Navy y. Department. It Â¦ â¢. has no
trouble with/ politicians and no faxes, and now' it
wishes the Government to provide . it with two pub
lic 'schools. Â¦ . . ' ' 1 "
The presentation of the bill and its reference to the
Secretary of .the Navy* for his^opinion were suffi
ciently strange departures from the routine of Sena
torial appropriations to attract . the attention of the'
newspaper men in Washington, and one of them on
investigating it dug up a very interesting story show

LIVING ON THE NATION^
The clearings of New York are about
two-thirds of .those of the whole United
States and twice (hose of London, and
yet these enormous transactions are* con
ducted without the handling of more than
2 per cent of actual money. By means of
checks and credits, dailjr: balances are
struck and settled, and .to the absolute
correctness of a cent. What^ engineering
feat, -what: - electrical accomplishment,
what Invention of necessity or luxury can
compare with it? ...
:'." Nearly ' two-thirds of these . clearances
and balances -have been within the past
twenty years, and nearly one-third with
in the past ten yearsâ the transactions
for 1901 being fifteen times as large as
forty-eight years ago.
It is $890 per capita for the present in
habitants of the earth, $18,510 per capita
for the inhabitants of the United States,
or $407,229 per capita for the inhabitants o.f
New : York City, where the transactions
took place.
In gold it would make 63,954,741.373 flna
ounces at the present price of $20 67 per
fine ounce, or 75,653,694,500 ounces avoirdu
pois, of 6,304,'474,542 . pounds, or 3,152,237
tons. It would measure one solid Iblock
of 3,328.021 cubic feet of gold.
In silver dollars, placed one above an
other, it would reach '950,000 miles, or four
times as high as the moon. Placed side
by side they would reach 11,400,000 miles,
or 460 times around the earth.
$1,425,294,504,212.â These figures represent
the total transactions of the New York
clearing-house during the forty-eight
years' of its existence,- ending September
30, 1901. It is difficult to grasp the real
meaning of such a sum of moneyâ a mil
lion' and a half millions â a thousand and
a half billions! It is more than three
times the wealth of the whole world, and
would pay the world's debts forty times
over. This money, if in $1 bills and
placed lengthwise, would extend 10.6S9 -
708,7S1,605 inches, or 56,237,941 miles, and
would girdle the earth 2278 times, or reach
to the moon and back, even if It were 100
times farther away than its real distance
of 23S.850 miles. Or, if made Into a quilt,
it would entirely cover the State of New
Jersey or the State of Massachusetts.
With this condition of affairs , it is sig
nificant to note -that manufacturing.' in
.which, so many great American fortunes
have been, made, is still^in Its infancy.
Among the 4441 of Japan's moderately. rich
men' there j are more ! farmers and ' mer
chants than manufacturers and sixty-six
are noblemen. Of this class only about
one . In ',- ten has amassed {wealth ' in , one
generation. . A.'', fortune "usually -. repre
sents the Inherited accumulation i of sev
eral generations. : This; is quite contrary
to. conditions in America," where a fortune
grows'up almost in a night?
Of the quarter millionaires found in
Japan, Toklo, the capital, possesses one
third, Â¦ but eight neighboring provinces
have scarcely any. The other large cities
ranked in proportion to , their capitalists
are Osaka, Kobe, Najaga, Kioto and
Yokohama. " . â¢ Â¦ -.
That, however, is the very farthest pos
sible removed from the facts, for Japan
has no paupers. While there are no fabu
lously rich men, there are no notoriously
poor ones. Wealth is ' very generally dis
tributed and misery and are
so iittle known that the j Japanese are
noted for being one of the happiest, light
est hearted peoples of the earth.
. That means that there is only one quar
ter millionaire to every 100,000 population.
Compared with the United States' 3828
millionaires, or one for. every 20,000 popula
tion,; these' figures make Japan look pov
erty stricken. - :?
The Tiji Shimpo, one of the leading
newspapers of the empire, has been mak
ing an Investigation of the country's
wealth. According to Its tabulated sta
tistics the greatest fortunes only, reach
the quarter-million mark. There are re
ported to be 441 persons whose possessions
aggregate 500,000 yen, which is In , Amer
ican money ?25 ,,000. .
â¢ The modern Western problem of what
to^do with the rich growing richer and
the poor growing poorer isn't troubling
the Mikado's empire. There isn't an in
habitant there, not even a nobleman, who
would be considered a rich man from an
American standpoint. .
Japan presents the curious anomaly for
the twentieth century of a country with
out a millionaire. . . l i

A SNARK-M. B., City. The word
"snark" as used by Lewis Carroll In one
of his works is a creation of his own,
which is not recognized by any diction
ary. His own definition is that a snark
Is a boojum, and a reading of hla book
shows that a boojum Is nonsense. The
only use of snark aside from that In
Carroll's book is by an association of
lumbermen and newspapermen, called
the Concatenated Order of Hoo-Hoo, -with
headquarters in Chicago. The highest
officer is called the "Snark of the Uni
verse," and the head officer In each
State Is called a vice regent snark. The
principle of the order is fun and non
cense. â¢ -1 -^ ;
In Korea eighty officials,; each of whom embezzled
more than $iooo of public funds, have been sentenced
by the yEmperor to be beheaded. This is one of the
cases where a regret for the refinements of a more
merciful civilization might be justified.
Furthermore, Consuls have promoted our trade
interests by. giving advice as' to how , goods should
be packed for particular markets; how they should be, :
advertised and how commercial travelers can be best
employed in extending trade. 'Had the -information -
thus given been-more fully complied with our- trade
would have been even larger than it is. 'Mr. Hal
stead says: "American manufacturers/ have been'
averse to making their goods ; especially; for j the";
foreign. markets they sought, evidently \ thinking. that
if their styles suited. Americans foreigners should -be*
satisfied with them. Fortunately all this is changing/
A second important feature of consular work is the
warning given from time to time, of . the /appearance
in ony market of foreign imitations or frauds, upon
Amt-ican articles. These warnings have shown, for
example, "that Russians, in order, to procure a mar
ket for their own oil, have placed it in American tin
cans and sold it as a native product: It ; has !".* also
shown on several occasions how , our styles were
copied in Germany and how the imitations have been
foisted, upon the public as genuine . American "manu
factures." .
Among the services rendered by Consuls to com
merce a high rank is given to Â¦ their reports upon the
conditions of the markets where they are stationed
and of the best means of promoting trade therein.
The information thus given is explicit and compre
hensive and enables our manufacturers and export
ers to fully understand the peculiarities and require
ments of the. different markets! -The value of the re
ports is shown by the fact that they are now more
sought after by trade interests, not of the United
States only but of other nations, than any other
similar publications in the world.
Mr. Halstead says: "Foreign officials arid 'business
interests already understand how great an aid to the
marvelous commercial expansion oPthe United States
the American Consuls have been. The facility with
which the average Consul adapts himself to his work
is there remarked, ' and surprise is expressed at the
unreasonable fault-finding of critics in the United
States. ' * * * The system is^ not perfect, but it is
far superior to any similar service in the world."
SO much has been said and written of late con
cerning the shortcomings 'of the American
consular system that it is gratifying to find in
the current number of the North American Review
a statement of the other side of the question. Under
the title, "A Neglected Factor in Our Commercial
Expansion," Albert Halstead presents a summary of
the work done by American Consuls and maintains
that to them is'due a large measure of credit for the
recent extraordinary expansion of our foreign trade.
The plea is strongly sustained and justifies the con
clusion that however defective the system of con
sular appointments may be, it has nevertheless
brought into the servicj an energetic corps of work
ers who merit much more commendation than they
receive. ; .

To what extent the force should be increased can
be determined only by experts and after careful con
sideration. â¢ Any intelligent citizen, however, can
readily perceive that a considerable increase is neces
sary. The people are desirous of economy in the es
timates for municipal expenditure, but not of that
kind which would leave the streets .dangerous to
wayfarers and the homes of the city exposed to bur
glary. An increased police force is, then, a necessity
of the situation and should be provided for when the
estimates are made up so that it can be attained with
the opening of the next fiscal year.
Such service is excessive and should not be re
quired of the force. It is apparent, however, that
with each succeeding year the same influences which
have drawn criminals to the city in the past will con
tinue to do so to an increasing degree unless it be
made known to the criminals that their arrest' here
will be speedy and their punishment prompt and se
vere.
Under the charter the city is authorized to main
tain a force equivalent to one policeman for every
500 inhabitants. At the present time the force is far
below that proportion. The result is that in the ef
fort to deal with the influx of criminals the officers
have been to a large extent overworked. In a recent
statement to The Call Chief Wittman in discussing
the situation said: "The patrolmen are on duty for
an excessive length cf time each day. Only yester
day I was compelled to add another hour to their
daily service. The men are now on duty ten hours
per day instead of eight."
We must meej the conditions caused by this influx
of thieves, footpads and burglars. We must recog
nize that among them are many who would as soon
commit murder as not We must confront the evils
that arise from the cosmopolitan nature of our popu
lation and the attractiveness of the climate and so
augment the forces of the law that the city will no
longer be attractive to lawbreakers of any kind. To
accomplish that a larger police force must be pro
vided, and provision should be made for it so that it
can be attained in the coming year.
Like every other community -in the world San
Francisco has to bear the evils that attend her ad
vantages. Being a cosmopolitan city she attracts the
vicious as well as the good from all parts of the
plobe. Having the finest winter climate in the world
she becomes the winter resort of criminals as well
as of men and women of culture. Holding the po
sition of the most important garrison town^on the
Pacific Coast, she has to receive not only the heroic
soldier but those unworthy ones who when dis
charged sink readily first to idleness and then to
crime. From all these sources the criminal classes of
the community are reciuited, and we have among us
a much larger and more dangerous population of that
sort than could be developed from among our own
people.
WHEN the estimates are made up for muni
cipal expenditures for the coming fiscal year
arrangements should be made for providing.
San Francisco with ii police force adequate to its
needs. The present force is insufficient. The men
are now serving in many parts of the city upon long
beats, and in every part of it they are serving long
hours. Their watchfulness and courage have been
amply attested, and yet crime is frequent antl the
criminal element of the population defies the law as
if it had little fear of arrest and punishment.

MINISTER'S WOOINGâ A. O. S., City.
"The Minister's 'Wooing," by Mrs. Har

named was commenced as a serial story
in the National Era In 1851. and the first
named was published in 1S53.
WIT.H the new year in Britain begins the issue of the stamps of the new
reign. The penny; (two cent), which will become the most familiar, is a
bright red, the authorities having gone back to the old color. King Ed
ward VII's head takes the place of Victoria's, whose portrait figured
-on the national stamp for more than sixty years, penny postage dating
from January 10, 1840. For the greater part of her reign the Queen was represent
ed by the single portrait taken in her youth. Opinions differ as to the design for
the face of King Edward, and some find difficulty in recognizing the likeness. The
present issue of stamps includes the half-penny (green), the 2% pence (blue), used
especially for foreign countries, and the sixpenny (purple), 'all having the same
design, except that the 2^-pence stamp bears Its denomination in figures.
PERSONAL iWENTiO*.
The figures show a mineral output in excess of
that of any other nation, and estimates made by Brit
ish authorities confirm them. Thus the London Daily
Mail Year Book puts the pig iron output of 1900 at:
United States," 13,789,242 tons; United Kingdom,
8,908,570 tons; Germany, 8,494,852 tons; Russia,
2.821,600 tons;. France, 2,699,494 tons. In 1900 the
United States' total output. of coal was 245,422,000
(metric) tons; that of the United Kingdom, 225,161,
coo tons; Germany, 109,225,000 tons; Frarice, 32,577,
000 tons, and Belgium, 23,352,000 tons. As to petro
leum, while the Russian figures of last year slightly
exceeded- those of the United States, it' is probable
that the enormous total of 66,000,000. barrels, estimate
for the* year 1901, places the,.United States in.the lead
in the production of that article, "these figures show
ing an increase of 110,000,000 gallons as compared
with 1900. . . Â¦'.-
That.is ; the showing American miners arctnaking
for their industry/ and it "is upon that they ask for
the establishment of a Department of Mines and
Mining with a Cabinet officer at its head. It cannot
be denied that the interests involved are large enough
to justify such recognition on the part of the Govern
ment.. There is nothing. sectional about the indus
try. It is well nigh as universal as agriculture itself,
as there is hardly any considerable part of the Union
that has not an extensive mineral interest of one kind
or another. Sooner or later a Department of Mines
will be created, for the genuine needs of the country
demand it, and the sooner it is provided the better.
The estimates -of, the Mint Bureau put the gold
production ; of 1901 $80,218,800, against $79,171,000
in, 1900/ They; put the silver production of 1901 at
59,653,788 Â¦ ounces, against 57,647,000 ounces in iooo.
The pig iron production is estimated at 15,800,000
long tons, against 13,789,242. long tons in 1900. The
coal production is estimated at, 267,850,000 long tons,
against 240,965,917 long tons in 1900. Of petroleum
the production is estimated at 66,000,000 barrels, or
2,772,000,000 gallons, against. 2,661, 233,568 gallons in
1900. /'Of copper the production is estimated at 595,
000,000 pounds, 265,625 long tons, or about 5000 tons
below the figures of 1900, copper thus being the only
item in the entire list which shows for 1901 a smaller
figure of production than that of last year.'
ESTIMATES of the mineral products of the
United States, just issued by^ the Treasury Bu
reau of 'Statistics, indicate that" the' output : will
exceed .in almost every 'particular that of last year,
arid in nearly: every case those of any other country.
.They will show "that we are the, foremost mining na
tion in the' world' arid that the industry 'is advancing
as rapidly as- that of^ any. other carried on by our
people.;; \ 'Â¦:Â¦Â¦.'Â¦Â¦.Â¦Â¦.Â¦['''". -'Â¦:.'Â¦ ,-".'â¢. -Â¦ 'â¢ '.' ' v - :" r

"II. TROVATORE"â Music, City. "H
Trovatore," by Verdi, was written In 1333.
We fear that the editor of the Tribune is too in
terested in the gevvgawry of his attire to be worn at
the coronation of Edward VII to look after the logic
of his Writers or the principles of his paper.
Spain was the sovereign of Cuba; we are not.
If Spain visited industrial distress upon^ the Cubans
she misused and abused her sovereign power, as we
will abuse ours if we visit distress upon American
agriculture to make the Cuban planters rich in one
season. We have no right nor power to do anything
for Cuba except keep our promise of her indepen
dence; withdraw our troops, bring home the various
generals" who oscillate between Havana and Wash
ington ij> the interest of speculators who have paid
from $2, to $10 per acre for plantations which they
wish made worth $260 per acre at the expense of the
American people, and let the pampered paupers of
Cuba spend their $30,000,000 a year where they please.
The reader will observe that the logician of the
Tribune informs us that unless Cuba gets free .trade
with us in the next two months "prostration and
distress in the island will continue and be so inten
sified" that the Cubans will be able to spend $30,000,
000 in Europe next year! This alarming condition of
poverty; which will enable a larger per capita expen
diture for foreign goods than the people of the
United ' States indulge in, "will also gravely" imperil
the peace of the island and change Cuban sentiment
toward. this country. If we condemn the Cubans to
the same evils as those they suffered under Spanish
rule it will be only natural for them to regard us with
distrust and animosity."
Greeley founded the Tribune as an organ of pro
tection, and was the author of the policy of giving
agriculture an interest in" that economic system.
Greeley was also a man of strong common sense, who
never wrote rot. Fancy, then, how he would take
this choice bit of special pleading from the Tribune:
"Cuba, prostrated by war, is just getting upon her
feet again. The. first good crop of sugar cane in seven
years has been produced and is ready for milling; if
it is. milled and the sugar is sold a large measure of
prosperity will be restored to the. islands; if not,
prostration and distress will continue and in many
cases be intensified. But the cane cannot be ground
unless a market is found fqr the sugar, and the only
market possible is in this country. This market must
be opened by reciprocity, and. this; must be done
within the next month or two, otherwise the relief
will come too late. A year's delay will, mean the
spending" of $20,000,000 or $30,000,000 of Cuban
money in Europe, all of which under' reciprocity
would come to the United States. There are. other
dangers even more serious. Another year of indus-'
trial and commercial stagnation ' will gravely imperil
the peace of the island. Industrial and commercial
grievances were the cause of the Cuban revolts â¢
against Spain. There is the peril of a change of Cu
ban sentiment toward this country. If we condemn
the Cubans to the same evils as those they suffered
under Spanish rule it will be only natural for them to .
regard us with distrust and animosity. In order that
our waf with Spain shall not have been fought" in
vain reciprocity with Cuba ought to be established,
arid ought to be established now." , s ;
rpHE' New York Tribune ,has taken command
I --of- the -newspaper propaganda of free trade in
;.* behalf of the Cuban junta. Its' arguments are
enough to. make the disembodied spirit of Horace
Greeley wake the celestial echoes with that pictur
esque profanity which usedto melt the type metal in
the Tribune composing rooms when an unlucky
printer mutilated his editorial by a typographical
error. Â¦

CALL READERS
While conceding the' r justness; of this plea for the
consular service as it is, tHe commercial interests of
the country will none the less remain firm in .the con
viction^ that reform is necessary in the system under
which it, operates. f , All .that is proven by Mr. Hal
stead's argument is that we obtain in the service
many.able and energetic men, despite its subservience
to the "spoils of politics. There has never been any
dispute upon that proposition, though, the fact has
often been overlooked by zealous reformers." The
adoption of . the consular bill before Congress
would not in any way interfere with the good men
now in office. . It would have no other effect than
that of. making their, tenure more secure and provid
ing for ;them 'a better system of promotion. -In
short;' the 'service, 'while 'excellent in many ways, is
defective in some things, arid the airri of the reform
ers is to eliminate the defects.

Split hair, harsh hair, lusterless bair,
brittle hair, falling hair all owe their or-
igin to dandruff, which is caused by a
measly little microbe that burrows into
the" scalp, throwing up the ,cuticle into
dandruff scales and sapping the vitality
of the hair at the root, causing the sev-
eral diseased conditions of the hair till
it finally falls out.' Modern science has
discovered a remedy to destroy the dan-
druff microbe, which is combined in New-
bro's Herpiclde, and may be had of any
druggist. Allays itching instantly and
makes hair soft as silk. Take no substi-
tute; nothing "just as gdod." â¢

[NEW YORK, Jan. 27. â There was no relief
from the semi-stagnant conditions of specula
tion in stocks to-day. The stiffness of money
rates, which persisted for some time after
the turn of the year,' has yielded entirely and
the ordinary borrower Is able to obtain money
on call on very easy terms. Returns of sress
i earnings of railroads which began to come in
to-day for the third week in January show
gratifying increases over last year's high level.
To-day's break in the grain markets, while due
to a condition ot ' over-speculation and at
â¢ tributed ostensibly to the large movement from
other countries, warrants a presumption â¢ of
premising conditions for our own winter wheat
crop upon which much hinges. These con
siderations, however, Â¦ were powerless to ani
mate the etock market. There is a very gen
eral agreement that the ultimate decision of
the question of - the , legal standing of the
Northern Securities Company Is the thing
really awaited for the next general movement
in the etock market. There is also Importance
attached to the definite shaping of the Gov
ernment's financial operations. Legislation for
the reduction of the revenues on the one side
or for special Government expenditures on the
other are studied with great attention owing
to their bearing on the' market . supply of
money. The stiffening of the discount rate in
London end the advance In the price of gold
may be a symptom of renewed shipment, of
gold from that quarter, as the Bank of Eng
land is striving to make Its rate effective in
the market in preparation for the coming Gov
ernment loan. Of the special movements in
to-day's market which gave It its whole char
acter that in Amalgamated Copper was most
conspicuous. Haw copper was advanced for
the . first Â¦ time since the attempt to maintain
the price was abandoned by the Amalgamated
Copper Company. The gain reached to-day for
Amalgamated Copper was 2% points. The ad
vance In the price of lead gave strength to
National Lead and American Smeltlnjr. The
United States Steel stotks/ were' lethargic.
There was speculation In Sugar with a final
C&ln of a point. Notable gains In Chicago and
Eastern - Il'lnoi*. New York. Chicago and St
Louis etocuB, Cleveland. C. C. and St. Louis
and Rutland Â¦ preferred were without â¢explana
tion. The market dosed, duller and firm. Â»^ Â» Â¦* >
There was a cessation of laet week's activity

Provisions suffered sorely from the grain
slump. ' The hog market was fairly steady to
start with, but later in the day prices were
somewhat easier at the yards. . ;â¢ This aided to
the terrible. fear for the result' of the coarse
grain . break started holders .. of . provisions,
especially pork, to selling. -May pork at ? one
time was 67%c under Saturday's closing price.
Packers took advantage *f prices to buy some,
but the Â¦effect Â¦ on pork - prices was not r very
Mrenetheninff. Lard and ribs -' rallied â¢ toward
the close and were only a trifle weak. May
pork or*n9d 22%c to 7 V.C lower at $16 15 to
,?16 30, sold down to ;S15 70, , and ' closed' very
weak. 57 J >c down, at *15 SO; May: lard closed
10@12Vic down at $0 37%@0 40, and May ribs
15c lower ?t ?8 40. . Â¦ ;
The leading futures ranged as follows: \v.
The early, strength In corn attendant upon
the cold weather and early . wheat firmness?
was lost in the downward turn in oats.- Some
of ' the loss, however, ' was recovered, , though
not enough Â¦ to give traders . much â¢ hope for
future prices. The sentiment was bearish and
support seemed wantins, even on the upturn
in wheat. Cables were lower to start with,
but it was the oats break that did the trick.
May, which opened a shade to higher
at Gl%c to 61%c, even . sold up to 62%c, but
then came- the drop â a very hard one â to 60%c.
Traders began to talk 50-cent corn â¢ and there
was Immediate danger of the slump growing
worse. Shorts, however, wanted profits and
they covered hurriedly. Wheat .was going up
again and May corn responded to the influence
by' touchlne Glc. The close was weak,' '91c
lower, at 60%@60%c| . -
â¢Â¦Â¦Wheat started out firmly In spite of .lower
cables and bearish statistics. The cold weather
had set traders to guessing ' and May opened
unchanged to Y^c higher at 78%cÂ» to 78%e.
This strength was only short lived, for when
oats broke evcrythinc else broke with it. S In
twenty minutes wheat had dropped l%c and
was sailing at 77c. Frightened- liolders and
weak speculators with small margins had been
forced to liquidate or stop . losses. . Buying by
shorts. helped matters materially, ,and with th-i'
checking . of the coarse . grain collapse May
wheat reacted well. , At one time shortly be
fore the close May sold at 77%@78c. . The close
was â¢ comparatively firm at ll%c, %c " lower
than Saturday. , ' - :
Action in oats developed so suddenly and
with such surprisingly disastrous slumps
that traders were overwhelmed in the turmoil.
The trouble was all over an attempt by a bear
clique- to raii the holdings of James A Pat
-tijn. something like 10,000,000 bushels' - of - May
oats. Patten was not present early, on the
floor and the weakness of Saturday seemed to
give a good Opportunity for attack. . May oats
opened firm enough. under the influence of the
cold weather and strength in other grains, but
this only made the subsequent dropping of the
bucket bottom the more surprising. 'May
started \ic higher r to unchanged at 44^4c to
44c. Seme small purchases sent It up even to
44%c. Then began the onslaught. The tailors
began throwing stun! overboard in big lumps..
The early trade did not expect ' heavy opera
tions and began to gaBp as prices slid Â»1T. Then
the bears took courage and sold short. \. Liqui
dation on an enormous scale followed and
prices blipped away almost lo at a sale. Trad
ers from the other pits dropped the work ; in
hand and hurried into oats. . 'Change went mad
with excitement. Speculators said this -was a
panic if there has been such a ' thing since
1803. May struck bottom at 39& c. Then Pat
ten came into the pit, told the crowd the sell-
Ing was not for his account and began to buy
in all silts. May as quickly jumped back" to
4U%c and the turmoil . was nractically over
within an hour of the .opening. Â¦â¢ There
was still a tense felling present, however, and
prices wavered all durinjr the session Â¦ in ! a
panicky fashion. The close was very 'weak,
l%^li%c lower, at 42%@42Vic. ,
Â» ; *
CHICAGO, Jan. 27, â All pits on the Board
of Trade went wild to-day. A stampede in
May Oats forcing liquidations in all markets
pressed prices downward f in a panicky fashion
and within half an hour from the opening
May*oats had dropped 5V&c, Â¦ May wheat l%c
and May corn l%c. Provisions . also weie sore
hit. Good support and heavy j short covering
brought back some confidence, however, and
the close saw a net loss in May oats of only
194@lT<ic, May wheat ; %c and May corn %c.
Provisions closed 10c to 57 %c lower.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.â An opinion
was delivered by Justice McKenna of the
United States Supreme Court to-day in
the case of A. N. King and others va. the
city of Portland, Or. The tfuit waa
brought to restrain the enforcement of
street improvements as in violation of the
fourteenth amendment of. the national
constitution, but the court held that un
der the construction of the Oregon Su
preme Court the contention is not justi
fied. Tne court affirmed the decision of
'the Oregon court, which sustained the
assessments as legal.
Declares the Assessment Legal.
Let the state pay for education as it pays
for anything else â for work performed. Let
the state prescribe the grade of secular knowl
elge that it wants and pay for it when it gets
it. whether it be given in a public school or 'in
a private or parochial school. '
. Then . let the Catholic, the Methodist and
the, Presbyterian and tha Episcopalian anil
others who want religious instruction to go
along with that of arithmetic and geography,
build ' their schools as they build their
churches, and in them teach ' the secular
branches that are taught In the other schools
and as efficiently, and let the state pay for it
according to contract -and according to re
sults.
The Bishop said that the Catholic
church was doing much for the world,
insisting on an absolute freedom of con
science for all mankind, and that it of
ten was misunderstood along this line.
He offered a solution for the vexed ques
tion of how religion should be taught in
school. Said he:
Religion in the School.
Caesar, or the state, has the right and , the
duty â a light and a duty coming from God â
to regulate the civil relations of marriage. But
the religious, the spiritual relation.*. God has
reserved to himself.
In upholding thia legislation of the Savior,
the Catholic church ia following strictly theso
other words of his: "Render unto Caesar the
things that are Caesar's and unto God the
things that are God's."
As Christian ministers, you and I agree that
Christ has made a law on this matter. We
may not agree upon the exact extent of that
law. You must admit, however, that no just
interpretation that can be put upon the Sa
vior's words will permit more than one cause
for annulling a marriage and permitting a sec
ond union during the life of husband and wife.
If Christ admitted no cause for such proceed
ing, no power on earth has the right to insti
tute one. If he admitted one and only one
such cause, no power on earth hoÂ» the right
to add others to it. Christ's words are clear:
"What God hath joined together let not man
put asunder," and he pronounces as guilty of
a crime those who shall attempt to do so.
All thoughtful men agree that the home and
family are the fountain source of the social
order. The Catholic church Is conferring upon
the world an Inestimable blessing in insisting
upon the sacrcdne3s and the indissolubility
of the marriage tie as the foundation of home
and family. .
Marriage Tie Is Sacred.
At the conclusion of the paper all dis
cussion and criticism were set aside, and,
on motion of Rev. "Will A. Knighten of
the Methodist church, the ministers voted
to commend the paper and express their
high approval of the Bishop's views, hop
ing at the same time that he would meet
with the association again.
"What Catholics Are Doing for the
World" was the subject, and Bishop
Montgomery handled it with tactfuf abil
ity, leaving out all doctrinal points and
dwelling upon some matters of common
interest to which all thougntful ohurcn
people are giving consideration. Among
other things, he said: .-â¢-;â¢--

"Coralie & Co., Dressmakers," a farce
comedy, very Frenchy In Its construction
and dialogue, was the attraction at the
Alcazar Theater last night, and the origi
nal and funny situations afforded no end
of laughter to the large audience. | ' The
plot is simple and Is based upon the dis
covery by the aunt of a young wife of a
note written by a married lady to meet
her at Coralie & Co's. She jumps to the
conclusion -that the . note ) was written to
her niece's husband and the fun begins.
There are one or two risque situations;
particularly in the scene at Coralie &
Co.'s, where a Jealous husband- rushes in
with detectives expecting to find his wife
â¢with her lover, put instead finds her being
measured for aVdress. This change in the
situation Is caused by touching a button
and the Interior of the > room is instantly
altered.'- Coralie & Co.'s dressmaking es
tablishment > is - also Â¦ â¢ a 'Â¦ rendezvous for
clandestine meetings between members of
the two sexes. M. L. Alsop as the sus
pected; young husband threw enough' vim
into the part to make, it interesting and'
amusing. , George Osbourne, as an elderly
husband fond of flirting, was good, and
Frank Bacon, I as Stephen '. Coralie,' . a hen
pecked husband, was very amusing. How
ard Scott and Henry Shumer had ; also
congenial parts. Marian Convere is suffer-'
ing from a severe cold and her partâ that
of the supposedly deceived young wife,
was played by Marg-aret Wycherley .very

Thrilling and spectacular Is the. "melo
drama, entitled "The .Man of . Mys
tery," which is being presented this week
at the Central Theater. It will certainly
please those who delight in the thrill of
dramatic situations and well arranged
climaxes. The play was received last
night by a crowded, house.. The scene
is laid in New York, and centers around
a man who leads a. dual 'life:-. The whole

Zeigler was married about five years
ago to Miss Harriet Baker of this city,
who is now at her home, and from whom
he had been divorced.
LANCASTER, Pa., Jan. 27.â Harry G.
Zeigler, who shot a woman purporting to
be his wife and then Â¦ committed suicide
at Chicago to-day, was a native of this
city and lived here until' three years ago.
He was 26 years old a'nd a son of William
G. Zeigler, station master of the Phila
delphia and Reading Railroad Company.
Young Zeigler served a term on the
school ship Saratoga, and three years ago
enlisted in the regular army and was sent
to the Philippines. The last heard from
him was a year ago, when his father re
ceived a letter dated "Luzon," in which
he eaid he had entered the hospital serv
ice, a circumstance that accounts for his
title of "Doctor."
Saw Service in the Philippines.
Dr. Zeigler and his wife were not known
at the Wellington Hotel. Mrs. Zeigler'a
father is Samuel P. Adams of this city,
â¢who is said to be wealthy.
When taken to the Samaritan Hospital
it was thought Mrs. Zeigler could not re
cover. After an operation, however, she
showed more signs of life, and, although
the cnances are small, hopes are enter
tained for her recovery. â¢Â¦"â¢.â¢ -,
Mrs. Zeigler was conscious for some
time after the arrival of Dr. Rles. She
confirmed the contents of the note, which
showed that the husband lacked at the
first the determination to carry out their
plans. But she, too, failed, and eventu
ally, she said, her husband shot her and
then, thinking that she was dead, turned
the weapon upon himself.
My photograph belongs to your "paper. We
decided to die, but I lack the nerve to shoot
so my wife, Anna, will do it. Send my body
home to 316 West King street, Lancaster, Pa
Good-by. -â Â¦Â£. â¢
A note addressed to a morning news
paper was found in the room. It read:
Leaves Explanatory Note.
The bell boy took her out Into the half
way, saying that her husband might kill
her, and she let him lead her away from
the room. Then he hastened to the office
of Dr. B. L*. Ries, the house physician.
When the latter arrived the husband was
dead and the wife was barely conscious.
"Oh, my husband has shot himself,"
she cried, forgetting in her fear for him
the pain of her own 'wound.
The physician and his" wife arrived at
the Wellington Hotel this morning. They
were young and apparently happy. They
retired to their room and about '3 o'clock
a call came to the clerk's office. When
the bell boy arrived at the room he found
the woman tugging at the door. Blood
was flowing from a wonnd in the back
of her head.
CHICAOO. Jan. 27.â Dr. Harry J. Zeig
ler of 316 West King street, Lancaster,
Pa., fatally wounded his wife, Anna, and
then killed himself this afternoon at the
Wellington Hotel. A note left by the
physician stated that he and his wife
had decided to die together, and as he
lacked the nerve Mrs. Zeigler had prom
ised to commit the act. The woman de
clared, however, that the shooting was
done by her husband.
John B. Potter, Plowright's assistant,
testified that Patrick had shown him a
letter signed by Rice expressing the wish
that after death his body should be cre
mated. The morning of the day set for
cremation he had been called on the tele
phone by Patrick and told that the cre
mation must be called off in consequence
of a telegram he (Patrick) had just re
ceived from Texas, but that it would
probably be held two days later. The let
ter to which the witness alluded was
dated August 3, 1900. It was introduced
as evidence.
It was also decided at this conference
that Rice's papers should be placed in
neutral custody, pending decision as to
who should be in rightful custody.
Charles Plowright, the undertaker who
â¢was called in by Patrick to prepare the
body of Rice for cremation, testified that
he had said to Patrick that it would Re
quire twenty-four hours to prepare for
cremation, and suggested embalming, to
which Patrick consented.
It was after the witness and Captain
Baker had had a conference with Pat
rick that the witness told Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Osborne that Patrick had
said:
"Why can't you get together and settle
this matter up?"
James W. Girard was recalled, and his
cross-txamination continued. He said he
Vwas one of the counsel retained to sup
port the 1896. or Baker, will before the
. Surrogate. If the 1300, or Patrick, will
were to be sustained, he said, his clients,
the William ai. Rice Institute, would re
ceive several million dollars less than xt
Â¦would under the 18S6 will.
XEW YORK, Jan. 27.â The second day
of the trial of Lawyer Albert T. Patrick,
accused of the murder of William Marsh
Rice, brought it up to the point where
the cause of the death of the millionaire
is sought to be determined. The first
witness along this line of Inquiry intro
duced by the prosecution was Dr. Ham
ilton Williams, one of the physicians at
tached to the Coroner's staff, who at
tended the autopsy/ The gist of his evi
dence was thÂ£.t the lungs were congested
and that this was due to the inhalation
of some gaseous irritajit and that chloro
form would produce such a condition of
the lungs. He later said pneumonia
could produce the same condition.

It is further averred that from the time
the Rio struck the reef until she went
down there was sufficient time to tak<?
off the passengers with a crew skilled
and experienced, but owing to the Ignor
ance and inability of the Chinese crew
to understand the English language and
orders expressed therein, and their fail
ure to render any assistance to the pas
sengers, in endeavoring to save life many
were drowned, among whom was the de

The answer denies that the Rio was
tight, seaworthy, stanch and strong, and
alleges that she was insufficiently and
improperly manned and equipped for the
voyage, and was especially lacking in
competent seamen and' officers; that the
master, officers and crew acted with gross
negligence in attempting to enter the har
bor of San Francisco in a thick fog and
were grossly negligent in . . not taking
soundings while the steamer was at
tempting to enter in the darkness and Ihe
fog. It is further alleged that the sea
men were Chinese and were unable to
understand the English language spoken
by the white officers; that the officers
were inefficient and incompetent for the
reason that they were unable to speak
the Chinese language of the crew, and
that the company was grossly negligent
in failing to provide the full complement
of licensed officers.

Anna Lichter Is the psima donna so

used to warble Aida's woes into the ears
of Avedano two years, ago. She has lost
flesh and gained in voice and looks, and it
is only to be hoped that her warm wel
come and the California climate will not
have their usual disastrous effect and
make another Collamarini out of the now
svelte and slender Lichter. She Is singing
very well, with an added ease and taste,
but was probably not in best form last
night, as her work was not even.
The new ' tenor, Harold Gordon, is : a

enough of it, well used, and of very pleas

night. There is nothing much in the part
of Ralph Winston, and Mr. Gordon did it
with grace and self-possession, pleasing
the house immediately. .
Frances Graham has as pretty a voice
as one could wish to i hear, a fine stage
presence and a large, lazy grace that
don't count for quite what they should.
She is singing as well as she used toâ
no betterâ and is in all respects a pictur

The Tivoli "Ameer" is not the Frank

to say that the opera is not put on very

The directors of the .First Nationla
Bank have decided to hold another stock
holders' meeting on March 8, it being ad
mitted that President Brown was in error
in ruling out the proxies held by Colonel
G. W. McFarlane, representing the Anglo-
Californian Bank of San Francisco and
other interests at the last meeting. It Is
understood that Colonel McFarlane, who
has a controlling majority of stock in his
hands with the proxies admitted, will
ha^te a new candidate for president to
succeed Brown.
The motion by' the Government, for a
new trial in the second Pearl harbor case,
against the Honolulu Plantation Com
pany, has been submitted to Judge Estee.
Negotiations looking to a compromise of
other cases, which do not involve much,
are under way. In the Honolulu Planta
tion case the jury awarded $105,000 for a
39-year leasehold interest, with some Im
provements in land which the former
jury valued In fee at $52,737.
The records of Honolulu continue to
show that the police have great difficulty
in looking after Porto Ricans who were
imported as plantation workers. There
are forty of them in Oahu jail now, a)l
serving time for vagrancy. Petty thievery
is epidemic in Honolulu, and there have
been many burglaries and hold-ups. All
unemployed Porto Ricans and others are
being given chances to go to plantations
with the alternate of serving time.
Acting under an order of court issued by
United States Judge Estee, Captain
Merry, U. S. N., is about to take formal
possession of the 561 acres of "land con
demned at Pearl harbor in the name of
the Federal Government. He will raise
the flag on the land and take it over for
the Navy Department. Work will begin
at once on preparations for the naval sta
tion. 'iWc-:,
HONOL.TJL.TJ, Jan. 20.â The steamer
Niihau, which arrived from Kauai on the
15th, brought five Japanese sailors who
had been adrift and helpless witnout sup
plies for five days in a fishing-boat.- They
Â¦were finally -wrecked and got ashore on
the island of Niiha, where they, awaited
the steamer. The men suffered fearfully
with thirst and hunger, and were near
death when' they reached land. They had
been | fishing and had been blown from
land by a gale.
SEA CAPTAINS
MAY HAVE JURY
.Oberman spoke of the numerous fail
ures in' the brewing world. The industry
was thoroughly American, with American
labor at high wages, but he declared that
it was not^reated like other American
industries, v
I Brand referred to the enormous surplus
glutting the treasury and said this should
impel- an immediate performance of the
promises heretofore made that the war
tax should be repealed.
Crane said the present tax was particu
larly onerous \on small brewers and that
its continuance would bring about a large
number of failures.
A local delegation representing the Na
tional Retail Malt " Liquor Association
urged the repeal of the beer tax from the
standpoint of the retailers,
r .This closed the hearing on the beer tax.
: ' Â¦
Failures in the Brewing World.
'At the afternoon session the beer people
were represented by officials of their or
ganizations, including N. W." Kendall of
New Haven, Conn., : president of the
United States Brewers' Association;
George O. F. Berman, Baltimore, chair
man of the committee on federal relations
of that association; Rudolph Brand, Chi
cago, former president, and Robert Crane,
Baltimore, of the board of trustees. Many
members of the House. attended the hear
ing.
President Kendall said assurances had
been given when the war taxes were im
posed that they were for war purposes
and would terminate with the war. There
was no trust In the brewing trade, he de
clared, and , if- large fortunes had been
made in the business it .was before the
Spanish war. He referred to "three men
engaged in the iron industry, reaping
an annual profit of $60,000,000 from their
business." - The breweries had paid : to
the Government in 1900 $73,550,754 and their
profits either had: been wiped out entirely
or reduced to a pittance.
. A.' B. 1 Johnson, recently United States
Consul at Amoy, China, gave as a result
of his experience that the duty had op
erated to stop the shipment* of poor tea
to this country, and that the duty had
fallen on the Chinese dealer instead of on
the American dealers and consumers.
The opposition to the proposed reduction
was opened by W. J. Buckfield, a tea im
porter of New York. He said the 10-cent
duty had operated beneficially in keeping
out the poor grades of tea, -including the
Japan tea dusts, which had been mixed
with other teas. This gave the country
better qualities of tea, and eventually an
improvement in quality would lead to an
increased consumption of tea. He stated
that? the . price of tea would advance by
the removal of the duty, and he said
prices already had advanced in the ex
pectation that the tax would be removed.
Tea People Hold. Different Views.
Thomas Philan and Martin Roch of New
York, â¢ John Moore of Boston, John Ma
gruder of Washington and others spoke
along similar lines in favor of taking off
theteaduty. â¢ .. . Â¦ .'â¢â¢', â¢
' Fifth â As the : country ' is already heavily
taxed on â¢ the principle of protection, it should
not.be doubly taxed upon an article which de
mands no protection.
Fourth â As the tea duty is a â¢war. tax, it
should | be removed how that the war Is over
and there is a surplus in -the treasury.
Thirdâ The poorer classes pay the tax in full
and the better classes are gradually being de
prived of the best tea.
First â The duty is an. excessive hardship
upon the I four classes of people interested â
consumer, â¢ retailer,. . wholesale grocer and tea
importer. Â¦ . â¢ Â¦< Â¦Â¦Â¦:Â¦- â¢ Â¦â¢Â¦-.Â¦
Second â The duty is injuring permanently
the quality: of tea sold and consumed. i>>\"
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.â The Ways and
Means Committee to-day, temporarily, set
aside the- question. of ; Cuban reciprocity
and entered upon the 'question of reducing
the warjrevenue taxes. During the morn-
Ing the tea. interests were heard on the
proposition to take off .the tax of 10 cents
a pound on tea imposed by the 1 Spanish
war. revenue act. This afternoon was set
aside ' for the beer interests. The tea in
terests were numerously represented.
Some, of i those present opposed Â¦ the pro
posed change, and Chairman Payne di
vided the time so that both sides might
be heard. Albert B. Sloan of New. York,
president of the Tea Duty . Re
peal Association, made the opening state
ment. He, summed up the appeal for re
duction as ; follows: :
Hein came to America eighteen years
ago. . He brought with him a wife and
four sons. Hein was never regularly em
ployed at anything, and his means of live
lihood was a mystery until it became
known that he was a remittance man and
that every year a certain amount of
money was sent him from Germany.
Yesterday afternoon Henry Rahlman,
the grocer, called at the recluse's home
and knocked at the door. Receiving no
response he called Officer Ennis, who
broke down the door of the place. Then
the emaciated body was found.
Whether this peculiar man deliberately
starved himself to death or whether
owing- to weakness he was unable to
reach the food are matters of conjecture.
Considering the man's past there is little
doubt that he was insane. His eccen
tricities tend to bear out the first supposi
tion concerning the manner of his death.
-When found dead . Hein was seated on
an inverted bucket, attired only in. his
underclothes. Dearth' of sustenance had
reduced him to a mere skeleton. His
chin rested on his bony fingers and his
long hair, uncut for ten years, fell around
his shoulder?. The uutopsy surgeon said
it was starvation,- yet three feet from the
ghastly corpse was food that might have
kept life within him.
No visitors were ever received, in fact,
none were ever known to call. From what
the neighbors say he had not a single
friend.
His wife died in much the same manner
eight years ago, one of his sons commit
ted suicide, another attempted suicide
and two more are at present connned^in
the Napa Insane Asylum.
Since the death of his wife Hein has
never spoken to a single human being.
When the Morgue deputies were lifting
the woman's remains into their receiver
he requested them "not to hurt her." Then
his lips became sealed in a silence that
was never broken. He left his house in
frequently^-only to visit a grocery in the
vicinity. If the proprietor was not there
he returned to his seclusion!
Were the owner of the grocery present
he would pass him a slip of paper on
which was written what he desired, but
he never uttered a word of explanation.
Children shunned the house when' they
heard of its mystery. It was, a small cab
in at 1201 Sixteenth avenue South. Its
doors were always barred, and curtains
cut from sack cloth, obscured the win
dows. The recluse owed . the .water col
lector $1 each month. When the collector
called a hand protruded from the window
and the collector received his money from
the grimy palm. None of the neighbors
ever saw the man's face except when
necessity drove him to the grocery store.
Then his absence from the house was
short. He never went elsewhere.
â¢ The pangs of starvation brought death
to Hans Hein, an aged German recluse,
as he sat in a lonely, cabin, yet food in I
plenty lay within the fall of his shadow..
The story of the aged man's life and trag
ic death brings out a series of singular cir
cumstances that eclipses these often re
lated in fiction. He has been known for
eighteen years as the "funny man," and
his abode as the "funny, house."
TRYING TO FIND
CAUSE OF DEATH
Nevada rounders assert that the recent
addition of luxurious chairs, warm rugs,
cozy tires and convenient" tables to tbe
Palace Hotel office equipment . signifies
a Senatorial contest in our sister State
quite as interesting as the battles in
which James G. Fair and William Shar
on figured. Newlands, as one of the rep
resentatives of the Sharon estate, is very
properly Interested in the management of
I the Palace Hotel, and whatever comfort
\te may offer in his hotel to his political
constituents in Nevada will be appreci
ated by the politicians of our resident
population. In fact, everything that goes
to the promotion of blissful life in Ne
vada brings a blessing: to California.
The Southern Pacific.
It is common gossip that the new man
agers of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Â¦will not interfere In the Nevada contest
to help or hinder Newlands. but it is sur
mised that the company will neverthe
less keep sharp lookouts to signal any
dang-er - of a hostile Legislature. The
story goes in railway circles that the
plotters against C. M. Hays kindled a
back fire in Nevada to scorch the com
pany and convince the New Yorkers that
ft would not be wise to withdraw the
corporation from politics. The old graft
ers on the Southern Pacific payroll want
to demonstrate in some fashion that
their services are needed. They are ready
to provoke hostility against the road in
order to get employment in allaying the
strife. The railroad programme at pres
ent is to keep out of Nevada politics, but
events may force a change of tactics.
Palace Hotel Luxuries.
stacles, but if they succeed Xewlands will
doubtless capture the Senatorship. The
Nevada Legislature consists of thirty
Representatives in the lower house and
fifteen in the upper branch. Xewlands
â¢will need twenty-three votes on joint bal
lot to gain the coveted honor. It appears
that the gubernatorial contest is in some
way connected with the campaign for
United States Senator, and as there are
three aspirants for Governor the fusion
aspirant for Senator must be careful in
making' his combine. â¢
> ; ;, Th.e Promoters of Fusion.
The promoters of the political scheme to
nicrfre the Democrats and silverites into
one party may encounter unexpected ob-
that Senator Johit P. Jones is ready to r*
tire to private life- His terra of continuous
r service in the Senate is one oi the longest
on record, and his friends understand that
he is more than willing to take a rest.
Republicans of Nevada, however, may in-
Fist on naming him as their candidate
and making vigorous effort to gain con
trol cf the Legislature. It Is quite well
understood that Frank G. Ntwiands re
lies for success on a fusion of the Silver
and Democratic parties.
Gossip of the Nevada politicians is to
the effect that Frank G. Newlands' ambi
tion to represent that State in the United
States Senate will be gratified, j It is said

ECZEMA'S
ITCH IS TORTURE.
Eczema is caused by an acid liumor in
the blood coming in contact with the
skin and producing great redness and InÂ»
flammation ; little pustular eruptions form
and discharge a thin, sticky fluid, which
dries and scales off ; sometimes the skin is
hard, dry and fissured. Eczema ia any
form is a tormenting, stubborn disease,
and the itching and burning at times are
almost tmbearablc ; the acid burning
humor seems to ooze out and set the skin
on fire. Salves, washes nor other exter-
nal applications do any real good, for as
long as the poison remains in the blood
it will keep the skin irritated.

Nichols held \ an inquest to-day over the
body of Joseph McCarthy, who was killed
In the collision of the freight train and
work train between two tunnela . on
Cuesta grade Saturday evening. . The jury
found that the collision was due to a mis
understanding of orders given by. Conduc
tor .Rufus Schraeder,* of the work train,
to- his flagman. Â¦ : The' order -was . given
verbally to hold up the southbound freight
train at Cuesta. \ The railroad, company
is blamed for not compelling such orders
to be given in writing and further for
not providing a proper system:- of signals
on the Cuesta grade, where there are six
tunnels. > Â¦'-Â¦'.Â¦Â¦ ' 'Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ ' . , .;

SANTA CRUZ. Jan. 27.â For the first
time in this State a novel point has been
raised in the selection of a jury. The law
requires that the ' Supervisors select the
jurors to serve during the year and ap
prove them . while sitting- as a body. For
years it has been the custom for each Su
pervisor to file his list with the County
Clerk. To-day C. E. Lindsay, attorney
for Joseph Teshara, I charged with mur
der, raised the point that the manner in
which the selections are made Is contrary
to law. Judge Smith sustained the chal
lenge, and 125 jurors who had been sum
moned were discharged.

Chief of Police Sullivan says the arrest
of Goo 'Ah Jim is part of a highbinder
plot to thwart the prosecution of the
murderers of the Chinese doctor. He says
he has positive evidence that Goo Ah Jim
was not in San Francisco at the. time of
the commission of the murder for which
he has been arrested; that he was in Sac
ramento and had been for thirty days
prior to that date.
The murder of^the Chinese "doctor here
resulted from his refusal to pay a portion
of the expense of the defense of a Chinese
criminal. Â¦ ; . ' , - â¢
Scarcely had Goo Ah Jim announced
this recognition when he was himself
placed under arrest on a 'charge of mur
der, alleged to have been committed in
San Francisco. Elwood Bruner, special
counsel against, the murderers of Dr.
Suey Que Hlng; . left - for Bakersfleld to
day to obtain the release of Goo^Ah Jim
on a writ, of habeas corpus.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 27,-Dr. Suey Que
Hirig, a prominent Chinese, was murdered
In this city early In January. One of his
countrymen is now, in jail awaiting ex
amination on a charge that he committed'
the murder. A fe^ days ago another
Chinese, Ow Sing Duck, was arrested in
Bakerstteld as an accomplice. Deputy
Sheriff Schwick proceeded to Bakersfield
in company with Goo Ah Jim,- who posi
tively identified Ow Sing Duck as the
man wanted here.

SPOKANE, Jan. 27.â This was the cold
est day known In this city In some years,
the Government observer's thermometer
registering 12.5 degrees below, zero this
morning. Reports from the fruit districts
of Eastern Washington show but little
damage to fruit and none seems to be
feared. .
- SAN JOSE, Jan. 27. â This morning was
the coldest of the season, the thermome
ter registering 23 degrees above zero. No
damage has been done, for the fruit buds
have not yet started sufficiently to be
Injured. \ '
i STOCKTON, Jan. 27.â The coldest
weatner of â¢ the season struck Stock
ton last night. The lowest point
reached by. the mercury was 26
degrees above zero. Puddles of water
about town were frozen over, and on the
islands the weather was the coldest ever
known, water pipes freezing everywhere.
Grain and fruit men are pleased, because
the cold gives the grain an opportunity to
stool and keeps ' back the fruit buds so
that late frosts will not hurt them.
I SAN BERNARDINO, Jan. 27.â The min
imum temperature at this point last night
was 30 degrees, as against 24 degrees ear
lier in the season. Light wind and cloudy
weather prevented a killing frost. While
there was considerable ice and frost in
this section, the -damage to oranges was
slight, only low-lying orchards suffering
loss. The , heaviest damage reported Is
between this city and Redlands. :Â¦ .
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 27.â Cold and clear
weather has prevailed here for forty
eight, hours. The mountains fifty miles
to the east are covered by three feet of
snow. The lowest degree of temperature
registered in this city - last night was 39.
Heavy rain, clouds can be seen over the
mountains, and the wind continues from
the south.
â¢LOS ANGELES, Jan. 27.â A heavy bank 1
of clouds that blew up last night mod
erated the cold weather of the preceding
twenty-four hours and averted serious
damage to -fruit-gTowers. The killing
frost predicted for this morning did not
materialize, 40. degrees being the minimum
temperature recorded by the Government
thermometer. The cold weather continues,
but orchardlsts have had ample warning
and probably will not suffer serious loss.

on the . evening . of ; October. ' 11 last, -was
positively,; identified as the assassin by
Witness Arthur Cleve yesterday. The
i scene was a dramatic one and held the at
tention of all In the courtroom
-' Cleve Is a, lad of les than 15 yeaxa. On
the evening of the. murder he left, the
McNicholls elevator j works and boarded
a Howard street car Â«t Main street to go
to his home. Before they reached Twen
tieth street he observed Buckley and Mo
ran standing on the forward steps of the
car. g Moran looked back at intervals, as
if* waiting for some one in the rear to
jump off, -while Buckley held; on with one
hand, "the other being --constantly in his
hip pocket' "When Twentieth, street was
reached Buckley . and Moran sprang off
and etood by. as another man began to
club Rice. Suddenly Buckley drew a re
volver and fired four shots into the body
of the man, then lying on the ground. A
moment later Buckley and Moran dashed
down the street Â¦ toward Shotwell street.
"Do you know who it was that fired the
shots at Rice?" inquired Prosecuting At
torney Alf ord. ' " >.;'

"Who was it?" t *
"William Buckley.". '/ r -v >_-
"la he in this room?" ' V
"Yes. -sir.'' i "â¢-- - N
.'. "Can you point him out?" -
"Yes, sir."
"Put your hand on his shoulder."
Young Cleve arose and stepped outside
the railing to the place where Buckley
sat, with blanched Â¦ face, near his attor
neys. The crowd watched him curiously
I as : Cleve â¢ stepped to Buckley's side and
'lightly placed his hand on the prisoner's
left shoulder. . ... .
i "Is that the man : who shot George
Rice?" , - .- '
: "That is the â¢ man who shot George
P.ice."
: Buckley glared viciously at the retreat
ing form of the young witness as he re
! sumed his seat on the stand. .
!Â¦ The defense then took him In hand and
; he was sharply cross-examined. Cleve
i stoutly repeated his story, -and- he was
little shaken under the - steady fire of.
questions hurled at him. Cleve Identified
1 the light hat worn by Buckley at the time
! of - the arrest, ~ and , while his testimony
varied in some . respects from : that given
. 1 on the preliranary examination it was evl.
'dent that the lad spoke with sincerity.
iHis was the first direct evidence adduced
Â¦during the trial, and it had evident effect
.upon the jury. - .Â¦-. ~ , ,
-Mrs. Henry ; E. Curzon, residing at 2S10
Folsom street but living at 3380 Twentieth
street on the night of the murder, testi
fied . that she heard pistol shots, and
opened her front window and looked out to
see what was the matter. As she did so
she saw two men running under her win
dow toward Shbtwell street. -One of them
wore a light hat, and her. description of
this man tallied with that of Buckley. On
.being shown the clothes worn by Buckley
on the day In question she said that they
resembled those worn by the fleeing man.
" The case went over, until .Thursday, at
which time a : young : woman now on her
way from Mexico will take the stand. She
was a passenger on the car and will Iden
tify Buckley as the man who stood before
her on the steps and who shot Rice-im

irom him. I decline to give the name. of
my, brother-in-law," said Morris. . '
Morris lives .at the Aldine, a rooming
house, at 404 Turk street. Although the
e f s , was burning â¢ In his apartments last
night he did not answer. Morris is said
to be an expert bookkeeper, and as such
had charge of the payment of the couit
fees in all of Rauer's cases.' Owing to the
methods obtaining Jin the; office of the
Justices' clerk the multiplicity of costs
accruing under the collection agency sys
tem .were thereby easily ; dispensed with,
but to whose' benefit the examinations of
the Mayor s expert have not yet deter
mined. - Â¦Â¦â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦-.' Â¦.-.. â¢ .... * ...->.
â¢ .As 1 a. result of the examination ordered
by Mayor Schmitz Into the accounts of
Clerk : Ed [Williams of the Justices^ Court,
Harry F.' Morris, an employe of the Rauer
Collection Company,' admitted yesterday
that, he A was short In his accounts Twith
that., department of the -city government
to the extent of J125.. He made' a Render
of^this. amount! to the Mayor. He told a
story of how he became involved, but, the
Mayor/did not accept his explanations.
", When -Mayor Schmitz suspended Wil
liams - from his position he said . that , he
had more up his sleeve than was appar
ent on _the cuff. Expert : Cyril .Williams
has been exarniriirig these books for a few
days and has discovered a number of.dis
crepancies, In the accounts. Some of these
may> be^ straightened Qut^ater. /; There is
a aispositionto await'ttnal results. The
Alorris case, however, has opened up a new.
line; of Â¦ inquiry, and the methods of col
lection agencies and their dealings; with
the office of the clerk of the I Justices'
Court will be closely scrutinized.
Morris,' Rauer's representative at the .
office of ; the Justices' ' clerk, .voluntarily
went to Mayor Schmitz yesterday and told
him that he wasrindebted tothe. city for
about $125, but how much more he did
nottknow.; He said that a man named
Brown, who was at present in Alaska, i
had given him $125 as a loan. He said he !
had invested that amount- of money inlthe I
wheat pit. The money J was - put '. up on
m . a , r^ lns and'Morris had to make good.
.-' "^ here . was an " easy road to cover up
the doings of things in the office," said i
Morris to Mayor Schmitz. "All I had to I
do was to take the rubber stamps .that i
are used .there, mark the papers 'filed,' I
or executed', or any other way and they |
passed through the regular channels, in
this way, from day. to day, I covered up
my tracks. I do not know just how much
I- got. away with in this manner, ; but I
do- not think It exceeds .the amount-ten
dered you." Â¦Â¦Â¦,. â¢.:â¢â¢.;â¢â¢ â¢ Â¦, .â¢ I â¢ -
