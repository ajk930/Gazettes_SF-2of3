her Majesty, the Queen, the exceptional
circumstances' In which one of the bel
ligerent parties In South "Africa is placed,
which prevents it from communicating di
rectly with the other belligerent, consti
tutes'one reason for the prolongation of
the war, which is still raging without
pause or end, and which causes so much
misery. It- is, in fact, an exceptional cir
cumstance ' that : one of the belligerent
parties is completely shut in and sepa
rated'from the rest of the world and that
the Boer representatives in Europe are de
prived fof all means of communicating:
with the general comandingr their forces.
j "The difficulty thus arises, for the au
thorities who ought to negotiate for tha
Boer, side are divided Into . two sections,
which are deprived of all means of de
liberating together. It is evident that
the Boer delegates _ in Europe can , do
nothing because, they do not know the
state of affairs in South Africa, and that
the Boers in the field are obliged to ab
stain - from taking any step because they
are hot .- cognizant of the state of affairs
In Europe^, Moreover, tHe delegates In
Europe are bound by their letters of cre
dence^ which- were, drawn up in March,
1900, which bind them so strictly to the
independence of 'the 'republics that they
could i.not even be permitted to accept
the re-establlshment of the status quo
ante-bellum if a mode of settling disputes
which might arira were not laid - down
at. the same time. â¢ These 'circumstances
give rise # to a question whether the of
fer of good offices could not be usefully
made .by a .neutral . power, in. order to
render, at' - least possible negotiations
which; otherwise, could not be opened.
For. this reason it would " be Important
to ascertain whether it- would 'be agree
able to the ", Britannic Government to
make.!use of the good offices of a neu
tral pbwejr. 'If such; good offices are con
fined to .the task of placing in communi
cation negotiators to be appointed by the
two; ; parties,; the Holland Government
might- perhaps be considered as indicated
for- the: performance of that task, seeing
that the Boer delegates are in the Neth
erland - territfiry and accredited to that
Government alone. If his Britannic Ma
jesty's Government should agree : to this
.view, the Government of her .Majesty the
Queen .would have to inquire of tha Boer
delegates, whether they are willing to pro-
,"No more pure and beautiful lives can
be imagined . than are. led by 'some actors
and actresses whom I know. Moreover,
among such alone is success possible un
der the Increasing standard of excellence
set by the /public. I am happy to say,
that jpefsons who exact such lives from
'other's and live them themselves are daily
joinlrigthe 'ranks of the. profession, beau
tifying it by their example and uplifting
it by their practice.
V.. "I-thinkVthat ,thls view of actors and
actresses is, gaining ground rapidly and
that it will be only a year or two before
;the stage will be looked upon 'as just. as
high bred and illustrious a profession for
a man, to follow as law or medicine, or
'any mercantile pursuit Is now; while for
a, woman it.- will -be regarued as just as
legitimate as vocal or instrumental con
cert; work.'.' Â¦â.,.' \V Â¦ â¢ .
J "Personally; I will state that I should
ayoid any -part requiring such a costume,
and. if the choice were between adopting
sucli'a^costume and leaving the stage, I
should 'prefer to leave the stage.
"There are so many cases In which no
respectable "motive .Is fulfilled by tho
wearing" of tights that unreflecting per
sons are- apt to ascribe a want of moral
discernment- to all theatrical persons
merely because theaters of a certain class

COLFAX, Feb. :\4.â The citizens and

been completed. It will enter from the
east, near the level of Donner Lake and
emerge on the Yuba. north of Soda
Springs, a distance of five miles and 800
feet. After leaving the giant tunnel the
line was run for abdut three miles down
the Yuba, when, . owing to storms, the
surveyors' corps repaired to Newcastle
The company will run lines from the big
tunnel, irrespective of present towns, to
ascertain if a line can be found not to ex
ceed a 1 per cent grade or a 4 degree
curve. Should the company conclude- to
bore the great tunnel, it would take five
years work and until completed the cut
off line would not be built. Your corre

there will be no abandonment of the main
line to a point east of Colfax, as It now
touches the leading towns and passes

the lower end of the survey began here,
and that the present and the proposed
lines diverge about half-way between thfs
place and Penryn. In this event Loomis
will remain in her present condition. As
citizens of Placer -County, looking at the
question on general^ principles,, the people
of Loomis manifest' considerable antago
nism to the change.'but'the danger is not
yet sufficiently probable to cause definite
public expression. ' ' '
LOOMIS, Feb. 4.â Little alarm has been
felt, in Lownis. regarding the j proposed
change in the Central Pacific Railroad
line. Nothing beyond a mere rumor had
been heard. The article in to-day's Call,
however, excited no little interest and dis
cussion. It is the prevailing opinion
among merchants, fruit men and growers
that no material damagre can be done
Loomis in a commercial way. At the
worstthe town could only be placed in a
position like that of Winters and Vaca
ville, and freight rates could .not be ap
preciably changed. The distance from
Rocklin is so shoTt that should Loomis be
left off the line the distance would be too
slight to affect it otherwise than in de
preciating the value of real estate on the
present site. . \

William F. Cody, who 'afterward became
famous as "Buffalo Bill," rode In one con
tinuous trip 384 miles without stopping,
except for meals or to change horses.
President Lincoln's first message was car-'
ried from the Missouri River to Sacra
mento in seven days and seventeen hour
This is supposed to have been the quickest
trip for so great a distance that has ever
been made on horseback. With such rid
ing the regular time for letters between
San Francisco and New York was reduced
The quickest time ever made between
San Francisco and New York, by the over
land mail over wnat was known as the
Butterfield route was twenty-one days.
The pony express shortened this time to
ten days, according to the excellent nis
tory of Theodore H. Hittell. The railroad
superseded this service. Nearly 500 horses
were kept to do the pony express service.
There were 190 stations and 200 station
keepers and eighty-wonderful riders. Each
rider usually rode three horses, or about
seventy-five miles. .. . .
Here they were met by an enthusiastic
crowd with bands and torches. A proces

Pony Express Riders.
The opening- of the Central Pacific road
to traffic between the East and the Gold
en Gate marked the beginning of a new
period, vhlch had in it as picturesque
features as the p/rst had possessed; But
there had earlier been, exhibited in the
overland â¢ transit daring Â¦ and dash that
make the blood still tingle when the
story is told, for there comes Into -view,
rising and falling as-a fiery horse speeds
across the plains toward the Sierras on the
journey to California, the rider :of the
pony express. He is gaunt, bronzed with
weather to the color of copper,' keen-eyed,
fearless of Indians or wild beasts, so bound
to his steed by the habit -of riding- that
he might well be a centaur. The first
pony mail left Sacramento on the Pacific
side and St. Joseph, Mo.,; to cross the
mountains and plains on April 3, I860. The
mail from' St. Joseph coming west passed
from rider to rider by way of the South
Pass. Salt .Lake, the Humboldt- River and
Carson Valley i to Sacramento, which it
reached on. April 13. The news of its
coming was hailed with great enthusiasm.
The California Legislature was In session
at Sacramento, and both houses adjourned
in honor -of the event and to -give "rider"
and mall welcome. It came in just in
time for the regular afternoon steamboat,
and the horse, rider and mailbag, just as
â¢they had come to Sacramento, took pass
age on the. boat and arrived at the wharf
at San Francisco on the morning of
April 14.
Although the memory of Californians is
apt to linger with fondness upon the an
ticipations that preceded the actual com
pletion of the first transcontinental' railr
road and to dwell upon the thrill* that
came to them when they knew that the
old overland rail, across which so many
thousands had painfully passed in "prairie
schooners," was banded from end to end
with iron and that "the States" were
thereby- brought immeasurably nearer to
them, it is unnecessary to recount the
history of the subsequent doings of the
railroad builders at any great length. , '
There was a mad, frenzied race east
of the. Sierras to meet the Union Pacific,
Â¦which was building westward as fast as
possible. Then there came the junction.
The meeting of the trains, with the spec
tacular driving of a golden spike from
California into a tie -of California laurel
by Senator Stanford has been pictured.
Days of Romance.
Every town on; the-'Central Pacific line
in Placer. County has a history of great
picturesqueiiess. -;i. There human nature
escaped -.the" shackles of conventionality
and the buoyant spirits of the brightest
and- most daring, young men of the land
had free play in a theater which nature
had provided on a gigantic scale. As
early as June, 1S65, the road "had been
completed to Clipper Gap. In the follow
ing September the line was at Colfax. In
1S66 thirty miles of road over the' Sierras'
were completed. In 1867 forty-seven "miles
were added. -Snowsheds, telegraph lines
and puffing construction trains were now
a familiar sight among the Immemorial
lairs of the grizzly bear and the mountain
lion. The last mentioned year saw the
completion of the line to the border of
California, near Verdi. The line has re
mained in its original location over the
snowy heights of the tall : SIerras to . this
day, unchanged, a period of nearly thirty
five years. In that period a new genera
tion of the sturdiest of California moun
taineers has grown up in the Sierras, who
nave bought land, made their homes and
established themselves in business.
Each successive terminus that was
established served to be the distributing
center for, the mines,, wnich then were
the â¢ seen* of the Â¦ feverish activity of
thousandSÂ»of men. 'There -was an enor
mous teaming business : over Â¦ the moun
tains. During the 'period of construction
of the Central pacific, land" before, it was
operating, . a statement - was . made by a
hostile -voice, .which has never been con
troverted, thai in one year the receipts for
freighting over the' Sierras; to V'Vtrginia
City, via Placerville, brought in the great
sum of $13,000,000. This was-; exclusive of
return freights -and r passenger -business.
This statement was used to show that- the
Central Pacific, which" was then- denounced
as the "Dutch -Flat swindle" ty its
enemies, was really only a scheme v to run
a railroad. out to the mines and secure
the profits from freighting. to the miners.

buying necessities. As for the hordes cf
white men who .-were accompaniments to
the construction of the first line to bind
the East and, the West together, they
spent their money freely, with the accus
tcmed liberalty of- all early Californians.
Adjutant General Corbln was questioned
to-day in regard to Major Lee's statement
in Parliament about having been offered
the services of the chief horse expert of
the United States army in securing horses
in this country for South Africa and said
that this was the first that he (Corbln)
had heard of it. What he did know as a
fact was that there had been no corre
spondence on the part of the adjutant
peneral's office with Lee or any one else
to warrant the statement that the United
States had assisted. <the British operation
in South Africa by the shipment of horses
or any other way. Moreover, General
Corbin said, he did not know, what -was
meant by the expression "chief horse ex
pert, there being no such office in the
United States military service. It is sug
gested that Lee referred to one of tho
large army, contractors who supply the
United States cavalry with mounts.
Resolved, By the Senate and the House, that
the Hon. Paul Kruger, President of the South
African rrnubllc. is hereby invited to visit th*
United States, as the guest- of the country at
such time as may suit his convenience, i For
the defrayment of the expenses incurred in his
entertainment while in this country the'sum of
?~.>,OOO, or so much thereof as may be neces
sary, is hereby appropriated out of any money
in the treasury not otherwise appropriated.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.â Representative
Cochran.of Missouri to-day introduced in
the House the following resolution:
An Invitation to Kruger.
In his weekly report to the War Office
Lord Kitchener states that for the week
ended February 1 twenty-nine Boers were
killed, six wounded, 142 taken, prisoners
and forty-eight surrendered.
The Premier has fixed the restoration of
peace in South Africa as the appropriate mo
ment to resign office. If the war is ended
Lord Salisbury will retire at the conclusion of
the present Parliamentary session, but it is his
present intention to retain his post until peace
is accomplished.
It is said the retirement of Lord Salis
bury from office will be coincident with
the end of the South African war. The
St. James Gazette to-day . claims it has
the highest authority for saying:
Salisbury May Retire.
The whole debate * on this question in
the House of Commons â¢â¢ causes wide
spread indignation, which' Is as evident
among the strongest supporters of the
Government as among 9 the' members of
the opposition. The Ministerial press vi
ciously charges the War Office with ab
solute incompetency, if nothing worse,
and demands a searching inquiry, -hint
ing at the Â¦ possibility that the more im
portant departments of the War Office
make no more creditable showing than
the remount department.
The accredited representative of the War
Office,- Colonel- Wardenop, the attache at
Vienna, was given no opportunity of showing
what knowledge he possessed of the resources
of the country. In the same way I, being mili
tary attache at Washington, was not informed
that there was any intention of buying horses
in the United States. I learned from the Amer
ican newspapers that British officers had been
sent to buy horses, but I 'was not informed
who they were, nor was I asked to give them,
such' assistance .as my position Implied I was
competent, to give.: At the time I had the op
portunity, through the good, will- of -a high
official, of getting the services of . the chief
horse, expert of the United States army as ad
viser. I cabled the suggestion to the War
Office, but I received no reply. .
In the House, of Commons last evening
Major Arthur Lee (Conservative, former
ly British attache with the United States
army during the Spanish-American war
and later British military attache at
Washington) said Great Britain had been
offered the services of the. chief horse ex
pert of the United States ', army as - ad
viser in the purchase of American horses
for the British army*. The revelation was
made during a heated debate on the re
mount question, whereupon Lee^.said: "
"It is quite . evident , that negotiations
thus begun might lead' to no result. But
the possibility of the contrary is also not
excluded. In this condition of affairs it
is desirable to endeavor to open . negotia
tions in the hope that they- may be suc
cessful and face a difficulty which exists
for all belligerent parties, of taking, the
first step in. this direction, and it might
be useful that a third party should un
dertake the matter and serve as an inter
mediary. . ; . . _,., GERICKE."

say a fortnight, ' armed r with adequate,'
tun powers, provided for all eventuali
ties and authorizing them to conclude a
treaty of peace which should bind abso-*
lutely both the- Boers in Europe and the
Boers in Africa. â¢
Such a change as contemplated hardly seems
business like. It would certainly bring about
the establishment of. an electric line through
the towns slighted. At the. time of the build
ing of the Central Pacific. Engineer Judah,
who stood at the head of his profession,- ex
amined many suggested routes over the Sierras
and recommended the present one as the mobt
practical.
Mr. Hood, the Â¦ present chief engineer,
was then a boy in the employ of Judah.
W. C.Conroy, ex-Sheriff of Placer Coun
ty, said:
I have not given the matter much thought,
but do not believe that the company intends
cutting out the towns along its- line through
this . county..;;. I: am inclined to, think that
another road may be. built to accommodate the
traffic. Building a double track road would
probably be impracticable by the present route.
The company would build a. new road on an
entirely new survey. Â¦Â¦ â¢'.
I hardly- think it possible that the railroad
company Intends to make all the changes noted
in The Call. The fact that the various towns
en route and the county. as well have contrib
uted-liberally to the support of- the- railroad
is little argument with a big corporation. As
a rule they do not consult the wishes of any
one .but themselves. However the railroad has
made too many costly Improvements along this
line In the matter of depots, tracks, etc., to
make the proposed change in a hurry.' In any
event I do. not think any of the towns from
Auburn down will- be entirely cut out should
% any change be made. As to just where . the
cutting will commence will depend on the lo
cation of the entrance of the proposed tunnel
through the Sierras. Nothing can be done uptil
that is accomplished, and that time is far dis
tant. â¢
General Jo .Hamilton said:
AUBURN, Feb. 4.â The news of the Cen
tral Â¦ Pacific Railroad's projected change
in;. the line of its track through Placer
County, as exclusively given in The Call
to-day, created no little excitement among
citizens here, as the local press had con
tained nothing more than rumors. Placer
County has paid something like $250,000 as
a b'onus to the railroad, and naturally her
citizens feel indignant at what they would
term bad faith. They are loth to believe
that the railroad will make any radical
changes in the immediate future.
The railroad surveyors, presumably the
same corps that operated near Cisco be
fore the storms, have .been in the vicinity
of Newcastle the last ten days. They re
port a gain of eighty, feet in the grade in
a nine-mile survey northeast of Rocklin,
the starting point. Â¦
Samuel J. Pullen of the firm of Pullen &
Wallace when approached said he didn't
see-much to worry over. The projected
change would be too expensive, especially
that portion above Colfax.
- W. A. Shepard, editor of the Placer Her
ald, said: -
port New Line Reduces Grade.

ENGINEERS AT NEWCASTLE.
Captain Cook, who commanded the
Brooklyn, is ill in the naval hospital in
Washington. For the views of the la.te
Rear Admiral Philip, who commanded
the Texas, the President read an article
written by that officer for the Century
Magazine. When the decision is an
nounced Rear Admiral Schley cannot
complain that the President did not give
full consideration to all the facts in the
case.
The decision was reached after the
President had read the evidence taken by
the court of Inquiry, had talked -with
Rear Admiral Schley and had carefuuy
considered his brief, after he had learned
the views of Captain Clark, who com
manded the Oregon; Rear Admiral Â¦ Ev
r ns, who commanded the Iowa; Rear
Admiral Taylor, who commanded the In
diana, and Commander Wainwright, who
commanded the Gloucester, and the an
swer to Rear Admiral Schley's brief pre
pared by Captain Lemly and Hanna,
judge advocate and assistant judge art
vocate of the court of lnquirv. Rear Ad
miral Sampson's counsel, and Captain
Chadwick, who commanded the New
Tork, were not consulted.
President Considers Evidence.
In announcing this decision the Presi
dent will absolutely support the - posi
tion taken by Secretary Long, and will
show the country that notwithstanding
the ovations given to Rear Admiral Schley
by the people of the West and South, \ie
does not propose to flinch from what he
regards as his plain duty. There are
some here who are uncharitable enough
to believe that Rear Admiral Schley un
dertook the trip for the purpose of im
pressing the President -with the general
thought that he is regarded as the hero
of Santiago. From Roosevelt's decision,
it is apparent that the cheering of the
populace for Schley has absolutely no ef-'
feet whatever. \ â¢
President Roosevelt will also generally
approve the unanimous findings of the
court, though he may differ on one or two
minor points.
That by retaining Rear Admiral
Schley as eecond In command after his
arrival at Santiago on June 1, Rear Ad
miral Sampson condoned the "reprehen
sible conduct" of that officer.
That during the chase of the Colon
Rear Admiral Schley was technically in
command of the left wing of the Amer
ican squadron, but hoisted no signal. or
gave any orders which in the -slightest
degree influenced the operation of any
ship save the Brooklyn.
Reprehensible Conduct Condoned.
That both Rear Admiral . Sampson and
Rear Admiral Schley â¢ hoisted signals at
the beginning of tlje 'battle which were
not observed, or if observed -were not
obeyed, as the captains of ships were
.acting in accordance with the plan deter
mined upon before the battle.
That Rear Admiral ' Schley and the
Brooklyn acted in /accordance with the
plan until the Brooklyn made her famous
loop, which left an opening in the block
ade line through which, the Spanish fleet
steamed. Â¦' "...
That the battle was fought in accord
ance with the plan prepared and adopted
by Rear Admiral Sampson. '
That Rear Admiral William T. Samp
son was technically and actually in com
mand of the American forces which de
stroyed the Spanish squadron at Santiago
de Cuba.

Mrs. Whittaker, Â¦ who conducts . the
Repellier lodging-house at .781 Sutter
street, last night Informed the local police
that Mrs. Hammond Moore, who was a
guest at her place, left for the East on
January 18. Mrs. Moore said that she
would stop at Sacramento to visit a
friend, who wasto accompany her to New
York. Mrs. Moore took with her three or
four large trunks, which were filled with
sealskins and the finest of clothing. She
was plentifully supplied with money
The theory is advanced by some of the
former acquaintances of Mrs. Moore that
the Stockton suicide may have been some
friend of- Mrs. Moore, who, knowing of
the latter's departure for the East as
sumed her name to hide her own identity

the care of a friend In San Francisco.
Ward is a theosophlst.
The case was continued two weeks to
enable the plaintiff to procure further
corroborative testimony.
Andrew de March, a hostler, is one of
the persons who are positive that the
body of this woman is now in the Stock
ton Morgue. Lyle Dickey was. a playmate
of his when both were children. He ha3
known her for many years, and he enter
tained her at his home In this city no
longer ago than Christmas. Mrs. de March
visited the Morgue to-day to view the
body of the dead woman. As soon as she
looked upon the features she exclaimed:
"iyr God, it is Lyle!"
B. TS. Johnson, formerly a court reporter
of Sacramento, declares that the dead
woman was known in Sacramento as Mrs.
Aiken. (A former husband of Lyle Dickey
was named Aiken.) Deputy Sheriff Mc-
Cullough says the suicide was one of the
They are still of the opinion that the
name was assumed and that the suicide
was not, as she is alleged to have told
acquaintances, the -widow of a Confeder

STOCKTOX, Feb. 4.â Stockton's police
force is struggling with what appears to
be one of the strangest cases of mistaken
Identity on record. If the result of an In
vestigation conducted to-day by Sacra
mento detectives may be taken as con- 1
elusive. Several citizens have positively
identified the woman who committed sui
cide in. the Imperial Hotel last week as
Lyle Dickey (her maiden name), a daugh
ter of the late Samuel Dickey of Isleton.
They declare that there can be no mis
take, one of the number claiming that
he had known Lyle Dickey for the past
twenty years. In the face of these state
ments Sacramento detectives to-night
wired to the "local officials that the real
Lyle Dickey is. now living in that city.
This apparently disposes of the conten
tion that the suicide was the former Sac
ramento County girl, and the supposed
identification has only added to the mys
tery.

city last week, was In reality Llye Dickey,
formerly of Isleton, this county. As a re
sult of their investigations they have been
forced to the conclusion that there has
been an extraordinary case of mistaken
Identity. They have found that the woman
Â¦who was formerly Lyle Dickey is In this
city, alive and well. She is the wife of
Patrick Scally, a barkeeper.
Mrs. Scally declares she Is the Lyle
Dickey of former days and in corrobora
tion of her statement the detectives have
learned that she was- once the wife of a
man named Southworth- and later mar
ried "a man named Altken. These facts
accord with the statements of the Stock
ton citizens, who believed that the sui
cide was the former Isleton jrfrl. The' lo
cal detectives are positive that the Stock
ton suicide was not Llye Dickey and that
Mrs. Scally's pretentione are genuine.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 4.â All day
long Chief of Police Sullivan and
his detectives have been working
upon advices received from the
SAN JOSE. Feb. 4.â The books at the rail
road office show that the freight business In
and out of this city for the month of January
'was double that of the same rrw^nth last year.
During the month "200 carloads of prunes and
large quantities of other dried fruits . were
shipped to the East.
. The court says that if roaming about in
Idleness Is a crime, then. Indeed, the of
fense is most comprehensive and em
braces not only the tramp but also the
tourist and health seeker, for they, equal

It were, the man who retires from busi

becomes a criminal by reason of such re-
Two San Bernardino Judges Rule
That Certain Subdivision Is .
. Unconstitutional.
SAN BERNARDINO. Feb. 4.â Judges
O*-ter and Bledsoe of the Superior Court
to-day rendered a decision declaring sub
division 3 of section 647 of the Penal Code
unconstitutional. This section defines the
crime of vagrancy and subdivision 3 holds
that a person is guilty of being a va
trant when he roams about from place
to place without any lawful business.
This the court holds is in violation of the
constitution of the United States, as well
es of the State, as It tends to interfere
with the Inalienable rights vested in
every person. . .
The case at bar was the People vs.
"Jim" Goddard. He was sentenced by
Justice Root of Needles to spend ninety
days in the County Jail for vagrancy.
The complaint charged him with violat
ing subdivision 3 of section 647. His at
torney appealed the case to the Superior
Court. Arguments were heard by Judges
Oster and Bledsoe, sitting in bank, and
to-day the decision was rendered, both
Judges concurring In the opinion that the
Eubdlvision was unconstitutional.
Mrs. M. E. Manley of the Courtland
lodging-house was certain the . dead
woman was Mrs. Bennlnger. Mrs. Man
ley, without having seen the articles at
the Morgue described them perfectly.
. "Jack" Grlgsby, a salqpnlst of this city,
who has , known Lyle Dickey for more
than twenty years, went to the Morgue
late to-night. He said the suicide closely
resembled his old-time acquaintance, but
was not she. Mrs. Aiken was in this city,
according to him, for some little time
prior to January 14, when she bade him
good-by, saying she was going to San
Francisco the next day on the morning
train. â¢"
The Coroner produced the cape . from
among the deceased's belongings and
ripped open the brown lining. Sure enough
the blue lining was found under it De
March also correctly described the dead
woman's teeth. '
woman came to this city early last De
cember and registered as Mrs. Benninger
at the Courtland lodging-house on- Main
street. Later she took room 15 at the
White House, on Main street and regis
tered there as Mrs. Adklns. She some
times went by. the. name of Moore. Early
last month Mrs. Bennlnger came. back to
the Courtland House. She seemed to be
greatly worried and cried several times
She confided her troubles to the landlady,
Mrs. M. E. Manley. and said she would
make away with herself if her husband
did not take her back. It was while at the
Courtland House that she met De March
and recognized him as a friend of her
earlier life. He took her to his home at
621 East Washington street, in this city,
where she remained until about three
weeks ago, when she left for San Fran
cisco. De March positively identified .the
dead woman at the Morgue to-day as tne
former Mrs. Bennlnger.
"She had a black sealskin cape with
long hair. It was lined with blue silk and
k on top of that had a lining of brown
material," said he.
Dickey girls, and a mechanic named
Beecher is of the same opinion.
De March says that Lyle Dickey was
married four times, her first three hus
bands being named Southworth,- Aiken
and Bennlnger. He insists that this

U9lW TO BE DEFECTIVE
SXJISUN, Feb. 4.â Mrs. Phoebe Fitchett,
Mrs. Love Lambert and Mrs. Addie Jones
have filed a contest of the will of their
mother, Mrs. Ruth A. Chadbourne, basing
their objections on allegations that' the
will was signed under undue influence and
that the deceased was Incompetent at the
time. They claim also that the -real es
tate deeded by the deceased to her sons
was not separate property, and it Is fur
ther alleged that the will was not com
plete as offered for probate.
There are nine children of the deceased,
among whom the property was divided,
four sons being given valuable farms, one
daughter $10,000, another $3000 and- the
other three $2000 each.

KTRS. CEADBOTTANE'S WILI.
A great deal of testimony was intro
duced showing that the deceased, was a
troublesome neighbor.
There were no Â¦witnesses present at the
time of the shooting. Sheriff Croxon and
the Coroner found a pistol with two empty
shells by the side of the body the follow
ing day. The bullet from tbe old woman's
rifle had passed through the skull of her
half-brother. .
On the day of the homicide Mueller had
an altercation with a eon of Mrs. Xutz
and attempted to strike him with an ax.
After this, according to the testimony of
the defendant, Mueller went to her
cabin. When 6be appeared at the door
and told him to go away, he drew a pistol
and shot at her. She ran in and got a rifle
and again told him to leave. He raised
his arm as though to fire again and she
ehot him dead.
At the time of the killing the Grand
Jury was In session. It investigated the
case and brought in an indictment against
the old lady. This was on December 9
and since that time ehe has been held
without bonds. The trouble that led up
to the tragedy had been of long stand
ing and resulted from a dispute over a
piece of Government property. Mrs. Nut*
forbade Mueller to come on her premises.
Ke paid no attention to this warning, but
insisted on crossing her land and other
wise annoying her.
The trial of the aged prisoner occupied
ten/ days and never was more Interest
displayed In a court case In San Benito
County. It was evident from the time of
her arrest that the sympathy of the com
munity was with Mrs. Nutz and there was
general rejoicing when the verdict giv
ing her freedom was announced. Fifty
witnesses were examined, the gTeater
number being from. Monterey County and
the lower end of this county, the scene
of the homicide.
HOL.LI&TER, Feb. 1â Mrs. Anne Nutz,
a' feeble woman of JO years, was to-night
acquitted by a jury in the Superior Court
of the murder of her half-brother, F. S.
Mueller, last November. When the ver
dict was announced the aged woman arose
and attempted to thank the Jury, but be
fore she could utter a word she fainted,
falling into the arms of her son. She was
carried frdtn the courtroom, broken by
the strain of her imprisonment and trial.
Epedal Dispatch to The Call.
The Trans-Alaska-. Company's expedi
tion, which made the six hundred mile
portage from the Yukon to Ilamnia Bay,
Cook Inlet, encountered only one storm.
Several rivers that It crossed were open,
though usuafly frozen at this season to
a depth of many feet. The entire sum.
mer on the Alaskan coast was mild and
rainy, with a temperature similar to that
of Washington and Oregon.
The masters believe that a tremendous
submarine disturbance occurred during
the fall of 1899, when the entire western
part of Alaska was shaken by earth
quakes. Their theory is that a great sub
marine mountain range j was thrown up
at that time underneath the Japan cut
rent, with the result that the current was
deflected toward the American shore. In
support of, this view they quote the fact
that the western coast of Alaska has been
more foggy during the . past two years
than ever before and that the climate has
been much milder. The change in tem
perature has been quite gradual, the max.
imum having been reached this winter,
â¢when mild, rainy weather has prevailed
throughout Western Alaska, from Nome
to Valdes. Â¦ C
TACOMA, Feb. 4.â Several sea captains
sailing regularly to Alaskan ports say
that beyond doubt the Japan current has
changed its course during the past year
or two and is now sweeping several hun
dred miles nearer the Alaska coast line
than formerly. Captain Wallace of the
steamship Cottage City and Captain John
O'Brien of the Dolphin . are quoted by
Skagway papers^ as holding this view.

' HAD KIDNEY TROUBLE
Thousands Have Kidney Trouble
and Never Suspect It.
Gertrude Warner Scott Cured by the Great
Kidney Remedy, Swamp-Root.
, Vinton, Iowa, July* 15th, 1901-
DR. KILMER & CO., Binghamton, N. T.
Gentlemenâ In the summer of 1833, I was taken violently ill. My trouble be-
gan with pain in my stomach and bacMc, bo severe that it seemed as lf knives
were cutting me. I -was treated by two of the best physicians In the county,
and consulted another. None of them suspected that the cause of my trouble
was kidney disease. They all told me that I had cancer of the stomach, and
would die. I grew so week that I could not walk) any more than a child a
month old, and I only weighed sixty pounds. One day my brother saw in a
paper your advertisement of Swamp-Root, the srreat kidney remedy. He bought
me a bottle at our drug store and I took It. My family could see a change in
me, for the better, so they obtained more and I continued the use of Swamp-
Root regularly. I was so -weak and run down that it took considerable time
to build me up again. I am now well, thanks to Swamp-Root, and weigh 143
pounds, and am keeping house for my husband and brother on a farm. Swamp-
Root cured me after the doctors had failed to do me a particle of good.
(Gertrude Warner Scott.)
"Women suffer untold misery because the nature of their disease is not cor-
rectly understood; in many cases when doctoring they are led to believe that
womb trouble or female weakness of some sort Is responsible for their ills,
when In fact disordered kidneys are the chief cause of their distressing troubles.
The mild and extraordinary effect of the world-famous kidney* and bladder
remedy. Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, Is soon realized. It stands the highest for its
wonderful cures of the most distressing cases. A trial will convince anyoneâ
and you may have a sample bottle sent free, by mail. ,

Attention was called yesterday to the
necessity for proper landmarks to indi
cate the narrow channel at the entrance
to Oakland harbor by . the grounding on
tho north side of the channel of the
steamship Centennial, which was being
towed to Oakland. The local Government
lighthouse . engineers are- now trying i to
yet from Washington an appropriation -for
Centennial Buns Aground.
Four big sailing vessels came over the
bar yesterday afternoon in a fleeu Two
of them, the British ship. Langdale and
the French bark: Jules Verne, were towed
in. The German ship C. H. Watgen and
the British ship Wavertree sailed to their
anchorages. The latter vessel. In charge
of Pilot Miller, sailed to an anchorage
well down the bay, and as she threaded
her way through the mazes of shipping
the pilot's nervy seamanship excited much
admiring comment. The Langdale left
London July 31 and came by way of Hon
olulu, which port she reached in 150 days.
There she discharged all but 800 tons of
her cargo. Captain Hunter is well known
in this port. He served his apprentice
ship under Captain McAllister, the local
6tÂ«vedore and a former master of the
Langdale. Captain Hunter Is accom
panied by his wife, who is a daughter of
Captain Kelly of the old Langdale, who
wag also well known here. Mrs. Hunter !s
one of the principal owners of the Lang
dale. The Langdale sighted tho Horn
October 7, but did not get to westward of
the cape for nearly three weeks later,
owing to the prevalence of heavy west
erly gales. The Langdale's cargo consists
chiefly of liquors and cement.

trip In almost steamer time, and that in
spite of a full share of adverse weather
and fickle winds. This is the best pas
sage since 1896. On October 24 of that
year the British ship Andelana arrived In
this port twenty-four days after leaving
Hongkong. This is the shortest trip of
record. The longest passage from Yoko
hama was made by the German ship
Otto Gllderaeister, which arrived here
Mar'cTi 12," 190<T. She played'' Flying Dutch
man on the Pacific for 117 days. Tho
Jules Verne is commanded by Captain
Cerzard, who is well known in the local
French colony and who is very proud of
his vessel's good showing.

was arrested yesterday by United States
Marshal Shine on an indictment found by.
the United States Grand Jury charging
him with defrauding the. Government by
sending in a false return of his business
as Postmaster of Elk Grove. It is alleged
that in October, 1900, Hasman reported
the canceled stamps, etc.,' as of the value
of $194 93, when, in truth, such face value
was only $176 05, a. discrepancy of $18 88.
Hasman gave bonds in $1000' before a Jus
tice of the Peace , at Elk Grove and was
released.

of them broke, oft! a piece with his pick

Seldom has a long: shot been more stead
ily played than was Evander, winner of
the fifth race. Backed at 12 and 15 to 1,
nearly all of the books were hit. Bullman
got the outsider away in front and, never
headed, downed the favorite. Maraschino,'
half a length. Chandoo from, all accounts
was expected to be a contender, but
Woods let him fall out of it, finishing far
back in the ruck. He Is a starter again
to-day. . â¢ , .
Old Joe Ripley, at odds of 10 to 1, nosed
out Dunblane for the final mile and fifty
yard run. The latter picked up a bit in
his speed, cutting out the pace and only
losing on the last stride. Formero, equal
favorite with Bathos; was. left, and the
latter never cut any figure.
Winnie O'Connor on Dotterel, a filly by
Governor Foraker, from the Stevens sta
ble, furnished the upset in the "baby"
event. The young miss jumped away in
front and was never headed, beating MI
Reina a half-length. Imp. Puss in Boots,
the .favorite, was outfooted, .taking the
show. . . ; â¢ ' ' .
i Four to five previous time out the books
laid 10 to 1 against Jingler in the, betting,
on the Futurity course sprint. . The three
year-old â¢ led most of - the way. The
Weaver, a short priced one, was always
the contender, losing by a head only. Hip-'
pomax, a heavily played outsider, came
from the rear, taking the show. Canderos,
tlie favorite, piloted by .Burns, did not
fancy the going and tried to run out
around the far turn. .
. For the introductory slx-f urlong sprint
the Schorr colt, John Peters, went to the
post a 3 to 5 favorite. It loÂ»ked a two
horse race and Wyoming accomplished the
feat. The favorite, after leading, to within
a few yards of the wire, began- stopping
and the old war- horse won-by a head.
Arlgato finished third. Bullman, on the
winner, rode an excellent race.
Right from the start the sport waa
marked by upsets, Kenllworth being the
only favorite ' to land.' Jingler, Evander

Whitney Horses Are Coughing. â¢
LONDON, Feb. 4.âTruth says that
Nasturtium, William C. Whitney's Derby
candidate, has been coughing for the past
ten days and that It is understood other
Heathhouse horses are slmllary affected.
"When once this sort of thing starts,"
says Truth, "there is no telling where it
will end, but it is hoped it will not run
through a.stable which now contains so
many high-class animals."
The Cuckoo has taken first prize for the
most beautifully decorated houseboat in
all the celebrations held at Belvedere. It
.was sold because the business of Its own

It la the intention of the new owners to
remove the ark to Fetaluma Creek, where
they can enjoy the excellent striped bass
fishing which its waters afford. With the
ark goes a swift gasoline launch and a
number of rowboats. The ark has six
roomy sleeping apartments and a large
dining or living room, . the sides of which
are fitted with Persian couches. , , It is
provided with a big kitchen, with a com
plete outfit of cooking utensils.- -Â¦-Â¦
. Negotiations were completed yesterday
whereby the ark passes into the posses
sion of a club of.. ten sportsmen.. It will
be ..known as the Quo Vadla Club, and is
made up of the following: Will S. Kittle,
John B. Coleman,. A. M. Cumming, F. T.
Hayes, A. B. Harrison, Henry Landsber
ger, George W. Emmons, W. F. Bogart,
E." Painter and F. H. Bushnell.
For seven years the popular owner of
the Cuckoo has dispensed the most lavish
hospitality on the boat, on which he has
livfed during the summer months over

Quickly Restores Lost Vigor
to Men.
AFree Trial Package Sent by Mali
to All Who Write.
Free trial packages of a most remark-
able remedy are being mailed to all who

suffering of lost manhood that the Insti-
tute has decided to. distribute free trial
packages to all who write. It is a home
treatment, and all men who suffer from
any form of sexual weakness resulting
Croat youthful folly, premature loss of
strength and memory, weak back, varico-
cele or emaciation of parts can now cure
themselves at home. . . , I
The remedy has a peculiarly, grateful i
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, .giving strength
and development Just where it is needed.
It cures all the ills and troubles that come
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute success in
all cases. A request to the State Medical
Institute, 228 Elektron building. Fort
Wayne, Ind., stating that you desire one
of their free trial packages, will be com-
plied with promptly. The Institute is de-
birous of -reaching that great class of men

sexual weakness when the proper reme-
dies are employed. The Institute makes
no restrictions. Any man who writes will
be sent a free sample, carefully sealed In

have no ~fear of embarrassment or pub-
licity.. Readers are requested to write

Mrs. "W. TV. Stone, wife of Professor
Stone, principal of the James Lick Gram
mar School, passed away last evening at
6:30 at her apartments at the Van Nuys
Hotel, 1001 Bush street. JMrs. Stone died
of burns received on Tuesday afternoon,
January 28. '
She was unconscious at the last, and
Dr. C. F. Pawlicki Jr., who attended the
unfortunate woman, says she succumbed
to a- series of complications arising from
her terrible injuries.
Mrs. Stone was drying her hair over a
gas heater in her rooms when suddenly
her tresses took fire, the flames being
quickly transmitted to her clothing. She
threw herself upon the floor, causing the
curtairuJ and draperies of the room to
ignite. It was due to the .timely arrival
and presence of mind of J. S. Starr, pro
prietor of the hotel, who heard her
screams, that death did not immediately
ensue. He succeeded in extinguishing the
flames, but not until Mrs. Stone's head
and the upper/ portion of her body had
been terribly blistered and seared.
Though in the midst of great suffering,
Mrs. Stone managed to explain that she
was in the act of drying her hair over
the gas stove when it caught fire.
Mr. Stone and his daughter, Mrs. N. P.
Cole Jr., of 1716 Pacific avenue, were at
the bedside. Miss Jessie E. Stone of Los
Angeles, another daughter, is lying crit
ically ill at Los Angeles and was unable
to come to the city. It is feared that the
shock resulting from the sad news of her
mother'n death may prove too great for
her to survive. <

Important examples of the work of a

are from the brush of Jules Pages and
both have been honored with medals by
the authorities of the Paris Salon..
The more ambitious effort. "La Toilette
du Modele," is a study of the nude, almost
life size, and representing a female model
dressing. The study shows the artist at
his test and is a powerful and interesting
effort. The canvas is perhaps too crowd
ed, the detail in some degree detracting:
from the central figure, and, like all of
Pages' work, the subject Is handled In
more literal /than . Imaginative fashion.
But as an example, of flesh painting It la
of the cleverest and strongest work that
has been seen here. The figure Is grac
lully posed, the woman, half -kneeling,
half-standing, facing a mirror, and tossing
up ner hair with easy gesture. The flesh
Is admirably modeled and the drawing is
delightfully sure and free throughout.
The figure compares most favorably with
the specimen of Pages' work now tn^the
Mark Hopkins Art Gallery that deals
with a somewhat similar subject.
The other picture Is also a figure sur>
Ject, .titled "La Gltanella." and represents
a Spanish dancer. . This also is a medal
picture, but the reason for the distinction
is not so Immediately apparent. It is a
pleasant color harmony, but the figure
lacks life and roundness and the present
ment of the subject Is not of the most pic
turesque. "La Gitanella" was painted by
Pages on a recent visit to Madrid. But it
is pleasant food for reflection that a Cali
fornian is winning such honorable place
in the great world of art as Pages is win
ning for himself In Paris.

A daring daylight robbery was commit
ted on Clay street, just west of Mont
gomery, yesterday afternoon, but the rob
ber was speedily captured by Policemen
Steve Bunner and P. Herllhy.
V. Petrovich, a visitor from the coun
try, who is stopping at the Garibaldi Ho
tel, 222 Broadway, had just turned into
Clay street from Montgomery when a
man thrust him into a doorway, garrotted
him and snatched his silver watch, break
ing the chain. It was all done so quickly
that Petrovich had not time to call for
help. .
Policemen Bunner and Herllhy had been
standing" on the corner of Clay and
Kearny streets and Bunner started to
walk toward Montgomery, when* Alfred
Kadich of 11 Fifth street came running
toward him and said, pointing to a man
walking hurriedly along the sidewalk,
"That man has robbeci another man."
Bunner, tbok hold of the man pointed out,
who claimed in broken English, Â»"I've
done nothing." Just then Petrovich came
running up with a piece of chain hanging
from a buttonhole in his vest and said he
had been robbed of his watch by the pris
oner. Bunner | searched the prisoner and
found the stolen watch and piece of chain
In his pocket. - .

Men In every walk of life honored the
memory of the late Lawrence J. Dwyer,
Supervisor of the city and county, by at
tending his funeral yesterday. Officials
of the municipal government and ( rela
tives and' friends of deceased crowded St.
Peter's Church on Alabama street, near
Twenty-fourth, and devoutly heard the
solemn requiem high mass celebrated for
the repose of his soul. The ceremony was
of the most impressive character, and
tears were shed in sympathy for the
widow and children, for many hearts
were sad at the loss of a departed friend.
Rev. Father* Casey, pastor of the
parish, was celebrant. He intoned tho
offices of the mass with feeling. The bier
was placed in the center aisle Immediately
before the altar, and many floral tributes
from dear friends reposed on the lid of
the coffin.
Throughout the mass the choir rendered
music appropriate to the occasion. Miss
Annie I. Roney sang "Nearer, My God, to
Thee" with depth and feeling, moving tho
mourners to tears.
Re.v. Peter C. Torke preached the
eulogy of the dead. It was a tribute to a
life well spent. It was not an address oi
praise, but a eulogy befitting the charac
ter of the decease^. He told of Lawrence
J. Dwyer's life of honest purpose and of
his devotion as a husband and father.
. "What his work for this city was," the
speaker said, "you all know, and there
fore he needs no encomiums from my lips.
His deeds speak for him. All pay tribute
to his earnestness of character, and above
all to his honesty as a man. From his
youth he was more or less interested in.
public affairs, and that he has go le
through that ordeal, through all Us
temptations, without a slur on his char
acter proves that he was an honest man.
and this I say la his eulogy. For honesty
is greater than any . worldly emolument
ana more powerful than wealth."
In conclusion Father Ttorke told of
Dwyer's interest in church work and how
he helped to upbuild St. Peter's parish by
advice and deeds. v_; . ;
The vast congregation then filed out of
the sacred edifice- and stood with bowed
heads, forming a lane to. the hearse.

JOHX C. STELZXEB, one of the
most popular officers connected
with the North End station, and
Miss Marie Louise Reeves, a
daughter of the late Sergeant of
Police Jarces Reaves, were joined in wed
lock last night at St. Mary's Cathedral.
The Rev. Father Prendergast performed
the ceremonies, Â¦ which were, pretty and
simple, and were â¢witnessed by many
friends of the happy young couple.
John Ford, a molder's apprentice, testi
fied that* he saw the murder and that
Buckley was not the murderer. ! On cross
examination he became tangled up in his
answers, and stated that while he saw
J. B. Rolver, a teamster, testified that
he saw the shooting and that he w.as posi
tive that Buckley was not the man who
had used the pistol. On cross-examination
he stated that he was about 450 feet from
the scene of the shooting, and that he had
to. look around to see what was going on
He admitted that though he was in a
wagon he did not whip up his horses to
follow the man who did the shooting
Charles Klnnear, a millwright, testified
that he saw the murder of Rice and that
Buckley was not the man who fired the
fatal shots. Klnnear Contradicted the
other witnesses for the defense by testi
fying that the man who did the shootine
was alone at the -time, i Â¦
Witnesses Contradict Each Other.
On cross-examination Oppenheimer ad
mitted that he had been interviewed by a
machinist a number of times since the
murder, but that he did not know the
man's name. He had been taken by this
man to see Buckley at the Jail and also
to the. office of Buckley's attorneys. The
cross-examination . was carried out on
lines to show that the witness could not
have seen the shots fired and that it was
impossible for him to have reached the
door of his house in the time that elapsed
between the first shot and the last one
"He was about the same size and build,"
replied the witness.
Samuel Oppenheimer, a cigarmaker, who
resided at the corner of Howard and
Twentieth streets on the night of the
murder, testified that he was on the sec
ond floor of his house when he saw a car
stop, but not at the regular place. Oppen
heimer claimed that he ran. down stairs
when he heard a shot fired and that he
saw a man firing at another who was ly
ing on the ground- He was positive that
the man who fired the shots wore a dark
hat and was taller and heavier than
Buckley. â¢ .
"How did the man who did the shooting
compare with the defendant, Buckley?"
asked Special Counsel Dunne.
Stewart also contradicted the evidence
of Miss Edmondson by stating that the
man who fired the- shots at Rice stood
within from three to five feet of his vic
tim, and that anther man stood close to
the elbow of the murderer.
On cross-examination Stewart testified
that he might be mistaken as to the color
of the hat worn by the man who fired the
shots, but his impression was that it was
a dark soft hat.
He Slight Be Mistaken.
The principal point sought by the de
fense in placing Stewart on the witness
stand was to get his statement that he
believed that the man who did the shoot
ing had a dark hat on. Buckley wore a
light hat when he was arrested.
Thomas H. Stewart, a mail carrier, tes
tified that Rice was lying on the ground
at Howard and Twentieth streets when
two men, ran up to him and one of them
fired four shots into his body. Both men
then ran off.
.Peter Bernard Flaherty, 14 years of age,
testified that he was on the car on which
Rice rode out Howard street on the night
of the murder. Flaherty stated that he
saw a man get off the front of the car
and he heard shots fired. He could not,
however, Identify the man who did the
shooting. i
On cross-examination Flaherty flatly
contradicted Miss Edmondson by stating
that the shots that killed Rice were fired
rapidly, and that he saw no man firing
from the curbstone in front of the bak
ery.
"It was fully five minutes," said the
witness, "from the time the first shot was
fired until the man with the pistol started
to run away."
In cross-examination Miss Edmondson
stated that the shots were fired very
slowly and that the man who did the
shooting stood on the curb in front of the
bakery and fired at Rice's body at a dis
tance of fifteen teet.
Took Five Minutes to Fire Shots.
- Miss Florence Edmondson , was the first
witness called for the defense. She testi
fied that she was in a bakery on the cor
ner of Howard and Twentieth streets on
the evening of October 11, when Kice was
shot. She ' heard shots fired while she
was standing at the counter of the store
and looked out of the door.
"I saw a man firing at another, man on
the ground," said the witness, "and then
he put the pistol in his pocket and ran
down Twentieth street to Shotwell. The
man who did the shooting was in front
of .the : bakery, but I did not see his face.
1 did not see Rice clubbed. The man who
did the shooting had a black suit and a
hard hat on. It was a dark hat. I saw
a man with a white hat on. He stood
some distance away f?om the man with
the pistol, but did nothing."
When one. of th*e attorneys for Buck
ley made the opening statement for tne
defense and criticized the evidence of the
witnesses for the prosecution Judge Law
lor' was asked by the prosecution to re
prove counsel. Judge. Lawlor instructed
the attorney- on what lines the opening
statement to the jury should be conduct
ed- and to reserve criticisms of the evi
dence until the final arguments were
made.

The prosecution ciosea its case at this
point and the defense asked permission
to recall some of tne witnesses tor tne
purpose of cross-examination.
Louis K. Levy, iiaward" U. Leahy and
Frank J. Keveney, eye-witnesses to the
murder, testified that they saw two men
running away after Kice was shot. Tney
did not see tne men pass any weapons to
each other.

fense, and JuQge Lawior repeatedly re

In the opening' address made by one of

peculiarity is that every alternate child
in point of age, has the extra finger and
those who are not six-fingered are blessed
with an extra toe. and those who have six
toes have webs between their toes The
extra fingers and toes have well-developed
nails. Ex.ictly the same conditions nriÂ»

OUT of the discussion which has followed in
Great Britain upon the announcement that
Mr. Carnegie. has determined to supply his
castle at Skibo with a library at a cost of $50,000
there has come a good deal of information concern
ing what a rich man's library should be according to
British standards.
The Westminster Gazette, which has developed the
subject by interviews with leading book dealers, re
ports that a considerable number of them discredit
the statement that the cost of the library is fixed at
the sum named. It is assumed by them that Mr.
Carnegie means to allow that sum for the acquisi
tion of books, but that it does not include the cost
of binding them. Furthermore, it appears that in the
judgment of the experts the binding is a matter of
much more importance and of much more cost than
the books themselves. ,
One expert said that the entire $50,000 could be
easily used up for binding alone, and even at. that
it would not furnish Mr. Carnegie with either a very
big library or a very handsome one. When asked
if a library could be choicely bound for $25,000, he
answered: "Undoubtedly, but its size would neces
sarily have to be limited." He cited a distinguished
lady of London society who has spent more than
$250,000 upon the binding of her library, and went
on to say: "To-day in the. auction marts of Europe
books realize enormous prices on account of their
binding. Volumes by no means rare or unique in
themselves if offered, for sale with a binding, of
Grolier or Ganevari will excite the fiercest compe
tition among wealthy collectors. A copy of La
Fontaine's 'Contes et Nouvelles en Vers,' bound by
Derome for Mme. de Pompadour, realized 17,000
francs. The purchaser paid at. least 16,000 francs' for
the binding." .

With a well supported merchant marine the people
of the United States would profit immensely by the
construction of the isthmian canal, and the commer
cial competitors of this country are well aware of it.
Thus it happens that the opposition to the canal and
to the shipping bill includes almost every foreign
influence that can make itself felt at Washington.
Foreign ship-owners, merchants, manufacturers,
bankers and ship agents in American ports are all
hostile to anything calculated to extend and to
strengthen our growing supremacy on the world's
markets. We need not find fault with them for
making their opposition felt in every way they can.
It is their right to take care of their own. Our duty
is to take care of our own.
The importance of this link to the chain of com
inercial expansion is too plain to be overlooked by
any one who gives it anything like due consideration.
Without an adequate merchant marine it will be
hardly worth while to establish and maintain a De
partment of Commerce, nor would the isthmian canal
avail us much if we had no ships to make use of it.
At present upward of 92 per cent of our exports and
imports are carried by subsidized foreign steamship
lines. We canndt compete with foreign ships which
are more cheaply constructed than our own by work
men at low wages and are manned and officered for
much smaller wages and salaries than are paid on
.\merican vessels.
In his argument to Congress on this subject Mr.
Seabury says the enactment of a well devised ship
ping bill will insure orders and work for American
ship-builders for years to come, will give employment
to thousands of wage-earners, will create an exten
sive industry for the investment of capital, will make
our commerce independent in time of peace, will
provide ample transports in time of war, will give to
our industries rapid communication with all the ports
of the world, and will assure to the American people
over $200,000,000 annually, which is now paid out to
foreign ship-owners for transporting our exports
and imports.
Of these three so-called links the first and last
are imperative. The establishment of a Department
of Commerce is by no means so necessary as the
other two, and yet it seems likely Congress will pro
vide for it much sooner than for either of the others.
Against legislation in favor" of the isthmian canal*
and for the promotion of the American merchant
marine strong opposition is arrayed. That opposi
tion has always been able in the past to defeat the
two measures either directly or by indirection. The
opposition to the merchant marine bill is especially
notable, for, notwithstanding the fact that the Repub
lican party in its national platforms has repeatedly
declared in favor of :i liberal shipping policy, nothing
has yet been accomplished to put such a policy into
operation.
GEORGE J. SEABURY of New York re
cently addressed to Congress an earnest plea
for the enactment of legislation which would
supply what he called "three missing links" in the
chain of our commercial prosperity. The first of
these is an American built and owned merchant
marine, the second the establishment of a Department
of Commerce and Industries, and the third the con
struction of an isthmian canal affording the shortest
route to the Orient.

Such are the facts, which Mr. Hines himself does
not deny. Some method must be devised for pro
tecting the industries of the country from such evils,
and no better plan is at present in sight than that of
strengthening the power of the commission and hold
ing it responsible for the enforcement of the law. . . " "
Unfair and illegal railway discrimination is v one
of the greatest evils that now afflict .the industries
and the commerce of the people. By means of such
violations of the law monopolies are built up, indus
tries are injured, and in some cases whole communi
ties are made to suffer by reason of unfair advan
tages given by the railways to competing points.
Finally, the commission directs attention to the
fact that even where the. courts have sustained the law
the railways continue to violate it, paying no v more
attention to the courts than to the commission. Thus
the report says: "We simply call attention to the
fact that the decisions of the United States Supreme
Court have produced no practical effect upon the
railway operations of the country." V
The assertion of Mr. Hines that the courts, have
not made a single decision which "has impaired the
commission's power to prevent rate cutting" is met
by the statement in the report: "While it was un
doubtedly the intent of the tenth section of the act
to impose a penalty upon the corporation itself, un
der its peculiar phraseology it has, however, been
judicially determined that -the corporation is not
liable. The agent alor.e.can be punished." In another
place it says: "The tenth section as construed by the
courts does not punish otherwise than by a possibly
nominal fine a departure from the published tariff
unless there is actual discrimination - between
shippers.". The report then goes on to say it is not
practical to prove such discrimination because, in
addition to" showing that rebates have been granted
in .violation of law, it would' also be necessary to
show that similar rebates were not granted to other
shippers at the same time on the same class of freight
and under similar conditions.
The response to those charges can be found in the
report recently submitted to Congress by the com
mission. Mr. Hines says the commission has the
right to call for books and documents of the roads,
but the report charges that the railway officials
"destroy vouchers and so manipulate bookkeeping
as to obliterate evidence of the transactions." In
another place, in referring to specific instances of the
violation of the law, the report says: "On some of
the lines the vouchers and other evidences of these
illegal rates were destroyed soon after .the transac
tions-were completed."
Mr. Hines says: "The paramount purpose of the
law was to secure publicity and the maintenance of
tariff rates. It is the express duty of the commission
to keep advised and enforce the law. It has the
widest possible . powers of investigation, including
the right to call for the production of all books,
documents and papers, and it can require the District
Attorneys of thfe United States to prosecttfe all vio
lators. These powers have been upheld by the
courts. The commission, however, has not only
failed to devote its time and energy to discovering
and prosecuting violations of the law, but it has by
its supincness* acquiesced in and encouraged them
and has done all in its power to break down the force
of the act and make it a dead letter by constantly pro
claiming that the courts have made its enforcement
impossible, whereas not a single decision has im
paired the commission's power to prevent rate cut
ting." ,
The claim of Mr. Hines that/his allegation is "in
disputable" is invalid on. its face, because it carries
with.it the admission that the commission disputes
it. There is raised an issue of fact between the con
tending parties, and the country will have to decide
between them. It is to be noted, however, in the
first place that there is no dispute as to the practice
of violating the law. Mr. Hines concedes that the
violation takes place, and his only defense- is that
railways are to be held guiltless because the com
mission does not do its duty. . '
WALKER H.; HINES, first vice president of
the Louisville and Nashville Railway Com
pany, has issued a reply to the request of the
Interstate Commerce Commission for a grant of
larger. powers to enforce the laws .enacted to 7 regulate
railway rates. Referring to the report 5 of the com
mission concerning the practice of the roads in
making rebates to favored parties and making other
unfair discriminations in rates *Mr. Hines says:
"The indisputable fact must be kept before the pub
lic that the prevalence of rate-cutting is an unanswer
able argument against giving the commission more
power, because it is due principally to the commis
sion's utter failure to perform its manifest duty."

Very dainty and appetizing refreshments

Finally, let it be decided as the fact that Congress
seems to drift because the people are drifting. Thd
people started out in the belief that taking the islands
meant the acquisition of more territory upon which
American labor and enterprise would be exploited,
a new land to be settled by our race where it would
perpetuate itself. The recoil from this unfounded
anticipation is taking place. The cry of the Ameri
can Chamber of Commerce at Manila for removal of
all restriction upon Chinese immigration, upon the
plea that only Chinese coolies can work in that
tropical climate, is the raising of the first curtain to
reveal a fact. When the people cease to drift Con
gress will find its compass and rudder.
While tactics are under discussion was it tactical
for the American Superintendent of the Philippine
schools to order all the schools to celebrate Rizal's
birthday and read his appeals to his people for na
tional independence?
One not accustomed to American ways would nat
urally suppose that this means permanent aimlessness
and opportunism in Congress, and that men go to
sleep on the question, waking up only to pay the cost
of an army in the islands, get their change back, and
slumber again. One thread runs i through all the dis
cord of sound and opinion. This is the constant accu
sation that reference to Philippine independence spurs
the islanders to resist our rule and our arms. Sena
tor Hoar's resolution for an investigation of condi
tions there has been stigmatized as encouragement of
disloyalty and resistance. But it appears that other
things said in Congress and in- the country have ex
actly the same effect charged to Senator Hoar's reso
lution. Whenever it is advised that we hold on to
the islands because of their potential wealth, and for
what we can make out of them, it is evident that the
most intelligent Filipinos share with the least intel
ligent an aversion to being treated as an orange, to
be squeezed for its juice. The proposition to hold
them in the colonial relation, import Chinese to pro
duce a commercial surplus, and use the land and the
people as a means of material advantage to us, as
their conquerors, is what rouses that spirit raised in
them by Dr. Rizal, the patriot and martyr. An Ameri
can must concede the kinship of that spirit with our
own aspirations and. their realization wrought out in
our scheme of self-government.
The people hunt the text of the debate in vain for
any statesmanlike enlightenment upon the subject.
The net impression gained is that leaders like Lodge
and Depew and many others on that side are fearful
of their first expressions and impressions, when they
declared themselves opposed to taking and holding
any island or extracontinental territory, and the
Southern members prefer to criticize methods rather
than policies, because of the expansion sentiment in
the South. No issue is made on the main question
at all, and policy drifts.
Reading it one is compelled to admit that it does
not raise the . statesmanship of the Senate in public
estimation. Tillman has flung at Lodge and
Spooner,' accusing them of supporting in. the islands
a concentration policy worse than Weyler's, and they
have retorted that Tillman's people down South burn
negroes at the stake, and he has countered by. citing
the cremation of negroes in Kansas and Colorado.
Senator Dubois has boiled with indignation because
army officers criticize the opinions of Senators and
citizens, and upon that subject attacked General
Wheaton, making the tactical mistake of describing
Wheaton as "a charity boy sent to West' Point by
some Congressman." In the next day's debate the
other side rose all along the line armed with the
army register and flung it into the teeth of Dubois,
for it proved that Wheaton was riot a West Pointer,
but had entered the army from civil life, as a private,
like Miles, Shafter and most of the general officers
of recent prominence. It did not occur 1 - to Dubois
to say anything, and' the discussion went off pn the
Manila censorship of the press, and a cross fire be
tween Hoar and Money about the number of troops
furnished by Massachusetts and the _ South in our
Revolutionary War! Then Tillman broke out in a
pustular way to present the figures relating to the
slaughter of Filipinos by Spain in three centuries
and by us in three years, and so on, the jangle jarred
day after day. '. /
THE appearance of the Philippine tariff bill in
'the Senate has been the signal for a prolonged
and acrimonious debate, which has not been ad
dressed to the provisions of, the bill at al^ but has
ranged, wildly and at will, all over the subject of our
relations to the islands and the islanders.
THE PHILIPPINE DEBATE.
TOWNE-WORDEN RECEPTION DAY
IS ENJOYED BY MANY FRIENDS
among the rich people of London to have books
bound at' a cost of $500 each. The volume presented
to- Victoria by the actors of Great" Britain ! at her
jubilee cost $1750, which was chiefly, expended on
the binding. Â¦.- â¢ ' . " \
.The demand for fine and durable, bindings has of
course stimulated the higher class of binders to make
their trade a genuine fine art. They have not, how
ever, succeeded in surpassing their predecessors of
the first period of printing, and the only explanation
giy^n for the failure is that of an expert who said:
"It is urged that modern binders - display a lack of
originality in design and are but mere imitators of
the old masters, but that observation is true oi- most
decorative' arts. The passion for reproducing old
designs, in my opinion, is not due to lack of inven
tion or individuality on the part of the artist, but
rather to the condition under which he works."

To you who are here it is unnecessary to re
count her victories in the sweeter lines of life.
In literature and In - art, nor her triumphs in
the practical professions of medicine, of law
It was different once. When women were
the slaves of men, their beasta of burden, their
toilers without" hope or faith or light, not much
could be. expected of them whom they served.
They were not fitted, lor the duties of life, they
could not assume its responsibilities. It would
have been a crime against; their dependent ex
istence, and a crime against society and social
evolution, against the future of the race, to
have given them participation in the affairs
of men, in the government of their people, in
the establishment of a civilization. They were
merely the Instrumentalities of man's progress,
a . lower order in the kingdom of animal life.
But as the race developed and woman by her
love and faith and- her immortal aspiration
gradually gained the . respect and the esteem
of the sterner sex, as the home became the cen
ter of attraction, and* the family the center of
social existence, as the schoolhouse arose 'and
education , became diffused . among men and
women, as science and 'arts expanded and-es
tablished and controlled the elemental forces
and made men's burdens lighter, woman was
accorded a little leisure and an opportunity for
obtaining mental equipment; and the progress
of civilization and of literature and of social
development is marked by the advancement of
the standing of woman In the view of man.
We glory in her advance, not alone because of
theoretical admiration, but because she has
raised the rest of mankind with her. ' â¢
Evolutions in Conditions.
I am sure that the State and the nation can
safely confide to its women the working out
of this problem. To those who are Intrusted
the care, nurture and education of its children,
to those whb ' have ever been called upon to
support and sustain its men, the country may
surely leave the eventual disposition of these
questions. - . â¢ .
There is In my mind no more reason why an
intelligent American citizen of education and
refinement, woman though she be, should not
have in the affairs of our civilization, govern
mental and commercial, as well as social, at
least an equal right with the ignorant and the
debased of the opposite sex. I am not. com
mitted absolutely to the doctrine of woman's
suffrage and her equal political rights, not be
cause of any fear that she will not prove equal
to the responsibility but because I have not
given to the question consideration sufficient
to enable me to ' determine definitely whether
or not> are true the only arguments on this
subject which have ever appealed to the consid
erate man of the I world, namely, the selfish
suggestions that the busy activities of political
life will detract from our home life its main
attractiveness- and beauty â will remove the
sentimental ism of our- existence â and, placing
man and woman on the same political basis in
the rivalry of life, will lower the spiritualism
of woman to the materialism of man rather
than elevate the tendencies and inclinations of
man to the present plane occupied by the gen
tler sex.. Of course, there are men whose con
stant contact with the world and with the
rougher edees of society have not dulled their
sentiment or deadened their spirits, and, of
course, there will always be women of similar
type and character, but the general question is
one of evolution and. of progress rather than of
immediate and spontaneous solution, and its de
velopment may well be left to such hands and
heaits and heads as are now before us.
you boldly and with open arms in the name of
the people of San Francisco, and amid the good
wishes of the intelligent citizenship of the en
tire State of California.
I tender you the keys and freedom of the
city, this city eo emblematic of liberty and
equality, which breathes the cosmopolitan spirit
of equal rights to all and special privileges to
none. Beyond this naught is left to offer you,
for our hearts and good will are already yours
and no longer ours to give.
As Mayor of this great city, queen of the
Western world, I welcome you. I greet you
not only as the chief executive of her people,
but also as an individual strongly Interested in
the development of the equality of the sexes
in their legal rights.
I welcome you not only as the women of our
day, our mothers, our wives and our sisters,
but also as tie representatives of the future
of our race, when men and women shall be
considered of absolutely equal standing before
the law, and shall be judged only by their
equal merits and their equal achievements.
I am of those who have not only love but
faith, â¢ not only hope but certainty, in the event
ual recognition of woman's equality in every
walk and sphere of practical life, and, with
the majority of thinking and thoughtful men, I
see in the horizon of the East the dawn of the
day when the burdens and the pleasures of Jife
shall be equally shared, and- the- duties and
responsibiltleB, the privileges and the liberties
of human existence shall be divided fairly and
Justly between the sexes, as their property
rights, their education, intelligence and social
standard may warrant. '
This convention of the Women's Clubs of
California is the rosy fingered child of the
morn, whose radiant light shall shed a luster
over the doings of the men and women of our
State to the betteVment of both, and to the
elevation to an equal plane of those who by
arrogatlon of right , and by custom . we have
been prone to consider the weaker sex.

' We meet to-day for the first time as a thor
oughly organized body. When we met in Los
Angeles two years ago and It was my privilege
to extend the word of /welcome wo were for
the most part a company, of strangers. What
I prophesied then has come true. We have
looked straight into one another's faces, and
through the eyes down Into the mind and soul,
until reading there honesty of purpose, can
dor of difference and unity of ultimate aim,
we can and do call . each other friend. As of
old, when they went up to the temple to
pray bo we have come to call down upon our
selves the blessings of larger friendships and
the continued growth through breadth of out
look, of purpose, of association of work that
"loves neighbor as thyself," but no more.'
Students in social science tell us that Â¦ the
promotion of human sympathy is the moral
force most needed to-day. This is but another
term for reciprocity and that is the fundar
mental theory of federation. I hope the key
note of every session of this. meeting will be
"reciprocity," give and take, always in the
spirit of true helpfulness. And the thought of
reciprocity must not be limited to those who
are "of us."- We are here to consider new
methods and larger plans. And nothing should
claim our more serious consideration than the
needs of the women and children of this State
that we, as women in organization, can be help
ful to. Consciously or unconsciously your pro
gramme committee has invited you . to share
in a programme which trends to this one
thought. In' sleeking a subject or cause that
'shall be the unifying one for all the States
In general federation they, too, must come to
this subject of motherhood ' and childhood ' that
alway and alway is dear to the thought and
heart and life of woman.
Growth of Federation.
Kindly words of welcome, graciously given,
always fall most pleasantly on the ear of the
sojourner within strange gates, but if the spo
ken word was all it might prove to be the
source of later disappointment. But you have
spoken the word of promised welcome to the
eye before speaking it to the heart. In all
the details of arrangements that have met us
from the moment we crossed the bay or cams
in from the mountains and valleys to this city
of clubs and homes â to this comfortable, at
tractive hall, with Its carefully thought out
preparations, welcome has spoken to us on
every hand.
Surely you have carried out the spirit of
Shakespeare, â¢ and more, when ho wrote, "Sir,
you are very welcome to our house; it must ap
pear in other ways than words." And yet we
would not have the words omitted, for with
them conies the expression of soul that can
never be put into /"things."
"Welcome." ' Magic of humanity and divin
ity In the loving, gracious word.
"Welcome." It is a home-light streaming
at the wayside, a pathway of light from the
dark and lonesome highway to the cheery com
fort and loving companionship around the
hearthstone, and whether It be the gleam of
the candle in the cottage window shining out
clearer and fainter that the glory of the dis
tant star or the radiance of a thousand chan
daliers flooding the darkness from a hundred
palace windows, both proclaim with equal
warmth, "welcome." "A hundred thousand
welcomes aremo more than one."
"Welcome." The word is music even when
uttered by the harshest voice. It interprets
itself in all languages. How pleasantly then
does it echo itself in our hearts when spoken
by voices that ring true and clear as a silver
bell with sincerity and affection and framed
in a language made sweet to U3 forever by
our mother's voice. , -
"Welcome." What response can be made
to this countersign of hospitality by guest or
wayfarer save to hold out both our hands with
open palms â to â¢ meet and cling to the loving
hand-clasp that is sister to the word?
Mrs. Louis Welnmann, vice president of
the San Francisco district, followed the
Mayor and spoke of the growth of the
federation. She said that the federation
did for the club what the club did for the
Ivoman and urged greater -cohesion and
jnity, because each one might be both
a. teacher and a pupil. ; Â¦
The response to the address of welcome
was made by the president, Mrs. Robert
J. Burdette, who spoke as follows:

srty-loving men and women of San Francisco,

Mrs. Burdette called the meeting to or

and Mrs. I. M. Condit of Oakland deliv
ered the Invocation. After a 'cello eolo by

As soon as the doors were opened for
the afternoon session the floor, which
was reserved for delegates and club
members, rapidly filled. The gallery was
thrown open to visitors and every seat
was taken, a few gray-bearded men being
conspicuous among the spectators. A few
minutes before the opening hour Mrs.
Robert J. Burdette, the president, escort
ed Mayor Schmitz to the stage. The fol
lowing officers were grouped about the
Mayor and president:
The committee was in cession for sev
eral hours and finally selected Mrs. Kate
Bulkley, president of the Ebell Society
of Oakland. Her nomination was agree
ably received by those members of the
federation who were apprised of the ac
tion of the committee. Mrs. Bulkley has
long been ' an active worker in women's
clubs and stands high in the councils of
the federation.
While the delegates were busy register
ing the nominating, committee was busily
engaged In selecting a candidate for the
presidency of the federation. Some
months ago the name of Mrs. Lovell
White was proposed for the presidency,
but she positively declined to act. It was
said that the vote taken by some of the
clubs on the question of admitting dele
gates from the clubs composed of colored
Â¦women caused this action, but Mrs. White
declined to state her reasons. She re
mained firm in her determination not to

crown of all Is that the love of women is
sweet to the hearts of women, and so holding

"Earth green and the blue sky above you.
And rivers that ripple your name, .
And a soul that is singing: 'I love you'
And dust take the red- leaves of Fame!
For a touch that is tender and human

And the beautiful love of a woman
Sets life to the sons of a dream.

ZBCPOBTANT SCIEU TJJb'lC DIS-
COVEXY.
A Clinical Preparation That Positive-
ly Kills the Dandruff Germ, j
A most lTniwrtajnt discovery has been
made after a year's patient laboratory
work aimed in a certain directionâ it is
NewbTo's Herpicide, a preparation that
cures baldness, prevents falling hair, and
speedily and permanently eradicates daji-
dniff. These evils are caused by a germ
or parasite that burrows into the scalp,
throwing up dandruff, as it seeks tasap
the life of the hair at the rooi. There's
no baldness without falling or thin hair,
no thin half' without dandruff, and no
dandruff if the germ is destroyed. New-
bro's Herpicide is the only preparation
that will do the work. "Destroy the
cause, you remove the effect"

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. 4. â There was, an 'attempt
on the part of an element of professional opera
tors to awaken some speculative interest in the
market this morning, but the general disposi
tion was to acquiescence . in dullness: and neg
lect after yesterday's disappointed expectation
of a decision in the Northern. Securities .case.
It is the general opinion in the financial dis
trict that any pronounced financial activity
must await the delayed decision in this case,
or some striking ' new development In general
conditions. The professional element which at
tempted to contest this obvious tendency this
HiOrning was making very moderate progress
when the announcement came of engagements
of gold for export on Thursday to the amount
of $3,750,000. The market then immediately
flattened out, the greater part of the gains
being lust and was neglected and lethargic
for the rest of the day. The. day's small busi
ness was largely congested In Amalgamated
Copper. -Southern Pacific, Sugar and Metropoli
tan. The dealings otherwise, even in the great
transcontinental and Pacific railroads and in
United States Steel, were of quite insignificant
proportions. Amalgamated Copper was; weak
on the sharp break In the London copper mar
ket and on the, first, reaction for copper in the
local metal market' since the market turned
upward. The strength of Sugar was based on
the recent stock argument o* a probable ex
emption of Cuban sugar duties. The operations
in Southern Pacific 'were largely In the hands
of the speculative pool in the stock. Metro
politan Street Railway recovered sharply, from
yesterday's -depression on the", assurance from
W. C. Whitney that his coming retirement
from business would not involve the liquida
tion of his hol'l'iig-s. There ,werÂ» some wide
movements among' the less prominent stocks.
Lackawarna rose 3 points ' higher than yester
day's high price, but reatted 4 points. Nash
ville. Chattanooga and St. Louis advanced ioÂ£i
points on. light transactions and without-ex
planation. Minneapolis. St. Paul and Sault
Ste. Marie â¢ stocks rose 4 and' ii points respect
ively for the common and preferred, but saved
net gains. of. only 2V4 and 3%. . American Ex
press and United States Express made sharp
gains. The engagement of-gold for- export- had
only a slight hardening Influence on the money
market, but the doubt as to the . extent to
which the movement may reach caused some
uneasiness over the outlook. It Is believed
that last week's large loan expansion repre
sented the shifting emigrations due toforeien
creditors to the" local banks, and that the gold
Â°? 5VÂ», h P f/ m^ nt of o loans - The declaration
of a V_'Â« dividend on Standard Oil. the Ram
as for me first quarter of last year and the
year before, was regarded as of some sienifl
cauce. as It was feared thatuhe recent fall in
the price of oil would lead to a reduction of tl'c
dividend. The market closed dull and heavy
the tone being somewhat accentuated by the
report of the rejection of peace overture*, bv

GENERAL SUMMARY.
The weather has continued cold and frosty
in all pans of the State during the week, mod
erntir.g slightly toward the close. Rain has
la'.ien in all section*, and hail, sleet and snow
Etirms have occurred in porlicns of Southern
California.
Orain prospect* In the Sacramento Valley are
reported better than lor several seasons at this
period, and in all the central and northern dis
tÂ»;3ts wheat and barley are in excellent condi
tion; growth has been slow Curing the cold
wtatfcer. but there is abundant moisture, and
with warm weather the growth will be rapid
ar.d healthy. In the southern districts the Te
wnt rains have materially Improved the con
dition of Grain, and in raj y places a nearly
average crop is predicted.
Piowir.g and seeding are progressing and in
soinc- of the southern counties farmers are in
cr.'aEing their grain acreage. Green feed has
been fclightly damaged toy frosts in eome sec
tic:Â»y. but is Etjll abundant except in portions
of the south, end stock are generally in good
ccr.diticn.
Deciducus fruit trees and vineyards are in
excellent condition and have been greatly bene
fit'd by the continued cool weather, which has
checked too early development.
TJnprotectol citrus fruits in portions of the
Saa Joaquin Valley and Southern California
rnve been injured by recent frosts, but as
fcmple trarninps were given it is probable the
less'will not bs heavy. Same damage was done
Ijy the hail and sleet in districts near the foot
hills. ,
SACRAMENTO VALLEY
Cold weather continued during the wesk.
uith heavy frosts. Rain Saturday night was
beneficial to growing crops. Green feed lias
bctii somewhat damaged by frosts and grain
hes taad& slow growth, but the cold weather
is considered generally beneficial, especially to
deciduous fruit trees. Grain is in excellent
<>-nditiCT! and with warmer weather will make
repid growth. Prospects lor heavy crops of
grain and deciduous fruits were never b?ttÂ«r
at this date. Pasturage is plentiful and stock
are in good condition.
COAFT AND BAY SECTIONS. -
Cold weather has prevailed during the week.
with heavy frosts. Rain has fallen In all sec
tiens. treatly benefiting crain and pasturage.
Greta leed has been slightly damaged by the
frosts and grain has made slow growth, but
in ether respects the conditions have been gen
erally favorable. Farm work has progressed
rapidly snd plowing and seeding will Eoon be
completed. An -unusually Jaree - acreage of
grain and hay has been, sown in Sonoma
Ojunty. Tree and vine pruning are progress
ing and in Santa Clara and Sonoma counties
the acreage in vineyards and orchards is being
materially increased. Almonds are in full
bloom in San Luis Obispo.
SAN JOAQUIX VALLET
The "weather lias been cold and frosty dur
ing .the week, retarding the growth of grain
end causing some damage to green feed and
unprotected citrus fruits, but benefiting decidu
ous fruit trees and vineyards. Rain at the
ciase of the week greatly improved the con
d-tion or pralr. and pasturage. It is reported
that in Kern, Kings, Madera and Tulare coun
t cs c great deal of wheat has been ruined by
the dry weather and a light crop is probable.
In the northern counties grain is in much' bet
ter condition and will probably yield an aver
sg* crop. Fasturage is scarce In some ' sec
tions *nd stock are not doing very well. Plow
ins and eeedir.g are progressing. .
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
Cold,' frosty weather prevailed- during the
frst of the week, accompanied by rain, hail
snd light snow in the interior districts and
heavy snow in the mountains. The weather
l*caro<Â» v.-armcr at the close of the week
and light t-howers fell in most sections.
Cltru* fruits were slightly injured in some
places by irosts and hail. Grain and feed are
Improving rapidly and prospects are much bet
ter than during January. In some sections it
Is reported that a considerable acreage of grain
lar.fl will have to be reseeded. Plowing anj
needing Â»re processing rapidly. \KiIlingr fronts
?â¢ccurred at many points, but ample warnings
were Bive:i and the loss has been kept down
by fires ar.fl smudges.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARY.â Cold week,
with frost, rain, enow and hall, but reports
ray little damage if any to citrus fruits. Â¦ Or
< hardiet* used smudsre flres Sunday. Rain too

25-lb boxes. Fruit of fair quality offers in
some quarters at %c under. Oregon prunes are

CHICAGO; Feb. 4â Com again attracted the
most attention on the. floor, although trade was
not large, j Early buying on the cold weather
reports, especially by the Southwest and some
of the local crowd ' fcr investment, occasioned
a fair adyan.ee. There was some bullish news
from -Kansas City, and cables were strong,
though Liverpool^ reported a dull market. Re
ceipts were small. May opened with some
strength and sold up to 64%c, but selling by
locals and predictions of moderating weather
broke the market toward the end of the ses
sion. â¢ May sold down to 63%c, but rallied
again on good covering and sold at 63%@64c-
This revival, however, was not â¢ long-lived anj
May closed easy, %c down at 63%@<53%c. - -
Wheat had rather a dull day. The change In
prices was limited to %c. The cold weather,
while having an . independent bullish effect in
this pit. influenced strength- more by its direct
effect through corn. The early sentiment was
bullish An corn, . but later wh,eat turned inde
pendent and bearish. The local crowd sold and
prices ; declined. Receipts, both local and
Northwestern, were small and the world's
visible" supply decreased .731,000 bushels. On
these influences "May started %c up at.'78%c
and sold up a shade. When the sentiment
turned the market held very well considering
the selling pressure and May closed easy J ,4@
%c lower at 78%@78%c. New York reported
discouraging export news, saying Â¦ that the
business was largely confined to Manitoba
wheat which ! was being secured under the
prices for American.
Oats were again dull and prices fluctuated in
sympathy with corn over a very, narrow range.
May closed steady, %c down at 44Vi@4-i%c.
There was a demand for pork at the open

products closed 2%c higher.

Receipts of Butter are larger, and while the
market is still quoted firm, there is lesn tend

the ' toD has been reached. Stocks on the
floors are light, however, and as supplies of
packed goods are practically exhausted the
retail demand for the fresh product is larger.
Cheese is steady an^ unchanged,
Arrivals of Eggs are slowly increasing again,
but as stocks are light and the demand is
good, - there Is no weakness apparent. At the
same time the tendency among the trads is to
sell, aa everybody looks for a decline at this
time of the year.
Receipts were 45,400 pounds, 22 tubs and 18

tinued in the House to-day and the pros

Hansbrough of North Dakota made a
spirited defense of Judge Arthur H. Noyes
of the District Court of Alaska, and Alex
ander McKenzie, upon whom an attack
was made in the Senate yesterday. This
precipitated a long discussion of the
Xoyes case, legal and technical, rather
than personal. No action could be taken
on this subject, but the discussion wiil be
continued to-morrow under the latitude
allowed when appropriation bills are
pending.
John F. Dryden. was inducted Into of

WASHINGTON*, Feb. 4.â After brief dis
cussion to-day the Senate passed the bill
providing for a 25 per cent increase in the
salaries of United States Judges. All
amendments were voted down. Including
one to Increase the salaries of Cabinet of
ficers from $8000 to $12,500 a year.
President Gompers, speaking* in behalf
of the Federation- of Labor, said he de
sired to correct the impression" that Chi
nesÂ© exclusion was desired solely by the
Pacific Coast States.. He said It was
asked for by. all the organized wage^earn
ers, regardless of the section from which
they hail. . . .:Â¦
After fifteen years of careful study, he
said, it was his firm conviction that the
United States lost' her seamen because of
the treatment she gave them and he con
cluded by saying it was not- safe to put
the merchant marine of the Pacific Into
the hands of the Chinese. â¢
Asked to name the warships he' had re
ferred to, he. could recall but five and
mentioned the. Oregon, Iowa, Texas, New
York and Brooklyn. In response to ques
tions by Clay and Fairbanks, he said his
remarks applied to skilled seamen, re
gardless of nationality. On one occasion,
he said, he visited a Government ship at
tho. Washington navy-yard and out of
twenty-one men Â¦ aboard her only one was
a native American. â¢
Furuseth, - in answer to Penrose, said
that the ship subsidy .bill as it stands
now would; not have. a tendency to bring
more sailors aboard I ships or to amelior
ate "or improve their condition. He de
clared that he had obtained information
from an official in the -Bureau of Naviga
tion of the navy that during the war with
Spain we had only six properly manned
warships. This led to considerable ques
tioning ,and : Fairbanks wanted to know
the name of that official .who gave this
information, but Furuseth could not re
call it, saying, however, it could easily
be ascertained. Â¦ â¢ â¢
Andrew. Furuseth, on, behalf of, the sea
men, spoke of the unreliability, of. the Chi
nese sailors in time of emergencies on
shipboard. He cited the collision between
the City of Chester and the Oceanic at
the Golden Gate. The former vessel,
manned, by. American seamen, was sunk,
but the Oceanic^ Chinese crew rendered
no assistance, having become terrorized,
and it remained for some of the American
sailors of the Chester to go to the Oceanic,
man her boats and enter upon the work of
rescue. -He ; alaa cited . the case of the
United States transport Lennox, disabled
in the Pacific, whose Chinese crew refused
to man the boats to bring assistance.

Committee on Immigration to-day heard

WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.â Senator Hoar
to-day presented a petition signed by a
number of distinguished citizens of, this
country for the \ suspension of hostilities
in the Philippines and asking that an op
portunity be given for a discussion of the
situation between the .Government and
the Filipino leaders.
Hostilities in Philippines.
CONFERENCE IS SUGGESTED.
Senator Hoar Asks for Suspension of
This led him to speak of the triats of
the Filipinos, one of which he said is cru
elty. He had been told by the American
army officers of many instances of muti
lation of the corpses of. our soldiers. This
being true, it was not surprising that
there had been some retaliation on the
part of some- of the small bands of sol
diers. He had heard of no charge of mu
tilation, but there were probably some
cases of unnecessary killing, some cases
of whipping and some cases of what is
called the "water cure," a method of pun
ishment consisting of pouring water down
the throats of men until they would; swell
up, and- becoming frightened would tell
what they might know, aSt forinstohce,
to wher.t! guns could . be secured. In
this connection he called attention to the
orders of General MacArthur as to these
practices, which were, he said, very strict.
When these infractions of propriety had
occurred he was sure'they had been in the
face of direct orders to the contrary.
"I venture to say that there is not a
Filipino general or commanding officer
who could not be convicted of responsible
ity for the killing of their people." .
Governor Taft also said that the great
majority of the people of the islands de
sire peace, and that the insurrectionists
we're by their acts preventing the mass
of the people from settling down and
earning a quiet living. Instead of being
allowed to do this they are kept under a
system of terrorism, which should be
stopped.
Tho condition of activity continued un
til the last Presidential election in the
United States, said the Governor. Th6 in
surgents believed that if Bryan should be
elected there would be a change of pol
icy and the islands surrendered, . placing
those who were in insurrection in charge,
but when McKinley was elected there was
a feeling that there would be an indefinite
retention of the archipelago and that the
system then in force would be continued.
Discussing the effect of the guerrilla
warfare Governor Taft said it often re
sulted In the murder of , the Filipinos
themselves. ' â¢ ' . r
"The war has been all over in these isl
ands, and that which remains is a crime
against civilization. It is also a^ crime
against the Filipino people to keep up a
st ate of war under the circumstances.
They have worn out the right to -any
treatment but that which is severe and
within the laws of war."
Aguinaldo >aid that if he did not kill
Luna, Luna would kill him. Indeed, the
custom was to order a man's death in his
absence and have him killed upon his re
turn. The presence of these I guerrilla
bands rendered tt' necessary to placo gar
risons everywhere, there being at one
time as many as 500 of them. This ren
dered the work .before the army very
arduous, and the activity, the skill and
the bravery .of the American troops were
such as to soon render the enemy tired oÂ£
warfare. Speaking of the military policy
in the Philippines Governor Taft said:
Then, in order to give the army its just
due, he took up and analyzed its work in
the islands. He recalled that as soon as
General Otis had received reinforcements
sufficient for his purposes the Philippine
army had broken up and scattered into
gue.rrllla bands. On this point Agtiinaldo
and Luna had differed,. Luna advocating
the continuance, of the war on the old
lines. So sharp was this difference, he
said, that Aguinaldo, had directed and se
cured : the assassination* of. Luna, thus
leaving- the way open for the carrying out
of his own plans. He would not, he said,
report the incident if it had not been posi
tively reported to him by General I'uns-.
ton.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 4.â Governor Taft
to-day continued his narrative before- tho
Senate Committee on the Philippines con
cerning conditions in the Philippine arch
ipelago. Referring to his testimony of yes
terday, he said he feared he had given a
wrong impression concerning the part tho
army had played In bringing the insurrec
tion to an end, but if so this was due to
the fact that he could not present a cor
rect impression ' of tho whole situation
from one point of view.

â¢ James B. Stobie, a resident of Klamath
County, Oregon, was called to the stand
and asked as to "Bob" Courtwright's
reputation in Oregon, but tho questions
were ruled out. The witness was then
asked if on the 15th of May last he had
not. seen John - Hutton on the road near
Tuie Lake (on the border line between
Oregon and California). The prosecution
objected and an argument which lasted
all the afternoon followed. Both sides in
troduced many authorities to support
their claims, and the question had. not
been decided when the court adjourned.
Judge Harrington revoked the order and
permitted Judge Spencer to return to-the
courtroom. . . ,
Boyd of the prosecution, who is from
Lassen County, arose and asked the court
to revoke tWe order . for imprisoning
Spencer, as he was an old, gray-haired
man. He said that in Lassen County. Mr.
Spencer was looked upon as the "daddy"
of the bar and that he (Boyd, being one
of tho younger members of that bar, took
the liberty of asking Judge Harrington
to let Mr. Spencer's offense pass.
Boyd. Pleads : for Spencer.
Raker begged the indulgence of the
court and asked him. to- revoke his order.
The court said he was sick and tired of.
tho insults that had been piled upon him
by the attorneys for tho defense; that
just as the affairs of court settled down
to a calm basis some one of the attorneys
for tho defense had to Â¦ thr<5w fat on the
fire and rekindle the flames; that there
was a limit to patience; that his every
action had been construed by the counsel
for the defense as opposed to the-de
fendant, "Jim" Brown, and that he would
not stand any further insults and abuse.
Mr.' Boyd. please get the remarks of Mr.
Spenoer from the i reporter and .write out a
commitment. Mr. Spencer will go to jail until
6 o'clock to-night. '. . Â¦ . - - .
Spencer continued his sarcastic reflec
tions and was cut off .by the court threat
ening him with punishment for contempt.
Spencer â I'll talk aa long as he does. I won't
be shut off from replying to his remarks.
The Court â Mr. Sheriff, take Mr. Spencer
from the room. ' . Â¦ ''

Quarrel Is Later Resumed.
As soon as court opened this morning
Raker precipitated the usual row by mak
ing application to the court to be per
mitted to read from Jervus Kresge's tes
timony before the Grand Jury. Judge
Harrington ruled that the defense might
question the witness only on such mat
ters as might explain any discrepancy be
tween the testimony given ontne stand
and that given betore the Grand Jury.
Incidentally he remarked that the. court
was as strong as the Rock of Gibraltar
and when once a ruling was made it could
not be changed by any sophistries ami
tricks by Raker to inject into the case
old questions under new covers. Â¦â¢ . Â¦
Raker continued to argue, and the
court threatened to dismiss the jury from
the room if ha did not cease. . .
After the court had ruled Post ex
plained that the prosecution did not desire
to shut -witnesses off from making state

McLean & Tate. loss on building. $35,000;
Herman Ruppelt, job printer, $10,000; scat
tering, $3000.
The building in which the .fire originated
was located in the' old. business section of
the city and was about fifty years old.
The blaze, which proved a hard one for
the fire department to 'master, had been
got practically under control, when sud
denly the building- collapsed. Three pipe
men, at work on the second floor, had
had difficulty in managing a line of hose
and Assistant Chief Thierry was on his
way with three of his men to lend them
aid. The men went down with tons of
twisted iron, brick and wooden columns
enveloping them. -
ST. LOUIS, Feb. 4.â At least ten men
were killed and as many, more injured-.at
a fire which broke out to-night in the

I think a splendid advertisement for the
State would bÂ» a luncheon - every day with
California fruit and California wines served.
We have the finest forestry specimens In
the world, and owing to St. Louis being so near
to us we will take live specimens back with
us and place them In the exhibition. One speci
men will be a sugarpine twelve feet in diame
ter. We would have liked to have taken speci
mens of forestry back to Paris, but it was im
practicable. St. Louis being so near we will
have no difficulty in making a splendid show-
Ing in forestry there.
There is onlv one more remark I would like
to make: The California Legislature does not
mept until January" of next year and it will
then be too late to make an appropriation.
What we would like now is for counties to
make appropriations to boom their districts.
Should they spend money in this way we will
have all the more left to spend In other chan
nels. Several counties have already communi
cated with me and have appropriated hand
some sums' toward the exhibition. I am also
very anxious to get horticulturists and others
to make donations.
County Exhibits Desired.
The Southern Pacific Company has already
dispatched a representative to Manila to col
"lect specimens of cabinet woods from the Phil
ippine Islands. The great fault with California,
at the present time Is tho dearth of 'cabinet
â¢woods We feel, however, that -when a con
servative trade is established between this
country and Manila San Francisco will be the
1 great cabinet wood center of the United States.
We intend to have a large globe made, -which
will show the great importance of San Fran
| Cisco as a commercial port, and owing to our
liberal allowance we intend to have some large
i niaps made alf=o. We have as an attraction
eplendid biograph pictures of the ferry-boats
i on San Francisco Bay and our street-car sys
; terns. We will also take fine pictures of the
I splendid forests of California and moving pic
tures of scenes in Golden Gate Park. On a
special day we will ask the residents of San
Francisco who own private equipages to as
semble in Golden Gate Park and we will take
a blograph picture . of the scene to let the
Kastera people 1 know that we are not behind
the times. ~
Typical San Francisco Scene.
The Southern Pacific Company has received
a very liberal appropriation from President
Harriman for the St. Louis Exposition, wnicli
opens In April of next year. Wo havÂ« already
made application for two spaces in the exposi
tion. One will be for an exhibition in a pa
vilion, showing the resources ot the States ana
Territories that the Southern Pacific passes
over; the other space will be used in making
a good representation of San Francisco s posi
tion in the commercial world.
You must, understand that San Francisco is
the western terminus of the Harriman system
of roadS and it is the wish of the president
to give all visitors an Idea of the Importance
of this city. In the State and Territory ex
hibit California. Oregon. Nevada. Texas and
Louisiana will be represented.
For the' St Louis exhibit Texas ha* appro
priated $750,000 and Colorado $700,000. the lat

The Southern Pacific Company, through
the generosity of President E. H. Harri
man. intends . to Â¦ make a splendid exhibit
at the St. Louis fair which will be of.
great benefit to California, and especially
to San Francisco. W. H. Mills, land
agent of the company, will have charge of
the exhibit. He says of the matter:
TAFT ADVISES
SHARP ACTION
MoSes A. Hearne was 69 years of age.
He b/td followed mining for many years
and . success. He died owning prop
erty in Delamar, Nevada City and . other
places, and with $40,000 cash in a local
bank. The heir to all this property is his
only iiving relative, a son, John F. Hearne
of Redding and Dunsmuir. Twelve or
flfteen years ago Hearne went to Shasta
County and located the Hearne group of
copper claims near Kennett.. The Shasta
King is the principal mine of the group.
The enlire group was sold to the Trinity
Copper Company about a year, ago for
$30,000.
Hearne was a living thermometer.. He
lived for years at Nevada City and
worked as an amalgamator and assayer
until his system absorbed so much mer
cury that his final years' brought frequent
pain. Pie was keenly, sensitive to changts
m the weather and in winter suffered
acutely with .rheumatism of his joints.
In warm weather he raised erect to his
full six feet 2 inches. On a cold day he
could -hardly move about and his whole
nature was at the lowest ebb. He de
clared that he absolutely reflected the
size and dropping of the mercury in' his
system.
Moses A. Hearne, one of the best known
mining, men in this State, died early yes
terday morning at the Golden West Ho
tel. He had been ailing for several
months, and his death was not un
expected. â¢ â¢
The crowd about the undertaking es
tablishment became so great that the
doors were closed by the police on ! ac
count of the crush. Thousands of people,
mostly -women, were unable to gain ad
mission to view the bodies, and for sev
eral hours after the closing of the doors)
hundreds lingered about the place, hop
ing, that the doors would be opened again.
Many women carried flowers for the dead,
which they left with the undertaker to bÂ«
placed on the grave to-morrow.
On the caskets" of the Blddle3 were
sprig3 of fern and white carnations sent
for the, purpose by some woman whose
identity is unknown. The flowers . were
sent to- the undertaker, with the request
that they be placed upon the caskets,
and that it be known everywhere that
they were the gift of a woman.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Feb. t-From ? to 13
o'clock to-day the bodies of John { and
Edward Biddle were exposed to public
view at an undertaking . establishment
and' several thousand persons passed be
fore the coffins. In the crowd were prob
ably as many women as men. The burial
will take place to-morrow morning in one
large grave in Calvary Cemetery. No ar
rangements have as yet been made for
the attendance of a priest or minister.
Robb told her he was a friend of her
husband and would like to lighten the
burden of his sorrow and disgrace, but
could not make any definite promise to
her at this time. When she had finished
her pleadings Robb questioned her with
particular reference to the places where
the party took refuge in their flight. She
listened, but refused to make any reply
that, would incriminate' those who werÂ«
conriected with the plot.
â¢In tears and piteous pleading she mad*
this request to Assistant District Attor
ney Rcbb of Allegheny County in the hos
pital here to-day. She said she would go
anywhere to have the punishment meted
out to her for her crime. She Is willing
to meet any fate the law may place upon
her, but does not want . the punishment
administered in the Courthouse across the
street from her old home. Â¦ She beggetl
and pleaded with Robb for almost two
hours to grant her this much. She
begged in the name of her husband, who
is Kobb's friend, and told him that hsr
husband "was in no way to blame fur her
shameful conduct. '

JUDGES GAIN
HIGHER SALARY
As a member of the football team Ford
was accorded the privileges of the club
and was entered on the books as an
"athletic member." As soon as the board
of directors learned Ford or Davis' true
character they expelled him for "non-pay
ment of dues." Ford has cards for other
clubs, but will not be able to use the
magic pasteboards to gain admission to
tlio exclusive organizations. He created
a wido swath in local society on nothing.
Wh*rievÂ£r he desired to dine out or at
tend a cotillon' hp had 10 hire a dress suit.-
The following day he would dispel his
dream" of happiness by returning the
clothes. â¢ Thosp gentlemen who stood
sponsor for Ford will have a nice time
explaining their conduct.
Ford's method of operating in Indian
apolis was to secure an introduction to
some prominent society women, usually
married, and after securing a ring or
jewel from her pawn it. His dupes never
dared call him to account for fear he
would compromise them. He was arrested
at one time and but for the aid extended
him by a rich relative would have suf
fered long imprisonment. His picture was
taken at that time and duplicates were
sent over the country. A set adorns the
archives of the local police department. I
On December 19 he "registered at the
exclusive Knickerbocker. Hotel, on Van
Ness avenue, giving as references the
names of several highly connected people
of' the city. During his residence at the
Knickerbocker he was enabled to run up
a bill-wltb. Kelly Brothers, the liverymen.
It was in consequence of his indebted
ness to them that trouble ensued and he
was told by Mrs. Robinson that his room
was required. Ford left a two weeks' bill
behind him.
On November 10 Ford registered at the
Eugene House, on O'Farrell street, in
forming the proprietor that he had been
engaged to appear at the Orpheum. On
the strength of that assertion he was al
lowed to run up a bill of $30.
At 'the Palace Ford posed as a Ndw
York business man. He made himself
affable to all with- whom he came in con
tact and it was not until he was accomo
dated with a loan of JSO by a young
Southerner, a tourist from Tennessee,
that the slightest suspicion fell upon him.
He failed to return the sum and left the
hostelry.
The expose of this "social highwayman"
has created a sensation in social and club
circles. Although Ford has been here but
three months ne has by suave address
and abaundant nerve lormed acquaint
ances among the leading set of this city.
Ford made his first appearance here on
November 7 last. He arrived in the com
pany of D. Beeman of chewing gum lame
and took up quarters at the Palace. He
posed as a graduate of Cornell and gave
out the information that he had played
end 'on his college team. The Olympic
Club was looking- for strong material tor
its eleven and Ford was quickly engaged.
He proved a good player and was picked
to so to Hawaii with the team, but un
fortunately for him the trip fell through.
Society has received an awful shock to
its refined sensibilties. Discussion is rife
at teas over the fact that Paul Davis
Ford, alias H. F. Davis, alias Frohman,
alias Jules Harvey Ford, and many other
aliases, who is well known to the polico
of the large Eastern cities, had been re
ceived and dined by the first families of
this city. Society discovered too late that
the suave young Easterner, who ingra
tiated himself into the good ' graces of
matron and belle, and partook of hospi
tality willingly extended, had been In
prison for various offenses and that his
picture reposed in the rogues' gallery of
the Indianapolis police.
Mr. Collins, who is president of the
local Y. M. C. A., left with Mrs. Collins,
tr.e Rev. E. E. Baker, Mr. and Mrs. H. J.
McCoy of the San Francisco Y. M. C. A.
and Mr. and Mrs. Kling on the morning
train for Los Angeles.
William Lair Hill corroborates Mr.
Richardson in regard to the refusal to
postpone, but pays that he could not con
sent to the proposition. He says he pro
posed to take the deposition last week,
but that this was not satisfactory to his
opponents. He says also that he tried to
serve a subpena, but couldn't.
J. B. Richardson and Henry Ach, Mr.
Collins' attorneys, were uotiiied a week
ugo by William Lair Hill, the commis
sioner, that the deposition wouid be tanen
To-day. On behair of their client tney
askca that the taking ot it be postponed
until alter his return irom the conven
tion* but according to the attorneys tins
request was deniea. Hut in me meantime
Mr. Collins was nc-t served with a suii
pena. so he was not bound to attend tins
morning.
"I think the other side thought the no
tice to the attorneys representing Mr.
Collins was sufficient," said Mr. Richard
son in explanation, '"and forgot about the
subpena. We'll be ready, however, after
tls return from the south."
D. Edward Collins' deposition was to
have been taken to-day to assist the cas-i
of Dr. George C. Pardee. Henry P. Dal
lon, G. B. Daniels and other members of
the inquirer Publishing Company, which
he is suing for au accounting, but when
that gentleman's name was called at 10
o'clock in William Lair Hill's office,
where Mrs. Sarah M. Stccle. a notary,
Â¦was ready to proceed, there was no re
sponse. The reason for Mr. Collins" non
appearance was that he had not been
served with a subpena and had more
pressing business at Pasadena, where he
is a delegate to the State convention of
me Young Men's Christian Associations.

A REPORT OF PROGRESS;.
The following extract from report of work
done to January 22 Is of Interest to share-
holders and others. The full report' will be
mailed on request:
"TACOMA. Wash., Jan. 27.
"Owing to the lateness of the season, we
established camp on the eastern side of our
property and built a mile of trail. We have
a comfortable camp â bunkhouses, cookhouse,
toolhouse, and will soon have a stable with
accommodations for 15 horses. â¢ â¢ â¢ We
have driven one entry 44 feet through hard
rock, but are now into a softer rock, which
Is a sort of gangue between the country
rock and the vein. This entry Is being
driven to reach a vein of ore which show3
over 100 feet on the surface, and gave an
assay of $12 SO per ton, principally gold.
This vein can be traced for 20CO feet through
the 'Stray Beauty Extension', and 'Lourette'
claims. We confidently expect to reach this
vein ten feet from the end of our present
workings. We have commenced a new entry
100 feet lower on the vein above mentioned,
and are In 15 feet We expect to reach the
vein about 40 feet from the beginning of the
" tunnel. There Is also a large vein of goid-
\ bearing quartz on the 'Stray Beauty" which
we shall endeavor to open as soon as cir-
cumstances will permit. This vein is well
defined, is 60 feet wide, and runs parallel
' to the one on which we are now working.
There. Is also a large vein visible on the
'Ben G'. claim, another on the 'Sulphide.'
and a five-foot vein on the 'Ruby Jewel.'
All these veins can be worked from our
present camp. The veins referred : to arÂ«

WANTEDâ
MACHINISTS AND HANDY MEN TO KNOW
THAT THE MACHINISTS' STRIKE IS
PRACTICALLY OVER. . *
ALL SHOPS RUNNING AS USUAL.
The machinists' strike that has been on In the
principal Denver shops since October is now
practically broken, as the shops are running
with non-union men and only about 25 per cent
of the strikers remain in town, walking the
streets. Â¦, .
The victory claimed by the strikers at the
Colorado Iron Work3 Company is In reality a
defeat. The men went out for a nine-hour day,
whereas this is the very point not conceded by
the Colorado Iron Works Company. A number
of the old men from the Colorado Iron Works
Company were' selected by the management and
offered individually their old positions, if they
would work the hours per day stipulated by the
manufacturers, and conform to their shop
rules . and regulations.
Mulberry, who is conducting the Ftrike, op-
posed this and a stormy meeting followed, un-
til the men demanded that they be allowed to
return or withdraw from the union. To make
the appearance of a victory and prevent a loss
of more men, the union were obliged to sanc-
tion the return of these men. hence the mis-
leading report in the daily papers.
This strike has demonstrated two things:
That the majority of flrst-class men are free
men and will not be bound by arbitrary unions,
and that the Denver Machinery Manufacturers
are organized as a unit to resist the unjust,
unreasonable, unbusinesslike and arbitrary de-
mands of organized labor.

We Â¦ fear that the Rooster will not have a
chance . to spread its wings over any further
political honors for the present Governor of
this State. Ex-Senator Bulla, from the Gov
ernor's own county, states emphatically that
Gage cannot control the delegation from . hla
home, county, and . from all appearances the
Senator is right. \ Â¦Â¦ ,
- The newspapers throughout the State
are taking an active Interest in public af
fairs. The Acton Rooster and Modesto
News do. not agree as to the future public
career of Governor Gage. The Rooster
having been first to name Gage for Gov
ernor now nominates him for Vice Presi
dent upon the ticket headed by President
Roosevelt. The Modesto News^ comment
ing on the Rooster's crowing enthusiasm,
says: . . : .... .
The convention could establish an order
of business providing that Judicial nom
inations should come first. The-Demo
cratic State Convention which assembled
at the Baldwin Theater in 1896 put Judicial
nominations first and James H. ' Budd
made it his special business to see that
Judge Murphy - of Del Norte was nom
inated for Justice of the Supreme Court
Later on-, when the Democrats talked of
nominating Barney Murphy of, San Jose
for Governor,, the embarrassment of hav
ing too many Murphys on the ticket be
came painfully obvious and to relieve the
situation of- its ' awkwardness Budd him
self accepted, the nomination for Gover
nor. . .----
. It is regarded as Â¦ certain that â¢ there
will be two candidates before the Re
publican State Convention for nomination
for the office of Chief Justice of the Su
preme Court. The incumbent, W. H.
Beatty, has many supporters throughout
the State, who do not hesitate to ayow
in favor of .his nomination. C. "H.-Ga
roiitte of Yolo, an associate Justice, has
many friends who favor his' promotion
to the chief place on the bench. The
Democrats are watching the contest with
unusual interest, and standing ready to
take advantage of any mistake that the
Republicans may make. Wise politicians
suggest that leading Republicans should
adopt measures to keep the contest for
the judicial positions separate from the
gubernatorial fight.
Contest Between Beatty
and Garoutte for the
Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE
SUPREME COURT
A resolution was introduced by 'Super
visor Comte directing the Board of Works
to expend -the sum -of J500O in- continuing
the" work of repaving Valencia streetÂ«The
board appropriated J28.000 to repave that
thoroughfare from Market ) street â¢ to
Eighteenth and the contract, was let for
123,000, i and it is now. proposed touutilize
the balance. The resolution was referred
to the Street Committee.
The ordinance- prohibiting frauds* on
livery stable keepers and making it un
lawful for them to use horses Intrusted to
their care, was finally passed. . Â¦
The ordinance authorizing the. Board of
Works to improve as. an experiment -the
roadway of Van Ness avenue,- between
Bush and Pine streets, by setting apart a
strip sixteen feet wide for the purpose of
planting trees and placing statuary, was.
laid over for one week. The ordinance re
ducing the width of the sidewalks, in the
block named was Indefinitely postponed. â¢
Van Ness Avenue Improvement.
Brandenstein said that the board could
pass more intelligently on the water rates
if the members would have time to study
the transcripts of the evidence given in 1900
and 1901. The board then adjourned until
next Tuesday night, when the investiga
tion will be resumed. -
.Schussler agreed to give figures on the
amount. of water drawn from the differ
ent reae'rvoirs owned by the company aa
far back as the records . go: also the
amount of water in the reservoirs at va
rious periods from 1865 to the present time.
The many resolutions directing, the com
pany to furnish information necessary to
guide the board in fixing water rates were
read and Schussler promised to comply
with their provisions where the .company
had not. already done so. - 'Â¦.-/Â¦
Grunsky said the company . had fur>
nished' a map of the pipe that' had been
laid by the company," but it was found -to
be fifty miles short of the actual length.
. "That is quite possible," replied Schuss
ler, "as we were not on good terms, with
the Board of Works at that tlin.e." \
Map r of 'Pipe Line- Defective.
Braunhart moved that the Spring Val
ley Company .be - - requested" < to furnish
within one week blue prints showing the
lands now owned and in use by the com
pany. Schussler agreed to this, but said
he must withhold a proposed purchase of
land to complete- a $1,000,000 holding of the
company.- If the information was given
the price of some land on which the com
pany had an option for. $23,000 would be
raised ta $200,000, Schussler said. '. .
This Information asked for was denied us,
as well as the data regarding the amount of
water pumped at the various stations. -. The
Information was asked because the Board of
Works Is charged with fixing a value on water
rights, and It wanted to be guided by such
figures as the company could supply.
Grunsky referred to the fact that the
company had been' directed to furnish a
map showing the location, character and
size of the pipe in its distributing system,
which had not been done. He said:
We do not 1 desire to give away . our â¢ private
business to the public. A- number of our. land
purchases are incomplete and the land, specula
tors would take advantage of the information
and raise prices tenfold. We would be wilitas
to snow a map of our real estate in confidence
to a committee of the board, but we cannot
publicly -disclose what we now own.
Ta a question of City Engineer Grunsky,
Schussler replied that it .was impossible to
make the maps of the lands owned by the
company ! within the time- Indicated and
more time was needed. Schussler said: -
Sclrussler Wants SIoto Time,
It was ascertained that tha inventory
of the company -had: been filed with the
Board of Works instead of the Super
visors. Schussler said that the figures on
the real estate ownedby the company and
other data had been filed last year and the
property purchased ' since . then . had been,
incorporated ; in thÂ© statement filed with
the Board of Works.- Schussler submitted
a copy of the statement filed with the last
named board and It was admitted la evi
dence. The resolution on the subject was
read and showed that the company* was
directed to file the inventory with the Su
pervisors. Schussler stated that "the in
formation desired would take, ten months
and 1 cost *15,00O.. ... .. Â¦::.
â¢ Brandenstein Â¦ suggested that the trai>
ecripts of the testimony taken in the twt>
former investigations of 1300 and- 1901 be.
offered in evidence and be considered as
part of the record In the present Inquiry.
Chief Engineer.; Schussler and M. B. Kel
logg,, attorney of the- Spring Valley Com
pany; assented to the proposition and a
motion on, the subject prevailed.
The first'snag experienced by the board
was the discovery, that only one state
ment regarding revenue and* expenditorea
of the Spring Valley Company, had been

FINDS FALSE ENTRY.
Justices' Clerk Fredrick Discovers
Suit on .Which Trial Fees Are
.. Â¦ Unpaid." ~ Â¦ ' ...
The Mayor's appointee as clerk of /'he
Justices' Court, Powel Fredrick,, discov
ered another irregularity yesterday in the
records' of the offlce from which Ed Wil
liams resigned.: In looking over, the pa
pers the case of "Jake" Rauer vs. Fred
H. Hood and Charles T. Bandman;
which was filed on December . 24, lSJt*;
Fredrick found that a- false entry had
been made in the docket-book purporting
to show that the trial fees had been paid.
The entry read December 9 $3. and was
written in by some person not attached to
the Office. * '-V Â¦
Fredrick immediately ordered an ex
amination of the cash books for Jive
years past, but -there was no entry- to
show that the fees had in reality been
paid. Fredrick points to this irregularity
as another instance of the laxity with
trial ' and proper proceedings had â¢ before the
Board of Supervisors of said city and county.
The acts or offenses so charged against the plain
tiff were. that plaintiff had In the mqnth of Oc
tober. Â». 1001, and prior to his nomination' as
the candidate for County. Clerk by. the -Repub
lican local convention of. the: city and county
of San Francisco, promised and agreed In writ
ing that he would procure and give .certain
employment in his office to certain persons In
censideration of 'their, aiding ' in securing . his
nomination and-., aiding in -his election, and also!
that in consldesatlon of moneys advanced to
him by various persons he' had agreed to a"p
polnt certain -other persons named by the per-;
sens advancing said moneys to positions .of
trust in. the 'office of County Clerk in the city
and county of San" Francisco in the event of
his election as such County ClerK. and that he
had carried out his said promlses;by appoint
ing sjuch. persons in some instances; . and that
such promises were made after, he been
nominated and while he was a candidate ; for
election to the offlce of County Clerk. : â¢ '
Â¦ And â¢ further that he had agreed with â¢ tlvj
.persons alleged- to have so - advanced .such
moneys to him that they should have the. right
and privilege, and -that .he would grant . them
the' business of discounting', at the- rate, of 5
pei cent. per month the salary; demands of. nil
his deputies and employes > in. the Cqunty Clerk's
offlce :f or -the- two years of -his term .'and' that
said 4>er6bns so advancing such moneys should,'
In addition to the precentages > of discounting

THE matter of the pre-election con
tract signed , by. County. Clerk
Mahony in violation of the pro
visions of the purity of election
law, by the terms of which he
agreed to- appoint ex-County Clerk Deane
as his chief deputy and which was ex
posed by The Call three weeks ago, was
taken up by the Grand Jury yesterday. â¢
It will be remembered that after the ex
posure by The Call Mayor Schmitz held
an investigation, with the result 'that he
was about to suspend Mahony when the
latter frustrated that design by securing
a writ of prohibition -In the. Superior
Court. The facts as brought out by the
inquiry' before the Mayor were brought to
the attention of the Grand Jury, with the
result thM a more searching inquiry was
resolved upon. Numerous witnesses were
subpenaed and their testimony heard
yesterday. " " . Â¦ "
. Ex-County Clerk Deane testified that
Mahony agreed to appoint him as his
chief deputy and that there was a written
contract to that effect. The contract, he
said, was drawn up by John Flood, a
copyist in his office, and was signed by
Fiood and Gregory Valero as witnesses.
Flood testified to drawing up the con
tract, and said that he had signed it with
Valero as witness. The contract was an
agreement on Mahony' s part to appoint
Deane as chief deputy. - *-
Notary Public J. J. Deane , swore that
he had seen the contract in question, and
Gregory Valero testified to. having ap-
tiff and his attorney, was had merely for the
purpose ,of . satisfying his own mind and of
acting fairly toward the plaintiff, '
The defendant denies that no willful neglect
of plaintiffs .duty as County Clerk or official
misconduct . has. cpme to the knowledge of the
defendant as . such .Mayor. * â¢â¢. Â¦ ; . '..
Denies that, .defendant . as such Mayor or
otherwise has wrongfully or otherwise has
wrongfully or unlawfully or, in excess of juris
diction or. without Jurisdiction entertained or

and denies that f9r-the purpose of,,entertain

mitted the matter' of' said complaint;, against

other purpose, and denies that defendant aÂ»
such Mayor is ' devpld of jurisdiction to 'hear
and entertain said complaint against ' plaintiff
or to act thereon. Â¦ '-'. '. ' '-'I
Charges Brought Against? Mahony.
In this behalf 'defendant' alleges that on -or
about the 14th day' of January," 1902. certain
charges and complaints against plaintiff ,were
brought to the attention of defendant as such
Mayor, wherein it was charged and alleged
that plaintiff had been guilty of certain in
famous crimes amounting to., felonies .-.in con
travention of the provision ot "An act to. pro-:
mote the .purity of elections by' regulating the
conduct thereof, and to Â¦ support the -privilege
of free suffrage by prohibiting certain acts and
practices thereof," approved February. 83. 1893;
and in contravention of the precisions of sec
tion 7, article XVI of the charts of said cfty
and county of San Francisco, 1 which charge,
acts and . offenses if true did . under said act
of the Legislature and under said charter dis
qualify the plaintiff from holding office in. the
city and county of. San Francisco, and If proven
might constitute cause for his removal, after
pended his signature thereto as a wit
ntss. Â¦ Charles McLane, â¢ a bartender, . told
of having been promised a position in the
County Clerk's office by Mahony â¢ befone
election, and that the promise was not
kept. Similar testimony was given by
Harry J. Angelo and Carl Mueller, ex
deputies in the County Clerk's offlce under
Deane. The inquiry will be resumed next
Friday afternoon.
which business was conducted in the of
fice under Williams. . : y
'. Notwithstanding that no case can come
to trial unless the fees are paid, it is a
fact that the case in point was tried by
former Justice of the Peace Carroll, was
postponed a number of times and finally
was heard" by Justice of the Peace Long,
.who rendered judgment on January 21,
Fredrick complains that owing to the
negligence of some official the case was
allowed to go to trial without the pay
ment of fees. He blames the Justices for
the oversight, and claims that they should
not try cases unless the papers ' are
stamped, showing that the fees were paid.
Ho such stamp was on the papers in the
case, and Fredrick claims that the fees
were never paid.
Â¦ Fredrick is of the opinion that similar
false entries will be found. He will, re
port the irregularity to the Mayor, who
will order the books e#perted during Wil
liams' entire term of office. Other cas^s
in the docket-oook contained no entry of
the fees having been, paid, though the
cases went to trial and judgments were
entered. .The cash books, however,
showed that the, fees had been. paid. â¢
Assistant Clerk Robert Dennis says that
the false entry -made-: in the"Rauer case
was one of the. several made by Harry
Morris, who admitted that he had h-~M
out fees amounting to $124, for which he
afterward made restitution. Dennis says
there may be more irregularities of the
same kind, and only a full investigation
by the experts will disclose them all.
herein had he stated or threatened he would
do so. â Â¦>
Denies that defendant has threatened to do
anthlng in the premises in excess of his law
ful Jurisaiction, but alleges that he, defendant
as : such Mayor, intends unless* prevented by
this" honorable court" to carefully investigate
and, consider such, charges and complaints
against defendant, " and if 'the facts presented
to ' defendant- warrant such â¢ action, and not
otherwise, defendant/ may suspend plaintiff
from said office' of, County Clerk of said City
and â¢ county, 1 - and'" thereupon present written
charges against plaintiff to said Board of Su
pervisors as by the said "charter provided.
Denies that defendant assumes to, or has.
or does, or will arbitrarily exercise any power
or authority whatever, but alleges that he Is
exercising and* will exercise only ' such power
and authority as are by law vested In him.
Denies that no action to deprive plaintiff of
or remove him from said offlce of County Clerk
can be taken except in pursuance of the terms
of-an act known as thepurity of election law.
but alleges that said plaintiff may be suspended
from said office â¢ by defendant and removed
therefrom by the said Board -of Supervisors of
