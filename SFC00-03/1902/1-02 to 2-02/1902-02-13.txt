GROSS GUILTLESS
OF THE MURDER
GIRL'S FUNERAL
THIS AFTERNOON
Both Chief Wittman and Chief of Detectives Seymour are besieged with socrcs
of people who profess to know something of the brutal murder and the Identity'
of the man who committed the deed, but when sifted down the information they
give either retards the work of the police or lends additional mystery to the brutal
crime.
The police are running down every clew that might possibly throw light on the
myfctery of Nora Fuller's murder, but thus far they have made little progress.
Clew after clew has been exploded on 'investigation.
The body of Nora Fuller will be interred this afternoon at Cypress Lawn
Cemetery. The funeral will take place from the undertaking parlors of Charles
Truman on Mason street, near Geary. The body was removed from the Morgue
yesterday afternoon and taken to the undertaking parlors. .
Detective Coleman, who brought Bennett back from Victoria, was detailed
yesterday by captain Seymour to search the city for the ex-convict. When
found he will be taken around to the various tradesmen who had dealings with
the fctrangler who traveled under the names of Bennett, Hawkins and Scott. The
I oiice have other information concerning the suspect which they refuse to divulge.
DETECTIVES HOT ON THE TRAIL OF SUSPECT.
A hack was in waiting across City Hall avenue and Bennett lost no time in
getting into it. Friends aided him in getting out of town. Later Bennett was
captured in Victoria and Policeman Coleman was sent north to bring him back.
He was tried for the brutal assault upon his wife and sent to San Quentin.
Upon his release Bennett came to this city. The police received information
yesterday that he had been seen a number of times in the neighborhood of Kear
ny and Geary streets, and as lie is a man who Is fond of the society of young
girls, they sent detectives on his trail io run him down.
When the policeman returned to the ward again Bennett was fully dressed
end back in bed again. He kept the bed clothes pulled up over him to hide his
street clothes, and a little later, when the guard again left the ward for a mo
ment Bennett made his escape through an open window.
â¢ Bennett remained at the hospital until October 14, when he made a sensa
tional escape. The policeman who had been detailed to guard Bennett was re
quested by the prisoner to go into the drug department and get some medicine,
and while he was gone the prisoner got out of bed and donned a suit of clothing
that had been ex'idently slipped into the hospital by friends, and which he had
concealed under his bed.
Then Bennett slashed his own throat- When the police arrived the room
was bespattered with blood and both Mrs. White and Bennett were found to be
In serious condition. The woman was treated for her injuries in the room
where the struggle took place, but Bennett was taken to the Receiving Hospital.
On the night of October E Mrs. White was sitting alone in her room, when
Bennett, who had been lying in wait for a good opportunity to murder her in
cold blood, entered stealthily and locked the door behind him. He was armed
with an ugly looking knife. The woman screamed for help, but before she could
make a second outcry he throttled her tind drew the' sharp blade across her throat.'
BENNETT TBIED TO SLAY HEB, IN COLD BLOOD.
Bennett's wild infatuation for his ex-wife caused the police more or less trou
ble from time to time, and he was repeatedly warned to cease bothering the
woman.
Mrs. White finally moved to 14 McAllister, street and kept her place oL resi
dence a secret for some time. But Bennett finally found her out and deliberately
laid liis plans to murder her. He visited the landlady of the house at 11 McAllis
ter street, and without making known his identity engaged lodgings on the sama
floor with his ex-wife.
Bennett made the attack upon his divorced wife for which he was sent to San
Quentin in her rooms at 14 McAllister street on the night of October 8, 1S97. The
woman had been granted a divorce from him shortly before, with permission to re
sume her former name, Mrs. Villa White. Bennett was extremely annoying to
the woman after their legal separation. He hunted her from place to place and
she could not evade his persistent attentions. He was a man of peculiarly jealous
tendencies, and the woman was in mortal fear of him. She changed her lodgings
Tepeatedly to escape him, but he always succeeded in locating her.
Since his release from the penitentiary James Bennett has been in San Fran
cisco at different periods. Neither Captain Seymour nor Chief Wittman will ad
mit that they have discovered any tangible clew tending to implicate Bennett in
the Fuller murder, but the facts connected with his attempt to end his divorced
wife's life and certain characteristics of the man cause him to fce suspected. What
is more, the description of the elusive John Bennett, alias C. B. Hawkins, fits the
ex-convict exactly.
The suspect's name is James G. Benrett, and he was sentenced to San Quen
tin by Superior Judge Wallace on February 5, 1SS7, for slashing his divorced wife
across the throat with a knife.
THE police are tracing the movements of an ex-convict to determine
whether or not he had any connection with the mysterious disappearance and
subsequent murder of Nora Fuller.
At an early hour this morning Captain Seymour declared he could con
ceive of no motive for the fiendish crime. This lack of any known motive
makes it doubly necessary to run down every clew, and the suspicion di
rected against the ex-convict for whom the police are now searching seems pecu
liarly well founded.

, Fifteen Points.
COMING events cast their shadows before. An event foreshadowed at this
time is a gigantic trust embracing the four leading express companies in
the United States. It is noted as a significant fact that the stock of
Wells, Fargo & Co. has advanced fifteen points since February 1, going
from ,130 to 205. An^upward tendency too strong to be called purely sym
, pathetic is observed In the stock or the American, Adams and United
States Express companies. In a big merger of this character many divisions of
interest must be considered and many claims of personal recognition taken
into account. It stands to plain reason that a large' retinue of high salaried
officers representing respectively the four separate managements will not be re
quired to perform the work of general administration under one management.
No doubt many of the old-time attaches and agents whose activities in the ex
press business began a third of a century ago will be compelled by the force
of events to retire from the service to rest or be forced to seek engagement in
some other line of industry, -..if"
HARBIMAN FOR PRESIDENT.
Word comes by private message from the East that E. H. Harrlman, presi
dent/of the Southern Pacific Company, will be elected to the presidency of the
Wells-Fargo Express Company at the next annual meeting of the stockholders
of the last named corporation. The Insiders would not be surprised if higher re
sponsibilities were Imposed on Harriman. He may be selected as the president
or active manager of the great express trust. As to Harriman's election to the
presidency of the Wells-Fargo Company there is hardly a question of doubt. It
appears that such selection was in contemplation when Dudley C. Evans was
recently, elected president. It was then announced that Evans was chosen to
fill the place temporarily. In -the light of subsequent events It is clear that the
scheme, to consolidate the leading companies . was then under advisement. It is
said that Evans will be assigned to duty as general manager, to succeed A.
Christiansen, in which position he will have a great deal of responsible work to
perform and b'e next to. the president 'n authority.

ANGLO-JAPANESE TREATY
MAY SOON CAUSE CLASH
Agreement'ls Regarded as an Ultimatum
, to Russia to Evacuate Manchuria.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL. BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.'.W.. WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.â Besides
creating the most profound sensation and occasioning the greatest surprise, the
publication of the Anglo-Japanese treaty is looked upon in official circles here
as in itself an ultimatum to Russia to evacuate Manchuria. The convention be
tween Russia and China for the gradual evacuation of Northern China .was to*
have been signed two weeks hence. In view oV the alliance of Great Britain and
Japan, China may now refuse to sign the convention. .
Such refusal, it is stated on high authority, will be followed by the retention \
. of Russian troops In Manchuria, But, if this be done, then Great Britain and
Japan must act under the treaty signed by them to expel Russia, Certainly
Russia will resist expulsion, and France, whose interests necessitate her act
ing with her ally, will be drawn into the conflict. To officials and diplomats
here the danger of the Manchurian situation has been intensified by the publica
tion of the Anglo- Japanese treaty. This statement may be regarded as setting
forth the views of this Government:
/ ATTITUDE OF UNCLE SAUL
Â» In his circular note of July 8, 1900, to the powers, Secretary Hay announced
as the fundamental principles of the policy of the United States the preservation
of the territorial integrity of China and the maintenance of tha "open door."
The Anglo- Japanese. treaty, supports these principles. Consequently It meets
with. the full approval of the United States. This Government has not been In
vited to become a signatory to the arrangement, nor could It and Its historic
policy adhere to It. :-. V . r. â¢ . . â¢
Count Casslnl, the Russian Ambassador, declined to-night to discuss the treaty
or its effect. upon the policy of this Goverment From the Japanese Minister
The Call correspondent obtained this statement:.
"The. treaty Is not Intended as a menace to any power whatever. It Is fully
in accord with the avowed policies of all the powers, without exception, which
have interests in the Far East. It iÂ« certainly in accord with, the policy of the United
States. It has no reference to the' present convention being negotiated by Russia
with China regarding the evacuation of Manchuria, whatever the effect, direct or
indirect, may be. â¢ It is not aimed at any particular part of China, or any particu
lar power, but is Intended to do just what â¢ it ' saysâ maintain the Independence
and territorial 'integrity, of .China and Korea and preserve equal opportunity for
the trade of all Â¦nations .In those countries."
The refusal of Count Casslnl to discuss tha. treaty v makes it difficult to obtain
Russian views,' but officials here understand that the St. Petersburg authorities
will not permit the treaty to hasten their- action in China.
. ; RUSSIA'S POLICY IN CHINA.
* "'Russia -holds that' she has observed the. most correct policy In China. At tha
beginning of the Boxer outbreak* an attack by the Chinese troops upon her ter
ritory - necessitated the subjugation and occupation , of Manchuria. To prevent
< a recurrence of this attack and to adequately, protect her railroad Russia must
obtain safeguards from; China. The "United ~ States', fully recognizes this fact,
but has. however, protested against the conclusion, of an arrangement between
China and the.Russo-Chinese Bank; under which that Institution is given exclu
sive concessions' in, Manchuria, Germany is a; factor }n the â¢ Manchurian ques
tion, and, her attitude with respect to the treaty is of the utmost importance.
That she will not adhere to the treaty Is at once apparent. Her relations with
Great Britain would not permit such action. Besides, Germany's Interests in
"Shantung are identical with" those of Russia in- Manchuria. It is possible, there
fore, that 1 in case of trouble she would line up with Russia' and France as
against Great Britain and Japan. B@wÂ£9ipQÂ£
- Diplomats in Washington have, not failed to calculate the benefits which the
signatory nations obtain from the' treaty. Great. Britain's -prestige in China has
been considerably affected by her 111 success in Southern Africa. In. case of
trouble she could spare but few troops for, the . Manchurian campaign. Her en
tires;navy;,could;take 1 , part In the conflict, but Its participation would be unim
portant Â¦ unless France â¢' were - to be drawn Into the conflict, as Russia i has only

At one time the copy of the Denver

Bennett, because of trouble with his
wife, had resolved to kill himself. A short
time before he had been discharged from
the Times composing-room. The Tribund,
u. new morning paner, was about to be es
tablished. In brooding over his self-de
struction Bennett remembered his-.treat
ment by the Times and he declared he
would not kill himself until after the new
paper started and then he would do it
in such a way that the Times would get
scooped.' Besides he wanted his death
to be a spectacular one. | Bennett was not
close with this information and at the
headquarters of. the printers in the 'va
rious saloons it was common gossip, this
suicide of Benrtett's. In fact many of the
boys thought the fellow was' only fooling
and did not pay much attention to him.
Monday morning the Tribune was to
appear. All that night Bennett hung
around town 1 - and about 3 --o'clock went
over to 'the Times office to see the paper
on 'the press. As soon as the first paper
was off Bennett rushed out to kill him
self. He knew -the new paper would be
late and in this way he hoped to scoop
the Times on his own death. Across from

SAN JOSE, Feb. 12.â John Bennett, the
printer of Los Angeles, Salt Lake and
Denver, whom a number of San Fran
cisco printers declare resembles the de
scription given of the murderer of. Nora
Fuller, was a peculiar . individual. A
printer of this city who knew "Bennett
well related to a Call reporter a number
of incidents Â¦ connected with the latter's
life. He said Bennett was. partial to the
fair sex and was a great ladies' man.
Besides this he was an accomplished liar
and was at home iii' the midst of all
classes, not because of his likeness to
Ananias, however. That the fellow .was
eccentric and somewhat queer id shown
by the attempt he made to commit sui
cide in Los Angeles in 1SS6.. <
If tbe paper was secured from the as
sembly rooms in the Parrott building it
was done between 'the adjournment of
the convention in the afternoon and the
arrival of the day Janitor at 5 o'clock.
The Janitor is positive he never toolj a
copy of the Denver Post' from the assem
bly room, but gathered up all. the papers
every evening and threw -them into the
chute which conveys the rubbish of the
building to the scavenger's receptacle for
it. The man who hauls the rubbish away
from the Parrott building .to a crematory
says that he never removed a paper from

made to the police yesterday
by John J. Ibbotson, a solicitor, employed
by the Pacific Wine and Spirit Gazette.
He said that six years ago he became ac
quainted with a man named Andrew J.
McPike, a solicitor, residing at 712 Post
strset, and had met him at various times
during the following three years, and that
his description tallied in a remarkable, de
gree with that given of the man who
rented the. premises at 2211 Sutter street
under the name of C. B. Hawkins. He
Â¦Was a man of medium height and had a
peculiar cast in his left eye. â¢ - :
The story was repeated, and, as usual,
it grew In the repetition until Ibbotson
was made to say that the man to whom
he referred had gone under the name of
Bennett and had also told him that he
once adopted the alias of Hawkins on ac-
hands it might have fallen. He- said he
might have left it on a table in a restau
rant or even carried it to ' his rooms at
The Oaks, a hotel on- Third street, near
Mission, but his impression was that he
never took the paper from the assembly
room in the Parrott building, where the
convention was held. Inquiry at The
Oaks Hotel and a careful examination of
the register back as far as December 1
failed to reveal any one stopping there
who answered the description of the man
who rented the Sutter-street house or
any handwriting that resembled his. That
Hawkins Or Bennett secured the paper in
a restaurant is made improbable by' the
statement of F. W. Krone, who says the
murderer took three meals a day in the
Popular "restaurant on Geary ; street.
Hence: he would scarcely eat elsewhere.
Hurlburt "never ate at the Popular res
taurant, and therefore did not .leave the
Denver Post there. ." : ' ' ...
WHAT was thought for a time

velopments in the Fuller miifr
der case was a statement
derer of Nora Fuller, was at work on a
farm in the eastern foothills near Alum
Rock. The information Â¦ was given to the
Sheriff's office by a- farmer living in that
vicinity. Sheriff Langford and Deputy
Starbird at once went out in search of
the man. He was found on the Adams
ranch on the Story road near. Alum Bock
One glimpse of him was enough to sat
isfy the Sheriff he was not- "Bennett "
The suspect gave, his name as Peter Hla
ton. He came from San Francisco two
weeks -ago and secured work on the
Adams ranch. He gave an account of
himself, and besides he did not resemble
Bennett. ;
Any possibility of a. connection between
him and Hawkins or Bennett was de
stroyed by the fact that McPike has not
been in San Francisco for several months
until about ten days ago, when he came
down* from Tuolumne County, where he
has been making his headquarters. He
was in the city on Saturday afternoon, at
which time he was seen by Ibbotson, and
hence arose the suspicion that the mur

McPike has not been seen by any of his
relatives this week and it is supposed he
has returned to Tuolumne County.

Gross banded the money to the head of
the detective bureau with the remark
"That is all I have left of the money I
stole; kindly see that it is given to the
lady I so basely robbed."
Gross was then taken upstairs to the
City Prison and formally charged witn
forgery. . ,
The clever manner In which Gross op
erated gives rise to the opinion that this
was not the first Job of the kind perpe
trated by him. The certificate of .deposit
manipulated by him has been placed in
the hands of an expert photographer and
enlarged negatives were made yesterday
Under, the microscope the erasure made
by Gross is plainly visible, although under
the naked eye the use of chemicals can
not well be discerned. When Attorney
Greany. wrote the order to pay the
amount specified in the certificate to Ann
Klnsella he used a fountain pen. Gross'
handwriting is clumsy and he has a
habit of making, his letters . very laree
On the contrary, Attorney Greany writes
a delicate hand, and when Gross insert
ed his own name in the place of Ann
Kinsella's he sought to imitate Greanv's
handwriting. This he did not succeed well
in doing, but at a casual gRince the Im
posture would not be noticed. The color
of .the ink, however. Is quite different
and clearly indicates that the name of
the payee was inserted at a time other
than that on which the order to nav bv
Greany was .written. *
As the self-confessed, forger resembled
in a general way the description of the
man who met Eleanor Fuller the dav aha
disappeared Captain Seymour sent for
several people who claim to have met her
slayer and asked them if they could iden
tify Gross. After looking at him they all
declared that he was not the man whom
the police know as Bennett or Hawkins.
Accuses Former Tenant of Arson.
SAN JOSE,' Feb. 12.-G. W. Brandt, who
formerly resided on Minnesota avenue
near San San Jose, was arrested in Stock
ton to-day on a charge of arson. The
complainantjs J. C. Arthur, an orchard
iBt, from : whom Brandt rented a house.
The two men had . some trouble and Ar
thur declares Brandt tried to burn the
house after he had vacated it Brandt
will be brought back for trial. . â¢
In view cf the fact that the results of
the investigations of the City Chemist
failed to find any trace of poison in the
murdered girl's stomach, the possession
of cyanide of potassium by Parlane on
December 29 and subsequent thereto does
not assume the importance that it would
have Immediately following the discovery
of the body. At the autopsy the abnor
mal fluidity of the blood of the victim was
noticed, and as this condition may arise
from the administration of poisonous
cyanides particular attention was direct
ed to their detection in the analysis of
the stomach. Assuming the results of
that Investigation to be correct, as they
undoubtedly are, any supposition that an
Illegal use of cyanide of potassium was
made by Parlane is rendered untenable.
LOUIS J. PARLANE. brother Â«>f
the murdered Nora Fuller, on De
cember 29 purchased a quantity
of cyanide of potassium at the
Boulevard Pharmacy, 1198 Fulton
street. He jgave as his reason for want-
Ing the poison that he had a quantity of
silverware to clean. At the same time
he bought a tooth- brush with which to
apply the cyanide to the ware. He told
the clerk he was familiar with the sub
etance, having used it on numerous occa
sions in polishing silverware, and realized
its dangerous nature. He signed the
register which is kept for recording the
tale of deadly poisons, giving his resi
dence as 1514 Fulton street, where Mns.
Fuller lived until after the disappearance
of her daughter.
Parlane does not deny the purchase of
the poison, which he said he used for the
purpose he gave when he bought the
cyanide. He was perfectly frank In dis
cussing the matter. â¢

"Nora assumed charge of the other
children from the home, taking them
back and forth* to school. Except on
those occasions she kept very much to
herself most of tne time and seemed dis
inclined to associate with the other chil
dren.". . . v
"In many respects Nora was different
from most children of her age. For one
thing, she was inordinately fond of read
ing. Fiction of any description was her
delight, and she spent many hours in
tently perusing literature of this descrip
tion when she should have been studying,
v. "Again, . she â¢ displayed : a precocious
knowledge . of the world and its ways,
which at times was astonishing for a
child of her age. She was refined in her
manner, and this I attributed to her
mother's teaching, as Nora had informed
me that Mrs. Fuller taught French and
other accomplishments of like nature for
a living.

hearing . on the' Philippine tariff bill the
session of the Senate to-day was quiet.
The Colorado Senator desired that all

character. He said his recollection was
that Lodge had suggested that the hear

DULUTH, Minn., Feb. 12.-Judge Daniel
A. Dickinson died to-day at his home in
this city after an illness lasting two
years. '.Judge LHckinson -was one of the
general^attorn'eys for the . United States
Steel Corporation, in chrfrge of all the
mining properties of that corporation in
Minnesota. He was born In Vermont in
1839 and was a graduate of Dartmouth
College. He came to Minnesota In 1868,
and from 1875 to 1S81 was Judee of the
Sixth Judiciary District. In 18S1 he be
came Associate Justice of the Supreme
bench of Minnesota and continued as
such until 1894. when he removed from St.
Paul to Duluth.
Daniel A. Dickinson.
Again at 3 o'clock word came that the
status of the case was unchanged, but
that the conditions continued favorable.
At that time, however, no mention was
made as to whether the crisis had been
passed or was near." But after the ex
amination by the doctors to-night Secre
tary Cortelyou said that the crisia in the
right lung, that In the left having passed,
would probably bÂ£ reached to-morrow
night. So confident are the President and
his wife that their, son will pass through
this crisis in good shape, that the Presi
dent is already making preparations to
leave for Washington. .
To-night it* looks as If he might start
some timeÂ» Friday. Every one at the
Gardner House to-night seemd not only
cheerful, but jovial, while Mrs. Roosevelt,
cheered and comforted by a. short but im
pressive service at 6 o clock in the chapel,
went to her nightly watch in the infirmary
in good spirits.
In speaKlng of other things besides the
boys condition, Cortelyou said that no
change had been made in the programme
for Prince Henry's visit; In fact, Invita
tions to the dinner were going out at
Washington. The President will not give
up his trip to Charleston, but will go
there after Prince Henry leaves.
This report, which was given out by
Secretary Cortelyou at 9 o*clock to-night,
was the last of the four Isued during the
day, none of which was of a discouraging
or unfavorable nature. The first came
eariy in the morning and stated that the
night had been a good one and this was
confirmed later, after the morning ex
aminations; by the physicians. In addi
tion, it was said that should, the favor
able conditions continue for forty-eight
hours the danger would be past. . â¢ Â¦ -
To-night he Is considered to be better
than he was last night and the same can
be said of his two schoolmates, Howard
F. Potter of New York and William Gam
mel Jr. of Providence. '
GROTON, Mass., r FebI 12.-W Theodore
Roosevelt Jr. continues for the next
twenty-four hours In his present condi
tion his physicians have given the Presi
dent and Mrs. Roosevelt to believe that
their son's vitality will be sufficient for
him to meet and pass successfully the
crisis in his disease, which Is looked for
some time to-morrow, and on Friday
morning he will be pr-actically out of dan
ser. . ,
ST. LOUIS, Feb. 12.â The Federal offices,

oration of Lincoln's birthday. Patriotic
exercises were held in the various schools
and different societies celebrated the
event appropriately.
BOSTON. Feb. 12.â The anniversary of
Lincoln's birth was observed here to-day
by a liberal display of the national colors.
The feature of the day was the banquet

cluding John D. Long, Secretary of tlye
Navy. \
OMAHA, Feb. 12.â Lincoln's birthday
was celebrated by the Union Pacific Rail
road by closing the entire headquarters
for the day. President Lincoln's admin
istration was especially identified with
the building of the overland road and the
day was observed as much as possible
over the system. The "Lincoln car,"
which now stands dismantled at the old
shops, was draped appropriately and the
employes were given an . opportunity to
view It. The last time the car was used
was to carry the body of the martyred
President to Springfield.
Looklnr back through the vista, of time, I
am inclined to think that the civil war, com
ing as It did, was not altogether a bad thing
for this country. Measured by the amount of
â¢wealth -destroyed by flre and eword and the
quantity of blood spilled on the battlefield the
war was undoubtedly an appalling- calamity.
But measured by the glorious results achieved,
chief amons which* was the settlement of the
slavery question, the war was not an unmixed
evil.
GRAND RAPIDS. Mich., Feb. 12.â Tha
Lincoln Club of this city celebrated the
birthday of Lincoln to-night with a ban

CHICAGO, Feb. 12.â Memorial exercises
In honor of Abraham Lincoln were held
here to-day on a scaie surpassing that of

ercises were held In the schools, all of
the public buildings save the postoffice
were closed, and no business was trans
acted at any of the banks, on the Board
of Trade or on the Stock Exchange.
In the evening there were a number of
banquets, at which the speakers for the
most part dealt with some phase of the
life of Lincoln. The largest of these af
fairs was held in the home of the Har-
Quette Club, where at least seven hundred
members of the club gathered to listen to
addresses. Lafayette Young of Des
Moines; Iowa, spoke on "Abraham Lin
coln." Curtis Guild Jr. of Boston spoke

"Abraham Lincoln," James W. Gleed of
Topeka, Kans.; "A Tribute to McKin
ley."' Senator C. M. Depew; "The Repub

Philippines.
NEW YORK, Feb. 12.â There was a
general suspension of business in the
financial districts of this city .to-day in
honor of the ninety-third anniversary of
the birth of Lincoln. Many mercantile
houses also closed and flags were gen
erally displayed. There were several ban
quets to-night, the principal one being
that of the Republican Club. More than
500 were present in the banquet hall of
the Waldorf-Astoria. President Louis
Stein presided.
The admiral distributed among news
paper men photographs of the Hohenzol
lern and scenes on her decks, taken at dif
ferent times when the Emperor was
aboard, and eIso gave out printed slips
describing the yacht and explaining- the
purposes for which ehe was built and
maintained by the Emperor. The officers
of the Hohenzollern are: Rear Admiral
Count von Baudissin, Captain von Holle
ben; Captain Hipper, navigator; Captain
Lieutenants von der Osten and von Man
tey. First Lieutenants Redensberg. Sled
ensticker and von Haxthausen, Lieuten
ant Elle. First Staff Surgeon Utnemann,
First Engineer Steinmyer, Second Engi
neer Nicolia and Paymaster Heppner.
Admiral Count von Baudissin was for
mally welcomed to New York by a chic
committee, a representative of Mayor
Low and an officer of the United State*
navy. The civic committee was headed
by Captain A. T. llahan. IT. S. X.. re
tired. The admiral thanked the commit
tee and through its members the citizens
of New York. The officers of the Hohen
zollern said that it would be impossible
for them to accept formal entertainments
until the arrival of the Prince, of whose
eu'te they are members.
The Xorth German Lloyd pier at Ho
tooUen, where she is to be overhauled, was
not ready for her reception and she
dropped anchor in midstream until a fleet
of tugs cleared a berth for her. German
flags floated above tiie docks and ware
houses of the North German Lloyd and
Hamburg-American line piers, and the
Fhips of those two companies in , port
v.ere dressed. The bands of the latter
assembled on the quarterdeck "and seren
aded the yacht as she lay at anchor. At
4 o'clock she hove her anchors and, guid
ed by two tugs, was carefully warped
into the pier.
The yacht had some heavy weather In
southern waters, but for the most part
it was fair, and when it was at its best
ehÂ« lodged sixteen knots an hour. She
hove in sight off SaÂ«dy Hook a lew min
utes before the noon hour and an hour
iater was In quarantine. She got the
'courtesy of the port medical officers and
came on through the Narrows and up
fnto North River without delay. Pass
ing craft gave her an enthusiastic wel
come with their' whistles and the man at
her jack?taff was kept busy dipping her
big naval flag with its field of white,
biack Prussian eagle and black cross.
She stood high out of the water and look
t-d impressive beyond her real size. She
is painted white all over, save for a black
eagle at her figurehead, some touches of
pold a?tern and a lone streak of red that
showed below her water line. She has a
ram bow, and in general type resembles
a modern man-of-war.
She "R-as not expected, for she came by
the southern circle, and it was calculated
tl#t the run would take at least one day
more than It did: It had also been
thought that she would touch, at Bermuda
Â«::d that place had reported her as two
days overdue. The weather encountered
v.as unfavorable for a cell at Bermuda.

cbandoned the partly formed plan and
shaped her course for Kew York.

Boys Charged With Burglary.
E. A. Lorenzo, secretary of an improve
ment club, fared badly yesterday at the
hands of Justlco of the Peace Daniels,
who gave judgment against him. for |26 25
on two complaints. The first complaint
was for 510 in favor of Miss Jessie Arenti,'
who worked for Lorenzo. He refused to
pay her two weeks' wages because she
had not given him notice of her intention
to leave her place. Lorenzo was not pres
ent in court, but Judge Daniels sternly
criticized him for trying to evade his Just
obligation. The second judgment was in
favor of Leary Brothers, proprietors of
.the Olympic . stables, who sued for> the
hire of horses, and; buggies rented -.to the
.defendant.
Judge ; Daniels allowed a complaint U
be amended wherein J. H. Â¦ Long, as
guardian of Oscar R. Thayer,- sued the
Union- Iron Works for the value of tools
alleged to have been retained by I the cor
poration. Judge Daniels decided ' that
Thayer himself must bring 1 the suit, and
the Union Iron Works was given twÂ©
days to answer the complaint. '

CLEVELAND, Ohio, Feb. 12.â The Erie
road's vestibuled passenger train, which
left Cleveland at 1 p. m. for New York,
was wrecked between Mahonlng and Pha
lanx, Ohio, about forty miles from this
city, this afternoon. . Â¦
The whole train left the track and ran
on. for twenty car lengths, finally toppling
over Into the ditch. Twenty-one persons
were injured, but none were killed.
The cause of the wreck is said to have
been spreading rails. Most of the injured
were In the coach next to the last. The
rear coach was the private car of Joseph
Ramsay, president of the Wabash Rail
road. His car did not topple over, but the
car in front did. Ramsay was not hurt.
George Thomas of Cleveland received
what are feared to be fatal injuries. Rob
ert S. Blickensderfer, general manager of
the Wabash Railroad, of St. Louis, was
cut about the mouth and his body was
bruised. _
It is urged by the department that every
part of the tree should be sprayed and
that particular attention should be: paid
to the new wood. The work should bo
done after the buds show signs of swell
ing, but should not be delayed long
enough to damage the blossoms.
Take 10 pounds of lime and 20 pounds of sul
phur and boil In 10 gallons of water for from
1% to 2 hours or until the sulphur is com
pletely dissolved. : This will be shown by the
liquid assuming a clear amber color. Slack
the balance of the lime and to It add the salt.
When, this la all dissolved add to the lime and
sulphur Mlutlon. Boll for from 30 to 45 min
utes more. Finally add enough hot water to
make the full 60 gallons and apply to the tree
hot. The efficiency of the lime, salt and sul
phur mixture depends upon the union of the
lime and sulphur' and this result can only be
obtained by thorough boiling. A Bimple mix
ture of materials In useless, as such a mixture
has neither penetrating nor killing power.
For eozne time the agricultural depart
ment of the university has been studying
Into the best method to save the' peach
crop of the State. Warren F. Clarke has
been stationed in Placer County to make
observations and experiments. The sub
stance of the advice of the department to
the owners of valuable peach orchards is
to spray their trees now. This is the
proper time for the spraying, and to delay
Is dangerous. The department also reports
that the proper spray to use consists- of
lime, salt, sulphur and water. This com
pound has proved to be effective if used
at tho proper time. The mixture Is com
pounded of 40 pounds of unslacked lime,
Jfl) pounds of sulphur, 15 pounds of saltand
CO gallons of water. The method of prep
aration is described as follows: Â¦ Â¦
The agricultural department of the Uni
versity of California has issued a bulletin
in which the statement Is made that 25
per cent of the entire peach crop of Cali
fornia is lost every year, and that 20 per
cent of that amount can be easily saved
if the farmers will do the proper thing
to avert the ravages of the peach worm.
The large amount of money invested In
orchards and also in canneries where
peaches form a large part of the stock
that is worked -up, and also the great de
mand there Is In the East for California
fruit, make this matter one of great im
portance.

A PERFECT stranger to local race
goers, the sensational trial of P.
Ryan's Xones over the Burns
handicap distance, one and a
quarter miles, at Ingleside track
on Monday will probably see the Eastern
horse go to the post favorite for the rich
stake, to be decided at Oakland track on
Saturday. Nones Is a son of SIr,Dixon-
Amy Davenport, and Is credited with
ebouldering 123 pounds and covering the
> route in 2:09 over a glow track, made so
by the recent rainfall. Unless some un
foreseen, accident happens - he will be
coupled in the betting with his stable
companion, Obia. Nones was allotted 119
I pounds by the handicapper, and vrill be
ridden by Nash Turner, while Winnie
O'Connor will have the leg up on the Par
dee mare, which will carry 105 pounds.
The remarkable performance was the
talk of turf circles, and it was rumored
last night that the millionaire New York
turfman L. V. Bell may become the own
er of both Nones and Obia before Satur
day. P. Ryan, admitted that he had been
esked to set a price on the pair, and
named $15,000. As first money in "the
Burns" is 57000, many horsemen were In
clined to think a sale would be consum
mated to-day.
The prospective purchaser was one of

the horsemen who witnessed the sensa
tional trial at Ingleside.
P. Ryan offered $2000 yesterday to J. P.
Atkin for Diderot. The horse "is one of

ured to have a good chance on a muddy
track.
FLORENCE, Colo., Feb. 12.â Fifteen
hundred white coal miners met In mails
meeting at the Chandler mines to-day to
discuss the importation of twenty-eight
Japanese by the Victor Fuel Company to
work at the Chandler mines. It was the
sense of the meeting, as expressed by all
the speakers, that the Japanese should be
urged to leave the district, and if they
will not go voluntarily that force should
be used against them.
Before the boycott was ordered there
were from six to eight Chinese restau
rants and about a dozen, laundries. Now
there are only two restaurants conducted
by Celestials, and the number of laun
dries has been reduced materially.- No
violence has been attempted' against the
Chinese so far. '
The hegira of the last ten days is due
to the boycott declared two weeks ago
by the union laboring- men of Silverton,
including the Miners' Union, the Federal
Union and the Cooks' and Waiters' Un
ion.- These unions declared against pa
tronizing either Chinese restaurants or
laundries in Silverton, and their proprie
tors were quietly informed that they
could not remain here. The Chinese aro
not being hurried in their departure, but
it is generally understood that they must
leave this Â¦ cpmmunity within . a reason
able time.
Governor Orman said to-day that he
knew nothing of any trouble at Silverton
until he received Secretary Hay's tele
gram, but he immediately wrote the
Sheriff of Ban Juan County to send him
full particulars of the trouble and to see
that no violence is done the Chinese resi
dents there. Until he hears from the
Sheriff he can take no steps in the matter
further than to assure, the State Depart
ment that he will do all in his power to
protect the foreigners, which he has al
ready done. ,
. A special to xhe Post from Silverton to
day says: Of the fifty 'Chinese who re
sided in Silverton ten days ago twenty
flve remain. The remaining twenty-five.,
it is believed, will depart within the next
week or so. When the last Chinese leaves
the ban against the yellow man will be
strictly enforced, and hereafter no'Mon
golians will be allowed in this district, j
- WASHINGTON, D. C. Feb. Â», 1U02.â His
Excellency, James B. Orman, Governor. Den
ver, Colo.: It is represented that the Chinese
residents, about seventy in number, have been
ordred to leave Silverton under the threat of
violence. An appeal "has been made through
the. Chinese Minister for their protection. Thi
department would be pleased if you would take
such action as you may flnd necessary for the
protection of the rights of person, business and
property. JOHN HAY, Secretary of State.

grave danger of entering the ring' stale
and overtrained. . He is doing . sufficient
work to put Champion Jeffries in condi
tion at a time when he needs rest more
than exercise.
He was boxing for the first time during
his training with Mike Donovan. The
"Kid" â¢ swung at Donovan and the latter,
stepping in, was struck on the head with
Lavigne's arm instead of with his glove.
The wounded boxer did not discover his
Injury for . a moment, but soon found
something had happened.
His brother brought him into town at
once. He consulted a surgeon, who gave
the arm a slight twist,' causing intense
pain, which at once disclosed the seat of
trouble. The arm j was placed under the
X-ray and the broken bone was seen.
The arm will be in splints for some
weeks. This will cause a postponement
of the Lavigne-O'Brien light. This is the
first accident LÂ»avlgne has ever sustained
and the first time he has ever disappoint
ed a club.
George Lavlgne, the crack lightweight
boxer, j broke one of the bones of his left
forearm yesterday afternoon at his train

O'Connor followed this up by taking the
closing six and a half furlong selling af

led to the stretch, where Flamero waded
to the front, winning in a canter from
Tlburon.' , %
jA heavy play sent Colonial Girl to the
post favorite for the fifth event, and in a
drive O'Connor on Shell Mount, a 4% to
1 chance, led her out a neck. Wyoming
disposed of Afghan for the show.
Diderot, another entry for the Burns,
met with better success in' the mile and
a sixteenth selling' number. Ronsch, who
had the mount, 1 made quick play for the
lead with the gelding, and. having only
Galanthus to stall off, scored by a length.
O'Connor, on Duckoy,; the 1 to 2 favorite,
had the misfortune have his saddle
turn, finishing third.
This was the only unusual incident of
an otherwise quiet afternoon's sport. The
track was muddy, but not inclined to be
holding, but the favorites were greatly
out of gear, all. six being massacred.
Seldom does Lee Jackson take matters
too coolly, but it looked very much as if

The first night session of the convention
was given over to .the pioneers, a number
of whom occupied seats on the platform.
Miss Susan B. Anthony presided, and
greetings and addresses from a number
of well-known women were heard. A cor
dial greeting from England's pioneer,
Priscflla â¢ Bright McLaren, -was presented
by Mrs. Florence Fenwlck Miller. A con
tribution on "Educated Suffrage" from
Elizabeth Cady Stanton was read by
Clara Bewick Colby of Washington. A
paper by Carolina Hallowell Miller of
Maryland, who because of illness was un
able to be present, -was read by Mrs. Har
riet Taylor Upton. The paper was entitled
"Why We Come Again," and was an
earnest plea for equal suffrage. The ven
erable Henry B! Blackwell of : Massachu
setts followed with a brief talk on "Equal
Rights to All." Â¦ Â¦ ! â¢
The Rev. Antoinette Brown Blackwell
of ' New York, introduced â¢- as the first
woman ordained to the ministry in this
country, read an interesting paper on
"Chivalry." The Rev. 'Olympla Brown of
Wisconsin gave an Interesting talk on
conditions of "suffrage as existing in the
"United States, paying particular attention
to the privileges which aliens have In ex
ercising, this right and in making the
laws.
A campaigner In the recent New York mu
nicipal campaign pleaded eloquently with the
women to lend their aid. -Said he: "It is the
proud duty of the women of this city to'ad
vise men how to vote, since they have more
time than men to intelligently learn to com
prehend the situation." and every Low follow
er echoed, "true!" But if women are com
petent to teach men how to vote, why may
they not vote themselves? These are the argu
ments the world has put into our moutqs.
Their logic can no more be disputed than
that of the multiplication table. Surely the
world cannot long withstand the force of it.
The president of Stanford University said:
"The function of democracy Is not to make
governments good. It Is to make men strong."
The world approves and adds that that state
ment is the clearest' possible definition of the
difference between the old, when men existed
for the governments, and the new. when gov
ernments exist for men. But we may ask. If
democracy Is a means of making men strong
is there any good reason for keeping women
weak, - that we should deny them the same
chance to grow strong?
Hard upon the track of the man suffrage
movement presses the movement for woman
suffrage, a logical step onward. Why should
woman suffrage not come 7 Men throughout
the world hold their 'suffrage by the guarantee
of the two principles of liberty, and for these
reasons only. One, "Taxation without repre
sentation is tyranny." Who dares deny it?
And are not women taxed? The other, "Gov
ernments derive their Just powers from the
consent of the governed." How simple and
unanswerable that petition of Justice! And are
not women governed?
Mrs. Catt, the president, then delivered
her annual : address, which was listened
to with marked attention. She was fre
quently interrupted by loud and prolonged
applause. In the course of her remarks
she said:
Madame Sofia Levovna Frledland of
Russia responded, saying that Russia had
been the friend of America during the
Civil War and that close ties of friendship
exist between the two countries. America,
she said, had more than once displayed
friendship toward Russia, and had sent
her ships there to protect her people from
a most cruel enemyâ hunger.
The president by a vote of the conven
tion was authorized to appoint the mem
bers of the finance, courtesies and creden
tials committees. She explained that the
resolutions committee must be named by
a vote of the delegates, and this could
be done to-day. The following chairmen
were appointed: Finance, Miss Harriet
Maine Mills of New York; courtesies,
Miss Marie Hay; credentials, Mrs. 1-ar
riet Taylor Upton.
The foreign delegates, who were seated
on the platform and who took great inter

of greeting from May Wright Sewall,

endeavors to permanently occupy Ven

ample assurances that she has no In

dence of her desire to observe the wishes
of the United States she deferred making
a demonstration until the result of the
revolution inausrurated against Castro
could be ascertained. The revolution has
failed and Germany feels that she can

CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
â¢W., WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.â While
without official information the officials
of the State Department would not be
surprised should there be foundation for
the report that Germany has dispatched
men-of-war to La Guira to Insist upon
the payment by the Venezuelan Govern
ment of claims held by her subjects.
It had been expected that Germany
would refrain from making a naval
demonstration in Venezuelan waters un
til the conclusion of the visit of Prince
Henry. There Is a disposition, however,
to attach importance to the fact of the
publication of reports that the ships will
go at once to La Guira simultaneously
with the arrival of the Hohenzollern at
New Tork. The belief apparently prevails
in some circles that Germany will take
advantage of the era of pood feeling
which will exist while the Hohenzollern
is in American waters and Prince Henry
is in this country to force Venezuela to
come to terms. It is pointed out that
there is less likelihood during that time
of the United States misconstruing Ger
man acts.

FDR SUFFRAGE
YOIf OHAMA, Feb. 12.-The \ Premier,
Viscount Katsurat, announced in the Diet
to-day the signing of the Anglo-Japanese,
treaty, which is here regarded as being
practically an Viffensive and defensive al
liance. The Foreign Minister, Kamoura,
made an identical announcement in the
lower house. The news of the signing 'of
the treaty has been received with'enthu
siasm throughout Japan. ; â¢
,: PEKING, Feb. 12,-The . news '.: ol the
Enthusiasm in Japan.
The Neueste Nachrichten sees in the al
liance a far greater practical advantage
for Great Britain than for Japan, "since
a Japanese-Russian war is the most prob
able of all possible conflicts In Eastern
Asia. The paper adds: "It is most unlike
ly that France will actively assist Russia
in such a conflict. Therefore Japan with
the agreement in her pocket, will have to
reckon with one on the costs of settle
ment with Russia." /
The Vossische Zeitung also infers that
the treaty will tend toward the main
tenance of Oriental tranquillity, and says
that it feels to that extent it can be
viewed with satisfaction by Germany.
But the paper adds that Germany's Inter
est in Far Eastern politics is not sufficient
to Justify her offending Russia by par
ticipation in such an agreement.
The most important result will be to give
England greater freedom in the remainder of
the world.
Resembles Triple Alliance.
BERLIN, Feb. 12.â The National Zeitung
referring to the" new' dual 'alliance says:
-The Anglo-Japanese alliance bears a great re.
semblance to the triple aHJance. if the United
States has Joined Japan and Great Britain in
resisting the signing of the Manchurian treaty
it must be inferred that the United States re
gards the new treaty sympathetically. Since
the Immediate aims of Japan and Great Brit
ain are essentially defensive the treaty ac
quires unmistakable significance in regard to
the preservation of peace in the Orient.
The Fracais says:
We think England gets the best of the bar
gain. She merely assumes theoretical obliga
tions toward Japan, whereas the latter'a obli
gations toward England -take a much more
practical character. It does not Beem as if
Japan has much reason to congratulate herself
on the treaty, whilÂ« the other powers cannot
remain Indifferent to an alliance which will
leave England much less accommodating in the
Far East.
The Journal dea Debats remarks:
The new alliance seems to Indicate that the
British Government intends inaugurating a new
policy in the Far East. It- la an innovation
without precedent for a century. England
thereby changes her policy of "free hands"
for a policy of "tied hands." There is perhaps
a direct relation between this and the sort of
diplomatic revolution and change of situation
regarding Wei-Hal- Wei.
The Temps says
PARIS. Feb. 12.â The view taken In dip
lomatic circles here Is that the Anglo-
Japanese alliance, being purely defensive,
is nowise a disquieting element in the
Far Eastern situation. The agreement,
It Is claimed here, excludes Manchuria:
and Russia, therefore, is not menaced
thereby. The alliance is taken to indi
cate that Great Britain has abandoned
her opportunist and vacillating attitude
of recent years in the Far East for a
fixed policy, and that the result will make
for the peace of the world. The question
of Korea, provided for in the first artitcle
of the treaty, cannot lead to a disturb
ance of the peace, because, Russia has no
aggressive aims In that country. Japan
also is not in an aggressive mood. One
of the first results of the alliance will
probably be a new Japanese loan, as
Japan has need of money.
Means New Policy in Far East.
LONDON, Feb. 13.â The Tokio corre
spondent of the Daily Mail asserts the
alliance to be a direct outcome of the tour
of the Japanese statesman, Marquis Ito.
At St. Petersburg, cables the correspond
ent, Marquis Ito sounded the possibility of
an agreement, and certain ratner exacting
clauses in the suggested understanding
were submitted to nim.
The Marquis then proceeded to London
and frankly told the British Government
of Russia's proposals, and intimated that
if Great Britain were disinclined to enter
upon the agreement Japan would lall
back on the Russian offer. These nego
tiations resulted in the arrangement ot a
rough outline of the agreement, and Mar
quis Ito notified Russia of his inability to
accept her proposals.
Baron Hayashi, Japanese Minister at
London, continues the correspondent, then
tooK the matter up and brought the nego
tiations to a successful conclusion.
There is no doubt that the alliance is
very popular in Japan and quotations on
the stock market nave advanced.
Influential Japanese regard the alliance
as a guarantee of peace and as a check
upon Russian ambition. The Japanese
mind is greatly impressed by the strength
and determination Great Britain has dis
played in South Africa, and the best men
of Japan have hoped that the visits or
Marquis Ito would result in a closer union
with Great Britain and with Russia also,
if this is possible. ,_ Â¦
A representative of the Daily Mail in
the lobbies of Parliament has gathered
the opinions of many members of the
House of Commons regarding the alliance
The representative believes that a friendly
understanding with China was obtained
before the treaty was concluded and that
Lord Rosebery is very much pleased with
the treaty. On the whole, says this rep
resentative of the Daily Mail, the mem
bers of the House of Commons approve
this step heartily, but there are many dis
cordant voices on the Liberal side of the
House. Sir Charles Dllke (Radical), John
Burns (Socialist) and others consider the
policy of isolation to be best. Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman, the opposition lead
er in the House, and Sir William Vernon
Harcourt (Liberal) are also dubious ot
the advantages of the alliance, while the
other Liberals look with apprehension
upon what they regard as certain to come,
namely, a conflict between Japan and
Russia. â ,
Among the Government members of the
House and the Conservatives generally
the greatest satisfaction with the alliance
Is expressed, and especially in view of
the fact that it gives Great Britain com
mand of the Japanese fleet.

to bear the burden of war , and Great
Britain's important assistance would bo
the shape of money. Well-informed dip
lomats do not believe, however, that war
will come, as they say Great Britain
knows that immediately upon the declara
tion of hostilities Russia would throw a
huge force into India and quickly obtain
possession of that territory.
It is not doubted among the diplomats
here that the new alliance will effectually
veto the signing of the Manchurian
treaty.
The British Minister, Sir Ernest M.
Satow; the Japanese Minister, Uchida,
and the United States Minister, Mr. Con
ger, have recently been pressing Prince
Chlng to postpone signing the Man
churian treaty, and obtained Â¦ a promise
to defer' so doing until fresh representa
tions could be made, .which representa
tions were made to-day in the form of a
copy of the Anglo-Japanese treaty.
The Chinese officials who were informed
of the signing of the treaty expressed the
greatest satisfaction. They said British
prestige in the Far East had been given
a tremendous advancement.
signing of the Anglo-Japanese treaty of
alliance became known to a few diplo
mats here to-day and was an absolute
surprise. The treaty is regarded as the
most' Important movement made in Far
Eastern politics of recent years. The
Japanese Minister Uchida, visited Prince
Ching, president of the Foreign Office,
and gave him a copy of the treaty. . â¢
The German cruisers Vineta, Falke and

The signer of the foregoing report is
General Manuel A. Matos. the leader of
the Venezuelan revolution and commander
of the Libertador.
When the commander of the Crespo arrived
on board the Libertador we noticed that his
hat had been pierced by bullets, and we ac
knowledged that he and all his crew had

ON BOARD THE LIBERTADOR, off Cuma
rebo, Venezuela, Feb. 7.â We left the vicinity
of Curacao at 4 o'clock this morning, golnj,'
southward. We were Informed by a schooner
that Venezuelan Government warships were
oft La Vela de Coro, and we headed south at
full epeed. At 2 o'clock In the afternoon we
met the steamer Crespo, before Cumarebo, and
the immediately prepared for the fight. To our
summons to surrender, which was accom
panied by a blank cannon shot, the Crespo
replied by opening fire on us, to which the
Libertador answered by directing: the fire of
her heavy guns and rapid tire guns on the
Crespo. The latter kept up firing lor a time,
but her ehells did not strike us, while our
shells inflicted serious damage on her. After
half an hour's fighting, the Crespo hoisted the
white flag and surrendered unconditionally.
The commander of the Crespo, General Pedro
Rivere Sutero, and all her crew, were then
transferred on board the Libertador, and the
Creepo, rendered completely useless, was aban
doned on the coast, after all her war material
had been removed and the guns which we
could not take away had been destroyed. We
then continued our cruise.
The following report of the engagement
between the Libertador and the Crespo
was obtained:
WILLEMSTAD, Island of Curacao, Feb.
12.â A schooner which communicated yes
terday with the revolutionary steamer
LJbertador, confirms the report that the
latter sank the Venezuelan gunboat Gen
eral Crespo recently near Cumarebo. .The
captain and crew of the Crespo are pris
oners on board the Libertador.
MARTINEZ, Feb. 12.â Andrew Crandall
was shot and killed by Dr. Ryder Powell
this afternoon on what is known, as the
Quicksilver Mine ranch, three miles from
Clayton. A man named Bendixon escaped
the same, fate only because of the, de
fective aim of 'the shooter.. Dr. Powell is
80 years of age and has been a resident of
the Clayton . district for -the past thirty
Â¦years. ; :Â¦ ! ,Â¦ . '..-.... .'_â¢'.' .:...'
For some years a portion of $he Quick
silver Mine ranch has ' been in litigation.
Dr. Powell claimed about 1200 acres of
Government land, while Crandall .and
Bendixon laid claim to a quarter section
of the property, which is supposed to.con
tain a quicksilver deposit. This .quarter
section was ; inclosed with a â¢ fence by
Powell and he had warned the rival claim
ants to keep off, the land. Â¦'Â» \ ''. Â¦
Crandall and Bendixon this afternoon at
tempted to pass through a gate of the
fence and visit the quicksilver . deposit.
Dr. Powell was there to stop them.
"If you attempt to â¢ trespass upon . my
land I will kill 1 you," he declared.
The two menj thrust him aside and con
tinued on through the gate., 'Suddenly the
octogenarian drew a pistol and fired twice
at Crandall, Who was only a few feet
away. Crandall fell dead In his tracks.
Dr.' Powell then turned his weapon upon
Bendixon and fired, but the bullet did not
take effect. Without waiting to learn
what disposition was made of his victim's
body, he mounted a horse and .rode into
Martinez andi gave himself up to the
Sheriff. â¢ ;
In his statement to the Sheriff Dr.
Powell alleged that he killed Crandall in
self-defense. He says that he, with Frank
Silvey and Thomas Prein, went out to re
pair the fence, which was about a quarter
of a mile from his house. While they
were at work Crandall and Bendixon rode
up and attempted to enter the lnclosure.
He warned them away and a quarrel
started. Dr. Powell itlleges that the two
men seized him, but that he succeeded in
getting out of their clutches. Then, be
lieving that his life was in danger, he
took from a sack near at hand- a revolver
that he had brought along to defend him
self with and opened fire. He does not
know whether the first shot took effect,
but when he fired the second time Cran
dall fell. S
Dr. Powell, whose years have rendered
him feeble, has long been regarded as a
crusty and excitable old man. For years
he has been mixed in land quarrels, hold
ing .to the property he claimed, despite
the efforts of others to develop a portion
of the land as a mineral claim.

"Why, I had no Idea your store

tion, and we have an -offer to make.
Here it is:
TO ANY ONE WHO WILL
VISIT OUR STORE TO-MOR-

WE WILL GIVE A PIECE OF
SHEET MUSIC. â¢ *
The reason we' do this is because
we want ; every one to know â
FIRST, that the House of Curtaz
carries the largest stock of pianos
on the Coastâ that this stock occu-
pies five floors and is more varied
than any stock you have ever seen.
SECOND, that the prices quoted
by the House of Curtaz are j lower
than any others in San Francisco..
THIRD, that the pianos here are
.instruments of merit, of permanent!
worth, perfect in every detail of the
piano maker's art, and guaranteed
by a guarantee that is worth some-
thing.
FOURTH, that we are practical 1
piano makers â that we can explain
the MECHANICAL parts of an in-
strument, and that we can enlighten
you so that no matter where i you
buy, you can buy, intelligent^.
'-" FIFTH, that our record as piano
dealers in. San Francisco for the past
45 years is a matter to consider, .and
that there is little safety in buying
where a guarantee is worthless.
These are all points of 'vital ; con-
sequenceâ think them over.

NEW. YORK, Feb. 12.-The following
Calif ornians have arrived at the hotels:
Calif ornians in New York.
It will be perceived the issue is a subtle one. The
statesmen fulfilled their agreement by granting the
franchise, but the railway wished a valuable consid
eration for its money, and the franchise granted is of
no value whatever. How Jhe courts will decide we
cannot undertake to say, but it would seem to be a
case where they would: be justified in sending bothJ
parties to jail and holding them there, while the case
is taken under advisement for a series of years. Â¦
It appears from the story as it comes to us that
the St. Louis and Suburban Railway Company de
tired a franchise for an' extension of its lines, and
in order tc avoid trouble it agreed to put up $135,
coo for distribution among certain influential parties
when the franchise was granted. The story goe v s on
to say. the money was placed in safe deposit boxes'
with double locks and a key to one of the locks was
held by each of the two parties to the agreement.
As the money could not be reached until both locks
were opened neither side could get at it without the
co-operation of the other. That matter having been 1
duly arranged the municipal ;council found that, the
grant of the franchise would-be to the advantage;
of the public and proceeded .to" grant it in due fornv
Somebody took objection to it, -however, and 'the
case was carried into the courts, and there the fran-_
chise was declared to be illegal.
â¢Upon that showing the question arises: To whomv
doe's the money in the safe deposit belong?' The mu
nicipal statesmen claim it because they carried out
their agreement and granted the franchise. The rail
way corporation claims it because the franchise be
ing illegal is of no value. Neither party can get.at
the money. The railway men found that they, were
out $i3S,coo.- The position is awkward, but after'
meditating on the subject the corporation decided to
appeal to the courts to compel the statesmen to un
lock the safe and give up the cash. Thus theissue
has been raised, and it is now incumbent on the
Judges to; decide on which side justice lies.
FROM St. Louis comes a story of a political
deal and a lawsuit which promises to give the
courts one of the nicest points for decision that
ever was submitted to a judicial tribunal. The point,
moreover, is one of importance, for it involves such
material property as the sum of $135,000 in cash,
and such moral questions as whether or no a cor
poration is bound to keep its pledge to municipal
statesmen when the statesmen have done the best
they can to keep faith with the corporation.
A ST. LOUIS IMBROGLIO.
In explanation of that condition of affairs the Post
master General points out that the stimulus of cheap
paper, and nominal, postage has led to the publication
of fake journals, which are run mainly for advertising
purposes. While legitimate journals maintain a large
staff of workers and expend vast sums -for news or
for literary and scientific .contributions, the fake
journals do nothing of the kind. : They have no news
service and no contributors. Their only expense Â¦ is
One of the serious evils resulting from the tolera
tion of these. abuses is that it makes the Government
a partner of fake publications in opposition to legiti
mate periodicals. The report says: "The extent of .
the complicity of the Government in these purely pri
vate enterprises is not generally realized. The state
ment will probably be surprising that in the case of
hundreds of such publications wherever the publisher.
spends $1006 on his venture the Government spends'
not less than $2000 in carrying on that publisher's
business, and wherever he puts v $ioo,ooo into its run
ning expenses the Government puts in not less than
Figures are given by the Postmaster General
showing that the Government at the close of the last
fiscal year was carrying an aggregate of 200,000,000
pounds of mail at one cent a pound which should
cither pay the third class rate, equal to eight cents
a pound, or not be carried at all. In that vast amount
of mail matter legitimate publications, for whose
benefit the second cla.ss rates were established by
Congress, are not included. It is made up of pub
lications whose existence is due to the fact that the
Government circulates them for less than the cost.
The report says: "Not counting the expense - of
handling, it costs the Government $10,000,000 a year
to transport this matter. It returns in ; postage
$2,000,000 a year,. thus involving a direct" loss on
transportation alone of $8,000,000. If it be charged
with its fair share of the total cost of the mail ser
vice, on the very conservative calculation, heretofore
given, the loss to the Government is not less than
$12,000,000. That amount is three times the postal
deficit of the last fiscal year.'V ',
BY way of giving the public a fuller understand
ing of the extent to which the second class
- mail privilege has been abused by unscru
pulous parties that portion of the Postmaster Gen
eral's report for 1901 which deals with the matter has
been republished in pamphlet form by the Govern
ment for general circulation. The facts therein pre-.
sented fully justify the action of the Postoffice De
partment in excluding from second class privileges
the fake journals that were virtually living upon the
Government and reveal the need of further exclu
sions. It is not likely that the Postmaster General
can under the existing law put an end to the whole of
the abuse, and it is therefore the duty of Congress to
undertake the work by a thorough revision of the
postal laws. *f-

This beats all the ante and post Christian miracles.
Krishna, Zoroaster and Buddha could, not draw
crowds enough to pay their license as conjurers with
Sabin on the road. The X-ray is the pale glimmer
of a tallow dip compared with this, and Professor
Pearson must descend from his high horse and repent
fvhile there is time or Sabin may prick him for the
simples at long range. -'-V^
Observe, too, that Colonel Sabin did not select
salt rheum or soft corns, scald head or colic to oper
tte on in this test case. The cable brought hirnT an
Incurable cancer from Natal, a difficult disease and a
difficult distance. Cancer is a scourge of civilization.
It is the odium of tile medical profession. It is in
form a perfect rose, that grows in the flesh which it
consumes. Its ravages increase yearly. It attacks
the angles of the exterior body and the external
glands. It takes a bfte of the liver without bacon,
and placards itself on the walls of the stomach, which
become dead walls at once. It gouges out the eyes,
and never fights fair. But Colonel Sabin knocks it
cut as a breakfast spell, across 15,000 miles of land
&nd water, in twenty-four hours, .not accounting for
longitude and difference in time!
Where is Marconi now? Where the dog-Latin
prescriptions of the doctors? Where, indctd, the
miracles of the Bible, which were performed in im
mediate contact, compared to this antipodal wonder,
worked over a space of 15,000 miles?
But to return to Colonel Sabin. His statements
are calculated to make Professor Pearson take the
back track in his treatment of the scriptural miracles,
for Sabin makes them look like thirty cents. He de-.
dares that religion must rest on proof that it can
heal the sick, and that he has the divine gift and will
impart it to others. He asserts that "faith can con
trol the elements." This is an old doctrine that was
for centuries held by the Christian church, and still
reappears in invocations for Tain. Even the church,
however, puts up Franklin's lightning-rod in thunder
storm countries, and where it freezes banks up the
:ellar in the fall to save apples and potatoes from
frost. No manifestation of faith has yet removed a
lertical sun from the tropics and made it thaw ice at
Lhc poles. But Colonel Sabin does not stop at asser
tion. Whatever he :s he is not a vague and abstract
person. He is concrete, crystallized and cubic. In
his addresses he tells this: "Many months ago a
cablegram came to me in this cotmtry asking me to
give absent treatment to an incurable cancer afflict
ing a woman in Natal, South Africa. I began the
treatment at once, and the very day after the message
was sent the cancer utterly vanished and the patient
recovered." I
IX one of the large Eastern cities Colonel Sabin
recently lectured in behalf of Reformed Chris
tian Science. There is no desire to dispute the
influence upon the human mind of Mrs. Eddy's cult.
It is still young, but has furnished come-outers al
ready, and the reformed branch is in the field. This
is according to nature. Six hundred years after Ma
homet Omar Khayyam found occasion to poke philor
iophical and poetic frn at the two and seventy sects
into which his creed had laminated. Prior to the
Council of Nicea Arius and Athanasius had reached
the parting of the ways in the history of Christianity,
and now the sectaries are numerous, active and no
doubt all doing some good. *

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
Such are some of the conclusions of the commis
sion's woik. It may be that Congress will give heed
to them, but that, is doubtful. The report' has two
defects â it is too long and it scatters too much.
Turning" to, tariff questions the commission recom
mends that whatever changes may be made in the
tariff by reciprocity or otherwise adequate protection
to the beet sugar industry be maintained. Then it
makes a jump to the subject of highway improvement
and urges that increased appropriations be made by
Congress for building sample stretches of improved
roads in various sections of the country so as to en
courage the more. rapid construction of such roads at
State and local expense. Next it gives attention to
the postoffice and recommends the extension of the
free rural delivery/system, and then advocates the ex
tension di the present policy of protecting the forest
reserves, and the consolidation of the thred bureaus
of the Government which have charge of investiga
tions and administrative work in connection with
forestry. ,-.._- . 'Â¦... ;. . c Â¦. ; .r:. : -
It may be remembered that;this commission was.
appointed to inquire into the adulterations and sale
of articles of food,. and that popular interest in its
earlier, investigations was mainly due to the testimony
which was brought out on that subject. It is pleasing
'to know that the commission did not wholly overlook
that phase of its work. Among' other recommenda- .
tions it urges that a pure food section'in the chem
istry division of the Department of Agriculture be
established to prevent the adulteration, false brand
ing and deceptive imitation of foods, beverages, can
dies, drugs and condiments in the District of Colum
bia and the Territories, and for regulating interstate:
traffic therein.
Passing from commerce to -agriculture the com
mission recommends that, the Secretary of Agridul
ture be given authority to inspect dairy products in
tended for export, to fix standards for cereals when
intended. for export, to cause stock yards and stock
cars to be cleansedj to ; ; prevent 'the export of diseased
meats from one State to another or to foreign coun
tries, .and that a law be provided for the inspection
of nursery stock intended for interstate commerce or
for export. â¢'-*'.'â¢
A strong support is given to the claims of the Inter
state Commerce Commission for greater power, in
dealing with violations of laws enacted' for the pur
pose of regulating, commerce. Upon that, subject
the commission recommends: ."The definite 'grant of
power to the' Interstate Commerce Commission,
never on its own initiative, but-only on formal com
plaint, to pass upon- the reasonableness of freight and
passenger rates or charges; also the definite 'grant of
power to declare given rates unreasonable, as at pres
ent, together with power to prescribe reasonable
rates in substitution." Another reconfmendation f is
the establishment of a permanent corps of expert
auditors, who : shall. have authority under the super
vision of the Interstate Commerce Commission to
examine periodically the accounts of all railroad
companies, whether operating or financial in their, na
ture; that violations of the act respecting the keep
ing andvfiling of annual reports by carriers be made
misdemeanors, and promptness in making such re
turns .be required.
AFTER its prolonged sessions and searching?
the Industrial Commission, of which the coun
try, heard so much at one time, has filed its
report. It has done justice to the magnitude of its
work by extending the report to the proportions of
a volume of iooo pages, arid has. included within it
recommendations 'upon- well nigh" every subject of
legislative interest except "woman's suffrage and the
adoption of a national marriage law.'

It is time for the War Department to keep its
hands* out of civil legislation. The Secretary of the
Treasury is the officer intended by the constitution to
advise in revenue matters, and when an impost or an
excise tax affects American agriculture the Secretary
of Agriculture is to be sought for council.
Let us have less wood-root for a while.
It is now evident that Root and Wood are trying
to induce Congress to make good Root's pernicious
and deceptive pledge.
This incident is explanatory. It reveals the reason
for the close rhetorical partnership between Root and
General r ood. Root made a promise h,e had no
right to make, a pledge he had no power to perform.
Under the circumstances it was a despicable trick
played upon Capote to sugarcoat the Platt pill. Of
course it may be said that the Cuban delegates should
have known that the Secretary had no right to make,
such a promise and no power to redeem it. But they
did not know this, and went back deliberately de
ceived to advise action by their people procured by
a device unworthy a member of the 'American Cabi
net.
Republican Senators are incensed by his impudence
and by some revelations incident to its latest mani
festation. Our readers will remember that Congress
passed the Platt amendment to the Cuban enabling
act, which established our suzerainty of the island in
international matters. The Cuban constitutional
convention resented that amendment and sent Senor
Capote and others to Washington to try and; effect
its repeal. Instead of succeeding in that they re
turned to Havana advocates of- its adoption. It is
now revealed that on visiting Secretary of Wa- Root
they were promised ty him positively that if the
Platt amendment were, accepted he would give them
free trade for sugar, tobacco and fruits! Upon that
pledge they changed, end so declare now.
When it i* assumed that an officer of the army can
dictate to Congress, ot even be permitted to criticize
its acts of omission or commission, it is time to ad
minister a lesson that will be remembered.
General Wood's zeal in behalf of Cuban free trade
is like unto that of a planter or a planter's attorney.
He made one special pilgrimage to Washington to
advocate it, and did so with an air offensively dic
tatorial, and now he has addressed a letter to the
United States Senate,. in his official capacity, enjoin
ing it to obey his instructions. The constitution
makes it the <!uty of the President of the United
States to communicate to Congress the state of the
Union.' There is.no si'ch authority given to any sub
ordinate officer of the Government, either civil or
military. But a little thing like the constiVition does
not stand in General Wood's way at all. He has
ruled Cuba so long that he fancies that his jurisdic
tion as dictator has spread over the mainland. ;
Other officers of less rank were not less rank in
their offending against the decencies of their posi
tion. The idea which possessed them seemed to be
that civilians, including members of Congress, were
expected to obey without question such orders as is
sue from military headquarters. Time was that the
militarism of Germany went no further than Wood
and his officers have gone. But that was the green
stick. In the dry, a German officer shot down a
laborer, killing him on the street, because, carrying
a heavy burden, the workingman had unintentionally
rubbed against his uniform! The murderer went un-
THE CALL was the only paper in the United
States that called attention to the extraordinary
course of General Wood, Military Governor of
Cuba, and a number of other army officers on duty
in that island, who were volunteering, not advice, but
dictation, to Congress as to its procedure in a matter
of economic and not military legislation. General
Wood's original statement of the case was in the
highest. degree impudent, officious and offensive. He'
put it in such form. as to make it accusative of all op
position as. dishonest, dishonorable and unpatriotic.

By the grace of the Board of Public
Works a wooden sidewalk is at last being
constructed along the skirt of the sea of
mud which for many years has covered
Spear street between Harrison and Bry
ant. In order to lay, the foundations for
the new elevated road it waa necessary
to dig a pathway the width and lengtn
of the new sidewalk. It was discovered
to the general surprise of people that
have for years been wading through this
section of the water front that the road
way had a solid wooden foundation. The
new sidewalk will add considerably to the
comfort of pedestrlana. Its construction
even at this late date Is looked upon as
a blessing and a tribute to the persuasive
powers of the Santa Fe Company, at
whose request it is being constructed.
When* this improvement is completed it
is expected that a similar pathway will
be constructed along, tho roadway lined
by the grain sheds on the seawall, which
ip wet weather ' Is almost equally im
passable for pedestrians.

Pilot George D. Korts' flying leap for the
steamship Alameda made on Tuesday aft
ernoon from a cockle shell dingy in a
heavy sea has established a record which
pilots of the future will find it hard to
beat. Apart from the danger, which a
good pilot never considers, the perform
ance was something of a gymnastic feat.
A pilot schooner's dingy is not the most
stable starting place for a flying leap.
A dingy in quiet water is an unstable
craft, but in a heavy sea offers about as
elusive a foothold as the imagination can
suggest. Then a Jacob's ladder is not
just like an ordinary stairway. It is not
even an ordinary ladder. To the novice
the trip on a Jacob's ladder over the side
of an ocean liner lying quietly alongside
a dock would be about as impossible a
feat as the ascension of a greased pole:
When Korts boarded the Alameda she
was pitching like a wild horse. One mo
ment the ladder would be plastered hard
and fast against the steel sides of the ves
sel. Â»A lurch, and out over the boiling
sea would swing the thing of rope and
slippery slats. Then bang against the
side. And this to the accompaniment o*
drenching spray. AVhen Korts jumped
the steamship was crashing through the.
seas at the rate of six or seven Wiots
and the waves were playing shuttlecock
and battledoor with the dingy from
which he leaped. Captain Hernman on
the . Alameda' s bridge gave the signal
"stop her" at 3:21 p. m. He expected to
slow down, and in view of the state of
the weather looked forward to quite a
wait before the pilot caught the ladder.
The steamship had hardly, lost any head
way, however, when out " of the foam
alongside darted the dingy, and before
any on board realized what had happen
ed the smiling face of Korts appeared
above the bulwarks. At exactly 3:22 the
engine room telegraph tapped out the or
der, "full speed ahead."
Korts' Flying Leap Is a Fvscord.

their married life has been an unnappy
one. She says that In June. 1901. wniie
they were living at Oakland, Cailinan
struck her repeatedly with his fists,
pinched her black and blue and then
choked her into insensibility. 3he says
that he made it a common practice to beat
her unmercifully and cites as an Instance
of his brutality a beating and choking he
administered to her on December 20 last
â¢Mrs. Cailinan asks for a divorce and for
$150 per month alimony.
Cailinan is the leader of the Columbia
Theater orchestra. He was secretly mar
ried to the woman who is now suing him
for divorce at San Jose, December 2b. 1900.
His friends and acquaintances did not
know that he had become a benedict until
a few days ago, when Mrs. Cailinan.
piqued because of a quarrel she had had
with her husband, announced that the
ceremony had taken place.

the old adage "marry in haste and repent
at leisure" has been exemplified "many

shoals that threaten the matrimonial
bark. The latest of these uphappy couples
are Mr. and Mrs. William C. Caillrian, the
story of whose secret wedding at San
Jose a little more than a year ago was

otherwise treating her in a cruei and in

VASELINE NO GOOD FOB HAIR
Dandruff Germ Thrives in It; as Weil
as in All Grease;
A well-known Chicago hair specialist in-
vited the Inter Ocean reporter to come to
his office and see, under a microscope,
how the germ that causes dandruff
thrives in vaseline. The specialist said
that all hair preparations containing
grease simply furnish food for the germs
and help to propagate them. The only-
way to cure dandruff !s to destroy the
germs, and the only hair preparation that
will do that is Newbro's Herplcide. "De-
stroy the cause, you remove the effect."
"Without dandruff no falling hair, no bald-
ness. Ask for Herplcide. It 13 the only
destroyer of the dandruff germ.

A New Discovery Wnicli Cupss
. All Forms of Catarrh.
The tablet is thÂ« Ideal form In which to ad-
minister medicine, but until recently no suc-
cessful catarrh tablet had ever been attempted.
There is now.l however, an excellent and pala-
table remedy for catarrh In tablet form, known
es Stuart's Cfttarrh Tablets and sold by drug-
gists, composed of the most recent discoveries
In medicine for cure of catarrh, and results
from their use have been highly gratifying:.
The old time treatment of catarrh was In
the form of inhalers, washes, douches, sprays,
etc. Later", on internal remedies were used
with greater cuccess. but being in liquid or
powder form were inconvenient to use and like
all medicines. In liquid or powder form lose
their medicinal properties when opened or "ex-
posed to the air. \
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets contain highly con-
centrated antiseptics, Red Gum, Blood Root,
etc., which kill the catarrh germs in the blood
and mucous membrane, and in this respect are
strictly scientific and modern, because all au-
thorities are now agreed that catarrh Is a con-
stitutional blood disease, and local applications
can have only* a transitory effect. -
The use of inhalers,' douches and sprays Is a
nuisance and inconvenience and can in no wise
compare favorably with the same antislptlcs
given in tablet form Internally, where they can
reach, the stomach and blood and kill catarrh
germs right where they are produced.
A prominent lawyer and public speaker of
Pittsburg says: "I have been â¢ troubled with
catarrh of the head and I throat for twelve
years.' In this climate It seems impossible to
get rid of it. The continual dropping of mucus
from the nose into the throat caused irritation
and hoarseness, " seriously Interfering with my
public speaking. It took me an hour or more
of coughing, gagging, expectorating and sneez-
ing everv^morning before I could settle down
to workr and this condition gradually brought
on catarrh of stomach, causing loss of - appe-
tite, poor digestion Â« and , a foul â¢ breath; which
annoyed me: exceedingly.'. My i- physician ad-
vised me to try ; Stuart's Catarrh Tablets and
I took them, for- two months and was aston-
ished - to find how j quickly they cleared : my
head, throatl and stomach, and I have no hesi-
tation in recommending them. They are not
only plÂ«asant to take.. but they, seem to get at
the very root of -.' the trouble,', because since
using them I have had no trace of catarrh.'.' .
Druggists cell Stuart's Catarrh Tablets at 60
cents for full sized package. * .
They'can'be carried In the pocket and used
any time and as often as. desired, since, they
contain " no cocaine, mercury or any other in-
jurious .'drug.

The Trade Outlook.
A ::KW YORK BANKER THINKS THAT
THE HIGH-WATER MARK HAS
BEEN REACHED.
The New Tcrk circular of Henry Clews cays:
"Aincng those who hold the buik of the
floating supply of stocks, the opinion is de
< iCedly bullish, and in such quarters very
j-oeitive predictions of higher prices are cur
jent. In other circles, however, a decidedly
conservative tone exists. "With many the old
arcujnent that prices are already as high as
conJliicns Juttify is still a potent one. It is
worthy of note t'.iat bank clearings and rail
road earnings;, though very satisfactory, are
shoving steadily falling increases. The iron
trrid* is Just bow the only business exhibiting
any phenomenal activity; -and the demand lor
lien beias special and abnormal that industry
cannst at tn:s tir.io be deemed a fair trade
barometer. The grain movement at interior
points is ruiming nearly 50 per cent below
la::t year, ar.d <-ctton receipts have begun to
decrease also, t-hrrt crops of corn a.nd cotton
Â«i'-e at last beginning to show their effect, not
c:ily upen ra:!rcad traffic, but also upon the
t reign exchange market; the consequent scarc
ity of commercial bills being the chief incen
t ve for shipp'.rs over $4,000,000 gold this week.
. much mors careful feeling is noticed in mer
* .mtile circles, v.here high prices on mer
Â« iiandise are beginning to show their effect in
1 sscned sale: and diminished consumption.
3 is no Occasion to believe that the end
c'. good tiÂ«nos is at hand; but here and there
* <;n;8 of having touched high-water mark are
Su'.iltipiytat, and it is beginning clear that ac
t vlty can t.n;y b2 continued by. bringing prices
<jjwn to a more reasonable Ie\*d.. We are now
f.yproaching the dull trade season, and during
tlie next 6ix months much will depend upon
t.ie crop outlcck. I'armers are prosperous as
Â» class; they htve epent freely, and the same
1? t-ue in the mir.eral 'industries, which are
yearly becoming more imj>crtant factors in our
E liir.s.! prosperity.
"The general situation, however, is satlsfac
tOT. 'If the country eeeais disposed to take
a period for rest and reflection after its recent
activities, that may be regarded with satis
faction. " General conditions are sound: credit
it not overstrained, and there ie va^tiy more
prudence in regard to new end untried enter-
Tf ites - than vras the case a year ago. Som*
rrther severe lessens have been learned with
advantage during thp.t interval. As a result
thÂ« present undertone of the stock market
If distinctly stronger. : and there is more con
f5 ience in thÂ« future. Easy money )s a pow
erful aid to manipulation, and moderate rates
sÂ«Â»e!n Jik*-ly until pr<?paiatlons for April, set
tletner.ts pro in order. Further shipments of
gold nay bÂ« expected and the reduction in thy
Bank of England rate suggest* that London
If confident of shifting any European demand
fcr cold upr-n New York. The foreign situation
er-ows distinct improvement. I^ondon boing
ir.nro hopeful In censr-qaence of progress in
F<uth Africa and Berlin showing a partial
revival resulting t>r:m the safe passing of a
wloiip ln<iuf-tÂ»-!ri orifls. A favorable feature
In home aTairs is the prospective abolition of
tb9 internal revemie war taxes, which caufpd
ccr.pe*tion of funds In the treasury, were be
coming a eeriouji menace to the money market
nnd constituted the darkest cloud overhanging
the business situation. This danger, it is hoped
u-in Â«oon be remevpd. Therefore all thlng3
ccrsidrred the local situation is becoming more
favorable to upward manipulation. It is nÂ«t
altogether surprising that appearances Indi
cate that a strong concerted effort is being
mnde to lift th" matkPt out of its recent rut
C< r.sequ^ntly th<? market hereafter will offer
better op'u-tunitities for quick trading, but I
advise taking all moderate profits rather than
bo! "ling out fcr very b!g ones."

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
At the Orange auction yesterday 6 cars were
offered, but 1 car of fancy fruit was withdrawn,
as the bidding- toward the end of the sale be
came rather slow, owing to the fact that the
buyers were already well supplied. Five cars
were sold at the following prices: Fancy
Navels. $2 10@2 65 i choice do. 80c@$l C5;
standard do, 50c@$l 25. A small lot of fancy
Lemons sold from ?1 60 to $2 05 per .box. In
the open market conditions remain unchanged,
with large sizes of fancy Navels held firmly,
as considerable shipping Is expected on the
Honolulu steamer, out Saturday.
A small consignment of Strawberries, con
sisting of 30 small baskets, arrived from Santa
Barbara and were offering at 30@40c per bas
ket.
The Honolulu steamer arrived with 6205
bunches Bananas and 20 cases Pineapples.
The Bananas- were mostly green and will be
stored In the cellars. Ripe Bananas are rather
scarce at present and New Orleans are quoted
higher. \

The Hay Market.
The private circular of Somera & Co. says
cf Hay:
""The much needed showers of a. week ago
had the tendency to stimulate shipments of
Hoy to the Stri Francisco market with the
n-Kult that the receipts for the past six days
amount to 2800 tons or 800 tons more than for
the week preceding. 'With these comparatively
heavy shipments and with the continuous
*^hÂ«/v.Â«r= during the week the market was con-
EiiZtrpiiiy weakened and prices which had ad
vanced from sl to ?2 per ton seem at the
present writing almost back to the old range,
perhajis Soc per ton higher right through.
â¢â¢Although v.-<? contend that the Hay market
is not a v.eather market, for even should the
gmia crop jjro^-e a. failure we will without
doubt have a Hay crop next season, yet buy
aa are continually watching the sky, and with
? vary evidence of rain become less confident
j rr the situation. With us the future of the
in/srket for the balance of this season is purely
a rr.atter of country supply, and although the
T\-ta.Uier influences may be predominant at the
monier.t, yci the other matter is sure to pre
vail later..
"The season thus far is surely a most pe
cu'lcr one. ThÂ« grain prospects north of us
are reported better than for several seasons at
this period, -whereas in the southern districts
thi situation is much less promising. Frosts
have done some damage to green feed in the
touth. and there Is much grain sown six weekb
ago that Â¦ is not yet up. To summarize we
would say that although in many districts the
Eitiu.Upn is not very promising, yet If our or
dinary rains tone later the State should have
a bountiful croiÂ»."

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Receipts of Eggs were again extremely
heavy, as will be seen below, and stocks
showed signs of accumulation; though they
have not yet reached that point. Dealers are
shading the quotations to sell, but there is
not much demand for shipment and the local
demand has mainly to be depended upon in
consequence. Quotations are not yet lower, but
will socn be at the present rate.
There is a very good demand for the cheaper
grades of Butter, which are now easier to sell
than the fancy creameries. Prices ate steady.

Dried Fruits in New York.
Mail reports from New York say
"Coast confirmation of the sale by the Cured
Fruit Apociation of the balance of its holdings
of oid prunes, coupled with reports from re
liable quarters that stocks in first hands of
l>oth old and new fruit are in strong control
stimulated a little steadier feeling in the article
here, fclpot slocks are, however, believed to
be ample. ar.Â£ no material advance in values is
reported. There is n. somewhat better inquiry
noted from interior points, and on strictly new
tznu Clara stock little shading; is possible
from present values with 0 s ic basis quoted by
most holders on 4O-50s in 25-lb boxes. Some
poorer grades are offered lower and old fruit
Is available, according to holder, from hie tj
%e less. Offerings of old Santa Claras from
thÂ«: coast are availabls at ilc. four-size baais..
find eld VJsalias on the 2%c four-size basts;
this price, it is stated, holding on the 200
carload purchase reported yesterday. In cur
rants the feeling remains steady, but no im
portant buying interest is noted. Holders
quote from 5'^c to 5^Â»c on fine Amalias un
oleaned in barrels, and pne or two inquiries
under the ideas of holders here. In raisins
the interest is quiet, but the feeling continues
fairly firm, with SV*c to S&c quoted on cartons,
choice and fancy seeded. Two-crown loose is
steady, but on three-crown loose the market
is firm at Ctic. Xo "buying from the coafct
on the new f. o. b. basis is reported. In
aprirots and peaches there is more Inquiry
noted. Seme business in extra fancy Muir
and Crawford peaches is possible at 10>4c
?pot. The feeling throughout the list is show
ing firmnoKS. In dates no Important business
is reported. Persians are steady and Fards
Ehcw easiness. In fie? there Is noted a fair
buying interest for both layers and bags. We
note the arrival ex Toronto, from Hull, of
C<22 bags. In nuts the demand is quiet and
th*Â» feeling bhows some easiness in fruit in

WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.â The memorial
of the Federal party of the Philippine
Islands : was transmitted to the Senate
this afternoon by the Secretary of War,
together with a letter of transmittal by
Governor Taft, in whose charge the docu
ment was sriven.
,The memorial was adopted at an ex
traordinary session of the Federal party
held in Manila in November. -It sets
forth that, the performance of that obli
gation of the treaty of Paris which gave
the United States Congress authority to
fix the status of the Philippine Islands
has been deferred to this time because
of the attack by the Filipinos upon ' the
sovereignty of the United States, an act
brought ; about, the memorial . says,
through a misunderstanding- and not
through hatred of the American sov
ereignty.
It further states that out of the sixty
provinces and districts war exists in only
two â Batangas Â¦ and Samar. â¢ It also as
serts tfiat u 13 a demonstrated fact that
tne pueblos or towns anxiously desire "a
definitive civil rule,'' and says those who
are still in arms allege the lack of a civil
regime "agreed upon and promulgated by
the Congress of the United btai.es as a
weighty pretext for their belligerent atti
tude, which*- regime shall determine at
once the political status and civil rights
of the inhabitants of the archipelago in
accordance with the treaty of Paris."
Â¦ The memorial then makes a. presenta
tion of the deduction of the Federal party
that Congress should proceed to carry
into effect its determination of defining
the future of the Philippines in their re
lations to the United -States, and asserts
that there is no reason for not replacing
the military regime "by a civil rule of a
popular character, in conformity with the
decisive words of the never-to-be-forgot
ten President McKinley." . > . 'â¢
The memorial is divided into two parts.
The first of these is a petition for annex
ation and. a presentation of the < orm of
government desired. In this sub-division
the Federal party sets forth that it has
made an exhaustive study, of both the
Filipinos and the Americans and con
cludes that from the mass of data col
lected it is "the intention of the two peo
ples that they should never be disunited."
The memorial announces as principles
for this union the formation of a "more
perfect union, establishment of justice,
the. Insurance of domestic tranquillity,
promotion of the general welfare and the
securing of the blessings of liberty." The
memorial then proceeds: ,,,
To make of the Philippines a colony of the
United States or to grant independence - to the
Philippines would be to hand 'the islands over
to disorder and to anarchy, to destruction and
to chaos. In effect the colonial system involves
the principles of difference of â¢ citizenship, in
equality of rights and other consequent abuses
and injustices, of all of which we Filipinos
were surfeited under the Spanish Government,
and for this reason we reject everything which
tends toward a colony. Philippine independence
with or without a protectorate means a holding
of power by all the tribal elements of the sects
which predominate and would predominate still
for some years, until the anger of Filipinos to
ward Filipinos _shall have been completely
calmed, education become general and the fa
naticism we have inherited from Spain exiled.
Federation or annexation would settle all these
difficulties f by concentration of the interest, of
the Filipino people upon education and labor.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 12.â The House
to-day passed . the oleomargarine bill.
There was no division on the final pas
sage, the real test of strength having
been made on a motion to recommit,
which wag defeated by a majority of Si.
The provision to require the inspection
and branding of renovated butter, which
was adopted In committee of the whole
yesterday, was retained to-day on an aye
and no vote.
As finally passed the bill is somewhat
modified from the form in which it was
reported from thei Committee on Agricul
ture. It makes oleomargarine or imita
tion butter or cheese transported- into
any State or Territory for use, sale or
consumption therein subject to the laws
of such States or Territories, notwith
standing that it may be introduced In
original packages, and Imposes a tax. of
10 cents per pound on oleomargarine made
in imitation of "butter of any. shade of
yellow." When not made in such imita
tion the tax is reduced to one-fourth of
one cent per pound.
The second section is intended to pre
vent dealers, hotel proprietors, restau
rant and boarding-house keepers from
coloring the uncolored article by making
any person who colors the J .'oduct and
then sells or furnishes to others a manu
facturer within the meaning of the act.
Penalties for violations of the act are a
line of not less than 550 nor more than
$500 and imprisonment for not less than
thirty days nor more than six months.
The new section relating to the Inspec
tion and branding of renovated butter is
as follows:
That the Secretary, of Agriculture Is hereby
authorized and required to cause a rigid sani
tary Inspection to be made from time to time
and at such tfmes as he may deem necessary
of all factories and storehouses where butter
if renovated; and all butter renovated at such
places shall be carefully inspected in the
same manner and to the same extent and pur
pose that meat products are now Inspected.
The quantity and quality of butter renovated
shall be reported monthly. All renovated but
ter shall be designated as such by. marks,
brands and labels and the words *'reno\-ated
butter" shall be printed on all packages there
of. In such manner as may be prescribed by
the Secretary of Agriculture and shall be sold
only as renovated butter. No renovated butter
shall be shipped or transported from one State
to another or to foreign countries unless in
spected as provided in this section.
War claims occupied attention after the
passage of the oleomargarine bill, and
the day was made notable by the passage
of the first bill for the payment of claims
of . United States citizens arising out of
the Spanish war. It carried something
over $55,000 for the pa>Â«nent of 202 claims
for property taken within the United
States for the use of the army. An om
nibus bill carrying: claims aggregating
$2,114,552 for stores and supplies - taken
from, loyal citizens during the Civil War
also was passed.
These claims were allowed under the
provisions -of .the Bowman act, and the
bill was identical with one passed by the
House at the last session. Two other
bills, which have been before Congress
for twenty-eight years to refer certain
claims for additional compensation by the
builders of certain monitors during the
Civil War to the Court of Claims, were
passed.

War Claims Obtains

Mr. Snookâ But I do call your Honor's at
tention to the early part, or the proceeding
when you thought you had full powers as a
Court Cammissloner, as the. case' had been-re
ferred to you, as you say. and counsel Iterated
The Commissionerâ Mr. Snook, the Commis
sioner says this: As to what counsel hai
threshed over there, it has no relation to my
duties whatever. If I .find that -this party is
guilty of a contempt upon the investigation of
ibis question it will be â¢ immaterial, In my
judgment, what they have found. : If my Judg
ment conflrms v me in the view that he is guilty
of contempt here I should' proceed .just the
Â«Â»me as though you had no proceedings over
there. Â¦ â¢ ' . Â¦-â¢; -. Â¦ Â¦- -â¢: Â¦ â¢
Commissioner Takes a Hand.
Mr. Snookâ By his going out. The question
was asked if Mr. Daniels could be asked a
question so that it could go into the record,
which- was consented to. Now that certainly
doesn't ehow disrespect here, lam willing to
try the question at issue here In a proper pro
ceeding, and I say the burden ought to be
upon them and not upon us. If a plaintiff
in a case brings an action In court and flies
to the southern portion of the State to avoid
giving ~d. deposition as to what his rights or
privileges are or testimony v/ould be in a case,
which the statute also gives to us. and al
though counsel called it sharp practice to get
the deposition set at an eralier day than that
at which he has set through his delay, he calls
that sharp practice to bring a man into court
to have his deposition taken under such cir
cumstances; after he had circulated broadcast
throughout the community these allegations
which he la afraid to support by his testimony
In a deposition, and flies and seeks to avoid
subpoena under such circumstances; and par
ticularly after the matter has been brought
to the court, the question of contempt here
and the court has practically said from tho
bench that he himself would not have power
to puninsh for contempt under such circum
stances If he was taking the deposition It
eeems to me that under, such a view it would
be an outrageous abuse of. the Commissioner's
power to throw upon us an additional burden
which they themselves ought to bear,' if there
is any bearing to be done in this ease, after
the court has threshed it over as thoroughly
as he did yesterday afternoon.
. Mr. Snookâ Let me suggest on that line that
Mr. Ach Is rather adroit In some things. After
we had announced the position defendant had
taken, through his counsel, there certainly was
no intent to commit any disrespect to this
Court Commissioner
The Commissioner â I don't so understand it,
Mr. Snook.
Attorney Snook Makes Bepiy.
Mr. Ach â One moment, please. The question
as to who should stand the burden cuts no
figure with this court. If a contempt was
committed, and that cannot be denied. If any
body can commit a contempt against a Com
missioner at all, then It was committed in the
immediate presence of the court; and it Is the
duty of the court to Immediately, adjudge the
party guilty of a contempt of court and force
him to take action, if he wanta'to go at lib
erty â not the plaintiff in the action. It is a
matter for the court and not for the plaintiff.'
Mr; Snook â Mr.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 12. â John Coligan, a
lineman of the San Gabriel Electric Company,
was killed by a fall from a pole to-day.
In the presence of the court, and in the pres
<Â»nce of the public for the purpose of purging
himself if that Is not true, to ask this court
to put the burden upon the plaintiff. The
burden should rest where it belongs at this
time upon the defendant, and the witness
who cavalierly picked up his hat and without
so much as "if you please" to this court
walked out of it and left his counsel to battle
for him. The burden belongs with the con
teranor if there is a contemnor; and I venture
to assert that I have never seen a more ab
solute contempt committed in the presence,
even of a notary public, than was committed
by Mr. Daniels, and I think that if this Com
missioner has the power that the courts will
so announce; and it Is simply a question of
power; and If that is the only question It is
the â¢ only question- for your Honor to consider,
because the contempt was committed in yonr
Immediate presence. The question
Commissioner Babcock announced that
he would take the matter, up -at 1:15 to
morrow afternoon. * . * â¢ t. '.,Â¦-Â¦Â¦
Mr. Snook â See how silly the proposition is
when you are talking to , the gallery, as Mr'
Ach is.'
. Mr. Ach â No, I. am talking- to you, not to
the gallery. . Tou are not the gallery. ,
- Mr. Snookâ Now, I would like a little time
if your Honor please, 1 to discuss . this matter.
These are new points. . r # . - Â¦ . ,
Mr. â¢ Achâ Yes, I think Mr. Daniels Jumned
before he ought to have jumped. .;-.-
Mr. Snookâ Well, you thought bo before '
Mr. Ach â So . I ' did, and . I am afraid you
gentlemen act on my opinion Instead of your
own. ,â¢ ' Â¦ . â¢
Mr. Snook â Well,', he -would be In Jail lone
ago if we did that. â¢-; , > .
" Mr. Achâ I want to ask him questions and
I am entitled to the original books; you know
that. . . Â¦
Mr. Ach â Now, we are trying to get you to
jail for a different purpose. I still say that
there Is no desire on my- part to put Mr. Dan
iels in jail. I want answers to my questions
and want those books produced. That is a'li
1 want. Â¦ I want to i prove the ' truth or the
falsity of those allegations out of those books
and out of the mouths of these people Who are
charged. .-Â¦â¢ .
Mr. Snook â Why don't you go and see them'
Mr. Ach? â¢ !";-.,. -
Mr. Achâ I want to have you bring them
here, In court. I want Daniels under oath.
Mr. Snookâ But you want the books.
: Mr. Ach â I want to ask him questions arid
get tho answers. Â¦ .. . â¢ .
Mr. Snook â Why don't you get an abstract
of the books then?
ilr. Snook â First you were willing to have
us In jail yesterday, .then you were for keeb
ing us. out of. Jail, and now you are trying to
get us in jail to-day.
Want the Books Produced.
Ach made some observations upon the
law arid then followed, a lively colloquy
between him and Snook; :
Mr. Achâ Well, that is disputed here, and
disputed absolutely. Now, so far as proving
our case was concerned, we were doing that
most beautifully through Mr. Daniels when ho
quit and his responses to questions which
would ' tend to prove the Issue, the statements
made In the complaint, that he didn't remem
ber and ho didn't know, were doing It in first
class style for the plaintiff. We don't expect
to prove all of our case by Mr. Collins. Mr
Collins certainly Is not expected by the de
fendants in the case .to prove the fact that
these things are not so, because we have
proven that they are so bj\ Mr. Daniels. We
have proof, for instance, that there are no
stockholders in that corporation except'Dan
iels. â¢ We have proof, for instance, that no
body had anything to do practically with ac
quiring that stock, except Pardee and Dalton
all through Daniels. Then when it becomes
convenient to Â¦ hide the books and suppress
them, and prevent them Â¦ coming Into this
court, he does so, when a gentleman of honor
and integrity against . whom these chargea
were made would Â¦ throw them . open to the
public and t to the court and say, Â»'j am inno
cent; here- are the books; examine them to
your heart's content; and I -will give you "all
the answers, that you want." I say it comes
with poor grace in such a gentleman to ask
this court to put a burden upon the plaintiff
in contempt proceedings, when If there Is any
contempt It is committed by the other party

and reiterated dozens and dozens of times
that you had no other power than that of- a
notary public. The court so held yesterday
afternoon, I Inform you, so that you may be
advised. The court held that he would only
have 6uch power If such, a proceeding was
brought before him; and I say now that a
person occupying the position that your Honor
does that would exercise power which the
court has practically held he has not got It
eeems to me in view of the circumstances of
this caeei would simply be attempting to Im
prison a man without due authority of law,
particularly as there Is no authority under the
statute for exercising- any such power by the
Court Commissioner. .

eighteen men.

REDDIICG. Feb. 12.â If all the men In
dicted for participation In the Modoc
lynching are convicted the persons who
cause their conviction can claim reward
aggregating $09,000. The Governor of
California offered a reward of $5fJ00. The
International Council of the World, a. se
cret order having branches throughout
the United Kingdom, Canada and the
United States, offers additional rewards
as follows: "The sum of $500 for the ap
prehension and conviction of each and
every person whatsoever implicated In
the murder of Calvin HalL" Then follow*
the names of the other persons lynched,
with like rewards offered. This means
that a reward of $500 Is offered for each
of the five men lynched, making a total
of $2500 for each and every person impli
cated. If eighteen men were convicted
this would yield to the detectives the sum
of $45,000.

The board found that Crackbon had no
reason to fear his life was in danger, so
wa3 not justified In using his pistol. It
had been the intention of the board to
suspend Crackbon, but the Commissioners
were informed by the City Attorney that
they had no power to suspend. There
were three things left for them to do:
Reprimand the officer, fine him or dis
miss him from the service. They did not
feel justified In, doing either of the first
two so were compelled, much as they re
gretted it, to dismiss him from the de
partment. AH the Commisisoners voted
for Crackbon's removal.
Under the rules of the Police Department that
the officer Is charged with violating he would
be permitted to flre under two states of facts,'
to wit: First, If his life is in danger; sec
ond, if - it was necessary to stay the progress
of an escaped felon. Neither of those conditions
exiHted In this case.

JAMES W. BYRNE
IS THE HOST AT A
LARGE DINNER
The Due and Duchess de Bassano and
Mile. Marie de Bassano, who with ex-
Bmpress Eugenie had been watching the
operations from Cape Martin, came to the
aerodrome to present the aeronaut their
felicitations and those of the Empress.
After a landing had been accomplished
the Prince received Santos-Dumont and
the Due de Dino on board his yacht and
arranged with the aeronaut various plans
for landing maneuvers during the next
excursion.
This is the longest trip that Santos-Du
mont has accomplished with his airship,
both as to time and distance.
At 2:35 p. m. the maneuvers' became very
difflcult. Some of the suspension wires
had been broken and the Prince had his
arm bruised by the guide rope, which
swept rapidly over the stern of the
launch. It is not thought that the Prince's
injury is serious. When the airship was
ten meters from shore guide ropes were
passed from the launch to a small boat
and then to workmen on the jetty.
At 2 o'clock, the rain having ceased. for
a moment, the aeronaut sailed away In
the direction of Cape Martin, being pre
ceded by two boats' from the Prince of
Monaco's yacht Princess Alice, and fol
lowed by a steam launch commanded by
the Prince. ,. Â¦
Half-way between the aerodrome and
Cape Martin, the sky becoming cloudy
and the wind suddenly rising, the aero
naut wheeled about. and returned to Port
d'Hercule, where the occupants of the
steam launch were able to seize the guide
rope and conduct t^he airship^ near th-3
aerodrome.
MONTE CARLO, Feb. 12.â Between
showers this afternoon Santos-Dumont
made a fourth "sortie", from his aero
drome with his airship.'

After the operation Woods was placed
in the insane ward of the Detention Hos
pital, where it was easier to watch him.
A policeman was stationed outside the
door to keep guard over the prisoner. '
Information was received from Victoria
yesterday that Kauffman, one of the men
implicated in the murder of Policeman
Robinson, had been seen in that vicinity.
It is stated that he walked from Port
land to Tacoma and stowed himself away
on the Oriental liner Victoria, with the in
tention of making the voyage to China.
Before the steamer arrived at Victoria
he was discovered and landed at that
port. His identity was unknown â¢ until
several days after, but by that time he
had escaped into the interior.
Frank Woods, alias "St. Louis Frank,"
had a bullet extracted from his back yes
terday. The operation was performed by
r>rs. Bunnell and McElroy of the Emer
gency Hospital, and Dr. Bacigalupi. A
38-caliber steel- jacketed bullet was ex
tracted and is now in the hands of the
police. It will be compared with the bul
lets taken from Policeman Robinson's
belt, and if found to be the same will.be
used as evidence against the footpad.
Detectives Wren and Dinan brought
Woods to the . hospital. The surgeons
found the wound to be superficial. They
experienced no trouble in finding the
leaden missile. It was extracted in Quick
order. Woods was wounded twice, but
one bullet found an exit.
A fat ladles' bowling match, with the
amateurs in vaudeville, i will be the spe
cial attraction art; the Chutes and Zoo this

Winchermann's bears, Rose and Jean
nette, Adelina Roattino, Reichen's hand
balancing dogs, Victor Jerome, Lottie
Fremont and Harry W, Welch are the
clever folk who make up the Orpheum'e
billthis week. Miss Norman's Imitations
of society girls are among the best things
of the kind that have been seen here,
which may also be said Â¦ of the perform
ance of Reichen's wonderful little dogs.
It is also announced that the talented
songstress, Emma Nevada, will come to
this city for a ! single concert early in
March. The diva will be accompanied , by
European artists of great ability, among
them being Pablo Casals, the noted violon
cellist; Maquarfe, the flutist, and Moreau,
a superb pianist and an artist of great
popularity In Paris. .
The Steindorff symphony concert, that
is dated for Friday afternoon next at the
Grand Opera-house, promises to be par
ticularly interesting. The progress of the
orchestra has been remarkable, from good
to better right along the line, and the
programme for Friday is also one of the
best that the society has yet offered. It
will comprise the Glinka overture, VThe
Life of the Czar;" the B minor symphony
(unfinished) of Schubert, the symphonic
poem, "Phaeton," of Saint-Saens, and a
couple of lesser numbers.
. The long expected Nordlca recitals will

The Central has a good attraction In the
strong melodrama "A Young Wife" this
week: As the bill says, it is "full of
thrills -and sensations" and is giving the
usual pleasure to the usual clientele.
Next comes "An African King."
Next week is the fourth and last of
"The AxneerV* at the Tivoli. In addition
to the many attractions of the opera as
given so far at the Tivoli an altogether
exceptional feature will be introduced
next week in the shape of some new songs
fresh from the pen of the composer, wri,t
ten especially for the Tivoli production.
Next will come the favorite of the Bos
tonians, rhe Serenade,*' to be given here
for the first time at popular prices.
This, the last week of Edwin Ardens
engagement at the Grand Opera-house, Is
given over to a play by Mr. Arden him
self that the actor-playwright calls "Rag
lan's Way." The play is not lacking in
interest and has a grateful flavor of orig
inality, but it is not possessed "â¢ of the
marked strength of the other play of Mr.
Arden's that .has been given here. The
company does good work in the drama,
more particularly Mr. Arden, Miss Terry,
Gardner Crane, H. D. Byers and Laura
Nelson Hall. Next week George Ober be
gins a limited engagement in "A Temper
ance Town."
There is a very good production of the
Augustin Daly piece, "The Rogue's Com
edy," at the Alcazar Theater this week.
The clever company at the Alcazar is par
ticularly well cast in the play, many of
the players finding unusually grateful op
portunities in its lively predicaments and
well-drawn characters. Margaret Wych
erly and Marion Convere among the
women and M.' L. Alsop. Frank Bacon
and George Osborne among the men are
especially enjoyed. Next week "The Ori
ental Express" will be put on.
"The Sign of the Cross," ut the Califor
nia Theater, will begin the second week
of its engagement on Monday night next.
It is a strong play of powerful religious
interest, and is being very well given at
the California Theater. There aie many
of the people of the original production
at the Columbia some three years ago to
be found in the cast, notably Charles Dal
ton, who in ' his original role of Marcus
Superbus is a virile and graceful figure.
Mignon Shattlnger as Mercia also adds
much to the success of the piece, with
Agnes Scott and Marcella Hudson.
Viola Allen ends her highly siTccessful
engagement at the Columbia on Saturday
evening. The houses are crowded nightly.
The next production at , the Columbia
Theater will be the pastoral success "Way
Down , East," the interesting drama of
New England life that met with so much
favor on' its ' first presentation here last
year. With the company comes Miss
Grace Craib Hull, a former San Francisco
girl, who has been steadily, winning fame
before- the footlights. Miss Hull arrived
in town on Tuesday evening, and a large
contingent of friends will be at the Co
lumbia on Monday night to welcome her.
"Way Down Easf'is a William A. Brady
production, and, like all shows stamped
with his name, the scenic arrangements
will be of the best.
The "solid six" in the Council have been
grilled to a turn to-day for their refusal
yesterday to- give the Clark interests an
opportunity to raise the bid of their rivals,
after that privilege had been â¢"â¢anted to
the Huntlngton-Hellman syndicate.
It is known that papers In the proposed
legal proceedings are already In course of
preparation.
A new complication Is Injected Into the
pending contest, owing to the -fact that
the certified checks tendered by the Hunt
ington-Hellman syndicate in payment for
the franchises were not cashed until this
morning. The law expressly states that
cash must be tendered at the time the
franchises are awarded and the Davis-
Clark people had $133,000 in "good red
gold" piled up in the City Hall to cover
their bid. Local lawyers assert that the
failure of the Huntington. contingent to
put up coin invalidates their purchase.
"Mr. Hook and his associates will not
abandon this contest until they have ex
hausted the last expedient of the law,"
says F. J. Thomas, with respect to the
struggle bet-ween the Hook-Clark and the
Huntington-Hellman syndicate for the
electric freight franchise. "We are not
ready to indicate the methods we may
pursue in prosecuting the warfare, but
the public may be assured that there will
be no faltering on our part. We are in
the fight to win and we have the law on
our side."
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 12.â T. E. Gibbon
gives it out officially that Senator "W. A.
Clark, of Montana has bought a controll
ing Interest in the Loa Angeles Traction
Railroad, with which enterprise tho name
of .Hook has hitherto been almost the only
one associated. That Senator Clark
should invest some portion, of his" vast
capital In this enterprise means that the
traction company will become even more
of a thorn in the side of H. E. Hunting
ton, who had hoped to buy the rival. With
Senator Clark back of the traction road
that property is not likely to be> gobbled
up, even by so rich, a corporation as that
of the Huntington syndicate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
: Mr. Ach (continuing) â Who Is charged by
a plaintiff In a case who has equal rights
with himself, of doing acts for 'the purpose of
defrauding him. and- bas not only done the
acts, but is continuing to do them, to appear
before a Court Commissioner In such a case,
and decline to permit the fullest Investigation
Mr. Acb â It certainly comes with bad grace
from a defendant in an' action who is charged
with willful susDression of Interest in books,
who is charged
. Mr. Snook â Which we are willing to show
you at any time.
Burden Belongs With the Contemnor.
Mr. Snook â Now, of course, if you are going
to throw the burden upon us of this litigation,
it strikes me that if there is any burden to be
thrown It ought to be thrown under Intimation
of Judge Ogden upon the attorney for the
plaintiff. If you are a judicial officer then they
can review your acts by going to the court
and asking that you be Instructed so , to - do,
or upon your refusal to set aside the . order
Â¦which you made. . . . ,
The Commissionerâ "Well It would be very
strange, of course, to me if I should be called
upon to decMe at the drop of the hat a vexed
question like this which you irentlemen were
discussing all yesterday afternoon. I heard a
portion of Judge Oirden's opinion, but only a
portion. I commenced investigating this quei
tlon thia morning and have had hardly time to
arrive at a definite conclusion. My impres
sions are with the counsel for the plaintiff
here, but I don't want to put any unnecesaary
hardEhip tipt>a Daniels or any unnecessary ex
pense and trouble. Instead of passing unoa
the question as to whether Daniels is guilty
of contempt this afternoon. I will ask If it
be convenient for counsel to postpone that
decision until to-morrow, and then I will ren
der my opinion about It.. My ' impression, I
am frank to say. Snook, is that I have juris
diction to punish for contempt.
I aek your Honor to find Daniels guilty of
contempt of court and impose the sentence and
issue the warrant for hie arrest in that he did
violate your order in your immediate presence
and while you were engaged in the perform
ance of your official duty, namely, that of
taking a deposition- under the constitution and
the etatute of this State, In leaving your pres
ence without so much as "If you please," and
while he was upon the stand. And in subdi
vision 3: "To compel the. attendance of pei
eons to testify In a proceeding before him. l.i
the cases ani manner Drovided in this code,"
In that he did attend in obedience to a sub
poena and left the courtroom declining to pro
duce books which were in his possession; and
under section 178, which provides as follows:
"For the effectual exercise of the power* con
ferred by the last section a judicial officer mav
punish for contempt in the cases provided in
this code." That your Honor is a judicial of
ficer, I call your attention to article 6, sec
tion 14. of the constitution of this State, and
section 15. Section 14 is to the effect that
"The Legislature shall provide or may pro
vide for the appointment by. the several Su
perior Courts of one or more commissioners in
their respective counties, with authority to per
form chamber business of the Judges of the
Superior Court, to take depositions and per
form such other business connected with tht
administration of justice as may be prescribed
by law." The point being that the constitution
is mandatory and self-acting, and that the
power to take the depositions comes from the
constitution itself, and by section 15 of article
1 of the constitution It expressly and directly
recognizes Court Commissioners as Judicial of
ncers. and judicial officers as mentioned in
chanter 4, sections 177 and 17S: "No judlciil
officer, except Justices of the Peace and Court
Commissioners, shall receive to his own use
any fees or perquisites of office." This con
tempt bavins occurred In the immediate pres
ence of this court, we ask that this court
adjudge G. B. Daniels guilty of a contempt of
court and lmoose the punishment and direct his
arrest, and that he be brought before you for
that purpose, and . If you haven't any power
let the Supreme Court say so.
Commissioner Reserves His Decision.
Says "Witness Is in Contempt.
Sir. Ach â And here note. Mr. Reporter, that
the witness, G. B. Daniels, left the courtroom
while uixm the stand, saying good-Cay with
out being excused by interrogating counsel or
by the Court Commissioner or court, and upon
that conduct we ask the Court Commissioner,
the matter occurrine in the presence of the
court and in the presence of the Court Com
missioner, to find him guilty of a contempt of
court, under provisions of the code.
Mr. Snook â I want to r>ay further in regard
to these books I want to extend every cour
tesy to counsel for plaintiff, and that any di
rector or any etockholder may view the books
at any time at the office of the corporation,
and any transcripts can be taken during busi
ness hours that they desire from those books;
that they are now in the custody of the book
keeper of the Institution.
Mr. Ach â I move to strike out the statement
of counsel a> irrelevant and Immaterial, and
under chanter 4. sections 1T6. 177 and 178 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, which provide as
follows: "Every judicial officer shall have
power: 1. To preserve and enforce order ir.
his immediate presence and in proceedings be
fore him when he is engaged in the perform
ance of official duty."
Mr. Achâ Make the order.
The Commissioner â Let me Â«ee the subpoena;
I want to aee that eubpoena.
Ach Quotes the Law.
Snook finally consented to allow Dan
iels to answer, and the witness replied
that he had not. When asked for a rea
son he said that he saw no reason for
bringing them.
Ach then made a formal demand that
the Court Commissioner order the produc
tion of the books. It was while Ach was
making his demand that Daniels took hib
hat and left the room with the simple
statement, "Goo*-day,- gentlemen." JTheat
the battle of counsel and the demands of
attorneys followed fast.
The proceedings this afternoon opened
with a -fight. Daniels was called to the
stand, and the first question asked was
whether he had brought the books that
have been demanded.
"We decline to go further," said" Charles
E. Snook, Daniels' attorney.
It is evident that the parties in the case
are going to fight the matter out and, if
necessary, carry it to the Supreme Court,
for upon this ruling of Judge Ogden rests
the possibility of getting any more infor
mation through the means of depositions.
The surprise to them came when Henry
Ach and J. B. Richardson, the attorneys
for Collins, produced a lot of law and de
cisions to show that if the Superior Court
could not punish, the Court Commissionei
was a judicial officer under the constitu
tion and that he could punish for con
tempt of himself. This upset the feeling
of security of the defendants, and when
Court Commissioner Babcock said that
ho believed he had the power to commit
for contempt of himself and he would or
der Daniels to appear to-morrow and
show cause why he should not be pun
ished there was a long and wordy battle
between the attorneys.
Daniels Is Cited for Contempt.
It was a day of surprises and sensa
tions to all the parties in the case. The
defendants in general and Daniels in par
ticular were resting easily last night, and
this morning under the decision delivered
by Judge Ogden. Under this decision
there was absolutely no further use of
trying to take depositions, for Judge Og
den had held that there was no method
of punishing a witness for refusing to an
swer questions propounded before a no
tarv public or a Court Commissioner.
Judge Ogden had frankly stated from the
bench yesterday that he would be com
pelled to decide that a witness who re
fused to answer could not be punished by
appealing to the Superior Court which the
Court Commissioner or notary public was
supposed to represent, even though such
a ruling would make the taking of a
deposition impossible.
And so the defendants were happy, be
cause they felt that there was no longer
any necessity of making any more ap
pearances in these distasteful proceed
ings.
The result of this act was that Court
Commissioner Babcock cited him to, ap
pear before him to-morrow and show
cause why he should not be punished for
contempt of the Court Commissioner. And
bo by far the most dramatic incident in
a long series of sensations in the now
famous Colllns-Pardee-Dalton-Daniels-En
qulrer suit occurred.
OAKLAND. Feb. 12.â At the third quen
tion propounded to G. B. Daniels, presi
dent and general manager of" the Oak
land Enquirer Publishing Company, at the
continuation of the taking of his deposi
tion before Court Commissioner Babcock
to-day Daniels clapped his hat on his
head and walked out of the room with a
"Good-day, gentlemen," without answer
ing the question.

tions of the Bible occasioned wide com
ment in Methodist church circles, to-day
resigned as professor of English litera
ture at Northwestern University. The
resignation, it is stated, was voluntary.
The battle, which was one of the most
desperate in the history of mountain war
fare, occurred between 4 and 6 o'clock this
evening at Lee Turner's "Quarter House"
saloon, three and a half miles from Mid
dlesboro. Last month some mules and
other goods of Turner's were levied on
in payment for a debt and a few nights
ago, it is allege'J, he, with others, went
to Virginia, where the property had been
taken, secured what was formerly, his
and returned to tho "Quarter House."
To-day Deputy Sheriff Wat Thompson
summoned a posse of ten or fifteen men
for the purpose of arresting Turner at his
saloon. Tne Louisville and Nashville
Railroad refused to convey the officers to
the saloon and they walked through the
mountains. Turner had heard that an at
tempt would be made to arrest him and
he and his men, fifteen in number, gave
the officers a warm reception. The saloon
Â¦was well suited for an attack like this.
It was built of logs and was surrounded
by a thirty-foot fence in which loopholes
were cut so that the inmates could shoot
at outsiders. Â¦ , . â,
Turner's surrender v/as demanded. His
reply was a round of shots. Charley
Cecil of Middlesboro was riding a pony in
plain view of the Turner men. Some one
raised a window of the loghouse and shot
Cecil, who fell dead. Instantly the man
at the window fell back, pierced by half
a dozen bullets. Then the firing began to
earnest. The officers scattered and, hid
ing behind trees, poured a galllng^nie
into the mountain fortress. In the fight
John Doyle, a railroad man, was shot m
tb The tt ?own men gathered closer around
Turner's place, undaunted by the shots
which whizzed around them. As soon as
Cecil was killed his companions deter
mined to burn Turner's rendezvous, and
in the midst of the battle a mail Â» app led a
torch to an exposed side of the building.
Soon the building was in flames. Several
of the mountaineers came to the window
and were Immediately shot down. Ohe
members of the posse surrounding . the
barricade were determined to let none es
cape. Lee Turner and several of , his
friends, however, in some manner escaped
and he Is now at the Mingo mines, fight
miles from Middlesboro. Several of his
men perished in the names. â¢
All sorts of rumors are afloat to-night,
one being that five Turnerites were killed
by the rifles of the attacking men and
that five more perished in the flames. It
is also believed that the posse lost more
men than one, and that some of the AUdr
dlesboro fighters may now be lying deau
or dying in hollows surrounding the
"Quarter House." Some of the deputies
came in to-night with their â¢ rifles over
their shoulders. They state that half the
men are still at the "Quarter House and
that they will return with reinforcements.
It is feared that the trouble Is not at an
Turner is not a man who is easily
cowed, and it is believed that he will or
ganize a band and avenge the deaths of
his friends and the cumins of his saloon.
Turner is a brother of "Wild Bill Tur
ner who was killed some years ago. luc
"Quarter House" is known far and wide
because of the number who have been
killed within its confines. Placing to-day's
number of deaths at six. . fifty-nine per
sons have been killed there and- twice that
number wounded. â¢ Â¦

MANDARIN OF THE
Precious Ruby Clasp.
!
An Illustrious Chinese mandarin was
put on the famous American food, Grape- '
Nuts, and he and his wife cured of stom-
ach and kidney trouble and heart dis-
order after he, In particular, had been
pronounced by his physician incurable.
His letter is -written by his interpreter
and signed -with his Chinese signature.
It recites: "For three years I was under
thÂ© care of the best physicians in Russia,
Germany, France, America, as well as
my own country. I had tried baths and
water cures almost without number. 1 1
grew worse until finally my physician
pronounced me incurable and I was
doomed to diÂ« in from three to six
months.
"A friend prevailed upon me to change
my food and take up Grape-Nuts. This
I did more to " gratify my friend than
from any benefit I expected, but within
twenty-four hours the results were so
gratifying as to astonish and delight my-
self and family.
"My Improvement continued without re-
lapse until at the end of thred months I
was well and sound, weighed more and
was stronger and had a better appetite
and more perfect digestion than at any
other time In my life.
"Sly wife was also a victim, of serlou3
fitomacb trouble from which she had
suffered for several years. She has been
restored to good robust health by the
use of Grape-Nuts.
"I have recommended It in about half
a dozen families, and it bas never failed
to benefit. I will be pleased to reply to
all letters having stamped envelope en-
cosed." Pak Gaw Mun. Mandarin of the
Ruby Button, member of the Literati,
magistrate of the Order of the Manchu-
rlan Crane. Order of the Girdle of the
Jade and Precious Ruby Clasp, servant
to his Imperial Majesty, the Son of
Heaven, etc., etc.
His Interpreter and secretary, E. Per-
civale Baker, adds to the letter: "I am
familiar with all the facts related by
Professor Pak and know them to have
been moderately stated. I also, arid-.jtny
family, have received much benefit from
the use of Grape-Nuta." j

â¢? Dear Mrs. Pestkham : â I felt rerr
discouraged two years ago, I had suf-
fered so long with kidney troubles and
other complications, and had taken so
much medicine without relief that I
began to think there was no hope for
me. Life looked so good to me, but
what is life, without health ? I wanted
to Ibe well.
MRS. LOUISE M. GIBSON.
"Iiydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
ta'ble Compound cured me and made
me well, and that is why I gladly
write you this, and gladly thank you ;
six bottles was all I took, together .
with . your Pills. My headache and.
backache aad kidney trouble went,
never to return ; the burning sensation
I" had left altogether; my general
health was so improved I felt as young
and light and happy as at twenty.

OAKLAND. Feb.' 12.â Friends of Frank
Maguire, an old boatman, who lived foi
years on the estuary at the foot of East
Fourteenth street, becoming alarmed at
his failure to appear in his old haunts,
instituted a search to-day and found his
dead body lying on the floor, of his cabin.
He is supposed to have been dead at least
a week. The exposed portions of the body
had been badly mutilated by rodents. Be
side the body was found a demijohn of.
liquor and two phials of strychnine. It
was at first thought the old * man had
killed himself, - but Â¦ an autopsy showed
that heart disease had overtaken him. A
Coroner's jury to-night found that he
had died from natural causes.

Must Look After Water Supply.
This suggests that the State must look
out for the water supply as something
vital. A park without a stream of water
would be of little availability to the gen
eral public.
Experts are still Inquiring into various
matters connected with the duties of the
park. The Â¦ park bill made the money
available only in installments of 150,000 per
annum. This has been supposed by some
to be a bar to condemnation proceedings,
but It is ascertained that some of the
Commissioners think that difficulty, can
be met by condemning by piecemeal. The
Commissioners say that the park must be
one continuous. body and not consist of
separated tracts. These general state
ments indicate the extent of the work that
the commission ' has in hand, which Is a
much larger proposition thanMf a private
party were simply buying a tract of lum
ber land of similar cost.
There is no likelihood that the commis
sion will pay $100 an acre; but, whatever
the price may be, the cost of preservation
and the extent of the tract that it will
be necessary to acquire to insure such
preservation are leading questions, to
which the Commissioners have already
given thought. _
"While there is a mention in tbjp law of
the Big Basin, there is no survey that
definitely establishes just what is and
what is not the Big Basin. There are hills
surrounding several depressions in Santa
Â¦Cruz County and each of these is large
enough to be called a Big Basin. Pre
sumably the commission will prefer the
section about the fork â¢ of the Waddell
Creek, where last summer the "Gov
ernor's camp" was placed by the lumber
men. The amount of watershed necessary
to be acquired to maintain the creek has
been a subject for much discussion on
the part of the Commissioners. Unless
the State has control of the watershed,
the waters of the creek could be easily
diverted by private parties.
It is told as a curious circumstance that
last summer when the Commissioners
were in the Basin, while there was very
little water running in the. creek, there
was quite a show of water in front of the
buildings at the Governor's camp. An in
vestigation of this phenomenon led to the
discovery that the creek had been dammed
up some distance below the camp.
No Money for Preservation.
Serious questions have arisen for the
Redwood Park Commissioners to consider.
The Commissioners are charged with the
duty of acquiring and preserving for park
purposes a tract of land in the Big Basin.
The second part of this public service
seems to have escaped the notice of many
persons who have been abusing the Com
missioners and trying to hasten their ac :
tion by stories to the effect that if there
is any delay â¢ the lumbermen, who have
all the land- that has been offered to the
State at the rate of $100 per acre, will
start in to cut down the trees and deprive
the State of ever having a real Semper
virens Park.. .
The preservation of the trees naturally
includes the duty of protecting them from
fire. It also involves a continual expense.
The State appropriated $250,000 for the pur
poses mentioned in the bill providing for
the acquisition and preservation of a
sempervirens reservation. The owners of
lands that have been offered seek to get
the entire $250,000 for 2500 acres. If the
commission pays that price there will be
no money left for the preservation of the
forest trees. . . Â¦ â¢

Miss Mary C. McKlnney, a teacher, in
the School Department, against whom
charges of insanity were made by Albert
J. Lyser, principal of the John Swett
School, retaliated yesterday by filing
charges against Lyser with the Board "of
Education. Miss McKinney alleges that
Lyser perjured himself in presenting the
charges against her and is therefore
guilty of unprofessional conduct.
The Board of Education refuses to make
the text of the charges- public, but in all
likelihood Lyser will be subjected to the
ordeal of trial. Lyser has brought charges
against a number of teachers and is re
garded as the official accuser of the
School Department.
The board turned the complaint over to
Superintendent Webster, who says that
Miss McKinney charges unprofessional
conduct against Lyser.
Miss McKinney Retaliates on Prin-
cipal Who Accused Her of
Insanity.
CHARGES AGAINST LYSER.
Luhr told the Judge who tried him that
It was his first offense and that he had
been sorely tempted by poverty. The
Judge, taking pity upon him, dismissed
the charge. Within three days after hi3
discharge he repeated his offense and was
arrested, but owing to the fact that the
checks had been drawn on a San Fran
cisco bank, the State refused to prosecute
because of the expense of bringing wit
nesses to Colorado from. San Francisco.
The secret service people then took him in
hand and had him indicted by the Federal
Grand Jury on the charge of impersonat
ing an officer of the United States army.
Luhr's folks reside in Oakland'.
Luhr was arrested on March 27, 1900, in
Cheyenne, , Colo., on the charge of horse
stealing, and on January 7, 1901, was sen
tenced to ten years' . imprisonment in the
prison reformatory at Buena Vista, Colo.
He was released at the end of a year and
shortly afterward was rearrested for
passing a worthless check.
Secret Service Agent Hazen received a
letter yesterday from Secret Service
Agent Joseph A. Walker of Denver, Colo.,
asking for information as to the career
of Henry C. Luhr, alias Elmer C. Cole, the
Oakland youth who defrauded several
people in this city and Oakland by posing
as a lieutenant in the army and passing
forged checks. \
Henry ' Luhr, Alias Elmer Cole, an
Oakland Youth, Is in Serious

PSUEDO â¢ LIEUTENANT
TO BE TBZEIMN DENVEB
Piatt's testimony was almost the same
as given, by him. in .the Buckley murder
trial. He testified that he was; sitting on
the front dummy of the car with his
daughter, . Erline. Two young men were
standing on the steps in front of them.
One was Buckley, who was holding on by
the forward stanchion, and the other,
whom he positively identified as.; the de
fendant, Moran, was hanging on by the
middle stanchion. He could not help ob
taining a good impression of Moran s
features, as he was standing directly in
front of him from Tenth street till the
car reached Twentieth. There a young
lady who was sitting next to his daughter
wanted to leave the car, but Buckley was
in her way. She had to touch him on
the back twice before he stepped off and
allowed her to leave. Moran at the same
time dropped off the car, and apparently
walked backward toward the street. â¢--;
The next minute there was a "mix-up,
and he saw Moran clubbing a man, whom
he afterward learned was Rice. Rice had
come from the back of the car, and when
he saw him he was holding his hands
over his head, protecting it from the
blows. Rice was struck several times and
fell to the ground. While Rice was lying
on his back Buckley walked around and
shot him four times. Then Moran and
Buckley ran down Twentieth street and
the witness ran after Buckley for about
fifty yards, but stopped as he heard his
daughter scream.
Piatt was also asked as to why his
daughter,- Erline, was not present . as a
witness, and he replied that she was
sick in the City of Mexico. Policeman
Charlea W. Brown was called and testi
fied that he had a subpena to serve upon
Erline Piatt, but could not find her.
Judge Mogan swore . to the' girl having
testified before him at the preliminary
examination and Daniel W. Long, sten-,
ographer, declared that he made a cor
rect transcript of her testimony. Attor
ney Collins for- the defendant made a
strong objection to the girl's testimony
being read, but the Judge overruled him
and it was> read to the jury. She corrob
orated her father's evidence as to the
general incidents, but could not identify
Moran, as her attention was centered up
on Buckley, who fired the shots. The
hearing , will be resumed this morning.
The trial of Thomas Moran for the mur
der of I George W. Rice, the non-union
machinist,; at Twentieth and Howard
streets on the evening of October 11, was
continued before a jury in Judge Law
lor's court yesterday. The only witness
of importance examined was Walter J.
Piatt of 2496 Howard street.
Gustave Schnee urged that a school
house be erected in the Sunnyside i dis
trict. Schnee referred to the fact that
fourteen lots had been offered to the
board "for $3250, which offer was refused.
Subsequently fifteen lots were offered for
$7000, and the price may be increased.
Director Woodward's resolution that the
office hours be so arranged that one di
rector be on duty all the time was defeat
ed. Woodward first asked that Miss J. A.
Dwyer be assigned to a fifth grade class in
the Burnett School in compliance with a
court decision, but his colleagues refused
to acquiesce.
H. H. Thomas notified the board that
contributions are being- received from
school children in violation of the rules
of the department. President Denman
will investigate the matter.
W. J. Thompson, a janitor, who filed
charges against Principal Morton of the
Lowell High School, petitioned to be rein
stated in his position, from which he says
he was dismissed without a hearing.
Miss.Rae Cohen was assigned to the
Horace Mann Evening School.
Leaves of absence were granted to -Miss
E. J. Miller, Everett School; Miss Annie
E. Owen, Dr. Margaret Mahony, Miss
Maud Hart, Miss Tillie Stohr, Miss C. B.
Earle'and Miss Alice A. Morton.'
The Superintendent's report regarding
the alleged inattention to duty of Dr.
Max Magnus, physical director, was read,
and the board took the matter under ad
visement. Webster reported that Magnus
had devoted a total of 116 hours to his
duties in 1901, for which he received a sal,
ary of $2700. He also neglected to visit
fifteen schools. It is not unlikely that the
three professors â Miehling, Barth and
Stahlâ who were deposed to make room
for Magnus will be restored to their posi
tions.
The Board of Education yesterday prac
tically . whitewashed Principal M. E.
Blanchard of the Hancock" Grammar
School of the charge that he had inflicted
unusually severe punishment on John
Raggio, a 12-year-old pupil. The board
adopted a resolution administering a mild
reprimand to Blanchard, â¢ but not before
Director Roncovieri htÂ« entered a vigor
ous protest against its adoption. Ronco
vieri insisted that Blanchard be given* a
trial and that he be dismissed from the
department if guilty. . Roncovieri's col
leagues voted him down, however^
O'Brien told his cellmates In the prison
that he was determined to make his es
cape and wondered whether, if he jumped
off the boat, he would be fired upon. That
was why the prison officials warned Hol
ley to put the handcuffs on him.
It was not many minutes later when
Holley returned to the prison . and de
jectedly told how O'Brien had given him
the slip. He said when they got to the>
hotel O'Brien asked to be allowed to go to
a lavatory. Holley granted the prisoner's
request. That was the last he saw of
O'Brien. , Some one had seen him run
out of the hotel, along Kearny street and
down Washington street in .the direction
of the water front. Holley will .remain
in the city for a few days and hunt for
the f uzitive.
Hoiiey ! arrived from Bed Bluff with
O'Brien Tuesday night and locked him up
in tne City Prison till yesterday morning
so that he could take the lirst boat. He
was up early and left with -his prisoner
about 7 o'clock. When he reacned the
ferry he found, to his annoyance, that he
had lett the commitment papers in the
prison and returned with O'Brien . to ob
tain them. The prison officials suggested
that he should allow O'Brien to remain
there till the departure of : the next b.oat,
but /Holley; preferred to take him to the
International Hotel. Holley was advised
to put J.the irons, on his prisoner, but he
laughed and, remarked that he thought
he was quite capable of taking care of
him. â¢ ....
Deputy Sheriff O. J. Holley of Tehama

whom he was taking to San Quentin to
