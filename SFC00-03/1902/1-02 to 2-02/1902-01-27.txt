THE police have been informed that the murderers of Offi cer Robinson â Henderson, the wounded robber; "Kid" Goucher and "Brownie"â -intended to liberate two of their "pals" who are confined in the County Jail
at the cost, if necessary, of the lives of the prison guards. The plot was exposed by Stage Robber Ivers, who overneaid the details of.their daring scheme. Ivers was taken sick the day following the exposure of the
plot and an examination revealed that poison had been placed in 1 his. coffee, if is thought by members of the gang of assassins. . Goucher^ and '"Brownie" are still at Jarge, but the police are close upon them and con

After. the- big elk had finished his sav
age deed he pawed and tore the ground
of the inclosure, snorting 1 for hours, an
ugly spectacle, covered with blood and
flashing madness from his eyes. None could
approach within a few feet of the high
rail and barbed wire fence without draw
ing a mad chargefrom the beast, which
was in a furious rage. Its companions in
the herd were affected by the monster's
rage and made the park ring with their
snorts of savage anger.
Probably Suffering From Fever.
That the big elk should have eo' sudden
ly returned to its wild state after many
years in captivity 'was as much of a* sur
prise' to the'park managers and employes
as the fact that the beast should have at
tacked ; young "' Furtado. who for .: many
months has been accustomed to go'among
the herd as if they were so many Jersey
kirle. The reasons ascribed by the broth
er : are twoâ first, he thinks ; that the bull
was fretting because of the' season of 'the
year.' Amdnth from now the antlers will
drop, and the elk was probably suffering
from ; fever : and itching about < the head.
The body was borne to a-Â«lubhouse. Dr.
G. H. Llliencrantz was called : out from
Oakland, but after examination' he could
only say that nothing could be done.' Later
during the day the Coroner- was sum
moned and he took charge of the remains.
Catching the boy up in his arms, Fur
tado could only hear' the ' last "gasp Â¦> as
death relieved the youth's sufferings.
"The elks are. killing a man!" was the
cry that startled both men. . Toward the
paddock rushed Furtado. grabbing a
pitchfork as he ran. Arriving' at the
fence his- eyes caught a glimpse of the
mangled body lying near by.. Not know-
Ing that It was that of his own '. brother,
the -foreman rushed over to the- form.
y'Uy God, It's Frank!" he cried, as he
recognized the Jimp body.
The Spencer boy had flea upon the ap
proach of the elk, and he escaped injury.
As he was making his way across the
park crying for assistance the brother of
the slain boy, who is foreman of the
grounds, was summoned, by another
youth, who had seen the savage attack
from outside the grounds. The older
brother -was then In conversation with
Manager Havens of the Realty Syndicate,
which owns the park. -'Â¦'- ;' ': ~\

The horrible affair occurred In the

of the big animals form one of the at
tractions of that suburban pleasure
ground at Oakland. The lad who met the
awful mangling had gone into the cor
ral to feed the herd, a duty he had per
formed for ft year, until about three
months ago. 'With him was Leslie Spen

savage brute pitched its unconscious and

In event any. opposition was offered it
was.' the Intention of the would-be res
cuers to shoot the' turnkey and the depu
ties who were <Iri charge of the jail.
The desperate plan failed through Ivers,
who managed to learn enough of their
conversation to satisfy him that Â¦ murder
was Intended in order to liberate the two
crooks. . ;..-'-. '.
As he had been treated kindly by the
men In fcharge of the jail the stage rob
ber, .after thinking over the. matter, re
solved to inform one of the deputies of
what he had heard.' . .
He said the two men whom the blood
thirsty trio were anxious to liberate were
"Kid" 'Williams, a noted crook, and Wil
liam Gallie, who is known as a hardened
criminal. .
Were Members of the Gang.
Both prisoners, the police claim, are
members of the gang of which Henderson,
who is supposed to have shot theÂ«pollce
â¢officer, was the ringleader. Shortly after
they were sent to the County Jail they
were visited by Henderson, "Kid" Goucher
and "Brownie." Realizing that they were
"up against it," as' "Brownie" expressed
it, he suggested that they make an at
tempt.to liberate them. Their ->lan was
for Goucher to visit the jail at a certain
hour and call for Williamr. While he was
conversing with him it was agreed that
"Brownie" and Henderson shoud appear
and seek the privilege of * speaking to
Gallie. After being admitted, they were
to overpower the turnkey, and', after cov
ering the guards with their pistols, llber^
ate the two men. It was clearly under
stood that in case the guards'showed fight'
they were to be shot down.
While the murderous criminals were dis
cussing the: details of the scheme, Ivers,
"who happened to hear enough, to convince
him that a desperate attempt was' to be
made to liberate Willlams'and Gallie, no
tified the. officer in charee. , , :
Extra Precautions Taken. *
As soon. as the matter was reported to
Chief Jailer Frank Cornyn he ordered
that an extra guard be stationed in the
jail. The deputies; were told ' L to have
their pistols: in] readiness to circumvent
any attempt to Â¦ liberate Williams:, and
Gallic The night the threatened jail de
livery was to ' have; occurred Goucher
showed up at thejail.^but evidently Real
izing from the conduct of the guards
that the plot had been discovered, he
promptly withdrew. "Brownie" and
Henderson Were waiting outside and|were
considerably disappointed on learning
from the "Kid" that the guards had an
ticipated; their visit and were ready to
give them battle. With curses for Ivers,
whom they, suspected of informing the
chief jailer of their plot, they walked
up Broadway and soon disappeared. '
The following day Ivers was taken, ser
iously 111 'after drinking a cup of coffee.
As he exhibited symptoms of \ poisoning

with the - aid of a stomach pump he re
lieved - him of a quantity of '. "yen sheeV

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 26.â W. G. Nevin,
general ' manager of the Santa i Fe lines
west of Albuquerque, * died suddenly and
unexpectedly this morning after an in
terval of unconsciousness lasting thirty
minutes.- The Immediate cause of death
is, thought to have been paralysis of the
cariac nerves. Nevin retired 1 at an early
hour Saturday evening in the best of
spirits. This morning he was about to
rise, - when, - with a scarcely audible ar
ticulation he turned over on his side, ap
parently dead. Mrs. Nevin,- who/ was in
the room at the timer rushed to his side
and found him still breathing, but in a
comatose state. She hastily summoned
her son, and the two endeavored to re
suscitate the stricken man, but in vain.
Before the arrival of a -physician Nevin
died without regaining consciousness.
In January, 1901, Nevin partially lost
the. use of his right arm and upon con
sulting a physician found- that he was
suffering from what is called' "creeping
paralysis." He was advised to give up
aa active work and accordingly secured
a six months' leave of absence. While in
the East he consulted a number of emi
nent physicians and tried various meth
ods of treatment. \
After an absence of about three months
he returned to'Los Angeles, irreatly Im
proved in health. He resumed his duties
in the local headquarters of the Santa Fe,
and it was not until January 18, when he
was confined to his home by a slight at
tack of grippe, that he again absented
himself from his office. . His illness on
this occasion was not of a serious nature
and he declined medical aid, being ground
ed in a belief in Christian science. It is
understood that he. received treatment
from a practitioner of this faith. He im
proved rapidly and on the day before his
death had so far recovered as to dictate
a number of letters during the morning
and take a drive in the afternoon.
William G. Nevin was born in Philadel
phia in 1855. At the age of 16 he went to
Denver: and began his business career as
clerk In a mercantitle house. In 1876 he
entered the service of . the Philadelphia
and Reading Railway as a bill clerk. Two
years later he again wended his way
-westward and became Identified with the
construction department of the Santa Fe
lines in Kansas. Â¦ In 1S30 he secured the
position of material agent of the Sono'ra
Railway, in. Mexico, land after six years*
residence in the southern republic he re
turned to Philadelphia, engaging in the
coal trade there. ,- ..,.--Â¦
In 1892 he sold out his business inter
ests in the Quaker City and accepted a
position as purchasing agent for the MeÂ±
ican Central ; Railway with headquarters
at Galveston, Tex. Later he received an
appointment as assistant general man
ager of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe
road, and in 1S&> was promoted to the
position of general ! purchasing agent for
the entire Santa Fe system. In 1897 he
was appointed successor of K. H.' Wade
formerly general manager for the lines
west of Albuquerque.'and removed to this
city, which has since been his home

"My, brother's kind heart brought about
his death. The elks were his special pets,
and when he heard yesterday that the new
man who has cared. for them for. the past
three months fed them from outside the
fence instead of going among them, as
had been his own habit, he was afraid his
pets .would -get wild, so; he went down
there to-day to fondle them a little. Then
the old bull caught him unawares and It
was soon all over. .... . :-'.'!Â¦â¢
' "I [ was = standing about 400 yards from
the elk pen at the time of the . accident,
talking to Mr. Havens, | tne manager. Mr.
Havens suddenly said: 'Who is that man
running. wild?' I looked up and saw some
one running toward - us and ' heard him
shout: 'The elks are killing a man!', 'You
must | be joking,' I replied; for the elks
are ordinarily tame as kittens.
"I started toward the pen, but I didn't
run far before I found that the big bull
was no longer tame." He was bellowlnjr
hoarsely. and squealing with rage,: and I
could hear him butting against the fence.
. '.'I â¢ caught up Â«a pitchfork as â¢ I ran, and
as I came within sight I "saw the form of
a man on the ground close to = the" fence
on the outside and the bull; trying to get

In . a minute he was gone, i The bloody

himself Â¦ was still j clutched in his hand.

More than, that, for several months Fuc
tado had not been among his pets, as he
called them, and the big fellow that at
tacked him was not in a mood to enjoy
the intrusion of one who appeared a
stranger. .
It was 'his love for the elk that caused
his death. The young man had 'nursed
and petted the herd, made them his-par
ticular care during, all this time, until
other duties caused him to give up the
work.. A new keeper was installed, but
instead of going Into the. paddock as Fur
tado had done, he was satisfied to pitch
the dally allowance of hay and grain over
the high fence.. The elk had become ac
customed to this style of feeding, say the
park people, and were not ready for their
old friend and keeper when he went down
to-day; to give them their grain. !
According, to the . bereaved brother, the
young man had heard that the big elk
was becoming/ugly, and he wanted to re
new; his. acquaintance with his old com-'
panlon. Sunday was the regular keeper's
day off, so young Purtado decided Â¦ he
would go to the inclosure and once more
take care of his pets. â¢ .
The inclosure runs for several hundred
yards across^the park: It is wooded and
on all sides the rail - and barbed wire
fence keeps the inmates within bounds.
The elk have been in this park for sev
eral years. On two occasions the big bull
has butted down a section of fence. Even
then the keepers had no difficulty with
the freed animal. He submitted to be re
penned without any fuss.
Leslie Spencer, the 14-year-old boy, who
was Furtado's companion at the paddock
resides at Peralta Park, Berkeley. He
was not employed at the grounds and only
joined the young keeper in the visit to
the inclosure out of -curiosity. He said:
. "It was. just after Frank had gone into
the corral with the hay and 1 1 - with the
grain- that the big elk started for him.
Before Frank had a chance to move he
was knocked down and the elk had caught
:him,with his horns.- Then, with Frank on
his antlers, the big animal started on a
; wild run around the inclosure. Frank
was dangling. over the elk's head, but he
wasn't crying or making any noise at all.
He must have been knocked senseless.
Then the elk went at him. - â¢.--- -.:
"The elk tore ; around the place, making
strange snorts and gasps. I? was a couple
of minutes before he threw Frank over
the fence. ... : .
:'.'I went after -help, but before I found
anybody another boy who had seen the
trouble had attracted \ the attention of

Mountain. Rantz and McLean dressed the
wounds of the men. Their condition is de
clared to be extremely serious and it Is
doubtful If they can recover. . -
During the melee the young women ran
ecreaming to the shelter of nearby trees,
and the two men had an open field . for
battle. Notwithstanding his severe wounds
Tall opened fire on his antagonist. A
charge of shot caught Smith on the side
of the head, tearing away the flesh. An
other shot shattered his shoulder and he
fell to the ground. - *â¢ -
Ac 3 o'clock this afternoon-Smith, while
in the company 'of Â¦ three" flaujchters of
PÂ«ter Cola of Nevrtown, -met Tall on the
road. A few angry words were -exchanged 1 ,
and before Tail could swing his shotgun
into play. Smith had turned loose a pistol.
One of Smith's bullets struck Tall in the
hand and another passed, through his arm
and entered the body.
Two years ago a neighbor's hog: was
killed, and Smith accused Tall of having
maliciously ended the animal's lif^. | The
accusation was quickly resented and since
that time the most desperate "sort of feud
has been on' between the miners.
The persons whose lives may terminate
as the result of the bloody battle are Ed

both past middle age and for many years
have resided In the mining region about

WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.â The Senate
will devote its principal attention this
week to the Philippine tariff" bill. It is
the purpose of Senator Lodge, who Is in
charge of the bill, to keep it before the
Senate persistently until it is disposed of.
He does not count on final action for some
time. It Is not the principal purpose of
the friends of the bill to debate it, but the
attacks which will be made upon it and
upon the entire administration of Philip
pine affairs inevitably will bring replies
from many of the Republican Senators.
It is understood that a majority of the
Senators on the Democratic side of the
chamber will be heard on the bill before
it Is passed. Among those who will speak
early are Senators Carmack, Money, Tel
ler, Culberson, Turner, Patterson. Jones
of Arkansas and Bacon. Senator Lodge
will eeek the earliest opportunity to have
the amendments recommended by his
committee formally adopted, but probably
will not press these when Senators are
prepared to proceed with set speeches.
Senator Nelson will take advantage of
every chance to have the bill creating a
Department of Commerce considered, with
the hope of obtainng action on it during
the week if possible.
The House leaders have made no pro
gramme for the work of the present week,
as there are no measures of importance
pressing for attention, although the anti
oleomargarine bill and the Hill bill for
the exchangeability of gold and silver are
both on the calendar and may be taken
up before long. Thus far no exact time
has been fixed for either of these meas
ures, and the lesser bills will take their
chances as opportunity presents itself.
There promises to be considerable time
to spare during the week, as there . are
no appropriation bills ready to fill the gap
when bills of a general nature are lack
ing. '
The chief interest of the week, centers
In the opening of hearings by the Ways
and Committee on the reduction
of war revenue taxes. The committee
will give to-morrow to this subject, hear
ing the beer Interest In the morning and
the tea Interest in the afternoon. On
Tuesday the committee will return to the
subject of Cuban reciprocity, hearing
more of the representatives of beet sugar
and also several Cuban planters, -who
have come to the United States to pre
sent their views. *

LONDON, Jan. 26.â The Stock Ex
change continued fairly active during the
past week. The large oversubscriptions
to two million pounds in local. loans in
dicated a large supply : of . investment
money, while the general Â¦ purchases have
been upon a larger scale than for some
months past. The reduction in the bank
rate of discount has helped the situation,
insuring the comparatively easy condi

to come.
The predictors of the boom . In home
rails have been rather at
.the dividend announcements "and this
section of the market has been decidedly
flat. But conservative critics point - out
that this may be taken as a rather
hopeful symptom, since traffic has been

BERLIN, Jan. 26.â The Boerse during 1
the past week was characterized by the
strength in all- Government funds - and
fixed interest bearers. The tendency in
industrials was mixed, iron remaining
strong, while coal shares and most of the
other Industrials lost several points.
Coal shares were depressed by the con

In disposing of the output. The coal
syndicate declared yesterday that It was
impossible to sell all the ,coal produced
bv the syndicate's . mines, although . ; the
curtailment, of the output was being rig
idly enforced. . .
The quotations on iron . shares im
proved through further evidence that the
business situation had bettered.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.â Though Prince
Henry of Prussia will stop at the German
embassy while in Washington, he will be
the guest of the nation during his stay
In this country. This means that all his
expenses will be paid by the United States
Government. To provide the necessary
funds for his reception and. entertainment
a provision appropriating $40,000 has been
inserted In the urgent deficiency bill. This
Â«um is to be disbursed under direction of
the v Secretary of State. It will be used for
the settlement of carriage, lodging, rail
road and other bills which will be in
curred in consequence of the visit of the
Prince. _,
In making this appropriation Congress
has acted in compliance with the request
of the administration. The secret fund of
the State Department has already been
drawn upon for various incidental ex
panses, and a portion of the remainder
must be set aside to pay the expenses of
the special embassy which will represent
the United States at the coronation of
King Edward. The balance could not have
stood the payment of the bills for Prince
Henry's entertainment as well.
In the cities which the Prince will visit
the best accommodations obtainable must
be obtained for him. The train which will
convey him on his tour will be special and

No treaty of alliance between Germany and the

KING EDWARD'S selection of the
Right. Rev. George Gore for the

It was announced to-night that Morris

Abram S. Hewitt, Alexander E. Orr, Wil

William K. Vanderbilt will give a lunch
eon on February 23 to Prince Henry at
Sherry,;s. The gentlemen mentioned are.
for this function, known as the reception
committee of commerce and industry. The
luncheon was arranged in the belief that
it would please the Prince to meet men
prominent in business life. The invitations
will be limited to 100, and they have al
ready been sent out.
NEW YORK, Jan.. 26.â Representatives
of the various German societies of New
York City met this afternoon to further
consider plans for the reception of Prince
Henry. It was decided that there should
be a torchlight procession on the evening
of February 2&â the same evening on
which the newspaper men of the country
will meet the Prince at dinner. It is an
nounced that Dr. von Holleben had given
his sanction to the, procession. It is esti
mated that more than 30.000 marchers will
be in line, and Prince Henry will review
the parade from the building of the Arion
Society, FiftyTninth street and Park ave
nue.
probably will consist of an engine, two
passenger cars and one baggage car.
Since the announcement of the coming
of the Prince diplomats in Washington
have been quietly making inquiries to as
certain the effect upon the administration
of the overture of Emperor William. One
of these gentlemen said to-day that so far
as the United States was concerned he
was satisfied that no political results
would follow the efforts of the Emperor.
â¢ "The United States Is naturally gratified
that the German Emperor should so os
tensibly single it out for such an unusual
demonstration of friendship," he said,
"but I think the common sense of your
officials prevents them being blinded as
to the real value of the protestations.
"William is erratic, and, friendly as he Is
to-day to the United States, he Is likely
to overturn all the good that Is being ac
complished by an unfriendly act _three
months hence." . - '" " "

King Edward, annoyed by the bitter ob

making a disturbance.
NEW YORK, Jan. 26.â Right Rev. I*Â»K,
Coppin, who sailed from this city about
a year ago on the Umbrla to take charge
of the Fourteenth Episcopal Diocese of
the African Methodist Episcopal Church
in South Africa, returned by the same
ship, arriving here to-day. He is from,
Philadelphia and was the first bishop sent
out by the African Methodist Episcopal
Church to take charge of the diocese,
which lies south of the Zambesi River and
comprises two conferences, the South Af
rican and the Transvaal. Said he:
I found plenty of work awaiting me when X
got out there. The two conferences were map
ped out but were not organized and only a.
start had been made in their development. WÂ«
now have between forty and fifty churches es
tablished, with more than 100 traveling minis
ters. We have recently bought a large build
ing In Cape Town, where in February next we
will open a school to prepare students for *
collegiate course. We are also hoping soon
to start Industrial and literary schools near
Bloemfonteln. modeled after the same general
plan as the school at Tuskegee.
We are seriously handicapped In this project
by the unsettled condition of the country, on
account of the war. There seems little hope
of the terrible war cloud lifting. You cannot
conceive the condition of affairs over there. The
Boers are gradually beln? wiped 'off the earth.
It is no longer war. but a process of slow
extermination. England will never listen to any
arbitration proposition which means restoration
of the republic and the Boers will accept- no
other settlement. Just as long as they are able
to keep up the guerrilla method of warfare they
can notwithstanding the smallness of their
number, keep thousands of soldiers In the field
busy watching them and trying to head then
off.
Bishop Coppin will go from here te
Philadelphia, where he will remain two
months. _.>, .. Â¦_' \ -!r*c'i './!*' v^*.'-- . .

LONDON, Jan.,28.-A report sent h*
Lord Kitchener, In Johannesburg, tells of
the important capture of General B. Vil
joen. In the neighborhood of Lyndenburg,
Transvaal Colony, as well as the captures
of small parties of Boers elsewhere.
The capture of General Vlljoen, who
was General Botha's most able lieutenant
and who has given the British a deal of
trouble, has created lively satisfaction in
London.
The National Zeitung concludes a page
editorial on the friendship between the
United States and Germany In these
words:
The only object of the visit of Prince Henry
to the United States is the cultivation of this
sentiment. The German Emperor could give
the United States no better proof of the feel
ings and sentiments animating him and ' the
German people In regard to the greatness and
development of the Union as a civilizing power
than in sending his brother there. Prince
Henry goes. aÂ» it were, as the interpreter of
Germany's friendship for the United States. He
is the first German Prince from the old reign
ingr house who treads the Â«oll of the great re
public and undoubtedly his acquaintanceship
with the most prominent men of the Union
-will exercise a beneficial effect upon national
relations. .
The visit of Prince Henry must dissipate all
Proof of German Friendship.
The entire German press shows irrita
tion over the allegd British attempts to
throw suspicion on the policy entertained
toward the United States by Germany be
fore the outbreak of the Spanish-Ameri
can war. Nearly all the German news
papers regard these alleged attempts in
the same light as does the Deutsche Tages
Zeitung. Dwelling upon the motives
which actuated the interpellation of Hen
ry Norman in the House of Commons on
January 20, that paper says:
In the Ixmfion report* cabled to ICew York
it is alleged that Germany was the instigator
of a plan to bring about intervention by the
European powers against the United States.
Vhis Is a direct blow in the face of truth. But
Â¦what of It"? It mig-ht. perhaps, on the verge
of Prince Henry's visit, create 111 feeling In
the United States, in which case the object
underlying Mr. Norman's interpellation and
the answer thereto of Lord Cranborne. as well
as that of the inventions sent abroad by Eng
lish newspapers, would be fulfilled.

The Prince of Wales visited the Prus

perial Chancellor, the various Embassa
dors and other distinguished personages
this morning. Soon after 10 o'clock Em
peror William and the Prince drove in a
closed carriage to the barracks of the
First Royal Dragoons, Queen Victoria's
own. A triumphal arch of evergreens had
been erected in front of the porch of the
barracks and the regiment was drawn up
in parade order. The band played the
British anthem after the regiment had
marched past the Emperor and the Prince
of Wales, who later proceeded to the regi
mental messroom. where luncheon was
served. The party Included the British
Etnbassador to Germany, Sir F. C. Las
celles, and his staff; Princes Albrecht and
Wilhelm EHel-Friedrich and Prince Hen
ry of Prussia. The luncheon terminated
at 3 o'clock. Emperor William returned to
the castle and the Prince of Wales took
a train for Potsdam, there to visit the
Duchess of Albany and to lay a wreath
upon the tomb of the late Empress Fred
erick.
In the evening Emperor William and
the Empress gave a dinner party to the

BERLIN. Jan. 26.â To-day passed with
out any disrespect being shown to the
Prince of Wales, who arrived here yes
terday evening to represent King Edward
at the celebration of the anniversary of
the birth of Emperor William on Monday.
German crowds have a too deeply abiding
respect for royal personages and are too
thoroughly policed to ever Jeer them. But
in a city where the lifting of one's hat is
as universal as ordinary civility, it was
singular to see the passing crowds with
never a hat raised and to hear no mur
murs of applause.
ThÂ© last experience abroad of the Prince
of Wales was his departure, among thun
derous cheers, from the shores ol New
foundland, while the streets through
which the Prince was obliged to be driven
to-day, on his way to visit the British
Ambassador, were without one single Brit
ish flag.
While receiving the most elaborate at
tentions from the family of the Emperor
and from German officialdom, the Prince
of Wales must feel the chilling attitude
of the German public. Almost all the
newspapers refrain from editorial com
ment on bis Â¦visit.

Against an executive policy of that kind there
should be a protest not in Iowa only, but through
out the Union. These criminals, secretly pardoned,
did not often return to their homes, we are told.
They went .elsewhere. Strangers in a strange land
without money and with a criminal record behind
them, it is fairly certain a good many of them are
now menacing society, in other States Governor
Shaw by relieving Iowa of the duty of maintaining
them in prison has imposed upon other communities
It is none too much to say that the surprise outside
of Iowa is fully equal in intensity to any that exists
among the people within the- State. In the first
place, it is surprising to outsiders that such a whole
sale prison delivery could have been carried on dur
ing two years without the Iowans knowing anything
about it. As an explanation of the prevailing igno
rance on the subject 'the report goes on to say: "It
was the Governor's policy to .refuse the newspapers
access to the pardon records, urging as a reason that,
publicity attending the release of a convict would
handicap his efforts to reform. 'Unless the prisoners
released returned to their former homes, as was not
often the case, no one learned of the action. *: * *
Twenty-two prisoners convicted of murder were re
leased. The following figures show what were the
crimes of some of the others who were released: Of
fenses against women, 38; fraud, 20; manslaughter,
14; forgery, 18; perjury, 5; -embezzlement, 4;
burglary, robbery and larceny, 128."
SECRETARY SHAW upon retiring from office
â¢ as Governor of Iowa made publyTthe names
of 473 prisoners to whom he had extended ex
ecutive clemency, within the last two years. The dis :
patch announcing the fact states: "To the majority
of Iowans the release of more than 90 per cent of the
prisoners came as a complete surprise, and in many
quarters a strong protest is heard."
EXECUTIVE CLEMENCY.
I wonder if Dolly Madison would be
able to compete favorably nowadays with
Mrs. . Roosevelt in being- queen of social
affairs at the White House. Surely those
palatial drawing rooms have not been so
brilliant at any time since Dolly Maai
son's reign until Mrs. Roosevelt took up
her present position with such grace and
geniality, and to think that she is at the
same time sensible! That Is something
most important In the first lady of tEe
land, for we are bound to follow in San
Francisco whatever pace she sets in
Washington. A few of us are getting
brave enough to appear in dinner Jackets
because Mrs. Roosevelt said it was not
practical to sit in decpllete through long
dinners unprotected from breezes from
electric fans. If Mrs. Roosevelt has made
a practice of bringing the expense of her
clothes within 5250 a year she has out
lived that day, for we read of her appear
ing at one function in a regal robe of
ccrded silk decollete and en train, with
showers of frou frou flounces about the
feet; ornaments, gold necklace and
diamonds. Then the next day In pink
panne, again in mouseline de sole and
other lavish creations that grace Mrs.
Roosevelt, but put economy far into tha
background.
If the debutantes continue to become
more and more Irresistible at those Pre

else was going to appear In it: Miss Kate

gown, while Kathryn Robinson was even
more attractive than ever in cream batiste
over white silk. Elsie Sperry, always
beautifully gowned, wore a -white xnous
seline de sol creation over white silk with
fine lace. But while there were also
gowns in many delicate rainbow tints,
white was most in evidence.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The Earle Shipbuilding Company at Hull recently became
financially crippled, necessitating suspension of work, it was
All the above vessels are fitted with Belleville boilers. The
coal consumption, it will be noted, varies greatly, which may
be duÂ«j either to the quality of coal or to experienced or ineffi
cient stokers. The Albion's poor showing is probably due to
the latter cause. . , .-
Light but general rains, extending . from British
Columbia to Lower California, have ' greatiy im
proved conditions in California. All talk of crops
drying up or failing to sprout has ceased. We need
still more rain, however, to give us the normal sup
ply, as we arc considerably behind last year's record.
What we need is a good old-fashioned southeaster
or two to put us on Easy street so far as the general
crops arc concerned. With these later on we will roll
up another prosperous year. Otherwise there is
little to note in trade conditions, and as no com
plaints are heard from any quarter the inference that
the State is doing well is natural. But human nature
is never satisfied, and no matter how well we aÂ«-e do
ing we ahva)'s want to do better. Man is built
that way
As far as the staples are concerned but little cha.nge
is. manifest. Iron and steel continue firm, though
the demand is hardly as eager. The car shortage is
being slowly remedied, and there is less complaint on
this score. -New England is beginning to complain
of insufficient margins of profit on print cloths and
similar textiles. Raw wool, however, rules firm, with
a continued good demand.' Eastern shipments of
boots and shoes are still larger than list year, the
gain thus far in January being 11 per cent, which
ought to satisfy the manufacturers. The decline in
sugar appears to have been overdone and the mar
ket has developed renewed strength during the past
few days. There is also more buying of provisions
at Chicago, though coffee has broken again at New
York. The open winter at the East has enabled
builders to do more than usual at this time of the
year, and stocks of lumber are accordingly smaller
and the market is firm, while recent heavy snows in
the lumber regions have stimulated logging opera
tions. Railroad earnings are still running ahead of
1 90 1, while from all parts of the country come reports
of a very large distributive trade, the demand for re
tail and jobbing account being reported immense.
The West continues to send in the best reports, but
even the South, which has lagged behind other sec
lions for months, is now reporting improvement.
Thus it will be seen that the general business of the
country is still in first-class condition, with nothing'
in sight to cause any apprehension. )
The hesitation is best seen by the bank clearings,
which, though 1.2 per cent larger than during the
corresponding week last year, were smaller than dur
ing the closing weeks of 1901. That is, the aggregate
of the money changing hands through bank channels
was less, showing reduced business. At the same
time practically all the leading cities show an excess
over last year, week after week. As long as this gain
is kept up an occasional pause is a good thing. It is
a breathing spell, a halt on a mountain top to look
over the country and locate the chasms and preci
pices before continuing the march. It is financial re
connoitering, and as necessary to trade as military
reconnoitering is to an army. It often averts disaster.
the line. Speculation has ceased to be rabid and
operators in Wall street, on the Chicago Board of
Trade and at other leading exchanges in the country
are showing more caution. There is also less disposi
tion to inflate prices for all sorts of commodities
to the danger point. The passing of several large
syndicates into the hands of receivers since the turn
of the year and the collapse of several large specula
tive operators at Chicago and New York have been
accepted by the financial and commercial public as
tips to go slowly. It is beginning to be seen that
the admonitions of the great bankers last year were
wise. They said the country was traveling too fast,
and it was. They said that there would be a pause
later on, and there is. Not that there is any serious
check to the volume of trade, or especial stringency
in money, for neither condition exists. There is
simply a growing tendency to- take legitimate profits
without pinning any abnormal risks, and it is a good
thing.
THE lull in business mentioned a week or ten
r days ago was even more pronounced last week.
There is now more or less hesitation all along
SOME HESITATION, IN TRADE.
Thirty-one vessels of all classes Â¦ passed through their steam
trials and were added to the effective list of the British
navy last year. This number embraces six battleships of 85,900
tons, collectively; four armored cruisers of 48,000 tons, col
lectively; one third class cruiser, of 2200 tons; three sloops j of
3210 tons, , collectively;, thirteen torpedo-boat destroyers, 'of
about 4000 tons, and three tcrpedo boats of 540 tons, making a
grand total of about 143,850 tons. The trials have, in the main,
been . satisfactory and given results exceeding the calculated
speeds. In the appended table giving the principal data of the
steam trials of battleships and armored -cruisers, those vessels
indicated by an asterisk had, their speeds taken by log, while
the other speeds were taken by .runs over a measured mile
course. The trials were under full power and eight hours*
duration: . . . , ' . ".
SIX battleships of 84,000 tons and ten armored cruisers of
' 119,600 tons were launched during 1901 for the British
navy. Of .this fleet four battleships, Corn
Â¦ wallis, Duncan,' : Exmouth and Russell, 'of. 56,000
tons, collectively, were - built at private yards, while
the Albemarle and Montague, of 28,000 tons, collectively,
.were constructed at dock yards. The armored cruisers Good
Hope, King Alfred and Leviathan, of 14.100 tons each, and the
Bedfordand Monmouth, of 9800 tons, were built by contract.
The armored cruisers Bachante and Euryalus. of 1200 tons
each, the. Drake, of 14,100 tons, and the Essex and Kent, of
9800 tons each, were built in dock yards. Fifty-six and one
quarter â per cent of the ships and nearly 58 per cent of the
tonnage was built. by contract, leaving a very fair proportion
as the share to the dock yards. Of smaller vessels, exclusive
of destroyers, the sloops Fantome, ' Merlin and Odin, of 1070 tons
each, were all built in Government yards. . , .
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
. Progress on ship building for the United States navy Is de
cidedly slow and unsatisfactory. The three battleships, Maine.
Missouri and Ohio, contracted for in October, 1898, to be com
pleted In June, 1901, have only progressed 78, 54 and 43 per Cent
toward completion In the order named. The four monitors,
also contracted for to be completed in March, 1901, are only ad
advanced from 77 to 92 per cent. Six protected cruisers, to be
delivered in June, 1002, range from 72 to 20 per cent in com
pletion, and sixteen destroyers and nine torpedo boats, which
are from two to three years behind time, are still in the hands
of the contractors. Eight submarine boats, to be delivered last
year, are nearly twelve months behind completion. Of tha
five "battleships contracted for in February, 1901, to be com
pleted in three years, no work has yet been done on two, and
only slight progress with the others. The six armored cruiser3
range from nothing up to 13 per cent, and no work is reported
on the three protected cruisers contracted for in April, 1901, to
be delivered in three years.
The Prlnz Adelbcrt, armored cruiser in the German navy,
which was launched last June, has hitherto been described as a
sister ship to the Prlnz Heinrich, but latest advices show quita
essential differences. The latter Is 8868 tons. 15,000 horse power,
20% -knots speed, and carries a battery of two 9.4-inch, ten
5.9-lnch, and ten 3.4-inch, while the Prlnz Adelbert is of 9043
tohsj 17,000 horse power. 21 knots speed, and carries fou^ 8.4-
Inch, ten 5.9-lnch and twelve 3.4-inch guns. The Krupp armor
belt is four Inches mixfmum thickness, and that of the' lower
deck side four inches, extending for a length of 215 feet. Tha
protective deck .is two inches and the gun protections six
Inches to four inches. The ship has triple screws, fourteen
Durr boilers, 1500 tons normal coal and 1700 tons bunker capaci
ty. There is a marked 'absence of superfluous superstructure
work, and the ship Is altogether a marked improvement upon
her predecessor completed only about one year ago.
The ship yards and engineering works of Schichau, at Elbins
and Danzig, cover collectively 155 acres and give employment to
about 6000 persons. Both yards turn out war and merchant
ships, marine engines, locomotives and other railroad rolling
â¢stock. The yard at Elbing was established by F. Schichau in
1837. It has now fifteen building slips, and has completed dur
ing the past twenty-three years 250 torpedo vessels and cruisers. 1
The yard at Danzig, covering seventy-three acres, was estab
lished in 1891, and has eight building slips, a 120-ton shear-legs;
and the buildings, machine tools and other labor saving appli
ances are of the latest' Improvement. The thoroughness of the
navy -work done by these establishments is such that of the
many division torpedo boats built since 1894 only one boat re
quired trials extending over a period of three months, while
all the others began and concluded their official trials within
fourteen days. It is a record unsurpassed in any other coun
try. . . . N
for many years one of the leading yards in England, but dis
astrous Government contracts led to Its failure. The works
have been bought by C. H. Wilson, a shipowner who will not
bid for any navy work, and the two destroyers still uncom
pleted will be finished by the Government.

Â¦ Such in general is the new plan proposed for the
canal. 3 It comes to the Â£rbht lite" in the . day, but
should the fight between Panama arid Nicaragua end
in a deadlockat this session of Congress it may prove
an important factor in solving the problem. ;
The claims make a' good shpwing on paper. For
the construction of the Darien canal,' however, it
would be necessary to make, a tunnel for five miies
through the mountains. The. plan of the company
is to make. this tunnel 200 feet in the clear arid with
thirty-five feet of water, and they claim the work can
be done at a cost of/87 cents per cubic yard of rock
removed. , . ' # * ,
Aside from the terms suggested, however, the
statements . of the witnesses before the committee
seem to iiave made a favorable impression, and a
good deal ,of consideration, is being given to the
route. It is claimed that while the Panama route
requires a canal forty-six miles long and the Nicara
gua route a very much longer one, the Darien canal
would be but thirty miles long. It has a good natu
ral harbor at each end, while the Panama route has
but one good harbor and the Nicaragua route none
at all. The Panama canal will have many"curves, while
the Darien route would be straight. Either at Pan
ama or .at Nicaragua the canal would have many
locks, while the Darien route would be at sea level.
Of course such a proposition's not likely, to re
ceive much attention from Congress. The people of
the United States are not going to donate $50,000,000
to build a canal for a private company-., Whatever
route be selected, the canal will be built by the Gov
ernment and owned by the Government.
It appeared from replies to questions by the com
mittee that the company, while it claims to "control"
the route, has obtained neither a right of way nor
Government concessions. When asked to make a.
definite proposition to Congress they declined to do
so at that time, but said that within thirty days they,
would be able to state terms. They intimated that the
terms proposed would probably be the retention of
ownership in the canal by the company, 'while the
United States should pay :< 50 per cent of- the cost/the
payments to begin when" $io,ooojooo "worth of work
has been completed. .
The route is being advocated by "The American
Isthmian Canal Company," and those who spoke for,
it before the committee' were General- Edward W.
Serrell, consulting engineer; H. H. Adams, a stock
holder, and^Theodore Schroeder, counsel. They claim
to control a route extending from Mendago harbor
to Pearl Island, based on surveys made by Professor
Hopkins in 1840 and afterward by McDougal, Sweet,
Forman and, Rude ; \ They are reported to have
stated that they have estimates which convince them
that the entire canal could be constructed at sea level
with thirty-five feet depth of water j for a sum not
exceeding $90,000,000 and could be completed within
three years. ' '
B.Y reason of the controversy between. the sup
porters of the Nicaragua route' and those pi
the Panama route for. the proposed isthmian
canal there has arisen a renewe'd interest in-the Da
rien route. A considerable number pf-persons. believe
that route to be the best of the three, and they have
recently. presented their arguments on the subject to
the Congressional committee. They claim to be able
by the Darien, or San Bias route as it is sometimes
called, to provide a canal at sea level which will be
only thirty miles long. j . Â¦

their cheeks with artificial. pigments.; Â¦
. Upon that showing it is clearly the duty t of Con
gress to augment the powers, of the commission. If
the statutes enacted for the regulation of interstate
commerce are bad they should be repealed, but so
long as they stand they should be enforced. There is
a menace to the country when any corporation is
powerful enough to openly violate the law and go
on its way despite a decision of the Supreme Court
itself.
Finally the commission notes that the railways do
not obey even the courts when it is 'to their advan
tage to ignore them. Thus, referring to certain vio
lations of the anti-trust act, it says: "We call atten
tion to the fact that the decisions of the United States
Supreme Court in. the trans-Missouri and Joint
Traffic Association cases have produced no effect
upon the railway- operations of the country. Such
associations in fact exist now as they did before those
decisions and with the same general effect."
Another obstacle in the way of the enforcement of
the law is found by the commission in the decisions
of the courts that penalties cannot be imposed upon
corporations violating the act, but only upon their
agents. Upon that point the report says:- "The ob
ject of rate cutting is to get business and to make
money, and the corporation, if any one, profits by the
illegal act. It is the real offender and ought cer
tainly to pay the penalty."
In the face of the most flagrant of these violations
of the statute the commission is well-nigh powerless.
It is not easy to convict railways of paying unlawful
rebates, nor. corporations of' receiving them, ' for in
order to obtain such a conviction it is necessary to
show not only that a railway company paid a rebate
to a particular shipper, but that it did not pay the
same rebate to some other shipper with respect to
the same kind of traffic moving at the same time
under similar conditions. Such proof is nearly al
ways impossible. The commission asserts that "de
parture from the published rate is the thing which
can be shown and the thing which should be visited
with punishment."
The violations of the law work a positive injury to
the industries of the country. The commission says
the 'effect of the itbates is to give to those who ob
tain them "an enormous advantage over smaller
competitors located; at other points. Already these
competitors have mostly ceased to exist. These,dis
closures afford a pregnant illustration of the manner
in which secret rate concessions are tending to build
up great trusts and monopolies at the expense of the
small independent operator."
packing houses, men whose names are known
throughout the commercial world, should seemingly
be eager to augment their gains with the enormous
amounts of these rebates which they receive in plain
defiance of a Federal statute."
The railroads, however, do not stand alone in the
violation of the law. The big corporations to which
the rebates are. given share in the guilt as well as in
the benefits. The commission notes the participation
of these corporations and -, after summing up the
wrongs committed by the transportation companies
in the cases under investigation..* says: "Equally
startling at least is the fact that the owners of these
In the brief summary sent out by telegraph, of the
report there is enough to show that the commission
has been rendered more earnest by the failures of the
past to obtain the desired authority and returns to
the attack with unabated vigor. . It presents a state
ment of the unlawful relations existing between cer
tain railway . corporations and a number of large
shippers, and, referring to recent investigations, says:
"The facts therein developed are of such a character
that no thoughtful person can contemplate them with
indifference. That the leading traffic officials of many
of the principal railway lines, men occupying high
positions and charged with the most important du
ties, should deliberately violate the statute law of the
land and in some cases agree with each other to do
so; that it should be thought: by them necessary to
destroy vouchers and to so manipulate bookkeeping
as to obliterate every evidence of the transactions;
that hundreds of thousands of dollars should be paid
in unlawful rebates to a few great packing houses;
that the business of railroad transportation should to
such an extent be conducted in open disregard of
law, must be surprising and. offensive to air right
minded persons."
ONCE more the Interstate Commerce Com
mission has presented to Congress an earnest'
plea for greater authority in the enforcement
of law" and an invincible argument why , . the plea
should be granted.; Congress may ignore^ the argu-'
ment, may evade it, but cannot refute it. The com
mission has evidence to sustain its assertions. It has
proof in abundance that the laws enacted by Con
gress for the regulation of interstate commerce are
being flagrantly violated by railroads and by other
large corporations, while the commission under its
present powers is unable to do anything more than to
complain of the violation.
INTERSTATE COMMERCE.
Doubtless there were a ' good many convicts in
Iowa who merited pardon, though the courts of the
State have never been accused /of 'being
vere. When, however,: the. pardons include so^many
of the, inmates of the State prisons it is' clear
the executive clemency has been abused. The news
papers of Iowa should hereafter insist upon having
access to pardon records. Secrecy evidently does
not work for the public good. It is to be hoped that
in his new office Secretary Shaw will not follow the
rule he adopted as Governor of \ Iowa.
There can â¢ tTe' no question â¢ that' in pursuing ; the
course he did the . Governor Â¦ made a grave mistake:
The ' proportion of ..criminals to -Â¦ population in the
United States as compared with .that in other civil
ized countries having anything like bur degree of
public prosperity is in the 'nature of a national dis
grace. There are good reasons for believing the chief
cause of it is the weaknesY of the administration of
law. The police find their best efforts at suppressing
crime thwarted in many ways by the court's,.* arid it is
frequently impossible to obtain .the conviction , even
of notorious offenders.* If. now to that. weakness' of
the courts there be added an indiscriminate . exercise
of executive clemency the situation; could hardly be
made worse by abolishing law altogether.

PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 26.â Samuel Mc-
Rae, fourth vice president of the Penn
sylvania Railroad Company, who will,
have direct executive charge of the con
struction of the extensive New York tun
nel for that company under the two riv
ers and Manhattan Island, in discussing
the reports that the company will be
forced to pay exorbitant prices for prop
erty In New York for terminal purposes,
because speculators have obtained pos
session of much of the property needed,'
said to-day: .
When the Pennsylvania Railroad first began
to purchase property In New York for terminal
purposes, and before it was known what the
purpose of these purchases was or who the real
purchaser was, certain real estate speculators,
observing the activity in real estate in the.
vicinity of the proposed terminal, bought up
certain properties and secured options on others
in aMvance of the company's representatives.
When it was finally announced that the Penn
sylvania Railroad proposed to tunnel under the
two rivers and Manhattan Island, together
with the location of the terminal station, these
speculators at once placed a prohibitive value
upon the property secured by them. Being un
able to come 10 terms with them as to price
there is nothinK left to do but to secure it under
condemnation proceedings, which will be insti
tuted at the proper time. In the purchase of
the property by the speculators the prices paid
by them were greatly in excess of that paid
for surrounding and adjoining property secured
by the company, and which under such pro
ceedings will form largely the basis of value
for the property yet to be obtained, some of
which is held by the speculators. On that
basis the speculators are likely to be awarded
less for the properties held by them than they
paid for them.

Â¦ At last, worn but with flying back -and
forth, the monarch flew to the summit
of Alta- plaza,' which fronts the resi
dences of School Director Denman, Colo
nel Mendel of the Board of Works and
other solid citizens. As they looked 'out
of their windows they saw a wild rush
of men and boys for the top of the plaza.
The hunters disregarded the "keep off
the grass" signs, and had but one
thought, which was to make a capture.
Several : times an attempt was made to
snare the bird by throwing sacks over It3
head. One large boy finally succeeded in
doing this. Then L.. Doringinl of 26:21
Clay street swooped down upon the tired
eaglel while it struggled and boldly seized
its wings. That ended the hunt. Lorln
gini knew what to do. He held the eagle
a captive by Its two wings,- which he
held together above the back of the bird
of freedom,' notwithstanding its strug
gles. Lorlngini took his captive hom^
and now has an eagle to sell that was

Francisco., â¢. * Â¦ - o
Sack Thrown" Over Bird.
Not even an eagle could stand It long.
Very soon the bird side-stepped, and
then, after a preliminary flap or two of
Its .huge wings, soared upward. The
movements of the bird indicated -that it
was tired. It flew eastward over the
housetops toward Flllmore street, where
its appearance was nailed with amaze
ment by many staid citizens who were
out enjoying the weather with their
wives and children. A swarming crowd
ran along Clay street in pursuit of the
eagle and began to bombard Its . new
resting place. For a long time the bird
was chased about. At one time it perched
upon a high tin- coping to a 'chimney,
probably thinking that there it would be
above the range of. the boys. It did not
know how much they were interested in
the American eagle. .. Â¦
The first of the missiles that hurtled
over the roof edge -toward the eagle was
regarded by the object of the hunt with
contempt. The' eagltf. did' not.- deign-to
stir, but looked majestically; with , pierc
ing gaze at- far distant objects and disre
garded the small boys and all their artil
lery. Directly, however,' the boys got
the range, and then stone after stone
rattled upon the eagle's resting place,
and the fusillade beat a tattoo that was
extremely interesting to the dwellers Jn
the house and awoke the admiration of
the people for v thÂ£ ; clever marksmanship
of the juveniles. .â
Driven to Flight by Stones.
The unusual spectacle of an: eagle hunt
in the heart of the Western Addition of
this city was sufficient to keep on edge
the live interest of several hundred per
sons for quite a period yesterday after
noon. Somewhere about 3 o'clock the
eagle, whose ample _ wings measure ten
feet from, tip to tip/ swooped down 'upon'
the roof of a residence on the east side
of Steiner street, between Sacramento
and Clay streets, and, taking, up a com
manding position upon the ridge pole - of
the dwelling, calmly surveyed the
pleasant neighborhood for some time.
He did not long escape wondering 'obser
vation. Small boys at first espied the
king of the air and shouted the striking
information to other boys, equally. 1 > as
small and fully as excitable, and soon
the streets were filled with people.
When it was made to appear that the
eagle was not bent on hostilities nor"
searching for a fat baby for its Sunday
dinner, every one plucked up courage, and
then the small boys, who were now
myriad, took to their favorite pastime cf
throwing stones as natuarally as a- duck
takes to water.

The couple were legally man and wife,
but by common consent strangers except
when they chanced to meeÂ£ on the street
after the husband had been indulging in
liquor. On these occasions there invaria-'
bly would be a" flstic encounter. Through
out the strife the woman managed to re
main in possession of her. son; to. the sat
isfaction of the population. She is a hard
working, honest creature and the man Is
a "rounder"' of the worst sort, v v > Â¦
Finally it was decided; that the man and
his wife should enter a ring and fight to
a finish to determine which should keep
the boy. The fight 'came off in Gilbert
Hall, with a citizen as referee. The boy
was locked up^in a room below the hay,
ready for instant delivery to the victor, i
For three rounds the combat was inter
esting, with honors evenly divided, t The
chivalrous sports of the town, however,
wanted the woman to win, and between
the rounds her husband was given copious
"bracers" of Jiquor. After. the third round
a few jolts on the chin made him groggy,
and in the fifth he was knocked out. The
referee officially gave the decision and tha
boy to the woman. ; This ..adjustment of
thev trouble may not be strictly according
to law, but it Is safe to say that the de
cision will hold.

Sempronius. Chiarinl Bros.' fast young
courser, scored a victory yesterday in the
second round of the open stake at Union
Coursing Park that made the form follow
ers uneasy throughout the rest of the
day. Sempronius is a recent additiop to
the coursing game. His sire, Petronlus.
was well wnown as a fast one, but a de
cided lurcher. In his first course yester
day the youngster was on the cards for a
trial with V. J. Reilly's Roya! Union, a
greyhound recognized not only as a
speedy courser but one that will stay, no
matter how long the route. IÂ»yal Union
was well played for the stake, and under
such conditions tho talent was not slow in
installing him favorite. At slip time the
odds were 6 to 1 that he -would win. Sem
pronius caused considerable surprise by
taking the lead on Reilly's rapid hound,
and increased it until he outpointed him
for the flag.
Xor was this the extent of the expense
Sexppronius put the bettors to whÂ« had
played against his chances." In the third
round he beat GramercjWa 1 to 2 choice,
in a short course, and followed by out
pointing 81r Pasha, who was favorite at
like odds, in a course that was a strong
test' of ktamina. the score being 21 points
to J7. Alter this trial Sempronius was
withdrawn.
The open stake was won by Sofala, with
Black Bart runner-up. While Sofala took
the final in easy style. It Is but fair to say
that Black Bart was handicapped by
harder coursing. Three times on the short
end Black Bart brought good cheer to his
backers, beating Laay Newark at 1 to 3,
St. Helen at 3 to 5 and Miss Brummel at
l to 2.
In the special Ftakf George Sharman's
fast courser Little Sister beat EugenÂ«
Geary's Bonnie Pasha for first honor?.
The little breadwinner ran in her old-time
form and won- her trials handily. She
beat Homer Boyr the. etate favorite, in
the fourth round on the short end at 3 to
5.- The runner-up beat Narcissus at 1 to 3
in the third round.

To-day's scores, follow: .
ring target.
An exceptionally large number of marks
men "were present yesterday at Shell
Mound range. . The rifles commenced pop
ping in the morning and continued until
the gathering twilight made accuracy im
possible. The. shooting was of the usual
order and no records were seriously
threatened. The best work of the day was
done by A 1 Gehret of the Germania Club,
who made a ten-shot score of 230 on the
Only one match wa3 played in the pre
liminary round, between W. B. Collier and
H. "W. Crowell and Drummond MacGavln
and James Code. ) The latter received odds
of "fifteen," which were sunicient had not
all the balls been played to Code. Mac-
Gavin did not handle enough to keep
warm. The score was 8-6, 6-2.
-In the first round Will Alien and Frank
Stringham received a handicap of "half
tlfteen" from Dick. Adams and Frank '
Mitchell and won in straight sets, 6-3, 7-5..
The match in which Collier and Crowell
beat Herbert Schmidt and Jack Gibson
was one of the longest of the day. The
latter, with "thirty," almost defeated the
scratch men. The score in ravor of Collier
and Crowell was 6-2, 6-8, 6-4.
Sidney Salisbury and George Whipple
allowed Charles Kuehn and Leonard
Wood odds of "fifteen" and won,* 6-4, 3-6,
6-4.
Chet and Grant Smith gave Clyde Beal
and Al Kenyon a handicap of "thirty,"
and after losing the first set, won the next
two. The score was 5-7, 6-3, 6-3.
The semi-final match between Collier
and Crowell and Allen Stringham was the
longest and closest of the day. Allowing
odds of "fifteen," Collier and Crowell won,
6-2, 2-6, 9-7. In the last set the losers,
with the score 6-5 and "forty love" in
their favor, were unable to win the lone
point that meant victory.
In the other half the Smith brothers had.
an easy time with Whipple and Salisbury.
The liberal handicap of "half-thirty" was
allowed the latter, but they were not
steady enough to win out. The score in
favor of Smith and Smith was 6-1. 6-4.
The finals between Collier and Crowell
and Smith and Smith will be played nest
Sunday. The fact that these teams lead
in the race for 'the cups, and also that
they have never met before, will add to
the interest, in the match. Collier and
Crowell have . won the cups three times
and the Smith brothers twice. The latter
will receive a handicap of "half-fifteen"
from their opponents, and as young Smith
is playing almost as well as either of the
others, the match should be close.
"Pete" Smith, Kenneth Hamilton and
Frank Hooper played a round* robin yes
terday morning. Hamilton, who beat both
his opponents, won, while Smith, who beat
Hooper, was second. The scores were:
Smith beat Hooper, 6-4; Hamilton beat
Smith, 6-0. and Hooper, 6-4. .
The following .matches were played on
the park courts: Farrell and Gunst tied,
6-0, 3-6; Edward tied Baer, 9-7. 7-9; La
Garde beat -Taylor. .6-1; O. Beyfuss beat
A. Beyfuss, 6-3. 6-3; Irving tied Strelitz.
6-3, 3-6; Hall beat Strelitz, 6-3: Baker and
Lea beat xCamp and Lytton, 6-2. 6-3; Routh
and Bozart beat Gardner and Mayer. 6-0.
There will be a class singles tournament
on the park courts next Sunday..
The Davis cups tennis doubles tourna
ment played on, the California Club courts
yesterday resulted in' some of the best
handicap matches of the season. As a
result of the. day's play two of the nine
teams that took part are left to play in
the finals. These teams are the Smith
brothers and Collier and Crowell. The lat
ter played a desperate up-hill game in
their semi-final match, ana with the aid
of considerable luck, won.
Best Score of the Day Is Made

Germanias.

i Varicocele - is an enlargement of the most
vital blood vessels In man. ThÂ« function of
these veins Is to carry off waste, thus enabling
the organs to receive fresh nutrition. The dis-
ease consists of a dilation and local stagnation
of blood, from which the organs are deprived
of . their proper quantity j and quality of nour-
ishment.- Varicocele is a very common dis-
order. Statistics show that 25 per cent of the
male population are afflicted with some stage
Â¦cf the disease. We emphatically guarantee to
cure varicocele In one week at our office, or
four weeks of home treatment. We have cured
over 3000 cases 'without a single failure or un-
pleasant result. We mean by a cure, re-
establishment of nutrition of the organ, and Its
function will be restored. We have shown this
result so often .and/ can refer to so many cases
In proof of this statement . that we make it
'without hesitation or reserve. We invite cor-
respondence and the fullest investigation of
our methods.
CONTRACTED DISORDERS.
UNDER THE TREATMENT PURSUED BE-
fore Irrigations were established, six weeks
was deemed the duration of an acute contracted
disorder. If It proceeded beyond six weeks It
was considered to ' hava gone Into a chronic
condition. From statistics complied from Our
practice in the past five years, covering over
C300 cases, we can show that 10 per cent of our
patients have recovered In fourteen days or
less. It Is, therefore, equally proper to hold
that a case not entirely - cured within . two
weeks must be considered a chronic one, and
some complication has arisen for which the
patient should see a specialist. We invite free
consultation on this subject and offer an ex-
perience of over twenty years: In fact, we can
positively assert that . wÂ« have never failed to
cure In a' single Instance. ,

1 It. was learned from the. authorities at
Angel Island yesterday that they had
been notified, of Rakowski's departure
from Vancouver Barracks, and that he
would. probably reach San Francisco to
day. Â¦ .
In this connection there is a tall ser
geant on duty at the Presidio who now
proudly calls himself the longest leased
liar in the world. He leased his imagina
tion to the Examiner a few days ago, and
as the result the latter published a cir
cumstantial account of Rakowski's arri
val, an Interview with the prisoner and a
talk with his guards; one "a eergeant who
etands more than six feet." and the other
"a -private of almost equal stature."
"With such secrecy," said the Exam
iner, "was ho (Rakowski). taken to the
military prison that the officials deny that
ho is there."
Frank Rakowski, the United States sol
dier sentenced to serve ten years on Al
catraz Island for expressing his com
mendation of President McKinley's as
sassination and uttering threats against
the life of President Roosevelt, will ar
rive in this city to-day from Vancouver
Barracks. He will be taken from the train
to the Government tender General Mc-

"I knew I should be," he said, with a
deepening of the dimple that adorns his
right cheekâ that which should be on the
left has dropped into his chin. "Every
one told me that it was warm, warm,
warm, here. But everywhere I go, if
there are only three cold days In the
year, I get them. They all tell me this is
unusually cold here. I knew ltiwould be."
Otherwise Mr. Hofmann ishighlypleaaej
with his brief I California n experiences so
far and Is in excellent form. He Is amaz
ingly youthful .in appearance, .. with a
bright, boyish smile and unpretentious
manner that are very taking. His youth

mature thought and keen wit that mark
his conversation, and Jf he plays as well
as he talksâ and it -looks that wayâ thero

enough to attend his recitals. ' Mr."Hof

t combines are the order of the day. All pro

<3o not believe the association could succeed

I SAN. JOSE, "Jan. 26.â The big "packing
house recently built arid .equipped* at San
ta Clara by; the California". Cured '.Fruit
Association at a cost of about $30,000 .'will
be a. bone of contention in' thV dissolution
of tha association, which Is to* take'place'ln
the next.few months. After. the last dis
tribution of dividends, whea;it M sa'Idup
w'ards of $500,000 will be disbursed,; this
packing-house will; remain.':. Under a
forced sale it will not bring near what It
cost, and many of the growers fear that
their money has gone to . equip. ,arf up-to
date packing-house which will fall into
the hands of some *of the packers. and
which will.be a factor, after they havo
wo organization, of forcing â¢ prunes' down
close to the one cent a pound figure. Â¦
.Another assertion by the growers Is that
some of the officers of the company in
tend to: buy the building In for a mere
moiig. organize a, private â¢ company under
the name of the present association, pre
pare s the same brand of goods and reap
the benefit of the many thousands of dol

There was considerable excitement, Jn
the Chinese Theater and ' on the streets
during' the progress .of the small-sized
riot and the property: man was compelled
to address the audience and assure them
that no blood would be < spilled except In
a- mimic way by Ah Pye Tsung. ! '
When calm was restored the play pro
ceeded and. the big audience enjoyed the
art of the distinguished actor with the
long sounding name, while the "dead
heads" went away to dark corners to plot
vengeance against those who had prevent
ed them from being announced in the
Mongolian presa as "being among those
present."
The men claimed to be . cooks by occu
pation, but two of them, at least, are
known- as members of the gun-fighting
tongs. Â¦ . ' â¢
Police Officers Chapelle, . Hayden and
Bonner were forced to use their clubs in
self defense and the special police assist
ed them. The crowd of riotous Chinese
was scattered and three of the ringleaders
were captured. â¢ Yee Ylng, Louis Don and
Tee I loo fell into the hands of the police
and after being handcuffed were sent to
the Hall of Justice and locked up on
charges of disturbing the peace and ma
licious mischief. .
Â¦ Chinatown theatrical managers suffer
from as many "dead-heads" as do the'
managers of theaters elsewhere and the
'stuffers" were the cause. of. last night'*
trouble. . They made a determined ruuii
past the ticket takers and ushers when
the police were ejecting some of the noisv
ones who had refused to vacate the aislei.
.The bluecoats again. formed Into a :vflyv
mg wedge" and the aisle of the theater
was cleared. When the "dead-heads"
found themselves out in the cold they re
taliated by picking up rocks and stones
from a convenient heap and pelting the
police.
Property Kan Reassures Audience.
Some of the more boisterous Chinese
who were compelled to vacate the aisles
were ejected from the theater, and their
appearance on the street was the signal
for trouble from a mob that had collected
there, unable to secure entrance to the
theater. . >:-. .... ..- . ' , ,
So great was the. crush last- night that
the police were compelled to clear the
aisles of the Chinese theater, and then
the rumpus commenced.
Â¦ The Chinese who were driven from the
aisles I demanded their money back and
abused the money takers and ushers with
all the force of the language of Confu

The elite of Chinatown-^of the alleys

force to giVe'eclaÂ£ to the first night of
Ah Pye Tsung in a thrilling Chinese play
that was programmed to continue'nightly
for an indefinite 'period.
Every seat in the theater was taken and
the belles and matrons of -the Mongolian
quarter had as much reason to complain
Of the crowded condition of the aisles of
the Washington-street Theater as the
"400" of San Francisco's society had when
Manager Grau recently presented < grand
opera with Emma Eames and Mme. Sem
brich. - 3 .
Ah Pye Tsung has for some time de
lighted the Mongolians of New York, and
when it was announced that he was to
appear in this city there was a rush for
reserved seats at the Washington-street

Deceased was about 72 years of age and
had been- retired from active business
for some time. He leaves a widow, a son

After the Coroner's deputies had se
cured the body permission -was obtained
by the Arnold family to have It brought
to their home here, 1612 Santa Clara

But little could be learned by the-Cor*
oner's deputy 'a"s to 'the Identity of tli<Â£'
drivers who-were. seeking a race with: -
Arnold when the accident happened, They'
did not stop after the collision. It la
stated" that several eye witnesses recog
nized 'one of the horsemen as a colored
man who resides near Melrose and who
la known by no< other name than that
of "Nigger Tom."
- Several persons who witnessed the ac
cident went to the prostrate man's as
sistance and conveyed him to the office
of Dr. Daniel Crosby on the-Haywards
road, near High streets The physician
immediately saw that Arnold Was fatally
hurt, but used every effort to restore the
injured man to consciousness. Arnold
never rallied, however, and passed away
Just as his son, Frank Arnold, who had
been sent- for, 1 arrived at Dr. Crosby's

was, .through a collision with ' anothei
vehicle, thrown from his racing cart or
the Haywarda road," near Seminary ave
nue, this afternoon, and received Injuries
which caused his death an hour after tnV
occurrence. , . -
The robbery was reported to tho police
at once and two officers were detailed to
search for the thieves. Owing to the
fact that there was no light burning . in
the HiUyer residence at . the time of the
robbery Miss Hillyer was unable to get
a good view of the robbers. She was un
able to give the police any description of
the men to aid in their apprehension.
From the manner In which they pro
ceeded with their work, after having ob
tained entrance Into the house, the police
are of the opinion that they are old hands
at the game. -â¢Â».
Burglars entered the residence of Mrs.
HUlyer, mother of Attorney Curtis Hill
yer, on Pine street, near Taylor, late
Saturday night and stole several hundred
dollars' worth of silverware and Jewelry.
An entrance into the house was effected
through a window while Mrs. Hillycr,
her daughter and the other inmates of
the bouse were sound . asleep. The
burglars had evidently been In tho house
for 6everal minutes before their work in
securing the plunder awakened Miss HUl

immediately made their escape.

Ben fienfiricks and his company of come
dians in "Ole Olson" ' at the California
last night. The piece, which is .said to
be the first Swedish comedy drama ever
written, loees nothing of its attractive
uess bj' frequent performances. Hendricks
nas been playing the part of the phleg
matic young Swede with an irresistible
dialect for the last eleven years, and both
star and play seem to grow in popular
favor. Hendricks le without a rival in his
line of work, and his company Is capable
and aleo talented in the line of specialties.
Hendricks' Swedish ditties raised tha
risibles of his audience almost to the

with Miss Trabaud captured the house.

Miss Nettie Tribaud as Genie Dimple is

quartet singing by Misses Elin Syden,

There lies before us an. old Roman world to
which Paul came down and returned victorious,
a world to be won again to Christ- by the ex
ample of our- daily lives and by a thorough
knowledge and fearless yet gentle defense of
our faith. The world to-day le one in which
luxury is deified; In which wealth and amuse
ment are the crowning prizes which men are
commanded to strive Â¦fdrV'and," if need be, to
die for; in which, while good deeds are held
in esteem and almsgiving and all forms of
charity respected, faith; the supernatural vir

fit. Paul made of every convert Â«tn apostle to
carry the truth to hla unenlightened brethren
while we who are born to the faith are apt to
conceal it in a napkin and bury it in the
earth. Yet we are kings and priests as the
apostle tells us, and each of us owesj his death
of faith to the world.
The state, of the Roman world was fair
without and foul within, yet owing to this
spirit of faith which -animated him he trans
formed it into a Christian people. -This spirit
of faith has a practical lesson for all Cath
olic people, priests and laymen, for we aru
all. as the Scripture tells us by -our,; baptism
kings and priests. God has. charged us as he
did Paul to Â¦â¢deliver*' that "itwsÂ«age~ot?-Taruf to

The Spirit of Faith.
St. Paul was born in Tarsun, ,in Sllldit,
which wu the seat of learning: in his tJmt.
.The great culture In art. literature and phil
onophy and training in the Roman law that
were to . be had In hts . native town were the
influences that stamped themselves) in his if-"
ter life and enabled him to do such good work
in converting the gentiles. . He was deeply
versed in the knowledge of the old law do
that when this new Christian sect appeared he
determined to do everything in his power to
stamp- it from the earth. .
He started f6r Damascus to carry- on this
fight against the Christians. A vole* from
heaven demanded to know ..the reason of his
errand.' St. Paul asked -"who speaks?" Â¦ and
the voice answered "1 am Jesus, whom thou
persecuteth." St. Paul went to his destina
tion and to the house of the- man* whom he
intended to destroy. There he received the
spirit of the Holy Ghost and the new faith,
and a tiew world was 6pened to his vision. Â¦ lie
went forth imbued with the one idea of gain
ing the world f-or Christ. - . ,. .

To the exceptionally Inclement weather
of the last few days was doubtless clue the
very meager attendance both at -Golden'
Gate Park and the ocean beach -yester
day. Seldom has the attendance been' so
small at those resorts, always .so. much
favored by pedestrians and , drivers. Yet
had the people but known that - the sun
was shedding. Its warm smiles along; the
ocean drive and that the .wind was not
as strong there as through the city streets

The quiet of the afternoon was relieved
by the excitement on ; a run-'
away, . which, however, >. was stopped, be
fore any serious results happened by Of
ficer J. H. Cavanagh. Then: there was a
flutter of disturbance at the beach .when
two young men having a grievance to set
tle decided to draw conclusions on the
sand dunes. They faced each other.wlth
a stern determination to fight It out to a
finish, and kept a crowd Interested for
some minutes, indeed, until one. of the
combatants was "put out of business." A
cry of "Police" served to disperse the on
lookers and scare away the participants.
A district rally 1 of the Â¦ League of the
Cross was held yesterday afternoon at 2
o'clock in. Mission Parlor^ Hall; on Seven

his belief that the public would see to It
that the building would be dedicated to

pAÂ«dHE forty-ninth anniversary of the
I founding of the Young Men's
1 Christian Association in San Fran-
II Cisco was celebrated with fitting
exercises at the auditorium in the
Association building yesterday, afternoon.
A large audience was in attendance, and
on the platform ' were members of .'- the
various committees of the association, to
gether with those who participated in the
programme. Edward Coleman presided.
After the singing of "Throw -Out the
Life Line" and prayer by Rev. Frederick
W. Clampett. rector of Trinity^ Church,
Rev. George C. Adams, pastor of the First
Congregational Church, delivered an ad
dress. ' ' \ <
In his opening he referred the
Valley of the Cleft of the Mount of Olives
and likened it unto God's way of- doing
the seemingly; impossible for those who
love and obey him. In his inscrutable
wisdom the salvation of nations, as well
as Individuals, is worked out in mysteri
ous ways. The speaker alluded to the dif
ficulties that beset the path of. George
Washington in the .dark days following
the revolution, a period in which.every
thing he did or sought to do was opposed
by a bitter minority in Congress. It was
in this way that the great character of
Washington was sweetened, and it was
this which subsequently made . him the
idol of a grateful nation. Then, referring
to the association, the speaker said: -
The work of the Toungr Men's Christian As
sociation in this city has been strenuous. _ It
tvlll find the cleft in the mount and: within
1 year we will all have cause to rejoice. It
s part of the association work to suffer â¢some-
Limes under the galling yoke of a heavy debt.
[t is the makine of character to suffer. ' It
srinss out all there is in man; it strengthens,
he soul and purifies it. But the- best, thing
ibout the association â¢ is the young men, the
nanhood the strong staunch fellows who want
to live right, i While developing their muscles
in the gymnasium t they , are â¢ building up .- a
ChriBtian character that will endure so long as
life- lasts. ; The association has been, the makv
Ing of many a young.'; man, . and. It will con
tinue to. make good men as long as this mag.
nlflcent buildingi endures.
Secretary H.< J. McCoy a - brief
statement, in .which he said the member-,
ship of the association numbered 1830. He
called attention. to the fact that there was
a debt of $79,000 on the building, and- that
it was the crowning effort of- his career to.
wipe out the indebtedness during the com
ing twelve months. 'Â¦ \ He asked' all to as
sist in the work. The speaker then made
the usual announcements of -thie- Sunday
meetings for February, --at - Â¦which Â¦ Dr.
Clampett will make the addresses. ..:
