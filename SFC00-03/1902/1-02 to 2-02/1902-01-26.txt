Gok-'s bride was taken to Chin's home oa
There is no doubt that blood has been
shed plenty of times on her account. The
real inside, of .Chinatown is "dark to ua,
and .we can only surmise, for; proofs do
not 'exist. Que,Qui's beauty, we may be
sure, was at the' bottom of many a feud,
although the white man can never.ascer

their, close Iwalls. â¢
eye to financial gains, but sne was snrewd
herself, and her drinking never passed the
fine point . beyond which she would cc-ase
to be absolutely mistress of herself. Sha
was too clever a beauty for any folly of
that kind. r Â¦
When she became a free woman she
took full advantage of her privilege. She
went forth In' the streets every day, pa
rading in such garments as the Orient
alone conceives. It is said that she never
appeared in less than $5000 worth of dress.
Her blouse was always made of the rarest
embroidered silks, and the Jewelry | that
she wore was valued at hundreds of dol
lars. Her bracelets were of precious Jade
and goldâ all Chinese Jewelry is of twen
ty-four karat gold â and she had a -way. of
â¢throwing out her graceful little arms to
show them. Her plastered hair was fast
ened In the back of her neck with wonder
ful ornaments. There was a marvelous
flch, cunningly wrought of different pre
cious metals so that it glinted in the sun
like the scales' of a real fish. This was
only one of Jthe gifts of Jew Nun, who was
on her list of adorers.
The queen had still. another accomplish
ment In addition to her coquetry and her
prettiness. She could sing. Twanging
her butterfly piano she would chant the
gayest and ther 'saddest little Chinese
songs In a way that made men, even the
sphinxes that Chinese men are, laugh one
minute and sniff the next.
The proprietor of the Chinese Theatei
heard her and saw her one night at a
banquet, and the next day he 'came to old
Loo Soo with an offer. He said he would
pay him one hundred dollars a week for
the girl's services as a performer on his
stage. He prophesied standing room only.
"Your dollars are refused," replied old
Loo Soo, who, although he 16ve# the" joy
of turning an honest 'penny, nevertheless
loved his aristocracy better.-. "There Is no
class so low* as, that of the actor, save only
the barber and the undertaker.' 1 '- My niece
shall never disgrace her ancestors by ap
pearing on the stage.". ;.â¢-' -.-..#_
Therefore her,' voice was always kept
for more exclusive useâ for private ban
quets, and for rioted celebrations : such
as the opening of a new Jos3 house or
restaurant. _: No one 'thought of giving a
really,, swell affair â¢ without . her as the
guest of honor. She, was dined and wined,
In no wise differently from whiter ;bellesÂ«.
Feasts were held at tho restaurantsâ^
feasts 'where she might have â¢Â¦Â¦been \ the
only woman ; present Â» for 'the attention

feetâ for hers Had been 'bandaged only, in

There Is none to replace Que Qui. ;
So far as San Francisco's Chinatown
goes the Queen is dead. But who shall
say, "Live the Queen"? Â¦ ,',
At the end of the three days she fled.
The various owners? of the $3130 rose In
their wrath and reported her to tha
police. Enemies before, they are joined
now in a common cause of Jilt. And
handsome good-for-nothing Chin Wlnsr
Is waiting comfortably in Hongkong for
th! arrival of the steamer that will bring:
his beauty and the neat little sum on
which theyiare to begin life together.
It is said that she was on the duck
ranch In South San Francisco, the one
that lies over by the rope walk, during
the three days that she was In biding.
The duck man comes to Chinatown to
sell his goods and she had made him a
friend and a firm one Â¦while she bought
ducks.
She has gone to join- her, lover. Ha
called for China on the last voyage of
the Coptic and he was in port about tha
time that she started. She probably
made a roundabout Journey by way of
Portland. ; . -. * /
Que Qul worked matters up to the point
where she wanted them and made her
leap at the psychological moment Her
credit had grown rather bad. but shÂ»
worked it up again by borrowing small
amounts from different men and repay
ing them with conscientious promptitude.
Their confidence In her was restored and
on the day that she had appointed to
flee she emptied thefr pockets to the sum
of 53150. ";.;/
While they were plotting she was sup
porting him. A big part of the money
that she borrowed from Jim and Quong
and the rest she used to keep him dressed
in the height of Chinese fashion. He was
a devilish . handsome fellow, anyway
dressed In the clothes she bought him ha
looked like, a prince. But the merchants
never knew that he and their favorite had
so much as a speaking acquaintance, so
carefully did the two guard their secret.
Chin worked in a saloon at timesâ ha
never succeeded, in holding a poaitton
very long. He gambled away a good
deal of the money that she gave him
and he always gambled badly. He was
not a clever Eport. .
Skillfully she kept up the hopes of thesa
two and all the time plotted with her
lover. li-i'^Vi
He gave her* a banquet where 130 guests
ate all the delicacies that the market af
forded and drank champagne and lis
tened to a band and admired the queen.
She had eyes for Quong alone. She was
a flawless diplomat and her host always
reaped his reward by receiving all her at
tention.
Quong Hing is known as the masher of
Chinatown. He wooed Que Qul and lost.
Quong Hing is the little man who owns
eight stores and turns over fortunes
every year in his Importing' trade. He is
an eighty-pound man, whose small body
Is so valuable to a hostile tons that ha
goes about with , It encased la a steel
coat of mall that must^wslgh as much
as he does. He looked carefully .to tha
weak points in this armor when he began
to court Que Qui. Â»wi
Jim Wong always called her bis mas
cot. On the day that she left she gave
him advice in his lottery buying and ha
won $2000 that same night, although she
had decamped with $250 that she owed
him. Jim .Wong cannot complain, for ho
found his financial matters very much to
the good, although he would rather lose
his money an.d have Que Qul.
They are wealthy men, powerful men,
desperate men. It took all the woman's
wits to' keep them, dangling and yet avoid
the danger point. Tljey would be ready
to kill her, kill each ottfer, kill anybody,
in a rage of Jealousy when she would ln
â¢ tervene with her merry, caressing waya
and they would be happily reassured.
They never knew that Chin Wing exited.
much less that he was all the time her
chosen lover, and that she was laying
plots along with himâ plots so deep that
they have succeeded In the face of China
town's wrath and the white man's shrewd
law-preservers.
Her money and valuables came from
many sources. Jew Nun says that he
bought her $410 worth of jewelry on tha
day she disappeared â it was all in brace
lets, that she might make more flash and
Jingle when she tossed her pretty arms be
fore him. Buck Eye has spent as much
as $5000 on her in his time, but the moat
persistent of her suitors were Jim "Wong
and Quong Hing.
She made friends wherever she went.
She had a jolly word for Chinese and
white people alike. She. spoke English
easily and she won. friends with-it.
""We all alike wish to "eat," she said.
One thing* all Chinatown says of her:
She was the most charitable woman with
in Its limits. The filthy poor in Spofford
alley and In Fish alley and in Ea5$lett
alley all miss her. She fleeced the rich
without a scruple, borrowed from them
thousands of dollars that she never
dreamed of repaying, but she opened her
purse to any one in need. She visited tha
sick herself and carried them what they
wanted. She sold her jewelry once when
cash happened to be a little difficult, just
to keep a family of hungry babies from x
starvationâ they were dirty and worthless
babies, but she did not care for that.
her wedding day to come face to face with
a picture of Que Qul hung conspicuously
on the wall. She went into a rage over
It and Chin, who la more conscientious
than diplomatic, told her that he really
loved Que Qui all the time and would
have married her if he could. The bride
wet the cake of ink that lay on the table
and daubed the face of the queen, but
Chin washed the ink off and guarded the
picture sacredly after that.
There Isn't one Chinese woman in a
hundred who has any romance In her soul.
They are the pieces of household furni
ture that their country's customs have
made them. That is why Que Qui, with
the temperament of a senorita, stands out
In Chinatown's history, never to be for
cottcn, wlicre she never may be replaced.
What she pleased to do was to flirt with
all masculine Chinatown for more than
half a dozen years, then elope with a
poverty-stricken gambler.
Their purse strings, tight enough at
other times, opened wide when she ap
peared. They loaned her money whenever
she asked for It. and they bought her
Jewelry such as a queen or an actress
might covet. In a short time she had
collected enough money to pay off her
mortgage and make her a /ree woman.
Old Loo Soo sold her to herself and there
after she was at liberty to do as she
pleased, go where she pleased, marry
whom she pleased.
Not openly. She held the trump card
of beauty and she played that card for
all It was worth. She did not laugh In
a man's face when he loved her and had
money to love her with. She coaxed him
and wheedled him and teased him and
petted him and then chilled him Just
enough to lead him on . farther. She
proved to him beyond a doubt one min
ute that he was the only man who In
terested her and the next she had him
tweaking his queue in a rage of jealousy.
She had every wile that woman ever
practiced at her finger tips, and all she
wanted was the gifts that her followers
brought her.
She laughed at them.
She coon came to be known by every
one who knew. Chinatown. The pipe
mender on the corner and the fish dealer
and even the low-caste undertaker had to
gaze at her as she passed, out of sheer
admiration, although It was as a cat looks
at a king. Dealers of moderate means
eyed her at first with a gleam of hope,
but they Boon learned that it was no use.
For the merchants, the swells., the elite,
were Quarreling for her favor, quarreling
even to the point of bloodshed.
As eld Loo Soo looked . at her and
-watched other people look at her he
patted himself f6r his shrewdness. He
bad made a bargain that would be the
delight of any man on Dupont street. He
had got her for the dirt-cheap price of
?3000.
She walked forth on the street and men
eaw her and coveted.
Que Qui was the greatest beauty ever
brought from China. She was perfectly
formed and her features were as regular
as those of the ladies on the painted pea
cock fans. Her skin was smooth and del
icately yellow, like old ivory; her eyes
were Oriental, sparkling one moment and
sleeping the next; her mouth was little
and red and her nose was as coquettishly
tilted as a French poster nose.
And she has given away her smiles,
after all. Chin Wing, the lover who has
won her after her eight years of heart
breaking. Is a good for nothing gambler.
Without a cent in the world, except the
money that she has brought him. She
iiiughed at the wealth that the merchants
laid at her feet. She did what hundreds
of beautiful and romantic girls have done
the world over since time began. She
made fools of the wise and avenged them
in the end by making a fool of herself.
Nine thousand dollars is a neat price
lor a woman. And even so it was a bar
gain that old Loo Soo, the uncle, made.
There are merchants on Dupont street,
merchants who have fleeced wealthy
tourists for years past, who would give
the fortunes hardly earned in that fleec
ing for that bit of a yellow beauty. They
would call nine thousand dollars a bar
guln counter price to pay for the daily
Â¦warmth cf her smiles.
Jim Wong and Quong Hing and the
other gallants of Chinatown's smart set
are wrathy enough over the loss of their
dollars. But they would rather any day
give up their whole fortunes than lose
QuÂ© Qul. She had their hearts in the
palm of her tiny taper-fingered hand and
they knew It. She played with those
hearts and they knew that, too. And
they let her play and they .let her make
fools of them, and in tb*e end they let
her escape with their n^oney. Now they
are making a tremendous roar and call
ing for the police to avenge them.
Chinamen are men.
Que Qui has toddled on her little feet
through the streets of Chinatown ever
since 1S94, making conquests wherever
'the chose to toddle. In 1SS4 her uncle
brought her to this country direct from
her borne In Hongkong; she was 17 years
o!<3 then, and a nine thousand dollar
beauty.
C"T> KE Queen of Chinatown, after a
I career that reads like the life of a
I Parisian favorite, has bolted.
I Ner has she bolted alone. l Along
with her have gone a lover and
three thousand sweetly jingling dollars.
Jim Wong misses the familiar jingle of
some of these dollars, and Quong Hi rig
misses that of others, and there are scat
tered sums that might be accounted for
if certain fond merchants chose to tell
the tale of how they loved not wisely but
too well. There is trouble aplenty In Chi
natown and a. woman is at the bottom
Of It.

Be careful when eating to use both sides

eat only on one side. In this case the
teeth hav-> not all the same amount of ex

one side than the other.
An excellent wash for immediate use
after teeth have been extracted is made
by dissolving a teaspoonful each of honey

Laurel hall was -the first woman's club
to be founded in San Francisco. It has
kept to a small membership, not reaching
ouc # to ,the many who are always ready
to use clubs as a means to social ends,
but holding to those who were in dead
earnest in their desire to study. Dther
clubs have made themselves better
known in the matter of public activities; â¢
Laurel Hall has always 'kept to a con
servative standard of selfrculture.
So it was something of a surprise when
tt elected l'or. its president a woman who
was pretty Â¦Â¦ rattier Â¦ than. Imposing: a
woman ''whose 'youthful 'Charms had not
given wuy, Some of the wiseacres who
looked til Mrs. Brandt regarded her as
you might' regard a child wno vyas put at
the helm of a big ship. - They were-
Vralchingr for the sli.'p to go down. Â¦
Two ytars and it hasn't gone down, nor
is ther/ any prospect of its uo::iÂ£ so. The
membersâ 125 of themâ find that the club
moves so smoothly that they don't even

That is just, where I>lrs. Brandt's secret

A member of the club says thatâ a

."The- woman must nave .wonderful
tact," she says. "She never seems to be
doing , so muchâ she floes .not force any
views or theories down 'the club's throtit,
nor even attempt to; but She keeps every
thing smooth in such a quiet way that we
bartily realize that she is doing It." â¢
.Now the fact is that a club does not
keep itself smooth. \ No matter how earn
est the members,, no matter how much
they may believe they are working for
a common . cause, prompted by a com
mon "interest, there are bound to be dif

grow pretty fast into a storm. After the -
storm has arisen it is a hard matter to
quell it. â¢ The trick of the matter is to
prevent it. Â¦ .â¢_.â¢- .
Mrs. Brandt has done that time and
time again in her own way, away that
everybody envies and very few can imi

is a prejudice In favor of large, imposing

not particularly large, although she tends
to plumpness; she is not by any means

<y* BEAUTIFUL, woman loses half her
f I power of attraction if she have poor

V I able to charm if she have fine ones.
JL So important a part, indeed, do
teeth play in a woman's appearance that
history has been made by them, for have
tre not often been reminded that if one
front tooth had been taken from Helen's
mouth there had never been a siege of
Troy and the Iliad had never been written.
Some one, who takes a gloomy view of
life, tells us that the only way to secure
a. good Bet of teeth is to begin with our
ancestors, four generations back; there
are several grains of truth In this state

if ancestors have failed to do their duty
by us In this respect. As to the color, of

All decay of the teeth begins from the
outside, no such thing as internal decay
ever having been demonstrated; hence, if
the surface could be kept absolutely clean,
no decay could take place. Three tooth
brushes should always be kept on the
toilet table. One should be rather hard,
one moderately soft, while the third
should be small and round, with a curve
in the handle, so as to get into every cor
ner of the mouth, both before and behind
the teeth. In brushing the teeth the
proper way is to brush and clean them
from the gums downward for the upper
teeth and from the gums upward for the
lower teeth. By this method the bristles
go between the teeth, touching their ap
proximating surfaces. a& well as cleaning
the front and sides of the teeth. It is
not less important to brush downward on
the roof surface of the upper teeth and
upward on the lingual side of the lower
teeth, that is to say. brush the inside of
the teeth as carefully as the. outside.
They should be brushed separately, eacli
row by itself; the upward motion, which
is the proper one for the lower teeth, not
being allowed to extend to the upper
teeth, as the brush would then impinge
upon the upper gums and cause them to
recede. The teeth at the right side are to
be brushed with the right hand; those on
the left side with the left hand, the move-

You have probably been told at some

So spoke an old-school doctor the other

and for the benefit of come of the laymen

and the usual dose is sixty drops.

rapsules for Indigestionâ and the sheep
give us these, too. But in the main we
depend on the vegetable world for our
medicines."

how. the common North American toad
was often used in medicine. The live ani

with just the tiniest suggestion of the
stars and stripes fashioned in a badge for
his buttonhole.
Nevertheless, his point cf view in re
card to the government of the Philippines
is decidedly the military one, us here
given :
"I guess everybody is ready to admit
that it's a sorry business this having
possession of the Philippines, but we've
got to stay with it now. It's like having
a bear by the tail. You may not be able
to pull him down, but you can't let go.
"ii I had my way, I'd give them a
touch of the mailed fist. I believe they
srhou'.d be ru'.tu with an iron hand, wheth
er they like it or not.
"Of course. I am open to conviction on
this point. So far the Civil Commission
has been experimenting with different
forms of municipal and provincial gov
ernment. They are a fine lot of men and
they have accomplished wonders, but it
is & question whether civil government
has not been undertaken too soon.
"The Filipino doesn't love us. Hs
Oocsn't love us a bit. He doesn't know
what gratitude is. He has no sense of
appreciation, and I believe he'd like us
tetter if we dea.lt more severely with him.
The only thills' the Filipino recognizes is
for ce.
"True, public sentiment here is against
military rule. We believe everything and
everybody should have a vote, down to
cattle and horses. But there can be no
conception of self-government where less
than 1 per cent of the people can read
and write. Here the fact that a man can
read and write presupposes some sort of
general information. A man that can
read usually reads the newspaper, and if
he does nor do that he has no right to
vote. There perhaps a man can write his
name and read his prayer book, and he
is not as fit to vote as a well bred collie
dog;.
"Of course, the Filipino demands self
covernment. But because be wants it Is
no reason he should have it. If I had a.
five-year-old child that wanted to play
with a red-hot poker, I wouldn't give It
to him. If he cried for it, I'd take him
out in the back yard and spank him. And
that's What 1 believe ought to be done
with the Filipino. He ought to be spank
ed, and spanked hard.
"The success of the Civil Commission
thus far has been due to the class of
men composing the commission and the
class of men appointed by them. Politics
has had very little to do with these ap
pointments. Most of them have been made
on recommendation of army officers, the
places being given to men discharged
from the array. 1 recommended several

was there any question as to whether he
Â¦was a Republican or Democrat. If one
of these men was caught at crooked work
he'd be lifted rijrht out of. his boots. Ju&t
es eoon as there is any carpet-bagging
over thera they might as well get out en
tirely.
"One o? the most important things. I
believe, Js the matter of education. Tho
children should be kept away from Span
ish schools. Let them go to church
schools if they wish, but make them learn
English, weeding- out the Spanish as fast
as possible. The Filipino children are very
bright and quick. They acquire English
readily, and the public schools are well
attended and doing a great deal of j?ood.
"WJth a general education and good
etrlct government the problem may work
ou* ell right. I believe, however, that not
less O*an forty thousand troops should bÂ»
kept there for at least two or three years.
General "Wheaton, who I__f done more
fighting, perhaps, than any other officer
stationed there, thinks the army should
be kept up to fifty thousand.
"Self government should be granted the
Filipinos gradually, as they chow them
eelves capable of exerting It. It Is well
enough to let them choose their municipal
officers, though Jn my opinion If there
was a military form of * government It
would be better to give this generation
no power In the matter. Simply appoint
municipal and provisional officers from
among the natives and promise the fran
chise to the next generation. Thus they
would come by degrees Into self govern
ment. '"â¢;'â¢
"The men who should be dealt with
most severely are the agitators. Under a
military form of government these would

"As to the business opportunities In'the
Philippines, in my opinion the best chance
cf making money Is, in building railroads,
electric lines, or in big sugar plantatons
and the erection of large sugar mills. A
good many men have been b%ing up

as he had moved, in a line parallel with
the vanishing coach. Sometimes through
the openings a bared painted limb, a
crest of feathers, or a strip of gaudy
blanket was visible, but nothing more.
And yet only a few hundred yards away, j
stretched the dusky, silent plainâ vacant
of sound or motion!
Meanwhile the *Sage Wood and Pine
Barren stage coaci), profoundly oblivious,
âafter the manner of all human Invention
-of everything but its regular function,"
toiled dustily out of the higher plain and
began the grateful descent of a wooded
canyon, which was, in fact, the culminal
ing point of the depression just described.,
along which the shadowy procession was
slowly advancing, hardly a mile in the
rear and flank of the vehicle. Miss Julia
Cantire, who had faced the dust volleys
of t|ie plain .unflinchingly,; as became > a
soldier's daughter, here stood upright and
shook herselfâ her pretty head and fig
ure emerging like a goddess from the en
veloping silver cloud. At least Mr. Boyle,
relegated to the back seat, thought soâ ;
although her conversation and attentions
had been chiefly directed to the driver
apd mall agent Once, when he had light
heartedly addressed a remark to her, it
had been received with a distinct but un
promising politeness that had made him
desist from further attempts, yet without
abatement of his cheerfulness or resent^*
xnent of the evident amusement his; two
male companions got out of his v "snub"."
Indeed, it is to be feared that Miss Julia
had certain prejudices of position, . and
may have thought that a drummer, was
no more fitting company for the daughter
of a major than an ordinary peddler.
So Dick Boyle was obliged to' amuse:
himself alone on the back seat with those
liberal powers of observation which na
ture had given him. On entering the can
yon he.. had noticed the devious route the
coach had taken to reach It and had . al
ready invented an improved route Â¦which
should enter the depression at the point
where the Indian had already (unknown
to him) plunged Into it, and had-con
ceived a road through the tangled brush
that would shorten the distance by some
miles. He had figured it. out and believed
that it "would pay." But by this; time
they were beginning the, somewhat steep
and difficult ascent of the canyon on the
other, side. The vehicle had | not
many yards before it i stopped. Dick
Boyle glanced around. Miss Cantire 'was
getting down; she had expressed a wish to
wallttthe rest of the ascent and the coach
was to - wait for her at the 'top. Foster
had effusively begged her .to take her own
timeâ "there was no . hurry!" : Boyle
glanced a little longingly after her grace
ful figure, released from her cramped po
sition on the box, as It flitted ; youthfully
In and out of the wayside trees; he would
like to have joined her in the woodland
ramble,' but even his good nature was not
proof against her indifference. At a turn
in the road they lost sight of her, and, as
the driver and mall agent were deep f. in
a discussion about the indistinct track
Boyle lapsed Into his silent study of the
country. Suddenly he, uttered a slight ex
clamation : and quietly ' slipped from ? the
back. of the toiling. coach to the ground
The action I was, - however, quickly noted
by the driver, who promptly put his foot
on the brake and pulled up. "Wot's up
now?" he growled.
Boyle did not reply, but ran back a few
steps and began searching eagerly on the
ground."
"Lost suthin'?'' asked. Foster. :
â¢ "Found something," said Boyle picking
up a small object. "Look at that! X> â â d
if It.isn't the card I gave that Indian four
hours ago at the station!" He held up the
card.?
"Look yer, sonny," retorted --, Foster
gravely, "ef yer wantin' to get out and
, hang round Miss Cantire, why don't yer
say so at onct? That story won't^wash!"
"Fact!" continued Boyle, eagerly. "It's
the same card I stuck in his hatâ there's
the greasy mark in the corner. How the
devil did itâ how did he get here?? '..-Â¦
"Better ax him," . said Foster, grimly,
"ef he's anywhere round." : ' 1
"But, I say, Foster- 1 don't like the
look of this at all! Miss Cantire is
"alone, andâ" - Â¦â¢---. - Â¦. Â¦ - ...'-Â¦Â¦ ...
But a burst of laughter from Foster and
the ' mall agent Interrupted : him. "That's
so,"-; said Foster. "That's your best holt!.

ain't bin treatin' you- well! G'lang!"
The horses started forward -under Fosj
; ter's whip, .leaving Boyle standing there,
hajf inclined to join in the laugh. against
'. himself ,' and yet Impelled by some strange
instinct to | take * a more serious view; of
his discovery.: He resolved to remain on
the road and within convenient distance
of Miss Cantire, until she returned to the
coach; she could - not be far away. .With
this purpose he- walked -slowly on, halt
ing occasionally to look behind.
Meantime the coach continued its difflr
cult ascent, a difficulty made greater by
â¢a singular nervousness of the:; .horses,
that, only with - great *. trouble ., and some
objurgation from the -driver," could be
-prevented from- shying from 5 the .regular
, track. \ Presently ,they swerved so madly
! from some point ; of .the - thicket â¢ beside
them that ' the coach completely left the
track on the right. Luckily it .was a dis
used 'trail -'and the ground ; fairly : good,
and Foster gave them their heads, satis
fied of his ability to regain the regular
road when necessary. JQ It took some mo
ments for him ' to recover complete . con
trol ; of the - frightened animals, - and then
their . nervousness having â¢ abated with
t their distance: from the thicket and â¢ the
trail being less steep though more Â¦wind
ing "than the regular road, he' concluded
to keep ' it until he got to Â¦ the summit,
when he would regain the* highway once
more and await "- his passengers. : Having
done this, "the two men : stood up on the
box, ; and.- with an â¢ anxiety â¢ they tried to
conceal from each other, looked down the
canyon for the lagging pedestrians.
"I hope Miss Cantire hasn't been stam
peded from the . track ;by any skeer like
that," said the mail agent, dubiously.- --'
."Not she!. She's got too much Â£Tit and

with such dellberateness" and precision
that the two men,; mortally stricken; col
lapsed where they stood, hanging for . a
brief t moment - over the dashboard before
they rolled'.-' over on - the ;â¢ horses' backs.
Nor did' they remain there Jong, â¢ for the
next moment they were seized by half-a
dozen shadowy figures, and, with the
horses and ".their -cut traces, dragged Into
the thicket. â¢;â¢ A half-dozen and then a
dozen other shadows flitted and swarmed
over, in and through the coach, reinforced
by,: still more, i until the i whole vehicle
seemed to ; be possessed,' covered and hid

then as ; suddenly* at some â¢ signal they
swept Â¦ forward furiously In â¢ the track : of
the destroying ; shadows. .
'/ Miss Cantire took full advantage of the
suggestion "not :â¢ to hurry" , in â¢ her walk,
with certain feminine ideas of Its latitude.
She gathered a. few wild flowers and some
berries in the underwood, inspected some
birds' nests with a healthy youthful cu
riosity, and even took the opportunity of
arranging some moist tendrils of her silky
hair with something she took from the
small reticule that hung coquettishly
from her girdle. It was, Indeed, some
twenty minutes before she emerged into
the road again; the vehicle had evidently
disappeared in a turn of the long.' wind
ing ~ ascent, but just ahead of her was
the dreadful man, -the. "Chicago drum
mer." She .was not vain, but she made
no doubt he was waiting there for her.
There was no avoiding him, but his com
panionship could be made a brief -Â¦ one.
She began to walk with ostentatious
swiftness. - ".
Boyle, whose concern for her safety was
secretly relieved at this, began to walk
forward briskly, Moo, without looking
around. s Miss Cantire was not -prepared
for this; It looked so ridiculously as if
she were chasing him!- She hesitated
slightly, but now as she was r nearly
abreast of him she was obliged to keep

for all the world like -an absorbed and

"It would be as much as my life 13
worth to appear before Foster without
you," he said laughingly.. "You've only
got to hurry on a little faster."
But the young lady resented\this being
.driven by a "drummer." She- began to
lag. oppressing her pretty brows omi
nously. ;â¢ . # ' v ..
"Let: me carry .: your flowers,", said
Boyle. - He had Â¦. noticed that ' she wa3

skirt and the nosegay at the same time.
VNoJNo!" she said in : hurried horror
at this new suggestion of their com-
panlonshlp. Thank you very muchâ
but they're really not worth keepmgrâ I
am going to throw them away. There!"
she added, tossing them Impatiently, la
the dust.
But she had not reckoned on Boyle Â»

stooped down, actually gathered them
up again and was following: She Lur

coach first, ignoring him! But a vulgar
man like that would be sure to band
them to her with some Joke? Then shÂ»
lagged , againâ she was getting tired,
and she could see no sign of the coach.
The drummer, too, was also lagging
behindâ at a respectable distance, like a
groom or one of her father's troopers.
Nevertheless, this did not put her in a
much better humor, and, halting until
he came abreast of her, said impatient
ly: "I -don't see why Mr. Foster should
think It necessary to send any one to
look after me."
"He didn't," returned Boyle simply.
â¢'I got down to pick up something. Â¦
"To pick up something?'" She returned
incredulously. <â¢*--Â¦
"Yes.. That." He held out the card.
It's the card of. our firm."
Miss Cantire smiled ironically. "You
are certainly devoted to your business. '
"Well, yes," returned Boyle, good
humoredly. "You see, I reckon it don t
pay to do anything halfway. And what
ever I do I mean to keep my eyes about
me." In spite of her prejudice M133 Can
tire could seo that these necessary or
gans, if rather flippant, were honest.
"Yes, I suppose .there isn't much, on
that I don't take in. "Why now, Mlsa
Cantire, there's that fancy dust cloak
you're wearingâ it isn't in our line of

Oddly enough, this cool appraisement of
her costume did not incense the young
lady as it ought to have done. , On the
contrary, for some occult feminine reason, .
It amused and interested her.
"Are you in the habit of giving this in
formation to ladies you meet in travel-

"Well, no!" answered Boyle, "for that's
Just where you have to keep your eyes

It's no use aggravating a possible cus

Miss Cantire was silent. She knew she
was not of that kind, but she did not re
quire his indorsement. She pushed on
for some moments alone, when suddenly
he . nailed her. She turned impatiently.
He was carefully examining the road on
both sides. ' Â¦ .

rejoining her, "or the coach has turned

it strange we hadn't sighted the coach

"Why can't we go on as we are?"
"Because we are expected to come

that impressed her. When he added,
after a pause. "We must go back and find
where the tracks turned off," she obeyed,
without a word. â¢* â¢ - '
They walked for some time eagerly
searching for signs of the missing ve
hicle. A curious Interest and/ a new re
liance in Boyle's Judgment obliterated her
previous annoyance and made her more
natural. She ran ahead of him with,
youthful eagerness, examining the ground,
following a false clew with, great anima
tion and confessing her defeat with a
charming laugh. And It was eho who.
after retracing their steps for ten min
utes, found the diverging track with a
girlish cry of triumph. Boyle, who had
followed her movement) quite as Inter
estedly as her discovery, looked a Uttlo
grave as he noticed the deep indentations
made by the struggling: horses. Miss Can

minutes before she would never have ob

"Certainly," he said quickly, as if com

""What do you t'ht" 1 * has happened?
The ground looks very much cut up,"
she said In a confidential tone, as new
to her as her previous observation of
him.
"A horse has probably stumbled and
they've taken, the old trail as less dlffl
cult," said Boyle promptly. In bis heart
he did not believe it, yet he knew that
if anything serious had threatened them
the coach would have waited In the road.
"It's an easier trail for us, though I sup
pose it's a little longer," he added pres
ently.
"You take everything so Â£ood-humored
ly Mr. Boyle," she said after a pause*
"It's the way to do business. Miss Can

cultivate it."
She wished he hadn't said that, but
nevertheless she- returned a little archly:
"But you haven't any business with the
stage company nor with me, although I
admit I intend to get my Dunstable here
after from your firm at the wholesale
prices."
Before he could reply the detonation of
two gunshots, softened by distance,
floated down from the ridge above them.
"There!" said Miss Cantire, eagerly.
"Do you hear that?" â¢ --" J -Â¦
His face was turned toward the distant
ridge but really that she might not ques

PART I. .
THE Sage Wood and Dead Flat stage
coach was waiting before the sta
tion. The Pine Barrens mail wagon
that connected with it was long
overdue with Its transfer passen
gers, and the station had relapsed Into
listless expectation. Even the humors -of
Dick Boyle, the Chicago drummerâ and
the, so far, solitary passengerâ which had
diverted the waiting loungers, began to
fail in effect, though the cheerfulness of
the humorist was unabated. A solitary
Indian, wrapped in a commissary blanket
and covered by a cast-off tall hat,
crouched againset the wal? of the station,
looking stolidly at nothing. On one side
stretched miles of arid waste to the stunt
ed, far-spaced pines in the â¢ distance,
known as the "Barrens"; on the other an
apparently limitless level with darker
patches* of sagebrush, like the scars of
burnt-out fires.
Dick Boyle approached the motionless
Indian as a possible relief. "You don't
eeem to care much if school keeps or not,
do you, Lo?"
The Indian, who had been half-crouch
ing on his upturned soles, here straight
ened himself with a lithe, animal-like
movement and stood up. Boyle took hold
of a comer of his blanket and examined
it critically.
"Gov'ment ain't pampering you with Al
goods. Lo. I recken the agent charged
'em $4 for that. Our firm could have de
livered them to you for $2 37 and thrown
in a box of beads in the bargain. Suthin'
like this!" He took from his pocket a
small box containing a gaudy bead neck
lace and held it up before the Indian.
The savage, who had regarded him â or
rather looked beyond himâ with the toler
ating indifference of one interrupted by a
frisking: inferior animal, here suddenly
changed his expression. A look of child
ish eagerness came into his gloomy face;
he reached out his hand for the trinket.
"Hold on!" said Boyle, hesitating for a
moment; then he suddenly ejaculated,
"Well, take it, and one o' these," and
drew a business card from his pocket,
which he stuck in the band of the bat
tered tall hat of the aborigine. "There!
show that lo your friends, and when
you're wanting anything in our line "
The interrupting roar of laughter â¢which
came from the box seat of the coach was
probably what Boyle was expecting, for
he turned away demurely and walked
tov.-ard the coach. "All right, boys! I've
squared the noble red man. and the star
of empire is taking its westward way.
And 1 reckon our firm will do the 'Great
Father' business for him at about half
the price that It is done in "Washington."
But at this point the 'ostlers came hur
rying out of the stables. "She's comin',"
said one. "That's her dust Just behind
the lone pineâ and by the way she's racin'
I reckon she's comin' in mighty light."
As the galloping horses of the Incoming
vehicle pulled out of the hanging dust in
the distance the solitary driver could be
seen urging on his team. In a few mo
ments more they had halted at the lower
end of the station. "Wonder what's up?"
said the mail agent.
"Nothin'! Only a big In Jin 6care at
Pine Barrens," said one of the 'ostlers.
"Injir.s doin' ghost dancin" â or suthin' like
thatâ and the passengers just skunked out
and went on by the other line. Thar*s
only one ez dar comeâ and she's a lady."
"A lady?" echoed Boyle.
"Yes," answered the driver, taking a
deliberate survey of a tall, graceful girl
who. waiving the gallant assistance of the
station keeper, had leaped unaided from
the vehicle. "A ladyâ and the fort com
mandant's darter at that! She's ciar grit,
you bet â a chip o' the old "block. And all
this means. Sonny, that you're to give
up that box seat to her. Miss Julia Can
tire don't take anythin* less when I'm
around."
The young lady was already walking
directly and composedly toward the wait
ing coach â erect, self-contained, . well
gloved and booted, and clothed, even in
her dust cloak and cape of plain ashen
merino,, with the unmistakable panoply of
tajste and superiority. A. good-sized aqui- Â¦
line nose, which made her handsome
mouth look smaller: gray eyes, with an
occasional humid yellow sparkle in their
depths; brown penciled eyebrows and
brown tendrils of hair, all seemed to
Boyle to be charmingly framed In by the
silver gray veil twisted around her neck
and under her oval chin. In her sober
tints she appeared to him to have evoked
a harmony even out of the dreadful dust
around them. "What he appeared to her
was not so plain; 6he looked him over
he was rather short: through himâ he was
easily penetrable: and then her eyeB rested
with a frank recognition on the driver.
"Good morning, Mr. Foster," she said
with a smile.
"Mornin', miss. I hear they're havln*
an Injun scare over at the Barrens. I
reckon them men must feel mighty mean
at bein* stumped by a lady!"
"I don't think they believed I would
go. and some of them had their wives
with them," returned the young lady in
differently; "besides, they are Kastern
people, who don't know Indians as wall
as we do, Mr. Foster."
The driver blushed with pleasure at the
association. "Yes, ma'am,", he laughed,
"I reckon the sight of even old "Fleas in
the Blanket/ over there," pointing to the
Indian who was walking stolidly away
from the station, "would frighten "em out
o* their boots. And yet he's got Inside hi3
hat the business card o' this gentleman â
Mr. Dick Boyle, traveling for the bl?
firm o f Fletcher & Co. of Chicago"â he in
terpolated, rising suddenly to the formal
heights of polite introduction, "so it
sorter looks ez ef any skelpln' was to be
done it might be the other way round,
ha! hat* Â¦'-;*-
Miss Cantire accepted the introduction
and the joke with polite but pool ab
straction and climbed lightly into the box
seat. The coach plunged forward Into tho
dust, which Instantly rose around it, and
made it thereafter a mere cloud in the
distance. Some of that dust for a mo
ment overtook and hid tfie Indian, walk

from it at an angle, with a quickened

a tangled - trough-like bottom of low

DICK BOYLE'S BUSINESS CARDTHE SUNDAY CALL.

FREDERICK WARDE, accurate of
dress as ever, rolling of voice as
ever, energetic of manner as ever,
greeted me vigorously at 10 In the
morning. , :
.Then he muffled a' yawn.
It was exquisitely done beneath the
energetic manner and the vigorous . greet
ing:. It settled, the fact that Warde is "an.
actor. I xrould never have discovered the
yawn except for the keen -eye of guilt;
for I was trying to muffle my own. i. *
"This is rather early for me," he rex
plained. "I got up to meet you."
"And I to meet" you. It is a time -when
all good actors and newspaper people
should be sleeping a well earned sleep.
Can you talk about Shakespeare at this
unearthly hour?"
It was then that his eye flashed and
his breast heaved. "I ' can 'talk about
Shakespeare in any of the twenty-four
hours," he said, all vestige of the yawn
disappearing. "If I had known that was
what you wanted I could have made It C
O'clock."
He lighted an after-breakfast cigar and
settled down with a goddly show of com
fort. ' He is stout enough to appear as
thoroughly comfortable as a thfn man
never does, although Warde's embonpoint
has not reached the Joshable point. He
could play the melancholy Dane without
cartooning him. Perhaps he Jumps rope
a- la Lillian Russell,' or perhaps he
punches the bag, or perhaps he culti
vates enough worries to save his figure,
"What is this about the new Shakes
peare â the Shakespeare of to-day?" I
asked him. /

interest in the dramatist. â¢ The desire to
read and study him is . aroused, and
when *.his Is done the actor has given
something invaluable, even though lie
has created no wonderful new Hamlet or
Brutus or Macbeth.
"So the Shakespeare revival must be of
great and lasting value, no matter if It
fails to make the fame of any individual.
It shows at least the people's ideals aro
still high, In spite of the fact that it de
parts from them many a time. Thera
had been a hot demand of late for the
dramatized novel, the so-called historical
novel which is not historical; but, thank
heaven, It won't last. When the orange Is

The Shakespearean revival is a good

PECULIAR ART OF CUTTING
AND POLISHING DIAMONDS
Â»^ Y EW YORK now leads thÂ© world
/\ I In the art of cutting and pollsh
( \ ing diamonds. In the twenty dia-
V V mond cutting concerns in this city
\Â« 20,000 karats of rough diamonds
are polished each year, rather more than
the annual output of the Brazilian mines.
About 200 skilled workmen are employed
in the trade, and the bosses say that the
diamond cutters of New York now excel
those pf London or Amsterdam. The
business has practically grown up within
the last twenty years, and nearly all the
apprentices are now native born. A clever
lad beginning the trade at 15 may become
a skilled workman in five or six years.
The best diamond cutters under favorable
conditions earn from $40 to $90 a week.
These are better wages than those earned
by even the most famous foreign diamond
cutters. Workmen here are more intelli
gent and trustworthy than those of Hal
land, France or England, the chief dia
mond cutting countries of Europe. Theft
is common abroad, but ls unusual here.
Proverbial American extravagance Is
the secret of New York's lead in diamond
cutting. Foreign diamond cutters are not
permitted to lose more than 50 per cent
on each stone. Here the loss is seldom
less than 60 per cent, and often greater.
The diamond ls almost indestructible. It
loses nothing by long wearing and acids
cannot injure it. The prevalent idea that
soap and water dim the luster of the dia
mond ls a mistake. This is the dull sea
son, and the diamond dealers of London
are holding back rough diamonds with
the hope of an improvement in prices.
Ordinarily, however, rough diamonds may
be bought in this market at about $20 per
karat for small stones, say up to three
karats. Above that tne price rises by
great leaps. The method of getting at
the price is to multiply the rate per karat
by the square of the number of karats.
A ten-karat diamond often brings $2000.
A diamond weighing three karats in the
rough, and worth here $60, will, when pol
ished, weigh something over one karat
and sell, unset, at a Jeweler's at from $90
to $100. It is difficult, however, to speak
with certainty of these things, because
the diamond trade is full of tricks. No
one knows how often duties are evaded;
like bits of clear alum, thÂ© darker likÂ©
clouded quartz. The rarest and costliest
stones are of sky-blue, pink and black.
When the boss cutter has made accurate
record of his rough diamonds hÂ© divides
them into groups of four and five and
gives a group to each workman. From
that time forth the man to whom thev
are/ entrusted is responsible for thÂ«
stones. He returns them each night to
the boss and the progress of thÂ© work is
carefully noted. In this way it is made
extremely difficult for fraud to bÂ© prac
ticed. A cutter is seldom permitted to
polish a stone belonging to any onÂ© but
the boss. Doubtless the workman would
bÂ© careful to prevent confusion, but mis
takes might arise. Now and then a clever
substitution is managed, and oneÂ© in a
long while outright theft is committed.
The first work done upon thÂ© rough dia
mond Is cleaving. The stonÂ© is placed in
a peculiar cement that softens easUy and
hardens quickly. A little notch on tha
line of cleavage is madÂ© with another
diamond, the edge of an old razor la
placed in this notch, and with a smart
blow of the hammer the diamond la split.
Of course when a diamond can be worked
whole it Is not split. After cleaving comes
cutting. The diamond is placed in a llttl*
mass of cement on the end of a stick and
scraped with another diamond similarly
embedded. The cutter has six points pre
sented to him, and he begins with the onÂ©
that seems moat promising. His cholcs
decides which shall be thÂ© upper surfacÂ©
of thÂ© diamond, for in the "brilliant" cut
ting, which is the most difficult and the,
one most generally practiced here, the
CX iK? se il sur * ac Â® ls slightly flattened,
while the under side runs to thÂ© aces of
a pyramid. In this way eight or ten
facets are made. From the cutter thÂ©
stone goes to the grinder, or polisher,
who patiently turns it and turns it untli
the swiftly whirling wheel has cut upon
the surface nfty-elght tiny facets. ThesÂ«
flf ty-elght facets appear upon every dia
mond cut as a brilliant, whether it be a
ten-karat stone as broad as a man's
thumb nail or a tiny sparlc not blreer
than two pin heads. ThÂ© wheel on which
the stones are polished is a soft iron
disk, lined with innumerable curved rays
running from center to circumference.
This is sprinkled with diamond dust and
which will seat 250, three section-rooms, a
tearoom and kitchen. Throughout the
rooms are handsomely furnished and so
arranged as to admit of effective decora
tion. A library is being collected, while
many fine engravings, etchings and pieces
of statuary are already the property of
the club.
The Ebell Club is perhaps the most pro
gressive of the Los Angeles clubs and
puts to good use these cozy quarters. *
Still another clubhouse is now In course
of construction in Los Angeles, which is
expected to be finished in time for the
biennial. This will be known as the^
Shakespeare Club and is being built by
Mrs. Addle Murphy Grigg on Figueroa
street, within a few blocks of the Wo
man's Club house. The upper floor will
be used by the Cumnock School of Ex
pression, of which. Mrs. Grlgg is principal,
but the rooms below will be adaoted for
club purposes. Here the Ebell Club will
find a new home, as the rise in property
.values makes it impracticable to hold the
Greek temple permanently. The Shakes
peare Club has also leased the clubrooms.
The building wlil be in Elizabethan
style, heavily crossbeamed, with spaces
filled with plaster, wide gable window's
and latticed panes and a tiled roof. The
plans show wide fireplaces, low ceilings,
with uncovered beams and low window
seats; Jill in quaint old English style. An
old-fashioned English garden will be made
a feature of the place.

The clubhouse was built especially for
the Friday Morning Club, the most influ
ential of the women's clubs In Los An
geles, by the Woman's Clubhouse Asso
ciation. The building is free from debt,
and aside from the lease of the Friday
Morning Club a considerable income is
derived by renting the clubhouse for re
ceptions, balls and entertainments of va
rious kinds. The eighty stockholders of
the association count on a 5 per cent divi-
The furnishings of this beautiful club
house are in keeping with the structure.
Persian rugs carpet the polished floors,
quaint antique tables, couches and chairs
relieve the severe outlines which are the
feature of the mission style, and the sand
finished walls are richly tinted and hung
with rare paintings, engravings and etch
ings. Indian draperies, old brasses, bronze
vases, busts and bas-reliefs and many
other objets d'art have been donated to
the club and serve to give the apartments
an air of culture and elegance.
The audience room has a seating capa
city for six hundred. Here, too, the ceil
ing is timbered, and the lighting Is from
windows quite under the roof. Upon the
ipper floor are banquet room, kitchens
ind dressing rooms, ample for all pur
poses of entertainment.
The interior Is equally artistic. A
broad hallway leads to the assembly
room, and to the right and left are re
ception rooms, library and omces. The
v.-ood finish is weathered oak, which is

and massive Tuscan columns and broad

amid the merriment of the rest of the
company, who knew Hoffman's dislike at
being made a butt.
Theater parties, which are now so fa
vorite a- form of entertaining one's
friends, were not known in San Francisco
until late in the sixties, unless an excep
tion is made in the case of one given by
Judge A. C. Monson, who died last week
in New York at the ripe age of fourscore.
Judge Monson was a law partner of'Mil
ton S. Latham in Sacramento prior to
that gentleman's election as Governor of
the State; he was the great beau of thÂ»
capital city and noted for his inability
to. pronounce the letter R, On the occas
ion referred to Judge Monson brought
down a party of a dozen friends on tl<Â»
steamer from Sacramento to take In ths
first appearance of James Anderson at
the American Theater, their entree creat
ing quite a sensation. Miss Kate Baldwin f
daughter of Judge J.G. Baldwin, and
afterward the wife of John'B. Felton an>
early day legal luminary of the San Fran-
Cisco bar, was tho beauty of .the party.
About 1868 a young man from Boston
who cut quite a swath as a society beau
here, 'John M. Glldden by name, may bo
said to have inaugurated "them by glvlntr
a theater party of fifty guests at tho
operatic performance of Mme. Parepa
Rosa In "Linda dl Chamounl," at the Met
ropolitan Theater. .The entire party
which consisted of the very cream of tha
society of that day, wero driven after the
performance to the â¢ residence of Mrs
Lloyd Tevls on Taylor street, the having
placed her house at the disposal of Mr
Glldden for a cotillon, followed by guD
pe- -'-.'Â¦:. .
ductlon of the play here, was sufficient to
scare ladies from patronizing it. and the
night It was first seen at Maguire's, in
April: 1SG7, men only filled the seats, not
a woman being present. It was not such
a. dreadful thing after allâ in fact it was
so "good". It was a: comparative failure.'
'One of the excitements of the day was
the arrival of the lightning express train
which brought Lawrence Barrett and hi3
party to play "Henry V." Rignold
had been originally, engaged to play
tho part at the California, -but when he
broke the engagement and went to tha
Grand Opera-house (or Wade's, as it was
then called) to play that character, the
management of . the California tele
graphed for Barrett, and the trip across
the continent was made In the then won
derful time of four, and a half davs. Bar
rett was a. nervous man,. and he after
ward said that sooner' than return Ea3t
at the same rate of speed he would walk
the entire, way. \ ., â¢â¢â¢;, . . .-'
The arrival, of the party was made the
occasion of a great demonstration, guns
were lired, a 'banrt of music - played in
, the court-yard of the Palace Hotel, where
a. breakfast was given. - at^which Mayor
Bryant presided and speeches were made
by ail the notables present. As a conse
quonce the opening night of "Henry V"
at the California June 5*. 1S76. was a jam.
But in spite of the excellence of the per
formance there were many funny sights
that provoked smiles in the audience. The
costumes of Henry V w'ere made for
Rignold, who was a. much larger man
than Barrett and the King.'s crown kept
slipping down over Barrett's nose; the
logs of his armor were several inches too
long, making it appear as' if he were
walking on short stilts; his^royar mantle
swept the ground as he uncomfortably
moved about the stage, and as a kisser
Barrett was not a success. Much of this
was remedied after the first performance,
but the play after a comparatively short
run was withdrawn.'
A scene not down on the bills occurred
at the -old "California Theater in- August.
1-673, when there -was a benefit" given- and
Steve Masf-ett'was ono of those who vol
unteered. It must be remembered that
John. McCullough, who was at that time
the lessee of the_ theater, had been a
protege of Edwin Forrest and was '.for
many- years his - leading man. Masseft,
who gave "imitations," had in his reper
toire one of Forrest, which vras more of a
burlesque than a personation. Thi3 he be
gan on the occasion in question, but when .
McCulloug-h learned what was going on*
he ordered the curtain lowered, which
was done in the middle of Massett's per
formance.
It is only of recent date that theatrical
and musical celebrities have been re
ceived socially by the swim. There have
been, however,- exceptions and among
them_ may be -cited the dinner â¢ given by
Mrs. Ben Holladay Sr. to Lawrence Bar
rett, In 1868, and the numerous suppers
at which Heller, the magician, figured as
star guest. . .; . ; .
Heller came well supplied with letters
to our best people," a good, many of whom
invited him to supper, parties after his
evening performance, at which he very
obligingly did a number of sleight-of-hand
tricks. At one of these parties,- given by
Judge H. A. Lyons, there was a scarcity 1
; of spoons suddenly noticed, whereupon
Mr. Heller commenced to draw them from
Judge. Hoffman's pockets, collar of his
coat and even his shoes, much to that gen
tleman's, embarrassment and final anger,
audience. Another funny sight about this
period anu even later was to see Charlev
Schultz. who was leader of the orchestra,
drop l:!s i baton -and fly from the house at
the first tap of the fire bell to join the
company to which he belonged, he being.
a most enthusiastic fire laddie

'Â¦woolly West cannot" compete In s^me

tolerated, and a greater proof of thlS" as
sertion cannot be cited than the way in
which little. Eliso Holt, the English ac
tress, was, received on her first appear
ance at the California in .August. 1SÂ£>.
It was during the ; onsra^einont of the
veteran actor, John Brougham, at that
house, and on tho evening in question the
theater had seldom hold a more brilliant
r.iuliercp.-t.be occasion being the benefit
offered by Mr. Brougham to Neil Warner,
v.'ho appeared- as"Sir Giles Overreach In
"A New Way to Pay Old Debts." sup
ported by Brougham. McOullough, Ray

Crocker and Emilie Melville. The second
part of the programme was a burlosouo
callfd . "I.ucrezia- . Borgia. |tM.' P.. or La
Gi-andc Doctreps."' A great . retmtatlon'
had preceded EliseHolt, and curiosity to
see her "was at fever heat. When she
danced upon the stage.'however,'cos
tumed as in -the accompanying photo
graph, society caught its breath and in -
less than five minutes all those ladies who
could get out of the house had disap
peared. It Was only those whose seats
were at the Inner end of the horseshoe
who remained. Her costumes were - con- '*
sidered immodest and the house the sec
ond night was a dead frost.
Under these circumstances, Lawrence
Barrett deemed It best to cancel the en
gagement. He requested Miss Holt to
make some changes in the "business" of
the play; and when she refusedthe parts
were called in and the California saw her
no more In abbreviated skirts. Apropos
of risque plays, the reputation of "The
Black â¢ Crook." which had such a run In
New York and which preceded the pro-
It was net long ti'.! Garrtsorr heard of
the fun and naturally he wished to hear
the joke himself, but every. night hewent
to the theater Birch heard he was in the
house and omitted it. So one nisht Gar
rison wont early and hid himself behind
the curtains of the box while some of
his friends. occupied the front seats, but
when the time came for the question,
"Where have you been?" and it was
asked, Billy Birch deliberately turned
around in his chair and looking up' at
the box sa!d, "You think I don't know
you're there, don't, you?" whereupon a
perfect yell went up, Mr. Garrison ac
knowledged himself beaten and gave up
the attempt to hear himself laughed at.
Anything like this might be consldsroJ
impossible at this date, but it must be
remembered that San Francisco was a
much smaller - jiiaee then and nimest
everybody in a theater knew everybody
else.
It was at the Metropolitan in ISM 'thit a
rather curious coincidence occurred. -Dan 1 '
Eetehell. a popular young; comedian, came
hero the year before and played engage- ;
monts at different theaters extending
over a period of nine months, going from
here to Australia in February, 1SC3. At
his farewell benefit a few nights before
he sailed one of the characters in the play
of "Dombcy and Son" had occasion to
read from a newspaper about the loss of
a ship at sea. In doing so he interpolated
the name of the Trieat. the baric which
was to take Setchell away, saying: "Noth
ing was saved except a trunk filled with
a stage wardrobe and bad plays," a joke
which was received with much laughter,
by the audience. The Triest sailed but
never reached its destination, and wreck
age bearing that name was picked up
nearly a ye3r afterward off the Leeward
Islands.
The opening of the California Theater in
January, !SC3, under the joint manage
ment of Lawrence Barrett and John Mc-
Cullough. was a gala event. These pen
tlemen had gathered around them a com
pany unequoledj in including
many who aftorward became stars aÂ£
greater or less magnitude, as for instance
John T. Raymond. Frank Mayo. E. J.
Buckley, Willie Edouin. and others. ThÂ»
Opening performance was on January 18;
1WS. and long before' the eventful* night
there was not a scat to bo had In the
house for love or money. Barrett in lull
evening dress "received" the audience <n
the lower hall of the theater as they en
tered, and when the curtain rolled up lor

liant audience ever . assembled ; in San
Francisco before or since â orchestra, dresa
circle ar.d family circle were crowded with
people known In the world of fashion,
even the gallery holding a fair proportion
of those unable to get scats elsewhere
The play was "Money," McCullough tak
ing the part of Alfred Evelyn, and a cor
dial â¢ reception was given to all the play
ers as they appeared; but. during the first
entr'acte something occurred tc bring
down the house with a roar.
The orchestra was playing the popular
"Anvil Polka," and thinking the music
too pood to be lost Mrs. Dr. Shorb and
Ben Holladay Jr., who with several oth
ers occupied one of the Btage boxes
(which was an exceptionally large one

In the background to the frantic delight
of the gallery and Intense amusement of
the rest of the house. On being discov
ered they withdrew behind the curtains'
and when they, reappeared after the cur
tain went up on the^second act they were
greeted with three cheers and a tiger.
John Raymond, who was one of the
company, had a mania* for matching: half
dollars, and on more than one occasion
he was seen to match them during: the
"business" of his part with friends in the
TwatÂ» t&trarfl the olos* of the fifties
I that Mrs. John Wood, an English ac
j tress, played a long engagement at
X Ilaguire's Opera-house and created a
great sensation. She was a beautiful
woman. As a burlesque actress she had
few 'equals and her small voice she man
agsd with consummate skill. The play in
which she made the greatest hit was one
written for her in San Francisco by M.
Mi. Noah, entitled "Love's Disguises." in
which she took the part of a young girl
masquerading as a youtb. She numbered
her adorers by the score and probably the
most open In his devotion at her shrina
was Judge John S. Hager, at that time
a gray middle-aged bachelor. He occupied
one of the stage boxes at Maguire's every
night and always at the close of the first
act a single white camellia was dropped
from it at the feet of the fair actress,
who Â¦wore it In her hair or in her corsage
the rest of the evening.
Judge Hager presided over ono of our
district courts and Mrs. Wood thought
Bhe would turn his devotion to account by
obtaining his assistance to get a divorce
from her husb:ind, John Wocd â as ugly a
little man as qne could llnd In a day's
Journey. The sttit, founded or. intemper
ance, was accordingly brought jr. Judge
Kager's court and there it dragged along
until thÂ» close of the theatrical season,
wben JV. etc Hagrer, hard-hearted man, to
every one's surprise, decided against her.

,ower this sound had over tho com

they got home all right. Wonwn In those
days were riDt so independent as they are

"The Art of Teaching," by Emerson E.
White, is a comprehensive inquiry Into
the general principles which underlie the
best methods of teaching. While not be

.particular method of instruction, it will
prove a helpful guide to young teachers
who have not learned from experience
how to develop most successfully the tal

of effort on the part of teacher and pupil.

Whether wet wood,, damp or dry." -

Yet we pitied the pcor devil
Who would sell a stove so cheap.

On a scorching summer's day:
Sixty pounds It weighed, plus stovepipeâ
Yet we sniggered all' the way.
So that evenlnjr we lit her,
And we watched our beauty burn !
Till the heat within the cabin
Gave my partner there a turn â
Made him deathly sick at stomach â
And I scorched my only shirt ,
While I watched our beans and bacon
Lest our victuals should be hurt. t
Tou bet she was a hummer!
But she hummed too much for us
On those blazing days In summer,
And we'd stand outside and cuss. -
And we'd take our grub and eat it

manner. Soon afterward she is wooed
by a young man of fortune. Francis Bel

der to save her father from impending?
financial ruin. Bellamy does not pretend
to love Margaret, but expects to find in
her a suitable head to his household. He
is a dissipated fellow, who has run un

ries he stipulates that his wife Is to leave
him alone to follow his own inclinations.
So Bellamy goes his way and > his wife

spite of himself, a potent influence. He
falls in love with Margaret and tries to
lead a life which will meet with her ap

"The Outlaws of Horseshoe Hole," by
Francis 'Hill, is a story of Montana in the
early days, when the respectable settlers
had to protect themselves by lynch law
from the depredations of desperadoes.. The
young hero of the story, Allan Sayers, is
a lad whose father owns a cattle ranch.
While guarding a part of his father's
property, Allan is captured by a band of
outlaws, who steal many of Mr. Sayers'
horses. Allan finally makes his escape
and returns home with his tale of woe. A
party of men from the ranch set out with
Allan to recapture the horses. Both
horses and outlaws are found, but the
latter make their escape, after capturing
Allan once again. ..This time Allan is com
pelled to spend several months in the com
pany of these men, but at last he gains
his freedom through the kindness of a
daughter of the chief bandit. The end of
the story contains the account of the final
punishment of the outlaws. Although
the book deals with the wild life
of early days In the "West, It Is not sensa

culties which men of respectability had in
maintaining law and order in communities
Â¦where there was a strong lawless element.

Upon this time, with Its promise of bet

unrest. He has felt fired .to perform some
Â¦wonderful deed, which will testify to the
Crowing development in his character;
but now he feels Eteal upon him the be
cumbing influence of a dissatisfaction
wltn any condition to which he may at

self and all things, he cries:
"I'm sick of it! I'm eo cramped here on

was taking place within him. for the greater
part of his sensations and thought were beyond

laid itÂ« grasp upon him: then it seemed to him
that Fate was playing with him, h&d blown him
out of his place, and was now carrying him
through the air like a feather. He began to
feel farry for himself, and went to his wife.
Sometimes he did not wish to do this, consid
ering that frankness toward her would lower
him in her eyes, but he went nevertheless. He
arrived gloomy, and now in a vicious, again
In a skeptical mood; he went away, almost al
ways, petted and composed. His wife had

were simple, but there was always a great deal

Into the life of Orloff, with its sordid
&Â£Â£Â« and lack â¢ of opportunity, comes a
chaÂ»gÂ«. He and his wife are offered the
position of attendants at a hospital. In
the doctors and nurses of this Institution
Orloff and his wife, Matrena, for the first
time meet with people who consider work
a means of ennobling life rather than a
cause of its degradation. Orloff and Ma
trena catch the enthusiasm of their new
acquaintances and do their best to win
approbation by a strict attention to duty.
Gradually the two develop into something
better than they have ever been. Their
self-respect increases, and as a conse
quence their reepect for each other is in
creased, while their love is lifted to a
higher plane. Soon Orloff finds himself
talking over with his wife the ambitions
and desires which until now have not
risen above the level of his consciousness.
To quote from the story itself:
"OrloU and His Wife" is the story of
two poor creatures, who live in a cellar
tn a wretched neighborhood. The man is
a. shoemaker. He and his wife spend all
the day at work in their mi set able room.
They love each other, but the monotony
of their existence at times' lÂ»ads them,
through an instinctive craving for excite
ment, to fight together like wild beasts.
Orloff in particular is conscious of vagus
but powerful yearnings for something
different from all that he has hitherto
known. As far as externals go, his life
nas been but little removed from that of
an animal. He cannot flnd happiness,
or even contentment. In a life which, if
sordid, is tranquil. Young and strong, he
feels Burge -within him an energy which
must have something upon which to ex
pend itself. Untrained in directing this
energy except in the insignificant require
ments of his trade, it escapes all his fee
ble efforts at control and finds an outlet
In the Infliction of physical injury upon
the person nearest at hand â his wife.
This mental or spiritual unrest is the
chief cause of the tragedies enacted In
most of these stories. The rebellion of
the soul against the narrow limits of its
material environments finds its most ter
rible significance when it is felt by those
whose hard fate it is to have no knowl
edge of the suggestion Is offered by philos
ophers toward a solution of the problem
of being.
THOSE who made the acquaintance
of Maxim Gorky through the Eng
lish translation which was made last
year of his novel, "Forma Gor
dyeeff." vrill expect to find the collection
of his short stories, "Orloff and His,
Wife," a group of powecfuliy written
tales. All of these stories reveal the in
tensity of feeling which has inspired the
Â¦work of the best Slavonic writers. In
this book Gorky describes the primeval
passions ' which rage in the Russian so
fiercely, and often with such tragic re
sults when they are unchecked by the
quieting influence of culture. For nearly
ail the characters in this book are of the
cenus "tramp," a knowledge of whom
Gorky gained at first hand uurinc his own
experiences of vagabond life in Russia.
The hypersensitive reader will not find
this book altogether agreeable. The pict
ures of life which it presents are drawn
with that fidelity to truth which seeks ac
curacy of delineation, with no care for
the sensations of the spectator cave the
Â¦wish to have him see the thing portrayed
In its "art condition. When this spirit
animates the historian of that part of

to show the Tartar through a very th n
veneer of Russian the picture preren'cd
Is bound to be one which good â¢workman
ship alone can make attractive. Withou;
the employment of the graces of style,
these stories are written with a power

snake them seem like .ancient dramas in

"Men With Pasts" Is the history' of a
group of men whom the world has used
ill, and who have used the world ill. An
ex-soldier of unenviable reputation rents

a tavern for vagabonds. Th$ story" de
scribes the peope who collect there until
there comes a time when the proprietor is
carried off to prison. Some of the dwell
ers in the hovel are clever men, but all
have turned - whatever promise was In
them Into a cunning which Is exercised
merely in supplying the means of prolong
ing: a worthless existence. They spend
much of their time in exchanging views
upon subjects which interest them. These
conversations are written with a skill
which makes , them revelations of, the
motives actuating the conduct of crea
tures who possess natures such as theirs.
"Up to this point I had thought that Kono
valoff had been changed by his vagrant life,
that the excrescences of 'sadness which were
on hid heart during thf first period' of our ac
quaintance had . fallen 'away from him, like
a busk, from the actbns of the free air which
he had breathed during those yean; but the

had been born, to its misfortune, with a sensi

people in Russian life, and they are ail more
unhappy than any one else, because the heavi
ness of, their meditations is augmented by the
blindness of their minds."
" 'Well, so far as you are concerned, I say
it again,' continued Konovaloff. 'Don't you

Â¦Well. I think you must have read books

some sort of work; if there isn't any work,
you ask for bread, and you'll get it In that
way you'll tee a great deal of the world, at
any rate. â¢ â¢ â¢ All sorts of beauty.'
â¢ â¢ â¢ 'Oho!'â the little Kusslan shook his
head â "if we could only manage to gret a fur
coat, or a warm hut for the winter, we'd live
like lords.' â¢ â¢ â¢ He screwed up one
eye and looked at Konovaloff with. a laugh.

"Â±4.onovaloff" is a pathetic story of a
journeyman baker. This man is a hand
some, noble fellow, an adept at his trade.
His character has one grave defect,
which in the end proves fatal to him.
He is subject to terrible fits of despond
ency against which he is powerless to
struggle. During them he loses all care
for his work and enters upon a season
of dissipation, which is ended only when
he has spent everything of which he is
possessed. Then Konovaloff, for such is
his name, goes to work again. He re
mains sober and industrious until he feels
himself once again in the grip of/melan
cholia. Kanovanoff does not know how
to read, yet he has a passion for books.
He pays a fellow-workman to read to
him certain stories which he has grown
to love. The tales of the noble deeds of
heroes fire his soul, while the injustice
-with which some of them meet arouses in
him rebellion against the harsh decrees
of fate. Always a sensitive, thoughtful
fellow, what Konovaloff learns from
books serves to make him brood the
more upon the inequalities of social con
ditions and the mystery of existence. In
a. moment of despondency Konovaloli.
commits suicide. For some time before
this he has led the life of a tramp. It
is during his life as a wanderer that there
takes place the scene in which Konova
loff himself gives a hint of the reason
for the failure of such lives as his:
"So you sen, Maxim Cavvatievltch. It ralseil
me up, and then dashed me down. So I never
performed any heroic deed. Even to this day,

which would set me above all men, so that I

And say to them: 'Ah, you reptiles! Why do

I thought, when I got rid of Matreshka: 'Come,

A lit of anger so Intense as to amount
to temporary madness seizes upon Or

the hospital, who send him from the
place. He leaves Matrena and goes off
alone. Some years are supposed to

OJCB cf the raort pleasSnr evidences
of the progress in art culture In
RÂ«ti Francisco is the fact that the
owners of almost all the fine resi
dences recently erected have availed,
themselves of the art of either painter
or scu]j>tor to enhance the interior dec
oration. Many of these homes have
beautiful mural paintings or ceiling dec
orations", but to Charles Ackeiman be
longs the distinction cf having obtained
the first and as yet the only sculptured
Interior frieze in this city- The Acker
tnim residence on the comer oX Van Xess

a fine specimen of artlstio architecture,
was designed by M. J. Lyons, architect,

fects of color and ornamentation. The

(portions of which, are here illustrated).
tires modeled In bas-relief and nearly
life size- Their seml-nudlty allows the
sculptor a fine opportunity to display his
well known ability in delineating the
human form. Although the layman may
admire the effects in this completed form,
only an artist can appreciate the diffi
culties that have been bo ably worked
out to bring that result. Every figure Is
instinct with life and energry and yet so
low are they modeled that in no place is
the relief more than three Inches in
height.
On the north wall Is portrayed the
spring, in the center panel of which is
the Goddess of Spring (Fig. 1), flanked
on either side by male flgurea represent
ing 1 youthful Fans. Surmounting the
buttresses, to the right and left of the
center panel and over the mantel are
satyr heads. The beautiful conception
of harmony and love is deftly carried out
by the artist. In the spring panel to the
tlful pastoral scene, the motive' of the
three panels on this northerly wall being
essentially that of youth and bounteous
nature. These three panels are united in
design by a background in which one may
discern a fine suggestion of a landscape,
Â¦whish Is carried around the entire room,
forming a connecting link With the vari
ous panels and gradually changing its
aspect as one season merges into the
next. Turning from the nor^h wall to the
east wall we behold the depiction of the
summer season. The one to the left of
the central panel shows the 1 .harvester
and his wife (Fig. 4) before' a primi
tive altar offering 1 up their thanks for a
bountiful harvest. On the other side of
the central figure in this summer scene
are shown the reapers (Fig. 5) "at work.
In ;he center of this group Is shown the
open book cf life, which will be re
ferred to later on. â¢
Turning to the southerly wall the
ts tipholsiered In red leather, which forms
a rich contrast to the massive black oak
woodwork, above which at a height of
eight feet from the floor the frieze ex
tends around the room for a distance of
ninety feet. This frieze, which Is the
Â¦work of Kobert L Altken, the well known
eculptor cf this city, is symbolical of the
four ecatons of life. The entire frieze
contalr.3 upward of twenty or thirty flg-
right of the central figure parents and
children (Fig. 2) are disporting in mirth
ful dee, while at the side of the elder
child is seen the crafty and agile chetah,
one of the fiercest of the beasts of the
forest, and yet which has beentrained to
domesticity, * and with gentle and placid
spirit Is mingling- in the ball-tossing
sport. On the other panel composing, the
spring group (Fig. 3) is depicted a beau-
autumn ecene Is shown, ..which has for Its
motif the grape. (Figs. 6 and 7.) Here we
find the figures more mature in form and
appearance, and the apple blossoms of
spring have been replaced by vines. - In
the center of this autumn scene is por
trayed the harvest moon. (Fig. 8.) On the
westerly wall is the winter scene (Fig. 9),
in . which a mother bending . over
a sluggish fire of wood nestles ;Â¦ to ' her
breast her ; little chlld,r while near .by an
elder ; child' is stirring the dying embers
into a blaze. > In this ; panel we find the
one fully draped figure,, that of the moth
er... In the center of the. winter panel the
artist has presented the book of life, now
closed. ; These ,; two | panelsâ the \ book of
life opened and closed, : one set in the sum
mer scene arid j the other in the | winterâ
stand in strong contrast and facing each
other. (Figs. 10 and '11.) They represent,
respectively, the .fullness, of life and the
bitterness of death. In each panel the
center is occupied by a small winged idol.
In the summer group this figure holds' In
his hand the open tablets of life., On.the
sides are, . respectively, .; a male and' a j fe
male figure, each holding aloft an Infant
as if in thankfulness to the. god of life.
On ' (he opposite lid* of Â¦ the winter panel
is reproduced the three main figures,
those" upon .the sides bending in sorrow
and despair over funeral urns, which rest
upon the altar in front of the idol, who
now with bowed head clos,es In silence the
book of life and clasps It tightly to hi a
breast. In refined conception and poetic
imagery these two panels have rarely, If
ever, been excelled in - sculpture. Taken
as a whole the effect of the frieze, is one
of striking beauty and richness. Its cost
liness, however, -will probably preclude Its
like being reproduced In many homes.
. The mechanical work of tinting: and
. bronzing alone took three men more than
: four months, while the work of modeling
in clay occupied Mr. Altken's. time for a
much longer period.
Art connoisseurs who hare Judged this
frieze say that It will tax Altken's genius
to the utmost to create a more splendid
production.
A NOTABLE EXAMPLE OF HOUSE DECORATION"For two hours before sundown the ket-'
tie tenders is howlin' an' callin' the dance
throughout the Osage camp. Thar's to be
a full moon, an 1 the danceâ the Ingraska
it isâ a dance them Osages buys from the
Poncas for eight poniesâ is to come off in
a big, high-board corral called the 'round
house.'
"Followin* the first yell of the kettle
tenders, the young bucks begins to paint
up for the hilarity. You-all might see 'em
all over camp, for it's August weather
an the walls of the tents an' tepees is
looped up to let in the cool, daubin' the

brews trouble for Bill; he gets up ag'inst
the agent.

he's good an* dead, an' all without no

is. I partakes of that dog â some. I don't
nacherally lay for said repast, full tooth
ed an' reemorseless, like it's flapjacks â I
don't gorge myse'-f none; but when I'm in

Utes. Otherwise I'd hurt their sensibili
ties; an' I ain't out to harrow up no en
tire tribe an' me playin' a lone hand.'
"That agent questions Bill as to them
â¢war-dance carryin's on of old Black Dog.
Then he p'ints at Bill's blankets an'
feathers, an' shakes his head a heap dis
approbatif.
" 'Shuck them blankets ah' feathers,'
says ,the agent, 'an' get back into your
trowsers a whole lot. Be plumb sudden
about it, too. I puts up with the divers
an* sundry rannilcabooisms of old an'
case-hardened Injuns who's savage an*
ontaught But you're different. You'v*
is, Crooked Claw goes curvin* off to war,
joyful, at first. Later, he says, his glee
is a heap subdooed because of the big
chances he's takin'. ' Then he lugs out
'leven skelps, all Ute,- an' elooMdates.
" 'This yere first maverick,', says Crook
ed Clawâ of course, I gives him in the
American tongue, not bein' equal to that
reedie'lous broken Osage he talksâ "this
yere. first maverick,' an' he strokes the
braided ha'r of a old an' smoke-dried
skelp, .'is easy. The chances that a-way
is even. Number two, of course, is twice
as hard; an' when I snags onto number
threeâ I downs that hold-up over by the
base- of Fishers Peakâ the chances has
done mounted to three to one ag'in me.
So it goes on, gettin' h\jher"an* higher,
ontil when I corrals my 'leventh, it's
shore 'leven to one he wins onless he's
got klllin's of his own to stand off mine.
Which I don't reckon none he has,
though,' says Crooked Claw, curlln' his
nose plenty contemptuous. 'He's heap big
squaw â a coward; -an' would hide from

Oeage, plumb strong financial, ' with a
bunch of cattle an' more'n two hundred
ponies. . Bill pets his first glimpse after
he -comes- back from school of this yeio
lovely Saucy Willow at a dance. This
ain't no war,dance, nor any cer'mohious
splurge; it's merely a informal merry
makin'. all innocent an' free, same as Is
usual with us, say, at the Wolfviile dance
hall. â¢ Shore, them Osages lacks â¢ guitars
an' fiddles, an' thar's no barkeep nor nose
paint â none, in trooth, of them fav'rable
adjuncts that makes a evenln' in Hamil-
hor'zontal about . a foot high from th*
grass, * in the center. The orchestra Is a
decrepit -buck with a rag-wropped stick,
who beats the drum, chantin' at the same
time a highly pensif. refrain. Mebby a
half dozen squawd, with-no papooses yet
to distract 'ern. sort o' camp3 'round this
yere vlrchewoso with the ra?stick, an*
yoonites their girlish howls with his. No,
you-all can put down a bet- it don't re
mind you none of nightingales or mockin*
birds; but them savages likes it. Which
,they- simply seems- to. wallow In said
warbljn's! But to me, they're more calc'
lated to loco a henhawk than to furnish
inspiration , for a dunce.
..' r 'Tunk! tunk! tunic! tunk'' goes this
yere rag-stidc buck, ! while the squaws
chorus along in with 'Hy-yah! hy-yah!
hy-yah-y'ah-yjih! . Hy-yah! hy-yah! hy
yah-yah-yah!' an' all plenty grievous, an'
make no mistake!
"AtÂ»the first 'tunk!' the bucks stiffen to
their feet an' cast off the blankets. Fea.th
crs, paint, an' bells! they bjaze an' tinkle
her only dream of life is to show the
coyotes what vocal failures they be.
â¢^It's a week after this yere Ingraska
dance an' Bill's fam'ly.hold a round-up
to pick Bill out a squaw. He an': present
none, bavin' the sense to go squanderin
off to play Injun poker with some Osage
sports he hears has money over on Grey
hoss Creek. Bill's family makes quite
a herd that a-way; | bucks an' squaws
buttin' in on the discussion permiscus an
indiscrim'nate. Shore! the squaws has as
much to say as the bucks among Injuns.
They owns their own ponies an" backs
their own play, an' is as big a Injun as
anybody, ailowin' for that nacheral dif
ferance between squaw dooties an' buck
dooties â one keeps camp while the other
hunts â or war times, one protects the
herds an' plunder; while the other faces
the foe. You hears that squaws is slaves?
However is anybody goin' to be a slave
where thar's as near nothin' to do -in the
Â¦way of work that a-way as is possible
an" let a hooman live? Son, thar ain't
"But we're strayed from that weddin.'.
Bein' now re-arrayed in fullest feather,
the Saucy Willow is fetched into the ring
an' given a platter of chuck with the rest.
They eats awhile. Then one of the bucks,
lookin' about like he's amazed, says:
'Wherever is the Jack Rabbit?' that bein'
Bill's Osage title. But Bill ain't thar
none. Crooked Claw shakes his head, an*
puts it up most likely Bill's rummagin*
about loose some'ers, not knowin' enough
to come in an' eat. At this a brace of
bucks an' a young squaw starts up an'
reckons they'll search about an' see It
they cuts Bill's trail. They goes out an*
thar's the imbecile Bill settin* off on a
rock a quarter of a mile, with his back
to the camp an', the footure. that a-way.
The two bucks an' the squaw, who makes
up the explorin' expedition, herd3 Bill into
camp, an' stakes him out, shoulder to
shoulder, with the little Saucy Willow
Neither Bill nor the little Saucy Willow
su'gests by word, screech or glance that
they saveys whatever is the game or the
stakes, an' eats on, takin' no notice of
thurnse'fs or any of them gluttons who
sorrounds 'en. Both Bill an' the HtTle
Saucy Willow looks that witless an' sim
ple, you-all would shorely yearn to bat
'em one with the butt of a mule whip if
you're only present tcr be exasperated by
sech exhibitions. At last, however jest
as the patience of the audience is plumb
played, both Bill an' the little Saucy Wil
low gives a start of surprise. Which
they re pretendin' to be startled to find
they re feedin' off the same dish/ Thar
you be; that makes 'em 'buck an' squaw*
â'man an' wife' ; an* ycreaf tor. in Osage
excloosif circles, they can print their
kyards , Mr. an' Mrs. Bill Connors,' while
Bilr draws an spends the little Saucy
Willow s. annoolty on payment day la-,

"At last the big feed begins. Son, you
should have beheld them besotted Osages
throw themsets upon the Crooked Claw's
good cheer. It's a p'int of honor to eat
as much as you can; an', b'arin' that in
mind, them revelers is shortly entitled to
credit a whole lot. They mows away
about twenty pounds of beef to a buckâ
the squaws not bein" so ardent, quits out
on the repast with mighty- likely it's the
thirteenth pound. Old Tom Sixkiller
comes plenty clost to sacrificin* himse'f
utter. ;.*,v
"This last I knowsâ I'm knockin' about
Pawhusky at the timeâ for the next day
I sees the medicine men givin' some suf
ferer one of them aboriginal steam baths.
They're on the bank of Bird River.
They've bent down three or four small
Baplin's for the framework of a tent like,
an thar's piled on 'em blankets an' robes
a foot deep, so she's plumb airtight.
Thar's a fire goin', an' they're heatln'
rocks, same as Colonel Sterett tells about
that time when they baptizes his grand
father Into the church. When the rocka
Is redhot they takes 'em, one by one, an'
drops 'em into a bucket of water to make
her steam a whole lot. Then they shoves
this yere lmpromptoo coldron inside the
little robe house, where, as I'm awareâ
for I onderstands the signs from the start
âthar's a sick buck (rolled up awaltin* re
lief. This yere invalid buck stays in thar
mighty likely twenty minutes. The water
boils an' bubbles, an* the steam gets that
abundant, not to say urgent. Inside, sho
shore half lifts the robes an' blankets at
the alges to escape. The ailin* buck In tha
sweat tent stays ontil he can't stay no
more, an' then, with a yowl, he comes
burstin' forth, a reek of sweat, an' goei
wallowin* into the coolin* waters of Bird
River. It's the Sixkiller; that weddin*
feast comes mighty near downin' himâ
gives him a 'bad heart,' an' he ondergoes
this steam bath medicinal.
"An* now, like a landslide, upon tho
Crooked Clav.s comes â¢ the Strike Axe
tiousehold. Which they're thar to the
forty-'leventh cousin; savages keepin' ex
act cases on reiatif3 a mighty sight fur
ther than white folks. The Crooked Claw
t'am'ly is ready, it's the Crooked Claw
turn to make the feast, an' that eminent
Osage goes the distance. Crooked Claw
shorely does himse'f proud, while Bill's
mother, the Silent Comanche, is hospit
able but dignified. The Wild Cat is pi
rootin* about, makin' mean an* onfeelin*
remarks, as becomes a widow lady with
a knowledge of the world an* a bundle
of money of the size an* contoor of a roll
of blankets. Tha two f am' lies goes
squanderin' absut among each other,
free an* fraternal, an' thar's never a
cloud in the sky.
"Aa Saucy Willow embarks on this yere
trip, thar starts to meet herâ afoot they
be, but on the runâ Tom Six-killer an' a
brace of squaw cousins of Biil's. Nach
erally, bein' he out-iopea the cousins. Turn
Six-killer runs up on the Saucy Willow
first an' grabs her bronco by tne bridle.
The two young squaw cous.ns ain't far
behind the Sii.-khnjrâ for them savages
can shore run like rabbits â an' they ar
rives, all laughter an' cries, an' witn one
move searches the Saucy Willow outen
the saddle. In less time than it takes to
get action on a drink of licker them
young females had done stripped tho
Saucy Willow of every feather, bead an'
rag. an' then naked as when she's foaled
they wrops her up, precious an' safe, in
a blanket an' packs her gleefully into the
camp of Crooked Claw. Thar they re
dresses the Saucy Willow an' piles on tho
gew-gaws an' adornments ontil if any
thin she's a heap more gorgeous than
former. That pony which the Saucy Wil
low rides goes to the Six-killer, while
them two she-cousins, a3 to the balance
of her apparel that a-way, divides tho
pot. '
".Mebby she's a week later when
dawns me weddin' day. JtJill, who's been
looiun' a heap ediotic an' numb ever
since these yere rites begins, goes pro
jectin' off alone out onto the prairie.
The Saucy Willow is hid in tne deepest
recesses of Strike Axe's tepee, which if
she's visible, however, you'd be shore
amazed at the foolish expression she
wears, but all as sny an" artless that
a-v.ay as a yearim' antelope.
"Final, one of the Strike Axe's bucks
swings into the saddle an' rides out half
way towards tiie camp of Crooked Claw.
Which Strike Axe an' Crooked Claw has
done pitched tneir camps about half a
mile apart, so as to give tnls yere pa
geant proper eclat. "W nen he's half way
the Strike Axe tuck fronts up an' slams
loose with his Winchester; it's a. signal
the baile- is on.
â¢ "At the rifie crack, mounted on a
pony that's the flower of the Strike Axa
herd, the Saucy Willow, all alone, comes
chargin' for tiie Crooked Claws like a
shootin' star. Which this y.e Saucy Wil
low is a mir*cle of Osage richness: She's
Blmply a bundle of rive huncred dollars'
worth of blankets, feathers, beads, cali
cos, ribbons, an' buckskins, with six
pounds of brass an' silver jewelry thrown
in. Straight an' troo comes the Saucy
Willow; nashin' like a arrer, rapid as the
Â¦wind!
"But the Crooked Claw outfit ain't dis
mayed none, an* takej inia yere rebuff
phlegmatic. It's oniy so much ettyquette;
an' now they reorganize to leau ag'in.
This time they goes the limit, an' brings
up fifteen pomes, an' stacks in with blan
kets, robes, beei. Hour, calico, kettles,
skillets an' looking glasses enough to fill
eight wagons- Tnis trip the oid Strike
Axe squaw onties the fifteen ponies, an'
takin' 'em by their ropes Drings 'em in
clost to the Strike Axe camp, tharby noti
fyin' the Crooked Claw band that their
bluff Jtor the Saucy Willow is regyarded,
as some feasible, an* them nuptials goes.
With this sign, the Crooked . Claw band
comes caperm' up to the Strike Axe fam
ily, an' the latter proceeds to rustie a pro
foosion of grub; an' they all cuts loose
in an' simpiy eats old Strike Axe outen
house an' nome. The "price" is split up
among the Strixe Axe bunch, shares goin.'
even to second an' third cousins.

a Kcros s meeting last month all were in

be in light weight dark whipcord. The

v.-ith the inverted box plait at the back.
Around the foot I would have the circulai

stitching. The uj)Der part of the suit

fastening under a Run metal buckle.

be nnislied with very small lapels turned

appearance would be precisely similar to
that f,f a man's busness coat. The sleeve*
would be the coat sleeve, with a verv
slight bell at the hand.
"In the matter of linings I would follow
the newest mode, which calls for a Jacket
lined with white and a skirt unllned but
supplied with an all-taffeta drop skirt,
much resembling a petticoat.
"With both of these suits I would have
an English box coat; one that could be
worn with either suit would do. It could
be made of ladfes' cloth of very heavy
weight, or of broadcloth. It should be

Black for Evening.
It was a very wise dress authority who
advised a woman, wishing to make a dis
tinct Impression in the. evening, to dress
all In white. "In a gown of white," said
ne, you are visible from everywhere. At
the same time it is not conspicuous. It
is the one attractive color that does not
look startling in any light."
The same, only more, might be said of
black.
The handsomest, gown at a fashionable
ball a few evenings ago was in grena
dine, dotted. The entire surface of the
goods had the tiniest black velvet spots,
ihey were not shaggy, but smooth, really
a fine soft velvet, not the heavy, shaggy
sort usually used for this purpose.
Down the front of the waist there was
an embroidery- ln silvered leaves and the
same trimming went down the front of
the skirt. Long sprays of thp leaves
reaching from the belt. downward, decor
ated the front panel and stretched off
toward *.he back. Here and there were
embroidered ilov.ers in black silk ami, in
Â«he petals of the flowers, were drops of
pearl, Just small pearl beads carefully
applied.
The <-kirt of this gown, which was con-
Kderably more than sweep length, had a
very tnteU double ruching around th<?

5 There Is an. adage that if a woman
wants a man to love her she should
wear white. This also applies to black.
' She who wears black hypnotizes."
"Black Is the charm color," said a
Beau Brummel a few days ago, a man
who has studied dress from the middle Â¦
. of the last century.
The Tale of a Gown.
And there ' Is a story told of a < young
woman of . much beauty and ; many at
tractions who wished to win the man of
her heart. In vain she looked her pret
tiest, and in -vain aha ? chose \ moro ana
there is a. woman in Xew Tork. one of
its fashionable dressers, who solemnly
asuerts that black has been the means of
utterly undoing her purse. With so many
fabrics, in so many handsome weighty
grades and brocades, appliqued and deco
rated as they are, she has been led Into an
extravagance which never afflicted her
when she chose her gowns from the
colored counters. Tempted beyond her
means is she by the allurements of black.
For a black suit to i>e purchased now
and worn steadily, there are choices in
these goods, among others: cheviot, serge.
twe*d, vicuna, covert suiting, ladies'
cloth, zibeline and serge. Then there are
the corduroys which are so much the
vogue. A gown in any of these is g6od
and can be made up along the improved
lines that have come in. >
"If I were a woman, dressing on a mod
erate amount," said a modiste the other
day, "and if I desired to get a suit now
between seasons, as it is. I should invest
in a fine serge ln a dull or dead black.
"I should." continued she. "make it up
as An Eton, In the etvle known as the
double breasted blouse Eton. And I should
trim it with narrow braid.

would be the blouse front, coming down
over a low pointed belt of cloth. The back
of the waist would be perfectly plain and
there would be a tall, rolling collar. The
blouse could be opened at the neck and
worn with deep, rolling revere fronts.
"The skirt I would make with nve

foot. At the back I would terminate the

Accordion Plaits.
The black shirt. waists are accordion

each dot should'have its buttonhole stitch

have a black buttonhole stitching. :
Accordion plaits, threaten to be the pop
ular trimming of the spring. They are so
becoming that they plead their own way
to. favor. An accordion plaited skirt, with
the plaits stitched upon the hips and front
and backâ tightly stitched to , the knee
line, then suddenly releasedâ is one of the
handsome novelties of early spring. It re
quires . careful . dressmaking to make It
hang < well. But once , done it Is a great
success. Under the bottom, to- make tho
ripple - fuller, there 'Â¦ la ' set . a -; plaiting - ot

that was plain, but how deepen his 1 ad
miration into love?
A young woman of proper spirit would
have said, "If he does not love me as- 1
am, it is best that he do not love me at
all."
But not so reasoned this young woman.
She kept on and kept on, determined to
captivate. On one day an old French
maid, one who had seen service, in many
. a . wealthy family, said to her: "Why
does not Madamolselle try black for
once, black gauze? Madamolselle would
be so truly fascinating."
The next evening the young woman ap
peared In a gown of black gauze. The
skirt fell all foamy and billowy around
her and swept behind so 'attractively.
.But the waist was the crowning thing.
This was in gauze, cut surprisingly low
To bring it up properly there was a gauze
ruffle at the neck and a little gauze
gimp shirred upon a tiny ribbon that
could be tied and untied. Her arms were
bare, except for black laco elbow
sleeves, made plainly. . In her hair a
black aigrette gleamed saucily and when
she put on her hat she put on her hat,
for the gown \vasÂ»donned' for a reception
occasion, it was a > soft thing, ln black
maline, set far. back upon her head and
draped In white, with a black Jet buckle
at one side looping up the brim. ;
The gown, it is related,, was a success,
and tho. young man's captivation was
complete. / . â¢ .-.
In the black evening fabrics there are
several that are to be recommended for
their durability. Crepe do chine, that ma
terial that looks so delicate, yet in reality
is very tough and which 'will bear a
great, deal of rough treatment without
showing wear and tear, is in favor. Crepe
*de chine is an old material which has
come intn favor again, and it is going to
be more popular now than it ever was
before. Never entirely out of style it is
directly in again, and comes In ail colors

The magpie effects are decidedly pood.
These are in black and white. Blade
waists of satin, taffeta, brocade, moira or
what not in the way of dressy fabrics,
are trimmed with white lace. This is put
on in fancy ways. One very decorative
mode of trimming: a black waist with
white lace is by the application of lace
In a pattern. Lay it on in great scallops
and let it outline the yoke. The -wider
and finer the lace the better..
A Lace Finish.
Decorative lace, with two or tare*
kinds of lace combined in one pattern. In
the fashionable novelty laces, is excellent.

lace applications that are specially fitted
for this. Beginning at the back in a fig
ure they come over the shoulder and
make a scroll in front. Very striking this
is In coarse lace upon a moire background

A trimming of white that was used
with very good results upon a waist of

but-further up upon the shoulder than
epaulettes go. -and very flat, not stand

hand and gathered upon a very narrow
white satin ribbon, is a thing to conjur*
with. Worn around the neck and allowed

trimmed with small roses, are seen at tho
most elegant social functions and the
beauty of them Is that they look equally
well upon the high necked gown or the

The little lace sets that can be pur

crime, but Qoucher and the woman got
away. While in the prison Randolph sent
notes to the woman cautioning her to re
main away from the Jail for fear the po
lice might trail her and discover the lair
of the gang. Randolph wa3 released on
$75 cash ball and his case waa assigned
to Judge Cabaniss' court. It was post
poned from time to time and is still pend
ing. Randolph has disappeared. :
Detectives Hamill and Reynolds have
been scouring the tenderloin In a vain
search for Minnie Randolph, but. as yet
they have failed to locate her. When they
finally take her into custody it is expect
ed that she will unbosom herself of the
gang's secrets and probably give the po
lice .valuable information as to the route
taken by Goucher and "Brownie" when
they left the city,' and their proposed des
tination. Â¦ - "â¢Â¦Â¦ ' ' ,
As exclusively announced in yesterday's
issue of The Call, Captain Seymour's men
developed a live clew Friday to tho
whereabouts of "Kid" Goucher and his
pal, "Brownie," and yesterday's investi
gations bore out the belief that the mur
derers left town last Wednesday on the
Sunset Limited, secreted under the trap
door over the stairs located at each- end
of a Pullman car. Two tramps were
taken from the regular local southbound
train at San Jose Wednesday night- Tina
Â¦ train arrived hours after. the limited went
through San Jose. The men did not
answer the descriptions of Goucher and
"Brownie," and they were not the same
men whom the switchman and yard
master at the Southern Pacific depot saw
leaving town on the limited, which left
this city at 4:50 o'clock in the afternoon.
Suspicious-looking characters answering
the description of Goucher and "Brownie
were seen Thursday in the vicinity of San
Jose, where the limited train made }ts
first stop. Since the country town con
stables * have been deprived of the fee
they formerly received for the arrest and
conviction of "hobos" caught stealing a
ride on the brakebeams or blind baggage
they have paid little, or no attention to
men found passing through towns in this
manner. As Captain Seymour did not
receive the tip until Friday that the two
railroad men at the local depot had seen
the criminals making their escape from
town on Wednesday's limited the murder
ers had a good start Captain Seymour,
however, Is not depending entirely on
the clew furnished him by ths BWttchman
and yardmaster at the Third-street depot.
He has wired the' authorities of all the
northern towns, as well to be on the look
out for the two murderers.
Information has been received to tho
effect that "Kid" Goucher and "Brownie"
did not attempt to abandon their Turk
street hiding place until early Wednesday
morning Instead of Tuesday morning as
was first reported. One of the ' lodgers
upstairs saw Goucher leaving, the house
Wednesday morning. He was accompa
nied by a burly mulatto, who often vis
ited and slept at the Turk-street house.
The pair walked hurriedly across Turk
street and then went up Jones.
They looked back several times to see If
anybody was watching them.
It is not . Impossible that the mulatto
who left the house with Ooucher was
"Brownie," as his nickname would Indi
cate. Those who claim to Know the man
are divided as to whether or not he is of
mixed blood. None of the detectives know
VBrownle" personally. They have only a
poor description of- him and they are un
able to state whether or not he la a mu
latto or, a dark-complexioned white
man. The police have succeeded In learn
ing his "road name." and tney hope, with
this Information, to trace him more easily
In the country towns.
The three suspects held at Sulsun proved
to have no connection with the pans: of
crooks who murdered Robinson. One of
them was identified, however, as "Black
Pat" Danls, wanted for burglary In Sac
ramento.

tnem to the Elysium, 666 Geary street,
and, as instructed, remained outside for
about half an hour. The young man and
the young woman came downstairs, and
at their request he drove them to a sa
loon at Fifth and Market streets. The
young man treated him to a drink at the
bar and then entered a box with the
young woman. They came out in a few
minutes and the young man treated him
to. another drink. Witness then drove
them to the saloon at 30 Fourth street,
where he left them. Miller said he could
not identify either of the defendants,
which was a surprise to the prosecution,.
James M. Fortune, night clerk # at the
Elysium, testified to taking two women
up In the elevator. One was Mrs. Foote
and the other "the lady defendant." as
he expressed It. The defendant Galvln,
whom he identified, rang the elevator bell
and wanted to be taken UDstalrs. but wit
ness refused. Shortly afterward he was
at the third floor and saw both defend
ants going Into Mrs. Foote's apartments.
In a few minutes he heard screams and
the patter - of feet running downstairs.
He saw Mrs. Foote In her night robe with
blood on her face, and she screamed that
she had been robbed and the defendants
had tried to murder her.

Walter C. Brown, the son of City Jailer
Brown of this city,- had been spending a
few days on the Brown ranch, on the San

He left there Wednesday morning early
to come home. On the San Antonio road,
about three miles back of Mount Hamil
ton, shortly after 10 o'clock Thursday, he
met two men and a boy with a horse and
cart. These two men answer the descrip
tion of "Brownie" and Goucher.
The boy, who was about 17 years of age,
was In a cart driving a wornout old horse.
Trudging along beside the rig were the
two men. The road is very narrow and
some difficulty was experienced in pass
ing. Brown hailed the men and inquired
where they were going. His questions
were evaded, but as they were delayed a
few moments in getting the rigs paat each
other Brown had a good chance to "size
up" the men.'; :>*-''-'
After, repeated 'questioning the men said
they were going -to Fresno. - Brown asked
why they had not taken the Pacheco road,
where they could have come 'out at Los
Banos and had good' roads most of the
way to Fresno. He told them the road
they were on was a rough one and that
they would reach Newman by that route.
Brown noticed that the men were Jaded
and had the appearance of having trav
eled all night. â¢ They seemed very anxious
to pass on. They had every appearance
of being guilty of some crime. On his
way down to this city Brown could not
find any place where the men had camped,
and this further, aroused his curiosity.

Danger of a Strike on AH the
Railways May Be
' ] Averted.
ROME, Jan. 25. â The Official Journal to
night announces that the covernment has
taken a decided stand in view of the ru r
mors of an impending strike upon all the
great railways in Italy. The Cabinet an
nounces that it cannot consider a] railway
strike, affecting, as it does, great public
interests. In the same category with a
strike of ordinary workers, but will class
such action as a strike of public servants
as punishable under the penal code.
While determined not to allow a railway
strike the Cabinet recognizes the right of
the working classes to improve their own
condition, and therefore the Government
has approached the railroad companies
with a view of obtaining the desired con
cessions, which it is confident it can d.o. .
ITALIAN GOVERNMENT
TO AID LABOR'S CAUSE
"With extreme cleverness the Ameri
cans, under cover of establishing a great
national principle, made the French own
ers of the Panama route eager to sell
their property. The Americans were at
once persuaded that the Panama
route was the better in nearly every par
ticular. The thrifty Frenchman, out of
whose pocket . the money was originally
wheedled, must grin and bear this final
shame as he may. Completed by Ameri
can capital and energy, the canal will be
a boon to international commerce \ and
will probably give an impetus to the con
struction of the American merchant ma
rine with a navy to match it."
"The Americans can do one thing to
perfectionâ they can drive a hard bargain.
The sufferer on this occasion is France,
which was completely hoodwinked by the
American bluff. The Panama directors
have agreed to sell their rights for $40,
000,000 and the United States will jump at
the proposal. The Americans' have made
a very good bargain; better, perhaps,
than is seemly in international dealings."
The Outlook somewhat in the same vein
says:
LONDON, Jan. 23.â The report of the
Isthmian Canal Commission at Washing
ton favoring the acceptance of the offer
of the Panama Canal Company to sell its
property and rights to the United States
for $40,000,000 causes some comment here.

A HARD BARGAIN
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25.â Edward V. Mor
gran, second secretary of legation at St.
PetersburK, has been selected to fill the va
cancy In the State Department caused by the
death of Thomas Keller. Mr. Morgan la a
native of New York and has had considerable
diplomatic experience.
"He has ever been ready to enlighten
the public opinion of his country ana to
show that Germany entertained no omin
ous plans against the United States. Mr.
White's political work has not been in
vain. Prince Henry's visit is an Impres
sive manifestation of the German em
pire's desire to cherish its friendship for
the American republic."
Dr. Barth, in the Nation, dwelling on
the political significance of the trip
recognizes the great service of the United
States Embassador here, Andrew White,
in preventing misunderstanding between
the two countries. Barth says:
His Majesty has taken the leading New
York newspapers since Prince Henry's
trip was planned and has clipped articles
which he thought would Interest the
Prince's suite and has sent them to the
Prince. The principal German news
papers will send special correspondents
to New York en the Kron Prinz Wilhelm
Among them will be Captain Dannen
hauer of the Lokal Anzeiger, Alexander
von Huhn of the Vossische Zeitung and
Konard Alberts, editor of the Berlin
Horning Post.
Prince Henry's attitude toward the press
when in the United States has been the
subject of consideration by his counselors
While the Prince will not be interviewed,
he desires to show respect for the pro
fession and will give an audience to the
newspaper men with the understanding
that he is not to be quoted. What the
Prince has to say will be issued through
the official channels.
"That Prince Henry, as the representa
tive of the German Emperor, comes in
Immediate contact with the press is a
particularly happy thought. The modern
spirit inspiring the whole expedition is
brought sharply into view through the
Emperor's brother becoming the guest of
Journalists."
The dinner to be given in Prince Hen
ry's honor, under the auspices of the
New York Staats Zeitung, to the press of
the United States, is the feature of the
Prince's diversion which is attracting the
most attention here. Prince Henry him
self asked particularly about this feature
of the programme and when told that
some of the editors would probably travel
3000 miles to be present, he expressed
wonder. Dr. Barth says, in the Nation
to-day:
Prince Henry, who is now here, will re
turn to Kiel February 10, and remain
there till be goes to Bremen to embark
for the United States. The various mem
bers of the Prince's party will assemble
at Bremen, February 14. The sailing of
Prince Henry will not be marked by any
special ceremony, nor, so far as known,
will any member of the royal household
see the Prince off.
BERLIN, Jan. 25.â When Emperor Wil
liam bids Prince Henry of. Prussia fare
well, prior to the latter's departure for
the United States, their parting will be
a simple private affair. No speeches for
publication will be exchanged. The leave
taking will assume the form of a mili
tary act, in which an officer receives the
last Instructions from his sovereign be
fore going on an important mission. It
is undestood that his Majesty will give
Prince Henry written memoranda of
what he wishes his royal brother to com
municate to President Roosevelt.

George P. Morrow, vice president of the
association, delivered an able speech in
favor of the reopening of the track. He
said he could not see why it should not be '
reopened. He called attention to the mag
nificent property in the outskirts of the
city that was going, to waste. He argued
that as there was racing on every side of
the city there ought to be racing here, so
that the merchants would reap the bene
fit. He heartily seconded tne motion and
expressed the hope that the committee
sent by the association would use Its ut
most endeavors to . bring about . the re

Joseph Magner, a fellow director, fol
lowed and made a motion that the chair
man appoint a committee of three to at

Supervisors and appeal to the members
to vote for the reopening of the race
track. He dwelt on the benefits to be de
rived from racing In this city. He be
lieved that if there was to be racing at
Oakland and Tanforan, there should be
racing In San Francisco. He said the
residents wanted it and were bound to
have It, as was evidenced by the thou
sands who crossed the ferry daily to at
tend the races. W. A. Miller in second
ing the motion also spoke heartily in fa
vor of racing in San Francslco.

The speaker was interrupted with cries
of "We do! We do!" and loud hurrahs for
the racetrack.
Gentlemen, you have seen by the press that
an ordinance has been introduced before the
Board of Supervisors for the reopening of the
Ingleslde racetrack. I believe that the re
opening of that track will be a benefit to
every merchant in San Francisco, whether or
not he eella hay or grain. - /
The money that is being spent across the
bay and in other counties will be spent here.
We are not In business for our health and
it behooves us to take some, action in this
important matter. I desire to have an ex

association as to whether or not we want
the lngleside track reopened.
Frank A. Somers, director of the organ

members. He -said that all were there to
have a good time, but business of im
portance to the association and the wel
fare of its members could not be Ignored.
The banqueters were impressed with Mr.'
Somers' statement and silence pervaded
the banquet hall. Continuing, he said:

ter was taken during the height of the

and not a dissenting vote was voiced
against it. The motto of the association

' the entire mucous membrane, or inner covering of the body, is in a state of high inflamma^

much of which is absorbed into the blood and distributed to all- parts of the body. In this
way the stomach, kidneys aud intestines are often seriously affected.

Good Doctors Are Quick to See
and Appreciate Real Merit
in New Medicines.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are a discovery
of great value to the medical profession and
the public. They are an unfailing specific* in
all cases of, dyspepsia and disordered diges-
tion.
Almost everybody's digestion is disordered
more or less, and the commonest thins they
do for it is to take some one of the many so-
called blood purifiers, which in many casts are
merely strong cathartics. Such things are not
needed. If the organs ar/j in a clogged condi-
tion, they need only a little help and they
will right themselves. Cathartics irritate the
sensitive linings of the stomach and bowels
and often do more harm than good.
Purging is not what .is needed. * The thing
to do is to put the food in condition to be
readily digested and assimilated. Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets do this' perfectly. They
partly digest what" is eaten and give the
stomach Just the help it needs. They stimu-
late the secretion and .excretion of the diges-
tive fluids and relieve the congested condition
of the glands and membranes. They put the
whole digestive system in condition to do its
work. When that is done you need take no
more tablets, unless you eat what does not
agree, with you. Then take one or two tab-
letsâgive them needed help and you will hav*
no trouble.
It's a common-sense medicine and a com-
mon-sense treatment , and It will cure fverv
time. Not only cure the disease but "cur* ?>,Â»

Is wrong and unfriendly and that the

SYDNEY. N. S. W., .. Jan. , 25.-The
placing of contracts in Argentina by the
British War Office to supply meats and
other produce for the troops in South
Africa has engendered extreme irritation
throughout Australasia. This action of
the Imperial authorities is regarded as
evidence of a reprehensible indifference to
the claims of the colonies, as ill accord
ing with the expression of imperial soli
darity, as poor repayment for the sacri
fices of the colonists and generally as a
grave injustice.
Most of the Premiers of Australasia and
the Premier of New Zealand have cabled
to the Imperial Government strong pro
tests in practically identical terms, say
ing that the two colonies are able to sup
ply the War Office requirements In South
Africa three times over.
The fact that these documents were of no
importance did not alter the violation of
strict neutrality. The case, the Minister
said, was bound to have an important
bearing on the question as to what service
a neutral ambulance corps might render
In future wars.

Charles 8. Mellen, president of the
Northern Pacific, was then called. Mellen
said his conferences jwith'J. J. Hill were
not more frequent or potent than those
with any other presidents of Northwest

ments between the Northern Pacific and
either the Great Northern, Union Pacific
or Canadian Pacific roads on allotment
of traffic or on differentials. The North

George B. Harris, president of the old
and new Burlington companies, then tes
tified as to the transfer of the Chicago,
Burlington and Qulncy Railroad Com
pany's effects to the Chicago, Burlington
and Qulncy Railway Company, promised
to furnish the commission a copy of the
ninety-nine year lease of the road and
said that none of his conferences with
Hill or others had any " reference other
than to the general efficiency of the road.
He said it was the hope of the new com
pany to be able to reduce rates, and said
such reduction would follow only natural
conditions. He favored publicity for all
rates transactions. â¢
Bailroad Presidents Heard.
He stated that this, however, need not
have been done in such a company. The
suggestion was made by the commission
that this company might also prevent re
duction of published rates by competing
roads. He did not consider the company
afforded a power of concentration for
pooling. Other large considerations than
stockholding 1 , he held, Influence rates.
"If Hill or- myself owned all the roads
the people would get better rates because
of conditions. With a freer hand we
could the better regulate rates to any
POint."-- Â».-â¢* - ,-,-'- , - .:Â¦ â¢
He added that he did not think compe
tition ever reduced rates more than tem
porarily. â¢ . â¢- Â¦ â¢ Â¦ â¢ -
At the conclusion of his testimony Har
riman took a special train for New York.
Hill, who: was not called again to the
stand, was excused and accompanied
Harriman.
"It may enable us," said Harriman,
"when brought so close together, to elim
inate the prevailing Â¦ distrust as to the
various lines maintaining, traffic rates.
The complaint has been of too high rates.
We may be able to stop the discrimina
tion in rates of one shipper against an
other."
Harriman insisted that the common In
terest of all systems now affiliated under
the Northern Securities Company must
be considered rather than the so-called
community of interest. He said he was a
member of the board of directors of the
Securities Company and Hill was Its pres
ident, but the combination under that
company affected rates in no wise. He
told how, shortly after the scramble over
Northern Pacific stock, Mugan had bÂ«en
given a proxy by him in oialer to sell the
stock again. It was understood the sale
was to be effected in cash and securitiesâ
the latter in the Northern Securities Com
pany if it should be organized. Harriman
eventually controlled about $60,000,000 of
the stock of this company. The question
if the formation of the Northern Securi
ties Company and the association of so
many roads might Influence rates brought
a denial. - â¢ '

had been given no assurances of any di
vision of traffic and that the motive of the
original purchase had been that of pre
serving to the Union Pacific system the
avenues of traffic open to it.
"You wish to represent that no one of
the other half .of the Northern Pacific in
terests made any promise in control?
Harriman replied: "There is a common
interest among us all, and we believe that
common interest will be served regardless
of holdings. That common interest can be
served by natural conditions. Our inter
ests are so in common that we cannot in
jure others without injuring ourselves. '
â¢ Commissioner Prouty asked: "If you
had secured a few more million of North
ern Pacific it would have made a differ
ence, would it not?"
"We could have had it, was the reply.
The questions as to Just why Harriman
had disposed of his Northern Pacific hold
ings, what was lost or made by the trans
action, and whether Hill- had made some
agreement in case the holdings were sold,
brought from Harriman the response that
natural conditions controlled. He said
that he did not know of any gain made
except that his interests found out that
they were strong enough to hold their
own in Pacific traffic. He said his impres
sion was that the Oregon Short Line had
not lost by the transaction. He said Hill
Harriman said that after the purchase
was made he and his colleagues thought
the matter over and they thought better
to sell again. He implied that it made no
difference really who owned Northern Pa
cific.
An attempt, was made by the commis
sion to draw out statements to the effect
that the flnaK. sale of Northern Pacific
stock by the Oregon Short Line, as con
trolled by the Union Pacific-Southern Pa
cific syndicate, was only after an under
standing or truce with Hill and the sup
posed interests that combated for North
ern Pacific In the panic.
Natural Conditions Control.
Questions were then put that Indicated
"jobbing" had been resorted to In the
purchase, and which brought the reply:
"The stock was purchased in New York
from persons who bought from owners.
Then when the so-called . contest came
sellers found ' It difficult to fulfill their
contracts. Our Interest in every case gave
the persons all the time they wanted.' ;
"Some of the stock," he continued, "we
had bought in markets all over the world.
Some of this was on the way from these
various markets to be delivered. In the
meantime the sellers borrowed." . ,
"I don't think there was any contest,"
said Harriman. "Some of us â the Oregon
Short Line peopleâ thought It would be
advantageous to have an Interest in
Northern Pacific and purchased stock
that was lying loose all over this country
and Europe^ â held by five to seven thou
sand persons. We made no contest for
the control of Northern Pacificâ we pur
chased a majority of the capital stock.
We purchased prior to the supposed con
test and no stock was acquired during the
panic in May."
Day tried to show that the contest for
Northern Pacific stock was the forerunner
of the panic on 'Change, but Harriman
insisted that such was not the case.
An effort, was made: to learn, why the
purchase had been made only to sell
again, and this- brought from Harriman
the statement that he was glad to ex
plain the so-called "contest" 'in the New
York Stock Exchange, which resulted in
the famous "Black Thursday."
Explains So-Called Contest
When Harriman went on the stand the
line of questioning by W. A. Day, coun
sel for the commission, led up to a state
ment of the great Wall street panic last
May, when Northern Pacific shares went
up to $1000. Hnrriman had testified that
the Oregon Short Line, aided by the Un
ion Pacific, had. purchased some $78,00O.0C0
of Northern Pacific stock and that the
Union Pacific, through the voice of ita
directors, controlled the Southern Pacific.
It was developed that all this Northern
Pacific stock, which was held in the name
of E. H. Harriman and Wlnslow Pierce,
was sold last summer.
E. H. Harriman, who organized the
Southern Pacific- Union V Pacific combina
tion, and who was Hill's opponent in the
struggle for the Northern Paciflc-Bur
lington control, was the flrst witness.
CHICAGO, Jan. 25.â When the second
day's inquiry by the. Interstate Commerce
Commission into the "community, of in
terest" combination of the great railways
of the Northwest opened to-day . the
United States Court room, where the in
vestigation .was held, was crowded with
well-known railroad men from all over
the country, eager to learn more of the.
details of the inner workings of the gi
gantic Northern Securities Company from
the master mind that conceived it.
Toastmaster Munger spoke entertain
ingly and his words were repeatedly in
terrupted by cheers. The first response
was by -Beverly Price, formerly president
of the Maryland Society of Chicago. His
subject was "The State of Maryland." He
referred to the admiral as the "foremost
Marylandejr of his time." The speaker
quoted a brief portion of Isador Rayner's
speech before the court of Inquiry In be
half of. Admiral Schley and was cheered.
The guests then sang "Maryland. - My
Maryland," adding two stanzas which had
been written for the occasion*
CHICAGO, Jan. 25.â The banquet to Ad
mlrar Schley began at 6:45 o'clock. The
admiral, arm in arm with K. A. Munger,
the toastmaster, and Mayor Harrison, was
the flrst to enter the banquet hall. Gov
ernor Yates' sat near him at the speaker's
table. Â¦ In front of the guest of the even
ing was an immense bouquet of. roses. At
each plate as a souvenir was a replica In
plaster of the likeness of Admiral Schley.
The same replica, done in bronze, lay be
fore the admiral. Facher Vattman, chap
lain at Fort Sheridan, made an Invocation,
following which the banquet was served.
Prominent Citizens of Chicago.
Interesting Addresses Are Made by
SCBCLEY AT A BANQUET.
"I have been deeply toucned by the trib
utes which I have received," he said.
"They have been tributes of love, and in
my future years I shall never accept any
office however hi^h, which might Jeop
ardize that love. It is the dearest thing
I have. It is the greatest crown a man
can have on this earth, and when I am
gone I want it left with my children and
their children as their dearest possession."
On his way back to the hotel the ad
miral' stortned for a few minutes at the
Chicago Athletic Club and the Woman's
Club.
At the Booster Club, of which he Is an
honorary member, the admiral, still in a
Jovial mood, addressed a few. happy re
marks to "My fellow members." In the
course of his speech he again indicated
his feeling in regard to the political pre
ferment which has been talked about for
him. " . â¢
"I want to say that these boys were al
ways to the forefrontâ one of them so
much so that I was afraid that he'd be
sunk. "At the time I wished he was any
where else. But the boys were brave. It
isn't pleasant to be shot at. but these boys
stood up and were not only shot at, but
couldn't shoot back."
At the Press Club the reception was re
peated, except that of the two or three
hundred persons present fully 50 per cent
were women. A number of men who were
correspondents in Cuba during the fights
about Santiago "tvere present and to them
the admiral referred' in his short speech
of thanks as follows:
Resolved, That we consider It bnt simple
justice to these gallant officers and men that
their distinguished service should be properly
rewarded without further delay, and we do
hereby respectfully request the authorities of
the United States Government to adopt with
all due haste such measures for this purpose
as may be most becoming and which will best
be calculated to express the desires of the
great body of people who believe that there
should be speedy and complete recognition of
the services of all who contributed to the glori
ous victories of the nation.
Whereas, The services rendered by Admiral
Schley during the Spanish war were the means
of presenting such unprecednted skill and ef
ncie*-?y as to command thÂ» admiration of thÂ«
civilized world and greatly enhance the dig
nity and Importance of our country in its in
ternational relations, and
Whereas, There has as yet been no adequate
reward or official recognition of the merits of
some of the officers whose heroism and fidelity
were most conspicuous, of whom may be es
pecially enumerated Admiral Winfleld Scott
Schley. Captain F. A. Cook of Admiral Schleye
flagship Brooklyn and Captain Charles E.
Clark of the famous battleship Oregon, to
gether . with other of the gallant officers i and
men who won battle on land and eea, not yet
rewarded: therefore be it
At the conclusion of. the breakfast a del
egation from the Board of Commissioners
of Cook County and Commissioner Hoffer
presented the following resolutions:
Besolutions of Praise.
A double line of policemen stood at the
depot when the admiral alighted, but
they were unable to restrain the crowds,
which straightaway went wild at the
sight of the easily" recognized goatee
which showed above the heads of the
guards asj^an unrnJataKable mark fc of the
wearer'B'ideritlty. ' : A delegation- of school
children;- waving flags, greeted the visitor
at the farther end .of the station.;- The
Municipal Council's, resolutions were pre
sented, and the admiral and Mrs. Schley
were ' driven : through â¢ demonstrative
throngs to their apartmentsâ the "Presi
dential suite", at the Auditorium. Here
Admiral Schley retired' to don his "shore)
togs," as he expressed it. At 11 a. m. he
was " given a breakfast by ' the reception
committee of the Hamilton Club. The
first table was laid for twenty-one per
sons. Among these present were Gov
ernor Tates, Mayor Harrison and former
Comptroller of the Treasury Eckels.
As the train drew into the outskirts of.
the city factory whistles blew their wild
est notes and hundreds of people rushed
down every street leading to the tracks
and waved their hands. "Wherever pos
sible the admiral answered- back through
the windows of his car, bowing his head
and fluttering a handkerchief. Mrs.
Schley eeemed to enjoy the demonstra
tion even more- than her distinguished
husband.
Admiral Schley, accompanied by Mrs.
Schley, was met in his private car at
South Chicago an hour before the train
arrived in the city proper. The delegation
represented the city and the Hamilton
Club, whose guest the admiral will be
during his etay here, which ends Tuesday
morning.
Whistles Shriek "Welcome.
"Whereas. The city of Chicago is honored by
a visk from Rear Admiral Wlnfleld Scott
Schley, and
Whereas. Our citizens are ever ready to ap
plaul valor, honor and merit, and
"Whereas, "We recognize in Admiral SchlÂ«y'Â»
achievements, ' his character and his bearing,
one of the foremost naval heroes of all times,
whose splendid record at Santiago will forever
be the pride and inspiration of his grateful
countrymen; therefore, be it '
Kesolved, By the City Council of the city
of Chicago, that the city of Â¦ Chicago through
its Mayor and Municipal Council, takes pleas
ure in making this public acknowledgement of
the distinguished services rendered by Admiral
Schley to his country and extends tp him a
heartfelt welcome.
CHICAGO, Jan. 25.-Rear Admiral W.
S. Schley to-day thrice declared that be
had no intention of entering politics. His
remarks were calculated to set at rest
for all time the political ambitions which
some of his admirers have entertained for
him. He said that no office, however
high, would tempt him to jeopardize thÂ«
love which the people of this country
have expressed for him.
The day for the admiral was a round
of receptions, at each of which he ex
pressed his gratitude for tokens of es
teem and approbation. The demonstra
tions reached their climax in the banquet
given in his honor by the Hamilton Club
in the banquet hall of the Auditorium.
Schley arrived at 9:30 a. m. and was
greeted with tumultuous acclaim from
thousands of people who crowded the
Baltimore and Ohio depot and 'thronged
nearby streets. He was officially greeted
by allegation from the City Council and
a company of naval veterans of the Civil
War. Alderman Frank Fowler, on be
half of the City Council, presented the
following resolutions:

watch and that . it . was 1:35 o'clock- He
then put on some additional clothing and,

An objection was sustained and a recess
declared. .... Â¦ ...... ':..'. â¢-â¢-.
Parks* testimony to-day," as Â¦ far aa It
went, was a complete contradiction of the
confessions of Hutton and Morris and of
their testimony on the stand. Judge Har
rington called the recess somewhat earlier
than usual, saying- that he waa tired.
The trial is evidently telling on all con-
and used it with that understanding..
Spencer again came to the aid of his
associate, saying, that Raker's use of ths
word was a slip of the tongue and that
he had not. used lt=wlth any Intention cf

Parks was asked- if ..he had 1 met John
Hutton or any one else at the race track
during the session of the Grand Jury, but
the questions were not allowed. Raker
claimed that the. matter had been brougnt
out In "cross-examination and the prosecu
tion said* it. had not. Judge Harrington
said that he would let the question go
over, until Monday morning,, when the re
porter could. have his notes ready to read.
Raker asked Parks many questions with
the view of showing that the witness had
not participated in any .way in the lynch
ing, and succeeded in getting answers to
the effect that Parks had never had any
intimation of the punishment that wag to
be meted to Calvin Hall, , James Hall,
Frank Hall, Daniel Yantls and Martin
Wilson. . - .;
The witness testified that when he went
into .Trowbridge's store the "time on the
afternoon of May 30. he met : . there E. S.
Trowbridge, C. J. Gooch,. R.. K. -Potter
and "Andrew Mclnnis, . a â¢ son-in-law of

Raker, with an injured air, said he had
done nothing wrong, and Boyd asked:

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ALTURAS, Jan. 25.â The burden of the
testimony of the witnesses examined In
the trial of James W. Brown, the alleged
lyncher, to-day was that Brown and the
ether defendants were men of unblem
ished reputations, while Robert Court
wright, one of the leading witnesses for
the prosecution, was a man not to be
believed under oath. : The last witness of
the day was Samuel Parks, one ot the
men accused of participation In the
lynching. While he was on the stand
counsel for the defense proceeded to kill
two birds with one stone Parks not only
contradicted the confessions of Hutton
and Morris, but he utilized the op
portunity in an attempt to show, with the
aid of leading Interrogatories, that he had
nothing to do with the tragedy of last
May.
George Howell, who testified that he
would not believe "Old Bob" Courtwright
under oath, narrowly escaped a thrashing
at the hands of Courtwright to-night.
The old man heard of Howell's testimony
and waited for him. Friends of Court
wright restrained him with difficulty and
Howell made his escape. Courtwright
claims to have sheltered and fed Howell
and his children when the latter were in
destitute circumstances.
feeling runs high between certain of
the witnesses in the case and it would
not be surprising if trouble of a serious
uature occurred.
Five witnesses were examined this
morning, and without exception gave
Oourtwrlght a very bad record. The wit
nesses were asked as to the general repu
tations of James W. Brown, the defend
ant, and other alleged lynchers and these
men were given spotless characters.
Stockman Gooch, Testifies.
The defense put three witnesses on the
stand this afternoonâ Thomas H. B. Mc-
Clure, C. J. Gooch and Samuel Parks.
McClure was called to show that Brown
and other defendants In the Lookout
lynching case bore good reputations up
to the time of the lynching. Like all the
witnesses called by the defense, McClure
gave the alleged lynchers good reputa
tions.
Gooch, a stockman, testified that he
was in Lookout on the atfernoon of May
30 last. He left a wagon at Leventon
Bros.* blacksmith shop to be repaired!
He arrived in Lookout at 2 o'clock in the
afternoon, and after leaving Leventon'a
shop went to Trowbridge's store and was
about the store more or less all afternoon.!
He said in answer to questions put to
him by Raker that Trowbridge St., R. R.
Potter, Andrew Mclnnis and Samuel
Parks were the only persons he saw in
the store that afternoon.
Raker then tried to bring out that the
members of the "town party" referred to
in the confessions of Hutton and Morris
were not there by asking questions In
suggestive phraseology. These questions
were objected to and the court ruled that
the witness could only say who were
there, if he knew. Raker was persistent
and the prosecution called the attention
of the court to the fact that Raker was
not obeying the court's instructions,
whereupon Judge Harrington reproved
Raker, saying:
"No Instructions the court could give
would Mr. Raker obey. He is the most
stubborn man I ever saw. You are a
strange compound, Mr. Raker."
Buys Drink for Calvin Hall.
After much questioning Gooch said that
he had known Brown for five years.
Asked if he saw Samuel Parks In Trow
bridge's store, the witness replied that he
had and that Parks was in the rope room,
cutting rope for halters. From Trow
bridge's store Gooch, with several others
went to Myers' Hotel to have a farewell
drink with Potter, who was going East.
On the way to the saloon the witness
asked Claude Morris to join the party,
but the Invitation was declined. Arriving
at the saloon, Calvin Hall was Invited to
join and accepted. Hall was a prisoner
in Myers' Hotel. The party, with the ex
ception of Hall, returned to Trowbridge's
store and the witness said he spent about
two-thirds of his time while he was in
Lookout that afternoon In the company
of Trowbridge Sr. He was asked if any
considerable number of persons entered
or left the store while he was there, and
replied in the negative.
Raker then asked if it were possible that
a meeting could have been held at the
store and he not know it, but the ques
tion was not allowed. Raker protested..
The court â You are wasting your precious
breath when you try to get me to change my
ruling. I rule advisedly and will not change
it. He can estate every one who was there,
but cannot state who was not there on your
suggestion.
Raker â State to the Jury whether you knew
that James Brown and other defendants (nam
ing them) were not there. â¢
An objection was sustained.
Raker â Did they hold a meeting there?
"Witness â No, they did not â not that I know
of â while I was there.
Both Hutton and Morris said In their
confessions and on the witness stand that
"the two parties met at .Trowbridge's
store to arrange for the place of meeting
for that night."
The witness was asked as to the general
reputation of the defendant and his al
leged accomplices In the lynching, and he
said It was good. . .
Gooch's Memory at Fault.
On cross-examination Post. brought out
the fact that there might have been oth
ers in the store when Gooch was there
whom he did not recall.
Samuel Parks, one of the defendants,
was next called to the stand and told of
his arrival In Lookout on the afternoon
preceding the lynching. . He came from
the Wilcox ranch, where he was em
ployed. Parks said that he went to Look
out for supplies. He first went to Leven
ton's blacksmith shop to have his horses
shod. Later he went to Trowbridge's
store and purchased some goods, including
rope for halters, and drove to the Myers'
Hotel. He said he knew Claude Morris
ellghtly, and that his acquaintance with
John Hutton commenced last November.
Raker brought up the subject of Parks'
testimony before the â Grand Jury last
June and attempted to have It introduced
a3 evidence In this case, but he was un
successful, the court sustaining the ob
jection of the prosecution.
Raker â Mr. Parks, I'll ask you on what
complaint you was confined In Jail?
Parks â On the complaint of Mary Lorenz.

OLJ THIS WEEK.
unnamed. It is a model of elocutionary
art; accent, emphasis, modulation, all
fitted to the noble verse to its last high
necessity. More than any other Shakes
pearean actor of the year, barring
Salassa, Mr. Haworth has the facility of
creating and sustaining illusion. The
"atmosphere" of the "Hamlet," as given
by him and his fellow-players at the
Grand Opera-house, held more conviction
than either the Kidder-Jaxnes or the
Modjeska-James performances, with all
their pomp of circumstance. I have seen
no more remarkable instance of the lift
and illumination of a single personality,
together with the known maglo of a
good play, than that afforded by Joseph.
Haworth's effect upon his associates at
the Grand Opera-house in the "Hamlet'*
and "Merchant of Venice" performances.
It is the product of an eminent I sincer
ity and a triumph of temperament.
Louis James never touches the bottom
of things in tragedy, though he is al
ways reasonably acceptable. There is an
irritating insincerity in his work, and in
spite of his fine bearing, voice and die-*
tlon, his Cardinal Wolsey seems only Ies4
thin than the body of his Macbeth, or lesa
vital than his Shylcck. Clowning It in
Bottom he is a reasonable satisfaction.
Frederick Warde has been classed
among those who rant, but his Mark
Antony is strong and sincere and with
out any undue emphasis. It has helped
generously to conviction the week's per
formance at the California Theater. Tha
Brutus of Charles D. Herman, particular
ly In its later phase, is also worthy, and
more the fine Casslus of Barry John
stone before mentioned.
A TALKNTEO TRAGEDIAN
WHOSE WORK IN "JUl.nJS
CAESAR" WAS EXCELLENT.
The sale of season tickets so far has
been highly encouraging, but, with an
expenditure of $681 for each concert for
orchestra, alone, it can easily be seen that
a very substantial Bupport is required to
make possible this noblest form of musi
cal entertainment. The sale of seats for
the Hofmann recitals is also very good.
and seems to point to the solution that
people arÂ« Intending to take in both af
fairs, or to support the local organization
financially and attend the visiting attrac
tion, or contrariwiseâ which Beems less
likely â to subscribe for the piano recital
and go to the symphony concert. I wish
programme, and it is therefore going to
be quite difficult to choose between the
lodal and visiting attractions next Friday
afternoon. Both will undoubtedly suffer,
for the symphony concert clientele in
cludes practically all the best friends of
the art. who will certainly, therefore, be
those most desirous of doing honor to
the brilliant young pianist, who makes
his first appearance here this week. The
arrangements for both affairs were made
eome time ago and neither is now admis
sible to change. No blame seems to at
tach to either management for the unfor
tunate coincidence, and it is "up to" the
music-lover to do his best under the try
ing circumstances. It may be said that
there will be more symphony concerts
than next Friday, but Mr. Hofmann is
also to be heard again in the near future,
and it is to be remembered that the fu
ture of symphony in San Francisco is
jiow trembling in the balance and will
depend largely upon the support afforded
the present experimental series of con
certs.
THE symphony concert or the Hof
mann recital next Friday after
noon? Is the puzzling Question
for the music-lover this week. We
are unused here to the familiar
Quandary of the concert-goer in large
cities, where choice among a number of
equally attractive musical events has to
be made almost daily. We cannot make
up our minds to resign gracefully any of
the few good things that fall into our
ThÂ© palm for thÂ© year's individual
achievement lies between the Hamlet of
Joseph Haworth and the Iago of Oau
denzlo Salassa. Both Impersonations are
admirable to a degree, and almost of the
greatest, Salassa's the subtler concep
tion. Haworth's ta* more vividly fea
tured. Despite the comparative arti
ficiality of his medium, thÂ© naturalism of
the singer's embodiment is no lew mark
ed than the admirable realism of thÂ© ac
tor's characterization, and Salassa's Iago,
with its ample Shakespearean grasp, grim
humor, . supple cynicism and Latin grace,
leaving out of -the question entirely its
vocal beauty, must be reckoned with all
but the greatest work done In the name
of the master.
. Full of conscience, dignity and high in
telligence- is Mr. Haworth's "Hamlet "
and not less distinguished for elocution
ary charm. His delivery is as far re-'
moved from thÂ© artificial accent that
mars the otherwise excellent Casslus of
Barry Johnstone, that we have had this
wee*k, as it is from the vicious colloquial
ism or rant of other actors who may rest
WHEN in doubt play Shakespeare
seems no ill rule for the theatri
cal manager to take to heart and
"chew upon," as Brutus puts it.
The year of January, 1901. to
January. 1902. holds a round dozen of lo
cal Shakespearean productions of more or
less merit, but all reasonably successful
so far as financial results go, some
conspicuously so. . It is doubtful, for
example. If the Grand Opera-house
has held bo large houses at any
time during Its dramatic season of the
year as for "Hamlet" and "The Merchant
of Venice," given there during the engage
ment of Joseph Haworth last November.
So, too, the California box-offlce is mak
ing no complaint to-day of Shakespearejs
drawing power from the current week Â¦
experiences with Frederick "Wards letting
"loose tho dogs of war" In "Julius Cae
sar." And I doubt not that Mr. Warde's
"King Lear" of last night looked out
upon an audience that even the flame
haired and auburn-moraled "Zaza" would
not have despised. At least things looked
that way when I interrogated the smiling
management on the subject. It is to be
remembered, too, that "Sapho" saw no
larger houses' last year at the Alcazar
with Florence Roberts dragging her stiff
necked victim, Ernest Hastings, and later
the goo-goo-eyed White Whlttlesey.
down to the eternal dum-dums. than It
did with the same lady cleverly shrewing
it as Katherine in "The Taming of thÂ©
Shrew," or inviting neumonia on a bal
cony in "Borneo and Juliet." Neither
does the "through by daylight or I'll bust
the boilers" drama do any better busi
ness up at the Central Theater than did
"Julius Caesar" last year with Robert
Downing as Mark Antony and the house
company in support.
It Is true that neither thÂ© Kldder-
James engagement of last year, with
"ThÂ© Midsummer Night's Dream" as
menu, nor the Modjeska-James engage
ment of this year, with "Macbeth,"
"Henry VIII" and "The Merchant of Ven
ice" for fare, has been what without
stretching could be called brilliantly suc
cessful. Still all the performances eas
ily bear comparison in their financial
takings with the best two modern plays
of last year, "Mrs. Dane** Defense" and
"A Royal Family," which is no bad
record. â
Perhaps, as holding mayhap the best
Shakespearean characterization of the
year, the "Otello" at the Tivoll should not
be omitted, though Salassa's subtle Iago
la sung not spoken, and the magic of Ver
di is added to the wizardry of Shakes
peare. But every onÂ© knows that thÂ©
"Otello" is always onÂ© of thÂ© Tivoli's best
lures to the multitudes. Grau, too, contrib
uted his Shakespearean Quota, giving us
the operatic "Romto and Juliet," that even
thÂ© Iollipopular setting of Gounod haÂ»
not wholly deprived of wonder and charm.
and that stood by no means last In f a
vor in the Grau repertoire. Altogether,
"Zaza" and company, not to speak of the
pinchbeck heroisms and emotions of the
"Janice Meredith" school. . the fluffs . and
frills of "Florodora" and the IlkÂ© expen
sively pettlcoated productions, thÂ© thrills
of "Under Two Flags" and so forth, have

The reports are the more curious because they are not accompanied by any statements of
unusual warmth. The New England papers record sleighing and skating events just as usual,
notwithstanding the appearance of the robins. ; It is up to the naturalist to explain the move
ments^ of the birds. Something has set the robinsand the butterflies to join the winter gayeties of
Boston and St.^Petersburg, and it ought to be inquired into.
A short time ago the New Haven Palladium noted that wild geese that went south late
last fall are already returning to' the north/and have made their appearance in New England. That
fact in itself was interesting, but the return of the geese has been followed by that of other birds.
The Boston Globe says that since the middle of January quite a number of robins have been ob
served in that city. It also notes the reappearance of flie3 that do not usually haunt Boston homes
and offices at this season. of the year. .-".- - - ""â¢.-/
. From Europe come stories still more . strange. ' The Westminster Gazette reports frequent
instances, of nest building by robins and other birds in various parts 'of England, and cites two
cases where the young have actually been hatched. Finally from St. Petersburg, where the Rus
sian winter usually renders it almost impossible for any but the hardiest animals to survive
in the open air in January, the report comes of numbers of butterflies seen disporting themselves
in the park's and seeming to enjoy the weather.

That disaster is far off in the future. For the present let it be understood that Oakland
nights are harmless and Oakland married folks need not show up at home unless their money
gives out. So long as they can afford it, they may chase bats or do what they choose. "Out all
night" is to be the motto of the city. The courts approve it and Mrs. Grundy has left town.
... While Oakland may be felicitated upon these judicial dispersions of the suspicion brought
upon her by the Police Judge who fined himself for staying out all night, the consequences are
apt to bring about something like a wholesale desertion of the homes of the city. If no wife have
a right to inquire where her husband passes the night, and no husband a right to ask where his
wife sleeps or dances from dewy eve till morning light, there is going to be many a deserted
hearth where once two happy hearts reposed in one another and mutually confided all
their secrets. "
Under such circumstances it is gratifying that the influences of Oakland nights have been
brought into court and duly subjected to judicial investigation and decision. A short time ago in
a divorce case Judge Ogden decided that the fact that an Oakland man stayed out all night with
out accounting to his wife was not good ground for divorce; and now Judge Hall has decided
that if an Oakland woman stay out all night and decline to give a true account of herself, her hus
band cannot^on that ground divorce her. Thus being out all night in -Oakland is not a sufficient
cause for divorce on the part of either husband or wife. The nights therefore must be harmless.
Among all the breezes that blow and linger over the mudflats and amid the rose gardens of the
city there is not one that breathes a breath of suspicion.upon the wanderer of the night. What
ever she may be by day, Oakland by starlight is above reproach.
Out of that discussion it came about that Oakland nights got to be looked upon as.some
thing queer. There was 'a widespread belief that through the streets and the byways of our
sister city there radiated after 'dark something more than the shine of the stars and the gleam of
gas and electric lights. San Francisco wives whose husbands had business on the. other, side of
the bay got into the habit of insisting they should return before dark, and even in Oakland itself
it seems a dread grew up, and any one known to have been out all night was looked upon with
suspicion by Mrs. Grundy.
,~.The issue was never settled,; though the /opinion -prevailed that the bat : theory had the
worst of the argument. It was pointed out that; Police Judges and perhaps other Judges had
chased bats all the long night through in San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, Sacramento and
Los Angeles, but had never found it necessary to fine themselves next morning; while on the
other hand, so the argument ran; no one ever wandered about Oakland at night without having a
peculiar experience, .whether chasing a bat or not.
ONCE upon. a time, as will be Well remembered, a Police Judge in Oakland fined himself
$50 in open court for having spent the night chasing a bat. The incident made a pro
found impression upon the public mind. * It attracted a great deal of attention from
those who are inclined to the study of natural phenomena, and whose minds are
aroused by anything that appears unusual or abnormal. Some investigators concluded that the
effect upon the mind of the Judge was produced by the bat; but others held that it would have
been just the same had there been no bat. They contended that there are certain influences which
exhale from Oakland nights which thrill the nerve centers of even the most callous and produce
diverse effects according to the temperament of the person acted upon. '
NIGHTS IN O-A-KZL-AJSTO.
Her success was immediate. She drop - 1
ped Into the role with the ease of a vet
eran and has Blnce filled all Its require
ments with utmost aplomb. The former
Fresno girl is an actress of refreshing
naturalness and bouyancy. and sings with
ease and charm in a voice that is better
than its use. The "Wood Nymph and the
River God," one of the dainUest of comlo
opera lyrics, shows Miss Berri at her
vocal best. It Is charmingly sung, with
taste, sympathy and full vocal mastery.
There seems no good reason for the oc
casional harshness that mars the singer's
tone quality, for some of her notes, es
pecially in the upper range and in all of
her pianissimos, are admirably sweet.
She has a good compass, with particu
larly useful upper notes, and, barring the
sometimes stridency before mentioned, Is
one of the most attractive comic opera
singers that have been heard here, and a
"credit to her country."
Until two or three weeks ago the role
of the Princess Chic has been sung by
Marguerite Sylva, who has taken care of
the part ever since the first production of
the opera, more than' a year ago. But
two or three weeks ago in Denver Miss
Sylva disappeared from .the cast and
Miss Berri, then singing at Castle Square,
was called upon at shortest notice to take
the part.
"The Princess Chic" at the Columbia
naturally gains largely In importance
here from the presence at the head of the
cast of Miss Maude Lillian Berrl, a clever
young woman who hails from Fresno.
The circumstances of her engagement are
peculiar and interesting.

members only one new etar, Harold Gor
don, the tenor. Jtr. . Gordon should be

the case,, as his chief instructor, Sbrlglla,
was also Jean de Reszke's principal
teacher. Anna Lichter returns after a
two years' absence, and with almost two
years' study in Germany to the good. The
clever young woman should be singing
very well now, as she knew how to sing
before she went away, and with two
years' additional study should take very
high place among comic opera lights.

It is of course the aim of the St. Louis people to make their exposition larger and better
than any which has preceded it. That aim \s reasonably sure of accomplishment. In the natural
order of things such expositions ought to improve. As industry advances, transportation facili
ties improve, and the nations draw nearer together through commerce, it is always easier in each
succeeding year to arrange for a larger industrial display. St. Louis is making full use of the im
provements that have been made in all lines of industry since the Paris Exposition. She has raised
a larger sum of money than was ever before used for such purposes, and has planned the build
ings and the surrounding grounds upon a scale of unequaled magnitude and magnificence.
It is gratifying to know that preparations are under way to provide for California an ex
hibit at the exposition which will be worthy of her vast resources and of the splendid opportunity
the exposition will afford to attract capital and settlers to the State/In making such prepara
tions every county should actively aid. It is to be for us a year of golden opportunity, and we
should be prompt to profit by it. Â¦
The exposition authorities are now trying to overcome the objections of those European
governments which have thus far declined to participate. Even should such efforts fail, how
ever, the situation would not be so bad as may be supposed. The failure of the governments to
take part in the exhibit would not mean a failure on the part of the manufacturers and producers.
From every country in the world a good exhibit is already assured, and in order to put an end
to all rumors of postponement the St.. Louis committee recently "adopted a resolution declaring:
"That under the act of Congress and under eVery plan of the board of directors and the executive
committee the exposition will open and close in the year 1903."
The statement of President Francis is the more important because he has been quoted as
advocating a postponement. It appears from the report that some of the European
governments in reply to invitations to exhibit have declined on the ground that the time is insuffi
cient for them to make arrangements. When' asked whether under such cir
cumstances St. Louis could not make a better exposition in 1904 than in 1003 he answered tnat
it could. The reply was misunderstood and taken as a declaration in favor of postponement/when
the president meant it as nothing more than a statement of the self-evident truth that the more
time given to preparation the better would be the result. He holds/ however, that while something
would be gained by delay, much would be lost, and that it is' better to hold the exposition at the
time fixed by Congress and announced by the President in his proclamation inviting foreign
countries to participate.
PERSISTENT reports that the opening of the St. Louis Exposition will have to be post
poned until 1904 have brought from ex-Governor Francis, president of the exposition
company, an emphatic statement that there will be no postponement, that the exposition
will not only open at the date originally fixed, but will be in good shape on the open
ing day.

A GOOD CHANGE
A diange of rood Works "Wonders.
Th& wrong food and drink cause a lot
of trouble in this world. To change the
food is the first duty of every person that
Is ill, particularly from stomach and ner-
vous troubles. As an illustration: A lady
In Hickxnon Mills, Mo., has, with her
husband, been brought around to health
egaln by leaving off coffee and some arti-
cles of food that did not agree with them.
They began using Postum Food Coffee
and Grape-Nuts Breakfast Food.
She says: 'Tor a number of years I
suffered with stomach and bowel trouble
which kept getting worse until I was
very ill most of the time. About four
years ago I left off coffee and began tak-
ing Postum. My stomach and bowels im-
proved right along, but I was so re-
duced in flesh and so nervous that the
least thing would overcome me.
"Then I changed my food and began
using Grape-Nuts Breakfast Food in ad-
dition to my Postum Coffee. I live*d on
'Â¦ hese two principally for about four
months. Day by day I sained in flesh
and strength until now the nervous trou-
ble has entirely disappeared and I feel
that I owe my life and health to Postum
and Grape-Nuts.
"Husband Is 73 years old and he was
troubled for a, long time with occasional
cramps, and Blept badly. Finally I pre-
vailed upon him to leave off coffee and
take Postum. He stood out for a long
lime, but after he tried Postum for a few
days he found that he could sleep and
that { his cramps disappeared. He was
tfatisfied and has never had coffee since.
"I have a brother in California who has
been using Postum for several years; his
'Â«-hole family use it also because they
liave bad euch g-ood results from It."-WASHINGTON, Jan. .23.â The Senate Com

weather. Snow fell at various points in
these States and high winds prevailed.
In California the mercury fell lower
than at any time during the winter. It
Is predicted that this morning will be

CHRISTIANIA, Norway, Jan. 25.â A pro
posal has been Introduced in both the Nor
wegian Storthing and Swedish Rlxdag to ap
point a committee to consider the question of
a permanent neutrality of the dual monarchy.
A report reached here to-night that the
timbering in the tunnel had caught fire
and was burning. In that event traffic
will be delayed many hours. The wreck
age of the two trains fills the tunnel and
the demolished cars probably will be en
tirely consumed. No trains will get
through to-night.
Passenger train No. 1 is held at Serrano
and may not reach San Francisco until
late to-morrow afternoon.
The two trains met in â¢ tunnel No. 2
while going at full speed. Both engines
were demollahed. Fireman Joseph Mc-
Carthy of the gravel train was caught be
tween the engine and the tank. His back
was broken and he was terribly mangled.
Notwithstanding his awful injuries he
lived to reach this city, being conveyed
hither on a farm wagon driven by Fire
man Symmorfs of the fast freight, who
was himself Injured. McCarthy died at
6 o'clock, just after the wagon had ar
rived In San Luis Obispo. He was about
25 years of age and a native of Castro
ville. where his parents reside.
Conductor Datis was in charge of the
fast freight and Engineer Thyle was at
the throttle. Conductor Schrader and En
gineer Laing were in charge of the gravel
train. It has been impossible to-night to
lif responsibility for the disaster, which
evidently was due to confusing orders or
to disobedience on the part of one of the
crews. Engineer Lalng was badly cut
on the left hand and the engineer and
fireman of the freight were injured, but
their hurts are not serious.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Jan. 25.â One man
was killed and several slightly injured at
4 o'clock this afternoon in a head-end col
lision between freight train No. 244 (the
fast freight for New Orleans) and a gravel
train working between Goldtree and Santa
Marguerita. The collision occurred in
tunnel No. 2, eight miles from San Luis
Obispo. The freight, running on regular
time, was ordered to pass No. 1, tne
north-bound passenger, at Goldtree. . The
gravel train, running on signal orders and
not knowing that the fast freight had
orders to pass the passenger train at
Goldtree, attempted- to reach Cuesta sid
ing, north of tunnel No. 1, and there let
the passenger pass.

PLENTIFUL PRECIPITATION.
This destruction of property was caused
chiefly by the breaking of log booms at
Read & Buchanan's mill, near the
smelter. A heavy north-west wind car
ried the logs straight toward the founda
tions of the mills, where they were thrown
about as playthings by the waves. Some
of them were hurled shoroward to a
height of eighty feet. , â¢
Heavy logs were crushed and twisted
and piles were broken off as though they
were pipestems.
The North Tacoma Shingle Company
suffered heavy damage by the undermin
ing of Us mill. Its log chute was broken
down.
Still greater damage was caused by the
undermining of the new shingle mill of
Carlson & Co. The mill was destroyed,
Its foundations being knocked from be
neath It by a boom of logs that broke
loose and were driven against piles by
the surging waves. Part of the old mill
fell Into the bay from the same cause,
carrying' Its machinery with It. A dry
kiln Qlled with shingles was wrecked and
thrown into the sound.
TACOMA, Jan. 25.â Damage estimated
at $20,000 was caused last night and
this morning at Old Tacoma by the
tail end of the blizzard that swept over
Puget Sound. Among, the novel effects
visible this morning was that of a large
grocery store floating down the bay and
out toward the sea. This store was yes
terday located at the end of the city
wharf at Old Tacoma, which Is leased by
the grocery firm of Johnson Brothers.
They do a large business with Sound
steamers and country towns, keeping both
the store and a warehouse filled with
stock.
JLast night the wind and beating of the
logs against its foundations combined to
undermine the city wharf on which the
grocery store stood. Part of it fell in,
leaving the outer portion, on which the
grocery rested, afloat in the bay. One of
the owners -was In the store when the
wharf went down. He remained aboard
the floating provision emporium all night
and was up bright and early this morning
trying to engage help from the shore. As
early as possible a tug was sent out to
his relief and the grocery store was
hauled back to the wharf.
5 At Moran's 'yards were moored the
steamships Oresron, Roanoke, Cutch and
Willamette and the ocean-going tug
Wanderer. All except the Cutch and Wil
lamette were more or less seriously dam
aged. The Roanoke and the Oregon were
tied side by side on the western face of
the dock and received a fearful pounding.
As yet a marine survey of the steamers
has not been held, but it is known that
the Oregon suffered the most damage. The
Roanoke lost a part of her rails and bul
warks and may have been strained. The
"Wanderer beat up against the dock,
smashing in her bulwarks, broke down
sections of piling and Is damaged to the
extent of $2500. ,
Grocery-Store Afloat
The Stetson-Post mill was shut down
during the day and six tugs irom the
Stevenson ana Bleekum fleet were en
gaged in capturing the logs, which were
adrift. Twelve sections broke away, and
to-day they were scattered over the bay
so thickly that it was dangerous for the
smaller craft to venture out at all. Karly
in the morning the sight along the water
front was an Interesting one. The bay
was covered by floating logs, and here
and there could be seen bits of wreckage.
The tugs formed in a great loop connect
ed by a line of logs, and as they steamed
up along- the water front all the stray
logs were caught In the circuit.
There were only a few docks that en
tirely escaped damage. The most serious
damage was sustained by Galibralth-
Uacon's new pier, Lllly-Bogardus' pier,
Jones wharf and Myers' cannery. At
each of the four piers the estimate of
damage Is placed at not less than $1000,
and at Myers' the tin shop went down.
There several large fishing-boats were
wrecked.
Yesterday's storm damages on the Se
attle water front aggregate $40,000. Acci
dents and disasters were numerous and
of a varying character, including every
thing from the smashing of a small row
boat to the loss of a large steamer, the
E. D. Smith.
Wreckage on the Water Front.
The accident occurred while the Main
lander was enroute to tnis city from Van
couver. Ihe worst weather was not met
until the voyage lmd Deen partially com
pleted, and between the banning storm
and ine impossibility ot steering in any
straight course tne steamer rtnaiiy
brought up on the sands of the island
shore. No one was injured in the mis
hap. None ot .the Dassengers ana crew
Wfci-e in any danger at any time.
The captain wires that the passengers
will be brought to this city to-morrow on
the steamer State of Washington. Re
garding the present condition of the Main
lander, he says she can be easily towed
back Into the water. The local officials
expect to have her ln commission again
by Monday night.
SEATTLE, Jan. 25.â The Sound steamer
Mainlander, operated between this city,
Port Townsend and Vancouver, went
ashore on the beach of St. Claire Island,
in the lower Sound, early yesterday morn-
Ing 1 , during the snowstorm and gale which
swept the entire Northwest. The local
officials first heard of the vessel's mishap
to-day, when a telegram was received
from the captain, stating that the steamer
was resting easily upon a sandy bottom,
and, so tar as could be ascertained, was
not damaged.

A. New Catarrh Curs Secures
National Popularity in Less
Than One Year.
Throughout a grrÂ«at nation of eighty million
it is a desperate struggle to secure even a rec-
ognition for a new article, to say nothing of
achieving; popular favor, and yet within one
year Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, the new catarrh
cure, has met with such success that to-day it
can be found in every drug store throughout the
United States and Canada.
To be sure, a large amount or advertising was
necessary ln the first instance to bring the rem-
edy to the attention of the public, but every one
familiar with the subject knowa that advertis-
ing alone never made any article permanently
successful. It must have ln addition abso-
lute, undeniable merit, and this the new ca-
tarrh cure certainly possesses m a marked de-
gree.
Physicians, who formerly depended upon in-
halers, spraya and local washes or ointments,
now use Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, because, as
one or the most prominent stated, these tablets
contain ln pleasant, convenient form all the
really efficient catarrh remedies, such as red
gum, blood root and similar antiseptics
They contain no cocaine nor opiate, and are
Klven to little children with entire safety and
benefit.
Dr. J. J. Reltlger of Covington, Ky./mra- "I
Buffered from catarrh ln my nead and throat
every fall, with stoppage of the nose and Irrita-
tion ln the throat, affecting my voice and often
extending to -the stomach, causing catarrh of
the stomach. I ' bought a 60 cent nack&se nf
Btuarfs Catarrh Tablets at my druggUt*. car
ried them ln my pocket and used them faithful
ly. and the way in which they cleared my head
and throat was certainly remarkable. I had no
catarrh last winter and spring and consider my
self entirely free, from any catarrhal trouble "
Mrs. Jerome Ellison of Wheeling \v Va
writes: "I suffered from catarrh nearly mv
whole life, and last winter my two children
also suffered from catarrhal colds and iom
throat so much they were out of school a Iarire
portion of tbe winter. -' My brother, who was
.cured of catarrhal deafness by using Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets, urged mÂ« to try them so much
that I did so and am truly thankful for what
thoy have done for myself and my children
I always keep a box of the tablets in the bouse
and at 'the first appearance of a cold or sore
throat we nip it in the bud and catarrh is no
longer a household affliction with us." â¢
Kull sised packages of 8tuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets are sold for 60 cents at all druggist*. ' .' Â¦ Â¦

While the talent figured well In the

favorites were beaten out, some twenty
short ends being recorded.
The special stake brought out a course
that will go on record as one of the Dest
of the season. In the trial between A. J.
Hartln and Sacramento Boy the specta
tors were treated to as fine a contest as
has been seen on a coursing field. Slipped
to a hare of unusual speed, the hounds
were forced to show their best work.
Sacramento Boy took the lead and cams
In for a turn or two. The younger grey
hound took possession and by the clever
est of work pressed the hare closely and
ran up a good score. Both dogs were well
backed at comparatively even money, and
during the exciting trial kept their back
ers enthused by their interesting working
of the hare. Though Sacramento Boy dis
played unusual cleverness, his young op
ponent outpointed him and won the
course. Many of the followers of the game
declared the trial the best exhibition seen
on the grounds since the memorable one
in which yesterday's loser beat the great
Beacon in the deciding course of the John
Urace challenge cup.
The hares liberated in the rundown of
the two stakes at Union Coursing Park
yesterday did not show any ill effects
from the cold weather. Throughout the

home golf tournament between the ladies'
annexes of the San Francisco and Oak
land golf clubs, played yesterday morn
ing on* the Presidio links, the city team
scored 9 up. As the Adams â¢ Point rep

was decided in favor of Oakland, 1 up.
The visiting team was composed of the
same eight players as on Saturday, the
18th Inst., though the last three did not
play in. the same order. In the first half
of the match on the Adams Point liuks

on the two days' play was 20 up and for
San Francisco 19 up. 1
The Presidio course is in almost perfect
condition, the turf being springy and
strong. A stiff north wind blew over the
links, but did not deter a large number
of ladies from following the contestants
. around the course. After the : match
nearly forty ladles lunched in the club
house. The victory of the visitors was
largely due to MiS3 Moore's defeat of
Miss Drum, 5 up, as. until her score was

Track Notes.
Marcato received a nose decision over
Nellie Forest in the concluding race* of
the day. The old horse stood a long drive
and Bullman snatched the verdict by the
scantest of margins. The winner opened
favorite, but when a plunge was made
'on Nellie Forest his odds went back to 3.
Away poorly, Merops ran a good third.
"Plunger" Lewis unloaded quite a
chunk of coin on Marineuse to win the
fifth event, and the gelding ended up <n
third place, backed down to 11 to 5 favor

shot, to the front soon after the start
and, stalling off the challenge of Screen
well Lake, crossed the line winner by a
length. It was the latter mare's first
start this season. Had the distance been
greater, she might have outstayed Beren

Most of the fields nad an open look, and
none of the favorites were quoted at ex

fortunate, as Duke of York and Sylvia

Dwight Way looked a winner to within a

The tennis players of the Lowell High
School met yesterday on the courts of the
California Club. . Carl Gardner won all
his matches handily. He was then called
upon to play Al Rosenberg to determine
who will represent the school In doubles
In the annual tournament of the Academic
Athletic League. Rosenberg, who is con
ceded to be the best player in the school,
won. â¢
By winning the tournament Gardner is
entitled to a place on the doubles team
.with Rosenberg. The game played by
Gardner was a surprise, although It was
known he has been improving steadily.
In the finals he took the first two sets
from Rosenberg handily and it seemed he
would win the match. Rosenberg did not
exert himself in the first two sets but in
the next two he played his best and his
opponent was able to secure only one
game. The last set was close, but Rosen
berg was the steadier of the two and won.
The winner has played but little in the
past year and was out of practice. The
score in Rosenberg's favor was 5-7, 3-6.
6-0, 6-1 6-4. .

Cardinal Team Loses Baseball Match
to Santa Clara Nine. ;
' .SANTA CLARA. Jan. 25.â Stanford Uni
v'ersity baseball team â¢was defeated here
to-day by the Santa Clara College nine by
a score of 13 to 7. The game was played
with dash and determination on eacn side.
In" the fifth inning the score waa 7 to. 1.
Hits were frequently made off each pitch
er. Several times with the bases full the
side was retired on a pop fly.- Cutter, who
was expected to pitch for Santa- Clara,
hod a lame arm and played first base.
The teams were made up as follows:
STANFORD IS DEFEATED.
The successful trip to this coast of the
Michigan football team to play Stanford
at Pasadena has resulted In the manage
ment planning already for another visit.
It is almost a foregone conclusion they
will play in this city next November.
It is believed the representatives of the
University of California will agree to the
majority of the suggestions offered by the
Stanford men.
Giving the baseball umpire the same powers
as 'are given the referee in football games with
regard to disqualifying players.
Define more clearly those who 'shall be con
sidered "partial" or "limited" students.
. Define university standing.
Regulate the issue of side line passes for
football and other athletic contests. :â¢. â¢.'Â£
â¢ A- one-year residence rule for men who have
represented any other university In an athletic
contest.' - . ' ,
/Allowing men to compete in intercollegiate
athletics lor only four years regardless of what
university they may have represented.
''". Under the existing agreement the next
intercollegiate football contest must be
held on Berkeley campus. It is. desired to
change this to. permit of the game being
played in this city, where the receipts
would be larger than across the bay.
-The Stanford representatives desire a
stronger rule covering the eligibility of
students from other schools and univer
sities .--â¢ entering athletic competition.
Among the changes they propose are the
following:
r" There '.were many questions to be dis
cussed -and as one of the delegates could
not sparfi the time necessary the meeting
adjourned, the committee agreeing to
meet at Berkeley Tuesday night.
, The-Unlversity of California was repre

to All Who Write.
Free trial packages of a most remark-
able remedy are being mailed to all who
will write to the State Medical Institute.
They cured so many men who had battled
for years against the mental and physical
suffering of lost manhood that the Insti-
tute has decided Â° to distribute free * trial

cele or emaciation of parts can now cure
themselves at home. - ' '
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development just where it is needed.
It cures all the Ills and troubles that come
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute success in
all cases. A request to the State Medical

plied with promptly. The Institute is de-
sirous of reaching that great class of men
who are unable Â¦ to leave' home to-be
treated, and the free samples will enable
them to see how easy, it Is to be cured of
sexual weakness when -.the proper reme-
dies are employed. The Institute makes
no restrictions. Any man who writes will
be sent a free sample, carefully sealed in

I His Discovery That "Electricity Is the Basis of Life" Is Not |
|| New. Dr. McLaughlin Claims It. In Books Written Three â¢
|| Years Ago He Offers Proof of the Influence of Electricity g
|| Upon Human Vitality. Old Age Can Be Defied. By Dr. Me- g
; Laughlin's Method; Electricity May Be Used to Renew Youth S
; end P rolect the Body From Disease. Note the Comparison Â§
! Between Prof. Loeb's New Theories and Dr. McLaughlin's S
I Old Ones. Â§
1 Prof. Loeb of the University of Chicago recently announced that he had 9
l discovered that electricity was the basis of life. Â©
He said that the motion of the heart was due. not to the heat, but to the â¢
1 electricity in the body. Â©
â¢ "A part of the chemical energy of foodstuffs 13 transformed Into electrical â¢
â¢ energy, which in turn gives energy to the muscles and organs of the body." â¢
> The announcement that electricity and not heat is the life of the climax â¢
1 of Prof. Loeb's experiments, which have extended over ten years. Â©
â¢ These results, he says, are going to upset most of the teachings of the Â©
) textbooks of physiologyâ that is. they are going to expose the fallacy of med' **
1 icine as it is administered by the regular physician of to-day. â¢ â¢
1 . â¢** ~ ! Â©
Effect o? Dp. McLaughHrTs Treatment Upon Men. â¢
1 This is all In line with Dr. McLaughlin's teachings, which have been In Â©
1 print for the' past ten years. Dr. McLaughlin has been a student of this sub- Â©
â¢ ject for twenty years,- and has made his observations from cases under per- Â©
1 sonal treatment. * â¢ â¢ S
1 â¢ In his book, written three years ago (In his Introductory remarks), he x
1 says: "I anticipate still greater results from my efforts to demonstrate the S
1 truth of my- life-long claim that electricity is the basis of all animal vitality, ?
' and without it we could not live." 2
1 .. In another part of his book Dr. McLaughlin gives a more comprehensive S
â¢ solution of the heat problem than that advanced by Prof. Loeb. Dr. Me- 5?
1 Laughlin says: â¢ " -'5
â¢ "The food that we eat Is treated as fuel by the stomach, Just as Is the q
coal in a furnace. The chemical action which la produced upon the food by q
the acids and juices of the stomach burns the food and causes a carbonic q
1 heat. This heat is electricity, and It is forced into the nerves and vital or- 5f
1 - gans and. is their life." g
â¢ - Â¦" . Farther, Dr. McLaughlin says: "The electrical heat generated by the con- 2
â¢ sumption of our food should keep healthy every vital organ of the body. De- 2
f . bility of the vital organs arises when the waste Is greater than the repairâ Â©
1" when the stomach is not able to generate sufficient electrical heat to supply Â©
I- the demands of nature. 0
, "This excessive waste Is due to overtaxation of the vital forces by hard O
1 work mentally, grief or worry, extra, physical exertion, severe fevers, such as A
: typhoid or malaria, which drain away the vitality and leave the system de- a
- bilitated." 2
' Now here is where Dr. McLaughlin passes beyond the period covered by a
' Prof. Loeb and shows how this vital electricity, which is the basis of life, may 2
> be replaced in the body when lost by the causes producing debility. *<*
> : He says: "When the stomach Is not able to generate sufficient of this en- 5
> ergy to supply the demands of the vital organs, the natural result Is a lower- V
> ing of nerve, organic and muscular powerâ a general debility. Then an artl- â¢
> ficial agent must be used to assist the stomach. That agent Is the Dr. Me- Â©
I Laughlin Electric Belt." |j
> The human body charged with this electrical force is proof against the #
1 debility usually foreshadowing the decay of old age. There can be no decay a
1 where there Is sufficient force to keep the heart and vital organs active, and a
: under Dr. McLaughlin's treatment men of 75 and 85 years have found a new Z
j lease of life. Jj
An old man who had been wearing a Dr. McLaughlin belt every night for JÂ®
' two months wrote: "While my age is 70 years, I have become as youthful In Â©
â¢ health as a man of S3, and am able to do as much work. I am really an old Â©
I man made young." Â¦ ; .'Â¦. \j
>.-": Men and women 'who had been rheumatic cripples for years, and whoso Â©
I cases had defied the best doctors, have secured perfect health from Dr. Me- Q
I Laughlin's Belt. q
> H'i Mr. Al Bassatt, Rich Gulch, Cal., writes, January 8, 1902: "My back Is now Q
k as well as it ever was. I have had no pain for the past six weeks. Your Belt a
( is a. wonder." Q
, Dr. McLaughlin has not only proven that * electricity Is the substance of Â«Â£
; life and organic vitality, but has gone so far as to perfect the best known 2Â»
' means of replenishing that force in the body when It is lost. His electric belt *?
' is the natural result of scientific study, coupled with experience and median- Â©
Â» ical skill. â¢
â¢ The current supplied by this appliance enters the body In a slowing stream Â©
> of vitalizing heat, so gentle that the nerves and vital organs absorb It as â¢
â¢ freely as a hungry, babe drinks milk. This force is added to the natural pow- 0
I er generated by the stomach; it saturates every vital part and soon trans- A
I forms the debilitated body into a natural storage battery, which generates a
I its own health and closes the doors forever to disease and debility. JT
. Dr. McLaughlin's book la published for free distribution to those interest- q
, ed in the development of vigorous health in men and women. It is profusely ]Z
' illustrated and describes his method of treatment and appliances. Sent sealed **

â¢ CAUTION â I have to caution you against a certain advertisement offering "an Â©
I electric belt free." Of course it is a snare Intended to deceive persons wishing to O

Rescues Three British Sailors.
Captain Rasmussen of the towboat Sea
King yesterday afternoon picked up three
sailors belonging to the British bark In
vercoe and put them safely, aboard their
ship. They were In a ship's boat and got
caught in the norther which swept the
bay about 2 o'clock. .When Captain Ras
ntussen sighted them they were drifting
down on Alcatraz. They wera exhausted
with the struggle against wind and tide
and their boat was half filled with water.
So weak were the men that It. was with
great difficulty they were helped aboard
the tug. The boat was taken in tow and
during a lull ln the gale the shipwrecked
crew was handed over the side of the In
vercoe. If assistance had not arrived
when It did, says Captain Rasmussen,
the men would certainly have been
drowned, as their boat could not have
lived much longer ln the heavy sea.
Boisterous Norther Sweeps Bay.
A norther Buch as San Francisco has
not seen for many days swept the bay
yesterday afternoon and gave the ship
ping men at the north end of the water
front a. lively shaking up. The storm
reached its height about 2 o'clock and
raged ln howling fury for over an hour.
During the height of the storm walking
on Meig-gs wharf was an undertaking so
full of danger that it was not attempted.
The waves broke over the breakwater at
the new fishermen's wharf, and fiehing
boats under its shelter were filled with
water at their moorings. Several lumber
vessels lying alongside sections A and B
of thÂ© seawall were damaged, and only
saved from shipwreck by strong towboats,

which took them to anchorages ln the
open bay. The schooner Advent was
taken out by the tug Liberty, the tug Sea
King prevented the Gleaner from butting
in her ribs against the Harbor Commis
sioners* property and the timely arrival
of the Alert saved section B from being
ripped apart by the schooner Addenda.
The waves broke over the" latter vessel
and drove ashore the laborers who were
discharging her cargo of lumber. Her
lumber ports were open and several Jieavy
seas Â¦were shipped* before the crew could
get them closed.. Both the Gleaner and the
Advent were badly chafed, and the Ad
denda tore away several piles. The pilot
boat Pathfinder, at anchor off Meiggs
wharf,- had her decks swept repeatedly,
and during the height of the gale was al
most entirely hidden in spray. The scow
6Chooner Fannie lost part of her deckload
of lumber, and the crew of plledriver No.
2. which was in tow of ' the Governor
Markham. had to seek refuge far above
the decks, which were under water. The
brig W. G. Irwln was obliged to leave
Lombard-street wharf and the schooner
Sailor Boy at Oakland long wharf put in
an exciting hour or two. The revenue
cutter Hartley was driven for shelter
among the fishing boats and the General
Sternberg found refuge at the .Pacific
Mall dock. The fishermen were obliged to
abandon their fishing.

HIS British Majesty's gunboat
Phaeton, out on a searching
cruie for the missing sloop of
war Condor, put Into this port
yesterday for coal, informa
tion and further instructions from
the admiral commanding the Pa
cific station. The Phaeton left Es
quimalt last Monday and has been
bucking stormy seas ever since. She
tried to run in to Portland, but was un
able to -cross the Columbia River bar.
Â£he engaged a tug, however, to run in
with 'u, communication to the admiral and
tossed and tumbled outside for several
long hours awaiting an answer. She will
proceed on her cruise this, morning. Â£>e
experienced considerable difficulty CTilniR
in the blusterous norther which yester
day stirred up the bay. Soon after she
diopped anchor the coal laden schooners
Piute and Arthur were taken alongside
and the- Phaeton's Jackies and marines
giive practical demonstration of the pos
s.biiity of coaling ship in a rough sea.
Tlie Piute, which was made fast on the
weather side, stayed with the job until
her ribs were almost staved In. The
norther, which freshened to a smart gale
about 2 o'clock, sent the coalboat bang
ing against the side of King t-dward'e
ship until the safety of botu vessels was
threatened. The work of coaling was fin
ished on the lee side.
The Phaeton will proceed from here ln
the direction of Honolulu, taking as near
ly as possible the course that would most
likely have been taken by the Condor un
der sail. The officers of the Phaeton have
little hope of finding either the Condor
or any trace of her. The Condor, they
say, was so put together that if wrecked
she would go down all in one piece and
they think there is little likelihood of any
wreckage remaining afloat. If ehe went
down, they say, she went with a plunge
and carried with her even her boats. The
Condor is a new vessel and little is
l;nown of her sea-going qualities. She en
countered reugh weather on her voyage
out from England and, according to let
ters written to England by members of
her crew, behaved badly. She carried 125
officers and men. Her officers were: Cap
tain Clifton Sclater, Lieutenants James
B. Mason, Hay Winthrop, Henry V. T.
Proctor; surgeon, T. S. Hartley; assist
ant paymaster, William H. Franlin; gun
ner, Arthur D. A. Burns; engineer, George
J. Ditton. This is her maiden commis
sion.
The Phaeton, which is the first boat
sent by the British naval authorities In
search, has been stationed yp to within
the past few months at Panama. Her
commander is Captain Ernest J. Fleet
and the man depended upon to find the
Condor if she is afloat is Navigating Offi
cer Lieutenant George N. Tomlin. Her
other officers are:
Lieutenant Frederick A. Whltehead. ex
poutive; Lieutenants Osmond J. Prentis,
Charles J. Brendon and Vernon S. Resh
lelgh; Lieutenant Royal Naval Reserve
Newenham R. de la C. Cornwall, Lieuten
ant Royal Marines Harold Ozanere, Chap
lain Rev. J. Steward Borrowdale, M. A.;
Staff Surgeon George H. Foott, M. D ;
Paymaster Robert F. C. Eames, Chief En
gineer George T. Kerswell, Assistant En
gineers Cliff Bowie and John L. Badhaux.
Gunner Herbert T. Leggett, Boatswains
Michael Aharn and W. G. Beer, Carpenter
Samuel Wells and Clerk F. R. Graham.
H. M. S. Egerta, now at Esquimau, has
been ordered to prepare for sea and will
Join the Phaeton in the search. The
eteamBhip Alameda, which sailed yester
day for Honolulu, was under orders to
keep a sharp lookout for the missing ves
sel, and the United States revenue cutter
Hugh McCulloch, which sailed on Friday
Is now searching the Pacific for some &lgn
that will solve the mystery of the Con
dor's fate.
Visitors will be allowed aboard the
Phaeton this afternoon between the hours
of 1 &nd 5.

MEETS DEATH
AT FATAL CURVE
The selection of Fillmore for the respon
elble position was under consideration by
President John Martin of the Xorth Pa
cific Coast Hne for some time past. Al
though Fillmore had r.ot solicited the x ap
pointment his reputation as a railroad
zaan brought him Into favorable notice,
end on Thursday President Martin formal
ly offered him the place. Fillroore took
time to consider the matter, and yester
day announced his willingness to accept
the post If the salary was suitable. Presi
dent Martin told him to fix his own sal
ary, which he did. The terms were satis-
ago, was yesterday appointed
reneral manager of the North Pacific
Coast Railway, the appointment to go
into effect to-morrow.
-ry A- FILLMORE, for many years
I J general manager of the Soutn
i I ern Pacific, from which position
f^J/ O he resigned some six months
WALLA WALLA
WRECK A PUZZLE
Flllmore's selection for the important
post Â¦will be gratifying to his many friends
as well as to those who -witnessed his re
tirement from the Southern Pacific with
regret. He had been connected with that
company for thirty years, and he res : gned
with the direct understanding that he'
would receive $500 a month during his re
tirement. The company failed to keep
this agreement, for reasons best known to
the management. When the offer to man
age the affairs of the North'Pacific Coast
line was made to Fillmore he promptly
accepted it. Fillmore will assume his du-
factory and President Martin ' made the
appointment without loss of time. '
"I regard the appointment as one which
will be satisfactory to the traveling pub
lic," said President Martin yesterday.
"Manager Fillmore is one of the best rail
way men In the United States, and we are
glad to Eecure his services. His' ability
will be of great service to the company
now that it has been decided to make
many improvements."
FRISKY FELINES
IN FAIRYLAND
General Manager Fillmore will devote
the greater part of his official time to the
prosecution of these improvements. That
they will result in improving the trans
portation facilities for. the residents of
Mill Valley and other points along the
route goes without saying. ..;___
ties to-morrow at the company's offices at,
14 Sansome street, but -as soon as the
Hay wards building Is ready for occupancy
the offices .will be removed to that com
modious structure.
Since the North Pacific Coast line was
purchased by a syndicate, composed of
Messrs. R. R. Colgate, R. M. Hotaling
William M. Pierson, C. A. Grow. E. J. de
Sabla Jr. and John Martin, the prelimin
ary, work of improving the line has been
progressing steadily. The road will be
modernized in every respect by making it
standard gauge from Sausalito to San An
selmo, with double track. The motive
power will be electricity. Arrangements
for cutting the ties have already been
made and they are being furnished. The
rails have also been ordered, those de
signed for use in the mountains being
sixty-five pounds in weight, while thqse
that are to be laid in tho valleys will have
a Â¦weight - of seventy pounds. The mate
rials for the improvements are now on the '
way to the ground, so that within a few
months the residents along the route will
witness a complete transformation of the
line. - . ' ; - Â»Â¦ â¢ .
Attorney Ruef, on behalf; of Mayor
Schmitz and Powcl Fredrick, filed a de
murrer, to "the writ, .the principal points
advanced being that the acts of the,Maj
or were not judicial and -therefore could
not be subject to review, tj*- the couri.
Ruef informed Judge (%>k | that in 're
gard to the portion of the writ restrain
ing the Mayor and Fredrick - from further
proceedings. It was his Intention to make
a return on the same and serve copies on
Attorney Rlordan and former Clerk Wil
liams and asked for a continuance.
A ! conference between counsel finally re
sulted ".in an, agreement that each side to
the Justices' clerk r imbroglio -would re
main passive until | Judge Cook heard tho
arguments on the writ of certiorari.' By
consent of all Â¦ parties, - Judge : Cook then
set the hearing of the writ of review for
next Friday morning. , ' ... - .
Under the. terms of the verbal stipula
tion.' Mayor- Schmitz will -not- place "Wil
liams on trial' Monday, and the suspended
clerk- and his attorney, Riordarr, will not
Files Demurrer to Writ.
Â¦ In hearing the contempt . proceedings
Judge Cook would not' allow any . argu
ments as to whether the, Mayor had the
power to suspend and remove Williams
and'name his successor.. That point is to
be decided on -the arguments and hearing
of the writ of certiorari. . - ?
Having disposed of the contempt pro
ceedings. Judge . Cook took , up the hear
ing, of the , writ of ' certiorari. The writ
simply -gives the court the power to re
view the acts of Mayor Schmitz in sus
pending Williams from office and appoint
ing Fredrick in .his place, and . at the
same time . restrains the Mayor from
placing Williams on trial until after the
review by the court.
Therefore, I fail to '.- find that the evidence
tef oro me shows that Mr. ' Fredrick did any
thing in contempt of the writ issued out of
this court. Let the order. to show cause b-.j
vacated.
If that order was given by the direction of
the Mayor I am clearly, of the opinion that
ithe Mayor would be in contempt Of this court
and I would not hesitate to so adjudge, but
the Mayor, has not. been brought .before, this
court for contempt of this e er and there Is
nothing before the court to sl. u w that the clerk
of the Mayor was authorized to give the order
which was given to, the policemen. Certainly
Mr. Fredrick gave no order. He did i oth
ing, and though he was there and continued
to stay there the court did not command him
to leave that office. "All the, court did in the
order, all that appears in the writ in any way
referring to Mr. Fredrick' would be that his
powers as clerk were suspended, which is
merely an adjudication as to his status. There
was not any ' direction to him, either to do or"
not to do anything. - .Â¦Â¦'-.. -. Â¦/' â¢
Thinks Mayor Was ia Contempt.
- According to the evidence here Mr.- Fredrick
did nothing:. He was in the office when the
writ was served and the Mayor's clerk came
Into the office and gave orders to the police
men, saying that he was acting in the name of
the Mayor, to remove -Mr.' Williams. The
Mayor's clerk, however, is not . before me for
contempt, neither is the Mayor. ' . '-, . .,
I am equally satisfied that the . court had
the right to order both of the parties to desist
from any action â further action â In the matter
to be reviewed. . â¢â¢â¢ Â¦â¢' Â¦â¢-..-
I am further satisfied that as to whether
the party whose act' Is sought to be reviewed
had or had not Jurisdiction is a question which
this court Is authorized under the law to pass
upon. It must be passed . upon , by this court,
and; therefore, .until it. has been decided by
this court, the inferior tribunal, board or of
ficer whose action Is Â¦ sought to be reviewed
has no power to determine it~ for himself nor
to undertake to set at defiance the orders of
th superior tribunal. ; Â¦ . Â¦

power y to regulate Â¦ the terms of : county
officers; -such regulation runs from the
time ; the county officials go , into -: office
until they vacate, and that for cause the

has the power.to remove a county, officer

merged - and consolidated Into one municipal

What the Constitution Says.
Chief Justice Beatty dissented from the
opinion and Justice Van Dyke wrote a
dissenting opinion. In which Justice Tem
ple concurred. : The dissenting Justices
held "that under the consolidation act of
1856 all officers who prior to tha-t time had
been' simply county â¢ officers and those
purely city officers were thenceforth alike
officers of the new municipality and I were
thereafter neither officers of the- city of
San Francisco nor I officers of the county
of San Francisco." .' , , v r
By no reasonable Â¦ stretch of construction can
this be held to Include the power to prescribe
the qualifications of such deputies by any mode
or process whatever. - , /
By section 8% power over county officers Is
given to the municipality only to the extent of
providing tor the manner of their election and
their terms of office and compensation. As to
their deputiesâ and they, alone are Involved in
this action â the only power granted is to pro
vide "for the number of deoutles that each
shall . have and tar the compensation - payable
to each of such.veputles." . - â

Justice McFarland and concurred in by
Justices Harrison, Henshaw and Garoutte
bearing on this mooted point Is as fol
lows: Â¦Â¦'Â¦â¢. -â¢'Â¦.'Â¦."
It Is claimed by the "county officials"
that the Mayor- has no power to remove
them from office, while the Mayor and his
advisers entertain opposite views. It is
further claimed by the so-called "county
otticials" that they, are protected by the
decision of the Supreme Court in the cuss
of Crowley against -Freud, when the rul
ing was made that the Civil Service Com
mission of the city and county -of San
Francisco had no power over county offi
cers to compel them to accept as deputies
those who had taken the competitive ex
aminations of the commission. -
Great interest centers in the hearing of
the writ of review, for Judge Cook will
be called upon to decide if the Mayor has
the power to suspend and remove from
otrice any ofliciaia who claim to be "coun
ty officials." That the Supreme Court will
be asked to render a decision on the mat
ter is a foregone conclusion.

Policeman McKeegan, who was In ! the

and was at hand so quickly that the run
ning man was. still in view on Jackson

found Holmston hiding In a room. Holm
ston was taken back to the Brown resi
dence and there : positively identified by
both Mrs. Brown and Miss McDonough
Holmston was then taken to the City
Prison, where he ' will be â¢ held pending
further. investigation by the detectives.
Holmston was sober when he was ar
rested. He said he did not know why he
had been arrested and professed Ignor
ance of the assault. He is unmarried and
has been rooming at the Seventh-street
place .for some time. , ;
In the arrest to-night of Charles J.
Holmston, a carpenter, 45 years old, resid

lieve they have "caught 'at* least one'of the
men who have been terrorizing women on
the streets of this city after dark.
Whether Holmston is the* assailant-.. of
little Flossie White is a question. At any
rate the offense with which he is charged
is sufficient to place him on the . list
of suspects. The victims of his attack
to-night were Mrs. Bert Brown, .wife of

McDonough, who - resides with Mrs.
Brown at Jackson and Fifth streets. . The
ladies were walking along- Jackson street

'My ruling did not' condone the acts of Mrs.
Noy. The question in the case Is this: Would
the fact that Mrs. Noy remained from home
all night twice within four years cause Mr.
Noy grievous mental suffering- or anguish?
The complaint alleges that on these two oc
casions she. told her husband she was at one
place when It was subsequently learned she
was at another. In my opinion these two lone
acts do not constitute extreme cruelty.'.
The couple had been married for four years
and the complaint only alleged that she had
stayed out All I night twice during that period.

that two instances of that sort did not con

Younger is about 80 years of age. He
is a powerful man and' had worked at
harvesting through the autumn. On Tues
day night he went to a variety theater,
and on leaving went to his room. He was
not seen again until Thursday evening,
when he came downstairs half-dressed
and said there were snakes in his room.
Edward Lewis, the clerk, knowing
Younger was not a drinking man. sum
moned the police. Younger's body was
then in semi-rigid condition. ' He was
taken to the police station at midnight.
Throughout Thursday night and Friday
Younger remained In the hypnotic state.
On Saturday morning he was taken to the
County Jail and physicians were sum
moned. They soon detected that Younger
was under . hypnotic . Influence. During
semi-conscious intervals Younger takes
food. Â¦ Â¦ . ' â¢;.
To-night Younger, was in a deep sleep.
His fingers twitched almost constantly
and .he breathed laboriously. His feet and
hands were limber but the rest of his body
was rigid. . â¢ ' *
A i local hypnotist named Rynorson Is
accused by two persons of having put
Younger to sleep on the stage' of a vari
ety tneater on Tuesday night. ' Rynorson
denies the accusation and apparently
wishes to be cleared of the charge, not
witstandlng the advertising such a case
would give him as an exponent of the
mysterious science. â¢,
Two physicians to-day applied many of
the tests used to arouse persons from a
cataleptic state. All efforts failed and
both physicians declare that unless the
person who put Younger to sleep removes
his influence there Is no telling when the
man will recover from his unnatural con
dition.
Who put Younger Into this, sleep and
for what purpose are questions that have
been puzzling the authorities. Physicians
say that if the influence be not with
drawn soon Younger' s mind will be af
fected, as in all cases of continued hyp
notic state the mind is weakened.
SPOKANE, Jan. 25.-On a cot in the
County Jail, sleeping the uncanny sleep
of hypnotism, lies Hans Younger. Since
Tuesday night the unfortunate man â¢ has
been in this unnatural condition. Effort*
of physicias to arouse him are futile:
Special Dispatch to The CalL
Professor John Fryer, liL. . P., deliv
ered : one of those very interesting lec
tures last night which are proving so suc
cessful at the Mechanics' Institute on
Saturday evenings. The title of the lec
ture was "A Trip. to Peking and the
Great Wall of China." It' was the sec
ond part of the lecture and with the illus
trations was much appreciated by a very
large audience. Professor Fryer has a
good delivery and his subject was a pop
ular one, especially since he possesses a
fund of information upon matters per
taining to China and the late trouble
which took the combined forces of civil
ized nations to properly adjust. Peking,
with Its temples and " its Government
buildings, its old places of interest, its
own peculiar library, not endowed by
philanthropists, and the public thorough
fare on which executions are conducted
in full view "of the populace, were a few
of the subjects that kept the audience
deeply .Interested for over an hour. The
professor's illustrations are exceptionally
good and distinct. The pictures of build
ings and notables are in excellent preser
vation and are well reproduced on Â¦ the
screen. There was one set of pictures
which must be particularly interesting to
the amateur astronomer, namely, the pre
sentation of the antique astronomical ma
chines, which are a wonder to behold.
During the late occupation of Peking the
German and French armies took posses
sion of the scientific instruments of an
cient make, but the latter Government re
turned them, said the professor, a.state
ment which was loudly applauded.
An effort was made to nominate two
candidates for Town Trustees to-night,
but It failed, because the club wanted
further time in which to select candidates.
A motion by O. C. Miller that the nomina
tions be made by a nominating commit
tee of fifteen members was carried. Mil
ler said that If the nominations were
made in an open meeting the poolroom
men would have their friends there to stir
up trouble. A committee of fifteen will
be appointed by the executive committee
to assist In piloting the club'* nominees
to victory.
Among those who spoke were Commo
dore C. H. Harrison. George Harlan, O. C.
Miller and W. G. Morrow. The meeting
adjourned to the call of the chair.
The Grand Jury report, wherein the
licensing of poolrooms in Sausalito was
condemned, was mentioned as reflecting
the sentiment of honest men regarding
the conditions existent in the town. -
SAUSALITO, Jan. 25.â The chill ocean
breeze that swept the Sausalito hills did
not stay the ardor of members of the Sau
eallto Municipal Improvement Club to
night, when they met in Geneva Hall to
hear the report of their executive com
mittee and consider- means whereby the
poolsellers could be driven from the com
munity. A. J. Treat, W. G. Morrow,
Frank Jones, George Harlan, J. M. Gll
gara, J. T. Harmes and O. C. Miller com
pose the committee and A. J. Treat made
its report. He denounced the poolroom
element, saying that the coming election
would determine whether the people or
the gamblers should run the town. Treat
declared, that If an election were held'to
day the gamblers would win, owing to the
fact that they had imported voters. The
committee, he said, had been gathering
evidence and expected to be in a position
soon to give certain "colonists" a long
residence in San Quentln.
Treat told how a committee went to
Sacramento and appeared before the last
Legislature to get a bill passed prohibit
ing the sale of pools outside of a race
track. Commenting upon failure of the
bill to pass he said, "We failedâ you may
guess why." . . -
Boeclal Dispatch to The, CalL
Several members of the wealthy Van
derbilt family are expected to pay this
tity a visit early next month. Already the
Vanderbilts are making preparations in
New York for the long trip across the
continent. A special train will bring the
party to this city. Four of the best suites
of rooms In the Palace Hotel were en
gaged yesterday afternoon for the ac
commodation of the visitors during their
etay In this city. The apartments which
were yesterday ordered for the party are
the best the big local hostelry affords.

when the vanderbilts will leave New York
Is not known here, nor Is the object of
their visit. It is presumed, however, that
the party Is simply coming here to spend
the remainder of the winter .traveling
through California, although it Is not Im
probable that some of the male members
of the family may have some important
business to attend to here in connection
Â¦with tneir vact railroad and other hold
ings.
Herman Oelrichs of this city, who is a
brother-in-law of William K. Vanderbilt,
was the person to whom the task of se
curing comfortable apartments at the
Palace- for the party was Intrusted. None
of the Vanderbilt family has visited this
coast for almost two years. The last
member of the famous family who paid a
visit to this city was young Alfred Gwynn
Vanderbilt. who passed through here on
his Â¦way to New York from Japan shortly
after the death of his father.

with some of Morgan's English lines.
"Naturally," he said, "It Is to America's

Schwab's observations In France, Italy
and Austria, and now in Germany, have
confirmed his belief that their external
markets will inevitably become the United

Schwab's general survey of the inter
national situation.
BERLIN, Jan. 28.â Charles M. Schwab
president of the United States Steel Cor
poration, In his tour of the European
continent arrived here Thursday, and ha a
had . two busy days seeing acquaintances
and receiving a procession of bankers who
wanted to see the man who la directing Â£
billion dollars of capital.
Helse has forwarded to Germany an ac
count of his cousin's death In order that
the children of Hermann may be enabled
to secure the entire estate- at as early a
date as possible.
While I have no means of knowing: as yet
the value of the estate left by Mrs; Albers
meyer, it was considerable. -The letters came
Just as I was about to go to the funeral. Had
Albert' been advised sooner of the death of his
mother, he would probably be In Germany to
day. His mother and my mother were sla
ters. All that is now left of the family are
the two children of Hermann Albersmeyer,
who will now inherit the entire estate, as there
are no blood relatives near enough of kin to
entitle them, under the German law, to a
share of the estate. .
On Thursday morning two letters came
from Bremen. One was from the dead
man's uncle, announcing the death' of
Mrs. Albersmeyer on January 6 and tell
ing him to hurry home in order to claim
his portion of her estate, which was said
to be of considerable value. The other was
the formal notice of death. sent by the
authorities. Both letters were addressed
to Albersmeyer, in care of J. D. Heise,
who opened them. Heise said:
Albert came to this city some years
ago and was employed in various capaci
ties In grocery stores. His last employ
ment was with his cousin, Helse. No
news of his mother's serious illness had
reached him, although It was known that
she was ailing, her age making her- re
covery a matter of uncertainty.-
For years the senior Albersmeyer was an
employe of the German Government In
the railway service and occupied a high
position. He was frugal and accumulated
a considerable fortune. Old age caused
him to retire, and his eldest son, who was
engaged in business in Bremen, sold out
and accepted a position In the same serv
ice. He rilled the place for a number of
years and was being rapidly promoted.
About a year ago he died of pneumonia,
leaving a boy aged nine and a girl aged
seven years. The father died about two
months aso.
While the last rites were being per
formed over the body of Albert Albers
meyer, the man who lost his life at the
corner of Julian avenue and Sixteenth
street by falling from an awning on 'the
morning on which Police Officer Robin
son was shot down by footpads on Valen
cia and Sixteenth streets, a few feet
away, news came from Germany that
Albersmeyer's aged mother had died in
Bremen on January 6 last, the letter urg
ing him to hurry home and enjoy his
share of the comfortable estate left by
her. The news ,was received by the dead
man's cousin, J. D. Heise, a grocer at
Sixteenth and Valencia streets, for whom
Albersmeyer had worked.
On the morning of the Robinson mur
der Albersmeyer was awakened by the
shots fired by Officer Taylor under the
awning overlooked by Albersmeyer's win
dow. He crawled on the awning,
slipped, and, though - he endeavored to
catch the gutterway, was unable to hold
on. He fell to the sidewalk and died
shortly afterward.
Captain Sandal's condition is due to
worrying over the ship he formerly com
manded. â¢-Â¦ He brought the vessel down
from the Sound and on his arrival the
agents notified him that the vessel had
been chartered to take a cargo of mules
to the Fiji Islands. He did not find fault
with his cargo,* but did when thtey tried
to convert his ship into a mule barn by
erecting two stories on the main deck.
The captain thought the vessel would be
topheavy and would. turn turtle before It
had traveled twenty miles on its journey.
Experts were called in and gave different
opinions'. Captain Sandal then handed In
his resignation, which was accepted and
Captain. Smith was appointed to fill the
vacancy.
The sea captain was on the point of
returning to England when he became
temporarily Insane. He brought on his
condition . by constantly worrying over
the mule ship. He was taken to St.

Lynch went to Dawson some years ago,
taking with, him money to invest. It is
common gossip here and in the Northwest
Territory that he invested }t prudently
and derived large profits from the work
ings of one particularly good mine. But
the writing of books, while not so remun
erative as the delving for golden treasure
in the gulches of the Klondike, affords
Lynch far more pleasure than he derives
from gold digging. Hence he devotes his
leisure hours to book writing. ' '"

volume Â¦ will .. probably be published In

The people are of the opinion that some of
the School Directors desired very much to ad
vance the salaries of the favorite principals.
Thla^they could only do by creating some
twelve, sixteen and twenty class schools. I And
this probably was the motive of the scheme
which was to be carried out, even though the
primary pupils, their parents and large sections
of the city "were to be greatly inconvenienced
and made to suffer, for lack of . convenient
school accommodations, and the neighborhood
endangered by Immensely large, high and un
pl?htiy frame school buildings. The people
think that the School Directors showed In this
affair their incorapetency very palpably.
â¢What the people do want are more school
houses of modern construction and conveniently
located for the pupils they are to serve;- and
they do not want the" school fund squandered
on senseless, undesirable additions to out-of
date frame structures â Just for the sake of
creating high-salaried princlpalsblps at thÂ« dis
posal of the School Directors.
Some of the members of the local lodge
think it would be cheaper to drive the
herd of elks from Bakersfleld to the Yo
semlte, and volunteers from the . lodge
may be called for to act as vaqueros.
brought, they nevertheless proceeded with the
objectionable additions and had plans made for
fourth-story additions to these already too high
buildings, when legal steps were taken against
them and the Board or Public T.'orks. as also
against the builder to whom the contract for
the Dudley Stone school had been let.' All of
them were enjoined.
Brother Charles H. Jackson of San
Francisco Lodge has made a generous
offer to No. 3. He stated yesterday that
'should the members of the lodge of this
city be anxious to secure the herd' ho
would be glad to turn the animals out at
the Napa Springs and appoint a man to
look after them.
The question was brought up before San
Francisco Lodge No. 3 last Friday. A
committee was appointed to look into the
matter and report, and it is believed that
the iodge by itself will accept Miller &
Lux's generous offer. The cattle firm
thinks the herd should be preserved in a
public park in memory of the olden days
of the Golden State
Down near Bakersneld there Is a herd
of 500 four-footed elks that is owned by
Miller & Lux. The cattle firm has. of
fered to present to the Elk lodges of Cal
ifornia this last remnant of the Golden
State's once teeming moose population
under certain conditions. These are that
the lodges pay for transporting the noble
quadrupeds from the alfalfa field3 of the
oil region, where they hold their present
social sessions, to the Yosemlte Valley
reservation and employ a keeper for them
for at least one year. The cattle firm's
representatives say that the members of
the antlered herd are now mere pets and
that they will need a guardian until, un
der the influence of their proposed pri
mordial surroundings, they relapse Into a
wird state. The cattlemen say it will
take fully a year for the beasts to be
come auite savage againâ that is, so they
will.be gay enough at least not to poke
off to bed among the pine trees earlier
than 11 o'clock and rugged enough not to
have to go down to the soda springs the
first thing when they wake up.
The Elk lodges of California are on the
verge of embarking- in the livestock busi
ness, real quadruped elks to form their
herd. They have been made an offer by
the cattle firm of Miller & Lux, which.
If accepted, will make them at least the
temporary custodians of quite a large
family of antlered pets. Should the
ledges decide to accept the cattle firm's
offer they will call upon Uncle Sam to
furnish them free pasturage In the Yo
semtte Valley.
It was further illustrated to them that the
expense of the purchase of said lot and a mod
ern school building erected thereon would prob
ably not exceed much, if anything, the cost
of making the contemplated additions to the
Dudley Stone and the Fremont Primary school
buildings, as outlined by the School Directors,
whf-reas the contemplated additions were ob
jectionable to the residents and property own
ers and in flagrant violation of the building
ordinances of tills c'.ty and county.
But In spit*' of all the pleadings, petitions,
ereuments and protests, and In spjje of being
warned that injunction proceedings would he

It wae further pointed out to the School
Directors that a lot of 150 feet frontage by
437 :Â« feet in depth could be purchased for
about $7500 in the vicinity of Cole and Freder
ick streets in the very center of the present
as well as future population of the districts,
where the Pacific Improvement Company was

tioned.
Since 1897 the people of the Ashbury Heights
and Panhandle districts have been petitioning
for better and more convenient school accom
modations than that afforded by the Dudley
Stone. Fremont and Jackson primary school
buildlnge, the latter of wblch is a. small, un
fcanitary makeshift affair, rented from private
parties and eltuatefi on Stanyan street, near
Pace During the last two years the needs
for school accommodations of the districts have
become more pressing than ever, and time and
again the requirements of the districts have
beea officially brought to the notice or thÂ«
tchool Directors.
It wu ehown to them that in the entire ter
ritory from Masonic avenue on the east to
Seventh avenue on the west, and from Mc-
Aillster street on the north to Clarendon ave
nue and Seventeenth street on the south, more
than two square miles In extent, the munici
pality did not own a single school building,
nor any land available for such.
It was Illustrated to the Bchool Directors
that the Dudley Stone and Fremont Primary
school buildings, situated respectively in the
extreme easterly and northeasterly portions cf
the districts, were too far distant to accommo
date the children conveniently, that more than
2Â»0 of them were compelled to carry their din
ners to school, that any additions to said school
buildings as they contemplated making were
not desired by the people of the districts, that
the prudÂ«it course to pursue would be to pur
chase Â» centrally located 6chool lot and erect
a modern eight or twelve class school building
thereon, and not fritter away thousands of
dollars on objectionable additions to old build
ings not conveniently located for the school
population.
Mayor Schmitz yesterday stopped pay
ment on the demand for $3250 drawn by
the Board of Education to pay for a lot
adjoining the Fremont School on McAllis
ter street, between Broderick and Baker.
The holding up of the demand is prelim
inary to an investigation which will be
commenced against Directors Mark and
Denxnan to ascertain why the sum named
was agreed to be paid when three differ
ent lots, in the same block have been of
fered for $22)0 and another* for $2000.
C D Saltleld, president of the Ashbury
Heights end Panhandle Districts Im
provement Club, submitted figures from
several real estate agents to show that
the price charged for the lot purchased
by the board is exorbitant. Mark and
Denman. in replying to the charge that
the Fremont School addition novr being
built is costly, have, in a communication
to the Mayor, thrown the blame on'Sal
fleld for bringing injunction proceedings
to restrain the last board from building
an additional etory on the Dudley Stone
building in defiance of the building ordi
nance. Because they were enjoined in
that case, the Bchool Directors, according
to Mark and Denman, decided to exca
vate under the Fremont School Instead of
adding a story on the top of the build
ing. Salfield yesterday filed a lengthy
communication with the Mayor giving a
history of the controversy between the
people of the Ashbury Heights district
and the Board of Education. *

WOMEN AND THE WEATHER.
ITS EFFECT ON THEM.
By MARGARET L. BRIGGS.
CALL RIGHTS RESERVED.)
It is a fact that most women are depressed in cloudy weather. A well-
known woman writer says It Is because women do not' choose their clothes
properly; that women should wear bright colors on a cloudy day, some-
thing to give cheer to the sombre surroundings. But that this is a mis-
taken Idea Is quickly shown by a careful study of the physical condition of
the body.
For If you go into the matter carefully, you will find that all women are
not depressed and gloomy in cloudy weatherâ it is only a certain class of
women; and following: it up you will come to the conclusion that women
who suffer from some, female disorder are subject to this despondency
from rainy weather. In other words, the really strong, healthy women ar-j
not affected by weather; and if a woman is affected by weather, It is a sure
indication that she is sick.
Those women who have some inflammation of the generative organs
are most subject to this despondency. It attacks them particularly In the
spring time, and causes the sufferer to become too tired and languid to at-
tend to her duties, almost.
The number of women affected In this way Is amazing. There is no
doubt that half of the women of our country have some disorder of the
feminine organs. Inflammation sets in and attracts to the diseased organs
much of the vitality of the body, leaving the sufferer weakened and nerv-
ous. This may cause her little painâ she may th!nk the pain she suffer
natural to all women â but the nervousness and lack of strength almost in :
variably indicate the presence of feminine troubles. To add to the dis-
comfort, on cloudy daVs the vitality is still further lowered by the condi-
tion of the air we breathe, ar.d the woman is depressed, often to the verse
of feeling that life is unbearable.
There is. too, another kind of ailing woman, the woman who always
has a cold. She gets it every time the weather changes; she gets it when
her house is not evenly heated, as she passes from one room to another.
She gets it unless she is bundled up just so whenever she goes out, she
gets it from draughts in the house.
Here again you will find that the healthy woman is not troubled. It
is the woman whose vitality is low, whose physical condition is not strong
enough to throw off the effects of atmospheric changes. It is the woman
Â¦who is nervous and anaemic, or it is the young girl just starting out in
her womanhood, who Is pale and thin and listless.
There Is no reason why any woman should be continually depressed,
. or have a cold two-thirds of the time. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound will overcome these troubles. Susceptibility to cold and de-
spondency is due to imperfect circulation of the blood. Mrs. Pinkham's
medicine acts directly on the nerve centers of the female organism which
controls the blood circulation. When a woman's organism is In a perfectly
normal and healthy state she is Insured against half the ordinary ills which
make women so miserable â things which apparently have no relation to
female troubles at all, and yet are due to the condition which uterine
troubles impose upon the system. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound will build up the physical condition of the woman who takes It. be-
cause It will cure those female disorders that cause her to become so de-
spondent. The inflammation that :s so troublesome will soon dlsap-
; pear.
Mrs. Pinkham has spent many years in studying these matters, and
knows well what the female organism needs. Every woman, therefore,
may feel certain that health Is hers, if she will but avail herself of the sym-
pathy and advice so freely offered, and do as Mrs. Pinkham suggests.
Address her at Lynn, Mass. Mrs. Pinkham's medicine has been taken by
thousands of women who were nervous and depressed, and the cures re-
ported are marvelous in their success.
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound will make every despondent
woman strong and healthy, so that her system will immediately throw off
any of the bad effects of weather and toil. Let every woman who Is de-
spondent, every woman who is nervous or in pain from any disorder of the
feminine organism, try this medicine that has done and is doing so much
fcr women.

interesting discussion of matters relating
to the order and the new officers gave evi
dence of a desire to make a record such as

expects that every member of it will "be
doin sumthin 1 " for the order and the

from the roll and the' councils asked to
appoint some one who will attend. It was
decided to offer prizes to those members

appointed the committee on the extension
of the order and they were given power
to arrange for the offering of the prizes
and to invite the councils of Alameda
County to visit the cabinet during its ses
sion. There were addresses by a number
of members, who offered valuable sugges
tions for the advancement of the order,
and the large number of delegates present
promised to do all in their power to assist
the new officers. It was shown by the re
ports that the cabinet i3 in a healthy con
ditiori and that during the year ending
1901 Yosemite Council had gained 18 mem
bers, California 29, San Francisco 5, Pa
cific 34, Golden Gate 6, El Dorado 47 and
El Capitan 35, making the membership in
this city on that date 1780.

TO KILL THE DANDRUFF GEBM
Is the Only Possible Way of Having
a Permanent Cure>
If you sec a woman or a man with lux-
uriant glossy hair you may be sure
neither has dandruff to amount to any-
thing. In nearly every case where women
and men have thin, brittle hair they owe
it to dandruff. There are hundreds of
preparations that "claim" to cure dan-
druff, but no one but Newbro'o Herpicide
tells you that dandruff is the result of a
germ burrowing into. the scalp, and that
permanent cure of dandruff and its con-
sequent falling and baldness can only be
had, by killing: the germ; and there is no
other, preparation that will destroy that
germ but Newbro's Herpiclde. "Destroy
the cause, you remove the effect."

crease. $2,736,150. Surplus, $25,332,400; in
crease. $6,720,950.
The Financier says: ' The bank returns this
week showed a gain of $0,007,100 in cash, mak
ing an increase in this item, compared with
the cash at the end of last year, of $27,140,300.
It is noteworthy that the total Increase in cash,
as estimated from the traceable movement of
money into the banks for the four weeks end
ing last week was $33,865,200, indicating that
the bank return and the unofficial estimate of
cash movement now very nearly agree, there
being a discrepancy of only $6,724,900. As was
the case in the previous week the gain in cash
ehovtn by the banks was almost wholly con
fined to specie, the Increase in legal tenders
being only $281,200. The loans showed the re
markably smal lgaln of $2,413,500. This, fol
lowing an increase of but $3,292,300 in the pre
vious week, would seem to indicate ' an un
usually limited amount of borrowing from
banks for the reason probably due in a great
part to the light speculation on the Stock Ex
change. The money loan at call during the
week most likely consisted principally of com
mission-house balances. Loans by interior
banks of deposits at their New York corre
spondents and those by bankers who had bor
rowed on sterling would not be reflected In the
loan item of the New .York banks. Deposits
showed an Increase of $10,944,000, or only
$476,000 'below the total of the gain in loans
and in cash; hence, the statement in this re
spect is harmonious. The surplus reserve
showed an increase of $6,270,950, and this iteni
now stands at $25,332,400, or within $5,467,050
of the amount recorded in the correspond lnjt
week last year. The Increase in surplus since
the beginning of 1002 has been S17.816.R25,
which may be regarded as a very encouraging
Improvement In bank conditions, giving assur
ance of somewhat prolonged ease in money.
It ia noteworthy, however, that while the
cash increase of all thÂ» banks was $9,007,100,
one bank alone reported an addition of $5,570,
100 to its specie account and $8,864,500 to de
posits,'thus destroying in part the significance
of the statement, considered as a whole.

Mall advices from New Tcrk cay
"The general tone of the market throughout
the list Is strong, but for most descriptions
the movement continues somewhat jobbing In
character. At the moment currants form the
cblef interest, with inquiries here from interior
points for conElderable lots, sellers declining
to meet Intending buyers' views and showing
Indifference to part with any quantity below
the epot basis.
"In raisins epot Is quiet for both loose and
eeeded. K. o. b. prices made yesterday by one
holder on the basis of 5%c for 2-crown, 6c for
3-crown and 6%c for 4-crown are attracting
little attention. In seeded epot Is showing
Eome quietness, with prices ranging from Sc
to 8%c on cartons covering choice and fancy.
A report is current that considerable purchases
were made to-day on the basis of 8%c for
fency. Pending the naming of prices on seeded
by the syndicate on the Coast there is little
disposition shown to tell in a large way on
speculative purchases. Imported Valencia
layer raisins are held firmly at 7%c, with
stocks reported generally light. Late advices
from the other side note limited offerings from
the primary market on any basis.
"In prunes the situation is quiet, little Im
portant trading being noted. On Jobbing ac
count there is a email movement within the
quoted range for best offerings. Apricots are
steady, with, it is reported, a little more in
quiry noted. Peaches also show firmness. In
dates Persian dates are Eteady and showing
some firmness among the principal holders on
the quoted basis. Fard dates are easier and
quoted lie lower on both boxes and cases.
Figs are in demand, with some interest in both
bags and layers within the quoted range."

NEW YORK. Jan. 25.â The weakness of
to-day's etock market v.as about as narrow as
the recent show of strength and seemed equally
due to profes-siona.1 operations by operators
who took their pronts in specialties that have
advanced recently. Sugar. Metropolitan and
Amalgamated Copper were all thus affected,
the last showing good power of absorption.
New Tork Central was depressed by the Coro
ner's verdict holding Its officials responsible
for the tunnel disaster. There was a sharp
rise In National Lead on the announced ad
vance In the price of lead. The gain In cash
shown by the bank statement was fully up
to expectations. The fact that Interior instl- I
tutlons have been placing loans In New York
Â¦leads to the Idea that a corresponding reduc
tion In deposits would result to the New York
banks, but the statement failed to show this.
On the contrary loans of the local banks have
expanded $2,413,500. The influence of this
ehowlng is emphasized by the compilation of
the annual showing of the New York trust
companies. The loans on collateral by these
Institutions on December 31 were $540,208,706.

have been subscribed for many times over.
The Bank of France also shows a strong condi
tion in Paris and little inducement to call the
home capital to that center. This condition
has a direct bearing on the New York money
market and promises opportunity for renewal
of the foreign obligations of this market
which are known to be heavy, and which it
was feared would have to be met by gold ex
ports. The accumulation of idle capital in
Berlin was a condition sure to result from the
prolonged liquidation and depression In Ger
many, and the movement to reinvest it may be
regarded as a sign that the turning point .of
the long depression has been reached there. No
sign has been seen, however, that German
capital is seeking any Investment In the New
lork securities market. In London also, the
easier money conditions and the hopes of an
early termination of the Boer war have led
to a lively revival of the "Kaffir circus," but
London has shown no disposition to embark in
New \ork stocks. In fact London has been a
steady but moderate seller of stocks in Lon
don all the week. The recuperation of the
condition of New York banks has continued to
a liberal extent and interest rates have be
come easier In consequence, but without stim
ulating stock speculation.
' Chicago closed the week lower, but there waa
some good buying on the breaks. Outsiders
liquidated considerably and the only/iupport
was from packers.
There wa3 no change in this market. lhÂ«

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Jan. 25.â Wheat started fairly
steady, mainly on j the sharp . rally at Liver
pool, which was quoted %& higher. Light
domestic receipts coupled with the closing
firmness of yesterday, induced considerable
buying, - under which May opened unchanged
to " %c higher at 79%@79%c to 79%c.
There was not enough buying, however,
to carry \ the market up . to any great
extent and after ' May touched 79 %c re
ports . of a generous snowfall throughout the
Southwest, where the winter wheat . has been
threatened with damage, developed a decidedly
bear sentiment and the slight advance wai
soon lost. A rumor that the advance at Liver
pool was due to the fact that . a 3c duty was
likely to be imposed on the other side, coupled
with a decided . slump in the price of corn,
started a selling movement that forced the
price of May down to 78c. The execution of
stoplos8 orders also helped the decline. There
was a little demand during the break except
from shorts when bought sparingly* to secure
profits. The market closed weak within He
of the bottom price of the day at 78 Vic for
May. Small Western offerings and an advance
of %d at Liverpool gave corn a strong start,
but trade was slow and the market soon
showed a tendency to sag off. â¢ As prices
worked lower liquidation became general and
the market broke badly. There was a feeble
â¢attempt made to rally the market toward the
close, but liquidation was too heavy. The
close was weak. May closed at Ol'ic
Oats were Influenced by the weakness in the
other grains. . â¢
Trade was mainly in July. May closed
about a cent lower at 44c. â¢ â¢
Provisions were dull but comparatively
steady. May pork closed 10c lower,,at $16 37%;
May lard practically unchanged :at $9 50 and
May 'ribs, 2%c lower at $8 55.

Remarkable man tnat ever
came to this city.
HIS CALLERS SAY SO,
And who should know better than those who
have readings with -him?
IF YOU HAVE NOT
Been satisfied with what you gained from
other mediums you muet not condemn this
gentleman before you try him. He has a
world wide reputation as being the most suc-
cessful clairvoyant in this country. If YOU
have never heard of him, write your frlentis
in other cities In regard to his work, and
your doubts will Immediately be removed
and you will lose no time In visiting him.
YOU SHOULD NOT
Miss letting him read for you, for his power
as a PSYCHIC far surpasses anything you
ever saw. His predictions can be implicitly
relied upon.
HE IS BUSY
All the time. People from out of town com-
ing to see PROF. BROCKWAY would not
have to wait so long if they will write be-
forehand, naming an hour as an engage-
ment.
You say, are the people pleased? They arc
simply : astounded, amazed. They say they
naver saw anything like it.
Spiritualists, scientists, merchants, bank-
ers and people of highest class of society
have , had readings with him and pronounce
him unequaled In his profession.
Their enthusiastic expressions
are:
"Isn't he marvelous?" -
"He Is the best I ever saw."
"He tells so-true. He actually told my
name. He told me my life better than I
could myself."
PSYCHIC-MAGNETISM,
OR
SOUL FORCE,
Has been tested and proven beyond a doubt
to be one of the most remarkable and mys-
terious of nature's gifts to mankind. It is
only of late years that a small number of
psychics of this country have developed this
great force to any degree of usefulness,
PROF. BROCKWAY being one of that few
who by giving himself up to the very strin-
gent laws "of nature for the past fifteen
years HAS ATTAINED TO A VERY
MARKED DEGREE an efficiency in the use
of this great and mysterious ferce. He uses
his power and knowledge for the happiness
and good of -mankind.
Some people .wonder why they are not
successful when others about them, although
of less seeming ability than themselves, are
prosperous in all they attempt. Some ladie.3
attract the attention of the opposite sex like
a natural magnet ;. others, although none the
less brilliant and good looking, are neglected,
and they wonder why their friends have such
hosts of admirers and they have none. Gen-
tlemen have the same experience to tell.
Why is it? . Why do others get rich while you
remain poor? Why do others succeed in all
they undertake while you always fall? Why
do your friends attract suitable companions,
marry and have happy homes, and not you?
IT IS BECAUSE you have not enough of
this great force called magnetism. Call on
PROF. BROCKWAY. He will impart to
.you the knowledge and tell you how you may
become successful In all you undertake, HOW
TO OVERCOME YOUR ENEMIES. How to
obtain your HEART'S DESIRE, how to
bring others to your way of thinking,
BY THIS REMARKABLE POWER. '

WASHINGTON MINES ARE GOOD M1NBB.
WASHINGTON MINES ARE GOOD MINES.
WASHINGTON MINE6 ARE GOOD MINES.
Washington mines will make more money
for shareholders than any others in the West
because of: Â¦ Â¦ .
Pact 1 â The ores carry high values la Cop-
per, Gold aud Silver.
Fact 2 â The presence on the. properties of all
the auxiliaries to successful mining
â timber, water, coal, coke and lime.
Fact 3 â Power for running machinery costs
nothing.. Within a year it is said
electric railroads will be operated
In the Carbon River district by water
power.
Fact 4 â Proximity to the seaboard (Copper
King mines are only 45 miles from
the sea at Tacoma) means low
freight expense and correspondingly
larger profit e, in addition to the
markete of the world being open to
the mine owner after ' his stuff is
aboard ship.
Fact 5â More money Is being expended on
Washington mines than on others,
and therefore greater accomplish-
* ments are possible. Mining and
allied industries are making tre-
mendous strides in AVashlngton.
Puget Sound beckons to capital, and
Â¦â¢ capital readily responds. Success is
sure to attend a company with good
properties, well managed.'
THE COPPER . KING MINING SYNDICATE
THE COPPER KING MINING SYNDICATE
THE COPPER KING MINING SYNDICATE
Has a magnificent group of C5 claims in the
Carbon River district.. Just north of Mount
Rainier, in which district mine values have
more than doubled during the past year. The
silver content of the ore will alone pay for
working, leaving as a pront the value of the
gold and copper, ranging from $12 to $18 per
ton, and, In some instances, $30 and over per
ton.

Tiie values known to exist In the ores of the
various mines of the Carbon River district
lead the various companies to plan a big
smelter at Montezuma, the new town where
big coal mines are Just opened and coking
ovens . Installed. The central location of the
proposed smelter will make it easy of access
and will enable the mines to handle their ores
at small expense.

THEMES OF THE* PASTORS
IN SOME OF CITY'S CHTTRCHES
On the evening of the 20th Inst. the fol
lowing named were installed as the offi
cers of Myrtle Lodge of the A. O. U. W.
for the current term by W. C. Growley,
D. D. G. M. W.j and a full corps of acting
grand officers: Dr. E. E. Balrd, P. M.W.;
S. W. Chadbourne, M. W.; F. H. Thrall,
F.;C. M. Bouton, O.; G. E. Burnham.
G.; A. F. Goetjen, I. W.; R. Young. O.
W. After the installation the members
went to a Market-street cafe, where there
was served a supper and there were re
sponses to toasts by Grand Recorder
Spencer, District Deputies Crowley, Law
ton and Thompson. Past Master Balrd
and the new master workman. The re
ports presented show that the lodge is In
better condition than It has been for
ye,ars, having 12000 In bank. During the
past year the averagu age of members
was reduced by fifteen months by reason
of the taking of a number of young mem
bers. The average of the membership at
this time Is under 36 years.
Pacific Lodge of Oakland had a hard
tack party last -week. It was well at
tended and there was a good programme
of entertainment.
Grand Recorder Spencer will pay a visit
to Sausalito Lodge on the 29th Inst. for
the purpose of installing the officers. He
will be accompanied by several members
of the San Francisco extension commit
tee.
Grand Master Morrison reports that all
the lodges ! in the southern part of the
State are doing well, frequently adding to
the membership by initiation.
Special Deputy Calvert started out In
behalf of the lodge in Meridan recently
and in a week secured twenty-one mem
bers.
The San Francisco extension committee
has now been placed in the charge of Past
Grand Master Edwin Danforth by Deputy
Grand Master Barnes, who declared that
press of other engagements In connection
with the work of the order prevents him
from giving that branch the attention It
deserves. At the meeting held on the 18th
inst. Mr. Danforth outlined a plan of
operations and it was decided to perfect
it at the next meeting.
Ex-Grand Recorder Poland was in this
city last week visiting friends. He will
shortly leave for Pony, Mont., to take up
his residence there with his son.
The deputy grand master visited the
lodge in Haywards last week and took
part In the memorial service held by that
subordinate. The following night that offi
cer, in company with Grand Receiver
Booth, visited the lodge at Tesla and In
stalled the officers. ...
AH arrangements have been concluded
for the entertainment to be given under
the auspices of the Grand Lodge in Odd
Fellows' Hall on the night of the 29th inst.

man beer garden, and the refreshments
Â¦ were doled out with a lavish hand. Not

I was rendered. -The features of the even-
Ing were serious and humorous papers by
, D. M. Delmas and Judge John Hunt Del
: mas discussed the serious side of Bohemia
â¢ and Judge Hunt Its funny side. Both pa
i pers were highly appreciated.
E. Johnson played "Yankee Doodle" so
many ways on the piano that it made the
audience dizzy trying to follow the mel
i ody. W. J. O'Brien sang a number of
1 songs, Harry Nieman gave a number of
! clever specialties, Gus Hartman told the
: funny experiences he had at amateur
! prixe-fights, William Heazleton sang
' comic songs, Charles Kounan played the
piano, Harry Cashman told Hebrew
stories, Al Cercle rendered ragtime solos,
| G. Yates sang and Louis Loeb improvised
, on the piano.
The following committee was In charge

300 guests and members participated in
the merrymaking. The hall presented a
novel appearance. Two score tables laden
with bottles of beer, pipes, tobacco and
sandwiches filled the room. Through the
cloud Â«of smoke the platform was. barely
discernable. T. J. Crowley, master of the
revel, sat In a blgh-backed chair and gave
his. orders in a manner that brooked no
Interference. Ike Tuchler, "officer of the

"Senor Macaroni," Impersonated by a
member of the club, gave an exhibition
of wireless telegraphy pictures,* showing
in amusing cartoons a number of public

per never has been issued in Washington.
xt was profusely illustrated and contained
many pertinent and impertinent allusions
to guests and public affairs. One of the
best features was a "country school," in
which a Gridiron class gave an exhibition

It is of more than passing interest to
note that the Denver papers say that the
cyanide process is being discarded In Col
orado as a primary ore treatment : in the
leading gold district of the State. The
Denver News reports 'that where tho
process is used it is confined to the ex
traction of values from tailings, and even
in this limited field It plays a subordinate
role. The Â¦> News says: : :"'
This Is' a rapid 'descent Bince 1894. when the

Since 1843 the annual product of gold has in
creased 654 per cent; silver. BOO per cent. The
price of gold has remained unchanged since
1725, while that of sliver has declined 54 per
cent Â»ince 1859. The amount of gold in ex
istence at the present time is estimated to be
$10,913,000,000 -and of silver $6,071,000,000,
making a total of the precious metals In ex
istence of $16,984,000,000, . an i increase since
1848 of $9,684,000,000. The annual product of
the preclou* metals has increased < from $94.
000,000 in 1848 to $454,000,000 in 1900. Â¦ The
annual -product of Â¦ gold has "increased from
2,782,237 ounces in 1848 to 17,932,437 in 1900.
The annual product of silver has Increased
during the same period from 31,000,000 ounces
to 186,000.000. Sliver has declined from $1 36
per ounce in 1859 to- 63 cents at the present
time. Its ratio to gold is thirty to one,, with
an increasing tendency.
The Review traces the progress of the
gold - output of i the world in the period
since 1843 .as follows:
1849, $10,151,360: 1850, $41,273,106: 1851;
$75,938,232: 1853, $67,613,487; 1854, $69,433,931;
1S55, $55,485,395.
The greatest year for gpld output, in
cluded In the table was, according to the
figures of Statistician Charles G. Yale,
1852, which produced a total of $81,294,700.
Here are Mr. Yale's conclusions concern
ing the output for a series of years in
the' early days In Californlai ,
Estimate of J. D. Whitney, $62,500,000: J.

A special number of the Mining and
Engineering Review contains a review of
the mineral Industry of .California. The
number, is filled , with Information of
value and is handsomely Illustrated. A
table of statistics reviews the total pro
duction of gold, in California ! since 1848
according to different authorities. This
is extremely interesting because it shows
how at variance may be the views of
competent observers on the very inter
esting question of the actual gold pro
duction. Taking the year 1853 " for an ex
ample, these varying estimates are af
forded. The estimate follows:

The Etna Advance says that - the . Hid
den Treasure mine . on Boulder i Creek,
Slsklyou County, has been bonded by
John Russell, the owner, to, H. Â£Â». Mc-
Allister of Etna, who will begin to sink
on tbe ledge. The ore . Is base and must
be smelted. '
- A , new ledge is reported to have been
struck at the Cherry Hill quartz mine at
Cherry Creek, Slsklyou . County, by the
running of a tunnel at a depth of 500 feet.
The Placervllle Nugget reports that
work is proceeding at the Levitt mine in
Darl Canyon, two miles from Kelsey, El
Dorado County, under the direction of F.
Levitt of Los Angeles.
There are many people in Keswick who
laugh at the present situation as only a calm.
Tbe great .works are too .vast to be . allowed
to stay long idle, even in part. Keswick will
be a good smelter town fifty years from now.
Even Anaconda, Butte and Jerome have had
their calms for a ' month Â¦ or so recently." but
in, each of them the. old activity has now re
turned. Keswick and Blsbee are now In an
eclipse that must be only temporary.
'The only thing that looks really blue about
the situation Is that no ore is coming down
from- tho mine. * The 'Mountain Copper Com
pany seems to know its own* business, 'and
knows also how to keep it to Itself. It asks
advice from no- one. pays It* own -bills and
doesn't take the public into its confidence.
Â¦ Three of the- four furnaces are kept running
and the new one has a fire in It The con
verters that have Just been completed at the
expense of thousands of - dollars are ' ready to
start. The matte roasters have been fired.
The stock of calcine is sufficient to keep all
the furnaces running for months.
According to the Redding Free Press,
no more ore is coming from the mine of
the Mountain Copper Company, at Iron
Mountain. The force of men has been
cut down and 100 men were dismissed in
one week. Only one train crew has been
running up on the mountain Â¦ to the mine
in place of four when the mine was in
full blast. Six of the eleven MacDougalls
have been chut down. At the smelter, so
says the Free Press, there is evidence of
prosperity.
The Calaveras Citizen says that the
Beatrice Company Is preparing to ! work
on several properties | west of Angels
Camp. Much assessment work is being
done In that district. â¢ The ' Tenderfoot
group of quartz claims is being prospect-^
ed, as are also the New Deal, Hidden
Treasure and Pauper's Dream properties,
all - of which are free gold propositions.
There is a revival of gravel mining at
Douglas Flat.
The shaft of the Argonaut mine, in
Amador County, has reached a depth of
2020 feet and sinking still continues, so
says the Amador Ledger. The opening up
of the Peerless property, on the north of
the Kirkwood mine, is reported to depend
upon the developments in the Kirkwood.
The Amador-Phoenix mine will cross-cut
for the ledge, at a depth of about 715 feet.
According to the Yreka Journal, a New
Jersey trust company has taken- a mort
gage of $100,000 on | mining claims along
Klamath River, below Happy Camp.
Numerous locations of mining claims have
been made in Slsklyou : County since the
beginning of the year. The cold weather
has again stopped mining to a great ex
tent by freezing .up the little creeks and
ditches. Lively. times are anticipated dur
ing the coming summer on the forks of
the Humbug on quartz ledges. According
to the Du'nsmuir News," the Tyrer Min
ing Company has started up a new stamp
mill with ten stamps. " . : â¢ ' â¢
Preparing to Run.
When the mill at the Shawmut mine, in
Toulumne County, is completed 200 stamps
will be at. work. A large force is work
ing to install the mill. The Jumper, and
App mines are running on full-time, with
forty stamps pounding day and night.
The Star mine, which has been Â¦ shut
down for some time, . will be started up
again. A bond on the Wheal-Perrin mine,
at Soulsbyvllle, has been taken by Hal.
J. Sisty. The shaft on the' Proudhommo
mine will be < sunk deeper. There is a
prospect that the California and New Era
mines, on the south side of the Toulumne
River, will be developed.
Once more the miners have taken heart
on account of. the recent' rains, with
which came some snow in the mountains.
But there . is still less snow .than the
miners would like' to see. , The scarcity
of water is indicated ; by a record kept at
Angels Camp, Calaveras County, where
only 1L33 Inches of rain fell during the
season up- to January 17, as against a
total of 20.33 inches for the corresponding
season of 1901. While the claims are be
ing worked generally on the mother lode,
a short season is threatened.
"They would be glad to come in as a
State or a Territory or under the military
authorityâ almost any way in order to
come under the authority of the United
States."
Continuing on this topic Colonel Bliss
said he thought commercial union with
Cuba would postpone political union. | Per
sonally he was not convinced of the wis
dom of annexation. The feeling in Cuba
was one of readiness to accept any con
ditions thelUnited States might impose.
Asked whether there was much poverty
and distress among the Cubans Colonel
Bliss said there was not. But the con
dition was like that of a bank about to
break and the people did not know what
would become of them three months
hence. â¢' ' i. . ' . ,
Lewis Place, head of the Cuban dele
gation made a statement controverting
the claim that the reciprocity movement
was instigated by the United States sugar
interests and contending that the Cubans
bad -long urged and expected these con-
Mendoza. also of the Cuban delegation,
added the statement that the Platt
amendment had been accepted by Cuba
on assurances from the late President Mc-
Kinley that his Influence . woujd Â¦ be ex
erted with Congress to secure economic
concessions for the island. These as
surances were relied on. Mendoza said,
and without their execution the Platt
amendment would, bring, no advantage to
Cuba. The Cuban hearing then went over
until Tuesday, when the beet sugar men
and several Cubans will be heard. _
"I think a great majority of the Cubans
are ready to come in," Colonel . Bliss re
plied.
"As a Territory or a State?" asked
Newlands.
"Are the Cuban people prepared to come
into political relations with the United
States?" i :
In opening his statement he . said his
knowledge of the sugar business was con
fined to that of an observer 'in an official
position dealing with the trade of Cuba.
This had led him to hope that if there
was any change in tho tariff It would be
such an adjustment as would thrcV into
the hands of the United States the. large
amount' of Cuban trade now taken by for
eign countries. Â¦â¢ . â¢ â¢
Speaking first of the condition of the
CuDan sugar industry he said it was
greatly depressed. He estimated the
sugar industry of the island at $200,000,000
and said about three-fourths of the peo
ple were dependent in one way or another
on the sugar industry.
â¢Chairman Payne asked Colonel Bliss to
specify - what advantages the United
States could gain from Cuba and Payne
also called attention to the low tariff rate
Cuba imposed against the United States.
Colonel Bliss said the average ad valorem
rate was about 21 per cent and he pre
sented tables designed to show how. a
tariff readjustment could throw practical
ly all of the Cuban trade into the hands
of American producers. He also sub-,
mitted a list of articles on which a dif
ferential of about 33 per cent, favorable
to the United States as -against other
foreign countries, would give us the trade.
Representative . Newlands of Nevada
suggested that without our political con
trol of Cuba there might be servile labor
to compete with American labor. He
added: â¢

A correspondent of the Los Angeles
Herald writes from Los Alamos that work
in the Carreaga field Is Interrupted be
cause of the lack of tankage sufficient
to accommodate the producing wells. Two
wells are overflowing and the oil Is going
to waste. Â¦Â¦. -
F. B. Henderson has been made the
agent of the' Associated Oil Company at
Bakersfield. He has begun the discharge
of his duties at that point.
The Monte Crlsto Oil Company has pur
chased a large amount of small pipe for
the purpose of using the gas that comes
from its wells. It is supposed that there
Is enough gas escaping to supply three
boilers. .
Eleven wells are being- drilled at Ful
lerton on the Santa Fe land and other
wells are also in progress. Development
Is going on constantly at Fullerton.
The project Â¦ is under discussion at
Bakersfleld of the organization of a clear
ing-house for the benefit of companies in
the Kern River district that continue out
side of the Associated Oil Company. C.
E. Young, secretary of the Oil Exchange,
is corresponding on that subject with tbe
owners of oil wella. - \ '
The Reed Crude Oil Company has announced
that on or b'fore February 10 a dividend oÂ£
2% per cent will be paid to stockholder*.
Since Joining the Associated Oil Company the
management of the Reed - Crude Company be
lieves It sees its pay to paying good dividends
for ' some time, and announces that as soon
as the bonds of tbe combine have been assigned
tho Reed Crude will pay' a dividend of prob
ably 7 per cent. This may be some time* In
May . or June next. " Â¦ ,* . ..'
The Bakersfleld Calif oralan says:
Colusa County, Chehalls Oil, Williams OH,
Bear Valley Oil, Herron Oil, Smith- & Gorrill,
Minor Oil. Hammond & Butters.
The first effect of the 'formation, of the
Associated Oil Company and Jits actual
opening for business is Just what the pro
motors of the enterprise hoped for. Prices
for .oil under contract have risen. One
contract nae been placed for 50,000 barrels
of oil at thirty-five cents per barrel. : This
is the best price obtained since last
spring. The companies In . the , combine
are pleased. The showing: Is an excellent
argument for the companies that are still
outside. Tha - party - taking g the oil -at
thirty-five cents per barrel- formerly had
a contract for fifteen cents per barrel
with - one of the companies Â¦ that has be
come a part of the greater organization.
j t According to the Los Angeles - Herald
the majority of the stock of the California
Standard and Giant Oil companies has
been placed -in -escrow pending the con
summation of a deal by > which the prop
erty will pass into the hands of the syn
dicate that ..has purchased .the Market
street Railway. The stock goes at titty
and sixty cents. <;
An electric line is proposed at Los An
geles to run from Sespe to the Devils Gate
in Ventura County, passing through the
Sespe Canyon. An application has been
made for a franchise. Power is procur
able from Sespe Creek, which has a fall
of ten feet. The road would furnish an
outlet for the territory of the several com
panies that have large land holdings in
Ventura County.
The best grade of fuel oil In the Lod
Angeles field is reported to be quoted at
forty to fifty cents per barrel at the wells.
Jewett & Blodgett may lay a pipe line to
accommodate owners of oil properties in
the northern part of the Sunset district.
There is also some talk that the railroad
line will be extended. One plan might sst
aside the other.

A Coroner's Jury returned a verdict of
death by accident yesterday in the. case
of Barry Baldwin Jr., who was asphyx
iated at his -home, 2945 Washington street
on January 15. The principal witnesses
were George Van Norden and John R.
Balrd.
Van Norden, who said he worked around
the racetrack, testified that on the even
ing previous to the day on which Bald
win's body was discovered he accompa
nied Mr. Baldwin home at his request,
the last named naving informed the wlt
x-ess that he expected some trouble. John
R. Balrd was on the doorstep, and Bald
win said to him, "You can't come in
here." Baird replied: "I want to go in;
it is not your house; it is my sister's
house." Then Baird and Baldwin clinch
ed and the witness ran up and separated
them. He requested both men to go into
the house, and- they did so. Baldwin was
not under the influence of liquor. AftT
the witness got home Baldwin telephoned
for him, but 'the witness' folks did not
know that he was borne and therefore did
not notify him.
"Many, many times," continued the wit
ness, "Mr. Baldwin said to me, 'Some day
I'll go by the gas route.' "
The witness and Barry had three or
four drinks together on the afternoon of
the 14th. closing their conviviality with a
pint bottle of champagne. ...
John; R. Balrd. brother-in-law of the
deceased, testified that on the evening of
the alleged altercation he, the witness
was notified by telephone that Mrs. Bald
win, his sister, and her husband wished

of Old Hoss Hoey danced with coy maid
ens from the village,' sedate ma'ams from
the way back parochial schools, austere
mistresses of the homesteads and pert,
saucy hoidens from the fields and the
orchards. It only needed the lowing cows
and the other inhabitants of the farm
yard to make the barn dance of last night
perfectly realistic. - .--:..,... ..
The employes of Lebenbaum & Co. have
had many entertainments, picnics and
dances, outing and socials, but the barn
