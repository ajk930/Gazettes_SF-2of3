"It's true." continued Miss Alma-Bes
â¢wickâfor that Is the name of the little
bossâ "I would vote for my party, or use
ray influence in its favor, because such
are my principles even if I were not in
politics, but if I could make the same
amount of money at Â¦ any other work, I
would never be a worker in politics for
another day. The a\*erage woman has not
a political brain, and the only use men
have for her Is to get her to do the dirty
work. ICine times out of ten she does It.
'oo, and receives very little pay {or it."
"Tou don't mean that women do -unfair
work in politics as men do?" I exclaimed.
"Oh, no! of course not," she said, and
1 here was a funny little laugh In her eyes.
"I don't do anything unfair; I only, work

intelligence at my command, and I do

the other side who do unfair and dirty.

"These are the reasons why I believe
m-orr.en should not be in politics. The
i"mptation is too great, and the trend is
downward. Now, good-by! Come and see
me again," said the boss, as a delegation

cjueetloningly.

tooâ strongly and clearly, and to a cer

more knowledge of and Influence in things
political than any other woman in the
rity of Denver.
She Is perhaps the greatest political

she says "No!"
THE Lady Boss Buckley of DeÂ»* /â¢<>Â»
Â«ays "No!" And Ehe says it v* % >
ncntl;-.
She says it every time you ask her
:he question. "Do women purify poli-
Ucs. or are they bettered by the law of
BUffrage in Colorado?" This question has
been asked by many in the last few years.
To-day the Lady Boss Buckley of Denver
answers "No!" and she gives her reasons/
another, we put en a brown wig. a Uttl*
tan\.powder, a cape, and there you are.
In the afternoon when the society maid or
matron comes along to do her voting, aa
she will If there happens to be any real
swell on the ticket, she finds that; sha has
voted already and she only gets the
laugh."
And the chief workings of this immense
system of the making of votes arÂ«
.planned, controlled, carried out by thÂ»
Lady Boss Buckley of Denver. She Is aa
plain ; and unostentatious a little woman
as you could find on American soil; still
she is the most interesting woman In Den
ver to-day, so the men will tell you. with
a - tone of admiration In their voices and
an exclamation or two thrown In such as:
"By jove, she's a stunner!" "A brick!" "A
good one!" The women, too, admire her,
but in a different way, according to their
vocabulary. One will. say: "Oh, yes, in
deed; she's extremely clever, but most un
scrupulous;" or "She's very successful,
but"â or again. "Yes, she's a clever
enough poll, but she's no good. See!"
The voice of admiration, envy, pity or .
jealousyâ and they're all heard In thÂ«
foregoing phrases â make not the sllsht
est difference to Miss Alms. Beswick,
County Investigator, for that Is her trads
when she is not doing politics. . She sim
ply goes about her work systematically,
coolly and practically, like any. .general
putting his troops through tbeir best
paces in anticipation of a display.. And
her followers ebey her as Implicitly as If
she were really their general. Her con
trol over a large class is absolute; they
vote according to her dictates, â¢ no matter
what â¢ their former politics have been.
Her Influence extends to all the working
classes and many of the professional
classes, such as_ school teachers, . doctors,
lawyers and clerks who want .to.' better
their political positions; their vote, or a
large part of it, is at the command of
the little boss.
Her power reaches' over a large army
ot working, girls who are poorly paid and
to whom a few dollars are a luxury,. who
care not a snap about politics, anyway;
who have not an hour in a month to
think of anything but holding their poor
ly paid Jobs ? ami listening for the bell
that wakens them at 5 in the morning.
If you speak of her influence to the ladles
and gentlemen who ride around In their
handsome carriages they smile con
temptuously at toe very idea, and never
dream for a moment what a terrible
power this slight little woman wields
over jthe-.very- laws that govern them. Yet
ihat^she Is al tremendous factor t In mak
ing "Â¦th&e laws no one who studies the
situation can deny, and she is honest in
her belief that laws she assists in mak
ing are for the betterment of the many,
"Oh, yea: they cry fraud," Â»he aatd to
me when I met her next day, and her
deep, humorous, dark gray eyes smiled
mischievously. "Fraud, indeed. Why, I
succeed where they do not; that's the
only fraud that I perpetrate; both parties
work Just alike. How do I do It? "Well,
I work, work, work all the time and I
keep my word. It I promise anything 1
fulfill that promise: that is all; so the
men can rely on me and the women, too;
â¢ but ' the women are harder to convince.
Yes. they talk of fraud. Why, at this
very moment they have bought my lieu
tenant whom I have been training fop
four yearsâ you know, the fat one that
. was talking to you yesterday â they expect
her to deliver half my followers on elec
tion day. Well, she won't do It," and th#
gray eyes laughed again.
"Will you put her in Jail?" I asked.
"6hi no; she's a good sort, when you
know how to handle her. but In politics
you must never get so friendly that you
cannot turn one down and never get so
angry that you cannot call them back
when you want them. No, she is a good
worker, but she talks too much, and lately
she's got .the big head. She won't vote
.this time and she won't deliver a single
buhchVand I won't put her In Jail either.
Pass ... by that long white house In tha
morning. and you'll understand why. Oh,
.we have many good politicians In our or
ganization. Now, good-by until election
day and when you see Chubby again
she'll be able to wear a smaller hat."
I could arrive at no conclusion that
night as to way Chubby shouldn't vote,
and I hastened downtown early next
morning, wondering how I should know.

I realized why Alma Beswlck. 13 tnÂ« Lady
Boas Buckley of Denver.-O|ND the greatest of these Is
/ J charity." Tiius said the Master.
( I Nowadays we translate charity
I into love, but after all it means
the same thine, and is further ex
plained in the commandment, "Love thy
neighbor as thyself."
No one Is so trul y charitable as he who
curtails his own pleasure or comfort to
give another pleasure or comfort. "The
greatest of all virtues Is that .of giving."
Th'jre are people who sneer at the society
girls, saying they are butterflies and
never do a thing for others, "that.self
denial is a virtue to them unknown," and
all that sort of thing. They say that as
long as charity means assisting in a fair
or a social function society girls are
to the fore, but let them be asked to
sevr 4 a flannel petticoat for a poor woman
or visit the homes of the poverty-stricken
they are counted out.' Now a little story
that is told about Jennie Blair refutes
this slander.
One rainy day Miss Blair was rung up
by one of the secretaries of the Doctor's
Daughters and asked to. go to a family
where the mother was dying. Miss Blair
reached the poverty-stricken home before
thf; physicians arrived. The poor mother
was made comfortable, and then theGood
Samaritan took the baby on* her/ knee.' In
came the doctor in a hurry. He -did? not.
know Miss Blair and took it for granted
shfs v,-as his patient's neighbor.
"Come, fly around," he Eaid. â "Drop the
oaby and get to work. Bring basin, water
'*nd towels."
And Miss Blair followed his directions
as If. she had been born and -bred a nurse.
When the doctor went away he said:
"You're all right. Just. keep it up. Mind
the patient, and see that the children are
cared for. Don't forget. the medicine."
A few days later the physician met
Miss. Blair at a reception, but failed; to
connect her with his able assistant: , He
began to talk about society charity work
ers, and said they were absolutely use
less in a sickroom. H(). then recounted
the story of the sick woman and praised
the conduct of "the good little neighbor
who showed such" common sense' in. an
emergency." â¢ â¢" ..
And it was not until somebody told him
that the Good : Samaritan and Miss -Blair
were one and the same . person that he
"caught on.". After, that he only had good
words for society workers. '
Miss Blair, is probably: the most promi
nent â¢ among the young women - of â¢â¢ the
smart . set who are numbered " among the
charitable worker^ If it were' not for
her: energy and enthusiasm /the Doctor's
Daughters would not have held 'â¢ together
Â»o well. She gives money to/ the^'gbod
work, and what is more . valuablef-tlme. r
She personally visits the poor and this
Titian haired angel is thoroughly .beloved
by the; recipients of her bounty.

TRIVIALITIES
THAT
FURNISH
CLEWS FOR
THE POLICE.
' ây VERTBODT carries Bboxit Â¦with
ml him many trivial distinguishing
[ f marks by - means of which a
Vt t shrewd detective can discover his
identity. Take the matter of
clothes. Most men get all their
clothing from the same tailor: but
whsther one does or not, and however
careful he may* be to cut off every tag
and mark, the tailor who made the
clothes can identify them. Thread. stitch-
Ing,, buttons, linings, all tell their own
tale". More especially do these extras
which the tailors call "specials." These
are , the extra pockets, fountain pen or
pencil pockets, eyeglass pockets, watch
pockets lined with wash leather, cigar,
ticket, flask and inner waistcoat pockets.
It will be remembered that it was by
means of a trousers* button that the Iden
tity of , Norcross, the man who tried to
blow Â¦ up - Russell Sage, was discovered.
Then your. finger nails, are liable to be
tray you. Any manicure will tell you
that it takes between 105 and 130 days for
a new finger nail to grow upon the hand
of a man In ordinary health, according to
his age, the nail growing .quicker on the
young and slower on the old. So -any
bruise; or other mark, received on the
white crescent at the base of; the nail,
â¢will take nearly four months to. disappear.
It was a knowledge of this fact that.en
abled a detective to arrest the , forger
Simpson in Paris not long ago. He ieatrned
from Simpson's landlord, in " Bristol, Vhat
a window had fallen upon the man's ha mh,
and bruised his thumb some time In the
first week of Marchâ a few days' before
he disappeared. 'Pour months later, when
the detective met" Simpson in Paris the
black spot was just disappearing from the
tip of the thumbs nail.' It was the only
means of Identification, for Simpson, by
shaving his head and dressing like a
priest, had absolutely changed his ap
pearance.
Some. time ago a criminal was brought
to justice : by . the testimony of his own
watch, one which he had carried for
years. He was charged with murder, and
his defense was an alibi, which he nearly
proved. He said that' he had not been
near the scene of the murder for three
months, and no testimony could be pro
duced that he was not. telling the "truth
until one of the detectives, who at one
time had been a jeweler's apprentice, hap
pened to look at the man's watch.. Inside
the -watch case, written in signs i that only
a watchmaker could read, was the. evi
dence that' the timepiece had been in the
hand3 of a; repairer of watches the day
before the murder. With. the watch In his
hands the detective visited the town
near which the murder had been commit
ted, and went around from one Jeweler's
shop to another until he found a watch
maker who recognized the - timepiece , as
one In which' he had put a new mainspring
on the day preceding the murder. Thus
the alibi was broken down and the pris
oner finally made a full confession.
Again, only one man in -215 is not lop
sided and badly put together- Many a
man who is a fine athlete and In splendid
physical healtlf would be amazed to find
how unevenly he is made up if he should

Â«T* JT RS. CORNWALL objects moÂ«t
/ \ i\ strenuously to 4>eing called one
I V [ of California's most famou* -
V I clubwomen. She contends- that
JL she isn't famous. She is only h
clubwoman, and not a very experienced .
one at that. She has been but a few
years at the business and counts herself
merely a worker without fame.
She is delightfully modest about it all,
and ehe hasn't the least idea that all
the time she has been working her repu
tation for that same work has been grow
ing behind her back. Her labors in the
California Club have helped to make thnt
organization known as one of the great
est bustlers on the coast. . Â¦
She has charge of the social science de
partment, which is one of the three. thit
compose the club. Fifty women meet and
6tudy under her leadership; they listen to
lectures from outsiders on the theory of
social science, and. what is far more to
the point, they work to help social science
advance. This department has the same
keynote as the whole club, which is ac
tivity. . : :'-%&A
People interest Mrs. Cornwall. Their
needs; appeal to her. That is why she has
always been an active officer in the Red
Cros:s. She is at present chairman of the
transportation and relief committee. She
says that Ehe likes men and finds them
a great deal better than they are gen
erally supposed to be. and the fellows that
the Red Crcse helps are every one of .
there, dear to her heart, which is a big "
Although t>he makes a specialty of this
sort Â«f work, ehe never lets it absorb all
of h?r time. She has been a member of
the Ssketch Club for a long-time, and she
has a strong leaning toward art. Her
hotel rooms are full of rare old rugs and
shawls r.tid ornaments'. She says that
ehe cares ubout these 'ust because, they
are beautiful, but that sho hasn't an
ounce of reverence In her soul for a thing
just because it came over in the JIaj
flower or because a Persian maiden >
prayed on It.
*1 don't know whÂ£t my mother will say
Â¦when she sees her cashmere shawl cut
up to make cofa cushions," she eays,
"but Jt ruaiies such good cushions. The ,
colors blend so beautifully. I can't keep
things in a glass case. I think beautiful
thircs were made to be enjoyed. . I gave
away one of the pair of ancestral candle- .,
sticks because cne was enough for mo
and 1 didn't want to pack away the other
and leave it to tarnish."
She is by no mean* a sentimentalist,
you see, but a very practical woman of
thia busy world. Â¦
The -work of which che has most pres
ent .reason to be proud is the Girls' Por
teoiis Club. It Is the child of her depart- 1
ment of the California Club, and it car
ries out her ideas of social scienceâhelp

this type are always beauties.
with the.satre number of brown hairs
one is almost bald. It takes IS), 000 blomte
and VXJKO brown hairs to cover an ordi
nary head. Still another advantage can
be rlaimed by the rpd headed, as a rule;
people thus endowed have the gift of
rhyming and versification. They are also
usually pood mathematicians. In Spain a
woman with red hair is such a novelty
that she i3 considered a beauty, no mat
ter how plain of feature. In New Zealand
a red-headed wornan Is regarded as on the
right road to paradise. In China a baby
with red hair is regarded with a wonder
which place3 it almost among the super
natural.
A homely proverb asserts of the colors
of hair that "black's for beauty." Cer
tain it is that the brunette, whether she
have beauty or not, is generally endowed
with courage, physical strength and en
durance. If the blonde type is dying out
and'we are becoming a. race of dark,
haired people, perhaps we are growing
stronger physically. Pisrment takes the
place of nitrogen and feeds and gives
vigor to the system. Li^ht-haired people
have always been considered more sus
ceptible to disease than those of darker
coloring. Age and worry also show more
p'ainly and quickly in the face and eyes
of the blonde than in those of the
brunette..

THE twentieth century message in
regard to hair, if one would possess
â¢woman's crowning glory, luxuriant
tresses, is "the magnetic touch."
Fashion seats herself in a comfort
able chair, takes a. book for an hour's
rest, and as she reads an attendant goes
over her hair and scalp, tress by tress,
and inch by inch. Utterly oblivious of
all things but the work in hand, the ex
pert places the tips of her fingers lightly
on tlis head, beelnningr at thÂ« forehead.
The whole scalp Is carefully manipulated,
.every movement being followed by the
mind of the operator, firmness of pres
sure, and rapidity of motion being in
creasÂ«sd as the magnetic currents accu
mulate through the fingrers. The move
ments are continued until this force Is
thoroughly spent, every inch of the scalp
being treated. Before the operation the
roots of the hair, but not the hair itself,
are thoroughly wet. either with water or
a lotion.
After the manipulation the hair is care
fully combed; Instead of beginning at the
head, the first combing should start at
the end of the hair. In other words, it is
combed upward to avoid tangling. break-
Ing and tearing out the hair. This rack
ing of the hair also will remove the dust
and fiva free ventilation. The brush is
the next weapon. With this held firmly
in thÂ«: right hand and the hair grasped
Two brushes are necessary for the toilet
of the hairâ a penetrating brush and a
polishing brush.. The penetrating brush:
is made of Btrong, elastic hairs, , but not
so hard or coarse as to Irritate the skin:
The polishing brush should lie made of
The head or scalp cannot be rubbed and
brushed too much; the more attention it
has in this direction t' more healthy
will be the skin; the re healthy its'
functions, the production and mainte
nance of the hair, and, by a reflected
power, the more healthy the individual.
This treatment, which, of course! can
only be given by a person possessed of
a magnetic touch, feeds the hair, by di
recting- a fuller flow of blood to the hair
follicles. One chief reason why hdir fades
and falls o*ut is because it is not fed.
Once a week the magnetic treatment Is
necessary, with a daily manipulation of
the head every, night with the^tlps of the
fingers dipped in tepid water. If the hair
Is very dry dip the fingers in perfumed oil
and rub it well Into the roots of the hair,
as a final stage of the process. Use only a
very littfe oil. '
loosely with the left hand the hair ." is
brushed with a slow, glldlru? motion, every
strand being brushed up, down, right, left,
in semicircles' from the forehead . to the
center of the head, then from the nape
of the neck upward to the same point.
This operation requires from half an hour
to an hour; at the end of the time the
head is all in a glow, and the hair glossy,
elastic and alive with color.

" .-Â¦ A Careful Diet Necessary.' Â»
That there Is a relation between the
scalp and the stomach is a -fact upon
which the wise woman-ponders, and reg
ulates her dietary 'accordingly. 'Â¦'. Certain
I'ooris are detrimental to the growth of the
hair and others nourish it, Baldness is
caused, more or less, by lndlsestlon and
dyspepsia, and gray hairs, too, often ac
cumulate from the same cause3. --Women

is the poorest diet for the. hair; the loss

Â» Hair of Different Hues.
Experts In pigments and gland coloring
tell us that the decline of the blonde type
in England, Ireland, Germany and In the
United States is so rapid as to give cause
for wonder as to the reasons which lead
to this change of type. In New York
City the falling off of the blonde is most
noticeable; not more than 10 per cent of
the women are blonde; but amons men
the proportion lÂ» a'trifle larger. Of the
Tltlnnesque order â that is, the hue be
tween blonde and red, really a reddish
goldâstatistics show that maidens pos
sessing tresses of this shade have a mat
rimonial advantage over blondes 'and bru
nettes, being: preferred as wives. Titlan
hued women have played prominent parts

Red hair â not auburn, but red of an un
compromising shadeâ seems to he as much
of a favorite In the matrimonial market
as Titian tresses, a red-headed old maid
being almost unknown. Perhaps one rea
son of this is that red , hair is a rarity,
only one woman In twenty hnving hair of
this color. People am less liable to bald
ness who have red h^iir than those who
own fair or brown hair. The reason
thereof Is that one red hair is as tb\r\

One cannot walk though the Vatican,
the Louvre, the Elgin room of the British
Museum or any like institution of classic
edification without being struck with the
wonderful beauty of the Roman and
Greek idea's of feminine beauty. It is
unfortunate that while the exigencies of
modern social life have imposed onerous
obligations upon woman, certain atroci
ties of fashion, the corset, for Instance,
have placed an added handicap upon her
chances cf achieving the highest ends. I
am not bo rash as to advocate the imme
diate abolition of the corset, for custom
has made this implement of deformity a
necessity through long abuse. Women
have so Ions bound themselves In this de
vice that to abolish it would be nothing

operative principles. If the enterprise
ever assumes practical form, as I have
every reason to believe, America will be
the first to inaugurate it. It will be a

Since coming to this country, after a
lapse of -.some years, I have not only
found my views thoroughly coincided
with, but also further illustrated in tho
general interest taken by wumen in every
form of what might have hitherto been
called "mt.nly sports": not cniy in' all the
echocls and institutions of general cul
ture abroad in the land, but in the homes
of rich and poor alike, restricted to no
class, from lowest to highest, nor to any
age, from babyhood far on past middle
age. Indeed, I am cf the opinion that the
equal sharing of many forms of sport by
men and women will proceed to a point
where both sexes may enter into competi
tion on ec.ua! terms, without restrictions
or reserve, and without the natural envy
Incident t3 such an enterprise, and that
the Olympian games of the future will see
Â¦women record breakers, without any loss
cf sex distinction or gentle charm.

MAKING A WOMAN ATHLETE SANDOW SHOWS HOW IT SHOULD BE DONEIn the construction of a roof garden it
should be borne in mind that the roof, as
a rule, is not built to be walked upon:
consequently to avoid wear some kind of
false floor should be used, even if it is
only an old piece of matting. The plants
should be grown in boxes or pots , and
raised by a bench to the level of the para'
pet. Boxes and pots should have good*
sized holes bored in the bottom for drain
age. It is not easy to grow such plants
as violets unless you can give them shade
at midday, but marigolds, asters, chrysan
themums, primroses, nasturtiums, gera
niums, wall flowers, mignonette, poppies,
carnations, heliotrope and the old-fash
ioned sweet William are all healthy flow
ering plants and will thrive almost in
spite of you. If on the other hand you
are practically inclined parsley, mint,.,
thyme, sage. lettuce, borage and mustard
and cress will all fill space to advantage:
and if you are still more ambitious and
desire," to be independent of the vegetable
man you can grow sweet corn and cab
bages in pots and good white celery In
boxes, as your neighbors in the Latin
auarter do.
build one of these cuoolas there would to*
a great deal more comfort derived from
the investment and if the opinion of vis
iting: critics is worth anything a material
improvement in appearances. -\ ._

The ; roofs â¢ are ; divided Â¦ from each â¢ other
by high fencesâ ominous looking erections
" One 6t the ' gardens, an Italian's, was
given up almost wholly, to flowers. There
were). carnations,'; chrysanthemums : V and
climbing ? geraniums that overflowed ' the
stone parapet : and ; showed : a gay Â¦ line , ; of

charm of this 1 garden lay not in the flow:"

regular masses "of .architecture^. the, deep

flowed streams of busy people, .and, ' : }_ be

. Embroidered Felts.
Among the novelties seen just now are
the hats of embroidered felt. These are
very expensive -to buy, but very easy to
make. Like so many things that are hand
done, they class very high In the dress
'schemes and are sold at really extrava
gant prices. In .these goods the woman
who is handy -with the needle possesses
advantages untold.
- A bat of tan colored felt, while a simple
thing with a big, floppy brim and a little
top trimming, had embroidered around
the brim a number of red roses and silver
leaves. The effect was new and very
good. The under part of the brim, was
faced with black chiffon.
Velvet hats, especially those in black
velvet, are more than effective, embroid
ered in natural flowers, and many there
are that will follow tneir fashion. The
black velvet that responds more quickly
to embroidery than any other hat under
the sun and comes out a really elegant
affair. The black velvet Gainsborough,
or the Ronrney; or the very stiff black
walking hat, with one side of the brim
higher than the other, can be embroidered
very well. â¢ j
A hat showing a green leaf embroidery
was trimmed with green panne. Another

The Boa Season.
Those who have not already succumbed
to the temptations of the modern boa
must be prepared to do so, now. Under
certain conditions it is not becoming.
The boa does not look well upon the
short woman.
The boa is . not adapted to the double
chin. -. , ,
The boa requires a certain length of
neck.
The boa, to be gracefully worn, must
have the coiffure built high for it.
.In spite of these restrictions It Is to be
seen upon everybody, of every size and
. shape, in the feminine persuasion,

that you're out to shoot him up some.

the time I discovers this yere foible of
Jerry's. I never gets a shot. At the sight
of that Colt's Jerry evolves a howl, an'
them antelopes simply hits two or three
high places an' is miles away. Shore,
they thinks Jerry is some new breed of
demon.
"When I turns to note the cause of Jer

over Tom's back an' Is sobbln* an' shed

"But while 1 don't resent 'em none by

which I has to gyard. You-all recalls
how long ago I tells you of Jerry's beln*
a thief. Shore, he can't he'p it; he's a
born kleptomaniac that a-way. Least
wise 'kleptomaniac' Is what Colonel Ster
rett calls it once when he's teflln' me of
a party who's afflicted sim'lar, back In
Texas yonder.
'* 'Otherwise this yere gent's a heap re
spectable,' says the colonel. 'Morally
speakin' thar's plenty who's worse a
whole lot. Of course, seein" he's crowdln'
forty years, he ain't so plumb innocent.
He ain't no debyootanty; still, he ain't
no crime-wrung debauchee. I should say
he grades in between. But deep down in
his system, this yere person's a klepto
maniac. An' at last this weakness gets
its hobbles off an' he turns himse'f loose
an' begins to take things right an' left.
No, he don't get put in Huntsville; they
sees he's locoed an' corrals him in one
of them asylums where thar's nothln"
loose an*- little kickln' 'round, an' thar
fore no temptations.'
"Takin* the word then from Colonel
Sterrett. Jerry Is a kleptomaniac. I used
former to hobble Jerry, but one mornln*
I'm astounded to see what looks like snow
all about my camp. Bein' she's In Joone

WOLLVILLE STORIES:"A11 this time she was waiting for a
chance to appear here on the stage in an
English part. She was alone a good deal of
the time, her husband, the Count Bozenta,
being a great deal in the south on ac
count of his health. So I did a good deal
of the looking around and the business ne
gotiations lor her. No one could speak
English faster than I could when I got
ready. That was in the days when John
McCullough was a theatrical manager.
But then Modjeska was what might be
called totally unknown in the theatrical
world here.
"She was a beautiful creature, with a
grace that I have never seen equaled. I
was a young woman then and I loved the
madame always.
"Then began a struggle, which often
lasted for nights as well as davs with her.
For three months and a half we studied
Â»nd then she had a chance to use her Eng
lish. When I saw that it was hard for her
to learn the conversational English I pro
posed that she should only learn the Eng
lish of the various parts she was anxious
to play in that language. So we began
with the study of Cleopatra, a part that
Â«he had never done In Poland or anywhere
else. She spoke, of course. French and
German very well, and once In a while
she would come to an English word hav
lns a. sound something like a word la
either of these languages. Then sho.
would make the Queerest kind of a. hier
oglyphic on the page over this word to
help her remember It. 'She had a wonder
ful . memory and at the end of three and
a half months she had memorized in Eng
lish the parts of Cleopatra, Adrienne Le
couvreur. Juliet and OpStlia.
She speaks of Modjeska. as of a close
and very dear friend, and never tires in
praising her. I asked her. when her
friendship with the actress began.
"Well, the first time I met her, I
think," she said, "'and it has lasted ever
since. Toil knew after the colony down
near Anaheim, which failed to work well
financially, even with fo majiy clever peo
ple and altruistic principles in it, Modjes
ka and her husband came up here in the
spring cf 1S77. a year after their arrivai
In America. They stopped on O'Farrelt
street, a few doors from where I then
lived. J-!y people were from Pomcrania
nnd I felt almost a Pole. Moreover. I had
a great desire to meet the gracious wo
man Â¦whom I often saw, and 1 was de
lighted when I had a chance to serve her.
Modjes-ka waF very eager to learn the
English language, and I heard she wanted
i lady to come every day for ?ome hours
and teach and converse with her. As
luck would have It I. met her at her own
house very soon after this and I raaSe
arrangements to become her teacher -in
English. i

X. made "her American debut. Per
haps the story of that debut, witb its
attendant struggles, has never been told
In a more Interesting way than as re
counted by Miss Josephine Tucholsky, a
clever woman, who. as instructress In
English to Madame Modjeska. did a great
pervlee toÂ» the American stage. She Is
enthralled In the bonds of loyalty and
8dmiratlon- which the lovely characteris
tics of the great actress seem to entwine
around the hearts of all those who know
her. ;
"I think a great tribute to the lasting
genius and lovely personality of Modjeska
was the ovation tendered to her in Po
land on her last visit there. She was es"
pedally and wonderingly gratified, too at
the progress art had made In her native
country since her days in Warsaw. ) There
are a number of famous people in the ar
tistic and musical world who have a good
deal to thank Modjeska for. She was one
of the principals in a benefit given to
raise money for Paderewski to go to VI- Â¦
-
"Since then I have always kept in toucii
with Modjeska. and very pleasant have
been the meetings I have had with h"fcr
when she has been here, i expect to
spend some time with her this summer at
Arden. her beautiful home in Orange
County. To me she is a most remarka

her dramatic genius. She Is both a fino
linguist and a poet. She is regarded In
Poland as an authority on her own lan

She will be on the stage as long as she

something else, for she has too much cre

the designs for all her costumes. I re
member an incident of her illness a few
years ago that showed the ambition of
her nature. From the nature of her ill:
ness, caused by a clot of blood on the
jugular, her left arm was useless to her
for three months and had to be kÂ»m
pointing upward. With her right hand
she wrote a fairy story in Polish for her
little grandson and illustrated It with
the most exquisite drawings in black and
white. The story, too. if I remembeT had
a queer motive: every one in it was'suD
posed to be the color of their qualities
and the good and bad qualities had sig
nificant colors. Â¦ B
"Soon after the termination of the en
gagement at the California Modjesku
made a tour of the State with 'CamilJe'
and 'Delilah* added to her rcpertoin?.
She had also succeeded in mastering in
English by this time part of the tragedv
of Marie Stuart, which, she afterward
made so famous in America, and aÂ»pari
of the lines of Beatrice In 'Much Ado
About Nothing.' Success was the rule
from that on. and after the return from
the tour Sargent, the Eastern theatri
cal manager, who was here tnen, signed
a contract with her and she. soon fol
lowed him to begin a series of appear
ances in the East.
"The next morning at rehearsal, when
John .McCullough went to again congrat
ulate Modjeska, he suddenly burst into
tears. Recovering himself, he exclaimed.
'I bring you the tribute of my tears.'
And that was only one of many tribute*
of the same sort. The newspapers be
came as vociferous in her praise- as they
had before been silent, and the- theater
was packed nightly. McCullough was
given a benefit and played Hamlet. Mod
jeska giving a most wonderful interpreta
tion ot Ophelia in Polish. She had played
this part many times in her own coun
try, and had even spent several months
in a madhouse lo study the various
phases of the 'inmates. - â¢
"After the play we had a little supper

man who has since had a large xneasui j
of fameâ Henry Sienkiewicz, the novel

"Nicandria" ' is a weird Â¦ and naughty

this side of . the pond. London" was"
startled by it. It is the story of > a mis
chief-making lady who is brought â¢ from

against letting the serpent out from its
box, and every one obeys strictly, until, a'

the mischief-making lady, who thereupon â¢
proceeds to turn things .topsy-turvy in

asses and so on through/ the 'dramatis,

advertising advantage that the risky ele
ment gives. It was sriven to the Alcazar
by David Belasco, who has. the American:
rights, and the- local house will be -the'
firft in America to produce It. â¢ > T-J'.i--y-
"For the White Rose" Is still another
new production, or aÂ«5 good asnew.~ It has';
been tried on one or. two small Eastern;
dogs, but San Francisco will be; the* first,
of the big.cities;to see it.'. It Is an. Irish;
historical drama, historical in the senso!
that all the present day faddish' plays are
âa background of history is painted over'
Â¦with colors of fiction. -The War of the'
Roses forms the theme of the plot: V' r .

THE Alcazar has always done more
than its share in the line of pat
ronizing home industry and this
season it is getting ready to give a
chance to three local talents.
Clay Greene, Francis Powers and Char
lotte Thompson have all been encouraged
in their time by the little O'Farrell street
house; they have all been given a show^
with the best of them, have had their
I.ilays produced at as much expense and
with as much advertising as if they had
been Henry Arthur Joneses or Pineros. .
Â£.nd they could not complain that budding
talent was not boomed. It was up to
them to show what they could do and
they have good or otherwise ac
cording to their deserts. Without the lit
tle Alcazar to be a foster-father to their
manuscript offspring they might still be
beprging for a chance at managers' doors.
This season, all in one season, mind you,
we shall have a chance to see the work
of three local writers. If you realize in
any measure what the expense of a pro
duction is, for even one week, you know
that this means a big chance. The man
agement must either draw good houses or
lose hundreds of dollars of hard cash.
Still the Alcazar is going to risk it. It
is going to take another chance en that
brave or foolhardy Francis Powers, which
ever the years shall prove him to be;
the man who made for San Francisco its
greatest dramatic success in that hyp
notic play, the "First Born," and caused
a J.ai-d-vrorldrg iranagerrent twice to lose
tv^rd -earned money in "When Turk Meets
Creek" and "Mother Earth." But Powers
has a certain reputation to back him; it
is still mere guesswrrk to reckon the
probable success of the play by Charles
F. Bryant and Mrs. Lotta Coleman. ' They
are as yet practically untried.
Bryant has every odds in his favor In the
line of practical stage training. He has
been stage manager of the Alcazar for
yÂ«?ars past, and the scrapbooks only know
how many plays he has put through in
that time. The stock company work cov
ers everything from French farce to
Sbakespeare, and by the time a man has
looked after the practical detail of a hun
dred or so out of this infinite variety he
ought to know the technique of the stage.
That, of course, is only one-half of the
tiling, and artistic and commercial/ opin
ions differ 'as to whether it is the bigger
Â¦ . ' ? - '
or the'smaller half. It is too booh Co" even
guess whether Bryant has originality in
his conceptions, for even the' title of the
play Is unrevealed owing to copyright.pe
culiarities. This much is toldâ the scene
Is laid in rural New .England, probab'y
among Mary E. Wilkins*. types, and. Mr.
Bryart went East last summer to study
the local color. : . .
Mrs. Coleman is an Eastern woman
now, a Californlan originally, and- on?
whom Â¦ Sari Francisco remembers as ? a
writer. Her stories were mostly laid in
early California days, in the northern
part of the State, above the mines, where
primitive pioneer life 1 - flourished./ Mr.
Bryant is already collaborating, with her
on another play, laid among the scenes
and people of her stories. "" â¢ '
As for Powers' new play, it Is as wildly
eccentric as all of them. It is called "The
Enlightenment" and deals, with'. Buddha
and reincarnation. /Like all of his, it must
be' a big success or a' big failure â he Is
never non-committal. .
The play Is founded upon the life of
Gautama Buddha and Is. by. far the most
ambitious thing that Powers has -yet
done. It Is a poetical drama of deep eth
ical purpose. Ahdra of the first act, after
ward Prince Gautama., "resolves never
under any circumstances to take the life
of his fellowman and gradually comes to
the conclusion that to take, the life of
anything is wrong. .An act of mercy to a
savage beast encompasses his death,' but
places him in the next Incarnation con
siderably higher, where he comes to life
aeain as Prince Gautama in act second."
The scene in which, he gives his life for
the starving tigress is the fiercely dram
atic, ending of. the first act. j* The scene
is laid in the mountains. The cry of , a
tiper is heard coming from a , covered
hollow.

Babcock's manner of conveying the truths
.which he tried to teach: .^
"Spirituality is "best "manifested on the
ground, not in the air. Rapturous ' day
dreams, flights of heavenly fancy, long
ings to see the Invisible,' are less expen
sive and less expressive than the plain
doing of duty. To have bread - excite
thankfulness and a; drink â¢ of water send
the heart to God is better than sighs' for
the unattainable. To plow a straight fur

and that is all I'm doing.. Keep yourself
thinking that you can do better than I
can, and don't let yourself think anything

do so.' Then, after a pause for breath,
he added, with a twinkle in his eye, 'But
I've got a pretty good start on you, and
don't intend to let you or any one else
catch up with me if I can help it.',; . !

"I replied that this would prevent my
having the necessary 'freedom of move

"TVe now come to the regency of the
Queen, where we shall see, as in a pic
lure, the various revolutions of fortune;,
of what nature Is that climate called the*

should they estime themselves who are
not fated to live fhcre. The air Is never
sweet cr serene for any one. Even those
who apparently in perfect prosperity are

ill of that cents pious malady, ambition,
which Lill3 their peace, gnaws their
heart, rcr.us fumes to their head and
Mme. do Motteville at times appears
1o be something of a philosopher. Scat
tered among the historical notes are her
reflections upon the careers of the people
of whom she writes, or upon the events
In which they play a part. Accustomed
to the dazzling brilliancy of a court re
nowned for the perfection of its graced,
Mme. de Motteville, thanks to the stabil
ity of her character, was unaffected by
the glitter which surrounded her to such
an extent that, while she was able to ap
preciate its beauty she could see
beneath its artificiality the play of natural
emotions. It is the combination of good
sense and wit displayed Â¦ by Mme. de
Motteville in writing her memoirs which
makes them afford more entertainment
than can be derived from a reading of
the bare facts of history. Apropos of
these remarks may be quoted the passage
which owns the account of the regency
of Anne, in which Mme. de Motteville.
after a long experience of the good and
the .evil of court life, sums up her esti
mate of its worth.
"She seemed to me as beautiful as any
of those who formed her circle. Her fea
tures were not delicate, having even the
defect of too thick a nose, and she wore,
in Spanish fashion, too much rouge; but
phe was fair, and never was there a finer
Fk'n than hers. Her eyes were perfectly
beautiful: gentleness and majesty united
in them: iheir color, mingled with green,
made her glance the mere vivid and full
of all the charms that nature gave them.
Her mouth was small and rosy, the smile
admirable and the Up* had only enough
pf the Austrian family to make them
more beautiful than many that claimed
to be more perfect. The shape of her
fae? war handsome and the forehead well
made. Her hands and arms were of sur
r.p.rsiris' beauty, and all Europe has heard
their praises; their whiteness, without
oxagceration. equaled that of snow; poets
could not pay enough when they wished
to laud them. Her bust was very fine,
n-ithout being perfect. She was tall, and
her bcarinp lofty but not haughty. She
had great charms in the expression of her
face, and her beauty imprinted in the
hearts of thote who saw her a tenderness
which did not lack the accompaniment of
veneration and respect. Besides these per
fections she had the piety of her mother.
Queen Marguerite of Austria, dead, in the
odor of sanctity, who. having had the
care of her daughter's education, had im
printed in her heart the sentiments which
filled her own. This it was that produced
in her thr.t great inclination to virtue
Â¦which drew to her the grace that God
gave her throughout her life to prefer it
to all things else."
Mme. de Motteville discusses but briefly
the reign of Louis XIII and the ministry
cf Richelieu. The memoirs are given up
principally to a description of the re
gency of Anne, the career of Mazarin and
the first years of the reign of Louis XIV.
Still, within the compass of a few chap
ters. Mme. de Motteville gives an excellent
account, though one necessarily con
densed, of the condition of France on the
death of Henry IV, of the reign of Loui3
XIII and of the most important people at
court. Anne of Austria she describes a3
fellows:
Mme. de Motteville was in a position to
speak â¢with an intimate knowledge of
much which she described. She was lady-
In-waltlng to Anne of Austria and was
the intimate friend and confidante of her
royal mistress. She was a woman of ad
mirable tact and discretion. So great was
her reputation for an ability' to keep se
cret the confidences reposed In her and
for sense and good judgment that the ac
counts of many of the events of whicn
ehe writes were discussed with her by tho
chief actors. Her memoirs are valuable
chiefly as a supplement to the history of
her time. Mme. de Motteville had that
liking for the discussion cf personalities
which seems so trivial when it concern*
itself with people of one's own time,' and
yet which becomes dignified by distance
into eomcthlng of real value to the stu
dent of history, giving him. as it docs, an
intimate knowledge of the makers of his
tory which is not to be gained from h
formal chronicle of events.
THE memoirs of Madame de Motte
ville on Anne of Austria and Her
Court" are issued in a fine edition
of three volumes by Hardy. Pratt
& Co. These memoirs contain a his
tory of Frame and of. French court life
from the death of Henry IV in 1610 to the
oeath of Anne in 1666. This long period,
comprising: as it does the reign of Louis
XIII and part of that of Louis XIV, with
ihe careers of Richelieu and of Mazarin,
ie particularly full of Interest to the stu
dent of French history. The account of
in!* lime given by Mme. de Motteville m
rarefully minute and exact. She herseJf
fays cf the accuracy of her observations
on contemporary life and manners: "I
usually write only of what I know my
self or from tho?e who have been either
nctors or confidants." As a consequence
the pictures which she draws of peop'e
and events are Interesting, as well for the
fidelity cf their reproduction as for their
Intrinsic interest. v
ductlons could equal his charming story,
"Amos Judd." The book came out a fow
years ago and although its first uypear
ance was a most modest, edition, it wa3
received with great enthusiasm und won
it3 way among the books one wishes to
keep and enjoy. The story i:; a unique
one, involving they question of environ
ment and heredity. The hero, Ames Judd.
is an East Indian Prince, who: is spirited
away from his people in the midst of nn
uprising,' taken to America and brought
up on a New England farm.
To give the story in detail would de
stroy the charm for many, and it is a
book that all should enjoy. A spirit of
melancholy pervades it throughout, but
the charm is irresistible and the whole
tale thoroughly unique and delightful.
Those who have read it will enjoy, again
this latest edition, which is very Â¦ tittrilc
tive, and those who do not yet know it
have a rare treat in store for them. .(.Pub
lished by Charlas Scribner's Sons, New
York. Price $1 50.)
All through the memoirs Mme. de
Motteville sings the praises of Anne of
Austria, and yet praises not unqualified.
If this Queen does not appear in histories
as great and as good as her lady-ln-wait
ing .would have us believe, there may be
reason for concluding that while, on the
one hand a long intimacy with the Queen
may have prejudiced Mme. de Motteville
in her /avor, yet pn the other the harsher
estimate of history may be as unfair in
its way. It is scarcely probable that of a
woman without great worth Louis XIV
would have said, as he did of Anne of
Austria, "The Queen, my mother, was
not only a great Queen; she deserves to
be put In the ranks of the greatest
Kings.
Of Anne, Mme. de Motteville says in
conclusion: ' - -^
"Tho King, as soon as he saw his Min
ister approaching his end, showed that In
the future he meant to govern his king
dom. He said that he did not approve of
the life of -a do-nothing King, who let
himself be led by the nose. He added that
he saw plainly that people might re
proach him for having done what he
blamed; but that his past conduct must
be attributed to the esteem he had had
for the Cardinal on account of his ability,
and to the habit of submission and de
pendence to which his childhood had ac
customed him. The, Queen, his mother,
who had felt the burden of the yoke
which she had Imposed upon herself, was
resolved in the future to submit to no
other power than that of the King, her
son; she was therefore most desirous that
he should work himself, and for himself.
She was not ambitious, but she was' a
sufficiently good mother to wish to help
him in every way she could."
â¢ The remainder of the memoirs contains
an account of the plans for the marriage
of the young King, the death of Mazarin,
the establishment of absolute power in
the hands of the King and the death of
Anne. Immediately after the "death of
Mazarin, Louis XIV assumed the author
ity which had for so many years been
given over to the two Illustrious Ministers
of slate. ' Mme. de Motteville has this to
eay of the sentiments of Louis in regard
to the rights of Kings:
"The "English court spent some time at
St. Germain, where it was little frequent
ed by our Frenchmen. Scarcely any one
visited either the Queen of England or
the King, her son. Certain great English
lords had followed the fortunes of their
King, and these composed his court. Their
solitude is not surprising; ill fortune was
its cause; they had no favors to bestow.
Theirs were crowns without power, which
gave them no means of elevating men or
of doing them benefits. They had follow
ers enough v/hen wealth, grandeur and
dignities were theirs, for those brought a
crowd around their persons. The unhap
py Queen had formerly had joys and
treasures in abundance, for I have heard
Madame de ChevreUse and many others
who saw her In her days of splendor say
that the court of France had nothing like
thÂ«* beauty of hers. But her joy was now
a subject of despair: her past riches mads
her feel the more her present poverty."
This same fickleness showed itself ami!
different conditions and among a different
class of society. The widowed Queen of
Charles I of England and her son, the fu
ture Charles II, had taken refuge in Pari3
after the execution of the King. Mme. de
Motteville has this to say of their condi
tion there:
"When the King and Queen arrived the
crowd parted the gendarmes, tho cavalry
escort and the whole suite from the royal
carriage, blessing the King and Queen and
speaking to the advantage of Mazarin.
Some said he was handsome, others held
out their hands to him and assured him
that they liked him very much; others de
clared thaf they would go and drink his
health."
During a lull In the war of the Fronde
there occurred an incident which illus
trates well the' fickleness of the populace.
The Queen and her Minister had decided
to brave danger' 1 and enter Paris, the
stronghold of the Frondeurs. It was at a
time when the unpopularity of 'Mazarin
was at its height. "The Queen arrived in
Paris with the King on the ISth of.Aug
ust. We now wondered at a marvel which
was scarcely believable in view of what
had passed. The King and the Queen
were received with acclamations and with
the customary shouts of joy practiced by
the populace on such occasions. â¢ * *
Tho entrance of the King on that day waÂ»
a veritable wonder find a great victory
for the Minister. Never did so great a.
crowd follow the King's carriage; and s t
seemed amid that public gayety as' If tho
past were a dream. The hated Mazarin
sat in the royal carriage beside the Prince
of Conde, attentively looked at by the
people, who said to one another, iis if thcy
had never before seen him: 'That is Maza
rin.' Some, observing a carriage with the
sides carefully closed, cried out that he
was within it and Insisted, on eesins him;
but this was more in jest than malice*
"Cardinal Mazarin did v%-ith intuits what
Mithridates did with poisonsâ which, in
stead of killing him, came at last through
constant use to nourish h!m. They served
him to acquire with the Queen the mem
of suffering for her sake and of being th3
victim of the unjusr .passions of^ the
Kiqg's subjects."
often deprives them of reason. This dis- â¢
ease gives them a continual disgust for
better things. They are ignorant of the
value of equity. Justice," kindliness. The
sweetness of life, of innocent pleasures,
of all that\hc sages of antiquity counted
as good, seems to them ridiculous. They
are incapable of knowing virtue and fol
lowing its precepts, unless chance may
happen to remove. them from this region.
Then, If they can by absence be cured of
their, malady, they become wise, they .be
come* enlightened, and no man can be
come so good a Christian or so tritfy a
philosopher as a disillusioned courtier."
The memoirs contain a full account of
the rebellion of the Fronde, in which
some of the leading nobles united in an
endeavor to regain the political power
which had been wrested from them by
Richelieu and Mazarin. The stanch sup
port riven at first to the cause of the
King by the Prince de Conde. his gradual
disaffection and his ultimate withdrawal
1o the party of the Prince of Cor.ti and
Cardinal de Retz. is described with a min
m<:ness commensurate with the import
ance which the treason of a Prince of the
blood would naturally wsume in the eyes
of one who believed in the divine rijjht
of kings. Mme. de Molteville had r.o" per
sonal reason to like Mazarin, yet, either
from her loyalty to Anne, or from tha
instinctive dislike of a French noble for
a party which could ally itself with tha
canaille against the sovereign, her rym
pathies show very strongly for the side
of the King. Still, her descriptions of thÂ«
leaders of the court party and of-, the
pilncipal Frondeurs is on the whole fair
and unbiased. Mme. de Motteville cou'd
see clearly that there was much
that wa/s admirable in the conduct,
of Conde, and that the cause of the court
party was not without ita weakness. A
remark which .she makes about Mazarn
hints at her attitude toward him and in
cidentally shows something of her tren
chant wit. Mazarin was at the time de
scribed the- subject of the most- bitter
e?-.tcrations on the part of the Frondeurs.
Mme de Mottevitle says:
"She made no paradeof her noble qual-.
itles; she rarely spoke of herself or her ;
feelings; "they had to be drawn' from her i
heart or her soul by the T force of action 1
which sometimes obliged her to speak out

had taken more pains to let' their great
ness be seen she ; would have won. more
praises during her life; but we may quote
with truth of her this verse of Psalm
xlv, which served as a text to one of the
finest of the funeral orations . that were
made upon her after her death:
"Omnis gloria eius filiae regls ab intus."

The International Monthly begins thÂ«
new year with a number of strong and
attractive articles, all for the most part
devoted to the larger themes and inter
ests. Associate Justice Brewer of the Su
preme Court in an admirable study of the
"Jury" pronounces unequivocally in favor
of retaining the system, especially be
cause It secures the direct co-operation of
the people in the administration of jus
tice, but he condemns without any re

ings which have done bo much to destroy
public confidence in its efficiency. Tha
seat of the evil, he finds, above all else.
Is the rule requiring unanimity, which,
indeed, as he believes, "threatens tha
overthrow of the whole system." To abol
ish this rule would be to lighten and les
sen the struggle of counsel over the "sin
gle helpful juror," who by his Ignorance,
or. worse, so often defeats the ends of Jus

bution on "Things Municipal" (in New
York) declares that if the recent victory
over Tammany is to be permanent good
government must be made to appeal more
directly in the way of practical benefit to
the average man, who is as yet but too
little sensible of the disgrace of a corrupt
municipal administration. Mr. Kelly pro
poses to win -the "dweller of the Five

Mr. William Archer's eighth "Real Con

Archer manages to induce his subject to

esting "Lounger."
With the January number of the Critic
begins a notable series of papcr3 on "Tha
Great Reviews," the present installment
covering "The English Reviews," the text
being by Mr. Arthur Waugh. The article
is fully illustrated after portraits of the
founders and editors of the English Re- ,
views, from the "Edinburgh Review" on- f
ward, and is a complete sketch of their
inception and principles. Mr. Waugh
writes with interest and enthusiasm of
the work accomplished by these- reviews,
and his article serves admirably to intro
duce the subsequent papers. Lovers of.
, Dickensâ and they are innumerableâ will
Â¦welcome the two papers on Dickens, also
fully illustrated after portraits and draw
ings. Mr. B. XV. Matz writes of "Dickens
and His Illustrators," and Mr. Georga
Glssing pays, in his appreciation entitled
"Dickens in Memory," a delicate tribute
to a man who in many respects has been
his inspiration. The tive unpublished por
traits of Dickens add substantially to the
novelty of these two papers. Among the
more serious contributions are reviews of
"The Letters of John Richard Green," by
Mr. George Louis Keer, and Mr. A. I. du
P. Coleman's paper on "Essays Worth
Reading." Mr. Beer, himself a close stu
dent of history, reviews the career of
Green with sympathy and with scholar

he comments upon. Of a semi-literary,

stamps appear on the original letter, aa

special care of being covered by glass

were printed and distributed by the Ha

A curiosity in American stamps are the
2-cent- Pan-American stamps on wh'ch
the train Is inverted. About four sheets
of these with this error, or 400 in all, were
issued.' They were sold to a commercial
house "and -use of them was begun before
the error was discovered. ' Then collectors
flocked to secure- them at $100 each. The
1-cent Inverted? steamship is also shown
in blocks of four. - * - Â¦Â¦ Â¦
are two of the St. Louis 20-cent stamps,
known to have sold as high as $3800 each.
.They have an interesting history.. Before
the United â¢ States Government Â¦- issued
stamps the city of St. Louis employed a
card engraver to engrave six stamps on
a: plate the size of . a' card. - rhe \aluos
were four 5-cent stamps and two tens.
For. a long time it was thought that tlieso
were all the stamps issued by St. Lou!s.
but later it was discovered that they had
need of some 20-cent .stamps. Â¦Â¦ The- sam
, engraver being called upon, took the same
plate, turned it over, beafout on copper
the original two fives and inserted the 20
instead.. The stamps as printed show
traces of; the amendment. These 20-cent
ers now rank as therarest stamps of the
United States. >, . . - . â¢,'.;. '

itamps are very handsome and perfect
specimens of engraving. They have an
flHSS^ifi Portion in the large book
rÂ«l i, th V the . stamps cf Great Britain
and her American provinces, making a
:ollection alone worth $35,000. The plate
numbers or engravers' marks of the Ene

utc are they, and so cleverly hidden
irnong the larger designs of: the margin
-f the stamp. .
A block -of four sixpenny Canadian
stamps, unused and in mint condition
is grazed at with envious eyes as a raritv
unknown in any other collection. An
other page consists of Canadian sixpenny
and twelve-penny black unused. The Aus
tralian and British colony stamps shown
are worth $25,000. Of these the "Connell"
stamp is one of the most interesting, from
the quaint bit of human vanity and hH
tory connected with it. It is a stamp of
New Brunswick, but unlike its con
temporaries in that it does not bear the
engraved head of the Queen. Instead
.here is the portrait of a somewhat sheep
ish looking gentleman, with retreating
whiskers and a general "Oom Paul" air
And thereby hangs the vanity. The'gen
tleman Is Charles Connell of "Woodstock
N. B.. Postmaster General at the time
these stamps were issued. $ He Uhought it
would be a pleasant change to seo his
own face on the stamps and at the same
time relieve her Majesty, so he had the
change made. The issue of these 5-cent
stamps was suppressed - almost as soon
as it was finished, and the gallant Connell
lost his berth and salary of six hundred
pounas a year, or as an. old poem has it:
Sax hundred pounds to see hlÂ« face
Posting around from place to place.
But fame has at least a place , for him.
as stamp collectors are eager to I buy his
stamp pictures at Â£25 each. * :

Among the rarest unused ' stamps in Mr,

quite a fad with collectors to make a
page at least of Queen's head stamps.
A scarlet book of auaint Japanese de
sign is- a volume full of treasures in thÂ«
shape of rare stamps of that nation
Mr.' Crocker has also a very inter
ssting and. valuable collection ol
Western franks, representing all the .early
letter-carrying? express companies, such
as, the Pony express, Freeman's, Hum
boldt's, Weaverville and Adams & Co.
One .specimen, of the frank of the Central
Overland California and Pikes Peak Ex
press Company, is valuable, and â¢ unique
in its story. It Is stamped in green Infc
and for a long time no one could make out
the- cause -of the error, as all the other
franks of the company were stamped in
black. This was in green and bearing
date March 17, which .-suggested to a Ger
man that the expressman must have been
of Irish nationality and had changed the
color of the ink on his stamp in honor oi
"ould St. Patrick." Which was undoubt
edly the case.
. That was the opinion of Henry J.
Crocker when he succeeded in getting
two of these rarities to add to his col
lection, which stands seventh, among the
largest collections of the world, and Which
has .made his name a famous one, amoiijj
connoisseurs in stamps. Mr. Crocker's
many handsome books of stamps are es
timated to be r -vorth two hunured thou
sand dollars in their entirety, and his
collection of Hawaiian stamps is the
finest in the world and has not been ap
proached in point of rarity or. value. The
rinest collection of stamps on the globe is /
that of Ferrari of* Paris, the second best'
is the Tapling collection, now in the
British Museum, and then follow in tha
crder named the collections of Beitfus,
Iilirabaua, Dcveen, Schroeder and H. J.

There are in the United States no less
than 2du,viW active stamp collectors.

Brown Tells. His Story.
In answer to Questions he said:
"I was In bed at the time of , the colli
sion. My room was on the starboard
side on the main deck, close to No. 2
hatch. The moment I was awakened I
dressed and rushed up on the saloon
deck. I took a look around, saw the Max,
but did not notice any lights on her. I
THE investigation of the collision
between the lost Walla Walla
and the French bark Max was
nearly concluded yesterday.
There are but a few more wit
nesses to be examined.
Alec Holmes, boatswain on the Walla
Walla, was the first witness examined
yesterday.
"I was not on deck," hÂ© Bald, "when
the boats collided. As soon as I heard
the crash I rushed above and lowered
elcht boats before I left the ship. I^was
In charge of boat No. 8. Six of the crew
were with me. I was the last person to
get into that boat. One of the oars was
In good condition and the other was
broken off. The boat had considerable
water In her and the provisions put in
her were lost After we pulled away we
heard cries and tried to locate them, but
it was too dark."
"Did you see the French bark Max
when you first came on deck?" he was
asked.
"Yes, sir. She -was about 100 feet cX.
â¢with her bow toward us."
"Did she show any lights?"

* ..BERLIN. Jan. ll.-The \ North German
Gazette to-day corrects the statement,
credited to -Baron von' Loen, to the. effect
that Emperor William had decided to send
the Baron, who Is a large land owner, of
Silesia, .to the' United States' to study
agriculture and. kindred subject's. "The
paper says' that -'through the Emperor
Baron ; von Loen obtained Â¦ a round-trip
ticket for a voyage to .the .West Indies
and Mexico," on ; board' the ' steamer .Vic
toria â¢ Louise, . and that heV had no . more
received a commission froxri the\Emperor
to study, agriculture in the United States
than had any other private ' person who
had been the recipient. of: a similar favor
in the. way of transportation." '. ' /:
"Yes; I Eaw a green light on her. . When
I came on deck I also saw a flash of a
torch."
Continuing-, the witness testified that his
boat landed at the lagoon eighteen miles
from Trinidad the following day;' that
four minutes after his boat pulled away
from the Walla Walla she sank; that her
captain . and officers â¢ were still on deck.
He said he thought the collision occurred
at 4:10 a. m., but was not positive.
Charles Brown, third assistant engineer
of the steamer, was next called. He testi
fied that he had made the following state
ment In writing:
"I, Charles Brown, formerly third as
sistant engineer of the steamship Walla
Walla, which was sunk In a collision Just
above Cape Slendoclno on the morning of
January 2, depose and say:
Saw Vessel Was Doomed.
"I was a:Heep at the. time. The Jar
awoke me and I went on deck to see
what the trouble was. I saw a big hole
at the No. 2 hatch and a sailing vessel
off at a short distance. I then went down
Into the engine-room and found no water
there. I then went up and looked down
No. 1 hole to ses if it was possible to shift
the cargo over to starboard' bo as to get
the hole In the ship's side out of the wa
ter. I saw there was no hope for the ves
tel, so I went up on deck and helped get
the lifeboats ready. I got Into a boat,
with probably twelve other men and land
ed at Trinidad on Friday morning, June S,
with only seven men left.".
The witness told of leaving the sink
ing ship In boat No. 7 and that It cap
sized and four cf the party were drowned.
He said that Quartermaster Wilson was
one of those lost. He said he saw Wilson
come on deck fu'.ly dressed, the balance
of his testimony simply being in line with
the foregoing statement.
Rudolph Ncilscn. a sailor on. the Walla
Walla, was recalled. He said he was In
charge of a boat containing eleven "pas
sengers and three members of the crew
and that they were picked up by the tug
Ranser and taken into Humboldt. He
said he invited the captain and ether offi
cers to get into the boat before she left
the steamer, but the captain yelled, "La-j
dies first!"
â¢Cecil Brown, one of the heroes of tt>Â«
met Captain Hall in the companlonway.*
He was talking to the chief engineer. I
was ordered to go down and Bee if there
was any water In the hold. I sounded the
bilge3 and found one of the pipes broken.
Having reported this to ' the captain, I
was ordered to go to my boat, which was
No. 4 en the starboard Elde.
"I helped put- it in' the water. -I then
rushed over to the port side and helped
lift four boats ln^o the water. The first
person I met was Mrs. Errlcson.and her
children. I tried to get her Into one of
the boats, but she refused to leave unless
ehe had her husband. As there were
other lives to look after I left hen , I
continued to help other lady possengers
until' the boat sank. I left the deck and
swam to one of the life rafts, and ( seeing
a lady in the water I helped her Ho get
on It. I then' swam to another raft, but
finding it crowded went to another and
got on . board. I . remained on the raft
with the first officer, fourth cook, Mr.
Errlcscn and bis eon for thlrty-slx
hour3."
1 As the witness was unable to fix the
time the collision happened Second Officer
Lupp offered his watch as evidence of
the hour the steamer sank. The hands
had stopped at three minutes after. 5
o'clock. Lupp said the watch of Captain
Swan, another survivor, . stopped . about
the same time. \:f?
Saw Hole in Walla Walla.
Peter Nelson, first officer of the Walla
Walla, made the following statement::
"I was In bed asleep at the time of the
collision. I heard a crash and immedi
ately jumped out on deck- to see' what
was the matter. I saw a big hole in the
Walla Walla's side and , saw ; the , water
rushing into the ship.' I found*. the crew
rushing about on deck and ordered them
to their stations at the boats. We start
ed immediately to hoist out and lower
the boats and life rafts. As we'. were Iow 7
ering the boats I saw a' flare of . light
astern.
"I at once ordered No. 7 boat, which
was all . rea<5y to leave . the 'ship, to* pro
ceed to the light, land the passengers
and come back to the ship. We were en
deavoring to get out Nos. 9 and 10 boats

LONDON, Jan. 1Lâ The manager of one
of the largest trans-Atlantic lines was
asked by* a Call correspondent to-day if
he expected an unusual number of Amer
icans to be present in London at' the time
of the coronation of King Edward. He
said:
"No. By "May I fear we shall have such
a smallpox scare and epidemic that Lon
don will be in quarantine when King Ed
ward is crowned."
That this is by no means a' pessimistic
forecast is evidenced by the fact that tho
line referred to began this week to hava
the crews of its ships vaccinated prior to
leaving London for New York. Other lines
are following its example, fearing ' that
any day the American authorities may
place London shipping under an embargo
on account of smallpox. The vaccination
of the crews is only a preliminary to the
same operation in the- case of passengers,
tbe English shipping firms or agent* hav
ing no desire to undergo the. financial loss
which would be involved yby the detention
of vessels having on. board unvaccinated
passengers or crews. In this respect the
shipping interests are ahead of the United
States Consulate, which up to the present
has taken no steps to protect health at
the home ports.
Alarming Precautions.
On all sides in the United Kingdom
alarming precautions are on foot to deal
with the outbreak. The total of smallpox
cases in London now amounts to only
about 900, but the cases are so scattered
that they create the greatest anxiety.
Medical men point out that the danger
lies 'not so much in the proportion to the
population as In the proportion to the
usual smallpox figures of the metropolis,
which generally scarcely amount to a
score per annum. i
London's laboratories are all phenome
nally busy in turning out lymph, thou
sands of tubes of which are dally sup
plied, but even so the demand cannot be
met. Almost all of the large firms are
ordering their employes to be vaccinated.
Corporations are appropriating sums for
the erection of smallpox additions to the
hospitals, while several -steamers . have
been purchased in London for the accom
modation- of the present and expected pa
tients. Expert opinion prophesies that
the epidemic will not reach its height un
til May. The effect of such a condition of
things on the coronation, international
business and English trade ia almost in
calculable.
Seamen Not in Danger.
NEW .YORK, Jan. 11.â In steamship cir
cles the opinion was freely expressed to
day that the report from London regard
ing the fear of an epidemic of smallpox
there during the coming spring and sum
mer is. exaggerated. So far as steamship
crews are concerned no apprehension .is
felt. Smallpox, it was said, is exceedingly
rare among the sailors of the trans-Atlan
tic lines, because it is the regular custom
to have ail members of the crews vacci
nated before they are allowed. to enter
upon their duties on board the steamers.

LONDON. Jan.- 11.â The British "War
Office I is confronted with a most serious
condition of affairs. Its calls for volun
teers to relieve tho regiments at the front
have so far met with absolutely no re
sponse and have served to intensify the
widespread Indignation existing among all
the volunteer regiments.
In : the first place volunteers answering
the call would only receive a shilling a
day, while the yeomanry, in which many
volunteers have already enlisted, receive
5 shillings a day. The only solution for
the deadlock appears to be for the War
Office to introduce conscription or with
draw: the new .regulations. These have
stirred up strife to an extent which has
not existed for many a year between the
Government officials and the volunteer
arm of the service and, according to many
high officials,' will bankrupt a majority of
the regiments.- ' â¢ â¢
According to the new rules every regi
ment must go into camp for one week
each year and the Government grant will
be. reduced; In proportion t to the number
of absentees from the company. The vol
unteer* commanders â¢ say it Is impossible
to get more than 40 per cent of the men
together tha same week, so< different' are
the occupations of the volunteers. In ad
dition the -War Office refused|to recognize
drills which are not attended by a per
centage of men which It , has hitherto
been found quite impossible to attain and

MRS. W.- B. KRAUSE.
A great many remedies .for temporary

me. such as sprays, snuffs, creams and
ther local applications, but, as a rule,
tie medical profession has little or no
enthusiasm in the treatment of catarrh.
:t.Â»ls generally pronounced by them to be
nicurable. It therefore created a great
sensation in medical circles when Dr.
Hartman \ announced that he had de-
vised a. compound which would cure ca-
tarrh permanently. ThÂ© remedy was
named Pe-ru-na, and In a short time be-
came known to thousands of catarrh suf-
ferers North, South, East and West.
â¢ Letters testifying to the fact that Pe-
runa is a radical cure for catarrh began
to . pour in from all directions. Thou-
sands of such letters are on file In the
office of the Pe-ru-na Medicine Company.
These letters are not used for publication
except by the- express wish of the writer.
A pamphlet filled with such letters will
be sent to any address free. .This book
should be read by all who doubt the curt
ability of catarrh.
* If you do not receive prompt and aatls-.
factory results from the use of Peruna,'
write at once to Dr. Hartman. giving a
full statement of your case, and ha win
be pleased to give you his valuable ad-,

Mr. J. Orpe, corner Twenty-seventh and
Market streets, Galveston. Texas, writes:
"I was afflicted with a case of chronic
catarrh of twenty years' standing:. I had
been partially deaf on the j left side for
twelve years. Six months ago I had to be
propped up In bed at night and He on my
side for fear of choking. I did not think
I could be cured. I began taking Peruna,
however, and now believe myself perfect-
ly cured. My breathing is thoroughly
free and easy, and I cannot too highly
recommend your remedies." J. ORPE.
Hon. John V. "Wright, Law Depart-
ment, General Land Office of Tennessee,
In a letter written from Washlngrton, D.

lowing of Peru-
na for catarrh:
"I have used Pe-
runa in my fam-
ily and. can cheer-
fully recommend
it as being all
you represent and
wish . every one
who is suffering
with catarrh,

could know of it.
I would advise all
such to take It in

the terrible con-
sequences. I re-
gard it as a most

inraend it" . - JOHN V. WRIGHT

"I think I would have been dead long

THE Pacific Coast, and especially
California, may be congratulated
on the personnel of the board of
trustees chosen by Andrew Carne
gie to direct the affairs of the
Carnegie Institution at Washington,, for
which the steel magnate has just given
$10,000,000. President Daniel C. Gllman, one
of the trustees and Mr. Carnegie's most
trusted adviser on matters pertaining to
this foundation, is in sympathy with Cali
fornia thought and interests, having been
president of the University of California
before he went East to make Johns Hop
kins great. D. O. Mills, though accred
ited to New York in the geographical
distribution of the trusteeships, knows
California and her people. '.
The particular representative of the
coast, however, is Judge W. W. Morrow
of the United States Circuit Court. The.
appointment was an eminently fitting one
as well as a marked honor to California
and to the appointee. Judge Morrow a
judicial duties brings him into close touch
with the people of all the vast territory
of his circuit, which includes California,
(Oregon," Washington, Nevada, Arizona,
Alaska and the Hawaiian Islands. In his
travels from city to city where the Circuit
Court convenes he meets the leaders of
the bar, prominent educators and the men
who are advancing the material prosper
ity of the Pacific Coast States. Few men
would have so good an opportunity as he
to become truly representative of - this
western empire on the board of trustees
of the new institution of learning.
Judge Morrow Makes Reply.
Judge Morrow received' Mr. Carnegie's
Invitation to become a trustee of the Car
negie Institution two weeks ago.. He re
plied that he was In hearty, sympathy
with the purposes of the proposed, founda
tion and felt honored by appointment to
the I board of trustees. He formally ac
cepted and pledged himself to give every
service required of him to advance the
interests of the institution.
The reply of Judge Morrow was prob
ably the, last to reach Mr. Carnegie, on
account of the distance, for immediately
upon Its receipt last Wednesday Mr. Car-
Patrick Ryan Disappears.
Patrick ; Ryan, employed as '. a guard at
the Spring Valley Water Company's res
ervoir near the. Almshouse, disappeared
yesterday. His hat and coat were found
near the reservoir and it is feared .that
he fell In ' and was drowned. } Ryan was
about 50 years of age and had a family re
siding at 411 Clementina street.
â¢Â»â¢ ; : ; â

The men chosen by the philanthropist to
direct the affairs of the institution repre
sent a remarkable diversity of walks in
life and a careful geographical distribu
tion. There is an eminent educator, a
diplomat, a Senator, a Supreme Court
Justice, a Circuit Judge, a great surgeon,
men great in various. departments of In
dustry, and so on through the list, with
scarcely two men whose lives Â¦ have fol
lowed similar channels. The eminence of
the men selected' gives guarantee of "able
management. Mutual acquaintance, also,
will insure the early attainment of har
monious action in the board itself. ..

WASHINGTON, Jan. 11â The effect of
wireless telegraphy on the future of the
submarine cable was developed to some
extent to-day by the House Committee
on Commerce in connection with the
hearing on the proposed Pacific cable.
The hearing was largely attended."
Vice President Ward of the Pacific Ca
ble Company continued his statement of
yesterday. He said he believed that the
company he represented would be able io
make exclusive traffic arrangements from
points beyond the Philippines and con
necting with China and Japan. He main
tained that while there was no purpose to
set up a monopoly, yet it was likely his
company would have exclusive traffic ar
rangements with the Far Kast. He also
stated that there would be Questions us
to the rignt of. the United States to land
a cable on foreign shores.
Representative atewart of New Jersey
Interposed tne statement that Germany's
present course against Venezuela snowed.
mat the German Government made little
distinction between imuiic anu private
rights, so that a Government cabie sta
tion wouia iiave about tne same status
tus a private station.
' cuuiima.u hepuurn asked a series of
questions us to tne effect of wireless tei
tgrajjiiy on the submarine cable. Ward,
replica that tne new system presented a
serious question., he .was not sure tnat
tne ir'acluc cabie project would have been
undertaKen it the lung-distance experi
ments had been held earner, as to the
claims tnat. wire less signals had been con
veyed 2uuO miles across the Atlantic, Ward
sau that if tne claims were mauÂ« good
tney would deter people irom laying any
more cables. When asked as to tne et
lect thus tar on the cable business, Ward
said it had depressed cable interests.-
Stewart wanted to know If tne "cable
companies had not chaseu Marconi out
Oi. Canada," to Â«*Â»Â«-Â». Ward answered
that he believed the cable companies had
insisted upon certain exclusive rlgnts
tney held.
James Foord stated that the Asiatic As
sociation, doing business in tne Orient,
lavored private control. It was opposed
to the Government entering the field of
private enterprise. President Scrymser
of the South and Central American cable
system made an extended argument fa
vorable to Government control of the Pa
cilic cable, citing incidents of the Span
ish-American war showing the impor
tance of governmental control of the ca
ble. In one case cited the Spanish Min
ister of Marine cabled Admiral Cervera
to leave Santiago. If this dispatch had
not been intercepted, Scrymser said, the
battle of Santiago Bay would not have
been fought and the conduct of the war
might have been changed. -
Thomas E. Hughes, representing an
American company which produces cable,
stated that as good cables could be made
in the United States as in any other part
of the world, and he asked that American.
labor and capital have the advantage of
doing this work. Chairman Hepburn
asked If this American company was pre
pared to make a definite business propo
sition to the United States Government.
Hughes replied that such a proposition
would be submitted in due form within
the next two days. Hepburn asked that
the formal proposition be in alternative
formâ first, for delivering a . cable â¢ of
American make at San Francisco; second,
for making and laying the cable to Ha
waii, Guam and Manila. Hughes thought
the Government better able to do its own
cable-laying, using the artay transports.
As indicating the general character of
the forthcoming proposition, Hughes said
the cost would be within 10 per cent of
that stated as the cost of the Pacific
Commercial Company's cable. The addi
tional 10 per cent, he stated, was for the
protection of American industry

iTrank Holt, a trusty at Alcatraz, serv
ing thirteen years for desertion,; cleverly
escaped from; the island yesterday morn
ing in a large : wooden box. , Edward P.
Timmons, .who was released from Alca
traz about the time that Holt escaped, is
being detained by the local police as an
accomplice. '-_.,\ / . " : ,
To accomplish his. escape. Holt Xorged
, the. name of Charles Zuschlag, a private
in charge of the stables, to an order for
the removal of the box in which he con
cealed himself . to the Government boat
McDowell, 'which was lying alongside the
Island. It is thought that after the box
was placed aboard the boat Holt crawled
into it and did not emerge from his place
of concealment until the vessel neared the
Clay-street wharf. .
As he was dressed in a soldier's uni
form he ' experienced no difficulty in
anghting ' from - the boat along with a
number of soldiers : who j were on a visit
to this city.- .
The box in which Holt made his escape
was made of boards picked up about the
island. The top was so- arranged with
leather : straps : that It â¢ could be opened
from the Inside. To preclude the possi
bility . of detection Holt printed the name
of S. N. Wood & Co., well known cloth
iers, Market street, on. the top of the box.
Thinking it was consigned to Wo6d,&
Co., the corporal who was . supervising
the loading of .the boat allowed It to pass
without ' making an investigation. :
Â¦ Shortly after the McDowell left the isl
and the prisoners were lined up and
counted, And as one, who proved to be
Holt, was" missing : a thorough search for
him was made. It was not until the boat
returned to the island and , the empty
box examined that the manner of Holt's
escape from the military prison was dis
covered. Word was at once sent to Cap
tain Seymour,' who - detailed Detectives
Hammill and Crockett to find the escaped
prisoner. . Accompanied by Private
Zuschlag and Corporal Frazier the de
tectives â¢ searched a number of water
front resorts, but without getting a clew
to Holt's whereabouts. Tlmmons, who is
believed ; to be Holt's accomplice, ' was
found, however, and taken to. police head
quarters. Â¦%. When questioned he at first
denied that he was aware that Holt had
escaped. | but \ finally admitted that ' he
knew he had' â¢ concealed himself in" the
box before the McDowell left Alcatraz.
Â¦ "I did . not want to inform anybody of
his escape," he remarked,' "and for that
reason I. kept my mouth shut. I did not
see him after we left the island." If he
managed to get away I don't know any

Condor, which sailed from j Bsquimalt for
Honolulu and the south on December 2 is
overdue - at . Honolulu. There are, grave
fears for the safety of the warship, which)
must have encountered the heavy storma
that caused such damage to Pacific Coast'
shipping in the past six weeks.; She left
in company with -the WarBplte, the flag
ship of this station, and the collier Mat
teawan, which sailed on the same day
from Nanaimo with 4890 tons of coal. The
Warspite reached San Diego on schedule
time, but nothing has since been heard of
either, the Matteawan or the Condor.
The naval' officials at Esquimalt are
considerably worried over the Condor's
non-arrival at the Islands. She had not
been heard of when the last mall advices
were received via San Francisco on Jan
uary 3, and if no word is received by the
Bteamer Moana, which is to leave the

rapidly got ready; will leave for the south
to seek, information regarding the miss
ing vessel. _ . . ' -
| The â¢ explanation for her non-arrival
given at Esquimau Is that she has prob
ably run short of coal and has made the
voyage to . Honolulu under sail. Even if
this be the case, she should have made
the passage in less than thirty-two days
and should have arrived under sail before
January . 3, as the bark Hesper, which

and passed out to sea the following day,
arrived at the island port in distress on

Ninety Per Cent of It Really
Caused From Poor Digestion.
Real organic heart trouble Is' Incurable, but
scarcely one case In a hundred is organic.
'VThe action of the heart and stomach are both
controlled by the same"great nerves, the sympa-
thetic and pneumogastrlc, and when the stom-
ach fails to properly digest, the food and It lies
in the stomach fermenting, gases are formed
which distend the organ, causing pressure on
the heart and lungs, . causing .- palpitation. Ir-
regularity and shortness of breath.
The danger from this condition Is that the
continued disturbance of the heart* sooner or
later may cause real organic heart trouble and
in fact frequently does so.
Â¦ Furthermore, poor digestion makes the blood
thin and watery and deficient in red corpuscles,
and this further irritates and Â¦ weakens the
heart. --<... , . â¢â¢ .- - >
. The most sensible, thing ; to do for heart
trouble is to Insure the digestion and assimila-
tion of the food. . ' . . . ; Â¦..
1 This can be done by the . regular use after
meals of some safe, pleasant and effective di-
gestive . preparation, < like Stuart's , Dyspepsia
Tablets, which may be found at most drug
stores and ; which contain the necessary diges-
tive elements in a pleasant,. convenient form.-
..Thousands of people keep. well and vigorous
by keeping their digestion perfect by observing
the rule of taking one or two of these tablets
after each meal, or at least after, each hearty
meal. , 'Â¦ . Â¦Â¦ ' .â¢'Â¦"Â¦ V. 'Â¦'-'.->..--Â¦Â¦.
Stuart' s Dyspepsia Tablets contain U. S. : P. i
pepsin. â¢ diastase â¢ from Â¦ malt and other natural I
digestives which act only on the food, digesting
It perfectly and preventing acidity, Rases and

OMAHA, Neb., Jan. 11.â The ' plan of
railroad campaigning to/be -carried, out
by the Union Pacific road during .1902 was
given out officially, to-day, and. will result
in" the expenditure of from . $25,000,000 to
$30,000,000 ln ; improvements "and extensions.
It, is a continuance of the general plan
of putting the road in. the best ' possible
condition between Omaha and San Fran

rected almost to that part of th 3
road west of Salt Lake and Ogden and the

The primed object, it Is said.- Is to put
the road ln a position to control the im
mense trade with the Orient that is ex

ln tho EaBt and Hawaii. This trade is al
ready beginning -to, reach formidable .pro
portions, and .the. Union Pacific, it is
stated, is preparing to meet the,competi
tion of the' northern lines. That part of
the road between Omaha and Ogdeni has
been put in prime condition by the ex

improvements - annually, for the past ; tlve

has been used In straightening crooks ami

WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.â There Is au
thority,--for the statement that Secretary
Root* is strongly opposed to commercial
reciprocity between the United States and
the Philippines on the general ground
that any such arrangement would be de
structive of the . "open door" policy of
this Government in the East. It is argued
that the United States only secured the
open door ln China after patient and as
siduous diplomatic negotiations with,
other foreign governments concerned, and
to now deny to other governments the
same trade facilities with the Philippines
enjoyed by the United States would re
sult in closing the principal markets ln
China to the United^ States. -^
Speaking on this subject to-day, a Cab
inet officer said Â¦ that the only way the
United States could be treated the same
as Russia, France, Germany and Great
Britain in -the Chinese provinces" now in
the possession of these governments
[would be by granting the countries
named equal privileges and facilities
with the United States for trade with the
Philippines. The above statements repre
sent the position of Secretary Root on
the general question of. trade relations
with the Philippines, and the conclusion
is that President: Roosevelt holds similar
views. ;> '-.,-. , â¢ '

day. Mpyor Collins gava a luncheon in

bridge this afternoon both Democratic
and non-partisan citizens thronged the-
City Hall to welcome Bryan, who held a
public reception there with the Demo
cratic Mayor. John, H. H. McNamee, by
his side. Members of the City Council
first shook hands with Bryan, and. then
the public. At the conclusion of the cere
monies Bryan was driven to the home of
Mayor McNamee to be the Mayor's guest
at dinner.
To-night 2000 people crowded Sander'/i
Theater, Cambridge, to hear Bryan ao
dress the students of Harvard University.
He entered, accompanied by Mayor Mc-
Namee and several members of the City
Council. When he rose to speak he was
greeted Â¦with enthusiastic and prolonged
applause. The subject of the address was
"A. Conquering Nation." The audience
was cordial throughout and demonstrative
at times. Almost every one remained un
til the conclusion of the speech, an un
usual thing for Harvard students when
assembled ln such large numbers. The
speaker's remarks on trusts and taxation
were received with hearty applause, and
his attack on Imperialism, caused the
greatest enthusiasm.

how to join, and I hope that means will
be found to bring more young men In.
The people who left us ' for . reasons of

ceived from the Republican party. I
think it is your duty to strengthen your
selves and to stand on principles, not on
patronage. . You know. this organization
generally polls the largest vote when it
has Tio patronage. I have been in thS
organization . thirty-five years, and dur
ing that period it has polled a larger vote
proportionately in years when It had- no
patronage. So " you need- never fear the
efforts of men who leave us because they
wi3h to 'get positions. It Is neglect N of
yourselves and 'distrust of your leaders
which will hurt you. If you conduct this

receive the. same consideration and good
will which had been extended to himself.
He added: . . -_
, In announcing the name of Nixon for
the chairmanship of the finance commit
tee George M.; Van Iloesen; president of
the general .committee, said that the step
was taken at the desire of > Croker him
self. Croker, however, did not express
himself until all the business -before the

May 30, but his questions were objected
to' and the objection sustained by Judge
Harrington, who said: - ,
"We do not propose to allow you to go
over the same ground day after day. This
ground has all been gone over, and I in
struct the counsel not to go over actions
of witness previous to supper time on
May 30."
t Raker asked in emphatic and appcalirg
language Â»f or the Judge to. ; hear him.
Spencer interposed here to say that the
ground had already been gone over for
the prosecution and every latitude given
Post. , ' - r. <
Hutton told of his visit to Trowbridge's
store on the morning of the lynching to
prepare ropes for the lynching, the meet
ing having . been arranged previously.
Himself, Claude Brown, Fred Roberts and
K. S. Trowbridge were present. They ad
journed . to- a' shed and Â¦ tested the ropes,
Judge Myers agreeing to try to tie a
hangman's knot. ;*"â¢Â¦. . .
The court admonished Raker., several
times to conduct himself properly In
framing his questions.. Raker said the
defense, wanted the whole truth, and the
court replied that it did not seem to want
the truth." Raker again asked for a tran
script of the stenographer's notes to prove
that he wanted to get at the facts. Judge
Harrington said that If Raker attempted
to ask for notes again he would send him
to, jail for, contempt. Raker .replied that
his ..Honor was hampering the case and
instructing him in such a manner that he
could not get- at the facts. The Judge
again: reproved counsel for the defense
for their dilatory methods in conducting
theT examination and declared a recess,
not, however, until Raker requested > thai
Hutton be placed in care of the. Sheriff,
which request was .denied as unlawful.
The court admonished the jury to keep
its own counsel. Â¦ c Â¦ '
Myers Tied the Knot. ;f,^.
The courtroom was unusually crowded
when the examination of Witness Hutton "
was resumed in the afternoon. . The wit
ness, after much Interruption, finally
said that Judge Myers tied all the knots
and that Storekeeper Trowbridge cut the
rope into the required lengths. ' :
The method of- questioning followed by.
the defense â¢â¢ angered Judge i Harrington,
who reprimanded Raker.
Some of the party, continued - Hutton,
adjourned to Myers' hotel after the meet
ing 'and had drinks. - Raker- attempted to
fix the time of the party leaving the bar
room, and framed his interrogations in
such a manner as to call for a condemna
tion from the court, Â¦ who told Raker he
was going beyond the limit prescribed by
law in his conduct of the examination.
"Can't v l get the-.truth, your Honor?"
asked Raker. "I beg of you not to shut
the door." . * " _ ; '
It finally, was i brought out that the
party left : ihe saloon> shortly afj;er 10
o'clock, Hutton seating himself on the
porch, facing, the north road. He was
asked if he saw defendant Brown going
toward his house and replied in the affir
mative, but said that he did , not see
Brown Â¦ again between -that time and the
dinner hour. Hutton was asked if there
was any. obstruction in the road between
the olacc where he was sitting and the
barn. "
Sturtevant, for .the prosecution, here
arose 'and protested against going into
such minute details and asserted that the
method of examination, conducted as it
had been, was for the purpose of contro
verting other witnesses. Raker asked if
there was anything unreasonable in en
tering into such details and said that his
purpose was to test the 1 memory" of the
witness. Judge Harrington declared he
would stop Raker's interrogations of the
witness unless he changed his 'tactics.
Invited to the Lynching BeÂ«.
Hutton then told of the conversation he
had with JerverKresge on the afternoon
of May 27 or 28 near the barn. Questions
were so framed by Raker as to call for
numerous objections, and finally the court
propounded, in revised form, several of
Hakar's questions to the'Witness,-repri
manding Raker and saying that Raker
did not desire the full facts in the case.
Hutton' said that Kresge told him of the
plan to: hang certain persons,- explaining
that the law had failed in its purpose and
that lie and others were taking matters in
their ownhands. " ...-'.>.â¢'.Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦
, In answer* to a question, Hutton said
that' he had been spoken to before regard
ing the lynching. James W. ' Brown â¢ had
called him. from the. hotel the day before
and Invited him to join the mob. Here the
Judge asked several questions, saying to
Raker: Â¦": 'â¢' 'â¢:Â¦Â¦- Â¦: "Â¦ \ Â¦ - - - ' -Â¦
"You 1 are trying to tangle and' mislead
the witness* -* That is the reason I take up
the examination at times. ,You are pursu
ing an. unwarranted -course as a lawyer.'
Your methods are objectionable, incorrigi
ble and irascible." ,r
This remark of the Judge was called
forth, by- a statement Raker that the
witness had Â¦ sworn differently, befdre: the
Grand ' Jury.1fta*ast^ < SÂ»i)3Ba*fafJ^*yiÂ»JBSag*"'
- Raker asked by what route. Hutton and
Brown -had. reached the point behind the
hotel. where their conversation had taken
place.. This was objected to and the ob
jection sustained,' the court characterizing
Raker as , ah "obstructf onist,". and warn
ing him that if he asked the same question
again he would , order .-.the * witness : from
the â¢ stand." : Raker % reframed the : question
and the court became , very angry,- order
ing Hutton from the 1 stand: until Raker
."cooled down and acted as* a gentleman

At a previous examination young Hut
ton had sworn that he had gone to bed
on the night of May 30 after seeing Claude
Morris to bed, but to-day- ho said that ho
and Morris had sat on the *porch until
late, in the. night .Raker asked him If
he had not told other persons that he had
gone to bed. and this question was ob-
Jected^ to. Raker. said that he wanted
only the truth, and ' he and Post. had,
"If you do not keep within the ethics of
the law and act like a gentleman I will
put you out. of this case."
Raker replied, saying. "These men."
referring to thÂ© counsel of the prosecu
tion, "howl every time I ask a Question."
The court replied that Raker was doing
all the howling. *','-;>;,
Hutton then told something of the hap
penings of the night of the lynching. He
said that after supper in the hotel Judge
Myers, Samuel Parks, Claude Morris and
one or two others went into Trowbridge'a
store. Here the cross-examination by
.uaKer again became objectionable to the
prosecution and Judge Harrington finally
exclaimed to Raker:
Raker retorted that when the defense
was out of ammunition he wquld let the
court know it. Judge Harrington replied
that the counsel for the defense was sim
ply working with the view of having the
court set the witness aside. .
"I think you are out of ammunition."
tions had been asked and answered be
fore. ' The objection" was sustained by the
court, who remarked to the defense:
words as to one another's truth-telllngr
qualifications. Finally the court inter
fered, sayinc:
"I am tired, debilitated and prostrated
from this siege, and I will order recess
until Monday morning at 10:30." *\ .

Spencer Takes a Hand.
Hutton told of visiting Myers* Hotel and
having supper . with , Tetreau, Myers;
Parks and . Supervisor Dennis i Kane.
Counsel for the prosecution again ob
jected and Raker hotly asserted that Gen
eral Post was trying to educate the wit
ness. , Raker repeated this remark several
times during the' morning- session, and
asked' the* court : to order the witness to
face the Jury. The court replied .that a
man with eyes could do. what he wanted
with them. Post called to the attention
of Raker the fact that 'his (Post's) back
was turned on the witness. -
Hutton said that, after leaving Tr'ow
bridge's store, he went 'to a blacksmith
shop with J. J. Potter, and Joe Leventon;
They < met Frank J. Tetreau there.
The witness, after many objections, was
permitted to answer several questions put
to him by counsel for the defense, but
only after they had been reframed by the
court, who objected ;to the manner in
which the. questions were formed. â¢:
"If you did not ask them it was because
you avoided the opportunity intention
ally." . . > : - - ..Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦ Â¦.'-.'. Â¦Â¦Â¦-..; .
The defense then took up the cross-ex
amination where It had left off on Thurs
day. Hutton said that he .was in Trow
bridge's store on the afternoon of May 30
with J. J. Potter and Joe Leventon. Much
.time was lost by reason of objections, the
prosecution claiming that the ground had
been already gone over., many times and
that a desire for delay prompted the
method of cross-examination 'by the Â¦Â¦ de
fense. Most of the objections of the pros
ecution were sustained by the court. Ra
ker asked if the court denied him the
right to obtain the complete facts of the
case.' The court replied that he did not/
but- that he -would not tolerate continual
reference to matters already gone over.
Raker defied that < he had ever masked
questions i regarding- doings* on the after
noon of. May 30, and his Honor said:
Court Scores the Lawyer.
Rakerthen tried another tack. â¢ He said
he wanted- to show that the witness -was
restrained of his liberty and Â¦ "was . practi
cally. In the custody of the prosecution.
He was told that he was out of order.
Judge Harrington said: -.'Â¦.â¢-Â¦
"I am not going to be bulldozed. I am
going to administer the law as I know It
and if Mr. Raker doesn't know the law
he had better study, it.'v'^:-'- Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦ Â¦ ':'â¢ Â¦
Raker replied that the prosecution was
trying in every way to throttle Justice.
The defense endeavored to bring out that
Hutton had been .kept under surveillance
by | the prosecution and ! that he Â¦' was Â¦ ac
companied , by ; Daniel Miller on his jour
neys to and from : the I Courthouse and
when on the streets at other times.- Thia
method of examination was strongly ob
jected to by, the prosecution and the ob
jection was sustained by the court. .Raker,
asked if the' court would "Issue an order
for Hutton to be permitted. to walk down
the street In his (Raker's) company and
Â¦ be Â¦ accompanied 'by.pSherlnT '.Street. j-The
court denied the request emphatically, but
said he would allow a question as to who
accompanied Hutton 1 to â¢ the '* courtroom.
The; question was asked, : Hutton replying
that Miller accompanied him, ...
When proceedings opened tills morning
Raker, for.the defense, asked the court,
as he repeatedly has done before, to per
mit the stenographer, to make attranscript
of the cross-examination of Hutton for
the use. of the defense. The court re
fused, the request and said that the de
fendants had been furnished with a com
plete transcript of the direct examination,
but that full notes of the cross-examina
tion were unnecessary and a drain on, the
finances of the county.' ' -. - '. "-.. '
Baker's Opening Request.
. .ALTLRAS, Jan/ 11.â This .was the third
day. of the j cross-examination Â¦) of. John
Hutton, whose confession of the part l.e
took' in the lynching of Calvin Hall,
Frank Hall, James Hall, Daniel Yantis
and 1 . Martin Wilson, on the night of May
o0 last, created such a disturbance in the
camp of the defense. The proceedings
were constantly enlivened- by spicy bits of
repartee between Judge Harrington and
counsel for defendant, James W,. Brown.
Almost from the first minute of to-day's
proceedings bickering commenced: Most
of.it was occasioned- by the peculiar
methods of the cross-examination adopted
by Attorney Raker, for the defense, which
called forth objections, without number
from counsel for the prosecution and fre
quent reprimands of Haker by the court.
At times the quarreling disgusted the
spectators who liliea the courtroom.
Raker asks the same . questions over
again, even j after they " have ' been; an
swered in an apparently satisfactory
manner, and just so often are objections
made and usually, sustained. However,
the court to-day permitted Hutton to an
swer many of the questions, after strenu
ous objections had It**n made by Post or
his colleagues. : -^^
At one stage of the proceedings Judgo
Harrington said that such dilatory tactic3
as were pursued by Raker had never been
allowed in any courtroom in the land, and
declared that hereafter he would confine
the. examination of the witnesses within
the most. rigid bounds. - â¢
Hutton mado a good witness for. the
prosecution, though on several occasions
Kaker tangled him somewhat. Judge Har
rington appeared to be in an almost-ex
hausted condition and frequently noted
the progress of the- hands around tho
clock, rinally' declaring the court ad
journed/ as he was exhausted by what
he had- passed through- during the last
seven or eight weeks;

: PROF. THOMAS F. ADKIN.
President of the Institute of Physicians and
Surgeons.
In all parts of the country men . and women, .
doc.tors and, surgeons,/ .clergymen and educa-
tors, are wondering? at 'the remarkable cures
madÂ£ by Prof. Thomas F. Adkin, discoverer
cf the Adkin Vitaopathic . treatment.
A-of. Adkin heals .not by "drUgs, nor by
Christian Science, nor by Osteopathy, nor by
Hypnotism, nor- by Divine healing, but by a
subtle psychic force of nature in combina-
tion with certain vital " magnetic : remedies
â¢which contain the very elements of life and
health.- . â¢ .. ;;, . â¢
A reporter recently . talked with Prof. Ad-
kin and was asked to invite all readers of
this paper .who are sick or who are worried
i y the ills of ; those dear to theoi to write
to 'him for assistance. "Some people have -1e-
clared," said Prof. Adkln, "that ray .powers
are of God; they call me a-Divlne healer;, a'
man of mysterious powers.- This is not 'so. I
cure because I understand nature, because I
use tho subtle force of nature to build up the
system, and restore health. - But at the same
time I believe that the Creator would- not
have given me the. opportunity to make the
discoveries I have made or the ability to
develop them if he had not Intended that 1 1
should use them for the good of humanity.
I. therefore, feel that it is my duty to Rive
the benefit Of the science I practice to all who
are suffering. I want you to tell. your read-
ers that they can write to me. in the strict-
est confidence if they -are troubled -with -any-
kind of disease, and I will thoroughly diag-
nose their cases' and prescribe a 'simple home
treatment Â¦ which : I â¢ positively, guarantee to
effect a complete cure, 1 -- absolutely free of
charge. I 'care not I how serious their cases,
nor how hopeless they may seem, I want them
to write to me and let me make them well, I
feel that this Is my life's work."
So great is the sensation wrought la the
medical world by the wonderful cures per-
formed by Prof. Adkin that . several profes-
sional gentlemen were asked :. to .investigate
the cures. Among â¢ these gentlemen | were Dr.
L. B. Hawley and Dr. L. G. Doane, both
famous physicians ' and surgeons. After Â¦ a
thorough and painstaking investigation theso '
eminent physicians were so astounded at . the
far-reaching powers of Prof. Adkin and the
woiiderful efficacy of Vitaopathy , that .they
volunteered to forsake all other ties in life and
all other kinds of ' treatment and devote them-
selves to assisting Prof. Â» Adkin ..in [ his great
work for humanity. With the discovery of the
Adkin Vitaopathic treatment eminent physi-
cians are generally agreed that the treatment
of disease has at last been reduced to an exact
science. " , . Â¦"
Â¦ In all, some 8000 men and women have been
cured by the powers of Prof. Adkln. .Some
v. r ere blind, some were lame, some v/ere deaf.
Home were paralytics, scarcely able to move,
so great was their, infirmity. Others were
afflicted with Bright's disease, heart disease,
consumption and otheft so-called iniuirable dls-
| eases. Some were sufferers from kidney
trouble, dyspepsia, nervous debllityX Insom-
nia, neuralgia, constipation, rheumatism, fe-
. male troubles and other similar ills. Some
were men and women addicted" ' to drunken-
ness, morphine and other evil habits. In all
cases Prof. Adkin treats he guarantees a cure.
Even those on the brink of the grave, with
all hope of recovery gone and despaired of by
doctors and friends alike, have been restored
to perfect health by the force of Vitaopathy
and Prof. Adkin's marvelous skill. â¢ And re-
markable as it may seem, distance has. made
. no difference. Those living far away have been
' cured In the privacy of their own homes, aa
well as those who have been treated : in per-
son.. Prof. Adkln asserts that he can cure any
: one at any distance aa t well as though , he
stood before them. Â¦. Â¦â¢â¢.-.
. Not long ago John Adams of Blakesbury,
, Iowa, who had been lame : for twenty years,
was permanently cured by -Prof. Adkin with-"
Â¦ out an operation of any kind. About the same
> time the city of Rochester, ,N. T., , was startlec
Â¦ by the cure of one of its oldest residents, Mr. >
P. A. Wright, who had been partly blind for a
'. long period. John E. Neff of Mlllersburg, .Pa.,,
who had suffered I for years from g a cataract
over, his left eye, was speedily restored to per-
' ' feet sight without an | operation. From Logans-
> port, Ind., comes the news of the recovery of
s Mrs. Mary-. Eicher," who had been practically
deaf for a year, while In -Warren, \ Pa.; Mr. G.
W. Savage, a noted photographer , and artist,
who was not only partially blind and deaf, but
at death's door from a complication of dls*
eases, was restored to perfect health and
strength -by Prof. Adkin. . V â¢' -â -Â¦
Vitaopathy cures. not one disease alone, but
It cures ail diseases when used in comblna-
- tlon with the proper remedies. If you are elck,
' no - matter . what your disease, nor - who ' eays
, you cannot be cured; write Â¦ to Prof. " Adkin
to-day; tell him the leading ' symptoms . of
3 your complaint, how. long you have been suf-
) fering, and be will at once diagnose your case,'
- Â«tell you the exact disease from which you are
l suffering and - prescribe Â¦ the 'treatment that
s will positively cure you. 1 This will cost you ab-
> solutely nothing. Prof. Adkln will- also send you
. a copy of his marvelous new book ent;tled
3 "How- to .'.Be v Cured -.-'and' .How..- to'- -Cure

hearts together as Ismar had prophesied.
They became engaged. Their marriage
was to take place in a short- time, and It
Seemed that in this Ismar's prognostica-
tion was destined to fail, for she had said
that the month of October would -mark
the Wedding day. But it had notÂ»been
guess work with Ismar; she had read the
veiled page of destiny as one reads a
book, and she had told aright. Just as
the crowning event of love seemed dawn-
ing upon the lovers, insurmountable diffi-
culties arose and impeded their happiness
by deferring their marriage. In spite. of
all they could do, the months rolled by.
and October came, when fortune smiled
upon their compact and they were made

mar. To Miss Voeller, when she called
upon Ismar in March, the future was as
dark and doubtful as a starless night; but
tolsmaitv the seer, it was as clear as tb.3
light of noontide. ; Miss Voeller had no se-
rious thought of matrimonjrwhile she vis-
ited in San Francisco, save that, like the
average normal girl, there lingered in her
heart a subtle hope that some day somo
man might come Into her life arid claim
her as his own. But her future husband
was accurately described, even as to ap-
pearance and disposition, and she was
advised to marry him If she valued her
future happiness. She left Ismar's mys-
tical sanctum bewildered, but nursing a
new-born hope. Shortly afterward she re-

Ismar's wonderful, power to penetrat*
the future and foresee events is grfven ad-
ditional strength by reason of her thor-
ough knowledge of tho sciences peculiar
to the people of the Orient, where she was
born and amons whom she lived for many
years. ,
Those who are worried and melancholy
she sets at rest by disclosing the means
of 'avoiding Impending disasters and re-
verses; she shows bow success can be at-
tained, no matter what present conditions
may be; gives Invaluable counsel in busi-
ness or speculation so as to Insure suc-
cess. In affairs of the heart she Is abl<>
to revcai the proper course to pursue, and
her foreknowledge and advice have been
the means of making thousands of young
people happy during the past few years.
Many of the best and most prominent peo-
ple, both in business, society and politics.
have added new successes to their names
by consulting her before attempting some
contemplated move.
What Ismar has done for others ihe Is

above seems almost startling to the aver-

PERSONAL MENTION.^
Governor Crane has suggested to the Massachusetts Legislature; that the public docu
ments published every year are too voluminous and too costly : - for their worth, and recommends
that an editor be appointed to cut down the: bulky reports and condense them before printing.
The recommendation is one that other Governors' mightput on file, for future use. There is
hardly a State in the Union that does not waste money in printing reports that could be easily

Gabriele D'Annunzio's tragedy, "Fran
, cesca da Rimini." produced at the Teatro
Costanzl, Rome. December 9, with some
success, has been prohibited by the
Roman censor on the ground of Immor
ality. The New Tork Times says of thÂ»
production:
The event had been, eagerly awaited by til*
literary and artlstlo world of Roma, and thÂ»
house was crowded. The reception accorded
to the play was of a mixed character. Som*
scenes were applauded, but the genaral opin
ion of the critics was that thÂ» production. If
not a failure, was far from being th* creat
success that had been anticipated.
The Ieadlne poles were taken by SIxnora
Eleanora Duse and Signor Salvmt. and thw
waa little but praise tot their work. The play
was superbly staged, under tne personal super
vision of D'Annuniie.
S A recent dispatch from Rome stated that
"Francesca da Rimini" would be produced In
this country next year, with Duae and Salvial

POPULAR ACTOR WHO IS DE
LIGHTING THEATER-GOERS
AT THE ALCAZAR.
EXPERIMENTS, were recently made in -New York with- a newly invented system of clos
ing bulkhead doors in ships by hydraulic power, and according. to the reports that come
to us the result' of the test- gives promise that the adoption of the system will render
ships well nigh unsinkable by collisions or any other accident at sea. . .<"Â¦ r .1, '
The experiments were made upon the steamer Kronprinz Wilhelm of the North German
Lloyd, and it is said that company has obtained from the inventor,. Herr- Doerr, the exclu
sive control of the invention. It is claimed that by the new system the bulkhead doors, can be
closed at will from the. bridge within a minute. In the tests made ,they were closed in one minute
and a half by the simple operation of a lever from the officers'- bridge. Â¦ y
As applied upon the Kronprinz the patent doors were fitted into the bulkheads of the two
â¢j lower decks, and^ formed the entrance and exit -into thirty-four .compartments. The two decks
v thus protected are below the water line and extend completely fore and aft. They thus comprise
what may be called the vital part of the ship, being that part which is liable to be filled by the
inrushing sea in case of a collision, that would break through the hull. The doors of the apart
ments of the upper decks are operated by hand.
In describing the system the New York Mail and Express says: "By means of an electric
circuit which gives warning to the workmen of each compartment of the intention of those
in 'charge of the bridge to/close the bulkhead doors, a period of about thirty seconds is
afforded to the ship's hands to leave a compartment by getting through under the door. The lat
ter weighs about 1200 pounds, and even if the hydraulics did riot achieve their purpose it would
be possible for the door ; to descend properly into' place through its weight alone." f
The doors do not affect in any way the movements of passengers on the Upper decks. The
bulkheads are so arranged as to; give special security to the compartments (ontaining engines and
boilers, arid it is so provided: that in the event of any member of the engineering or other depart
ments getting caught in a water-tight compartment after the" doors are closed escape could be had
to the upper deck by means of a stationary ladder. .
For the purpose of operating the mechanism there is a table in the wheelhouse that vindi
cates the time that each compartment- doo<- closer Each door is numbered, and . as it closes an
electric bulb flashes a bright light. The doors are worked on a cog. turned by means of a piston
which forces each into position. It is raid that shipping men who watched the experiments regard
the invention as the most important yet made for providing safety on the sea.
Here trien is a promise that such accidents as that which wrecked" the .^VValla Walla will no
longer.be so destructive of life. Had that ill-fated' ship been provided with' such a system of
water-tight compartments separated by doors which could, be so easily 'dropped into place at a
minute's notice, the -ship would have in safety even\after the accident that happened to
her. In fact it is said that if as many as four separate compartments of the Kronprinz were now
to be filled by the sea, ; the ship would still be free from danger, of: sinking. The invention there
fore merits the attention of ship-builders and ship 7 owners; and; if it be found to realize all that is
claimed for it its adoption should.be general. i - â¢Â¦; / , v -
f I 1 HE second symphony concert has
| come and gone, and the friends of
Â£ symphony are happy. Friday
H afternoon's concert was nothing
less than extraordinary in its ad
vance-over the first concert of
: the series, and if anything like the same
; rate of progress is kept up we shall have
a Thomas orchestra inside of a twelve
month! Not quite that, perhaps, but the
: v.-ork done ' at the concert shows that
. leader and men are working on safe lines,
: That there is ample confidence and sym
â¢ pathy on both sides, and a rapidly grow
ing enthusiasm and esprit de corps. The
audience did nobly, too. There were many
. more "people in attendance and it was a
' more intent and appreciative audience
; than that which greeted the first concert.
â¢ The programme was listened to with com
Â¦ rnenduble attention until Its last note, and
the applause that followed every nuralwr.
; even to a hearty round after the finale
of the symphony, eloquently testified to
the enjoyment felt by the audience.
Truly, it was a programme to arouse
enthusiasm, with the splendid C minor
symphony of Beethoven, the delicate
sparkle of the "Midsummer Night's
Dream" Scherzo, the Lassen "Fest"
overture. and the Wagner-W^lhelmj
"Prize Song." But it was not alone the
inherent beauty of the numbers, but the
very real improvement in the work of the
'â¢rehestra that compelled recognition, the
r,ain in spirit, poise, color, and-that very
vague but very real quantity we call mag
netism. In the Beethoven symphony this
was particularly to be noted. The sym
phony "went itself" in places, drawing
orchestra, leader and audience under that
irresistible rhythmic spell in which man
touches the pulse of the infinite.
The scherzo was wonderfully well given
and ha* evidently Deceived . very careful
and thorough rehearsal. ' The opening
movement and finale was also admirably
conceived ar.d carried out. The andante
was less pleasing. Though seemingly
taken up at about metronome time, it lag
ped considerably at the beginning and in
stead cf being leisurely became * lazy.
There is no reason why the tempo should
not be just the infinitesimal shade quick
er (though it was hardly speed but im
pulse that was wanting at the opening),
to slow down later when the double
basses begin climbing up and down stairs.
Of course there was much to cavil at if
one had a mind that way, but the good so
far outweighs the deficiencies, and the
sincerity and earnestness of purpose both
of leader and men so surely promise their
conquering, that they may reasonably be
left unchronided. It is a privilege of no
mean moment to watch the growth of an
orchestra and 'twill be a pleasant tale
for the pioneers to tell some day when the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra shall
lead the way in the symphonic proces
sion. *

FAMOUS GRAND OPERA SINGER
WHO WILL, APPEAR IN THIS
CITY DURING NEXT MONTH.
WJ. HENDERSON, the New
Tork Times critic, has a pret
ty slap at San Francisco In a
recent article on Calve's Car
â¢ men. I don't mind quoting,
as I. am not among the guilty. It is of
Mme. Calve's appearance on December 30
at the Metropolitan Opera-house that Mr.
Henderson is speaking:
In San Francisco, for Instance, it _ was
promptly discovered that Mme.' Calve's Carmen
was altogether too chaste. The real thing was
the Carmen of Miss Zelie de Lussan. This
extraordinary discovery waa followed by the
collapse of Mme. Calve. She caught a serious
cold, which developed into acute bronchitis.
She had to leave the company and go to Los
Angeles to recuperate. The "glorious climate
of California" failed to work a cure, and she
departed for Florida. That also failed, and
Mme. Calve hastened to Lakewood. Thence It
was- not far to New Tork, and in this famous
sanitarium . for bronchial troubles* Mme. Calve
recovered and was able to sing Carmen last
night.
.-, The question naturally arises whether., any
thing has happened to this Carmen . that' San
Francisco .found "the^falr. the chaste, the. un-'
expressive."* 1 . 'If- we -are "to -believe what our
"Western cousins discovered, our. familiar Car
men Is the cousin, if not the - very sister of
Diana, panoplied In virtue' and treading Â¦ the
arrowy path of rectitude.- On the other hand
the Carmen of Miss do Lussan has always been
riotous of blood, incontinent in thought and
deed, and - blazoned on the fropt of time In
eloquence of song and action. .-.
â¢ â¢ â¢ we poor anaemies of the effete East
have never perceived the wonders of our Zelie.
whom indeed we have loved, but decorously,
and In all seemllness' of fancy.
On Â¦ the other hand, I when Mme. Calve first
revealed her Carmen to us we gasped for
breath and thought that the" mysteries of
Pathos had â¢come to disclose themselves upon
the operatic stage. Is all this fled, like "the
baseless fabric of a vision V Has Carmen re
formed? Shall there be no more cakes and ate
and shall not ginger be hot In the mouth?
These are truly vital questions, for if our Car
men have lost her savor wherewith shall the
opera season be spiced? â¢ â¢' â¢ But let us
rejoice and be exceedingly glad. Our Carmen
has not reformed. I Too chaste, indeed, for
wicked. San Francisco, she Is bad enough for
us.
Â»Â¦-â¢.-.â¢
And last night she had an added abandon,
which affected her heels. These became elo
quent â eloquent of. a coarseness which our
Carmen, unruly as she 'was, did not have
In the brazen days of old. Otherwise our Car
men has not chanced. . She has a new gown
for her first act ' and a new fan, and she kisses
her hands at the gallery. Our Carmen has
her vajcarles of -. demonstration, sometimes
wilder, sometimes more sober, but she is al
ways the same Carmen, full of diablerie and as
fascinating as the basilisk. And the voice?
That, too. Is the same, a strangely scintillant.
penetrating voice, shot through with many
colors, like a prism in the sunlight. Polish
and finesse you shall vainly seek in the art of
this Carmen, but there is witchery that may
not : be . denied. In short, while cold criticism
can by analysis find a hundred faults in. this,
impersonation, â¢ its potency : cannot bÂ« con
cealed, and in the end it evades critical* sum
mary. .

This must in great measure account for the ability of American roads to pay interest
and earn dividends while their rates are so much less than those of Europe and their wages are

THERE is ground for the ; complaint that American railroads are overcapitalized, not all of
them, but many of. them. The stock 'watering-,, which was taught to Wall street; by the
company of Ohio farmers that â¢ built . what is now! the Lake Shore road, has been cften
used. In other cases the increase in. stock has been justified as the only -means of repre
â¢ senting the increased value of lines tliat have been enhanced by development. When the country
is pinched by hard times the rates made necessary to. sustain this advanced valuation xall atten
tion to it, and it is criticized as the soecial odium of American railway management.
The London. Economist in dealing with a comparative statement of American and Eng
lish railways gives facts that put ourVAmerican; roads in a much more favorable light. By this it
appears that the average .capitalization of "American: railways is '$61,884 per mile, while that pf
the, English roads is $270,000 per mile. Comparing the London and Northwestern with the
Pennsylvania Central,' the Economist finds that the operating expenses of the" American road are
65.62 per cent, of vi^s revenues, and of the English; road 65.3 per centâ about equal. But the
cost charged , against transport atidn alone was 42.4 on the English road and 35.4 on the Ameri
can, ; and fot general expenses the percentage was 9.2 and 2.22. \The Pennsylvania road showed a
much higher expenditure for equipment. In earnings "the English road showed more than four
times as much per ton mile as' the American road, the English freight charge being more than
"three times as high as the American. t . .. '
It is also shown that the character of construction Jn this . country is much superior to the
English, and the railroad wages are much higher here than there. At the same time the cost of
operating is continually decreasing here and increasing in England.- In the last ten years Eng
lish riiileage has increased 8 -per cent and capitalization 38; per cent, while here the increase in
mileage .and in capitalization.- have kept more nearly neck' and neck. â . . Â¦ ' . >
The showing is highly flattering' to American roads, and seems to indicate that many com
plaints, made against them are not based in. good reason.; It is surely a conspicuous triumph for
American administration that with much higher wages- we enjoy the use of our roads for less than
one-third the English rate, and that at a capitalization per mile $208,116 less than in England
we show superior quality in construction and spend more upon equipment.
v All this may seem like a riddle to our English friends, f But it. must be caused by the great
superiority in our operating methods, a. higher class of employes and a closer study of economy
in the adaptation of means to ends. . . â¢ .
American railroading, has certain features' that go to the training of employes that are not
known abroad. All of bur great maintain, schools of instruction. An American engineer
does not handle his locomotive by routine. Heiis learned in the application of steam to power;
in the laws of vapor expansion and knows", the mechanism, of his machine.. In like manner
train crew's are instructed in the laws of friction and traction. Professors in our universities are
employed in their vacation to visit railway division headquarters and lecture, to the crews on the
nature of colors, on lubrication, heat/ the curve thrust of trains, and all the.natural and mechan
ical laws that enter into the operation of a railway. Instruction is also given in the philosophy of
transportation, its relation to the development of tonnage, and. of its cost, to the profit of
handling. - f
â¢ - Railroading here is something more than common labor. It is treated as a great industrial
specialty in which every employe is given the chance to know why he does everything pertaining
â¢ to the ooeration of a train. ' * '. . Â¦ > /

some histrionic ability, and her -school

TO THEIR JOSS
Captain Horne is a married man. and Jt
:s said that his home is at Prescott, Ariz
A strange feature of the affair is that
the captain was in his slippers at the
lime of the occurrence.
Captain Surgeon Dade saw Home at 6
o'clock yesterday afternoon, when he ap
peared all right and did not show any
sigr-s of drink. Captain Hazzard and oth
er officers were amazed last night on be
ing told of the captain's attempt to take
his life. To none had he shown the
slightest disposition to commit such an
act. .
At the Occidental Hotel the news of the
captain's attempt at self-destruction came
as a surprise, and there it is stated that
Korne had not shown any signs of having
indulged in liquor.
Four men held him down while Dr.
Farmer held his hands and head. He con
tinually asked the -doctor to let his head
Â£O, and in reply to Inquiries said:
"What did I do it for? What do you think
I did it for? I'll either get hung or life,
but I'll get another chance."
The ambulance from the Receiving Hos
pital was summoned and Home was taken
there. The doctors of tno hospital be
lieve he Is or has been suffering from de
lirium, tremens.
Against that opinion is the positive
statement of Dr. Farmer, who said as pos
itively .that Home' did jiot -appear to haye
been drinking to any extent and that
there was oily the very faintest odor of
liquor from ills breath.
Captain Home arrived from -Manila In
December and registered at the Occiden
tal. He then left San Francisco and re
turned on Friday, having received an or
der to appear before the retiring board
held at the Presidio.
While doing service at Manila the cap
tain was seriously ill in the hospital, suf
fering from dysentery and fever, and has
been an Invalid for some time.
"He wriggled," said the doctor, "in hU 1
desire to aggravate the wound and'In
crease the flow of blood." - !
"It is." eald Dal Porto, and In an In
stant Kerne grabbed -It and slashed him
self across his - throat. Dal Porto, not
withstanding his surprise, grappled with
the captain and a* desperate struggle f ol- j
lovred, in which the fruit man received a i
slight cash xin the right side of his neck, j
The shouting and the bcuflle between*
the two men, both standing six feet hlgli "
and each weighing about 200 pounds,' {
brought a crowd, and with the aid of sev
eral men Home was held down until
ocieted, when he was taken by his cap
tors to the Lnion square drug store.

The lot of Germans in Prussian Poland
is full of vexations.. The ! Poles are in
geniously, nagging the teachers :' and of
ficials, and; boycotts are serving as a sys
tem of petty intimidation. The'Govern
ment has decided to station garrisons in
the small towns, in order to -give moral
support to the German element. 'This
step has caused, a fresh outburst of popu
lar feeling, the : inference " being that " the
Government' intends to Introduce coercive
measures. This, however, does not appear
to be the- case. The whole Polish ques
tion will come up for discussion before the
Diet on Monday, when the debate will be
gin with an interpellation on the subject.
Since last summer, when the Foreign
Office gave little encouragement to the
representations of the United States Em
bassy on the subject, a change in the Gov
ernment's . attitude has taken â¢ place.
Though Baron von Rlchthofen, the For
eign Minister, "has not committed the
Government to anything elaborate or even
to anything specific, he now shows readi-,
ness to promote the, adequate representa
tion of Germany. Were the St. Louis dele
gates here at present they would be wel
comed and given an opportunity to pre
sent definite requests. German manufac
turers have taken considerable interest In
the expositlon.-Judglne from the inquhie.s
made at the United States Consulate.
The Prince of Wales' visit to Emperor
William on the occasion Â¦Â¦Â¦ of the latter's
birthday, will be for only, a day. Those
who see In this visit a desire on the p.irt
of the British Government to show good
will toward Germany are quite mistaken.
It is intended simply as a token of King
Edward's personal regard for Emperor
William. The Prince of Wales has de
clined all invitations . to entertainments
proposed in his honor, including a recep
tion by the German- regiment â¢ of â¢ which
King Edward is colonel, so that the Ger
mans may be -.under no misapprehension
regarding the private and personal char
acter of the visit. Had the Prince of.
Wales been here this morning he would
not have been able to read any Berlin
periodical that did not contain lampoon*
of his father, caricatures of Lord Kitch
ener, or brutal descriptions of British in
humanity in .South Africa. â¢. ..
Considering that Chancellor von Bu
low's two speeches and the utterances of
the German vMlnister to Â¦, Great Britain,
P^rince Wolff Metternich, at Hamburg,
were deliberate efforts on the part of the
Government to .demonstrate friendliness
toward Great Britain,' the illustrated
papers here show singular malignity, in
giving gruesome representations of the
tortures of innocents in the South -African
concentration camps. "These: things do not
affect I the inflexibly correct Â¦ attitude of
the Government, but they intensify the
already heated ; feeling against Great
Britain. â¢ ; ' *
BERLIN, Jan. 11.â Whether by reason
of President Roosevelt's especially cordial
personal communication to Emperor Wil
liam, recently transmitted unofficially, or
because the United States has shewn
more than passive grood will toward Ger
many in the Venezuelan entanglement,
the Foreign Office here shows a disposi
tion to forward any object in which the
United States is interested. Consequent
ly this is the moment for the St.. Louis
Exposition management to tell- the Ger
man Government what it desires for the
fair. /Â«

The New Discovery for Catarrh Seems to
Possess Remarkable Merit.
Anew catarrh cure has recently ap-
peared which so far as tested has ! been
remarkably successful in curing all forms
of catarrh, whether in the head, throat,
bronchial tubes or in stomach and liver. :
The remedy is in tablet form, pleasant
and convenient â¢ to -take, and no â¢ special
secrecy is maintained as to what It con-
tains, the tablet being a scientific Â¦ com-
bination of Blood root. Red gum and Sim-'
ilar valuable and harmless antiseptics. ;
1 The safe and effective catarrh cure may
be found at any drug store % under the
name of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
Whether the catarrh Is located in the
nose, throat, bronchial tubes or stomach,
the tablets seem .to act with. equal suc-
cess, removing the stuffy feeling in heaÂ«l
and nose, clearing the mucous membrane
of throat and trachea from catarrhal se-
cretions, which cause the tickling,* cough-
ing, hawking and gagging so annoying to
every Â¦ catarrh sufferer. ." Â¦ - ,
' Nasal catarrh generally leads to ulcera-
tlon, in some cases to such an as
to destroy the nose entirely; and in many
old cases of catarrh the. bones of the head
become 'diseased. Nasal, catarrh . grad-
ually extends to the throat and bronchial
tubes and- very often to the. stomach,
causing that ! very obstinate trouble, , ca-
tarrh of the stomach. < '
* " Catarrh * Is ' a "systemic poison, | inherent
in the blood, and local washes, douches,
salves,. inhalers f and sprays can-have- no
effect on the real cause of ' the disease.
An internal remedy | which acts upon the
blood: is the only rational' treatment- and
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets is the safest of
all internal remedies, as well as the most
convenient and Satisfactory from a 'med-
ical â¢ standpoint. . â¢ ;Â¦; - -.';.-Â¦
â¢ Dr.' Eaton recently stated "that : he- had
successfully used : Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets in". old chronic cases, even where ul-
ceration , had extended so far l as to de-
stroy the septum - of . the ; nose.'"; He says :
i "I â¢ am pleasantly surprised . almost ' every
day by the excellent results from Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets, l It is remarkable how
they remove the^excessive> se-
cretion 'and ; bring v about â¢< a healthy con-
dition of the mucous membranes of the
nose; throat and btomacn.". f. â¢

During the whole hour the streets
around the City Hall were packed, and
when the admiral came out he found the
crowd as large and as enthusiastic as
when he went in. Many . of the people
gathered at ..General Gordon's residence
and 'cheered the adnrlrar as he ' went up
the steps.
The reception was held in the council
chamber of the City . Hall, which was
handsomely decorated for the occasion
with flags and palms. A line was formed
and the multitude pressed in to greet the
admiral and assure him of their respect
and esteem. Workingmen, as well as
bankers, merchants and professional men.
were 'in the line. There were- several
thousand women, some in silks and some
in the dress of the poorer classes. To
each the admiral gave a hearty hand
shake.
SAVANNAH, Ga., Jan. ll.-Rear Ad

was . escorted to 'the building by Mayor
Meyers and a delegation of Aldermen,
and was accompanied by Mrs. Schley and
General and Mrs. "William W. Gordon, at
whose residence he and Mrs. Schley are
visiting.
- Bull- street from General Gordon's,resi
dence to the City Hall was lined with
people, and as the carriages bowled along
tha cheering kept pace with the vehicles.
Nearly every store along the route
showed- â¢ a United States flag. At
the-. . City Hall, which ' was covered
with bunting, a squad of mounted police
men had difficulty in holding the crowd
back.- The admiral bowed and smiled
in response, to the demonstrations along

. All along the line, wherever there are
oil . properties, 'there has been an attempt
during the. last /week- to get Â» an 1 expres
sion of views.:from the officers of the As
sociated Oil Company. President C. A.
Canfield â¢ told the Bakersfield . Calif ornlan

Company will benefit the Industry and be
an. advantage to Bakersflejd. "The con

Canfield. "Unless something Is done to
help the oil interests there will \be a lot
of bankrupts owning oil lands and oil
wells. -I believe the combine will be of
great, assistance .to >the industry and to
the city of Bakersfield as well." .
I The Los Angeles people have come to
the conclusion that, there Is no third; oil
sand in the local field. . The Los Angeles
Herald gives an account of the experi
ment upon which this opinion is based
as follows :
' After the expenditure of much time and
money it appears to have been determined that
there, is no third oil sand In .the Los Angeles
field: -/That, at least, is the conclusion arrived
at' by a number of the prominent operators,
who base their opinion. upon the experience of
Mes3ra. Lemberger. Moody aSid Phillips in sink
ing their well on First street. The trioÂ»of oper
ators named, have been drilling a well. -on. First
street, between Belmont and Union avenues
on the I Deal lot. and struck a fair - flow of oil
In the second sand. They then had what was
considered ; a fifteen-barrel well, but the firm
was desirous of testing whether a third sand
did not exist, which, if reached. . would assure
a more prolific and longer lived well. For the
Burpose of testing the matter drilling was con
tinued, but now the well is .being abandoned
at a depth of 1307 feet.. For.the last 100 feet
the drill has be,en, working In awater Â»and.as
white, as that bordering the sea. and this is
accepted as demonstrating that . there is no
third oil sand in the local field, this well be
ing the deepest of any drilled. â¢ '.;-Â¦
Messrs. Lemberger, Moody* and . Phillips an
now having the casting drawn from this test
well, and are > about to begin a new well on
their lease on .Adobe and Bernardo streets.
A goo-J deal of disappointment is felt at this
failure on Â¦ the part â¢ i of Â¦ Messrs. Lemberger.
Moody and Phillips to reach a third sand, but
the result appears to be conclusive. Whether
it will be accepted as a finality, however, re
mains to be seen. â¢ Many of the shallow wells
have been deepened, with advantage, and It
may be that, reasoning by analogy, -some of
these producers will not yet surrender the Idea
that at greater depth even better results may
bo attained; . \ Â¦ . .- . v- .......
B -F^-. Brooks of the "executive board of

We will- start off with an assured Income of

Governor Sayres has I ordered the Statepur-'
chasing agent and all superintendents of State
institutions to' adopt oil, .Instead 'of coal -and
wood, for fuel. In these institutions, where ex
periments have been carried' on, ' it' has Â¦ been
found that the saving under present prices and
rates of transportation is about 40 , per, cent.
This will mean a great reduction if or the State
in ; the 'â¢ item ' of ; fuel , expense,-, amounting . to
something^ like i?8000 Â¦ annually. "It , is confi
dently predicted by oil J men i that . the price of
fuel oil, will be reduced about. 40 per cent.- thus
making three. and a, half.; barrels cost $1, plus

an aggregate capacity ,qf 3,000,000 barrels

output of the world for the year 1900. Mr;
Benjamin makes an interesting state
ment,which has local bearing: '-The cost
of transportation In Texas," he says, "Is
about 35 cents per barrel for a -distance
of 1000 miles when , measured by the
freight rate on a ton of coal. This will

Chamberlain concluded by paying trib
utes to Lord Kitchener's stern resolution-,
the army's cheerful courage and Lord
Milner's wise administration.
Our American kinsfolk agreed to a treaty
to enable the construction of an lnteroceanlc
canal which I believe will be of great ad
vantage to the commerce of the world, as it
will be of great advantage to the United
States. I might have included the struggle
between the Boers and Great Britain for su

Folid achievements in the cause of peace and
If we have been unable to remove Continental
prejudice, which has always existed, but -was
never more coarsely expressed, we have at least
been enabled to settle many substantial differ
ences which might have caused international
conflict.
Chamberlain said that when the present
Ministry came Into office it was at a timo
when the country was at peace with the
world, but the Cabinet had to meet at
least six burning questions of interna
tional Importance. These legacies which
Lord Salisbury had to take up included
the Venezuelan boundary question, the
Samoan difficulty and the French posi
tion on the Nile, all of which the Govern
ment successfully grappled with and dis
posed of. Chamberlain added:
How can I be made responsible for what
Lord Grey hai called "filthy lies," anil", vl at
Lord Rosebery described as "vile, infamous
falst-hoods," which have been diss*m'naied in
fcrelg-n countries without a syllable cf pro
te&t, without the slightest Interference by re
sponsible authorities? My opponents must find
some other scapegoat; they must Jook further
for tho causes of hostility, which i <1j not think
Reserved, but which always com;s to the tur
face when we are In difficulty, and which I
am glad to say has never done us tsurlou* harm.
I do not deprecate the importance of the
gocd will of foreign nations, but there Is some
thing more important. It is the affection, of
our kinsfolk across the sea. Even our grait
losses In the war that has been forced upon
us have brought In tbeir train one blessing:
of Infinite and lasting importance. That war
has enabled the British empire to find itself,
and has shown to all whom it may concern
Oiat 1/ ever again we have, as Jn the past, to
fcght lor our very existence aga'.nst the world
in arms, we Â¦null be supported by the Kins of
Britain In every quarter of the globe.
What I have raid, I have said. I withdraw
nothing. I qualify nothing, I defend nothing.
As I read history no British Minister' has
ever served his country faithfully and at the
same time been popular -abroad.- I therefore
make allowance lor foreign criticism. I will
not (cl'iow the example that has be<m sÂ«t me.
I do not want to give lessons to a foreign

There have been no sensational discoveries
of new placer gold fields during 1901. Some
discoveries have been made that may become'
sensational In 1902. The same statement is to
be made of lode gold mines. . .There are as yet
no new gold fields though some notable discov.
erles that may -become gold fields in 1902.
There has been a marked widening of the
limits of old gold producing districts every
where and some notable examples of success
ful re-exploitation of supposedly worked out
mines.
Gold mining in 1001 has been a steady com
mercial business. Â¦Â¦- Operators, having practically,
no concern as to sale prices .have beenengaged
in effecting: economies which, Increasing the ef
ficiency of labor, lower the . cost of . produc
tion. The average cost of producing gold Is
certainly lower at the end- of 11KHL than it was
at the beginning. In part this is apt to be
overlooked, as reductions 'In the cost "of pro
duction simultaneously bring within commer
cial reach gold bearing, deposits that, before
costs were reduced were unutlllzable.
Mining bas been improved and cheapened by
a more general use of vertical shafts in lode
mines, by the more general use of power drills,
and by the much extended use of electric power
transmissions. In placer mining the employ
ment of dredgers has become more general,
and the costs of operation have also been re
duced by the use of electric power. The aver
age production of units of gold-bearing rock
to the unit of day's labor of the miner has
been increased more than his wages. In mill
ing and reduction the cyanide process has been
more widely applied. In South Dakota and
Montana, particularly, this process, as install
ed in 1901. will result in a large Increase in
production and profits during lÂ«02 and after
ward. Lesser economies and reductions in
cost have been effected by the use of conveying
machinery and in improvements in the detail
of concentration methods. Both gold mining
and milling are becoming more exclusively me
chanical, more efficient to the end desired, and
cob t less on the average than at the beginning:

of their wonderful appliances asd external applicatfonsi consequently,
the oonfidins; sufferers have been duped and disappointed by these quacks
ro they have lost confidence In humanity, bat in spite of all this, the
riDEMTY method has grown and is oicd by several hundred arradaated
phrsiclans from the Atlantic to the Pacific, all Of whom have been spe-
olally educated by Dr. Wrar or some of his qualified physicians how to
apply this urcat and grand Cure. In order to establish public confidence,
<-nch doctor will treat every case that is pronounced ourable upon the
plan of "no pay until cared," and when the patient ts dischara-ed a "Cer-
tificate of Cure" is issued, which is arood in any of these offices for future
attention, if necessary, free of eharg-e. No other medical concern in the
world can make a similar offer, or dare to conduct their practice upon
like business principles, for they cannot produoe a. cure that will stay

opportunity to be made whole again.
Of what use are riches and position if one has a defective body and
hovers over an open grave, for one knows not what moment strangula-

where . the * money was Brooks, replied
that it was on deposit in one: of -the sav
ings::, banks.: ..Baehr then- requested
Brooks: to return the money, but he re
fused, saying: ~ . - . ,. .; '. Â¦ ' â¢".â¢

as yet rendered no decision *on the ap
pealed case of: Assessor Dodge, ;who sued
tor $31,299 60 in commissions on poll taxes
and was given a favorable t decision . by

had a certificate of deposit for the. $8817 63
and that he would turn it over to the
court pending ithe final decision, in. the
Dodge case, which affects other kinds of
commissions. fP, Baehr, however, insisted

LONDON, Jan. 11.â Now that William

reason to believe that under anything like

courseâNew Stallion
Stakes.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. ll.-The officers of
the State Board of Agriculture at a meet T
ing held this afternoon expressed the
opinion that auction pools and parls
mutuels only should be allowed on har
ness races hereafter at the State Fair
meetings, and., the bookmaklng -only
should be permitted on running races.
It was deemed advisable, however, for
the secretary to communicate with har
ness horsemen throughout the State and
obtain their views on this subject, In or
der that the board may act decisively
thereon at Its next meeting,. February 8.
This will be the annual meeting of the
board. | There were present- to-day Presi
dent A. B. Spreckels and Directors Grove
L. Johnson. Frank H. Covey, C. W.
Paine, Park Henshaw, John Mackey, B.
H. Hush and J. E. Terry.
The time of closing for" the entry of
foals In the running stallion stake of 1903
was extended from January 1 to March 1,
1902. It was decided to refer the matter
of selling Agricultural Park to a commit
tee consisting of Directors Johnson,.Hen
shaw and Mackey, with instructions to
confer with Senator R. T. Devlin, who
drafted the. bill permitting the sale of
the property.' The committee will report
to tho board on the subject at the next
meeting.
The present course Is located ln a val
uable residence section of the city. It Is
thought It can be sold profitably and a
new and. Improved track established out
side the city limits. The intention of the
board to sell 'the property has given rise
to further talk about removing the State
Fair to San Jose or Oakland. Directors
spoken to on the subject declare there Is
nothing more ln this than the rumors
which have always been afloat* and -that
no fault Is found with Sacramento. A
new stallion stake for harness horses, to
be contested for ln 1905, was adopted by
the board, with conditions as follows:

WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.â Because of its
position at the Caribbean entrance of the
proposed Nacaragua canal, the cession of
Jamaica to the United States will certain
ly not occur until economic conditions
force Great Britain to take this action.
This view was expressed to-night by ad
ministration officials upon a report from
London /hat the decision of the British
Government upon the question of impos
ing a countervailing duty on sugar will
determine the future status of the British
West Indies. In the opinion of diplomats,
as well as of officials, all of the West
Indies will some day belong to the United
States, but Great Britain will undoubtedly
hold her possessions in the Caribbean Sea
as long as possible.
Consular reports from Jamaica show
that the United States Is the largest cus
tomer of Jamaica. She receives 63.7 per
cent of her imports from this country and
sends 63.6 per cent of her exports Â¦ here.
Great Britain gives Jamaica 33.19 per cent
of her products, and receives 19.2 per cent
of Jamaican exports. Denmark's main
reason for parting with her West India
islands is that they are a drain upon her,
and the same reason may strongly appeal
some day to Great Britain.

"I am up In 'Hamlet,' " he said. Â¦ Â¦
- He was given the role and that night
the audience heard "Hamlet" by a beard
less stripling, essaying the part .that the
great Sheridan had made world renowned.
Holden subsequently became identified
with the front of the house, going out
as manager for the veteran, Lewis Mor
rison. He was Morrison's first manager.
# Â¦ H . ( ;.. : ., IllIli: , : , l i l ,i. l i,. I ,i., I ..i..H,?H^4'^4
His theatrical life was .interesting from
the outset. Twenty-two years ago when
Sheridan was playing "Hamlet" in the
old California-street Theater Stock Com
pany in San Francisco, Holden, then 17
years of age,- had a small part In the
production. One night Sheridan was too
ill to appear. The management was at a
loss to fill the vacancy. Holden presented
himself.
The beginning of the end came about
two months ago, when Miss Mjller and
Holden, as manager and leading man, left
Oakland on a southern tour. The com
pany, because of financial stress, was
compelled to disband at Santa Cruz. Miss
Miller took the experience to heart and
soon after her - return- was stricken and
died.
Holden was never himself after that and
when he succumbed to a raging fever that
"brought delirium - in . its , train his friends
knew what was the cause."'
OAKLAND. Jan. 11.â Grief and
shock over the death of the late
jMaud Miller, actress and daugh
ter of Joaquih Miller, the ' poet,
play a leading part in the pass
ing away last night of Edward J. Holden,
the actor-manager, whose last call came
after a week's illness at a privte hospital
in this city. .' V
Barely two weeks had elapsed .' since
Maud Miller, crushed by the failure of a
theatrical tour she had begun under Hol
den's management, succumbed and was
taken to a lonely grave on the Heights,
her famous father's home In the hills be-r
yond Frultvale.
When friends told him of Maud Mil
ler's death, Holden gave way completely
and there was no concealment of his bit
ter sorrow. At the simple funeral at the
Miller home, conducted by the poet, the
actor was a weeping mourner. When the
actress' body was laid in the grave a sin
gle lily, the tribute from her friend, was
resting. upon her breast.
That was on Christmas day. .> Last Sat
urday Holden broke down and was later
placed in the sanitarium where he passed
away. The grave closes a romance as
real as the footlights' tales are artificial.
The note la a confession of guilt of a
murder that startled the farming commu
nity of Whidby Island nve years ago. Tha
murder Itself had been committed threa
years previously. In 1893 H. Garrison, a
well-to-do farmer near Coupeville, dis
appeared from his home and was never
again seen. Three years later laborers
cleaning out an abandoned well found- a
body. From the clothing and trinkets In
the pockets it was identified as that at
Garrison.
A brother of Garrison took up tha
search for the murderer. Sheriff Cudahy
of this county, then a city detective, was
interested in the case, and following up
the various slender clews at length traced
a chain of circumstantial evidence that
led to the arrest of Walter Erving. (The
name is misspelled in the suicide's note.)
Erving was a young man of good family,
who three years before had been era
ployed by Garrison as a farm hand. Tha
evidence was not entirely satisfactory,
but It served. In the temper of the Whid
by Island jury, to Justify a verdict of
murder in the first degree. Erving was
sentenced to twenty years In Walla Wal
la. He has now served four years.
SEATTLE, Jan. 1Lâ The mystery sur*
rounding the unknown man who commit
ted suicide by the dynamite method, and!
whose mutilated body was found by
school children near Thirteenth avenue,
last night, deepened to-night with the dis
covery of a scrawled note confessing " a
murder committed on Whidby Island
eight years ago, for which. If the confes
sion be true, an Innocent man Is serving
time in the State penitentiary.
The spot where the body was found at
tracted much attention to-day. Among
those visiting it was a schoolboy, who
happened to see and pick up a crumpled
bit of paper near where the body lay.
There was writing on it, but the boy did
not grasp Its meaning. He showed tho
scrawl to a man standing near, and tha
latter, filled with the import of the note,
hastened to police headquarters. The
wording was as -follows;

SOCIETY HAS
BUSIEST DAY
OF THE SEASON
The attendance in " the various high
schools, i was also considerably increased
as a result of the Christmas promotions!
from the eighth grades. The Girls' High
School received 90 new pupils, the Lowell
High 100, Mission High 60 and the Poly
technic High 40, It is not thought, how
ever, that any additional teachers will be
required in the high schools. *
The board decided to >' establish \ addi
tional classes â¢ in the Spring Valley and
Hearst schools. -The "attendance is rap
idly increasing In both schools. -
The Board of Education will in future
appoint principals from the ranks . of
teachers instead of selecting outsiders, as,
was done on several occasions. Mayor
Schmltz in his Inaugural address'ex
pressed himself in favor of the promotion
of teachers for; meritorious service, and
he will be supported by Directors Mark
and Roncovleri in that position/ -'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦
'Â¦ Mayor Schmltz conveyed the informa
tion I yesterday to the three J old members
of the ,; Board ' of r ; Education that he j de
sired harmony, to exist between jthat ;body
end the Superintendent of Schools. The
information was given to Directors pen
man, Mark "'and Casserly; by the newly
appointed v member, Â¦: ; Alfred Roncovieri.
Thelatter stated that the Mayor was dis
pleased at 1, the continual" quarreling in
dulged i by the Vupper" and "lower" of
fices. - Scbmltz,- believing that such ac
tion has a bad effect on pupils and teach
ers, . desired to acquaint t the three direc
tors 1 that' a continuance of' the , strained
relations would be displeasing * to him.
In fact, he Intimated that If the bicker-
Ing did not . cease he would use the au
thority . vested in him to ' stop Â¦ it.
~ Koncovieri's ,- remarks â¢ somewhat stag
gered his Â¦ associates on * the board, but
they stated that they saw the > force Â« of
the : reasoning - and incidentally appreci
ated ', the veiled :Â¦., threat of Mayor Schmitz
* to insist on compliance with his orders
under pain of dismissal. That the Mayor's
intention bore good fruit was evident
when President Denman ordered the sec
retary to send a communication to Su
perintendent Webster inviting that offi
cial to be present at the secret session of
the board. \ v ;'
The best informed opinion inclines to
the belief that the- Cabinet will not con
sent to the imposition of countervailing
duties, for fear of raising a storm of in
ternal criticism from the old school of
free traders, who constitute a formidable
wing of the Unionist party. The memo
randum which Chamberlain, will present
on Monday is worded more In the nature
of an ultimatum than any hitherto pre
sented to the Government, and while it
does not openly threaten secession,, that
phase of the situation has been verbally
communicated by the Colonial Secretary.
It is almost -needless to add that the de
cision of the Cabinet will be kept- a pro
found secret, at least until January 20,
when the British delegates return to the
Brussels Sugar Conference. It is said
Chamberlain realizes- the gravity of the
crisis and favors imposing countervailing
duties, but the personnel of the large Cab
inet includes so many utterly differing
economic views that .-- it is doubtful
whether Chamberlain will win the day.
Lord Salisbury and his , colleagues will
then decide whether Great Britain will
put a countervailing duty on sugar. Co
lonial Secretary Chamberlain _ will submit
a statement, made up on the unimpeach
able evidence of the West Indian authori
ties, that if this step is not taken the
sugar industry In the West Indian Islands
will be dead within a year and the West
Indies hopelessly bankrupt.
The British delegates to the Brussels
Sugar Conference will also report that
there is no likelihood of the continental
nations abolishing bounties unless Great
Britain declares her intention of imposing
countervailing duties should the bounties
be continued. The preliminary sessions of
the Brussels Sugar Conference have con
vinced the British delegates that the con
tinental powers only desire at most to
amend the bounty system, and that this
is chiefly due to the hope of placating
their own consumers, i

EUREKA. Jan. 11.â The kitchen of a
small restaurant conducted by J. H. G.
Haenfel was the scene of a terrible trag
edy at 10:30 o'clock to-night. Haenfel
shot and killed his wife in the presence,
of his seven young children and then put*
an endi to his own life by firing a bullet
through his heart.
The crime had evidently been premedi
tated for some time and a brief family
quarrel furnished the murderer an op
portunity to make good his threats and
accomplish his horrible purpose.
The Haenfels had not lived happily for a
number of months, Â«the chief cause of the
domestic infelicity being the despondency
of the husband, whose business affaira
were far from being prosperous. His little
restaurant was a failure and he found it
difficult to adequately provide for the nu
merous children. It is said that on several
occasions he had remarked his purpose to
take his own life, but his wife was dis
posed to doubt the sincerity of his threat.
The quarrel this evening began when
the family were gathered in the kitchen.
Mrs. Haenfel was sitting in a chair and
was sewing. After a short exchange of
angry words the husband, without' warn
ing, seized a 6hotgun and discharged the
contents of one of the barrels at-his wife.
The Bhot struck the woman on the side
of the head, tearing away nearly all the
flesh from her face. Mrs. Haenfel fell
from the chair and the children ran
Bcreaxrlng from th.e room. '#Â¦"*
The murderer was not satisfied with this
much of his fiendish work, but stood over
the prostrate body, and again fired, this
time at the woman's breast. The weapon
was held so close that the garments and
flesh are powder-burned. Haenfel then
went into another room and, obtaining a
pistol, shot himself In the heart.
The eldest child, a girl of 12 years, noti
fied the police. The husband and wife
were both dead when the officers entered
the house. Haenfel left a note in which
he appointed the Masonic lodge here the
guardian of his children.
Mrs. Haenfel formerly lived In San
Francisco. Her 6lster, Mrs. Fred Krouse,
lives at 134 Taylor street, in that city.

Instead . of" having â¢ the proposed bond
elections for ;. public improvements /"-. next
month, as the. last Board of â¢ Supervisors
intended, the various propositions may
â¢not'W submitted to a vote of the. people
until nextf November or even later. Su
pervisor Braunhart, the newly elected
chalrman l oftho Committee on. Public
Jtftlities, 1 â¢ discovered* yesterday . that a
doubt exists whether the new general reg
istration required by the State law for
elections to be held- this year will operate
on those 'for bonded^ Improvements. As
registration does not close until forty
days preceding the next municipal election
to be held on November 4, Braunhart is
of the opinion that -the bond elections
could not be, held until a later date. The
disputed point will be submitted' to ;the
City Attorney to decide if the new regis
tration governs in bonded elections.
Another factor that will certainly post
pone some of the bonded elections at least
is that the : charter requires . complete
plans on any proposed Improvement â¢ or
utility to be incorporated in the call for a
bonded election. The final publication of
the declaratory ordinances Â¦ for sewers,
hospital, school houses, parks, play
grounds and fire houses will be completed
on January 21. ' "Within two weeks the Su
pervisors, must call a special election for
submission to the electors of the proposi
tions. It is plain that the time is too short
for plans to be prepared . for - the new
school houses and fire houses.' 'The plans
for the sewer system and city, hospital are
complete, but It . will take Â¦ some time to
prepare those for six school houses. Even
the style - of building must â¢ bo designated
in the call and the seven sites for, school
houses must be particularly specified, and
these have not yet been selected. The
site for a proposed children's playground
already comprises a school lot and Braun
hart thinks that the preliminary ordinance
is defective on that point. ..The City At
torney will be asked to unravel the knot
ty points, and it Is highly probable that
the board will have"- to begin all-over
again by suspending further,; publication
of the declaratory ordinances. ; Braunhart
says that undue haste was manifested by
the last board and that openings were left
to : invalidate the proposed bond issues by
non-compliance with , the . legal â¢' technicall-'
ties on the- questions. r â¢ .-â¢--.->

Parasite Germ That Causes It.
Baldness follows falling hair, falling
hair follows dandruff; and dandruff ts the
result of a germ digging Its way Into the
ecalp to tfle root of the hair, where It saps
the vitality of the hair. To destroy th-it
germ Is to prevent as well as cure dan-
druff, falling hair,, and. lastly, baldness
There Is only one preparation known to
<Jo that, Newbro's Herpldde. an enUrelv

has been tried it has proven wonderfully
Fucceseful. It can't be otherwise, because
It utterly destroys the dandruff germ.

TO HOLD ITS EliZCTIOIT
bmbc time ia expeclation of an outside de
mand found a i>oor market In which to dis-
IK>ee of their holding's. There vu a decline In
I'rieee arid then dullness and irregularity, in
;he' normal course of such movements. The
*tiort coJitrcjctB put out bv the bears while the
liquidation ves in progress were co\ f ered later,
cauting the recovery in prices. With the
< wariujr out of these lanre speculative con
tracts th(! volume of transactions in the mar-
Ket fell away and the market became largely
:-n aCair of board-room professionals, whose
tactics operate to keep the price range within
::arrow limits. Any (sustained . movement in
any Erection must await the action of genu
ine bolder* or genuine demand for
slock. tineculative sentiment showed con
iusion and hesitation as to -which dl
i-ectjon the new movement would ul
timately take. The Belling of the week was
due more to prcnt-taking and the failure of
expected favorable dex-elopmcnt* and " their
(Â¦fleets- than ;o any positively depressing In
(!uenot-. Much lias been counted on from the
â¢lanuary relaxation of the money market, due
to the reasonable disbursement of yearly
I rcptg aid to the usual return of currency
rum the channels of the active holiday trade.
lhÂ«-e influences have been at work In the
im;tiey market, which has become notably
t-aiier. but the additions to resources cave
Â»iot beer so ereat as â¢ vvaK hoped and the
Â¦â¢"â¢â¢ra.1 public has r.ot been tempted to em
'tric in speculation. What relaxation has. oc-'
'â¢urred fcj meney has been offset as an influ
m ? lhe Pro s lÂ»Â«:tive foreign demand for
tola, torpign money markets fell into a con
01 ion of great Â«>ase immediately after the turn

ments, a ery largre revenue collections are to
"â¢ met In the English money market and a
new British war lean of Bome sort is in Im
.i^oiate prospect. London has counted upon
large supplies of French capital, owing to the
iÂ«rÂ»e accumulations in Paris, but Paris shows
indications of having other plans for employ

NEW TORK, Jan. II.â The small' net
changes !n stocks to-day ehowed that the
pelling by traders to realize practically coun
ter-balanced their earlier buying, and that
ths professionals had the market practically
to themselves. The market evidently con
tiues to settle toward dullness by progres
sive stages. The- buying this morning was in
anticipation cf a favorable bank statement,
and !n the hope that a strong showing by the
banks would reassure speculative sentiment
ar.S attract some buying cf stocks. The bank
statement did not disappointment expectations,
but it failed to induce any new buying. The
increase is c&sh reserves fell considers bly
telow the estimates, in epite of a hopÂ« that
last weci'a similar shortage might have
thrown a residue of gains over to this week
ty the eyEtem of 'eversg-es used In computa
tion. A ehlpmem of $500,000 In gold corrobor
ated the Impression that there would be ex
jorts cf trold In quantities next week. A
imall rank failure in Painesvllle, O.. supple
mentary to yesterday's failure In Cleveland.
Â¦raa an aid to the late reaction. American
Tobacco, unassested stock, made a further
of 25 points to 200 on the sale of a "Ein

There i*. therefore.' a discrepancy of.SSJ-tS,
Â¦nhich is between the total estimated and the
officially reported gain. It Is impossible rea
sonably to account for this wide difference.. It
it was due to the system of averages In mak
ing up the bank 8tat?mpnt It would seem that
the discrepancy of $5,164,200 between the esti
marrd and the official statement of January 4
should have been partly, at least, reconciled
last week, and yet It is seen that there was
then a further dlicrepaucy of *t.274.:!00. mak
ing, as above noted, a difference .of $C,4 > M..*00
for the fortnight.
It Is scarcely likely that the preliminary es
timates of caeh movements, .wnlch are care
fully prepared, can bs wholly responsible for
the discrepancy, and It would Mem to remain
with the banks to show. If they are eo disposed,
what has become of the cash which has been
traced to -these Institutions. Loans were de
creased last week by $5,300,800. probably re

The Financier says: The movement of
money into the banks from the Interior was
nulte large this week and the traceable net
rfpelpts from this source were $3,000,800. The
ordinary operations of the sub-treasury, in
stead of showing a loss to the banks, as, has
btcn the case each week since July 20,' 1001. in
dlcatrd the small gain to these institutions of
Â£U.30O. The receipts by the banks for new
gold and for bond purchases amounted to
SI. 060.700. Deducting $650,000 deposited by,
the batiks in -the sub-treasury for transfer to
New Orleans left $410. 700^ n*arly offsetting the
$000,000 gold' coin -which . was shipped 'to Eu
rope January 3. The result pf. these -.various
movements was an'estlmated gain by-the banks
of 58,011.800 cash.. The estimated Increase in
tic previous week was $8,622,000, making th*
gain for the fortnight $17,533,800. The bank
statement ' last \vÂ»Â«k, Â¦Â¦ however, showed an In
crease of only $5,637,500 cash. In the previous
week this Item was augmented in the official
returns by only '$3,457,800, making for the tmi
weeks a gain of $9,005,300. a* reported by the
statement.

NEW YORK STOCK LIST,
&tock market. The statement of the earnings
of the corporation for the December quarter
was a l:een disapnointroen to speculators
in its stocks, as the preliminary rumors
of earnings, which vere widely credited,
proved to have been- greatly exaggerated. The
selling of these stocks by disappointed holders
has had a notable sympathetic effect on the
whole market. > This has not be*n effectually
offset by the strength shown by a few special
â¢stocks from individual causes. . notably Sugar
and Manhattan. Confidence continues In the
general buslnes-s prospect, but the present
level of prices of securities is the subject of
eorne doubt.
Railroad and', miscellaneous bond" have
moved in sympathy with stocks, but over a
much narrower rsnse. . /- '.*?
United .States refunding 2s declined Y* and
the 2s coupons and 5s coupon advanced %
from the closing call of last week. .
Â£?h i!?-i he New Tork market covering foreign
Indebtedness contracted du*tfn K the past year
and especially In . the Northern Pacific stru^-
Ele. London also has been a steady seller of
securities in this market during this week.
It is generally expected, therefore, that a con
siderable outward movement of gold will set in
next week. The large requirements of our.own
tÂ»overnmejrt surplus come in for consideration
tr,^ I 1 U J ,f* ared that lh Â« treasury will find
increasing difficulty in finding means to re
lieve this drain upon the money market, ow
ing to the scarcity of Government bonds avail
able for redemption. / Sales of bonds to the
Government at present seem to Involve cor
responding retirements of bank corculatlon. in
dicating that there is more profit in the sale
or bonds than In keeping out circulation. This
contrasts with the continuing effects at this
time last year of the refunding la wv Involving
rayment of premium? upon refunded bonds,
and Increased privilege of bank circulation.
Bearing further on the money market are the
developments of unsoundncss in the rubber
market, the affairs of the trolley promoting
syndicate and the collapse of the asphalt trust.
The proceedings in the United States Supreme
Court against the Northern Securities Com
pany and the steps towards Investigating the
affairs of that corporation by the Interstate
Commerce Commission have been a depr*>t>Injr
influence, as it is believed they will retard
the plans of the promoters of that project for
the distribution of its shares and the active
operations in the stock market which <irÂ« ex
pected to accompany that distribution. There
has been disappointment also In the 'allure
of the United States Steel stocks to maintain
a leadership â¢ of an uoward movement In thÂ«
FlvÂ« or six cars of Oranges are announced
for to-morrow's auction. The market for all
citrus fruits remains the same.
Fancy red and Newtown Pippin Apples are
In demand. There are a good many blighted
and otherwise poor Lady Apples lying: around,
but there Is no call now for this fruit.

there are but few on the market.

CORN â The local market continues dull, of
ferings meeting with little attention on account
of the high prlces.~ The Chicago market is
lower, and apparently losing strength, Bnd the
movement from the farms is Increasing. Pri
vate Tsircs-froni"thÂ»re to Bolton, De Ruytfr &
Co.. said: "Piimary receipts, 531.000 bushels.
arainst 000,000 last year. , Shipments; 2fW.00O.
against 434.000.- Clearances, 15.000. Tone of
market was w^ek.' partly in sympathy with
decline 'In wheat,' but 'cash situation continues
unencouraglrg or moderately: fair receipts and
a poor -rash demand. Much of the.b<>st local
vuppcrt to ' the market has Â¦ abandoned it . and
country traders are thÂ« principal holders. The
tendency seems lower.". . 'â¢ .. ..

RYEâ Still higher and firmly held at SoQ
87Uc. ' ,
"If you have rain out West over Bunday
there will be a break. ThÂ» Government report
indicates crop- of 076,000,000, an. increase over
previous Â¦ estimate of- 49,000,000. It gives the
acreage of growing winter- . wheat'- crop Â¦ at
32,000.000 acres, an increase, of 4,000,000 acres
over the crop last harvest. As some increase
had been expected ' and as this estimate is not
as high as either the , Price Current 'or Snow,
it was not taken as being very bearish. I Mar
ket opened strong and sold up to 83%@84c.
The advance, Â¦ however, met with . heavy sell
ing both for Southwestern account, particularly
St. Louis, and for local professionals, much of
the latter I being; ehort wheat. While the ex
treme Southwest . reports .farmers still hold
ing tenaciously, country buyers report an In
creased ottering ' in the winter wheat sections
east of the - river and perhaps more wheat is
moving from warehouses at the extreme South
west. - No rain Is yet reported either In Cali
fornia or in . the extreme Southwest, but con
ditions eeem rather more favorable for it. The
general tone of market has undergone a change,
the volume of outside buying is hardly holding
its previous force and there is more of a
fighting disposition noticeable among local trad
ers on the short side. We rather . look for a
scalping market and think It ' will be equally
safe to sell, wheat on sharp bulges as to buy
it on eharp breaks."
In this market futures advanced about a cent,
but shipping grades stood the same.
