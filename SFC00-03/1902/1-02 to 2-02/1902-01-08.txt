Colombia and Venezuela.
BOGOTA, Colombia, Jan. 7.â "Venezuela
continues to help the" revolutionists,"
said Minister of War Concha to-day
"The revolution In the interior of this
country Is a Venezuelan affair. The sit
uation is unchanged, but we will have
more well-armed men on the frontier
Boon."
"How long do you think the revolution
yond which the revolutionists seen to
have escaped and gained an almost In
accessible mountain pass, where the hope
of overtaking them was lost.
General Antonio Fernandez, more fortu
nate, was able to offer successful resist
ance and he is now awaiting the arrival
of ammunition. Up to the present moment
the Government has conducted operations
with activity and intelligence and every
thing leads to the belief that when the
time of general struggle arrives the fight
ing will be severe. To deny the importance
of the revolutionary movement would
be fo!ly, for more than 90 per cent of the
population either directly or indirectly
take part in it. No one has yet been
recognized as the real chief. Report says
Senor Matos is, and Riera. Rolando, Ba
taille, Guerra, Monagas and . others ac
cept him or accept his ammunition and
arms, but after the victory . it may be
that be will not be recognized as Presi
dent Such is the opinion of the well Jn
formtd.
Partisans of General Hernandez refuse
to unite with Senor Matos and wait for
heaven-sent help to rise to power.
All the revolutionists living in Trinidadâ
and ttiey arc numerousâ embarked on De
eembtir IS for Martinique in order to join
Benor Matos.
Such is the exact stage of the Venezu
elan i-evolutlon. A Bhort time ago Castro
said: "The country is ungovernable.""' â¢

" The attempt of O'Neill and his support
ers to reopen the strife with the Employ
ers' Association was not successful..- Some
of the delegates expressed themselves in
ttror g language as being ready for an- â¢
other fight with the 'Employers' Associa
tion, but the majority of. the delegates
frowned down such, action and acted in a
carelul and judicious manner, despite the
eloquence of those thirsting for a fight.
Ed Rosenberg of the Sailors' Union ad
vised that no -unnecessary steps be taken
to irritate the business men of San Fran
cisco. He said the labor unions had taken
a delinite stand on the recent strike, arid
it was to the best interests of labor not to
change its present attitude.
Chairman Macarthur of the committee
on resolutions said that it was most im
politic to reopen the fight against the
Employers' Association. Â¦
T. E. Zant of Carpenters* Union No. 4S1
of San Francisco made a long speech sup
porting, the O'Neill resolution. ,
T. Westoby of the San Francisco City
Fron: Federation, favored the resolution,
and alleged that owing to the blacklist
he h8d been debarred from making a liv
ing since June 2 of last year, because the
Hisdcn Iron Works would not 1 allow him
to pass through their yards to reach ships
in [he basin. , â¢
"If the Employers' Association will not
let us alone, we won't let them alone."
said Westoby'. "Mayor Phelan told us
to resiort to the ballot box when we -asked
him to take the police off the trucks. We
did so and we elected our Mayor, and if
there I* to be a fight with the Employers'
Association we will not be afraid of them:
I am in favor' of peace, but we won our
previous fight against the Employers' As
sociation and can do so again."
Considerable time was taken up by dele
gates reciting their personal experiences
since the strike and a motion that such
speeches were out of order was upheld
by ths chairman. .
There was seme confusion in the con-
Mayor-elect -was made an honorary mem
ber o:! the federation and was escorted to
a seat on the platform next, to President
Rodgsrs. â¢ - Â¦Â¦â¢'
When business was resumed, the dele
gates proceeded to discuss the late strikes
in Saa Francisco. *
J. E. O'Neill of the Porters' and Pack
ers' Â£.nd Warehousemen's Union No." 88S5
of San, Francisco introduced a resolution,
condemning the Employers* Association
as ha.ving been responsible for the labor
troubles. The resolution charged that the
"association wantonly outraged American
workingmen and ruthlessly trampled on
their rights, and were enemies of "or
ganized labor." -It was charged' that the
association had resorted to - the blacklist
and coercion as principal means of at
tack, and the resolutions provided that a
committee be instructed by the conven
tion to take, steps to prosecute those of
the association who had violated the State
laws. ; -
The committee on resolutions reported
against; the adoption -of O'Neill's resolu
tion and recommended the following sub
stitute: ." , .' . . - . ': . Â¦ â¢-â¢â¢.-;/.";=-
TVhfTes*, Certain employers of the State are

Resolved, by the California State Federation
of Ls.bor that we denounce said practice and
pledgi; ourselves to the enforcement of the
anti-lilacklict law and in favor of the passage
by the coming Legislature of a measure which
shall remedy any defects which may appear in
the course of the effort to enforce said law.
VALLEJO, Jan- 7.â Just after the

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 7.â The following
letter was received to-day from Admiral
Schley in response to a letter conveying
resolutions adopted at a recent meeting
of the Army and Navy Club: '
WASHINGTON. Dec. 29. 1001.
I beg to acknowledge with Infinite gratitude
the resolutions of the Army and Navy Repub
lican League of Los Angeles. Cal., forwarded
in the club's name. I hold it a high honor to
merit the commendation of this distinguished
body of my fellow citizens, and I will hold
this tribute always near and dear to my heart.
Please^ thank the members of the club for the
honor they have done me and say ln my name
how sincerely I appreciate their action. Very
respectfully. WINFIELD S. SCHLET.
Schley Sends His Thanks.
Raynor stated that 'it will take some
time to prepare the appeal, and that It
will not be filed with the President until
after the return of Admiral Schley from
his visit to Havana, about the 20th inst, j
"Admiral Schley has concluded, after
mature and careful deliberation, to appeal
from the majority decision of the court of
Inquiry to the President of the United
States as commander ln chief of the army
and navy. The action having been deter
mined upon, nothing more can be dlvulgeJ
at this time, the regulations of the navy
being such that the nature of the pro
posed appeal cannot be revealed except
by the President after the formal docu
ments have been filed with him."
The Interview with the President was
arranged In advance, . and. at its concu
slon Admiral Schley left the White House
in a satisfied state of mind. He had been
given a full opportunity to present the
case from bis standpoint and to acquaint
the President with many details. While
Admiral Schley would not make any
statement regarding the matters d s
cuesed, holding that any interview be
tween a naval officer and his commander
in chief should be regarded as confiden
tial, it Is understood that he brought to
the President's attention many of the al
leged injustices and discrepancies of the
majority report of the court of Inquiry.
Admiral Schley's interview with the
President was the result of his determina
tion to exhaust every means in his power
10 overturn the Judgment which has been
rendered against him. His new appeal
will be different from that submitted to
the department, bringing out - some new
facts which hare an important bearing
upon the controversy. The fo lowing state
ment was given out by Admiral fecnley's
counsel at the conclusion of the confer
ence:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7.â The object. of
Admiral Schley's visit to the White House
yesterday was to request the. President to
entertain and consider an appeal for the
reversal of the action of Secretary Long
and the disapproval of the majority Judg
ment of the court of inquiry. The Inter
view was satisfactory,-, the President
granting the admiral's request, Messrs.
Raynor and Teague will to-day assist Ad

peal.

Briefly stated, the attempted consolidation of
railway- lines and properties of the Great
Northern and Northern -Pacific Railway com
panies, - which, was defeated in the case of
Pearsall ' versus -.The Great Northern 'Railway
Company, la now renewed by the united ac
tion of the holders of ' a majority of the stock
of each -of said companies, by placing a ma
jority . of the capital stock - of each of aald
railway 'Â¦ comnanles ln â¢ the Northern Securities
Company, in -order that the last named com
pany- rray manage and control, through ltd
president or ' executive ' committee, all of the
railway lines: and properties of each of said
railway companies. This action asrainst the
Northern Securities : Company is brought to
reach the Instrument - or means through , and
by which these -two railway companies are t to
be consolidated and involves an inquiry. Into
the extent of the powers of the Northern Se
curities Company and the lawfulness of Its act.
Or, ' stated : in a more direct form, the princi
pal ' question raised ln this action Is : Can a
corporation, organized under the- laws of New
Jersey, use Its corporate powers so as to vio
late or overthrow the constitutional enactment
of a lister State, and thus accomplish" in
directly that which, this court has held can
not be done directly, especially ln view of the
fact -that the New Jersey, corporation was or
ganized , for.? the ' express i purpose of ; accom
plishing this' result?
-Â¦â¢The further question is presented, vli. : Does
not the " consolidation -Â¦ of - these railway com
panies/ which own and operate all the railway
lines situate * ln . the northern . half of â¢ Minne
sota (except two short iron ore carriers) amount
to ; a Â¦ monopoly ln railroad traffic. â¢ and - Is â¢ not

" The second document filed In the United
States Supreme Court to-day by Attorney
General Douglass of Minnesota, in addi
tion to citing many . authorities bearing
on the right to institute ln this court,
briefly relates the State's . contentions . as
to the legal attitude of the railroad con
solidation, as follows:
file and present a bill of complaint on the
part of the State of Minnesota against the
Northern Securities Company." Chief Jus
tice Fuller asked if notice had been given
"to the Securities Company, and being in
formed in the negative said. there was no
rule requiring such notice. He added:
"We will: take the' papers."
Douglass, handed in his -bill of com
plaint and also a brief citing authorities.
The : Attorney General and his assistant
counsel, G. P. . Munn and G. P. Wilson,
then retired. .The -court took. the motion
under advisement, as is usual ln such
cases, - and will give its decision ln due

Porto Rico is now alarmed lest the naval

SAN. JUAN. Porto 'Rico. Jan. 7.â The
Porto Rican Legislative Assembly has
adopted " a' Joint resolution urging" the
establishment of a United , States naval
station in Porto Rlcan waters, and offer-
Ing to cede the possession of ' any prop
erty, buildings and appurtenances belong
ing to the Government of Porto Rico that
may be required and necessary for the
construction of a naval station, leaving
the adjustment of title thereto to subse
quent legislation. It is recommended that
all Porto Rican municipalities make simi
lar offers.
The policy of the insular government
has heretofore been to claim the lands,
the, titles of which were disputed by. the
federal and insular governments, hoping
to sell them to the Navy Department.

The Negaunee mine is one of the most
unlucky properties in the Lake Superior'
district. Much trouble ln sinking and
drifting has resulted from '. surplus water
and quicksands. It was at this mine that
$1,000,000 was recently expended to sink
a shaft to the ledge. jHUhmB
NEGAUNEE. Mich.. Jan. 7.â The most
distressing accident in this county for
years occurred at the Negaunee mine to
day at noon, when,, by. a cave-In, the
lives of probably seventeen miners are r
thought to have been lost. The cave-In
was at the bottom of the old shaft. Had
it occurred half an hour sooner about 150
men would have been killed. The names,
of the dead, so far as known, are:

It <> Is set up that the .- Northern Securities

Company, has changed, dictated and ' controlled

settled -policy; of .New Jersey to allow, the con
solidatlon of only such railroads as are or can
be connected' to form continuous lines. .and not
to permit the consolidation of parallel or com-'
petlng i lines.' Â¦ The, oratrtx, claiming ; tb * have

Injury to the State.
..In furtherance of the plan to evade the laws
of Minnesota It - was agreed that, pending the
delivery of the stock to the Northern Securities
Companyi it chould all be turned over to J. J.
Hill, or be under his control.- - The Northern
Securities Company, It is charged, does not in
tend to purchase this stock, but simply: to issue
Its own stock in exchange therefor. -For these
unlawful purposes the company Is about to re
ceive, unless enjoined therefrom, all the capital
stock of the Great Northern and Northern Pa-.
cine. This, it ib claimed, Is part of a plan of
Hill, Morgan and. their associates whereby the
two systems are to be consolidated and* placed
under the direction of one man or board of di
rectors, . through the defendant company, and
thus bring about and perpetuate a monopoly ln
railway traffic in Minnesota and a complete
consolidation of the two systems. One man or
board will thus. It Is alleged, be enabled to fix
all rates on lines of the State, determine what
trains, shall be run, remove all competition and
prevent the building- of lines Into new country
or Into : competitive territory. . y' - ... . â¢ â¢
This â¢ agreement and the consummation I there
of is "claimed to be "in restraint of trade,
against Â¦ public policy and.vold.". Under Its
terms ' the directory of the , Northern * Securities
Company may change ' Its own ' rules or may
delegate all Its authority to an executive com-'
mittee. It Is pointed out that Hill, the pres
ident, Â¦ W. P. .'dough; the vice president, and
E. T. Nichols, the treasurer and secretary of
the company, were all, at the date of its or
ganization/ officers of the Great Northern, and
that a ; majority of ' Its â¢ directors ; were also di
rectors .of ; the Northern Pacific.'' It has been
the policy of the State to prohibit consolidation
of parallel or competing lines, and the law of
1874, , ln which such prohibition is made, is
quoted In-full, as . well as^ the amplifying act
of 1881 and. the anti-trust law of 1899, prohib
iting any combination In restraint of trade.
Evasion of State Laws.
' The complaint alleges that the rates on j
the Immense shipments of . wheat and Â¦â¢ other
merchandise over the. lines of the two com
panies have baen lower 'than they -will be un
der any.. arrangement' which' contemplates unity
of; control." The'.bill' then recites the charters
and incorporations- under -â¢ which â¢Â¦ the Great
"Northern operates over' CuO miles of road and
cites the clause in Its . charter', providing: that
Its,, affairs are to be conducted by a boardj of !
directors, . which is to do Â¦ all things necessary
"and not inconsistent *Â¦ with the-, constitution'
and laws. of the United States or the laws of
this terr'.torf . or this act.'.' - It Â¦ is further al
leged ' that James J. : Hill holds â¢. a controlling
| interest "in ; the $125,000,000 of' capital stock.' 1
\ Â¦ The history and charters of the Northern Pa
cific] are similarly 'rated, special attention be-.
Ing paid- to the roads acquired and built with
in' the -State.- By. filing Its articles : of Incor
poration in Wisconsin .with, the Minnesota au
thorities,': the 'Northern . Pacific became sub
ject to all the laws,: regulations and provls- !
ions of Minnesota. The facts 'as to the present ;
personnel of â¢ the Â¦ directory, . the- insolvency of
the old company and its reorganization in 1893
and th^ purchase : of the < St. Paul and Duluth

They are also, with one exception,' the only

control, was obtained by the two systems

dent and present director, belnjt a director in

Taking up the Northern Securities Company,'
It is set forth that it was organized by James
J. Hill, W. P. Clough,-'J. Plerpont Morgan and
"other associates . to .. the oratorlx unknown,"
who, at the time, - were Â«ontlnually ln confer
ence over means by which., the laws of Minne
sota might be .. successfully â¢ evaded . or avoided,
and that it was so organized solely for the pur
pose of effecting a consolidation of the Great'
Northern and Northern Pacific. The owners of a
large majority of the stock of the two systems
had agreed beforehand to transfer to the new
company seventy-five per cent of the stock ! of
the two, systems on terms which are set forth
in full and to retire the preferred , stock of the
Northern Pacific.
Provisions of Charters.
It is ; next set up that the State ex
pends more than $700,000 annually* ln tho
operation and maintenance of its . educa
tional, , charitable â¢ and ;_ other public - insti
tutions; that this is' mostly raised by di
rect taxation; that the amount .which can
be raised and the successful maintenance
of these institutions for the benefit of its
citizens depend 'largely -on : the ''-.value ' of
the real and personal property Â¦within the
State, which in turn depends ' largely on
free railroad competition. It has been tho
settled policy of â¢ the . State to . encourage
railroad. building by grants of land, and
in- this way over 10,500,000 acres have been
granted, 'nearly Â¦ all ' of which .. has - been
granted to the Great Northern and the

Is effected these roads will cease to build

Ninety Per Cent of It Really
Caused From Poor Digestion.
Real organic heart trouble is Incurable, but
scarcely one case ln a hundred is organic.
The action of the heart and stomach are both
controlled by the same great nerves, the sympa-
thetic and pneuipogastrlc, and when the stom-
ach falls to properly digest the food and It lW
in the stomach fermenting, gases are formed'
which distend the organ, causing pressure on
the heart and lungs. causlnK palpitation "Ir-
regularity and shortness of breath. Â¦
The danger from this condition is. that the
continued disturbance of the heart sooner or
later may cause real organic heart trouble and
ln fact frequently does so. â¢ . --/;Â¦.
Furthermore, poor digestion makes the blood
thin and watery and deficient Jn red corpuscles,
anc this further Irritates and weakens the
heart.
The most sensible thing to do for ' heart
trouble- Is to insure the digestion and assimila-
tion of the food. . ... :
This can be done by the regular use after
meals of some safe, pleasant and Â¦ effective " dl-
ireBtlve preparation, like Stuart's L>yspepsla
Tablets, which may be found at most ' drug
stores und which contain the necessary* diges-
tive elements in a pleasant, convenient form.
Thousands of people keep well and Â¦ vigorous
by keeping their digestion perfect by observing
the rule of taking one or two of these tablets
after each meal, or at least after each hearty
meal. . . â¢ ' . -,-Â¦
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contain* U. S. P.
pepcln, diastase from malt and other natural
digestives which act only on the food, digesting
It perfectly and preventing acidity, gases and
the many diseased conditions which accompany
a' weak stomach. Â¦
Â¦When Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are used
you man know you are not taking Into the sys-
tem any strong medicine or powerful drug:, but
elmply the natural digestive elements which
every weak stomach lacks. Â¦
Â¦ So widely known and popular have these tab-
lets become that they are now sold - by every
druggist In the United States, Canada and Great
Britain. â¢ 'd=SÂ»SS!8sK*=:- ; .

late last night from Chief of Police North 1

Fowler then frankly confessed his mis
doing and told of past crimes which
proved a great surprise to Dawsonites,
as he had been very popular. He con
fessed repeated thefts from numerous em
ployers in the past, many of Â¦ which had
been followed by punishment. He was
liberated from the penitentiary of Mas
sachusetts after a- four years' term just
before going to Dawson. - ......
Fowler's thefts from Chisholm. of which
the" latter was unaware previous to the
confession, proved to have aggregated
about' $100 daily for a fortnight or more.
SEATTLE. Jan. 7.â Henry Ml Fowler
took laudanum , with suicidal iutent in
Dawson on December 23. i He had been
bookkeeper for Thomas Chisholm and

drawn "up at the : sides .of , ! the station.

driven the engine which drew the special

When. the. Emperor, and Dowager -Em

sion . halted and ' their â¢ Majesties . alighted
from their chairs, * which ; were covered
with imperial 'yellow silk and lined with
sables, . the Emperor proceeded to ..Â¦Â¦ the
Temple of the God of War, on the west
side of the plaza; with hundreds of for
eigners peering down I only â¢ forty feet
above him. ; and ! dozens of Â¦ cameras Â¦ were
focused upon the Son of Heaven. When
he returned his chair was borne through
the gate. Then the chair of the Dowager
Empress, was brought to the doorway of
the Temple of the Goddess of Mercy. 1 on
the east side of the plaza, and the Dow
ager Empress, appeared." Amid a I great
scuffling of attendants. she proceeded into
the temple on the. arms of two officials,
followed -by a : company of Buddhist
priests bearing offerings. The spectators
then heard the booming of the temple bell;
After, an intervalÂ«of five minutes the
Dowager Empress reappeared. Standing
In 1 the doorway of the temple she looked
upward. Directly, overhead were the Ger
man Minister, Dr. Mumm Schwarzenstein,
the secretaries of; the -German- Legation,
the officers and ladies-from the American
garrison - and . the ; mrrespondent of the
Associated | Press. > r i ae Dowager Empress
saw the foreigners and bowed low. . She
advanced a few. steps and bowed again In
acknowledgment of the salutations of the
foreigners. ,j She" , 'returned 'Â¦ to : her j' chair,
looking-, upward the/tfemicirele of for
eign faces and bowing repeatedly. ' ...Â»
In the, meantime the: Chinese soldiers,
Manchu bannermen : and minor, officials
who â¢ had- crowded the plaza were rever
ently-kneeling.- ' The two -arches at * the
sides of the ancient gateway, framed hun
dreds of faces of coolies, who;
emboldened by the presence of foreigners,
ventured to gaze' upon .their rulers;- This
incident Â¦ constituted . a" most-- sharp - con
trast- with the old > regime, when : neither
diplomats nor natives were * permitted to

Visit to the Temple.
This ] re : entrance. of '. the : Emperor into
the capital was the most remarkable epi
sode inUhe' annals of the dynasty,' save
the flight of .the Chinese court when Pe
king was bombarded by the allied' forces.
The spectacular phases exceeded expecta
tions.- The , cortege a was a sort of glorified
Lord show and was a bewilder
ing barbaric exhibition . o*f Oriental â¢ tin
seied splendor. Its chief significance was
the complete effacement of the traditional
deification of Chinese royalty. The for
eigners I were given Â° greater - facilities ; for
witnessing the ceremonial - than would
have been; afforded them at Â¦ most Euro
pean courts. .
The scene at the Chiang, gate -when the
Emperor, and the ! Dowager Empress en
tered the temple to offer thanks for their
safe journey was nothing less than revo
lutionary when viewed in the light of all
Chinese customs. The ~. horseshoe wall

with I Europeans, diplomats, army officers,

ADVERTISEMENTS.
A Most Remarkable Remedy. That
Quickly Restores Lost Vigor
to Men.
A Free Trial Paekagra Sent by Mail
to All Who Write.
Free trial packages of a most remark-
able remedy are being mailed to all who
will write to the State Medical Institute
They cured so many men who had battled
for years against the mental and phvsical
suffering of lost manhood that the Insti-
tute has decided to distribute . free trial
packages to all who write. It is a home
treatment, and all men who suffer from
any form of sexual weakness resulting
from youthful folly, premature loss of
strength and memory, weak back, varico-
cele or emaciation of 'parts can now cure
themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving: strength
and development Just where it is needed.
It cures all the Ills and troubles that come
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute success in
all cases. A request to the State Medical
Institute. 228 , Elektron building, Fort
Wayne. Ind.. stating that you desire one
of their free trial packages, will be com-
plied with promptly. The Institute is de-
sirous of reaching that great class of men
â¢who are unable to leave . home to be
treated, and the free samples will enable
them to see how easy it is to be cured of
sexual weakness when . the proper reme-
dies are employed.* The Institute makes
no restrictions. Any man who writes will
be sent a free sample, . carefully sealed in
a plain package, so that its recipient need
have no - fear of "embarrassment or pub-
licity. Readers are requested 'to write
without delay. - ; ;

CONTRACTED DISORDERS.
UNDER THB TREATMENT FTJRStnEO BB-
fore irrigations were established. Â«tx week*
waa deemed tha duration of an acutÂ« contracted
disorder. If it proceeded beyond fix weelw it
was considered to have gone into a chroma
condition. From statistics compiled from our
practice in the past nve years, covering over
4500 cases, -we can show that Â»0 per cent of our
patients have recovered in fourteen days or
less. It is therefore, equally proper to hold
that a case not entirely cured within ' two
weeks must be considered a chronic - one, and .
some complication has arisen for which thÂ«
patient should see a specialist- We Invite freÂ»
consultation on this subject and offer an ex-
perience of over twenty yeara: in fact, we can
positively assert that we have never failed: to
cure: in a single Instance.
All Varicoccles Should Be Cured
Varlcocele Is an enlargement of the moat
Â¦rital blood vessels In " man. Â¦ The function of
these veins is to carry off waste, thus enabling
the or?ana to receive fresh nutrition. The dis-
ease consists of a dilation and local stagnation
of blood, from which the organs are deprived
of their proper quantity and quality of. nour-
ishment. Varlcocele Is a very common dis-
order. Â¦ Statistics show that 25 per cent of the .
male population are afflicted with < some stage
of the disease. We emphatically guarantee to
cure -varlcocele in one -week at our office, or
four weeks of home treatment. We. have cured
over 3000 case's without a single failure or un-
pleasant - result. We mean by a cure, re-
establlshment of nutrition of the organ, and Its
function will be restored. We have shown thia
result so often and can refer to so many cases
in proof of this statement that we make it
without . hesitation or reserve. We invite cor-
respondence and the fullest investigation of
our methods.'

The steamer Eureka, which was re
ported to hav<* narrowly escaped disaster
on the Kumboidt bar on Sunday after
noon, arrived from Eureka yesterday.
Captan G. M. Jessen. master of the ves
sel, explains that the story of a possible
Fhfpwreck was without foundation. The
Eureka, when crossing the bar and
twinging into the harbor, broke her
wheel rope. Immediately the vessel was
backed to a jxsint -where her steering
pear could be repaired. It required less
than aa hour to adjust the new rope, and
the bar was crossed without the slight
est difficulty. The accident was of so
trivial a character that the passengers
en board knew nothing of it.
Eureka's Trouble Exaggerated.

It. was a clear night and the sea was' smooth.
The San Bias struck ; the: rock at ' 11 o f clock : at
nipht. -Just after the passengers had' retired to
thrlr ' berths. 1 â¢ The Â«hip niurt 'have struck - the
rock amidships" and the; water* : came pouring
into the ensine rooms with terrific 'force. "" 'Aa
soon as. the ship struck all the electric lights
went out. and I had great difficulty in getting
up on deck.. As, soon as I discovered what the
trouble was' 1 returned to- my. stateroom and
secured mymoney and a life preserver.- â¢-. -. â¢Â¦ n
At firbt there was a little panic, but Captain
Cattarinich went around Â« and told everybody
that there was no- danger.' .The women ;were
*ll' lowered* Into boats, -but "they" were :- after
ward brought back and everybody remained on
board the San Bias that night. .r - r .Â¦
-In the morning we were all taken In rowboats
to Acajutla and well looked after. I cannot
give enough praise to the captain and his offi
cers and crew.for the way they acted.- "\
Paul Jesurun" says that he took*pas
sage on the steamship at La- Libertad and
had only been on board two i.ours when
the accident occurred. He said also: .-
Story of a Passenger.
At the time of the aceldent Captain Cattari
nich was. on, the bridge" with Second Officer 'J.
W. Ramsey.^ ' .- â¢-Â¦ r Â¦.>. _.-Â¦:.
The boats were hailed and all hands, with
the exception of the sailors in . charge of the
beats, were safely put aboard the wrecked ves
t-el, the boats being . kept alongside and ready
in case of urgent need, i At daybreak, after an
anxious wait, the boats were again laden with
the passengers and. In procession rowed toward
La Libertad, through a heavy.' tossing. > stub
burn sea: The pulling taxed the strength of
tho sailors and upon (heir arrival at the port
they were almost exhausted.- ,. â¢ ' ;
. The sea. was rolling high. : breaking over the
vessel, and it was not -without difficulty that
the p&ssengers were transferred to the boats,
the sailors, however, by command of the cap
tain, keeping .close by the ship. Soundings
were then taken, and upon finding that thc ves
sel was secure on the rocks Caotain Cattarlnich
decided that it would be safer to take the pas
sengers on board again until daybreak, as the
night was dark and a. heavy mÂ»a running.
It was 7 o'clock at night when we left Aca
jutla. and at 11 o'clock, owing to a heavy mist
and Captain Cattarlnich mistaking some fisher
men's lights on the btach five mtles north of
La L-Ibertad. the 'ship was run ashore about
four miles irom that port. She grounded on
the rocks and. the whole bottom of the vessel
was ripped out. At the time the San Bias was
running at full speed. Immediately she filled
with water up to the main deck, and' to ad-1
to . the seriousness of .' the situation all " lights
went out within. a minute after she struck. â¢ E
Purser R. C. Morton has a great deal to
say in praise of his fellow officers and all
who were connected with .- the Â¦ San Bias.
His story Is as follows:;. ' â¢
Vessels Bottom Ripped Out.
We . were = many miles below Remedlos when
the San Bias ran on -the ..headland.; There
was -.some excuse for the - catastrophe, as ' we
were In a 'tog and the" ship was under 'a 'clow
bell. Cautaln Cattarinlch : did everything In his
jioivtr to a>ave the ship. -but she struck a rock
and hung: there."' When v I Â¦. last, saw, her she
was hanging as on a Â¦ prvot and was owinglng
back and' forth with -. the â¢ tide.*" The ! bottom
was completely torn â¢ out , of .' her and â¢ I should
judge- she was a complete ' wreck.' - .
- She carried a crew of sixty and had sixty
â¢passengers.. Of. these not a soul was tost.
Nearly . all - were landed In the boats, but the
captain, and crew stayed ; by the; ship. -'Â¦. Thsy
were still there -when we passed the ' wreck ' on
our way -home on the Newport. , " .
- The San Bias was on her way ' to Pan
ama, when' she ran ashore on a: reef near
Acajutla., Everything " possible was ' done
to save the vessel,", but Â¦ without- avail.
She was hard and fast on the rocks when
last seen and her decks were awasn. The
people who came up; on the Newport say
she is a. total loss and that all' her cargo
Is now at the bottom. Â¦ of Â¦ the Â¦" ocean or
strewn along'the beach., ,* -
Thomas, .Dunn * was v formerly â¢ a pay
master's clerk on the United' States gun
boat Concord.. He went to Panama on
thu San Jose after the i wreck and there
boarded the Newport: He said: ;
The Paplflc'* Mail â¢ Steamship -Company's
Newport^ arrived fronv Panama and way

brought up; were .the 'purser,:: the first as

writers and 20 per cent was paid on
>ht chances. Captain Tonkin reports that
he left the niiratc ports October 19 last
and encountered variable winds until
January 1. Then he ran Into a gale and
the ship was hove to under lower topsails.
There was a heavy storm of rain and hall
for hours -and at times the bow of the
ship could not be seen from the bridge.
The voyage of the Pharos Is not con
sidered a particularly long one. but owing
to the fact that nitrate Is in demand and
that the bark had 15.886 sacks of It
aboard the insurance people were anxious.
Among the ov^rdues on which the. re
insurance men are now gambling Is the
Norwegian ship Prince Louis, now out
ninety-six days from Newcastle, Aus
tralia, for Honolulu, and on which 20 per
cent is being paid : ine British bark
Forthbank, out eighty-nine days from
Newcastle. Australia, for San Francisco,
and on which 10 per cent is being paid:
the Robert Duncan, out ninety-nine days
from Wei-Hal-Wei to Puget Sound, and
on which 90 per <*:nt Is being paid, and
the Blackbraes, out 12? days from Table
Bay for Portland, and on which 15 per
cent is being paid.
THE British bark Pharos arrived
from Iquique yesterday after a

If Botha be fighting by reason of any such* hope as
that he is ; doomed to /disappointment. Â¦ . Rosebery's
speech at Chesterfield, which has rallied around'him
the great bulk of, the Liberal party, holds out no
promise of granting: -independence to" the South
African ; states. He declared emphatically for a prb
gramme of action which would begin by offering
terms to thfe Boers; provided 1 they would'accept Â¦ the
sovereignty of Great Britain,- and upon their failure
to accept would 'follow with a vigorous- prosecution
of the struggle, ] In oj;her words' Rosebery-.;con
demned the Salisbury Ministry not so much' for its

policy, but with greater vigor and effectiveness.
grant terms quite, different from unconditional sur
render, while'; the Boers are determined â¢ to hold- out
for independence, or at least for better % terms than
the present Ministry will grant." 'V
It is significant that the report of the instructions
sent to the commandos by General 'Botha goes on to
say that he urges as an inducement for continued re
sistance at this timethat the. Ministry will /soon have
to ask Parliament" for another war loan and possibly
additional taxes,, and that the chances are; the British
public? will demand"a cessation of the war. It would
seem . from this" that Botha is fighting, now mainly ; in
the hope that the British will displace the Salisbury
Ministry, and that the anti-war party will attain "suf/
ficient power to; force the incoming 7 Ministry to con
cede a large. measure of self-government to the Boers,
if their full independence be r not* frankly recognized.
GENERAL BOTHA is reported to have sent a
note to all the Boer commandos requesting
them to keep on fighting. ' This may be taken
as confirmation of a previous report that General
Kitchener has opened with the Boer leaders informal
negotiations- for peace.' It appears, therefore, that
the British are eager for peace and are willing to

Nj doubt if we had Government railways the ship
1-crs and travelers would expect a very cheap ser
vice, unreasonably below the cost of administration,
and the difference would .fall upon the taxpayers in
the shape .o # f a. tax.
It seems difficult for people to feel otherwise in
regard to any utility that is run by Government.'
They carry over to it the habit formed in the enjoy
ment of scKool facilities, and the protection of the
Police and Fire departments. These arc paid for in
their taxes, and the citizen does not have to put up.
any other fee for the use of the schools, a policeman
or fireman. Their use costs him money, however,
and he seldom sees such a balance-sheet as informs
him of the exact amount. When the Government
goes into business he will naturally expect its service
as he thinks he gets schools, policemen and firemen,
for nothing, and in the lack of information upon the
cost the service is quite likely to cost him more than
when rendered by. private parties.
We hear constantly of the cheapness of telegraphy
in England. The service is cheap as compared with
ours, by distance and price per word transmitted. But
the. annual deficit should be added to. the price
charged for use of the wires, and when this is done a
part- of the margin between English rates and ours
disappears. When the wages paid arc compared it
will further appear that the user of the British lines
enjoys- part of his service at the expense of the â¢em
ployes.
. The postal telegraph is felt as a burden by the
British Government, because, being a public concern,
the people expect its use for as "near nothing as pos
sible. .
â¢The Chancellor says that the people arc eager for
rapid communication, but averse to paying a rate
that will return the cost of operation, which has had
to be made up as a deficit by taxation.
. The latter is the largest governmental system of
telegraphy in the world, and is naturally pointed to
as an example by those who favor state socialism.
Our American system is much more extensive and
uses many times as much mileage, and, of course,
much longer lines. The distances to be covered by
wire in the British Isles are no more than the mileage
of California would be if it had to serve the same
density of population. But the vast extent, of our
domain demands the use of the : largest wire system
in the world, with an expense naturally -greater than
any other. The financial experience of England in
operating her postal lines is not taken into account
nor referred to by the- proponents of an American
system of postal telegraphy. The last report on the
British telegraph, by Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, Chan
cellor of the Exchequer, shows that the lines are
operated at an annual loss of $3,500,000. a deficit that
now amounts to $40,000,000 since the Government
took over the lines.
*~p*HERE is considerable vigor in the movement
1 for Government telegraphy in this country. It
â¢*â¢ is stated â not upon his authority, however â
that Postmaster General Payne is in favor of a postal
telegraph modeled on the English system.

Professor' Julius Rodenberg, on tht
other hand, believes the author ought tc
be able to bequeath his ; creations to his
descendants without any.; restriction, es
pecially, as r in .many instances the remu
neration he receives â¢ is : no equivalent foi
hid labor. There are cases. in; every lit
erature in which the works of the authoi
have not met ' general recognition unti
many years after his death. ;
Herr Heinrich Seldel, the novelist, agair
declares that permanent copyright woulc
be neither right nor Just.
Dr. Ernst von "Wildenbruch, the drama
tist and novelist, â¢ says. "In my opinior
It is, impossible ['Â¦ from .the Â¦ standpoint" ol
right and Justice to pronounce" the prop
eryt rights of the author in his works tc
be ' otherwise . than inextinguishable.". â¢
"Dr.: Max" Halbe, theV'dramatist, holds
that . literary ' as other . property should bt
treated purely from the material . stand
point.' Professor Karl Frenzel holds thai
copyright secured to an author for life
and to his heirs for a ~ period 6f* thirty
years after his death, appears to coincide
with all Â¦ reasonable claims and interests
alike of the author and of the public. .
-'Â¦Â¦ Dr. Ludwig Fulda holds the opinion that
in future property rights will not be rec
ognized as permanent and inextinguish
able at all," but that for the commor
good the la-wa of inheritance will be re
stricted, as It 13 neither moral nor usefu
that \ distant descendants should acquire
the right .to live in idleness.
Dr. Paul Heyse, the poet and novelist,
says:. "It is true property in the products
of the intellect is in principle the same as
that in Â¦ material possessions. It should
consequently descend in the way of inher
itance to the most distant successors ol
the owner/'
Georges Ohnet, the novelist, says: "ThÂ»
clay that legislation recognizes that liter
ary property is . property like any . othe;
will give. simple justice. The tastes of th<
public and the admiration of reader
alone will fix the duration of copy
right." Â¦
Authors Are Divided in Opinion.
Jean Rameau, a member of Societe de:
Gens de Lettres, says: V Literar y prop
erty will soon be recognized -for all time.
I /ail to see why in effect one should not
be as much . master of : the products ol
one's brain as of those of one's hand."
The Morning Post then proceeds to give
the views of leading Frenchmen and Ger
mans, a few of whose* opinions may. be
quoted. Alfred Mezieres, a member of
the French Academy and "president of the
Parisian Journalists'- Asociation, saysr
"It seems to me to be easy to fix the dif
ference between ordinary property and lit
erary property. Not One of us has any
right over what a neighbor holds by her
itage or by acquisition, but. literary work
belongs to a certain extent to humanity.
He who wrote it owes Inevitably some
thing to predecessors and* the time comes
when he ought to render to those who
succeed him service such as has been ren
dered to himself. He certainly thus only
pays as a debt to humanity part oC luat
which he has received." '.
In this connection it cannot be said that
the act of Congress has given satisfaction
to English authors. The copyright laws
of most countries show three changes
original perpetuity, then a short term of
protection, and finally a longer term of
protection. The tendency seems to be to
make this still longer. Thus. In France
a hundred years ago the term was for ten
years after the author's death. Now it Is
fifty. â¢ Probably the present century will
see important changes* in England as
elsewhere. Â¦ . â¢ - â¢ Â»
Tendency Toward Longer Period.
The subject of the law of copyright In
books is discussed at some length by a
great many distinguished Continental au
thors in the Morning Post. So far as Eng
land is concerned, the subject has been
thrashed out by the Authors' Society,
Â¦which recommends an author to make his
own terms with a publisher^ The principle
which thia codhtry has preferred is- that
the author jshould receive a royalty on
each coj?y sold, the amount of the royalty
being-, of course, proportionate in some
way to the price of the copies. â¢
As to the law of copyright, like- many
other " departments of English enactment,
it is in a state of bewildering confusion,
statute being recklessly piled upon
statute. -
Though of course it is . well enough
known that copyright in books lasts for
forty-two years after the author's death,
Francis Watt, an authority on the mat
ter, in an article on "The Law of Copy
right in England," says no one wants to
make the. term less than now, but many
plead for a more or less prolonged exten
sion.

It is as" certain as anything in the future can be that
the great ranches of the valley must sooner or later
give Â¦ place to a more intensive system of : agriculture.
The valley, is rich enough to sustain a population^ as
densej as; that or* Belgium, and' with far. greater : com
fort-atfall seasons of the year. "Those facts should
be -made known in the East, whence most of. otir
settlers come.. The. purposed exhibition at St. Louis
will of course, tend to. that end, arid :it ought to be
made .upon a scale â¢ commensurate - with its impor
tance. , ' \ . . ,Â¦.:--.
" When allis said and done, however, the , welfare of
the valley^ counties , will depend mainly upon the
energy and progressive spirit of ;their own people.
It is upon them^ rests the duty of making known, to
the world. the' land. they have to offer to settlers,- the
resources .that will repay large investments," the
goods they.:have to offer inthe markets of the^world,'
and the manifold attractions of climate, scenery and
soil which /furnish! inducements for tourists and for
those who desire rural homes for recreation" as much
as for-profit. . â¢
In his report to the Departmentof Agriculture on.
irrigation . problems in California Professor Mead
pointed out that while in many parts of State ir
rigation is not necessary, it is everywhere beneficial.
The statement is particularly true of the San Joaquin.
Moreover, the mountain streams which supply water
for irrigation would. also supply. power for generating
electrical energy, which could be transmitted at: but
little cost to the cities for manufacturing purposes.
Thus every, form of industry, whether -of town or
country,- promises to be benefited. by the undertaking
of those great: irrigation enterprises in which it is
now probable the. United States Government .will it
self set an example to the States and to private cor
porations. 'Â¦' ) ;
It is not likely, however, that' the old order; of
things will continue, much longer, undisturbed. > The
very call for a. meeting of representatives of ail the
valley counties to combine' for a grand exhibit at St. Â¦
Louis is a proof that^a new impulse is stirring among
the people.. That impulse would under any circum
stances start a new movement of enterprise, but it
will have the better effect from, the" fact that it co-'
incides , with ' othTer movements of the time, each of
which will be helpful. to the valley.,; The first of these
is the tendency ' of â¢ industry "and commerce
westward by reason of the developments ex
pected ; around the Pacific Ocean, and the sec
ond is the . deep ..interest now : . taken in irri^
gation. The westward movement i.wiU{. benefit all
California, .but ; the- adoptionVof better irrigation , laws
and.the' nejv interest'which is taken in the cultivation
of the ' soif . by the aid of irrigation will : be ' particu
larly beneficial "to the great :valley where water can
be applied to land under well nigh ideal conditions. ' .'
Like other i sections of Northern California, . the
countfes lying in the San Joaquin>Valley have never
been thoroughly, advertised. .The richness of the .soil,
the mildness, of -the climate at all seasons, the variety
of the products that can be profitably cultivated,
have never been made known to the people of the
East as fully as they should be. "The consequence is
that: while Southern California receives a stream of
tourists and settlers or investors the Sanjoaquin re
mains comparatively' stationary.' /
REPRESENTATIVES of the^SanJoaquin Val
ley counties ar e to hold a meeting at 'Fresno
on Saturday; for jjthe purpose of devising pre
liminary plans for exhibiting the* resources'and''in
dustries of the valley at the coming; exposition at St
Louis. Though the; date; of the exposition, is as yet
distant, it is- none too early for the Â° work proposed
for the Fresno meeting;- No section of California is
at this time. more in need of a thorough exploitation
of its advantages, and in none would such exploita
tion be more profitably repaid. /

PERSONAL MENTION.
And they may take further comfort too from the factthat
France has'a law similar to one enacted by our Congress,' that
went into effect four years and a half ago, which makes it
imperative for each ship in a collision to stand by the other.
The closing words of Uhe first section of this act axe these:
Tf hÂ» ( the master) falls so to do â i. e., stand by and render all
~..Vihir a<!<:istance to the other vessel â and no reasonable cause for

Tt will from thi3 showing, probably appear to some minds
that the Walla Walla was solely to blame. But I certainly
â¢^iH not advise any such hasty conclusion, even though the*
would not aavise ay decidedly against that vessel.

It is, of course, urged that the bark had no signal lights
displayed, but only those on deck at the time can possibly
know anything about that. Such a shock as there was at the
moment of "the collision . would more than possibly have put
any oil lights that the Max carried out of business. If it can
be shown; however, that she had no lights. Article 29 of the
regulations h&s^a saving clause which those Interested in the
steamship will doubtless take advantage of. It reads:
Provided, nothing In these rules shall exonerate any vessel â¢ â¢ â¢
from the consequences of any neglect to carry lights or signals.
The engineer on watch insists that he received no orders to
alter the speed of the Walla Walla until at the moment of
the collision the "stop**- bell -was sounded.
Every : steam vessel which Is directed by these rules to keep ant
of the way of another vessel shall, on approaching her. If necessary,
slacken ' her speed, er stop, or reverse.
Walla obeyed that rule. And to go still further Article 23
says: \
ANSWERS TO QUERIES/
'.-. When a â¢ steam vessel. and a sailing , vessel are proceeding in such
directions as to_ Involve risk of collision- the steam vessel shall keep
out of , the -way "of the.satlinp vessel.
That in -itself is clear enough, but see what follows: Article
21 reads: V â¢'" f;." ;
V -Where by any of -these rules one of. two vessels is required ta
keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed.

that he did, and i his statement stands, - not alone uncontra
dieted, but it is . supported by members of the crew of the
Walla Walla. -But even this is not all. Article. 22 of the regu

Correspondent Seeks -to Show That Regulations for Preventing Collisions
The only criticism of it is the adoption of Spanish
names for the coins. Peso and centavo will never
look natural under our shield and flag. . We are pro
ceeding upon the'thebry that the islands and their in
habitants are, to be Americanized. To that end we
have sent hundreds of American teachers there armed
with textbooks in the English language. They are
laboriously teaching Tagals, Moros, Visayans and
the whole museum of tribes to think in English. To
do this they must be. diverted from, two languages,
their tribal tongue \pd Spanish. The saying that
"money talks" is quite true^nd the money of the
Philippines should talk United States. Everybody
handles money. -The half-cent coins = will, be in^the
handy of the school children. Every inscription
upon them should be in English. This would be
one means of making them; learn, our language.
They would all want to know what the words on the
money meant, and would learn them. We believe
that other countries with colonies put on one side
of colonial coins their own language, . and on the
other the language of the people. Even this is better
than the proposed Spanish name of the Philippine
coins. Why Spanish? Spain has no longer anything
to do with the archipelago. She left, nothing there
but her language and the memory of her oppres
sions. Why perpetuate the memory of 60th by
stamping if in metal and compelling the people, to
handle it?
The. financial theory of the plan is correct. It ex
tends the principle of our gold standard and secures
the same stability which that standard establishes at
home. It prevents such a draft on our domestic 1 cir
culation as- would be caused by the extension of our
own forms of currency to the islands. It establishes
a local reserve fund for redemption and par pur
poses, so that our continental reserve of gold will
bear no new burdens. . .
.The War Department appointed a special Com
missioner to visit Manila and, after investigation, to
report upon, a means of reform.*
The report of this Commissioner ; has ; been made
and awaits the action of Congress. The Commis-.
sioner finds that the use of silver has become a
fixed habit of the people, and therefore the new cur
rency should be silver, and recommends a distinctive
coin in that metal, to be legal tender for 50 cents in
the gold standard- of the United States. It is to be
known as the peso, and will contain 25 grammes of
silver of the fineness of 0.835, and be divisible into
100 equal parts, called centavos. It will be issued by ;
the government of the Philippine Islands in such
quantities as trade may require,, to be determined by
such government. It will be maintained at its par
value in gold by a gold reserve, derived from the
Â¦seigniorage of the coinage of the silver bullion used.
The Mexican' dollar and all other coins now in use
there will cease to be legal tender, at a fixed date, and
the new coins;at their gold value will be the sole
legal tender for public and private obligations. The
new coinage will be executed in the Manila mint and
will bear distinctive devices.
In 1897 Spain issued a special Filipino peso, con
taining less silver than.the Mexican dollar, and there
fore not liable to flow out of the country. The fall
in the gold value of silver has caused a rapid rise in
prices and a much slower advance in wages, to the
injury 'of labor. This system of inflating a currency
by reducing its purchasing power was the favorite
resort of the Stuart Kings, which left the English
currency. in such disorder at the accession of 'William
III. It has hampered trade and'exchange in the isl
ands, and the time has come when it must bevreme
died. Â¦:":Â¦ >^:a^vV '
As the, value of silver fluctuated, however, it
it proved to be' an~ unstable. -coin, being exported and
imported according to glut or scarcity of it in the
near-by countries of Asia.
When all ! the Spanish colonies were united under
one flag and commercial policy the Mexican silver
dollar became the money, of; the Philippines, as it is
largely the money dfaccount for a great part of Asia.
IN' the midst of war's alarms in 'the Philippines
the business of the islands is found to require . a
specialform of currency,, based on the gold-stan
dard of the United States. ." * "

near ' the Chutes entrance on the morn

As presiding Judge all the cases filed in the
courts will have -. to pass through* my hands,
and to bring them before me a Â¦ man will be
kept busy going to, and from the City Hall,
where, the County Clerk's office is located.
Besides, attorneys who want orders and stipu
lations of various kinds will be 'Â¦ put to .the
inconvenience :of . coming to the Hall : of Jus
tice. For these reasons , I will wait upon
the new building committee at Its , first meet
ing and see what '. arrangements can be â¢ made
to have Judge Lawlor and myself transferred
to the City Hall, so that all ;the Superior
Courts will.be under one roof. Some of the
Justices' Courts could be transferred to -tne
Hall of Justice. There Is t another point I
forgot- to '. mention: An attorney in a cape
before Judge Lawlor. or â¢ myself may : refer, to
a certain decision, ; and there is no means of
finding out Its .- correctness excepting through
the Law Library at the City Hall. The Dis
trict Attorney's office can remain in the Hall
of Justice or it Â¦ can ". be removed to , the City
Hall. It 'is immaterial. ;".
There is no other city In the Union where
the higher Â¦ criminal courts are in â¢ the same
building â¢ with the Police : Courts. , There are
certain influences that militate against " the
proper administration of justice. Just think
of : the v number ' of cases tried since we have
been in the Hall of ' Justice where .there have
been either acquittals, disagreements or com
promise verdicts. 'â¢ The men who hang . around
the Police I Courts hang around our courts and
when a jury r leaves court < for ' luncheon these
men make remarks in favor - of the defendant
In. a loud voice, -so that they can be heard by
the jurors; . I do not say. that they directly
taU , to Jurors, â¢ but their, remarks in the man
ner I state is equally; as- bad.. -â¢, ;"- -, â¢Â¦â¢ â¢'
The ; Judge . will also " endeavor to. have
his > court transferred to the City Hall,
and he will also use his influence to have
Judge Lawlbr- removed there. On this
subject he said: Â¦Â¦-.: -,- â¢ . . Â» iÂ» . Â¦ : " ,. ."'
-.It Is my - Intention '. to at > once relieve the
congestion- that ..has existed ; in ; departments
one and two by assigning cases in these courts
to other courts. All the business, both civil
and criminal, ..will be as equally distributed
as : possible among the : twelve , courts. . There
.will ,?be i no criminal,' > civil or = probate courts.
The * law Â¦ does ? not recognize Â¦ such a division
and the ; distinction ; has- come Into . vogue â¢ only
through usage. -; The State has provided twelve
Judges to . try anything t that comes before
them, > and *Â¦ while . I am in : office the theory
upon which the . courts are Â¦ organized will 'Â¦ be
followed . out as - far as possible. : ,
Judge Carroll Cook, who was elected

stated, after the cup had been admired,
that he proposed to break i through the

thus "Jnitiating" the goblet that never
had anything in it before, had it '.'passed'!,
from one companion to the other with the
request that he "raise" it to his, lips. This
play on a ceremony of the fraternity was
well received and loudly applauded. : J,

Loving Cup Is Duly "Initiated.'/
Si Franklin H. Day, San Francisco, Cal.â Dear
Sir and : Brother : . The : undersigned members
of Hawaiian Lodge No. 21, F. ' and A. M.,
duly appreciating your generous devotion, to
the best interests of the lodge as its honored
representative near the most worshipful . Grand
Lodge of California, and your untiring efforts
to practically illustrate to its individual . mem
bers when visiting San Francisco the true im
port of Masanic. fraternal* regard, now ' ask
you to acceat from them, as a token of : such
appreciation this loving cup. which : they have
selected fis, in* their . judgment, . the most
fitting symbol to convey- to you the sentiments
they would express.. And they trust you may
long retain tli is token as an evidence of their
unfailins regard. . The â¢ cud symbolizes the
genial srood-fellowshiD Hvhich should ever at
tend ' the brethren in their hours of refresh
ment and , of Â¦ whicH Kood-fellowship -you have
ever been. an earnest ami willing, contributor;
the pure silver from which it Â¦ Is ; fashioned Â¦ Is
typical of the pure and disinterested friend
ship for which you have made us deeply, your
debtor; its generous . betokens that
generous heart from which flows so often un
stinted measure of- the milk, -yea, the very
wine of lluman kindness, and its triple handles
may - they : ever â¢ be a reminder that we are
bound to you by the Â¦ three fold '.tie of genial
companionship, high esteem and brotherly love.
We approach with some diffidence a refererice
to Â¦ the material - : of which these- handles are
composed. . We know ; that for you they -will
never suggest the horns of a" dilemma, but we
have faith . to believe that they Â¦ will represent
to you something; more "endeering," and we
trust that you will find them firm supporters
when from the cud itself you and those you
love best would auaff the horn of Joy.
A sumptuous supper was then served
in Â¦ the banquet hall, where covers were
laid for three hundred. '.There . were Â¦ no
set teasts, but the high priest, John Ben
nett, who presided, -called on many:, of
those present for remarks appropriate to
the occasion. After . the cafe noir Frank
lin H. Day. presented to the gaze of those
present a large silver loving cup, with
handles of. deer's, prongs. The. cup was
sent, to him with the following letter on
his _seventy ; flfth birthday: . \ : .
HONOLULU, rerrltory of Hawaii.
Tribute of Love From Hawaii.
Upon the conclusion of the ceremony
there was presented, to the retiring high
priest, R." N. -Carson, a magnificent sil
ver table service /'in .a' neat oak -case,
bearing, on the lid a silver plate, appro
priately inscribed. The presentation ,was
in recognition of his valuable services to
the chapter -while Agoing from station

the presentation of -a. costly gold match

Between 250. and 300-^members of the
Royal Arch degree of \ Masonry assembled
in the' Chapter. Hall " of ; the Masonic Tem
ple last night to witness the installation
of - the new. officers ;of .California Chapter
No. 5, R. A. M.l-The very, impressive cere
mony, "of ; this branch : of :the , fraternity,
was conductedin an able 'mariner by; re
tiring Most -Excellent High Priest Robert
N. Carson, assisted by. Past ;High' Priest
Harry. Baehr as '. master of ceremonies.
The, new. officers are:-
John ': Bennett. M. E. ' h;gh priest ; G. Knight

William J. Smith, treasurer; Franklin H. Day,

On the second ballot Fontana changed
his .vote to Fay, giving the latter nine.
Comte then said that he realized that Be
han could not be elected, so he voted for
Fay, all of which was in the programme,
giving Fay the necessary ten. votes. Box
ton voted for Ryan and Reed changed his
vote to Fay for. the purpose of giving no
tice of reconsideration. The Mayor ruled
that a resolution to appoint a. clerk could
not be reconsidered after Braunhart
raised the point of, order.
"Your point- of order seems to be -well
taken," said the Mayor, and hÂ«j joined in
the laugh that followed. , ;.
"I make- the point," "said Reed, "that
your Honor cannot pass on this matter,
and that it is only in the province of your
successor, who will preside at the next
meeting."'" ..â -â¢
Brandenstein advised that Reed could
appeal from the decision of the chair, but
realized that it .was hopeless.
Later in the meeting Fay appeared, and
â¢having qualified assumed the duties . of
his position. .. : â¢
For â¢ Ryan â Reed â 1
First ballot: For Fayâ Braunhart, Connor,
Curtis, D'Ancona, Jennings, McCarthy, Staf
ford and Tobin â 8. 'Â¦â¢Â¦
-.For -Behan â Booth, Brandenstein, Comte,
Dwyer, Â¦ Fontana and Wilson â 6. ' .
The greatest breach of civil service doctrine
would be the election of Mr. Fay, a man who
has no qualification in the line of experience
for the- place. - Why is . the board in session
to-day? Simply to prevent the . succeeding
board ; from j appointing its Â¦ own clerk. ' The
only reason for - electing one njan Is that . he
is the satrap of . a political boss, -who repre
sents a certain faction, and that he can make
a political slate without . breaking . it. John
A. Russell â¢ taught V his subordinates their
duties,' but subordinates will teach their su
rerior . his duty if Fay is elected. ' _ . .
The vote was then put, with the follow
ing result: Â¦ Â¦
Connor nominated Fay and Dwyer per
formed a similar service for John A. Be
han: In nominating John Ryan, Reed
made a plea for his election on the ground
that it would comply with civil service
provisions, he-havinsj .been an assistant
clerk for, twenty years. He said: '
Reed raised the point of order that the
rules required a regular routine, and that
the election of a clerk should come under
the head of public business or be consid
ered immediately, but under suspension of
the rules. ~- Prompted by his chief, Braun
hart moved that the board proceed to the
election of a clerk. Reed alone voted no,
and nominations were declared In order.
The proceedings of the Board of Super
visors were enlivened yesterday by a spir
r ited \ contest^ ever the election '"of a suc
cessor, to the late John A. Russell. Charlca
\V. Fay, i the Mayor's private secretary,
was closely, pressed for the place by John
A. Behan, but secured the plum, receiving
the bare ten votes necessary to " elect.
This was only accomplished after some
effective campaigning done with the Su
pervisors as late as midnight on Monday.
I I Mayor Phelan lost no 'time in springing
the , job to - secure a soft 1 ' berth for his
man. No sooner had- the minutes been
read than Phelan said:
"We might as well at this time as at any
other, proceed -to the election of a clerk.

W^E are not in business. for our health; neither are Market-street concerns which ad- ; Â«
S " vertise Roxbury carpets at 75c per jjard. People go into business to make a profit, â¢ Â«
g but the amount of profit asked by different stores'is almost entirely governed by the Â§
a running expenses of the respective stores. Our enormous establishment, with its facilities 8
S for handling large quantities of trade with the least possible^ expense, is enabled [ to ;un- g
S dersell any downtown stores from 10. to 20 per cent. Our rent account has never ; â¢ Â§
> I amounted to 1 per cent of our sales, and it is not a matter of^uesSWOrk when we af^ |
5 firm that the average rent account of a Market-street furniture store ; should fully 8
g reach 7 per cent. Here is a saving in our favor in rent alone on a- business of $500,000 vS
o â¢ a year of $30,000. Does it stand to reason that a store thus handicapped can sell goods â¢ ' '..':â¢'.Â«

g CTILL there are other items of unavoidable expense unknown to us, but only too i
0 well known to the downtown business f men, whichall help to raise v the running ex- 1 8
g pense of a Market-street Furniture Store to enormous proportions/and make' it quite g
Â§ impossible for them to compete with "off Stores." ." ;. ' *

Â«â¢ is absolutely the best in the city; in fact, our workshop is .a regular training school, 8

Â§ pur salesmen, and by these very concerns we are being daily accused of poor work- ' Â§

COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.â Generally
cloudy weather has prevailed during the week,
with heavy fogs and rain in the central and
northern sections. The days have been some
what waimer than during thÂ« preceding week'
but the nights have been cool and frosty. Very
little rain has fallen in the southern counties
since early in December, and grain and feed
are showing the lack of moisture. In the cen
tral and northern districts early grain is in
excellent condition and pasturage continues
abundant. Plowing and seeding are prorrets
ing except on the very dry lands. , In Sonoma
County the grain acreage will be larger than
usual, fctock are doing welL Tree and vine
planting are progressing.
â¢ Â£AN JOAOXTN VALLEY.â The weather has
been generally cool and cloudy during tbe week
becoming somewhat warmer toward the close'
Heavy fogs nave prevailed in some sections
Rain has fallen in- portions of the valley In
eome piaces sufficient to benefit grain 'and
grass, while In most of the southern districts
there was only a trace.- Heavy frosts have oc
curred in many places. . The cool, dry weather
is having an injurious effect on grain and pas
turage, especially in the southern districts and
retarding plowing and seeding, in the more
northern sections, however, where ' the ' rain
fall naÂ» been more abundant, grain is in very
good condition and farm work is progressing
Vine and tree pruning continue, and vineyards
and orchards are in good condition. .
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.â Warm, dry
weather has prevailed during the week great
ly to the detriment of early sown grain pas
turage and orchardg. Farmers and orchard lsts

SACRAMENTO VALLEY. â The severe north
erly winds toward the close of December were
lullowed ty heavy rain on the 1st of January
and warmer weather toward the close of th>
wtok. Very little damage wae done by thÂ»
drying winds, and the rain came in ample
time to Bolten the soli for cultivation and re
vi\e erain and green feed. Plowing and seed
ing are progressing satisfactorily, and in some
I'laees. the grain acreage will be larger than
that of last tseasun. Eaily grain is in cx
â¢ ceilent condition. Pasturage it- abundant and
â¢uoek are doing well. Orchards and vineyards
are in good condition. Pruning is nearly com
pleted. ' ;
Late reports lrom the southern citrus fruit
districts indicate that considerable damage was
acre by the severe "Santa Ana" of December
1:7, one corresi>ondent in Orange County re
torting that in some orchards the loss on
oranges will be nearly "one-third. Tnere are no
rurtr.er reports of damage by frost. Orchards
and vineyards are generally in good condition
and pruning is in progress. All available
water is bang used for irrigation in the south.
E2riy sown grain ccnt<nues in excellent con
dition in most places nurth of the Tehachapi,
tut is needing ram badly In the southern dib
tiicts. lireen feed was not Berioutsly damaged
by the frc*ts oÂ£ December, and is still abundant
txctj.it in the eouth. Stock are in good eon
aitiuiL. flowing and heeding are pn.gressins
In all sections, though slowly on the cry
lanuts in me tsautnern districts. In portions
of the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys
Â£.n<J in some ot tbe northern coast counties the
ptain. acreage will be considerably more than
that c! last stascn.
The cold, frosty weather, with drying north
erly winds,, which prevailed during the last
â¢weeks of December, was followed by more
moderate tem:>crature and rain in. the central
and northern parts of the State and unusually
warm and dry weather In Southern California.
Heavy fogs liave prevailed along the coast and
in the fcacramento and San Joaquin valleys.

NEW YORK, Jan. 7. â The stock market be
came decidedly reactionary to-day. There was
the same contest during the morning as there
was yesterday between the faction working for
an advance and the reactionists. United States
Steel stocks ' were etill the rallying point for
the bulls and were dealt in to an enormous ex
tent. The rest of the market kept slipping
away, however, and gained momentum on the
downward grade. The bulls were alert to
avail themselves of every opportunity of creat
ing any sympathetic strength by impressive ad
vances in individual stocks. No such effective
factor came to their aid as the unexpected in
crease in the New Jersey dividend yesterday
.and the market closed active and easy at about
the lowest of the day. There was a bull
demonstration in Sugar in the midst of the
session, which carried It up 4 points. The
movement was apparently based on the active
agitation in behalf of Cuban reciprocity and
the entry of Cuban eugar free of duty. Amal
gamated Copper was notably firm on the rally
in the raw copper market in London. Both
of these stocks yielded, however, before the
close. There was a rather palpable effort to
induce a transfer of speculation into the In
dustrials, while the railroads were sold to take
profits. The United States Steel stocks were
made the leaders on the strength of the gen
eral expectaion that a very favorable showing
of earnings would be made at the meeting"
of directors to-day, which was not held how
ever, until after the market had closed. The
extreme advance in the common stock only
reached iÂ» and In the preferred % when they
began to suffer, in common with the rest of
the list, from profit-taking Bales. The com
mon stock was carried * 1U under last night
and the preferred a point. ,With this develop
ment the reactionary tendency of the market
j was practically uncontested. The stocks of the
! various express companies made notable ad
vances, reaching 10 points ( in American Ex
press and 8% in United States Express,- with
no other cause than the recent extra dividend
disbursements and . very large business. The
inclination to sen stocks seemed to be based
upon general considerations of distrust of the
money outlook and of the present high level
of â¢ prices. Confidence in an early abundance
of mqney is becoming impaired with the con
viction that considerable gold will go out soon
to help the foreign markets in preparation for
the flotation of. the expected new British war
loan and a large Russian loan which is im
minent in Paris. The retirement of circulation
by the national banks attracts the attention.
The continuing problem of the Government's
surplus is seen ,to have growing importance
with the diminution of the available supply
of Government bonds for redemption, and the
financial world looks with some interest to the
inauguration of the new treasury administra
tion in this connection. The activity of in
terior, trade may also - delay the usual reflux
of funds. There was frank discussion of the
current reports of loans by New York banks on
Crude Rubber securities. This addition to the
troubles of industrial combinations recently
disclosed helped to repress the' Speculation and
especially to discourage the efforts to lead It
into that class of securities. Net losses- cf
between 1 and 3 points are quite general
among promlnent^tocks.-
The bond market was affected by the weak
ness of Etocks. Total sales, par ' value,
Government bonds were- all unchanged on the
last call. ' â¢ - ; .

A delightful hop at Angel Island last
evening was attended by a goodly num
ber of pleasure seekers. Most of the Pre
sidio officers who "trip the light fantas

of the affair and lent their presence.
Many of the guests were San Francisco
people and among them were several of
the most popular debutantes of the sea
son. A special tug conveyed the guests
to the island and returned to the city at
midnight. The Informality of the affair
added to the pleasure of the evening and

obligations and responslbllles as mothers
of the nation.

held by the members of the California

the Young' Men's Christian Association
building.. The subject- of erecting a club
house was discussed and an opportunity
given '.to members to contribute; ! It r was
suggested that $10,000 \ would be . a l fair
amount to raise for the purpose and as
$6000 was . quickly subscribed vthe'pros
pects are good for the balance .being se
cured from members who have not yet
been heard from. The members of the
California Club greatly feel the need of
a clubhouse. of their own. and as the la
dles of the' organization are known to be.
progressive in thought , and aggressive in
action in their most practical work a
permanent home is bound to be forthcom
ing.
Delegates were elected to represent the

Works he bad 550 In his pocket. When
searched at the hospital not a cent was
found on Mm. Lieutenant Anderson de
tailed three men, and Corporal Shanahan
of the Poirero Station detailed two offi
cers to find Moss* assailants.
The unfortunate man had left the works
and was txossing Scotch Hill when as
saulted. Eye-witnesses claim that a dozen
men jumped him and beat* him -terribly.
Moss was barely able to reach his home
He staggered along, bleeding profusely
from the deep cuts in his head, and when
he reached his doorway he fell uncon
scious. A neighbor telephoned the Sev
enteenth-street Police Station and the pa
trol wagon was used in removing him to
the hospital.
Moss is one of the newcomers at the
shipyards, and it is believed that the men
displaced wreaked their nre upon him.
He is now lying in an unconscious condi
tion at the City and County Hospital. He
is suffering from a possible fracture of
the skull and body bruises.

Most ot' the day was taken up in argu
ment for a dismissal, it being contended
by the defense that no specific crime was
charged and that the complaint was in
sufficient. The court denied the motion
to dismiss. There was some sharp re
partee between the attorneys.
Franklin Hichborn. the complainant,
"was the f.rsst witness. He denied posi
tively tnat he had written the article or
knew who the author was. He was a
willing witness and Delmas was unable to
check his explanations. He scored State
Senator Oneal and declared thai the part
of the article declaring Oneal a moral
young man was "an infernal lie." Hich
born said that as far as he knew the
article v.a:s partly true. He was on the
sianu at adjournment.
Among the witnesses summoned are
many proin:nent "grang" and "anti-gang"
i:<-pub!icaii:: and tne examination prom
ises to be i ">i of the most interesting ever
held here. E. fi. Cothran is counsel for
Newteirv, and D. M. Delmas for Hich
born.
General Otis and Andrews have been
brought here as witnesses and the gen
trai is chafing under the delay. He
warned to return to Los Angeles to-night,
Lui it now looks as though he will have
to slay here several days.
The charge of libel grows out of a re
pdrt by Captain Ntwberry on the publi
cation In the Los Angeles Times on Scp
umber 3 o* an article which styled San
Jose "the Sodom of the Pacific Coast."
S*r. Jose was declared to be worse than
Philadelphia. It was stated that corrup

chair and through all the city depart
ments. Mayor Martin pent Captain New

oi the author ot the article. Newberry
reported th;lt General Otis and City Edi
tor Andrews of the Times told him that
liicliborn had written the article. The
report was read before the Council.
Later Otis denied ever having made such
a statement to Newberry and liKewise
uenied that Hichborn had written the
article.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 7.â The preliminary ex
amination of Captain of Police Perry
Newberry. charged with criminal libel by
Franklin Hichborn. a newspaper reporter.
Ujan in Justice Wallace's court to-day
ait" attracted a large crowd of local poli
ticians. The political standing of both
principals added interest.
Â£Â»ecUJ Diaoatch to The Call.
Attorney Stewart then asked permission
of the court to quote law showing' that
, the attorney for : the prosecution had no
authority to offer the prisoner immunity
from punishment. The request was denied.
Morris said further that he had been. at
liberty to â¢ go where he pleased. when at
the Grand Central Hotel and that .Miller
had accompanied him at his own request.
Spencer here asked for time to make an
argument . against ; the admission of the
confession" of -this witness and > was al
lowed twenty minutes by the courtto pre-,
sent his case. ; Spencer asked the court .to
Instruct -. the witness i that the Â¦ . Attorney
General had no authority to promise him
freedom and also to instruct him that his
statement could - and ' probably ; would - be
'Â»used against him for. the purpose of con
victing him of the crime of murder.
Post, for- the* prosecution, .answered
briefly. The court denied the application
and ruled that Morris could testify. '< .-
Arthur Huston of Woodland, an attor
ney, .and. an. uncle of Claude 'Morris, ar-'
rived this afternoon. Whether he wiil as
sist the Â¦ defense or. the prosecution is not
known.. Recess was taken until "Wednes
day, when a full statement probably will
be made by. Morris. ;. ; : . ;. \
Is Permitted to Testify.
The witness said that he had spent a
part of â¢ the time of last week Â¦ at Beiber.
AVhen he was returning, by stage to Al
turas he wast taken -from the stage by
men .who Bald that John Hutton was be
ing held in the hall in-Alturas by a posse
and that they had come after him inor
der to protect him from the mob. He said
they took him to some house near the
Grand Central Hotel and afterward up
the back stairs into the hotel. On enter-
Ing the hotel he' first met Daniel Miller.
- He was taken at once into a room on
the second - floor, and later, accompanied
by his mother,, into Attorney Post's room.
In the room were Post, Boyd, Miller, Sim
mons and a number of others.. He was
then told that this was his last chance
that he could either, tell all he knew or
take the -consequences with the; rest of
them, which he understood to mean to go
to jail; that if he told, what he knew he
would not have to go to jail or be pun
ished by law. - He understood a crime like
this meant either to go to jail for life or,
be hanged. He denied that anybody told
him, what they wanted-. him to say. Sim
mons told him that he was sorry, for him
and that he did not look like a bad fellow.
He did ' not believe that Simmons :,was
trying to hypnotize him or use any undue
influence on him. Post and Boyd told the
witness -that they would stand in with
him and help him '.thro ugh' in this case,
and that the witness would not. have .to
go to jail. The witness said that - Post
told him that he had power to protect
him. His mother was in the room part of
the time and urged him. to, tell the truth.
Under, question he. swore to his: mother
that he did not know anything about this
affair, and repeatedly told her so,,: and
eaid he hopfed to drop dead if. he was not
telling the truth; which he did.
Morris said he was not compelled to
make his confession, but did it . to help
the prosecution.
No" Undue Influence Used.
Morris said that he : is 23 , years of age
and a resident of Lookout, having been
born there. He knew Calvin Hall, Frank
and James Hall, Martin Wilson and Dan
iel Yantis, who were hanged at Lookout.
Here the defense interposed an objection
to the testimony of this witness on the
ground -that he claimed to be one of those
who hanged- the five men;' that he had
confessed and that his confession , was
made within the last ' four days.' The
jury was ordered out of the courtroom.
Raker, for the defense, then said that
this witness had been compelled to make
a statement; that he did so involuntarily,
while he was imprisoned in a room In the
Grand Central Hotel, guarded, by Daniel
Miller. After an hour spent in argument,
the objection ; was overruled.. Raker then
asked that Rev. Mr. Simmons be brought
into the court,. but this was refused. Â¦ ,Dur
ing the argument Judge Harrington and
Raker called one another fighting men,
and Raker was taken out of the court
room by the Sheriff. He at once returned
and Attorney . Spencer began examining
Morris: Â¦'"Â¦â¢ : Â¦ -V -; : â¢ Â¦ . .,.?â¢;:.:,
Morris Comes Into Court.
Just before 12 o'clock Deputy Attorney
General Post announced that the prosecu
tion had only two more witnesses that
it wished to place on the = stand, and as
both were at that time before the Grand
Jury, he desired a continuance until 1:30
o'clock. These two witnesses were Claude
Morris and John Hutton, who have con
fessed. Morris came into the courthouse
at 1:30 o'clock, accompanied by General
Post and Daniel Miller. He was at. once
sworn and put on the stand. The court
room was crowded to 'the limit.
H. P. Read was . the only , witness exam
ined this morning. His testimony tended
to prove that -the lynching of the Halls
was "the result of a political feud, the old
"squaw man" and: his sons having, op
posed the faction that was in the majority
in. the mob that strung him up. â¢
Both the > prosecution and the ' defense
agreed tp the dismissal of many witnesses
this morning, , ' which is taken to mean
that the trial - of Brown is nearing its
end. It was said to-day that four lynch
ers were willing to make confessions pro
vided they were promised immunity from
punishment, and that, .their statements
probably would be ; in ; the hands . of â¢ the
prosecution within a -day or two/ .- -.
. ALTURAS, Jan. 7.â Claude c Morris, the
Lookout lyncher, whose confession has
implicated many men" In .the hanging of
Calvin : Hall, his three " sons and ',', Daniel
Yantis last May, was on the ' stand to
day as : a witness in the trial" of. James WV
Brown.. The defense- made^a determined
attempt to exclude the confession, and
testlmonyiof Morris,', on the ground that
they , were involuntary ; and were obtained
by stress of ; hypnotism and threats. " In
this Brown's lawyers were unsuccessful,
the " witness j saying that he had not ! been
coerced into making the confession. "~ The
defense attempted to frighten ;the you'rig
man by declaringthatlthe prosecution ob
tained his statement simply for the pur
pose of sending", him , to the gallows,' but;
though they succeeded in scaring him, he
would not retract what he had said.
Special DlsDatch to The. Call.
Now that the latter say that in what
ever form the plan Is introduced they will
withdraw, 'the friends' of the compulsory
plan: are all the -more 7 insistent to have
their convention introduced Into the con
ference concurrently : and on exactly the
same footing as the project by. which all
agree to adhere to The Hague convention.
If, they have their, way and the Chileans
carry out their threat the conference will
have to ; finish its labors without the
Chileans.
In making this statement the delegates
of Chile recall the conditions under which
Chile . accepted the invitation to the con
ference, viz. : That If any Â¦: attempt was
made to introduce 'into the conference
vexatious . questions for the purpose of
covertly or openly antagonizing Chile, the
delegates of that country would be with
drawn.
The object that the Mexican' delegation
and -W. I. Buchanan, the American mem
ber of the arbitration committee, have
been pursuing during recent negotiations
has been to find a method by which the
compulsory plan might be introduced so
as to satisfy. 'its advocates and at the
same time to avoid the separation of the
Chileans.
MEXICO CITY, Jan. 7.â The arbitration
situation has reached a crisis. To-day the
Central and South -Americans opposed to
the . Chileans held frequent meetings to
decide on .the form of procedure' under
which' they will introduce the arbitration
plan into the conference.. If they cannot
flnd a form acceptable to the other dele
gations they will probably withdraw. The
Chileans say that in .whatever form the
compulsory arbitration plan is reported
to the conference they will quit..
The Merchants* Association sent a com
munication to the board asking that the
licenses of those saloons adjacent to the
Presidio be revoked, in order to prevent
further disturbances in that section of the
city. The matter was taken under advise
ment.
Many permits to carry concealed weap
ons were granted citizens. Among those
who applied for the privilege were men
employed at the Union Iron Works. These
men claimed they were threatened with
bodily Injuries.- In granting the permits
Commissioner Xewha.ll said to each appli
cant:. "You understand that the commis
sion gives you permission to carry a pis
tol, but you are not to use It unless In
self-defense."
i Robert Roos was granted the privilege
of going armed. Lloyd Chrystal. a 18
year-old boy employed by the Vulcan
Iron Works, asked permission, but his aga
was against him. %.....
Henry Morton, the \ machinist â¢who vis
ited a saloon conducted by Jesse Marks
and tried to compel Barkeeper "Billy"
Ashznore to pick up a nickel at the point
of a pistol, had his permit to carry a con
cealed weapon revoked. ;
Special Officer Sauer, who ran amuck
in the Potrero a week ago, also had his
license revoked.
The Commissioners concluded that Swift
had . trifled with Miss Penebsky's affec
tions and therefore revoked his license.
Swift kept up with his cognomen by pro
posing marriage to Miss Gertrude Peneb
sky, a prepossessing young lady, who
lives at 286 Stevenson street. , He pressed
his suit and informed the lady that he
was a son of Sergeant Michael Joseph
Conboy. Miss Penebsky was a trifle sus
picious, and before giving her hand to the
special officer she had her mother call
upon Detective Robert Hogan In order to
secure proof of Swift' a paternity.
Hogan set his detective faculties at
work and by. clever deductions and inves
tigation discovered that Michael Joseph
Conboy had no son and that Swift was a
special police officer.
John* A. Swift is no longer a special po
lice officer. His license was revoked last
night by. the Board of Police Commission
ers because he practiced duplicity In an.
affair of the heart.'
The steamer Alice Gertrude, arriving
from Neah Bay today, reports .last night's
storm in the straits as being of great vio
lence, while off Cape Flatterv the wind al
most reached the velocity of a hurricane,

PORT TOWNSEND, Jan. .7.â The United
States revenue cutter Grant sailed . this
morning for an extended cruise along the
shores of the Straits of Juan de Fuca
and also along. the coast south of Cape
Flattery to examine the large quantities
of wreckage reported along the beach
during thfi past two weeks. It is believed
that many vessels have met disaster from
the continued gales which have prevailed
since December 25, as the Indians have
daily brought reports to Neah Bay of new
wreckage coming ashore south of Cape
Flattery. Captain Tozter of the Grant will
make a tour of investigation for the pur
pose of ascertaining if possible the names
of the unfortunate vessels.

. WASHINGTON. Jan. 7.â The first notes
of the contest-between the Nicaragua' and
Panama , v rputes for 'the . isthmian '.canal
,were heard in the Senate to-day. Morgan
of Alabama offered and secured the adoof'
tion of a resolution which indicated ..his
purpose to have the Committee on Inter
oceanic Canals inquire into ,the relations
alleged.', to' exist between the transconti
nental railroad "companies of the. United
States and Canada and the Panama Canal
Company.
In explanation of the resolution Morgan
declared that the alleged relations were a
"wicked monopoly," which already had
cost the people or the Pacific Coast;mil
lions of dollars. Xhe relations involve the
control by the Panama Canal Company of
the Panama Railroad Company and the
agreement existing between certain rail
roads of the United States and the Pacific
Alail Steamship Company. ; . - â¢ .;
-At the conclusion or business to-day the
Senate paid a graceful compliment to
Senator Foraker of Ohio by adjourning
until 2 o'clock to-morrow, in order that
Senators might attend the marriage of
Miss Foraker, which is to occur at noon
to-morrow,' without interfering with their
legislative duties.
The debate on the Nicaraguan canal bill
in the House was opened in lively fashion
to-day by > Hepburn, | chairman â¢ of I the In
terstate and Foreign Commerce Commit
tee,-, which reported the bill. For two
hours he held the floor, replying to a vol
ley of questions concerning the recent of
fer of the Panama Canal Company to sell
its property and franchises to the United
States for $40,000,000.
The interest in the debate centered, al
most entirely in this new phase of the
subject. Hepburn maintained that the
alleged new offer of the Panama Com-'
pany was part of the plan of delay. All
his utterances .along that line -were liber
ally applauded. He pointed' out what: he
claimed was the suspicious circumstance
that the Panama Company held out for
$109,000,000 until it was decided before the
holiday recess to consider the Nicaragua
bill, and then suddenly dropped the price
to $40,000,000.' . - Â¦ - - _ - . Â¦
Morris of Minnesota gave notice that at
the proper time he would, offer an amend
ment to authorize the- President, if he
could procure the property and. rights ' of
â¢the Panama Canal Company for $40,000,000,
if concessions could be procured from Co*
lombia and if the Walker Commission so
recommended, to purchase and proceed -to
complete the Panama canal.

The packing houses and their' repre
sentatives to whom ", rebates . were . paid
during 1901, according to Commissioner
Prouty,; will, if possible, be made amen
ablo.to a maximum fine of $3000 for every
violation of the law.* Regarding this phase
of the question, Commissioner 'Prouty
said:. . ; .
"I am heartily in favor of punishing
the ; packers , for, violations of the law, if
the* evidence proves sufficient, and I
think it will. 'Under .the law we cannot
punish the railroad men. who testified, for
their testimony â¢ absolves â¢ themselves and
they do not testify specifically against
any one else. All the punishment that we
can, if any, obtain against the' packers,
is in the .way of a fine not to exceed $5000

the Santa Fe; A. C. Bird, third vice presi
dent of the St. Paul; J. M. Johnson, third
vice . president of the - Rock' Island, and
other men of the" highest standing in the
railroad world took . the stand and stated
boldly that they are - now and had been
continual violators of the law, that they
are sick and- tired of being such, .that
present conditions . are ' intolerable, ' that
they arc powerless to secure a mainte
nance of rates, and that millions of dol

of legitimate revenue. . \

Greatest European Authority on Skin

The old Idea was that dandruff la scales
of skin thrown, off, through Â¦ a feverish
condition of the scalp, is exploded. Prof.
Unna, Hamburg, Germany, European au-
thority on skin diseases, says dandruff is
a germ disease. The germ burrows under
the scalp, throwing up little scales of cu-
ticle, and sapping the- vitality of the hair
at the root. The only halr # - preparation.
that kills dandruff germs ja Newbro'a

but stops falling hair and causes a lox-

ANOTHER Chance to Make Honest Money.
The Copper King Mining Syndicate has sixty-
five claims In the Carbon River district, north
of and near Mount Rainier. The mines of the
district are rich, assays showing $16 to |200
In copper and gold. 80 per cent of the values
being In copper. The company Is negotiating
for coal lands, with excellent prospects ot
securing a valuable tract Development worfc
is going briskly forward during the winter.
Machinery is to be installed early in the spring.
Engineer's report says: "The company plans
to make Its mines productive the first year."
Prices will be substantially advanced after the
first Issue of shares is placed. At the rrica
they offer honest speculation, tÂ» say the least,
with the chances strongly in favor of their
becoming, with early development' of thÂ« dis-
trict, a profitable holding to the buyer who is
not Impatient for early returns. Now Is tha
time to buy a block of these shares for a hand-
some proflt, which they will most surely yield.
The largest sales of these shares have been
made the past week to members of our ex- '
cursion to the Montezuma mines last summer.
This significant fact should not escape the In-
vestor who would place his money wisely.
Watch for our next excursion to Washington.
Par value of shares, $1 ; first issue being '
rapidly subscribed at 5c cash or 6c on easy
installments. Write now for preliminary pros-
pectus or neglect It and be sorry.

Big Travel to Coast Expected.
ST: LOUIS, Mo., Jan. 7.â Six masked
men entered the National Stock Yards
Bank, north of East St. Louis. 111., last
night- and 'after choking and gagging the
two night watchmen and the fireman at
the steam plant and blowing open the
vaults with dy ami te, secured $5000 in coin
and currency, with which they decamped
early. this morning.
From 7. o'clock last night until 4 a. m.
they -were at work on the vaults without
being Interfered " with. --The entire East
St. Louis police force; aided by .the, St.
Louis police, are guarding all the avenues
of . escape, but as yet have obtained . no
clew, to the whereabouts of the robbers,
who, it is believed, escaped on horseback.
Lee -Philpot, one of the watchmen, a
Rough Rider friend of President Roose
velt, - was standing near the . Exchange
building, in- which the bank Is located,
when, he was addressed by. three men,
who sprang from a fence ' corner with
revolvers In their hands. They said: "We
want. you. Philpot," and overpowered him
before he could reach his revolver. Tho
three, robbers took Philpot to th6 compos
ing-room of the Daily National Stock
Yards Reporter nearby and laid him on
the floor. He was bound hand, and foot
and gagged with towels. While lying;
there three other men cams in. Philpot
heard the leader of the gang say: "Let's
kill him." He waa deterred from doing
this';' Philpot says, by the other robbers.
Albert Estep, the other bank watchman,
was caught on the steps of the Exchange
building-. The - robber went up to Estep
and addressed him byname. Thinking It
wa3 a friend, Estep was taken unawares
arid when a revolver was thrust into hts
face was not in shape for defense. ,Vn
der threats of death he was forced to go
to the composing-room, where he waa
also bound and gagged. .
Night â¢ Fireman L. W. Clark was taken
unawares in the steam plant of the Ex
change building. He resisted and waa
badly- beaten with a sandbag'before-be
ing subdued. He was also taken to the
composing-room and left bound and
ga gged with his two ; companions.
About midnight ohe of the robbers was
left to guard the three captives, while the
other five went to the bank, which is lo

building, near the center. With nitro
glycerlo the robbers blew open the â¢ steel
doors of the vault. The big steel safe/
with quadruple plate doors, was next en
countered. The doors were drilled and. a
charge of the explosive Inserted, which
blew them off. The explosion destroyed
books and papers and scattered about $600
In gold and silver. *Thta money waa not
taken by the robbers. They took all the
other currency and coin, amounting" to
about $5000, as nearly as the bank officials
can estimate. The five men left the bank
and signaled to the one who was guard
ing the captive -watchmen and .fireman.
This man joined his companions. Â¦
In addition to the $5000 the robbers se
cured $550 left with the bank by Assist

loss of life would have;bâ¬en- BKiall. but for an
accident "which no amount of foresight could
have averted. Captain Hall tells me that he
cot al! the- passengers either in boats or rafts.
Just as- the Walla Walia was going down,
however, the steamer's foremast carried away,
fell acrcss. carslzed and smashed three heav
ily loaded rafts that were still alongside. Some
of the occupants must have been kltled by the
heavy stwr. all of them were thrown in the
water and many of them drowned. â¢. . r-
The boat-iwaln. who was in to-day, says
that the enly light he eÂ»w on the bark was a
â¢white light on the poop. When the Max struck
the Walla Walla her topgallant forecastle was
almost level with the bridge and both her
lighthouses were in plain view- while she re
mained. Both Captain Hall and the second
officer are certain there were no lishts in
either. Of course, the impact mieht have
Jarred them out, but that is hardly likely.
Johnson's story is V-orne out by the captain
and by Second Offlw r Lupp. both of ' whom
heard the order "Ha:J aport." It was hear
ing this order, in iact. that probably, saved
Capta)n Hall's life. He had turned in and was

AT the office of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company yesterday
E. Johnson, the hardy __ sailor
whÂ» was on lookout duty at the
bow of the Walla Walla when
the French bark Max crashed into her.
made a full statement of what he saw to
Ce.ptain Minor Gooda.ll.. Johnson's story
is full of interest and it disproves the
statement of Second Officer Chevalier, of
the Max, who says he saw the lookout
asleep at his post.
The officers of the Walla Walla say
that even on a moonlight night It would
be impossible for anybody aboard the
Frenchman to see whether or not a man
on any part of the steamer was asleep
or leaning, as Mate Chevalier says, on
the rail with his head resting on his arm.
Tlie lookout emphatically denies th?
charge of Mate Chevalier and the lattc.
still sticks to his statement. The eiiy: .
to lix the blame goes merrily on and t!Â£
until the Inspectors of hulls and baiK.
have made their investigation" will 4.-..
tL.il uutli be known.
From what I can gather from Captain: Hall,
the nleht , was ' clear,- that â¢ is, .' as far as seeing
lights was concerned, but beyond I that it" might
have just as well been foggy, so dense was the
darkness. It is possible that the bark' had her
lights , burning. Johnson . says he* thought he
saw one* when he hailed the 'bridge' just before
the, collision. It ia rossible that ; the'emokf
from the steamer obscured the. sailing vessel's
lights 'as far as our lookout and bridge otflcer
were' concerned. Ulti is impossible, 'however,
that the officer . In charge of the . Max .' could
have failed to see, the Walla, Walla.' Her -port
light was a IC-candle power electric.'llght,' and
the vessel's outline .was picked 1 out from. bridge
to stern with strong, white electric lights. He
must have seen the Walla WaUa plainly. as in
daylight.. He must - have known she was a
steamer;' must have had â¢ an Â¦ Idea as . to - her
length - end should . know how . fast - she j waa
traveling. He must -have: known*: that lt'iwas
impceslble for -her to clear his bow, 1 and 1 - al-;
casion to use his eyes â knows the inky-black
ness* of: the dark toward the west. I asked
Johnson partlcularlyâks to whether ' at .'any
time he saw the bark. . "Never a' sign of her,"
he says, "until she was aboard .of. us. 1 ' ' Â¦

and repugnant to the provisions of section

it is declared in the -State" constitutfon
that c the rates, of freight authorized, to be

Johnson says. The quartermaster swears
he did not- see the 1 Max until she was

the wheel "hard .over*.'- to avoid a colli

Ephralm â¢' Johnson, Â¦ a . seaman on - the
Walla Walla, who was.on duty as lookout
on: the' morning of the. collision,-, arrived
yesterday afternoon on the Eureka and is
now staying at 320 Drumm street. Johnson
is an intelligent f man but: very close-,
mouthed. :/ He : denied having .made any
statement for publication, and strenuous
ly declared that he had not admitted that
he , saw- the uMax bearing down on the
steamship."- He said he had refused to dis
cuss .the collision until he had made his
report to " his superiors. Â¦â¢ During the con

Searaan E. Johnson, who was on lookout duty
the morning of tjie wreck.- and the boatswain
reported to me this (morning soon . after . their

to prepare their reports for ths inspectors and
