JL / Ever since the revolution took
| %y place in the. theaters and \ men
and women alike experieaced the joy "of
delivery from that pestiferous nuisance,
the theater hatâ whose only friend was
the caricaturist and funny man â the ques
tion has been asked. "Why shouldn't wo
men take off their hats in church, too? 7
-The question, whispered at first by a
faltering few,- has been asked louder and
louder until it demands an answer.
And in the acfwering of what seems at
first a trivial question there has been
Uiore than one tempest in the ecciesiasti-
Ccli teapot.
Here ate some opinions gathered from
cltrfey ana laity:

It's a matter of indifference to me.

f.s poor people mxfcht feel humbied' lr^in
tne tact that, they nave not as g pud nats
to wear as their rich neighbors, it might

custom if an women would wear taiior

ciays, especially those vho tit farther up
In the cuurcn, eo that there wouid nut be
such a marked difference in costuming
between the iront and rear rows. One
might then feel that church-going. Instead
of being a social function, was indeed im
pelled by a real religious sentiment. --
It is tbe men who have taicen up this
matter of having the women remove their
hats, and while it Is true that men rule
the churches, women are the principal
patrons of the church, and if there is any
Question about it they should decide the
thing their own way. ' â¢ ' - Â¦
I don't care whether my congregation
wears hats or not. If a man is bound uo
in his subject, as he should be tp present
it. well, his mind will be so fully engaged
in the matter in hand that hÂ« will not
notice whether people's hats are on or oft
If he is ; Intense and Interested himself,
that matter should not enter la the least
Into his consideration or have any weight
with him. . .

There are two ' solutions to the problem
without taking oft hats. .If we wou.d
build our churches with sufficient pitch
to the floor so those in the rear could see
over the heads of people in front, that
would be one solution. And if wompn'n

both of the clergy aftd the laity as well. Here follows this decision, of
the Methodist church of Los Gatos: ' , . " i.

"Whereas, We believe that niany ; times many people who so at^
tend are. greatly. annoyed and inconvenienced by having their." viaw
of tho minister and of the pulpit obstructed by large and spreading
hats or bonnets, worn by those in front of them; believing that much
of the effect of a good sarmon, address or song is lost by not being
able to ricw the' speaker or singer j and ;/ â¢
"Whereas, The State has so far recognized the justice' of the
above as to have passed laws requiring 'all persons to remove their
headdress during all performances in places of .amusement /and in
all placps where public audiences arp wont to assemble; and ,

Whydidn't we hear this complaint years
ago? The old churches had no: incline to
. the floors at all.n It is a modern criticism
-a modern .'objection. L honestly think
there should be more of/a epirlt'of mod

li would distract them more from the ser
vice than to have them oil their- heads.
- ) n the theater the chief Interest is irr&ee
l.ig what you can see, but in church it
tiMjuld not be, but rather hearing what
you can hear. I think if people are in a
properly reverent moofi for church "ser
vice they will not think xnuab' about mil
linery. ;
â¢ No, even though the men of the church
objected to the women's hats, I should
hardly make the request, because it
would embarrass the ladies more than it
would help the men, It is simply a ques
tion whether the men should have their
minds distracted b* the hats or the
women their minds Â»dlstracted by taking
their hats off and holding them.
If the custom is. Introduced, audito
riums in future will have to be built twice
the size, so there will be room in the
pews to lay their hats.,
MB45. XOVELL WHITE.
It is a '. question of courtesy. If a
woman's hat obstructs any one's view
the courteous thing for her to do is to
take it off. Thougn we might also say a
man should take olf his head because he
is taller than the women and obstructs*
their view. Â« , .
A woman's hat is an Infamy anyway.
As- the Bramacharln said when here
a couple of years ago, we are but one
removed from the North American In
dian, what with our Â¦ feathers an<l
epangles and Jeweled. ornaments. But I
don't like the Idea of the men saying
' that women must take off their hats. If
women decide voluntarily to take off their
hats it is all right; otherwise they should
be allowed .to keep them on. , â¢ - (
I have a feelins of indignation whenrl
think of the position women occupy in,
the churches. They are good enough
when it comes to selling tickets, carrying
around subscription lists and other
pleasant work, but when It comes to hav
ing a voice in the councils of the church
or recognition in Its conventions, that la
different. In the early day the ' church
held that woman was an unholy, thins;
and even Jn my own girlhood days I re
member In the Presbyterian church . the
women were compelled toy , sit together
apart from the men. To-day, while woman
la the main support of the church, she Is
subject to man in all rulings of the
church; but I say if the question of re
moving hats is to be, decided, let It be
decided by the women themselves.
CHABLES HOLBROOK. ;#
1 am rather inclined to thÂ« Impression
that I would pursue the. old custom unless
women, wore such immense hats as to pre-.
vent people from seeing past them. The
hats in my church are very modest and I
have not been troubled by them. I ' be-"
lieve St. Paul says women should keep
their hats on.
What I have observed in the theater is
that ladies wear such large hats as . to
prevent any one's seeing past them; whlla
in church they go in different costumes.-
Another thing; the attendants at
church are largely old people whose, cus
tom it has been for thirty or forty years
to go with hats and bonnets on, and it
eeems rather harsh to ask. them to take
their hats off. I should hate to go to some
oged grandmother and ask her to take
off her bonnet, and I can't see that it
would serve any good purpose. You see
I am an old man myself, and I prefer to
stand by the old customs.
BEV. GEORGE C. ADAMS.
I think it is apt to become a fussy sort
of -matter, j Many ladies do not .like} to
take off hats or bonnets in a place like,
that. They arrange for it at the theater,
but not at church. In our own.ch.urdr
very few of the hats are objectionable in
Bize, and while we have a very large conv
pregationl do not feel that any one is
seriously inconvenienced by ladies wear
ing their hats.' Of course, where the
church is properly built, with sufficient
pitch to the fioor, there is no trouble of
this kind. ' â¢ -.-. ixri* V . .
If they are going to compel -Jadie's to
take off their hats they must have. a. room.
cf easy access where thÂ«y can go and
have a mirror to put them on: Blast.wo-
men want a looking-glass when they put'
on their hats and there^is a -nutaance
about that. It isn't like a roan's hat,
which he can stick on any way. . .
The dress of our. people is modest. We
Â¦ have millionaires in the audience, but you
could not pick them out. It seems to be"
an unwritten law among our pecple that
they will not come to church dressed in. a
foolish fashion., . Â¦Â»' "â¢ Â¦ 'â¢'Â¦-. ; ,
I have seen the question tried in. South
ern California/ where on account of the
warm Â¦Â¦ weather there is more reason for If
than yhere, and it always caused -som<5
feeling In the church, and I matle up my<
mind I would never ask the ladies in my j
church to take off their hat3. 1 think It is
rather cruel and I could not do it." ;/ââ¢
MBS. L.LOWEKBEEG.
It seems a trivial question at first
thought, yet it Is. one that must come In
for a share of consideration. When tjie
question was' first agitated in regard. to
taking off hats in the theater it seemed a-
Bhly thing to make a fuss about;. but now
that the custom is eatabilsned we wonder
how men and women, too, ever! were will-
Ing to be" subjected to the annoyance of
hats. ..." Â¦ Â¦â¢ â¢ Â¦ . .
As a matter of right. I think women
ehould take oft their' hata in church and'
tn any other assemblage where a hat ob
structs thewiew. AVa concert, for in
ftance, one feels often that some pleas
ure is lost if he cannot see the performer,
and it is the same at a lecture. or church
service. , *, li T '" '
On the other hand, it is. very Incon
venient for the women to hold their hats,
to say nothing of taking them qtt when:
they are securely pinned and held In place
{with a veil. Then, too.. there is tha ques
tion of getting them on straight. I don't
care much for dress and that sort of
thing, but I am fussy about having my
hat . on straight. Naturally a woman,
wants to look well when in a company ot
people, and having to take chances on
getting her hat on straight Is the worst
feature of the whole thing. However, 1
suppose it is a sacrifice women must
make in the interest of unselfishness.
W. H. MILLS. . V - . : . t
No well-bred person will knowingly
cause others inconvenience. If a woman
has a right to wear a big hat in church, a^
man has Just as good a right to raise an
umbrella. Women remove their hats In.
the theater, and I think we should be as
free from distraction and annoyance when
we go to the house t>f God to worship as
when we go to the theater.
DR. JACOB VOORSAWGER; ; .
_:1 decline to take the question seriously.
If men take their hats off why shouldn't
women? Of course a great deal depend*
upon the ventilation . of the churchâ the
women might catch cold.
>Ot . c *w rse you know there Is no telling
Â¦what the gentlemen , of ths synagogue 1
would say about this question, for in the
synagogue it is the ,cu3tom for men to
wear their hats; and by ths logic of con
ditions women ousht to keÂ«p their hat*
on, too.. â¢. - Â¦ .
Now, as a matter of fact, the service
in most churcbe3 dees not exceed an hour
and a half. The taking off of a bonnet |s
a. very cumbersome piece or business, and
for so short a time women should not be.
worried with taking off their bqrinets,:
thereby running the risk cf going oat
with bonnets awry. Perhaps some one
ought to invent some kind of a bonnet
that can be, removed without trouble;
then to prevent; the women from, taking
cold they could put on skull cans, as some
men do in church. Wouldn't that be
funny? It's a silly question, anyhow, but.
It the custom is to prevail the clergy haÂ»T
better be Instructed to put mirror* in the
anteroom so women can see that the v
get their hats on straight. '

yere element of lameness that a-way that
lets Peets out." As it is, he can run thirty

occurs in a splendid safety by. the breadth
of :a ha'r. It takes two hours to explain
to Old Coyote, that this episode is merely

sullen an' lonesome. An' a badger's feel-
in's is allers hurt about somethingâ an'
you never meeu> up with him when lie

Which it's the habit of these yere mo
rose badgers to spend a heap. of. their
time Bettin' half in an* half outen their
holes, considerln' the scenery in a.dis
satisfied way like they has some grudge ,
ag'inst it. An' if you approaches a bau

When you've come up within thirty feet
he changes his mind an' disappears back

he's a heap dark on badgcis that 'a-way.
An* also thar's a badger who lives clost to
Old Coyote's -dugout. One day whilethls
yere ill-tempereu anamile is cocked up in
the mouth of his hole, blinkin' hatefully
at surroundin* objects. Old Coyote cuis
uowii on him with a Sharpe's rifle he's got
Uickin' about his camp an' turns tnat
weeyon loose. <
"He missed the badger utter; but he
don't know it none. Comin' up to the hole
Old Coyote sees the badger; kindo' quilei
up at the first bend in tne burrow, an' he
exultin'ly allows he's piuggtd him, an*
tharupon reaches in a whoie lot to re
trieve his game. That's where Old Coyote
makes the mistake of his c'reer; that's
fchorely where he drops his watermelon!
"That badger's aiive an' onhurt,- an' as
hot as a lauy who's lost money. Which
he s simply retired a lew foot into his
house to reconsider Old Coyote an' that
tenarpe's riile of his. Nacherally when the
ontaught O!d Coyote lays down on his
lace an' goes to gropin" about . to fetch
that badger forth, the latter never hes'
tates. He grabs Old Coyote*s hand with
tooth and claw, braces his back ag'in the
ceil n* of his fcurrow an' stands pac.
"Badgers is plumb big people an' strong .
as ponies^ too. An' obdurate!. Son, a
badger is that decided an' set in his way
that sech feather-blown things as rocks '
an' hills is vacillatin' by comparison with -
'em. This yere partic-lar badger has them -
farujly weaknesses fully deeveloped, an*
the moment he cinches onto Old Coyote he
shore makes up his mind never to let go '
ag'in in this world nor the next.
"As I tells you, Old Coyote Is little an'.
weak, an' he can no more move that
hardened badger, nor yet fetch himse'f
loose than # he can sprout wings an' soar.
That badger's got Old Coyote; that he
holds him, prone an' fiat, ag'in the ground
tor houis. An' at last Old Coyote swoons
away. i ..
"Which he'd shore petered right thar, a
prey to badgers, if it ain't for a casooal
cowpuncherâ he's one of Old Man En
right's ridersâ who comes romancin'
along, an' is attracted to i the spot bv
some cattle who's prancin' an ' waltzin'

in wonder at the spectacle. Which the
visitin cow sharp seein'- how matters Is
headed, shoves his six-shooter in along

sotted badger, an' Old Coyote is saved.
Its a case of touch an' go at that. But
to caper back to where we leaves Dan
an Texas on the verge of them jocyoolari

" 'No, gentlemen,' Old Coyote is sayln'
in response to some queries of Dan an*

Promptly came the peacfi "ana â¢ honey,
and with Its appearance the pelting storm
outside lost all -power to annoy. My.
companion beamingly did me honor In a
full class. After a moment filled with
silence and peach and honey, and pos>
sibJy. too, with some notion of pleasing
my host . with a compliment, I said:
"That gentleman with whom you were
in converse last evening told me he never
passed a more delightful hour than he
spent listening to you. You recall whom
I mean?"
"Recall; him? Shore." retorted my
friend as' he recurred to the peach an-i
honey for a second installment. "You-all
alloodes to the little gent who's lame in
the nigh hind laig. He appeals to me,
speshul, as he puts me tn mind of old
Colonel Coyote Clubbs, who scares up
Doc Peets that time. Old Colonel Coyote
is lame same as this yere person."
"Frighten Peets!" I exclaimed with a
great air; "you amaze me! Give me the
particulars,"
"Why, of course," he replied, ,"I
wouldn't be onderstood that Peets is ter
rorized outright. Still, old Colonel Coyote
shore stampedes him an' forces Peets to
fly. It'S either vamos or shoot up pore
old Colonel Coyote, an' nacherally as
Peets wouldn't do the- latter his only al
ternatif is to go scatterin' off as I states.
"This yere old Colonel Coyote Clubbs
has a camp over ten miles to the no'th
of Wolfville off to one side of the trail
to Tucson. Colonel Coyotte lives alone,
an' has built himse'f a dug-outâ a sort
o' log hut that's half in an' half outen
the ground. His mission on earth is to
slay coyotesâ 'Wolnn' ' he calls itâ for
their pelts; which Old Coyote gets a dol
lar each for them furs, an' the New York
store which buys 'em tells Coyote to go
as Car as he likes. They stands eacer to
purchase all he can peel often them ana
miles. '..
"No; Coyote don't shoot these yere little
wolves; he p'isens 'em. Coyote'll take
about twelve foot, say, of a pine tree he's
cut lown- this yere timber is mebby eight
inches throughâ an' he'll bore in it a two
inch ' auger hole every two feet. These
holts is*. some deep; about four inches it's
likely. "Old Coyote mixes his p'sen with
beef j tallow, biles them ingreedients up to
fcether ai.whole lot, an* then while she's
melted that a-way, he pours it into these
yere auger holes an' lets it cool. It gets
good au' i hard, this arsenic-tallow does,
an' iheu Coyote drags the timber thus or
ganized .cut onto the plains to what he
regyards as a eleglble local'ty an* leaves
it lor the wolves to come an' fatten on.
Old Coyote will have as many as a dozen
of the^e sticks of timber, all bored an'
framed up with arsenic-tallow, scattered
a.bout. ' i.ach morxxin' while he's woltin'

Old Coyote once you would remember

while his lace is like a squinch owi's face
â kind o' . wide-eyed au' with a expression
of ignorant wonder, as If life that a-way

"Most likely now what fixes him firm
est in your mind is he don't drink none.
He declines nose paint in every form;
an' this yere abstinence, the same bein'
yoonique in Wollville, together with Old
Coyote conductin' himse'i as the p'llteat
an* best mannered gent to be met with in
all tjf Arizona, is apt to introode on your
attention. Colonel tterett once mentions
Coyote's manners.
" -Wblcn he couM give Chesterfield, Old
Coyot* could, kyarus an' spades,' - ob
eerves the colonel. I 'don't, myse'f, know
this Chesterfield none, but I can eee by
the fashion Colonel Sterett alloodes to
him that lie's a jodartcr.on manner an'
etiquette.;
â¢\Xs I says, a pecooliar trait o' OlÂ«l Ooy
ote is that he wen't drlnli iiothin" but
water. Despite this blemish, however,
when the tamp gets so It knows Old Coy

He's bo quiet an' honest an' ignorant an*
little an' lame an' so plumb p'lite besides,
lie grows on you. I can almost Bee tho
weazened old outlaw now as he comes
rockln' Into town with his Bix or seven
burro* packed hlsh as their y'ears with
i pelts.
"This time when Old Coyote puts Doc
Pcets in a. toomult is when he's first
pitched his dug-out camp an' begins to
honor Wolfville with his visits. At that
time none- of us appreciates pore Old Coy
ote at his troo worth, an* nacherally, on
account of them egreegious an' guileless
looks of his. eech humorists as Dan Boggs
au' Texas Thompson seizes on him as a
source of merriment.
"It's Old Coyote's third Â¦ expedition into
town, an' he's hovcrln* about the New

them pards of mine knows . Old Coyote,
they manasee to - gain a sidelight on
some of his characteristics, before Â¦ ever
they gets through. Doc Peets later grows
ashamed of the part he plays an' two
months afterwards, when Old Coyote is
chewed an' clawed to a standstill by a
lnfooriated badger he done mixes himse'f
up with, Pcets binds him up an* straight

recompense complete.
" 'It's merely paying for that outrage I

Synagogue you will ; still find the women
Bitting in the gallery . by themselves.
They are not allowed to sit with the men
at all, so the men '.cannot complain of
their hats.
Seriously for a moment, the question 13,
Can a matter of that. kind be determined
by legislation? Take the instance of the
theaters. The whole -matter came about
by one or two ladiea beginning to do that
thing before it. became general, and it
was .only after a good many did it that
the authorities of the theaters thought it
a good t^ing. Then it became an insti
tution, and as soon as it became an in
stitution there was legislation on the sub-.
Ject. In the same way it is probably not
best to: agitate the question until it Is
apparent that women themselves desire
this change. I have never heard a man
complain about a woman's bonnet in
church, but women have no business go
ing to church with extravagant bonnets.
EEV. FRANK K. BAKERi
A good deal of thu is folderol, I think.
Peopie are death on laas. Ul course mere
is an evil and . an inconvenience that
' snould ue removed, but it is not nearly so
bad us it's made out to oe. Some one
starts these things and some entireties
liJteUo take them up. This uidii'u start
with the church, but witn the tneater.
I. would not want some women to take
oft their hats in cnureh. It is Dad enough
to preach to them with their hats on, they
are' so nomely. And I'm not so- sure tnac
people are so anxious to see the preaccev,
eitner, tor a large part of them go to
bleep, anyhow.
Aly . old grandfather used to tell the.
stoiy of old .freacher Gruber back in
Pennsylvania, i Airs. Gruber wanted a
bhaker bonnet .and he wouldn't get her
one, so she sold a bureau one day when
he was away from her home and bought
one f cr herself. . The next Sunday, when
the walked into church," old Gruber cried:
Â¦ "Make way, make way, make way, peo
ple; there comes Mrs. Gruber with a bu
reau on her head." ;.
-Of course It's time to call a halt when It
comes to anything like thatâ when women
wear three-story hat3 with balconies all
around. 3ut so far as my congregation is
concerned," I have never seen anything ot
the kind. I think there i3 more reform
needed in the interior of the people, and
that will knock the extra stories off their
hats. When they get down to~ simplicity,
in mode of life, it will be all right.
-Perhaps there ought to be some prohibi
tion in the style of . headgear, but in all
1 the 'churches I have attended in San
/Francisco there is so much room in tho
I pews . that Â¦ people can ' spread themselves
out and not be disturbed by anybody's
hat/ It i3 the inborn selfishness of hu
manity that makes each one rush to get
Â¦ there, and get 'everything to bo had. re-
I gardless of other. people. In a crowded
auditorium women 'have no right, and
their own good taste should prevent them
rirom , putting on ; anything so extrava
gantly large as to interfere with others.
".\- 1 .think there i3 a sort of dignity about
Va- woman Â¦ with', her'-liat on. It is a part
of -her costume in church, and I would
not ask her to take it off. It would seem
a" breach of propriety to do It, and, be
sides, I would not want to see them with
their hats off. In any event, it is not my
business to make such a request. Let it
be done, if need be. by the officials of the
church. Nor would I announce it from
the pulpit. I do ; not think a preacher
should lower his dignity by meddling with
that sort of thing. It js humiliating and I
would not want them to think it was the
dictation- of Â¦ the preacher. On the whola
I think the men should keep their mouths
shut in . this matter. They should be the
last to criticize the women or say to them
"Take off your hats."
BE V. BURR M. \ WEEDE2T.
*As'to the' proposed change In the eth
ics; and forms of church going I do not
think it is likely to reach the Episcopal
church at all. I do ; 'not find that. any of
the congregation experience any incon
venience on account:of hats on the head3
of â¢ the â¢women, except in cases where
women indulge their'-love of millinery to a
very great extent? when they come to
church.- -If a. woman* dresses modestly. <ij
all good church women do in the house of
God, she la not likely by her headgear to
present an obstacle to the view of those
behind her. I am glad'to say that in the
congregation of St. Luke's I know of no
Instance of unusual and undignified dress
on the part'of any. .
It has always been the principle of tho
Episcopal church that women should havo
their heads covered In the house of God.
That principle has perhaps no . relation
whatever to the moraltles of the present
day, but it was a principle laid down by
St. Paul, who spoke by inspiration of -the
Holy Spirit; and we try even In these
. lesser details of the doctrine of the Bible
"to be obedient in our worship. In fact,
it is the more exact foron a form usually
followed, for women to ; have their heads
covered .'with a veil even at confirmation,
at the laying on of hands. I don't think
any moral principle is at stake whatever,
and I am certain that the Episcopal
church and the great Anglican commun
ion of which she is a pars.will never au
thorize or sanction .such- change in the
customs of the day.
MISS JENNIE BliAIIU :
Oh, dear! "Why should woinen take their
hats off?, It seems an absurd proposition.
The, pulpits in all the churches I have at
tended are elevated to such an extent that
no one can have difficulty, in seeing tho
minister. . Â¦ . ,
. Of. course at the theater 'it is different.
A play may be completely spoiled by soil*
woman's silly hat. But' even there It is
very inconvenient to take oft one's hat
and. hold it, together with opera-glasses,
fan and whatnot. " .'
- If women are asked to take off their hats
in church, no doubt they will do it cheer
fully, but it will be a great nuisance.
BEV. WILLIAM KTTtTC GTJTHRIE
I think It" Is a very-good thing for
women to remove their hats. I think ona
of the main principles of Christianity is
to do unto others as you would that they
should do to you, and:- certainly It you
were behind a large hat' and desired to
see the speakerâ a very; Important thing,
as, a sermon very often '..loses Its fores
where you cannot see the speakerâ you
would certainly wish that bat removed.
That's the thought; and -then if you make
application of the principle, :you would
remove your own hat, for, example is bet
ter : than precept And- why â¢ sEould the
i theater and the secular, lecture be ahead
of the church in what Is 'clearly a Chris
tian principle? ' .- â¢-â¢Â¦ -
The practice of putting on your be3t
Â¦ clothes on Sunday is the development of
a good principle, but nowadays It is car
ried rather too far and perhaps a rem
edy for the evil would be,., Instead of re
v moving the hat, to change vthe character
of it. There are many styles of headgear
that . are - simple.* modest and inoffensive,
and -the clothes and appearance of a per
son 1 , should. be, of Â¦ that., quiet character
which accords .with a" spirit of reverence
in the house of God.
CHARLES r. WEBB HOWARD.
It " depends entirely . on the arrangement
of .the seats. If they are .so arranged that
a ' woman's hat discommodes -. any . one, I
say yes ; if not, I say no. And that ap

wants to see the speaker, and If a wo

This refers more particularly to evening
coiffure. The "lovers' knot" makes a
charming effect for a pretty neck. The
wavy hair forms three puffs, with curls
on a line with it, but the woman with a
Roman or long nose had better erect it'on
top of her head to avoid showing the ex
treme lengthâ from the tip of her nose to
the final curl. A round face needs hair
arranged on top of the head, or, at least,
it should be brushed oÂ£T the forehead and

Â¦will take a few years- or so â five at least
â from her age, and givo piquancy to th<*
expression. The parting. should be slight,
not a pronounced line, which Is hard and
masculine.
Any one with a broad brow should wear
outset study and then adopt the style of
coiffure that best suite the contour of
head, beauty being greatly affected by
the way in which hair Is arranged; bad
points are softened and even obscured,
and good ones brought Into prominence.
No universal mode can be blindly fol
lowed if a woman would have artlstlo
proportions and bring out the best expres-,
Bion of her face.
For example, the severity of a Roman
nose may be tempered by the arrange
ment of the hair, which should not be
pompadour, but parted softly from tho :
face and gathered gracefully at the crown
of the head; the owner of a small nose
can with safety wear the hair arranged
blonde curls, or inky purple tresses, which
unbalance my peace of mind."
The EllckneEs and eheen of a woman's
head, without doubt, make a strong ap
peal to a man and cause him to succumb
â¢without a struggle. Nor is it unnatural
that this feature should appeal so directly
to his sense of womanly beauty. Having

Character Shown by tha Hair.
Woman may show her character more
by her hair than by eyes, nose, lips or ex
pression. Golden hair, ot a soft, pale
gold, without undulation, shows gentle
ness and ' tenderness, but no force of
character, if with pale blue-colored eyes,
it "is indicative of coquetry; if with pale
blue gray eyes, a r.entimental, but incon
stant person. Women with pale, blonde
hair are affectionate, impulsive and easily
moved to Jealousy. Chestnut hair of a
soft silky texture, and not very thick,
shows a romantic disposition: this hair
is never seen on commonplace realistic
people. Fine bljfck hair shows a high
strung and sensitive nature. Dark brown
hair i3 indicative of loyalty to a worthy
object that cannot be shaken by ill for
tune. People whose hair Is harsh have
amiable but cold natures. They are al
ways ready to listen, but it is difficult to
arouse their feelings. They rarely have
good memories:- they forget easily, are
procrastinators and bad at keeping ap
pointments. Coarse hair denotes ob
stinacy. It must be borne in mind that
there is a great difference bet-ween coarse
hair and hair that is harah, although It
requires an expert to distinguish it. For
example, hair may be as fine as silk, but
it cannot be trained in graceful waves;
that is because the hair is harsh.
Close-growing hair indicates violent L
temper;, without any wave or curl, a mel--^
ancholy disposition; wavy or curling and
thick hair shows force of character and a
certain ardor in love matters.

The clever French woman has many
ways of disposing of those short, stray
hairs at the nape of the neck, which often
stand out when the hair is dressed at.tht*
altitude and v convert the most demurs
Ken tie woman into a veritable Madge
"Wildfire In appearance. They may be
curled very closely to the neck, turning
the ends in. This is a difficult matter to
accomplish without assistance. Another
simple way of disposing of them is to curl
the strands of hair at the neck; this
causes the short hairs to cling- to the oth
ers when brushed tip and gives a neat,
compact appearance to the entire coiffure.
No one needs to fear an excess of deco
ration for the coiffure: three or four side
combs and as many fancy pins are only
a beginning toward complete stylish hair
dressing. Mercury wings In spansled
gauze or set with precious stones are very
effective, and silver set with ordinary
brilliants is very showy. A dainty even
ing decoration is a narrow wreath of vio
lets or some fine flower around the back
hair and fastened at the top with an up
right bow of white satin ribbon. Feathers,
aigrettes and bows are still with us: most

an effective tablecloth, but a very dura

Highly extravagant cloths, those In-,
tended for Easter wedding gifts, are made
of squares or wash silk in pink, alter
nated with squares of lace. The lace must
come in little patterns without raw edges,
and the silk must be hemmed to keep it
free from fraying. This Is really one
kind of patchwork, and when completed it
shows its- workmanship. . Â¦

As an aside it may be stated that it is
the very latest idea to cleanse table laces
in a water that is a very weak starch.-
A teaspoonful of starch to less than a
tub of water is about the right! propor
tion. Two waters will usually suffice and
the wnole must be aone Dy squeezing in
stead of rubbing. When' stains will posi

a much lower rate than one can keep a

replacing them and keeping them up to
the standard of fashionable requirements
it takes a positive genius as well as a
long purse.

admiration and mental applause. But
how is it practical for the every-day wo
man with a small purse? "
Doilies or "table mats," as they are
called in more I homely parlance, come
for placing under the principal dishes of
the home table and for general utility
It Is difficult to state just how many
doilies could bo employed during: one din
ner upon a well-dressed table. There are
the smallest of doilies to go under the
finger bowls, between the bowls and the
little plates upon which the bowls are
served and tiny ones for the olive and
almond plates.
Then, there are the large, square doilies
to He under, each cover and it is these
doilies which are the most serviceable of
all. A dinner table set with knives, forks,
spoons, glasses and with a handsome
doily at each place Is a charming sight
though fashion does not say that this
dolly Is absolutely necessary. Yet it
certainly preserves the cloth and the cus
tom of. using it thus In the setting of the
table is worthy of imitation.
Of. the making of doilies any house
keeper will tell you that there is positively
no end; and she will point to the pile
of them fresh from the hands of the laun
dress, as well as to heaps of them in the
linen closet, while others await her busy
needle.
The Making of Doilies. â¢
If one uses just the good linen cloth,
' and to do even this requires considerable
outlay, one needs the doily. Indeed, the
doily is an indispensable adjunct upon
any table, be it a lace-covered one or one
of linen. And here comes the real'oppor
tunity, for handiwork.
rusca upun it. U'nese. are emoroiderea In.
their natural colors, with the embroidery
stuffed a little to make it more natural.
The stems, leaves and even the little
shadowy background all has its share of
embroidery.
The edges of the cloth are lace trimmed
or plain. It is not considered essential
that there should be any trimming upon
these edges, though Mrs. Lawson of Bos
ton, whose table decorations are said to
be the prettiest in the world, has a cloth
trimmed around the edge with lace, with
plaitings of chiffon underneath the lace.
The dressing- of the table begins with
the cloth. There are families that prefer
the polished table and at one time it was
unquestionably popular, but now the sight
of a polish is rare, while the use of the
table cloth is almost universal. You must
call it the hunger cloth when you are
talking- for company.
It may be stated that were the polished
table to prevail it would be much more
The Hunger Cloth.
But it is not with the matter of a pot
of plants or a center piece that the table
decorations end.
The matter of a centerpiece is ex
cusably critical, for it is on steady view
from the beginning to the ned of the meal:
and the woman who brings out a pot of
palms and sets it upon a circle of glass,
a mirror, perhaps, and places the whole
upon the middle of the table has per
formed an act which is appreciated by the
whole family. .
The matter of dressing: the table is car
ried to such an extent in certain house
holds that its excessive decorations lay
the hostess cpen to accusations of ex
travagance. One sees the most lavish ex
penditure of time, and not only time, but
money, all put forth upon some trifle up
on which the table dishes are to be set
forth.
It is undoubtedly a fact that the table
offers the greatest field lor a woman's en
deavor and the most satisfactory one.
There is no Â¦well-regulated home in which
the family does not sit three times a day
to a well-ordered meal; and at these
times it is not only the food that is en
joyed, but the table decorations as. well.
Whatever may be the object for which
her chining weapon plies itself it is cer
tain that the woman who is doing the
work is desirous of accomplishing some
thing pretty. She wants new articles with
Â¦which to embellish her home or the
homes of her friends.
Possibly her needle may be busily em
ployed upon a little work of art to be
given as an Easter wedding present, and
for that reason she is double particular
about its results. 'Â¦.'Â¦â¢'Â¦Â¦Â¦''.'...

She may be sewing for the charity pale
which is to take place six weeks hence,
directly after Easter.
Or she may be sewing for her own
family.
Those who recall the Old Dutch
days of New York will tell you that it
was the custom for the housewife to not
only do her own table mending but the
washing of her own little linen and lace
works of art. On Saturday morning a
servant would bring in a pan of soft wa
ter made sudsy with white soap; and an
other pan of clear water, with a third
pan of starchy water.
Seated at her dining 1 table, with rings
laid aside and sleeves pushed up to the
elbow, the thrifty dame would squeeze
out her table laces and hand them from
pan to pan. Finally, she passed them
over to a maid to be carefully pulled in
shape and dried in the sun. No other
hands could do the work as well or as
lovingly. :Â¦-Â¦Â¦;
To take care of one s own table is no
disgrace, be It cups or linen; and In these
days of delicacy of appointment it be
comes actually necessary fflr a woman to
exercise a personal supervision or the
drain upon the family purse will exceed
her possibilities.

use wherever a large or a h<?t dish is to

The necessity for these 13 appreciated
In the shops, where one can buy seta of
woolen table mats; and in every home
there is some one skilled in the art of
knitting these mats in various sizes; but
it is much more up to date to use the
doily and, If . necessary, it can be rein
forced with *a thin lining of cotton flannel
with a reverse side of linen to protect
the table from the heat ot the vegetaoie
and meat dishes.
The. Useful Kind.
A set of these very useful table decora
tions was made in light blue denim, cut
In oblong shapes and worked around the
edge with a border of roses done in long
stitch embroidery. There was an edge
of coarse blue colored lace. This was a.
very useful every-clay set and one that
would stand washing many times.
Another set showed a long table raa^
nearly two yards long and only half a
yard wide. This was intended for a scarf
to travel down the length of the table.
It was made of heavy white linen, dec
orated along the edges with diamonds of
lace set on cornerwise. Under each dia
mond was set a square of deep pink.wash
silk. At the plates were smaller mats
to match. â¢Â¦'- :Â¦Â¦Â¦
Those who like all white, and who do
not particularly desire lace for everyday
â¢wear, when one day, or two at most,
marks the life of a tablecloth, can use
the long 1 linen strips that come by ths
yard and decorate them with embroidery
and drawn work. The drawn work ones
are always beautiful, and for those who
have eyesight and patience there la no
limit to the elegance to which a tablo
spread can be carried. The Mexicans do
this drawn work In a superior manner
and a good piece of their skill brings
mere than fine lace.
In making drawn work It is now the
practice to use a little stitching- along the
borders where the drawn work is to de
terminate. Thus outlined with linen
threads. It is easier to pull the stitches
and the work of drawing: out is not so
taxing to the eyesight.
For those who will not do drawn work
there is a new frill. Linen of the finest
kind is boldly cut in squares. Along the
edge of a handsome linen doily there are
openings made, square, oblong or round,
and under these there are pieces of con
trastinc linen set.
Old Fashioned Patchwork.
It requires a little careful handling of
the needle to do this work well and won- I
derfully. It seem3 like putting a patch
in the goods, which it really is. The con- /
vent sisters, patient, good souls, do this
â¢work so exquisitely that ladies who can
afford to pay the prices are rushing oft
with their squares of linen and taxing
the eyesight of the sisters to its fullest
capacity.
A set. of doilies of yellow wash silk
was pin-tucked throughout the entire
width. The whole was then laid upon, a.
square of lace so that the lace projected
on every tide, one mat over another, a
mat cf silk over a mat of lace.
The hand-painted doily is here to stay.
but it is an extravagance, a woful waste
of money, you will say, and of time and
thought. A beautiful centerpiece designed
by a New York artist showed a circle of
Â¦white satin with an edge embroidered la
several shades of lavender. Purple Irl3,
with the long conventional green leaves,
was arranged around the middle. The
iris was done in hand-patntifig, to be
ruined at one drop of water.
There is a way for protecting the hand
. painted centerpiece, and It is by mean3
of a circle of glass. This really adds to
the appearance of the centerpiece. The
glass may be beveled and as heavy a3
desired, and it may be a fine piece of
plate class. But results almost as good
and in some cases really better are ob
tained with plain glass that Is merely
cut circular and smoothed along the edge
to allow of Us being handled. The glass
must not be too thin or it will break un
der the weight of the fruit dish. It is .
not Intended as a looking glass, but it is
clear glass, through which the beauty of
the centerpiece can be plainly perceived.

wound in the neck "Inflicted by an un
known assassin." His body was found
at 3:30 a. m.. December 13, 18S5, at the
corner of Pacific and Dupont streets, so
says the record. But ex-Chief Lees says
he was stabbed by an English sailor, who
after the crime boarded a ship and went
to Portsmouth, England. The city at
that time did not ' have the contingent
funds to . make \ the trip and investi

The neighbors heard the tacklag down

aroused when , Le Roy went [ down to the
bank and . tried : to ' draw" Ekerret's 'money.'
Investigation brought the horrible fact to
light that Skerret â¢ had been strangled - in
one of the closets of the Ellis-street house.
A Mr. Dollar, an accomplice, got the
key from a neighbor, and to > throw 'off
suspicion from Le Roy engaged the house
himself.
A parallel case of a body being found in
a vacant house occurred in the early '80's.
Wright Le Roy pretended that, he wanted
to buy property of Capitalist %kerret and
lured him Into a vacant house on Ellis

MYSTERIOUS murders? Mys
tertous Is a big word," said ex-
Chief. Lees when I asked him to
relate some of the mysterious
crimes that had come under his
investigation during almost half a century
of his term In office-''.' /.(Â¦'.
"Some of the crimes that seem' most
mysterious are the simplest when un
raveled. Lack of complication makes it
hard to get at a. loose end.
"Then way back of a murder Is that
mystery of motive.
"But Til tell you one thing I am going
to do before I pass in my checks and 6tep
down and out," said the captain. "I In
tend to dear up a few mysteries on which
I have collected sufficient evidence.
"Of mysterious murders there may seem
on the face of It to be many, but there
are few dewless murders.
"In nearly every case the^ murderer
etands morally convicted, but there Is a
distinction between moral conviction and
criminal conviction. A man may stand
morally convicted before the court and
the world and yet there may not be legal
evidence enough to convict him.
"The State fairly reeks In bloody stench.
There is the lynching case at Alturas;
and In this city the case of Policeman
Robinson's murder and the case of the
four conspirator strikers who killed Elce.
The Investigation of the Nora Fuller mur
der adds another chapter to the book of
crime.
"The cases that I expect soon to go
East to Investigate are the hitherto un
explained mysteries to the public of the
reign of terror of the tenderloin. I have
evidence that I hope to work up to place
blame where It belongs."
The murders to which Lees referred '
â¢were those which terrorized the "White
chapel of San Francisco in February and
March, 189&. Little May Smith, or Mag
gie McDermott, as she was known in her
district, was found strangled on the early
morning of February 10. May Smith was
a girl of beauty and young in crime. She.
was only 20. She had rooms back of a
ealoon. There were two entrances to her
rooms, one through the saloon and one
from the Eide street, and as her apart
ments were anything but exclusive It was
nobody's business In particular to notice
who entered or left.
The secrecy and at the same time the
abandon of those of her profession offer
scope for undetected midnight murders.
History abounds in Just such Instances.
The deed was done and the murderer
escaped and It was not until the collector
called for Maggie McDermoU's rent that
the crime was discovered.
Finger marks on her throat showed how
her* end had come. The police closely
patrolled the streets and cross-qupstloned
every one they could think of. when sud
denly right under their supervision an
other and more awful murder shocked the
community.
On the morning of March 10. a French
man, Caesar Chebart, found Bertha Para
dls dead In her rooms. * She had been
choked to death by means of a large
handkerchief, which had been forced
down her throat with the aid of a car
penter's pencil. Although Caesar Che
bart had been living with her, he was ob
viously the last man to have committed
the crime, and as in the Maggie McDer
mott case no one had taken cognizance
of her visitors.
Chief Lees declares that the curtain
has not fallen on the last of this tragedy.

Bowers was arrested, tried, convicted
and sentenced to death. Wtile in Jail his
brother-in-law, Henry Benhayon, was
found dead in a Geary street lodging
house. It was supposed to be suicide, but
in letters which he left he accused his
dead sister of unfaithfulness to her bus- '
band and confessed that he had com
mitted her murder. It developed that Ben
hayon had not committed suicide, but was
the pivot of a plot to free Dr. Bowers.
John A. Dlmmlg was suspected of being
an' accomplice of Bowers. He had rented,
the room where Benhayon died and to â¢
the trial it developed that Dtrnmig had
spent much time writing with the : dead,
man, over whom he exercised a strong '
Influence.
The Bowers case Involves -from on* to
five murders, unexplained as far as ths
law is concerned and unsatisfied In pun

5How Many Matches Are Struck in a Single Day?
MOW many matches are struck in
a single day?", asked an enthus
Â¦ iastic young statistician, "and how
many cords of wood, and how
many tons of sulphur,' and how many
units of heat, are represented .In the
world's daily consumption of matches?
Here is an interesting problem. Matches,
of course, are not used in all the countries
of the world. There are many primitive
people who are still kindling lirea by
striking sparks from flinty substances,
just as our ancestors did In the long ago,
when they made pots and kettles out of
clay and stones, and knives out of bones,
and the harder formations in the crust
of the earth. Some countries are so damp
that matches cannot be used with con
venience. In many of the tropical , coun
tries which may be- classed- as civilized,
matches cannot 'be struck on account of
the dampness, except on the rough, sandy
edge of the box. But in the great and
more advanced countries of the world
matches are in almost universal use.
- "The consumption In the United States
daily is sometiiing enormous. Koundly,
there are so.ooo.OuO persons in the United
States. On the accepted allowance of nve
family this means 16,000,000 fam
ilies, so right on the jump we would have
16,OtiO,t'0O stoves, whieh would consume at
the very lowest an* average of three
matches each day, or a total of 4S,0OO,0OO.
In the evening the lamps must be lighted
in each of these homes. There are the
hotels, restaurants, the saloons and the
business places generally which keep open
at night, with their millions of gas jets
and lamps, and it is reasonable to assume
that the consumption of matches in those
places' would equal, if it did not surpass,
the consumption in the homes of the coun
try. Mind you, I have said nothing about
the factories and institutions of that sort,
and ' nothing about the vast quantity of
matches consumed daily, by. the smokers
of the country, the cigarette fiends and
the fellows whose pipes are always goins
out. Why, a fortune goes up daily in
matches' smoke, and the sulphur, and
wood, and .units of heat wasted 1 in this
way is" something startling. Electricity
has- to some extent cut down the con
sumption of matches, -but the consumption
is large enough and the fellows who are
to come after us may have reason to de
plore our extravagance - in this respect,
for wood Is getting scarcer all the time."â

Â»"W LITTLE San Franciscan has had a
[ I miraculous restoration in the water
I I cf Lourdes.
V, I After fifteen months of sufferingâ
JL fifteen months during which the
hope of her recovery had grown less day
by dayâ she was taken at last to the place
of miracles.
Another miracle happened. Another to
add to the long list that has. been in
creasing for almost half a century, ever
since, so tradition has it, the Virgin Alary
revealed herself to the prayir.s peasant
girl. Ten-year-oM Gladys Sullivan, a lit
tle sufferer, who could not move without
her crutches, was able to cast them aside
and walk when she left Lourdes.
It sounds like one of the pretty tales
that we read in books of old lore. > It
savors of Old World tradition. It sounds
like the beautiful unreal. Tet it is a fact
â¢ that faces us right here in our midst. It
is known to all those who know the little
girl. She left her San Francisco home a
fcorry. invalid and returned well, able to
take up life like other children with all
its happy romps and games.
Before she went away life had grown to
be a dreary thing to her. She had had' a
fallâ a. serious one â and she recovered
from the first pain of it to find herself a
crippleâ one knee badly injured. In the
beginning nobody thought her suffering
would last. She had youth as a weapon
to fight with, to fight for health. But the
days went by and still her pain was the
BÂ£iae and still she had to cling to her
crutches. The knee was seriously affected
and the doctors pondered alone and with
their heads together, both in vain.
All her fun was spoiled. When other
little girls wanted to play running games
she haO to be counted out. She could sit
in the window and watch them, but that
was worse than not watching. It made
her want to join them so that she couldn't
stand.it. She had to go away, off to a
back room, where she could not look out
on the tas and the ' hide-and-go-seck
cames that were going on. At times she
had to choke back something that would
ktcp coming into her throat In the queer
est way.
She had dolls and books, and all the
things that can be played with quietly,
but they grew tiresome. One can't be
quiet all the time. "When you are a little

That was the way with Gladys Sullivan.
She could not wait to be well again; she
could not bear this any longer. And all
the time the doctors were saying, "You
inust bear it."
But only for a little while they told
her. They believed confidently that it
would not be long before she was strong
again.
So they and the parents and the little
girl kept on wonting and waiting.
The months slipped by. The family be
gan to despair of recovery here. They
took the child away.
Then began the long, weary seekingâ
the seeking fpr the one, the only thing
in this world that ma_es all the rest of
life worth whileâ health.
All over Europe they traveled in the
search.
They went to London. There they con
culted Morris, one of the most eminent
physicians that the great city boasts ofâ
a man who holds the high position of vice
president of the city's College of Physi
cians and Surgeons. He examined the In-
Jury and treated it according to all his
wisdom.
He arranged some sort of apparatus to
encase the knee. It was built by the
plans of "wonderful modern science. He
believed it must effect a cure.
The little invalid did not improve.
Bhe was taken to the Continent, even'
to Paris. A great physician of the French
school was consulted. He removed the
London doctor's bandages, sure that the
knee must heal then. His method was the
opposite of his predecessor's, but it failed
as completely. â¢/#..'.'.
â¢ Then the skill of Switzerland was tried.
' There is a world-famous surgeon there, a
I Dr. Kocher, a man who can charge 25,000
i francs for a single consultation. His fame

j Germany, who, in medical and . surgical

i them, to join their ranks In one of their
universities, but he chose to' remain a
Swiss subject, as he was born.

Flickers of many-colored light, steal in
through the stained glass of the high
windows.- The place is cold, the water
icy. Its purity is one of its miraculous
qualities.
Into. these baths dozens of pilgrims aro

twice a day: Yet in spite of that it keeps
as clear as when it first gushes forth in
the grotto, and although many filthy and

She is a very happy little girl now and
all those who love her are perhaps even
more happy than she. In the gratitude
of her heart Mrs. Sullivan has presented
to St. Brigid's Church a beautiful statueâ
an image of "Our Lady of Lourdes," ex
actly : like the one that stands in the
grotto. There all who' enter the church

who shall wonder that those who have

"Our Lady Is trying my faith," she said.
Again she went to the icy bath. Our
Lady must have been testing her faith, in
deed, and she must have found It strong.
This time the reward came.,
Gladys Sullivan threw away her
crutches and walked.
Again there was no particular change.
This time there were more to pity, more
to offer the consolation that many are
called but few are chosen.
After one bath there was no change.
"When she returned there were those out
side who were ready to pity and offer con
solation. She looked at them in amaze
ment.'
"Why, you needn't be sorry for me,"
she said. "I shall be made well."
With her baby faith unswerving she.
went again to the bath.
The child had to be assisted to enter.
She was limping miserably with the aid
of her crutches at the time.
Then came the trial ot her faith. Into
the cold room she went, the place where
the icy water awaits believers. Attend
ants are there always to care for patients.
She believed. Perhaps the Blessed Lady
looked upon the simple, pure faith of thÂ»
little one and knew that it deserved her
blessing. /'

approach the grotto. "When the blessir.gr 13

I went to Lourdes with my daughter, who for fifteen months
had been suffering from the results of a severe accident. She had
* fallen ?.nd water had formed in the knee. She was helpless without
crutches.
She was taken to some of the greatest physicians in Europe, all
without avail. Among those' who were consulted were Dr. Morris,
the vice president of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Lon
don, a ; famous ; Parisian, a member of the Legion of Honor, and
Dr. Kocher of- Switzerland, a msu whose reputation is so'exten
sive that he was offered a high position in the University of Ber

man universities are. Dr. Keener has been paid as much, as 25,
000 francs. for- performing en operation:
These men and others failed to help the child. When at last
she was taken to Lourdes she could not dispense with her crutches
for a moment.
- After " three baths >in the wonderful water she left her
crutches.
This does not mean that an absolute cure was effected. The
knee is not as strong" as yours or mine. It is somewhat stiff and
the child walks slowly. Â¦ But the condition is steadily improving
and she has not needed her crutches once "since bathing at Lourdes.

There are three-quarter .ength . coats.
also, of fur ready for the woman who pre- .
fere them, but they are heavy and warm
for ordinary use and not nearly as natty
looking as the fancy styles and shapes.
However, when such a coat Is worn It is
usually of. Persian and has no other fur
used as a trimming. The solid black looks
better when there Is so much of it. These
coats, by the way, are not generally made
tight fitting. The half fitted back looks
less bulky than does, the really snug one.';
. " Sealskin is always a good fur. Capes
are made of it, but they- are not as smart
this year as boas. Sealskin muffs are car
ried with seaiskin jackets, which are mads j
up without any -other fur as a trimming.
Long evening . wraps are very beautiful
made, of fur and -velvet coats are charm
ing with fur trimmings. A nt coat of red
velvet has a deep collar and cuffs oJT
ermine and the fronts tarn back and are
deeply 'faced with the fur the" full length
of tha coat. Of course one cannot buy a
coat of this description by merely walking
into a shop and asking for it. These
Frenchy novelties are made by order, but
a sample of any coat or fur garment may
bo seen for the asking.

courtesy a postilion back, but that cer

Another nobby Jacket- is made of the
baby 'lamb. It .is very, very, short all

stands up perfectly straight arid contin

"Marie never had to learn either acting

To keep house and entertain their
friends without knowing how to cook is
the specialty of Marion \Jonvere and Mar
garet Wycherly, the Alcazar lavomes.
They did not have to rehearse ior this
specialty; it just naturally came to them.
Iheir pretty flat at Â»3l Golaen Gate ave
nue is just fit lor a dainty housekeeper,
but the maid and the cook run all that
part of the home life. They do all the
ordering and pay all the bills, while the
busy hostesses do all the eating. Mis3
Convere acknowledges to; being fond of
"tufsing- round a gas range," and one day
"managed to bojl some eggs, and felt a.3
big as the Pflpsident . of the United
States." Miss \lycherly does not cla.m
this much ability^ but loves to keep house
all the same.
I>ut once in a while :n the afternoons
when lehearsal is over early and no
dressmakers, the bane of an actress' life;
are around, the cook and the maid havÂ».
to take a back seat while the theatrical
friends of tne hostesses roll up their
sleeves and "get up a good dinner."
Among the men ' Howard Scott is ac
counted the boss cook and is called a iust
class "mixologist," probably the result of
his having money left him and wearing
silk dressing" gowns. His punch needs no
label, it speaks ior itself. There are many
marks of artistic taste about this littio
home, and good pictures, and books are in
evidence.
Some of the pre-eminent advantages of
housekeeping, according to Miss Conveie.
are: "Having things to eat that tasta .-Â»â¢Â»
if you cooked them yourself; not having
to live up to people so; being able to go
to dinner in neglige; having a quiet place
to study, and being able to entertain your
friends under ycur own roof tree. So yen
see we are just like other people, after
all." â¢--.â¢â¢ . - -
The Tivoli people are not shining ligtits
in the realm of housekeeping, at least no't
many of them. Annie Myers is the bird
of passage of the crowd, and has just
flitted from furnished rooms on Â£ddy
street to the Hotel St. Nicholas. House
keeping is too lonely for her, she says.
A prominent housekeeping man with
everything around him gave a family it,
Edward Webb, the second comedian "ami
sweet voiced tenor of the Tivoli. Threo
rooms are big eni.ugh to hold him and his
piano, and his friends sometimes, at 131
Turk street- He says one nice thing 1 a'oow
housekeeping for one is ""that* you c<?n
have your friends to see you and not have
a landlady yelling at you to "not make so
much noise up there.' "
And his friends do come to see him. too,
and there are always one or two actors'
roaming around his little nest of a din
ing-room, "cooking up things." His mode
of housekeeping varies. One day he ha,s
in a Jap to cook, the next he gets his own
meals, the next day '.'some one comes to
stay two or three days with me and I
have to cook myself and do the honors,"
and the next he takes refuge in a restpu
rant. ~ _-:Â¦Â¦::
But in spite of all. he thinks a single
actor has a better time .doing his own
home making than Jiving in a stuffv
boarding-house, "full of all kinds of hu
man curios." And perhaps he is ri^hr.
"Teddy" is a Britisher and the Kngiish
flag, forms one of his house decorations.
M. L. Alsop. leading man at the. Alca
zar, hrs no one to housekeep with, and as
ho likes to be right in the center of things
he boards at the Langham Hotel. Ferris
liartman of the Tivoli is â¢living with
friends now. but he has the housekeeping
bee in his bonnet, and some time, '"maybe
next summer,", he says he will take a fur
nished flat, too.

"Why, they have none. Who ever

of the footlights?" Yes, but they have,

Miss Baggo Cor.klin of the Alcazar,
Â¦with hpr mother, occupies a prettv suite
of rooms at the Hotel Savoy. Evcrvbody
In the company envies Miss Cor.klin her
talent in the line of embroidering and
laccmaking. Her room Is sometimes a be
wildering array of lovely gowns spread
out for the ediiication of her friends, and
all bearing the evidence of her dainty
handiwork. One black velvet cloak, stud
ded over with white lace butterflies made
by the clever fingers of the actress, divides
the honors in loveliness with a whole lace
town that took months and years ot spare
movements to mako. A stunning gown of
lavender silk, embroidered with blu*h pink
roses, represents lots of work on the part .
of the -wearer, for Miss Conklln embroid
ered every stitch of the llowers. Drop in
upon her when fhe is at home and you
will find her either making lace or sing-
Ing, for she has a rich contralto which
the uses well. It is told by a favored
few that she chines in domestic life a'su
Â«.s a food cook.
Marie Howe, also of the Alcazar, is
widely spoken of as "the best cook 5n
the country: with rooking beans as an
unequaled specialty." She has lonsr been
settled in housekeeping with her mother
on Valencia street.
1 "It's a pretty fiat, but ft is almost too
large for our little family," says Mips
Howe'* mother; "but I like Jt, because It
Is a pood way off from the atmosphere of
the dressing-room, which always smoth
ers me."
"Far be It from me to talk it over." say3
Miss Howe, "but five years of stock work
and character parts all through the
pamut, from peasant g1Â»i4o drunken ol-.l
woman. does not give j^Te a great chance
for cooking and housekeeping, both of
which I loveÂ» If I have a mania It Is for
making tea; but far be it from me to be
left alone with a cup of it.'.' :.< -

â¢ Tom Hay was acting /as (interpreter for the : prince of Chinese.,
comedians and making the most of the opportunity.- to air his vo- N
cafculary to, its full capacity. To : Ah Shong the oaths were per-//,!
haps as meaningless as Tom Hay's Chinese lingo was. to the-re-/^
porter. At any rate he smoked his opium serenely, indifferent. to *
the turmoil going on around him in his cramped and now badly ;
overcrowded dressing room high up- over the stage of .the -Wash- â¢.
Inton-street Theater, v V; : ," _ <. .'â¢ " v
/Ah Shong has an international reputation for his funnyisms. ,. f.
Those who know best the history of his many histrionic triumphs
declare that he-.is.one cf the greatest comedians in China and the
veryâ best that ever came to America. Certain, It'is that he has -
been given the undisputed title of the Prince of Chine'se Comedians .'
since he filled a short engagement in San Francisco while on his
way to New York a few years ago. At that time,. he created a'-big
sensation, but nothing quite equal to the excitement' 1 - that has* at-,
tended his return for the New Year festivities in Chinatown. His Â¦ â¢
reappearance is the greatest event in years. He is engaged 'Co act
by the year at $30ftÂ»_a month, a truly fabulous price in the eyes of *
the poor play-going. Celestials. Chan Chung, the local theatrical Â¦
magnate, considers him a bargain at the- price, so just at present ,.
â¢Ah Shong is the most important individual in the whole Mongolian
quarter. He is a veritable potentate. . . ' â¢ Â¦' , - :
* As Ah Shong had been. smoking for an hour, with one servant ,
to prepare and ccok the opium end another to. hold .the pipe and/:
serve the drug, -while he rested with his head, contentedly .pillowed; "'
on a wooden block, the- question was asked' as to when;Â£he- re-- â¢
hearsal would begin. It had already begun, said* Tom* Hay. -.In '
fact; it had been going on ever- since Ah Shong began to smoke.
The dreamy meditation found in the thickening fumes were abso
lutely necessary to an inspired interpretation of 'his part. 'Â¦Â¦
But suddenly Tom Hay saw the possibilities of the advertising '
in such an article, and as suddenly, changing, his base began to ;'â¢,
cajole Ah Shong Into having the picture taken.'- When, however,
that autocrat of the Oriental drama dropped off into a' sound sleep
in the midst of Tom Hay's most winning argument the interpreter -
swore louder and longer than ever. But Ah Shong dreamed, on
until 4 o'clock, while the light of day steadily faded and \the
chances of photographing the Prince of Chinese Comedians before',
the end of the two weeks' celebration of the New Year were going < '
glimmering. Ah Shong was hungry. He must feast at once,. and'
then â perhaps he might consent to a picture. - '-. / ,
Att5 o'clock he felt much refreshed, and then there arose a loud â¢
chattering ar.d hurrying of feet that made a perfect bedlam of the ;
empty theater. _Ah Shong demanded an Emperor's robes, the
richest and finest In the theater wardrobe. None other would he
be pictured in, for It is a.superstition of the race that the baleful'
eye of the evil spirit shining out of the lens of- a modern camera
is likely to transform Its victim for life Into the character repre- ]
sented -at the moment. Ah, Shong may not believe the superstition,
. but he would take. no chances. So .the picture was. taken in the V
uncertain light at half-past 5. At 6 o'clock Ah Shong was back
at the theater and the New Year drama was on. â¢
Throughout all that night, the next day, and the next night as
well the theater was packed from pit to ceiling. Ah Shong has
evidently learned a thing or two from the "continuous", vaudeville '
In New York, for, knowing himself to be the whole attraction,* he
let the drama take its course as best It might until it pleased him.
to appear. .Although he was billed to appear at 11 o'clock on ' 4 the â¢
evening of the second day/he kept the packed audience waiting v
until fully an hour after midnight while he smoked several, pipev
of opium in his dressing room.
Then he came on to a roar of laughter before he hadipoloen a
word. There is nothing grotesque In his make-up or his acting. 'Â¦
Indeed, he is the most human of them all. .It is simply that his<"
very presence exhales good humor. The plot of the playâ iMiaa a -
better plot* than many of the up-to-date American productions
deals with the political ambitions and mixed matrimonial relation
ship of Ah Shong's father and uncle,* and at the climax; already *
delayed two 'hours, during which time the less favored actors had â¢
to fake-up their scenes as best they. could, Ah Shong. appeared. He- '
is something, of a combination of the Prodigal Son and Peck's Bad ;
Boy, and he proceeded- to convulse the audience by ridiculing all -'
: : his numerous relatives. : . , Â¦ ;,- .. \...,:. j
But hp only rema'nÂ»d on thea stage three minutes by actual
count, although the audience had "waited more than six hours for
his appearance. Then, quite sure of his triumph, he went back to 1
his dressing room for another smoke, while the audience' turned >
quickly aside from a final tableau and hurried out into the rala.

""In fomc cases Mr. Carnegie's offer*
have not been accepted by the communi
ties receiving them; thus Eaton Pa
voted to feline the $50,000 offered' for a
library building, owing to themalnte
raue fund required; at Grand Rapids,
Mich., an offer of $100,000 from Mr Car
oie v.ae later withdrawn In view of the
HWst simultaneous oner of Jiso.TJOO from
Â« t\Â»incr citizen of the town; and in sev
Â«.ial cases the acceptance of > Carnegie
i;.iis is Btm pending owing to reluctance
it inability to meet the conditions Im
posed. These conditions are the familiar
oiios that the city shall provide a cite and
guarantee a yearly maintenance fun-t
amounting to 10 per cent of the Carnegie
gift. These conditions have been seldom
â¢waived, the girt of $500 to a school Hbrarv
in Btaten Island, $1000 to* the Seaboard
Air Line traveling libraries, $5000 to thfj
New York Press Club for book and $500J
for the Skene Memorial Library at Grif
fins Corners. N. Y., being about the only
exceptions In the past year's record."
Here is an alphabetically arranged list
of such gifts and bequests, together with
sundry notes of interpretation:
We are enabled, thanks to the Library
Journal for January, to give some details
concerning the gifts made by Mr Carne
g-ie for the establishment or development
of libraries in the United States, which
in this particular field of philanthropy
leached the immense total of $13,813,000.
This sum was distributed among ono hun
dred and fifty-three places in tbirty-thrre
fatates. Porto Rico. Canada and British
Columbia, the largest individual items be
ing $5,000,000 for branch libraries In New
York City. $1,000,000 to St. Louis for the
same purpose and a like turn for the en
dowment of the Carnegie libraries of
Eradford. Duquesne and Homestead. In
Pennsylvania. It should be borne In
mind that It was In 1901 that Mr. Carna-
Sje made gift* for library purposes In
i-ngland amounting to over $800,000 and
at ,, th Â« same time it is Interesting to re
call the circumstances and provisions of
Eomc of his American gifts. According to
the Library Journal:
As may be remembered by many, thi
roost striking feature of the gifts and
bequests of tno year was the exceedingly
large individual amounts. Mrs. Le'.and
Stanford consummated her long-planned
endowment of Leland Stanford Jc Uni
versity, which is now the wealthiest in
stitution the world has ever known: An
drew Carnegie gave to colleges and lor
public libraries more than S31,000,OCO, and
at the close of the year had conditional
offers pending of several millions more,
end J. Pierpont Morgan, John D. Rocke
feller, Dr. Daniel K. Pearsons. Mrs. Em
mons Blaine. Helen M. Gould - and other
men and women noted lor their philan
thropy continued to promote the interests
with which their namea have long been
identified.
Last year when Frederic Harrison was
in this country he wu astonished to learn
that In 1900 nearly {50.000,000 bad been
realized by gifts and bequests for the ben
efit of general education and culture.
What would he say to the S107.3aO.000 that
1901 has brought forth from the pockets
of our generous countrymen?
LAST year if;
charitable peo
plÂ« of the Unf
ted States rimplj
outdid themselves
tn the!r generosity. Be
low ts given a list of tilÂ©
gifts during the year cf
lSiil. TiiiÂ« hst is restricted
to donations pivea by In
dividuals for the benefit of
the public at largeâ mona7
intended for the education of
ihe masses in literature, *4 - t .
or science. Ko rum of less
than $5W0 has been Â«f ecorded.
Last year, the first one of thÂ«
new ctutury. was the gala year
of al). Just think of it, over
iioO.Outi.OOO in gifts, and bequests.
This fur exceeds the returns ot
any otber year on record, and. in
fact, is greater than almost any
three years put together. Here is a
table showing the amounts contributed ; :

Easter Colors.
The Easter colors In different parts of
the. world are these:
In Paris, white trimmed with flowers
and lace.
In Vienna, the black hat with- brilliant
trimmings.
. In London, the conservative tones
trimmed with purple and gTay.HpqSnaK*M
. In this country there are daring color
combinations that evoke the admiration
of milliners all over the earth. Â¦
For the first time in the history of
American millinery there is a demand for
the American Easter hat abroad and the
"Imported" hat . is â¢ a feature of the best
establishments of London and Paris. The
American sailor has long been known on
the -other side, but the Easter, hat not
until this year. y . Â¦
The straw hat of . Easter is certainly
odd. It Is chic and very becoming.
There are many varieties of it and you
can take your pick and choice. , But in
them all, and through them all, there- is
the note of oddity.
Take the little straw turban which Is to
bo so much worn. It Is made of satin
straw, curiously, mingled . in a , sort . of
braiding until it Is close and 'secure. T Or
it is made of colored cloth â¢ and straw
braided together. Or it may be of che
nille and straw Intertwined with . a sus
picion of a crocheted stitch. ;;Any and
many a way it is put together/ until Â¦ it
makes a -handsome, firm, material from
which a hat !â¢ built. . . . v ' -:
The shape of the straw turban is circu
lar and turned up all .the way .around
with tho brim nearly ; as high -as - the
crown, yet not quite as high. It is not
the distinct boat shape 'with high -sides
that concer.l* the top, but a boat-shaped

The brim sets out a little and the hat
when laid <Â¦ upon the table is perfectly
round in shape. â¢ But when -you v have
trimmed it there is more diversity.' At
each side you ; have probably caught it up
with a group of bird wings and under the
wings you 'have placed a bunch of velvet.
. . * .-'.. The Easter Turban.
The color, if you "are out for spring
effect,' is ' green'. with scarlet' in > It. > More
like autumn It would seem to use scarlet
in . the? hat- trimming, -but though ; It '. is
spring, you will find: that. there is many. a
touch of the flamingo. â¢ Â¦ â¢â¢- - .-. :
Letthe hat -be- caught' high at each

there is some black; and let the ribbon be,

and we / all ' have ? otir,. poverty spells, â¢ can
banish the blues and come out quite glo
rious - at ] Easter. Let , her hie .' herself . to
the v shop '. and i purchase ' three yards of

yOU will need this year three Easter
hats: A small, round straw tur
ban, grayly trimmed; a neat hat
trimmed with flowers, for calling:
a very effective fluffy, floppy pic
ture hat !; Â¦.'/>;
With these three you can get along
through the Easter month. But the day
has gone by and faded Into ancient his
tory when a woman could buy one hat
and wear it as an Easter hat, .and later
appear In it during all the spring until the
summer.
Consolations there are In the matter of
later adaptlveness. You can make your
Easter picture hat do for garden parties
In August. And, If you are clever, you
Â¦will see how your little straw turban will
answer as a traveling hat and an outing
hat. As for the neat flower-trimmed hat
or toque, it will do for matinees all the
ypricjc and for a calling hat in June when
you ero cut for the P. P. C. calLjâ to tell
people that you are going away.
But it is well to reconcile yourself to
the . fact that you will need three hats
and to make suitable appropriation in
black wings, while violet velvet is twisted
around the crown and .violet velvet sets
off the wings. Â¦ . "~
A startling style of hat is the tri
corne, but you must be stylish to wear it.'.
'Like the new veil, it requires some pecu
liar; charm of manner and carriage of
the head to take it off well. The latest
veil is one that is fastened in the back,
. with a great splashing bow, while ' ends
and loops set each way. Upon one woman
it will look very, nice, but upon another
U will be positively grotesque. So with
(the tricorne hat. It does not become all
Ipeople. "-â¢Â¦-*
i There is a three-cornered or tricorne
hat which looks very well and is pecu
jliarly adapted to traveling use later on.
jit is a hat with very little trimming," but
lit is so-cut in the straw or so bent that
jthe front comes down to a pcalc right over
the nose,' while the sides flare and turn
up a little and are caught with a bunch
I of velvet loops.
An Easter Matinee Hat.
An Easter hat that was no hat at all,
, but' a bow, was sold a few days ago for
'quite -a sum. - It was called a matinee
I toque. It was made out of pink satin
ribbon Â¦ of the color of a; tea rose. The
ribbon was four inches wide. Over it was
stretched black velvet two inches wide,
leaving a margin of nink at each side.
j The whole was tied in a big double bow,
df her spring suit If It be gray, then get
a faintly nickel tone of tulle. If the suit
be blue. then. get white tulle. If It be a
brown, then select a pale coffee-colored
stuff, a cafe au lait tulle. If it be black,
then again have refuge in white. If you
do not like colors at all, choose all black
tulle, which is always ladylike and very
easily handled.
Take tha tulle and lozenga it. This
means cut out circles of black velvet the
size of a dime and attach them, to the
tulle at Intervals of two* Inches. A little
depends upon the style of the woman for
a small person should not attemnt the
daring resultsrof the majestic stylÂ© of
women, but should content herself with
few*r dots.
When the tulle has been lozenged, and
for this there Is really nothing aulte as
modish as a- faint yellow tulle with black
spots, then wind it around the brim of
the hat. Let it go round and round, and
then let It start around the crown. Try
to drase the whole hat with it, without
covering it entirely.
Kaking Tour Easter Hat.
Now take the brim and pick out tha
tulle until it lies in big folds, the lozenges
in plain sight, and let the folds be heavy
and open and soft. Catch them with big
buckles of steel or of silver; or. if you
feel very poor, with nothing at all. But
at one side set a big velvet knot and your
Easter hat wil be complete. It will not
equal a pbsitlvely new one in your own
estimation, but it will fool nine out of
ten persons who view it.
If you wear a veil let it also be dotted,
but for this use the oval, 'long, narrow
ones, sewed on here and there, but never
cover the eye or the tip of the nose.
.The ribbon sash or scarf In the Easter
hat will be among the novel sights. One
hat, a straw with round brim and rather
high crown, is trimmed around the brim
with a long plaid scarf, but the scarf, in
stead of draping the brim or lying In
folds, is threaded In and out In long
stitches around the outer edge of the
brim, four stitches being required to go
around the brim. At the back it is tied
in a bow with ends.
Another scarf is threaded fn and out,
but this one is threaded around the crown
Itself, and for the threading there are big
Etraps of straw, through which the ribbon
is run, like straps upon the face of a piece
of insertion. , The scarf is very wide and
lies In many folds. At one sida It is tied
in many loops and ends.
There are so many ways of using this
sash this season. There is some attempt
to have it hang down at the back in sash
ends, and you do see many hats so treat
ed, but, truth to tell, the style Is not very
becoming to many and it Is positively
prejudicial from a standpoint of good
looks. It certainly takes height and grace
to wear streamers banging down one's
back with good effect, and the woman
without either will do well to consider.
The scarf is used in place of ribbon to
some extent, and pretty it looks in Its
devious windings. It is a' decided adjunct
to any hat of straw design, and no won
der that it is used In such a variety of
ways.
For Easter Automobilingr..
, The automobile hat is something de
serving a chapter by Itself. Hats are
specially built for wearing in steam car
riages, and a clever compromise they are
between the outing hat and the eratwhila
carriage hat.
The big, fluffy hat, worn for carriage
wear, will not do for automobiling, as It
is too soft. It blows out of shape in the
rapid progress of the machine. Neither
will the delicate hat answer, as it will
catch tho dust. Roses and the like are
unsuitable, unless properly treated, and
the auto hat comes to be a thing by
itself.
An automobile hat, worn by the wife
of a Washington diplomat, a handsome
woman, is brown taffeta, tha brim being
a mass of tucks. Roses He under the
brim so that they touch the hair. The
top of the hat has a bed of roses all fas
tened low and securely. Covering tha
roses there is a veil of waterproof ma
line, and the roses under the slda are
protected In the same way.
An automobile hat worn by young Mrs.
Blaine was a tri-corner of navy blue vel
vet as to the brim. The tri-corners were
looped with deep red American Beauty
roses. The top of tha hat was laid in
folds of white taffeta and navy blue
velvet.
Compactness is tha watchword in trim
ming the automobile hat, and, while the
rough and ready straws with their simple
adornment of quills are much more suit
able, they are not considered quite
prettty enough, and you see tha hand
somely trimmed auto hats wherever you
hear the whirr of the wheels.
Easter Smartness.
Â¦ A smart tilt Is given certain of these
driving hats, though the tilt i3 so diffi
cult to keep in place upon the head.
One side is lifted extremely high and
under the high brim there is set a very
large, handsome bunch of velvet or a
little side hill flower bed. Bunches 'of
tulle are- also seen here, and them, art*
little bouquets of ribbon roses with the
utmost semblance to the real roses.
Looking at the hats one is constrained
to wonder if the present vogua for fancy
designs will ever go out and plainness
succeed frivolity. " Unfortunately for
those who desire such an end, the pres
ent styles are becoming, and it is uncer
tain to predict that they. will disappear.
Give a woman something that is becom
ing to her and she will cling to it. even
though the making of it take . all her
time, and tha purchasing of the mate
rials of it all the money in her purse.
' When one thinks of the severe fedoras,
the stiff walking hats, once called Eng
lish, the small square turbans, the hats
that turned up at both sides precisely
alike, and the sauare sailors without a
touch of smartness in their trimming,
then ona shudders and Is constrained to
wonder how in the world, in those days,
any woman at all managed to be pretty,
and one does not marvel at the fact mat
in those austere seasons there were not
more than two or three beauties, whereas
every other woman now calls herself
such.
Easter Picture Hats.
The big brimmed, floppy picture hat
will be a feature. Do not confound it
with the Gainsborough, nor with tha
classic Romney, nor with the Isabey, for
it is nothing of the sort. It is a big,
loosely put together hat.' with roses that
dangle upon the ends of long stems and
bunches of tulle that blow In the breezes
and big veil-like streamers.
These hats are made of tulle, shirred
over a wire frame, or they have for their
foundation a very open lace straw. The
straw is not stiff, but is wavy In the brim,
taking on shapes according to the day
and the desire. These big, floppy shapes
can be pulled down at each side to look
something like a poke: they can be lifted
at the back to give the face an air of
wlstfulness under tha drooping 1 front
brim; they can be raised at one side a
little and a rose set under. Just for the
sake of the picture: or there can be the
complexion rose, which is the big pink
/rose, right over the eyebrow, to set off
the peach tones of the face. .
It is . in ' the bis picture hat that >4ha
greatest coloring is seen, for the Dresden
tones are- used In wonderful color
schemes; and there are pinks and 'blues
and greens. and white that He all together
' in one lovely flower garden all nestling
.in a bed of tulle.
The covered or draped brim, no matter
how wide it is seen, is bent and. twisted
to look well over the face.
Garden party hats come under this class
and they are immense things, mostly in.
white with colored roses. They are get
ting ready for Queen Alexandra's garden
parties, which , are to be features of the
41ew reign; and the most enormous hats of
chiffon and -jeweled .tulle will be set full
of roses, yellow, white and red, to maka
a glorious hat. That will be the Alexan
dra'garden party; hat and will -mark tha
beginning of the /Alexandra' era, even as
certain hats v mark ; the beginning of tha
Victorian era."
ing hat, for one can be very gaudy In
one's Â¦ devotion to Easter. And here one
comes * to a much more intricate treat
ment. "
There Is an Easter bat that Is a rose
hat. It Is ' supplied with a round crown,
covered with roses, not a spot of the hat
showing except the roses; then there are
rolling sides also covered with roses/ and
the front and the back are all roses. A
rose hat it is, with the only trimming con
sisting of a small aigrette in front, with a
rhinestone at the foot of. the aigrette.
Easter, Church. Hats.
Velvet arid chiffon will be much used to
gether. .Chiffon, which has been called
the connecting link between winter and
summer, holds its own - this : season, and
more than holds its own. while velvet slips
in as a companion. Velvet is good every
where, Â¦ and with velvet and chiffon one
cannot go far astray. Easter church hats
are largely of velvet. Â¦ Â¦ â¢
A Gainsborough, not a picture hat, but
a " modified ' Gainsborough, has a wide
brim faced with alternate folds of chiffon
and velvet, the chiffon lying over the vel
vet. The top of the hat, the plateau part,
is covered with -little velvet cords, wound
round and round like chenille. Caught at
the front is a very long, very thick plume,
and this extends over the top of the hat
and falls at the back until It touches the
hair and sweeps it a little.
The ostrich feather, - instead of going
out. Is coming In, and you will see many
a, feather-swept hat. Great, long, curling
ostrich 'Â¦ plumes are fastened at one side
of a -round hat and the plume is allowed
to come across the front | and to fall off
at the ; side, in very pretty style, giving
width to the front of the hat. The plume
may curl thickly, and cover the hat with
Its , close tendrils. -
â¢ The Â¦ ;llttle flat-topped , hat of shirred
tulle is another medium for the ostrich
feather. It may be .la>ge. without "being:
large . enough to be a picture hat, while
right -in the middle of the top is a circle
of : lace.' Around- the brim there curls a
plume, \yhich Â¦ is carried all the way
front, : over : the right side and down the
back until it gracefully caresses the neck.
The manner in which this is applied sug
gests the way In which a boa is worn
around - the throat â tossed carelessly
around. .
Eastsr Calling Hats.
. There are hats almost of nothing 1 but
one curling feather, which conceals every
thing else from a front view and leaves
very little to be seen from the back ex
cept-an" openwork crown, very low and
very '. flat.
-Among the smart calling hats, or thea
ter^ hats, 1 may be mentioned' the acorn
hat. This is a round affair of white tulle
with softjy draped brim, the whole lying
in .many folds. Over the white chiffon
there : are laid large green velvet oak
leaves, cut out and appllqued, one by one
upon the chiffon,' until the crown and
brim are all covered.
' A long brown stem finds Its way across
the top of the hat. At one side there is
a mass of acorns, with brown cups, shad
ins into green.
A hat of light tan chiffon wa3 lifted at
one side, while the whole top and brim
was a mass of the chiffon. Big dots of
black velvet trimmed the chiffon. Under
the lifted side there were folds of white
velvet, edged with black velvet, and these
were arranged like leaves, so that their
edges lay as though they were the Ieave3
of a book. .
Another hat- had a top of gray velvet.
The front was covered with a mass of
tulle and, right in the middle of the front,
-there were - two big r American Beauty
roses with .their leaves.. Â¦ -.,

Yet as the story proceeds the reader can

"Shacklett," a novel by Walter Barr,
is described in the sub-title as "the evo
lution of a statesman." An exception may
well be taken to applying the epithet
"statesman" to the hero of the story.
Still, as the history of a man who was a
very astute politician, even if he .did not
deserve the more dignified title, the story,
is entertaining. When Noel .Shacklett
first appears in this history he is a young
farmer, living with his : : widowed mother
in a small town in Illinois. Shacklett 1 s
father had in his lifetime held the offlco
of Sheriff. The elder Shacklett had. had
a great liking for politics. - He . was, on
the whole, a . man in whose nature good
rather than evil predominated. Yet there
was in him a strong bias toward evil, it
was due to the influence of his wife, a
woman "of noble nature, . that ' Sheriff
Shacklett was kept - in â¢ an undeviating
path of rectitude. Noel Shacklett, the
eon, has inherited nature: of both
parents. It is the conflict of the warring
elements in him that the author makes a
prominent, feature of the, story. Noel
fcshacklett, from a modest participation in
the political life of his native town, be
comes in time, a figure; of importance in,
national politics. When Noel is still a
very young, man, a lawyer from the town,
in which he lives secures for him a clerk

"Corporations In California," by Charles

This little volume Is a concise treatise,
covering all branches of the existing law
of California relating to private corpora
tions, including foreign corporations, to
gether with a statement of the conditions
under which foreign corporations can do
business in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, Ore
gon and Washington. In a brief preface,
Mr. Son sets forth the purpose of ' his
work. He says, In part: "Part II of the
book contains in full the text of all stat
utes of California, now in force, relating
to private corporations. The arrangement
of these statutes is one of the features of
the book. They are classified under the
same classification as 13 used In the main
portion of the book, so that there Is col
lected under each heading all the statute
law of the State relating to its subject,
whether such law is found in the Session
Laws, the Codes or the Constitution.
Thus, -by means of the index, the reader
can readily turn to all' the statute law
on the subject he has in mind, while by
means of the table of statutes, the judicial
'construction of such statute law Is at his
command.

Mr. Smith quotes some lines written by
Charles Keeler, the poet and scientist,
which will find an echo in the heart of
all who love our State flower: .
"Oh, ye who love gold, go forth to the
fields and find it. There may ye behoM
the meadows bossed with the living gold
and the hills carpeted therewith. It Is
gold beyond all price. To look upon it
enriches. It cannot corrupt, and he who
hoards it is no miser with his stores. El
Dorado is found, and its treasure is for
all. Men of toil and women of care, the
hills and fields are thy comforters; 'go to
them and find the golden poppy. The blua
sky is over it: the birds sing around it:
cherMh it; cherish and love all the sweet
things that nature has provided for ye,
and behold, ye shall be eternally blessed."
The volume is attractively printed and
bound. It has the distinction of being the
first book ever published upon any State
or national floral emblem. (Published by
the author at Palo Alto, Cal. Price $1 50.)
explorers (by some the legend embraces
the name of Father Junipero Serra) ex
claimed as he saw the golden poppy: 'At
last I have found the Holy Grail!' and
laising aloft the perfect cup he reverently
touched his lips to the rim of the 'calce

"Edward E. Hale in the 'Queen of Cali
fornia' speaks of receiving a letter from
Starr King in which he wrote of seeing
through a telescope the color of Mount
Diablo, thirty-eight miles away, change
when the eschscholtzias were in bloom."

aNDER the title, "The Golden
Poppy." Emory E. Smith has writ
ten an exhaustive work on the
State flower of California. Mr.
Smith has at the cost of great
pains gathered from every available
source Information upon the history of the
poppy as it appears in science, literature
and art. Apparently he has said about
the f.ower every interesting thing which
could be said. The book is illustrated by
a large number of photographs and by
cuts, which ehow the structure of the
flower, cr which present different views
in which Us graceful outlines form a
prominent feature of the scene. A colored
reproduction of a water-color drawing by
Paul de Longpre forms a very attractive
frontispiece. In speaking of the first
Ecientinc classification of the poppy, Mr.
bmith quotes from a' paper delivered by
Professor Volney Rattan before the Pa
cific States Floral Congress May 16, 1831:
"In 1U15 Count Romauzolt, a Russian
nobleman, fitted out the 6hip KurÂ«k,
â¢which he sent on an exploring expedition
under the command of Captain Otto von
Kotzebue, who was expected to lind, if
possible, a passage north of America con
necting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
In the interest of science- Adelbert von
Chamisso was made botanist of the ex
pedition, John Frederick Eschscholtz sur
geon and naturalist and Choris artist.
"C'hamisEo, who -was then 34 years old,
had just published an original story, since
translated into several languages, entitled
'Peter Schlemlhl.' This amusing story
cf a man who sold his shadow gave him
fame abroad, but he Is better known to
Germans, by his lyric poetry and ballads,
as well as by his scientific v.*ork. Esch-
Bcholtz, but 21 years old, had already ac
quired some distinction as a naturalist;
but Choris. two years younger, had such
ability as enabled him in the after years
of his short lite to become one of the dis
tinguished historical painters of Russia.
ICotzebue, then 28 years of age, was a son
of a great German dramatist, whose plays
were in his time the most popular in the
world.
"After exploring the west and south
coasts of Alaska. Kotzebue came down
the coast and entered San Francisco Bay
October 2, ISIS. Chamisso and Eschscholtz
spent a month exploring this peninsula
and in making expeditions to Monterey,'
Mission San Jose and Bodega. Meanwhile
Choris drew and painted the aborigines
and other subjects new to European eyes.
With many other plants, they secured
specimens of the eschscholtzia, which
Â¦were the first to reach Europe.
"Upon their return Chamisso and
Eschscholtz began to study the botanical
and zoological specimens collected during
their long voyage and from time to time
they published descriptions of new species
of plants and animals. It was some time
in 1S20 before Chamisso published a de
scription of our State flower."
Those who have hesitated io use the
formidable botanical name -of the poppy
will be interested in reading what the au
thor says of it and of the more popular
name:
"So far as available records show, no
plant in history has been endowed with
such a superfluity of names as Califor
nia's Golden Poppy. These names are
many of them most happily applied. They
are so varied In language and definition
that it has seemed expedient to classify
them under the nationalities from which
they have been derivedâ German, Latin,
Greek, Spanish. English and Italian.
"No matter how much we in the past
have been inclined to rebel against the
Latinized German name Eschscholtzia, it
Is the proper botanical name of our State
flower. It is in accordance with the
botanical law of priority laid down at the
conventions of Paris and Rochester. The
objection to the word is almost entirely,
attributable to a general misconception of
its pronunciation, for which the public is
not so much responsible as the earlier
California writers, who ill advisedly used
the harsh, discordant pronunciation es
kolsia, es-kolshy or eskoltz-e-a.
"The correct English pronunciationâ
that given in standard dictionaries, ency
clopedia and botanical works, is esh
eholt-Ei-a. If spoken thus, sounding the
sch In both syllables like sh, with the ac
cent on the second syllable and the long
sound of the vowel, the word is not harsh
or difficult, but soft and euphonious. It is
Improper- to avoid its use, and it is best
to familiarly and correctly speak it upon
all necessary occasions- If this is done it
will soon take its place among our loved
household words. â¢ â¢ *
"California Poppy, or Golden Poppy,
Â¦while to a botanist incorrect and a little
exasperating, is the name the people
love best and the name which will cling
to our State flower for all time. The pub
lic mind is not always logical In its.se
lection of names, but when a choice Is
once made it it can rarely be changed,
and golden poppy it will remain when the
flower's bright petals form a golden pall
upon the forgotten sod under which our
disputes have long since been laid."
* A large portion of the book is devoted
to citation of poems written to extol th*
charm of the poppy. Amon^ these one of
the finest Is by Edwin Markham andJs
entitled
IN POPPY FIELDS.
Here the poppy hosts assemble.
How they startle, how they tremble;
All their royal hoods unpinned.
Blow out llrhtly In the wind.*
Men that In tbe cities grind
Come, before the heart is blind.
Here is rold to labor for;
Here Is pillage worth a war.
An idea of the contents of the remain
ing portion of the book may be gained
from the titles of some of the chaptersâ
"Species and Distribution." "Allied Gen
era," "Cultural." "Economic Uses,"
"Graphic and Decorative Art." "Indian
Lore" and "Historical Incidents."
The following interesting Items are
taken from different parts of the book: ,
"When the rush for gold first began In
California the Indians are said to have
expressed the belief that the petals of the
"Great Spirit Flower' (the golden poppy)
dropping year after year, sank into thÂ»
earth and gradually formed the bright
metal for which the strangers were
searching."
"Although one of the newest States.
and for many years one of the most un
stttled socially. California waa the first in
the Union to proclaim a State flower."

With the February issue, the Bookman
closes the seventh year of Its existence.
In this number will be found the first of
a aeries of articles dealing with the great
newspapers of the United States. This
paper tells the story of the evolution of
American Journalism and the development
of the great historic newspapers of New
York during the first half of the century
and until the outbreak of the War of Se
cession. It treats of a time when the
press was essentially personal: when peo
ple asked one another, not "What does the
Herald say, or the Tribune say this
morning?" but "What does Greeley think
of this, or Bennett say of that?" Amer
ican journalism in the '30*3 was roundl;*
scored by Charles Dickens In "AmericanV
Notes" and "Martin Chuzzlewit," and tlu^
story of how newspapers were conducted
In that day, the record of the savage per
sonalities, the abuse and the violence,
gives a curious Insight into the conditions
which aroused Dickens' animosity seventy
years ago. In connection with the second
Installment of Vlcomte de Louvenjoul's
"History of Balzac and Madame Hanska,"
the Bookman reproduces what are prob
ably the most curious and typical Balzac
illustrations that have ever appeared In
this country. Among them la a fac
simile of the original scenario of "Le
| Pere Gorlot," and from this page people
who have read the book may trace the
curious development of the story In
Balzac's mind. Another page, presenting
the various coats-of-arms of different
. families of the comedie humalne, shows
the immense labor with which Balzac
builded the background for his Imaginary
men and women. Among other features
of this. number are the concluding paper
on "Boston, in Fiction." which deals with
Cambridge, Roxbury and other literary
environs of the Massachusetts capital,
and the first paper of a new series of
articles on "Literary, Artistic and Bo
hemian London In the Seventies."
"Jefferson was passionately fond of good
horses." writes "William E. Curtis In hia
new, book, "The True Thomas Jefferson."
"We generally worked mules on the plan
tation, but he would not ride or drive any
thing but a high-bred horse." Hi3 over
seer Is quoted as saying of Jefferson:
. **Bay was his preference for color. He
would not have any other. After he came
from Washington he had a fine carriage
built at Montlcello, from a model that he *
planned himself. The woodworking, black
smithing and painting were all done by
his own workmen. He had the plating
done at Richmond. "When he traveled in
this carriage he always had five horses
four in the carriage and the fifth for Bur
well, who always rode behind him. Thosa
five horses were Diomede, Brimmer, Te
cumseh, Wellington and Eagle. In his
new carriage, with fine harness, those four
horses made a fine appearance. He never
trusted a driver with the lines. Two ser
vants rode on horseback and each guided
his own pair. About once a year Mr.
Jefferson . used to go to Montpeller and
spend several days with Mr. Madison ; and
everv summer he went to Poplar Forest,
his farm in Bedford, and spent two or
three months."

lived about a mile farther on. The Su
perintendent accompanied me and com
menced by asking the simplest questions
in arithmetic. Finally he asked me what
the New Hampshire interest law was.
The answer was apparently not satisfac
tory, for the Superintendent turned to his
fellow examiner and said: 'I think it of
no use to go any further with the exam
ination, for this is the third snag I have
struck. (I was surprised, as I had thought
It plain sailing so far.) 'That school at
Dutch Flat is the most difficult one in
the county, and we want a man that
knows something there.'
" 'I think we better proceed,' said the
ether examiner. *I have not noticed any
snags at ail in the young man's answers.' .
"The Superintendent then turned to me
and asked, 'What did you do before you
came here?* I told him that I had been
a. civil engineer. 'Well, then, that re
quires a knowledge of higher mathe
matics.' Then turning to the other ex
aminer hs said, 'I guess the young man
is better able to examine us than we are .
to examine him, and with your permls
tlon 1 move that we grant him a first
grade certificate.' And so ended the ex
amination.
"The following Monday morning I was
installed as teacher at Dutch Flat and
Â¦began my work in the public schools of
this State. As the pupils had driven away
the former teacher, much interest was
felt as to my fate, and I suddenly found
"myself the center of attention. 'Â¦Â¦ ',
"If I live to be as old as Methuselah and
teach to the finish, I shall never forget
that first week of school at Dutch Flat.
The larger boys had banded themselves
together and had '. planned , not to attend
school at first, till they_could find out
how the school was conducted; then they
were going to come and 'run ' the new
teacher out.'. When tbe four leaders came
they were armed with small clubs up
their sleeres. They were big fellows, all
stronger than I. They looked at me
sneeringly and Immediately- proceeded to
violate the rules. I told them to remain
in at recess, but the ringleader got up
and said he guessed he would go out
when he chose. I knew the decisive mo
ment had come. I was standing' beside
the desk with a blackboard pointer in my
hand. The next Instant I swung around
and hit him on the head and laid 1 him
prostrate on the floor. One of his com
panions attempted to come to his rescue, Â¦
but I served him , in the same manner.
The rest became alarmed and kept Quiet.
This apparently brutal lesson had the
most salutary effect. Not a sign of oppo
sition was manifest during the remainder
of the term, and the. parents came and
thanked me for my prompt action arid
assured me that they would stand by me.
"Singing was introduced into the school
and it pleased the people of the town so
much that they insisted upon getting up
a singing schocl. A committee ".was : ap-'
pointed and the class' was to meet three
times a week and I was appointed teacher
at tiOO a month. The first night I. went
to the school with dire misgivings. "When
I arrived an- overflow meeting was held
on the outside of the schoolhouse; the in
terior was so crowded. They raised- a
cheer when I took iny place and that gave
me courage. Many had never sung a
note, while a large . number had belonged
to advanced singing societies in the East.
So we determined to divide the class and
give the first hour to the beginners and
tbe last hour to the advanced class. The
interest kept up all winter and culminated
in an invitation from . the Methodist
church asking the school to act as a choir.
So when I , left Dutch Flat to ', go ' to the
American River district I left my singing
school Installed as a choir!

FORTY years of successful school
teaching and at it yet! This is the
record of Alexander McDonald, who
for the last twenty of his forty
years' experience has had super
vision over the Lincoln Evening School of
this city. This school, by the way. is the
largest public evening school pn the West
ern Hemisphere. It has an attendance of
1600 pup!ls.
Quite different is this up-to-date night
school from the one in which McDonald
v.-as first tried out and yet the mettle that
won the day In the trials of his vocation
in the early 50' s is still to the fore: for
many and varied are the needs of 1CW
ambitious souls.
During the gold excitement, at Moores
Flat, a mining camp In the Sierras, half
a dozen of the boys decided to brush up
their knowledge in the evenings, and
Aleck McDonald, a fellow miner, was
chosen master. Hanging around the bar.
gambling and telling yarns had become
tiresome, and when Aleck consented to
teach them the news spread enthusiasti
cally through the mining camp. The boys
took gladly to this new and prontable di
version.
McDonald's early experiences are unicjue
and can best be told in his own v.crds.
"I had taught a few terms in Nova Sco
* tia and my fame as a speller dov.-n to .
cipherer had preceded me. The boys came
vith an cppalling variety of text-books,
more, I venture, than have been seen in
one classroom before or since. The second -
night the cabin was filled to overflowing
and it looked as though we "would be
obliged to turn away a score or more of
husky students. The most spacious room
in camp was called Into use. Arithmetic
and spelling were the studies chosen.
Each selected the part of the arithmetic
he wished to digest and the old Sacra
mento Union speller was agreed upon as
the spelling text-book.
"The new educational movement 'took*
in tho mining camp. Here congregated
night after night ignorant men and grad
uates from Eastern colleges and men who
had fled to California to escape punish
ment for crime. Sometimes discussions
would arise on some of the more advanced
subjects and many a night I had to burn
the midnight ell to keep ahead of my
clasp, for I had been obliged to advance
the course of study to fit the needs of my
pupils and I think we had a little of every
thing in that school, from the three R's
(readin'. 'ritin' and 'rithmetic) to loga
rithms and solid geometry.
"As a result of the discussions a regu
lar debating society was oifeanized. Here
all variety of subjects were taken up,
from Questions of local claims and Gov
ernment to of social and national
import. On' one occasion the teacher of
an adjoining school district challenged my,
school for a. spelling match. My miners
studied np night and day. "While they
were Cigging for gold they used to put
wcrds to one another and when the affair
came eff try school triumphed. I was
very proud of this, for it gave us prestige
in the community.
""In 1SC1 I wa3 requested to teach a pri
vate school at Dutch Flat. After the first

One of ' the saddest incidents of the fire was the death of Mrs. Salome 'Foo
ter. .. the t'Tombs. Angel," who for fifteen years . has done service in'behalf of
female prisoners in the Tombs and . other city prisons. Mrs.' Foster was tha
widow of John W; Foster, and had lived : for the last five years at. the Park
Avenue Hotel. Her income, which atone time was considered large,: was. for
the most ; part expended upon the deserving poor. ' ,'p, / ,
S. S. Granger "of Seattle, who had been a guest at: the hotel for three days,
has this to say of the fire: "I was in a room on the second floor front, facing
. Park avenue. About- 1:30 o'clock, I was awakened by. the noise and excitement
that attended the burning, of the armory. ; I went down into the hall and met
a. man hastening- through the ; corridor. He said to me, without -piy asking a
question: 'Don't worry; this hotel is fireproof. There is no danger.'
' " 'There is always danger,' I said. 'I lost my wife ten years ago by -â¢ fire In
a Nebraska hotel, and I , am going out as ' fast as I can.' I. went to my room
and gathereda few things together. The flre in the armory at that time being
extinguished and the danger becoming less, I remained in my room for over an
hour, and then I hastened downstairs. Soon afterward the flames werfe dis
"" covered in the' hotel. There was no notification and no rapping by any of the
hotel Â¦ employes that I heard." . :â¢. ; ; '. ... ~ . :. ; Â»-,-, . . .
Norman Acton, a mine-owner of Colorado Springs, lost his life in the flre.
He was the largest stockholder: In the Colorado Mining and Milling Company.
!He had been at the hotel only a short time. William Pears, the London rep
resentative of the Oro Cobre Company, called at Bellevue Hospital, where Acton
died, and identified the dead man as his business associate. It is said that Ac
ton was worth $5,000,000. ' .; .., , : > .

Frederick K. Reed, manager of the hotel, said: "The minute the flre started
In the hotel I summoned all available men and sent them through the halls to
give warning. I cannot see how any one could have failed to have been aroused
bythe .bells that were rung from the office. I went upstairs and got my wife,
who was on the fourth floor, and descended with her to the street in safety.
Then I went to the roof, and when I found that the flames were becoming dan
gerous I descended for my own safety. The fire unquestionably started in
some way in the bottom of the elevator shaft. . I believe that the fire .was , of
Incendiary origin and in no way contingent on the flre In the armory building."
Reed was himself burned about the face and neck, and after he had been at
tended by an ambulance surgeon directed affairs in person. â¢
Fire Commissioner Sturgis said that he was at the scene of the armory; fire
until 2:15 a. m., and that when he left there 'was no flre in the Park Avenue Ho
tel. He said further:, Â¦: . ' >.. -Â¦ y . â¢. â¢ - :
**I believe the hotel flre to have been a. separate and distinct fire, and that It
started in the elevator shaft. I was surprised to learn that there was no flre ap
i paratus and no means of escape in the building. Had the building been nine,
stories in height we would have had jurisdiction, . and the building -department
would have compelled the manager to have- standpipes and the other necessary
fire apparatus. " But this building, having only seven stories,* escapes the law. The
flre department is free from all responsibility for the lack of flre appliances. It
was supposed to be a thoroughly flre-proof building."
Fire Chief Croker said: "I believe that the fire in the hotel was separate and
distinct from that which destroyed the armory, and the hotel d'd not catch flre
from any sparks that came from the armory. The flre originate in the basement
and spread through the elevator shaft to the upper floors. The fact that the hotel
was practically fire-proof was responsible for the the fact that a greater con
flagration'was averted." Â¦' ' .' 'â¢
Police Captain' John Delaney Eaid he was positive that the origin of the flre
was due, to flying sparks from the armory, and to nothing else. . -

the actions of the Embassadors of the
powers at Washington. April 7 and 14,

repetition of the Berlin Reichsanzeiger's
statement on the subject. The Russian
statement concludes as follows:
Private dispatches received here from
Barcelona deny that there is any prob
ability of a settlement, and say the strik
ers are leaving the city in large numbers.
It is certain that the socialists are now
endeavoring to minimize their share in
the disturbances and to lay the whole
blame for the rioting upon the anarchists.
According to messages received here
from Barcelona the police of thaUdty
have captured documents showing that
London- anarchists furnished a consider
able amount of funds to the strikers and
aided in organizing the outbreak there.
Much alarm is felt at Valladolid, where
the bakers threaten to strike. At Seville
evidences have been found of an orga
nized attempt ta precipitate a fresh con
flict between, the strikers and the troops.
The Senate and : Chamber j of . Deputies
were to-day presented with several reas
suring telegrams by the Minister of the
Interior, Senor Gonzales, to the effect
that the strike hr Tarragona was ended
and that tranquillity prevails at Sabadell.

His wife, more sensitively organized and
more powerfully Influenced by â¢ Intuitive
Impressions, regarded Ismar's -warning as
a portent of impending' disaster and
begged him to. remain on land; begged as
only a serious-minded,' fear-wrought
woman can begâ with tears on her cheeks
and all the energy that a woman of sensi-
tive mind and nerves can put into plead-
ing; but all to no purpose. "Manlike, he
had made up his mind to two things:
First, to go on the Walla Walla, and sec-
ond, to treat the warning of Ismar as a
Jest. The sequence shows conclusively
that Ienxar's power to read future events
Is wholly dependable and trustworthy:
that if you are about to take an unusual
step; are about to embark in a new
undertaking; are contemplating even such
commonplace enterprises as business.
matrimony or speculation, her advice is
positively of the utmost value. Her In-
sight into all the intricate details of palm-
istry, physiognomy, physiology, psychol-
ogy and phrenology is so thorough that
when combined with her unequaled clair-
voyant endowments she is easily the most
dependable counselor and delineator of
future events. Her power as a clairvoy-
ant and seeress has been proved time
after time in San Francisco, where she
has resided for years. She needs no for-
eign recommendations or testimonials
but hundreds of people in this city have
tried and proved her marvelous gifts. She
can be consulted dally on all affairs *of

develops that after receiving the warning
mentioned he flippantly related Ismar's
words to his wife and several friends, and
Just before departing took up a glass of

Interior refused to be drawn into the dis
cussion, but' he committed. himself to the
somewhat unexpected statement that he
was "prepared, in accordance with Prus

royal decision which was not agreeable to
himself," and that he would "leave the
house. to draw Its own conclusions of his
conduct.. . â¢. .
â¢ Referring to a remark by. the Minister
yesterday, Richter said he thanked God
that the Radicals had 'not. reached the
point of matching their strength against
that of the King. He also thanked God
that the counry had so valiant a Minister
of the Interior. But recent incidents be
tween the municipality and the crown .had
made bad -blood and had only improved
the prospects of social democracy.
Ministerial responsibility, Richter said,
was a Prussian tradition, but Baron von
Hammerstein was desirous of escaping
therefrom. If the Ministers had nothing
to do but countersign royal decrees they
did not differ from, ordinary clerks.' 1 -;/;'.'
Richter, the Radical leader, had kept the

Sedgwick street, owned by Dr. - George

A petition has been prepared and Is be
ing circulated in all large cities , of the
United States. Copies have also been for
warded to be circulated in the provinces
of China. Men in this country have sent
copies of the proposed law and their peti
tion to their friends and relatives at
home. A concerted effort seems to be on
foot to secure relief from what the Chl
ncso consider unnecessary severity. China
has several times acceded to the request
of America to amend the treaty in the
hitter's favor, and the Chinese think that
more liberal treatment should be shown
them. No great opposition will be made
to the exclusion of coolies of China, but
to regulations which apply to merchants.
On Friday he enunciated this policy
definitely. Under the leadership of Lung
Hok Sou, secretary of the Jon Wah Kon
Show, or the Chinese Merchants' Associa
tion, a concerted move was being made
by the leading merchants of this country
to get the Chinese Government to pursue
Wu's policy.
Retaliation against Americans in China,
in case Congress passes a more stringent
exclusion law against the Chinese than
is now on the statute book, is the request
of a monster petition now being circu

the principal cities of the West and East.
Several weeks ago, ln a committee-room
of Congress, where the hearing was being
given on the MItchell-Kahnbill, the pro

Wu intimated that if the bill became a

NEW YORK. Feb. 22.â That it was no
idle threat made by Wu Ting Fang, Chi

during the controversy with former Mayor
James D. Phelan of San. Francisco he
exclaimed, "We'll keep Americans out of
China," is shown by the united action of
the Chinese merchants here.

WASHINGTX5N, Feb. 22.â The Republi
can members jj of the Ways and Means
Committee, who have been considering
the question of concessions to Cuba at
several /meetings during the week,
reached, r an agreement "'this afternoon
which is considered a victory for those
who have favored tariff concessions 'to
that island. The action taken was the
adoption of the following resolution:
'.Resolved, That It i* the sense of the ma
jority members of this committee (subject to
the approval of the Republican members of
the House in caucus assembled, to be held as
Boon as practicable) that the committee report
a bill in substance authorizing the President
to negotiate a reciprocity treaty with the.Cu
ban republic, when established, providing -for
the entry of our products into Cuba upon such
terms as . shall be deemed by him to be ad
vantageous to us; provided, however, that such
treaty shall; secure for our products going Into
Cuba duties leas than those allowed to the
other countries, substantially equivalent to the
concession made by us; that the consideration
upon our part for such treaty shall be a con
cession of 20 per cent of our tariff duties upon
imports of the products of ! Cuba, upon thia
condition:. That .Cuba shall first enact our
immigration laws. " . "
By the terms of, this, resolution the
proposition agreed on by the Republican
members "of the committee will ..be sub
mitted'to a Republican, caucus to be held
next Tuesday. This action is practically
the proposition submitted, a few days ago
by Representative Long of Kansas, ' ex
cept that the amount of the concession is
cut in half and the condition precedent,
that Cuba enact our immigration Jaws, is
added. .Â» :.. -

"I 'agree with every word uttered by

the moment confined to Roscommon. in
volves a. principle of vital interest to Ire
land. - If the : ; De - Freyne tenants succeed
it will be impossible for. the Government
to resist any longer our claims for the
settlement of Â¦ the Irish land ( question.
The whole future of the Irish national
movement is seriously affected by â¢ the
struggle proceeding on the De Freyne and
neighboring estates." .
"The cause of all the trouble is. the
Government's refusal to face the unani-'
mous demand of the ( Irish people that it
pass legislation giving- compulsory power
to buy out landlords and thus restore the
land to the Irish people. Lord Dillon's
estate, which is next to Lord de Freyne's,
was bought out by the Government and
the tenants who bought the land are pay
ing 50 per cent less rent than formerly.
The De-Freyne tenants naturally wish. to
do likewise, but Lord de Freyne refused
to sell at any terms, The Government, in
stead of endeavoring to effect a settle
ment, poured in an army of police."
John Dillon, the former chairman of the
Irish party, said:' / â¢ Â¦-
VNot only are forty tenants turned out,
but many hundreds are being proceeded
against.. The country. thereabouts is alive
with police, who patrol the roads day and

of the district have been imprisoned mere

Government are so extraordinary that we
cannot help feeling anxious lest violence

Gentlemen: -It gives me gTeat pleasure to add my testimonial to that of hua
dreds of -others iegaxdlng the wonderful curative properties of Swamp-Root, i
had a lame back three years ago before * leaving North Dakota for the coast.
Soon after my arrival in the Puget Sound country it became very -much worse.
I felt certain- that the coast climate had given me acute rheumatism and cams
to the conclusion that I could not live in this climate. Later I became convinced
that what I really had was kidney trouble, and that the rheumatism was due to>
my kidney trouble. The -lameness in my back increased rapidly and I had other
symptoms which Indicated that I would soon be prostrated unless I obtained
relief quickly. Noticing your offer of a sample bottle of Swamp-Root, free. I
had a friend write for one and began taking it immediately. Within three weeks
the lameness in my back began to disappear. During that fall and winter
I took Â¦ three one-dollar bottles .of Swamp-Root, with the result that I be-
came completely cured. I no longer have pains in my back and can exercise
violently without feeling any bad effects. I have recommended Swamp-Root to
several of my acquaintances who were similarly affected and without exception
they have been greatly benefited by its use.

Scarcely had he resumed his seat when there occurred 'one of the most sensa
tional scenes ever witnessed ln the history >of the United States Senate. 1 "Â¦-.:.â¢'
Pale to the lips and trembling with the emotion which. in vain he endeavored
to control, McLaurln of South Carolina rose and addressed the Senate, speaking
to a question of personal privilege. Instantly a hush fell over. the SenatÂ° airi over
Hi? thronged galleries. The very atmosphere seemed charged -with excitement,
with breathless interest the auditors, both on the floor and in the galleries, hung
upon every word uttered by the South Carolina Senator. Despite the emotion un
der which be labored McLaurin seemed to be the calmest man in the chamber.
He spoke with deliberation, and his enunciation- was clear and distinct. Every
word he uttered seemed to be felt as well as heard in the remotest part -of the
historic old hall. > *\ '- -
. . Mr - President," he began, #< I rise to a question of. -personal privilege." He
had voiced less than a dozen words, yet the excitement by this time had become
Intense. AH seemed to realize that a nortentous event was about to happen. Sen
ator Scott of "West Virginia moved restlessly about in the rear of the chamber/
and Assistant Sergeant-at-arms Layton rose from his seat as If to listen the better
to what was about to be said. ti
"During my absence," continued McLaurin, "a few moments ago from the
Senate chamber in attendance upon the Committee on Indltfn ,Affairs the Sen
ator who has just taken his seat (Tillman) said improper influences had been
used in changing the vote of somebody on that treaty, and then went on later
and said that it applied to the Senator from South Carolina who had been given
the patronage in that State. I think I got the sense of the controversy.'.' J :
Still controlling himself with an effort, but still speaking very calmly and
with a. carefully modulated tone, McLaurin said, and his words cut through
the Senate chamber, like a knife:
"I desire to state. Mr. Presidentâ I would not use as strong language as I
intend had I not, soon after the Senrte met, replied to these insinuations and
said they were untrue. ' â¢ â¢, â¢ Â« ... -.- ..-;, v ,.'Â« <
"I now say," continued McLaurin, with distinct emphasis upon every word,
and half turning toward his colleague, Tillman, who sat in the same row only
three seats away,."that the statement is a willful, malicious and deliberate lie."
McLaurin got no further with his statement.
j..' TIHP an. who was occupying his regular seat on the main aisle, sprang, with
tiger-like ferocity at his colleague. Teller of Colorado, who was sitting at his
desk between the two South Carolina Senators, was swept aside- without cere
mony. Indeed, the Infuriated Tillman climbed over him in his effort to reach
McLaurin. Without .the slightest hesitation McLaurin sprang to meet the at
tack half way. Tillman aimed a wild blow at .his colleague with his right
fist It landed upon' McLaurin's forehead just above the/left eye, although its
force was partially spent upon McLaurin's arm, which he had raised in an "ef
fort to parry the blow.
Instantly McLaurin's right arm shot out, the blow landing upon Tillman's
face, apparently upon the nose. Again Tillman struck out frantically, this time
with his left band. The blow did not land upon McLaurin. Then followed a wild
scrimmage, both Senators clutching at each other madly. .
Senators Warren and Scott, both of whom are powerful men, rushed toward '
the combatants to separate them. . ,. r '
Assistant Sergeant at Arms Layton sprang over desks in his effort to reach the
belligerent Senators. Just as he seized McLaurin, Tillman aimed a left-hand
blow at his colleague, which-struck Layton in the face. Fortunately- the blow
was glancing and did no special harm. Layton tore them apart. Both Senators
were still striking wildly at each other, some of the blows â¢
An instant later the angry Senators
were pinioned in the arms of Senators
Warren and Scott. They were dragged
further apart, although they still made
ineffectual efforts to get at each other,
Finally they were forced into their seats,
McLaurin.'although, very pale, seemed
to l>e the calmer of the two. Tillman was
as white a a sheet. As he sat down in
his seat he drew his handkerchief from
his pocket and wiped blood from his face,
that seemingly was flowing from the
landing upon Layton.

After some discussion" it was arranged,
at the suggestion of Lodge, in charge of
the Philippine bill, that discussion of the
measure should be resumed, McLaurin of
Mississippi desiring to address the Senate.
J McLaurin then took the floor in oppo
sition to the pending 'measure. He de
nounced the method of the majority and
declared that the policy was detrimental
to the -best interests of the United States.
The Senae fhen. at 6:30 p. m., took a re
cess until 8 o'clock.
As McLaurln uttered' the last sentences
of his speech; intimating that if there was
any farther effort to press upon him the'
accusations which had been made against
him there might be trouble, there was an
evident stir in the chamber. Several Sen
ators rose to their feet, as if half-expect
ing a renewed outbreak t>f trouble. Bacon
of Georgia and Patterson of Colorado,
both of whom were sitting near McLau
rin, urged him to stop where he was, Pat
terson saying: "I beg the Senator to re

"I will refrain, then, Mr. President,"
said McLaurin.

Drs. Shores caution the sick to not pay out another dollar to any doctor for treatment
or medicines until you are satisfied that the doctor you elect to treat you is qualified by ex-
perience and learning- to cure you. When a doctor <or some medical concern) tells you they
can cure you. ask them who they have cured that were sick like yourself. If a doctor curea
others ,he can cure you. If a doctor, by any SUBTERFUGE, is not willing that you may
know. whether he is SKILLKDor not in the treatment of your kind of ailment, the chances
are ten to one, he is INCOMPETENT to treat you. or is a MEDICAL FAKIR. Take no
man's unsupported word that he cures DEAFNESS. CATARRH and CHRONIC DISEASES.

Ordinary coughs cannot last over night.
Croup germs are destroyed in thirty
minutes .after the first inhalation.
Bronchitis ls cured in forty-eight hours.
Catarrh ln from one to three weeks,
and that dread disease, consumption, in
sixty days.
It ls very easy to understand wny wnen
you know that HTOMEI is the only ger-
micide that will km the germs of theaa
diseases, and which can be Inhaled in the
air we breathe, the only possible way of
reaching these germs.
If you are in doubt about the efficacy of this
new remedy, send to The K. T. Booth Co,.
Ithaca, N. Y.. for five days' treatment, free,
or go to your drug-gist and purchase an Outfit.
The Inhaler will last you a lifetime and 50c
will supply you with sufficient HTOMEI for a
month's constant use.
It has been a long and most - difficult
task to convince the public that cough
syrups, expectorants and other drug3
taken into the stomach do not and can-
not destroy the germs of diseases located
ln the head, throat and lungs, but when
the last reporf-of the Bureau of Vital
Statistics was published, showing that
HTOMEI had reduced the death rate from
consumption alone 34 per cent during the
past year, and when this was followed by
an editorial in the United States Health
Reports, stating that this reduction was
caused solely by HTOMEI, and that no
other remedv or treatment had anv-
thine whatever to do 'with it. then,
and not until then, did the people awake
to the fact that It was a useless waste
of time and money to attempt the perma-
nent cure of such diseases without de-
stroying the causeâ germs.
WITH THIS LITTLE INHALER
"VVlthln the past three months over sixty
thousand people have stopped tLe use of
stomach medicines and are deper-dln? en-
tirely upon the new germicide to cure
themselves of coughs, catarrh, croup,
bronchitis, pneumonia and consumption.

NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â Archbishop Cor
rigan's pastoral letter is filled with praise
of his Holiness Leo XIII. - It will be read
in the churches of the diocese to-morrow.
1 olio wing is the letter In part:
"In his long, difficult and glorious pon
tificate nothing has escaped the wisdom,
energy, zeal of Leo XIIL In every part
of the world he has printed luminous and
enduring traces of his activity. Hardly
was our Holy Father chosen to preside
over the destinies of the universal church
when he inaugurated his reign by declar
ing himself a, Maecenas of art, literature
and science. A fresh impetus was given
at once to the study of the sacred scrip
ture and history. The treasures of the
Vatican library and its archives were
thrown open to the world. Scholastic
philosophy /was restored to its place of
honor and the teachings of wisdom of St.
Thomas were inculcated in all Catholic
seminaries and halls of learning. New
life and spirit pervaded every branch of
knowledge. vvSv
Influence on Family Life.
"From the field of Catholic education,
which was cultivated, fostered and pro
moted in every Quarter of the globe, l^eo
XIII penetrated into the sanctuary of
family life, threatened by the deadly de
mon of divorce. With all the dignity of
an apostle and with the polished periods
of a Cicero, his master mind, in a well
known encyclical, portrayed the beaut}
and holiness of Christian marriase as
well as the dreadful dangers Impending
over individuals and society should time
honored ideals be disfigured or destroyed.
"Again we find him employing all his
energy and the vast moral power of his
office to heal the wounds of civil society.
While specious theories aimed at the over
throw of political and social institutions,
while secret societies burrowed in the
dark against the altar and throne, while
the tide of socialism was rising higher
and higher and threatening to submerse
ancient landmarks and Christian civiliza
tion, he ceased not to impress on trie
hearts of the people a respect and obedi
ence to constituted authority, pleading
eloquently with rulers on the duty of jus
tice and gentleness, recalling to their
minds the sovereign obligation of pro
moting peace, civil order and "happiness,
and urging with as much enlightened wis
dom and sweet reasonableness principles
which alone could insure friendly har
mony and co-operation between capital
and labor. # " " â
Bare Tact and Prudence.
â¢The genius of Leo XIII shone forth
no less strikingly in forming and cement
ing amicable relations with the various
eovernments of Europe. By his tact his
fcpirit of prudent conciliation and his fore
right he so won his way that the Roman
Pontiff, despoiled of his temporal prince
dom and clad only in the royalty of moral
power. waÂ» requested in the nineteenth
century to renew the role of arbitrator
exercised so often by the Vicar of Christ
in the apes of faith.
"It is particularly gratifying to us, rev
erend dear brethren and *belo\'ed chil
dren, that the great Pontiff who has la
bored so zealously for the universal
church has nourished special love and pre T
telection for the faithful of these United
Sistes. Of this we are all witnesses. 'Ah"
exclaimed the venerable Pontiff but a few
weeks ago to Bishop Farley, 'amid my
niany trials America is my consolation.
There the church enjoys liberty. In the
tjiitea States she Is -free to build her
churches and her schools unmolested
Here in Rome I, the Vicar of Christ, am
as & slave deprived of free action. In
Ita.y, in France the church is being per
secuted by those who should defend her
uhank God for the consolation that comes
tons from free America.*
"To so glorious, go zealous and so en
lightened a Pontiff, the whole Catholic
world, as cne heart and one soul will
tenaer its tribute of reverence and af
fection on March 3. the dawn of the
twenty-fifth year of his pontificate. It is
but right and becoming that our own
populous archdiocese, which in numbers
at least leads the way in the missionary
Â¦world, should be second to none ln offer-
Ing to so great and loving a father a
solemn attestation of its unbounded loy
alty and unfeigned love."
Three requests are made of the clergy
end laity of the diocese, as follows: That
all receive holy communion and recite the
rosary on Sunday. March 2. for the in
tentions of the Holy Father; that the holy
sacrifice be offered on March 3, and that
the Bishops assist in a solemn- pontifical
mass followed by the Te Deum in the
cathedral and that all contribute to the
purse to be presented to the Holy Father
which shall include the Peter's pence
collection. â¢
Sloan May Secure a License.
LONDON. Feb. 22.-LÂ«rd Marcus Beres
ford has written to Tod Sloan, the Amer
ican Jockey, who Is in Paris, urging him
to apply for a renewal of his English
license to ride. His lordship Bald to a. rep
resentative of the Associated Press:
"I like Sloan and will do anything I can
to help him. Many sportsmen believe he
has been eufflciently punished. As there
ere none too many good Jockeys avail
able, I hope the stewards will reinstate
him."
In â¢view of Lord Beresford's connection
with the King's stables and the under
standing that William C. Whitney Is de
sirous of seeing Sloan reinstated, It Is
generally expected the jockey's applica
tion will be accepted.
Impressive Services Will Be Held in
the Cathedral in Celebration of
the Anniversary of the
Pontificate. "M

MR. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER JR. delivered an address a few- days ago to the students
of Brown University, in the course of which he discussed the trust question and con*
tributed to it/if hot new information,. at least a new simile' and 'raised it from the
dreary depths of the dismal science of political economy to the,* blooming, tablelands of
poetry. Mr. Rockefeller compared the. trust to the American Beauty rose, which he said "can be
produced in the splendor and fragrance which bring cheer to the beholders only by sacrificing
the early buds which grow up around it." ?mj0 : Â¦ : â¢
The crushing out of the smaller industries* of the country for the purpose of producing a
'huge trust Mr. Rockefeller declared to be equally as wise as the sacrificing of many buds to the
production of a prize-winning rose. By way. of showing that his political economy is not only
poetic but moral, he said: "We might say that a man often succeeds in business by closing up
smaller firms. Oftentimes we cannot reconcile this fact. It seems to, us corxtrary to the golden
rule. Nevertheless, it is true that the corporation forces the weaker rival to go out pi business
with the result, however, that through; economy and the reduced cost of production, when the
principle really works, the decreased consumption price \ becomes a 'great -benefit to all. It is;Â£
therefore, the 'greatest good to the greatest numb)er." :. . -'
,'Thus/it will be seenthat in the Rockefeller code the trust is not only as sweet as the rose
but precious as the golden rule. It happens; however y ;that thegolden rule says nothing- at all about ; .
the greatest good to the i greatest number,: but, on the contrary, implies that the biggest of major
ities have no right to crush the weakest of small numbers./ In that part of: his address, therefore :
Mr. Rockefeller was manifestly weak;. His strength lies in his similes and his poetic-diction,- and
now that man academic" discourse he has given to the Standard Oil Company the title of the>-
American Beauty rose perhaps it .will. smellVswieeterfand be more lovely in ihe eyes of men.

Petersburg before the Czar, in opera, and
he presented me with a gift with his own
hands.
"But I did not have my picture in all
the American papers, therefore," the
singer quaintly said, "no one here knew
anything about it.
"But that is the best way. I am con
vinced, for a girl to study," Nordica re
sumed. "The voice is only her quarry, so
to speak, and it is a far cry from there
to the cathedral. Let her find out among
her own folks whether with a voice she
has musical feeling, a gift for languages,
courage, long patience, industry and
brains above all, and when she. has
proved her possession of these things,
then. If ever, is the time for foreign study,
but always under proper protection."
"How is a student to defend herself
from the charlatan at home?" I asked,
"for he is abroad .in the land here as
elsewhere."
"By her own intelligence," Mme. Nor
dica tersely replied, and it is easy to see
that her ethical doctrine holds a large
element of personal responsibility. "If a
girl finds that her voice thins or muffles,
that the throat Is tired with the work
given to her by her teacher, that the vo
cal apparatus is becoming less and not
more flexible to her desire, surely It ar
gues a lack of brains to continue to
study under such misguided - inspiration.
The trouble is that the student usually
has a blind confidence in her teacher, for
getting that here more than in any other
form of study it is essential that she shall
know for herself exactly what she is
doing. When the good teacher is found,
of course, the confidence cannot .be too
implicit, but even then the intelligent
pupil can help the master to an under
standing of her peculiar needs. This lazi
ness of. intellect is the commonest vice
among students; the next, the desire to
sinr an aria before a scale can be sung
properly. Let a pupil think for herself,
watch herself in every minutest effort
that she makes and be content to build
patiently, ever patiently, the solfeggi be
fore the aria, the foundation .before tho
roof and she cannot go very far wrong.
But, remember, that America Is the best
place for her always, it is the .beat coun
try anywhere." -.; < \ v . :.-. .,â¢

The chief event of the current musical
week will of course be the concerts of
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, to take
place at the Metropolitan Temple on the
evenings of Wednesday, Friday and Sat
urday, art'd Saturday afternoon. It seems
that Mr. Steindorff and the directors of
the San Francisco Symphony Society
have deemed it wiser to postpone the
local symphony concert, whose date fell
on Friday next, to the Friday following,
in view of the embarrassment: of riches
in symphonic fare, and perhaps five sym
phony concerts in four days would have
been rather much of a good thing.
Following an admirable custom that ex
ists in most of the cities where symphony
concerts are regularly established there
will be a special rate given by the Chi
cago Orchestra, management to schools
and colleges where music is taught, and
the prices are popular to Â¦ begin with, be
it said. The programmes are good, a
happy mixture of the purely classical and
best popular numbers, including - among
the. works new here the "1812" overture
of TschaikowEky; -'Carmen Suite," Bizet;
Volkmann 'cello concerto (A minor):
Wagner-WIlhelmJ paraphrase on "Parsi
fal" and an aria from 8. Coleridge Tay
lor's "Hiawatha's Wedding Feast." The
symphonies to be given are Mendels
sohn's "Scotch" Symphony, Tschaikow
sky's "Pathetique" Symphony, Beetho
ven's Seventh. By mphony and the "Ig
nore" Symphony of Raff, the Beethoven
and' Tschalkowsky symphonies having
been heard here but once before.
The orchestra will be assisted by Mnie.
Ragna Linne. the well-known Swedish
soprano; Jan Van Oordt, violinist; Franz
Wagner, 'cellist, and E. C. Towne, tenor.
Adolph Rosenbecker conducts and his
band numbers fifty-five men.
The Emma Nevada concert is dated for
the 3d of March, and will take place at
Metropolitan Temple. Mine. Nevada's
work is too well â¢ known here to need
comment, but she brings with her this
time a company that promises unusually
well. Including Pablo Casals, court 'cellist
to the Queen of Spain; Moreaur a French
pianist and composer of distinction, and
Maquarre, a flautist,, who tor the last two
years has been the soloist of the.Lamou
reux and Colonne orchestras in Paris'*
and Heath Gregory, an American ' singer
of repute. A highly, interesting and ex

this notable concert .organization, alto

GIL BLAS, in his scampish and
delightful youth, set out Â¦ one
day to be an actor. With
quaint simplicity . Le Sage's
lusty' adventurer tells' of ' his
disillusionment among the actor : folk Â¦ he
thought so fine and of the manner of hW
coming to see ..neir imperfections. Says
he: Â¦' . ', :,Â¦Â¦ .;_Â¦Â¦
"I not only adorned my memory with
the finest passages from the dramatic
masterpieces,- but I strove to bring my
taste to perfection, and in order to ac
complish this I listened with a greedy
attention to all that the players said. If
they praised any performance I es
teomed it, and that which met with their
disapprobation was immediately despised
by me. I thought they were/as skillful In
plays as Jewelers are In diamonds. Nev
erheless Pedro de Moya's tragedy had
great Â¦ success, although â¢ they â¢ had prog
nosticated its failure. But even that
could not make me suspect their judg
ment, and I chose rather to believe that
the public wanted* common sense than to
doubt the company's Infallibility. I vras
assured, however, from all quarters that
those new pieces . of which - the players
had not a good opinion were usually very
much applauded, and. that, on the con
trary, those which they received with ap
probation* were | commonly hissed by the
audience. . I was told that it was a maxim,
with them to Judge badly of the works
that were presented to them, and was in
formed of a. thousand instances where
success belied ' their decisions, but all
these proofs were scarcely sufficient to
disabuse me. Â¦ '
"1 shall, never forget one day. In the
first representation' of a new comedy, that
the players had pronounced cold and
tedious, and actually thought they should
not be permitted, to finish performing. In
these sentiments they performed the first
act, which met with great applause and
quite astonished, them. The second act
was played and still better received than
the first, upon which the \ actors were
confounded. 'How the devilV said Rosl
mlro, 'this comedy succeeds!' At last
they acted the third, which gave more
pleasure than the two former. 'I can't
comprehend the meaning of this!' said
Ricardo. 'We; imagined that this piece
would -not please, yet every .one Is
charmed with it!' 'Gentlemen,* said one
ol them then with great naivete, 'the rea
son is there are a thousand strokes ot
wit in the performance which we had not
observed.'" .
Quite of the sense of this . 200-year-old
wisdom Is what. Charles Francis Bryant,
the busy stage ' manager of the Alcazar
Theater, has to say of the average Thes
pian that comes under his ken. I had
wanted to know something of the ma
chinery of the cheaper stock companies,
whereby, week by week, they are enabled
to present plays ' in the very acceptable
fashion In \ which, for example, the Al
cazar presents its never-ending pro
gramme, and went to 'Mr. Bryant seek
ing the knowledge. But that is one of
the oddments of wisdom that the stage
manager picked up during his Alcazar
experiences, and is quite suggestive, it
not- strictly apropos of the mechanics of
stage presentations.
"Yes, if the actors, dislike' their parts
dislike the play.V Mr. Bryant says "Mr*
Belasco and I generally shake hands on
It, for we know we have a success In
sight - And/, contrariwise." '
"But you want td know/ something of
the getting- out of the weekly play 7, Â«
not?" he asked. \ for I had before pre
ferred my request- for information. Then
he added quizzically, "You will tire of the
subject sooner than I, " for ii is a hobby
with me.',' . Â¦ Â¦, -.'Â¦ . , ' f
' "Go ahead," . I reply , gracefully.
One thing , that Is Â¦ a perpetual source of
amusement , to, me," Mr. Bryant be-ins
"is the popular notion of an actor'sWft'
with particular reference - to ' the Â¦ actor
FAMOUS SINGER "WHO WILL
APPEAR IN THIS CITY NEXT
MONTH. .
of the stock . company. One wonders
where the public imagines the time for
the traditional little suppers and'festivi
ties comes in. We put on a new play al
most every week. That means, for one
actor alone, sometimes a matter of a
hundred typewritten pages to learn, not
to speak of all the accompanying 'busi
ness.', We give nine performances every
week, and meanwhile the rehearsals for
the. next play are going on almost every
day. The part*., upon which I frequently
work all night on Monday, are given out
on Tuesday morning: and the players are
expected to be letter perfect m them by
Thursday morning. The rehearsals last
from 10 o'clock to 2, 3 or 4 o'clock, with
an interval for a hurried luncheon, and
then for the women there Is a tiresome
interview with the dressmaker for thft
following week's costumes."- Then, final
ly, all must be back at the theater in
time for the evening's performance. Quite
frequently the gay midnight hour is de
voted to the learning of the lines and
when you come to reckon up there la
very little other time for the work. It
Is no rare thing, also, for the whole of
Sunday night until the dawning of Mon
day, to be devoted to the rehearsal of
some of the more important plays, and
as there Is a rehearsal and two perform
ances on Sunday, you will understand
why there Is no actors* rehearsal on Mon
day morning."
"He does seem to be kept buÂ«y," I
agree, "and what of your part in It?"
"A stage manager in his time plays
many parts." plagiarizes Mr. Bryant. "I
cast the plays, of course; choose them
sometimes; settle their order of .appear
ance; rehearsÂ© the players,. and In most
cases have to originate three-fourths of
the 'business.' Then there is scenery to
look after, and properties, and these,
when there Is not unlimited capital to go
at. mean work and plenty of it. For ex
ample, if a Gobelin tapestry room Is in
question, it is either to adapt the ever
useful'burlap or to explore the Mission
street historical furniture stores for a
substitute. Sometimes our property loft
will supply our need, with the assistance
of the busy paint pot, but there are times
when it gives out, and then Mission, street
comes in. It is quite like having to furn
ish a house once a week, besides building
the house, and in every style from Queen
Anne to Louis Qulnze. The furniture and
scenery rehearse on, Monday morning by
the way, when our electrician, stage car
penter and scene painter taka a hand.
We have a very original and clever scenic
artist, quite a young fellow, by. the way.
But the stock company is a very good
school for the actor, though it Is such
hard work." concluded Mr. - Bryant, "if
only the actor were ever built to be hap-
Ey in doing that which he finds to his
*? d to do. I saw Ernest Hastings in
Chicago lately in 'Lovers' Lane/ in which
he has made quite a success, and he said
he wished he were baa* In stock again,
for it was unspeakably tiresome playing
one part for so many months. And bo It
goes. But I do not think that you will
find many harder working folk than the
actor crowd."
STAGS MANAGER OF THE ALCA
ZAR THEATER. WHO HAS A FEW
TROUBLES OF HIS OWN.
IT has been my ill-fortune, up to the
present writing, not to have been
.able to hear lime. Nordica sing this
week. But I have had the other
pleasure of hearing our greatest
American elnger talk about her art and
I'm sure I do not know which I prefer.
Mm'e. Nordica talks as well as she sings,
with the same brilliant intelligence and
distinction, and has that to say in almost
every sentence that is of the ' first im
portance to the student of singing.
I found the singer in a very becoming
lounging robe, taking things easily after
her Wednesday night concert, not In her
famous private traveling car. but for
quietness sake at the Palace Hotel. She
was trying to rest away some of the
effects of her recent accident and had
to sing in the evening in Oakland, so I
determined to be brief in my questionings
and modest in my infringement on the
quiet the tired artist so evidently needed.
But. unfortunately for my good inten
tions and Xordlca's peace, the talk drifted
to a subject than which none is nearer
to the heart of the singrerâ the American
girl student abroadâ and soon the famous
Brunnhilde was flinging off the comfort
ers that covered her and throwing back
the loose silken sleeves from her strong
white arms, as if she would gather to
her Valkyr breast every poor little exile
from America, ay, and do royal battle
with a hundred Wotans for her sake.
Naturally, also, I forgot the time, as
Nordica, her eyes flashing with a gener
ous sorrow and indignation, condemned in
wholesale terms the practice of Bending
away the young American girl, alone, to
study In Europe.
"To begin with," she said, "it is wholly
unnecessary, as well as being almost al
ways a heart-breaking experience. The
girl can get everything here In America
that she can get in Europe, without leav
ing the shelter of her own home, among
her own kind and with her own friends.
It is a dangerous and cruel experiment to
throw the inexperienced girl into a so
ciety -where she Is regarded as the legiti
mate prey of every charlatan with a
solemn shingle at his door and a lively
itch for the American dollar In his hand.
And worse. It Is almost Impossible for
the European Intellect to take In the fact
that these are nice, good girls, from out
best homes, that American parents are
sending over In their unprotected thou*
sands to the Old ."World art centers. The
European parent would not dream or
sending bis daughter here under such con
ditions, and he is right, and the American
girl abroad suffers in his estimation ex
actly in proportion to his ignorance ol
our customsâ which Is commonlv of the
phenomenal kind. She is In constant dan
ger of being misunderstood and taken for
that which she is not, and It cannot but
be eo In a society In which the good young
girl, unattended, is almost unknown."
"And it is all eo unnecessary," repeated
Mine. Norflica. "You can get everything
here. To be personal, I studied in Boston.
X lived with my parents and began to
learn how to sing when. I was 14, though
I bad sung all my life, of course. After
three years' steady work I tried my wings
In a little church positionâ the natural
thing*. Then came, at 17, a' chance to
sing with the Handel and Haydn So
ciety, when I sang for the first time my
'Messiah.' Gllmore of the famous Eng
lish band then gave me the opportunity
to elng in Europe, and at 19 I sang in St.
PERNICIOUS PARASITES.
EVERY man with a profession should either follow and practice it, or cease, assuming its
character to give him force and standing ; in interference in affair^ outside. Â»
, When a .lawyer abandons ihe practice of ; that profession, and, without visible
! means of support, intrudes upon the life, the affnirs and the. business of others, justir
fying. his "position by continually declaring; "I am; a lawyer. I am under the oath and obligation
of an officer of the courts judicial, and as such I am here iir pursuance of my duty to tell you
'thus saith the law,' ''he is not entitled to credence nor to the position claimed by virtue of pro
fessional character/ 7 iHe becomes a pernicious parasite upon the community, leading it astray by
counsel that professes to originate; in his sense of professional /responsibility and his knowledge of
the law. In times of popular upheaval , and feeling,, when the power of the majority is appealed
to by such men and its use is invoked for the abridgment of. rights inherent, great harm/" may
come, and has come, by ; thejnislea'ding appeals which; rest upon the false ftatement that thejlaw
warrants, permits and .grants an abuse of :. power. /Under such leadership the^ view of right and
wrong becomes distorted and men are.moyed byxourage to do things from which, they would
shrink if left. to" their own instincts and to the promptings of conscience. . \
/So, when a cleric, who makes no '..outward and visible sign beyond his frock that he is-or- !
dained, and: who has.no pulpit rior parish, nor visible means of. support; in his profession nor out
side of.it, maintains an attitude qf adviser of 'the people from/the standpoint \>f his sacred call
ing which he does not follow,. themorals of his followers become strabismatic, and an ordained
ranter fakes on the character of a parasjte. 4 , . .-'â¢'1 '
. Especially is harm sure to .follow when such a, man in every discussion abandons the
language of philosophy and the method fitted to a spiritual adviser, and .habitually expresses
himself coarsely, and often. in terms so vulgar that they would not be listened to if used by a lay
man. When such conduct in such a man becomes common, when , misrepresentation', exaggera
tion and falsehood are used with. a recklessness which a self-respecting layman would avoid. The
onlooking people come to associate their use with the clerical character in which the offender
masquerades, and the communion to which he avows allegiance suffers, and the Whole clerical
character in that, and in all religious associations/comes to be degraded in public esteem to* the,
ditch in which he delights to wallow. ; . , - /Â¦' ' v 'Â¦ .
Harshness and. misjudgment, the assignment of a wrong motive, for a right action, 1 .. the
habit of evil speaking, the bearing of false witness against a neighbor, are not within the proper
equipment of any man who persistently claims the position and holds the attitude of/a spiritual
counselor and leader. When they come to be his permanent weaponry and. are displayed on all
occasions and their use is resorted to in the discussion of every- subject; such a man becomes a
pernicious, parasite, harmful to the community, a promoter of disorder and an eheniy of. his com
munion. By all except such as follow him blindly, deceived by his frock, he is recognized as. a
politician of the baser sort, of the brawling, coarse-minded and low variety, who sees in
not its virtue and philosophy, nor its relation to civics, but its seamy side/its opportunities for
All tnougiittul laymen accept gladly the appearance, of a cleric in public activities, Â¦ if he

matism .and is the universal . atmosphere of religion, as necessary, to man's Tightness of life as
the air which it resembles jn its all. enveloping office, his presence is welcome. In such character
he comes to allay passion, not to promote it ; ..,;. to speak not as the' whirlwind and the tempest
which had not the divine spirit, but as the still, small voice which touches the .heart to .a nobler
charity, to a greater /tolerance, and to that love which goes, in sympathy to the neighbor and the
stranger. Such a clerical 'character reflects a kindly light u^on the communion it represents and

But when they find in him ungovernable passion, vulgar speech, brutal swagger, and the habit of

and the safeguards of society lose their force. . ' _ . .
Long tolerance of such a man finally destroys the sense of .right.and wrong in his followers
and undermines human society as far as his influence extends. Such a condition came to.be of
old when the true prophet* cried out : "The "prophets have prophesied falsely, the priests bear rule
thereby, and the people love to have it so." 'Of such parasites it was said of /'old: \"And they bend

It seems so simple for , any one to risk

Precious Specific for the cure of Grip and
C^lds. The best results are obtained by
keeping "77" handy (it fits the vest
pocket), and taking a dose at the first

Isis Sails for Tacoma.
The German steamship Isis sailed yes
terday for Tacoma, where she will finish
discharging her cargo. '
The steam schooner Fulton came into
port yesterday from Astoria. She had
been 103 hours making the trip. She was
bound for San Pedro, but had to put in
here to replenish her coal supply.
Dropped In for More Coal.
The steamship Edith, after more than a
month in the hands of engineers and me
chanios, sailed yesterday for Seattle. She
has been built up into a fine-looking craft.
Her interior arrangements have been re
modeled, and . both officers' and men's
quarters are now as comfortable as up-to
date conveniences can make them. A
water ballast tank has been constructed
and will add greatly to the vessel's sea
worthiness when she is light.
Edith Once More in Commission.
The United States navy hospital steam
ship Solace will be here in a few days.
She was in Honolulu . when the Peru
sailed. She has on board a number of of
ficers bound home on leave and some
civilian passengers. She also brings a
number of sick marines. When docking
at the Pacific Mail dock at Honolulu tha
Solace ran into the wharf and tore away
a big chunk of the Mail Company's prop
erty. She was to have left Honolulu last
Monday.
Solace Will Soon Be Here.
The German ship Agnes arrived yester
day from Honolulu, which port she left
February 4. She has been outside the
heads for three days unable to get into
port on account of southeasterly gales.
She encountered an exceptionally heavy
gale February 15. Squalls were frequent
and fierce. She rolled so heavily that
with one 4urch she carried away the rack
of the main upper topsail yard. The yard
dropped to the slings and from there to
the deck, where it made a formidable im
print. The main and lower upper topsails
were also blown away, f
Agnes Beset by Many Gales.
Ships of every nationality along the wa
ter front and in the harbor were decorated
with bunting yesterday in honor of "Wash
ington's birthday. The Government vessels
in the bay were bright with fluttering
flags and the transport dock added a big
share to the color scheme of the celebra
tion, but the German steamship Luxor
made as brave a showing as any Yankee
In the port, and ships hailing, from
France, Italy and Great Britain all gave
their bunting an "airing. The Nippon
Maru, at the Pacific Mail dock, went all
the other ships just one better by having
a string of flags floating from the end of
her bowsprit. The revenue cutter McCul
loch, lying at Sausalito. was as gay as
any of them, and at noon enveloped her
self in a cloud of gunpowder smoke as her
guns snorted, forth the national salute. .

THE steamship Peru arrived in
port yesterday from the Orient.
She entered the heads one year,
almost to the hour/after the Rio
' de Janeiro disaster. ' She did not
bring many passengers, trans-Pacific
travel being light at this time of the year.
The steamship had a cargo, however,
which included 1131 bales of raw silk and
$20,000 in gold specie. When the Peru
left Honolulu the people in the island city
were worrying^ about the non-arrival of
the steamships China and Sierra, both of
which were delayed at this end. the Si
erra having to await British mails. Spec
ulation was rife as to the reason for the
delay, and when the Peru sailed hope was
gaining ground in Honolulu that the big
liners were playing towboat to the miss
ing: Condor. - ' " - ''\ii.'li
The Peru encountered pleasant weather
most of the way across the Pacific, me
Peru will not go to China, on her next
trip. She has been selected to inaugurate
the new direct service to Manila, and will
clear for that port. She will go on the
drydock before sailing, i

The New Remedy for Catarrh
Is Very Valuable.
A Grand Rapids gentleman â¢who represents
a prominent manufacturing concern and trav-
els through Central . and Southern Michigan
relates the following regarding the new ca-
tarrh cure. He nays :
"After suffering â¢ from catarrh of the head,
throat and stomach for several yeara, I heard
of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets quite accidentally
and like everything else I immediately bought
a package and was decidedly surprised at Â¦ the
Immediate relief it afforded me and still more
to find a complete cure after several weeks'
use. , *
"I have a little son who sings In a boys'
choir in cue of our prominent churches. â¢ and â¢
he , is greatly . troubled ;Â¦ with hoarseness and
throat weakness, and on my return home from
a trip' I gave him a few, of the tablets one
Sunday morning .when ' he > had ; complained of
hoarseness. He i was delighted with their ef-
fect, Â¦ removing all husklness â¢ in a â¢ few 1 minutes
and making the voice clear and strong. ,
Â¦ "As the tablets are very pleasant to â¢ tha
taste, I had no difficulty in persuading him to
use them regularly.
. "Our- family : physician told us they were
an antiseptic preparation of undoubted merit
and that he himself had no hesitation- in usine
and > recommending " Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
for any form of catarrh. 1 /
i; "I have since, met many publio speakers and
profeseional.Bingers who used them constantly
A prominent Detroit lawyer told me that Stu^
art's : Catarrh -Tablets kept his throat * in fine
shape during the - most trying '. weather, and
that he: had; long since -discarded the use of
cheap 1 lozenges and < troches : on the advice ' of
his Â¦ physician that they . contained : so much
tolu, potash and opium as to render their use
a danger to health." '."- -

' Chained to the invalid's chair or hobbling about on crutches, and continually tormented
with pain, the patient in desperation resorts to the use of opiates, which deaden the pain but
leadto ruinous habits. There. is no disease so aggressive and stubborn as Rheumatism
after it weil intrenched or fixed in the system, and no liniment or other external
-â¢application can check it or do any permanent good. Rheumatism is not due to outside
influences or causes, but is a constitutional disease, an internal inflammation produced by a
too acid condition of the blood. Waste matter that should have been cast out of the body is

* This Demon of Pain attacks the old and young, the strong and the weakâ no one is exempt,
"but from middle life to old age is the time when its assaults become most frequent and severe.
At this period the vital energies begin to wane, the blood grows weak and thin, and is easily
â¢ chilled, the circulation becomes uncertain and slow and there is scarcely a moment's
freedom from pain in some part of the body: V ., j
The treatment of Rheumatism must be internal; some remedy that can reach, and
neutralize the poisonous acids and cleanse the circulation. S. S. S., a purely vegetable
medicine, acts promptly and surely in all Rheumatic cases, purifying and invigorating the

failing organs, improves the appetite and digestion, and
builds up the general health, thus fortifying the' system against the tortures of Rheumatism.
Alkalies, Potash and mineral remedies have an opposite effect, destroying the delicate lining

The law In question was passed in the
days of the monarchy, and allowed issu
ance of retail licenses at the rate of |25)
to saloons that should sell no liquors ex
cept the product of- a brewery in Hono
lulu. The regular retail license is $1000 a
year, and it is only by paying this license
that any dealer can retail beers made in
the United States in Hawaii. Estee. held
that this was an unconstitutional discrim
ination against. the mainland breweries. '
HONOLULU, Feb. 22.â United States Dis
trict Judge 'Estee has rendered a decision
declaring 1 unconstitutional a Hawaiian
law : under. which twenty-flve licenses for
saloons which sell only Honolulu-made
beer have been issued and are now in
operation. . : The decision was rendered in
a suit brought by the local agents of a

in Hawaii have materially decreased since

Mining In Siskiyou has made a substantial
advance during the yÂ£ar 1801,' . the established
districts and their gold yields have proven that
the mines In our county, are. permanent, and
with the new prospects found and the develop
ing of the older ones that - a combination of
the increase of gold output can and ".will be
looked forward to during the coming year.
Districts as well known but from which l&ss
was â¢ expected have made even greater ad
vances. Development Â¦ has been backward by
reason of the belief that gold values were en
tirely In shallow placers which were largely
worked out. An Increase of placer gold during
the past year shows that this belief is not well
founded. One notable feature Is development
of quartz ledges throughout our county.
'. Gold mlnlnar was . considerably extended dur
ing the past year, not so much by 'entirely new
discoveries as by the opening and development
of old ones assumed -to be valueless. Perhaps
only a single mine In some , of i our ' districts
has Droved to be permanent, but Â¦ that one Is
proof of more not yet discovered and developed.
Our districts that have permanent mines now
working can be safely, depended upon as con
taining more yet undiscovered and be counted
on to make a much greater showing in values
during 1902. . . Â¦' ;,- -

Eastern and European papers are print

on this coast that are known to be sail
ing under false pretenses. This is a mat
ter of common knowledge. The discovery
that frauds exist and the inability of the
Eastern people to discriminate, owing to
distance from . the coast, has led to a
constant bombardment of the State Min
eralogist's otlice with queries ; about Â¦ the
value of stocks, etc. This has brought
about the move that concerns all honest
miners and is calculated to be a source of
great discomfort to fakers; Mr. Aubury
says he will follow up the investigations

The locality of these placers- is among the
oldest known ''â¢ portions' of 'Arizona. Forty
years [ ago the Colorado River was the main
gateway of the territory. Freight entered by
that route for, many years,- and mills are still
standing that â¢Â¦ were landed at Aubrey on that
river. The value of these placers was i known
to the miners who In early days passed "over
all the region contiguous to . the Colorado, but
the almost total absence of water in the moun
tains compelled the miners to Â¦Â¦ pack their rich
dirt to the river, or ' to ; distant natural tanks
to be washed. Oro : Flno ; was the most . cele
brated camp of that time. There the sott
shale bedrock rises ' to ; the â¢ surface, and Â¦ when
the art of dry washing ' was learned, this rich
bedrock was the scene: of active â¢ work, and
much of it has been washed and re washed a
score of times.

- At this point is also' situated a . machine
shop, blacksmith shop and sawmill, where all
necessary work is quickly Â¦ turned out for this
mine. The mill has CO stamps f and 24 Frue
vanners. The concentrates from this mill are
carried by a wire -rope tramway to the chlor
ination plant, 1500 feet distant, at a cost of 5
cents per ton, estimating power at $5 per
horsepower per month. The hoist, tramway
and- sawmill are run by waterpower, while
the mill, machine shop and the blowers for the
blacksmith shop "*are run by - electric power.
The hoisU mill and all the works are lighted
by electricity, but no electricity is used un

electric lamrs.
Underground the work Is sd vast that one
cannot realize how many tons of ore have
been excavated. For every ton taken out t*ie
space thereby created is at once filled with
country rock taken from crosscuts run into
the foot wall or hanging: wall, in addition to

presented himself to the financial secre

and reimburse It for all that it had ex
pended in his behalf. A footing up showed
that the amount was $658. The son of
fered to give a check for the amount
then and there, but the lodge decided to
wait and take the money when the bene

add dyspepsia, shown by. sour, watery risings,

stomach, causing heart , trouble and Â¦ difficult
breathing, as well as for all other forms of
stomach trouble, the safest treatment is to
take one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
after each. meal. I advise them because they
contain- no harmful drugs, but. are composed
of valuable digestives,- which act promptly upon
the food eaten. I never knew; a. case of indi-

It gives me much pleasure to recommend' to
the public Mr. Oeorge Mayerle of 1071 Market
street, San Francisco, strictly as a skillful and'
expert optician. My sight began to fall in
1877, twenty-five years ago, and since that
time I have been wearing glasses. I consulted
a prominent optician In Chicago, Dr. Holmes*
At different times since that I have had lenses
fitted on In St. Louis, Cleveland. O.. and also
tried the FUth-avenue opticians in Pitteburg,
who claim to be amonj the best In their line
in the country. ' I do not hesitate to say, that
I have met with better and more satisfactory
results with Mr. Mayerle than with I any ' of
the above named," who have much higher pre-
tensions. - Respectfully, V .

it be read, whereupon Charles GUdea pro
tested on the ground that as the confer
once was not yet organized It could- not
transact business. Joseph Rothschild
urged that the resolution be read and a
motion to that effect precipitated a warm
iii>cusfion. in -which John Barnett
ci^&rged that Raabe was not a delegate
to the conference. Motion followed mo
rion with bewildering promiscuity until at
Vngth it was decided to postpone action
until after the conference was permanent

Â«-Â«i by. the sachem as follows: A. A.

D. Ltmon. A recess of five minutes was
then taken to allowthe committee to pre
rare Its reoort. and at the expiration of
that time the committee reported that
tvrenty-seven clubs were represented. It
was shown that Raabe was supplied with

THE State League of Iroquois
Clubs held a lively conference
in Pythian Castle yesterday.
The meeting was called for the
purpose of organizing the Dem
ocracy of the State for Effective
work during: the coming cam
paign. The number of clubs represented
v. as twenty-seven, and the rollcall showed
that over one hundred delegates were in
attendance. '
The meeting had scarcely been called
to order by Grand Sachem Charles H.

County, was the Â¦ next', speaker, v He said
he became a Democrat years ago, when
he heard the slogan of Allen G.Thurman
that a tax sufficient only 'to meet the ex
penses of government was the keynote of
the Democratic' party. The [Republican
party, -he went "on; was. 'the father â¢' of
trusts;" and no one who loved his country
and fellow-men - could conscientiously,
DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES.
Gorman insisted that no good results
could be accomplished unless the various
counties were given representation on the
committee. A prolonged discussion fol
lowed with the result that the committee
on organization accepted Gorman's sug-
Kestlon against Ruddock's protest. An
amendment was offered by Kildea that
not less than five vice sachems from each
county be appointed .to the committee,
and when this waa . presented Ruddock
amended with fine sarcasm that the num
ber be not less than one from each coun
ty. The chair declared this as meaning
one or more, and on this Solomon-like in
terpretation the amendment ; was carried
It having been announced by the com
mittee oh resolutions that It -was not yet
ready to file its report, the delegates were
treated to Democratic oratory. Lafe Pence
was the first speaker. He spoke of the
methods employed by; Democratic- party
managers In Indiana: The secret of suc
cess of the party In- that " State was
thorough organization. . To say that there
.is no Democratic organization, - in- San
Francisco was erroneous.- Notwithstand
ing conditions which rendered the- defeat
of Tobin for Mayor- Inevitable, a t majority
of the Board of Supervisors, a City At
torney and District Attorney were re
elected by Democratic votes. ,
"That the people of San Francisco are
satisfied with the result which has thrust
upon them a Mayor, who :1s the puppet
of Abe Ruef," the speaker said, was not
evident. If the election were held over
again. . insisted the speaker, Tobin would
be elected .hands down. Pence claimed
amid applause, that this would be a Dem
ocratic year in California, and ventured
the prediction that the entire State ticket
of that party would be elected. -
After recess the committee on organiza
tion reported in favor of appointing a
general. committee of not more than live
vice sachems from each assembly district
for the purpose of formulating plans for
an effective State campaign.
Joseph Gorman stated that some of the
Assembly Districts have more than one
ccunty, and he suggested that each coun
ty be allowed live members.
John C. Ruddock, protested against- this
plan. What he wanted was more commit
teemen. He did not believe it proper. to
fix the maximum at five members from
each Assembly District, but desired to
see that number specified as the mini
mum.

against the absorption of the wealth Of
the nation, by corporations and Individ

to the immediate necessity of amending
the constitution so as to prevent the evils
resulting to the industrial life of the na

to celebrate Washington's birthday and
the battle of Buena Vista. Hundreds of
passersby peered through the windows of.
the restaurant and were impressed by the
appearance of the defenders of the flag,
dray hairs covered the head of every
guest and age had stamped its mark oh
all their countenances. Not more than
twenty veterans were able to be present
but those who attended enjoyed a delight
ful evening. Incidents of camp-life, sto
ries and anecdotes of Taylor and oth<?r
famous Americans were told with new in
terest; the campaigns that led to victo
ries for this country were recounted by
the men who were there, and the events
in which they figured, although they hap
penea three-score years ago, were stlU
fresh Jn their memories.
W. c. Burnett, president of the asso
ciation, was toastmaster. He Introduced
each speaker in clever fashion and kept
the flow of talk from waning by recalling
some incident and inviting a comrade to
tell what he remembered of the occur
rence. Colonel Andrews sang "Morlar
ity, a song familiar to the veterans.
Secretary William L. Duncan delivered
some interesting addresses. Treasurer
Sydney J. Loupe spoke in defense of the
Soldiers at Yountvllle and refuted
the slanders made against It by scandal
mon 1 ? e "-"-.He-saId' it was the grandest
institution^ of Its kind in the country,
and he said he felt honored to be a mem
ber of its governing board. He called
upon a veteran present who 13 an Inmate
of the home to corroborate his state
ments, and he did so In no uncertain
terms. President Burnette was crowned
with a sprig of smilax by Comrade An
drews and the festive gathering adjourned
by singing "Auld Lang Syne."
i Among those seated at the banquet
board were: Comrades Burnett. Duncan.
Loupe. Kurbaum, Thlstleton. Shaupp. Ba
ker, Kellogg, Koster, Clary. Murphy, Ban

Rugh and Andrews. The association has
400 members, but as the years go by the
number is gradually dwindling. Gather
ings of this kind have a tendency to bring
the old soldiers together and are always
enjoyed by. the men who figured in the
historic battles of Buena Vista, Santa

Called Washington a Pharisee.
When they placed themselves In hostility to
the mother country, the command of the army
was given to George Washington. For eight
long years without pay. he devoted his time
and skill for the interests of his country and
for liberty. Â¦> He met with many disappoint
ments, he suffered more Â¦ defeats than he se
cured victories, yet with all â¢ he was deter

his country, but he also had. to contend with

of Tom Paine, the; author of "The, Age. of

and had asked Washington to secure his re

to do eo. When Paine was set at liberty he

The speaker reverted briefly to the home
life of Washington, which he regarded as
a model v for all; Americans,; and com
plained of the scant consideration Â¦ given
to the' Influence exerted on the early his
tory, of : our country by Martha.Washing
ton. \ .
On occasions like the present, he said. It
was proper, to try to draw a lesson from
the careers of . the : great men who Â¦ were
commemorated. In this instance the les
son was 'Â¦ evident. If Washington were
alive to-day, he said, it would be his aim
to preserve the "American Â¦ republic from
an industrial serfdom, aa it had been his
achievement to save it- from political
servitude. His would be the first voice to
be raised in protest against' the invasion
of Â» these shores by; hordes of .Chinese la
borers ; to compete with the workmen of
America- To, ; all their pleas, 'he .said,
Washington eould only have answered, -."I
have seen- to what. condition . you have
brought, your ' own > country and . I . do not
want you so to debase mine." - .
{Washington's \ Home Life.
He dwelt on the inferiority in equipment
and . training under which the soldiers of
Washington suffered, as. compared with
the well drilled and equipped- soldiery of
the English forces." No less discouraging,
he said were the plaints and calumnies
of Washington's own countrymen, : who
stayed at home to revile the liberator and
embarrass . him while he and his gallant

the address delivered by Franfe-R. Mar
getts "on George Washington. Owing to
the; lateness of the hour when the exer
cises .were begun < the speaker felt con
strained to omit a" large portion of the
speech as prepared .by him, . and it was" a
matter "of -regret to .â¢ the . entire audience
that he chose this course. From the se
lections that were delivered it was patent
that he had made a close and Intelligent
study, of the career and character of the
greatest of patriots, and was prepared to
give a masterly study of his subject Jn
eloquent and impressive terms. .
God,', he said, had endowed the territory
under the dominion of the United States
with all the natural riches enjoyed by
the rest of the world, and as a crowning
gift had decreed that these blessings
should be enjoyed by a free and intelli
gent people. That this, might be so it
was necessary that there be a revolution.
Before the foundation of the Western re
public the riches, of the earth had been
the spoils of the aristocracy of other
lands. -It was In the scheme ot things, he
said, that the mass of the people should
enjoy them in this country. In Its result,
he said, the American revolution was the
greatest movement in the history of hu
man liberty.

. The Greatest and best argument ' was made
by Washington when he : Â»ald, "If we would
avoid insult and gain and retain the. respect of

the army which' cives the power to the other
departments of . state: without.; it ,no govern

cornerstones â the church, town meetings, . mili

have been upheld,'- but if has , been sadly
neglected. The last resort upon which agna

from competition in commerce and we must be
able " to - protect these interests wherever j we
may have them.. Protection lies in - the war
power of your country. : . . " v-
Rear- Admiral Terry responded to' a
toast to "The Navy." ' He said: â¢
,Up to 1880 the United States had practically
no navy and no means for fashioning armor
or ships, i but to-day she can turn > out , a ship
that . cannot be excelled by any nation under

The affair was brought to a close by, the
singing ' of VAmorlca.",
It is a joyous thing to talk before such a
body of men, especaiily when one , belongs to a
co-education university. ; Of, all the nations
under the gun none had more reason' to be
thankful to God for the guiding hand than the
"United States. We are now standing in the
precepts of George Washington. Our greatest
teacher I believe was , Ralph Waldo Emerson.
He said: "I believe in a nation of . individuals
and in a nation that believes in moral law."
Webster said: "This 'la-, not' an. age in which
to fight for political honors, but an age in
which to fight for thÂ» recognition of political
duties."
I come from a country in which the chief
qualification of the citizen is to bÂ« "agin" the
Government" In speaking to the late Joseph
Le Conte I once asked him how he was yet so
old and had still preserved himself so well,
and he answered me by saying, "I took great
care in choosing my parents." This is just
what we did In choosing the fathers of our
country. It was the Scotch-Irish, the English
and the American fathers that made tho Sons
of the Revolution a possibility. ! It was thÂ«y
who. left the plow in the furrow, left the ham
mer on the anvil.' and shouldering the musket,
fought, bled and died that their liberty might
be saved. It was our fathers who made tn -â¢
country what it is. Let us look with a high
standard at the possibilities which our fathers
have placed within our grasp, 1
"Our Teachers" was then given by
Charles Gayley. He said:
The world j has never failed to : proJute a
successor, eo President Roosevelt came. He
has the con^dence oÂ£ every true American and
will do his duty" nobly. . -
Rev. Dr. F. W.- Clampett \then spoke on
"Our Fathers." He said:

drunk to "Our youngest Presidentâ
Koosevelt," Horace G. Piatt spoke .on
'â¢The Presidents of the Unued States,"

TACOMA, Feb. 22.â Advices from Daw

dealer has obtained a "corner" on the
oats supply of the upper Yukon. He has
the power to fix the price at his own
figure. Ten days ago this man advanced
cats to 9 cents a pound, or {ISO a ton.
This is an enormous price, considering the
great 6tock he has on hand and the fact
that the number of horses owned in Daw
son and vicinity is much larger than ever
before. Several horses are now kept busy
during the winter season in logging ope
rations and the hauling of supplies for

Late last night the street railway com
pany operating all the lines was compelled
to abandon Its service, and at midnight
the efforts of the officials were devoted
entirely to getting the cars then on the
streets back to the car sheds. . By this
morning, however, they had succeeded in
clearing the wires sufficiently to permit
the running of a few cars on each line
Hundreds of men are. at work cleaning
the wires, and until they are convinced
that all danger from contact with electric
light wires is past the officials of the va
rious telegraph companies will not at
tempt to operate their wires.
Mail advices from Philadelphia say that
city is as completely shut off. from electric
communication with the outside world aa
though 'such a thing as a telegraph or
telephone wire never existed. The storm
is. the most disastrous one, as far as wire3
are concerned, that has ever visited that
section.' Within. the city limits scarcely a
single overhead wire Is In working order.
Poles. are down and wires are -dangling
from housetops on nearly every street.
On Front street, which skirta the Dela
ware River, thirty big poles on one line
were broken off and are lying in the
street. This Is but one route. There are
dozens of routes leading Into the city, and
almost all of them. are as badly crippled
It is stated that on the Pennsylvania
Railroad between Philadelphia and New
Brunswick more than 150 poles are down.
Officials of the telegraph companies say
It will be fully a week before all of the
routes. are even in fair working condition.
The damage to wires apparently is
much worse than was inflicted by the
memorable blizzard of 1888, although the
storm does not cover nearly so much ter
ritory. Four persons were killed in Phil
adelphia during yesterday and last night
bv â¢ coming "in contact with heavily
charged wires. At least twenty-five
horses , were killed during the day by
broken wires. ' Â¦ Â» â¢ .
-The greatest damage was sustained in
Brooklyn, where scores of horses were
killed by contact with live wires, which
were everywhere prostrated. ,In Prospect
Park and in many,, of the avenues hun
dreds of trees were denuded of ice-laden
branches. Brooklyn bridge presented a
brilliant spectacle, being completely en
cased in a glittering : crystal coating. On
Sfaten. Island hardly a wire was left
standing, and traffic was everywhere sus
pended. ' .**
' NEW YORK, Feb. 22.â The sleet' storm
that struck New York proved to be the
most severe that has been experienced for
several years. Telegraphic communica
tion was almost completely, suspended un
tifHhis evening, when it was'generally re
stored. Throughout , the' day the streets
were rendered nearly impassable by slush,
many of them almost presenting the ap
pearance of rivers, the sewers being in
capable of carrying off the â¢ overflow.
Owing to the holiday street car traffic
was 'at a minimum; ."
1 he trial occupied but two;and a half
days, a greater, part of which time was
given up to securing a jury. The defense
offered no. evidence beyond that of Wood
ward himself, who yesterday, made a con
fession." In which" he told of breaking jail
with three companions, the pursuit and
battle with the Sheriff and posse. He,
said, . however, that the killing was not
intentional; that the shot^were fired for
the purpose of holding th^Bheriff and his
men off until he could make his escape:
Woodward was chased to a ranch. near
Billings, Mont., where he was captured
ofter a desperate flght with , the officers.
Since bis return to Casper a large number
of : men has been ready to . lynch Wood

ties ready for action in the event of their
services being required. All is now quiet

Stanislaus County has forwarded to 'the
State Board of Trade in this city a collec
tion of â¢ exhibits illustrative of the re
sources of the county to be displayed per
manently at Â¦ the j rooms - of the board in
the ferry building. Supervisor Collins of
Santa Cruz County was yesterday in. con
ference with Secretary Fllcher concern
ing the Santa Cruz exhibit. A communi
cation was also received by Secretary
Fllcher from the Oroville Board of Trade,
which Is arranging: to have all the pro
ducts of .Butte < County on exhibition.
Santa Cruz County will' have alarge sup
ply of literature printed for distribution
by the State Board of Trade to the excur
sionists who will arrive here, during the
coming season; on - colonists' . rates,- and
also to the delegates to the several'con
ventions. â¢
in the cause; you Know, as I know, that they
fall to touch the root of ths evil. Will we have
legislation?. Will we have laws enacted? Will
Â¦we .see-- to"- it that they ba rigidly ensorced?
We have all that now, and you know as I
know that -legislation,, law and tventhe veneer
of public opinion do not reach" down to the
mainspring of the awful crimes against the
angelic virtue. , : . .' .
There Is But One Homsdy.
Expediency is their keynote, and expediency
will never uproot a deep seated and .thriving
evil.. There is but one remedy, there is but
one cure. . there is tut one way of reaching
the source of this evil, and that is through tlu
conscience of each Individual. Conscience puri
fied, chastened, elevated by supernatural reli
gious principles and help is our only safeguard;
it can do all things. "I can do all things in
him who strenstheneth me"; without that aid,
without religious principles, without grace, our
conscience is at the mercy of passion, and' we
are helpless, for- "without me ye can do noth
ing
I, will not Bpeak of the mighty uplifting work
which woman can-do In this regard, I will no:
speak of her great natural powers, doubly
powerful when supernaturallzed, nor will I
6peak of her share In. the evil, for she, too,
may have given "for naught her priceless gilt."
Man Contributes to \ Wrong.
. It is man's contribution to the crying wrong
that concerns us: He is neither clear nor
blameless. : He has much shame to bear- and
much guilt "to atcne for. - And while I feel
assured that you are not stained I cannot but
ask you to renew your endeavors : to live up
to the lofty ideals of the institute and to work
untiringly for the crushing out of this mon
strous evil for. your God's and your country's
sake. To redress the crying social wrong, to
raise womanhocd from degradation and shame,
to hold up to reverence the ideal of . a . pure,
chivalrous, manly manhood, this Is the crusade
in which you are invited, nay, exhorted,,, to
enlist. Will you as members of the Institute,
as soldiers of Christ, as a chosen body, claim
your part In the glory of. this campaign? .If
so, the work must begin now; It must begin,
as I have said, in yourselves, in . your own
conscience. Thfre can be no success against
the foe unless where Is disaffection and mu
tiny In the citadel. The holiest and noblest
thing In man Is conscience. It makes him.dif
ferent from all other lower beings, awakens In
him a spirit of the divine life, makes him
truly a child of* heaven walking en earth.
â¢God's Most Precious Gift.
"Conscience is God's most precious gift to
man. "Our glory,'.' writes the apostle of the
Gentiles, "is this the testimony of our con
science that in simplicity of- heart and sin
cerity of God and not in carnal . wisdom; but
in the grace of God we have In this world."
(II Cor., 1-12.) â¢ Yet as we . are free beings,
conscience will not compel a man to do right,
for the value of the moral act is conditioned as
the freedom In -which -it is performed. Still
conscience remains as an immense power to
ward well doing. ."By what things a man
sesmeth." writes the wise man; "by thÂ« satnÂ»
also is he tormented.'" (Wis. xl:17.) Strengtheu
conscience by religion, confirm It with . God's
grace and when you have set It aright, when
you have enlightened it, appeal to it. At once
man is lifted above the things of earth, at once
he becomes Invincible amid temptations, at
once he Is capable of most heroic sacrifices.
To cure this social evil, then, man must be
thrown back on what Is mightiest and best
in him,' conscience. Â¦ This is no reaching out
for the millennium.'
Always Will Be Unfortunates.
I know the weakness of human nature Â¦ and
that the're are and always will be unfortunates.
But it is part of your mission, and In this
matter you have a mission as , well as I have,
you have been sent as I have been sent, you
can come In touch with men and you can reach
women that no priest can meet, you can In
fluence them for. better or for worse, and an
account or your Influence will be exacted. If
you will.be loyal Catholic American citizens
it Is a part and the most important part of
jour apostolate to form your own conscience
aright and to work to so reduce the number of
offenses against the angelic virtue that it
will be an accepted saying that Catholics are
free from the stain. The burden of set
ting the moral standard high rests on the
shoulders of the virtuous and Intelligent men
of the-. country. You are of them and if you
Ignore your plain duty the whole mass of.the
people must, euffer. Is it difficult? rlt^-may
be. but who fears the work when . he . knows
that there are thousands to-day sitting near
the pool of saving waters looking for a help
ing hand outstretched to save them? We
should each do our- part,- we are strands in the
mighty cable that must uplift the world.
Passion Enemy of Society.
Passion is the enemy, the fttal enemy of the
Individual as of society, but rigtit conscience
is the life-giving remedy. The pagans of old
deified the ignoble passion In which man sink 3
lower than the brute, to excuse themselves at
the bar of conscience. There are. men to-day
who would dare do the same; they declare con
jugal chastity in men is hardly to be expected
and they claim virginal chastity is a hopeless
impossibility. Fortified and strengthened by
grace we must, step into the darkness and "like
a pillar of -fire"- lead the children of God in the
way that shows not only that conjugal chastity
isÂ«a strict obligation; but virginal chastity is
a glorious fact. St. Paul need not be sum
moned to prove this; the- example of Stt John,'
beloved among the apostles for his spotless in
nocence need not be cited. -The truth is plain;
you need not the voice of the prophet whose
life was turned into eloquence by the burning
coal from God's altar to tell you this; you need
no Jeremiah . to; touch you with, his lamenta
tions over the sorrows that have resulted from
the laying aside of this truth. -
Must Protect Mothers and Sisters.
You need but remember, gentlemen, that
blind and Intoxicated lust is no respecter of
persons; that you .. have . mothers and sisters,
wives, and daughters, who must be protected;
you need but remember that their salvation and
yours depend upon the control â¢ you exercise
ever self and the salutary Influence you bring
to bear on others. It is a battle between honor
and disgrace, between life and death, and you
must be In the thick thereof. .When God calls
and souls are In danger,' it is and should be the
ambition of every right thinking man who has
at heart the welfare of the family and the glory
of the church to fall into line and fight with
vigor and resolution till victory crowns his.ef
forts. As to the methods that are to be pur
sued in this warfare, neither the time nor the
place call for their discussion. But there Is
one and that is the _ foundation â¢ of
your own Individual conscience., and next to It
comes strenuous endeavor on your part toward
.forming af healthy public conscience, j
Tou must begin with yourself and you must
strive to bring every other man ' to make the
one resolve which every, man with a sense or
honor, justice and manhood should make, and
that Is neither to seek nor to accept that for
which he Is not willing to pay the full price,'
"for better, for worse, ', for "richer, -for poorer,
in sickness .and in- health, until death do us
part.". . ' ' . . ' ' . "' Â¦ â¢
A SOLEMN requiem high mass was
celebrated at St. Mary's Cathe
dral yesterday morning' for the
repose Sf the souls of the de-
ceased members of the Young
Men's Institute. The mass was celebrat
ed by the Rev. G. B. Hannigan, assisted
by Fathers Ilamm'and Dcmpsey. Father
Ryan of St. BrlgitTs Church acted as
master of ceremonies. The services were
largely attended by members of the order
and by the relatives and friends of those
whom death had removed from their
midst. ; . -
. The sermon, which -was delivered by
Father J. W. Sullivan, was an able effort.
Father Sullivan chose as his text, "Seek
not death in the error of your life, neither
procure ye destruction . by the works of
your hands." He spoke at. length on the
need of keeping alive the- memory of de
parted ones, and then called the attention
of the congregation to the hemousness ol
the crime' lately committed in this city,
and told his listeners that it was their
duty to solve the mystery surrounding
the deed. . . .
leather Sullivan's sermon is as follows.
The thought of the dead, how they are sit
uated, is a solemn, a deep thought, a tnougnt
dear to us ail, one having so lasting a hold on
the human heart that no other can ever usurp
its placeâ a thought bringing back the mem
ory of all that makes earth beautiful and lull of
joy stirring up the souls' of old and young to
the'.reeollection of things that were but are no
more of loved ones who but yesterday crossed
over the river to meet their God. Grlei for
the dead, honor to the dead rank among the
most tender and .refining of the human feel
ings, and religion, always In harmony with na
ture, when nature rests within the bounds of
conscience. Is In accord full and complete with
this feeling. She exalts and blesses it. and
brings it up to the plane of the supernatural.
"Jesus wept at the tomb of j Lazarus and as
they saw the tears pour down irom his sacred
eyes they whispered among themselves, Behold,
how he loved him." â John, xi.
Holy Thought to Pray for Dead.
In the temple of Jerusalem prayer and sacri
'fiees were ottered for the dead soldiers of the
great warrior Judas Maccabeus. He thinking
well and religiously concerning the resurrection
sent 12,000 pieces of silver to Jerusalem tor
sacrifice to be offered for the sln6 of the dead.
And in one pithy sentence the author of the
book of Maccabees gives us the whole essence
of the consoling truth, to which we cling when
it adds: "it is therefore a holy and whole
scme thought to pray for the dead, that they
may be loosed from sins."
â¢To commemorate, then, the dead, to do honor
to the dead, you are here to-day, their com r
rades, their brothers. You . are here in the
sanctuary of the living God. "who giveth and
who taketh away." You are lure in numbers
before the altar and under the Image of Christ
crucified, "whose soldiers you are." You are
here hi the spirit of loyalty to your .religion
and' brotherly love for those of your compan
ions whom the hand of death Has taken from
your ranks, when, perhaps, they were In the
midst of the battle struggling to strengthen
your society, . taken, it may be. after they had
fought the good fight and were ripe -for their
reward. ' . ; *.â¢Â¦-Â¦Â¦
We Essily Forget.
How easily, too, we forget the dead, .{hose
whose image seems to be indelibly Impressed
on our minds, every feature, the look, the smile,
the expression â all have a living meaning for
us. We think we shall never forget them. But
after a while, like a fading photograph, they
begin to disappear, like a flower culled from
the bush â the perfume lingers a while, weakens
and is gone; but our church like a good' mother
knows how excellent the effect this remem
brance has and keeps their memory before us.
Therefore, we commemorate the day or All
Souls, therefore the monthly and yearly remem
brance; yea., and .the daily plea." Give them,
O Lorfl. eternal rest and let perpetual light
chine upon them. It is to remind the living of
the dead and to call to mind the salutary les
sons the silent but 1 eloquent dead whisper to
them. .
And in this age of . restlessness, of excite
ment, of progretsion and aggression we need
the quieting and . sedative effect of such feel
ings. We need that our minds shall be brought
down to the thoughts of our mortality, that
scenes such as this will pass away from us
and that other .faithful souls and loving heart:*
will pray that eternal peace may come, to us
when we shall have gone to the house of
eternity. -â¢ ' .
Thoughts like these will come to , you; Â¦ re
tain them, let not the world with its concerns
drive them out; let them sink deep into yÂ«ur
soul.-. â¢ ' â¢. --. ,
Think of Future Work.
It eeems to me that this occasioti for honor
ing the memory cf our departed brothers is
also an opportune one for us living members to
think over the wcrk which lies before us and
which must be done.
Our Growth la Influenced.*
The fundamental iaw of all living creatures
is growth: they must advance or they must
fall back; there is to be no standstill; advance
pent or retrogression; life or death is the
crucial te6t Creation is no mere experiment
whose master is uncertain. The smallest seed
produces only that plant whose name has been
written in Invisible characters in Its heart.
"Can the fig tree bear grapes: or the vine
figs?" (James 111:12.) Our type Is God; to
his image and likeness 4 we have been made.
The germ of theÂ»Chr!st-Hke life has been Im
planted in us by the one true God at baptism
and this germ must unfold Into another Christ.
"Know you not your own selves that Christ Is
in you?" writes St. Paul, and quoted
by St. Luke in the Acts of the Apostles,
xlll:25. he sayÂ«: "It is he who giveth to all
life and breath and all things," and again.
"In him we- live and move and have our be
ing." (xvii:28.)
Our growth spiritually is influenced, aided/
sustained by our conditions, our environment.
The 6eed that fell on the rocky soil faded anJ
died. . while that which fell on the good soil
flourished and produced a rich crop. To In
crease and to aid our growth in the super
natural order, that we may add cubit? to our
stature, that we may successfully put off the
old man and put on the new. the church in her
wisdom has established orders and communi
ties and congregations. She has gathered her
children close together, to strengthen the weak,
to encourage the fearful, to help the helpless.
She has Â¦ formed and encouraged societies of
laymen as well as of clerics, for In organiza
tion there Is strength. She would bring the
fainthearted and the weary, the lukewarm and
the novice Into surroundings that will foster
their growth in spiritual life that they may
evolve In themselves that germ of the Christ
like life which God has sown' In their souls.
It Is consonant with this principle of action In
her feast that she has encouraged and fostered
the Young Men's Institute.
Be Faithful to Your Mission.
Our City Is Appalled.
Ton gentlemen are members of a distinctly
Catholic organization, and as euch you have a
two-fold mission: to uphold In your own lives
the integrity of your faith and to uphold the
idea that Catholicity and the highest type of
citizenship, are complementary terms.- And
Inasmuch as you are faithful to your mis
sion in so much will you be" on the advance,
in bo much will you be growing. This work,
however, must begin' with and In yourselves.
Reverence yourselves. Begin with reverencing
this your body, , reverence it as God's handi
work, fearfully and wonderfully ' made by an
allwlse being. Contemplate â¢ It, and contem
plate it with awe, if only for its marvelously
subtle mechanism. But reverence it still more
as the consecrated temple of God's spirit.
"Know you not," asks St. Paul, "that your
members' are the temple of the Holy Ghost?"
Do not/neglect that body, do not misuse it
before ,*H things, do not defile and desecrate it.
"Know you not that your bodies are the mem
bers of. Christ?" Shall I then take the mem
bers of Christ and make them members of an
harlot? God forbid, says the same apostle.
. Members of the institute, the problem: of so
cial . Â»urity has been presented to us lately un
der most particularly heinous circumstances.
It must be solved. Will you accept the chal
lenge? Our city stands appalled to-day at the
devilish crime of a brute. We shall not inquire
into the motive of his atrocious act ' we shall
not stop to run the beast â¢ to his lair. The
hands of our citizens are up in unspeakable
horror and Just indignation.' -We 'stand aghast
at the deed The blood of woman has been
spilled to sate the lust of man, and that blood
is crying to heaven for vengeaa.ee. it prays
the whirlwind of God's wrath to sweep j down
upon us.
Who knows when the measure of that wrath
wjll be filled io overflowing? Who knows but
that the dire fate of Sodom may be meted out
to us? It is time "indeed that the conscience
of the country should bÂ» awakened, and rud.ely
awakened, to the terrible curse of social im
purity that is fact settling like a black pall
upon us.- Whene* the cause springs we' will
not ask. It exists, it lives, it thrives In ' out*
very midst, its alms are lengthening and its
vitals. are waxing . stronger, and who is there
that will nay it, "thus far and no farther." t
Penetrates Our Homes.
We have purity congresses, we have federa
tions of women, we have individuals struggling
It penetrate* Into the secrecy and sacredness
of homes and it boldly Aaunts its hideous robes
in public bÂ«f ore. our,. children and ourselves.
The maudlins and selfishness of the drunken
beast and the red hand of murder follow In its
wake. I* there no. spot sacred from It? -Is
there no power that can check It T Is there no
strength that can crush It? ? This is the problem
we must combat, Â¦ and the way in .which i you
measure swords with it will be & test of your
real growth. "Â¦ Â¦ ' â¢ â¢

have occurred in Mexico and this country
are charged to the fugitives. The officials
of this county and the authorities of Mex

Special Dispatch to The Call.
George Dow, secretary, of the Metal
Trades Association, says he knows nothing
about the proposed plan except what has
been already published.- "No advices have
been received here to: my knowledge,"- ho
said, "In reference to a . general plan' of
arbitration." .;â¢'Â¦:Â¦â¢
Secretary. Russell I. Wisler said-: that
neither . the Iron Trades Council - nor the
Machinists' Union had received any Infor
mation, but would -..be promptly - advised
of any action by; President McConnell' of
the International Machinists' Union. .
"I have made public all the information
I have in .the premises," said Secretary
Ed Rosenberg of the Labor Council yes
terday. '.'Macarthur's telegrams were
brief, and while Lam in close touch with
the Iron Trades Council we have, nothing
as yet upon which. to formulate a" plan of
action. Macarthur : will â¢ be Where 'Â¦Â¦on
Wednesday or Thursday," when -we will
have .full advices as to the plan."' .
The executive committee, of which Sen
ator Mark Hanna is the chairman, met in
New York on Wednesday last and then
adopted { the j plan J which will be followed
probably in the 1 present instance. .This
provides for the appointment . of a â¢ com
mittee of nine, three of whom shall be
selected from each group of the executive
committee, representing capital, labor and
the general; public, whose duty it shall be
at the' request of the chairman of a
threatened strike or lockout of more than
local magnitude to use its good offices in
restoring . harmonious relations, reporting
its action to the whole committee.
Until the arrival of Walter Macarthur,
who has been in the Eastern States in
connection . with labor matters, nothing
will be known of the date of the arrival
of that portion of the executive commit
tee . . of the National Civic Federation
which will endeavor to arrange labor dif
ferences on the Pacific Coast, and partic
ularly the ironworkers' strikes.
Still the ones yet In the organization
feel that it Is a -disgrace to have it said
that any of the former members are in
mates, of an almshouse, and it is for that
reason that President Bohen of the Ex
empts has within the last few days taken
the preliminary steps toward having; a
.petition prepared for presentation to the
officials named. In that document will be
eet forth the names of " the , five old-time
firemen, their service In the department
and age and a prayer for ways and means
to secure their release from institutions
to which they have through old age> de
crepitude and adversity been , forced to
apply for admission. . . .
There is a movement afoot at this time
to awaken an interest 'in the Mayor and
Board of Supervisors In favor of five
men, pioneers of this city, who are now
inmates of almshousesâ three In this city
and two in *the Alameda County Infirm
ary. These men were in the early days
of San Francisco, 'way back in the fifties,
members of the Volunteer Fire Depart
ment, and in the days of. their younger
manhood devoted their time, their energy
ar>d their money to the interests of their
fellow citizens, ever ready to save prop
erty and life when the alarm, bell sum
moned them to duty. Their services were
free, the only reward being the conscious
ness of a voluntary labor well and faith
fully performed. In time these men be
came members of the Exempt Fire Com
pany that iwas organized many years ago
to help firemen in misfortune, give them
sepulcher in the firemen's plat when the
last rollcall was answered and to care for
their widows and orphans. So long as
that organization had a large membership
and the members contributed there was
always a sufficient fund to carry out these
laudable objects, but in . the long run of
years the angel of death carried away,
many, misfortune overtook many others
and. they were unable to keep themselves
in good standing, so they were, dropped
iron; the roll and -such were no 'longer a
charge upon the company. Those who re
mained in the organization^remembered
that their former comrades who had
dropped out through non-payment of dues
had pulled on the ropes with them and
had manned the brakes of the ' old . hand
engine, and they assisted them from time
to time with donations to keep them out
of the poorhouse. The time came, how
ever, when the little fund that remained
would not permit of any further dona
tions, as what there was had to be hus
banded for the benefit of the few who re
main faithful to ' the organization and
l>ay their monthly stipend in order that
they may be cared for in case of sickness
in their declining days..

In addition to the remaining rounds of

In the California plate stake the Cur
tis' kennel representatives seem much the
best. In Rector, Beacon, Luxor and Fly

has a auartet hard < to beat. They all
showed great speed yesterday and ;ar<>
expected to be fighting for the big end
of-the Btake this afternoon.
The best of the other three and the
stake favorite is W. Raught's Silver
Heels. She coursed her hares like a vet
eran and showed a world of speed.
-A number of the entries showed their
inexperience, Â¦ apparently not knowing
what was expected of them when they
were sent In pursuit of the hare. In the
betting in the long-odds book Silver Heels
is at 3 to 5, Missouri 2 to 1, Spencer 3 to 1,

D. J. Healey's young, greyhounds by

On occasions of. this, kind associations
always furnish some .highly Â¦ spiced, de

valued at $2000, happened to be the offer
ing. Eight started for the prise. -and
Frangible. "a 00-pounder arid 10 , to 1 in the

Janice, owned" by Green ' Morris and
piloted by Winnie O'Connor, ruled favor
ite for the race,. with Black Dick, the en
try of h. V. Bell, second choice. Owing
to the condition of the. track, the odds
about Frangible fell; from 10 to 6. Dick
Dwyer made one of his prettiest starts at
the post and Diderot and Frangible sailed
away, in the lead. Diderot tired about the
time a mile had been traversed and Fran
gible, swerving : somewhat, but forging
ahead, won by more than two lengths. It
looked -' as If O'Connor, on Janice waited
too leng before making his move,' but this
may be a fallacy. 'He got up in time to
take the show. Black' Dick showed con
clusively that he is no mud horse. Ransch,
who rode Diderot, claimed a foul against
the winner. It was not allowed. .
TO be sure, there was no Une-up
nor rbllcall, but without exag
geration the big holiday gather
ing at Oakland track yesterday
appeared quite as large if not
overshadowing the vast crowd which wit
nessed the deciding of the Burns handi
cap on the Saturday previous. While a
bit foreboding, the weather was pleasant,
'but the track was far from being what
was dedlred.'. It had drained surprisingly
well, though, being classed as sticky and
holding/instead of sloppy. The betting
ring, was jammed with j people and \ the
grand stand wQre a gala look, the hun
dreds of femininity being attired accord
ing to fashion's latest . decree, while the
verandas Â¦'. of . the " clubhouse were dotted
here and there .with .interested coteries
of society people.'- Everything passed off
without accident of any kind to mar the
sport, even the overenthuslasfic forgetting
to register by signal or gesture any kind
of objection with the judges over any of
the close finishes. â¢

The contestants and the time they re
quired to run the distance are as follows:
the heats, as the Oakland boys were no
match for the local athletes. Owing to
Garcia's mistake, however, the average
time made by the Olympic racers was but
-little better than that of their opponents.
The average time made by the Olympic
Club men was 24:48 3-5, and that of the
High School runners was 24:50 1-5.
ThÂ© athletes started on their- long run
yesterday from the panhandle, near Baker
street. They then took, the , main drive to
the south park road, thence around the
deer park, regaining the main drive, along
which they ran to the panhandle, the fin
ishing point being at the Ashbury avenue
entrance to the park.

Club. - Its athletes won- the race by just
eight seconds, j and would have won ' by
eight 'minutes had not Garcia, the speed
iest distance man of the club, rah three
fourths of a mile off the prescribed'epurse.
The occasion was the annual Olympic
Club cross-country road race for. a~ cup,
which must be won three times before
becoming the property of any one compet
ing team. Last year it was won by Oak
land High School. Yesterday's race was
not an exciting affair owing -to the small
number of entries. It attracted a large
attendance of spectators. The weather
conditions were perfect, but the heavy
rains of the last few days put the roads
in such a condition that fast time was
impossible. L>undy of Oakland High
School, who ran the course in 23:01, made
the fastest time and won the medal of
fered by the Olympic Club for that
achievement. He ran against Garcia, the
Olympic crack, and would have been beat
en by him had the latter not mistaken the
road. When Garcia took the wrong road
he was fuly three-eighths of a mile ahead
of Lundy. /

LOUISVILLE, Ky., Feb. 21â Terry Mc-
Govern defeated Dave Sullivan In the
arena of the Southern Athletic Club to
xiieht in fifteen rounds of as desperate
a fight as was ever seen. From the first
tap of the gong until the end it was
slap-bang, hammer and ' tongs nearly
every second, both men working away
with all the energy they possessed.
McGovern. knowing winning- the fight
meant his position in the front ranks as
a boxer, was after his man every sec
ond. In a majority of the rounds he was
on the aggressive. Sullivan was forced
to do far more defensive work than his
opponent. The latter put up a wonderful
iiget, and was game to the core. When
the finish came he was groggy and going
last. The chances are he would not have
lusted many more rounds, even had he
risen to his feet before Fltzslmmons
counted ten.

Brokers Make Beports.
The following sales are reported by
Shainwald, Buckbee & Co.:
The past week has been marked by
quite a number of large sales of realty,
the most- important of any that has been
made public being those involved In the
acquisition of a building site for the Pa
cific-Union Club. Others reach good fig
ures, and the week has beatenthe record
of any similar period in the annals of the
city. The rains have stimulated every
one. -Other causes have been at work to
heighten public confidence in the business
outlook for the immediate future, not the
least of which is the concerted move of
the counties of Northern California to
have their resources duly advertised and
understood., and the determination of the
overland transportation lines - to put into
effect colonist and homeseekers' rates for
passengers for the express purpose of peo
pling the vast and fruitful domain that
lies in the great region between the Sier
ras and the Coast Range Mountains.
Millions could find homes In that part of
California and nnd profit under climatic
conditions that are desirable. Coupled
with the colonist and . homeseekers 1 rates
are the efforts of the transportation lines
to advertise California in the. East, which
* r f. co .ntinuous and well directed, the re
sult being that the central part of the
State and also San. Francisco is now be
coming known in thousands of Eastern
households where ignorance before ex-
Sales Are Important.
One sign of the intention of .the land
lords to get higher rents Is supplied by
the action of the large Investment com
pany that holds the former Blythe prop
erties on Market and Geary streets and
Grant avenue. Beginning with the next
month iacreased rents will be asked for
the properties on the two streets and ave
nue mentioned. In one instance the in
crease 1b more than WOO per- month.
Speaking generally, as viewed by tenants
who talked with a Call reporter,' the in
crease amounts to something like 25 per
cent in some Instances. In others It is
greater. Some of the property is leased
for a term of years and the rent cannot
be raised during that period. Notices of
the increased rents have caused no little
talk among the former Blythe tenants.
With a period of, building activity un
oqualed in the winter season In.the'his
tory of San Francisco, with large sales In
the beginning of the year that -seem to
indicate that the total transactions of
twelve months cannot fall short of $40,003.
oOO, If, indeed, they-, do. not exceed that
mark, there Is also 'a steady Influx of
strangers and capital from the* East' into
this city, which Is surprising to local ob
servers, aware as they fully!- are'.of ; .the
great commercial and - industrial .-future
that certainly Is In store for thei metropo
lis of the Pacific Coast. While : new
buildings are going up In every section of
the city there are few eligible houses to
rent. Each structure 1s In demand when
it Is completed, and this Is true of about
every part of the city. The time of the
owners of realty to realize from . their
holdings in rents has arrived.
Realty Record for the -Week
Is Encouraging to All
the Brokers.
Large Increase Ordered
