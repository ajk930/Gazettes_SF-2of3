The congress adjourned till to-morrow. To-night, from 9 to 11 o'clock, the;",
â¢was a reception to all the delegates and visitors, held in the halls of the Na
tional JIuseum.
Two amendments to the constitution were adopted. The first tacked on sec
tion 1 a provision that no one shall be eligible to hold office in the national
society until she has been a member thereof two years. The second amendment
adopted, which refers to the same section, provided that no person shall hold
office more than two years successively.
"When the congress assembled this afternoon Mrs. M. B. Tulloch of this city,
chairman of the committee on credentials, presented her report. It showed that
S17 delegates are entitled to vote. This Is an increase of 57 over last year. The
number includes, besides the forty-seven State regents, 600 chapter regents and
249 delegates. The report recommended that the roll of the convention be called
by chapters, to not only commemorate "those sacred names, but emphasize the
record of historical places."
The report was adopted and the roll was then called. Many of the chapters
are named after Revolutionary heroes.
The congress was called to order
this morning by \he president general,
Mrs. Charles W. Fairbanks, wife of
the United States Senator from Indi
ana. Led by Percy 8. Foster of this
city, the congress sang "The .Star-
Spangled Banner." Mrs. Fairbanks
then delivered her address of wel
come. After expressing- her gratifica
tion at the numbers of those present and what they represented, Mrs. Fair
banks urged upon every Daughter the cultivation in the highest degree of rev
erence to law, devotion to the flag and preservation of the interests in general
of the organization. She referred to the pending- proposition to reduce the
membership of the order, as the congress was becoming too unwieldy, and
said whatever measure was adopted along this line it would have in view full
and complete representation of all the chapters in the country. She showed that
there were now approximately 600 chapters, thirty-four chapters having been
added during the past year, increasing the membership by 3S06. This makes
the total membership over 40,000.
The morning session closed with a response by Mrs. John F. Swift of Cali
fornia to the address of Mrs. Fairbanks.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 17.â The

to-day. About 800 delegates and
others representing chapters in States
throughout the country were present.
The congress has before it many mat
ters of importance to the welfare of
tho Daughters. These include the
erection of a continental memorial
hall in this city, the adjustment of in
ternal disputes among some of the
Western chapters which have caused
much trouble in the past, needed
amendments in the constitution of the
ordv.r, and projects for securing pen

The previous question was then ordered, but Richardson thereupon offered a
motion: to "recommit the * rule with instructions to report it back amended so aa
to, open the bill for amendment under the five-minute rule.
Dalzell immediately made the point that the motion was dilatory. Speaker
Henderson . and : Richardson had a sharp exchange over the point of order, which
the "Speaker": sustained.' -.
Richardson then appealed from the decision of the chair, and the Speaker de
clined to hear argument on the appeal, because the previous ' question already
had been ordered.
/;. Dalzell "moved to lay * the appeal on . tha table. -
This. motion was carried, 165. to 123. Calderhead (Rep.) of Kansas voted wtth

MINORITY LEADER SPRINGS HIS SURPRISE.
Ball of Texas denounced the rule as but another step in the parliamentary ev
olution by which individualism in the House was being crushed and a few men
were enthroned as the autocrats to dominate its will. The reason for the presen
tation of the rule, he declared, was because It was .necessary to gag two Repub-^
lican members of the Ways and Means Committee, a number of the Republicans
on the floor and all the Democrats of the House. He referred to the report in the
newspapers that even the President had become converted to the view that. the
"iron hand" .wa's necessary to prevent a wholesale revision of the tariff.
At this point Babcock of ."Wisconsin, one of the Republican members of the
"Ways and Means Committee to whom Ball had referred, read a statement of his
reasons for favoring the adoption of the rule. It was to the effect thit after con
sultation he and his colleagues did not consider it wise to jeopardize fhe passage
of the repeal bill by complicating matters, and he gave notice that at the first
opportunity he would press for the consideration of his bill to amend the steal
schedule. '
Hay of Virginia declared that the pending rule would humiliate every member
on the floor, because it prevented the offering of a single amendment to this bill.
It was such a display of cowardice as never befdre had been witnessed In thÂ«
House. , (Applause.) "When the bill went to the Senate it would be debated and
amended, but by this rule the House would be deprived of Its rightful function.
.Cannon of Illinois argued earnestly In favor of the adoption of the rule. Even
If other revenue reduction was advisable.it should not stand, he. said. In the way
of the repeal- of taxes gathered in the treasury from the people, there to consti
tute a prize upon exploitation. "Let us," said he in conclusion, addressing his
Bide of the House, "take the responsibility for the repeal of these taxes, as we
took the responsibility for their imposition." . - :^ v Vi'
Richardson closed the debate for the minority. In doing so he offered to yield
half his time to any one on the Republican side who cared to oppose the adoption
of the rule. He paused when he had made the offer.' but no Republican rose.
Smiling faces looked over at him from across the aisle.
"No gentleman on ; that Bide la opposed to 'this rule," said he, sarcastically.
"With. your majority of forty It will-be very easy to, adopt 'it, but Is it not
Btrange that with such a majority such a rule should be necessary?" He in
sisted" that there were members- on the other aide who-were restive under the
demand of their constituents for a revision of some of the tariff schedules and
that they would have hard work explaining their action. The gentleman from
Wisconsin (Babcock), he declared, could not go back to his constituents with
the lame excuse he had offered on the floor. "This is his last opportunity," said
he. "and the gentleman knows it There will be no other opportunity to give his
people relief, and if he tries to explain, his course, let one of his constituents
ask him why he voted for this rule." In concluding:, Richardson said that those
on his side favored the repeal of the war taxes;' in fact, that If they had their
way they' would have been repealed long ago.
Dalzell -closed the debate on the rule. In view, of, the solicitude of the gentle
man from Virginia (Hay) and the . gentleman from Texas (Ball) regarding the
situation in .the "House, he said he would refer to. some; history. After recalling
attention ; to : the fact that not a member on the other side had raised his voice
against the:adoptlon of the rule for the consideration of the Philippine tariff
bill, a' rule which, he said, was >s drastic as this one. he told how. the Democrats
of the Fifty-third Congress had swallowed 643 amendments to the "Wilson bU?
without even having . them" read in the House. \
PKOTESTS AGAINST THE "IRON HAND" RULE.
r "T T ASHINGTON, Feb. 17.-The
\ /Y/ ' unexpected happened in the
]y/}\. House to-day when the bill
' to repeal the war revenue
taxes was passed unanimously without
a word of debate. This action was the
outcome of a challenge thrown down
by Richardson ' of Tennessee, the
minority leader, after the adoption by
a , strict party .vote of a special order
for the consideration of the bill which
permitted debate on it until 4 oclock
to-morrow afternoon, but cut off all
opportunity to offer amendments ex
cept such as had been agreed to by the
Ways \ and Means Committee. The
adoption of the rule had been preceded
by a stormy debate, in the course of
which the Democrats protested against
the application of the "gag," which
Hay of Virginia claimed was made to
prevent, a free expression not only by
'the Democrats, but by some Repub
licans; special attention being directed
toward ' Babcock of Wisconsin, the
father of the bill, to amend the steel
schedule ~ of the present law. They
also charged that such a method of
procedure was minimizing the in
fluence of the - House and making It
simply a machine to register the decrees of the few men in control.
When the rule was adopted, by a vote of 158 to 120, Richardson, to em
phasize the fact that debate on the bill could accomplish nothing and that de
liberation oh it would be fruitless, asked unanimous consent that the bill be placed
upon- its passage. Not an objection was voiced and the vote was taken forth
with. I Every vote. 278 in number, was cast in the affirmative.
There was a large attendance on the floor of the House and in the gallery
in anticipation of a debate on the bill to repeal the war revenue taxes. Just
prior to the assembling of the House the Comitttee on Rules met and agreed
upon the form j of a special rule for the consideration of the bill, by the terms of
which it would brought to a vote at 4 o'clock to-morrow.
The chaplain, in his Invocation, prayed that the life, of Representative
Shephard of Texas, who is dangerously 111, might be spared.
DALZELL PBESENTS SPECIAL ORDER AGREED TJPOU.
After some minor business had been cleared away, Dalzell, from the Com
mittee on Rules, presented the special order agreed upon by that committee. DaV
zell explained, the effect of the rule. This measure, he said, -was presented to re
deem a pledge made when the war revenue taxes were Imposed that when the
necessity for them ceased they would be repealed. This was a measure on which.
: he took it, there was practical unananimity of sentiment on both sides of tha
House. It was a simple repeal measure and it was deemed wise that It should be
brought to a vote without complication on extraneous issues.
..- At the conclusion of this brief statement Dalzell yielded thirty minutes to
Underwood of Alabama, also of the Committee on Rules. .The Alabama mem
ber protested against the adoption of the rule. not. he said, because it provided
for the consideration of a bill to reduce taxation, but because It prevented indi
'vidual "members from* exercising their own judgment or "carrying out the wishes
of their constituents as to 'what portion, of the excessive taxes should be re
pealed. As an instance of a tax whlch.it was not advisable to repeal, he cited
the inheritance tax', a tax which; he said, was levied on a class that was not
reached by other taxation. Underwood said he did not think a general tax re
vision should be made, as such revision, whether good or bad, would unsettle present
conditions and might lead to disorder. He referred to the stagnation in business
Â¦ which existed pending the enactment of both the "Wilson and Dingley bills in
support of that statement. He thought that the proper method of reducing
duties at this time should be through reciprocity agreements made in pursuance
of Congressional enactment, and he sent to the Clerk's desk and had read the
following amendment representing his ideas in this particular:
"That for. the purpose of readjusting the present- duties on importations into
the United States, so as to raise sufficient . revenues to support the Government
economically administered, and at the same' time to* encourage the export trade
of this country, the President bfthÂ£ United States is authorized and empowered
to negotiate trade contracts with foreign nations, wherein mutual concessions are
made, looking to the expansion of our foreign trade; provided, that said trade
contracts before coming Into operation shall be submitted to the Congress of- the
United. States 'for ratification, amendment or rejection."

Brooklyn Bridge Is Kept Clear.
On the elevated "lines there was consid

by the evening rush hours all trains were
running .on time, although enormously
overcrowded owing to the interruption of
the surface lines. â¢
The Brooklyn bridge wa3 kept clear of
snow from the time the storm began, but
both the elevated and trolley cars were
crowded to their, utmost capacity, al

preferred the perilous passage of the fer

The eastern part of New York State,
f r om this city to the Canadian border, was
Â¦swept-toy a blizzard such as had not tjeen
experienced for fourteen years. Up to
midnight reports Â¦Â¦ showed that sixteen
counties had received in force the effects
of trie gale and the- accompanying fall of
snow. .These counties were Dutchess,
Orange, Ulster, Albany, Schoharie,
Schenectady, Montgomery, Saratoga, Es
sex, Columbia, Rensselaer, Washington,
Clinton, Onedia, Onondaga and Chemung.
Thus it will be seen that it did not extend
to the western part of the State, although
it waa expected there before to-morrow.
- There is a sameness about the reports
from the up-State towns. Anywhere from
four to eighteen inches of snow, wind
blowing at a hurricane rate, drifts from
six to. In one instance, 25 feet deep, are
among the feature, while there is reitera
tion of delayed trains, impaired trolley
service and impassable country roads.
--The latest reports indicate that the
worst is over, for the wind is abating and
In many places the snow has ceased fall-

New Jersey Feels the Blizzard.
Advices received from points in New
Jersey -show that the great blizzard has
been felt from Bergen County to Cape
May, and from Atlantic City to Camden.'
The latest 1 advices are .that? during the
evening the storm abated greatly. The
brunt of the gale, which approached the i
dimensions of a hurricane, was felt by
the sea-coast towns', but the interior cities
and townships did not escape. Travel by
road was almost impossible, v Cities , and
villages not provided with large gangs. of
fctreet cleaners gave up the battle against
the driving snow early in the day. The
railroads were enabled to move trains by
the free useof-Bnowplows, and street-car
i- trafilc all over. the State was stopped until
; the sweeping machines and plows cleared
the tracks about the middle of the after
. noon. This applies to the large cities
I only, for in. the smaller places the tracks
j are so badly covered with snow that they
; may not be cleared for two days,
i There was a general suspension ;of the:
Â¦ schools in the afternoon, while the* morn-'
| Ing sessions .were only little attended. At
! most, places heard . from motions- were
Â¦made that there would be no attempt to
hold school "to-morrow. â¢ '. Â¦ ;
- Several trains were stalled near Bound
Brook for several hours, .but were released
â¢later 'in the . afternoon. Trains from New,
; York reached ".Bound .- Brook : from â¢ two to"
j three hours Jate, and these with two en-
I gines attached. Â¦.
j By night the situation was much im-
I proved and passenger trains on all trunk'
in boats from Staten Island were compelled
to put back and return' to the navy yard.
Four thousand men were set to work to
clear- the streets .. of Â¦ Manhattan earlv In
the afternoon. . Of these half were en

JEALOUS rage of a jilted lover, the
police believe, prompted the brutal
shooting of Annie Anderson ' ! on
Sunday night. The police are satis
fied that the young Swedish woman
who was mysteriously shot down Sunday
night almost within the shadows of the
home of E.L.. Snell. 224 Ashbury street,
where she was employed as a servant girl,
knows more than she cares to tell con
cerning the identity of the man who shot
her and then escaped in the darkness.
Captain Seymour's detectives are hot on
the trail of Anton Anderson,' a native, of
Sweden, .who is said to have been an
ardent -admirer of the injured woman.
They were unable to locate Anderson last
night, but they will redouble their efforts
to get him in their toils to-day to bring
him before Chief. Wittman and Captain
Seymour, who will ask him several ques
tions in' connection with his acquaintance
With Annie Anderson and his whereabouts

vestigation,: without even taking into
consideration : other "improbable? circum
stances, prove conclusively that Miss An

robbery. Mrs.^SneH- '-was wide awake
when she heard, her servant girl scream
frantically. ' Ifwaa a shrill terror-stricken
cry, and .fully. .'. a ; v quarter., of ..a. minute
elapsed before' the shot; was fired." ;.
v Presuming' that the statement of ' Mis's
Andefson'as to the manner in. which "sne
was . assaulted be true it â¢ is convincing
to disprove' the. theory that she
was the victim, of a footpad. In addition
there is another .convincing, fact to con
sider. When- the. woman staggered blind
ly into the hallway of the Snell home' she
held her purse containing $5 in her hand.
If it- was' a footpad who shot her he
would have had ample time to relieve her
of the purse in the Interval" between the
time she first screamed and â¢ the t time , tb e
shot was fired. . When Mrs'.' Snell ran to
her ; front window ' she saw.' the wounded
woman* - reeling down Ashbury street,
about ten yards away from her- home and
directly in front of the residence of Mrs.
Hetty, two doors above. ' â¢ â¢ Â¦Â¦ v-. .
' About this time Miss Coleman, â¢ a young
lady -who lives across the. street, at No.

ascertain the cause of the shooting "which
had so suddenly disturbed the quiet neigh
borhood. While Miss Anderson was still
standing on the doorstep of the Snell resi
dence waiting- for .somebody- to open the
door Miss Coleman looked up "Ashbury

He seemed to.be waiting to see whether
or not' the woman got into the house, and
as soon as the light' was thrown on the
sidewalk from the opening of the door
the man turned and ran swiftly down
Hayes street, still keeping the center of
the cartracks. This' man was- evidently
the would-be assassin. "..;Â¦ It. would be more,
natural" for a man who committed a deed
of this kind under a motive of jealousy
to -stand and wait to see whether or not
his -'. victim succeeded in getting into a
house where he . knew she lived than Â¦ it
would be. for a footpad, 'who always seeks
cover,and makes tracks from the scene
of his crime the moment the deed is com
mitted... â¢ - - *â¢ Â¦ :Â¦-.--
. The police believe that they will have
the mystery completely solved before an
other day has passed. Last night several
detectives were scouring the town for thÂ»
much wanted Anderson. He could not be
found around his. usual haunts. This fact
strengthened their suspicions that they
were on the right scent.
Storm Beaches Pennsylvania.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 17.-The heavy .
snowstorm which began in this section at
10 o'clock last night ceased at 5 o'clock
this afternoon, the fall of snow being : the
heaviest In three years. A high wlnd'ac
<jomf>anied.. the snow, to-night the
wind is rapidly diminishing." The greatest
fall of snow occurred at Atlantic City,
which was the center of the storm this
morning. The Weather -Bureau there re
ports that seventeen inches fell and^that
the maximum velocity of the wind was
thirty-four miles. Cape May reported a
snowfall of eight inches. In ; this . city
eleven inches of snow was recorded . at
the Weather Bureau, and in - the interior ,
of Pennsylvania snow fell in depths vary
ing from one- to six inches. Snow was
reported to be falling to-night in the
northeastern . mountainous" section of Â¦ the
State. â¢ " r. -. ,
With the exception of the stranding of
the. schooner Anna Murray,; from Boston

that there are no vessels in distress. The
Murray went ashore during the thickest
of- the storm this morning,. and her-crew
was rescued by life-savers; by means yf

stranded and is full of water.'.
The steam railroads centering in this
city were much .hampered. .Trains V.were
greatly delayed and in some . instances
stopped. " The greatest difficulty - was ex
perienced within the city limits Â¦ and on"
the lines leading to New York and the
seashore. Trains to the west and south
from here had comparatively ,-llttle trou
ble. On all the railroads much difficulty
was encountered â¢in-"., moving ' suburban
trains. ;- The schedules . early .in the;day
became badly tangled. 'Railroad commu
nication between here and Atlantic ; City;
was tied up for; a time, and when, trains
did get moving they, were .from , two > to
three hours late. The entire;railroad;sit
uation is greatly improved to-night. Street
car traffic in this city Â¦ and- the- suburbs
became demoralized early in the day,- and
no attempt- was made; to keep' schedule
time. Some lines were blocked for hours,
but with the: ending of the storm; traffic
began to improve, and by morning it is
expected the service vÂ»ill be fully resumed;

timately acquainted.- Whether or not the
friendship ripened into a, courtship is not
known, but the developments of yesterday
prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that
the young woman took particular pains
to conceal her friendship with Anderson.
He met her outside of the Snell resi
dence on nights when she. was permitted
to go Out by her.-emnloyer and it said
that "Anderson also called on- Miss Ander

ily were on a recent trip to Los -'Angeles.
Â¦Found Telltale Letters.
Policeman Nelson, who has been acting
as interpreter for the Injured woman,
held a long conversation with her yester
day, ' and she made j admissions to him
which disprove the statements she made
immediately after the shooting. Miss An
derson requested' Nelson to go to the
Snell -residence and get several letters
which she had among her effects. She
said they contain^ information which
she did noO want anybody to read. Ac
companied by* Detective Dinan, Policeman
Nelson went directly to the residence 1 of
the Snell family. Mrs. Snell met the of
ficers at the door, and being anxious to
comply with any request that might lead
to the identity of the fiend who did the
shooting or throw 'light on the- mystery
in any way. conducted them to a rather
cozy room in .the .attic, where.Miss'An
derson slept. The officers rummaged the
injured woman's effects and found several
letters, one of which gave, them an im
portant clew to the solution of the mys
tery. It was a letter of warning "from
her half-brother' Olsen.' In the letter he
wrote- that I he'-, was sorry that -he~ had
thrown the man 1 - Anderson : In his. sister Is
path. The letter "contained other informa
tion bearing on the case, the exact natufe
of which the : police refused :to divulge; ; :
Miss 'Anderson was. closely questioned
about her. acquaintance with -Anderson,
but she showed a disposition" to evade- the
issue. Policeman' Nelson ' Importuned u her
to unseal her lips,', but - she clung .tena
ciously to the '.story r .she" told onthe pre
vious night/ eliminating nothing save the

Staten Islanders Suffer.
Staten Islanders suffered more than the
residents of any at the boroughs of
Greater New York. The boats were all
much behind time and no effort was made
to keep schedule time, the main trouble
being due to the great masses of ice
packed In the slips at St. George.- The
island itself v.-as completely sxjowed un
der and the movement of trolley, cars or
trains were brought to a halt. Even
sleighs were Â» unable to make their way
through the great drifts. In the after
noon a few trains were got through on the
North Shore by using the big freight en
gines of the Baltimore and Ohio road. De
railed trains stopped all traffie- on the
South Shore line.
The conditions of traffic were in every
respect greater than In the great blizzard
of 1SSS.
Telegraph and telephone service in New
York experienced little interruption, for
while the snow was heavy there was no
elept to break the wires.
The fleet of warships lying off Quaran
tine to await the arrival of Prince Henry
was for hours cut off by floating ice from
communication with the shore.
Forty. marines who put off to the ships
The congestion of traffic on the Man
hattan street car lines was severe during
the morning, when many of the avenues
were blocked with long 'lines' of stalled
cars. On Broadway wheel traffic was con
lined to narrow lanes between high snow
hills, and along these cabs, trucks and
cars crawled at a snail's pace. From
other thoroughfares truck j traffic disap
peared almost entirely. . ; - <-
In the shopping district " the blockade
was so complete that several of the great
department stores closed at 4 o'clock* Â«
Throughout Brooklyn the blockade was
even more general than in Manhattan
and little progress- was made by the
street-cleaning department beyond open
ins cross walks on the principal streets.
Coney Island, Fort Hamilton and Canar
sle were completely cut off from all com
munication from over the Brighton Beach
road, on which half a dozen trains were
helplessly stalled at one time. During
the day not over C9 per cent of the cars
of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit svstem
were In operation and thousands of per
sons were compelled to make their way
on foot to the ferries.
There was considerable delay in the ar
rival of, the malls. The Chicago maiL
due at 4:45 o'clock, did not get .in until
7:35 a. m. and the Washington ' was an
hour and a quarter late. The local deliv
eries of mail were hampered by the diffi
culty of driving the wagons "through the
ssnow-incumbered streets. All outgoing
mails were closed from thirty minutes to
an hour before the usual time. Msflls on
the New York Central were from two to
three hours late and all mail service be
tween this city and points on Long Island
was practically suspended. The trains on
iUl lines terminating in Jersey City were
hours behind time during the morning,
but toward evening the schedules were
more nearly maintained. On the New
1'ork Central through trains were being
moved nearly on time by taking off the
local trains.

NEW YORK, Feb. 17.-New York City
has borne the brunt of the fiercest snow
storm that has struck this section of the
country since the great blizzard of 18S8.
Beginning soon after midnight the storm
increased rapidly until by daybreak the
whole city was completely snowed under.
The rising force of the gale piled the snow
in great drifts that for some time almost
suspended traffic except in the 'main thor
uughfares, where the car tracks were
kept open only by the constant use of
snowplows and sweepers.
. It Is not likely that the Council will at-,
tempt to pass the franchise over the Veto,
for Councilman -Allen has Indicated that
he Is no longer prepared to brave the
storm of public opinion and his vote, : In
all probability, would be cast In support
of the veto. . It Is probable that the case
Â¦will get into the courts through the syn
dicate beginning work on the new routes,
and Injunction proceedings will then be
commenced. .
' Enormous pressure has been brought to
bear upon Mayor Snyder to veto the fran
chises, and his political foes have given
wide circulation to a report that he has
been promise'd lofty political preferment
In exchange for his veto. Senator W. A.
Clark, they declare, has pledged the
Mayor his Influence and support in obtain
ing the. Democratic gubernatorial nomi
nation, and. in the event of his nomina
tion, has assured him of election."
.To-night a big crowd of citizens, headed
by a band, proceeded to- Mayor Snyder'a
house and gave him a serenade. Great
enthusiasm, was manifested.
Representatives of the Huntlngton-Hell
man syndicate announced to-day that no
notice would be taken of the veto and that
work on the new lines would be com
menced at once. This Is in accordance
with eminent legal opinion, which holds
that the Mayor's veto Is of no effect what
ever, as the granting of franchises rests
entirely with the legislative body.
Â¦ Has a Bearing on Politics.
This grant of the right to lay a third rail in
so many of the streets is a proposal of most
dangerous effect. Thi3 would permit in some
of the narrow streets the laying cf fclx rails,
there being double tracks in all of them, ana
would practically monopolize the main por
tions of those thoroughfares.
The most serious problem contained in this
proposed ordinance is the grant of thÂ« priv
ileges of -running freight cars and trains of
freight, cars through the streets, and the usÂ«
,of the streets for freight traffic.
The specious argument Is made that such an
unlimited right of freight traffic would prob
ably not ba exercised. .Experience teaches that
private corporations use their power and rights
to the maximum rather than to the mlnlmura.
Regarding the third -rail privilege; he
says :
Opposes Freight Privileges.
The message is lengthy, ' Mayor Snyder
going into the merits of the case in detail.
Briefly his objections may be summed up
as follows: The obnoxious freight-carry
ing privilege; the third rail clause; Inad
equate compensation to the city; dry rot
of monopoly entailed. Regarding the flr3t
subject the Mayor says:
By the proposed ordinance, the authorities

General Miles does not favor the
scheme, and if he Is called upon by the
military committees of the Senate and
the House he will undoubtedly present a
strong argument in opposition to It. Of
ficers close to General Miles: say that if
he and his officers were properly recog
nized by the War Department there
would be no friction. Whe'n General
Miles left the President he seemed de
cidedly pleased at something .the" Presi
dent had said to him. One- reporter
called after him as he descended the
stars, "Say, general, did you do any
tobogganing in there?"' General Miles
was tickled by the question, and his
laughter penetrated to an anteroom,
where other callers were waiting for an
opportunity to see Roosevelt.

General Miles Secretary Root appeared
and consulted with the President. This
was the first time since Root adminis

the Schley case that the general has had
an extended talk with Roosevelt. He has
severed relations entirely with Root and
has not been in his office since the day
when he handed him his explanation of
the Interview for which he was so-se
verely condemned. The army headquar
ters was completely Ignored by Secretary
Root in connection with his preparation
of a "bill for the reorganization of the
staff, abolishing the office of commanding
general and creating a chief of staff, who
shall be detailed for four years. Secre
tary Root consulted with. all the chiefs of

ly after the formal transfer of sovereign
ty qver the' Danish West Indies to the
United States the Navy Department' may
establish an important coaling station at
St. Thomas. /Whether the navd\ station
will *>e located at this point remains to
be determined. Rear Admirar R. B. Brad
ford Chief of the Bureau of Naval Equip
ment' has been carefully considering tne
matter, and has about reached the con
clusion that it will be better to distribute
the American coal and supply stations
rather thar/ to concentrate tnem at one
point and give an enemy stronger at sea
an opportunity, of blockading dan Juan
harbor. \ ,.
An American squadron could proceed to
St." Thomas and there obtain supplies, or
if St Thomas were Invested It could sail
for San Juan. Besides these two points a
coal pile will be -kept: at Culebra Island,
in the Virgin Passage, .which separates
Porto Rico â¢ and : St. Thomas. - Rear, Ad
miral Bradford does not anticipate diffi
culty - in acquiring , the : ;land at ..St.
Thomas." Denmark now has a reservation
which "will become the property of this
Government and it can be added to by
purchase from private parties.
With coaling stations at San Juan, Cu
lebra and St. Thomas the United States
will dominate the West Indies, a most
important strategical advantage, which
will be I even greater when the isthmian
canal is completed. Greats Britain has a
naval base at Jamaica,' but that point will
be practically surrounded when the Unit
ed States, acquires a Â¦ coaling,' station in
Cuba and : In Colombia. France has Mar
tinique and Guadaloupe,. which are "not
far away from the Danish islands." Great
Britain owns other islands of the Wind
ward group of the Leeward Islands. Cura
cao is the. property of Holland.
. Naval officers .place great stress upon
the excellent strategic position obtained
by the United: States as ; a result of .the
acquisition of the Danish West Indies: At
the- same time it'. Is pointed out that tho
real reason which caused the administra
tion to purchase them was the chance
that" Germany 'might, endeavor to become
their sovereign.' - â¢ Â¦ .".Â¦ . r ~.

"Â¦ He based his opposition . to this : pro
vision on the ground that " the constitu
tion should extend to the islands when

cept the amendment would not prevent
his voting for the treaty, for he believed
In the Monroe doctrine. Â¦
The amendment was rejected without

the provision affecting the" civil rights of

vision 'on the same subject in the Spansh
treaty Â¦ concerning Porto Rico.
, Senator Cullom said that in taking the
islands the United States would assume
no burden of debt, as by the. terms of the
agreement all claims made by Denmark
against the Insular treasury would be
canceled. He placed the total of the
claims at $2,000,000. He also explained the
nature of the obligations the United States
would assume in reference to * the ] St.
Thomas Floating Dock Company and the
.West India and Panama Company, say
ing that on the telegraph franchise it
would be necessary to pay a subsidy ; of
$4000 per year for three or four years and
that In- both cases there was an agree
ment to protect the charters for the time

way in which the State Mineralogist can act.
When a company is found to bÂ»* operating
under false pretenses I will inform the Post
master General of the United States and that
will lead to havinc the objectionable circulars ,
excluded from the mails. ThÂ« Investigator*
who are sent out' will be competent and
thoroughly reliable men, who will report from
personal observation just what the production
of any oil company or mining company is
The misleading circulars that have been re
ceived from abroad cannot be procured from
the otflces of the companies in this State. Tb*
manipulators are too wary for that. But 1
will take means to inform the press of dis
coveries for the protection of tile public and ,
the discouragement of f akern.
There are fake concerns in this State that
are making, all sorts of pretenses in the East
and in Europe to ensnare the unwary. I havÂ«
received letters from bankers In Europe and
elsewhere In which were Inclosed circulars
Issued from this city and other points In Cali
fornia, in which the .pretense of being ablÂ»
to earn enormous annual percentages on In- '
vestments annually is set forth. One banker
in Paris has written to me that he is satis
fied that a concern to which his attention has
been attracted by one of his clients is paying
dividends from its capital and not from tta
earnings. After looking the matter over I am
convinced that he Is about tight in his sup
position. I will not mention. the concern yet,
but I will soon have all the facts about the
property that, is made the basis of the cir
cular in question. This is a mining proposi
tion, but there are oil propositions that arÂ»
proceeding on the same line.
Oil properties and mines will be Investigated
wherever there is any reasonable question con
cerning the representations that they are mak
ing for the purpose of selling stock. I takÂ§
it that the duty of the State Mineralogist re
quires him to do all that can be done to pro
tect the legitimate mining interest* of thÂ»
State. If the public learn that fakes will bt
exposed that -will benefit the solid concerns
that are doing business on the square. But
if the fakers can go on and gull the public
the reputation of the State will be hurt and
all legitimate enterprises seeking capital for
development will be hampered.
I have conferred with the Attorney General
and he has informed me that this Is ths only
There are troubles in store for mining

feuspiclon. This official searcher for truth
left this city for the south yesterday aft
ernoon with data in his pockets and defi
nite instructions from the State Mineraolo
gist to guide him. This much Mr. Aubury

William Robinson and. His Wife Ar
rested for Disturbing the
Peace.
William Robinson and his young Aus
tralian wife continue to l^eep themselves
and their differences , before the public.
Saturday night Policeman Wolters saw a
crowd of about 1000 people in front of the
Hibemia Bank, and on pushing his way
through discovered Mrs. Robinson, .con
siderably under the inuuence of liquor,
striking at her husband and abusing him
shamefully. The couple persisted in air
ing their grievances in the presence of the
officer, and he placed them under arrest
for disturbing the peace. - Mrs. Robinson
spent Saturday night in prison, . but was
released Sunday morning on bail. Robin
son was almost immediately released on
bail by a friend. Â¦ T ]: _ , t
They appeared before Judge Fritz yes
terday, when Robinson explained that he
had been separated from, his wife for
some time and had arrived from Japan
a few days ago. He saw her staggering
along Market street with another woman
and grabbed hold of her with the inten
tion of getting a hack to' send her to her
rooms, on Ellis and Taylor- streets.-, Sne
was so addicted to drink : that he had
made up his mind to get a divorce. The
Judge dismissed both cases..
TÂ».e couple came i into I prominence first
about two years ago, .when Mrs. .Robin
son had her husband, who was then a
printer in Sacramento, arrested' for steal
ing her purse in front of the Grand Hotel.
Considerable sympathy was enlisted for
her at the time by her story. of her hus
band's treatment of her,* but it afterward
turned out that he was the sufferer owing
to her love for liquor. He was brought
before Judge Mogari and the case Was
dismissed. Subsequently; Mrs. Robinson
was arrested for raising a disturbance iri
a house on Ellis street while intoxicated.

CLEVER AMATEUR CHAMPION "WHO WILL ENTER . THE PROFES
SIONAL RANKS TO-NIGHT AND THE HARD - HITTING BOXER
WITH WHOM HE WILL CONTE ST FOR GLORY... .
JIMMY BRITT, the amateur llghtr
Â¦ weight boxer, will prove to-night
whether he is worthy to rise to
the* first ranks of the professional
pugilist or whether he must take a'
back seat. He is to test his mettle against
Toby Irwin, a. tried boxer, in the arena
of the Acme Athletic - Club. He has
trained hard and assures his friends that
he is fit to battle for a kingdom. ; .
On the other hand, Irwin is aware of
the hard contract he has on his hands
and has prepared for- it. He will enter
the arena with a determination of making
Brltfs colors trail in defeat. For three
weeks he has trained and his appearance
proves it. His hand no longer bothers him
and he can punch with all his force with
out danger of injuring that useful mem
ber. They will weigh in at 133 pounds. â¢
Manager Lavigne has prepared seats for
3000 people. The advance sale of tickets
has been extremely large. The interest
taken in the contest has been very great.
On every side is heard a discussion of
the relative merits of the boxers. Each
contestant has his following and they wiU
be there in force to-night to cheer their
men on to victory. â¢Â¦-., .-.â¢ v>
The Olympic Cluo win sena a aeiegauon
of 200 members over to the event. They
â¢will be seated in a body and by, their pres
ence hope to instill Britt with, confidence.
The Sixth-street crowd will also be on.
hand to cheer Britt, their champion. Irwin
comes from the Telegraph Hill district
and he has the backing of every "roclf
roller" in that vicinity.
The men will box fifteen rounds. A
side bet of $500 and a percentage of the
receipts will spur them on. The betting
on the fight is 10 to 8, with Irwin on the
long end. These odds will probably switch
before the men enter the ring and it is
more than likely that the betting will be
even. The winner of this contest will be
matched to fight Jack O'Brien before the
Yosemite Club this month... j
The preliminary battles will be between
Gene Young and Frank George and
Young Gibbs and Jack McDonald. The

Alcazar.
A bright and sparkling comedy, "The
Orient Express," was the attraction at
the Alcazar Theater last night. The house
was 1 crowded and every, one seemed to
thoroughly enjoy the amusing situations
In the play. It is adapted from the Ger
man of "The Orient Reise," by B! men
thai and Kadelburg. authors of "At the
White Horse Tavern."
The hypocritical prohibitionists and
their reprehensible means of securing in-'
criminating information, are held up for
ridicule and the drinkers are shown to
really be in possession of some good qual
ities. The humor of the play consists for
the most part in the antics of a young and
very inexperienced country swain and in'
the exposition of the real sentiments and
characters of. the. temperance clique. Â» â¢

daughter, -Who is driven from home on ac

loon-keeper,-add just the necessary bit of
pathos to â keep 1 the play ~from> being

A crowded house greeted the revival of
Hoyt's "A Temperance Town" at the
Grand Opera-house last nigh tJ The com
pany made the most of a very funny pro
duction and the audience was ', merry
throughout almost the whole ; perform
ance. The typical New England town is
fairly well represented, but- the "charac
ters in several instances appear rather
overdrawn..
"The Ameer" is still popular with the
patrons of the Tivoli. This comic opera,
which was . successfully produced : here
a few years ago by Frank Daniels' com
pany, Is equally well put on by the local
comic opera company. Ferris Hartman
is conceded to bo 'funnier than Daniels.
He produces laughter every minute he is
on the stage.' The music, which was writ
ten by Victor. Herbert, is well sun,? by
the company. Harold Gordon's pleasing
tenor. Is heard . to advantage, and Arthur
Cunningham as : BlackJaWk chief of the
brigands, scores a hit nightly by his fe
rocious appearance and hearty voice

to be produced with new .scenery and ef

that the cast will not be inferior to that

FRESNO, Feb. 17.â President Kearney of the
Halsin Growers' Association has issued a call
for a meeting to be held -on March 3. Direc
tors of the association will then be elected.
Â¦would or would not have, been admitted Into
the combination. To protect their business
end secure their legal rights they were not
obliged to submit' an application for member
ship in such a combination with the possibility
of its rejection or to submit themselves to the
rules and exactions of the association. It Is
clear also that the tendency of the combina
tion was to prevent others from engaging in
the business. No one could become a member
who had not "an established business," and
It is too evident to admit of denial that no one
could establish a business In competition with
the members of the association who possessed
such advantage in deallnz with the manufac
turers. Judgment is affirmed.
To this It is sufficient to eay that It does
not appear that they would have been admitted
to membershio If they had applied. Under
the by-laws they were not eligible, for the
reason that they flld not at all times carry
the requisite amount of etock. and If they had
TKjssessed the necessary amount of stock they
had no assurance that they were "acceptable"
to the members. On the contrary, the fact
that they were not Invited to enter the com
bination when it was formed was a distinct
intimation to them that they were not ac
ceptable. But it Is immaterial whether they
Firm Not Eligible
The association was formed to unite all ac
ceptable dealers encased in the tile, grate and
linir.isl business In b&n Francisco and within
a. radius of two hundred miles and all Ameri
can manufacturers of tiles. It included every
manufacturer of those articles in the United
States and the six firms of local dealers that
were made defendants in the original action. _
Lowry & Daiy were not invited to enter .into"
the combination.
The evidence shows that Lowry & Daly were
notified by manufacturers in Indiana from
Â¦whom they had been purchasing' tiles that un
less Lcwry & Daly became members of the
association the Indiana tlrm would refuse to
Eell them foods. They could not obtain llles
from the local dealers In San Francisco unless
* they paid the list price, which was more than
double that which members of the association
â¢ were required to i>ay.
VTe think that in the light of these facts
the association clearly comes within the pro
hibition of the act of Congress. It has a
direct tendency to restrain trade between the
different States and to create a monopoly. In
principle it would be the same If it were an
association between all the manufacturers of
the United States in that line of goods and a
single dealer In California whereby all other
resident dealers were shut out and all -com
petition between local dealers extinguished.
The tendency of the combination was also
to create a monopoly in the hands of the local
members thereof. The necessary effect of the
combination was to crowd out of business
every local dealer who was not a member
and thereby to create a monopoly In the hands
of those who were. It la argued that Lowry
& Daly might have joined the association had
they chosen to do eo, and that thereby they
might have availed themselves of the privil
eges of membership.
Plaintiffs Not Invited-
Â« I>aley against W. W. Montague & Co.
Â» tnd five other defendants composing the
California membership of the association,
alleging that the association violated the
Sherman anti-trust act. Montague & Co.
end tlie other defendants took an appeal
to the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals. Judge Gilbert .wrote the opinion
for the Court of Appeals, affirming the
judgment of Judge Alorrow In the Circuit
Court and giving extended reasons for
the action or the court. In rendering the
opinion Jucjre Gilbert said:
The writ of error in this case is brought

rendered In an action which the defendants in
error brought aealnst the plaintiffs in error

musicians of skill; .Warren and .Blanch
ard, comedian and singer, are also very
clever. The Blossoms are acrobats of
no mean skill and are a fitting end to a
fine programme. The blograph has some
new and very good scenes.
A HOUSE full of enthusiastic music
lovers stood and cried "bravo" at
Metropolitan Hall last evening.
Mme. Lillian Nordica had just fin
ished singing the call of Brun
hilde to the "Valkyries," her final num
ber in her first recital, and the interest
in her performance that had been con
tinually on the increase found culmina
tion then. The audience was fairly rep
resentative of musical San Francisco.
Society was there In some strength, but
the occasion was not made a society af
fair. Music, pure and simple, was the
attraction, and there was an abundance
of that and of very excellent quality. In
addition to the Branhilde song Nordica
sang seventeen others of varying degrees
of technical difficulty. Such an array of
numbers would" stagger belief unless due
care were devoted to Abe study of the
programme.
The selection and arrangement of the
programme was a work of great skill and
exemplified in a most remarkable way
how a soloist with a tender throat may
sing an entire evening and not be in im
mediate danger of injury therefrom.
There were only fourteen numbers set
down for performance, but four encore
pieces were added by Nordica, who was
a study in amiability as well as in vocal
ism.
First Nordica sang a gentle little song
entitled "The Robin's Song," by McDow
ell, which, served very well to give her
an understanding of the acoustics of the
halL It was of slight range and vocal
requirements, but it was given with such
richness and liquidity of tones and such
sympathetic treatment that it won the
applause of the auditors. r , Another song
of about the same grade followed,, and
three-fourths of the programme were
made up of pieces that were filled with
sentiment and afforded an opportunity,
among other things, for Nordica to prove
herself the heroine of the pianissimo.
It was evidently Nordica' s Idea to give
the greatest amount of melody with the
least outlay of physical force, and this
resulted in- great Joy to the majority of
the audience, who saw the touch of the
artist in everything. There were several
numbers that were playful and sparkling,
like the "Fllles de Cadiz," by Dellbes,
which occasioned a recall. Indeed, Nor
dica had three curtain calls for this num
ber, and probably could have sung the
same number to the satisfaction of the
audience half a dozen times more. To
Illustrate the willingness of Nordica to
please it may be worth mentioning that
she sang one "coon song" as an encore,
a sentimental little bit.
That episode shows the range of the
programme, from "coon song" to the Im
passioned music of Richard Wagner.
Throughout Nordica was at her best. Her
tones were velvety, her vocalization was
clever and she handled the numbers with
clean cut Judgment and abounding senti
ment. E. Romayne Simmons, wno was
announced on the programme in a style
reminiscent of "Casey at the bat," the
line reading "E. Romayne Simmons at
the piano," filled the place of accompan
ist with enough skill to entitle him to re-'
membrance. He was also down for one
solo, Chopin's Polonaise in C sharp minor.
This he played with attention to Â¦ lights
and shades, but with little claim to in
dividuality, his technique, however, . stand
ing him in good stead. He refused an en
core. The second recital of the series will:
take place to-morrow evening and the
closing one on Saturday afternoon at the
same place.
Grace HopXlns acts the part of Anna
Moore quietly and effectively. She and
the squire, Charles Riegrel, do the heavy
work and curtain calls are numerous.
The San Francisco friends of Gracie Craib
Hull gave her a rousing reception last
night. Two years ago- she turned he*
face toward the mysteries and the golden
possibilities of New York and now she
returns a fullfledged and successful sou.

"Oh. well, if I must," retorted Mr.
Roosevelt, but' as he rose his right arm
lunged out with â¢ an upward movement
and the fellow dropped like a slaughtered

venge. Before* Mr. Roosevelt could get
them under control they had kicked tl^

had dragged him out into the snow.Mr.
Koosevelt, " however, finally persuaded
them to bring him in to the fire-
The fellow, whose sway up to this mo

'"No," Insisted Mr. Roosevelt, with
quiet but unmistakable decision; "I'll

President Roosevelt's courage was put
to a sharp test a few winters ago while
he was spending some time- on hl3 stock
ranch in NortH Dakota, says the Phili
delphia Saturday Evening Post. HÂ© was
riding over the range onÂ© raw day in
December when he was overtaken by a
severe snow storm. . Within an hour it
had developed into a . blizzard. At the
first indication of - the severity of the
storm. Mr. Roosevelt had wheeled his
horse and began to make every effort to
get back to headquarters. The fury of
the wind and sleet, however, soon maue
progress impossible. All trails were
obliterated, but fortunately in drifting
before the storm be came to a railroad
track, and. guided by the telegraph
poles, lie kept on until ne arrived at a
prairie saloon.
Having provided for his horse at a sta
ble adjoining the saloon, he made his
way to the barroom, where ho was con
fident he would find a roaring. fire. When
he opened the . door he discovered the
greatest confusion going on. A "bad
man" had been drinking too much and
was working off his uncomfortable exu
berance by shooting holes through mir
rors and making his companions dance
while he shot under their feet.
Half-frozen. Mr. â¢ Roosevelt calmly
seated himself before the redhot stovjs-
Amid the din the outlaw had not lio-"
ticed his arrival, but wfyen he discovered
him he salaamed him with mock cour
tesy and said:
"Well, Mr. Four-Eyes, when did you
arrive?"
' VI Â¦ just now came In," replied Mr.
Roosevelt. "I was caught in the storm
and I've dropped in. here to thaw out"
"You're the stuff," commended the
half-drunken master of ceremonies; "we
like people out here who know enough to
come in out of the wet. And now Ier3

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
The figures need no comment They speak for
themselves and for the city. They present us in a
sad contrast with our sister cities, but they show us
exactly how to deal with the problem of crime. Let
the municipal license for retailing liquor be raised
until it closes many oT the worst slum saloons. Then
with the increased revenue let the police force be in
creased. There is no reason why there should be
any stumbling or fumblfng over a problem whose
solution % is so easy as this.
In the other cities named the revenues derived
from saloon licenses go far toward maintaining the
police force. New York obtains from retail liquor
licenses $7,962,555, and expends for her Police De
partment â¢ Chicago obtains from licenses
$3,197,500, and the cost of her Police Department is
but $3,773,423- Philadelphia gets from saloons
$1,903,000, and maintains her police for $2,894,158.
St. Louis receives $1,075,000 from liquor licenses, and
pays for police protection $1,598,159. Boston derives
$iÂ»477,5O9 from licenses, and her police force costs
her $1,672,842. Baltimore procures an income of
$510,750 from saloons, and maintains her police for
$874,684. What a contrast is presented to those fig
ures by the showing of San Francisco, where, with all
our large ratio of saloons to population, we derive
from municipal retail liquor licenses only $266,532
and pay for police protection $884,461. ' .
The cause of this unAmerican proportion of
saloons to population is the cheapness pi the munici
pal license. The cost of retail liquor licenses in other
large American cities is far higher than the . amount
required here. In New York the license is $800 a
year; in Chicago, $500; in Philadelphia, $1100; in St.
Louis, $500; in Boston, $500 to $2000; in Baltimore,
$250; in San Francisco, $84. Thus while we have
more than double the number of saloons to the popu
lation than any other of these cities, we have a mu
nicipal license that is considerably less than half that
of the lowest license in any of them. Â¦ .
The feasibility of applying such a remedy cannot
be doubted by any one who has given the subject
serious consideration. San Francisco, with a popula
tion of 342,782, has 3173 licensed saloons, or very
nearly a saloon for every 100 inhabitants. This ratio
is so much larger than obtains in any other American
city of note as to appear" something like a monstros
ity. In a comparison with other cities of this coun
try it gives us the appearance of being alien to Amer
ican civilization. Here is the way a recently compiled
record stands of the number of saloons to every
10,000 inhabitants in the principal cities of the
United States: New York, 31; Chicago, 38; Philadel
phia, 13; St. Louis, 27', Boston, 17; Baltimore,
40; San Francisco, 92. It will be seen that no
other of the cities named approximates our ratio of
saloons to population, or even amounts to half of it.
Two factors tend to produce this evil condition.
One is the large number of saloons where criminals
can resort, and the other is the insufficient number
of policemen. The solution of the problem, then,
can be found in the adoption of a policy which will
decrease the number of low class groggeries and at
the same time furnish a revenue for the maintenance
of an increased police force. To apply that policy
nothing more is necessary than to increase the
amount required for retail liquor licenses. It will re
quire no great skill on the part of the city authorities
to so fix the amount of a license to sell liquor that
the result will be the closing up of many if not all the
lower sort of saloons, while at the same time bring
ing to the city from those that remain open a much
larger revenue than is now obtained.
SAN FRANCISCO is,at this time confronted by
a very serious problem arising from the fre- :
quency of crime. Every week adds new in
stances to the lengthening list of assaults, hold-ups,
robberies, burglaries and murders, whose per
petrators escape arrest and remain at large, free "for
the commission of other crimes. The police are ac
tive and vigilant, they work long hours 3#d patrol
long beats, but they are not numerous enough to
safeguard the whole city, so criminals walk abroad in
it with so much impunity that Jthey may well nigh
call it theirs.

"In these days people forget quickly, but I fancy many can remember Lady
Warwick's wonderful girlish beauty in the days when she was still a debutante
and at a tinie when it was more than whispered that she was on the eve' of be
coming the bride of our most studious and serious-minded royal Prince The fact
that this same gentle and kindly royal personage lived to act as best man at
the wedding of Miss Maynard and the then Lord Brooke showed that even in
those days the most charming woman of our time knew how to succeed in doine
what so many women fail to doâ that is, turning a lover into a friend "
Chief among the rivals of the Countess of Y/arwick for the distinction of belns
the reigning beauty of her time were the Marchioness of Londonderry PrWoÂ«
HenryjOf Pless, Mrc. George Keppel, M iss Muriel Wilson and Lily Langtry
; One of that company, afterward recalling the discussion, summed it up thus:
"Of course, the secret of. the Countess' personal popularity is not far to seek
The .fairies who presided over 'Daisy' Maynard's christening endowed her not
only with beauty, but with extraordinary charm of manner, kindness of heart and
the quick wit so often denied to the otherwise fortunate possessor of exceptional

WHO among modern society women will go down to future generations
as having been the loveliest, most interesting feminine personality of her
day? Is a question which was discussed recently In a company of well
known people, cables the London correspondent of 'ne New York

-Â¦It' was finally agreed by all that the Countess of Warwick undoubtedly is; as
one expressed it, "the only great lady who may be said to strike both the popular
Imagination and that of the smaller, more select circle of fliarists and letter-writ
ters who, after all, make history In these matters."

Partial prosperity is no prosperity at all. It must
be general to be real. If it be proposed to use pro
tection only as a 'promoter for manufacturers, the
system will die and the party go out of power. Al
ready it is complained in Washington that this agita
lion,'started by the advocates of .Cuban. free trade, is
a fire that will burn-in all directions unless stopped.
Already sectaries have appeared in the party, and if
supplied "\fcith a motive given to the ; people by .'the
professors of expediency, their propaganda will
spread with a rapidity that will put the result of 1904
In. doubt before the two partisan armies mobilize for
Again, has any one a' reasonable hope that if the
farmers of the' country are disowned, and learn that
their sole duty fs to sweat while they carry protected
manufactures on. their galled backs, protection can
survive? If it be stigmatized as a policy of expe
diency only, and not a principle, does any one hope
for prolonged power for the party which has' pro
fessed it? - :Jih t -
Under the leadership of McKinley the party
taught protection as a principle, a creed that was
from everlasting unto everlasting, not to be de
stroyed by defeat nor overthrown by indifference.
After the defeat that followed the McKinley bill of
1890 not a State convention of the party anywhere
abated its advocacy of protection. It was treated as
a principle deep seated in our system and necessary
to the symmetrical development of the country and
the prosperity of the people. Himself defeated for
re-election to his seat in the House by a nobody
whose name is forgotten, McKinley went among the
people in each succeeding campaign to advocate pro
tection as a principle. In 1896 his reward came, and
in the years following his fidelity was justified. Does
any one believe that if the party 'had abandoned pro
tection when the reverse of 1890 left it so few mem
hets of the House that' their absence from the cham
ber left a quorum there it would have rallied for the
victory of 1896 and repeated it in 1000?
The difficulty inheres in proposing to treat protec
tion not as an economic doctrine founded in the rea
son of things, but as a gaudy^fcxpedient, to be striped
and painted as a sort of theatrical property in cam
paigns and then stripped-and washed off at pleasure.
If the Republican party propose to so treat it, it
should be warned of the result.
In the Ways and Means Committee the tariff had
so narrow an escape last week that protectionists
were thoroughly frightened. Mr. Babcock came
within one vote of reducing the duty on steel and
iron as a rider on the war revenue reduction bill. A
communication from a Republican member of the
Iowa Legislature was exhibited offering to pass a
tariff reduction resolution through "that body. ' By
way of retaliation Babcock was threatened with re
moval of the lumber tariff, because he has large per
sonal investments in lumber, and , this was countered
by a menace that hides would be made free, a demand
of Massachusetts Republicans. The friends of' beet
sugar, if- driven to the wall, declare that, if removal
of protection from the farmer is a good thing, it
should be passed around, and say they will take the
protectionists of the agricultural States, combine with
the Democrats and assault manufactures all along the
line.
Cuban free trade has started inquiry all along the
line, and protection has not been in greater - peril
since 1894. Indeed, its need is greater now than then,
for when the Democrats attacked it they recoiled
from ah extreme position and produced a tariff that
was incapable of description as anything else than
slightly modified protection. Now they are out of
power,: have no responsibility, and are willing to
join the discontent of the agricultural class, caused by
the proposition to disown it as a beneficiary of pro
tection, and cut the whole system to the marrow.
The plea that without free trade with us Cuba's
sugar crop this year must be harvested at a loss has

If ex-Supervisor Reed would invest his talents in a
crusade for a proper system of public accounting he
would be approaching municipal ownership from the
right side. "
In the case of municipal plants the people are the
owners of the works and administer them through
their agents, the city officials. Under private owner
ship the stockholders are the owners and the corpora
tion is their agent and trustee. This trustee is com
pelled by law to account for every mill of income and
outgo, and every stockholder has access to the ac
counts. His stock is his property. But when did a
municipal owner, ever feel that sense i of ownership
or attempt to enforce an equally exact accounting?
Never to our knowledge, and for that reason the
people are deprived of any means of proper compari
son".
have enabled the beginning and prosecution of the
work. These bond issues and their interest should
be added to all statements of the comparative cost of
water under municipal and private ownership. But
the enthusiastic proponents of municipal paternalism
go to the water-rate alone and present that as the
total cost of the supply. Of course Kansas City and
Philadelphia by their rates contribute to this show
ing, when the fact in their case is that the actual cost
is millions in excess of the rate. ."
Philadelphia is issuing twelve or fifteen millions in
bonds to effect long neglected sanitation of her'pub
lic water-supply, when an addition to the rate would
The net conclusion from the exhibit is that if re
pairs and extensions had been made as their need
appeared, the rate must have been greatly in excess
of that charged. But they were not made, and now
require a bond issue of several millions*.
Kansas City is just now adding to the list of prob
lems which arise under municipal ownership. She
has long owned her water supply. -.The supply is
constant and the system presents fine opportunity for
study. It appears now that repairs, extensions and
needed betterments have been neglectecf, until a point
is reached where they can be put off no longer and
must be made either by issuing bonds or -raising the
water rate. The existing rate is denounced as ex
orbitant, and the city papers bristle with statistics.
From these it appears that for the last seven years
.the income from the water works has been $2,545,
368, and the interest, cost and sinking fund have
amounted to $2,471,413, leaving only $173,955' accumu
lated income with which to make repairs and neces
sary additions that will cost millions. The great per
centage of cost of administration to income is _no
ticeable. In^some years the expense of administra
tion exceeds income, and fluctuates up and down, the
fluctuation apparently following the changes in poli
tical administration of the city.
We have given many examples of the occurrence of
this and other problems in cities under municipal
ownership. As a rule the trouble is municipal waste
and such a failure in' the system of accounting as to
make impossible ascertainment of the cost of the
water supply. The people are owners and ratepayers
and taxpayers. They partly pay for water in the di
rect rate and partly by taxation. The direct rate is
known; the indirect, by taxation, is not known.
Mr. Reed shows a shortage of water, but The Call
had long preceded him in that. It is highly probable
that if San Francisco had owned her water supply
from the beginning her water system would now be
exactly what the Spring Valley system is. It was the
first, most obvious and ready source, and any en
gineer, in public or private employ, would have re
sorted to it. It is also true that the supply would
be just as short under public as it is under private
ownership, and the problem that confronts the Spring
Valley would be a municipal problem. .
The liveliest impulse received by municipal owner
6hipin this city is the speech of ex-Supervisor Reed
on Sunday evening at the Academy of Sciences. But
a careful reading of the full report made in The Call
impresses one with its lack of information.
The store of facts bearing upon municipal waste
is daily increasing. This waste is an indefinite, un
known quantity, because public accounting conceals
rather than reveals public accounts. There has been
exposed in Chicago an instance of waste in that city,
by "which a half million has been lost to the taxpay T
ers of the West Side, and special taxes have been
collected for years as interest and sinking fund on a
bond issue that was iong ago canceled. Proper ac
counting and proper publicity would render such a
thing impossible. But when" the Illinois Legislature
passed a law to reform public accounting the Gov
ernor vetoed it. â¢;Â¦
Professor Parsons of Boston has drawn the enthu
siasm of audiences in favor of municipal ownership,
but his own State furnishes examples Â¦; which should
deter other communities from embarking in it until
there is a reform in public accounting.
MUNICIPAL paternalism is having its innings
just now nT interesting discussions that illu
minate every branch of the subject except
one. That one, however, seems to be the determin
ing factor in the matter. No one discusses the re
form of public accounting to the end that a compari
son may be made between the cost of public utilities
under municipal and private ownership. It is no
torious that everything else done by municipal gov
ernment enormously exceeds the cost of parallel pri
vate work, and as a Tule is of poorer quality. No
one explains by what sorcery this rule is to be
changed when municipalities embark in the adminis
tration of general business. . â¢ ,
SHE IS THE REIGNING
BEAUTY IN ENGLAND
A more important consequence of the change
would be. the lengthening of the term of Congress.
At present Congress has to perform nearly all of its
work in what is known as. "the long term." The clos
ing session,; which is cut short by March 4, hardly
affords time for the passage of routine bills. Six ad
ditional weeks of work would therefore be beneficial
in' many ways. That consideration will probably in
duce the country to give the amendment a cordial
support. Indeed, it is quite possible that it may be
acted upon with ;such promptness that it will go into
effect during the -present administration, j and the next
President will have the pleasure of an April inaugura
tion.
days of March. are generally unpleasant in that local
ity. March, it seems, has a habit of coming in like

been frequently spoiled by blustering storms. A'
postponement to April. would- render such* occasions
much more pleasant to visitors and would enable the
national capital to |rrange for grand spectacular in
augurals with^the assurance that they would not be
marred by winds or storms. '

The appraisement of the Lake Merced lands
is based upon the value which they would have
if their use for the production of water were
abandoned.
It has not been possible for the City Engi
neer to ascertain the ownership by the Spring
Valley Water Works ip the properties and
water rights now in use above Nlles, particu
larly in the Sunoi Valley, for the development
of water which is being sent to this city
through the Alameda - pipe and the Belmont
pumps. . Expenditures by the water company
on this system have, therefore, been omitted
from this valuation, to be added as may be
.found necessary during the progress of the
inquiries now being made by the Board of
Supervisors, as a basis for fixing water rates.
The old works from the Nlles dam acrosc
Alameda Creek to Niles are not essential to
the system as now in use." It may, however,
be difficult to separate them from the water
rights which they helped to perfect. They
would not now be constructed as a necessary
part of the system, but. being constructed they
can be made, for a time at. least, to serve a
useful .purpose in supplying water to riparian
owners on Alameda Creek at and below Niles.
It has been thought proper to appraise them
at one-half of the estimated cost of duplicate.
Water Rights Above Niles.
The salient points of the report follow:
Lobjjs Creek pump has not been Included in
the appraisement, neither the Lobos Creek
lands. These properties have been in use for
some months during 1901 in supplying water,
but the source is undesirable and use of water
from it has again been discontinued.
It has been learned that certain works on
the Alameda shore, heretofore supposed to be
the property of the Spring Valley Water
Works, really appertain to another corpora
tion, from which the Spring Valley Company
derives the water furnished to the city from
that source. The information upon this con
dition possessed by this board is incomplete
and needs to be supplemented by testimony
which the Board of Supervisors can obtain from
the representaives of the company. For this
reason, certain items in the valuation of last
year are omitted from the accompanying re
port awaiting fuller information.
The ngures submitted do not include a valu
ation of the meters, nor of property on hand,
tools, horses, coal, etc.. because no specific in
formation relating thereto has yet been fur
nished by the water company. Their value re
mains to be added to the figures now sub
mitted. Neither ha3 anything been added for
gates set in 1901 on pipes of the city-distribut
ing system, because no information has been
received showing what' additions have been,
made during the year.

T^HE quartermaster captain of the
transport Meade was delivered a
gold brick' at Nagasaki by the
firm that supplied the transport
with coal, and as a result Uncle
Sam's big passenger boat had to call at
Honolulu for a supply of fuel that would
burn. The Meade arrived here yesterday
a week late, the imitation coal taken
aboard at Nagasaki being accountable for
the delay. The Meade brought sixty
three cabin passengers, fifty-seven sick,
wounded and convalescent, thirteen in
sane, two prisoners and 410 discharged
soldiers. She brought from Honolulu ten
stowaways, whose presence ~on board
caused a delay of several hours in quar
antine. The sick were transferred to the
Presidio, the soldiers were lodged at the
-detention- camp on .,Angel Island and Â»the
cabin passengers were brought ashore at
a late hour on the tug Slocum.
The Meade left Manila January 16 and
Nagasaki January 23. At Nagasaki she
took aboard a supply of "coal." As it
turned out, only a small percentage of
what filled the bunkers would really hum,
and what did burn was over 20 per tent
waste. On February 5, when in latitude
30.37 north, longitude 165.7 west, Captain
Willson decided to branch off in the di
rection of Honolulu and there lay in a
supply of real coal. The island port was
reached February 8, and on February 9,
with 700 tons of good ccal in the bunkers,
the transport headed for San Francisco.
She encountered a seasonable share of
stormy weather, but on the whole had a
pleasant trip. She sighted the Warren
yesterday morning.. The cabin passen

and Successf til Dandruff Treatment.
Have you dandruff? TJjen you Â¦ have
a contagious parasite disease, unpleas-
ant, unhealthy and one that will event-
ually lead to baldness. To cure it you
must destroy the parasite . that eats at
the root of the haJr. The only preparation
for, destroying these germs is . Newbro's
Herpicide. Charles Klein of Laramle,
Wyo., says: "Herpicide allayed the ittrfi-
ing, cured the dandruff and stopped my
hair's falling out: and it is bringing a new
crop of hair." Herpicide is free from
grease or dangerous # drugs, and makes
hair glossy and, soft as silk. One bottle
will convince you of ltd merits.

NEW YORK, Feb. 17.â To-day's severe
eni.wBtonn lessened the attendance at the
6tock -Xxcl-^nse and made the stay short ot
thcee brokers who did attend. The conse
â¢au.-aoe was a "dull - and uninteresting market
of no fixed tendency. Only a few stocks
showed dealings of any importance and the
price movement In these was inclined to vary.
A number of usually inactive stocks made some
profcrees upward. The undertone was firm and
while prices did not hold always at the best
the lever of prices did not get below (Saturday.
There nas an active speculation In Metropol
itan Street Railway, but the opinion, of thÂ«
new plan remained about as unfixed as since
its promulgation. Sugar advanced on account
of the riiÂ»e in the price of refined susrar. and
tbe ccciinuÂ«4 hope that the duty on Cuban
eugars will "-. be remitted by Congress. 'lhe
urgent buying ot raw copper in London and
the sharp advance > in 'the price resulted in
buying of Amalgamated Copper stocks here
'i'hi re < was some movement in the stocks of
<lifi erent'.jsteel companies, apparently In con
nection with the annual meeting of tbe United
States Steel Corporation, but the movement
of the etocks themselves was narrow and deal-
Ings were not on a very large scale, consider
ing the enormous volume of the capital. The
rai.road list, outside of some minor stocks,. was
sluggish and neglected.' Tbe continued paucity
of the grain movement and the obstruction of
tra: fie; by ; storms foreshadows a repetition . of
the decreases of- first week gross earnings for
the eccond .week in February. Although con
fidence has been professed in Wall street that
the Supreme Court will ' hand down a. decision
next' Monday favorable to the Northern Securi
ties Company, as the time approaches for the
court to .convene ' there is a disposition to hold
eff speculative operations until the .case is
decided. The money market showed some de
gree of firmness, although not quotably
changed. The late rise in Sugar to 3 points
over Saturday and the recovery to the 'top' in
Amalgamated Copper sustained the â¢ market,
which - was otherwise Inclined to yield In suc
cessive epots. The closing was irregular.
Bonfls were steady. Total sales, par value.

CHICAGO, Feb. 17. â There was a little wave
of bull feeling at the opening in wheat to-day.
Cables were firm and world's statistics were
bullish. There was some fair buying by com
mission houses early and the bullish sentiment
carried over from Saturday . with advances In
corn and oats helped prices upward. , May
opened higher to a 6hade lower at 7Svj
@7S%c and speedily advanced to 79c. Almost
every bit of available news was bullish. There
was a French cable claiming probable Injury
to the ..wheat crop from the; hard 'winter;
world's . shipments fell off- nearly Â¦: 2,000,000
bushels from weekly requirements and the visi
ble supply fell off 1,100,000 bushels. Dullness
in trading, however, and the fact that out
eiders were not in the .market worked against
prices. When -79c was reached for May, com
mission houses sold and other grains lost -early
gains. The' bears who had been short early
and who had covered, took courage and sold
short again, though not to a great extent.
May slid off to i&AWWiZ and closed weak,
3Â»<&%c down, at 78%c, *
Corn had a good upturn early, but prices
did not hold when late selling eet in. May
closed weak, %Â®%c lower, at 61%c. Â¦
Oats had a. nervous opening, advancing early
on commission house buying. There seems to
be a tense feeling over the. concentrated May
situation. Shorts were very uneasy and cov
ered. When wheat and ' corn turned bearish
this pit lost much Â¦ of its 'Â¦early gain. Â¦ May
closed firm. U@hLc higher, at 43%@44c.
Provisions were dull and easier on a heavy
run of hogs ..at the yards. May r pork closed
10c lower; lard 6@7%c lower and ribs 7%c
lower. -

WHEAT â Liverpool futures were firmer.
Paris was unchanged.. A French cable report
ed the weather too cold for this time of the
year and said that if it continued considerable
damage would result. Broomhall cabled se
vere frost and some enow In Central Russia,
but continued mild weather in the southwest
provinces. The world's shipments .for the week
were aa follows, in quarters : Russian 111 -
000; Danubian,. 37,000; Argentina, ou.wA); in
olan, 00,000; Australian. Stt.UOU. The American
visible supply decreased 1,064,000 busneis. > / . Â»
Chicago opened ttrm but quiet. Increased
Northwestern receipts partially offset the.bul
lish foreign advices. Some French^buying lent
color to me adverse crop "reports from- France.
One hundred thousand bushus were worked for
export. There was increased activity with good
â¢local buying at one time, but weakness at St.
Louis on account of larger receipts and favora
ble ; domestic crop reports . checked the Â¦ ad
vance. ; ' . . _: ; -
This market was higher, both on and off call,
and It was reported that the shippers would
pay $1 11% for something choice. Freights con
tinue to weaken, and a snip has been taken for
Europe at 25s. This decline In freights lends
additional strength to the market. â¢ â¢ .

; Â¦ The Exchange held Its first session at the
new nour of .'10:30 a. m. yesterday, but be
yond making, a quotation at 18c for Standard
Eggs 'did not alter, prices. It is not an incor
porated body like the other commercial ex
changes of the city, instead of merely an as
sociation of dealers, as heretofore. - -
"The firmness In Butter and Eggs continues,
and the demand is sharp enough to consume
even 'the current large arrivals without .diffi
culty." _: The exhaustion of supplies of packed
goods " has helped Butter . by ; attracting all the
medium-priced trade to the second and lower
grade goods, g There is also some shipping de
mand, but the main strength of the market is
due to the lQcal " inquiry- '-/Stocks are very slen
der, and some dealers are practically cleaned
up. Â¦Â¦ , . : - : r '
- There is no change in the Egg situation, the
market "being characterized by large receipts,
which are quickly absorbed by a keen demand
for local and shipping account, and there Is no
accumulation "of stock. The old quotations for
Cheese still rule.

Captain Seymour has in his possession
the coat that was worn by Frank Woods,

liceman Robinson was shot and killed b>
him afca his companions. The coat was
found in a vacant lot adjoining the resi

etreet, by some boys.
The back of the coat is pierced with two
of the bullets which the dying officer
fired at Woods. The location of the bul
let holes in the coat -and the two wounds
from which .Woods is suffering show con
clusively that the garment belonged to
him. The lot where the coat was found

.Fletcher went out in the early forenoon
with three other men in his nineteen-foot
yawl, the Willie. When the storm came
up In the afternoon tlie crew put about
to return "to Tiburon. The -heavy seÂ»
running in Raccoon Straits made it im
pdssible to go through, so they pulled
toward Angel Island. While the waves
were dashing high over the frail craft
Fletcher", sighted a small boat ahead.
Seemingly there was a man reclining in
the rear. Fletcher steered' toward the'lit
tle craft and finally overhauled her.- He
found that It had no occupant. Making
the small boat fast to his yawl, he again
made for 1 the shore and -late at night
reached a ha ven under the lee of Attgel
Island. He could not land, but was com
pelled to stay on the yawl all night. ;
Early this morning the Willie put back
to Tiburon and .investigation -of the con
tents of ' the small Â¦ boat followed. ; : J n a
canvas sack were found an oil suit, a" pair
of No. 7 shoes, blue woolen hose, a greeiy
blanket, a black sweater, . three plaid
handkerchiefs, a 'pair -of gray trousers, a
red shirt, an astrakancap, a white flan
nel cap, a black- memorandum book, an
undershirt and a scapula with the initial
"II" embroidered on one side. On none
of the garments, were there any identify
ing marks, but the trousers buttons has
the inscription, '.'Bon . Marche, Paris.'*
None of- the. clothing 1 was: of. American
style, resembling that generally worn by
Frenchmen. . .
A photograph of a man, clean shaven,
about SO years of age. in full military uni
,form, was also found. .The photograph
er's name on the back was "Paul, Mayne,'
France." Whether this photograph : la
Â¦that of the missing man is a question,
J In the bottom of the boat were a few
very large clam shells, obtainable only
along the Southern California coast. The
meat had been taken out evidently quite
recently,. leading to the conclusion that
the occupant of the. boat . had subsisted
onthe clams. . . '.
Fletcher believes that when he first saw
the boat buffeted by the waves there was
a man in it and that he must have been
thrown out and drowned. before the Willie
could come alongside. Although the beach
has been ' watcheu to-day no body has
come ashore. . .... _ . ; , -
Some believe the unfortunate man was
the missing: sailor from the French bark
Alice, recently - in , quarantine, and 'that
when he escaped he. hid in the hills ot
Marin County . until ,; Saturday ; or Sunday
and then attempted to row to Ban;Fran
cisco. â¢

A CONCERT THURSDAY NIGHT.
â¢Â¦Â¦..SACRAMENTO, Feb. lT.-IIugh Duffey.
residing at 1323 H street, was shot and
perhaps fatally wdUnaed by a burglar
this evening. Duffey found a man acting
in a suspicious manner In the backyard
of a neighbor named Bartell and went
over and seized the intruder. Two young
men named Sextdh and Eldrjdge assisted
Duffey. . As they were trying to search
the . man the sash of a window opening
into the backyard was. raised by a burglar
who was inside and who fired upon DufÂ«
fey.. Duffey fell with.-a bullet in his sido
and the. man in the yard broKe away from
Sexton and. Bldrldge and Â¦ escaped. The
burglar . in . the house jumped from the
window^ and fled, but- lost nis hat. This
may be useful in establishing hi3 Identity.
Miss Alary Duffey, daughter of the
burglar's victim, was tvilh her father
when, he went to the Bartell house. In
describing the tragedy she said:
"When we got over to Mr. Â¦ Bartell' a
house my father Â¦ told the two boys that
went with us to stand atthe back corner
of the house and- to catch any one wha
came out. Then. he. went up and rang the
door bell, and as he did so, 1 saw a man
with a lighted candle in his hana , cotnu
to the window, part the lace curtains and
look but. I. Then he blew out the candle
and disappeared.
Â¦ "My fatner. came down -from the porch,
and as he did so a young man ran out
of /the house, and my father caught him
and asked 'What" were you doing in that
house?' .The young man eeemed to be
badly frightened, for his voice shook as
he said: '1 was not -doing anything: 1
wasn't In the house.' .My lather replied:
'Yes. you were, for I saw you there.'
Â¦"The two boys that were with us then
came up and took hold of the fellow and
my father started to search his pockets.
He took out of one pocket a piece of soap
and asked : 'Where Is that candle you
had^ VThe fellow said: T did have a
piece of candle,', and he reached his hand
Into one of his pockets and drew out a
piece of. candle and some matches. . '
"Just as he did this a Window in Mr.
Bartell's house was thrown open Â¦ and a.
man. leaned out: 'Throw up your hands,*
he ordered.-. Then I heard a shot, my
father staggered back against the, fence
and the fellow who was being held by
the Â¦ boys struck one of them and broke
loose and. both of the robbers ran away."
' -After : Duffey was shot- he was helped
Â¦ into - his .residence and physicians were
called to his assistance. Dr. Charles Pink
ham, who was the first to arrive, found
that the bullet had entered the body to
tho right of the breastbone on a level with
the. sixth rib j and i must have eone di
rectly through the body, passing between
the ninth- and tenth ribs, as It can be
easily felt beneath the skin in. the back.
; Officers were sent out in. all directions.

River bridge north of the city the officer
in charge was informed that a bareheaded
man had crossed the bridge a few min

mandates. The matter was set ; for 10
o'clock, but Mr. Daniels did not appear,
because he didn't choose to, as he has dis
covered that the law holds no terrors for
him. The Court Commissioner was as
complacent as the circumstances would
permit and reset the hearing until to-mor
row mornine at 10:30 o'clock.
Now to-morrow morning at 10:S0 o'clock
Dr. George C. Pardee was to have ap
peared to have his deposition taken, the
attorneys having stipulated that when
they first began taking- depositions a week
ago. In view of the recent disclosures
In the case of Editor Daniels, he Is in no-
Wise obligated to appear before the Com
missioner. He could, if he wanted to,
stand on his rights and bid defiance to
the Court Commissioner without fear of
incarceration for a term in the County
Ja!l. Notwithstanding this state of af
fairs and his perfect safety with regard
to the Court Commissioner, Dr. Parde.e is
said to have made up his mind that he
will be present at 10:30 o'clock. The Court
Commissioner said this rooming that he
had been given to understand that Dr.
Pardee would be there on time and not
make much fuss about the kind and num
ber cf questions they asked him.
D. Edward Collins stayed away from
Notary Public Steele's office again this
morning, so that his depositions could not
be taken. This was on the advice of his at
torneys that the service of the papers was
not regular. They gave him the same ad
vice as on last Saturday, -when he refused
to appear. The notary public, at the re
quest of the attorneys, reset the hearing
for next Saturday at 10 o'clock. By that
time some uncertainties about the case
will have been settled. One of these Is the
Â«4uestion of the powers of the Court Com
missioner and the other Is the disposition
of Dalton's demurrer to the complaint.
The demurrer is to be argued next Friday
before Judge Ogden.
Attorneys Snook and Church. Editor
Daniels' legal representatives, want the
Court Commissioner to Qle a bond so that
in oase lie is held liable for the arrest and
imprisonment of their client they can hold
him responsible for his acts. They tiled a
request with Judge Ogden to-day asking
him to rt-quire Mr. Babcock to file a suf
ficient bond. Judge Ogden took the mat
ter undf>r consideration until he can con
sult with the other members of the bench.

Enquirer, did not go on as per schedule
this morning before the Court Commis

There was little ado about the Colllns-
Pardee-Dalton-Dauiels controversy to

to test the powers of the Court Commis

The Rev. Mr. Drahms declared in the
course of his remarks that California, was
behind other States in this matter, and in
speaking of lack of system In reformatory
or prison discipline drew attention to a
state of affairs in San Quentin Prison,
when four j r ears ago 69 .per. cent of the

serted that he had known boys of 12

CLERGYMEN LOCK
HORNS WITH ELKS
Storm Follows the Dedi
cation of San Jose's
Library.
Pastors Protest Against In
scription Placed Upon the
Cornerstone.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Feb. 17.-The laying of the
cornerstone of the new Carnegie library
by the Elks of this city has aroused the
ire of the Pastors* Union. The chcoslng
of Sunday as the day for. the ceremonies
brought forth the first objection, but the
placing of the Elks*, inscription on the
stone has added fuel to the flames. The
ministers carried their right Into the
Council Chamber to-night, where their
protests were vain, and it is rumored they
â¢will now appeal to Andrew Carnegie.
A block of granite constituted the cor
nerstone. F. A. Curtlss, the contractor,
on the beginning of work this morning,
grabbed a crowbar arid dislodged the cor
nerstone. He notified Architect Binder
that the stone would not go into the
building until It was ordered by the Coun
cil. He declared the plans arÂ»l specifica
tions called for a sandstone block, and
he would not allow granite to be used In
stead, as it might violate his contract.
It is said that the ministers brought in
fluence to bear on Curtlss* bondsmen, who
feared trouble If granite were used. Â¦
' To-night a committee from tho Pastors'
Union, headed by Rev. Mr. Meredith,
went before the Council. Before it was
heard, a resolution was adopted author
izing the placing of the granite corner
stone. When' Rev. Mr. Meredith obtained
the floor he said he was sorry the pas
tors had not been invited to speak be
fore the resolution was adopted. He then
presented resolutions adopted by the Pas
tors' Union. These resolutions protest
against the "mutilation and misuse of
Mr.; Carnegie's gift" by placing thereon
a. stone bearing the Inscription "Placed by
Ban Jose Lodge No. 522, B. P. O. E.. at
the request of the Mayor and Common
Council." They continue:
Â¦ That we call upon the Mayor and Common
Council to order the removal of the (tone;
that we invoke all civic orders and educational
Institutions and good citizens throughout our
city to aid. in securing the removal of an of
fense which reflects upon the culture and san
ity of our community. Should it bÂ» deemed
proper to lay another, stone, we request that
the programme be broad enough to admit of
representation Â»of all classes In the . exercises
and that some other day than Sunday be
chosen.
It was further declared that the Elks',
inscription on the stone was offensive to
refined tastes and i for the purpose of ad
vertising a special interest.
The resolutions were filed, but no notice
of them was taken.

Properly Selected Food of Great Im-
portance.
Loss of memory is a sure sign that the
bofly is not taking up proper elements
from the food. Then is the time io feed
especially selected foods or the person
may become demented.
A mother writes about her son and it is
Interesting: "My son, Albert, now 25 years
old and principal of the - â High School,
graduated at the Kansas University and
'.a a post graduate of the Columbia, Mo.,
University. . "
"When he began teaching about a year
ago he had Just completed his education
and was badly broken down in health.
He had only about two months* vacation
and spent it at Excelsior Springs, but
when be returned there was no improve-
ment.
"WÂ« thought be would get better after
he began his work, but Instead of Imprdv- \
Ing, he became more weak and nervou3, |
and finally rorgetfui In the schoolroom.
He tried different physicians and every-
thing be could hear of and at last gave vp
school and cam* home, after putting a
teacher in his place.
"I cooked every delicacy I cdiild thiiilt
of for him, but be became very thin and
we were greatly worried about hint. One
day a neighbor sent over a box of Grape-
Nuts. He caught eight of the package
and after reading the statement of what
the food was Intended for became much
interested and began using it.
"He liked it, and at the end of a week
vras very much strengthened and im-
proved. We were encouraged. He stuck
to Grape-Nuts and in five weeks was
back In the schoolroom.
"He Is now teaching the second term in
Ihe same place, has recovered entirely
and gained wonderfully in flesh. He now
weighs 165 pounds and is an expert foot-
ball player.
"My daughter, Georgia, eight years old,
teas a weak little girl until, after we
round what effect Grape-Nuts had on Al-
bert, we put her on the food and now she
Â» exceptionally stout and healthy. Wo
urteh to thank the Company for the great
&elp the food has been to us. ff This lady

CANCER
'Â¦ Sufferers from this honibla Tnalady
nearly always inherit itâ sot necessarily
from the parents, but may be from soms
remote ancestor, for. Cancer cf tea rnss
through several generations. This deadly
poison may lay dormant in the blood for
years, or until you reach middle life, then
the first little sore or ulcer makes its ap-
pearance-â or a swollen gland in tie
breast, or some other part of the body,
gives the first warning. â¢
To cure Cancer thoroughly and perscua-
nently all the poisonous virus mast be
eliminated from the bloodâ every vestige
of it driven out. ThiÂ« S. S. S. does, and
is the only medicine that cas reach deep-
seated, obstinate blood troubles like this-.
When all the poison has been forced out
of the system the Cancer heals, and the
disease never returns.
Cancer begins often in a small way, as the
following letter from Mrs. Shirer shows:

WASHINGTON, Feb: 17.â After an:, ex
tended ; debate | the Senate to-day passed
the bill establishing . a: permanent Census
Bureau. . The ' discussion related . princi
pally to the collection and publication by
the director of the, census of v statistics
respecting the production: of cotton. " Al
lison vigorously opposed the - provision,
maintaining that" the cotton -statistics
gathered -by the Department 'of Agricul
ture were complete and accurate,- and that
no necessity existed, for their duplication.
Despite his opposition, the provision was
inserted in-. the bill. - /-;- .

CENSUS BUREAU
BILL IS PASSED
â¢-PrQceeding,- he said' that his idea was to
unite examples and actual practice in the
American; control of the islands and he
believed that the result must be the up
lifting^ and the education of the pebpl^
to 'a point which would put them on a
plane far above that which is at present
occupied. ' â¢ v .
did not 'originally favor the acquisition of
the Philppines and I was sorry at the time tha*
we got them, but now that we are there -I see
no; other way than to go on anfl-carrjr cm
the Rlan that I have euggestud. j .-. -â .
- I may be a Mark Tapley in this matter but
If I did not believe that we would bring? these
people out regardless of the fact that the feat
we propose is to an extent unprecedented if I
did not -believe we would aucced in doing what
we are undertaking to do, I should resign im
mediately, and come home. :Â¦*:.' . -.-:--
Replying to Senator Rawlins, Governor
Taft advanced the idea . that on account
of. the fact that the lrtliplnos have for 30u
years been under, the influence of the
Christian Â¦ religion they, would prove to be
different from other Malay races, and
that in time, under the influence of Amer
ican education, .the people might become
capable - of self-government. : He did not
consider the case as parallel with that
presented " in 1 India.^ He thought all the
difficulties of race and climate might be
overcome, but held that it would take
time and require much- patience in the
matter 0/ training on our part. He an
ticipated some trouble on account of un
due or illegal exploitation of the islands
and corruption . in - case of continued
American occupation, but he would not
on account of this danger turn the islands
back to the fate of an oligarchy so ioag
as' there is a probability of success, as
there is In this case. He continued:
Time and Patience Required.
Governor Taft thought' there should be
a declaration on the part of the United
States of 'its intention to hold the islands
indefinitely, with the understanding that
when "-tney- are" suitable for such condition
they may be given a quasi-independence.
Such a pronouncement ' by ' this country
would.be welcomed by many and. would
do much good.^Many of. the common peo
ple do not, he said, { know the difference
Detween^ independence, and dependence,
and many of the better-informed have noe
followed the agitation : for independence
to Its last analysis. Some of the agitators
seem,, he said, to count upon a protector
ate by the United States. If the govern
ment of the Islands should now be turned
over to the therAselvea there
would be nothing less than an absolute
oligarchy, ' they having no idea of -civil
government. ;
Fears the Work of Agitators.
I In repiy to questions, . Governor Taft
said he agreed with' General Funston t/iat
ttie establishment of a popular' | assem
blage would give opportunity to- i dema
gogues to stir up tne people, but that he
aid not include in this designation all.pei
sons who 1 , are opposed to American con
trol. '.There are, he said, many, men In
the islands who conscientiously .'oppose
the domination ' ot the' United States. To
grant i independence Â¦ would, he thought,
nave* the erfect of . consigning .v the ao per
cent of uneducated people in tne islands to
the same servile position they held under
Spanish rule." ' - ..
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17. â Governor
Taft, in his testimony before the Senate
Committee, on Â¦: the- 1 FblUPPines 'to-day,
stated more succinctly than he has/here
tofore done his theory, which he said is

In concluding r the head consul thanked

The order, he said, 'is patriotic, for
when the President called for volunteers
insurance companies , gave notice that
they would cancel the policies of those
who engaged in that war, whereas the
Woodmen announced by unanimous vote
and'every camp gave notice , that no neigh
bor would be allowed to become delin
quent because of joining . the army to
fight for Old Glory. He also said that
the Woodmen is tha- only fraternal or
ganization - that places a monument to
mark the last resting-place of each,.de
ceased neighbor of woodcraft.
The head' consul was introduced, and
after thanking the Mayor said that when
the Woodmen numbered 10,000 he felt very
proud, but that now when, after an ex
istence of eleven years, It numbered 70,
000 in the Pacific jurisdiction, which , Is
composed \ of â¢ nine States," the aggregate
population of which is less than that of
the State of Ohio, he could not find words
to express his feelings. The order, he
said, pays $15 a minute each day in the
year, to widows and orphans, and since
its existence It had paid more than $3,000,
000 Â¦ to beneficiaries of members who had
passed away. He spoke of the rise of
the order" and-, then said that in the
broadness, of its principles it had ad
mitted women to the benefits of the or
der and established the Women of Wood
craft, which has 28,000 members in this
jurisdiction.

DETROIT. Mich.-, Feb.- 17.â C. R. Mains,
â¢who was arrested to-day at San Fran
cisco by the United States Marshal, was
the central figure in a sensation which
etirred the whole State about two years
ago. Mains, at that time, was one of the
most prominent attorneys in Battle Creek,
Mich., and was arrested on a charge of
conspiracy to kill.'
This conspiracy, it was alleged at the
time, was againEt the life of S. F. Hurl
but, an attorney of that place, who had
brought charges of perjury against
Mains. It was alleged that Mains hired a
man known as "Mollie" Maguire to sand
bag Hurlbut and bring him in an insen
eible condition to a place where Mains
â¢was waiting, and where he expected to
revive Hurlbut and by threats of death
compel him to sign a statement exoner
ating Mains from the charge of perjury.
"Mollie" Maguire was arrested and con
fessed the part he was to have taken in
the alleged conspiracy. Mains was ac
quitted of the conspiracy charge, but aft
erward was disbarred by the Michigan
Supreme Court.
Â¦ interest was aroused in police cir
cles yesterday by the visit to the city of
H. C. Davey, manager of the Century
Mining Company of San Jose, who report
ed that about four weeks ago a man
named William Bennett applied to him
for a ' position and was given work. He
resembles I in a marked manner the de
scription of the man who murdered Nora
Fuller. His brother has been In Davey's
employ for several years and is highly
esteemed. Davey does not think that this
Bennett is the man for whom the San
Francisco police, are searching, but. In
tends to give the Sheriff of Santa Clara
County an opportunity to investigate the
matter. Â¦

lice the manager of the Morton Special
Delivery declined to allow an examination
of the express receipts for January, but
on a request went over them for a few
days in the early part of- the month. He
said he found several deliveries of lug
gage to the Graystone, but none that was
signed by Bennett. St. Amant is positive
that such a name was signed to one of his
receipts from the Graystone and it is
thought that police were given an oppor
tunity to examine the handwriting and
found the result so important as to war
rant them in returning to the quest for
the murderer among the January lodgers
at the Graystone. As the hotel is across
the street from the Popular restaurant,
where the murderer took his meals, it
would seem a probable place for him to
room. . ... â¢ *
Unfortunately for the success of this
endeavor, the Graystone is not greatly in
sistent upon their, guests registering and
the clerks are not bubbling over with in
formation about the people who room
there. A search of the register failed to
establish that room 66 had been occupied
during January by anyone until the 22d.
Endeavor Not Successful.
OneÂ© more the police are turning to the
Graystone Hotel on Geary street and its
guests, registered and unregistered, with
the hope that something may be found
there that will reveal the identity of the
slayer of Nora Fuller. This renewed in
vestigation was set 'on foot as a result
of a story told by Louis St. Amant, a
driver for Â»the Morton Special Delivery
Company, who says that about six weeks
ago he delivered to room 66, in the Grey
stone, a trunk which was- receipted for
by a man who gave the name of C. B.
Bennett. The trunk was brought from the
ferry, and delivered about 3 o'clock in
the afternoon. It was taken in the'ele
vator to the office floor, Where the clerk
told St. Amant to deliver it to the room
mentioned. The occupant of the room was
at home and held a short conversation
with the expressman.
The affair made no particular impres
sion on St. Amant at 'the time, but after
the body of Nora Fuller had been found
in the vacant house on Butter street he
recalled the similarity of names between
the supposed murderer and the occupant
of room 66 at the Graystone. The descrip
tion I of the man who arranged to meet
Nora Fuller at the Popular Restaurant
coincided with the appearance of the man
who receipted for the trunk, so far as the
expressman could remember. Captain
Seymour heard of the story and sent for
the expressman yesterday morning. St.
Amant told all he could recall of the in
cident and detectives were at once de
tailed to ascertain whatever they could of
the man .who occupied room 66 at the
Graystone between the 1st and 15th of
January. . \ ', :>;;.,' â¢-:'. \!;;i
Seek Greystone Guest.
The suspect has not been taken into
custody, but the surveillance over him is
so strict as to amount practically to an
arrest. iMothing turtner will be done by
the .Placerville autnonues unless the sus
pect - should maKe. an attempt to escape
until the case has been thoroughly inves
tigated by the police department of this
city.
The location of the suspect and the
strict espionage by the Placerville officers
were unaertaken at the request of Chief
of Police Wittman. When the informa
tion waa received that the man had been
located and could be controlled both the
Chief and Captain Seymour were notice
ably elated, . but would not discuss tne
matter. From Placerville it was learned
that while no information could be ob
tained regarding the identity of the sus
pect the evidence against him was strong,
but entirely circumstantial so far as
known there.
What Is considered the most Important
development in the Fuller murder case
since the body -was discovered in the Sut
ter street house was the information re
ceived by the police department yesterday
afternoon from Placerville, a mining camp
iii El Dorado County, that a suspect
whose connection with the case seems to
be almost definitely shown from circum
stantial evidence had been located there.
Who or what this man is cannot be
learned. The police in San Francisco ab
solutely refuse to give out any informa
tion on 'the subject, and the anerirf of
Dorado County is equally reticent under
instructions from Chief Wittman.
\Y From the allegations of the complaint herein
It appears that the Justices of the Peace have
in writing, nominated and recommended a
Justices' clerk, but that the Supervisors have
failed, as yet. to appoint him. ftct that
the Legislature has provided by â¢ section S3
Code of ; Civil Procedure, that the
Justices "or. a majority of them"
Ehall , make 8uch nomination and , , recom
mendation, to "â¢ my mind; Â¦, vests the < choice >; of
the ; officer in them, but requires > his coramls-
This beinz true, Mr. Williams at the time
of the suspension mentioned in the complalrt
herein was not holding the office or "chier
clerk" of the Justices' court, for no such of
fice existed, but was, by virtue o/ the pro
visions , of section 86 of the Code of Civil Pro
cedure, holding the office of "Justices' clerk "'
to which office he had on the written nomina
tion and recommendation'of the Justices of the
Peace been appointed in 1899 by the Board of
Supervisors. Not holding the office of "chief
clerk," etc., he was never suspended from thÂ»
office which he actually held, but did, as the
complaint herein alleges, resign his oijace. â¢ .
Upon such reeisnatlon there Â¦ became a - va
cancy ir. the office created by section 86, Code
of Civil Procedure, which it. became the duty
of the Supervisors to fill, on the written 1 nom
ination and recommendation of the Justices
or a majority of them. Where - no date is
fixed for the commencement of a term of office j
even though a. definite time for the holding of
it be fixed, a new officer can and must be ap
pointed by thi power in: which is vested- the
filling of the officeâ not the filling of a va
cancy â and the officer so appointed ia ap
pointed for the term designated in the statute
1. e.. in this case for the full two years from
the date of his appointment. â¢ - .

The State sues for its del inauent taxes in
this court. It has more than . a mere local
Jurisdiction, and in my opinion, it being a part
of the State Judicial system, is in no sense a
"municipal affair," therefore, the charter sec
tion which calls for no bonds and in several
ways conflicts with this section of the code,
is void and must give way to the higher law
the constitution. â¢
In No Sense a "Municipal Affair."
Section 1 of chapter 7 of the charter of this
city and county, in my ODlnicn, under the au
thorities just cited. , imposes a duty upon the
Justices of the Peace and a responsibility
which could only be imposed by law, and as
the Supreme Court holds a charter not to be
a law, such section in so far at least as it re
quires the Justices of the Peace to appoint a
clerk Is void. Further than this, a clerk of a
court, being but the ministerial officer of the
court itsey. is a part of the .' court, -and the
Legislature by' law having established that
part, of the Justices' Court of this city ami
county, has created an office which is part
of the State judicial system and which, is not
a municipal affair. By a general law of the
State, section . 86 of the Code of Civil Pro
cedure, it is provided that the Supervisors
"shall appoint a Justices' clerk on the written
nomination and recommendation of said Jus
tices, or a majority of them, who shall hold
office for two years and until his euccessor is
In like manner appointed' and qualified. Said
Justices' clerk shall take the constitutional
oath of office and give bond in the sum of
$ 10.000 for the faithful discharge of the duties
of his office, in the same manner as is or may
be recuired of other officers of such city and
county," etc.
Under the decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of People vs. Toal. 85 Cal., 333. af
firmed in the case of- Minor, 121 Cal., 2S4 it
has been distinctly held that even inferior
courts not by name mentioned in the consti
tution, with solely local jurisdiction, could not
be established by charter, nor could duties or
responsibilities be imposed by charter upon the
Judzes thereof.
(See also 84 Cal., 655; 69 Cal., 519: 73 Cal
507. and 8 Cal.. 85.)
Clearly, to my mind, officers so named and
designated, cannot be said to be but a "muni
cipal affair," whatever might be said of other
inferior courts established in cities or towns
by legislative enactment. Even if a "City Jus
tice," a "Recorder's Court" or a "Mayor's
Court," with Jurisdiction limited, might be con
sidered a "municipal affair," certainly a Jus
tice of the Peace, such as is named in the con
stitution, cannot. And the Supreme Court of
this State has held that even a "City Jus
tice," being- one of the inferior courts, not
named, but alluded to in the constitution is a
imrt of the State judicial system. . (People vs
Cobb, 133 Cal.) (See also McGraw vs. Mayor
etc, 55 Cal., 611, and People vs. Ransom, 50
From this it 'Is clear that Justices of the
Peace are a part of the Judicial system of the
State and have vested in them â co nemine by
the constitution itself, their share in , the Judi
cial power of the State, not of a mere city or
county, and are, by the constitution, included
in the judicial department of the State Gov
ernment. . .
Part of State Judicial System.
The Judicial power of this State, under the
constitution of the State, is vested in "the
Senate, sitting as a court of impeachment, in
a Supreme Court, Superior Courts, Justices of
the Peace and such inferior courts as ' the Leg
islature may establish in any Incorporated
city, or town, or city and county." (Art. VI,
sec. 1. Constitution of California.)
The legislative department of the State gov
ernment has the power to pass laws. The ex
ecutive department may veto them and is called
upon to carry out such laws as have been en
acted. The judicial department, in Its sphere
is also supreme, in interpreting and applying
these laws and compelling obedience to them
where they are found to be valid and In ac
cordance and not in conflict with the constitu
tion.
The situation is a novel one and calls for an
opinion one way or the other, which can only
be founded upon deductions from other cases,
there being no case, directly in point, cited by
either side. In making 1 such deductions I have
used my best judgment and have reached a con
clusion which I believe to be right. If I am
wrong 1 there exists, in my opinion, a speedy
way in which the matter can be presented
to the tribunal which sits to correct my errors,
if I make any, which I hope. In the interests
of Justice and orderly government, counsel will
at once avail themselves of.
The reasons upon which I base my conclusion
are these:
Under our system of Government, both Fed
eral and State, there are three distinct and in
dependent branches, each supreme in its own
sphere, which together form the Government in
its entirety. With either gone, the Government
is incomplete. The fundamental characteristics
of the American national Government â as well
as that of each of the several States which
compose that Government â is its separation of
the legislative, executive and judicial depart
ments. This separation is the merit which the
Philadelphia Convention chiefly sought to at
tain, and which has always been regarded as
most completely secured by the constitution.
The demurrer to the complaint and the order
to show cause why a permanent injunction
should not Issue herein, having been submitted
to the court for decision and the matters and
the law having been fully considered, I have
concluded to sustain the demurrer and to re
fuse the injunction asked for. This conclusion
has not been reached without some doubt, but
it is the result of my best judgment on a mat
ter which â so far as any authorities cited by
either counsel is concerned â is without any
precedent to be followed.
The decision is rendered on a demurrer
in the case of J. J. Quinn vs. Harry
Baehr, Auditor, to restrain the latter
from auditing Fredrick's salary warrant.
The court sustains the demurrer and says:
Â«-- Judge Cook does not decide, however,
whether or not the Mayor had a right to
make the temporary, appointment. /The
court is of the opinion that upon Wil
liams' resignation it became the duty of
the Supervisors to fill the vacancy upon
the nomination of the Justices. Fredrick,
Judge Cook believes, may legally fill the
position until the Supervisors "do their
duty" and elect a man nominated by the
Justices. Joseph Windrow is at present
In nomination.
Superior Judge Cook decided yesterday
that the Auditor could not be restrained
from auditing the salary, demand of Powel
Fredrick, Justices' Court Clerk, who was
appointed to fill the position vacated by.
Ed Williams, at first deposed, then re
signed.

The oleomargarine bill that was passed
by Congress last week will probably effect
the remedy that has been sought. By the
terms of that bill a tax of 10 cents is
placed upon each pound of oleomargarine
that is manufactured and colored in imi
tation of butter. This makes an increase
in the, cost cf production of 8 cents per
pound, the old rate of tax having: been
only 2 cents per pound. Altogether so
Secretary Saylor of the State Dairy Bu
reau figures, trie cost of oleomargarine
laid down at Santa Monica -will be so
large that there i3 an excellent cnance
that California dairy products will be
found not too high priced for the veterans
by a sympathetic Government, and the
farmers of the State will reap a corre
sponding advantage by. having the sol
diers' tables to supply.
A thorn that - has rankled for some
years in the mlnd3 of the Grand A'rmy
men of this State may now be extracted.
There is at Santa Monica a home for Un
cle Sam's, veteran soldiers. Heroes who
fought for the preservation of the repub
lic are there lodged for the remainder of
their days. While they have many com
forts it has always provoked the Ire of
their former comrades in arms that they
ihould be singled out from all the inhabit
ants of the State of California to be com
pelled â¢ to use, in place of the fresh dairy
article. the greasy substance known as
oleomargarine.
The Standard Rothschild Oil Company
was another member of the four-billion
concern. The card of W. Scott Gifford
gives his address as London, Paris, New
York and Chicago.
Bennett informed Chief Postofflce In
epector Robert R. Munro of the attempt
to extort his gold by the painless process
and Inspector Munro caused Mains' ar
rest. The prisoner resided with his fam
ily at S132 Twenty-fifth street and came
hither from the .East a few months ago.
His ball was fixed at $1500, which he was
unable to furnish.
C R. Mains, who has been represent
ing himself as the agent for a "four-bil
lion syndicate," was arrested yesterday
by Deputy United States Marshal Morse
on vÂ£. charge of using the malls with in
tent to defraud. Mains addressed several
type-written letters to Dr. Charles B.
Bennett at Wausseon, Ohio, offering him
Â¦ the presidency of the syndicate in return
for 53000 cash to be invested by Dr. Ben
nett in syndicate non-assessable stock,
guaranteed to pay 8 per cent per annum.
Bennett consulted his banker and his
banker informed him that Mains was
handing him a gold brick.
The circulars issued by Mains name
the following aggregations of bloated
bondholders as forming the syndicate:
Combined Bankers, Paris InX-estors, Con
solidated Roads, United Capitalists of
London. Stock and Bond Brokers. Oil
