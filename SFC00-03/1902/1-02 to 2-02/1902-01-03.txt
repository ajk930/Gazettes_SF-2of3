According to W. S. Porter, who; is" the'
general manager of the Associated Oil
Company, the present capacity of the
companies that have been merged in. the
Associated Oil Company is 4,000,000 barrels
per annum. These few general-state
ments indicate the importance and: jnag
,nitude of the new business enterprise^
which opens its real transactions with' the

ditions among the oil , producers jj of Call"

year â¢with an event of greaUslg
nificance in relation to the material - in
terests of this State. No move of equal
importance has ever been made in Cali
fornia with so little of show. The an
nouncement of actual operations will be a
surprise to many oil men who are" not yet
in the company. Many of the largest oil
producing companies in California have
now definitely disappeared in their indi
vidual capacity, having been taken over,
lands, wells and property of all kinds, ; by
the new organization, and with this trans
fer go contracts for the delivery of 3,000,
000 barrels per annum" for a Jong term.
Fully 50 per cent of the productive oil
territory north of Tehachapi is represent
ed at this time. A large additional per
centage will come in when the questions
concerning titles are determined finally.
Stockholders in " many companies* have
authorized the sale of their properties, to
the Associated OH Company in addition
to those already merged and taken over.

outcome was an agreement to finally dis

consequently accumulated, prices have
fallen again and. there has been general

months. ,
'Very likely, it was .well that the Los

Pierson, C. A. Grow, E. J. de Sabla Jr.
and John Martin has purchased all the
capital stock of the Xorth Pacific Coast
Railroad and will enter into possession
next Monday.
At the conclusion of the deal yesterday
the officers of the syndicate gave out the
following- announcement to the press:
The ferry-boats that run between San
Francisco and Sausaiito will all be over
hauled. Their time-tables will be changed
bo that the ferry-bcats will be dispatched
to suit the convenience * of the general
public instead of the general public hav

Â¦which is changed in the summer months
to one nearly as bad.
With this gigantic deal consummated,
Marln County will start In on a new era
of prosperity. The syndicate will improve
the property by making the roadbed
standard gauge from Sausalito to San
Anselmo, double track throughout; from
Mill Valley Junction to Mill Valley - and
from San Anselmo to San Rafael. Elec

screechy old engines and broken-down
trains will be replaced by smooth-running
electric cars.

James B. Stetson will resign as presi
dent of the road and George H. Falrchild,
the well-known railroad man, will step in
as general manager. Mr. Fairchild was
et one time an engineer in the employ of
the Pacific Mall Steamship Company, 'and
he was many years the engineer of the

now being operated between Kevada City
and Grass Valley. He has resigned his
last position to take up his new duties
with the North Pacific Coast Railroad.
The deal was closed late- yesterday aft

Probable Appointees.
; The new Mayor is sure to have a warm
time over the distribution of the spoils of
victory. There are forty applicants for
every, place at his disposal. He is bound
to make thirty-nine political enemies
every time that he signs a commission.
He has been considering the . advisability
of appointing a full set of Commissioners
for every board and giving the appointees
a chance. to go into court and make legal
battle for possession of the goods. On re
flection he decided to test his power to
displace . existing Commissioners by ap
pointing a brand-new Board of Education.
It was reasoned that Mayor Phelan was
particularly unfortunate in his selection
of Educational Commissioners and that
the public would regard . nearly any
change in the board as a change for the
better. It was considered further that the
members of the board by their own con
duct in office had Intensified the public
displeasure which was provoked when
Mayor Phelan commissioned them to look
after common school affairs. The Mayor
elect is sure that the public would com
mend him for making a clean sweep of
this board, hence it would not be surpris
ing If the test of bis power should be
made In this direction.
There Is no question as to the new
Mayor's right to name eight Commission
ers \ and political gossip is to the 'effect
that he will appoint as follows:'
Fire Commissioner â Thomas Boyle.
Board of Works Commissioner â No selection.
- Polica Commissioner 1 â A. * Gruenberg.
Election Commissioner â A. Bouvler.
Park Commissioner â John Stanton.
Civil Service Commissionerâ No selection.
Â¦ School Director â A. Roncovterl.
For the place that will become vacant
on the Board of Health- no one, it is said,
has been decided upon, although Dr. John
F. Dillon, late candidate for Coroner, can
have it if he desires.
It is common gossip at the City Hall
that ' Mr. Keane - of A. Ruef's law office
will succeed Charles Fay as Mayor's sec-
Supervisors' Committees.
The burden of appointing the standing
committees of the Board of Supervisors
will not be imposed on the new Mayor.
The Supervisors themselves have grace
fully resolved -to lighten his work in this
particular line. To-night they will hold a
final conference and exchange views. The
chairmanships will be allotted as follows:
Street Committee â Peter J. Curtis.
Police â Dr. Charles Boston.
Financeâ H. TJ. Brandenstein.

**^ The Incoming Mayor had made hl|" cal
culations to step in oh Monday, January
6,. at high,, noon. It may please him to
signify ' noon 'of Wednesday, January S,
as an acceptable time. If Mr. Schmitz
were a Democrat of the Jacksonian school
he would , rejoice at the opportunity of
taking office on January 8, as that day is
the anniversary "of General Jackson'3
great victory over the British at New
Orleans. The old Democratic campaign
refrain was:
"Where was Andrew Jackson then?
He was up to his neck in mud and blood.
Fighting the battles of his countrymen.
Notwithstanding the opinion of the City
and County Attorney, the offlcers^elect of
the Union Labor party, headed by Mayor
Schmitz, will demand their offices on
Monday. Under decisions of the Supreme
Court this seems to be the only safe plan
for them to pursue, as that court has hehl
in a number of cases that where an offi
cial falls to demand his office at the time
at which he rightfully believes it to be
due, then he forfeits his claim to it. It
is â¢ not the desire for two extra days of
office that is actuating them In this move-
â¢ The City Attorney decides that- the offi
cers chosen at the last municipal elec
tion will not go into office until the be
ginning' of January 8. In other words, the
present officers who were inducted into
office January 8, 1900, were elected to
serve two years and that their term of
service will not expire until the last hour
of January 7, 1902. Coming down to a
fine point, Mayor-elect Eugene E. Schmitz
is not entitled to succeed Mayor Phelaa
until 12:01 a. m. .Wednesday, January S.
It is presumed that the Incoming Mayor
will cheerfully await the dawn before dis
turbing Mayor Phelan, but the latter
nay find it more convenient to surrender
the works shortly after midnight than to
rise early after dawn.

MARYSVILLE, Jan. 2!â Samuel Enochs,
who was accidentally shot, while hunting
deer in the foothills nine miles east of
Wheatland, in Yuba County, on. New
Year's day, died at his. home at that
place this morning. Details of the acci
dent show it to have been another case of
a hunter mistaking a friend for the
hunted - animal.
Enochs was one -of a party that went
deer hunting Wednesday morning. Jeff
Thomas started up a deer and was fol
lowing it He saw. something moving in
the brush in front of him, and, thinking
it was the deer, raised his rifle and flred.
The ball struck Enochs In the left thigh.
An operation was performed as soon as
possible, but the wounded man was too
weak from loss of blood jto survive the
shock. He leaves a wife and two grown
daughters. On New Year's day, Just a
year ago, Enoch's brother was killed at

The examination of Laf e Harris was re
sumed after the disposal of Colburn. At :
torney Raker for the defense asked the
witness a question and was told by Boyd
of the prosecution that it was. none of his
business. Boyd was then asked by Raker
if he considered that a proper objection.
This resulted in a brief row, and then the
witness testified that the first thing he did
when he came to Alturas was to go and
see Assistant Attorney- General Post, at
torney for the people.
ALTURAS, r Jan.; 2.â In- the Superior

took place in Trowbridge Hall and Levan

was in one of these that he heard one of

would be hanged the first clear night. .
. Colburn has been detained in the County
Jail as a witness in this case for the past
six, months, on an. affidavit of District At

Deputy Constable Brown, the defendant
now on trial, told him to keep trying to
get a search warrant to search the prem

. SAX JOSE, Jan. 2.â There was a sensa
tional bit of gun play in the postofflce
corridor shortly before neon to-day. The
personnel of the drama were a tall
woman, with a revolver and. a determined
gaze, and a larÂ§;e man, who soon started
on a rapid gait in the opposite direction
irom the woman with the gun.
The woman was Mrs. Irene Frost and
the man her husband, Erwin Frost, a
private detective. Trouble has been brew
ing for many years. in the Frost house
hold. Two months ago. Mrs. Frost filed
her second suit for divorce. A few days
ago the husband forced entrance to her
room, for which : offense he is under ar

Mrs. Frost gives as an explanation for
the gun play that she went to the office
for her mail. Procuring it she was pass

to snatch it from her and she used this
means of defending- . herself. The people
in the ofiice fled almost as swiftly as the

to keep his mouth shut ; that what De
fendant Jim Brown had told him was true
â¢ and that he should keep quiet about it,
especially before women.- - -
It was on this testimony that Brown
. was indicted by the Grand Jury. Two
/ writs of habeas corpus in the.Modoc Su
perior Court an<l two writs in the Su
- preme Court, asking for his release, have
been denied. He now claims that his tes

1 from.Dours, a detective, employed during
: the June session of the Grand Jury; by
Governor Gage. ;
*'. In the first part of June, on application
for a wrii. of habeas corpus, the witness
swore to a petition in the Superior Court,
In which he charged Superior Judge Har
rington and" -District Attorney Bonner
with having offered â¢ him : money -for his
testimony. On presentation of this peti
tion by Attorneys Raker and Harris Su
perior Judge Harrington ' imposed - a - fine
on the attorneys of 550 each, -with the al
ternative . of five day3 in jail, for the
charge in the petition. Harris went to' jail
and Raker left for San Francisco the day
after to present the matter to the Su
preme Court and secure a writ ofprohi
tlon. - The Supreme Court issued a, com
mission to take the testimony and Col
burn testified that his charge against
Bonner was unintentional, but that Har
rington had offered him $5 a day for his
testimony. if he would remain in Alturas.
It is probable . that Colburn will continue
to refuse -to testify In this case. Â¦
Sensational testimony is expected soon

she followed the mob out of curiosity last
May. and saw the lynching.
â¢ PROMINENT FIGURES IN THE
LOOKOUT LYNCHING CASE ON
TRIAL AT ALTURAS.
These competitive examinations are to be
conducted by a paid examination board of
three or five competent persons not Identified
Â¦with the school department and never serving
In succession; selected, two by the Superin
tendent, two by the Board of Education, and
these to select a fifth; applicants to be known
to the examiner by number, and all papers
written by applicants to become public docu
ments and subject to review for at least three
months. Lists of all applicants arranged - in
the order of their rank, who attained the re
quired minimum, are to be furnished the
Board of Education, from which teachers may
be selected in the order of their , standin-
These examinations should be held at lealt
annually and new lists thus prepared. â¢"""â¢
The foregoing plan I submit excludes con
eideration of any financial, political, social or
friendly influence that an applicant may pos
sess. It will bar politics from the operation
of our schools in their educational functions
end thus remove an objectionable influence
from teachers, pupils and educational adminis
tration. Â¦
It will relieve school officials of the Im
portunities of applicants and their friends and
<-nablÂ« them to devote much -more time to their
duties; for it is safe to assert that nearly one
third of the time of a school official who haj<
patronage to distribute is consumed i n en'er
tainlng requests for place. Not only will this
time be 6Â»ved to the school official " but his
mind, undisturbed by consideration of appii
cations for place, can be devoted with its un
impaired strength to the task of studying
school conditions and problems. ' -
We rourt Â«Jo one thins or the other in regard
to the teaching service of the public schools
We may let politicians of high and low decree'
neighbors and friends, push people, good bad
or Indifferent, Into - teachers' positions â¢'â¢ and
Tilth this result; that there- will be no progress
In scholarship or general culture. Â¦ nor anv
growth In character, disciplinary power or
teaching ability. . Or we may guard admissions
making the standard high and eliminate any
considerations of "Influence"; train beginners
promote on the baEis of merit; dismiss those
who fail in the test for capacity; destroy
sycophancy: encourage Independent - manhood
Â»nd : womanhood : Instill professional pride: ln
epire progress whose benign . influence will be
felt In the home; give enduring support to good
citizenship â better life to the commonwealth. . Â¦
Appointment of Judges.
I submit, however, that the original selec
tion should be left to the judgment of no single
board or school official. . The responsibility is
too great. In a town or large city a Super
intendent's time would be completely consumed
by the reception of aprllcants and their friends,
the consideration of their credentials and by
the investigation of their -qualifications. The
Superintendent or school official does not live
who, unbiased by considerations of political,
social or other influences, can select the best
qualified persons from all those who apply.. To
declare that from all who make application a
board can select a limited number, and those
the best, is to arrogate and to assume om
niscience, an attribute which is ascribed to
the Deity alone. Again to declare that one
is not and will not be influenced by considera
tions of friendship in the selection of teachers
from those who possess a parity of qualification
is to declare oneself an ingrate.
Therefore I repeat that I would delegate the
Â£rave responsibility of originally selecting
teachers to the Judgment of no one school
official or to a Board of Education. The Gov
ernment of our republic inaugurated civil ser
vice reform In the selection of Its subordinate
employes. The system is being extended into
the government of our great municipalities.
Why not adopt it in the great business of se
lecting teachers In our cities and counties? I
FUggest this as a plan:
For the purpose of their employment let the
teacher* of a School Department of any city
or county be divided into three . sections.
First, the secondary or high school section:
second, the elementary or grammar and pri
mary section; third, the section of special
teachers. Ail applicants in any section must
be possessed of valid certificates entitling them
to teach in that section (it is here assumed
that the possession of a teacher's certificate
1* a gnarantee, under the law, of good char
acter), be subjected to competitive examina
tions whose scope shall be broad, embracing
the history, science and art of education and
subjects required to be taught in that section
of school to which they apply for admission
All candidates who fail to reach a minimum
percentage in any one subject or minimum
average in all are to be rejected. This will
insure good scholarship, the prime essential of
a teacher; and the epectacle of one unable to
eolve- mathematical problems, answer gram
matical, historical, geographical or scientific
ttuestions within the range of their teaching
work will be absent." â¢
Difficulty of Selection.
Notwithstanding the- fact that it centralizes
power, experience has resulted In making the
third method â election by the board of edu
cation on recommendation by the superintend
ent â a rule of conduct in many cities of the
United States, and it can be stated that this
method is steadily gaining favor. The main
reason assigned is that the average member of
a board of education has neither time, oppor
tunity nor ability to make such Investigations
or apply such tests as are necessary to de
termine the fitness of teachers. The superin
tendent on the other hand is, by the nature of
his office, 'and generally by his training, bet
ter qualified for this function. Again it fixes
responsibility. If the schools are not pro
gressive and thorough the blame can be imme
diately charged to a superintendent, providing
he be vested with power and unhampered in
1U exercise.
Schools erist not to please contractors and
place-hunters, but to supply instruction; to
brine into activity and to' direct in the proper
mental, moral and physical avenues the dor
mant and developing" powers or the child. The
readiness to accept almost anything that passes
under the name of instruction has done much
to retard the development of schools. Yet It
IB gratifying to note the closer discrimination
with which people are observing what is done.
\Vhen they consider the diCering values of in
struction, they come to the all-important prob
lem of the organization and supervision of the
teaching- force. Fine buildings, complete text
books and . perfectly equipped laboratories are
great aids in education, but without good
teachers they yield unsatisfactory results. Tht:
teacher is the principal factor in a successful
school. . . .
Kow should the teacher be selected and ap
pointed? Three methods are ordinarily em
ployed. First, orgins.1 selection .by a board
of education; second, election by a board, .of
education on recommended selections by its
committee appointed for that purpose; third,
election by a board of education on recommend
ed selections made by ; the superintendent of
schools. Much can be said in favor of ,aud
against each system, for each possesses its ad
vantages and disadvantages.'
Plan for a Civil Service.
PACIFIC GROVE, Jan. 2â Work is pil
ing up to an almost alarming , extent as
the present session of the California
Teachers' Association draws to a close.
To-day was certainly the busiest as well
As. .the most important of the # convention.
All the big guns and many of the lesser
ones as well were heard during the day,
the subjects throughout being highly
technical. As a result brains to-night are
near to bursting with tne amount of in
formation they- have been called upon to
absorb since 9 o'clock this morning.
. After .the addresses by President An
drews of Nebraska University and Presi
dent Jordan of Stanford probably the
most important and certainly the most in
teresting to Calitornians was the discus
sion of the two topicsâ "The Selection and
Appointment of Teachers" and "The Pres
ent Duty of the State Touching the
Training of Its Kiementary and Secon
dary Teachers."
The first of these was opened by Dr.
Andrews, who spoke in general terms, ad
vocating the making ot a list of eligible
teachers by a system of competitive ex
aminations that should be absolutely fair
and honest, and after that a careful se
lection from this list of the best person
for the particular place. He also spoke
strongly in favor of placing such appoint
ive power in the hands ot one person of
undoubted qualifications, rather than in
those of a committee or" board of'educa
tion, in order to definitely fix the respon
sibility.
Benjamin Ide Wheeler, who closed the
argument, -expressed himself emphatically
in favor of this method. Two well-known
San Franciscans spoke upon this subject â
City Superintendent R. H. Webster and
C. W. Mark of the San Francisco Board
of Education. Superintendent Webster

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 2.â Hopes are again
raised by the news that rain is. falling In
the north 'and" by the south wind and
overcast ; sky in Â¦ â¢ Southern California.
Should rain not come, it would prove a
great disappointment to ranchers. The
ground Is almost baked by long lack of
rain and only by constant cultivating is
it kept in a condition as favorable as pos
sible. Indications : point to rain before
night.- ;. ;I .*:^--. s -:?â¢'- y :V.';
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 2.â There is no in
dlcatipn to-day that the rainstorm pass
ing over the State to the north of the
mountains will reach Southern California.
The day is warm and although. the sky
is somewhat clouded it does not premise
the much : needed rainfall. The wind ia
exceedingly light from the Â¦â¢ southwest.
The country is extremely dry, especially
in the highland districts, and a downpour
would bring relief to farmers in all sec
.tions. .; ; ..'.>.."';' Â¦;"-.'.".".*" ;
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 2.â Those who
have been anxiously waiting for weeks
for a fall of rain brightened up this morn
ing as they thought their' hopes were
about toÂ»be realized. The weather was
cloudy and the rain started â¢ to drizzle.
The fall, however, was not sufficient to
wet the surface of the earth and although
the weather is still threatening there 13
but little hope of a continued storm.-
MILTON, Jan. 2.â One-half an Inch of
rain fell here last night. This rairi was
very timely and will be of great benefit
to ranchers and stock raisers. An unus
ually large acreage of grain has been put
in and, the prospects for this season of
the year are very flattering.
FRESNO, Jan. 2.â A. warm rain began
falling before midnight and " ceased at
dawn. The ' precipitation was .03 inch.
The' barometer has, however,' risen rap
idly and the sky is clearing. Indications
are for more rain in a few. days. . The
shower did great service in two respects,
viz.â by softening the soil for plowing and
preventing grain already sown from rot
ting in the ground. The sprinkle will also
start pasturage, which was suffering for
lack of moisture. The shower breaks the
longest winter drouth in the county rec
ords, extending over the entire month of
December. The rainfall for the season is
2.14 inches. . .
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2.â There was a
heavy fall of rain throughout the Sacra
mento Valley, in the foothills and tha
mountains last night. There had been
several days of severe north wind in the
valley and the farmers had been com
plaining that rain was badly needed. The
precipitation of last night will do a vast
; amount "of good in the ; fields, orchards
: and vineyards, especially on thÂ« high
; lands. In the valley the average precipi
tation was -.50 of an Inch. No rain ha3
fallen to-day, but the sky is cloudy. - Â¦ â¢ 'Â¦
' SAN; JOSE, Jan. 2.â There were several
light showers during ' the night and the
weather still threatens rain, -.which is
much needed to start the grass and aid
the orchardist and the farmer. <â¢
STOCKTON, Jan. 2.â The acreage put to
grain in. San Joaquin County this season
will be extremely large. Not for years
has the weather been sd good for plowing
and seeding. There has been no interrup
tion of either, and to this is due the im
i mense acreage of grain.
I Already most of the seeding has been
completed. Although there was no press
ing need of rain, the rain of last night
will result in enormous benefit to ~ the,
grain that is already in the ground, as.
Â¦if will start the seed. Reports show that
it has been general over the county. Con
ditions are such that should 'there be a
reasonable precipitation the "balance of
the season San Joaquin County crops will
be enormous in all lines, especially as re
gards grain. - '? '
SAN JOSE, Jan. 2.â A ghastly discovery
was made by section men on the "harrow
gauge, railroad between this city and
Campbell shortly after 7 o'clock this
morning. In a smoldering pile of ashes
was found the charred remains of a hu
man body burned beyond all possible
recognition. Surrounding 1 the corpse were
the ashes of a small pile of railroad ties,
which had been left along the track. " The
fire had nearly burned Itself out when di3-s
covered and nothing but the blackened
trunk and charred head of the man re
main to tell the story.
The Coroner and Sheriff were notified
and an investigation seemed to show that
some unknown man, perhaps a tramp, had
taken this method of transit to the be
yond. A revolver, found near by, had one
cartridge indented. Frank Mendoza heard
a shot flred about 1 o'clock and earlier
saw a tramp sleeping at the spot- The fire
and gun were .doubtless the double means
for suicide.
Upon returning to their rooms Luck"
hardt found that the documents of -their
estate and other letters and papers were
gone and he redoubled the search, calling
on the detective department for assist
ance. While these papers are not nego
tiable, their loss may involve title to the
Mexican estate. Luckhardt said to-night:
"I am convinced that she was induced
t>y some one to leave home. Ruby would
not have thought of taking the papers,
but my theory is that she told some man
of her interest in the papers, and that all
of the papers were In my. room and that
he persuaded hereto take them. -
."I have , telegraphed to my sisters in
Alameda and San Francisco and received
replies stating that they have heard noth
ing of the girl. She could not travel far
without assistance, for I am quite sure
she had but 70 cents in money."
Luckhardt began an immediate search
for his sister. He traced her to a dress
making establishment, where she re
mained from 11 until 12:30 o'clock, when
she went out, telling the dressmaker that
there was an important engagement she
must keep at 1:30 o'clock. There all trace
of the girl is lost.
Last Tuesday morning Miss Luckhardt
left home, an expressman coming for her
trunk. When Luckhardt returned Tues
day evening *he found a short note ad
dressed to him, in which his sister stated
that she would no longer be a burden on
him and as she was convinced that he did
not like her she would go away and try
to find employment and make her -own
living. She told- her landlady that she
was going for a visit, of two or three
weeks with friends in this city and from
there would probably go : to San Fran
cisco, where she has a sister. Another
sister lives in Alameda: :.-.;
: The property consists of 'lands near Tia'
Juana, in Lower California. The Luck
hardts are descendants of one of Califor
nia's oldest families, -their maternal -vuncle
having been California's first Governor â
Pio Pico, a notable figure in California's
history. Their father, the , late C. â¢Â¦ A.
rLuckhardt, opened the first assay -office
in Los Angejes. * Later he went . to San
Francisco and became famous as. a min--,
ing engineer, his office and assay works 1 ;
there being still conducted in . his name
under the management of Captain Ward.
The senior Lucknardt was associated with
the famous Comstock lode mines in their
palmy days. Â¦ - j
In their mother's will Ruby's brother,
V. F. R. Luckhardt. was named as exec
utor of the joint estate of brother and
sister and was made her guardian. "Until
he could place her in school or could find
a home that seemed suitable for his sister
Luckhardt gave up his work as a mining
engineer. There were . matters connected
with the property, too, that demanded his
attention, . and for nearly a Â¦ year he has
been engaged in searcning records in
Mexican archives that would enable him
to place the property in condition to be
divided. . ' ' <
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 2. â Ruby M.
Liickhardt, 16 years old, recently told one
of her girl friends that she was soon i to
be married to a "Count" and was going
to Paris. A. few days latfer Miss Luck
hardt disappeared and' now her brother
Is searching-, with the assistance of detec
tives, to find what "Count" has lately
been In Los Angeles and what has become
of his sister. He is trying also j to find

with some motormen to start the car as
soon- as the signal bells were rung at

transfers to the passengers, but to take
them down to Vallejo street and there
let them step across to the up-comlng
car. Phelps said , he turned the trolley,
but got on the car to tell, the passengers
to remain aboard without waiting to
couple the car to the'grip again. The car
started without his. having given the "go

no doubt that the car was coupled to

Mrs. '* Caroline v Bopp and Mrs.> Emily
Sampson, passengers on. the 'southbound
car. that was struck. by. the runaway car,
gave . unimportant testimony. - .-;.:-;â¢
Scarcity of testimony from passengers
was one source of uncertainty as to
whether or' not - the "go ahead" signal
from the strap bell was given. Coroner
Leland was much annoyed â¢ that more
passengers had not been subpenaed bv
his deputies. His sharp Injunction to
Deputy McCormick to "dig up" some of
them would .have led one to infer that
there had been a general slaughtering of
passengers and that the unfortunates
were already beneath the sod. Â¦
Â¦ Mayor-elect Schmitz was a witness. He
told of s^ing the cars crash together: of
telephoning from his residence on Fill
more street to the Market Street Railway
offices, telling them of the accident and
asking them to send physicians, and of his
jroing to the asslstanceof the Injured.
Concerning the mechanical appliances the
Mayor-elect said he had paid particular
attention to them and deemed them ab
solutely safe. He said that if, the pre
scribed precautions were observed by. em
ployes accident would be impossible. He
had not known of any previous mishap on
the gravity line.
Motorman Deutschmann furnished .the
one dramatic Incident of/ the Inquest. He
was telllncr on the stand that he heard the
"ko ahead" bells, started on the "first
notch." heard the conductor shout "stop,"
and did stop the car. He said he looked
about and saw the conductor in the rear
of the enclosed portion of the car and
heard him explain to the passengers that
they would be transferred at Vallejo
street. As Deutschmann told - this ' he
arose to show the conductor's attitude
and, overcome with the recollection of
what followedâ the wild. ride down the hill,
the collision and the screams of- the
women and cries and ' groans of 'Â¦- the ' in

Coroner Reads a Lecture.
juries in the Fillmore-street rail
way accident on the evening of Decem
ber 23, returned a verdict that the wreck
was due to the carelessness of Timer
Alexander Cameron and Motorman A. T.
Deutschmann. The conductor, M. P.
Phelps, who failed to couple the car to
the grip on, the cable, escaped censure
because the jury believed that the testi
mony, though conflicting, snowed that
the timer rang the signal bells, indicating
that the car was attached to me cable
and ready to start, a duty tnat oeiongea
to the conauctor alone ana snould not
have been assumed by the tinier.
The testimwny demonstrated clearly
that the street car company's failure to
enrorce strictly ivs regulations as to the
duties ot aurerent employes at tne point
of danger maae the accident possible.
Mechanical appliances that Insure abso
lute safety on the gravity section oÂ£ tne
electric road were rendered inoperative
by a careless confusion of duties on the
part of two or three men.
The testimony was" not complete, as but
few passengers were placed on the stand,
and many direct contradictions left mucn
doubt as to the occurrences Immediately
prior to the wild ride down the hill. The
timer, the motorman and the signalman
an testified positively tnat they heard the
conductor's "go ahead' 1 bells. If they rang
the motorman had no duty but to obey
and switch on the current that would
send the car over the brow of the hfll.
But the conductor denied that he gave
the "go ahead" signal, and two passen
gers, who claimed to have been watching
him, say that he did not. It was three
against three, and the jury apparently
accepted the testimony of the conductor
and passengers, for it censured the ,mo
torman and had no word of condemna
tion for the conductor, who, after receiv
ing his orders from the timer, turned the
trolley and mounted the car again, leav
ing it uncoupled from 'v the cable, while he
explained to . the passengers that they
were to stay aboard, be taken back to
Vallejo street and transferred there to a
car that would take them on southward,
while his car would return, to the bay.
He alone of the three had knowledge that
the car was not attached to the cable
and that he would have to dismount
again and make the coupling before the
car could safely start down the steep in
cline.

This opinion was expressed to-night by
ah officer of the State Department whose
attention was called to the dispatch stat
ing that the Ban Righ had been armed
and equipped as a war vessel and is now
on her way to Venezuela- The Ban Righ
cannot be classed as a pirate. Secretary
Eayard's declaration that the United
States could not regard as piratical ves
sels manned by parties in arms against
the Government has been accepted by all
maritime nations. The Ban High will
therefore, not be recognized as a pirate
by warships of any nation. If upon en
tering the waters of Venezuela she should
be Eeized, then President Castro will
probably be aJlowed to Â¦wreak his will
upon the Venezuelans on board, though
the British Government will undoubtedly
be able to save any of Its subjects who
may be captured.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2.â If the steam
ship Ban -High has discarded her British
register and is actually In the service of
the insurgents of Venezuela the British
Government can offer no objection to her
seizure by the agents of President Castro.
Cannot Be Classed as a Pirate.
The volunteers said that their landing
on the coast of Venezuela was planned
to coincide with a forward movement on
the part cf the Colombian troops and the
landing in Venezuela of other revolution
ists who had concentrated at the Islands
of Trinidad and Curacao.
The reinforcements of the 300 volunteers
now on board the Ban Righ will reach the
war steamer in sloops and schooners
which are to be met at various points if
the plans of the revolutionists are car
ried cut.
Details of the conversion of the steamer
Ban High into a war vessel shows that
her vital parts (engines, etc) have been
protected by thick plates of steel. The
â¢work was cone here at the works of the
General Transatlantic Company. The Ban
Righ's armament consists of several guns
capable of firing 300 shots per minute and
four .10-centimeter rapid-fire guns. The
officer in diarge of the Ban High's guns
is a European. The vessel's crew is com

As a result of the financial embarrass

run was started on the Dime Savings and
Banking Company, of which Everett and
Moore are directors, late to-day. All de

on hand to pay all depositors who desired
their money. The institution is one of
the city depositories.. "When its last re

Personally I have had no connection with

more than a week in making an . investiga

their report should inspire' confldence. The
entire affairs of the syndicate are now under

Henry A. Everett and H. W. Moore re
fused to-day to be interviewed concerning
their artairs, declaring that a statement
issued by the company covered the entire
matter. The committee of bankers or
ganized by electing H. P. Newcomb as
chairman and E. c Tillotson secretary. '
Colonel Myron T. Herrick to : 'night gave
cut the following statement relating to
the affairs of the Everett-Moore syndi
cate:
The aggregate capitalization of all the
various pioperties owned or controlled by
the synaicate is said to be about $130,
000,000. â¢ ,
Expert accountants have been employed
by the committee in charge to examine
and report upon the condition of all the
constituent companies; No statement has
yet been given out indicating the liabili
ties of the syndicate.
Among the more Important electric
street â¢ railroad properties in which the
synaicate is largely interested are the
Cleveland Klectnc Kailway Company, the
Detroit United itailway Company, tne To
ledo Kailway and Light Company, the
Northern Ohio Traction Company, the
Cleveland, Gainesville and Eastern Rail
way Company, th6 Detroit and Toledo
Shore Line i;ailroad Company and the
Lake Shore Electric Railroad Company.
All of these lines are declared by the
committee to be, with scarcely an excep
tion, in good physical condition, perfectly
solvent and in no wise embarrassed.
The Everett-Moore syndicate is accred
ited with controlling more tnan 1200 miles
ot urban ana interurban electric lines in
Ohio and Michigan, with many new ex
tensions still in course of construction.
Among tlie telephone properties owned
outrignt or controlled by the syndicate
are tne Cuyahoga Telephone Company of
this city, with more than 10,000 subscrib
ers; the United States Telephone Com
pany (long distance.), the Federal Tele
phone Company, the Stark County (Ohio)
Telephone Company, the Columbian
County (Ohio) leiephone Company, the
People's Telephone Company of Detroit,
the Wood County {Ohio) Telephone Com
pany and a number of others in which
the Federal Telephone Company is the
controlling factor. -
Â¦ CLEVELAND. Ohio, Jan; 2.â The finan
cial affairs of the Everett-Moore syndi
cate, owning or controlling, a number of
urban and interurban electric' railways
and an extensive system of local and
long-distance telephone lines in Ohio and
Michigan, passed into the control of a
committee composed of seven prominent
bankers of this city to-day. This action
was taken, it is stated, as the result of
temporary financial embarrassment on
the part of the syndicate, which has for
some time past been affected by the strin
gency in the 'money market.
The committee chosen has been at work
investigating. arlairs of the syndicate and
expresses the tirm belief tnat the concern
i3 entirely solvent, and tnat its embar
rassment will be only temporary. -

ployed by the Free State Government.

A GREAT PLANT.
What One of the Great American.
Music Journals Says.
In a recent editorial by the editor of
the New lor*: iuusical Courier, tne great
American authority on matters muaicai,
he says: -"mere is no limit to tne ca-
pacity of the W. vV. Kimbau Company us
a piano manufacturer; every one wm au-
mit mat. Tne capacity runs in every di-
rection. There is no limit to factory ca-
pacity â no limit to the capacity to aosorb
every excellent idea in piano structure;
â¢ no limit to tne capital necessary to gat
the greatest' experts and specialists, anu
no. limit to secure the very unest material
and put it togetner in the very best style,
Â¦mat ail must be admitted.
"If piano peopie aesire to see what Is
constituted under the term â¢original' -we
advise them to Iook at the several new
designs and styles of Kimball upright
I pianos. Look at them. Tney are entirely
outside the ordinary character of piano
! case work. The tlnish Is simply exquisite.
"Then look at the Interior. The ordin-
â¢ ary. plate- styles and furnishings are sup-
i planted by new features simpiy startling.
I "Then try the pianos. Test them se-
'. verely. Go through the questions of dip.
' of repeat and of sympathy of touch. All
I these will be found delightful for pianists,
and the tone Is rich, resonant Â¦ and re-
ttned. The Kimball piano of the present
> day must be viewed as one of the great-
1 est successes of recent piano history.
; "Of course with this piano and the mil-
! lions behind it, and the brains and energy
'and the knowledge of the business and
the conditio.ns of the piano trade to aid
it. there is no difficulty in predicting the
future grandeur of the Kimball house.
"With , old houses retiring or going to
' pieces, new alignments ensuing, a rear-
rangement of the conditions of the past
proceeding vividly before U3, the Klm-
! ball house assumes an Importance that
must necessarily be felt throughout- thÂ«

Foo, in the Kansu province, ; has ap
peared.' It' appoints a special official to
puni3h those who are guilty of the crime
and reaffirmed the Dowager Empress*
good will toward Christians.
This is unusual activity upon the part of
the- court in the punishment of those
guilty of an anti-Christian outrage and
is taken as evidence of the Dowager Em
press' desire to conciliate the powers upon
the- eve of the return of tho court to Pe
king. Proofs accumulate that Prince
Chang's arguments persuaded the Dow
ager Empress, to trust herself within
range of; the legations for this. Officials
arriving here describe the Dowager Em
press,and General Lu as being extremely
nervous and suspicious lest the foreigners
are planning to entrap thereafter their

Other incidents - which â¢. are considered
significant are the suppression of the only
independent newspaper in thl3 city by or
der of the Governor of Peking and the
closing of the industrial school here, re
cently organized by philanthropic Chinese,
also by the Governor's order. This school
was intended for the training of destitute
youths. Other liberal Chinese will hesi
tate now to give practical vent to their
theories, fearing the displeasure of of
ficialdom.
PEKING, Jan. 2.â Several recent occur
rences tend to discourage the hope that
the Dowager Empress has learned a les
son of reform from the events of the past
year. Foreigners are disposed to take a
pessimistic view of the outlook. General
Yung Lu's determination to organize two
anti-foreign army corps to offset thÂ© com
mands of the pro-foreign Chinese leaders
is particularly disquieting and is evidence
of the continued domination of his in
fluence, which is bitterly anti-foreign.;

The first wetion of the chapier on municipal
elections declares that the officers in question
Â¦>ha1I be ejected for ru-o years." And the sec
tions providing specifically for *ach office In
nearly every instance prescribe that such Offi

it to mean "a period of three hundred and
tixty-five days."

So interested are the Chinese in the
matter that they purpose erecting a Joss
house in honor of Dr. Wong Woo. They
consider him a second Aesculapius, ' and
have been showering honors upon him for
some time. Lew Fook. according to re
ports, can go back to his business without
further fear of molestation. Dr. Wong
Woo has apparently solved one of the
problems of the highbinder war.
Dr. Wong T/oo triumphantly exhibits
the poultice-extracted bullet as a proof of
his skill. Foo Que Lee and Jo Due, who
were shot at the same time, also came
under the doctor's ministrations and were
cured by the same methods.
He came to me with four .wounds in hia
body. One of them was very dangerous. It
was in the same spot where McKinley was
shot. The doctors out at the City Hall could
not find the bullet. I put a plaster on it, and
two days after the bullet came out. Now he
is entirely well. Once before, in Sebastopol.
I had a similar case. Jew Wan How was shot
in the back and his case was given up by the
local physicians. . I put on my plaster and
pulled him through. At the same time How
Lue was shot in the ankle, and the bone was
shattered; now ha walks as well as ever he did.
My plaster found the bullet, Lee Fook,,. Jew
Wall How and How Lue are well men.
cures him of his injuries is considered far
above the ordinary. Dr. Wong Woo tells
a peculiar story, original in its Oriental
flavorings, as to the way he cured Lew
Fook of his wounds. He said:

ing night. The other is Dr.
Wong Woo., 764 Clay street, who, after a
futile operation had been performed at
the Central Emergency Hospital, located
and extracted the bullet that perforated
Lew Fook's stomach. Dr. Wong Woo
brought him back to health and strength
and is dividing the honors with the in
jured man.
Lew Fook's condition was considered bo
serious that his dying statement was
taken by the police. He was for a long
time considered one of the most desirable
marks for highbinder bullets in China
town, as he was the proprietor of one of
the most prosperous gambling games in
that quarter. He was attacked that night
in 4he club at 104 Waverly place and shot
four times. Some of his wounds were
superficial, hut the most dangerous
wound was In the stomach.
This wound is what gives Lew Fook
his prominence. When a Chinese high
binder is shot at once, though his wounds
may be many, his life is sacred there
after. If he lives through the ordeal, none
there is who may do him harm.
At the came time the medicine man who

an article states the reason Willie Apple

Rabbi Meyers Lectures.
Yesterday afternoon before the Council
of Jewish Women in the vestry room of
Temple EimrJiu-El a lecture on "The
Jewish Woman" was delivered by Rabbi
Isidore Myers. In the course of the lec
ture he contrasted the degraded condi
tion of women arming other races of an
tiquity and the exalted position that
Â¦women occupied in the Jewish race both
in biblical times and more especially
during the several centuries of rabbinical
development. He said that the Jewish
v.oman was invested by the rabbis with
the holiest of missionsâ the mission of
love. He pointed out her rights and
duties as a wife, as a. mother, as the
angel of charity and as the' priestess of
her home. Woman was spoken of by the
rabbis in terms of the greatest tender
ness, gracefulness and purity- AVomen
like angels were made the messengers of
peace and love, of the subllmest thought
mid the noblest sentiments. Every age,
according to the rabbis, can only be re
generated through tbe influence of its
noble women. The founder of the Greek
race was said to have been saved by a
Koat. The founder of the Roman nation
was saved by a she wolf. Moses, the
founder of the Jewish nation, was saved
hy his mother. The preservation of the
Jewish race during many centuries of
persecution is chiefly due to the devotion
of the Jewish woman to her God, to her
husband, to her children and to her home,
which she kept pure and godly and con
verted Into a sanctuary.

The Commissioners also Â¦ ordered | the
construction, of ' a footpath on the west
side of the great highway leading -to' the
cliff and beach. .Hitherto in entering the
park from the ocean side the pedestrians
have been in doubt as : to where to walk.
The only road, for a considerable distance
into tha park has had no footpath and
the pedestrians were kept continually
dodging horses, automobiles and bicycles.
The. board has found that the water. in
the valley from which the. park supply
has- been pumped is in danger, of being
exhausted. To augment the supply, the
Commissioners decided to erect "a wind-,
mill directly back of the .Government life
saving station on the beach, where it has
been found that a flow of 20,000 gallons of
fresh water an hour can.be obtained. ;
For the convenience of the tennis play
ers the board ordered four shower baths
to be built at the tennis courts.
The board decided to have a tunnel dug
on the north' side of the park similar to
the one leading from the terminus of the
Haight-street car line." This tunnel, will
enable the public to enter the grand
court without passing over the bridge,
which Is' usually crowded with vehicles. Â¦..
At a meeting of the Park Commission
ers held yesterday afternoon it was" de
cided, after a thorough discussion, that
the condition of the exchequer at the

sioners, without exception, expressed
themselves as being in favor of an aqua

$100,000, a sum. too great to be appropri
ated for such a project. ' â¢ :

WASHINGTON, Jan. 2.â The dinner to

functions of the year at the White House,
was given by the . President and Mrs.
Roosevelt to-night. A large number, of
persons were invited to meet the mem
bers of the Cabinet, the guests including

The Marine Band furnished the music.
Those present, in addition to the President
and Mrs. Roosevelt, were: .
. Drouet wrung success out ; of the un-,
promising role of Armand. He gave a
rendering of the. part- conspicuous , for
cumulative power, passion, sympathy and
convincing quality. The part of Mons. l)u
valwas admirably sustained ,by, Carl
Ahrendt: H. S. Northrup was a slfflclenlly
vicious De Varville to receive the ac
knowledgement of hisses from the audi
ence: Charles Cherry was a charming Xel
low as Gaston; Mrs. E. A. Eberle gave a
good but rather comic valentiny of Mme.
Prudence;. Margaret- Moffatt as Nichctte
showed spirit and originality; Amy.Ric
ard did all that was necessary as Nanlne,
and Amy Rankin, a local light, was
Olympe. . - â¢
1 But her after success, as the repentant
Camille. more . particularly in the scene
with Armand's fatherâ as purely, artistic
and pathetic bit of ' acting as has been
seen for a long day : on the local stage -
was Instant and unquestioned. After the
gambling scene, where Robert Drouet, as
Armand. shared honors with the star, the
curtain was lifted. again, and again to the
insistent demand of the delighted audi
ence, who succeeded at last in getting the
actors before the curtain -after a. little
matter of ten or twelve recalls. ..
Her first scene in "Camille" promised a
flat failure. Arch," gay, innocently allur
ing, she might have been Â¦.: anything
rather than the creature she .was attempt
ing to depict. The canker in the charac
ter -was -not there,- the erotic- suggestion,
the subtle atmosphere of corruption that
Bernhardt suggested bo powerfully. It
is a constitutional lack. Miss Mannering
was not born that way. with that kind of
vision, that kind .of 'speech. It is out of
her. emotional gamut, . pitched out of her
compass, a foreign tongue to her. .
I A thing' or two does come our way now
and again, even if San j Francisco Is . at
the end of the , world to the . theatrical
manager. ;~ One came yesterday, in Mary
Mannering's first' adventure into the emo-,
tlonal ' domain of ."Camille." one of the
most Interesting 1 dramatic- experiments
that we have y^t had the, chance to see
tried here. The role, so far as was known
of . Miss â¢ Manneringr's work, ; was | entirely
foreign to all her previous efforts, the
character, the whole atmosphere of the
play essentially, different- from anything
with which she had before been concerned.
A role essentially subtle, complex,, de
manding large emotional power, the tragic
note, 'the erotic key, Â¦ was â¢ not' the sort of
part' that one found it easy to flt Mis*
Mannerlng into. Even among her faithr
fuleet followers-^and the r Columbia was
full of them yesterday â there were I those
who prophesied failure â¢ for, the young
.beauty who has taken the town by storm.
XnÂ© others, of course, were. ready; to bet
their. 1 best boots on her success In any
thing she attempted. ' :
It fell out, however; that both were right
â and Â¦ wrong. . As far as a -woman with an
atmosphere as pure as a new-blown -rose
could suggest the Parisian cocotte, skilled'
in all the vicious arts of .unlawful allure
ment; sad, with .the horrible cynicism
born* of her dreadful knowledge; glad,
with a gayety sadder than' tears; and
strong in the frightful philosophy- her life
had taught. Just so far was Mary Man
nering successful as Camille: That is, not
very far, on that side of the character.
The repentant Camille Is another story,
for here Miss Mannering achieved' an un
qualified success. To. say that the actress
displayed strong emotional power, an easy
perfection of technique, a delicate finish,
restraint; naturalness, classic grace and,
more than all, an Irresistible pathos that
set men sniffing and women to sobbing
outright, this would be to mention only
the beginning- -of her accomplishment.
There is everything here for a Juliet, an
Imogene, â¢ an. Ophelia, a Viola, and Miss
Mannerlng is wasting her sweetness' on
Janice 'Merediths and 'Camilles. True,
there is an infinite deal more of her ,in
"Camille" than in the other role, but
neither get the best that she has to give,

Contest for Leadership
of Ohio Legislature
Grows Tense.
Lines Are Now Drawn on
Old Question of Local
Option.
COLUMBUS, Ohio. Jan. 2.â The contest
between Republican factions over the or
ganization of the Legislature is in doubt
so far as the House is concerned. Th3
claims of either faction would indicate
that one element is confident of Price
becoming Speaker and the other of Mc-
Kennon, but the efforts of both show that
there are yet "votes to get" by whomso
ever becomes Speaker. The list of un
pledged members haSj however, been re
duced to-day to a half dozen. These six
are said to have made no pledge* to either
fide, and it Is conceded that they hold the
balance of power.
There was much work done to-day from
the homes of Senator Hanna in Wash
ington. Senator Foraker in Cincinnati.
Congressman Dick in Akron. Congress
man Taylor in Columbiana and others,
especially at Toledo, where Representa
tive Denman is st'll considered by some
ts doubtful.
There was much communication with
all the counties In which doubtful mem
bers reside.
The most prominent arrival was that of
George B. Cox, the Cincinnati leader, who
Insists that he Is as "good a friend of
Senator Hanna as ever," but that he was
pledged to Price for Speaker before the
Junior Ohio Senator broke with Price and
that he is here now to do all he can for
Price.
The leadership of the antl-Hanna side
was conceded to Cox on his arrival.
It is claimed that the developments to
day indicate that Congressman Taylor of
the old McKinlev district will likely be
Â«m opponent of Congressman Dick for the
next Republican gubernatorial nomination
and that Taylor from his home Is work-
Ing as hard for Price as Dick is working
for McKir.r.cn.
The lines have been distinctly drawn
on the old question of local option. The
liQUor associations have representatives
here for Price and the Ohio Anti-Slater
League for McKlnnon. In the last Leg
islature Price opposed the Clark local op
tion bill and McKinnon supported It.
The Senate standing committees are se
lected by the Senators themselves and
the House committees are all named uy

At the present time Democracy has three military
men suggested as candidates for- the Presidency,
Dewey, Schley and Miles; but it is to be noted that
Mr. Bryan has resumed his activity and will deliver

Judging by , his past record there -is every", reason
for expecting Palma to- lay the. foundations of Cuban
government firmly and justly.', 'He was. prominent in
Under any circumstances it is to be regretted that
the first contest in the island should have resulted in i
the withdrawal of one party before the election took
place. There is in it' an implied menace to appeal
from the ballot to the ' sword. V. So long as the United.
States troops remain in the island there is' no dan
ger: of such ah appeal; but t^ey .must be withdrawn
sooner or â¢ later, and - it will; t^en behoove -the newly
elected President to see to jt that order is maintained
and any effort at civil, disturbance promptly sup
pressed. Palma enters, therefore, upon a difficult']
task, and merits American , sympathy in every- well
directed effort to accomplish Â¦â¢ ii with success.
] One of the curious features of the situation is that
the successful candidate has been living, in the
United States while the campaign was at its hottest
A New York dispatch announces that Palma was
seen on the night after the election "in his home in
Central Valley, N. Y.," and announced that his aim
as President of Cuba would be' to .strengthen the
pleasant relations that now exist between Cuba and
the United States. .It is somewhat surprising that
the successful candidate should have remained in this
country instead of going to Cuba to lead his follow
ing, particularly, as the opposition to him was based
upon the charge that he is more subject to "American
than to" Cuban influences. It would seem that he had
no doubt about ..the iesult, and it may be. there was
some truth in the charge of the. Maso party, that - the
election was fixed; beforehand and that for 'them to
take part in it would be a farce.
DISPATCHES from Cuba announce that in al
most, all election districts the Maso party
fulfilled their threat of ignoring. the election
and withdrew their candidates for Presidential and
Senatorial electors. The result .was a light vote arid
the overwhelming success of the party of Palma.
While, therefore, the formal election of the President
does not take place until next month, Cuba has vir
tually chosen her first chief magistrate and is about
to enter upon the experiment of self-government.

A Philadelphia millionaire helped out the Christ

and shows what a nice and economical thing it is to

Southern California has made effective use of "the
excellence r of her winter climate as a means of at
tracting settlers. San Francisco and the district
round the bay should follow the example. We have
never advertised as we should the advantages of the

take such- a celebration; Certainly .our â¢ midwinter;
climate deserves more attention -than we give = it. ,
It is to note the success of festivals like
this. They serve. the double purpose" of providing a
joyous holiday for all who are in reach of them and
at the same time they demonstrate and advertise the
delights of our midwinter climate.; With ' each suc
cessive fete of the kind a new proof is given that it is

Another, friend of the department, CM.
H., writes: "The steamer wasthe Oregon
of the New: York and Fall River route.
She was lost on Fishers Island and many
lives i were lost. , > Daniel Webster arrived
in New York the day. before Thanksgiv
ing, 1847, on his ,way from Washington to
Marshfleld. He and a friend drove to the
wharf ., just : before the steamer , was to
leave. Webster remarked that there was
a : fearful storm- on and* his , friend with ;
difficulty persuaded him not to go on
board." '
Having formerly resided near Norwich I can
answer the query as to the steamer asked
about by C. F. F. The name of the ill-fated'
steamer was the Atlantic, commanded by Cap
tain Hllliard. She left Allyn's Point three
miles south of Norwich, on the arrival of the
train from Boston, via. Worcester, with pas
sengers for New York.~ The steamer left the
wharf at ; 10 o'clock at night, a very strong
gale from .the northwest .blowing. at the time.
Daniel Webster was one of the passengers on
j the i train from Boston, but . decided to remain
over until the next day. fearing that some dis
aster might occur. When the Atlantic Â¦was
about five miles off New London light thÂ«
steam Â¦_ chest burst and she became- helpless;
both" anchors were let j go, but the steamer
dragged them during the night, owing to .the
heavy sea that was raging, and at' 9 o'clock
November" 25. .1846 (Thanksgiving day),' she
went upon the rocks at the. west end of Fish
er's; Island. Â¦ But few of the, eighty: or more
passengers were saved. Captain Hilliard went
down with his vessel. .

A strong guild of classicists yet holds its ground in
our universities, but the children of the people are
turning to the studies which increase the power of
man over nature, and not his knowledge of a dead
language and the blind staggering of the races that
thought in it and were without knowledge of the
physical universe of which they were a part
The useful man of these days does not patter Latin.
He is at work upon the dynamic problems which af
fect the welfare of the race. He has applied power
and has derived it from sources unknown in that age
when learning consisted in reading Virgil, Caesar and
the literature of the Augustan age in the original: .
Learning now has its best application in the study
of man and his needs. Compare our scientific agri
culture, with its analysis of soils, its breeding of
plants, its vegetable physiology and pathology, its
hybridizing, its adaptation of food to desired results,
with the bucolics, and the dependence of man upon
the practical is revealed.
Since" then practically the whole of physics has
been born, and its application to materialities is that
great body of applied science which distinguishes the
modern* world. . ' ' -V
Latin has been made a fetich because in the
middle ages, and long subsequently, to know it , was
accepted as evidence of great learning and accom
plishment . But when it was advanced to the head
ship of studies physics was practically unknown. At
that time the world had alchemy instead of- chemistry
and astrology instead of astronomy^ and the nobler
uses of mathematics were unknown.
t-x RESIDENT JORDAN, of Stanford has ex-
I â ' pressed the thoughts of many educators in de
Â«Â¦â¢ moting Latin from the primacy it has too long
enjoyed in the curriculum of the schools and univer- j
sities. A knowledge of its grammatical structure
may be acquired, to serve as information upon its
derivatives incorporated into the English tongue, but
to make it the leading part of a scholastic course is '
to divert attention and take time from learning that
is far more important to the modern man or woman.
Dr. Jordan is himself in the front rank of American
scholars, but how small a part of his eminence is due
to his Latin! * '. Â¦ . ' y * 'i:',

There are other seals of various shapes and sizes belong

above brief description, .suffices .to show the uses to which
they are put by the Empress Dowager. In fact, the Interest

writing or painting a scroll she used thesÂ© seals on It to show
where it was done. There Is another pair of similarly shaped
seals .belonging to the Lichinghslen Court, one of which has
dragons and the other phoenixes carved on the borders. As a
matter of fact, the phoenix is the special mark or crest of aa
Empress or Empress Dowager of the Chinese empire, while
the dragon is the mark of the Emperor. In the present case,
however, the Empress Dowager, having usurped, the reins of
government, arrogated to herself the prerogatives of the Em
peror, and â¢ therefore she had dragons carved on the borders
of one of these seals of the Ldchinghsien Court. This makes
the pair of seals belonging to that court the most Interesting
of the whole lot of the Empress Dowager's seals, and will bo
a token -to succeeding generations of her usurpation and tha
reality of her power in the empire.
Of these jadestone seals the most beautifully carved are a
pair of rectangular-shaped ones" with phoenixes carved on the
borders, while the characters in the middle denote that they
belonged to the Yik'un Palaceâ that is. to say, when the Em

â¢ Shortly after the principal foreign nations had
raised the rank of their representatives in this coun
try ; from 'Minister to Embassador theVe arose a
squabble over the question of precedence. Tom
Reed, who at .that time was 'Speaker of the House,
disposed of. his share ' irirthe fuss by saying that since
we had asked for the presence of the representatives
of royalty, we must concede to them the 7 precedence
to; which their dignity entitles them. "We cannot
have Embassadors," he said, "and treat , them like
Ministers." That seems to be the philosophy as well
as the etiquette 'of the subject. We cannot have a
brilliant^ capital on .a o'uli salary list. Congress, there
fore might as well put an end to the agony and pass
the salary bills. They will help to, reduce the % surplus
and to keep it from occurring again.
While . the names of the officials quoted are not
given it .is probable the stories are true. Washing
ton has ceased to be a simple country town where a
man with $8000 a year and perquisites could afford
to entertain his friends. It has become one of the
most extravagant and expensive capitals in the
world: No: matter how simple may be the ideas and
how frugal the habits of the man who goes to Wash
ington to :serve the Government, he soon gets I high
ideas. The s first time he meets* an Embassador he
feels that he .'must raise" his style of living to the Em
bassadoriai: level. The Cabinet officers are not the
only ones ; affected. ---The desire for; higher pay and
a larger life. runs all along, the line; The Senators^
for example, are; not asking for more pay directly^
but they are discussing a .scheme to get the Govern
ment to furnish each of them with. two committee
rooms. By and;by they will demand an official Sen
atorial residence with a salary to fit it."
It is stated that -the recent. resignations from, the
Cabinet have been due mainly to :the .inability .of 'the
resigning omciajs ; ;to any- longer Â¦sacrifice their: pri
vate^ interests by continuing : in :public~omce at an
inadequate salary. ;' One Â¦ Cabinet officer/ name ' not â¢
given, is reported to have said that , the rent of his
house in Washington is very nearly equal; to the en
tire! amount of his official salary. Another, who lives
in a more . modest way, is quoted as saying that a
fitting residence in the fashionable part of the capi
tal cannot be for less than $4000, and as his
salary -is but $8000 he cannot keep up the hospitality
required of his position without drav/ing on his pri
vate fortune. ' Â¦
POR a long time past there has been- a strong
movement 'in Washington to bring about:, an
A ; increase in the salaries, .of the higher officials
of the -Government.. Bills/to'Uhat effectVhave been
repeatedly : introduced and this Congress! will have a

Charles C. Dawes, former 1 Comptroller' of the Cur
rency, says that ithe -Â¦'next Presidential campaign will
bejfought on the .issue of "asset currency," so the
spell binders' might as well get^ in and begin to. study
ther subject so as to-be -able to illustrate ' it on the
stump with entertaining, anecdotes.
The United States does not own Cuba, but it does
own the Philippines and will maintain a tariff on
Philippine sugar. A policy thatjshuts out Philippine
sugar by a tariff and lets Cuban sugar, in free would
be a sight for gods and men, and would be matter
for hooting in a campaign.
Applying its misrepresentation of Mr. . Oxnard's
statement of conditions under the free sugar of the
McKinley bill, the junta says: "Cuba knocks at our
door asking help.- Why should it be denied? Have
we not assumed a protectorate over the island? Do
we not practically direct its government? Cuban in
terests are, ours, and w"e should deal with Cuba on a
basis of broad liberality commensurate with the
power and; generosity of this great republic. It is
for the United States to make or unmake Cuba. Per
petuation of the present raw sugar tariff on imports
from that island means its ruination. Should we ac
cept such responsibility? It is on record and beyond
j question that the domestic beet sugar industry, is a
' self-supporting and profitable enterprise without the
aid of Government protection." The "record" re
ferred to is what" Mr. Oxnard said about it when it
received a bounty of 2 cents a "pound;- the 'fact being
that beet sugar has never been. a single hour without
protection., either by tariff or bounty, so that there
is not one hour's experience to prove theassertion
of the junta that it is profitable without protection.
but lying is a vice.
While assailing Mr. Oxnard's consistency the junta
should tell the truth. Inconsistency may be 'a folly,
All of this is put out to allay the fears of American
sugar producers and in the hope that they will forget
that Mr. Oxnard's statement wasjaased on the fact
that while the McKinley bill admitted raw slgar free
it" also paid a bounty of 2 cents a pound on domestic
sugar, beet, cane and maple.
Some of these have decided to make a personal is
sue of Mr. Henry Oxnard, who has been and isj a
leading promoter of American beet sugar. It is not
necessary to defend the consistency of Mr. Oxnard's
statistics as a promoter and investor with his argu
ments against free trade in sugar. Nor is it necessary
to vindicate him as the beginning or the end^ot wis
dom on the subject. The farmers, who have felt the
relief of a new use. for their land, and the benefit of
a new crop more profitable than any of their former'
staples, have ideas on the subject which do not at all
depend on anything Mr. Oxnard has done or omitted.
Yet the junta seems to wish to go to trial on, the."
consistency of Mr. Oxnard. To this, end it is ex
pensively circulating a statement by him that, under
the McKinley bill, which admitted raw sugar free, the
lowest average price for sugar was 4 cents a pound,
being a reduction of 2.17 cents a pound from the ave
rage of the year before that law took effect. The
junta says: "But tint did not dismay Promoter Ox
nard a little bit. Indeed he went on to show how,
even at the free trade price, the beet men could pros
per amazingly. His experience. showed that^ conser
vatively estimated," beets would .yield 250 j pounds
granulated sugar per ton. This at 4 cents a pound
meant $10 a ton for. every ton of beets marketed. The
cost of the beets was $4 per ton, the cost of working â¢
them into sugar was $3 per ton. This would leave
a net profit of $3 per ton."
Seeing this, the Post enlists under the banner of
the junta and fights! he' battle of free trade from prin
ciple. Knowing its motive one . can easily respect its
tactical acuteness. But we may not respect, for that
or any other reason, other organs and agencies of the
junta. * . . ,
THE New York Evening Post, free trade, nat
urally supports the Cuban junta in its proposed
removal of protection from the^ American sugar
and tobacco growers. It would with 'equal energy
support free tin, plate glass, silk and the numerous
other articles which have -been domesticated in this
country by protection. . The free traders are wise in
their day and generation: . They .know' that the
strength of protection lies in- its support by the farm
ers of this country. Withdraw that and the -system
will" fall. : r They know, too, that the best way to turn
the farmers against protection is to deprive them of
it. When they are no longer in a system which can
justify itself only in', its equal application to agricul
ture and manufactures they will resent its use as a
means of extending. Government partiality and favor
to one class of industries at the expense of -another
class. â¢ ... " . . , , â¢Â¦â¢â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦',

MOBE WRECKAGE REPORTED.
While there the Indiana and Pennsyl
vania have been, remodeled. Nearly all
of the cabin accommodations have been
removed and new decks put in. The boil
ers have been renewed and the refriger
ating plants put in the very best of order.
During the war each vessel carried more
than 1500 soldiers in an emergency, be
sides 200 cabin passengers. From now on
they will only have room for forty cabin
passengers each and no soldiers, all the
room being set aside for freight. During
the remodeling of the Indiana and Penn
sylvania the Ohio has been used as a
boarding-house. The machinists and car
penters and boiler-makers from the works
have lived aboard her and at the same
time given her an overhauling. The Ohio
has not been altered as far as cabin ac
commodations are concerned, and she
will be the passenger vessel of the fleet.
The work of getting the Albion ready
for the interisland trade Is now being
rushed, and the chances are that as soon
as she is ready for her run to Manila the
Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania will be
ready to begin their' trips. All three ves
sels are of the same dimensions, but vary
somewhat in tonnage^wing to the differ
ence in their fittings. They are 343 feet
long, 43 feet beam and 24 feet 9 inches
deep. - Â¦
The Ohio. Indiana and Pennsylvania
are well known in transport service.
They came here atahe beginning of the
war to enter the Klondike trade, but the
United States was then securing every
available vessel to carry soldiers to the
Philippines, so the steamships were at
once chartered. Being very handy craft,
they were kept in the interisland service,
carrying soldiers and supplies all through
the war. About six months ago they
came back to San Francisco and have
since been laid up at the Union Iron
Works.
The line will be established, however,
and by the Empire Steamship Company.
That concern is acting In conjunction with
the persons who purchased the Albion a
few days ago. It will put on the run be
tween San Francisco and Manila the
steamsfilps Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylva
nia, while the Albion will run in the in
terlsland trade.
FOR months past there have been
rumors of a merchant line of
steamships from this port to Ma
nila- Some people said the Pacific
Mall Steamship Company would
put on a fleet and others asserted that a
syndicate would purchase the Govern
ment transports and run them as an in
dependent line. The Pacific Mall is making
no move in the direction of a Philippine
service and the transports - are here to
stay as long as Uncle Sam wants them
to carry his soldiers and their belongings
to and from the seat of trouble in his
latest possession.

NEWS OF THE OCEAN".
On petition of interested property own
ers the Board of Works was requested to
notify Cushing, Wetmore : & Co. to dis
charge\blasts of less size on Telegraph
Hill, so that adjacent property will not
be damaged. -. :
Joseph Rothschild opposed the improve
ment, contending that it will "villagize"
the city to plant trees > in the center of
streets. , Robert Ewing. Charles Acker
man and W. L. Bradbury addressed the
committee in favor of the project. Acker
man , stated that when Euclid avenue, in
Cleveland, was improved in a similar
manner property values increased from
$30 to $2000 per front foot. -
James Cavanagh and William. Redpath
objected, to granting permission to the
Chutes Company to erect a bridge across
Tenth avenue, and the matter went over
to allow the committee to visit the prem
ises in company with petitioners and pro
testants..' Charles Ackerman explained
that the bridge was a necessity as an
additional means of emergency exit from
the theater and a safeguard to public life.
. The Supervisors' Street Committee yes
terday reported In favor of the passage
of a bill repealing the franchise granted
the Bay and Coast Railway Company to
enter the city at Twenty-fourth and Illi
nois streets. Action was taken on the
report of the Board of Public Works that
the company has failed ' to comply with
the conditions imposed in its charter. The
company was required to expend $25,000
in construction work within a period of
two years, bu^ has not done so.
The bill providing for the adornment of
Van Ness avenue, between Bush and
Pine streets, was amended to provide for
the construction of granite or cement
curbs on the sidewalks, as the Board - of
Works may determine, and also to state
that the project is intended as an experi
ment and that in case of a general ex
pression of Â¦ disapproval from Van Ness
avenue property owners the board will
restore the roadway to its original condi
tion. â¢ ; ; â¢â¢
This Is the first case of the sort pros
ecuted by the electric, company. Others
suspected of tapping the wires are under
surveillance. â¢
Beck brought some witnesses, among
them Policeman Thomson and a special
officer, - to testify that his incandescent
lights were put out each night about " 9
o'clock and the two arc lights about 10:;w
o'clock. Beck testified , that he had got
an electrician named Peacock .to put
wires in his store for the sake of econ
omy, but denied tapping the wires him
self or knowing that they were tapped.
He admitted ln cross-examination that he
burned thirty-seven incandescent llghu
and two arc lights, and when shown that
his bills -never exceeded .$11 per month
and were as low as $6 be could not give
a ' satisfactory explanation of his plea of
economy. .... Â¦"
Beck was convicted by the jury, which
was out but a short time.
. The principal witness for the prosecu
tion was Seth Cohen, inspector of meters
for the, company. Last November Cohen j
examined Beck'3 premises and after a I
careful search he discovered that , the
company's wires had been cut and tapped
by two wires that fed thirty-eight in
candescent lights which were not regis
tered at the meter. The connections were
made ln what was supposed to be a store
room. Beck's contract witn the company
called for live incandescent and two arc
lights. Cohen was corroborated by G. W.
Carroll, another employe of tho company.
William O. PennycooK, inspector in tne
city department ot electricity, testined to
having seen on July 'a last about forty
Incandescent lignta burning in Beck's
store. He asked Butler, the clerk, wno
had done the job, and Butler replied "tha
boss." Butler was instructed to tell
Beck to call at- the office of the depart
ment, but he,,flid not do so. W. R. Hew
itt, chief electrician in the department ot
electricity, also testified that Beck told
him he had done the work himself. Other
witnesses examined were Frank Bride
man . of the same department, Jesse
Mayer and Ward A. 'I>wight Jr. of -the
Independent Company, and George C.
Butler, Beck's clerk.
The trial of Ignatz Beck, druggist. Ellis
and Buchanan streets, on the charge of
tapping the main conduit wire. of the In- â¢
dependent Electric Light and Power Com
pany in his store with the object of de
frauding the company, was held before
a jury in Judge Fritz's court yesterday
afternoon. Â¦ Colonel' E. F. Preston con
ducted the prosecution and the defendant
was represented by Attorney Samuels.
The United States army transport
Thomas has been ordered to the Union
Iron Works for repairs. Â»
The steamer Chehalls, which was towed
down here from Eureka, has received her
machinery and will have her trial trip
Saturday.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Corona has been laid up for, repairs and
tho Coos Bay will run in "her place. Â¦
The ships Willy Rlckmers and . SJerra
Blanca both cleared for Queenstown with
grain yesterday.
Captain Christian Y. Fosen is not going
out on the Grace Dollar this trip and
Captain Johnson takes his place. Instead
Captain Fosen will go out as chief^ officer
of the new steamer Melville Dollar under
Captain Gow. In spite of the apparent
"Irish "raise," Captain Fosen was the
proudest man on the front. HeJs wear
ing the handsomest gold watch and chain
that money could buy and it came from
his employers. He is the commodore of
the Dollar fleet and Captain Gow is new
to the coast. When Mr. Dollar asked him
if he would give the new master all the
information possible Fosen at once con
sented. Turning to Captain Gow he ask
ed, "Have you a full crew?" and the an
swer was, "No, I lack a first mate." "All
right," said Fosen, "I'll ship as first mate
and make the run with you." This spirit
cf willingness so pleased Mr. Dollar that
the watch and chain presentation fol
lowed.
Captain Charles Minor Goodall goes

at the hands of Fairo Bandoni, drew a
pistol and began shooting. - Alphonso Pe

tons of cargo. The run down the coast
was uneventful. Captain Doran said:
"We went ashore twenty miles south

While in Milan Manager Leahy - will
study the architecture and seating plans
of its grand opera-houses with a view to
ward incorporating the ideas thus gained
in the plans for the new Tivoli which is
to be built in this city ; next' year. He
will also get some ' ideas about a Verdi
statue, for the erection of which money
is now being raised in this city. Alto
gether "Doc", has a big contract on ins
hands and it is likely that he will crowd
much activity Â¦ into his life during the
next two months.
In Milan I will see Riccordi, thr great pub
lisher of operas, and- arrange with him for
productions of such works as "La Tosca," "Fe
dora," "Andre Chenier" and others of that
class. ; When I have Â¦ completed . my work ln
Italy I will go to Paris and London. . In the
English capital I will see George Edwards re
garding numerous light operas which have been
produced on the Continent, but never seen here.
When I return I expect to be in possession of
a musical treasure trove which will delight our
patrons for months to come. I expect to return
home about March 1.
I shall leave San Francisco ln time. to catch
the Italian steamer Liguria, which leaves New
York for Naples on the 16th inst. I shall then
make trips to Rome, Milan, Florence and other
cities - and attend the great theaters of those
cities in which the presentation of grand opera
is exclusive. My purpose is to hear, the best
vocalists and witness the : presentation of the
best grand operas.. In this way I shall be en
abled to secure just such artists and operas
aa will be suited to the lovers of the best music
in Â§an Francisco. I will sign no less than eight
singers of both sexes and they shall be the best
that money can procure. â¢ .
. It is the; custom of the Tivoli manage
ment to hold a grand opera season each
fall at which the latest operas are
presented by the great European ' artists.
â¢It is, true such stars as Calve, Eames and
Sembrich have not yet been seen at the
Tivoli, . but that is ? not the fault of , the
enterprising management. Previous en
gagements alone rendered it impossible
for , them , to close contracts .with "Doc,"
but in their "stead such vocalists as Col
lamarini, â¢ Salassa and others Â¦ have been
secured to the delight of the Tivoli pat
rons, "Whose musical education is not a
whit inferior to that of the average per
son whom a Grau season at $7 a seat
serves to throw into spasms of artistic
fervor. '.< It is this disposition of the Tivoli
management to give the best for the least
money that has ; contributed so largely to
the success and. fame of- that house and
has served to keep the popular taste for
the best works of world-famed composers
whetted for more. :
Manager Leahy's purpose- in making the
trip to Italy is to secure ' several vocal
stars and the best and latest : composi
tions of renowned" composers. In explain
ing the objects of his journey to the Old
World Manager Leahy said: .
Genial William H. Leahy, business man
ager of ; the Tivoli, will leave for Italy
next week, on a â¢mission': of-. Bupreme im
portance to the Â¦" patrons : of that' popular
house. It lsbecause of his contemplated
journey that "Doc" has been studying in
secret one of those works the perusal . of
which will enable one, to master at a sin
gle breath the intricacies of a foreign
tongue, .but .which ; in, his case has re
sulted in mystifying: him more and more
as he advanced, until now he 7 sadly con
fesses Jthat; his Italian vocabulary is lim
ited to . Vslgnore" and ', "signora," with -a
"si".- thrown in for company's sake. Â¦

tjnna defines a cause.
European Skin Specialist Says Dan-
druff Is Caused by Parasites.
Upon that theory, proved beyond a
doubt, a cure for dandruff was sought
after. Scientists, chemists, druggists and
physicians all "took ,a hand" and the
successful issue is the present product
known as "Newbro's Herpicide.'' ' ,';
This remedy actually kills the parasites
that infest the hair bulb, does its work
most effectively, and contains not an atom
of substance injurious to anything else
than the germ alone. Herpicide causes
the hair to grow as nature intended It
should, soft and abundant. '

Mail advices from New York say; "The
market is very quiet at all points at the mo
ment and trade from now until after January

strong, however, and with epot stocks moder
ate an active and healthy condition is looked
for during the early month of 1902. Prunes
are firmer on the coast, new Santa Claras be
ing more generally held at a 3%c basis. Some
eizes are still available %c less. Some business
was reported in email Elzes at a 3%c basis,

coast yesterday at a 3c basis, but some va
rieties other than Santa Claras, it is under
stood, still offer at %c less. Oregons are most
ly held at a 2%c basis, this being an advance
of lc over the price which prevailed not many
â¢weeks back. Raisins continue withdrawn by
nearly all packers in California, but some still
quote loose Muscatels on the basis of the last
advance. New prices will be made by the
seeding combine, it is expected, after the first
of the year. Currants are firm at 5%c for
Amalias on the spot, sale of 100 barrels being
made at that figure. Goods to arrive per Mlr

New York Stock Market:
NEW YORK, Jan.>2.â The first day of trad
ing of the new year on the Stock Exchange was
signalized by a Jump in the volume of trad-
Ing to upward of a million shares. The coal
pti. and the Pacifies were easily the leaders
in the market, but the dealings were broadly
distributed and the Â¦ strength was fairly dis
seminated through ' the general list. The In
dustrial stocks were inconspicuous except for
a few of the most important issues, euch aa
United States Steel. Sugar and 'Amalgamated
Copper and People's Gas. Amalgamated Cop
per had a period of weakness during the early
part of the day and Sugar showed occasional
relapses. There was very heavy realizing in
the course of the day, but the offerings were
well taken and at a cost of on.ly fractional
losses in the prices. The way in which one
stock or group of stocks and then another was
brought forward into the advance was char
acteristic of the methods of professional oper
ators of large caliber and as each new point of
strength developed the preceding stocks were
sold to realize. In this way the equipoise
was maintained and speculative holdings were
transferred from one quarter to another, per
meating the whole market. The demand was
apparently . based on general considerations of
a good prospect of continued prosperity of the
country for the new year and the hope of an
early relaxation in the money market Call
loar; rates were not so Etringent as on Monday
and Tuesday, but the money market continued
stiff and the bulk of operations was appar
ently by those not dependent for resources on
the call loan market. The Inspired intima
tions of the completion of the retirement of
Northern Pacific preferred and of the rapid
progress of exchange Into the Northern Securi
ties Company's stock had a notable effect in
relieving the depression " which . has been
caused by the fears that that project would
be obstructed before its successful consum
mation. The payment ; for redemption of
Northern Pacific preferred was believed to be
a factor in relieving the money market. The
prospect of a further effect from the large
January disbursements was an additional mo
tive in the speculation. With the Northern
Pacific project out of the way, it is believed
that other projects for combinations . will be
pushed forward.' It is confidently believed
that the anthracite coalers are destined for
euch a combination. The speculation in this
group and the Pacifies to-day may be at
tributed to thÂ«>se causes. The buying of Balti
more & Ohio was by the same brokers con
spicuous in the operations In the anthracite
group.
Amalgamated Copper was helped by the firm
ness of the raw copper market in London and
by rumors that a powerful syndicate had been
formed to hold the company's accumulated
stocks of copper. The closing was active and
easy on realizations.
The railway bond market was active and
broad and there was a good absorption of high
grade bonds. Total sales, $4,640,000.

The Grocers' Fruit Growing Company is
suing the Kern County Land Company to
recover a valuable tract of land in Kern
County. The plaintiffs claim that they
acquired the 500 acres in dispute from
the land company in March, 1896, for $35,
000, the sum to be paid in installments.
They made a number of improvements "on
the tract. Because the plaintiffs could
not pay the installments they gave the
property back to the defendants, they say,
with the agreement that all the profits de
rived from the ranch should be credited
to them so that they could regain posses
sion of the land. It is now alleged that
because of the increase in value of the
property the defendant company displays
an unwillingness to carry out the agree

from a 38-caliber weapon.
The bullet passed through a closely cur

glass and at an acute angle with its sur
face. It then went through the top of
one of the high double doors between the
rear and front parlors, struck a picture
frame upon one wall, glanced to another
and then to the floor. Miss Etta Hey

Conklin insisted when he regained his
senses that it was a mistakeâ that ho
had accidentally blown out the gas in
the cell. The jailers were so sure that
their prisoner had tried to end his life
that they removed him to the main part
of the Jail, where he could be watched.
While making his rounds to-night James
Swain smelled the odor of gas coming
from the alleged bigamist's cell and
found Conklin lying on the cot nearly
suffocated. The jailer opened the cell

lin out of the tank. .Â¦:,-Â¦

767 Twenty-seventh street, is prostrated.
Depositions from the East have been sent

To call him a man who could desert his
three dear little ones Is out of all reason and
unnatural beyond the brutes. I suppose he has
falsely informed you of my daughter having a
divorce. She has not and never will till he has
received his Just reward. I have friends in San
Francisco, also- a brother-in-law, and expect to
see them in the near future. We received let
ters from two ladles over a year ago, both of
whom, I understand, he had been engaged to,
but they acted wisely and found out all and
saved themselves.
I. N. Conklin is a lawful son-in-law of mine,
having a wife (my daughter Grace) and three
children ! alive, and living with me. where
they have been ever since the desertion of her,
now over four years ago. He left her In Al
toona. Fa. At that time with a baby only four
weeks old, he had been leading a double life,
the effects of which he carried with him and
made him leave, fearing exposure to bis rela
tives and friends. Therefore, although the nup
tials were legally solemnized, the wedding and
marriage is not lawful, which he will find out
to his sorrow and reap the retribution due him
for his actions. I have kept track of him ever
since he left, and will keep track of him, not
that we respect him or wish him back, but to
let him know that he can't act in this way and
evade the law.
Mrs. E. Gernreich, Oakland, Cal. â Dear
Madam: I beg your pardon for thus address

very delicate subject that vitally, concerns your
self and daughter. My only object In so doing
Is to save you and yours from deeper sorrow
and further disgrace. To-day's mall brought
me and my daughter (Mrs. I. N. Conklin) three
communications relative to your daughter's
marriage on December 6. 1901, to one I. N.
Conklin. Two of these have Inclosed clippings
giving an account of the wedding with both
portraits attached, and further that the "Sol
dier boy abandoned his trip to his own State
and decided to stay where he is," which was
for his own good, for he dared not return. Now.
my friends, I take it from the account' cf the
wedding that you are well thought of and a>
family of good standing. Therefore I will givÂ«
you solid facts In this matter.
Conklin's arrest followed the receipt of
a letter from the father of Conklin'a
Pennsylvania wife. The letter, which Is
self-explanatory, is as follows:
The announcement of his wedding at
tracted the attention of a girl who had
refused to marry him after investigating
his record. She notified the Chief of po
lice, who in turn informed Mrs. E. Gern
reich, the mother of Mrs. Conklin No. 2.
Conklin came to California with the
Tenth Pennsylvania Volunteers and
served with that organization in the Phil
ippines. After receiving his discharge he
settled in San Francisco and, according
to the testimony in the hands of Chief of
Police Hodgkins, -has been trying to mar
ry somebody ever since he settled on the
coast.
, Conklin was married in this city on De
cember 6 to Miss Elizabeth H. Gernreich.
It is now alleged that he already had
a wife and three children whom he de
serted several years ago in Pennsylvania.
I. N. Conklin, a motorman in the era

Mrs. Lyndall was picked up by a stran
ger. She told him her name, but declared
that she lived in Santa Clara. He aroused
Mrs. Schneider, who had difficulty in be
lieving that the sorely crippled form was
that of her mother' she had tucked in
bed a few hours previously.
Dr. Edward R. Sill was called in and
everything possible done for the injured
woman. Her right hip was fractured
and serious internal injury sustained. 1
Sho retained consciousness, however, un
til this morning, when she died.
Mrs. Lyndall has. not resided in Santa
Clara for more than thirty years. The
shock of the fatal fair rendered blank
the interval since leaving there, and she
died under the impression that she was
still in Santa Clara among the friends of
thirty years ago. .
She was a native of New York. She
leaves a daughter, with whom she lived,
and a son, C. P. Lyndall, who is in the
insurance business in Los Angeles. Her
husband was killed in an accident at
Union City some twenty years ago.
When picked up, probably about two
hours after falling, she had clutched in
her hand one of the pillows from her bed
and was feeling about for the covers and
complaining of the cold. i Â¦
Deceased was a widow and lived , with
her daughter, Mrs. J. H. Schneider, at
611 East Fifteenth street. The old lady
i:as been ailing for some time and her
mental faculties were considerably im

required -constant watching.'
She was seen safely to bed on Monday
evening, but evidently arose during the
night and. lost her bearings in the darjj

fell was open only about eighteen inches.

"The trouble started with an inflamma
tion of the ear," said Dr. Chamberlain,
"and spread to the mastoid cells that are
beneath the bone, immediately behind
the ear. It was necessary to open these
in order to relieve the patient of the pos
sibility of the inflammation spreading to
the brain. There will . be danger from
complications until these cells are thor
oughly healed." .
Dr. Chamberlain, the attending physi
cian, said late to-night that Mrs. Booth-
Tucker was resting easily and that she
had rallied from the shock following the
operation. He expressed the opinion
that the chances of recovery were in
her favor.
Consul Tucker was first overtaken by Ill
ness just after her arrival on Saturday
last. She suffered- from a severe earache,
but did not think it necessary to consult a
physician until the pain became so great
that she could not stand it any longer.
Dr. Chamberlain, to whom she then went,
found that an absceSs was forming in the
ear. . He lanced the abscess at the home of
Colonel French in East Oakland, but lit
tle relief was afforded the patient. As she
continued to suffer Dr. Chamberlain ad
vised her to submit t6 an operation.
So serious is Consul Tucker's health that
her husband has been sent for and he is
now on his way from the headquarters of
the Salvation Army in New York.
.While the operation was successful and
the doctors are hopeful, the strain on the
sick woman's health has been very great
and she is now in a much weakened con
dition. She is not deemed in robust health
under ordinary circumstances and her
condition is such now that the slightest
change one way or another means life or
death.
Consul Booth-Tucker of tne Salvation
Army lies critically ill at the Fabiola Hos
pital as a result of an operation that was
performed for an abscess of the ear. Dr.
N. H. Chamberlain, assisted by other phy
sicians, treated the patient this morning
at the hospital by making an incision back
of -the affected ear and removing the ob
struction that has been causing her to suf
fer the most excruciating pain since her
arrival in Oakland last Saturday.

It has been decided to take up Cuban
reciprocity immediately after Congress re
assembles next week. No bill has yet
been framed and the question will not
take this form until hearings have been
held and all shades of opinion expressed.
It is 'the intention of the committee to
have protracted hearings open to all peo
ple interested in the question of the
sugar and tobacco tariffs. The majority
of the Republican' members of the Way3
and -Means Committee are still opposed
to lowering the rates on Cuban products,
but the administration, represented in this
matter by Secretary Root, Is still insist

once for the alleged relief of , the people of

will be brought in, but just what form
it will take no one on the committee can

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Jan. 2.â It is thought
that the Senate and House are quite likely
to get into a deadlock on the Philippine
tariff bill. Many well-known Senate lead
ers are In favor of scaling down the rates
on goods 1 coming from the Philippines to
this country and when the bill comes out
of the upper branch it is altogether prob
able that it- will be a different measure
from what it is now.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Charles H. Scherrer, former Mayor of
Brooklyn, who was a delegate "of the
Chamber of Commerce to the reciprocity
convention at Washington, said he ob
jected to any reflection being cast upon
that convention. He eaid in part:
The men who composed that convention were
the very men -who were responsible for the
great prosperity of the country. We canno*
compete with foreign countries because of the
quality of poods we manufacture. So long as
wp have the Fystem of protection we can em
ploy skilled labor, which makes our poods
what they are. If the duty is taken off we
will have to cease employing the skilled me
chanics and employ the ordinary laborer and
when that is done the present high standard
of o-jr manufactures will be gone. You can
not adopt this report without casting a reflec
tion on that convention and on the country at
large.
The following substitute for the report
of the committee was offered, but was re
jected:
Resolved. That this body does not recom
mend reciprocity in our trade with foreign
countries until it can be done without injur
ing any of our own products and manufactures.
The committee report and resolutions
were then adopted.
Gustave H. Schwab, chairman of the
committee on foreign commerce, support
ed the resolutions, saying he thought the
injury which would be done to certain in
dustries by reciprocity was eo small com
rared to the great good which would re
sult to the country at large as to be not
worth considering.

interests of manufacturing, commerce or farm-
IE*, thereby rendering Â£iiy application of re
ciprocal tariff concessions impracticable; and
Whereas, The National Reciprocity Conven
tion in a second resolution recommended the es
tablishment of a new committee to which shall
be referred the consideration of all reciprocal
trade agreements, thereby nullifying and dis
' 6Â»rding e the valuable and beneficial work
successfully accomplished by the present com
missioner plenipotentiary in the negotiatioa
of important treaties whereby a great part of
the trade of these countries would be thrown
open to us; therefore, be it
Resolved. That this chamber hereby ex
presses its disapproval of the action taken bv
the National Reciprocity Convention in Wash
ington on November ae subversive of all at
tempts to bring about closer trade relations
w.th our sister nations, and to open new and
wider markets for our products; and be it fur-
Resolved, That the chamber viewe with ap
prehension the policy advocated by the reci
procity convention as likely to invite hostile
legislationjon the part of other nations to thi<=
country to 1 the great detriment of its commer
cial interests.

;^ * COURT IS INCREASING
;Cases Within the Next Two or
: -. \ . . Three Tears.
Justices May, Catch. TJp With the
During the year 1901 the Supreme Court
decided 701 cases in which written opinions
were delivered. %'This is the largest num
ber of such cases decided for several
years. This number does not include the
vast number of decisions on motions, peti
tions for original writs, petitions for hear
ings in \bank: after decisions in department
and for rehearings after decisions in bank,
etc.". in "Which written opinions are not re-
Quired and I were not delivered. ;
During 1901 there were filed in the clerk's
office' C23 , -transcripts t on appeal, so that
the net gain for the year was seventy-nine
cases.' The general, business of 'the court
is behind in the San.- Francisco district' a
little less than two years; in' the Los An
geles district one year, and in the Sac
ramento district a little less than one
year. Thereforeif the gain for the last

Colonel Dudley Evans of New York was
elected acting, president of the '.â¢WeHs-

'he; would, be chosen as the head of;tha
corporation was exclusively announced in
The'. Call; last Monday;
Â¦ â¢ That Colonel j Evans was elected acting
president and J not president', at the meet
ing, yesterday 'was due solely to courtesy
to the stockholders' of .the â¢corporation.
The annual â¢ meeting of . the stockholders
will be. held in August, when a new board
of directors will be elected, and the' new
board will then proceed . to elect a presl
dent-and other officers of the 'â¢ company.
As between 90 and 95 per cent of the stock
is held in the East,- and as Colonel Evans
is an 'Eastern man, it is reasonable to sup
pose he will be chosen-'as the permanent
head of the corporation.
- E. H.' Harriman was elected a member
of the board of directors yesterday, and
it is known that he made a request to all
the ' members of the board 'Â« that , Colonel
Evans be made acting 'president, so that
he would be well in harness when the reg

: There were rumors to the ertect ' that
E. H. Harriman had his ' name proposed
as ; a -'member of the board of directors
as a stepping-stone to some day being
president. . Tnese . reports are erroneous.
Harriman does not wish the position, and

Secretary N. Stein at the close of the

. Colonel Dudley . Evans' . claims were brought
forward and he was elected, at once. The
meeting: and. election were' most ; harmonious.
The new. acting ; president , is a very capable
man. ' Of course, .with the death of President

Last . evening Colonel , Evans was seen,
but to all questions in regard to his fu

Colonel Dudley Evans has -been .the

in the Confederate army during the Civil.
War, retiring with the rank of colonel.

will make his; appearance- next
Monday night in a leading part -
In "The "Wife." Osbournehas not played
in this city for two and a half years. 'He
has been under the management of "Wll

Hur." ,
Osbourne Intended retiring from the
stage and devoting- his leisure to the cul-'
tivation of his vineyard at | Fresno. He,
however, was induced by Manager Fred
Belasco to rejoin the local stock company.
This will surely be gratifying news to
local theater-goers. Mr. Osbourne has
long been a prime favorite. : His sterling
acting In the past has earned him the re
gard and applause of the residents of this
city and vicinity. -
Mr. Osbourne looks younger than he did
when he left here some years agro to create,
the part of the Indian in "A Stranger' In
a Strange Land." He scored quite a hit
in this role. Later he joined Mrs. Lang
try and scored a success in "Lovers'
Lane," and duplicated it in "His Ma
jesty." : y<;
According: to Osbourne,. his \ old-time
theatrical partner, L. R. Stockwell; is
coining money with" an elaborate produc-.
tion of "Uncle .Tom's Cabin." â¢ His former
wife, Ethel Brandon, who was a favorite
In this city many years ago, is with Nat
Goodwin.- Mr. . Osbourne also states that ..'
Alleged Lack of Discipline.
Director G. Pouchan. who is a member
of the hospital committee and conversant
with the facts, made the following state
ment last nlKhti^v.'y
â¢ Miss Kirkpatrick' b charges are baseless She
was not dismissed for political reasons as she
seems to think. The fact was that her resigna
tion was demanded because she failed to fill
the bill. She had no authority over the nurses
and we felt the need of securing a matron
whose commands would be obeyed by them
without question. Of her charges against the
nurses and Mooser I know absolutely nothing
If she was aware that Mooser was acting badly
at the hospital it was her duty to report it in
the proper way. This she did not do. I cannot
understand why Miss Kirkpatrick ehould make
such statements as are credited to her, unless
she is jealous of Miss Flemming, her succes
sor. None of the things alleged by her have
ever been brought to the attention of the com
mittee of which I am a member. Had such
, n Â«i ft** they woul <* not have been dis
missed without a rigid investigation.
Efforts were made to secure a statement
from Mooser last night, but he could not
b f # U . nd , at th Â£ h <wPital. It was reported
at that place that Mooser had departed on
a vacation of ten days. Other 'directors
say that- Miss Kirkpatrlck's statements
are so trivial that no official attention will
be raid to them. Dr. Marquis merely
laughs at the story and shrugs his shoul
ders. Thus the matter stands. â¢
1 never heard of the matters charted by
Miss Kirkpatrick until to-day. She was a good
nurse and save great satisfaction at the hospi
tal. During the time she served as matron It
developed that her discipline was not wljat It
should be. it | is not true that Dr. Marquis re
ported against her and demanded, her resigna
tion. That was done by the hospital committee
after a careful examination into the facts
Indeed, there was no trouble of any sort re
ported to the society. This is mere spitework
on Miss Kirkpatrlck's part. I can explain it on
no other theory.
.Miss Kirkpatrick now alleges that .she
was forced to resign- because she" had in
curred the enmity of Dr. Marquis, head
surgeon of the hospital. She claims that
this enmity had its origin in her* report to
him that various nurses and Dr. Mooser,
an interne, were conducting themselves
in a manner not to be tolerated In a decent
institution such as the French Hospital.
She demanded of Marquis that Mooser be
reproved for his conduct, but Marquis
sided with Mooser, and a few days after
ward demanded her resignation. This be
ing handed in and accepted, Miss Flem
ming was appointed her successor.
It Is further charg-'ed. by Miss Kirkpat
rick that there is too much politics in the
hospital and that she has faleln a victim
thereto. She says Marquis wanted a
berth for his friend, Miss Flemming, and
that he was searching for an excuse to
get rid of her. Consequently when she
reported the Irregular conduct of Mooser
with certain nurses Marquis took advan
tage of the opportunity of securing her
removal.
John M. Dupas, president of the French
Benevolent Society, last night declared
that Miss Kirkpatrlck's charges lacked
foundation- In discussing the matter he
said:
Was Forced to Resign.
tee decided that the best interests of the
hospital demanded a change of matrons,
and Miss Kirkpatrick was politely re
quested to resign. This she did about a
month ago ana was succeeded by' Miss
Flemming, who lately arrived in this city
from Canada, ;:â¢."'-
Kirkpatrick are unworthy of credence.
Miss Kirkpatrick was connected with
the hospital for about three years. A
month ago her resignation was demanded
by the hospital committee of the French
Benevolent Society, which manages the
institution. She had matriculated as
nurse .In Â¦ the hospital and was appointed
as matron about a year ago. She was a
companion of the nurses and this friend
ship, in the opinion of various members
of tne committee, riot only weakened her
authority over them, but impaired the ef

of discipline it engendered. The commit-
