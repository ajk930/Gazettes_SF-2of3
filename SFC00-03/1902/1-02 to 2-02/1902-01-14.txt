burger, who discounted the: forged salary
warrants drawn by Peter McGlade, helped
Mahony to make, his fight,, putting up
$3S50 through Phil Crimmins. In return
for .. their financial support Mahony,
through Crimmins, was to give them, the
privilege of ''shaving" the .salary war
rants of the deputy County Clerks. As
the percentage charged by the brokers is
3 per, cent a month to discount a" salary
warrant drawn on the city treasury, and
the sum of $72,600 was voteS last year by

Mahony placed his signature to the
document, which was witnessed by Greg
ory Vallero, a deputy county clerk,' and
Flood, two of. the men to be taken care of
by Mahony. i
Deane then called in Attorney John
Flood,., and to show his good v faith
Mahony instructed j Flood to draw
up a . document In -which* Mahony
promised, to make Deane his chief
deputy in case of .his, (Mahony's)
election, provided Deane would not seek
the nomination for County Clerk on thÂ«j
Republican ticket. So eager was v Mahoriy
to have Deane quit the contest that* he
further Instructed Flood to insert in the
document that he, Mahony, would : also
take care of four friends of Deane and
give them positions in the office of the
County Clerk.

When Mahony again approached Deane
and asked him to retire" in - his \ favor
Deane naturally asked Mahony why he
should give up the light. Mahony there
upon explained to Deane that he, Ma
hony, would secure the nomination for
County Clerk, with the assurance of the
assistance of Phil Crimmins and W. "F.

After the primaries were held. and the
Republican machine bosses, with the -aid
of Rainey and other Democratic machine
bosses, had shown their power, "Deane
realized that he stood but little chance of
being selected as candidate for County
Clerk on the Republican machine ticket.
Dsane was approached by Mahory and
was asked to retire In his favor, but
Deane did not see it in that light Deane
had made a good record while in office
and the Bar Association was ready to
commend him for his good work and in
dorse him for renomination.
When the recent campaign commenced,
W. A. Deane, who held the office of
County Clerk, was desirous of securing
renomination for the office on the Re
publican ticket. Mahony, who was a dep
uty clerk under Deane, was also anxious
to secure the nomination.
Asks Deane to Withdraw.
The investigation of the charges against
Mahony has given The Call proof that
Mahony was and is a mere puppet 'in the
hands of Bosses* Crimmins et al.', and be
hind them looms up the figure of Attorney
William F. Herrin and his henchman,
Jere Burke.
If Mayor Schmitz' desires to be fur
nished with the proof of the charges
against Mahony, The Call is ready to fur
nish them at any time.
The Call also charges Mahony with hav
ing borrowed money and promising as a re
turn to appoint a certain man to a posi
tion in the County Clerk's office.
Mahony not only signed his name to a
document promising positions as depu
ties in the event of his election as County
Clerk, but he also entered Into . a deal
with a firm of salary warrant brokers to
throw the patronage of his office through
Crimmins to them in return for financial
support, in his recent campaign. Â¦
If Mayor Schmitz Is prepared to uphold
the charter. The Call is ready to furnish
him with proof that County Clerk Bert
Mahony is totally unfit to hold office and
is guilty of offenses that warrant his re- %

ante-election pledges of appointments of
deputies, have resulted In startling dis
coveries as the result of investigations

arid Wallace lived in San Pedro, and the
former has a family residing there.
Olsen, with the hardiness of the Nor
wegian, Etlll clung to the wreck. Three
days after his companion â¢ had' disap
peared he was picked up a short distance
beyond the kelp of Goieta, about eight
miles north of this place, by a fisherman
named Valdez, in the employ of Captain
Larco of this city. He was more dead
than alive and could have lasted but a
lew hours longer. He was quickly
brought to this city, where Captain Larco
took him to his home and everything was
clone for hla comfort.
Captain Olsen Is Rescued.
After two weeks of suffering Wallace,
the weaker of the two men, crazed by
hunger and exhaustion, gave up the
struggle and quietly slipped into the sea.
As the hours went by and the two* un
fortunate me,n were slowly dying of
thirst and hunger the wreck drifted
-eround the islands with the average cur
rents and entered the channel. ' To
leave the hulk in their condition meant
suicide, and they clung to the water
logged craft and fought death.
Both men climbed on the hull and
drifted with the wreck, in the hope of
being picked up by .a passing vessel.
What little provisions they had were
swept away and they were without food
or drink. Time and again as the boat
drifted with the tide their hopes ran high
as they approached shore, only to give
way f. despair as the tide changed. At
other times they approached rocky prom
ontories, expecting to be dashed to pieces
at any moment. Once or twice they saw
a distant sail and did their best to attract
attention, but all of no avail.
Olren and "Wallace were engaged in the
crawfishing business for a San Pedro

Island. They had a good 37-foot gasoline
schooner, the Belle, in which they cruised
about the channel islands. Three weeks
age the two men left camp in their craft,
taking sufficient rations to last several
cajs, and went to the south of the Isl
ands. Seventeen days ago, according to
Oisen's story, they encountered a fearful
sea, which a much larger vessel could
not have withstood, and the launch was
capsized several miles from the nearest
point of land. She turned until she was

CARSON, Nev., Jan. 13.â In response t<
urgent appeals from Tonopah. the pneu
monia scourged mining camp. Secretarj
Lee of the State Board of Health left foJ
that place this morning to take actioi
on behalf of the State toward checking
the epidemic. The appeals from Tonopah
which came by telegraph, said that thÂ»
plague had got beyond control, and asked
that the State authorities send medlca.
"assistance 'at "once!
The situation In the mining camp la ap
palling. Â¦ During the past two weeks mori
than a score of persons have died anc
three times that number are ill. The epi
demic is of a most malignant type an<!
the victims expire after a few hours' Ill
ness. Medical men are unable to accoun 1
for the peculiar effect produced upon thÂ»
Invalids, whose lungs appear to be pierced
and lacerated as though by sharp mineral
atoms in the atmosphere. Few of thosi
so far afflicted have recovered, and It it
feared that the death list wilF continue tc
grow at an alarming rate.
The epidemic has caused a panic in thÂ«
camp and all stages are crowded wltt
men, women and children hurrying awaj
from the plague-stricken .spot. Report*
from Tonopah say that there are scarceij
enough well persons left to properly car.
for the sick and bury the dead. Betweer
the camp and the nearest railway sta
tion, forty miles distant, the road is con
stantly lined with miners and their fami
lies, hastening across country to escape
the death dealing epidemic. Some, un
able to engage conveyances, are traveling
on foot, carrying their belongings on theh
backs. Many did not even tarry Ions
enough to gather up more than their val
uables, leaving their household and othei
property to the mercy of thieves, should
any be hardy enough to visit the plaguÂ«
spot.'
The sanitation of the camp is said tc
be very bad, and to this fact Is due. in a
great measure, the rapid spread of the
disease. Dr. Lee is instructed to take im
mediate measures to correct this evil, a*
well as to recommend other steps to be
taken by the. State.
Among the recent victims of the epi
demic was a former District Attornsy of
Lander County, who had been In Tonopab
but a few days.
One of the messages asking for assist
ance which came to the State authorities
was, from Railway Superintendent OdcHe.
Oddie recently went to the mining camp
with several hundred pounds of disin
fectants, with which it was hoped to
check the progress of the epidemic.
the political reasons, Herrin would find 11
most valuable to have deputy Counts
Clerks beholden to him, so that he could
secure advance Information as to thÂ«
drawing, of jurors in the damage, libel
and other; suits wherein he "misrepre
sents" the Market street road and the
Southern Pacific Company.
With a man In office as County Clerk
who will protect the Interests of the public
and' not be dominated by a corrupt boss
and an attorney, - Herrin would, like
Othello, "find his occupation gone." 1
.While the storm and Is raging
in the office of the County Clerk, Mahony
keeps within doors and all Inquiries elicit
the answer that "Mr. Mahony is very
sick."
It is stated that : Mahony's ailment Is
what is known as "talkitis." He is suf
fering from a free. use of the vocal or
gans in making promises. to give out po
sitions in the County Clerk's office. The
only known cure for the ailment, accord
ing to records of previous cases, Is "retire
ment from public life ,for an indefinite
period." â¢
: Mahony _ is not likely to visit Butcher
town for some time to come,' for there are
lots of angry men in that district who de
sire to give the County Clerk a "heart to
heart talk." .
-When Mahony. was : making his cam
paign in Butchertown he ran across one
of the residents named Fitzpatrick. Fitz
patrick was 1 working in the Interests of
Dahlbender, who ran on the Democratic
ticket: for County Clerk. Â¦ Mahony, prom

deputy if he would work for him Instead
of for Dahlbender. â¢'

A document is in existence, signed by Mahony, in which he promised-to make ex-County Clerk W. A. Deane his chief deputy in consideration of Deane's withdrawal from the contest for nomination for County

VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 13.â Since the
heavy gales. of December 3 and 4 and. those
of December 25 and 26, news of the find

nothing has been learned of the identity
of the vessels that were destroy ea by the.
winter gales. It was known that some ot.
the wreckage wa3 from thÂ© lost collier

Highland Light, in all probability, con
tributed to the debris found on the west
erly jjortlon of the coast.
Now comes news from. Alberni, from
which point it was brought by the steam
er Queen City, of the finding of wreckage
from the upturned craft already reported,
with letters "L. Paint." Another dis
patch says the name of the upturned ves
sel was "Annie L. Paint.' *v Much wreck
age, has been found by "W. P. Daykin,
the lighthouse keeper at Carmanah Point,
and among that which has drifted into
the beaches contiguous to Carmanah is
some which bears the letters "L. Paint."
Included in this is a piece of the hatch
combings of the schooner, painted red,
with the tonnage marked on It, showing
that the lost vessel which had turned tur
tle during- the storm, was of seventy-five
tons.
Nothing has been heard anywhere along
the coast of the crew of the upturned
vessel, which was seen by the steamer
Queen City on her present trip. Coating
between Carmanah Point and Point
Renfrew, at the entrance, to the strait3.
Other wreckage, consfslingr of two doora,
three oars, one life preserver and a medi
cine chest, has been found near Neah
Bay.
Records of shipping, both Britisn and
American, and the lists of vessels owned
on the Pacific Coast include no schooner
or other small craft with the name "L.

than that of the sealing schooner Annie

STRANGE VESSEL
As stated in these dispatches last night,
Mary Loren* . . to-day, filed complaints
against those members of the Grand Jury
who failed to indict certain members of
the lynching party known . to have been
implicated in the murders on the night of
May 31. She has already sworn to one
complaint, charging them with the.mur
der of Calvin Hall, and in the complaint
filed to-day charges them with the murder
of Frank Hall. James Hall, Daniel Yantis
and Martin Wilson. - . -
The Grand Jury has held nine sessions. They
have raked and scraped every possible source
for evidence against the people of Lookout.
The methods of the trained head-hunters have
been combined with the arts of the faker and
the mountebank, and. yet they could or did not
find enough evidence to indict -the other eight
men. But Harrington deemed himself the bet
ter judge and held them for examination. The
fact of the matter is it begins to. look like
persecution rather than an earnest/ desire to
vindicate the law and punish those 'guilty of
a crime.
The action of the Grand Jury is rather puz
zling, hi so much as there was the same evi
dence - against all of the men, and Just how
a part of them could be Indicted and others ac
quitted we cannot understand, unless. Indeed,
there was a pull somewhere, and how;. Claude
Brown- and Sam Parks sot off with one Indict
ment, .while the others were held under five
counts, is also something of a mystery.
Referring to the fact that the Grand
Jury of Modoc County failed to return In
dictments against some of those residents
of this section who are known to have
taken an almost active part in the lynch
ing of Calvin Hall, his sons James and
Frank, Daniel Yantis and Martin Wilson,
the Alturas Plain Dealer will say:
Editor Launches an Opinion.
Spencer attempted to Introduce a boot
Into the evidence, asking Hutton if it was
the boot worn by Knox on the night of
the lynching, but the court refused to ad
mit the Question, saying It was next to
impossible for, any witness- to identify a
boot after so 'many months; that it was
possible that wear and tear would change
its appearance. Hutton had testified that
Knox had worn boots with extra heavy
soles and this testimony caused Raker to
leave the courtroom during the short re
cess, returning with the boot.
He said that Colburn had declared during
the walk from the school house to the ho
tel: â¢ "I'll soon get even with Dan Yan
tls." Isom Eades was credited with having
said- that he would soon "get even" with
the man who stole his barbed wire.
Trainmen are inclined to believe Ma
gTilre'B story fully and that lie averted
the worst passenger wreck of years on
the northern line. .
Shortly before midnight Maguire was
awakened by the heavy blows of a ham
mer. He could distinguish the figure of
a man working at the switch. The light
had been extinguished. Maguire watchel
the fellow drive the switch arm back with
the hammer and throw the track opeu.
Then he crawled out and called to the cu!>
prit. The latter dropped his hammer and
ran. His retreating foosteps seemed to
be joined by others in tuc darkness.
Maguire found the locks had been tam
pered with and then' broken and he sur
mised that the man must be a train
wrecker. He knew that the south-bound
Oregon express would come thundering
along in an hour, and, unable to fix the
switch himself, he set out at a run in the
direction from which the train would
come.
Maguire is a workingman in hard luck.
He told a straightforward story. He said
he was Â¦walking the track all day Sunday
and when night overtook him he found
a pile of - ties at the Soto switch and
crawled under them. .

he saved ,the south-bound Oregon express,
vrlth Its hundreds of sleeping passenger*,
from disaster at Soto, a switch a few
miles below Vina. At 1 o'clock this morn
ing Maguire, ' hatless and out of breath,
halted a special freight train as it left
Vina and declared that the Soto switch
was set for a wreck. A crew was sent on
the engine to the switch and found it wide
open. There were marks of a poorly fit
ting key on the lock, and this had been
supplemented by the use of a sledge. The
track had been forced out eo that a train
speeding along would have left the rails
and gone into the ditch.

Raker, ,who, Â¦ since the beginning: of .the
j trial of OTames -W. Brown, the alleged
j Lookout lyncher,.haÂ§..bQen a.thorri.in.tbe
. side of Superior Judge Harrington, was
to-day put out "of the case. Judge Har-.
ring'ton announced that it was impossible
'I to compel, the: lawyer to ; "act: anywhere
j near, iike'-a.-gentlemari," jj and, wearying
1 of the constant strife, he "finally ordered
Raker to withdraw,' ; ;:;.'Â¦ :
j the morning session 'John Hut
| ton was 5 twice ordered, from the witness
j stand! by. Judge Harrington on account
of the "ungentle'ftiahly; and unprofessional
Â¦ conduct" of Raker, as Judge Harrington
! put it, and shortly before the noon recess,
! after a. somewhat exciting debate,- Judge
j Harrington ordered Raker to cease the
cross-examination for refusing to obey
the order of the court as to his method
of framing questions. Spencer took up
the examination and his style of question
ing, was so subdued and quiet that the
change was restful to those in the court
. i after the fiery demeanor of Raker.
The defense asked that two witnesses,
J. O. Boothe and P. H. Harth of Grants
Pass, Or., be placed on the stand to tes
tify to the character of Brown. They' told
of his good reputation during his resi
dence in prants Pass from 1893 to 1896.
! Both gentlemen bore certificates as to!
j their own character from the Chief Jus- \
tice of the Supreme Court of Oregon, but
on objection by Assistant Attorney Gen- ;
eral Post for the prosecution Judge Har- [
Â¦ rington ruled, they be not admitted,, say
ing that "the reputation of the Chief Jus
tice of Oregon might be much worse than
that of the witnesses," and that his wprd
could have no weight as the reputations
of/the witnesses was not involved. The
court added that their "personal appear
once -stamped them as gentlemen."
Harrington Rebukes Baker.
Huttoh was recalled and Raker asked
him if Daniel >Miller had not been teach
ing him his lesson. An objection being
sustained Raker tried another tack, Post
-again objecting to Raker's disobedience;
of . the court's instructions. Judge Har- i
rin^ton said: . â¢ ...
â¢ "Objection sustained. Mr. Raker is not
j. the man who will obey the ruling of. the \
court if he can avoid it." Â¦ . * Â¦ Â¦' Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ -.
j Raker took an exception to the remarks
j of the court. . â¢
j Much time was spent going over the old
ground, many objections being made by
; the prosecution . and sustained. . Judge
(Harrington admonished Raker not to,
! "manufacture words." and the remark !
'Â¦ called forth an objection -from Judge Har- :
' ris, â¢ for . the defense. , Judge . Harrington ;
H interrupted the argument of . Judge Har- ;
a ris, which called forth a remark that the ;
"â¢ Judge Was old enough to know, better than
! to Interrupt, for which Harris j was or
j dered "put of the court.' .- . . â¢ Â¦ Â»" Â¦' .
I - When the case resumed Harris was
i again admitted. Raker asked the wit-
L ness if he had ever said he would help !
"in 'the lynching. Post objected that the
question had been answered many times.
Raker. said in argument: Z :.
"Ain't I entitled to show every word
he (Hutton) utters is false? "That every
Mme he opens his mouth he makes a cqn
trad'etion, and that he is being paid
for it?" - ' .
Hutton said that s he had testified .that
he had. said that he "guessed" he would
participate in the lynching. ' Raker again
sai'd Hutton had been working for , the
j prosecution for * months, being paid
I "You say that again," said the court,
j "and I will .order the witness from the
i stand." ' :
,! Hutton denied that he had ever tried to
induce any one to take a hand in the
lynching. In answer to Raker's ques
tioning he said . regarding the men
lynched: .
"They had never done me any wrong
and I was friendly with them."
Post again protested against the meth
od of asking questions, and Raker made
the claim that Post was making innnmer
able objections to delay the' case, where
! upon the court ordered Hutton from the
stand. Â¦
Judge .; Quotes Original Law. "ry
Hutton was recalled and Raker was ad
monished to get his evidence by direct
j questions and answers only.'
I "You are fishing for questions," said
Judge Harrington, "and the law says you
must not fish unless you have good bait."
Hutton then went over the ground from 4
the time he and Claude Morris sat on
Trowbridge's porch until they joined
Potter and Leventon. Judge , Harris
asked that the. court direct the witness
to look at the jury. Post objected, -and
! Harris, asked that a sack be. put over the
! witness' head and also over Post's.
Hutton was asked if he remembered the
! conversation between them when they
met. " Hutton said,. "No." Raker, de
clared this reply was in direct contradic
tion to what Hutton had Â«ald in his con
fession." 'A dispute followed- and Judge
Harrington became angry and ordered the
witness from the stand. Raker said tha^
they had not finished with the witness,
to whichi Harrington replied: **
VRaker, shut your mouth. I am sick
of , your ungentlemanly conduct on the
part of the defense." .
"Shall we call the next witness?
a^ked Post. Â¦ " :Â¦ Â¦ : Â¦'â¢
The question brought forth, a fiery pro
test Â¦ from Raker, and , the court; rising,
said, pointing his finger at Raker: . ;
"Mr. Spencer is attorney on record in
this case, and I will not stand this con
duct any more. I will put you put. of
the case." Â¦ \ ' V ,/.
t "J realize that a man can-shoot me If
S he' wants to," retorted Raker.
"No one spoke of shooting," said the
court. ' "Mr. Spencer can take the wit
ness and no, one else.
Spencer then took the witness. He put
questions In easily understood language.
Nothing of importance was brought- out
during the rest of .the morning sessions
Spencer's Tame Questioning. :
This afternoon's session was tiresome".
Spencer continued his cross-examination
of Hutton. i' His method lacked the Intri
cacies usually apparent In the procedure
of Raker. The examination was very
'slow and the conclusion Spencer desired
to reach was not evident. before the ad
journment. The session was Â¦ unusually
peaceful, objections being few and far be
Â¦ tween, and the unpleasant controversies
so ' frequent' when Raker was conducting
,' the examination were, almost ; entirely
i lacking. â¢ . â¢. - *, , Â¦ .>
Â¦ Hutton's ability as a witness was again
demonstrated, he answering most of the
i questions put to him clearly, but with his
usual "caution. â¢.*â¢*â¢', .â¢'
, Hutton : stated that the' town ; party of.

Representatives Cannon and McCall also

could be made without any injury to the

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.â It has been
decided by the leaders of the House that
a. material reduction in the war revenue,
if not an absolute repeal, can be made. A
Republican caucus on thlÂ» matter will be
held within two weeks, according to the
present programme. Chairman Payne of
the "Ways and Means Committee came to
Washington at the beginning of. the ses
sion with the intention of using his influ
ence to reduce the war revenue, but what
he could do in the matter he was then un
able to say. To-day, however, he ex
pressed a firm belief, that a majority of
the House would be in favor of a substan
tial reduction.

Dr. J. A. Frame, the cashier, also re

better time for the robbery couldÂ»not have
been chosen. The manager and his as

had been received during the day, and as
betting- on the last . race ceased at about
6:30 p. m., only the employes remained.
Jimmy Driscoll, an employe who did not
readily comply with the command to lie

with a revolver from one of the rob

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan. 13.-Two
young men of slight build, with hand
kerchiefs tied across th'e lower portion
of their faces, entered Harry B." Chick's
poolroom at 907 Baltimore avenue, a block
in the center of the city, at 7 o'clock to
night, and with drawn revolvers com
manded the proprietor, cashier and three
other employes who were in the place to
lie down on the floor, secured between
$1500 and $2500 and escaped. A third man,
supposed to be a confederate, but not
masked, guarded the entrance while the

COTJlTCIIi'S CUP IS NOW
OWNED BY MRS. BROWU
The first brace went down at 9:15. They
â¢were W. B. Coutts' black and white
pointer bitch Kenwood Rose, by Kris
Kringle- Plain Sister, handled by W. B.
Coutts, and Clinton E. Worden's black
white and tan dog Wade Earl, by Dave
'Earl- Accelerando, by J. E. Lu
cas. The dogs were put down in the dry
river bed, but birds were found in a field
& short distance away. They flushed
wild, and were marked down along the
bank, where Wade Earl afterward se^
cured two nice points. Rose was a . bit
unsteady, but worked with much vim,
and is altogether a snappy little pointer
that stays out well but is inclined to be
nervous and not thoroughly under con
trol. The dogs were up at S:55.
At 10:15 W. B. Coutts' liver and white
pointer dog Xed Funston, by Kris Krin
gle-Fiain Sister. handled by W. B.
Cour.s, and H. L. Betten'a white, black
and tan English setter bitch Rods Lark,
by Rodfield-Count's Diana, .handled by
Charles Babcock, were put down on the
birds scattered by the previous brace
a.nd showed nice work, although the
weather by this time was very warm.
The pclnter made two points and the
cetter one, both being stanch and eteady
to shot-up at 11:15.
The third brace were Stockdale kennels'
liver and -white pointer dog Cuba Jr., by
Cuba of Kenwood-Florida, handled by
R. M. Dodge, and H. L. Betten's orange
end white English 6etter dog Diana's
Rodfield, by Rodfleld-Counfe Diana,
handled by w. J. Stone. There was. much
Interest in this heat, on account of Cu
ba's winning in the Eastern circuit, and
the spectators were not disappointed In
seeing a splendid exhibition of speed and
range and thoroughly hunted ground.
Unfortunately, no birds were found. This
First Brace Is Let Down.
SANTA MARIA, Jan. 12.-The
nineteenth annual trial of the
Pacific Coast Field Trial Club
began here this morning. The
entry in the Derby was disap
pointing. Only seven of the entire num
ber paid the third forfeit, as agamat
twenty-one which paid the second for
feit. Death has played sad havoc among
the Derby nominees for this year, and
sickness has left gaps in the list.
W". Van Arsdale's Bell Boy, a prom
ising entry, was left behind -when Trainer
Babcock located at Santa Maria, while
Lady Jane, another entry, died suddenly
a few days ago. Lady Jane was the
property of Clinton E. "Worden. "Wor
sen also lost his all-age entry. Alberta,
which has left him only one Derby dog
out of the three good ones he had en
tered.
A very late start was made for the
trial grounds. The weather conditions
Â¦were unfavorable, being warm and with
out a breath of wind stirring up to 2
o'clock.
Cuba Jr., the winner, resembles his sire,
both in form and coloring and somewhat
in his actions in the field. Although he Is
much higher class in every particular
than Cuba of Kenwood, he is a 1 light
weight pointer and has a long, sweeping,
easy gait, that carries him over the
ground with great speed. He exhibits
splendid judgment in handling his birds
and Is altogether a brainy youngster. ~
Rod's Lark, winner of second, although
entered by H. L. Betten, is in the string
of W. W. -Van Arsdale, who has an op
tion on her. She is handsome and stylish,
carrying a splendid head, and shows to
good advantage, especially when on birds.
Ned Funston, winner of third, Is a very
small, compactly built and speedy pointer,
by.no means at his best at the present
time. A serious accident sustained during
his training laid him up for some weeks,
which was of great disadvantage to him.
Thorough training and finishing will
make him a dangerous competitor In any
company, and he should give a good ac
count of himself within the next year.
The all-age stake will begin to-morrow
morning, and the work wlll.be done on
the grounds where the Derby was fin
ished.

Diana's Rodfleld and Oakley's Pride
were cast off at 3 o'clock, and although
they were among scattered birds once or
twice they did not seem able to locate
them. Oakley's Pride pointed once., but
his handler was unable to raise the bird.
This was a long heat, the judge endeavor-
Ing to get the dogs to locate a good bevy,
but in this he was unsuccessful. The dogs
were ordered 'up at 3:45, and at 4 o'clock,
after some consultation with the mem
bers of the committee, the Judge an-
After luncheon a start was made for
new grounds, and about this time a pleas
ant breeze sprang up, and all conditions
were raore^avorable. The first brace in
the second series were Kenwood Rose and
Rod's Lark. They went down at 1:30, and
the work of each was an improvement
over that of the forenoon. The first point
was made by Rod's Lark on birds scat
tered by the spectators. This was followed
by a point by Rose. Although she was a
bit unsteady and the birds flushed before
the handler was ordered to . fire. Rose
made a stanch point, and was backed by
Lark, was much the steadier
throughout the trials. They were ordered
up at 2:15.
Ned Funston and Cuba Jr. went down
at 2:30, and gave the only satisfactory
exhibition of the day. The flrst point was
made by Cuba, which was followed by
Ned making an equally good one. Then
Cuba pointed again and Ned was called
up to back him. which he did in fine style.
Cuba gained two more points on singles,
one of which was backed, and he finished
with a splendid bevy find, which he point
ed through the fence, the birds being some
distance away and running. The brace
was ordered up at 2:55.

heat was run in the warmest part of the
day ar.d the dogs were well exhausted
when they returned to the wagons. They
were taken up at 11:40. .
Oakley's Pride, the b^e dog, was given
a try-cut, which was followed by an ad
journment for luncheon.' This ended the
first series. ,

Last evening the constable's condition
changed for the worse. The news spread
about* town and immediately steps were;
taken to organize a mob to. take. the negro'
from the County Jail and lynch him. .The
officers were alert, | however, ;; and tele
phoned to Carson for a specia\ train to

8 o'clock in the evening a conveyance left
the Jail with the negro, Sheriff Mclnnis

with all haste to the southern outskirts
of the town, where ;.\tne train was in
readiness.- Ten minutes after leavlng.the
jail the officers had Scott safely aboard
the train. Everything was done so quiet
ly and with such dispatch that; the coup
was not discovered until .the prisoner was
lodged in the State: Prison at 1 Carson. .

bility goes. I imagine. There would be

The offices of the Recorder, Sheriff and
County Clerk were recently taken from
the Jurisdiction of the Civil Service Com
mission under a decision of the Supreme
Court, which held that the offices named
iire county offices and their employes can
not be Kuojected to the civil service test-
Under tiiax decision the Civil Service
Commission abandoned ail examinations
scheduled for the County Clerk and
Sheriffs offices. The examination for
copyists in the Recorder's office had aJ
reaay been held and an appeal is pend
ing to determine whether the Supreme
Court decision . exempts deputies only in
the county offices. 1Â£ the court should so
hold, the commission would not lose au
ihoritv to hold examinations for copyisita
and olher classes of employes.
The county officials do not take much
stpek in the contention of the Civil Ser
vice Commission that it still exerts con
trol over tneir offices simply because one
c&se is on appeal. They hold that the de
cision of the Supreme Court has relieved
the county offices from the operations o*
the civil service provisicÂ«iÂ»s of the char
ier. On that account they resent any in
terference in their respective offices on
the part of the Civfl Service Commission.

And there were other instances of slmÂ«
liar elisions not to the betterment of the
text. Modjeska's Lady Macbeth' is an
artistic conception. It is not so masculine
as some of her successful
played it, but it is equally effective In its
more feminine method. The play is well 1
staged, with no waits between the acts

chargeB made against' Mahony I will be
compelled under the charter : to remove
him from office, j If I fail to do so I would

guilty as Mahony is alleged. to be."
â¢-.The power given to the Mayor under the
charter Is quite" clear, and Mahony can
be removed from office Immediately the
Mayor is "given the proofs of 'Mahony's

In- chapter..!, section 2, article - 4, the
power of the. Mayor, is "stated as follows:
- "When any official defalcation or willful
neglect of duty or official misconduct shall
come -to his knowledge he shall suspend
the delinquent officer or person from office
pending an official investigation."
Sections* 18 and 19 of article 17 read as

notified the Republican leaders that it will
hold the "machine" responsible for, the
actions of. Mahony and that it will make
the matter an issue in the next campaign.
Just what Is to become of Frank French
Is known to .worry Mahony considerably.
It is asserted that Mahony: relies upon
Governor Gage to help him out and that
the -man appointed at the behest of Boss

Herrin will be given the position of Har
bor Commissioner in place of Rudolph
Herold. J v * 'Â¦ Â¦ . , ' *Â¦ Â¦ : ' Â¦
To Dispose of Frank French.
Another Instance of double, dealing on
the part of Mahony is In the turning
down of Deputy County Clerk Isidor Erb.
With Erb, Mahony, one day during the
campaign, visited a man named Giona
i.onl, who dispenses "wet" goods on .Sixth
street, near Jesse. - â¢ ' ' ..,;
In a suave manner Mahony "touched.,
the Italian for a double eagle, promising
to repay the amount in a few days. Giona
toni asked Mahony if his friend Erb
would be reappointed a deputy in the
event of Mahony being elected.
"Of course I will appoint him,' was
Mahony's reply.
"All right." said Gionatoni. "If you
make him one of your deputies, we will
call It square about the twenty dollars."
Erb is out in the cold and Gionatoni
wonders when he will see the "twenty"
he loaned to Mahony.
Although Mahony .went on record to
make W. A. Deane his chief deputy, he
gave the office to Frank French, who was
a shipping * clerk for, a down-town busi
ness firm. Attorney Reardonsays that
Mahony will keep his promise >to appoint
Deane chief deputy, and that by the end
of the month French will be proved "in
competent, irrelevant and Immaterial,"
and that Deane's name will be. affixed to
a salary warrant as Chief Deputy County

Richard Golden's "Old Jed Prouty," pre
sented this week at' the Calltornla-Thea
ter, is deserving of more than hearty sup
port from the theater-goers of San Fran
cisco. Golden's delineation of the Yankee
from the State of Maine is rendered so
naturally and with so little effort thaf in
the strong but homely scenes in which the
play -abounds he is made the recipient of
hearty applause. Robert Craig, who im
personates Zack Wilcox, the"*- -harsh
voiced town crier in the play, has to sup
port a make-up that is most ridiculous,
but does it in such a thorough manner
that he has made himself a favorite. â¢

E. B. JEROME, chief
{T clerk and assistant custodian at
(L . the San Francisco Custom-house,
died this morning at 12:15 o'clock
at his Oakland home, after a long
Ulness. gÂ§&g "-.) â¢ ' >.'
Edward Baker -.Jerome, for thirty-four
years} a^f Customs at ith<r pprt
of 4 San j| Francisco,* ' was born in ':' Car
roll tori, Greene.' County, Illinois, January
7, -.1844. His father was Theodore F. Je
rome, a gentleman of Huguenot ancestry,
and his mother was a sister of Colonel E.
D. Baker of California, who was killed at
the head of his command at the .battle of
Balls Bluff/ on the Virginia side of .the
Potomac, October 21, 1861. Young Jerome,
who was then not quite 18 years old, was
a lieutenant and aid de camp on his un
cle's staff and was close at his side .when
he was struck. He caught him as he fell
and supported him in his arms as he ex
pired.
Jerome continued in active service until
1863, when he came out to California: Soon
after his arrival he "was appointed clerk
In the postofllce of this city and served for
four years with entire satisfaction to his
superiors. :'r Â¦ Â¦ ' * *
In 1867 he was appointed chief clerk at
the Custom-house by General John F.Mil
ler. and he held that position under each
and every successive administration from
that time until his death. ?
This was entirely due to his wonderful
Mr. Alsop was the hero and did excel
lent work in the part He had*just the
right happy-go-lucky accent, the dare
deviltry and Amadis de Gaul heroics. He
deservedly won much applause. He has
a pleasing voice " and, hummed his "Oh
Dear. What Can the Matter Be?" witli
happy effect. George Osbourne did well as
Kitel, and Marion Convere and Oza
Waldrop as Rosamond Kent and her
maid Dorothy filled the bill. The play
was enjoyed by a large audience. â¢
.After that it Is the usual series. of hair
breadth escapes, with wonderful wit on
one side and marvelous stupidity on the
other, but. the hero wins out and things
an come rightâ with a bumpâ at the end.
But there is something pleasing about the
play, a certain freshness, buoyancy, au
dacity, youthful absurdity that appeal.
There is a sparkle of genuine wit in the
lines occasionally, a good situation or
two, end in the first act at least somÂ«
inventiveness. But the construction is
childish and the play without a semblance
of historical reality. The characters of
Larry Kavanagh, Kitel and Rosamond
Kent are rather well drawn, but the oth
ers are all lay figures. *
cÂ»^b-^HERE Is something very pleasant-
I ly ridiculous about "For a White
I Rose," the new bill at the Alca-
II zar. "For a White Rose" is the
_ . Â¦ ,, newest thing, out In -romantic
plays. It is by one Owen Davis, a. former
student of Harvard. It is a story of he
roic youth and maiden fair, together with
a strong dash of the ogre element for con
trastâquite on the order of "Jack the
Giant Killer" and the other nice. Impos
sible hero, tales of , one's -youth. It is
framed in the time of the thirty years'
'War of the. Rosesâ though this Is quite as
immaterial as it would be to chalk out the
country * where the giant-killing Jack
hunted his large game â and concerns an
altogether attractive. Irish youth's adven
tures InJEngland. He has dispatches from
Ireland for the Earl of Warwick and is.
waylaid by the villainous Sir Giles Acton
and, his scoundrelly retainers. The first
act opens with Larry's capture by the
minf bns of the wicked Sir Giles. Then he
is prisoned in a hut, his dispatches (pre
tended) stolen from him and he is left
â¢under a guard that deserts its duty under
a. flfmsy excuse or two. But tne fair
maid now appears on the scene, and. Lar
ry sings "On, Dear, . What Can the Mat
ter. Be?" to attract her attention. She
responds with another verse and then goes
to the hut to see who sings. Naturally,
she releases the hero from nis unpleasant
predicaineut, and he takes the usual mean
advantage of the situation and makes
love to her. Then the minions return and
the fat's in the tire. " â¢ Â¦ - -
Zlahony to "Care for Friends.
Mahcny - last night- made the- following
statement over the telephone: ' .
"I have been suffering: from pleurisy,
but I am all right now. I will be down
town in the morning and be at my offlce
I will straighten everything out. Of
course I intend to take care of my friends
who helped me in my fight, but every one
else will be satisfied and things -will come
out all right. I can't say anything more
over the phone."
any appointed officer may be removed by
the Mayor for cause. The Mayor shall
appoint some person todischarge the du
ties of the offlce during the period of
such suspension.
"When the Mayor shall suspend any
elected officer he shall immediately no*
tify the Supervisors of such suspension
and" the '.cause thereof. ' If the board is
not in -session he shall immediately call
a session of the same In such manner as
shall, be provided .by ordinance. The
Mayor shall present written charges
against such suspended, officer to the
board and furnish a copy of the same to
said officer, who shall have the right to
appear with counsel before the board in
his defense. Â¦ Â»â¢Â¦ â¢* ;. . Â¦
"If _ fey -an affirmative vote of not le?s
than fourteen members of the Board of
Supervisors, taken by ayes and noes and
entered on its record, the action of "the
Mayor' is approved, then the suspended
officer shall thereby be removed from of
fice;, but If the action of the Mayor is
not approved, such . suspended officer
shall be immediately reinstated."
The charges made by The Call against
Mahony are more than sufficient to war
rant his removal from offlce, and his case
is covered. by the sections of the charter
quoted herewith. / - \
efficiency and entire mastery of all the
details and legal minutiae of the customs
service. He knew every law and every
amendment relating to the service and
every ruling as to construction made by
the department in Washington. In fact,
he was recognized as one of the best post
ed men In the service In the whole coun
try. Little wonder, therefore, that' each
successive Collector found it wise and
convenient to retain Jerome as his deputy.
It is related that when the Democrats
came into power and Wise was appointed
Collector for San Francisco E. W. Maslin
was selected. for Jerome's position. Has
lin. called at the office and Jerome very
courteously proceeded to explain to him
the multifarious duties that would .ha In^
cumbent upon him and some of the things
he would be expected to know. Af tec- a
time Maslin asked if there was no system
of indexes to which reference, could be
made when any point came up to be set
tled. Jerome significantly tapped his fin
ger on his forehead and replied -that there
was the only. index. Maslin had enough.
He took his departure and Mr. Wise ten
dered the appointment again to Jerome.
No official was ever more attentive to
duty than E. B. - Jerome. Coming, as he
did in his long course of service, into con
tact with large numbers of people of all
kinds and .under circumstances often
tending to produce ill feeling, it would
have been but natural If he had incurred
the ill will of some. Yet the contrary was
the case; always cool-headed and pleas
ant, he won .the respect, and affection of
all the business public as well as his asso
ciates In the office. " Â¦.â¢â¢-..
Mr.. Jerome resided In ' Oakland and
when his duties of the day were over was
very fond of taking his recreation on his
bicycle. His wife died a short time s-'nee

letters on; Muller's : body, to that- effect,
written to . him by the president of the
company. .Two. weeks before Christmas
of Ithat year I thrashed . Muller for lying
about me and he had me arrested and put
under bonds to keep the'peace. The. week
before Christmas 'Muller. came, up to me
in the hotel at Sierra City and started to
abuse me. - I knocked . him down and hp
rushed off to get' a warrant . for me, but
the Justice refused to issue. it' when he
learned that Muller, was the aggressor.
Phelan yesterday gave his version of the
tragic events that took place at that time
and made the following statement:.'. / :
- "As no work was being done Â¦ on the
mine the property - would revert : to r; the
Government when the year expired. I was
acting' as superintendent for the Hilda
mine, which was situated across the Yuba
River from where the 1 : Gold Ridge; mine
was. -Two week3 before Christmas, 189*5,
Paul Muller, ., the foreman of the Gold
Ridge mine, -spread ; malicious \ stories
about me. I had .been his friend from
the day I first met him at Vallejo Junc
tion; and had also . befriended Dan and
James O'Connor. ; I loaned them money
and gave them work under me when I
was of -the Gold Ridge
mine. When the directors got into a dis
pute Muller and the O'Connors went over
to the opposition and, lived on the mine
as. guards, being always armed -to tha
>teeth. Â¦ - i: Â¦ . Â¦Â¦ ". Â¦ . Â¦"Â¦-. Â¦'Â¦Â¦:Â¦..--. Â¦Â¦
Tells of Muller's Death.'
The fight was also carried on in the
Superior Courts of San Francisco. Phe
lan -and his friends had paid assess
ment on their stock and when they found
that the money, was voted as salary for
the president and secretary suits -â¢ were
filed and restraining orders secured. The
end of the litigation was that the Phelan
faction scored , a victory. Judgment was
given for the recovery of the assessment
money and Phelan and his friends pro
tected their stock by injunction of i the
court restraining the opposition from vot
ing to sell the stock for non-payment of
assessment, as had been threatened.
Shortly before Christmas, 1896, Phelan
determined that he would protect his in
terests and those who sided with hlni by
locating on the mine on the night the year
ended.
Dan O'Connor openly boasted that he
fired the giant powder at the orders of
those .who. were opposed to Phelan. and
statements were made that Phelan was
to have been included In-, the explosion, of
his house. . . ,:,-Â¦-< . . : . .
The buildings on the property were
blown up and the aevelopment tunnels
were wrecked with "giant powder, N the de
struction being performed by Dan
O'Connor, 'who afterward met his death
at Phelan's hands. , *. , Â¦ r
When the. big railroad- strike of 1S94
ended Fhelan left San Francisco with a
number of miners bound for the Sierra
County, mine, in which he was interested.
He was superintendent of the mine and
the prospects ahead . were bright, but
after ' some months a â¢ dispute arose
among the. stockholders and two factions
wore formed. Phelan and those who
sided with him accused the other faction
of fraudulent., dealings over a proposed
sale of the mine to an Eastern man; and
a deadlock ensued. The president of the
cqmpany, who was opposed to Phelan
and his friends, controlled the majority
of the directors, and .as a result all worn
on the mine was suspended.
Two Factions Were Formed.
It was while he was running the hotel
that Phelan first became connected with
the Gold Ridge Â¦ mine, purchasing an fn
terest therein, j Associated with Phelan
were well-known business men of San
Francisco. . ; -'

The Gold Ridge mine Is no longer in
existence, for the property Is now known
as the Middle Tuba mine, and a number
of prominent business men of San.Fran
cisco are interested with Phelan in devel

work was done on the mine before the
present winter set in and stopped opera

Juryman Pauling Kills Himself
"When I saw he was dead I took .his
pistol and went to Sierra City and gave
myself up. O'Connor'** pistol had three
empty shells in.lt and my rifle had but
one empty shell and both weapons were
given to the Sheriff.
'.'I was given a preliminary examination
and -was discharged .at Downievllle by
Judge Howe, who decided that- it was a
clear case of self-defense. To my great
surprise District Attorney ; Wehe had me
indicted by the Grand Jury. Â¦ I secured
Judge Soward -to defend me and later
learned that he was the brother-in-law
of Wehe. The local newspaper, up there
bitterly . assailed me and decided that I
was guilty of a cowardly murder. . The
editor* of that paper was a member of
the Grand Jury that indicted me and his
associate editor,' a lawyer, assisted the
District Attorney to presecute me. -
"The jury i was out many hours and
found me guilty of murder In the second
degree and recommended me to the mercy
of the court. If ;I was guilty., of killing
a man from ambush, as the prosecution
alleged, why should the jury recommend
me to mercy. and find me guilty of mur
der in the second degree? To kill a man
from ambush is a cowardly crime and
should be punished with death.
"The threats continued- and on October
19, 1897, I started for Sierra City to get
a warrant for. Dan O'Connor's arrest.' He
had told two men that day that he In
tended to kill me that night. I took my
rifle with me when I started out: At the
foot of the Hilda trail a shot suddenly
wentjright in front of my face. 1 could
not see where It came from. I jumped
around and then as a second shot was
fired I saw O'Connor. I dropped on. my
knees and fired at him with my rifle.- I
struck him on the left side of the neck
and the. bullet came out on the right side.

"Kane -told me of the threats and so
did hia parents., O'Cohnor told them that
he Intended â¢ to drop some giant | powder
down the chimney of my house by means
of a long pole and that he wanted young
Kane to quit the place as he did not want
to blow him up also.
"On July 4, 1897, Dan O'Connor told
Charles Kane that on the following day
he would have a funeral on the Middle
Yuba and 'that he intended to kill me. I
became tired- of these threats and de
termined to go over to Sierra City and
have O'Connor arrested and bound over
to keep the peace.
. The pleasant relations between Phelan
and Dan O'Connor lasted but a few
weeks. Phelan one day discovered that
Dan O'Connor was falsifying the time
books, and the foreman was called to ac
count. He was told that he ought -to bo
dismissed, but that for the. sake of friend
ship he could work as 'a miner. "
"Dan O'Connor, quit his position," said
Phelan yesterday, In talking over the
event that led to the killing of O'Connor
some months later.- "He left the mine
and went to live at the ford on the Middle
Yuba River, where I crossed almo3t every
day In going from the Hilda to the Gold
Ridge mine. He made threats to dozens
of people that he intended to kill me, and
these threats came to my ears. I was
afraid to go over the ford, fearing that
Dan O'Connor would keep his word and
kill me. He borrowed rifles from two peo
ple up there, and when they heard of his
threats they asked for the rifles back.
Phelan and his friends having a ' clear
title by location to the Gold Ridge prop
erty, commenced in 1897 to work. upon it.
Phelan was superintendent and. gave Dan
O'Connor a position as foreman and tirrle
keeper., . '. " Â¦ â¢ â¢ â¢ .

I called ' Jim O'Connor r a v.llar. He

I have serious doubts as to the correctness
rii the conclusion here declared, to the effect
that a Judgment of a Justice's or Police Court.
rendered within its jurisdiction, convicting a
defendant of a misdemeanor in effect will be
nullified and set- aside by a mere Judgment of
a Superior Court rendered thereafter convlct-
ItiE the same defendant of a felony. It seenu
to me that the judgment of a. Police Court.
rendered within its jurisdiction, has the same
effect, force and dignity as a judgment of a
Superior Court.
The Supreme Court upholds McGuire' s
contention and orders that he be sent to
Fuisom without further delay, but can
not see that he should be allowed to es
cape punishment for his crime. The
opinion was written by Chief Justice
Beatty. with whom Justices Van Dyke,
McFarland and Henshaw concurred.
Justice Garoutte, however, writes a
strongly dissenting opinion as follows:
The Supreme Court, in a decision ren
dered yesterday, established the prece
dent that a Judgment of a Superior Court
supersedes that .of a Justice's or Police
Court. It is contended, however, by Jus
tice Garoutte and other prominent mem
bers of the bar that the lower courts in
their own jurisdictions have equal forca
with the higher tribunals. No case of
ihe kind has ever previously been before
the courts of California, and since the
point in question was first raised the mat
ter has been the source of much specu
lation among the members of the legal
fraternity-
Late in June James McGulre was cap
tured la an attempt to burglarize a Mar
ket-street store. He was first arraigned
on a charge of carrying a concealed
Â¦weapon and upon conviction was sen
tenced to spend six months In the County
Jail. A. little more than a. month later
he was tried for the burglary and sen
tenced to three years at Foisom.
The law states that the sentence of a
Superior Court must be put into execu
tion within a period of forty days. Sher
iff Lackmann decided to keep McGuire
In the city until the expiration of the
minor sentence and then to take him to
Foisom. The prescribed â¢ limit of torty
days having elapsed, the prisoner's at
torneys petitioned for a writ of habeas
corpus on the ground that the law had
been disregarded by the Sheriff. Tney
contended also that the judgment of the
Superior Court had made that of the Pp
lice Court void.
A. C. Adams, a clerk living at 421 Bush
street, while walking on Hayes street,
above Larkin, about 5 o'clock yesterday
morning was approached by a masked
man, who. placed a revolver against his
abdomen and ordered him to throw up
his hands. Adams promptly complied with
the demand and the robber searched him.
but found nothing. The robber was about
5 feet 11 Inches tall and wore a white soft
bat and light overcoat.' Adams reported
the matter to the police yesterday.
Albin Peterson, known as the "Minne
apolis Kid.", was held to answer before
the Superior Court by Judge Cabaniss
yesterday on the charge of robbery, .in
$2000 bonds. On the morning of Decem
ber 29 W. H. Hanson, a lumber dealer
living at the Pendleton, 900 Sutter street,
while on his way home was attacked on
Geary street, near Powell, by two men,
who knocked him down and robbed: him
of his gold watch, valued at $150, and $100
In cash. Peterson was seen by two wit
nesses following Hanson along Geary
street and leaving the scene of the hold
up.
Judge Cabaniss did some expeditious
work yesterday with Edward Vaughan,
who appeared before him on>a charge of
robbery. About 5 o'clock last Sunday
morning Samuel McDonald, a machinist
living 'at 560 Howard street, was knocked
down and robbed by two men at Harriet
and Howard streets. His cries attracted
the attention of Policeman Fly nn, who
clubbed Vaughan end captured him. The
Judge, after hearing the evidence, held
Vaughan to answer before the- Superior
Court in $2030 bonds.
Jackson Williams, a colored man, was
convicted by a Jury In Judge Cook's court
yesterday on the charge Â¦ of robbery Â¦ and
will be sentenced this morning.' The
Judge jntima ted that In view of the num
erous hold-ups In the city, he would make
an example of Williams. On the morn-
Ing of December 7 Hairy Carlson, a sail
er, who had been drinking, was in a res
taurant on East street, when Williams
approached him j and suggested that he
should take him to his vessel. Carlson
consented, and when they got outside
Williams demanded 23 cents, which was
refused. He then knocked Carlson down
and took all his money from him.

1 Another Democrat who is fully . as astute as Hill
has taken a similar view of the situation of the party.
Mr. Gorman has "achieved the feat of recoveringhis
political power .in Maryland. He has recaptured the
Democracy of the State and through the instrumen
tality of the party has obtained possession of tfie Leg
islature. He*is once more in the" saddle with, all of his
old-time prestige, and perhaps with an increased
wisdom born of experience iii defeat-- It is noted that
The phrase in which Mr. Hill couched his advice
inevitably presents to the mind an .image of Democ
racy on skates, , with thin ice all round and many air
holes in sight. . It is time 'for slow skating and care
ful watching. ...Having gone down the toboggan
slide with disastrous results so. often, this is no time
for Democracy, to take risks on the icepond. A tum
ble just. now might mean a worse thing than befell
it during its" midsummer madness in 1892, when it
went wild in Chicago and nominated Bryan.
DAVID BENNETT HILL was recently visited
by a representative of Boston Democracy and
invited to go to that city some time this win-',

clined, and in doing so is reported-, to have said:
"We are in a peculiar position, at the present time,

ANSWERS.TO QUERIES.
PERSONAL MENTION.
The New York v Sun attacks the opponents of the
scheme by saying: "We note that the same argu
ments employed by certain local interests in this
country to prevent or at least to postpone the open
ing of our markets to Porto Rico's products are nojv
focused upon President Roosevelt's similar but not
identical plea in behalf of Cuba." The phrase "local
interests" was undoubtedly used by the Sun with the
intention of belittling the advocate of consistent, pro
tection. The phrase, however, recoils on the paper
that used it for that purpose. All American indus
tries are lccal interests in the sense in which the Sun
<tÂ«ed the words. If we are hot to protect our "local
â¢nterests" what are we to'protect? -In fact,' the only
plain duty that Congress, has in the matter is that of
piotecting our local interests, and, fortunately, it
iecms certain the Republican majority will faithfully
perform it. This isnoaime to tinker with the tariff.
The New York Tribune tries to further gloss over
the evil of the scheme by arguing that it is to be only
temporary. "A six months' arrangement," it says,
"is all that is now required â all, perhaps, that is' now
possible. . This country is not asked to commit it
self "irrevocably to a permanent policy. It is asked
merely to give a living market to the people who are
now under its absolute control until such time as they
can make their own negotiations for a market" Such
a plea is likely to' be effective only with those who do
not stop long enough to reflect that if free admission
to ourjriarkets be once granted to Cuban producers
its continuance will.be urged on the ground that we
have encouraged capital to invest in Cuban enter
prises and are morally bound to maintain the condi
tions under which the investments were made.
When the.agitatfon for reciprocity with Cuba began
it was supported by economic as well as by sentimen- !
tal arguments. It did not take long, however, for
stanch protectionists to refute the economic pleadings
of the schemers and to expose the fallacy of their as
sertions. Of late the plea has been made almost
wholly on sentimental grounds,, and it is. that fact
which enables Republican papers to sustain it with
some show of consistency. They admit, that' to re
duce duties on sugar and tobacco from Cuba would
injure the domestic industries engaged in the produc
tion of those articles, but they plead that we should
submit to the wrong in order to benefit Cuba. They
repeat over and over again that it is "our plain duty"
to make Cuba prosperous by giving her products free
admission to our markets.
CHAIRMAN PAYNE of the Ways and Means.
Committee is reported to have said the House
will probably take up the question of Cuban
reciprocity first of all important measures, giving it â¢
precedence even over the reduction oi war takes.
Further reports assert that the 'Republican majority in
Congress will stand firmly, by therprotective, sysjern
and defeat the reciprocity scheme. It is evident, how
ever, from the vigor with which the fight is being
made by the press of the larger cities in the East, that
the schemers who seek to break down' protection are
not going to give up without a hard struggle.
That tht Democratic free-trade press should sup
port the Cuban scheme is not surprising. Reciprocity
such as that proposed in this case would be a. triumph
over the protective principle. It would destroy that
uniformity of protection now given to American in
dustry, and would inevitably- lead to demands for fur
ther reciprocity. Moreover, it would force the pro-,
tectionists to undertake to defend the illogical' and
unjust doctrine that some industries should be sac
rificed to make a foreign market for others. It is
surprising, however, to find Republican papers sup
porting the scheme, "and 'yet ' many of them are-:
doing so. . .

Such are some of the decrees with which the Dow
ager Empress resumes her government. It can hardly
be doubted that she sincerely desires to increase the
wealth," the strength and the independence of China.
The disasters of the past few. years seem to have
taught her. at last that she must learn from the west.
It is quite possible, therefore, that this woman," who
has risen from the position of a captive slave' girl to
be Empress; of the most populous empire in the world,
may yet prove to be in her old age a reformer equal
to any in history. \
Two decrees deal with the .subject of education."
They provide that less time be given to the study of
the 'ancient classics and more to the acquirement of
useful knowledge. .One decree says: "Human talent
lies at. the foundation of all affairs, and In the culti-.
vation of talent the most important thing is the im
provement of educational methods. * * * Let
earnest efforts be made to inform the mind, to secure
upright conduct, to improve both literary, talents and
character, and to produce men acquainted with the
times and diligent in the pursuit of real usefulness."
The other edict, dealing with students who go abroad
to study foreign methods, says: "Let them acquire
a thorough mastery of some profession and genuinely
exert themselves in the pursuit of useful knowledge."
The administrators of the provinces are exhorted
to bear in mind that "the old customs of the empire
were good, but having been, in operation for a long
time a great many abuses and obstructions have
grown up." They are instructed "to abandon a slav
ish adherence to precedent, Â¦: but to be careful to
choose of the new only what is good." Then follows
the announcement: "The object of the establishment
of the Board of Administration is to promote the in
dependence of China. Â¦ /China's weakness. is due to her
poverty; "The strength of foreign nations is due to
their wealth. Deliverance from poverty,, therefore, is
the very beginning. and foundation of independence.
But the commencement of .reform ought not- by 'any
means to' wait. upon the attainment of wealth." ;
Whatever may. be;her ! secret designs, the official de
crees issued by: the; Government of the Dowagerj
promise well to China and-to the world. The current Â¦
number of Consular Reports is devoted largely to
Chinese affairs, and ; among other official documents .
gives translations of decrees of the Empress^relating
to government and to education. One. of the edicts
takes the control of the general affairs of the country
out of the hands of the Grand Council and vests it in
a department known as "The Board of National Ad
ministration.? To the. new board 'elaborate instruc-'
tion s are given as to means and methods of effecting
reforms. The members are told: "To combine Chi
nese and western ideas and harmonize them will be
very proper. This is important. Legislation must
not be rash, else it Â¦ cannot be carried on. This indi
cates how ,we should proceed."
It is reported that on her arrival at the capital -the
Dowager Empress appeared 'to ; be humiliated -and;
looked appealingly to: the foreign Ministers as if
pleading to them for commiseration. If she had any
fears they were quickly . dissipated, for on :': the -very
next day she held' an audience in the most; sacred V
hall. of the palace, an apartment which never before =
had been entered byi; a woman. The act was, signifi- .
cant of her courage and' of her* determination to im
press upon the.Chinese mind that she has lost noth
ing in dignity by.* retiring from the capital before the
advance of the foreigner. ... ... .,,ââ¢' v " 1 "

;Empress,i has 'returned to ; the, capital and re

struggle growing put of the uprising of the 'Boxers â¢
is closed. It remains to be seen it will prove
but an episode in Chinese history, .or -the
â¢point 'of a new' epoch.: In: determining that issue" no'
other personal influence will-.count for half so much
as that of the old woman who- has once more grasped /

If we had large-sized politics in this State this sit
uation would call out an exhibition of statesmanship.
The next Legislature must dear with this subject. !
The State now relies on a commission that is no
longer a good scarecrow.- The railroads know that it
is only a pair of old trousers and a shirt on a forked
stick. They pay no attention to it, except to prolong
the useless proceedings which it institutes, because
they figure. in the programme of delay which is the
policy of the corporations. The/commission, has had
a judicial death and, awaits legislative burial.. In its
place should be .some system in the form of ' a
tribunal of first, instance, with a defined appeal which
cuts out intermediate courts and gets promptly into
the final tribunal. The millennium is no doubt on
the way, but has not arrived, and until it comes
transportation companies are going to need regula
tion as to rates and equality of charge for equal ser
vice..- Over these acts issues will continue to arise
and should go to trial in a judicial body and not be
fore a nullity. f > ....
We are not disposed to attack the railroads for
availing themselves of their legal right. Indeed, that
they do so may favorably affect the future, by letting
the people see plainly that their Railroad Commission
is a non-legal, unconstitutional body, without power
to enforce the simplest of its orders.
The railroads get advantage of the long investiga-'
tion by the commission, and then that of the long
judicial investigation^by the courts, and at the end of
it, if anything is left of the. oil business, it will have
survived only to hear that the California Railroad
Commission has no power to enforce any decision
it may. make. ' ".
It is necessary that this be known. '-For. that rea
son* we put it in its most positive form. The commis
sion has fixed an qil^ate, believed by those engaged
in that industry, to be necessary to the very existence
of their business, . The matter has been long on trial.
The' commission gave ! to it patient investigation.
But no. sooner is the order of a new rate entered than
the State and Federal courts .explode with injunc
tions and restraining orders, which demonstrate that
the commission has no more legal vigor than the
poncho of an Alcalde of Pueblo of bur pre-Gringo
days. . - - . . â¢ '
We have not the least doubt that either proceedings
oil a quo warranto, or by" injunction against the State
Treasurer and Controller, restraining the payment of.
the Commissioners' salaries, would demonstrate that
their office has no legal existence.
We believe that any citizen of California can by
quo warranto terminate the Railroad Commission.
When commanded to show its right to hold office and
draw pay, that commission must declare its authority;
as a derivative of a provision in our State constitution
that has been nullified by the Supreme Court of the
United States. ' â¢
; It will be observed that these decisions practically
nullify that part of our State constitution which cre
ates a Railroad Commission and- defines" its duties.
The constitution requires that the Commissioners fix
rates, and that when so. fixed they must be accepted
as just and right. In fixing rates the commission may
or may not inquire into conditions, and may proceed
without investigation if it choose. But, whether
based on inquiry, as in the case of the oil rate, or at
tempted arbitrarily, like the many horizontal cuts that
have been proposed and have figured in our politics,
the act of this commission is without vigor or, effect.
It is not even necessary for a common carrier to take
the precaution observed by the Santa Fe line and de r
dare in its reports to this commission that it is a
foreign corporation. That is not necessary to raise
a Federal question and get shelter in the - Federal
courts. The sole issue is a Federal issue, radical in
the Federal and a local stage line in this
State carrying passengers any distance* within the
State has the same .right, ot resort to the Federal
courts as an overland road run by a foreign corpora
tion and carrying interstate commerce.
Only one' of the ' early Railroad Commissions
seemed -to. see "in its duty a judicial function purely.
The Iowa commission from its beginning took to it
self Judicial' power? and was probably the most use
ful body of the kind in. the United States. . But there
has been an. evolution of law on the subject/What
cne commission saw nearly jtwenty-five yerira ago "has
now become the settled law of the land by decisions
of the Supreme Court of the United States. In the
Minnesota and Texas cases that bench has decided
that the fixing of transportation rates is dealing with
the rights of property through its use, and, that' as
the Federal constitution declares that no one can be
deprived of property without due process of law,
there js but one "process of law," and that judicial.
Therefore ; Legislatures . cannot - fix transportation
rates, nor can they delegate that power to a subordi
nate body to be exercised as a legislative or executive
function. The process must be judicial. â¢
THE present Railroad Commission : was provided
for in the. new constitution. In 1878, wheij that
. .instrument was projected, the theory and prac
tice .were general that a corporation,- such. as a
mon carrier^ was. subject to legislative and executive
control in respect 1 'to its rateV and all other matters
needful of oversight in the interest of the public.
That was the first position taken after the Dartmouth
College 'decision was held to be inapplicable to such
corporations, and the power that granted their fran
chises was held capable of. amending them.
A USELESS COMMISSION.

Corporal Frazier said that Damschrocler
is only 18 years of age and recently,
through the death of his father, had
fallen heir to $50,000, which made him anx
ious to regain his liberty.
Corporal G. P. Frazier called at police
headquarters yesterday to take Holt and
E. P. Timmons,' the ex-soldier who is
believed to have assisted Holt In making
his escape, back to the island. Crockett
and Hamill informed him that Rhea was
living at 88 Third street, and he went
there accompanied by the detectives. Fra
zier at once identified Rhea as Vincent,
who was supposed to ha.ve been drowned,
and he was promptly placed under arrest
and taken to the island along with Holt
and Timmons. (3 â¢
The authorities on the island ascer
tained a few days ago that Theodore'
Damschroder, a boy" soldier who is serv
ing five years for cruelty to a Filipino,
was receiving notes from a man in the
city, signing himself as Harry Rhea, who
urged the lad to make his escape. The
police were communicated with and De
tectives Crockett and Hamill learned that
Rhea was living at SS Third street, where
Frank H. Holt, the soldier who escaped
in a box from -the island Saturday morn
ing and was recaptured by the detectives
Sunday, had also been rooming.
Al Vincent, a soldier who was serving
a two years' sentence on Alcatraz Island
fqr larceny, jumped from the Government
steamer General McDowell about two
weeks ago while it was on the way from
the Presidio wharf to the island.- As the
vessel was a considerable distance from
landlt was thought that Vincent could
not possibly swim ashore, and must have
been drowned. Â»

-Possibly. the trade of this port'haa been
bartered off 'In this way by the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company. Such a policy
would not be new. The public Btlll re
members the' old arrangement by which
trade was tied up by this same line, act
ing with the" transcontinental carriers, by
way of; the Isthmus route between San
Francisco and New York. Whatever the
causes may be that have made the Pacific
Mail .hang back in the matter of giving
this port^a direct service to the Philip
pines, the fact is that. the situation is up
to that* corporation for justification of Its
course If Hill gets what he is after, to the
detriment of this port. -
No direct answer was ever returned to
this proposition^ By insinuation < it was
made current that the Pacific Mall Steam,
ship Company could not engage in carry
ing, freights between Manila 'and Hong
kong, because, it was alleged, the agree
ments with the coast lines of steamers
engaged! in the Straits and other trade,
which acted as . feeders to . the' 1 Pacific
Mall, prevented such service as was asked
for by the San Francisco shippers.. . -,
"No Answer Given.
This was all bad enough, but there may
be worse to come. If Hill gets away with
the large share of the business of the
Philippines it will not be very difficult to
trace the responsibility to the Pacific Mail
Steamship ! Company. The merchants of
this city waited upon Mr." Schwerin re
peatedly to get him to give them some
relief l in the Philippine trade. All they
wanted was to have the steamship com
pany carry their goods directly to the
Philippines, instead of taking them, to
Hongkong for reshipment. Time was con
sumed in. presenting the facts, and the
proposition was fairly understood by the
entire community. When Mr. Schwerln
told the merchants that his line could
not < run vessels direct to Manila because
there were no returning freights from Ma
nila to this country sufficient to fill up
his ships, the very simple expedient'was
presented, of having the steamers, or cer
tain of themâ enough to accommodate the
volume of. business moving forwardâ stpp
at Manila on the outward-bound voyage,
the distance ' from Hongkong to Manila
.being very short.
The overland roads made rates some
time ago, 1 to which attention was attract
ed by The Call at that period, which in
connection with the steamer rates from
San Francisco to all Oriental points and
'to the Philippines gave the Eastern mer
chants an advantage, which curtailed the
business of the merchants of San Fran
cisco very "materially in that direction.
About that time also it was discovered
by San . Francisco shippers, to their dis
gust and indignation, that the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company was filling up steam
ships of that line with goods shipped from
the East directly to the Orient and leav
ing the wares offered by the San Fran
cisco shippers upon-the wharf. The mer
chants had : the usual excuses offered to
tRem. In other words, they were given
the glad, hand and the Eastern people
were given the business of the Orient, so
far as it could be controlled by the car
riers. . " ' .
Work Against Port v
Hill, has no roads centering here. . His
business .on the Pacific . Coast is in the
north. , Therefore it is safe to say that
the success of Hill means so much taken
away from Bah Francisco. In this con
nection'there is some bitter talk to be
heard in . commercial : circles, because but
for the singular performances of the over
land carriers and their steamship allies,
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company par
ticularly, San Francisco could have had a
direct line to the â¢Philippines many
months ago. ... . .. .....

A well dressed woman, whose name the
police were unable to secure, jumped into
the bay yesterday morning from near the
coal bunkers on Folsom-street wharf No.
2. The cold water produced a sudden de
sire for a longer life, and when Police
man Sandman reached the end of the
dock, whither he had been attracted by
the splash and a subsequent scream, the
woman was clinging affectionately to a
pile. He assisted her to the dock and
telephoned to the police station for the
patrol wagon. Before the wagon arrived,
however, the woman gathered up her
skirts and disappeared up Folsom street.

NEW TORK. Jan. 13. â There was ' continued
leek of animation in the stock market to-day
end the dealings were palpably In the hands
of professional traders. The element was bear
ish In Its opinions on the outlook and sold
clocks <juite freely throughout the day. The
lfvel of prices was carried generally from 1
to 2 point* lower under last week's close. No
large amount of liquidation was brought out
by this considerable decline and there was a
movement to cover short* late In the day,
causing a rally of a point or over in some of
the most prominent clocks, but the recovery
Â«u practically all lost again berore the close,
which was extremely dull and heavy. There
Â¦was no striking news of a character unfavor
able to values, but It was obvious that any im
portant organized movement to lift the market
has been abandoned for the present. The
speculative element has been indulging the
hope that the great capitalists and syndicates
who have on their hands the heavy volume of
securities resulting from the combinations and
new formations of last year were about to put
forth a determined effort to lead a bull specu
lation, with the intention of making a market
for t&eir securities. Ko sign of any such at
tempt has appeared since the Â¦ publication last
week of the quarterly report of earnings by
the United States Steel Corporation. Hope of
Â«=uch leadership was still further discouraged
by rumors of the illness of the market operator
intrusted wlih the care and manipulation of
those clocks and by reports of unloading In his
interest. More tangible grounds of depression
were found in the formal offer of $30,000,000 of
Atchieon debenture" bonds to reimburse the
company for certain outlays, ~ Including ac
quired lines and equipment, which Wall street
has assumed had been or would be provided for
otherwise. Reports of very lÂ«rge projected out
lays for betterments by the Union Pacific
emphasized this influence. The permission
granted by the United States Supreme Court
for the Etate of Minnesota to argue on Its pe
tition to bring euit for the annulment of the
formation of the Northern Securities Company
although its force was little understood, had a
chilling effect on speculation owing to Its prom
lÂ«Â» of a prolonged legal Ftruptrle and delay In
the flotation of the company's securities
Money was. ellghtly firmer to-day and sterling
exchange Â«ra* no higher, but exports of gold
are expected to be made, this week. There Is
a growing feeling that even when money does
accumulate at this center it may not serve to
â¢simulate, speculation In the prevailing spirit
of pkeptlcJsm in the value of securities at
present price levels. â¢
The shading of prices of copper led to a sharp
raid in the late dealings in Amalgamated Cop
per, which helped to unsettle the close. Ex
ceptional movement* were made by.Lacka
wtnoa. which rose (i'A and lost most of lt.'Glu-

CHICAGO, Jan. lo. â At the , opening of the
wheat pit bulls took hope because the foreign
markets did not reflect the Saturday weak
ness. Liverpool was slightly lower, but grad
ually imriroved, and Paris was higher. Aug
menting this influence were the reports of de
creased shipments to Europe and a decreased
vifrlbl" supply, but these la turn were weak
ened by an increase of 1.1W.000 bushels In the
amount of breadstuff^ on paSiaâ¢e. May opened
Me to %c higher at 82%c to M2%c, and 1 . showed
some lendenc-r to break on liquidation. The
continued reports of dry weather and covering
by numerous thorts at the lowest early prices
brought a rally to the opening prices again.
For some time the market wavered between
the two opposing forces. Bulls were striving
to recain their control" of the market, but
the bear contingent was as determined not to
permit it. The general sentiment pervading
the pit to-day was that longs had held on to
their wheat too long In the attempt to push
prices still higher, and that the reaction had
not come in earnest. Toward the close of thr.
session selling orders came in rapidly. Bears
pounded the pit with the argument that there
was too much wheat to be had. May began
slipping down at a rapid rate. The decline
was arrested only by the close of the board,
when May jvas weak, %@lc lower, at 81%@
81%c.
Corn was comparatively firm and yielded re
luctantly â¢ to the bearish Influences in wheat.
Trade was Quiet. May closed a shade lower
at 65%@65-74c with the tone steady.
Oats were very dull. . The close- was steady,
with May unchanged at 45?4@45%c
Provisions ruled somewhat easier, influenced
by the weakness In grain?. May pork closed
10c down; lard 7%@10c lower, and ribs 2%e

his hopes for the future. "He declared
that shortly it would bÂ« possible to send

".Messages can only be read when the
receiver and the transmitter are attuned.
This attuned pystem as perfected is not

deemed necessary that each ship should
be equipped with apparatus which will
permit the reading of a. message sent from
any other fihip. because of the possibility
of aid bolr.gr required in case of danger.
Therefore all ships are attuned so that
one ship can call up any other ship."

The tea was very informal, only .a few
friends being invited, but the few were,
delightfully, entertained by these charm

Miss Catherine Herrin was hostess at
an informal tea on Sunday afternoon and
guests pronounced it one of the most de
lightful affairs of the. season. The draw

elaborately decorated with flowers, holly

Sunday matinee teas have not only be

comed by a coterie of sparkling debu

stilted formality of a reception. The men
are strikingly in evidence at these Sun

most of them can spare to do society.

Resolved! That a cony of the foregoing ba
forwarded to Admiral Schley, also to our
Senators and Representatives in Congress. -
Resolved. That ' we believe it the duty of
Congress, to review the record of the court, to
examine into all the circumstances and events
tending to throw light upon the controversy
and to announce its judgment as to who was in
command at the battle of Santiago, and as to
the conduct of Admiral Schley on that occa
sion.
Whereas, Though the verdict of that court
of inquiry left no stain upon his reputation as
a gallant and brave officer, yet two members
of that tribunal denounced his conduct of that
battle, in spite of the fact that a glorious vic
tory was won. and denied that he was chief
in command: and . *
Whereas. Our great admiral," George Dewey,
who by virtue of his ability and patriotism,
and who. as the hero of the greatest naval
victory of modern times,, was pre-eminently
qualified to judge of the . actions and orders
of Admiral Schley on that memorable day.
declared In a supplemental report that the
latter "had maintained an effective blockade,
and. as officer in absolute command, was en
titled to the credit for the victory off San
tiago." - ". - . Â¦ .
Whereas, Such efforts were so persistent that
Admiral Schley was forced, out of self-respect,
to demand a court of inquiry by the Govern
ment; and
Whereas, Efforts were made not pnly to de
tract from the glory due .to Rear Admiral
Sch'ley for his signal victory over the Spanish
fleet off Santiago, but to denounce his vic
torious plans of battle on that occasion and
to charge that gallant and generous officer
with cowardice in the face of the enemy; and â¢

TRAINS COLLIDE
ON A SIDETRACK
The Chancellor concluded by assurln*
the Germans of East Prussia that the
Government would not deviate . in tho
slightest from the track laid out by "that
greatest German," the late Prince Bis
marck.
I know only one policy. Just as I know only
one single. Individual nation. The questions at .
issue in the Eastern provinces are not religious'
but national. Thanks to our protection there
has arisen a community oC Polish citizens
which has now taken up the leadership of Po
lish agitation in a fanatical spirit, and which
is closely connected with, the Polish coloniza
tion commission. Now that these national con
flicts are forced on us only two possible courses
are open-^-either to allow ourselves to be Â¦ van
quished without a struggle or to protect our
skins. We cannot allow the roots of Prussian
strength to rot. The Polish question is th<Â»
most important before the nation and on its
settlement depends the development of the im
mediate future of. our fatherland. Our policy
is unchangeable. If need be, we shall provielo
further means to Improve the condition of the
German peasantry, promote industry and estab
lish garrisons. We hope to be able to cope
with. the situation with existing legislation.
We entertain no doubt of the loyalty of the
members of this House, but 1 beg the House
to have no doubt about the disloyalty of ths
Polish agitation. . -
The Chancellor disclaimed all desire to
slight .the Catholics, saying the Govern
ment's policy was neither Protestant nor
Catholic, just as his policy was neither
Liberal or Conservative. Continuing, Von
Bulow said:
Von Bulow prefaced his remarks by
saying that the incidents at Wreschen
had been greatly exaggerated and had
been utilized to plunge Germany into in
ternecine difficulties. What had occurred
was the fault of the Polish agitation and
not of the Prussian school system, which
was the same as had been enforced in
the bilingual districts for the past thirty
years and which was as little addicted
to cruelty as was the Prussian adminis
tration of justice. Corporal punishment.
th> speaker said, would hereafter be omit
ted during religious instructions. No one
prevented the Poles from speaking Pol
ish, but they must also learn to speak
German and participate in the German
work of civilization.
BERLIN, Jan. 13.â The Imperial Chan
cellor, Count von Bulow, replied in tha
lower House of the Diet to-day to the in
terpellations relative to the Polish ques
tion in, Prussia. The National Liberals
desired to know how Germanism was to
be upheld, while the Polish members bit
terly criticized the recent events at
Wreschen, declaring that the sentences
of the courts must have caused justice to
veil her face in shame.
M. Lampre said that of the 70,000 shares
of stock of the Panama Railroad Com
pany the new- Panama Canal Company
owns 69.534, and that the railroad com
pany had last year paid dividends to the
canal company amounting , to ,400,000
francs. He said, however, he knew noth
ing about the details of the management
of the railroad company.-â * '-"-"' Â¦'â¢Â¦- : ! -
"Yes, it was a sale, but one of the con
ditions of the transaction was that we
should give 60 per cent of the proceeds to
the old company," replied M. Lampre.
"Then the transaction between the two
companies; must have been a sale to the
new company without reference to the
bonds and the stockholders by the old
company?"
"Could the new company sell the prop
erty and put the proceeds in its pockets
and not share them with the old com
pany?" asked Morgan. . . ...
"Yes," replied the witness. ,"It could do
so under the authority of the stockhold
ers' meeting." .
In reply to thi3 inquiry M. Lampre said:
"He did not appear in the agreement, but
he gave the liquidator of the old com
pany authority to ei^ter Into the agree
ment." - . ,. . .Â¦"..
"Did you make a similar arrangement
with the liquidator qf the bondholders?"
asked Senator Morgan.
Senator Morgan questioned M. Lampre
especially concerning the interest of the
stockholders of the old Panama Canal
Company in the pending transaction. M.
Lampre stated that under the agreement
of the new company with the old com
pany the stockholders of , the latter con
cern would receive 60 per cent of the pro-,
ceeds'of the sale. He saia that under the
original subscription agreement of the
old company the stockholders had been en
titled to interest amounting to 5 per cent
per annum on their subscription even
while the canal was under course of con
struction, but that the interest had been
suspended when the old company went
into liquidation. He also said that the
agreement had been reached with the
liquidator as the representative of-'the
old company that in case of the sale of
the property he should appoint two arbi
trators while the new company appointed
two, these four to select â¢ the fifth, and
that all five should unite'in making an
equitable distribution of the proceeds of
the sale. He contended that, under the
French law the new- company had a per
fect right to make the transfer, notwitlv;
standing the old company's interest.
"I wish," he said? "to make this per
fectly clear t and want the committee to
understand that the company was entitled
to make a clear and perfect transfer to
the United States. It would be legiti
mate to make the transfer without the
interference of the old company, but to
make the way perfectly clear and to pre
vent any possible entanglement. we made
an agreement with the -liquidator of the
old company to the effect that he would
have absolute authority to deal directly
with the Government of the United
States."
WASHINGTON, Jan; . 13.â The Senate
Committee on Interoceanic Canals held a
session to-day. M. Lampre of the Panama
Canal Company was again before it. Sen
ator Morgan questioned him very closely
and at length, going over the ' examina
tion of Saturday, < but not bringing out
any new facts of especial importance.'
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.â In the Senate
to-day Nelson of Minnesota called up the

merce.-He explained the necessity which,
he said, existed for the passage of such a
measure, and was plied with questions by
several Senators, vwho said that sufficient
time had not been allowed for looking
into the merits of the measure. Teller
criticized that I feature relating to the
transfer of the Geological Survey, whilo
Hale said that the bill provided for a de

WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.â The House. of
Representatives spent the day in general
discussion of the 'pension '.' appropriation
bill, the 'first of the annual budgets. The
debate took a wide range. . Grosvenor of
Ohio and Hepburn of Iowa denounced a"
report presented to the last G. A. R. en
campment criticizing the course of them
selves and other members of Congress on
the veteran "preference" bill, which was
defeated at the last session. They ex
plained that their opposition to the bill
was due to the incorporation in the bill of
a. clause which had not been indorsed by
the G. A.- R.., placing veterans of the
Spanish war in the preferential class.
" Rixey . of Virginia caused something of
a stir on the Democratic side by advanc
ing a proposition to open the doors of na
tional soldiers' homes to ex-Confederates
and to furnish Federal aid to State Con
federate homes.- ; .
Richardson of Alabama was the only
Democrat who joined Rixey in support of
the proposal: .
One of the principal stockholders wanted me
to Eland in with him to freeze out a lot of
the other stockholders. I simply refused to do
anything of the kind and since that time they
have been doing' all they can to injure me and
do me harm. One of the directors wanted me
to put a lot of. false charges on the expense
account against the company. I refused point
blank and trouble began.
Doolittle unhesitatingly declared that he
had done nothing contrary to the instruc
tions of the Commissioners, who were
there and were satisfied with the dam.
Neither was hydraulicking enfmmenced, he
said, before receiving a permit, nor had
a hole been cut in thi dam.
Doolltttle further described how the
dam builders worked in all the bedrock
they' could and .filled.- in cribs, making
solid tiers as they were, built up, but
water came through the top.
Again the attorney questioned Doolittle
as to secret work, and once more Doolit
t!e replied that whatever appeared to be
secret was owing to "spies" from the
anti-debris people watching every daj,
and the frequency with which good dams
had been enjoined. He positively denied
any knowledge of a permanent opening
that could be safely used and closed on
the appearance of spies.- and again main
tained that there was no work done of a
secret description.
Doolittle then made the following state
ment:
Commissioners Satisfied.
In answer to Pomeroy the witness said
that he told the dam builders to do every
thing in accordance with the instructions
of the Commissioners, and as to any talk
of secrecy, he said that all that was wor
rying the defendant corporation was its
fear of being enjoined through spies of
the anti-debris people, who had enjoined
forty or fifty parties over the country
that had absolutely good dams. Spies, he
said, were in and around examining
dams almost daily.
The witness said he found that the orig
inal owners had cut a hole about thirty
feet from the bottom of the dam to get
out this water and "slum." so that they
would be enabled to raise the dam. Doo
little warned them that they were not do
ing right, he said. He also denied that
there was a secret hole made later for the
purpose of allowing debris to flow from
the dam. There was, he said, no surrep
titious hole. All logs were adjusted with
tremendous bolts, and a log could not be
swung around to allow debris to rush out.
Lagging was put in in such a way that
it could not be'pulled off. He denied that
lagging was removed constantly while
hydraulicking was in progress. The Com
missioners had given a permit to remove
lagging in order to. raise the dam. Debris
held in suspension naturally went out
with the water.
Found Hole in Door.
In answer to Attorney Pomeroy, Doolit
tle was emphatic In his statement; that
the cribs of the dam were filled from six
to ten feet with solid rock to make it
stronger. After it had been raised about
thirty-five feet it was found that the dam
was fo tight that it held the water, and
the tailings could not escape. The water,
said Doolittle, was running over the dam
at that time. '
The case of J. E. Doolittle against the
Gold Run Gravel Company, Limited, came
up before United States Court Commis
sioner Heacock yesterday. Jesse W.
Lilienthal appeared as counsel for Doolit
tle and Attorney Pomeroy for the defend
ant corporation. ' The main question be
fore the Commissioner is as to the open
ings in an impounding dam constructed
by. the defendant corporation on Its prop
erty, which it is alleged were left for pur
poses of permitting debris to escape sur
reptitiously. â¢"â¢â¢ .
Doolittle is suing the defendants for the
recovery' of $10,000 for two years' salary.
The defendant sets up as a defense to
Doolittle's claim the allegation that by
his direction the openings in the dam
were made, to its damage. â¢ ;*â¢
Secretary Hay has received an official
copy of the protocol signed by Minister
Merry and the Nicaraguan Minister for
Foreign Affairs. The State Department
will not make the document public, hold-
Ing that it is a feature of the negotiation
of a permanent treaty. Important points
of the protocol are a lease for 200 years
of a strip of territory ten miles wide,
through which the canal will run; a
guarantee of the sovereignty of Nicara
gua over . the rest of its territory, and
conferring upon the United States au
thority both to police the canal and exer
cise judicial rights in the territory ceded.
"The meeting had no relation whatever
to the construction by the United States
of the Nicaragua canal," said Dr. Corea
to-day. "The Nlcaraguan Minister for
Foreign Affairs has already signed tho
protocol which binds Nicaragua to make
the necessary canal concessions to the
United States. In asking the Presidents
of several states to meet him at Corinto
President Zelaya was actuated by a de
sire to have measures- adopted which will
insure permanent peace not only among
but in the several states which will be
represented. Each of the Central Amer
ican Presidents enjoys popularity at home
and is in no danger of having to meet a
revolution. There are no controversies
existing between the states. The mo
ment is therefore auspicious for the con
ference. I do not think the meeting has
any relation to an immediate union of
the Central American republics. I hope,
however, that it will mean closer rela
tions until the union becomes a fact."
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON. Jan. 13.â Probably
a step toward reorganization of the
greater republic of Central America is
the purpose of- the meeting of Presidents
of the five Central American States at
Corlnto, Nicaragua.' Whether a union be
formed or not, confidence is expressed in
Pan-American circles that the meeting of
Presidents will insure the prevalence of
peace in the Isthmian republics. It is un
derstood that Senor Corea, Nlcaraguan
Minister in Washington, had much to do
with the action of President Zelaya in
inviting the chiefs of other Central Amer
ican states to a conference.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
The meeting was held in the committee
room of Representative Wachter of
Maryland and was attended by Senator
McComas and all the Representatives
from' Maryland except Jackson, who was
out of the city. The various resolutions
and bills now before Congress were gone
over and it was the general sentiment of
those present that the delegations would
be fayorable to any one of the measures
which fully vindicated Admiral Schley.
But for the present, in view of the ad
miral placing the matter before President
Roosevelt, the delegation deemed It in
expedient to urge the matter before Con
gress.
SAVANNAH, Ga., Jan. 13.â Rear Ad
miral Schley was formally entertained in
the Cotton Exchange this . morning, for
more than an hour. He was accompanied
by General Gordon, a member of the ex
change, who introduced him to the other
members present. There was no set pro>
gramme. The admiral was in excellent
health and spirits and joined in the In
formal conversation. Business was vir
tually suspended until he had bowed
good-by and departed amid a storm of
applause and handclapping.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13.â The Maryland
delegation in Congress, including Senators
and Representatives, to-day considered
the course* to be pursued in the Schley
case and reached a determination that,
pending the decision of President Roose
velt on the appeal to be made by Admiral
Schley to the chief executive, it would be
inadvisable for the delegation to urge
upon Congress any of the resolutions or
bills introduced.' â¢ -
Delegate Griffith, Republican, presented
a joint resolution authorizing the Gover
nor to have executed by a 'Maryland artist
a bronze bust of Rear Admiral Scbley, to
be placed in the State House. at Annap
olis. Â¦ â¢ ,
ANNAPOLIS, Md., Jan. 13.â In the
House of Delegates to-night Delegate
Browning, Republican, presented a me
morial to Congress asking that body to
adopt the. report of. Admiral Dewey in
the Schley court of inquiry as the ver 7
diet of Congress.
ACCUSE SCOUT
OF KILLING BOY
Her face about the mouth and nose was
bruised, evidently from blows. As soon
as *hc assault was reported to the police.
Captain of Police Petersen detailed a
squad of men to search for the strange
assailant of the child.
Mrs. McClcud, aunt of the child, is un
able to explain why any one should at
tack Flossie and is inclined to think it
was the action of some demented person.
As soon as the police were notified. De
tective George Kyte was detailed to in
vestigate the etrange case. He could find
:io clew to the strange assailant. The po
lice thought the assault was the act of
an insane man. Dr. R. T. Stratton was
called to the Receiving Hospital and
found that the child was suffering from
extreme hysteria and from severe bruises
in ihe back and stomach. She also
showed signs of blows in the face.
"I was walking along Seventh street
with a young lady when a man called my
attention to the still form of a little grirl
near the fence. I went and picked her
up. She was cold and rigid and uncon
scious. I carried her to a drug store
close by and rang up for the police ambu
lance to take her to the hospital."
E. L. Dimmlck of Eighth and Castro
streets and Mr. Keefer of 722 Fourth
street were the first to discover the help
less and senseless child. Dimmlck said:
uncle, Mr. and Mrs. W. ML McCloud of 705
.Market street. Her lather is dead and
her mother is la Honolulu. About 7:30
0 clock the child was sent by her aunt to
Klingeberg's store, a00 Seventh street, to
jret Borne groceries. According to the dis
connected story told by the little girl,
after she had recovered consciousness at
ihe Receiving Hospital, she purchased the
supplies and started homeward.
-When 1 was near Seventh and Chest
nut streets," the child related, "a man
with long gray whiskers and a mask over
his face jumped out of a doorway,
grabbed me and threw some pepper in
my eyes. The next thing" I remember was
that the man threw me into a wagon. He
hurt my back. Then I forgot everything.
1 don't think I would know the man if I
would see him again. He took the limes,
pickles and salmon I had bought for my
auntie."

lying against a fence on the north side of
Seventh street, near Chestnut. Her feet
were tied hard together with a long black
stocking that had been drawn from her
foot, her arms were crossed behind her

Chief Deputy Vogelsang 1 of the Fish
Commission has finally succeeded in out-.,
witting a number of chronic game law
violators of Sonoma County, who, .for
several years past, have fished for steel
head trout with set nets, regardless* of the
statutes. Hearing, that Mr. "Vogelsang
was >very active in prosecuting offenders,
the illegal fishermen sent down word that
if any - of the commission's . officials
showed themselves along the Russian
River there would be some shooting.
. Knowing that as in past years the law
breakers would conceal their nets the mo
ment a deputy appeared, Mr. Vogelsang
decided to try a new method of proced
ure. Accordingly, last Thursday -night
Deputies "M. I* Cross an* W. H. "Welch
went secretly to a point on ' the river
some . distance above Duncan's Mills and
under cover of darkness embarked :tn a
rowboat. Before daylight they^ had se
cured six nets, varying from $75 to $150 in
value, the largest seizure ever made on a
single raid in the history of the commis
sion. . â¢-: . â¢
The nets and accompanying parapher
nalia will be confiscated. .

It would be Interesting to know, how many
are absent from this sanctuary and from
other sanctuaries this morning because the
gayeties of the past Â¦ week have simply ex
hausted them and left - them - -without the
strength of body, mind or spirit for public
worship. From the excessive burden of labor
I see no escape. Ths prosperity that Is ours,
and that we cannot and would not surrender,
urges us on. It is not in exchanging the
stress of toll for the equally enervating stress
of pleasure-seek! ngt and because six days of
the week leave no opportunity - for it, crowd
ing it into the seventh day. Such is the most
familiar excuse for the Sunday given up to
society. Beyond question this strain after
feverish pleasure is a peril to our bodies, but
if this were all it might be endured. There
are worse things, however, than dying young,
and. one of, them is dying spiritually. Becom-
Ing ,absorbed in sensuous delights on the Sab
bath is using the .Lord's day against our
selves. This we do when we use it for pleas
ure, carrying on into it the social gayeties that
have filled the six preceding: days and will
fill the etx days following. .
. In touching: on the excess of. the social
gayeties, now at ' their height, in "Wash
ington and their effect on religious life.
Dr. Hamlin said: ;
Many guests of our nation In the legation
at this capital are showing us scant courtesy
in lightly overriding our best national tradi
tions and customs of the Â¦ Lord's day. - Some
of our own people are nerveless enough to flat
ter by .Imitation. I appeal to you who know
Its blessings, to say a courteous but firm
"no" to every invitation to secularize It, be
cause you need it, and will . have it, for phy
sical rest and â¢ spiritual nurture.'
" Secretary Hay and his family are among
the worshipers. Dr. Hamlin said that he
regarded - an open tearoom, dining-room
and reception-room on Sunday a. deadier
evil than .an o'pen saloon. He then pro
ceeded to score the members of the for
eign legations for trying to bring: a Conti
nental i Sunday, with all of its iniquities,
to America.' ' He said :

In the* afternoon the examination of
witnesses was continued. Charles Larsen
was the first one called. He stated that
he was . in â¢ bed , before the collision, and
being unable to sleep had arisen to smoke
a pipe. When he felt the shock he rushed
up on deck, and on discovering what had
happened ran back to his bunk and hur
riedly dressed himself. He said that when
he came on deck he saw red and . green 1
lights on the Max. The witness said he
helped to place passengers in his boat and
that he was the last one'in it. He^fur
ther stated that there were thirteen peo
ple in the boat and that one of the pas
sengers was in charge.. They were picked
up by the. Dispatch at 10:30 that day. - Â»',

is lying at Green-street wharf. They- were
shown over the vessel by Captain Beholst.'
The officials made a thorough- inspection.
They noted how the Max was injured. and

Captain Benoist produced his charts and
explained- the course of -the -vessel.- -He
showed the inspectors pieces of- glass that
were a part of the Walla Walla's . red
light, which' had fallen on the deck of the
vessel after the collision. They also ex
amined the plates and pieces of "heavy
woodwork that once were a part^of-the

sion that the heavy collision bulkhead of
the Max alone saved' the French bark
from going to the bottom.
hours before the collision some
of the sailors or. firemen who slept' over
the steerage were drunk and quarrelsome.
Another, important bit. of testimony was

The affair was the one topic of con
versation in police circles yesterday and
last evening. Throughout the remainder
of the day Captain Seymour detailed
many of his subordinates to capture a.B
many members of the mob as possible as
well as the prisoner they rescued.- The
latter was attired in a light overcoat and
is supposed to live on Telegraph Hill.
Late last night the detectives stated they
had a clew as to- his identity.
But the struggle was short lived. The
officer was held fast by many arms and
was soon forced to fight to protect his
own life. As he fought, his prisoner was
torn from his grasp and hustled away
through one of the smaller alleys in which
the territory abounds. As. soon as Its
work of rescue had been done, the mob re
leased the officer, half stupefied from the
heavy blows, and scrambled for liberty.
In a moment Bailey was standing In a de
serted hallway.
Bailey, recovering again, seized the
thief with one hand while he fought off
his assailants with the other. He made a
daring stand against heavy odds.
A large crowd had been attracted by
the chase and a motley mob forced Its
way through the door and closed around
the policeman and his charge. Men of all
conditions in the degrading walks of life
Infest the alley and make it their ren
dezvous. The manacled man soon found
many sympathizers among â¢ the crooks,
thugs and degenerates who jostled in to
witness his recapture.
When Bailey started toward the door,
leading his prisoner by the arm, he found
his way impeded and ugly mutterings
came from the crowd. He ordered the
passageway cleared, but his mandate was
met with cries and Jeers. Then Teuddenlv
the attack was made. A large cobble
etone hurled from behind struck the offi
cer on the head and for a moment stunned
him. Men seized the prisoner and rushed
him forward.
Bailey then proceeded to make his pris
oner more secure to frustrate an attempt
at a second break. He took his handcuffs
from his pockets atid placed them on the
prisoner's wrists.
The thief turned up Kearny street, and
when he again reached Broadway headed
for Pinckney alley, where he ran into one
of the houses. The officer was close at his
heels, and he had hardly gained the end
of a hallway when he was clutched by
the peace guardian and thrown to' the

headquarters. As the pair were leaving
the scene a wagon drove by, and on ac
count of its uncertain course Bailey be
came slightly separated from his prisoner.

Bailey followed closely and dashed down
Montgomery avenue in the direction taken
by the fugitive. The chase was exciting.

The vacancy in the office' of adjutant
general of California will probably be
filled by the appointment of a, civil war
veteran with a National Guard record,
although Governor: Gage has- been im
portuned by Major General Dickinson and
others to appoint some one who has been
actively identified with the National
Guard organization. Among the . candi
dates for the office made vacant by the
death of General Seamans are Major Jan
sen of this city and Colonel Ensign of
San Diego. It was supposed that Colonel
Bangham, assistant -adjutant general,
would be promoted at once to the first
place, but he is said to have informed
his friends that he did not desire the
promotion, as the Increase of the salary
for -the year would hardly be more than
sufficient to purchase new uniforms for
the higher rank. It Is surmised that
Colonel Bangham was persuaded to yield
his rights to favor some : other aspirant
for the generalship. ...... ;
Governor Gage is apparently anxious* to
settle the question before a great con
tention is created. % He has practically. of
fered the place to Colonel George Stone,
chairman of the Republican State Cen
tral ' Committee, who was an open appli
cant for the office when the Governor was
inaugurated: It is said that the Gover
nor has earnestly requested Colonel Stone
to : accept the place and that the latter
has : decided in favor of acceptance. v

It is known that Phelan made an earn
est appeal in Fay's behalf to Supervisor
Horace Wilson. The last named received
his introduction to political life in the
Board of Supervisors through Phelan.
When he declined to vote for Fay the sin
of ingratitude was charged to his account
by the Phfelanites. The story goc3 that
the argument used by Phelan to convince
Crimmins that Fay should have the chief
clerkship was that Fay had a pull on all
the commissionsâ that the Commissioners
would recognize him as the friend and the
agent of the Mayor who appointed them.
It is just possible that Phelan sought to
pass out a gold brick to Crimmins, but
the facts are that the little boss- is using
all the power that he possesses to hold
Fay in the office of the clerk of the board.
When Crimmins wants a man placed
somewhere he will send for Fay, and he
will expect Fay to go to the Fire Commis
sion, Police Commission, Election Com
mission, Board of Works or Board of
Health and ask for something on Phe
lan's old account. A Commissioner refus
ing may be called an ingrate, but Phelan
cannot remove him from office, as he re
moved Blggy. -j j .-â¢.'.
Major Boxton does not owe anything to
Phelan, but he considers that Crimmins
stood by him when others were threaten
ing to do him up in the convention. He
would like ; to Oblige Crimmins, but can
not see his way clear to vote for Fay.
Hespeler, who is also known as Hes
per, refused to discuss his arrest, except
to say that he would prove his innocence
at the proper time. He claims that his
home is in Canada, and that at one time
he was a member of the provincial police.
In saying that I regard him. better fitted
than Fay for the position of chief clerk.
I voted for Ryan. There was no Repub
lican to vote for."
Several I worthless ' checks which Hse
peler' evidently intended to pass were
found in his grip. They were all drawn
on the Santa Monica Bank and were for
amounts ranging from $25 to $100.
Last evening Ryan and O'Dea ascer
tained that Hespeler was living in a pri
vate house on Twelfth street and they
set a watch on the place. Shortly before
7 o'clock a messenger boy went to the
house, and presenting a note from Hes
peler was given a grip containing some
of his property. The detectives followed
the boy to a saloon on Market street,
where Hespeler was waiting for him.
Recognizing him as the man who was
wanted for passing bogus paper, the de
tectives placed him under arrest and took
him to the City Prison, where he was
locked up in the "tanks." A search of
his clothing revealed a check book, the
property of the Santa Monica Bank, and
$00 in eold.
Fining himself short of money, he
passed a fraudulent check, it is claimed,
and came to this city. Shortly after his
arrival here Hespeler went to the Frank
lin Hotel and succeeded in inducing Van
Loon, the proprietor, to cash a check
drawn on the Bank of Santa Monica for
J1U0. ; Van Loon presented the check for
payment to one of the local banks and
the following day he was surprised io
learn that the paper had been repudiated
by the president of the Santa Monica in
stitution. He at once notified - Captain
Seymour, who detailed Detectives ityan
and O'Dea to run down Hespeler. While
the detectives were searching the city
for him a telegram was received by Cap
tain Seymour from the president of the
Santa Monica Bank, asking him to arrest
Hespeler for passing worthless checks on
the southern watering place.
A well dressed middle-aged man, giv
ing his name as A. E. Hespeler, was ar
rested las^t night by Detectives Ryan and
O'Dea for having passed a bogus check
for $100 on S. Van Loon, proprietor of .the
Hotel Franklin. Some time ago Hespeler
arrived in Santa Monica and cut a wide
swath.- : ' Â¦
Another fact that increases the mystery
is that the same person found both head
less bodies. He says that he found a
third corpse ten days* ago. but that be
fore he could notify the authorities it had
disappeared.
As no residents of the island are miss
ing, the mystery increases and the au
thorities are of the opinion that murders
have been committed at some point up the
sound; that the heads have been severed
to prevent identification and the bodies
cast into the water, and that the fides
have landed them on Whidby Island.
PORT TOWNSEND, Jan. 13.â The peo
ple of Whldby Island are excited over the
finding of another headless body on the
beach near Fort Casey. Last week a
body was found with the head and hands
cut off and the clothing removed and yes
terday another body was found there with
