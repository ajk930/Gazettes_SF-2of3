Louis Herman Drube and Len Han

Among Those Not Ac

Louis Herman Drube, who resided at
14 Lily avenue with his wife and three
children, was not in the boat that reached
Trinidad.
connected with the Olympic Club for a
number of years In the capacity of col
lector and bookkeeper. He is an unmar
ried man and resided with his 'brother's
family at 18C9 O'Farrell street. â¢ - Â£fyi
P. Nilsen, who lived at 263 Collingwood
street -with his wife and two little
daughters, is believed to be among the
lost. His wife has heard nothing from
him. â¢
George L. Field, whose name is on the
Walla Walla's passenger list, is a com
mercial traveler for C. N. Young, a
wholesale dealer in linens. Field is mar
ried and his wife is prostrated at their
home, 2250 Buena Vista avenue, Alameda.
Field sailed on the Walla Walla on
Wednesday bound for Seattle\on.one,Of
his regular business trips. Â¦
Not a word had reached Mrs. Field at
a late hour last night concerning her hus
band. The suspense was very trying. .The
wife kept up her courage as long as she
could. "I feel sure," she said, "that my
husband is not dj-owned. He must -have
been among the saved, for he Â«vas strong
and active and could get around in such
an accident quickly." â¢
Mrs. Minna Reynolds, stewardess of the
Walla Walla*, until a year ago : made her
home in Alameda with the family of A.
N. Vogel. 2163 Clinton avenue.- She was a
widow and 38 years of age. She leaves
three children, two girls, aged 11 and 12
years, -respectively, and a son, 10: years
old. They are now in a private school
in Victoria,. B. C. .Â¦ ,-.. X v
' Drube, for the past two years, ' con
ducted a barber shop at 708 McAlliater
street and a month ago sold out to Jacob
Holcenbcrg, - having determined to try his
fortune in Seattle. â¢
Mrs. Drube was taking lunch with her
son Herman yesterday afternoon when
Elmer, the .second son, rushed in weep
ing and broke the news of the disaster
to the family. The unhappy woman's
grief was so Intense that the sons were
i-larmed and sought the assistance of
kindly neighbors to come and give her
whatever comfort was possible under
such circumstances. â¢ â¢ . .
The passenger llst'of the Walla Walla
bears the names of A. Kotzschnur and
wife, who were bound for Tacoma. Thfs
Is believed to be an error, the name prob
ably being Herman Kotzschmar Jr., sec
ond assistant engineer of the internal rev
enue cutter Manning, now : stationed at
Tacoma. â¢ â¢Â¦â¢*'.
Inquiry at the office of the United Slates
revenue cutter service last night devel
oped that 4 Kotzschmar was appointed to
the service in 1895 and that he was grant
ed a leaxe of absence several weeks ago.
He came to this city with his wife and
for some time has been staying at Sausa
4ito. His leave was about to expire and
he determined to return. to his post on the
Walla Walla. The couple are counted
among the missing.

T. W. Stream of Tacoma and His
Wife Are Saved From Wreck.
â¢In the Hat of those who were rescued
from the "Walla Walla appear the names
of Mr. and Mrs. T. W. Stream, a promi
nent young Tacoma business man and hi3
bride, who were, wedded in this city oa
the 31st of December. The bride was Mls3
Leonore Kelley, daughter of Mrs. J. J.
Kelley of 5S9 Haight street. The youn?
couple were on their way to the groom's
home in Tacoma. They were accompanied
by the groom's mother, Mrs. A. T.
Stream, wife of Captain A. T. Stream of
the Tacoma Ship Building Yards.
The Intelligence that the ship which
was carrying the young couple and Mrs.
A T. Stream was wrecked reached this
city early yesterday morning, but it was
late in the afternoon before Mrs. Kelley
received a telegram from her son-in-law -
announcing that they had all been saved.
Mrs Kelley was almost prostrated by her
anxiety for the safety of the young:
couple and Mrs. Stream. The telegram
also announced that they had lost their
entire baggage in the wreck and that
they would return to this city before
going to Tacoma.
Mrs. T. W. Stream is a very charming
and popular young lady. She was born
and educated In this city, where she has
a host of friends. She is but, 19 years of
age and her mother desired a postpoue-
BBI3XE AND GROOM BESCTJED.
HIGHT upon the heels of a ferry-boat
sinking,' a railroad wreck and a fa
tal street car collision comes the
news of the wreck of the steamship
Walla Walla. At the best the in
formation received in this city yes
terday afternoon from telegraphic
sources was meager and most unsatisfy
ing.
Ban Francisco itself was enveloped in a
thick, wet fog when the report first arr
rived.. Crowds gathered around the bulle
tin boards, eager for news that could not
be furnished.' Men whose friends sailed
last* Wednesday on the ill-fated ship be-
Eieged the office of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company or kept hallooing
through a telephone trumpet in order to
appease their anxiety. The tension of
those interested increased as the day ad
vanced, for all the facts and details of
the wreck received here told but a small
fraction of the entire story.
Edwin Goodall, president of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company, flrst learned
of the sintawig of the Walla Walla when
he reachea* his office, shortly after 9
o'clock yesterday morning. He was then
handed a telegram from the company's
agent at Eureka containing the simple
news that the Walla Walla had been sunk
in collision with an iron ship and that
Captain Hall with sixty' passengers and
members of the crew had arrived at Eu
reka.
Mr. Goodall was much concerned over
the wreck. "Our information." he said,
"is extremely meager, and It is Impossible
for us to tell how many lives were lost.
There were thirty-eight first-class and
twenty-eight secpnd-class passengers, and
seventy-eight in 'the crew, making a total
of 144 persons aboard." Of Captain Hall,
Goodall had words only of commendation.
"This Is his first sea misfortune," he said,
"and we had utmost confidence in him."
Hall Is well known as a mariner and
bears a splendid reputation In his voca
tion.* He was successively chief officer of
the Vmatllla, master of the Coos Bay and
of the Corona before being Invested with
the (captaincy of the Walla Walla. His
brother. Charles Hall, was the command
er of the Centennial on her voyage north
when she broke down and drifted for
days In bad weather, finally landing on
the Alaska coast miles out of her route.
I BOUT half past 3 o'clock yesterday
afternoon the Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company received the following
dispatch from Captain Hall:

Captain Sinks With THg Ship.
"We had about sixty-five first and sec

163 souls all told. We had no knowledge
of the approach of the vessel striking us,
the weather being so thick that she was
not seen until we were struck. It was
very dark at the time and the uncertain
light Interfered to a great extent with the
rescuing of the passengers". I remained on
board, assisting them in every way possi
ble.
"In a few moments all the life boats
and rafts were out with the exception of
two which were smashed. One of these
boats contained nine or ten passengers.
All were thrown Into the water, but man
aged to board the life raft, which had
been launched a few minutes previously.
The second boat was smashed by striking
a heavy object In the water, but all the
passengers were rescued by another life
"Those of the passengers who had not
been awakened by the crash were aroused
e.t once. The vessel began to fill Imme
diately and she sank in thirty-nve min
utes. There was little confusion on board.
The officers and crew kept the passengers
from becoming panic stricken. The crew
was immediately ordered to man the life
boats and raits and an effort was made
to save the baggage. This was given up,
however, the vessel filling at such an
alarming rate that no time was wasted on
anything but the safety of the passengers.
I gave orders to have the port boilers
blown out, it being necessary to give the
vessel a list to keep the gaping hole in
her side out of the water.
little Confusion Aboard.
"After the crash the bark, which I be
lieve was a Frenchman, judging from the
l&cguage of her sailors, rebounded and
scraped along the Walla \Val!a."s side. I
called to her to stand by, but she drifted
away and was lost to view. I could not
tell how badly ehe was injured, but I do
not believe she was severely damaged, as
she struck us bow on. Though her for

E'UREKA, Jan. 8.-Captaln A. L. Hall,
master of the wrecked Walla Walla,
gives a graphic account of the dis
aster.
"We left San Francisco on
Wednesday, bound for Victoria and
Puget Sound." said he to-day. "The
weather thickened as the night advanced
and on Thursday morning a heavy fog,
accompanied by a light rain, set in. At
4:10 o'clock I was suddenly awakened by
an awful crash on the port side, well for
ward. Second Officer Lupp was on watch
at the time. The housing, especially in
the vicinity of my cabin, was badly shat
tered, the main force of the collision strik
ing the Walla Walla Just forward of my
stateroom. My bunk was struck and
thrown across the room on my table.
The captain and the crew of the Dis
patch were very careful to give every
attention to the wants of the passengers
and their wardrobes were depleted in sup
plying cldthing for the unfortunates..- .
Captain Johnson was loud in his praises
of the women rescued by him. Two In
particular, he said, were entitled to much
credit for the calmness they displayed.
According to Captain Johnson, the women
were far more nervy than the men and
gave valuable assistance in caring for
the survivors as each succeeding raft "or
boat was picked up. In most instances
it was with great difliculty that the sur
vivors were got aboard owing to the
heavy sea running.
Women Display Heroism.
"Several boats and rafts were picked up
at different intervals, the last about 4
o'clock on Thursday afternoon. Some of
the survivors were badly played out, es
pecially those on the life rafts... 'There
was a nasty, choppy sea running, and
this/ washing- over continually, interfered
with the tomf ort of the passengers to
such an extent that many were utterly
exhausted when picked' up.
"Of the passengers rescued several were
Injured. One's leg had been jammed and
two others were cut about the head and
shoulders. \ Captain Hall was Injured by
a spar as the vessel went down. Several
of the women were more dead than alive
when taken aboard and with difficulty
were resuscitated." * '
"About 8 o'clock on Thursday morning,"
said Captain Johnson, "my attention was
called to a small boat which was manned
by three men and coming toward us.
Owing to the fog we did not discover her
presence until ehe was right alongside.
As the boat approached nearer the men
hailed. This was the first Intimation that
I had that a marine disaster had oc
curred. The spokesman of the party in
formed me that the Walla Walla had
been sunk by an unknown vessel off the
Mendocino coast. The party proved to be
three firemen from the wrecked vessel.
We took them aboard, and lay to the re
mainder of the day.
Captain Victor Johnson of the Bteamer
Dispatch, to whom a majority of the
shipwrecked passengers owe their lives,
was seen shortly after this vessel was
docked at the railroad wharf.* The â¢ Dis
patch was bound for Seattle and left San
Francisco several hours prior to the de
parture of the Walla Walla. The latter
bteamer, being the faster, passed her at
Point Reyes about 3 o'clock on Wednes
day afternoon, gradually pulling away
until 'she was lost from sight.
Captain Johnson's Account.
"From the information I have concern
ing the rescue of passengers and crew,
I am not able to say how Targe the death
list will be, but in my opinion it will not
be less than twenty. A -number were in
jured by the falling timbers. It is cer
tain some- of the steerage passengers per
ished in this manner, the housing to the
forward being split into matchwood.
"Among the survivors few'were serious
ly injured, and while it may be possible
many were shockingly mangled those for
tunate enough to escape were. singularly
lucky. But few cuts and bruises came
under my observation and these for the
most part were received by the occupants
of the life rafts. While not very rough,
the sea was nasty and choppy and tne
continual wash over the rafts < was a
hardship, especially to the ladies, many
of whom were nearly in the last stages
of exhaustion when picked up by the Dis
patch."
we were all more or lees played out when
captain Johnson took us aboard the Dis

get every one aboard Â¦ the life - rafts. In
this he was ably. seconded by his subordi

there was no more excitenlent aboard.

George Relss of San Francisco, who was
one of the crew on the -Walla Walla, gave
the following account of the disaster:
"It was 4 :10 - o'clock when the French
vessel hit the Walla Walla bow on. All of
the passengers were asleep when the
crash came, but they, soon rushed out of
their staterooms and. the deck was crowd
ed. Captain Hall went down in the steer
age and found a 4 family, of seven persons

Much interest is being shown by sports
men in the ninteenth annual meeting of
the Pacific Coast Field Trials Club, which
commences at Santa Maria one week
from Monday. The principal strings of
dogs have been on the ground some time,
being prepared for their important en

moored safely. During the winter- they
will be laid up either in Oakland Creek or

A matter- of 'much Interest to yachts
mtn all over the bay of San Francisco ts
bcing,dlscussed. It 13 well known there Is
no safe winter anchorage on the bay, Sau
ealito being exposed to the force of south
easterly storms and Tiburon Cove -to
southv/esterly, gales. The California
yachts are safe in Oakland Creek, ; but
Corinthian" and < San ' Francisco owners
must out their- craft into the lagoon be
hind Tiburon. This la a job of some diffi
culty* ami- even a Httle' danger, as the
boat.s have -to be towod in -through the
narrow opening Â¦ made by raising the
drawbridge. Every year minor accidents
befall the, yachts, and it is only by thej
exercise of great' care that, serious onea
are 'averted. . ' .
It is n. well-known fact that San Fran
cisco Bay has not received as large appro
priations f rum Congress as many other
sea ports' of the United States; 'and it Is
proposed- to make a strong effort to se
vuru an appropriation for me dredging of
Tiburon Cove to' make > It a safe harbor
of refuge at all times of the year for
tmall craft. ;
a Tiburon is becoming; & bay port of some
importanco for schooners carrying lumber
and other Â¦: cargoes. .'The inhabitants of
Belvedere and Tiburon and the California
Northwestern Hallway - officials > are
strongly in favor of the, project. -.A peti
tion has already been prepared, which will
be placed In the hands of the California
Congressmen, for presentation to the
HoU&e of Representatives.- This is a mat
ter in -which -all owners : of small craft
trading - schooners, \ â¢ launches, arks and
yachts are interested and is expected to
meet with general support. ~
To make a safe harbor it will be neces
sary to dredge the mud out to a uniform
depth and, erect i a "mole stretching out
from Belvedere. Point to keep the mud of
the upper ,bay. from "accumulating and
filling the cove again. Â¦:Â¦Â¦--..

Fourteen fast coursers are entered in
the Inaugural stake, which is on the card
as a special event for to-morrow's attrac
tion at Union Coursing Park.
The stake Is for greyhounds of class and
has' on its list of entries coursers that are
recognized as champions. ' .
Albert R. Curtis' kennel, it is figured,
has an excellent chance of running one,
two, in the event. The fast' young repre
sentative Rector, to ail appearances, is.
the strongest ' candidate for final honors
and should run the deciding course with
his kennel mate Chart a.
While the stake looks, to the admirers
of vhe Curtis dogs a presentation to that
kennel, the other -candidates for honors'
axe not without good backing. The.-win
ner of the, last Futurity, Cold Shivers, is
a dangerous opponent in any company,
and Freeze Out, his clever sister, has
Ehown her worth against the crack per
formers in many stakes. Wedgewood, is
running In first-class form' and it will not
cause great surprise if he shows the way,
in the contest for the final flag to the Cur
tis kennel aspirants for honors.
With his fast hound Tiburon D. J.
Healey figures to get within the big
money, at least. , and expects to have his
courser a contestant in the day's . last
trial.
Honors in last year's Inaugural were j
won by Eugene Geary's champion, Palo
Alto, and that speedy traveler kept up his
,rapid pace throughout the year and
earned the season's laurels.
During the stake Palo Alto met and de
feated in turn Narcissus, Flying Fox and
Beacon, the Curtis kennel. cracks, and
wound up his clever work , by beating D.
J. Healey's Lady Clare in the hnal.
Coursing enthusiasts will miss Palo -Alto
in . this year's event. While in- training
for the stake the chamnion fell over an
embankment near the Cliff House and re
ceived injuries that will necessitate his'
withdrawal from the game for some time.
Mike Walsh- of - Benicia ha3 been sus
pended by the Pacific Coursing Club of
Stockton hecause of alleged ill treatment
of his dogs. The club has notified the Cal
ifornia Coursing Committee of the suspen
sion and asks that that body ratify, it3
action. Thunderbolt, a. greyhound run by
Walsh In last Sunday's stake, died on
Monday under, what the club declares
suspicious' circumstances. ; ' \Valsh* denies
that he , was in any way responsible for
the. dog's death, which he says ,was due to
natural causes. 1 â¢
Sacramento Boy has .been withdrawn
temporarily from active coursing and will
be bred to .M. C- Delano's Brilliantlne
Delano owned Sacramento 'Boy. but nre
sented.him when' a puppy to Walsh and
Hee.ian of the' capital: city.' He has al
ways been an admirer of the fast dog as a
courser and will experiment with him as
a breeder. . Â¦ , Â¦ â¢ Â¦ Â¦ - -...-- - . .

HUNTING DATES
ARE ANNOUNCED

dogs. They were matched to meet at the
Manitoba trials as an outcome -of the dis
cuesion. This match fell through.
. They met again at the Northwest trials
at Seattle, when Clipper W was returned
Â¦winner. Since then i Henry Betten, the
trainer of Clipper W, has retired- from
business. The dog was returned to his
owner and Â¦was thrown out of training.
Dr. Wilson was anxious to enter him, but
without a professional handler could do
nothing in the premises.
Cuba Jr., the property of W. S. Tevis,
is the unknown quantity in the trials. He
has Just returned from the Eastern cir
cuit, and has won more prizes than any
Derby entry. While in the East he de
feated some famous dogs, , being pro
nounced the best broken pointer on the
circuit. His work has been done on prai
rie chickens and bobwhites. How be will
â¢work on the tricky California quail and
under different conditions of grounds and
weather remains to be determined. R. M.
Dodge, who handles the Tevis string, has
been successful on the circuit. With a
small number of dogs he has won nine
times this season.
The most convenient train for the trials
Is that one which leaves Third and Town
send streets each day at 8 a. m. This

EtjREKA, Jan. 3.â There 13 much spec
ulation-here as to what became of the
French bark that sank the Walla. Walla.
Nearly all of the survivors say that she
displayed no lights after 'the disaster and
soon disappeared, while a few claim, to
have" seen her for some minutes after the
collision, during which time she was mov
ing - rapidly away. There are some per
sons who are inclined to the belief that
the bark may have gone down after the
collision, but the great majority are of the
opinion that, finding his vessel practically
undamaged and realizing the terrible
catastrophe for which he was responsible
the captain of the strange craft crowded
on call and hurried away.

Incident of the disaster. â¢
"Just as one, of the boats was about
to push off," she said, "it was discovered
that there was ; room for ' another lady
and Mrs. 'Allen, wife ofi Dr. Allen of Ta-'

asked if there was room for her husband
and when told there was not she said s*he*
would remain with him. I believe born

George Chapman, one of the waiters on
the wrecked steamer, said to-night: '
â¢ VI * was asleep when ; the -'vessel ,cut us
down. At the first crash I sprang from
my bunk and rushed on deck, to find that
an immense sailing vessel had smashed
into us on the port side Just abaft the
fore rigging.' The. captain was giving or
ders-to have the ' boats provisioned and
swung out on the davits.* The entire crew
and passengers behaved splendidly - and
Manv Acts of Heroism.
Williamson stayed .with tHe ship until
she was about to go down. Then he
grasped a rope and swung over the side.
He tried to keep on top of the wreck, but
as the vessel began to sink he was caught
in the propeller and had a hard time to
free himself. He at last was picked up by
a raft, and, with a few others, v was res
cued by the Dispatch. The raft was under
two feet of water and the men were com
pelled to sit in this water and hold on -to
prevent' being washed off by the - heavy
seas. They maintained this position until
they were picked up.
S. Williamson, a bartender of the Walla
Walla, was the last to leave the wreck.
When the crash came he went forward
and saw a large bark was just '.passing.
The bark was so near that he could have
jumped on board her at that time. The
passengers were hastily getting into the
lifeboats and soon the deck was quite
well cleared. ' One - family, consisting of
five, supposed to be foreigners, remained
in the bow of the boat. Different mem
bers of the family were asked to get into
the boats, but. there not being * room for
the entire family they- clung together,
wishing to die together rather than be
separated. They were in the steerage of
the Walla Walla and happened to be in
the end shut off from the compartment
where the. bark pierced her. The timbers
of the boat were so crushed that persons
in the other end of the steerage were cut
off from the exit and were thus closed in
with no hope for escape or chance to free
themselves. Two of these were got out,
but others are supposed to have . gone
down with the ship. Â¦ .-. ; : .
Steerage Passengers Penned In.
"Chief Steward John Cornell refused to
leave the ship, saying there was plenty
of time; nor would Purser Nuttman take
a boat. The water was full of wreckage.
It was impossible for us to get away
from it for over an hour.
"It was pitiable to hear the people on
the. wreckage crying for help. We could
not get near them to help them." â¢
When asked whether the French bark
carried a lleht he said:
"I did not see any until about a half
hour after the collision, when one ap
peared."

"The captain remained at his post dur

an improvised raft, .where he lay for some
time upon the, flat of < his : stomach, . as
though suffering great pain. Hia compan

whom were First Assistant Â¦ Engineer
Reed, a waiter named Gibson, two oilers,
a fireman and four passengers.- We were
picked up â¢ by the Dispatch after having
been tossed about on the waves for almost
twelve hours. A heavy sea was running
andmade it almost .impossible for us to
stay with the raft. A stiff breeze was
blowing, driving the spray against our. al

to our. misery. When we were taken on

"This terrible .disaster will always live

piteous calls for help from the doomed as
the vessel sank beneath the waves."
many were the acts of heroism that oc

women among the passengers were gath

chance of -rescue, while many of the men
did what they could to aid the crew, in
launching lifeboats and liferafts.

CALL BUREAU; 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.â There Will
be no international opposition offered to
the descent of General Matos and 350 of
his, followers Venezuela. .Even if
foreign warships fall in ; with ; the steamer
Ban Eigh, conveying -the 'revolutionary
expedition j to a j port -. of . Venezuela, she
will. not be Interfered with. ; The moral
sympathy of European nations and of the
United States is with the revolutionary
movement," and in view of the fact that
the Ban Righ has been fitted out as a
warship ; at Fort de France, the charge
is - made by. sympathizers of President
Castro that France is actively â¢ encourag
ing the revolution against him. If Castro
succeeds in crushing the . revolt he may
go so far as to .submit a claim for dam
ages against the French . republic. ' Such
a claim will probably receive no consid
eration from the Paris 'Foreign Office,
though international lawyers say that a
government which knowingly permits the
fitting i out of an armed ship for the pur
pose of operating against a state with
which .it. is at peace has committed a
breach of the law of nations and is liable
for damages.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
â¢^On December 1 I made the first pay
ment of $250 to . Sullivan, who signed a
receipt with a fancy name, agreeing' to
furnish me with ten men for a further
payment of $300. Next day he raised the
price to $550. He admitted that this price
v/as illegal and explained that that was
the reason why he did not sign his own
name, adding that unless I paid $550 at
once "he would again raise his price. On
advice of other captains, English and Ger
man, I paid." - .
"I was threatened by Sullivan with hav
ing to go without men if I did not allow
my crew full liberty to desert. I con
sulted the French Consular Agent and
several captains. They all assured me
that Sullivan was such a power in Port
land that I would have to treat him with
consideration and buy sailors at his price.
I had finally to allow my cabin boy,
Eterville. to desert, after several at
tempts to prevent it. The first mate de
serted in open day. I had to return the
effects of the cook, who also deserted his
bread at daylight after stealing a quan
tity of goods.
The captain of the Lamoriciere writes on
December 10 that nine of his men were
so kidnaped. Even a little cabin boy,
Gaston Brossard, he says, was removed
from a hospital and has since disap
peared. He had to buy fresh hands and
pay a fine. The captain of the Bourbakl
writes on October 12 that his men were
supplied with liquor until they became
insubordinate and four deserted. Of
these he arrested three. ' Then, he de
clares, a gang kidnaped five other men
by night from the ship after stupefying
them with liquor. The captain of the
General Mellinet writes: .
As soon as a vessel arrives, . says Schi
vob, this gang entices the men to them
with drugged liquor until they have been
entered as deserters and then sells them
to other captains. This, after all, is
merely a classical form of the "crimping"
trade. It is aggravated against French
captains by - the .imposition of a tine of
jjl25 on each vessel fiyjng the tri-color.
bulllvan. the editor says,, has imposed
this penalty because one of the French
captains insisted on arresting a deserter.
The unfortunate Gauls : whose | crews
have been debauched -and induced to de
sert must therefore pay $125 to the ga.ng
before they can get fresh , hands, for
which they have to pay a further $o5 per
man. As the law of France forbids de
serters to return home, each of the men
led astray is practically lost to his coun
try, ceases to support his wife and fam
ily and diminishes . the strength of the
naval reserve.
PARIS. Jan. 3.â Maurice Schlvob, editor
of the Phare de la Loire, publishes an
other article on what he calls "White
Slave Trade In -American Ports,".' or, in
other words, the "crimping" of French
merchant crews at Portland , Or. Wi linn
a month, he declares, nearly 100 seamen
have been lost to France and eight ships'
crews have been hopelessly disorganized.
All this is said to be' the. work 1 of an or
ganized gang headed by a local political
"doss." a person named Sullivan.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Baron Boilleau had many wealthy
friends in London who would have will
ingly advanced him any sum of money
needed. Among these is the executor of
his mother's will, who lives in one of the
largest mansions in Park lane. Baron
Boilleau, however, kept his troubles to
himself, and when found dead in the. rail
road carriage he had only one penny in
his pocket. His estates in Iceland and in
terests in America, which are intact, are
valuable. V
The suicide was wealthy, but lately he
had spent large sums in endeavoring to
pet the Iceland Parliament to permit
English vessels to lish within the three
mile limit. With this end in view he was
getting up a wealthy English syndicate.
He recently sent to America for Â£1000,
but only received Â£2J0, and appeared
despondent at the delay of the Icelanders
in coming to an agreement.
Home Payne, a lawyer, testified that
the deceased, was a French Baron and
the son of a former French Consul Gen
eral in Canada. The Baron had been de
pressed on account of business matters.
He iived in Iceland, where he had a large
estate.
Baron Boilleau's father was formerly
firet secretary of the French legation at
"Washington. He was appointed by Em
peror Napoleon III, and held the addi
tional office of Canadian Consul General.
While in Washington he married Senator
Thomas H. Benton's daughter, thus be
coming a brother-in-law of General Fre
mont. The elder Boilleau later was
French Minister to Peru and married
again. His widow is now living at Pisa.
The suicide was the elder Baron Boil
leau's youngest son by his first marriage.
The deceased had two brothers in Amer
ica. The eldest. Baron Benton Boilleau,
resided at New Orleans.
LONDON, Jan. 3.â A verdict of suicide
during temporary insanity was returned
by a Coroner's jury this morning in the
case of Baron Charles Cauldre Boilleau,
â¢who was found shot in a railroad carriage
at Loughborough Junction on Sunday.

nurses for South Africa. Lord Kltchent-r

LONDON. Jan. 4.â Lord Roberts has is
sued an official contradiction of -the
stories circulated on the Continent of the
violation of Boer women by the troops in
South Africa and the employment of Boer
female refugees for immoral purposes.
, PRETORIA, Jan. 3.â General Dewet has
ordered the Boer commandants to reUnl
the work of extending the British block
houses at any cost. Further fighting {nay
consequently be expected. General Bruce
Hamilton has captured another Beer
laager and twenty-two prisoners on iha
Swaziland border.
General . Botha has sent a note to all
Boer commandoes requesting them - to
keep on fighting, for the British Parlia
ment is to be asked for another war vote,

BRUSSELS, Jan. 3.â The Count, da
Turenne, who holds the grade of Minister
Plenipotentiary in the French diplomatic
service, but who has no. post at present,
has sent a remarkable letter to the Inde
pendence Beige, suggesting a basis for the
settlement of the South African war. The
communication excites comment, not only
on account of the boldness of the diplo
mat in interfering in such questions, but
from the fact that the Count de Turenne
is related to prominent English famil'ea
and at the same time has been intimately
associated with Kruger and the Boer rep
resentatives on the Continent. The Count
asserts that, in view of the present situa
tion, he is confident Kruger will accept
autonomy for the countries south of
Bechuanaland, ' without any restriction

it seems conceded it will get away with the surplus.
A Chicago Judge has decided .that- a man who has
a job paying $25 a week can afford to get married,

of the job would entitle him to divorce. \ These Chi

It is to be noted y that while the smaller banks have
as a rule been established 1 for the purpose of getting
the benefits of circulating notes, the larger banks
have not, had that object in view. A report from
Washington- says: "The bonds deposited to secure
circulation by the smaller banks were $4,731,600 in
par value, or a little more than one-third of;the capi
tal of the banks. In the case of the larger banks the
bonds deposited were only $6,872,500 in par value, or
considerably less' than 25 per cent of capital."
The v increase in the number of national banks does
not represent an equal - increase in the -number of
banks in the country, as many of them have ' but
taken the places of other banking institutions. Be
tween the passage of the gold; act and;' the. close of
last November 108 State banks, with a total capital
of $8,240,000, were converted into national banks."
i One gratifying feature of the operation of the Jaw
The increase in the number of banks has not been
accompanied by anything like a proportionate in
crease in the amount of capital invested. That" is due,
to the fact that most of the new banks have been es
tablished under the clause- of the^ law which for. the
first time authorized the establishment of national
banks with a capital of less than $50,000. Within
the interval under consideration there have ' been
chartered 518 such banks, having an aggregate capi
tal of $13,559,500, forming about two-thirds of the
total number of new banks, but having less than one
third of their aggregate capital.
AN estimate of' the beneficial effectiveness of the
new "banking law may be derived from the
statement that from the enactment of the gold
standard law, on March 14, 1000, down to the close
of November last there has been a net increase of 692
national banks; located in well nigh every part of the
country. The increase is the more notable because
a good many of the older banks have closed up or
consolidated with others during the period. More
over, the full benefits of the law have not yet been
attained, for recent reports from Washington an
nounce that in the first half of December ten addi
tional national banks were chartered, and the Comp
troller's office has on file upward of 100 approved'ap
plications for charters. . â¢

The Army and Navy Journal, the organ of the
united service, expresses the opinion that Secretary
Root's humiliation of General Miles in a published
order was not only unjustified but was itself a viola
tion of the articles of war. Such an act toward the
general of the army is held by the Journal to be dis
tinctly a punishment that could be legally adminis
tered only after the officer receiving it had been con
victed by a court-martial, and there is evidence that
this view is approved by army officers. The older
men among them recall the trying experiences many
worthy soldiers had during the reign of Secretary
Stanton, who during the Civil War did not hesitate
to treat even President Lincoln with indignity, and
who sometimes seemed to inflict humiliation upon
officers for the mere pleasure of showing his temper
and his power. The country is not in ; the highly
passionate condition Â«vhich characterized that period
and will not accept a return to methods that were
then a parr*6f the whirlwind.
Obviously only one way was open, and that the
separate expression of his opinion. He would have
held a questionable place in history had he signed
the findings and, after his official function had ceased,
had stated his differing judgment. In such case he
would have laid himself liable to discipline for unoffi
cial criticism of a judgment in which he had appar
ently concurred officially. He did the only thing left
possible to a brave officer and honest gentleman in
his situation. His expression was therefore the offi
cial utterance of the president of the court, in dis
sent from his colleagues. Civilians are not yet able
to see just why General Miles' comment on that
public and official record was an injurious violation
of army discipline. Among civilians the question
runs, Would he have been harshly reproved and
humiliated if he had dissented from Dewey's view
and rebuked him for its expression?
The Schley hearing was a public and official mat
ter. Admiral Dewey presided over the court of in
quiry with commendable firmness and fairness. ' If
the balance tipped it was not his fault. As president
of the court he was compelled by the regulations io
certify the findings by his signature. With the find
ings, however, he did not agree. They represented
the judgment of the two other admirals who, with
Dewey, composed the court. As they did not record
his full judgment how was Admiral Dewey to make
his dissent known to the service and the country?
' I sharp reproof of General Miles by the Sec-
J retary of War for remarks approving the con
*â¢ elusions of Admiral Dewey in the Schley case
has proved interesting to civilians.
MILITARY DISCIPLINE.
Such being the case, it is certain that while the
effort now being made in Paris to induce. capitalists
to enter upon a comprehensive scheme for connect
ing- our railway system with that of Russia may fail,
a good deal of railway construction will be under
taken in the immediate future in Alaska. Thus there
will be formed a northern movement ' of American
lines which sooner or later will have comparatively
close connection with the Russian roads. The great
undertaking as a ' whole may. therefore be . accom
plished by piecemeal, as it were, in a period compara
tively short. There was a time! when it was sup
posed that a railroad across what was called "the
American . desert" would be unprofitable. In that
desert there are now established some of the most
prosperous of American communities. The Alaskan
wilds may prove in the end to be as profitable to
railway construction as was the so-called desert.
In his recent report upon Alaska the Secretary of
the Interior, after giving statistics of the output of
gold, says: "Silver and platinum have been found in
paying quantities, and there have been allegations of
the discovery of tin and cinnabar. Mountains' of
iron are available, but very little attention is paid to
iron on account of the search for gold. Copper
mines have been opened upon the shores of Prince
William Sound, Prince of Wales Island and Dall Isl
and. The Governor expresses the opinion that the
mining interests of Alaska have become so extensive
and valuable as to render advisable the appointment
of a Commissioner of Mines, whose duty would be
to exercise general supervision over the mining
operations of .the district, to protect mining compa
nies against unjust litigation for damages, and to re
quire the companies to conform to regulations ; pre
scribed for the protection of miners."
. That Alaskan railways, through the mining regions
at any rate, would prove even more profitable than
the Siberian line, can hardly be questioned. The re
cent explorations of the country have proven it to
be one of the richest mineral regions in the world.
Gold is by no means the only m ! that could be
profitably mined if once railways constructed to
provide cheap freights between the seaboard and the
interior. , '
There can.be no question that the frozen north is
much richer than was supposed by *even" the best in
formed people a few years ago. The Russians them
selves did not know the wealth of Siberia nor the
profits' that would accrue from the construction of
a railway across its vast plains. The road was under
taken mainly for military purposes. No great
amount of traffic was looked for, and accordingly it
was constructed 'as inexpensively as possible. .No
sooner, however, was the Siberian country opened up
than traffic increased, and American. Consuls in Rus
sia have reported that one of the reasons for the slow
advance of the line is that large stretches of it have
had to be torn up and relaid with heavier rails and
stronger roadbeds to accommodate the traffic that so
unexpectedly sprung up. â¢ â¢ . .
-The propose/! route has been discussed in a specu
lative way for a long time. 'In fact, ever since the
Russian Government entered earnestly upon the
gigantic task of constructing a railway across Siberia
the thought that the line might be eventually
brought into close connection with American lines
has been in the public mind. The unexpectedly
large traffic that has followed the building of the
Siberian line has had the effect .,, of . reviving the
greater project from time to .time arid giving it an
increased amount of attention from practical men.
Of late the extraordinary development of Alaska has
further strengthened the hopes of the advocates 'Â¦[ of
such a connecting line between the two continents,
so that the Paris reports may mean, the beginning at
least of a serious effort to accomplish the project.
A CCORDING to reports from Paris a number
' A\ of enterprising men in that city are endeav
/ *Â¦ oring to enlist capital to undertake the con
struction of a railway to connect the Siberian sys
tem with American roads so as to open a through
line from Paris to New York. It is said a' number
of Americans, and Russians are interested in the en
terprise, which is described as being feasible and cer
tain to be profitable. -Â»

mine the valuation of the investment and then
must determine a fair compensation or inter
est rate on It. Finally, they fix rates, dis
tributing the payment of the compensation
among the consumers. The investment Is thus
made a variable quantity for which there is
no fixed rule of estimation. Experience has
shown that ' the current rate of interest is
eeslly ascertalnable, and not disputed to any
cerious extent as being a fair measure of com
pensation. The Investment valuation, however,
is. as experience has demonstrated, an uncer
tain matter in the absence of a rule for esti
mating It. Really its ascertainment should be
a purely formal matter, incapable of being
made. the subject of a dispute. If eliminated
as a disputable matter and made a matter of
record the writer believes private capital could
be induced to consider a proposition to bring
water Into San Francisco from the- Sierra Ne
vada Mountains.
To effect its elimination the writer has pre
pared the following rule for estimating the
valuation of a, water works for the fixing of
water rates, which is suggested as an amend
ment, to the charter:
The first difficulty that would deter private
enterprise is the belief that the power of the
Board of Supervisors In fixing water rates
might be exercised to practically. confiscate the
Investment or at least impair its earning power.
The belief is based on the annual wrangle
with the Spring Valley "Water "Works and the
difficulty Oakland has with the Contra Costa
Water Company. While a new company with
water in its works and with no water in its In
vestment would not - come in conflict with
ANSWERS TO, QUERIES.
Official Estimates Not Justified.
The so-called estimates of cost of the City
Engineer and Board of , Public Works ranging
from $31,205,200 to $39,400,000 have no Justifi
cation in engineering business or morality.
They are simply a scandalous fraud on the tax
payers of San Francisco who have paid $50,000
for a pretense of what was expected for the
money.
The bringing in of water from the Sierra Ne
vada Mountains by private capital is possible,
but two difficulties are in the way .that make
it improbable that it would be undertaken.
There Is an existing condition as well that may
make it impossible. :
The water supply that this city needs now
can be brought to it from the moutnalns, ex
cluding the cost of a city distributing system,
from the five possible sources in the Sierra Ne
vada Mountains, for from $10,000,000 for the
nearest to not more than $17,000,000 for the
most remote. No private company would pro
vide works other than such that these sums
would pay the cost which includes contractors'
profits of construction. The city should not do
more or pay more than a private corporation.
Tho cost of bringing a water supply . from
the Sierra Nevada Mountains is readily deter
minable. The pipes and excavation are meas
ureable quantities. Both can be bought at
prices which are readily and accurately known.
It is not necessary to build the works for the
people who will live in San Francisco in its
distant future. | Those people can jj pay for
their own \ water . works. The, people here to
day, do all that the future can In reason expect
when they, provide for that future its source
of. supply and pay for It for tfie future. So
Tar as works for bringing the water to the
city are concerned it is neither business nor
necessity which would require more than what
would supply the people here now. "A private
enterprise for profit would certainly do no
more than this and the city should not. â¢ ""
There is no physical condition in the general
problem of bringing a water supply to San
Francisco .from the Sierra Nevada Mountains
that necessitates ; the fantastic plans proposed
by the j City Engineer. There is no real occa
sion for the . childish fears of unknown dan
gers with which. he seeks to justify his plans.
The public should not be deceived by tho City
Engineer's and the Board of Public "Works' in
firmities of effort. ' -â¢ ,
The engineering problem of bringing water
from any of these sources is nofdifflcult. Noth
ing in the way of construction is required to
be , done ' that is not already an accomplished
successful construction in \ other! water works.
The 'pipe lines are long, but longer ones are in
use elsewhere already. The pressures on the
pipes projected would be less than on water
supply pipes . already in use. The pipes would
be of - larger . diameter, but there are larger
diameters in use in the water supply of nearby
cities. Dams have to be built; but they ar<\
insignificant structures when compared with
dams built for the water supply" of other
cities. The conduits have to be tunnels for
greater or less distances, but other water sup
ply systems now have longer and 'more , diffi
cult tunnels in service. The. conduits would
cross rivers and it may be the San Francisco
Bay. Other cities bring their water supplies
under or through rivers, lakes and bays, under
severer conditions and for longer distances than
would be required here. . Â¦

(The Call does not hold itself responsible for the opinions published below, but presents them for whatever value they may have to its readers.)
Operating under this amendment the private
enterprise to get a value on its franchise
would have to sell water. Until It sold some
thing like 3O,0CO,00O gallons a. day it would
have no franchise valuation whatever. The
amendment doe3 not Impair the power of tha
Board of Supervisors to make at different
times 3. 4, 5. 6 or " per cent as the rate of
Interest they will allow as Income on the
Investment. On the other hand the private
enterprise has every Incentive to economy and
no incentive to waste or extravagant expendi
ture. The reason for excluding watershed
lands and works for purifying and protecting
the quantity or purity of the water is that
the risk of the quantity and quality is the
risk of the purveyor, j He is presumed to know
the limitation in Quantity of the water he la
doing business with and is presumed to pur
vey pure water.
The writer believes It would be much to
the advantage of the city to adopt the amend
ment suggested and that capital would then
consider and take up the bringing of water to
San Francisco. The second difficulty with thÂ«
first overcome would not be regarded as serious.
It Is the practically complete displacement of
tha Spring Valley Water "Works as a sup
plier of water. It would have to be done to
make the business profitable. It could be done,
however, and private enterprise would not fear
the commercial risk of competition.
Spring 1 Valley Supply -Inadequate.
The condition that might make private en
terprise impossible is of a more serious nature.
The writer personally knows from an exam
ination of the San Mateo reservoirs and tha
records of the reservoirs and water supplies
as declared by H. Schus3ler. chief engineer of
the company, there Is not now water enough
in these reservoirs used together with all that
the company can get from Alameda County and
Lake Merced to supply the city through thÂ«
current Also that a rainfall of not less
than 15 Inches In San Francisco before April 1
will be required to make up the deficiency.
Fifteen inches of rain can come, but it may
not. If not what then ? The grave conse
quences you write of will be on the city.
The mischief will be done before any steps
foward averting it can be expected from
private enterprise. "Whether it would be bet
ter for private enterprise to provide a water
supply or for the municipality to provide It
would hardly be a practical question. The city
if it would avert the consequences of not hav
ing a water supply at all In time would seem
compelled to act in its own behalf simply be
cause' it could not afford to wait on the un
certainty of private enterprise.

and Its inhabitants during the preceding year.
In the event that any person or persons,
company or corporation shall hereafter con
struct water works for the supply of water to
the city and county and to the inhabitant*
thereof it shall have the right to make to
the Board of Supervisors a format declaration
of Its Intention together with a statement of
Its â¢ money expenditures on account of said
works a3 Inventoried on the ta.ee of said state
ment and thereupon the Board of Supervisors
shall by asent make a verification of the In
ventory and money expenditures and on such
verification being made shall record it in their
proceedings and thereafter the inventory and
money expenditure verified shall be considered
in all proceedings before the Board of Super
visors as having been finally determined and
adjudicated.
The amendment 33 suggested above has been
drafted with ereat care and it Is believed
that its adoption would be constitutional and
not in conflict with the existing statute. Tha
object of the law as It stands Is to prevent
extortion from the Imposition of an unfair
price for water. Why not then agree on and
declare- what Is a fair price and fix it as a
Jurlsdlctional fact in the charter? Twelve and
one-half cents per 1000 gallons 13 suggested as
a fair price. It is about one-half the pr?sent
price of the Spring Valley water. With mu
nicipal ownership a price as low a3 8 cents
could probably be had. but a private enterprise
cannot build entirely on borrowed money nor
can It borrow at 3Vi Per cent.
The fight will soon be on in both houses of Con
gress. The country is flooded with the .specious
statements of the junta. The organization is perfect
and works day and night. The farmers of the coun
try are great; but unorganized, and their side is un
heard except in the papers friendly to their cause. In
each State they should take care of their members of
Congress. How is it with California? How do our
members stand?
That is the compromise to which .the junta intends
to retreat, and it should be resisted just as firmly as
the picket line of free sugar is resisted.
All that is sound and sensible. It is unanswerable.
It states the situation with great clearness. But in
the same editorial the Tribune walks right into the
last ditch of the junta" by saying: "The duty on 'raw
sugar should remain as it is, with one proviso. That
is, it may be expedient 'to admit Cuban sugar on
terms more favorable than those given to other for
eign sugars."
Certain Eastern papers which oppose free sugar
are already proposing a compromise. The Chicago
Tribune says, truly and forcibly, that, the agents of
the junta "will argue that the revenues of the Gov
ernment are too large, and that no-simpler or better
method of reducing them can be found than that of
taking off the sugar duty. The natural reply to such
an argument as this is that tampering with the>sugar
duty to reduce the icvenues has been tried before.
It was resorted to in 1890, so that high duties on
manufactured goods might be retained. The conse
quences were disastrous. " A surplus became a deficit.
The Republican party surely will not be guilty of the
same blunder twice. The revenues are excessive.
The way to reduÂ«e them is to take off the war taxes
which remain on the statute books. These were im
posed with the implied understanding that when the
war ended they would be taken off.- The people
would much rather get rid of them than of a sugar
tax they do not feel."
\ We appeal to the press" of this State to get into
action and" to rouse the people. So far but one gen
eral demand has been made upon our delegation.
They are under instructions to re-enact the Chinese
exclusion law. That is an issue in every Congres
sional district in the State, upon which every member
must answer to his immediate constituency. But
beet sugar is not yet grown in every district. Some
members may yield to the pressure which is pulver
izing a Cabinet and bringing into action the guns of
the War Department, in the expectation of justifying
themselves at home upon the plea that their, districts
were not interested in the subject. But this will not
be a correct statement- Every acre in beets anywhere
in California is withdrawn as a productive competitor
of an acre elsewhere that will yield more profit to its
owner in another crop. The interests of a great State
like this cannot be segregated. They wax or wane
together.
To supply the domestic consumption of sugar in
this country will require 40,000,000 acres of land and
employ thereon 400,000 people. ," Do our members
comprehend the importance of such Tin : industry and
will they stand by it against the War Department,
the generals and the junta? " â â¢
Governor Taft of the Philippines has suggested a
reduction of 50 per cent in the existing sugar tariff
as applied to the Philippine product. The' junta has
seized upon this and is ready .to fall back upon it for
Cuban sugar if routed from their demand for free
trade. The proposition should not be . accepted,
either for the Philippines or Cuba. The California
members should hear from home on this subject.
This Statehas many peculiar interests at stake. Our
fruit and its products need the intelligent attention of
our members, to the end that producers may not suf
fer from sentimental reciprocity planned in behalf
of manufacturers and pleaded. as a means of enlarg
ing their exports. Our beet sugar industry is the
junior of our agricultural family. It adds a valuable
crop for rotative use of. land! As wheat declines
sugar takes its place. Our sugar profit may soon
equal that of wheat and fruit combined. .
HOW do our California members of Congress
stand on free Cuban sugar? Will they not
only refuse to vote for free sugar, but also
stand against any abatement of the existing tariff?--

A resolution heartily Indorsing the
George Washington Memorial Association
In Its efforts to establish a great national
university at Washington, but recom
mending that It make no effort to secure
funds by contribution from schools, was
unanimously passed. A resolution deplor
ing the attitude of the University of Cali
fornia In making Latin an entrance re
quirement to all culture courses was
voted down. The following persons were
appointed additional members of the
Council of Education in accordance, with
yesterday's action, increasing that body
from fifteen to' twenty-five members: O.
W. Erlewine, Sacramento; R. D. Faulk
ner, A. L. Mann. San Francisco; C. E.
Keycs, Oakland; C. C. Van Llew, Chico;
R. L. Sandwick, Pacific Grove: E. M. Cox.
Santa Rosa: M. E. Dailey, San Jose; E.
C. Moore, University of California; S. F.
Black, San Diego.
Great interest was aroused among the
members of the association this morning
by the developments of the history de
partment papers. Unstinted criticism
was pronounced against the notebook
system now obtaining in the State, espe
cially with reference to the reQuirements
for entrance to Stanford University. One
of the strongest papers in disapproval of
this system was presented by Miss Edith
Jordan, teacher of history in the Salinas
High School. Miss Jordan is a daughter
of President David Starr Jordan of Stan
ford. Professor R. D. Hunt of tho Uni
versity of the Pacific and an eminent au
thority on history, addressed the history
department on supplementary work in
local history as an aid to the study of
general history.
Tbe afternoon session was called to or
der at 2 p. m,. and the first exercise was
a demonstration of the methods of teach
ing music in the primary and grammar
grades by Milton L. Lawrence of San
Jose, the talk being illustrated with songs
rendered by a chorus of 200 children from
the Pacific Grove and Monterey schools.
The closing business was then taken up,
the annual reports of officers and com
mittees being presented and adopted. A
noticeable feature of the treasurer's re
port was a recommendation that the as
sociation take action at the next conven
tion to fix a permanent meeting place and
that such place be San Francisco or Los
Angeles. This recommendation was made
for financial reasons.
In the kindergarten department Dr. H.
V. O'Shea, professor of pedagogy in Wis
consin University, made his farewell ad
dress before the members of the conven
tion, speaking of the kindergarten as an
organized factor in elementary education.
He said that the kindergarten In this
country Is at the crisis of its existence
and that in his belief the devotion of Its
teachers for its methods would carry it
through. Dr. C. C. Van Llew of the Chtco
State Normal School also spoke upon the
same subject.
PACIFIC GROVE, Jan. 3.â The work of
the thirty-fifth session of the California
Teachers' Association ended this after
noon. Department work of an Important
character occupied the morning hours,
each session being; largely attended.
Senators Foraker, an(J Hanna' both re
main continually in touch by long dis
tance telephone with their friends here.
While Foraker. will have no opposition
for the Republican nomination ior Sen
ator,- the name of Charles W. Baker of
Cincinnati ; and Judge A. W. Patrick of
New Philadelphia will both be presented
for the Democratic nomination for Sen
ator, with the odds in favor of Baker.
While Dick, Cox and others are after
recruits their lieutenants are having live
ly times in ' holding their men in line.
Members : on both sides are accompanied
by friends wherever they gc, even to their
meals and to homes. There are sentinels
about the hotels and about the railroads
to see that none gets away. Representa
tive Willis turned on his escort to-day
and. publicly, denounced the "organized
espionage 'on both sides." , He afterward
attempted ': to start a movement to drop
both Price and McKinnon and take up a
new man for Speaker.. , -^
The Price men' concede McKinnon only
twenty-nine of what are called first, last
and all the time men. But conservative
onlookers say that each has thirty-three
of that class and that each needs at least
two more. George B. Cox, who is the di
rector general for Price, said to-night: '
"There are still seven doubtful Republi
can Representatives. We need two or
three of them, and the others four or
five."
"We gained two in the declarations of
Blnckley of Perry and Fisher of Medina
to-day, and we want a couple more."
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 3.â On the eve
of the Republican caucus the so-called
Foraker-Hanna contest over the organiza
tion of the Ohio Legislature is an open
battle, with neither Price nor McKlnnon
assured of the thirty-five .votes necessary
for the Republican nomination for the
Speakership of trie House.
While McKinnon and Price are claiming
thirty-seven votes each their managers,
who "keep books," are more conservative.
Congressman Dick, who is director gen
eral for McKinnon and the Hanna fac
tion, says:
A protocol with Costa Rica identical in
form with that with Nicaragua, except In
the matter of price and territory leased,
has been In course of negotiation, and it
is understood that a satisfactory - conclu
sion wilt be reached with that Govern
ment. â¢
No exact information is obtainable as
to the price specified in the protocol as
payment to Nicaragua for the grant to
this country. It can be stated positively,
however, that this price is much less than
was expected when the negotiations be
gan, and it is considered by officials as
reasonable. It is understood that at the
outset the view in Nicaragua was that
$20,000,000 would be a proper figure for
the grant to this country and about
$5,000,000 for Costa Rica's â¢ grant. But
while there is no information as to the
final sum in the protocol, it is known to
be far short of the above figures. As the
cession takes the form of a perpetual
lease, it is probable that the protocol In
cludes the feature of an annual rent as
part payment. * Â¦
Besides the authority of American
courts and of the American police in the
six-mile zone, the chief features of the
protocol are in giving a lease in perpetu
ity of this tract to the United States and
at the same time giving an American
guarantee that the Independence, sover
eignty and integrity of Nicaragua shall
not be disturbed by the rights thus con
ferred upon the United States.
The entire policing of this large tract
also is placed in the hands of the United
States, so that it has the power to pre
serve order and after that to issue judic.al
processes extending throughout the zone.
WASHINGTON,, Jan. 3.â Some of the
main features of the protocol between
the United States and Nicaragua referred
to in President Zelaya's message to Con
gress have, been made known in recent
press dispatches from. Managua. But
there" are many other important features
which have not been disclosed, one of
these being the complete American juris
diction and the establishment of Ameri
can courts, civil and criminal, throughout
a zone six miles wide, extending from,
ocean to ocean, and including the pro
posed canal terminiâ Greytown on the At
lantic and Brito on the Pacific.

steamer Tellus says that never in his ex
perience has he seen such an enorm:JS
.ground swell as Is now prevailing: along
the coast. It is breaking right up on
Tatoosh Island, and the roar of the surf
can be heard for miles. "I never saw it
so deep before," said the captain yester
day. "We had fine weather all the way
down the coast, but the swell was some
thing terrific and there must have been
a hurricane somewhere off the coast. I
think you will hear of many disasters bo
fore the month is out. Off Tatoosh there
was a big sea running, and from the dis
tance It looked as though the rollers were
breaking clean over the spot. I made a
good offing and had really a fair weather
trip all the way."

TO ARRIVE.
JAMES McKEttNA of
ff ~ the whaling steamer Fearless has
(I again played in hard luck. A tel-
egram to the Merchants' Ex
change reports his vessel a total
less on the shore at Dutch Harbor, tut
luckily the crew was saved and many
of them reached Seattle on the steamship
Bertha.
The Fearless was the last of a once
numerous iieet owned and managed by
Captain >icKenna- In 1891 he sent north
the brib., Alexander and W. H. Meyer,
the bai~s Northern Light, Hunter, Â£>ea
BreÂ«ze, James Allen, John F. West and
the schooner Bonanza. The Alexander
went ashore, the Meyer was never heard
from after sailing for the Arctic, the
Northern Light and Hunter were sold for
debts and later were lost on the ftome
coast, the Sea Breeze was wrecked on the
Alaskan coast and the James Allen in
the southern seas; the John P. West was
burned off the Hawaiian coast, but the
schooner Bonanza is still at work on the
coast.
Nearly all of the vessels named were
lost within a year or so, and Captain Mc-
Kenna, in order to recoup his losses, de
cided to go into steam whaling. He ac
cordingly went to Norway and purchased
the steamer fearless, which he took di
rect to the Arctic. Ill luck again pursued
him and he came home without having
made expenses. Then a number of his
friends got together and the Fearless was
once more commissioned in March last.
During the entire season only one whale
was taken, and HcKenna was comiru;
home, a broken and disappointed man,
when the disaster occurred. A number of
her original crew was not aboard .when
she went ashore. William Mogg, first
mate; H. C. Slate, third mate, and Chris
tian Sten, fifth mate, remained at He' - 
schel Island, while John H. Whitham
came home some weeks ago. All the
other members of the crew got ashore at
Dutch Harbor and were taken to Puget
Sound on the Bertha.
The Fearless was a bark-rigged. steamer
of 146 tons burdep and flew the Nlcara
guan flag. She was built in Norway in
1SS3 and was 116 feet 5 Inches long, 25 feet
2 Inches wide and 11 feet 8 Inches deep..
A dispatch to Madison, Bruce & Sel
lars, the agents, says: "Captain of the
steamer Bertha informs me that the
Fearless went ashore in Dutch Harbor
and that twenty of the crew returned
with him. He thinks the Fearless will be
a total wreck."
THE WELL, KNOWN STEAM WHALER FEARLESS THAT WAS- WRECKED LAST MONTH IN DUTCH HAS
BOR. SHE WAS THE LAST OF A ONCE NUMEROUS" FLEET OWNED BY CAPTAIN JAMES McKENN.
AND HER LOSS MEANS PRACTICALLY HIS RUIN.

.^v^THE HAIR BRUSH.
Breeds Dandruff, Which Causes Fall-
ing Hair and Finally Baldness..
Prof. Unna, Hamburg, Germany, Euro-
pean authority on skin diseases, says that
dandruff is as contagious as any other
malevolent disease, and that one common
sourcs of the spread of dandruff is the
use of the same hair brush by different
persons. The way to avoid catching
dandruff or any other disease from an-
other's brush is to insist on the use of
Newbro's Herpfclde. It not only kills the
dandruff germ, but it is also an antisep-
tic that will prevent the catching of any
disease whatever through contagion of
another's brush.

As a method of settling difficulties be
tween two parties, at the congress a sug
gestion was made that delegates repre
senting governments favoring compul
sory arbitration sign a treaty embodying
The Hague plan and an independent
treaty requiring compulsory arbitration.
Another hitch has arisen, the "exact
character of which Is not understood, and
a deadlock has taken place. The State
Department is trying to settle the differ
ences, but apprehension Is felt that this
time it will be unsuccessful and that the
congress will after all come to an Inglori
ous end. .
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.â How to pre
vent the Pan-American Congress from
breaking up In a row Is a problem which
the State Department is now trying' to
solve. Several weeks ago the delegates
of Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Peru,
Bolivia, Santo Domingo and Venezuela
were on the point ot withdrawing be
cause of the unwillingness of the remain
der of the republics to accept the plan
contemplating compulsory arbitration.
By the exercise of careful diplomacy
Secretary Hay was able to keep them in
the congress. The United States has an
nounced its support of a plan Identical
with that adopted at The Hague, and this
has met with the approval of Chile, Co
lombia, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua,
Salvador, Hayti and Mexico.

court costs. Giles, whose ear was badly
bitten, will have a piece of flesh taken
from his arm and grafted into his ear.-
He says the physcians have agreed to do
the job for $150.
The mayhem at Garfield was the result
of a drunken row. Cox and two compan
ions went to Garfield and announced that
though it was a prohibition town they
would run it themselves. Theyyissued an
edict tabooing white shirts. Giles came

REDDING. Janv 3.â What looks like a
horrible murder was committed at" Kes
wick during Thursday night. At 1 o'clock
this afternoon the dead body of Terry
Rogers, a miner, aged 35 years, was found
in a cabin he occupied on a mining claim
half-way between Keswick and the rail
way station. The man's heart â¢ had been
blown to pieces by half a stick of dyna
mite placed on tho body and touched. off.
The ownership of the mining claim was
disputed by John Metcalf, a carpenter at
Iron Mountain and George Craig. Met
calf wanted no one to occupy the cabin,
but Rogers was living there. Metcalf is
said to have sworn Thursday that he
would blow up Rogers. Metcalf was ar
rested on suspicion by Constable' Kelly
Friday afternoon. He had three sticks
of dynamite in his pocket.
It is believed that some person stepped
Into the cabin while Rogers slept Thurs
day night, laid a piece of the stick of
dynamite on his body, lighted a. fuse and
tied. The heart was torn out, but the
body was not moved from the bunk. The
supposed crime suggests an Ingenuity
truly fiendish, for Just enough of the ex
plosive was used to kill the man in a
hideous manner without blowing the en
lire body to pieces. It must have re
qulrfd great cunning to enter the cabin,
place the charge, lay the fuse and fire
It without awakening the victim or caus
ing him to stir.
The only other theory Is that of suicide
and this is considered untenable.

. LTURAS. Jan. 3.-The mystery
i\ that has for months surrounded
' lj\ the lynching of Calvin Â«Hall. his
Â£ i\ three eons and Dan Yajitis. at
Lookout, in this county, Is now
to be uncovered and those who were
guilty of the terrible crime will undoubt
edly be brought to Justice with a rapidity
calculated to amaze the most criminally
hardened among: them. ' i â
This has been a day fruitful of sensa
tions in and out of court. The Informa
tion is abroad to-night that one aud prob
ably more of the witnesses in the trial of
Brown, who is accused of having been a
leader of the lynching mob, have turned
State's evidence and will furnish In court
every detail of the tragic story.
One of these men is believed to be John
Hutton. All day long he has been re
quired to remain in the Grand Central
Hotel, and during the entire morning As
sistant Attorney General . Post was closr
eted with him. So important was this
conference that Judge Post was unable
to attend the opening of court and sent
a request that a recess be taken until 2
o'clock In the afternoon.
"Whether as a result of this' conference
with Hutton or for some other reason
thirteen men were . arrested to-night on
complaint of Mary Lorenz, the daughter
of Calvin Hall, who was the principal vic
tim of the lynchers. These persons, who
ln the woman's , complaint are charged
with the murder of Hall, are B. S. Trow
brldge, Orrin Trowbrldge, Frederick Rob?
erts, J. J. Potter, Claude .Brown, J.' R.
Myers, Joseph Leventon, A. L. Colburn,
William McDaniels, Henry Knox, Louis
Polmanteer, Claude Marcus and Jerve
Kresge.
The arrest of these men, the significant
action of the prosecution and the pros
pective unveiling of the truth which con
spirators here have so zealously sought to
conceal, have 'come as thunderbolts out
of a clear sky to disturb the peace of
mind of the persons who assisted in the
crime. Alturas will be awake for the
greater part of this night discussing the
momentous developments- of to-day, and
preparing for the worst v that is promised
to happen. -

and was immediately granted. The after

The examination of Lafe Harris, the
vaquero, was continued. He testified un
der cross-examination . that he did not
hear George Courtwrlght say that he was
to get $500, as claimed by the defense.
The court and Attorney Raker for the de

argument on the court's [refusal? to let
Raker ask certain questions on cross-ex
amination and the court accused , Raker
of many offenses, general Post and Raker
then accused each ;other of making | mis
atatements of the testimony and the court
charged Raker ' with ungentlemanly .con
duct. Raker appealed to the record, but
he was not allowed to have It read.':
The next witness, George Howell, stated
that he was in Levontoh's blacksmith
shop at Lookout on I Monday before the
lynching | and that Joe Levontoh j and

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3.-James' Paley,
an orchardist living, at Alhambra, Is in
a strange predicament. He has discov
ered the fact that although he is pos
sessed of "all his faculties and has never
been deprived of his freedom and liberty,
according to legal records he has been
an inmate of the insane asylum for /sev
eral years. . "-â¢'-â¢Â¦: ';'â¢Â¦Â¦'Â¦'..-' :/ - 1 :-t-.^
A few days ago Paley negotiated a real
estate deal and ordered an abstract of
title. The abstractor made the report
that while the title in Paley appeared to
be all right, that j gentleman could not
give a deed to the property, as the rec
ords showed that he had been adjudged*
Insane and committed to the asylum, ana.
it would be necessary to have a guardian
appointed in order to have a transfer
made. â¢ . Â¦-.,./-
It appears that the man In the asylum
is not James Paley. but Joseph H. Ander
son, his brother-in-law. In September,
1897, Paley became convinced that Ander
son had lost his mind and swore to a
complaint to that effect. Anderson was
examined by a commission and was
found to be Insane. But in drawing up
the papers | and writing - the records the
clerk gave the patient's name 'as James
Paley instead of Anderson, and he was
eentito the asylum under that name.' The
mistake was 'hot' discovered until the ab
stractor examined the Â¦. title Â¦ .to Paley's
property. Paley has engaged ' an attor
ney to take the necessary legal steps, to
correct the records and make him master
of himself- once more. ,', â¢ â¢

Mrs. Roosevelt introducing her daughter.
The latter presented a charming appear
ance in a dress of white chiffon, with
white roses, and wearing the jewels which
her father gave her at Christmas. Mrs.
Roosevelt wore pure white, with white
lace and trimmed with lilac orchids. Miss
Helen Roosevelt; a cousin of the Presi
dent, and who also was one of the immedi
ate party of the hostess, wore white chif
fon with white satin ribbon,"" and -Miss
Cuttin white lace trimmed, with mulle
and white roses. Miss Roosevelt was the
recipient of many floral pieces in beauti
ful design, sent to her in commemoration
of her "coming out" day. The President
enjoyed the occasion heartily and mingled
freely among: the young folks.
When the ball was opened to-night the
interior of the White House was most
attractive. , Never before have the floral
decorations been more beautiful. Tha
massive mirrors, chandeliers, columns
and ceiling of the east room, > where the
dancing occurred, were â¢ festooned and
garlanded with smllax, maidenhair fern
arid asparagus trimmed with bouquets of
carnations. 'More; than a mile of green
festooning was used in this way. The
window recesses were filled " witn palms
rising out of banks of variegated foliage.
The mantels were banked with roses and
azaleas set in tropical cretons and
crowned above with screw pines. Eng
lish holly was used in profusion ln the
decorations. The red, green and blue par
lors were adorned on the same lavish
scale.
Miss Koosevelt is the first WhitÂ© House
debutante since 1873, when Miss Nellie
Grant, the daughter of President and
Mrs. Grant, was presented to society at
a ball which was the gayest social event
of the decade. To-nignt's entertainment
was given a personal rather than an In
formal character by Mrs. Roosevelt,
whose wish was that Miss Roosevelt
should make her debut much as though
it had taken place in her own private
home, rather than in the White House.
There was no cotillon and consequently
no favors.
WASHINGTON. /Jan. 3.-Miss Alice
Roosevelt, eldest daughter of â¢ President
and Mrs. Roosevelt, was formally pre
sented to Washington society to-night at
a ball given In her honor at the White
House. About 500 guests were present,
many of whom were either connections
of the Roosevelt family or well known
society people living outside of Washing
ton. v

Army Surgeon C. S. Beverly became so
deaf from catarrh that he was forced to
resign his position and abandon his pro-
fession. " He says: * "Of course " my in-
herent professional prejudice was hard to
overcome, but knowing of the great bene-
fit you^had received, my dear General,
through the use of Stuart's Catarrh Â¦ Tab-
lets, I usedi them. The great and almost
immediate ' relief I â¢ experienced was truly
astonishing. I am now; entirely cured and
have no fear of the disease returning I
go back to my old post next month " '
â¢ Stuart's Catarrh Tablets have Â¦ done 'It
fio'do^it, :will do it. Try - them -and be
convinced. Â¦: They are for sale at any drug
store at 50 cents a box. It will put you
to very little trouble or. expense to prove
what they will do for you. . Send to F A
Stuart â¢ Company, 'Marshall, Mich., for
their: free book about "catarrh." A -postal'
card will bring itVWrlte to-day.
Mrs. Jane Barlow, the famous modiste
says: + "'I finally had to give up personai
attention to my customers,' and In conse
quence many of them went elsewhere I
was In despdlr for specialists seemed pow-
erless to help me. - Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets cured me in just â¢ a little while so
completely that now I hear as well as
ever."
That Stuart's Catarrh Tablets do ef-
fectually cure catarrh of the eustachian
tubes; and^the head noises and deafness
resulting therefrom is attested by the fol-
lowing: : .
were . intended for them. What happened
to them is 'of frequent occurrence and in
three cases out of four might have been
prevented by the use of Stuart's Catarrh
Tablets. These tablets cure all kinds of
catarrh. They can be bought in any drue
store for; 50 cents a box. ,. â¢. B .
'.Two : . acquaintances - of ' the â¢ writer i were
run , down and killed i by the ' cara ln one
year. Both r had catarrh Â¦ of <Â¦: the Â¦Â¦Â¦ head,
which 'had extended "up the . eustachian
tubes, leading from the throat to the mid-
dle ear, and were quite hard of hearing.
In both '. cases the coroner's 'Â¦ Jury; decided
that : they came | to . their death because of
Inability Â¦ to hear and heed â¢ signals Â¦ that
'Â¦- It , should be â¢ understood and constantly
borne In mind that to restore. the hearing
and silence the distracting noises a treat-
ment-is required that will allay inflamma-
tion; in .the. eustachian tubes, reduce; the
congestion and swelling an,d stop the se-
cretion â¢ of . mucus so that - the . tubes : will
be and' keep open for the free passage of
air Into .the middle ear. : No locally ap-
plied medicine will effectually do ;this,
only a searching constitutional alterative
and resolvent will : cure < catarrh . in " the
deep recesses of the head.*3jAHVÂ£gBÂ£; .' ;i,
, Nine cases out of /ten of head noises and
progressive -hardness Sof Â¦ hearing, are due
to catarrh of the"middle ear or of the tube
leading from it to the throat.
'.In nearly every case of partial or. 1 com-
plete deafness there Is another feature
that Â¦ to many Is more ' troublesome â¢ than
the difficulty of hearingâ the distracting
head' noises. Â¦ These Â¦ make such an * im-
pression on some as to almost drive them
insane. Â¦ The everlasting buzzing, ring-
Ing, snapping, rumble or roar - distracts
them by day and prevents rest at night.
Impairment of hearing robs one of many
of the Joys of life, exposes to danger, In-
terferes with capacity . for usefulness,
limits abllity-,to transact' business and
earn a llvlngr Many annually . abandon
their plans, ambitions and hopes . on ac-
count of loss of hearing.

Interstate Commerce
Commission to Begin
Investigations.
CHICAGO, Jan. 3.â The Record-Herald
to-morrow will say: -The Interstate Com
merce Commission will begin a series of
three investigations in Chicago next Tues
day, which Is said . to have for its
purpose- the gathering- of data for a spe
cial message by President Roosevelt to
Congress. It is said that in this special
messagevPresident Roosevelt will deal
with tnreo subjects, as follows:
Firstâ Railway combinations.
Second the Interstate Commerce Com
mission.
Thirdâ Legislation governing interstate
traffic
Originally it was the purpose of the
President to cover these subjects fully in
his annual message to Congress, but ow
ing, to the Inability of the Interstate
Commerce Commission to get all the facts
necessary, these subjects were touched
upon but briefly, and were left to be han
dled In a supplementary message. The
investigations which will be made, and,
which will supplant those already made,
are:
. 1. Tuesday,' at Chicago, the transportation
of packing-house products and dressed beef.
Â¦ 2. Wednesday, at Chicago, the Burlington-
Northern Paciflc-Great Northern combination.
3. Thursday, at Kansas City, grain and
grain products to Eastern and seaboard points.
4. Friday, at Chicago, packing-bouse prod
ucts and dressed beef.
United States Marshal Ames' deputy'
was busy to-day serving and trying to
serve subpenaes on representatives of
packing-house interests. He had six sum
monses and succeeded in serving two.
Several of the men sought are said to
have escaped service by leaving the city
hurriedly, one of them missing the deputy
by only a few seconds.
While the packing-house men are ap
parently shunning the investigation, the
railroad men are not seeking to avoid it.
Many of them believe that anything is
better than the present conditions, and
that with stable rates would come lower
rates, to the great benefit of the entire
country. The packing-house men who
were served with subpenaes are: George
B. Bobbins, president of the Armour car
lines, and W. B. Jenkins, superintendent
of transportation for the Hammond Pack
ing Company. No subpenaes were issued
for the railroad men. but in their stead
letters were received from the commis
sion requesting their attendance at the
Investigation.
It is said that every person In charge of
traffic on a road centering here and known
to carry packing-house products and
dressed beef has received a copy of the
letter.
It Is understood that the legal counsel
interested In the organization of the
Northern Securities Companyâ James J.
Hill. E. H. Harrlman, J. P. Morgan,
former President Hays of the -Southern
Pacific, President Bur.t of the Union Pa
cific and.J. C. Stubbs, traffic director for
the Harriman linesâ have been asked to
attend. None of these men were subpe
naed, but Darius Miller said that he ex
pected to respond to the commission's re
quest, and it is presumed that others will
do the same. -
It Is also the purpose of the commission
to inquire into the purchase of the South
ern Pacific by the LTnion Pacific and Into
all that has transpired within the last
year as tending to show the workings of
the community of lnterets' idea.
Railroad men have .been given to un
derstand that the Investigation Into rate
matters is not for the purpose of inflicting
punishment upon any one, but simply in
the line ot - Investigation ' for facts and
data. This fs understood as confirming:
the purpose of tho President to send a
special message to Congress.

going from one place to another, Chief?"
â¢ ''Well, we will have . to wait until we
reach the destination," said Sullivan. "But
as far as the police are concerned, I think
the Chief will find some means of meeting
the difficulty. As a rule enough apparatus
and noise attends a fire to give a general
Warning. The first day of the- new sys
tem, which is a negative one at. the best,
'will find its first operation to-day if there
Is a fire. Then experience will do the

Chief Sullivan of the fire department and
Chief Wittman of the police \ department
entertain different ; ideas- on the new sys
tem of whistle-suppression. :No longer
will be heard the terrifying fire whistle.
Chief Wittman thinks the new plan
adopted by , the Fire Commissioners is
neither feasible ' nor . practicable. ... Chief
Sullivan is of the opinion that all will go
well, and time will prove him right.
"I don't see how it can work successful
ly,", said . the Chief of -Police yesterday.
â¢'Policemen, must. go to the fires ..to keep
the crowds back and to preserve ord^r.
How are they to find out when there is a
fire? No, sir; it's not practicable." +
Chief, Sullivan is more, optimistic. "We
have been preparing for the abandonment
of the whistle alarm for three years.-
Where the men are accustomed to get
shaved orto eat, or where they live, fire
alarms will be placed, so, you see, no in
convenience will result on that score."

A suggestion by B. J. S. Cahill that the
balance -of the fund raised for entertain
ing the soldiers and sailors who returned
from the Philippines be placed at the dis-~
poEal of the memorial committee elicited
a reply from the Mayor that there was
the sum of $25,000 on hand, and that it
would be used to erect a monument to the
Californians who died in serving In the
late war.
The time in which sculptors may send
in designs was fixed at ninety days. On
motion of Irving M. Scott, Mayor Phelan
was authorized to appoint an executive
committee of five, the Mayor and officers
of the committee to be ex-offlcio members
of the executive committee.
As Mayor 'Phelan will shortly leave on
a vacation he asked that a vice president
be elected. The committee gave the honor
to Irving M. Scott.
The committee adjourned to meet at the
coil of the presiding officer.
In order to raise the balance of the
money needed lists will be prepared and
letters sent to prominent citizens. It is
expected to raise $10,000 by this means.
Treasurer Murphy stated that a certain
number of gentlemen were pledged to
make up whatever balance is required
when the public subscriptions cease.
Vouchers -were ordered paid for $500.' in
cluding postage, printing and the salary
for two months of Secretary Ross, whoso
service? will now be dispensed with. .
More Money Is HÂ«quired.
Location for Monument Selected.
A communication was received from
Mrs. Zelia Nuttall outlining plans for a
park museum, to cost $400,000, and sug
gesting that if certain citizens would do
nate that sum of money that a suitable
memorial to the late President could then
be erected in the shape of a "McKinley
Lecture Hall."
The letter of Mrs. Nuttall was received
and a suitable reply was ordered 6ent to
her expressing sympathy with her view3,
but regretting that the memorial com
mittee was unable to accept the sugges
tion.
It was decided by the committee that
the memorial to the late President Mc-
Kinley should take the form of a monu
ment or statuary, and that all sculptors
in California Bhould be asked to send in
designs.
The committee decided that it would not
award prizes to competitors, and that de
signs should be sent to the Hopkins Art
Institute.
The question of the location of the me
morial was then taken up, and in order to
guide the sculptors in making their de
signs and for the information of the pub
lic the committee resolved that its present
cense was that the monument should be
erected at the junction of Market street
and Van Ness avenue, where it might
be constantly viewed by the public and by
all who participate In processions.
Mayor Phelan announced that 2179 sub
scribers had donated to the fund, exclu
sive of the general donations of the school
children. , ,
Treasurer Murphy reported that the
subscriptions on hand amounted to 530,
304 S4, and during the meeting a further
donation of $300 was received from, the
Chinese Six Companies.
It was the unanimous sense of the meet
ing that the sum of $50,000 should' be
raised in order that the monument to the
late President might be worthy of his life
and also of the city. Mayor Phelan de
sired that the public might learn through
the press that the subscription lists had
not closed and would remain open for an
indefinite time.
The treasurer was authorized by the
committee to place the money on hand in
the savings banks of the city.
The committee appointed to secure
funds for the erection of a monument In
this city to *he late President William
McKinley met yesterday aTternoon in the
office of Mayor Phelan. In addition J.o

ble women would only leave off coffee
absolutely and try Postum Food Coffee
they would "find a wonderful change In
their life. It would then be filled with
sunshine and happiness rather than wea-
riness and discontent. And think what^n
effect it would have on the family, for the
mood of the mother is largely responsible
tor the temper of the children."
"My husband and little daughter were
subject to bilious attacks, but they have
both been entirely free from them since
we began using I'ostum Instead of coffee.
I no longer have any headaches and my
health is perfect.
"About five years ago a friend urged me
to try Postum Food Coffee. I made the
trial and the result was so ' satisfactory
that we have used it ever since;
Mre. C. K. Larzelere, Antlgo, Wls., says:
"I was taught to drink coffee at an early
age. and also at an early age I became a
victim to headaches, and as I . gTew to
womanhood these headaches became a
part of me, as I was scarcely ever free
from one.
Coffee blots out the sunshine from many

ether member cf the household, dyspeptic,
nervous and Irritable. There are thou-
sands of cases where the proof is abso-
lutely undeniable. ; Here is one.'

renewed confidence in the "â¢ new 'year "are the
dominant features in the new industrial, com

naturally been quiet , to f the : verge . of Â¦ dullness
as regards new business."" the main attention be
ing concentrated in gathering, up" the threads
of old business, 'Â¦ in stock-taking and in prep
arations for the future." . 'â¢Â¦.'Â¦ .; '
A conspicuous' exception to the" general quiet
ness is : found , In the. Iron . and ; steel 'situation,
which gains rather than loses activity. ' , Here,
however, the car shortage question cuts'a'dis
turblng figure, and' one whiclv inview'of ithe
advanced stage of -Â» the -season,' "â¢bids 'fair,; to
continue to unsettle both production and con
sumption considerably. Â¦â¢Â¦- Supplies X)f â¢ coke : at
the ovens are piling up,* but the Â¦Â¦ blast Cumaces
are shutting down because : of tho^ necessary
link between 'Â¦Â¦ the two, an abundance of 'cars
not being forthcoming. Southern pig iron 'has
advanced 60' cents per ton and - the Western
trade is - getting Its chief supplies from this

Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says of the
lumber trade: j
The Lumber Trt
"The last month of 1901 saw the ending of
one of the most prosperous years the lumber
manufacturers and dealers or this coast have
ever participated in. The sales all over the
West have been exceptionally heavy, . while
prices have .been forging ahead since the mid
dle of the year. All sections of the coast have
benefited by the improvement in the lumber
trade circlas and every class or dealer is feel
ing that, at last, there is some reason for him
to exist.
"The last six years have not been* over and
abave happy ones for either the manufacturer
or the merchant, as the current quotations have
been lower than they should have been and the
margin of normal profit was readily eaten up
by the prevailing high shipping rates. Mills
were in danger of being closed down all along
the coast and in the interior. This year, how
ever, saw all this â¢ altered Â£nd conditions of
trade are greatly Improved.
"The redwood mills are overcrowded with
orders, and in many instances overtime pay
allowances are being made to the employes.
Eastern â¢ and foreign demands are responsible
for this state of affairs and the tendency is
toward radical increase along all lines. The
almost total absence of dried redwood lumber
in this market and at the mills is responsible
for the turning down of many large and re
munerative orders from all sources, but the
feeling in all the companies, with the possible
exception of one -or two offices. Is that a gen
eral increase in their plant capacities will ad
vance the interests of the redwood companies
of the State. This is the right kind of feel
ing to encourage and it is to be hoped that
the coming season will find this work well
along .toward completion. The redwood men
are encouraged at the current aspect of trade
and the opening of 1902 finds them hard at
work in their endeavor to solve the problem of
keeping up with their Increasing range of or
ders.
"The sugar pine field Is rushing along now
CX far as orders are concerned. The mills are
ell closed during the winter season, but the
demands are corning in for thousands of feet
that cannot be filled during the entire season.
The Pine Association is proving a. great suc
cess and illustrates what can be done when
perfect understanding is reached among the
manufacturers in any line of trade activity.
Eastern buyers have been rushing about this
city endeavoring to have their contracts
signed, but have been generally met with
answers that such heavy orders cannot be pos
pibly met at this season. The result is that
Inquiries are coming in for pine timber lands,
but St is found that there are few if any acres
of this valuable land in the market.
"The retailers are all rushed with orders
for the building " trade of this city and its
vicinity is crowded with contractors' orders.
Realty reports show that over 3500 buildings
are in course of erection in San Francisco,
v.hile L06 Angeles and the other secondary
coast cities are encountering the same issue
All in all the close of 1001 finds the lumber
manufacturers crowded with orders and the
prevailing prices about the best that can be
expected for some time to come, even though
the receipts of lumber from the Pacific North
west were over 30,000,000 feet and the redwood
deliveries practically doubled over the record
of last month."
New York Stock Market
NEW TORK. Jan. ;3. â The preliminary - fig
ures of the weekly cash movement furnished
by the banks themselves gave; assurance that
the return flow of currency from the channels
of " domestic trade has set In In" force.' .There
-was a quick response in the. money market,
where enormous offerings of funds carried the
rate down to tf per. cent Standing : loans were
already marked down to that rate at ' the re
quest of the borrowers. Â¦ This Is exactly ' thÂ«
development that the recent rise In stocks was
intended to anticipate; yet' the stock market
yielded to-day to overwhelming offerings to
realize profits and ended at a level substan
tially below, that of last night. There were
points of strength during the day, - and the
speculative liquidation was kept well In hand
with the assistance of the strong spots in the
market, which were in part due to manipu
lation. There was a palpable shifting of spec
ulative accounts from Reading into United
States Steel, but there were evidences of sim
ilar transfers at other points in the market.
Early in tbe day the strong points predom
inated over the weak ones, but the profit
taking became general as the day progressed.
The transactions in United States Steel were
on an enormous ' scale and the stock held its
advantage. Local traction stocks showed
strength, led by Brooklyn Rapid Transit, which
Is one of the few stocks on the list which
started this year at a price far lower than It
did last. There was strength also in a.num
ber of central traffic "and Southwestern rail
roads. The .Wabash stocks were conspicuous,
and the Toledo, - St. Louie and Westerns were
unusually active on rumors of absorption by
the Vandertoilt interests. On the other hand,
all the recently prominent speculative â¢' favor
ites were under acute pressure. - These in
cluded the coalers, especially Reading, the
grangers and - Pacifies. : An advance of 3% in
Great Northern preferred and bidding up ' of
Northern, Securities Company on nominal tran
sactions in the outside market failed to deter
speculators from selling the Pacifies. There
was nothing in the day's news of sufficient im
portance on the side of depression to acocunt
for the reaction and- it was attributed purely
to realizing of speculative profits. This devel
opment rather - discredited the â¢ recent theory
that the latest strength of the market was
due to support by great capitalists and bank
ing interests with a view to , prosecution of
future projects and seemed to put the profes
sional stamp ' on the . recent '.bull , movement
The easing of the money rate was accompanied
by sales of foreign exchange and the simul
taneous relapse of Sterling exchange in Paris
narrows the margin toward the point of profit
in gold . exports. A further cut in - the price
of copper was a slightly disturbing factor and
the report of requests for extension " of ac
commodation by a large promotion syndicate in
Ohio received some consideration. The . mar
ket closed active and easy at about the lowest.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
. Potatoes are very firmly held, and the gen
eral market continues In good shape. Receipts
from Oregon are light. Five cars of Salinas
Burbanks came in late Thursday, and one from
Oregon yesterday. '
Onions stand about the same.
There are two or three cars of Sweets on the
track which are unsalable, being frost-bitten,
and they will probably be dumped. There are
now no good Sweets on the market -In first
hands. -. - ',
Peas and Beans have been accumulating since
the - holidays, and as the dally receipts are
heavy' and there la a good deal of frost-bitten
stock offering, the market is weak. *
The following new rule3 of the Produce Deal
ers' Protective Association, relative to sales of
Potatoes and Onions, have just gone into effect.
Heavy penalties will be Imposed for- violation
of these rules: .
. Rule 1.. No member of this association shall

cisco. ..i ... : . ';..-.
Rule 2. No member of this association shall
buy any potatoes or onions located In the city
and county of San Francisco from any one who
is not a member thereof.
â¢ Rule 3. No member of this association shall
sell or Issue an order for less than fifty sacks
or boxes : of potatoes, or . twenty-five sacks of
onions, .on any wharf, bulkhead, boat, or from
any car or railroad station .In " the Â¦ city and

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Hay and Feedstuff s:
The fizzling out of the rain has left the
Hay market very firm, and' local .dealers re
port sales quick. at full figures. Holders are
very confident of a strong market as long as
the dry weather lasts, and refuse to make any
concessions. They say that the market is $2
per ton lower than at this time last year," with
lighter stocks, and the smallest rainfall in
December since 1878. In addition - there are
large shipments to interior points, such aa Ne
vada and northern mining: districts. , and the
South is expected to enter the market as a
buyer soon. Under these circumstances the
tendency of the market is decidedly upward.
Sales at $12 50 are reported, and all fine wheat

Arter an experience of some eighteen years
the St Paul - Trust Company has found that
the conduct of the trust business, under condi
tions and restrictions existing here, has been
unprofitable and has decided to liquidate Its
affairs, to accept no new business and within
two yeans to retire from the field entirely.
AH Â«f the fund to ths credit of the trust ac
counts. Including all agency business, has long
been set aside, as required by law. In deposits
separate and aDart from Its own â¢ moneys, so
that any or all of them can be paid on de
mand at any time. "With its other creditors
it has arranged to go into voluntary liquidation
and undertakes within two years to convert its
lie sets, which are largely * in real estate, now
beginning to be salable, and to satisfy all
claims against It. and expects to thus wind
up Us affairs fully, amicably and honorably.
The most serious case against the com
pany, however, was that of the estate of
O. D. Stronz, whose estate showed a de
preciation of more than $100,000 during the
ten years it was in charge of the trust
company. The Supreme Court held that
there had been no criminal impropriety,
of action In handling the- Strong estate,
but that the trust company must make
good the $100,000 depreciation in the value
of that estate, such falling off in value
having been in real estate which the
company, as trustee for the Strong es
tate yurchased from itself as owner of.
such property. It Is stated that the com
pany will be closed up by new officers.
The assets of the company consist
largely of real estate and notwithstand
ing the depreciation in realty values dur
ing the past few years the assets still
l->reely exceed the liabilities. The total
assets are given at $510,574 in the last
published statement of the company. To
day's action was taken with the consent
and approval of all the creditors and the
Public Examiner was simply notified of
the action taken, not having taken _any
official part in the discussion of the direc
torate J. W. Bishop, president of the
company, late this afternoon issued a
statement, in which he says:
The company has carried on an exten
sive business and administered several
large estates, the greatest having" been
that of the late Commodore Norman Kitt
son, who left five or more millions, - the
last action on his big property having
only recently been taken. There has been
much litigation of this estate, the "heirs
contesting the trust company's claim for
compensation and securing a big cut in
the amount claimed.
Public Examiner Pope made the an
nouncement of the company's decision at
noon, stating that from his knowledge of
the trust company's business he believed
all creditors would be paid in full, al
though the stockholders probably would
lose part of their investment.

In his opfnibn there" was some: evidence
that the killing was the result of'a'pre
concerted'conspiracy, .and there was evi;
dence of a meeting of the petitioners pre
vious to the commission of the crime twitH
those' who committed It, and there was
evidence :- of, 1 contradictory statements
made by them, from which the 1 commit
ting magistrate" might"' 1 be justified In
drawing conclusions., Under section 31' of
the ; Penal Code', all persons Concerned in
the commission -of. a crime were princi
pals, whether -they aided and- abetted . in
its commission Â¦" or whether, -.not being
present, >they had advised ' and encour
aged'its'commission." ; â¢ \" . Â¦ " . Â¦'
- It certainly, could not 'â¢Â¦ be' said- that the'
record in the'ease was devoid of: evidence
upon' which the magistrate might have
concluded that these defendants, although
absent at the time of the commission of
the crime,' did advise and encourage it.'- Of
course,' if -'they, -did advise and" encourage
it they were concerned in Its commission,
and whether they were on the car or not
and whether they were present, at all; or
not would-'be immaterial: . they. 'would
still, under section 31 of the Penal Code,
be principals In ' the crime 3 committed.

PRODUCERS' OIL EXCHANGE.
The lectures,; which ; commencefl^thelr
twentieth ' annual*, course j last- evening,"
were designed by Dr. Lane that the pub-'
lie might.be lucidly informed of matters
pertaining.to- health. ,1 I . . -t*
The college,' the speaker s4id.- has- beten
wisely fourfded ,to instruct men and-wo
men to perform' very necessary Â¦ duties , to
their fellow men' and the lecture hall was
conceived that errors ,.'; and -^prejudices
which were . detrimental,'might be dis
pelled and that- the people might be guid
ed by the' philanthropic-. lectures. .-.Tlie
lecturer then pictured the pestilential vis
itations and the consequent fatalities of
past' centuries, /when dire.' diseases ; were
heralded by^disturbancesof the elements
from Asia to -Â¦ Africa, . thence to- Europe.
He described the ravages, wrought by the
white. and the black plagues when mil
lions of lives were sacrificed, .when'nox
ious vapors brought death/when putrlfied
locusts in swarms even darkened the sun,
The' ravages in the Orient were* terrible
and in European countries- the visitations
of the black plague proved no.lesÂ»vshock
ing.- The doctors of those times, , heroic
as they x were. had admitted their Inability
to cope ; with' the pestilence, but medical
science in these times had so far advanced
and with. the. intelligence -of the people
that the plagues could never repeat .them
selves again. ' ' .
The lecturer proceeded â¢ to thrash with
his logic those who opposed, or would op
pose, ."'the' progress" of medical science.
Me extolled Jenner and by figures, au
thoritative statistics i showed the advant
age of vaccination and applauded the pro
visions that required that all. children at
tending schpols must be vaccinated. He
desired- to prove to those whofeared vac-:
cination that at this period there was
absolutely no danger since the cultivation
and the- preservation of virus, was abso
lutely: perfect and. he wished -that .Cali
fornia would adopt â¢' the ' vaccine farms,
such as they have in. the East and North-,
west. He had no sympathy., he said, with
the class. that would put obstacles in. the
way of the good order of thingsâ "the an
ti-viyisectionlst," "the anti-humanitar
ian" ; and "the anti-vacdnationist."
.* : Dr. Â¦ Ellin.wood in regretting the enforcea
absence of -Dr., Lane -through: lndlsppsi-*
tlon spoke of his great; andi good work in
the Interest of medical science "and there
by Â¦ for the . good ; of the , people. ; -Â»S -â¢ '.: Â¦ Â¦ . . Â¦
Â¦ Epidemics were . diagnosed and Â¦ micro
scopically examined into last night at the
Cooper Medical \ College . ty.J Dr- c: N; BIt

Dr. Henry Gibbons owing to the' absence

Supervisor Curtis will probably remain
'.n his present position as chairman of the

of Booth, whose record < as the -head - of
the Printing Committee has given, great
satisfaction to all elements.' 'Branden
stetn is slated for the 'chairmanship of
the Finance Committee, which is general
ly regarded as the stepping stone to the

the same- position, but it* is .practically
settled that, he will . be ' given the chalr
fchlp of the Judiciary Committee,; of
which he has been . a member for two

head of the -Water Committee, .while
Dwyer will continue as of old at the head
of - the Fire Committee. Boxton ; will be
chairman of the Police Committee, of
which Tobin was the. head. It is hinted
lbat Braunhart is also seeking the same
honor,, but the . disposition is' to . pjt
Braunhart at the â¢. head of the- Public
Utilities '; Committee. < D'Ancona Â¦ is the
logical head of the Hospital Commlttf e
and his selection- seems- a, certainty. The
minor committees - will -. be ; divided ' among
the new Supervisors, who are in the min
ority," and therefore in no position to
make demands for Â¦ the more influential
committees. -'.
Board of Supervisors last night. â¢ There
were present Messrs. Alpers, Bent, Booth,

I Brandgnstein, Payot and Sanderson were
absent; Neither Mayor Phelan nor
'Mayor-elect Schmitz was : in attendance.
While the primary object of the meet
ing was to give the members ' of the in
coming board an opportunity 'of making
each other's acquaintance, considerable
time' was devoted to the discussion: of the
personnel .of â¢â the various - committees of
the board which are to be made up. TKis
duty, is generally performed by the mem
bers who agree among themselves as to
>he chairmanship of the committees. This
accomplished they are formally, presented
to the board by. the Mayor for ratifica
tion.
â¢ Although no deci.ied rivalry for the
more important committees, 'such as
water, gas, fire, police and . streets, ' has
thus far manifested itself,. there is a hard
fight being waged. in secret by various of
the - holdover members for the principal
honors. After an hour's discussion last
night it was apparent that no agreement
could be reached, and on , motion *_â¢ of
Supervisor Booth, Chairman Braunhart
appointed a subcommittee of six to make
up a committee list and present it to tbe
majority of the board for action after
the meeting on.; Monday next. The com
mittee consists . of Messrs. Braunhart,

He was living in Massachusetts at the
outbreak of the Civil War, and in Octo

December following he was ' made first
lieutenant, his regiment being at the time
attached to General N. -P. Bank's com

the spring of 1862 he was ordered to Ship

telegrams to the Chiefs of Police of Port

be on the lookout for him. All day yes

books of Marron, Taut as far as is known
there was nothing wrong discovered. The
wife of the missing shipping clerk still
clings to her belief that he is the victim
of foul play. Â» Â¦â¢: â¢ â¢ . -
She discredits the story that he was
seen boarding a train for the north, and
challenges the informant of the police to
prove his statement that he met her hus
band at the Sixteenth-street station.
Marron, according to the police, has
been leading a gay life, and, expecting
trouble, left the city, deserting his wife
and infant boy.
, "I am up against it," he is said to have
remarked, "and rather than disgrace my
wife and child I- am going to Seattle. I
intend to do what is right."

death was inflammation of ."the heart and

inflammatory rheumatism. He is sur
vived by a widow and married daughter,

Seamans was prominent as a member of
the G. A. R. and Loyal Legion. Tbe re

under" the escort of .Douglas 'White of

ASKS DAMAGES FROM -
THE UNION IBON WOBKS
Russian Company . Alleges That
Steamboat Machinery Built for It
.. Has Latent! Defects.
Suit was filed yesterday In the United
States Circuit Court by the Union Com
pany, a Russian corporation, with head
quarters at Blagoveschensk, Siberia,
against the Union Iron Works of this city
to recover $32,050 damages alleged to have
been sustained by reason of a /violation
of a machinery, contract. The. com plaint
recites that" the defendant contracted, to
build, certain machinery for a steamer to
run on the Amoor River, the machinery to
be delivered, at -Vladivostok, and that by
reason of latent- defects in. the machinery
it was unfit for the uses intended. In con
sequence of such defects the steam, cylin
der of the engine exploded while UÂ»e
steamer was on the Amoor River, neces
sitating Xhe landing of the cargo on the
river bank and causing damage to the ex
tent of $32,050. John H. Miller is attorney
for the plaintiff. . . - '
Hunter Dismisses His Suit.
The j suit of James Hunter against
Thomas Pollard, Calvin Stewart and other
directors of the v Bear Harbor Lumber
Company to recover $400,000 damages for
alleged mismanagement of the company's
affairs was dismissed yesterday on mo

Finds Half Horses.
Assistant Secretary McCurrie of the So
ciety for the Prevention of. Cruelty to
Animals states that he found a number of
horses-belonging to George Green in a
half-starved condition in the Gum Forest
yesterday. Green could not be located
but it is said that he will be arrested for
cruelty as soon as-possible..
Mayor Phelan, before retiring from pub
lic station to taste the sweetness of
private life, will appoint a Park Com
missioner to succeed Colonel Walter Mar
tin. If he were so minded he could trans
fer the responsibility of choosing Colonel
Martin's successor to Mr. Schmltz. but
the outgoing Mayor is keenly sensible of
the fact that the incoming Mavor will
have a world of trouble in distributing
the official patronage which rightfully be
longs to the new regime.
Park Commission the Test.
As Colonel Martin is a Democrat it may
be argued by the Jeff ersonians' that Mar
tin's successor should acknowledge al
legiance to the Democratic party. It is
common belief in San Francisco that the
park board is the best commission that
Mayor Phelan appointed. It is good, cer
tainly in one respect.- The Mayor could
not exact a promise of the commissioners
before their appointment and could not
force obedience to his will afterward.
There Is strong belief that Mr. Schmitz
will pay tribute tp Phelan's sound judg
ment tn the selection of Park Commis
sioners by reappointing John A. Stanton.
Here is an example of harmony. Stanton
is an artist' with brush and palette -and
Schmitz is an artist in music. Art is at
last in the ascendant.
Will Demand Office Next Monday.
The opinion of the City Attorney that
the Mayor and other officials elected in
November last cannot be inducted into
office before January 8 will not change
the purpose of those elected to visit the
City Hall Monday noon and make formal
demand for the places to which they were
respectively chosen* The law' seems to
be plain enough that the present regime
was elected to ser,ve for a term of two
years and having taken office on January
S. i900. are entitled to hold until 12 p. m.
of January 7. Acting on the advice of his
counsel Mr. Schmltz will present himself
at the Mayor's office Monday next and
signify his readiness to relieve Mr. Phe
lan. The Mayor-elect is advised that fail
ure to appear at that time might result
to his disadvantage in the event- of a
court decision that his term of office be
gins on the first Monday after the first
day of January.
Other members of the board were not
favorably inclined to Fay, although will
ing to appoint a successor to Russell. At
all events the scruples of at least ten of
the Supervisors have been overcome and
the resolution will be introduced next
Monday. The resolution will be adopted
immediately, and unless some hitch in
the proceedings occurs Fay will be pro
vided with a comfortable billet of $300 per
month- The resolution will be introduced
by : Supervisor . Braunhart. who acts ; for
the Mayor In little matters of this de
scription. . v.\ â¢
. The programme decided on some weeks
ago to appoint Charles Fay \ to succeed
John A. Russell as clerk of the Board of
Supervisors will in all likelihood be car
ried out at next Monday's meeting of the
board.' This will be the final meeting of
the Supervisors and will be the last
chance Mayor Phelan will have to secure
a soft berth for the man who has been
his private secretary ever since the late
William Sullivan resigned the position
to become Chief of Police.
At the last meeting of tne board Mayor
Phelan, in adjourning the meeting over
until Monday morning instead of tne aft-,
ernoon. as is the usual custom. - signifi
cantly said that there might be some
business to settle up in the event that the
City Attorney should decide that the in
coming city ofhcials should assume office
at 12 o'clock noon on Monday instead- of
on Wednesday, as he has 'since decided.
It i3 quite likely that his Honor had in
mind. the prospective appointment or his
best man to the responsible position held
by Rutsell. N
An attempt was to have been made one
month ago to supplant Mr. Russell, who
has been a sick man for months and un
able to attend to his duties. Some of the
Supervisors were averse to ousting Rus
sell, who has served the city faithfully
for more than thirty years. They felt
that it would be in bad taste to dismiss
a man who lies- on a sickbed from which
he will probably never arise.
The residence 'of Julius Gall, 2131 Broad
way, was entered on New Year's night
between 8 and 11:30 o'clock. AH the mem
bers of the family and the servants "had
left the house, about the former hour.
When the members of the family returned
'it, was at once seen that some one had
been there during - their absence. Every
room in the house had- been. visited. Bu
reau drawers . had- been .thoroughly
searched for plunder, and even the mat
tresses, on the beds had been thrown on
the floors. \ â¢Â¦Â¦'Â¦'
Among the articles of jewelry stolen
were a pair of diamond and torquolse ear
rings, Â¦ a. ; diamond Â¦ and â¢Â¦ sapphire N ring, a
lady's gold watch and neck chain, a
lorgnette and- pair of opera-glasses, gold
link cuff buttons, gold key chain and oth
