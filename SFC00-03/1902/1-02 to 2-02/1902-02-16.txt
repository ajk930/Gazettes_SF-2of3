It â¢ is not always delicate; to mention
names when one is describing underwear,
but it may be stated that a certain Wash
ington woman has a nightgown which Is
arqund the shoulders upon a ribbon,
which Is run through an openwork of
lace. .
It can be pulled up as high as one de
sires, or tied loosely, so that it is very
low in the neck. This article is put on
over the head and there is no opening
down the front. It is floor length and is
finished with a' ruffle as fancy as may be>
desired. "
-Over this is worn a little white lawn
jacket, also very - sheer. This comes to
the waist line, or not quite so low, and
Is cut on the order of the kimona jackets.
There is no fastening in front and the
neck has a sailor collar, usually of lace.
Then there are lace cuffs. This covers
and supplies warmth to the throat and
the arms. Attired In this one Is surely
conveniently clad and prettily clothed.
Those who enjoy going to bed attired so
that, in case of emergency, they can
emerge without feeling as though they
were shocking their every day- conven
tionalities will admire the nightgowns
that are cut from pale, pink, pale blue,
butter color, champagne color and ab
sinthe green lawns. . These delicate tints
are trimmed with lace and make im
mensely becoming nightdresses.
There is a very fashionable New York
woman â¢ whose nightrobes are in black
sheer goods, finer than any web, and
made up, oh, so delicately with colored
laces and with white. One's repugnance

There are straight little band cuffs of

which is run ribbon of ; two-inch width.

Tubbing Your Gowns.
Have you ever tried the experiment of
tubbing, actually tubbing, your nice room
gowns. Do try it, even though they be
not recognized as wash goods.
The life of a handsome little bouse
gown, or negligee, is practically unlim
ited, for it can be worn again and again,
then laundered and worn again, until
there is not a rae of It left.
A woman of much taste in dress con
fided to a friend that she could wear a
tailored suit three times as long as her
neighbors. "The minute I come Into the
house I take It off," said she, "and never
for an hour do I sit down with it on. In
its place, fresh from my best dresser, all
scented and beautifully trimmed with
lace, I take a negligeeâ an elegant little
affair it Isâ and with 'this on I feel that
I can face the world until It Is time to
dress for dinner."
The possession of a negligee Is some
thing that should be coveted by every
woman. Few there be who do not own a
loose robe of some sort. If no more than
the old fashioned wrapper, but this Is not
enough, for there should be the carefully
planned, highly artistic negligee; and
there may well be two or three.
The negligee, besides being so very be
comingâand who can afford to slight such
a consideration as thisâ is really an eco
nomical investment. It saves one's hand
some and more expensive gowns and pre
serves them for the occasions for which
they were intended.
alternate strips of ribbon and lace com
ing into a' band with a lace ruffle at the
wrist. At the bust there is a big bow of
albatross with long ends all trimmed with
lace. -
A Negligee Is Economical.
The underwaist is made sometimes with
a long friil below the waist and some
times without. There are arguments in
favor of both. If the material be very
thin and fine, the frill be not too full, it
will really not make the hips a great deal
larger, bo the objection is almost removed.
The underwaist is belted almost univer
sally with a ribbon which Is put in
through little slits in a special insertion
whidi comes for the purpose, or it is run
through a linen strip which can also be
procured for the purpose of threading rib
bon. Soft liberty ribbon ties readily, does
not crease and takes up little space, but
it must be pulled out for the laundry for
it is not a wash ribbon. - .*â¢'-Â¦

The Stylish "Cover."
H is going to be another season of very
thin gowns, and in the buying of a very
fancy corset cover the spring shopper
shows her discretion. In a few days it
will fcc- time to put on a ribbed cottton
Gown, one of the lovely little new prints,
;ind then she will discoverâ this woman
cf fine tasteâ that there is an aggravating
little openwork rib running through the
cotton soocs and that the corset cover
shows through. So the cover becomes
really an unaerslip or underwaist, and as
such it is pretty to call ! t.
If Ehe must buy plain ones, the woman
of any ingenuity at all buys at the same
time a litt.e German lace, and all the way
home plans how she can use it to make
her a pretty cover. When done she has
transformed a "quarter" cover into a $2
one.
Those wretched little tight-fitting cor
set covers, plain with an edge or so, and
maybe a little strip of insertion, which
Â»eie the lot of other days, are now for
goiten. Beautifuhy trimmed ali-in-one
l-iiece covers adorn the counters and hang
from the display lines and are selected
by the woman of taste to wear under. her
gown.
When she goes out to buy stie takes
with r>er a certain portion of money for
the under-the-gown wear and she spends
it right royally, buying not so many but
so nice! '
undergarments of the plain cotton vari
ety, but it is certain that the beginning
nf-ths-century woman will do no such
thing.
It is impossible now, at a casual glance,
and even at a searching, one, to discover
the difference between a nightgown and
a negligee, though the' latter may be da
signed for breakfast wear. * The woman

The Pretty, Negligee.
.Then . there are ,the umbrellas, which
this year are differently shaped. The legs
are wide, extremely wide, and on the
lower edge is set a very wide ruffle of
ribbon run with lace. Embroidered ruf
fles are coming In with a monogram set
above the ruffle on the outside of the \eg.
Oh, such lovely things these are, a temp
tation surely to the needle-loving womanâ
Â¦and to the money-spending one!
Those garments which the little girl
called "my panties" were made very wide
at the knee. The garment is nicely fitted
at the hips and along the leg, but. just
above the. knee a flounce is set on. It 13
not applied in the straight round-and
round fashion, but' it is shaped, growing
wider at the outside. This calls for a pe
culiar cut to the leg and the flounce is set
on very full. Two yards wide each were
the flounces applied to the legs of a love
ly nainsook set, looped with pink liberty
satin roses, on the. outside of. the "leg.' Â¦Â¦.
Straight flounces are put on! but the leg
Is curved upward on the outside, so that
there is a pagoda effect, the outside being
much shorter than the inside, thus expos
ing the garter.: This is a stylish cut- and
will be liked by those who enjoy being
stylish in all things. The pagodas have
very wide flounces, rather deep, arid set
on in the fashion described. ; â¢. ..-
.The night robe was trimmed with these
fat little ribbon roses all the way down
the front from the chin to the floor, and
the little under-petticoat had a deep lace
ruffle, looped at short intervals , .with
roses the size of a dime, all in ribbon.
The other articles of underwear are
trimmed to match. A little .set of ' six
pieces, including the very short knee pet
ticoat, was trimmed with lace and ribbon,
the latter disposed in the form of fat lit
tle roselike choux. . These .were, placed
upon the outside of each leg, where they

was very high, and upon the bust of the

from a school girl friend, will be a set of

monogram and trimmed with flowers em.
Â» Â¦ - . . â¢
The one piece covers are literally a mass
of trimming. Lace of wash variety is
inserted and allowed to run all the way
around the cover. Then comes lace of aji
other variety. Cluny, Valenciennes, fine
torchon, Brussels and half a dozen others
are used, sometimes as many as four dif
ferent kinds in. one cover. Then at the
waist there Is a ribbqn to tie!
If the cover be cut off at the waist line
the ribbon Is wider and is flattened out
around the figure, just above the belt
line, and hooked in front so as to do away
with the bowknot. Other covers that are
cut off above the waist are fastened with
such narrow baby, ribbons that there Is
no bulk at all in the knot, even though It
Is tied directly In front.'
Chapters and chapters might be written
upon these covers, for they are a, neces
sary part of woman's dress and 'of her
adornment and are of that variety of un
derwear known as both useful and orna
mental.
The new "covers" are made all in one
piece, seamless, and without sleeves of
any kind. Ribbons go over the arms and
tie on top of the shoulder. With dinner
and evening gowns these ribbons are very
useful and even ornamental, for there is
no calamity if an end happen^ to peep
forth, while the .distressing vision of a
muslin shoulder strap is one that has
dawned upon all who attend dress func
tions.

form the middle of the rose.-
Such a charming trimming. Roses grad
ually growing larger toward the bust, un
til they grow from button roses to moss

top of the underwaist. That such a mir

$ The very sheer goods, the lawns, cam
brics, nainsooks and India muslins, are
not so desirable for negligees, for the rea
son that they "show through" and one
must wear a display garment underneath
But if one fancies that sort of a robe one
can wear a handsome corset cover and a
beautiful petticoat, all arranged to be
seen through the negligee. This ts correct
as far as good taste is concerned.
Â¦ Of petticoats there must be a word
said. These are offered In such profusion
in the shops that one need only go in and
name one's price in order to be suited./

and got your skirt cut out at your dress
maker's, have you not spent as much as
though you bought the skirt outright?
There is, however, something that can
be done at home, and that Is the making
of the petticoat that Is silk half way up.
The upper part of this is of colored lawn

coat, with a silk ruffle. Is lovely and it
arrords a use for the poplin gown which
hangs in every wardrobe and which re
fuses to wear out. though it is the heroine
of many a season.

they -furnished absolutely no clew to the
real personality of .the original of the

repeatedly , to ' tell ~ who ; she was,' but he
only, smiled" and looked wise. When he
answered at all he said:
the throat and through which tie ioft
skin of the shoulders is faintly outlined.
With this the hair Is worn in a loose
wavy coiffure, held in place on top of
the head with a big butterfly of black
and silver. The effect of the whole toilet
is sufficiently striking without any fur
ther elaboration, but the daintiest touch
of originality is yet to come.
When she is fully dressed Miss Jeffrey
has sprinkled over her hair fine particles
of silver dust, which are permitted to
sift through the heavy curls and fall on
the fair skin of the delicately rounded
throat and * shoulders. A few : grains are
also 'dropped on the bare arms from the
elbow to the wrist.
Under the bright electric lights of the
parlor or dining-room the effect is in
describably beautiful. The silver dust
glistens in . her hair and scintillates from.
the fine mesh of lace at her throat and
bust ;' like a thousand tiny jewels ever
changing and shimmering In new lights
as she moves about the room.

just out of 'reach of the. dogs. An old
male baboon saw this and came alone to
the rescue. Slowly and deliberately he
descended, crossed the open space and.
stamping his hands on the ground, show
ing; his teeth, and backed by the furious
barks of the rest 6f the baboons, he dis
concerted and cowed these savage dogs,
climbed, on the rock, picked up the baby
and carried him back safely. If the dogs
had attacked the old patriarch his tribe
would probably have helped him. Burch

zebra - is named, . let his dogs chase a

hundreds. This was done, and the holy
monkeys were deported in covered carts
and released r many. miles off. But the
monkeys were too clever. Having thor
oughly enjoyed their, ride they all refused
to part with the carts, and hopping and
grimacing came, leaping all the way back
beside them to the' city, grateful for their
outing. One city obtained leave to kill the
monkeys; but. the next city then sued
them for "killing their deceased ances

The dogs are taught by means of dum
my figures made up as much as possible
to represent the thieves and dangerous
characters they may be likely to meet.
How much patience is needed by him whoW
undertakes this particular form of educa
tion only those who have tried to train
animals will properly appreciate. The dog
must be tausht to seek, *to attack, to
seize and to hold, but without hurting
seriously. The first step Is to place the
dummy in such a" position that it shall
represent a man endeavoring to conceal
himself. The dog soon understands that
it is an enemy whom he must hunt, and
enters into this part of his lesson con
amore,' but it is hot so easy to teach him
not to injure it- The teacher lowers the
figure to the ground and the dog learns
that though he may not worry his prey,
ha must not allow his fallen foe to stir
ao much as a finger until the order Is
given.- After the dummy. a living modal
is used, and as this process Is obvious
ly not entirely without danger, the per
son chosen for this purpose Is usually he
who ministers to the pupil's creature com
forts, and for whom the canine detective
is sure to entertain a grateful affection.
Nevertheless he is prevented at first, by
means of a muzzle, from an exhibition of
too much zeal. Afterward the experiment
is tried on other members of the force
and In four months .the dog's education
as a policeman is considered complete and
he takes his place with the rest. The
animals are also taught to swim and to
seize. their prey in the water; to save liifcs
from drowning; to scale steel walls, and
to overcome all obstacles, so that any en
terprising burglar who goes "a-burgllng"
in Ghent has a lively time of it if he
meets with one of these four-footed "bob
bles."
It is at Ghent that the dog has become
a recognized member of the regular town

COLONIAL GOWNS OWNED IN SAN FRANCISCOWhite Ants That Delight in Eating Up Houses
THE termite, or white ant. stands
alone for destructlveness. By in
habitants of both the East and
West Indies, in fact of anywhere
between the tropics,- it Is considered
to be the greatest plague of those plarue
etricken regions.
Not long ago an English resident of the
East Indies returned after an absence of
some five months to his country bouse
near the seashore. On his arrival be found
everything in apparently first-class order.
Accidentally he struck, with no great
force, one of the door posts; a small piece
rave way. and a hole was made which
ihowed that the Inside was hollow.
Further investigation showed that, the
irhole house had been reduced to a mere
ibell. and that It must fall in the next
high wind. The Englishman realized that
the ruin of his house was the work of the
white ants, and knowing the thorough
ness with which they do their work he
instantly had the house closed and his
neighbors warned.
When the house was knocked down, as
It was some few days thereafter, it was
found that almost all the woodwork ex
cept a* thin external crust of the timbers
and boards had already been eaten away.
The furniture had not been unmolosted, al
though in every case the outward appear
ance of. the articles was as though they
had not been touched.; Y \
The termites perforate and . eat into
wooden buildings, utensils and -furniture,
and if their progress be . not stopped in
time they totally destroy them as far as
further use is concerned. Only metal and
glass can escape ; their ravages. .
Their favorite food is wood, and so large
a number can congregate at one particu

that the destruction of ? a whole 'apart

WHERE woman's coiffure Is con
cerned the curl is still queen.
The height of its power seems
not yet to have been reached,
in spite of a season's reign. In
a \-ariety of new forms this little fas
cinator bids fair to hold sway over femi
nine fancy and the hearts of the opposite
MX.
Never did woman add more potently to
the charm of her evening dress than
when she borrowed from the ladies of the
court of Louis XVI this accompaniment
to the low cut gown. There are few types
of beauty which It will not adorn* with
advantage.
The curl seems to adapt itself to the in
dividual Jty of every owner. It is sweet
and girlish for the debutante, and, in an
other form, adds dignity to the -matron.
It is stately, coy, artistic or conventional,
as each case demands.
In any form the low coiffure , takes ten
years from a woman's age. This Is one
reason why she will cling to . it as long
as Dame Fashion will at all permit. Then
it is undoubtedly true that this form of
hairdress is far more becoming to the
majority of women than is the hair worn
high.
A leading artist in this line explains it
very simpiy: "In the low coiffure the
hair is drawn -back very much as nature
intended it should fall. It is reasonable
that this should be more, beautiful -on
most women than when the hair Is drawn
and caught in directions nature never in
tended'it should be. It Is difficult to im
prove upon nature.",'
But it is the talli stately woman who
benefits most from the low coiffure. She,
indeed, never entirely forswears fealty
to it. even when the high' artificial effects
are in vogue. 1 . The hair worn low, with an
evening gown, hides the defect of a neck
which , is rather too long as nothing else
can do. For the young girl whose^neck
is still a trifle too slender or undeveloped,
the hair; gathered in a knot, high oh the
head,"! and then falling, in a curl or two
to' the shoulder line; gives the necessary
roundness and full*; effect. Only "those
whose necks approach perfection" of form
can afford to despise the beauty giving
touch of the curl.;- Â¦ . ' Â¦Â»'.
For the woman who finds it necessary . to
add to > her apparent' Inches 'the proper
effect of ; height is obtained 'with i the ' low
coiffure by waving the hair high about the
forehead before drawing it back. It is the
endless variety of the front nairdress that
make's the low coiffure possible with any
type of face. .'; /Â». 1
Wave Is Imperative.-
A wave \ there always* isâ that is essen
tial. And it should be a loose, natural
wave. Not hard or crimpy. \ Indeed, from
the face to the i coil is one immense wave
in! all the smartest coiffures. But the wave
may, flow back Â¦ smoothly from the face,
or, equally correct, .may rise to; the pro
portions of a pompadour about the face.
The newest curl Is much shorter and
more slender than formerly. That known
as the "Janice Meriedith," a heavy bunch
of curls falling over the shoulder or far
down the back, is decidedly passe. In one
of the latest designs the i hair is waved
back all over the head, that' which falls
being divided into two long curls. , These
are now "caught -up loosely and entwined,
so as to produce the effect of a bow, with
large loops and small ends.
The loops are i then fastened . flat and
low down ; on the head Â¦ with . large shell
combs, one comb holding each loop. The
short -ends form two little curls, which
hang daintily from beneath, barely reach
ing below the neck. When the hair Is too
Ions to make only the one bow, It la still
further entwined and pinned down over
the back of the head in the game ribboned
effect.
The appearance Is full and soft and flat.
In all the smartest -designs now the aim
Is to make the coll fit low and dose to
the back of the head, no matter to what
helgrhi It may be puffed on top. Nothing:
Is more important than that . a hard,

MILADY'S WINSOME CURL. IN A VARIETY OF NEW FORMS IT AGAIN HOLDS SWAYAnother fancy dance that is more. than,
pretty was taken from the Spanish. It Is
called the "Vienna Waltz." The "numer
ous mannerisms and customs that have
come into being with our new possessions
are all there. It is distinctly the 'bolero
movement and the waltz. The dancers
Now that the waltz and two-step are on
the^wane the really old dances that have
been practically forgotten are picking up
their heads and. wondering, how much
chance they would have If they tried â¢ it
again. Probably the gavotte will be in
strumental in bringing the five-step into
popularity. , â¢ â
The two-step is then added, and after
several steps the same positions are gone
over and over again. The dance is then
conquered, and it only remains to keep it
up and to do it gracefully."
' While the "Florodora nod" is somfr
thing not so very new, it is sometnihg
very catchy and intensely fascinating.
The "Twentieth Century Gavotte" if
also the old and the new. It is the old
military schottische and the rollicking
five-step. The dancers take the first popi
tion that suggests the kick, and after
several steps in the fashion of the grand
march they change to the second, which
is exactly like the pose taken by children
in playing "London Bridge." With this
the side step seems to be taken, although
it is difficult to find out exactly what it is.
The dance finishes in the ordinary waltz'
position, and the five-step again adds
vivacity to it
"Florodora nod." And when this nod ia
given by a particularly fetching girl j it â¢
works havoc with the heart strings of the
partner.
The turn is the difficult part The par
- ticipants dance toward each other, ? join
hands and the man turns the girl under
his arm exactly as Is done in some of the
games that children play.
After the first few steps the couple sep
arate and dance away from each other
and over their shoulders giveHhe pretty
little salute so commonly known as the
This "Unique" was suggested by the
eertet in their famous turn. If you re
member how the sextet left the stage you
will know exactly what the first position
Is. Each man offers his partner his arm,
and they take a few steps after the fash
ion of the six. It looks easy, but it is not
If you think it is whistle the music and
try it There !s : a kink in it that defies
the first attempt at mastery. Time and
time sxain the same little hitch occurs
until on* is ready to give up end shout
"I don't want to dance the nasty thing
yjCnyway." And then it comes all in an
instant and you wonder how* you could
ever have been stupid enough not to have
caught on Instantly, For when once mas
tered it is the most simple thing imagin
able.
Perhaps the most popular of all the new
ones is the unique dance. Everybody
and everything went "Florodora" crazy,
and the costumes and then the dance it
self was borrowed in the whole or in bits
just as the fancy willed.
But don't neglect nor entirely forget
the waltz and two-step, for they are not
to be relegated to the past That could
positively never be; for they have won
for themselves an established place.
Strange as it may appear to old dancers
that place is now distinctly in the back
ground, and the new dances have prece
dence. *
These days children commence studying
graceful movements almost as soon as
they can toddle, so these new poses are
in a way not new nor difficult to them,
but to the average girl who swaggers
about with two feet of silk sweeping the
floor these frills seem something new and
more than difficult
There is one 'bad thing about this sud
den change. People who have been whirl
ing about in waltzes and two-steps much
longer than they care to or can-remem
ber would better hire a hall and a compe
tent instructor and work hard and furi
ously. For you see to know only the old
dances, unless they date as far back as
the minuet, is a most dreadful give-away
of your age. And if there is one thing
a girl hates to tell more than another it
is that all eventful date, unless there are
only summers.
The two-step and waltz held sway so
long and so exclusively that when the
tide turned it swept the standards more
than half way out. The picturesque came
in with a rush and a bang. Pretty fig
ures and odd combinations are the dis
tinctive characteristics.
Our good grand dames .would have
thought we were all going to perdition
if they Â£ad known that dances would take
such a hold on the fancy that the styles
would be as eagerly" looked forward to
as are the latest fashions ln,clothes. Such
has been the case this year.
The time has come when it keeps an
army of men and women busy evolving
something new and something striking
enough to take the youthful fancy of our
fastidious light-steppers.
DO PEOPLE look askance at danc
ing these days? Even the most
staid churchgoers no longer frown
on it as an amusement, if the
dancers are graceful and the steps
are not too fancy or too high.

Jfow to forecast the isdeaiher
THE ordinary person makes no dis
tinction between one_ cloud and an
other, though by some meteorolo
gists they are divided Into four dis
tinct groups; the heaped up cumu
lus; the delicate, feathery, curling little
clouds, named cirrus, so high as to be
frozen, often, into minute needles of ice;
the wide-spreading sheets of cloud named
stratus, which, seldom more than a mile
above the earth, often come down to'en
velop qs in fogs of mist; and the dark, un
mistakable nimbus, very toon causing the
water that left the earth as vapor to bo
restored as rain.
The clouds owe thf ir different forms to
different physical states of the atmos
phere, to which are also due the aerial
currents, which often flow in directions
other than the currents or winds prevail
ing close to the earth. '
In weather forecasting no clouds are
worthy of euch attention as the cirrus
clouds, which attain a greater elevation
than any others, averaging in summer a
height of five or six miles above the earth.
Their sudden appearance In a clear sky is
generally a. signal of foul weather, espe
cially when their streamers have an up
ward tendency, for this indicates that the
clouds are falling. After, heavy rains, on
the other hand, the formation of these
clouds Is often a sign of improvement. -
When cirrus clouds appear In summer,
the assumption ii that rain will appear In
two or three days. They are seldom seen
In winter, and never for long:. When cir
rus clouds assume the form of stratus* at
any altitude of four or five miles, 1 their
persistence is an almost certain ;Â¦ sign of
rainy weather. If, on the ' contrary, they
remain of small size, and quickly disap
pear, no change is to be apprehended.
'Among the most significant ; of the cir
rus formation of clouds Is that delicate
white veil called cirro-palllum,-, which is
gradually drawn across Â¦ the sky. -< This,
with Its accompanying lunar and solar
halOB, almost certainly foretells rain and
bad weather for the next day.
Cumulus clouds vary enormously In
size, but so long, as they remain of mod
erate dimensions, In fine weather, they in
dicate a continuance of brightness. But
when, in hot 'weather, they grow excep
tionally large, they give warning of
storms, with high temperatureâ and with
great certainty when they assume a
dome-like shape. - .
The ordinary stratus, the fog of the sky.
Is common In all seasons,, but is generally
observed in the morning or ; evening; It
causes tinÂ© rain, seldom of very long du
ration. *Â¦
None can mistake the nimbus forma
tions, those dark, heavy-looking, masses,
with clearly defined outlines; the certain
precursors of immediate rain.' They may
attain the size of immense mountains of
vapor, the base less than a mile above
the Â¦ ground and the summit as â¢ high as
nve miles. Some nimbus clouds have been
calculated to contain as much as 200 cubic
miles of vapor 1â Pearson's Magazine,

*^i S I am asked to put my thoughts
f | In words, I do so with great pleas
( I ure, as the reader is my first con-
AÂ» I fidant.
My greatest and highest ambi
tion is to travel, but as there are so many
accidents both on the railroad and on
sea I suppose I must wait until'the air
ship is in progress. .
The reason I intend to become a mother
Is because I have been taught that Is
every woman's duty. I shall manage the
household affairs myself, because in doing
so 1 shall know- where every cent of the
money has gone, and will be able to regu
late my income accordingly. -I say that
my husband shall be "good looking" be
cause if he were very handsome he
would be likely to attract other women.
My reascn for wishing to raise : only a
small family is that I can give two chlU
dren more attention and devote myself
more to them than if there were a num
ber to care for. They shall 'attend public
school, tor there they become acquainted
with all conditions of life, and I think It
helps them to be unselfish and kind to
others. They shall be raised in a town
lather than in the city, because city In
fluences are not always beneficial ' to
young children. I shall do my own work
as far as possible, because I Â¦ do not want
to be annoyed by the "servant girl prob
lem," though, on second thought, "when
I gcow up" the "servant girl' problem"
marry must have the qualities of a thor
ough gentleman; he must be good
natured, kind-hearted, chivalrous, good
looking, and an intelligent business man,
and he must also be reconciled to my
mother. I ehould not care to raise a very
large family, two girls being all the chil
dren I want. I shall train \ them with'
much care and send them to a public
school. My home shall be in the suburbs
of Boston, or perhaps in Cambridge. I
shall live in a house of about ten rooms
and shall do as much of the housework
myself as possible.

The idea has been taken up by
San Francisco schoolgirls, but with
out their knowledge that the papei
was to be other than an ordinary ex
ercise. Four localities were chosen
in order to get as varied a class of
children as possible. Certainly if the
children of this age live up to their
ambitions, Uncle Sam can make no
ccmplaints in regard to his citizens.
But the American girl did not
trouble herself about men and dc
xnestic duties. Independence -was her
cry. To have a profession, to make
money, to gain influence and to stand
well with the people of this world was
h.er ambition.
The English girl's main idea was
to advance socially, to please gener
ally and to secure as indulgent a
husband as possible. The German
lassie's bent was decidedly domestic.
Her ambition was to be a thorough
1-ousewife. By understanding the
art' of cooking and the knack of
making a house attractive she itelt
that the best bait was thrown out to
unwary men. In other words, that
those qualities would attract a man
looking for a wife.
THE question, "What I Hope to
Be," was tf.ken up by an Eng
lishman, who, upon investiga
ting the subject, found that the ideas
ci children depended largely upon
their nationality.

me, while the people were laughing and
applauding and wondering what sort of
a freak I might be. They found out in
a moment and the whole house was roar
ing before I had reached the center of the
stage. And you couldn't blame them, for
I looked a sight. The most striking feat
urea in my get up were a blazing red
ehirt and a flaring unkempt beard that
had not been molested for weeks and
months. A bandana handkerchief met
this beard around my throat and served
to set off an old faded suit of yellow

tops turned over down to the knees fin

this picture of a musical miner. I was
hugging my violin and with a slight nod
to the crowd in front I stood and waited
for the orchestra of four or five musicians
to get through laughing and let me have
my innings.
They kept on giggling until one of them
came to his senses and began to give me
A on the piano. I fumbled around and
began to run over the strings; this I did
several times ' and always out of tune.
Then I took off my cowboy hat and ran
my fingers through my hair. Once more I

to an end the house gave vent to Its feel

fairly shake and caused me to smile as
broadly as a miner would have done if
he had struck it rich.
For it certainly struck me that all Daw

I got out into the wings to be joshed by
Billy Bard, but they called and recalled,
so I swaggered out once more- and played
a. Spanish fantasia. This was more showy
and took them, quite by E.ornr, but still
they didn't realize that a simple musician
stood before them.
One man was heard to remark audibly
that "That cove, had never ought to gone

All this time I was in the wings being

present a normal appearance -once more.
The buzzing outside continued, with an
occasional- hurrah and when the man who

make the next announcement they would
not allow him to speak, but called for
more music from "the fellow with the
beard." ' "* !
Finally when he could get a word in
edgewise he told them how they had -been
hoaxed and that they had been listening
to the musical director of the Columbia
Theater, San Francisco, who was in town
: on business and had taken' this mode of
giving himself a little pleasure. Then the
applause, mixed with laughter, broke, out
again louder than ever and I "had to go
out and bow. . ;-'â¢%
After the show I thought I should never
get away alive, so great was the joshing
I received. The very next day I received
an offer of a permanent engagement to
play in the orchestra there at a salary of
$25 a night, for as many nights as I want
ed. Ar.d that was my first public ap
j pearance as a musician in the Klondike,
â¢ and I think every one called it a success.'
Anyway, I shall never forget the recep
tion I got as a miner who could play the
fiddle. .
But I had "other experiences in the far
north which were hardly so pleasant,
among which I may mention the Journey
from Fort Yukon . over the ice to Daw
son. which Mr. Roncovieri, two others
and myself made together. AVe had to
tramp it in, and we slept three nights on
Lake Lebarge, with no protection fram
" the icy ground save rubber blankets.
. That lake is about 150 miles from Skag
way and about thirty miles long. Then
onward we tramped, the four of us har
ntssed up and "drawing the sleigh the
same as horses or dogs. Then I realized
that the Klondike was not exactly the
place to pick out to take a vacation in.
â¢ THat was about the reason that I went
up there, . though. After nve .years of
river carefully on my own account. ' The
Indians call this "reading the water," and
I soon became quite proficient in it.
In that country proficiency means
money for the pilots, for good ones are
paid $20 a day.
On the lower river the Indians are the
best pilots, and they have only to look at
the water and they can tell where it is
deep and where shallow. When I thought
I knew enough to guide my ship aright I
went to the Collector of the Port at Daw
son, whom I knew. He said I could be
made a captain if I could pass an exami
nation and would pay a Canadian to go
along with me to conform to the law.
So that was arranged, and before long 1
â¢was Captain Schmitz of the stern-whee\
steamer Clara, 100 feet long and I have
forgotten how big besides, and soon I bad
her running all over the river.
I remember a pathetic incident that
happened one day in the short days of
September. It was just about dusk and .
Â¦we were chxtrnlng along in the boat, when
I saw a man ~ running wildly along the
shore and making signs for me to come
nearer to the shore. The shore was a
rocky one, but I got there somehow and
he called faintly: "For God's sake take
me on board. I think I am going to die."
I did get him on board the Clara, and
found he was despondent to the verge of
insanity. He was one of the many wood
choppers whose cabins are scattered
along the river. He had been at that
work for six weeks for the N. A. T. Com
pany, alone in the cold and. silence, save
for the company of a faithful dog, . A
week before our steamer had come along
the dog died, and the man was alone in
the wilderness. . , .v,.
It was too much for his nerves and
physical strength and the boat was a
godsend. I kept him. nursed and cheered
him up for a week, and thea-he was ready
to take up his life again. That was only
one of the many sad things that came
Into my experience, and the funny ones .
are the pleasing ones to remember.
Among those I remember for the favors
they extended me in that country are the
Canadian mounted police, as able a body
of men as I ever saw, but about whom
many uncomplimentary things have been
said. They are called the mounted police,
though as a matter of fact- they are on
foot, except in Ottawa or other towns.
In their little stations along the river I
often met them, and I know of many
cases in which they were a great help to
many a poor traveler. That is a country
where it is truly all work and not ranch
pleasure for any one. Lake Bennett and
Tagish Lake are connected in my mind
with the hardest trips we had. There I
saw many men fall by the wayside.
In coming out of the Klondike we left
Dawson on the 13th cf October, and as it
happened it was on a Friday. That cir
cumstance, together with the date, war
ranted everybody in predicting that" we
would never reach White Horse. As It
was we were the last boat that left Daw
son, and the only one that arrived safely.
I had a bet of a champagne supner with
Captain Ritchie of the Canadian Develop
ment Company, who left Dawson Just a
little before us. that he would get there
first. I have never seen him since. His
boat, with several others, got frozen in
the river for all winter.
But as I said before I enjoyed every bit
of my Klondike experience. I was a
hearty Klondiker, and never had a sick
day, save an illness caused by a fall re
ceived 'just before we came out. I d.s
tanced Roncovieri. for he came out three
months before I did. After all. warmth
and civilization are better than gold and Â«
ice for a steady diet. Perhaps the wheel
of fortune may find me in the far north,
again some day-
vulsiona of laughter by this time, but
.they â¢ politely refrained from doing any
thing: worse out of sympathy for: me. I
suppose. They did not know that all the
time I was laughing In my sleeve at them.
Then I thought it was time to do 'some
guying 1 myself, so I started in with a
flourish and played a cadenza. The first
violin in that orchestra put his Instru
ment down and started up over the foot
lights with his mouth open. The tapes In
the audience changed and the Â¦ laughter
died away like a breeze after a storm.
I kept quiet for a moment or so and
ecjoyed watching them from behind my
work at the Columbia, when a company
offered to send me up there to look after
their interests, and not being averse to
a chance to pick up a little gold for my
self. I decided to do some exploring Just
for a change and rest.
But I hardly thought that in addition
to my other experiences X should add
that of being the captain of a Yukon
River steamboat. But I waa monarch of
all I surveyed on a stern-wheeler, and for
four or five months, too. It came about
in this way:
In our journeyings I had so much trou
ble with pilots that I began to study the
"Ladies and Gentlemen: The next thing
on the programme will be a fiddle solo by
a miner who has worked for me all Â¦win
ter. At least he says he has. He's a
sour dough stiff by the name of Smith.
He wouldn't work much with me, but all
his time was spent tinkering on an old
cigar box that he had rigged up as a
fiddle. He will appear before you and if
he can't play any better than he can mine
I am sorry for the audience. At the same
time it would be a pity to deprive you of
the opportunity of hearing him."
personage important enough to be master
of ceremonies of the affair and when the
time came for my solo he was the one to
announce me. This is the way he did if.
The population there Is about five
eighths American, and I met Captain Jack
Crawford, the poet scout. He was full
of an Elks' benefit performance, a mati
nee, to be given jointly with a Fourth of
July celebration on the next day in the '
new Grand Opera-house just completed.on
the site of the old Palace Grand Theater
In Dawson. I was only in for a few days
from the mines, but he was looking for
assisting talent and he insisted that 1
must heir> them out. I don't know, what
he told concerning me, but that same
afternoon one of the high muck-a-mucks
among the Elks came to me and asked
me to give them a vocal solo. All the
seats were so'd at $29 each and it was
going to be the grandest thing of the
mining season. I told him. which was the
truth, that I could not sing, that I could
play a little, but that I was there just
from work, on business, that I hadn't
brought my wardrobe, which he could see
plainly enough without my telling him.
Finally I yielded and we agreed between Â¦
us that I would play, but that I would
come on the stajre in a garb not my own
and be introduced to the audience as some
one else. We both promised to keep the
secret and then we parted. I spent some
time that evening practicing and arrang
ing: more striking details for my costume.
The next day the hour for the celebra
tion came and with it an audience of
twenty-dollar scaters that overflowed the
new theater. Billy Bard, an old miner,
who owned ten or fifteen claims, was a

I THINK It is natural that all girls
have some idea of what they intend
to be in after life. I have never said
positively what I intend to be, but
now, as I am pinned down to do so,
I shall have to do my best
I have often said I would be a dress
maker or many other things, but as I
grow older I think Â¦ more - of becoming a
teacher. To be a teacher one must have
an excellent education, which takes pa
tience and time. Some girls would get
tired of school, but I don't think that I
will. I have one good advantage, and
that is, I started school young. I am also
very healthy, and I have never been kept
out of school for any reason.
Teachers always have a chance to keep
Improving. They also have short hours,

I would try to make everything as

his other employes. I hope to have a
good thorough course in my two positions.
I would like to be a school teacher,. but
it seems as though I have not patience

The one thing I hope to be more than

I have been able to read reading has been

Of course draping and trimming hats
would be very interesting, but even hats
lose their interest after a while.
I tried the millinery trade and I like it
very much. But to sit in a little room
and sew all day, year after year, would
be an occupation I would not care for.
I am very fond of music, and some day
hot a long way off I hope to take piano
lessons.
I should like to be a school teacher, If
I might teach the little ones, for my best
friends are among the little people. But
I would never have patience with older
pupils, because when they did wrong I
should know they were old enough to
have better sense.
I AM now In the last grade of the Lin

hope is to graduate in June, and, if
possible, without the examination.
That is one of the things I hope for.

MOST girls and boys at goms tfr^t
In their childhood days dream of
the future and build air castles,
which, though very lovely than,
at some time In their life may
fall about their ears and vanish, never to
reappear. I have many, so many desires
that It would take a book to write them all.
Though I love traveling and painting, still
the wish nearest my heart is to help the
poor, the sick and the needy. To be a
nurse or ' philanthropist Is one of my
brightest dreams. 1 Miss Helen Gould Is
my ideal of the latter. Of course I have
not* the fortune to follow in her footsteps,
but I have the health and desire to bÂ« a
good nurse, and tend the sick and dis
tressed. No matter where you go or how
poor you are there can -always be found

Lord, said, f'The poor ye always have with

My choice for being a ship architect
rather than the architect of a house or
other buildings ~ is because the city Is
overrun with the latter, while there are
comparatively few people i who draw the
plans of ships. I think also that' the oc
cupation which I so far have Intended
to take up is a quiet and refined business
for a woman. If I had any talent at all
in drawing or painting I would like to be
an artist, but as the only* drawing I can
do Is mechanical, the occupation of an
architect suits me. If I do take this up
the Lick School will be the best one for
me to go to after my days at the Den
'man are over. However, I will not think
too seriously over this subject as I am
only 12 years old.

of his converts is the Queen . of Servia.
She eschews the soft bed and down Â¦ pil

with a hard, unyielding mattress, and
without the vestige of a pillow under her

method she hopes to preserve the best fig

I j Some one has whispered this in
jy Bella MoncriefTs ear, - and being
â¢** \ devoted to the care of her rose
leaf complexion and the preserva
tion of her beautiful figure, she takes a
twenty-minute rest every afternoon and
her family are told that even if the heav
ens show symptoms of falling her rest
is not to be disturbed.
Let us all follow her good example.
Let us decide that we cannot do every
thing in this life; we must give up some
things. We cannot acquire all the ac
complishments, all the languages, attend
all the receptions, theaters or lectures, sell
tickets for all the benefits, wait on all
the bazars. So we may as well resolve
to take our afternoon rest and "forty
winks" at all events and then do what we
can with the rest of the day. If we get
Thoroughly rested we will be surprised to
Â¦id how much we can accomplish in a
few hours. If we do not rest we will
wonder why we are so languid and why
everything goes wrong and why lines be

It is necessary to be" well covered while

reason: Nature takes the time when one
is lying down to give the heart a rest,
arid that organ consequently makes tec.

an" upright posture, j Multiplying- that by
thirty minutes, * say, it is three hundred
strokes. At- night, when -.about eight
hours are spent In lying down, the heart
is saved nearly five thousand strokes, and
as -the heart pumps six ounces of blood
with: each ; stroke, it lifts .thirty thousand
ounces less of blood s in Â¦ a night * of 'eight
hours spent in bed than when one i3 in an

cles rest and strengthen, and. the beauti
ful arch of the instep is preserved. If it
is impossible to rest the feet in this way,
time failing us, s it Is a real rest and bene
fit to the feet, to change the stockings and
put oh shoes-Tor better still, slippersâ with
an entirely different heel from those of
the shoes taken off, Neither higher or low
er, as the case may.be.
When one can slip off one's garments,
get into a lounging robe and slippers and
let down the hair, the position In which
cne can obtain the best results is natur
ally the recumbent one. But do not lie as
you have always done, with the pillow
uryJer your head. , This Is not the twen
tieth century way. Take the pillows from
under the head and put them under the
feet, because to obtain the best results
from rest and sleep the head must be on a
level or lower than the feet. We have
this message from France, and \t any
woman in the world knows how to pre
serve her beauty and conserve her nerve
force it is the French woman. The physi
cian who is responsible for this theory of
resting declares that if one sleeps in the
the soul," as one exhorts us. - Sleep may
or may not follow. It is not an easy
matter for, a woman who is not accus
tomed to sleep in the daytime to fall in
a. doze at will. Sleep should not exceed
ten or fifteen minutes, this being more reÂ«
freshing than an hour or half -hour's slum
ber. To rest a tired brain place the hands
back of the head, slightly swaying the
head from side to side. Think of nothing;
this is absolutely imperative to attain the
best results from the afternoon rest.
"Worry, which is directly opposed to rest,
is a mortal enemy to beauty and charm
of manner; it is a wrinkle inducer and a
frown instigator; it clouds the eyes, makes
lines about the eyes and mouth and de
stroys repose and gentleness of manner.
What principally distinguishes & Chi
nese woman from an American Is her ut
ter freedom from nervousness. No matter
what â happens, she always remains
phlegmatic, and she can rest or sleep any
where, in any position and in any amount
of â noise. The Chinese woman's face Is
therefore free from wrinkles, even to a
green old age.
When a woman has a few moments for
resting she usually takes up a book or a
bit of sewing. "I think I will sit down
and do this mending and rest. a while."
she says. But she only receives that In
direct help which comes from a change of
occupation. Taking a ten minutes' rest
in a horizontal position, as a change from
standing or sitting at work, will prove
more beneficial to her than any make
shifts at resting. A man is wiser; Inva
riably if he says, "I am going to rest a
while," he does rest, either by lying down
or sitting in one chair with his feet In
another, with hands attest.

Although the- book been written
with the intention of giving to Admiral
Schlc-y an appropriate meed of praise for
the part he played in bringing about the
destruction of the Spanish - fleet, it is
much more than a mere eulogy of his
, abilities. It Is also an exceedingly well
told 6tory of one of the two great naval
battles of the Spanish. war, which have
done so much to enhance. the glory of the
American people in the < eyes of foreign
Mr. Graham devotes a chapter of his
book to Instances of splendid heroism
which he noticed among , the American
seamen while the battle was In progress.
A description of the ships of the Spanish
squadron and of their condition after the
battle Is given, together with brief notices
of some of the principal naval <" officers
among the Spanish. , Two - chapters are
given up -to a quotation of Admiral
Fchley's own account of* the battle of
Santiago. ' . ~
I feel that I ought to devote a chapter to
Schley's personality during battle. * â¢ â¢ He
stood there on the little temporary; footboard
placed for Just this purpose on . the outside of
the conning, tower, the same erect, energetic
figure that years before on ., the lookout box
on the mast of an American cruiser, gazed
across ice fields and ordered â¢ the ship pushed
through them to rescue Hhe starving Greely
and his party from the death that would have
come to them In forty-eight hours but for this
man's indomitable will. . â¢, â¢ â¢ I shall never
forget him during those moments; he was all
life, activity and nerve. He noticed the most
trivial things. Â» â¢ â¢ He was the inspiration
of every man forward. Some small 14-year-old
beys.- apprentices, who were acting as messen
gers, had at first shown signs either of appre
hension or of 'great excitement; but, as the
commodore told them calmly to take messages
and walked coolly around this wooden plat
form with the shells flying close to him and
shrieking over his head and in the deafening
noise of his own ship's {runs, even the young
sters took heart from his example." After de
scribing the battle and vita termination the au
thor continues: "It was then I noticed for
the first time under what a strain this man
had been. His lips were ' cracked and little
flecks of blood showed where the saltpeter
from ; the gun smoke had affected him. His
eyelids , were red from staring through his
glasses 6O continuously, his eyes i were blood-
Ehot and there were dark lines down his . face.
But his hands were steady, his voice was even
though somewhat hoarse from the loud speak
ing which he was compelled to do to be heard
above the- roar of battle,, and it seemed as
though every instant he was thinking of ail
those who had helped him in that day's vic
tory. * -- â¢ - Â¦ Â¦ '
And then, as the smoke blew away a little
more, we saw, following up the Oregon, the
Texas, the poor old "hoodoo of the navy," but
which this day was to disprove her maligners,
and, next to the Brooklyn and the Oregon, do
more than any of the other ships ' to destroy
the Spanish fleet.
Mr. Graham pays a glowing tribute to
the bravery displayed by Schley and all
the other Americans whom he noticed
during the battle., Schley Mr... Graham
considers the ideal -naval commander, a
man in whom are united quickness of
perception, surety of judgment, a fixed
self-reliance and an absolute fearless
ness. During the long strain of watching
for the Spanish ships Mr. Graham says
that Schley displayed the same splendid
qualities which were shown so conspicu
ously during the engagement with the
Spanish fleet. Of Schley's appearance on
that day Mr. Graham says:
Turning on her heel in a short circle moved
the Brooklyn, her port side a perfect mass of
flame and smoke, as the six eight-inch, six
flve-lnch and eight six-pounders belched forth
the deadly shot. Then 'as she swung . toward
the four Spanish ships her â¢ starboard battery
opened and the din was terrific. *. â¢ â¢ , The
Brooklyn had described a perfect clrcl*, and,'
although under a deluge of shot and shell,
practically uninjured, pointed west and began
her famous fight. â¢ â¢ â¢ As , we got fully
around we were pointing to the west, almost
side by side with the Maria Teresa, the Colon
inside of her, the Viscaya just behind the
Spanish flagship and the Oquendo last of all,
starting to burn and evidently In -trouble.
Looking back we saw, instead of what we ex
pected to see, our own ships in fighting array,
simply a heavy pall of smoke, and not an
American ship in view. Schley , turned around
and grimly, said to Captain Cook: "Well,
Cook, we'll have to stay alone with this
crowd." But just then out from the Airtain of
smoke there came a mighty foam-crested wave,
and after it a- flash of immense brilliancy, fol
lowed by the roar which spoke from a thirteen
inch gun. It was the Oregon, and. as our men
and officers saw it they yelled with delight.
Over her low freeboard broke the surging
waters that she pushed aside in her mighty
race, and they dashed up against her great
steel turret, under the mouths of the big thir
teen-inch guns that were hurling death and
defiance at the enemy. She was coming to
help the Brooklyn in her terribly unequal strug
gle with these four great Spanish cruisers,
and every shot that she was firing seemed to
be taking effect.
moving directly toward the Spanish ships com
ing out of the west. Every inclination, had a
decision been made suddenly, was to turn in
the same direction, to the west, to head i them '
off. But had this inclination been followed
the Brooklyn's starboard side would have been
no placed . that any one of the Spanish < fleet
would have been able to ram and sink I her,
with the same fatal result. â¢..â¢ â¢

Here we were In action. . From the time of
Lieutenant Hodgson's announcement .to the
time of the boom of the Brooklyn's guns was
tenant Commander Mason' e strident tones
called, as he himself rushed toward the for
ward deck, "Clear ship for action!" and the
clanging belle notified those below of the sum
mons to battle, while the orderly mass of men.
aNDER the title, "Sehley arid San
tiago," George Edward Graham
has written an account of the
cruise of the flying squadron,
and of the discovery and final
.destruction of the Spanish fleet at San
tiago on July 3, 1S9S. During the . cam
paign against Cervera's fleet Mr. Graham
was an eyewitness of the events of
which he writes. He was on board the
cruiser Brooklyn during the five months
the campaign lasted- Mr. Graham was
the special representative of the Associ
a-ted Press, and had gained permission
from Secretary Long and Commodore
Schley to accompany the squadron. Mr.
Graham was given every opportunity to
observe all that went on from the be
ginning of the cruise until after the bat
tle of Santiago. What he saw Is de
scribed in a graphic way which invests
even well known facts with fresh inter
est. The book is illustrated with a large
number of photographs which were taken
during the cruise and the battle. Ad
miral Schley Indorses the book, as an ac
curate account cf the movements of the
squadron.
A brief history of Schley' s life up to
the time of the Spanish war opens the
book. v
This is followed by a description of the
formation of the flying squadron, and
its search for the Spanish fleet which
was on its way from Spain to Cuba.
The main portion of the book Is devoted
to the movements of the squadron after
it had reached Santiago and had discov
ered there the fleet whose location had
been the cause of so much anxiety to the
Americans. In detail are described the
blockade of the Spanish ships, the bom
bardment of the forts at Santiago, and
the final destruction of the enemy's fleet..
Hobson's splendid achievement in sinking
the Merrimac comes in for a deserved
share of enthusiastic praise.
In the naval battle of July 3 Mr. Gra
ham was 16 an exceptionally good posi
tion for noting all of the most important
events of the battle. The Brooklyn was
at the extreme west of the cordon of
ships which had been drawn about the
outlet of the harbor in which the Span
ish ships lay. When the Spaniards at
tempted to escape they pursued a wester
ly course, which took them past the
Brooklyn. This cruiser, as will be re
membered, was in the thick of the fight
from beginning to end. As Mr. Graham
was in an exposed position on this ship,
from which he could see all that was
transpiring, and as his attention was de
voted wholly to noting the movements of
the two fleets, he is exceptionally well
qualified to tell the story of the battle.
Ail those who love to listen to the tale
of a battle fought with conspicuous brav
ery on both sides will feel many a thrill
in reading Mr. Graham's description of
the naval fight at Santiago. It will be
worth while to quote the account of the
beginning of the fight. The Americans, it
will be remembered, had discovered the
presence of the Spanish ships In San
tiago harbor on the 2Sth of May. From
that day until July 2 the Americans saw
no signs that would lead them to suppose
that the enemy would try to run the
blockade. But on the afternoon of July
â¢1 columns of smoke were seen to rise in
Santiago harbor. The Americans sup
posed this to mean that the enemy were
preparing to move their fleet. A strict
watch was kept of the harbor, but noth
ing happened during the night. It was
upon the quiet of Sunday morning, July
3, that there fell the news of the ap
proach of the enemy's ships. To quote
Mr. Graham:
"After bridge, there! Report to the commo
dore and the captain that the enemy's ships
are coining out." It was the stentorian voice
of Navigator HodgEon calling through the
megaphone from the forward bridge to the
signal officer on the after bridge. There was
no need for the after bridge to repeat it. For
an instant it had turned everybody Into living
etatues. but only for an instant. Then Oeu-

" 'My name's Benjamin Glegg.' responds
old Glegg. 'I owns the Sunflower brand

4 Then Enright makes old Glegrg a long,
soft talk, an' seeks to imboo him with
ca'mness. He relates how Abby an' the

counsels old Glegg not to go pestcrin' in
with roode objections to the weddin'. â¢
" 4 Which I says this as your friend,' re

Good Book says: A soft answer turneth
away wrath. More speshully when the
opp'sition's got yonr guns. I begin to see
things different. Still. I hates to lose my
Abby that a-way. Since my old woman
dies, Abby, gents, has been the world an'
all to me.*
" Is your wife dead?* asks Enright, like
he sympathizes.
" 'Shore!* says old Glegg. 'Been out an'
gone these two years. She's with them
cherublm'ln glory. But folks, you oughter
seen her to onderstand my loss. Five
years ago we has a ranch over back of
the Tres Hermanas by the Mexico line.
The Injuns used to go lopin' by our ranch,
no'th an' south, all the time. You-all re-
calls when they pays twenty-five dollars
for skelps in Tucson? My wife's that
thrifty them days, she buys all her own
an' my child Abby's clothes with the In

for her maw. "Yere comes another!" lit
tle Abby would cry, as she stampedes up
all breathless. With that, my wife would
take her hands outen the washtnb, snag
onto that savage with her little old Win
chester, and quit winner twenty-flve dol
lars right thar.'
" Which I don't marvel you-all mourns
her loss,' says Enright consolin'ly.
" She's shorelyâ Missis Glegg isâ' says
old Glegg. shaking his grizzly head; 'she's
shore the most meteoric married lady of
which hlst'ry says a word. My girl
Abby's. like her.*
" 'But whatever's your objection,*
irgues Enright, 'to this young an* trusty
>:port who's so eageÂ» to wed Abby?'
" 'I objects to him because he gambles,'
says old Glegg. 'I can tell he gambles by
him pickin* up the salt cellar between his
thumb an' middle finger, with the fore
finger over the top, like it's a stack ot
chips one even* when he stays to supper
an* I asks him to "pass the salt." Then
ag'in, he don't drink; he tells me so him
se'f one time when I invites him to libate.
I ain't goin' to have no teetotal son-in

way; I'd feel criticized an* 1 couldn't
stand it, gents. Â¦ Lastly, I don't like this
yere felon's name none.'
" 'Whatever is his name, then?' asks
Enright. 'So far, he don't confide no title
to US'.'
" 'Which I don't wonder none,!' says Old
Glegg. 'It shows he's decent enough to
be ashamed. Thar's hopes of him yet.
Gents, his 1 name's Toad Allen. "Allen"
goes, but, gents, I bars "Toad."', Do you
all blame me? I asks you, as onbiased
sports, would you set ca'mly down while
a party named "Toad" puts himse'f In
nom'nation to "be your son-in-law?'
" 4 None whatever!' says Jack Itoore;
an' Dan an' Cherokee an' Texas echoes
the remark.
" camp down yere with a tum
bler of Valley Tan,' says Enright, 'an'
make yourse'f comfortable with my col
leagues, while I goes an' confers with
our Gretna Green outfit in the r'ar
room.'
"Enright returns after a bit, an' his
face has that air of se'f-satisfaction that
goes with a gent who's playin' on vel
vet. ' r
44 'Tour comin* son-in-law,* says Enright
to old Glegg, 'defends himse'f from them
charges as follows: He agrees to quit
gamblln'; he says he lies a whole lot when
he tells you-all he don't drink none; an"
lastly, 'deplorin' "Toad" as a cognomen,
an' explainin' that he don't assoome it of
choice, but sort o r has it forced on him In
his he'pless infancy, he offersâ you con-'
sentin' to the weddln'â to reorganize his
play onder the name of "feenjamin Glegg
Allen."
"Son, this" yere last proposal nacherally
wins over old Glegg in a body. He not
only withdraws all objections to them
nuptials, but allows he'll make the piq
feather Â¦ sport an" Abby full partners In
the Sunflower brand. At this p'int, En
right notifies the preacher sharp that all
depends on him; an' that excellent gent
at once acquits hlmse'f so that in two
minutes Wolfville adds another success
ful weddin' to Its list of triumphs.
. â¢â¢ 'It 'Iustrates, , too,' says Enright,
when two days later that weddln' party
has returned to Tucson, an' Wolfville
ag'in sinks to its normal state of slum
brous ease, "it sort o*. , 'lustratea how

face, an' & greyhoun*. In the waist,' says
Missis Rucker; an* I ain't got any mortal ;
use for no sech splndlln' trollops as this

" "I don't know,' says Enright, shakin'
his head; 'I ain't grot much practical ex
perience with women to guide by; but I
reckons now it's love that does it. Who
ever is that gent, Peets, who says "Love
is blind?" He knows his business, that,

" M ain't none so shore neither," says
Peets. 'Love may be blind, but somehow,
I don't sign up the play that way. Thar's
plenty of people, same as this pinfeather

later. On the weddin'.'day Wolfvllle's too
busy trackin' 'round an' "backiri*
Abby's an' the pinfeather party's
game to go makin' remarks. In
this yere connection, however, it's
only jestice to Abby to say that her
pinfeather beau don't share Missis Rttck-'
er's views. Although Abby done threat- .
eiis him with a gun-play to make him
lead her to the altar that time her old
paw creases him, an' he begins to wax
iow-sperited about wedlockâ like he re
lates to Enright ' formerâ still, the pin
ftather party's enamored a Abby an* ,
plump wropped up In her.
" 'Shore!' says this pinfeather party to
Texas Thompson, who, outen pure sym
pathy for him, takes the bridegroom over
to the Red Light to be refreshed. 'Shore!
While thar's no one that egreegrious to
go elaimln' that my Abby's doo to grade
'as "cornfed," all the same she's one of
the most fascinatin' ladiesâ that V is. an'
give her a gunâ in all the len'th an*,
breadth cf Arizona. I know; for I've
seen my AbLy shoot.'
" 'Excoose me, pard,' says Texas, aftt-r
surveyin' the pinfeather party plenty
sympathetic; 'pardon my seemin' rood
ness, if I confers with barkecp aside. On
the level! Now,' gees on Texas to Black
Jack as he pulls him off to a corner an'
whispers bo the pinfeather party don't
hear, 'on the level. Jack! Ain't It my
dooty-me who saveys" what he's ag'inscâ .
to go warn: this yere victim touchin* of
matrimony in all its horrors?'
"'Don't you do it!' remonstrates Black
Jack, an' his voice trembles with the
emphasis he feel*; 'don't you do it none!
~ou-all stand paws off! Which you don't
know when you'll be answerable for! If â¢ '
this yere marriage gets broke off, who
knows what new line of conduct this
Abby maiden will put out. She may rope
onto Boggs Or Peets or mebby even you.
As long as Abby ain't marryln' none of
us. Wolfville's attitoode oughter be one
of dignified reserve.'
"Texas sighs deep an* sad as he turns
a' gin to the pinfeather party; but he sees
the force of Black Jack's argyments an'
yields without an effort to combat 'em.
" 'After all,' says Texas to * himse'f,
'others has suffered; wherefore then
should this yere jaybird gent escape?' An'
with that Texas hardens his heart a
whole lot an* gives up any notion of this
pinfeather person's rescoo.
"Which" Abby now issues forth of the
O. K. restauraw an' j'ines the pinfeather
party when he emerges from the Red
Light
" 'This yere sky pilot,' says Dan Bogg<
approachin' the happy couple, 'sends
word by me that he's over in the Noo
York store. In default of a shore enough
sanchooary, he allows he yootilizes that
hive of trade as a headquarters; an' ht's
now waltin', all framed up an' ready to
turn for you-alL Likewise, he's been
complainin' some querulous that"*
you folks is harsh with him, an' abducts
him an' threatens his skelp.'
" 'Now. see thar!' ejae'lates Abby
liftin' up her hands. 'Does mortal years
ever before listen to sech folly! I suppose
he takes that gun I has as threats! I'm
a onprotected young female, an' nacher
ally, when I embarks on this yere elope-'
ment, I packs one of paw's guns. Besides,
this sweetheart of mine might get cold
feet an' try to jump the game, an' then
I'd need said weepon some to make good
my p'aition. But it's neter meant for that
pastor! When I'm talkin' to him, to pre
vail on him to come along, an' that gun in
my hand at the time, I does sort o' make
references to him with the muzzle. . But
he needn't gro gettin' birdheaded an' timid
over it; thar's shore nothin' hostile

"'Enright explains to him satisfactory,'
says Boggs. 'An 1 as you urges It don'V
mean nothin'. Folks ou the brink of bein'
married that a-way gets so exyooberat
it comes mighty near the same as bem'
locoed.'
" 'Well,' says the pinfeather party,
who's been stackln' up a dust-cloud where
some one's gallopin* along about three
miles over the trail toward Tucson, 'if
I'm any dab at a guess, that's your in
furiated paw pirootin' along over yonder,

FOUR days after that pinfeather

with a look of sage reflection,
"four days after that Dinfeather

to make use of Wolfville as a private,

is held in a sort o' captivity that a-way.
What nacherally bolsters up this yere
theory !s that the maiden's got a six

I'm shore that gent.'
" "Which if thar's a wearied hectored

to a hoss-hustler, 'you-a.ll can come

"The preacher sharp, who's about as

to the pinfeather party, 'that pendin' hos

Missis Rucker's? Thar she gets tombs
an' breshes, an' goes over her make-up
some an' straightens out her game.'
"The pinfeather party allows this yero
is a excellent notion, only him an' Abby
don't seem cl'ar as to what oughter b.Â»
done about the preacher sharp.
" 'You see, he don't want to come,' ex
plains the pinfeather party, 'an' it's cost
me an'" Abby a heap of trouble to round
him up. I ain't none shore but he seizes
on the first chance to go stampedin'; an*
without him, nacherally, these rites we
all is bankin' on would bog down a whole
lot.'
" 'No, friends," says the preacher sharp;
'I will promise to abide by you an' em
brace no openln* to escape. Since I'm
heie, I will yoonite you-all as you wish;
the more readily because I trusts that as
man an' wife, you'll prove a mootual re
straint one upon the ether; an' also for
that I deems you both in your single
footed capac'ty as a menace to the'eom
moonity. Fear not. prepare yourse'fs, an'
I'll bring you together in the happy
bonds of matrimony at the drop of thÂ«
hat.'
" -you notes. Dan/ says Texas Thomp
son, who's off to one side with Dan Boggs,
'you notes he says that, like his heart's
resentful. Them culprits has r'iled him
up some; an* now he allows that the short
cut to play even is to marry 'em as they
demands. â¢ Which If you-all knows that
former wife of mine who gets divorced,
Dan, you appreciate what I says.'
"Even after the preacher sharp gives
his p'role, Abby acts plenty doobious. She
ain't shore she's wise to throw him loose.
It's Doc PeetB who reasshores her.
" 'My dear young lady.' says Peets, at
the same time bowin' to the ground, 'you
may trust this maverick to me. I'll pledge
my word to prodooce him at the croocial
moment when he's called for to make
these nuptials win.'
" "Which I'm a heap obleeged to you.
Mister,' eays Abby to Peets, sizin* him up
approvin'; 'and now that I'm convinced
thar's no chance of my footure sufferin'
from any absenteeism on the part of this

this bluff, an' sort p' confldin' the
preacher sharp to Pects, Abby goes curv

m take chances an' lie a lot to say that
any lady's beautiful that a-way, if you-all

blizzard effect to her face, an' the* best
you can say is that if she don't look love

gnurliest pine knot burns frequent the

titled "Comrades of the Klondike," the
first stanza of which is as follows:

Is the story of .the ' mutineers . of the j

treachery, drunkenness, murder and mad
ness, of virtue, soberness, -piety and hap

The story tells how a score or more of
lawless men of the Bounty set adrift in
an open boat the commander and part of
. his crew, returning, themselves to Tahiti,
.whence the ship had sailed/ with a cargo
of young breadfruit trees- consigned to the

, For twenty-two years Pitcairn has been
home to - Philip Coffin. Before that his
home was on the sea. Ha was born to a
sailor's heritage. He was a ;Nantucket_
man, though chance gave him Boston
birth; : and in Nantucket the prayer of
every mother and the wish of every
father, la' that : their sons may so to aea
and become captain of a ship.
: At. the age of 12 Philip made his first
voyage with his father, who was mate on
a merchantman bound"for New Orleans.
"My -mother "thought it - would give me
a chance to sow my wild oats," says old
/man Coffin, "and that I'd - go .back and .
stay, at school. But it only gave me a
taste for roving. At 14 I went to sea In
earnest on a whaler, and for thirty years
I followed the sea, now on whaling ships,
now on merchantmen, sometimes as sailor
and again as mate." â¢
< To the Indian' Ocean whaling and back
again; . around the Horn; on a merchant
vessel to far-off. San Francisco and back :
once, twice and again; tired of life on a
merchantman and off on a whaling cruise

follow the course of a sailor's life.

Philip Coffin, \A/ho Considers Himself Shipwrecked, Though He Lli/es In the Heart of Civilization
From the hold of the Silberhorn Philip
Coffin has carried that part of the cargo
so precious to him, so worthless to any
other. In a. little back room of a sailors'
saloon on the vrater front his goods are
huddled, while day after day Philip Cof
fin wanders about the docks, hoping some
ship that sails will give him passage to.
Pitcairn or even Tahiti. Could he but
reach Tahiti -lie is sure some passing
schooner would take him the rest of the
way.
And why. you may ask, came this old
man so far from his home?
The pitiful pile in the little back room
of the sailors' saloon is the answer.
Three years ago Philip Coffin learned
that the United States Government was
paying bounty due those who served in
the navy during the Civil "War. He had
Â¦ served for two years and knew he could
claim a share of the bounty.
There was a time when money would
have been no Inducement for any mem
ber of that simple colony of Pitcairn. folk
to venture away from the Island. They
use no money among themselves and un
til recent years were content with such
cheap, modest stores as could be found
on ships that chance brought to their
Island. l>s - â¢
More frequent contact with people from
the outside world has lessened In some
degree their old-time simplicity; â¢*>* when

the power of money, heard that tor the

.^aii's love is confident; woman's pro-
Perhaps in the wife'* heart was a vague
iear that once away from Pitcairn other
tics might claim and -wean him from her.
iluch stories have come to the ears of
Pitcairn women; stories of men who visit
neighboring islands, marry native women*
and, tiring of them, sail away to homes
they have left in other lands. Women
are women the . world over, and no
woman's heart is proof against Invasion
of the green-eyed serpent.
While bis wife begged and* he almost
yielded, his friends piqued his pride by
K their good-natured jibes.
For a week he lived in a stupor, unable
to work, scarce able to eat. The captain
vsjs kind to him. and his shipmates, too,
ard there was nothing to do but stay with
the Fhip. It took him to Ireland, where
the cargo* was discharged, then on to Liv
erpool. He had no money to pay duty on
his goods and must calmly wait till the
Silberhorn sailed .again.
Two weeks ago he found himself once
more in San Francisco, having passed and
repassed his "home, as be traveled half
rour.d the world and back again to the
starting point.
Far into the nipht he stayed at the rail,
"here hiÂ« hope had died, as the Silber-*
hrrn drove through the waves, carrying
him farther and .farther away.
*T^f MAN from Pitcairn Island ma
/_\ rooned in San Francisco!
I I The irony of it, and the pity of
1 it. too.
This is the cruel trick a freak
â¢*>! fate has served Philip Coffln. . an
American whose, home for ' more than
twenty years has been the most inacces
sible island in the Pacific.
For three long years PhliÂ«iÂ» Coffln has
ix-en stranded in San Francisco. For
thrre long years he has longed for Plt
< surn and a sight of the face of one
vi-'iom he loves as though it were yester
dayânot twenty-one years ago â he made
her his bride.
Out of the harbor of San Francisco
Khips are sailing every day of the year,
sailing to every qvarter of the wind; but
in these three weary, lonesome years
there has been no ship to carry a penni
less, heart-hungry old man back to his
is'and home.
Once a good ship's captain tried and
failed. That was a year ago. On the
British merchantman Silherhorn Philip
Â«'.offin was taken as sailmaker, with a
promise that if it could be done the ship
would call at Pitcairn.
With eager heart and willing hands
Philip Coffin worked as the Silberhorn
carried him nearer and nearer his home.
He counted the hours, the minutes, that
kept h'm from wife and family. As he
counted he prayed for a wind that wonld
drive the ship into the tiny harbor of
P;tca.:rn Island.
With fair weather Pitcairn is some
thirty days from San Francisco. They
paseed at last and the day dawned that
ho had hoped would see him home. But
Pitcairn was not sighted. The wind
v.riuld not answer; the Silberhorn must
sail on. She had fetched to leeward of
the Island, as sailors say. and might
have to beat about for days before she
could make the harbor.
And Philip Coffin? All day he stood
at the rail of the ship, straining his eyes
for a glimpse of the cliffs of the tiny
is!e. In every cloud that skimmed the
horizon he thought he defined her out
line. His fancy saw, though his eyes
could not, the form of his fair-haired
wife and the little ones grouped around
her. He felt the clasp of their arms
fÂ»bcut his neck and their whisper of love
in li's <?arÂ«. He thought of the joy he
had planned to give, for down in the hold
of the ship were bundles and bales and
boxes, all bulging %rith gifts he had
housht.
These were the dreams that had come
to him softly at night as he neared his
home. And dreamed them now in the
elare of the noonday sun as he clung to
the rail, hi;* eyes blinded by tears, his
threat aching with sobs that he tried to
< hrck.
Adventures there were in plenty of the
sort that all seadogs tell. One that stands
out^irom the other3 is of the whaling
days In the Indian Ocean.
"We were out one day in the small
boat," said the old man. losing for a
moment the pain of the present In the
thrilling thought of the past. "...
"We had harpooned our whale and were
waiting for the old fellow to wear him
self out as he rushed through the water
dragging the boat away from the ship.
"Suddenly the great hulk disappeared.'
The boat rocked on the waves, the line
grew slack and the next we knew our
boat was high In air and we -were splaslv
ing about in the water. Dowrr, went the
whale out of sight and up again, catch-
Ing the boat amidships In his jaws. Then
he sank from sight. We scrambled on
top of what was left of the boat land
clung there until picked up by another
boat late in the night."
Rightly enough, it was a shipwreck that
changed the current of Philip Coffin's later
life.
His romance had begun a half dozen
years before at Pitcairn.
Philip Coffln had sailed the world
around, had seen women of many lands
no doubt had loved them, too, in sailor
fashionâ here for a day and away. But
he forgot them all when he landed one
day on Pitcairn Island and saw the grand
daughter of the Governor.
This is the picture he still carries In his
heart: A barefoot girl, with* fair hair
braided and coiled close, cheeks tinted by
sun and wind in health's own colors and
big gray eyes with innocent laughter In
them. She was a child of 9. he a man of
20, but he loved her, and, though asked
no promise of her, he made up his mind
that some Bay he would come back and
claim her for his bride.
And he did not forget. No letters pass
ed between them, for Pitcairn was even
more cut off from the world then than
now; but in his sailor dreams there was
ever a figure with golden braids and big
gray eyes, and in his heart there was
ever a purpose to go back some day and
win her. 'â¢!,' '
After that voyage and others that fol
lowed Philip Coffln stopped for a while In
San Francisco. He worked in the quar
ries on Angel Island when the rock was
taken out for the City Hall. But not for
long could he withstand the lure of the
sea. . :-. /. ';'[;
One day an English trader, the Arcadia,
lay In port, and when she shipped her
crew Philip Coffinjs name was on the list.
She was boundâ no matter where. Miss
ing her course, she went ashore on a
coral reef. With a hole in her side the
crew abandoned her, taking to the small
.boats.- '.-''Â¦ ' â¢
By means of sails they made and good,
strong hands at the oar, a week in the
open boats landed them safe and sound
on Pitcairn Island." V
Chance had favored Philip Coffln, and
in aix months he was married to the girl
of his dreams. , -
Together they buil$ a rude hut of rough
boards, roofed with palm leaves; together
they planted the little plat of ground al
lotted them. In Pitcairn men and women
work side by side.
Thus Philip Coffln, the world-rover, be
came a quiet, stay-at-home farmer In thn
most out-of-the-way spot on the map. And
In the simple life he found happiness.
Time has been gentle with the old man,
and his . sixty-five years have . not taken
the light from his eyes nor robbed his
cheeks of color; and his step has not lost
Its spring. Time deals thus with all In
Pitcairn, they say, and few die young.
But the worry and disappointment of
the past year have left their mark upon
him. Not only has there been the loner
ing for home and loved ones, but also tbÂ«
cruel thought that they may think him
untrue to them.
That the wife he has never ceased to
love should have, 'cause to doubt him Is
almost too much to endure. He has writ
ten many letters, but for more than a year
no word has come to him, and he can
not know that his letters have bÂ«en re
ceived.
Once, long aso, Mr. Coffln had 'a letter
from his youngest daughter. "Dear papa,"
it read, "If we do not see you again in
this world we will surely meet in heaven."
"It was ambition and pride that mads
me come," says this unhappy exile. "I
wanted to get the money and buy gome
nice things for my family and friends. Z
thought, too, I'd go back and seÂ« my
mother's crave.
"Sorry? Before I was out of sight of
the island I regretted It All I aak U to
get home again, and I'll leave the Island
no more. I'll drop both my anchors, pay
out all my chain and stay there like a
Government lightship." . -~ ;

reason to believe, however, that the Em
bassador communicated to Secretary Hay
the declaration made/at St. Petersburg,*
showing that Russia looks with equanim
ity upon the Anglo-Japanese treaty, be
cause It ' supports the principles which
she has advocatedâ the Independence and

More Anxious to 'Please America
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.â Russia has In
timated to the United States that shÂ© re
grets Its , action in protesting against tha
Russo-Chinese Bank convention, which Is
on the point of signature In Peking.
This Intimation has been made through
Embassador Tower, accredited to the St.
Petersburg Government It was reported
this afternoon that as the result of tha
American protest, the Russo-Cblnesa
Bank arrangement would be modified, bfat
the department has received no advices
to this effect. It would not surprise well
informed officials, however, should Rus
sia make concessions to show her friend
ship for this country. It is stated em
phatically that If such concessions are
granted they will not be given because of
the threat contained in the Anglo-Japan
ese treaty? That , treaty would on tha
other hand tend to cause Russia to adopt
a policy of Indifference to the claims of
foreign powers.
It Is not likely that the United States v
will make any further representations to
Russia regarding the Russo-Chinese Ban*
arrangement. Secretary Hay has an
nounced the position of this Government,
and he sees no necessity for making fur
ther representations.
Though that announcement was made a
few days before the publication of tha
Anglo-Japanese convention, it Is stated
that the United States acted independent
ly .-- Secretary Hay, in fact, took the lead
in' making representations .regarding the
Than England and Japan.

NEW YORK. Feb. IS.â "England's float
at Manila stood ready to take sides with
Dewey and to open fireâ to begin warâ on

to that effect was served on the German
admiral, and as an earnest of what the
notice meant British ships were moved
into, position between the German and
American fleets so they might be in place
to give efficient aid to the United States
if necessary. We were ready to clear
deck3 for action."
These are the words of Sir Edward
Chichester, commander of England's fleet
at Manila, as reported by an American
official of prominence, who heard thÂ©
British naval officer speak themâ and
many more of the same import.*

the English barges one day were filled
with coal and the next day had but little.
One night: the American ships were re

British commander, Â¦ according to Tha
Call's Informant.
"It seems noteworthy," said this Ameri
can to-dayT "that Sir Edward Chichester
was only a captain when he was at Ma

be an admiral of the British navy. This
promotion is made at a time when tha

Prince Henry of Prussia has but freshly
apologized to Admiral Dewey for tha ac

He further told them that unless the
leaders showed some disposition for im
mediate action he would send to Con
gress a special message calling attention
to the Immediate necessity of the case
and urging speedy legislation. He Im
pressed upon them again the obligations
of the country and suffering and desti
tution that might result from further de
lay.
The Senators and Representatives who
participated in the conference were Quite
as frank as the President himself, and
told him that, while concession to Cuba
In some practical form was almost sure
to. come, the matter could not be hast
ened so long as the high protectionists of
the House were of the present frame of
mind.
OPPOSES FURTHER DELAY.
While the President listened to all this
with attention and appreciated the diffi
culties in the legislative branch, he could
not see any good reason for further de
lay after the passage of the war tax re
peal bill, and still again insisted upon
immediate action.
On coming from the conference the
Senate and House leaders observed the
greatest reticence as to what had taken
place, and declared that any statement
of the proceedings must come from the
President. They admitted, however, that
there was a general discussion of busi
ness to be considered by the present Con
gress, and added that -It Is the 'intention
of the leaders to, so frame the order of
business as to be able to clear up all of
the general appropriation bills and dis

by June 1st.

In their programme is Included consid

Ben Hamilton lost his life in a snowslide
last Wednesday. Hamilton was caught
In an avalanche of .snow about a mile
wide. His body has not been recovered.
It is probable that -the county authori

the guilty to justice, and in this connec
tion there is some doubt as to. the value
of the statement made by Nina Futreil
for the reason that it was neither sworn
to nor taken down in the presence of any
one vested with authority. < Thus there
may be trouble in store for the local phy
sicians, who. while they apparently acted
from humanitarian motives, rest under
the of having attempted to
shield the man accused in the statement.
It was shown by the testimony of sev
eral witnesses that Miss Futrell several
days ago applied to two physicians of this
city for medical relief. Before they would
consent to treat the woman they were
.given a written statement by her, signed
by two witnesses, to the effect that the
operation was performed by a Traver
physician and that her condition, had be
come such' that medical relief was neces
sary. In the statement the unfortunate
woman exonerated the local doctors from
all blame. , â¢.
VISALIA, Feb. 15.â Nina Futrell, a
woman of questionable character, died in
this, city yesterday under circumstances
so suspicious that Coroner T. C. Caruth
ers deemed ah investigatioif necessary. An
inquest was. held and the verdict of the
jury augurs ill for a Traver physician
and may, cause two local doctors much
trouble. It was found that the woman's
death was due to a criminal operation;
and the Coroner's jury urged the county
officials to Immediately proceed against
the guilty person or persons.

appearance and endeavored to drag the
passenger from the train, but wuhout

door. The train was again stopped and
another fruitless attempt was made to
find the robber, who was not again seen

LONDON, Feb. 15.â The dispute over the
attitude of. the powers toward the United
States prior to the Spanish-American war
continues to take up columns of the Lon
don dallies. Opinion Is much divided as
to the wisdom of Lord Cranborne's course
In making his first statement on the sub

the later developments the opposition to
further disclosures by the.British Govern

mined protest against the revealment of
secret documents relating to the negotia

over the question as to who shall' insinuate
himself in her favor, but as to who shall prove
having been ever her true, great and only
friend. Dr. von Holleben' a dlspatoh totally
upsets the English stories and, according to
Lord Cranborne's statement, England Is taking
refuge in a disavowal of the personal initiative
of Its Embassador. It is a pitiful spectacle.
The Temps thinks Great Britain is get

The English press will admit that the British
Government has undertaken . a 'Â¦ â¢ campaign of
slander in order to make England popular in

leben's dispatch Is correct, the responsibility
for the "conspiracy" against tjie United States
falls on Lord Pauncef ot,' and In this case the
campaign started by England was not only
clumsy and Impotent but slanderous. Lord
Cranborne's reply yesterday seems almost a dis
avowal of Lord Pauncef ote. â¢ .;....

ROME, Feb. 13.â ThÂ© Pope has cabled
to President Roosevelt expressing hope
for the speedy recovery of the latter*s
son. ' â¢ ."' '
GROTON, -Mass.. Feb. 15.â The latest
reports from the rooms of the three sick
students are favorable. Mrs.* Roosevelt
stated this afternoon that her son was
doing splendidly and that they were all
extremely gratified with his improvement.
The Potter and Gammell lads are also
gaining, although their convalescence is
not so rapid as in young Roosevelt's case.
Should no new complications arise, it
is Mrs. Roosevelt's belief that she will
be able to take her son to Washington
some time next week. Miss Alice Roose
velt arrived at Groton this afternoon, ac
companied by the steward of the White
House; She was driven to the infirmary
of the school, . where she met her mother
and Teddy. /â¢ Â¦ '
Mother and sister remained by the sick
boy's bedside during nearly the entire
afternoon and evening, leaving shortly
before 9 o'clock for the residence of Dr.
Gardner, their home while in Qroton.
There is every reason to believe the pa
tient will pass a comfortable night.
A medical review of young Roosevelt's
case shows that the boy became ill as
the result of cooling off suddenly after
violent exercise. The first diagnosis
showed acute lobar pneumonia on both
lungs, the left lung being the most
seriously involved. The left lung soon be
came entirely affected and the right con
gested. It was a typical case of double
pneumonia.
Dr. Lambert, upon his arrival last Mon
day, found the lad seriously 111 with
pulse 120 and temperature 105 and the
case had become complicated with acute
pleuritls. The administration of oxygen
was deemed necessary. This greatly re
lieved the patient. The second stage of
the disease found the heart ineffective,
but oxygen and powerful stimulants had
the desired effect, and on Tuesday tHe
temperature dropped. On Wednesday the
oxygen was discontinued. The third stage
was entered with the vitality of the pa
tient not greatly impaired. The heart
gained in strength and the improvement
was very steady.

BERLIN, Feb. 15.â After Lord Cran
borne's repeated statements on the | sub
ject in the British House of. Commons, it
is generally recognized here In the press
that the > British Government was not
privy to Lord Pauncef ote's action' of April
14, -1898.. German Government circles are
now willing to concede this, though em
phasizing the Impossibility of Germany
knowing that Lord Pauncef ote acted
without instructions - from his Govern
ment, it being against all diplomatic pre
cedents for. an Embassador to - make so
Important a proposition without instruc
tions. The explanation that Lord Paunce
fote acted in behalf of Dr. Hegel Mueller,
the Austrian Minister, while not' rejected
absolutely is not regarded as exposing Dr.
von Holleben to blame for a misconcep
tion, since Lord Pauncef ote gave no inti
mation in the conference that he was sub
mitting another speech on the proposition,
and the impression made on the Embas
sadors uniformly was that It was submit
ted on Lord Pauncef ote's initiative.- Ho w
Â¦ ever, there Is no disposition here to keep
the controversy! alive,, since, it Is proved
that Germany , took no * unfriendly. . step
against the United States. :;
\i Surprise Is expressed at -the" fact that
some of the English newspapers affect to
believe that the Reichsanzeiger .Â¦ publica
tion . of the Von I Holleben I correspondence*
occurred without the Emperor's approval,
whereas everybody familiar with German
press matters. must know that the publi
cation of such documents in the organ re
quires his Majesty's express orders. Much
satisfaction Â¦ is expressed here at the fact
that the American press now recognizes
Germany's ; friendly attitude at a critical
moment. : , .
Bismarckian Action Again.
We view the squabble with considerable
amusement, but have no intention of putting
in an oar. Should we say all we know our re
lations with | several of the European powers,
which are now quite satisfaot- â â¢ might be se
riously Impaired. Moreover, we are not in the
habit of breaking: the- hard and fast laws of
diplomatic secrecy. We are naturally pleased,
however, that the affair has brought Â¦ out tha
fact that we practically gave in to all the con
ditions demanded by the United Stafcs and that
our submission, on which the Ambassadors de
liberated April 14, 1898, was suppressed.
Among the diplomats in London the con
troversy is generally regarded as offset
ting the benefits which had been private
ly termed "England's coup in China."
An influential member qC the Spanish dip
lomatic service, who is now here, said:
What the Saturday Review now terms
Lord Cranborne's "indiscretion" would
doubtless have brought upon the Govern
ment severe criticism had not the Anglo-
Japanese treaty diverted public attention
and had not ' the alliance been generally
regarded as a great stroke of diplomacy.'
As it is, the dispute has served to strain
to a really serious point the relations be
tween Great Britain and Germany, which
were none too harmonious prior to* the
first question on the subject asked by
Henry Norman in the House of Com
mons. â¢â¢Â¦ % â¢
After Dewey's victory Lord Salisbury
took the almost unprecedented step of
communicating .with the editors 'of- the
leading Conservative dallies, urging them
to desist from criticism of the United
States, pointing out how vital It was to
Great Britain's interest that the side of
the United States and not that of Spain
should be advocated in the English press.
As a result public opinion was reversed
and the Government was thoroughly sup

Among the Americans resident in Lon
don during the month of May, 1898, it is
recalled, however, that an intense pro-
Spanish feeling existed on many sides,
especially in society, where women con
nected with Government officials appeared
wearing the Spanish j colors. In this and
many other ways London became at that
period none too comfortable a dwelling
place for Americans, for the press teemed
with anti-American editorials. The ces
sation of the latter was due to a remark
able occurrence." â¢ :

The burgomaster, who is president of
the arbitration tribunal, announced that
It had been decided to comply with the
demands of the striking stokers.
The Government has applied a special
regime to the Trieste district and has
suspended the ordinary civil rights. The
announcement that it had been decided, to
concede the demands of the strikers had
a tranquillizing effect this evening. The
total number of persons killed Is six and
a score were injured.
Three of the rioters were killed and
four wounded. The street lamps have
been broken off and the gas has been Ig
nited. The police and troops are pelted
from the house tops with tiles and slate.
A number of those who were wounded
â¢when the troops on the Plaza Grande
fired a volley Into a mob yesterday have
since died.
Many black flags were flying thTS after
noon and mobs paraded the streets,
smashing the windows of those who did
not display mourning. The result was
that there were repeated encounters be
tween the rioters, soldiers and police and
many arrests were made.
One detachment of troops which was
attacked retaliated by firing on the mob.
TRIESTE. Austria, Feb. 15.â Crowds
thronged the streets this morning, but
military patrols keep the strikers and
public generally moving. All the squares
and public buildings are occupied by sol
diers and large contingents of the mili
tary forces are in readiness for immedi
ate action. Business is suspended.
The Agrarians, In discussing the amend
ment, showed their usual antl- American
animus. Count von Kanltz, the Agrarian
leader, again argued that the United
States could not afford a tariff war with
Germany, saying it would be "downright
suicide," owing to the heavy excess of
American exports to Germany. The Vos
sische Zeitung answers this assertion by
showing that the immense German Im
ports of raw material from the United
States are not necessary.
The trial of officers of the Trebor-
Trocknung (grain buying) 'Company of
Cassel caused a very great sensation. The
newspapers filled many columns with de
tails of the trial, which , brought out the
history of the company's meteoric career,
showing it to have been " a gigantic
swindle from - the beginning, though Di
rector Schmidt succeeded in deceiving the
board of overseers until the crash came.
They regarded him as a financial genius
and trusted him completely while distrib
uting 50 per cent dividends from fictitious
proiits, practicing: wholesale operations in'
financial bills, hoodwinking the Lelpzei
ger Bank and his own overseers and mak
ing Unmense advances. The evidence In
dicated that the company never earned
an honest dividend and it was a humbug
throughout.
The amendment adopted yesterday fix
ing January 1, 1905, for definitely putting
the new tariff law in force is a step of
the Agrarians and is Intensely embarrass
ing for the Government, since it Is not
certain when the treaty negotiations can
be concluded, and"' the amendment Is
plainly designed to compel the Govern
ment to Invite tariff wars through denun
ciation of the present treaties before new
ones are concluded.
BERLIN, Feb. 15.â The prospects of the
tariff bill grow more dismal. The major
ity of the committee continues to vote
amendments against the warnings of the
Government. The amendment providing
for the abolition of the municipal
octroi duties, still in vogue in some towns,
received \ an overwhelming Â¦ majority j of
votes after the . Imperial Secretary of
State for the Interior, Count von Posa
dowsky-Wehner, had announced that It
was contrary to the constitution and that
constitutional revision was necessary be
fore the abolition of those duties could be
effected.

DR. KILMER & CO., Blnghamton, N. T. "* '
â¢ About two years ago I had a very severe case of kidney and bladder trouble*.
The pain in the small of my back was so severe that I could not stand it to stay In
one position more than a moment or two, and was obliged to pass water very
often day and night. I tried medicines and doctors without getting relief. Noticing
an advertisement In the Topeka State, Journal of Swamp-Root, ,1 determined to
- give it a trial, and bought a bottle. By the time I had finished the first bottle the
'' pain had entirely disappeared from my back. The pain and frequent desire to
pass water ceased. However, I continued to take the medicine, using about six
bottles in all. That was over a year ago, and I have had no return of the trouble

I. H. Cammack, acting principal of tho

power to obtain for the unfortunates such
immediate relief as can be got from citi
zens of Los Angeles. The result is that
the missionaries will return with a wagon
load of provisions and clothing and some
money, but these will be wholly inade
quate to the needs of the Indians. . An
effort will be made to arouse more inter
est and obtain further help, in order that
the Indians may not be left in utter des
titution while they are waiting for Bishop
Joseph Johnson of the Episcopal church
to plead their cause in Washington, D. C.
Some time- ago â¢ these missionaries, who
are connected j| with, the ; Boyle Heights
Training' School for Christian Workers,
went up into the mountains to preach to
the Indians. They traveled in their "gos
pel wagon" and penetrated' to ;. some of
the most distant points of the mountains.
Such abject distress was found, they say,
that they abandoned the attempt at gos
pel preaching for the * present, and re
turned to seek relief for the physical
needs of the unfortunate S natives, who
are said to be slowly starving to death
within the reach of civilization.

YOU!! OWN FAULT
"Why? Because you have neglected to
kill the germs causing the disease. They
still remain In your throat or lungs and
will continue there until destroyed. Not
only thla, but by using cough syrups, ex-
pectorants and morphine mixtures, your
stomach, liver and kidneys have become
disordered, and the germs of cither bron-
chitis, pneumonia or consumption firmly
Implanted in those Inflamed . spots on the
air passages, caused by cough germsâ
and all through your own fault.
Had you kept abreast of the times and
read the opinion of .the best medical au-
thority in the land, published regularly,
you would have known that coughs are
caused by germs and that all the stomach
medicines ln the world Â¦ cannot reach
them. If you had read th* United States
Health Reports, .and looked up Govern-
ment statistics, as every man and woman
ought, you would have known that there-
Is but^ one remedy which- will destroy
these germs, and that this remedy has re-
duced the death rate from such diseases
34 per cent during the past year. This
is not newspaper talk, but facts from
the highest authorities in the land. Â¦Â¦
HTOMEI. the new treatment, cures be-
cause it kills the germs of coughs, croup,
catarrh, bronchitis and consumption, and
all you have to do is to inhale it for a
few moments daily.
Now if you wish "to keep your cough all
winter' and run the risk of contracting more
serious diseases, continue as you are wita
stomach medicines. If not, send to The R. T.

"The victims were. in charge of James Brown.
No : excuse Â¦ has been offered '. or,' can : be . given
for the lynching. .. After being Â¦ in 1 " his hands
for. a Ehort: time, the . testimony is, they, were
taken out. . not by a hostile mob, - but by. his
neighbors, as Brown ! afterward . said that \ he
did not try to protect them, but abandoned
Mob, Met No Â« Resistance.
He pictured . the sleeping .victims in
Myers' barroom, and ' detailed from Â¦ the
evidence; of Hutton, Morris,'Brown'him
self and others, given before the ' Grand
Jury, how the five men, were overpowere'd
and dragged to their death. In this con
nection Sturtevant: said:
Sturtevant admonished the. Jurors that
they must not draw inferences from: the
fact that Brown did not take -the stand
in his own defense, because it was Â¦ his
constitutional privilege. The attorney,
however, drew attention to the. fact that
the other defendants and competent wit
nesses had not been sworn to contradict
Hutton and Morris.
Sturtevant asked why old man Hall had
been put into a room where he could. have
been so easily found, and asked why the
fifth rope, which was left outside, had not
been distributed with the t rest, and'an
swered his own questiom by stating that
some of the lynchers would have protest
ed against the hanging, of .the old, gray
haired man and would have backed out
of the conspiracy had they, known that he
was to be one of the victims. Â¦
in the tieing of the ropes in Trowbridge's
store on the afternoon of May 30 .went
to Trowbrldge"s - store and reported to
Trowbridge how the Job. had turned out.
Sturtevant claimed .that Morris, in his
testimony on the stand and in his confes
sion, did not state a single thin? but
what he knew; that he made no guesses
or told anything that he was not^abso
lutely positive of.. He continued:.-
Kow gentlemen of the Jury, here is a hostile
mob that came from widely separated sections.
How in the name of God did they know old
man Hall was in the hotel? Word had gone
Su of the hotel. Dick NlchoU. J. W. Brown,
Erv Carpenter and J. R. Myers are the only
oÂ£Â» wnT could have grlven the information
Yet the derense has set up the claim that these
parties did' not leave the barroonv during that
night How did those two men who went Into
tbfparlorto get old man Hall, as testified to
by Sid Goyette. know that old man_ Hall was
in the parlor? It must have' been the original
I ntention of the . lynchers Â¦, to hang_old man
Hall, as they brought five, ropes. Frank Hall
must have. put up a fight, because Jim Brown
told Charles Lamberth and Myron Ayres that
he did. and this testimony has. not. been con
tradicted by any witness for. the. defense..
the five ' men Just' as much as he could aban
don anybody under any circumstances. Brown
performed no part of his official duty as Â¦ an
officer of the. law. He should have said to
those prisoners: "Get up and defend your
selves. Get those pistols out from behind the
bar." . Then â¢ they would have cleaned the
whole mob out.
Brown knew that the . mob was coming. He
was Informed on Monday that Â¦ there was talk
of ' hanging these men. . Justice of - the Peace
Myers, who, â¢â¢. above all others, .was bound by
law to / protect these men, knew Â¦ they Â¦ were
going to be lynched. He told Ira Cannon. they
were going to be lynched. : I feel sorry -for
that old man, in the : evening of life, getting
mixed 'up in a matter of this kind. , -
Sturtevant next urged'' the unreliability
of the testimony given by different mem
bers of the Myers family to: establish an
alibi for Samuel Parks. The State's j at
torney spoke scathingly of the Myers
family, charging that they all knew j the'
mob was coming to hang; the men.
,Sturtevant paid particular attention : to
the. testimony, of; George Howell, who,,
when called as a witness for the prosecu
tion in the early part of the trial, testified
that he was not in "; Lookout on May ' 27,"
and when during this week- he was re
called, surprised the prosecution -by say
ing that he had been there that dayv He
censured Mrs. Walter Rucker for the tes
timony she gave, which minutely detailed
every movement of - Richard . Nichols >' for
nearly the whole of May. 30, and he indi
cated to the jury the impossibility of 'any
person remembering trivial i domestic in
cidents when nothing important happened
on that, date to fix these incidents in the
memory.
Referring to Mrs. Richard .,' Nichols,
whose : husband " and brother . are'- accused
of having participated in the lynching
Sturtevant praised .her for , her Â¦ energy,
her : fidelity , and : her fortitude, and . said
that not one ' word . of criticism ' could ;â¢ be
uttered against her. : She was only doing
what "any noble wife or/sister* would 'do
under similar . circumstances/ Â¦
â¢ The defense will open' its argument on
Monday, morning.; , ; / . .-â¢Â¦Â¦
ALTURAS, Feb. 15.â doping arguments
were begun this morning' in the trial of
James W. Brown, the alleged Lookout
lyncher, and by the middle of next weÂ«k
the fate of the prisoner will rest in the
hands of the Jury. The courtroom, was
thronged with a curious audience, men
and women coming from points many
miles distant to hear the oratory of the
attorneys. Deputy Attorney General*
George W. Sturtevant occupied the entire
day for the prosecution, reviewing the evi
dence that tends to show James W. Brown
to be one of the leaders in the conspiracy,
which. Sturtevant charged, was hatched
in Liookout last May to rid that section
of old Calvin Hall, "Jim" Hall, Frank
Hall. Daniel Yantis and young Martin
Wilson. In opening, Sturtevant said:
May It please the court and you, sentlemen
of the Jury: "We have now come to the last
stage ol this long ca.ee. Gentlemen ol the
jury. I want to mark you personally for the
kinaness with which you have listened to our
wrangles and listened to our witnesses and
given this case the complete and careful at
tention you have given It during this lone
period. In regard to the duties of parties in
this case, I will Â«ay the defendant is repre
sented by four able counsel, members of the
Supreme Court of this State, and it is their
duty to acquit the defendant by all means at
their disposal.
The position mt the counsel for the people is
this: They are salaried officers; to them it
makes no possible diCerence what may be the
result in the case. They are not concerned
in a.- verdict, except that it is their sworn
duty, however, bitter It may be, to bring be
fore the jury the evidence, to present to the
court the law and then to ask of you a ver
dict that one of your fellow men be hanged by
the neck until he be dead. If you believe
that this man is innocent, the counsel for the
prosecution asks you earnestly to acquit him.
But if you come to a conclusion that this man
is guilty, then the whole State of California
demands at your hands a verdict according to
the evidence.
Baker Interrupts Sturtevant.
I do not ask you to consider the enormity
of the crime in determining whether the de
ler.dant is guilty or Innocent, but If you do
Una him guilty, the enormity of the crime is
euch that the whole people of the State of
California would come over here into Modoc and
say: '"Stand up and be the citizens you have
ewora yourselves to be." The indictment charges
the deiendani. on the 31st of May last, with
having willfully and with malice aforethought
murdered Martin Wilson. The evidence com
mences on ilay 27, when some of these par
ties, including Martin Wilson, -were arrested
and taken to Myers' Hotel in a manner that
lust showed a bitter feeling on the part of
tijÂ£ arresting officers.
Here Deputy Attorney General Sturte
vant was interrupted by Baker.
Raker â I take exception to the language of
the counsel in regard to these arrests. " We
attempted to show in good faith and by facts
leading up to the arrests that these men were
legitimately charged with having committed a
public oCense.
Sturtevant â I don't object to the counsel
taking exceptions, but I do object to a speech
Jrpm him."
â We do not deny the authority for
mailing the arrests, but we desire to show the
exttssive brutality of the arresting officers,
who exceeded their duties in the manner of
making the arrests.
The court â Mr. Raker, I anticipated disturb
ance in this argument by you and in advance
very kindly and courteously laid down the par
liamentary rules by which the argument should
be conducted. If you wish to violate these
rules I will remove you from the courtroom.
Sturtevant described Calvin Hail as a
man who had gone through the war,
serving- his country for many years, and,
when he had reached, bis 73d year, was
prodded about the country with a gun
in the hands of "Jim" Brown and mali
ciously ill-treated in other ways and fin
ally swung over a bridge at Lookout, a
rope around his neck, the victim of lynch
ers.
Analysis of the Testimony.
Sturtevant then commenced an analysis
of the testimony of the principal wit
nesses for the defense. He said in part:
The little half-breed witness, Agnes Wilson,
was entirely irsuik. On cross-examination she
showed freely that Ehe believed her brother,
Martin "vVilsdh, was murdered and I wished
somebody to be punished for it She also
hoped Jim Brown would be punished for the
way he had abused Calvin HalL She also told
you about the Indecent search of her mother
a.nd herself by this defendant.
The testimony of Claude Morris showed a
bitter feeling between the Trowbrldge and
ilorris factions, and it is too clear that in
order to keep down all inquiring elements it
Was necessary to get one of Morns' fingers
In the pie, in order to close the mouth of tue
Morris faction. And Claude Morris was not
the only one roped in; others were roped In
and made "cat paws" of, not that their help
was needed, but their silence must be pro
cured. It is admitted that Morris denied be

ment. He made that statement voluntarily

-A' chance question in the Commons from a Liberal who wished to harass the Ministry a
little raised a controversy concerning the relations of the various powers to the .United States
at the outbreak of the Spanish , war. Lord Cranborne, who spoke ' for the Ministry, made state
ments which" implied that other ; powers had been unfriendly to the United States while Great
Britain had been friendly.- The statement was promptly challenged by other v powers and by
Germany in particular. Â¦ The result has been a revelation that Pauncefote, after President , Mc-
Kinley had declined to accept any mediation or interference' from the powers, had undertaken in
Washington to get.the powers to unite'in a joint noteof protest against a declaration of war on '
our:part. Lord Cranborne has now asserted that Pauncefote â¢had no authority from his Govern
ment make '.'any such' suggestion.;. Â¦. The venerable dipipmatist is therefore revealed (as an or^^^
ciou's meddler in business that did not concern -him and that exceeded his powers. He will now
go out of officeunder a blight. He ,is one more man who stayed in the ring too long. He should Â¦
have-quit the game: 'while fortune waswitri' him; ' - '
Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦..- *
WHEN Lord Pauncefote went home to England last summer it was reported that he
would retire from "Â¦'the active work of diplomacy' and settle himself down to a well-earned
repose. It would have .been s good thing for him had the report been true. His
lordship is an old man, and last summer he was at the climax of diplomatic good
fortune. He was nearly as much esteemed in. this country as in his own. He was looked upon
as the man who had stood up for the United States against the diplomatists of. Europe, and en
joyed a greater popularity than perhaps any other British Minister who ever served at Washing
ton. Had he retired .^at that time,, therefore, he would have carried with him to his home all
the honors and dignities that rightly accompany an illustrious life;
Unfortunately for himself he did not know when. to quit. He developed an ambition to
remain in the harness long enough to complete the Nicaraguan canal treaty, and to arrange for
the settlement of other. questions that are at issue between the United ' States and Great- Britain.
He doubtless believed that the good opinion, he .had gained among the. American people would
be helpful, in solving '-diplomatic problems without friction; -and so he put away all thoughts of
retirement and returned to Washington in high hopes and with bright prospects.

Micnelena, 7 elder, ; sister - of I* Miss .Vera.
whom Mr.< Slocum is also very desirous of
adding to the Klrke â¢ La Shelle forces.
While there . Is : here no question' of a
phenomenal .voice' or; talent,-, there is, a
pretty voice well trained,. and another re
markably: pretty girl, to boot, who should
add much to the laurels of the State some
day.;- Miss iBeatrice has arrived at. the
mature age of IS, and, like her slater, will
probably continue 'her -studies for some
time to come. , ; In addition ', to > this Mr."
Slocum' has promised ; to lend an enthusi
astic " ear , at any .time to . .any of the
Michelena ; pupils ; whom > Mr. Â« Michelena
considers Â¦ worthy of ' a , hearing, which.
It is not at all probable*, however, that
the talented girl will enter for some time
yet* upon the flattering career so suddenly
opened to her. It was her. own and her
parents' Intention that she should become
a Binger in graad opera, and that is how
It may come out '; after all. Meantime,
this little lass iwith ' the wonderful voica
will stay at home and study, under 4 the
tutelage of her father, and in a year there
will be more ' to i hear of her.
Her parents are both devoted to the art,
and It will be remembered that Michelena,
now. perhaps the leading exponent of the
art of singing here, was for many years
principal tenor, with. .Emma Abbott.
Neither is his work of late years at the
TIvoll forgotten of the faithful. But it
came f as a matter of surprise s to the
Michelenas, as to most parents, when the
offer of a five-year contract with .the
KIrke La Shelle management for. their
16-year-old {daughter i revealed the fact
that the little girl was a child no longer
to outside eyes. For that is how Mr. Slo
cum is prepared to back his opinion of
Miss Vera Michelena. He offers, in the
name of his company, to give the young
girl a five-year, contract, during . which
time she is to play leading parts for the
first year and to star, for the, remainder
of the engagement, ' the Â¦ offer Â¦ to remain
open ; indefinitely. ; He further prophesies
a complete and immediate success for the
young Californian, whenever she shall
make her appearance on the stage, and
is nothing short of extravagant in her
praise. . "3Â£HB â¢ . '
IT will be no matter of astonishment to
any true Calif ornian, who freely con
fesses himself above the possibility of
surprise ) in the regard, to learn that
. John .Palmer Slocum, manager of the
Kirk La Shelle attractions, has discovered
here a coming comic opera star of the
first magnitude. It fell out rather curlos
ly that the desertion of Marguerite Sylva
from the leading role In "Princess Chic."
just before that attractively pirated opera
made Its appearnce here, should affect, al
together pleasantly, the fortune's of three
Californian singers. Miss Maude Lillian
Berrl "was the first, and her competent
and taking performance, In, Miss Sylva' s
part is still fresh in the mind of the local
patriot, and at his" tongue's end when the
made in California things are' mentioned. 1
The other is a different' story. % I
'"When the original Princess Chic de
serted the company at Denver, the appar
ent catastrophe was the means of bring
ing out from' New York the Kirk La
Shelle manager, J. P. Slocum. at a pace
only compatible with the movements of
those unfortunates dependent upon the
capricious pleasure T of the prima donna.
The immediate success, of Miss Berrl: in
the role she assumed so hastily rendered
that part of Mr. Slocum's duty of the
lightest^ and he then began the usual im
presarial voyage of discovery.
It is the impresario's habit, as well as
his duty and sometimes pleasure, to give
a hearing to the aspirant for operatic
honors in every town, to which his fortune
takes him. So_ stars are found, and the
search is pursued with the zest and ex
citement of a hunt for burled treasure
generally with the same result be It said.
It happened differently this time, how
ever, and Mr. Slocum thinks that in Miss
Vera Michelena, the daughter of Fer
nando Michelena, he has found that of
which every, manager is in searchâ a new
star. He is by way of saying that Miss
Michelena is In all respects the most ex
ceptionally well-equipped young woman
that he has ever happened across In his
managerial experience, musically gifted
with a lovely voice, a robust, musicianly
sense and a technical attainment that
makes her limited years an unmitigated
astonishment. She has further a viva
cious, bonnie beauty that spells perfect
health, and a personality of sound, whole
some, unspoiled charm.
Miss Michelena comes naturally enough
by her musical faculty.
The Tivoli will have afgrand' opera sea

securing Italy, for the best. material to be
obtained, and its ' light opera . programme
contains '"The Serenade," .': "The = Fortune

this year/ and .the clever company comes

also promises a Melbourne MacDowell
season, Edward Harrigan : for a" week or

the season. Miss Elliston was with Mr.
Miller last summer, It will be remember
ed. It has been. rumored that NatC Good

have a dramatic separation, the difficulty
of finding plays for co-stars being more
than common. But they will be seen here
together in "When .We Were Â¦Â¦" Twenty
one," some time this summer, which
means another good rumor gone wrong
for some time, at any rate. Blanche
Walsh is another coming Columbia at
traction and will be seen in "La Made

Differently, but equally attractive, wiil
be the Henry Miller engagement, more
particularly from the fact that Mr.
Miller's company will be adorned this
year with the presence of Margaret An

Mr. Miller's last season. ,* Miller, brings
with him several new plays, among them
H. V. Esmond's latest achievement. "The
Wilderness," "Frocks and \ Frills" and
"Trelawney of the Wells,'? not to men
tion "Heartsease," which is perennial as
a Patti farewell tour. "The Second in
Command," with John Drew, the gentle
manly, conservative and polished, is also
on the cards, with a brilliant record to Its
name so far, j though John Drew as an
awkward .major who comes in only for
the crumbs that fall from the banquet of
life has a role that Is . unfamiliar to his
peculiar excellencies.
Mrs. Pat Campbell, the famous English
actress for whom a prominent journal of
her ' native London fears a dramatic
coarsening from, the American stage, will
doubtless attract a large attention here
on her forthcoming visit. She wiil be
seen most probably In "The Notorious
Mrs. Ebbsmith," "Magda"/ or "The Sec
ond Mrs. Tanqueray." William Gillette,
who won out so blithely over . the
"booing" cabal that was raised against
him in London recently, will bring "Sher

son, and it is said that for a perfect fit
between actor ' and part Gillette's Sher
lock Holmes Is impossible to beat. It is
not less impossible to estimate the com
parative popularity of the actor and the
famous detective he represents.
people and plays seem to be heading this
way. Richard Mansfield comes with the
new play made from Booth Tarklngton's
book "Beaucalre," in which the great
actor Is said to have a great opportunity,
though the rest of the company pines
vainly for a whack at the center of the
stage.
PANTOMIMIST WHO HEADS THE
LIST OF ATTRACTIONS AT THE
NEW FISCHER THEATER. â¢
His arrest followed upon exposure, and after several vain attempts to evade punishment,
after lying like another' Ananias, he was at last cornered and pleaded guilty.. ,.< â¢ ,
Then ensued one of the most disgraceful incidents that ever disfigured California juris
prudence. The Superior Judge before whom he was arraigned stood him up for sentence. This
' Judge in passing sentence said: "I have investigated his character and find that during the, last
five years it has been excellent. He served his country three years, , and during the last two has
been employed as a motorman in San Francisco and Oakland. Outside this last trouble his con
duct has been exemplary. Lieutenant Allison, under whom he served, told me that he had always
been sober, and faithful to the flag under which he served. So good a soldier 'cannot be alto- .
gether bad." A . Â¦'"Â¦'.
Then addressing the scoundrel this remarkable Judge said: "As .by. pleading guilty you
havesaved the county the expense of a trial, and have shown that you intend to live down this
disgrace, I do not think leniency will be misplaced in this case," and proceeded to give him one
year in the penitentiary! . <''Â¦''Â¦Â¦}Â¦;:''
â¢It is difficult to write calmly of this Judge. During the five years that the fellow was a
wife-deserter, guilty of the most sneaking, sinister- and injurious offense against morals* the
Judge regarded his conduct as "exemplary." That means, woithy to be, followed, deserving of
imitation. According to his darkened judicial mind wife desertion is- worthy of all praise and
. general imitation, sohe complimented the wsetch who sneaked away from his faithful wife and
the little children she 'had borne him. A part of this exemplary conduct consisted in his en
deavor to entrap another virtuous girl into a bigamous marriage, before he captured his last
victim. This Judge, this lawyer, this remarkable person who is supposed to know the law of the
marriage contract, regards this as evidence of good character! If the fellow had forged, a note
for $25 it would have been heinous misconduct. But he merely forged for himself a character
and passed it upon an innocent lady to her undoing, and the Judge compliments him upon his .
purpose to live down this little slip! Not a word for the poor girl who was the victim of the .
worst that can befall a woman, disgraced by the lying false pretenses of this deserter of his
lawful wife and children. "Leniency," says this Dogberry, "will not be misplaced." Had he
possessed the notions of morality that were the virtues of a Piute Indian, he would have realized
the enormity of the offense against its victim and through her against society. But instead, he
issues judicial license to that class of offenders, weeps on their shoulders and is gratified that
1 they will "live down" the peccadillo! ' :;?::'Â¦
Going now to the complimented recipient of this star brand of judicial leniency, let us
study his exemplary character in his own comments after being taken back to jail. This wife
deserter and bigamist said: "I'm a lucky, man. I;- was afraid I'd get the limit. I consider; myself
.well out of this trouble." Then speaking of his victim he -said: "I will not say one word agairist
./her. It is her relatives who have poisoned' her mind against me.".. .._ r ' v ,. .,< .
We desire the- parents of daughters to read that and see if they can admire "the* exem
plary character" of such a moral monster. Let them note his serious intimation ,that the virtuous
girl he had entrapped into a non-legal, bigamous marriage had not the self-respect and regard
for her character to resent his crime, but her parents had to /"poison her' mind" against
her destroyer! ;
The fathers and mothers of Alameda will have the opportunity some day to express their
opinion of the Judge who defiles the berichand the ermine by his maudlin slobber over this en
emy of womanhood and destroyer of happiness.
The poor woman is left to support a child to be born out of legal wedlock, to bear the
burning burden put upon her by this subject of judicial compliment -and leniency, who has
added another to the list of innocent children he strews upon the world in his career of "exem
plary conduct."
If anything were needed to add to the luster.of the bench it is found in another sentence
imposed directly afterward by the' same Judge upon a man who, during an assault, had broken
another, man's leg. He got eighteen months in the penitentiary! In'the judicial judgment it is
a higher crime to break a man's leg than to break a woman's heart, tarnish her name and make
her a mother without having been a wife. . " â¢ '' ' t
,'Â¦ Â¦'â¢ But the man was a scoundrel, a wretch of the lowest order, a cur on two feet. He. had.
| deserted a good wife and his young children in Pennsylvania, left them to starve or to charity , v
arifl had hidden his miserable jdentkyby_ enlisting for the Philippines. Bullet and bolo struck
dead better men , and this; wife-deserter escaped, served out liis enlistment and .came back to his
Â¦ own country to deceive another gentle and trusting woman. The â¢ publicity given to his big
amous marriage was the means of carrying it to the deserted wife, and the awful i.news of 'the
deception of which she had been the victim was. sent to the stricken girl' in Oakland. With-: it
came the information that before the wretch met her he had attempted to marry another good

The skin is the seat of an almost end*
less variety of diseases. They are knewa
by various names, but are all due to the
same cause,' acid and other poisons in
the blood that irritate and interfere with
the proper action of the skin.
To have a smooth, soft skin, free from
all.eruptions, the blood must be kept pura
and healthy. The many preparations o!
arsenic and potash and the large number
of face powders and lotions generally
used in this class of diseases cover up
for a short time, but cannot remove per-
manently the ugly blotches and the red,
disfiguring pimples.
Eternal vigilance is the price
of a beautiful complexion
when such remedies are relied on.
Mr. H. T. Shobe, 3704 1.ucas Avenue, St. I/Kiis,
Mo., says : "My daughter was afflicted for years
with a disfiguring eruption on her face, which
resisted all treatment. She was taken to two
celebrated health springs, but received no bene-
fit. Many medicines were prescribed, but with-
out result, until we decided to try S. S. S., and by
the time the first bottle tÂ« as finished the eruption
began to disappear. A dozen bottles cured bet
completely and left her Â»kin perfectly smooth.
She 13 now seventeen year3 old, and not a sign of
the embarrassing disease hzs ever returned."
S. S. S. is a positive, unfailing cure for
the worst f orm3 of skin troubles. It is
the greatest of all blood purifiers, and the
only one guaranteed purely vegetable.

Dubois offered an amendment providing
that the director of. the census shall col
lect annually statistics concerning the
business of trusts or industrial combina
tions, the . Â¦â¢ statistics â¢ to be collected
through reparts,made to the director by
the responsible heads of such concerns and
to cover all details of the business. The
amendment was rejected, 17 to 31, the
vote being along strict party lines, except
that McEnery (D.) of Louisiana voted
against the amendment.
On motion of Teller the bill -was amend
ed so as to provide for an assistant di
rector of the census at a salary of $1000
per annum /and further that the terms
of appointment of both the direct and
assistant director should be four years.
-An. amendment was offered by Allison
and adopted, providing that In the annual
collection of statistics of births : and
deaths the data shall be obtained enly
from registration areas. .
"That all employes of the census office,
except unskilled laborers, at the date of
the passage of this act shall be and they
are hereby placed without further exam
ination under the provision of the civil
service act." â¢
'The discussion continued for some time,
practically the whole civil service system
being .threshed over. Finally Gallmger
gave notice of an amendment,, declaring
that persons who had served as soldiers
in any war in which the United States
has engaged and the widows of such sol
diefs snail. have preference in the matter
of certification. I J^odge's amendment was
rejected without division. Gallinger then
offered his amendment. It was accepted
by Quarles, in charge of the bill, and it
was adopted. Many ineffectual efforts
wore made to amend section. 5. Finally
on motion of McComas, the first para
graph of section 5; was amended so as to
read :
In support of his amendment Lodge
argued mat if all the, persons at present
in the employ of the census office should
bj placed aroitrarily within the classified
service without further examination, . it
would work a hardship upon ' those who
had taken civil service examinations and
were oa the eligible list. â¢ .
The pending ; amendment was that of
Lodge to amend [ the paragraph relating
to the retention of employes so that it
would read that "all employes of the
twelfth census ; office at ihe date of the
paseage of this act who were, retained in
the employ of the permanent census,
above tne grade of ; skilled laborer, shall
be' and they are hereby placed without
further examination unaer the provisions
of the civil service act." , ,
\;The great contest of the day, of course,
was' over -the transfer to the. classified?
service of the employes of the census of-j
flee -. who are to be retained in the perma

COPENHAGEN, Feb. 15.â The Mormons
are making strong efforts to gain a per

torious that this little country has fur
nished a large quota of emigrants for
Utah, where there are thousands of Dan

Danish missionaries who have been sent
to work in their native land have not

were here to gain converts to their reli

Davis Proposes an Appeal.
Replying to a question by Senator Car
mack, he raid that he had not considered
the problem of possible statehood fifty
years hence. He ; would . favor a promise
even of a form of government; ; such ' as
is . given the . Territories of; the United
St&tes. He â¢ also ' said he was opposed to
extending the constitution to those isl-
Governor Taft advocated the establish
ment of a stable government for the'pres
ent, with the understanding that some
time in the future the Americans and the
Filipinos could reach an agreement as to
what should be done in the way of gov
ernment or, in maintaining relations;
"but,"- he said, "whether the islands
should have their independence, whether
they should be given a quasi independence
or. whether they should ' be made a State
of the Union is so far in the future that
I have reached no conclusion."-. '
Senators Patterson, Carmack and Cul
berson asked numerous questions based
upon the memorial from the Federal par
ty, calculated to bring out Governor
Taf t's idea as to what, if any, promise
had been made to the Filipinos in the
way of government for the future. .
"No, .it. was not," " Governor Taft re
sponded. He gave the names of several
prominent Filipinos who had assisted in
the organization. They had, he said, con
sulted the members of the commission
and the latter had encouraged the forma
tion as far as possible, because the party
was for peace. ' The promise of state
hood had been no prominent part of the
mission work of the leaders.
"Was not the commission responsible
for the formation of the Federal party?"
asked Senator Dubois.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15.â The hearing
of Governor Tift on the Philippine ques
tion by the Senate Committee on the
Philippines began to-day with a series of
questions by Senator Patterson. in regard
to the fitness of Filipinos for 'jury duty.
Patterson asked whether the native pop
ulation on which the voting: franchise is
bestowed could not be trusted to do jury
duty. The Governor replied in the nega
tive, saying they are so used to corrup
tion in the administration of Justice that
they could not be trusted.
"They need to bf. trained," he said, "to
have examples: they are not ready for
jury duty."
Referring: to the code of procedure in
the islands Governor Taft said in reply
to a question by Senator Culberson that
it Is an American code rather . than a
Spanish code. Under the Spanish regime,
said Governor Taft, the courts were /not
only sluggish, but notoriously corrupt,
and the first courts established by Gen
eraJ Otis were no better. Under Spanish
rule there was a substantial denial of
justice.
Referring to the petition of the Federal
party Governor Taft said all cases of Im
priEpnment referred to were for military
and not civil offenses. Practically there
are no civil prosecutions for political of
fenses at this time. Governor Taft said
the original draft of the Federal party
platform had been submittted to the com
mission and that the declaration for
statehood was then more explicit and
was ultimately adopted.
"My recollection/' he said, "is that we
said to the representatives of the party
that this must be far in the future and
that we could make no > promises one
way or the other.".
: The protocol has been prepared in the
Spanish language, and Herran will under

probable it will not be turned over to Ad

five articles and is a very lengthy docu
ment. Admiral I Walker, it is explained,

Peculiar Power Possessed by a
New Medicine.
Of new discoveries there is no end, but one of
the moat- recent, most remarkable and one
â¢which will prove Invaluable to : thousands - of
people, is a'dlscoverey which it. is believed will
take the place of all other; remedies for the
cure of those common and obstinate diseases,
dyspepsia and stomach troubles. . This 'discov-
ery is not a loudly advertised, secret patent
medicine, but is a scientific â¢ combination of
wholesome, perfectly" * harmless .' vegetable es-
sences, fruit salts, pure pepsin and bismuth.
These remedies are combined In lozenge form,
pleasant to take, . and will preserve their good
qualities | indefinitely, .whereas all , liquid | medi-
cines rapidly lose whatever good qualities they
may have had as soon as uncorked and exposed
to the air. , , .
This preparation is called Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets and it is claimed that one of these tab-
lets or ,. lozenges .will digest from .300 to 3000
times its own weight of meat, eggs and other
wholesome food. .And . this . claim has been
proven by actual experiments in the ; following
manner: -jA â¢ hard boiled egg cut into j small
pieces was placed in a'; bottle containing warm
% water heated to ninety-eight degrees (or blood
heat), one of these Tablets was then placed sin
the bottle * and ' ; the ; proper temperature main-'
tained for three hours and a half, at the endof
which. time the egg was as completely digested
as it would have been in a healthy stomach.
This experiment was undertaken to demonstrate
that what' it wouldrdo; in the bottle It would
also do In the stomach, hence its unquestionable
value in the cure of dyspepsia and weak diges-
tion. ,',Very few' people are free from some form
of j indigestion, | but scarcely two will ; have I the"
same /symptoms.' Some ; will | suffer- most from
distress after eating,', bloating from gas in the
stomach and bowels,'; others have add dyspepsia
or heartburn, ' others palpitation '; or headaches,
sleeplessness, pains in chest and "under shoulder
blades, ; extreme nervousness as in nervous dys-
pepsia," but they all have same cause, failure to
properly , digest 'what is 'eaten. *'. The i stomach
must ;have >' rest .and ,' assistance, ': and v Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets give it both/, by digesting the
food for it and in a short time it Is restored to
its normal action and vigor. At same time the
. Tablets are so . harmlera , that a r child can â¢ take
them > with > benefit; s :Â¦ This new " preparation - has
already i made â¢ many 'Â¦. astonishing cures - as . lor

City Attorney Lane filed an opinion yes
terday that the city cannot relieve Itself
from liability for damages caused by mob
violence in the vicinity of the Presidio by
requiring a bond from saloon-keepers.
Lane says:
The discretion and judgment of the Police
Commission In granting permits seems to be
the one protection upon which the city must
rely. As the law does not provide for a bond
the commission cannot demand It.
City Cannot Exact Bond.

The ; novel , of the water ris

Public i Ownership Helps Labor.
. u lie aaaress was Â¦ devoted entirely to
municipal ownership and the lecturer won
great ; applause throughout, the delivery
He set out to show the advantages of the
people controlling the municipal utilities,
for, said, he, public ownership means
lower : rates, and that, he submitted,'
touched the pocket nerve where the Am
erican was. sensitive.,' He illustrated the
water rate in- Oakland* and other cities,
and in . the Â¦ former he declared the rate
should not.be more than $8 or 510, where
'It Is actually $75. So, continued Mr. Par
sons, ;. puoiic. ownership would mean. In
that direction lower rates. The people
might have; the 'money -which was now.
going int^. the pockets of a monopoly.
Foreign Cities More* Cheaply Served.
, '. Referring to the Â¦ electric light system,
the speaker showed > by figures and . com
parison C how .-. much more . reasonably are
, the r people of foreign countries served,
where the municipalities own and control
/ the electric ,. plants. It is, he . said, . the
; same with " gas ; and the ; railway systems.
For', the , former;. the reduction has been
as , much 'as 50. per cent, and in France
the reduction in the telephone rate is one
half of , what the rates were. In Germany
similar - conditions " obtained. Since Eng
land had taken over the telegraphs; there
has been a reduction of from 30 to 50 per
cent- 1 in \ the cost to the people.
â¢ When. the' publlo utilities, shall be part
of Â¦ the public * service Â¦ the profits will go
into. the. public treasury and not into the
pockets of. a few private monopolists, the
speaker said.'' 'He asked *why;the people
of. this city allowed the street' railways to
remaln'In i private hands. But he :s con
fidently v expected , to ; see sthe'pjople here
take the street lines. under their, own con
trol. "Their. Mayor, he said, had tho fire
of the ' future In his heart and - he . (the
Mayor) had' said to him. that .undoubtedly
the city would Â¦ control the street railway.
But, ' asked Mr. - Parsons,- why only rail
ways? And here the lecturer pointed out
that the ; telephone service was too high;
as was - also ; the ' gas - charge, and as for

Frank Parsons, a student of munifcipal
matters, not f alone , in this , country, but
versed Â¦ in civic affairs of â¢ all the chief
cities of ( Europe, delivered an adress last
eyening at the Academy of Sciences to
one of the largest audiences seen in . the
hall :for a long Awhile. .'Mr. Parsons has
the happy faculty of, keeping his hearers
thoroughly interested, notalone with the
subject of his discourse, ; but also with
some happy anecdotes," of which he has
a rare fund. And what is more, 1 the pleas
antries which. Mr. Parsons injects into
his lecture are part and parcel of the
subject under discussion.
Mayor Schmitz found that nine employes
of the hospital sleep in one room twenty
by thirty feet, which he. says Is in viola
tion of the cubic air law. Other bad con
ditions exist, and the conference with the
Board of Health wiir result in the correc
tion of the abuses.: The Mayor will strong
ly urge that separate "wards 'be, used for
the accommodation of consumptive . pa
tients. The - visit .of inspection' occupied
exactly two hours, and , nothing that
would tend toT effect an improvement in
the institution was .overlooked., . . '
Mayor Schmitz ami Supervisors . d'An
cona and Alpers of the Health and Hos
pital Committee of. the Board , of Super
visors made an official visit of inspection
to the City and County Hospital yester
day. The need of improvements in the in
stitution as itemized by the Grand Jury
in a communication filed with the board
last Monday was thoroughly. invest ; gated.
Mayor Schmitz finds that the â¢ conditions
as reported by * the Grand Jury are cor
rect, and- his Honor says that he Â¦ found
many other things that make the hospital
a standing disgrace to the community and
an outrage on the municipality. â¢
One of the results of the investigation
will be the recommendation by the Mayor
that a number " of useless officials em
ployed at the hospital be dispensed with.
It was found that, in some cases the em
ployes are not necessary, and; it. is quite
likely that a reduction in {he force will (be
made, and the saving so â¢ effected will be
used to employ more nurses, of which the
hospital : stands . sadly â¢ in -. need. .t To;: that
end the: Mayor .will/ have a conference
with the Board of Health some time next
week, when .the '.subject will be .discussed
and some remedy outlined.

land, the'property nearly all being located
in Wyoming. The purchase price is $5,
875,000, and the members of the syndicate
who have paid this large, sum are capi

C. A. Canfield of L03 Angeles, at pres

owners in the'land that was sold. He-was
the discoverer of the oil fields in Los An

the Coallnga oil field was a bonanza. This

1039 MARKET,^OPPOSITE McALLlSTCR. \A. bold â¢ burglary was . reported to i the
police at the Central station, yesterday
morning. When Herman Sommers,, pro
prietor of the Mutual Loan Office at 535
Pacific street, went to his place of busi
ness after ' several days' . absence, due . to
a death in the family, he found that
thieves had entered from the rear and
taken watches and jewelry ' valued at
J1000. When the crime was committed no
one knows, but Sommers thinks it hap
pened during Friday night. : '
Three day 8 ago Sommers' infant child
died and he closed his place of business.
He returned yesterday morning for the
purpose of attending to some private af
fairs and was startled to - discover that
the rear door, had been forced with- a
'â¢jlmmle" and was open. Further Investi
gation showed that the showcases had
been looted and four trays of watches, in
addition to much more stock of ..value,
had been taken.
Sommers immediately reported the mat
ter to Captain of Detectives Seymour and
that official detailed two of his men to
hunt up. the robbers. The police are of
the opinion that some one well acquainted
with the premises committed the crime.
more important question could engage the
attention of thoughtful men and women.
The first speaker was Osgood Putnam,
who spoke on "Probation." The term pro
bation applied to a convict who is turned
at large but is always under police sur
veillance. If he did well he was not mo
lested, but If he - resorted .to evil ways
during his probation he was immediately
returned to prison. The -speaker contend
ed that the modern treatment of prison
ers was all wrong. Punishment for wrong
doing is logical- only when its aims arc
the reformation of the criminal and Â¦ the
protection of society. The , results at
tained by the probationary law of Massa
chusetts were explained as being highly
satisfactory. The courts were allowed
by law to suspend sentences and grant
criminals their freedom, they, however,
to remain in charga of a probation of
ficer. If after a reasonable period refor
mation is accomplished the case against
the criminal is dismissed and he is a free
man. The system in vogue in California
was severely criticized. Criminals ./who
go, to the State's prison come out more
depraved than ever. While it is true so
ciety is protected against their depreda
tions during the. period of their detention,
yet when they get out^they make up for
.lost time. Experience shows that- the
present system does not reform the crim
inal or permanently protect society. It
follows, therefore, that the plan Is worse
than useless. It is because of this knowl
edge that many Eastern States, as well
as Canada, have within . the . past few
years enacted probation laws, all of which
are operating with satisfactory results.
Prison Director Robert T. Devlin dis
cussed the topic of "Prison Reform in
California.". As time goes on the meth
ods of handling criminals change. In the
early days of England nearly every crime
was punishable with death, the idea be
ing to wreak vengeance upon the offender
for his wrongdoing. The State has merely
taken up the battle of the Individual in
his struggles to protect himself against
the aggressions of criminals. Prisons
were .then established, and in order to
prove that these j might not be burden
some upon the State the labor of the con
victs was manipulated for gain. Whether
this was wise, when the question of com
petition is considered, is an. open ques
tion. The speaker then explained the
system employed in the prisons of Cali
fornia. Good conduct and intelligent-la
bor long kept up have great reformatory
effect upon the convicts. The prisoners
have their own band and newspaper, and
the young men are soon actually re
formed. The older criminals, as a rule,
are incorrigibles. The idea of the system
is to punish the criminal, but it remains
to be seen if that principle is the best
that migr* be employed.

described by,- the 'speaker, who said that
their treatment was never the same for
obvious reasons. "The; question of reform
was a complex one which time alone can
solve. â'Â¦ The paroling of . â¢ prisoners was
never abused bythe Prison Directors, and
the prediction that it would depopulate
the prisons was never, realized. The pris
oner . on parole- has' responsibilities which
he respects, and,iiuthÂ«,inajority of cases,
thorough reform was the result. Released
convicts require protection against black
mailers and popular prejudice..The.speak
er hoped this question of. .protection would
be carefully .'considered by the conference.;
He favored the segregation of criminals
so that the novice in' crime might escape
the companionship of the ad#pt . and in
corrigible lawbreaker. '..This would- . re
quire a separate institution to be erected
and maintained by the State.
Â¦. The discussion which followed the ad
dresses was opened by Dr. Samuel H.
Smith, who held that the theory of hered
ity relative to criminals was- absolutely
false. Men and. women are responsible
for their own making if the conditions
surrounding â¢ them are favorable to the
formation of noble characters. Brief re
marks were made by Prison Director Rob

The general eubject'of ."Prison Reform
In California" was discussed at the even
ing session. Robert M. Fitzgerald th-j
chairman of the evening, called the meet
ing to order with 'the statement that.no.
Bef ormation of Criminals.
In the discussion that followed - Mrs.
Blodgett of Holyoke. Mass.; Dr. Â¦ Crab
tree of the Children's Hospital, Dr.; Levy
and Dr. Brown offered suggestions. : Re
fieshments were served by. the ladies -of
the Settlement at. 4 o'clock.
Dr. Willets gave . statements showing
that children cared for at modern hos
pitals thrived infinitely, better than those
cared for at home. Modern science was
doing much along this line and the fu
ture was full of promise. The speaker
urged that children afflicted with pul
monary troubles, cf which there are thou
sands in the poorer quarters of this city,
ought to be cared for by, the State. ., '
Mrs. John F. Merrill, said every city in
the State should have auxiliary hospital
rervlce devoted to the care of children.
At present San Francisco has the only
children's hospital In theState, and appli
cations are daily tewdved from interior
cities to be allowed, tp: send children ".to
the hospital. These are invariably re
fused, as the hospital has all !t can do '.o
accommodate the needy. children of San
Francisco.' â¢ She urged that some steps
toward this end be taken. The idea was
also advanced that the establishment of
a children's emergency hospital to operate
in conjunction with the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to children would
be of immense value to the "community
from the humnnitt-rian standpoint. ,
A well-appointed hospital for children does
much good, a In the Â¦ Eastern . cities, ' where I so
many little ones die from the effects of heat,
the children's hospitals have done much to de
crease the mortality. In connection with the
hospital in this city Is a convalescent or sum
mer home located at | Elmhurst. where sixteen
children from the tuberculosis ward are being
cared for. One of the greatest troubles to
be encountered in. the treatment of such chil
dren iÂ» lack of cleanliness. We found a fam
ily of seven people living in three rooms in a
basement. The filth was Indescribable and all
of the children except one had whooping cough.
There is much work to do among tha children
of the poor. One of the urgent needs is a de
tÂ»ntion hospital for the isolation of contagious
disease." Outdoor life for the treatment of tu
berculosis is indispensable, but there are no
accommodations at the present time for : the
poor. Something . should be done to save the
little ones of the poor. - .
At the opening of the afternoon session
at South Park Settlement Hall the, an
nouncement was made by . Mrs. Merrill
that Mrs. W. B. Harrington, who was to
have delivered an address on the subject,
"Care of the Child in Illness," was un
able to be present, owing- to illness. Dr.
Eva K. Willets of the Children's Hospital
was called upon and spoke .entertainingly
on the subject given. She gave a history
of the founding of children's hospitals in
various cities and "told the methods em
ployed In the care of the .sick. Resuming,
she said:
Care of Child in Illness.
never properly understood, we should come
close to the prevention of Insanity, i The time
Will come when a State like California will
not have more than 1000 Insane. The real
science is the science of prevention.
I don't plead for the reproduction of any
eyetem. Each State is the best Judgts of Its
own needs. If it will learn from the experience
of other communities.
I would have you cultivate hope in your
problems. Out of the disorders we have in
herited we are one day to be delivered. If
there in one doctrine I believe In more than
another it Is the perfectibility . of human na
ture.
. The ideas advanced by Dr. Smith were
discussed briefly by Dr. Stocking of Ag
news Asylum. . He believed that the
acute insane. ought to be segregated and
expressed - regret that the resources for
treating insane persons in the early
stages were lacking. The causes of in
sanity are chiefly heredity,- environment
and mental stress. Educated people rare
ly "become insane,' that affliction being for
the greater part confined to the ignorant
and illiterate. â¢ Â¦; :-.r.-,-J, ?!â¢â¢'Â¦; .'; \"
THE second day's sessions of the
State Conf erence* of Charities and
Corrections opened with fair at
tendance at the Young- Men's
Christian Association yesterday
morning. Considerable interest' In the
day's proceedings was manifested by all
delegates and invited guests.. : , .,
A meeting of the heads of the^various
sections represented at the conference was
had at which the best methods of doing
charity and correctional work were dis
cussed. Those taking part In the dis
-cvssion were Mrs. Edward C. Tallant of
Fanta Barbara, Miss Katherine Felton of
this city. Mrs. John F. Merrill, Miss Cora
Bethel of San Jose. Miss C. A.. Whitney
of Oakland. apd Miss Virginia Fitch.-
The subject of co-operation among the
children's .homes of the State was. con
sidered at length and several valuable
suggestions were offered- At the close of
the discussion Dr. Samuel G. Smith ad
dressed the convention on the topic,
â¢Modern Metho-la of Dealing With tlie
Insane." He objected to the modern
method of herding insane people to
gether, one class being noisy and the
other dirty. He believed that all the
cases of Insanity could be cured if at all
curable within twelve months after treat
ment commenced. It â¢was far more
economical to spend $500 a year to secure
a cure In a case than to expend $200 a
year for twenty years in the treatment
of chronic cases. In conclusion, he said:
Insanity Among Children.
TfcÂ« etudy of the beginning of Insanity In
the child is tven more Important than the
treatment of the acute Insane. Children are
born with unstable, nervous organizations
from diseases in the family as well as from
lnscnity. In the care of nervous children.
I Mr. -Flick of the same club said that the
people I of 'â¢ his ;. district were ready to â¢ do
thes most desperate deeds imaginable to
prevent any further building on the Bite
of the Twenty-sixth-street hospital,

favored the purchase of the unimproved
tract that has been. offered to the city by
the land association Â» In which -he Is Â¦ In

The use of inhalers, douches and sprays is a
nuisance and inconvenience and can in no wise
compare favorably with the- same antlslptlcs
given In tablet form internally, where they can
reach. the stomach and blood and kill catarrh
germs right ' where they are produced. >
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets contain highly con-
centrated antiseptics, Red Gum, Blood Root,
etc., which kill the catarrh germs In the blood
and mucous membrane,' and in this respect are
strictly scientific and modern, ' because all au-
thorities are now agreed that catarrh is a con-
stitutional blood disease, and local applications
can have only a transitory effect. . --. .
The old time treatment of catarrh was In
the form of inhalers, washes, douches, sprays,
etc. Later on Internal remedies were used
with greater success. > but being in liquid or
powder form were Inconvenient to use and like
all -medicines In liquid or powder form losn
their medicinal properties when opened or ex-
posed to the air. r . ' Â¦ -. . ;
Th'e tablet is the Ideal form in which to ad-
minister medicine, but until recently no suc-
cessful catarrh tablet had ever been attempted.
There is ' now, ' however, an excellent, and pala-
table remedy for catarrh' In tablet form, known
as -Stuart's Catarrh . Tablets and sold by drug-
gists, composed of the most recent discoveries
In .medicine for cure of catarVh. and results
from their use have been highly gratifying.- v

of coughing, gagging, expectorating. and sneez-
ing every morning . before I ; could 1 eettle â¢ down
to work, and this condition gradually '.brought
on' catarrh. of stomach, causing ' loss ' of appe-

annoyed. me exceedingly.'; My physician ad-
vised me. to try Stuart's Catarrh Tablets and

Sometimes bad teeth cause Illness, par-
ticularly when they are not fit to masti-
cate food. A man in Ada, Ohio, had all
of his teeth drawn. He was sick with
indigestion and la<:k of vitality and his
teeth were In a bad condition- He ex-
pected, with a new complete set of teeth, 1
to regain his health by thoroughly chew-
Ins his food, but he had an experience
that Is well worth knowing of.
"Instead of Improving-, I continued to
lose strength." he says, "until I was. a
mere moving skeleton* I tried a number
of prepared foods, but none of them
helped mo until I got Grape-Nuts. The
flavor incased my palate at once. 1
soaked the food in cream and get along
with it r.lcely. Within a few days I no-
ticed that I was not so tired and Jaded.
Gradually I grew stronger, bo I left off
all othor foo<!s and took only Grape-
Nuts.
"My old-time vigor came back and in'
two months I gained seventeen^ pounds.
This* was remarkable, for I am of spare
build. Now I sleep and feel wonderfully
well. Â¦
"Inasmuch as I am doing so nicely with-
out teeth. I have concluded to wait until
xny gums have finished shrinking before
harm? a set made. I don't believe I.
could have gone through the drain on" my
system had it not been for Grape-Nuts.
There is no doubt about the life-giving
and nerve-bulldins force of that food. I
talk Grape-Nuts to all of my friends."

Scully ' came- \ Into prominence about
Christmas by swearing out a warrant t or,
the arrest of a business man in the Claus
Spreckels building on the charge of as
sault to murder. He . claimed that the
business man came into' the bar on Christ
mas morning and shoved two revolvers
under his nose, threatening " to blow his
head off because , Scully had ordered â¢ him
out, of- Harney's saloon, where he was a
bartender. The case came up before Judge
Mogran, but Scully subsequently had to
confess that he Â¦ had been romancing, and
it was dismissed. - ' ' â¢_ v
"When Harney opened his saloon at 6
o'clock yesterday morning he discovered
that it had been broken into during his
absence and several bottles of whisky and
about 250 cigars had been stolen. The
till ' had also been forced open ' and all
the money it contained taken. Harney's
rain coat was left on the counter and his
suspicions at once reverted to Scully.
About 7 o'clock Scully called upon Har
ney and wanted to borrow 30 cents to get
his breakfast. Harney kept him In con
versation and quietly notified the South
ern Police Station by telephone that he
had a burglar in his . saloon. Policeman
Laws was sent to the saloon and Harney
asked him to arrest Scully on. the charge
of burglary, explaining that his place had
been entered and the money and articles
stolen. He also pointed to the rain coat
as evidence of Scully's guilt. When
searched Scully had $4 50 in his pockets,
although he had asked for 30 cents from
Harney to buy *hls breakfast. The coat
and '. money . were booked , as evidence,
against, him.' It is .supposed by Harney
and the police that he broke into Harney'a
saloon with the" object of getting articles
to stock hi3 own saloon on City Hall ave
nue. Â¦>â¢â¢"â¢â¢
.Scully applied for a license for a saloon
at 121 City Hall avenue, which was grant
ed by the Police Commissioners last
Wednesday night. He had been for some
time a bartender with Joseph Harney,
saloonkeeper at 1656 Market street, and
Friday during the rain he went to Harney
and asked for the loan of a, rain coat.
He got the coat and returned it during
the afternoon. That nlghfhe called again
and borrowed the rain coat.
. James C. Scully, instead of becoming a
full-fledged saloonkeeper, is booked at the
City Prison on a charge of burglary. The
charge was preferred by Joseph Harney,

Deane Claims California
Oil Deposits Take .'-,.
First Place. ."
A contractor named McMurtry agreed
tc flush the city sewers for $400 per month.
For the last three months of the year
1893 his claim on the treasury was $1200.
McBean also had a contract for taking
care of the city's sewage and his claim
covering the same period as McMurtry's
was for $1225. The amount of money in
the sewage fund at that time was a trifle
over $200.
McBean brought suit, and on appeal to
the Supreme Court his claim was or
dered paid. In January, 1897, McMurtry*
presented an authorized demand for the
amount of his claim. Payment was re
fused, but four months later McBean's
claim was paid -without Its having been
properly authorized by the City Board of
Trustees. McMurtry's claim was assigned
to the Fresno Canal and Irrigation Com
pany, which is the party bringing suit to
recover the disputed $1200.
The Strpreme Court holds that McMur
try shouSd have been paid and is entitled
to recover on the contract.
to Alexander McBean the sum of $1200,
Â¦which rightfully belonged to the Fresno
Canal and Irrigation Company. A deficit
in the city treasury and an order of the
Supreme Court are responsible for Mc-
Kenzie's expensive mistake.

that W. H. McKenzie, who was treasurer
of Fresno in the years 1S93-1894, had paid

Albert J. Lyser, . principal of the John
Swett School, against whom counter
charges of unprofessional conduct were
made by Mrs. Mary C. McKlnney, whom
he charges with Insanity, petitioned the
Board of Education yesterday to bring
his case to an immediate trial. Lyser ex
presses his desire to waive all formalities,
as he preferred to meet the charges at
once. The formality which Lyser seeks
to avoid Is the preliminary Investigation,
which Superintendent of Schools Webster
is at present conducting. On Webster's
report will hinge the ordering of the trial
by the Board of Education. In fact, on
his recommendation the board may take
action forthwith, as it did in the case of
Principal Blanchard, .who, however, was
let off with a reprimand. \.-
The attention of School Director Ronco

to the petition filed by Lyser. Roncovierl

filed, but Mayor Schmltz at once advised
Roncovleri to have the matter proceed in

Deane's general conclusion is that the

make a spectacular * display and produce
an immense quantity of oil, affc really, of
less collective capacity, together with all
other Texas oil properties combined, than

for oil in Los/ Angeles. I This remains the
fact notwithstanding, that the local pro
duction has been increased. The Herald
says: , .
Indeed, In all the oil fields a healthier tone
Is prevailing-, and though Los Angeles was
perhaps, more unfavorably situated Â¦ than any
other oil field there has been a marked change
In the situation during the past two months,
and this in spite of the fact that by the new
wells brought in and the deepening of Â¦ others
the production of the Held- has been largely
increased. Prices for crude oil are 'several
points better than they were a short time ago
and the demand for distillate has been ; such
that this week orders were left temporarily tin-?
filled on account of a shortage. The new
Franklin refinery is about* to; put In several
additional stills, and with the Texas refinery
establishing Itself the outlet for oil' from the

THERE IS A TENDENCY NOWADAYS TO ASCRIBE CASES OF LOST VITAL-
Ity to Uck of nerve force and to *reat ttÂ»em as such, with tonics, electricity and
stimulants, resulting In the most temporary benefit. If at all.
In order to sraln true and clear views ae to the probable Influence of the nerves as
m. factor, I hare made many observation* and examination!) and have supplemented
them by Ions continued and extended experiments. These experiments â¢ have been un-
biased by any theory and have not been prejudiced by any Ideas or views of my own-
ray aim bas not been to theorize, but put a proper Interpretation on the facts carefully
elicited and thÂ« appearances presented. Ae a result of these observations and practical
experience I have been convinced that the nerves play but a subsidiary role In the pro-
Auction of the disorders. It Is very unusual to find any trouble. In an otherwise strong
â¢ man. other than a damaged prostate or deep urethral Inflammation, particularly in
those whose disorders originated In too long- continued and too often .Â¦ related excite-
ment, or the harmful influence exercised by an ill treated contracted disorder and if
exhausted nerve force seemed to be present It is only as a ' concomitant, or perhaps
Â¦we may eay a complication of chronic prostatltls, and disappeared with Its cure

CONTAGIOUS BLOOD POISON.
liyperdcrmtc Injection the Modern Treatment,
After ten years' use of this method we have had no reason to chance; on the con-
trary, our belief increases dally from reports of patients â¢, treated who have married
and suffered no relapse. It oCers the following advantages, viz. : Saves time for the
physician and patient, as well as labor, office visits being rendered Infrequent Be-
sides, little change is necessary in diet or habits of life, the disease Is readily con-
cealed and permanent cure Is effected In a short time/ the stomach is not drugged and
the precise dosare ie obtainable. The expense also is Kreatly reduced. â Â¦
CONTRACTED DISORDERS.
Vnier the treatment pursued before Irrigations were 'established six weeks ; was
deemed the duration of an acute contracted disorder. If It proceeded beyond six weeks
It was considered to have gone into a chronic condition. From statistics compiled from
our practice in the past flvÂ« years, covering over C5O0 cases, we can show that 80 per "
cent of our patient* have recovered in fourteen days or less. It is, therefore, equally
proper to bold that a case not entirely cured within two weeks must be considered a
chronic one, and eome complication has arisen for which the patient should see a spe-
cialist. "We invite free consultation on this subject, and offer an experience of over
twenty years. In fact, we can positively assert that we have never failed to cure In a
einrle instance. :
ALL yARICOCELES SHOULD BE. CURED.
Varicoeele Is an enlargement of the most vital blood vessels in man. The functions
of these veln6 Is to earry off waste, thus enabling. the org-an to receive fresh nutrition
The disease consists of dilatation and local stagnation of; blood.- A* a result we find
sometimes aulte Insensitive organs, which are Ill-fitted to produce their secretion. Va-
ricoeele is a very common disorder. Statistics show that 25 per cent of the male popu-
_ latlon are afflicted with some stage of the disease. We emphatically guarantee to cure
Vartcocele In one we*k at our office or four weeks of home treatment. . We have cured
over 8000 cases, without a. single failure or unpleasant result. Â¦ f ';>.*i&s$*!tof&

of the estate being to get ready money

Mrs. Dr. Merrltt, when asked at the of
fices of the Sutro estate yesterday after
noon concerning the identity of the per
sons who have made the offer of $300,000,
declined to be interviewed. The under

quire a great deal of grading to nt them
for building purposes. The offer has to
be approved by the court before the
transaction can be closed. - This is taken

At the end of a full week of unremittent
effort on the ; part r , of ' the police of '- San
Francisco to establish the identity . of the
murderer of Eleanor j Maud > Fuller Cap
tain Seymour, reluctantly : admitted - last
! night that the mystery' remained as im-
I penetrable as it was on the afternoon the
I body was found. /So .far as the. known
facts are concerned- there remain only
I three lines of investigation that promise
! results. , I.-. < '.' .-V .. : 'V--- - â¢Â¦'-..' - '-
One of these is the bloodstained towel
that was found upon trie body. The towel
is an old one and has the appearance of
having been laundrled a s number of times.
; It was not in the girl's possession when
i she left home and her mother Is positive
it - did not , come : from : her ' house. ; The
police are endeavoring to trace the formei
ownership of the towel , among the lodg
ing-houses of : the downtown district in
hopes that the abiding place of Bennett
or Hawkins during his stay in San Fran
cisco may be discovered. The . pattern of
Â¦the towel is a common one and similar
ones may be found in a hundred rooming
houses apd hotels. Besides, among tne
purchases made by Hawkins at iltzger
ald's second-hand store was a towel _and
in all likelihood this 'is. the one found on
the body of the murdered girl. So the
slender basis on which the detectives are
forced to- pursue their investigations is
Another slight clew which Is being
worked thoroughly is the fact that a bot
tle partly filled with brandy was found
in the room at the time, the body was
discovered. At first it was thought pos
sible that the murdered girl had been
plied with liquor and that the excess^ to
one unused to stimulants had caused her
death. The autopsy destroyed this theory,
as it showed no signs of alcoholic poison
ing. A thorough canvass of every saloon
and shop selling liquor anywhere in the
neighborhood of the house .of _death^ is
being conducted \ by the city detectives
with a view to ascertaining where the
bottle of liquor was bought and; by whom.
Nothing has been developed, -however,
and the bottle may, have, been left by a
former tenant. *,'. - :
Truman Not Yet Located.
1 A vigorous search is being made . for
Charles H. Truman, at one time a mem-,
ber of the Oakland police force and still
a. resident of that place. ' He is now en
gaged in the money-lending business. De
tective Hamill spent two days in Oakland
searching for Truman, and on one of
these occasions was accompanied by. J.
W Krohn, the restaurant-keeper, who, is
able to identify Bennett.; Truman could
not -be located, and up to a late.hour last_
night had not put in an appearance." The
police refuse to say what connection, he
is supposed to have -with the Fuller case,
but from the fact that Krohn, was; asked
to go to Oakland if is supposed .that the
man wanted \ bears a ! resemblance -to the
descriptions given of the murd.erer.
Nothing - new developed- - yesterday.- to.
change ;in , any way :â¢ the ; conclusion . of the
police that the girl.was'murderedon the
night of her disappearance from home.
The envelope bearing a San.-, Francisco
postmark of Januray 21,- which -was found,
in the house.- inclosed a"" circular from -a
furniture house, Â¦ .< and . - was Â¦ doubtless
openedvby some" of the "men. who -gained
admission to the gutter-street' house Â«m
the day the . body : was .: discovered^in
searching for' a clew, to the; identity "<Sf
the corpse. "When it . was | found 9 that â¢ the
inclosure gave no - informations It was,
tossed aside and subsequently to
the Coroner's office with the clothes. ;. The
envelope ,was left lying Â¦ on'-the rfloor^pf .
the house and picked L up. there later. ;^:f^ii
Police Arer Puzzled,."' < s '; J
Â¦â¢ The most puzzling* feature.' of Hhe -, case
to the detectives is the .fact: that-'the girl
telephoned to her home, ; Eaying she .was
in the 1500 block on Geary -street 1 with-the
family of her employer, -that they,, were
nice people and that, she, would .? remain
there all night. The ; message , was -re
ceived by her younger 1 brother, .and
terday he . was submitted ..to ; a {.thorough
questioning by Captain â¢ Seymour -.and
Coroner ' Leland touching this : feature- of
the case. The little fellow was positive
that the voice at the Â¦ other ; end of * the
line was that of his sister and that he
had repeated . the message correctly. . II
left the Instrument to inform his mother,
and when he - returned he :â¢ could get no
response from his : sister. Why did Nora
Fuller utter the falsehood which her
brother is certain he heard? If Bhe. was
under duress :â¢' a single word in the re
ceiver â¢ would have so- alarmed her fam
ily that a search for her would have be
gun at - once and her terrible fate prob
ably been Averted.
Going Over ' the Ground.
Mrs. Fuller and her- three remaining
children -were closeted .for, two hours yes
terday afternoon i with' Captain Seymour,
Coroner Leland â¢ i and Autopsy Surgeon
Bacigalupi. The. entire * ground was gone
over and every detail of Nora Fuller's life
that was known to her. mother or the sur
viving children was repeated; but nothing
important â¢ was developed. : From ; ; the
knowledge Mrs. Fuller had of her daugh-

solely on the insanity dodge: for an ac

was an epileptic and possibly insane. Ex

point, but it carried no weight .with the
jury. The "Count" wept several times

WELCOME GIVEN
WITH ELOQUENCE
Colonel Gives Men the Light of . Sue-
cess and Triumph, and Capacity
for War.
It was an ' unorganized ' military organiza
tion, except In' theory, and it landed In Ma
nila almost' like any -other regiment of "the
National Guard, needing "discipline, needing
encouragement - and catching ! the . light of suc
cess and triumph and the rapacity - for. war,
from its: titular head, the colonel of the regi
ment. Had he been less than be was Its record
would, not be that. which history has made. ,
' . I, - probably with many of you,, was present
at the Precidlo when the citizens of San'Fran
cloco presented to that regiment a standard of
colors, the ensign of the nation,' the flag of the
Elate, and when that long line. came crawling
up the hill and wai formed into ltÂ« three bat
talions en masse.: and the color guard stepped
out with the colonel to take that flag, that em
blem, Â¦Â¦â¢ and bear ; It. - God only knew to Â« what
fate, I wondered If this young officer understood
the fearful responsibility which . was - placed
upon him; if he realized' that he -held 1
in . the - hollow of- his . hand, .as God 'holds'
the waters of the ocean, the life.' health, 'pros
perity and the safe return cf all those -young
five* that were going out under his command.'
I had a little chat .with. him 1 upon the grassy
hlllMde a* they were, waiting, for the formation
of the circle that Â¦ waa to present i that ' flag, t I
talked * with him Â¦ about - his Â¦ condition and . his
feelings, â¢ and I understood. - before I -left him,
that he . deeply appreciated the ' solemn . respon
sibility that the citizens of California had re
posed In him. And that regiment 'had hardly
been a month upon the shores of the Philippines
when It waa called to Â¦ taki_part In the i fight
In the trenches at-Malate;; Etlll later. In the
month of August,-, in the siege and capture of
Manila; and, from that' time on, in the forages
and In the defense of Manila, and asm in, at
the battle of Santa Ana. where hÂ« led.hiscon
querlng host," and scarcely a month later,' when
commenced; that" signal fight* which lasted- for
.fifteen long days that endeil in the triumph -of

I knew Judge Smith when he came to the ;
bar in ltiSl. a young man scarcely 23 years of
age. He had had no extraordinary training
for the profession, but he marched steadily
and faithfully onward, with the respect of the
community and the love and unsullied faith
of a large body of clients, j With that he had
qualities in common- with many other law-'
j-ers of . the . revolutionary time, of the War
of 1812, Â¦ of the Mexican AVar. of the Civil
Wai- â for . many lawyers have , been prominent
as fighters, not merely in the courts, but in
the field '- where blood was '; spilled and where ;
glorious lives* went out in the - defense 'of the
principles of Government. ' Â¦Â¦ Â¦
This young > man. â¢ like many of â¢ those who
had preceded him, took a natural and lively
Interest In the National Guard. . Judge Hunt
has spoken to you of his growth and. progre?3
as a national guardsman, and! you all know
that ' when the formation of our â¢ military sys
tem was changed, under the administration of
Governor Budd. from the old regimental for
mation of ' ten skeleton companies Into tha ex
isting form of the â¢ United States army, Â¦ regi
ments . of three battalions of , 400 men each,
this gentleman was selected by ,- the choice of
all the officers, and with the full approval of
an onlooklng community, to the responsible
position of colonel of that regiment. This was
in 1897. He had had only the theoretical ex
perience which ccmes from such a training as
he had enjoyed, but he' was fortunately sur
rounded ' and helped In the organization and
work of that military organization by a body
of raen in flcld and staff and line officers that
pubaequentliy proved themselves the equal ot
the otflcers, both line and staff, of any vol
unteer regiment that ever - went to the field
in the sen-ice of the country. (Applause.)
l*o one then thought of war. It was a part
of the organization of the Government, and os
such he went to the head of that military
body, discharging such duties . as th& occa
sion called for. ; Hardly a year elapsed when,
a month after the smoke of the cannon of
Dewey had Â¦Â¦ turned over Â¦ a new page in tlie
history of the world, first went out from our
western, shores this First Regiment on the
25th day of May. 1S9S. marching, as you have
been told, through the applaase and through
the drowning tears of mothers and sisters and
sweethearts. The young - boys of that com
mand marched full of enthusiasm, the joy of
the . coming battle ; flashing In every face and
lighting : every eye'. . On the sidewalks and In
the street - were - tearful - eyes and sobs and
cries and the groans at the Â¦parting of loved
ones from those they left behind.' They em
barked upon their transport, and two or three
days -later 'she sailed out through the bay ac
companied by every : vessel that could turn a
whwl. and every â¢ one who could go went out
to bid them a last farewell. . and we hung at
the Golden Gate and saw the good ship disap
pear beyond -th* horizon, and, we turned back
and beseeched Heaven with tearful prayers for
thelÂ» safe return.
5LL honor was paid last evening: to
General James F. Smith, late com
mander of the First California Vol
unteer Infantry, who" was tendered
& banquet at the Palace Hotel by the
citizens of San Francisco and of thÂ«
State at large.
Â¦yThen General Smith returned from, the
Philippines the plan to tender him a ban
quet was postponed, owing to the death
of President McKlnley. In the past week
It Â¦was decided teat the honor 6hould be
given to the distinguished soldier and Jur
ist who has served his country so well to
the Orient and the affair was scheduled
to t^Lke place last evening.
"Within but a fe*r days- notice, the com
mittees in charge of the banquet received
the heartifst suppeft, and the gathering
last night around the festive beard was
one of the. most distinguished ever seen in
this city.
Men prominent In the professions. lead
ers of commerce and finance, the chosen
representatives of the people In local,
State and national government assem
bled to render a tribute to the gallant
soldier who led the sons of the Golden
fc>ta.te on the baÂ£tle!ieldÂ£ of the Philippines
and who has been rewarded by a grateful
country with the important duty of dis
pensing law as a Supreme Court Judge in
The far off island possessions of the re
p u bile. â¢ *55Ssss5K!S!Â£
Tae large banqueting hail of the Palace
Hotel was tastefully decorated with na
'uional flags. The tables were set' In the
shape of a friaijt horseshoe, the "nest of
the evening and the speakers being seated
at the toe. of the shoe, while the rest of
t hose" present were '. seated In "three long
Unes that stretched the length of the vast
halt ,"-.-.; .
The colors of the First California Reg
iment an<?. Signal Corps flags were fes
loctaed gracefully on the walls, while the
tables "were aglow_ with candles and
banked with fragrant flowers.'
Judge F. J. Murasky presided and was
supported on his left by General Smith,
the guest of honor, and the following
gentlemen: Judge John Hunt, toastmas

At 8:15. p-.p. the .guests marched from
the maple (torn to the banquet hall and
for two hours gave attention to the re
past. Durinjr the " feast music was dls-'
coursed by an orchestra, while vocal num
bers -were rendered by the Knickerbocker
Quartet."
It was after 13 o'clock when Judge
Hunt, the toastmaster. rapped for order,
and in a felicitous speech introduced Gen
eral W. H. L. Barnes, who was to deliver
the address of welcome to the guest of
the evening-. Â¦ ,
The speeches of Judge Hunt and Gen
eral Barnes wrre masterly efforts, and
General Smith, in replying, won all hearts
by his modest demeanor and his insist
ence that not to him but to the men who
served under him was due the praise of
the citizens of San Francisco and. Cali
fornia. .
Judge Hunt's Introductory speech was
In part as follows:
Gentlemen, it Is given to few. to attain dis
tinction both fLZ a eoldler and as a lawyer.
The martial qualities of one do not usually
pertain to the other, but to-night we have here
a gueet who. was a valiant soldier, an able
lawyer, an upright Judge. Far be It from me
in hiÂ«. presence to assert that an attorney and
counselor is lacking In j-hysical courage. The
lawyer'" field of battle is a fle'.d of strife and
liot a field of carnage, for. happily, the Jaw
bone is not a <5ead!y weapon. The eminent
lawyer seeks fÂ«ne upon the field of the cloth
of cold : his poorer but perhaps none the lej>s
able brotljpr â¢ etruegles for existence on the
field of the cloth of grub. Our guest was al
ways an able advocate. He wei a successful
one, too. In thU sense, that he never lost a
casÂ», although his client* did.
It. was - In the early hour* of a. morning in

When seen yesterday .at the County Jail
Brockway; said : "I v. will \ prove myself In
nocent of the suspicion that I planned
this robbery. 'My lawyers have Instructed
me to keep silent on the subject."
Â»When first questioned about* the "rob
bery, Brockway informed the â¢ police that
Mrs. t Brockway . was not " his t wife.' i > He
stated .that she was his brother's wife.
This statement has been . proven false.
Brockway.BO Mrs. Harris* attorneys say,
was: married to the woman in.Tacoma, on
November 16, 1898.. Every statement made
by>> Brockway concerning the robbery
tended to divert any suspicion that it, was
a result of a well-laid and neatly execut

Hypnotist's Conflicting Stories.
When Brockway reported the robbery to
the Mission police he gave the name of
Dr. Harrington. Later the -news of the
holdup reached: the ."upper office," and
Captain Seymour detailed Detective Fitz
gerald on the case. The . detective visited
the boarding-house where Brockway lived
and when he asked to see Dr. Harrington
he was informed that nobody bearing that
name, lived there. .Brockway was. finally
discovered | by â¢ the detective, who disbe
lieved his etory from the outset.; Nothing
definite could be proven v against, him,
however. 'â¢ . ;Â¦Â¦â¢'. â¢ Â¦'Â¦ :
; The ; police arrested a laboring man
named John Kelly, who vehemently.pro
tested his innocence. : Brockway sought
to divert suspicion from himself by Iden
tifying Kelly as the man who held up him
and Mrs. Harris.* The hypnotist is alleged
to have exerted; his powers over Mrs.
Harris, and under a spell she, too; identi
fied Kelly. - . i , . Â¦ ... Â¦
She was not as positive, however, about
Kelly being: the man as was Brockway,
and later, upon reflection,' Mrs.. Harris re
fused to prosecute him. . ."-â¢Â¦â¢ ;'- ; .
Captain Seymour liberated Kelly, who
had simply wandered into the vicinity of
the hold-up while on a spree. The: chief
of detectives told 'Mrs; Harris -that cir
cumstances threw suspicion In Brock
way's direction, and ever since, .with the
aid of her lawyer/Judge Magulre, she has
conducted a quiet" investigation, which
has resulted in Brockway's arrest.
Detective Disbelieved Brockway.
tended to do with a man's hat replied
that she wanted it simply to carry out
a -little joke. Shortly before Brockway
and, Mrs. Harris returned and told the
story of having been held up Mrs. Brock
way and Campbell , came back . to the
boarding-house. Mrs. Brockway threw
the hat away and when found later it
bore evidences of having been hastily
crushed and pushed into a pocket."
Very little bad been heard from him since
he left the State.

% Strawberrv this statement we Want you to know that we; mean what "RT h-UOn the advice of his attorneys, D. Ed
ward Collins remained away from the
law office of William Lair Hill, where he
Â¦was to have appeared before Notary Pub
lic Sarah M. Steele this morning to give
his deposition. Attorney Richardson said
Mr. Collins wanted to go, but that he was
not satisfied that the papers summonsing
his client were correct. Then the attor
ney went on to inform the notary and the
attorneys on the other side why they
â¢were not correct. He explained that no
tice had not been served that the deposi
tion would be held, although his client
â¢was served with a subpena, and that be
fore they could proceed five days must
elapse before the proper notice could be
,given.
The new complication grew out of Mri
Collins' visit to the south. Notice was
served on him then, but not a subpena,
because he kept out of the way so that
his plans would not be interfered with.
On his return a few days ago he was
served with a subpena requiring, him to
appear to-day, but another notice was
not served on him. An additional notice
is required, as the first one has expired.
After a discussion as to the convenience
of Mr. Collins the notary and attorneys
agreed upon next Monday at 10 o'clock
as the time for taking the deposition.
"It seems strange that an officer of the
court, whose office is created by the con
stitution, cannot enforce his orders.
There may be no direct delegation of
power to him to punish for contempt, but
it certainly is implied by the fact that the
constitution provides for him. It has the
eflect of permitting an individual to set
u.-:de the constitution of the State.
"Mr. Allen did not give any opinion as
to the power of the Court Commissioner
to inflict punishment, as he confined him
self simply to the legal aspect of the com
mitment. Of course he didn't have to
give an opinion, and so we don't know
what he thinks about it; but we'll find
out."
The District Attorney's opinion was de
livered to the Court Commissioner by
Sheriff Rogers in person at 1 o'clock, at
which time Mr. Daniels was to have been
dealt with for contempt by the Commis
sioner. The Sheriff informed the court
that he could not obey the order to ar
rest Mr. Daniels. Mr. Babcock then re
set the matter until 10 o'clock Monday
morning.
"I will not know what we are going to
do until I consult Mr. Ach, my associate,"
said Attorney J. B. Richardson this after
noon. "It all depends on whether we
think Mr: Allen's view of the legality of
our proceedings is sound.
Mr. Allen's decision, summed up in
lay language, means that the Court
Commissioner and his legal advisers
did not proceed at all in the right
way. The District Attorney discovers
tuat the Court Commissioner, who thinks*
he has been conierred by implication
â¢with the same powers as Superior and
justices' courts, did not follow the pre
fccribed rules of tnose courts in regard to
the person In contempt, as he snouid
have done.
"In courts of record," said the District
Attorney in explanation of his opinion,
"where a person commits contempt thÂ«
Judge proceeds by finding him guilty of
contempt, naming the cause and impos
ing the penalty, if the offense is done in
his presence. In the case of Court Com
missioner Babcock it appears from " the
papers that the defendant left the court
room betore he was found guilty and the
penalty imposed. That puts him. out of
the jurisdiction of the court. It is doubt
lul if they can get Mr. Daniels back into
the jurlsaiction of the court, now that
several days have elapsed since the con
tempt was committed."
The attorneys for Mr. Collins and the
opponents of Mr. Daniels, however, du
not think that the Court Commissioner
has lost jurisdiction over Mr. Daniels and
they are going to proceed to show that
he has not. The mode of proving this
assertion they have not yet determined
upon. It oay. be by writ of mandate or
the institution of entirely new proceed
ings, so that they can get the managing
t- tutor of the Oakland Enquirer into some
kind of a corner.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 15.
District Attorney Allen informed Sheriff
Rogers to-day that he need not arrest G.
B. Daniels, editor of the Oakland En-
Quire'r and party to the Collins-Pardee-
Dalton-Enqutrer suit, on the order of
Court Commissioner Babcock, who de
clared Daniels guilty of contempt for dis
obeying his mandates. The District At
torney finds that the proceedings and pa
pers in the contempt matter are alto
eether wrong, and until the attorneys for
Mr. Collins take some other steps to visit
the wrath of the Commissioner on Mr.
Daniels he will remain out of jail.

Pugillst "Dutch" Thurston had a nar
row escape from being murdered yester
day afternoon at the corner of Sixth and
Minna streets. He became engaged in an
altercation with a man named Robert
Ellis over his 'recent 'fight with Al Nclll,
and Ellis drew a revolver and before any
body could interfere he snapped it three
times In Thurston's fcice. The cartridges
were damaged and failed to -explode, and
because of this fortunate circumstance
Thurston is still able to enter the ring.
The would-be murderer was promptly
knocked down with a well-directed left
from Thurston before he could pull the
trigger, the fourth time. .Realizing that
Ellis, armed as he was,"* would have -A
shade the best of the argument If it went
any further, Thurston walked away from
the scene before the former regained his
feet. -.' {-i .
â¢Thurston* had been down on Sixth street,
where he formerly made his headquarters
when under the management ; of .Alec
Greggalns, to get a watch which he left
to be fixed at Pollsky's Jewelry store. Tha
prize-fighter then dropped .into Dawson's
saloon on Sixth street,' where he met El
lis, who was intoxicated. . The latter and
Thurston had been good ; friends, . but
when Thurston forsook the-management
of Greggalns, Ellis and Thurston had; a
falling out.
While drinking yesterday Ellis became
filled with the fancy that Greggalns .was
angry over Thurston's change of man
agement and he told the pugilist that he
never would have won a fight if ; it were
not for the sage " advice and â¢ the wise
management of his affairs by Greggains.
Thurston resented the remarks of Ellis,
and the latter evidently fearing .that the
pugilist was going to strike him drew his
revolver and pointing It â¢ at Thurston's
head pulled the trigger three times. :

Mrs. Annie Elizabeth Browning, a mil
liner 28 years of age, was found dead in
the Delaware House, at 1137 Market street,
yesterday afternoon. : The woman held a
gas tube in her mouth and death was duo
to asphyxiation. What caused the sui
cide Is a mystery, n - Â¦ .
Mrs. Browning was tha daughter ol
Henry MIdgley, a well-known contractor,
residing at 933 Shotwell street. Ei&ht
years ago she married William Browning,
who is at present connected with a drug
company on Sansome street. Several
years after the marriage disagreements
came, and Mrs. Browning secured a di
vorce five months ago on the ground of
her husband's failure to provide.^ Since
then she has engaged in the millinery
trade, and only three days ago made ar
rangements to secure apartments at 131
Post street, where she intended to con
duct her business.. She .purchased furni
ture and carpets from Mrs. Osterman,
who conducted a manicuring parlor intho
same place, and was well supplied with
money with which to engage in the ven-
U So* far as can be ascertained Mrs.
Browning had no reason to end her life.
She was jovial and apparently had no
troubles. She retired at 8 o'clock Friday
evening and was found dead with the ga3
tube in her mouth late yesterday after
noon. In the room was found $126 50.

The last seen of Morley alive was last
night at 10 o'clock, when he borrowed an
ax from Alanson W. Chute, a carpenter
living at 4202 Lusk street. He told Chuto
then that he needed the ax to drive a
stake, to which ' he was going to tether
the bull In the field near the carpenter's
house.
"I heard - him driving the stake," said
Chute to-day. "I v heard the bull bellow
ing, too, but as I had often heard it be
fore, I did not fear for the safety of Mor
ley. I had heard the bull was dangerous,
but Morley used to lead It about without
seeming to think that he would get hurt.
"I did not pay any more attention to
Morley until" this morning, when I *aw
the bull running and snorting about the
field win the stake dragging after him.
1 thought something might have hap
pened to the man. Pretty soon I saw thÂ»
bull go to the center of the field and paw
something. It soon dawned on me that
it was a man's body. After some trouble
we succeeded in driving the bull away
and removing the body of Morley, for It
was he." _ . A ..
Morley's remains were brought to tha
Morgue, and it was discovered that the
bull's horns had penetrated the body in
two places, with suiflcient depth in each
Instance to cause Instant death. Tlie
\ clothing and flesh were torn In a cruel
manner. The mangling of the body indi
cates that after the animal had knocked
Morley down and impaled him, it had
Jumped upon his prostrate form with its
feet.
The bull was caught after some difll
culty and shot to prevent it from injuring
anybody else. Before it was finally las
sooed it threatened to break down its in
closure and attack some school children
who stood watching, its antics.
Morley's home was at 5*6 Forty-nrtn
street. He conducted a teaming business
and supported himself and wife.

ELECTfilGITY IS NOW THE
REMEDY FOR ALL AIL-
MENTS OF MANKlM
-. Dr.- / McLaughlin Gives Reasons for .the Popur
iarJty of His Methods as Compared
With Tfooss of the Physician.
HOW ELECTiyCITY RESTORES MUSCULAR STRENGTH.
Now that it is generally conceded that "Electricity Is life," -.or the basts
of life, says Dr. McLaughlln, it's a pretty good thing to understand why I
am so successful, and why_ physicians as a rule get so little ' satisfaction
from the use of electricity. , L
In the first place few doctors are experts in electricity. Many are abso-
lutely ignorant of its wonderful possibilities and know nothing of Its appli-
cation.
. ; ' The main reason, however, is the ; inconvenience. A doctor who treats
with electricity has to disrobe his patient. The most he will give Is fifteen
to twenty minutes to a treatment By that time the doctor is tired and the
patient Is Itired^ Say this is done three times a week for a month^ .Think
of the trouble and the expense.; It must cost at least two dollars! a visit,
. $24 a month, .and it takes more time* than iiT required to write a prescrip-
j tlon. The; doctor finds it a burden, and it's hard for the patient to come'
regularly. ' \
â¢ 'Then .the 'resultâ fifteen minutes a day. for three days a week, gives the
patient three hours. of electricity per month, at a cost of $24 at least, while
by my method he gets six hours*, application every night while he sleeps. Â«o
I save him time and money and give him more benefit In one night than he
'gets from a doctor's, treatment In a month. >
... The great New Tork nerve specialist, Hammond, says that electricity
.must be given cdntinuously to get results.
-Professors Beard and Rockwell, authorities on electricity, say that "if
electricity could be given in the form of pills and powders its use would
increase a thousand fold." Bgjj^ , ..
"My system "is the one of giving a mild, continuous current for
every night, as the patient sleeps. .The nervous system drinks this in until
it has become slowly saturated with the life, it has been taken up so
slowly that it remains there and becomes a part of the natural force. This
plain, repeated "nightly for^ twenty or thirty nights, transforms a weak., de-
bilitated system Into, a mine -of energy, /where health Is evident In every
motion. - - : â¢
>*Â¦_â¢Â¦Â¦; 'My appliance is, put on when the patlÂ«nt. retires;, he feels the gentle,
glowing current Instantly, and regulates* It to suit his taste, and then goes
to sleep like a babe and awakens in the morning refreshed and full of 'this
grand energy. This Is repeated nightly until he Is: welL â¢.'". . "_
'_'' I 'treat, my. patients Just as you.would a power engine. If a man is feel-
'ing.out of sorts, "lacking in Ambition and energy; If his nerves are weak,
his stomach giving. him no nourishment; if he has "come and go" pains,
: or 'feels badly ; in any way, â¢ I ; know Â¦ it , is because he Is low In electrical -
vitality. I Increase his electric supply; that sets the human machinery
going again, and away go his troubles.
T The human: body, like the engine, will go right when it has the, power.
I furnish the power. ;
If one Is run down physically I can make'hlm 'as vigorous as he ever
was, in his. life. If he has a pain, I will cure It. and neither trouble will
ever return. Â¦.:'Â¦- "..:-Â¦. J ; ; . '. Â¦;Â¦

Presents Super!) Programme at Met
ropolitan Templeâ Fare-wtell Ap
pearance To-Night.
Josef Hofmann, the renowned pianist,
pave his final matinee recital at Metropol
itan Temple yesterday afternoon In the
presence of a large audience, chiefly com
posed of ladies.
That Hofmann is a master of- technique
â¢vc-as shown by his brilliant rendition of
Bach-D' Albert's "Praeludlum und Fuge
In D Major " which was the first number
of the programme. His execution and
tempo were faultless. -^ â¢-
Mozart's "Rondo A Moll" was given
Â¦with dainty touch and complete expres
sion, while the "Marsch aus den Ruinen
of Beethoven-Rubensteln caught the
house and -was a. skillful display of a
study In octaves.
The "variations serleuses" of Mendels
sohn brought all the light and shade of
Hofmann' s art. The balance of the pro
gramme was as follows: Berceuse, valse
A flat major, valse E minor, by Chopin;
Erlkonig, Morcenstandchen, by Schubert-
Liszt; bacarolle by Rubens tein and rhap
sodle by Liszt.
This evening Hofmann will make his
farewell appearance at the Columbia. The
ater, presenting a choice programme.
Hundreds of poor people of this city
will learn with regret that Dr. Lane is in
a. precarious condition." His philanthropic
deeds were too many to be recorded. Tha
walls of. his office are filled with testimo
nials from organizations that appreciated
his goodness to its members.
His life has been a busy one. His practice
was so great that he found It necessary
to start a hospital. Six years ago he
opened the Lane Hospital, which adjoins
the Cooper Medical College! Up to a few
years ago he devoted a great deal of his
time among the patients, and thousands
owe their lives to his skill. .
There is no physician on this coast who
is better and more widely known than Dr.
Lane. His fame as a surgeon is world
wide. He has done more to advance the
science of surgery than any physician on
this coast. His lectures to the students of
the Cooper Medical College, which he
founded, have been reported to the medi
cal journals of the world and have at
tracted wide attention. Hundreds of lead
ing physicians in this State benefited by
his wisdom and advice, and they revere
him for his kindness and generosity.
Dr. LevI C. Lane, president and profes
sor of surgery at the Cooper Medical Col
lege, is lying dangerously III at his home,
corner of Clay and "Webster streets. For
the past two weeks his condition has been
critical.. Drs. Ellinwood, Rixford, Hirsch
felder. Gibbons and Stillman have been in
attendance and are doing everything In
their power to prolong the distinguished
physician's life.
Dr. Lane is 70 years of age and has been
ailing for the past two years. His
chances for recovery are slight by reason
of his feebleness and advanced age.

NEW SCIENTIFIC PROCESS. Â¦
A Preparation Discovered That Will
Destroy the Dandruff Germ.
For some time It has been known that
dandruff is caused by a germ that*- dig*
tip the scalp into little white flakes, and
by sapping the vitality of the hair at the
root, causes falling hair, and, of course,
finally baldness. For years there have'
been all kinds of hair stimulants and
scalp tonics on the market, but there has
been no ' permanent cure for. dandruff
until the discovery of a preparation
called Newbro's . Herpicide, which de-
ctroys the dandruff germ. Destroy ' the |
cause, the effect will cease to exist. Kill
the dandruff germ . and you'll have " no
dandruff, no Itching scalp, no falling
hair.

NEW YORK. Feb. 15.â An exceedingly er
ratic movement in Metropolitan confused the
speculative interest In to-day** stock . market
and discouraged activity elsewhere In tbe mar
ket. The large scope of the plan announced
and the large resources demanded for carrying
them out caused eome apprehension, as was
eeen by the break in the stock to below 168. after
an opening advance of over a point. This
and the disquietude over the threatened en
forcement of the tax on call loan collaterals
caused some sharp declines In the market, re
cessions reaching a point in some of the promi
nent etocks. There was a rally before the ap
pearance of the bank statement and a renewed
decline after Its appearance. Metropolitan was
then taken vigorously in hand and marked up
to 1% over last night's last price. Amalga
mated Copper also became very strong and
moved up 2%. An oversold short account was
seemingly responsible to a large extent for the
New York Stock Market.

NEW YORK, Feb. 15.â The Financier fays-
The statemftit of the New York Associated
Banks thia week showed a record-breaking
maximum in the items of loans and of de
posits and this, too,, notwithstanding a. loss of
cash. The official return of the cash was
entirely at variance with the estimates based
upon tfce traceable irovements of monÂ«Â»y be
tween the banks and the Treasury and th<Â»
interior, the official statement showing a net
Iofs of ?686,100 made up of a gain of $1 r,10 -
700 in specie and a loss of $2,202,800 in legal
tender*, while the estimated movement shewed
a ealn of *2.(il9, 100 cash. This discrepancy
may be accounted for by an . outward move
ment of legal tenders through the mall to Bos
ton and Philadelphia, which shipments were
not reported by the bank tellers, who confined
their reports to the amount of money which
was delivered to or received from the express
companies. The loans were . expanded . Unt
week by ?13.408.700. This makes a total ex
pansion since the second week in. January of
$67,767,900, and the loans now are 5932 OCW 700
or $13,215,100 greater than the largest amo'unt
of loans on record, which was $918 78tt 600
March 0. 1001. j Deposits were increased' bv
$14,597,100. showing that tho statement i* out
of harmony. The surplus reserve was reduced
$4;335.3'.5 to $13,560,850, or only $708,400 above
the surplus* at the corresponding date a vear
ago. . Then the cash holdings of the banks
wen; $265,684,700, whereas now they are 8^87
380,800. Comparisons of changes in the Item
of loans and of olsh by seven of the "Wall
street banks" show that six out of the number
increased loans by $12,400,000, while one bank
showed a decrease of $1,400,000, maklne a' net
gain of $11,000,000. Two of the six banks" ex
panded loans by ?0,000,000. â¢ ,

gain in caeh was disappointed and the decline
of $026,100 in that item raised the question
whether the return flow of currency to Chi
cago and interior points is imminent. The
market closed quite active and firm at the
rally. On the curb market there were sales
of Metropolitan securities when Issued at 110
and the bid price was advanced to 116. There
were Bales of the subscription rights at 110.
The upward tendency of prices which was
established last week was carried over into
this week and there was an active market
with shifting point* of a sixteenth during the
early part of the week. The selling to realize
profits gained effect during the week, however,
the midweek Interruption of the holiday serv
ing as an encouragement to this, and earlier
gains were in consequence much reduced, while
in a few weak spots wide breaches in values
were made. The operations were evidently in
the hands of speculative pools for the most
part and the discouragement over the unre
sponsive attitude of the general speculative
public had much to do with the culmination
of the rise. There were, however, several
changes In actual conditions that helped to
ward reaction. The proposal of the Brooklyn
Rapid Transit Company to authorize a bond
issue of 915O.4JOO.OCO was a chilling revelation.
Details are lacking as to the portion of this
Issue which it is proposed to float at once and
the purpose to which the proceeds are to b*
put, but the figures are formidable in the sug
gestion of demands upon capital and the fu
ture arrangement for interest. Following upon
the large bond issues for railroads whose
claims to earnings will take precedence of
present stock issues and of new stock issues
which will have equal claims with present
Issues the effect upon speculative opinion waB
disquieting. Last week's great loan expan
sion by the New York banks, which seemed
to begin In the early part of the week, was
gl\-en renewed consideration and revived
anxiety over the rapid expansion of credits.
It is true that the loan expansion of the New
York banks since the first of the year has
been only a little more than half as much as
during the corresponding period of last year,
while the replenishment of reserves has been
much nearer the increase of last year, so that
the present condition of the New York Clear
ing-house banks Is not materially different
from that of last year. The position of the
New York banks as the holders of the greater
part of the ultimate reserve for the whole
country has to be taken into consideration.
New York trust companies have Increased their
loans on collateral to an enormous extent dur
ing the past year, while their reserves are on
deposit with New York banks, except for an
insignificant part, and figure in the reserves
of the banks. Deposits of interior banks in
New York are included In the same way. The
credit expansion the country over has there
fore increased the liability of New York bank
reserves. This gives added influence to any
suggestion of financial trouble in the interior,
even where It Is of email proportions. Money
has continued easy in â¢ Wall street, notwith
standing last week's heavy Inroads upon sur
plus reserves! When the money rate runs up
to attractive figures it is usual for the local
trust companies to -draw on their deposits with
the banks to place loans. When the rate re
cedes to about the figure paid by banks on
deposits the trust companies are likely to call
loans and to deposit with the banks. This
is likely to have the effect of exaggerating the
tendency of the money market toward plethora
or stringency, as the case may be. It is prob
able that loans are being transferred from trust
companies to the banks, thus increasing the
loan accounts of the banks much more than
the actual outstanding credits are increased.
The money market has not had any gold ex
port movement to reckon with this week.
Opinion differs as to whether the export move
ment has ended or is only suspended. The
Bank of England evidently has control of the'
London market and could make an advance In
its rates effective on the money market, but
the Continental demand upon London for gold
has relaxed and Berlin has been a free lender
In London. A continuance of this latter con
dition will preclude the likelihood of further
gold exports frpm here. Some Importance is
attached to the decision to apply the loan tax
of the war revenue law to call loans on stock
operations on margin. The frequent shifting
of 'these loans and of the collateral and the pay
ment of the tax separately on each transaction
would make the cost of such loans prohibi
tory and would cut off the largest part of the
activity In the stock market. Some of the
later selling of stocks is attributed to this
cause. The increased .number of railroads
which are reporting decreases in grots earn
ings compared with last year for the first
week in February has not been without effect
on the market. These decreases are attributed
to the great falling off in the grain movement.
General merchandise traffic is reported to be
well maintained. General conditions of busi
ness are reported. encouraging and the demand
for all grades of Iron and steel products is
phenomenal. The general, undertone of the
market has in consequence shown firmness in
epite of the speculative profit taking.
There has been a broad and active demand
for bonds, which has (tended to bring prices
of many of the newer and lower grade issues
toward the price level of the high-grade In
vestment mortgages.

CHICAGO, Feb. 15.â Higher cables and pre

a slightly better opening .: in wheat, but' the
character of the trading was of the same poor
sort as has been manirested for the past few
weeks.. Most ' of the business was slow and
confined to the local . crowd. . Outsiders kept
out of the market to a marked , degree. A
bullish interpretation', put on the j French Gov
ernment crop report was ' shown in the Paris
cables and engendered still better sentiment
here. There was even Vn attempt to bull the
market on this news. Many views of.'condi
tions, however, worked against the tone of the
market. Northwestern and primary receipts
were liberal, St. Louis was weak and j the
weather was favorable. < . Good ! Jinee were bid

3 arms .of the company's enterprises to the immense coal fields and rich minerals belts of j
n Washington, to the estenslre Iron deposits situate on deep water in British Columbia. H
M to the famous "Marble Bay" mines and limestone quarries on Teiada island. Â«M
Gh SOME OF THE PROPERTIES â The mines bonjht by "The Taeoma Company" are Bj
Kt for tbe most part producing properties. . For illustration, the great "Marble Bay" prop- M
H ' erty on Tesada Island vras being worked In a small way and shipping a thousand tons ijl
0 of ore a month, at a profit of $12,000, when bought. The "Taeoma Company" will 8
Â¦ double and treble and quadruple the output of this great property, and the. profits will I
Bj be increased Â«*orrespondlngly. This "Marble Bay" property includes, besides the mine g
n Itself, a limestone qanrry, lime kilns, townaitc, hotel, etc., the whole embracing 1200 |

I shares for popular subscription at a price consistent with current values. Prices will b* I

Favorites experienced no difficulty in
capturing the first three events, and then
their usefulness ceased. Bullman was the
only rider to pilot two winners during the
afternoon. ; â¢ .
Following the usual custom a hand
some floral horseshoe was placed over the
winning mare's neck and both she and
her rider, were warmly applauded.
Just as on the occasion when Imperious
captured the same handicap two years ago
with a "catch" on his back, there was a
growl registered by many of the Eastern
owners. To obviate this and give good
horses more of a chance, it might be an
excellent plan for the association across
the bay to set the minimum weights for
handicaps at 100 pounds. Any horse that
cannot shoulder such an assignment does
not belong In handicaps and is not enti
tled to any consideration.
1, "Winnie O'Connor had the mount on
Diderot, which horse's price fell from 8
to 5. Scotch Plaid and Corrigan,-- the
Burns & Waterhousa duo, attracted quite
a play at odds of 6 to L There was a
vexatious delay at the post of about twen
ty minutes, caused by the unruly antics
of Greyfeld and the eagerness of the
riders in general to seize any slight ad
vantage. When the barrier was released
all got away to a pretty start . except
Articulate. Â¦ Birkenruth, who seemed half
asleep, stood there as if posing- for a pho
tographer until commanded to take after
the field by Trainer Bob Smith. His case
was thus hopeless. For nearly a mile
Ransch on Corrigan, Winslette astride
Obia, woods with Greyfeld and O'Connor
with the leg up on Diderot, formed the
front division. Eonlc was far back and
Nones still farther away. From the far
turn to the stretch Jackson saved a deal
of ground with Eonlc and was soon hot
on the trail of Corrigan. A furlong from
home the latter was tiring and Eonic as
sumed the lead. Getting anxious Jack
son drew his whip, but soon laid.lt aside
and, the little plater . passed the judges
five : lengths before the tardy-coming
Nones, hard ridden by Nash Turner. Cor
rigan finished third and Black Dick, the
entry of I* V. Bell, a creditable fourth.
The winner's time for the mile .and a
quarter was 2:10^4. Jackson, who rode
Eonic, received 12500, it was said, for his
Skill. .
WHEN last the Burns handi
cap was decided, now fully
one year ago, two great turf
. organizations were battling
for supremacy, and the at
tendance that greeted the winner, The
Fretter. was limited. In defiance cf the
weather signals and with utter indiffer
ence to. the lowering clouds that momen
tarily threatened a renewal of the storm,
more than 5000 enthusiastic .race-goers
passed through the turnstiles , yesterday
at Oakland track. "Tis not every day
a $10,000 stake is decided, and the Burns
handicap proved as great a drawing card
as ever. The track was a perfect sea of
mud, and Articulate was the tip from
early morn until post call. .
Judge of the surprise of the spectators
when Eonlc, a meek, mild-mannered lit
tle mare, carrying 98 pounds, ridden by
Lee Jackson, and a member of one of the
selling plater classes, came splashing
home an easy winner at odds of 12 to 1.
Nones, the top weight, of which so much
was expected on the strength of his fast
workouts, finished . second, and Corrigan,
the Burns & Waterhouse three-year-old,
third. Articulate, the real favorite, with
Birkenruth up, refused to break and was
practically left.
It was about. 20 minutes to 4 o'clock
when the bugle summoned thÂ« twelve
starters to the post. Coupled in the bet
ting, Articulate and Greyfeld had the
call at odds of 2 to 1. Then came .the
Ryan pair, Nones and Obia, with 4 about
them. '

In the open stake Master Rocket has
been Installed favorite at odds of 3 to 1.
Fiery Face is at 4 to 1. The stake is con
sidered to be between these two grey
hounds. The favorites won with few ex
ceptions yesterday. The biggest upset
was the defeat of- Rlenzi by Lady Chi
quita. a 3 to 1 shot.
The day's results, with Judge John
Grace's official scores, follow:
The special stake has an open look for
to-day. Homer Boy, Game Boy, Slsquoc,
Hickory Dick, Freda C, Harlean Gladys
and Wedgewood all figure to have a
chance. Ruby Sankey is in a good posi
tion and. has an outside chance.
Notwithstanding the strong counter at
tractions, there was a good attendance at
Union coursing park yesterday to witness
the decision of the first round In the two
stakes. The hares continued strong, a
number of long courses resulting.

The New Idria Quicksilver Mining Com
pany In .San Benito County produced 4800
flasks of quicksilver last year, or 367,200
pounds. The total cash disbursements
Â¦were $169,855 66, of which amount the pay
roll was represented by $101,480 66. Tho
ore rained and treated amounted to 31.S60
tons. The cost of ore reduction per ton
was 64 cents and the cost per ton of min
ing was $1 82, including development work.
There is considerable stir in . quicksilver
properties In Sah Luis Oblspo County. A
group of quicksaver claims near Adelaide
has been sold t* Paso Robles parties by
L. J. Slnnard. Eighty acres of cinnabar
bearing land have been sold by E. Ladner
of Paso Robles. the tract, lying twelve
miles west from Paso Robles, for $10,000
to Los Angeles parties, - who propose to
erect a reduction plant very soon. The
Klau mines near Paso Robles are credit
ed with producing about 200 flasks of
quicksilver per month. A furnace will'
soon be completed at the Oceanic mine
near Cambria.

Though the total rainfall to date along the
mother lode Is probably not over half what it
was a year ago or anywhere near the average,
the water has been received at Intervals Instead
of all at once, and the work on the mines is
going ahead as usual. . Years ago such a dry
year would have caused considerable inconven
ience, but now there are so many reservoirs
and such extensive ditch systems that the run
for the season will probably be earned out
even should there be light rains from now on.
Where almost twenty-six inches of water has
been received heretofore, only about thirteen
inches have fallen. . .' .Â¦-.".
There is a general revival of. interest
in mining properties in Nevada County.
The Mining and Scientific Press, summar
izing the information received from Its
correspondents and from other sources,
says:
Nevada County Is already showing the effect
of thÂ« Increased attention being given to gold
mining in the last month or two. For Bonne
years there has been no gain in the extent
oi or production from gold mining. If any
thing, the impression from a casual investiga
tion would be that the number 'of the mints
and their output was diminishing, some what.
Lately, however, there has been a notable . in
crease in new enterprises and "In reopening old
mines. Grass Valley and Nevada City districts,
while easily first in the extent of this favorable
change, have no exclusive possession of It. . . -
The old camps of Rough and Ready, French
Corral. North Bloomfield, Washington an<t
Meadow Lake, that in the lapse of years had
become all but abandoned, have taken on a
new period of life with the reopening of the
old mines. As mines are exploited to-day these
old mines are In Â¦ their infancy. Some of the
supposed worked-out properties are found with
barely prospected cropplngs, though mills built
on them In the early hurry days of California
mining long since disappeared even as streaks
of rust. There is nothing but what is good to
be said of the present expanding gold mining
Industry of Nevada County. . X", - .
The Redding Searchlight hears that the
<Vynn- property on Clear Creek, Shasta
County, has been sold to a company for
dredging. The land is on a high fiat op
posite Horsetown. The tract has long
been considered quite rich in gold, but it
Is so situated as to be inaccessible to or
dinary methods of working. Water was
once raised to it from Clear Creek for
hydrau licking, and Chinamen have at
other times tried to work it, but the at
tempts were not successful.
The Stockton Independent says of the
water supply of the season on the mother
lode:
Nevada County Booming*
The disturbed condition of the copper
market is still a factor in diverting at
tention somewhat from the red metal to
gold. What Is the real purpose of the
parties who have been manipulating cop
per is not clearly understood, but it. is
evident that the great men In, the copper
Industry are not in line to permanently
depress the wares in which they deal.
There are rumors in Shasta County of a
consolidation of the copper properties in
that section, -but whether this has any
relation to the market can only be con
jectured.
In this State the trend toward gold
properties is extensive enough to attract
attention abroad. Gold is f not subject to
fluctuations such as have befallen copper
In the past few months. The industry, of
gold mining in California is in fine shape,
as all reports indicate. The water supply
in the mountains, while it has not been
as large as usual, has been distributed
favorably in point of time, and the facili
ties that the miners have provided for
themselves for, the storing and handling
of water- have made the shortage much
less serious than it would have been a
few. years ago. The notes of the week
Indicate activity in all directions. ,~///*:
