notables. The Secretary of State and his
daughter and the bridesmaids arrived Just
before the noon hour. While waiting Miss
Hay recognized in the crowd several old
friends. She nodded to them cheerily.
The handsome church had .been trans
formed into a- bower -of Easter lilies
against a background of green. .The wali
back of the pulpit was formed into a re
redos of giant palms, southern smtlax and
ferns', in the center, of which was a huge
cluster of lilies tied with loops of broad
white satin ribbons, blossoms radiating' In
every direction. Around the church walls
were festoons of smllax caught In gar
lands by bows and loops of ribbons. The
large pillars .'were twined with smiiax,
the capital pillars were a mass of lilies,
and clusters of the same were placed at
intervals .~ around them. The pews 'Â¦'Â¦ re
served for the family and near friends
and distinguished guests were looped off
by. ribbons, and, clusters of the blossoms
were massed against the pew ends. Per
haps the' most, beautiful and unique fea
ture was r the decorative scheme of ; the
center aisle. A large cluster of lilies was
fastened at ! the end of every pew, placed
at various distances from the floor, gradu
ating from 'a height: of three feet at- the
pulpit to ; the back of the church; where
the .flowers stood six or seven feet high.
This formed an aisle of. flowers, down
which the bridal procession passed.
A few weeks' ago the Earl of Roslyn
started in to try his luck against the
Monte Carlo tables on a system devised
by himself, j He worked out his scheme
with the usual elaborate mathematical
calculations of the "system" monger, and
to make sure of its Infallibility went so
far as' to hire a. croupier from the Ostend
gaming tables 1 /with whom, in prolonged
seances in London, he tested It In prac
tice. It was said that' he then formed a
syndicate to provide the capital for mak
ing war upon the Monte Carlo table bank
ers. His operations created a good deal
of interest, being witnessed, among oth
ers, by Chauncey M. Depew'and Charles
M. Schwab.
LONDON. Feb. 6.â Word reached Lon
don to-day that Lord Roslyn's system at
Monte Carlo had collapsed and that he is
a heavy loser. A friend of his was start-
Ing for Monte Carlo to play the system

proudest day in the life of the Hay coach
man" when he drove the dashing team of
the Secretary of State up to the house.
He wore a big white rose in his lapel and
a big white cockade on his hat. The
bridles of the horses were tricked out
with white rosettes and long white rib
bons fluttered from the whip. The bride
appeared in a heavy wrap' and was es
corted to the carriage by her father. Her
mother had gone'on to the church in ad

and were at once escorted to a front pew.
The President stepped back and insisted
on his wife and daughter being first taken
to their places. Mrs." Hay came in a few

,\V., WASHINGTON, Feb." 6.-MIS3
Helen Hay's wedding bells rang
out to-day beneath a cloudless
sky. The gifted daughter of the
Secretary of State was united in marriage
to Payne Whitney under circumstances
Â¦which "left nothing to be desired In the
happiest day in the life of a charming
bride.
' The ceremony was performed in the
presence of a company distinguished â¢ at
home and abroad. It was a wedding al
most international in its character. At
the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant,
where the knot was tied, you could not
move without jostling ' an Embassador or
a Cabinet Minister or former Cabinet
Minister. Th*e President . of the United
States and his family occupied a front
pew. The bride' was given away by her
father, Secretary of State and former
Embassador to the court of St. Â¦ James.
The father of the groom, William C.
Whitney, maker of Presidents, maker of
fortunes for his friends and Secretary of
the Navy in the Cabinet of Cleveland,
looked beamingly on as the bride and
groom stood at the altar.
It seemed that a handsomer couple nev
er clasped hands. The bride Is one of the
prettiest girls ' of Washington, and she
looked perfectly radiant to-day. The
groom, tall, broad-shouldered and ath
letic, seemed to be a sample of perfect
young American manhood.

By this stroke the Pacific Coast Com
pany, controlled by Hill, became master
of the transportation business to South
eastern Alaska. In a word the two present
lines to Southeastern Alaska are con
trolled by the Hill family and their as
sociates. It is a noticeable fact that the
lines being operated by the Puget Sound
Navigation Company do not parallel a
single rail line of the Great Northern Rail
way. The mest Important Sound steamer
route out of Tacoma Is that to Belling
ham Bay and the new company has not
touched this route. Its steamers run to
Port Townsend. Port Angeles, Neah Bay
and down-Sound islands. The routes of
the new steamers to be built are not yet
announced.
New Steamers Are Proposed.
It was President Mellen's intention to
operate both steamship lines with Dod
vrell & Co. as general agents and the Ori
ental line is being so operated. It has
become positively known that President
Mellen was in" Tacoma arranging with
Frederick DodweU for continued operation
of the Washington and Alaska Company
when telegrams were received from New
York announcing that the Northern Pa
cific directors had decided to sell the com
pany's steamers to the Pacific Coast Com
pany and instructing President Mellen to
immediately negotiate the sale with Presi
dent Farrell. This was done. President
Mellen declared at that time that the ac
tion In New York was the direct result
of President Hill's influence with the
Northern Pacific board.

previous the sale of the Northern Pacific
Steamship Company and Washington and
Alaska Steamship Company to the North
ern Pacific Railway through J. P. Morgan
& Co. had been announced.
The connection between the Oakes and
Hill families is believed to explain thia
harmonious action. A few weeks ago
Louis Hill, a. son of Hill,, was
married in New York to Miss Taylor of
St. Paul, a sister of Mrs. Walter Oakes.
Ten days ago one of the finest private
cars owned by the Hill family was sent
from St. Paul for the special use of Oakea
and his family in going to St. Paul and
New York, where they are now. Oakes'

WASHINGTON; Feb. 6.-The Industrial
Commission has submitted its final report
to Congress. It is a document of more
than 1000 printed pages. The first part,
which has been made public, deals with
the progress of the nationâ agriculture,
mining and transportation. Recommenda
tions are made on the subjects of transr
portation and agriculture. The . commis
sion advises as to transportation:
That tha policy of Governmental supervision
and coatrol of railroads, as originally laid down
in the SeiRtte committee report of 168t> an<l
embodied the following year into the interstate
ejmmuve act, bs revised and strengthened;
that the authority of the Interstate Commerc*
Commission, necessary for the adequate pro
tection of snippers and clearly intenaed by the
framers of. the law. be restored and that the
powers and functions of the commission be en
larged practically as contemplated in the so
caaed Culiom bill, except as to authority to
prepare and enforce a uniform classification. ,
Â£uch legislation should provide: For more
stringent regulation of the conditions under
which freight and passenger tariffs are pub
lished and died. - .
No rate of classification ought to be changed
without at least sixty days' notice to shippers,
unless specifically authorized by the Interstate
Commerce Commission.
That strict adherence to tariffs be required
and rebates or discrimination prevented by an
increase of tbe penalties.
That the long and short haul clause In section
four of the act of 1SS7 be strengthened and
rigidly enforced, unless the carriers shall be
released by special order of the Interstate Com
merce Commission.
For the definite grant of power to the Inter
state Commerce Commission, never on its own
initiative but only. on formal complaint, to
pass upon the reasonableness of freight and
l>assenger rates or charges; also the definite
grant of power to declare given rates unreason
able as at present, together with power to pre
scribe reasonable rates in substitution.
For early hearings upon complaints and for
prompt decision by the commission, the pur
pose being to obviate intolerable delays.
For a specific grant of power to the Inter
state Commerce Commission over classification,
both as to items and grouping.
Coupled with this, however, we dissent from
the section of the to-called Cullom bill re
quiring the Interstate Commerce Commission
within a certain period to promulgate a uniform
classification for the United States.
For the establishment of a permanent corps
of expert auditors who shall have authority
under the supervision of the Interstate Com
merce Commission to examine periodically the
accounts of all railroad companies whether
operating or financial in their nature.
That violations of the act respecting the
keeping of annual reports by carriers should be
made misdemeanors and promptness in making
cuch returns should be required.
That, to further the eSectiveness of the com
mission, its membership should be directly rep
resentative of the interests concerned, in the
persons of shippers or business men. tratnc
experts (rail and water) and men of legal
training, and the number of members should
Vnat legislation analagous to the
Â¦watering statutes of Massachusetts be enacted
by the several States. ..-Â¦,Â» .. Â».
Thdt railroad companies be prohibited by
law from making lower freight rates upon im
ports billed to the Interior of this country, on
the connection with, ocean trafS? 0 "* 00^ Â«r
otherwise, than are made on similar articles
from the seaboard to the Interior, or than are
made from one inland point to another, when
the distance is not greater. . :
Prefacing Its recommendations regard-
Ing agriculture the commission says that
Agriculture has derived more benefit
from the establishment of the Department
'of Agriculture and from tis administra
tive work than from any other Federal
legislation." . ,,
ft makes the following recommendations
on this subject: . â¢ .
That the Secretary of Agriculture be given

That adequate legislation be enacted by the
several States, where needed, to control such

Question of
Mrs. W. W. Stilson Of Los Angeles dls.
cussed the question of reorganization.
A new amendment proviaes "that the
executive board at its first' meeting fol
lowing the annual meeting-shall appoint
an executive committee of. three, of whom
the president shall be chairman, to trans
act routine business or to act in emergen
cies." Â¦ ; ' y - .
Another amendment provides that "In
each district one delegate from every
club shall constitute the electors for the
member of nominating, committee to
serve said district. The nominating com
mittee shall meet at the time and place
of the annual convention and prepare a
list of nominees. Electors may scratch
the ticket and write other names on the
ballot." .
The basis of representation was fixed
at two delegates from .each club of 100
members or less*, one- of whom shall be
elected and the other to be the president,
or her appointee. For each additional
hundred members one additional delegate
is to be selected, but no club shall have
to exceed six delegates.
Several changes â¢ were made- in the by
laws. -At the annual meeting the district
vice presidents shall report for all clubs
in their district, instead of having tue
club presidents appear before the conven
tion. The date for. the annual election of
officers of clubs affiliated with the State
Federation was fixed to be held between
the time following the close of the con
vention of the State Federation and May
30. A long discussion ensued over .an
amendment- proposing to reduce the per
capita tax from 10 cents to 5. It was
then proposed to let the individual clubs
take care of their dues to. the General
Federation. The proposition to amend
was lost, and the- per capita tax remains
as before. â¢ . â¢ â¢,
Another amendment reduced ? the â¢ term
of the officers in accordance with the ac
tion providing for the Jiolding of an 'an
nual convention. No officer shall be eligi
ble to the same- general office for more
than two consecutive terms. The title of
the "State corresponding secretary, of th<>
General Federation" was changed to read
"State chairman of correspondence." - i .
Consideration of amendments to the
constitution followed the report of the
nominating committee. The first'amend
ment adopted 'was changing the conven
tion of thei^tate- Federation from "bien
nial to annual. A; second amendment re
duced the time in which i newly organ
ized clubs may be admitted to the-feder
ation from one year to six months. :
Mrs. S. Mitchell of the Kattenach Club
of Visalia and Mrs. K. M. Atkinson of
the California Club were admitted as ad
ditional delegates in the report of the
committee on credentials. ..
It -was announced that the pol's will be
open from 10 a. m. to 12:30 p.'m. and later
from 1 p. m. to one-half hour after the
closing of the convention. Mrs. J. N.

- A. large audience was present anticipat
ing an exciting debate and the noon re
cess hour passed while the ' discussion
was on. Mrs. Burdette called for the
regular order of business and it was dis->
patched quickly. . . . i
Mrs. Florence C. Porter of Los Angeles
read the report of the nominating com
mittee. The report referred to the diffi
culty of securing a candidate for presi
dent, owing to the refusal of Mrs. Lovell
White. The choice then unanimously fell
upon Mrs. Kate Bulkley of the Ebell Club
of Oakland. At her request Mrs. J. XV.
Orr of the California Club was named for
corresponding secretary, for which posi
tion Mrs. Bulkley was originally nomin
ated.' The ticket in full was as follows:
It wap.the aim of those! in favor of the
State plan to secure the passage of a
resolution instructing the delegates Â£c be
elected to-day to vcte for. the State fed
eration plan. Two resolutions to this ef
fect were offered during the day, but
President Burdette ruled both out. No
test of the actual strength of the oppos
ing forces was possible under these-rut
ings. â¢
One plan for the reorganization of the
General Federation leans toward organr
laation by State lines, that is, State fed
erations carry with them the clubs af
filiated therewith and elect delegated In
proportion to numbers. Each State fed
eration, in this way, has the right to act
upon the qualifications of membership of
its own body, and to send Tsuch delegates
as it may select. \ The other plan is the
admission of individual clubs, the General
Federation alone passing upon the ap
plication of the club. The advocates of
the admission of clubs of colored wom-jri
favor the State plan, as some States -have
already declared upon this question. â '
b> -i sa VERY effort was made yesterday
J? at the convention of. the Calif or-
nia Federation of Women's Clubs,
in session at Golden Gate Hall,
to secure recognition of the clubs
of colored women by the General Federa
tion, which meets in Los 'Angeles in May.
but the advocates of the measure to in
struct the delegates upon the line whicti
will permit this admission though persist
ent was not successful. -

He arrived there January 5 with three

deer tracks dn the beach Murphy went
ashore in a small boat with a rifle* hoping
to secure a supply of fresh meat. In
tracking the deer through the woods he
became lost, and darkness found him alon-j
in the woods, unable to retrace his steps.
He heard shots tired from the sloop, but
could not determine their direction- He
fired in response, but a stiff breeze was
blowing in-shore and his companions did
not hear him. He finally reached the
beach and tramped for miles up and
down, nnally tailing unconsaoos at tn>j

question, sidetracked in Milwaukee, comes up
in Los Angeles In May and promises' to take

In this case there is no question of social
or Intellectual differences. It is a question
of racial prejudice. The opposition , comes
from that part of the country where a colored
man or wo-nan is a rarity. When a great fra

without anjr' trouble. There have been too
many extraneous matters brought In. .
There is too much driftwood brought in.
There -is -no- philanthropy. The General Fed

thing, to do. is look. over. the situation. Clubs
that would be the least affected by this ques

CONSTANTINOPLE. Feb. 6.â The
Sultan's brother-in-law, Damad
Mahmud Pasha, has been sen
tenced to death. Mahmud has
long been prominent in the Young
Turk movement and was recently ex
pelled from Greece at the behest of the
Sultan. Mahraud Â¦went- to Rome and the
Sultan requested his expulsion from Italy.
It was refused, but Mahmud proceeded
to Paris, where he remains in safety. All
the Sultan's blandishments failed, to In
duce him to return to Constantinople, and
the criminal court was instructed to Issue
a warrant for Mahmud's arrest and to try
the fugitive by default, with the result
that he was condemned .to death.

his return to Constantinople on â¢ the

"Every other: large city with a water
front has one or; more launches or other
craft and the front. is regularly and sys
tematically patrolled. In consequence the
operations of bay or river pirates are ren
dered as difficult as the work of burglars
elsewhere. Here these .'rats' I can do . their
work with slight danger of being detected.
"My predecessors haVe urged the neces
sity of a launch 'for hay. patrol, but year
after year provision for it has been omit
ted from the "tax levy. I shall strongly
urge the purchase I and maintenance of a
patrol boat and shall place it In my esti
mate of expenses of the department when
the time comes." ... ' : '
Chief of Police Wlttman said last nigiit
that it was only another case demonstrat
ing the ,- necessity of a police . boat -for
patrolling the-bay.- He said: . ' .v
.The burglars, had evidently worked frcm
a boat, sawing a large hole through : the
floor. In all the thieves got away with
twenty-seven boxes 'of cigars," ten "boxes
of tobacco, a jar of snuff, 500 cigars not in
boxes and a large quantity of cigarettes.
.Not the slightest .clew was left behind
by the burglars and the. detective put
upon the case by Captain Seymour has
nothing to work on in running down the
thieves. Unless they betray ; themselves
in disposing of the booty they are likely
to escape punishment. " â¢
Another water-front burglary in which
the thieves worked with impunity as a
result of the police department's lack of
a patrol boat, \ was committed TuesdÂ«y
night. . The cigar store in front of | the
Castle saloon on East street, near Folsom,

murder of John Doster three weeks ago,
was 4aken from jail at Lynchburg last
night and hanged by a mob. Whittaker's
case was called in court yesterday and
continued.
After the assault Brown, who was aged
19, was arrested and this morning he was
taken to the home, of the victim, who
lully identified him. To make the identi
fication doubly sure, the negro was taken
to the scene of the assault in charge of
officers, followed by a mob of 200 armed
men, determined that he should not be
transferred to Lexington. The mob fol
lowed closely behind the carriage and was
reinforced by many men on the way.
When nearing the Courthouse the car
riage was suddenly surrounded and the
mob dragged the negro from the authori
ties, who made a strong resistance.
Brown was hurried to the Courthouse
yard, where a rope was quickly put
around his neck and he was dragged up
over the limb of a tree. He was strangled
to death. The whole city turned out to
witness the lynching.
NICHOLASVILLE.^Ky,, Feb. 6.â Tom
Brown, the negro who assaulted Miss
Delia Powell yesterday, was taken .from

During the night the mob made repeated
attempts to get the prisoner, but failed.
Miss Powell is a student at the Jessa
mine Institute in this city and lives at
her brother's % home, about three miles
north. Last evening she started home in
company with the Misses Braden, who
also live out of town and attend school
here.
Leaving the Braden girls at their home,
Miss Powell continued on foot on her
way to her brother's, about half a mile
farther on.

She was swept past Wenatchee and had
gone some distance further down the
river when Captain Cumins, realizing
that destruction was imminent, began
looking for something to use as an anchor.
His eye lighted upon a redhot coal stove
in the cabin, the stove being full of coal,
as the weather was away below zero, f
Seizing the chains he threw them
around the stove and quickly attached the
cable. The stove was then, dumped over
board for anchorage purposes. It held
firm and the boat was stopped until a

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
Ray Sutton Garlick, a well-dressed
young man who lately, arrived here from
Tacoma, tried to pass' himself on% as the
nephew of William'' Alvord, the banker
and .ex-Police Commissioner,' yesterday
and is now repenting his folly in a cold
cell in the City Prison. On the prison
blotter, appeared' his name, with a charge
of : forgery written opposite it. : t Garlick,
who .says his father is president of the
Puget Sound Savings Bank, at Tacoma,'
claims that a depleted purse impelled him
to commit the crime, but the police think
that Be has a penchant for doing such
things and has been in trouble before.
Since his arrival here Garlick has been
stopping at the Palace Hotel. Yesterday
afternoon' he telephoned to the W. K.
Vanderslice Company's jewelry store on
Sutter street /and Â¦ after announcing: that
he was the nephew of Mr. Alvord said
that the banker had given him a check
with which he . was to purchase some
jewelry for him./ :
He was told that Mr. : Alvord' s check
would be honored and that the jewelry
company would be glad to make the ac
quaintance of his nephew. ;
While the young man wfcs on his. way
to the store one of the members of the
company telephoned to Mr. Alvord and
asked him if he had given his nephew a
check with which to purchase jewelry for
him. -
"My nephew!" exclaimed- the banker
over the phone;* "I haven't any nephew,
and did not give anybody a check with
which to buy jewelry for me." \ Â¦ *.
Â¦ Satisfied that the fellow who had tele
phoned to him was a fraud, the manager
of the jewelry store summoned Police Of
ficer Chapin and had him remain in a
convenient place until- the forger showed
up. A few minutes later Garlick, dressed
in the latest fashion and his face
wreathed in smiles, appeared and after
introducing himself as "Mr. Ray Sutton
of New Orleans, .nephew of Mr. Alvord,
banker and capitalist," asked to be shown
"fc. watch and a diamond ring.
Thanks Jeweler for Kindness.
After- selecting the timepiece and a ring
with two small diamonds, the stranger
gave the clerk a check for $100. drawn on
the California bank and purporting to
have been signed by William Alvord,

get a good case against him, the cashier,
after pretending that the check was gen
uine, gave Garlick $20, which with the
price of the jewelry made up the amount"
of the check: -
With many promises of returning and
buying more jewelry the youthful forger
started to leave the store and was placed
under arrest by the policeman.
He was then taken to the City Prison
and charged with forgery. In his pockets
were found six 'other checks bearing the
name of the banker and ranging in
amounts from $25 -to $100. . <Â¦
To Detectives Harper and Armstrong
Garlick said that he was penniless, and
as he was a stranger in the city he con
ceived the scheme Â«f forging tl\e name
of Mr. Alvord to the checks which were
found in his possession, expecting that he
would have little trouble in passing them.
In his room in the Palace Hotel the de
tectives found a diary showing that he
bad been in Oregon and Washington and
that ; he arrived in this city last Sunday.
They, also . discovered, a receipt, for $11
made out in the name of R. S. Â¦ Garlick
from the Dauntless Lodge, â¢' Independent
Order of Good Templars of Seattle.

intended to swindle: .

It was learned late last night Ahat Gar
lick came here a few days ago from his
home in Tacoma, ! intending to go direct
from here to Chicago, where his father
had arranged for him to take a course at
the University of Chicago. Here he met a
former companion, Olango G. Moffit, of
2605 Howard street. Moffit's father is a
retired; shipping man and at one time the
family lived on the sound. Young Moffit
said last night that he did not know that
Garlick's funds were low, but he knew
that the' youth had 'spent considerable
money. "When Garlick left his home he
was plentifully supplied with funds, but
a^fast pace and riotous living soon con
sumed his bankroll.

SEATTLE, Feb. 6.â The steamer Jeanie
anived from Illiamna to-day with thirty
six passengers. Tuesday night, in John
son Strait, north of Seymour Narrows,
the Jeanie saw a steam vessel, all lighted
up and at anchor. She was presumably
a British craft north bound.
No news was received ' of the British
survey steamer Egeria, which is also en
gaged in the search for the missing Con
dor, nor was she reported at any port of
call along- the coast. It is thought that
she is standing out to sea and scouring
the waters off the entrance to the straits.,
The lifeboat of the Condor which was
found by the Ahousset Indians on Janu
ary 6, with the gripes still on it and
everything pointing to the fact that it
had been swept from the davits, is 'on
board the American cutter Grant, ac
cording to advices received from Ahous*
set by the Queen City. The Grant called
at the west port shortly after the Queen
City resorted the find on her last trip
and secured the boat from the Indians-.
The Grant then left for the northwest
coast, making calls at a number of^ ports.
She is expected to arrive at any tffne on
her way back from her cruise. \
It was about thirty or forty feet long
and was either scraped bright or painted
a light yellow. It was easily seen from
the Queen City, and that vessel's officers
say that there were no heel ropes at
tached, they having evidently been car
ried avray. In color, size and generally
the description might fit the gear pf a
Â¦warship. Whether the Condor carried
such studding-sail booms i could not be
learned to-night.
When steaming down to Victoria from
Alberni the Queen City passed a studding
sail boom floating about four miles out at
sea and about six miles or thereabouts to
the south of Cape Beale, where the light
house marks the entrance to Barkley
Sound. As there are very few sailing
craft, or other vessels, for that matter,
other than the warships which carry stud
ding-sail booms among their gear the
trend of opinion is that the floating stud
ding-sail boom which was belns: tossed
shoreward in the heavy seas of this after
noon came from the long-missing Condor.
â¢ VICTORIA. B. C, Feb. 6.â Still the sea
gives up mute evidences of disaster to
the missing warship Condor, which sailed
from EsQuimalt on December t in .the
face of that dread December gale with
140 souls on board. A lifeboat was first
found on Ahousset, then another boat
was sighted at the entrance to the straits,
yesterday the lid of a provision box with
the rim' of a sailor's cap drifted on a
beach near Victoria, and to-night the
steamer Queen City returned from the
west coast of Vancouver Island with news
of further wreckage, believed to be from
the missing Condor, although it was im
possible to identify it.

the immorality among the Chinese women
brought in prior to the exclusion laws.

WASHINGTON. Feb. fi.-James D.

On the otner side, he said, were the Pa

and returned missionaries, who urged no
public reason for the admission of Chi

ANGRY CITIZENS
LYNCH A NEGRO
CHICAGO, Feb. 6.â Adam Worth, alias
Henry J.' Raymond, -known as the "Na
poleon of crime," is dead in Londdn. and
with the announcement of his death to
day all the details of the recovery of the
celebrated Gainsborough picture were
made â¢ public v in Chicago. , When the
famous picture was restored to its owner
Jn Chicago last April there were many
surmises as to the medium of its return.
William A. Pinkerton, who made
formal announcement of the recovery oi
the painting, refused to confirm or deny
any of the stories. Now that Worth is
dead Pinkerton can speak. Worth gave
him written permission to reveal the
Gainsborough secret after his death.
Wrapped in oilcloth the canvas was
handed over to C. Moreland Agnew^ona
morning last April in Chicago by Worth
who twenty-five years before had cut
the painting from its frame in the Agnew
galleries in London.
The return of the painting took place
in Pinkerton' s private office. The owner
of the picture hurried back to London for
fear the United States authorities would
demand a customs duty on^ the work
which had been secreted in this country
for fifteen years. ' â¢ ;
It was while in London that Worth con
ceived the idea of carrying off the
Gainsborough picture. His first . plan
was to rob the Royal Academy of its art
treasures. Then he changed his mind
and directed Ihis attention to the Gains
borough painting. Assisted-by his part
ner, he climbed into the Agnew galleries
one night, cut the painting from its can
vas and carried it away. Â¦ - - Â¦
Worth owned a steam yacht and the
canvas was taken aboard and concealed
there until he sold the vessel to Lord
Lonsdale. Then he. took the picture to
Paris and finally brought it to America,
where it was concealed for fifteen years.
In the meantime Worth was arrested in
Brussels and forced to serve seven
received a telegram telling
him that an important letter was at his
home. The letter was from Worth, who
asked for an interview. This was grant
ed and Worth said he was going to die
and wanted to "turn up" the Gains
borough picture in order that his two
children, who had been educated in a
convent, might enjoy the proceeds.
Through a hitch the picture was not re
covered at that time. Worth returned to
London, and early last spring he fulfilled
his bargain.
There were many other witnesses In the i
courtroom* for the opposition, but it was
too late to hear them, and the matter i
went over until to-morrow at 9 o'clock. '
Â¦when Mrs. Hannah M. Neimann and Mrs !
Elizabeth Mitchell,- who signed the pro-;
test, will be heard. .
"He don't preach the Congregational
doctrine. He preaches purgatory, and we
don't believe in those sort of things. We
are willing to support the church, but
nothing of that kind."
"What objection do, they have to htm?"
â¢ "Because the people of the present loca
tion do, not 'like his preaching. They
won't go to listen to himâ that's why the
church is not prosperous. A whole lot of
us left the church on his account."
"Why?" questioned an attorney.
Don't Want Purgatory.
George S. Naismith, secretary of the
board of 1 trustees of the church, produced
the books to show that the. meeting at
which the resolution -to change was passed
was regular. Edward Leiter and Miss
May Leiter corroborated him. . The Rev.
Mr. Brown simply gave it as his opinion
that it would be wise to. change from the
present locality. â¢ - - -- Â¦ â¢ â¢
In behalf of the protestants Mrs. John
Trotter testified that If the. church was
removed it would take away the oppor
tunity for the children of the neighbor
hood to worship in the Sabbath-school
and at the young people's meetings. She
expressed the belief that the people of the
proposed new district would not go to
hear the pastor.
"Yes, I suppose they want to give me a
little of It this morning to convince me
that there is such a place.','
Dr. McLean was asked if he thought it
well to change from the present. location
because a rtajority of the .people in the
neighborhood are goor. He replied that
it was not for the poverty. that he would
advocate removal, but because a new lo
cation, where there fs a larger population,
is absolutely essential to the existence pf
the church. There are other \ churches
that the people could attend in the neigh
borhood by walking a short distance.
"Yes; some of them complained that I
did not preach enough hell or devil or
any of the other things discussed by
them, but then I couldn't help that."
"They want more hell and the devil, do
they?"
Didn't Pjeach Hell Enough.
"Well, for the eight months ending De
cember 1 last those who wanted to move
gave $510 75, while those who didn't want
to move contributed but $129 S&. The pro
portion Is maintained through the three
previous years."
"Your opponents claim that you have
not been preaching Congregational doc
trine?" '
"How do the contributions of your op
ponents compare with those of your
friends?" was asked.
"Since we proposed to remove some of
them have been active against me; be
fore that they were dissatisfied with my
theology. Some of those who are the
most bitter have only been to church
six times in the four years I've been at
the church. They quarreled with their
previous pastor. I tried every way to get
them to contribute to the church, but
they wouldn't. I understood that it was
by a unanimous vote that I was called to
the church or I wouldn't have gone."
"No, it isn't. I have been a Salvation
Army captain and worked among the
poor all my life. I love the poor."
"Isn't it a fact that your parishioners
are nearly all dissatisfied with you?"
"Isn't it a fact that you want to move
because you will get into a more aris
tocratic neighborhood?" asked Attorney
Wood on cross-examination.
The Rev. Mr. Bayley was the principal
witness for the removal. Answering the
questions of Attorney Charles E. Snook,
representing . the petitioners, he said he
had been an advocate of a change for
two years, as he felt . that the change
would.be beneficial by going into a new
district. He had canvassed the new dis
trict and. found that it would support the
church comfortably. He had done every
thing possible to influence the proposi
tion.-
Advocated the Change.
Prepared to talk on both sides of the
question, the members of the unhappy
congregation were on hand in quantities
in the courtroom when the application
was called for hearing. That the church
goers are not a unit on the subject of the
proposed change from the present site at
Thirty-fifth and Adeline streets to one
in the neighborhood of Thirty-sixth and
Grove streets any one could see with the
naked eye, for some of them sat in one
part of^the lobby and some in another
and deigned not to fraternize.
The advocates of removal were backed
with heavyweight reasons for the change
when they appeared in court, and they
had the Rev. J. K. McLean, president of
the Pacific Theological Seminary, and
the Rev. C. R. Brown of the/ First Con
gregational Church to help/ them out.
The protestants didn't get in all their
evidence at the close of the day, so Judge
Hall will give them another chance to
morrow.
The question of removal, it seems, is
not so much the cause of the disturbance
among the members of the Fourth Con
gregational Church as it is the question
of the theology, of their pastor, the Rev.
Alfred C. Bayley. In Judge Hall's court
to-day, where the petition for removal of
the church and the counter petition were
advocated by "pros a'nd cons" of the con
gregation, the pastor told how some of
his nock were dissatisfied with him be
cause he did not preach enough hell for
them. His opponents then came back at
him to tell that the trouble was all due
to the pastor's advocacy of the doctrine
that there is a purgatory for all the sin
ners of this earth. Some of the unbe
lievers in his creed, the pastor replies,
have been trying to' get him out and
making it a good deal warmer for him
than tne place they want him to preach
about.

Governor Taft also said that he differed
from General Bell on the point of the gen.
era! desire of the inhabitants to maintain
hostilities in Batangas; he did not believe
the common people felt so inclined.
Taking up the question of the "tariff.
Governor Taft explained the present sys
tem of taxation in the Philippines, saying
that under the decision of the Supreme
Court no duties are now being collected
on articles going into the islands from the
United States. The plan of the commis
sion had been to have no Internal .system
of taxation for the support of the general
government of these islands. Under the
Spanish eystem there was a general poll
tax, which netted about $7,000,000, while
the receipts from the customs were only
about $5,000,000. Even children were taxed
under that -system. Under Spain theie
also was a tax upon business enterprises,
end that sy6tem had been continued to
an extent by the commission. The Â¦com
mission also had decided to maintain the
poll tax to the extent of $1 per head on
adult males, but to apply It only to pay
ing the governmental expenses of the
towns and the provinces. The people of
the islands had generally urged the impo
sition of the poll tax as necessary to get
some of their numbers to work. Under
the Spanish regime the plan had been
used to enforce a sort of slavery.
That originally the people of the Philippine
Islanfia were much aroused I do not dowbt,
but the opposition does not continue In its,
teneral aspect. Since the second election of
President McKlnley the great Tnajbrlty of the
xwople.of the Philippines have been favorable
to iseace and to the acceptance of the sov
ereignty of the United States, and it would be
impossible to continue the present eystem of
guerrilla warfare without the 6ystem of ter
rorism which now prevails. That la my con
clusion and In to far as the statement differs
from General MacArthur' Â¦ report to that ex
tent I dlfter from him.
Carmack quoted from the report of Gen
eral MacArthur of 1900 to ,tha effect that
there is substantial unity among the Fili
pino ' people in their opposition to the
United States. Replying, Governor Taft
said j the commission had not originally
accepted the general's conclusion, and
that the commission's tour of'the archi
pelago had convinced them that they
were correct In their conclusion. Continu
ing he said:
WASHINGTON. Feb. 6.â Governor Taft

seems determined ". to dfe. \ He attempted
suicide on three separate occasions to-day,
once in a crowded courtroom, once by
swallowing broken glass and once by try
ing to drown himself in' a bathtub. Each
time his effort to take his own life was
frustrated Just in the nick of time. The
Count was given a preliminary hearing
this morning on ,the charge of- false
swearing in making affidavit that the run
away girl was above 18, the age of con
sent in Texas. After a sensational trial
the court Â¦ bound him over to the Grand
Jury- In the sum of J10OO, and In default of
bail he was ordered = back to jaiL Just
previous to the . rendering of | the decree
the Count was seen to take a pellet from
his pocket and swallow it. His bride of
a month was by his side, having rejoined
him for" the first time since his imprison
ment. Ten minutes after taking the drug
the Count reeled and fell to the floor In
convulsions. There was Intense â¢excite
ment as he was dragged out Into the open
air, and physicians were summoned. They
said he was suffering from the effects of
strychnine poisoning, and administered
the usual antidotes. An hour, later the
Count was sent back* to jail partially re
stored. He was placed in a ceil and left
to -recover. As soon as his guard had
gone he attempted to drown himself in a
bathtub, but was discovered before life
was extinct. A bottle of medicine was
left beside his bed. He bro^e the bottle
Into fragments and was endeavoring to
swallow .them when the jailer interfered
and prevented him.

Â¦WASHINGTON; Feb. 6.â The Senato
Committee on Commerce to-day. heard the
interests affected by the Nelson bill rela
tive to London dock charges. The whole
matter was elaborately discussed In a re
port made by Embassador Choate, which,
report frequently was referred to In tho
discussion.. John Crosby of Minneapolis
appeared for the flour shippers and J. J.
McKelvey for the lumbermen. These two
Interests are those most affected by the
London dock charges. They want the
charges for dockage Included In tha
freights charged by tho steamship compa
nies, and not carried as a separate ex
pense. The representatives of the ship
pers claim that under the present system
they are subject to discrimination. J. J.
Hemphlll, .who represented the steamship,
companies, argued that the dock charges
ought not to be Included in the freight;
that the steamship companies could not
tell what the charges would be In the fu
ture, and that various circumstances
might cause an increase of charges. Larga
freight ships plying between the United,
States and London were at a disadvan
tage .with, the smaller ships, which did tho
carrying business from South Atlantic
countries, because the small vessel could
go farther up the Thames. It was stated
during the hearing that London and
Antwerp were the only great ports in the
world where dock charges were not fixed
by statute and specific, so that shippers
and ship companies know what the costa
will be.

Hoar concluded the debate of the after
noon and in the course of his remarks
paid a brilliant tribute to Thomas-Cor
win, who. In the face of a hostile Senate
had uttered the sentiment which he had
quoted earlier in the flay. -He: declared
that Corwin's name and memory had be
come one of the treasures of the republic
and that he had been placed among the
immortals of this Government. The great
questions now before the country he said
could be discussed temperately and calm
ly. It was a- great question whether this
powerful republic should crush the life
out of a republic modeled after our own
Government; it was a srreat question how
the slaughter of both Filipinos and Amer
icans was to be stopped. | â¢ > ~
_"Men as food as I am/, men wiser than

tecting it against ' violence, and v H oÂ£?e

pure and a symbol of justice. The one is
an honorable thine and the other is an
honorable thing. . Those â¢ who are resist
ing^the "resent policy of our Government
in the Philippines are quite as loyal as
those who are supporting it "
The difference of opinion which hns
arisen- among the people, he said in con
clusion, was the "legitimate result of this
miserable Philippine business." ; . ,\. .--<"
Our Army Must BÂ« Victorious.
â¢"In view. of this statement," said he,
"'we* must continue this infamous, tyran
nical'-British South Africanâ" Then hesi
tating a\ few seconds he continued: "I'll
stop right there, because I cannot find a
word hot enough to apply to the situa
tion." .- Â¦ Â¦'-
In response to a question from Patter
son Foraker said that there was . not a
single word in the sedition laws adopted
by the Philippine Commission which
would enable the authorities to touch any
man who was loyal to the United States
: Tillman said that he had seen a state
ment" from General Chaffee tha.f practi
cally, the entire Philippine population was
imbued with a hatred of Americana.
Foraker replied that the people of Ohio
did love to recall the memory of Thomas
Corwin, but they realized, he said, that
in that great emergency he had made a
profound mistake.
Hoar again interrupted Foraker, and
Â¦directing attention to the declaration in
the Senate chamber of Thomas Corwin
of Ohio during a debate on the Mexican
war that If he were a Mexican he would
welcome the Americans with bloody
hands to hospitable graves, inquired if
the people of Ohio did not reverence the
name and memory of, Thomas Corwin.
Tillman interrupted Foraker to de
nounce the sedition laws enacted by the
Philippine Commission as "damnable doc
trine."
"It might be in order, said Foraker
warmly, "to inquire of the Senator from
South Carolina on which side of the
struggle in the Philippines are his sym
pathies."
. "My sympathies are with the Filipinos,"
shouted Tillman, poundinsr his desk em
phatically. . â¢ .
"Undoubtedly they are," retorted For
aker, "and such a flat-footed and unqual
ified declaration as the Senator has made
would render the, revised statutes appli
cable to him if he were not protected by
his position as Senator."
Sympathies With Filipinos.
Foraker said he never had heard the
Philippine acts read until now. He was
surprised, however, that the Senator from
Massachusetts (Hoar) should be mental
ly and morally disturbed by such provis
ions as had been heard. When Hoar had
desired to know, he added, whether it
were possible that the United States had
enacted such provisions he had sent for
the United States statutes and had had
read the acts upon treason and offenses
against the, country.
"Not only are the provisions the same,"
he declared, "as those contained- in the
Philippine acts, but the wording in both Is
practically identical. The Philippine Com
mission adopted the language of the re
vised statutes, adding such matters . as
would make the provisions applicable to
the Philippine Islands."
"I am quite ready," said Hoar, "to be
lieve what the Senator has said of so able
and humane a man as Governor Taft."
Patterson interrupted Hoar to say that
one of the members of the Philippine
Commission ought to be relieved from any
odium attaching to the â¢ enactment jof the
Philippine sedition. laws. Governor Taft,
he said, nad informed the Philippine Com
mission that he was ill when these acts
were enacted by the commission, and that
had he been present â¢ there probably
would have been some modification of the
acts.
Hoar then spoke briefly upon the sedi
tion laws enacted by the Philippine Com
mission, saying he was sorry that the
commission had had its act justified by
reference to the only harsh and cruel
provisions that were to be found in the
statutes of the United States. Under this
cruel provision in the Philippine Com
mission's ; laws a mother . having
knowledge of treason of her son must' in
form the authorities upon him; the son
must inform upon the mother; the brother
upon the brother; .the daughter upon the
father, and so on. He said the laws of
the United States were applied only to
citizens of this country, citizens by either
nativity or adoption. In the case of the
application in the Philippines, he said
they were being put into execution by
alien authority responsible only to an
alien Government or command. -
Hoar Criticizes Sedition Laws.
That merchandise in bonded warehouses,
otherwise In the custody and control of the
officers of the customs, upon which duties have
been paid, shall be entitled, on shipment to
the Philippine Islands within three years from
the date of the original 'arrival, to a return of
the duties .paid, less 1 per cent, and merchan
dise upon wh'lcn duties have not been paid may
be shipped without the payment of duties to
the Philippine Islands within said period un
der such rules and regulations as may be pre
scribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. :
This perfected the bill so far as- the
committee was concerned.
When the reading had ! been concluded
Lodge secured the adoption of the iol
lowing amendment:
At the conclusion of the reading For
aker sent to the clerk's desk and had read
sections 5331 to 5338, inclusive, of the re
vised statutes of the United States, deal
ing with' the same offenses.
Toward the close of the session the dis
cussion became ' heated. In response to a
resolution offered several days ago by
Rawlins, of Utah, the Secretary of War
transmitted, to the Senate the sedition
laws enacted by the 'Philippine Commis
sion. They were read in full and im
mediately drew the fire of the opponents
of the Government's" Philippine policy,
Hoar, Foraker, Tillman and others par
ticipating in a sharp debate.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 6.â For four hours

mission is concerned, all. of the commit
tee amendments being adopted. Several

Foraker of Ohio Says South
Scott concluded by strongly urging the
adoption of his resolution, saying that he
wished to be convinced of the practicabil
ity or impracticability of a ship tunnel
and had submitted his resolution as a pure
business proposition.
(1) Its healthy location; (2) its shortness;
(3) its magnificent harbors; (4) Its total ab
sence of locks; (5) the possibility or working
gangs of men night and day in the wet and
dry seasons under good sanitary conditions;
(6) the very important consideration that by
this route and no other sailing vessels could
be towed by electric power, by night as well
as by day. thus effecting a great saving: of
time and expense; (7) the economical main
tenance of the canal when completed; (8) the
permanency of Its rockbed and the absence of
earth embankment; (9) trfc desirable fact that
It can be constructed within three or at' most
five rears.
For the following 1 reason Scott believed
the San Bias route was the only feasible
and practical sea level canal route:
Scott explained that the San Bias route
connected the two oceans from the bay of
Mandingo. in the Gulf of San Bias, on the
Atlantic side Â£o Pearl Island harbor, In
the Gulf of Panama, on the Pacific side
of the isthmus. Including the flve-rnile
tunnel, the canal would be thirty miles
long. He said that the harbors of the
San Bias route . had excited the enthu
siasm, of all engineers who had Investi
gated them. He believed that electrical
power made it entirely practicable by this
route to tow ships through the canal by
electric trolley. He thought It improb
able that sailing vessels would be able to
navigate any other of the proposed routes.
The route he proposed, he* said, offered
great natural and commercial advantages.
He did not believe any one would question
the desirability of a ship canal by the San
Bias if the tunnel, which -1t. involved,
could be constructed and he had no doubt
this could be done. He referred to the
Hoosac. mount Cenis, St. Gothard, Arl
berg and Simplon tunnels as daring and
successful efforts of modern engineering.
He quoted both American and European
engineering authorities to show that the
construction of the San Bias tunnel was
quite practicable.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6.â At the con
clusion of the routine business in the
Senate to-day Scott (Rep.) of "West
Virginia called up â¢ and had ' read
a resolution - which he offered sev
eral days ago â¢ providing for the
appointment of a commission of experts
to examine what is known as the San
Bias or Mandingo Bay route, for an isth
mian waterway and to report to the'Sen
ate the cost of constructing ah inter
fceanic canal by that route. â¢" He said that
nearly one-fourth of the sum necessary to
construct a canal by any. of the â¢ routes
proposed already had been expended- in
an endeavor to find a suitable route* for an
isthmian canal; but confronted as .'Con
gress was by a proposed appropriation oi
marly $200,000,000 for the building - of a*i
lnteroceanic waterway, it was the duty
of prudent men to. carefully Investigate
every possible route. He disclaimed any
intention to obstruct the consideration of
a canal bill or to delay the building of the
canal itself, but he maintained that the
question of route was still doubtful. " After
thorough investigation he was convinced
that the San Bias route met practically
every requirement of the proposed water
way, but because the adoption of that
route involved the driving of a tunnel
ttrough the granite of a mountain range
sufficiently large to admit of the passage
of any ship afloat, the route had been re
garded as impracticable. Personally he
tvse convinced that such a tunnel could
be constructed at a reasonable cost.

The athletes will now ; have to turn their attention
to. the. Thunderer, and Kipling can, give his mind to!
the composition ' of a new and , rougher blast at the
aristocracy that , desires empire without . having the "
courage to; fight for it. . ". ' 'Â¦'. ' ..Â¦â¢.',' a-";^
Furthermore^ the Times says the men who are fore
most bn'th'e ball grounds have not been prompt in
responding to the call of the country for 'volunteers
for the war... In short, the conclusion i is that Kipling
is fully j ustified in 'denouncing Â¦ the athletes as Â¦ "flan
neled 'fools at the 'wickets and muddled oafs at ' the :
goals," and that empire cannot put its trust 'in- such,
men. Â¦ : ,
â¢ The Times says the. public delight in games has
now reached â¢ a point where engagement, -in athletic
sports is virtually "compulsory" upon : every young
man who has any leisure at all. The schools expect it
of every- robust pupil and the universities of. every
stalwart student. After, graduation . the .young \ man
finds that his county or his club, expects, him to con
tinue, at, the games in order'to uphold its "prestige in
the face of rivalry} By reason of the pressure of such
a public sentiment, cricket and football have become
"the. serious business" of many young men who
ought to be much better employed. The games them
selves lose in value by the devotion of the people to
them, because they cea'se'tb be a means of recreation
and become a pursuit'requiring excessive training^and
exhausting 'trials of strength and /speed. '" : '
KIPLING- has been, supported by the .London
Times in his a.ttack' upon the' "flanneled
fools" and "muddled oafs" of Great Britain
who spend their time playing cricket and golf.instead
of learning how to be of use to their country in pro
tecting the "lordliest line in the world." While mpst
of. the voices of Britain have been loud in commenda
tion of the healthful games of the schools, universi
ties and clubs, and either indignant or sarcastic 'in
criticizing the poet 1 for his rough-rhymed attack upon
them, the Times says Kipling is rightâ that the devo
tion to games and athletic sports in Great Britain has
been carried too far and has become a positive evil in
the land. Â¦ . -â¢â¢ ' , . '

In a single week recently New, York received 60,
000 sacks of pojjjtoe's imported from Great Britain
and Boston about 5000 sacks, so.it would seem the
old country has a few' foodstuffs in sufficient quantity
to share with her neighbors.
Â£>ENAT0R BACON of Georgia has introduced
a resolution' providing for, the general circula-
tion of the Congressional Record. His propo
sition is to offer it to the public like any other publi
cation, at a price 3 of about $2 for each session, the
Government engaging to publish and distribute as;
many copies as are required to supply the demand."
â¢ The Senator supported his resolution by saying it
is designed to give the people fuller ! information
concerning the proceedings of Congress than are ob
tainable through. the p*ress. Senator Hawley of Con
necticut commended the proposition^ and in doing so
lamented the comparative neglect of Congress by
the newspapers of to-day. He stated that his own
newspaper experience runs back forty : or fifty years,
and that in former, times the press gave a much
fuller account of the proceedings of Congress and of
the speeches of distinguished 'members than is given
by the press' of to-day... Believing that the decline in
the amount of space given to Congress is doing harm
to the country, he joins with Senator Bacon in urging
a measure to make the Congressional Record fill a
long-felt , want . . Â¦Â¦' / ' ,
Of course anything, that increases popular, knowl
edge of the course of. national legislation will be
beneficial. There are a good many people doubtless
who have time to read the Record and who are will
ing to do so. It is probable some such persons can
be induced to *>ay $2 for the privilege of reading the
proceedings of a session; ' but as under existing .con
ditions almost any one can obtain the Record from
his Congressman without, paying' anything for it at
all, it is not likely the numberjfof subscribers would
be large. " \. .- '";,'Â¦'.- Â¦'Â¦â¢';'5- r *-.-,
Asa- matter of fact the newspapers give the public
about Vl: the proceedings .of Congress that the pub
lic care to read. Times have changed since Senator
Hawley began his career as a. newspaper man 'fifty
years ago. In those' old days the American people
were not much interested 'in anything except poli
tics, and naturally enough thg newspapers gave most
of their space to news from Washington. Very dif
ferent is the condition, of. affairs now. The "advance
ment of science, .the tremendous expansion of indus
try, the' increasing variety and interest of' American
social life and the development of international com-'
merce have brought new demands- upon the public
and upon the newspapers. Â£uch matters can no
longer be dismissed-in a{ paragraph while a i page is
given to a speech of a Senator at Washington. More
over,, while these diverse interests have, been increas-.
ing "public interest in politics, has. been decreasing.
We are no longer engaged in such strenuous politics
as that which preceded and led up. to the Civil War.

Why. should any sane people think of giving up a
known and certain good for the chance of obtaining
a benefit unknown and uncertain? Many .are the
pleas that have been made for reciprocity, but in al
most every case the pleader has been either an out
and out free-trader or else a man who wishes protec
tion for his own industry but is willing to deny it to
other Americans. There are conditions of course
under which profitable reciprocity treaties could be
made by the people of the United States, but it is
hardly worth while to run the risk of endangering
the protective system by venturing upon them at this
time.
In sharp contrast to the obscurity of the reciprocity
theory stands the clearness of the protective system.
As Mr. Gardiner says: "Protection we know. . It has
grown with our growth and expanded with the na
tion. The policy of no section, it is continental and
American. For 125 years it has been as fundamental
to our commerce as is the constitution to our Gov
ernment. Foreign nations have always recognized it
and' have made their treaties and adjusted their, trade
relations on the basis of our established protective
system."
The uttermost that can be said for the various re
ciprocity treaties that have been negotiated since the
Dingley ir.riff was enacted is that they promise a
commercial advantage to some American industries.
No one can guarantee that such advantages would
more than offset the losses occasioned to other indus
tries by depriving them of- protection. In venturing
upon reciprocity, therefore, we would be embarking
upon an untried policy, one whose results cannot be
accurately computed. We would be turning away
from a fiscal system which long experience has
proven to be beneficial to all American industries
for the sake of trying one that at the best does no
more than promise benefits to a few' industries in
stead of to all.
The reciprocity theory, the speaker pointed out, is
based upon a "mistaken conception of President Mc-
Kinley's Buffalo address." To quote the language
of Andrew Carnegie, "reciprocity is an easy word to
s&y, but a difficult policy to inaugurate." Moreover,
even if it were inaugurated it would be futile in most
cases, for, as Mr. Gardiner says: "The essence of
reciprocity is the concession of special tariff rates to
one country at the expense of others. If reciprocity
should be extended, concessions would multiply;
and should it Wome general and concessions be
made to all, then all concessions to one would neces
sarily be nullified. Trade would, resume its rutural
course. Our protective tariff would be reduced with
out the slightest gain in foreign markets."
CHARLES A. GARDINER in a recent address
to the New York Credit Men's Association
on the subject dfc American commercial ex
pansion presented in a striking way the fallacy of the
doctrine that we can extend our trade only by re
ciprocity treaties. His plea was for a firm mainte-^
nance of the policy of comprehensive protection, un
der which our industries have prospered and our
trade has expanded to an extent that has made it the^
marvel of the-^ge.
PROTEOTION OR RECIPROCITY.
TO Miss Rachel Louise McAusland, who is socially well
known "" in New York, .the- mail from Berlin recently
brought a strange present. It was a dueling sword,
and with It came a letter from, a young .German -lieu-.
' tenant,' saying that with it he had fought for her hand
on the field of honor. ! His opponent had been a young Eng
lishman connected with the diplomatic service.
. . At her home, -where aha lives with her mother, Miss Mc-
Ausland told of her gift and naively added that she did not
share the superstitious belief â¢ of some that friendships were
often broken by the acceptance of a weapon as a present
Miss McAusland disclaimed a rpmantle disposition, but told
with some satisfaction of how the youngr English diplomat and
the soldierly lieutenant fought for the favor of her hand. -
Miss McAusland is the daughter of James McAusland, who
died several years ago. She went abroad to.be educated, and
in the winter of 1S9S she was introduced to society In Stutt-
srart, Germany, by the Countess von Linden, ths wlfa of the
former German Minister to Russia, herself a former New York
gin.
â¢ It was at a reception In her honor that Miss McAnsland
met the diplomat and the soldier. They paid her marked at
tention, and at several of the European capitals thereafter
durins the winter. - t . . .': . , : .
Miss McAusland confesses that from tho'. first ahÂ« -was
rather more strongly attracted by the eolfiler. Things mili
tary, shesald, always Impressed her, and the young lieutenant
was the very pick of the Kaiser's army.
In April, 1899, : Mls3 McAusland returned to New York, still
heart whole. She afterward learned the diplomat and the
soldier met In a duel, but whether either man waa wounded
or not is a matter of speculation.

MISS RACHEL. LOUISE McAUSLAND, A NEW YORK SOCIETY GIRL., FOR WHOSE HAND A GERMAN IJEtJ
TENANT AMD A BRITISH DIPLOMAT FOUGHT A DUEL. ABROAD, THE ARMY OFFICER SENDING HER
HIS DUELING SWORD AS A PRESENT.
It appears from all of these contradictory showings
that both the Boers and the British are ' making
grand stand plays in public, but are secretly working
through the Dutch Government to arrange for end
ing a war of which both sides are tired. At present
the negotiation shows .a very pretty game in dip
lomacy. The Dutch Government officially and for
mally declares it has no. intention of intervening, and
will not consent to mediate. Itvannounces it has no
intention to even suggest anything. The British de
clare they have no terms- to offer to any except 'the
Boers in the field, and the terms to .them are uncon
ditional surrender. The Boers in their turn assert
a determination not to negotiate for anything, ex
cept independence. Still the talk of peace goes on,
and it seems evident that each of the three parties to
the game has much better cards in his sleeve than he
shows ia his hand. .... Â¦ . .,.
While the Boer leader is thus uttering publicly his
determination to stand by the platform of "liberty or
death" the British Liberals insist that the chief-ob
stacle in the way of peace is Joseph Chamberlain and
the. Ministry which supports him. It is pointed out
that the Government has never declared a generous
policy toward the Boers, nor has it, in fact, an
nounced any definite^ programme whatever. Refer
ring to Chamberlain's speeches the Westminster
Gazette says: "He will not say he is for the policy
of unconditional surrender, but neither .will he say he
is against it. He will not say the Government will be
deaf to overtures, but he proceeds to wipe off the
slate almost every Boer leader who could possibly
make them. -/-At' one* moment he uses' fairly concilia
tory language, but at the next he is making threats
which, as regards the most important people con
cerned, entirely close the door on conciliation."
If such; agreement .on the part of the. Boers is
"definitely known" in- Amsterdam- it is \ certainly
known nowhere else. The Berlin correspondent of
the London News reports that President Kruger re
cently said to a friend in speaking of the probability
of peace: "If intervention could shorten the war,
even only by a day, we should hail it with thanks in
the name of those whose unutterable sufferings would
be lessened by it. -But we should not be grateful
for an intervention which' did not reckon, with our
aspirations for independence. A peace which one
often hears. proposed on the English sideâ subjection
first, then a sort of autonomyâ that we will never
accept." . '. - ' 9
The Amsterdam. correspondent of the London Mail
asserts it: is definitely known" in that city that the
Dutch Premier's recent visit to London has resulted
in the persuasion of. President kruger and the Boer,
delegatesjin, Europe to consent. to waive. the claim
for the acknowledgment of the independence of the
Transvaal and Orange Free State as a prerequisite to
any, consideration of / peace.' He adds that the. idea*
now' is that of a partial '"incorporation" of the repub
lics with the empire as distinct from absolute annexa
tion, and that the discussion turns mainly upon the
terms on -which banished Boers will be permitted 'to
return -and the amount of damages to be paid by the 1 :
British to the Boers for rebuilding and restocking
their homesteads. . '"'. '
FROM the" 1 steadiness with 'which the peace | talk .
goes onin London it seems probable the Gov
ernment has given encouragement to the pro
moters of the movement to bring about negotiations
with tKe .Boer leaders. Neither, side of- course, dis- :
plays in public any willingness to yield & jot of its
.original, pretensions, but. at the same time the Hol
land Government would; hardly .persist in its efforts
were.it not that secret- assurances are given of ulti
mate success. ' ;"Â¦â¢"Â¦'.Â¦Â¦ 'â¢â¢"'Â¦Â«' â¢Â¦'Â¦' Â¦'Â¦-Â¦'; Â¦'Â¦ : ' : . ;â¢: Â¦
â¢ OBSTACLES TO PEACE.
The Princess Sophie, Bamba Dhuleep Singh was
pelted with snow a few days ago by some rude Chi
cago k ,bbys and /she left in great indignation for Can
ada - It js also saidthat she took : her name with her.
Let the next Legislature hear a loud call to stick
to the possible, to achieve it without demagogue
blather, and we may yet "get, something out of our
Railway Commission to justify its existence. . ' â¢
The Legislature may well be admonished. That
body has heretofore occasionally chosen to acquire a
reputation for zeal by attempting the impossible. Let
it not tamper with interstate commerce and rates. â¢ If
it .'impinge the commission's authority on any such
legislation the courts will void it. The foxy brethren
who know that our California exporters" are caused to
perspire, by some of the long haul rates eastward are
entirely* capable of introducing such measures to
make 'themselves solid' with the fruit and other out
shippers by pretending to help them by doing some
thing that if it became law would be of no more effect
than the incantation of a Digger Indian before an
image made of a Yankee pumpkin. '
The wild but well meaning people who made our
present constitution thought that in 'creating the
Railroad Commission they were planting a thorn in
the railroads. But the only thorn around has proved
to be that on .which the commission sat. While
the 'resulting pain has been assuaged by a salary and
headquarters,' 'the acute stage is now here, and either
the Kentucky law must be adopted in this State or
the commission must be substituted by some readier
method of compelling conclusions.- Our commission
is charged with a lot of impossible duties. Among
these it must adopt a set of books and a method of
bookkeeping and compel their adoption by all rail
roads. There has never been a member of the com
mission who knew any more about bookkeeping than
bookkeeping knew about him. It is time toitake
away from the commission the numerous thirigs it
cannot do and, give it the few, plain and necessary
things it can and ought to do.
Adopt "into our_ system the Kentucky law and the
whole situation is changed. The -commission then,
like the centurion, can say to a Grand>Jury "Come,"
and it cdmeth, and to a Judge ."Go,".; arid he goeth.
The commission by the Kentucky law becomes the
prosecutor, can assist or replace the local prosecuting
officer, can draw- indictments and appear with -them
â¢in the Grand Jury room. . In this State, under- our
law of initiation of criminal proceedings, it need not
wait for a presentment by a Grand Jury7 but can hold
up an octopus on informatipn and belief, qualified to
before any committing magistrate, ' and thereon can
promptly hale a railroad before a petit ' jujiy and
prosecute it. ' . .y .. . ' . ,:
When a Railroad Commission makes a decision,; as
in the oil cases in this State,- the courts cannot avoid
giving their- power - l in temporary restraint nor the
hearing of argument why thaY restraint : should be
made permanent. But it will be seen that ourRail- r
road Commission gets into court only by being
chosen defendant in a lawsuit, and has to go before
the bench and sit in the chair of thefcringer just as
if it were a .common personality accused of overdriv
ing, a livery horse or tunning away with a neighbor's
wife. , â¢ \ "Â¦'. 'Â¦-Â¦â¢- ":':Â¦:Â¦ . Â¦. Â¦' '
THE importance of the recent . decision of the
United States Supreme Court validating the law
of Kentucky, which makes the judicial courts the
instrument of an executive or legislative commission
for the management and public oversight of railways,
is of prime importance in its relation to domestic
traffic, c.onfined to ..points, within the State., Hereto
fore when committees and commissions created of
legislative*, creation, with administrative functions
have appealed to the Federal process for enforcement
of their decisions the courts have declined to consider
themselves as v the subordinate and instrument of such
minor executive body. On the other hand, the courts
have held. that they are part of a co-ordinate branch
of the Government itself, with authority rooted in the
constitution, and power and jurisdiction defined by
statute, and are not to be used as an executive con
venience. â¢ ' .', ' ' 'Â¦ ',

Henry Swanson was in his court yester
day on the charge of carrying a concealed
weapon. The Judge asked him if he had
an attorney and he replied, "Yes, I have
the prison attorney." The answer sur
prised the Judge, and on asking Swanson
for an explanation he said that an officer
in the prison had given him an attor
ney's card and suggested he should en
gage him, as he was a fine lawyer. The
card was that of Attorney Jackson. The
Judge continued the case and intimated
that he would make a thorough investi
gation. . , . , Â¦-'Â¦'-
The officer referred to isl Policeman
Murphy. He denies that he acted as

This was followed by the application ot
Mrs. Gowdey for letters of guardianship
and when these were granted her she Im
mediately commenced proceedings to re
cover the O'Hare gold and realty. Fol
lowing this suit came the arrest of Jac
ques and his wife on "a charge of kidnap
ing their aged charge, m
All three suits wergt. bitterly contested
and occupied the attention of the courts
for months. O'Hare*Â§T> money was finally
recovered and then followed suits to have
deeds made by the jaged incompetent set
aside. The compromise effected yesterday
is the result of a petition filed the day be
fore for permission to commence another
suit.
O'Hare came from Minneapolis and
went to live with the Jacques family. He
was worth about $75,000. Little attention
Â¦was paid to the old man, -who was suffer
ing from senility, until Thomas Jacques
was arrested on a charge of grand larceny
and accused by the brothers and sisters
of O'Hare of relieving the old man of his
wealth.
A compromise has been effected between
the relatives of Joseph O'Hare and
Thomas G. Jacques and his family. " In
consideration of the payment of $42,000 by
Jacques to Mrs. Margaret I*. Gowdey,
O'Hare's guardian, Â±he interested parties
have. consented to cease their legal bat
tles for the property of the old man. The
deeds made by O'Hare on April 9 and 10,
1S01, in consideration of the sum. paid are
to remain in effect. Thus ends one of the
most bitterly fought contests ever waged
in. the courts here. ,
Chief Engineer Dixon, "William Dun
leavy, third assistant engineer; Second
Officer Ramsey, Quartermaster Martin
-Windon and the lookout were the other
witnesses, but their testimony disclosed
no important .new Information.
In answer to a question by Inspector
Bolles, Cattarinich said tha strong cur
rent from the southwest set him In three
and . a half miles from where he should
have been. He said he waa Just on the
point of using the lead when the vessel
struck.
At 10:59 p. m., when I was going to ring
the slow bell, the ship struck at what proved to
be the starboard side, amidships. Immediately
as I felt the shock I signaled In the engine
room to stop and reverse the engine, which sig
nals were not answered; repeated the signals,
when the chief engineer came on the bridge
and reported the engine powerless with fifteen
feet of water In the engine-room. Ordered
soundings to be taken immediately and found
as much water In the after and main holds as
in the engine-room and eight feet in forward
hold, rapidly increasing. Soundings outside the
ship were taken and proved fourteen feet under
the bow. fifteen feet amidshlp and twenty feet
under the stern. Sea was then at half tide,
ebbing. I immediately called the crew to boat
station and with great promptness all the
boats were in the water, ready to save the lives
of passengers. "Women, children and all others
were placed in the boats, and after considering
that there was more danger of losing lives by
sending them on land at that time of the night
I called them back on board, assuring them that
it was safer to stay on board until daylight,
as the ship would not go down further than
she was. Gave them refreshments and as socn
as daylight sent them all in boats, In charge
of their respective officers, to La Llbertad.
where all were landed in safety. Thereafter
all ether precautions were taken to save bag
gage, mall and other properties. Very respect
fully, . : J. F. CATTARINICH.
At 10:40 p. m., appearing to be closer to tha
land than I had calculated, I altered the coursa
to East (mag.), then went In my room, pricked
ship's position In the chart, and In going bacls
on the bridge saw the chief engineer standing
near the purser's office and notified him that
in about fifteen minutes we should anchor, also
giving him Instructions for the morning to be
ready to move closer In case we were too far
out. "Went back on the bridge and gave my
order to the officer as usual prior to anchor
ing.
Steamer's Course Altered.
The steamship San Bias under my command
sailed from San Francisco November 24, 1901,
at noon, -bound to Panama and way ports as
per company's schedule.
The port of Acajutla (Salvador) waa reached
on tha 17th. of December at 6:04 a. m., and
sailed from the same at 7:00 p. m. for the port
of La Llbertad (Salvador). I gave the direc
tion of the sailing of the ship, Instructing thÂ»
engineer to set the engine at fifty-six revo
lutions per minute, which gave the shfp a
speed of 9% knots per hour. At 7:08 p. m. set
course S. \e, W. (mag). At 7:27 EaBt Rock,
off Remedlos Point, was abeam, bearing E. %
S. (magnetic), distance 2% miles. Deviation
of the compass on S S E was 2 deg. 40 min.
westerly.
At 8:13 altered course to B. % N. (mag.).
Deviation on this course was 4 degrees west
erly. At the same time I Increased the num
ber of revolutions to 60 per minute, which gave
the ship a speed of 10 knots per hour, and
which course should have taken the ship about
3% miles outside the port of La Libertad. At
about 10 o'clock p. m. I went on the bridge
and having reckoned the distance traveled and
taken into consideration the course I had given
the ship I came to tm conclusion that I waa
nearlng La Llbertad, which la an open road
stead.- In making this port I have always been
guided by a small flickering light at the end
of the pier. I called the attention of the sec
ond officer, J. W. Ramsey, to what appeared
to me to be the light of the port of La Libertad.
He looked with care and came to the conclusion
that It was the light of the port of La Llber
tad. The night was very dark, with heavy
rain clouds and smoke hanging over the land.
The sea was smooth, with heavy long south
erly swell.
Captain Cattarinich's testimony followed
closely the lines of the following state
ment made by him to the inspectors:
The unfortunate master v was the princi
pal witness. â¢ The wreck occurred during
the watch of .the second -officer, but the
captain very manfully testified that he
himself was in actual charge of tbe ves
sel and took the responsibility upon his
own shoulders. He said:
"I had the second officer with me on the
bridge,, but I was In full charge."
Cattarinich's course in this respect was
so unusual that the inspectors found It
most refreshing 1 , and certainly will be. In
clined to soften their judgment a3 much
as possible under the circumstances.
Master Tells of Disaster. '
Tho wreck of the Pacific Mail steamship
San Bias off the coast of Salvador on tho
night of December 17 was a subject of of
ficial investigation by the 'United States
inspectors of hulls and boilers yesterday
afternoon. The evidence showed that tha
master of the vessel. Captain J. P. Catta
rinich, had failed to use the lead, hence
did not know until tha steamer struck
that an unusually strong current had
driven his vessel inshore. It is probable
that Cattarinich will lose, his license.

ARRIVED.
The British ship Rahane, which arrived
here 'yesterday from Newcastle, Austra
lia, narrowly escaped going ashore on
Duxbury Reef. Incidentally the Rahane's
extremity was the golden opportunity of
the steam collier^Washtenaw, which the
coal carrier improved to the tune of $1000
The Washtenaw left this port Tuesday
and was plugging, along up the coast
when she sighted the Rahane flying sig
nals of distress. Th& collier went within
hailing distance and found the Britisher
in dangerous proximity to the reef. The
wind -was light and the current setting
the sailing ship nearer and nearer to the
dangerous breakers. For $1000 the Wash
tenaw gave the Rahane a line turned
back to the Golden Gate and towed the
windjammer to a safe anchorage off An
gel'Island. The Washtenaw then re
sumed her voyage to the north. The Ra
hane was out sixty-nine days from New
castle. ...

She certainly did raise the deuce, but they
ain't broke. They've got a home up on the
hill and they're livin' lavish.
The Occidental and Oriental steamship
Doric arrived yesterday from the Orient.
She brought thirty-four cabin passengers
and a valuable cargo. She had of treas
ure about $30,000 and $700,000 worth of silk.
Among the second class passengers were
a number of United States marines, who
have been in the hospital at Yokohama.
The marines appear to have passed the
period of their convalescence in keeping
tab on Captain -Strong and May Yohe.
The result of their observations was sum
med tip by a corporal with conciseness
and completeness. He said:

THE steamship Tucapel of the"
Companla Sud Americana de Va
pores arrived yesterday from Pa
nama with a big cargo and a
number of passengers. The Tu
capel left Panama just three weeks ago.
Thinga were getting pretty lively at the
isthmus about that time and preparations
were In full swins for the Â«aval battle
that took place a week later. As a re
sult of these preparations the Tucapel
made the trip here with a very scant
crew, Captain Moffett having been an in
voluntary contributor of a dozen men to
the fighting forces of the Colombian Gov
ernment While in Panama Captain Mof
fett had trouble with some of his crew,
who. oblected to make the trip to San
Francisco, although their term of service
called for in the articles they had signed
had not expired. Some of "the disaffected
were mollified by an increase in pay, but
six sailors and half a dozen firemen ab
solutely refused duty. Captain Moffett
appealed to the authorities, who express
ed themselves as only too delighted to
aid the steamship company. They took
charge of the recalcitrant sailormen and
locked them up in the Government prison.
"We will hold" them until youare ready
for sea," they told the skipper.
Meanwhile the Colombian Government
had seized, the steamship, Lautaro, of
the same company as the Tucapel, and
added her to the navy. Being short of
sailors for the Lautaro, the Government
borrowed the twelve Tucapel men. ' The
Tucapel was forced to sail short handed.
The twelve remained behind and some of
them probably went down with the Lau
taro when she was sunk in the naval
fight of January 20. When the Tucapel
sailed the Colombian Government had
agreed to pay the Compania Sud Ameri
cana $400,000 for the Lautaro. ;
The Tucapel brought cabin passengers'

Superintendent Webster filed the report
of his investigation In the complaint of
John UaRgio against Principal M. K

yesterday. Director Denman refused to
tnnkc the document public until the board
had discussed It in executive session. It
is known, however, that Webster finds

monos thnt the principal be accorded a
trial by the board as the charter pro

Director Woodward opposed the propo
sition tfl have half-day (sessions lor pupils
and urged that the school building ad
joining the Protestant Orphan Asylum
be rented for the outside classes. Ron
covieri stated that protests had been filed
against renting the building for sectarian
and other reasons and Mayor Schmitz
h:id advised caution. Woodward also op
posed paying the teachers in full for half
a day's work, but was overruled by his
colicap-ues, he alone voting no.
Thy Board of Public Works was re
quosicd to prepare and submit plans and
specifications for the addition of six
rooms to the Hearst School building.
The board was served with a court writ
restraining It from hearing charges
opainft Miss M. C. MeKinney. and the
trial was postponed until the writ is
passed upon.
It was also resolved that immediate ac
tion be taken to fumigate and alter the
building from the present six classrooms
to a lour-class room . building, and to
thoroughly remodel the sanitary condition
to conform to the plans of the Health
Hoard.
The Board of Education met yesterday
and adopted a resolution providing that
the classrooms used for the Hearst
School, located at Steiner and Hermann
streets, be discontinued and that the pu
pils thereof be transferred to the main
building of said school, and that princi
pals be Instructed to arrange halfr-day
s<.'f>=ions so as to accommodate the pupils
so transferred.
Continuing-, the operation of the present
exclusion act and the difficulties la the
way of its rigid enforcement are dis
cussed. The classes profiting by Chinese
Immigration are given as uie transporta
tion companies, warehousemen and cus
toms brokers, real estate dealers, inter
preters and lawyers with Chinese clients.
The statement concludes as follows:
In*view of the foregoing facts the Bulldin?
Trades Council again desires to place itself
upon record with reference to this question.
We believe that it is a question which affects
the welfare of every man. woman and child
in this country, and moreover in the State oÂ£
California: and to that end no better expres
sion of public sentiment could be had than to
have the press, through a system of voting,
give every citizen an opportunity to- record his
opposition to Chinese immigration and his sup
port to the passage of the exclusion act.
Classes Opposing Exclusion-
The Building Trades Council has placed
itself on record against the resolution*
on the question of Chinese exclusion now
under consideration by tne Chamber of
Commerce and the Merchants' Exchange.
A Statement, offered by Secretary Tveit
moe, was unanimously adopted last night.
The statement Is introduced as follows:
The prints of to-day contain reports of ac
tions taken by the Chamber of Commerce and
the Merchants' Exchange with reference to the
all-Important question^ of Chinese exclusion
now before Congress. This calls to mind the
action of the Chinese Consul General in call
ing a meeting at the rooms of the Chamber
of Commerce some eighteen months ago, which
action at that time was regarded by the Build
ing Trades Council as the beginning of a cam
paign for the repeal of the exclusion act. Re
cent events prove the correctness of that
theory. The movement had been on foot ior
some time, but had only appeared through tha
public utterances of Minister Wu Ting Fang
in Washington and Consul General Ho Tow in
this city wherein the gentlemen never lost an
opportunity to state that while we desired tha
"open door" and, the advantage which tne Chi
nese trade offered we are unwilling to accord
Chinese subjects the same rights and favors
that the subjects of other nations enjoy. The
present movement is stimulated, no dontjt,
through the rigid enforcement of the exclusion
act by the officials of the Chinese Bureau in
this city, and by such obedience to the law tha
immigration of undesirable coolie labor under
the guise of merchants, tradesmen, first vis
itors, etc., has been somewhat prevented.
Edwin Arden, supported by the mem
bers of the Grand Opera-house stock com
pany, produced an act of "Jim the Pen
man," and the audience was duly appre
ciative. Alf Holt came in from the Chutes
to whistle his way intd favor.
Three clever members of the ' Alcazar
stock company produced for the first time
a one-act play entitled "Goin' Home.
The story is that of a girl who has left her
country home and fell a victim to the temp
tations of a big city and is visited by her
aged parent. Miss Eva Dennlson played
the part of the erring daughter and Frank
Bacon enacted the role of the father.
Paul Gerson filled in as a. servant. The
play is full of pathos and quaint humor.
Ferris Hartman and the male members
of the Tlvoli gave the audience a taste of
the good things to be seen and heard In
"The Ameer." The biograph views closed
a successful entertainment.
GOLDEN GATE COUNCIL'S
FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY
now appearing at the Orpheum, sang a
number of popular songs, and then tne
Alcazar stock company followed with the
second act from Joaquin Miller 3 poetic
story of the days of '4&-"The Danites.
The audience laughed at the awkward
movements of the miners and, wept for
poor little Billy Piper,- cleverly portrayed
by Miss Marion Convere. Josephine Sapel
was next in line, and "the little lady with
the big voice" scored a. decided nit wit n
her songs and imitations. Her ability to
get her audience to whistle was severely
tested, as the theater was crowded with
the fair sex. The ladies, however, puck
ered to accommodate. the- clever soubrette.

Harry Emery's Case Against Charles
' B. Brockway Dismissed, by
* Judge Cabaniss.
The case of Charles B. Brockway, clair
voyant, 1052 Ellis street, charged with ob
taining-/money by .false, pretenses, from
Harry Emery, a widower, living at S30
Geary street, was by. Judge
Cabaniss yesterday on Emery's own testi
mony on the ground that the money was
paid for a future event and. not for a
past or existing event.
Emery was informed by Brockway that
he: could teach him how to hold com
munion with the spirit of his dead wife,
and, further, that he could give him
mediumistic powers. Emery began tak
ing lessons in August last and had alto
gether paid Brockway $53 in fees, but ha
had not yet been able to commune with
his wife's spirit. Brockway had, he said,
called, at his house and admitted the
whole 'thing was a "fake," but he had no
witness to corroborate, bjiri.;:.
â¢.Brockway came into prominence two or
three months ago by claiming that he and

There ie a good deal of talk in political
circles concerning the strength of the
Gafe machine and its ability to force
Gage's renomination on the Republican
party, but accounts from the south, from
the mountain districts and the northern
counties represent that the Republican
voters are going to take an active part in
the election of delegates to the State con
vention. There are indications that E. B.
Edson of Siskiyou will bring to his sup
port several delegations from fae far
north. Dr. Pardee may bring his follow
ers together and gain a solid delegation in
Aiameda. The Gage men count on win
ning Santa Clara and Sacramento coun
ttfl and nine of the Assembly districts of
San Francisco. In a general way San
Diego, Santa Barbara. Ventura, San Luis
Obispo, Riverside. San Bernardino, San
Joaquin, Sonora, Xapa and Contra Costa
counties are reckoned as against Gage.
The mountain countiesâ Tuolumne, Ama
dor, Calaveras. Nevada and Placer â may
send delegations friendly to Jacob H. Neff
and Harold Power. It is said that the
counties of Santa Cruz, Monterey and
San Benito will send Flint delegations.
Senator Flint expects to win quite a num
ber of delegates in the counties south of
Tehachapi. The boldness of his invasion
of Los Angeles County excites admiration.
Strength of the Gage Machine.
A year later. In November, 1901. there
was a slight decline in the Republican
vote. Asa R. Wells, the Republican nomi
nee for Mayor, received only 12,256 votes.
Here is a failing off of 22,8b6 Republican
votes. It is true that only 53,4Â»3 votes
were cast, but it is likewise true that the
RepuWican nominee for Mayor received
less than 25 per cent of the votes polled,
whereas, in Iw) the Republican leader ob
tained more than 50 per cent of the vote
cast. Wise and pruaent politicians who
look forward to victory at the polls as
one of the desirable results of a political
campaign may have taken note of the
fact that Republican voters and Repub
lican newspapers gave the party bosses a
him in advance that machine methods of
forcing nominations against the will of
the people would bring disaster to the
party.
In the Presidential election of 1900 San
Francisco cast t>4.>.63 votes, and 35,112 of
the voters supported the Republican
ticket. The majority inscribed on the
banner is 99%. In this election there was
complete harmony in the Republican
carnp. The Republican leaders were in
line. The Democratic newspapers were
attending to affairs in their own party
and were not giving their time and spacÂ«j
to the management of the Republican
campaign.
San Francisco Wins Banner.
Because Aiameda County in the dim
past won the Kepubiiqun banner from i>os
.-vngeies mere is an impression in tne
touih that Aiameda is really tne banner
republican County of caluorma. Poli
ticians should keep the truth in mind
that Kan Francisco is me oanner Repub
lican County or this State, 'ine original
X>os Angeles banner with majorities m-
Kcribed thereon is safeiy inclosed in a
glass case at the Union league Club, and
u the Republican State Convention makes
a wise nominauon tor Governor the ban
ner will stay there.
Dr. George C. Pardee's boom, like con
fidence, is a plant of slow growth. It
seems to flourish well enough in Alamed-i
County, but beyond the confines of the
officeholders' paradise it has hardly at
tained the proportions of a boomlet. In
the south Hint and Gage are struggling
for the mastery. The activity displayed
by the anti-boss forces in the organiza
tion of Flint clubs in the city of L,os An
geles has caused seme alarm in the Gage
camp. Before the middle of this montn
several well known workers of the Gage
machine will leave San Francisco for
{southern Calilornia for the purpose of
taking a hand in the preliminaries. Bulla,
lielsnaw and Flint are putting up a
stronger fight than the admirusfc-ation exÂ»
peeled anu one too big to ill resisted,
with any show of success, by Walter Par
ker, Correy Pendleton and johnny Wray.

Burton says that he came here recently
from the Klondike. He tells several con
flicting stories about his possession of the
trunk. The Federal authorities think
that he is only on* of a big crowd that
is smuggling . between British - Columbia
and this city. -
Yesterday afternoon Burton rang up
Expressman Gallagher and . told him to
take the trunk to the Cosmopolitan Hotel.
The customs inspectors went with Gal
lagher to see the trunk delivered, and it
was then discovered that Burton had only
engaged the room for the day. The trunk
was placed in Burton's room and the man
appeared at 6 o'clock last evening. , He
was arrested and taken to the ' County
Jail.~_
The trunk arrived here lost Monday,'
and Inspectors Campbell and Linquist
waited over at Oakland several days for
the man to come and call for the -trunk.
On Wednesday the trunk was brought
over to this side, and yesterday afternoon
Expressman C. E. GallagherÂ»of 28 Market
street called for it and presented the
check. , < .
He was detained; and then showed
clearly that he was an innocent party to
the affair. He' said that a man r named
Burton had told him to call for the trunk
and to hold it at his . ofHce until he re
ceived instructions over the telephone
where to take it.
Last Saturday Collector of the Port
Stratton received a dispatch from Col
lector Patterson of Portland that the
Federal authorities at Portland had seized
a trunk filled with seventy-five pounds of
opium consigned to Frank D. Burton. The
trunk was checked through from Tacoma
to the Sixteenth street depot, Oakland.
Surveyor of the Port Spear was placed in
charge of the case, and > he, with the as
sistance of his chief deputy, Chauncey M.
St. John, decided that the opium,' with the
exception of qne can, should be taken out
by the authorities in the north and the
trunk should be again shipped to Frank
Burton at Oakland. .â¢ â¢ Â¦
Custom Inspectors J. "W. Campbell and
V. J. Lindquist cleverly captured Frank
D. Burton, an opium smuggler, . at ~ the
Cosmopolitan Hotel last evening. He is
wanted on a charge- of smuggling opium
here from British Columbia.

The closing argument for the defense
will be made by Attorney Robert Ferral,
and Assistant District Attorney Alford
will follow. The case, will be submitted
to the jury this afternoon.
Referring to Buckley's flight from the
scene of the murder, the speaker insisted
that was no proof of guilt. Jabez Swan
Jr., one of the witnesses for the prosecu
tion, admitted the shooting frightened
him so'that he went several blocks out of
his way to get to his home on Shotweil
I street. Had he been pursued he might
have been arrested for murder, and not
withstanding his innocence witnesses
might have been found to identify him
as the murderer of George Rice.
The attorney argued that Rice . was
clubbed Into insensibility and was uncon
scious when he was shot. It followed
therefore that his dying statement as to
the kind of hat worn by his assassin could
not be believed.~\ Sergeant Duke, who
took the dying. statement, was criticized
as having shown animus in his testimony.
Great stress was laid upon the remark of
an unknown man to the officer who ar
rested Buckley that "he was not the
man. Discrepancies were pointed out in
the testimony of "the sleuth hounds of the
police," and proved conclusively; accord
ing to the speaker, .that their statements
were not founded on fact. The fact that
no revolver was found on the person ! of
Buckley and the additional fact that none
was j ever discovered along the route fol
lowed by Buckley lir his rush for safety
was especially alluded to as an indication
of Buckley's innocence. The lack of mo
tive for the murder was advanced in sup
port of the theory of innocence of the de
fendant. . : Â¦ * - â¢ Â¦ v . ... ....
The speaker insisted that the testimony
of the defense proved that the man who
did the shooting not only wore a black
hat, but was of a dark complexion. Even
Rice himself on his dying bed said that ho
could not identify Buckley as his assas
sin. The witnesses for the defense were
reputable people, whose veracity was un
questioned, and all of them were positive
the assassin wore a black hat. Were the
witnesses for the prosecution to be be
lieved and those of the defense denied
credence? - â¢ - \-. <'
Assassin "Wore Black Hat.
. Contradictory Evidence in Case.
â¢The testimony of several of the wit
nesses for the defense was dissected at
length. By a singular coincidence all of
these observed that the assassin wore a
black hat, but none of them saw more
than two persons near Rice's body at tho
time of the shooting. One of these wit
nesses said the assassin ran first from the
scene of the shooting, while Buckley as
serted on the stand that he himself was
the first to run away. The speaker de
clared that the fabric reared by the de
fense was too frail and would not bear
analysis. ;Â¦
The facts tended, the attorney asserted,
to show that Buckley and his confeder
ates deliberately planned Rice's murder,
and that in defense the story of the two
strangers was manufactured; The day
had passed when men charged with crime
could secure immunity from punishment
by resorting to the old plea that, their
crimes were 'committed by strangers who
do not exist. The jury was asked/ to
weigh the evidence well, for to turn such
a man as Buckley loose would be an out
rage upon society. Then, turning to Buck
ley, the speaker extended his arm and in
a .voice trembling with excitement- ex
claimed: " v
"There, gentlemen, sits the murderer )of
George Rice!"
Buckley scowled and his face grew pale.
Dunne then concluded his argument with
the statement that only one. verdict and
only one penalty were possible in the case.
Attorney Frank J. Murphy argued 'for
the defense. He intimated that the prose
cution in the case was most unfair, and
expressed the belief that there was a hid
den force behind the prosecution which
prompted the employment of special coun
sel, when the regular counsel was ade
quate for all other purposes! The speaker
then alludedSto the testimony of Arthur
Cleve as being .unreliable because his
definition of an oath - was "to stick to
what you say." The lad denied â¢ that he
had made certain statements at the Cor
oner's inquest, notwithstanding his testi
mony, was taken down in shorthand by. a
competent stenographer.; All this tended
to prove that the testimony of the boy
Cleve, who positively identified Buckley
as the murderer, was absolutely unrelia-.
ble. The same was said of the testimony
of Erline Piatt, who said she attended
school every day of the week of the mur
der, although it was a fact that there wag
a school vacation for a week prior to the
assassination. Was it reasonable â¢ to ac
cept the testimony of such witnesses and
hang a human being thereon?
Dunne reviewed the circumstances at
tending Buckley's arrest while running
from the scene of the crime and of his
conflicting statements made to the police.
That many- of his statements were false
his own testimony showed. That he had a
motive in concealing the truth was also
apparent. Witnesses Piatt and Cleve both
positively identified Buckley as the mur
derer, because he was the man who clung
to the first stanchion of the car, because
he had a scratch on his right cheek and
because he wore a white hat, faded gray
clothes and yellow shoes. Buckley admit
ted having been wounded on the cheek by
a piece of wire on the day of the mur
der and that he held on to a stanchion on
the forward end of the car until Twen
tieth street was reached. \ *Â¦ .
The arguments In the Buckley ' murder
case attracted a large crowâ¢ to Judge
Lawlor'a courtroom yesterday. Among
the spectators were numerous union men
and others who are apparently deeply in
terested in the outcome of the case. . -.â¢â¢Â¦
The opening argument "was made by At
torney Peter F. Dunne, who reviewed the
facts of the case at length. He contended
that there was no doubt that Rice's deatn
was the result of a prearranged plan and
that the man who did the shooting was a
passenger on the Howard street car and
wore a light hat. Rice was confronted
with' Buckley twipe | within . twenty-four
hours after the shooting, and while thÂ«
dying man could not identify
Buckley as his assailant he was positive
that the man who did the shooting wore
a white hat. This Btatement is corrobo
rated by that of many witnesses, all of
whom agreed that the assassin wore a
light soft hat. â¢

weight and strength- EHiston, from. Tom
Stevens' stable, finished a moderate third.
There were but five starters.
Following *Mg came a five-furlong
sprint for three-year-olds, with a field of
seven going to the post. It looked a toss
up between Evander and Malaspina and
S to 5 was quoted against each. Evander
proved sturdiest in the stiff going, and
rushed to the front by Bullman, was not

lengths for t>i<Â» place by Bassenzo, ridden
by Burns.
JCellie Forest did not perform as a 9 to

the Magrane filly, but could never get her
among the leaders. Bunman, astride
Hilary, beat the gate, leading to the
stretch. Burns, with the 5 to 1 chance
Tibaron then assumed the front position,
scoring cleverly from Parsifal, a 15 to 1
outsider.

ihe lict that the cost to replace them isTiow

the trade toward a -conservative selling policy.

leeded in 16-oz. cartons. This, however, can
aot be confirmed at the moment. In loose rai

Butter, ' Cheese and Eggs.
On the Exchange Eggs were slapped down
2%o to 20c without much ceremony, and dealers
all along the street reported the market weak
and quiet, in spite of the comparatively light
stocks. The situation in a nutshe.ll Is that at
this time of the year the market is apt to break
sharply at a day's notice, as the output from
the ranches runs up very fast during the late
winter and early spring months, and dealers
dread being caught with large lines on their
floors. Hence the disposition is to give the fu
ture a liberal discount. Again, shipping orders
are small and receipts are much larger than
a fortnight ago, while there are already signs
of an accumulation in stocks.
'. The feeling in Cheese is reported steadier,
though there is plenty on the. market.
Butter shows no change. Stocks are moder
ate and the market is in very fair shape for
sellers, though a decline is expected along any
day. .-. . â¢ . Â¦

English Salmon Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. 6.â The stock market
showed considerable animation to-day and^thrf
dealings were much better distributed than,
for eeme time past. There were stocks which'
huag back and some which fell away on profit
taking after recent considerable advances, but
the general - tone of the market was strong,"
There was a feeling that the improved condi
tions, were due to some development .not gen
erally known and the professional traders., who
In fact did not know what they were, were:
among the largest buyers on the supposition
that others who did know were 'in the market
with them. These surmises had to do to a large
extent with possible developments In tne suit
against the Northern Securities Company. Con
fident expressions were heard, but on anony
mous authority, tHat the decision of the Su
preme Court- was made up against the admis
sion of the suit to argument. The supposi
tion also found expression that the -projectors
of the great merger have an alternative plan
to fall back on In case of the declared-illegal
ity of the present company.' It is argued that
a foreign corporation might hold the securi
ties of the United States corporations and be
outside the Jurisdiction of the United States
law. The reported formation of a leasing com
pany to control Metropolitan Street Railway on
& guarantee of the dividend was not of much
benefit to that 6tock. but ! the evidence thus
given of continued planning on the part of capi
tal toward development was an influence toward
epeculatio. A social gathering of millionaires
in Philadelphia was also made much of. espe
cially as men rated as antagonistic were re
ported to be present on affable terms. The im
portance attached to such unsubstantial con
jectures indicated the continued predominance
of professional operations in the market. The
traders also made much of the reduction in
the discount rate of the -Bank of England as
promising a relaxation of the pressure upon
New York for gold. Of the day's movements
In detail. Southern Pacific was largely In the
hands of the same speculative Interest which
has been dealing in it recently, and the move
ment in Pennsylvania was also attributed to
this operator. The Vanderbllts. as a group,
were all strong. Lake Erie and Western prefer
red showing a gain of 6 points. United States
Express made a further advance of 7% and
Third Avenue gained 7%. Proflt-taklns made
the closing somewhat Irregular, but the Inroads
upon prices were not extensive.
The bond market was active and broad and
showed general advances. Total sales, par
value, $4,555,000.

after the opening and speculators began to
change i front. A prominent trade . paper re
ported the growing plant* unusually suscepti

bullish effect. May. gradually sold up and
fluctuated very narrowly. There was some
fear that the market might be oversold, but
some advances In the outside markets and
a slightly better cash situation as indicated
by a better exoort business at the seaboard
probably- helped most In the late spurt. Re
ceipts were so limited â only one car to-day
that bulls began talking of tenacious holding
by first hands, but though there was some
effect from this factor, the reports that ship
ments would be good If cars could be had
neutralized- thla Influence. May at one time
was selling at 78% c 'and closed after another
dip, firm, %@%c higher, at 78%@78%c. Â¦ .

MACHINISTS .AND HANDY MEN TO KNOW
THAT . THE MACHINISTS' STRIKE IS
PRACTICALLY OVER.
ALL SHOPS RUNNING AS USUALj Â¦
The machinists' strike- that has been on In .the
principal Denver shops since October is now
practically broken, as the shops are running
with non-union men and only about 25 per cent
of the strikers remain In , town, walking the
streets. ' â¢ " s
The victory claimed by the strikers at the
Colorado Iron Works Company is 4n reality a
defeat. \ The men went out for a nine-hour day.
whereas this Is the very point not conceded by
the Colorado Iron Works Company. . A number
of tha old men from the Colorado Iron Works
Company were selected by the management and
offered Individually their old positions, if they
would work the hours per day stipulated by the
manufacturers, and conform to their shop
rules and regulations. Â¦'Â¦â¢:* . Â¦ .
. Mulberry, who is conducting the strike, op-
posed this and a stormy meeting: followed, un-
til the men demanded that they be allowed to]
return or withdraw from the union. To make
the appearance of a victory and prevent a loss
of more men, the union were obliged. to sanc-
tion the return of these men, hence the mis-
leading report In the daily papers.
This strike has demonstrated two things:
That the majority of first-class men are free
men and will not be bound by arbitrary unipns.
and that. the Denver Machinery Manufacturers
are organized as a unit to resist the unjust,
unreasonable, unbusinesslike and arbitrary de-
mands of organized labor.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Â« ,- 1118 Broadway, Feb. 6. -
From being kicked by a horse little
Leslie C. White, 5 "years of age, the son
of Mr. and Mrs. Leslie C. White, resid
ing on San Pablo avenue, near Fortieth
street, has lost his life.
The child was kicked, in the face by a
pet Shetland pony about Christmas. The
wound healed, [ apparently, 'in a couple
of weeks, and it was not until ten days
afterward that the injury showed signs
of having caused lockjaw. The parents
called in Dr. A. H. Pratt at that junc
ture, but the little sufferer's case had
passed the critical stage and was be
yond medical relief.
After, several days of intense agony,
during which the boy was unable to take
nourishment, either solid or liquid, death
relieved the youthful patient's sufferings.
The original injury had not seemed
very serious. Little Leslie had been play
ing near the pony when the pet suddenly
kicked, whether intentionally was not
discovered. The hoof struck the -child on
the side of the . face, cutting a gash
from the ear to the cheekbone.' It was
given home treatment and healed, to all
external appearances, in due time. The
boy was about and at play as usual.
Dr. Pratt said to-day:
When I was called In the child had shown
evidences of trouble for about ten days. The
case had developed into lockjaw, due, in all
probability, to poison germs that had/ got into
the wound when the child was kicked. It was
a clear case of tetanus, and all that could be
done was to relieve the lljtle one's sufferings
as much as possible. . There had been no evi
dence of the disease for two or three weeks
after the injury was inflicted. .
The funeral was held to-day, interment
being In Mountain View Cemetery. ;

. Icjury Which Was Ap

"- Legal Holiday. boats and trains will .run on
Sunday time. Â¦ .In many of the restaurants and meeting
places of Chinatown the discovery of the
fraud in Ma Foo's case was discussed last
night, and it is safe, to predict that the
members qf the gang that bribed young
Duffy will not be found when a search is
made for them by the Federal officials.
No amount of questioning could, elicit
any reply from the men in the store as
to what Pon Toy did for a living or where
he lived. Pon Sing, the reputed proprietor
of the place, would neither admit nor deny
that Pon Toy was employed there or was
known to him.
A few minutes later a Chinese, entered
the store and whispered to one of the men
behind the counter "to tell the white man
nothing" and then made a dive for the
street and disappeared in the holiday
crowd. i . v
When Pon Toy was told that he was in
danger of getting into trouble in connec
tion with Ma Foo's illegal landing, he
suddenly rushed from the store and bolted
down the street. â¢â¢ â¢ -
"Tell the White Man Nothing."
I .was in Stidger's office; this morning on
other business. ; I met Lee there and Lee paid
Stidger. $3 and asked him to dismiss the case
of. Ma* Foo. I -did- not go there with Lee â I
met him there by accident. I don't know why
Lee wanted the case of Ma Foo,, dismissed. I
don't know ' anything : about an uncle of Ma
Foo going to Sacramento.
Pon Toy denied that he had visited
Stidger's office yesterday, morning, as
claimed by the attorney, but changed his
mind on reflection and said:
When asked what the full name of Lee
was, the wily Chinese j could not remem
ber. He did not know where Lee lived,
but thought he could find him. .
I was In Stidger's office last week on some
business and I met a man named Lee there.
Lee wanted to employ Stidger to get a writ
of habeas corpus for Ma Foo.' I acted as in
terpreter for .Lee.
His explanation of his connection with
Stidger and Ma Foo was entirely differ
ent , to that made by Stidger and is as
follows: . .Â» . â¢ , - ' - .
Pon Toy, however, speaks English flu
ently an'd finally admitted that he was the
man sought for. He was asked if he
knew Stidger and denied any knowledge
of the. attorney, but on â¢Â¦ being informed
that he had been seen visiting Stidger's
office admitted having done. .business with
him.
Pon Toy, the Chinese mentioned by
Stidger, was located Â¦ last night In a'
butcher shop at the corner of Dupont and.-
Commercial streets. When he was asked
if his name was Pon Toy he denied being
the man and, like, all Chinese, pretended
to "no savee English." I
Stidger came into, prominence in con
nection with" the trial of the Ciprlco-Foss
gang of forgers of Chinese ' certificates.
Stidger was a deputy of the special agent
of the internal revenue, Bert Thomas, and
worked up the evidence against Ciprico
and his accomplices. At the trial of the
forgers, the attorneys for the defense ac
cused Stidger of being implicated in the
frauds and of turning State's evidence.
Stidger remained in the Government'serv
ice until 1896, when he resigned Â¦ his posi
tion, securing the best of testimonials
from his former superiors in the Govern
ment service. > . â¢
Pon Toy Contradicts Lawyer.
Well, it was this way: Pon Toy came to
me this morning and gave me $3 and told me
that one of the uncles of Ma Foo, who was
to appear as a witness in the case, had gone
to Sacramento for the Chinese New Year fes
tivities and it was uncertain when he would
ness Pon .Toy said that he wanted the case
dismissed and he and those he represented
would consent -to Ma Foo being returned to
China. I thought the request was an unusual
one, but 1 1 did as requested. The $i was to
pay the fee of dismissing the habeas corpus
case. When I asked that the case be dis
missed the District Attorney's office would not
consent and had It go over until next- Mon
day. I told Pon Toy of this and informed him
that he would have to be present and pay the
costs, amounting to about $10. He seemed
perfectly satisfied. . â¢ .
Stidger is persona non grata with the
officials of the i Chinese bureau. Some
weeks ago Chief Dunn of the Chinese bu
reau refused to allow Stidger to enter the
office or see any of the- papers, charging
him with not complying with the rules of
the department. Stidger in return accused
Dunn of unfair treatment and filed com
plaint with the Secretary of the Treasury.
Dunn is now in Washington and the Seer
retary of the Treasury has the affair un
der consideration. .
'Stidger. was asked why he had gone be
fore Commissioner Heacock. requested
that official to dismiss the habeas corpus
proceedings in Ma Foo's case and con
sented-to his client being remanded back
to China. He said: . *
I ; was - employed by Pon Toy to secure the
writ of habeas corpua for Ma Foo. Pon Toy
is a . well-known merchant in Chinatown. I
had no dealings with . any other Chinese in
this case. Pon Toy acted as Interpreter â¢ for
the friends 'of Ma Foo. I looked' to Pon Toy
for payment of my fees. I have not seen Ma
Foo at any time and I know nothing of the
substitution of another man in his place.
Attorney O. H P. Stidger, who applied for
the writ of habeas corpus In the. case of
Ma Foo, was seen last evening and asked
as to his connection with the case., Stidger
made the. following statement: . >

The officials of the Chinese Bureau
stated yesterday that they were not re
sponsible for the substitution of an old
man for- the real Ma Foo. They explained
that thetr- duty ended when they had ex

and had'; passed on â¢ the cases, and that

By absolute chance, and not on account

showing "that there is little difficulty for
to enter this country in defiance
of all the laws.

cific offense of which Duffy is accused is
the substitution -of an old Chinese, name
VT.^no-Kn. for Ma Foo, an Oriental, aged
35 years, who sought to enter \his country
in \ransit to Mexico. :.
The investigations made yesterday by

a'^Kir* has existed in the handling of Chi

Deputy Eurnham Detects Scheme.
To DÂ« puty United States Marshal Burn
â¢ ham belongs the <redit of being the rirst
to get an inkling of a new scheme,
listened fcy Chinese and presumably as-
Eisted by white men. to" secure landing
lor thtir friends from the Orient.'
In Ju'y of last year when the steamship
Coptic arrived here from Hongkong she
had on board Ma Foo, a Chisiese. who
;;: Kid to be allowed tq land and proceed
in transit through the United States to
MoJiieo-
With hur.dredp of his countrymen. Ma
Foo was placed in the detention sheds of
the Pacific Mail Company at Second and
Krsnr.an streets, and the expensive ma
chinery of Uncle Sam's Government was
kept at work in order that Ma Foo might
r.ot slip unforbidden into the greatest re
public of all times~
The officials of the Chinese bureau duly
photographed Ma Foo and put h,m
through an examination, but. they were
not satisfied that he was telling the truth
as to his desire to go to Mexico. On the
recommendation of the bureau the Col
lector of the Port denied landing to Ma
Foo. Â¦ Â¦
Although the action of the Collector of
the port took place some months ago, the
Pacific Mail Company did notreturn Ma
Foo to China, as it should have done. In
the quarters of the "Hotel Mongolia" on
ine Mail dock Ma Foo spent many weary
rfays listening to the roar of the traffic of
the city* to which he was denied admls
fiin. . ,
Many of the steamers of the Pacific
Mail Company have departed for the
Oriont since the time that Ma Foo was
ordpred by the Collector of the Port to be
returned to China, but still the slant-eyed
prisoner was? kept In durance.
In a manner known to the Chinese word
Â¦was sent to the city's unsavory Oriental
district that Ma Foo pined for the Chinese
lily and the sweetmeats of*the new year
in preference to the bill of fare of the
"Hotel Mongolia" or a return trip to the
land of the Boxer.
Last Thursday Attorney O. P. Stidger
was retained by friends of Ma Foo to se
cure a writ of habeas corpus for him. on
the cround that he was a native born
American and was being deprived of his
liberty by the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company.
On Friday last Stldgrer applied for the
writ and Judge de Haven ordered the
Mail Company to produce Ma Foo in
court.
When the paperakwere served on the of
ficials of the Malr Company orders were
given at the Mall dock . for the Chinese
in cjuestion to be turned over to the Fed
eral officials.
Ha Foo CliaDged Into Old Man.
"With a show of bravery. Ma Foo jcame
from his dingy bunk in the detention
Fheds and was turned over to John Duuy,
the driver for Crichton, who hauls freight
for the Mail Company, and also hauls the
Chinese to and from the dock and the
courts of justice.
Duffy is 20 years of age and has a cun
ning face. When he received orders to
haul lla Foo to the Federal building and
turn him over to the 'United. States Mar
shal it was part of his work to convey
the Mongolian to a photographic gallery
and have him photographed, in order mat
Ma Foo's picture might be affixed to the
papers in the writ of habeas corpus.
Duffy took Ma Foo to Brown's gallery
in Chinatown, and while there Deputy
United States Marshal Burnham entered
the gallery in order to have a Chinese
woman photographed. Burnham saw
Dulfy and Ma Foo and heard the young
driver give the name of the Chinese to
the clerk of the gallery.
Tfcen Burnham saw Duffy depart with
his charge, presumably to deliver him
over to Marsha! Shine.
Two hours later Burriham returned to
the Marshal's office in the Federal build-
Ing. He happened to look into the deten
tion room and saw an aged Chinese sit
ting there.
"Who is that old fellow?" asked Burn
nam of Chief Deputy Farish. .
"He If Ma Foo," replied Farish. "He
has applied for a writ of habeas corpus
on the ground of being a native born
American and wants to go to Mexico."
Duffy Certainly Is a "Wiz."
Burnham was dumfounded when ne

Tax Collector Smith discovered yester
day that the prospective delinquency in the
collection of taxes due the city and State
for the fiscal year 1901-1902 will cause a
deficit of more ' than $100,000 in the city's
funds. , Â¦ , . jp Â¦â¢:,â¢,
Should Smith's calculations, prove to be
correct lt'.wiU"necessitate a rearrange
ment of the various funds of the last tax
budget adopted by the Board of Super
visors to .'conform Â¦ to the -^reduction :in
revenue. When the appropriations were
made they were based on a total assessed
valuation of $400,000,000, but when Assessor
Dodge reported an increased valuation of
$8,000,000, additional appropriations were
made corresponding to . the taxes that
would be raised on the difference. -
Tax, Collector Smith has compiled, a
statement Showing' that there will be an
estimated 'deficiency of nearly $200,000 in
tax collections when the annual .settle
ment Is made next July. About one-third
of this amount will be borne by the State,
but the rest will be the city's: loss. The
deficiency represents the taxes on an as
sessment of about $12,000,000, showing that
the-tax budget. waSvbased on too high a
valuation by the sum named. The state

SEES A DEFICIT
IN CITY'S FUNDS
The Mall Company was ordered to bring Ma
Foo into, court. -.The Mail Company instructed
one of its employes to bring Ma Foo to the
Marshal's office. This employe brought an
other man, but we were not to know of that.
AVe could not go down to the Mall Dock and
pick out any particular Chinese from the de
tention sheds. I don't know who is to blame
in this matter, Â¦ but it certainly is not on this
office.; We had a man turned over to us as
Ma Foo and his photograph was attached to the
writ; of. habeas' corpus. That man we have In
custody, and', thet-e our responsibility ends.
Chief Deputy A. L. Farish, who has
served in the office for many years, said:
We take 1 every precaution - to prevent any
fraud on the part of the Chinese who pass
through our hands. When a Chinese is turned
over to us on a writ of habeas corpus. "I. al
ways affix the photograph of the man to the
papers in the case and do eo in the presence
of the representative of the transportation
company that has charge of the Chinese. Then
I make the man in charge of the Chinese affix
his signature to the photograph. It is not our
duty to go. to the Mail dock or any other place
to secure the body of a person ordered into
court on a writ of habeas corpus. The court
orders certain parties to produce the body of
the detained person ''in- court. In this, case of
Ma.Foo,- the court ordered the Pacific Mail
Company to produce Ma Foo In the United
States, District Court. It has been held that
turning the body of the person so ordered into
court over to the Marshal is a compliance with
the law. \ Â¦ Â¦â¢ > -..
which the Chinese' could -evade the ex
clusion laws. . ' .â¢ ..... .
Commissioner Heacock had . been / in
formed of the fraud in the case and, at
the request of Assistant District Attorney
Mc.Kinlay. continued the cas.e . until next
Monday afternoon. . "
In the meantime deputy marshals had
been to the Mail dock and placed Duffy,
under arrest. Duffy -was taken before
Commissioner Heacock by. Marshal- ShinV
and charged with aidingr and abetting in
the illegal landing of the real Ma Foo.
who is being sought by the United States
Marshal." Duffy was instructed. as ta his
rights and the hearing of his case was
set for Tuesday next at' 10 : a. m. .Bail
was fixed at $1500 and Duffy was . remand
ed into the custody of Marshal Shine:
Duffy telephoned to his employer to
bail him out, but as no bond was forth
coming the prisoner was '.taken to the
County Jail and locked up. â¢ :.' ..
When asked by. a Call representative
what he knew of the substitution of â¢ an
old man for the young MaFoo Duffy
leered and refused to give' any informa
tion.
"I won't tell you my name or where I
saw that Duffy had presented an old man
to the Marshal in place of the young Ma
Foo. The photogTaph attached to â¢ the
writ of habeas corpus was that of the
old man and Duffy had certified to it as
being that of Ma Foo, whom he had
taken from the Mail dock detention sheds
in obedience to the writ, of habeas corpus.
The matter was reported to. United
States District Attorney Woodworth- and
orders were gi\Â»en to try to round up the
real Ma Foo, while the old man substi
tuted for him was sent to the County
Jail'.
Yesterday afternoon Attorney Stidger
appeared before Commissioner Heacock
and asked that the writ of habeas corpus
in the case of Ma Foo be dismissed !and
consented to "Ma Fob" being sent back
to China. . . . .

I have tried about 150 habeas corpus cases
of Chinese in the 'past year and about sixteen.
I. thought that the Chinese 'had' exhausted
their plans to evade the law, but it seems that
I have been mistaken. The substitution of a
Â¦Chinese for another who applies for a writ of
habeas corpus seems in this case' to have been
s. simple matter. The substituted i man has
never been brought before me and if I had
consented to the application of the attorney
in the case, the writ would have" been dismiss
ed and "Ma Foo" would have been sent back
to China. Of course we would 'have been en
tirely . ignorant of the fact that the .real Ma
Foo *had -made his escape and that an old. de
crepit man. who evidently wants to. go home
to China, would have done so without any ex
prnso to himself. . , â¢-- . . *
This Is one of the .most daring "frauds ever
perpetrated on the Government, and we will
probe the matter to the end. We will try to
catch the real Ma Foo and as we have the
old man substituted 'for him and also the
driver. Duffy, we hope to get the , rest of the
gang implicated. : Â¦Â¦/â¢ : .; Â¦ Â¦
Commissioner Heacock, who hears the
evidence in all Chinese "habeas Â¦ corpus
cases, 'said yesterday: â¢â¢-.. ,
When Duffy was asked to tell who had
helped him in the substitution of the Chi
nese he declined to give any answer. '
-United States District Attorney Wood
worth said yesterday: . Â¦
live," said Duffy in a surly manner, "and
if I have to be punished I guess I will
be the one to suffer."
