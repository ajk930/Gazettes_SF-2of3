$ Senator Morgan sent to all "members of
the Senate Interoceanic Canal Committee
to-day the draft of a report that he has
made supporting- the Nicaragua canal bill.
Senator* Hanna will draw, a minority re
port arid there; will be a lively time at
the next meeting of the committee. Sen
ator Hanna said to-day that there was
not^much prospect of the Panama route
prevailing in the committee. Several of
the' Senators who are wedded to the Nica
rauga route are very bitter against, the
French offer. Senator t Hawley of Con
necticut, who is a member of the com
mittee,-says that the Panama canal is
simply, carrion from the bones of which
the crows nave picked all the flesh.*
But what the President does not want
to see is a deadlock between Panama and
Nicaragua. He knows that there are cer
tain' influences at work to brine about
sufch a result. He hopes that they will
be defeated. He will do nothing that can
be construed Into taking sides with either
faction and his influence will be in the
direction of action not delay.
The President does not think Congress
ought to throw the selection of the route
on him. He would doubtless meet the re
sponsibility if he had to, but he believes
that the selection of the route is some-,
thing that belongs to Congress. At the
same time those who havf an opportunity
of talking with the President on this sub
ject are. convinced .that the . desire of
Roosevelt for canal action is so genuine
that he would take the burden of ffxing
the route if he could not get legislation
otherwise. . â¢
Hence he is not a "Panama man" in
the sense that Senator Depew is. His po
sition is that if it cannot be Panama it
must be Nicaragua. He has no sympathy
with extremists, who on one side are for
Nicaragua or nothing, and 'on the other
for Panama or nothing. So eager is he
for the beginning of work that he would
welcome a bill for a route that he does
not consider the best rather than have
the matter "thrown over to a. future ses
sion of Congress. He takes this position
because he thinks that on both routes a
canal can be constructed and operated
within the limits of the estimates, and
if . prejudice against Panama should be
insurmountable he does not want that
fact to stand in the way of the United
States going ahead with this great 'work
by way of Nicaragua.

W.. WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.â President
Roosevelt has been asked to take sides In
the struggle in Congress over the route
for the proposed isthmian canal. He la
not likely to do so,' but^ his position on
this question can be accurately stated be
cause he has made It clear In conversa
tions with Senators and others. The Pres
ident earnestly hopes for canal legisla
tion. He does not want Congress to ad
journ without passing a bill authorizing
the beginning of work. He thinks the
time has come when the first step should
be taken and that there - Is no call for
further delay and examination. He has
his own ideas as to the best route and
unquestionably thinks that Panama offers
the best _ advantage. â At . the_ same, time
her understands the anxiety of ,a ma-
JorJty..of $he interoceanic canal commit-,
tee lest -the Panama offer should, when
too late, be discovered to be Inadequate

THE police have at last found a

who were implicated with Jack
Wade, alias Henderson, in the
brutal murder of Policeman Robinson.
It was definitely settled yesterday, that
the two criminals succeeded in . making
good their escape from the city last
Wednesday afternoon on the Sunset Lim

BIotstl Away and Fans and
OSKALOOSA, Iowa, Jan. 24.â The Lost
Creek coal mine was the scene to-day of
a terrible disaster, which cost the lives of
twenty-one miners. K Eight others were
seriously injured. The bodies of the dead
men were recovered from the mine, and
lie to-night in an improvised morgue near
the scene of their destruction. The in
jured, all of whom are frightfully cut and
bruised and burned, are under the care of
surgeons in a temporary hospital equipped
near the mine.

Burned and Mutilated. '
The Lost Creek mine Is ten miles south
east of Oskaloosa and three miles north of
Eddyvllle. The explosion occurred at the
noon hour and was what is known s as a
dust explosion. The miners had just fired
their usual noon shots, one of which
proved to be a fizzle, the powder flame ig
niting the gas and causing the explosion.
Emoke and debris were blown out of the
mine In a column 200 feet high. A part of
the top works was torn away and the fans
and the cages were wrecked. This made
the work of rescue very slow, and it was
S o'clock before volunteer parties dared to
venture Into the east entry, where the ex
plosion occurred. The men of the rescue
party fought their way into the mine,
Â¦wbere a -shocking sight met their gaze.
The dead and injured were terribly burned
and mutilated, some of them almost be
yond recognition. Beyond where the
bodies lay the fire was burning fiercely
and for a time It was feared that the
workings would be wholly destroyed and
the bodies Incinerated.
Flames Subdued, Bodies Carried Out.
Finally, however, the flames were sub
dued. The bodies were then collected and
carried to the top of the shaft.
At the time of the explosion more than
100 men were in the mine, but all except
those who were in the east entry escaped
with only slight injury.
The' total property damage will be about
$10,000. :/./.
It was nearly 6 o'clock this evening
when the last of the dead was taken out,
and the scenes of anguish among the fam
ilies of the â¢victims were most pitiful.
Nearly all of the men were married and
leave families in poor circumstances. % !
thorities of all the southern towns in the
hope of Intercepting the fugitives.
In making their escape from the city
"Kid" Goucher and "Brownie" secreted
themselves on the stairs under the trap
door located in each end of a Pullman
car and with their bodies doubled up like
jackknives they rode safely out of the
reach of the detectives who have striven
vainly to hunt' them down.
It was a, bold scheme. Nobody but a
fugitive from Justice, â¢ driven to the last
peg of sheer desperation, would attempt
such a ride. The limited train upon which
the murderers made, their escape did not
make a single stop until it reached San
Jose, so the men have at least put fifty
miles or more between them and.. the
scene , of their terrible crime.
Switchman Identified Them.
About 3:45 o'clock Wednesday afternoon
one of the switchmen at Fifth and Town
send streets noticed a pair of hard-look-,
ing characters skulking, around the rail
road tracks. He paid little attention to
them at first, until one- of the 'men ac- !
costed him and asked him If he thought
himself and his, partner could catch the
Sunset limited as it sped by Fifth street
on Its way out. The switchman eyed the
pair keenly and then informed them that
they had better not try to . board the
train as it passed Fifth street, because
at that point the -limited fairly flew along
the track. "If you are good railroad
men," . said the switchman, "you 'might
make it, but if you don't know the game
you had better not try."
The switchman took particular pains to
notice the general make-up of the two
men, because It was an unusual question
they had asked. The two criminals an
swered the description, of "Kid" Goucher
and "Brownie" in every detail. They .were
attired in" the same clothes they wore on
the night they murdered Robinson, except
that both had . discarded their overcoats.
After leaving- the .switchman the men
whom the police ,' are convinced are
Goucher and "Brownie" walked over be
hind the freight sheds. They wore a
hunted look and shifted their eyes up and
down the yard as they walked, toward
the sheds. When the limited pulled out of
the depot the yardmaster saw both , of
them on the steps under the trap door.
The smaller man, Goucher, was on the
front step and the man -who answers the
description of "Brownie" was doubled'up
under the trap at the rear end of the Pull
man. - â¢ - â¢ Â¦ v ?-' -â¢ â¢ ' Â¦ :
The accurate descriptions given by both
the yardmaster and the switchman, ' who
had quite a conversation with the pair,
and the fact that they, took, such an un
comfortable and desperate method of
stealing a ride have brought Captain Sey"
mour and his men tp the .conclusion that
the much wanted pair are. now speeding
toward Mexico. The Sunset Limited goed
through El Paso, Texas,! and from .there
it -would be an easy matter fortheimur
derers to get over the Mexican border.
As soon as. Captain Seymour received
the "tip" that two men had skipped out
on the Wednesday afternoon limited train
to the south he detailed Detectives Wren
and Dinan to go at once to the' depot "and
Detectives on Their Trail.

by their locomotive engineers and other em

of passengers, and. they have failed to 'remedy
said conditions;-, and also for the reason that
certain improvements in the way of both visi

and for the further reason that no regulation

Nelson came here from Portland. Or.,
the latter part of last year, , after having
been ffriven away from there by the po
| lice, who knew him as a thug. En route
tothis city he made the acquaintanceship
of Davis and they formed a partnership
for the purpose of relieving after-dark
strollers of their valuables. Luckily ; for
the residents of this city their first at
tempt to secure wealth without labor end
ed disastrously. They commenced' opera
tions by holding up Otto Flelssner, organ
ist of the First Presbyterian Church, and
Rex Hamlin, the sexton, on Van Ness ave
nue, near Jackson" street, one last
November. As Flelssner and Hamlin were
passing a doorway on the avenue Davis
stepped out and, pointing a revolver at
them, : ordered them to throw, up their
hands. Hamlin Â¦ dldi as he was told, but
Fleissner ran off and -made his escape.
Nelson, who had remained in the doorway
now stepped out and searched Hamlin's
pockets, getting $2 and a bunch. of keys.

The matter was reported to the police

Market- street. He was captured while
trying, to escape. His conviction followed
rapidly. ,The sentence of yesterday is the
maximum .penalty for grand larceny al
lowed by the law.
Edward Davis, his partner In crime, will
be sentenced to-day, and it . is â¢ probable
that his sentence will be. greater than that

martial there for larceny and convicted.
He served a term . at Aicatraz and was

The crime for which he was sentenced
to life imprisonment yesterday was the
robbing of Philip Krell, a showcase man

He presented a revolver at Krell's head
and quickly seized his watch and chain.

brought into police headquarters and
there exhibited to the squads of patrol

Favors Round-Tip of Criminals.
-"In regard to the number of criminals
row in the city, I think that is the natural
result of driftinsr to California, and to
San Francisco during the winter. It nas
been suggested often of late that the
criminal element has been largely ln
creased by the discharged soldiers. It is
true that a certain percentage of dis
charged soldiers have drifted into this
class, but the majority of the criminals
with which the Police Department has
come into contact. are the old. familiar
faces we have seen before. '
"There is no question in my mind of the
desirability of an increase in the police
force. Ever since I. became a Police Com
missioner I have realized that the city has
outgrown its police force and that In the
outlying districts the beats are too Ions.
In all cases the hours are too long. Tile
patrolman should have an adequate rest
and an opportunity to go on duty
thoroughly refreshed from the fatigue of
the previous watch. No man can do good
work on short sleeping hours. In other
words, I thoroughly believe in the eight
hour system for the police as soon as we
can get sufficient men to put it Into ef
fect.
George A. Newhall, president of the
Board of Police Commissioners, gave the
following interview:
"I am very glad that the courts are tak
ing this view of the situation, and I am
convinced that in a very few days you
will be able to notice a decrease in
crime." .
- Heavy Sentences the Remedy.
CaptXa. of Detectives Seymour said:
"The remedy now being applied by the
courts is the proper medicine for this epi
demic of crime. To-day one footpad has
been given twenty-seven years anrt
another has received a sentence of life
imprisonment. â¢ Criminals will not stay
where such sentences are being imposed.
"No fault can be found with such sen
tences. They are perfectly just, particu
larly-in cases where there have been prior
convictions. A life sentence is not ex
cessive punishment for the man with a
criminal record who goes out to hold up
citizens, for he will not hesitate to taKe
life if resistance is offered. The only
way Is to let them .understand that they
cannot do such business* here. (Â¦Â¦
"I am perfectly is accord with the views
expressed in the editorial in The Call this
morning. A police officer cannot patrol
from thirty to thirty-nve blocks, as some
of our men have to do before they have
covered their beats, and prevent the oc
currence of crime within the territory for
which he is responsible. No reasonable
man can expect an arrest for every crime
committed under conditions that. place a
force at such a disadvantage. The patrol
men are on duty for an excessive length
of. time. each day.. Only yesterday I was
compelled to add another hour to their
dally service. : The men are no won -duty
ten hours per day instead of eight. I They
accept 'the situation cheerfully, and no
complaints are Â» heard. The men are ' a"
willing lot. I served as a patrolman and
know what it means, and I appreciate
the uncomplaining and cheerful. manner
in which the men respond to extra de
mands upon them at a time such as this.
And their efficiency is shown by the fact
that during the past two months the pro
portion of arrests to the total number of
crimes committed 1 has been greater than
ever before in the. history of San Fran
cisco." -. . . . ....
"While crime is rampant now the per
centage of crime in which no arrests are
made is not large. During the last two
months there have been more arrests, for
felonies than ever before during the same
length of time. The County Jail is full
to overflowing. How did those men get
sentences except through arrest and upon
evidence furnished by the Police Depart
ment?. There have been many cases of
highway robbery, but also there have been
many arrests, and lately extreme sen
tences are being given this class of crim
inals. . i
until July, since the appropriation does
not provide for more men than. are now
doing duty. There is no question In my
mind that the new levy should provide
for -a very considerable increase of the
police force. - I am not prepared to say,
however, that the situation ia so serious
that the emergency fund or other funds
at the disposal of the Mayor or the Su
pervisors . should be drawn upon to pro
vide an immediate increase of the num
ber of patrolmen. -. i
"The police force cannot be regularly
increased until the beginning of the next
fiscal year in July. It certainly ought to
be largely increased under the new ap
propriation, possibly to the limit fixed by
the charter. I intend to inquire of tho
Auditor whether there is any fund in
which there is a surplus that may be
transferred in this emergency and used
for a temporary increase of the force. If
it is possible to add a few patrolmen to
the force by this means I shall advocate
doing so.
Â¦ "I shall encourage also a policy of
rounding up all known criminals and by
wholesale arrests on any sort of charges
making the city too hot to hold them.
That is a method often followed at such
times, and It is much better than wait
injEr for them to hatch their plots, for once
.their minds are made up to take a chance
any number of policemen that It Is pos
sible to place on duty cannot prevent
them."
"Rigorous punishment by the courts al
ways acts as a brake on crime, and I ap
prove of the sort of sentences that Â¦were
visited upon two offenders to-day.
"Discharged soldiers contribute an ele
ment to the crime of the city, though I
am not prepared to say that- It is very
great. The footpad who got a life sen
tence to-day was, I believe, a discharged
soldier. . â¢ - .. -
"In summer, , again, plenty of work is
to be had in tha country, and many who
have led an aimless existence and made
a living without too much exertion come
back to the city, and when they begin to
be pressed by the harder conditions of a
winter, even such as ours, in the city
they turn to crime and take a chance at
holding up some belated citizen.
"The Influx of criminals to Alaska dur
ing the summer and their return to ' the
States during the winter has its effect
on the amount of crime committed during
this season, particularly just now, when
Seattle has carried on a crusade against,
vice that has driven many of them away
from that city to find refuge here.
Rigorous Punishment a Brake.
"Public poker games, I believe, add
much to the total of' San Francisco
crime. Many jobs are put up In these
places, -which become places of ren
dezvous for criminals. The police have
frequently raided these resort3 and every
effort has been made to suppress them,
but acquittals nearly always result. It
seems almost Impossible to secure con
victions, although in my opinion they
are run in plain violation of the law. The
Police Department is certainly doing its*
duty In this respect. We are not in a po
sition just now to do more than we are
doing.
"The late strike and the_sa? still on
have resulted in bringing in an undesir
able element that has much to with tne
present frequency -of crime. The two
great iron works, particularly, have not
hesitated to bring in men of whom they
knew nothing. Some of these cared only
to get a trip to the coast. They have
been found incompetent and discharged
Away from home and with no means of
support, and in some cases with- criminal
instincts and records, they have turned
naturally to crime.
"I do not believe that the present epi
demic of hold-ups is more serious than
have occurred in former years. Indeed I_
believe that in 1887 and 1388 the evil was
greater than it is now. Great effort was!"
made then to suppress It- One. footpad,
I remember, was killed In the Western
Addition.
. "I do not pretend to say that any
change or Increase In the department
would stop crime, for the deeds of foot
pads cannot be stopped in communities
Infested by them unless a policeman is
stationed on every corner. We can never
have a force large enough in San Fran
cisco to prevent hold-ups at the times
when the town Is overrun with the crim
inal element. The -murder of poor .uoo
lnson was the result of an attempted
hold-up when a policeman was on the
same block and another within hailing
distance. If the highwayman is willing
to take the chance the city cannot be
well enough patrolled to stop him. The
only way is to drive him out of town or
to give the captured ones sentences that
will terrorize those still at liberty.
"There Is no question that the criminal
element of the United States tends to
drift to San Francisco during the winter
months. The experience of years ha3
taught us that. The reason is mainly
climatic; but I have no doubt that winter
racing here has a great deal of influence.
There Is always an undesirable element
that frequents the racetrack and hangs
about the cities where racing is in vogue.

"It is my opinion that the present forca
would be equally or more efficient under
the eight-hour system. I believe that the

About an hour after the i shooting a

drunk on Seventeenth street, near Valen

Chief of Police by Sergeant John C.
Ayers. a street sweeper gave the officers
the first knowledge of the finding- of
Pedro's body. Sergeant Ayers said:
"About 3:45 a. m. a street sweeper in
formed Officer Folsom on the corner of
Sixteenth, and Valencia streets that. there
was a man lying near Valencia and Seven
teenth streets drunk. Officer Folsom and
myself -went up . there and found a man
lying there. We awoke Dr.* D. F. Sulli
van, who lives two doors above, when we
found him. He came out and examined
him and said that the man was dead. I
telephoned to Lieutenant Anderson and
hs telephoned for the Coroner. The dep
uty came out and took charge of the
body, examined it and found a shot in
the back. I found Officer Crackbon on
thj corner of Seventeenth â¢ and Mission
streets and took- him up to where the
body was lying and from the description
he thought that he I was the man he
(Crackbon) shot at about two hours be
fore on Sixteenth' street, above ; Mission,
who escaped from him. ' â¢ ' ,
"A Mathews, 44 I^exington avenue, said
his name was Joe Pedro.' a brother of A.

. Pedro's body, was taken to the Morgue
by Deputy Coroner Fennell. When the
body was searched the officials found a
silver watch. and gold plated locket.- in
the. case of the watch was a photo
graph of his little child. A badge
"of- the League of the Sacred Heart
was taken from the lapel of bis coat. -In
his pockets two keys and. $29 50 in silver
were found. His pockets also contained
an order for 1000 brick, signed by-Thonias
W. Butcher, and. bearing the number 114,
and a receipt In the following.words:
"Received from J. Pedrb 59 on the 22d

"He backed away from me into the
street and I followed him. As soon as
he jaw that I intended to press him he
put his hand on his right hip pocket: 1
had 'my pistol in the outside pocket pf
my overcoat and had my right hand on
it and drew it out and covered him and
told him to take his hand off that, think
ing he was about to draw a pistol. He
then ran away in a low, stooping position
with his hand still on his hip pocket. He
ran up Sixteenth street toward Hoff ave
nue and I kept ordering him to stop. He
paid no attention to my command to stop
and just before he reached Hoff avenue
I fired a shot at him and he turned into
Hoff avenue and . ran toward Seventeenth
street and disappeared. I made a search
of the -yards on .Hoff avenue, thinking
he might be in hiding, but failed to catch
or locate him. I kept blowing my whistle
while chasing him. The time I fired at
him ,was about between 2:30 and 3 a. m.
I made a diligent search for him and
failed to find him. About an hour and a
half later he was found dead. on Seven
teenth street above Valencia by, a street
sweeper." . ; . . . ;
, . Sh-ootingr a Mistake.
Pedro's. death was due to a lamentable
mistake. There Is no doubt in the minds
of the Police Department that Pedro was
responsible for his own death. He was
a stranger in the city and was wandering
around in search of his temporary abid
ing place, which was with Mrs. Edward
Henry, who lives at 2911 Sixteenth street
While walking down Sixteenth street he
was accosted by Policeman Crackbon,
who was in citizen's clothes. Believing
the latter to be a footpad, Pedro backed
away and when the officer pulled" out his
pistol he became fear-stricken and took
to his heels. i
Crackbon called to him repeatedly to
halt and yelled that he was an officer,
but Pedro either did Tiot hear him or paid
no attention to his commands. The police
man then fired the fatal shot. According
to his statement he aimed low and shot
to bring the runner to a standstill. The
bullet struck the sidewalk and was de
flected upward, striking Pedro In the
body. Despite the mortal wound the man
ran on and fell prostrate more than- a
block and .a half .away on Seventeenth
ttreet; near Valencia. , >
Thought Pedro Had Gun.
toward Mission street. I stepped out in
plain view of him and ,when he saw me
he stopped and asked me where Sixteenth
street between Mission and Howard was.
J asked him- what number -and he replied
No. 1911. I told him I was a police officer,
showed him my star and told him he did
not live at any such number on Sixteenth

POLICEMAN SHOOTS CITIZEN.
A TRAGEDY in the home of. "Ed
die" Graney was narrowly avert
ed Thursday night by the rare
presence of mind of the head of
the household. Graney, who is
prominent in political circles, is very
fond of tamales. Thursday evening
he attended a performance at one of the
local theaters, accompanied by his wife.
They returned to their oozy little fiat at
1526 McAllister street late at night.
Graney decided that a couple of tamales
would be palatable before retiring and
suggested that he should send for them.
He. rang up the corner grocery.' and In
less than five minutes a young man; had
brought the toothsome' morsels to?.: the
house. On leaving, however, the young
man neglected to close '.-"the .front icfoor;
Mr. and Mrs. Graney retired -utterly .un
conscious of the fright that -was in store
for them. ... P. -,;:.-.
Dr. A. , D. McLean Is- the next: door
neighbor to Graney and on coming home
about 2 o'clock and seeing the front door
As soon as the men were Ironed and
placed In the patrol wagon the police
made a search of their rooms. A num
ber of copies of morning papers of recent
issue containing accounts of hold-ups
and the Robinson murder were found in
the bureau drawers. There was also a
collection of packages of court-plaster,
which some of them offered for sale as a.
guise to gain admittance to houses.
Just Â¦what the result of the raid may
be the police were disinclined to discuss
They think that these men know the
whereabouts of these concerned In the
Robinson murder, and to-day they will
be put through the sweating process. In
the meanwhile their names have been
placed on the small book until it Is de
termined what charge shall be placed
against them.
These men later gave the names of Jo
seph and Robert Walters. T[-he former in
endeavoring to escape jumped through a
skylight and was cut, but not severely.
His brother Robert, who is 17 years of
age. and has been In jail a number of
times, was disposed to make a fight, but
"VVfcitaker yelled to McMahon to use his
pistol quickly and the boy at once threw
up his hands. They were bundled into
the waiting patrol wagon.
In the meanwhile the other officers
rounded up those in the house and se
cured six more, all of whom have records
as thieves and vagrants. Those arrested
were: Joseph Walters,. Robert Walters,
James Walters, George Fagan, Harry
Young, Julius Smith, George Aristlde and
Frank Thompson. The latter is a "lav
ender seed" peddler and has but one leg.
He is considered one of the most cun
ning of the gang.
The police arrived at the place about il
o'clock and found eight men there. Two
of them made a break for liberty anl
jumped over a rear fence, then ran
through a basement and endeavored to
escape into JCatoma street. Detectives
Whitaker and McMahon made a search
for them and found them hiding in the
corner of a cellar. They ordered them to
throw up their hands. At the sight of
the officers' pistols both surrendered. -
In following up the clews furnished the
police, this place came under suspicion.
Mrs. Dooley says that two men rented the
room two weeks ago and were engaged in
peddling. She knows that the men were
peddlers, for she says that she bought
oranges from them. Soon after they took
her rooms, which consist of a bedroom
and kitchen on the tirst floor, .men began
coming at all hours of the day arid night.
She professed last night to the detectives
that she knew nothing about her lodgers,
but was somewhat surprised at the hours
they kept.
Sergeant Donovan was in charge of the
posse and was assisted by Officer George
Barry and Detectives Coleman, Whitaker,
Reynolds, Baily and Mc-Mahon. The house
occupied by Mrs. Dooley has an exit on
Katoma. street, and while their associates
went to the front door, " Whitaker and
McMahon covered the rear. Two of the
men tried to escape by this route, but
were captured.
In the expectation of finding the men
concerned in the murder of Police Officer
Robinson, a squad of police, acting under
instructions from Chief of Police Witt
man and Captain of Detectives Seymour,
raided the lodging-house kept by Â¦Â¦ Mrs.
Annie Dooley, at 630 Howard street, last
night and arrested eight men, whom the
police recognized as well-known crooks.

The police are now certain that they
will apprehend the murderers before many
hours have passed. Every Sheriff, con
stable and police officer from here to El
Paso has been notified to keep a sharp
lookout for Goucher and Brownie, and it
is their belief tnat now that their route is
known it will be almost impossible for
them to escape.
Captain Seymour yesterday ascertained
the name of the woman who lived in the
Turk-street house with Wade, "Brownie,**
"Kid" Goucher and the rest of the thugs.
He at onoe ' detailed two detectives to
search the tenderloin for her.' .Late last
night they succeeded in locating her lodg
ings, but up to an early hour this morn
ing she had not returned home. They will
probably take her into custody this morn
ing. The police expect the woman will
yield up the secrets of the desperate gang,
as she is known to have been implicated
in all their nefarious jobs.
POLICE GATHER IN THIEVES
Chief Wittman and Captain Seymour
held a lengthy consultation over the mat
ter at the latter's office last night. They
remained at the office until quite a late
hour waiting for some word from the
telegrams sent all along the line in their
endeavor to head the fugitives off. .
It was an easy matter for the crooks to
get aboard the train. They did not board
it from the side on which the passengers
got on, but sneaked around on the Berry
etreet side of the depot and clambered
aboard.
Upon arrivlne at San Jose, the . men
would have to leave the train, but from
that point they could easily catch a south
bound freight train and get further away
from the clutches of the local police.
Dinan and Wren interviewed the switch
man and yardmaster and as both railroad
men had the Incident fresh in their mem
ories the detectives were soon convinced
that the much sought for criminals were
the men who made their exit from the city
on Wednesday's train. The railroad men
were positive that the descriptions of
Goucher and "Brownie" given them by
the detectives tallied exactly with their
personal recollections of the appearance
of the two men who rode out of the city
under the steps of one of the Pullmans
attached to the south-bound filer.

Eseclal Dispatch to Tha Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.â In his ef
forts to obtain retirement and enter
Southern politics. Captain a Richmond
Pearson Hobson, the Merrimac hero, haif
encountered a serious obstable. The naval
retiring board which examined him yes
terday has reported to .Secretary Long
that he is fit for service and should be re
tained on active duty.
The report of the board is a sad blow
to Captain Hobson. While he had refused
to publicly discuss his political aspira
tions, his friends understood that he was
disposed to enter politics the moment he
was relieved from active duty in the navy.
He had even gone so far, it is stated, as
to consider the idea of resigning. It is
not believed, however, that he will take
action. The probability is that he will
indorse the movement begun among nls
friends to have Congress pass a bill per
mitting his retirement on full pay.
Captain Hobson's efforts to retire meet
with the unqualified approval of the Navy
Department. His position In the service
is rather anomalous and no one appre
ciates this fact more than Captain Hoh
son. He has the rank of captain when he
only has had the service of a young con
structor. He is now on duty with the
Charleston Exposition an4 when this
comes to a close it will be difficult to pro
vide him with an assignment suitable* to
his rank and experience. The department
is therefore disposed to facilitate Captain
Hobson's desire vo be placed on the retired
list.
â¢ A well knawn line officer .said to-day
that the navy should opposa tho bill for
Captain Hobson'e retirement on the
ground that the retired list iÂ« only tor
officers who are incapacitated from active
service by phyBlcal disability or age. Rep
resentative Bankhead of Alabama, whose
Beat in- Congress Captain Hobson is eaid
to want, has many f rienis iu the House
and they will probably prevent the pass
ape ox a bill contemplating the retirement
of the young constructor. .

.W., "WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.â James Al
man, who died in Washington yesterday,
according to his own \ story, refused a
bribe of $100,000 to put poison in j cream
which he served to President Lincoln. Al
man in 1865 kept a dairy on a farm, where
the Bureau of Printing, and Engraving
now stands, about a half-mile south of
the White House. He supplied cream and
milk to the White House and to Secretary
Stanton. In an interview some months
ago Alman said that early, in April, 1865,
as he was, driving his milk wagon toward
the White House; two men stopped him
and offered him $100,000 to putjpolson in
the cream he was taking to the President
In this interview Alman said: > Â¦ r
"One morning in the early part of April
â not two weeks before the President was
assassinatedâ I was driving along in my
wagon when two men stopped me, and one
of them asked if I did not want to make
$100,000 easy and quick. I scarcely knew
what to say, but I told them that I
guessed I did if it could be done on the
level. ; He . then asked me if 1 could keep
a secret and I told him I thought I could.
Then he got right close up to me, leaning
over the side of the : wagon and said:
â¢Well, my man, here's 1100,000 in good
money. Every cent of it is yours if you
will take this little box of powder and put
it in the cream you serve to President Lin
coln this morning. Pour, out the cream in
a measure and put this powder in it. No
body will ever suspect any thing . and ' the
$100,000 is yours.' r. . ' :: . ._ ; ,
"He showed me a tremendous big roll
of money, and it | looked mighty nice, but
I didn't want any of that kind. I told the
men * I wanted and ; needed Â¦ money, but I
could have nothing to do with such busi
ness if they really meant what they said."
They tried to argue the matter, with me,
but I wouldn't' listen to them Â¦. and . drove
awayowhile they cursed me. It is not true
that they assaulted me either then or aft
erward. At 'the- time I could not believe
the men were In earnest,. but thought they
were trying to play an early morning Joke
on me, I kept the transaction to Â¦ myself,

POISON IN CREAM
PEKING, Jan. 24.â This Dowager Em
press and her councilors are seriously
discussing the engagement of foreign ad
visers to reorganize the Government.
Yuan Shi Kai, Viceroy of Pechlll, Is
the inspiration of the movement. He will
return to Pao Ting Fu to-morrow, hav
ing devoted several days to impressing
upon the court the Importance of real re
forms and urging the adoption of foreign
methods as being the only practical meas
ures. He memorializes the throne, rec
ommending the employment of eight for
eigners of eminence in various branches
of governmental science, attaching them
to different boards.
The scheme in its present form, after
having been discussed by the members of
the council, is to engafee six foreigners as
authorities respectively on international
law and finance, and on military, naval,
parliamentary, domestic and - govern
mental affairs.
Yuan Shi Kal and his followers aVe
hopeful of practical 'results. They are
taking Japan as their model. An attempt
to institute a parliament of any sort
would, however, meet with tremendous
opposition from the Manchus.
While the employment of foreign ad
visers is no new idea with the Chinese
in only exceptional instances has it pro
duced lasting results, because -. inferior
men were often engaged to advise and
were usually only half-heartedly â¢ fol

men of unquestioned abilities and -clothe
them with some real authority.

"WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.â The House to-

LONDON. Jan. 25.â The Dally News at
taches importance to a dispatch from its
Hague correspondent stating that private
South African dispatches have reached
military circles at The Hague to *he ef
fect that important developments are ex
pected in Cape Colony. They add that
the power of the Boers in the Colony ia
daily increasing and the colonists are
Joining the Boer ranks in steadily increas
ing numbers. The rebellion is constantly
spreading. â¢ â¢
The executions of Commandants Lotter
and Scheepers have considerably excited
the loyalists and are causing even some
of the oldest of them to join the Boers,
whose position is more favorable than
at any time since the commencement of
hostilities.
The British forces suffered twelve de
feats from September to November, of
which no mention was made in Kitch
ener's dispatches.
Telegrams from impartial correspond
ents in South Africa have also been re
ceived at The Hague describing the pros
pects of Boer resistance as encouraging;
indeed, projects for the government of
independent South Africa are under con
sideration by the Boer leaders.
The Daily News, commenting' on the
foregoing, says its foreign correspondent
has hitherto furnished most accurate in
formation, but there is little doubt the
statements have been magnified by, his
Informants.
A. J. Balfour, the Government leader,
made a comprehensive denial In the
House of Commons yesterday of stories
of negotiations of peace with South
Africa. He declared that since the nego
tiations between Lord Kitchener and
General Botha no proposals having in
view the termination of the war had been
received from any one professing to have
the authority of the Boer leaders to make
proposals and that no discussions looking:
to peace were now proceeding.

pr questions thar the real reason for tak

sort of trust, whereby
rates would be absolutely in the hands

erated his previous statement concerning

J. J. Hill took the stand at 2 o'clock.
Much time was consumed with routine ex
aminations to show his official relations
with the Great Northern, Northern Pacific
and Burlington companies. â¢Â¦' â¢.
Hill was questioned in regard to the re r
latlon of the Northern Securities Com
pany, the Burlington, the Northern Pa
cific and the Great Northern to each
other. He said that the Northern Securi
ties Company owned no stock in the Chi
cago, Burlington and Quincy. Railway
Company (the new company), but owned
about half the stock of the Chicago, iBur
llngton and Quincy Railroad Company
(the old 'corporation). He explained that
the new â¢ company was really a union of
the three lines. which formed the old com
pany and operated the latter by virtue of
a. lease. The half of the stock of the old
company not owned by^the Northern Se
curities Company, the witness said, was
owned by the Northern Pacific Company.
In the new company, he said, the Great
Northern and Northern (Pacific were the
chief stockholders, having issued a joint
bond to cover the purchase, price of -the
C, B. and Q. Railroad Company. These
two companies, as stockholders, elect the
directors of the Burlington. 1
"There were approximately 19,000 stock
holders In the old Burlington, said Hill.
"It was impossible -"to- Â¦ buy" the stock,
amounting to about $100,000,000, in the. open
market, and another Plan -was adopted,
resulting in the sale of the property. like
a piece of reÂ»l estate; j The Northern
Pacific and Great. Northern issued $216,
000,000 joint boijds to pay for It." Â¦ . . ;
Hill's Views Are Heard.
The witness' averred that the Union Pa
clttc and the Southern Pacific were com
petitors, although he admitted that he be
lieved the Union ' Pacific controlled the
Southern Pacirtc. He declared that this
control could have no effect on rates, ow
ing to the existence of competition.
"A look at the map will show you what
this competition is," Stubbs observed par
enthetically.
Further . questioning by Commissioners
Prouty and Clements merely served to
strengthen Stubbs in his assertion that
the joint ownership of his roads had made
absolutely no difference in the mainten
ance or reduction of rates. â¢ . :
"None whatever," replied the witness.

Southern Pacific and the. Union Pacific,
followed Miller. Stubbs stated that E. H.
Harriman was chairman of the board of
directors of both, roads, but that he was
appealed to only in extraordinary cases
Stubbs said no such cases had arisen
since his. appointment and .that he had
proceeded under -his general- instructions
from Harriman.. He said that rates gen
erally had been fairly well maintained
but that there had been demoralization in
Utah and Colorado. He declared that the
Southern ' Pacific : and Atchlson, " Topeka
and Santa Fe were competitors.
Stubbs Tells of Traffic Methods.
Darius Miller, first vice president and
traffic manager of the Chicago, Burling
ton and Quincy, and former traffic man
ager of the Great Northern, was the first
witness. In answer to questions by Day,
attorney for the commission. Miller stated
that the Burlington was absolutely inde
pendent in "its operations \and in tho
making of rates." â¢
"Have" you received instructions ' from
either Mr. Hill or Mr. Harrlrnan in. re
gard to making rates?" Day. asked. .
"I have received none,"- the witness an
swered. ..â¢;Â¦â¢ .
Commissioner Prouty asked the witness
to What extent the Northern Pacific and
Great Northern were ; competitors,* and
Miller put the competitive traffic at about
25 per .cent. He declared that the Bur
lir.gton was not acompetitor of the Great
Northern and Northern Pacific. He said
the two northern Â¦ roads , had made fre
quent agreements to maintain rates, but
said he knew of no penalty having been
imposed for violation of agreements.

Hill .and: Harriman both reached Chi
cago during the morning and Hill, accom
panied by Grpver, his attorney, came at
once before the commission.- .
It is the expressed purpose of the com
mission to discover If . possible what
changes, if- any, 'have- been created be
tween the. general. public and railroads by
reason, of "associate management" of the
latter.- ThÂ« Commissioners desire to find
out if the community ot.interest idea has
affected the rate situation In a way con
trary 'to law 'or, as' claimed, if it is likely
to affect. the-.stability and. non-discrimina
tion of and -in rates 'for which the com
mission has long battled. 'Â¦â¢Â¦â¢
Hill and llarriman Arrive.
Hill talked vigorously and earnestly. At
the close of the session, when Chairman
Knapp offered to allow Hill to leave for
New York if the latter felt that staying
in Chicago would inconvenience him seri
ously* Hill declared that his time be
longed to the commission and that ho Â»le-
Fircd in every way to aid ihern to the
extent of h?s ability. Chatvrnan^Knapp
theieupon paid that Hill would be again
called to the stand. to-morrow morning.
"There are some old mep-some very
old men â interest<ed-.in the management- of
the Great Northern," said he. "Two of
them are over EO and several over 70
years. They wanted to form a close cor
poration into which they could confide
their interests with the assurance that
the road would be managed along the
lines Â¦which have made it a.- success. It
was to have taken over one-third of the
stock of the road. The plan seemed to
be a good one, and then it was proposed
to let ail the stockholders in â not alone
the few owners of the one-third, but all
of them. The plan met with approval,
and then it broadened Into the idea of
taking in the Northern Pacific also. The
reads have worked In harmony for twen
ty years and the change in the holder of
the securities would make no difference.
It can make no difference and will make
no difference."
Aged Men Form the Plan.
for three and a half hours before
the Interstate Commerce Commission
here to-day. In answer to questions tend
ing to sh'ow the effect of the community of
interests plan on rates, the veteran rail
roader declared that competition does not
lower rates, but on the contrary, he be
lieved that it advanced them. He de
clared that in the Northwest, where for
twenty years the Northern Pacific and
the Great Northern had been at peace,
where one road has agreed with the
other on rates and maintained the agree
ments, rates were lower than in any
other part of the country.
In regard. to the. purchase of the Bur
lington by the Northern Pacific and the
Great Northern, Hill said that the pur
chase was a matter of necessity and was
not due to a "movement in line with the
trust idea." . Â¦
He testified to the formation of the
Northern Securities Company, and in do
ing so gave a reason far more simple than
has generally been conjectured. :

Wallace told of the telephonic communi
cation with Rice's house and of the
covcry that Rice had died tne orevioua
day. Counsel for Patrick objected to
every question asked on this line on tne
ground that the witness could not testify
to hearsay evidence, but the â¢ Recorder
overruled the objections until Assistant
District Attorney Garviff asked who an
swered the telephone. He sustained the
objection that Wallace could not tell who
it waÂ«. Wallace testified that he. had
never seen Patrick until the day the check
was presented. So far as he knew. Rice s
business was attended to by Jones, the

written by Mr. Rice." ...
NEW YORK, Jan. 24.â The taking of
evidence was begun to-day In. the trial of
Albert T. Patrick, a lawyer, on an indict
ment charging him with the murder of
William Marsh Rice in this city in Sep
tember, 1900.
Under cross-examination "Weatherbe?
was not admitted as an expert In hand
writing, as he could not analyze the sig
nature on the C5.00O check. The doubt in
his mind was more reneral than specific.
Weatherbee was still on the stand at ra
cess. -. .,.!"Â¦â¢ â¢ . Â¦-..-Â¦
"The prosecution should not be allowed
to say that a murder was committed te
cause they think a check was forged."
said Moore, for Patrick. The Recorder
admitted the check.
Counsel -for the defense objected to the
admission of the $25,000 check as evidence
on the ground that tho defendant was un
der Indictment for forging that checJc and
that it would not be fair to biaÂ» the mindj
of the jury by admitting it.
, "Thl3 check la one of the steps by which
I intend to prove the conspiracy between
this defendant and Jones," replied Os
borne.
W. C. Weatherbee. a clerk in the bank
of S. M. Swenson & Son. said he knew
Rice for twelve years. He waa asked to
tell of a visit alleged to have been made
by Jones, the valet-secretary, to tha wit
ness' home In Brooklyn, but this was
ruled out. Weatherbee said he had never
seen Patrick until the day the check was
handed In at the bank. He hao not known
Patrick to be connected in any way with
Rice's business. When Patrick called at
the bank he .saw Swenson. In the conver
sation that day Patrick said Rice's body
was to be cremated, as "the old gentleman
was a crank on cremation." Patrick al3o
said there had been, an understanding be
tween him and Rice as to what was to be
done -with the. proceeds of., the ctxeeka.
Weatherbee gave It as his opinion that
the fJ3.000 check was not signed by Wil
liam II. Rice. .

,. "Out in: Iowa." he; said, "it was com
plained that the grain rate waa too high
Â¦We -went out there s and Investigated, and
discovered- that the complaint was- Just
aod ordered a reduction, a reduction to a
'reasonable rate.'i as you say. What hap
pened? The road3 paid ho attention to it;
v At this- point .Commissioner Prouty In
terrupted with a little story of the woes
of the commission.
Woes of. tho Commission:
The entire afternoon was devoted to ex
amining -witnesses for the defense from
Round and Big valleys as to tho general
reputation of. Robert Courtwright, one
of the witnesses for the prosecution, for
truth/honesty and Integrity. Many.wit
nesses were examined and without ex
ceptionthey testified as to â¢ his. unrelia
bility. ; Some declared they would not be-
Uove him under oath. The witnesses were
questioned as to the reputations of many
of the men now imprisoned here, charged
with complicity" In^the" lynching, and. the
general opinion was that the men were
good- citizens. I The court would not per
mit testimony as to the likelihood of the
prisoners taking ' part in the . lynching.
Some of the witnesses admitted being op
posed to the prosecution, but they in
variably snid that this opposition would
not affect their testimony.
The usual small rows between counsel
and spicy remarks from the bench helped
to enliven the afternoon sessfon. The
form of Raker's questions .was sometimes
cbjectlonable and the oourt . accused him
of Injecting words into his interrogations
for the benefit of, tho jury. - ' < .
We have just granted a reduction In the
Northwest, a considerable reduction, yet
there was no competition to force it. -why
did we do It? Because it Is for the good
of. the people in our territory, and there
fore beneficial to us also. The public Is en
titled to a ( reasonable . rate. That Is the
law. and, the common law,' although I am
no lawyer, and the railroad's self-inter
est must grant it.'.' . - .â¢ - - i
â¢ .'.'But suppose the rate is not reasonable
from tho shipper's point of view?" asked
Commissioner Clements. ' .
; "Then he can go into court and secure
a reasonable rate." .
Trying to Impeach Courtwright.
Raker' attempted" to show that Couri
wright's reputation had been, bad and
said he was entitled to show it .was such
at the time of his testimony in January.
Post objected, saying he could show the
character of a witness only up to the
time of the .commencement of the alleged
crtme. . ' - > .â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
Raker â Once bad. always bad.
ThÂ» Judg* â Your remark, Mr. Baker, almost
strikes jrie dumb and. blind. .. , ... -
A long argument followed and was still
on when reces3 wa3 declared.
Joseph Wilton, a caloon-keepcr of Adln,
was called to the stand and asked as to
the reputation of Courtwright for peaca
and quietness. He said -it was bad. He
admitted not having seen Courtwright for
fifteen years. ,
. Raker attempted i to offer exhibits of
certain pages of tho testimony of Myers.
An objection was sustained.
Judge Harrington sustained the objec
tion and a long argument foliowed. Har
rington ruled that it was a waste of time
for the defense to introduce the Grand
Jury testimony, as it was absolutely cum
ulative; that no d!screpahc!es could b>
shown in the statements, and it did not
tend to establish the fact not In evidence.
The court asked that no time be lost use
lessly in introducing testimony and said
that the Jury waa continually complaining
to' him of the slo-wness of the proceedings.
On re-dlrect examination. Raker at
tempted to read a portion of Myers* tes
timony before the Grand Jury and PoÂ«t
objected, as- It was not admissible for
impeachment! that it was not proper re
direct examination. " â¢.
questioned as to the pistols which he
went into the. room back of the barroom
to secure on the night -of the lynching,
Myers . said there ..should have been two
there, but they. .were .missing. He sa^d
they were usually unloaded, anyhow. He
could not explain why he went after un
loaded pistols, except that he wanted to
frighten the masked men m the barroom.
Myers, said that after he went out on
the porch he saw Sidney Goyette. Erving
Carpenter and James W. Brown. The
men came up from behind him. -Myers
had previously testified before the uiand
Jury that they came up from the bridge.
He explained the- discrepancy by saying
he had had-time to think over his testi
mony and had come to the cone. usion that
ihey.cafme 'up from behind' him. â¢" Ihey
fired -some!- shots' and 'some shots' were
fired in the direction of the bridge. The
party adjourned to the barroom and tne
witness told Carpenter and Brown that
he- would not allow these men (the men
lynched, presumably) to be brought" back
to" the hotel. Samuel Parks and â¢ Frank
Teterau came into the barroom about that
time. â¢ . â¢ ; â¢ 'â¢ - 'Â¦' Â¦
Wagon-Spokes in Evidence. * .
Myers said that he saw wagon spoke3
lying on the porch and one in the bar
rpcrn.
Post Introduced the spokes, in the face
of objection hy the defense, and 31yer3
said they werd similar. Post then read
certain portions of Myers' testimony be
fore the Grand Jury and asked if the
witness had so testified; He replied:
"Yes; I presume I. did.'.' â¢
Cross-Examination of Myers.
Thes defense announced that it had fin
ished with Witness Myers, and General
tost, tor the prosecution, tooK up tne
cross-examination, fost succeeded in get
ting, an admission from the witness that
his eyesight was extremely bad and that
he might have been mistaken as to the
identintation of Trow bridge and Richard
Nichols on the night of the lynching,
though he felt reasonably certain In h.s
own mind that his identlncation of Trow
briage 8r., was perfect. AsKed if any
one had been' reading, the testimony of
the witness in tne jail or within h:s hear
ing,. Myers replied in the negative, though
he hag^ heard "his daughter's testimony
talked of by her husband and his wife.
The statement had been made that Mrs.
Richard Nichols, who was expelled from
the courtroom yestercay, had oeen taking
notes of the proceedings for the Â¦ benefit
of the prisoners and witnesses in tne
case. . -; ' '. ' "

January 2.
The disappearance of the Count and
the young girl created a sensation In
Southern California. It was not known
that thev had eloped together, but sus

girl's brother offered a reward for the
arrest of the Count, but all efforts to lo

Henry also proposed, that the caucus ac

wherLthe same accorded with the declara
tions of the last national platform. - The
vote was taken first on Henry's minority,
propositions and they â¢ were .defeated by
a 'vote of 17 to 92. The majority declara
tion 'â¢ was then , adopted : without â¢ dissent.'
The Fitzgerald.. McCIellan and other, reso
lutions were laid on- the table, thus leaV
ing the majority declaration as the unani
mous sense ,of 'the Democratic: members
of the House. The caucus also * adopted
the following:- . " â¢ â¢'
. "Resolved, That the territories "of Ari
zona: Oklahoma and New Mexico are en
titled to statehood and should be admitted
to i the ' Union - on ' equal- footing , with- the
balance of the States and we pledge the
support of the Democrats in the House to
such." " . '. â¢ *-Â¦' Â¦'Â¦'' Â«'-' Â¦ Â¦ 'Â¦'- ' '.,''!-
It is not within Â¦ the ' province of a ; Demo

cratic platform, but.lt is the duty j of every
Democratic Representative to adhere to the na
tional Democratic platform, until the succeeding
convention adopt3 another, platform. â¢â¢Â¦,:.Â¦
i The minority report of Henry of Texas
proposed the following in place of the
McCIellan Â« and â¢ Fitzgerald resolutions
heretofore referred to: . ' ( , :>"
We are of opinion that, as the representatives
of our various constituencies and members of
the, caucus made up of Buch representatives,
we have no power or authority to construct or
promulgate a platform- of . principles- for our
party; that we cannot increase or minimize
the binding effect of the platforms of the party
heretofore regularly made and adopted by the
people In convention assembled - for that, pur
pose; that in the House of which we are mem
bers we â¢ should vigorously and aggressively
battle for Democratic principles, and with equal
vigor and aggressiveness we should oppose
everything contrary, in substance or method,
t6 those principles and should meet every ques
tion as it arisen with. a full conference and a
solid and undivided front. .'
The caucus was an outgrowth of : ani
mated discussion nmong Democratic mem
bers ever-.slnce the present session of
Congress began, the chief issue being as
to the extent to which tho, Kansas City
platform should be reaffirmed or should
be superseded by a new declaration of
policy. It was to .receive the special re
port of a committee of twelve members,
appointed early in the session, that the
caucus of to-night was held..
The Interest taken -was shown in the
large attendance, 139 Democrats out of a
total of 153 being : present. Richardson
presented the majority . report, concurred
in by all of the.members of the special
committee except Henry. It recited the
work of the committee,, and closed ,wltn
the following recommendation:

In I honor of Robert Burns, Scotland's
beloved poet, St. Andrew's Society gave
a delightful 'entertainment 1 last night in
Scottish. Hall, on Larkin street. The hall
was thronged with Scotia's lads and las
sies, and â¢ the whole celebration was so
successful..that it will- long ; be remem
bered as a- memorable event in the annals
'of Â¦ Stl 'Andrew's Society. -The .programme,
which" had Â¦ been carefully arranged, was
particularly .worthy of the occasion, as it
consisted entirely of c selections â¢ from,

carry, the minds of. those present back to
old familiar scenes in bonnle Scotland.
Â¦ â¢Â¦-Professor Andrew C Lawson'of the
University of California delivered an elo
quent, address on "Robert Burns." :He
spoke of the poet's lovable and happy
disposition; of his affection for children
and their innocent glee, and his insatiable
love for. nature. He quoted ' from Burns'
poems to show the sweetness of the songs
and the truoness of the poet's interpreta
tion of nature. ". Professor Lawson's ad
dress was greatly enjoyed and it was fre

Those whose names were on the peti
tion were not those who withdrew from
La -Vespero. â¢ The opposition to the in
stitution of a new parlor in South San
Francisco ' was on the ground that while
one could live in that section of the city
there is â¢ not Â¦ room there for two. '
"Now that thj new parlor has been in
stituted, it is probable that the action of
the grand president will stand until the
meeting of the next grand parlor, when
the whole matter will be brought up for
discussion. There are some â¢ who. think
they can find a way to bring the /matter
into; court and have the institution de
clared Illegal, y; '-Â¦Â¦-.
In accordance with a provision of the
constitution, the petition was presented
to each parlor in this city for consent.
In cities where more than live parlors are
located, if twenty or more black balls are
cast against the candidates for admis
sion into. the proposed parlor, the charter
must be referred. The result of the . ac
tion taken must then be transmitted in
detail to the office of the grand secretary
and no parlor can be instituted without
three-fourths of the parlors have glv^n
consent. All the parlors except La Ves
pero and Minerva gave consent to the
institution. The grand president laid the
petition before La Vespero Parlor, but
that body adjourned before a motion was
made to act on the proposition. The
grand president declined to resubmlt it,
holding that the parlor had had an op
portunity to vote upon it, but forfeited
its right. Then it went before Minerva
Parlor, last Monday, but that body de
ferred action until Wednesday. The pro
ceedings in the parlor were of , such . a
character that the petition \ was .with
drawn and the grand president, knowing
that more than three-fourths of the par
lors had voted in favor, decided to insti
tute the parlor, and she did.
Some years ago La Vespero Parlor was
instituted in Sou*th San Francisco ' with a
large membership, and all went along
well until about a year and a half ago.
when something occurred which caused
one of the . members to Â¦ withdraw. She
was followed by twenty or more, an'i
these desired to form a new parlor. ' They
learned, however, that La 'Vespero Par
lor would oppose the granting of a char
ter, so. they organized a social club, hop
ing that. in time the feeling would soften
and consent would be gained. Permission
to. organize could not -be gained during
the. term of Mrs. Ema Gett as grand
president, and. when Mrs. Baker. became
grand president an application was made
for a charter.

Rabbi Voorsanger delivered his contin
uation lecture on the relation of religion
to - civilization at the Congregation
Emanu-EI last evening. He said that ha
would answer the two interrogations
which he submitted last weekâ first. What
had religion done for civilization? and
second. What had civilization done for
religion? The lecturer likened the church
of thousands of years ago to the mother,
and the disciples as the children who had
gone forth into the world ' and gleaned
fresh knowledge and learning. Still,- with
all the learning and new experience, the
children as years went on clung to the
mother, but brought home new ideas ac
cording to the worldly experiences that
had come to them. That civilization had
done anything for religion is a matter
that is sometimes denied since, by some,
religion was regarded as Immutable as it
possesses the attributes of God himself.
It is, he said, the aspect and not the prin
ciple that changes, for religion remains
the inspiration and the teacher. Speaking
of the evolution of science and art, he
demonstrated their gradual severance
from the church. They went their way
by a natural progress against which big
otry only will rebel. With -the going out
Into the world the mind of man became
wide awake to the avenues of the uni
verse. Curtain after curtain rolled Â«p on
activity, which was viewed with aston
ishment and created an appetite for men
tal progression. Man grew to have an in
exhaustible desire to penetrate the fast
nesses of wisdom.' Religion, he said, in
spite of herself has been carried along
by thje processes of her own children.
They had given her 4 new .inspiration.
Judaism, he declared, is an evolved re
ligion. There has been no religion grow
more than that of Judaism.

The Rev. Dr. Nieto delivered a lecture
last evening at the Congregation Sherith
Israel, choosing as his subject "Wisdom."
By careful and profound analysis he pro
ceeded to show that wisdom is a condi
tion that can only be attained through
practical application of knowledge which
had been -acquired, also through compari
son of that knowledge with the expe
riences of life as it is. While knowledge,
he said, only suggests knowing the
thoughts of others, wisdom is the experi
menting- which verifies the theories that
others frame. The lecturer then went on
to show that a man who attains wisdom
is unmoved by prejudices and is cool un
der the excitement which stirs others.
He is calm when attacked and faces all
conditions that meet him during life. with
fortitude and equanimity. "Wisdom ls a
precious blessing," said he in conclusion;
â¢it guides man in his daily business, ca
reer as it guides him in the duties he
owes to his fellows in his private life.
Wisdom prompts and upholds civilization
and is the foundation of nations."

The board had citedra number of con
tractors to appear who had I asked~ for ex
tensions of time, believing that Mayor
Schmitz would be present at the meeting.
The Mayor was unable to attend, how
ever, so the contractors received a "mild
lecture and were .cautioned to be mor?
particular about completing their con
tracts within the time first agreed upon,
as no further extensions will be granted.

[ George McGinn stated that he had se
cured the signatures, of one-half of the
property~owners of frontage on the. block
and as Â¦ the improvement company had
tho ether half tne application was denied,
as it requires a majority of the property
owners '.o agree to the work. Some of the
names figured on both applications. : -
. McDonald then charged that fraud ls
being committed in securing signatures'
forÂ» private contracts. He said that the
system was. unfair to the property owner,
the contractor and the city. In . many
cases solicitors bringing in private con
tracts make special arrangements where
by rebates are agreed upon. When the
contractors attempt to collect the full
amount of their bills the agreements for
rebates are produced by the property own
ers. " Â¦ â¢
McGinn replied by charging that Mc-
Donald's solicitors indulged In the rebate
practice. McDonald did not Â¦' deny . this,
but reitefated that private contracts
should be done away with. Â¦ He . said Â¦ the
Board of Public Works ; should Â¦ have all
street work done by public contract.- As
there is an ordinance on the subject no
such action could be taken, but hereafter
signatures to applications for private con
tracts will be closely examined. Â¦ ' c
J. W. McDonald addressed the Board of
Public- Works yesterday inoppositlon~to
the manner in which private contracts arc
entered into for the repairing of streets.
The matter came up on the application of
the City Street Improvement Company,
of wlilcn McDonald, is president, to repave
the roadway of Green street, between

There is some foundation for .the gossip
that John C. -Wray of Los Angeles had

sert that- the inquiry ; recently made : by
Special Agent Thomas had no bearing on
Wray's offer to resign. The true ,story
is said to be -that â¢.Wray,- ,Â¦ feeling, that his
own departure from: the office-holding fold
might prolong the- term' of his chief, John
C. Lynch, readily offered to sacrifice him

Word comes from San Bernardino Coun

another term is somewhat complicated by
the efforts of A. C. Kendall to get on: the
ticket as candidate for. the State Board

reasonably expect to get' two such im

for clerk of the Supreme Court. .The cler-'

will hardly have the temerity to ask the

Some Sensible Advice to Women by
Mrs. E, Sailer, .
President iGerman Belief Association, Los Angeles, OaL
Â¦ â¢ .. Â¦ -* . â¢ Â¦ - /
;;.;",' Owing to modern methods of living, not one woman in a thousand ap-
proaches this perfectly natural change without experiencing a train of very-
annoying and sometimes painful symptoms. - Â¦
Those dreadful hot flashes, sending 1 the blood surging 1 to the heart until it
seems ready to burst, and the faint feeling that follows, sometimes with chills,
as if the heart were going to stop for good, are only a few of the symptoms of
a dangerous nervous trouble. The nerves are crying out for assistance. The
cry should; be heeded in time. Xydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, was prepared to meet the needs of woman's system at this tryinjr
period of her life, and all women who use it pass through thiB trying period
with comfort and safety.
- - - Â¦Â¦ Â¦;-Â¦/Â¦. â¢ ' Â¦ . .
"Deab 'Mrs. Pinkham:â When I passed through what is known
as 'change of life,' I had. two years' sufferings â sudden heat, and as
quick chills* -would pass over me ; my appetite wa3 variable and I never
could tell tor a day at a time j how I â¢Â¦.Â¦would feel the next day.- Five
bottles of L<ydia E. Pinkham's "Vegetable Compound changed all
that, my days became 'days of health, and I have enjoyed every day
since,â now six years. ">lo! -
""We have used considerable of your Vegetable Compound in our
charitable work, as "we find that to "restore a .poor mother to health so
she can support herself and those dependent upon her, if such there be,
is truer charity than to give other aid. You have ray hearty endorse-
ment, for you have proven yourself a true friend to suffering women."
â Mrs.. E. Sailer, 736i Hill St, Los Angeles, Cal.
When one stops to think about the good Mrs n Sailer, derived from Mrs.
Pinkham's. advice end medicine, it seems almost beyond belief yet it is all
true as stated in her letter published above at her own request.
Ko other medicine in the world has received such widespread
and unqualified endorsement. Refuse all substitutes. ;
As a matter of positive fact Mrs. Pinkham has on file thousands of letters
from women who have been safely carried' through that danger period
" Change of Life." Mrs. Sailer's cure is not an unusual one for Mrs. Pink-
ham's medicine to # accomplish.
, No other person can give such advice to women Â¦who
are sick as can Mrs; Pinkham, for none have had such a great
experience â her address is Lynn, Mass., apd her advice freeâ if
you are sick write herâ you are foolish if you don't.

The industry itself is amply large enough to jus-,
tify its representation in the Cabinet. : There is
scarcely a State or Territory in the.. Union that has
not more or. less interest in mines, and fn many of
the States these interests 1 are of immense propor
tions! The mineral output of the_ United States in
1900 approximated the [rvalue of $1,700,000,000, and it
is certain to increase with the years.. In: California
the industry in its present magnitude and in its pos
sibilities is second to Â¦ rio other., Our delegation,
therefore, ought to be earnest and.insistent;in'urg
ing the creation of the;, desired department. It is an
issue upon .which any lagging or -lukewarmness im
plies an indifference to.'the general welfare. " : ' :
Of the importance of the issue â not to the mining,
interest only, but to the whole countryâ there- can be
no question.' The United States is the greatest
mining country in the world, and yet we are the only'
great - -nation that- does- hot provide for "ah adequate
supervision of the industry. At the present time^the;
direction of mining interests on the part of the Gov
ernment is divided among Triariy bureaus' Â¦ scattered
through different departments. The . result of this
division of authority has been a confusion.which ma
terially interferes ; with the development of our . min
eral lands and the operation of our mines. It is be
cause of that confusion the mining men have! asked
for the establishment of *a Department of Mines and.
Mining. Jt is believed by those most familiar with
the industry that we can never have a proper gbvr
ernmental supervision^ the industry uflitil the.de-
partment has been created.; . -^ ..- *Â¦/'. Â¦.'/_
The reports of lukewarmness on the part of any of
the California delegation are the more surprising be-,
cause the subject has been long under . discussion
throughout the entire West and hardly a single ar
gument! has been 'brought against it by any repre
sentative man in this section of the Union! The great
mining States. naturally look to California for lead
ership in this movement, which is for the welfare of
all, and it would be a' serious' loss of prestige to us
should our delegation -at the nationaUcapital break
down or disclose the existence of any inharmony on
the subject when it comes up for. action! .
Even were it conceded that the chances of ob
taining the creation of the department , at' this ses
sion of Congress are slight, that would afford no rea
son for lagging in the work for it. The more we ac
complish at this ! session the better will be our'posi-;
tion hereafter. . We. have everything to gain by an
fight and nothing to lose. -On the other
hand, should our representatives , display no interest
in the matter they will give the opponerits of
the movement a rdltson for asserting that the people
of California as a whole are not interested 'in the
movement and that it is being worked up by a few
mining men for their own interests.
j-< EPORTS from Washington to the effect that
r\ some of the representatives in Congress from
A \ this State are "lukewarm" in their support
of the bill to establish a Department of Mines and
Mining under the supervision of a' Cabinet officer
should set ; in motion a sufficient amount of activity
here to. warm the gentlemen". to ! a greater jeal. . .The.
effort to obtain the desired department. might as. well
be abandoned if our "representatives do. not stand
for it firmly and persistently. from first to last.

FOREST PRESERVATION.
tUDGE HEBBARD'S decision in the Mahony
Jcase is to the effect that the Clerk, being
a county officer, is not'subject to removal or to
investigation by the Mayor, 'who is a municipal of
ficer. To that extent the decision is favorable to
Mahony, but no further. Irwfact, the Judge plainly
declared from the bench that;' "for malfeasance, mis
feasance or nonfeasance in office an officer ought to
be removed. I believe that every officer ought to do
his duty and should not enter into such contracts as
are alleged here; but the only question is, Has the
Mayor the power to suspend the County Clerk, a
county officer?" k
The statement from the bench concerning the con
tract is as important as the decision concerning the
exemption of county officers from the operation of
the provisions of the charter. It has been somewhat
a matter of dispute whether the contract the County
Clerk is alleged to have made is in its nature suffi
cient to work a forfeiture of office. The statement
of Judge Hebbard appears conclusive on that point
It can hardly be doubted that in saying "I believe
every officer ought to do his duty and should not
enter into such contracts as are alleged here" the
Judge meant to intimate that if Mahony's participa
tion in such a contract can be proven in the proper
way in the proper tribunal his dismissal from office
should promptly follow.
The declaration clears away some" of the complexi
ties of the case. It may be accepted now that the
contract alleged to have been made is in its nature
a violation of law. The Mayor cannot remove the of
fender nor suspend, him, but there is a way to reach
him if the fact of the contract can be proven. That
proof of course can be readily furnished. In fact, it
was furnished during the investigation before the
Mayor, and-will be forthcoming again as soon as the
proper authorities desire it. Such being the case,
those upon whom the duty rests should enter at once
upon the task of bringing Mahony to trial.
It is to be borne in mind that '; the personality., of â
the accused is but a minor matter in the problem. '
The important issue is that of upholding the law and
maintaining it in its full integrity. The office of
County Clerk is one whose fair â¢ and. impartial ad
ministration concerns every citizen. No man should
be permitted to hold it who is not characterized by a
strict fidelity to duty and a scrupulous observance
cf all the requirements of law. In the hands of a man
who is willing and ready to violate the law the office
becomes a source of possible danger to every liti
gant in the courts. It is for that reason the public
takes so keen an interest in the case and is so eager
to see the law vindicated, justice done and the office
purged of the control of a violator of law.
The assertion of Mahony's friends that even if the
contract alleged against him were - established in
court it would not constitute an offense sufficient to
cause his removal vanishes before the plain statement
of Judge Hebbard that no officer should enter into
such a contract. The way, then, seems to be clear for
a final victory' for the Jaw. It is now the duty of the
proper authorities to act promptly.

'Â¦PERSONAL MENTION.;
fETANUS, or lockjaw; can be cured, and'the epidemic of the disease now
raging in: Camden, N. J., and other" places in the East can be checked,"
said Dr. A. teteve of Pittsburg the other day, where he has charge of the
C. L. Magee pathological department of Mercy Hospital.
"For the last six years I have been working on a formula," said Dr.
' Leteve. "The method of treatment is^radically different from the present one
and the recovery is much more rapid. According to the' old method of treatment,
the skull is trephined and about a quart of serum injected into the brain. Every
body knows recoveries are not frequent. ( By the new treatment serum, which I
obtain from sheep, is injected, not by the quart, but in very small quantities.
The point. of. Injection is jiot the' brain, but in the left side, near the liver. -.'In the
four cases I have cured there is now not a sign of the disease. .
"My first case was that of a 10-year-old boy, who cut his finger with a piece
of glass and tetanus set in. He had spasms, and was not expected to live much
longer, .when I gave him a hypodermic injection. In four days I gave him four
teen injections, and the boy fully recovered. ' . â¢ Â¦ ' ..
"The second case was that of "a .woman 40 years old, who contracted lockjaw
by stepping on a rusty nail. She was given thirteen injections and was cured In
days. ..-Â¦Â¦- _ V . ) ' ' : 
"My third case was that of a man 45 years old, who cut his foot while work-'
ing in a stable, and tetanus set In.' I gave him twelve injections, curing him in.
four days." , â¢ , .
"Then I decided. to try it on a horse which was suffering from tetanus. The in
jections of- serum were larger than those I had administered to human beings.
Â¦ In a few days- the horse had entirely recovered. â¢ Â¦ Â¦ '< : - '.". ->'
"I'd- be egotistical to say my method will cure every case. In the' fouy cases.
I, speak, of .It. was an unqualified successl It may be .tried _ on jsome others whom
it might not'eure. My professional brethren think- well of the' new .-itreatmeojL.?
When I had the matter all studied out -about.- a* .year; ago-* I told : * some -of-' -the-r
most prominent "physlcianÂ¥ in the city. Nearly all said it was all right in the
ory, 'butâ â .'.'. Since then I have demonstrated to them that it is allright in
practice so far as I have gone." 0 ' â¢*â¢ ,~ . â¢ '
1 Dr. Leteve is recognized as a specialist on histology and bacteriology. He
- was born in Paris and studied medicine first with Professor Rour Dolrrel of the
Pasteur i Institute. He: came, to America in 1889, and for several years was con
nected with the Pasteur Institute In New York. He went to Pittsburg in 1890 and
was put in charge of the laboratory at Mercy Hospital. Â¦

An amusing incident occurred the other
day at Charing Cross road, where the
bookstall keepers are dreading their ban
ishment by the County Council on- ac
count of tttelr being supposed to inter
fere with.th'e foot passenger traffic. There
was." great excitement' 1 when the
was circulated? among, the*, ',bbplÂ£sellfeTsÂ»
that the King ! had". sent ;'bJbv portrait?, \to
one of the leading men of the trade, Ber
tram Dobell. Now, nearly every class of
people other than royalty has been rep
resented in the expressions of sympathy
which h^ye reached these . booksellers
since .the Westminster edict against them
was first made. The knowledge of . this
fact has perhaps led the fraternity to lend
too ready an ear to the fluttering, tale of
the royal demonstration in their favor.
The report, however, was very precise,
and the authority of Dobell was freely
quoted for it. When Dobell waa visited
by a deputation of his brother sellers of
secend-hand books, it was found the news
was quite true. The King had really sent
a portrait, but it was "The (King," a
weekly illustrated paper.
Lord Acton's reputation as a historian
has attracted general interest to . the
"History of Modern Times,'/ which he un
dertook to edit for the Cambridge Uni
versity Press. t
There is corresponding regret, that ."the
state of his. health, doea not allow him to
continue the task. He will seek compara
tive rest for a time, but no doubt his
counsel will be at the disposal of the new
editors. They are Dr. Ward, Master of
Peterhouse. Cambridge, who is a great
authority on the history of literature; Dr.
Prathero, the learned editor of the Quar
terly Review, and Stanley Leathes, an
other distinguished Cambridge scholar.
Lord Acton has been able to edit the first
volume of the history, which deals with
the Renaissance period. It will appear
during the course of this year.
Sir Wyke Bayllss has recently been en
gaged upon an"art book - dealing with
Leighton, Millais, Burne-Jones, Watts and
Holman Hunt. ",
It is now almost finished. M>S3W.
Sampson Low will publish it during the
spring. Sir Wyke gives many personal
reminiscences of the great artist3 of
m horn be writes, for he was known to
them all. The specialty of the book la
that It reveals to, the reader the differ
ence of vision that underlies their tech
niaue. All of them were figure painters,
all of them of the Victorian era, yet each
was essentially alone in his art.
The fact seems to be that English poets,
novelists and dramatists either agree with
Hall Calne or with George Meredith, who
laconically replied that he had no opin
ions on the subject. '.
A book which the Messrs. Longman an
nounce, namely, "The Correspondence of
the Princess lieven," should be interest
ing. Â¦ v
She was a great figure in London so
ciety during the early part of the last
century. These letters were written dur
ing a residence in London which extend
ed from 1812 to 1834, a period of no small
stir and Interest in various ways. As the
wife of. the; Russian Embassador Prin
cess* Lieven was naturallyMn a good posi
tion ' to ' learn what .was going on. * H4r
letters will,- therefore, be another contri
bution to that delightful kind of history
which is to be found in the "Greville Ma
moirs." ..-_,!.,
A great deal of discussion has been cre
ated in literary 'circles by the proposal
for the incorporation of a British acad
emy for the promotion of historical, phil
osophical 'and philological studies. Its
first fellows are to include professors of
Greek, Sanscrit. Latin. Hebrew. Anglo-
Saxon and Celtic.
Hall Caine, oa being asked his opinion
on the subject,- said he would regret the
addition of dramatists and novelists ' to
the. list of . fellows. Â¦ because no academic
study of a thing so variable," so emo
tional, so Individual,' so Independent of
principles as ; the ' work of imaginative
writers or their art could be anything but
misleading and mischievous. Further,
Mr. Caine' did not consider -the/ experi
ments 'of the French Academy at all en
couraging. . ' Â«. .. ...
Mrs. Cralgie points out that if Imagi
native writers believed that such an in
stitution on French principles could be
maintained in England they should" have
the courage of the distinguished schol
ars .whose names are 'printed- in the Ga
zette-and prepare a petition '..in similar
lines.
The Kentucky law, which is wholly upheld by the Supreme. Court/ covers, fully
every question of extortion and discrimination, of which â¢ communities and individuals
may be the victims, j The local court, in the county where the complainant; is'domiciled,
has primary jurisdiction of the offender,' and the Railroad Commission must initiate the
prosecution and see that an Indictment is found and the offender tried and punished, i
N In order to take advantage of . this "decision the : law of this State must, give this
power to the commission, and then the people will have this short cut to redress of any
grievance against a transportation corporation. " '.^^'^/'i-''" Â¦ -Â¦
Our readers will see that this is one way of reaching the prompt action. which The
Call has advocated. The decision.of- the United States Supreme Court giving, tfiis impor
tant function to railroad commissions when conferred^ by State law was written by Chief
Justice Fuller and was concurred in by the full bench. ,'
The next Legislature of this State will be called upon to adopt the Kentucky
statute and bring Cajifornia under the wing of this Federal decision. .Such a law will
give a new lease of life to the . Railroad Commission by giving it a function it can
discharge. - '. "" . 'v
The.,railroad^law of Kentucky contains the same long arid^short haul clause as the
interstate commerce act, and the same provision for exoneration .-as that act. The recent
law jiist passed upon by the United, States Supreme Court and affirrhed-as constitutional
and valid, in addition t to giving the local- courts civil and criminal ' -jurisdiction, of .the
railroads, provides that if a rba*d violate the. long and short haul-clause, without exonera
tion by the State Commissioiij an order ? in writing to that .'. effect I'sHali-" be entered and de
livered to the complainant and to the offending company, arid.tb the^Grand Juryof any
county the -Circuit Court of which has jurisdiction, "in order that the railroad company
or carrier may be indicted- for the offense, ; and the Railroad Commission shall use'^all
proper efforts to see that such 1 company or carrier is .indicted ;and prosecuted." ;. .;
This law is directly upheld by the Ifederal Supreme C^urt. In former decisions
that court left State commissions powerless to enforce the simplest decree. Now it picks
them out of the gutter and puts the whole/ judiciary machinery attheir "'service'.; -It will be
observed that by this last decision proceedings adverse Â¦ to a railroad company, do not
originate in the judicial 1 courts. They originate solely on" the order of the- Railroad
Commission, and that body uses the Grand Jury and the courts as "an " : instrument of
its "will.- "Â¦:.' := Â¦;'Â¦'Â¦Â¦, : /Â¦-- V *.... Â¦. â¢
/ The issue decided wasin relation to." a recent law of Kentucky. In that .State the
Railroad'. Commission was reduced- to the same flabby and flatulent condition â¢, as
the California Commission. To remedy this the Legislature passed a law against'.extor
tion .in rates and. providing penal and civil remedies. The clause" in .' issue declared that :
"The Circuit Court of any county into or through, which the line or lines' of railroad car- 1 ;
rying such ; passenger or freight], owned /or operated by said road, and the Franklin
Circuit Court, shall have jurisdiction of the! offense and of the railroad company or cor
poration offending, and^ the Circuit Court of the county where such- offense may. be com
mitted by said officer, agent or emrjloye';" shall have ; jurisdiction in' all prosecutions
against said officer, agent or employe." ;;Â¦ , â¢ . . ,:.. ! ; Â¦
ment of. State laws against extortionate freight charges.
THE sentiment pf the s , Supreme Court of the United ' States 'Â¦Â¦! swings like a pen
. dulum,. and.no one can determine the effect of 'one decision upon an issue until
the whole arc has been described anrl_the pendulum is, in' repose.' After shearing

had a long passage and a rough one, and
but for the ingenuity of Captain Bjorkin
gren might be still floundering about the
Pacific. She encountered southeasterly
gales until January 18, when, in latitude
41.39 north, longitude 126.39 west, a snort
ing northwester swooped down on her. In
the battle that followed the schooner's
rudder-post was carried away, and noth
ing but the most skillful seamanship
brought the Antelope out of the conflict.
Captain Bjorkingren then proceeded to
construct a jury steering apparatus,
which yesterday excited the admiration
of all who saw it. It was not only an
ingenious contrivance, but It worked, and
the Antelope reached port with spars and
sails intact and without losing a plank,
of a deck-load of lumber that loomed up
a dozen fee't above her bulwarks.

An interesting foursome was played at
the Coronado links on Tuesday between
Alex Smith, professional, and Mrs. Fred
Green of the San Rafael Golf Club
against J. P. Gardiner, open amateur
champion of Southern California, and
Miss Mary Healy of Coronado, holder of
the ladies* amateur championship. The
score of flve up and four to play In favor
of Smith and Mrs. Green declared them
winners. The by-play of the remaining
four holes gave them a score of nine up
for eighteen holes. All four players put
up- a good game, the play being once
around the elghteen-hole course. Atex

Loven of St. Louis has been declared off.
The kennel of dogs belonging to Hugh
Lynch has been sold and will be run here
after In the name of the Alameda Ken
nels. The string includes some wonder
ful young Â¦ performers, and its sale has
caused considerable surprise. In | taking
out a kennel designation the purchaser le
serves the right to withhold his name. It
Is known, however, that the new owner is
a wealthy resident of Alameda and is a

Black Bart, Melrose Lad, Harvey M,
Clarice. Lilac, Lottie M and J. N. Bow
hay. The latter is by Dakota-Mustie
Maid. Johnny Maher will retain charge
of the kennel.
Another plan which will probably soon
be inaugurated, one which will meet with
the approval of breeders, Is to run more
sapling stakes during the season and bar
a winner in any of these events from
further participating in other stakes of
that class. The idea if carried out will
distribute first, money ! among a greater
number of kennels and prevent a crack
ajack youngster from winning all the
stakes.
The continual display of strength and
speed by the hares liberated in the Held
at Union Park comes at an Inopportune
time for the running of young dogs. To
turn saplings loose against such lively
game would mean the undoing of many
promising youngsters. But few oppor
tunities will be enjoyed by the bettors to
get a line on the quality of the, entries in
the Belle Brandon cup stake by next
month.
With that end in view the organization
delegated its secretary, Charles J. Bag
nail, to visit this city to try to persuide
some owners of high-class greyhounds to
course their dogs throughout the season
at the Capital City grounds.
During the present week Mr. Bagnal!
has communicated with many of the prin
cipal leashmen and offered some flatter
ing terms that he might get them to
transfer their kennels of running dogs to
Sacramento. While the inducements were
acknowledged to be alluring, the persua
sive powers of the genial secretary were
not strong enough to have the local leash
men desert their home fields.
The" game at Los Angeles has had bet
ter luck than Sacramento. The southern
city has during the past two seasons add
ed many first-class coursers to Its ken
nels. Nearly all the dogs were perform
ers whose work had gained them reputa
tions in local coursing. Negotiations have
been pending for some time, between
the association and George Sharman, the
well-known breeder, and a deal has about
been consummated whereby he will es
tablish himself in the south. Final ar
rangements have not yet been made, but
Mr. Sharman has gone to Los Angeles. He

Heretofore only the men students of' the
University of California and Stanford
have taken part in college tennis events,
but the co-eds of the former institution
are anxious to decide who is the best

a. tournament will be held by the ladies
at Berkeley as soon as the weather per

The handicap doubles tournament for
the Davis cups, scheduled for last Sunday,
will be played to-morrow. The present
holders are Chet and Grant Smith. Tho
latter player has won the cups twice with
his brother as a partner and twice wit*i
Ray Cornell. Collier and Crowell lead in
the race for the cups, having their names
on them three times. The Whitney broth
ers have won. them twice, but as they
will not play together except in the cham
pionship event, the race for the cups at
present seems to be between Collier and
Crowell and the Smith brothers. Many
other teams . have their names on the
cups? They are to' be won five times by
the same team before becoming their
properly. They have already been up for
over two years, and it will probably take
two years more to dispose of them.
The ladies of the California Tennis
Club are arranging a mixed doubles tour
nament, -which -will be played next
Wednesday afternoon. Up to six months
ago a mixed doubles tournament was
looked upon by the men players as a
necessary evil, but since the introduction
of a mixed doubles tournament In the
coast championship events this form of
game has become popular. The general
improvement of play tmong the ladies
has done much toward making mixed
doubles tournaments popular.
The following ladies will surely take
part next Wednesday: The Mls3es Hun
ter, i Garland, Farnsworth, Â¦â¢ Salisbury
Whitney, Smith, I. and R. Sherwood
Mecartney, Mrs. Kincald, Mrs. Du Rey
nier. and Mrs. Sherwood. Many other
ladies will probably enter on" the day of
the tournament. All of the best men nlay
ers will be on hand.
This . is the largest number that ever
competed- in a similar event in the bay
counties. Al Rosenberg, the crack player
from Lowell High, will not take part in the
tournament, a place on the team being
conceded to him. He will play a rounJ
robin match with the two players who
reach the finals. Of these three the two
with the highest percentage will repre
sent the school in doubles. , The highest
man, who will undoubtedly be Rosenberg,
will be the representative singles man.
His' partner- in doubles will probably be
Carl Gardner, who seems to outclass the
other players.
Nineteen have entered.
j SOME WELL-KNOWN CHARACTERS AT THE TRACK WHOM THE CARICATURIST HAS CAUGHT IN CHARACTERISTIC POSES. I
On Saturday, February 8, the second
half of the first match over thirty-six
holes -will be played on the links at
Adams Point.
â¢ At last the much-talked-of and long-ex
pected challenge has arrived from the
captain of the Oakland Golf Club, and
the first of the annual series of home
and-heme matches between teams of
Adams Point and Presidio men golfers
will be played next Saturday. As tha
Oaklanders lost the series of home-and
home matches and the silver cup last
year, It devolved upon them to send In a
chaljer.ge this year. The challenge was
delayed by the long drought, which dried
up and hardened the courses, preventing
the greenkeepers from, getting them into
satisfactory condition.
Earlier- in the season there was consid
erable discussion with regard to the num
ber of men to be included in each team.
Some talked of teams of six men, -while
others went as high as twelve. It was
believed tbe Oaklanders. -who on a pre
vious occasion suggested teams of half a
dozen representatives, thought they could
put twelve men into the field this year.
..The argument in favor of large teams
was that room could be found to include
promising players, who, encouraged by
the honor of representing their club,
would jpractice more frequently and faith
fully, and thus raise the level of golf jn
the club. It seems well, however, that a
regular number should be adopted, Just
as for a team in cricket, baseball, foot
ball or other sports. Eight appears a suit
able number, being neither so large as to
be cumbrous or inconvenient nor so small
as to enable a team to win on the
strength of one or two crack players. If
the number were definitely adopted It
would save discussion and would prevent
any suggestion that an attempt was be
ing made to nt the number of men in the
team to the conditions existent in the club
at the moment. In one season it might
happen that a club could find a dozen
good representatives, while in another
year, owing to sickness, absence or other
cause, only half that number might be
available. The Oakland team this year
will be chosen from the following:, E. R.
Folger, F. S. Stratton. R. M. Fitzgerald.
W. P. Johnson. A. H. Higgins, I>. F.
Belden, T. R. Hutchinson, J. A. Folger.
Frank Kales, J. If. Ames and G. E. tie

bot Jr. will make his selection from the
following: John Lawson, B. D. Adamson.

In golf, however, where local peculiari
ties cut so lmpprtant a figure, the-advan
tage is always considerably on the side
of those who are playing on their own
links. It is, therefore, not at all unlikelv
that the San Francisco representatives,
with a complete team and on their own
course, may not only wipe off the balance
of ten holes against them, but may .even
change it to a balance on the other side.
The scores made on both days will be
reckoned together and the winning side
will take the silver cup as a trophy. The
negotiations for the match have been
conducted by Mrs. Laurance T. Scott on
behalf of the San Francisco team, and
by Mrs. P. E. Bowles for the Oakland
golfers.

Oakland team. The San Francisco team
was one player short and consequently
had to give up two points to the Oak
landers. Mrs. R. G. Brown headed the

up against Miss Deane, and Miss McBean

With the possible decline in trap shoot

pistol and revolver practice. It is a com
paratively cheap pastime, a first-class
pistol costing only $14 and cartridges less
than ha!f a cent each.
Some of the enthusiasts at the game af
firm that each year at this time interest
Feems lukewarm, hut with the actual
c-pppinj? of the season the old enthusiasm
revives and battalions of men face the
trnpF and give the sharp command,
"Pull."
From present appearances trap shoot
ing will not have the vogue this season it
has enjoyed for some years past. The
I.lnicln Club has retired from the field
for the present, the members at a recent
ir.eeting deciding not to promote any
{â¢hoots during the season which will soon
cpen. This is one of the oldest pun clubs
on ihe coast and In the past has held
many important F-hoots.
Ed Funk and a friend secured seventy
flve "cans" near Millbrae last Sunday.
They shot from a floating blind neajr the
oyster beds.
Frank Sanborn killed forty-five ducks
In Richardsons Bay last Sunday. H. Ap
piarius killed thirty-eight at the same
place. Both were mixed bags, although
many "cans" were secured.
E. MSldner and J. Struven. shooting in
tho same vicinity, also secured thirty
birds.
At a number of the preserves the mem
bers will meet to-night to celebrate, with
feast and song, the closing of the sea
son. The majority of the sportsmen have
enjoy rd excellent shooting, big bags being
th^ rule for several months past.
, Ed Kcrrlson and Edgar Forster shot
near San Pablo last Sunday aryi bagged
thirty "cans" between them. 1
the preserves about the bay nothing at
which to level their guns. They expect
no Foort to-morrow.
The majoritv of the iren who went out
laft Sunday returned home with empty
game bass. There were no birds down
Mount Eden way and the Alameda Gun
Club men. who have been getting big re
turns on their Sonoma County preserves,
returned empty handed.
The long continued dry spell spoiled the
shooting in the interior, as the majority
cf the birds remained in and about the
bay throughout the entire season. The
county snortsmen will now have their
turn at the --tolrcls. even though it be for
but a short time.

many years, gave a vivid description "of
its many interesting points, carrying the
audience from the slums along the' river
Thames, with Its miles of docks, through
the busy section of the city proper, end

Morley said that although he was un
able to support universal compulsion, he
believed there was urgent need of reopen
ing the land question and that, therefore,
he would support the amendment. He
further asserted he Â¦would vote for any
motion carrying a proposal to confer upon
the Irish people the same right to govern
themselves as Great Britain had given her
colonies. John Redmond's amendment was
rejected by a vote of 237 to 134.
John Morley (Liberal) strongly protested
against the trumpery nature of the cases
utilized to justify the application of co
ercion and said that it was the first time
in nine years that the question of coer
cion had been raised^, and that Atkinson,
in endeavoring to make a case, had ad
mitted there was no serious crime in Ire
land.
The Right Hon. J. Atkinson, Attorney
General lor Ireland, in the course of a
defense of the Government, admitted that
there was no serious crime in Ireland;
that violent crimes there had never been
at such a low ebb, but he said that in
timidation and conspiracy necessitated
the enforcing of the coercion act, because
the juries, had been taught that intimida
tion and conspiracy were not crimes.
The speaker further asserted that the
greatest of all obstacles to a good under
standing between the United States and
Great Britain was the Irish question,
which haunted and which would continue
to haunt Great Britain in all parts of the
world. The Irish members before now
had made ministries and they would make
and unmake more ministries. Landlord
ism in Ireland was doomed. The Govern
ment knew it was beaten all over Ire
land in the question of compulsory land
purchase, and the present debate marked
the commencement of a new epoch in the
progress of Ireland.
O'Connor made a special point of the
recent reception of the Irish delegates in
the United States by President Roosevelt,
who, he said, was in thorough sympathy
with the Irish movement, and by the
Canadian Premier, Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
who, he added, held the same views.
LONDON, Jan. 24.-T. P. O'Connor (Ir
ish Nationalist) made a strong speech in
the House of Commons to-day in support
of John Redmond's amendment of yester
day to the address in reply to the speech
from the throne at the opening of Par
liament. He was frequently cheered.

The fifteen-round bout between Tommy
Gilfeather and Willie Snailham ended iix
a draw. Both men were on their feet at
the end of the bout. The spectators 'ex
pected a decision in favor Gilfeather,
as ne seemed to have done the cleverest
work. He landed stiff blows in - every
round, in one of them succeeding in
knocking his antagonist down with a
right swing. He cleverly blocked nearly
all of Snailham's swings. Snailham was
aggressive and always In the fighting, but
he failed to land telling blows. The first
preliminary was between "Billy" Woods
and "Kid" Harris, both colored men. This
was a burlesque, as Harris could \ not
fight, and hung himself on the ropes,
whenever he got a chance. Woods chased
his man around the ring and hit him so
hard his seconds threw the sponge into
the air in. the fourth round.
In the fourth Flynn landed a vicloua
punch on Irwin's jaw which angered the
latter. He went at Flynn, fought hÂ»m
across the ring and smashed him right
and left on the jaw. He landed four hard*
swings in succession. Flynn did not come
to for twenty minutes and had to be car
ried from the ring. When he revived he
wanted to know whom he had been fight
ing.
Flynn was knocked down three times in
the first round, barely escaping a knock
out at that stage of the proceedings. He
lasted until the fourth round, when Irwin
knocked him out.
- Toby Irwin knocked out "Doc" Flynn
in the fourth round of their fight last
night in the gymnasium of the Reliance
Athletic Club, Oakland. Irwin was the

Eddie Lenny First Man to
Stop the Great
Boxer.
BALTIMORE, Jan, 24.â George Dixon,
the veteran colored featherweight boxer
who held the championship for years,
went down and out under a rain of body
blows delivered by Eddie Lenny to-night
at the Eureka. Athletic Club. Lenny had
the better of the argument throughout.
His blocking rendered it impossible for
the colored man to land a telling blow.
Dixon proved to be shiftier than his old
friends had expected and avoided many
hard leads.
In the ninui round Lenny landed several
hard body blows. When the round was
two-thirds over the men came to a clinch
near the ropes and wrestled to the center
of the ring. Dixon fell to the floor, strik
ing his head and laying open his cheek.
He attempted to rise, but was advised, by
his seconds to take the count, and the
decision was given to Lenny. Dixon was
groggy.
This is the second time in a ring: career
extending over a period of sixteen years
that Dixon has been knocked out. Some
ten years ago, while boxing in Philadel
phia with the "Kentucky Rosebud," the
latter knocked him out unexpectedly.
Tom. O'Rourke. Dixon's second, fixed it
with the timekeepers, and they allowed
him sufficient time in which to collect his
scattered senses.
Dixon, who in his day has earned hun
dreds of thousands of dollars, has been
ekeing out an existence for the past two
years boxing under all manner of condi
tions. He has met a lot of boxers, Lenny
araong others whom he defeated when in
his prime. Heretofore his cleverness has
protected him and he either made it a
draw or lost on points.

committees were appointed to investigate
the two questions of coinage and mining
in the islands, but the full committee will
consider all these questions involved
The sub-committee on coinage is â¢ com
posed of Senators Allison. Beveridge and
Dubois, and that on mining of Senators
McComas, Deitrich and Rawllns.
The investigation will be undertaken for
the purpose of arriving at correct conclu

General Wheaton, commander of lha
Department of the North Philippines,
says men have been. sent to prison here
for remarks; such as those of Professor
Schurmann, and i that if what he advo
cates was accomplished it would mean
the expenditure of much. treasure and the
shedding pfc blood like water. . Now, as
before, he adds, 50,000 soldiers are needed
here and will be required in these islands
for at least 'five years. ; It will then be

MANILA, Jan. 24.â Both the civil and
military authorities here deprecate the
publication in the Philippines of Profes

labus of â the Supreme Court's decision, in
the case of the Nickel Plate Company
against Frank Shaffer, involving' the
"blacklist," which was given out to-day,
sustains the railroad company.
The arguments were begun during tho

She told how her husband, jealous of
Fife and their family physician, had.wnen
under the influence of liquor, made ac
cusations against her. Then as a climax
her attorneys produced a letter written
by Richardson to his wife while ho waa
an inmate of aâ drink-cure institute. It
exonerated the defendant of . the slurs
against her character, 1 acknowledged the
writer's own guilt and begged humbly for
forgiveness. The reading of the letter
proved a sensational bit of evidence. ;
With emphasis she denied all knowledge
of the murder and with snap refuted in
sinuations that her conduct with Stewart
Fife, a clerk in her husband's store and
now awaiting trial himself for complicity
in the crime, had been anything but
proper. : ,
She toid how she had remained at home
alone to fix the Christmas tree for the
children, how when she heard her hus
band approaching she turned the light
low and prepared to surprise him when
he should enter, how the footsteps of two
people had been heard, a moment later
the cry, "Has it come to this?" and then

"Dell" Fountain's horse, Bard Burns, an
8 to 1 shot in the betting, captured the
closing Futurity course sprint in a mild
drive with Formero. Dunblane, the fa
vorite, piloted by Bullman, ran as if he
had never seen a racetrack before, .finish
ing last. ' t * .
Just as he did some four years ago when
a public idol, Pat Morrissey spreadeagled
his field in the mile and a furlong selling
affair. The old fellow was one of the fa
vorites, and with Johnny Woods in the
saddle, never left the result in doubt,
splashing home three lengths before Hun
garian. Siddons ran only a fair third, de
spite O'Connor's hard urging.
A runaway trip to Butchertown in the
morning apparently did not sharpen the
speed of Meehanus, for Caesar Young's
sprinter, with Ransch up, finished third
to Matt Hogan and Captivate in the third
event. He ruled a 3 to 5 favorite and
faded away when called upon in the
stretch, Matt Hogan downing the long
shot two lengths. Sam Fullen displayed
none of his old-time speed. Â¦
Winnie O'Connor started in well by
landing Moabina first for the opening
sprint. The filly closed an 8 to 5 favorite
and, hard ridden at the close, downed
Malaspina a length. Phyllis, a 15 to 1
shot, ran third.
Johnny Daly, seated astride the 90
pounder Legal Maxim, led throughout in
the mile selling run. Seven to 1 could be
had about the Jones' entry, which ran in
four lengths before Bragg and Tyranus,
two of the first choices.
- successes of the day before were
still. fresh in the minds of the men on the
block, and when the blonde young man
went down the line they were as nervous
in handling his coin as Is a bridegroom

stoop shouldered carrying around the
money he won yesterday. He started
well by betting a thousand on Moabina,
and further on won a good bet on Matt
Hogan, but the defeats of Onyx, Gray
feld and Siddons all proved costly and
would have been more so if some of the
pencilers had not been afraid to handle
the wagers proffered them.
The track was in a muddy condition
and horses possessing early speed were
usually the contenders at the wire. Three
favorites won purses, the victory of the
old mud lark, Pat Morrissey, being an
especially popular one.
There was no stopping the brown horse
Kenilworth in the handicap at seven fur
longs, even though " shouldering 126
pounds. Because of a heavy play on
Grayfeld as good as 2 to 1 was at one
time obtainable about Kenilworth. It
proved just like "oil from the can," for
Stover's horse set a clip that made the
others groggy. He won almost easily at
the finish. Grayfeld lost the place to Co

M. Secrestat Jr., the son of a merchant
of Bordeaux, France, arrived at La
Guayra, January 14, with the in
tention of going to Caracas to
protest there against the seizure of
the estates of Matos by the Ven
ezuelan Government the general's prop
erty having been legally leased to M.
Secrestat fc>r. The French Government.
January 16, cabled to Caracas, instructing
the French Consul there to insist that M.
Secrestat Jr. be allowed to land.
PARIS, Jan. 24.â The French Govern
ment this afternoon received a cable mes
sage from the French Consul at Caracas,
Venezuela, announcing that President
Castro has absolutely refused to allow M.
Secrestat Jr. to land,' in- spite of the Con
sul's repeated vigorous protests.
It is claimed that this incident makes it
necessary for the French Government to
take the steps .necessary to cause i?'rench
citizens to be respected and it i3 believed
that the French cruisers Tage and Suchet,
now at Fort de France, will receive orders
to go to La Guayra. The French cruiser
D'fistres is at Carupano, a seaport town
in the State of Bermudese.
Tne Consul made inquiries on the sub
ject which established tne iact that Gen
eral Matos was not at Martinique or Tnii
idad when the St. Laurent Â«toUched at
those islands, but was off tne Venezuelan
coast on board the revolutionist steamer
La Libertador. All the passengers of the
St. Laurent and notably the secretary of
the Spanish legation at Caracas assert
that tne behavior of Secrestat was always
most correct and tnat he did not see
Matos. . . â¢
. It is held by the authorities that while
the French line steamer St. Laurent, on
which Secrestat was a. passenger, was at
Fort de France, island of Martinique, or
at the island of Trinidad, he conferred
â¢with General Matos, . the revolutionary
leader.'
WILLEMSTAD, island of Curacao, Jan.
24.â In spite of the protests made by the
French Consul here President Castro has
sustained the action of the Venezuelan
authorities at La. Guayra, who refused to
permit M. Secrestat Jr. of Bordeaux to
land, although the Government had pre
viously assured the Consul that the trav
eler might debark.

She says: "Grape-Xuts has done so
much for me. When I came out of school
I was broken down In health from over-
work and nervousness. Every summer
during the hot weather I have been prac-
tically exhausted and generally have lost
Jive pounds or over.
"Quite by accident I began using Grape-
Kuts and thought I liked it very much at
first, but the taste grew on me so much
that I am extravagantly fond of It. I ate
it all last summer and was surprised to
find that, I kept up with plenty of
strength, my nerve force increased, and I
lost no flesh.
"I know exactly â¢what has sustained inc.

never tire of it I always use it with cold

Nearly everybody in Belleville, 111. felt

KANSAS 'CITY, Jan. 24âWhat is be
lleved to have beea an earthquake shock
was experienced in the northeast extrem
ity of the city early this morning. The
movement was slight and no damage re-
"I was awakened suddenly about 4:15
a. m. I first heard a slight rumbling.
Then the house trembled. Finally so
great was the vibration that all the mem
bers of the family got ready to take to
the street. Everything in the house that
could give forth a sound aided the din
It seemed as if the shock lasted a min
ute. It was very severe."
Dr. Hyatt, the local Weather Bureau
chief, says an acquaintance of his from
Clifton Heights reported that the shocks
there were very severe and several per
sons went into their yards, fearing the
houses would be shaken down. The
shocks were felt distinctly in the tri-citic3
across the river, in Illinois. In Venice
buildings shook and windows rattled so
that residents believed an explosion had
occurred in the neighborhood.
QUINCY. 111., Jan. 24.â There was a
pronounced earthquake here at 4:40 thl*
morning. The seismic disturbance lasted
nearly a minute and the oscillation was
from east to west. The shaking of walls
was perceptible in many brick residences.
The earthquake was felt very distinctly
at Alton. .111. In the west end of that
city, on the bluffs, the vibration was most
severe. Captain D. S. Parks^ who lives in
Bluffs, said:
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Jan. 24.â Two distinct
shocks of earthquake were' felt In St.
Louis and vicinity this morning. The first
shock was light. The second was more
severe. It awakened persons who had
slept through the first shock and got
them out of bed. The shocks were ac
companied by a rumbling sound and oc
casioned the rattling ' of crockery and
swinging of pictures.

OLTMPIA, Wash., Jan. 24.â Governor
McBride to-day issued a proclamation op
posing .the railroad merger under the
name of the Northern Securities Com
pany. Governor McBride . declares the
community of Interest in the operation of
railroads is dangerous, because of the in
security of individuals making it up. Such
community of Interest, he says, stifles
competition, which is the only protection
in this State against railroads. The Gov
ernor declares that the people should pre
pare to enforce their rights and should
act for their own protection, whether the
present suit in Minnesota stands or falls.
It continues: - v ..^ â¢:Â¦
"Suppose the Injunction prayed for
should be granted, is the danger at an
end? If the same parties own or control
a majority of the stock of â¢ the Great
Northern and Northern Pacific, what is
to prevent them throttling all competi
tion? The destruction of the Northern
Securities Company, if that can be accom
plished, would be a step in the right di
rection, .but would not, . in my judgment,
be a complete cure for the threatened
evil."
Judge Hall rendered his decision in the
case of Bernard Noy of Alameda, who Is
suing his wife. Freda Noy, for divorce on
the ground that she was recreant In her
wifely duties. ' One of the Incidental
charges contained in the complaint is that
Mrs. Noy frequently absented hersolf
from home at night without Informing
her husband where she was going. To thl3
allegation Attorney R. B. Tappan of Ala
meda took exception.
"I maintain," he said, while presenting
the matter to Judge Hall, "that a wife
has got as much right to stay away from
home as a husband. Husbands frequently
stay away from home at night and they
sometimes forget to tell their wives about
it. Now, why hasn't a wife just as much
right to do that thing as her spouse?"
"But they don't represent that they
have been at one place when they have
been at another," replied Attorney M. W.
Simpson, â¢ representing the husband.
"Well, she might have told an untruth,
but that doesn't curtail her rights in the
least. Husbands who stay out all night
don't always take the trouble to tell their
wives the truth.": Â¦>-.-â¢-;
"It is my opinion that Mr. Tappan Is"
right in this matter," said Judge Hali. "I
agree with him that a wife has as much
right to stay out nights as her husband,
and unless they have an understanding it
is not necessary that they inform each
other where they are going to spend the
evening." .'./.'
The court sustained Tappan's demurrer
on that point, but said the decision did
not go to the main charge of the com
plaint. :
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Jan. 24.
Under a ruling made by Judge Hall to
day wives have just as much right to stay
out nights as their husbands. He docs
not think that there should be any dis
tinctions between the pne or the other,
and if one stays out the other has a per
fect right to do so, too. They needn't
tell each other where they are going or
where they are staying, either.
We have not heard from him for over a
month, which fact has caused me some uneasi

writing home weekly.
I do not know of any reason why he should
be despondent or wish to end his life.
George met his brother Ed In Sacramento a
short time agp and to him he said they would
never meet again, as he (George) was going to
commit suicide.- As he was intoxicated at the
time no attention was paid to his statements.
When drinking he is not responsible for what
he says, but when sober is quiet and indus
trious.
It is not at all unlikely that he would be in
Oakland or that he would make threats to take
his life, as he is In the habit of roaming around
to different places after working a while and
at such times drinks heavily until his money
is cone.
I have two sons who are not at home at
present, but I think the one referred* to is
George W. Baldwin Jr.. who is my eldest son,
but to my knowledge he has not been living
in Oakland. The last time we heard from him
he was working In a copper mine at Lancha
Plana, Amador County, where he had been for
some â¢ time.
The landlady at the Vendome has only
an indistinct recollection of the young
man's appearance, save that he was tall
and of fairly good address. She was so
much impressed, however, by his ex
tremely melancholy manner that she had
a. premonition of some evil impending
over him, which she recalled on opening
the letter. The missive has been held at
the hotel office, as is the custom of the
house in such cases, awaiting a claimant.
So far the police have discovered no clew
to the young man's .identity."
The Morgue records furnish no clew
to the mysterious stranger's identity. No
unidentified bodies have been taken to

George W. Baldwin Sr., who is men
tioned in the foregoing letter as the writ

Nevada City.' He was greatly surprised.
He said:
This is my last letter on this earth. I know
it will kill you. Good-by, dear father, and all
I hope is that I will cee you in the other land.
The stranger called at the hotel late on
the night of the 7th inst., and said that
all the money he had in the world was 20
cents. He asked if he could get a bed
for that amount. Taking pity on his for
lorn appearance, the landlady allowed
him to stay. In the morning after he
left the letter was found on the bureau
and taken to the office. It was opened
to-day and at once taken to police head
quarters. The envelope bears the address,
"George W. Baldwin. Nevada City, Cal."
and the letter is as follows:
OAKLAND.
Dear Father: I am discouraged. I know I
will never see your dear face on this earth
again. I am ready to commit a great crime.
I have worked hard all the days of my life,
dear father. Now I am going to take my life,
and foreive me for the first' time I have done
wrong. I have grot a few things at Wallace in
Calaveras County, in the care of James Good
man. Tou write to him for the things and he
will send them to you, dear father.
This is my last day on this earth. I hope
that we will meet in heaven. I know that it
will kill you, but this has to be done.
From your lost and loving son. '

In ail his statements Strother has not

This confession was made after a se

When the stage reached " Deadwood
Camp, made famous by the rich Brown
Bear mine of the late Henry Martin, the
driver and passengers dismounted while j
the mail and. express were being trans
ferred. Stiller stepped behind the station
building. Owing to his peculiar actions
his absence caused alarm and he was fol
lowed. At the rear of the structure he
was found tugging at a pocket knife,
which he had already plunged as far as
possible into his neck. He was trying to
pull it entirely across his throat, from
which Wood was spurting.
The combined ettorts of five men were
necessary to overpower the struggling
man, . bent on self-destruction. Mrs. Stil
ler rode throughout the night to the bed
side of her husband and will take him to
Redding for further medical attention.
Stiller is one of the best-known men in
Trinity County and has been County
Treasurer for three successive terms.
Stiller, who has a wife and two young
children, went to Kedding on "Wednesday
evening. He told acquaintances f there
that his health had been so wretched of
late that he intended gd*ing to Honolulu
on a pleasure trip. Before the train for
San Francisco arrived 'that night he
changed his mind and on Thursday morn
ing he boarded the stage for Weaverville.
His peculiar Â¦ actions on the return trip
caused Driver A. W. Sleeper and his fel
low passengers some little â¢wonder and
led them to pay particular attention to
him. " â¢ . . â¢
WEAVERVILLE, Jan. 24.â Because of
ill health, It is claimed, Richard W. Stil
ler, Treasurer of Trinity County, cashier
of the Trinity County Bank here and
agent for the Wells-Fargo Express Com
pany, attempted . to commit suicide yes
terday afternoon at Deadwood, while
presumably suffering from dementia. He
drove the dull blade of a pocket knife "to
the hilt into the right side of his neck,
missing the jugular vein by only a small
fraction of an inch. He was attempting
to draw the blade through the muscles
of his .throat when overpowered and dis
armed. He probably will recover. .As
far as can be learned . Stiller' s extensive
accounts are correct. '^ ,'- 7:'

There is a growing belief that the con
ference is approaching a basis, of agree
ment on the most important points at
issue. France and Great Britain are cer
tainly striving to neutralize the effects of
the bounty sy6tem.
Just what fresh influence these dele
gates have brought to bear since the re
cess it is impossible to set forth, but the
fact that the perfunctory official state
ment of to-day's proceedings alludes to
the advisability of an international board
to oversee and enforce what regulations
are enacted by the conference indicates
the probability of an agreement of some
sort before adjournment.
BRUSSELS, Jan. 24.â The indications
now point to a continuation of the ses
sions of the international sugar confer
ence for a fortnight at least.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.â The treaty of
cession of the Danish West Indian Islands
from Denmark to the United States was
signed at the State Department to-day
by Secretary Hay and Constantin Brune,
the Danish Minister. The treaty will be
submitted to the Senate for ratification
immediately.
Following the invariable rule In such
cases, the State Department officials de
cline to make public any of the details
of the treaty, so it is impossible to state
definitely the price to be paid, though
this ia believed to be in the neighborhood
of Ej,0CO,Câ¬O. It is known also that Den
mark has abandoned the position she was
inclined to occupy toward the conserva
tion of the political rights of the inhab
itants of the island and leaves to the
United States & free hand to deal 'with
them, without .pledge of American citi
zenship or of free trade privileges.
So It is assumed that the status of the
Danish West Indian Islands politically,
should the treaty be ratified, will be sim
ilar to that of Porto Rico. Having gained
these points in the negotiations, the State
Department officials believe the treaty 13
certain to receive the approval of the
United States Senate. Â¦
The new treaty is peculiar in that It will
require action not only by the Senate and
the Danish Rigsdag, but by the United
States House of Representatives as well,
since it will be necessary for the House
*to supply the needed appropriation to
defray the expense of purchase. It is re
garded as a strong point by the framers
of the treaty that the people of the Dan
ish West Indies are to have a voice in. thia
i question of cession.
The treaty itself does not contain any
reference to a plebiscite, but the Dantsh
Government has given notice that before
it ratifies the treaty it will submit the
question of cession to the people of the
islands. Not much objection is expected
i here from these people, as the treaty is so
framed that they are not called on to sur
render their Danish allegiance and they
may remain Danes in fact and in name,
â¢while enjoying -whatever advantages in
a commercial way that may result from
a transfer cf the Islands to the United
States.

the continued steadiness of "prices, < though

on continued confidence in . future .values and
the very heavy export movement now going on,

NEW YORK, Jan. 24.â There were attempts
to hold the market by the marking up of in
dividual etocks, which proved successful until
the uneasiness of the professionals to take
their profits checked the advance. The whole
market then reacted, dropping generally to
Â¦well below last night. There was another.up
ward movement when shorts covered. : which
leduced the day's net changes to insignificant
proportions, but made th* nosing firm. Fully
one-third of the day'* transactions were In
Sugar and Amalgamated Copper. Except for
these there were not hair a dozen stocks in
which the transactions- amounted to 10,000
ehares. The dealings in Sugar were on a very
large scale, with no news to account for them
beyond the general expectation of a reduction
in the duties on Cuban sugars. This stock was
lifted nearly 2 points, but fell back to below
last night's level and also closed unchanged.
Amalgamated Copper fared better, the late
recovery carrying it back to 72%, the best of
the day, and at a net advance of 1%. The
buying was apparently by a speculative pool,
who cited the strength of coppers In foreign
markets as an argument in its favor. There
were also reports of improved trade conditions
as indicated by the good demand for raw cop
per in Europe and reports of large export de
mand h^re. Rumors of an agreement to re
strict the output of American producers ac
companied the advance. The strength of
American Smelting was supposed to be In sym
pathy. The Wabash stock and Western
Union were notably firm, and People's Gas
showed some strength from the declaration of
the regular quarterly dividend. There was no
news during the day to explain the reactionary
tendency which developed, which, therefore,
must be credited to profit taking. The reports
of, very cold weather threatening in the West
may have had a somewhat depressing Influence,
as it had a strengthening influence on wheat.
The Bitting of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission on the matter of railroad combinations
was the subject of discussion and may have
had a depressing effect. The preliminary
figures of the week's cash movements were as
good as expected. Indicating a gain by the
banks of nearly $7,000,000 In cash, of which
BUbtreasury operations yielded $2,378,000. The
loan item offers the usual puzzle, but the de
cline In interest rates and the known fact that
interior banks have been lenders In New York
detract " from the , supposition of any large
loan expansion. â¢
The bond market continued quite active to
day, but profit taking made Its Impress there
as well. as in etocks. Thtre were come newly
active issues, on the other hand, which were

sence of demand bslng the principal cause.
Chicago was somewhat firmer with more dis
position to buy. The country again appeared
as buyers, -which was a strong factor, and the
brokers were full of buying orders at a shade
under the market. There was a large specu
lative Â¦ trade, and the commission houses were
moderate. buyers, though they did a heavy trade
on -both Â¦Â¦ sides of the' market. St. Louis re
ported an excellent buying- demand. The ex

the upper grades. Cheese is still struggling
under heavy stocks. â¢ Eggs continue to arrive
freely.* but seem to be holding their own at

Canada against 4C last year. . â
Hesitation is general in the markets for sta-'
pie products. There is no longer the reckless,
buoyancy so conspicuous a short time ago. Dis
aster to one prominent operator had a. calming
influence and in the case of corn the insignifi
cant exports cannot- well be entirely ignored.
Foreign buying of wheat," 1 flour included, is
much Â¦ more liberal, Â¦ all ports of the -United
States sending out 4.320.005 bushels during the
past week, compared with 4,038,481 bushels a
year ago. , Meats have weakened and dairy
products are 1 also less inflated. Raw/ sugar
stiffened owing to restricted arrivals, which
are natural since Cuban holders await favor
able tariff arrangements and bounty discus
sions affect conditions in Europe.
NEW YORK. Jan. 24.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of > Trade to-morrow will say:
Little of a. novel nature: has developed in the
business or financial situation during the past
week. Conditions of the - preceding week were
accentuated as- a rule; â¢ active manufacturing
plants becoming still, more . busily engaged,
while the downward tendency of prices was not
checked. Retail trade is of immense volume
and jobbers have immense spring orders to fill.
Western cities send the most satisfactory re
turns, but nearly all sections, are Â¦ enjoying
wholesome activity, even j the â¢ South . showing
evidence of Improvement. Wages , were volun
tarily advanced. at a number of manufacturing
plants and hours reduced at others. There were
few labor controversies, .while skilledÂ«work
men are in greater demand than supply.

ments. Prices remain unchanged as competi

would be Immediately checked by fuel oil.
which Is yet being offered at prices which coat
cannot reach. There has been a sharp de
mand for several weeks past for fuel for house
purposes^ â stoves and gratesâ and popular
grades are almost unprocurable, even at ex
treme prices. This scarcity of suitable domes
tic coal 13 forcing consumers to utilize gas
stoves and heaters. Freights from Australia
still remain low and Importers are offering
Colonial products at reduced quotations.
Freights from Swansea and Cardiff are stiffen
ing a little, hence very few coal orders are
going forward. Contracts for oil arÂ» being
freely made, extending over long periods, at
prices which favor the consumers more than
the producers. The former are well aware of
the number of companies that have capped
their wells, not finding customers for their out
put â this Justifies their buying only at seduct
ive figures. "

vertiser" s Â¦ London financial - cablegram says : j
| The approaching settlement has a tendency
to check new ventures In ! the â¢ stock â¢ market
and at the eame time -to induce some realiza
tion. Investment shares are hardening on
prcepects of I dearer money. Americans were
idle, but New York bid prices up fractionally.
The argument that is used here is that a ver "
<l!ct sustaining .the .legality of _ the Northern
Securities Company deal would not stimulate
public buying, while a verdict against the con
solidation scheme might mean a 10- point drop
in the stocks of ,the constituent companies.
The feature was Rio Tintos, which. spurted to
4.5% and closed at 43%. Copper rose only
>4. but the market thinks the corner has been
turned. - The leading Rio Tintos official sailed
for America on Wednesday, presumably to ar
range some terms with Amalgamated Copper.

POLICE PREVENT
HEATHEN CRIME
Judge Frank H/fDunne 'of the Superior
Court has temporized with an absolute
order of .the'. Supreme Court of Califor
nia, and according to. the; statement of
Attorney . George [ D. Collins, is in immi
nent clanger of being cited Â»f or contempt
to-day. The lawyers of San Francisco
j were eagerly discussing the matter about
town ?as?t night and great is the specula
tion as to what will be the outcome of
the unusual action of the Superior Judge.
Attorney Collins states positively that if
Judge Dunne does not comply with the
<rder at 10 o'clock to-day he will be
under arrest by noon. â - * â¢â¢ â¢
The Difficulty arose from the Supreme
Court's reversal of the judgment of the
Supericr Court denying a new trial to
Fred Hansted, more familiarly known as
"Professor Young Dutchy," who was con
victed of complicity in the attempt to
loot the Sullivan estate. The Supreme
Court held that the indictment was de
fective and ordered that the defendant be
set free. According to the statutes, a
judgment of the court does not go Into
effect for thirty days. â ~j
The proscribed time elapsed on Thurs
day and Justices McFarland, Temple and
Henshaw issued the following order on
that day:
Directs Hansted's Helease.
People of the State of* California, respond
ent, vs. F. Hansted, appellant. In the above
entitled caus=e the court, having, on the 23<1
<lay of December, A. D. 1901, reversed the
judgment of the Superior Court in and for the
city and county of San Francisco, State of
California, with directions to that court to
eustain the motion to set aside the indictment,
and it appsMring that the defendant is In cus
tody under the Judgment of eaid Superior
Court, now, therefore, pursuant to the re
quirements of section 12<J2 of the Penal Code
of the State of California, it is ordered that
upon the filing of the remlttiiur upon eald
judgment of reversal. In the said Superior
Court, that the said court be. and it hereby Is,
directed to discharge the said defendant V.
Hansted from custody.
This order was immediately transmitted
- to Judge Dunne on Thursday, but regarQ
less of the vehement protests of Attorney
Collins, who represents Hansted. the.mat
ter was laid over until yesterday. The
lawyers, all agreo that an order from the
Supreme Court must be cbeyed instantly
rnd without question and they are at a
Â¦ loss to understand why Judge Dunne did
not act immediately. The case was set
for yesterday morning and Attorney Col
lins was on hand to demand the release
of his client, but Assistant â¢ District At
torney Greany. who represented the pros
ecution, .asked that he be given time to
look into the matter. This the court
agreed to, but on objection by Collins,
he said that the case was not continued
but action was simply flelayed.
Charg-es Dunne With Contempt.
Collins then charged Judge Dunne "with
contempt on the ground that failure to
obey the order was equivalent to dis
obedience. .The Judge objected and or
dered the case set for to-day.
Attorney Collins' said last night:
Judge Dunne felt sore, I think, because the
Supreme Court reversed him. \Vhy he' does
net obey the order of the higher court. > how
ever, is more than I I or anybody else who
knows anything about law can understand. - It
is a case of contempt, pure and simple. I will
let the matter drop if he orders Hansted's
release to-morrow, because I think the ethics of
the profession demand it. I told him that
I would wait for him if it should be distinctly
understood that I was net a party to the
transaction. But I let him understand â and
I meant what I said â that I would net stand
for any further postponement of action after
10 o'clock to-morrow. If he does not come
to time at 10 o'clock he will be under arrest
by noon.
Justice McFarland, who as the head
of . Department No. 2 of the Supreme
Court, Issued the order, stated that he
did not care to talk of the matter until
it had been brought to his attention offi
cially. "I will say," he vouchsafed, how
ever, "that the action of the Judge Is
unusual."

election,. and also, accused him of-Incom
petence, and unfairness to some of the
.men who worked- under him.^ ' :; > V â¢Â¦Â¦
Ex-President Reagan of the Pavers'
Union, who" was a > candidate for the post-,
tion .-held - by . Gallagher, was the % active
man in Â¦â¢ the 'prosecution of 'the charges
filed against Gallagher.- An ; attorney was
secured at the last 1 minute by Reagan, and
his; mode' of conducting the examination
of.. witnesses gave the investigation a dis
tinctcomic opera air.' ' --Â¦Â¦-Â¦. 'Â¦' â¢ ,Â¦
The legal representatives of Gallagher,
did nothing for their client outside of
filing exceptions. All the witnesses
The police- officers who assisted in the,
arrest of William Buckley for the murder
of , George Rice, a non-union machinist,
oh '.the night of October 11 last, had j their
innings in! Judge La wlor's ..court yester
day .--/They gave their testimony with the
same" degree .of positiveness exhibited at
the preliminary, examination ;of :the â¢. ac
cused,'and; the efforts of the attorneys
for the defense were directed to the task
of securing 'contradictions." This proced
ure : provoked some! bitter .controversies
between counsel. â¢ . ,
; : Charles W. Brown," the officer who ar
rested Buckley as. he was running from
the scene -of'the shooting, occupied the
stand . throughout the morning session.
He denied positively that any! one had
said in his hearing that he (Brown) had
arrested , the wrong man, although at the
preliminary :* examination he . admitted
such a statement might have been made.
He also testified to having had a : con
versation with Buckley in which the pris
oner first denied that he was at the scene
of the shooting, "but subsequently admit
ted that- he was. Buckley stated. to the
witness .that he ran away after Rice was
shot because he feared to get into trouble.
.Police Sergeant Thomas S. Duke testi
fied to having talked with the defendant
at the, police station, at which time Buck
ley made contradictory -statements as to
his . reasons "â¢ for Â¦ being in ' the vicinity of
Howard.. and Twentieth streets on â¢ the
night of '.the shooting. Later the witness
went to.the 'County Hospital, where he
took Rice's dying statement, in .- which
the allegation â¢ was made that the man
who 'did the *. shooting . wore â¢ a : light hat. '
When the witness saw Buckley y- again
Buckley told htm an absurd story <^f hav
ing seen two strangers , who were going to
do up, a. "scab."'
Duke was severely .cross-examined 'and
the result waa frequent displays of .tem
per among .counsel .which the court was
called. upon to suppress. \ â*
Lieutenant. William Price testified con
cerning the contradictory stories told* by
Buckley, and Officer Edward H. .Mills tes
tified that -Buckley Informed him that >t
Rice died he (Buckley) "would Hoe placed
in a very bad position.'" , / ,.</
The : trial will be resumed .Monday, - at
which time it is expected -that Some inter
