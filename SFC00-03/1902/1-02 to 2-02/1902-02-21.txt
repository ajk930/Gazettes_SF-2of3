The Government declines to publish
figures of the casualties in the riots of
Tuesday and Wednesday. It is inferred
from private information received here
that; forty persons were killed and 200
wounded during the encounter of those
days, and that 500 arrests have been
ma6V. Alt persons who were slightly
wounded were concealed by their friends
in order to avoid prosecution.'
One hopeful sign is the fact that al
most alone among the Ministers and gov
erning authorities General Weyler is in
sympathy with the Catalonian demands
and Is inclined to study their grievances.
He has held military commands in Cata
lonia, speaks the Catalan language and
thoroughly understands the situation.
WEYLER IN SYMPATHY.
Owing to the strict censorship over
news from Barcelona it is difficult to as
certain the real state of affairs there. It
is quite certain, however, that all the
efforts of the authorities to persuade the
labor leaders into a conciliatory attitude
have so far failed, and the extension of
the strike movement is more likely than
it3 restriction. In. addition to the labor
movement the ever-present Catalan home
rule agitation is likely to prove a. se
rious factor in the situation.
Official telegrams received here describe
a slight Improvement in the situation at
Barcelona, and .officials to-night seem
more hopeful.
It is learned late to-night that martial
law has been proclaimed at Nanresa
(about thirty miles northwest of Barce
lona), and at Saragossa. At the latter
place the troops have occupied a strat
egic position in order to check the dis
turbances. .
A Â¦ strike commenced" at Valencia, but,
owing tb the refusal of the dock labor'
ers to participate it did not become gen
eral. The police at Valencia, assisted by
the troops, have up to the present time
been able to maintain order there.
At Saragossa most of the factories have
already closed on the demands of the
workmen and the strikers are bringing
pressure to bear to compel the factories
still remaining open to close their doors.
The captain general of Saragossa has
Â¦wired for reinforcements.

inside information, that the Supreme Court
of the United States would throw out the
Minnesota Â¦-Â¦, case. This ' is^largely guess

ROME, Feb. 20.â The Pope to-day en
tered on the twenty-fifth year of his
pontificate. Although the main celebra
tion, of the jubilee is postponed until
March 3, when the combined festivals of
the jubilee and coronation- will' be . ob

â¢ FIERCE BATTLE IS FOUGHT BETWEEN TROOPS AND STRIKERS.
SOME unknown person fireda bul
let through the bedroom window
of the residence of Policeman
Daniel Â¦ Sylvester at 1049 York
street at an early hour yesterday
morning, and the recipient of this mark'ed
attention \ is convinced that an attempt
was made to assassinate him. After bor
ing a hole in the window the bullet flat
tened itself against the wall and fell to
the lioor, where it was picked up. Syl
vester had Just retired for the night
when the shot was fired. He arose aid
made an investigation, but was unable-tb
find any traces of the man behind\ ths
gun. . Y 'Â¦Â¦. .
The bedroom is on. the second floor pf
the dwelling, and it was the top window
lighi that was broken. The bullet mark
on the wall is on a line with the hole in
the-window light,; which indicates that
the shot was fired from 'some place on^a
level . with the bedroom window. There
are only two - orjthree houses of th&t
height in the vicinity, and it ia supposed
the bullet came from one of these. The
policeman was -taken off his beat on
O'Farrell .-, street yesterday afternoon arid
given-a special detail to investigate ' the
and ascertain if possible the
identity of -the person who fired the shot.-
Sylvester is not popular with "de gang"
in the neighborhood where he lives. Ther^
is said to be a- crowd of-toiigh hoodlums
living out i' that way that has a strong
antipathy * toward policemen in, general
and this officer in particular. Last New
Year's night Mrs. Sylvester gave a little
entertainment to some > friends. Â¦ John
Dougherty and Daniel McLaughlin were
not told to stay away, so they concluded
they had an invitation %nd insisted on at
tending. . Sylvester ejected them . finally
and then they went outside and broke the
- front windows with cobblestones. SyK
vester arrested them, but the* charge. was
dismissed. : Both are well known to the
police, â¢ and McLaughlln is now in Jail ,
awaiting trial' on a charge of assault.

Disposal of the Schley
Case Leaves Him at
- -
Belief Is Expressed That He
Will Remain in Offica
Until Autumn.
. Â¦ . . .
WASHINGTON. Feb. 20.â Now that the
Schley matter has been settled officially,
it is understood that Secretary Long feels
he is at liberty to carry out the project
cherished by him to retire to 'private life.
However, this is not expected to ensue at
once, for there is no certain knowledge of
what may follow in Congress, notwith-
EtanCing a slrorg belief by tlue adminis
tration that the case is settled beyond re
vival. Therefore, it is understood that the
change in the Cabinet circle will' not take
place before the adjournment of Congress,
and perhape not until next autumn.
Secretary Long, referring to the Presi
dent's statements upon the appeal of Ad
miral Schley to-day, said; j. : > ;'
I have no comment to make oa the Presi
dent's rulny? upon the appaa.1 cf Admiral
Schley. except to ex?nm.= my appreciation of ius
thorough. ccnsoientioUE, straightforward char
acter. It is. of course, gratifying that the
Navy Department is sustained. â¢' The decision
will be read as no other document would be,
end I believe will direct public cpinicn and tend
to clcse the whole rnatter. . Â¦
Secretary Long has received the follow
ing personal note from the White House,
announcing the President's action in the
case of Adir.iral Scfcley: - .

LORD PAUNCEFOTE CALLS
â¢ AT STATE DEPARTMENT
Arranges With Secretary Hay for the
Final Ratification of the New
Treaty. . ..v-V
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.â Lord Paunce
fote v.'as at the State Department to-flay,
and it has been arranged between hisi
self and Secretary Hay that the rinal
ratifications of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty
' shall be exchanged here as soon as the
mechanical work of pressing the exchange
copies can be executed. The British Gov
ernment has conveyed to its Kmbassador
full authority to conclude this arrange
ment.
Mr. Brun, the Danish Minister, also saw
Secretary Hay in relation to the ratifica
tion of the treaty lor the cession to the
United States of the Danish West Indian
islands. It seems improbable now that
the mooted plebiscite of the inhabitants
of the islands will be bad by the Danish
Government. However, should It be . de
cided otherwise, the taking of the vote
will be a very small matter, . inasmuch
as the franchise is enjoyed in the Danish
West Indies by, only a few hundred of the
total population, and their votes could 'Â¦
be recorded in a day or two. It will not
be necessary to wait upon Congress for
the appropriation of $S,O<X!,C0O as a- 'pre 7 
liminary to the acquisition of the islands
by the United States. Under the treaty, i
as soon as the ratifications are exchanged ;
the United States nag will be hoisted and :
tiie $5,000,000, if not already appropriated,
Â¦will be charged up against tne United
States as a debt.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 20.â Justice Hor

fered an attack of paralysis, but it is
stated that there is every " reason to ex

Tuesday night. His mind is â¢ clear, but he
has lost the " muscular control of a part
of his body. Justice Gray had been un
well for some time and at his advanced
age, : 74 years, gave rise to some appre
hension as to. the outcome, although his
family says the attack is not serious.

I TEAR THAT THE BBIGANDSv^-J
HAVE KULLED CAPTIVES
Sliss Stone and Her Companion
Should Have Been Beleased
Several Days Ago.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.â Grave fears
are entertained at -the State Department
that Miss Stone will not be rescued alive.
These fears are based upon the fact that
fifteen days have elapsed since the ran
som for her freedom was paid to the
brigands. They had promised that she
would be released within ten days. Ac
cording to the latest official advices in the
possession of Secretary Hay the woman
has not yet been released. â¢
Not having made any demand for im
munity from punishment, the brigands ap
preciate that it is the purpose of the
United States to insist upon their appre
hension and imprisonment once Miss
Stone is released. Miss Stone and Mme.
Tslika are the only persons who will be
able to swear positively to their identity.
It was suggested to-day that they have
considered it wise to put them out of the
way. now that they have received the
566,000. If any harm ! has befallen the
women an immediate demand for repara
tion will be made upon Bulgaria and Tur
key, also, if necessary.
Young Soosevelt Is Improving.
GROTON, Mass., Feb. 20.â The condition
. of Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was pronounced
excellent to-day and the arrival of Dr. P.
M. Rixey, the President's medical adviser,
from Washington, -was the only feature of
interest here. While the progress of the
sick- boy' has been satisfactory in every
respect, Mrs. Roosevelt is unwilling to
take any step which might prove detri
mental to him and expresses a doubt if
she will start for Washington with the
lad before Saturday.
Turkish Government Pays Indemnity
. CONSTANTINOPLE, Feb. 20.â The
Turkish Government's, methods of saving
expenses have again been exemplified by
the payment.of Indemnities due to British
subjects under the guise of improving the
navy. Out cf Â£108.000 just paid to the
Armstrongs on account of a contract for
a new cruiser Â£64,000 was handed over *o
the officials of the British Embassy to
pay indemnities.
Being Tried -for High Treason.
; CONSTANTINOPLE, Feb. 20.â The trial
of General Osman Pasha on the charge of
high treason began to-day behind closed
doors. Osman, who is a son of the famous
Kurdish chief, Bedrahan Pasha fled to
Europe and thence to Cairo, but he was
Induced to return to Constantinople by the
Sultan's promise of pardon; ' On arriving
here Osman was immediately arrested.
to-day, has positively no present Inten
tion of making a general war upon the
great industrial combinations like the
eteel trust and kindred corporations. The
President frankly admits that there is
much that may be good in the combina
tions that have grown up out of our vast
industrial. development. He has said that
there may be much that is bad if thesa
combinations "become Unmindful of their
duty to the public. His remedy is puo
licity, which he advocated with such force
in his message. , He wants that tested be
fore he thinks of shootingHiagara by an
attack â¢ on j the whole -industrial-- system.
There has been a' discussion here to-day
as to whether under "the present law the
United: States can succeed in breaking up
the : -Northern Securities combination.
Most lawyers are willing to take- the
opinion Â¦>Â¦ of . the Attorney- . General that
under.vthe, Sherman act the combination
is "clearly illegal." â¢ Â¦ .. ... ..--.
Â¦- On the other hand it is pointed out that
this -is -entirely a new 'form, of combina
tion-of which. there has been no decision
by the Supereme Court. In the Addystone
Company v^pipe j case the Supreme Court
broke up the combination S of manufac
turers in which each concern retained its
identity, but who made an* agreement to
restrict trade, raise prices and destroy
competition.
; No Precedent for Present Case.
In the -case of the trans-Missouri
Freight Association the court held that
the numerous railroads which entered
into an agreement to maintain the rates
on all freight traffic were violating the
law, because the contracts were in re
straint of trade. On the other hand, the
court held in the case of the E. C. Knight
Sugar Refining Company, which was
bought up by -the sugar trust, that the
sugar trust could buy up all the refineries
in the country, because the regulation of
commerce applied to the "subjects of
commerce," and not to matters of inter
nal policy. The court failed to see thai
there was any restraint of -"commerce",
la restraining. the production." All these
cases differ from the present one. In tho
present contention the Great Northern
and Northern Pacific roads have not con
solidated. One has not bought out the
other. But the controlling interests in
both have been vested in an entirely inde
pendent company f.ormed . for . the purpo3Â»
of taking over the properties. It is held
by some lawyers that the court must de-
clde that this Is a matter which court*
ha 7^? ? othln S to do with. Others agree
with Attorney General Knox that the
very formation of the Northern Securities
Company to control these two roads la &
combination and must necessarily be In
restraint of trade and Interstate com-
According to a. lawyer who has In tha
service of the Government had much to

that the discussion of the matter precipi
tated by the announcement of the Attor
ney General will lead to a very earnest
effort to get immediate action in Con
gress. The statement was positively
made that the Judiciary Committee of
the House would report favorably once

Just what Judge Harris desired his
hearers to gather. from his words was not
made .clear, but the {Statement caused
somewhat Â¦ of a ; sensation in' the' court
room.". ' Â¦ ' ' j - 1 : - . - ,
Harris next criticized the policy of the
prosecution in. bringing to Alturas "hired
detectives and armed men".to protect wit
nesses for the : people from possible as
sault, and made the broad assertion that
the defense has" on the way to Alturas at
this time . twenty-five revolvers to be used
as protection against "those hired bulltes
and blood-hunters." 'â¢ ; .- â¢ â¢ . .. '
"It shows what extremes the : prosecu
tion-is forced to for the purpose of con
victing Jim Brown, right or wrong. You
must;not indulge hf- guessing at some
thing not in the evidence, but â¢ must with
caution examine into Â¦ the evidence until
you arrive at a moral certainty and then
act -upon 'it."' Â¦-.Â¦Â¦Â¦ t v ,: !
'.'Corruption of the worst kind," said
Harris, dramatically, "blossoms here" and
turns its face toward golden rewards that
have been /offered, like- the face of the
sunflower turning its face toward , the
sunr.no matter whose life is at stake."
. And then came the more direct attack
on the State and county officers:
"The .prosecution* has -been endeavoring
to try eighteen, men for the murder of
five men in order to get a verdict against
Jim Brown. We have - heard but little
about Martin Wilson; the burden of .their
story has been about Calvin Hall. Another
jury, will try him for the murder of Cal
vin Hall. Before it gets through perhaps
there ' will be another : court ; - another set
of ' attorneys Â¦ listening to ' these sad and
sickening tales. You cannot convict Jim
Brown on the confessions of Claude Mor
ris and John Hutton. The ' prosecution
has to hang somebody, so they picked on
Jim Brown,- and they got those two weak
minded fellows to say they helped to hang
those men at- Lookout. - Â¦â¢â¢Â¦;.â¢â¢
Blossoms of Corruption.
Harris used 'no fragile rapier on the
prosecution.' His was a broadsword and
the 'broadest of them all. B He cut, and
slashed and' dipped and 'jtore'.'at testimony
until Judge Harrington began to"fldget in
his chair and Assistant .Attorney General
Post felt an exhilaration savoring of the
trial's tempestuous early days. It was a
delectable feast â¢ of courtroom oratory,
plentifully spiced with acrimony and sea
soned with invective. The houseful of
auditors thoroughly enjoyed it.
Thrilling threat and savage sarcasm
were soothingly mingled with a variety
of. things sentimental, and just once the
Judge dipped into 'poetry. He clambereA
out.hastily,. however,* whenlthe,metaphors
began to > mix . and held himself down to
solemn prose thereafter.

Concerning the last consideration it may
be said that If the Big Basin Commission
had been contented to accept the situation
in tnis easy fashion, when a map was se
cured that had on it several tracts mere
ly marked "unknown owner," they would
already have found trouble in the control
ol the west fork of "Waddell Creek.,
Important Matter.
What Mr. Mattison appears to_ regard
of little accountâ the ownership of the
tracts in Questionâ has already been con
sidered of sufficient importance, to engage
the prompt, attention of the Governor of
California and his . associates in .the Big
Basin Commission and also Senator Per
kins and the General Land Commissioner
at Washington. >Â¦Â¦" .'Â¦
The Santa Cruz County Assessor asserts
that the lands in question are. not in the
Big Basin: Against this opinion must be
put the acts of the Big Basin Commission,
including the Governor, unless the suppo
sition is entertained that, in their capacity
of Big Basin Commissioners they are en
gaged in annexing lands that can be of no
use to the park when it is finally accepted.
Private parties, as was said in the original
story in The Call, had knowledge that the
Assessor failed officially to find out. They
were prepared to-, turn it to "private ad
vantage when the Big Basin Park Com
missioners stepped in and interfered In
behalf of the State of California.
There is no danger that the private
parties will get the public domain in the
Big Basin at present. Upon this the Stata
and the commission to be . congratu
lated. Mr. Mattison's plea that the lands
are not In the Big Basin, in view of the
attitude of the. Big Basin Commission, will
hardly be accepted to extenuate ignorance
of *he facts concerning i realty in - Santa
Cruz County, which it is his duty to know
all about for assessment purposes. :v
Counterfeiter Bair Pleads. 1
Ulysses Grant Bair, the Frultvale coun
terfeiter, was arraigned yesterday | morn-
Ins in the United States District Court
and pleaded not guilty to the indictment
charging him with making, passing and
having in possession counterfeit dollars.
Monday, March 10, was fixed as the date
for tho trial.
The exclusive story in The Call concern
ing the prompt action of the Big, Basin
Commissioners to* hold for the State lands
in the Big Basin that might otherwise find
private owners and so become a source of
embarrassment to the State In connecting
bodies of land that may " be selected . for
park purposes has caused much approval
for the Commissioners. A stir has also
been occasioned at Santa Cruz by the
publication of the facts. It I was pointed
out in The Call that had not the Commis
sioners acted at once one mile of the bed
of the indispensable west fork' of the
Waddell Cree* would : have been home
steaded by Miss McKinney, daughter of
one of the holders of timber lands In the
Big Basin. The Commissioners succeeded
in having .the Land Commissioner at
Washington hold up from location all the
Government lands in the Big Basin. Other
points of 'importance to the gtate might
easily have been lost but fo/. the zeai of
the Big Basin Commission. â¢ ,;
Boundaries in Doubt.
Some Question has been raised in Santa
Cruz as to whether the Government lands
that have been discovered by the . Big
Basin Commission are really in the Basin.
The Commissioners take the â¢ view that
they are in the Basin or on the ridges sur
rounding the Basin. No one can exactly
define the Big Basin. A topographical
map of the regipn'makes it apparent that
there are two basins rimmed in with' high
hills In the general locality. The wisdom
of >. he Commissioners in taking care ty
keep from private entry any lands that
may be needed to connect â¢ up tracts or
that are scenic points is evident in this
view, of the case. V
Assessor Frank Mattison of Santa Cruz
County has sent a, statement to The Call
in which he disputes the assertion made
in The Call that Government lands have
been assessed to unknown owners in the
office of the fianta Cruz Assessor. The
material . point in the statement of The
Call was tht.t the lands had been con
cealed from the public under the general
designation of lands held by "unknown
owners." Mr. Mattison says on this
point:
Vague Map Books.
The reason said lands are marked - "un
known owner" on maps, rather than "gov
ernment lands," is that until patent is filed
in the Recorder's office we have no means of
knowing whether any. of these lands have
been filed upon or not. Â¦ This information can
be obtained, of course, upon . request from
the land* office, but, as the lands are not as
sessable until -patented, there is no.information
except as to patent of any value to this office.
My map books are and always Â¦ have been
open to the inspection of the public and are
daily made ! use of by abstractors and others
Interested in real estate transactions, and there
is nothing more mysterious Â¦ in the manner
these lands are carried upon said books than
Is the' case with any other lands. .- â¢ â¢Â¦
In this Mr. Mattison reveals several
points. One is that the books in the office
of the County Assessor of Santa Cruz
upon which the Government lands are car
ried under the designation of "unknown
owner" are the map books and that these
are the books that the public consult for
information. The general public could
not recognize Government lands that they
could get for the homesteading under any
such designation as "unknown owner."
Another point is that he had no informa*
tlon to give about the lands, for he says
In the foregoing: "As the lands are not
assessable until patented, there is no ln-
transmission of twenty-two words In a
minute did not compare badly with ! the
work of the cables. The delects with ref
erence to secrecy had been removed.
After perfecting arrangements in Canada
he would challenge Sir William Pries and
Professor Lodge" to intercept messages.
The monopoly claimed by the Briti&h
Postal Telegraph had hitherto impeded
the establishment of a wireless service in
England and Ireland.
Marconi complained that obstructions
were thrown in his way on tiis side of
the Atlantic, in marked contrast with the
generous encouragement which he had re
ceived from the governments and press
of the United States and Canada. In re
gard to the commercial side of the sys
tem Marconi said that on the recent ar
rival of an American liner upward of 8000
words were received within sixteen hour3.
The transmission of this number; of words
daily across the Atlantic would represent
an annual income of Â£73.000 for each pair
of stations. The company, in the firs/; in
stance, was proceeding to install two
pairs of stations. Marconi will sail for
Canada next Saturday. ,.
LOXDON, Feb. 20.â At a general meet
ing of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph
Company to-day Martoni, referring to tnc
trans- Atlantic experiments, announced
that the next series of tests would in

to prevent th-i company Itoci undertaking
commercial communication with ships at

The officers on the beat said that Phll

said that two officers had been stationed

they did not see any one enter the place,
nor did-thev hear any noise.

port to -Captain Seymour conclude with
the opinion that it was an "inside Job."

SAXLOES MAY BE PUNISHED.
Sausalito came within an ace of colliding
yesterday morning,- and passengers on
both boats were subjected *, to all the
thrills of an actual collision. The Don
ahue left Tlburon at 7:50, at which hour
the Bausalito started from . Sausalito.
They reached the vicinity of thair slips
about the same time and were gliding in
Bide by side, close enough together for
conversation between their respective pas
sengers. The Sausalito was on the in
side. The boats came closer and closer
and were within a few, yards of each
other when the Sausalito turned her nose
toward the Donahue. The Donahue's tel
egraph bells jingled warnings to
th<- engine room. . The Sausalito
came , nearer and the passengers
began to take a lively Interest In
the struggle for - precedence. The Don
ahue slowed down, then stopped and only
avoided a collision by going full speed
astern. Before she began to make stern
way, however, there was the wildest ex
citement on both boats. Passengers ran
to and fro and were loud-tongued in their
denunciation of the Sausaiito's navigator.
The Sausalito held on her way, however,
: and the Donahue's passengers had time
to cool down while the captain maneu
vered abound the bay trying to regain a
position favorable for running into his
slip.

the busy Carpet people unpacking, unfolding and I
[placing on display the new Spring patterns. It's an ' |

iWhat will probably take your eye .to-day, 1
though, are the Oriental Rugs. Bale upon bale of I
these priceless gems are being dumped on the Car- 1
pet floor now, and you are bound to catch the con- 1
tagious enthusiasm of "our salespeople as each |
magnificent piece is thrown before you. J

;-â¢ During the times when , Senatorial deadlocks and
Senatorial election scandals were. prevalent in the
country it \vas said with, some show? of reason that .
tlie popular-demand for election 'of Senators by "di
rect vote of the people vvas due to the natural irrita
tion caused by such; scandals and did not represent;
the sober and matured judgment of the -people. No*
such explanation of the sentiment in favor of the â¢
amendment at this time can be made. There is ' no ;
Senatorial scandal now before the country, and yet :
SINCE the House of Representatives has for ..the'
fourth time adopted a resolution in favor, of
..i; a ; constitutional amendment providing for the
election of United States Senators by direct vote of
the people, it seems reasonable to assume it intends'
to stay with the fight until Senatorial opposition falls
and victory is won. The Senate of course has a
seemingly impregnable position/ There can be no
constitutional amendment without its consent, \xn- Â¦
i less, indeed, the. Pennsylvania plan of calling for a
constitutional convention by the States should*! b'eVcar-i
ried. That, however, is so'. improbable that virtually;
the Senate can prevent reform so long as it has the
firmness to stand fast. The only ..question /is how"
long it can remain firm in face of -: the 'increasing,
strength of the -demand for the; amendment ' Â¦
With each successive adoption of ihe resolution of
amendment the emphasis .o'fithejactipri of the House,"
has been increased.' At first* there was" much opposi-
tion to the measure, -but this time it; was adopted by.
a unanimous vote. /Perhaps some \ of .those " ' who
voted for it did so because they felt! sure it would be
defeated in the Senate, but none the less the vote at
tested'.the 'growing sentiment: amotig the people in
favor.of the change; and it may be^ that such 'senti- 1 '
ment will eventually -be. strong enough to move the
Senators themselves to yield. . . , ; /

Rev. William Rader at the Third Congre

tailor-made suit of navy. blue. cloth, with
a waist of palest blue silk. She carried a
bouauet of La-France roses and wore the
wedding gift of the groom.. a sunburst of
diamonds. ,A black picture hat with
ostrich fea-thers completed the costume.
Miss Bateman wore a handsome gown of

Mr. and Mrs. Plevin went directly Irom

their return they will occupy their new

the groom for his bride and" tHe many

much to the beauty of the place.

brating the assassin as a hero and inflating' his bloody
fancies to invest him with. the heroic quality which
those wretches ascribe to themselves.' \ "*">
No one has set up the impeccability of Presidents,
no one has assumed them to be perfect and without
frailty. For a President sinless and virgin as Mel
chizedek we must wait until we get one from Texas.
At present no one' is discussing that. - The country
wants a Federal statute of murder which will punish
the assassin of a President anywhere in the Union.
If the President be assassinated. in Michigan, Colo
rado or other State where there is no death penalty,
the Federal courts under such a statute will take
jurisdiction of the murderer and rid the earth of
him. To this it is answered that there is no death
penalty in Italy and the assassin of Humbert,' the
King, was condemned to imprisonment for. life,. as. if
he had slain Humbert the peasant. That is true, but
there is a difference between the Italian prisons and
an American . penitentiary. The slayer of Humbert
survived the rigors of his punishment less than six
months and succumbed. In Belgium there is no
death penalty. Murderers go to the galleys for life,
and five years is the extreme of their endurance.
They perish under the punishment How widely
different this from life in an American prison, with
all its opportunities for escape, with its freedom of
The various bills to effect that demand are before
the Judiciary Committee of the House, and its mi
nority has reported through Mr. Lehman of Texas.
In this report the Texan says: "I deny the proposi
tion that one honest and law-abiding man's life is
any more sacred than that of another. Any officer
of our Government is but the servant -of the people,
and 'the servant cannot be greater than his lord.'
The holding or possession of office does not of itself
render any man impeccable or immune from human
frailties and imperfections. Public men among us
can do wrong. There is no such thing as royalty or
titled nobility or hereditary prerogative in the United
States. With us there are no artificial distinctions,
and one good man is as good as another, and as
much sanctity surrounds the life of one as it does
that of another. The murder of the humblest citizen
in our land is just as heinous, just as felonious,
that of the greatest or most distinguished. Murdt?
is murder, upon whomsoever inflicted, and a human
life is a human life by whomsoever enjoyed. The
life of the highest officer in the country or of any
Embassador v of a foreign Government is no more
precious in the sight of God and republican man than
is that of the humblest and most insignificant .resi
dent of. our great republic."
There is therefore something sinister and unpleas
ant in the position taken by the minority in Con
gress. It has made a party question out of a matter
which concerns all the people, and is against legisla
tion which all demanded five months ago. 'Â¦â¢ ."'
The President was murdered not because he was
William McKinley, a citizen of Ohio, but because
he was President of the United States. In the dis
torted view of anarchy he became qualified for as
sassination by being President of the republic. Mur
der must, therefore, be counted among the risks of
the first office in the land. As a simple citizen he has
all the safeguards of, and no more, and incurs all the
vital risks and no more than any other citizen. Ele
vated to the Presidency he enters the atmosphere of
a peculiar peril, to which no other is subjected and
which no other need dread. To murder him is there
fore a peculiar, special and heinous offense against
the United States. He is a victim because he repre
sents Federal sovereignty. These things impressed
the national mind when the crime was fresh and par
ties did not divide upon them. The Democrat was
as insistent for a law in line with these principles as
FOLLOWING the assassination of President
McKinley there was a general demand for
Federal legislation to punish and suppress an
archy in this country. In several of our States capi
tal punishment is life imprisonment; no higher pen
alty can be inflicted. If a President is murdered in
such a commonwealth his assassin can suffer only
life imprisonment, a punishment recognized by the
public sense as inadequate.
i MINORITY ON ANARCHY.
Among the economic books of the day which are
engaging most attention in the kingdom; : is one
written by Mr. Byng/ a leading ; manufacturer, under
the title '-'Protection.". Among other things he says:
"My case is that of every producer in this country.
My capital and\business are imperiled, the' living of
thousands' of workmen I now employ is at. stake, and
if the safeguards' for; which I plead are denied me I
shall be compelled to? cease to be a producer. I ven
ture to prophesy that about, 1912 therejwill be no his
tory of English i'-free- --trade .to .record. - -There*"' will
eitherber.o trade ' onther e .will ' be protection."
: The argument : of Mr}. Byng" is, that a manufacturer
in a protected^ country can -manufacture more cheaply
than onein aifreeitrade country, 'and in, proof of it
he xites- the* fact that the producers of the United
States, . Germany and France are now .underselling
British products in Great Britain itself." ;VHe points
outtaat ;the*British Governmejnt^the army,' the navy,
municipal authorities and "hospitals are compelled to
purchase foreign, goods because they Â¦ are ,' cheaper,
and he^ ; asks:7 ''lA : 'British producers . cannot Â¦â¢compete Â¦
with protected \ goods' : in our own . country, how can
they; hope' t6; compete-ugainst them in colonial and
neutral i_inarkets?" - - :' â¢
-It will; be ;se'en>that these pleasare for an imposi
tion of -only \ on' foreign manufactured goods.:
Such; duties \ would help the /.British manufacturer,
but would not; benefit the farmer and : the land
owner. : We .may; be si\re, however^ ! that the adoption
of -the protective ; system for fonV 'class of industries
would be- followed by protecting: other classes.
Great Britain,. in> fact, seems to" be approaching an
abandonment of Â¦. the free : trade principle. It is a
condition; .Vnd i not .a';" theory "that 'Â¦ confronts her and
'she-must face it fairly/;?^.;.-/ 'f":';:;.; V'
It has been assumed all along ttiat -the; working
men pi -the kingdom would be resolutely opposed to
duties^ on? im'ports:>^ It appears,, however, .. they are
coming round to the/protection. side as-well as the
manufacturers: '.Thus] the . London Mail, -which has
an enormous circulation' among working classes,

was Â£93,000,000 sterling. "A tax of 10 'per cent ad

protection -sentiment among the- people. : Free, trade
isino longer -looked 'upon as a sacred dogma which

try and commerce compel a serious reconsideration
of the old problem, and out of the new- study there
is coming ;a widening conviction that not; drily Brit
ish agriculture. but^British, manufactures require pro
tection from, foreign competition;^ .
The situation confronting .the British '-.'people is
this : They ha\e a costly war on' their hands, a de
clining trade and .a fiscal system which'Sir; Robert
Giffen,.the most eminent statistician in the kingdom,
estimates I wilL result ;nv a deficit of â¢Â¦; $50,000,000 this
year. An-iincirease of revenue is imperative. Direct
taxation is about as heavy as the people^are willing
to bear. The income tax,- for example, now amounts
to as much as 30 .cents on every $5 Tof. income, and
other, taxes' 1 are in 'Â¦> proportion. -The question how
the additional revenue can be obtained is 'a .perplex
ing one, and naturally the, thoughts of the people are
turning to taxes on -imports.
If remains to~be ''seen, whether -the court j will find :
existing statutes, or prior judicial decisions, sufficient
to invalidate the New Jersey incorporation, but it is
highly, probable that resort to the principles' of the
interstate commerce act will be found sufficient for
that purpose.
In the present aspect of the case it would appear
that the able attorneys of the Northern .Securities
Company overlooked the powers of the 'Federal
Government that may be invoked ini the. premises." "
I The President has, with his usual decision, gone at
the vitals of the question. Though the contemplated
action is bfought'under the Sherman Â«anti-trust^law
of 1890, the consideration of a bill \ in . equity may
raise the whole issue of Federal power.- :; :
It will be seen that it also lights the path of liti-:
gation in this merger case. If the subject be capable
of uniform regulation, as it is obviously national in
its character, being interstate, the law of New Jersey,'
under which the Northern Securities Company is
incorporated,, cannot say "thou shalt," nor "can the
law of Minnesota say "thou shalt not," for 'the law'
of neithercan be the supreme law" of the land, and.
the power to be invoked in the premises is exclusive
of both and national in its character. The defense., of;
New Jersey against Minnesota is obviously valid..
Minnesota cannot go outside her jurisdiction to nul-.
lify a law of New Jersey. If the court follow the
doctrine, of Justice^ Field's decision Minnesota will
lose her case, but the right of New Jersey, to. protect,
her corporate creature outside her own jurisdiction
will not be -affirmed. Â¦ Â¦'- jrsÂ£- - : . - V :
In this opinion of Justice Field originated the
interstate commerce law, one of the/most useful, uni
form and necessary expansions of the law of cor
porations. ... -, . . , . : "Â¦ ; ' . ': -
. Justice. Field said: "The license tax exacted, by
the State of Missouri from dealers in goods that are
not the product or manufacture of the State before
they can be sold from place to place within the State
must be regarded as a tax upon the goods them
selves. The question presented is whether legisla
tion thus discriminating against the products of. other
States in the conditions of their sale by a certain
class of dealers is valid under the constitution of the
United States. Commerce is a term of the largest
.import; it comprehends intercourse for the purposes
of trade in all its forms, including the transportation,
purchase, sale and exchange of commodities between
the citizens of one country and the citizens and sub-,
jects of other countries and between the citizens of
different States. The power to regulate it embraces
all the instruments by which such' commerce may
be conducted. So far as, some of these instruments
are concerned, and some^ subjects which are local in
their operation, it has been heldthat the States may
provide regulations until Congress' acts in relation to
them. But where the, subject to .which that power
applies is national in its character, or of such a nature
as to admit of uniformity of regulation, the power
is exclusive of all State authority."
statute to be constitutional, and the case was taken
on a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the.
United States. '- Â¦
The State of Minnesota brought an action against
the merger, which was argued last month in the Su
preme Court in Washington. There are grave legal
doubts "of the merit of Minnesota's contention. The;
action | was brought under the statutes of that State,
and the'Suprcme Court was asked to apply that. local
law to lines, outside the State and to an incorpora
tion' effected under the statutes of New Jersey. It
may be very reasonably held*; that this is a demand
that the law of a State be judicially declared the law
or the land, contravening the provision of the Fed
eral constitution that acts of Congress ,and_. treaties
made shall be the supreme law of the land.
. There cannot be two systems of supreme law, one
originating in the Federal Government and the other |
in the States. The merged lines are located in many
States. They are common carriers engaged in inter
state commerce, and obviously in relation thereto not
subject to any State law. The issue exhibits; in' an'
interesting way the growth of corporation law in this
country. When the right of the States to regulate,
each within its own jurisdiction, the freights and
fares of railroads was. affirmed it was seen that no
State had jurisdiction beyond its own borders, and
that no number of States in combination could regu
late rates on interstate commerce.. So local rates'
within aState were long subject to regulation before
a way was found to regulate interstate charges.
The way had been pointed out in a decision o'f the
United States Supreme Court, written by Justice
Field, 'several years before the interstate commerce
law was passed. .
- A statute of Missouri declared that all persons en
gaged in selling articles of commerce produced out
side that State should: be considered peddlers, and
proceeded to fix a stiff prohibitory license on ped-~
dlers. The Missouri Supreme Court declared this
IT is . a fortunate thing for; the country : that the
, PresTdent has ordered ' the Department of 'Justice
to proceed against the Northern Securities Com
pany to test the. legality of the merger of parallel and'
competing "roads in that combination.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 20.â The House
spent the day working on the Indian ap
propriation bill. Forty-two of the sixty
two . pages were disposed of. Several
amendments were adopted, but none of
much Importance. The appropriation for
preliminary work on the reservoir for the
GHa River Valley went out on a point of
order. MEM
Smith, the Delegate from Arizona,
moved to strike out the appropriation for
the Carlisle Indian School. He declared
that experience showed those school dis
tant from the Indian reservations had
done more harm than good. The policy
was a mistaken one, In hi3 opinion. The
children were educated, made a show of
by well-disposed people, after which they
went back to the dirt and squalor In
which they had been brought up. He In
sisted that the Indian should be educated
In the environment in which he must live.
These Indian schools In the East were,
be said, the outgrowth of an Ignorant
sentlmentalism. Philosophy, mathematics
and geometry taught the Indians nothing.
They should be taught husbandry at
home. He. said the best education pos
sessed by one of the Indians on the San
Carlo reservation had been obtained by
serving four years in the penitentiary. He
had been taught discipline.
Cannon of Illinois joined with Smith in
opposing the Eastern schools. He declared
that it was the height of 'cruelty -to edu
cate the Indiana and then send them back
to savagery.
After some discussion the Smith amend
ment was lost.
Without action on the amendment tha
House, at 4:53 p. m., adjourned.
Bell of Colorado offered an amendment
to appropriate $54,000 for the Indian school
at Grand Junction, Colo. It was adopted.
Fitzgerald of New York created some
thing of a sensation by moving that no
part of the appropriation for the Indian
School at. Mount Pleasant, Mich., should
be used to pay the present superintend
ent, who. he said, had been charged with
permitting the debauchery of Indian girls.
Sherman declared that if the superin
tendent had been guilty of the practices
charged the civil service law would not
protect him, and that If - evidence were
produced to justify the charges the Com
missioner of Indian Affairs would dismiss
him Instantly. He proposed that Fitz
gerald, go with him to the Indian ouico
to-morrow and Investigate the whole mat
ter.
'If any one has been guilty of the thing3
charged," he said, "he will be out of the
service before night."

legality of Fredrick's position. The pro
ceedings will be brought in the name of
the State and will call upon both Wind
row and Fredrick to show by what war
rant or authority they pretend to act as

AMENDED COMPIiAINT FTLE7X
Planning Street Improvements.
The Board of Works decided yesterday
to meet on Mondays, commencing Feb
ruary 24, 1902, from 2 to 4 p. m., to' hear
all associations or citizens regarding the
necessity for street improvements to be
recommended to the Supervisors during
the next fiscal year. The Board of Works
yesterday awarded a contract for repay
ing O'Farrell street, between Powell and
Stockton, with- asphalt to the Alcatraz
Paving Company for $124517. Owen Mc-
Hugh received the contract to grade Six
teenth avenue, between H and I streets,
for 531S2 20. <. -
Another, conflict of authority that will
have to be determined is the execution of
judgments rendered in cases filed with
Fredrick originally and reported to his
office after the removal of Windrow. How
many of these cases there are no one
seems- to know. All that can be done Is to
await_the turning up of the papers. Win
drow deposited ,with the Treasurer some
$800 in. fees received by him. These have
not yet been apportioned, and the Treas
urer does not know what to do with
them. , The Justices of the Peace are in
a quandary, too, because . they have no
docket upon which to work except that
kept by Fredrick, and they do not seem
to care to recognize him in any way at
all. , . -
"We claim that as long as the name of the
presiding Justice of the Peace was sisned to
the papers, no matter of what nature they
might be, we had no option in the matter
save to execute them. We returned them to
the party designated by the presiding Judge of
tha Sm>erior Court to receive them and then
considered our business ended " as for as thene
cases -were concerned.
The amount involved in the suits which
the papers cover approximates $2000. Each
litigant has a chance to recover from the
Sheriff the amount of money and the fees
and other expenses attached to the litiga
tion. Then there is the question of dam
ages. This promises to be the most in
teresting portion of the impending legal
battle, for the responsibility Is divided.
The consensus of legal opinion is that the
Sheriff should have taken legal advice be
fore executing the attachments. The
Sheriff said:. .
Sheriff Lackmann deposited yesterday
and the day before with Clerk Powel
Fredrick the returns on- thirty-two at
tachments in suits bearing the signature
of Presiding- Justice Daniels and Joseph
Windrow as clerk. Fredrick declined to
receive them, and they were left on hli
desk by the deputy sheriff who made the
returns. In order that they might not be
lost Fredrick placed them in an unused
pigeonhole. He said: - f
I do not know anything about these papers.
They were dumped herÂ© by the Sheriff. I
simply picked them up and put them away so
that they could be had when wanted. The
numbers are concurrent with ours in some in
stances, but as we have no record of the- feea
being paid, or, to put it broader, no record of
any of the cases, we cannot give, them, any
consideration.
Â¦ .When ."Windrow was appointed : by ; the
Justices of the Peace after Mayor Schmitz
had removed Williams, and in addition the
latter- : had resigned, he .tiled, his official
bond and opened an office as clerk of the
Justices' Court. Fredrick, .who was ap
pointed by Mayor Schmitz to succeed Wil
liams, also had an office, and transacted
business at the old stand. "All the records
of the office were in. his possession.'
v In entering cases a consecutive number
ing system" is followed. When~Windrow
ppened . up his office he ascertained what
number . was " used "- by -Fredrick and
stamped all his papers according to, that
numerical order. Now these papers are
coming back to Fredrick arid he decline^
to receive them. In some cases there are
duplicate numbers according to Fredrick's
record, but the cases in Fredrick's office
are different from those that came from
Windrow's office, j .How many of these
cases there are no 'one as yet seems to,
know. â¢ . : .
, All sorts of legal entanglements are in
sight' for Sheriff John Lackmann, the Jus-;
tices of the Peace and. their recently de
posed clerk, Joseph Windrow. .' Some 500
or â¢ more litigants | are also concerned t in
the matter. The recent decision of Judge
Cook is responsible for this trouble."
"That's all very well," answered Parry
warmly, "but a few weeks, ago you au
thorized Commissioner Grady to buy
horses without tho'aid of McCarthy. If
Grady can do this I don't see why I can
not run the affairs of the corporation yard
without this sort of interference."
The various Commissioners protested
that they intended no slight to. Parry, but
that they merely designed to have the
business of the board transacted in a busi
ness-like manner. Parry finally with
drew his opposition to the project and the
discussion came to a close.
Antone Bacigalupi, a member of Engine
Company No. 4, who was arrested on the
Sd inst. for misdemeanor, was dismissed
from the department after a brief trial.
It was shown that his reputation was
bad, that he had been arrested In the
company of a dissolute woman and that
his record as a fireman was not of the
best. The vote for his expulsion was
unnimcus.
"He can't buy anything," said Chair
man Watt. "This board does that and
your vote Is as essential as that i of any
other member." ,
The dispute arose when the suggestion
was made by. the chairman that Secretary
McCarthy should handle the bids for sup
plies for the corporation yard and submit
them to. the board. The name of "Mc-
Carthy la distasteful to Carry and when
uttered In connection with, his own a row
may be looked for.
"I object," shouted Parry. "I am able
to look after the supplies for the cor
poration yard without McCarthy's help."
Commissioner Hecht paid there was no
disposition on the part of the board' or
McCarthy to relieve Parry of any portion
of his duty as Fire Commissioner.' He ex
plained that as McCarthy, was (he secre
tary of the board he was fully competent
to accept bids and file them - with the
board. - . â¢
The dull monotony of the meeting of the
Fire Commissioners was broken yesterday
when. Commissioner Parry voiced a loud
protest against what he termed an at
tempt to deprive him of his prerogatives
as the committee on corporation . yard.
He Insisted that If that sort of thing con
tinued he might as well step down and out
and let the corporation aftairs run them
selves. . " Â¦ :---^Â«sa^fc^^)safeÂ«stf3aÂ«er^

that he believed the Northern Securities Com
pany infringed the entl-trust law and that he
would file a bill in equity in the Supreme Court
In accordance with Instructions from the Presi
dent, to test the question, overshadowed nil
other considerations in the stock market to-day
The acute Interest manifested in thla company
by all speculators and, indeed, air holders of
securities, was vividly demonstrated by the
effect In the stock market, and was the more
notable since Great Northern preferred Is the
only stock remaining . listed on the Exchan K e
which la directly Included In the Securities
Company. Yet the whole market fell away
sharply under heavy, liquidation, with only a.
few unimportant exceptions. The stocks of th*
Transcontinental companies were naturaliv
most affected, as the formation of the .North
ernSecurltlea Company represented an ertort
to harmonize conflicting Interests In that field
Great Northern preferred lost Â«V4. Â¦ North wÂ«.l

in the lUt losses generally ran off irorn 1 o
6>.i points and over that in many exceptional
cases. On, the curb Northern Securities whTn
Issued dropped over 3 points. The direct
concern of such . a variously assorted lot of
securities In the welfare of the Northe. 11 Â¦ Se
curities Company is not very obvious but the
average speculator In stocks , and especially th>
professional trader. Is deeply imbued with -the
conviction that all his woes are the outgrowth
of the conflict for Northern Pacific control lasc
year and that it Is only necessary for the read
justment to be made of the situation ureciDl
tated at that time for the stock markef to "EL
sume all the buoyancy and speculative lurore 1
that was Interrupted by, the May, panic. For
some time there has been a deep-rooted convic
tion among the speculators/ that the Supreme'
Court would throw out- of court Minnesota's
suit against the legality, of the Northern Se
curities Company. ; There has 'been an aseumn
tlon also which was carefully fostered in the
Interest of a revival of speculation that the
public opposition to financial combinations wa<
more apparent ,: than > real . and that a demon
stration of the public utility of these combina
tions : would secure them against interference
even technically open to question as to legality
This morning's | announcement from I Washing
ton was. therefore,, a rude thock to all of these
optimistic sentiments that had - been carefully

movement swelled . the dimensions of the trad

Prices declined sharply and the market looked
seml-demorallzed. Heavy selling for European
account added to the burden of the market and
at the same time created a sharp demand for

A leading New York authority, says of the
condtlon of trade : -.; - ... - \
"A potent factor in the general business and
I financial situation, and one which must enter
Into 'calculations for. the future. Is the gradual
recovery of the; European markets from pro
longed depression. Slight recessions from high
water mark are, as I have before, noted, to be
eeen here ' and there, but the recovery of Eu
rope means increased demands for products,
of which our merchants will not be slow to
take full advantage. Slackening of demand at
home promises to be well offset by increasing
orders from abroad. The figures promulgated
by the Bureau of Statistics at Washington,
placing the wealth of the country at over eighty
Jailllons of dollars, with a relative public debt
of only one and four-tenths per cent, are such
ae to well nigh forbid pessimism. The United
Kingdom, our nearest follower, appears with an
approximate wealth of fifty-nine billions and
a relative public debt of six per cent. Such a
comparison ia not one to discourage the Ameri
can people; and In our purview of the general
situation we must not. allow the little cloudb
rr mists â often temporary setbacksâ to dim
our vision of euch powerful and fundamental
forces. Another element of encouragement In
the general situation lies In the very appre
ciable Increases during the past few months of
gold production in South Africa. The return
to anything near the normal supply would
strengthen the markets of the world and even
thÂ» present ratio of Increase ought to ease the
demands for yold upon thia country, especially
as recent events strongly indicate the llkeli
hooo of a final termination of the Boer war
within a reasonable time.

In Liverpool- the squeeze anticipated some
weeks back has come with a vengeance, and
prices have Jumjjed Is to 2s per case. The
consumptive demand from the country seems
to have exceeded even the most sanguine ex
pectations and there is no doubt that the lower
Ei.ra.tum of prices has induced a big demand.

CHICAGO. . Feb. 20.â The . wheat market
opened . with a .bearish sentiment. \ Liverpool
cables were lower. The winter crops in most
States had a- perfect covering of "snow and
more snow was predicted. May opened %@%c
to %@&c lower at 7bc to 77%c. For a time it
was thought bull markets would prevail, but
the nervousness in the New York stock market
Influenced . selling In grains and depresaed
prices. KecelDts at primary points were lib
eral and : exDort clearances were the lightest
for. some time. May sold off to-77^c and then
turned dull. There was little short interest at
the opening, but when sellers of to-day found
lower prices brought out j buyers, they began
to cover. New York late In the session re
ported fifty-one loads taken for export. This
had an Improving effect and May forsook the
bear side and sold up to 7814 c. The close was
steady, unchanged, at 7S%@78^4c. :'Â¦Â¦Â¦'â¢
Corn acted a good deal in' sympathy wl;h
wheat and almost duplicated its fluctuations.
Cables showed . a bullish Impulse, but when
wheat broke corn followed. - The general condi

close was firm, %Â®V4c higher at 61%@61%c.
Oats were dull and followed wheat and corn.
May closed Me up at 4394c. "Â¦-.<.Â¦Â¦.:
i Although the " rumor of hogs both here and
Western points was small, the market . for pro

Ing the mills. The balance of $100,000 wtl\
be held In the 'treasury. He states that the la
bor situation In the Islands Is much improved
and that everything is in good shape.
"At the moment therefore there is little rea
son for taking: a pesimUtic view of the situa
tion. The market haa had a period for rest and
recuperation; and those in control may consider
the period opportune for completing some of the
vast plans which have been under considera
tion. If they succeed In their endeavors and
nothing interferes we shall probably see & more
active market during the next few weeks, and
judicious operations to catch the fluctuations
cannot fall to prove profitable."
"Some attention has been given to the re
markable expansion of loans during the past
few weeks. As these are out of all proportion
to ordinary mercantile demands the only con
clusion is that these loans Â»nean preparations
for important financial operations of some kind.
Just what these are it Is Impossible to say.
There are abundant rumors of Important deals
in contemplation, but nothing definite has yet
been made public. No doubt much of the con
fidence Is due to inelde knowledge of what Is
going on. The outlook, however, is for easy
meney until preparations are in order for the
April settlements. Those who are financing
these deals are not likely to permit any serious
disturbance in the money market which might
Interfere.
"There is every evidence of strong Inside
eupport being riven the market and prices have
Bhown greater strength in consequence. For
â¢weeks past It has been an open secret that the
big leaders were committed to the bull side of
the market, and were simply awaiting favor
able conditions for assuming . the Initiative'.
Unquestionably the situation is more favorable
to their operations than at any time since last
cummer's ad\-ance. Since then the market has
withstood all eorts of hard knocks. The North
ern Pacific crisis, the failure of the corn crop,
the death of President McKlnley, and other
untoward events have all had their effect In
checking speculation on the Stock Exchange.
Such a. series of heavy disasters in ordinary
times would have precipitated a panic of the
sharpest character; that they did not do so Is
emphatic proof of the general soundness of the
financial situation. These difficulties have im
posed a test to the market that leaves It In
a much stronger position than would have been
the case had the rise rone on without inter
ruption. I was among those who would have
liked to have seen prices touch a lower level
in order to broaden the market and invite fresh
buying. Thle, however, it persistently refused
to do. A good deal of quiet liquidation has
taken place since last July, which has been
very painful to over-enthusiastic operators for
the rise, but leaves the situation under strong
er and better control. Weak holders have been
pretty thoroughly eliminated and the stubborn
resistance to bear attacks has completely sup
pressed all aggressiveness from that quarter.
The technical situation therefore lends ltseelf
readily to upward manipulation.

All mortgages except those 'upon the
properties of the railroad company 'are
assessed in this State for their full face
value. In" this" summary -of some ! of "the.
leading facts Â¦ concerning ' the - manner Â¦ in
which the Southern Pacific. Company has
been favored by Assessors and -the State
Boar/1 of Equalization. may ; be ', found an
object lesson of value: to taxpayers. of^all
degrees 1= thoGoJden State, t v
The mortgages of the three roads
amounted in 1500 to $148,376,220. . The
total assessment on them for purposes of
taxation, as finally agreed' upon by the
State Board of Equalization, was' $36,292,-
S85. - The difference in favor .of the owners
of. the railroads was therefore $112,083,885
in the year. . ''WtBBgV0tBBmUU^^Si
Owners Greatly Favored.
The differences here found in the totals
of the assessments and the face values
of the mortgages on the roads Just men
tioned to recapitulate, particularly for
one year, 1000, make interesting reading
and show why It jls not now necessary to
demonstrate the' differences for a long
series of years In delail. The total as
sessment against the South Pacific Coast
road for taxation In the year 1900 was
$l,O09,â¬S0. The face of the mortgage was
$5,500,000. The difference in favor of . the
railroad was $4,490,320. The total, assess
ment in 1900 against the Southern Pacific
Railroad of California for the year 1900
for taxation was $22,283,205. The face of
the mortgage was $77,803,000.
The difference in favor of the Southern
Pacific of California was therefore $55,
519,795. The total assessment of the Cen
tral Pacific road in 1900 was $13,000,000. The
mileage was 1362.91 In total; including the
parts of the road lying outside of Califor
nia- The total mortgage on the system
was $120,622,086 70.-. The mileage of the
Central Pacific. In California was 746.75
miles. The mortgage on the portion of
the road in California amounted to $88,570
per mile In common with the' entire Cen
tra' Pacific line. On the total mileage Jn
California the "mortgage must have been,
therefore, at least $65,073,220. This result
is. obtained by nrst - dividing the -. total
mortgage by the number of totar mlle3
and then multiplying the average rate of
mortgage per mile so revealed by the total
mileage exclusively In California.
â¢ The favor granted to J the Central Pa
cific road In the year 1900 as between the
face of the mortgage and the total of the
assessment was $52,073,220.-
Difference in Totals.
The Southern Pacific of California was
assessed in 1880 at $14,733 15 per mile In
1884 and 1S85 the rate exceeded $17,000 per
mile. In the year 1900 the assessment had
fallen to $10,500 per mile. The total assess
ment In 1300 amounted to $22,283,205. This
amount was $8,000,000, in round figures
greater than the. total assessment of 1883.'
But in the period intervening between
1S88 and 1900 the mortgage upon the lines
of the Southern Pacific Railroad of Call
fornla increased from $32,431,500 to $77 803 -
500. The increase on the face of the
mortgage was in excess of $44,000,000, as
against the increase in the assessment of
$S,000 ,000, showing a favor to the railroad
company In the laying of assessment
amounting to $36,000,000 net for that one
year.
The California Pacific was assessed at
the rate of $16,000 per mile in 1SS0 and the
rate fluctuated, reaching as much as
$22,000 per mile in 1S91 and $20,000 per mile
before it was fused with the Southern
Paciric of California. Since then' the rate
has been brought down, in common with
â¢all the lines included by consolidation
with the Southern Pacific Railroad ot
California to $10,500, which is the rate
now. In other words the Equalizers have
treated this line as they did the -Central
Pacific and have more than cut the as
sessment in two by gradual reduction.
The rate of assessment on the South
Pacific Coast Road was as high as
$15,834 per mile in 1832. It has since been
reduced to $10,500. In the meantime the
mortgage on its short mileage has re
mained stationary at $5,500,000 since 188b.
The mileage being less than one hundred
the mortgage is at the rate of more than
$55,000 per mile, or five times the figures
that the road is assessed at per mile for
purposes of taxation.
Assessments Fluctuated.

Balducci of San Francisco, was recovered
from the bay this afternoon at 4 o'clock

the remains were found a San Francisco

from Leon Andre, employment agent, 316

some odds and ends in the clothing were
a number of medical prescriptions t and a

in the matter. He said it was usual in

) THE SUICIDE'S REASON
During Attorney Reed's absence he will
visit Providence. R. I., where some of
the Cogswell interests lie. an-i also "Wash
ington, New York and Chicago.
By Mrs. Cogswell's will $80,000 was de
vised to various friends and relatives and
the following persons receive the remain
der: Harry D.- Skellinger, Mrs. Robley,
MlS3 Robley and Miss Richardson,
nephew, sister and ' nieces respectively.
Alexander O. Richards of San Francisco,
a nephew of Mrs. Cogswell, who was de
vised $1000, has threatened to contest her
will.. .
The Cogswell fortune at the time of
Dr. Cogswell's death was estimated to
be . worth $500,000. Of this amount the
only realty, in the estate Is a gore piece
10x12 feet at the junction of Kearny
street and Montgomery avenue, San Fran
cisco, in front of which is the Benjamin
Franklin fountain, the first of a number
which the whimsical doctor presented to
San Francisco. Fully $200,000 of the es
tate is In gold coin, and this does not
include the $100,000 or more which Is UÂ»
object of Executor Henshaw's search.
Prior to Mrs. Cogswell's death she had
distributed to herself $200,000 of her hus
band's estate. There is as much more, it
13 estimated, to go to her in case the-con
test of several nieces and a half-brother
against the will is decided in favor of the
estate. Added, to Mrs. Cogswell's portion
must, be the* Eastern savings.
That this treasure should have been un
covered is only another evidence of tha
remarkable frugality of the now deceased
couple, and likewise is it another evi
dence of the careful manner in which tha
Cogswells maintained their estate. Not
in speculation in stocks nor in attempts
to increase their fortune by real estate

of the wills of the late Henry D. Cogs
well, the eccentric pioneer philanthropist,
of San Francisco, and his wife, Mrs;

; ALAMEDA, Feb.. 20.â Henry Kunz of
1720 San Antonla avenue was shot at by
a" burglar in front of, his own home last
evening. ; Kunz narrowly escaped death,
and the burglar had an equally narrow
escape, from capture. Kunz owes his life
to the fact that the burglar .was as much
dazed as he and his aim was fmpaired, for
the bullet whistled. close to his head, and
the burglar made his escape in the dark
ness.
: Kunz, who is a liquor merchant, doing
business in San Francisco, returned home
about 7:30 o'clock. Hiss family were away
visiting friends. When Kunz reached the
frontvdoorof his residence he found it un
locked, but chained on the inside,
rattled the. door vigorously, expecting to
arouse some one whom he thought might
be within. Suddenly there was a crash
through a side window, a shower of glass
fragments followed, a man struck the
ground and for a brief time'lay prostrate.
Kunz ran toward him. With an oath the
man sprang up and yelled to Kunz to
"keep hanas off."- â¢ Uttering another im
precation he shot at the astonished Kunz
as he . rushed by him, and ran along San
Antonio avenue toward Union street.
Kunz then entered his house and notified
the police by telephone. All efforts to se
cure a trace' of the crook who would not
hesitate to do murder proved futile, and
it is thought he got safely out of the city
last night. : .Â¦ ' .
An examination the interior of the
Kunz residence showed , ; that the looter
had -just begun operations. One 1 room had
been , ransacKed , but the burglar discov
ered nothing:there that "strucK- his fancy.
On - the floor j of the room; was found a

The reports of the Equalizers show that
the Central Pacific road was assessed at
at rate of $20,264 per mile in 1S80, but the
assessment was changed from year to
year between 1S80 and 1885. The highest
assessment was 538.312 per mile in 18S4.
There was a drop in 18S5 and again in
1SSS. In 1S89 the rate of assessment per
mile was $17,408 53. and there the rate has
remained ever Eince, not much more than
one-half what it was in 18S4 and 16S3. the.
rate of assessment per mile in the last
mentioned year. 18S5, being $34,238 5L In
this period the bonded debt or mortgage
on the Central Pacific road has grown
from $58,880,000 in 1SS8 to $118,153,458 49 in
1900. The assessment for taxation in this
State, of course, was only upon the mile,
age in thio State, which is 747 miles, ap
proximately, as officially reported. ThÂ»
total mileage of the Central Pacific, in
cluding Nevada, was 1362.91 in the year
1900, so that over one-half of the total
mileage is in California. As the earning
capacity of the road in California is su
perior to that of Nevada per mile, at least
one-half of the augmented mortgage of
At times during the last fifteen .years
the number of companies operated by the
same owners was greater than It is now,
and, therefore, several appear in reports
that will not be reported hereafter to the
State Equalizers. But the properties are
the same lines, subjected only to con
solidation.
In other particulars, it might as well
be said here, the figures are derived from
reports filed before the State Board of
Railroad Commissioners under oath by
the officials of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. The parties in the railroad interest
have therefore furnished the facts, in
their two capacities of makers of high
rates for transportation and low rates for
purposes of taxation, upon which all
statements Included in this article are
based. If they are in error the railroad
people and the State Board of Equalizers
have no just reason for complaint.
Figures From Reports.
Before entering into more detailed state
ments attention will be called to a few
significant facts concerning the decrease
in the rate of assessment for taxation per
mile of railroads which the State Board
of Equalizers has seen fit to make In the
period of fifteen years. It is in the knowl
edge of every one that the earning ca
pacity of the roads has not diminished
in that period, but has greatly increased.
The bonded debt or mortgage per mile has
also greatly increased. The figures that
are presented are taken from the annual
reports of the State Board of Equaliza
tion in some particulars and eo probably
will not be disputed.
This takes in only one line and that for
enly a little less than one-half of the
period of fifteen years. It. does not in
clude tiie enormous taoc dodging . on ac
count of the Central Pacific road, the
South Pacific Coast line, the Oregon and
California in California nor of the other
properties which have appeared under
various names, but all under the same
ownership during a series of years, while
awaiting the consolidation to which they
may have been subjected.
It must be premised here, for the sake
of a clear understanding, and to prevent
the railroad from successfully casting
dust in the eyes of the honest taxpayers
of the State, % that the mortgage debt that
is referred to in this article represents
only the bonds actually outstanaing and
bearing interest at the several dates men
tioned. The roads have been actually
earning and paying interest on the entire
bonded debts of which totals are given,
so that the property has had actual exist
ence. The stock issues, amounting to a
vast sum collectively, are entirely ignored
in this article.
Central Pacific Excluded.
The property of the Southern Pacific
Railroad of California, which carried a
bonded indebtedness of $32,431,500 in 1SSS,
was assessed by the State Board of
Equalisation in thai year for only. $14,000,
000, not one-half of the mortgage. In liWtt
the bonded debt or mortgage of the
Southern facinc Railroad of California
haa risen from $32,4ol,5yu, the figures for
tne Just mentioned year, to $77,So3,5uO. The
total assessment by the State Board of
Equalizers in unri on that road was $22,
iii,2u5. cr Jo5,52u,;.'y5 less than the actual
mortgage for on* road ior one year. In a
period of seven years the differences be
tween the iac-e or the mortgages of the
Southern Paciric Railroad of California
in these several years and the total of the
assessments cf tne State Board of Equali
zation was $21Â»,b36,3Â£l.
In a period of fifteen y'ears, it has been
ascertained by The Call after a labori
ous search for facts, the Southern Pacific
Company has succeeded in having its
assessments by the State Board of Equali
zation amount to hundreds of millions of
dollars less , than the bare face of the
mortgages upon its several roads In Cali
f orina. The year 1900 alone shows that the
Southern. Pacific Company's property was
favored in this way to the amount of $112.-
OS3.SS5. Very likely the difference in favor
of the railroad people since the opening of
the Central Pacific road would amount to
one billion, dollars, taking all the lines
that have been the property of the South
ern Pacific Company in the long period
since the '6D's. It is not essential to pres
ent purposes to verify that the amount of
tax dodging In this way represents a bil
lion dollars. .The object lesson presented
to the taxpayers of the State and to the
State Board of Equalization this morning
is sufficiently impressive without any ad
ditional- facts.

Resolutions of Sympathy.
Father Peter C. Yorke paid his caustic
respects to the British for continuing
what he called their unrighteous warfare.
He declared that the sentiment of patriot
ism among the Boers was too deeply
rooted ever to reconcile itself to defeat.
It was better to die as freemen than .-to
live as slaves. Great Britain was declared
to be the robber nation of the world, cov
eting the possession of the earth in vio
lation of tne moral law, a blood-drenched
power, eager to - extend Its dominion
throughout the ends of the earth, over the
corpses of countless men and by the ex
penditure of millions of : money wrung
from the people themselves. .: It was . the
lust for gold which prompted â¢ this nation
of shopkeepers to otfer up hecatombs of
victims in order that they might possess
themselves of the Transvaal, which pos
sessed the fatal gift of wealth. The Eng-.
lish were designated as a race of hypo
crites, as people who went everywhere as
British subjects and declined to change
their citizenship, although they did not
disdain to run the countries in which they
found refuge. The' leaders in. the present
war were discussed by the speaker, and
the acts of the British soldiery in South
Africa were paraded in scorching sen
tences. Humanity demanded a cessation
of. this unnatrual struggle, which had
wrecked a hundred thousand homes and
broken the hearts of countless wives and
mothers. It was the duty of the American
people, 1 instead of making treaties . with
this bloody-handed . nation, to rise -up in
their might and shout in stentorian tones
that England shall cease her Iniquity and
the Transvaal shall be free. , -
British, Severely Censured.
The struggle of the Boers for freedom
found its analogy, according to . the
speaker, in Washington's superb maneu
vers in the face of overwhelming British
odds. They were determined to continue
the tight until victory was won or the last
Boer man. woman and child was buried
under the sod. The address was frequentr
ly interrupted by vociferous applause, f
.. A patriotic poem eulogistic or- the Boers,
written by Theodore Plnther, was recited
by. Miss M. Butler of Oakland. This was
followed by a" collection taken up by an
array of young women, aft<er a strong plea
for funds by.-, the Mayor. A:, large, sum
was collected. Â¦ Â¦Â¦ '. > Â¦:
The speaker then outlined the causes
which led to the Boer war and his ref
erences to Chamberlain, Rhodes and other
Englishmen prominent in South African
affairs were greeted with hisses. He re
counted his own experiences as soldier
and otiiqer and described with some hu
mor the affair eighteen miles from Bloem
fontein, when General Gatacre .with 7U00
men. was defeated by. General. Dewet
with less than 500 burghers. The predic
tion was made that the Boers womd con
tinue the war as long as England found
money to pay the expenses. .
Commandant W. D. Snyman of the Boer
army was presented by the Mayor amid
tremendous applause. He said it did his
heart good to see such sympathetic facea
about him and he regretted that there
was not a convenient bird somewhere, to
carry the news to his countrymen in the
Transvaal that San Francisco was with
them heart and soul.
' The platform was crowded with mem :
bers of the league and many citizens and
prelates. Mayor Schmitz was introduced
as the chairman of the eveningâ an honor
he accepted in a brief expression of his
sympathy for the Boer cause. His re
marks were greeted. with cheers. ' Â¦
The, mass meeting held under- the au
spices of the Transvaal League to ex
press sympathy for the Boers in their
struggle for independence filled all avail
able seating space in the auditorium of
Metropolitan Temple - last night. An in
teresting programme was Â¦ rendered, and
the enthusiasm, with which the various
speakers were greeted indicated that the
sympathy of the: vast majority of those
present was for Oom Paul Kruger and his
storm- tossed people.
"There has been too much familiarity
between the members of .the department
and Dr. Bazet to suit me. I intend that in
the future Dr. Bazet shall not treat any
officer or any member of his family ex
cept that he is officially told to^do so. It
has been a common practice for policemen
to send for Dr. Bazet. presumably in the
hope of gaining his friendship. Then
when the officer is subjected to a physical
examination Â» he. of course, expects that
the Police Surgeon will give the best of it
I don't propose that the men in the de
partment shall be on such friendly terms
with the surgeon. If an officer is really
sick Dr. Bazet will be sent to his home to
treat him. When one of his family is
taken ill, however, I do not intend that
Dr. Bazet shall be called in. By this
means I hope to stop any familiarity be
tween the Police Surgeon and the mem
bers of the force."
Hereafter Dr. Bazet, the Police Surgeon,
will not attend to the Ills of the members
of the Police Department or their rela
tives unless he is ordered to do so by
Chief Wittman. Last evening the head of
the department issued ah order which was
read to the watch, notifying, the' patrol
men that in case of sickness among them
selves or their families under no consid
eration must they summon Dr. Bazet.
Many of the officers were* considerably
surprised after the order had been read,
as they looked upon the medical gentle
man as one of them.*
In explanation of the order Chief Witt
man said:

Indirectly Caused tha Death of
the World's Greatest General.
It is a matter of history that Napoleon was
a gourmand, an Inordinate lover of the good
things of the table, and history further records Â¦
that his favorite dish was fried onions; his
death from cancer of stomach, it is claimed
also, was probably caused from his excessive
indulgence of this fondness for the odorous
vegetable. Â¦
The onion is undoubtedly a wholesome article
of food. In fact has many medicinal qualities of
value,' but it would be difficult to find a more
Indigestible article than fried onions, and v
many people they are simply Â¦ poison, but ! the
onion does not rtand alone In this respect. Any
article of food that Is not thoroughly digested
becomes . a source I of disease and - discomfort,
whether it be fried onions Â»3r beefsteak.
The. reason why any wholesome food Is not
promptly digested is because the stomach lacks"
some Important - element of Â¦ digestion. . Some
stomachs lack peptone, others are deficient in
gastric Juice, still others lack hydrochloric acid.
The one thing necessary to do in any case of
poor digestion is to supply, those elements of
digestion which the stomach lacks, and nothing
does this so thoroughly and safely as Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
Dr. Blchardson, in writing a thesis on treat-
ment of dyspepsia and Indigestion, closes his
remarks by saying: VFor those suffering from
acid dyspepsia, shown by sour, watery risings,
or for flatulent dyspepsia, shown by gas on the
stomach, causing- heart trouble -and difficult
breathing, as well as for - all other forms ot
stomach - trouble, the â¢ safest treatment Is to
take one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablet 3
after each meal. I advise them- because they
contain no harmful drugs, but are composed
of valuable digestives, which act promptly upon
the food eaten. I never knew a case of Indi-
gestion Â¦ or even â¢ chronic dyspepiia which
Stuart's Tablets 'would not reach."
Cheap cathartic medicines claiming to cure
dyspepsia and Indigestion, can have no effect
whatever in actively digesting the food, and
to. call any cathartic medicine & cure for Indi-
gestion Is a misnomer. - "
Every druggist . In the United States and
Canada sells Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, and
they are not only the safest and most sue- <
cessful. but the most scientific of any treatment
for Indigestion and stomach . troubles. -

Continuing the general discussion of
conditions in the Philippines he expressed
the opinion that the trade with the United
States will ultimately increase and the
islands will be self-supporting, even to
the extent of paying the expenses of the
United States army there. : i
"Do you believe that what we are iiow
doing in the Philippines is best for the
Filipinos and for the people of the United
States as well?", asked Senator Allison.
"I do," said Governor Taft; "We are
pursuing there the only course onen to
us, and it was absolutely impossible for
us to pursue any other course than the
one we did pursue and are pursuing there.
If the Senators on the side of the table
(referring to the Democratic members ot
the committee) had been there they could
not have done differently, and when their
party comes into power, if It should do so
they cannot do anything: but go ahead."
Senator Culbersonâ If^a safe and hon
orable Â¦ opening for withdrawing : from I the
islands should present itself do you think
the United States should avail itself of it?
-Governor Taftâ That question assumed
that there "might, be such an opening. I
don't -think there will be and I say no
Possessed,, as I believe that I am. with
the missionary epirit, I think that we
should continue our work In those islands
now that we axe there and there Is no
likelihood of finding honorable ways out
Governor Taft was excused at the con
clusion of 'the' sitting and the .committee
adjourned until next Tuesday, with the
understanding that General Hughes will
be the next witness.
Replying to a series of questions Gover
nor Taft said the intervention of the
United States in the Philippines was the
best thing that could happen for the Fil
ipinos, but that it would have been better
tor our country if we had not gone there.
He added: "If the result in the end
proves, to be in the Interest of the gen
eral welfare then we, can possibly Justify
ourselves . on the ground that we have
taken only our share of the burden of
civilization in bringing out an uncivilized
people." . ' . .
Be Carried Out.
WASHINGTON, ..Feb. 20.â Governor
Taft discussed climatic conditions in . the
Philippines to-day before the Senate Phil
ippine Committee., Governor Taft -said
that much of the sickness \ among: the
American. troops Is due to exposure and
he incidentally made an appeal for liberal
appropriations for the construction ol
barracks and for the protection of' officers
and men. â¢
Taft Says the. Philippine Policy Must
AMERICA CANNOT WITHDRAW
â¢ Nelson ot Minnesota and McCumber of
North Dakota supported the admlnistra*
tion's policy in the islands.
â¢Â¦.He asserted that if the 6,00o,000 of Chris
tians in the Philippines were Protestant
Christians the cruelties practiced on them
by; the American authorities would have
to stop, as no member of Congress would
be able to withstand j the wrath of the
Methodists, Baptists and Presbyterians ot
this country. . .
WASHINGTON, ; Feb. 20.â With the ex
ception of a few minutes given to routine
business the / Senate to-day- devoted its
entire open session to the Philippine ques
tion. 1 Patterson of Colorado, one 1 of tha
minority members of the Philippine Coin-'
mittee, delivered h!s first extended speech
in the Senate and ; was tiven a most at*
tentlve hearing:. He discussed principally
the sedition laws enacted by the Philip*
pine Commission, vigorously attacking the
authority of the commission to enact and
enforce : such laws. â¢ He maintained tha't
Congress alone had the power to put in
force enactments of that character. . He
compared intormation furnished by the
executive departments of the Government
with some of the statements of Governor
Taft. in his testimony before the Philip
pine Committee, with respect to the capa
bilities of the Mlipinos and declared- with
some heat his belief that Governor Taft
misrepresented the true situation in the
islands for motives unknown. - " -~
Alludes to; the Fact ,That- the
Six Million Christians Are .

Object to Firemen Painting.
The Supervisors* Fire Committee yes
terday considered the protest of the mem
bers of .the District Council of Palnterjs
against painting by members of the Fira
Department. Joseph TuKe, president of
the Painters' Union, held that the spirit
or the charter is violated when firemen
engage in painting. Fire Commissioners
Watt and Hecht stated the work was done
by the firemen at their own instance and
consisted of painting their own quarter^
There was not money enough in the fund"
though the Commissioners believed the
wflrk should be done by the Board at
Works. The committee urged the com
mission to comply with the charter in tha
matter of repairs.

of beating- him. and when they told him
that they had, refused- to allow Valenso

The four of usâ the , Lundbofes v were
aloneâ stopped at the Cliff House ;that day
and had luncheon." . : . -â¢ . -'-â¢-.
"Did you have drinks?" : -'â¢ â¢â¢Â» â¢
"Yes. We always had. our rounds."
"Did Miss de Brettevllle always drink?"..
"I never saw â¢ her â¢ refuse." ... ''Â¦'Â¦
And so It went along, this succession of
drives and drinks and luncheon*,: theater,
seats and opera boxes and bills to pay at
the Jeweler'sâ at' least, according to the
story of the defendant. ' Â¦ -
Anderson eald he bought.- the ! plaintiff
the maraulse riny because -she- 'said she
had seen such beau tifuli rings at Colonel
Andrews' diamond palace and* she- grave
him no peace till he bought her one. "When
he gave it to her.she.putlt on. her, finger,
and holding it up to the light In' a trans
port of Joy, Bald: t : , . i- Â¦Â¦Â¦>: \
"Ain't it grand?"
"It ousrht to be, it cost enougrh," was
Anderson's. reply. *__/;â¢ .:,.â¢Â¦ .Â¦'.... .:
Wanted'' an Opera I Cloak.' -
Anderson claims he" bought the^second
ring, eet with , pearl and i diamonds, be
cause 6he begged -for it; "also" the furs.
She wanted an opera cloak and he finally
gave her $60 to get one and she got a. dress
instead. ... ... L. ..... _. .... ... .
"You see, I am this way, " Anderson
said In ' explanation; "if ' any body wants
anything and I can get-.lt,,ltls veryhard
for me to say- no. 'Â¦Â¦ .That's ' the way . I've
lost lots of money." . ,:::;' - ; ..v
Anderson admitted : that â¢ when â¢ he dldn' t
buy Miss de Bretteville what I she wanted
"she got' kind of â¢ cold Â¦ and. chilly -and
pouty, as'a.woman will do -sometimes."
Anderson knows 1 the 'ways of: women. He
doesn't look wicked, but -he confessed |to
Miss de Brettevllle's tall- brother and stern
father that'he was wicked and- sinful, 'not
half good enough for -Alma, so they tes
tified. -â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦ . .--. .;Â¦-;â¢> -J Â¦Â¦-Â¦ ... .: : :
Miss dÂ© Brettevllle : wanted to go to
grand opera and Anderson paid $60 for a
box and took the family. ". The names were
all in the . papers Â¦ next" day.- ., '>-.... ;
"Did you ever give her; money?" coun
sel asked.- â¢:"â¢-Â¦ - â¢â¢Â¦.-'Â« V - ' ; ' r.~-' 'Â¦Â¦"Â¦ .; . h- Â¦ - !
"Sometimes when I would see her down-,
town at luncheon she would say she had
forgotten her purse | and had no â¢ car fare."
I never like to be small about such: things
and I would" throw' her'a. twenty or two,";
tne witness replied. Â¦'Â¦Â¦'.-',â¢. .- ,- -.- Â¦-'Â¦'.
Anderson evidently, began ? early in : the
romance to look "on It with suspicion, i He
thinks that when he found the ring In hla
piece of cake 1 at* the* Sonoma wedding he
was the victim <of?a sort of shell' game;
that by some hocus-pocus the' ring. was
shot into his bit of cake. :' The minister,
who was a humorous- personage,'- said:
"Mr. Anderson, I -think- I- see in
your plate," and 1 sure enough -there; was
the ring. ' Â¦ He â¢: denies f that ;. ne : then and
there admitted- the engagement and 4 says
