Mr. Colnon was always a strong par

Democrats in many a political ' campaign.
His edltoHal offense and- defense, were
especially strong.'- Not until the year 1894.
however, .did' he -ever accept substantial
reward for his services. Then James H.
Budd, his friend for many years, who had
just taken his seat as Governor, offered
him the. position as his secretary, which
Mr.- Colnon accepted. -."This, position:-, he
filled: for. about a year, -when. he resigned
to become President of the StateBoard of
Harbor Commissioners; his appointment
dating from March 28, 1S95. ,
This appointment met general approval'.
Mr.'Colnon fulfilled the duties of the office
during his term of four years with much
satisfaction to"' the â¢ transportation and
shipping interests of : this port and the
public generally. v Under his administra
tion many changes were made, to the bet
terment \ of - the : service, and" many im
provements were instituted. -.'The new fer
ry building was started and nearly com

a He remained in Nevada for a number of
yearsr bpt finally returned | to California,
and in, 1879 settled in Stockton, .where,
with "James, Nunan, he founded the Stock
ton Evening Mail,;, which soon became one
of the leading interior papers of the State.
This . enterprise proved > a remunerative
one to Mr. Colnon and his partners, and
during the years oChis connection with it,
which lasted until his death, : it made, for
him a 'fair fortune. .. â¢ .- - .
made one of the foremost interior, papers

as Secretary, to the Governor and Presi

acquaintances.,. Both' within and without
the ranks of ; the Democratic party, ;to
which he belonged, his friend? were num
bered by the thousands, and were to be
found in every, township in the State. -
Edward L. Colnon's first occupation was
that of a- painter, 'which-: he began on
leaving.. school, and. before he was 17- years
of age. While yet In his teens, he went
over into Nevada, whither. many, people
were, then being drawn by the new discov

1. One of the chief reasons for the rup
j ture with the Northwestern, according to
' a high Union Pacific official, is that there
â¢ have been disagreements as to the han
dling of freight, and traffic difficulties of
one kind and another are constantly aris
ing. When the Union Pacific was con
trolled by the Vanderbilt interests there
was no difficulty in maintaining agree
ments, but since the Union Pacific has
passed into Harriman's control it has be
come evident that close relations with the
Illinois Central, which Is also a Harriman
line, would be more easily maintained.
This movement was frequently^ -talked
of at the time the Illinois Central first
built into Omaha, but as time . has * gone
by without any action being taken, ihe
railroad men had come to believe that the
rumor was mere idle . talk. Now, : unlesÂ»
present plans miscarry, there is said.tci
be no doubt but that the new arrangement
will come Into effect as soon as the neces
sary construction and other preliminaries
csm be completed, which' will â¢ be within
the next two years. :,...'-*.;.
"When the extension from Fort Dodge,
la., to this city was built, three years ago,
the roadbed and bridges were, made to al
low the laying of a second track at any
time, so that the work, will not be diffi
cult.
OMAHA, Feb. 25.â Plans are now under
v.ay which will result in the substitution
of the Illinois Central for the Northwest

was done, - and when the grip was opened
the nurse noticed that it was empty; at
least," there was nothing that : she saw.
After seating himself in the chair with his
satchel Mr. Colnon picked up a glass from
a small table standing near his chair, and,
handing; it to the nurse, said that ' ho

her - to - go : to - the refrigerator : outside and

noticed a marked improvement in the sick
man's condition and an attempt was made
to -cheer the patient by holding out some

Last evening at 7 o'clock Mr. ; Colnon
was visited 'by the physician, at which
time his spirits were improved, and he
was doing as well as could be expected.

Colnon arrived that he had been very sick
with . Bright's disease * and that .since
Christmas he had been confined to hi3
room. His- 'condition was regarded from

WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.-Spencer Eddy,
Secretary of the American Legation at
Corretantinople, who conducted most of
the negotiations looking to the release of
Miss Stone, arrived in Washington to-day
for the purpose . of conferring with the
State Department in regard to the case.
"There Is not a great deal to be said
about the case of Miss Stone," he said.
"The latest news of her release Is official.
She is certainly free. The important
facts to be ascertained before further ac
tion is taken by this Government aro
whether her captors were Bulgarians or
Turks, and upon what ground she was
captured. These facts will be . definitely
known when she herself reports : to the
State Department on the matter, which
she will do. If it is found that the Turk
ish Government is * responsible I do not
think it will be extremely, difficult to col
lect an Indemnity. The money for her re
lease was paid on Bulgarian, soil,. but she
was released in Turkey. She was not ill
treated by the brigands. I was- surprised
at the furor created, in this country by
the news of Miss Stone's capture."
"Miss Stone's horse ,t ell. and as she was
blindfolded she was unable to save her
self. Fortunately "she escaped with only
a badly bruised knee. With this excep
tion Miss Stone and Mme., Tsllka are in
splendid health. 'They have been at work
all day making dresses for- themselves
and the baby. â¢_Â¦ When found they wero
clad in a native costume of red and a
white shepherd's cloak. .The baby is -a
fine healthy girl, seven â¢ weeks old. .We
all leave here to-morrow for Salonica." â¢
"Mits Stone and Mme. Tsllka greeted
the ran scrriers with some emotion, and
after mutual congratulations Mm*-.
Tellka's baby was â¢ brought in. During
the last two weeks, the ladles have been
traveling over the mountains. In the day
time they were hidden and at, night were
hurried on blindfolded on " horsebuck. .
"I left Salonica this morning with tnÂ«

at Constantinople and % Dr. .House, the
treasurer of .the American . mission . in
Turkey. The Turkish authorities refused
permission to" Mme.. Tsllka's husband to

One of the most disastrous, collapses of
the day occurred .on San ". Jose - avenue,"
near Twenty-fourth .street, when a three
story flat in course of erection. was car
ried from its foundation and . totally
wrecked. The. demolished building looked
like the remnants of a wrecked .vessel
lying in a heap, upon the shore.'
The house : was- being erected by; the
owner, H. Feige, of 1068 Capp street. The
best of material was used In the construc
tion, but agreat error was made in not
guarding against possible, gales, which
may at any time; burst forth with fury at
thi3 season of the year./ The windows in
the fropfpart of the House had not' been !
put in, though the back: end was. closed.
The consequence, was that the winds blew
in from the front, and .finding no outlet,
lilted- the structure^from the foundation.

was preparing to go to the roof when: he

wood work; -but not with sufficient
force to push the cable car> off

â¢ that was. struck. On the opposite side of
Â¦the dummy was an elderly lady, who
; jumped off. - She fell, but was not injured.
The damaged â¢ car was shoved down the
track and obstructed traffic on the Jack

A TERRIFIC gale swept over this
city" yesterday morning. With
savage velocity the wind whis
tled through the streets and
around the tops of the high
buildings, striking terror to the
. hearts of the timid and causing
material damage' in nearly, every section
of the town. It commenced to blow about
1:30 a. m. and steadily Increased in force
until about 10:30, when it was blowing a
southeast gale and had attained a veloc
ity of forty-eight miles an hour. Several
houses ' in the outlying sections were
blown down, trees were uprooted and
twisted as If they were mere stems in
the grasp of a giant, ' skylights and tin
roofs were torn from their fastenings and
hurled Into the streets or on the tops of
neighboring buildings, telegraph wires
and poles were blown' down, window
panes were broken and for a. time traffic
was almost isuspendei. .
In the harbor the craft lying at anchor
cr tied up to the docks dragged their
anchors or broke loose from their moor
ings and bumped into each other. One
vessel came- dangerously near being
pounded to pieces on the rugged rocks on
Alcatcaz. Bay traffic was entirely sus
pended during the height of the gale and
Â¦was not resumed until 2 o'clock in the
afternoon, when the storm subsided. The>
steamer James M. Donahue had two nar
row escapes and came out of the last one
Â¦with a broken rudder, which will lay her
up for some time.
Souses Are Blown Down.
Two Italian fishermen had narrow es
capes from drowning during the gale.
Their fishing boat capsized .off Alcatraz
and were it not for the timely assistance
of Harry Jchnson, captain â¢ of one ot
Henry Peterson's launches, the gale
would have claimed at least "two victims.
The French bark Max came near caus
ing another wreck. She broke lodse from
her mooring at the Fulton. Iron Works
and drifting into the stream collided with
the steamer Premiss, causing consider
able damage to the Matter's bow. Several
other bay disasters were narrov. r iy avert
ed, and had it not been for the fact that
the shipping interests had been given
timely warning of â¢ the approach Â¦ of the
gale terrible calamities might have oc
curred.
In the Mission two three-story houses
in the course of construction wer^ lev
eled by the storm. The terrific wind laid
hold of the roofs of both buildings with
savage force and hurled them j Into the
street. The mighty /rale then sn-cpt
apainst the sides of the builc2:r<2:s and
they crumpled and collapsed as if they.
were mimic structures ' of toy bkclis.'
Luckily nobody -was injured.
The first buildlr.g. to cnliapse in "the
teeth of the piping southeaster was
a three-story frame building which
Â¦was being ' built on Ran Jose
avenue r.ear Twenty-fourth street.
Contractor and Br'.ldcr Kerr.v Fe'g
owned it. Shortly J:ercro 10 <vt!jck yes
terday morning -FVig: noticed that th<?
wind was attasi.insr sreai velocity, ana as
the building: was in a rp-n that vrasf al
most absolutely unprotected from the
storm he ordered his men to quit r. - ork.
About half an hour later the. wind at
tained its highest velocity and Kcigr's
'care Tvere realized. Â¦.,'Â¦Â¦' -j â _
; Citi3:n? Skerry to Sh?lter."
Down came the roof of. the buiMlng.
The timber* and metal iwisted and
jammed tccether 1n a. , chaotic mass
in the middle of â¢ the street- The
wind eocn completed . its work' of
destruction. The sides of the build
ing collapsed, and the pedestrians
who braved the j-torm Kn wi*nef-3 the ler
rible- wrath of the elements had la sfcurtT
to shelter to dod^e the nylns' shingles
and heavy .splinters that were whirled
around in the eddying gusts. The dam
age is estimated at $Â£00. .
The next building to suecurab to the
desolating fury of tho storm was an
other Ihrec-story structure in the course,
of erection on Vlcksburjf street, near
Twenty-third. The roof of Hi's holding
was also blown off first jjtnJ the demoli
tion of the rest of tho framework was a
matter of only a few minute?. All ot the
Â¦workmen escaped -unscathed.
The children --ittendiner jsehr-ol vrere
mort or lees frishtcr.rrl dvringr the Mew,
but the teachers managed to preserve
order and discipline.
At the corner of Third nnu Market
peveral nccidents occurred. Shortly after
10 o'clock a wa;,'nn belonging to the In
dependent Electric J/ght Company' vras
turned ungide down by the :vtrÂ«?rÂ«jtli of
the gale. The driver 'fscnped-'v'th a f"w
scratches, but the her?", vh'o> waÂ«
blown over on its side, -vas. slightly in
jured. â¢
Humorous Incidents of Gale.
A large" ' covered dray was' being driven
down Market street, and on nearing the
. corner of Third, a gust of wind sot In
under the canvas and lifted the heavy
dray off the ground and dropped' it back
again with force enough to break tho hind
axle. The" canvas in the front 6f '*. the
wagon was torn from Us fastenings and
it switched over the driver's head. Had
It not been for the assistance of pedes
trians, who had all they could do to hold
their own feet,- a serious accident might
have occurred.
The gale was not. without its humorous
incidents. One man wearing a hroad
rimmed sombrero furnished belated citi
zens standing in the sheltered nooks
around Third and Market streets consid
arable fun. He was trying to cross. Third
street, when the wind lifted the sombrero
from his head and hurled it upward into
epace. It soared until it reached the
highest point of' the new building -going
- up on Market street. Just above Kcarny.
The owner of the hat watched its flight
with breathless Interest. Between the ef
fort it cost him to keep his feet and figure
out at the same time the possible landing
place of his sombrero the pedestrian was
in a sorry plight. The hat circled com
pletely around the iron plrdera and frame
work. of the new building as if it were a
bird, and. the distracted owner battled
with the elements as best he could in a
vain effort to reach the Geary-street side
of the building. When he' finally,suc
ceeded in fighting . his ' way around the
corner the hat had made another circle
of the building and was on the Market
street side. Much laughter was provoked
by this Incident.' The hat was finally car
ried ' away by the gale.
Â¦ Women and men . who attempted -to
carry, umbrellas across the windy corners
on Market street fared very badly. Some
were turned Inside out and 'the holders
of others were either thrown down on the
slippery pavements or dragged along, like
ships under sail. -

Special Dispatch to The CalL
SVN RAFAEL, Feb. 25.â Marln Coun
ty was visited to-day by the most
severe rain and wind storm that
has occurred here in years. Re
ports from all parts of the county
tell of destruction to crops and
property, while along the' water front at
Tiburon and Sausalito much havoc re
sulted to large boats and small craft.
Many dwellings were more or less dam
aged, trees were uprooted and fences torn
dewn. "Washouts occurred alone the
North Pacific Coast .and the California
Northwestern railroads, and during a
portion of the day passengers for San
Francisco via Tiburon were compelled to
return to this city. Ko trains were run
ning at any time to-day between here
ana Santa Rosa, owing to washouts on
the California Northwestern, while the
narrow-gauge did not attempt to run
cars over its track between this city and
San Quetin.
Passengers on the business men. s train
leaving this city at 7:45 this morning on
the broad-gauge . arrived at the Tiburon
ferry slip on time, but the Donahue got
under way late and had a hard time
reaching tne other side. The water being
rough in Raccoon Straits, she drifted far
out toward the heads. She had a great
many women passengers and there was
alrr.ost a panic on board several times
during her long trip over. On the second
run the Donahue broke her rudder and
laid up. This stopped all traiilc on tha
broad gauge until late , this afternoon,
when the Ukiah was put on the run..
The Amador and* Sausalito, from Sausa
lito, had rough trips. The Sauaalito, with
Captain -McKenzie, formerly of the San
Rafael, attempted to- make the first trip,
and, after running out a considerable dis
tance, stopped. It was, feared she would
have to return, but she finally finished
her trip to San Francisco.
The county road between Kent and
Mulheaxn is washed out for nearly a half
mile, while in many other sections long
stretches were damaged. The stage road
between this city and Bolinas has suffered
greatly. The mail reached- here late to
day. Telephonic communication with many
portions of the county is cut off, -while
the local lines in this vicinity are dam
aged.
The rainfall for the last twenty-four
hours has been more than three inches
and for the storm nearly seven, making
' the total for. the season 33 inches. Last
year's entire rainfall was 34 inches at this
place.
Child Saves a Life.
Arthur "Wells and Ralph Peterson,
young boys 'who reside In San Rafael, had
a narrow escape from drowning to-day in
a creek swollen by the rains. The former
fell into the stream and was almost ex
hausted when his companion, who had
Jumped in to the rescue, grabbed him by
the coat and swam out of danger. Young
"Wells was watching . the rushing waters
undermine a barn, and by some mishap
lost his footing and fell in. He could not
swim, and, owing -to the velocity of the
current, was being carried swiftly down
stream to certain death. Peterson, an ex
pert swimmer for his age (he i3 riot yet
11), without hesitation Jumped into the
creek, to rescue the older boy. After bat
tling with the waters he succeeded in
reaching "Wells and caught him just as he
was sinking the second time. By grsat ef
fort he succeeded in reaching the bank
with the almost unconscious lad. The two
boys landed many yards from where the
mishap occurred.
PETALDMA; Feb. ' 23.â The present
storm has caused the highest overflow in
Petaluma in twenty years.' Trade in the
lower part of town is conducted In boats.
ing up the net when the boat went over
and became entangled in it3 meshes.
Though an excellent swimmer, he came
near to drowning. But for the timely
assistance of Captain Harry Johnson and
Edward Casey, a hotel drummer, who
were coming m> the bay In a launch, both
brothers would have undoubtedly per
ished.
Julius was first pulled aboard. It was
with great difficulty and extreme peril to
themselves that those on the launch then
reached Basto, just as he was about
gone. The fishermen, were taken to the
fisherman's wharf, revived and then sent
to their homes.

STORM BELAYS SOLDIERS.
Government Tugs Cannot Transport
- Incoming Troops to the Presidio.
Two battalions of the Twenty-ninth In
fantry j arrived at the Oakland mole yes
terday morning en route to the Presidio,
where they are to be on duty pending
their departure for the Philippines. Tha
waters of the bay were so rough, how
ever, that the Government tugs did hot
dare venture to transport the troops
across the bay.. Arrangements were
finally made by the quartermaster to fur
nish the men with food and shelter in
Oakland until transportation could ba .
accomplished safely. There are reported Â¦;
to be five cases of measles among the
men of the command.
The Twenty-second Infantry, which re
turned Monday night on the transports
Rosecrans and Hancock, could not be
landed yesterday on account of the rough
weather, but will probably get into camp
at the Presidio to-day.
SCHOOL HOUSES SUITES.
Children Frightened by the Gale and
Quieted by the Teachers.
The high : wind blew several hundred
square feet, of roofing from the ' Bernal
School. The building was soon flooded
with rain and the pupils were dismissed
by the principal. The skylights on the
Hawthorne and Cleveland schools and a
chimney on the Irving, School were blown
off by the gale. The school children were
in their classrooms at the time the wintl
started to demolish the buildings, but the
presence of mind of the teachers pre
vailed and good order was maintained.
The damage to the buildings will bo re

Notice to Mariners.
THE army transport Hancock, which
arrived from Manila early yester
day morning, had probably one
of the roughest voyages that has
fallen to the lot of any of Uncle
Sana's soldier carriers. Between Febru
ary 9 and February 18 she fought her way
through a living gale. Two of her soldier
passengers were washed overboard and
crowned, but the big transport came
through the trial -witliout injury anrl
reached port on schedule time. She
brought about ninety cabin passengers, in
cluding General J. C. Breckinridge. the
Inspector General of the United States
army. Of soldiers she brought 333 enlist
ed men. 131 discharged soldiers, 93 sick. 10
insane, 19 discharged civilian employes of
the quartermaster' s department and 51 pris
oners. Of the latter four were mutinous
sailors from the American . bark Reaper.
There were three deaths during- the voy
age. Those who died were Private An
drew T. Christiansen, of Company L,
Thirtieth Infantry; Corporal W. H. Cole
man, Company E, Thirtieth Infantry, and
Private William Cleary. Troop D, Third
Cavalry. .. ".
Private "William E. "Webb, of the Hos
pital Corps, and Private Leslie C. Wager,
cf the Twenty-eighth Volunteers, were
washed overboard and drowned on Febru
ary 18. They were on deck In the after
part of the ship. Wager was thrown with
terrific violence against the rail and then
into the sea. The rail was considerably
bent, and it is thought that Wager was
dead before he struck; the water.- Webb
Reared the rail and could be seen in the
?water forvsome time. It was absolutely
Impossible, says Captain Ankers, to make
any attempt to pick up the unfortunate
men. The Hancock was. having all she
could do to hold her own, and stopping the
ship would have endangered the lives of
all on board. Even had this been pos
sible. Ankers says, ho boat could have
lived in the boiling sea. The army offi
cers on board bear out the: captain in
these particulars. Before reaching port
a testimonial to Captain Ankers was
drawn up and signed by every passenger.
It reads as follows:
' :â¢' U. S. A. T. Hancock,
' February 25, 1902.
To Captain George Ankers. Master United
States Transport Hancock â Dear Sir: We. the
undersigned passengers on the Hancock during
the voyare from Manila, P. I., to San Fran
cisco. February 1 to 25, 1902, desire to offer
you this testimonial to your skill, efficiency
and unceasing watchfulness as master, to
which qualifications we believe our present
comfort and safety to be due. Especially do
we commend your splendid conduct during the
fierce gate lasting from February 9 to 18, from
which the ship emerged without damage â a.
.fact due to your skillful management. ,Â¦
, w e wish you many years of success In your
profession. . . . . . ; .
The Hancock's time was: From Man
ila, 24 days, 11 hours ; from Nagasaki, 17
days, 5 hours. The Rosecrans. which ar-,
rived on Monday evening, was 31 days'

Thomas Barnes, a bollermaker, residing
In Anaconda, has : Invented \' and secured
patents" upon ; an improved safety vault
for the use of banks or mercantile houses,
that will, so the inventor claims, do away
with the wholesale robbing of banks and
business houses, poStofflces, etc., of which
there, has been so much during the past
season. . * :. â¢./.â¢Â¦'. . .- . â¢' -Â¦ --'-'A â¢.â¢'Â¦' *Â¦
.The fundamental idea of the new ; vault
; is to have it built in a conspicuous place
Ih the : building, 1 presumably in the ; front
of the room next to the street.
The vault is to be erected upon an up
right skeleton frame sufficiently ; elevated
from the floor, ot a bulling or the ground
to expose the lower eide of ; the, vault, 1 the
latter being built oh a net; work of hori
zontai floor, beams, tied together and held
engaged with 'their supports J by. -novel
means.' '^--'.- /'/ . Â¦Â¦'*Â¦,. *:- : :',' '.; . '".:. Â¦-. ;â¢-.
Â¦ The vault is completely. encompassed by
a gallery .that : affords heavy plate t , glass
sides that permit a free inspection'of .the
exterior. of the vault from the outside.
' By a clever,' arrangemerjt; of mirrors the
whole of the vault and the approaches to
it are made visible ; to those.; working : ' on
the ; Inside of the building; or: to^ persons
passing along!'. the',' street: ? Thus \ there : is
no i possible chance of tunneling to* reach
the vault and the mirrors arranged in the
roof and on the sides of the vault jwlll ex
pose any Â¦ person approaching the vault.
"Another M - advantage "-that "Mr.: Barnes
claims .for his invention -,- is " that it may,
be erected on; the second story. of a. build
ing v as easily as the first. In this manner
rooms are available. for banking purposes
which would not otherwise be so. :

WHILE the. unanimous vote in the House in
favor of the war tax repeal bill gives good
reason for expecting at least a majority- in
favor of it in the Senate, dispatches from Washington
indicate that" it .is by.no means sure the bill will be
accepted by the Senators in'its entirety. .It is already .
known the Senators will riot dealwith the subject;
hastily. It is saidthe Finance Committee of the Sen
ate, to whom the measure has been referred, 'will
make a thorough inquiry into the sufficieiicy- of the
present income of the Government to meet the
heavy appropriations which will be made at this ses
sion before reporting upon the Â¦ bill, . and that they
may reach the conclusion that it is riot expedient at'
this time tc repeal the whole of the war taxes.;- :
It is agreed^of course, that the revenues at present'
are excessive and that some reduction in taxes should
be made, but it is by, no means agreed that .the coun T ;
try can afford at this time a cut of upward of $8o,ooo,
oop in, annual revenues as the total repeal of the war
taxes would effect. ' Iv is ; pointed out that while the
pacification- of the .Philippines "has gone so far that 1
the numerical strength of the army of occupation-has
been reduced ,and expenses cut downjstill it is\esti-;
mated-the cost bf government in the islands this year
will 1 not â¢ fall short of $100,000,000, and, furthermore,
some account will ;have to' be '.taken of probable
exigencies, for rebellion^ may break out again at any
time. â¢
Another, factor in; the, problem is. the uncertainty,
that the revenues of . the Government .' from other
sources will continue to be so large in the coming .
year as they were -in the. past." Senator Aldrich ';is
quoted as having- skid ' recently: "The reduction
made in taxation . by the t last Congress resulted in Â¦
cutting down the internal revenue receipts since
July. rto this date. upward: of $19,000,000, but a" large

N 'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦"'.-
ONE of the significant features of political. dis-;
; cussion atthis time is the general expression
. : of; disrespect for the House of Representa
tives as a legislative body. The press of all sections
and of all parties discusses "the decline of the
House," and; points out that the Representatives
have virtually abdicated their functions as represen
tatives of the people and have turned their branch of
Congress into something like a nullity.
It-', is 'easy to recall . a time when very different .
opinions prevailed. It is not long ago that, the;
House was commended because it shut off. debate
and promptly 'dealt with whatever measure came be
fore it. ; In those days popular condemnation rested
upon .the Senate. There were 'Clamors for reform in
the Senate. - It, was even suggested that it would be
a good idea to; elect Tom Reed to that body so that
he v could introduce the Reed rules, put an end to
long-winded' speeches and bring matters to a con
clusion./;' "'"'"Â¦".
The explanation of the change of public sentiment
is to" be found in the changed nature of our political
problems. The issues' of tariff rates and ; of free silver '
had been argued until the people were' tired. 1 When:
it came for. Congress^ to act Â¦ no one cared to hear fur
ther debate. The country . needed Â¦ and demanded ac
tion. .The course of the House in shutting off
bate was therefore approved, while the Senate, where
the "talk, went on for 'weeks and months, was de
nounced as ah obstruction and a nuisance. Atthis time
there are new issues to* the front.' Upon questions "of
legislation, arising from .our, possession of ; the Philip-^
pines and our , relations to j Cuba, the public j is' not yet
wearied of debate:, . Hence the House is now con-,
demned for, being over hasty and the Senate wins '
golden opinions for permitting a; full and free discus
sion^ qf- every issue that; arises.v
' : /There can * be : no" questioning' the* fact . that the ;
House has carried its; obstruction; to debate too far. Â¦
Ithas' passed a NicaraguVcana) .bill, -not after full dis-J
cussion, ; but hurriedly, and has left it for the Senate to '
decide 'whether ..the canal shall ~ be constructed 'by'
that route or another Â¦' It sent the i Philippine tariff :
bill . and the war- tax bill up ; to .the { Senate ; in the same -
hasty' way./ These measures I will have. to -be discussed;
elaborately in the Senate because they . have not been v
discussed ratr.all in the ; House. _By r its action in this Â¦
respect, the House has lost its prestige " in legisiation^
and- its influence with' the, country. It will do well" in
it make arevision of its rules; The; representatives oft
the people, have- no right to gag themselves for the
mere sake , of crushing a minority and putting an fend â¢'

ENERAL WILL S. GREEN and his asso
| T ciatts have impressed upon San Francisco
commerce the benefit to this city of the
proper development and settlement of what is known
geographically as Northern California. It is ..the
granary, orchard and vineyard of San Francisco, the â¢
zone ' of production, whose commercial drainage is
to this city, and San Francisco cannot do its duty to
itself by overlooking- this fact.
In the vdleys and foothills of this part of the State
slumber resources and possibilities and a potential
wealth greater than hiive been the boast of empires.
Tillage, irrigation, settlement, small, holdings and en
terprise are required in their development. Southern
California has resource s peculiar to that region. Her
dry and bright winter climate attract an increasing
tourist travel, the profits from which are as legitimate
and as generally diffused as the profits of land culti
vation in the north. At this moment the hotels,
resorts arid private houses of that part of the State
are bulging with refugees from the * harsh Eastern
winter. Bankers are sleeping on billiard tables,
their wives arc swinging in hammocks, while earlier
and luckier comers nestle in beds. We are glad that
this is soi But we must make it known to the indus
trial and rural classes of the. East that Northern
California - is also a winterless land, and while it
makes no specialty of tourist travel the advantages
of its climate run to the permanent settler and tiller
In this region are thermal belts from Porterville
to Oroville, where cititts fruits flourish untouched by
frost or scale. Everywhere the olive, fig, grape,
pomegranate and palm grow in a balmy air. In the
cities and by the country roads where date seeds' are
cast away by caters of the fruit the date palm springs
up and grows, as oaks spring from acorns in the East.
It is a land flowing with milk and honey, and full
of corn and wine, waiting to be wrought upon by
human industry. . 'Â¦'Â¦\.;;i-";; i '.
It has been a region of large land holdings. In
it were the great Mexican grants and the enormous
plantations. But these, at first profitable as stock
ranges and vast wheat fields, are no longer so, in !
the hands of holders who do not personally till them.
So their subdivision into small holdings has become
an economic and financial necessity, and is progress
ing rapidly. What small holdings, well tilled, will do
under the personal supervision of the owner may be
feen in Tulare County, in Fresno and in that- most
beautiful foothill and mountain region in the world,"

Up one side of the great valley of California, from
PorterVille to Chico, and down the other from Red
ding to Vacaville, and on the level of the wide val
ley between, lie* the best and richest part of the
earth, the most various in its resources and in its
productions. Collateral to it are Santa Maria,
Salinas, Santa Clara, Russian River, Napa and the
other full, jeweled valleys of the Coast Range, pre
senting a -majesty of scenery and, maze of resources
which confuse the mind with an embarrassment of
riches. All is to be. touched . into life by a union of
country improvement associations, the commercial
bodies of San Francisco and the railroads, all pulling

SOME time ago The Call -directed attention to
an article by, Professor "Shalef. of Harvard pre-
: dieting a large increase- in the output of gold
by reason of the discovery of new gold fields arid '
the: increased facilities, for working them brought
about by the advancement of, science and the applica
tion of new inventions for mining. That paper, by
treason Â¦ of the eminence of its author and the seem
ingly sound basis of its arguments and conclusions,
naturally gave rise to, a, good deal of discussion! Â¦'.
Gold is a "very important . factor in the commerce
and finance. of the world,, and anything likely to
materially increaseor diminish the supply inevitably
arouses interest throughout the civilized world.
.'While the .arguments of Professor Shaler Â¦ were
strong they, were to a large.' extent speculative. They
proceeded upon. the i .assumpti6n,.that. -.new^ gold fields,,
in Alaska and Australia would add 'to'.the annual' out- "j
put, that the production" of South Africa would in- i
crease as soon as the mines. could; be again worked, <
and that the improved appliances for 1 mining would
augment the product . : of .old mine's, so that; in the 1
aggregate the product of the future would be con- j
siderably in excess of that of. the past." Such argu-.
ments have an. unquestioned validity, but the Finan
cial Chronicle of New York points out that the facts
of gold production do not correspond to thV theory.
In fact, jthe output of gold under present conditions
appears to .have reached its climax and is now re
ceding. _.-..;.
' Taking official estimates of the world's output for
recent years the Chronicle presents . statistics show
ing, an increase up to 1899 'and' a decrease since
that time. Since 1896 the^ figures" are tabulated thus:
. V- Fine'. Ounces." Value.

1901 .......12,894,344. 266,549,300
It will be seen that for" a time the increase in the 7
output of gold was very rapid, but of; late years there
has been a decrease. A similar condition of affairs
occurred upon the discovery of gold f in 5 California
and Australia. .For a time there was an enormous
advance in production, but lateivon ,a decline set t in.
Basing conclusions upon the facts of history the esti
mate is made that the richest yield of the new mines,
whether in Africa, Alaska or Australia, has been al
ready obtained and that we are not likely to' have
any further increase unless new. gold discoveries are
made. , .
; It will be perceived that the argument against Pro
fessor Shaler's theory is hardly better than that of the
professor himself.- The subject is one upon which
no certain forecast can be made. It may be that the'
decline in production since 1899. is due only to a tem
porary check, and; that there: will be -another period
of increase in the near future. It appears, hOweveV
that the output is too uncertain and ': too j liable to'
checks for any one to be seriously afraid that we shall
have>uch an enlarged production of gold as to dis
turb Â¦ values and wreck the existing " monetary
sVstem. 1 .'.'Â¦''Â¦Â¦

THIv President, bad invited Senator Tillmari to
dine at the -.White House with Henry of Prus-v
sia, and the \ Senator had \ accepted. Â¦ Between
the acceptance and the dinnerâ between the cup and
the lip, as it were â the Senator, in pursuance of his
policy of aspersing the conduct and impugning the
motives of other Sen2tors, / accused his .colleague of
an offense the most serious of which a member of
that' body can be guilty. The "were
such as. greatly to try the Senator who was accused,
and he immediately declared tKe accusation to be a
gross; deliberate and willful falsehood. Then Till
man rose and smote him on the ear, and was. in turn
smitten on the nose.
This occurred in the open session of the Senate.
The combatants fought until. they were separated by
the officers of the Senate, and then were adjudged
guilty of contempt and their Senatorial functions
were suspended until the Senate chooses to restore
them. . There have been high times arid passionate
I passages in the Senate before, but we believe no
blow was ever landed, before by one Senator upon,
the body .of another. during a session of that body.

was in the chamber, but not during a session. Fo.ote
walked down the aisle and drew a weapon' on Ben
ton, who opened his coatand cried, "Let the assas
sin fire!" but the trigger was not pulled. Clay and
Randolph went to Bladensburg to fight, and the Sen
ate in session has not before been the. scene of actual
combat." / â¢ - / ' -' '
Say what one may 'about the Ignited States Senate,
it has deserved its fame as the most dignified legis- '
Iative body in the world. To tarnish that fame is no
light matter. Tillman was the aggressor in the act
that has done this. If the^. President had disregarded
his act and the resulting suspension" he would have
improperly condoned the highest offense that has
been' committed in our Senatorial history. If Till
man had?more than a barbarian's sense of the fitness
oh things he would have voluntarily recalled his ac
ceptance of the dinner invitation, frankly giving as a
reason that he was under "suspension and did not de
sire, to embarrass the President. - But ~ such, pro
prieties do not occur to the South Carolina Senator,
and he compelled the President? to recall" the invita
tion.
His conduct is consistent with his whole course
since he entered the Senate. His' "pitchfork" speech,
the first -he made in that chamber, was a coarse and
brutal and false attack upon President Cleveland and
Secretary Carlisle. It violated every rule of the Sen
ate set up to preserve the decencies of debate. It.
aspersed in the most outrageous manner the Presi
dent of the United- States, accused him falsely of
crimes, the guilt of which should have subjected him
not only to impeachment but to prosecution in the
criminal courts and to. punishment by imprisonment.'
From that beginning Senator Tillman has cease
lessly. nagged, accused, aspersed and abused other
Senators in every discussion in which he has taken
part. He has at no time engaged in a philosophical
discussion of principles or measures. He has uttered
no word that becomes a statesman, and has con
tributed nothing of merit to the political literature
of his time. His inconsistencies are well illustrated
in this last affair. He attacked McLaurin for voting
for the Spanish treaty. Yet he supported Bryan in
1900, and. Bryan boldly claimed the credit, for in
ducing Senators, on liis side to ratify the treaty. It Â¦
was ratified by, one vote, and it is not denied that that
vote, cast by ; a Southern Senator, was secured by
Mr. Bryan. Had he stayed away, from Washington
the 'treaty would have been amended and made dis
tinctly declarative . of our Philippine policy. After .
supporting Bryan in 1900, stumping Northern .States
in his interest and insisting even now that the party
shall continue under his leadership, Tillman turns
upon McLaurin and makes a vile attack upon him
for following Bryan's leadership!
He seems incapable of seeing any but a criminal
or improper motive for any act antagonistic to his
views. He has declared over and over again in the
Senate that those who oppose him are corrupt and
dishonest, and at last his brutal and ungovernable
temper has led to an act which the Senate must pun
ish and which the President cannot condone.
We are aware that there are those in the country
who \vill approve, his conduct. So no doubt there
are those who would like to see the Justices of the
Supreme Court fall foul of each other and fight on
the bench. But the vast majority of our' people
prize the decency and the dignity of official life and
will support the Senate and the President in uphold
ing -them. â¢ .: '" .'Â¦ . ;:

by Attorneys Barnes and Farquar.for the

to the jury and Judge Kerrigan then read
his legal Instructions. â¢
Attorney Collins denounced Anderson aa
a' "moral : viper" and a "villain of the

of being called a :man.\ He scored-An
derson as a trifler and accused the Klon
diker of having not : only lacerated the
heart and affections of Miss Alma . de
Bretteville, but of coming into court and
besmirching her character. . The attorney
argued that the evidence in the case
showed that Anderson had engaged him
self to marry Alma and had showered
presents on her and then cast her aside.
He declared that the record in the divorce
suit t)f Anderson proved the mining man
to be a wrecker of feminine happiness,
and that ' he ought to be â¢ taught that
American women were sacred' from his
pollution and touch.! He asked that the

Alma' de bretteville was
awarded the sum of $1230 and
costs last evening by the Jury
that heard the evidence in the
young woman's breach of prom
ise suit against Charles J. Anderson, the
reputed Klondike Croesus.
Both the fair plaintiff and the ever-
Emiiing Uefendant were present in court
when the finding of tne jury was an
nounced. Â¦ Miss de Bretteville was sur
rounded by her relatitves when the fore
man .informed Judge Kerrigan that the
verdict was for the lady. She smiled,
gave a sigh of relief and, rising in her
seat, bowed to the jurors and said, "I
thank you, gentlemen."
Anderson broadened the grin on his
face and, turning to Counsel "Billy''
Barnes, said he felt satisfied.
The defendant then Informed his attor
â¢ neys that he would make no further flght
In the eult. but that he would pay up like
a man.
The case was given to the jury at* 5:30
p. m. and the verdict was rendered an
hour later. The Jury took ten ballots be
fore arriving at a final decision. One of
the j+irors voted for the defendant on
Â«?ach Occasion. On the first ballot the
damages ranged from $1 to $25,000, and the
jurors eventually compromised on the
sum announced in their verdict.
Plaintiff Weeps: Freely.
Ella. Wheeler Wilcox, .the poetess of
rassion. was brought into the case yes
terday by counsel tor Anderson, and Mil
ton, Byron and other famous writers
were quoted with rapidity by the at
torneys.
Miss Alma de Bretteville, the fair plain
tiff, was in sympathy with the leaden
skies that poured their torrents over the
streets of the city. The young lady wept
and wept whenever her attorney referred
to her lacerated heart, and Charley An
derson, the Klondike defendant, broad
ened Into his perpetual smile while he lis
tened to th.e denunciations of Alma's law
yers or the poetic defense made by Cap
tain "Billy" Barnes and the staid Far
quar.
The day was mainly spent in the argu
ments of counsel to. the jury. The fair
plaintiff was on the witness stand for a
short period. In order that she might deny
the allegations made by Anderson .in
court. The arguments, of the attorneys
were not, confined to the testimony in the
case. They consisted of fierce denuncia
tions, and if Judge Kerrigan had- not lim
ited the time the city might have been
called upon to pay a heavy gas* bill, for
the lawyers were determined to win their
causes even if they held the jury all night.
When the hearing of the case was re
sumed at the morning session, the first
witness called by the defense was Mrs.
Kitty Oakes, the landlady of the house
where the opulent Anderson resides, , at
237 Golden Gate avenue. :
Mrs. Oakea testified that Anderson had
i resided in her house for some months and
that the De Bretteville family constantly
called there to see the defendant, and
that she had orders from him not to ad
mit them on any occasion. The evidence
j of Mrs. Oakes was given for the purpose
of contradicting the plaintiff that neither
Â»ho nor her relatives had "run after" the
defendant. . â¢
Plaintiff Again Testifies.
The defense then Introduced the judg
ment roll of the divorce . proceedings by
which Anderson's -wife, was separated
from her spouse. *. r
Gus de Bretteville told how at the Cliff
House the defendant "had ordered cock
tails for an entire party, and" consumed
those ordered for the ladies, including the
plaintiff.
Â¦ Alma de Bretteville was called. to rebut
the testimony, given- by Anderson. The
young lady was dressed In a blue tailor
made gown and wore a black - hat with i
ostrich plumes, and she -made a good im
pression with the Jury and the spectators
who filled the courtroom. ',
' The plaintiff denied " that she had' ever
asked Anderson for , money â¢Â¦ to : buy Â¦ â¢ an
, opera cloak or any. other article of, wear-
Ing apparel. She denied that he had ever
given her ?60 as part payment for a cloak
or that he had given her money for music
lessons or' tuition in painting.
"I paid for my own lessons," sald'AIma,
"for -five years before I ever set eyes upon

An inspection of the 13ohldig fiats fol
lowed, and it was demonstrated to the
satisfaction of everybody that they af
forded a view of the back vard of the san
itarium. This seemed to be about all the
evidence that could be gathered in the
neighborhood.
Last night Judge Fritz, accompanied by
Attorney Herron of the defense and C. D.
Bohldig, the complaining witness, and his
attorney, George Montelth, made an in
spection of the sanitarium and some of
the neighboring houses in order that the
mighti clear up.eome questions of
fact which the conflicting testimony had
engendered in his mind. The first call was
at the sanitarium, where the party was
received in a cozy parlor by Mrs. Atkin
son and her Titian-haired daughter. On
the piano were some pieces of music, in
cluding the "Holy City" and "Stay In
Your Own Back Yard." which may have
been there purely by accident. " The house
did not look like the shainbles the prose
cution had sought to represent it All of
the rooms were cleanly and well fur
nished. Some of those upstairs had iron
screens over the windows, which were
claimed to be necessarv as a precaution
ary measure, but in no sense crueL J.
Howard Ewing, "the "bogie .man" of the
institution, who, according to the prose
cution, used such kindly ministrations to
ward the patients as dragging them about
by the hair, acted as .guide through the
Institution. The famous back yard, where
the prosecution claims such dark deeds
were done, was also inspected.
Then the Guggenheim household next
door was Invaded, and Miss Guggenheim,
a pretiy young lady with decided views
regarding the sanitarium, introduced the
Judpe to the parrot. Judge Fritz tried
vainly to induce Polly to say "Stella" or
"Amelia," but he could only extract low,
guttcral responses to his advances. Miss
Guggenheim was elated. But no sooner
h^d the Judge withdrawn from the room
than the gorge of the parrot arose, and it
started a series of shrieks that could dis
count a delirium tremens patient. There
was a scurry of skirts toward the kitchen,
where the cage hung, a stifled, wailing
cry, and all was silent. Polly had been
disciplined for indiscretion.
The trial of Mrs. Reeves Atkinson on
the charee of maintaining a nuisance at
1S13 Sinter street is drawing to a close in
Judge Fritz's court. Yesterday the de
fense closed its case and the prosecution
brought forward four witnesses in re
buttal, who devoted their attention to the
famous Guggenheim parrot.
Dr. Thurlow Miller testified for the de
fense that he had been with patients all
jueht in the sanitarium and never heard
cny unusual noises.
Howard Ewing, the chief attendant,
was recalled and then the defendant took
the stand. She made a general denial of
all the charges brought by the numerous
witnesses for the prosecution. The
.Morgue wagon had never visited her
piaoe; there never were any unusual
ncises, night or day, and the place was
always quiet and orderly. If the neigh
bors would attend to their own business
instead of raising their windows and
making remarks to the patients while in
the yard there would be no cause for
complaint, she declared. Guggenheim's
l-arrot was always noisy during the day
and annoyed the patients, but it had'been
removed recently, the lady said. Mrs. Al
ma Iveith. was always kindly treated in
the institution, but she was a troublesome
patient. They parted on friendly terms
when she left. The "Holy City" had been
sung in the parlor with piano accompa
niment, but not by patients. In cross
examination the names of several pa
tients were mentioned as being: noisy, but
the witness denied that they had been so.
In rebuttal Mrs. F. A. Kelton, Mrs.
Laura Turkel, Mrs. Amy Casey and Mrs.
Theresa Peters were called. They live In
the neighborhood and testified they had
never heard Guggenheim's parrot cair out
"Amelis." Mrs. Casey thought she hal
heard it call out "Stella."

gentlemen." Â¦ Â¦ * . â¢
"Did you ever ask Him for diamond
rings or any other presents?" asked At
torney Collins.
Says Charley Owes Her Four Bits.
The fair plaintiff at this point broke
into a violent fit of tears and .hysterically
declared that Anderson was trying to
blacken her character, and begged Judge
Kerrigan to protect her. , , ' Â¦_-
Although Judge Kerrigan is young in
years, he gave the young lady words ot
consolation and succeeded in Inducing her
to dry her eyes. Then the plaintiff told
how on -one occasion Anderson had taken
her to get ice cream soda and he did not'
have any change with him.
"He borrowed 50 cents from me to pay
for the soda," said Alma, "and he has
never repaid me." And the spectators
toughed heartily. ' -
â¢ Miss .de Bretteville told of the occasion
v/hen' she: went to Â¦ the grand operalwlth
Anderson. She declared that she haa not
requested him to purchase tickets for.' the
appearance of Grau's lyric stars, but that
the gay Charley, fresh from the Klon
dike, desired to see his name in the news
papers as being "among those present."
"He wanted to go to the opera," said
the plaintiff, "and he. hired a dress suit.
He went down town to buy two seats,
but he came back and told me that he
cnuld not secure two seats, so he had
purchased an entire box. Rather than
have the seats not used, I asked him to
invite my family."
The plaintiff then denied that she had
requested Anderson to buy her a riding
habit or a horse or any diamond rings,
a3 the defendant had claimed.
She Refused Many Presents.
"I refused many presents from 'him,"
said Alma, as she looked with scorn at
the little defendant. . '
"I tank I bay mooch in lock If shay hav
not taaken ony dings from may," whis
pered Anderson to Attorney Barnes, who
asked his client- to maintain decorum in
court. â¢
Hiss de Bretteville traveled over the
ocean cocktail route as- it appeared In
evidence in the case. She positively de
nied that she had ever taken a drink of
liquor, when accompanied by Anderson on
a drive or that Mrs. J^undberg had en
joyed the product of the skill of a mix
ologist, at the Cliff House or the Troca
dero.
".Anderson ordered drinks for all the
party," said Alma, "but Mrs. Lundberg
and myself did not drink .the cocktails.
We ore ladies, and ladies don't take cock
* tails.' . ,
Alma shed tears strain when Attorney
ColJirs asked her if she had kissed An
derson the first time they went driving.
She finally composed herself .and denied
having taken that liberty with the mil
lionaire from the frozen north. '.
She was then asked when was the first
time kissing had ever been discussed be
tween them, and she replied that it was
ore evening after she had visited the
theater.
Ho\?l Charley Made Love.
Â¦ 'ICaptain and Mrs. L-undberg and An
derson were in the party," s.aid the plain
tiff, "and - when we got out of Ihe car
Captain and Mrs. Lundberg waited on
the corner while Anderson took me to
my. house. At the door Anderson asked
me to give him a kiss. I told him that
I did not kiss strangers, and he begged
ray pardon."
"When did he klssÂ»you?"
', "After we were engaged. We became
engaged about three weeks afjer we first
met." â¢ ' ' Â¦ r. â¢:.
"What took place when he kissed you?
What did he say?!' Â¦;;Â¦:Â¦.-Â¦
"He always said to me, 'Oh, Alma,
darling, give me a kiss, it makes me so
happy; don't be cruel to me and refuse.' "
The witness then denied that she had
ever discussed .divorce with Anderson or
asked him to. take her to Mexico or
Nevada and there marry her. Alma-fur
ther denied speaking to Anderson about
the loss of her garter the first time they
went driving. :
"I never swoke to him or any one elss
about garters," said Alma, drawing her
self up with pride. "1 never discuss such
subjects with men." . ..Â¦â¢'.-.
Attorney Barnes :tnen cross-examined
the plaintiff and : she * admitted that she '
was surprised, to Â¦ receive a pair of gold
mounted garters as a present from. An
derson. ' . .. . . â¢ .
"Did you keep them?" asked Barnes. â¢'â¢-
"Yes, 1 did," was the reply. â¢
"Were you also surprised to receive the
rings?" >Â¦'Â¦â¢Â¦â¢Â«Â¦ *.v - Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦".-,.: â¢".,.;-/-.â¢.-.*

Barnes Takes Back His Silver.
Barnes then' asked Alma if' Andergon
owed her 50 - cents that he ; had borrowed
to pay for ice cream soda, and she replied
in the ' affirmative: ; .
, "Permit me to repay you the amount,"
said Barnes vwith the grace of . a Beau
Brummel, as he walked towaÂ»d the wit
ness with'a half dollar in his : hand. '-' '
Collins made a vigorous objection, which
was sustained, and Barnes returned to his
seat, remarking, "Well, , I am 1 50 , cents in

"St. Louis Frank," one of the footpads
implicated In the killing of Policeman Rob
inson, has been moved to another cell In
the Emergency Hospital. This action was
taken last evening by the police by reason
of information received that an attempt
was to be made by the prisoner's friends
to bring about his rescue. A policeman
has been stationed outside the prisoner's
cell and a cloae watch will be kept upon
him during, his convalescence.
' Mrs. Kane, matron of the Emergency
Hospital, overheard certain people plot

The latter detailed Detectives Dinan and

JTTST "JIMMY" BRITT THE BOXER," IN HIS STORM COAT SEEKING A LITTLE RELAXATION "AFTER HE
HAS FINISHED HIS DAY'S TRAINING ON THE ROAD AND IN THE GYMNASIUM IN ANTICIPATION
OF HIS 'MEETING WITH HEGARTY ON FRIDAY NIGHT. . . ' .
General Breckinridge, In discussing the
Philippine situation last evening, said:
. The islands cannot be said ;to be entirely
pacified, for a certain amount of Â¦ guerrilla
warfare is going on. . The military forces are
not operating to any great extent -just now,
as this is the rainy season. - Last year the
troops vwere out. in the field during the entire
we? season, but they were not able to accom
plish a great deal. By waiting until the dry
season greater results can be accomplished.
I expect athat after the rainy season is over
the soldiers will penetrate to the interior points
of the islands and being about peace.
While in Manila ' I paid some, attention to
the municipal police and consider them a very
fine body of men. They are all ' former sol
diers, trim, alert and activr, and veiy dif
ferent from the fat and cumbersome patrol
men you see on the. streets of New Tork . or
Chicago.
While in the Philippines I visited forty dif
ferent posts and found that there is room for
great improvements. The Â¦Â¦ posts - were . much
better, however, than I expected to find them.
The signal corps has done glorious work on
the islands. That branch of the service has
lost more men than any other department. I
believe that if the* strength of the signal corps
was doubled down there the .work would be
quadrupled. Tou must understand that the
conditions in the Philippines are far different
from in this country. There you cannot send
a body of men hundreds' of miles. In express
trains. The greatest protection there is found
in the telegraph. While you may be unable to
send troops to a spot in an -instant you can,
however,' learn -the real , situation by flashes
over the wire and act as the situation de
mands.
The schools In the islands are flourishing.
The native Filipino thirsts after knowledge and
American, ideas. The white teachers who have
gone to the Philippines are accomplishing
great results, but Iwqulcf like to see the same '
course pursued toward the islands aa was '
done toward Cuba. . Hundreds of native
teachers of Cuba were. sent to this country to
study our methods andt gain a practical knowl-"
edge of America and American ways. I be
lieve that it would be a great -thing If native
teachers of the Philippines were sent here to
study our form of government. TheyAvoulct
then bo better able to explain to their/schol
ars our methods. f
I think that <the day is not far distant when
Manila will have a population of a million in
habitants â :yes. a million and. a half, .It is a.
great seaport city and the history of the world
shows that all great seaports with magnificent
harbors have grown rapidly. A= tunnel should
be built under Manila bay so as .to establish a
better means of communication between the
shores'. It would, however, take many years
to build, and would cost a large fortune. Â¦
' The Philippines are valuable possessions. I
remember the time that I first came West to
Leavenworth, Kan. It was In 1350 and the
plains were studded with prairie schooners.
Thousands of . emigrants -were troins West and
a great cry. went up- in the East that thesa
people v were moving to a section of country
that wa3 not worth having. To-day that sec
tion of t the country Is rich and prosperous.
The people who are now talking against the
Philippines will find some day that they -wera
as far off as those who years ago ran down
the West. V

EVENING AT HOME B"$
THE OBDEB OF AMEBICTJS
During the meeting: of the Police Com- -
missloners last evening the member* j of.
the board discussed the advisability of
recommending to the Board of Super
visors that they raise the liquor license
in this city. Some of the Commissioners
were in favor of charging the saloon
keepers from . three to five times tho
amount they pay annually at present. The
Police Committee of th.5 Board of Super
visors will be Invited v: attend the next
meeting of the board 10 that they will
gain a practical idea of the- necessity oC
raising the license. The Police Depart
ment is in need of more officers an!
equipment and the Commissioners be
lieve a higher license will add a vast sum
to the municipal fund and the City
Fathers will be then better able to grant
the request of the department for a
larger appropriation.
â¢ Attorney John S. Partridge appeared be
fore the -board and presented a. petition
from the residents of South San Fran
cisco for better police protection. He
stated that the three officers stationed m
that vicinity were not able to render suf
ficient service by reason of the large dis
trict . they have to cover. The .attorney
further stated that there were a large
number of grading camps in that neigh
borhood and that their followers have
committed many acts of violence.
Chief Wittman Informed the commission
that owing to the limited number of po
licemen under him it was Impossible to
detail more men to protect South San
Francisco. If he did so, he said, he would
have ,to strip- some other part of the city.
I Commissioner Hutton advised the peti
tioners to lay the. matter before the Su
pervisors so that when they learn of tha
needs of the department they might ap
propriate more Â¦ money to better protect
the city. "â
The entire matter was turned over to
the Chief, who will use his judgment as
to whether It will be possible to detail
more men for So.uth San Francisco.
Mr. Schwartz, proprietor of the Thalia:
Charles J. Lenhardt, representing Kapp Â«t
Street's, and Mr: Walterstein of the-
Olympia appeared before the commission
and promised not to allow drinks to b<a
sold in rooms behind the stage and their
licenses were renewed. ,
John Lackman, the policeman who fired,
shots to scare a restaurant keeper named
Leary, who was running away, believing 1
him to be a footpad, will be brought be
fore the Police Commissioners at its next
meeting to explain his action.

Mr." Ruef offered Auditor Baehr's an

argued that the Supreme Court had in
the case of Kahn vs. Sutro declared that
the Supervisors ,,were municipal officers.
He showed that they necessarily must be
such, as the State law provides for only
five Supervisors in other counties, where
as the Charter of San Francisco provides
for eighteen. Mr. Ruef claims that tho
State law has no power to. impose upon
the municipal Board of Supervisors the
duty of electing a State officer, namely,-, a
Justices' Clerk, if he be a State officer.
"Therefore," said. Ruef, vjf the Justices'
Clerk is a State officer, he cannot be ap
pointed .under Section 86 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, as that section is in
valid, because it attempts to impose upon
municipal Supervisors a State duty."
Mr. Ruef contended that the office of
Justices' Clerk was purely a "municipal
affair," and the Mayor, therefore, had a
righ;t to act as he did under Section 6.

Festetics claimed that his wife had no
legal residence In California and there

In her complaint she stated that she had
resided in. this State "for ten years pre
vious to the filing of the petition for di

SUES FOR DAMAGES. â August E. Drucker
filed a suit for $2585' damages against the Mar
ket Street liailway Company, yesterday for in
juries received tn a tail from a. Devisadero
etrett car last December.
The repcrt that Mrs. Watt gave away some
stocks prior to her death is true. She gave
to her sister. Mrs. Foster, stocks of a tin cor
poration valued at $40,000, in order that she
might have e. steady income for the support of
herself and two widowed daughters. This
gift was concurred in by the other heirs, who
had no desire of thwarting Mrs. Watt's dispo
sition of her own property In any respect what
soever. Mrs. Watt -vvas a very estimable
woman and her relations With her sisters and
brother were most harmonious. The first will
Â¦was destroyed by Mrs. Watt, who desired to
make other disposition of her estate. .How
reports -as to a probable contest could have
arisen I have no means of knowing. I do
know, however, that there will be no litigation
other than that necessary for the probate of
the wilL
Acting on the advice of Attorney Cres
Â¦well. Plater entered at once upon the dis
charge of his duties as executor of the
-will. ,Â« He has -taken possession of all of
Mrs. Watt's personal property . contained
in the apartments of the deceased at the
Hotel St. Nicholas. An inventory, of this
is being made for presentation to the
court.
Crave Stocks to Her Sister.
I was Mrs. "Watt's attorney at the time her
husband'E will vraÂ£ probated and continued to
Â£ive her professional advice until her death.
While her husband's estate was In probate a
year ago she directed me to draw up a will
for her, as she intended to make a tour of the
world. I did so, and the document was filed
away. A lew days prior to her death I was
sent, {or and directed to make another will,
â¢which I did in Mrs. Watt'e presence. There
were present on that occasion Mr. and Mrs.
Plater and Mrs. Foster, all of whom I have
known for more than twenty years. Mrs.
Watt expressly desired and so ordered that her
estate should go to her three sisters and
brother.
Mrs. Watt died on the ISth lnst. in' her
richly appointed quarters at the Hotel St.
Nicholas. It was known that she had a
valuable estate and many rumors were
circulated concerning her disposition of it.
One report was that she died without hav
ing made a will and another that her en
tire wealth would go to a grandson living
in. Sacramento. Both of these reports
were false. Mrs. Watt executed a will a
few days prior to her death and devised
her estate to her, three sisters and broth
er. Â«5he left no issue, her only child hav
ing died in infancy.
The will devises" the estate to a sister,
the wife of J. E. Plater, the well-known
banker of Los Angeles; a sister, Mrs.
Mary R. Foster, living at 2930 Clay street;
a brother, James Patterson, living lnÂ«Sac
ramento, and to. another sister 'living in
the East. Each olthose named is to have
an equal share of the estate and Plater Is
named as executor of the will.
Sensational Humors Denied.
A sensational rumor which gained some
credence was to the effect that Mrs. Watt
had given a large portion of her property
to unknown persons prior to her death
and that litigation would be instituted by
the heirs for its recovery. Mr. Plater de
nied yesterday that any such intention ex
isted or that Mrs. Watt had given away
any considerable sum of money without
the full knowledge and consent of her sis
ters and brother, all of whom she devoted
ly loved.
Attorney Creswell said yesterday that
he was not aware that any reports had
been in circulation tending to show that
litigation would attend the probate pro
ceedings. Resuming, he said:
The will of Mrs. Hattie Watt, widow of
the late mining man. Charles Watt, one of
the principal owners "of the Brown Bear
mine at Deadwood, will 'be nied for pro
bate to-day by Attorney Harry T. Cres
well. The estate left by the decedent is
valued at $200,000, and consists largely of
stocks, cash and real estate. *

AUTHOR AND PHYSICIAN
"Writes Interesting Tale.
The author of "Under Palmetto and
Pine," "Norma Trist," "Four Years on
Wheels," etc.. Dr. J. "W*. Carhart of La
Grange, Texas, in addition to his literary-
efforts is a hard-working physician in
general practice.
He writes interestingly of how his free-
dom from heart trouble was gained by
leaving off coffee and using Postum in
its place. "I drank coffee in the ordinary
lorm for many years; nervous trouble,
involving disturbance of the heart's ac-
tion, resulted.
On coming to Texas I fell into the
habit of drinking coffee after hard, cold
rides in my practice cr when In camp or
on the trail. My heart trouble soon be-
came exceedingly aggravating, resulting
in frequent attacks of what was pro-
nounced angina pectorls, a severe agon-
izing pam over the heart extending to the
back and sometimes -down the left arm.
In some of these attacks but for the ;
timely administration of morphine inject-
ed hypodermically I could have survived
but a short time. ,
At. different trmes I abandoned the use
of coffee, believing it the cause of my j
â¢troubles, and invariably Improved, but as j
I had nothing satisfactory to take its !
place in the way of a beverage I returned,
to its use. ,â¢
The literature or Postum Cereal Coffee
came to my notice and I resolved to try
; it. The directions for preparation were !
strictly followed and I found it an agree- j
able, appetizing-, invigorating-' table bev-
erage. I continued its use in my family
for the past yearjar.d a half or two years,
durhig which time I have never had an j
attack of my old heart trouble, am capa- j
ble now at the age of 67 years and do as
much professional and literary work as
at any period of my life. I can endure
physical exercise without weariness but
with zest and relish, and fca'O-e gained In
weight from 134 pounds to 165 pounds."
The doctor further refers to th*e wide
spread prevalence of heart .. trouble from
the use of coffee and tobacco, and speaks j
of the advantage gained by patients i
when they leave ' off " coffee , and take
Postum.
It must also be added that the poison
of the coffee does not affect the heart In
some patients, but shows Its work in the
stomach and bowels with one, perhaps in
the eyes with another, and kidneys with
another, and general nervous prostration
with another.
It is never possible to tell just where
the result of the poisoned nerve centers
will show forth. There is biit one way
to surely cure such cases and that is by
insisting upon leaving' ' off . coffee and
using Postum in Its place.V Postum 'con-
tains the elements for rebuilding the
nerve cells and brain. Albumen is fur-

coming from San Jose, on which were
San Franciscans who had been picnicking
in Agricultural Park in this city. As the
trains 'were ; passing a rock . crashed
through the window where Miss Steffani
was sitting and struck her on the head.
The rock is supposed to have beenthrown
by one of the passengers on the excursion"
train. Miss Steffani was severely in
jured and for months her life was de
spaired of. .She in time improved, but the
shock caused by.-, the ; accident and the

The chessmen of the institute -had a
ticket of their own in the field, the fa
vorite candidate being Edward A. T. Gal
lagher. Some time ago the directors de
prived the chessmen of their room and
c-onverted It into an apartment in whicli
lectures are now given. In lieu of their
' comfortable quarters the chessmen v/ere
given the old reading room, which is small
and not especially well lighted. A tre
mendous uproar was raised, but the di
rectors were obdurate, and when the time
for nominating a ticket arrived the chess
men placed a ticket in the field. Since
that time, however, a compromise of
some sort was effected with the dissatis
fied, chessmen, the result being a general
stampede to the present directors, all of
whom were candidates. Early in the day
Gallagher admitted the defeat of the
chessmen's ticket-
The younger element â¢ of the " institute
<iidates asserted that the property in ques
tion is too valuable to sell at this time
now that it lies within the district of the
city which is improving more rapidly

tained with certainty which candidates
represented this element, but it was gen
erally punposed that the ticket naming
Henry M. Black, Ernest Brand, "William

sentative of the "hold-on-to-all-we've

Healy Makes Strong Fight.
Director P. J. Healy, who, because of

un<3, although he did not appear at tJio
polls before closing time, he received a
heavy vote. Healy sent a circular to eacn
member," In which he severely analgned
the present administration and hinted
that the lamentable experience of the
Uashaway Association would be repeated
if the members did not stir themselves
and elect as directors men who had the
interests of the institute really at heart.
Healy's open rupture with the board sev
* ral years- ago made him a conspicuous
JiSTire at the election last year, and.- al
though stupendous eilorts were made in
all quarters to secure his defeat, he wjs
vindicated by receiving a handsome ma
jority. It was because of this result last
year that pains w*re taken to defeat him.

warning circular evidently had weight
with the rank and file of the member
ship, as his vote testified.
Another faction represented on the
ticket was that which is violentlv op
posed to the sale of the Mechanics' Pa
vilion for the Carnegie library site as well
as the Folsom-street lot. These can-
unusual number of candidates contesting
for the honor, of. devoting their time and
energies to library affairs during the next
twelve months is regarded as remarkab.e.
The rivalry was sharp, and no efforts were
ppared'by the various candidates to cap
ture every available vote. It* was: ah o.
easion of which the woman with a vote
did net. fail to avail . herself , . The.r<c : u.t
Â¦was that fully one-quarter of the 7S2 votes
cast between 11 a. m. and 9 ~p. m., when
the polls closed, were deposited by women
members of the institute. The friends of
the various candidates approached every
voter'as lie or ehe came t<* vote and urged
the claims of their favorites to the favor
tble consideration of the member. So in
sistent did these become early in the day
that 'Â¦ an order was issued prohibiting
electioneering in the room in which th<?
i>s!iot;ng was done. . . -. â¢
What was regarded as the ' winning
ticket throughout the day was that of thrt
present directors, . headed by Samuel C.
Irving. Gtorge Beanston, L. R. Mead, R.
J. TausEig, tieorge II. Wallis and J. K.
Coegrave. The supporters of this ticket
distributed circulars announcing that the
affairs of the institute had progressed
wonderfully under the management of the
present board, and that for the first time
in the history of the institute a policy of
progress had been adopted. The assertion
vras made that the library was se;f-sup
potring, and as a result the directors were
entitle a to the suffrage of every member
Tvho had the welfare of the institute at
heart.
The liveliest election in the h/etory of
the Mechanics' Institute was held yester
day. I hirty-one candidates, including the
nominees of three distinct parties or fac
tions, not to. mention a dozen or. more in
dependent candidates, who permitted th<3
use cf their names, "in the interests of
ultiniate harmony," were in the field. ;j
When it is known that only seven of
these, candidates were to be elected, th<j

W., WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â What Is
known ; as the Appalachian region is. the
great , mountain district^ extending: from
1 v/estern .New Â¦ York' on the north about
*900 miles southwesterly into Alabama; â¢
This region is the seat of the greatest
I mineral* industries of the country. 'either
in the production of trie raw materials or
in their manufacture Y. into -some higher
form " of finished product.. . It embraces
in whole or in part the : States of New
York, Pennsylvania, I /West Virginia,
southeastern J; Ohio, ,. ( Virginia, ,- eastern
Â¦ Kentucky, Tenneessee, -vyestern Georgia,
North Carolina and! Alabama.. .... .,.
; Coaland iron are j the basis of. our, in
iciustrial wealth, and the story. of their
production' and, manufacture In this sec
tion forms a most interesting part of the
"Mineral. Resources of the United States,
1KV-. recently published by the United
States Geological Survey. A briefreview
shows that this region furnished over
C.000,000 long. tons. of Iron ore of the total
of a little over 27,500,000 tons for the whole
muntry- The Lake Superior region in
Michigan, -. Minnesota and '"Wisconsin
furnished about 20,500,000 -tons, leaving
something like 1.000,000 " tons for all the
rest of the country. But when one fol
lows this: iron rone step farther to its
conversion into pig iron, we find that the
Appalachian region,' with Pennsylvania
far in the lead, produced In round num
bers about 9.500,000 long tons of the total
output of 13,789,242 tons; ana if we fol
low this pig iron a step or. two further
Â¦we -find that' this -same region produced,
in-round 'numbers,, about â¢ 4,500,000 ' long
tbns "of the total of 6,684.770 tons of Bes
seme'r; steel ingots; about 2,850,000 long
tons. Of a ..total -'of 3,338,135 tons of open
hearth steel, more than three .fifths of
the: total of 2,361,921 long tons of Besse
; mer -steel rails, and about: two^thirda. of
all the .wire .nails produced in: 1900.-:. ..
The explanation -, of '-this . , disproportion
of manufactures is \ readily seen in the
production by: Pennsylvania of all" but
: about 100,000 short tons Â¦ of the output>of
57,466,319 .tons of anthracite coal: -in the
irrcductlon by '-this .region of a little over
; 67 per cent v of the total output of "bitu

WHEAT FREIGHTS â For the general run
of carriers 25s remains -the average rate, usual
European options. The market is weak.' .The
chartered wheat fleet in port has a registered
tonnage of 35,000, against 32,665 tons on. the
same date last year; disengaged, 37,000 tons,
against 2914; on the way to this port. 201,550
;tons, against 143,000. _,.
WHEATâ All foreign futures were lower,
and the European markets were quiet. Brad
street's gave a decrease of 2,041,000 bushels
In the world's visible supply, against a de
crease of 3,582,000 bushels last year.
News was scarce yesterday, the wires being
demoralized from Chicago to California. Chi
cago opened rather firmer, but there was some
further selling of long wheat. Otherwise there
was nothing new.
There was less disturbance in values yester
day, but the market was weak - on call and
lower on the spot.

"W.. "WASHINGTON. Feb. 25.â Because
gold and silver are Â«3ed for measuring as
money tlie values of other national pro
ducts, people are prone to consider their
production as perhaps the most important
of the mineral outputs of our country- In
a certain sense thl3 Is true. But a com
parison of some of our mineral industries
as set forth by the '.United States Geologi
cal Survey-in the -"Mineral Resources of
the United States, 1900," shows horr small
a part, relatively, the two precious inetala
play in adding to our national wealth,
j Round numbers alone being used for
convenience sake, it Is found that the gold
product was worth $79,000,000, and that the
commercial value of. the silver product
was about .$36,000,000. though the coining
value was $74,000,000. As metals, then, tho
Sold and silver were worth $115,000,000; aÂ»
money,' they were worth $133,tW),0OO.
Now the copper produced in 19C0 wa3
valued at $98,0W.0OO. though the price de
creased a cent and a half a pound as com
pared with 1839: the lead was valued at
over $23,000,000, though the condition of the
Industry was not good; zinc was produced
to the value of over $10,000,000, though it
declined 28 per cent in value as compared
withlS99. The copper, lead and zinc pro
ducts were worth more as metals, by iltf.
000,000, than our gold and silver, as metal*,
in 1900. ... â¢ â¢ â¢ . Â¦ . ' -'.IVJ.*;
â¢ Again the combfned values of the pro
duction of tibrasive materials, such as
grindstones, garnets, and so on; of chem
ical materials, such as gypsum, phosphate
rock, and others; of pigments, such as
metallic paint, white lead, and so on; and
of the miscellaneous metallic products,
the whole aggregate amounting to about
$52,000,000. show 'that they were worth less,
aa metals or metallic products, than tho
gold by about $27,000,000, and more thaa
the silver, as a metal, by $16,000,000.
. Further, tbe comparison of gold and sil
ver with the structural materials pro
ducedâthat is, with $43;000,000 of buildlns
Ktone, $96,000,000 worth of clay products
and $13,000,000 of cements;. $157,000,000 in all
âshows that the structural materials ex
ceeded the gold and sjiiver in value by
$42,000,000. if the commercial value of sil
ver Is taken,. and by $4,000,000. even if sil
ver is taken at its coining value of 571,
000,000.
Applied now to "the great metallic basis
of our civilization, iron and its products,
the comparison becomes still more strik
ing." Iron ore was produced to within less
than $9,000,000 of thefvalue of the gold; and
pig iron was produced to a value ot nearly
$107,000,000 in excess of the coining value of
both gold and silver combined. But tho
comparison of the gold and silver output
with, the output of the mineral fuels, coal.
petroleum and natural gas, Is the most
striking of all, for tbe combined gold and
silver value is execeeded by the huge sum
of $253,000,000, or $406,000,000 as against
$153,000,000. '
These comparisons are the more inter
esting in view of the statements of the
Director of the "Mint that "two-thirds of
the output of silver In the United States,
is obtained- as a by-product of mines
which -would be operated no matter what
the price of silver might be," and that in
the' Cripple. Creek district the "reserves
(of gold) m sight are enormous."
Another popular prepossession that re
ceives scant courtesy at the hands of thÂ«
report is in regard to tin. Besides thÂ«
terse statement under the tabular sum
mary, "Tinâ Quantityâ None," tin is only
mentioned twice in the volume, once un
der the iron and steel statistics.- when the
production of tin plates and terne plates
to the amount of 202,665 long tons is noted,
and again a brief description Is given of
the "Occurrence of Stream Tin in the
York Region. Alaska." the York region ly
ing west of Cape Nome. "We produced np>
tin ' in this country in 1900.
DAWSON SHOWS MARKED
IMPROVEMENT IN MORALS
Crusade Against Gambling and Vica
in Yukon Capital Has
Good Effect.
TACOMA, Feb. .25.â Dawson advices
state there has been a decided improve
ment in the moral character of the town
and its inhabitants within the past few
months. This improvement is due in a
large measure to the stringent regulations
as to public gambling and other vices
that have been -enforced by the authori
ties. Some months ago the edict went
forth that the laws against gambling
would be more rigidly enforced and fol
lowing the announcement a number of
residents who were known to be profes
sional . gamblers and who had no visible
means of support were warned that their
presence in the country was no longer de
sired. .There was a large movement of
the "blue ticftet men" toward the outside,
and since that time the . prevalence of
crime and' vice in Dawson has shown Â¦ a
decided slump. .
Early this month another order was is
sued to the police authorities to proceed
in the suppression of the "percentage"
system. The officers were instructed to
arrest and prosecute all who earned. their
living by frequenting places whe.re liquors
are sold and inducing 'Â¦ men they meet
there to purchase drinks. "Box rustling"
is thus abolished. Â¦ Â¦.- Â¦Â¦* -.
The hegira of several hundred miners to
Koyokuk and 'Forty .Mile has been fol
lowed by a stampede thither of numerous
members of the sporting element.

City Engineer Grunsky then explained
aC length his report on the cost of , a
municipal gas plant which was filed at
the morning session. The following reso
lution was adopted and the investigation
was declared closed: "
Chief Engineer E. Ci Jones of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company was
recalled, at the night session to give tes
timony regarding the electrical branch of
the corporation. Jones said the cost of
direct current in 1901 was 4 1-10 cents per
kilowatt ."'hour;' alternating current
6 6-10 cents and constant current 8 cents.
The maximum amount received for elo
trie lighting is 11 cents per kilowatt
hour from a few consumers. The aver
age amount received Is 5.13 cents. ,- In
the- downtown- districts, where there is
competition, 4 cent3 is charged, which is
less than the cost of direct current.
Cost of Electric . Current.
i E. J. Martin of the Central Light and
Power Comoany said the average cost
per kilowatt hour was .0257c; the average
receipts Â». 04G5c; the maximum rate charged
was .07c and the minimum rate. .0325c.
Martin thought in the course of time
there would be a combination of â¢ all
the companies, when the maximum rate
v/ould be charged. The cost of. the plant
was 1238,000, and the profit made last year
was Â§40,000. ,
â¢ T/. R. Â¦ Summerhayes, the manager ,of
the Mutual Electric Light Company,- was
questioned as to the cost of producing
light and the-rate received. He said. the
cost of production per kilowatt' hour was
.0377c. and the aver&ge receipts were
.04047c; the .average, loss on distribu
tion was 10 per cent; the maximum rate
charged was 8 cents, and the lowest .0291,
to the State, on account of competition.
He said the company had made about 2
per. cent on the cost of the plant. . The
company has a capacity of 1675 kilowatts,
1400 being the most ever produced.
Other Companies Give Figures.
Continuing. Hunt said that rates varied
in. different sections and for variou3 rea
sons. For- instance, the company regard
ed a contract made with the Rlsdon Iron
Works at 3 cents as more profitable than
some made with other concerns at a
higher, rate. He, said that the Rlsdon
company had acapacity of 5000 kilowatts,
and had run up to 4900, and at present 1500
kilowatts additional capacity was being
Installed. He said the -capitalization of
the company was $10,CO0,000, and the cost
of the plant so far had been J2,606,S67.
