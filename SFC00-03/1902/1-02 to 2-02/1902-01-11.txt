If Castro is defeated anarchy. It is
feared, will prevail' for a time. American
interests in Venezuela are extensive and
they must have protection. Th Indiana
will 'be able to reach La Guayra In a few
hours and can land a force sufficient to
proceed to Caracas and protect the Amer

Official denial is given to reports that
the purpose to assemble American men
of-war in Venezuelan waters has any
connection with the proposed demonstra
tion of Germany and the reported inten
tion of France to carry out a programme
similar to that .of the Berlin government.
Germany Is considerately awaiting the
outcome of ' the revolution In Venezuela,
as she promised the authorities here aha
would do." It is confidently expected by
the administration that if General Mato3
succeeds Castro as - President It will ba
able to use its influence to effect an ami
cable adjustment of the various questions
pending between Venezuela and the Euro
pean states.
â No comprehensive advices concernis*

he will sail for Guantanarno, touching en

pared to sail the moment he is ordered to
do so. ,
British. German and French vessels arÂ»
also gathering in the vicinity of Vene

Guayra in case of trouble. Because the
administration deems it advisable that the
senior officer present shall be an Ameri

son shall be with his flagship at the sea
port of Caracas when conditions require.
â¢A formidable naval representation will
then occur at La Guayra. It will consist

MINERS' THEILLING DBOP
DOWN INCLINED SHAFT
the accused men were entitled to chal
lenge the jury, in view of the fact that the r '
jury Jiad been working on this case for
many ,inonths and J that during .that time
the minds of the members became infiu*
enced against the suspects. The discus
sion continued for sereral hours this
afternoon, both sides resorting to reading
from the Code.
The defense claimed that a member of
the jury had not power to make a per
sonal investigation and report the facts
as hÂ« found them to his fellow jurors;
that such an act disqualified the entire
jury, and that if a member of the jury
had reported certain facts to his fellow
jurors he had no place in the investiga
tion which might follow.
Thâ¬: prosecution argued that the men
now in custody had r.o standing in court
for the reason that no charges had been
preferred against them: that they were
simply being held on a warrant issued
by Judge E. M. Cherry and on a com
mitment issued by Judge Harrington in
his denial of the habeas corpus petition of
Brown; that not until charges had been"
preferred could the defense challenge the
jury.
Aeslstant Attorney General Post said
that the jury had been organized many
'months ago and that if it had formed
- opinions as to the culpability of certain
persons it was only natural. But had
opinions been expressed by members of
the jury before the formation of that
body the right to challenge could hardly
be denied.
The prosecution argued that the defense
presumed' greatly in assuming that in
dictments were to be returned against any
of those In custody. The Grand Jury was
not bound by an act of any magistrate,
and the accused must have been held to
answer at the time the Grand Jury was
sworn in before he could question quali
fications of an Individual juror; In short,
before a person had a standing in court
he must get into court.
Jury -ras based on the grounds that sev
eral members had expressed opinions
aversei to the prisoners and that the
Grand Jury was not a competent body by
reason of these alleged statements. The
challenge was pointed particularly at four
men, viz: Heard, Brown, Cannon and
Kistler, foreman.
In their opening address, counsel for the
defense Bald they were ready to prove
that Heard was a party to the prosecu
tion; that be had acted the part of de
tectivu for the prosecution and that he
had aided the prosecution materially in
obtaining the confession of John Hutton
and hid promised Hutton immunity from
punishment. Counsel also declared that
Heard had been promised financial reward
for his-services.
Juror Brown was accused of being a
resident of Oregon and not eligible to
serve on the Modoc County Grand Jury.
He was quoted as having said that he
would indict the accused men under .the
circumstances, whether the testimony
warranted it or not. . /Â¦Â¦?%

MEXICO CITY, Jan. 10.âIt is believed
that the arbitration difficulty in the Pan-
American conference has>flnally been dls
'poscd of, '.though. it'- is uncertain how the
Chileans wlir act: ,â¢"".
The solution' is tbH>e found In the sup
pression of the final protocol, for which
purpose a modification of the rules of the
conference will be. necessary. For this
purpose a two-thirds vote will be needed,
but it is already practically assured.
The suppression of the final protocol is
; the only concession that will* be made to
the Chileans. - Ita significance is simply
that the treaties approved by the conter
ence will only bear the signatures of the
delegations '-who . adopt 'them: The final
protocol .will, bear the signatures of all
iho delegations without exception. and It
will be a resume 6(. all the treaties con
cluded'by the conference, Including that
, of -compulsory arbitration, signed by ten
delegations. ~ Therefore, as the Chileans
would have had to sign the final protocol
j with' the,^ other - delegations, they would
-have, been placed in; the position. of indi
rectly sanctioning. the. plan of compulsory
arbitration, v - â¢ :' ; \ â¢
. -Now," however,- if the' final protocol la
abolished this difficulty will be overcome,
and it Is 'held that the Chileans will be
evincing â¢ excessive, sensitiveness if they
persist . in withdrawing. One of them,
when asked to-night what they would. do
if the compulsory, plan went to the con
ference in the form, explained in the fore
going, said that his delegation would act
according â¢ to circumstances- and instruc
tions. He denied that they had ever

In order to add to the formality of-tiia

Special Dispatch to The Call.
"Scientific and Logical.",
Crumpacher of Indiana favored the pas
sage of the bill, which, he argued, would
be the first step toward putting the cen
sus upon a scientific and logical basis.
Maddcx of Georgia opposed in toto the
plan of a. permanent Census . Bureau.
Hemenway of Illinois also opposed the
bill. Sims of Tennessee said he would
propose an amendment to place the em
ployes of the office under the civil service
law. Bingham of Pennsylvania supported
the bill. After some further discussion
by Gillet of Massachusetts, Fleming of
Georgia, Sulzer of New York and WIK
liams of Illinois, Hopkins closed the gen
eral debate with an earnest plea In favor
of the passage of the bill. â¢.
The bill was then opened to amendment
and Hemenway of Indiana â¢ offered an
amendment to provide that persons now
employed in the Census Bureau, not in
cluding janitors.: shall be eligible to ap
pointment- in other departments without
examination, or certification by the Civil
Service Commission upon the recommend
ation of such department.
Mann ' of- Illinois opposed, the .amend
ment because it placed no time limit
upon the. eligibility of employes." The
Hemenway^ amendment was adopted
without division.
Burkett then moved that the bill be
reported to the House with the recom
mendation that it be recommitted, -with
instructions to reoort back . as "a substi
tute a bill providing for detailed'organ
ization of a permanent Census Bureau
and with a provision therein to place the
present employes of the bureau withtn
the -classified service. : Hopkins attempted
to secure,. thÂ« ayes and noes on the.mo
tion to recommit, but only thlrtv-eigbt
member?;' seconded his demandâ not a suf
ficient jiiimber. The motion to recommit
wÂ«e carried.; - . . â¢:. '. â . â¢.,
Bromwell of Ohio secured unanimous
consent and the House passed the bill to 1
rive the widow of the late President Mc-
Ktnley the franki"Â«r privilege during the
remainder of her life.
Then at 4:40 p. m. the House adjourned
until Monday.
Condition of the Clerks.
In reply to questions Hopkins said that
;;48U clerks haa been employed in the bu
reau, 2700 being still employed. If the
pending- bill passed, he said, the force
-vould be reduced this year to 800; next
year to 750; in 1905 to 2*0, and thereafter
until 1910 to 200. He was besieged by mem
bers who wanted to know the status of
the present clerks In the event of the pas
â¢sage of the bill. He said that if the bill
passed it was hoped the other depart
ments-could absorb the present temporary
clerks. They could then be placed under
the protection of the civil service and
transferred to other departments. If the
bill were promptly passed the temporary
clerks by executive order could be made
eligible for transfer.
Several members, among them Mann of
Illinois and Corliss of Michigan, sug
gested that the bill be amendea to pro
vide that the clerks be eligible for trans
fer.
Grosvenor. of Ohio asked if It would not
be wise to authorize the President to ex
tend the civil service law over the sur
plus clerks. Hopkins replied that the sub
ject had been canvassed by the House and
â¢Senate committees and it had been
thought such action would not be expedi
ent.
Burkett of Nebraska opposed the bill,
contending that it was improper and in
opportune and asserting that the course
of the . debate to-day demonstrated tnat
the proposed legislation had not been well
considered. He declared that the only
persons who had agitated the subject of
er permanent census had been the super
intendents of the past censuses and oth
ers directly interested. He pointed out
that a salary of $7500 was voted to the
Director of the Census on the ground of
the temporary character of the employ
ment and the great responsibility. This
bill proposed to continue this, salary. He
declared that the experts whose serv
ices it was found necessary to retain had
been detailed from the various depart
ments. Burkett said there was nothing
in the bill to keep the census clerks In
office. It was designed to keep only the
chiefs of division and higher officers in
their present positions. He thought the
bill should be recommitted.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10.â The House
E]>ent tho day considering the Hopkins
bill to create a permanent census bureau.
"While the general sentiment was in favor
of a permanent bureau, there was strong
opposition to the bill as drawn on the
ground that it was not well matured.
There also was an overwhelming demand
for a provision to place the present em
ployes of the Census Bureau under the
protection of the civil service law, and the
bill finally was recommitted T/ith instruc
tions to report back a bill containing a
plan for a detailed organization of a per
manent census bureau, to Include also a.
provision to place the present employes
under the civil service.
At the opening of, the session Barney
reported the pension bill and gave notice
t tt&t he woula call It up on Monday atter
the disposal of District of Columbia busi
ness. - .
On motion of Hopkins of Illinois the
House then went into committee of the
whole and took up the consideration of
the bill to create a permanent census ot
t.ce. Hopkins, in support of the bill, ex
plained that the suDject of establishing
a, permanent bureau had been agitated for
many years. General Francis A. Walker,
superintendent of the ninth and tenth
tensuses. and Porter, superintendent of
the feleventh census, as well as the pres
ent director, united in strongly recom
mending it on the ground that it would
not only decrease the cost, but would In
crease the value of the results.
The manufacture of the cable was now
proceeding, he stated, at the rate of 240
miles per month and this rate would be Â¦
increased to 640 miles per month. He gave
the cost of the project as between $10,-
COO.000 and $12,000,000.
The cross-questioning by Chairman Hep
burn and Messrs. Corliss and Mann tended
-to develop the question whether or not ,
the company, by having an exclusive
field, would maintain high rates. Ward
gave the expected rate to Manila at $1
and Honolulu 35 cents to 50 cents a word.
The hearing will continue to-morrow. ,
. The hearing to-day was devoted to an
explanation by George G. ' Ward, vice
president of the Commercial Pacific Cable
Company, of the plans of that company.
He stated that terms had been made for
the -manufacturing: and laying of a cable
to Honolulu by November 1 next and the
company intended to extend the cable to
Manila within two years from next No
vember.
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 10.â The Hous*

"Now I want to know," said Captain
Bolles, "how many minutes after you
saw the green light did the vessels col

Johnson became frightened and lamely
admitted that about five minutes had
passed.
"Are you sure you reported the green
light to the mate?"
"I sang out to him as loud as I could."
"Did you call more than once?"
"No, s!r."
"Did you get an answer?"

He' turned to the witness and in an angry
tone said:
"If you went off to report the 'white
light; why didn't you go to the bridge the
second time and report the green one?
You as a seaman ought to know it was
more dangerous."
"Well,- 1 sang out," doggedly replied the
witness. "I thought I did my duty."
"Well, you're not sure he heard you?"
"No, I am not exactly sure."
"Was the quartermaster on the look
out?" ' Jj er*%cds i njwjiijMMiM
"No, sir; he went below."
Captain Hall interrupted to say that the
lookout was instructed to report " person
ally to the bridge if he saw a light and
not to sing out. The witness admitted he
knew this rule. ' Â¦ ,
The witness Bald he left the steamer in
No. 8 boat, which was in charge of Boat
swain Ajec Holmes. He said he heard
the captain's orders telling them to go to
the stern of the boat and take off other
passengers, but owing to the boat having
but an oar and a half they were unable
to do so. Â»- â¢ * . -
Joseph W. x Ettershank, a 19-year-old
boy, who waa. quartermaster on the Wal
la Walla and in charge of the wheel at
the time of the disaster, was then ex
amined. He said he had been at sea one
year, and of that time had been quarter
master for seven months. His testimony
developed the fa^t that he had been given
orders to "hard a port" and he . had
obeyed them.
J. Albert Reed, first assistant engineer,
was unable to attend and his affidavit was
read. According to his statement, the
collision occurred at^4:15 o'clock. This is
in direct contradiction of the time given
by the officers of the Walla -Walla. The
latter. claim that the clock in. the engine
room was fifteen minutes fast. Reed
swears that he set his clock by. the time

saw the-light,' and on returning I saw a

"What, did you do when you saw the
green . light?" â¢- â¢Â¦* : ...

He testified .that he was the regular
lookout â¢ and had Â¦ the watch -from 4 to A
o'clock; that he came on duty at 4 o'clock
and that the ; weather was disagreeable.'
He said he had been going to sea for the
past . two years and had been employed
as lookout' on the Walla Walla for the
past three 1 ' months." He stated he could
see well that moraine and was able to
distinguish the Cape Mendocino light.
After looking at the green and red Hght3
of the Walla Walla, he said" he took up
his station amidships and then saw a light
on the port'bow. :Â¦ â¢
"How long was that after you went on
the lookout?" asked Mr. Bolles.
The chief witness of the day was Eph
ram Johnaon, the seaman who was on
the lookout on the morning of the colli
sion. Captain Bulger had to go at him
"rough shod" to get. him to testify as to
what he knew. The : witness was afraid
to speak. : He feared he might be blamed
for negligence.
Johnson Was Lookout.
Second" Officer Frederick Lupp was the
next witness examined. The follopving
statement submitted to the inspectors was
read: . .....
'/My watch was from 12 midnight to .1
a. m., and after being relieved by the
third offier, Mr. Hughes; at 4 a. m., I re
ported off to Captain Hall./ The captain
then got up and had a look around.
"The quartermaster ha /ing neglected to
compare the ' after compass, I sent, him
.aft to do so before going below.. I then
went 'below and returned to the bridge it
4:30. L went into the charthouse to write
up the log and while so engaged I heard
the lookout .report a light on the port
bow. Almost the same instant I heat d
the third officer give orders to port helm
and then sing out, 'hard. a-port !' Not
hearing the quartermaster answer him, I
repeated the order to him. I looked for
the cause of -the- trouble- and saw -a flan*,
light on. the port side and almost the
same instant Â¦ the .bowsprit Vof the " ship
came over our bridge and struck the Wal
la -Walla." ,: ; :". Â¦ -â¢-: .. â¢
The witness corroborated the captain as
to calling him. at 4 o'clock and told how
he had changed the course of the vessel
and took bearings oft the Mendocino light.
The witness testified to the facts that ap
peared In his statement.
"Was the third officer Injured?", he was
asked. :Â¦'-, , Â¦.
"No.' sir. He was not Injured, because
he spoke to me afterward and said the
bark had. no lights out," Lupp replied.
He stated that Hughes was standing
right behind him in the charthouse when
the lookout notified him that there -was
a light on I the port side. Mr. Lupp told
how easy it. was for Hughes to reach the
quartermaster from where he was stand
ing, but the inspectors were a little du
bious. ' Â»i|*~Mfltll W 'Hw Wi WJiraft ifr>

I told Mr. Hughes to keep a . sharp

At this moment Inspector Bulger an
nounced that Second Officer Lupp, who
was listening to the testimony, had no
right to be' present. Captain Bolles dis
agreed with his colleague. * Lupp came to
the front and said if they wished to have
him wait outside he would do so. As hu
was on trial; he was "permitted to remain
Continuing; Captain Hall said: "I was
in my cabin just before the accident.
When I Â¦. heard the cry 'hard a-port!' I
sprang out of my. room just as the ves
sels collided. I then rushed to the bridge
and found the second and third officers
there. They both said, 'They showed no
lights, captain.' "â¢
The witness then told what he had done
to save the lives of his passengers, all of
which has been narrated before. . -
asked Captain Bolles. -
'.'There was a heavy sea running and It
was dark and cloudy," , he replied.
"How came you to get up at 4 o'clock?"
'I always did so when the weather was
southeast. , The second officer called me.
I was on' deck five" or ten minutes."

man at the wheel from the charthouse?"
"Through a scuttle."

to him by Captain Bolles. "At the time

"Henry Burget, a carpenter on the Max,
was the next witness. He swore that
the lookout on the Walla Walla was
asleep, but later modified his statement
by Haying he saw a shadow of a man
who appeared to be leaning against the
railing and was suddenly awakened by
the shock.
Says Lookout Was Asleep.
"I was very much scared," replied Lelr.
"I thought it would. I had several ex
periences of this kind and was -much
afraid the ship would go down."
"Did the steamer strike the ship or
the shiji the steamer?" he was asked.
"The Walla Walla struck the Max," re
plied Leir.
"After the ships separated, did you sec
the lights on the steamer?" Captain Hall
inquired.
"Yes, sir. The lights were burning
about twenty minutes afterward."
"How much oil does your lamps hold?"
asked Second Officer Lupp.
"A dipperful," was the reply.
"How far was the steamer off the ship
Â¦when you first saw it?" Captain Hall in
terrograted.
"It tcok her twenty minutes to come
en top of us," was the answer.
"After the collision I heard the steam
er whistle, but not before," he answered.
"Did you see any one on the steamer
after the accident?"
"Yes. sir. After the accident I- saw a
Btout man and woman come out of the
cabin half dressed."
The witness Â«tate<i that the steamer's
red iight was smashed when the vessels
struck each other. He said he was in the
ha-bit of removing the lights at 7:30 In
the morning. He could not tell, however,
at what hour he removed them that
morning. He swore all the lamps on the
Max excepting the .red light were burning:
brightly after the collision; that they
burned forty-eight hours without being
replenished.
"Did you think the Max was going to
fcink?" ~he inspector asked.
"I was in the center of the deck oa
watch at the time of the collision. As
soon as the lookout gave warning that
the steamer was in sight I looked and
saw a light on her masthead. I nevt*
saw a green light. When I saw the light
on the steamer I went on the forecastle
and watched her approach. When the
collision took place 1 was on the star
board side. Wnen I observed the steam
er the first time she was about 45 min
utes on the starboard side. After the col
lision the steamer turned and camo
alongside. I am 49 years old and have
been at sea thirty-eight years. The Max
was going at the rate of four or five
miles an hour at the time. I cannot say
exactly. As soon as the boats came to
gether a. torch was lit."
"Did you hear any noise from the
steamer?" the witness was asked.
Eugene Leir, a sailor, who was in
charge of the lamps on the French bark,
was the first witness called. He testified
that he put the lights out at 5 o'clock the
night before the collision and visited
them every half hour to see If they were
burning brightly. In the morning after
seeing t.'ae steamer he again went for
ward ajQ.J saw that the lights were burn
ing. He said he has acted as lookout and
has done his "trick" at the wheel. The
witness istated he was very careful when
on the lookout because he had been in
three other accidents. Continuing, ' he
said: -'- p
Says Lights Burned.
Ephram Johnson, a sailor, was the
lookout. It was his duty to report to
the officer of the deck whenever he saw
a light in the path of the ship. He tes
tified he left his post to report that there
â¢was a white light off the port bow of
the speeding steamer, but when he saw
the green light he simply shouted out the
fact. HÂ«j admits that he does not know
whether his shout was heard.
Captain Holies, one of the Inspectors
conducting the examination, askea John
son why he did not report the green light
as he reported the wliite one. The wit
ness replied he thought. he .dad done his
duty by singing- out.
Captain Hall gave testimony denying
the assertion that the lights of the Max
were burning after tne collision. Henry
Burget, a carpenter on the Max, swore
that the lookout on the Walla Walla was
asleep, but when interrogated was unable
to give substantial proof of his statement.
Hughes, who was lost In the
ocean disaster, was In charge of the ship
at the time of the collision. .

Does Not disappoint.
The New Discovery for Catarrh Seems to
Possess Remarkable Merit.
A nÂ«w catarrh cure has recently ap-
pearet* which so far as tested has been
remarkably successful in curing all forma
of catarrh, whether in the head, throat,
bronchial tubes or in stomach and liver. .
.The remedy is in tablet form, pleasant
and convenient to take, and no sp*c!al
secrecy Is maintained . as to what It con-
tains, the tablet being a scientific com-
bination of Blood root. Red gum and sim-
ilar valuable and harmless antiseptics.
The safe and effective catarrh cure may
be found at any drug store under the
name of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets.
.- .Whether the catarrh Is located In the
nose, throat, bronchial - tabes or stomacc. ,
the tablets seem to act with equal sue- "
cess, removing the stuffy feeling In hea-l
and nose, clearing the mucous membrane
of throat and trachea from catarrhal se-
cretions, which cause the tickling, cough-
ing, hawking and gagging so annoying to
every catarrh sufferer.
. Nasal catarrh generally leads to ulcera-
tion, in some cases to such an extent a*
to destroy the nose entirely and in man-/
old cases of catarrh the bones of the head
become diseased. .Nasal . catarrh grad-
ually extends .to the throat and bronchial
tubes and very " often to the stomach ,
causing' that- very, obstinate trouble, ca-
tarrh of the stomach.
Catarrh is a systemic poison, inherent
In the blood, and local washes, douches,
salves, inhaler3 and sprays can- have no
effect on the real cause of the disease. '
An internal remedy which acts upon the
blood is the only rational treatment and
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets is the safest of
all internal remedies, as well aa the most-
convenient and satisfactory from a med-
ical standpoint. -. â¢
Dr. Â¦ Eaton recently stated that he had
successfully used Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets in old chronic cases,, even where ui-
ceration- had extended so far as to de-
stroy the septum of the nose. He says:
"I am pleasantly surprised almost every
day by. the excellent results from Stuart's
Catarrh' Tablets. It Is remarkable hovv
effectually they remove the excessive se-
cretion, and bring about a healthy con-
dition of the mucous membranes of the
nose, throat and stomacn." - - Â¦
All druggists sell complete treatment oJ
the Tablets at 50 cents and a little booh
giving . the symptoms and causes of the
various forms of catarrh will be mailed
free by addressing F. A. Stuart Co., Ma-.

The ladles of the California Tennis Club
are planning a. mixed doubles to be held
on some L . Wednesday. Many of the fair
sex devote the mornings to tennis, and
an event of this kind would attract a
large entry. Among those. who will take
part are the Misses Salisbury, Farns
worth. Whitney. Smith, Hunter,. Mecart
ney, Sherwood, Mrs. Du Reynier and Mrs
Kincaid. â¢
A series of round robin matches be
tween members of the . first class - In the
California Clubls being: talked of. This
would settle the question of supremacy
finally and a ranking of the best players
in the city could be made. . The men who
would be eligible to play are: W. B. Col
lier, H. W. Crowell, S. H. Adams, Merle
Johnson, Drummond â¢- MacGavIn, Fred
Brown and Grant Smith. The plan is for
each man to .play two matches every
Sunday, the man with the largest number
of victories to rank first, and so on down
the line. '
During the past month the enthusiasm
of the local players seems to have been
felt across the bay, where there is a gen
eral revival of tennis. This is especially
noticeable In Alameda. The Alameda and
Bellevue Tennis clubs are again in exist
ence and -are made up of the best players
In the county. Reuben Hunt is the cham
pion of the former, while Percy Murdock
is the best player in the Bellevue Club.
Hunt has won the championship of Ala
meda County for several years, but this
year Percy Murdock downed the cham
pion in clever fashion. Murdock plays a
graceful game, and three or four years
ago was considered promising.
' The finals of, the class singles tourna
ment commenced on New Year's in Ala
meda-were played yesterday. â¢ The con
testants were Percy Murdock, winner of
class A. and Hamilton Murdock, the first
class winner. The latter received odds, of
"fifteen," and after a close struggle was
beaten , by his brother in straight sets.
The score in Percy's favor was 6 â 4, 8â 0,
Harold Crowell is steadily improving
and â¢ caused a genuine surprise last Sun
day by beating his partner, W. B. Collier,
four straight sets and one of them 6-â 0.
The loser has been playing better tennis
than he ever played and has always
beaten Crowell handily. When the latter
defeated him last Sunday Collier was
somewhat surprised.
The past season has been a successful
one and has brought about several im
portant changes. Several of the ex-cham
pions, of the coast, who ten years ago
were invincible, have again taken up their
rackets and by practice are regaining
their former skill. Both Will Taylor and
Joe Tobln have impressed the present
generation of players favorably. If any
held the opinion that these men were not
good players they changed It when they
saw tbe former experts on the courts.
This coast is the only part of the
United States In which tennis can be
played all the year through and in which
more playing Is done In winter than at
any other time. . Â¦>
The New Year's tournament completed
last Sunday brought to a close the winter
season on the tennis courts. .The open
ing event of the spring season will be an
open class singles tournament on .Wash

sold his schooner yacht, will retire from
office. It is expected the nomination will
be offered Vice Commodore R. S. Bridg
man, owner cf the slocp Thetis. Mr.
Rridgman resides in Sausallto, and is an
enthusiastic yachtsman. The nomination
icr vice commodore may be ottered to A.
C Lee of the sloop Surprise.'. He held the
same office in -the, California Yacht Club
in 1899. W. M. Edgell has proved himself
so active and efficient a secretary the
choice of the nominating committee and
the club will be unanimous for him:
.The challenger for the Perpetual cup i3
nearly ready for launching, but the syn
dicate Is not anxious to hurry work upon
her. The boat is quite safe where she
is, and at this season the anchorage off
the Sausalito Clubhouse is somewhat
hazardous, as a violent southeaster may
come up at any time and cause a boat
to drag her moorings. The bands will be
fitted on the mast and the. wire j stays
spliced before the mast Is stepped. After
the yacht is launched a day's work will
put' her in ' readiness . to receive her can
,vas. The general impression Is â¢ that in
'a stiff blow she, will heel over consider
ably. The weather that would be un
favorable to her speed is a light breeze,
and choppy sea, as then ' her flat bow
would be pounded by, the waves and the
boat's headway stopped. Â¦ Â¦
It is believed that with a strong breeze
and moderate sea nothing on the bay can
touch her. The yacht has alneady been
looked over by many local yachtsmen and
her lines and construction have been com
mented I on favorably. When ready for
: launching, : she :will be hoisted by slings
from the cradle and dropped into tha
water.. It is probable her launching will
be made a club eventl ' -Â»
Congressman Victor E.Metcalf will bs
asked to *< urge that Belvedere Cove be
dredged and deepened to provide a safe
anchorage for small craft. It in expected
the California Northwestern Railway will
fill up the- lagoon j behind Tiburon. and
erect railroad shops on the ground. When
that work is 'begun, the yachtsmen and
owners of small craft will have no secure
winter, moorings in the bay. All , the
yachtsmen, the California Northwestern
Railway and .the inhabitants of Tiburon
" and . Belvedere, as well as owners of
schooners and .- launches trading out of
Tiburon or- -bringing cargoes to It for
shipment on the rallrcad, are interested
in. the plan: '
A. M, Cook has sold the sloop Anita.
Her new owner, L. Spotswood, will join

craft to be enrolled will probably be the
launch to be built for F. A. Hyde, which
willbe fitted: with a .Union gas engine of
four . cylinders - and twenty-four horse
power. â¢" She) was designed by Bacon and
will be built. by. a local builder. It Is said

next Legislature will make some change
in- the - laws governing- -duck Â¦ shooting. .
Either October will be cut out and Feb
ruary restored or it may be returned to
the former state, the season opening: in
October and closing March 1. .
It is expected that the law prohibiting
the sale of quail will result in making
these great game birds numerous withliÂ»
the next three years. Well informed
sportsmen say limiting the bag would
not have the desired effect, as market
hunters find a way to defeat this provision
of the law.
Otto Feudner spent last Sunday at the
Stewart Pond, near Denverton, meeting
with his usual success. He accompanied
George R. Field and Frank Owen, who.
with two other sportsmen, have leased
the shooting privileges at this great pond.
The joint bag was 148 ducks. 25 snipe ami
7 geese. Feudner secured the limit on
both ducks and snipe.
The members of the Alameda Gun Club
enjoyed a good shoot at their preserves
on the Sonoma marsh. Among the mem
bers who returned last Sunday with full
game bags were: Louis Bolander. Paul
Klngton. Frank Geisler. Frank' Naughton
and many others.
. The four members of the Spooney Gun
Club who shot over the club's fresh
water ponds on the Mount Eden marsh
last Sunday enjoyed good sport. The bag
to the four guns was 165 birds. The mem
bers were: Dr. E.- N. Short. L. R. Lar
zalere, William Whltehead and George
Morse.
F. S. Judah. Cornelius Roman. Dr.
George Gere, Walter Woods and H. B.
Gregg shot over the Empire Club's-pre
serves on the Sonoma marsh. Mr. Judah
killed twenty-two "cans." The others did
nearly as well.
J. B. Hauer al3o secured twenty-two
ducks, shooting, by invitation, on a pri
vate preserve.
There was but poor sport near Alva
rado last Sunday. Ed Kerrtson secured
only six and George Franzen nine. *
Tom Watson and Ben Baum secured a
good bag of English snipe near Shellville,
Sonoma County.
. Ed Bowen secured a mixed bag of six
teen "cans" and teal near San Pablo.
J&. Mildner and John Struven killed
thirty "cans'* and teal.
Herman Natheson killed seventeen,
chiefly sprig and spoonbills, near Alva
rado.
Two members of the Canvasback Chit>

pre<Â»erves near Suisun. The members of
the' club are: "Joe" Sweeney. "Jim"
Maynard, Clarence Haight and Mr. Ed

WINTER SEASON
OF TENNIS ENDS
prove one of the most interesting ever '
held here. The entry in both the Derby
and lhe all-ape stake is a representative
one, and an unusually large attendance
of well-known sportsmen is expected. A
number of them are anticipating some
good shooting while in the south.
Clinton E. Worden's Lady Jane is sick
at Santa Maria, and Trainer Coutts
doubts whether she will round into, condi
tion In time to be started in the trials.
W. W. Van Arsdale's Bell Boy, by Tony
Boy-Lena Belle, his chief reliance for the
Derby, has gone wrong and will not be a.
contend :r at the trials. He was placed at
the northern trials and was expected to
make a. good ehowlng. It is doubtful it
Mr. Van Arsdale will have a representa
tive in the Derby, as all his young dogs
are reported sick. Trainer Babcock will
rely chiefly on Peach Blossom, second in
the Derby, and first in the all-age last
year, and Count's Mark as representa
tives, in the all-ages htake.
These are two members of the most re
markable litter ever whelped in California-
There were seven puppies in the litter, by
Count Gladstone IV-Peach Mark. They
all grew up strong- and rug-ged and have
never had a moment's illness, escaping
all the ills to which their species usually
fall heir. In the litter were Peach Blos
som, Count's Mark, Sir Peach
Stone, Shadow. Lady and Peach Mark IL
Five of these are entered in the all-age
this year. In addition to the two from
the Van Arsdale- kennel there - will be
Lady, owned by Joe Terry, Peach Blos
som II and Shadow.
Last year five were entered in the Der
by, four starting. This was won by Lady,
with Peach Blossom second. They then
went in the ail-age and the placing was
reversed. Peach Blossom winning and
Lady being second. They are all grand
dogs for a gentleman to shoot over. Peach
Stone and Sir. Mark have not been con
sidered up to the standard for field trial
work, but have shown their owner excel
lent sport in the field in his private shoot-
Ing.
The gunmen have. entered upon their
last month when they may shoot ducks
and -quail. Under the new State law the
season will close on February 1. This
will bring to an untimely end the best
season the sportsmen have enjoyed in
years. The cold, dry weather has kept
the birds from scattering and excellent
bags have been the rule, especially on the

of that difference. During that period of
eleven years, notwithstanding the enormous
increase In traffic, four so-called ' trunk lines
have through destructive competition fatted
and then reorganized, and all but one of them
have been absorbed by "the stronger surviving
lines. Destructive competition has forced the
weakest lines into bankruptcy and to-day they
are owned by the lines that were able to main
tain their position and credit, giving the ability
to acquire these bankrupt roads. - - -
. The Baltimore and Ohio and the Pennsylvania
for half a century have been rival roads. Both
States and cities . actively aided In building
them upâ destructive competition between them
has finally, resulted in the Pennsylvania Rail
road owning the Baltimore and Ohio. - Have
the rates advanced? Have the people along
the line of the Baltimore and Ohio suffered?
On the contrary the first step has been to fur
nish money to cut down the grades, double
track the line from the Ohio River to Chicago
and to furnish cars and facilities to handle the
business at best advantage and at such rates
as - will enable the shippers along the line to

said: B9I
" Careful examination of the railway problem
from a national standpoint win, I believe, show
beyond question that the business of the coun
try has outgrown the facilities on most of tha
trunk lines,- and. that new facilities will, be
provided to relieve the situation.. Rates in the
United States are much lower than In- other
countries. Wages are higher, . the . cost of
much of the material is much higher than ' In
Europe, yet rate charges Is Europe are fully
twice. as high as In America- The conditions
in these countries change very rapidly â while
rates have been - eut in two in twenty years,
all ' kinds of labor and : materials used by the
railways have advanced from 30 to 60 per cent.
Nothing but the Increased .volume- of traffic
has made It possible to reduce rates as they
have been reduced. ?j&gggjjmmBm
To-day we find the volume of traffic so great
east of Chicago that the railways are not able
to move it under the present conditions. How
will these conditions be changed and at whose
cost? Who will - build . new lines or Increase
old .ones? These are the questions which I will
'not undertake to answer further than to say
.that. the West must have the facilities or suffer
for the want of them. The public must bear
,ln mind that & bankrupt road cannot furnish,

hope In the future that with better methods
of cultivation and more knowledge of what is
required your condition may be constantly Im
proved,: and if your condition Is improved ours
â¢will certainly share it with you. As the-vol

owns the capital stock of a ' railway or an
other;'whether the capital stock. Is owned by
ten men or one thousand, by persons or by cor
porations. The capital stocjc of a railway com
pany Is personal property to be sold, . trans
ferred - from one man to another and any one
may purchase and . hold all that he has the
means to | buy and ! pay for. The capital stock
of the Northern . Pacific and the Great Northern
will ' be : held by somebody,- persons or corpora

3 Assuming that the line of the Burlington had
not been constructed and that the Great North
ern and Northern Pacific Jointly had raised the
money and were engaged in the construction of
It, would there be anything to meet the disap
proval of the States.iraversed by the line of tt.e
Great Northern and/Northern Pacific? On. the
contrary, would not such a course have been
hailed with approval as a means of opening tip
markets for Northwestern â¢ produce and Â¦ of
reaching markets In the South and .Southwfat
and. of securing business. Increasing the vol
ume of the traffic of the Great Northern and
the Northern Pacific, , thus making reduction of
rates and adding to the general prosperity of
the Northwest? Instead of building the Bur
liugton system, or a Hne of railway alongside
It, the Great Northern Â¦ and Northern Pacific
purchases Â¦ the capital stock of a line already
constructed. Instead of issuing stock or boml3
for the purpose of raising money for building
a line reaching the same country, bonds were
issued ' to purchase the - stock of a constructed
line.
â¢ There, has recently been an attempt to show
that we have no interest In the building up of
the prosperity of the people of your State and
of the Northwest. If we did not do everything
in our power to build you up we would be false
to our best Interests. Our object In acquiring
the Burlington Jointly with the Northern Pa
cific Railway was to insure an outlet to the
best markets for the grain, livestock and lum
ber for the Northern States and to increase the
volume of our* traffic to the end that we might
at all times be able to establish the lowest rates
and Â¦ most favorable conditions under which
traffic must be ' carried. The Burlineton, j with
its own rails, reaches Chicago, , Peorla. Rock
Island, Davenport, Qulncy, Alton, Hannibal.
St. Louis, St. Joseph, Kansas City, Dea Molnes,
Omaha and Denver, and connects with Â¦ the
main arteries of traffic of the whole country. . -
Twenty-five years ago it was supposed that
competition was necessary to reduce rates. I
think that we have shown in the Northwest
that without competition rates , have .been re
duced faster than anywhere else -in the country.
Reduction of the "Bates.
Hill opened with a few- words of praise
for the farmers, saying - that "the future
welfare. of the country depends more upon
the wise disposition of the public domain,
so-'asV to -secure homes for. the ; people,
.than j upon j any 'Â¦ other single condition in
the; nat&n." He J discussed j the \ need of
action ' to k secure, more markets for j the
surplus of products, controlling the action
of . other nations in that respect. After,
speaking 'of the development of the North
west - he j said he .thought s , one kind of.
of interest 1 V which really.ex
isted was: that between the producer of
tonnage and the carrier; -the land and its.
products and â¢ the : railroads will either
prosper together or be Â¦ poor - together.
Much is being said, he declared, about
combination 'between railroads and-com
petitiou. The law of the survival of the
fittest must inevitably end such compe
tition as exists by the destruction of tho
weaker by the stronger. .This haÂ» already
been done In he East. He said In part:

Hogs said to-night that he had Â«clti
land in the Beaumont field for $300,000 per
acre, and ho considered the new oil land
which he holds just as valuable. At this
rate the discovery near Columbia means
an increase of Hogg's wealth to the ex
cnt of more than 580,000,000. This is ex
clusive of 14,000 acres adjoining the new
Â¦well, on which Hogg and his associates
have a lease. Hogg says that this discov
ery is of much greater Importance than
the Beaumont oil discovery. The new field
Is Â¦ only eighteen miles from the water
port of Velasco.
- Hogg, denied the published report that
he has disposed of any of his interests in
the Beaumont oil field to the Standard
Oil Company. He said he sold a part of
his Interests there to English capltlista
tor $2,256,000.
Former Governor J. S. Hogg, who owns
a one-eighth interest in the new well, ar
rived here to-day after a three months'
absence in New. York. He received tele
grams this evening confirming Wardeli'Â»
statement as to the amount of the tiow
of the well. Hogg , Is enthusiastic over
the rich strike. It means that he is ona
of the richest men in tho country, as ha
owns in fee simple 270 acres of land of
the 400 acres comprising the elevation on
which thn oil is found. Â¦ â¢
Thomas "Wardell arrived here . to-day
direct from the new well. He says It la
a guiuine gusher and flowing at least
30,0)0 barrels of oil per day." It was not
completed . when the oil stream burst
forth,- and it i3 thought that had it been
well cleaned and baled the flow would
amount to twice the present output, as
it is an o5ght-lnch hole. The oil has not
yet been tested, but It has the appear
ance of being of the same character as
the Beaumont oil. Â¦
AUSTIN, Tex.,' Jan. 10.â The discovery
of oil yesterday, near Columbia, Tex.. In
an entirely new? field, situated about 150
miles west of the. Beaumont oil district,
has caused intense excitement throughout
the State.

LEXINGTON. Ky.. Jan. lO.-Lexington
Chapter, United Daughters of the Con
federacy, hÂ«Â« sent a written petition to
Charles B. Scott, manager of the Lexing
ton Opera-house, asking that the play,
"Uncle Tom's Cabin," be not played
again at the opera-house.
The members of the -chapter give as
reasons that the best citizens and old
families living in and about the city were
once slave-owners as a heritage, not of
their own choosing; that the Incidents of
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" are not typical of
slave life In the South, but of isolated
oases, the production of the play and its
being advertised with bloodhounds and
pictures of an old negro in chains and a
slave-owner with whip in hand, give a
false Idea of the times to the children of
the city and its disrespect to the South
ern gentlemen and their families in this
part of the country.
The petition is signed by four of the
most prominent women of the chapter
and Indorsed unanimously by the mem
bers. It has created a sensation here.

FOR many a year the orators of Democracy
kept the country well informed of the anniver
sary cf Jackson's victory fat New Orleans.
They made it the occasion for banquets and speeches
dealing with: affairs of state and outlining political
programmes. This year the day of glorious memory
was passed without any oratory, of a; notable kind. A
considerable number of Democratic clubs held ban
quets arid a considerable number of orators spoke,
but they spoke mildly and in a low voice.- The' coun
try did not hear. them, for it was not listening, nor
would it have heard much had it been listening. ,:
These, are the", lean years of Democracy, the days
of its wanderings in the wilderness without a Moses
and without the hope of a promised land. Twice in
succession it has' been defeated in contests for the
Presidency, and four times it has l6st controrof the
House" of Representatives. In the Northern and the
Western States at the present time it is well nigh out
of politics. Northern Democracy has .but few Rep
resentatives in the .House and only three Senators.
In the South alone has the party any j strength, and
even 'there its strength lies solely in the race , issue.
Southern Democrats have no agreement upon any
fiscal, financial or colonial policy. They have neither
a leader nor a platform to offer to the forlorn Demo

It seems that the imperial ownership and adminis
tration has contributed its share to the embarrass^
ment of the state. The railroad revenues have de
clined, and yet credits are asked to extend the state
railways and build feeders to the systems already in
existence. Being embarked in business enterprise,
the state finds it hard to let go.
The Kaiser seems no 4 to see the influence of state
socialism, or paternalism, ' iii producing this result,
for he advises the use of the public credit to house
state' workmen and the minor imperial officials.
How far this will contribute to the. general relief does
not appear. . ; . ; -.".
All this is changed in one year. This, great in
dustrial machine is rusting in idleness, and the note
of defiance is succeeded by the cry of distress. Let
him that standeth take heed lest he fall, is the lesson
for us to derive from this appalling reverse.
At the Paris Exposition the German exhibit
brought the empire to the front as the leading indus
trial rival of the United States. It seemed that her
paternal training of her people had at last converted
them into a productive machine of such power as to
defy us and the rest of the world, challenging all
comers to a competition in which she was confident
of her power to win."
Within the last year Germany has seen the tide ebb
and is now in the midst of distress and reverse equal
to that which we suffered between 1893 and 1897.
The Government finds its credit strained, and is un
comfortably limited in carrying out projects that were
devised when there seemed no end to the prosperity
it was enjoying.
THE Kaiser's speech 1 from the throne to the
Prussian Diet frankly discloses the hard indus
trial and financial conditions'of the German em
pire. The shrinkage in trade and the reaction from
overtrading and speculation Jiave disabled the smaller
German states, which are no longer able to pay their
imperial tribute. Conditions teach impressively the
futility of expectations that a high tide of prosperity
can be permanently maintained.

A serious evil should be dealt with seriously. The
people of California should make up their minds
whether they will maintain the Railroad Commission
cr not If they are going to maintain it they should
clothe it with power to enforce its rulings. If they
are not going to giv- it sufficient authority, to act
efficiently they should abolish it. To leave the regu
lation of railway rates to the Legislature is not a de
sirable ,thing, but better that than 'no regulation at
all. The issue, in fact, is a simple one. The Rail
road Commission at present is suffering from par
alysis, and we should either cure'it or kill it.
The relation of the railroads to the people and to
t".ie law is becoming serious. It is by no means a
local question. The Interstate Commerce Commis
sion has repeatedly reported to Congress a statement
cf its inability to maintain the Federal laws on the
subject of pooling and freight discriminations and
has asked for an increase of power to enforce its de
cisions. Similar reports come from State commis
sions in every part of the Union. The roads will not
obey the law, and any attempt to compel obedience
is met by a prompt injunction from the courts.
When once a case is brought before the court the
tearing is postponed from month to month' and
from year to year, and during all that time the roads
go right along violating the "law and defying State
commission and the Interstate Commission alike. "
The situation is one in which the railroads can
mv "Heads, we win; tails, the people lose." If the
commission decide in favor of the roads the people
cannot get an injunction, but if they decide in favor
cf the people the roads can get an injunction from
any compliant Judge they apply to. Under such
conditions, what is the commission- worth?^
From the very first the Railroad Commission has
been a disappointment to the people. Doubtless it
can be shown that something has been accomplished
by it, but the tptal amount of such accomplishment
is; far short of what the people expected. Even
when the board undertakes to do its duty it finds it-
S'ilf powerless to enforce its rules. Developments in
the oil rate case afford a present instance of its weak
ness. After two hearings, "in which a large number
of witnesses were examined and able attorneys pre
sented arguments of each side, the commission made
a slight reduction in oil rates. The shippers were
gratified, the people were pleased; it seemed as if
the commission were at last to achieve something
of public benefit. It has proven, however: to be a
case where appearances are deceptive. Thelrailroads
have gone into court and the Judges have issued in
junctions which nullify the action of the commission.
The victory is with the roads. They can restore
t'iieir old rates whenever they please.
CALIFORNIA has established and maintains
at considerable cost a Board of Railroad
Commissioners designed for the purpose of
protecting shippers and travelers from railroad ex
tortions or from any unfair discriminations in favor
of one man or corporation against another. The Com
missioners are clothed with power to summon wit
nesses and to make examinations into freight and pas
senger rates, and they were supposed to have power

Colonel Partridge is proud of his Puritan ancestry. ;The
name was imported early in the seventeenth century from
Berwick-on-Tweed, England, by a man who called himself
William Partrigg. He settled in Hartford, Conn., and became
a business man in the community. The family was a very
extensive^ one in Massachusetts in the latter part of the
eighteenth century. , \
Colonel Partridge's mother Is nearly 90 years old, and take 3
a lively interest in her son, who is devoted to her! They at
tend the Congregational church together regularly when h^

Partridge, who lives in Colorado Springs.
He is something of an expert on military dress and he 13
also an expert horseman. He will likely improve the uniform
of the foot patrol and stir up the mounted police as well in
several of their deficiencies.
training:. He served three years In the Union army and was
three times elected colonel of the .Twenty-third Regiment of
the State militia in Brooklyn. He has never been an advocate
of radical changes in any branch of the city or State service,
but there Is little doubt about his Intention of reforming the
New York Police Department in more ways than one. As an
appointee of Mr. Low he is practically bound to reform the
department morally, and he will undoubtedly reform It In ap
pearance and in many minor details as to system from his
own volition.
One of his rar*e capabilities for ' the position of single
headed Police Commissioner, of New York is his military
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
: When the President was â¢ Governor of New York he was
pressed hard for a good man to succeed George W. Aldrldge,
Superintendent of the Department of Public Works at Albany.
A man .was wanted to dive into the tangled question of New
fork canals. Partridge took up the herculean task, and not
only did more work in one year than his predecessor had done
during his entire term in office, but he saved the State the
first year $137,000. He is in every sense a reformer, but a very
systematic and methodical reformer. While he has never been
a sensational reformer,' yet all public life has been de
voted U> I reforming public offices) from the Brooklyn Fire De
partment to the State Public Works.
; " : There . is little doubt that President Roosevelt sug
gested Colonel Partridge to Mayor-elect Seth Low as the best
man to placs at the head of the New York Police Department.
While Mr. Low discovered Colonel Partridge as an. honest and
efficient public officer when the Mayor-elect was Mayor - cf
Brooklyn/ President Roosevelt found . him qualified for *a
higher office in the service of the State. :
JOHN NELSON PARTRIDGE, the ' new head of New
York's 7000 policemen, is 63 years old and has a clean pul>
llc and private record. ' He has held three Government
positions since 1882. :

; Mr. Martin asserts after all his studies into the
conditions of s rural England that not only are the
large farms unprofitable but that the small farmers
are making no progress. In fact, it appears the en
tire industry is declining and that nothing can save
it but a system of protection from foreign competi
tion. That protection, however, is not likely to be
given. The British workingman ,: is not willing: to
tax his bread and-meat for the, purpose. of benefiting
the land-owners. The decline in' British agriculture/
therefore, has. not yet. reached the limit- It must
sink still further before it reaches a point where the
nation will be. aroused to the need of doing some
thing to save it.
From a summary of the report given in the London
Chronicle it' appears the -acreage under wheat in
1001 was 144,077 acres less than ' in ; 1900. Â¦ In the bar
ley acreage there was: a, decrease of 17,817,, in t oats
29,185, in beans 11,627, in turnips 24,081, in- mangolds
15,61 1, and I in .many other crops there was a propor
tionate decline.' There; was an increased, acreage
i planted; in rye, .potatoes, lucerne and several smaller
crops,, but the increase. by, no means counterbalanced
the decrease".: The total' increases, barely amount -to
00,000 acres all told, while the "decreases aggregate
about 297,000 acres, ; so; that more than 200,000 acres ,
cultivated in. 1900 were left uncultivated in" 1901. .
. Along with the decline in the acreage of crops
there was a decline in the number of farm animals
of every kind except horses. The -showing is an in
crease of 11,268 horses, but a decrease of 41,276
cattle, 215,026 sheep and 202,067 hogs. .
It hasbeen the, belief that' fruit-growing would af
ford the British landowner a means of obtaining a
profit from the soil even though he can no longer "
compete in the production of grain, hay or livestock,
but those who have tried fruit-growing seem to have
been disappointed. Mr.. Martin, author of "The Ruin
of Rural England," contributes to the Chronicle a
review of the agricultural situation, and in speaking
of the orchards he says: "In one center where the
fruity industries made great strides in. recent years
some of the smaller, growers were in great distress
because they could ;not meet their payments as re
cently as last Michaelmas." He adds that British or
chardists have "to sell their fruit in a market flooded
with foreign produce brought from the very ends of
the: earth at one-fourth the freight it costs them for
similar service." .. : â¢
GREAT BRITAIN is once more discussing
the portentous decline in - her rural indus
tries. The preliminary', report of the agri
cultural returns for: 1891 shows that the diminution
of land employed for farming purposes goes steadily
on, so that it seems to be only a question l of time
when there will; hardly be any such thing as a farm
ing; industry in the country. >: ";:
BRITISH AGRICULTURE.
Every now. and then for many years past there has
been revived a scheme for separating New York City
fro- 1 ", the. State and: setting: it'iip . as a' distinct, com-'
monwealthV and it has 'popped "up^ once more. It is
a foregone; conclusion ; it ; win : be killed. ' The rural
legislators of the State'^ould; not -for anything'aban
don their right to reform â¬ the city every year or so
and share :in its spoils, between -times:; : - ' .' v
The State has done its utmost under existing law
to clear its skirts by delegating a representative of
the office of the Attorney General to conduct the
prosecution. That the necessity for this 1 was shame
ful no one disputes. It arose in the manifest laxity
of local authority and its indisposition to punish the
guilty. It is no excuse for overlooking such a- crime
that its victims were despised or distrusted and that
their murder, withal cowardly and brutal in the ex
treme, was approved by their neighbors. The courts
were open for their punishment for the offenses
charged against them. The Justice of the Peace who
is charged with knotting the ropes and advising their
use, even instructing the active agents of the outrage
in the details of the unlawful execution so as to in
sure its success, was himself the court of first instance
in jurisdiction over them, and was given by law the
power to initiate their punishment and restrain their
evil courses. If it, appear proved that he took the
part alleged, his offense is so much blacker than any
charged against the victims as to make it necessary
that he be made an example of, to deter his suc
cessors, chosen to administer the law, from them
selves violating it in the most conspicuous manner
possible.
Vr The eyes o { th e State are. upon the jury, and men
await in patience its verdict.
The proceedings seem to be evidence that in crimi
nal cases the State as well as the accused should have
the right to a change of venue. â¢ If a community un
derstand that by general agreement it cannot condone
crime and give shelter to criminals, but that the law
shall have the right to vindication by changing the
scene of trial and locating it among a people who
are not under duress nor affected by sympathy witfi
the criminals and the crime, it will be the means of
creating therein a wholesome public opinion which
will not permit such offenses as this, which has tar
nished the reputation of the whole State. California
cannot afford to : have her smallest corner, even,
known as the dark and bloody ground, where people
mistake their passion or prejudice for a warrant to
administer to others such punishment as they please,
regardless of the protection the law extends for the
rights of person and the sanctity of human life.
Wantonness cannot be permitted to usurp the place
of law/the lyncher that of the bench.
No paper has the right to prejudge the case, as to
do so .would be a part of the howling improprieties
that have characterized the hearing of the case. But
prejudgment. does not consist in expressing the
opinion that the testimony, procured under the great
est difficulties, seems to : fasten the guilt upon the right
parties so plainly that the jury will find but one way
to keep its oath and declare that that remote corner
of California is not outside the pale of law.
It is to be hoped that. the result will finally.'vindi
cate American jurisprudence. A sworn jury sits in
the case, to find a verdict on the facts. That the
court will givc.it the law 'applicable to those facts
there can be no doubt, for the Judge, notwithstand
ing his errors of temper, seems to be fearless and de-;
termined that the good name of his jurisdiction shall
be upheld.
THE scenes enacted in the trial of the Modoc
lynchers are of such a character as: to seem en
tirely . foreign to American life. The ; pas sages
between the. court and the attorneys for the defense
are so violent, so subversive of the dignity of judicial
procedure, so opposed to the order and decency of a
proceeding in which men are on. trial for their, lives,
as to make one wonder that they, can be the outcome
of any stratum of American civilization. \

William Dugan, who lives at 280 . East

yesterday morning from Folsom-street
wharf. He was sinking for the last time

THE colliers, Titania and Asuncion
arrived in port yesterday morning,'
both a day late and both glisten
ing with the salt crystals from
the waves that had been batter-
Ing them from the Straits of San Juan de
Fuca to the Golden Gate. . The steam
schooner Santa Ana, which also arrived,
had a similar experience. The three
coasters encountered one of the heaviest
southeasterly gales of the winter. The
Asuncion drove through the worst of it,
but the Titania and . Santa Ana after
sticking their noses around Cape Flattery
sought the shelter of Neah Bay and re
mained at anchor for about twelve hours.
The Asuncion was heavily laden, and
during the height of the storm made near
ly one mile in four hours. A heavy south
westerly swell added to the discomfort,
and all hands on the three coasters were
pretty well tired out when port was
reached yesterday morning.
Gaelic Brings Few Passengers.
The Occidental and Oriental 1 ' Steamship
Company's steamer Gaelic arrived yes
terday from the Orient with but seven
cabin passengers. Her â¢ cargo, while not
very heavy, was of considerable value,
one consignment of opium from Macao
being valued at more than $1,000,000.
Heavy weather was encountered thrpugli
out the voyage. During one of the blows
a lifeboat was carried out of the davits
and .badly smashed. Captain A. E. S.
Hambleton has had command of the Gae
lic during this voyage, relieving Captain
Finch, Â¦who has been taking a vacation
ashore. Captain Hambleton will leave in
a few days for Liverpool, having been
called home by the White Star line for
promotion. Captain Finch will resume
command. The smallness of the passen
ger list Is due to the fact that the Gaelic
left the Orient during the Christmas holi
days. Among the passengers was Miss
ML F. Chapman, daughter of the late
Dr. Chapman of the Doric. Miss Chap
man was visiting Dr. Howe of Yokohama,
and had Intended to travel in the Orient
for some time. Her father's death, which,
occurred recently In this city, necessi
tated her return. ..

NOW PRESIDENT
The idea of the- meeting originated with
Home. Rulers and has been stated by
some at their leaders as a non-polltlcal
gathering, though they admit that it is
to agitate lor an extra session of the Leg
islature and for city and county govern
ment. The meeting promises to be a large
one, though speakers outside of the Home
Rule Republican party have generally re
fused ,to attend.
A number of suits have been brought in
the Territorial courts to establish exclu
sive fishing rights to ocean waters about
the islands, with a view to the condemna
tion of. such rights, as provided for by
the organic act. The act provided that
all Hawaiian fishing laws, which granted
many such rights, should be repealed, but
allowed the owners of such rights to es
tablish their ownership in the Territorial
courts, such rights to be acquired for the
benefit of the public by condemnation pro
ceedings. The suits now pending, with,
others to be brought, will straighten out
the system so that there will be no pri
vate fishing rights in ocean waters here.
?An- election was held last week In the
Chinese United Societies here and resulted
in a. victory for the reform element as
against the class represented by the Con
sul, Yang Wei Pin.
The Home Rulers have called a "non
partisan" mass meeting for this evening
to ratify the President's message In so fax
as it refers to Hawaii, and to discuss the
application of the American system of
government to Hawaii. They invited Gov
ernor Dole, Secretary Cooper, Judge Es
tee and others to speak, but most of those
Invited declined. Governor Dole declined
the Invitation because he understood that
one of the topics to be discussed was tha
executive policy of the Territory, while
Cooper informed the committee which in
vited him that he considered the meet
ing a political one and \rould not attenU ,
for. that reason. The committee sent him*
a very sharp reply, disclaiming political
Intentions.
The former captain and part owner in
the Hesper, Captain C. O. Sodergren, is
now in Oahu Jail here, serving a six
months' sentence for cruelty on the high
seas. The vessel will be surveyed before
she leaves Honolulu.
A special election will be called, as pro
vided for by the organic act of Hawaii,
to elect a member of the House of Rep
resentatives, to succeed the late A. F. Gil
fillan, who 'was killed by a fall from a
cai in Philadelphia, on December 22. Gil
fHlan was a member from the Fourth Dis
trict, which elected a Republican ticket
throughout, consisting of six members.
Prince "Cupid" has already beer named
as the Home Rule Republican candidate*
for the place and will probably run.
though he is away and has not yet signi
fied his acceptance. The , Republicans
have not yet decided upon a candidate.
They claim to be aDle to carry the dis
trict by a big majority, as they did so in
the last election. '
HONOLULU, Jan. 4-â The bark Hesper
has arrived here in distress and is now

for Fremantle, Australia, from Victoria,

THREATENS TO REVOKE

Washington State Medical Board Not

Scandal.
Â¦TACOMA, Jan. 10.â The State Board of
Medical Examiners threatens to revoke
the license of Dr. J. G. Stewart of Seattle,
who seems to have been the principal fig
ure In the transaction whereby Dr. O. V.
Lawson of Seattle paid $U)QO for what pur
ported to be answers to questions asked
by the State Board at the medical exami
nation held; here this week. Dr. .Stewart
has frankly admitted that he acted as:gro
between i for a friend of Lawson- and" the
mysterious Dr. Wilson, who is . said to
have obtained the answers, but whose real
identity has not yet been disclosed. Law-
Bon's friend, Braid, to-day obtained from
Dr. Stewart- the $600 advanced by Lawson
and returned it to the latter. Braid proves
that he was acting only as a friend of
Lawson, his chief desire being to keep
Lawson In Seattle, because he . was a
heavy advertising patron' of the newspa
per of which Braid is advertising mana
ger. â¢Â¦ . Â¦â¢Â¦ . - â¢- â¢ â¢---.. .Â°. ,-,.
The Â¦ State Board yesterday summoned
Dr. ; Stewart before it. to explain- why. his
license should not be revoked. Stewart
defied the board and said it has no author
ity to take away his license. The board
adjourned to meet in Seattle early in Feb

sidered and acted u^on.

no. less mysterious than those
which marked his disappearance .from
home and business on May 4. last. He
will ; not say where he has been during
the past, eight months, but admits that
he has . not been out" of- the State. Â¦ He is
bronzed with the life he has been lead
ing in the open air/ probably as a, labor

his ' wife his fortune, estimated \ at $50,000,

all manner of menâ with men who were
Illiterate and poor, as well as those who
were cultivated and rich. And what did
more than anything else to restore him

After hearing the argument Justice
Wallace ordered the dismissal. He held
that the Mayor acted within the scope of
his office and duty in sending the defend

acted, in good faith, honestly believing the
facts to be as he reported. When he sub
mitted the report to. Mayor Martin Cap
tain Newberry sent a copy to General Otis
and inclosed a letter, asking if it con
tained anything confidential that Otis
wanted eliminated or corrected. This was
convincing proof, the Justice declared,
that the report was without malice. Gen
eral Otis had had "time* to correct the re
port before it was submitted to the Coun
cil, but had not done so.
No testimony was introduced by the de
fense. Many politicians had been subpe
naed and It was supposed local politics
would be gtjne into.
The preliminary examination lasted four
days. Yesterday afternoon the prosecu
tion rested its case. Attorney Cothran,
for Newberry, made a motion for dismis

specific charge was made and that there
was not sufficient evidence to substantiate

SAN JOSE, Jan. 10.â The examination
of Captain of Police Perry H. Newberry
en a charge of criminal libel came to an
abrupt end this afternoon, when Justice
of the Peace Wallace granted the defend
ant's" motion for a dismissal, on Â¦' the
ground that no specific charge had been
proved and libel had not been committed.
The case, which grew out of the article
published in the Los Angeles Times, styl
ing San JcsÂ« "the Sodom of the 'Pacific
Coast," attracted great -attention. New
berry had been sent to . Los Angeles Â¦ by
Mayor Martin to learn "the name of the
author of the article, from General Otis,
and reported to the Mayor that- Franklin
Hichborn had written the article. He de
clared General Otis and City Editor An
drew of the Times had given him this in
formation. When this report was made
public to the City Council Hichborn
caused Newberry's arrest on a. charge or
criminal libel. It has since developed that
Henry E. Miller, an ex-student of the
Normal School, wrote the article and that
Hichborn had nothing to do with it." Mil

The difference that comes from not as
sessing the railroad companies'- properties
at even the figures of stock and bond lia
bility to which the officers -of the com
pany have made oath is easily illustrated
by taking the mileage, of either; of the
exclusively California roads and apply
ing, comparatively the assessments by the
State Board of Equalization and the
amount of the liability per mile men
tioned .in the _ foregoing. - Taking: the ' as
sessment at $11,000 per mile for round fig
ures, although the State Equalizers; make
it some hundreds of dollars less per mile
for assessment purposes, the comparative
statement would be as follows, for the
roads wholly. In the State: '.,

debt amounting to $76,342 58 and $66,

of which a great part is in California;

Huge Values Implied.
On" page 25 of the annual report of the
Southern Pacific Company to the Board
of Railroad: Commissioners, for the year
ending June -30, 1900, will be found by the
diligent seeker many details combined in
.tabular shape. These give the mileage,
the . amount of capital stock, the funded
debt, the total stock liability and the rate
!of liability per mile of the following
'named corporations at the date .men-,
ttioned:- South Pacific Coast', Southern Pa
cific Railroad of California," Southern Pa
cific of Arizona, Southern Pacific of New
Mexico, Central Pacific and Qregon and
California.
Â» Some of these lines are entirely In this
State. In the case of the Central Pacific
the more valuable part is in California:
At the bottom of neatly arranged columns
of figures are totals â¢which could be of
value to the State Board of Equalization,
because they state the total mileage of
the Southern Pacific Company's lines and
the average stock and bonded indebted
ness per mile, and so form .a starting
point for an intelligent - investigation.
There were, as sworn to by H. E. Hunt
ington and J. L. Willcutt on June 30, 1900,
trackage of the roads named amounting
to 5334.56 miles and the average stock and
bond liability of all this track was $88,
128 25 per mile. . \ . . .-.-. . '-\ -
The South Pacific Coast lines, all of
which are. in the State of California, were
found to be carrying , a funded debt of
$5,500,000 and. stock amounting to $6,000,000
on 101.10 miles of track, or $11,500,000 in all,
being an average of $113,748 76 per mile,
as â¢ reported by- Messrs. Huntington and
Willcutt. The Southern Pacific Railroad
Company of California, whose trkeks are
in this State, had a funded debt of $77,
803,500 and stock of $101,289,160, the total
being $179,092,660 on 2690.41 miles of track,
the average being $67,065 60 per mile. ; The
Central Pacific Company, whose produc
tive business is mainly due to this State,
carried $120,672,986 70 in funded, debt, â¢ $79.
275,500 in stock and. had 1348.66. miles of
track, so that the average, as stated un
der oath,' the statements of averages be
ing" made by Messrs. Huntington and "WlU
cutt- along with the other figures, M was
$148,257 15 per mile. - Beside these figures
the plain man will â¢ rub his eyes very
hard, if he is a taxpayer and not a tax
dodger, when he sees that the State
Board of Equalization . made the assess
ment In 1901 on. these properties at the
rate of less than $11,000 per mile for the
lines of the Southern Pacific Company, and

Says to All Sick Women: "Giva Mrs. Pinkham a Chance,
I Know She Can Help Toxics She Did Me."
: "Dear Mrs. PiNKJaAM : âThe world praises great reformers ; their
names and fames are in tiie rears of everybody, and, the public press
helps spread the goodltidings. ;Among them, all Lydia IL Pinkham^s
name goes to posterity, .with' a'softly breathed blessing irom the lips of
thousands upon thousands of /women who; have been restored to their
families 'when life hung by ~a thread, ; and/by thousands of others whose

:. Â¦ MRS. tt.'F." ROBERTS: Â¦
*'I know -whereof I speak, for I have received much valuable bene-
fit myself through the use of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, and for years I have known dozens of women who have. suffered
with displacement, ovarian troubles, nlcerations and inflammation who
are strong and well today, simply through the use of your Compound.
I feel sure you will never know one-half the good you have done hu-
manity, and I only wish every suffering woman could know what you
can do for j her, would she only .just give you the chance. Fraternally
yours, Mrs. II. F. Roberts, 140OIcGee St., Kansas City, Mo."
Women, do you realize the generosity of Mrs. Pinkham's
freely offered advice ?. >.^ ;:; v J /^ ,7?-
Don't hesitate to write to Mrs.' , Pinkham. â¢ She will understand your ca
perfectly, and will, treat you with kindness... Her advice is 'free, and the
address Is Liynn, Mass. No woman ever regretted having 1 "written her, and she has
helped thousands. Her medicine, , lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Â§ Compound, is the true help "for nervoufe, sick and ailing women. It regu-
lates the monthly sickness and overcomes all those uterine derangements that
excite the nerves. This is the easy and the right way to get the help you need.
Bead the letters from the women- she has helped. .
/â¢When women are troubled .with irregularities, suppressed or
painful menstruation, weakness, indigestion, leucorrhcea, displacement
or ulceration of the womb, inflammation of the ovaries, general debility,
and nervous prostration, or are beset -with such symptoms as dizziness,
faintness, lassitude, excitability, irritability, nervousness, sleeplessness,
melancholy," all-gone" and " want-to-be-leit-alone " feelings, blues, and
hopelessness, they should remember there is one tried and true remedy.

SCETV TORK. Jan. 10.â The condition of
nÂ«Â£'.ect and crofefcElonalism Info which the

to-dcy. not enly in the smaller volume of tho
trad ine, but in the eccentric fluctuations of
prices. The n?t changes in the majority of the
list will be found narrow, but the day's range
was considerable and the changes constant and
various. The rule of operation has fallen back
to the professional room traders* basis of sell
ing on advances and buying on slight reces
t-ions. The tiieeulaiioa continued quite active

on the a&ttuif.ption that Cuban duties would be
remitted.' Manhattan was affected â¢ by realiz
ing, but was lifted at one time a point over
yertcrday. Generally speaking, the' character
istic of the market was dullness. 'due to the
lack of outside Interest and the' discontinu
sjK-e of oblations by the ' larger speculative
interests. The tone leaned toward Â¦ depression,
&s the lack of demand made the market vul
nerable to even light selling pressure. The
abandonment of the bull- campaign- in Â¦ United
States ft*cl and the deftr* to await a better
defined status of the Northern Securities , Com
pany were e^ncral considerations - detracting
from speculative interest- ThÂ«-e had been an

'CHICAGO. Jan. -10.â : As is customary Just
prior â¢ to the publication of crop reports, hold
ers felt extremely shaky over the expected
announcement of the wheat yield for 1901.
Yesterday's', market ..was depressed over the
same nervousness and when the cable list was
lower at^the opening long holders ;let go in
large quantities. The bulk of the business was
done early and was mostly on the selling side.
May opened %@%c-to %c lower at 83%c to
8314c, and then rallied on buying orders at
times, and it . was . not long before It sold at
83c.' Trade grew somewhat quiet for a time,
but continued reports of the dry, critical condi
tion of the winter wheat districts and the rumor
that the crop report would , be ;' only for the
yield per acre, leaving, traders to guess at 'the
number of acres,' brought a fair reaction. May
sold back to~S3%c -and closed steady, un
changed at 83% 83 %c. -. - ' - .
Â¦ Corn : had much ; the * same market as wheat
In sympathy- with' that' cereal. May closed a
shade higher at 66%c. ." â¢ â¢
I Oats were somewhat ' independent of the slt
: uation in the other pits, though the weakness
had a depressing effect. May closed %c lower
at 46%c.
Provisions .were dull,, but heavy, under the. In-.
fluence of a weak hog market, the grain slump
and selling of lard. May pork closed 10Â©12%c
down, lard 12%c lower and ribs 12%@15c lower.'
The leading futures, ranged as follows: â¢'."
Eggs are cheaper and going down every day.
They have probably touched their top notch
for this winter. Butter and Cheese show no

natural in view of : the fact that the â¢ price is
now more than . 50 -Â¦ per cent higher than a

"'That's grit for you,' I heard him say
as he half-staggered, more ' from eurprlso
than the blow.I guess. Then I ran, and
that's all there Is to It.
. "Once before I was robbed. It occurred
at El Paso del Norte, across the Rio
'Â¦ Grande from Â£1 Paso. There vu a bÂ»>c
fiesta In progress and I had gone over to
witness the festival. While I was stand
' In? in a, church doorway a Mexican
grabbed me and snatched a girdle from
my waist to which was attached a chate
'Â¦ lalne bag. Before I could do anything tho
! had disappeared In the crowd.
"I made up my mind then that I would
not be robbed again without mailing a
tight to save my possessions."
Her fellow employes at Goldberg, Bowen
& Co. 'a store sound praises of Miss Ste
vens -without stint.
The robbery, to which Miss Stevens re
ferred as having alarmed her was that of
Miss Ellis Brockaway. who was relieved
by a footpad on the night of November 14
of a purse containing $10 at almost the
identical spot where Miss Stevens had her
encounter. Miss Brockaway was walking
toward her residence. 763 Thirteenth
street, about 11 o'clock -when she was
stopped by a masked highwayman.
, The man arrested last night shortly
after the attempt to rob Miss Stevens
could not be identified as the footpad who
waylaid her. Â¦ Â¦

J. J. Powlirig & Co.. the firm that has
the contract to pave with bituminous reck
the roadway of Washington street. , be
tween Killmore and Steiner. came fa for
considerable censure at the hands of the
Board of Public Works at yesterday's
meeting. The matter came up on an ap
plication for an extension of thirty days
on It? contract. Commissioner Manson
was opposed to granting an Â¦extension on
the ground that contractors for public
work were becoming dilatory in carrying
out thdr contracts. The firm was finally
granted twenty days' extension with the
notification that no further extensions
wculd be granted. The board decided to
be more srringent in future in regard to

Th> future for General Funston is in
doubt. Whether he will return to Manila,
whether he Tvill be assigned to duty in
California, whether he will be sent to St.
Paul as commancer of the Department of
Minnesota, whether he will abandon the
finny for political life are ail questions
that have yet to be answered.
During his Eastern visit he expects to
submit to another operation, xvhlch will
be slight, however, and will not, it Is be
lieved, subject him to any serious Incon
venience.
The general has not definitely arranged
his plans for the Immediate future. He
Intends to enjoy a rest for several days
at leas 1 : and then make a trip to Kansas
jo visit with his parents and come of his
friends. There will also be a trip to Wash
ington, whither General Funston will go
to pay his personal respects to the Presi
dent and to the Secretary of War.
The oaptor of Aguinaldo is here on a
sixty-day furlough for rest and recupera
tion. . That leave began yesterday, and
with BO much to crowd in the two months
General Funston has to economize every
minute of his time.

Alter a restful nlsht General Frederick
Funston departed early this morning to
report his arrival from the Philippines at
army headquarters In San Francisco.
This was a matter of official duty that
could Â«iot be overlooked despite- the at
traction at the Blankart home in East
Oakland of the first born, who will soon
be christened Frederick Funston Jr.
De Boer, -who is also a native of Hol
land, and a chemist by profession, : met
Vandervelde ! In' society circles In the Isl
ands. He admitted being with Vander
velde when he stole the bicycle and knew
that he was going to commit the theft,
but said he had no hand in the act.
Geortre J. Moore, a life insurance agent,
testified that he , knew De Boer in the
Islands and that he was of 'Â» good family
and bore an excellent reputation. The
case against him was dismissed.
The Judge reduced the charge against
Vandervelde to petty larceny, of which
charge he was convicted, but sentence
was postponed for a week to enable him
to cable to his friends i In Holland for
money to, pay a fine, so that he might be
saved the disgrace of serving a term in
Jail.
thla city with $200 In my pockets I could not
get any suitable employment and . my money
soon gave out.. I was absolutely without funds
and hungry and when I saw the bicycle I
could not resist the temptation to steal It so
as to set funds with which to buy.Iood. Â¦-
â¢Reeves said that Rathbone. bad appoint
ed him chief postal accountant, but tnat
he had originally been appointed to -this
position from Washington. ' He said that
hehad a conversation .with Neely about
the destruction of. stamps.: that Neely
told him Rathbone was willing to do buhi- |
ness, and that the 'Stamps had been
burnedat the suggestion of Neely.' Mar
field did 1 not know: about \ the intended
fraud. â¢ He figured up the amount of -the
value V and marked 1 each package of
stamps, amounting, to a total of $310,000.
Reeves testified that Neely made : up a
J declaration and that some days afterward
he, Neely_and Marfleld signed n. Rath
bone, he said, ordered him to credit the
amount on the' books. â¢>Â¦ ".: â¢
Hero Senor Lanuza called attention to
; Reeves', statement on Assistant Postmas
! ter Bristow's report that Reeves had not
known fraud had been committed when he '
made the credit in the books. I Beeves said
! that before burning the last aurchargcti
stamps, amounting to $68,000, Neely told
him that the amount credited for the first
burning was wrong-, and that'there was
$15,000 to be divided up : between him;
Neely and Rathbone. Reeves testified that.
Neely told him that Rathbone had paid
off a mortgage in Cincinnati with this
money. . Â¦ . . .
Shortly after- this Reeves said that
Rathbone in referring to the burning -of
the stamps said that it was an easy way
to make money. He alsoisaldrthat Neely
told him that Rathbone would be civil
Governor of ; Cuba -and that they, would
I benefit thereby, because Neely. would .. be
Treasurer of the Island and Reeves Aud
itor. Reeves also, testified' that Neely had
credited $12,000 to his own department in
changing accounts to the North American
Trust Company, and that he, Neely,. had
appropriated this amount.
| Regarding Rathbone's trip. to the United
â¢ States in October, 1899, Reeves said that
- $1500 had been drawn for expense, and
Â¦ Rathbone returned him $673. He said that
; he thought Neely gave Rathbone- $480 of
; this amount, and that Neely said .that
I Rathbone was hard up and. that be would
j return it when he got an' increase of sal
| ary. . . ' 'Â¦'... , v Â¦' ; Â¦ - s y. .
'' When the question of daily expense ai
; lowance came up Reeves testified that he
: told Rathbone that in the absence of any
â¢ instructions discontinuing - this allowanc
lie should continue it when Neely went
<to the United States. Reeves said further
; that just before his arrest Neely : left an
! envelope containing : $4600 upon his
i (Reeves') desk, telling- him to fir. up the
j accounts. ; Reeves said he afterward gave
: this money to General Wood, telling, him
i that Neely had been stealing. .' ".; . , r .
. The Government' has finished, the exam-'
ination ; of Reeves and to-morrow, he will
be 'cross-examined by for Neely
and Rathbone. It was Â«n-ldent throughout
Reeves' testimony that the charge against
all the defendants is based on Reeves'
statements,' for the fiscal Â¦; conducted v. hi?
examination question by question i from i a
typewritten copy of the accusation and
Reeves' testimony substantiated Â¦ the con

POSTTJM CEREAL.
BUILT A MONUMENT.
The Best Sort in the World.
"A monument built by and from Pos-
tum' is the way Mr. J. G. Casey of Ayers,
111., describes himself. He says: "For
5*eara I was a coffee drinker until at last
I became a terrible sufferer from dyspep-
sia, constipation, headaches and indiges-
tion, and was a physical wreck.
"Tlie different kinds <it medicines I tried
did not cure me. but finally some one told
me 3: must leave off coffee and take up
Postam Food Coffee. I was fortunate In
having the new coffee made strictly ac-
cording to directions, so that from the
start 1 liked It. It has a rich flavor and I
made the change from coffee to Postum
without any trouble.
"Gradually my condition changed. The
old troubles disappeared and I began to
get well again. My appetite became good
and I could digest food. Now I have been
restored to strength and health. Can sleep
sounl all night and awake with a fresh
and rested body. Everyone who meets me
comments on my getting so fat and rosy.
"I am really a monument built by Pos-
tum, for I was a physical wreck, dis-
tressed In body and mind, and am now a
strorg, healthy man. I know exactly what
made the change; it was leaving off coffee
and usinsr Poitum."

Symphony Concert Or
chestra Acquits Itself
Â¦ An excellent programme, finely ren
dered; a large audience! and great enthu
siasm form the tale of yesterday after
noon's symphony concert at the '.Grand
Opera-house. The audience was consid
erably larger than at the first concert an-1
highly appreciative of the admirable work
of the orchestra and its leader, rto which
that done at the first concert cannot for.
a. moment be compared. Whether It -was
the reaction of (the sympathy of the lis
teners, an orchestral mood, , or simply the
greater freedom and authority of Â¦ Mr.
Steindorff 's baton, the . whole : atmosphere
of the work was different from the first
effort of . the orchestra and . insomuch as
it differed from excelled it. . â¢ Leader, or
chestra and audience wakened up and tne
programme, went throughout .with spirit
and life. . < â¢. : : .'' Â¦ Kv'-
The "Fest Overture," a somewhat pon
derous but picturesque movement by Las
sen, opened the programme 'and received
a broad and colorful interpretation. â¢ The
second number, the "Fi-eislled"; from "Die
Meistersinger,' ' was given with grace : and
breadth, but Jacked a little in color. .Its
always lovely melody, thaUWilhelmj has
so well woven In through his arrangement
of the Prize Song, was greeted with mucn
pleasure by the audience. . J: The Mendels
sohn "Scherzo" . from i the VMIdsummer
Night's Dream"' followed, and .-its light
and spirited interpretation -t drew.; an in
sistent encore. Mr. " Steindorff sacriflceti
speed to 'clarity -a -little in- the number;
but, considering. the youth of the orches
tra, the rapidity, precision and balance of
the work done was quite wonderful. -The
movement : was -repeated, amid much- en
thusiasm.'..
Then came . the â¢ star . attraction of ,: the
afternoon I in the Â¦ Beethoven - Symphony in
C minor. â¢ Here the orchestra did its best
and worst , work. Particularly/ good -was
the -"Scherzo," Â¦ that had" evidently-"; been
very thoroughly- rehearsed,"- going .with
fine rhythmic swing , and ease. . The whole
symphony was interpreted with a satisfy
ing breadth and intelligence, .its 2 noble
sanity and lucid,- logical beauty I arousing
the best that leader and men had to -give.
The Andante . dragged somewhat,^ Its leis
ureliness becoming . apathy, in . places, ; and
there was ; not . always ' the r tonal - beauty
to- compensate. .The other : two - move
ments, the Allegro con brio land finalei"
went excellently,- and one can predict th^at
with greater experience " and sufficient * re

Our respected Civil Commission has Juggled
so with the currency â¢ of . the lslanda that now
the question seems Impossible of solution. Some
little time ago the Filipino peso was at a pre
mium In Hongkong. This drained the city of
Manila 'of silver currency. The Civil Commis
sion then placed a tax on all silver exported
from the islands. The result of this act vaa
not foreseen by the commission: r ."United States
money decreased In value and the Mexican dol
lar Is now worth 60 cents gold. It Is needless
to state that the banks of ; Manila are taking
advantage of this. A twenty-dollar gold piece
is worth from ?42S6 Mexican to flS Mexican
in Hongkong, so that all gold is being shipped
from the Philippines to China. Now we find
Manila flooded with Mexican silver, and United
States gold â¢ at ar> : outrageous premium. The
banks are reaping a harvest, and it Is , up to
somebody to suggest a scheme to straighten out
the currency tangle In the Philippines.
The Philippines hold out no. inducements to
those seeking positions, or ; to those of Â¦ small
capital. The cost of living in the islands is
very 'great. Though one â¢ may receive a
good salary, one is compelled to part with mosi
of it" to supply. the meager. necessities of life.
Currency: in a Tangle.
The principal agricultural products are rice,
the staple food of the people, cultivated In
most of the provinces; coffee, cacao and sugar
cane, raised: in some of the islands;. tobacco of
an inferior quality, ; hemp, indigo, cocoanuta,
bananas and other products of less Importance.
The agricultural possibilities are by far moro
Inviting to investors than are any of the other
industries o' the islands.
As yet very . little is known concerning the
mineral wealth of the PhlliDplnes. - A number
of prominent mining men, who have prospected
In many parts of the Islands, claim that very
little gold will be found. -
The resources of the Philippines have ' been
greatly overestimated. Many varieties of hard
woods are found there, but not In great forests,
as In 'California and elsewhere. -The different
varieties of trees are so mixed that it ia a
question whether or not this industry will prove
a safe investment for American capital.
A few Filipinos of prominence have taken the
oath of allegiance, but have done so simply to
further their, own personal Interests. It ia a
standing joke among 'American residents of
Manila that the Philippines Civil Commission
seems to take a keen delight In promoting rev
olutionary natives to high public offices. Aa
an example: . A native member of the Civil
Commission owns and controls one of the great
est evils in the Philippines, namely:' the dlstil
ing of vino, a native drink that is fast ruin
ing the Filipino people. - Â¦ This Commissioner
also : owns in the . neighborhood * ot 200 retail
shops where vino is sold to natives and Ameri
can soldiers. It can readily be seen why this
official stands l ever ready to salute the Stars
and . Stripes and to stng "The Star-Spangled
Banner" in broken English. .'
Revolutionists Promoted.
The Filipinos hate America and -the Ameri
cans. These little dark men .will resist Ameri
can occupation to the bitter end. Exhaustive
reports by both army and civil officials are
continually being made to the effect that the
islands are. nearing a state oi complete pacifi
cation. Such reports are made merely to de-.
ceive the people in the United Statea. If ths
Philippines are all but pacified, why do bands
of lad rones Infest every island of the group?
Why Is- guerrilla warfare being carried on la
many parts of the islands?
; Every one of the islands of the Philippine
Archipelago is a white elephant on the hands
of the . United States Government. The total
number of white elephants amounts to about
1400. What our Government will do with this
gigantic sideshpw Is a question as yet unsolved
by even those worthy officials who have been
sent to the Philippines as keepers and trainers
of Uncle Sam's great show. ,

Sacramento to head off the pair
forcibly take the money the woman col
lected. The friend of the duped China
man failed to meet the couple, and he
at once telegraphed to Wing advising him
to inform tne police. Learning " that Â¦ the
"Queen" and her consort were- on their
way to the north intending to board a
steamer bound for China, Wing decided
to swear out a warrant for her arrest.

in abolishing the transport service .we .want
to be sure that the business will not go from

It will help : to ' build up the commerce of

Philippine Islands, the Government , has sent
an enormoua quantity of freight over there
and- there has been a large demand for goodd
of aU kinds through commercial channels. The
only way \we could ship goods was via Hong
kong, from which Â¦ point reshipment was Â¦ re-,
quired to Manila. On the regular lines run :
ning from, San ' Francisco to the Orient, mer
chandise coming via the : railroad : had .:. the
preference and . it was impossible at times to

George W./McNear, in giving: his views
on the broposed sale of the transports,
said: f - Â¦<â¢: Â¦, . â¢-Â¦Â¦â¢. '-
Â¦ When we went* to Washington we were very
careful , to avoid mentioning the name : of ; any
private steamship line or company. We went
.there for ; the ; purpose of securing some of ; the
Government business between this port and, the
Philippines for Pacific Coast lines. .; As long as
the Government : was in tne transport 1 business
it was not possible for private concerns to run
a 'direct line between San Francisco and. Ma
nila. . WClth the guarantee of some of. the Gov
renment freight it would be an inducement for
capitalists to Invest in that direction. I think
the: proposed sale of/ the transports is a good
step.. I am satisfied. that the capital will be
forthcoming to establish a line from this city
capable of handling all the Government busi
ness and that of the commercial community. ; I
don't i think there is the slightest danger that
the. transport business will be diverted to Pu
get Sound and certainly not to New York. The
supplies, of forage and flour for the army must
be shipped from the Pacific Coast. - ' :

Action of Congress.
.WASHINGTON; . Jan. 10.â New York
capital Is deeply interested In the move
ment'inaugurated by the Pacific Mall
Steamship Company and the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company | for the abolition of
the; army transport' service. Representa
tives of the Pacific Mail Company are now
in, Washington 'and agents of the Pacific
Coast Company are expected here \ in a
few days. .'These gentlemen will immedi
ately apply pressure to the administration
and to Congress: for, the purpose of stop
ping, the â¢ transportation r of Â¦ troops and
army freight in transports
and the transfer of this business to pri
vate steamships. â¢ - \
Secretary Root has indicated that he Is
in favor of such action the moment Con
gress passes a law authorizing the grant
ing of American charters to twenty- three
transports now owned by the Government.
When given American charters these
ships! will bring a high price, but if sold
under their present charters the Govern
ment will not receive their value for them.
-; It is claimed by opponents of the army
transport' service. that it Is operated at a
much greater expense than is necessary
and; that transportation of soldiers and
freight can be done cheaper by private
lines. -Moreover, the advisability - of en
larging American trade with the Orient
and encouraging private ship-building en
terprises are advanced as strong reasons
for the \ transportation of troops . and
freight by private firms.
Government transports cannot carry a
pound of private ; freight to Â¦ the Philip
pines unless by direct consent of the "War
Department. ' Â¦ '. _. .- . -.
Officials of the War Department explain
that the reason why: private steamship
lines will be able to handle Government
business cheaper than the transport ser
vice Is that they, employ Chinese for their
crews and junior officers.' "White labor is
employed upon 'Government transports.
vThe crew of a Pacific Mail. steamer re
ceives an average of $7 50 per month. On
transports men receive pay usually given
to white sailors.
In his estimates for- the expenses of the
army during the next fiscal year Secre
tary Root, upon recommendation of Quar
termaster General Ludlngrton, submitted
an item of $34,000,000. for cost of transpor
tation of. troops.. -. â¢ -
Most of .this sum was to meet the ex
penses of : the, transport service.' It is
stated that. the comparison of the cost of
transporting officers and men to Cuba by
private steamers and the expense of
transporting them in Government vessels
shows that the former method is cheaper.'
The same result. It? is- predicted -will be
obtained from the use of private ships on
the .Pacific.^ Â¦Â¦:':â¢ . .Â¦ v . Â¦
