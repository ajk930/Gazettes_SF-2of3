Reed "raised the point that it was not'offi-'

"I was informed by the City Attorney's

date when, the new officials took their

he would give an opinion on the question

Says Opinion Is Not Official.
"By what authority has the Mayor act
ed upon the' matter?" asked Reed. ".The
Mayor as president of this board cannot
act unless the board has authorized him
to do so. Let us have the record. Who
asked for the opinion?"
"There Is a difference of opinion on that
point," said Ruef, "and for that reason
we make, a formal demand that the in
coming, officials be seated."
"If there is no objection," said,. Mayor
Pheian. "the clerk will note that- all the
Supervisors-elect have made demands for
their seats. Acting on the advice of the

mand. His Honor then adjourned the
meeting: until this afternoon. Reed moved
to make the adjournment sine die, but
wa s frowned down by the Mayor, who :
was supported by the board in his ruling.
Other Officials Make Demands.
Only a limited number of San Fran
cis:Â» f s city officials rested easily on their
thrones yesterday. It was expected that
the newly elected officials would take !
office, but City and County Attorney Lane
decreed otherwise. In consequence there
was more cr less friction. The officials
who were to succeed the incumbents
made demands for" their offices in order
to protect their legal rights, but none of I
tntm stepped into- the places to which i
they were elected.
When business opened In the Treasur
er's office in the morning- John E. Mc-
Dougald. the TreaÂ«urer-elect, accom
panied by Attorneys Riordan and Devoto, i
made a formal demand for the transfer of !
the moneys to his custody. Treasurer 1
Brooke refused. At noontime the same '
demand, was made, with a like result.
To-morrow morning: the city treasury will
be closed in order that the formal trans
fer may be made as soon as the cash is
counted.
At the Tax Collector's office Edward J.
Smith, accompanied by James Simpson,
Ms chief deputy, and Daniel E. Besecker,
his cashier, called upon J. Harry Scott
an i talked over the situation. They de
cided that as the formal demand had been
made matters might be allowed to rest
until to-morrow at 8:30 o'clock, at which
time the clerks in the office have been
requested to be on hand and learn their
fate.
Harry Baehr, the Auditor-elect, also
called upon Auditor "Wells and they hart a
nice pleasant talk. Baehr said he thought
it was the proper day for him to begin
writing his signature on city warrants,
but "Wells thought differently. So the
xm.tter was compromised by Baehr agree
ing: to wait until the rest went into office.
County Clerk A. B. Mahohy. called
upon County Clerk Deane and talked
nu-tters over. Deane suggested that Ma
hony might put a man into the office to
countersign papers that were tiled, but
aft/er some discussion it was decided ' to
abide by the decision of the City and
County Attorney.
l*he only officers who were not dis
turbed by the decision of the City and
County Attorney were the Sheriff, Re
corder, City and County Attorney and the
Supervisors who were re-elected.

clew. Smith was found lying on his
back, his hat upon his face and a six
shooter in his band, which lay across his
boÂ£y. It was believed at first that he
had committed suicide, but upon examin

there were no powder .burns, and an in

haci been hit by a hammer, probably
after the snot was fired.

The steamer remained above water, 1 think
about half an hour, but the fog was so denso
we were out of sight of her when she sank
Captain Hall was the last to leave the steamer
She carried him down, but by means of his life
preserver he managed to reach a raft and was
afterward rescued, it was a rough sea at the
time and many of the small boats. I have no
doubt, could not keep abreast of it. We were
fortunate In not seeing any drowning person*.

I was in the steerage with at least forty
others when the shock came about i o'clock In
the morning. We did not need to have any one
tell us that something terrible had happened
The cries and screams of the women and chil
dren were sounds I never can forget, so dread
ful were they to me. The first .boats lowered
were mostly filled with women and children,
but I obtained a place in one of the first to
carry men. All had on Ufa preservers and

we had our hands full looking after our

NO more of the missing from the
ill-fated steamerâ Walla- -Walla
have been reported safe. The
death list still bears their names
and relatives mourn their loss.
The captain of the French bark Max de
clares he did not forsake the passengers
of the Eteamship: He stated yesterday
that the "Walla Walla was going at such
great speed'thatvwhfin. the .vessels struck
she continued on her crfurse and; 'was
quickly out of sight. ,-He .says Â¦ further
that/ awakened from sleep,'-he rushed on
deck and after finding out -the extent of
the damage to his ship, had the vessel
put about and stayed in the vicinity un
til noon the next day. He even -.says he
ordered rockets sent into the air and haa
lanterns hoisted in the rigging. _' "
Mariners claim that the Walla Walla
went down a sacrifice to the safety . of
the Max. They declare that Captain
Benoist was off his course and that had
he continued without meeting with an ob
stacle the bark would have gone ashore.
Yesterday morning Captain Hall and
his fellow-offlcers on the lost steamship
were closeted with Edwin Goodall and
other officials of the Pacific Coast Steam

McD. Llngum, a quartermaster on the
Walla Walla, was also given up as lost.
He was among the last to leave, the ship,
and yesterday appeared on the front to
let his ' friends ' know that he was alive.
His story of the disaster does not differ,
from that of â¢ the passengers and other
members of- the crew. He said:
other side to that question. A sailing ship
has the right of way according to the rules
of .the road, granted; but when a sailing ship
sees .that a collision is inevitable the rule. of
the road says he must up helm and .'bout ship.
"Now the Max could easily have got out of

-Â¦WASHINGTON, Jan., 6.â Senator Lodg*.
chairman of the Committee on the Philip
pines... to-morrow will Introduce a bill for
a .temporary government of the Philip
pines, drafted -after many consultations
{â¢with the "War Department, which la dl
' recfly Interested In Insular, affairs and the
. government of tKe Philippines. The bill
(will not<be a part of the Philippine reve
nue bill, which has passed the House, but
will be an 'independent measure. The bill
does not attempt to ..establish a new form
! of government in' the Philippines* but con
| firms, thfc action of President McKtnley in
creating a commission and" ratines the
acts of '.that commission under the in
' structlons of 'the President, â¢ dated April
7. 1S00. It also gives the President author
â¢ ity while there is frrmed resistance In any
part of the islands to the United States
to regulate and control interlsland com
merce. Section four, following the Portu
Rican act, I gives the .government of the
; Philippines power to Improve the harbors
: and other instruments of commerce, ana
section five, also following the Porto
: Rican act, turns over to the government
; of the Philippines all lands devoted now
' to public use. bridges, highways, etc.
Under section six the government of the
I Philippines is empowered to make rules
* and regulations for the disposition of pub
> lie lands other than timber and mineral
i lands, such regulations to have the force
and effect of law only after they have
i been approved by the President and Con
gress. Then follows a series of, provisions
to enable the commission to perfect the
. titles of persons now occupying public
, lands, and to lease and sell lands to such
persons or. give them to occupants with
out compensation.. This Is to provide for
{the small native landholders who are oc-
I cupying" and for a long time have occupied
I public lands, but who: have no titles to
| protect them In their holdings,
! Next come provisions in regard to thÂ©
_L.tlmber. lands,_ which are not to be sold or
: leased by the commission, who have pow
er only to issue licenses to cut timber un-
I der the: forestry regulations now in force
Tin the islands. The provisions in regard
to. the timber lands are followed by a
number of sections as to mineral lands.
These are very elaborate and embody the
mineral laws embraced within the report
I of -the "commission and whfch have been
i prepared by them with great care, so that
I they shall be in harmony: with the exist
| ing Spanish laws. The mineral land sec
i tions cover also coal lands and saline
| lands.: '.â¢Â¦"Â¦ * Â¦
One of the most important . provisions in
! the bill is that empowering the Philippine
I] Commission to purchase" the lands of the
religious orders and; dispose of them on
proper terms to the actual occupants. An
appeal Jrom the -Supreme Court of the
; Islands to the Supreme 'Court of the
States is provided Jn certain cases.
T Municipalities and the city of Manila are
,, authorized to borrow money and to issue
bonds for-money for improvements. Thero
are two, sections which provide for the
granting of franchises, so that individuals
or' corporations can go into the island3
and construct electric and steam railroads
and engage in industries and manufac
tures. The granting of franchises is safe
guarded by provisions based on the cor
poration laws of Massachusetts.
Provisions are embodied for establishing
a coinage system 6n the lines of Special
Agent Conanfs report. The final sections
of the bill make provision for a banking?
system, and authorize banks of the
United States to be established in the
Philippines. Â¦. ,
discuss the wreck, beyond admitting that
they had been passengers on the Walla
vvalla, had been picked up by the Dis
patch while floating on a-life raft and
had shipped as seamen on the latter ves
sel through their anxiety to reach Seattle.
Captain Johnson talks modestly of the
part he took In the rescue work. He says
Captain Hall of the Walla Walla was
almost unconscious when picked up.
When Captain Hall recovered his first
request was that Johnson continue h's
search for the missing-.
"Captain, there are more of them out
there," he exclaimed. "For God's sak<Â»
go out and find them."
Later Captain Hall demanded to know
if one of his boatswains had been picked
up.
"If he's on board this boat." said Cap
tain Hall, "I'm going to kill him. H*
Bhall not live after what he has done."
The captain then related to .Johnson
that he had ordered the * boatswain to
command one of the lifeboats, and that
the boatswain, with a few of the crew,
had deliberately pulled away from tha
Walla Walla and made no attempt to
rescue any of the helpless passengers.
Captain Johnson expresses the greatest
admiration- for the, conduct of Captain
Hall, and condemns In vigorous terms the
action of some of the members of the
Walla Walla's crew. In the boats and
rafts which the Dispatch picked up.
Johnson says, the seamen Â¦ and firemen
had been showing: not the least consid
eration for the passengers, thinking only
of themselves.
He cites one case of an old woman who
was taken from a boat, along with a
flunky from the Walla Walla. The flunky
persisted In telling the woman that he
had saved her life and finally extorted
from her the little purse which she car
ried, containing about $6.

Sickness is the worst enemy of the work-

The use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Med-

Vallejo Welcomes Visitors.
The convention opened this morning
with an attendance of more than two
hundred -delegates. The majority arrived
here on the steamer Montlcello, which
made a special trip from San Francisco.
The visitors were given a warm reception
by the residents of Vallejo, and rr.any
of the stores displayed flags and bunt
ing and union mottoes.
The convention was called to order In
Samoset Hall, which was tastefully dec
orated with American flags. President
C. D. Rodgers of the State Federation of
Labor â¢Â¦ was giren an - ovation. He was
very brief In his opening remarks,' and
was followed by W. T. Kelley, president
of the Board of Trustees of the city of
Vallejo, who, in the name of the resi
dents of this city, gave welcome and
greeting to the Â¦ representatives of the
labor organizations. v
The first important business - of the
session was the appointment of a commit
tee on credentials. The motion that the
committee be appointed aroused a slight
discussion when . the delegates of the
Iron Trades Council demanded that they
have one representative on the commit
tee. The demand was not supported and
President Rodgers was authorized to se
lect the committee.. He named the ' fol
lowing members of the Labor Council to
serve: E. H. Lloyd, Loa Angeles;iMi

VAL.LEJO. Jan. 6.â The convention
cf iJie State Federation of Labor. \
which opened here this morning; j
promises to be prolific In devel-.j
opments of importance to the
wcrkingmen of California. Although
many assertions have been made that the
convention would make a radical change
in Its constitution and launch forth bold
ly as a political gathering, these state
ments are vigorously denied by the offi
cers of th'i federation. President Rod
gers, in discussing the work to be done,
said:
We are gathered here for the express purpose
cf harmonizing: the labor unions and to bring
all of them into closer relations.
It Is on!y .le a unit that the unions can suc
ceed in Euch steps as w* feel are necessary to
the welfare of unionism. At far as I am con
cerned there will be no politic* In the con
vection. The constitutions of the American and
State Federations of Labor distinctly prohibit
the discussion of partisan politics In any con
vention. They allow thÂ« " Indorsement or dis
approval of tjiy act or acts of a political party
or legislator:!, but we cannot take any such
steps as would place us In the category of po
etical parties. I shaU strictly interpret the
constitution .-ind will not allow partisan politics
to be dlscus8<$d unless the convention decides by
vote to <Jo to, which is most unlikely.
There has been no particular programme out
lined for this convention, but most important
matters are to be brought up. Perhaps the
subject of giÂ«ateet moment Is that of the ex
clusion of Chinese from the United States.

which decided the ownership of thousands

Â¦Robert- Williams: , Each .line-is trying to
complete its j| work before \ the , other, .to
gain contracts for - hauling Republic ore
to the Grand Forks smelter.
-Holland and Williams have been nego
tiating for a month with the owners of
the mining claims , f or permits allowing
their respective lines to run through. this
property. The " mine-owners were afraid
of oifending either .company, so they de

"Holland arrived four hours ahead. The

several miles from his goal and his deed,,
therefore, became worthless..:
the objection to our union being "repre

had misstated facts. * . . Â¦ . \ .. :.
"It: is not true,", said Westerby, "that

and 1 can prove it.'" -
A heated debate . between "Westerby and
Case followed, -the lie being passed to

of San Francisco moved that- a' regular
committee of five be appointed to inves

men . of the Shipwrights' and Â¦ Caikers'
Union as a lot of "scabs" and declared
that Delegate Case should be thrown out
of the hall. Many delegates advised calm
action and that a spirit of brotherhood
should be shown. < They deprecated hasty
action.' A flood of motions,, amendments,

Vulcan Smelting & Refining Co. ,
We have Just completed a very successful
run in the 50-ton furnace sold to us' by your
company on a mixed carbonate and sulphide ore,
and turned out a 96 per cent copper bullion;
carrying the gold and silver values, with a
loss of less than three-quarters of 1 per cent
of copper in the slag, which, as you are aware,
is remarkably low in the smelting of carbonate
ores. The furnace is all right,- - -it ' s a
wizard. We would have been very glad to ten-
der you this testimonial before, but desired
to make the run entirely with our own force,
separate from the operation of same Â¦ by ~ your
force sent here to blow furnace in.
We find that our 30 H. P. boiler is ample, to.
operate furnace in a most satisfactory manner .:â¢
We also find that your statements regarding
the smelter have not been exaggerated at all,
and that the operation of the furnace is en-
tirely as represented, and is a complete suc-
cess, and will within the near future place
with the Vulcan Company an order for a 100- ton
plant, which we will install at Lordsburg

made no secret of these transactions, and
that Neely's Â¦ clerk received this money
when Neely was not present.

.TAUNTON, Mass., Jan. . 6.-Harry
Townsend, cashier of the Bristol County
National Bank, it is reported, is $35,000
short in his accounts, the deficit having
been found to-night by" Bank Examiner
Ewer. The deficit is said to have been
due to speculation in cotton futures.
Townsend is under the eye of a United
States officer until the bank's affairs are
further investigated. The bank haa a
capitalization of $500,000. and according to
its December statement, the surplus was
$150,000 and the undivided profits $53,000.
One of the directors said to-nicht that
$35,000 is the outside figure of the defalca
tion and that the bank's surplus will
amply protect all Interests. The director
said also that when the irregularities were
called to Townsend's attention he ad-'
mltt'ed that he was short in his accounts
to the amount stated.. Townsend had
worked in the bank since he left school,
some twenty-live years ago. One of the
directors said that apparently the defal
cation-had been going on for two years
and that Townsend admitted this. The
figures found wrong were in balances with
all corresponding banks, presumably in
New York and Boston.

sticking to the Nicaragua route, for the
House has already expressed a decided
preference. I firmly believe that when
the Panama proposition is thoroughly an
alyzed and its results known there will
be no trouble -between the Senate and the
House In agreeing on a bill ; which pro
vides for the Nicaragua route. . : -
A majority of the Senate Committee
on Interoceanic Canals can be safely
counted on by friends of the Nicaragua
route. All of the Democratic members
favor Nicaragua. They are Morgan, Cul
berson, Harris and Turner. Senators
Hawley and Platt of New York are also
in- favor of Nicaragua. It - is â¢ presumed
that Senators Hanna, Mitchell. Kittridge,
Millard and Pritchard will be with the
majority when the issue comes.

nothing "the company can sell. This is

The Secretary concludes his letter with
an extract from the report of the Audi
tor of the Treasury for the Navy Depart
ment, showing the "status of the- prize
money and bounty cases yet unsettled,
owing to delays in. the courts; and pre
dicting a settlement- within the year.
On this point the Secretary says the de
partment itself was the first to realize
the inequalities of this law and to make
the recommendation which led to" its re
peal, so that "a rather amusing feature
cf the attacks made upon:. the Navy. De
partment is ' that Â¦ the j administration is
blamed more than two. years after it had
cured the evil." , .
As comniander-in-chief . Admiral . Sampson
would, therefore, under the law, have been en
titled to his share of the bounty, for the de
struction of the Spanish ships at Santiago if
he had- been on the north shore of Cuba at the
time. This was the law, for which the Navy
Department is in nowise responsible. . â¢ Â¦;. " Â¦. j
Touching' the' claim of Admiral Samp
son for bounty at Santiago, the-Secre
tary says that. the distribution was made
under a decree of Â¦ the Court of Claims,
which he cites, and from which no ap
peal was taken. He further points put
that, under the prize laws, the comman
der-in-chief of the fleet Is entitled to "one
twentieth" of the bounty by virtue of his
position as commander-in-chief , . whether
he is personally present during the en
gagement or not. Says the. Secretary:
The Secretary . declares that the criti
cism that the department has discrimi
nated in favor of Admiral Sampson and
against Admiral Schley in the distribu
tion of prize money and bounty is unjust;
because the department has no' control
over the matter, the money being distrib
uted from the treasury, and all questions
of law and fact relative to prize and
bounty having been determined by thÂ«
courts. The Secretary calBs â¢ attention to
the laws touching prize and bounty as
they existed at the beginning of the
Spanish war, and says that, though ad
vised by the Attorney General that it
might make a' distribution, the' Navy De
partment preferred to place . the matter
in the Court of Claims, and so far from
displaying . favoritism adopted -the .most
effective means in its power to secure a
just determination by courts of law od
the rights of all concerned.. Â¦ â¢ ; . .

furnish to the board whatever information

tempt at bribery in order that, if such an
attempt had -been 1 made.- prosecution of
the offenders may be instituted.
I do not ; know whether these charges pub

after r investigation,', you . find them true, the
guilty one ought to be indicted and to receive

the other hand, you.- after Investigation, shall
find s them wholly unsupported in fact, then
those who gave - currency to such ' baseless yet
serious charges should.be held up to the com

Many. foreign soldiers and a few officers
to-day violated the Government's request
to keep off the streets, which have been
cleaned, and decorated for the royal pro
cession.' This is likely to create resent

The, foreigners are divided into two fac
tions concerning the future relations of

ing that -the relations should be limited
to the fulfillment of 'the most formal ob

that in official i and social relations the
Ministers should endeavor to be morÂ« in
timate with the court than formerly and
should meet all Chinese advances in the
most friendly spirit.
' The : families of. the- foreign diplomats
will occupy the, buildings which the Chi
nese Government has tendered them for
the purpose of viewing the parade. There
is ; much- criticism of this, course: among
the foreigners, who are not satisfied with
the fact that the Ministers alone are to
remain in the legation. They believe that
the event should be complet^y ignored.
They say that the presence of any mem

as. being a sortyof homage to the court

The production of American sugar up to the point
of an exportable surplus is of as great importance to
:his country as the same production of iron, steel,
machinery, meat and flour. >It concerns the welfare
)l millions of our own people, and has the advan
sige of having economics and sentiment on its side.
The proposition rests upon no economic argu
nent that does not apply, with equal force to manu
sictures. The sentimental argument, that we owe
iirrs to Cuba, has no force worthy of the respect of
Z'ongress.
With such a prospect no one need marvel that
American sugar interests stand inflexibly against the
schemes of the Cuban junta for invasion of our mar
ket with the free raw sugar from that island. If
such an attack were being made upon any American
manufacturing industry the resentment would be or
ganized, quick, sharp and decisive.
In considering all plans for irrigation of our arid
ands their profitable use when brought into action
rust not be lost sight of. Already at Provo, in
Ctah, and in the valley of the Arkansas, in Colo
rado, the sugar beet is domesticated as a regular
:~op and the mills are in action to work it into sugar.
At Greeley, Colo., another mill is proposed, and
:here are lands in the Snake River Valley, Idaho, and
ir. Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico, which will be
iound suited to this crop when irrigated. The utility
jf the sugar beet as an addition to the farm crops of
California is an established demonstration, and the
:ime is not distant when the country will look to the
iesert for its sweets.
It is of special interest to the West that the sugar
biet promises to become a stable crop on the irri
gated lands of the arid region. The plant requires
i period of ripening after its growth has ceased.
This is exactly like the ripening of fruit. It is the
:ime of chemical change which produces the sugar.
In non-arid countries if rain fall at this period in the
ii'e of the beet a renewal of growth is induced, which
irrests the development of sugar. Where moisture
Is supplied entirely by irrigation the vrater is ex
rluded at this point and the ripening process goes on
anchecked. " ,' r ;.C;
(<â^ ERMANY is far from being a tropical coun
-_- try, but it is the largest sugar-producing
s â^ country in the world. The United States
last year took from Europe, principallj' from Ger
tr;an3 r , 400,000 tons of raw sugar. Even Russia since
i38o has produced beet sugar in excess of her do
mestic need and has become an exporter. The sugar
bret produced in the United States has a larger sac
rliarine content and value than any other, showing
our physical capacity to produce beyond our own
demand and to add sugar to our exportable agricul
:ural surplus. We are now paying nearly $100,000,
>X) a j-ear for foreign sugar, and that sum added to
:hc profits of our o;vn agriculture will perceptibly
improve the situation of the American farmer.

trade we find the same issue confronting us. We do
not possess our rightful share of the trade even of the
American states to the south of us because we have
not the shipping facilities of our competitors. Great
as has been our advance in industry and pur success
in the markets of the world, it would. have been

ocean transportation. In the future we shall be even

upbuilding the American merchant marine has come.
The shipping bill, which Congress has so. often' neg

, No intelligent -man can reflect upon those facts
without perceiving the well nigh imperative need of
upbuilding the American merchant. marine upon the
ocean. The issue has been before the country for a
long time and every, year has found it more serious
than the preceding year. At the present time it is
something like an emergency issue, for, we are now

eager to obtain it. They have not hesitated to grant
liberal subsidies to the merchant marine that is neces
sary to carry on the trade. If we stand idle at this^
juncture we will enable our European rivals to gain
a prestige in the Chinese market which it will be
difficult for us to overcome at a later time.
With this increasing trade, however, there comes
an increasing demand for merchant steamers to
handle it. At present we, are in the main dependent
upon- foreign ship9 to' carry our goods to market and
to bring back such goods as we continue to import.
The result is that every advance in our foreign trade
imposes upon us the necessity of paying an increased
tribute to foreign ship-owners. It also subjects our
trade to heavy losses whenever for any reason there
is a diminution in the supply of "foreign shiiJs. The
far-off war in South Africa, for example, inflicted a
loss upon the American people by withdrawing from
the Atlantic trade a considerable number of British
ships, for use. in transporting troops and supplies to
the seat of war, and ic is easy to foresee that should a
great war break out in Europe, involving nations
whose merchant marine. is now an important factor
in- ocean transportation, our trade would be seriously
curtailed or hampered and every important industry
in the country would be injured.'.
OUR international trade has .now reached a
magnitude that compels serious attention to
the problem of transporting it. The value of
our wealth is estimated to exceed that of any other
nation by upward of $104,000,000,000. We have
passed Germany and Great Britain in the value of our
exports. We produce the great staples of trade, such'
as iron, coal, wheat, corn, meat, cotton arid fruit,
more abundantly than any other people. Our in
creasing export of manufactured goods has been the'
marvel and the despair of the nations of Europe.
During the last fiscal "year the balance of trade in
our favor was $664,900,000. In every line of industry
the output is increasing/ Our shipments to foreign'
markets augment with each succeeding year, and we'
can look forward to an assured industrial and com-'
mercial supremacy over all competitors.
OUR TRADE PROBLEM.
It is said that both the King of England and "the:
King of Italy have expressed a willingness to deco-
rate Marconi with medals of honor, but the young
inventor has been too busy to accept. However, as
he was not too busy to win an American girl, there
is no reason to fear he is overworking himself. 'Â¦Â¦
It is probably true that they do not represent the
views of. all who are interested in the object they are
intended to advance. But it is also true that no
measure can be framed to meet such a variety of
plans as have been proposed. If all differences can
be merged in this easiest and most reasonable means
for effecting the object which all have sought to pro
mote, these bills may be passed at the present session
and the work of storing and distributing water may
soon begin. It is a plain business proposition to
use for such purpose the lands to be improved by it
rather than resort to taxation for such purpose.
These two bills would seem to provide an ideal
system. The grazing lands, now being rapidly dis
used by the extirpation of their forage caused by
overstocking, would be protected and their carrying
capacity increased, while their fitness for homestead
settlement would be enhanced through the restora
tion- of moisture, which is now declining, as the land
is stripped of its vegetable cover. The whole domain
would yield income for irrigation while unsold, and
when sold its price would go into a permanent re
volving fund for the same purpose. These measures
are of such vast economic importance to the West
as to seem deserving" of the support of all who are
interested in the development of the country.
This bill requires that freeholders shall have first
preference to lease public lands abutting upon their
freeholds for use of their domestic stock and to protect
them from being eaten out by wandering flocks and
herds. After this first preference is taken what graz
ing lands remain shall be leased to stock-growers
who w,ere in actual use and occupancy of them dur
ing the year ending January i, 1901. This last pro
vision is for the purpose of preventing the formation
of syndicates to take such lands and crowd off the
Western herdsmen. The rental is uniform at 2. cents
per acre per year. As there are 400,000,000 acres of
grazing lands, they wculd produce $8,000,000 a year,
and the two bills together would provide a fund of
about $11,000,000 annually for irrigation, which
would immediately produce results and facilitate the
rapid settlement of the West. To this end the
Bowersock bill requires that all of the leased domain
shall be cpen to homestead and mineral entry, and
when so entered- shall be canceled out of the lease.
All shades of opinion are represented in this com
mittee of seventeen. A strong party in the West lias
for years favored and striven for the cession of the
public domain to the States, with a view to using it
in some way for the production of income for irriga
tion.- Against this has been opposed another party,
which sought to secure irrigation by large appropria
tions in the river and harbor bill. These have
threshed out their differences in the committee of
seventeen, and have compromised upon a proposition
that the arid region shall be considered as a unit,
that irrigation shall be applied, wherever practicable,
by the Federal Government, and that the public do
main shall be used to produce the funds for its own
improvement, thus relieving the . already burdened
river and harbor bill of a new object of attention and
expenditure. This plan is immediately popular with
the Eastern members, who will support. any measures
to effectuate it upon which the West agrees. There
are two such measures now before Congress, which
may be merged in one bill. One is introduced by
Senator Hansbrough of. North Dakota. It proposes
that the proceeds of the s,ales of public lands shall go
into the treasury as an irrigation fund. The other
is introduced by Mr. Bowersock of Kansas in the
House, and provides that the grazing lands on the
public domain shall be leased to the stock-growers
who now use them in common without paying for
such use. . .
This volunteer committee has undertaken to con
struct an irrigation measure which will be a compo
site of the bills now offered. When constructed it
will go to Congress through the regular committees.
THE subject of irrigation has gained greatly in
interest and influence in Congress. Each House
. has now a standing committee on Arid Lands
and Irrigation, and an enlightening discussion of the
subject has informed the East upon its importance
and its relation to national interests. Tfyere is a vol
untary committee on* irrigation, consisting. of seven
teen members of the House and Senate, from. States
west of the Missouri River. | ' ,
Another improvement the association has tinder-':
taken to bring about is one that should have' been;
accomplished long agoâ that of -putting Third street [
into a condition worthy of its importance among the V
thoroughfares, of the city. It is along that street pas-j
sengers arriving at the Third-street depot make their';
way to the city/and from it they derive their first im-;
pressions of San Francisco. It should be a stately,'
well-kept avenue of trade and traffic. At present it'
is something like a disgrace. When the street im-*
provement begins there -should be a further' effort';
made to get the railway company : to build a decent!
depot. Since the coast line'has been opened to LoV
Angeles a very large proportion of the tourist.travel
reaches San Francisco at that depot, and it 'ought to'
be made equal to the commodious depot buildings to
which people are accustomed in the East.

Jockey Flynn Held to Answer.
John J. Flynn, a jockey for Dennison &
Schwartz, was held to answer before the
Superior Court by Judge Conlan yester
day on the charge of an attempt to com
mit arson. On Christmas nieht he was
drunk and ugly and attempted to cut
Luther Taylor and Steve James, two
hostlers. They locked him up in a stable
at the Ingleside track and he set fire to
It. They had to break in the door and
put out the flames. '
Many clubs are after him, but the red
headed boxer waves them aside. He Is
waiting for the highest offer. Jack Glea
son, one of the managers of the ilate
Twentieth Century Club, is in; the field
and is making every effort to secure the
match. He has telegraphed and written
Jeffries and Fltzsimmons offering Â¦ them
70 per cent of the gross receipts if
they will box twenty rounds before
his club. As this is 8 per cent
higher than any offer made the men
they may consider it. Gleason has the
backing of wealthy men. He has had a
great deal of experience in bringing off
ring contests and has the confidence of
the local ring-goers. Although associated
with Kennedy last year, Gleason has
broken away from that manager and is
now in the field for, himself. ,

The Yosemite Athletic Club is in a
quandary. The directors of the new box

a twenty-round contest between Terry
McGovern and Dave Sullivan in this city
next month, but as the contestants were
desirous of fighting on the first of next
month the match was declared off so far
as this city is concerned. The Tosemlte
Club is therefore looking for material just
as good or even better for its initial show.
Jim Kennedy, the matchmaker of the
defunct Twentieth Century Club, is using
his endeavors to bring Fitzslmmons and
Jeffries together. He is working under
many disadvantages. The Yosemite Club
declares- that Kennedy has no connection
with their club and the sporting writers
throughout the West are saying mean
things about that gentleman. It is said
that he is the only man who can get Fitz
sfmrnons in the ring, but many people be
lieve that the blacksmith can only be
made to fight by promising him quantities
of yellow gold.

Alec Greggalns, manager of the San
Francisco Athletic Club, stated yesterday
that George Gardner and Jack Root
would battle, for the middle-weight
championship of the world in Mechanics 1
Pavilion on Friday evening, January 3L
The men will meet at catch weights.
Greggalns will send tickets to Root to
day and the Chicago boxer will be here
Within two weeks. Either Phil Wand or
Jim McDonald will referee the fight.
Gardner wllll go Into training next Alon
day. He will very probably condition
himself at Millett's, near Baden.
As Gardner is looked upon as the cham
pion, the coming battle ought to draw a
large crowd. - Gardner has defeated the
cleverest men at his weight, and the
only man fitted to give him battle is
Jack Root. Root is a clean-cut boxer anÂ«i
hard hitter. His last fight in this city was
with "Kid" Carter. He outpointed the
"Kid" for the first five rounds, but Car
ter came back hard and might have won
if he had not fouled Root.

Root and Gardner "Will Battle.
Such a bout would be of deep interest
to local sporting-, men! { Corbett proved in
a measure that he was not a hasbeen by
making the present champion look like a
veritable novice for twenty-three rounds.
Had Jim possessed the strength there i3
no doubt in- the. mind of many that he
would have beaten Jeff at their last meet
ing. If a match Is made Corbett will come
to this city two months before the night
of the contest and go into the country and
condition himself. Harry Corbett says
Jim is taking the best of care of himself.
Local ring-g-oers ma yet have another
chance of seeing Jim Corbett in the ring.
The eX'Champion is willing to try to re
gain the championship, and If arrange
ments can be made he and Jeffries may
box in September, next.
~ Harry dbrbett, the well-known sporting
man, received a ; letter from | his brother
yesterday, in which the latter asked him
to secure a match for him with the husky
boilermaker. Corbett. has always had an
Idea that he could | take Jeffries' . measure
and believes that he can outpoint Jeffries
In a twenty-round bout.
That the project is extravagant In cost and
unnecessarily difficult In construction and
maintenance. The system Is one of high pres
sure and therefore of greater risk in the" mat
ter of pipe breakage.. The city of Oakland and
the population north which, would buy water
from San Francisco and lessen the financial
burden are avoided by Grunsky In his plans.
Grunsky also permanently seta aside about 5000
horsepower of electricity to pump water over
"The Pass" and plans his system without re
gard to the development of the city. â¢
The American River as a source of \ supply
has been commended by Colonel A. W, von
Schmidt and by Colonel Jlendell, as well as
numerous other engineers. Evidence received
from many independent -sources seems to prove
that the North Fork of the American Rive/ 1 , at
high altitude, has perlect water, splendid res
ervoirs and excellent facilities for the develop
ment of electrical power. At the same time It
has the shortest pipe line to San Francisco on
the route proposed by Messrs. Dunn and Alber
ger. They have filed with the. board plans and
estimates suggesting the- manner and route
of conveying water to San Francisco, and claim
to have perfect rights to reservoirs and water
sheds sufficient to supply the needs of this
municipality for all time to come... Taken in
conjunction with the Rubicon River," a branch
of the American, there can be no question of
the supply.
Reed then produces figures to show that
the saving effected by the American River
supply compared with the Tuolumne sup
ply would be $9,126,608. He favors an aux
iliary supply now. owned by. the Dumbar
ton Land Company in Alameda, which
would cost $1,663,000. In the third chapter
Reed states his objections to the Tuol
umne supply. Summed up, the objections
are aa follows: - .
Favors American River.
There Is the further danger that the short
age of rain which prevents catchment will also
shorten the Merced and Alameda Creek sup
plies and thereby force a greater draft than
10,550,000 Kalians dally on the reservoirs and
thus exhaust them sooner. Frohj which it ap
pears that the city, in the matter of water sup
ply, is in the most dangerous condition it has
ever yet known, and must Immediately secure
some ampler supply for its future needs.
The Spring Valley Water Works Is built on
a wrong principle. Its main dependence la Its
peninsula reservoirs. These have an exceed
ingly large water surface, and an exceedingly
small drainage area. It is a system for catch-
Ing rain water, Just as rain Is caught from the
roof of a house, and collected in a cistern.
These reservoirs were thought to be safe, be
cause It was estimated that there never would
be more than three dry years In succession. The
projectors of the Spring Valley Water Works
took a gambler's chance of having an exceed
ingly wet year at least once in four, but they
have lost at the game, for we are now on the
fifth successive .dry year. Less than a year's
supply Is on hand in these reservoirs, while the
evaporation, and the water rights of San Mateo
residents take. up almost the total useful run
off of their drainage areas.
Inefficiency of Spring Valley.
Cost is not to be avoided if It results in a"
better system, but cost which results in no
good cannot be defended, nor can a system be
defended' whose operating expenses represents
an - unnecessary expenditure â¢ of $150,000 an
nually.
I have never had reason to question the good
faith of the City Engineer, but his course of
conduct for the past- two years Indicates such
a degree of Jealousy of fellow engineers, such
a determination to- avoid making use of the
experience and knowledge of men of his pro
fession, and such a reckless determination to
pile up the cost of the city water works be
yond all reason, that I have felt Justified in
criticizing his work as an engineer, and the
advisability of adopting it for the city.
In his report Reed states that he dis
agrees with the water works system from
the Toulumne River proposed by the City
Engineer, as it is, the most costly of any
prepared by a great many engineers. The
pamphlet is: In three chapters, the first of
which is devoted to the "inefficiency of
the Spring Valley system," the second to
theVater system from the American Riv
er, which is urged as the best for the
city, and the third to objections to the
Toulumne River system proposed by the
City Bngineer. In the report he says in
part: . . . .
Â¦ Supervisor Reed submitted a report yes
terday to the Board of Supervisors rec
ommending what he considers as. the besJt
water system ;for this city. , In addition
he indulged in , some caustic criticisms
on the system proposed by City Engineer
Grunsky. Reed submitted his report m
pamphlet form, it being in the nature of.
aiminorlty report from the Committee on

chairman during, his entire term of office.

cipally bellicose attitude of Argentina and the
flatness of copper, which fell 1^ to Â£47 per

Government Money Here.
was the declaration of a dividend of 2 per cent
on New Jersey Central- stock. The declaration
is timed at the usual period for the quarterly
dividend, which had been running at the rate
of 1*4 per cent, but the president of the Read-
Ing Company, which corporation now controls
the New Jersey Central; deprecated a designa
tion.of this as a quarterly dividend. Neverthe
less, the street was inclined to. the conviction
that the stock was to be considered on an S
per cent basis. Reading was stimulated into
great activity and rallied from an early decline
of over a point to 1)4 over . Saturday's level.
Delaware & Hudson became qulte.buoyant. ris
ing 6Â»4 points over Saturday on confident hopes
that it also was booked for an early Increase
in dividend. There was a sudden spurt of 3%
points In Minneapolis, St Paul & Sault Ste.
Marie and of 414 In Minneapolis & St. Louis.
The market generally recovered smartly from
its early depression, but very few stocks showed
any material gains over Saturday. Amalga
mated Copper. was an exception and after an
early weakness on the further decline in the
price of raw copper in London, roee 1% over
Saturday. The United States Steel stocks were
again dealt in on an enormous 'scale, the pre
ferred leading both In point of activity and
strength. Rumors were rife of the very favor
able showing to be made by the quarterly
statement of net earnings which is expected to
be presented at to-mcrrow's dividend meeting.
â¢There was no suggestion of the probability, of
any increase in the dividend rate. There were
incipient upward movements in a few other in
dustrials, while the railroad Hot tended lower
from the opening. The general list was sin
gularly unresponsive to the demonstration In
United States Steel. The immediate cause, of
Us sluggishness and heaviness was the Incep
tion of gold exports, it being reported during
the day that $600,000 had been sent out on Sat
urday's steamer by the institution which also
withdrew $500,000 from the Sub-Treasury to
day. It is now accepted that if more gold does
not go out this week It will be because there
happens to be no swift steamer sailing, af
fording a saving of interest . on the gold In
transit, but that a considerable sum of gold
will go out in the immediate future is consid
ered certain. The financial trouble in the rub
ber trade, .following upon the developments
concerning the trolley promoting syndicate,
caused -some reserve In speculation. " The rise'
in United States Steel extended to T s and In the
preferred to 1%. There was quite an active de
mand for the locomotive stocks, the gsln Jn the
preferred reaching :{%. The market closed firm
and active.
The bond market yielded In the morning, but
responded partly to thr recovery in stocks and
closed irregular. Total sales, par value, $3,780,-
The United States coupon 5s advanced li per
cent on the last call.

â¢ Minnie Seligman scored another trtumph
last evening In the double billâ Gilbert's
"Comedy and Tragedy" and "Cavalleria
Rustic-ana," both of which productions
afford ample opportunity for the display
of her powers in the emotional. In the
Sicilian tragedy she was at her best, and
as the betrayed and abandoned Santuzza
unlisted thÂ«? sympathies of the audience.
She is thoroughly in earnest in all that
che does, and the only spot that may mar
her performance in the eyes of the very
critical is a tendency to overdo. But that
1b not aÂ» bad a fault as the opposite, and
in the face of so much excellence it would
be hypercritical to dwell upon what at
the mott is only a minor consideration.

Three babies are making a tremendous
hit at the California this week In "Whose
Baby Are You?" The little tots appear in
the second act and exemplify the truth
of the old adage, "One touch of nature
makes the whole world kin." One lies
on Its back and yells, another crawls on
Its diminutive stomach, while the third
toddles around until it falls. The audi
ence cheers wildly and the curtain is
raised five times. The play hasn't much
plot, but the funny situations are numer
ous and cause shrieks of laughter. Miss

Michael Murphy on a sergeant's pension:
Officer Murphy was at one tirruÂ»-a ser

tired with an officer's pension. The action
of the Pension Board is due to the recent
decision which was rendered by the Su

Henry Hart, one of the best known
bookmakers In the country, committed
suicide some time yesterday in his room
at "47 Post street by inhaling illuminating
gas. Shortly after 5 o'clock last evening
W.-S. Smith, the landlord of the house
in which Hart lived, detected the smell
of escaping gas and he started to make
an investigation. Going to the bookma
ker's room he found the place filled with
gas and Hart lying dead on the floor.
Before retiring HarV had turned on the
three gas jets in the room, determined
that his attempt at suicide would not be
a failure. Hart was suffering from an
incurable disease, and becoming despond
ent over his condition he resolved to end
his life. Up to the time of his death he
was employed by Joe Harvey in making a
book at Sausalito.
BOOKMAKER HENRY HART
ENDS HIS 0"WH EXISTE
- The thermometer had previously regis
tered 42 degrees below zero and the near
est place, a roadhouse kept by John Wag
oner, was eight miles away. Night had
fallen before the eight miles- . were cov
ered. Approaching the cabin, the suffer
ing man -could see no smoke from the
chimney and when he burst In the door
he found the interior cold and cheerless.
His coat was frozen so solidly to his body
that it was Impossible to bend or re
move it.
When Wagoner finally returned to his
cabin it was to find Downing with his
face, hands and feet frozen. Coal oil, the
only remedy at hand, was employed in
removing the frost, and when this was
accomplished the unfortunate carrier was
in awful agony.
On the next day Downing started for.
Dawson with his mail, entreaties and ex
postulations from Wagoner having no ef
fect.'. He was determined to -finish his
journey and set out, alternately hobbling
and riding, when the condition of the road
would permit.* Before star, the next sta
tion, was reached blisters as large as a
hand had formed on the frozen feet and
the lonely man made a camp on the snow
for himself and dogs. Open water again
interposed between the traveler and his
haven of safety, and the arrival of an
other traveler, Dow by name, was provi
dential. The blisters were opened and the
feet bandaged and the rest of the jour
ney marked another agonizing struggle.
When Dawson was finally reached the
man's feet were in a bad condition and
he was instantly taken to a hospital for
treatment. Amputation of the extremi
ties may save his life.
The story of' how Downing went through
the ice on the Yukon, his subsequent mi
raculous escape and his struggles for life
after getting out gives outsiders a faint
idea, of what the pioneers of the Yukon
country have to contend with. The spot
where Downing went through the ice ia
150 miles from Dawson. His struggles re
sulted in further breaking of the Ice. and
the freezing man repeatedly fell back into
the water. By a desperate endeavor he
finally managed to climb out and hastily
made such additions to his dress as was
possible.
' SEATTLE, Jan. 6. â Late Dawson ad
vices tell of the narrow escape from
death by freezing of Benjamin Downing,
a down-river mail contractor and carrier,
who at last reports was in a Dawson
hospital, suffering greatly from Injuries
he had received. It was believed that
amputation of his feet would be neces
sary. He was brozen from his knees to
the tips of his toes while making a re
markable trip from Eagle to Dawson.
Miss Aphie James was effective and
graceful as Anne Bullen, and the rest of
the cast was acceptably filled.
GUISARD.
Not in the two hours pleasantly prophe
sied in "King Henry VIII's" prologue,
but in a creditable three, the eleven
scenes of "he play are staged and acte<i
by the Modjeska and James company at
the Columbia this week. The scenery is
strikingly handsome and proper to < tha
play throughout, particularly Wolsey's
Palace and a hall In Blackfriars, where
the pcenlc illusion, is of the highest order.
The costuriing, too â while one is about
the trimmings of the play â is rich 'and
eplendia. and costumes, scenery and ac
cessories have been carried out with ad
mirable historical correctness. It is quite
the kind of thing to take the young per
son to who has a grudge against history,
and Indeed the best way to take ycur
history If you can so get it;
Modjeska still has power to charm, and
as Queen Katharine looks amazingly
young and handsome. She is still gracioas
and graceful, fine and finished, of a noo.e
bearing and accent, and sweet dignity.
But there is a little fire, a little fiber, gone
out other work, something of the clear
ness and roundness of the voice, a hint
of youth vanished and age creeping on.
though Modjeska will always be worth
seeing. '
In the trial scene, where, badgered by
the two ecclesiastics beyond bearing, she
at last leaves the court lest in her anger
the say what would do her cause
much ill. her part was carried off in a
queenly and spirited lashion, that roused
the audience to hearty plaudits. Not less
stately and sincere, and womanly as well,
was her scene with the red-garbed Car
dinals in her own apartments after her
abandonment, and a shower of flowers
from her many admirers made a pretty '
ending to the act.
Louie James, of course, acts what no
body would think of calling anything else
than the "wily Cardinal." I have seen no
other actor than Mr. James in the part,
but should like to. I should like, for in
stance, to see the young man who calls
himself Jerome Harrington and who plays
Cardinal Campeius take a whackâ your
pardonâ at the part. Mr. Harrington has
one of the prettiest ecclesiastical accents
that I have heard this many a dayâ a
very Cardinal, in faith. When the two
Cardinals occupy the stage at one time
there is a suggestion of insincerity in the
Wolsey that does not belong wholly to the
character. Still. Mr. James is a dignified
and manly Wolsey, and occasionally, if
not always, convincing. He is much more
plausible in' his misfortune- than in his
glory, and Is seen at his best with the
malingering lords baiting him after his
fall. 'Â¦: -
Those sa::ne lords, as Doolan would say.
are wonders. 1- find in private life they
are dubbed Wadsworth Harris. John
Hons ami Anthony Andre, and the first
two are asi noble barnstormers as evei
ranted "Hamlet" under canvas. The
Duke of Buckingham is acted in a neat
and cJeverish fashion by Thomas Coffin
Cooke. who spoke his lines in a more
than commonly intelligent way.
Henry, though discourteously last, by
no means comes least in order of merit
as Mr. Haekett plays him. One might
disagree with the Haekett conception in
parts, but one had to respect it. It was
a. strong, virile and original reading,
though crude and uneven. Correct in out
line it lacks somewhat in the detail that
should pull it together, but it is promis
ing- and interesting work. Mr. Haekett
looks the part, though handsomer than
bluff King Hal Is usually painted by more
truthful historians than Shakespeare,
w*o -^eteely -crooked the pregnant knee in
drawing this picture of Elizabeth's saint
ed papa. Mr. Hackett's costumes should
not go without mention, being splendid
and artistic in the extreme.
Mrs. Cannican is being held at the
County Jail under . charges, "but the au
thorities will examine her to determine
her mental condition. . Â¦ Â¦Â¦;-?Â¦?.

net want her to get into the room where "my
little child was.
"Oh, just because she talked about me."
Mrs. Gutte is the wife of Henry W.
Gutte. a well known insurance man of
San Francisco. Speakinpr of the struggle
with the maniac, she said: '
Before she could crowd her ferocious 1
assailant off the porch Mrs. Gutte re-'|
ceived gashes in her right arm and other
slashes in her hands.'-
After being driven oft the maniac de- ,
parted and Mrs. Gutte telephoned to the
police station. Sergeant Albert Kamp re
sponded and traced Mrs. Cannican to a
house in the rear of the residence at 20j3 !
San Jose avenue, where she has lived for
eight years. She was arrested- and taken
to the City Prison, where Mrs. Gutte
swore to a complaint charging Mrs. Can
nican with an assault with a deadly
weapon. This afternoon the knife-wlelder
was lodged in the County Jail.-.
She has been regarded for some time as
slightly demented, but heretofore has not
exhibited any murderous tendencies. '.Mrs.
.Cannican is about forty years of age and
.has -earned a living by doing washing and:
scrubbing. â¢ !
When asked why she attacked Mrs.
Gutte the prisoner answered:
"I want to show you something," said
the maniac, who is large and muscular.
Without hesitation Mrs. Gutte moved
without the door. Her strange caller in
stantly, whipped a big knife from beneath
a cape she wore and lunged viciously at
Mrs. Gutte s head. The blade, entangled
in the coils of hair upon the head of the
maniac's intended victim, its course was
stayed before it reached the scalp.' With
a second attempt the assailant tried to
cut Mrs. Gutte's throat, but swung short.
Mrs. Cannican again wielded the knife
and Mrs. Gutte put up her right hand to.
ward off the blow. The weapon struck
the index and second finger of Mrs.
Gutte's hand, almost severing them at the
joints. ..... .... Â¦ .
ALAMEDA, Jan. 6.â Cut in numerous
places and 6m$ared with blood,' Mrs.
Henry W. Gutte fought a desperate bat
tle on the front porch of her residence,
1S35 San Jose avenue, shortly before noon
to-day with a maniac, Mrs. Annie Canni-"
can. Mrs. Gutte's assailant used a
butcher-knife and slashed her in various
places with the weapon.'
Just before .the desperate. encounter be
tween the women Mrs. Gutte was called
to the front door of her home by, the
ringing of the bell. _ As she^opened the
door she was confronted by the Cannican
woman, who asked her to step out. upon
the porch. â¢ .-'Â¦ Â¦.>â¢_.Â¦' . . â¢-.-. . -
After some wrangling on both sides and
an hour's lecture from the court' on the
disgraceful conduct of counsel â¢ and the
ignominy they were bringing upon the
proceedings in this trial, Judge Harring
ton remitted both fines. During the re
mainder of the afternoon things went
along smoothly. -
An argument arose between Post and
Spencer." Spencer- told -Post- that he had
forgotten' more' law than Post ever knew.
The court directed the clerk to fine Spen
cer $10, with .the alternative of one day in
Jail. Spencer exclaimed that he would
not sit down. or shut up! "if hell dropped
the next minute." He was. fined $10 more.
Spencer .said he thought it enough- that
the court should always rule against him,
and said the court had no right to make
it Worse by - calling him Â¦ a ! fool. He Â¦ said
that he would go to Jail, as. he. would
never pay â¢ another dollar to .'the Modoc
County Treasurer; he did not propose to
be bankrupted by paying fines.

In . answer to a remark from â¢ the court
Judge E. V. Spencer of the defense:ex
claimed'that he had practiced law for
more than forty years .and, believed that
he knew something about it.' and he would
have just as good an opinion of himself
after, this case was concluded, provided
he was allowed to live through it, as he
had before- it commenced.' ' â¢â¢-â¢ â¢.

change of compliments between the court

tion has begun to term it, went before the
Jury. Â¦ - - ' Â¦Â¦ 'Â¦ Â¦Â¦;â¢-'â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦--Â¦-
After the disposal, of the writ the trial
of Brown was called. The first witness
examined was Robert Gibson, a sawmill
hand, residing near Lookout. He said that
he was in Lookout on the day of the in
quest over the bodies of the mob's .vic
tims, and in company with four/ others
heard Defendant Brown say that It had
been public talk in Lookout for some time
that Hall "and the others would be
lynched. Abe "Rowley, one of the crowd,,
asked -Brown, why, if -that, were so, he!
had not. made some preparations so that
the prisoners could defend themselves in
case of an emergency. Brown replied that
he believed it was against the law to pro
vide weapons with .which prisoners could
protect themselves. .
. In the ' cross-examination Attorney
Raker, asked Gibson if he had not been a
witness in a case in Lassen County, and
if it were not a fact that, he- was im
peached in that. case. Gibson was not al
lowed to answer, and Raker, applied for a
subpoena for, the men who were Jurors in
that Â»case. ; The application was denied.
Raker then said that he could prove that
the witness "was impeached, and .was told
by Â» the court that if he repeated that
statement he would be imprisoned. â¢

' ALTURAS, Jan. 6.â The arrest of fifteen
men and other sensational developments
of the last two days do not seem, to hav*
had a tendency to improve the tempers
of court' and counsel in the case of the
people, vs. James W. Brown, the alleged
Lookout lyncher. This afternoon's session
of the court was stormy. Habeas corpus
proceedings on behalf of the supposed
lynchers arrested | in the past three days
were heard, and after a prolonged engage
ment - between . the lawyers were dis
missed. Judge Harrington in dismissing
the writ did not give a decision as to the
right of Judge E. M; Cherry as a"commit
ting magistrate, simply ordering that, a
commitment be drawn and the prisoners
remanded on the order of the court. He'
held that the warrants under which these,
men were arrested were valid, but that it
was possible that Cherry did not have ju-.
rlsdlction In the case of a crime commit
ted outside the corporate limits of Altu
ras,' as Cherry is Recorder of the town un

men were to have been arraigned before
Judge Cherry this afternoon.

The skin is the seat of an almost end-
less variety of diseases. They are known
by various names, but are all due to the
same cause, acid and other - poisons in
the blood that irritate and interfere with
the proper action of the skin."
To have a smooth, soft skin, free from
all eruptions, the blood must be kept pure
and healthy. The many preparations of
arsenic and potash and the large number
of face powders and lotions generally
used in this class of diseases cover up
for a short .time, but cannot remove per-
manently the ugly blotches and the red;
disfiguring pimples.
Eternal vigilance is the price
of a boautiful complexion
when such remedies are relied on.

sational deposition to-day Un his suit
against Clarence M. Brune, a theatrical
manager, who last season starred his
wife, Minnie "Tittell Brune, and Mac-
Dowell In Sardou's play "Theodora.".
MacDowell in his deposition swears that
in New . York, while intoxicated, he was
induced to sign bills of sale conveying the
rights to the Sardou plays to Brune for
$500. He asserts that fraud was used in
bringing about the transaction and asks
that it be set aside. The suit was .filed in
Ramsay County, Minnesota, and seeks to
recover damages and to restrain Bruno
from producing any of the Sardou plays.
Other sensational statements are made by
MacDowell in his deposition, one being to
the effect that he was drugged in New

first to Boston and then to Newport
News, and" that at Â¦ Baltimore later and
while, still' under the influence of the drug
he was married. ' â" -

can't protect themselves, makes them peevish and afraid of the dose.

which he subsquently; made to this

: Judge Gilbert says: ' ' ' V,
â¢ '.The whole : of Â¦',. the evidence'' concerninic the

providing that the: net annual receipts as
adjusted by the Board of Supervisors shall
not be less than 6 nor more than 18' per

- them a number of concessions.
They first demand that all fines that
"1 t:ave been charged up against them be
. triped off the book, and, â¢ secondly, that
the present rate of penalties be cut ' in
half. When a boy does 'not show up for
work on a week day he is at present
fined $1, and J2 on Sunday. The boys
Â¦ think tills fine should be cut In half.
Should the Lo>s oversleep themselves they
are charged 30 cents per hour every hour
they are late. They think that 15 cents
. would be a much more appropriate flg
i ure. "Kid" Lewis says that he will sub-
I tail to these figures if "de gang", vrill
I came back, but he hands them a solar

<'ie fines, he says, the boys .must" in the
