Special v Dlspatch to The Call.
BATH. Me.. Jan. 20.-Word has been re
ceived here of the eventful voyage of the
ship James Drummond, from Puget
Sound to Fremantle, Australia, during
which the captain was forced to kill his
mate to save his own life and prevent a
mutiny on the craft. The Drummond was
built here and sold to San Francisco men,
and has since been in service on the Pa
cific Coast. Her captain is H. J. Nason.
who had charge of the vessel during her
trips along the Atlantic coast. The
Drummond left for Fremantle with a
cargo of lumber. Captain Nason shipped
as mate Thomas Burns, who had sailed In
that capacity on a number of American
vessels. . - â¢; .
The Drummond left Puget Sound late In
April, and almost as soon as the voyage
began the new mate commenced to make
trouble. He began by ill-treating the Chi
nese cabin boy and was rebuked by the
captain. This embittered the mate, and
be annoyed' the skipper by taking duties
into his own hands usually attended to by
the captain. The captain objected to this
practice, and wanted to fight immediately.
From that time on Burns came on 'deck
every day armed with a revolver, and

Sceclal Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
"W., WASHINGTON, Jan. 20.â Congress
received from President Roosevelt to-day
the supplemental report of the Isthmian
Canal Commission, in which its recom
mendation as to the route for the inter
oceanic canal is changed from Nicaragua
to Panama.
All of the members of the commission
signed the report, which was referred to
the Senate committee on interoceanic ca
nals. It will cause a bitter fight between
the friends of the two routes in the com
mittee, as in the Senate. The chances
are that the report will have no weight
with the majority of the committee, and
that there will be a majority report In
favor of Panama. -
Then there will be a contest at intervals
which is likely to extend through the en
tire session of Congress, and may ter
minate without any action being taken.
This is the popular feeling entertained.
There is, however, such strong sentiment
In favor of the authorization of the canal
that the administration may be able to
force a compromise. It Is too early to
say whether the House, which has al
ready passed a Nicaragua canal bill,
would accept a ' Senate amendment pro
viding for the Panama route.
House May Accept.
Sj There fcÂ» a. feeling, however, that if the
Senate passes a bill leaving the final de
cision of Â¦ a Â¦ route to the President the
House will accept it. To Senators who
are in favor of deferring action Is fur
nished an argument in the report, which
shows that before the United States can
begin the construction of the canal long
and . tedious negotiations must be under
taken for clearing title and for obtaining
concessions from. Colombia. It is the
policy of .the administration to remove
all cause for delay, and for this purpose
negotiations are already under way be
tween Minister Silva and Secretary Her
ran of the Colombian Legation and Rear
Admiral Walker of the Isthmian Canal
Commission for a protocol prescribing
the terms of American construction of
the canal at Panama.
In these negotiations the Colombian
Government has already shown a dispo
sition to require the United States to pay
an annual rental of $1,500,000 from the
time the concession begins, and this may
have an unfavorable effect upon the Pan
ama side of the argument when the ques
tion comes up in Congress. One of the
majn points against adopting the Nicar
agua route is that its cost of mafntnn
nnce Is $3,390,000 a year against $2,000,000
for Panama, but this rental would more
than wipe out the difference and make It
Â£200,000 in favor of Nicaragua.
What Colombia Wants.
Rear Adnjjral Walker 13 acting for the
State Department In conducting negotia
tions with the diplomatic representatives
Â¦of Colombia for the new canal conces
sion. 'Colombia is willing to grant to the
United States the lease of a strip of ter
ritory ten miles wide, practically In per.
petuity, and to give the United States po
lice and judicial jurisdiction. Colombia
desires from. the United States a guaran
tee of her sovereignty over the territory
of the Department of Panama, with the
exception of the leased strip, and the an
nual payment by the United States of not
less than $1,500,000. Colombia Is entitled
under the contract with the canal com
pany to a share in the gross income of the
canal from all Â¦ sources on an Increasing
scale from S per cent at first to 3 per cent
from V the seventy-sixth year after lta
opening to the termination of the privi
lege. In addition, Colombia holds bond*
of the company valued at $1,000,000.
Figures in the Report.
The report submitted to-day gives In
full the correspondence which has passed
between the commission and the Panama
Canal Company at Paris, which Includes
a, cablegram from the president of ths
board dated January 9, as follows:
"The new Panama Canal Company de
clares that It is ready to accept for thÂ«
totality, without exception, of its prop
erty and rights on the Isthmus tha
amount of $40,000,000. the above offer to
remain in force up to March 4, 1903."
The â¢ report states that, the "totality"
mentioned In its message includes fifty*
six parcels of land amounting to 30.004
acres, which coyer nearly all cf th<j
ground required for the actual construe- Â¦
tlon". pf the canal. It also includes 2431
buildings used for offices, quarters, hos
pitals, storehouses, etc.; also an Immense
amount of machinery, consisting of float

In an encounter with three highwaymen
who were endeavoring to rob a citizen in
front of the bicycle and hardware
store of W. J. Kenney. 531 Valencia
street at 1:15 o'clock this morning. Po
lice Officer E. C. Robinson was shot thr*;e
times in the abdomen and probably fa
tally wounded. Officer Taylor, who we t
to his assistance, succeeded in wounding
one of the trio.
About a dozen shots were exchanged.
As eoon as the officers in the vicinltv
heard the shooting they rushed to the
scene. Officer Tim Connell went to the
wounded officer's assistance, and when
the ambulance arrived he ordered that
Robinson should be sent to the Railroad
Hospital at Fourtenth and Mission
streets.
It is said by some who were in the vi
cinity that when the robbers were dis
covered committing their crime by
Officer Robinson, one of them fired a
shot at him and the officer returned thÂ»
fire. Officer Taylor came up on the run
and intercepted one of the men as he was
turning the corner of Valencia and Six
teenth streets. Taylor shot him through
the neck.
The thief fell and was ironed and sent
in &n ambulance to the City anÂ£ County
Hospital, where he gave the name pf
S. Bayly. When searched a stick of dy
namite was found in his pocket. He re
fused to disclose the identity of his as
sociates. His wound is not considered
fatal..
August Mebels, who was standing in
front of Harry Bentham's saloon, about
half a block east of the scene of the
shooting, says he first heard one shot,
followed at a short interval by three In
quick succession, and then half a dozen
more. Three men came running down
Valencia street in the direction of Six
teenth and turned the corner.
"I ran over toward them, when one of
them said, 'Do you want some of this?'
pointing a pistol at me. I ran back. One'
of the men was clean shaven, the other
two had mustaches; two had on long
overcoats, and the third man had light
pants. As they were running Officer Tay
lor came up and fired at the crowd, one
of the men falling. The other two turned
into Julian avenue and got away."
Vvnen Robinson fell he was taken to
Eastman's plumbing shop, at 517 Valencia
street, and was attended by Drs. Sullivan
an<5 J. J. Crowley, who urged his immedi
ate removal to a hospital. Robinson was
very low at the time and was bleeding
freely. He was unable to give an account
of the affray.
As soon as the news reached police
headquarters Detectives J. Dlnan and
Bell, accompanied by Assistant District
Attorney -Greany, went to the Railroad
Hospital to take Robinson's dying state
ment. Owing to his very weak condition
It wsls a very slow task.
A further search of the clothing- of the
robber who was shot disclosed an un
malled letter ready for registering ad
dressed to F. Daly. Stockton. It was as
certained later that the right name of the
wounded man" Is William H. Henderson.
He had a brace and bit concealed on him
in addition to the dynamite.
Some ten years ago a man of the same
name wm sentenced to San Quentin for
ten years for a burglary committed at
the corner of Powell and Geary streets.
The police believe he Is the same man.
Police OfScer E. C Robinson was ap
pointed to the police force on December
2. 1895, and was assigned to the Mission
district. He was formerly a clerk. He is
a native of this State, and was born . !n
1865. ' He wu unmarried. His " record has
been exceptionally good, and he was re
garded as an excellent officer by his supe
riors. -â¢' -'Â¦;
In his flying statement Robinson said
he encountered the three men at Eight
eenth and Valencia streets, where they
were trying to hold a man up. They
ran at the eight of the officer and a run
ning duel followed, ending by his being
wounded in front of Kenney's place. Rob
inson was very low when the statement
was taken and was bareiy able to answer
questions.

Eades and Robert' Leventon jointly came to
consult the District Attorney of Modoc County
In regard to prosecuting these parties arrested,
namely, the Halls, Tantis and Martin Wilson.
Eades asd Leventon found the District Attor
ney unable to bo to Lookout and prosecute
these cases and they secured from him the ap
pointment of Attorney C. C. Auble, who re
sides at Adln, In Modoc County, as Deputy
District Attorney to proceed with the prosecu
tion of the cases against the accused parties.
In consultation with the District Attorney in
reference to charges against the men who had
been arrested. Eades and Leventon were ad
vised by the District Attorney that If Hall re
fused to show the hide of a certain calf which
they alleged he had recently killed and of
which they had found the head and feet, and
some portions of the meat, he was guilty of an
offense and might be prosecuted.
As for Brown, Spencer claimed the abil
ity of the defense to prove that Brown
never participated in the hanging nor that
he participated directly or indirectly in
any conspiracy to lynch any one at any
time; that he never asked John Hutton
to join the mob; that he did not ask Hut
ton to be one of the rope-preparing party
and that Brown did not go from Myers*
Hotel to the schoolhouse, where the
lynching party had assembled, and never
agreed to signal for the lynching party
that "everything was ready" by the light
ing of a cigar on the porch of the hotel.
In fact. Spencer offered to prove that
Brown had not in any way exceeded his
authority sts an officer of the law; that
Brown and his guards were held up at
the point of guns in the hands of memÂ»
bers of the mob and that tho prisoners
were forcibly taken from the hotel and
lynched. - ,
But what Spencer claims for the de
fense is best told In that gentleman's own
words. His address to the Jury was in
part as follows:
By permission of the court, gentlemen of the
jury. I will undertake to make you a brief
statement- of the substance of the defense In
this action. I shall not undertake to go into
the detail of evidence, but will Btate to you the
substantial facts which we expect to establish.
There were certain arrests made on Saturday,
the 25th day of May, 1001. which were the be
ginning of proceedings which led to matters
which have been and -will be presented to you..
There were four persons arrested. These ar
rests were made in the absence of this defend
ant. He knew nothing of and had nothing
whatever to do with these arrests until Monday
morning. The cases were called up before the
magistrate and were continued at the request
of the defendant. Monday afternoon this de
fendant was appointed Deputy Constable by
Mr. Carpenter, who was constable of that
township, a position which Mr. Brown accept
ed reluctantly.
Brown CTot a Conspirator.
Judge E. V. Spencer made the opening
statement for the defense this afternoon.
The address was short. Spencer claimed
the defense could undermine the testimony
of all of the â¢witnesses for the prosecu
tion. His argument was an Impeachment
of every statement made by John Huttou
and Claude Morris, the "assumed con
fessors," as Spencer designated them, and
of the testimony of Robert Courtwright
of Lookout, one of the first witnesses
called by the prosecution. Courtwright
testified that he saw the ropes used by
the lynchers tested in the store of E. S.
Trowbridge in Lookout.
Spencer denied absolutely that. Hutton
Â¦waa present at the lynching, that he was
present at the rope-testing meeting held
In the shed back of Trowbridge's store,
or that he was "a member of the "town
party," and asserted the ability of the de
fense to show that Hutton had absolutely
no connection with the lynching. Prac
tically the same claims were made in re
gard to the testimony of Claude Morris,
but his testimony was not touched upon
so minutely as that of Hutton.
Spencer went so far In his claims of
what the defense could prove as to make
the emphatic assertion that none of the
persons named by Hutton and Morris in
their confessions Ind in their testimony
on the stand were members of the lynch
ing- party.
it Is evident that If counsel for the de
fense can prove one-tenth what they
claim they can they will make Hutton
and Morris appear as the greatest pair of
perjurers that ever prevaricated In a Cal
ifornia court, and will completely knock
the props from under the foundation laid
by Assistant Attorney General Post and
his colleagues, Bturtevant and Boyd, for
the conviction of "Jim" Brown, defendant
fn this now famous' case.
What Defense Hopes to Prove.
courtroom spectators and the attorneys
for the defense this morning by a^aounc
lng: that the people rested their case and
would not recall witness Claude Morris.
Spencer then asked- that Judge Harring
ton order all the testimony of Morris
stricken out. on the ground, that it was
Incompetent, that It was in the nature of
a confession and not given voluntarily,
that his testimony placed him in the po
sition of accomplice and that the defense
had not had sufficient opportunity to
cross-examine the witness. The court
ruled that the testimony of Morris was
distinctly competent and denied the mo
tion in every particular.
Spencer then askea that the court ' ad
vise the jurv to find a verdict of not
guilty," as the prosecution had not pre
sented sufficient evidence to prove the de
fendant guilty of the offense chafed.
Judge Harrington responded: -
"1 respectfully deny tne motion. Mr.
Spencer." \
On the request of the attorneys for the
defense Judge Harrington ordered a re
cess until 2 o'clock this afternoon.

Defense Calls First "Witness.
In conclusion, gentlemen of. the Jury, we ex
pect to satisfy you by evidence on the part of
the defense in , this case that* the defendant
haa been acting In everything he has done in
connection with this matter in good faith as
a peaceable and law-abiding citizen and striv
ing only for the enforcement of the laws.
Further, I expect to satisfy you by evidence
that all of the parties participating in making
the arrests of Mr. Hall. Frank Hall, Jim Hall,
Mr. Yantls and Martin Wilson were acting in
good faith. We expect to satisfy you that they
were acting solely with the desire to enforce
the law. , <
We will show you that this defendant did
not have a conversation about the hanging of
those men, as reported by young Harris; that
no conversation was had in the blacksmith shop
of Robert Leventon in regard to the hanging of
the prisoners, as alleged by young Harris; that
none of those conversations ever occurred, . and
nothing of that character ever occurred; that
.this defendant could not see Robert P. Court
right in Trowbridge's store on the day before
the lynching, as stated by Mr. Courtrlght; that
defendant did not see any one in the back of
the room, as stated by Mr.'Courtright, on that
occasion, fixing ropes. He did not see J J
Potter or J. R. Myers there, as stated by Mr
Robert P. Courtrlght. We will show you also
that they were not there, and no such pro
ceedings were had; also that the defendant did
not make the statement to Myron Ayers that
It was the common talk of Lookout that those
men ought to be hanged or sent to State's
prison, or that the mob came sooner than he
expected, or that he went out on the porch and
lit a cigar; that hone of these things occurred.
We will show you that he did not say In the
presence of Witness Gibson, or any one, that
"I did not know that the mob was coming so
eoon." That he did not' make use of such a
remark In the presence of Witness Lamburth
or anything to 'that effect.
Denies All Conversations.
We will show, to your entire satisfaction,
where Nichols was that night; we will show
where Leventon was that night and that he
was not one of the six men who are alleged by
Hutton and Morris to have gone across the
bridge. We will show you where J. J. Potter
was that night, and that he was not one of the
six* men. We will account for every one of
those men who are named by Hutton and Mor
ris as having participated in that mob.
We will show you in that connection also,
that Sam Parks, one of the men who is accused
of having participated in that lynching, and
who is said by these alleged confessors to have
gone over from the town to the school house
with what has been called the "town party."
was in that hotel, occupying a room upstairs,
directly over that barroom where the prisoners
were when the mob came; that he was awak
ened by the confusion and noise. caused by the
mob, dressed hurriedly,' came out of his room
and met persons in the hall, and that by the
light of the lamp which was in Myers' room,
the door of which was open, he could be plainly
seen.
Right in that connection we will show you
that J. R. Myers, proprietor of the hotel at
which the prisoners were kÂ»pt. came down
stairs to see what was going on and tried to
get Into the barroom to prevent the lynching,
and a gun was stuck in his face and he was
compelled to stand back; that he then went to
his room upstairs for the purpose of getting
a weapon when a few of his family.- or one
of tha members of his family, a grown young
woman, upon his entering the room, threw her
arms around his neck and held him to keei)
him from going back downstairs until the
mob went away.
Alibis for the Suspects.
In that connection we will show you that
on the night of the alleged hanging, a mob of
masked men came into the- barroom of the
hotel. Â¦ where Â¦ there prisoners were, and that
the defendant and his assistant guard were
compelled to hold. up their hands at the muz
zles of firearms and were held In that position
until the prisoners were taken away from
them forcibly and. taken from the hotel.
This defendant did not tell Hutton "the first
pretty night they would be gotten out of the
way." or that "they ought to be hung," or
"ought to be sent to State prison," or any
thing of that kind; also that this defendant
did not go over to the school house on Thurs
day night; that the defendant did not agree
to give a signal and that the defendant did not
give a signal by lichting- a ci^ar. or otherwise
to the alleged mob. Defendant wns In the
hotel with the prisoners from the time ho
went on guard that night until the prisoners
were taken away from him by the mob.
We will show you further in that connec
tion that the defendant did not put the rope"
Into a barley sack; that the defendant did
not carry the ropes to the blacksmih shop;
that the defendant did not put any ropes into
the coal house as described by Mr. Hutton, or
otherwise.
We -will show you that the persons named
and designated by Mr. Hutton as being present
at that morning's rope meeting in Trowbridge's
store were not there at all and knew noth
ing of the circumstances as related by s Mr.
Hutton. We will show you by satisfactory
evidence where they were and what they were
doing at the time of the alleged rope meeting
at Trowbrldgfc's store. We will show you that
while Mr. Triowbridge was at his store that
morning engaged in the usual transaction of
business he knew nothing of the alleged trans
action at that rope meeting described by Mr.
Hutton and that he was busy that morning
attending to the usual business of his estab
lishment, and that nothing of the kind de
scribed by Mr. Hutton occurred.
And right in this connection we expect to
ehow to your entire satisfaction that no cir
cumstances actually occurred to Justify the
Inference that he did engage in any conspiracy
or have anything whatever to do with any
conspiracy. We will show you that this de
fendant did not. make the alleged request of
John Hutton to Join the mob at any time
whatever; also that this defendant did not re
quest Claude Morris to Join at any time what
ever. We will show you further that this de
fendant did not request Hutton to go to Trow
bridge's store to help pick out the ropes "as
was stated by Mr. Hutton; that defendant
Brown was not there, and, as I have already
stated, that on that very morning- he was on
the road to the Hall ranch. We will show
you also that there was no talk, understanding
or agreement with Mr. Trowbridge. Fred Rob
erts. Eades or anybody else that Hutton
should be at the store to assist In picking out
the ropes. Â¦. â¢
Wo will show you further that the defend
ant did not participate in that hanging by the
mob. That, however, is apparent from the
evidence of the prosecution, and we will make
it plain from this evidence that he did not
participate, either directly or indirectly, one
way or the other. We will show you further
that this defendant never entered Into or en
gaged in any conspiracy to hang the men who
are alleged to have been hanged, or to hang
anybody.
Denies Everything 1 in Toto.
We expect to show that no such language
occurred; that no threats were used, no blows
were struck, and further, to show In that con
nection that Mr. Hall's conduct was such that
there was no occasion for any harsh treatment,
harsh words or force by anybody. It was ap
parently a willing and pleasant affair. Mr.
Hall did not walk behind the wagon, as stated
by Agnes Wilson, but got into the wagon before
it started, with the other gentlemen, rode to
Lookout cheerfully, chatting pleasantly all the
way, as if there was nothing wrong with the
proceedings.
. We will show you further, as occurring:
about that time, that this defendant did not
make an offensive search of Mary Hall â usual
ly spoken of as â¢'Old-Mary," or something llki
that; that this defendant did not make an of
fensive search of either her or the girl, 1 Agnes
Wilson.
prosecuted therefor. They were also assured
by Mr. Auble that from facts within his knowo
edge they had abundance of evidence to hold
these accused parties for trial. It was sup
posed by that they had evidence sufficient to
bind them over to appear before the Superior
Court for trial here in. Alturas on Thursday
morning. In pursuance of information received
by him from parties who had consulted the
District Attorney and Mr. Auble and arrange
ments were made for the prosecution. This
defendant, acting as Deputy Constable of the
township, went with others to the Hall ranch â
now this, mark you. was on Thursday morning
â leaving Lookout somewhere between 7 and S
o'clock , In the morntng. They went to Hall's
ranch to make further search for stolen prop
erty, and particularly to find this calf's hide,
if, It could be found. Mr. Hall came home
from tome place, they having got there while
he was away. They had searched and failed
to find the hide and they asked him â¢ to show
them the hide of this calf. He refused to show
the hide or tell them where it was.' Thereupon
Brown informed Mr. Hall that if he refused
to show the hide or give them information in
regard to It he would have to go to Lookout.
Mr. Hall did not object to going to Lookout
Â¦with them, but merely stated that he would
not use his own team. Thereupon he was in
tormed by the Deputy Constable that he might
go to Lookout with them. Mr. Hall consented
and after a few preliminaries Mr. Hall got
into the wagon with Mr. Brown and others and
rode to Lookout, doing it pleasantly, cheerfully
and willingly, without any force being used,
violence or threats or harsh words or ill treat
ment whatever. We expect to show to your
entire satisfaction the falsity of the story told
by Agnes Wilson, the witness' for the prose
cution, that defendant struck Mr. Hall with
his gun, or punched him with it, and then by
the use of profane language told him he would
ha\-e to go to Lookout that night and that he
would "fix" him before he got through with
him, or language to that effect, which you un
doubtedly remember.

THREE CONVICTS
ARE RECAPTURED
Man-Hunt on McNeils
Island Grows More
Special Dispatch to The CalL
TACOMA, Jan. 20.â W, D. Snyder, sent
up from Idaho, James Carroll, an Alas
kan murderer, and Harry Davis, a Nome
larcenlst, were recaptured this evening at
8 o'clock by Deputy Sheriff Johnson and a
sailor from the revenue cutter Manning.
They are three of the eleven convicts who
escaped from the prison on McNeils Isl
and. The posse ran into the trio as the
latter were leaving the woods for tha
beach. Snyder and Carroll were hand
cuffed together and the party started for
the prison. When they came to a farm
house the sailor was sent for a piece of
rope with which # to tie Davis.
As soon as he was out of sight Davis
made a jump into the brush. Johnson
tired and Davis cried out. "My God," as
if in pain and disappeared into tha
thicket. As It was very dark pursuit was
impossible. So far as can be learned tha
convicts have not yet procured firearms*
or food and. must soon be starved out.
With Frartk Moran, who 'was recap
tured last evening, three of the convicts
are now in custody. It is certain the rest
have not left the island.
Two fast, launches are patrolling
the twenty-three miles of shore line,
especially on its northwest shore, where
at low tide the channel separating It from
the main land is only three-quarters of
a mile wide. Every member of the posaa
is heavily armed and has orders to shoot
to kill if any convict is discovered and
refuses to surrender.
The island is five miles long by more
than four wide and is densely timbered,
excepting a few cultivated patches along
the water's edge. Thirty-three farmers
live on the Island, but all are badly scared
and have barricaded their homes, for
fear the convicts will endeavor to rob
them. This wilderness is traversed by
only two country roads, making the island
an ideal hiding place If the convicts could
obtain food. It la believed that hun&er
and cold will drive them to the beach to
night in an effort to escape, in which,
event they will be recaptured. â¢. â¢

"The Princess Chic" has been liftedâ but
well liftedâ from" other operas, but alto
gether it falls Into one of the prettiest
and most tuneful light operas that have
been seen here. There is some more than
commonly good concerted work, ' ambi
tiously : conceived* and 'Well carried out,'
and there are a few very . pretty lyrics.
The- plot Is occasionally- visible to ; the
naked eye, and, while reasonably ingeni
ous, does not suffer from any too painful
originality. The. opera is excellently
staged, dressed in handsomest fashion,
and competently cast -from principals
down to the last chorus. maid. Even, the
comedians carry voices round with them,
and since dainty Alice Nielsen's day there
has been no such singing onMhe : local
Comic opera stage. The chorus owns some
audible_tenors and is drilled into a stun

voice and snap throughout.

lights to make his - appearance, and .was
simply hustled Into the enormity of a

Every time he opened his mouth to nave
another try at Mr. La Shelle's libretto,
the audience drowned him out with im
perious applause, until he had: said "How
' d'ye- do?" to : them. It was too bad, be
cause Mr. Leary had a nice little ora^
tlon prepared, that came off later "with
due honors, however, and in which he ex
pr/essed the private opinion of ;;; all San
Franciscans, "that when you -get away
from Market and Powell streets you are
only out camping, and. that's what -Teddy
Hartman means when he talks about the
"effete East.'-" After; referring feelingly
to "fraternal nights" spent with a large
portion of the audience, to his Tivoli
days, to 'Gene Schmltz and his new band
up the City Hall, with ex-Mayor Phelan

hearty "applause. -He has a good part- as
Chambertin, and ' acts with all : his old

At the time of his death Martin had dis
posed of all the 4000 acres of land wjth
the exception of about 200 acres, and this
property was given to the children by his
second marriage. It is said that the
owners of the land affected will contest
the suit, on the ground that the North
Carolina heirs had previously been settled
with by their father..
Many years ago. It is said, a woman,
supposed to be one of Martin's daughters,
appeared in Gilroy and saw Martin. The jr
had a number of conferences, and it was
rumored at the time that Martin had made
a settlement with his North Carolina rela
tives. The woman left town and nothing
more wan . ever heard of her. Martin
never spoke of the affair to oursiders, but
It is supposed that he confided the se
cret to some of his family.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 20.â The suit recently
brought by Emma Moore and Susan
Spragln, daughters of John J. Martin, the
old Gllroy pioneer, to recover property
formerly owned by their father, . is at
tracting much. attention in the southern
end of Santa Clara. County, where the
land Is situated. Title to 4000 acres Is af
fected by the suit,- and some of this land
had been sold before Martin's death. Ac
cording to gossip In Gllroy, the old pion
eer had expected trouble of this kind. It
is uald that he twice married Elizabeth
McPherson. the last time after his first
wife, Nancy Dalton Martin, had ob
tained a divorce from him. The statement
that none of Martin's relatives knew of
his whereabouts until three years ago is
denied by old â¢ residents of Gilroy, who

nouncing that smallpox . had broken out

disease.
To The Call correspondent Casson said
that he did not believe he had any au
thority to act, but that he had notified
the department In Washington, and was
confident something would be done im
mediately. -
Smallpox among Indians is usually ac
companied by great mortality. The first
thing an Indian does when he becomes
sick Is to cover himself with blankets
until he perspires freely and then Jump
Into cold water. When an Indian has
smallpox and follows this course he gen
erally goes to the happy hunting grounds.
The situation at Susanvllle is serious
and quick action will be necessary to pre
vent an epidemic among whites as well
as Indians. -

The office of the supposed broker was
visited but only a chair and an empty
valise were discovered. The can com
pany officials declare that the facts of the
case have been exaggerated, and that
their firm will lose, nothing. The Selby
people assert that as the scale was sold
to the fradulent broker on credit by the
American Can Company under a special
contract, the only recourse of that con
cern is to find their man and force him
to a settlement by civil proceedings.
Meanwhile the self-styled broker has dis
appeared with the proceeds of his trans
action and his whereabouts is a mystery.
Last Saturday a man representing him
self to be a merchandise broker with an
office on Third street purchased a large
quantity of scale, a commodity princi
pally used for ballast, from the American
Can Company. The price to be paid was
$2 per 100 pounds, the agreement being
that tie scale should be delivered to the
Selby Smelting Companv, and payment
made when the last truckload was de
livered. The supposed broker received a
check from the Selby people for $2700 for
the stuff, but instead of returning with
it to the American Can Company's offlc*
he cashed It at the bank and has not been
seon since.
The American Can Company of 214 Mis
sion street and the Selby Smelting Com
pany were victimized to the extent of
$2709 by a smooth operator a few days
age. The identity of the man is unkiJ%wn,

Judge Mogan in the Hall of Justice.
Mrs. Foote was very positive In -her
identification of the two defendants. A
.brother of Galvin was brought in and di
vided his chair with him, but Mrs. Foote
persisted in her identification of the one
under arrest.
*they "pulled off my stockings, took my
money, : and , left . me senseless. . As soon
as I recovered I notified the landlord as
best I could." ,
. "Never mind, that is my brother," is
what Mrs. Foote alleges Anita Clark said
in response. .. , .
v. continued : to - object," ; said Mrs/
Foote, ''when that young man â that one
with the red necktieâ punched me first on
the left side and then on 1 the right, side
of my face, and when I cried out, choked,
me and smothered me .with pillows. Then
In her room she said she disked Anita
Clark to assist her in undressing, but ob
jected to the presence of the young man.
Graphically Mrs. Foote , described the
"trip around town and' the -attempt to se
cure-rooms at the lodging-house Â¦ "across
the -street from the Strathmore," of the
unwillingness of the woman In charge to
give them rooms, a drink or two in the
saloon down stairs, and the return to the
Elysium. I She said the ' elevator Â¦ boy
would not let "that young man with the
red necktie," pointing to the defendant
Galvin, ride with them and. he was com
pelled to walk upstairs. . .;.': Â¦
Not .feeling well she asked "the Clark
woman to take her home, drawing from
a small -bag concealed in her stocking a
roll;of bills, t containing at least $400. She
gave her companion a $5 bill to pay the
score; and then a carriage was ordered.
A stop 'was made at a saloon on Geary
street, or Brooke street, and more drinks
were ordered. Then â¢ the carriage was
taken .again, the "brother," whom she
identified as the defendant Galvin, joining
her and Anita Clark.
Picon punches on the night of December
29 . proved the undoing: of , Mrs. Ellen J.
Foote, . the *> divorced -.wife of. Lucius II.
Foote, a ( former United States official ac
credited to the court of Japan, and "now
secretary of - the I Academy of Sciences.
Mrs. Koote, in;,her sick chamber. at St.
Luke's Hospital,, told Judge Mogan last
night the story of;' the assault which she
alleges was' committed upon her by Anita
Clark and Thomas Galvin, who are joint
ly charged With having robbed her in
her (apartment at the Elysium; 566 Geary
street, of $579 50 in coin and jewelry.
Since . the night of the assault Mrs.
Foote has been confined to her bed. Her
jaw was broken during the melee which
preceded the robbery and, although able
to talk last night, it was with much ap
parent pain, though very succinctly, that
she related the story of her wanderings
on that fateful night.
In order, that the rights of the defend
ants might not be, prejudiced by unneces
sary delays, Judge Mogan. decided to take
her testimony last night. He -was ac
companied by Assistant District Attorney
Harris, Clerk Fred Conway- and Stenog
rapher Daniel Long. The defendants were
present in charge of Detectives Dinan and
Wren, and were, represented by ex- Judge
Robert Ferral and Attorney : John J. Bar
rett,: who conducted the cross-examina
tion of the complainant. :-
Mrs. Foote was propped up in bed, her
head swathed in bandages. By her side
stood her former husband, who tenderly
ministered to her wants, as she told, ap
parently without reservation, of her ac
tions from the time she landed in San
Francisco, the day before the assault, un
til she recovered her Â«enses some hours
later in the Geary, street: lodging-house.
Attorney Barrett conducted the cross-ex
amination, but' was unable, to^ cause the
witness to depart from her original story.
On direct examination Mrs. Foote said
she arrived in the - city on December 28
and engaged apartments at the Elysium.
She called at her husband's place of em
ployment, and -returned home, sleeping
the next day until noon. Then she went
down town and about 7 o'clock went to the
Hoffman Cafe for supper. First she went
into the grill room, had several Picon
punches, and then went into a box. She
had several more drinks of Picon punch
and about 9. o'clock Anita Clark drifted
into the same box, and they had more
Picon punches and supper together. >

treat in store for you. I also saw Mrs.
Leslie Carter in 'Du Barry,' David Be
lascas new play, and it is wonderful.
The Republic 1 heater, where it was pro
duced, was purchased by Mr. Belasco, and
is one of the handsomest in New York."
â¢"I can assure you that I am delighted
to be back here again, away from the
trosts and snows oi the East," said she.
"1 was told that the sun was shining
eo 'strongly here that it almost burned
up ihe bouses, and when I arrived it was
raining. Just, my luck. I have been trav
eling- around with my husband, who is
doing a big business in Eastern cities, but
1 spent considerable time in Now York
getting a lot of new clothes. You should
see them; they are lovely.
"Yes, I have arranged for several new
plays for my â¢repertoire. Among them is
'Zaza,' by David .Belasco, which re
quires a. lot of stunning dresses. Another
})lay is 'Drusa Wayne,' by Franklin
i^'ies, which has created a sensation in
the East, and a new piay by Steele Mack
aye which is as yet nameless. 'Zaza'
Â¦will be the strong icalure of my coming
tcur ca the coast. I will return to the
city in the beginning of June, when I shall
open the summer season at the Alcazar
with White Whittlesey and the stocic
company. I cannot express to you how
1 long to face an Alcazar, audience again,
they are so kind and appreciative.
Florence Roberts, the charming and
popular actress, arrived in the city last
evening from the East, and when seen
at the Savoy she appeared to be delighted
at being back again in the Golden West.
She will soon begin rehearsals for a tour
of ihe Pacific Coast with a strorur sup
porting company under the management
of Belasco and ThalL The company will
leave this city in about three weeks. Dur
ing her stay in New York she bought a
large number of beautiful costumes for
tier already extensive wardrobe, and has
made arrangements with David Belasco
and other playwrights to produce some
new plays that h&ve never been seen on
the coast.
The answer of the administrators of the
Sutro estate to the contest of the Sutro
will filed by Mrs. Rose Morbio, a daugh
ter of the late Adolph Sutro, was iiled
yesterday. Mrs. Morbio claims that in
1882, when Sutro executed the will pro
bated as his last testament, he was of
unsound mind, and alleges still further
that the will executed in that year was
not his last will and testament. All the
allegations made by Mrs. Morbio are
denied in the answer filed by the admin
istrators of the estate.
There are but two of the SutVo heirs
who have consented to the compro
miseâMrs. Dr. Merrltt arid Charles Su
tra The other four children of the de
ceased capitalist are not concerned in the
matter, as Dr. Merritt and her brother
have assumed the payment of the claim
as a personal obligation, entirely inde
pendent of whatever action the other
heirs wished to pursue. Out of their
share of the Sutro estate the two named
will pay the alleged widow and her chil
dren the sum compromised for. The
necessary legral action, which will put an
end to at least one phase of the contest
lor the wealth of the deceased philan
thropist, will be consummated in De
partment 9 of the Superior Court this
morning.
The sum given Mrs. Clara Kluge-Su
tro for her children is based on the
clause in the Sutro will which gives to
each of his children the sum of $10,000 as
a first claim on the estate.
Mrs. Clara Kluge-Sutro is to receive
$80,000 from the estate of. the late Adolph
Sutro, whose widow she claims to be, and
her two children, who, she alleges, are,
the result of her union with the million
aire, are to receive $10,000 each. These
are the terms of the compromise of the
claim against the estate made by her
in her contest of the Sutro will. She
agrees, upon the receipt of the $100,000, to
withdraw her contest, and as guardian
of the two little ones consents to the
dismissal of the one she inaugurated on
their behalf.

Although the German census was taken more than
a year ago, the tabulations have been carried on so
slowly that it is not till now that a final statement has
been made of the population, which is < found to be
56,367,178, or an increase of about 4,000,000 in five
years, or nearly 8 per cent. The increase which is
much larger than was expected is attributed largely
to a diminished emigration owing to the good times
prevailing in Germany up to the census year. The
figures show an increasing preponderance of Ger
many over France and Austria, and she will soon be
able to stand alone and have no need of the triple
alliance. . ....
With or without the wheat tax, however, it seems
well nigh certain that heavy duties will be imposed
on many imports. Free trade will to some extent
have to be abandoned. The duties will of course be
imposed at first as emergency measures, but in the
end they will doubtless remain as permanent parts of
the fiscal system of the kingdom. Free trade has
been found inadequate to the needs of empire.
Hardly any question that will come before Parlia
ment at this session occupies more attention from
the British public than this of meeting the deficit in
the revenues. It is believed that every kind of direct
tax, from that on beer to that on incomes, is about
as hi*gh as can be profitably levied. Indirect taxes,
then, become necessary, and no sort of tax would
yield a larger revenue than a tax on wheat. Naturally
the Government would gladly avail itself of such a
chance to make both ends meet until the war is over
were it not for the fear of a revolt on the *part of the
working classes. . It is known, however, that the
British workman is none too much in favor of the
South African war as it is, and a tax upon his bread
would incline him to such a vigorous opposition as
might lead to the defeat of the Ministry when the
bill was submitted to the Commons.
The tea and the sugar duties would not excite
much discussion in a juncture like this, but a duty on
corn will -almost certainjy stir the kingdom to its
depths. The free trade movement in Great Britain
began in a fight for the repeal of the corn laws. In
the crusade of the time Cobden and Bright taught
the people that a tax on wheat was a tax on bread,
that it was tyranny, that it tended to the starvation of
the poor. They succeeded in making the corn laws
odious. They induced the British people to . enter
upon a career of free trade and to look, upon customs
duties as creations of the devil. As the years have
passed the average British workingman has become
more and more devcted to Cobdenism, more and
more antagonistic to any tax on corn. It will be seen
that the task of the Ministry in devising a means for
raising a revenue is by no means a pleasant one.
The South African war has, in fact, brought the
British face to face with an emergency that cannot be
met under the free trade | fiscal systeml Sir Robert
Giffen has declared that the income tax as now im
posed has reached the degree of encouraging fraud
and cannot be made to yield much more. He ad
vises a reduction of that tax and the imposition of
indirect taxes. Some of the leading newspapers of,
London follow the lead and suggest the imposition
of higher duties on tea and sugar and the restoration
of a duty on wheat.
WHILE Rudyard Kipling in South Afrita
lias been singing of the glory of empire Sir
Robert Giffen at home in England has been
calculating the cost of it Kipling denounces the
stay-at-home youth of England as "flanneled fools
at the wickets and muddled oafs at the goals." Sir
Robert estimates that whether they be fools or not
the British people will have to face a deficit of about
$50,000,000 in this fiscal year, and intimates that they
will have to resort to customs duties to meet the
emergency, since the country has already as heavy a
burden of direct taxation as it can bear.

The national idea is now so firmly, fixed "in the

there is [no need for any act of Congress' to give it
strength. ' ... The .rules of grammatical construction

Simultaneous with the report from Philadelphia of
the "disappearance of the old; landmarks comes the
announcement from Washington; that a resolution
has been introduced into the House declaring that in
official: documents , hereafter the' phrase "United
States''' shall be used as a singular noun. We are to
say the "United States is" instead of the "United
States are," as the fathers did. The cause for this
whimsical resolution is, said to be a recent declaration
of Justice Brewer from the bench of the . Supreme
Court that it is necessary in speaking of the United
States ] to use the plural form. Some Congressmen
do not . like the ? decision, and accordingly, they â¢ aim.
at compelling the United States Court and all the
grammars; of the land to recognize the national idea
by speaking' of the; Union as one nation instead of
several States. \ Â¦ ' ;'V
SURVEYORS employed by Maryland and Penn
sylvania to ascertain the exact line of the
boundary between them as : originally estab
lished have found almost all the old landmarks set
up by Mason and Dixon removed and scattered. It
is said to be difficult to determine the exact location
of the line. Some of the stones have been found in
use as doorsteps for dwellings and some, as grave
stones in rural churchyards. The okLstones, so far
as they can be identified, will be recovered andagain
set up' along the famous boundary. Thus the old
line will 1 be once more clearly established, but it will
never be Mason and Dixon's line any more, nor will
there ever be national controversies aroused over it
nor bloody wars waged along its front. , 'Â¦-Â¦Â¦Â¦
A VANISHED LANDMARK.
In a short speech accepting the position of, chair-,
man of the finance committee Mr. Nixon'saicl:",."I
will not accept; executive position to be a mere fig
urehead. I am not. presumptuous enough to say<that
I can evolve out of my brain methods and ways of
managing political campaigns;-: I will not say .what'
my -methods, are, nor what* they,;, are to.be;. but â¢ I
shall use every effort to. bring' about victory, to de-
That a man with. such : Jarge private business af
fairs" o'n his hands should undertake the direction of
Tammany politics in <this emergency is 1 certainly un
expected. The' Tammany organization, however, has
time and again shown; itself capable of making just
such a spectacular display of reform from within. It
was believed that John F. Carroll, who was Croker's
right-hand man, would succeed him when < the boss
retired, but that would have, meant- a continuance of
the old sy&tem.of doing politics and would have in
vited future defeat. The boss and his followers have
been wise enough to perceive the need^of making
some show of reform in order to gain strength- for
the next campaign, and -accordingly Croker retires,
Carroll follows him, and Tammany is turned over for
a time to the control of the ship-builder who de
signed the peerless Oregon.. . :.
Nixon, in. fact, is not at all the sort of man one
would ever expect to become leader of Tammany
Hall. He was born in Virginia in 1861 and educated
at the United States Naval Academy. Graduating
at. the head of his classj he was sent by the Govern-.
ment to continue his studies at the Royal Naval Col
lege at Greenwich. In 1884 he was transferred to the
construction corps of the navy. He designed the
battleships Oregon, Indiana and Massachusetts.
Resigning from the navy, he became superintending
constructor of "the Cramp shipyard at Philadelphia,
but after some years of service there started a ship
yard on bis own account in New Jersey, making
his home in New York City. He has written several
books and holdp a high position in the business
world, being associated in the directorate or as con
sulting engineer with several of the largest corpora
tions in the country.
GROKER'S retirement from the chairmanship
of the finance committee of Tammany Hall,
which carries with it the leadership of the or
ganization* is riot accepted by the politicians of the
city as being in any way final. One of the reasons
for incredulity as to Croker's permanent retirement
is the character of the gentleman chosen for his suc
cessor. Mr. Lewis Nixon, the new chairman of the
committee and the leader of Tammany, is said to be
exactly the kind of man Croker would like to leave
in charge for two years, knowing that by the end of
that time the new leader would be so much out 61
harmony with the organization that Croker can eas
ily get control of it again when the next election
approaches.
Richard Croker has said that his absence in Eng
land for eight months was the direct cquse of the de
feat of Tammany in the recent election. It is sin
cerely to be hoped that Mr. Croker will let nothing
interfere with an extended residence in the British
Isles. It-might be well worth the cost for reputable
New Yorkers to pay him to. stay in Europe.
TAMMANY'S NEW CHIEF.
British military experts estimate that from . the
opening of the war up to November I there have
been sent to -the armyjn South Africa about 300,000
horses and mules at a .total cost to the Government
of upward of $62,000,000. It is therefore not strange
that the War Office has issued instructions that the
troops shall receive better training "in the care of
horses. Horse flesh in fact is too costly to be thrown
to buzzards.
POLYGLOT NEWSPAPERS.
The other money to be raised will be
for the purpose of assisting in defraying
the expenses of the encampment. Major
General J. R. Carnahan, who is the head
of 70,000 Knights of the Uniform Rank In
the supreme domain of the United States,
arrived in this city yesterday .-< morning
This latter amount, he said, is being
raised by four assessments on the lodges.
Three assessments have already 'been col
lected and the rest of the money will- be
on hand before the session of the supreme
body. A condition is that the $20,000 shall
be deposited with the supreme master of
the exchequer on the second day of the
convention. . He said "the money will be
there at that time without fall."
Lodges Are Assessed.
Before the offer was made to the Su
preme Lodge of San Francisco as the next
place for holding the convention j the rep
resentatives.. had a tacit understanding
that' the merchants of San Francisco
would Â¦ subscribe hot less than $25,000 and
that the subordinate lodges of the do
main of California would contribute $20,
000, the amount required by the supreme
convention for holding the same west of
the Missouri River line. .
Herman Schaffner, grand keeper of rec
ords and seal of the Grand Lodge, and
secretary of the general executive com
mitteeâcomposed of the following named
in addition to himself, Charles L. Patton,
P. G. C, president; George Samuels, S.
R.; A. G. Booth, P. G. C; H. R. Arndt, P.
G. C; Walker C. Graves, S. R.; Brigadier
General C. F. McGlashan and Jacob Sam
uelsâsaid yesterday that there had never
been any doubt in his mind or that of
his fellow committeemeh about the ability
of San Francisco fulfilling its obligation
and promises made to the Supreme Lodge
and the Uniform Rank. â¢
General Carnahan,' commander In chief of the
Uniform Rank, has never concealed that he is
strongly In favor of Los Angeles for next
summer's encampment.; . Â¦ .
"In case the San Francisco committee should
not fulfill Its obligations and Los Angeles
should secure the supreme session and encamp
ment, I can see no reason why the $15,000 of
fered by the Grand Lodge of California should
.not go to the Los Angeles committee."
The local Knights, if they discover that San
Francisco has been unable to raise the money,
will not rest â¢ until they have the promise of
both . the :. supreme . chancellor and the com
mander in chief of the Uniform Rank that the
session shall come to Los Angeles. They es
timate the maximum cost of entertainment at
$50,000, of which it Is said $20,000 Is already
available. Grand Chancellor Calkins says:
Cost Is Estimated.
For several months the inner councils of the
Knights of Pythias have known there was a
question if San Francisco could meet the prom
ises that her representatives made to the gath
ering In Detroit In 1900 and the railroad has
taken the precaution to make tickets for the bi
ennial gathering of the Supreme Lodge and
encampment of the Uniform Bank.. which, It is
estimated will attract 80,000 visitors, with final
destination either. In San Francisco or Los
Angeles. s
The supreme chancellor, Ogden H. Fethers of
Michigan, came to ' the coast January 1 with
the- expectation of completing all . preliminary
arrangements for the conclave â¢ In San Fran
cisco, but was met by the statement that the
San Francisco committee' was unprepared and
he was asked for further . time. Mr. Fethers
was called to Honolulu and his final decision
was postponed until his return about a month
hence. The San Francisco committee had
promised to pay railroad fares and a per diem
expense of not less than $5 to each of the
members of the supreme session.
ONE "of the largest fraternal gath
erings that San Francisco has
had for years will be the biennial
convention of the Supreme Lodge
of the Knights of Pythias and the en
campment Of the Uniform Rank of that or
der to be held next August. For- more
than eighteen months the general execu
tive committee of the Grand Lodge of the
domain of California has been at work
making preparations for this event, and
everything at this time points toHbe suc
cess of the undertaking.
Notwithstanding the fact that there is
every assurance that the convention and
the encampment will be held here, Los
Angeles is seeking to throw a cloud over
the affair, as appears from the following
dispatch , from that city : .
Of course it is not expected that the whole scheme
will be worked out at once/- The objett of the com
mission appointed to devise, the, plans .has been: that
of formulating a comprehensive scheme for beautify
ing and adorning the city through all its growth for
years to come. Instead of developing as it were hap
hazard, with plans changing with each new adminis
tration,, the national capital will, be constructed
steadily along artistic lines clearly laid down, and
each successive improvement and new public build
ing will be in harmony with all that has gone before.
The advocates. of the scheme are sanguine it will be
adopted, and that'as a result Washington City will
become not only superior to any rival capital of our
time, but grander than the mighty cities of the an
cient world.
. In addition; to the grand boulevard the plans pro
vide fof blqcld of public buildings "on three sides of
the Capitol; lind another : magnificent group of struc
tures is designed around- the grounds of the White
House/fqrming a court:of:honof:.They also pro
vide forr a supjerb .driye'way r aiong â¢ the shore of the
Potomac, arid an extensive series of parks. One of
the \j chief features of the; plans 'is; that of the much
discussed memorial } bridge.- ~ As -projected the east
ernterminus of the structure" will be at the foot of the
grand boulevard, and it, will' extend- in a straight line
toward Arlington; V X: V
The plans have been recently submitted to public
view at the" Corcoran" ArtiGallery, and from reports
thaV.come to us it ; appea'rs the. entire aspect of the city,
will be virtually changed:- All that part of Washing
ton marked oh, the~east; by the ; Congressional Li
brary, the.nver'on the west, Lafayette Park on the
north and the foot of Maryland- avenue on the south'
will, with: the exception of. the' Capitol, the White
House, the Monument^the Corcoran Art Gallery
and the Postoffice building, ; be torn down and re
constructed. From the Capitol straight westward to
the river will stretch a grand boulevard. This will
be bordered by spacious parks, which will form the
grounds for the proposed magnificent system of pub
lie buildings. * ' â¢' â¢
WASHINGTON CITY, -except with respect
to population' and trade, already ranks with
the greatest capitals of the;Old World. ' It
equals any of them \in the number and magnificence
of its public buildings ' and in r the â¢ excellence of. its
streets and avenues. ; Plans; however, are now under
consideration which when carried out will give' it an
even greater magnificence and" enable it â¢Â¦ to attain
eventually an architectural grandeur that will place
it beyond rivalry. . \ , ',';Â¦" V
GRANDEST, OP CAPITALS.
Count von, Bulow .can; hardly have been talking
through his hat when he Â¦announced the other day
that while the triple alliance' is- a very pleasant thing
it is no longer necessary to- Germany; but' it is none'
the less a dark saying and hard to understand. The
world is wondering'whether Germany can count upon
Ru ssia or .would play' a lone hand in case the alliance
should break to ,'pieces. â¢ Â¦ ': .
It has been a matter of great good fortune that up'Â»
to this time the question has never been one of party
politics, nor one of sectional interests. Compara-.
tively few people have thought whether the Nicar
agua route would benefit the port of New Orleans
more than the port of New York. They have looked
upon\the whole enterprise as a national question.
They have favored it because the commercial and
naval advantages which will result from the opening
of the route would more than repay the cost. It will
be a misfortune if that feeling toward the enterprise
be now changed into one of wrangling over the two
routes and the development of sectional parties in
regard to them. Such, however, is one of the possi
bilities of the present situation. Senator Morgan is
repqrtedvtojhave already declared for "Nicaragua or
nothing:" If there be many more like him we may
as well expect a deadlock for-the rest of the session.
The great majority of the people of the United
States are eager for the construction of a canal that
will open up a short waterway between the Pacific
and the Atlantic coasts of the country, but they are
partisans of no particular route. They are aware
that the choice of routes is a difficult matter, involv T
ing the solution of many complex problems of en
gineering, navigation and . maintenance. They are
aware that several commissions of experts have in
vestigated all of these problems and that the pres
ent commission in its final report has;recommended
the adoption of the Panama enterprise. To the mass
of the people that report is acceptable, just as the
former report in favor of the Nicaragua route was
acceptable. In fact, the people wish .a canal, and
they wish it without delay. Consequently there will
be a good deal of disappointment if at this time, just
as everything seemed to promise an early beginning
of the work, the enterprise should turn awry and de
velop into a partisan issue to be fought over in the
Congressional elections.
In addition to the possible divergence of interests
between the different sections of the Union there is
the clear antagonism between the interests of two
great corporations to provoke that contest and pro
long it. It is "hardly likely there will ever'. be more
than one canal across the isthmus. If the United
States construct a canal across Nicaragua the stock
of the Panama Company would become worthless and
all the money and labor expended on the canal would
be wasted. On the other hand, should the Govern
ment purchase the property of the Panama Company
then whatever hope the Maritime Canal Company
of Nicaragua has of obtaining from the United
States compensation for work done on that route
would vanish. The interests of the two. corporations
are irreconcilably adverse. It is, then, a foregone con
clusion that each will have a strong lobby at Wash
ington and that the fight between them will be fierce
and bitter.
R' EPORTS'from Washington are by no means
encouraging to the hopes, of. those who desire'
;. to see work on the isthmian canal begun dur
ing the present year. There is now danger that the
conflict between the advocates of the Panama route
and those of the* Nicaiagua route will be prolonged
through the whole of this session of .Congress.
There is even a possibility that the issue may become
a sectional one, for while the Nicaraguan route
would be more beneficial to the Southern States and
to the Pacific Coast, and perhaps to the Union as a
whole if all kinds of traffic be taken into considera
tion, still the 'Panama route has advantages for. the
Eastern States in some respects that the more north
ern route does not offer. * ' - . >
THE ISTHMIAN CANAL QUESTION;
Notwithstanding the. vigor of that assertion, the
opinion prevails ' that after Vall'Mr. Nixon will find
himself nothing more than a figurehead. It is said
that none knows better than Croker himself .that such
a man as Nixon cannot ' make himself valuable \ to
Tammany. In fact, one politician representing the
Hill faction of the ; Democracy of r the State is re
ported to have estimated Vhe situation in, this way :
"Nixon is young and energetic. He is clean and has
a good reputation. That is the reason Croker put
him in.:; Thcre.will bet little to "dp: for the next.two
vear . s .-. . Nixcm may. be to tworry along .for -that
length of time .without a riipiure ;with certain pow

and I make this predictionâ that two years from now

AMERICANS ON GUARDâ D. M., Point
Arena, Mendocino County, Cal. "Put
none but Americans on guard to-night"
was one of the mottoes of the Know
Nothings. This sentence was the counter
sign on the eve of an important battle
of the Revolutionary War. It has by
some historians been attributed to Wash
ington, by others to Israeli Putnam, who
was the chief of the Sons of Liberty. That
it was used as a countersign there is no
doubt, but who Issued the countersign has
never been definitely settled.
HOMES FOR OLD PEOPLEâ C. F. M.,
Berkeley, CaL The following are the ad
dresses of homes for ' old people In San
Francisco: Old Ladies* Home (Protestant
Episcopalian), Golden Gate avenue, be
tween Central and Masonic avenues; Old
People's Home, Pierce and Pine streets;
Old Ladies' Home, Mound University; St.
Patrick's Home for Old Men, St. Mary's
Hospital; Hebrew Homo for Aged and
Disabled, 507 Lombard street. There is
also the German Altenheim at Fruitvale
(East Oakland).
TEACHERâ N. N., City. For a position
as a teacher in the public schools In the
Philippine Islands file application with
the recorder of the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley, and it will be transmit
ted to the proper authorities. Would sug
gest, however, that your composition and
spelling as appears in letter of Inquiry
will not recommend you for the position
of a teacher In any school.
SERMONS AT FUNERALS-^J. S.. Ala
meda, Cal. It is probable that the ancient
Egyptians were the first to have funeral
sermons. The body of the dead, before
being taken to the place of burial, was
carried before forty-two judges, who in
quired into the virtues and vices of the de
ceased. If the judges rendered a favora
ble verdict, the relatives pronounced eulo
gies upon'the dead.
BOUNTIESâ Subscriber, Hayfork, Cal.
The general law of the State gives coun
ties the right to offer bounties for the.
destruction of destructive animals. ; .You
should write to the clerk of the Board of
Supervisors of the county in which you
live to ascertain if the board had offered
a bounty for the killing of panthers or
mountain lions.
BRITISH COLUMBIAâ P. B. S., City.
British Columbia and Vancouver Island
became Independent crown colonies in
1858. and remained such until 1866, when
they were united under one government.
In, 1S71 British Columbia entered the con
federation and is now a part of the Do
minion of Canada.
COIN AND PAPER.â C. K. City. A
Columbian half dollar of 1392 commands a
premium of 10 cents. There were no 50
cent greenbacks of 180L Until you de
scribe the 25-cent fractional currency you
have, it will be impossible for this de
partment to state if it la valued at more
than its face.
At the convention" held In Detroit in
1900 nearly 200,000 people visited that city
during Knights of Pythias week, and. in
1S98 a like number crowded Into Indian
apolis.
. Ex-President Dohrmann of. the Mer
chants' Association said that when the
matter was broached about two years
ago the directors pledged to do all in
their power , to Â¦ assist in raising the
amount that might be "required for tho
Knights of Pythias week. â¢
Dr. Arndt of the general committee said
that he is fully satisfied that the mer
chants of San Francisco, knowing' that
nearly eighty thousand people will be in
this city for more than a week, will pot
allow them to go to Los Angeles.- Ine
matter as to Los Angeles is conditional,
and all those Interested feel confident
that the convention and encampment will
be held here and the people of Los An
geles will not be required to put up $30,000,
which they offered if the convention and
camp goes to that city.
The major general said that he had no
doubt about the ability of San -Francisco
to come up to â¢ the requirements for the
camp. Furthermore, he stated that the
various organizations, for more than a
year, when the California trip was
broached, have been laying aside a fund
to spend in the Golden State.' One organ
ization In Indiana recently held a street
fair for that purpose and it netted more
than $6000. . ' ; ... -
There will be a monster parade, and
during encampment week there will be a
competition for valuable prizes, in which
thirty companies will take part. Arrange
ments have been made to secure the Me
chanics' Pavilion, which is to be con
verted- into an immense barracks for the
accommodation of the visiting Knights
and to protect them from the effects that
a change of s climate might bring about.
At first it was thought that a military
camp would be established at either the
Presidio or Golden Gate Park, but this
scheme was not favorable.
Monster Parade.
General Carnahan, who stopped at sev
eral points on his way to this city, says
that the Knights everywhere are most
enthusiastic and that outside of the con
tingent from" California more than ten
thousand uniformed Knights will be in
San Francisco. He said that from, data
received at headquarters it is safe to say
that an average of five persons will ac
company each Knight, so that In addition
to the quota of strangers from this State
there will be fifty thousand strangers
in this city from territory beyond the
California lines.

reviewed his action in fining Henry Pe
terson, owner of the launch Sibyl, $200 for
failing to display the regulation lights
recently while towing a schooner out of
Oakland Creek, and imposed a fine of S3
Instead. Mr. Peterson proved by wit
neEses that the failure of the launch to
show her lights was due to the accidental
loss of the headlight of the launch.
Henry Peterson's Fine Reduced.
United States Commissioner George E.
Morse filed his report yesterday in the
matter of the limitation in liability of the
Pacific Coast Company and the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company for the loss
of the .steamship Wana Walla on Jan
uary 2. The Commissioner finds that the
Pacific Coast Company was and is the
owner of the Walla Walla, and that the

He will be brought back, and with the
priors against him the probability is that
he will get life imprisonment. He is sus
pected of being- implicated with Case and
Kelly, who are also ex-convicts, in a
number of recent hold-ups In Los An
geles. Case and Kelly will also be brought
back to the Alameda jail.
Myrtle has served a number Â¦ of terms
for petty larceny and a term of three
years in San Quentln for burglary and a
term of ten years for grand larceny, also
a term of four years in Folsom for -an
attempt to. commit burglary. He had only
been released a few days on the last
named charge when he was arrested for
the burglary in Dunbar's room.
Myrtle was arrested on April 11, 1899,
for breaking into the room of F. A. Dun
bar at 1316 Market street. He was con
victed" by a jury of burglary in the first
degree on June 20, and after several con
tinuances appeared for sentence on
July 18.
W. Daly, who was then bailiff in Judge
Lawlor's court, had been warned to look
out for Myrtle, as he was a slippery cus
tomer, but Daly thought it would be im
possible for him to play any trick on him.
There were other prisoners . in the dock,
and when Myrtle's case was called he had
disappeared. The police were notified, but
no trace of the escaped prisoner could be
found. /
One of the suspected footpads arrested
in Los Angeles Sunday along with Prank

A famous professor in Jefferson Medical College used to advise his students:
"Trust in God and keep your bowels open!".. That's God's own wisdom, for
when the bowels are regular and the digestion strong and healthy, then the sys-

Stomach and brain affect each other. A sick stomach sours the disposition
and prevents sleep and brain rest, and a sick brain sours the stomach and clogs
the bowels. > Men of sedentary habits, brain workers who don't get much
exercise, have sick stomachs and bowels, and wear out their brains and nerves.

NEW YORK. Jan. 20. â Last week'a depress
ing factors in the stock market were fortified
to-cay by the engagement of $350,000 In gold
for export. This wai practically In line of
the development in the stock market, which
continued in its rule of dullness and profes
sionalism. Prices are generally lower on the
day, though not as low as they were during
the session. The continued discussion of thÂ»
affairs of the trolley syndicate and occasional
changes In â¢ the plans of the adjustment com
mittee keen uj> the disturbing- effect of that
episode. The enecial heaviness of the Atchl->
sons end of New York Central to-day was due
to the dissatisfaction > felt In the capital ex
pansion and new bond issue with prior claims
over stocks. The news from the West of much
needed rain and enow In the winter wheat
belt. was without effect. Reports of threatened
damage to . winter wheat from lack of moist
ure have geen offered as causes of some of the
recent degression of railroads stocks. - Con
siderable Interest attaches to ' the f crelem sit
uation just at present owing- to the signs of
speculative revival abroad. It Is evident that
the Ions liquidation in Germany has now prog
ressed to a point where accumulated capital
is becoming burdensome again, but the ardor
of Inquiry by German cap! tallsts. seems to be
directed toward tlielr own nubile loans and,
to some extent, to the revived Kaffir market
in London. The London market Is obviously
discounting with preater faith than In a long
time the end of the Boer war, but their in
terest In speculation also turns toward South
African securities and toward home railways,
ivhich begin to show signs of recovery on
rne offerings and promise of . dividends. There
is pven organized efforts to Induce American
capitalists to embark In Kaffirs. These symp
toms suggest the Inquiry whether the next re
vival of active speculation will not be shifted
to forelen markets and foreign securities.

Provisions opened- fairly strong, on an Im
proved hog market and the early strength in
coarse grains, but when I wheat - bepke . I badly
selling became general. May pork closed 17VÂ£c
down, lard 10c lower and'Hbs 10@12%c down.
The leading futures ranged as follows: .
Oats had an early bullish market. . Corn
was the leading Influence, however, ' and
brought a late break. May oats, closed %c
down at 45%c. . ' ; .
Corn showed unusual early strength, consid
ering the weakness I in wheat. Cables were
higher and on the theory, that the snow and
colder weather predicted ' would . necessitate
heavy feeding to btock traders began to buy in.
This strength, however/ could not stand against
the bad break In wheat. May closed weak,
l%c down, at 63%Â©03%c.
CHICAGO, Jan. 20.â At the opening in wheat
there was an attempt made to support the
market on the, early small, break,' but it was
of no avail. Cables were higher, but a small
rally, was poorly held. Everywhere In the suf
fering winter wheat country . relief was
at hand. ) Light â¢ rains . were reported
early with' promises of ' plenty of
moisture. Later enow fell j In several
States and every indication pointed to an end
of the drought. Additional bearish news, ar
rived in the shape of the weekly world's statis
tics. These influences set long holders to un
loading excitedly. Prices at outside points were
rapidly dropping under Chicago quotations. The
Northwest began selling here and St. Louis,
frightened at the prospects of plenty of. wheat
from, the winter country, dumped something
like 4,000,000 bushels in tbis market. Stop-loss
orders were executed freely and Hay, "which
opened %Â©%c lower at 80%@80%c and had
touched Â»0%c, slid to 7a y>c. The general opin
ion - prevailing among.- traders was /that longs
had overstayed in the market and must now
sacrifice profits to get rid of their, wheat. The
decline was unchecked and wheat was offered
openly from all quarters. Contrary " to former
breaks on this campaign, there was very little
demand at low prcles. May closed very weak,
1%@1%c down, at 70Vs@70Uc ;

Dealers- generally complain of being over
stocked. There is considerable diversity 'of
opinion among the trade as to where the mar
ket ought to be, some claiming that the goods
ought to go down to 20c for the best, while
others maintain that no more Eggs would bt
sold at 20c than at 22c. The carry over is
large, that for last Saturday being 065 cases
more than for the previous Saturday. Â¦

"In prunes the spot market continues firm
and quiet. Coast advices note a movement
cuicng the large packers to advance prices and
concentrate stock. Occasional business has been
done for forward delivery around the 3%c four
size basis for new Santa Clara fruit. Oregon
prunes show a moderate movement, but little
feature. In apricots and peaches we note sta
tionary but firm conditions. There is a good
Interest noted in bag figs. A lot of bags
has been sold at from 6'Â£c to 7c, according
to quality, for local account. Keg figs are
<-!osely cleaned up on the spot. Dates continue
firm and without special feature to note at
the moment."
"The feature at the moment is supplied by
raisins. A considerable speculative movement
has been noted In spot seeded, goods In transit
end in stock purchased but still on the coast.
Sales amounting to several thousand boxes
have been reported at a price said to be around
8c net for fancy, goods, it Is stated, being
bought in the interests of the coast syndi
cate of packers, several of whom are now in
this market. The heavy speculative movement
fcas engendered a stronger feeling among hold
ers, and some sellers have practically with
drawn from the market pending an expected
advance ia prices on the coast. Spot holdings
cf seeded are now believed to be largely con
centrated, and a similar condition is said to
exist in several of the large interior markets.
On seeded 7%c to 8c is still quoted in some
quarters for choice and 8%c to S%c for fancy
in cartons. Bulk is held firmly. On loose 3
crown is firmer at 6%c. with, however, possi
t!e purchases at %c less. Two and 4 crown
are scarce and prices somewhat nominal. In
Valencia layer raisins 7%c is quoted pretty
firmly. Stocks are in small compass, with the
market abroad on the parity of spot. Sultana
raisins show little imporxant feature.

the rate to |1, where it stood before the
Spanish war. The total reduction In rev
onues on this item would be $24,000,000.
The reduction on tea will aggregate
about 58,000,000.

received from the Austrian Government,
or any other! Government, and if
so, what', waa the nature of the

communication had been made to the
Government after | the outbreak of the
war. but that Immediately before, the. war
communications were received from other
powers suggesting the presentation of a
joint note to the President of the United

it provides for the establishment of a
zone around the garrisons, into which. the

said to be neccessary to prevent. the col

From San Diego and

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Â¦ LOS ANGELES, Jan. 20.â "It looks at
though the storm that manifested Itself
here on Saturday night has moved east
ward with great rapidity," said Weather
Observer George Franklin to-day. "It
now appears to be central over Kansas.
Los Angeles received about .13 of an inch
of rain." : ' .
Light frost occurred this morning in the
lowlands around Los Angeles, but It was
pt thÂ« white variety and did little or no
damage, so far as can be learned, it U
clear and cool to-night.
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 20,â Showers con
tinued in the mountains back of San
Diego - this forenoon. ' completing tn*
ratner generous rain which came on Sun
day morning. The heaviest rain was re
ported at liehesa, where, after an inch
and a half of snow, a warm, shower came
on, giving the section about an inch and
a half ot water all told. The fall at Ai
plne,: Cuyamaca and Julian amounted to
about an inch, and from that down to a
third of an inch along the coast. There
is much ground alreaay* plowed and seed
ed in the country and the rain will start
the growth.- More rain- will be . needed
immediately, as the ground everywhere id
very dry.
FitESNO, Jan. 20.â A sprinkle of rain
fell here early yesterday morning, but it
was barely sufficient to lay the dust in
the streets. " To-day ' the . weather was
cloudy, but to-night the sky cleared and
the atmosphere 13 cold. A good rain la
badly needed, but at present there are no
favorable indications.
BAKERS FIELD, Jan. 20.â Those' who
are much in need of rain and whose hopes
had been raised by - the rainfall .which
started Sunday j morning have been dis
appointed, and as the weather is now
clear and cold a continuation of the dry
spell is looked for. The storm was of no
benefit, merely the surface of the ground
being moistened. Although the rainfall
was slight in this city ana the surround
ing valley, there was a goodly fall of
snow and rain in the mountain sections
and feed for stock is now assured. At
Tehachapl four inches of snow is reported,
and throughout the Woody and Linn
Valleys country it rained hard all Satur
day night. Farther back In the mountains
there was a heavy fall of snow. Those
who have their wheat in have not as ye I
despaired of a storm which will insure a
good' crop. Â¦Â¦ ' Â¦
STOCKTON. Jan. 20.â The showers of
yesterday and the preceding night wore
followed by sunshine to-day, but it cloud
ed toward evening and by 9 o'clock what
promised to be a good rain began falling.
The rain is coming just in time and has
not been needed up to the last few days.
But .06 of an inch fell for the twenty-four
hours ending at midnight Sunday. The
record shows .35 of an Inch for the month
and 5.38 Inches for the season, as against
8.16 inches for the corresponding period
of last year.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 20.â A light but steady
rain began falling at 7:30 o'clock this
evening and there is every indication that
it will continue through the night. Sat
urday's rainfall amounted to v . 11. of an
Inch, making 3.1S inches for the season.
To the same date last year the rainfall
was 11.17 inches. The rain is joyously
welcomed by farmers and orchardlsts.
Although there has been no real suffer
ing, rain is needed so that seeding and
plowing may be completed. Grain already
planted and up also needs moisture to
give it growth. The recent cold spell has
kept the feed from growing, but a good
shower and warm weather will remedy
this.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 20.â Rain began
pouring at 7 o'clock to-night and con
tinued almost steadily from that hour.
The prospects are for a continuation of
the downpour -through the night. Al
though there has been no actual loss to
the farming community hereabouts, .be
cause of the absence of rain, nevertheless
the present precipitation ' is welcome. 'It
will be of great . advantage to the recently
sown crops. , '
SANTA ROSA, Jan. 20.-tHeavy.raln be

baud of New York to-day, fully. Identified
T. E. Manners', the prisoner in the Jail
at Gretna, as Edouard Kern Jr., his late
valet, who robbed the Thebaud mansion in
New York of $60,000 worth of diamonds and
jewelry. The moment Thebaud laid eyes
on Manners he said he was Kern. Man
ners made no further denial : of his iden
tity.. The necessary papers to take Kern
back ' to New York will be laid . at . once
before Governor . Heard, and that official
has promised to sign the extradition im
mediately. Klein and West, the men who
Â¦were arrested for' stealing Manners' trunk
from the St. Charles Hotel and who be
trayed Kern, will, it is expected, get off
with light punishment. Their case is to
'come up on Tuesday. Â¦ They probably will
be taken to New York as soon as the
hearing of Klein and West Is ; concluded.

A- landslide of gigantic proportions is
expected, but as the mountain is in the
outskirts of the camp, ho great dam
age ' will result.
j The men in the quicksilver mines ac
count for the phenomenon by the fact
that the mountain rests . on an Immense
bed of clay. The heavy rains seep
through to this stratum, making the clay
smooth and slippery. The /pressure of
the great weight of the mountain causes
it to move toward the point of least re
sistance.
Months ago miners in the "Washington
shaft became aware of the mountain slid
ing, and it finally became necessary to
abandon, all' work in that part of the
mine. The walls of the shaft are being
forced together. On the summit of the
hill there are great fissures twenty feet
wide, and these are constantly widening.
This moving mountain Is just back of
Spanish Camp and near the old Wash
ington shaft, about 1700 feet above sea
level. It is gradually creeping into the
canyon. \ Although the speed is less than
that of a glacier, It is feared the heavy
rains will accelerate Its motion and cause
a landslide that will change the topog
raphy of the vicinity.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 20.â Almaden has a
sliding mountain. For a number of years
It has been creeping down into a canyon
hundreds of feet below," and now it Is
feared.it is ready to plunge forward at
any time. The quicksilver miners in that
vicinity have been obliged to quit work.
ing Its Position.
Great Mass of Earth Gradually Shift-
AliMADEN'S SLIDING MOTTNTAIN
The point at which the slide occurred Is
known as the "Shady Bend." . The flume
of the Last Chance Gold Mining Company
Is demolished for a distance of several
hundred feet. Gold Creek, the stream
Into which the slide plunged, is a raging
torrent because of the recent heavy rains.
When the Seattle left Juneau an expedi
tion was being got ready to go Into the
basin to make an examination of the
damage done. :
"I .was outside at the time," said an
observer,, "and was startled .by the loud
noise. Looking in the direction from
which It proceeded, I saw huge trees turn-
Ing topsy-turvy Into the basin and a great
avalanche of earth rushing toward the
valley. The noise could be compared to
nothing but the deep rolling of thunder,
magnified hundreds of times. About half
an hour later another immense body of
the mountain broke loose and crashed
into. the river below."
VANCOUVER, B. C, Jan. 20.â News of
one of the most extensive landslides ttiat
has occurred in the northern country waj
brought to the city this evening by the
City of Seattle, which arrived from Skag
way. The slide took place In the basin
above Juneau on the morning of the 13th
inst., and was more than 1700 feet In
width. Residents of Juneau were startled
by the thundering noise of falling earth,
and those who were In the streets at the
time beheld a sight that Is witnessed once
In a lifetime. The entire side of the
mountain seemed to be tumbling, and
giant trees which grew far up the slope
came rolling down pellmell and crashed
with thousands of tons of earth and rock
Into the bed of the river. .

"The Fish and Fisheries of Japan." Pro
fessor Jordan- described the geographical

The board adopted the recommendation
of the Registrar as to the division of the
city irto election precincts for the pri
mary to be held on August 12. There will
be in all 113 precincts. \
Or must the Register to be used at the pri
mary to be held August 12. 1902. be made up
from the registrations of this year, 1902, under
section 10M of the Political Code?
Can the registration of 1900 and 1901, with
the additional registrations and changes, to and
including August 2, 1902, be used for the pri
mary election to be held August 12, 1002?
I respectfully recommend that an opinion be
requested from the City Attorney in relation to
said registration, as follows:
I am in doubt as to the use of the Register of
1900 and 1901 for the primary election to be
held August 12. 1902, as sufficient time will be
had to prepare for a complete new registration.
The question as to whether an entirely
new registration will be required for the
primary election to elect delegates to the
various conventions meeting during the
coming year or whether the registers of
previous years may be used before regis
tration closes, about six weeks after tho
date set for the primary, has been re-
Terred by Registrar Walsh to City and

said Baggett, "and subject ourselves to
the penallties of such a course. If the
grades are fixed we will bind ourselves to
spend the $25,000 required by the ordi

The Fremont Republican Club recently
elected the following officers for the en
suing year:'' ' *
Collector Stratton has no hesitancy in
saying that the. chief clerk must be gen
ial and courteous. Cress Unger has
been in the Custom-house- for many,
many years, and every year's service has
added- to his fund of geniality. Long: con
tinued service under the Government de
velops â¢ surliness in â¢ some, adipose In
many and geniality in but few. Charles
H. Blinn, who is backed by General
Barnes, is on the list of genials and like
wise on the list of eligible*, v He has won
every- election for quartemaster of George
H. Thomas Post since the organization of
that band of veterans. Recently Colonel
Babcock was a candidate for Pension
Agent to succeed Colonel Jesse B.* Fuller,
but now he comes to the. front as an as
pirant for the chief clerkship In the Cus
tom-house. Alameda County, where the
colonel dwells, is the favored zone in the
award of Federal patronage. Four years
ago Oakland presented- several candidates
for Postmaster of San Francisco. - , *_â¢ s
Clement Perkins, W. B.' Hamilton and
Colonel . Babcock are not on the eligible
list under civil service requirements. Col
lector Stratton' inclines to the opinion that
the Secretary of the Treasury may take
the position from the list so that the
wants of all candidates may have impar
tial consideration.' â¢
The salary of the chief clerk was for
merly $3600 per, annum, but it was in
creased to $4000, and will probably remain
at the latter figure. The salary would
not be considered high In the New York
Custom-house, where ten of the deputies
receive each a salary of $8000 per annum,
but the figure is regarded as good in the
San Francisco' Custom-house.
The duties . of.: the â¢ office are important.
In the absence of the Collector the chief
clerk can, under the Jaw, sign checks fo"
money. The Government in various

LARGE FIELD
OF ASPIRANTS
SQUANDERS MONEY ALONG
THE "COCKTAIL ROUTE"
"Warrant Out for Oxen Heydenfeldt'*
Arrest for Disturbing the
Peace.
A warrant was sworn out yesterday
afternoon In Judge Mogan's court for thÂ«
arrest of Oxen Heydenfeldt. 1040 Post
street, on the charge of disturbing the
peace. The complaining witness is his
sister. Miss Eltran Heydenfeldt. His wlf o
at first wanted to have him arrested on
the charge of battery, but when ahe was
made aware of the fact that she would
have to appear and testify In the Police
Court she declined to swear to the com
plaint. So Miss Heydenfeldt swore to the
complaint charging him with disturbing
the peace.
Miss Heydenfeldt said her brother had
that morning drawn S3000 from the bank
and was, she had been Informed, spend
ing it recklessly along the "cocktail
route." Her object chiefly was to get him
arrested to prevent him squandering the
money.
Heydenfeldt is a son of the deceased
millionaire capitalist. Solomon P. Heyden
feldt. the contest of whose will occupied
the attention of the courts for a consider
able time.
Our. annual shipments of horses to
Great Britain have a cash value of over
$5,000,000, not counting recent sales to ths
War Office for use in the South African
campaign.
Inquiry among the members of the
Board of Health last night developed the
Information that any action the Mayor
might take concerning the board causes
little fear. The physicians treat the pend
ing inquiry lightly and assert that as they
were appointed for four years they would
in all probability remain on deck Â¦ for the
.remainder of their terms. Although* no
statement . to that effect was made, Â¦ the
inference was unmistakable that any radi
cal action of the Mayor involving the. sus
pension or. removal of the members of the
board would be resisted in the courts.
-That 'this, will . be a test case . to '. deter
mine the- powers of the Mayor in the
premises is a certainty. â¢'-.-'. h ~
' While it is conceded amongnhe poli
ticians that â¢ the Mayor has determined
upon the removal of the board, hia refusal
to formally admit that fact is based upon
the theory that he does not desire to give
away his hand in advance and thereby
supply the health officials with ammuni
tion against himself, and the use of
which must inevitably result in protracted
litigation. â¢ . â¢ ' â
The antagonism existing between the
local and. State Boards .of Health is also
being inquired Into by the Mayor with a
view of determining where the fault lies.
The Mayor holds that these bodies should
act in complete harmony, and that if this
is not the case the interests of the city
are not. subserved. Â¦ The management of
the , County Hospital,' which, during the
term, of the present board, has been pro
lific of considerable scandal, is a matter
which is receiving the attention of the
executive, with the sole purpose of fixing
the responsibility. That the Mayor has
been supplied with considerable testimony,
oral and documentary, on these points, Is
generally admitted about the City Hall.
Antagonism Between Boards.
That the Mayor has a surprise in store
for tno health oiticials nas been apparent
to hia political advisers and friends lor
some days past. Whether by accident or
.design, it Is^known. that" the Mayor and
several prominent State otncials held a
long conference a. few days since, at
which the sole topic of conversation was
the local Board of Health. Tne I Mayor
desired to be well informed upon the acts
of the board during the bubonic plague
excitement of three years ago. It is said
the Mayor was furnished with consider
able unpublished data relative to the op
erations of the board during that period
of v terror which resulted in the quaran
tining of California by all the world, and
that such action as he may take in the
premises will be largely predicated 'upon
the information thus obtained.
The Board of Health is composed of the
following named physicians: J. M. Wil
liamson, R. .W. Baum. V. P. Buckley, W.'
D. McCarthy, "W. B. Lewitt and James W.
Ward. With the exception- of the last
named all were reappointed to otticeby
Mayor l J helan j when the charter went
into effect two years ago, and under the
charter provisions their terms of office
are for four years. Dr Ward was recently
appointed by Mayor Schmitz. His fellow
members, notabljt Drs. Williamson and
Baum, have held office for five years. Dr.
Williamson was particularly active dur
ing the bubonic plague scare, and his
quarantine of Chinatown brought the
city into unenviable notoriety throughout
the East -and resulted, in a tremendous
loss to the business not only of San Fran
cisco, but of the entire State.
