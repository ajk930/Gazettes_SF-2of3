flect improperly upon anybody, his re
marks,.he said, being directed to the De
partment of Justice especially, for not do
ing Its duty In promptly investigating and
acting upon such a scandal as had de
veloped in this case, whoever were the
guilty parties. He Insisted that either
the Judges of the Circuit Court of Ap
peals of San ' Francisco were ' guilty oC
some Infamy, or the Noyes . party was.
He. felt it. his duty, as he had some re
spect for the judiciary of the United

arraigned ; so seriously and to \ see that
McCumber denounced the decision of
the Court of Appeals, as forty-eight page3
of segregation of testimony out of 3000
pages of closely printed matter. The conÂ«
elusions of the court, he said, were based
for the most. part on evidence which the
Senator . from South Carolina (Tillman)
would not give the least credence to. Ha
asserted that Tillman had cast seriou3
aspersions upon a man as honorable as
he wasâ a man whom the South Carolina
Senator -might meet outside the chamber
and there, if he saw fit, 1 call the Vila
names he. had applied to him.
* McCumber Replied that he had not ac
cused "the members of the San Francisco
Circuit Court of Appeals of anything
worse than prejudice, and bias. He urge*
that. he had proved this prejudice from
the record.
Tillman . Interrupted ' and Inquired
whether ' McCumber . did - not think ha
owed it to the Senate to give all the facts
concerning, the ""damnable corruption" of
certain United States courts, to which he
had' referred. - Â¦>*.';: ...i
That "Damnable Corruption."
McCumber * read the orders Issued by
Noyes^ â known as the statu quo
ordersâ upon which he said the Judge had
been convicted ,of ' contempt. "Why, hi?
asked, was Frost sent to prison and Judge
Noyes only fined. If both were guilty of
conspiracy? â¢ He opined . that it was be
c.ause Judge . Noyes' character would be
sufficiently, blackened by f .a fine and then,
top, out of prison he could not be reached
by a writ of habeas corpus. He referred
to what to his mind was appalling corrup
tion in Alaska. V -'---'" -Â¦ : i^'&&]
That was the reason. for Frost's convic
tion. He 1 simply, would not be a creature

McCumber of North Dakota said .he
had no desire to. prolong the discussion,
but most villainous charges had *been
made against menâ charges which;he,per
sonally knew to be unfounded and abso
lutely false.. He 'declared that * certain
mining syndicates had . desired - to obtain
control of th'e whole- (Alaska) country.

against Judge Arthur H. Noyes'' and -Al
exander McKenzie before the courts .^had
had opportunity-^ to pass' upon the '.merits

ple and who ha'd' reflected 'so- seriously
upon Judge. Noyes \ and"; "Alexander": Mc-

In a brief, speech Stewart reviewed the
ca se, speaking strongly â¢ against a Judge
Noyes and his actions'in Alaska: V .' .' .,
by. prejudice and ibfas. .He became ' in
volved in- a colloquy with Â¦ Senator . Till
man. who said he' appeared in the novel
attitude of a defender of- ihe. . United
States judiciary. The South ; Carolina
Senator had intimated that he
liver a speech on the Noyes case, .but. at
the conclusion "of McCumber's speech he
contented . himself .. practically '.wilvh, put
ting into the. Congressional Record tho
decision of the Circuit. Court of 'Appeals;
of San Francisco in the cases of contempt
against Noyes and McKenzie.' .. ". ' : ;
f The; members the Court of Appeals
for the : ninth circuit, he said, might be
honorable men,, but he was obliged to
judge, them hy . their acts. That court
had convicted_Judge Noyes while he was
;2000 miles away and had arraigned him In
most remarkable language without an op
portunity, of a hearing. â¢'.'
I Reverting ' to "the situation, .as Judge

clared-that: the' mining -syndicates had
madeevery effort, to bribe himâ $20,000 be
ing offered-, to .him â¢ in one sum.' - Finding
it impossible to' bribe him, the- syndicate
hired, "McCumber .asserted, a., man -to

..^Referring', to": the opinion 'of- the Circuit

that, four-fifths "of "It was. devoted: to the
discussion' of an alleged attempt at con
spiracy," between Judge, Noyes and Mc-
Kenzie; the greater portion of ' the Infor
mation concerning which came from San

no' man could conceive of a more heinous
judgment than this. The parties were not
conyictai of "conspiracy but of contempt,
and," in his opinion, ought "not to have

McKenzie', Noyes and Dubose.
McCumber, then entered upon an * .ex
tended-statement. of .the .'case 'against
McKenzie, going into, minute' details. He
maintained.' that the. order of 'tee" Circuit

outside of the statement of fact made to
It !n [ordering ..McKenzie ! to turn, over

He asserted that McKenzie's lawyer ad

did, he would be in contempt of an order

Little can be learned in regard to the
board's recommendation as to' the . loca
tion of camp grounds __ for maneuvers.
Fort Riley, Kansas, and Chattanooga.
Tennessee, are understood to have been
selected. Pennsylvania and California are
said to be the sites for the remaining t we
camps.
General Miles holds the viewâ and In
this belief other officers concur with him
âthat the laboring classes do object to
the presence of large bodies of troops on
the ground that the Government is at
tempting to overawe them,' : There is no
purpose, so far as .can be . learned, of
abandoning such a post. as Fort Sheridan,
which is convenient to Chicago, but which
will be used, if the board's view is adopt
ed, as an'- infantry post; If the board's
recommendations Â£^, carried out Madijon
Itarracks "Hii'd:^jir^'aJirgr* fearfacks will . be
retafned for nil).^, purposes, the reser
vation at Oswego^ay be enlarged and
old Fort Montgomery may " be' regarri
soned.' Fort Niagara will be used as part
artillery and infantry post. . 1 '
. Lieutenant General Miles and' his" asso
ciates on the ;bcard; believe that the
proper place for cavalry is in the Indian
country. Posts now near large cities are
to be retained, but' if the board's recom
mendation is carried out they will be gar
risoned by infantry. The report that
there was, dissension- in the board over
the Jocatioa of posts near cities is 'denied.
Its conclusions are unainraous.
There is no idea in military circles that
an Invasion is impending from the Domin
ion, iufthe board determined to recom
mend the assignment of fle'd artillery at
various frontier' posts because they are
considered proper strategical points cor

The steamer Queen City, which is run

wreckage from, the Condor, and the
British warship Egeria may return at any
moment.
VICTORIA, B. C, Feb. j 5.â More evi

Condor has been found. To-day a board
on which the letters "Conâ r" are made
out. although the sea has nearly obliter
ated them in common with the other
paint, was picked up . on' the beach at
Beacon Hill. With the board was the
torn rim- of the cap of a. British blue
jacket. The board was shown to Captain
Harris, the naval storekeeper, who said
that while it was hardly proper to Identi
fy the board as having come from the
Condor it was evidently the lid of a pro
vision box such as those carried on the
warship. The boardâ or, rather, boards,
for there are three morticed together and
clamped with two cross piecesâ is about
20 by 11 inches in size and had been paint
ed a dark brown, with white lettering on
which only the letters "C" and "N" are
plain. .The "O" is blurred, but the entire
name appears unmistakably to have been
"Condor." Â¦
The cap rim is unmistakably that of a
bluejacket's cap, being stitched by hand
and of the material and make exclusive
ly adopted for such purposes. It was

As onions are a preventive of scurvy,
they are now retailing almost at -their
weight in gold and the enterprising Gov
ernment official is reaping a rich harvest,
besides drawing his salary.
Flagg was formerly an Oregon * news
paper man and received the appointment
to his position from that State.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. \ 5.â
Nome's epidemic of scurvy is said to be
due to the speculations of a Government
official,, who obtained a "corner" on the
vegetable market. Prices of vegetables
have taken such a rise in the mining
camp that they are beyond the means of
all except the very wealthy.
According to a letter received here from
Nome, Deputy Collector of Internal Rev
enue E. H. Flagg bought" nearly all the
shipments of vegetables arriving at Nome
on .the. last, few steamers and had agents
buying small lots from merchants until
the supply of onions was entirely under
his control and his purchases ; of other
vegetables caused a serious shortage.
Since the close of navigation the poorer
class has been without vegetables, and as
a result an epidemic of scurvy is rapidly
spreading. . â¢

feature not heretofore alluded to. This

The section providing severe penalties
for conspiracies in this country against

Ambassadors and Ministers, as Chairman
Ray of the Judiciary Committee, who is
drafting the report, feels that great care
is necessary not to exceed, the constitu

within the States. . The protection ol for

sidered justified by the law of nations, but
it is not deemed expedient to extend this
to Ambassadors and Ministers residing;

THE SECRETARY
S.TOCKTON, Feb. 5.â Francis
' Hodgkins and Miss Mae Budd
were married at noon to
day In St. John'.s Episcopal
Church, Rector Clark officiating.
The interior of the pretty church was
beautified for the .occasion, the, florist and
decorator having been unsparing in their
work. There were 300 invited guests.
The bride was richly gowned. Little
Lucille Budd, her sister, was maid of
honor, while the bride's cousins, Misses
Edyth and Marion Brown, were tho
bridesmaids. The groom was attended
by his brother. Sydney Hodgkins.^ â
After the stately ceremonial there was
a reception in the residence of the bride's
parents. Owing to the serious illness of
the bride's grandfather. Judge Budd, this
was made a comparatively quiet affair,
only the relatives and immediate friends
being present. Mr. and Mrs.- Hodgkins
left for San Francisco, whence they will
start on a bridal tour of Europe.
The bride is the pretty ' and Â¦ winsome
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John E. Budd,
the well known' attorney and regent of
the State University. She is a niece of ex-
Governor James H. Budd, and a grand
daughter of Judge Joseph H. Budd.
E. S. Pillsbury of San Francisco, who
represented the court in the proceedings,
is in the city, but was not present to-day
and the Attorney General suggested the
advisability of not going into the hearing
without first giving: him an opportunity to
be present if he desired. All . the parties
acquiesced in this suggestion and the
hearing was postponed until February 8.
Attorney General Knox to-day gave a
preliminary hearing in the case of Judge
Noyes of the United States Court for the
Nome District of Alaska, who recently
was convicted, of contempt by the United
States Court of Appeals at San Fran
cisco. The Attorney General -has the rec
ord of the court under consideration and
it is expected that within a week or two
he will advise the President as to whether
Judge Noyes had been guilty of such of
fenses while he was in Alaska as to ren
der other service in that capacity unde
sirable, and if so, whether the offenses
were of so grave a character as to warrant
his removal. There were present at to
day's hearing McLauhlin, counsel for
Judge Noyes; Ralston and Brewster, rep
resenting the Wild' Goose- Mining Com
pany, which was a party to the trial at
San Francisco, and Frost. - â¢Â¦ '
Consideration of some of the amend
ments from the urgent deficiency bill,
which had been passed over, was then re
sumed. Just before adjournment the bill
was passed substantially in the shape in
which' it was reported to the Senate by
the committee. . .
Stewart criticized Judge Noyes' conduct
of his office. He said that he had -been
familiar with the law practice In mining
cases for more than half a century and
that he knew the policy of the American
people to protect the locaters of mines,
whereas Judge Noyes immediately upon
his arrival at- Name had appointed re
ceivers to take possession of at least six
new mining claims, following these ap
pointments by others of a similar char
acter. He declared there was no prece
dent for a receiver in a placer mine from
which r gold was being constantly taken.
If Judge Noyes was honest In his action,
then he was utterly incompetent.
With this parting shot Tillman con
tented himself with having printed in the
record the decision of the Circuit Court
of Appeals in the Noyes case, McCumber
having withdrawn his objection. â¢ -'.
Incidentally the South Carolina Sena
tor, saying that the debate had been pre
cipitated by the reading by him' of a clip
ping from a newspaper,' read a dispatch
printed in a newspaper charging Benja
min Daniels, whom the Senate had con
firmed as United States Marshal of Ari
zona, with being entirely unworthy to
hold that office. Tillman made some
scathing comments upon the Judiciary
Committee for passing such a nomination
favorably. He supposed that Senators
from the State from which Daniels hailed
now would feel called upon to criticize
him for introducing this newspaper clip
ping, but he did it simply to "hold up
the mirror in order that the other side
might see themselves as others saw
them." Â»
their side of the controversy, should so
into the record. .
Tillman said he appeared in the role of
a defender of United States courts when
he was on record as having made many
scathing criticisms of the Federal judi
ciary, but he remarked facetiously . he
would not be doing his duty by his clients
â the three Judges of the San Francisco
Circuit Court of Appeals, whom he had
got into hot waterâ if he did not attempt
at least to cool the water a-llttle.
The order to which Father Jacquet be
longs will look after his comfort. Every
effort will be made to cure him of his
malady and he will then be assigned to
light duties. .
A year ago Father Jacquet was sent to
Alaska for missionary work. He found
the country sparsely settled, out with
great energy he raised funds for the build
ing of a church and gathered all the
Catholics together for worship. He over
worked himself and suffered an attack -of
brain fever. By careful nursing he re
covered and again plunged into his man
ifold duties. It is believed that the sec
ond attack, which unseated his reason,
was brought on by overwork.
Father Jacquet was well known to the
residents of this city. For many years
he preached at St. Ignatius Church and
was engaged in the work of the Society
of Jesus. His labors were chiefly in the
prisons and hospitals and he brightened
the life of many an unfortunate with his
kindly counsel and earnest prayers.
Father Jacquet was born in Belgium.
He came to this country when a young
man and after completing his studies in
the university of the Society of Jesus at
Woodstock, Maryland, was sent to St.
Louis and subsequently to Oregon. His
v.-ork was of a missionary character and
he won many converts to the Catholic
faith. He was next assigned to this city
and took up his work with fervor. With
his kindly ways and sweet disposition he
made many friends and it was with regret
that his parishioners saw him depart for
San Jose to take a place in St. Joseph's
Church.
The news of the affliction that has be
fallen Father Jacquet vras a surprise and
a shock to the members of the Society of
Jesus in San Francisco. The unfortunate
priest was a member of the order and
the loss of his services will be keenly
felt. The first news of Father Jacquet's
lamentable condition was given ihe rev
erend fathers last evening oy a Call rep
resentative. Father Calzia paid a high
tribute to his unfortunate colleague. He
said Father Jacquet was an earnest work
er and was beloved by all who knew him.
On January 2 the man ' supposed to be
Goucher called at his store on the pre
text of getting a diamond. While the
assistant's back was turned the stranger
opened the showcase and abstracted $210
worth of jewelry. Â¦ -
Last Friday the same man again called
at the store with another young man,
shorter in build and with a small black
mustache, and Ott waited upon them.
The taller one wanted a gem resembling
one he had in his vest pocket. Ott was
suspicious of their actions and told them
to call again in the afternoon. They did
so, but Ott did not give them the chance
to rob the showcase and they went
away, telling Ott to send the stone to an
address on Stevenson street, and giving
the name of Gibson. There was no such
number . as that given on Stevenson
street. It was not till after they had
gone that the taller man's appearance
struck Ott as being remarkably like the
picture of Goucher. and his assistant in
formed him that he was the man who
stole the jewelry. The police were noti
fied and Detectives Harper and Arm
strong have been working on the case.
A. L. Ott, manufacturing jeweler at 121
Post street, believes that "Kid" Goucher,
the much-sought murderer of Policeman
Robinson, was in his store last Friday.
He saw Goucher' s picture in the news
papers and was struck by the resem
blance. . .- ~ . /Â¦ '

Spencer â Yes, your Honor, you have the pow
er second to the Supreme Court and can put
us ell out of the case If you wish. The court
insults Raker most outrageously. He is kicked
at on every turn and abused on every side,
and because he won't stand the abuse heaped
on him. he is punished for it.
If Raker can't behave himself, Mr. Spencer,
you must proceed with .the witness. I don't in
tend to be browbeaten and overrun by any one
In this court roora^ I have taken more from
that man than any judge bn God's green earth
would have stood. I do not like to .punish any
one. but I am not going to stand these insults.
I can put him out of the case entirely if I
wish: The law Bays I can.
Spencer said that he had not been pres
ent when the witness made his statement
and did not know how to proceed to tho
best advantage., Here Raker attempted to
return to the rpomi but was stopped by
the court saying: "Go back. Raker: 1
don't want- you." Judge Harrington conÂ«
tinued :
Spencer protested that it was not right
for the court- to- insult-- Raker- and not
expect a reply; that Raker had been in
sulted every hour of every dÂ«y by the
court and by General Post- and that he
could not suffer, the abuse and not reply
The court instructed Spencer to proceed
with the witness, who had been recalled
to the stand. * >
Tlaker â I notice you take occasion to insult
me and say I am dishonest when you are on
the bench. You don't say It when you're off
the bench. . â¢ Â¦
The Court â I will say it off the bench any
time you like. .
Raker â Thank you. Judge; thank you for
comparing my word with that confessed per
jurer.
The Court (to the Sheriff) â Take Jiim out oÂ£
court.
Sheriff Leads Raker Out.
Raker attempted to reply and the court
interrupted him, saying:
For God's sake sit down or I -will go crazy.
I will make, you keep quiet. Now stop it.
The witness was ordered from the stand.
Raker-rls it' not right for us to prove Hut
ton testified to a falsehood?
The Court â I would just as soon believe John
Hutton as I would believe you.
Raker, you are acting as an obstructionist.
I never saw such disorder and unprofessional
conduct in a courtroom in my life. If it con
tinues. I will send you to jail for five days.
â¢ Raker persisted in an endeavor to place
certain objectionable facts before the jury.
Sturtevant begged the court to stop him
from proceeding, but Raker persisted in
such a loud voice that Sturtevant insisted
that the jury be excused. He increased
the volume of his voi<Â»e to such an extent
as to drown out Raker and the court
had to rap for order many times, finally
remarking:
Spencer has frequently made the claim
that the defense cannot obtain justice in
Judge Harrington's court.
Walter Rucker of Lookout was called
to the stand and was asked if he and
John Hutton had not left Lookout on
May 23 for Tule. Lake. An objection was
sustained.
Spencer â It's none of your business why.
- The afternoon's session was a succession
of rows. In the matter of Stobbie's tes
timony the court ruled with the prosecu
tion, saying that the defense could im
peach John Hutton's testimony only on
material facts testified to by him, dating
from May 27 to May 31.
George A. Knight of Adin was called
and questioned as to the reputation of
"Bob" Courtwright, but as he testified
that he had not known Courtwright for
seventeen years an objection was sus
tained. Raker claimed such testimony
had been admitted before and Post denied
it, saying that the prosecution had never
argued a point with the defense unsuc
cessfully.
Spencer â Xo, and , you won't before this
court.
Postâ "Why? Why? I'd like to have an ex
planation of your remark.-
Raker, for the defense, claimed the
privilege of addressing a few words to
the court, but started off with such a
tirade of abuse of John Hutton that Post
objected and Raker was told by the court
to take hie seat, Judge Harrington being
fearful ttfat the jury in the next room
would hear what Raker was saying. Ra
ker begged to be allowed to proceed and
the court was about to grant the request
when Raker said, addressing the court:
"For God's >ake, if you all keep quiet
I will continue my argument."
Judge Harrington was very indignant
and ordered the jury brought back to the
room and declared a recess.
Raker Denounces Hutton.
Argument as to whether witness Stol>~
bie .should be permitted to answer the
questions asked him by the defense as to
whether he saw John Hutton near Tule
Lake on May 15 was resumed this morn
ing and continued up to the noon recess,
the jury being excused "from the room.
In his direct and cross examination Hut
ton had testified that he was in Lookout
from May 15 to 31 and accounted for his
actions for every day during that period.
One rather amusing feature of the day's
proceedings was Raker's attempt to get
alleged extraneous matter before the jury
after the latter had been- removed to a.
side room during an argument. When
the jury had retired Raker raised his
voice so that it might penetrate the wall
that separated him from the twelve men,
whereat Judge Harrington's ire arose to
the boiling point. -">'/
ALTURAS, Feb. 5.â Another day of ex
citement in,the trial of James W. Brown,
the alleged Lookout lyncher, ended this"
afternoon .In Attorney John K. Raker be
ing ejected from the courtroom for re
senting remarks addressed to him by
Judge Harrington. Raker declared that
Judge Harrington was constantly taking
advantage of his position on the bench
to insult the attorneys for the defense,
and added that Harrington would not
dare use the insulting language out ef
court. The Judge angrily exclaimed thai
he was ready to repeat his words at any
time and place Raker might name.

Rev. Father Jacquet nas been engaged
as a missionary priest for the past twen
ty-eight years. He formerly lived in Spo
kane and also in, Idaho and California,
wnere he was always earnest in the work
of the church. He went to Nome last
July and immediately* commenced the
construction of a church and parochial
house, which were built entirely tnrough
his efforts.
PORTLAND. Or., Feb. 5.-In a late copy
of the Nome Xugget, receved by C. D.
Cederburg in this city, the first news of
the temporary Insanity of the Rev. Fath
er A. Jacquet, who is well known in Port
land and in California, is received. In the
issue of November 6 the Nugget states
that an order was issued by Judge Wick
ersham to inquire into the alleged insan
ity of Father Jacquet of St. Joseph's
Church. For two weeks previously Fath
er Jacquet had shown signs of insanity.
United States Marshal Richards placed
the priest in custody of D. M. Brogan to
await his examination. The hearing was
held at once, and after a number of wit
nesses haa oeen examined the court di
rected that under the circumstances
Father Jacquet must be given treatment,
and he was formally committed to the
Oregon State insane asylum.

No Argument Needed.
Every Sufferer From Catarrh
Knows That Salves, Lotions,
Washes, Sprays and
Douches Do Not Cure.
, Powders, lotions, salves, sprays and Inhalers
cannot really cure Catarrh, because this dls-
1 ease is a blood disease, and local applications.
If theyaccompllsh anything at all, simply give
transient relief.
The catarrhal poison Is In the blood and the
mucous membrane of the nose, throat and
trachea tries to relieve the system by secret-
ing large quantities of mucus, the discharge
sometimes closing up the nostrils, dropping
Into the throat, causing deafness by closing the
Eustachlan tubes, and After a time causing
catarrh Ol stomach or serious throat and lung
trouble. â¢
A remedv to really cure catarrh must be an
Internal remedy which will cleanse the blood
from \ catarrhal poison and remove the fever
and congestion from' the mucous membrane.
The best and most modern remedies for thts
purpose are antiseptics scientifically known as
Eucalyptol, Gualacol, Sanyuinaria and Hydras-
tin and while each of these have been success-
fully used separately, yet it has been difficult
to get them all combined in one palatable, con-
venient and efficient form.
The manufacturers of tbe new catarrh cure.
Stuart'8 Catarrh Tablets, have succeeded ad-
mirably In accomplishing this result. They are
large, pleasant tasting , lozenges, to be dis-
solved in the mouth, thus reaching every part
of the mucous membrane of the throat and
finally the stomach.
Unlike many catarrh remedies Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets contain no cocaine, opiate or any
Injurious drug whatever and are equally bene-
ficial for little children and' adults. ,
- Mr. C. R. Rembrandt of Rochester, N T
says: "I know of few people who have suf-
fered as much as I from Catarrh of the head
throat and stomach. I used sprays. Inhalers
and powders for months at a time with only
slight relief, and had no hope of cure. I had
not the means to make a change of climate
which seemed ray only chance of cure.
"Last spring Iread an account of. some re-
markable cures made by Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets and promptly bought a fifty cent box from
my druggist and obtained such positive benefit
from that one package that I continued to Sse
them daily, until I now consider myself en-
tirely free from the -disgusting annoyance of
catarrh; my head Is clear, my digestion all I
could ask and my hearing, which had begun
to fall as a result of the catarrh, has greatly
improved, until I feel I can hear m win IÂ»
ever. They are a household necessity Va "m

Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are sold by drue
gists at 50 cent* for complete treatment
for convenience, safety and prompt results Â«wÂ£

LONDON, Feb. 5.â The Associated Pres3
has the htghest official authority tor
denying the story printed by the Kreuz
Zeitung of Berlin to-day as to the part
taken by Lord Pauncefote, the British
Embassador at Washington. In the Span
ish-American war intervention, In spite of
the confirmation of the story by the Ger
man Foreign Office.
Afterward, in June and July, while the
United States was making great progress in the
Philippines. England tried to induce the Span
ish commission in England to ask for peace
proposals, for to no power was the American
encroachment in the Pacific , more annoying
than to England. i
The above is the historical connection of
events. We hope that In giving the same we
have thoroughly exposed the absurdity of the
English legend.
Diplomatic circles, however, entertained no
illusions, and when England. April 14, through
her Embassador. proposed a new collective
note,- in which the powers should declare that
Europe regarded America' 9 armed intervention
in Cuba as unjustifiable, the other Embassa
dors telegraphed to their home governments
asking lor instructions. The step failed
through Germany's positive refusal. This
gives, as It appears to us, a picture essentially
different from the English statement. A fort
night later war was declared.
We are unable to state the details of how
the united action came about* At any rate,
the collective note was handed to the officials
at Washington April 7, advising a peaceable
settlement, and was signed by England.
France. Italy. Austria. Russia and Germany.
It was believed for a week that the war would
be. averted. General Blanco received orders
from Madrid to offer the Cuban insurgents an
armistice, for Spain was resolved to give them
far-reaching autonomy, and to arrive at a
settlement .of the Maine question through ar
bitration.
After that several attempts were made to
win Germany, or the Dreibund, for interven
tion, in which tbe Pope was especially active.
The final result waa that Dr. von HoUeben
(German Embassador to the United States)
was instructed to join in the step proposed by
Austria, only in case all the other flvÂ« great
powers participated. . . . â¢
This was in the weeks following ' the sad
catastrophe of the Maine, when it waa be
lieved intervention would facilitate an under
standing between the United States and Spain.
Nevertheless our Government commissioned
Herr von Radowitz, the German Embassador
to Spain, to inform the Madrid Government
that Germany was not in a position to -prevent
the Spanish-American war. â¢
- Almost exactly four years ago the Spanish
Embassador here asked Germany whether Ger
many would lead In action against the United
States for the protection of the monarchic prin
ciple. The answer was a definite refusal, and
the same answer. was given a month later, 'or
about the middle of March, when the Invita
tion reached Germany td participate in the
intervention undertaken upon the initiative of
Austria.

the manholes. Fearing further explosions
the people rushed down the street, manv

several street cars near the place the
windows were smashed, and the passen
gers severely shaken up. When people
ta the cars saw the flames gush from the
ground all rushed for the doors. A num
ber of persons were bruised and knocked
down in the excitement. One car filled
with passengers was thrown from the
tracks.
.The cause of the explosion Is unknown
and it has not yet been determined
whether it was sewer gas or illuminating
eas. Mains ruled with the latter were in
stantly ablaze after the explosion and a
tuccession of explosions followed the
Hames shooting up through the manholes

or whether the mains were uroken by an
explosion of sewer gas.

structure, flared up, the next building was <

whole block would be wiped out before

Seven Members of One Fam

Victims.
Before the vote was declared there was
an angry anti-Cecil demonstration. Both
Lord Hugh and Evelyn Cecil used every
Parliamentary trick to delay reaching a
vote within the time limits of Wednesday
and when they returned to the House
from, the lobbies both of Lord Salisbury's
relatives were greeted with angry cries of
"Shame," "Churlish," and similar epi
thets. â¢ " t
Sir William Gurdon (Liberal) reminded
the Cecils that the bill did not provide for
compulsory "marriage with a deceased
wife's sister and he convulsed the House
by reading a letter from a woman friend,
telling him of a man who had married the
eldest of seven sisters. "What a terrible
thing it would be," said the writer, "if
this bill becomes a law and this man's
wife died. He would have to marry all
his seven sisters-in-law at once! It would
be no better than a harem."
The Cecils, as usual, appeared in the
forefront of the opposition to the bill.
Lord Hugh Cecil, fifth son of Lord Salis
bury and Conservative member for Green
wick, and Evelyn Cecil, also a family con
nection of the Premier and Conservative
member for Aston Manor, drew harrow
ing pictures of the disturbance which the
passage of the measure would bring about
in the happy relations of many a sister
in-law and how the comforts the latter
was capable of rendering the husband
when he had lost his wife would be with
drawn should a Parliament hint be given
that such consolation would be a step
toward future matrimony.
The advocates of the measure to-day
brought forward all the old arguments,
especially dwelling on colonial legislation,
which is considered to be an unanswer
able argument in favor of the bill. The
loyalty of the colonies during the South
African war is advanced as an additional
reason for the removal of the injustice
which the present law inflicts on a large
number of children who are the fruit of
colonial marriages.
LONDON, Feb. 5.â The perennial wife's
Bister bill reappeared in Parliament to-day

favorable report* on the treaty to acquire the
Danish West Indies. : No amendment was made
to the treaty In committee.
Further explanation was made to the
effect that the President had begun an
examination into the case on his own re

particulars concerning the man who was
imprisoned there and who is supposed to
have been Daniels, and by telegraphing
to Daniels himself, instructing him not to
enter on the discharge of his duties until
the charges made could be Investigated.
It was stated that there was some doubt
as to the Identity of Daniels with the
Wyoming convict. With these explana
tions the â¢matter was dropped for the
time. Senators generally express the
opinion that if the charges prove to be
true Daniels will be discharged from of

The president read a letter from the

that seamen are not obtainable without

Tuohy was taken before Judge Cabaniss
yesterday morning and the case waft con
tinued till this morning.
The policemen who pursued Tuohy
were W. Doran, J. L. Frary and George
O. Brown. They had reported off duty
at the North End station a short time
before and were going home when they
saw Tuohy. They determined to halt him,
as they thought he was acting suspicious
ly, and called out to him to stop, as they
were officers, but instead- he ran off and
fired the shot. The officers say that the
bullet from Tuohy's pistol struck the
sidewalk in front of them. â¢ .
Tuohy, who Is 22 years of age, came
here from New York about a month agb.
He says he used to drive a coach there for
Perry Belmont. Since getting employment
in Brooks' stables he has been engaged
driving a carriage for Dr. Levingston.
Tuohy had been drinking heavily Tuesday
night and left his room on Clay street,
near Polk, early yesterday morning to get
another- drink. Three policemen who
were in citizens' dress were standing on
the corner of Polk and Sacramento streets
and they ordered him to stop; at the same
time telling him they were officers. Tuohy
did not believe them and thinking they
were footpads started to run. The police
men gave chase and Tuohy turned into
Bush street and ran toward Van Ness
avenue. The officers continued , calling
upon him to stop. Tuohy finally turned
and drawing a revolver from his I pocket
nre*d a shot at the sidewalk with the ob
ject of intimidating his pOrsuers. They
closed in upon him, however, and He says
one of them struck him several times on
the face. Tuohy begged his captors not
to kill him and handed one of them, his
revolver. â¢ ! He was then taken to the
City Prison and booked on a charge of
assault to murder.
Thomas Tuohy, : a hostler employed in
Brooks' livery stable on the corner of
Geary and Polk streets, had a rather live
ly, experience early yesterday with three
police officers whom he mistook for foot
pads.
The programme is long and strong and
â¢will open with an act of ."The Pride ol
Jennico," from â¢ the California Theater.
A^ter. an address of welcqme by. Mayor

HOSTLER FIRES
AT POLICEMEN
In passing sentence the Judge said that
crimes of violence and robbery must be
stopped. When a man like the defendant
came into court on such a charge with a
prior conviction against him he must take
the consequences. There was only one
alternative â to Impose a life sentence and
rid society of such a pest.
The crime for which Murphy will spend
the remainder of his life in the peniten
tiary was the robbery of Harry Lawrence.
Lawrence was walking north on Powell
street about 3 o'clock on the morning of
December 2 on his way hftme, and when
he reached Geary street he was knocked
unconscious by a blow on the- head and
robbed of $2 10 and a silk handkerchief.
Policeman Braig saw three men bending
over Lawrence's prostrate form, and
chased one of them till he ran into the
arms of Policeman Bobl on Stockton
street- The man was Murphy. Another
The Judge sentenced him to im
prisonment for life in San Quentln. Mur
phy's face blanched when he heard the
sentence, but he did not u^ter a word.
Later, while in the City Prison, he asked
Sergeant Bidwell to be kind to his mother
when she was brought In for drunken
ness, . as she has several times been ar
rested on that charee.
JOHN MURPHY, who was convicted
by ft jury in Judge' Cook's court

Â¦ tuxor, 'A. R. Curtis* great greyhound,
will make his reappearance on the "cours
ing field, this week at'Union Park. 'â¢ He
was drawn near the top of the card in the
special stake/ while Sacramento Boy, win
ner, . of ' last week's stake, Is safely In
trenched at the bottom of the card. The
Geary and the Curtis kennels are well
represented, many of their dogs being
drawn together. The draw last night re
sulted as follows-
Miss Mary E. Casey, a school teacher
in the Horac* Mann School, testified that
there was a school vacation from October
4 to October 34 Inclusive. This fact was
Introduced to disprove the testimony of
Erline Piatt, who swore that she had at
tended school during all of the week pre
ceding the murder. Erline Piatt had pre
viously testified that on the evening of
the murder she was a passenger on the
car and that Buckley stood before her on
the steps until Twentieth street was
reached, when he sprang off and fired
four shots into Rice's body.
The case will be argued before the jury
to-day, and it is likely that the matter
will be submitted to that body Friday.
t'nder cross-examination Buckley grew
extremely nervous. He admitted that he
was arrested several times in recent years
for various offenses ranging from, battery
to disturbance of the peace. He denied
that he told Police Sergeant Duke that
he went to the Mission to visit a woman
named Sullivan. The statements of the
police as to remarks made bv him- after
his arrest were also denied. He affirmed
that when Rice made his dying statement
to Sergeant Duke the wounded man did
not say that a man wearing a white har
did' "the shooting. There being -vigorous
objection on the part of the defense to the
attempt of the prosecution to Inquire into
facts of the defendant's career not
touched upon in the direct examination,
the cross-examination was suddenly
closed.
Buckley was then shown the hat he
wore at the time of his arrest and be
haltingly said that he was not certain if
he ever wore a hat like the one intro
duced in evidence. He said It looked to
him as If It had been changed or .tam
pered with so as to change its shape to
resemble a Fedora, whereas the hat he
wore had a straight brim. He was cer
tain the clubbing of Rice was not done
by Moran.
Prisoner Grows Extremely Nervous.
It developed that the defendant was
once convicted of disturbing the peace and
fined $5. On the- day of the murder he
said he left his home at 3 Freelon street
and went to a saloon at the. corner of
Zoe and- Brannan streets, where he met
Moran, Donnelly, Duncan and two stran
gers. They drank together, and one of
the strangers said there would be a fist
ngiit in the Mission that evening. The
entire party left the saloon about 4:30
p. m. and made the rounds of other drink
ing- places, anally winding up at Second
and Howard streets. Here one of the
strangers said, "Jjet's take this car." The
stranger got on the extreme front of the
car oa the left hand side, Buckley taking
a place just behind him. At Twentieth
street, when the car stopped, Buckley
was amazed to see one man clubbing an
other. As he viewed the spectacle he 6aw
tue stranger nre two shots at the fallen
man. Buckley then took to his heels and
fled down to Shotwell street, thence to
Seventeenth street, where he was appre
hended. At that time a man told the ar
resting officer that Buckley was not the
man wanted for Rice's murder, but that
the crime was committed by a man wear
ing a black hat.
Tells of the Mysterious Stranger.
Buckley said he was 26 years old and a
native of this city. His father died some
thirteen years aÂ£O, and about that time
he began to earn his living at various
pursuits. He lirst worked in a plumbing
eho^ then in a cannery and for a time
with an electric company. In June last
he worked at a cannery' on Brannan
street, remaining there until September.
The defendant attached great Impor
tance to his own statement that the
stranger wore a black hat, notwithstand
ing the testimony of many witnesses that
the assassin of Mice wore a light one.
In a manner, characterized by. hesita
tion, extreme caution and failure to re
member essential details, William Buck-
Icy, charged with the murder of George
Hice, a non-union machinist, October 11
last, told his story to a jury in Judge
l^awlor's court yesterday. He placed the
blame for the crime upon, a stranger
whom he never saw before or since the
day of the murder. Buckley labored un
der a severe strain while he was testify
ing.

as neither the Secretary of War nor Lieu

there can be no certainty in the matter.
It Is probable that the military authori

tance of this department bjr giving It to
a commander of lower rank than hereto
fore. On this account officers now sta

talk of Funston's selection has no basis

District Officers Make Reports.
While feeling the tendency toward the mixed
clubs, I, cannot belfcve that they should ever
take the place of "the woman's club." The
hours of the day when it would be possible for
both father and mother to attend such a club
are Just, the hours when., the mother should be
at home with the family and not at the. club,
as the father should be at home with his fam
ily and not at a club of any sort or condi
tion. Eut I think' the women's clubs should
not iKr.cre the men as they do. and therefore
I nuggest that at regular Intervals they should
entertain the husbands and men friends and
give them a glimpse of woman's club life as it
really Is, and not as they do not. know it to be.
recognized, while the ereatness of Individual
club personality is a quality to be cultivated.

ALTHOUGH only a very small num
ber of the delegates attending the
convention of the California Fed
eration of Women's Clubs w%re
present yesterday morning when
the hour for opening the day's proceed
ings arrived, Mrs. Burdette. the president,
promptly dropped her gravel. As the hours
â¢wore on and the skies began to brighten
delegates and spectators dropped in and
Golden Gate Hall was comfortably filled
v.hen the hour for the noon recess arrived.
The afternoon attendance was excellent.
An amusing incident occurred during the
morning session. One of the delegates in
the rear of the hall suggested that the
ladies in the body of the hail should take
off their hats. This was donojon proper
motion and the president was nearly
ready to take up the regular order of busi-i
ness.
"I would suggest," s&ld another dele
gate, "that the officers on the stage doff
their hats."
Amid the handclappings of the dele
grates, Mrs. Burdette took off hers and
was followed quickly by all the others.
Then business was resumed. After read-
Ing the minutes of the previous session
reports of committees were called for.

' President Mjikes Address.
-Mrs. Solomon Jewett of Bakersfleld pre
Mrs. I. Lowenberg, the recording secre
tary," in' her report announced that at
present the federation was composed of
ninety-five clubs, Â¦ with a membership of
75C7. The work of the last two years was
thoroughly reviewed. The report con
cluded as follows:
It U a recognized fact that the trend of the
times Is toward â¢ co-operation or consolidation â
synonomous terms â which Is shown by the gi
gantic trustsâ trusts In commercial life and by
federation in club llfÂ«. It is practical and be
coming universal because effective. The edu
cational and altruistic activity of women
which permeates every hamlet, the wide Intelli
gence, the many vital things that surge around
them, requiring definite thought and unity of
action, render the Federation of Clubs a po
tential factor in molding public sentiment and
an absolute necessity for the mil information
of the sociological and humanitarian develop
ment of the times.
Some Interesting statistics , were pre
sented by Mrs. W. W. Stillson, correspond

of printed matter and stationery that
was sent out and the number of letters

Mrs. Dorville Libby read the report of
Mrs. Lovell White of the biennial local
board, detailing the work done by the
members of the board in arranging all de-.
tails preparatory to holding .the conven

by stating that eleven meetings had been
held and eighteen committees appointed.
Mrs. George W. Bunnell of Oakland read
the report of the committee on rules and
regulations. Speakers whose names do
not appear on the programme are to be
limited to three minutes and no member
Is to be allowed to speak more than once
on any subject. No delegate is allowed
to represent more than one club and

made in writing.
Mrs. Henry C. Bunker was appointed
timekeper by the chairman.
Mrs". Kate A. Bulkley of Oakland pre
sented the report of the programme com
mittee, as published.
While the State at large can never accom
plish any desired ends save through the co
operation and united effort of the Individual
clubs, certain lines of consideration there are
The work of these first two years of the

which they were elected, graciously and gen

I now most fully .realize that my term of office
would be to me one of but half accomplished
plansâ unsatisfactory attempts to keep In per
sonal touch with the work and the workers
across the thousands of miles stretching be

so well wrought out has been largely due ta
the well-directed zeal and the efficient labors
of the executive board and very especially to
your shle vice president and your more than

Work of the Federation.
Members of the State Federation of Cali
fornia and Yoke-fellows All: While this Is not
our first anniversary, It is our first birthday
party. Young as we are, we can not only walk
alone, but .we have learned to ask for what
wÂ© want, and if it Is not promptly given us,
we have ceased to cry for It. like babies and
have acquired the chtld-hablt of helping our
selves. As California is credited with being
the "exceptional State," from her climate to
her truthful narrators of simple fact, so her
State Federation of Women's Clubs can be
Justly classed as "exceptional" In the history
ef this club movement. With a State that Is
territorially an empire, necessitating a Journey
of one thousand miles every time the President
attended a board meeting â and repeated Jour
neys, that multiplied the mileage Into several
thousands. In response to the Invitations of in
dividual clubs, for reciprocal consultation and
thÂ« Inspiration of personal association; with
the strength and time of somer'of our club
women already given to similar though smaller
federations of club women In different sections
of the State, doing a similar, but more Isolated
work; with the â¢ "district" Idea, having six
throbbing centers of activity, thought, and pur
pose for the State, instead of one â which was
with us an organized plan In the beginning In.
stead of a growth, as in many of the older
Statesâ with a very rapidly and constantly In
creasing family, until at two years of age
we number a greater State membership than
any one of twenty-eight States in the thirty
six â with all these conditions, the difficulties
of perfect organization have- been Indeed pecu
liar and purpose-testing.
In her address Mrs. Burdette dwelt
upon what the federation had accom
plished and what it ought to do to further
the work ofÂ«women's clubs. She said in
part:
Mrs. Hermann H. â¢ Kerchoff of Los
Angeles, who is designated as the State
corresponding secretary of the General
Federation, was absent, and Mrs. Still
son made a brief report for her. Her
duties are attending to the correspond

sented her report as treasurer. It showed
that since the organization of the State
Federation the receipts had amounted to
$1829 75; the disbursements were $991 53,
and the balance on hand was $838 22. Mrs.
G. J. Bucknall of the auditing committee
reported that all the books and accounts
were, correct.
PRESIDENT OF THE FORUM CLUB. PRESIDENT OF THE PACIFIC COAST WQMEN'S PRESS . ASSOCIATION
AND PRESIDENT OF THE LAUREL HILL CLUB, WHO READ REPORTS YESTERDAY DURING THE AF
TERNOON SESSION OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF WOMEN'S CLUBS. .
â¢ The ' ladies of the Forum Club will be
at home- in- their rooms- in the Central
block, 223 Sutter street, on Saturday.
The programme for to-day is one of
the most important scheduled for the con
vention. 'The election of officers will take
place In the morning, the ballot box to be
open from 10 a. m. to 12:30 p. m. Business
matters, constitutional . amendments and
a plan of reorganization will be discussed.
But the most important matter to come
is the discussion of the question of the
admission of I clubs of colored women to
the general ! federation. The i debate will
be opened by Mrs. E. O. Smith of San
Jose, and ; Mrs. George W. Haight of
Berkeley. ,At noon the discussion will
close. The officers of the districts
which have not yet reported will be heard
from and a number of interesting papers
will be read. The members will devote the
evening to. social calls. ' . ' .
"Miss Mabel Clare Craft of Oakland-fol
lowed with- a dissertation upon the com
munity property law, and urged its
prompt amendment. Mrs. Lou V. Chapin
of Los -Angeles closed the discussion.
The basis of the law regarding the property
of women has the basis of the English com
mon law, down to the time of the revolution.
It since has been expanded and Improved, but
it still contains the crude, harsh laws of the
old Anglo-Saxon. They based their tenure on
the military service of the holder, and It passed
away with his life. Then inheritance came In,
and finally woman was allowed to become an
heir. From this came, by slow Â¦ degrees, the
laws which are. to-day, upon our statute books.
Mrs. * Martha Strickland Clark opened
the evening discussion on "Property
Rights of Women," saying in part:
Every in the hall was filled last
night when the president called the con
vention to order. - Many of the ladies were
in evening dress, and others took the ad
vice of Mrs. Burdette and brought their
husbands with- them, that they might be
come better acquainted with the mys
teries of the club life of women.
Mrs. Camille d'Arville-Crellln, who was
announced to sing, sent her regrets at
being unable to be present on account ot
her physician's orders.

There is yet much to condemn in modern
Journalism. Does the press create public sen

depraved taste of those who want that class

equally responsible for its existence.
Mrs. Burdette announced the following
appointments:
The newspaper as it comes to you in the
morning, and is read, thrown aside, made to
do duty on a pantry shelf, to light the fire or
polish the stove, is a commonplace thing. But
take It as it really is â the most titanic forces
are used in its production, and it becomes a
marvel of Influence and force in molding public
opinion. The greatest scientists, doctors,
lawyers and statesmen contribute to its col
umns. By means of the telegraph the club wo
men of the United States from Maine to Cali

pedia of the present. The newspaper la the lit

the newspaper so is he."
Mrs. Florence Collins Porter of Los An
geles read a paper on the "Influence of
the Press on Education." - Mrs. Porter
was formerly president of the Maine Fed
eration. She said in part:
The woman ..who works will be. the ruler of
her own fate. . We clubwomen know. them In
every scale, from the silly shopgirl up to the
department head. Their wide experience, their
small wages, their troubles with overtime and
petty exactions make them almost working ma
chines. They need to go out into the world and
see things, as they are. The wife of the work
ingman is the backbone and sinew of the land.
Knowledge . and sympathy are the two great
factors to overcome the tribulations of the
working classes.'
"Extension of Clubs Among Working
Women" was the title of a paper read
by Dr. Dorothea Moore. Working women
were divided by the speaker into two
classesâ the woman who works for a liv
ing a:Â«3 the womao whose husband is. a
working man. She said- in part:

J. Batchelder presided at the piano. .
Mrs. F. E. Prior of Los Angeles read
the report of the committee on club ex
tension. She read the figures of increase
in clubs and membership, and urged upon
all club members the advisability of re
ciprocity meetings in all districts, where
the larger clubs should invite the smaller
clubs to unite with them in. discussion of
club topics. {
What Clubs Can Do.
I would like to susffest to the individual clubs
of cities and towns where there-, is more than
one organization that "courtesy days" bfi es
tablished, where one club invites all the mem
bers of the other clubs to be its euests and
to take part In the programme for that day.
With the more Intimate knowledge of each
other's work and workers, there will result less
unjust criticism, less friction in the club life
of the community and a sincere and helpful
belief in each other's motives and methods. '
As California Is one of the largest States in
the federation, so must her women be largest

When it was first proposed that the Census Bureau
be made a permanent part of the Government a bill
was devised for that purpose which ..would have Es
tablished the bureau with the least possible expense
and placed its clerks under the merit system. To that
proposal Congress showed itself, adverse from the
The story of the measure discloses an immense job.
It will be remembered that when preparations were
under way for taking the census efforts were made to
have all appointments subject to the merit system,
as the experience of the past had proven that ap
pointments made as a part of the spoils system of
politics invariably Handicapped the bureau in its work
and led to serious, defects in the results. All such
efforts were futile. Congress made use of the cen
sus service as a means of helping its pets, and ac
cordingly a very large proportion of the employes
of the bureau are nothing more nor less than political
tax-eaters.
CONGRESS may have its faults, but if reports
from Washington be true it cannot be rightly
charged with any feeling of callous indiffer
ence toward the claims which pets have upon the
human heart. It appears that the new bill for estab
lishing a permanent census bureau differs from the
original bill mainly in that it provides for what a
Massachusetts Representative called "keeping, our
pets in office," and the vigor with which it has been
supported shows that the. change has won for it the
support of many a Congressman who otherwise
would not even have taken the trouble to read it.
CARING FOR PETS.
If Schwab, the steel magnate, has shocked our

The Alcazar edition of '-'The Danites"
is going very ' well this week. It is by
much the strongest of. the Western plays
that have been produced and the Alcazar
company is giving a very pleasing ren
dering of its powerful story. M. LL Alsop
has the part of Sandy McGee and nils all
requirements' as the typical miner of the
days gone by. George Osbourne as tbV
parson and Frank | Bacon as the Judge
are particularly well suited in their parts,
and Marion Convere as the heroine, Nancy
Williams, and ; Margaret. Wycherley as
Hulda Brown are both attractive. The
"Rogue's Comedy" is billed for next week.
The Grand Opera-house has a very good
bill this week with the favorite play, "Jim
the Penman," as the - programme. Ed
ward Ard'en, who is now in the third week
of his starring engagement at the Mis
sion-street house, has the role of the
clever detective who finally "lands" the
ingenious thief known to the police as
"Jim the Penman." The role suits Mr.
Arden excellently and he is well sup
ported by the stock company of the house.
Herschel Mayall does good work as the
famous forger, Laura Nelson Hall as his
wife is seen to advantage and Lillian Al
bertson shows much promise, in the role
of Agnes. Gardner Crane is another
player who does much for the play. "Rag
lan's Way" comes next, another play from
the pen of Mr. Arden. ' ' ".
â¢ Â¦ Â¦ >' â¢.Â¦'Â¦''.?
The play is Â¦ admirably staged and the
drama is highly enjoyable from end to
end. Next -week the California will have
another excellent attraction, the' Froh
man production of "Tne Sign of the
Cross," with Charles Dalton in his
original part.
The romantic drama Is also in evidence
at the California Theater, where a very
enjoyable and picturesque presentation of
"The. Pride of Jennico" is being given.
The production is the one in which James
K. Hackett won so much favor. Wallace
Worsley, who was with the Empire Stock
Company last season, assumes the hero's
part and seems to have his metier in the
romantic drama. Miss Frances Neilson
as the Princess of Dornhelm shares honors
with Mr. Worsley and the rest of the
cast is made up of clever people.
ONE of the most successful produc
tions of recent theatrical seasons
is the current play at the Colum
bia Theater, "In the Palace of
' the King." with Miss Viola Allen
and her," company at the helm. The play
itself is of sterling interest, the story stir
ring and picturesque and told with clear
ness and speed. The players rank with
the best of the theatrical organizations
that are to be seen and the' settings are
of the utmost splendor. Miss Allen re
turns to us with a broader genius and
stronger spell and as the charming Do
lores de Mondoza has the best part in
many respects that she has been seen in
here. William Pascpe as the hero, Don
John, makes a very pleasing impression,
and W. E. Bonriey, as the King of Spain,
gives an exceptionally strong picture of
the despicable monarch. Arthur Hoyt is
a clever court fool and the rest of the
cast is in competent hands. The crowds
are handled cleverly and the production Is
one in all respects that should be seen.
The issue is one that should be acted upon
promptly. The St. Louis exposition is going to af
ford an extraordinary opportunity for making known
the advantages which California offers to settlers and
to capitalists, as well as revealing the wealth of
products we have to offer to trade and commerce.
The time for preparing for the exhibit is but short.
San Francisco, therefore, should act at once. She will
be the chief beneficiary of the exhibit andi should be
the chief contributor toward the cost of preparing it
and maintaining it.
No argument is needed to sustain the fact that this
city is the reservoir of the wealth of the State, and
that the business prosperity of the city is dependent
upon the prosperity of the State at large. Anything
that tends to populate the State or develop the re
sburces and industries of the interior will 'tend to
build up and make prosperous the city itself.
Los Angeles will probably undertake to bear the
brunt of the Southern California exhibit at- St. Louis,
and San Francisco, with an equal consistency, should
undertake to assure a proper and adequate represen
tation of the Â»resour*ces of the entire State. The
amount of money to establish such a useful and
helpful leadership for the city would not be a heavy
burden upon the community. Were something like
$2000 a month contributed to the State Board of
Trade for the advancement of the welfare qf the State
the tax upon San Francisco would be slight, while
it would so increase the efficiency of the board as to
enable it to accomplish many things toward turning
the tide of. migration to California.
From the example of .Los Angeles we can learn
much to our advantage if we make a proper use of
the lesson. San Francisco is to California what Los
Angeles is to the south. As the metropolis of the
coast it will receive corresponding benefits from the
increased settlement and increased development of
the country which it feeds. In fact, there is no surer
way of building up San Francisco than by first build
ing up the interior. The more people there are in
the State the larger will be the amount of trade and
traffic our merchants will have to handle and our
bankers to finance. Such being the case, the busi
ness men and the property-holders of the city should
rouse themselves at this juncture and do all in their
power to promote the efforts already undertaken by
the people of the interior.
It is well known that the success of the counties of
Southern California has been largely due to the in
itiative and the leadership of Los Angeles. The peo
ple of that city have recognized the fact that what
ever advanced the welfare of any one of the south
ern counties was a distinct benefit to Los Angeles,
and according!}- they have been ever willing not only
to aid and back up the work of the counties, but to
undertake of their owr. motion many enterprises cal
culated to advertise the counties and to attract to
them capital and immigration.
The chief object of such efforts at present is that
of making a suitable exhibit of the counties and of
the State at the St. Louis exposition. In that work
no portion o* the State has a larger interest than San
Francisco, and the progressive men of the city ought
therefore to cordially co-operate in promoting it.
ACCORDING to the reports that come to us
the irterior counties of the State are just
now manifesting more interest in efforts to
advertise their resources and attract immigration than
ever before in their history. The work is being un
dertaken not with the brass band methods of the old
boom days, but with an earnestness that promises
permanently good results.
A DUTY OF SAN FRANCISCO.
The endowment is $10,000,000 in 5 per cent bonds,
yielding $500,000 annually.' The purpose was tersely
stated by Mr. Carnegie in his, brief and impressive
speech at the first meeting of the trustees. ' He said:
"Gentlemen, your work begins; your aims are high;
you seek to extend known forces and to discover and
utilize new forces for the benefit of man." When
Ptolemy Soter, the half-brother of Alexander the
Great, .founded the Alexandrian Library and its
academy, he, moved upon by the -spirit of Aristotle,
his teacher, made the same declaration' of purpose.

plished their purpose and passed between the. two
events, and yet the field is not exhausted nor have
the needs of man for its tillage been satisfied. The
spirit is uplifted mightily in the contemplation of this
latest preparation for continuing a work that began
when ir.en lived who had listened to Plato.
As understood on his own declarations this super
structure is begun by Mr. Andrew Carnegie in the
institution which is to bear his name. Its trustees
are made by the trust deed a self-perpetuating cor
poration, of which the President of the United States,
President of the Senate and Speaker of the House,
secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and presi
dent of the National Academy of Sciences are made
ex-officio members. v
Not only in these lines but in the whole vast field
of biology, of mechanics,- of dynamics, modern life
and its needs call for a training that shall be the
superstructure built on what foundation the univer
sities supply.
Not even in the formal reports of these departments
does one get an adequate conception of what this
work is. Scientific agriculture requires certain
highly specialized work. The subject of vegetable
physiology alone, which concerns the best results
from existing â¢ cultivation and the. addition of
useful crops, to diversify the cultivation of the
future, requires the work of many more ex
perts than are now available in the United
States. Concurrent , is vegetable pathology,
which has in it the control of v knowledge of
plant disease, a subject of the vastest importance to
agriculture and horticulture. Tracing the diseases
that waste plant life and cause failure of profit to the
planter is so requisite that it is not second in impor
tance to the medical profession which combats disease
in man. Entomology has progressed further 'than
either of the foregoing specialties. It deals with
animate, they. with inanimate, life.
THE Smithsonian Institution at Washington, was
founded' by an Englishman and RUt under na
tional, control." It was intended to be an -im
pulse to material development,: to spread among the
people a knowledge of the potential wealth of their
country and to bring to its development the work of
experts. Its foundation preceded the creation of the
scientific bureaus of the Cabinet departments, and
much of its field is now covered t>y them. But these
bureaus are handicapped by the need of trained men.
Neither in the Smithsonian nor in the universities of
the country do the existing facilities furnish enough
high experts to carry on the scientific work required
of the bureaus in the Interior and Agricultural de
partments.
CARNEGIE INSTITUTION.
Ex-Secretary Gage denies ."that he intends to re
tire from business activities to "private 'life. "-In a re
cent interview he said: "Men who have been busy
all their lives don't know what to do with "themselves
when the regular demands' qf business life are with
drawn. An old friend of. mine who tried retiring told
me he had never found anything so difficult. I shall Â»
keep in the traces."- All of that sounds well, but it is*
none the less a vanity. ' Every man should learn how
to do something besides work./ If Gage can do no
better he would find it profitable" to imitate Cleve
land and go duck-shooting occasionally.

Considered honestly and fairly from any point of
view racetrack gambling is abominable and de
testable. It is a poor plea at best to argue for money
against morals; to say that it matters not how many
embezzlements take place so long as the cigar trade
is good, how many forgeries are committed so long
as there is a flush gang to buy beer, how many de
falcations occur so long as the saloons flourish; that
we should look with indifference upon victims of
track gambling brought to ruin and to suicide so
long as the track gamblers are liberal with their
money in the tenderloin. Poor as- it is, however,
even thafr base plea cannot be made effectively.- The
track gambler is a kind of horse leech . that sucks
money out of a community 'as well as blood. If there
were no question of morals at stake, the gambling
scheme should be defeated in the interests of honest
industry and legitimate trade.
Then there is the other recent case of a soldier re
turning from the Philippines, who was induced to
gamble away at the racetrack the money he had
saved during his service, and who as a last resort at
tempted to make his way home in a dry goods box
in a freightcar. That is an example of what track
gambling leads to when the unwary try to beat, the
game.
It is to be borne in mind, moreover, that track
gamblers draw around them men who are a corrupt
ing force to the community. The scandal arising
from the brief career of "Plunger" Lewis is a case in
point and of current interest. Lewis undertook to
make bets to a large amount by giving a check upon
a bank in which he had no money. His defense was
that a job had been put up to defraud him,. and he
was playing to get even. That is the kind of men
track gambling brings to town.
It is a poor business, then, for any community to
support a racetrack even if the issue be considered
from the single standpoint of pecuniary profit.
That of course was but one item of the revenues
ot the association. They received money from every
one who entered the racetrack grounds. They ex
acted tribute from the boys who placed the bets of
gambling women in the grand stand. In short, they
were not in San Francisco for health, nor for the
purpose of promoting our industries. They were
here to obtain every dollar they could induce the
people to gamble away, and they were indifferent
whether it were procured by their victims through
honest means or through theft, embezzlement, for
gery and betrayal of trust. That is the way racetrack
gambling affects trade.
When the first fight was being made against Ingle
side racetrack gambling The Call had occasion to
compile statistics showing the extent of the financial
drain which -track gambling puts upon the city. The
management of the racetrack put forth a statement
in 1899 .showing that in four years Ingleside race
track had paid out $1,736,176. The claim was- that
they had put that amount of money into circulation,
while as a matter of fact it was first taken from the
city along with many another dollar. In the previous
year a dividend of 100 per cent had been paid to the
stockholders. The Call then showed that under that
management the bookmen paid to the association for
license to ply their trade at the track $20 for every
race. There were on an average six races a day, and
the season lasted 100 days. As there were an aver
age of eighteen bookmakers operating daily under
that system, a simple calculation shows that during
the four years of its management of the Ingleside
track that association had received from bookmakers
alone upward of $864,000, all of which was taken from
the legitimate. business of the city.
That credit cannot be permitted them. The course
they advocate would injure San Francisco materially
as well as morally. The track gamblers who \yould
flock to San Francisco upon the reopening of Ingle
side racetrack would not come to bring money, but
to take it away. They would come for the purpose
of enticing men and boys and even women to squan
der at the racetrack the money that should be used
thriftily in legitimate channels of trade. The gam
blers would draw into their own pockets many thou
sands of dollars that.of right should go to the grocery
men, clothiers, home builders, 'furniture makers,
book dealers and savings banks.. Money earned by
honest industry that ought to remain for the use of
such industry would be taken by the gamblers and
either used for the promotion of profligacy here or
carried East for profligacy there.
W.HEN those who are advocating the adop
tion of an ordinance permitting racetrack
gambling at Ingleside advance the argu
ment that such a course would lead to an improve
ment of business in the city and put money into the
channels of trade they doubtless believe,, they are
scoring a good points against the advocates of moral
ity. They pose as practical men in opposition to sen
timentalists, and demand the 'credit due to those who
have the material welfare of- the community at heart.
* BUSINESS AND MORALS.
to be one of the best measures ever, devised,
taking care of Congressional pets, and the taxpayers
who protest against it will have to admit at least that
Congress has a kindly heart.
many interesting peculiarities. Civil* Service 'Com
missioners Foulke and Proctor state that under its
provisions not only will all present employes of the
bureau be placed in the classified , service,*, but every
census clerk who has been employed and dropped
within the last year will be entitled to reinstatement,
and furthermore, as Mr. Foulke puts it, "a man who
had been employed in punching .cards in the Census
Bureau could be transferred to one of the depart
ments as a translator of Spanish."
Taking all things into consideration the bill seems
start._ Then the scheme was devised to establish: a
permanent Census Bureau, but to â¢ provide that the
present employes should all be retained as a part
of it. The scheme, will -mean the transfer of. upward
of 2700' clerks to the classified service and give them
a permanent job under the Government; or, as it
has been- stated by an opponent of the scheme, "it
means that 2700 appointments shall be taken out of
the reach of citizens content to submit themselves to
competition and given to those who entered the ser
vice through the preferences of Congressmen."^
The bill, in, fact, seems to be marked by a good

THE French bark Alice reached
port yesterday from Algoa Bay
and was at once placed in quar

and received a thorough fumigation.
Black plague is raging at Algoa Bay and
the local quarantine officials propose to
take no chances of admitting the disease
to this country. The ballast in the hold of
the Alice was obtained in the infected
region. In spite of the fact; that the ves
sel has been away from Algoa Bay 129
days this ballast is still considered too
dangerous a commodity for anywhere but
the antiseptic stronghold of Davy Jones.
It will be thrown overboard to-day. Vic

The Hay Situation.
The private circular of Somers & Co. says*
tinder date of Tebruary 4 :
â¢â¢Shipments of Hay have continued light
throughout the past week, the total being very
close to that of the week preceding, 2100 tona.
The situation has been somewhat peculiar for
a week or ten days past, the market having
been extremely sensitive to weather Influences.
On Friday last, owing to no sign of rain, the
market advanced about 30c per ton. On Satur
day figain it seemed to soften a bit with the
anticipation of rain Sunday. The slight pre
cipitation of Saturday night did some good,
but must be followed by more shortly to ln-
Fure a crop. As we write it is cloudy, but ,
the thermometer hardly indicates rain.
'Â¦Although the market seems purely a
r.-eather market, yet at the present time it
Fliould not be controlled entirely by this idea.
Rain or no rain there is no reason why Hay
Fhould not hold strongly at the present prices
or even higher. Stocks are being rapidly re
duced in the country and many heretofore
hay sections are now buying very largely in
ether districts fcr their own use. With this
unusual and unexpected demand' there may be
tome question as to whether we will have
enough to last ub through the year; such a
condition should surely hold uj) prices for the
belance of the season.
â¢Although some few cars of fancy wheat hay
have so'.d at high as $14, yet this can hardly
be given as an actual quotation."
The Feeling in Wall Street.
CLEWS STATES IT AS BUOYANT
AND RATHER BULLISH THAN
OTHERWISE.
The JCew York circular of Henry Clews says:
"An Improved change can be observed In
Stock Exchange temper, as there Is a some- :
*-hat more confident feeling prevailing, but
opinion regarding the future of the market con
tinues much divided. Among a large number
of threwd, successful men, there Is a feeling
that the time is ripe for conservatism, that the
wave of prosperity has reached its crest, and
car. make little further progress unless some
degree of recession takes place to permit an
other start. On the ether hand there Is still
a large lecogniticn of the fact that while the
country has been making phenomenal progress.,
breaking i'.ll Conner standards, the business
â¢ituciK.il is still sound, and that as yet there it
no appearance uf overstrained credit or seri
ous reaction.
"One amazing feature is the slight effect the
Ices cf the corn crop is having upon either
railroad traffic or general business. The re
ceipts of grain at Chicago during four weeks
in January were only 11,000,000 bushels,
against over 22,<JO0,000 bushels the same week
last year, a loss of 50 per cent in this class
of ; traffic, due chiefly to reduction in the corn
movement. It was expected that January
would be the period when this deficiency began
to be felt, but the most enthusiastic optimist
scarcely l;ad the courage to predict that it
wouia make no difference to the grand result
in earnings. Such a loss in traTflc a few
years ago would have put some roads into
bankruptcy; while, now, the roads affected are
actually showing gains over the large returns
of a year ago. -This simply goes to prove the
gTfat activity in general business. The farm
ert r.f the West have enjoyed a series of pros
perous years; high prices for corn and cats-,
together with" a good yield of wheat. ' have
largely compensated them for the shortage In
com: the tow:is and cities of the West are also
etill in the midst of the boom, and the re
tulting immense demands fcr both raw ma
terials and manufactured products keep the
railroads taxed to their full capacity; while
experienced judges on the ground are of opin
ion that the prosperity wave has not yet spent
Its full force in the West, though it may have
Marty done so in the East.
"It is such facts as these that enable the
big holders of ttccks to maintain a firm front
where the average trader and Investor thinks
it prudent to. keep aloof. Certainly the situ
ation Just now renders operations on the short
side <iAtia-hazardous. The market refuses to
go J'.wn because the financial powers with
abundance of eat-y money and good earnings,
behind them have it in their power to severely
punish those v.-ho seriously antagonize them,
inertia is the least acceptable condition to the
jTCfessional element, which if it cannot de
press is equally ready to elevate prices. A
Kimewliat brighter feeling has beÂ«n noticed the
last few rtayi. due to rising bank reserves and
to a loiter situation abroad, resulting from
I eect proFi^ectE in South Africa and a favor
t tile reaction- in the Gterman Industrial sltua
t on. There is also a good investment demand
i n- bonds, which has tempted the bringing out
Â« f several new important issue*. This fact has
1 ?er. anticipated in these advices and demon
Â»irates an undTtcne of confidence on the part
Â« ( bankers financing these deals, who will be
! fceljr to give the market general support until
1 jch orTerings are absorbed. - The excellent
1 hewing of the United States Steel Corporation
mi the advance Jn copper." resulting from
;ir?re demand for the eame. were also stimulat
ing factoris. and the proposed reduction of tax
ation by abolishing the war taxes should have
a favorable effect, because the stoppage of ab
t^rption cf fund3 by the treasury will remove
â¢ â¢ne of the most serious menaces to the mone
tary Eitu&tlcn. . .
"The immediate outlook of the market- is
<her*fore mere favorable, and it would not be
i -lrprltirig if considerable efforts were made to
:tlrrulate greater activity. Good. opportunities
lr trading are offered in the present situation
1 <-t we continue to advise th- taking of mod
crate profits when such are offered."

NEW YORK. Feb. 5.â To-day's stock market
was a dull affair, in spite of spasmodic efforts
by pools to awaken a general movement in the
market. By the time they succeeded in moving
prices one point depression would develop in
another, and in consequence the dull movement
was irregular all dayf Striking movements in
closely held high-priced stocks continued a fea
ture. The significance of these movements was
not disclosed, although traders sought .to make
the most of them for their sympathetic effect
on the general list. These apparently sensa
tional movements on a very small volume of
trading are a natural consequence where the
stock of a company is closely held for pur
poses of control or centralized In the hands of 1
a few powerful capitalists for investment, who
are quite uninfluenced by the course . of prices
in the open market. . Among the stocks so mov
ing were the Chicago and Northwesterns, Amer
ican Express. United States Express and Lack
awanna. Nashville, Chattanooga and St.
Louis, which advanced 10% yesterday, reacted
3% to-day. The recent sensational upward
movement in Lackawanna is associated with
the rumors of control of that road in the inter
est of an outlet for the Wabash system. The
Wabash stocks were very firm to-day in the
same connection. Another center of specula
tion was in the local traction stocks under the
influence of published reports from Philadelphia
of information of a securities company to hold
â¢Metropolitan Street Railway stock and possibly
other local traction stocks. Manhattan was "the
moat active of this group, and Metropolitan
Street Railway, after an upward spurt ( lÂ«
declined 00 profit-taking, falling 1% below last
night during the day and pulling the other
local tractions with iti The speculation In
Amalgamated Copper was very feverish, the
price running off 1% during the morning on the
further break in London copper markets and
the slump in Rio Tintos. The steadying
of the London copper market and re
ports of a panic among the bears In Rio
Tintos rallied Amalgamated Copper to 1% over
las<. night, and it was an effective factor in the
late rally In the New York stock market. The
speculative pool operating in Southern Pacific
took that stock vigorously in hand and pushed
it up 1% on very large bidding. The general
market rallied in sympathy. St. Paul rose 2
points over last night and a number of other
transcontinentals about a point. Steel also de
veloped some strength at the close. Minneapolis
St. Paul and Sault Ste. â¢ Marie preferred added
4% more pints to Its upward course. ,The re
cent buying of Sugar continued; but its net
gain was only a fraction. There was no general
Influence effective in the market at any time
beyond the disposition to dullness caused by thÂ«
export movement of gold and the unsettled
question of the Northern Securities Company
The bond market was only moderately active

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Feb. 5.â Wheat lay almost life
less, to-day â the dullest market it has ex
perienced ' for a long time. ' Routine news was
Indifferent and on ' the whole the pit lacked
any feature to redeem it from lethargy. The
early fluctuations were almost imperceptible,
though under the influence of corn. May at
one time got %c under yesterday's close. There
was almost no speculation Cables were slight
ly lower, but improved with the day. There
was some selling; orders and the local crowd
sold at every opportunity though not to any
great extent. The usual statistics were slight
ly bullish, but helped little May opened %@
%c lower at'78Â©77%c and sold up -to 78VgC
On the corn break May slowly declined to 77%c,
but reacted on covering. ' the small reaction In
corn and the improving cables. May closed
a trifle weaker.. %@%c lower, at 77%c.\
Corn, while not so dull as wheat, was a
weak and quiet market. Sentiment was gen
erally bearish, regardless of bullish news from
the country. May corn closed Â¦ barely weak,
%Â©%c lower, at 63%c.'
. Oats were profoundly dull and featureless.
May closed %@%c lower at 44c.
After a fairly Â¦ strong and higher opening
provisions sold off with the grain slump. May
pork closed Cc lower; lard a shade lower and
ribs unchanged: , â¢ . .

WHEATâ All markets, ' both in this country

but little change In prices.
Chicago was tame, the market being a scalp-

flour trade was reported so dull that the Min
neapolis mills would â¢ mostly shut down, and
the few left running; would grind Manitoba
wheat In bond, though the report lacked con
firmation. Toward the close of the session thero
was heavy selling, one house selling a mil
lion bushels.
In this market futures were lower, but spot
prices stood as before.

o'clock this morning. Sheriff John H.

o clock by a terrific explosion in the bank,
beizlng a pistol in each hand he rushed
to the bank. The robbers, who numbered
live or six, were evidently prepared for
him, as they opened fife the moment n*
appeared. The officer was wounded at
the first volley, but he stood his ground
and returned the fire, sending naif -a
dozen bullets at the robbers. The wound
ed Sheriff managed to get back to htÂ«
room, where he died within twenty min
utes. When hastily aroused citizens be
gan arriving at the scene Sheriff Powers*
was dead and the robbers* had vanished.
T he interior of the bank presented a,
wrecked appearance, the men having used

UNKNOWN MAN KILLED
AT RAILROAD CROSSINQ
Mission Street, Near Twen
ty-Fourth.
Struck by Southern Pacific Train on
An unknown man was struck and killed
last night by a Southern Pacific train,
at the railroad crossing on -Mission street
near Twenty-fourth. The deceased was
about 60 years of age and weighed about
160 pounds, la five feet six inches in height
and, had on a dark brown suit. In a
pocket of the coat was found a note writ
ten in French and German. Translated
it reads as follows:
You are quite right, my child. They go to
Berlin. You lie. Never to see you again.
Farewell, farewell, - old house. Farewell, go to
The word "staids" appears at the end
of the scrawl and this may be the name
of the man.
Mrs. William Burke, who lives at 2S17
Mission street, directly opposite the cross
ing, states that she was looking out of
her window between 8 and 9 o'clock and
saw the gateman lower the gates and
then raise them again to let a man pass.
The gateman denies this statement by
asserting he did not see the man until
he found him lying dead by the track.

ESCAPE FROM STOCKADE
Ten: Men Tunnel Their Way to Free-
dom and Police Capture
Three of Them.
Ten military prisoners confined in a
stockade at the Presidio tunneled their
way to freedom last Tuesday night. Their
escape from custody was as bold as
it was skillful. There were forty prison
ers in the stockade for trivial offenses
committed at the post, smc\ as the place
was overcrowded the soldiers plotted to
get away.- A tunnel was dugr and at the
proper time ten of the prisoners took
French leave. The men disappeared be
fore the sentry on duty discovered tha
tunnel. Another man who was trying to
escape was brought to a standstill by a
shot from a rifle. Colonel Rawles ia
making an Investigation.
Last night Officers Steve Bonner and
Alfred Holmes arrested George Clark andt
two other soldiers, who are believed to
be escapes.
CUSTOM HOUSE PROMOTION.â J. E. Mul
tlen, a customs inspector, has been promoted
to the vacancy caused by the advancement ot
D. J. O'Leary. . Â¦
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway, Feb. 3.
Out of the move of Health Officer Kd
ward von Adelung to establish regular
medical inspection of the pupils in the
public schools has developed a three-cor
nered fight, in which the Health Officer,
Â¦ the Board of Health and the Board of
Udueation are involved.
Dr. von Adelung proposes to go ahead;.
President Hamlin of the Board of Health
says that if his board has the power the
examination will be stopped; the School
Board is divided over the propriety of its
action In giving Dr. von Adelung permis
sion to put his pet project into operation
against the wishes of the Board of
Health, of which he is the executive offi
cer.
Expressions collected from parents of
public school pupils indicate that they
will in no uncertain manner express their
disapproval of any medical examination
of their children without their consent
and by other than their family physi
cians.
The matter of a proposed inspection of
public school pupils with a view toward
detecting cases of contagious diseases was
broached by Dr. von Adelung at a meet
ing of the Board of Health about a month
ago, but was opposed by the members cf
the board and laid on the table. â¢
The HerAh Officer then proceeded inde
pendently Tit the board to organize a
corps of inspectors and obtained perm's
sion from the School Board to put the
scheme into practice.
Dr. von Adelung defends his position In
the matter as that of a patriotic citizen
laboring for the physical well being of
the school children. He said:
This plan is not launched by me 'in my ca
pacity as Health Officer, or Is it my own
scheme, but a system in successful operation
In many cities elsewhere. I am going ahead
with it as an experiment here and have the
sanction of the School Board. If the system
is not a. success it will be the duty of that
1 body to put a stop to it. When the plan
i demonstrates its worth I. shall expect the
Board of Health to take hold of it and make
it permanent.
Dr. Hamlin said:
I do not know at present just what is the
province of the Board of Health In the prem
ises, but I shall find out as soon as possible,
and if we have jurisdiction this medical ex
amination will be stopped. . The parents of the
children will hold us responsible, anyway.
The plea is made that the inspection is for
the purpose of checking the spread of infec
tious diseases, but In practically every instance
these cases are In charge of the regular family
physician before the disease reaches the con
tagious stage. I regard the use of the inspec
tion system as unnecessary and irregular.
School Director F. C. Clift said:
I think the Board of Education made a seri
ous mistake In giving Dr. von Adelung per
mission to Install a corps of medical Inspec
tors in the schools. The members of the
School Board knew that the advisability of the
scheme was in controversy between the Health
Officer and the Board of Health, and it seems
to me that it was discourteous for one of the
city'e governing bodies to take . sides against
another in a contest with Its executive officer.
We should have dealt with the other boarJ
direct.
Furthermore, leaving the standing of thÂ»
corps of inspectors out of the question, I am
eure that the children's parents will object to
an enforced medical inspection. I am already
in receipt of many protests against eucji treat- '
rrsent. . . - " . j
I know I should feel that way. It seems to I
me that the Health Officer's course has been
Irregular and unprofessional. '
The advisability of a special meetlrtg '
of the Board of Health for next Friday i
evening for the purpose of investigating i
Dr. von Adelung's scheme and deciding i
upon a course of action with regard to It :
is being discussed. ,
Replying to other questions. Governor
Taft stated that in the islands there are
about 5.000.000 acres of land held by pri
vate persons, and that of this 403.000 acres
are owned by the Catholic mars. Of
these 403,000 acres 230,000 aite the best lands
in the islands. The committee will meit
to-morrow. ;
In reply to a question Governor Taft
said there are thirty-four organized and
fifteen unorganized provinces. In answer
to a ciuestion by Senator Patterson Gov
ernor Taft said it was not true that a
majority of the people can read and
write. As to the position of women in the
islands, he said that the women of the
Philippines hold a superior position. They
are the active managers in general af
fairs and the Spanish Archbishop had
said to him that if it was intended to con
fer any political authority upon the Fili
pinos it should be conferred upon the
female sex. . . '
â¢General Chaffee and I are on the
friendliest and most cordial terms," Taft
saia, "and we had no difficulty in reach
ing an understanding -after a prolonged
conference. Our compromise was reached
on the understanding that a writ of
habeas corpus would not lie against mili
tary officers, a civilian employe of the
military branch or a.prisoner of war."
Governor Taft also said that there had
been some difference of opinion as to
other matters in the method of adminis
tration Â«nd that naturally the natives
were more favorably inclined toward the
civil government because they were rep
resented by men of their own nationality
in that branch of the service, while on
the other hand the army was principally
concerned in bringing the war to an end.
He thought, however, the military au
thorities were coming to look with more
favor on the civil institutions.
In this connection Governor Taft ex
plained at some length the contention be
tween the commission and General Chaf
fee which had, he said, arisen over tne
habeas corpus provision m 'the commis
sion's code. That provision had been in
serted, he said, to protect native officers
who surrendered and .who are subject to
ariest on charges of crime committed
while in the insurrection service believed
to be contrary to the rules of civilized
warfare. Such charges against these men
wer.e common and often they were un
founded. . . .': '
The day's session began with the under
standing that there should be no interrup
tion by me memoers of the- committee
until me presentation of this entire
branch of me suDject -was completed.
Uovernor 'â¢ Tail saiu that originally the
military and civil control of die islands
nau Dten m the hanus of . the military
anu mat naturally mere nad been some
umerencc ot opinion Detween the military
autnormes anu the commission as to tne
metnod of proceeding. Tnis Â¦ difference;
naa arisen wttn ueneral MacArtnur, anu
tnure nau been more or less eorrespcuci
ence on the subject. The general had
concenued mat. authority, over the islands
was vested in the military and the repre
sentative of the chiet executive because
iiie islands were in a state of war. In
this view.ihe commission did not concur,
'mis cniierence did not, however, extend
to tne control of the municipalities.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 5.â In his state
ment before the Senate Committee on the
Phnlppines Governor Taft to-day dwelt
especially upon the relationship of .the
military and civil authorities in the Phil
ippines. Among other things he said that
women should have the cnief privileges
because of their intelligence. .

Newlands, in explanation of his resolu
tion, said: . ~
The resolution confines the 25 per cent
reduction of duties to the period prior to
January 1, 1903. > The provision as to an
nexation fig as follows:
WASHINGTON, Feb. ' 5.â Representative
Newlands. of Nevada, of the Ways and
Means Committee, who was the author
of the resolution annexing Hawaii, to-dny
introduced a joint resolution inviting the
republic of Cuba to become a part of the
United States flrst as a Territory and
then as a State of the Union, to be called
the State of; Cuba, and also authorizing
a 25 per cent reduction of duty in the
present crop of Cuban sugar, in considera
lionof Cuba granting preferential rates

Now Mrs. Mansfield, who is devoutft
religious, has separated from her husband
and asked for an annulment of her mar
riage, though she holds nothing against
him.
While in California Mr. Mansfield, who
had entered the employ of the railroad
company, heard that his wife had died.
The news came to him after he had been
here five or sir years. He did not think
of marrying- again until 18S7, when he met
Miss McMillan and they became husband
and wife.
The discovery that the husbands lin*t
wife was living came about in a peculiar
way. lie and the second wife were liv
iiig happily together umil one day Mr.
Alanttitid uled an application for a pen
sion, basing his claim upon the fact that
he is a veteran of the Civil War. What
was his surprise to receive the informa
tion within a short time that his first
wile was already in receipt of a pension
on the ground that she was his widow!
The news astonished the old engineer.
He had always thought the first wife
dead, and the episode of the pension re
veals that she also thought him dead.
Mr. Mansfield's troubles, it seems, be
gan with the outbreak of the Civil War.
He was a prosperous business man in
Lowell, Mass., when the conscriptkm took
him away to battle for his country. He
fought in a number of battles. When be
returned at the close of the conflict he
found his business ruined, and to retrieve
his fortunes "he came to California.
After forty years William F. Mansfield,
aii engineer, formerly In the employ of
the Southern l'aciric Company, has dis
covered that the wife he thought dead all
ihis tirne is still among the living.
Tiiis romantic life episode is revealed
through the Illins of a suit to-day by
Mrs. Margaret Harriot Munsneld to annul
her marriage With the old engineer. Bhe
iiSM.ris ttiai she was married to him oa
vrebruiiry 17, 1Â«>7. by the Rev. -F. A. llor
Â¦jon, then pastor of the First Presbyterian
v iuirth, not knowing then that he had a
wile still living. She asks that the mar
riage L>e declared void and permission
given to her to resume her maiden narae r
of Margaret Harriet McMillan. There are
no Cii.-^ren.

GRAPE-NUTS.
MAKES CHILDREN BRAINY.
Propf About Feeding.
It has been proved times without num-
ber that properly selected food will build
jzp the brain. The testimony of a school
teacher on this subject is good. The let-
ter is long and only the important facts
will be given:
"While I was teaching school in 1SSS a
little girl in the household where I lived
vras very fond of Grape-N'uts and would
all she was allowed. I noticed that
f-he was a remarkably bright pupil. There
were five other children, all of one fam-
ily, that were bo marked in their work.
They were really the brightest family I
ever knew, so I questioned to find what
they were using. They replied, 'Only
Grape-Nuts.' I learned upon further in-
quiry that this was their chief diet for
breakfast and discovered that their
luncheon consisted generally of Grape-
Nuts with cream and a little fruit.
"1 had suffered from dyspepsia, head-
aches and general debility greatly and,
:is I knew, my diet was not well selected.
1 took up prape-N'uts Breakfast Food and
f-arried it to school for luncheon. I Boon
discovered a. change in my condition and
found that Grape-Xuts afforded more
nourishment than bread, meat, eggs or
anything that I could take in my basket.
After luncheon I would feel strong and
bright for the afternoon's work, while be-
fore,! had frequently been half 111.
"In the spring ot 1900 I went to college,
rented a room and boarded myself, sub-
Fisting largely oa Grape-N'uts, and I can-
not speak too highly of the food as a
Kraln nourisher. At thfe end of a year'a
schooling I obtained a position In one of
the ward schools in this a college town,
and am well end happy.
"The wife of the college principal tells
me that there is no food that agrees wild
l.cr as well as Grape-Nuts, and that tes-
timony was repeated by a lady friend ;n
lay own home." Name given by Postum

MACHINISTS AND HANDY MEN TO KNOW
THAT THE MACHINISTS' STRIKE IS
PRACTICALLY OVER.
ALL SHOPS RUNNING AS USUAL.
The machinists' slrika that has been on in the
principal Denver shops since October is now
practically broken, as the shops are running
with non-union men 'and only about 25 per cent
of the strikers remain In town, walking the
streets.
The victory claimed by the strikers at the
Colorado Iron Works Company Is In reality a
defeat. The men went out for a nine-hour day,
whereas this is the very point not conceded by
the Colorado Iron Works Company. A number
of the old men from the Colorado Iron Works
Company were selected by tha management and
offered Individually their old positions, If they
would work the hours per day stipulated by the
manufacturers, and conform to their shop
rules and regulations.
Mulberry, who is conducting the strike, op-
posed this and a stormy meeting followed, un-
til the men demanded that they be allowed to
return or v/ithdraw from the union. To make
the appearance of a victory and prevent a less
of more men, the union were obllsed to sanc-
tion the .rtturn cf these men. hence the mis-
leading report in the daily papers.
This Â«trikc his Â¦ demonstrated two things:
That the majority 'of first-class men are free
men p.nd will sot be bound by arbitrary unions,
and that the Denver Machinery Manufacturers
arc organized as a unit to resist the unjust,
unreasonable, unbusinesslike and arbitrary de-
mands of organized labor.

I knew Mrs. Hammond Moore very well while
I was stopping at the Repelier, but she : never
confided to me anything about, her relatives or
her past. On these subjects she was non-com
mittal. She spoke of a husband who was dead
and once told' me that she was married in Ken
tucky. She claimed to live in New Tork and
said that it was her first visit to the coast.
Mrs. Dr. Duncan, who now lives at
Hanford, but, who Hved for a time-at the
Repelier, was a close friend of the dead
woman. She was interviewed by., tele
phone last. night and said:
The body of Mrs. Moore will be bur'ed
to-day, but the inquest will not b# held
for several days. Coroner Clark of
Stockton hopes by. that time something
will develop that will lead to the identity
of the woman's relatives or friends. :
. Mr. Aust, who wrote to Chief Wittman
concerning Mrs. "Moore's Identity, stated
that she had traveled on the Newport
from New York to this coast by the isth
mian route. On arriving in this city Mrs.
Moore put up at the Occidental Hotel,
according to Aust, who was a fellow pas
senger of the unfortunate woman. After
leaving the Occidental Aust thinks Mrs.
Moore went to- the L'Aiglon, but investi
gation shows that she went to the Repel
ier instead. - ' . .
Mr. Sparrows positively identifies Mrs.
Moore's picture, which was taken at the
Stockton Morgue. He says. he has a-dis
tinct recollection of her face and that, he
cannot be .'mistaken. Captain Seymour
believes, that after leaving the city Mrs.
Moore was forced to sell the rich cloth
ing,- laces and sealskins that she had in
her trunk when, she left the Repelier on
December 11.- He believes that the val
uable sable coat which Mrs. Moore owned
will be found in some of the pawn shops
of this city or Sacramento. ~ Â¦
were only, worth $200. In a short time
this money was spent and Mrs.- Moore
was forced to make another call on the
jewelers and dispose of more of her valu
ables. This time" she sold a silver watch
for $5.'.' Mrs. Moore became, a bit confi
dential with Mr. Sparrows and informed
him that she hated to part with the jew
elry. "When it is all gone; 1 ' said Mrs.
Moore, "then I go."
Later the hard-pressed woman was
H forced to part with, an elegant, scarfpm,.
made In the shapeof a deer's, head with
a diamond pendant. This was allowed t<>
go the way of her other possessions as a
last resource. She told the jeweler, that
it belonged to her husband and it was the
emblem of a club of six wealthy men'.of
which" he was a member.

12 and 1 o'clock Tuesday afternoon anl
asked the price of a certain tea. He left
but returned in a few minutes and told
Marshall that a man outside on the side
walk wanted to talk to him.- Marshall
went outside and began talking . to tht
second man. The first man then sneaked
baclc into the store and "opened the. till,
but did not get any money.
The same men evidently, accompanied liy
another, called at Frank Glaser's butch-'
er shop, 203 Second street. One of. them
told Glaser there was something the mat
â¢ter with the harness on. his horse. Glaser
went out to look at the harness and .when
he ' returned found that" the cash . register
had been opened and $20 In gold stolen. ..

Under- an order issued yesterday by
Chief of Police Wittman, the cubic air
ordinance, which has. been a dead letter
on the statute books for a number, of
years will now be 'enforced. The ordi
nance requires that a human being must
not occupy sleeping apartments contain
ing less than 500 cubic feet of air. and
that that volume must be increased as
many times as there are persons in the
iThe" revival of the ordinance will cau.se
wholesale arrests. Shortly after its pas
sage several years i ago the jails were
crowded with prisoners and extra ac
commodations had to be secured. Nearly
1000 Chinese were taken into custody in
two days and many of them slept on the
roof of â¢ the County. Jail until they se
cured their release.
Chief Wittman discovered by a recent
investigation that the laws of health in
this respect have been flagrantly violated
and that niuch disease has been the re
sult. Jn the Latin quarter, south of Mar
ket street and particularly in the Chinese
quarter the officers have been instructed
to be active. Throughout the section of
cheap lodging-houses, where poor, lods
ers are. packed in regardless of space, the
condition is very unhealthful and the po
lice will give their particular attention to
these places.

The State Board of Pharmacy caused
several arrests last week, -among , those
arrested being I. Levin' of Levin Broth

Brothers, grocers, for violating the pro
visions of the statute recently enacted to
prevent the selling of poison unless* a reg

and she asked him to carry some of her
bundles home; that he accommodated her
and while in Hall's house was fixing a
leck; that the .husband came in, and
without giving him a chance to explain
his presence assaulted him. Shortly after
Berry left the hospital Bitter came in to
have his wounds redressed. He was ad
vised to place a charge against Hall.
Officer Dow, who is on duty in the vi

placed him under arrest.
Last night Hall found Berry j at "i!s

struck the latter over the head and in
flicted a number of wounds. Berry went
to a near by drug store to have his
wounds dressed and was advised to go
to the ' Emergency Hospital. He went
there and had four lacerations dressed.
Hall, who is of a jealous disposition, at
tacked both men on separate occasions
because they rendered services to his
wife. On Tuesday night Mrs. Hall vis

providing for the payment of these sal
aries set aside on the ground that they
were illegally passed. They also ask for

fund the salaries they have received for
the last two years. The plaintiffs also al
lege that a treasurer to control the

taken advantage of this fact to appro
priate large sums. The plaintiffs further
claim that a loan of ?3000 to the corpora

McCormick, was never made, but that a
note for that amount was made In her
favor In order that she might receive a
large sum as interest.

The Right Rev. Bishop "W. F. : Nichols,
D.D.. delivered the -last of the course of
lectures at St. Luke's Church, Van Ness
avenue and Clay street, last evening,
which have been given under the auspices
of the Sunday School Commission of, the
Diocese of California. Bishop Nichols
took for his subject "How to Teach Doc
trine" and proved In the course of pro
found and deeply thought out arguments
and demonstrations that the better meth
od to instruct the child in religion was to
reach its spiritual understanding and" In
stinct. The subject of teaching had been
treated in the course of the lectures. and
the main point which had been under con
sideration was the development of the
child mind in the portraiture of the life
of Christ, and In the moral forces -and
capabilities. , .
The lecturer said he had a suspicion
that if a confession were made often
times it would be found that those who
organized for Sunday school work fre
quently went astray from what was ac
tually in mind to accomplish.
The Bishop caused much amusement in
relating a story of a Sunday school class
being asked by the teacher what was
wanted. "Yes," she asked, "what is
wanted?"
Child after child failed to give a satis
factory reply. One suggested that what
Uvas wanted was money. "No, replied
the teacher. Another gave answer that it
was- books that they needed, and again
the teacher replied that books were not
required. At last a young urchin put up
his hand and the class turned toward
him. "Well, my little man, what is
wanted?" asked the teacher. "Brains!"
shouted the boy. \
The reverend lecturer likened teaching
to our great State of California in that
we have an abundance of products, but
we are not able to get them satisfactor
ily to the market. We should dwell, he
said, to some, extent on that which we
have to teach and how best to get it to
market. The matter Bhould be well de
fined, but he acknowledged that. tha dif
â¢ ficulty was to instill it in the minds of
those who are to be taught. He spoke of
tne power of observation in the. child. It
absorbed a great deal of data, and as It
grew older learned tne explanations. It
was most natural for a child to cry "Our
Father!" and from syllables grew- sen
tences and from sentences came the lin
guist to 3tJr the multitude. TVe teach the
child the Lord's prayer from that cry
"Our Father," and the more we teacn it
the more it becomes a living spirit. The
points. upon. which the Bishop dwelt as
requiring explanation and to be impressed
upon the mind of the child were moral
obligation, duty to God, to neighbor and
to self. Â¦ Â¦â¢

CLOSING LECTURE
Jack Grlgsby, a saloonman who met the
woman known here as Mrs. Aiken and
Ber.iger. was quite positive at first that
it was her body in the Morgue, but has
now. modified his statement to such an
extent as to say the r.esenfblance is only
striking.
De Marsh, who was apparently best ac
quainted with the woman said to be Lyle
Dickey, has not seen her -since her-de
parture shortly after Christmas. During
her .previous sojourn here she called on
him frequently. The : woman he knew
stopped I in lodging-houses. This woman
was undoubtedly familiar with the towri,
as she gave the hackman directions where
.to driyp her on her arrival here, refusing
his suggestion as to the stopping places.
On the other hand the woman who went
to the Imperial Hotel seemed confused at
the depot and made inquiries of a com
mercial man who called at- the morgue
during the evening and said he knew the
dead woman in New York.-
The remains will be .buried to-morrow,
but the date for the inquest is not yet set.
Mr. Sargent, a well known rancher who
knows the Dickey family, says that the
woman in the Morgue bears no resem
blance to any of the members he knew.
The woman whom several parties here
claim was formerly the DicKey girl was
known at the White House as Mrs. Aiken
and at the Courtland lodging-house aa
Mrs. Beninger. While at the latter place
she gave a card party, in which she
printed out her name and address with
artistic flourishes. Between the time the
alleged Dickey woman was here and the

The fact that' she the Mrs. .Ham
moird 'Moore that came to this city last
Hay and took rooms at the Kepelier on
butter street was established yesterday
atternoon at Stockton when Mr. and Mrs.
Foster, who. own the hosLelry, called at
the SiocKton Morgue .and iucntined the
body. Seveial others who visited the
Stockton. Morgue yesterday Identified the
body as that of Lyle Dickey or Mrs. Scal
ly of Sacramento, but as Airs. Scally Is
alive and well this phase of .ne ease
simmers down to a simple matter or mis
taxen identity. Mrs. Moors evidently
bears a remarkable resemblance to the
woman known as Lyle pickey and Mrs.
Scally and there are a few singular cir
cumstances in connection with the case
which tend to draw the name of. JCyle
DicKey into the mystery. .
While Mrs. Hammond Moore lived at
the Repelier she bore every evidence, ol.
being a woman of wealth. Her clothes
were of the finest make and daintiest
texture; her trunks were filled with smart
gowns and her trinkets were well chosen
and costly; she paid her bills at the hotel
promptly and always seemed to have
plenty of money, but it was all a glitter
ing sham. Broken. down in fortune, Me
unfortunate woman sold nearly every ar
ticle of jewelry she possessed to pay her
bills and keep up appearances. Captain
Seymour learned, last night that Mrs.
Moore, -while living. at, the Repelier, had
sold several pieces of jewelry to. the firm
of Sparrows & Goodenough, jewelers, at
107 Geary street. - â¢ Â¦
" Mr Siaf rows called at police headquar
ters last night and produced several re
ceipts signed by. Mrs. Moore upon re
ceiving money from. the firm in the tran
sactions. They correspond to the signa
ture on the register at the Repelier and
the one at the Imperial in Stockton, ex
cept that a well defined effort .to dis
guise the handwriting Is shown. The
signatures on the hotel registers are
i written in a large, bold hand, but the
signatures on the jewelry receipts -are
rather cramped and the individual
strokes of' some, of tha letters in the
signatures are -different, though the gen
eral characteristics of the. hand are
plainly discernible. This is another ex
ample of the hobby the woman, had of
surrounding, everything she did in life
with ap element of confusion.
Sacrifices Her Jewelry.
On September 10 Mrs.' Moore, called on
the jewelers and sold them an old silver
bracelet, two silver stick, pins, one gold
bracelet and a silver neck clasp. For
these articles she .received $13 50. She
called again on September 24 and sold
Sparrows & Goodenough one ring with
eight diamonds In it and another with
five diamonds, a pair of diamond screw
earrings and a diamond scarf pin. The
jewels were costly, but to the jewelers
who had to sell them over again they
Fosters Make Identification.
She was a woman of mystery. That she
came to this coast from New York is
definitely established by Charles Aust in
a letter to Chief of Police' Wittman, but
who her antecedents were or 'where or
how she lived the greater portion of ner
life is a matter .of conjecture, for to the
friends she met in her every-day lire in
this city she confided little of her past.
She spoke of herself very frequently, of
her tiavels and the sights she saw, but
of her relatives, save tne bare mention of
a husband, whose identity she took'very :
good care to confuse, and a nephew whusÂ«
name she never uttered, the woman of
mystery said nothing that" would give the
slightest clew to their "identity. . ;
&-r*-=a HAT the woman who committed ;
I. suicide at the Imperial Hotel in
II Stockton last Friday was the well
: 11 'dressed, refined and well edu-'
cated guest who lived for a time
at the Repelier Hotel. 781 Sutter street,
this city, and who was known there as
Mrs. Hammond Moore, there is no longer
the slightest doubt. In addition to posi
tive identification by people who. knew her
as a guest at the Repelier, other circum
stances have developed in connection with
the ..case which prove"- circumstantially
that she is the same woman. The pecu
liar disposition to confuse and to conceal
her identity just before she made the
fatal plunge into the shadows of death^
crops out here and there in what little Is
known -of her life in this city. She went
by the name of Mrs. Hammond Moore.
That is about all that is known of her
here. Â¦ - >â¢â¢- Â¦
STOCKTON PEOPLE CONFUSED.
The representative of the Pullman Com
pany here said to-night that, the records
of the office did not disclose the name of
Mrs. Hammond-Moore as a passenger
booked for the East or, any near by. point.
Mrs. Hammond-Moore registered at the
Capitol Hotel, this city, December 11, re
maining untU the 19th. Detective Fitz
gerald said to-night he had from the ho
tel register here a copy of Mrs. Ham
mond's signature and had described.it to
the officials at Stockton to see if it agreed
with the signature on the register of ths
Imperial at Stockton.
He said certain peculiarities In the con
struction of different, letters agreed.
Mr. . Scally said that a few days ago
he h.v.d. heard that Mrs. Shepley was at
her Eastern home. â¢
The only possibility of supporting tra
theory that the Stockton suicide is a sia
ter-in-law of Lyle Dickey is that she was
Mrs. Shepley of .Philadelphia. * But 'this
possible support is removed by the posi
tive statement of Mrs. Louis Wagner
that she had received a letter -from Mrs.
Shepley four days ago. The latter was
at her . Philadelphia home when the let
ter was written a few days before.
Mrs. Margaret Dickey, a sister-in-law,
said: "I know Mrs. Scally Is in this city,
for I saw her at 4 o'clock this afternoon.
I do not think she has been out of Sac
ramento for several months." .
znltted suicide. My maiden * name was
Lyle Dicker, but I have not been in
Stockton . within the past two years."
