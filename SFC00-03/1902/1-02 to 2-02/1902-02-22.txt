fruitful topic for editorial artiv
cles and for discussion in all quarters of
Great Britain. One of the most notice
able phases Is the curious effect the; let
ter produced en the wording of, the Times'
editorial on the subject. Its friendliness
to the ex-Premier might easily be ex-<
plained on the ground of Unionist delight
at a definite split in the opposition ranks.
Its declaration that "what -the country
v,ants is not a brand new set of.princi
ples, but a new set of men capable of re
placing the present set without upsetting
the policy of the empire," precedes the
significant demand that â¢ Lord Rosebery's

ernment has been adverse to paying ran
som, but In response to appeals from
every quarter reluctantly authorized Mr.
Leishman to deal with the brigands.
However, if it turns out that the
brigands have broken faith and they
either have taken the ransom, money and
cpirited the captives away again, or that
they have killed them, then there will be
jio further attempt to deal with the
brigands on the part of the United States
Government, but Its entire power will be
<Urected upon Turkey and Bulgaria to
procure the swift and certain extermina

f^#ASHIXGTON. Feb. 2L-It Is esti-
Ifff mated at the State Department
that fifteen days have now elapsed
eince the money for Miss Stone's ransom
â¢was paid over to the agents of the
brigands. At least five days have elapsed
beyond the time fixed in the stipulation to
place her in the hands of her friends.
Thtre is no explanation of the delay. It
Is hoped that physical conditions, such as
heavy snows and adverse weather, may
account for the failure to secure her de
livery. The officials are loath to believe
that there has been a breach of faith on
the part of the brigands, but even if this
â¢were so they do not regard themselves as
blameworthy for having trusted them.

fied as to the correctness of Russia's in
tentions respecting . Manchuria. The
pledges heretofore obtained from Russia

satisfactory unless our Government is

position to do.

Â¦ The Outlook treats the matter lightly.
It says, that- Emperor William "now, as
in China, uses Prince Henry as a bait for
tl:-e German hook. Neither Prince Henry
nor his astute brother, the Emperor, will
ever succeed in weakening the substan
tial grounds upon which Anglo-American
co-cperation now rests."
In the same connection the Outlook ex
presses great satisfaction at Secretary
Hay's note to Russia and commends it
a 3 a strong document, "which gains addi
tional force from its disposal of old-fash
ioned diplomacy."
The Saturday Review, on the other
hand, pursued its customary anti-Ameri
can course and roundly abuses the Gov
ernment for being drawn into a fresh
"humiliating position," and denominates
the whole controversy as an "Interna
tional slanging match."
The Saturday Review declares that. the
disclosures blacken the memory of the
late President McKinley, as they showed
he . followed Bismarck's policy without
Bismarck's excuse, and that he willfully
suppressed Spain^ final capitulation in
order to precipitate war, when he might
manfully have stood out against the pop
ular clamor and secured peace.
"A : . fact which will be written down by
-"the "Â¦historian," saysXthe ': Spectator, . "is
"as well recognized to-day as It will ever be.'
â¢ That Is that England used her influence,
and the Americans know she used it, on the
side of the United States *s against those
â¢who wished to take sides with Spain. A
test of the attitude toward -America dur
ing 'the war displayed by England and
Germany respectively Is found In the re
spective attitudes of the English and Ger
man squadrons toward Admiral Dewey in
Manila Bay. The Germans nearly fired
on the -Americans. If they had done so
the -English would, have acted on the
American side." ' .

attempting to mar the reception to be

prisoner at' the "Southern police station,
charged with committing 'an assault with
a dangerous weapon, and Schmidt lies at
the Emergency Hospital with several cuts
on his face, his left ear and eye.
Schmidt has been" visiting Vincke'3
saloon for a year and had aroused sus^
picion in the minds of both Vlncke % ar.d
his wife owing- to a familiarity which he
had shown toward their daughter Julia,
14 years of age. . Vincka says he fre
quently warned Schmidt that he must
keep away from the girl, tfut notwith
standing the warning yesterday when thÂ©
child was busy, cooking the evening meal
Schmidt sauntered Into the kitchen, which
is at the back of the saloon, and persist
ed, her parents say. In paying his ad
dresses to the little girl. Vlncke ordered
him out and he obeyed the command ct
the girl's father. Later in the evening
he returned, however, at a time when the
bar was being freely patronized. SIra.
Vincke declares that suddenly she was
startled by- seeing blood flow from
Schmidt, but she asserts that she ia
ignorant of how or through whom he re
ceived the injuries. Schmidt was taken
to the hospital and Vlncke is held on tha
charge of assault.
Lasjt evening Julia said that Schmidt
came Into the kitchen and asked her to
kiss him. She refused. Her father had
kept his eye on him , for the reason that
he was suspicious of the man. .Last Sun
day Schmidt wished to accompany Julia
to one of her relatives when he heard that
she intended paying her -a visit. She re
fused to permit him and would not go at
all. He was persistent in requesting to
join her, she says, but she would not con
sent to his going out wltf; her.
Mrs. Vincke corroborated her daughter
and made a startling statement wh'th in
volves both Schmidt and a sailor known
to them as "Joseph." Julia is an intel
ligent child and is a regular attendant at
St. Boniface Church.
At the hospital Schmidt said that Vincke
struck him on the face with a bottle as
he entered the saloon.

Auditor Baehr Says Police Station
Plans Should Have Been Drawn
by City Employes. .
Auditor Baehr yesterday refused to
audit â¢ a . demand for $450 drawn in, favor
of Matthew O'Brien for the plans for the
proposed new sub police station on Fourth
street, near Clara. Baehr claims that
the Architect's Bureau of the Board of
Public WQrka should have drawn the
plans and that the city should not have
been put to any additional expense there
- for. Baehr says that salaries amounting
to more than $800 monthly are paid to
employes of the bureau named and the
work should have been done â¢ by that
office.
-Chief Architect 'Mooser explained to
the Supervisors' Finance Committee. â¢ to
whom the bill was referred, that whein
the bureau was organized under the last
budget it was not intended that plans
should be drawn for any building of > an
elaborate character. He therefore em
ployed O'Brien, whose charge for the
work was less than the regular architect's
fees. Baehr says < he will < not sign the
warrant, and says ' that O'Brien was re
cently paid the sum of $525 for drawing
plans for three schoolhouses which should
have been done by the regular staff of

to Washington was made during lunch at
1 o'clock. Dr. Warren, the school physi

to a change of the patient at this time.
Dr. Rlxey . gave his opinion that the boy
would stand the journey all right, and"
that the weather at this time was proba

gotiations had been entered into some
time ago between the London representa

LOKDON, Feb. 21.â The Secretary of the 1
Admiralty, H. O. ..Arnold-Poster, intro- ]
duced the naval estimates for 1902-03 in the {
House of Commons to-day. The estimates
show a total of Â£21,255,000, as compared
with Â£80.875.000 last year. In the course
of an accompanying statement Arnold- |
Foster remarked that no thinking maun
could have anticipated any reduction from
the estimates of last year, in view of the ]
fact that the army was engaged in a dif- I
ficult conflict 7000 miles away. .:-"-Â¦". , -\
In regard to the naval ' reserve, the Sec
retary of the Admiralty said the Govern
ment had discovered that there were legal :
objections to the engagement of men in
Newfoundland. The . movement would
therefore be temporarily arrested, but
legislation would ' be introduced legaliz
ing the engagement of men in every part
of the empire. :\ .
The Secretary further explained, that
promotion In the engineering department
would be accelerated by the creation of
ten new posts. He also said that the pro
gress of naval construction-' during the
past year had been unparalleled. The
present estimates, said the Secretary,
pave the Government Â£15,000,000 for new
ships and it was intended to spend the
money. No fewer than forty-nine ships
would be put In the water dur
ing the present . year and next
vear there would be under con
struction sixty ships, in addition to
twenty-seven others that would be laid
down. Besides .this, a large programme
of reconstruction would be undertaken,
thereby adding greatly to the lighting
power of the fleet. Guns of more formid
able caliber would be mounted on many
vessels and six-inch guns of the latest and
most improved type would replace the
4.7-inch guns.
Referring to the smaller craft, the Sec
retary said that . unexpectedly rapid
progress was being made with the sub
marine fleet and that several vessels
would be added to this fleet. A new type
of torpedo boat destroyer had been de
signed and it was hoped to obtain better
results than in the case of the existing
vessels.
After giving further details t)f the Ad
miralty's programme, the Secretary con
cluded by saying that what the Admiralty
was determined on was to prepare the
fleet for war, a preparation for that day
of trial which it was /hoped would never
come. t>ut against which the Admiralty
was in duty bound to provide.

A. Grand Rapids gentleman who represents
& prominent manufacturing: concern and trav-
els through ' Central and Southern Michigan
relates the following; regarding the new ca-
tarrh cure. He cays:
"After Buffering from catarrh of the head,
throat and stomach, for several years, I heard
of Stuart's Catarrh Tablets quite accidentally
and like everything else I Immediately bought
a package and was decidedly surprised at the
Immediate relief it afforded me and etill more
to find a complete cure after several weeks'
use. ,7'*v
"I have a little son who sings in a boys'
choir in *ne of -our prominent churches, and
he Is greatly troubled with hoarseness and
throat weakness, and on my return home from
a trip I pave him a few of the tablets Â¦ one
Sunday morning when he had complained of
hoarseness. He was delighted with their ef-
fect, removing all huskiness In a. few minutes
and making the voice clear and strong.
"Am the tablets are very pleasant to the
taste, I had no difficulty In persuading him to
use them regularly.
â¢"Our family physician told us they were
fji antiseptic preparation of â¢ undoubted ', merit
and that he himself had no hesitation In using
and recommending Stuart's Catarrh Tablets
-for any form of catarrh.
"I have since met many public speakers and
â¢ professional singers who used them constantly .
A prominent Detroit lawyer told me that Stu-
art's Catarrh - Tablets kept his throat in fine
shape during the most trying weather, and
that he had long eince discarded the use of
cheap lozenges and troches on the advice of
his physician that they contained bo much
tolu, potash and opium as to render their use
a danger to health." . / ;.
Stuart's Catarrh - Tablets are large, pleas-
Eant tasting lozenges composed of â¢ catarrhal
antiseptics, like Red Gum, Blood Root, etc..
and eold by druggists everywhere at i CO cents
for full treatment. . , . Â¦ , .Â¦ .. .. -
They act upon the blood and mucous mem-
brane and their composition and remarkable
success has won the . approval of physicians,
as well as thousands of euff erers . from - nasal

1900, was hanged, this* morning in San
Quentln prison. - Just twenty-one seconds
elapsed from the time the murderer left

ascending I the . scaffold Dailey displayed
no fear. As the ; hangman adjusted the
noose the condemned man raised hte eyes
sllghtly.Tand as the black cap was sllpj)e:l
over his head he clenched his fists tightly.
Rev. Father Eagan offered a' last prayer
for the murderer and at 10:40 o'clock War

fell. ; Fourteen - minutes later the phy3i
cians pronounced life extinct. ..
The crime : for, which Dailey paid the
death penalty was committed in Le
moore, Kings County. Lemuel Metz,. a
bicycle repairer and a man with a large
family, was the victim. Dailey went to
Metz's place of business with a bicycle
to- have a puncture repaired.. After the
work was completed he Informed " Metz
that he did not have the 25 cents to pay
him, to which Metz replied that he could
settle the next day. . On the second day
Dailey, again appeared with a punctured
tire and the. bicycle dealer repaired It.
The ; same excuse was given, whereupon
Metz told Dailey that he did no credit
business.
"Oh, you don't, do you?" sneered Dailey,
as he left the shop.

arid mizzen masts was reduced, but the
ship . could . hot ; be . got under i control and
was going ashore.' Anchors were lowered
but parted; and for some hours the ship
drifted toward the shore. The boats had
been put . over and provisioned and at 3
o'clock inthe morning the crew went aft
and said it intended to leave the ship.
The captain refused to allow this, but
officers 'and ; crew rushed to the boats,
leaving ' him alone. He then hailed one
of Â¦ the boats, ; which returned and took
him off, leaving the vessel adrift. All
hands passed tnirty. hours In the half
filled open boats before they were picked
up by the steamer Abergeldle, which
took them- to Sydney. " ' _. ,
Two days afterward the tug Champion
picked up the : derelict and took her to
Sydney.:- About the same, time the tug
Eagle was trying to put a line on board.
Both tugs- neared the abandoned vessel
at the same Â¦ time and lowered boats,
which " raced toward the â¢ Port Patrick
through a rough sea. The j phampion's
boat arrived first â¢ and . four men boarded
the Port Patrick; They pulled up air the
ropes to prevent the men in. the Eagle's
boat getting on board. ;Two of the Cham
pion's nien ' stood r at ...the', ship's side,
swinging axes and threatening any of the
Eagle's men who boarded. They said the,
vessel was theirs by possession . and de
clined to allow the Eagle to participate in
the salvage. The Eagle then , steamed
away and the tug Champion managed , to
get -lines aboard. ; ..'' .Â¦ .
The ship.whlch had all sail set, although
tome of it was much ribboned, was towed
to Sydney and the 'Champion had filed a
big salvage claim against her, which was
being brought In ; the Admiralty Court at
Sydney when, the Miowera left.
The Champion's crew reported that, it
was only by a fluke that the vessel was
not. wrecked. .She was hemmed in by
rocks when found and had it not been
that heranchor caught. in. the cleft of a
rock, she" would have pounded to match

WASHINGTON, Feb. 21â A severe
sleetstorm struck Washington to-night
and the national capital is absolutely cut
off from all telephonic or telegraphic com
munication north of Baltimore and Is
compelled . to depend, on uncertain Wires
to Richmond and Atlanta for reaching the
country at iarge. Aside -from damage to
wires, however, the storm did no injury,
the sleet ! not- being' heavy -enough to do
much harm to trees.
PITTSBURG, TFeb. 21â Anxiety was in
creased to-day along the .'-, Monongahela
and Alleghany rivers, ' where great ; ice
gorges have formed, by the continued' rain
and the prospects of warmer weather.
River men of years' experience say that
with the present weather, . conditions last
ing, the ice is due . to . move by Sunday.
Owners of Imperiled property along the
river and the officials of the river coal
combine are preparing to move their ef
fects so as to be clear of the impending
danger. The great gorge i" on the Alle
ghany, River, which extends seventy miles
up'the river and varies in-thickness from
five to sixteen feet, Â¦ : is Â¦ being - watched
night and day by the river men and early
warnings are to be given when it begins
to ; move. It is still hoped that the rain
will ceaÂ«e and that the thaw will be a
slow one, so that the ice may melt and
move out slowly. . . -
Fears of an Avalanche.
â¢ South : and west of York telegraph
and telephone wires were prostrated early
in the afternoon, and although conditions
improved- somewhat * between.' New
and Chicago late in; the evening,' com
munication by wire with Philadelphia' and
Baltimore, was cut off entirely. . . ?
Jersey City was hit hard and by 10 o'clock
in, the evening the city practically was in
darkness and there < was j every, indication
that the electric service, which is wholly
overhead, will be entirely out of order by
morning. Electric wires were ; down: in
every part of the city. 'The fire alarm sys
tem, was crippled and the police wires are
in ' bad â¢ shape. Trolley Â¦ cars 'ceased run
ning entirely late: in the evening. . All
trains in and out of Jersey City were be
hind time. The departing trains were de- '<
layed. by the ferryboats,- which cbnsumed : ;
thrice the usual in* crossing the
NorthRiver.:' At Newark the streets were
ankle deep in slush. >...Â¦ ,:, .
- During the early hours I of the day
heavy, wet snow, fell : in Â¦' great, flakes.
This condition prevailed, for. several hours.'*
Shortly after noon the snow turned- Into
a ! steady drizzle, of, rain, that continued
with intermittent periods.of slee,t allafter
noon and far. into the night. Much of the
snow .that was left from the recent bliz
zard . was quickly converted â¢ into slush,
and to-night j the streets {are 'Â¦ inches I deep.
The sidewalks throughout the city : . were
covered and. the crossings were almost im
passable. The: work of the Street Clean
ing Department was undone and the city's
streets are in a worse, condition- than De
fore thousands of snow shovelers went to
work after the blizzard. ;
Â¦ During the evening the temperature
dropped enough to turn the downpour of
rain into a coating of ice over buildings
and trees. In Central. Park the big trees
creaked under the weight of thick ice.
Many branches fell. This condition pre
vails throughout other parks in. the city.
Tratflc on the Brooklyn bridge was almost
at a standstill: He* vy trucks v could
scarcely be moved, even when, four heavy
horses --did - their. - best, to get .a foot
hold on the slippery roadway. Street
car traffic every wnere was much r inter
rupted, but the. greatest difficulty was ex
perienced on crosstown horse .car; lines.
! four horses were attached to each of
these cars and had hard work getting
along.:. .. . il-l . â¢. ; . .'-. . .
; Ice Barriers in Streets.
Fifth avenue was a sheet of ice. It was
early deserted by carriages and ' by mid
night nothing, save an â¢ occasional auto
mobile, was to be seen on the; thorough
fare. On . Broadway > after â¢ the theaters
closed' the scene was, one of great I confu
sion.' Cabs and carriages,- drawn up in
front of the theaters, were handled , with
great difficulty. Many horses, fell. The
automobiles had less trouble than the car
riages, although they were hard to handle. 1
Many electric light wires were broken by
the weight of the coating of Ice and many
others hung low. In Fifth avenue the
sidewalk along Central Park, where the
trees overhang it,- was almost impassable
o wing Â¦ to the branches which were bent
almost to the earth.

Acme Arrives Safely.
The overdue American ship Acme ar
rived yesterday at Yokohama: She^^ras
from New York and has been 204 days
making the trip. Twenty per cent rein
surance has been paid on her. i
Fort George Makes Slow Trip.
The British ship Fort George, which ar
rived yesterday at Port Pirie. has made
one of the slowest voyages on record. She
left Chemainus one -hundred and. thirty
seven days ago. Although never placed
on the reinsured list, considerable" anxiety
was felt for her safety, especially as ves
sels leaving this side about the same time
as the Fort George arrived in Antipodean
ports long ago. The average passage for
a sailing vessel from British Columbia to
Port Pirie is about eighty days.
Chinese Runs Amuck on Albatross.
Waii Ping, a Chinese cook on board the
United States ship Albatross, ran amuck
yesterday morning in the men's quarters
and wai about to "shoot up" the berth
deck, when Able Seaman Johnson dis
armed him. Ping likes his opium and.
Â¦while recovering from a dream, quarreled
with one of the pallors. The sailor laughed
at Ping, and. with merry marine Jest and
an occasional dig in the ribs, riled the
heathen temper. Another Jest and Ping
chased his tormentor for several laps
around the "fish boat's" deck and finally
cornered him on the berth deck. Ping
pulled a revolver and was about to shoot
when Johnson, who was lying In a ham
mock close to Ping's head, with one hand
CTabbed the gun and with thej other
Ping's pigtail. The gun was thrown to
the deck. Johnson then took a couple of
turns In the pigtail and yanked Ping into
the hammock. The seaman proceeded to
juggle Ping on his knees and fists and
had a very weary Chinese on his hands
when the master at arms came along and
took Ping to the guardhouse.
Queen Adelaide's Hard Luck.
The- British steamship Queen Adelaide,
which arrived yesterday at Singapore
from Seattle, had more than one ship's
share of hard luck during the J voyage.
She was battered fore and aft by numer
ous ..norms. Everything on her decks that
Eeas could tear loose was carried over
board. She was in collision and had the
marks to show for It when she reached
Singapore. She also struck some sunken
rocks, as several dented plates testify,
and arrived in port with her ballast tanks
leaking. She will bei.surveyed after her
cargo has been discharged. The repairs
that will be necessary are expected to be
quite extensive.
pÂ»r*^ HE steamship Australia sailed at
| ! 2 o'clock yesterday for Tahiti with
1 1 passengers and a full cargo. As
La, the linor pulled away from the
wharf the skies were black and
tlireatcnins and thc~raln poured down in
torrents. It was a winter picture,, but
Captain Lawless promised his passengers
that within a few days they could wear
duck suits and would appreciate awnings
to shelter them from the sun. Among the
Australia's cargo was about 70JQ pounds
of fresh meat for the Tahig' market/
Thomas McComb has been Appointed

The Sydney* Morning Herald, comment-
Ing on the trip, says it is possible .that the
Gauss may have arrived at the island 1 be-'
fore the Tanglhr reached Â¦ there. This
would cause a dejay of a year in the work
of the expedition, as it would make the
task of getting southward into the Ice
so much later In the season and per
haps render it impossible until the fol
lowing summer. As for the men left on
the island, they would be marooned for
some time, although, fortunately, not
without food. . ,
Kerguelen Island "is seldom visited. Cap
tain Neuhaus of \ the Tanglin says there
are no trees 1 thereâ nothing but stunted
vegetation. The land runs almost sheer
from the water's edge. The English ex
pedition which was there in 1874 had left
a number' of rabbits and'these hadmul
tiplied wonderfully. -A few penguins were
caught on shore, but they died on the
voyage to Sydney. A number of cormo
rants were captured and were used as
food by the Chinese servants. Two; Chi
nese died on the island and were burled
there and two others who died on board
were buried at sea. - "V
The . landing of the stores was difficult.
At first, the, officers tried to land their
cargo with two boats lashed together,
but the -seal was -so rough -that this was
found impracticable, and finally the ship
was brought in close to a large rock, by
the waters* -edge and kept off -shore "by
two anchors. The booms for liftingVthe
cargo were unshipped and erected~ashore,
and the crew worked day after day until
the . 500 tons of provisions for. the expe
dition had been landed. 'On December 21
the Tanglin started for Sydney, leaving
the members of the expedition to await
the Gauss. "

TACOMA, Feb. 21.â Dr. Mary Chisholm
has just returned to Juneau from Hoonah,
Â¦where she went at the request of Gov
ernor Brady to stamp out smallpox, which
has been epidemic there for a number of
months. She attended nine cases of viru
lent smallpox and vaccinated nearly 150
members of the tribe. There were no
deaths while she was there. Under her
direction every house in- Hoonah was
scrubbed and thoroughly disinfected. She
says the Hoonaih Indians are very clean
ly, have well-arranged houses and are
v.'ell advanced in matters of civilization.
To this she attributes the email number
of deaths occurring since the tribe con
tracted smallpox from the Sitka Indians
early last summer. She was bravely as
sisted in her* work by Rev. John Carle,
a missionary who is devoting his life to
the betterment of the Hoonah and sur
rounding tribes.

SAN JOSE, Feb. 22.â Rev. J. S. Suc
chesl, In charge of the Holy Cross Mis-
Eion in Alaska, has made an appeal for
aid for the plague stricken and destitute
Eskimos, who were great sufferers from
the plague that swept over northern
Alaska last year. The letter, which was
eddressed to Father Kenna of Santa
Clara, and which was more than four
months on its way, is as follows:
. Â¦ Holy Cross Mission,
Koeerefsk}- Postoffice, Alaska,
.October S. 1901.
Rev. R. E. Kenna. S. J. â Rev. and Dear
Father in Christ: The Alaska Mission of the
Yukon finds itself in sore need of help, owing
to a devastating plague, which has raged late
ly among: the Ksiumcs, and which in a short
tirr.s carried off one-half of the population.
It would be too long to describe, the tale cf
horror witnessed by the missionaries during
Oie plague. Sufflce it to eay that the well
oaee fled from chelter, from food and from
home, abandoning the eick to their fate, amidst
the unburied remains cf the dead and expou
ins themselves to the horrors of starvation.
'Xhe missionaries exerted themselves to their
utmost nursing the sick, assisting the dying:,
burying: the aead and distributing with un
sparing hand every means at command, leav
ing the mission exhausted and in a crippled
condition, struggling to keep on with its work
and its schools. We cannot think of aban-
Conmgr the field or of sending adrift the or
r^aris whom the fearful plague left upon' qur
uands, but we ehall continue the work begun
confiding in God's providence and trusting in
the efficacy of this appeal to your generosity.
Hoping you will contribute something and pray
Ijt the conversion of these natives, I am sin
cerely jours in Sacred Heart of Jesus,
REV. J. S. SUCCHESI, S. J.
Contributions can be sent to Father
Kenna or direct to the mission.

INTEBTBIBAIi MASSACRES
ON â¢ SOUTH SEA ISLANDS
White Missionary Barely Escapes
Murder at the Hand3 of a
Native.
VICTORIA. B. C. Feb. 21.â From the
islands of the south seas the Mlowera to
day brought news of further Intertribal
fights between the blacks. The steamer
Mambare/ which arrived at Sydney from
an Island cruise, reported that while she
was at Santo a fight occurred there. A
party of head hunters stole into the vil
lage of the home tribes at night and
slaughtered a number, of natives, carry-
Ing away the heads, as is the custom. In
revenge for this attack; a march waa
made by tho villagers through the bush
to the village from which the flrst expedi
tion came and seven men were killed and
eaten.
The Mambare reported that Mr. Ander
son, assistant to Dr. McKenzle, the mis
sionary at < Santo, was attacked while
visiting a native village and had a nar
row ' escape. He was within . a few yards
of one of the huts when a native stepped
out ' and pointed a gun at him. The na
tive pulled the "trigger, but -the. cap waa
damp and the - gun . missed fire. ' Mr. ' An
derson took to his heels and escaped. *
\. The. report .also shows that another di
rector Of the bank was liable to the bank
as payer for $23,000/ whereas the complaint
says â¢ the ; true amount . should have been
$45,412 20. ' F. C' Andrews as indorser wa*
reported to be liable for $37,000, when the
complaint, says he should be liable In this
capacity/ for $142,432 45. The report indi
cated that Andrews was not liable in ,any
amount for overdraft,'- whereas, the com-,
plaint says, his account was overdrawn
$149,133 55. â¢ The complaint charges that
these discrepancies were- made with tho
intent of deceiving the bank examiners.
â¢- The report gave thÂ© amount of .currency
as $140,585, when the true, amount. accord-
Ing to the complaint, was $40,062 50. Â¦ Â¦ Tho
amount of gold coin given in the report
as held In the bank was $28,292 50, while
the complaint declares the true amount
was' $6670. The amount o/ silver was given
in the report at $19,102 15 inste%d of
$7036 50. the true amount/ according. to the
complaint. The J amount of < commercial
deposits recorded In the report was $745,
827 65, whereas the complaint declares the
right figure to have been $943,287. - The
report indicated that F. C. Andrews was
not liable in any amount to the bank as
payer, .when, the' : complaint .declares, he
really was liable at that time for $92,800.
The complaint recites that the -report
set forth that there was $S0,S95 74 In banks
in reserve cities, Â¦whereas the true amount
was $236,895 74. The report states that
there was in other banks $36,750 67, when,
the complaint states, there was but $15,
750 67. The report states that in exchange
for clearing-house there was $97,596 90, and
of. checks, cash items, interest and rev
enue accounts ?082 79, when the proper
amount for these two items should have
been $32,368 74. /
Andrews was arraigned ' in the Police
Court and his counsel asked that he" be
released under this charge on his personal
recognizance, In view of the fact that the
bail on the two former complaints against
him. totals 525,000; arid Is . ample. Judge
Whelan declined to grant the request and
fixed the bail at $50,000. This was not
furnished. Andrews' examination was
set for February 28, the date of his ex
amination on -the other two complaints.
Â¦ The complaint made to-day alleges falsi
fication'of the report which was supposed
to show the condition of the bank at the
close, of business February 5, 1901. The
complaint charges that the loans and dis
counts in the alleged falsified reports were
$15,000 out of the way. In tho matter x>f
overdrafts the report -stated â¢ that they
amounted to $193 58, whereas the books
show, â¢ according â¢ to Â¦ the complaint, that
they amounted to $198,987 58.

Judge Cook said that from the evidence
he felt something had been done to make
the defendant leaver the room and go for
his pistol. It was a pity that he ever re
turned to It. It might be that he simply
got the pistol to preserve order or to In
timidate Griffin, as he had stated. If so
there were extenuating circumstances.
The remark made by the defendant In
stantaneously with the report of the pis
tolâ"My God, I did not intend to kill
him"â showed that he meant what he
said, as there was no time to concoct
anything. The jury by Us verdict had ac- .
quitted him of malice. Technically the de
fendant was guilty of manslaughter, and
by the verdict of the Jury the law had
been vindicated. The defendant was not of
the criminal class, and there was no rea
son why society should require his long in
carceration. He was strongly ot the belief
that the shooting was accidental, and he
thought a sentence of five years' impris
onment in San Quentin would be ade
quate.
Gillesple said, "I thank your . Honor,"
when . the sentence was pronounced.
Former Judge Ferral, counsel for i de
fendant, asked for a stay of six days,
which was granted.
Before God I did not intend to kill that
man. My sole object was to intimidate him
and I was horrified . when the pistol exploded.
Three years ago whtn I was taking part in an
election campaien 1 was held up and ' robbed
on my way home from the California Hotel
and I bought - that pistol. I placed it in my
de3k and never had occasion to use It from
that time till the night of the shootlne of
Griffin. ' I call God to witness that I am in
nocent of that man's blood and I beg your
Honor to be merciful in passing Judgment upon
me. SS2flB
When George D. Glllesple, Â¦who was con
vited of manslaughter for shooting and
killing; William F. Griffin In a. lodging
house at 119 Ninth street street August

Judge Cook asked him if he had anything
to say why sentence should not be passed
upon him. Gillesple then made an impas
sioned appeal, saying:

In a statement made to A. de la Torre

was born in Guatemala and was 16 years
of age. She claimed she met Basset at
the house of a woman named Clara Ar
rellanes, and then they became very
friendly. Basset called upon her mother,
the girl gays, and agreed to bring her to
San Francisco for three months.
Just prior to the departure of the steam

Arrellanes woman good-by, and was
locked in a. room until she was taken
aboard the stemaer, and shared Basset's
cabin with. him all the way up, he pass

Basset kept her there under the same
conditions as he did on the steamer The

whom he introduced as his wife, she be
ing a Guatemalan of prepossessing ap
pearance and unable to speak a word of
English. One of the passengers informed

BROTHERS STRIVE
FOR THE ESTATE
Boyd analyzed the evidence of many of
the principal witnesses for the defense
and brought to light many,. inaccuracies,
many contradictions and many discrep
ancies. He ' compared the testimony of
Richard Nichols, Samuel Parks and Isora
Â»Eades with that of other witnesses for
the defense, " apparently disproving the
alibis claimed for the three ,- men men
cloned. â¢-â¢Â¦ The - testimony " of Judge -Myers
-was . reviewed, .. and Boyd ' declared . that
the aged suspect' knew of the plans "of
the lynchers almost a week before the
crime was consummated. "Jim" Brown's
â¢statements to Myron Ayres and Charles
Lambert, made on the day of the inquest,
were read to the jury, tending to prove
that Brown knew, of the intention of the
mob several days before' he spoke of it
to Erving Carpenter, as testified to by
Carpenter. : Speaking of . Brown's state
ment* that he went out ' on the â¢Â¦ porch on
the night of the lynching and lighted a
cigar, Boyd brought his argument to a
ciose In;- the following appeal to the jury
to do its duty. ;; i. \
Gentlemen, the match "Jim" Brown struck
on that porch the night of the lynching lighted
poor little Martin Wilson's soul out to the
great beyond, and lighted' "Jim" Brown's
torch on hie way to the gallows. .' It is a sad
thing to ; stand here and - deprive a fellow citi
zen Of his life, or may be. his liberty.;- But it
Is not a matter of sentiment either way. It
is. a matttr of evidence only, and. we rely. upon
the sacred , honor . of Modoc' s jury to return Â¦ a
verdict according to the evidence adduced - In
this case. I ask you. not to do anything unfair
to this defendant, not to deprive him -of any
right; But you have taken your . oath .that
you will abide by the evidence and follow, the
instructions which will, be given to you by the
court.-' I "'- "''-''Â¦'' ' .
The prosecution- in this case asserts that no
matter whether, the processes for the- arrest
of the Halls, Yantls and Martin Wilson, were
on good grounds or bad, the manner in which
those processes were executed showed a malig
nant heart and showed from the first a pur
pose to destroy those people. They had them,
hanging In their hearts on the 25th of May,
when they -made the arrests; when they put
the strap around the neck of Martin Wilson
and said: "Confess or we'll hang you." Law
abiding citizens do' not take a 13-year-old boy
and put a strap around â¢ his . neck and . eay
"confess." -,. They. did. not give him his day in
court, such' as this defendant now demands.
There Is no evidence before you as to In
famous conduct of those men arrested, aa
claimed by Mr. Harris and Mr.* Raker. If
those men had been such outlaws and such
infamous and damnable thieves for eo many
years, why did not Mr. Raker, when he was
District Attorney, seÂ« that they were punished?
Previous to discussing the testimony, of
witnesses in the case . Boyd asserted em
phatically : that during his argument Ra
ker misread the Â¦ official ' transcript , in
many instances, to the disadvantage of
witnesses. Boyd claimed that both Ra
ker and Harris had argued, on matters
net before the jury in. this case; ; that .in.
reading the testimony they cut "out ma
terial answers to material questions. To
substantiate his . assertion * Boyd | took up
the testimony, of Agnes Wilson, Lafe
Harris, Thomas Howell, Heter Hager
mnn, Domingo Simas. and others and
showed, where Harris and Raker had mis
quoted them. .â¢-.. - . , ? ~ â¢
Much Contradictory Testimony. "
.Plotted Before the Arrests.
Answering the queries of the counsel for the
defense as â¢ to why " I ' am here,' I 'will say I

' George Meredith, the oldest, as without
question the most original and inspired of
modern English romancers, has this week
entered on his* seventy r flfth year. His
first; appearance in print, in the Bhape of
a book of poems; was in 1S51, when he was
23 years of age. It is rather remarkable
that though his most popular romance
"The Ordeal: of Richard Feveril," was
published = forty-three years , ago, it was
not until many years afterward that Mer
edith's genius Â¦ as / a novelist was recog
nized. Meredith has published 'altogether
twenty-seven ; books, his last- novel, "The
Case ; of General ;OpIe arid Lady Camer,"'
being issued in 1S93.
A waggish correspondent suggests that
perhaps, the necessities and decencies
might be "combined ; if Lord Reay, ths
chairman of the School Board, would' give
an undertaking and prescribe "Elvina" as
a reading book for the new school.
Perhaps the present generation has not
read either '.'Elvina" or the "Diary of
Madame d'Arblay," in which case thero
should be a good opening for an enter
prising publisher. The elect* may know
that Miss ArvuW did not' enjoy herself
on her sole visit to the "Long Room," but
though the company was very Ill-bred
one young gentleman begged the favor of
hopping a dance with her. Another flirted
with her in that charming fashion which
endears Smith Xo "every reader of taste.
"My dear ma'am," said : thls= would-be
sprig;Of. fashion, "you. must be a little
more patient. I assure you I have no bad
designsâ I have not, upon my wordâ but
really, there's no resolving upon such a
thing as matrimony all at once, what
with the; loss of one's liberty, and what
with the' ridicule of one's acquaintance.
I asure you, ma' am,. you are the first lady
who ever made me even demur upon this
subject, for, a.fter all, my, dear ma'am,
marriage Is the'devil.".
. An Interesting controversy has ' been
aroused by the attempt of the London
School Board to find a suitable site for its
new school at Hampstead. There has
been a lack of certainty as to the houses
which actually represent the historic
"Long ' Room," but. the uncertainty has
been dispelled by a letter which H. O.
Rooth, the ultimate .owner of -the prop
erty, has sent to the press. Roofh found
among his' title deeds, he states, some in
.which the house is recited as having been
converted out of some assembly-rooms,
and he has confirmatory evidence in an
engraving of the "Long Room," published
about the time when Elvlna visited it
against. her' will. That, of course, is the
chief literary association of the> building,
although It was visited by "Pope and
Akenslde, and at a later day Keats loved*
to linger In it.
Now that Lord Dufferin's life is closed
many papers refer, among the . dead no
bleman's many talents, to what he has
done for English literature, but Lord
Dufferin's connection with his literary an
cestors were incidental . rather than per
sonal. He was the great-grandson on the
mother's side of Richard Brinsley Sheri
dan, to. whose career s ot worldly failure
his- own presented such ; an extraordinary
contrast, though, sad to say, it closed un
der one cloud of misfortune. Lord Duf
ferin's mot her was a woman of rare charm
and many accomplishments. Her song,
"The Irish Emigrant," is sure of a very
long life. It was from her undoubtedly
he inherited his wit' and all-round bril
liancy. Lord Dufferin was accustomed to
say that in the last ISO 'years the Sheri
dans, who once had been a great territo
rial family, had produced twenty-seven
authors and more than 200 books. To these
he contributed some half-dozen, of which
the best known is hi3 "Letters From High
Latitude."
Publishers apparently are not looking
forward to very good times yet awhile.
They have some fear of the coronation
festivities interfering with the book trade.
At any rate, I learn that comparatively
few novels are being issued or being pre
pared for the press. A great many al
ready arranged for are being held over
till the autumn.

GOSSIP FROM
LONDON WORLD
OF LETTERS
Let another element be taken into account. The
public officers who administer municipalities are.
nominated in p2rty conventions and elected at the
I/oIIs. The expert talent required to work a proper
accounting system is not in politics. Great" indus
trial corporations do not recruit their auditing divi
sion in that way. It is filled on merit and fitness
alone. If every two years those corporations sub
mitted their accountants to political selection, how
long would they avoid bankruptcy? Yet the propo
nents, of municipal ownership propose that every
year, or two or four years, the management of pub
lic .service utilities shallbe changed by the' popular
vote and by party methods, and yet. it is expected
ihat by some sorcery or conjuring that management
shall be a public benefit, and not a public waste!
We cannot regard the prospect as implying anything
else than an enlargement of wasteland therefore in
sist that all such, experiment shall be^ preceded by a
drastic reform of niethods in administering the du
ties'of municipal government as they exist now.;
We are unable to conceive why the proponents of
municipal paternalism as a rule oppose the institution
of accounting reform as a condition precedent to cm
barking in these new ventures. Some of them say
that added responsibility will bring reform.' When'
and where has that been the result? Has it done it
:n New York, or Philadelphia, in Boston, Chicago.
Toledo or Kansas City? No. The new objects of
administration have been dumped upon a grossly de
fective system of public business and a method of ac
counting lhat does not account, and the waste has
been multiplied.
Yet here are municipal corporations, already ad
ministering school, police, fire, street, sewer and
other governmental concerns, under a system of ac
counting so defective that in one city $25,000,000 a
j-ear is lost, in part of another $500,000, and hx all
various sums great or small, and without any amend
ment of accounts or reforms of system it is proposed
to expand their administration over light, railroad,
water, telephone and power plants, thereby enlarg
ing administration and its resulting waste.
It is in view of these conditions that we advise im
provement in accounting before any further experi
ments are made in municipal ownership and pater
nalism. Suppose that the United States Steel Com
pany had taken over all the coal and iron mines, the
coke plants, smelters, converters, rolling mills and
machinery of all the companies which compose it,
and had thus expanded its administration over an in
finite variety of operations without subjecting them
all. to a common and completely expository system
of accounting, does any one believe that it could have
run six months successfully?
There is evidence, constantly accumulating, that
our form of government is the most, costly known
because of the lack of exact accounting.- Comptroller
Coler of New York City has publicly stated, as the
result oi his experience of four years as the account
ing officer of that city, that the introduction of an ex
act system of public accounting would save the city
the enormous sum of $25,000,000 annually. The same
is affirmed of the situation in Philadelphia, Boston,
Chicago and the other, large cities of the country.
There is no doubt that San Francisco has nothing to
boast in this respect over the other cities of the
country. '
f~*^ IVIL government may learn something from
I the policy of the great industrial combina-
tions, which in some of their aspects , terrify
the country. As far as their affairs are made public
it is seen at once that their profits consist largely; 01
savings in administration, effected by an exact sys
tem of accounting. All great railway systems se
cure at any cost accounting systems and accountants,
to the end that every mill received may be traced to
its proper application to the legitimate purposes of
the corporation.
PUBLIC OWNERSHIP AND AC
COUNTS.
UNCLE SAM SUGGESTS AN ANSWER TO THE EASTERN QUEST/ON
, Mr. Nimmo says: "What is now needed is an in
quiry relating to the organization of our vast Ameri
can railway system, its relations to the social, com
mercial and industrial interests of the country, the
benefits which it has -conferred, the evils which have
incidentally arisen , in the course . of its \ development,
and. the proper course to be pursued in an attempt to
cure those evils." > 'â¢
It will not be questioned that the proposition is'
timely, but/the country will hardly agree with Mr.
Nimmo that Congress should do Â¦ nothing to
strengthen, the hands of.;the Interstate Commerce
Commission until the. investigation has been made.
The issue just now is that of enforcing the interstate
commerce law and. 'compelling obedience to United
States statutes. Upon a question: of that kind there
is iio room for differences of opinion, and Congress
should act upon it at once.
That is certainly. a notable array, of good results,
and even if allowance be made for possible exaggera
tion they. would still constitute a strong argument in
favor "of the, proposed investigation. A great deal
has been written about our railway problems from
well nigh every conceivable point of view. Statis
ticians, lawyers, railway men, political economists^
statesmen, agitators and . even novelists have taken
part in augmenting the mass of the railway literature
of the country. Still there has never been any com
prehensive study of the subject such as is proposed;
for the one investigation made by Congress, the Sen
ate .inquiry of â¢ 1886, which resulted in the interstate
commerce act, was directed mainly to certain specific
evils which had been complained of, and did not un
dertake to deal with the issue as a whole. :
Of the work of the British Â¦ cqrnmissions â¢ Mr.
Nimmo says: "In their various reports all the more
important commercial, economic and political condi
tions governing the railroad transportation question
in Great Britain have been investigated and reported
upon. Theories and. notions about railroad manage
ment and regulations. have also been reported upon
âsome of them quite as visionary and absurd as those
which now command attention in this country. As
ar result of these elaborate. Parliamentary inquiries
abuses of various sorts have been abated, mistaken
ideas in regard to the management and regulation of
railroads of Great Britain have been corrected, sen
sible remedial expedients have been adopted, many
questions at issue have . been amicably settled and
public discontent has been allayed."
In making this'plea Mr. Nimmo cites the good re
sults which have followed the adoption of the plan
by the British Government. Parliament has repeat
edly investigated the "relations of railways to. public
interests and has thus kept posted on the changes
which are incessantly taking place both in commerce
and in railway transportation. As an illustration of the
frequency of these Parliamentary investigations Mr.
Nimmo points out that they took place in 1840, 1844,
.1846, 1852, 1865, 1872, 1881, 1888 and 1893.- In .striking
contrast to the British policy, stands that of the t
United States, for, despite the fact * that we have
nearly 200,000. miles of â¢ railroad while Great Britain'
and Ireland have but 22,000 miles? there", has been but.
one investigation of the kind in this- country since
the advent, of railroads. / . '.'
JOSEPH NIMMO JR.; the well-known statist
tician and economist, has contributed to the
discussion'of our railway problems a plea for a
full and thorough investigation of the-whole subject
by a Congressional committee j before ; any further
legislation on the, subject is undertaken.. He would
postpone for the present any increase of the powers:
of the Interstate , Commerce Commission, or any
amendment of the actsVdevised for the regulation of
interstate commerce. He "would have the whole is
sue set aside until by a* careful examination Congress .
shall have brought to /light the exact relations of
railways to the business/' of the country arid made"
clear the way for providing a- remedy for such evils
as exist. ";)Â¦' v.- 'Â¦ Â¦Â¦'Â¦U TV "

Mr. Graves is afraid that "little tots" will see the
play and grow up thinking that their ancestors all
used all slaves the way John L. Sullivan uses
Uncle Tom on the stage! A very poor compliment
to the coming intelligence of Southern youth.
Yet Cable is outlawed from his native Louisiana
for his Creole tales, and his "Grandissimes" is
spurned as an incendiary book.
The most revered and respected divines of New
England were witch hunters and took an active part
in the murder of old women who had moles on their
chins and were disliked by their neighbors. No
blacker record of superstition and folly exists than
they made, though they shared it with vast numbers in
this country and Europe. Has any one. heard of their
descendants attempting to exclude it from history?
Has any "Yankee" proposed to legislate Longfel
low's "New England Tragedies" out of that section?
Because of its revelations of another New England
trait, does any committee threaten to lynch the read
ers of Hawthorne's "Scarlet Letter"? Does any
"Yankee" leave a theater in dudgeon because the
play portrays the Yankee capacity for bilking arid
sharp practice, for mean economy and less than hon
est thrift?
This is rather discouraging. It is the old spirit that
sought to. suppress abolition by murdering Lovejoy
and mauling Sumner and denying the mails to the
New York Tribune. It is Tillmanism. No people
has ever emerged into an atmosphere of greatness
and progress until it became willing to tolerate ex
aggeration" of its follies and even misrepresentation
of the extremes of its habit of life, its views of econo
mics, its moral obliquities and its sin;.
Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith a year agomadea savage
attack on the novel, and is followed now by Mr. John
Temple Graves, one of the editorial writers 'of the
Atlanta Journal and a lecturer of such repute that he
makes a profitable platform season every year in the
North: Mr. Graves is pleased with the plan of the
Daughters of the Confederacy to suppress : "Uncle
Tom's Cabin," both book and play, by legislation!
The profound feeling, indicated by , such incidents
was incapable of creation by a lachrymose fiction. It
had its radix in the profound nature of things. With a
strange kind of- philosophy the people of the South
are just now being roused to a high pitch of feeling
by the play of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," somewhat
bunglingly dramatized from the novel. . ' .
He was followed by Broderick of California, who
declared himself sprung from the loins of a race of
laborers, and thrilled the Senate by pointing to the
capitals of the pillars and pilasters of the chamber
carved by the hand of his own father, a working
stonemason."
In the debate- the flower of the South in the Sen
ate defended slavery because it enabled the existence
of a leisure class, that could devote itself to politics
and the science of â¢ government. . Certain tasks and
personal services were denounced as degrading to a
gentleman. It was then that Senator Dodge, a Dem
ocrat, said that listening to the debate he had unwill
ingly reached the conclusion that armed v strife be
tween the sections'could not be averted, that it must
come, because the discussion had revealed such di
verse views of life and honor as indicated an antagon
ism that was incapable of compromise. He called
his father, who was also a Senator from another
State and sat near him, to witness that he from his
youth up had rendered to others such services as the
Southerners denounced as degrading and unworthy
of a' gentleman, and- that fact, instead of degrading
him in the estimation of the hardy Northern people,
had raised him in their esteem and inspired his pro
motion in public life.
The spread of abolition in the North will rank in
history as. an economic movement, not thickly
veneered with sentiment. It was just such a move
ment as now resists the free admission of the products
of cheap or forced, or. servile labor from Cuba and
the Philippines. The great debate in the United
States Senate before secession, before Lincoln's elec
tion, while Buchanan was President and the Repub
lican party was only opposing extension of slavery
into the Territories, foreshadowed the convulsion
that came a few yea^rs later.
AS a "purpose novel" Mrs. Stowe's "Uncle
Tom's Cabin" long ago accomplished what
ever it was intended to, effect. There are
many intelligent people, who were active in the anti
slavery period that believe its influence on public
opinion in that age of agitation is overestimated. Per
secution does more to advance any cause than any
amount of lachrymal literature. The fictitious woes
of Uncle Tom, the hectic character of little Eva', the
swagger of Legree, had far less to do with the cul
tivation of opposition to slavery than denial of the
right' of petition, the murder of Lovejoy, the brutal
assault upon Sumner, the denial .of. the mails to
Northern newspapers, Toombs' hypothetical rollcall
of his slaves at the foot of Bunker Hill monument,
and characterization of Northern workmen as ."mud
Upon this showing it - seems the poll tax require
ment virtually'sweeps tHe black vote from: the State
and reduces the white vote to such, an extent, that
the number of voters- in the elections this fall will
hardly amount to much more, than, an ; oligarchy. It
will be seen, furthermore, that there was no need of a
'â¢grandfather clause" in the to eliminate
the colored; vote in 3 State where so many ' people
both white, and black are willing to;. lose the fran
chise rather than pay a poll: tax. Alabama having
now attained a voting population "small but select,"
it remains" to be. seen whether she' can' elect better
men to office, enact better laws and enforce them
with more firmness.
Â¦ Some of the , details of counties are interesting.
The correspondent says: ! "The highest percentages
of failure to pay were in ; Mobile and Baldwin, white
counties, while- the typical black county of 'Dallas
comes next with over 40, The average elimination
of white voters in the whole .State is- between
30 and 35 per cent of those in the poll tax age.
* * " * The elimination of the blacks under 45
years of age was almost complete. In Mobile the
percentage was'about 70, which was the' lowest in the
State. Ip no other county was it", as* low as' 80 per
cent, and the general average can "be put- somewhere
between go and 95.'! - '-,.........
and 45. years of age is 60 per cent of the /-whole.:
Most of the counties have now been "heard from, arid
the indifference seems to have been universal. The
white counties have been as. derelict as the black belt,'
and perhaps a little more so."

ground of cruelty. She alleges that her
husband frequently beats her and has
often threatened to kill her. They reside
at 393 Ninth street.
John Clark of South Dakota, who was
married to Agnes Clark in 1866, is suing
for divorce. - He alleges that his wife got
drunk and in the presence of a number of
friends smashed a watermelon on his
bead.
My wife, when I first met her at Highland

three or four weeks and then married her.
She treated me so that I wan compelled to leave

Wife.
I own nothing but a horse and cart and a few
sporting implements, such as a gun and fishing
outfit. I get a salary of $325 a month as an
officer "of the Hopkins Investment Company,
but as I owe $18,000 I have to pay a large sum
of Interest every month. I do not own any
property on Jackson street, Eddy street or Turk
street, and did not at the commencement of the
divorce proceedings. My wife obtained those
court orders by misrepresentation and she Is
harassing me continually.
The affidavit filed by Hopkins yesterday
is a plea of poverty and a cry against his
wife's fondness for legal battles. Hopkins
says: " j Â¦ ?
The case was ttnally submitted, though
not until Mrs. Hopkins had obtained an
order of court directing her husband to
give her $250 to defray the cost of the trial
and to pay her 1100 a month alimony. Mrs.
Hopkins also received $150 to enable her.
to obtain the depositions of a number of
witnesses who could not attend the trial
but who were familiar with the doings of
Hopkins.
Subsequently Judge Graham ordered
Mrs. Hopkins to return her husband $400
she received as counsel fees and costs of
depositions, as Hopkins proved that she
had not used the money for. the purposes
for which It was intended. . Mrs. Hop
kins did not obey the order, and more
trouble resulted. Hopkins then discon
tinued the payment of alimony, and his
wife instituted a suit to compel him to do
so.
Hopkins has been in court many times
since the Institution of a. suit for divorce
by Mrs. Hopkins in Alanieda County last
year. She charged him with treating her
cruelly. The case was ' transferred from
Alameda to this county and came up for
trial, before Judge Graham last October.
Owing to the prominent social position
occupied by Hopkins and his reputed
wealth the trial attracted great atten
tion. For several days Hopkins and. his
wife alternated on the witness stand, tell
ing merry tales of their life at Highland
Springs, where they first met and where
they went subsequently on a visit.
William F. Hopkins, in an affidavit fileC
in Judge Sloss' court yesterday, swore
that his wife, who is seeking an order of

maktng his life miserable by instituting
all sorts of legal proceedings against him.

Critical Audience Applauds Her Ren-
Speaks to Congregation on "Strangers
and Foreigners" of the Long
The Rev. Dr. Nieto delivered a lecture
last evening at the Congregation Sherlth
Israel on the subject of "Strangers and
Foreigners." In the course of his re
marks the doctor, showed the prejudice
that existed in years gone by toward the
"Stranger" and the "Foreigner," but in
those times the word "stranger" meant
something very different to what it stood
for to-day. It stood for something hos
tile, for a person who was unfriendly, not
that he was so, but being a "stranger"
and a "foreigner" unknown to the popu
lace, for in those days there was no
means of communication and persons of
different countries knew not' each other,
it was only natural that they would look
with doubt and suspicion upon the "for
eigner."
The Jew going from place to place,
country to country, arrived as a "strang
er"âa "foreigner"â and that was the
commencement of the doubt and the sus
picion with which he was regarded. Not
only the Jew. but all others who came
into the town unheralded and unknown
had to suffer the same stigmas and in
conveniences, doubts and discomforts and
charges and vilifications.

" The < Grand Jury sent a , communication
to Justices' Clerk Fredrick yesterday noti
fying him that . H. - W. Westerfeld has
been appointed as: expert for the inquisi
torial body to. expert the books and ac
counts of Â¦ the Justices' Clerk's ; office.
AVesterf eld , will begin his . duties ' next
Monday. ' -*"'Â¦'â¢ : '- ' ' Â¦" ;: ''- -Â¦ ".. '
Under these ( circumstances, -whether the
Mayor had or had not the power to make p.
temporary appointment, pending the action of
the Board . of Supervisors, * Mr. Frederick, in
my opinion, muBt be held, at the present time,
to be a de facto officer.
Supervisor Brandenstein said that
Judge Cook had told him that he did not
so decide, but had simply held that since
Â¦\Yindrow was hot de jure clerk and no
danger existing of a second payment of
the salary Qulnn's prayer for absolute
injunction must be denied.
Ruef replied that whatever explana
tions may have been made Judge Cook's
written decision did Â¦Â¦ hold that Fredrick
was de facto clerk. In this connection the
following sentence from Judge Cook's de
cision may -be quoted as throwing light
on the Question: '
Cook's Decision in Question.
There was a deep silence for a moment,
and then Justice of the Peace Dunn arose
and said: -, â¢Â¦'--?.- --â¢â¢! * .- * - Â¦-Â» < /.
"1 want to reply to the Mayor' b remarks
by characterizing that part referring to
domination by a political boss, as abso
lutely untrue so far as I am concerned
and an insult." â¢
That was the end of the incident. Once,
earlier In the session, Mayor Schmitz.had
referred with-teome bitterness to the mid
right meeting of the Justices as being
"not in the interests "of Justice.";
The Supervisors under Brandenstein's
load proceeded very cautiously in order
to remove Â¦ some of the complications.
First, they approved the Mayor's accept
ance of Williams' resignation. Then to
make assurance doubly sure they them
selves accepted his resignation.
Supervisor Eggers, who developed into
the especial- ana eager champion of the
Justices, moved that "Windrow's nomina
tion be approved. The motion was de
feated by the following vote, 5 ayo. '.3
13 noes: .
Ayesâ Alpers, Bent, Boxton, Eggers, Sander-
Bon. . â¢ - -
Noes â Booth, ' Brandensteln, Braunhart.
Comte. Connor. Curtia, D'Ancona, Loughery,
Lynch, McClellan, Payot, - Wilson, Wynn.
Supervisor "Wynn's resolution approving
the* appointment of Powel , Fredrick was
debated at length. Brandensteln objected
strenuously to such procedure. He said
tbat all lawyers practically and the
courts recognized the office to be a State
office and held that the Mayor had no
power to fill the vacancy. He contended
further that in any case, whether the
Mayor had the right to appoint or not,
there was no warrant either in the char
ter or, the code- for action by the Super
vieors'upon the Mayor's appointment.
In the course of the debate Abe Ruef
was given permission to address the
board and he made a brief argument In
support Of the contention that the Mayor
was -'acting .-within his power when he
filled the vacancy. He said Judge Cook
had recognized Fredrick as the de facto
clerk. '?m8!HSffiiM3&&2g$&!Â£
This unfortunate situation is not
due to any. action of mine. It is due
to the fact that there is too much poli
tics in the affairs of the municipality.
If I thought the Justices were acting
in good faith I would recognize theii
nomination, but I am convinced that
they were not, and that in meeting
at midnight and in a hotel, away
from their courtrooms or chambers,
and naming a man simply because he
belonged to a certain political organ
ization, they were not acting in good
faith, but were simply being domina
ted by a certain political boss.
The Mayor took occasion to express his
opinion of the attitude of the Justices,
and he , did. it in plain words and with
voice shaken by the strength of his feel
ings. . He said:
Dominated by Political Boss.
" The above resolution, adopted in special
meeting . yesterday, represents the final
results attained by the Supervisors in
their efforts to untangle the snarl in the
clerk's office of Â¦ the Justices' Court. The
Supervisors ,by : a j decisive vote rejected
the nomination of Joseph Windrow, pre
sented , by the Justices, and in conse
quence Windrow's claim to the office has
no longer a leg to stand on. The board
also ratified the Mayor's acceptance of
Ed "Williams' " resignation, j The resolution
given above was intended to express the
Koral support extended to the Mayor by
the I Supervisors without committing
themselves to a possibly Illegal course by
recognizing, the Mayor's right to fill the
vacancy. ' ' ,
The adoption of the resolution after two
hours' debate on various phases of the
question was a victory for the Mayor and
Clerk Fredrick, and was won pnly . after
a resolution confirming In direct teems
Fredrick's appointment was snowed under
by a large negative vote.
Eesolved, That while this board re
fuses to commit itself on the right of
the Mayor to appoint, we nevertheless
approve his action placing Mr. Fred
rick in this position pending action
by the proper legal authorities.
WHEBJEAS, The Mayor and Board
of Supervisors of this city and county
have accepted the resignation j of E
W. Williams, clerk of the Justicfts'
Court; and
Whereas, His Honor the Mayor, con
tending that he is the appointing
power,' has appointed Fowel Fredrick
to the position formerly held by Mr.
Williamsjvtherefore be it â¢

ture hold its meeting on the first and third

fourth Tuesdays of the month, as has
been the practice for a long. time. At the
last meeting of the members It 'was de
cided that the club will hold its usual
outing and picnic, but no date has been
set. It is proposed to bring the members
together by a series of entertainments
during the rowing season. The first of
these will take place In April. There will
be' boat races over a short course,^ indoor
exercises and music, the object: being 'to
bring the members to the clubhouse and
give them an opportunity to meet one an
other socially. J. .: . . . '

A. P." Rothkopf, who was recently ap
pointed rowing commissioner by President
w. B. Hinchman of the Pacific Association
of the Amateur Athletic Union, does not
see a good prospect for open regattas this
year. The El Campo course is not avail
able for rowing races, while the cove at
Tlburon is too much cumbered with- arks,
yachts and other craft during the summer
and does not afford a long enough course
for important regattas. , The suggestion
has often been made to establish a row
ing course on Oakland Creek, . from the
Alameda narrow-gauge mole up. the
estuary, but a course cannot - be estab
lished* there without the co-operation of
the railroad company. A suggestion was
once made that the lagoon behind Tib
uron, in which the yachts are laid up dur
ing the winter, should be dredged out and
floodgates put in at the drawbridge. Noth
ing ever came of this suggestion and now
there is much more . likelihood - that ; the
lagoon will be filled up than that it will
be. dredged out' The old Long* 'Wharf
course, which has been the scene of; bo
many aquatic events, has been rendered
unavailable by the march of improve
ment In that . part of the . city. ? The only,
sheet of water within reasonable ' distance
of San â¢ Francisco is Lake Merrltt, Â¦ on
which the Oakland people gave a success
ful regatta last ' year. '- It ' Is probable a
similar event will be given this year, and
that '- the championships < in :.'. the . various
classes will" be decided 'Â¦ at that' regatta-
The experience gained by the managers
last year will enable them to Â» make sev
eral improvements,- such as providing bet
ter dressing-rooms and accommodations
for launching their boats for.the oarsmen
and starting the events more punctually..
â¢ A barge crew of the Olympic Boat Club
was out on the bay, last Sunday,, and get
ting caught in. the storm, had i a: rough
time. The men were . at , last rescued â¢ by
one of McNeil's -launches, which ; put out
to their aid from Tiburon. ' Â¦;
The members of the, California Tennis
Club will hold the first Important tourna
ment of the year to-day on their courts.
It will be a straight handicap singles open
to the members of the club only. It was
the original intention of the tournament
committee -to hold an open class singles,
but as those In favor of the latter were
in the minority the committee decided to
make it a handicap event. In an affair
of this kind the chances of the poorer
players are much better than in a class
event
The last tournament held on the club
courts was a straight handicap singles,
and It seems unfair to the better players
to have a similar event without a clasB
or scratch, tournament between. The
poorer players are more numerous than
the cracks, but the latter are entitled to
more consideration than. the former and
should not be expected to go - through
every tournament saddled with a heavy
handicap. Aside from this the class tour
nament is more interesting to both
players and spectators than a handicap.
In the former some good matches are
brought out in the classes, while in the
latter a first class man allowing a fourth
class man odds of "half forty" could
hardly be called a good match or an in
teresting one.
It Is doubtful if the Whitney brothers
will take part. Should they not Collier
and Grant Smith will be the scratch men.
An effort is being made to get some of
the former champions to enter, but out
side of Gus Taylor It is not thought that
any will take part. The clubmen are de
sirous of having Tom Drlscoll enter, as
many are of the opinion he could beat
any of the first class men.
The following have already entered:
Collier, H. W. Crowell, J. D. Mac-
Gavin, Fred Brown, Merle Johnson, Sher
wood Adams, Grant Smith, Chet Smith,
Frank Stringham, Harry Haight. Will
Allen, Lieutenant Kempff, Ray Cornell,

B. G. and L. . O. Wood, A. . Beyfuss, A.
Ames, W. Morton, Dr. Lane, I* Cutler
and Dr. Noble. Many, more en tries, are
expected this morning. Prizes will be
presented - to . the four Â¦ players Â¦ reaching
the semi-finals. If possible the tournament
will be completed to the semi-flnal round
to-day. The semi-flnal and finals will be
played to-morrow.
There will also be a large tournament
in Oakland to-day. The Coquelcot Tennis
Club, recently reorganized, will hold Its
initial tournament of class singles. The
Alameda Tennis Clubmen also intended

At theydrst meeting of the new.board of
directors of the Corinthian Yacht, Club
Charles L. Barrett was chosen treasurer
and J. C. Brickell secretary. George W.
Harrold was appointed to the office of
measurer. - It was decided that a meeting
of - yacht owners ,be held in the Mer
chants' Exchange on Friday evening, the
2Sth. inst., to prepare the schedule of
cruises for the. coming season.
The drawbridge into the lagoon will
probably â¢ be raised qh Sunday, March 23,
the only other day in , next month on
which \ there is a favorable tide being
March 9, which is too early for tho
yachtsmen. . The -yacht owners will also
select, the opening day of the season,
which will almost certainly be Saturday,
April' 19, .the first cruise being taken on
Sunday, April 20. A. committee has been
appointed to prepare and take charge of
the Jinks â¢ to be given at the clubhouse
on the evening of Saturday, April 19. It
consists of â¢ J.- V. O'Brien, Frank W.
Thompson, W. ; C. Howe, E. J. Bowes,
Walter Crowell and L. Harris.
The directors have . determined to call a
special meeting, of members to reconsider
the assessment which the members at the
recent annual meeting, declared them
selves in favor of levying in order to meet
the increased expenditure of the club. It
is probable it will be decided to set aside
the assessment, and in -lieu thereof to
amend the by-laws of the club and make
the annual dues J15, instead of $12, as here
tofore. If the amendment is passed It will
become operative on the . 1st . of April of
this year. The opinion is generally enter
tained that" the dues of the Corinthian
Club are quite low when the number of
entertainments provided is considered.
and that the slight proposed increase of
dues will meet with no opposition. As-"
sessments are always unpopular, and the
remedy of the directors if a member re
fuses to pay an assessment Is. not quite
clear. The Increased income to arise from
the larger Â¦ dues will :. not be received in
time to help the directors In meeting the
expenses of opening' day, but these can
doubtless be provided for. '-- - â¢
The California Yacht ; Club â¢ has a com
mittee out working on its "annual" for
1902, which will bring the history , of the
club down to date, will. supply a chrono
logical list of the members in the order in
which their names stand on the roll, a list
of^the yachts, their owners and measure
ments, and much other useful matter. Â»' *
Ex-Governor George W. Baxter of Mon
terey Is in the city and has had a confer
ence with the secretary of the -San Fran

possibility of a cruise to Monterey during
the summer. â¢ The Governor expressed his
desire to offer a cur. as a prize for a
yacht race in -Monterey Bay* The yachts

themselves almost- exclusively, to bay sail-
Ing, and- there, is little-probability -that
more 'than two or, three owners could be
persuaded . to .take , their, boats out on a
cruise as far as Monterey.
The ,.' South . Bay yachtsmen propose to
have a barbecue at Alviso early in April
to be followed by, an illumination of the
club yachts and a - dance. This entertain
ment will be followed by others,: the ob
ject being tq= raise $2000 with which to
build . a clubhouse â¢ at Alviso. The fleet
consists of seventeen boats, while two
more are being built. Commodore H A.

Club's Important meetings of the year
â¢will be held to-day and to-morrow at
Union Park. The card embraces the Belle
Brandon cup stake and the California
plate. . -;v-:
The former Is for greyhounds whelped
last year, and has attracted all the great
young dogs in training. The only notable
absentee will be George MacE. Malcolm's
Matters Much. In trials this young miss
proved in a class by herself and was
thought to hold everything In the stake
safe. Unfortunately she was taken down
with distemper some days since and had
to be withdrawn.
George JCethercott's Pocotala and D. J.
Healey's John McKenna meet In the first
round, and the winner is expected . to
Â¦work his way well Into the stake. All
the entries from these kennels have been
given plenty of practice after hares. W.

perience. . . * : v Â¦'
In order to prevent the young grey
hounds getting too much running a relief
dog will be liberated at the end of one

to-day, leaving four dogs in for to-mor
row.
The California plate, for the all-age
division, will be run down oneÂ© to-da/.

meet to-morrow In a consolation stake.
With the exception of Palo Alto and Sac
ramento Boy, all the crack greyhounds
cf the coast are entered. The owner of
Sacramento Boy was not a member of
the Interstate Club. The rules were sus
pended Justvbefore the draw and he was
elected. In the hurry incidental to the
draw bis dog's name was not entered on
the list and was thus out of the stake.
There will be trains to the park to-day
at 10:15 a. m. and 1 p. m. There will be
music by Blum's orchestra.

ing man, will be renewing acquaintances
at the park to-day. â¢â¢Â» -^

Judge Troutt, In deciding that Mra.
Ryan waa sane, did not take Into consid
eration the testimony offered by the wit
nesses summoned by Mrs. Pettee's or
H rs - attorneys. He said that in
his opinion the mere fact that the doctor-
In charge of the hospital for the insane
at Napa had discharged her aa sane waa
enough to convince him that the woman
waa capable of managing her own affairs.
The restoration to competency of Mrs.
Ryan was opposed by Mrs. Pettee, who
declared that the woman was a heavy
drinker and not capable of taking care of
her estate, which consists of a few per
sonal adornments and a monthly remit
ta "co received from, relatives in England.
jr, M^ S - ? y K. n w^, ote to Judge Tiroutt and
inlormed him that she wished to be re
stored to capacity because Mrs. Pettee
was interfering with her affairs and at
tempting to direct her in matters which
Mrs. Ryan said she felt capable of per
rormlng with as good judgment as her
guardian. To settle the qusetion of com
petency Judge Troutt requested th*>
woman s attorney, J. L. Copeland, to pe
tition the court to restore his client to
capacity.
This was done, and with the petition aa
objection to Mrs. Pettee's account aa
guardian was also filed. The account of
Airs. Pettee shows that she received 480
from Mrs. Ryan's relatives during the
months of August and September of last
year and $5 50 from the United Service
Society. ..The account shows that she paid
out $106 40. Judge Troutt refused to ap
prove the account without Investigation.
Mrs. Ryan has one child, a son, who fs
16 years of age. When his mother was
declared insane he asked the court to
appoint S. L. Morris, a friend of his
mother, as guardian. Morris accordingly
petitioned for letters of guardianship, but
they were refused him.
Mrs. Catherine Ryan, who was released
from the Napa Insane Asylum last De
cember, was restored to competency yes
terday by Judge Troutt, and the letters
of guardianship over her person and es
tate issued to Mrs. John Pettee last July.
when Mrs. Ryan, who is also known as
Mrs. Hartridge, was declared Insane,
were revoked.-

to the people of Sonoma and Men
docino counties. Rain does not di
minish the attendance at the Citrus
Fair, and this year's exposition of the or-
chard wealth of this section gives prom
ise of being a record-breaker in all re
spects.

lengths. The latter, beat the â¢â¢ barrier. ; Co
lonial Girl appears to have gone 'back
some, for she gained little in the run
home, finishing 'third. '.^
O'Connor also piloted Siddons past the
judges winner of the | closing - mile r and a
sixteenth run. As usual, the Wadsworth
horse fell out of it at the start, then, fin
ishing with a. rush, downed ,- Sea Lion
nearly two length. Hungarian was a close

Botany waa no. match for Sombrero in
the seven-furlong purse run... The Morris
colt ruled a 3 to 5 favorite, and, catching
Botany at the paddock, won from there
on as he pleased. Josle G displayed some
early speed, but retired from the firing
line early, losing- the short end of the
purse to Dunblane.;; Lee Jackson piloted
the winner. - . ; ..â -
Johnny Daly rode a well-judged race on
Bassenzo in the seven-furlong run, reach
ing the wire less than a length- before
Urchin. The .winner closed a 2 to ,1 fa
vorite, but had a stronger lad than little
Redfern been on- the back of Urchin,' the
positions might have been reversed. . Kill
doe took the show. '
Walter Jennings' black filly,' Nlgrette,
won the two-year-old dash in game
fashion, after at one time looking beaten.
She closed an 11 to 20 choice, with O'Con
nor up, and at the wire downed Delsegno,
a 50 to 1 shot, cleverly. Tom Mitchell fin
ished third.

Bragg and Redwald. The crack mudlark

been pburing down in. torrents since early
morning and the streets, were flooded with
water, a large audience 'gathered' in the
Assembly Hall to-night to" witness .the
production of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic
opera, "The Pirates of Â» Penzance," which
was given by Â¦; local /'talent under the
auspices of the Associated -(Students.^
A-- Both the singing arid-acting of theama
teurs were excellent,, particularly that of
Dr. George B. Ldttle.-who played the part
of the pirate apprentice; and Mrs. Perry
Roberts, whoappeared as Mabel Stanley. 1
The full chorus of fifty voices showed the
fine training that had been given it under,
the direction of Louis W. Weer, the di
rector. The music for the opera was sup
plied by the student orchestra under the
leadership of L. J. Wertheimer and was
a pleasing feature of the evening. .

Coffee-Drinkers Require Proof.
When persons insist on taking some
kind of food or drink that causes disease
It 1* not fair to blame a doctor for not
curing them.
CoSee keeps thousands of people sick in
cpite of all the doctor can do to cure
them. There Is but one way to get well.
That is to quit coffee absolutely; a great
help will be to shift over to Postum
Food Coffee.
A case of this kind Is Illustrated by
Mrs. E. Kelly, 233 Eighth avenue, Newark,
K J., who eays: "I have been ailing* for
about eight years with bilious trouble and
Indigestion. Every doctor told me to glvo
up coffee. I laughed at the idea of coffee
hurting me, until about three years ago
I was taken very bad and had to have a
doctor attend me regularly.
"The doctor refused to let me have cof-
fee, but prescribed Postum Food Coffee.
I eoon got to making it so well thaf I
could not tell the difference in tasto be-
tween Postum and the common coffee. .
"I began to Improve right away and
have never had a bilious spell since giving
up coffee and taking- on Postum. "When I
started I weighed 109 pounds; now I
Â¦weigh 130. My friends ask what has made
the change, and, of course, I tell them
it was leaving off coffee and taking up
Postum.
"I know husband will never go back to
the old-fashioned coffee again. You can
use my name if you print this letter, for
I am not ashamed to have the public"
know Just what I have to say about Pos-
tum and what It has done for me.".1tHR(DWNFROM HIS HORSEâ W.J. Scott,';

SUSTAINS THE MAYOR
Your letter of January 13 is to hand and
I have carefully noted Its contents. It seems
to me that I have known you -for a Ion? time,
as I can readily imagine what you must havs
gone through with that Mme. Harbidge. alias
Jones, alias Brady, alias Friemann. alias Maris
tany. I do not feel any compunction In giv
ing you her whole history, at least as mucii
; as I know, for I may tell you that It did not
take me long to see through her game and
I dropped her In Honolulu like a hot potato.
and I. have ever since been trying to forget tlie
worst mistake of my life. I met her In Port
land, Or., in 1893. I was in business and
doing well. I certainly went through a form
of marriage with her. but not until after
that did I learn from some of my friends
that she had been married twice previously.
You make the fifth, and goodness knows how
many more she had. She got me Into debt to
the extenj of $4000, for .which I could not pay
a cent. She wanted to be a soctety lady and
give balls and dances, but thÂ« people saw
through her, so everybody dropped her.
Lots . of people in California and Oregon
know . me. and I am willing to write to any
of them to show that I am the Friemann that
Mme. Harbldge gave out as dead. She knew
that I was alive and where I resided all the
time. Upon being exposed la the Alameda
courts she at once came to London and tried
to square me to lay low-Â«-as she- called It â
and not to show up. She said that she had
a- $30,000 case in the courts, and if she could
prove that I was not , alive she would surety
win - It. I immediately set the. law In motion
here and she disappeared" as Â¦ if by magic. - ~
I am- very sorry for you. and readily under
stand the position you must be in and how
you must teel it. particularly a man of your

DIVOBCED WIEE GETS
THE DEATH BENEFIT
Supreme Court Decides That Money
Can Only Be Paid to the Beno^- ; v ?
flciary Named.
The Supreme Court yesterday in award
ing- a death benefit' to the divorced wlfa
of G. M. V. Courtols rendered a decision
of interest -to those connected with bene
ficiary orders. Â¦ â¢ â¢ -..
-. Courtois was a member of the 'Ancient
Order of United Workmen and carried a
death benefit certificate of $2000. He made
this sum payable to his wife, Emilie. La
ter he secured a divorce and remarried.
He neglected to change the name, of th<a"
beneficiary of the certificate and when he
died both of the women claimed the $2000.
The lower court decided that the last wife
was entitled to the money, but that de
cision is reversed by the Supreme Court.
It is held that on account of Courtot3\
neglect the order has no alternative but
to pay the benefit to the person named
in the certificate, even though it be a
divorced wife. The first wife had re
sumed her 'maiden name of Emilte Eti
enne^ The contest has been in the court*
for many months. ,

orate functions ever given by that
organization. It was a truly Native Son
social, given in Native Sons' Hall, in
which the parlor has a large proprietary
interest. The decorations were "the han
diwork of A. F. Schleicheri vice president
of the parlor; the music was by Ronco
vierl, another Native Son, and the print
ing was done by still another member of
the order.
; The decorations were all white, most
artistically festooned and relieved g from
heaviness by ferns and great bells of nile
green material, the whole being illumi
nated by concealed electric lights. The
orchestra was hidden by ' a pretty ar
rangement of tall Spotted plants.
'It 'was a full dress affair and the mem
bers of the -several, committees wore* in-'
stead of the usual badges moire antique
sashes across the breast after the manner
of Marshal of France. In the grand

money had been' intrusted to him as chief
clerk and that he unlawfully embezzled
and converted It to his own use and the
third charging that as clerk he assumed

turned the fire. Officer i Shinkwin, who
was In the vicinity, says â¢ that- but two
shots were fired; and that he saw no one
running away. The clothing on Higgins'
left leg, where the bullet entered, is

about $30,000, which she Induced the aged
Maristany to deed to her subsequent to

Exchahge and Bullion
NEW TORK, Feb. .21. â The action of the
stock market this morning: demonstrated pretty
cÂ«iclu6i\-ely that epeculative sentiment had
cv^f-ome the ehock caused by yesterday's un-
SJ|Kte4 announcement of the proceedings
)A*a!:ist the Northern Securities Company
Stocks held on msrgrin and by timid holders had
apparently beea cold out yesterday and with
forced liquidation completed there was very
little need for supporting orders In the mar
ket this morning. It was generally suppOfced
that fitocks bought yesterday for support had
been unloaded on the rally as Insiders galnet"
oonfldt-nce thst no serious break In prices waa
impending-. At the opening the market was
heavy, but by the second hour the selling had
.'.:;:â¢ n to sucb small proportions that the mar
ket was practically stagnant. At the same
litre there were points of resletance and a few
stocks rained additional strength as the day
;..-cf.rcfspd and led a substantial rally, which
r'.scM prices quite generally above last nlght'h
clc*Â«. The issuance of the bank statement
Â«Â»m*d to be the turning point. The each
Item was practically unchanged. Instead of the
expected decrease of over a million dollars, and
thf restriction of the loan expansion to ltÂ«Â«
than rr.,000.000 reassured the uneasy senti
ment that credit resources were being taken
up at too headlong a pace. The call money
rtte eeeed off to 2 per cent under Uve show
inr of the bank Ktat*roent and the reduced re
quirement* for speculative purposes. The
cessation of forced liquidation and the develop
ment of rtirngth In s number of stocks drove
the shorts to cover. A report that J, P. Mor
gan had gone to Washington to confer with
**r*slaent Roosevelt gave room traders corn
ton. The Colorado and Southern stocks bÂ«

though receipts were the heaviest, thus far this

still another car is wanted for the East, and

Prospects are most -encouraging' as to the

3.5 per cent from last; year's figures, which is

Harrison's circular says: "During- the week
there hava been six coal arrivals from Wash
ington with. 21,000 tons; two from Oregon, 113O
tons; three from British Columbia. 922.8 tons;
total, 31,848 tons. ThÂ« deliveries from British
Columbia have been very light this month.,
and the shrinkage In shipments has been seri
ously felt In tho market, especially during the
cold -weather this month, wnen a. number of
Jobbers and retailers did not have & single
ton of Wellington coat on hand. Some outside
grades of Colonial 1 have been brought Into
requisition, which were never before utilized
for domestic purposes. There is an abundance
of steam fuel on hand, which is being disposed
of at very low figures, having- oil as a com
petitor, the sales of which are - increasing
monthly, and at slightly Improved prices.
Freight rates on coal from England and Aus
tralia have touched bed rock; when shippers
will not pay over 10s or 11s per ton it Is ap
proximating ballast figures. Ship-owners re-'
celve no compensation for th* use of their
vessels at $2 CO per ton. when, they deduct cost
of loading and discharging-, and the extra time
saved by sending ships In ballast. Besides oat
ward grain freights are sliding downward,
which should have a tendency to strengthen
foreign coal rates, hence the writer feels as
sured that better rates must prevail In the
near future."

' Specially good reports come from, the job
bers ot the West and Northwest, but it is to
be notttf that Eastern, dry goods dealers have
booked a large business, limited only on cot
ton goods by the unwillingness of sellers to
commit. themselves heavily, even at the present
advanced prices. Spot cotton is again stronger,

continues.
weather conditions have ruled
throughout a large area, with the natural
effect of checking mercantile operations, and
hampering the movement of general merchan
dise and of the products of industry. Coun
try, produce, particularly eggs, butter and
cheese, have continued their upward flight, the
highest prices for three years being reached in
the first named, while the cereals have remained
quite steady, due largely to better export in
quiry for wheat, offsetting the natural growth
of bearlehness induced by the .culmination of
the late rise.

Condition of the Treasury.
The flotation of the Northern Securities Com
pany might be defeated, without threatening
the renewal 'of the transcontinental railroad
conflict. The cause for depression which some
discern In the proceedings against the North
ern Securities Company lies in the supposition
that Jt ia -intended to test the efficacy of the
existing law and then lend the power of the
administration to amending it If necessary to
make It effective against the formation of
great financial combinations. The programme
thus foreshadowed would not be regarded with
equanimity by any large financial interest, and
a reflection of misgiving would be expected in
the securities market for an indefinite period.
The routine newe of the week has given no
cause for anxiety, but rather for encourage
ment in the activity of the Iron trade, a rather
larger movement of grain and prosperous gen
eral trade Â¦ conditions.
The bond market has been relatively more
active than stocks and values were only slight
ly affected by the late weakness in stocks, out
side of some of the highly speculative issues.

The announced determination of the authori
ties at Washington to take legal steps against
the Northern Securities Company on the ground
that it was formed in violation of the Sher
man anti-trust law of 1890 upset the stock
market on Thursday and superseded every
other consideration. Previous to that time
there had been a dull and spotty market.' with
Individual stocks advancing sharply and the
general undertone firm. Tnie was due to the
disinclination of holders to sell as much as
to any marked demand for stockE. How far
the new turn of affairs in Northern Securities
may ultimately affect the market is difficult
to foresee. Those whose substantial Interests
are most at etake were large buyers of stocks
. tn the flurry of Thursday, while the sellers
were almost wholly the speculators on mar
gin, some of them of important character. It
Is invariably the rule, however, that substan
tial Interests came- to the support of values of
properties in which they are interested in time
of crises, without any purpose of obtaining
stocks for permanent holding. The same thing
was seen at the time of President McKInley's
assassination and in last May'e panic. The
assumption among speculators in Wall street
that the establishment of the status of the
Northern Securities Company would remove all
the repressive influences on speculation and
restore conditions to the state that was Inter
rupted by the Northern Pacific quarrel, takes
no account of the fact that values were in
flated by overspeculatlon last May and that
the events that the then speculation was in
tended to discount have since come to pass,
or have been demonstrated to be Idle rumors
and canards. Not much thought has been
given as to how far the actual condition of
property values would be affected by the over
throw of the Northern Securities Company. It
is not clear that the actual changes and divi
sion of control which were effected by the
Northern Pacific contest would be altered by
dissolving- the company. . .

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO, -Feb. '21.â WHEAT- Conditions
were little changed. Foreign news . was "slight
ly bullish and domestic ''Â¦ the reverse. Closing
up deals started the market a trifle lower, but
so | tame | was speculation that * fluctuations , the.
first ' part of , the session .were hardly notice
able; \ There .was little interest j in the . market
arid'thelpit was almost -without 'feature. The
prevailing sentiment was to sell- for a
moderate -break, but., the experience of Â» short
sellers in both corn' and wheat for the last few
days held the feeling in check to : some extent.
Eventually the " Southwestern ' markets - began
to turn j weak,; the - corn market was affected
bearlshly and' wheat' turned -the . scale ' and
slipped downward. , When the bearish feeling
was well Â¦ manifested in wheat bulls had a
pretty hard time of it supporting the marltet.
May,' which opened a shade higher to *4@UÂ°
lower at 78%c to 78c. haggled for a long
time, then declined to 77%c and closed weak,
%c lower at 77%@77%c. - -
There was more interest to-day in corn.
Bearish news was in the majority and senti
ment was - nearly all on the selling side. ' Corn
fought the declines stubbornly, however, in a
way to puzzle the trade. May closed weak,
%@?ic lower at 60-Jic. >"; .
Oats were dull and uninteresting. May
closed weak. %c down, at 43V&C.
-Provisions had. a good tone, but fluctuations
were very narrow. May pork closed 5c higher,
lard .unchanged, and ribs 2%c up.
-The leading futures ranged as follows: â¢ â¢Â¦ .
COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL
Chicago Grain Market.
?>w York for the five days ending February 21
reflects a moderate . expansion : in loans and de
posits, with a corresponding decrease in surplus
reserves. The loan item increased only $4,752,
900., This, coming after several weeks of enor
mous inflation, indicates what appears to be a
culmination of ' the /heavy borrowing at this
center, although as a matter of fact the banks
are not in a position I to extend their commit
ments much further ' Jn this direction. Total
loans are now nearly . $!W", 000,000, ;,. a ' figure
never Â¦ before .- reached ' in the- history â¢ or the
Clearing-house. . Deposits, which "rose $4,195,
200 during the week, are al3o at a maximum
figure of $1,019,474,200. v This deposit-total calls
for a legal cash reserve of $254,86S,650, and fts
the total cash reported by the banks Is $267.
325,200, the excess is $12,456,650, or $1,104,200
less than a week ago. One year ago. when the
totals ot the banks were approaching the high
est mark known at that time, the surplus.re
serve was nearly the. same as. now, yet it de
clined over the spring months, despite the fact
that: deposits were reduced heavily. The' fea
ture of the current week was the reversal of
the movement, local banks reporting
a loss instead, of a gain, as had been the case
for some time. The money went for the most
part to near-by I cities, probably to - strengthen
the position of the banks receiving it. pending
the official call of the Comptroller, for state
ments." Another feature of interest at this
.time Is the ruling strong prices for exchange,
indicating a'movement of gold from New York
early next week. ., It wiir.be.- conceded that,
with average reserves of about 1 per cent above
the legal minimum," with deposits at their'maxi
mum and with probable demands upon the cash
now in hand, the banks are not. likely, to rollow
a policy which will still further , encroach on
their present surplus holdings of cash.' > -

Fuhrman's allegations were borne out

He described how Mrs. Daniels lived in the

â¢with Mrs. Tanner his client had made
a will in which Mrs. Halpin and Mrs.
Tanner were devisees.
'â¢She suftered a stroke of paralysis in
October of last year," said Fuhrman.
"and from that time until she was re
moved to the hospital she was not treat
ed right by the two women. One day she
tore up the will she had made and from
that, day she has been made to appear as

URGES ACTION
ON GAS RATES
Asks Supervisors to Com

Sends Third Communication Looking
to Prevention of Accidents by
\ Keeping Rear Platforms of
Street Cars Clear.
The Grand Jury took action yesterday
on three matters of great importance to
the Â¦ people of â¢ San Francisco. Communi
cations to. the Board of Supervisors were
prepared, urging that . ordinances be "'en
acted compelling uniform gas rates/regu
lating telephone .service, requiring
that the .; rear platform of street Â¦ cars be
kept clear of passengers. .
These communications will be presented
at once and early action by- the legislative
body of the municipality is expected.- In
fact, the ordinances which the grand
jurors. had in view have already been
framed. and ; in response to the Initiative
of the Grand Jury they will be introduced
at the regular meeting of the Supervisors
Monday, r It is t believed that a majority of
the Supervisors favor legislation along
the lines suggested in the communications
and that the proposed ordinances' will
meet with very general popular support
and will â¢ be advanced toward final pass
age as rapidly as the requirements of law
will permit. .-'.. .
Uniform Gas Rates Demanded.
The first and most important of the
Grand Jury's communications deals with
the problem of uniform gas rates. It
urges that an ordinance be enacted that
will remove the advantage now possessed
by consumers of gas in downtown dis
tricts and In : other sections where the
force of competition is felt, over consum
ers who are so unfortunate as to be. lo
cated in a district where gas monopoly
holds undisputed sway.'
The proposed ordinance will require
that the lowest rate for gas given to any
consumer must become the general rate
and under its operation it will no longer
be possible for a gas company to charge
fifty cents per thousand on one side of a
street, where, the mains of a competing
company are also laid, and $1 35 per thou
sand; on the., other side, of ' the street,
where it happens to have absolute controi
of the situation. There is also involved
the more important, economic principle
that the public welfare demands that the
residents of- outlying districts be placed
on an equality with those of sections
more nearly adjacent N to the source S of
supply in regard to public or quasi-public
utilities. 'Â¦â¢';. 'Â¦'Â¦ Â¦".}
The present situation as to gas rates
has been very vexatious to consumers,
and the unlucky householders who have
been forced to pay monthly ga3 bills at
the rate of $1 35 per thousand, the max
imum rate permitted, with' the full knowl
edge that In districts where the cost of
delivery is not Â¦ one whit " less consumers
have, had, the advantage of a. 50-cent.rate
simply because V the mains of competing
companies are, laid there, have not been
disposed, to rest quietly. under the burden.
The consequent agitation of the- question
has ; resulted " in 'Â¦Â¦ the Â¦ initiative that was
taken by the r Grand Jury . yesterday,
which promises' to lead to legislation that
will speedily â¢ afford relief from present
conditions.- Â¦ ' â¢ . : Â¦ .
Switch First; Then the Nickel.
' The, second communication relates to a
matter almost as vexatious and equally
trying" to* the temper if not, to the, purses
of the people. ' \The grand Jurors urge
that the Supervisors enact an ordinance
that; will, compel telephone companies to
furnish value received to the patrons of
nickel-ln-the-slot.- telephones. : They con
sider that no hardship will be inflicted 'on
the corporation if it be required first to
get ; the .switch and . then , demand the
nickel of the waiting patron.- If the pro
posed ordinance be enacted dropping- a
nickel into the Insatiable slot and being
informed that "they don't | answer", will
be a thing of . the â¢ past and â¢tempers and
purses' will be, spared a' tax that is most
odious. : .'. 'Â¦â¢Â¦.'. . '*. '. , . '
The contention of the telephone . com
panies that if the switch is first made
and the drop-a-nlckel demand made after*
ward the patron may refuse' to pay is not
regarded as valid by - the grand jurors.
They hold that the telephone operators
may ; easily - and .without "confusion pre
vent conversation until the nickel has
been . dropped even - though response has
first been had from the other end of the
line. 'It is also urged that party lines
be limited to / six 'subscribers;, to obviate'
the present abominable ' service and fveiE
atious conditions where ten ! subscribers'
are: grouped on one line.
Bear; Platform to Be dear.
The lamentable accident that led to the
death. of ,R/ B. Milroyj late secretary. of
the Calif ornia : Jockey " Club, Inspired the
Grand ; Jury's ' : , third communication. ;; It
calls attention to the .danger to < patrons
of the street railway -companies arising
from the crowding of the rear platforms
of cars. ; : Mr. Â¦ Milroy attempted to board
a car. In front of the Palace Hotel. Ordi
narily he .would have succeeded with-per
fect safety/but on this occasion the plat
form t was - crowded and being unable to
get a . footing Mr. Milroy was thrown to
the ground and fatal Injuries Inflicted.
; If. the ordinance framed ; ; In ' accordance
with .the ''- Grand Jury's suggestion be
enacted the conductor of a car will be re
quired to keep the rear platform entirely
