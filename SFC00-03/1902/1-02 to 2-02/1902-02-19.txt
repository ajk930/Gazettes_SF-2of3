The evidence was but- a repetition of
facts presented during the last eight days
through the columns of the daily press.
There were a few minor details that came
to light for the first time, but they were
unimportant and gave absolutely no clew
as to the, identity of the man C. B.
Hawkins, alias John Bennett.
The office of the Coroner was too small
to accommodate the crowd that desired
to listen to the evidence In the case that
has thrilled the city and State. The
small space of the room barely sufficed to
furnish seats to those whose official duty
required their presence.
As in all cases of mystery, men and
women were present whose love , of the
morbid and notoriety furnished the sole
excuse for listening to the evidence. Old
men and callow youths, wizened women'
and young girls, thronged to the Cor
oner's office to listen to the ghastly de
tails of the death of Nora Fuller." J ',.

Hearing Will
Continue To-
Mr. McKinney of Santa Cruz County
is an owner of timber lands in the Big
Basin. In fact he owns, to particularize,
half of a section that is near the west
fork of Warfdell Creek, which Is the
fork upon which the Park Commission
ers count for a water supply principally.
Mr. McKinney has a daughter," Miss
Pearl McKinney, and through her the
discovery of the gTeat amount of Govern
ment lands that has hitherto been so ef
fectually hidden from the eyes of the j
public has been made.
Some time ag-o, in. fact Just about the
time the Big Basin Park . Commissioners
became an active body. Miss .McKinney
took preliminary steps toward securing
the other hclf of the section that her
father owns near the west fork 'of the
Waddell, the homestead act being her
vehicle. If she had successfully perfect
ed her title in that way she would ' have
not only have secured Big Basin ' lands
at $2 Ui per acre, but she also would have
come into the ownership, of one mile of
the bed of the west fork of< the Waddell
Creek, which runs, as nearly as -may be
estimated by the maps In the San Fran
cisco Land Office, through just about
the center of the land she desired.
Inquiry Is Instituted.
Knowledge of this came in due time to
the Big Basin Park Commissioners. Gov
ernor Gage and his associates on tbe
commission then took pains to Inquire dl-"
recUy into the ownerehlp of all the tracts
besides the one that formed the basis of
Miss McKinney'B operation, that were,
concealed from locators by -the"

Control of Creek.
When the public and the Park Com
sioners began to investigate into the ca
pacity of the Big Basin as a public park
it. became apparent that unless Waddell
Creek could be under the control of the
State the value of the park might be
very little, for it is impossible to imagine
an adequate public park, to be used by
campers, that has not sufficient and a re
liable supply of water, which is the first
requisite.
the representation being made by the
promoters that the ground could be pro
cured at a reasonable figure. The Big Ba
fcin Lumber Company, which has ac
quired the lands that are now offered to
the State at $100 per acre, was Incor
porated April 24, 1900. Just one vreek
later the Sempcrvirens Club was started.
The latter at once began and has since
carried on the â¢ agitation for park
principally. It set forth in Its literature
that the land could be bought at $50 per
acre as the highest price. The club has
recently held a convention at San Jose
a::d declared that the price ought to be
$190 *>er acre. '.
pin is of common knowledge, yet a few
facts will be recapitulated here to fur
nish an understanding of what follows.
The State appropriated $250,000 for the
purchase of a park tract. The law that
authorized this appropriation was pro
cured by agitation at Sacramento and
through the columns of daily newspapers.
An astonishing discovery has been made
in connection with the lands in the re
gion known as the Big Basin, In Santa
Cruz County. For some reason, which
may possibly be explained by the officials
of Santa Cruz, more than 1400 acres In th~e
Basin and on the ridges forming its rim
that belong to the Government have, for
Eome years, been assessed to "unknown
owners." No steps have been taken to
have the lands sold for non-payment of
taxes to the State. This may imply that
?qjnÂ© one who was concerned in Santa
Cruz official life knew all about the real
ownership of the property and was con
cerned in withholding the knowledge from
the general public that such lands were
to be had for the homesteading. While
the assessment read to "unknown owners"
only the Initiated could benefit.
Santa Cruz County's .Assessor has been
paid a. salary to_make __a Â» -rrect assess-.
rnent of the property in the county for
the purpose of taxation. What he has
officially failed to find out has been
known by private parties, and out of that
fact grows a story of considerable inter
est to the public.
The controversy that has arisen over
the price to be paid by the State for
lands for park purposes in the Big Ba-
man under arrest-
Antoine Anderson, .whose name was
mentioned In some of the letters found in
the room of*Arin!e Anderson, reported
early yesterday morning to Captain of
Detectives Seymour. The police listened
to and verified later the statements that
he made.
Conrad Oleaon, the wounded girl's half
brother, and Anderson disagreed at one
time. Anderson was an -occasional caller
on the woman. who was shot, but the po
lice have so far found nothing that would
lead to the assumption that he had any
thing to do' with the shooting.
Anderson stated that on the night of
the shooting he went Into the saloon on
the northeast corner of . Clementina ard
Second streets, took a drink and con
versed for a few minutes, returning to
his room about 9:45 o'clock. He ascribes
tne connection of his name 'with the case
to the unfounded suspicions of Annie An
derson's , relations.
' Alfred :' Gustaf sen, whose name is also
mentioned (in connection .with, the shoot-
Ing, Is a seafaring man,^employed on the
City of Piiebla. He will return to the
city on Friday, the steamer on which he
is employed â¢ being - engaged on the Vic
toria, run. ' .
Louise ,; Meyer, Miss Anderson's friend,
still" refuses to make ' a statement. The
people. by -whom she -Is employed would
not, allow her. to be seen : by ,. newspaper
men yesterday. The excuse was made
at", the house that she was â¢ out. The po
lice think, that she knows more about, the
matter, than she "has yet disclosed.
Under the careful ministrations of the
physicians attached to the Central Emer
gency. Hospital . Annie Anderson continues
to * improve. â¢ As ; soon ' as ; she is able to
stand the ordeal â¢ she will be closely ques
tioned by. the detectives. Her stories, as
so far related,- do not seem to bear tbV
"She never saw me," he declared with
emphasis. "I'll wager my life that she
Will SO tell SOU."
After being taken to the City Prison
Almberg asked permission to send for a
friend, which request was denied. He
said that the friend was with him on the
night that Miss Anderson was shot, and,
according to his claim, he would prove
that he was not in any way connected
with the shoo'ting. Who the friend is he
refused to say, except that he was also a
former soldier.
At 1 o'clock this morning tha police
located Almberg's room. They found an .
overcoat and a dark suit of clothes, which
were identified as' belonging to the sus
pect. The man who shot Miss Anderson
wore an overcoat similar to the one founa ,

these facts became known to the
jBIjc Basin Park Commissioners they saw
the necessity for immediate action. Gov
ernor Gage, who Is the president of the
commission, telegraphed to Washington
and requested Senator Perkins to have
the Government lands in the Big Basin
withdrawn from entry pending investiga
tion Into the question of whether the sev
eral tracts could be made available to the
State of California for a park. Favorable
action was secured at Washington, and if
there are any little private speculations
based on these' Government lands they
are now dead. If the State needs the
lands It will probably get them free of
cost, and will not be compelled to pay a
great price for them. Including the piece
sought by Miss McKinney, the exact area
of Government lands in the Big Basin is
KÂ£5.80 acre3. /Â¦Â¦ â¢
Santa Cruz County assessment un
der the designation of "unknown
owners." The prospect of losing
control of one mile of Waddell Creek at
this point suggested that there might oth
er dangers In store for the park as a Stats
proposition hidden in the "unknown own
ers" lands. At any rate a map was made
under the direction of the commission by
the United States Land Â¦ Office, and the
revelations that were thereby brought to
the Commissioners are summarized easily.
There are fourteen pieces marked on the
County Assessor's map In Santa Cruz to
"unknown owners" which were discovered
to belong to the Government, and accord
ingly open to entry. These are all in
Township 9 south. In section 18. range 3
west, there are S5.80 acres; in section 3,
range 4 west, 240 acres; In section 11,
range 4 west, 360 acres; in section 13,
range 4 west, SCO acres; ' In section 14.
range 4 west, 160 acres; in section 24,
range 4 west, 120 acres. To any. one fa
miliar with Government land maps it wiH
instantly appear that these pieces are
somewhat scattered, but the fact will not
be made evident without explanation that
some of these lands so mysteriously car
ried on the Santa Cruz County Assessor's
books are in very sightly localities.
One 6pot is on a precipice that is many
hundred feet 'highâ a Eightly location for
the placing of come sort of a summer
proposition in the bands of private own
ers in case the Big Basin is turned into
a park. There is at least one other ste
on a ridge included in the Government
holdings that Is eligible for private usa
and gain, supposing the park, to exist.
These may be only coincidences, but they

daughter. The attorney told of Nora
calling- at his office with messages from
Mrs. Fuller and also to secure carfare.
He. denied that he had at any time ever
taken 'Â¦ Nora Fuller to a restaurant or
theater, or that he Jiad seen her since
the day of her disappearance until he
was asked to Identify her body.
Mary Johnson, residing at 2209 . Sutter
street, testified to giving the keys of the
house at 2211 Sutter street to a man on
two occasions.-- This man answered the
description of. Bennett or Hawkins, and
on the last occasion when he called for
the keys he had retained, them.
Isldor Levy, a letter-carrier, was the
last witness called yesterday. He stated
that mail passed through his hands for
the Golden "West Hotel, and that some
letters were delivered at the hotel ad
dressed to "C. B. Hawkins." These let
ters also bore the address, "or 2211' Sut
ter street," and when the clerk at the
hotel said that Hawkins was not there
the witness ' had marked . the letters for
delivery at 2211 Sutter street.
The investigation was then adjourned
until this morning at 10 o'clock.
ALL CLEWS LEAD TO NOTHING
Nora Fuller's Murderer.
K"o Progress Being Made in Tracing
Absolutely nothing new developed yes
terday in the search for the man who
murdered Nora Fuller. Every story and
other bit of evidence that might lead to
the detection of the criminal have been
sifted thoroughly, but as far as fixing
the identity of the slayer the police are in
exactly ."the same position they were when
the- body, was first identified.
Â¦ Captain. Seymour does not think that
the Coroner's inquest, so. far as it has
gone, has thrown any new light on the
case, nor- is he hopeful that anything will
be adduced by the investigation that is
not already known to the police. ;
ItMs admitted by Captain Seymour that
a promising report was received from
Placerville regarding a suspect who is
now under surveillance there. - The infor
mation was sent by the Sheriff of El Do
rado County, who thinks from the de
scription of Bennett or Hawkins and
otlier collateral circumstances that the
Fuller murderer may be a clgarmaker of
Placerville. The suspect is x>elng closely
watched to prevent escape while the cir
cumstances connecting him with the mur
der are being thoroughly inve3tigate"d Â¦ by
the San Francisco police and the officials
of Placerville. . _

evident that while trying to light the gas
she had fallen in a faint and was as

peared' before .-the j Judiciary. Committee.
Mrs." Carrie " Chapman Catt,' president of
the association, explained .to the commit
tee'that-she desired- particularly that the
foreign' delegates should describe to the
committee the woman suffrage movement
in other parts of the world. The speak
ers to-day- were -Miss Vida "Goids-teAn of
Australia, Mrs. Ewald of Sweden, Mrs.
Freedland of Russia, Mrs. Fenwlck Miller
of England, i ! Isabel Campbell of .Wyo
ming," Miss Theodosia Ammons of Colo
rado, Mrs. Lapish of Utah, Miss Weaver
of .Idaho and Mrs. Catt: . " . â¢
.;â¢ Â¦ Miss i Goldstein, * the .< first speaker, told
of the struggle and success of the woman
suffrage ' movement in different ; portions
of Australia, and explained the political
status of .women there, as well as the
great benefits that: had - followed thfc
granting of suffrage to ' women. The pre â¢
dictions .of the adversaries of woman suf
frage had utterly failed, ,she declared." Â¦ Â¦
' "The women.' of Australia," she said,
"do not forget their. homes or their ba
bies, and they do not raid the public of
fices.", :â¢-Â¦-' Â¦ ;' Â¦ . : Â¦ :/Â¦.',Â¦
, Mrs. Freedland explained that in a coun
try like I Russia there was, : of â¢ course, lit
tle suffrage, but what there is is shared
equally by men. and women. In a coun
try whose political laws were the least
liberal those laws were the : most liberal
to the civil capacities of women.
Â¦Â¦Â¦' Mrs. Ewald of Sweden and Mrs. Drew
son of Norway, where women paying 1
taxes on an income the. equivalent of $100
a year enjoy ; suffrage,' told of, the auf
frage privileges enjoyed by , women in
their "countries. In. Sweden women en-
Joyed the ballot before men."
Miss Campbell, who Is the daughter of
the first â¢ Governor of "Wyoming, the 1 ex
ecutive who signed the woman suffrage
law,, declared j that, every Â¦ Governor of
Wyoming had testified that woman suf
frage had worked out. â¢ . . â
Miss Ammons of Colorado declared that
every woman elected to office in Colorado
had reflected credit upon her sex. Mrs.
Mary Wood Swift of California, said Se
partment stores had driven many women
from employment and that the protests
against them have not even made a dent
in ' economic ; condltiona. For this and
other reasons she supported woman suf
frage. \ .Â¦'.,-'
The Rev. Anna Shaw closed the hear
ing:. She recalled the thirty-two years of
knocking ' at the door of Congress for
woman suffrage. Years ago', she said,' the
"women came here with only theories," but
to-day they could stand on the result of
suffrage wherever it has been granted .In
thiscountry. She'urged the appointment
of / a : committee - to Â¦Â¦ investigate : the ques
tion'of whether -suffrage had or had not
been a success in those States. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦Â¦ â¢ . -
' Mrs. Catt, in :Â¦ concluding the hearing,
said the association could hardly hope for
a' 1 favorable report on the joint suffrage
resolution before the committee, but in
all justice she asked' for'an investigation
of- the result of the woman suffrage in th*
four States of Idaho, Utah. Colorado and
"Wyoming. Â¦Â¦*, For the present, she said, tl'c
association would be content with/that.
"If you ;do not find it a good thing," she

TRIESTE, Feb. 18.â Three Austrian
warships have arrived here and have
landed bluejackets to protect the harbor
and the Austrian Lloyd Steamship Com

have been arrested. Quiet prevails here
and the bluejackets-landed to protect the
harbor and the docks have been with
drawn. An Italian anarchist agitator
named Brontzi, from Ancolo, has been ar
rested. .
After a heated debate and violent So
cialist denunciations of the troops and
Governor of Trieste a Government â¢ bill
authorizing the. establishment of martial
law passed its first reading and it was de

report on the Trieste disturbance within

VIENNA, Feb. 18.â In the Relchsrath
to-day the Premier; made a vigorous de
fense of the action of the police at Trieste
during the recent riots, contending that
anarchists and not workmen were at the
bottom of the trouble. The Premier fur
ther asserted that an investigation had
resulted in establishing- beyond a doubt
the existence of a terrorist organization,
whose creed was absolute lawlessness,
and against which the whole force tafthe
defensive powers of the -state must be
called. The Governor of Trieste, he said,
acted In accordance with his duty In pro
claiming martial law and the police and
military authorities had shown much tact
and good will in performing their difficult
duties. Martial law would be withdrawn
so soon as public order was restored and
not before. â¢ .

the result of unsatisfactory conditions. We be
lieved when Â¦ we, gave our suffrage to a man

HIS CANDIDACY
V. Special Dispatch to The Call. '
\ ALTURAS, Feb. 18.â John E. Raker is
' demonstrating that he can "go a route"
oratorically. . Throughout; all of to-day
and during .this evening's session of court
he continued his closing argument on- be
half of James W. ; Brown, the alleged
Lookout lyncher." At times the fiery law
yer could not control his tongue and he
was frequently called to order by â¢; the
court for launching upon violent denun
ciations of the prosecution and certain
of its witnesses. During one ' of these
"spells'* Raker, used the. word "."damn,"
which bo shocked the court' that the at
torney was fined $10, with the alternative
of spending | two days in Jail at the ex
piration, of the trial of Brown.- Raker had
not concluded when to-night's session was
adjourned, and as he has given no visible
signs of exhaustion there Is no telling
at this time how much, longer the trial
will last. In opening Raker said: .-
If the . court please, and you, r gentlemen of
thÂ« jury, there are a great many things in this
case I desire to bring to your notice and I will
endeavor to present them as concisely as pos
sible. I will try to sift kernels of wheat from
the chaff. I don't intend to abuse or malign
anybody, nor, bo far as I am concerned, to be
little any witness who has testified before you,
but I do intend to present the evidence of those
witnesses and let that evidence speak to you
whether or not they have told what were facts,
or whether they told what they did for a will
ful deliberate, premeditated purpose. 1 will
trust to the honest, candid Judgment of you
twelve men to determine whether the testimony
is true cr false. I am going to ask you, gentle
men. Â¦ what you think of Â¦ the open-handedness
of tie prosecution in â¢ this case, whether the
prosecution has Â¦ been conducted as it should
have been by the Attorney General. I will
ask you whether you believe that the prosecu
tion has been open-handed and fair as it should
have beenTwhen every attempt was made to ex
clude the evidence offered by "the defendant. Is
that the way the great State of California
wants the case prosecuted, by one side. only?
Shots at the Prosecution.
Raker said that the improbability of
Agnss Wilson's story and her contradic
tory statements would crush her testi
mony by its own weight. He claimed the
witness had been supplied by Post with
a typewritten copy of what she was to
testify to. Raker asserted that the girl
had been influenced to testify falsely. .
The speaker reviewed the testimony of
fourteen citizens of Modoc to show that
Robert Courtwright'B reputation was bad,
and pointed out that the prosecution
could produce but three .witnesses to say
It was good. Said he:
A masked man on the highway Is a gentle
man beside a. "iq" like Courfwrlgrht, Â¦ â¢who
iwears to God to tell the truth and then gives
evidence that places an innocent man in a
prison cell for a reward.
Raker discussed the statements of Lai e
Harris, .to the effect that on the after
noon of May 27 he saw Robert Leventon;
Richard Kichols.and" James ~WV Brown* In
the office of Leventon's blacksmith shop
and heard them discussing the lynching.
Harris had said he saw them through the
office window and overheard the conver
sation. Raker asked how it was possible
for Harris, who was under average
height, ! to see through a window which
-was moite than' eight feet above the
ground. Raker declared Harris . was un
der the influence of friends of the prose
j cution and had been "educated" as to his
testimony. - r : ;^^
Baker Earns a Fine.
Raker reviewed the testimony of many
other witnesses of the prosecution and
carefully analyzed each bit of evidence.
He analyzed the evidence of Charles Lam
bert and Myron Ayres, who testified re
garding the inquest held over the bodies
of the lynched men. They had declared
that It was common talk in Lookout that
the Inquest vras a farcical proceeding, and
quoted James W. Brown as having said
that he knew the prisoners were to be
lynched, and that the lynchers came to
the hotel earlier than he (Brown) had ex
pected. Referring to the cross-examina
tion of Myron Ayres, in â¢ which Ayres
made several contradictory Â¦ statements.
Raker said:
The court will instruct you under the law
that you should view the declaration â¢ of such
a witness with distrust; his whole : testimony
should be viewed with distrust. ... -
Post interrupted Raker, saying that
there was no such provision in the law.
The Court â Mr. Raker has no authority to
say what the court's Instructions to the Jury
will be. There is no law which says the
whole testimony of a witness shall be viewed
with distrust and the court will not so in
struct in . the . case. :
Spencer â Don't argue the matter, John.-,
Raker â Damn it, I don't care what any one
says. I know what the law is. . - â¢
The Court â Mr. Raker, you are fined $10 or
you wiil go to Jail for two days at the end of
this trial for using profane language in your
argument. Â¦
Spencer â That was a small thing to fine a
man for. '.-.-Â¦' . Â» .
Raker â Heycan't more than" quarter me and
pull me to pieces. Every time I open my
mouth I am chucked into Jail and fined.
- The Court â If you have no more decency and
manliness than to use cuss words in an argu
ment I will send you to Jail, come weal, come
woe.
Preliminary to taking up ;the testimony
of Claude Morris and John Hutton, the
men who confessed to participation In the
lynching and who implicated the men
now in jail here awaiting trial. Raker
said:
The prosecution is worse off with the Hutton
and Uorris confessions than they were .when
they closed their circumstantial case. A con
fession is no good unless corroborated by other
evidence and these confessions are contradicted
by witnesses for the prosecution.
One Evidence of Innocence. '
Th"e claim has been made that - on the
night John ' Hutton made his confession
at Stewart Hall the place was surrounded
by armed men' who threatened to . raid the
building to prevent Hutton making his
statement to the presocution, news of the
proposed confession having traveled fast
through the town. Of this Raker said:
There were forty opportunities to ehoot them
had any one wanted to. A bullet could' have
been sent through their reeking, rotten brain*
as they stood at the windows - In their â¢Â¦ glass
house of iniquityâ^.hat house - of : h (as
Raker calls the Grand Central Hotel,. where the
prosecution has Its headquarters) â to . prevent
them from testifying In this case had any one
wanted to. If Jim Brown and the Other men
in Jail were guilty and knew Hutton and Mortis
knew anything against ' them, . why: did not
Brown get them out of the way forever? If
men will commit the awful' crime of 'taking the
life of old man Calvin Hall of 75 years, who has
gone through the civil war, and swing him' into
eternity, would they not have sent a bullet
through .. the heads of . Morris and Hutton . if
they knew anything against him- to save hia
own life and that of his friends?
Raker made reference to a' Texas case
to show that Brown would have been jus
tified" in killing Hutton and Morris to
save his own life and keep his home from
being ruined by such testimony as theirs.
Raker then took up the statement of
Claude Morris that" he had made in his
confession freely and voluntarily, and In
quired If it was common, sense that he
would come to Alturas to make such a
statement voluntarily and .be met < three
miles out of town by armed friends of the
prosecution and escorted to the headquar
ters of the prosecution throtwh a. v back
B.treet. Addressing the jury ., Raker said,
referring to Morris: . . '
There is no doubt in the world but that that
boy had nothing more to do with that lynching

Judge Harris or I had., Tha story of his belnr

GEBMANTOWN, Feb. 18.â August
Hasch, a young man employed by Hoch
heimer & Co. of this place, was stabbed
to death last night. Suspicion points to a
vagrant named John Wallace as the mur
derer, and all day long posses have been
searching the country in every direction
In the hope of effecting his capture. Late
to-night it was rumored here that Wal
lace had been captured by a blacksmitn
In Kirkwood and that Deputy Sheriff Z.
T. Cowart was taking him to V/illowo.
This report has not been verified.
G. A. Gutman and A. D. -Piper, mer
chants, were going home last night, when
they heard groans proceeding from- a
cross street. They went to investigate
and found Hasch lying face downward
and in the last throes of death. Help was
summoned and he was conveyed to his
home, where it was found that the left
femoral artery had been severed, while
two suijeriicial cuts appeared on the neck
and over the heart. Hasch died within a
few minutes.
A careful search showed blood stains
on the ground, extending from the gate
in the rear of Hasch's home to the point
where the body was found, a distance of
ninety yards. Hasch evidently had been
stabbed at his own back gate.
Coroner Franey and District Attorney
Ix>r>g were summoned and an inquest was
held Immediately. The verdict of the jury
was that Hasch had come to his death
by a knife wound inflicted by a person
urknown.
-â¢Jack" "Wallace has been in this sectlcp
before and knew some of the working
men. He owed Hasch a small sum of
money, and the tvro were seen together
lsst evening. Just after tapper Hasch
hesrd a noise in his barn and went out to
learn the cause. That was the last time
he was seen until he was found dying on
the street. As Wallace could not be
found, the general belief was that he
vas the culprit, and posses were out all
HSgfct and to-day in search of him.

BLADDER TROUBLE
Had to Pass Water Very Often Day and Night.
Cured by the Great Kidney Remedy, Swamp Root.
DR., KILMER & CO., Binghamton, N. T. .,-!, . '.
About two years ago I had a very severe case of kidney and bladder trouble.
The pain in the small of my back was so severe that I could not stand it to stay in
one position more than a moment or two, Â¦ and was obliged to pass water very
often>f5.y and night. I tried medicines and doctors without getting relief. Noticing
â¢ an advertisement in the Topeka. State Journal of Swamp-Root, I determined to
,' give it a trial, and bought a bottle. By the time I had finished the first bottle the
pain had entirely disappeared from my back. The pain and frequent desire to
pass water ceased. However, I continued : to take the medicine, using about six
' bottles in all. That was over a year ago, and I have had no return of the trouble

ADVERTISEMENTS.
FEIEDjNiflHS
Indirectly Caused th3 Death of
the World's Greatest General.
It is a matter of history that Napoleon was
e gourmand, an inordinate lover of the pood
things of the table, and history further records
that his favorite dish was fried onions; his
death from cancer of stomach, it is claimed
elso, was probably caused from his excessive .
indulgence of this fondness for the odorous '
vegetable.
The onion is undoubtedly a wholesome article
cf food, in fact has many medicinal qualities of
value, but it would be difficult to find a more
Irfiig-estlble article than frieÂ»- onions, and to
nar-j- pecpl* they are simply poi6oa, . but the
cnion does r.ot stand alone in this respect. Any
trt:c> of food that is not thoroughly digested
becomes a source of disease and discomfort,
Â¦whether it be fried onions or beefsteak.
reason why any wholesome food Is not
promptly digested is because the stomach lacks
6omÂ«Â» important element 'of digestion. Some
Etomachs lack peptcne. others are deficient ia
gastric juice, et:Il others lack hydrochloric acid.
The one thing -necessary to do in any case of
I^oor cig-estion is to supply those elements of
<3igerticn which thÂ« stomach lacks, and nothing
do?-s this so thoroughly and safely as Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.
Dr. Richarfiscn, in writing a thesis on .treat-
ment cf dyspepsia and Indigestion, closes his
rt=msrke by saj'ing: "For those suffering from
a c'd dyspepsia, shown by pour, watery risings,
or fcr flatulent dyspepsia. Â«?bov. r n by gas on the
Eicmach. causing- heart trouble and difficult
b:-eathlng. as well as for all other. forms of.
stomach trouble, the safest treatment is to
take cr.e or two of Stu2rt'e Dyspepsia Tablets
aftrr each meal, l^advise them because they
cor.tain no harmful drugs, but . are I composed
cf valuable digestives, which ect promptly upon
the food eaten. I never knew a case of indl-
frettion cr even chronic dyspepsia which
Stuart's Tablets would not reach."' '
(Jhean cathartic medicines claiming to cure
dyspepsia 1 and Indigestion can have no effect
Whatever in actively digesting the food, and
to call any cathartic medicine a cure for indl- '
geÂ»tion is a mlsr.omer.
E\-ery druggist in the United States and
Canada sells Stuart's Dyspepsia Tableta, and
they are not only the naf Â»st and Â¦ most suc-
. cessful. bat the most scientific of any treatment

The steer made his debut by leaping
over the fence into City Hall square, la
ten minutes there was not a patch ten
feet square left out of the general ruin
of the garden. Followed by a cowboy
the steer then dashed through Chinatown,
smashing several doors and windows en
route and causing consternation among:
the Celestials. When it rushed up . Pen
der street, one oS the principal business
centers, everything except the street cars
had to make way and people were run
ning In all directions. More windows
went down, and then the big animal took
to tjie residential district In the west end,
two miles away from where it first start
ed. There people were forced to duck un
der sidewalks and hastily climb over
fences to avoid being gored . to death.
Finally the steer was run down and las
soed.
VANCOUVER. B. C. Feb. 18.â A bis
steer from a band of cattle being brought
into Vancouver from the upper country
took possession of most of the city thu
morning. For two hours the pranks of:
the animal were devoted to the tearing up
of gardens and lawns, the breaking of
several hundred dollars* worth of i plat<Â»
glass and the stampeding of crowds on
the business streets.

O'Connor also rode the winner of the
mile and a furling event, in The Fret
ter. Frank O'Rourke's useful horse had
a. slight call over Wolhurst In the ring,
and should have beaten the last named
horae two, or three lengths instead of a
neck. Down the stretch it looked an easy
victory for The Fretter and O'Connor be
gan taking matters a trifle easy. At the
paddock Lee Jackson on Wolhurst drew
his whip, and,* the old fellow responding,
brought O'Conor and his mount to a hard
drive. The show went- to Formero.
Bickenruthon Lodestar, winner of the
closing-event, proved a big improvement
over Troxler, who piloted the horse on
February 13. Well played at 7 and 8 to- 1,
the outsider never lacked for speed, run
ning in three . lengths before Hungarian.
Flamero, the favorite, apparently died
away in the stretch; 'even losing the show
to Quiz. â¢ -..:;.-; --, -. .
Barney Schreiber's Killdoe ran away
from his company in the five and a half
furlong selling dash. A 1 to 2 favorite
with Lee Jackson up, the Foul Shot geld
ing led El Kara over .the. mark three
lengths. Courtier took the show from
the weakly-handled Rasp.
' After considerable see-sawing Redwald
finally closed equal favorite with John
Peters for the six and a half furlong run.
The latter colt was Â¦ giving away some
weight, and * his stay out in front was
limited. O'Connor assumed the front po
sition with Redwald when ready, downing-
February, a 20 to 1 chance, without ef
fort. Â¦
So fluctuating were the odds against
Buck Taylor in the betting on the seven
furlong selling affair that it was difficult
to tell whether the stable fancied the
chestnut or not. He showed to- be good
by racing out ln the lead with the favor
ite El Rey, and then won cleverly by two
lengths. Troxler on Alturas ran Into the
show.
Although The Weaver went to the post
a 1 to 3 favorite for the opening sprint,
the big colt found it no easy trick to beat
Bassenzo. The latter made all the run

When the Dirigo Jeft for the* south it
was not certain that all the men in tha
mine had escaped, but Assistant Superin
tendent McKenzie and Shift Boss Eaton
made the trip down from the old pit and
gave it as their opinion that every ona
had got out safely. .;;*".
In the meantime, with the help of ad
ditional fire apparatus from Douglas, th-3
fire had been confined to -the .compressor
building, the shaft, the shaft house and a
near-by mill building. These were de
stroyed.
The firemen combined their efforts on
the mill adjacent to the compressor build
ing, and, though their clothing frequent
ly caught fire and their hands and facea
were badly blistered, they finally got the
flames under control, after several build
ings\had been destroyed.
ln the meantime the flames in the shaft
had been burning rapidly". Swans Bar
quist, one of the miners working on tha
330-foot level, was the first to gain knowl
edge of the fire above. He shouted a
warning to the ; miners on the 440-foot
level. The. latter crew, however, mistook
his excited cry of "fire" for a blasting
signal, and. Instead of making their way
toward the upper levels, went farther
back on their own. level. When the men
had finally gathered on the 330- foot level

SEATTLE. Feb. 18.â With the arrival of
the steamship Diiigo from Alaska* this
morning came news of a conflagration at
the Treadwell mines on Douglas Island
on February 11 and the narrow escape of
100 miners from death. The Alaska-Amer
ican compressor building was destroyed.
While the names raged the miners in the
lower workings were in a desperate situ
ation. Dozens of volunteers asked to bÂ«s
allowed to go down through the burning
shaft and warn the imprisoned men. Suck
an act, would have . been suicidal, how
ever, and the combined efforts of. the firÂ«
brigades -were put to saving the remain
der of the vast mine buildings.

tried a left but failed. Britt also sent a
hard one wide of the mark. Britt worked
him into a corner, where Irwin slipped
down. Britt landed alright and left to
the head. . Britt had the best of a mix
up, Irwin making some complaint to the
referee. Britt joked him about it, saying,
"What's the matter?"
Britt landed his left as usual when pro
ceedings opened in the third. Irwin fol
lowed with a left to the head. Britt
chased Irwin. across the ring, landing re
peatedly, but not doing much damage.
Irwln broke the skin on Britt's nose,
which bled slightly. In a mix-up both
stumbled to the floor. Irwin seemed
afraid of Britt, the latter's body punches
telling on him. Irwin landed two straight
lefts and again stumbled. It began to
look like the end as Britt hustled his op
ponent around the ring. Britt showered
blows on him during the last ten seconds
and had him groggy.
Irwin seemed tired In the fourth. He
was the first to lead, but did no damage.
Brftt sent him against the ropes with
some hard body blows. Britt plugged him
repeatedly with right and left, but in his
over-anxiety to end the affair his blows
proved ineffective. Irwln showed the ef
fect of the pace which the ex-amateur
was setting, while the latter was quite
fresh.
Britt took a breathing spell in the fifth
and few hard blows were exchanged. - *
The sixth round wound up in a fierce
slugging match, the plucky young
sters exchanging . rights and - lefts.
The round opened with Britt lead
ing as usuaL He sent his right
to tho body hard. He then sent his right
to the head, and Irwln hung on to avoid
punishment. Irwin landed two on the
head, but did no damage. Britt sent a
terrific right over to Irwin's jaw, but It
proved a glaifcing blow and did no dam-

FIGHT j IN OAKLAND, AND
RINGSIDE CHARACTERS.

The first preliminary bout was between
Frank George and Gene Young. George
went after his opponent fiercely, swing
ing wildly and landing occasionally. The
second round- was give and take, each
man having it bad at* times. The third
and " fourth rounds were full of Â¦ roueh
and-tumble fighting. In the fifth George
played for the body with telling effect.
The last round was a' mixture of hugging
and slugging. George was given the de
cision on points. '
"Young" Gibbs; weighing 142" pounds,
fought Jack McDonald, who weighed 163
Pounds. Â¦ Near the end of the first round
McDonald hustled Gibbs out of the rinjr
the latter falling heavily. . In the earlier
part of the round Gibbs proved much the
better boxer. ,.
Early in the second round, In a wild
wrestling match, both men fell and rolled
over the. lower rope of the ring. Â¦ They
stayed down four i seconds. McDonald
was first up and while Gibbs was still on
his knees the former lost his head and
rushed at him. He struck . . Gibbs Â¦. and

Gibbs Wins on a FouL
Britt started the last round as fresh as
when he entered the ring-, while Irwlu
looked jaded, as would, any boxer who
had taken the punishment he did. Britt
sent a left to the head and then a right
which staggered Irwin. Tobey was nearlr
out and hung on.- Britt kept peppering
his body and once knocked him down
with a clean blow. When the end of the
round came Referee Kitchen pointed to
Britt as the winner. " . Â¦:-. -..' Â¦-.,.
It was all Britt in the ninth, Irwin
hanging on to avoid punishment. Britt
landed at will on head and body. Â¦
They slowed down in the tenth, neither
doing much damage. . . r
The eleventh round ended with Irwiri
retreating and Britt chasing him around
the ring. :'\ Â¦ :, ...
In the twelfth Britt tried several times
for a right cross to the jaw but: missed.
He succeeded in landing it on the body
with deadly effect. , ..-'.
The thirteenth was : Britt's round Ir
win's only hard Wow, was- a right to the
head. Britt returned it with. interest Â¦
Britt landed a right cross on the head
which sounded all over the house in the
fourteenth round. It must have missed
its mark or Irwin would have gone out.
Irwin was nearly out when the gong again
saved him. He hung on to avoid punish*
ment.
Britt had Irwln in extreme danger in
the eighth, the bell barely saving the
North Beach boy. Britt planted a stiff
right to the heart and cleverly ducked a
hard swing. Britt sent a right to the body
and a left to the head which left Irwin
\\eak and defenseless. Britt followed him
all over the ring, showering blows on him.
In his excitement his aim was bad. ' Just
at the bell he landed a clean right and
left to the head.' :-.- -
Irwin freshened up decidedly in the
seventh and it seemed he was striking his
gait. Britt started matters with a left to
the body and then a hard right. Irwin
then went at him, sending right and left to
the head. They did not daze- Britt, who

Britt Starts the Fighting.
When the gong sent them together in
the first round Britt was the first to lead
sending a left to the body. He. followed
this up with another left, which sent Ir
win back. Irwin stumbled, but Britt did
not take advantage of the opening. In a
mixup Britt proved much the cleverer,
landing a stiff uppercut to the head. Britt
rushed him across - the ring and nearly
through the ropes. Irwin kept going
away, with the apparent design of letting
Britt fight himself out. Just as the bell
rang Irwin landed a left to the head.
In the second round Britt opened pro-
Irwin fought a game, uphill fight. From
the start he seemed outclassed, although
some spectators thought for a time he
was letting Britt fight himself ouU The
latter* s friends; were nervous about the
fifth and sixth rounds, but the ex-ama
teur champion went any pace his oppo
nent set before him and never slowed up.
When Referee Jack Kitchen declared
Britt the^ winner the house went wild.
Britt's seconds lifted him on their shoul
ders and carried him across the ring to
where his father was standing. He re
ceived the latter's congratulations and
those of some of his friends. He was then
landed J among his Olympic Club friends,
who nearly shook the hands ' off their
champion.
Britt was pronounced the cleverest ama
teur ever seen in the ring here under sim
ilar conditions. At times he showed a
lack of experience in following up an ad
vantage. Had he had the experience
which a couple of four-round professional
flghts would afford him he would have
won last night inside five rounds.
There were 2700 spectators at the fight
The receipts were $2194 50. Of this Use
boxers and the club each received half
Britt's share was 5937 40 and Irwin's
$309 85. In addition Britt wagered more
than S1D00 on his chances, having unlim
ited confidence In his ability to win. Tho
betting at the ringside was 10 to 6 in favor
of Britt.
JAMES B. BRITT, amateur light
weight boxing champion of the Pa
cific Coast, defeated Toby Irwln on
points last night in the gymnasium
of the Acme Athletic Club, Oak
land. The winner disproved a time-hon
ored idea that the professional in any
walk of life, be it art. literature, music,
drama or athletics, has a big advantage
over the amateur.
Not since 1891, when "Jim" Corbett
fought his memorable sixty-one-round
â¢draw in this city with Peter Jackson, has
there been such widespread interest and
sentiment shown in the appearance of a.
local boxer as were brought out byBritt's
intention to enter ' the ranks of profes
sional boxers. . Â«
The attendance last night was almost
entirely drawn from this side of the bay,
being made up of business and profes
sional men, and a large number of Olym
pic Club men.
. From the start Britt outclassed Irwin.
He proved a faster boxer, a harder hit
ter and took what punishment he received
without wincing, lie proved to be in su
perb condition, going nearly every round
at top speed. He was as fresh in the last
round as in the first.
He was always the first to lead at the
opening of each round, and as he invari
;iuiy pxayed for the body he took much
of the speed out of Irwin. The bell saved
toe latter in several rounds, as he was all
but out and hung on to avoid punish
ment Britt strikes a blow like that of a
iniddie-weifht. He was fortunate. in hav
ing the services of two euch seconds ' as
"topidu" Kelly and Tim McGrath. The
former has no equal in coaching a boxer
in the ring, while^ McGrath is a marvel in
freshening up a man between rounds. The
combination worked like clockwork last
night. Britt should give due credit to his
clever handlers.

THE Oceanic Steamship Company's
Sonoma arrived yesterday from.
Australia with more than 200 pas
sengers and a large cargo. She
encountered her full share of the
boisterous weather that has been so plen
tiful of late all over the Pacific, but came
Through without mishap. The Sonoma
left Sydney January 28, Auckland Febru
ary 1. Pago Pago February 5 and Hono
lulu February 12. Among- the passengers
from Honolulu was a troop of colored
singers, who obliged with a few lusty
selections while the big liner was being
cocked. The Sonoma ran according to
schedule in spite of the constant opposi
tion ot the elementsJ From Auckland to
Honolulu strong head winds prevailed, ac
companied by big seas. After leavirig
Honolulu a whole gale from the south
southwest was encountered. The w'nd
thifted on February 14 to the west-north
west, with terrific squalls a t frequent in
tervals. This continued until Monday aft
ernoon, when wind and sea moderated
and continued reasonably calm to port.

TJmatilla in Quarantine.
. The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Umatilla, Â¦which was due from Â¦ Seattle
last Sunday, did not arrive' until yester
day morning, the voyage having occupied
103 hours. The quarantine officials found
a second-cabin passenger suffering from
a disease suspiciously like smallpox, and
the vessel, was ordered to Angel Island.
The steamship will probably be released
to-day, | but the length of detention to
Â¦which the passengers will be subjected
will depend upon the development of the
suspicious case. As Seattle is known to
be a hotbed of smallpox, it is feared the
Umatllla's passengers may have an op-

Â¦ HONOLULU, Feb. ! 1Lâ During the last
two days the Governorship of Hawaii has
still been the sole topic, of discussion. It

"Isit not true. that the President reÂ«

The scheme is vast, but it is none too vast for the
progressive men who have built up the great Ameri
can fortunes that are the wonder of the world. Ac
cordingly we may indulge the hope that it will be
carried out on the scale that has been suggested. It
could not be possible in any other Jand, but in the
United States it may be realized .within a year.
Should the plan be carried out on the scale pro
posed it will be the greatest educational enterprise
ever undertaken by private munificence. It would
also be vastly beneficial, for it would carry help to
colleges where help is most needed. Instead -of
building up a few great universities, as has been the
tendency of ' millionaire philanthropists in the past,
it would aid the smaller institutions and give every
section of the country a share iiV the munificence of
the contributors.
While the enterprise has not yet been definitely
organized, it is said to be fairly well matured and
lias bright prospects of immediate success. More
than a dozen men of large wealth, including \wo of
the Rockefeller family, are reported to have given
it their approval and to have pledged several millions
of dollars to be paid into the fund as soon as organi
zation has been effected^ Moreover, it is added that
the details have been so far worked out that it is de
cided the central board shall consist of fifteen mem
bers and that tile president shall be William H. Bald
win Jr., president of the Long Island Railway Com
pany, a gentleman who has shared in Southern edu
cational work and is familiar with the needs of that
section.
various States by branch organizations. Carrying
out the original' idea, the efforts of the central body
will be directed for^a time mainly to the South, but
when the immediate needs of that section have been
supplied, then the revenues will be devoted to other
sections.
REPORTS from the East announce that there
has been undertaken in New York, in the in
terests of education, a philanthropic move
ment which is expected to far exceed all that has
been done in the past, even in the foundation by pri
vate munificence of such great universities as Stan
ford and Chicago. The plan is to establish a fund for
the promotion of education generally throughout
the country and to use the interest of it for all time
to come to assist communities that are in most need
of assistance.
The enterprise is said to be the outcome "of a re
cent discussion concerning the needs of the" South
in the way of higher education. While. Northern
and Western colleges have received large endow
ments from private sources, those of the South have:
not been so fortunate. Of the many millions of dol- !
lars given last year for educational purposes by gen
erous men and women, the Southern States received^
very little. The result has been the development of
a wide difference between the educational advan
tages of the South and those of the rest of the coun
try, and it is now recognized that the general good
of the republic requires that something be done to
help the South forward in order that her people
may have something like equality with those of other
sections in this respect
Out of that consideration came a movement di
rected first to obtaining contributions for Southern
colleges, but later on it was expanded into the pres
ent plan of forming a permanent fund for assisting
whatever section of the country may be in need of
better educational facilities. The plan now proposed
is to establish a central educational board, which
will direct in a general' way the work to be done in

It became necessary, to send a military force across
these northern alps to test the question of penetra- .
bili.ty of the country by a foreign enemy, for, these
are stirring times^in the East, and Japan has a manly
part to play, which can be maintained only by know
ing all her offensive and defensive resources. Of old
her people marched down the Korean Peninsula, not
only blazing a; path but claim-staking a, country
against the day. they might come back. Then they \
crossed the narrow waters to conquest the Ainos and
their islands. Korea and Manchuria are of immense
interest to them, and they are ready to" fight against
the servile subjection' of either with the same stub
bornness that they will put into defense of their own
islands. So it became necessary to know what an
invader, could do in Awomori, and " this must be
known by experiment. Aforce of infantry was sent
to make the test. Each man seems to^have known
the purpose of the expedition". No doubt each was
firm in the patriotic belief that no other could suc
ceed where he failed and that no other could follow Â¦
where he succeeded.
In those far alps they met the enemy that con
quers conquerors* the foe that beat Bonaparte back
from Russia and that long before had penned Han
nibal up in Italy. Winter fell upon Hanabe and
Yakoda. Snow and tempest choked the mountain
passes. The swollen 'streams chanted dirges. The
demon of the Yi was abroad, but. the troop of sol :
diers faced their duty until all but seven perished in
the frost and tempest. It is plaintive and pitiful, but ;
heroic, that the few who lived forgot their frozen
feet and hands and faces and reported that through
out the march their military discipline was main
tained; every man obeyed his commander as long
as he could cling to life, and then saluted the stan
dard of his country and fell dead into bis sepulcher of
jMGyz. Xenophon and his ten thousand Greeks made
no more glorious record. Grecian pluck did not ex
cel the spirit of those patriotic islanders.
They are not imitators. They are ( original: They

i In the Chino-Japanese war an old father had sent
two sons to the army. After the , battles had beguri
one son wrote to him: "When brother and I joined
our regimient we promised each other that if either
met his death before reaching the gates of, Peking
the survivor should carry the dead .within the walls
of China's capital. But my brother is already slain
and we are yet far away from the great' city. In or
der to fulfill my vow I have cut-off a portion "of
brother's body,' which I carry, in my 1 cap,- so that
when Tenter the walled city his spirit will behold
and be glad." The old father read the letter and
smiled, saying, "Well done, my son." A widow sent
her only son to that patriotic war, and when news
came that he had fallen on the Manchu plains her
friends came to sympathize, but she repulsed them
gently, crying, "Widow ' though I am, I count it a
privilege to give' my only son to die for the honor of
his Emperor and his country."
That widow had never read:

THE SAN FRANCISCO f GALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 39, 1902.
THE LETTER CARRIER BILL
BOARDS OF .TRADE, Chambers; of Com-,
merce, banks, manufacturing establishments
and business men of all sections .of the Union
are said to have sent . petitions , to Congress urging
the passage of the bill -;to v classify and increase the
pay of better reamers. Â¦- As to the. press of the coun
try, it has been k well -nigh unanimous in ..approving
the measure, so that the advocates of the bill in: Conâ
gresshave had no, lack of support in their efforts to
do this amount of justice to one of. > the. .hardest
worked branches of the. public service. ,
Representative Smith of Michigan, who introduced
the bill, has recently, declared -himself well assured of
its favorable consfderation by the committee and : by
both the House arid < the "Senate. ".Speaking of its
objects he said: "The letter carrier starts in under
the present- law at $600 a year, having \ served .pre
viously sometimes from three to ;' four years as a sub-;
stitute before he is put on regularly. At the end of Â¦
four years, after he becomes a regular carrier, he can
get $1000 a ygar. As a rule we pay colored messen
gers and laborers in trie departments' better; than :we ;
do the letter carriers. The bill I have introduced in
creases the carrier's maximum pay to $1200 a , year,
and I think it is little, enough. A man or woman
can' be appointed to a clerkship in the departments .
at! $720 to $900 a year, and in two or three years, with
a little political influence, get up to $1600 or $1800.'
The letter -carrier , must serve anywhere from sixVto
eight years before": he can get $1006, arid that isjthe :
maximum. I. think the slightest consideration of the:
equity of these case's would show. the injustice to the'
letter carriers arid pass the bill. I think I am "not de-^
hiding, myself in believing ithat even without -any
recommendation from the Postoffic'e Committee, if?
ESPITE the vigor with which the advocates .
'of the Nicaragua route 'for an isthmian canal.
: .battle against the Iprdposed adoption .of the
Panama' route, there "is reason for believing the is
sue between the contestants .may be settled at this
session/of Congress and a way prepared for defer
minihg^a 1 route and_begihning; construction ' without
further^delay. It appears that while some members
of Congress -de'ejaref 01' "Nicaragua or "nothing," and
others are just as obstinate on the side of Panama, a
good working 'majority in. each House is willing to
accept a compromise and .to refer the selection of a
route to President Roosevelt. â¢
There can be little question that the country would
much prefer 'leaving the" choice to the President than
to run the; risk .of :a" deadlock, in : Congress with the
consequent postponement of work, for another ; year,
or perhaps, two years. The majority .of the people
desire the completion ; of a ,' waterway : as , speedily, as
possible' and are comparatively indifferent by whfch
route it is* constructed; so long as it is under control
of the United States "Government. .Nicaragua, Pan
ama and Darien has each its advocates, but all are
advocates of a canal, and there is ; a very . small proj
portion who would insist upon either route if. such
insistence would seriously- retard the attainment of
the object of common 'desire. '
Washington reports are to the effect that in the
Senate at least it is well nigh assured that the solu
tion of the controversy over the routes will be found
in referring the choicf ( to jthe ' - President Se*hator
Spooner has proposed to the House bill an amend
ment which-, provides, that* the* President shall con
struct the canal on the Panama route if it shall- be
possible to secure for $4O;oo"o,odo good and sufficient
title to the properties and franchises of the Panarria
Canal Company,' and if it also shall be possible to
secure from Colombia necessary Â¦ concessions for the
construction' of the canal. Should the President find
it impossible to acquire good title to the Panama
Canal Company's. property for $40,000,000, or, if hav
ing found no obstacle to the acquirements of a good
title from the canal company, it should be impos
sible to obtain from Colombia what is wanted in the
k shape of concessions,. it is provided that-the canal
shall "be built upon the Nicaragua. route. -. , ' 'Â¦
'*"" It' would * seem; ( that Â¦ suc.h an amendnient would be
satisfactory to all parties r who Â¦ are ; really desirous of
having a canal ' constructed and who are not seeking
opportunities to delay the enterprise: without incur
ring the odium of actually 'opposing it. Sooner or
later the. tissue will' come " home to the Nicaragua
men whether they would : not -sooner accept the
amendment than to adjourn without enacting a canal
bill, and the same issue will be presented to the Pan
ama men. With that question fairly before theni it
is not probable that a majority of the Senate /would
refuse the compromise 'offered them, j Should it be

LONG DISTANCE SABIN.
A MEDICAL' reader of The : Call traces some -
relation between cancer quackery and our,de
scription of a; cancer as resembling a rose in
form. - We were ' not informed as to the kind of
cancer Colonel Sabin cured by a simple turn of 'the
wrist of his mind,* .while Separated !"is,ooo miles from
the patient, and used the rose form as a figure of
speech, which we thought a justifiable license in view
of the figurative natureof Colonel Sabin's statement.
We are i aware that the scourge takes many forms,
determined, perhaps,- by \ the nature of the tissue in
which' it nests. ,^Biit : as . the'siibject is too serious to
have anything said upon it that -will mislead those
who -suffer. from the dreadful disease, or increase the
ravages of quacks,., we, leave .standing all ',â¢ we said
about Colonel Sabin and take down the rose
metaphor. 'â¢'...- .- Â¦ Â¦ *â¢
Since we commented upon Sabin"it ; is reported that
the cancer germ has been isolated and used success
fully in' inoculation. ' : If' this : be so it i raises again _ the
hope of the medical profession that the' disease may
be conquered. It is' not long since the bacteriolo
gists were baffled by the : conclusion that â¢ cancer Â¦ is
nqt/agerm disease, but the result of .some abnormal
aberration of cell growth. If; it be trueithat a; speci
fic germ i induces' and controls â¢ that aberration â¢ it
would seem that this enemy, of -the flesh is about to
be conquered and \ civilization, emancipated fro'mi one
of its major 'scourges. Â¦ -:.Â¦ 'â¢..Â»-
An evidence of' the wealthâ or at least , of , the , glit
terâof New' York is shown in the report that there
are upward of 300 firms' in "that city ' engaged in'' the
importation of precious stones." As much as;$20,000,
000 worth of diamonds alone has been 'Â¦Â¦ imported in
a single year,, and it is believed that 'about $7,060,000
worth is" smuggled in .'annually. Evidently the big

The Grand Jury held its regular session

Grand Jury Meets.
The v suit Just decided was instituted
when 'Assessor Dodge had made the col
lections â¢ for â¢ March, April, : May and June
of 1900, but there is on deposit in the city
treasury $31,299 60 to which he laid claim.
The sum of $8857 25, which ex-Treasurer
Brooks claimed as percentage on the col
lection of collateral inheritance taxes and
which he appropriated but returned to the
city pending the decision- in the Dodge
case, is also In the treasury and will be
turned over for the use of the munlcpal
ity. The Tax Collector Is interested to the
extent of about $5000 for fees granted by
the , statutes for compiling the - military
roll. Â¦ 1 - i
Chief Justice Â¦ Beatty writes Â¦ a long
dissenting' opinion. In which he says
he cannot see upon what grounds .a
law ..can . be .. defended , which assumes
to turn over 15 Â¦ per cent of the poll
taxes of â¢; the city and county of
San Francisco to the municipal salary
fund while .limiting the compensation oÂ£
the Assessor .to a fixed salary, .to be paid
whether he collects the tax or not. He ar
gues that a flat salary is really an induce
ment to the Assessor to be disinterested
in the collection of ; the poll taxes.'
The amount annually involved in the de
cision Is about $22,500. This sum, accord
ing- to City ; Attorney Lane, will revert to
the unapportloned fee. fund, and at the
end of each year will go Into the surplus
fund, to 1 be . appropriated as the Super
visors may see fit. v
Justice Beatty Dissents.
A former suit instituted by. District At
torney Fay of Kern County * and 'â¢Â¦ decided
by the Supreme Court is cited as a prece
dent. The constitution provides that the
District Attorney shall receive $10 for
each prosecution against delinquent pur
chasers of State lands. Fay, prosecuted
sixty-three Â¦ parties, but was not - able to
secure the $630 by reason of having acted
in his official capacity, for which he was
already pfcid... Dodge's contention Is said
to have less merit than Fay's.; The judg
ment and order of the lower court is re-'
versed and the dispute is thus ended.
The : opinion is written by Justice -Van
Dyke,' with whom Justices Harrison; Tem
ple, Henshaw and Garoutte directly con
cur. . Justice McFarland writes a concur
ring opinion, in which he suggests that as
the collection of poll taxes is so dlfticul t
the State should provide sufficient addi
tional compensation to' prove an incen
tive for determined effort on the part of
the Assessor.
The, court holds that t Dodge collected
poll taxes in his official capacity, and that
his salary ' therefore Â¦ compensates for his
services: The Assessor Is, according to the
provisions of , the . charter, compelled to
pay all moneys coming into his hands as
such officer, no matter from what source
derived or received, into the' treasury of
the city and county. : It is decided, in con
sequence, - that as his collections â¢ were
made in his official capacity as Assessor
all such funds belong, to the city.
Acted Only in Official Capacity.
- The new charter provides in reference to
the Assessor that "he shall receive an an
nual salary of $4000, which shall, be in full
compensation for all his services." Dodga
claimed /that his duties consisted wholly
in making collections on taxable property,
and that the. collection of poll taxes wad
not a part of such duty.
- It is explained in the opinion of the Su
preme-Court that this provision < does not
apply to. the question at issue." A' consti
tutional amendment provides - for the
strict accountability of county officers for
all public funds that may come into their
possession, but leaves the matter -Â«f fix
ing salaries and fees to the body politic.
The city -and county of San Francisco Is
held to . fall - within the limits of this
amendment. â¢'Â¦: /".'Â¦'
Court' Shows Error in Contention.
â¢: In July,M9O0,; Dodge tried to collect; the
sum as his rightful percentage on poll tax
collections ' made " during . the preceding
four Â¦.months.. The Treasurer_ refused to
turn over the money, and, the controversy
was i transferred to the courts."'- The ..As
sessor,' won in the . lower - court and the
case was appealed to the Supreme Court.
â¢Dodge based his claim of $14,080 60 on a
section in the Political" Code .which says:
"The "Assessor for- services: rendered in
the i collection , of ; poll taxes shall receive
the sum of 15 per cent, and the Collector
for services rendered ' in ' the collection of
poll-taxes on the delinquent list; Including
publication, . shall receive the sum of 26
per cent onfall delinquent poll taxes col
lected by him.? . > . ' - . .

that Â¦ the "Assessor of the city^ and county
of San ' Francisco Is not entitled ; to a per
centage on the amount'of poll-tax collec
tions. Assessor Washington Dodge there

Policeman Peters last night captured
j. v. O'Brien, a convict sentenced to six
years in San Quentin for cattle stealing,
who escaped from the cu -tody of a dep
uty Sheriff last week. ' ,e deputy had
brought hia prisoner t San Francisco
and was waiting at the New Western Ho
tel until time to catch the boat for San
Quentin. O'Brien was given permission to
eo to the lavatory, but failed to come
back. He might still be at large if he
could have controlled his appetite for
opium. He was captured in an alley
leading off Washington street, whither he
had gone to seek his opium-smoking
"Dais" of former days. The Sheriff of
Tehama County offered 5100 reward for
the convict's capture.

Enthusiasm and loyalty to a chief
marked the banquet to H.' P.- Thrall, su-
perintendent of the railway mall .service,
given by the clerks ot the eighth division
last evening at a downtown rotisserie.
The banquet was to give public expression,
of gratitude for many favors extended,
for the uniform and courteous treatment
shown to all in that particular branch of
the service, and also that his
co-workers might have the opportunity
In a body to congratulate their guest on
the growth and development of the serv
ice on the -Pacific Cpast. The committee
of arrangements had assured a unique
banquet, and even the orchestra which
rendered animated overtures and selec
tions had -been specially selected.
After full justice had been done the re
past R. J. Auld began the speeches by eulo
fc-izing Superintendent ThralL They had
gathered, he said, to show full apprecia
tion for a man who during his adminis
tration as superintendent of the railway
mail service Had done everything In his
power to elevate tbe department to a
ingh standard of proficiency. ' Thrall had
always treated them fairly and impartial
ly, ktndly and generously- Auld said he
voiced the sentiment of every clerk in the
service when he wished their guest every
success and prosperity-in the future. ,
The assemblage, numbering.', quite two
hundred, rose and for many ' minute?
cheered the honored sqperintendent.
Thrall, in responding to the good wishes
of his colleagues, said that he had from
the beginning laid down plans to secure
the clerks that recognition which was
their due. His policy had been a deter
mination that every one in the service
should be treated with justice. He was
proud of their standard of. efficiency,
which was attained by energy and . perse
verance. During seasons of unusual mall?,'
the result of unprecedented prosperity.
throughout the country, the clerks, hs
declared, had demonstrated that no finer
body of men nor more loyal men to the

After hearing the decision by Judge
Sloss i yesterday, afternoon â¢. In his . favor,
Samuel - W. Cheyney, who was sued by
Miss Maud Nevill for maintenance, she
claiming to be his wife, immediately went
over.; to' the clerk's office and secured a
license Vto. marry Miss Bessie Lee Wall,
who resides with her sister, Miss L..' Wall,
at .the Bella -Vista Hotel." The marriage
ceremony was performed last night by
Father Enos of. St. Mary's Church. It
was a quiet affair, the bride's family be
ing the only ones present besides the con
tracting parties. The couple leftfor the
East this morning and 'will 'be gone some
time.-'..
_.Miss Wall comes of Virginia stock. Her
father : and mother, who are now dead,
came to California in early days. Mr.
Wall was very well-to-do at one time,
having owned and operated several mines
in this State and owned a large amount of
real estate in Oakland. Through reverses
he was deprived of his wealth. Miss
Wall's sister is an artist of great ability;
Mr. ~ Cheyney is a . mining engineer of
wealth ana a member of the Paciiic-Union
Club. Â¦â¢..Â¦.. ' Â¦â¢Â¦ â¢
"Judge Sloss' decision disposes of Miss
Nevill's claim 'that she. was the wife of
Cheyney and is an acknowledgment of the
justness of the claim madeiby Cheyney's
attorney, Peter F. Dunne. ' that a. great
deal of the documentary evidence intro
duced on behalf of the fair plaintiff had
been tampered with in an endeavor to
Strengthen her suit.
. The Cheyney i case was on trial before
Judge Sloss 'for many weeks. From the
day of its commencement until its sub
mission to the court for decision it devel
oped sensational features, and was a con
tinuous expose of a life which' did not re
dound to the credit of either of the prin
cipals. ,-."-Â¦ .
, The trial developed testimony of a most
racy nature. Hundreds of letters written
by Miss Nevill and covering a period of
ten years were introduced In evidence, as
were also the replies to them by the min
ing man. . Mtes Nevill's letters were full
of passion and breathed undying love for
the handsome defendant. His epistles were
carefully written, and to his care in in
dicting his' love missives he perhaps owes
his success in the legal battle just ended.

OF INTEREST TO ALL WOMEN.
Coachman's Share of His
Uncle's Estate in
England. >
Special Dispatch to The Call.
! REDDING, Feb. IS.â The romantic -tale
of the good fortune' which" some strange
fairy was to bring Artell Greenwoo"d, the
Redding boy, who is now a coachman for
Mrs. Hearst in San Francisco, and who
was traced by The Call, has crystallized
into a simple story of .facts, which name
the source of the unexpected bounty and
show that the sum which Greenwood has
fallen heir to about $50,000. Dame For
tune remembers also his sister, Mrs. Hat
tie Palletser, of, Elmhurst, and she will
receive an -ectual amount.
Full details of the bequests have come
to Mrs. Aimle Greenwood j of this city,
Artell's stepmother, who had lost trace
of him. The estate in England is that of
John Greenwood, who recently died at
Farmouth. John, who was a brother of
Redding's pioneer shoemaker, Joseph
Greenwood, the father of' Artell and Hat
tie, owned a wide acreage of farming
land. About 100, acres had been divided
into lots and a town was built upon the
land. The value of the whole is not less
than $150,000. . There is one heir besides
Artell Greenwood i and his sister. He is
Edward Greenwood of Clinton, Mass, the
son of. a deceased brother of John and
Joseph Greenwood. Each heir gets one
third of the estate.
It appears that but for the boyish pho
tograph of Artell found among his uncle's
effects and through which he was traced,
he and his sister would have been over
looked altogether.

(From the Boston Herald).
;It!was my privilege recently to call upon
the world famous Mrs. Pinkham at Lynn,
Mass. I must confess ' that . among all
newspaper women there has always been
a great feeling that Mrs. Pinkham was a
myth; we' are so; u familiar with', advertis-'
Ing methods "wVgrow"to v b"e skeptical- and
always take such statements as are made
in the Pinkham, advertisements, as well as
all other advertising, with the proverbial
"grain of salt," but,' as before stated,'be
ing near the city of Lynn, Mass., I thought
I â would j investigate a '-. little \ in order to
satisfy my curiosity, and "I must say "I
was surprised at what I. found. .
To begin with I had no idea that the
Lydia iS. Pinkham establishment 'was
anything like the immense size that it is,
and when the street car stopped in front
of a great collection of buildings and the
conductor told me that it was the Lydia
E. Pinkham Laboratory, I should have
been sura he had made a mistake had it
not 1 been for a small sign which is on one
of -the original buildings. ; *
Upon entering the onice I was receiveQ
by- a .very courteous lady and was Very
much impressed by the .tact that all the
occupants of the room were women, and
although â¢ my sojourn in the buildings
covered something more than an hour vis
iting the entire place and private .office,
I saw nothing but women, and was also
pleased to learn that no man ever had
access to these rooms.; I was satisfied that
their claims that this Is strictly a wo
man's institution â¢ were altogether, truth
ful. . - . ,
After stating the purpose of my visit I
was introduced to Mrs. Pinkham, who
turned me over to a head assistant with
instructions that I was to be shown every
thing in and about '.the laboratory, and
particularly asked me to visit the "pri
vate letter department," which I did. This
is the department in- which are received
hundreds of thousands of letters from ail
ing women, and in which every, letter is
opened, carefully considered by . compe
tent â¢ persons : under Mrs. Pinkham's
guidance, and carefully . and accurately
answered by women-onlyâ so particular
is Mrs. Pinkham about having even, a sus
picion of. these letters going through a
business office where men are allowed, to
frequent that she will not allow a type
writer to be used, and every letter that
goes out of this' office is, written by hand
by women. I was also shown positive
evidence which clearly satisfied me on the
point that no letters are published unless
.the writer's special permission is first ob
tained. '- ' *Â¦ Â¦
> - To say that all this was a revelation ' Is
putting it mildly, and when I was shown
the great â¢ cabinet of files that contain
thousands upon thousands of letters, then,
and enly then, did I begin. to realize the
magnitude of Mrs. Pinkham's work. Just
think of it, every one of these letters has
been answered >. as carefully as . the ; most
competent ; knowledge , could . dictate, and
not ' one cent has ; ever; been charged for
advice. I saw where more than one million
sucli letters were ' filed, ; and I began :to
feel that this one woman was doing more
good among the eick^ women" of Ameri
ca than any combination - of men . and
women that I ever heard of. I . came
away - from Mrs." Pinkham's i Laboratory
feeling that it was my duty, to all women
to use my facilities as a newspaper writer
to assure them, that what I saw convinced
me that" Mrs., PinKham is more compe
tent to advise sick women than any, other
one person in^the United States.. The vol
ume of â¢Â¦ information . which' she has . col
laborated Â¦ during l the .-. last twenty years
contains a record of every kind of female
illness that a human being could possibly
develop, and r; nowhere .in "the * world
could Â¦ a woman get i more i accurate s and
helpful, advice; in regard .to. her. -illness
than by writing to Mrs. Pinkham at Lynn,
Mass.- I have . no , interest in Mrs. - Pink
ham ' or the Pinkham Medicine Co. , but I
have | a streak | of I humanity; in I my | make
up,; and I cannot ; rest without . unburden
ing =. my,: mind ; In , regard â¢, to â¢ this '-. matter,
and', every : time I see theifollowintr,para
graph- In a newspaper, I can hardly keep
from ?- baying : out loud^ while â¢ I :< am ; read
ing - v i(;_"every word of ' is ' true, . and
every, woman who Is ill and does not take
advantage i of iMrs. * Pinkham's advice i is
slowly committing, suicide."- .'The > para

male weakness are invited , to . freely com
municate - 'with i Mrs.- Pinkham Â¦ at i Lynn,
Mass. >,A11 1 letters -â¢ are r? received;- opened,
read r and answered vby ,women only." Thus
has been established the eternal confidence
between 9 Mrs. "Pinkham;- and the : women
of rAmerica which ' has , never been broken,
and, has I induced', more than' 100,000 suffer
ers 'i to r, write & her s for- \ advice Â» during , the

SCIENCE SCORES AGAIN.
A Preparation That Will Destroy tha
Dandruff Germ Discovered.
, Filially the scientific student has dis-
covered a â¢ certain remedy for dandruff.
When it first became known that dan-
druff is the result of a germ or parasite
that digs into the scalp, and saps the
vitality, of hair at the root,' causing fall-
ing hair and baldness, biologists set to
work to discover some preparation that
will kill the germ. After a year's labor
in one laboratory, the dandruff germ de-
stroyer was discovered; and it is now
embodied in Newbro's Herpiclde, which
besides curing baldness and thinning
hair, speedily and permanently eradicates
dandruff. "Destroy the cause, you re-
move the effect." ,
Nearly everybody seems to be taking Prof. Man
yon's Cold Cure whenever a cold appears. It
relieves the head, ncse, throat and longs so quickly
i that a cold need no longer be a forerunner of grippe,
diphtheria or pneumonia. A vial of the Cold Core
is like a life insurance policy. Every one of his
remedies is as sure. Mostly 25c. vial. -Guide to

NEW YORK STOCK LIST
NEW YORK, Feb. 18.â The restrictive Influ
ence on trading of yesterday's storm was lifted
to-day, yet the volume of trading was only half
a million shares. There was some show of
strength during the morning hours, but it dwin
dled during the day and the market generally
turned downward. Some stocks which had the
advantage of early advances did not suffer ma
terially on the day, but the general level of
prices at the end was lower than yesterday.
The disinclination to trade in stocks of the
greater railroad systems, especially those of the
Transcontinental group, was very marked. - It
might have been due to the efforts making for
a revision of transcontinental freight rates or
it might be explained by' the growing inclina
tion to await next Monday's session of the Su
preme Court and - a possible decision in the
Northern Securities Company case before ven
turing upon speculative commitments in this
group of stocks, which have so much at stake
in the decision of that case. Speculative opin
ion Is in a perplexed state as to the merits
of the Metropolitan Street Railway plan. The
machinery of the plan is so complicated and the
bearings of Its operation so obscure that little
can be made of it and the general public is in
clined to look askance at the securities In
volved. That the interest of insiders Is sup
porting the price of the stock pending the com
pletion of the plan is obvious, but the price
ran off more than a point in the late dealings
to-day. This had a deterrent influence on spec
ulation elsewhere. The same was true of the
weakness of Amalgamated Copper, which lost
2% in the day's dealings. The futility of- the
efforts to advance Southern Pacific and Sugar
were additional Influences in the same direction.
Another group which was active and strong was
the Southwesterns. Conjectures are rife of plans
looking to financial consolidation in this group
also. -Wide gains are made by a number of
usually inactive stocks,' the last previous sales
of which were many months old In some cases.
The money market remained easy, but confi
dence over its future is not fully assured. Ster
ling exchange advanced a fraction, here to-day
and fell a fraction at Paris. The margin of
profit of gold exports to Paris Is very narrow
and both these movements tended toward wip
ing out the margin. The firmness of London
money markets is an additional factor. This
ma'kes It possible that engagements of gold for
export on Thursday will be made to-morrow.
The growing dullness and heaviness in the
market was-due in part to this : development.
The dose was irregular, but there were only
slight rallies. Wabash debentures constituted
the bulk of the business in bonds, but they lost
practically all of their gains. Total sales, par
value, $5,300,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call. . ' Â¦ Â¦ . - .

EUREKA SUMMARY. â Very little farm
work done during the past -week. Rain continu
ous and general; rivers overflowing their banks
and flooding contiguous farms, but no mate
rial damage reported.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARY. â Except In
feme eastern valleys grain and gracs are suiter
ing badly for rain. Without timely and abun
dant rains there is little prospect for grain and
hey crops. Orange shipments are generally
act;\ - e. - .-.-"Â¦ '.-.Â¦",
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.â Generally clear,
cool weather has prevailed during the week,
with fogs in some sections and light sprinkles
of rain along the- coact. The fogs have been
bcnrficial to barley. and wheat, and fair, cross
ar? probable If the usual late rains occur. Con
ditions have been favorable for walnuts end de
ciduouF fruits. Irrigation has commenced In
orange and lemon groves, as the soil is becom
ing very dry. Late eown grain In San Diego
County continues in pood condition, and will
not suffer for rain for two weeks. Plowing and
seeding are prnjeressinff In some sections.
SAN JOAQCIN VALLEY.â Warm weather
has continued during the week. Rain has fallen
in nearly all parts of the valley, varying from
one inch in the northern counties to light show
ers In the south. From Fresno County north
ward the rainfall has been very beneficial, and
prain and feed are In good condition. Kern,
Kings and Tulare counties, and the lower por
tion of Fresno County, have received very little
rain during the season, and crops are in poor
condition; grain is reported as nearly ruined in
fsome places, and gTeen feed Is very scarce.
Grain and grass have made rapid growth in the
northern districts and plowing and seeding: con
tinue. Deciduous fruit prospects are reported
excellent. Pruning is nearly completed.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY. â Warm weather
and frequent heavy rains during the week have
been very beneficial to all crops, causing rapid
growth of grain and grass. In the vicinity of
Vacaville the rainfall amounted to over three
Inches for the week. Farm and orchard work
hjts been temporarily suspended, but no dam
age has been done by high water. Grain is In
excellent condition, and prospects are good for
hea\y crops. Green feed has never been more
plentiful. Stock is in prime condition. Vine
yards and orchards continue thrifty. The acre
age of deciduous fruits and grapes is being con
siderably increased in tome sections. Almond
trees are in full bloom.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS. â Warm
weather has continued during the week, and
crops have made rapid growth. Rain has fallen
in all sections, greatly benefiting grain and
pasturage. The central and northern counties
received heavy rainfall, retarding farm and
orchard work in some places, but causing no
damage. In the southern counties the precipi
tation -was much lighter, but of great benefit to
crops and feed. Grain prospects are very good,
especially In the northern dietrictc, and pastur
age is plentiful. Deciduous fruit trees are in
excellent condition, and give indications of
abundant crci>s. Almond trees are In bloom,
and prune and peach buds are swelling. The
hlgrh southwest vrlnd on Friday caused no ma
terial damage. â¢
Orchards and vineyards are looking well. Al
mond trees are in full bloom and peach and
prune buds are swelling in the" central and
northern counties. Deciduous fruit prospects
are excellent in nearly all sections. The prun
ing of trees and vines Is nearly completed.
From Fresno northward crop prospects con
tinue excellent. Grain has made rapid growth
and is in splendid condition. The outlook for
heavy crops of wheat and barley was probably
never better at this date. South of that point
there in considerable doubt of raising even a
fair crop of grain unless abundant rain comes
very soon, and the hay. crop is also reported in
danger. Green feed is plentiful in the central
and northern districts and stock are in prime
condition. Alfalfa is making good growth.
Plowing and seeding continue In some sections.
Irrigation water is reported scarce in portions
of the south.
GENERAL SUMMARY.â Warm weather has
continued in the central and northern portions
of the State during the week, but the tempera
ture has been elightly below normal in South
ern California. Heavy rains have fallen In the
Â£acramento Valley and nearly .all parts of
Northern California, with light showers in the
eouthern part of the San Joaquin Valley, the
â¢southern coast counties and Southern Califor
nia. The high southwest wind on Sunday
caused no material damage.

CHICAGO. Feb! ; 18.â Wheat had a dull and
narrow^ market. ' The range. was within half a
cent'andin the main the tone was fairly firm.'
News was generally bearish, but an unexpected '
firmness ' In . Liverpool ' cables based on talk . of
a grain import duty and on cold weather helped
the market ;here materially at: the, opening.
Trade was principally | among the locals; with
some small buying. and covering earlier.' St.
Louis was a seller here and though. there was
some improvement in the cash and export situ
ations a bearish feeling developed on the corn
slump and depressed prices. May opened un
changed to %c up at 78%@78%c, sold to 78%c,
dropped to 1 78c and closed steady, a shade up,
at 78%@78%c 'Â¦ . Â¦ " .. Â¦ - Â¦
Lower cables and professional selling started
a' slump in; corn that for a time, bid fair to
demoralize" prices. The favorable crop reports
from â¢ the . corn belt and a freer .movement
started some active selling. Commission house
buying and short covering for profits helped . a
rally late in the session. . May closed weak, .
%@%c lower at ei^gei^c. . ' , -
The . market Â¦ for ' oats : was extremely slow.
May closed .%@%o down at 43%c. i'>
Â¦ Provisions were dull and closed - steady after
a fairly strong opening. . May pork closed 2%c
up, lard a shade higher and ribs -a shade up.

the diplomatic negotiations for the evacu

With an equipment and experience right
up with the best of the time, he came
out to San Francisco in the early sixties,
where his uncle. Dr. E. Cooper, had long
stood in the front rank of his profession,
and associated with him soon began to
lay the foundation of fame as a' surgeon
Dr. Lane was born in the year 1S33, and
after graduating, with his Master's de
gTee at Union College, Schenectady.X.Y.,
he entered Jefferson Medical College of
Philadelphia, one of the foremost institu
tions of the day. He graduated with hon
ors from that school in 1831, and later at
tended several schools and hospital
courses in Europe.
Dr. Lev! Cooper Lane was a nephew of
Dr. E. Cooper, one of the most famous
surgeons of San Francisco's early days.
In whose memory he called the gTeat med
ical Institution to whose founding and
maintenance he gave so much of his time
and substance.
and for the twenty odd years following
continued to fill that position, until some
two years ago, when â¢ failing health de
manded his retirement from active duty
in the lecture rooms.
The Lane Hospital, established six rears
ago,- and called after the eminenfsur

irlenos and associates, is another exand
monument to Dr. Lane's high standing

tinents.
In 1875 he was made a member of tte
Royal Chirurgical Society of Great Brit
ain and was also elected to membeship in
other societies, both at home and
abroad.
Dr. Lane's whole life was one of con
stant effort for the enlargement of knowl
edge in his profession, and the lessening
of the ills and sufferings of humanity.
This desire, in part, found practical and
permanent manifestation in the founding
of the great medical school with which
he was so long identified. The project
was conceived not long after the death
of his uncle. Dr. Cooper, whose name
and fame he with grateful heart deter
mined to mark in this manner.
To this end he put by each year in sa
cred trust a most generous part of the
large income gained by his eminent abili
ties in his practice, until in the late 70's
the sum in hand was sufficient to start
the enterprise/
The organization was effected and in
due time the magnificent structure known
as the Cooper Medical College reared its
imposing: dimensions on the corner of Sac

Senator. Morgan asked a series of ques
tions . regarding the ; floods and conditions
of the Chagres River, on the â¢ Panama
route.. Colonel Ernst said the water rose
39.3 feet above low water in 1879. Injflfty
years there had been | four floods of over
thirty .'feet. Such floods,- he said, would
cause considerable risk and contingencies
in the construction of the Bohlo dam. Po
lice :Â¦ and sanitary control of Panama
would be necessary, he said, should the

..'As a member of the commission he -was

Panama route 1 in the first report -of the
commission had the : offer of ttie Panama
Canal Company to sell; for 140,000,000 been
made at that -time, 1 and for the following
reasons: The Panama route was shorter,
straighter, lower/having four locks as
against eight for Nicaragua, and wouid
cost $1,350,000 less per -year to maintain
and operate. ' .'â¢. Â¦' Â¦ :
Colonel Ernst said there. were difficulties
in both routes. The Bdhio dam on the
Panama" route was more difficult than the
Concuda dam on the Nicaragua route, but
the clay banks on the latter route were a
difficulty that would .have to be overcome.
The healthfulness. of Nicaragua- was bet
ter than Panama, but by sanitary and po
lice regulations the conditions in Panama
could be improved. ' . . ' Â¦
Colonel Ernst' did not agree with other
witnesses that silt in the Chagres River
would ever be ~ a serious menace to., the
Panama canal. The difficulties in the con
struction of the Bdhio dam, he said, could
be overcome. He ssid that Insurance rates

minutes. Senator Wellington- spoke to
day in opposition to the pending bill and
Senator Stewart of Nevada in support of
the measure. ; ' . i- \'.-' -\

his well-known views forcefully. He al

own condemnation. Nevertheless, he (Gil

to a foreign country. During the course
of the speech two Democrats, Robinson of
Indiana and Thayer of Massachusetts, dis
claimed any sympathy with Wheeler's ut

that he desired to share in the responsi

The report of the committee on reduc
tion of representation in the congress of
the Daughters was presented by the chair
man, Mrs. Katharine W. Verplanck, of
New York. The subject is one of the most
important before the congress. Without
making recommendations, the committee
announced that a majority of twenty-six
State regents favored chapter representa
tion and a minority favor the ratio rep
resentation of one delegate to every 250
members. The voting, according to tho
report, resulted: For representation bjr
one delegate to the congress to every 250
in the State, 8 regents; representation In
the congress of each and every chapter
by its regent or alternate, irrespective of
the size of the chapter, 26 resents.
Miss Richards' amendments were then
taken up and a debate on their adoption,
limited to five minutes to each speaker,
was participated in by a number of tha
delegates. The debate occupied two
hours, when Miss Richards announced
that she recognized that those who stood
with her for the amendments were In a
hopeless minority and she would accept
defeat gracefully. The chair was about
to declare a recess, when Mrs. Donald
McLean of New York made a vigorous at
tack on the parliamentary procedure of
the president general and insisted that tnÂ»
vote on the amendments was next in or
der. Mrs. Fairbanks Insisted on the re
cess against a number of protests. Th-i
Richards amendments were overwhelm
ingly defeated at the afternoon session.
Miss Janet RIcharda of this city, who
framed the proposed amendment, sub
mitted an amendment to her amendment
which brought on a lively discussion.
Several delegates in vigorous remarks
pointed out that they had had no time to
consider the new amendment, whicii
changed Miss Richards' former amend
ment so as to add a regent for each State,
one regent at large and one for every 150
members in the State. A number of mo

that the Canadian Government intends ;tu

to the ruins of the, Russian settlement at
Fort Ross, which was established in 1812.
The octagonal towers of the fort are still
excellently 'Â¦ preserved .'. and the old f build
ings . offer â¢ varied attractions ' to . tourists.
It was pointed out as a significant -fact
that had the -Russian Government insist
ed upon j its ' rights at the . time Â¦' of the
evacuation ; of the fort by the ; Russians
in 1842 the entire history of the State
might have been changed. -

BEVERAGE.
Explanation by Physician.
The high grade physician always stands
ready to guide one's 'habits and prevent
disease, even if by that means he loses
many a fee.
Food and drink are important factors
relating to health.
Dr. Wm. R, Blackwood, - Â£52 North
Twenty-third street, Philadelphia, Pa.,
writes on the subject and remarks about
the need of some warm drink for break-
fast, but deprecates the use of coffee be-
cause of its effect upon the health. He re-
fers to the fact that the heat of a warm
breakfast beverage is important in caus-
ing the necessary alvine evacuation which
should invariably follow breakfast.
"Personally I had been quite nervous
from overwork for a time, and neither
coffee nor tea seemed to agree with me,
consequently I looked around for some
other pleasant breakfast beverage, for a
long time without success, until I got hold
of the article under .consideration (Pos-
tum).
"This proved pleasing to the taste and
was also very strengthening. Its flavor is
so nearly that of a really good coffee as
to completely take its place after begin-
ning its habitual use. I attach much im-
portance to that word 'habitual,' for if
you desire to have all of the benefits cen-
tered in this article you must stick to it
right along. I have proved to my own
satisfaction that Postum is all right if
persevered In.
"Some of my acquaintances and pa-
tients have taken up Postum and after a
first trial abandoned Its use; then some
have afterward formed the habit of drink-
ing it when shown how really simple the
preparation is, which results in a flne cup
of Postum containing nutritive elements."
The doctor mentions, in confidence, two
cases of- severe prostration from alcohol-
ism which were ultimately cured and tne
patients restored to health through his
treatment and taking away all whisky,
coffee and tea and giving them In place j
Postum Food Coffee.
The doctor concludes his letter with this .
statement: "Believing that a letter from
a physician, who has studied dietetics
many years in different climate* . and
among different races, would be of some
value, I write to do what I can to fur-
ther the use of this efficient product,
which surely must be of great advantage
to invalids as well as to the general com-,
Â¦munlty."

BATTLE CREEK, Mich., Feb. IS -The
Kellogg, or Seventh Day Adventists* san
itarium here, which was located on a hiH
at the highest point in the city, was de
stroyed by fire early to-day and the prop
erty loss is estimated at from $300,000 to
J4CO.C0O.
So far as can be learned, there was only
one life lost among the 400 people in t&e
sanitarium. Abner Case, aged 83 years.
Is missing. Ira B. Sankey, the evangelist,
was an inmate,. but escaped by climbing
down a lire escape. Mrs. H. O. Dan
iels of Eldorado, Ark., is the only per
son who was seriously injured. ,' 3ha
Jumped or fell troin the tire escape at thÂ»
third story and sustained a broken leg.
The fire started in the bathroom of the
sanitarium building, probably about tha
furnace. A still alarm was turned in, but
the first company of firemen called could
not cope witrt the flames, which! shot up
the elevator shaft to the roof like rocK
ets. A general call was sent in, but the
lire was beyond control. The water pres
sure was low and this added to the handi
cap of the firemen, as the sanitarium
stood on a hill. In two hours the build
ing was in ruin3 and the hospital was
nearly destroyed. â¢
It 13 almost miraculous that the 400
sleeping inmates escaped with their lives.
Watchmen darted through the corridors
awakening them when the fire was dis
covered. Few of them had time to gather
together any clothing, escaping in their
night clothes. The corridors soon filled
with smoke and about half of the patients
were compelled to make their way down
the fire escapes.
Mrs. Daniels, who was injured, was on
the fifth floor. She was awakened by the
cry of fire and rushed to the fire escape
on ihe fourth floor. She got down safely
as far as the third story, when she either
jumped or fell. She is resting easily and
is in no danger. Mrs. Gillingham of At
lantic City, N. J., describing her escape,
said:
"I was In my room on the fifth floor,
when the nurse rushed to the door crying
lire. The electric lights were going then,
but they soon went out and we were in
darkness, but for the flames which rushed
from the tower above our heads. My
aged husband was on the floor beneath,
me and had to go down the fire escape, as
did I. He was guided by a nurse and es
caped safely. Scores of people were on
the escape coming from all parts of the
buiMlng,.- and it is a wonder that none
of them was killed." ?
NEW YORK, Feb. IS. â Miss Alice Morton,
daughter of Former Vice President Morton,
was married to-day to Wlnthrop Rutherford In
Grace Episcopal Church. The ceremony
was performed by the Rev. W. R. Huntlrwton,
rector of the church, who was assisted by
Bishop Potter. . - â¢

Schussler waa questioned with the ob
ject of ascertaining if the expense of sup
plying* water to the farmers of Alameda
County Â¦ by ' the Suburban Company Â¦ was
charged ". to , the consumers . of San Â¦ Fran
cisco . in ' the water . rates.". Schussler Â¦Â¦ de
nied that such was the case, but said that
the water, was supplied to the farmers in
stead'of paying outright for the water
rights . acquired . by the company. Â¦ ,
-Supervisor Brandenstein, who was ap
pointed to interrogate for the board, re
quested Schussler to furnish a statement
of the properties acquired and the moneys
expended in construction .work : by the
Spring Valley Company in the 'Alameda
Creek system since the last investigation.
Schussler he'.d . that it would not be fair
,to figure rates. on the cost of any -work,
as it was the duty.ot theBoard of "Works
to appraise the Alaraeda properties owned
by the company. , City, Engineer Grunsky
stated that the. company ; had failed to
furnish a list ,of Â¦ the properties and no
appraisement i-v/as possible. .
Schussler finally agreed to prepare . .i
statement of tbo cost of the Alameda sys
tem. Brandenstein then changed 'the line
of inquiry in an : .endeavorto,flnd If â¢ any
of the properties listed as assets by tho
company are not now, in actual -use. The
board then adjourned until to-night, when
the investigation of gas rates . will - be
commenced. Â¦ ' . .
The financial statement for the calendai

ceipts ot the company were <l,S72,710 32 and

Suburban Vvater Company, or Alameda
county, an adjunct oi tne Spring VaUey
Company, was supplying water to the city
of San Francisco und tnat its orncera and
books should be examined. Kellogg named
some -of the ofticers and directors of the
company and- sida that the Suburban
Company Â¦ is . furnishing : the Spring Valley
Company with -water under contract.
Schussler explained mat the properties of
the flrst named companyhad not been In
cluded in the valuation of previous years
because it was not deemed advisable to
make ' the . Information ; public. ' . A Â¦Â¦ resolu
tion was adopted directing the Suburban
Water Company to furnish an itemized

'lhe Board of Supervisors met last night
to examine into" the affairs of the Spring:

Enlisted men. men on furlough and dis
charged soldiers numbering several hun
dred disembarked, from the transport
Meade yesterday and stories of a rebel
lious scene enacted at Honolulu on the
arrival on the Meade at that port, com
plaints against Captain H. Tupas,. who"
had command of the men, expressions of
dissatisfaction wi.th the rations and dis
tinct and uncomplimentary murmurs re
garding the sleeping accommodations
aboard and, also, a scanty supply of tables
ana chairs at meal time, were matters tnac
i;ei>t ptopie on tne uotii niucii interested
tut some Hours while the customs officers
vere inspecting the belongings of tne sol
diers ana ex-soldiers. ,
Joseph Lynch, a discharged man of the
Seventeentn Infantry, was, like many
others, extremely bitter in his Uenuncia-.
tion of the food and the accommodation af
lorded the men. At Honolulu, said l^ynch,
enlisted men and discharged men oroke
through tne guard ana many climbed
oown the cables because Captain Tupes
had refused permission to land. Believing
he had no right to interfere with the free
dom of the discharged men, they took the
matter of landing into their own hands.
On returning to the transport some of the
men were put in irons. Lynch saj'3.
Harry Jones, discharged, late of the
Thirty-third Infantry, said that the main
body aboard was made up of "casuals."
At rlrst the captain gave orders that they
should do guard duty, which, he said, was
contrary to military rules, for the reason
that those men were discharged. The
"casuals" refused to obey the order and it
was revoked. At Honolulu men got down
ropes and cables and others rushed the
guard until fully 2u0 lauded. It cost some
of them a few days in the "brig."
Captain H. Tupes was not inclined to
say anything for publication, but admitted
that there is an order ia existence from
the SecretrLry of War prohibiting sol
diers or ships' crews going ashore at in
termediate points between Manila and the
United States. The captain had under his
command more than 400 discharged sol
diers and he construed the order as ap
plying to them as much as to the enlisted
men, his object being to avoid any possi
bility of quarantine. Captain Tupes had
not heard a word of dissatisfaction at his
enforcement of the order from any but
the discharged men. All short-term and
furloughed men behaved themselves well.
He denies having- received a single com
plaint about the rations or accommoda
tions aboard.
Captain George Wilson, master of the
Meade, said with regard to the preven
tion of discharged Boldfers landing at in
termediate ports that they were in reality
steerage passengers. The same rule ap
plies to them as to steerage passen
gers on the regular liners. If those
men were allowed to go ashore, said
the captain, many would go Into the
lowest dens and there would oe a chance
of bringing some infection to the vessel.
In answer to a report that had got about
that there was a serious outbreak of some
kind aboard, which was being kept a se
cret, the captain emphatically denied that
there had been anything more than sev
eral cases of dysentery, to which two sol
diers had succumbed. On every point he
contradicted the accusations of the dis
charged men. s
E. H. Fitzhugh. who came to this city
from the East last summer to fl'l the posi
tion of assistant to Charles M. Hays of
the Southern Pacific, was appointed the
early part of this month vice president
and general manager of the Central Ver
mont Railway. This is the position he re
signed when became to San Francisco.
The announcement of the appointment
of Mr. Fitzhugh came to this city in the
form of an official circular with the name
of Charles M. Hay* at the bottom.: At
the "yellow building" the circular was
handed around with much amusement,
and the laugh was hearty over the idea
that President Hays, though now the ex
ecutive head of another read, still clings
to his custom of â¢ making startling an
nouncements through the medium of of
ficial circulars.
When Charles M. Hays came to fill the
position of president of the Southern Pa
cific he made a host of officials pass many
sleepless nights, all owing to his pet fad
of issuing circulars. These circulars did
not come regularly, but were published at
unusual intervals. Â¦
E. H. .Fitzhugh. is a personal friend of
Charles M. I^ays, and on his arrival' in
San Francisco made himself very prom
inent by acting and talking in a myste
rious manner. He became very unpopu
lar because of peculiar actions. He .would
ride in an inspection \ car for days at a
time with division superintendents and
engineers without saying a word, which
was very embarrassing to the S ! railroad
men, as they, did not know whether Fitz
hugh was pleased or not with": their work.'

lows: * - ; â¢ i 'Â¦:

buying pianos
The average person is absolutely ignorant of the qualities of a good
piano.
They are "in the dark" when it comes to choosing an instrument.
Â¦ W*?" 1 you know that a piano can be. made to sell for any sum be-
tween 575 and $1000 you can understand the risks a buyer runs, for all
pianos look about alike, and, at first, sound about alike.
You don't know whether you are paying $100 too much or not.
Now, we are practical piano-makers.
One of the members of our firm waits on each customer personallyâ
we are mechanics, we will explain to you the mechanism of every instru-
ment, tell you why some pianos cost more than others.
We will instruct you so that no matter where you buy you will b<"
able to buy intelligently, to know what you are talking about and whether
) or not you get a bargain.
No one is asked to purchaseâ all we*want is an opportunity to pre-
sent our case, a chance to explain to you the details of piano construe--
) tion. â¢ . .
We are the oldest and largest piano concern on the coast. Our only r
competition .-is 'the record of our own past. Our guarantee is a positive 1
protection to every purchaser and -our.; experience and practical knowl-v-
edge of the piano business are points for your careful consideration...
