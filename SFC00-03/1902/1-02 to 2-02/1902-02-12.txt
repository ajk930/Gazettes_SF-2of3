WHOSE FINGERS CLOSED IN A DEATH CLUTCH ON THROAT OF NORA FULLER
Ti.HE.work of establishing the identity t of the foul fiend who strangled little Nora Fuller to .death; in- the house; at: 221 1 Sutter street is still baffling the police. The strangler whose brutal
fingers cruelly shut off the life of his girlish victim masqueraded under so many names it will .be;almost.impossible to trace: him. Attorney Hugh Grant, at his own request, was shown
yesterday to the people who had dealings with the strangler while he was plotting his hellish -crime,;^nd they all agreed without hesitation that the attorney was not the man.

THE preliminary steps toward holding
a Coroner's Inquest into the cause of
death of Eleanor Fuller, the young
girl %vho was mysteriously murdered
in the house at 2211 Sutter 6treet,
were taken yesterday morning. Cor-
oner Leland swore in the jury and
then took the members of that official
body upstairs to the autops=y room and
j-howed them the -body of the murdered
girl. They asked a number of questions
In regard to the marks on the girl's throat
and were enlightened by Dr. Leland. They
were then escorted to the police property
clerk's office, where they examined -the
bed, mattress and clothing taken from the'
house of mystery. Later the jury, a.ccom-|
panied by members of the- press 'and De
tective Hamill, went to 2211 Sutter street
and made a minute examination of the
premises. Thefirst thing' the jurors no
ticed as they ascended the narrow, stairs
was that some one. had' removed .-, the
number of the house. Once inside, the
dwelling, they moved from room to room
in" the hope of finding a' tangible ; clew/
Attorney Hugh C. Grant, at his own
request, was taken by Detective Dillon
yesterday to several places mentioned tn
connection with thl murder of Eleanor
Fuller for purposes of identification. The
first place visited was the Popular Res
taurant, on Geary street, where Bennett
made the appointment to meet the mur
dered girl. Grant was confronted by Pro
prietor Krone and the young lady cashier.
They declared that Grant did not resem
ble Bennett and that they had not seen
him, there before. A visit was also made
to the Standard Furniture Company, at
850 Mission street, where Grant was con
fronted by the men who sold the furnitura
to Bennett. B. T. Schell, the salesman,
and Larry Gillen, the driver, unhesitating
ly declared that they were unable to
recognize him as the man to whom Schell
had sold the furniture or the one to whom
Gillen had delivered it at the house at
2211 Sutter , street. Grant expressed himÂ«
self as satisfied after passing through the
two ordeals that he had been cleared or.

[ACH day that passes contributes ad
ditional mystery to the movements
of the fiend who strangled Nora
Fuller. All sorts of theories are be
ting advanced, but nearly every prob
able explanation of the motive and
the details of how the crime was com
mitted are shattered by some circum
stance which . readily disproves them.
The police are practically at sea. In
the history of crime in,this city the de
tectives have never had to deal with a
fmore j perplexing murder. The famous
Durrani case was a matter of easy solu
tion- when compared with the mystery
surrounding the strangling of Nora Ful
ler. In the Durrant case the Identity of
the murderer was known within a few
hours after the finding of the dead bodies
of his victims, and all that remained for
the police to do was to unearth the evi
dence that would fasten the crime upon
him.
The.inquest over the body of the mur 7
dered'girl was commenced yesterday. The
identity of John Bennett, alias C.B. :
Hawkins, alias Scott, is' still a mystery,
upon which yesterday's developments
threw.no light. .â¢ Â¦â¢
Grant Is Under. Fire.
The character and habits of Attorney.
Hugh Grant, who knew Nora Fuller in
her iif etime and who bought her a dress
shortly before her disappearance,' are be
ing thoroughly threshed out by a morning
paper, - but ' the j fact remains that Hugh
Grant is not the man who met Nora Ful

scar, "but it seemed to. me to be higher

.Attention was next ' turned to the .vac

Mrs. Fuller soon pointed it out.jBut the
most painful ordeal was yet to CQme.
. "Does that .look .like your daughter's
hair, Mrs. asked the deputy, as
he .slightly^ uncovered the forehead and
side of the face. ":
"That ' is her ear," said Mrs. Fuller.
"There is a scar on it. See? And that is
her : hair, too. Oh, j it was so bright and
golden -when the sun shone on it!"
Then the placid brow and the eyes and
the nose were exposed. Mrs. Fuller could
stand it no longer.
. "It is my daughter! It is my child! It is
my Nora!"
The pent-up grief and anxiety were re
lieved by a copious flow of tears, as Mrs.
Fuller sank exhausted in a chair which
had . been provided for just such emer
gency. - Detectives . and reporters turned
their heads. away, and many an eye was
moistened in silent sympathy with the
mother's grief.

"Leave Â¦ me alone , with my child, my
daughter, my dear little Nora,". she cried.
But Miss Tierney, the Morgue matron,
and Mrs. Fuller's friends kindly led her
away from the body. In a few minutes
her composure was restored and she paid
a visit to Captain of Detectives Seymour.,

Several letters found at the Sutter

general postoffice have no record of hav

"Mr. and Mrs. C. B. Hawkins" at 2211

and Captain Seymour detailed Detective
T.P. Riordan on the case yesterday, and
Superintendent Cox gave the officer every
facility at the general postoffice. Realiz
ing the importance 1 of the investigation;
Mr. Cox gave Detective Riordan* a letter
to Superintendent A. Tyler of Station F
postofflce^ requesting that everything
should be ; done to aid the officer !n his
Inquiries. Riordan then visited Isadore
Coleman Levey, the postman who deliv
ered: the letters addressed "C. B. Haw
kins, Esq., 2211 Sutter street," and "Mrs.
C. B. Hawkins."
Levey was unable to throw any . light
on the mystery. He had neither seen nor
heard any one at the Sutter-street house.
Not getting a reply to his repeated ring
ing of the bell he pushed the. letters' he
had to deliver under the door.
At the Golden West Hotel, from -where
the letters were redirected, inquiries were
made, but all knowledge of them was
disclaimed. '

Mrs. M. H. Hernan of 172S Lyon street
made a statement to the police yesterday
in which, she says she was sent by- a
clerk in Umbseh's real estate office dur
ing the latter, part of January to inspect
the house at '2211 Sutter street, he think
ing that it was vacant. She positively
declares that at that time she noticed
lace curtains over the windows in the
front rooms- of the-house. She is equally
positive that people .were living in the
house batween January 31 and February 6.
*â¢ Airs. ; - Hernan says that she cannot ex
actly remember the ' date when she. was
sent to 2211 Sutter, street, but beforer ring
ing the front door bell she noticed the
lace curtains over the front windows in
the upper part of the house. After ring-
Ing the bell several times and not getting
an answer Mrs.- Hernan concluded' that
the occupants were out. That night she
told her husband that Umbsen's clerk
had given her the number of a house that
was still occupied. The next morning
Hernan went to the real estate office and
said that the house was not vacant. The
clerk insisted that it was and on Monday,
February^ 3,. Mrs.' Hernan paid another
visit to the place. The lace curtains were
still up. On .February 6 Mrs. Hernan paid
a third visit to' the house .and was ac
companied by . Mrs. ' Day of 1730 - Lyon
street. They found '.the blinds drawn and
after, ringing' the 'bell- several times "and
not, receiving an answer they leffin dis
gust.

he purchased the bedding at Cava
naugh's. Vance says the man asked to
be shown some cheap articles of furni
ture. The man thought the price Vance
asked for the articles was too high and
he did not make any purchases. Vance
is a keen observer. He remembers the
incident distinctly and he has furnished
the police one of the best descriptions of
the strangler that has been given them
by anybody who had dealings with him.
Vance talked with the strangler several
different times and in addition he states
positively that he saw the man on Mission
street not more than ten days ago. Cap
tain Seymour is inclined to place great
credence in Vance's story. It has caused
him to believe that the strangler may be
still In the city. -
May Be Bennett
The police have discovered that on the
night of January 11 a man registered at
the Golden West Hotel under the name
of B. C. Bennett. He gave his place of
residence as Port Costa, but further than
that nothing of his identity is known by
the hotel people. . .
Attorney Grant was brought down to
police headquarters yesterday morning
and again questioned by Captain Sey
mour. Grant was asked if he ever knew
a man named Bennett, and he answered
that he did. He said that he once tran
sacted some legal business for a printer
named George L. Bennett, but it was
years ago. The . Bennett in question
proved to be a respectable citizen living
at 224 Broderlck street. He called volun
tarily at police headquarters last evening
and satisfied Chief Wittman and Captain
Seymour that he had no connection with
the case. ,
Traveled Under Aliases.
The detectives are satisfied that the
names the strangler gave to the different
people he spoke to in carrying out his
horrible plans are fictitious. It is quite
unlikely and unnatural that a man bent
on committing such a heinous crime as
he had in view would be so Indiscreet as
to give â¢ his right name. Although the
strangler dropped - into the Popular res
taurant for hi3 meals off and on' for
some years back F. W. Krone, the pro
prietor, did not know him by a name until
mysterious murderer the suspicion that
Grant is the man has been eliminated.
However, there is a well defined belief
among those Interested in the solution of
tiie mystery that Hugh Grant may not
be telling all he knows. There are cir
cumstances in connection with the FuN
ler girl's association with Hugh Grant
which might aid in establishing the iden
tity of her murderer. A theory is ad
vanced that Nora Fuller met her mur
derer in one of the many visits she paid
to- Attorney Grant's office or that Grant
heard the murdered girl speak of the fiend
with whom she 'was on friendly terms be
fore she vras taken to the house on Sutter
street and brutally strangled. Many un
savory things are said of the attorney,
but unless he Is connected in a more
tangible way with the horrifying- crime
they have no plape in the story of Nora
Fuller's murderi \
Saw Strangler and His Victim.
Chief cf Police WIttman and Captain
Seymour aro straining every energy to
solve the mystery. All day yesterday the
police officials were closely questioning
people who either came or were sum
moned to police headquarters- to tell what
they knew of the crime that threatens l<a
go down In the records of unsolved mur
der mysteries.
Charles Long, a saloonkeeper at the cor
ner of Taylor and Turk streets, called on
Captain Seymour yesterday and stated
that himself and his barkeeper, whose
name is Woodcock, saw Attorney Grant
and a girl answering Nora Fuller's de
scription on Taylor street about four
weeks ago.
John Chapman of 899 Capp street added
a mite to the mystery by stating that on
or about January 16 he accidentally bump
ed into a man accompanied by a young
girl on Market street near Brook. Chap
man noticed the pair very carefully and
is positive that the girl was Nora. Fuller.
Police Get Another Clew.
- A. W. Vance, proprietor of a furniture
store at 864 Mission street, held four
lengthy conversations with the supposed
strangler about the time he was scouring
the second-hand stores on Mission street
In search of the furniture found in the
room where the girl was murdered.
Vance Is positive that he talked -with
the same man who bought the bedding at
Cavanaugh's.
Vance's suspect answers the description
of the murderer In every particular. He
came into Vance's store on the same day
Coleman opened. the door of the house
and Mrs. Fuller entered. She seemed
dazed, and, after looking at " the f bare
walls for a moment again expressed the
belief that her daughter never entered the
house voluntarily. She is inclined to be
lieve that Nora was" murdered somewhere
else and her body was placed In a sack
and carried to the Sutter-street house.
The detectives have been kept busy
running down clews growing out of the
similarity of appearance of several people
to the man who bought the furniture.
"When the police once get the strangler in
their tolls they believe that it will be an
ea3y matter to fasten the guilt upon him.
Mrs. Fuller was taken yesterday to the
house where her daughter was murdered.
Detective Colenian was â¢ detailed .=_ to ac
company her. Upon arriving at the place
the broken-hearted mother looked at It
steadily for a moment' and then said:
"No, my daughter was not murdered
here." : ' ?â¢ â¢ â¢ ...â¢â¢;
This is . one feature . of the mystery
which is a stumbling block in the way
of establishing the identity of the mur
rturer. There are any number of people
in the city who fit the description of the
man who masqueraded under the name
of John Bennett, C. B. Hawkins' and
Scott. .

says the man had his face concealed^in

man, anxious to avoid contact with, every
one. He asked for food in an unnatural
voice and as soon as it was given him he
ran rapidly away, lopking bade over his
shoulder as if in fear of pursuit. He was
seen by several farmers and had evidently
come from Llvennore and was headed foi
the Sierra Nevada foothills. , Several
times when he saw people approaching
him on the road he jumped a fence and
ran through the fields.
One farmer, who was driving with his
family,' - met the supposed insane man in
the road. The fellow raised his mask and
took one look at the approaching rig and
then broke and ran across the fields. ThÂ«j
farmer drove back home, got his saddle
horse and a gun and started out to cap
ture him. No one saw the fellow again
The man's conduct was at- the time
thought to be simply that of an insane
man, but since he disappeared the farm
ers are speculating as to whether his ac
tions were not feigned.

I saw on that date wore that clothing.
As I remember her, she had a sort of
reddish hair, which was comf^ed up on
her forehead. My friend and I remarked
at the time that she was a pretty girl.
She appeared to be - between 15 and 16
years of age and Just budding Into wom

was with her was about 5 feet 8 or 9
inches in height, weighed between 150 and

walk. He wore a Prince Albert double

that is the body of the girl I saw with

A delegation from the Mission Road Im
provement Club waited on Mayor Schmitz
yesterday to urge him to' take favorabla
action on the proposition to accept Mis
sion road, from Crescent avenue to the
county line. This course is necesgary, aa
under the laws of the municipality the city
cannot spend any money to Improve a
street unless It has been accepted. The
delgation was reinforced by a deputation
from the executive committee of the Mis
sion Federation of ImDrovement Clubs.'
The delegation consisted of W. R. Pease,
president of the Mission Road- Club; Max
Popper. A. S. Lillie, George Center, Jo
seph Fassler, W. Hulme, J. Gilfeathen
and A. Luttringer. : *
The Mayor was informed that' prelim
inary steps had been taken by the Board
of Works to repave the street, the con
tract having been awarded after, the in
vitation of bids. The city had appropri
ated the sum of $15,000, and $7500 had been,
raised among property-owners for the im
provement, $5300 of that amount belngr
now in the city treasury. The contract
price was 129,000. but the contract had to
be rescinded because the street was not
accepted.
Commissioner Casey of the Board of
Public Works favored accepting the street
in crder to go ahead with the work.' but
exacted < a promise that the Board of Su
pervisors be urged to appropriate funds
in the next, budget to pave the road on
College Hill. Mayor Schmitz also ap
proved the plan, and the Board of Super
visors will undoubtedly pass an ordinance
accepting the street. ..--.- -

Parrish Is sure that the man departed
for the Orient on January 11. He was
not in the city when the steamer sailed,
but one of his clerks, a man named Par

wharf and bade him good-by. Parrisb.
states further that the name of Nora
Fuller was never mentioned In any of
their conversations.
A few days later he returned, this time,
wearing a Derby hat. I asked him hla
name and he said after some hesitation
that It was Bennett. I asked him if ha
had seen the people I had sent him to and
he answered that he had, but did not like
the terms they offered. We talked for
some time, but came to no arrangements.
I noticed him more particularly on this
occasion. He squared his shoulders in
military style and every once in a while
would give a convulsive twist to them-.
He was about five feet eight or nine
inches and well built. I should judge he
weighed about ISO pounds.
"Subsequently I learned that he had
not been near the place I sent him to,
and I thought his actions rather strange.
About four weeks ago. when I had given
up all hope of seeing him again, he went
to the store next door. About two hours
later I saw him standing on the opposita
side of the street, some distance dowr.

It was about the end of the month of

O a man closely resembling tha

him several times during the early part
of January to negotiate for the purchase
of furniture sufficient to fill a house the
size of which he did not know, nor was
he able or willing to give an idea of" its
prospective location. . |
"It was early fn January," said vance.
"when the man came to me and Inquired
about a sign on the outside of the store.
He said he was thinking of furnishing a
house. The first question I asked him
was whether he had secured a house or
not. He said he had not. but had several
locations In view. He looked at some fur
niture, mainly of the. cheapest kind in
stock, and we talked about the terms. He
said he did not have much ready cash.
and I referred him to an investment com
pany In which I ana interested and which
handles Installment business.
"When the man first came to my place
he wore a dark %uit, a long dark over
coat, which might be- either gray or
black, a dark Fedora hat with' a rather
broad brim, and glasses. I was surprised
that a man of hia apparently prosperous

Juror Schlueter â I Just fouud this paper tin

Detective Hamill â I searched every nookj&nd

I think it xnuet have been brought out here by
the policeman who was guarding the house
Gunday and yesterday; he evidently brought his
lunch with him. However. I will Investigate
the matter and see about it.
<The paper referred to bore the advertisement
of Gobey's oysters parlors. 22S Sutter street.)
Juror Boos â It looks like a fresh piece 01
paper; It does not look four weeks old.
Detective Hamill â All the newspaper report
ers went through the house with me at the
time, and I am sure that paper was not there.
*The Jury inepected the downstairs portion of
the house and also the basement.)
Thereupon the jurors went with the Coroner
to 2211 Sutter street.
Chief Deputy Coroner McCormack â The chair
â¢was right here {showing) and the bed was right
up here (showing); the shade hung on a string
er.d entirely covered the window.

The Coroner â Gentlemen of the jury, you do
solemnly swear that you and each of you will
Â¦well and truly try the matters involved In this
Inquest, so help you God.
After cwearingr the jury Â¦was escorted by the
Coroner to view the remains of the deceased.
The Jury vu then taken to the property
clerk's office of the Police Department to In
epect the clothing of the deceased and the bed
end bed clothes found at S211 Sutler street.
The Coroner â This undergarment was torn.
This Is a Ekirt and it was also torn. These

Juror Davit t: Q. â Were all these cords found

The Coroner â Yes, they were all stuffed in
the pipe. The cord and the card from Cavan

Juror Schlueter grew excited over the dis
covery of a piece of wrapping paper with
"Gobey's oyster house" printed -on it_ The
jurors crowded around and^critically ex
amined the paper. Detective HamiH po
litely suggested that the police had made
a thorough search of the house and would
not have overlooked the washstand where
the paper was found. He stated that a
policeman was placed there to guard the
house end mlgtit bare sent tor refresliâ
meats. This theory Is borne out by the
fact thaX the paper was clean and un
rumpled.

LIZZIE POTTER, who was stenog
rapher for Hugh Grant for eight
months, said last night that she
knew Nora Fuller and her mother
as client and daughter calling on

seeing a man by the name of Bennett at
the lawyer's office during the time she
Â¦was in his employ and certainly a card
bearing that name was never in her recol

that she bad never seen one and until

touching this important point was asked
Hiss Potter for the reason that m Nora
Fuller's purse was found a card or Rader
Â¦& Schneider.
Miss Potter emphatically denied know
ing either one of the firm, though she ad
mitted her father was acquainted with
Schneider in a business way. She had a
slight acquaintance with Miss Se&right
through her visits to Grant on profes
sional business.
"Nora Fuller came quite often, said
Hiss Potter, "but Mr. Grant seldom
talked to her in private; it was nearly
alvravs in my presence, too, that he spoke
to her. He addressed her as a fond
father would address a chGd. the con
versation being on ordinary social mat
ters. I cannot say how she "became pos
sessed of the Rader & Schneider card. Her
coming to the office I always attributed
to the legal business with which her
mother was concerned. Mr. Grant always
behaved in & most gentlemanly and cour
teous manner toward me and my reason
for leaving him was with the object of
bettering my position. I left his employ

LOS ANGELES, Feb. U.â Dramatic in
the extreme was the climax of the battle
between the Huntlngton-Hellman and the
Clark-Hook street railway interests to
day. Not In recent years has such, a con
test for supremacy between two rival
railroads been fought. While the mem
bers of the City Council listened unmoved
to the appeals of some of the foremost
attorneys of the city a crowd of specta
tors breathlessly heard the speeches that
brought to a close a contest that revealed
Senator Clark as a formidable rival of
the Huntington-Hellman syndicate for
supremacy in Los Angeles railway circles.
The fight arose over the granting of
franchises for street railways, for which
bids were opened yesterday. B. Murray,
the mysterious person who bid $415,000 for
the Sixth and Seventh Ward franchise,
and was given twenty-four hours in which
to deposit the money, failed to "malte

The circumstances of her disappearance

enough cotton in the house to stuff the
doll and the mother volunteered to go to

absent about half an hour and on her re
turn she was unable to find the girl.

of last year, and no trace of her has since
been discovered. The authorities were
notified on the day following her depar

been unrewarded. Her parents and the
other members of the family have become
wildly alarmed for her safety since the
awful details of the murder* of Eleanor
Fuller have been made public. Charles

as a carpenter by the Southern Pacific

They were considered of especial value
owing to the insertion of a clause per

the proposed. routes. When the bids were

Huntington-Hellman syndicate had bid
only 125,000 for the two franchises that

Judge Gear, the presiding Judge ~of the
term, ordered the Immediate trial of pris
oners formerly convicted by methods he
held some months ago to have been ille
gal, arid since Indicted for the same of
fenses by a Grand Jury. The Attorney
General Is prosecuting the men under the
new indictments and at the same time is
holding that the old convictions are valid.
This question wil come up in the United
States Supreme Court next April. '
Gear originally released the prisoners
because they had been tried without
Grand Jury - indictments and convicted
without unanimous jury verdicts after
the annexation. Attorney General Dole,
holding that United Statfes laws regard
ing such matters did not extend to Ha
waii by virtue of the resolution by which
the islands were annexed, nor. until the
Hawaiian Territorial act took effect, took
an appeal; though Gear, denied the prose
cution's right of appeal in such cases.
The Supreme Court of the Territory sus
tained the Attorney General, but "United
States District Judge Estee rendered a
decision on habeas corpus according with
thatof Gear.' -
Since Kstee's- decision Judge Gear has
held to his view as therein , indorsed in
spite of the Territorial ; Supreme Court's
decision the other way. He declines to
recognize the old trials as valid. _ The At
torney General's department presented
the cases over again to a Grand Jury and
had new indictments brought, and the
cases came .up for trial again -this term.
Attorney General Dole had appealed one
of tho cases, that of Osaki Mankichi,
charged with murder, to the United States
Supreme Court, and he asked that all the
cases bo postponed untir that one is de
cided. The attorneys -for the defendants
demanded immediate i trials under the in
dictments, and Gear refused the continu
ances "asked for by the prosecution. Dole
asked the TerltorlaT Supreme Court foV
an injunction to stop Gear from hearing
the first case, which had been begun, but
.the Supreme Justices refused to issue an
Injunction. . _ . .-; â¢

DR. KILMER & CO., Binghamton, N. Y.
Gentlemen: It gives -me great pleasure to add my testimonial to that of hun-
dreds of others regarding the wonderful curative properties of Swamp- Root. I
had a lame Â¦ back . three years ago before leaving North Dakota for the coast.
Soon after my arrival \ in the Puget Sound country it became very much worse.
I felt certain that the) coast climate had given me acute rheumatism and came
to the conclusion that (I could not live In this climate* Later I became convinced ',
that -what I really had was kidney tronble, and that the rheumatism was due to
my kidney trouble. The lameness in my back increased rapidly and I had other
symptoms which ' indicated that I would soon be prostrated unless I obtained
relief, quickly. Noticing your offer of a sample bottle of Swamp-Root, free, I
had a friend write for one and began taking it Immediately. Within three weeks
the lameness In my back began to disappear. During that fall and winter
I â¢ took .' three one-dollar bottles of Swamp-Root, with the result that I be-
came completely cured- I no longer have pains in my hack and can exercise
violently without feeling any bad effects. I have recommended Swamp-Root to
several of my acquaintances who were similarly affected and without exception
they have been greatly , benefited by its use.
.. - . ' . Yours very truly.
' Lame back is only one symptom of kidney trouble â one of many â Â«Â»nd la Na-
ture's timely warning to show you that the track of health is not clear.
If these danger signals are unheeded, more serious results are sure to follow;
Bright's Disease, which is the worst form of kidney trouble, may steal upon you.
The great'kidney remedy, Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, i3 used in the leading
hospitals, recommended by physicians In their private practice, and Is taken by
doctors themselves who have kidney ailments, because they recognize in it tha
, greatest and most successful remedy for kidney, liver and bladder troubles.
EDITORIAL NOTEâ Swamp-Root has been tested in so many ways and has
.proven so successfulin every case that a special arrangement has been made
by which all readers. of The Call who have not already tried it may have a sam-
ple bottle sent absolutely free by mail. Also a book telling all about Swamp-
Root and containing many of > the thousands upon thousands of testimonial let-

got for the time being the rigid rules of
society. Debutantes of this and former
seasons appeared in costume and had
their swains guessing who they were. At
midnight when masks were thrown aside
surprises were many. .
The list of guests is as follows: .
It has developed that the only hitch to
the negotiations earlier was Herrin him

with Barham by~ which he was to have a.
string upon the paper. He insisted upon
certain conditions. relative to the editorial
policy of the Post, which Barham refused
to agree to without first consulting with
his associates in the deal. The wires were
hot with telegrams for a time, the result
being that the prospective- owners de

Southern capitalists but in fact the

were in circulation thÂ»t a syndicate was

Southern Pacific for the newspaper plant,
and the Harrimans chafed under the

PRINCE CARNIVAL.
My fair and merry subjects, hear me sing,

Prince of the Carnival and Lord of all Misrule,
* HERALD..
I am tbe Herald who thus appears.
Give heed! Give heed! Give heed!
Else these proceedings can't proceed.
Leave noise and to sweet silence cling
For Just a minute, and give the King
A chance to nay his little say
And lack of wisdom to display
To your admiring ears.
Immediately behind were, the huhiblo
subjects of King Carnival. As the long
procession wended its. way through -tho
spacious hall the occupants of the boxes
showered confetti on the favored and were
deluged In turn. .
The King and Queen took their seats en
the throne and the herald was instructed
to blow a signal, the Deglnning of cere
monies. The following programme was
then carried out: â¢ - .
Following the band came the King and
Queen. Mr. and Mrs. G. Cadenasso. Then
came the herald, Algernon S: Aspla'nd.
After him came the jester, Alfred J: Mc-

court, Messrs. Burbank Somers. Clarence

SOCIETY GRACES
MARDI GRAS BALL
At 11 o'clock the guests sat down to a
sumptuous supper, served in the immense
dining hall of the mansion. Dancing was
continued until an early hour this morn

dance and when he concluded the â¢ King
exclaimed, "On with the dance: let
joy be unoonfined," whereupon an orches
tra' stationed in" the gallery struck up a
waltz and the floor was quickly filled with
moving couples. As; soon as the dance
was concluded an orchestra stationed in
the main gallery began a lively two-step.
Throughout the ball the orchestras alter
nated.. The music was under the super
vision of Sir Henry Heyman.' The pro
gramme carried out. by King Carnival end
his court was prepared by Captain Fletch
er, curator of the San Francisco Art Asso
ciation. Girard Barton wrote specinl
music. . " ;
Herrin reluctantly resigned himself to
the inevitable and it is said will be forced
to consent to the unconditional sale of tho
Post for $100,000 to Barham. The papers
are now being drawn up and will be' signed
within a few days. : â¢, -
The new management of the Post will
Inaugurate a complete ' change of policy.
It is designed to make the paper indepen
dent in politics. . No Intimation is given as
to the personnel of the incoming managers
of . the journal, although it â¢ is surmised
that Barham will. be a leading figure < in
the editorial and business departments.
When neen last night Barham declined to
eay just what position he would assume,
if any at all, in the reorganization of the
journal. He denied emphatically a rumor
that he was acting in the Interest of Dan
Burns in the purchase of the paper,* ami
said positively that Burns was. not even
aware that' negotiations. to that end were
in progress. .; - â¢ .'
Barham is a shrewd business man,. with
some knowledge ' of the newspaper busi
ness. He has thoroughly familiarized
himself with the local" conditions as per

MERRY THRONG IN THE MAZES
OF A WALTZ AT THE ANNUAL
MARDI GRAS FESTIVAL.
The boxes at each end of the gallery
were in carnival colors and were an at
tractive feature of tbe decorations.
The Prince's throne on the north side
of the gallery was richly decorated with
Oriental draperies.
The Seaxles gailery was decorated with
thousands of yujrds of garlands, crossing
a.nd recrossing under the skylight and
from which depended baskets of ferns,
vines and flowers, festooned with red rib
bons. The walls were covered with white
drapery and over this was festooned myr
tle and intermingled with the myrtle were
vari-colored electric lights. Where the
garlands were festooned to the wall bows
of red and yellow ribbons were affixed
completing the effect.
The maple room, which is situated be
tween the house gallery and the main gal
lery, was particularly dainty, the walls
being draped with a canary colored ma
terial, over which were spread ferns, in
termingled with poppies, and interspersed
among these were Incandescent lights,
which carried out the scheme of gold and
yellow. In the doorways hung magnificent
baskets of ferns. The display was largely
floral. Magnificent begonias on a cabinet
toned Into the general effect. At one end
of the room was a grove in which was a
statue of the Venus de Milo.
The interior of the Art Institute was
never more beautifully nor more elabo
rately decorated. Flowers and potted
plants were used with artistic effect. The
principal decorations in the house gal
lery, which was transformed for the oc
casion into the "court of the jesters,"
was a hanging illuminated chandelier,
composed of innumerable lanterns of car
nival yellow. An Immense lantern was
surrounded by several tiers of smaller
cues cf the same color lighted by Incan
descent lamps and festoons of lanterns
were strung to the four corners of the gal
leries. At each end were colored devices
with carnival masks in the center on
Japanese ' umbrellas. Redwoods and
bamboos, twenty or thirty teet high and
wreathes ot evergreens tied with parti
colored ribbons, added to the scene. There
was a notable absence of the draperies
which in past years tended to obscure the
architecture of this magnificent gallery.
On this occasion the decorations were
simple, but more beautiful than ever be
fcre.
Interior of tbe Art Institute is
Made Resplendent With

rifles this evening between the followers
of rival claimants to property lying along

The property ...in dispute consists of

drive and between it and Lake Michigan.
Captain George W. Streetor, who has for
many years been a thorn in the side of
rvorthside property owners because of his
propensity to settle on vacant ground
and then claim in the courts the rights
of a squatter, has erected several small

that. Inasmuch as it was not originally

Cabanlss yesterday afternoon. The com
plaining witness was A. Newman, man
ager of his wife's millinery store at 130
Sixth street, who alleged that he bought
from Jens for $500 one thousand shares of
a company having mines In Calaveras
County on the representation : that they
were very valuable. The Judge decided
that the alleged misrepresentations were
opinions rather than assertions of fact.
Streetor, accompanied by Policeman
O'Malley. went on the ground of the
"district" and was attacked by Streetor,
who knocked him down with the butt of
a revolver. Several of Streetor's follow
ers covered O'Malley with their weapons
and he was ordered to leave or be shot.
Shortly after Cooper and O'Malley had
left the ground a pitched- battle began
between three of Streetor's followers,
William McManners, William Blokie and
John Hoeldtke, and two watchmen em
ployed by Cooper, Frank Kirk and Sam
uel Porterous. Kirk and Porterous were
standing outside a small shanty of their
own, and one of the first shots fired
struck Kirk on the top of the head. Por
terous entered the shanty and returned
the fire of the Streetor men with a rifle.
A riot call was hastily sent to the East
Chicago-avenue police station and a
wagon filled with policemen was sent on
the run toward the place. When the
officers arrived Kirk's body lay In the
snow outside his shanty, while from the
window Porterous kept up a steady fire
upon the three men in the house, who
were returning his fire with all the speed
with which they could work their rifles.
The police arrested Streetor and all the
participants in the fight.

did the clubbing. Attorney George D.
Collins represents Moran, and Assistant
District Attorney Alford and Attorney
Peter F. Dunne the prosecution. The
courtroom was crowded, and as much in
terest appears to be taken in this trial
"as in the trial of Buckley. Moran's face
wore a strained, anxious look during the
proceedings.
The case cited is perhaps the' grossest of the kind,'
but it does not stand alone. -It appears there are con
tinual calls upon all the 'departments' of the ; Govern
ment for the compilation -and' publication of facts
which are ;of comparatively little value to the public,
and, which ought never' to -.be! called, for' in that;, way:
It t ;s right, of course, that Congress should , know
what is going on, â¢ but in ; seeking for information' it
should not forget to seek also for an understanding
i of what the desired knowledge will . co"st. T
The compilation, when published,' filled five large
.volumes, so that, in addition to the cost pi clerk" hire
the Government was .put to/further heavy- expense
for printing." It is quite safe to say' that neither the
Senator who, asked ;for the information nor any one
elseYwill ;ever- read 'those volumes.. The money' has
been done in vain and the. money Virtually wasted.
As an illustration -of the heaviness of the' work
often imposed;by.requests for information, it is relat^
ed that a Senator, recently introduced .a resolution
calling for a* report in minute detail of all receipts and
expenditures in ; - Cuba from the date of the military
occupation, to .'April 30, 1900, ?with. "a statement of
public. works of every kind, together with the cost,
necessity and propriety of the same, with copies of
contracts," etc. For the War Department to comply
with the request- the labor of ten clerks for six
months was necessary, and for six weeks those clerks
were obliged to work over time! Congress will there
fore have to consider a claim for their extra compen
sation. ; ' '-,,; .Â¦Â¦'.â¢â¢ : : c - -
Owing to public interest in all affairs of our insular
possessions and the prevailing ignorance concerning
them, the demand for information of one kind. or an
other concerning them has been so frequent as to im
posed heavy burden upon the Division of Insular
Affairs, and accordingly the officials have made a
protest. The public has thus been made" aware of tHe
extent to whichA'the abuse has been carried. â¢
Back of everything in this ; wbrld, however, there
is & question of cost. To furnish information : for
Congressmen requires, a considerable expenditure on
the part of the administration; and there are times
when the cost seems to be more than the information
is worth. It. takes only a few minutes of time for
either branch of Congress to ask the
but it takes a great deal of time for the clerks of the
bureau having the matter in charge to compile it, ar
range it and get it printed. '" J '
WHEN a member of Congress rises in his
seat and asks that some branch of the ad
ministration be requested to compile, print
and furnish Congress with information concerning
any part of the public business his motion receives a
prompt second and is nearly. always approved by a
majority of his fellow* members. In fact a request
for information is one of the hardest things in the
world to refuse. When a man. wishes to learn, some
thing in order that he may moreproperly. fulfill his
duties it appears nothing -more than just and right
that the information should.be given him.
COSTLY INFORMATION.
Neither McCabe nor his railroad is, to be punished
for the .offense thus' frankly admitted. The "law .has
been violated, but it cannot be enforced; the commis
sion has been mocked, :.but it cannot vindicate itself.
Such a condition of affairs is not pleasing to a peo
ple who like our own have been brought up to have
a high respect for law and to look upon it as a safe
guard not only of justice. but of liberty. It is full
time for Congress to, take action in this matter. If
the law be unjust it should be repealed; if the com
mission be unworthy of respect it shotild'be abol
ished; but so long as the; one remains on the statute
book and the other represents the Government of
the United States the railroads should I be compelled
"I am in charge of traffic matters, and do what I
feel is necessary, to protect the interests of the com
pany."
"Who is responsible for such serious violations, of'
the lawâ such reductions from your public tariffs?"
"Yes; that was the purpose, if they were destroyed
I do. not say they have been destroyed, but I think
they have been."] , Â¦
"Possibly because we thought you might ask to
have, them laid before you," admitted Mr. McCabe.
Â«r "You -mean to say, then, sir, that those records
were destroyed for the purpose of "removing evidence
of your illegal acts?" :'Â¦*'Â¦
"Why/not?" insisted the Commissioner.
At a recent hearing in Chicago several traffic man
agers were under examination by the commission
concerning the granting of rebate^. They had no
hesitation in admitting that rebates were granted
wherever it was deemed for the interest of the roads
to grant them. One of these officials, D. T. McCabe,
traffic manager of the Pennsylvania lines west of
Pittsburg, testified to giving secret reductions in
freight rates, and when asked for the records of the
office showing the transactions said they could not
be produced as the road did not have them. ' The
following conversation is then reported to have en
sued between McCabe and Commissioner Clements:
"No records of transactions- involving so much
money?" doubtfully asked the Commissioner.
"I do not think we kept them after they had served
their purpose."
If the. reports that come to us from the East be
accurate the commission had good grounds for mak
ing that complaint. It was not uttered upon a moral
conviction of the guilt of railway officials, but upon
a certain knowledge of it. In fact, so powerless is
the commission to enforce the law that it cannot en
force respect for itself, and railway men have no hesi
tation in frankly admitting violations of the law and
defying the commission to punish them. '
WHEN making their recent report to Con
gress the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion deplored: "That the leading traffic
officials of many of the principal railway lines, men
occupying high positions and charged with the most
important duties," should deliberately violate the stat
ute law of the land, and in some cases agree with
each other to do so; that it should be thought by
them necessary to destroy vouchers and so manipu
late bookkeeping las to obliterate evidence of the
transactions."
MOCKING THE COMMISSION.
It looks as if those Bulgarian brigands had made

The latest yawp of the Cuban reciprocity schemers
is that if we do not provide prosperity for the Cuban
sugar planters we will be worse than Weyler, because
he undertook to feed at least the people he shut up in
his concentration camps, while we purpose to let
everybody starve.- If this sort of thing keep up we
may expect the reciprocity fanatics to appeal to Wey
ler to come over and thrash us into consenting to
free trade.
.' This closed the case for the x defenss,
with the exception: of two, witnesses who
will be. called to-morrow to testify to the
general good reputation of the defendant.
.The , defendant took the stand in â¢ his
own behalf and his story was" the same
as that of his wife. When -asked if he
intended to shoot Griffin, he raised his
hand aloft | with the answer, 'As God is
my judge, I did not!" He , declared that
he /wanted merely to intimidate Griffln by
a display of armed , force and . that .. the
weapon was discharged by accident.'
.This practically closed the case for the
prosecution. The defense consisted of the
testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Glllespie.
Mrs. Gillespie swore that a loud noise as
of; breaking dishes in the Griffln room
attracted^ her attention 'and on opening
the door' she saw a fragment of dish
strike Mrs. Griffln in the breast. Griffln
called her a, vile' name and ordered her
to leave the room. She called her hus
band, and ; as she did so she saw Griffln
go to a closet and return with a knife <n
his hand.: Griffln said he would fix Gilles
pie if he interfered and on the latter's
arrival the witness told him to be care
ful, as Griffin was armed. "Gillespie
thereupon left the room' and returned a
moment later with a revolver.', Qriffln
became abusive j and finally, made a hip
pbeket motion; whereupon Glllespie fired.
>ThV witness was positive Griffin was not
seated 'hv the rocking chair at the time
of the shooting. '., v. ' - â¢-'.
"I was putting the potatoes on. the ta
ble, when my husband took up a mush
bowl and thrust it down very hard upon
a saucer, breaking it Into fragments. He
spoke rather loud, and just at that mo
ment Mrs. | Gillespie opened the door and
walked into the room. She wanted to
know what was the matter, and my hus
band'.told her to -get out- of the room.
She went to the " door and called for her
husband, who came and said that order
must be maintained. Gillespie then went
out of the room and returned with a pis
tol'In his hand. My husband was sitting
In the rocking chair with his arms rest
ing on the arms of the chair, when Gil
lespie put his pistol directly in my hus
band's face. My husband . laughed arid
said he guessed Gillespie wouldn't shoot
anybody, and at that moment the pistol
was discharges. I saw the flash in the
looking glass, for I was not looking at
either just at that moment. When I
turned I saw my husband leaning back
in the chair with blood all over his face.
I asked him If he was hurt, but he never
answered me. He was taken to the hos
pital and. when I saw him again he was
dead." . ?
After the opening statements by special
Prosecuting Attorney Black for the peo
ple and Attorney Robert Ferral for the
defense, Officer George "W. Russell pre
sented and explained a diagram of the
house at 119 Ninth street, where the trag
edy occurred. Mrs. Emily Griffin, widow
of the deceased, was then called to the
stand. She testified that her husBand
came' home in an, angry mood on the
evening of August 2, and when she in
quired the cause of hi3 perturbation he
told . her he -would explain after supper.
â¢Continuing, she testified:
Gillespie's trial promises -to be one of
the shortest on record. The testimony for
the prosecution and defense was all
heard yesterday, excepting that of two
witnesses who will testify to Gillespie's
good character to-morrow. The argu
ments will be brief and an Immediate
verdict is expected.
THE trial, of George'D.'f Glllespie, a
well known local .politician * and
lodging-house keeper ' r aÂ®U8 .Ninth
street, for the killing ;of William
F. Griffin, an apprentice^ plmnber,
on the evening of August 2O'iast,'.was be
gun In Judge Cook's court yesterday. ;
it is to be borne m mind, moreover, that many of
these fences erected in front' of vacant lots are raised
to. such a height and rented to advertisers at : such
prices as enable the owners to make a profit while
leaving the lot unused and vacant. Thus they tend to
check the upbuilding of"^the city and detract from
the value of the adjoining lo'tsi An injury is there
fore done not only tc the community at large but
to particular persons. Some remedy should be pro
vided by law for the mitigation -,of these .evils,' and if
nothing better can be devised we recommend .the
Supervisors to try taxation. 1'
There is no reason why they should not be taxed.
A fence is property and advertising is a trade. More
over bill board and fence advertising is like peddling,
inasmuch as it makes use of public thoroughfares,
â¢and therefore is rightty subject to municipal super
vision and control. Finally, such advertising is not
infrequently a gross nuisance, marring the appear
ance of the city, offending the eye and leading up to
the erection of huge* fences that are a serious danger
to passers on the streets and to "adjacent property by
reason of their liability to fire.
It is clear that where low fences or light railings
are erected along the top of an embankment more
than ten feet above the adjacent sidewalk no harm
h done. Such fences are not so unsightly as to de
face the city, neither are they, sufficiently heavy to
constitute a menace to persons on the street in time
of high winds, nor so inflammable as to be danger
ous when fires break cut. The unsightly and danger
ous fences are, in nearly every case, those which are
erected along business thoroughfares and used for
advertising. If then a tax be imposed upon such ad
vertising, or a license be required for the erection or
use of fences for advertising purposes, the fences
would then pass under the license laws of the city
and could be regulated'by taxation exactly as are
other licensed privileges. " - â <
While the decision seems technical, it rests upon
a fact which is beyond gainsaying. The configura
tion of the city is such that in 'many districts the
ground upon which houses are built and fences are
erected is more than ten feet above the adjacent side
walk. Hew to adapt tin ordinance to the irregularity
of the topography of the city will be found a perplex
ing problem, and perhaps it may have to be aban
doned. . %
Should that prove to be the case there remains
another method of dealing with the nuisance. The
Call has repeatedly directed attention to the good
results -obtained by the French Government in im
posing a system of taxation upon bill board adver
tising, and there is every reason to believe'that were
a similar system adopted in San Francisco a long
step would be taken toward eliminating the worst
evils of the high fence nuisance.
{In deciding the issue the Judge said: "In many
cases the surface of the ground upon which fences are
or may be erected in this city and county is more
than ten feet above the level of the adjacent sidewalk.
Upon such a lot no wooden fence whatever could be
erected without violating the ordinance. A fence one
inch high would be more than ten feet above the level
of the sidewalk. Inasmuch, therefore, as the ordi
nance denies to some property owners what is per
mitted to others it is not equal and uniform in its
operation and is, in my opinion, invalid."
JUDGE SEAWELL'S decision that the high
fence ordinance recently adopted by the Board
of Supervisors is invalid brings before that body
once more the problem of protecting the city against
the nuisance and the danger of high fences along
crowded thoroughfares. Since the present ordinance
is invalid a new one must b.e devised. The continu
ance of such fences is an indisputable evil and it is
incumbent upon the Supervisors to provide a remedy.
TRY TAXATION.
That lesson from Texas shouldnot be lost upon
California. It is to the. advantage, of all that, the pro
posed descriptive catalogue" be speedilyimd accurately
compiled, and cordial, assistance!? should be given
by all producers of every kind to the association in
completing, publishing and circulating -the work.
"Thirty-eight delegates from the New Ybrk.Mer
chants' Association and Chamber of Commerce, spe
cially appointed for the purpose, visited : Texas in
April last with the ultimate purpose of promoting the
investment of New York capital in industrial "devel
opment in Texas and of increasing' the trade of New
York with that State. Eleven sub-committees were
appointed, each charged with a special .' branch of
study. The party traveled- more than 6ooo miles and
visited thirty-seven important points in Texas. The
preliminary statement' of. the report of the, delega
tion, and one upon which' stress is laid, is that it was
assumed that ample dataas to the natural resources
of^ the State and their present development would be
readily accessible from official sources. Much to the
disappointment and embarrassment of the various
'committees, it was found that such data was exceed
ingly meager and did not furnish. a comprehensive
view of the natural resources and industrial condi
tions of the State. The report states, 'There is a no
table lack of such information as to .Texas, and in
all probability the State has been much prejudiced
thereby.'"
As an illustration of the need of compiling full in
formation concerning the State and its products the
prospectus says: â¢ . Â¦
While there have been a large number and variety
of publications on the subject of California products
there has been none that is thoroughly comprehen
sive in its nature. From each of them there has been
omitted something of importance to the* State and to
its commerce. The Â¦ consequence is that even well
informed Californians themselves" have but an inade
quate knowledge of. the industries carried" on
around them; and those who are most willing to pa
tronize home industry frequently make use of foreign
articles simply because they do not know of the ex
istence of home products of the same kind.
The object of the* catalogue, as stated by, the pros
pectus, is to make known the products of California
to' consumers both -at home and 1 abroad: It will be
given a free' general distribution throughout the
Union and jvill also be circulated in other countries.
It is not the intention to insert any paid advertise
ments and no charge .will; be made for a description j
of any Calif ornian' product.- On the "contrary, the,
prospectus announces that "full information regard
ing all products is solicited in order that all may. be
properly represented. It is desired to obtain the data
for each subject from those having special' knowledge
of it." : . / -
BY" " the Manufacturers' ,and jj Producers' Associa
tion there has been issued a prospectus of a
descriptive catalogue of the . commercial ! pro
'ducts, natural and manufactured, of the State, of Cali
fornia, -which is to be accompanied by -a general re
view of the resources, and advantages of the State,
so that as a \vholeit will constitute a valuable addi
tion to our commercial- literature and will prove an
efficient factor in expanding; and increasing our traded

Investigators in the" Capitol at ' Washington have"

Genghiz Khan laid his empire like. a vast blanket
upon the world, from the Caspian to the Yellow Sea.
His descendant, Tamerlane, dominated from 'the
Euphrates to -the YangtserKiang, and set up the
peacock throne of the Moguls at Delhi. But all these
feats of arms were as nothing to what this old woman
has done by a decree that has no sword behind it but
her resistless will and awakened spirit. She was born
a slave, but she has liberated one-third of/ the human
race.
She goes to the front of the class composed of such
women as Semiramis, Tomyris, Zenobia and Kath
arine. ' The people of the Western nations should
meet her halfway in this determination to maintain
the unity and promote the progress of her vast em
pire. It is neither by territorial division, nor by in
vasion for selfish exploitation, that China is to.be
come a useful and contributing member of the family
of nations, but by an awakening. She has all the lore
and wisdom of the past. What Babylon and Egypt
had, she has. The virtues and ideals of Oriental phi
losophy are hers. Her people have 'morality, fidelity,
thrift. They possess the domestic virtues, a keen mer
cantile instinct and patience at toil surpassing that
of the ox. At present they feel only the wants of the
remote past. Their needs are primitive. As they go
up the path opened to them by the Empress Dowager
new needs will appear, with new duties and new
ideals. At the same time their capacity to trans
mute their resources to supply the needs of the West
ern world will increase, mutual exchange will grow
and out of normal commercial intercourse they and
the West will prosper. â¢ \ .
The old Empress" has gone further. She has de
creed the emancipation of her sex. By a. decree she
has forbidden foot binding, and from- her genius a
flash of light has illuminated farthest Cathay."
She has received the foreign; legations in the.For
bidden City and the sacred palace. .She has admitted
the wives of the foreign Ministers, replied to an ad
dress by Mrs. Conger, wife of our Minister, made s
her presents and sat with the ladies at tea. She has
broken the exclusiveness of the .Manchus. Hereto
fore the Manchus never went abroad. Chinese'were'
forbidden to intermarry- with them. They were the
stern and narrow rulers of the empire." Ignorant of
the world, self-poised, self-sufficient. The Empress
Dowager has broken their power. They are com
manded toÂ«educate their sons abroad, to permit inter
marriage with .the Chinese, and are practically put on
a level with the rest of the empire in its government.
For years the Chinese proper have known the rest of
the world, its laws, its civic institutions and its people. Â¦;
They have furnished, to China its great and learned^
men, Li Hung (Chang, Marquis Tseng, . Wu Ting
Fang, Ho Yow and others. Their ideas of regenera
tion and progress have been restrained by the narrow
Manchus. / .
Chinese royal -exclusiyeness and- austerity have
been forever banished. The kowtow is no more.

powerful and remarkable woman in the world. Her

rate of new Insurance keep, up for the
year the New York Life will secure $300,
000,000 in new paid- for policies, a figure
so far in advance of anything hitherto
achieved that there is no opportunity
for comparison.
In his report made at the beginning of
the year, Air. McCall foreshadowed the
era of insurance activity now prevailing.
He insisted that the old style of man
agement which was disposed to quibble
over the settlement of claims, and which
denied the right of the insured to loans
and surrender values on demand, must
give wav to more liberal ideas, and also
that an open record of all transactions
of the year should be furnished annually
to the insured.
The announcement Is made to-day on.
the occasion of the celebration of the
tenth anniversary of the election of the
Hon. John A. McCall to the presidency
of the New York Life Insurance Com
pany. Insurance men and financiers ad
mit that this is one of the strongest In
dications of the general prosperity of the
country that has been presented since
the dawn of the new year. President
McCall Is being showered with telegrams
and letters of, congratulation from offi
cials and agents of the New York Life
all over the land.

Clouds of sand picked up by the gale
were - carried across the country with
fearful force, and at Wadsworth, Deseret,
Thistle, and other towns business was
practically suspended all afternoon, it be
ing almost impossible for one to breathe
while facing the drifting, whirling walls
of dust. At Deseret and Mirage the sand
rilled the air to such an extent that the
suti was obscured and lamps were neces
sary.
At Humboldt House, about forty miles
west of Winnemucca, the few persons
wno ventured out of doors beheld a pecu
liar sight. About eight miles south of
the town is a mountain rising abruptly
from the sandy desert The wind, sweep
ing across the flat country, caught the
scow of this hill and seemed to stretch it
out for two or three miles from the slopes.
Through occasional breaks in the clouds
of dust across the plain between the town
and the mountain the middle slopes could
be seen, apparently swept bare of snow in
a few hours by the terrific force of the
wind. The storm to-night shows but little
sign of abating.
FORT TOWNSEND, Feb. 11.â Captain
Kalstrom of the steamer Alice Gertrude,
arriving from Neah Bay this morning,
reports that the most furious storm of
the season prevailed down the straits and
off Cape Flattery last night. The wind
was from the southeast- and of hurricane
force. Towboats with vessels in tow were
untble to make headway and were com
pelied to seek shelter, while many sailing
vessels off Flattery, awaiting a chance to
get in, were driven far out to sea. No
casualties were reported, but shipping
men fear that â¢ some of the vessels will
meet mishap, as most of them are in
ballast. Â¦ .
RENO, Nev., Feb. 11.â Since early this
morning the wide stretch - of desert in
.Western and Central Nevada, has been
swept by a windstorm that at times ap
proached the proportions of a hurricane.
At several points on the Central Pacific,
between Reno and Elko, the - wind blew
at the rate of eighty miles an hour.-
Though no -serious damage to property
has been reported, It delayed trains,- pros
trated telegraph wires and long stretches
of railroad are buried in sand.
He thought the co-operation of the
liquidator of the old company with the
new should be accepted as a proper guar
anty from that company as to its posi
tion, and held the opinion that no appre
hension need be felt on that score. \ He
expressed the further opinion that any
trouble that might arise over the right of
Â¦way could be encountered in dealing* with
a Central American Government, but
said this trouble Is as probable In dealing
with Nicaragua and Costa Rica, for the
Nicaragua . route, as with Colombia in
dealing with the Panama' route.
In reply to questions Pascoe said he
understood that there are now two gen
tlemen In the South American republic
for the purpose of co-operating with the'
Minister from that country in granting
the necessary concessions for the con
struction of the Panama canal - by the
United States. â¢Â¦ â¢ Â¦ ' - . .
Pascoe was questioned at length by Sen
ator Morgan as to the effect of the varl
out treaties between the United States
and other powers relative to the canal and
also as to the bearing of the French laws
on the proposed transfer, the result be
ing that Pascoe and Morgan disagreed
on most of those points. Senator Morgan
also sought to bring out the fact that a
concession of only ninety-nine years in
the way of a lease, such as has been given
to the Panama Company by the Colom
bian Government, would'not be sufficient
to meet the demands of the United States
in case the proffer, of sale by the present
Panama Company should be accepted^by
this country, and Pascoe agreed with him
on that point, adding his opinion that a
concession in perpetuity could be secured
from Colombia. He assented to a sugges
tion made by Senator Foster of Louisiana
that investigation of title in - France
might be necessary in case the^purchase
should be decided upon, but added that
such an Inquiry would not be a serious
undertaking. â¢ ::
/ WASHINGTON, Feb. 1L â Former
United States Senator Samuel * Pascoe,
now a member of the Isthmian Canal
Commission, testified before the Senate
Committee on Interoceanlc Canals to-day
that he had carefully investigated, ihe
proposition made by the new Panama Ca
nal Company for the sale of the Panama
Canal rights, and that he was fully con
vinced that under the French laws and
the usages in the French court, that com
pany has a valid right to the canal, and
could therefore make a transfer to the
United States which would hold in law.

Tularo County Youth Receives

VISALIA, Feb. H.-Charles Howell. a
20-year-old youth living near this city,
had a terrible battle with a bull last night.
The animal attacked him unawares, strik
ing him in the back, knocking him down
and repeatedly; charging upon him. Finally
Howell grabbed the bull by the horns.
The enraged animal raised his head Into
the air with such force as to throw How
ell over the fence Into an adjoining field.
The boy was frightfully wounded and may

Rattler Bites Author James.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Feb. 1Lâ Professor
George "Wharton James, author and ' lec
turer Â«f New York City, was bitten on
the left thumb by a rattlesnake this af
ternoon. He was given medical attention
within four minutes and to-night is pro
nounced out of danger. The snake was a
big one in a cage and Jaxnes seized It by
the neck to lay it on the ground, so that
he could photograph it. The snake was
too strong for him and loosened Its head
enough to twist around and bite him.
The Bertha was built at Benicia by Mat
thew Turner in 1888. She was 185.5 feet
long, 32.5 of beam and 22.1 in length. She
had a registered tonnage of 926 tons.
During the first night on which the pas
sengers camped on the rock they suffered
no serious inconvenience, but on the sec
ond day a heavy rain set In, with a cold
wind that caused considerable suffering.
On Monday morning they were picked up
by. the Cottage City and brought to this
place. The loss of freight and baggago
by exposure to the elements Was a severe
blow to many of the passengers,' as they
had their last dollar invested in outfits for
the season's prospecting in Alaska,
On the approach of daylight the work of
lightering the vessel was commenced by
landing the horses and other freight. A
kedge was got out and the Bertha was
hauled into water again with the aid of a
donkey engine. As soon as she struck
deep water she began to sink, so she was
swung on to the beach, having lost her
keel, and having a large hole in her bot
tom, forward of the engine room. It is be
lieved that she will be a total loss.
All of the passengers were in bed. The
shock caused great confusion and a stam
pede was made for. the upper deck. Cap
tain Johansen and his officers quickly re
stored order, and on investigation it was
found that the vessel was In such
proximity to the shore that a" gangplank
would reach an elevated rock. The plank
was put into place and the passengers
walked ashore. Later bedding and bag
gage were landed and a camp was made
on the barren rocks.
The Bertha sailed from Seattle for Val
des. She encountered good weather until
Saturday when a storm set in and
on Sunday morning at 12:30 o'clock the
vessel struck on Harold Island.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. 1Lâ
Another steamship has been added to the
long list of wrecks along,- the Alaskan
shore. The Cottage City, arriving to
night, brought news, of the wrecking of
the Alaska Commercial Company's steam
ship Bertha on Harold, Island, near the
entrance of Fitzhugh Sound, north of
Queen Charlotte Sound.

This, said the speaker, was shown by
the letter, sent through a firm of lawyers
in London and through Mr. Galletly of
the Bank of Montreal to the company,
in which the writer said he had seen the
treasure.
VICTORIA, B. C, Feb.'lLâ At a meet-
Ing of the shareholders of the Pacific Ex
ploration and Development Company,
Â¦which has sent the treasure hunting ex
pedition to Cocos Island, Chairman H. H.
Jones to-day told of an offer that had
been made by Rear Admiral Palllser, for
merly In command on this station, to send
a man to guide the expedition to the hid
ing place of the pirates* loot In return for
a quarter of the buried millions for him
self and a twentieth for the man sent as
guide.
Rear Admiral Palliser had been with
one of the warships that went to Cocos
Island to search for the treasure. Accord-
Ing to his letter the sailors dug until thty
came to the planks and slabs which cov
ered the hidden gold. Then a half-ton of
dynamite was taken ashore and the whole
face of the rock blown out, Â¦ hundreds of
tons of rock being thus hurled down to
cover the hiding place of the treasure.
"This was done," explained Chairman
Jones, "because warships are not sup
posed to go on such a mission, and there
would have* been trouble had the Govern
ment known that they had, done so. More
over, as a British warship had turned
pirate and buried the treasure there, if a
warship had taken that treasure from the
island it is easy to Imagine what might
have happened. The sailors had it no
doubt in mind to rebury the treasure
when they found it and as soon as their
time expired with the British Government
they would go out and obtain the loot."

Local traffic on the broad-gauge line
was blocked for four hours, from 5 till
S o'clock to-night, by a wreck near the
Thirteenth-avenue station. The wrecked
train consisted of thirty empty flatcars
returning: from the mole, wnere a load
of dirt had just been dumped. Ten of tne
cars left the track and piled up on the
main line, whence It was necessary to
remove them before passenger trains
could be cot through.
The accident occurred as the engineer
of the freight train put on brakes as he
nearcd the switch. The .impetus of the
rear cars caused those nearest the engine
to "buckle," piling one on top of another
till a third of the train was ditched. The
engine did .not leave the rails.

scrimmage in' Justice Quinn's court this
morning, in the course of which the
women were accused of theft and the
man of railroading his I wife into the in

The immediate occasion of the quarrel
was a search warrant, sworn out by Mor

wife and mother-in-law had taken from
his room at 663 Twenty-fourth street.
According to Mrs. Green the box con

daughter in a madhouse. She does not
deny abstracting it from, his room, but
claims that she and her 'daughter had a
right there and were justified in takinr

A verdict was returned this evening; by
a Coroner's jury that Sieben came to his
death from a gunshot wound inflicted by
himself with suicidal intent.
Sieben had resided in this city for near
ly thirty years. He retired from active
business life some years ago.
Oscar S. Meysel, E. R. Randlett and
William. Hammond St., all particular
friends of the dead man, believe that he
had become insane through worrying over
the ghastly evidence in the Brandes trial
and 'was in that state when he fired the
fatal shot into his brain.
been quite 111 for six months, but his mnntal
trouble, 1 think, dates back to the time ot the
Brandes trial. We have frequently noticed
that he acted strangely, but never had any
reason to believe that he contemplated doing
away with himself. He waited until after I
had left the house this morning and about
8:30 o'clock went into the parlor, stood before
the mirror, so that his aim would be true, and
fired a bullet from an old-fashioned pistol
through his head. My wife, who was In a
rear room, rushed Into the parlor, but Mr.
Sieben was beyond all aid.
Judge Ogden finally declared that, the
citation for . contempt upon Daniels was
discharged and the Â¦ litigants left the
courtroom.: The deposition of Daniels
was to have been continued this after
noon.' but- as the j contempt proceedings
occupied the entire day it was continued
until to-morrow. Attorney Snook said
that i he did not know whether he would
permit his client to submit to further in
terrogations from Ach , or not. and - to
morrow will determine this new Issue.
' "In the Levinsky case," said Judge Ogden,
"the refusal of the witness to obey the- sub
pena of a notary public was contempt but
it was not contempt of the court, but. contempt
of the notary. This case is almost identical
with the Levinsky case. | If I had known of
this case this morning when I Issued the cita
tion I would not have issued it. The con
tempt-is confined altogether to the officer who
makes the order, and if there ia any contempt
he is the officer to punish the offense.
"This court has absolutely no. jurisdiction in
this case. If the' affidavit had been made of
castlron it would not have made any differ
ence. This couft has no authority to interfere
in this case." , , *>'
In an attempt -to convince the court
of his position Ach went into a long re
cital of the case and endeavored to show
that all the steps were regular, but Judge
Ogden had discovered the decision in the
Jjevlnsky case and no amount of argu
ment could shake his position. The at
torneys were all familiar with the deci
sion, so the court did not read it aloud,
but confined himself to the statement
that the present case, is parallel with that
of the Levinsky. , . - .
Court Dismisses the Proceedings.
When Mr. Sieben was at the breakfast table
this morning he seemed to be In his usual
frame of mind. He had cause to worry some
what over the condition of his wife, who has
plied Snook, "but you made a bluff and we
called it.".
Sieben was in easy financial circum
stances and his family life was happy.
Adam May, a stepson of the deceased,
said that Mr. Sieben had never made any
threat or intimated to any one* that
he Intended to commit suicide. MayÂ«Â£ur
ther stated:
Whenever any one would hearken to
him, Sieben would invariably revert to
the Brandes trial and in an excited an-1
vivid manner recount with detail the fea
tures In the case that had filled him with
horror and Impressed themselves Indelibly
upon his memory.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 'll.â To Incessant
dwelling upon the grewaome ex
hibit of- skulls and bones and
blood. -curdling evidence intro
?j duced in the Lillian Brandes mur
der case. In which he sorved as a Juror,
the relatives and friends of Philip Sieben
directly attribute his tragical suicide this
morning. " The culmination of his brood
ing over what he had been compelled to
witness > in this case came when he stood
before a - mirror in his home at 1709 Wal
nut street at 8:30 this- morning and fired
a bullet' into, his .head, causing instant
death. . â¢.-â¢.Â¦ Â¦.,-..Â¦ .
A1J the suicide's acquaintances assert
that since he participated in the trial of
William Brandes for the killing of his
little daughter Sieben has been a changed
man. To many of them he had often re
lated how uncanny visions of skeletons
without skulls and skulls without skele
tons would haunt him in his sleeping and
waking hours. Try as he would, he could
not, he said, dismiss the bony specters
from his mind. -
Twice Â¦. during the progress of the
Brandes case Sieben suffered strokes -of
nervous prostration and it was found
necessary to delay the trial until he had
recovered strength enough to sit in the
jury box and hear the testimony. As a
Juror Sieben was attentive and conscien
tious and persistently put questions to
the witnesses. After the trial had been
concluded he was forced to take a trip
Into the country for the purpose of bene
fiting his shattered system. The outing
did not improve bis health to any notice
able extent and - bis family and friends
became apprehensive of numerous men
tal vagaries and Irresponsible acts.
Ach insisted that the ' transcript made
the showing he was arguing for, but' the
court would not allow him to proceed
with the reading of â¢ the transcript. : He
then reiterated that he did not desire to
punish Daniels 1 for "contempt, but merely
wanted the books.
â¢Â¦Â¦â¢ Vlf the books are all that are wanted," said
Snook, "you can go to the Enquirer office at
any time and examine them." â¢.
'.'Then,- Mr. Snook," asked the court, "why
do you advise your client not to bring the
books into court?" -
To this question Attorney Snook replied
that | the books were â¢ open to the stock
holders of the publishing company at any
time. ' . '.-. t . .-v -J '-/':;Â¦Â¦' .Â¦;}--: Â¦Â¦ Â¦ \ - ' :â¢'
"It is shown here," continued "Ach, Â¦ Vth'at
Daniels is the president and general manager
of the company, and that he has taken forcible
possession of the books and ordered the book
keeper not : to " allow them to go out of his
possession." ' - Â¦ :Â¦ â¢ , . â¢. Â¦ Â¦ .
"Well, admitting that that is so," 'said
Snook, '"you have not "shown -in your affidavit
that Daniels is. in contempt." â¢ -. - ,
' "Well. I'll admit that the < affidavit is de
fective.in some respects. It ;wasn't intended
to cover all the ground that you want us to
cover." . Â¦ â¢ / - . .â¢â¢.,.. ... - .. .. . Â¦. Â¦ , .;.
â¢â¢."Of 'course, you- knew it was defective," re-
. At this point Ach submitted in evidence
the transcript of testimony offered before
tho ! Court' Coxnmlssoner, .and proceeded to
read it. ;
j "Iobject to reading any portion of the testi
mony not included in the affidavit," interposed
Snook. "The transcript does not Ehow .that
the bqpks were in the custody. of Daniels."
Objects to Reading the Testimony.
. "The affidavit surely: don't say where the
books are," said the court. "We must certainly
have things explicit before we send a man! to
Jail." . : â¢"
"The custody of the books, according to the
affidavit," said Snook, "shbws that they were
only in the possession of the defendant on
February 11 and at no previous time. There is
nothing. to show where they are. If my client
is to be sent to Jail by the mere recital Â¦ in
that affidavit that he has them I think. we
would all be going to Jail soon."
"Well, it would, not delight ur to see Daniels
In Jail, but If he haa those, books we want
them, if possible,'.' replied Ach. â¢ ., ,
To settle the question of the reason for
the non-productton of the books Attorney
Snook called Daniels to the witness-chair
to ask him some questions. But he- was
not allowed to answer, as the court sus
tained an objection. Snook pointed out
the fact that the affidavit on which the
citation was based did not state the exact
time the contempt. took place. \
"We don't know whether he . did or not.
We are trying to find out that from the books.
That's why we. 'want them produced. If these
men -who voted, this salary were bona flde
stockholders this diversion of funds against the
protest of any other stockholder was clearly
a fraudulent act.','
"Let us not argue the caÂ£>e now at any
rate," said Snook. "I hope your Honor will
not prejudge the case before we have a chance
to be heard."
"All I want," said Ach, "Is the books of
this 'concern and the/answers of this defend
ant.- We are not. here to have anybody im
prisoned for â contempt. We simply want to
gfct.a ruling on this; important matter. The
oijly Issues are the two I have stated. We
want to settle the question right now whether
our questions will be answered or not."..
"Well. I won't agree that the issues In
volved here are other than those that reicte
to the books as set forth in your affidavit,"
ealfl Snook. ', â¢'
"Your Honor," said Ach, "I was willing that
no punishment should follow the disposition
of this case, but if counsel will not concede
anything to us we'll proceed in the strict legal
way and endeavor to have Daniels punished."
Â¦"You're very Â¦ dramatic, Mr. Ach," retorted
Snook, "but that doesn't scare us nt all. We'll
proceed in the strict legal way, If you please."
Vital 1 Issues Are Involved.
"The complaint alleges that the directors
voted on December 13. 3898. to pay Daniels a
salary of $5oo a month from the time . they
got control of the paper February 5, 18lÂ»S,"
said Ach. ''It is Illegal in this State for any
director Â¦ to ' vote himself back salary or any
salary.
-^"It is not alleged that he drew the salary,"
said the court. ;- * â¢'. .
"We will show that they are," said Ach.
"I .- disagree with you," replied Attorney
Ach. * "I think on the showing we have mad<>
that we are entitled to an accounting and an
injunction.-" :'-'.
"'All the, stockholders are directed to ac
count?"-queried'the court.
"Pardee - and Dalton are not stockholders,"
interposed Attorney Snook. ,
"It Is our contention that they are," 'said
Ach. "We claim they nre the real owners."
"But they are not stockholders," replied
Snook. : ' ' â¢ 'â¢
When the. matter was called In the aft
ernoon Judge Ogden spent a half-hour In
acquainting himself with the complaint
before allowing Attorney Ach to proceed
with the presentation of his case. Ach
then read the section of the code under
which the taking of the deposition is au
thorized. "
"M. de Li Hadley !s the secretary of the
Enquirer Publishing Company," continued
Ach, "and has been called upon to produce
certain books which should be In 'his posses
sion. Â¦ He . has â¢ not produced these because
Daniels has forbidden that any books be taken
from the office. Daniels has the bocks in his
possession and he refuses to give them up.
We - want to show that Daniels, Pardee and
Daltcn are the sole owners of the Enquirer
and that they have been diverting Its funds."
"In what respect," asked the court, -'is all
this material? This is an action by a minority
stockholder for an accounting, as I understand
it." . â¢- . .
"It Is not material, but it is merely stating
the facts that lead up to the cause of - this
action." â¢ . -.
Attorney Snook, representing the de
fendant, took exception to this jino of ar
gument and :fcaid, it^had*-not been, shown
that the plaintiff was'entitled to "any: re

OAKLAND, Feb. 11.â G. B. Daniels of
the Enquirer < Pubiishing Company, who,
with Dr. George C." Pardee," Henry C. Dal
ton and others, is' being sued by D. Ed
ward Collins > for an accounting, . was
purged of contempt . of . court to-day , for
refusing>to answer the questions put to
him by Attorney Henry Ach before Court
Commissioner^ George C. Babcock. The
whole preceding depended upon the ques
tion of Jurisdiction. Judge Ogden decided
that' his court does' not have jurisdiction
in cases of depositions. "If there was any
contempt," he said, "it is the Court Com
missioner who is offended, and it devolves
upon him to punish the offenderâ if he
can." -; *'
-The fate of Daniels wa3 decided by the
ruling of the Supreme Court in' tha case of
Levinsky, a defendant in Contra Costa
County, who was haled before the Supe
rior Court for refusing to answer the
questions of a notary public. There the
court held that the Superior Court had
no juri8Giction to punish, and that the de
fendant was in contempt only to tne no
tary, who naa no power to punish disobe
dience of his rulings. Judge Ogden held
that the Levinsky case and tne Daniels
case, was Identical, with the exception
that in one case the referee was a notary
and in the other a Court Commissioner. -
This ' decision means that Uaniela and
the others" do mqi have to answer any
more question in deposition taxing unless
they wish, - ' â¢
The' day began with the issuance of a
citation by Judge Ogden commanding
Daniels to show cause why he refused to
answer certain questions and why he re
fused to produce the books ani documents
of the Enquirer Publishing Company be
fore the Court Commissioner, 'me cita
tion, which was made returnable at 1:30
o'clock this afternoon, was based on the
affidavit or Attorney J. B. Richardson for
the plaintiff. Court Commissioner Bab
cock also swore to a certification setting
forth that Daniels had refused to comply
with his rulings.

MRS. PETERMAN
ADJUDGED SANE
Court Settles Fight Over
Guardianship of Big
Estate.
Erstwhile Incompetent Now
to Resume Control of
Salt Lands.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Feb. 11.
The legal entanglements over the guard
ianship of the person and property of
Mrs. Mary Peterman, whose estate in
cludes large tracts of salt-producing
marsh land near Mount Eden, were un
raveled to-day by Judge Ellsworth re
storing, the aged woman to competency.
The proceedings leading to this result
were Instituted by Henry I* Peterman,
who also had his mother declared incom
petent a year ago and himself appointed
as her guardian. A petition was before
the court in the hearing just concluded In
which the other sons and the daughters
of Mrs. Peterman re<juested the removal
of Henry as guardian and the appoint
ment of some one else in # hls stead. Oa
the witness stand to-day these protest
ants withdrew the statements made in
the petition and joined in the request to
have their mother restored to compe
tency.
Commenting on the contradictory na
ture of the evidence before him. Judge
Ellsworth said that he thought Mrs. Pe
terman a good deal more competent than
several other witnesses in the case and
that with proper outside advice she ought
to be able to attend to her business.
The property involved was originally
worth about $50,000 to the estate, but is
now heavily lncumbered. The marsh
lands were at one time leased, to the
Federal Salt Company, but it has been
prevented from deriving revenue from
them by suits begun by Henry Peterman
as his mother's guardian, charging that
the lease was obtained by undue influ
ence. These actions are still pending.
Henry Peterman claims that negotia
tions are now pending which will clear
the estate and leave hi3 mother a good
income, amounting to about $1500 a year.
The original lease from the Federal Salt
Company was for $500 a year, and it wa3
this that caused the incompetency pro
ceedings about a year ago.
LANDERS STEVENS INFLICTS
SERIOUS WOUND ON" HIMSELF
OAKLAND, Feb. 1Lâ Landers Stevens,
the manager of the Dewey Theater, is
confined to his bed with a very serious
wound in his right leg, accidentally in
flicted by himself after the performance
of the 'Blue and the Gray" last evening.
Mr. Stevens was trying to drag from its
sheath a blade of a sword cane. "When
the blade, was finally drawn it stuck into
his right leg, and the actor-manager is
now in bed, trying to ward off a case of
biood-polsoning. The blade wa3 rusty,
and it is feared that it may have infected
the wound.
"The worst of it all is that it was done
after the performance, and even my own
company thought that I was fooling,"
said -Mr. Stevens. "I have a sword com
bat in the play, but there was no such
luck as to have it happen during that
fight."
Mr. Stevens wfll be compelled to remain
in bed for some time, and it has been
found necessary to change the bill for
next week and put on "Romeo and
Juliet", because of this accident.

THE SAN FJR#NG^^ '19Q2?
This preparation la called Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets and It Is claimed that one of these tab-
lets or lozengea will digest from SOO to S00O
times its own weight of meat, eggs and other
wholesome food. And this claim has been
proven by actual experiments In the following
manner: A - hard boiled egg cut Into small
pieces was placed In a bottla containing warm
water heated to ninety-eight degrees (or blood
heat), one of these Tablets was then placed in
the bottle and the proper temperature main-
tained for three hours and a half, at the end of
'which time the egg waa as completely digested
as it would have been In a healthy stomach.
This experiment was undertaken to demonstrate
that what it would do in tha bottle It would
also do In the stomach, hence its unquestionable^ 4
value In the cure of dyspepsia and weak diges-
tion. Very few people are free from some form
of indigestion, but scarcely two will have the
same symptoms. Some will suffer most from
distress after eating, bloating from gas In the
stomach and bowels, others have acid dyspepsia
or heartburn, others palpitation or headaches,
sleeplessness, pains in chest and under shoulder
blades, extreme nervousness as In nervous dys-
pepsia, but they all have same cause, failure to
properly digest what Is eaten. The stomach
must have rest and assistance, and Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets give it both, by digesting the
food for it and in a short time it is restored to
Its normal action and vigor. At same time the
Tablets are so harmless that a child can take
them with benefit. This new preparation has
already made many astonishing cures, as for
Instance, the following:
After using only .one package of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets I have received such great and
unexpected benefit that I wish to express my
sincere gratitude. In fact It has been sis
months since I took the package and I have not
had one particle of distress or difficulty since.
And all this In the face of the fact that the
best doctors I consulted told me my case was
Chronic Dyspepsia and absolutely. Incurable, as
I had suffered twenty-live years. I distributed
half a dozen packages among my friends here
who are very anxious to try this remedy.

Of new discoveries there is no end. but one of
the most recent, most remarkable and one
which will prove Invaluable to thousands of
people, is a discoverey which it is believed will
take the place of all other remedies for the
cure of those common and obstinate diseases,
dyspepsia and stomach troubles. This discov-

FOB PACIFIC UNION CLUB
.All the officials of thÂ« Southern 1 Pacific
Company who also hold positions with
the Market-street- Railway Company have
been notified by President E.'H. Hatri
man that they must sever their connec
tions with the latter^ corporation. As a
result they have all handed in their resig
nations â¢ to the Market-street road with
the exception of R. P. Schwerin, the man
ager of the purchasing department for
both roads. President Harriman, allowed
him to hold both positions as a matter
of policy. . Â¦ Y â¢;-. ,
The executive committee of the board of
directors of the Market-street Railway
will meet to-morrow, and it is definitely
known that the first business brought up
will be the acceptance of the resignations.
Those who are affected by the new order
of President Harriman are W. F. Herrin,
chief counsel; Dr. M. Gardner, who
holds the position of chief
surgeon; David R. Sessions, claims
attorney; Captain N. T. Smith, treasurer,
and Major J. M. Hanford, paymaster.
These officials have all sent in their resig
nations, deciding that when it , comes to
real business the Southern Pacific, with
Harriman at the, wheel, is the best of the
two corporations to stay with.
Scb.werin.'s Aid Desired.
The diplomatic hand of Harriman is
shown by his graciously consenting to al
low R. P. Schwerin to still act as pur
chasing agent for both roads. His reason
for allowing Schwerin to remain is solely
for business motives. President Harri
man, after due consideration of the mat
ter, decided that should. Schwerin resign
from the Market-street Railway his suc
cessor would possibly not be as friendly
with the Southern Pacific. The street-car
corporation receives : annually vast
amounts of supplies from the East over
tho Harriman roads, and the big railroad
magnate, with a clear . eye for freight
business, decided that with Schwerin still
purchasing agent there would be no fear
of any of this freight business going
over the Santa Fe lines.:
Benefits Expected to j Result.
A prominent railroad man said that
the resignation of the officials connected
with both corporations is simply the out
come of the new ownership of the South
ern Pacific. He explained that in the old
Huntlngton days' the two companies wer<j
owned by the same Interests, but to-day
the stock Is held by entirely different cap
italists, who have nothing in common. . .
"I think it is a very wise move on the
part of President Harriman," he said.' "it
is a bad policy for two companies- that
are so extensive as the Southerir Pacific
and the Market-street Railway to transact
their business together under the same
roof and attended to by the same officials.
These resignations are no surprise to me
and I think the change will be of great
benefit to both corporations. >

The agreement is signed by Lord Lans

Minister to Great Britain. These Minis
ters so well kept the secret that the paper
Issued after Parliament had adjourned
for the night, announcing the first impor
tant alliance between a Western and an
Asian race, comes as a startling surprise
to the public, and although the idea of an
alliance with Japan is likely to meet with
general approval, the outcome of this sen
sational departure will be anticipated with
no little anxiety. It is regarded as a di
rect move against Russia and to explain
the abandonment of the colony of Wei Hai

The discovery that their Eastern poli
cies were identical resulted in each party
to the agreement expressing its desire that
their common policy find expression in an
international contract of binding validity
Lord Lansdowne further says that the
British Government was largely Influenced
in entering upon this important contract
by the conviction that it contains no pro
vision which can be regarded as aggres
sive or self-seeking. He says it is con
ceded merely as a measure of precaution
and that it in no way threatens the pres- 1

SANTA CRUZ. Feb. 1Lâ Louis . Casselli
came to Santa Cruz last September from
Hanford, where he had been in the hotel
business. He decided to purchase a hotel
in Watsonville, and on September 19 came
from that place after inspecting the ho
tel, hitched his horse in front of Gari
baldi Villa and engaged a room. A half
hour later he disappeared and has never
been seen since. He left a waistcoat
containing a watch, a chain and a ring
in the room. Although relatives and offi
cers have made a thoroug-h search not
the least trace of him can be fourid.
Casselll is 36 years old. His relatives
have offered a reward for information
that may reveal his whereabouts.
Choen Koen, his assailant, was charged
at the City Prison with murder. He said
that he had been following Ching Ging
for two vears. He alleges that the dead
man stole his* wife. He said that yester
day was the first opportunity he had to
get revenge.
Hardly had the patrol wagon taken
away the first man when Sergeant Conboy
saw a highbinder fire two shots into an
other Chinese. The victim dropped in his
tracks and Sergeant Conboy gave chase
to his murderer. The murderer, ran into
a lodging-house at S44 Washington street
and Conboy fired several shots into the
floor, hoping to frighten him. The fugi
tive paid no heed to the shots, however,
and endeavored to escape by way of an.
exit on the Stockton street side, but the
Chlng Gins was the first victim. He
â¢was standing at the corner of Washington
street and Church alley shortly after i
o'clock when Choen Koen stepped up be
hind him, pulled a revolver from under
his blouse and fired two shots into his
body. Police Officer Tillmann was near
by and quickljv had the assassin under
arrest. Ching- Ging, who was- mortally
wounded, was hurried to the Central
Emergency Hospital, where he died about
fifteen minutes after his arrival. One
bullet entered his back, near the spinal
column, passing- completely through his
body. Tfce other bullet passed through
his right arm and was found by Dr.
James Murphy in the silk blouse.

"Many of my friends have quit coffee
and are using Postum and I do not know
of a single one who has not been bene-
fited. Some of these did not like Postum
at first, but in every case I found the
cause to have been not having boiled it
long enough. The directions are" easy
enough to follow, and when followed a
delicious beverage is the result, but some
slovenly cooks put It on to boil for five or
ten minutes, but that does not make 'good
Postum. After the real bubbling or boil-
ing has begun it should be allowed to
boll at least fifteen minutes." Name given
by Postura Co., Battle Creek, Mich.
"I have now been drinking Postum for
over a year and my health has steadily
Improved; the nervousness and dyspepsia
have entirely disappeared. I have gained
twenty-five pounds in weight and feel/ at
least, ten years younger than I did a year
ago. ..., ...â
"A friend insisted that I quit coffee and
try Postum, and, although I did not be-
lieve it was the cause of my ill health, I
consented to try the new coffee. I
bought a package and wife prepared it
strictly according to directions and I was
wonderfully pleased to find It so delicious
and refreshing; the quitting of coffee was
a pleasure rather than a task.
A man In West Plains, Mo., writes: "As
the coffee habit grew on me my health
declined in the same ratio. I was subject
to nervousness, constipation, dyspepsia
and a general weak feeling which made
me unfit for business, and finally I be-
came so nervous and thoroughly broken
down that I could not; attend to business
and turned everything^over to my assist-
ant and went to the mountains In Colo-
rado, hoping to find health in a change of
climate, but after six months' sojourn I
came back in worse condition than I left.
But once In a while a person wakes up
and throws off coffee entirely, then the
truth begins to appear, and it is an easy
job to make this change if Postum Pood
Coffee is taken in place of coffee.
They will charge the coated tongue and
j bilious condition to something they have
eaten, likewise the wretched condition of
the bowels and the palpitation of the
heart. The sallow complexion is generally
attributed to a "naturally Wlious" tem-
perament.
It is curious to watch a coffee toper and
observe how he or she will resist all sug-
gestions as to coffee being the cause of
their various ailments.

gers and the usual big cargo of
island freight. Her time from port to
port was five days twenty hours, and
this through seme of the dirtiest weather
that has prevailed on the Pa'cific for a
long time. The Alameda got into port
just ir. time, for an hour after she en
tered the harbor the bar began to break
to the extent of effectually locking the
Golden Gate for the night. It was pretty
rough when the pilot boarded the steam
ship, but just the same a record for pilot
catching was established which will be
hard to beat. When the dinsey contain
ing Pilot Kortz was sighted the Ala
meda's course Teas directed toward the
little craft. At 3:21 p. m. Captain Herri -
inan gave the signal to stop. At 3:22 p.
m. the signal "full speed ahead" was
given. In the interval the dingey had
come alongside, Kortz had grabbed the
Jacob's ladder, climbed up the side and
v.-as aboard the steamship. This would
be a short stop with the water like a
millpond. When yesterday's record was
made there was a big sea en, the liner
was pitching heavily and the dingey was
tossing up and down like a feather In a
March gale. Two stowaways on board
the Alameda caused the quarantine au
thorities to detain the vessel for about
an hour. The plague in Honolulu is said
to have disappeared altogether, but the
authorities still insist upon the steerage
passengers undergoing an inspection.
This formality the stowaways for obvious
reasons tailed to observe.
The Alameda brought up cabin passen

"I wish to declare most emphatically
that I never said any such thing, either
at Payson or at any other place. I have
expressed my sentiments as to the families
of men who contracted plural marriages
years ago; that they should provide for
and educate- and take care of them . in
every proper way. I say so now, but the
remarks attributed Â¦ to me about 'Uncle
Sam' I never made, and the statement
that I did so Is utterly and wickedly
false."
President Smith, when seen to-dav,
made the following statement in regard to
this section of the report:
Among the specified statements by
church leaders on the questions dwelt on
in the report is the following: , Â¦
Â¦ "Joseph F. Smith, formerly chief coun
sellor to President Snow and now presi
dent of the church, said in 1896, while
dedicating a meeting house in Payson:
'Take care of your polygamous wives. We
don't care for Uncle Sam now.' "
Third â That the Mormon authorities continue
to publicly teach and insist upon the rightful
ness of polygamy Is abundantly proven by
public utterances of high. officials.
First â Polygamous cohabitation aÂ« evidenced
by the birth of children or the acknowledgment
of parties concerned or concurrent testimony of
neighbors, and sometimes by all of these,. Is
proven to continue in multiplied Instances in
Salt' Lake City, Logan, Brig ham City, Provo,
Payson, Smithfleld, American Fork, Prlce t
Sandy, Tooele and elsewhere In Utah, and also
In Paiisiyand Montpeller, In Idaho.
Second â That plural marriages have been
contracted since the church manifesto was Is
sued Is shown by the returns giving the names
of parties In several of the above mentioned
places, some of- the new plural wives not hav
ing come to a marriageable age, as early as
181K). the date of that document.
The returns coming from parties whose re
liability can in every case be. vouched for by
members of this body show the following con
ditions prevailing at the present time:
This report is to be used as a petition
for the passage of a constitutional amend
ment prohibiting polygamy, and will be
sent to the Judiciary committees of Con
gress. The report, which is quite lengthy,
sets forth that positive evidence can be
produced that polygamy Is both practiced
and taught by the Mormons at the pres
ent time in open defiance of the laws of
the State.' The document contains numer
ous quoted statements "alleged to have
been made by Mormon leaders in which
the practice and teaching of polygamy are
advocated and urged, regardlefs of man
made laws to the contrary.
The document is the' outgrowth of nu
merous meetings of the alliance, resulting
several months ago in the appointment
of a. committee to investigate thoroughly
the reports of the continued practice of
polygamy, such evidence to be used in the
campaign for a constitutional amendment
against polygamy. The ministers
that the evidence is in such. shape that it
could be produced Â¦ as evidence in court
if it became necessary to do so. Besides
being sent to the Judiciary committees of
Congress, the document, it is said, is to
be extensively circulated in the East to
further the. campaign for the anti-polyg
amy amendment to the constitution.
The report, after quoting a number of
Mormon. leaders In favor of the practice
of. polygamy, dwells at some length. upon
the colonization schemes of the church,
which, according to the committee's re
port, have a twofold purpose, viz.: To
enable the Mormons to practice polygamy
"where they will be free from the,scru
tiny of- their Gentile neighbors," and to
secure the balance of political power in
the ; sparsely settled States of the "West,
thus blocking the way of any proposed
hostile national legislation. /The report
sums up as follows:
SALT. LAKE CITY, Utah. Feb. 11.â The
Ministerial Alliance of Salt Lake has
unanimously -adopted } the report of the
committee of that organization appointed
to investigate and report upon the alleged
practice and teaching of polygamy by the
Mormons at tho present time.
Congress Will Be Asked to Pass a
Constitutional 'Â¦'â¢ Amendment to
N Prohibit the Alleged Prac
tice in Utah.

"Winnie O'Connor took the closing race
with Nllgar, a 7 to 5 choice. Passing
Young Morello and Quiz II in the stretch,
O'Connor got the favorite home nearly
two lengths before the last named starter.
It was, probably fortunate for the back
ers of old Wolhurst, winner of the mile
and a. furlong run, that a stronger rider
did not have the mount on Joe Ripley,
the 2 to 1 favorite. Brodlen. a light
weight, did well until it came to a stage
in the stretch where strong urging was
necessary. Then he . lacked strength and

. Bullman started' in by capturing the

He beat the others away from the gate
and, : hustling the gelding throughout, won
by two lengths from Screenwall Lake. Al

str&ch with O'Connor, finishing fifth.
A five-f urlons dash for maiden three
year-olds resulted in a victory for Lass
of Langdon. The filly closed an even
money . favorite and, leading from the
start, beat out Bud "Wade two lengths.
Conley landed Breton in third place.
Adirondack, the game little two-year
old from the Burns &.\Vaterhouse stable,
and a 9 to 10 choice, had a close call from
defeat in the four-rurlong spin. Bullraan,
who had the leg up, slipped 'away from
his field as the barrier flew up, stealing a
march of three lengths. O'Connor on Dot

stretch, and the two crack riders indulged
in a furious drive to the wire. Both
youngsters stood the gaff well, Adiron

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
NEW YORK. Feb. ll.â To-day's stock mar
ket showed a further expansion in the deal
ings and the great irregularity of the market
continued. The selling side was rather better
represented than yesterday, but many promi
nent stocks took up the advance at new
points. The disposition to take profits was
very natural on the eve of a holiday There
was obviously some misgiving also among
speculative buyers lest the expectations of
coming deals would not be realized. This was
especially the case among local tractions,
where the glamour of the coming announce
ment of the. Metropolitan Street Railway deal
has suffered some decline. The anxiety on the
subject was keener as an announcement is
thought possible over the holiday. Recent
sanguine expectations of benefits to accrue
to the express companies from some sort of
consolidation suffered from eclipse as shown
by the sharp drop of 7% In United' States Ex
press, although the stock finally rallied 4%
American Express, after rising nearly five
points, lost it again. There were however
significant points of strength in the market!
The Steel stocks were all very heavily bought
on encouraging trade prospects, but the
United States Steel stocks met enormous of
ferings at every slight advance. The late
movement in Pennsylvania was regarded as
an alternating movement with that in South
ern Pacific and due to operations by the same
interest. Texas and Pacific was advanced on
the strength of the Increase In the yearly dis
bursement on the company's second incomes.
The cause of the strength In the Iowa Cen
tral stocks and the Minneapolis and St. Louis
stocks was the supposed competition for con
trol between the Illinois Central and Rock
Island. There was very large buying of
Southern Railway and Louisville and Nash
ville and of a number of stocks of compara
tively email capitalization, which was not ex
plained. The buying of the Readings con
tinued very large, but they showed the effect
of profit taking. . The industrials as a rule
outside of the Steel stocks and some of the
Gas stocks, were Inclined to heaviness. Amal
gamated Copper showed a good recovery, but
closed with a small net loss. The closing was
active end irregular.
Business | in bonds continued very large and
the price movement irregular. Total sales,
par value. $4,640,000.
United States new 4s advanced % per cent
on the last call.

under light and diminished .receipts, and all
markets seemed to be working Â¦ stronger. There
was some Eastern buying on the large decrease
stated by Bra/istreet's above. ' The Missouri
State report gave the condition of the crop at
80, but also gave an increase In acreage of 34

Oats practically, made up all the recent loss
on purely local conditions. Trade was light.
May closed firm, %@%c up, at 43c. ,
In spite of big hog receipts provisions were
strong. Opening prices were lower, but a good
commission-house demand for pork brought a
sharp reaction. May pork closed 2%c higher,
lard a shade up and ribs a shade higher.
The leading futures ranged as follows :
CHICAGO, Feb. 11. â The trade in wheat was
still much in the same rut as for the past week.
Information was divided rather evenly between
the opposing forces and It was largely the even
ing up over to-morrow that brought out the
scanty strength that held to the cereal. North
western receipts were light, but advices had it
that there was plenty of . wheat there that
would soon > come out. Reports from Oklahoma
and Kansas were unfavorable for the winter
crop and were regarded merely as the forerun
ners of a long series of complaints about crop
disasters which will accompany the opening of
spring. Some strength developed early, in corn
and oats, and when Bradstreet's reported a de
crease in the world's available supply of 3,423,
000 bushels compared with a large increase a
year ago wheat was helped upward. Trade on
the whole was email, but that also probably
was due to to-morrow's holiday. Liverpool
cables were steady to start with, but eased off.
May opened a shade to ' %c up at 77%@77%c,
sold up to 78c and eased back to the opening
prices. May closed firm at its top figure, %@
%c higher, at 78%c.
Corn was lower at the opening on lower ca
bles and some forced selling. Covering and the
better tone in wheat . and Â¦ oats later caused a
rally. The close was firm, May%c up at 61%
Â®ei%c. . â¢ Â¦- - Â¦
Butter Urm, Cheese steady and Eggs in much, heavier receipt.
Provisions neglected. Hams selling down to cost and even below.
Dried Fruits quiet and firm in all positions.
Hops firm and in fair^demand.
Wool well cleaned up and firm. Hides rule easy.
Not much change in the Meat market. i â¢" :
Potatoes and Onions coming in frost-bitten. , *
Poultry in moderate receipt and firm.
Six cars of Oranges to be auctioned to-day.
Lard Oil declined. j
Zocal bonds selling well, but stocks dull.

Beans and Seeds still very dull. ' -
SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Receipts of Butter were more liberal, and
while the market was momentarily firm the
firmness Is not expected to last in view of the
warm, moist weather, which is very favorable
to a large increase in the production. ' There
are some sales of fancy creamery at 29c, but
they form a small proportion of the aggregate.
The receipts of Eggs, as will be seen below,
were heavy, and nothing but the light spot
stocks prevented a break In prices. There were
more ' on the market, however, - and if the ar
rivals continue large- for a day or so a decline
will" probably result. Some dealers are report
ing sales of extra fine ranch at 22c,'~but this
figure Is rather extreme for a positive quota
tion.
Cheese continues steady and without notice
able change. . . ' - . '
Receipts were 38,600 pounds. 13 tubs and
kegs of Butter, pounds of Eastern Butter^
1327 cased of. Eggs, cases of Eastern Eggs.

The voting an amendments to the oleo
margarine bill in the House to-day indi
cated a considerable, change of sentiment
?! Rce tne last Congress, when the bill had
106 majority, and that the opposition to
the measure has gained strength. White
the passage of the bill is not endangered
it is not likely that the majority to-mor
row, when the final vote is taken, will
exceed thirty. The opposition to-day was
strong enough in committee of the whole
to adopt two amendmentsâ one that noth
ing In the act should be construed to pre
vent the manufacture and sale of oleo
margarine in any State for consumption
entirely within such State, and the other
to provide for the Inspection and brandln"
or renovated or process butter. The lai
ter amendment was especially obnoxious
!2 "If., '"ends Gf the measure, and when
the bill was reported to the House a sepa
rate vote was demanded on it. The vote
Wa . w^ endl^ s when the House adjourned.
Although the amendment commanded a
majority of twenty in committee of thÂ»
whole, where no record Is made, it Is not
"nljkely that the action of tho commute*
will be reversed to-morrow, when mem
Â£Â«Â«Â«?u? oblleed -*Â° so on record. Several
committee- amendments adopted to-day

Teller of Colorado had concluded for the
day his argument against the enactment
of the pending Philippine tariff bill. In
response to some statements he mac!e
Platt directed the Senate's attention to
the situation in the islands, maintaining
that great progress was being made by
the -Government in subduing the insurret
tion. Hoar ridiculed the statement^ of
Platt, and in a facetious vein advened to
the efforts of the American Government
to control the Filipino people.
The remarks of the Massachusetts Sen
ator aroused Piatt. who made a notable
speech, In the course of which he referred
to Hoar in sharp terms. In reply Hoar
aelivered a criticism of the action of tne
Philippine Commission.
Â¦WASHINGTON. Feb. 11.â A stirring de
bate .onV the general Philippine question
was precipitated in the Senate to-day, the
principal participants being Platt of Con
necticut and Hoar of Massachusetts.
Friends of other aspirants for the posi
tion at once preferred charges against
Daniels, declaring ; that he was a faro
dealer and all . around bad. man. It is
these charges, apparently, that have led
the President to recall the Marshal's
commission he had tendered the Ari
zonan. . , \
Daniels took $250 and went on to "Washi
ington to see the President. A week
later Conn received a dispatch from Dan
iels saying, "I've got the appointment,"
and the papers the next day announced
that Ben Daniels had been appointed
United States Marshal for Arizona.
"Help yourself, Ben,'; he said. "Take
enough to go to Washington and see
Teddy." ;
"I believe 1 can get something from the
President."- he said to Conn, "but I
haven't enough money to go and see
him.".
Conn went to his 'safe and brought out
his gold box.
Daniels was mining in the Magdalena
district in Sonora for some time, and a
few years ago sold a mine for $4000. He
had many friends and his money wa3
given freely, as is the custom on the bor
der, until he was left : without a cent.
Forced by adversity, he went to his old
friend, M. M. Conn, who conducts a
gambling house in Nogales, and told him
he was "broke." ' , .
Goes to See the President.
Daniels was a cowpuncher for some
time in Arizona.- He has been a pros
pector and miner, a meralur of many a
Sheriff's posse in pusuit of outlaws; but
in all his life on the border he has never
had a quarrel, bar one incident in Crow
Canyon, which cost him a portion of his
right ear. Daniels was engaged on a
round-up, of cattle and one night in camp
a cowpuncher attacked him. Daniels
tried to throw the fellow off, but in the
scuttle his assailant bit off a piece of his
ear.
He is â¢ regarded as strictly honest, al
though his life has been cast among the
bad men of . the frontier country, i No
doubt the President knew the character
of Daniels, and if he has recalled Danieis'
commission as Marshal it is because he
could not make the people see Daniels
as he is. .
On the border Daniols 'is regarded as a
man ' oi exceptional nerve and daring.
Av hen he nrst came to Arizona he
"trained" with George Hayes, the noted
cowboy and border "gunngnter." Daniels
and Hayes are still good friends. Dan
iels' character is littingiy described . by
one of his iriends, who says: â¢
"Daniels will shoot a man if he has to,
but he won't steal/'
Noted for His Baring.
It is eaid Daniels saved the life of Col
onel itooseveii on one occasion. A ripan
ish sharpshooter was airecting his iviau
ser buiiets at the leader of the Rough
Kiders. Daniels had oeen sent forward
as a scout by Roosevelt arm found tne
sharpshooter in a tree, trying to get ac
curate range with his rifle to Kill tne col
onel. Daniels picked the" shurpsnooter
out of the tree before he. could harm the
commander.'
The story of Daniels is a border ro
mance, Ha sequel being the recognition
by President Koosavelt of tne iormer
cowpunciier, wno lougnt valiantly on San
juaitn.il, lonoweu oiuy yesteruuy uy tne
seeming witnurawal oC ine rewara ten
uereu ihe irontieismun, uy tne nation's
cmei.
TUCSON, Ariz.. 'Feb. 11.â Friends of
Benjamin Daniels still believe that lip
will be United States Marshal for Ari
zona, notwithstanding that yesterday's
dispatches from Phoenix announced that
his . commission had been returned to
Washington at the request of the Presi
dent. They, declare that Roosevelt is a
man of too much "backbone" to "turn
down", the former Rough Rider because
of attacks made by_ Daniels' enemies, and
that should the President not restore the
commission to Daniels it will have been
the first time on record in which he baa
permitted himself to be . influenced oy
political wire-pulling. â¢ v '

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
HOLDS MONTHLY MEETING
W. H. Mills made a striking assertion
concerning the inactivity of San Francis
co in exploiting the resources of the ter
ritory lying north of Tehachapi. and
therefore tributary to this city. He said
that the advertising that Los Angeles had
secured for the southern portion of the
State was an asset the value of which he
estimated Â¦ at $10,000,000. In twelve years
the State Board of Trade had expended
$250,000 in advertising the State. â¢ In fact
it had been the only agency to advertise
this part of California. In the same pe
riod the great city of San Francisco
Â¦which had an assessment roll of the total
amount of $500,000,000. had not expended
more than $10,000 to advertise the interior
F. McKenzle, representing Commission
er Sedgwlck, invited the board to send a
California exhibit to the Crystal Palace
exhibition in- London, but the request was
denied because there were not funds
available.
Director Wooster and others debated
the best means of having the advantages
of the State brought to the notice of the
people of the Bast. On motion of Woos
ter, thanks were voted to Tne Call, the
Chronicle and the Sacramento Record-
Union for recently .calling attention to
the resources of the central and northern
portions of the State.
In addition. to this the State Board of
Trade, at the meeting yesterday after
noon, received a preliminary report con
cerning the exhibition to be made at St.
LouLs. The committee met yesterday
forenoon and continued in session some
hours. The fact appeared that the coun
ties which are asked to furnish funds to
secure an adequate representation of the
State at St. Louis desire to have county
exhibits, that localities may be definitely
identified with the products that are
shown. The committee was given more
time to make inquiries concerning a large
number of details.
Interior of State Poorly Advertised.
The effect of this move will be to pro
vide a permanent exposition of the re
sources of the State in the most public
place in San Francisco where it must
daily be seen by thousands. Another ad
vantage will be in having an exhibit of
comprehensive scope always under the
control of the State Board of Trade that
can be moved, if necessary, to any place
-where great crowds congregate, as in the
case of a national convention in the Me
chanics' Pavilion, or other rallying point.
'J hjs will not do away with the county
exhibits that are now on the upper floor
of the ferry building, where they occupy
a much greater space than is ever allot
ted to any one State at a world's exposi
tion.
Steps were taken yesterday that will
probably result In placing a large, com
plete and representative exhibit of the
products of the State of California In the
grand nave of the ferry building, at the
foot of Market street, where they may
be seen by every person who enters into
or passes out of San Francisco by the
Market-street gateway. The State Board
of Harbor Commissioners have signified
their willingness to allot the necessary
space in the grand nave. Yesterday af
ternoon the State Board of Trade, on mo
tion of W. H. Mills, instructed Secretary
Filcber to proceed to collect the exhibit
for the board. Mills, In making the mo
tion, said that the State exhibit should
be complete and that even* industry In
the State should be represented. The
t>oard readily and unanimously adopted
the idea.
Permanent Exposition of Resources.
I. W. Hellman Jr., who is one of the
stockholders in the association, was seen
last evening. He Baid that the question
of erecting a magnificent hotel building
had been discussed, but that nothing defi
nite had yet been decided upon. He said
that the corporation will tear the present
building's down at once and that the char
acter of the building to be erected in
their place wquld be announced in the
near future.
Several meetings of the association
have been held recently and I much dis
cussion ensued in reference to the pro
ject. It is said that a number of the
stockholders were in favor of erecting a
hotel on this site, owing to the splendid
location. .
The members of the Bankers' Invest
ment company, which is composed of lo
cal capitalists who purchased the largest
portion of the Blythe block last June, are
at present considering the advisability of

WATER INQUIRY
Schussler Tells of New
Sources Acquired by ,
The investigation into the operations of
the Spring Valley Water Works, prepara
tory to fixing the rates to be charged for
water, was resumed last night by thÂ«
Beard of Supervisors. The company sub
mitted maps ; of all the properties owned
by the company in the various countle3.
They, showed that the company has fifty
seven pieces of property in actual use. 1
Chief Engineer Schussler demonstrated
by means of a large map the several res
ervoirs and water sources owned by the
company. Schussler went into considera
ble detail 'regarding' the new Alairteda
Creek system in the Livermore Valley
recently acquired by the company.
Schussler said the system at present sup
plied lO.OOO.UOO gallons of water dally to
dan' Francisco.
Schuasler told of another corporation
called the Suburban Water Company, or
ganized in Alameda County to deal with
iarmers and others who Insisted on be
ing furnished with water in return for
rights of way. He said the Suburban
Company was controlled by the Spring
Valley Company. Mayor Schmitz desireU
to know* the exact relations between the
two corporations and Schussler explained
that the" Spring Valley Company organ
ized the Suburban i Company to supply
consumers in other counties, as the
Spring Valley Company could only sup
piy the city of San .Francisco with water.
Brandenstein objected to the company
listing as one of its properties the Ala
meda system, from which water was sup
plied to other counties. Brandenstein held
that the entire system should not be recK
oned as an asset of the company upon
which an income should be allowed.
Braunhart objected to a clause con
tained in Schusaler's statement that the
last | Board of Supervisors had held a
secret meeting on February 23, 1901, when
the water rates were fixed. Schussler de
clared that he had not been heard at the
meeting and that he had intended to give
testimony as to under-valuations and
omissions in the report. Brandenstein
held that the evidence was all in at the
time and called on Schuasler to retract
his charge that a secret meeting had teen
held. Schussler agreed to strike out the
word "secret," but the board held that
there had been no meeting:â only a con
ference. Schussler finally withdrew the
charge altogether. M â.',_, .
The board accepted Schussler's invita
tion to visit the Livermore Valley system
next Sunday and adjourned to meet next
Tuesday night to continue the inquiry.
Policemen ,<m Their Muscle.
The police officers of this city will be
on their muscle next Monday night at the
Hall of Justice, when the Civil Service
Commission will conduct a physical ex
eniinatlon of those who desire to take the
examination for promotion, to positions of
corporal in the department. . , The exam
ination will be conducted by Drs. Bazet,
Buckley and Ward, the last two being
members of the Board of Health. About
two hundred policemen have filed.appli
cations to take the examination for pro
motions. The oral and written examina
tions will be held In the auditorium of the
Girls' High School February 23 at 1 p. m.

The California Camera'Club held- ;Its

The certificates were issued January '25,
and in due course Greany received re
ceipts from Catherine Kavanagh and
John Kinsella of Baltimore and Sister
Mary Baptista of Los Angeles. . Three
heirs, named, respectively, Bernard and
Lizzie McArdle and Mary Riley, who live
in this- city, also filed, receipts -of their!
certificates. Another Baltimore heir, Ann
Kinsella, did not receive her Â¦ certificate,
and on making inquiries at the bank At-
It is at this point that the criminality
of Gross in the transaction begins. After
making the order of payment on, the back
of the certificates of deposit the papers
were handed to * Gross with instructions
to mail them to the heirs.
Several months ago Gross became inter
ested In the probate of the estate of the
late Bridget Kenny, in which Assistant
District Attorney John T. Greany was
counsel for the heirs. . The proceedings
were concluded some days since and an
order of distribution waa made by the
court. Â¦ By this order an estate consisting
exclusively of cash amounting to $4291
was to be divided among seven heirs, each
to receive $613. Greany gave the. money
to Gross, with instructions, to deposit it
in the Crocker- Woolworth National Bank
in his (Greany's) name and to secure sev
en certificates of deposit in the sum of $613
each. This was done, and on receipt of
the . certificates - Gross gave them to
Greany, who thereupon wrote on the
back of each an order to pay the amount
specified in the certificate to the heir
named therein as payee. --..'.Â¦Â¦
Gross Secures the Certificates.
Gross is well known in this* city, hav
ing practiced with more or less success
in the local courts. He resided until six
months ago with his wife and three chil
dren in Oakland, when he removed to
San Francisco. He was a prominent fig
ure at some of the clubs, but a diligent
search of his haunts by Captain Sey
mour's detectives thus far has failed to
reveal any clew as to his whereabouts. â¢
The Information that Groes was wanted
by the police leaked out late last night,
notwithstanding every effort was made
to keep the circumstances of his.' flight
secret. Only essential details of the trans
action In -which Gross figures as principal
could be learned. Sufficient is known,
however, to render it certain that if ap
prehended he will . be vigorously prose
