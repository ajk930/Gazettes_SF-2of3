CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N, W.. WASHINGTON. Jan. SO.
âThe repeal of all the war reve
nue taxes, except the tax on
mixed flour, was unanimously
voted by the Ways and Means
Committee of the House to-day and a.
resolution was adopted authorizing Chair
man Payne to frame the bill. The Re
publicans of the committee by taking the
initial action anticipated the move that
Â¦was contemplated by the Democrats, 'and
the politics in the action is found in the
following statement by Payne:
"It will be seen that we have kept far
ahead of our promises in repealing these
â¢war taxes. We promised when the bill
Â¦was passed that the taxes should be re
pealed as soon as the war and the ex
penses growing out of the war should
cease. While a portion of the expense
Is eolng on, yet because of the wonderful
prosperity of the country and the great
Increase In revenue from other sources
we are able to wipe out the entire war
taxes."
Before the final vote on the main prop
osition was taken In the committee ths
Democrats proposed and voted for
amendments excepting from the repeal
the products of the Standard Oil and su
gar trusts, repealing" the customs duties
on trust-made goods and , providing for a
tax 6T one-tenth of 1 per cent on -the
gross receipts of all corporations whose
annual receipts exceed $10,000,000.
These propositions were all defeated by
a strict party vote.
WHIN REPEAL TAKES EFFECT.
The resolution passed provides that the
repeal of the internal war taxes shall
take effect July 1, 1302, and the repeal of
the war duty on tea of 10 cents a pound
on January 1, 1903.
The tctal repeal of the war taxes will
reduce the revenues to the extent of $77.
000,000. This will 'still leave a surplus,
estimated upon this year's receipts, and
expense, of over $22,000,000 for the year,
while the Treasurer will start upon the
next fiscal year with 5174,000,000 available
ce*h in the treasury. The committee
deems it wise to have the repeal of. the
tax on tea take effect on the 1st of Janu
ary next. In order to enable retailers and
email dealers who have small slocks of
duty paid goods on hand to dispose of
them before the repeal takes effect. The
only exception in the sweep of the wax
taxes proposed is the tax on mixed flour.
This last year only amounted to -$6606,
but the committee decided "to keep the
tax on. The bill 'will pass both -branches'
of Congress with little or no opposition.
Newlands of Nevada and Metcalf of
California took actrve parts during the
committee's deliberations.
STATEMENT OF PAYNE. .;
Chairman Payne made the 'following
statement on the proposed repeal:
"The treasury now, has an available
cash balance of something over $174,000,000.'
It is not likely that this will be Increased
materially during the present fiscal year,
as the treasury is buying bonds at a rate
that will use up the surplus to accumulate
between this and the end of the fiscal
year, June 30 next. The" Secretary of the
Treasury's report estimated a surplus for
this year of $100,000,000, and subsequent re
sults seem to confirm this estimate. ' The
committee, therefore, thought it- was en
tirely safe to repeal the.remairider of the
war revenue taxes, amounting to $68,000,
000, and" the tax on tea; amounting to $9,
000,000, in the aggregate^ $77,000,000, at this
time. This will still leave a surplus esti
mated upon this year's receipts and ex
penses of | $22,000,000 or $23,000,000 for the
year, while we will start upon the next
fiscal year with $174,000,000 available cash
balance in the treasury. The committee
deems it wise to have the repeal of the
tax on tea take effect on the 1st of Janu
ary next, in order to enable those, espe
cially retailers and small dealers, who
have stocks of the duty-paid goods on
hand to dispose of them before the. repeal
takes effect. We can provide a rebate oil
the tobacco tax and guard against any
fraud upon the revenue for the reason
that the internal. revenue department has
this trade under close surveillance, and
can and will take an account of the stock
In, the dealers' hands, on the 1st day of
July next. But this will be impossible as
to teas, which come in as customs duties
and of which the Government has no ac
count, save as they are imported in large
quantities by the Importers. Continuing
this tea tax to the 1st of January will
give us six months' revenue In the next
fiscal year upon tea, and will make the
ultimate reduction for the next year con
siderably less than $75,006,000. "The bill .will"
be presented, to the House as soon as it
can be prepared."
Appended is a list of some of the leading-
articles affected by the repeal of the war
tax and showing the amount of revenue
they, have produced under, the increased
rate: . â¢ .
"The tax on beer is placed at $1 per bar
rel, a reduction of 60 cents; beer has pro
duced over $112,000,000 of war revenues.
The tax on tobacco Is placed at 6 cents
per pound,. a reduction of 3 6-10 cents; to
bacco-has produced over $54,000,000 of war
revenues. ' ' ;
The repeal of schedule A of the law in
cludes the tax on bonds, debentures, etc.,
certificates of stock, sales or agreements,
stock transactions, inland bills of ex
change, bills of lading, indemnifying
bonds, certificates of profit, brokers' con
tracts, custom-house entries, warehouse
entries and steamboat passage tickets;
these articles have produced about $120,
000.000 of war' revenues.
The repeal under schedule B includes a
tax of 1 cent per pint bottle on. wine and
2 cents on bottles over a pint, and legacy
taxes; these articles have produced over
$15,000,000 of war revenues. :
The special- taxes wiped out by the re
peal are those on. bankers and brokers,
dealers in grain, securities, etc., pawn
brokers, ; custom-ho'use brokers, proprie
tors of theaters, circuses, \ exhlbtions.
bowling alleys . and billiard-rooms, and
dealers in and manufacturers of tobacco
and cigars; these have produced about
$20,000,000 of war revenues.

usually found In the average city thieves.
"Wegg" men have an intense hatred for
policemen and when one of them mur

he becomes a' hero In the eyes
of his comrades in. crime. Members
of this class of thieves always have two

bands. The cripples go about from place

at the same time to, take Courtney into
custody if he succeeded in locatirig^hini.
â¢ Courtney has but one eye, and as he is

LONDON, Jan. 30.â Dispatches received
here from Dublin contain alarming re
ports of a reign- of terror prevailing in
Roscommon County. Tenants . who are
suspected of paying rent are visited at
night by armed men, notices are posted
threatening death to traitors, and mid
night meetings are of nightly occurrence,
the people being assembled by beacon
fires. John O'Donnell, member of Parlia
ment for South Mayo, is reported to have
addressed a midnight meeting, at Fair
mount, at which he challenged the Chief
Secretary for Ireland, Wyndham, to come
into the open at the head of 5000 or 10,000,
either soldiers or police. If he (Wynd
ham) would give the men of Connaught a
month to prepare, O'Donnelf said, he did
not hesitate to declare that he would
meet them, even at great numerical odds,
and settle the land question for good.

The suspect is of about 110 pounds
weight, with his "right eye out, and ap
parently partly paralyzed on the right
side. He wore no beard and is rather
light complexioned. Geizicke took the
man out and at onee commenced to in
terrogate him. He â¢ had evidently been
drinking. He- stated that he had left
Napa the first' of the week and gone to
Vallejo. From there he started up this
Â¦way, but was "switched out" ail one
night at a station and came near -freezing
to death. . . â¢
"'I'll have to take you to Stockton," said
the Constable.
"Don't take me to the asylum," said
Courtney, in apparent alarm.
He was then asked if he had been in San
Francisco recently, and he shut up Kke
a dam.
**I have talked to officers before and It
always caused me. trouble," he said.
The man had evidently been drinking
heavily and at the jail to-night was in a
stupor. He retired to the far end of his
cell and would pay no attention to ques
tions. Sheriff Sibley is inclined to be skep
tical about Courtney's connection with
the case in which his name has been men
tioned and to-morrow an investigation
Â¦will be made as to his statement that
he was in the asylum for a while and was
..-ejrularly discharged therefrom.
There were no 'wounds on Courtnev and
his blind eye is not from a recent injury.
On his arrival here he begged for another
drink, but it was refused him.

merely of politics. The appointment by

Mayor Schmitz said last night that- he
would not recognize. "Windrow or approve
his bond. Resuming he said:
The Justices say they have the attor
neys of the San Francisco bar on their
side and that all haying business with^the
lower municipal court will aid Windrow's
light by refusing to recognize or do busi
ness with the Mayor's appointee. It is
well known that Sheriff Lackmann Is not
in sympathy with the administration and
that he refuses to recognize Fredrick to
the extent of refusing attachments bear
ing his signature. This attitude of the
Sheriff has in a measure paralyzed the
business of the Justices' Courts and if is
needless -to say that the latest develop
ments in the matter will not serve to dis
pel the gloom of the situation. Â¦â¢",;
The inauguration of business by Win
drow must necessarily result in confusion
so far , as the business of the Justices'
Court is concerned. The records of the
office are in charge of Fredrick, who re
fuses to give them up under any circum
stances. Without these records, which
are indispensable, Windrow admits his
operations will be perfunctory.' He is act
ing under the advice of his attorneys and
says he is willing to take the conse
quences. He holds that his appointment
is legal and that the position assumed by
rhe Mayor has no footing at law.
FREDRICK HOLDS RECORDS.
Believing that this notice would bring
the business of the office to him, Windrow
made arrangements to open his office at
the legal hour of 8 o'clock this morning.
He appointed as his clerks George Mc-
Comb and Robert W. Dennis, both hav
ing served for years under Williams. The
question of quarters was the next con
sideration. The Justices solved this mat
ter by offering: Windrow the use of Pre
siding Justice Daniels' chambers until
such time as the Sheriff might be able to
provide permanent quarters under the or
der of court. 'It was .decided also to direct
Sheriff Lackmann to equip the new office
with all the papers and paraphernalia
necessary for the transaction of the busi
ness of clerk of the Justices' Courts
. The unexpected removal by the Justices
of E. W. Williams after his resignation
had been sent to the Mayor and the sub
sequent, appointment of Windrow as his
successor will result in complications the
end of which no one can foresee. At a
meeting . of the Justices late yesterday
afternoon a* notice was issued to the bar
acquainting the attorneys of Windrow's
appointment .as clerk and ordering that
all filings must be made with him. The
notice further stated that all processes,
writs and orders must bear his signature
as clerk in order to meet with the recog
nition of the Justices.
JUSTICES NOTIFY BAB.
After .Windrow's attempt to. have his
bond approved the Mayor issued a state
ment in -which he announced his reasons
for appointing Fredrick in opposition to
the Justices. He declared that Windrow
was; one. of t5|e Crimmins "push" and
that the,. Justices were dominated by the
'same -political 'influence.*- The executive
declared -.open war. against, the City Hall
"push"; and announced that he Intended
to clean the City Hall of its corrupting
influence. . The statement was generally
recognized as a "warm document" and
those interested found much in it to think
about and discuss.
clined'.to approve it because, as he said,
it was not'worded in accordance with the
charter provisions. Attorney Riordan,
who represented Windrow, drew up an
other bond, but the Mayor found fault
with this, as It did not provide for.- the
turning over â¢ of all records and docu
ments to . a successor. This was again
remedied and Uhe amended botd will be
finally, submitted to the Mayor for his ap
proval to-day. That Mayor Schmitz is
determined to ignore ' Windrow and his

Owing to the suddenness .of the attack
and the darkness which prevailed at the
time Doherty did not observe how many
footpads * attacked him.-, but - he is - of the
opinion that there were two. ;
The robbery occurred on â¢ Mission street,
near the entrance to Dora street, between
Ninth and Tenth. Mission street at this
point, was in a state of being repaired
and part of the roadbed had been exca
vated. The footpads, who evidently had
been expecting the approach of Doherty,
waited until he reached the brink, of the
excavation and then struck him a power
ful blow on .the back of the neck. The
blow precipitated him into . the hole,
where he lay in a dazed state until . the
robbers took his money. In falling into
the .excavation Doherty * sustained a se
vere laceration of the nose and other in
juries about his face. â
street about C ' o'clock, he was waylaid
and after having been brutally beaten
was robbed of $40. The robbers did .not

OME OF GagS Of THUGS THATMURDERED POLICEMAN RQBiNSQR IS CAUGHT
The plain -.truth of the matter, therefore,
developed I for the first time under the search
light -of this inquiry, although .quite Inci
dentally, 13 that so far. as the Gloucester, thÂ«
Iowa, the Indiana, j the Texas and the Oregon
are concerned, - not â¢ the stroke of a ' propeller
blade, nor the touch of a helm, not the firing
of a shot,' was done under the direction or by
the orders of - Admiral >. Schley . during this
memorable battle.: â¢â¢â '. .-, - â¢ â¢ ..
-All this Is established- not -by theoretical de
ductions' or expert or. Inexpert opinion, bO'
by direct, positive, . unimpeached and unlm
peachable testimony, given under oath- by th<
admiral's brothers in arms.- Â¦Â¦Â¦ - . . Â¦â¢
The weight of the testimony is to the effec
that the commodore , controlled' the movement:
of his .flagship, the Brooklyn, well, with th(
exception of the loop. But it also shows, noi
negatively, but affirmatively and beyond ques
tion, that he did. not control the operations oi
the fleet in general' on that day. '
' The contention that the magnificent work
of the Oregon, or any part of it, was done
under orders from the Brooklyn, . or. that the
Oregon received and obeyed even a : single
order from Commodore Schley from tho timÂ«
the, Spanish ships were sighted" to the time
of the surrender of the Colon, which surrendei
mayfalrly.be taken as the close of the battle,
must be abandoned, 'and, with it goes the lasl
peg, with which to hang the pretense -of a
claim that during: the battle of Santiago Com
modore 'Schley effectively exercised any of the
functions of a "commander In chief. .
The question is not much one of possible
credit to but of possible censure of Admiral
Schley in connection with- the work of -that
vessel in -the battle | of Santiago. The plain
truth . is that Admiral Schley did not during
the- battle In- any way direct or control the
splendid performances of the Gloucester and
the three battleships, Indiana, Iowa and Texas,
The officers in command of these ships nelthei
received nor obeyed a solitary order from him.
The comment closes in the following
words: :\>; - *~
Deny That He Was in Command.
. Upon all the above-named features, believed
-by us to be the most Important, if not the
only really important, matters into which the
court made Inquiry, the conduct of Admiral
Schley . was condemned by that most distin
guished tribunal. , Admiral Dewey and Rear
Admirals Benham and Ramsey unite in their
findings and opinion upon all these several
points and they unite also In the . significant
recommendation that no further proceedings be
had "in view of the length of time which
has elapsed since the occurrence of the events
of the battle of Santiago." . .
The . commentators say they recognize
the fact that Admiral Schley devoted by
far. the larger part of his appeal to the
question of command, and consequently
gave that question a proportionate space
in their comment. They declare that the
question is between Sampson and Schley.
Both alike are interested, and to inves
tigate it fairly both should be heard.
Such incidental testimony on this point
as came before the court was on Schley's
side only, and the details were entirely
closed to Sampson. . .
The commentators next state: ' "\
If Commodore Schley were in absolute com
mand -.during the. battle,- and .If he had made
any use of . his authority, he must have ex
ercised some control over some of the vessels
participating.
Wainwright of the Gloucester said he saw
no orders from the Brooklyn; Taylor of the
Indiana said he saw no signals from the Brook
lyn; Evans of the Iowa said of the Brooklyn,
"I never saw. any signal, from her. I did not
maneuver in obedience to any signals from the
Brooklyn"; the commanding officer of tha
Texas is dead, â¢ but the officer's testimony
makes it clear that she received no orders, j

declare: , , ..

. WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.â The "com
ment" of Judge Advocate General Lemly
and Solicitor Hanna upon the appeal of
Admiral Schley, as submitted to ' the
President by Secretary Long, is less than
a third as long as the appeal itself. The
commentators begin with the statement
that Admiral Schley and his counsel have
shifted their ground. They say the chief
features of the case were the "retrograde
movement," "disobedience of orders,"
"Inaccurate and misleading official re-,
ports," "failure to destroy vessels' of the
enemy lying in sight," and "injustice to a
brother officer."
The commentators say: .

LOUISVILLE,/; Ky.V Jan. , SO.-^Admiral
Schley, as' the guest" of . the Louisville
Knights Templar,- had little opportunity
to rest to-day. -From r 10 o'clock -in the
morning, when he. visited the Girls' High
School, until he left the. Templar ball at
the Gait House at midnight, every mo
ment of his time was occupied. The great
er portion of the day was , spent among
children, and the admiral shook hands
with about 1000 boys and girls, who ex
pressed their pleasure by cheering their
visitor and presenting him with flowers.
This afternoon the most enthusiastic
demonstration of Admiral Schley*s visit
took place while he was leaving the Pen
dennis Club In a carriage which was to
take -him to the Masonic Widows' and
Orphans' Home. As he stepped into the
vehicle it was surrounded by hundreds of
cheering men, women and children, -who
had been gathering In the street. for half
an hour, and who pressed' around him
eager to shake his 'hand. The forward
movement of the admiral's carriage and
a platoon of mounted police who acted
as a guard of honor finally got the ad
miral clear of the crowd.
The ' day's programme for. the- enter
tainment of the .-Â¦â¢ admiral consisted of a
visit to the Girls'- High - School, followed
by a breakfast at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. Henry. Jefferson,, a T trip to ' the to
bacco breaks, a 'luncheon at the Penden

Edward and John Biddle found two
suits 'of clothes. They discarded their
prison attire, and when they left the Jail
they wore the ordinary clothing of pri

belonged to Warden Soffel.
Using the keys that had. been taken
from McGarry, Edward Biddle opened
two dungeons in the tier below those they
had occupied and thrust' McGarry, Rey

doors were swung, and locked and the
prisoners were then ready to take up the
easier work of escape. While this en
counter was going on the other occupants
of the prison went almost wild with ex

attract the attention of other guards. But
in this they were unsuccessful.

keys, threw him over the gallery rail

below. McGarry struck on his head and
shoulders and remained senseless where
"he fell. Attracted by the. noise of -the
struggle between McGarry and the mur
derers, George Kosslow and Charles
Reynolds, guards, rushed into* the cell
room. Edward Biddle grappled with
Reynolds, while "Jack'', gave his atten

than a match for his adversary* and
Jack Biddle, seeing this, broke away
from Kosslow and shot Reynolds through

later. Governor Stone was prevailed upon

It was Mrs. Kate Soffel, wife of War
den Peter Soffel, who was said to have
made it possible for these two murderers

The Prostate Glaad (so-called neck of blad-
der) is a structure very rich In nerves. Â¦ When
the terminations of these nerves are kept In a
eonstaunt state of excitement by chronic Inflam-
matory processes. It appears very clear that by
tranemiesion of this irritation to 'other nerves
the patient mar be subject to nervous phenom-
ena of the most varied character. Premature-
ness, Impotency, etc, are not weaknesses, but
crmptoms of this Inflammation. We have pre- I

When these symptoms begin to show
themselves medicine to-day knows but
this' one remedy, the famous discovery -of
Professor Edward E. Phelps, M. D.,
LL. D., whose wonderful achievement has
spread the fame of one of this country's
greatest universities. No other 'remedy
was ever universally prescribed by phy-
sicians. It was by the advice of the most
eminent practitioners in the country that
In one person the diseased condition of
the nerves manifests itself in ipsomnia;
In another by indigestion; in another by
rheumatism; some organ of the human
body becomes affected, and ' refuses to
perform its proper work.
More than nine-tenths of all diseases
that are not infectious are known by
every physician 'to be merely the local
symptoms of a coming break-down of the
nervous system.
The nerves control and determine the
health of. every function of the brain and
body. s '
this great remedy was first put within
th6 reach of the public. Paine's Celery
Compound is not in any way a patent
medicine. It is so superior to" all the so-
called remedies that n,o serious compari-
son can be made between them.
The formula of Palne's Celery Com-
pound has been freely furnished from the
first to reputable physicians anywhere,
and the thousands of authenticated cases
that are reported yearly by physicians of
every school have 'proved beyond ques-
tion that In every, case of dyspepsia, bil-
iousness, liver complaint, 'neuralgia, rheu-
matism or other diseases that imply im-
paired nerves, Palne's Celery Compound
Invariably gives lasting relief.*
It succeeds again and again In com-
pletely curing diseases -where everything
else has failed. It Is the only prepared
remedy in the world that is openly and
publicly Indorsed by medical Journals. A
single trial of Paine" a Celery Compound
will convince any one that It accom-
plishes In every case all that it is claimed
to do. ' .

Business as well as social life of today is one of strain and effort j and the
struggle for existence in competition makes life a fight clay in day out, inwhich
care of body, nerves, blood is more or less neglected. Men wonder what'3
wrong with them. No man can stand such unnatural conditions unless ho
counteracts them by using Cascarets Candy Cathartic, causing regularity of
body in spite of irregularity of habits. A man who "feels bad" should take
Cascarets, find out what's wrong and be cured. .

No one "could complain about the size of

at the performance, which was in ; every

the greater draw.

ing in New York, Pennsylvania, Wiscon
sin, Minnnesota and Washington. The
company will commence work with 600
men, ultimately increasing the number to
3000.
The company has obtained control of
2000 acres of Texada Island lands which
are rich in iron, coal and copper. These
include bog iron mines which furnish an
ore supsly for the blast furnace at Iron
dale. Options nave been obtained on fur
ther Iroit^ lands on Vancouver Island and
in Skagit County, and a large number of
coke ovens.
The 'xaconia men concerned had been
actively at work matting purchases and
securing leases ana options before any
publicity was given to their plans. Their
object was to iollow the plan of the stetl
trust by securing control of the necessary
bases of the ore supply. This has beeu
accomplished and they are ready to com

site secured on the Tacoma tide lands can
be made ready.

SxwcUd Dispatch to The Call.
The report of the Parliamentary com
mittee appointed to Investigate the
charges of bribery and corruption made
by Sir John Blundell Maple (Conserva
tive) against the British officers who
purchased army horses in Austria-Hun
gary censures Sir . John for unjustifiable
attacks on the Integrity of the officers.
At the same time, however, the commit
tee finds that an excessive price was paid,
whereby horse dealers were, enabled to
divide a profit of about ?15 on. horses
which cost the contractors Â£12 to Â£17.
The committee also expresses surprise at
the. fact that the Government remount
department took no step3 to ascertain the
best sources of supply in Hungary until
the South African war had been in pro
gress for six months, thereby involving
.the country in, a loss of Â£12,000 on a sin

LONDON, Jan. 3O.-The report that

would begin this week, but, nothing has
since been heard of his case.

A correspondent was informed in offi

Holland's action was quite spontaneous.
France was not consulted and is not

PARIS; Jan. 30.â The Temps to-day
prints a dispatch from The Hague, in
which the correspondent says he learns
from a trustworthy source that the re r
cent journey of the Dutch Premier, DrI
Kuyper, to England prepared the way
for peace negotiations in regard to South
Africa, which were begun with the con
sent of the British Government. He adds
that the more recent step taken 'by Hol
land was supported by some of the other
governments.
In the meanwhile the Associated Press
is able to confirm "the statement that -the
Government of the Netherlands'suggest
ed granting a safe conduct to a Dutch
commission to be -appointed for the pur
pose of conferring with the fighting
burghers and enlightening them as to the
real position of affairs.
LONDON, Jan. 30.â Answering a ques
tion on the subject in the House of Com
mons to-day,, the Government leader, A.
J. Balfour, said that as the reply, of the
British Government to \ th&. communica
tion of the Government, of the Nether
lands on the subject of the South Afri
can war would not reach The Hague un
til January 31, it was impossible for his
Majesty's Government to give the House
the papers this week.

CALL, BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N. : W., WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.â The
Government of the Netherlands has in*
formally approached the United States
Government with the understood purpose
of securing Its aid to induce Great Brit
ain 1 to consent to - treating with the
Boers. The matter has been discussed
by Secretary Hay with members ot the
diplomatic corps, notably with Baron
Gevers, Minister of ."Holland, and pre
sumably with Lord Paunccfote, the. Brit
ish Embassador, but in no case has 'the
mattter ever progressed beyond ver
bal exchanges. Baron Gevers was at
the State Department to-day ana had a
brief conversation with Kay. In the
talKs between the Secretary of State and
the Minister of Holland neither official
committed his Government in any way,
no suggestion or proposal beir.j. reduced
to writing. Neither side has regarded
these exchanges of views as official,'al
though notes of the conversation may
have been made, and with propriety, for
the information of the Dutch Govern
ment and President Roosevelt. -
The attitude of the present administra
tion is similar to that of the administra
tion of McKinley. This Government is ad
hering to the rule that In war between
civilized nations an offer of mediation
cannot properly be made unless both'

Known that such offer, will be favorably

he went as far as he deemed proper in
suggesting to Great Britain that ; the
United States Government would be glad
to serve as mediator for the transmission
of any message to the Boers. The re

the purpose of that Government to con

frequent appeals to the State Department

SANTA ANA, Jan. 30.â This city was
startled to-night shortly after 9 o'clock
by a terrific explosion. Many citizens
started on a search for the cause and the
Southern^ Pacific i platform . on Second
street was found badly wrecked. Some
explosive, the nature of which has not
yet been learned, had been placed under
the structure, and it was thrown about
in a manner that indicated an unusually
powerful force. \ . ,
About half an hour later another but
lighter .explosion occurred, this time in
the woodpile of a local dealer, but with
little damage. Monday night a water
pipe was loaded with some powerful ex
plosive and discharged about midnight,
causing a good deal of alarm. The offi

-The only explanation Captain Tuttle

became of her then no one pretends to

- Two Texans testified to-day. They were
Emanuel Raphael, secretary and manager
of the Houston Clearing-house, and also
a trustee of the Rice Institute, and Ar
thur B. j Cohn, clerk and agent of W. M.
Rice at Houston. Raphael told of the
plans for the Rice Institute. He swore he
was familiar with Rice's signature and
that the signatures on the checks, the as
signment of the Rice estate to Patrick
and the paper- which revoked Captain
Baker's right to Rice's safety deposit box
were forgeries. â¢ Â¦ â¢
-Cohn swore the signatures to the 1900
will, the checks and the assignment were
not genuine.
The cross-examination of Blinn by coun
sel for the defense brought out that there
was an arrangement by which, the wit
ness was to receive $75,000 from, the Rice
Institute if the 1896 will was admitted to
probate. Under this 189C will Blinn's share
was $5000. Witness said that the arrange
ment was in writing. It came from
Colonel Joseph Rice (William Rice's
nephew^ and he (Blinn) had signed the
paper.
Following the evidence of Banker Nor
man S. Meldrum, who was again on the
stand to-day, that the signature to the
assignment of Rice's estate , to Patrick
was a forgery, and that the signature to
the 1896 will was genuine, came the testi
mony of Joseph L,. Blinn of Springfield,
Mass., a nephew of the dead man. Blinn
told of being-, summoned to New York by
Patrick, and said the latter told him he
(Blinn) was to get $30,000 of the estate
under the 1900 or Patrick will.

From the first ro'und/ in which Green
was forced to take the /count, until the
decisive blow was landed, the result was
never In doubt. Ryan was the aggressor
throughout, s Green being unable to with-'
st Â» n <i the furious rushes of his opponent.
in the first round Ryan made It appar
ent that it was to be a fast flght so far
as his side of the argument was con
cerned. " After knocking Green over the
ropes^with a hard right in the ribs he
landed again with his left on Green's
jaw with such. telling effect that the lat
ter was forced to take the count.
In the next round Ryan rained body
blows on his opponent, whose distress
caused him again to go to his knees for
five seconds. Just before the bell sounded
Kyan again knocked Green through thy
ropes. Green made his best showing in
the third round, when" he landed a half
dozen times,, but without apparent effect
on Ryan. ,
In the beginning: of the next round
Rya n landed a clean right on the Jaw,
which' knocked . Green, down. After this
Green was in Â¦ great distress and ran
around the ring to avoid his opponent.
Ryan was waiting to land a knock-out
punch, and after one minute and twenty
seconds in the seventh round,\ quick as
a, flash, he landed another right on the
jaw and Green went flat on his back.
Green was counted out and had to be
carried to his dressing-room and revived
with some difficulty.

KANSAS CITY, Jan. 30.â Tommy Ryan
of- this city, who claims the middle
weight championship . of the . world,
knocked out George Green of ' San
Francisco to-night in the seventh round
of what was scheduled as . a ten-round
contest before a large attendance in
Armory Hall. .,
It -was decided that the amateur rule
prohibiting boxers from appearing under
assumed names will be strictly enforced.
The matter has created a sensation
among amateur athletes, owing to the
prominence of the accused.- The present
officials of the association seem to think
it casts a reflection on them and are In
tent on having a thorough investigation of
the charges which have been hinted at
. for some time. .
The meeting resulted in putting: amateur
boxing in what appears to be a healthy
: condition. It is not a sport which adapts
itself readily to amateur laws, but the
.promoters have met the governing body
Â¦more than naif way and good results are
Â¦ expected.
W. B. â¢ Harrington represented the San
Francisco Athletic Club, Dan Crowley the
Bay City Athletic Clnb and Morris Levy
the Hayes Valley Club. They agreed to
match only registered amateurs. For
prizes they will give merchandise orders,
but no. cash. . . .
The action recently taken suspending
the San Francisco and Bay City clubs
was rescinded. It was found the Hayes
Valley Club haul never , qauliiled as a
member, its membership fee of $7 50 not
having been paid. Mr. Levy paid this and
the club -was declared a member of the
association. The clubs will be represented
at each monthly meeting of the associa
tion hereafter.
President W. B. Hlnchman of the asso
ciation will prefer charges to-day .and the
accused will be given a hearing on Feb
ruary 13. Morris .Levy of the Hayes Val
ley Athletic Club has been ordered to uro
<luce a letter written by the accused, In
which a demand is said to be made for
money. *
Grave accusations were made last night
*t a meeting held in the Olympic Club
against a man who for years has held a
prominent position in connection with
amateur athletics. It is claimed he ex
; acted $20 from the Hayes Valley Athletic
Club as a membership Â£ee in the Pacific
Association of Amateur Athletic .Union,
and also that he collected registration fees
â¢from many athletes, chiefly boxers, for
which he has never accounted in full to
the association. He issued registration
cards bearing' only his signature, when
they require those of three members of a
committee especially named for that duty.

The oars, etc.. partially submerged and
presenting less surface to the gale, would
move through the water only one mile
where the boat would drift a distance of
lour or five miles, and that explains why
the few articles from the collier were
washed ashore south of the cape by the
waves, and the man-of-war's lifeboat
drifted on the sands a considerable dis
tance farther north on the coast of Van
couver Island.
This theory is further borne out by the
finding of wreckage from the Condor and
the Matteawan. There were life preserv
ers, a medicine chest, doors, oars, etc.,
identified positively as having belonged
to the collier, picked up by Indians six
miles south of Cape Flattery. And at a
point near Ahousette, on the Vancouver
Island coast, has been picked up a life
boat from the Condor. The reason the
lifeboat was not found near where the
Matteawan wreckage was located is ex
plained by the well-known fact thai wind
would act with greater force on the high
exposed sides of a small boat than on de
bris which sets low in the water. â¢
Mariners who ere not given to imagin
ing things and whose veracity cannot be
doubted are more than inclined to be
lieve that the Matteawan put back for
shelter at Neah and at some point near
and undoubtedly southward of Cape Flat
tery collided with the Condor. The terri
ble marine tragedy which would follow
such a collision, sending so many human
beings to watery graves, is their explana
tion of the awful mystery which shrouds
the fatÂ« of the missine craft.
The Condor and the Matteawan
caught in the same etorm. Passing from
the straits their course lay to the south
ward. For a distance of perhaps twenty
miles it lay in the same direction, follow
ing the route for steam vessels. The Mat
'leawan was noticed in the afternoon by
the weather observer at Neah Bay, six
miles from the termination of the cape.
He also reported to the local office and
siill later Captain Hasdorfl of the light
ship stationed fourteen miles south of
Cape Flattery, and anchored off Flattery
rocks, noted the steamer southward
bound about- two miles off and evidently
in distress.
They departed from Ladysmlth and Vic
toria, B. C, respectively, on December 3,
end were last seen passing outward from
Cape Flattery during the beginning of a
storm. Outside of some Identified wreck
age from the man-of-war and the collier
nothing has since been seen or heard of
them or of their crews.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. SO.â Did the col
lier Matteawan and H.MXS. Condor col
lide off Cape Flattery and go to the bot
tom? An affirmative answer to this ques
tion is the theory which has been made
plausible by facts just beginning to come
to :igrht and which may possibly explain

WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.â To-day's ses
sion of the Senate was entirely void of the
tumultuous scenes which characterized
the sessions of the past- three days. After
the Philippine tariff measure was taken
up at 2 o'clock, Tlllman delivered a speech
devoted almost entirely to discussion of
the part his State took in the war of the
Independence of the colonies. Incident
ally he referred occasionally to the pend
ing bill, drawing morals, as he said, for
the benefit of the majority, that they
might be applied, to the Philippines.
Among the bills passed were the follow
ing: Adding. $1,500,000 to the cost of the
public building at San Francisco; to in
crease ,the limit, of cost of the- public
building at Butte, Mont., from $225,000 to
$400,000; to provide for the establishment
of a light and fog signal station on one
of the mile rocks, San Francisco. Bay; to
establish a fog bell and lens lantern light
on the southeastern end of Southampton
shoal, San Francisco Bay; to establish a
light and fog signal at a point on Car
quinez Strait, California, opposite that
now occupied by the Selby Smelting
Works; for the construction of a light
ship for Blunt's reef, Pacific Ocean, off
Cape Mendocino; to establish a tog sig
nal at Fort WInfleld Scott,' Fort Point,
California; fixing the compensation of
district superintendents in the lif e-saving
service* at $2000 per annum; appropriating

WASHINGTON, Jan. 30.â Senator Raw
lins lntrcduced a resolution making In
quiry of tho Secretary of War whether
"the treason act In the Philippines" has
been passed by the Philippine Commis
sion. The resolution cites a circular pur
porting to give the language of the act.
One yo vision makes the concealment of
treason against the United States .or the
Philippines punishable by a fine of $1000
and imprisonment for seven years;, one
provides for a fine of $2000 and imprison
ment for two years for uttering seditious
words, and a third provides a fine of $1000'
and Imprisonment for one year for per
sons be-onging to secret societies having
for their object the promotion of treason.
Another prohibition is against advocating
the independence of the Philippines or
their separation from the United States,
"whether by peaceable or forcible
means." The penalty for the Infraction
of this requirement is a fine of $2000 and
Imprisonment for a year. The resolution
went ovei for future consideration.
Secretary Long to-day received the fol
lowing cablegrams from Rear Admiral
Kcdgers at Cavite, concerning the march
of the marines across Samar:

On Tuesday, last" the' executive commit

would be for the best interests of the club
to defer consideration of the ; proposed
admittance of colored delegates to the
coming convention of the General Fed
eration of Women's Clubs,. but at a sub
sequent meeting of the- Â¦ members of the
organization its action Â¦ was ignored and
they voted to instruct their delegates to
the â¢ coming ' convention to vote for the
erasure of the color line. As Mrs. White
was ex offlcio a member of the â¢ delega
tion, she found . she could not abide by
these â¢instructions and therefore handed,
in her. resignation. . â¢
In ; explanation of her action Mrs.
White states that the California Club was
organized to do practical work, and while
the discussion of the â¢ race question and
other ethical questions were in its prov
ince, the members were expected to direct
their energies', to -more, practical matters.
She said the club on January 21 in
structed its delegation to the coming con
vention to vote in favor of admitting col
ored clubs to the General , Federation of
Women's Clubs, and. as a -delegate, she
must accept these instructions or resign.
Mrs. White | was . in : accord with the fol

Mrs. Lovell White, for many years
president of tho California Club, relin

We ought not to forget that the heart fire
kindled at the nuptial altar is but the begin
ning- of true love and fidelity that spring- from
the throne of heaven and are finding their way
into conjugal purity and holiness.
It is not good that man should be alone,
they argue, does not necessarily- require the
spiritual union through the priest at the nup
tial altar. Here again, in this blessed country
of freedom, the old and sacred adage "Mar
riages are made in heaven," as a general rule,
are being made by the telephone. â¢ ,'
The charming tones of the most exalted song
that stirred the heart and soul of the Ameri
can people, " "Home, Sweet Home," can often
be heard by those who sell their honor, con
science and virtue for money or passion. The
fragrant flowers that were culled from the
garden of matrimony called love, . sympathy, :
kindness, reverence and affection, have at this
age of materialism been substituted by the
lust for nice adornment and luxurious display
in their parlors. But, alas, these are mistakes
which Insist upon payment. Those that de
grade the sacredness of the sweet, romantic
Illusion "of true love by egotistic purposes have
written their verdict with their own hands.
There are other cases in matrimonial life
that are of so delicate a nature that I dare
not touch upon them with more than a word.
We often observe marrntges whose character,
creed and race are so differently molded that
after a year or two. when the perfume of thÂ»
orange blossoms has wafted away, become
aliens to *ach other. But can these indivld
ils accuse Providence for the unhappiness of
uter years? It would certainly be unsafe to
make those kind of unions the schools of moral
ity. We, to whom the noblest traits of virtue
have been intrusted by divine law and sealed
with the finger of God, "therefore shall man
ieave his father and mother and shall cleave
unto his wife," which unequivocally means his
legal wife assigned to him by providence, ought
to consider It a fortunate chance and ousht
to show ourselves worthy of the blessings
which marriage has aided in finding the one
and only woman, the bne and only man on
this' globe to make up the full measure of
their lives. .
In France and in the larger cities of Europe
there is a vulgar prejudice against the old
matrimonial system. Marriage, the inexor
able law of nature, the foundation of all social
and moral development, the loftiest institu
tion for all mankind, they declare irrational
and a failure. Modern philosophers and psy
chologists even attempted to destroy the Idyllic
home of family life by terming marriage "The
grave of love and affection."
Rabbi Bergman, who is a thorough stu
dent of theology and philosophy, treated
the subject in a most convincing manner.
He said:
The Rev. Dr. Bergman lectured on
"Marriage and Intermarriage" last even

now before our honorable Board of Supervisors
in the form, of what Is known as the proposed
Lynch bill, which provides for a period of
sixty days' racing In any one year, and which
is to be acted on by said, board on Monday
next, February 3, 1902; and
Whereas, Said bill, if passed, would be lu
substance what thousands of our best citizens,
time and again,' have vigorously opposed | be
cause it would open the gates to all the evil
and . pernicious influences of racetrack gam
bling In our midst; and
Whereas, The support. of said bill is being
drawn largely from the elements who care
more for gambling and the things which make
for violation of law than for the things which
make for the best home life and morals of
our city as also its best financial interests;
therefore; be it ' Â¦ '
Resolved, That we the members and frlenda
of the Law and Order League, in annual con
vention assembled, record our public protest
to the passage of the proposed Lynch bill.
The'Law and Order League at a meeting
last night at the Academy of Sciences
launched a movement against the reopen
of Ingleside racetrack. Condemnatory res
olutions were 'adopted, Â¦ and a committee
of five was appointed to' appear before
the Supervisors next Monday, and at any
adjourned meeting at which the Lynch
bill may. be a subject for consideration,
and oppose the passage of that measure.
The resolutions, which were offered by
J. W. Rogers and adopted by n. practical
ly unanimous rising vote, were as follows:
Opposition Before the
Supervisors.
Committee' Appointed to Lead
Law 'and Order League
to Oppose Reopen
ing Ingleside.
RHDY TO FIGHT
THE LYNCH BILL
THE SAN FRANCISCO .CALL, FRIDAY, JANTJARY 31, 1902;
recent arrest of Dr. Phillip Carroll, who is Dep
uty Consul General of the United States. It is stated that
he was forcibly taken to the. penitentiary and 'confined there
in a room for several hours with prisoners convicted of mur
der. It is further asserted that Dr. Carroll was arrested on
a trumped-up charge of assault, a criminal charge being the
only kind -under which a consular officer could be arrested. '
He has just returned from a visit of. several weeks to his
home in Ohio. A few days after his departure for Ohio an
old Mexican servant who had been employed in Dr. Car- :
roll's house was picked up on the street badly bruised about
the head. He was taken to the hospital, and there made the
charge of assault against Dr. Carroll. It is claimed by
many prominent Americans of Monterey that the charge
against Carroll was trumped up on account of his sturdy de
fense of American interests in his official capacity in the
past.
AUSTIN, Tex., Jan. 30. â A dispatch from Monterey,
Mexico, says that the members of the American
colony of that city are . greatly aroused over the
Special Dispatch to The Call.

j PERSONAL MENTION.
The station at Point Reyes and. its ac
cessories have been speedily provided. The
WeatKer Bureau at Washington, hasten
ing to give the added facilities to tbia
port beore the present season would close,
sent on all orders telegraphically. In this
patriotic policy others co-operated. Reid
offices of the Weather Bureau in this city.
Promptly news from the far sea is thus
placed In easy reach of the commercial
community of Sari Francisco. The sig
nificance of the completion of the Point
Reyes institution is readily seen^.especlal
ly when Mr. McAdie says that this is
only the beginning of the campaign to im
prove the commercial facilities of this
port by putting the shipping in close
touch with the land. v 'Â¦' v
A .CHANCE TO SMILE
5 The equipment is complete. In addition
to the great advantages that the station
may confer upon the shipping interests
of San Francisco it also serves as an out
post from which to observe incoming
storms early, and from, this the agri
cultural Industry -will ! receive benefit. In
the station are seven rooms and also tha
observatory, which is entered from the
dwelling. The signal tower of steel, upon
which six-foot flags are set, has a hoist
ins apparatus in the station, so that sis â
nals can be displayed in the most severe
gales upon the wind-swept helght3 with
out danger to the operator. The stepl
tower duplicates the one recently placed
at Point Lotos. It is 75 feet high. The
official in charge of the new station is \V.
W. Thomas. The cost of the station was
only J300O. Mr. McAdie says that at least
twenty miles more of distance at sea than
could formerly be scanned is now under
observation In clear weather.
Bros., the architects, gave the plans for
the station the right of way over other
wprk and refused to accept a fee for their
services, which were given freely. AD tfce
brick and other building material had to
be carried from' this city to Point Reyes
by schooners. Builders, notwithstanding
that business has been rushlmj In this
city, co-operated, to aid in the prevailinff
haste. . The material was beached at
Drakes Bay, at the precise sqpt where
history says that stout Admiral Draka
landed on California soil. The work oÂ£
building began on November 1, and the
structure was ready for its apparatus
and occupants on the first day of the pres
ent year.

The nation -has now a larger revenue than it needs.
The surplus in the treasury is large and is increasing.
Such a condition of affairs naturally encourages
travagance in the way of appropriations arid leads
the Government " into undertaking work that is un
necessary and wasteful of. national wealth. Of course
if the Â¦ money were -wisely expended a great, benefit
could be obtained from it, but whenever large and
liberal appropriations are to be made there U a
scramble for the spoils, and log-rolling rather than
statesmanship .determines the result.
The repeal of certain "of the war taxes by the last
Congress wifh the design of reducing the revenue
did not have that effect. The prosperity of the peo

REPORTS from Washington that the Republi-.

mittee of the House are about agreed upon a
policy of repealing nearly the whole if not all. the war
taxes will be well received by the country. These
taxes were imposed to meet the emergency occasioned
by the war with Spain. The act imposing them was
hastily drawn up, was not well digested and has never
been thoroughly revised. The consequence is that
from the first it has been unsatisfactory, and there
will be a general feeling of gratification when it is
abolished. â¢

Here, then, is an ample explanation of the "finan

iave been prompt in getting possession of Cuban
estates. American home industry is to be sacrificed

THE AMERICAN CLUB.
W.A. MERCHANT. President.
HAVANA, Jan. 23.â American interests in Cuba, ag
gregating about eighty million dollars, urge your body
to Immediately exert every effort possible, through
Â»very channel of influence at your command, to have
Congress grant tariff concessions asked for by Cuban
Finally the New York papers report that . the
Merchants' Association of that city recently received
Some light on the situation is thrown by evidence
recently submitted to the Ways and Means Commit
tee of the House. There has been read before that
body a telegram from the president of a Detroit com
mercial organization saying that Oscar Stillmari has
started for Cuba under instructions from ihe sugar
?trust to obtain options on all available sugar land. It
was further brought out that the stockholders pf the
National Sugar Company â¬ have purchased estates in
Cuba aggregating about 77,000 acres. Another in
teresting bit of evidence was to the effect that up
ward of 130 estates in Cuba are now grinding cane
*nd withholding the sugar from the market in expec
tation of tariff concessions.
The plea for free trade is made upon the ground
that the Cuban planters have been ruined by the long
war with Spain, that their ruin has brought distress
and poverty upon the people generally/ that the isl
and is well nigh bankrupt, and that if we.do not give
the sugar planters free access to our markets the im
poverishment. of the country will result in the most
dire calamities. If those reports be true, the money
which sustains the lobby at Washington and sends
forth the endless stream of "literature" cannot come
from the Cubans. No people so near ruin and bank
ruptcy as we are told the Cubans are could provide
6uch ample funds. Either the plea of the free-traders
is based upon falsehood or else the fight is being
made by other parties.
ONE of the notable features of the fight made
for the purpose of breaking down the
American protective system in the interest
of the Cuban sugar planters is the seemingly unlim
ited amount of money at the disposal of the advo
cates of the proposition. They are not only able to
maintain a strong lobby at Washington employing
high-priced counsel, but to publish and flood the
country with documents and pamphlets in favor of
free trade with Cuba. In short, it appears that.what
ever means they may deem expedient to use in
making their fight the money to supply it is promptly
forthcoming, and it is a matter of public interest to
know the source of the supply.
A QUESTION OF COIN.
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
pÂ»r|-=^ HE accompanying picture gives
I the public its first glance of the
IB highly important 'weather station,
UL observatory and ' signal tower
â¢;,^ which the United States Govern
ment has just completed upon the lofty
headland of Point Reyes, 690 feet above
the sea level. From that elevated position
the sea is commanded in all directions for
a distance of fifty miles. This means that
the horizon of San Francisco for maritime
purposes has been largely widened. Far
out upon the ocean vessels that wouhl
heretofore liave been indistinguishable
are now picked up by the powerful tele
jBcopic lens made especially in Paris for
the observatory. In the station is a tele
phone that connects directly with the
Of course money cannot accomplish everything.
It is quite possible the funds may be used to sup
ply ease and affluence for men who will find their dig
nity so comfortable they will not deem ft a duty to
work hard. That, not infrequently happens, and the
best work in the world has not been done by men
who had assured incomes. 'Still the hope entertained
by the founder of the new institute may be reasonably
shared by the public. The aim is "to secure, if pos
sible, for the United States of America leadership in
the â¢ domain' of inquiry and the utilization of new
foices for the benefit of mankind." May success at
tend it.
The institution is fortunate also in the direction
given to its activities.- The country can well under
stand and sympathize with the: statement of the
founder: "It cost some effort to push" aside the
tempting idea of a Washington University founded
by, Andrew Carnegie." The desire of the first Presi
dent of the Union, the Father of the -Republic, to
establish at the national capital a great national uni
versity has long been felt as in some measure im
posing upon posterity a duty to realize the desire.
Many efforts have been made to accomplish it, and
very naturally Mr. Carnegie must have felt that it
would be a high honor for .him to fulfill the earnest
wish of Washington. He has, however, surren
dered that ambitjon and, in accord with the judgment
of those- best fitted .to give counsel in. such matters,
lias left the establishment -of the university to an
other person or to a future time and has devoted his
donation to founding an institute which will in no
wise conflict with existing universities, but will
rather aid them all by providing funds for the pro
motion of original research. â¢ '.';
Such an institution has long been needed. We have
colleges and universities enough, but we have been'
lacking in endowments providing for research
rather: than instruction! The t .result is that we are
behind other nations' in the great work'of advancing
science. We profit promptly by what others do, but
we do not lead the way." Our professors have been
compelled to give too much of their time tothe'in- i
structiqn of students, to be able to prosecute with
success the studies and experiments necessary '. to.
bring to light new truths of science. It is the aim
of the Carnegie foundation to supply funds for the
support of such students arid to provide them , with'
rr.eans for pursuing their studies. "If is therefore a
benefit to every' existing university and will co
operate with them in the work of advancing learning
and incu-asing the store'of human knowledge.
It starts under the fairest auspices. TheMocation is
excellent. No city better fitted for the operation . of
Buch'an institution could be found "on the -'globe.
Washington not only has a present vast store Â¦ of ma
terial worthy of the investigation of students,
but as the years pass the store .will immensely
increase. The financial* condition of the in
stitute is solid and . promising./ The ; $10,000,000
endowment with which it starts \ is suffi
cient, to insure it a career of useful activity, and it
will doubtless be largely increased in the future. The
trustees are among the foremost men in the nation/
and the president, Daniel Coit Gilman, has already
proven, his capacity in the administration- of institu
tions of learning, so that the funds of the institute
will from the' start be employed by a man who knows
from long experience how best 'to apply them to the
desired end. â¢:..../
GARNEGIE INSTITUTE has! taken jits place
among the established educational \ institu*
tions of the country.' The trustees have or
ganized themselves into a board of control, the en
dowment fund has been turned over to their ;carÂ«
and a president has'been chosen to carry on the work.-
All has been effected in due order and the institute
is launched upon its-career. . - : ''; .

A missionary in the Philippines says that all of the

whelming conviction of their unworth.
But, after all, would salted hides and pickled ears
settle the miracles? Would if restore faith to the
doubting? We fear not. â¢ Heresy must be â¢ fought
with something besides salt hides, vinegar and ruin
of the millinery business.
Â¦ & Â¦ . . . -_ - . -
What a pity that Elder Hardin lacks the power to
proceed. What could be more picturesque than skin
ning the professor of literature Â«nd salting his hide
for admonitory purposes, . and \ then standing the
flayed heretic on his head and pouring vinegar in his
ears! Even leaving to hinrhis skin, the spectacle of
this scholar head down with* ears full of vinegar
would draw a crowd in any city in the United States.
All of the clerics have not been content to explain
the miracle on the asbestos or cold-storage theories."
They have attacked Professor Pearson more di
rectly. One of them is Presiding Elder Hardin,. who
in. a meeting of ministers discussing Professor Pear
son said: "I think here is an opportunity to make
an example of a man who under the wing of the
church denies its fundamental truths.. If I had the
power and ability to deal with Professor Pearson I
would skin him, salt his hide and tack it on the barn
door before the ordinary preacher could sharpen his
jackknife on his bootleg. I would stand him on his
head and pour vinegar in both ears and let him re
main that way until he got- some, sense."
That kind of talk will make^ no headway against
Professor Pearson. It is highly probable that Mrs.
Parkhurst has recently bought a new bonnet and ex
cited the ire of the doctor.
Dr. Parkhurst rather diluted his theory by frivolity.
Passing from asbestos to other subjects, he. said the
greatest of the Christian miracles is the power to
curb the appetites, and he declared: "One of these
is the appetite, the pleasure, of sight. - Take that ap
petite out of humanity and every millinery store
would go out of business and fashion would go to
We turn now to some of the ordained friends of
the miracles. One of them, Rev. Mr. Parkhurst, im
mediately preached to a Chicago, congregation an
anti-Pearson and pro-miracle sermon, in which he
contended that when Shadrach, Meshach and Abed
nego refused to bow down to the image of the
Babylonian King and were put into the furnace for
it they were for the time being transformed into
asbestos, and r thus fire-proofed, defied the great heat
and came out unscathed. Dr. Parkhurst described
this fire-proofing .process at great length, and is said
to have left his audience wondering why it is not ap
plied to many people in these days, as worthy as the
three Arabians, who are grilled in burning buildings
and reduced to ashes. .Another has proceeded to ex
plain the same miracle by insisting that the children
were not fire-proofed, bufc the flames were deprived
of heat, and they sat on the coals and in the blaze and
shivered with the cold. Who can dispute either
statement? Surely it is as easy to take the heat out
of fire as to "change flesh and blood to asbestos?
It is true that all forms of the religious idea have
been adumbrated by miracles and marvels, and that
the Brahmins before Buddha and Buddha beforo
Christ are credited with miracles more extraordinary
than any" performed under the old or the new dispen
sation. . Indeed Zoroaster, long before Buddha, made
the three Arabian children look like thirty cents, as
far as the fire test is concerned, for he was swept into
the grate and burned to a clinker, and came out re
freshed as from a sweet sleep, and founded the sect of
fire worshipers, which subsists, to this day in the
great community of Parsees in Bombay, and an ex
cellent people they are, too. But, while we may look
with a cold heart upon the miracles which preceded
Christianity, we see at once that one who' denies them
has no right in the great Buddhist university of Cey
lon, nor in the te^nples of Krishna, nor the Tower
of Silence. The same rule applies to Professor Peaf^
son in a Methodist university; he must be consistent
and get out of that, and seoff at miracles from the
outside ar.d not the inside of a" miracle teaching
communion. So much for; Pearson, ile has the
courage of his convictions, but he cannot enjoy the
luxury of such convictions and a Methodist salary at
the same time.
This appears to have ' been done by Professor
Pearson, who announces his disbelief in the miracle*
recorded in the Old and New Testaments.. He hat
gone to the" extent of making out a list of those
interesting events which he boldly repudiates. The
list begins with the torrid experience of Shadrach,
Meshach and Abed-nego in the fiery furnace and
comes down to the raising of the dead son of tho
widow of Nain. It is our deliberate conviction that
Professor Pearson should have resigned his place in
a Methodist university before turning loose on these
miracles, belief in which is an article in the creed of
that church. , .

Gustav Allsted, the carpenter who shot
and killed Thomas Normile on Bernal
Heights Wednesday night, claims that he
acted In , defense of f the honor of the
woman from whom he had been granted
a divorce at noon ol that same day. He
says that he forgot the divorce and
thought of her oniy as his wjfe and the
mother of his children. Â¦
Allsted insists that- Normile was chok
ing the woman and that doubtless he
would not have let her live to be a wit
ness aeainst him. ; Â» *
Mrs. Allsted has been allowed to re
main at her home, 51 EZast Park. Allsted
was arraigned in Judge Cabaniss' court
yesterday morning on a charge of murder
preferred by Police Officer H. C. Schmitt,
and wae instructed as to his rights, and
the case continued till to-morrow, i
Allsted, who is 51 old, was grant
ed a divorce from his wife by Judge Ker
rigan Wednesday on the ground of habit
ual intemperance. He and their sona,
aged IS and 15, testified that she drank,
habitually and was grossly intoxicated on
an average of five times a week.- Mrs.
Allsted is 57 years old and has the appear
ance of being even older.
No rmile's slayer expresses no regret for
his deed and says he has no fear of the
outcome. He does not believe that any
jury will convict him. "*
Allsted * has a visual peculiarity that
had much to do with the fatal ending of
Normlle's orgie. The pupil of one of his
eyes is abnormally large,, and in conse
quence he says he can see in the dark
like an owl. He shot from a distance of
thirty . feet, simply pointing his rifle in
the direction of Normile's head; which
he saw plainly. That he struck .Normile
and not Mrs. Allsted was largely the re
sult of chance." - - - - - .
Mrs. Normile is prostrated by her hus
band's death and is loth to believe, any
thing reflecting upon his honor.

egaln showed its rympathy with Amalgamated
Copper. The dealings in this stock were aixnu
twice as preÂ».t as those in Sugar and the'tran
sactions in the two stocks combined were an
overwhelming proportion of the aggregate. The
speculation In Amalgamated Copper, while very
active, was accompanied by much : confusion
cf sentiment regarding the actual developments
In the trade' and their bearings on this secur
ity. The active and excited demand for crude
copper in London this morning and apparen'lv
urgent bidding on the local Metal .Exchange
at advance* in quotations Indicated urgent re
qutrrmPTitt in the trade, but the advance In
Amalgamated Copper, while apparently a -logl
' cal result of these trade developments, is met
by . pcrsirtent rejiresentaions from sources
which the street regards as . authorized to
rpeak for" insiders, which seemed to be designed
to Â«liÂ«couraÂ«e the advance in the stock. These
representations are to the eSdet that the sup
ply of metal accumulated by the Amalgamated
Copper Company was not only sold at the low
Jevel. but heavy contracts for future delivery
are alleged to have been also made by that
company before the price cf the metal rallied
Speculative sentiment Is much confused by these

firm. But later selling orders developed and in

slowly sagged off. There was little of Im
portance In the news. Foreigners were; not in
the market to any extent. Shorts covered at
times on reports of bullish sentiment in the
Southwest and of poor shipments resulting from
the bad weather. When the market turned
quiet short sellers were encouraged and helped

. CHICAGO, Jan. 30. â A buoyant corn pit was
the dominant factor In the grain markets to
day. A strong cash situation has been grad
ually developing on the strength of the cold
weather and to-day stimulated speculation to
activity. Altogether this cereal was the
strongest and most active on the board. The
situation in the West and Southwest was the
principal factor. Kansas City reported a clear

the demand. Nebraska was not' offering I free

Mall advices from New York say: "In rai
eins spot quotations on California loose and
seeded are largely nominal pending the fixing
of a new basis by the syndicate. Efforts are
being made by a local interest affiliated with
the packers to purchase seeded on the spot, but
no < late business on this speculative Inquiry is
reported at the moment, buyer and seller being
apart. On jobbing account the movement is in
email lots around quotations.' The interest re
ported to have purchased from the association
a day or so ago is currently believed to be
working solely in the, Interests of the syndicate.
Valencia layer raisins are firmly held on the
quoted basis. In apricots the feeling is firmer
and a fair movement is noted. Peaches on the
epct are in some request and closely controlled
en the coast, total holdings there said not to
exceed 75 carloads. In prunes the spot market
lacks tone, due to small jobbing interest.
Strictly fancy new Santa Clara fruit is held
pretty firmly around quotations, but less desir
able quality offers lower. Coast advices note
a stronger feeling. In dates the market is
firm, with prospects favorable for a further ad
vence on Persian. Figs are in good jobbing re
quest and.show firmness on both bags and lay
ers."

NEW TORK, Jan. 30.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Mining continued to monopolize attention on
the â¢ Stock Exchange to-day and business in
that department was the most active since the
boom began. There were enormous purchases
by the Continent while New York was also a
buyer on a moderate scale. The general tone
continues to be hopeful. Consols touched
94%. The loan of the London County Council
was a success. The public, however. Is shy
of the West Australian loan. American stocks
were neglected until the afternoon, when they
stiffened on New York support. The favorite
Issue was Southern Pacific. Rio Tintos settled
at 45% on the risa in copper to Â£51% the ton.

throughout. The price touched 77 at one time,
which represented an entire recovery of-yes
terday's loss and % in addition. The net gain
on the day is 1%. Sugar was depressed and
at no time sold fully up to last night's level.
This morning's published report indicating lit
tle chance for the reduction of duties on Cuban
sugar affected the stock throughout. The pub
lication of the statement of the United States
Steel Corporation was ignored so far as could
be perceived in the dealings in the stocks of
that concern, which were of insignificant pro
portions. In the railroad list Southern Pacific
was In foremost place with a net advance of
2 points. The activity of this stock was as
sociated in the minds of the traders with the
resumption of active trading of a leading oper
ator after a period of illness. Its strength
helped the other transcontinental 'by sym
pathy. The increased net earnings for De
cember of Union Pacific, following yesterday's
Increases ,by other corn-carriers, was a help
to the Western and Southwestern grangers, as
the effectB of the corn crop shortage were ex
pected to develop not later than December. The
other movements of the day were from < indi
vidual causes. Evansvllle and Terre Haute
rose over 3 points on reports of a merger with
other North and South lines In Ohio and In
diana. The Linseed stocks advanced ! strongly
on reports of higher prices for Linseed Oil.
while the apparent cause for the strength of
the distilling stocks was a reduction in the
price of s-imits. Rock Island rose 3 points on
comparatively light dealings owing to the
small floating supply of the stock. The price
movement generally was very narrow, but
fractional net gains were the rule at the end
of the day. - .
The bond market became somewhat Irregu
lar. Total sales, par value, $3,065,000.
United States 5s coupon advanced % per cent

CANNED SALMONâ The Eastern demand la

WASHINGTON, Jan. . 30.â The hearings
on Chinese exclusion were continued to
day before the House Committee on For
eign Affairs. H. R: Fuller, in behalf of
the Brotherhood of Railway Employes,
spoke In favor, of â¢ strict exclusion. He
said the objection to the Chinese. from the
labor standpoint was that they come into
competition with American workmen, the
Chinese having such habits of cheap liv
ing that they work for .â¢ wages which re
spectable American, -workmen could not
afford to take. . . . .
Andrew Furuseth of the Seamen's Union,
San Francisco, gave the extent of Chinese
labor i on the Pacific Coast, . showing that
they- practically:' monopolized the , labor
field in the salmon canning industry: and
were competing with American Â¦ labor In
cigarmaking, tailoring, laboring and many
other branches. He said the Chinese
worker, in. these cases accepted wages so
much lower, than the .white men' that the
former secured the work. ;-,ââ¢â¢ . - ?

OAKLAND, Jan. t SO.â I. JC. Conklin
must answer in the Superior Court to
the charge of bigamy. He was bound
over to-day bv Justice Quinn, with bail
fixed at $2000.
Conklin has made a hard fight to evade
the charge made by Miss Elizabeth Gem
reich that he married her while he had
a wife living in the East. He secured his
release or dismissal three times, but was
as often rearrested on complaint of the
prosecution, which was awaiting the ar
rival of a copy of the certificate to ihe
Eastern marriage.
The admission of this copy in evidence
to-day enabled the prosecution to put the
Oakland dupe on the stand, it being im
possible to longer call her his wife. She
swore that she had been legally, as she
thought, wedded to Conklin, and swore to
receiving a letter. from the prisoner of
fering to square the case by getting a di
vorce from his first wife.

STOCKTON, Jan. 80.â About 9:30 to
night a. steady rain commenced falling
and up until a late hour it was coming
down in fair quantities. The atmosphere
is warmer and there are splendid indica
tions of quite a heavy storm. The grow
ing grain was greatly benefited by what
moisture it received up to midnight. ..
Local fruit companies "report -little or
no damage or inconvenience done their
business in California on account of the
cold of the last few days. The extremely
cold -weather in the East, however, has
caused considerable trouble to â¢ the ship
pers. On account of the zero weather in
Chicago and other places it has been im
possible in some cases to move fruit from
the cars, and sales have been interfered
with for this reason. Smail vegetables
were damaged considerably by the frost.
Reports received - at railroad headquar

night was 33 degrees above zero.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 80.â Reports from
McKittrick state that over an inch of
snow fell at that place yesterday morn

ruption for twenty-four hours. There are
no signs i of rain. ,
WOODLAND. Jan. 30.â The backbone
ot the cold wave has apparently' been
broken, the blast from the north has sub
sided and the wind is In the south. Now
that the temperature has risen the pre
vailing opinion is that there will : be
heavy rains early in February. Nobody
regards the cold wave as a calamity. It
has been, in fact, a distinct advantage to
orchards and vineyards. The effect has
been to prevent fruit and grape buds
from swelling too soon and to reduce. to
a minimum the danger from spring frosts.
Trees and vines will blossom two or three
weeks later than usual.
The minimum temperature for the last
twenty-four hours was attained just be
fore 5 o'clock this morning, when the
mercury was down to 36 degrees. While
this Is the official temperature as Â¦ regis
tered at the "Weather , Bureau, there are
places In Los Angeles in which . the mer
cury, went from 5 to 8 degrees lower.
There was a heavy frost this morning in
all low places in Los Angeles and vicin
ity. Ice formed in some places and soft
grounds in some cases were covered with
a crust of frozen dirt.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 30.â The. cold
weather continues in Los Angeles, but
with the warmth of to-day there promises
to be a break in the frigid wave so un
usual in Southern California and which
has been present for several days. Kill
ing: frosts have been predicted for sev
eral days heretofore and- these predictions
have, proved well founded. The outlook
now is for froBt; but of a? milder form
than that which has been seen every
morning in Los Angeles for almost a
week. The fruit crops are in no danger.

CROPS ESCAPE
RUIN BY FROST
Although O'Hallon was bleeding freely
from both his nose and mouth, the police
are loth to accept the idea that death
resulted from a loss of blood. They think
that he may iposslbly have met with foot
pads and had his skull fractured. The
name of the conductor who turned the
wounded man over to Officer McTierney
is not known, nor is it known where or
under what circumstances O'Hallon
boarded the Union-street car. Detective
Harry/Reynolds has been detailed to make
an investigation. ...â¢'Â¦.
After having taken a - drink O'Hallon
and Maloone boarded the Fillmore-street
car and rode to Geary street, where they
transferred to the Geary-street line.
When they reached Devisadero street
O'Hallon commenced to grow weaker, and
almost immediately upon reaching the
ground he collapsed utterly. He, died a
few minutes later on the, sidewalk.
/At the corner of Polk and Union streets

when he was bleeding profusely from the

John O'Hallon, who was a horseshoer
in the employ of the City Street Improve r
merit; Company, came to his death last
night- under such peculiar circumstances
that the police have undertaken - a Â¦ thor
ough investigation. It | is feared â¢ that

Judge Ogden to-day granted the En
quirer Publishing Company, G. B. Dan
iels and tiie other stockholders ten days'
time in which to plead.
He denies that he is= not In possession of
sufficient wealth to fully pay all his obliga
tions and in addition thereto such damage, it
any, as the plaintiff may have sustained by
reason of any act or omission on his part,
but on the contrary he alleges that he is en
tirely solvent and able to meet and satisfy
on demand any obligation for which he may
be liable.
Dr. Pardee" s attorneys are Mastick,
Van Fleet & Mastick.
Dr. Parde : declares that he has no in
formation ooncerning the charge that
Daniels is paid $500 a month salary, so he
denies that the wages are excessive. He
says he is informed that the Enquirer
has a contract for city printing, but he
does not know anything about the con
tract, so cannot answer the allegations
concerning an alleged combination.
Concerning his nnancial standing Dr.
\ardee says:
"He denies that any act done by ajiy of the
defendants herein with regard to said corpora
tion cr the management or business thereof was
done with his consent or connivance or by
h! s order or direction, or that he had any
cunsection therewith, direct or indirect.
This defendant denies that he has ever been
a. party to or has encaged in any fraudulent
scheme, combination or conspiracy with the de
fendants or either of them for any purpose
whatever or at all and denies that the busl
r.<"!!s of said corporation or the newspaper pub
lished by it has ever been conducted In his
interest or for his benefit or aggrandizement
or political advancement or for his personal
interest.
Denies Connivance.
Collins" allegation of fraud and con
spiracy on the part of Pardee, Dalton and
Daniels is met by the following denial:
accommodation and not otherwise this de
fendant and the said Dalton did indorse the
said note, but this defendant never did, at any
time. nor. as he is informed and believes, did
the defendant Dalton at any time receive any
portion of the consideration of said note or
any portion of said loan, nor was the said note
executed or #aid loan obtained in any wise
lor the benefit of this defendant, cither di
rectly or indirectly, nor. as he is Informed
and believes, for the benefit ot the defendant
Dalton.
Defendant denies that he either individually
or together with the defendant. Dalton. ever
Â«Jid borrow from the Central Bank of Oakland.
<ir from any corporation or person, the sum
at 555.000 mentioned in said complaint, or any
part therec!" or did cause any note to be ex
ecuted, either by himself or by any person or
persons except as is expressly admitted and
alleged in tlie answer. And in that behalf
thi? defendant allege* the fact to be that the
said defendant Daniels did. on his own be
half, borrow.- the said sum or $55,000 from the
said Centra! Bank of Oakland and did ex
ecute a no;e therefor to 6aid bank and at
the request of the said Daniels and for his
Dr. George C. Pardee. on behalf of him
self and Henry P. Dalton. has joined Is
sues with D. lidward Collins, president of
ihe California Bank.* who s=ued Pardee,
Dalmn. G. B. Daniels and the Enquirer
Publishing Company for an accounting,
making- charges of fraud in the manage
ment of the corporation. In a lengthy
answer to Collins' complaint, which was
illed to-day in the Superior Court, Dr.
Pardee makes specific and general denials
to many of Collins' allegations. The doc
tor denies at the outset that he owns or
controls any interest in the stock of the
Enquirer, or that any of its stock is held
in trust for his benefit. He likewise de
nies, upon information and belief, that
Dalton has any control of title to the
.stock whicli Collins asserts is held for
Dalton and Pardee by G. B. Daniels, the
manager of the Enquirer.
Pardee meets the charge that the di
rectors of the company are acting as the
tools of himself and Dalton with specific
denial.
Concerning the transaction at the Cen
tra! Bank over a loan of S55.OO0, which
Collins claims was made by Dalton and
Pardee to purchase the Enquirer. Dr.
Pardee's answer recites the following: .
Denies He Borrowed. \

Says He Was Hurt in Fall,

SOFTUXSS OF SEAXBKIN-.
2s Rivaled by Human Hair Where
Dandruff Is Eradicated.
Sealskin is admired the world over for
its softness and glossiness; and yet the
human hair is equally as soft and glossy
when healthy; and the radical cause of
all hair trouble is dandruff, which , is
: aused by a pestiferous parasite that saps
'.he vitality of the hair at its root. N'ew-
bro's Herpicide Is the only preparation
that is fatal to the dandruff germ. With-
out dandruff no falling hair, but a luxu-
riant growth of glossy, soft hair is cer-
tain. Scouring the scalp won't cure dan-
aruff. Kill the dandruff germ. Thou-
sands of women owe their beautiful suits
of hair to ICewbro's Herpicide.

HOTEL ARRIVALS.
Corporal of Marines Bylngton, who' Is In
charge of the office at Clay street wharf of
the Naval /Training Station tug Vigilant,
was attacked the other day by a number
of Apprentices from the United States
training ship Alert. There was just one
short round and no protests heard when
the corporal claimed 'the, decision on a
succession of knock-downs. . The Alert ap
prentices were on furlough." : . â¢ -
The training ship returned recently from,
a cruise with, sictaiess aboard. When she
was released from quarantine a number
of the boys were given furlough, but, on
account of having been exposed to sick
ness on their ship, were forbidden to visit
the training station, until the expiration
of their furlough. A few of them decided 1
Â¦to go anyhow, but were prevented from
boarding the Vigilant by Bylngton.
"Admiral's orders, boys, and, you can't
go aboard," said the corporal.
"We're going ' anyhow," replied the
yotmg-men-on-furlough, and in a body
they advanced to the gangway. The ma
rine blocked their way. ....
"Let's lick him," was suggested. Â¦ . - â¢
As the' Vigilant pulled away from the
wharf those on the tug. saw four dazed
apprentices sitting on the -dock gazing in
bewilderment, at the little corporal. . ! At
the end of their furlough about a dozen
of the Alert's company will be given to
understand that : when Admiral Glass says
"No"-that's what it means. a
Assaulted the Corporal.

.First, the convention extended its sym
pathy to the Pvev. Mr. W. J. Kip Jr. in
his continued suffering and, . acting
upon' the sugestion of Major Hooper, the
Bishop offered up a prayer for the recov
ey of the ailing clergyman. Then the Rev.
Mr. Foute moved and Rev, Mr. Sanford
seconded a resolution of sympathy with
the Rev. Dr. Spalding in hisÂ«indisposi
tion. The doctor had reported that he
had sufficiently recovered to undertake
light duties, and they felt -that a word of
greeting would be received by the rever
end' gentleman with much pleasure, be
sides giving him strength in his recovery.
The resolution was adopted with many
added expressions o'f sympathy. f
Major W. B. Hooper then presented a
recommendation from the finance com
mittee that the salary' of the secretary
of the convention be raised from $200 to
$300 a year. In submitting, the proposal to
the convention the speaker drew atten
tion to the invaluable work done by their
secretary, the Rev. Mr. M. T>. Wilson.
Bishop Nichols testified to the great, if
quiet, work achieved by Mr. Wilson. Only
those who 'were actually working in con-
Junction with the secretary, said he, had
the slightest idea of the arduous labors
No dry canonical rules were obtruded
to Interfere with; the deliberation which
brought out the good that is being done
daily by the clergy and laymen. â¢
Everyone present" at the convention at
St. John's Church was of Bishop Nichols*
opinion as to the very Interesting mat
ters that came up for consideration. It
was what might appropriately be. called
a humane meeting, for all the subjects
treated were of. charity, of brotherly feel
ing for the sick and infirm,, of suggestions
as how to best ameliorate the conditions
of the afflicted and the most feasible way
to reach the youths who have erred anu
who may be reclaimed.
THIS is one of the most interesting
meetings of the Diocesan Conven
tion," said Bishop Nichols yes
terday at the last session of the
year.
â¢ In speaking. to the resolution "Robinson
took the opportunity to say. that it was
time that the convention was put' on the
right side of. the subject which instigated
the resolution. ' It was opportune, that
they, expressed themselves on the matter
with. a view, of preventing in the. future
disturbances such as have taken place. >
Bishop. Nichols acknowledged the im
portance of the matter before th'em. All
felt, said V the Bishop, "that arbitration

double that amount, and more, who did
not- even do half thewdrk that is done
annually by their secretary. The'resolu
tion was carried unanimously. â¢.
V. J. Robinson -presented the following
resolution: .
Bishop. Nichols remarked that they had
much indeed to bethankful for when they
considered those- who were unselfishly giv
ing their time and, monev for the great
cause of charity. It showed a fidelity
and firm trust in God. There was a fine
record of high devotion at the back of
them, consequently there was an unusual
record in' our institutional life.
Thus the vigorous Diocesan Convention
of 1902 was .brought to a close. There was
a hymn, in which all joined, and a prayer
offered by the Bishop and the convention
adjourned s!m> die.
In the matter of the Armitage Orphan
age Major Hooper gave some statistics
and accounts that delighted the assem
bly.. told of the remarkable health
of the youngsters, and also suggested the
protective care which he deemed- espe
cially necessary when the boys grew up
to, be of age, when they came to the city
to earn a livelihood. â¢. He showed how the
philanthropic women who were interested
had separately taken upon themselves the

Church Close to Sufferers:
The Rev. Mr. Hitchcock said that It
was necessary to bring the church work
close to the â¢ sick and the dying in the
hospitals and presented the following res
olution, which was adopted: Â¦
secretary will draw up the letter' of sym
pathy. ,.
The Rev. Charles Hitchcock presented
n:s report from the committee on church
charities, which showed the great amount
of work accomplished by those interested
in .those important subjects. The com
mittee proposed that the Sunday nearest
St. Luke's day should be known as Hos
pital Sunday. He . strongly urged and
commended the suggestion. â¢
The report showed the energy with
which all the church work in con

struction of a park on the central strip of
Van Ness 'avenue, between Bush and

owners had been heard. The ordinance

pull up. . He continued going, however.
Chief Sullivan was unable to hold his

of obtaining money by false pretenses.
He said Hess had got $12 from him last
