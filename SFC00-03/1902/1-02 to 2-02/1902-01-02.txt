/^^ HICAGO, Jan. i. â One million dollars is i; the; sum offered by
I. Robert Lebaudy, a French multi-miHionaire, for theestablish-
inent of a French industrial school in' connection with the Uni
versity of Chicago. The tender was made to President Harper to-day
throtigh M. Lcbaudy's agent, Emile Ridel of the' French army. Dr. v
Harper promptly replied it was the wry thing . the university desired
and the preliminaries were settled at o|ce. The new school is to be an
integral part of the University of Chicago, and the necessary buildings,
for which M. Lebaudy will furnish the money, will be located on the
campus of that institution. M. Lebaudy does not expect to end his jn
terest in and support of the proposed school with the Rift of $i,ooo,
ooo. He also will establish an endowment fÂ«nd.
The institution takes on still z reater importance from the fact -that
it will be actively fostered by the French ' Government. - The students
will consist of 6oo Rraduates of French colleges, to be selected by the
Government, and 200 will be sent over each year. â¢ They! will come on
scholarships, all costs of transportation and living being defrayed , by
France. At the. conclusion of his conference with ! Dr. " Harper ' M. - Ridel
left for Washington to consult Embassador Cambon.

RAWLINS, "Wyo.^ Jan. 1â The body of
"W. M. Moody, a sheepherder who was lost
in the Red -Desert during the big storm
several- days ago, was found to-day,
frozen. stiff. Searching parties have hunt
ed everywhere for the herder's body, but
without , success until to-day, when they
were attracted to the spot where the dead
herder .lay by the. barking of dogs. The
dogs had remained with Moody during the
storm and were standing guard. over the
frozen' body.
Â¦ After the infantry and cavalry, came the
recruits, and In spite of -their "newness,"
they 1 , presented.' a': soldierly 1 '-' appearance.
The men of the Twenty-Bevehth came
down headed by theirband and:aJ5;they

There was really only one drunken man
oh the . vessel, and as ; it : afterward [ turned
out, "he, was not^ a member of the crew,
but; a visitor who had been celebrating
over night. Â¦ â¢ , .
The officers of the vessel thought the
crew, would also celebrate and it was ex
pected tbat some of them would '/turn up
missing." Instead of that every. man re
ported for duty on time and the vessel
went out with* a full and thoroughly com
petent crew.

that every. man of the levy was sober and

had hoped for is taken to mean' that the
Nicaragua Government in this protocol
has stated the price under which it is
willing to transfer to the United States
this territory and that this price is a
reasonable one. This Is good news for
the Nicaragua canal project, because it
has been reported that malign influences
hostile to this route had been at work in
Nicaragua endeavoring to have the pric3
marked up to an almost prohibitive figure.
Panama Route Too Cheap.
Representative Grosvenor of Ohio to
day declared himself in favor of the Nica
raguan canal bill. He said:
"These Panama fellows have fooled
around here a long time, and I don't be
lieve they should receive any more at
tention. They say they' have spent more
than 5100,000,000 on their canal,; but they
are willing to sell it for 540,000.000. Now,
if the canal is worth anything they
should not be willing to sell i at such a
discount, and since they . appraised It at
etch a email proportion of the cost price
the question arises whether it is worth
anything at alL" . " * * '
"I believe there, should be no delay and
that we should go ahead with the Nica
rs.guan canal. It Is reported to-day that
Colombia Is not willing to grant "this
country a permanent concession of the
Panama canal route. A long, lease is of
fered, but to many members of Congress
that is not acceptable."
Senator Morgan's statement that the
terms are much more favorable than he
negotiations between that country and
the United States providing for the fu
ture acquisition of territory through
â¢which to construct the Nicaraguan canal.
These negotiations, he said, have termin
fcted in a way much more satisfactory
than he had ever hoped for. He said he
could not give any details, because they
Â¦were communicated to him In such a way
fc* to bÂ» regarded In confidence.
Speaking of canal legislation, "Senator
Morgan said:
"The opposition to the Nicaraguan ca
,Â»al is opposition to any canal, and just
now it Is attracting considerable atten
tion in the newspapers. It will have no
effect upon the action of Congress. The
Hepburn bill will ' unquestionably be
passed by the House at a very early day.

etruction of fourteen of the fifteen car
riages of the disappearing, type.
Brigadier General Crosier, the chief of
ordnance, is, the new member of the forti
fications board and he will thus be -given
an opportunity to express his as to
the advisability" of* continuing the manu
facture of a type of gun carriage j wh^h
Lieutenant-General Miles and other mem
bers of the board declare to be obsolete. -
. It Is understood that this is not General
Crosier's Â¦ opinion. He \ believes that ?. the
Crosler-Buffington type now in use is the
best tha t v has yet been {produced, and it
will be his policy to recommend * its ; em
ployment until a better carriage - is ; in
vented. The board of ordnance and forti

question of the klpd of carriage that shall
be used for the coast defense, artillery.

PASADENA. Jan. L-With a perfect
day. an attendance that swelled the- local
population by 30,000 and a flower parade
that excelled all of the town's previous
attempts in that line. Pasadena to-day
witnessed " the greatest carnival In her
history. Every sort of vehicle, from the
bicycle to. the six-in-hand and the elab
orate floats, was dressed with such a
prodigal use of flowers and such ingenuity
of arrangement as almost to suggest a de
pletion in the supply of California's most
prolific product. ...
From every point . of -view the parade
was a success.^ As a spectacle It ha3 set
a high standard for future efforts and for
uniqueness of features it easily surpassed
all former carnival parados. Gaily capar
isoned caballeros, mounted on the versa
tile bronco, rode with reckless abandon
before the Chinese floats and the primi
tive - inhabitants -of- Sonthern-: California*
four and six in hands by the score, auto
mobiles and less imposing vehicles were
separated by. beautiful floats with scores
of beautiful women ,y garbed in white
equestrians, school- children, bicyclists'
with now and then a band of music all
combined to make up: a parade of much,
attractiveness and novelty.
Through two miles of Pasadena's fine3t
thoroughfares, packed with humanity be
tween rows of mansions, all showing the
carnival as' well . as the national colors,
the procession wended Its way to a point
at Orange Grove and California streets

after the parade was finished three steam
railroads and one electric ' line poured thÂ«
thousands into Pasadena. They fillea thR
streets, blocked traffic, overran the hote'a
and restaurants and stowed themselves
into every conceivable place to view tha
parade. The town was quite unprepared
to accommodate such a crush of visitors

gold-embroidered ; cape v and wide 'gold

pectationlwas on tiptoe as General. Miles
appeared ; before the President, but the
curious were not rewarded '.with anything
unusual. The President greeted General
Miles with the same hearty courtesy he
had Bhown'to others and General Miles
returned the salutation in the same spirit
and then- passed smiling along" the line,
exchanging well- wishes with the ladles.
Admiral Dewey was another of the dis
tinguished callers to engage ; the attention
of the crowds.. He was at the head of the
long line of naval officers, all in uniform
and including the ranking rear admirals
and he'ads of the naval staff departments.
The admiral wore the superb sword voted
to h!m by Congress for the victory ' of
Manila, -and on his breast was the. Con
gressional medal commemorating that
event. He, too, was most cordially wel
comed by the President. The officer's -of
the Marine Corps with Brigadier General
Heywood at their head followed the navy:

stream flowed past the President. At one
time there was a brief intermission to per
mit some of the ladies to: withdraw for
their private receptions. '.' The President
embraced this opportunity to limber up
his right hand, which began to show the
effects of continued handshaking.- > '

Presiaent took Mrs. Roosevelt on his arm
and amid the strains of a quickstep by
the marine band the: Presidential and
Cabinet party withdrew to - the private

TROUBLE BREWS
OVER ORDONANCE
President Roosevelt's manner . of re
ceiving his callers was exceedingly gra
cious and happy. As each guest was an
nounced by Colonel Bingham the Presi
dent grasped the hand of the visitor and
wished him a hearty New- Year, often ac
companying this with some 4 felicitous ex
pression to any one recogni2ed as a close
friend. There was no hurrying along of
the callers and often there was considera
ble delay while pleasantries were ex
changed. Mrs. Roosevelt proved' to be a
most charming New Year's' hostess . aritt
the cordiality of her greetings reminded
many of the callers of the days when
Mrs. Cleveland was mistress of the White
House. . ' * Â¦ - - , '. . '
After the members of the diplomatic
corps came Chief Justice Fuller and the
Associate Justices of the United/States

GO WAY BACK AND SIT DOWN!"
Exactly at 11 o'clock a fa.nfare from
three trumpeters stationed at the further
end of the main corridor announced the
approach of the President and the re
ceiving party. At the same moment
Presiaent and Mrs. Roosevelt appeared
at the uppfer landing of the corridor and
arm-in-arm descended the stairway whilft
the Marine Band broke into "Hail to the
Chief." The President bowed as he
passed along, frequently giving a cheery
response to the New Year's greetings ex
tended to him from those In the line.
Mrs. Roosevelt held in her hand a
6uperb bouquet of pink orchids. She wore
a gown of white satin heavily pleated
with lace yoke and diamond ornaments
and in her hair sparkled a diamond tiara.
The President was in the conventional
black frock coat. He had no boutonniere
and the gray striped neck scarf was the
only bit of color in his attire. Following
the President and his wife came the mem
bers of the Cabinet and their .wives, the
Secretary of State and Mrs. Hay. the
Secretary of the Navy and Miss Long:,

The Presidential party took up their
station in the. blue parlor with the Presi
dent snd Mrs. Roosevelt immediately
alongside the entrance, ready, to gxasp the
hands of callers as they were announced.
The Cabinet ladies formed a long line ex
tending from Mrs. Roosevelt to the
-further end of the room, while back of
the receiving line. were grouped the mem
bers of the Cabinet and a gay party, of
young people. As soon as the President
took his position he turned to the many
ladies invited behind . the line and pave
each of them in turn a warm, greeting
and the. well-wishes of the day. ' Then
the signal was 'Riven for admitting the
distinguished callers, who by this time
filled the outer corridors to o\-erflowlnsr.
As dean of the diplomatic corps the Brit
ish Embassador. Lord Pauncefote. is
usually the first of the foreign callers to
greet the President. To-day, however,
he was absent from the line, having con
veyed his preetlnes to the President, and
1he head of the line was taken by Lady
Pauncefote and the Misses Pauncefote
and the many military, naval and civil
members of the BritJ&h establishments,
all of t*e officers in full uniform. The

WASHINGTON. Jan. LâPresi
dent Roosevelt's first public
reception' was attended more
largely than any New Year's
reception " in a number of
years. In all 8100 persons filed through
the White House and shook hands with
the President. Roosevelt on being ap
prised that the crowd in line outside
the White' House was unusually largs
gave orders that the gates should not be
closed until the last person desiring to do
so had had an opportunity to pay his re
spects. The reception began promptly at
11 o'clock, and it was 2:30 o'clock before
the last person in line had been presented
to the President, and a quarter of ah hour
later before the reception came to an end.
The weather was delightful, being clear
and crisp, bo that no hardship was suf
fered by the throng that waited for hours
lor admission to the White House. The re
ception was in every way successful, the
attendance being not only very large but
the decorations beautiful, the arrange
ments perfect and the President in excel
lent spirits. Tel each person he extended
a cordial happy New Year, and Mrs.
Roosevelt was equally pleasing to each
of those who filed past the line in the
blue parlor, where the rest of .the receiv
ing party stood.- Miss Alice Roosevelt
was conspicuous among those' assisting at
the reception. A party of her young girl
friends, by invitation, also participated
in the 1'unetion.
Beautiful Floral Decorations.
The day was ideal for the observance
of the time-honored custom of making
New Year calls. The sun shone from y.
cloudless sky, the air was cool and brac
ing and a light southerly wind made tha
White House flag stand out proudiy.
Early in the day an army of decorators
and florists took possession of the man
sion and transformed the stately corridors
and parlors into bowers of palm, potted
plants and sweet-smelling flowers. The
official programme of the day fixed 11
o'clock as,the time for opening the recep
tion, with the calls of the members of the
Cabinet and the foreign representatives,
but some time before that hour the ap
proaches leading up to the marble portico
.were tilled with carriages, while long lines
of people took position at the outer gates
in order Â«to have points of vantage when
the public reception began.
The interior of the mansion was aglov/
with a myriad of electric lights, and t j
this was added the beauty or a profusion
of flowers, piants and vines banked about
the mantels and draped from chandeliers
and wails. The florai decorations reacheu
meir height of ettect in the east room,
iuere the great crystal chandeliers were
cteeorated witn emua-X, while the recesses
oi the. chamber were banked with bego
jiias and tali terns. In the red 'and b.ue
-parlors there was the same effective dis
position or flowers and plants, the flaming

Did you catch cold during the last' coi&^
spell? Â¦Â¦
Did It leave you with a cough or tick-
ling oi soreness in your throat, or a
slight discharge from the nose or ear or
ringing In the head?
If any of these things are true you are
in the first stages of chronic catarrh.
Peruna will cure you now in a very short
time.
If you wait until the catarrh -becomes
chroni.e It will take much longer to get
a permanent cure. Besides, no one is
safe a moment while chronic catarrh is
in the system.
It 5s capable of producing a multitude
of diseases, such as bronchitis, pneumo-
nia, quinsy, dyspepsia, Bright's disease
and many forms of female weakness.
This fact should lead every one who has
the slightest cold or cough to begin at
once the proper treatment.
Peruna Is the remedy for all this class
of diseases. It removes the disease by
removing the causeâ catarrhal inflamma-
tion or the mucous membrane.
If you do not derive prompt and satis-
factory results from the use of Peruna
write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a
full statement of your case, and he will
be pleased to give you his valuable ad-
vice gratis. - /

Gentlemenâ "After having used Peruna for a few weeks I find that it is a

. "I can recommend Peruna to be 'the
only genuine catarrh remedy that I have
ever tried. (I have tried a great many
during ; the five years that I have suf-
fered with catarrh.) Subject to colds as
I am from drafts and . sudden changes of
temperature, every new cold brought its
own fresh attack of catarrh. At times
mw nose was stopped up, and there was
a nois& like the rumbling of thunder in

"A friend advised me to take Peruna,
as it had cured him: I bought five bot-

my catarrh had disappeared.

of them yet, and whenever I get a fresh
cold I take a few; doses of Peruna as a
preventive from catarrh.

Gorman Sure of Senatorship.
ANNAPOLIS, Md., Jan. 1.â The General
Assembly of Maryland began its delibera
tions to-day, and after a brief session ad
journed for a week in order to allow time
to make up the committees. Xoble L.
Mitchell of Hartford County was elected
Speaker of the House and Senator John
Hubner of Baltimore County was re
elected President of the Senate. All of
the officers of the last session were re
elected in both houses. The fact that no
tices of contests for the seats of six Re
publicans in the House and one In tho
Senate were presented Indicates that the
Democrats desire a more comfortable
â¢working majority both on Joint ballot and
in the House than they now have, and as
the results In all the cases brought up to
day were very close it seems likely that
some changes will be made in the pres
ent make-up of the Assembly. The com
ing election of a United States Senator
created but little comment, as It Is al
most universally believed that Sen
ator Gorman will have no difficulty in
securing the prize when the balloting be

JCEW YORK. Jan. 1.â Seth Low, former
Mayor of Brooklyn and president of Co
lumbia University until he gave up that
office to become a candidate for, the
mayoralty on a fusion ticket, became
Mayor of New York to-day.
At tho same time there was an almost
complete turning over of city and county
offices by Democratic Incumbents to ' the
candidates elected on the fusion* ticket in
November. The changes in elected offices
Included the District Attorney, the Comp
troller, the presidents of the boroughs,
the Sheriff, the County Register and the
County Clerk. The successful ones were
&11 candidates on the fusion ticket except
the presidents of the Bronx and Queens
boroughs, where the Democrats were suc
cessful.
Of tho appointed officers the important
changes included the retirement of Police
Commissioner Michael C. Murphy, who
was succeeded by John N. Partridge, and
the appointment of George L. Rives t6 be
Corporation Counsel in . place of John
Whalen. Of the thirty-five district lead
ers of {Tammany Hall eighteen lost their
places 'in the public service to-day.
Low went to the City Hall about noon
and was received by Van Wyck; who
shook the new Mayor's hand and said:
"The time having arrived when my
term of office expires, I take great pleas
ure in turning it over to you, sir. You
came here by right of the people as
Mayor of the greatest city on earth. Let
me assure you that It Is my sincere de
sire that you may have a peaceable and
guccessful administration. I wish you a
happy New Year."
"I thank you sincerely for your kindly
greetings to me and for your kind words.
I speak for myself and for my. fellow
citizens, I am sure, when I wish you suc
cess," said Mayor Low in reply. :
} Low then took the oath of office, after
', -which he held a reception at the City
. Hall. When Deputy Commissioner of Po
lice Devery was introduced to his suc
cessor. Colonel Thurston, he asked the
new Commissioner. Colonel Partridge, to
assign him to duty as a member of the
uniform force cf the city. He claimed
that the act of the Legislature last winter
abolishing the office of Chief of Police
Â¦was illegal. Colonel Partridge said that
he would do nothing until the courts de
cided the question-
In an address to the captains Commis
sioner Partridge said that he believed
that the police department of New York,
which had freely been spoken of as "the
finest In the world," had fallen from Us
former high standard. He said he knew
that the duties of a policeman were many
and daring. Ee did not believe that the
most sanguine reformer expected to see
a perfectly orderly condition restored in
this city in a day, but he did believe that
the people expected 4mprGvement to fol
low improvement until there was a radi
cal char te for the better.
Colciu | Partridge said that the best way
to checl. the evils of gambling In various
forms was to strike at those piaces which
have In the most persistent manner defied
the law. The new Commissioner said
that the people expected greater vig
ilance in the protection of persons and
property and in the prevention of every
description of crime.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. l.-The chief
development in the legislative contest to
night was the announcement that Con
gressman Dick was on his way to Colum
| b,us to assist the Hanna forces. It had
; been. stated that General Dick desired to
keep entirely aloof from the present fac
tional contention on account of his guber-'
natorial aspirations. The leaders of both
the Foraker and the Hanna factions are
wl P hÂ£ C lp i mm s their ability to organize
both branches of the Legislature and the
indications are that neither side will ad
mit defeat before the holding of the party
caucus on Saturday night. Nearly all the
members of the Legislature will: have ar
rived In the city by to-morrow, night.
Ohio Factions Both. Confident.
The Governor recommends that the di
vorce laws be amended so that a decree
shall not be absolute until six months
after it is granted.
In directing. attention. to the excessive
and increasing cost of maintaining public
institutions Governor Odell seeks "to im
piess upon the Legislature that the time
has come to call a halt and to demon
strate that many of our charitable asy
lums are not run so much for the benefit
of the inmates as for the exposition of
j>eculJar and sentimental Ideas that
should have no part in the management
of our public institutions."
A change in the matter of commitment
of insane persons is recommended, so that
where relatives or friends are able to sup
port those harmlessly Insane they may
not become a burden on the State.
Amendment of the Penal Code Is recom
mended to the end that the, hearing: of
capital cases on appeal may not be de
layed so as to defeat the ends of justice.
In view of the fact that had President
SlcKinley survived the assault of Czol
gosz the latter could only have been sen
tenced to ten years' imprisonment, the
Governor recommends that on a charge of
assault with intent to kill a sentence of
twenty-five years be imposed.
Many Amendments Heeded.
The second proposition is that the canal
be deepened to a uniform depth of nine
feet. The cost of carrying out the latter
project would be J15.056.167. The Governor
also recommends that no railway com
pany be permitted to cross canal bridges
unless an agreement is made to strength
en and keep in repair the structure.
Concerning the canal situation the Gov
ernor recommends that ' two â¢ propositions
be submitted to the people. The first of
these Is that tlje locks be enlarged to a
1000-ton barge capacity and the construc
tion of a nine-foot channel from the Hud
son River to Redford flats.
The Governor expresses his approval of
the proposition to make the tax upon
mortgages on realty 5 mills, which would
produce an annual revenue of $3,003,0.0
and increase the revenues from indirect
taxation to an amount almost equal to
the annual requirements of the State. In
order to remedy the evasion of tax laws
by corporations the Governor suggests
that local assessors be given authority to
compel corporations to furnish lists of
stockholdings..
The excessive cost of receiverships of
public or semi-public institutions Is given
attention in the message, the evils of the
present system being illustrated by the
fact that the total expenses involved in
the liquidation of the affairs of seventy
corporations during the past ten years
have been 51,606,223. The Governor there
fore recommends "the amendment of the
banking and insurance laws so as to pro
vide that all proceedings affecting insur
ance and banking corporations under the
control of the State banking and insur
ance departments shall not only be insti
tuted by euch departments, respectively,
but that they Ehall be placed absolutely
under their control during the liquida
tion."
Receivership Law Defective.
If open saloons should be authorized in cos
mopolitan cities, demands would soon follow
for licenses from other branches of business
and might reach an extent that would arouse
the consciences of every man and every woman
In our . commonwealth who believe not only in
a day of rest, but In rendering to God who
has blessed us as a nation the homage that Is
due to him.
But if by local option is meant the right to
determine whether the doors of the saloons may
legally remain open on Sundays, then a differ
ent proposition is presented and a departure is
proposed from the fixed rules which have gov
erned the administration of the excise laws,
and it then becomes a question which con
cerns not only a particular city, but every
section of our State. Each locality owes to
all others a due regard for- their rights and
convictions and their moral and physical com
fort. No such departure should, therefore be
sanctioned nor power delegated to localities
touching, as this would, upon the fundamental
principles which have had their growth from
the foundation of our country, unless clearly
desired by a majority of the people of the
State. Before submitting a referendum to
the cities the whole question should be passed
upon by the people.
Local option as it relates to the liquor traffic
is understood as meaning that in all communi
ties other than cities tne inhabitants thereof
eh&ll have the right to determine whether
liquor shall be eold in such communities six
days of the week and upon the determination
of that Question the excise department predi
cates its administration. This right was given
because boiore the enactment ot the present
excise law it was within the power of the
voters or of the appointing authorities in the
municipalities and villages to absolutely pro
hibit tne sale of liquor by electing or . ap
pointing a board opposed to the granting of
such license. It is a well-known fact that in
the original draft of the State constitution the
same rights as to the local option were sought
to be given the municipalities and that tney
do not possess them is aue to the opposition
of their own representatives. There can be
no objection to submitting this same question
to the voters of the cities if it is bo desired, as
it would be treating all parts of the State
alike.
Control of Liquor Traffic.
Discussing the correlated subjects of
sumptuary legislation And local option,
the Governor says in part:
"In looking over the salary list of the
city of New York," he says, "it will be
found that there are several officials who
receive a larger salary than the Governor
of the State or the Cabinet officers of the
United States, and it cannot be claimed
With any degree of truth that the serv
ices renderea are always commensurate
with the compensation given."
The Governor also suggests that there
should be a safe margin to enable each
local legislative body to absolutely iix
and determine the percentage of income
to be expended for salaries.
The Legislature is - recommended to
frame a law which will give : the State
Board of Tax Commissioners greater
power to enforce the . rule against ex
cessive as well as low assessments and
to make the State Board a Previewing
court to investigate and correct inequali
ties in the matter of assessments and
thus become not only a mediator as be
tween counties of the State, but also to
serve to protect the rights of individuals
in each locality.
Governor Odell devotes a considerable
space to a discussion particularly appli
cable to New York City. Tne Governor
observes that "the almost total abolition
of State taxes will bring home to tha tax
payer the fact that his expendi'urcs are
to be peculiarly local,' and if they, are ex
cessive the remedy Tests wuti'him to re
buke those who are charged with the ad
ministration of his local uii:m\j."' . .

partmental work of the California Teach

cussed along the line as to whether the

an education or. rfcerely preparatory. This
question and the present accrediting sys
tem by which hign school pupils are'ad
mitted ' to r the university are being largely
talked of in educational circles at present
and "some of the "strongest men of the
coast were heard this morning. The con
sensus of opinion was that the high
school's function should not be only pre
paratory-

obliging the stuaeut to cnoose a conege

present system by : which ' Latin is made

that Latin had usurped an importance
that' was {largely due . to tradition and
crowded out better educational matter.
" The speakers commended . tne accredit
ing Â¦ system in - the main, though several
pronounced it faulty in some particulars.

in Its general public effect than anything

TACOMA, Jan. 1.â Puget Sound lumber
men will receive $15 per carload more for
fir flooring, ceiling and finishing- lumber
and cedar siding during 1892 than they did
last year. These grades constitute the
largest part of lumber shipments to East
ern Â¦ points. The increase has been an
nounced by the executive committee of the
Pacific Coast Lumber Manufacturers' As
sociation and consists of $1 per 1000 feet on
the grades of lumber, mentioned. The
price on rough and dimension 'fir lumber
will remain as it was last year. Some
other minor 'changes, are made : in the
scale. : :s â . - â¢ " >Â¦â¢ â¢
Next week a circular will be issued, giv
ing the changes In detail. The cost of pro
duction: has increased during 1 the past
year, prices on fir logs being higher
everywhere. These facts constitute the
basis for the increased price of the - fin
ished product. The Eastern demand â¢ for
lumber was never better, making it cer
tain that the sales will not be curtailed
by the increased rates. Â¦ - : . â¢
Among the largest beneficiaries by the
higher schedule will be the lumber com
panies of San Francisco," which own some
of the largest Sound mills, such as those
at Port' Ludlow, Port Gamble and Port

the law firm of Evarts, Choate & Bea
man, Joseph H. Choate has withdrawn
and temporarily at least will discontinue
the practice of law. Choate communi
cated his Intention to his associates some
time ago, giving, as his reason that his
duties of state as Embassador from the
United States to England have prevented
his active participation in the affairs of
the partnership for the last two years
and that these duties would consume so
much of his time .for several years to
come that it would be impossible for. him
to pursue his law practice. Another rea
son was that the recent deaths of Wil
liam M. Evarts, Charles C. Beaman and
Prescott Hall Butler would necessitate a
change in the firm name, and he urged
that such ehould be done.

plan by which the Westinghouse Com

are to be merged with a capitalization of
$50,000,000 has no foundation so far as he
is aware. He adds:.
"Such reports are easily originated and
readily believed, as the majority of finan
cial people and others interested in indus
trial matters lock upon such an arrange
ment as almost Inevitable. The chief ob
stacles In the way of such .an arrange
ment are probably the conservative views
of those In control of the Westinghouse
Company as to the capitalization, man

FAST RIDE
WITH HOUNDS
Eugene Geary's fast courser, Bonnla
Pasha, sister of the champion greyhound
Palo Alto, won first honors in the Holiday
stake yesterday at Union Coursing Park,
Hugh Lynch' s speedy youngster. Merri
mac, was the runner-up. In the long odds
book Merrimae was a strong: choice and
in the final was quoted a 2 to 7 favorite
over Geary's greyhound. Bonnie Pasha
drew out well for the turn after a long
j run up and held possession . until the
course was finished, , without allowing the
younger dog to score. The hares, while
not as speedy as recent lots, were fast
enough to make the trials interesting.
Loyal Lad reached third place in the
stake by clever work. He beat St. Ives
and Real Article at short end prices and
looked a strong factor for stake honors.
He finally succumbed to the runner-up.
Amedee, too, was favored for the final,
but lost the flag to Bonnie Pasha in the
fourth round in a close course.
Jingle Bells furnished the upset at t hÂ»
day. In the run down Vulcan, her op
ponent, was the choice at 1 to 5. Jingle
Bells showed the speed and scored the
turn and Vulcan, plcKing up the hare, shut
himself out without scoring- enough points
to overcome his opponent's lead.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Jan. l._
The 6tufiy report cards for the past eem
ester, which have Just been Issued by the
registrar, show a. very marked improve
ment over those issued last year at this
time. As near as can be learned only
twenty men were dropped for deficiencies
in thoir work, and of these only two were
prominent In athletics. Last year at this
time about fifty men were dropped in
cluding the football captain, four varsity
men, the student body treasurer, the
irack manager, the football manager, th*
editor and the manager of the Daily Palo
AHo and several athletes.
â¢ The cause cf this remarkably clean rec
ord is not clear. Probably the short foot
ball prason this year had much to do with
the pood standing of the football men.
The work in every department has been
raiFert to a hls'ier standard than it hiis
ever been in the history of t*Â»e university.

One * of the dread Reaper's first de

the most sorrowful, : was recorded yester
day in the death of Miss Mollle Taylor, a

she was operated upon for appendicitis
She lingered until yesterday, when she
died.- --
Miss ,Taylor had devoted her life to the
study of the piano and had acquired a
brilliant technique, although she was only
16 years old. She had set a date ln the
latter part of February for her public ap
pearance, ln San Francisco and the ar
rangements for her concert were? well un

Spectators at Pasadena Game Witness the
Most Superb Teamwork Ever Shown on
a Gridiron in the State of California
most spectacular exhibition of football j
over seen in California. Briefly, the Stan- I
ford eleven were outplayed,' outgeneraled,"
outrun, outklcked , and apparently out
of -condition. â¢ The cardinal team-In the
first part of. the first-, half made one
heroic defense of their goal line, thrice
hurling back the ' entire Ann Arbor, team
when it had only a yard to gain, securing
the ball on downs and kicking to mldfleld.
That gallant stand proved the excellence
of . Palo Alto's raw material, and the
thousands of spectatorsâ the rooters â¢ on
the stands, the daintily gowned -women
and well-groomed . men on tallyhos . hid
den in rosesâ cheered the cardinal with
that riotous abandon, of undergraduates.
Then began the fierce* onslaughts of the
Easterners, who tore great rents in the
cardinal line, scored a touchdown, fol
lowed it up with a field goal, and closed
the first half with another goal, with the
score 17 to 0. It â¢ was * then . evident, Â¦ even
to Ho Wing Sin, the secretary of the Chi
nese Consulate in San Francisco, who
came down to see â¢ the ; game, that . this
siege of pigskin .was, destined to be one
sided.
The second half proved . the' fiesta field,
bathed ln warm sunshine and strewn with
flowers, to be a veritable gridiron for
Stanford, upon which their football pres
tige frizzled away. ,
The Ann Arbor-backs, with relentless
fury# dashed against the -Stanford -line,
over it, through it and ground it to pieces.
Michigan could have pushed the cardinal
line into the sea â¢ at Santa Monica. ; The
Stanford backs were not nearl enough to
Michigan's long , punts to catch them
with a pitchfork; It became a ; procession
up and down the field. The timekeepers
were merciful and called the game on ac
count of darkness, with seven minutes re
maining of the . thirty-five minute half.

round Jackson sent the Newark man to
the platform with a crash. He struggled
to his feet, but Jackson smashed him all
over the ring. A left inside hook to the
3aw sent Handler to the ropes, which
saved him from going down again. He
was groping helplessly around the ring

ST. LOUIS. Mo., Jan. 1.â Joe Bernstein
of New York was awarded the decision
over Tommy White of Chicago to-day at
the end of fifteen rounds before the West
Knd Club. The decision, in the opinion
of many, was an injustice to the Chicago
l>oxer. White landed repeatedly with left
jabs throughout the fight.
In the early rounds Bernstein attempted
to rush, but left counters, beautifully
timed, stopped him. In every round White
landed repeatedly with his left on Bern
stein's face. Bernstein would rally near
the end of each round and for about thirty
seconds would rush and rough matters,
doine. however, little or no damage to
White. The men fought at 126 pounds.

to-day defeated Stanford Univer-
Michigan's Steady Gains.
sity. The score is quite in pro
portion to the general superiority of
Eastern men at the game of football. It
c'.oes not, however, tell the gtory of Stan
ford's desperate but futile efforts against
defeat. Michigan's superior knowledge
of the game showed in every play. At
kicking, general team work, running,
tackling and bucking the line the Mich
igan men excelled. Perhaps the strong
est feature of their playing, was the phe
nomenal puntlnc: by Sweeley, Michigan's
right end. In every exchange of punts
Stanford lost ground which she ' could
not regain. -
In the first half Stanford showed well
for the first twenty minutes, forcing
Michigan's line for small gains and hold-
Ing her opponents when they went against
her line. Gradually the Michigan boys
forced the ball -down the field for steady
gains through center and around the left
end. By a series of brilliant plays that
never failed to score a gain and by the
most superb team, work ever shown on
a football field in California, Michigan
took the ball to Stanford's three-yard line.
Here the Calif ornians took a determined
stand, and, encouraged by the shouts of
their partisans,, withstood the terrible
battering of their line until they secured
the ball on downs.
Then began a systematic- and deter
mined assault " on Michigan's invulner
able line. Stanford tried every . trick
known to her men to advance, . only to
resort to punting, and the consequence
was loss of ground. Again Mlcnlgan
hammered the line for steady gains:
Clark, Stanford's left end, was disabled
Sn a fierce scrimmage and was replaced
by Preston. Michigan's star fullback,
Snow, scored the first touchdown and
biÂ«orta kicked goal. Score: Michigan, 6;
Stanford, 0. '' â¢ '
Three times ln the first half Michigan
succeeded in sending a man over the
line, but once she failed to add a goal.
The first half ended with the score:
Michigan, 17; Stanford, 0. â¢
The second half was an exhibition of
fast football, such as California had
never before witnessed. Michigan went
at her opponents with all the knowledge
of the game and the weight of her play
ers. They .hit Stanford's line in the mld-
Cle and they went around the ends. They
advanced ten, fifteen and twenty Â¦ yards
on a play, on fake passes, fake kicks and
every other known football device. In
fact, so fast and fierce was their play
that Stanford was bewildered and knew
not how to stop the encroachment on her
goal.
Once or twice again- the Calif ornians
held the conquerors for . downs, but the
arrested progress of the Ann Arbor: men
was extremely brief. Again and : again
Snow for Michigan went over the line
for touchdowns , and Shorts kicked goal
until forty-nine points had v been scored.
For Michigan the brightest star was
Snow at fullback, though â¢ he scarcely,
eclipsed Sweeley and Bernstein. . Traeger,
for Stanford, played a brilliant game, his
tackling being one of the features. - '
The day was perfect, even for Southern
California, though possibly. a trifle warm
for football. The field upon which ; the
team met was as level as a floor, . but
very dusty. The crowd, the largest that
ever attended an athletic event in South
ern California, numbered about 7000 and
presented all the, animation and. much
more of color, than ' the average football
crowd. HKtMPiHinMM

Michigan advanced the ball twenty- three

Thomas D. Riordan Is About Beady
to Name Eighteen Members
at Large.
The late convention at B'nal B'rith Hall,
which nominated Asa R. Wells for Mayor
and Arthur G.nsk for District Attorney,
authorized each delegation to select four
members of a county committee. The
power of appointing eighteen committee
men at large was delegated to Thomas Â£>.
Rlordan. chairman of the convention. Mr.
Riordan will probably. name the eighteen
to-day or to-morrow. The committee of
ninety thus established will soon meet
and organize by the election of a chair
man. It may attempt to direct opera
tions ln the local political field as the
governing body of the Republican party,
but Its initial Influence will be used to
obtain patronage at the City Hall for
commltteemen and their friends. There
are several candidates for the chairman
ship of the "governing body" of the par
ty, and among the aspiring are Thomas
D. Rlordan and A. G. FIsk. â¢
At the time the convention selected
seventy-two commltteemen and empow
ered the chairman to name the eighteen
at large the Impression existed that the
primary election law would be knocked
out by the Supreme Court and that the
"governing body" of the party would
conduct the business of electing or ap
pointing delegates from San Francisco to
the Republican State Convention. It now
appears tha t the boss politicians, -who
were ready to assail the primary law in
the courts, have changed front. The vot
ers, who want to have a voice in the
election of delegates to nominate State of
ficers, are -well satisfied with the law.
Lawyers â¢ of recognized ability . pronounce
the act constitutional. The bosses, taking
the hint, are no longer threatening to up
set the law.
The County Committee cannot cut much
of a figure in the State campaign unless
the act regulating primary elections is
overthrown by. the Supreme Court, hence
there are indications that this particular
"governing body" will devote Its main
energies to the task of getting jobs.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
Such a report is "important if true." Telegraph
companies no -longer have a monopoly. The long
distance telephone* is already competing with them
and wireless telegraphy is impending. It is quite
probable, therefore, that a plan is under way to en
able the astute managers of the telegraphs to sell ouC
The reports concerning it are as yet, nothing, more
than rumors, but. the bills now before Congress for
the purchase of the. telegraphs will bear watching.
Upon that showing the Springfield Republican
connects Postmaster General Payne with the scheme
by saying: '"Mr. Payne is commonly regarded as a
corporation man through and through and yet it is
understood at Washington, says a report from tha"t
city, that he favors Government ownership of tele-,
graphs, that the administration's purpose is to carry
out the project, that Payne has. an ambition to. do
so, and that all the Democratic members of Congress
and many Republican members will favor it."
consideration for some months. Prominent people
arc interested and while no predictions are made as
to the outcome the subject is certain to come before
Congress.", . . . â¢ -
Several bills have been already introduced into
Congress providing for the purchase by the Govern-'
ment of the telegraph systems of the country and
their operation in connection with the postal service.
Had only one bill to that effect been presented, per
haps little attention would have been paid to it, but
the introduction of 1 number of such measures has
aroused suspicion that there is something big be
hind^it, and accordingly, the theorists who have been
searching for an explanation of the appointment of
Mr. Payne have jumped to the conclusion that he is
backing the proposition. /
. The plan of combining the telegraph system with
the postal system is not new. It has been under dis
cussion a long time, has bepn supported by a con-,
siderable class of people and was recommended by
Mr. Wanamaker when holding the office of Post
master General. This time, however, it comes in a
new form. It is asserted that the owners of. the tele
graph systems of the country wish to sell out to the
Government and a recent advance in Western Union
in Wall street was attributed by a New York paper
to a report from Washington of a. plan for the pur
chase of Western Union and Postal Tclegraph^stock
_by the issue of 2 per cent Government bonds. It
was. added: "A plan of this kind has. been" under
First it was asserted with much emphasis that the,
Appointment meant the beginning of an active cam
paign on the part of the President to procure a rc
nominatiou. That theory grew out of the fact that
Mr. Payne is an active and experienced campaigner
and political manager as well as a good business
man. As it is well known, however, that the renom
ination of the President is as well assured as any
human event can be, the theory did not find much
favor. Other theories that followed immediately
after the appointment were not much better. Now,
however, comes one that has the merit of advancing
a notable scheme for the establishment of a postal
telegraph system, and, accordingly, whether true or
r.ot, it is interesting.
EVER since the announcement was made of the
appointment of Henry C. Payne to the posi
tion of Postmaster General there has been a
keen effort on the part of the Eastern public to dis
cover the "significance" of it. A good many people
seem unwilling to beiieve that the. President aimed
at no more than getting a competent man to take
charge of the postal affairs of the country and w-ork
in harmony with the administration. They are con
vinced that there was an ulterior motive for the. ap
pointment and. many are the theories advanced to
explain it.
POSTAL TELEGRAPH REPORTS.
r Â¦ V HE Â¦ officials connected ' with the underground rapid
1 I ":' transit, road in New York, wKo recently returned from
I /-Europe, after, an inspection of the underground roads of
,'*-;'Â¦Â¦Â¦ the Old World, reported that Germany was one of the
.most progressive countries visited, and that conditions
more nearly akin to Yankee skill and inventiveness in matters
electrical obtained in Berlin than anywhere else.
By Siemens & Halske, the well known electricians, has re
cently been constructed an electric ' locomotive which mechan
ical experts say. will revolutionize the existing methods of loco
motion. The Germans under the order of Emperor William
Recently made several .trial trips with this invention, and these
tests proved in : every way satisfactory. The "War Minister
has placed at the disposal of the experimenting company the
military line between Berlin and Zossen, and the cars have
on occasion sped ovjr this route^ at the rate of 123 miles an
hour. r . \
* These "flyers" take the electrical current from three wires.
The electrical engine is a queer-looking affair, being heavy at
the base, with two boxlike arrangements for the machinery
extending back and front of the glass-inclosed C ab, which
projects upward about four feet. Across the top of this cab
â¢ extend the three sliding contacts, fastened on an iron girder,
which is regulated by a rope somewhat on the same plan as
a trolley pole, except that these contacts are raised or lowered
from the front Instead of from the rear of the car.. The loco
motives carry their . own â¢ motors, not only one, . but four of
them, all heavily charged and all in use at the one time.
The line between Berlin and Zossen extends through ah
open country. There is little or no traffic over this route, and
I the cars can speed along unimpeded by wagons, street cross-
Ings or pedestrians. If the invention is adopted by the trac
tion and railroad companies of Germany most of the lines will
have to be altered; their present course through the business
section will have to be done away with and the lines run along
the outskirts of the town. Cross tracks will be avoided as
much as possible, and where it is necessary to rurf^througn,
built-up localities elevated roads will be used.

effective Â¦ system of fog signals by means of sound.
While it did not make any experiments with other
methods of signaling, the committee refers to the
possibility of employing electric signaling, and 'de
clares that if such a method could be made practical
it would afford a : great^ advantage ".by Â¦.Â¦reason of- its'
freedom from variability, and ( its independence of at
mospheric conditions. In conclusion, the report says
that! sound signals ' in fogs must be regarded as only
auxiliaries to navigation which' cannot be at all times
Another remarkable phenomenon noted during the
trials was the length and strength of the echoes from,
seaward, breaking in upon -the sounds from â¢ the sta-.
tion^and- sometimes lasting much longer than the
original sounds. The echoes were mostly noted from
land stations and at a , comparatively . little Â¦ distance
from the instruments, but they were also heardat
times from-the- vessel; engaged in the experiments.
They, were heard only when the sea was calm and
the air Â¦ tranquil, 'and* were attributed ; to "the reflec
tion of sound-waves from invisible acoustic clouds,"
formed by air currents differently heated or differ
ently saturated with vapor. Â¦ The echoes of course
may' possibly; at; times be mistaken for the :. signals
themselves: and are. therefore another source of dan
ger, in any system of signaling by sound.
;. Such. are some of the obstacles in the way of an
The phenomenon' was noted only in calm weather
with a still sea. The scientist to whom the subject
was referred attributed the occurrence to the sound
waves striking the smooth surface of the near water,
and, being . reflected upward, the reflected waves in
terfering for 'a. certain distance with. the direct waves
emanating from the', sound producer. The commit-,
.tee points out /that this liability of interruption of
sound at short distances should be carefully impressed
upon seamen, s*o that their failure to hear fog signals
may not lead them to believe they are , far from
points of "danger. .
able distance farther.
Among the curicus phenomena experienced' during,
the 'tests was the existence of a. soundless zone be
tween areas, where sounds were clearly heard.' Up to
the distance of a mile sounds would be clearly . dis
tinguished, then they would sink to extreme faint
ness and become almost inaudible, but . at a farther
distance would increase, in force, and at about three
miles the sounds would be recovered and froni that
point would be carried h\ full hearing for a consider-.
D: URINGthe past summer the British Govern
ment carried out an extensive series of , ex
periments for the purpose of discovering the.
best means of signaling through fogs. It appears,
the trials were made wholly. with signals by sound,';
as no other means yet k known is anything like so ef
fective for the purpose as sound ; waves produced by.
proper apparatus. The conclusions /, do not assure
any adequate meansof signaling through thick' fogs,
but the experiments brought : to light a good many
curious phenomena which will' b'eV found f interesting
not only by seamen .but by the. general public as

One of the main, objects of thV experiments- was to
determine the relative efficiency^ and , carrying' power
of tones of aNhigh or ..a -low ' : pitch, and to "ascertain,
the air pressure at.whichthe siren yields the best re
sults. It is stated that under favorable conditions a
new form of disk siren giving a. very low tone, ninety
eight vibrations'- to the. second, outdistanced every
other instrument tested.. The sound carried as a
"good sound" for a distance of something more than
twenty miles and could be heard farther by persons
giving close attention. Instruments having a sound
of higher pitch were heard at a less distance, some
of them not more than ten miles. It was noted,
however, that when, the weather ;:';\yas rough and
stormy the high tones carried : farther than the . low
t6nes, and the report of the committee says! "For
calm weather a low pitched note is more suitable than
a high pitched one, but when the wind is opposed to
the course of the sound waves, or the sea is rough
and "noisy,- a", high pitched . note penetrates farther
than a low pitched; one."- ; , ;Â¦-...â¢' .....

Those statements made by Major Owen in a paper
read before the Cincinnati Medical Academy and re
printed from, the Journal of the American Medical
Association of October 26, 1901, show,*what sort of
water has been used in the public water supply of
the city. Can any further argument be required to
prove the need of undertaking the first steps toward
getting a better supply? ' . ~- ._
Continuing "his review of the subject Major Owens
went on to say: "I believe the analysis of Price. &
Son was correct when made; that the differences
which" exist between us are due to changes which
have taken place from the increased number of bod
ies in the watershed, from the increase of population
within the watershed; that with these two causes the
sand is more soiled and therefore no longer filters
bo well as formerly. It is a well-known fact that
when sand is well aerated and not overloaded it
will filter out from 98 to 99.5 per cent of all germinal
matter present." Then he adds: "Point Lobos
Creek is the natural drainage channel of this water
shed. I was informed in the office of the Spring
Valley Water Company that it had been formerly in
use as a water supply for the city of San Francisco,
but that it had been abandoned for such use as it
was too polluted."
WHEN it was first proposed that [ground
should be . purchased for the purpose of
establishing a large park in San Francisco
many . citizens ': opposed it. ' They argued that 'there
was no. immediate need of -a' park, that the city would
never require so large a -park as^that proposed, and
that if- we were ever to have a park at all it w6uld : be
better, to wait until, the need became .urgent. Had
that counsel been < followed San Francisco, instead of
now enjoying one, of the finest parks in the world
would be debating how to get one. There would
Hlso be a debate how to pay for it. What would it
tost San Francisco to-day to purchase the ground
now occupied by Golden Gate Park? ' /-.
The story of; the PÂ«rk is pertinent to the water
question.. There are people who object to concern
ing themselves with the issue of a better and. more"
abundant water supply, because, as they say, the need .
is' not urgent, that the present supply will be... suffi
cient for a long time in the future, that it would be
better to", wait until the need becomes urgent before we
act. In short, they say about the water problem just
what similar-minded citizens said about the original
park proposition, and it is 'therefore important to
remind the public that every year of waiting will in- :
crease the eventual cost of the supply that will be
ultimately needed. ' It is the; park ; problem over
again. A- water â¢ supply from the mountains could
be provided now. for much less than it will be, possi
ble to obtain it ten 5r twenty years from now.
That th; present Sources of supply are hardly ade
quate for present needs is proven by the fact that the
water company made use of Point Lobos Creek as
a source of supply until forced to desist by the .city
authorities. : The unfitness of that. water for human
use has been set forth in a pamphlet by Major W.
O. Owens, M. D., on "Preventable Diseasef in the
Army of the United Statesâ Case, Effect and Rem
edy."- In describing conditions of water supply at
various camps Major Owens says:
"Take the report of Lieutenant Colonel A.S;*Kim
ball, Quartermaster's Department, on the water sup
ply of the Presidio, California. (See Report Sur
geon General of the United States Army to the. Sec
retary of War, 1896, pp. 137-38.) His report shows
a water of undoubted high quality. He has based his
report on the analysis made by Thomas Price, &
Son. It is evident that these chemists were not in
formed as to the character of the watershed from
which this water is obtained. Mountain Lake, from,
borings around which this water is obtained, has a
watershed of, two and one-half to three square miles;
it is composed of seashore sand resting on a bed of
rock. In this watershed are three of the largest
cemeteries of the city of San Francisco. A very large
part of this watershed is a closely built city with
sewered streets, which sewers have ' uncemented
brick bottoms. There are many animals stabled in
it; all of the fecal mntttr of these animals and of this
population is stored in this watershed; all of. the
products of the decomposition of the bodies buried
in these three graveyards drain into -.it; all of the ex
crement and kitchen waste of old Cam? Merritt were
buried in it. (There were some 18,000 men camped
in this camp.) So long as the sand retains" its ability
to filter properly the water will be safe. When it be-"
comes saturated with filth the 'health of the soldier
at the Presidio will suffer. The water level of this
,lake has b6en * lowered some twenty feet since the
pumps have been at work. The officers' of .the Ma
rine Hospital Service tell me they are afraid to use
this lake water without first subjecting if to sixty
pounds of steam. I made a careful chemical anal
ysis of this water in 1899 and a careful personal in
spection of this watershed; it was self-evident 'there
must be contamination from animal sources." :

evening, December 10, the following
named gentlemen were elected vestry
men for the ensuing ecclesiastical year:
Rev. Herbert Parrish, president; A. J.
Hasten, senior warden; John Dempsey.

A FLEET of new four-masted
schooners will be added to the
coast service during the month.
A dozen of them are now near
ing completion, and inside of a
week the first of them v:ill be. launched at
Everett, Wash. She has been built for
San Francisco parties, and Captajn John
Pedersen will be the managing owner."
The new schooner is to be named the
John H. Lunsman, and will be 230 feet
over all, 40 feet 10 Inches ream and 16 feet
deep. She is a sister ship to the W. F.
Garms, and will carry 1,400,000 feet of
lumber. Judging from reports the Luns
man will not only be a great carrier, but
an able sea boat. â¢ " ,
Both the Lunsman and Garms c"ome
from the shipyards of C. G. White.
"Charley" White was in the old days one
of the beat known shipbuilders in Califor
nia. From his place at Alameda some of
the fastest vessels that ever sailed 'out
of the Golden Gate were launched. .But
then he, fell on evil days and finally had
to remove . to Everett. This was nearly
three years ago, and now the old master
builder's friends will be glad to hear that
his hand has not lost its cunning and that
he is again trimming out vessels second
to none on the coast. White is at present
in San Francisco on a vacation, but will
be back in Everett in time for the launch
ing of the Lunsman. .-.;â¢ Â¦â¢ Â¦:Â¦-.

LINCOLN, Nebr., Jan. Lâ Governor Sav
age will leave to-morrow for a short tour
of the Southern States, his final destina
tion being New Orleans. At the State
House it was understood that the pardon
of Joseph Bartley, the defaulting State
Treasurer, was to be the final act of ex
ecutive clemency for the present holiday
season. No local happening for months
has caused the sensation that did the re
lease of Bartley.
Governor Savage said to-night that he
had received many personal expressions
of approval of his act, as well as mes
sages of congratulation. Telegrams of
the same tenor poured Into the Bartley
home, and friends and former neighbors
called to express their good will, j In this
city there were also expressions condemn
ing the Governor's action, accompanied
by predictions that It would have an im
portant political bearing. -Bartley. would
make no statement. The theory that the
Governor was actuated by the belief that
the pardoned man would be in a position
to make' restitution of part of the half
million dollars lost to the State was
neither affirmed nor denled:

All commercial â¢ defaults numbered 1341,
with liabilities of $10,811,671, which com
pares with 1355 in 1900 owing $11,613,208. In
manufacturing there were 289 failures for
$3,095,095, against 308 in the previous year,
with liabilities of $3,201,665. Trading fail
ures numbered 1029, with a total indebted
ness of $6,845,329, compared with 1010 in
the previous year for $7,232,340.
In many ways the prosperous conditions
in the United States were shared across
the northern border, for commercial-fail
.ures in the" Dominion . of Canada were
fewer in number and smaller in amount
of liabilities than they were for the pre
ceding seven- years. As to banking insol
vencies the statement was even more fa
vorable, no one of the earlier years mak
ing as good an exhibit.
NEW YORK, Jan. Lâ Reports to *R. G.
Dun & Co. Â§how that the failures for the
year 1901 were 11,002 in number and $113,
092,376 In amount of - liabilities,, while ' of
banking' and other - fiduciary Institutions
there were seventy-four, insolvencies, in
volving $18,018,774-a total of 11,076 flefaults
and 5131,111,150 liabilities.:
These figures compare -very favorably
with the, 10,833 failures in 1900. with lia
bilities of $174,113,2S6, of which | fifty-nine
were banks for $35,617,563. Manufacturing
disasters in 1901 numbered 2441, with an in
debtedness of 544,960,983, compared ; with
2409 in the previous year owing $51,702,142,
while there were 7965 suspensions of trad
ers for $52,060,640. against 7S44 in 1903, with
liabilities of ,$59,415,592. The defaulted lia
bilities were 96 cents to each $1000 of bank
exchanges. A ratio to the number of firms
in business shows that the entire amount
of defaulted indebtedness averaged $94 33
for each concern. This amount compares
with $119 63 in 1900, while going back to
1S93 the average was $290 65. . . .

cicst gratifying result to the racing of
ficials. The $10,000 Burns handicap, to be
run on February 15, attracted seventy
four nominations. The Thornton stake, at
four miles, to be run on March 15, has
thirty-two nominations. The complete lisi
iollows:
RICH BURNS HANDICAP
ATTRACTS A BIG ENTRY
Ten Thousand Dollar Stake Closes With
Seventy-Four Nominations.
The tip on Alicia to take the final. mile
and a quarter selling affair seemed gen
eral, .and the mare made good. Played
from 4 to equal favoritism 'with Sunelio,
she disposed of Darlene at the wire with
apparent ease. Sunello quit af,ter leading
for a mile. Â¦ .Â¦Â¦ . :.: .{:. -^
Everything in the horse line that won
was backed until the bloated looking coin
pouches of the bookies crossing the bay,
resembled Indiana flapjacks on the, re
turn to this side. Every. winner, with the
exception of Bell Reed", was a favorite, j
: Winnie O'Connor '" returned :- : from' â¢ his
ranching tour fb Sacramento looking like
a hayseed and with good luck written all
over his serene countenance.. He piloted
Autolight to victory in - the New ;'. Year
handicap and did two other ' clever stunts
that made him. the ') hero of the exer
cises. Then, too, the first "baby" race of
the year, captured by Bell: Reed, aroused
much interest, resulting, in | the downfall
of Green Morris' JlO.OjW beauty; Artvis.
Beaten, but by no means disgraced,, it' is
a Bank of England note to a counterfeit
dollar, that the big fellow Â¦ will slam the
door in the 'faces of the two that led him
out next time they meet. \ . - "
Thure were but seven starters J in , the
handicap, which was worth 51600 to the
winner and was decided over one mile
and a furlong. Autolight, carrying top
weight with Vesuvian, was installed an
8 to 5 favorite on his class and this price
prevailed throughout. About : the - only
plunge made on an outsider was that on
The Fretter, a 92 pounder, whose price
was forced from 10 down to 5. With
scarcely a perceptible delay, "Jake" Holt
man sent the Held away to a perfect start,
Varro and Rosormonde acting as pace
makers. Before reaching the stretch Red
fern, on The Fretter, had tacked on : to
the front Â¦ position and O'Connor, had
moved ud' with the favorite. Gradually
O'Connor mowed down The Fretter's lead
with the brown horse, . finally winning
about all out by less than a length, with
Vesuvian at their saddle skirts. It was a
popular win aiv*: O'Connor received, well
merited applarje for his effort. '
Tommy Burns started in the year by
putting Royalty over the plate, winner of
the mile three-year-old event. The Sink
entry closed equal favorite with Landseer
and won easily, after Cathello had made
the pace to the stretch. Larry. Wilt, a 20
to 1 outsider, dropped along in time to
beat Landseer a neck for the place. Â¦
Next came the kindergarten sprint, with
twelve baby racers facing,: â¢ the V; barrier.
Artvis, the giant Goldfinch-Memento colt,
closed favorite, backed from: 4*to a 2. The
winner turned up in Bell Reed,, a chestnut
colt by Captive, and 6, to 1". in: the ring,
which won easily .from Amoruna,*: the
Burns & Waterhouse entry. Quicker, to
get away, the- others outbroke the favorite
and at the head of the stretch his -chance,
of getting through looked dim. By clever
piloting though O'Connor; did get a small
piece of the plum pudding.
Sombrero, the strapping - chestnut Â¦ colt
from Green Morris' -stable, took the Santa
Rosa handicap at six furlongs in swing-:
ing fashion. He carried 116 pounds and
after O'Connor had waited on. Sister
Jeanie and Legal Maxim to the stretch
went on, winning by three lengths in
1:13. Magi outgained Escalante, getting
the place by more, than a length. Botany
was left at the post. : Â¦ - â¢ â¢
Matt Hogan laid low quite an aggrega
tion of sprinting talent in the fifth event.
With Bulimaain the saddle the Wagner
gelding was always prominent, eventually
leading out Saul of Tarsus two lengths .
Cousin Carrie quit after leading to the
stretch. .
The betting ring -was jammed to the
uncomfortable point with speculators, big
and little. And perhaps \ the" memory, of
this huge holiday throng will not linger
long in the memory of most of the layers
of odds.
AN inkling '; . of rain conveyed
through gloomy lowering clouds
. that threatened to . usher in .the
new year with unpropitious rac
ing weather did not in j the ; least
dampen the ardor of: thousands of local
and Oakland turf admirers yesterday,; for
the banner crowd of' the season , flocked
to the track over the- bay. s The spacious
grand stand ; was "filled from end to end,
the fair sex predominating.

The mysterious stabbing affray at the
corner of Third and Mission streets late
New Year's eve in which Ed Barry, a
coalpasser on the Sheridan, received a
dangerous wound in the throat, has not
yet buen entirety solved. A man who
claims that his name is Cornelius Fitz
gerald was arrested yesterday by Officer
R. H. Tobin on. suspicion and brought
before Barry for identification. The In
jured man was unable to say that Fitz
gerald waÂ» the knife wielder, but he
identified Fitzgerald as the man with
whom he had an altercation earlier in the
evening-. Despite Barry's inability to pos
itively connect Fitzgerald with the crime
the police believe that he is the right
man. They have locked him up on a
charge of assault to commit murder.
Barry was removed yesterday from the
Central Emergency Hospital to his Bis
ter's home at 34 Harriet street. He re
ceived a very dangerous wound in the
throat, extending almost from ear to ear.
Barry has not yet given the police a
lucid account of his, doings on New Year's
eve.- Th<5 police have learned, however,
that Barry was accosted by Fitzgerald On
Third street and /asked for some money.
The demand was refused and a quarrel
followed, during which Barry had his
throat cut.

any more conditional gifts to colleges. It
was his intention, he said, to : give the
rest of his wealth â probably $3,000,000 or
$4,000,000â outright in the course of the
next ffcw years to the colleges which have
accomplished the most with what he has
given them in the past. â¢ j
"Every cent I give away after the end I
of this year,", he added, "Will go straight
out . to the institutions . I * have already
helped. There are thirty of them in all.
mostly in the West, and I am going to.
look them all over next year and make
up* my -mind.' The colleges that have
done well, that have saved the endow
ment and used it in the right' way will
get the ; money. "

Pearsons has already decided on, He did
not nay so directly, but his. praise of

them.

CHICAGO, Jan. l.-Dr.i D. K. Pearsons,
the Chicago philanthropist, made a New

which are expecting to , profit by. his
bounty.' There are eight of these colleges
and 1500,000 of the doctor's money Is wait

BLUM WEDDING
At 3:30 o'clock Chief Croker announced
that he , had the fire under â¢ control. A
rough estimate of the present damage is
125.000.
The guests of the Morton House Were
taicen to other hotels in the vicinity to be
cared for, and many of the men had time
to go back to their rooms to save their
valuables. The excitement in the hotel
Â¦was added to by the liremen dragging
long lines or hose through the halls so
that they could get the streams to play pit
the rear of the theater. There were wild
Bcenes in the hotel as the guests, porters, .
waiters and maids ran screaming to the
street. Many of the women fainted and
were carried out, but a. search of the
hotel seemed to satisfy the police that all
were able to reach places of safety.
While the fire department was trying to
overcome the fire in the basement several
nremen. went into the main theater and
carried out the tanks containing seven
seals, comprising Woodward's troupe.
Meanwhile lines of hose were carried to
the stage and held in readiness should
the flames break through the floor from
the basement. This basement is called
fireproof. It was one mass of flame from
end to end, and on the strength of its
fireproof qualities depended the safety of
the theater proper.
The rapidity with which the flames
spread turough tne theater was because
oi a quantity of oils, paints and a huge
mass of scenery which was in the stor
age room. Tne fumes from miÂ» lnnam
iuabie stuff hampered the nremen in their
wont, as they were repeatedly driven
from the basement to the .street. At 2:45
a. m. Chief Croker announced that ne
had hopes of confining the theater tire to
the basement of the theater and also of
preventing its spread further to the east
v/ard of tne two stores burned.
By 2 o'clock the ilames had spread with
'remarkable rapidity, and it seemed as if
the liremen wouid not be able to prevent
their spread to every part of the bunding.
At z:&> u.-m. the names wei'e. rapidiy

ly two email stores, the clothing <store of
iienson & (Jo. and tne cigar store of Alan
uel Diaz. ' . â¢
THere were 300 guests in the hotel, who
were hurriedly notified, and made their
escape to the street clad in their, night
frarments. The halls and corridors of the
hotel were- filled with smoke and the
guests from the upper floors were com
pelled to grope their way to the street.
So far as known they all got out in
safety. Keith's Theater is a six-story
building and the Aiorton is five stories.
NEW YORK, Jan. 2.â Fire was discov
ered early this morning in , the engine
room of Keath's Union Square Theater.
The flames were first seen by the engi
neer of the Morton House, which adjoins
the theater, and he gave the alarm.

"The Two Sisters," Denman Thompson
and George Ryer's play, seems to fill the
bill, up at the .Central^Theater. It has
been a strong- success with the Central
clientele a_nd has filled the house in satis
fying fashion every night. It is a do-i
rnestic drama on the order of "The Old
Homestead" and is the vehicle for pathos,
humor and the more homely sentiments.
There are many pretty scenes in the play
that is finely mounted and well plaved
throughout the large cast. "Lost in New
York" will follow.
"Charley's Aunt" is another bill in
which the holiday spirit reigns. It is be
ing given at the Alcazar with much spirit
and fur, and the versatile company is
seen at its best therein. Frank Bacon
ns Babberlv. Howard Scott as Solicitor
Spettigue, M. 1* Alsop, Henry Shumer,

Wycherly. all appear to advantage in the
farce and Oza Waldrop has achieved a
nice little nersonal success as E!a De
laney. "The Wife" will follow.
Yesterday's matinee at the Tivoii was
like a huge flower garden, with the hun
dreds of bright child faces that adorned
the old opera-house. Kows on rows of
them, all as happy as kings and queens
are supposed to be, and ail clapping little
hands and laughing for all they were
worth at the funny antics of Ferris Hart
man and company. The children say
â¢Ferris is all right"; "Annie Meyers is a
peach'"; Webb is a dandy"; the whole
show "a beaut." and against such artless
criticism there is no appeal. The children,
as always, happen to be right. It is a
good show, with clean, wholesome fun
rrom beginning to end, and shouldn't be
missed by any one who likes a good
laugh.

President Sedgwick believes that there !
should be little or no State regulation ~ of !
what shall appear in textbooks. "Scarcely
had science and education," he said,
"freed themselves from the church when
they began to be threatened by subjec
tion to the state. While it Is right that
the youth should be taught the dangers
of alcohol, I believe that it is odious and
unreasonable that the exact amount of
such teaching should be prescribed by
law; that the method of teaching by text
books and the space devoted to it in the
textbook should be legally regulated by
law, but especially that the kind of text
books, used should be largely determined
by a self-constituted and unofficial oli
garchyâleaders of a propaganda which
is neither educational nor scientific."
The effects of these peculiar laws, he
said, had been to create a peculiar class
of textbooks, some of which were pre
pared by competent writers, but most
were inferior and some were distinctly
bad.
"No wise educator," he continued, "who
has given any attention to the subject can
deny that the influence of this powerful
propaganda has been in most respects in
jurious to the proper' teaching of physiol
ogy'and hygiene in the lower schools.
Teachers, principals and superintendents,
and even school committees, are seldom
able to speak with perfect frankness on
the subject from the fear of influence. In
my opinion it is time for a body of sci
entific men like the American Society of
Naturalists and the American Association
for the Advancement of Science to put on
record their opinion that the subjugation
under which science and education are to
day suffering from the temperance prop
aganda has become intolerable."
The election of officers of the American
Association of Naturalists resulted as foN
lows: President, J. M. Cattell of Colum
bia; vice presidents, L. O. ' H.oward of
Washington and r>. P. Penhallow of Mc-
Gill University; secretary, K. G. Harrison
of Johns Hopkins; treasurer, M. ' M. Met
calf of the Women's College, Baltimore.
' A resolution was adopted by the society
favoring the bill pending In Congress pro
viding- for the i preservation"- of the cliff
dwellings in Colorado by forming there a
national park. Â¦
Scientific temperance Instruction has grown
to such proportions and has gained such power
as to dominate almost all Instruction In ele
mentary physiology . and hygiene In America.
It is right, of course, that pupils should, be
taught the danger of alcohol and .narcotics, but
teachers often go too far, and it even appears
that all instruction in physiology and hygiene
in public schools has passed to a great and un
justifiable- extent in the hands and under .the
subjection of tho temperance propaganda.
President Sedg wick's address was upon
"The Modern Subjection of Science and
Education- to Propaganda." He sald'ih
part:
"It is a notorious and disgraceful fact,"
said Professor Sedgwick, "with a view of
pleasing a seU'-oonstituted oligarchy, that
some writers have even 1 made alcoholic
instruction the beginning, the' middle and
the end of their textbooks. Of such book3
it may be truly said that : they have no
permanency of their own, and with. dif-:
ficulty Would be preserved in schools.", Â«
CHICAGO, Jan.' i:â Scientific temperance
instruction as taught in the public schools
from the textbooks now in use, together
with anti-vivisection, anti-vaccination and

at a banquet to-night given by members
of the scientific societies now in Bession

years agp, the members of the

its spacious rooms at 421 Post

wives of the members and their invited
guests had an opportunity of gazing upon
the place where their husbands spend
their leisure hours. '
The rooms were prettily decorated in
holly and Christmas greens. Tables were
set in every corner and the members and
guests enjoyed themselves at the festal
board. Apt quotations from Schiller and
Goethe were cleverly illustrated in carica
ture and these hung on every wall. The
"Mayor 'Phelan expressed the -hope that
he would be able to continue his yearly
visits, although it would be in the capa

An accident that nearly ended fatally
happened last night at 7:30 o'clock when
Mrs. Townsend, wife of "William S.
Townsend,; of 1220 Valencia street, slipped
in front of Valencia street car No. 22 on
Market street, opposite Mason. Mrs.
Townsend was In company with her hus
barfd and several ladies at the time of
the accident. The party was crossing
Market street and all but Mrs. Townsend
stopped to allow the car to pass. It Is
not known just how the accident hap
pened, but It is thought that owing to
the slippery condition of the pavement
Mrs. Townsend fell in front of the ap
proaching car. Gripman Harry Odgsen
sounded his gong and put on the brake,
but it was too late to avert an accident.
The car caught Mrs.. Townsend and eye
witnesses state that she was dragged,
fully twenty feet by the fender. The car
had to be pushed back before it was pos
sible to extricate her from beneath the
front of the dummy. "Willing hands as
sisted the distracted husband in carrying
tho unfortunate woman to the Zlnkand

the Emergency Hospital. On* the arrival
of the hospital ambulance Townsend de
cided to take his wife to their home. The

found that Mrs. Townsend had sustained

SLIPS IN FRONT
OF PASSING CAR
A rear-end \ collision between , a yellow
and a green fear, on Powell street at the
foot of the grade between' Sacramento and
Clay ... streets at 5:30 o'clock last evening
resulted . in the possibly fatal injury of
Reuben Harris, eleven years of age, and a
severe shaking up^f or the passengers who
crowded . both cars.' ' The yellow car was
badly battered and its conductor suffered
numerous contusions. Â¦. Â¦, * Â¦
The accident was "due ' to a,"greasy"
track, caused by the slight rain that had
fallen. prior to that hour,, and the motor
man's failure to keep control of the car
as it coasted down the hill toward Clay
street.- Â¦ :
The yellow car Â¦, had stopped \ while a
Clay street car passed in front of it. The
green car, No. 470, with W. F.: Wren as
motorman, -was following but a; block be
hind the yellow car.- -
.Motorman Wren loosed the hold, of the
grip on the> cable at the Sacramento
street crossing and as the car passed over
the level crossing and started down hill
he applied the brakes. Either he did not
set them tightly enough or they failed to
check the Â¦ car on account - of the slippery
track. The car speeded down the hill with
increasing momentum, Wren throwing all
his weight on the brake lever as he real
ized the danger of collision.' i :-*-.'
'Some of the passengers riding on- the
front of the car saw that a collision could
not be averted and jumped to save them
selves. The runaway car struck the yel
low one with a crash that sounded like
the discharge of heavy arullery. The
breaking Â» of glass and the crunching of
wood and Iron was followed by the
shrieks of women and children, and the
two cars were emptied of their passen
gers with an alacrity.' born -of panic. Â¦-
At first 7 it was feared that many had
been hurt,' but when the flurry had some
what subsided none showed injuries ex
cept the Harris boy and the conductor.
The; boy was riding on the rear .plat
form of the yellow car. He was knocked
off and he lay unconscious on the ground.
Passengers picked him up and carried him
to the sidewalk, and a little later, pending
the arrival of the ambulance,- he was
taken to the -office of Dr. Minnie -Worley
on Clay street. He was found to be suf
fering from. an ugly contusion on the back
of his head. When the ambulance arrived
the boy was taken. to his home at 13^.
John street. He is - the -i son of Mr. and
Mrs.' H.' Harris. Dr. Horace Ijaidlaw, who
was called to treat the little sufferer, said
at a late hour last' night that the boy was
in a semi-conscioUs condition. He- said
further that though his diagnosis was not
complete, he feared there had been a
fracture of the skull. - Â¦ .

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 2, 1903.
Benedict Pfarrer, a builder and con
tractor, . residing at 3510 Twenty-first
street, was found dead in his bed yester
day morning, having been asphyxiated by
gas that had escaped from a three-hole
gas plate. The body had been lying there
about three days. One of the burners of
the gas plate was open and gas was es
caping from it.
The milkman who left milk for the
family detected the odor of illuminating
gas proceeding from the lower flat, which
was occupied by Pfarrer alone. He no

the son, was the first to find the body
of his father. .
The old man was very careless about
turning off the gas on the gas plate, and
had been warned several times by his
daughter-in-law and others. He was
rather eccentric and was often . absent
from his home for several days at a time.
It was for this reason that his family did
not pay any attention to his disappear
ance. Asthma troubled him a good deal,
and his sense of smell was very much im
paired. For that reason he was unable to
know whether the gas was escaping or
not.
Pfarrer was a native of Switzerland and
65 years old.

An investigation of the affair will be
made by the officer In charge of Alcatraz
and forwarded to the departmental mili
tary headquarters. Â¦.Â¦Â¦' r~
Medical aid was immediately summoned
and the poisoned men were taken to the
post hospital. Mitchell died on Sunday
night. The other prisoners who were suf
fering from tlje poison were â¢ pronounced
out of danger In a few hours -and were
put back to work Monday morning.
The bodies of Canfleld and Mitchell
were sent on Tuesday to Angel Island
and buried in the military cemetery of the
post
A representative of The Call who vis
ited Alcatraz Island last night was re
ceived at the wharf by Lieutenant A. Mc-
Intyre of the coast artillery, the officer
of the day. He verified the facts of the
occurrence as given above.
CanSeld and Mitchell were under sen
tences of five years' Imprisonment, and
were tried by court-martial in the Philip
pine Islands. Lieutenant Mclntyre stated
that he did not know the military records
of the two dead soldiers or the names of
the others who had partaken of the poi
sonous drink.
The first intimation the authorities had
that anything was wrong was early Sun
day morning, when Fred Canfield, a pris
oner, was found dead In his cell. \ John
Mitchell, another prisoner, was discovered
In & dying condition. Two other prisoners
Â¦were also found to be suffering from al
coholic poisoning.
Rumors were circulated through the
city last evening that a number of mili
tary prisoners on Alcatraz Island had
broken jail on the previous night and had
raided the medical stores, securing a
quantity of wood alcohol, and that some
of the men had died from drinking the
liquid.
The officers at the. Presidio were reti
cent on the matter, and every attempt
was made to keep the deaths secret.
It was learned, however, that several
of the military prisoners employed in the
kitchen had stolen a quantity of wood al
cohol and lemon extract last Saturday
night and conveyed the same to their
cells.
