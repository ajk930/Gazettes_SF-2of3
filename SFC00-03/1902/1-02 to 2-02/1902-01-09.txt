pleasantly with his successor and was

The chief officer hurried on deck, in
formed the captain of the state of affairs,
and the four boats carried by the ship
*were ordered to be launched. Two were
put off on the side of the ship where seas
were continually breaking over the steam-
The night was black as pitch. There
was not a lighthouse within fifty miles
and not the remotest indication of where
land lay. The gale still swept in from
the west and. the warning noise of break
ers was drowned by the roaring of the
eea around the ship.
According to the accounts obtained by
Captain Nicholson the vessel was going
at half speed, when she suddenly struck
the rocks on Gray Point. She pounded on
the rocks head on until she could get no
further and then her stern was swung
eround by the gale so that one side was
completely exposed to the seas. This
probably tore out her bottom, for when
the chief ofScer went below to investigate
he found tht water coming in at a rapid
rate and thu coal going out as "though
through a sieve through the bottom or
the Iron steamer. The bow was punc
tured with holes which looked as if the
boat had been in collision, and altogether
she was a complete wreck. â¢
On Thursday the Bristol took the in
6lde passage, skirted the islands and kept
out of the storm. She passed the steamer
Cottage City, also bound northward,
Â¦which had got into a safe anchorage the
night before end stayed out of the way
of the wind. From there the Bristol
passed out to sea again to gain Dlxon's
Entrance, between Dundas Island and
Gray Point, on the southern end of Green
Island. She approached this vicinity af
ter midnight of Thursday and an iiour
later the disaster occurred.

The vessel had been on her fateful trip
eince New Tear's day. She was a day
and a half out from Nanaimo, with nearly
3000 tons of coal for the Tread well mine
en Douglass Island. She carried a small
shipment of lumber on her forward deck,
Jout this was washed off by the waves
Â¦which accompanied a gale that she en
countered ir crossing Queen Charlotte
The big stsamer is out of sight, except
the tops of her masts, and the shores of
the Island are strewn with pieces of her

that were washed off by the storm on the
night of the disaster.
News of the loss of the collier was
brought to the c^>' this evening by the
eteamer City of ' Seattle. That vessel
pa&sed the scene of the mishap on the
â¢way south. Captain Xicholson obtained
a list of the lost men and full particulars

VAN'COUVER. B. C. Jan. 8.-The
Eteamer Bristol, which for fifteen years
has been carrying cargoes In and out of
the Golden Gate, and lately became a

Friday morning at Green Island, fifty
miles Â¦ northwest of Port Essinglon, on
the western British Columbia coast.
Seven lives were lost. Captain Mclntyre,

not liberally recognized, in the ap

Some of the city's employes eee in this
remark a veiled intention to encompass
the dismissal of subordinates -wherever
"If there should, come' to your notice
any misconduct on the part of any of the
public officials of the city,' or on the part
of^any person having deaflings with lt.M
invite you freely to report it to me so that'
I may take appropriate - action in the
premises."
Presages of Dismissal.
Mayor Schmitz also delivered a brief
address at his office to his appointees on
the commissions just before going to the
Supervisors' meeting. Probably his most
important .utterance.' and one which will
make some subordinates in the- city gov
ernment uneasy, was this:.* -
The only point . on" which _ there seemed
to be a unanimity of .'opinion between
Schmitz and Phelan was the" need ;- of
amendments to the" charter. Phelan ac
knowledged that the organic law pos
sesses defects, and Schmitz declared that
it needs revision. ' â Â¦.;-..
Then when Phelan threw bouquets at
his Civil Service : Commission. Schmitz
said of the same commission that it would
be a municipal benefit: if it should 'obey
its own rule to abstain from offensive
political Intrigue. FinaJly, when Phelan
asserted that his Board of Education was
conducting the v School Department in the
Interest of the children, Schniltz' asserted
that it was not conducted in the interest
of teachers, who "were obliged discontent-,
edly to stand by while political influence
and favoritism placed new men'or, women
over them." t
Again, Phelan lauded the Board of
Health for stamping out an Oriental dis
ease and Schmitz scored the same board
for "doing injury to the commercial and
labor interests of San Francisco by foist
ing upon the world sensational and ill
founded reports of the existence of the
dread plauge.". . '
The two addresses were diametrically
opposite on many points, which caused
the knowing ones to smile. For instance,
Phelan paid a glowing, tribute, to the
Board of Public Works for its economical
administration. Mayor, Schmitz said that
it would 'be a great municipal improve
ment if $10 of salaries was not required
to ll of improvements done by the same
board. â¢ Â¦ !
, Two Points of View.
The difference in the ways which the
respective addresses of Mayor Schmitz
and ex-Mayor Phelan were received by the
spectators was apparent.- Phelan read his
type-written address, through hurriedly
and not once did his remarks bring forth
any applause. At times during the read-
Ing his successor in office smiled cynically
at statements with which he disagreed.
On the contrary Mayor Schmitz was ap
plauded frequently, and though it Is true
there were many of his supporters in the
audience, he told some trite truths about
the former administration which seemed
to strike home.
By far the greatest interest centered In
thi chambers of the Board of Supervisors,
where Mayor Phelan retired in favor of
Mayor-elect Schmitz and seven Super
visors displaced as many more city fathers
who had either been defeated or had de
clined renomination. Every available inch
of room was occupied by spectators who
were present to hear Mayor Schmitz out
line his future policy in his inaugural mes
sage and incidentally to listen to the re
tiring Mayor's farewell address.

Miller during the trial, the counsel for the
defense s having continually referred to
Miller , as, . "Danny" Miller,- as General
Post's "bodyguard" and in other con
temptuous ways. Post told Raker in open
court, that was. a better man in
every respect than Raker, and that the
lawyer for the defense would not dare
address Miller in such terms outside of

not a man whom one could insult.. Raker
continued to insult Miller, who indicated

rapidly getting the mastery over his se4f

Almost a Tragedy in Court.
Never in a California court has there
been heard a more remarkable recital.
The witness told how a few men had got
together, decided upon the lynching and
proceeded to lay their plans as coolly, and
with as little feeling as the hunter about
to bring down a deer. Aged Judge Myers,
almost blind and on the verge of the
grave,' selected the ropes to be used, tied
the- knots and . gave counsel to the ring
leaders as to their method of procedure.
No humane â¢ ins tine t mani f es t ed - itself, ac
cording to the witness, while the mob was
hurrying its * ca'ptives off to . their doom.
One victim was beaten with a wagon
spoke and the others shared in a measure
this brutality while being dragged to the
execution ground. Even old Calvin Hall's
gray hairs and tottering gatt did not win
for him respite from these outrages dur
ing his last few minutes on earth.
Hutton withheld no facts. He described,
the events prior to and during the lynch
ing with faithful attention to details and
did not attempt to hide the part he took
in plotting the death of the five Lookout
prisoners and carrying out the sentence
imposed by the mob.
ALTURAS, Jan. 8.â John Hutton, thk
self-confessed participant in the quint
uple lynching at Lookout last May, 1 told
the story of that frontier tragedy in court
to-day. He was the only witness examined
during the day in the trial of James W.
Brown and his testimony was so dramatic
and sensational in its details that the
spectators who crowded the courtroom
heard! it with breathless attention from
beginning to end.

the lfst of - committees, which has : been
Eubllshed, but Mayor Schmitz ruled that
e would not entertain public business,
but would consider the meeting as a cau
cus for the purpose of /agreeing ion the

Batisfied with the representation accord
ed his political associates on the commit
tees. It was determined Â¦ to . adjourn , for
five minutes, after which recess the com
mittee appointments were approved.
Brandenstein began a -campaign' for

o'clock.. Brandenstein stated that his busi

obliged to attend the meetings in 'daytime,
and Curtis thought the board should meet
at 'night in order to give men a
chance to attend. Braunhart made a plea
for the usual hour of 2:30 o'clock, arguing
that it was not in consonance with . the
eight-hour provision Â¦ of -,the charter â¢;â¢ to
compel -the clerks to , work overtime.
Wynn thought : the wage-earners , should
be given an opportunity to witness -the

quently happens; that a million dollars or more
is In the sole and absolute charge of these of
ficials and of their deputies and the amount
of their present bond is certainly not sufficient.
I have looked somewhat carefully also" into
the distribution of the duties of the deputies
and officials of the tax office. - 1 find . two de
partments independently handling large
amounts of the city's fundsâ the license tax
department and the tax department . proper.
I believe that there should be a bonded cashier
for each . department and 1 would recommend
that the Tax Collecteor be allowed the . ap
1 ointment of a cashier for the license depai t
nient, who shall give bond in sufficient amount.
Provided, however, the appropriation for the

increased and that the clerical force of the
Tax Collector's office be reduced in an amount
corresponding to the amount of such addi

Supervisors May Legislate Only.
Another feature . of the charter that has
worked admirably is tho separation pf legisla
tive and executive functions. Under The enff-
ter the Board of . Supervisors is a legislative
body, having no patronage in Its gift except 1U
own clerka. Under the consolidation act tnÂ«
board appointed gardeners, police-* court clerks.
prosecuting attorneys, janitors, a fish ana game
warden and two fire commissioners, ana us
confirmation was required for the appointment
of the license collector and gas inspector. Now
the Board of Supervisors is engaged exclusively
In passing laws or ordinances for the govern
ment of the city. It raises the revenue, but
does not disburse It. The Mayor appoints tne
administrative boards without confirmation, and
the subordinates are taken from the civil serv
ice lists. The responsibility which is confer
red upon the Mayor, and his power to remove
and appoint, for cause, concentrates authority
and makes the government more cohesive. His
position 13 respectable and respected. The
consolidation act divided 1 the city Into twelve
districts or wards. The charter has obliter
ated the wards and provided that the Super
visors, eighteen In number, shall be elected at
large. This has sensibly Improved the per
sonnel' of the board, the conventions havlns
the whole city from -which to make selections.
I desire to say that the high reputation which
the Board of Supervisors, serving for the last
two years, has enjoyed, and the confidence
with which it was regarded, is a tribute not
onjy to the -character of the men who have
had the honor of serving under tho charter,
but to the charter Itself. It was the first Board
of Supervisors without rings, and it was the
first Board of Supervisors that was practically
ever re-elected. The abolition of the ward sys
tem and' the Increase of the number of Super
visors from twelve to eighteen has by practi
cal experience of the last two years been
demonstrated to be a success. Â¦
Ag-ainst Special Privileges.
.The City Attorney has advised the board in a
recent opinion that the charter contemplates
only the passage of general laws, and discoun
tenances special- privileges. So hereafter no
special privileges should be granted, but the
general ordinances should be so amended as to
Include any pubflc benefit which it may be be
lieved a special privilege could confer upon the
city. No citizen should be denied, under Ilka
conditions, a privilege which ia granted to
another. . , . -. Â¦Â¦-.Â¦' . ' ' .'
I believe that the true meaning of the char
ter is' that the commissioners are responsible
to the Mayor, and that he, as an elective offi
cer, is responsible to the people, and that
there should be a loyal co-operation -between
them; but that the commissioners should be al
lowed a wide discretion in putting policies Into
force and effect, and the Mayor should not In
terfere unless there be an abandonment on the
part 'of the commissioners or the people's de
clared aod deliberate will, or if they suffer
flagrant abuses to creep into the administra
tion. The charter gives the Mayor the right to
attend meetings of the commissioners and to
make suggestions. Due weight should be given
to his suggestions on account of the Importance
of his office and of his responsibility to the
people. But within their Jurisdiction the
boards or commissions are independent bodies.
..: The 2 financial; condition of ; the 'city, 'as will
be apparent fromthls showing/ has ; never -btien
better.- Us net. funded; debt ,1s' only '$,11,000 a
condition unparalleled among cities of the world
of Jta i size and . importance.'-^ It . has property : In
lands and. buildings the. value of which is es
timated-at $20,000,000. It 'is therefore in a po
sition ; toMmprove s Its r municipal- equipment, by
Issuing bonds,, which, as required by law shall
run for 'forty; years at a small : per "cent inter
est. V^The proceeds will" constitute ' the city's
capital, which.' when invested in its business, of
making a model municipality,- will come back
" '.-'. The .credit of the.; city, therefore, r Is ' excel
lent. ;.Tne . charter, provides for a solvent gov
ernment. 'No warrant can ' be , drawn except
upon , an -. unexhausted', specific Â¦ appropriation
That { provision Â¦ and < the : one-twelfth ' limitation
makes us pay ass' we-go.'v :Â¦'--â¢ â
Credit of :the i City ; Is : Excellent.
The first year under -the charter the assess
ment roll was assumed .to be $375,000,000,' and
the tax levy raised a sufficient sum to meet the
current expenses of the government and allowed
about $40,000 for improvements: -but as a mat
ter of fact the Assessor subsequently 'returned
a roll of $410,000,000, and hence for. that- year
there was a large surplus unappropriated by the
budget, which, under the ' charter ; rule, passed
Into â¢ the Â¦ surplus ' of* the Â¦ following fiscal Â¦ yÂ«ar
beginning July 1. 1901. With other Items, the
surplus in the generalfund amounted to $297, -
000. J Again, in the. first fiscal- year under the
charter, le*jr was made for Interest and sink
ing funds on bonds which had ' been voted by
the-' people, but > were Invalidated by the Su
preme Court. That money was also available
as surplus and amounted to $225,000, making
approximately, a surplus available, for this fiscal
year of $520,000. The board appropriated from
this surplus to the Board of, Public Works,
principally for street. improvements and build
ings, a sum Aggregating, $200,000, and for the
payment of old claims authorized by constitu
tional'amendment, for which the city: creditors
had waited for ten years, the sum of $292.Â»D0
This included payment of ; over $100,000 to the
teachers of. the School Department.' So the out
going administration may: Justly claim. that it
has redeemed the credit of. the city, and while
paying its. debts, is able to provide for exten
sive â¢ public improvements without --going be
yond the dollar limit of taxation. ; .<
The unusual sources of revenue. for this fis
cal year are due, therefore, to the interest and
sinking fund accumulation and the unexpected
increase of last \ year s - assesment : roll ; -Â¦Â¦ but
apart - from Â¦ these- considerations, '-Â¦ as - we tmve
seen," it is reasonable to expect. more than $230 -
000, as a surplus in excess of the cost of maln-
, tainlng Uhe i government to be devoted to pub
lic Improvements.-; This Is. shown on the report
of Cyril EoWllllams,. the expert of the Finance
. Committee. ; dated December .-19. 1901. *
Figures on Taxation.
The charter has next In order provided an
economical and: progressive government. Under
the old law there was practically no limit upon
taxation, and the rate for State and city and
county purposes has within ' the past Â¦ seven
years been as high as $2 15, against a rate this
year of $1,556, of which $1,076 Is for city pur
poses and the balance for State. The charter

cept the maintenance of parks and provision for,
interest and sinking funds.' This is an organic
check upon extravagance, Â¦ antl â¢ when once the
funds are apportioned by the budget, they are
inviolable and -cannot be diverted during the
year. " This Insures a paid up government and
prevents deficits at the end of each fiscal year,
a calamity which visited the city perennially
under the old system. In June, 1900, the bud
get was as follows :. For maintenance of 'the
city.' government proper, $5,146,700; for Interest
and -sinking funds for -proposed bonds, for hos->
pltal, sewers, school* houses and parks, $446,

1901, -for the city was $5,825,100, of which the
receipts . f r<Jm other Â¦ sources * 'Â¦ than taxation

were from the' State school fund,. $695,000, and
from licenses. -$470,000. : In the -year 1838-1809,

licenses collected was< $505,082. As the char

Says Government Is Economical.
While the charter . Is not free from defects
common to all human documents, . which may
now be cured by amendment if necessary, still
it has proved Its worth and conferred Innum
erable benefits upon our people. It has. as we
have seen; freed us from the Legislature and
trom interference by the Governor. . Many of
the' other great cities of the country still loofe
to the Legislature for their laws, whereas San
Francisco has advanced from that stage, it
has introduced a civil service system, which
applies under the decisions of the courts to
all offices, boards and commissions except the
Sheriff. Treasurer. County Clerk Recorder.
Coroner and Asgessor. which are called county
Offices. This condition arose from the failure
of constitutional amendment 8%, -Article JU.
to mention, in* addition to "terms and com
pensation", therein expressed, the word Â«uall
.flcatlon." That is to say, according to the su
preme Court it was not competent â¢- lor tne
charter to require the subordinates of coÂ« n^
officers to have certain qualifications, to be
demonstrated by..- civil service examination
(This was unfortunate and can be remedied by
proposing a constitutional , amendment, wnicn
no doubt will be done. The Civil Service Com
missioners â¢ have industriously and" conscien
tiously classified the civil service of the city
and have held , numerous examinations, as a
result of which they have prepared eligible
lists for the several offices and departments
amenable to the law. Â¦
There are In the city government, in round
numbers, 3400 positions. Including teachers, po
licemen and firemen, and uver sixty per cent of
this number are subject to the civil service pro
visions of the charter, -and if we aid
1004 employes of the School Department, hold
ing under a-clvll service of its own, the per
centage would be about ninety per cent. It
is accepted by all disinterested officials, who
have had experience with the system, that It
not only promotes efficiency, but protects a
public officer, who with a trained staff enters
upon the discharge of his duties. It confers
an' equal 'benefit upon -the- men who are em
ployed and who are protected so long as they
faithfully perform their work. I trust that this
system, which has been so successfully begun.
wlll.be protected. by the Incoming administra
tion against the assaults tÂ«f its enemies.
Charter Not Free From Defects.
â¢ To the Honorable, the Board of Supervisor!:
It has been customary for the retiring Mayor
to make a .statement of the condition of the
municipality during his administration. As - 1
have sent messages to the Board of Supervisors
on' the occasion of my inauguration - on three
different occasions I will confine myself more
particularly f to the last two years under the
charter government. . '
When, five years ago, I assumed the duties
of the office of Mayor and for the three years
thereafter,- the city lived under what ' was
known as the consolidation act. which con
sisted of various statutes which had been
passed from time to time by the Legislature,
and the Governor of the State exercised certain
powers over the municipality in the appoint
ment of .boards or commissions. . Every l^eina
lature tinkered with the municipality, creating
new offices and Inflicting upon our people un
reasonable and unjust legislation. -On f our
different - occasions our citizens had^tnea 10
throw off the legislative yoke by. proposing
freeholders charters, which for inherent defects
failed at the polls. I . had . the honor Im
mediately after my first election to Â»PPÂ° Int a
freeholders convention of one , hundred, a
thoroughly "representative body, which pro
ceeded to draft an advisory charter, and to
nominate a board of freeholders "five"
legal expression. The nominees of this con
vention were elected and the charter thay
framed after having been voted on by tne peo
ple and' approved by the Legislature, became,
on the 8th day of January. 1900. the organic
law of the city. From that. moment San Fran
cisco was practically exempt from legislative
interference in its municipal Â¦ affairs and De
came a free city. That charter has now had
a trial of two years. The outgoing admin
istration has had, therefore, the responsibility
of inaugurating It and defending its provisions
when attacked in the courts, of interpreting it
in dally practice and of establishing precedents.
;, .' his idea, the : charter . hag pro
duced In municipal affairs. He admitted
that the charter is not free from defects,
but claimed that these could be remedied
by. amendments. He referred to the ex.
tremely .small funded .debt of" the city,,
but neglected to state that it was quite
as small before the charter went into ef
fect. - He , bestowed -compliments on the
.Commissioners of his own appointment
and expressed the opinion that the dollar
limit -yields ample funds for the (mainte
nance of the city government. He paid a
tribute to the city officials who had paistd
away. during his regime.: The. address (was
as follows:. -,â¢;.:â¢: V
EX-RIAYOR PHELAN'S addreiss
to the Board of Supervisors on
retiring irpm the office which. he
-has held for, five years past was
devoted principally to the im
provements < which, according to
. The men -who toll have been woefully mis
represented, and have been lamentably misun
derstood. Misunderstanding is frequently the
foot of all difficulty. The sentiment of. the
great majority of my fellow- workers is as
mine. It would surprise some of you to know
how widely diffused among them is a knowl
edge of the great industrial, social . and econ
omic questions, what profound study many
have given to them, and how conservative and
sensible most of them are. I am glad that to
me Is irlven the proud opportunity of proving
to all t.ae people of San Francisco, to her busi
ness ln'^rests as well as to the large and im
portant body of my friends, the â¢: laboring
masses, that mutual confidence and trust; re
ciprocal regard. and consideration will secure
permanent peace, continuous good feeling and
certain prosperity, to the merchants and to the
manufacturer, to wage-worker and employe
I trust that during my administration may
be established a broader and better under
standing, that there may be harmony in place
of discord, satisfaction in place of resentment,
peace Instead of strife. There should be a
friendly and sympathetic cohesion and co
operation of employer and employe, Â¦ and so far
as may be possible an avoidance of all indus
trial dissension and Industrial discontent. Com
mercial panics and strikes are usually forced
growths, and conditions which foster or
breathe them ebould not be encouraged. As I
bave eald on many occasions, capital must have
steady and secure Investment in order that la-
Toilers Are Misunderstood.
I wi6:s to represent to you In my own per
â¢on that the working classes of our community,
granted their equaf rights and fair treatment.'
will co-operate with their fellow-citizens in the
maintenance of law and of social order.
I pledge myself honestly and fairly to give
equal consideration and protection to all and
to ehow -neither favoritism nor prejudice for or
against any element or class. I do not believe
in radical measures, am essentially conserva
tive, but I shall demand for the wage-earner
the Earae conservative and fair treatment
which tls employer ever insists on. ' .
And in these sentiments I am not alone â the
major jwrtion of the wage-workers of San
Francis<s> are equally as conservative. I am
but the:r representative.
JCot o:sly during my entire campaign, but also
In my address to the convention of my party
before my nomination, no sentiment was more
enthusisistically received, more loudly applaud
ed by my hearers than such as I have just ut
tered. When in my first address I said, and I
meant it then 'as I mean it now, that I be
lieved ia the fair and friendly consideration of
invested caDital as correlative to similar con
siderations for organized labor, "the rafters
lalriy eaook."
When I eald that in the peaceful unlonof the
Â«rage-efxner and his peaceful and friendly af
filiation with those who employ him lies . the
(tope of an advancing civilization and the cer
tainty of a national prosperity, the cheers
te-ere deafening. When I said that I depre
cated violence and was in favor of peaceful
measures at all hazards, that I believe in equal
tepresentatlon for employer, as well as for em
ploye, for rich as well as for poor, for capital
M well as for labor, the applause was tremen
tous.
I embrace the occasion here to renew to the
people of San Francisco the pledges which I
made d urine my canvassing for office. I do
not sneak with one voice before election and
with siiother now. So far as I can control
the course of events, to the utmost limit of
my power, there shall during my term of office
be a cli'an and honest government, a fair and
just recognition of all classes, equal rights to
all and EDecial privileges to none. I repeat
my assurance to all the eonssrvative elements
of our municipality that the granting of repre
sentation to the wage earners of San Fran
cisoo in the affairs of our city government doet
not imiily the arrayal of labor against capi
tal, of employer acraiast employe, or the es
tafcllshrsent of any class distinction based or
wealth or social position, religion or any .foun
dation other than good citizenship and fair,
honest Sealing, but that it means on the-con
trary, that there will be no Industrial dis
turbancts, no social revolution, no Justified de
preciatiin of values, no danger to vested in
terests, no damage to private rights.
Equal Eights to Working Classes.
But"vbile I recognize the force and strength
whica the charter nas placed in my hands. I
realize that this Is not and shall not . be a
one-mart government. I desire and invite your
effective support and co-cperation. and on my
part I promise you fair and equitable consid
eration and assistance in everything which
makes lor the betterment of our city and her
people. . -.'. Â«.it "- ,
We can make of this city a great metropolis.
It is her manifest destiny and our duty in
this reswd is plain. We must put into effect
broad-minded, liberal ideas. The time of a
etralt- Jacket for San Francisco lias - almost
passed, and we may now look forward .with
much t.oue to her adornment with rajjes of
beauty and with vestments of tolerance . and
of faitli appropriate to her wealth and her
position among the cities of the earth.
To you. gentlemen, and to me is given the
privilege of assisting in her material pi ogress
and in the making of her brilliant history.
The people have endowed us with proud hon
ors. Let us live up to the obligations of our
position; let us Justify their confidence,
and hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, let us
together with the other officials of the city
labor and toil for a progressive, honest, busi
nesslike administration of her affairs.
Gentlemen of the Board of â¢ Supervisors : In
assuming the lmj-ortant and dignified station
to which the people of this city have elected
me, I wish to express a realizing sense of
the weighty and serious duties which have
devolved. uÂ»oa me as the chief executive, of fl

there had been too much fighting between
capital and labor and urged a cessation
of hostilities for all time. He found fault
â¢w ith the Soard of Public Works, â¢ the

mission and criticized the Board of Health
for a poH^y tending to Injure the com

punctuated by frequent applause on the
part of the spectators, many of whom
were his supporters when he ran for of

MAYt)R SCHMITZ. in his inaug
ural address to the Board of

urgad loyal co-operation on
the part of Commissioners and
It would be a distinct municipal betterment
.if Police' Commissioners would not throw the
weight of their great influence to one: side or
the other in an industrial â¢ contest, i I do not
wlshiit to be, understood that it is not * their
duty . at all hazards to preserve law and order
.But some of the unfakest acts known innocent
men attacked without cause or apparent ex
cuse, , may be among the results ' of an over
; zealous devotion to the ' cause [ of I one > side ' of
such a controversy. Â¦ We , should : have -better
schoolhouses : and more of . them. - - The Â¦ schools
must Â» be generally - looked after. The Â¦ hope of
our entire governmental system Is. based uoon
them. I Â¦ believe the time has arrived ' when
th city should pay more attention. to the proper
and permanent paving of its streets and should
restrict within reasonable limits their constant
Slap at Police Commission.
And equally obnoxious with this is the util
ization of a great department for the purpose
of creating a large municipal" expense or the
exploitation of personal ambitions or the se
curity of political notoriety. This may not
necessarily be corrupt, but if is ; not honest.
It would be a great municipal improvement if
Boards of Health would consider seriously the
danger and injury to the commercial and labor
interests of San Francisco. berore foisting upon
the % world sensational and -, Ill-founded reports
of the existence of ' the . dread bubonic plague
in our midst; if a Board of Public Works would
put- more of the taxpayers' money into the im
provement of our streets, in paving, :'Â¦ lighting
and sewering and less Into the salaries of high
priced deputies and fancy-figured â¢ experts; if
ten . dollars of salaries were not required for
one dollar of improvements; it would be a dis
tinct municipal advantage if the city would
sweep its own streets with its own machines
instead of giving enormous profits to contrac
tors, who sometime*. It Is charged, receive pay
for work which is not . done and who do not
pay adequate wages for the work < which is
done. It would not.be a bad idea to have a
municipal paving plant Private corporations
with, work of far â¢ less magnitude ' find â¢ no . dif
ficulty In doing It cheaply and well, with- thSf
own . f orees. It would also be . a distinct mu-'
nicipal benefit If Civil Service Commissioners

Euch methods certainly do not advance | the
efficiency of the department. These sugges
tions are all in the line of bettering the condi
tions of the individual and of caring, for the
rights of the Individual man. The happiness
and contentment of the individual is the basis
of the prosperity of the state.' It is the same
principle which led me to. champion the cause
of the laboring man in the recent political con
test and to accept the nomination which I has
now brought me here to address you as Mayor
of " San IVancisco. - I am opposed to utilizing
any department of the city government for po
litical or partisan .'purposes and to using the
money of the city for the payment of salaries
to unnecessary ornamental clerks for the sup
port of a political machine." . It will be a' great
municipal betterment if the - business of the
city could be conducted on principles'of-tfusl
ness economy, as each one of us would conduct
his own business. â¢ . -"<â¢-. â¢ : â¢Â¦

I > believe the members of the Fire Depart
ment should be given a "day off" once in
every ten and a'. week or two annually. for va
cation. They are < now obliged to remain the
year round twenty-four hours per day at their
houses. Too constant strain has not achieved,
the' best 'eventual results. I believe the mem
bers of the Police Department should have the
hours of their toil lessened. . .Twelve hours, In
my Judgment, is too much for the best results.
An. eight-hour day ought to be enough. , . -.
For example, I should consider it a matter of
great public ' advantage : if ; at least once a
week for. ttoe- benefit of '.the overworked mothers
and children, -of- the. city, we could provide at
the city" r. expense- opeli air concerts in a few
of our public squares. I would strongly favor
the erection in Golden Gate Park of a perma
nent building for the purposes of the Park
museum, and would gladly assist in making an
extra ' appropriation for that purpose.' Th^
advantages of collections of such objects as are
contained in our present young museum, for
education and the development of learning and
of -art are recognized the world over. They
cannot be too safely, too expansively housed.
The acquisition of the Geary Street Railroad
as an experiment in municipal 'management "of
public utilities and the ultimate, acquisition of
other utilities are also - in the line of great
municipal betterments. 3 I ' believe- one of my.
erstwhile journalistic critics has Â¦ found fault
with one of my former utterances in this : re
gard-.' I said -that "many, men X>f .experience >
who have given great thought to these ques
tions view with much, doubt the practicability

t:uc, and I have . recently examined .lnto^ the
matter very thoughtfully and find my' state
ment confirmed; but the people of- San" Fran*

San Francisco in this regard and I promise to
carry out- the purpose to the extent of : my
ability in a practical and businesslike ' way.

I should like to see the harbor front under
municipal control, and its 'management put on
a good, practical business' basis, with compe

vor decidedly the. establishment of the prin
ciple that goods of home manufacture should
be givun preference . In all supplies for public
institutions. This I believe to be in' the inter

the workingmen of this city, who pay- our taxes
and support our local government,' as 'against
foreign and external manufactures , and : mer
chants who take, their, profits hence and con

We have done too much fighting in this town.
Capital not only contends with labor and labor
with capital, but capital fights capital arid'la
bor oft strives against itself. Our friends, the
newspapers, sometimes fight capital,' and some
times nght- labor. They frequently flght one
another, and during.- pqlitical -times they" all
fight some of us who may happen to run for
Mayor. But seriously, we waste too much en
ergy against one another, when, by combining
forces, we could flght the world,' in commerce.
In industry, in manufactures, in. finance.' If
we were animated by an intelligent and con
certed purpose and would all put bur ' shoulders
to one wheel, instead of each devoting himself
to his seoarate wheel, and running in oppo
site directions; if we, to use the language of
the .day, would not let our own separate and
peculiar little wheels run us. â¢ = ' â¢â¢'

the certainty of Increased trade with South and
Central America, with the possibilities of the
Isthmian canal, with the great manufacturing
and industrial possibilities opened up by the
discovery at hand, in the vast oil beds of thu

Does Not Disappoint,
Tha New , Discovery for Catarrh Seems to
-Possess RenarkaWe Merit.
. A .new- catarrh' -cure; has recently ap-
peared which so far as tested has been
remarkably successful In curing all forma
of catarrh, whether In the head, throat*'
bronchial tubes or in stomach and liver.
The remedy is in tablet form, pleasant,
and convenient to take, and no - special
secrecy is maintained as to what it con-
tains, the tablet being a scientific com-
bination of Blood root. Red gum and sim-
ilar valuable and harmless antiseptics.
The safe and effective catarrh cure may
be found at any drug- store under the
name of Stoart's Catarrh Tablets.
Whether the catarrh is located In the
nose, throat, bronchial tubes or stomach.
th6 v tablets seem to act with equal suc-
cess, removing the stuffy feeling to head
and nose, clearing the mucous membrane
of throat and trachea from catarrhal se-
cretions, which cause the tickling, cough-
ing, hawking and gagging so annoying to
every catarrh sufferer. " â¢Â¦ * :
Nasal catarrh 'generally leads to -ulcera-
tion.-ln some cases to such an extent as
to destroy the nose entirely and in many
old cases of catarrh the bones of the head
become diseased. Nasal catarrh grad-
ually extends to the throat and bronchial
tubes "and very often to the stomach,
causing that very obstinate trouble, ca-
tarrh of the stomach. â¢
Catarrh is a systemic poison, inherent
In the blood, and â¢ local washes, douche*,
salves, inhalers and" sprays can- have no
effect on the real cause of the disease.
An internal remedy which acts upon the
blood is the only rational treatment " and
Stuart's CatarTh Tablets is the safest of
all Internal remedies, as well as the most
convenient and satisfactory from a med-
ical standpoint. '
Dr. Eaton recently stated that he had
successfully used . Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets in old chronic cases, even where ul-
. ceration had extended so far -as to de-
stroy the septum of the nose. He says:
VI am pleasantly surprised almost every !
day by the excellent results from Stuarf'a
Catarrh .Tablets. It Is remarkable how
effectually, they remove the excessive se-
< cretion and bring about a healthy con-
dition of the mucous membranes of the
nose, throat and stomucn."
' AH druggists sell complete treatment of
the Tablets -at 50 cents and a little book
giving the symptoms and causes of thV
various forms of catarrh "will be mailed
free by addressing F. A. Stuart Co., Ma--
i shall, Mich. > . '''liHIIIIIHiBWolIWi

- ' '-MiTWWlllir - . - .. ".The vote was then taken by roll call on
the adoption of the resolution thanking
Governor Gage. The resolution was adopt
ed by a vote of 7997 for and 3800 against.
Owing to the by-laws of the State Federa
tion allowing delegates present to' vote
the full strength of the, unions they rep
resented the resolution prevailed, though
the majority of the delegates present wÂ«re
opposed to its adoption.
The appointments made by Mayor
Schmitz of San Francisco caused consider
able disappointment in the hearts of many
of the delegates. It is safe to say that
had the delegates known yesterday the
names of Schmitz's appointees the new
President Rodgers appointed a sergeant
at-arms, and Andy Porter of the Vallejo
Labor Council was selected to maintain
order. Porter threatened that if dele
gates did not behave as gentlemen he
would eject them from the hall. A vote
was then taken on the amendment to
send the resolution to the City Front
Federation and for that body to thank
Governor Gage if it desired. The vote
was recorded by unions, those present
voting the entire representation of their
unions. The roll was called for and re
sulted in the defeat of the amendment
by 9907 noes and 29â¬9 ayes.
Zant of the Carpenters' Union of San
Francisco made a long speech In fa'vor of
the resolution of thanks to Gbge, and
when some delegates wanted to 'close the
debate by moving the previous
there was an uproar in the half:
Westoby then told of how Gage had
single-handed ended the strike and won
2. victory for the labor unions. He com
mended the Governor for not having
called out the National Guard, and was
frequently interrupted in his eulogy of
the chief executive of the State.
"An attack has been made on the City
Front Federation. We went out on strike
when we had no grievance. We went out
to help the teamsters and we went back
when the teamsters were reinstated.
There was no secrecy over the settlement
of the strike. The members of the com
mittee had every knowledge when the
meeting was to take place. The Em
ployers' Association asked the Governor
not to make the terms of settlement pub
lic, but they were afterward given to
the newspapers."
T. Westoby of the San Francisco City
Front Federation was then given the
floor. He said:
Defends the Federation.
Delegate A- Doland of the Porters' and
Packers' Union of San Francisco opposed
the resolution and said that there had
been no settlement of the strike and no
thanks were due to Governor Gage.
Fifty delegates were on their feet try
ing to secure recognition from the chair,
and ' President Rodgers had to wield his
gavel for some time before order was re
stored.
,' Ga Jl' e asked the union men on strike,"
said Grubb "to go back to work with
scabs. He brought about a settlement
of the strike by coercion, and you who
support this know it. The
settlement was made in secret and was a
put-up job by the City Front Federation,
for it was ait over before many of the
members of the committee arrived. What
were Gage's terms of settlement? He
told us to go back to work 'or out comes
the militia." " .
Samuel Grubb of the Hot Water and
Steam Fitters' Union of San Francisco
optained the floor and severely criticized
Governor Gage and his supporters in the
convention.
Another scene cf disorder greeted the
end of Macarthur's speech, dozens of
delegates shouting, "This is no political
meeting."
W hen order was restored Macarthur
resumed his speech and declared that
,"*e people of California expect us to
thank Governor Gage, and if we take no
steps in that direction they will say we
are controlled by the Governor's politi
cal opponents." p
r,Â« Tnl . s resolution." said Macarthur, "has
no political influence and there was no
secrecy in the. terms of the settlement of
wtat t wfri w tt i^râ¢ lu " e to thank ? ase '
Loud cries greeted Macarthur at this
point, some delegates shouting, "We don't
care what Gage thinks," while others
wanted to know "What Job are you look-
George Auberdine of the Barbers' Union
of San Francisco opposed the resolution
and thought that Governor Gage had sim
ply done his duty "if he did anything at
all to end the strike. This resolution,"
said Auberdine. "is a political advertise
ment for Governor Gage and should be
voted down."
Chairman Macarthur of the committee
on resolutions and a member of the Sail
ors Lnion of San Francisco defended the
resolution. He declared that Gage was
"5.2? Â°. ne man in the State -to end the
strike and that he had "refused to bow
down before the influence of the Employ
ers Association of San Francisco and call
out the National Guard to shoot us
down.
Debate on the Resolution*
eration did not then adopt a vote of thanks
to Gage because it was afraid to do so. Now
It comes here and wants outside unions to do
so. If the City Front Federation wants to
thank Governor Gage It,' can do so. but this
convention should not pnt Itself on record in
that direction.
VALiI>EJO Jan. 8.â The morning ses
sion of the third day of the State
Federation of Labor Convention
witnessed a split of delegates
upon a political rock.
The convention members were late In
gathering at Samoset Hall. On reconven
ing after a short recess President Rodgers
called for reports from the committee on
resolutions and Chairman Macarthur of
the committee reported that he and his
associates favored a resolution thanking
Governor Gage for his services In the set
tlement of the recent strike in Sfci Fran
cisco. The 'resolution had been sent up
by John Bell of the Pacific Coast Marine
Firemen's Union and was the cause of
lively debate before it was adopted. The
xesolution was as follows:
Whereas, The sefjement of the etrike cf
the City Front Federation of Ean Francisco
was brought about by the Governor of Cali
fornia, the Hon. Henry T. Gage; be it
Resolved. By the sonventlon of the Califor
nia State Federation of Labor, in meeting as
sembled, that we tsnder our most heartfelt
thanks to the Governor of our State lor tlie
cervices rendered to the organized workinpnen
of this State; for his eminently fair and un
biased attitude during that industrial struggle,
and in its final adjustment; and. be it further
Resolved. That a copy of this resolution be
forwarded to the HoiÂ»- Henry T. Gage.
Delegate T. Reardon of the Iron Trades
Council made a vigorous protest against
the adoption of the resolution and moved
to amend that the City Front Federation
give its thanks to Governor Gage if It so
.desired. He said further:
It was not Phelan'8 crowd but the State
police that clubbed iJie strikers on the. water
front. It was the i:tate police that kept us
moving along and why Ehould wo be called
upon to thank Gage Tor the so-called settle
ment of the strike? There are hundreds of
r men unable .to get work on the water front
I : o-day, and "scabs' 1 are being protected by
the State pollc*. <
What kind of a settlement was made by the
City Front Federation and Governor Gage?
The matter was settled in secret. "Why are
fences to be found to-day on the State wharves?
They are maintained there by Gage to protect
the "scabs." Thes<Â» resolutions Ehould be
voted down. I have a copy of the minutes of
the secret meeting hÂ«dd between the City Front
Federation and Governor Gage when they
claimed to have settled the strike. The fed-

"When I first wrote von I had been to three
different doctors and two of them said I would
never get better without going to the hospital
for aa operation," writes Mrs. Selma Erickson,
of 496 Rice Street, St. Paul. Minn. Â«Was not
able to do anything. If I would get up and walk
to the kitchen and back I would have to lie in I
bed for a day or sometimes two days. Now I
have used six bottles of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Pre-
scription and six of the { Golden Medical Discov-
ery.' and the result is just wonderful. I was so
nervous I had to have some one by my side all j
the time even in day time, and I could hardly
cat anything. I took treatment from a doctor
twice a week, and every time I would go there I
felt so sick, but since i'quit all the doctors and
began taking your medicines I gained right
along. > I weighed 125 pounds, when I began
taking your medicines (in August) and now
I am up to my usual weight 165. I am as well
and feel as good as ever."

of a miracle could save my little
daughter from an untimely
death," says City Marshall A.
H. Malcolm, of Cherokee, Kan.
"When two years old she was
taken with stomach and bowel
trouble and despite the efforts
of the best physicians we could
procure, she grew gradually
worse and was pronounced in-
curable. A friend advised .
Mues* Nervine
and after giving it a few days
she began to improve and final-
ly fully recovered. She is now
past five yesrs of age and the
very picture of health."

to" be Eastern men, as they are strangers
here. In Button's , room Â¦ in the Grand Ho

a lot of "strippers" used in playing a

Chief of. Police Wittman, will be heard

as the dealer. Sutton confirmed Lane's
statement that he wanted to fleece the
owners of the game, as they had treated
him unfairly. Miller then consented to
join in the scheme..' Sutton agreed .to
give the signal by which the last - turn

had lost U500, which was all the money
he had with him. Lane called upon Miller
a few days later and suggested that he
should try the experiment again, as luck
sermed to have been against them, on the
other occasion. Lane said he would put
up $2000 and If Miller could put up $3000
they would be sure to break the bank.
Miller appeared to consent and then noti

been robbed. It was arranged that- the

to be made Tuesday night, but something
happened to disarrange their plans. â¢ .

"The first proposition; to lynch ; these
men was made by Jim Brown on, Tuesday,
morning near Myers" hotel.; Brown said'
that it seemed that the law -was not going
to do anything, and- the citizens ought to
act. He asked me if I would Join them,"
andl. replied that -I : would.- I met Jerve
Krisge in 'Trowbridge's store to arrange
about the hanging of the five men. The
meeting took place' on Wednesday, and
Jim Brown.' Judge Myers and E. S. Trow
bridge were ' present. > Brown and . Myers
were picking out the ropes' with which to
hang the men. . They told me to come i in,
and asked me. If I believed the ropes wen;
big- enough.' Judge Myers -said that he
this witness being allowed to testify. The
court " ordered the prisoner to sit down
and informed him that he would be heard
through his counsel. . . \
Hutton testified that he last saw Calvin
Hall, Frank and James Hall, Daniel Yan
tis and Martin Wilson on May 31.
At this ' point Raker, who had slipped
back into'the courtroom,' started. to make
an objection. He was taken from. .. the
courtroom. Twice -he returned and twice
he -was ejected. He threatened to sue
Sheriff Street for false Imprisonment.
The witness then resumed his testimony.
He said that he saw the prisoners in My
ers' hotel. On the morning of May 31 he
participated with others in the banging of
the five -men. ... Â¦
Here- the witness was f" stopped Â¦ toy . the
interference of Raker, who had again
taken his seat in defiance of the court.
Post here objected to , the statements by
Raker, and said that if the court was
not able to protect itself â¢ he - wanted : to'
know It. He did not consider Raker's con- Â¦Â¦
tlnued objections were proper â¢ matter to
go before this Jury. Post, who could not
conceal his indignation, said that he had
never been before in any courtroom when
the, ethics of the legal profession were so
totally laid aside. >. â¢-Â¦Â¦- ,Â»Â¦-_Â¦Â¦--Â¦ Â«

3 game in a room on the fifth
floor of the Palace Hotel last
Thursday night and lost $1500. He no

men Hurd and Mulcahey arrested
William P. Carroll, familiarly known
as "Patsy" Carroll; Walter J. Lane.
Edward Sutton and Charles Stick
ney In room 304 of the Palace Hotel. A
complete faro layout was seized. Miller
subsequently swore to a complaint before
Judge Cabaniss charging: the four men
Â¦with grand larceny. They were booked
on the charee and also on a. charge of
visiting a, room containing gambling in
struments.
Miller, about two weeks ago answered
an advertisement in a morning- paper
which set forth that . a business man
worth $50,000 wanted an immediate loan
of $3000, -for which he would be willing tÂ«
pay $12,500 in a short time. Through this
advertisement Miller met Lane. After
talking for some time on the "business
proposition," Lane frankly admitted that
his scheme was to break a faro -bank. He
eaid the dealer would Join him" In the
scheme, as he had been 'unfairly treated
by the owners of the game.' Miller did
not take kindly to the proposition at first-
Lane, who was to go shares with him.

controversy. The- witness -was asked
where he expected to . make his future

convey to the mind of. the. witness; that

he waa approached - by .James F. Braid,

paper, who told him that for a cash con
sideration he could obtain the answers to
the examination, questions. 1 Lawson- on
Monday, evening entered into -a deal
whereby answers purporting to : be the
correct ones were handed to him.
Lawson sat - up all night copying the
answers and yesterday morning came to
Tacoma and began the examination. . He
pretended to be writing the answers to
the. Questions and at an opportune mo
ment pulled out his written copy of the
answers, from his pocket 'and, handed
them In. a About this time he was given
a special delivery letter signed '.' Wilson;

been notified of. the sale of the questions
and that he must -leave the examination

and he left. At 2 o'clock he went back to
continue the examination, but was re
fused .by Dr. Coe of Seattle, because not

Wilson would meet him last evening at a

ing to recover his money. â¢ Â¦'Â¦â¢.. Â¦
James F. Braid of . the . Seattle Times
frankly admits his connection, with the
affair, but claims he was merely, acting
the part of a. friend to Lawson, who had
advertised heavily in his paper. , Braid
claims he acted as go-between for Law
son and Dr. J. G. Stewart, of- Seattle.
Stewart also admits his connection and
claims he acted as go-between . for Braid

fore the barrier was released ' several of !

Ransch, "astride the first choice, who got
away behind a bunch of four or five. The

making a name on the turf. -
Favorite made a standoff, taking three
and losing a like number races. The
usual large crowd viewed the sport, wnicn
was far above the average and thoroughly
enjoyed. - Â¦ ,
Unquestionably the best perfomance of
the . afternoon was that of Walter Jen
nings' Lapidus. carrying 101 pounds. In the
Shell Mound handicap for three-year-olds,
at a mile. Shaping out the pace from the
time Jake Holtman sent the five -starters
away, Lapidus never gazed at anything
ahead of him but the atmosphere and run
past the judges' stand two lengths ahead
of the favorite, Waterscratch, in 1:39%.

Dr. Scharff, a 9 to 5 favorite in the ring,
took the opening sprint In a hard drive
from The "Weaver and Prestano. John
Peters, the Schorr entry, ' led into the
stretch and then died away. Sol Lichen
stein, a well backed one,- ran as if short.
Sir Tom Tiddler, a 60 to 1 shot, played to
15, was cut off at . the start and never
showed prominently.
But a nose separated the Duke of York
II and Finch at the flnieh of the mile and
a quarter hurdle handicap. Foucon, on
Finch, took all the obstacles in front and'
over â¢ the ; last' hurdle looked a winner.
Mattier now went to work on the Duke
and in a hair-raising finish was awarded
the verdict. Duffy, astride Sam Green,
nearly became unseated taking the last
jump and then finished a close third.' Both
the winner and place horse closed, equal
favorites in the ring. .: ' .,
. The Montana â¢ contingent made quite a
clean-up over the win of the fourth event,
a sii-furlong sprint, by, Sea Queen. The
odds against the Idaho-bred mare were
hammered down from 6 to 3%, and well
rated by Mounce, she won by less than
a/length from Maresa. School for Scan
dal, the favorite, lacked her usual supply
of speed, ending up an Indifferent third.
- In the ' concluding mile and a furlong
selling affair the horses ran close to form.
Diomed, the favorite, got away from the
barrier none too well, but' Jackson
threaded his way through and around the
bunch, downing Bragg a head-on the wire.'

third.

CANCER
Sufferers from 'this- horrible malady!
nearly always inlierititâ not necessariJv
from the parents, but may be from some
remote ancestor, for Cancer often runs;
through several generati6nÂ£ This deadly;
poison 2nay lay dormant in the' blood' for
years, or until you reach middle life, then
the first little sore or nicer makes its ap-
pearance â -or a swollen gland in the
oreast, or 6ome other part of the body,
gives the first -warning. ' y.' .
To cure Cancer thoroughly and perma-
nently all the poisonous \irus must be
eliminated from the bloodâ every vestage
of it driven out.- This S- S. S. does, and
is the only medicine that can reach deep-
seated, obstinate blood troubles like this.
When all the poison has been forced out
of the system the Cancer heals, and the
disease never returns.
Cancer begins often in a small way, as the
following letter from Mrs. Shirer shows :

performed their duties. .
During .'the last two years the Mayor , and
Supervisors have let contracts ' for , supplying
the several departments, with materials, and it
is noteworthy that .the merchants have with
entire confidence entered into competition. : that
the awards have been made to the lowest bid
ders, and all bills have been promptly paid.
Gas rates .. have been ' materially reduced, but
competition has, . during the ' year, forced rates
in some Instances almost to the cost of produc
tion. - The same is true of electric light.' .The
illumination of 'the streets by the introduction
of lamps with ."VVelsbach . burners shows metro
politan progress. After a patient Investigation
a valuation of approximately $23, 000,000 was.
placed upon the property of the Spring Valley
Water Works used in supplying the city with
water, and after allowing operating: expenses'
and taxes a rate was fixed for public and pri
vate. consumption which was designed to.net
the company â¢ 5 per cent upon this valuation.
Heretofore it was customary to allow the.com-;
pany $60 a year for. each hydrant, which ag
gregated $223,000. - By the method approved by
the courts and adopted for the first time last
February by the Supervisors, the value of ftie
company's - property was first .determined < and
upon it an agreed percentage allowed. Then,
on that basis, it was found that the contribu
tion of the water rate payers would be ap
proximately $140,000 less this year than last
year, and the. question before the Supervisors
was whether to reduce the general rates by that
amount or to give the city in hydrant rates the
whole benefit of the reduction. It adopted the
latter plan, and fixed a lump sum, $80,000, in
stead of a per hydrant rate for that service.
This, also, by saving it from the hydrant bills.
Rave the city in addition to the surplus,.$140,
000 within the dollar limit for public improve
ments. The water company has not â¢ collected
any part of this hydrant rate during the fiscal
year beginning last 'July, but is disputing the
validity of the water order in the courts.- It
would appear that in any event it cannot re
ceive more than the $80,000 appropriated this
year : in : the budget, ' for this Is . the limit of
expenditure, but it is endeavoring to establish
a ' precedent : for future years, and hence the

The proceedings before the Commission
ers that preceded the two orders in the
oil rate case, on the original and second
hearings, were given great publicity in
the daily newspapers and the fact was
Trade evident that the testimony was long
and comprehensive. The complaint that
led to the proceedings was filed by John
La Blanc on April 16, 1901. The first hear
ing began on August 1. M01, and contin
ued seven days, with two sessions each
day. The witnesses were W. H. Allen,
W. A. Bissell, B. F. Brooks. Edward
Chambers. Rufus C. Emory. Frank A.
Garbett, John Lu Howard, Julius Krutt
pchnitt. John La Blanc. John Martin.

Wendling. The case was submitted to the
"What is the Board of Railroad Com
missioners for?"â is asked on every side.
With this is coupled the opinion that If
the board has nc standing of value to the
public it will be well to abolieh it and go
rack to the Legislature to regulate rates
at the legislative sessions.
The fa.ct is also pointed out that if the
Board of Railroad Commissioners has no
power to regulats rates on oil, neither has
it the power to effectively fix rates on
flour, wheat or any other commodity.
Rates fixed by the Comissioners have
been considered to be forcible unless it
couia be clearly shown that they would
deprive the owners of the transportation
lines of their property, by compelling
them to fio business at a loss.
Board Seems Powerless.
reasonable and they therefore fixed maxi
mum charges. Attorneys for the South
ern Pacinc Company thereupon appeared
before Judge Dunne, who, without taking
any testimony, granted the temporary or
der that was asked for to prevent the
Â¦Commissioners from putting their order
Into effect and assigned the case for bear
ing tc Judge Hebbard- The rejoicing of
the oil men, who together have in the
aggregate several millions of dollars in
vested in the oi:. industry and who had
seen in the action of the Railroad Com
missioners a measure of relief, was thus
turned to Borrow and indignation.
In the proceedings were involvedÂ» the
possibility of tying up the rates for a
long period without court trial, possibly
until the Railroad Commission could be
made to' take on an aspect more favor
able to the railroad company by a change
in Its personnel. The proceedings com
menced might te made to. engage suc
cessively the Superior and Supreme courts
of Uiis State ani the Supreme Court of
the United States on appeal, thus con
suming a long pÂ«riod of time.
"What good is the commission to the
State" â Is angrily asked by the oil men â
"if its orders can be practically set aside
by any complaisant Judge, without hear
ing, in this vray?"
The first blow was given when Presid
ing Judge Dunne acted. The Board of
.Railroad Commissioners, after sitting
many days and taking testimony from a
email army of witnesses, found that the
charges for moving oil Irom the San Joa
quin Valley to San Francisco were un-
Judge Dunne Acts First.
The oil producers of the Stato and the
State Beard cf R.ailroad Commissioners
are aghast at thu proceedings of the past
lew days in the State and Federal courts
in connection with the nullifying of the
ruling by which the Commissioners re;
reduced the reight rates for moving oil
from Bakersneld and other points in the
San Joaquin Valley to San Francisco.
The Southern Pacific Company recently
secured a temporary restraining order
irom the State courts through the action
cf Presiding Judije Dunne of the Superior
Court- Judge Morrow, In the Federal
Court, has made an order, upon applica
tion of the Santa Fe Railroad, restrain
ing the Railroad Commissioners from put
ting their rates into effect and set a day
for showing cause why the' temporary or
der fchould not be made perpetual. The
effect Is that the work of the Commis
eion, created urder the constitution of
California, for the express purpose of
regulating rates to be charged by trans
portation lines in this State, is suspended.
The Santa Fe Company has always added
to its annual rep art to the Railroad Com
missioners a statement that, being a for
eign corporation and doing business In
several States, it was not subject to regu
lation by a State commission. ,â¢ : r

Value of a Constitutional
Board Is Debated
With Vigor.
Railroad Commissioner C." S. Laumeis
ter and Secretary W. T. Sesnon were
served with an order of the United States
Circuit Court yesterday restraining the
Board of Railroad Commissioners from
enforcing the oil rate adopted December
3. They immediately, telegraphed Com
missioners Edson and Blackstock notify
ing them of the service . of the papers.
Replies were received from both Com
missioners to .the effect that- they will be
in the city to-day. The board will then
decide upon what action they will take
in the matter.
In October a petition for a rehearing
was granted, the Southern " Pacific and
the Santa Fe both making application for
it- On November ."12 the taking of testi
mony was again begun. The witnesses
were Walter C. Beatie. W. A. Bissell,
Senator R. N. Bulla. Frank A. Garbett,
J. A. Graves. George L. Hoxie, Thomas
Hughes, W. A. Jacobs, Livingston Jenks,

son, T. L.. Reid, Timothy Spellacy, A. J.
Samuel, W. A. Worthington and Edward
Strasbilrg. The taking of testimony pro
ceeded five days, ending November 30.
The order establishing the rates which
the railroads are. now striving to tie up
by injunction was made December. 2, 1901.
Father Smith of the Church of St. Vin
cent de Paul and Chaylaih WalkleyQf
Grace Church, both 'Chaplains of the Fire
Department. ' crawled into the wrecked
coach over the hot boiler, of the demol
ished White Plains locomotive and found
two girls in the middle of the last car
They were Miss Rice and Miss Scott of
New Rochelle. One lay on top of the
other, the one underneath held by wreck
age, which pinned her body down below
the waist. One leg was crushed. The dead
body of a man. which was also â¢ pinned
fast by the wreckage, lay across the chest
of the other and held her down.
Commissioners on September 4 and wai
taken under advisement until October 8.
On the last. Earned date the order was
made, reducing the rate from 42 cents to
37 8-10 cents per barrel. - ' ' '
Ladders were run down the tunnel air
shafts and firemen and police attacked the
debris with ropes and axes. Passengers
already had rallied and were trying to re
lease those imprisoned in . the debris.
Lights were extinguished and from the
wreckage and darkness came the cries of
the injured and calls for- assistance by
those who escaped. Within a few minutes
the work of rescue, marked by . heroism
and sacrifice, began. Alarms that brought
every available ambulance In the citj? the
police reserves of five precincts and the
riremen of the central district of Man
hattan, were sounded at once. With
police, firemen and surgeons came a score
of -volunteer physicians and half a dozen
clergymen.

It was a rear-end collision between the
South Xorwalk local that ran over on the
New York, New Haven and Hartford road
and was halted by block signals at the
southern entrance of the tunnel, and a
White Plains local that came by the Har
lem branch of the New York Central. ; The
wreck occurred at 8:17 a. m., at which
hour the trains were crowded by suburban
ites. Most of the deaths, injury and dam
age were caused by the engine of. the
White Plains train, which plunged /into
the rear car of the motionless train and
was driven through to the middle of [ the
car, smashing the seats and splitting the
sides as it moved forward. The victims
either were mangled In the mass of wreck
age carried with the pilot, crushed in the
space between the boiler and car sides or
scalded by 'steam Â¦ which came hissing
from broken pipes and cylinders. The en
gine in its final plunge of forty feet car
ried the rear car forward and sent twisted
iron, broken timbers and splinters crash

this government is a valid and justifiable principle of;

punishable by imprisonment for not more than fifty

A number of people whose Americanism is a thin
veneer assumed for the purpose of getting all tlie
protection of this government while doing its prin
ciples as much harm as possible indulged in the
sneer that the three assassins of our Presidents were
native born. That is true. 4 Booth, Guiteau and
Czolgosz were all Americans" of the second genera
tion. But anarchy is not indigenous. It is an exotic,
imported like many other principles that are de-,
stru:tive of government and inimical to American,
institutions.
One merit of the Jenkins bill is that indeals im-.
partially with the devotees of " an alien principle,
whether native or immigrant. It is not in the Â¦Amer
ican nature, as a native. principle, to turn to assassi
nation for the purpose of advancing .any civil pol
icy. Patience is the characteristic of our, people in
seeking any reform. It is fixed in their habit to wait
for the ballot, and to submit loyally when their ideas
are rejected at the polls.
It is not germane to. quote the_C.ivil War as proof;

intent of the Federal constitution, and high author-'
ity was insisted upon in support Â¦ of eath of the -rival
views. It was an issue of constitutional construction,
which the courts could not. settle, and it was appealed.
to arms and fought out, . man "fashion. The. result
settled forever the nature of the Federal constitution,
and gave to every American citizen a personal inter
est in the maintenance of the system which, it estab
lished.
Since that settlement there has grown up a school,
based on a foreign idea, that the system is wrong
and violence against it is justifiable. This school had
its principles voiced by the newspapers, which, in
text and graphically, represented . the President as.
thrDwing a stone to the people when they asked for
bread, and as saying to them, 'The . Trust is king,
anc the king can do no wrong."
This bill, while not interfering with : , the freedom
of speech or of the press, takes Federal judicial cog-;
nizance of the methods of these propagandists, and if
it become a* law they will find it to' their interest ta
cease defamation that leads to violence; â¢

THE bill introduced into the House by Mr.
Jenkins of Wisconsin seems to deal with an
archy in the simplest and most natural form.
It makes an assault vpon the President, Vice Presi

death, whether such assault be fatal or not. The

aid, abet or advise such assault, such aid being in the

Â¦ From that point the argument of the Secretary !
Was \ directed [ against ; the popular prejudice . against
banks. He pointed out that" there is no more danger,
in" leaving; the control ; of currency in the hands of
bankers, than there As in leaving .to railroad compa
nies tlie tontrol v of the number' of cars needed for
transportation." He went on to say: "When a
Western bank now needs more . 'circulation, rhore
cash, it rediscounts its commercial t paper and is,
campelled to' redeem . it at a: given ', date and .' pay a
much higher- rate. Let the banks be permitted to
increase their circulation when needed, to be % retired :
as soon as the demand, for, it ceases, and keep ever -
present the inducement to retire it when not needed,
and elasticity is secured."
In concluding the subject Â¦ the Secretary ' said : "I
repeat that currency based on assets contains,' in my
judgment, no element of . â¢ darfger except popular ,
prejudice. /This will vanish as the question is dis
cussed_and explained by those who" make a study of ,
it. L ; The would be in no worse condition
than now. Whenever a, bank fails the assignee finds
its bankable commercial paper; hypothecated. In
other, words, it has increased its circulation by send- ?
ing, its. assets to some other; bank and borrowing
circulation : at a : high rate of interest, and it does this '
even after it ceases to be solvent. It certainly would
be.; no worse to allow a Goverpment issue 'Â¦. after
special- examination." .
In these statements we have the expression of a
conservative' statesman who does hot cross a stream â¢
until he comes to it. '-The only- objection -of the Sec
retary to asset currency is that of* the danger involved
in arousing a- popular prejudice abased- upon- ignor
ance. .He is convinced, however, that a campaign 'of
education will; remove that prejudice from the minds :
of ; intelligent nien. Fortunately the .; discussion : of.
financial issues- during the last six years has? done
much; to" mstruct the people; concerning r the tnie;
functions, of banks, and the ; old-time -prejudice is
well" nigh removed. The , very "â¢ conservatism of the â¢
Secretary upon the . subject will 'Â¦ go far toward over-,
coming such prejudice as remains.) It -appears,
therefore, that the appointment of Secretary Shaw to
the Treasury â¢ Department at this juncture is a? most
fortunate one. He will keep iti : : touch',. with i;the peo
ple-and be; one -of the foremost in the campaign] of
education to remove the ' popular prejudice which,
as he says, constitutes the ' only element of danger in
an :Â¦ elastic â¢currency based on assets.; '. V
In the course of his address the \ Secretary said : "I
have been Â¦ asked to say something 'â¢ on"' the subject
of. bank circulation based upon assets?; This is riot
an issue in politics, nor have we any legal; provision;
therefor. T shall therefore riot attempt to defend: it. >
I" am. willing,", however, to go on recordin favorof
an elastic 'and if I believed there was -no
other; way to; secure such L a- currency than by an
asset currency,- then I would.be in favor, of such is
sue."' In' another place he said: V. "I do'. not believe
it necessary to. resort to. asset banking in order to!
provide an elastic currency. I . recognize } a , public
prejudice akin to fear against'a currency based- on
assets/ and prejudice, so; long, as it exists, constitutes"
an element of danger .'even' when the 'thing itself
against which* the prejudice lies con^iins. no element
of danger." . Â¦â¢'^^-'M'-

St. Louis a hundred years ago^was the best known'
town in Louisiana, except New Orleans. It was first
known/as Laclede, the name of its founder. -The
people were French, used horses and two-wheeled
carts, most of their transportation being on pack
animals, and rude boats on. the riven George W.
Applegate of Applegate, Cal., says that when .his
grandfather, . a Kentucky immigrant, crossed the
river at St. Louis the people of that town saw the
first four-wheeled vehicles that were seen west of the
Mississippi. Their curiosity was. so great that they
followed the wagons out of town,, making bets that
the hind wheels would overtake the . . front Â¦ wheels,
which seemed natural to them, as the hind wheels
were larger! / " ' > '^ '
All .the advance ma'de since those simple and dis
tant days will be sRown in the great city that' has
grown out of Laclede's blockhouse. ''-â¢â¢'.
; The vast changes that 'have taken place since that
treaty . was made are brought before the .mind ' by.
Hon. J. Sterling Morton of Nebraska, who notes.;
that January i, 1805, Lewis and Clark, sent- out by
Jefferson to, explore, the northwest territory to '"Â¦ the
Columbia, were. housed in Fort Mandan, which they
had built for winter quarters; in latitude 47, arid dis
tant' sixteen hundred miles from the^ mouth of the
Missouri. . Mandan is now in North Dakota, near â¢
Bismarck. The; Dakotas, Minnesota, llowa, Neb-,
raska, Kansas and Arkansas .were then unsettled
territory, controlled by wild tribes. -; The. French fur;
hunters had made some settlements in Missouri,,
which had not yet been erected into a Territory nor.'
received its distinctive name. â¢''".
The New Year diversions of the explorers are en
tered in Lewis and Clark's journal to this effect: ;
"The^ New Year was welcomed by two shot'from the
swivel and a round of small arms. The weather was
cloudy, but moderate, the mercury ; at sunrise 18
above zero. In the morning we permitted sixteen
men with their music to go up to the first Indian vil
lage, where they delighted the. whole tribe with their'
dances, particularly with the movements of one
Frenchman, who danced on his head. In reftirn'thc
Indians presented the dancers with several buffalo
robes and quantities of corn."
Since the day that Frenchman danced on his head
progress has planted millions of people in the land
that was a wilderness, and its- century of history is
to be celebrated by the greatest exposition ever held
in the world.! With nearly $20,000,000 in hand, ex-
Governor. Francis and the {St.* Louis Exposition
Commission propose to eclipse all that has been and
to set a mark that will probably never; be passed.
THE purchase. of Louisiana is to be celebrated;
next year b.y_an. exposition. at St. Louis. .That
purchase, effected by Jefferson in treaty, with
| Bonaparte, was probably 'the greatest step taken in
ourTnajtiprral history since the Revolution. It secured
to us the control of .the Mississippi River and its
watershed; ; and advanced" our frontier to the mouth
of the Columbia. It is true that this was disputed
and Spain assumed to quitclaim Oregon, but Jef
ferson thought and' acted upon his conviction" that,
the treaty of Paris joined the mouths of the -two
great rivers under our flag.". - Â¦" '- Â¦

years ago . with - only a few hundred -' dollars
capital. â¢
This case Is the first of Its kind in Cali
fornia, but several have been success
fully maintained In Eastern States.
The firm further claims that in settling with
its creditors it was compelled to pay out mora
than 100 cents on the dollar, with tbe expen
ses added and sacrifices made. Nearly $50,000
indebtedness was borrowed money, but not
due.' This was paid in full.
The complaint alleges that on the date,
mentioned the firm had sufficient cash on
hand in . the bank* to pay all the checks
that were payable on that , date, but that
in. spite of that fact the bank refused to
honor checks of the store of the value of
about $3750, and by. such refusal impaired
the credit of the complainant and forced
its creditors to press their demands so
that the firm -was obliged to make an as
signment for the benefit of its creditors.
The firm avers that by the "unreasonable,
willful and malicious act of the. bank as
aforesaid" it has sustained damage to the
extent of $100,000 . in Ios3 of credit and
profits."
. On behalf of Barclay J. Smith, senior
member of the firm, Attorney Schlesinger
has made the following statement public
of what it Will attempt to prove:
At the time of the refusal of the bank to
pay checks the business amounted to $000,000
a year. The firm deposits to the banlc aver
aged about $2000 .a day for several years. It
is claimed that on the 29th day of January,
1900, the firm bad nearly $8000 to ita credit in
bank, as shown by the bank's passbook, and
that checks were drawn en that day amount
ing to about $3750. Af the same time tha
First National Bank held a note of Smiths'
Cash Store, given the day before, for $4000.
: The rote was not due and Smiths' Cash Store
was not asked to pay it. It is claimed- that
without any notice to the store, the First Na
tional Bank deducted from ita deDOsit the
amount of the note and declined to pay a large
number or checks issued by the store to the
i amount of $3750. The indebtedness of the store
at that time amounted to about $100,000. but
only a few thousand dollars of It was due, and
the assets of the concern far exceeded its lia
bilities. Owing. to the action of the bank, the
creditors became clamorous for : their money
and forced Smiths' Cash Store to assign. '
- 1 1 1Â« claimed that for several months tha
firm j was deprived of the ownership of its
business, during which time the store was In
; the hands of an assignee. The flrm succeeded,
Â¦ however, within the time, in paying, off . the
entire indebtedness by making large sacri
fices of goods. It is claimed that the concern
always enjoyed an excellent credit, always met
its obligations promptly, and it was solely out

- I am one of the survivors of : the Walla
Walla. I am now in the German Hospital and
have not >spoken to anyone about the disaster.
I have read many criticisms of the captain and
crew for not doing their duty In saving- life. As
a sailor I feel it ray duty to say something in
their behalf. I know that all survivors feel the
loss of their loved ones and their property, but
they. must not allow grievances to cloud their
reason." They should not judge too rashly. â¢ Â¦Â¦:
ft I was not on dsck when the collision occurred,
but soon after the Walla Walla was i struck.
The^ master and officers of the steamer did all
that could be done at that trying moment. They
behaved splendidly and deserve praise and not
criticism for their actions.
The inspectors will try to fix the blame
tfor the disaster. The officers .'and' crew
of the Max claim 'that their lights were
burning "'Â¦ and that they could see the
Walla Walla fifteen minutes before : the
collision. The lookout on the Walla Walla
claims that he i saw a light, but did not
see the bark until she was on top of the
steamer. Other members of the steamer's
crew claim that the Max .displayed no
lights.. .
.Captain C. F. Swan, one of the : oldest
navigators on this coast, who was on the
Walla Walla at the time of the collision,
speaks In. the highest praise of the offi
cers and crew of the steamer. He is now
a. patient at the ; German Hospital. ",: Ten
hours' exposure on a life'.raft and a dis
located knee prevent him attending the
investigation. ; He prepared the following
statement for The Call and will submit
one to the proper officials in order to stop
unnecessary criticism of Captain Hall and
his officers:
Frederick Henry,' representing the own^

All'thls comes from trying to pay my Just

Mr.- Bach,* senior member i of 'the firm,
said yesterday that ',he Â¦. was not surprised
at Â¦ the Â¦ suicide of . his partner: ; Eckenrotb !
'entered the office of the firm nearly thirty
years ; ago as office boy. He! displayed bo
much aptitude for the ; business- that he
was "promoted to the position of book- '
keeper, and finally,' upon \ the -retirement
of - Mr. . Meese, became- full â¢ partner. : A
year- or, two ago Mr. Bach says he began
to suspect shortages, but did not suspect
his partner-* ; until recently, when he ;or
dered . an Investigation of- the accounts of
the : flrm; ; y The investigation, 'Bach, claims,
I ehr.wed defalcations andthat the accounts

Â¦ Frank H. Eckenroth "Jr., "elder, son of
the; deceased, made the- following state
ment last evening:- Â¦
Having seen, a .statement' In - an .evening
paper alleged, to have come from John Bac*,
senior member of the firm of Bach, Meese &
Co., In which it was stated that my father was
short in his accounts and was subject to gam
bling, I have to make an emphatic denial- of
puch charges. â¢- My father, .as every one/ will
say who i knew him. was -neither a gambler
nor a drinking man, nor given to vice of any
description. He was- devotedly <- fond*, of - hi3
family and never, unless working at night, so
much -as went out for his own pleasure unless
attended by my mother Â¦ or. some member, of
the household. He was, as every one knows,
charitable even to a' fault. l No poor man could
approach him without havlng-hls wants grati
fied. The statement which I have referred to
I : cannot, nor can any member of my family
or -personal friends, understand. "My /.father
was an officer of Stanford Parlor, Native Sons,
for many years and recently resigned the treas
urership of that parlor, in which he was held In
highest esteem.y â¢ '. . i Â¦;: \ ;
AH hope for the safety of .the schooner
Reliance has been abandoned and it now
seems certain , that the little craft has
fallen victim to one of the sudden dan
gers of the deep. Â¦ The Reliance,- a vessel
of about sixty tons, left here forty-nine
days ago for 'Coqullle River and has
neither been seen nor heard, of since. She
should have made the trip In about ten
days or. two weeks at the outside. The
grave fears for her- safety yesterday - re
ceived confirmation in the report made
at Astoria by Captain Bailey of 'the tug
Tatoosh. He reports having, encountered
a few days ago a derelict schooner bot
tom up. This was on the north side of i
the channel and ; near No. 8 buoy. She j
appeared to be about sixty tons, was Cop- j
per painted and had a centerboard, but -.
no keel. All of her. spars were under:
water, except the main mast, which had '
broken off and was held up by the rig- 1
Sing. . This description exactly fits the
missing Reliance, and small hope is now
held out for the safety of Captain Olsen
and his crew of: five men. Captain Bailey
did all in his power to Investigate the
derelict, but the elements interfered. He
lowered a boat and made fast a line.
With the Intention of hauling: the wreck
Â«n to the sands. The line parted, how
ever, and before It could again be made
fast the wreck had been carried by the
ebb tide into rough water, where a boat
could not reach it. Captain Bailey says
the wreck must : have been floating for
some time, as the mast was badly chafed.
Supposed to Be Wreck-of R-sliance.
Broadway .wharf Is to be replaced be^,
fore it tumbles into the bay. The . Har
bor Commissioners yesterday -awarded
the contract for the new pier to tne Hy.de

tract for dredging the channel at Chan

Judge Kerrigan dismissed the contested
election cases of R. W. Roberts and John
J. Daughney yesterday for want of, prose
cution. '-"'. The cases were to have been
tried yesterday at a special session of the
courtâ The lawyers for the defeated can
didates asked for a continuance, but this
was refused, because section 1121 of the
Code of Civil Procedure provides that a
case set. for a special session must be
tried on the date set unless affidavits are
presented to the court showing cause for
a continuance. Judge â¢ Kerrigan declared
a recess until 2 p. m. to enable the attor
neys to secure the necessary documents.
At that hour. Attorney. Kierce, who repre-,
sents Roberts and Daughney, announced
that owing to theÂ»absence from town of
one Â¦ of , his Â¦: clients and his failure to find
the other he could â¢ not furnish the affida
vits. Judge Kerrigan then dismissed the
suits. BMriBBQBnPtMIHNBIsiVt

The Outlook for 1902.
The New Tork circular of Henry Clews
eaj-B :
"The outlook in 1902 is certainly satisfactory
and hopeful, but less bo than a year ago.
Prices of 1>oth stocks and commodities are very
high, so liigh as to materially check . buying
power ancl remove all basis for legitimate
epeculaticn. or anticipation of future wants.
The business situation is good, yet it is spotty
compared with the beginning of 1901. The
lion trade is still enjoying a most extraordi
nary boom and promises to continue ' In this
course for some time to come. Its chief basis
In the Cvxr.and from the railroads, which, as
explained in previous advices, are not only
overtaxed with the handling of freight, but
are passinjj through a process of reconstruction
involving lieavy orders for rails, bridges, â¢ cars
and Iccomatives that would be likely to con
tinue even should the rush of freight abate
somewhat. For some time to come the rail
roads will be obliged to spend- a large part of
their surp.us earnings in this direction, rather
than in increased dividends; and it is rare
good fortune for railroad managers that these
imperative changes can be paid for out of earn
ings rather than by isgue of new securities,
which would otherwise have been the case. Ex
perts say iJiat the end of the present activity in
Jreicht trcific is not yet in sight; that we are
in for several months' additional good busi
ness. We trust this will prove true, but we
are now at the time when a reduced corn
movement will be felt and the severe winter
promises to cause more or less interruption.
Outside of the iron trade there is no abnormal
activity a ad values often show a sagging
tendency. High prices have stimulated pro
duction ar d checked buying, so that some sort
of natural readjustment seems necessary. In
this cor.ntction it is Important to watch the
workings 3f the trust experiment. * Â«~*hese or
ganization!', exert a*powerful control t}\ r prices,
which if used In the same fashion as in cop
per will produce corresponding results. Those
who. control these trusts and have securities
which the? would like to sell may easily be
tempted to hold prices at artificial . levels, to
dam up the natural forces of supply and de
mand, until such schemes collapse fcom inher
ent unsourdness. The trust system .appears to
have worked very smoothly under prosperity,
and it will be interesting to watch its course
when the markets begin to meve in a down
ward direction, as they certainly will In due
i-tason. . There is a vast mass of these securi
ties in this market undigested, and they will
be the first to feel the effects of reaction.'
â¢â¢The immediate outlook for the market- is
hopeful. Easier money, which may be ex
pected in * few days, and the anticipated in
vestment demand will undoubtedly be used as
a bull argument. As a result we shall prob
ebly have a good trading market for a spell,
during wt.ich we should advise profit taking
upon all pronounced rallies."

naturally a disappointment, especially, ce the
three months showed successive declines down
to the estimate for 'December of less, than
$8,000,000. An increase of only about a million
dollars over the previous quarter was. consid
ered unsatisfactory, as that previous quarter
included the period of the costly strike and
reports of current trade have been enthusiastic
for some time past. The enormous absorption
of Union Pacific and its aggressive recovery to
104% from the early low level of ,101% was
effective In dissipating the uneasiness caused
by the proceeding against the Northern Securi-.
ties Company in the United States â¢ Supreme
Court. Owing to the wide-reaching importance
attached to this whole subject, the resilency of
this group of stocks had a notable sentimental
effect on the whole - market. There was no
news to explain the movement, unless It might
be due to & report that the Interstate Commerce
Commission had adjourned its proposed inquiry
into the affairs of the Northern Securities Com
pany until later In the month. The excuse
offered by the United State* Steel authorities
that car shortage and freight . blockades had
affected their earnings was taken as renewed
confirmation that the railroads had . all the
business they could handle. The speculators
used this as a favorable argument for the rally
in the railroads. Somewhat inconsistently labt
week's sharp decrease In gross earnings â¢ in
some of the soft coal carriers s was attributed
also to car shortage. Rock Island was strong
on the large net earnings for November. | The
movement, in sugar was. characteristic of an
annual meeting day. The rise to 124% was at
tributed to the -appeal by the' president of the
company for the abolition of the duty on raw
sugar. The seeming certainty that no gold
will go out this week, and the hope that next
week's probable outgo will be offset by receipts
of cash from other sources helped on the late
rally.-. The firmness oÂ£ Amalgamated Copper
and American Smelting wae due to reports of
a heavy export movement of copper.
The bond market was somewhat irregular,
but responded to the late strength of stocks.

I hope you will" describe the < true situation
to her Majesty, the Empress Dowager, and
persuade her to put the Manchurlan affair In
your hands, bo that I may negotiate with you
alone. . This, In my opinion. Is the only way to
prevent ' the .- province from falling into the
hands : of a* foreign' power. . Â¦Â¦â¢'â¢ -Â¦<-.-
It is for this reason that Russia insists on
keeping this lnriDortant territory under her
nominal control until China is strong - enough
to take it back. If we disregard the welfare
of China and evacuate Manchuria at the pres
ent moment I am sure that no sooner have our
troops left the place - than ' those of some : one
or another of. the foreign powers will step In
and make Â¦ permanent occupation. This state
ment. It is expected. ' will , be . a sufficient - ex
planation why we refuse to give up Manchuria
now.'.-:.. ;v .'â¢Â¦â¢'Â¦ '. â¢Â¦â¢ :-.' -. . ' , Â¦ Â¦ . ..;Â¦ ;.;Â¦-
But after careful consideration, we find that
it is not at all opportune for. us to do so now.
And' the reason is obvious, for China' is new
ly . defeated ' and : is . saddled with * the burden
â¢of unprecedented indemnity. It is not within
her power, to raise sufficient funds to organ
ize and maintain a strong army in Manchuria
to defend' It. But unless Manchuria Is strong
ly garrisoned it is impossible to prevent for-'
elgm powers from casting a greedy eye on the
province.- ' : "Â¦â¢â¢Â¦ . - .
As general peace has been restored and. the
court is about to return - to the old capital.
It appears' reasonable â¢ that ' we .- should hand
beck Manchuria to its proper owner .to quiet
the minds of those who are inclined to sus
pect that Russia Is aiming at absorbing and
annexing this important' territory. . ' .
. With reerard to - Manchuria. It is a place
where the present dynasty has had its origin.
How can the Chinese Government oermit a
number of wolves and tigers to intrude .into
this important province- of the Chinese Empe
ror? But we knew that unless we stepped for
ward China -would be -powerless against those
wolves andtigreis. â¢ We, â¢ therefore. madÂ» haste
in dispatching; a strong .army southward â¢ to
protect this province from being invaded by
the other powers, and our action In this mat
ter has had its desired effect, for by our
strenuous and prompt efforts . peace and order
have been gradually restored throughout Man
churia, and no foreign tftwer dared to . touch
the province. Thus the sovereignty of China
in ths province has been maintained.
We bave tried and done everything in. our
power to protect the interests of China, and
Jt Js for this that we have earned the im
p'.acable hatred of all tho other powers.
The late Li Hung Chang was a very far
sighted and able statesman, who had always
been Â¦ on friendly terms with us because he
knew that Russia' was the only true friend of
China. - Â¦
Unfortunately the Boxer disturbances broke
out last year and all the fore.ign powers took
advantage of the occasion to e'end their hostile
armies into China. Though we tried to re
frain from participating in the expedition In
vain, we labored most strenuously to persuade
the allied forces to evacuate Peking as soon
as . the legations had been relieved. Subse
quently, when the Japanese attempted to
snatch the power of policing the city or Peking
from the hands of the Chinese authorities, we
stood obstinately in their way and so their
unreas-onablwoU'-mpt was frustrated^ AVbvn
all the alHÂ«r powers joined together in dic
tating to China the punishments of those Chi
nese officials who were suspected by them . of
having countenanced: the' Boxers, we exerted
every effort to get as many officials exempted
from punishment as possible, in order to pro
tect the dignity pf your country. It is -need
less tp say that it was entirely due to , our
strong and persistent opposition that your Ex
cellency was not included in the list. â¢
As your Excellency is doubtless aware, the
territories of our two countries are in touch
with each other and among foreign countries
Russia is the nearest neighbor of China from
a geographical point of view. Everything that
affects the interests cf the one equally affects
those of the other. In consequence of this
Russia has always looked forward to the day
when China may be prosperous and powerful.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 8.â According to
advices from Kaifeng-fu by the Empress
of India, the Tung Wen Hupao publishes
a confidential, letter addressed to the
Grand Counselor, Yung Yu, by the Rus-*
sian Minister, M. Lessar, - immediately
after the death of the late LI Hung
Chang. The document Is Bald to have
been obtained from Japanese sources and
is as follows:
Steps are to be taken by â¢ the Â¦ board to
punish those whoare practicing medicine
without taking the precaution of â¢Â¦ secur
ing the credentials necessary. The board
decided to ask the State Board of Medi
cal Examiners to prosecute all Illegal
practitioners. â¢ - : '
The board also decided to take meas
ures ' to â¢ prevent the . feeding of.tubercu
lous horseflesh to chickens. An attempt
will be made to prohibit the shipment of
diseased horses from ! this city â¢ to : Peta
luma. If ; this method fails the board
will attempt to prohibit the sale of the
Petaluma chickens in* this city. The
lÂ»oard decided on- this step rafter an in
vestigation by which it was learned that
many of the "horses which are ground
into chicken feed are infected. v
Some of the members of the board
even advocated ' the exclusion of j con
sumptives from this city, but It ' was
finally decided, that such a., rigorous
movement is not necessary at the pres
ent time. , % ' ' - '.;.
If the intentions of the members of the
State Board, of Health as expressed in
the meeting which was held yesterday
afternoon In the F,erry building are car
ried into effect persons . infected with
tuberculosis will no 'longer be permittetd
to mingle with the general public. The
board passed a resolution requesting the
County Board of Health to segregate all
tuberculous patients. Thls*tep was taken
after a .prolonged discussion, the I board
deciding that inasmuch as tuberculosis is
contagious- it would jeopardize the health
of the public to allow people who are af
fected with it to be at large. '

Rear Admiral Schley will make no state
ment concerning the character of the ap
peal he will make to the President. It is
expected that it will be a. -voluminous
document, which will follow to a consider
able extent the bill of exceptions which
was submitted to Secretary Long. In view
of the prospect that Attorney General
Knox will examine the proceedings of the
court, there is considerable comment as to
his attitude with respect to Rear Admiral
Schley.- Knox has not taken sides in the
controversy. It is recalled that he denied
the request of the Navy Department last
summer to designate an assistant attor
ney general to assist the judge advocate
In cross-examination of witnesses called
during the-investigation. This has created
the impression that he Is an admirer of
Rear Admiral Schley. The Navy Depart
ment has no objection, however, -to a
reference of the whole matter to him for
review. \
It was suggested to-day that the Presi
dent in consenting to review the proceed
ings of the court has reflected upon the
honesty and judgment of the officers com
posing it. As a matter of fact, the Presi
dent has a high opinion of Admiral Dewey
and of Rear Admirals Ramsay and Ben
ham, and there, is reason to believe- that
he acquainted Rear Admiral Schley with'
his opinion of these officers. - . .
.This means that no legislatttm for the
benefit of Rear'Admiral Schleywill be en
acted during the present session. If a
resolution should be adopted , legislating
the rear admiral into the grade of vice
admiral it will be vetoed by the President.
Secretary Long and the court itself will
riot assist in the review of the proceed
ings of the court which investigated Rear
Admiral conduct, which will be
made by the President and Attorney Gen
eral, except to give assistance in supply
ing Â¦ Information should it be ' desired. ------

and Chairman Knapp of the commission
announced that owing to the fact that
the gentlemen mentioned were best quali

It had been thought best to postpone the

declared that if necessary the witnesses

to attend. Hill, he said, had sent a spe

CHICAGO. Jan. 8.â Owing to the ab

of the Interstate Commerce Commission
into the workings of the "community "of

postponed until January 24 and the com
mittee itself adjourned to meet in Chi

be slated for the traffic directorship of
the Northwestern lines If their consolida
tion is not prevented, were present, as
were a number of other railroad men.
The transportation committee of the
Kansas City Board of Trade has decided
to aid ' the commission, and the freight
agents here may follow the example set
by their superior officers in Chicago yes

Chicago testimony has put a new face on
the hearing here and grain shippers are
wondering what tack they should take.

CHARITY BALL
DRAWS SOCIETY
TO THE PALACE
Minister Conger is endeavoring to re
store friendly relations at Newchwang.
He is urging the United- States Consul
there, Henry B. Miller, to co-operate
with the Russian authorities in suppress
ing and punishing violence. Â¦ The steps
taken are so far seriously handicapped by
the action of the Russians, who refuse to
allow foreigners to use the telegraph line.
The foreigners at | Newchwang attribute
the trouble largely to lack of tact upon
the part of the Administrator.
The memorandum presented by the
Russian Minister to the United States
Minister here related to various alleged
assaults committed by Americans. On
one occasion, it was asserted, three sail
ors attacked a. sentry, and owed their
lives to the sentry's forbearance in not
exercising his right to shoot. The Ad
ministrator demanded that the United
States Consul . try the offenders, but the
commander of the Vicksburg, E. B.
Barry, wrote a curt refusal.
Relations between â¢ the American and
British Consuls and . naval commanders
and the Russian Administrator -at New
chwang are strained, which makes a
friendly settlement of the affair difficult.
The Administrator attempted to enforce
a social code which the foreign officials
refused to recognize and consequently
their relations have been limited to strict
ly business interviews and these have not
been amicable, consisting mostly on the
one side of protests from the Administra
tor against the conduct of the sailors. Â¦
PEKING, Jan. 8.â While the actual cas
ualties during the fighting at Newchwang
between American sailors belonging to
the United States Vicksburg,
which is : wintering there; and Russian
soldiers attached t6 the] garrison at that
port are trifling up to date, the matter
has resulted' in unpleasantly strained re
lations between the j American, Russian
and British authorities there. The Wash
ington and St. Petersburg governments
are now endeavoring to arrange matters
so that there, may be no further friction.
} The trouble originated in the action of
borne sailors belonging to the â¢ Brltiih
sloop-of-war jp Algerine, also in : winter
quarters at Newchwang, in . carrying
ashore six rifles for. use In a theatrical
performance. The Russian administra
tion sent a force of men to arrest the
British sailors. The Russians, however,
by mistake broke into a reading room
where a party of the Vicksburg men were
seated and tried to arrest them. - The
Americans resisted, defending themselves
with chairs; They were overpowered after
a sharp fight, however, and handed over
to the United States Consul, who sent
them on board the Vicksburg. The bad
feeling which: arose from tnis incident
resulted in several fights whenever. Amer
ican or British sailors met Russian sol
diers; and the latter, no tN- being accus
tomed to fist fights, were . usually badly
worsted. ,This condition of affairs cul
minated on New Year's day. In a more
serious affray, and tho Russian Minister,
Paul Lessar, complained to Minister Con
ger that two members of 'the Vicksburg
crew had fired a revolver at an unoffend
ing Russian soldier, wounding him in the
arm. * r
Moreover, he did not believe .that any
gentleman could read the report and tell
which route the commission would have
settled, had the cost and conditions been
equal. In embarking upon an enterprise
that was to cost $200,000,000, perhaps more,
he considered It wise that the experts
should have an opportunity ' to consider
the new offer of the Panama Company.
If the bill was passed in the form in
which it ' was reported, the President
could not entertain the offer of the Pan
ama Company and under it the President
by treaty might. bind the United States
to construct the Nicaraguan canal, even
though we afterward became convinced
that the other one was the better route.
Morri3 of Minnesota explained the pur
pose of his amendment, which, he said,
was; not to impede the construction of
the canal, but to Insure the selection of
the best canal. Before the Isthmian Com
mission made its report he did not believe
the Panama route feasible. He thought
it had been used solely for the purpose of
delay. But since reading the report he
was unable to j reach a conclusion as to
which was the better route. . \
The speakers to-day; were Shackleford
of Missouri, Parker of New Jersey, Lov
ering of Massachusetts, Morris of Minne
sota, Burton of Ohio, Hill of Connecticut.
Bromwell of Ohio, Gillett of Massachu
setts and Little of Maine, in favor of the
Morris amendment, and Burgess of
Texas, Bell of Colorado, Cooney of Miss
ouri, Cummings of New York, Gibson of
Tennessee and Lacey of Iowa, for the bill
in its present form.
Of the sixteen members who j spoke to
day" nine favored the Morris amendment.
It was agreed that general debate should
close to-morrow at 2 o'clock, after which
the bill may be open to debate under the
five-minute rule. The final vote probably
will be taken to-morrow. . .
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8.â The debate on
the ' Nicaragua canal bill ibrday developed
a sentiment for giving consideration to the
recent offer of the Panama Company |to
cell its franchises and property for $40,-
OOO.WO, this sentiment taking the form of
advocating the Morris amendment to em
power the President to select the latter
route if the Canal Commission, upon con
sidering *the company's offer, recommends
it and the Required concessions, can be ob
tained from Colombia. \ ; .

"The last speaker." said the Count,
"alluded to a reference that an English
Minister recently made to the 'German
army's conduct in the Franco-German
war. I believe. we are all agreed and 1
think all sensible Englishmen agree with
us that when a, Minister considers himself
called upon to justify his policy he does
well to leave foreign countries out of the
discussion."^-. ;; Â¦; Â¦ â¢â¢,'..
9 Count von Stolberg-Wernigerode (Con
servative) discussed the economic crisis
and urged the creation of' fresh sources
of revenue. Touching on the friendly re
lations existing between Germany and
other countries the Count denounced the
recent reference of Chamberlain to the
German army. Count von Bulow followed.
Baron von Thielmann said further that
the budget for 1901 was the worst in years
and that the greatest difficulty was ex
perienced in maintaining a balance be
tween the revenue and expenditure in the
estimates for 1902. ' . . Â¦
My former reference to the deterioration of
the financial position, which Â¦ were regarded in
many quarters as pessimism, have been con
firmed. Affairs have become even -.. more un
favorable than we were able to foresee, as, -ow
ing to the economic depression, the receipts
have fallen off considerably and. the individual
states of the empire are no longer able to bear
their matrlcular contributions. Especially is
this so in the case of the small Thurlngian
states. ' - - ..Â¦Â¦".â¢
The Reichstag Â¦ reassembled to-day after
the Christmas recess, with rather a slim
attendance and the discussion of the esti
mates began. The statement of the finan
cial condition of the empire by Baron
Thielmann, Secretary of State for tho
Treasury, was even more pessimistic on
the subject, of the declining trade of Ger
many than were his earlier. utterances on
the Question. He aaid:
The concluding '-. portion' of Emperor
William's speech pointed to the necessity
of adopting measures against tho agita
tion in j the Polish- districts of Eastern
Prussia, declared that the upholding of
the political and economic position of the
German element there was . necessary for
the self-preservation of Prussia and prom
ised that the Government would , fulfill
its duty in cultivating the German na
tional spirit in that region and in com
bating with firmness all tendencies â¢ hos
tile to the state. In this course the'Gov
ernment counted on â¢ the support of the
German S population of '. East Prussia, as
well as on the assistance of the whole
nation, which regarded any attempt to
drive out the German language as an at
tack on its national honor and dignity.
ThV speech, announced plans for legis
lation providing for the â¢ housing of state
workmen and of . officials earning small
salaries. Considerable credits are demand
ed for the extension of the state rail
roads and the promotion and construction
of light railroads. A new canal' bill,' to
complete '- the â¢ system of waterways will
be submitted.. - _.-. . .';
In the budget for 1902 the revenue is cs T
timated below that of the j current year,
but j the balance between the revenue and
the expenditure is to be maintained with
out having recourse to a loan.-
.BERLIN, Jan. : 8.â The. speech from the
throne, read'bythe Imperial Chancellor,
Count von Bulow, at the opening of the
Prussian Diet '.to-day,; took a gloomy view
of .the econonvic "situation.- It pointed out
that the rever.ue from the state railroads'
in 1901 fell considerably short of the eatl
mates and r that the ; whole results of the
financial; year were 1 disappointing. \%
Wilson protested against what he
termed unlawful intimidation, claiming
that the Chinese were employed because
It was impossible to secure white labor,
and notified the Chinese that ha would
see they were protected in their rights If
they would- continue to work. After a
short consultation among themselves
the Chinese agreed â¢ to leave the town
this 'afternoon. They quit work at noon
and nothing has been done at the pack
ing-house this afternoon. Wilson threat
ened to keep the men at work . under . a.
guard, but the Chinese were thoroughly
frightened and no inducement would get
them to eo to work again.
The committee Immediately went to tha
packing-house and notified the Chinese
that they must leave town to-day; that
If "they did they would not be molested,
but if they refused they must take th<*
consequences; that the white laboring
men of the community, backed by publics
sentiment,- were thoroughly aroused and
did not propose to permit foreign cheap
labor to come in here and take the work
that belonged to those who lived here and
paid taxes and helped to support tho
town. -.'"Â¦. Â¦â¢;\<^~ .,'â¢ '-'i\ w
The foreman immediately notified his
firm in Los Angeles, and soon afterward
Sheriff Hammel wired Deputy Sheriff Ben
Davisson of Duarte to go to Monrovia
and protect the Chinese laborers from -any
Injury or violence. He stated that depu
ties would arrive from Los Angeles early
in the morning to relieve him and guar
antee the safety of the Chinese.
The packing firm of Bruner & Smith of
Los Angeles, operating here, was notified
that at an. Indignation meeting held last
night it was decided that their gang of
Chinese must leave the town. The firm's
foreman, Wilson, who arrived from Los
Angeles this morning, was met by a com
mittee and informed of the determination
of the laboring men of Monrovia anrt
Duarte. "Wilson notified them that the.
Chinese were brought here to pack
oranges, and that he would not listen to
any proposition that sought their expu!
sion from the town. â¢ - -
MONROVIA, Jan. 8.â The anti-Chinese
labor, agitation broke out afresh this
evening, and the agreement whereby Chi
nese laborers were to finish packing a car
they were at work on was repudiated.
The ! Chinese became so frightened that
they promised to leave town on the first
train in the morning.' Â¦
The first subject to be discussed to-mor
row will be sewerage. The use of crude oil
for street sprinkling will be next dis

rection of a committee headed by Mayor
Snyder. will be given a visual demonstra

prison â¢ or - when : discharged. . Prisons," he'
said, also 'failed in so far as reforming
criminals, and society, â¢ he declared, was
protected only so long as the convicted
were behind the Jail doors; The prisons
are schools . of " vice, where those- who
graduate from the saloons .finished their
criminal education. There â¢Â¦Â¦ Is what Is
called â¢ a "congregate system" . In prisons
that admits of the old and the young, the
hardened offender and the novitiate indis
criminately associating together.
. During his incarceration King made a
study .or criminal sociology, and has writ
ten Â¦ a" novel i entitled "The - World" Against
Him," in* which he deals with what he
calls "the popular prejudice that society
heaps upon. the man who has-been con

In certain quarters a study Is being
made ; of the subject of the taxation of
the Southern Pacific ' Company properties
in this State. In a few weeks new as
sessments will begin for the current year.
Corporations that have to pay. more than
their share oÂ£, taxes because of the t^s
shirking abilities of the" great railroad cor
poration are interested. It' may be' re
caled that when the State Board of
Equalization- completed its work* in 1901
the Southern - Pacific Company's railroad
lines were assessed : at " the rate of only
$10,500 per mile in this State. â¢ The Cen
tral Pacific Company's lines were assessed
at $17,408 53 per mile. Taking all the prop
erties that . belonged to ' the . Southern Pa
cific Company at the, time of the last is
sue of Poor's Manual, the statistics being
brought down to the date of June 30, 1900,
the total mileage then owned by the com
pany - was , 7865. The ! gross earnings for
the entire system Â» actually owned by the
company averaged 18106 66 per . mile and
the : net earnings were $2194 84, . even ac
cording to the figures oi the company.
The debt averaged more than 129,117 per
mile,' the total .capital stock then being
$197,832,148 and the bonded debt $31,176,500.
Nevertheless, with these facts in view,
when the State' Board of Equalization
made up^ the last â¢ assessment Â¦ finally the
Southern Pacific Company got off at the
easy rate of $10,500 per mile. Where real
estate is mortgaged in California the
mortgage 1 is assessed at its full value.
The railroad company - escaped with an
assessment' that was so much smaller
than > the value of even the debts against
it that it -was ridiculous. The average
debt -of all' the mileage owned by the
Southern Â¦ Pacific > Company does not rep
resent ;the Â¦ debt per mile â¢ In this State,
where the earning capacity Is several fold
greater than that . of the lines leading
through Nevada, Arizona, Texas and New
Mexico.' Some .difficulty is met with in
giving the 'exact bonded and stock liabil
ity of the railroad mileage of the.South
ern Pacific Company in California, as the
tabulations â¢ do - not segregate it conclu
sively; but the lines in this State; on the
basis of earnings and the selling. price of
stook, are worth $80,000 to $90,000 per mile.
THe assessment last year was for : only
about one-eighth of -the actual- value of
the -property and for only about one
fourth of what it Is mortgaged for.
