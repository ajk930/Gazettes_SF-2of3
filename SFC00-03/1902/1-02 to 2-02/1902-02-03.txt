Not only is the matter going to stir up
a political mess locally, but Murray's ac
tions have called forth a special order
from President Roosevelt against the use
of any influence by a Government em
ploye to secure an increase of salary.'
A short time ago' the papers contained
a dispatch from Washington that Con
gressman Loud was opposed to Congress
man Hill's bill which provided an increase
of $100 per year In the pay of the rural
carriers. Thjs caused some feeling among
the rural carriers here, and Murray, it is
claimed, attempted to organize the j car
riers for the purpose of helping the bill
to pass and defeating the purpose of
Loud. Postmaster! Hawley heard of this
sentiment against the Congressman and
at once notified Postmaster General
Payne, who responded with an order for
Murray's immediate dismissal. President
Roosevelt was also notified, and he de
cided that such things must stop and Is
sued the order, which is aimed to head off
political influence to boost the pay of
Government employes in future.
Now the other rural carriers are guess
ing among themselves if the heads ; of
some of the rest are not liable to fall.
The mail carriers of this city held a meet-
Ing this afternoon and passed resolutions
that they had none but the kindliest feel
ing toward Congressman Loud, and dis
claimed any connection with the agitation
of the rural carriers. â¢ ,- â¢ .
SAN JOSE, Feb. 2.-Gavin Murray, a

believe that life and property are unsafe

others ; ridicule this idea and declare life
and property to be in no danger.

TERDAY TO SERVE FOR THE ENSUING YEAR.
â¢ This evening the bodies^' of the Biddies
were removed from the jail to the Sher
iff s dwelling and the public was given an
opportunity, to view them. Hundreds of
people braved the worst .blizzard of the
year to pass by the bodies, and late to
night a long line of men and women -was
standing ;ln front of the d6or. the wind
blowing about their ears and the drlvin"
snow stinging their faces, waiting their
turn. The women were especially curious
to see Ed Biddle, who, in life had been
credited with charming so many of them
Mrs. - Soffel is reported . to be spittin^
blood to-night, and her . condition is nol
considered favorable: . * .
The Biddies and Mrs. Soffel made, a vain
flight from Justice and retribution swiftly
came on them. The blindness and infatuation
cf this woman In- leaving her husband and
helpless little children for a gang of despera
does is. the worst criminal act thus far la the
history of the twentieth century '
The Rev. Samuel Cronin Wett of St
Mark's Evangelical Lutheran Church,' in
his sermon to-night, spoke at t length of
the criminal history made in Butler Coun
ty in the past few days. He criticized se
verely the woman, whom he held responsi
ble for the whole affair. He said:
The poor boys died like dogs, literally ild
dled with bullets, and some one should be held
responsible for Inhuman actions in shooting
them when entirely helpless, unarmed and
unable to make* the slightest defense.
Â¦ While ministering to them almost every hour
after they were brought to Jail, they often
would talk to mo of how they wero wron~ljr
accused of crimes. They denied positively that
they kined Grocer Kahney in Mount Washing
ton, and Ed told me in the most emphatic
terms that he did not shoot Detective Patrick
Fitzgerald. . . Â¦ .... â¢Â¦

Biddle boys to the newspapers and officers, both
Ed and Jack Biddle made confessions" to me
Ed s was made on Friday night; there was no
one present but myself and Jack lying in the
next cell. Jack did not confess until yesterday
Their confessions were full and complete lii

Speaks in' Defense of the Dead.
I Slnde'the officers concerned hr the fight
and capture of the Biddies have had time
to cool off a little there appears to be a
disposition to be fair toward, each other
in the manner of the distribution of the
prize money, and an agreement to divide
the $5000 equally among the four officers
here,, the driver, J." A. Snyder, - and the
three Pittsburg detectives, has been prac
tically consented to.
The pastors of nearly all the churches in
Butler to-day referred to the sensational
capture of Mrs. Soffel and the Biddies.
The Rev. Father Walsh, rector of St.
Paul's Roman Catholic Church, who min
istered to the Biddies in their dying hours,
spoke touchingly of them to the members
of his congregation. He touched briefly
on their statements given out, and said it
was for every person to decide for them
selves as to the Innocence or guilt of the
men. â¢ When seen at his residence this aft
ernoon Father Walsh said:
Officers Will Divide the Reward.
After the autopsy the bodies of the
Biddies were taken in charge by a local
undertaker. Arrangements are being
made to take the bodies to Pittsburg to
morow. '. * Â»
An autopsy held on the Biddies this
morning bore out the statements that
the Biddies intended to ' kill themselves
rather than be taken alive. It disclosed
that Jack suffered from nine wounds,
but, excepting the one that penetrated
the kidney, none of them would have
been fatal. Edward's terrible sufferings
were caused by a bullet wound that
struck him in the left breast. This
wound was. made by Edward himself.
The powder marks are visible on the
skin. Death was caused by hemorrhages
and the man suffered untold agony to
the last breath. Another wound j found
on his body was on the same side, but it
did no damage. Both bullets found in
Ed were 32-caliber. and, in the opinion
of the doctors who held the autopsy,
there is no doubt that he killed himself.
I could not say. He could still speak.
. Did he strike with considerable force?
He hit him a good hard biff with the butt of
the gun. ' â¢
. Shoots Prisoner on the Ground.
McGovern and I walked up to them. They
were both lying on their faces. I walked up
first and McGovern swore at me for it. He
hit Jack on the back of the head with the
butt end of Â¦ his Winchester when he was on
Ills face. Then I turned Ed over on his back.
I was the 1 first to touah either of the men and
McGovern was going to shoot them again. He
stepped back and shof Jack again after he was
on the ground.. He turned Eii over, and Ed
said: "For God' 8 sake don't shoot again â let
me die." Holliday turned Jack over and
coaxed McGovern not to abuse him, to let him
die. ' /..". â¢ :
' The slugs that entered the arms and side
of Jack Biddle were from the shot fired by
McGovern. after he was 'lying- face downward
on the snow, at close range? â¢
Yes, ..sir,- I am sure pf that. I was within
a few feet.
Do you think the striking of Jack on the
head with a gun had anything to do with the
hastening of his death?

after the convicts had been shot and had
fallen from the sleigh Deputy Hoon said:

Western New York generally to-day expe
rienced the second big snowstorm of the
season. A fifty-mile an hour gale drifted
the fine snow on to the railroad tracks.
SYRACUSE, N. Y., Feb. 2.â The wind is
blowing thirty-five miles an hour and the
heavy wet snow is drifting badly in Syra
cuse and in Central New York.
CINCINNATI. Feb. 2.â All danger of a
flood in the Ohio Valley has passed, the
cold weather having checked the rise in
the Ohio River, which is now falling rap
idly.
KALAMAZOO, Mich., Feb. 2.^-A storm
has been in progress here for nearly
twenty-four hours. Nearly a foot of snow
has fallen and it is drifting, badly imped
ing railroad traffic.
BROCKWAYVIL.LE, Pa., Feb. 2.â A
terrifio gale, considered the heaviest and
most damaging snow and wind storm In
the history of this section, is raging to
night, and this town is completely tied
up. Passenger and freight trains on all
roads are blocked on acount of heavy
snowdrifts and driveways through the
country districts. Reports from towns
north of here state a blockade and con
siderable amount of damage as a result of
the storm.
CORRY. Pa.. Feb. 2.â The worst bliz
zard of the season is raging in North
western Pennsylvania to-night. The Penn
sylvania train for Buffalo left three hours
late, drawn by three engines, and may
not get through. The road has three snow
plows in use. Telegraph wires are work
ing poorly and the country roads are im
passable.
Since sundown Â¦ to-day a gale has been
blowing continuously at Sandy Hook, and
at .times the wind reached the rate of
over sixty miles an hour. The electric
lighted buoys marking Gedney channel
and the southwest spit were extinguished
to-night owing to the heavy sea grounding
the cables. On account of their interrupt
tion the French line steamer l'Aquitaine,
from Havre, and the Hamburg-American
Line steamer , Phoenicia, from Hamburg
and Boulogne, each carrying many pas
sengers, were forced to anchor outside of
the Sandy Hook bar.
NEW YORK, Feb. 2.â A storm that has
been prevalent all day in this section'of
the country made itself manifest in this
city and suburbs, to the;great discomfort
of all people who ventured out of doors.
On top of a heavy fall of snow 1 came rain,
which turned the snow into slush and
made swamps of low-lying grounds. In
the early afternoon the rain turned to
snow, and a little later this condition dis
appeared in the face of a decided drop in
the temperature. This was accompanied
by a gale, which in exposed quarters broke
branches of trees, blew away insecure
boarding, tangled up wires and sent store
signs flying to .the streets. One fatality
from a falling sign was reported here in.
the early evening. Tb-night the high
wind continues and the temperature
dropped. The signal bureau predicts a
fall to 10 degrees above zero before the
lowest mark is reached.

Mr. White told Prince Henry that the
city of Chattanooga desired to present
him with an album of views. The Prince
said he would be delighted to accept the
album. Mr. White said he was sorry that
the Prince could not go to Florida and
see something: of the tropical United
States during the winter months. Prince
Henry also regrets that his stay in the
United States will be so limited as to
prevent him seeing- many other places to
which he has been invited.

physicians there confirmed my case as dia-

diet. Getting no relief. I went home. I got
steadily worse and went to another, well-known
city hospital. The physicians there also said
diabetes, and stated that . they could prolong
my .life, but that I could never be well. I
left the hospital after a few months completely
broken down, the percentage of sugar being 11
per cent. Â¦ It â¢ was at this Juncture I heard of
the Fulton Compound and sent for It. The

' Mr. Rockhill states that during the ne
gotiations "the Russian Minister re
marked that if the sum total of claims
fell short of $337,000,000 the balance should
be given back to China."- Russia, how
ever, had comparatively few private
claims, the principal damage for whicn
she claimed compensation having- been
done to her railroad crossing Manchuria.
In administration circles it is not be-"
lleved that Europe will be disposed to re
turn any of the sums which will be paid
by China. Since the signature of -the
peace protocol some of the powers have
filed additional claims for compensation,
and if any governments return portions
of their indemnity to China these will be
demanded for the satisfaction of new
claims. It is this aspect of the situation
which is causing the United States to
hesitate about relinquishing the difference
between the amount of its actual damages
and expenses and the $25,000,000 which
China has agreed to pay.
Subsequently Great Britain suggested
that the indemnity be fixed at $297,000,000.
Secretary Hay authorized Mr. Rockhill to
accept the British proposition if nothing
better could be agreed upon. It failed,
however, in consequence of its abandon
ment by the British Government, and the
powers then agreed to demand an indem
nity of $337,000,000.
Great Britain's share of the enormous
indemnity demanded of China was $25,800,
000. During the negotiations the British
Government was opposed to the exaction
of a sum which would embarrass the Chi
nese Government, and Mr. Rockhill re
ports that she ; suggested the scaling oi.'
the indemnity to 3250,000,000, China to
make a loan in the open market sufficient
to pay one-half of that amount and to
make arrangements with the powers as
to the mode and time of payment of the
other half. But the British as well as the
American proposal to fix the indemnity at
3250,000,000 was not adopted by the diplo
matic corps.

All through the deliberation there was
a desire expressed on all sides to depart
as much as possible from the ordinary
routine that has obtained heretofore and
to at once launch into, preparations for
the event. John O'Gara, president of the
convention of 1901, called the meeting to
order and explained what it was hoped to
accomplish. T. J. Mellott was chosen tem
porary chairman arid George L. Lowe and
T. J. Alford temporary secretaries. Then
came the appointment of the following
committees:
THE convention of the delegate's
from the Irish societies of this
city called to prepare for the cele
bration of next St. Patrick's day
assembled yesterday afternoon in
Knights of the Red Branch Hall, on Mis
sion street. The assemblage was remark
able for the number, of priests who par
ticipated in the deliberations and for the
number of women delegates accredited to
the convention. One of the ladies was
honored with a high office.

XEW YORK. Feb. 3.â The World says:

fiom one of the prisonersâ a missive that
traveled 10,000 miles before reaching its

had no money and no stamp, so the letter
was posted bare of postage and came with
two ten-cent C. O. D. stamps affixed by
the United States Postottice Department.
The prisoner, an American, says in his
letter that books, journals and newspa

tinues:
"The food supplied to the prisoners of

McCullough says he attempted to turn
off the flow of oil into the furnace, but
turned it on instead. The burning oil
got beyond controj and destroyed the
electric works, which were owned by
.Tames Cross, formerly one of the execu
tors of the Hobart t estate. The loss is
about $10,000.
It is thought that the blow-off pipes
became uncoupled and that the force of,
the steam hurled Christie on a pile of
rocks, causing a fracture of ' the skull.
McCullough shares the opinion of tne
officers that the man was murdered.
RED BLUFF, Feb. 2.â The people here
are considerably exercised over the death
of Engineer Fred Christie of the Tehama
Electric Works early this morning. The
officers assert, and many people believe,
that he was murdered, but no sufficient
fact has yet been obtained upon which
to hang this conjecture. William McCul
lough, however. Is in jail, and there will
be an investigation.
Christie, who "had been in the employ
of the electric company for several
months, went to work at midnight. Mc-
Cullough, a lineman, who was out of em
ployment, says he was asleep in the dyna
mo room when the stopping of the ma
chinery aroused him. He awoke just as
the machinery ceased to move and the
lights went out.
McCullough gave an alarm and Captain
Deshlelds, the watchman at the Sierra
Lumber Company's factory, responded.
An investigation revealed the dead body
of Christie at the sleuth end of the boiler
room outside the building. He had
turned on the exhaust valve to blow out
the boiler and his head lay near a pipe.
The skull was crushed.

The issue is up to the British workingmen and the
manufacturers. They are the elements who forced
the repeal of the corn larws and the adoption of a free
trade policy. ' It is now incumbent upon them to
show how they can maintain that policy without
crippling the finances of the nation. The Govern
ment needs money, the financiers" advise customs d\i!
ties, the farmers demand protection, the imperialists
wish special favors for the colonists. Against all
those forces the free-traders must manage to hold
their own or a grain' tax will be one of the burdens
the British workingmen will have, to bear as a'con
sequence of* Chamberlain's- imperial policy in South ;
Africa.. It isinoOprobable it will be imposed at this
session v ol Parliament, for this is.no time for the
As may be supposed, the scheme has won. the ap
proval of the land-owners and the farmers. The
London papers abound with letters advocating the
grain tax. Some urge it is a measure designed to
promote home agriculture as well as to raise a rev
enue for the country. Others are in favor, of exempt
ing from the tax grain imported from the colonies,
thus to some extent weakening its effect as a protec
tive measure. It is their claim that the admission of
colonial grain free of duty while foreign grain is sub
ject to taxation would have the effect of strength
ening the ties of the empire by establishing fresh
interests between the colonies and the mother
country.
Sir Robert Giffen, who is eminent as a financier as
well as a statistician, has recently submitted in a
public letter a scheme of- taxation which he deems
best fitted to' meet the emergency. He would make
the income tax tenpence a pound for the present,
but on the close of the war would reduce it to six
pence. He woul4 increase taxes on tea, sugar,
petroleum . and beer, and in addition thereto would
impose one shilling per quarter registration duty
Â¦jpon imported grain.
LORI} SALISBURY may have not the slight
est intention Â¦ to ask Parliament to im
pose a tax on grain imports, but none
the less the people of Great Britain are dis
cussing the proposition as eagerly as if it
were one of practical politics. The war in South
Africa has brought about a big increase in the na
tional debt, -which must be paid off, and it has also
caused a large deficiency in the revenue, which must
be met. It is said by some authorities that direct
taxatior in the kingdom has reached the limit and
that any further taxation must be by customs duties.
Holding to that belief they unhesitatingly advise' a
duty on grain as most likely to yield a large revenue
at a comparatively small cost for collection.
A BRITISH BREAD TAX.
As a matter of fact the United States is under no
moral responsibility to guarantee good markets for
Cuban sugar, nor prosperity for the Cuban people.
We went to their aid_ to Telieve them from the burden
of Spanish" rule and the relief has been duly given.
It is now for them to work out their destiny as an
.independent people. If we once undertake to sup
port them, there will never be a, time when we will
not have to continue that support/ ; ' â¢
?f Evidence has been submitted to the Ways and
Means Committee of the House of % Representatives,
and published in The Call, showing that the demand
for free admission cf Cuban sugar to the United
i States comes mainly from American speculators who;
having bought Cuban estates at a low price, now'
1 wish to induce the United States to ruin the domestic
sugar industry for the sake of providing the specu
lators with " a profit. The scheme is an outrageous
one, and, as our correspondent shows, is indefensible
even upon the grounds assumed by the schemers.
The point is one which has already attracted the
attention of those who have given serious thought
to the Cuban claims. It has been pointed out by
The Call and by papers in the East.. Mr. Williams,
however, has stated it with such terseness as to give
it a new force and anew interest. His letter shows
that the people are not being deceived by the Cuban
claimants, but have a clear idea of the weakness of
the causeVhich the speculators in Cuban sugar plan
tations are supporting. â¢ ' . " '
WE present in another, column a letter from
: E. C. Williams upon the alleged moral re
sponsibility of the United States to guar
antee the prosperity of Cuba. Mr. Williams argues
that if such responsibility exist it rests upon the
whole people of the United States and is due to the
whole mass of the Cuban population; consequently
the scheme of shifting the burden so as to make it
fall exclusively upon the sugar growers of the United
States, while the benefits would go exclusively to the
sugar producers in Cuba, would be an injustice to
both sides.
THE CLAIMS OF CUBA.
A Baptist clergyman in Virginia who lost 202 ser
mons by negligence of a railway company sued for
damages, and, the matter having been left to a board
of arbitration composed of his fellow clergymen, they
assessed the' value of the sermons at $250, or $1 23
each. Such a valuation shows a Christian honesty
worthy of the highest praise. Had a board of law
yers been appointed to assess the value of an equal
damage done to the property of a fellow lawyer they'
would have taken. the railroad and demanded further
compensation from the stockholders.
The ."authoritative announcement" that ; Bio witz
had retired from the London. Times has now been
authoritatively denied; so while you may take your
choice of authorities and believe which you please
Blowitz will continue to draw his salary and pose as
the greatest special correspondent in Europe.
One point, however, deserves' attention. The fail
ures throughout the country during January showed
a large falling off in liabilities in iron, machinery,
cotton, lumber and chemical manufactures as com
pared with the corresponding month in 1001. This
shows that 'the crest of the wave of prosperity in
mam..- ..luring lias not yet passed.
The condition of tht important staples remains
about as before. There was more irregularity in* ce
reals last week, and prices bobbed about a good deal,
but like the traditional moth fluttering about the
candle, they did not .get very, far from base. The
boot and shoe trade of New England is reported in
a flourishing condition in spite of a further decline
in hides, the iron trade still booms, the distributive
trade of the country is excellent and money is not
stringent at New York. Otherwise there is very
little to be said of trade last week.
THE United States has never been so flush
with funds as during the past year or two.
With the possible exception of New York,
which, being the banking center of the country, is
apt to be c<!led upon for immense amounts at a mo
ment's notice, all sections of the land have plenty
of money. This abundance amounts to a plethora
at many points, and has been the chief factor in the
formation of those great combines which have caused
the whole world to stop and stare. California has
her pocket full as well as the other sections, as
shown by the reports of her 267 State banks to the
Bank Commissioners. According to these reports
the aggregate of assets and liabilities of the 2fy] banks
it the close of business on December 31, 1901, was
$371,547,9/2, which was a gain" of $36,702,700 over
1900. This exhibit is said to be without precedent
in this State and illustrates the prosperity of Califor
nia in a nutshelL The main item of increase was in
deposits, which were $290,076,000, an increase for this
account of $31,147,900. That this large increase has
gone into circulation in different forms of investment
is shown by the small increase in the cash on hand,
which was only $554,3*8 more than on the corre
sponding date the previous year. Yet with all this
increase in investments the banks, both city and
country, have large amounts which they are eager
lo loan, and no solvent borrower, who has good av
erage security to put up, finds any difficulty in secur
ing whatever accommodation he desires. The State
may not have much rain nor many people, but it has
lots of money. The effect on business cannot but
be highly beneficial, and, indeed, the record of the
San Francisco Clearing-house for January shows a
most gratifying condition of trade, the clearings for
the month being $105,570,793, against $90,043,134 in
January, 1901, an increase last month of about $14,
630,000. This showing ought to satisfy anybody.. If
we had received plenty of rain up to date we would
now be on velvet as far as crop prospects are con
cerned, and even as it is only an occasional district
here and there reports serious damage thus far. With
the usual spring rains the northern and central sec
tions will pull through all right, but the south needs
a good deal more moisture to insure average crops.
Like California, the great winter wheat belt of the
United States has been in need of moisture up to
the recent blizzard, which covered the plant with
snow and stopped all croaking about a crop failure
in that section, except in the extreme Southwest,
where the ground is still dry. This snowfall has
allayed a good deal of apprehension throughout the
Western and Eastern parts of the country and given
more tone to business generally. There is nothing
that affects trade more than the condition of the
great cereal crops. The feeling throughout the coun
try is now more buoyant than ever. The outlook for
the spring trade is reported greatly improved, though
the very blizzard that caused the improvement cut
down general trade materially for the time being, as
was to have been expected. It favored the future at
the expense of the present, which is not an unmixed
evil.

PERSONAL MENTION.
A CHANCE TO SMILE
A BOOK or scandal, written by Eugene Jules Olivier, an ensign in the
French navy, has created a great stir In naval circles in that country, and
the author has been dismissed from the service. The book is entitled
' "Les Maritlmes," in which nearly all the characters are naval officers,
which, under fictitious names are, with few exceptions, depicted as blackguards of
the most pronounced type, and envy, hatred, malice, vice and corruption are said
to be rampant through the navy. The commanders and lieutenants are described
as lazy and addicted to every kind of vice, including opium smoking ashore and
aboard. The engineers are alluded to as "dirty Freemasons" by the deck officers,
and a doctor refuses to report an officer unfit for duty for fear of arousing the ire
of the paymaster, and so on. Even the women do not escape scandalous reflec
j tions, and as a natural result Mr. Olivier has' already been compelled to fight five
duels, and has several others in prospect. It is inferred from the violence of the
animosity displayed against the writer that there is some truth In his charges.
â¢ and British papers felicitate themselves that such a book would be quite impossi
ble in England. . â¢ .
The plans for the construction of the new turret ship Henri IV, building at
Cherbourg, have mysteriously disappeared, and there is great perturbation in
naval circles. As the Henry IV is the most unique freak of imagination in naval
architecture it is not likely that the plans have been stolen with a view of
duplicating the ship in any other navy.' The ship, begun In May, 1897, was not
launched until ; August. 1899, is still far from completion and, according to the
- opinion of /competent naval critics, the Henri IV will only be another addition to'
the many failures in French naval vessels. â¢"
â¢ Three third class cruisers in the French navy, the ; ; Cocklogon,' Forbin < and
Troude, are to be modernized, although they are only about thirteen years old.
They were built for high Bpeeds, which were never realized, and are to have new
engines, boilers and armaments.
The Reguln, coast defense ship, which has been undergoing reconstruction since
1898, has had a successful engine trial, developing 6230 horsepower, with only ten
out of her twelve Niclausse boilers in use. The ship was built in 18S5 and Is now
as good as new, having received modern machinery and an effective armament.
The cumbersome superstructures have also been greatly reduced and the gun pro
tection much improved.
An accident occurred on the French battleship Jena on January 18, during the
heavy gun trials. The sighting lever of one of the 12-Inch guns broke at the fourth
shot and caused considerable damage. All the heavy guns will undergo alterations
as a result of the accident and further trials will be postponed for a month.

The credit for abolishing flogging in the United States navy Is commonly given
to Commodore Robert F. Stockton, who served as a Senator from New. Jersey In
1851-52, having resigned from the navy May 28, 1850. The credit really belongs to
John P. Hale of New Hampshire, who introduced the humane measure in the
House of Representatives on June 3, 1844, but it was defeated in the Senate. Hale
subsequently became a Senator, and in September, ' 1850, the Senate passed the
resolution by a vote of 26 to 24, which, being concurred In by the
House and approved by the President, became- 'a law September 28, 1S50. Stockton
did not take his seat in the Senate until December 1, 1851, about fourteen months
after flogging had been prohibited, but In January. 1852, when attempts were
made to resurrect the barbarous practice. Stockton,* Hale and others opposed It,
and the navy was saved from further disgrace in that direction. Monuments have
been erected, testimonials, resolutions, vote of thanks, and medals, have been
awarded to commemorate deeds of heroism of high and ordinary performance of
plain duty, and it would seem to be quite fit and proper that the enlisted men in
the navy should remember In some suitable manner John P. Hale and Robert F.
Stockton, who abolished slavery in the navy. â¢
Five recently built battleships in the Italian navy are still in an uncompleted
condition for the want of money. The insignificant sum of $184,000 has been granted
to complete* and "put to sea the Benedetto Brin, Regina Margherita, Regina
Elena, Vlttorla Emanuele and Francesco Ferruccio. Three battleships are to be
laid down on which a first installment of $15,000 will be expended; two coaling ships
will cost $8000 each," and- $26,400 will be expended on twelve vessels of minor import
ance. The sum total toward naval Increase and repairs foots up to only $225,400
for the present year, which is the smallest amount to be expended by any naval
power.
A novel fort has just been completed at San Paolo Island, at the entrance to
the naval harbor of Tarantq. It is a large steel tower with external armor, said
to be five feet in thickness and weighs 50,000 tona. It contains two guns of heavy
caliber, and the tower can be turned In any direction by hydraulic power. Its
cost ,was $2,400,000. . .*. s> â¢
The process of weeding out useless vessels In the British navy keeps pace with
new building, resulting in large savings of money. The old ironclad coast defense
ships Glatton, Cyclops, Hecate and Gorgon, have been struck from the effective
list and relegated to the rows of hulks at the dockyards, to be either broken up
â¢ or sold for what their metal will bring. They were built over thirty years ago and
have performed no service whatever beyond instruction duty and an occasional
Â¦ participation in the naval maneuvers, where they demonstrated their utter use
lessness because of slowness and bad seagoing qualities. '
The old depot ship Urgent, for more than forty years located at Jamaica, Is at
last to be relieved and replace'd with the sheathed corvette Active, built in 1869.
but condemned four years ago as unfit for active service.
The new sloop Fantome, built at Sheerness, passed through her coal consump
: tlon trials of thirty hours last month with good results. With 180 pounds of steam
â¢ in her Niclausse boilers the engines developed 339 horsepower, giving a speed of
9^4 knots. "The Fantome Is one of a class of six sloops built since 1900, of which the .
- missing Condor, somewhat smaller, was the prototype. These vessels are of 1070
tons, 1400 horsepower and 13% knots speed, and are not to be confounded with
the torpedo-gunboats of the same size, built In 1894, in which the excessive speed,
of 19 knots has never been realized. .._ . '
It is stated that Philip Watts, successor to Sir William White, director of naval
construction In the British navy, is to receive a yearly salary of $17,500. His pre
decessor received $12,500, and Nathaniel" Barnaby, who retired in 1886 to make room
for Sir Edward White.- got only $7500 per annum."

The process which has thus been carried to a fair
degree of excellence will of course be improved in
the future, and eventually it will do away with color
presses. The Call is never content. with past accom
plishment, but always moves forward to something
better. -For the present, however, it has satisfaction
in what has been attained in the production of half
tones in colors. It is another triumph for California
journalism and for California art. *
- The excellence- of the work was apparent upon its
face. ThV colors blended^ harmoniously, not only
with- one another^ but with the lights ..and shadows
of the half-tone. A degree of richness'and brightness
was thus given to^the illustrations which could not
otherwise have been obtained. The pictures thus pre
sented differed from the ordinary colored supplement
pictures in every important artistic /respect. They
were not crude, they were not daubs, they were not
offensive to the eye. They were not caricatures, nor
coarse cartoons of bad drawing made lurid by glaring
colors, but specimerits of genuine artistio work.
The Call did not affront its readers' by the
tion of any crude experiments in that,- any more than
in any' other line of work. Just as it perfected by
quietly conducted experiments its system of wireless
telegraphy before attempting to make use of .-it, so
has it perfected the process of producing half-tones
m colors before making publication of them. Con
sequently the feat of obtaining by wireless telegraphy
the news of the arrival of the transport bearing home
the California Volunteers from the Philippines has
been followed by an equal success" in the publication
yesterday of artistically worked out- half-tones in
colors. Â¦
The production of half-tones in colors by a process
available for newspaper publication is no slight
achievement. It is, in fact; one of the triumphs of
the art of printing. Many efforts have been made
to accomplish it, but most of; these have resulted
in failure, and the colored half-tones whencpreserited
to the public have been nothing more than' blurred
pictures daubed with bits of misplaced color. They
have excited the derision of the public. and disguste'd
artists. So complete were these failures that in many
cases those who underwent them â¢ abandoned .. the
effort altogether and set aside as hopeless any desire
of producing that form of illustration , for newspapers^
T /ESTERDAY The Call presented* among the
| illustrations of the Sunday supplement a num
-*Â¦ be'r of half-tones, in colors. The fact deserves
more than a passing notice, because it was not only
the first time that such art work has been successfully
accomplished on the Pacific Coast, but was achieved
by a process of our own on an ordinary press used
in everyday printing. It represents, therefore, a new
development of California art in journalism and is
another of the many evidences around us that Cali
fornians are no longer dependent upon Eastern in
struction in art work, but are making an independent
headway along line's of their own/; â¢ - â¢â¢! \

Editor The, Call: "Why will you
not In your trenchant way put the mat
ter of reciprocity with Cuba upon the
ground that If the Cubans have a moral
claim upon the United States, then the
Unite*.! State3 should respond to it; and
whatever the claim may be let It be met
by retaining the war taxes,, and using the
revenue so. derived to meet the obligation,
instead of asking the beet and cane sugar
growers to settle Uncle Sam's bills? These
industries have assumed no obligations
moral or pecuniary toward Cuba. Let
those who have made the promises, if Any
have been made, see that they are kept.
If the United States pays to the Cubanr
republic fifty or sixty millions of dol
lars per annum for three or five years to .
jnake good any agreement, either posi
tive or implied, then the right party will
pay it, and the right one get the benefit;
while, according to the proposed plan, the
domestic sugar industries will pay the bill,
and American speculators in Cuban plan
tations will get the money, neither of
which parties have any interest In the
original bargain. Yours very truly,

While American interest in King Edward's coro
nation centers mainly on; the question what kind of
trousers Whitelaw Reid will wear, British interest is
concerned in the creation of new peerages. It is ex

Earls and Dukes they will have to do kow-tow to on

The increasing power of the Senate and the over
whelming prestige it has attained in legislation ever
since the House ceased to be a deliberative body is one
of the strongest causes of the increasing demand for
the election of Senators by direct vote of the people.
It is an indisputable proposition that in popular esti
mation the National Government is developing into
what may be called a "Senatorial Government." The
Senators assert the right of deciding whom the Presi
dent shall appoint to most of the Federal offices.
They claim the right of initiative in making treaties,
and asserted it successfully in negotiations with Great
Britain over the isthmian canal. They claim to be
able, in conjunction with the President, to make
treaties which will materially alter tariff duties and
the fiscal system of the nation. In short, the Senate
is encroaching upon both the President and the
House, and if the Representatives decide to make a 1
fight against the encroachments they will do well to
alter their recent methods of doing business and
make the fight in a way that will win popular sup
port. * , /
In the particular case in which the House purposes
to raise an issue against the aggressions of the Sen
ate the people will naturally turn to the Senate to
hear it discussed. The House will formulate its plat
form in a committee Toom. The matter will be re
ported and pqssibly debated for a day or two. In the
Senate the controversy will be discussed for a month.
The people will hear the argument of the Senators,
but they will hear nothing from the House. A con
test waged in that way can have but one result. The
Senators will win.
It is in the. Senate only that great measures are
fully discussed. It is in that body only that every
man has a chance. to be heard and the petitions of the
people receive attention. The consequence has been '
that the people look more and more to ,the Senate for
protection against hasty legislation. An illustration of
the situation is to be seen to-day in the progress of
the Philippine bill. Stanch Republicans are now look
ing to the Senate to remedy defects in that measure
passed by Republicans of the House. In fact, the
Senate has become the popular branch of the Legis
lature, and that means it is becoming by far the more
important branch.
For reasons thought good and sufficient the mem
bers of the House have given up all pretense of being
a deliberative body. Bills of the highest importance
are rushed through without a sufficient; amount of
debate to give the country any conception of the
meaning of the measures. 'The Committee on Rules
virtually controls legislation, and were it not that
newspaper correspondents gather information Â¦ from
committee rooms the people would have hardly
any knowledge at all of what sort of legislation is
under consideration. By that method of doing busi
ness the House gains in a certain kind of efficiency.
It passes within a few days bills which are before the
Senate for months. For that efficiency, however, it
pays a high price, and a part of. the cost has been
the diminished importance of the House as a gart of
the legislative branch of the Government.
y EADERS of both parties in the .House of Rep-
I resentatives are now engaged in devising
â¢Â¦â ' means whereby, to quote from the report from
Washington, "the House can defend itself against
what it considers the threatened invasion by the
Senate of its prerogative in the matter of revenue
legislation." The particular issue upon which the
House purposes to make a fight for itself is indeed
an important one, 'but it would be a great deal better
if the House would take into consideration the whole
question of its relations to the Senate and of the ex
tent to which it has subordinated itself in legislation.

The Alcazar Theater will revive "The
Danites" this week, .one of the few West
ern plays that have attained eminence.
It is by Joaquin Miller, and was adapted
to the stage by McKee Rankln, | who
played In the leading role for many years.
The story concerns itself with the Mor
mon Boclety, known as the "Destroying
Angels," a kind of organized vendetta,
with those who had put to death Joseph
Smith, the Mormon prophet, as victims.
The whole family was also marked for
the slaughter, and one only at | last sur
vives â a young girl who conies to Cali
fornia disguised as a miner. The Alca
zar company should find many welcome
opportunities in the play. .

There Is something of a history connect

of a devout body of worshipers who met

the most trying circumstances, for the
rain would come in and the draughts
would bluster through the cracks, and
other uninviting conditions tempted their
loyalty. From such a foundation has

TO HAVE A. BIO FAIIt
During the evening an excellent musical
programme was rendered. In which MlS3
Delvalle, Miss Sater, Miss Belle Rosen
thai, Rev. Cantor Solomon, Professor
Dellapiane and the choir . of the syna
gogue took part. Next Sunday evening
Rabbi Myers will lecture on "Judaism
and Paganism."
If Jews, Christians and Mohammedans could
only have known how much they had in com
mon none of these rings would ever have been
thrown Into the fierce fires of fanaticism and
hatred and forged into fetters of oppression
and persecution. Each of the rings ought
rather to be considered as links of the same
golden chain which at once unites the- owners
I to one - another as brothers on earth and to
their common father In heaven, until the time
shall arrive when the exclusive rings of all
sects will be melted in the sacred flames of
universal love.
I Thus the Jewish philosopher, Maimonldes, in
the twelfth century, though persecuted by Is
lam, said that the teachings of Christ and of
Mohammed tended to bring to perfection -all
mankind, so that they may serve God with one
consent. Similarly the great Jewish poet and
philosopher, Jehudah - Halevi, observed that
these religions are the preparation and | the
preface to the Messianic time, when all men
will be fruit of God's seed when they acknowl
edge him. and all become one mighty tree.
The German poet Leasing- typified these three
creeds In his famous apologue of the three
rings. The Judge advised each of the three
sons claiming to be in possession of the true
ring left by their father to be satisfied with
his own ring and to prove to the world that
in his ring he had the prize, its virtues being
shown to man in meekness, justice and mercy
to God in love and heartfelt trust.
Similarly he spoke in the highest terms
of praise of the noble doctrines taught in
the Koran. The three creeds by differ
ent methods, Judaism, by exercising un
paralleled patience, endurance and fidel
ity, the other two by active missionary
efforts, had been fulfilling their. common
mission to bring ultimately all mankind
into the pale of Monotheism, and univer
sal brotherhod. They harmoniously unit
ed In spreading: the light of religion and
the laws of love* among mankind, & light
emanating from the central sun, the faith
of Abraham, the first patriarch, the friend
of God, the, first true Moslem. In con
clusion, the speaker said: .1
Rabbi Myers paid a high compliment
to the self-sacrificing Christian mission
aries, especially the early Christians, who
in the pagan world overturned the altars
reeking with innocent blood, closed the
dens ot infamy and proclaimed the com
mon origin and universal brotherhood of
mankind, and referred to the wonderful
progress Christianity has made in the
world.
The moral teachings In the Hebrew Bible
were developed by the rabbis after the Baby
lonian exile into the grandest system of ethics,
based upon the law of universal love, which in
its broad outlines found its way subsequently
into the NÂ«w Testament. The sermon on the.
mount, for\ example, with one or two excep
tions, contains so many echoes of the sublime
sentiments expressed in the schools of the
Pharisees, just as what is called the "Lord's
Prayer" is but a compilation of phrases fovmd
in the Jewish liturgy and literature.. Chris
tianity, in a word, ia 'merely rabbinical Juda
ism nodifled to suit the sons' ot the Aryan
race, just as Mohammedanism may be re
garded as ' rabbinical Judaism adapted to the
requirements of the children of the desert and
the Orient.

"The Crown, the Cross and the Cres
cent" formed the subject of a lecture de
livered by Rabbi Isidore Myers in the
Bush-street Synagogue last night before
u large audience. Rabbi Myers'endeav
ored to shorr the origin, nature, achieve
ments and mission, as well as the jnutual
relationship of v Judatem, Christianity and
Mohammedanism, each claimingfto teach
a belief in one God, and to inculcate the
highest morality.' Rabbi Myers said:
Two Services Every Sunday.
Dr. George C. T Adams told of the satis
faction that the foundation of the church
in that district' had given, not alone to
himself, but to those with whom he was
closely, identified. He handed in some pro
ceeds cf a 'collection that he had made
that morning, and called upon those pres
ent tq- assist in even, now enlarging the
edifice by an addition of a room. The ap
peal was quickly responded to, donations
to the amount of $220 being given in with
in a few minutes.
Sunset Congregational Church- will have
two services every Sunday. The morning
exercises will be devoted entirely to Sun

Â¦who had built the church was worthy of
emulation. Though-it was a modest edi
fice they had the satisfaction to know that
they. owned it. >It had been built through
the fidelity of a few faithful souls. It was
always the few, . he said, that brought
about great changes in the workl. It was
the handful that'did the greatest things.
The Rev. W. C. Pond expressed the
gratitude he felt at being with that con
gregation on such an auspicious occasion.
He prophesied greater things for Sunset
Church than had even been achieved that
day. Â¦Â¦Â¦.Â¦' . i .

rell-street house to equal it in interest
"Every known law of gravity is defied,"
as the programme gayly announces, and
seemingly several other laws that are yet
unknown. The two performers spin
round the almost perpendicular sides of a
huge wooden cup at tremendous speed and
at all sorts of impossible angles." One of
them, this week does a disrobing act while
cycling In this dizzy fashion, to the signal
admiration of the audience. There is the
half-mile' race round this queer track,
done last night in 1 minute and 9 seconds,
that alone is worth the price, and various
other hair-raising stunts.
Josephine Sabel, another kind ot
"whirl," is also a strong favorite left over
from last week's bill. Miss Sabel has new
songs, new jokes and a new gown and her
audience is with her all the time.
A new act, one of the neatest and dain
tiest animal turns that have been seen
here, is that done by Reichen's dogs, a
miniature greyhound and a tiny fox ter
rier. They do some wonderful balancing.
Adelina Roattino, another newcomer, has
a pleasing voice and a repertoire that
ranges from | a coloratura waltz song to
"Listen to the Band." Tne Faust trio do
some good work in a stupid setting; Kelly
and Violette please in new songs, and the
Da Coma family closes another good bill
not forgetting the biograph.
If the California Theater is not kept
crowded during the week's run of "The
Pride of Jennico" it will be surprising.
Judging from the reception of the play
last night, it promises to be one of the
big drawing attractions of the year. The
playwrights. Abbey Sage Richardson and
prace Livingston Furness, have done ad
mirable dramatization from the stirring
novel of Agnes and Egerton Castle.
The story deals with love and intrigue
and gives the audience all the excite
ment of the orthodox melodrama, but
with royal and noble personages, baronet
hero and princely villain for characters.
A Princess changes places with another
fair dame that she may the more surely
win the man of her choice, Basil Jennico,
and confounds those who would compel
her to join hands with her hated suitor,
the Prince of Lusatia.
Basil Jennico is a valiant lover, just
the kind of gallant for whom the roman
tic maiden -would sigh and the matinee
girl pine. Xot that he is in any way
superior to any other mortal, but* the
playwrights have given Basil the rare
opportunity of fighting his way to gain
his bride with the aid of glittering sword
and stout knuckled fist.
Rarely has an audience been worked
up to such a pitch of excitement as
toward the end of the third act of this
unique play. Swords crossed, and men
fell, villains steeped in crime were wiped
off the earth's surface with realism that
almost brought the big house to its feet,
and when the curtain fell there were
plaudits such as are seldom heard in
these days of ultra-polite drama.
I And not only is "The Pride of Jennico",
an admirable play, but, what is Just as
important, the cast is admirable and,
more, there is a leading lady who is a
leading lady in the person of Miss Frances
Neilson, who reminds one of Maud Adams <
in appearance ana also in many ' of
those characteristics that are so charming
in the heroine of "The Little Minister."
Miss Neilson was a surprise. She Is emo
tional without the affectations which are
to-day too common in the stage heroine.
Miss Jseilson and "Wallace Worsley. the
Basil Jennico, shared the honors. The
company Is a large one in number and
also large In dramatic capacity. Brigands
and gypsies, guards and nobles meet in
deadly combat There are plots and
counter plots until the onlooker wonders
what can be the next sensation that is
to be served up. And with it all there are
no commonplace heroics or vulgar melo
dramatics. The -whole is so neatly nut to
gether that one never loses the atmos
phere of polite society, though there are
gypsies and other itinerant villains to deal
with. t
The scenery is excellent, the costumes
elaborate, and the whole production de
eep-lng of the unstinted applause it re
ceived last night. . â¢
Miss Viola Allen, an old San Francisco
favorite, and now a star of the first mag
nitude, will present "In the Palace of the
King" at the Columbia Theater this and
next week- The story of the play runs on
these lines:- â
Don John of Austria loves Dolores de Â¦ Men
doza, the daughter of the captain of the house
hold guards In his brother's palace. He goes
to the wars of Granada, and returns crowned
with laurels to meet his sweetheart. The
Kins opposes the match and plots to separate
the lovers. Dolores defies her father, and
Don John his brother the King-, and after sev
eral dramatic scenes the lovers finally triumph.
It Is said that Miss Allen nan never been pro
vided with a role which better suits her varied
powers than Dolores de Mendoza.
The actress is surrounded by a fine com
pany of over sixty people. The scenery
and costumes are described as being of
unusual splendor.

Several months ago a gasoline launch
belonging to Captain Wing- of Stockton
was stolen from its moorings at the Mill
City. .The efforts of the police failed to
locate either thieves or booty until a few
days ago, when the launch was discovered
at San Pedro. . It was brought up yester
day on the deck of the steam schooner
Acme, and will to-day be turned^over to
Captain Wing.

T. W. Bailey of CIO Mission street was
very drunk when he dropped into the Har
bor Hospital yesterday and asked Dr.
Pigglns to take: a stitch or two in a few
lacerated wounds he had accumulated on
his scalp. He refused to be stitched, how
ever,, when he .found .that, it would be
.necessary to have his head shaved ln the
vicinity of the various cuts. He found a
sunny lumber pile and was asleep when
Policeman Mullender ; discovered / him.
Will Enjoin the Hospital.
J. Johnson, cook on the towboat Reli
ance and for many years. jn the employ
of" the Spreckels Towboat Company, has
been missing since Friday evening and is
supposed to have been drowned. Johnson
was last seen about 8:30 o'clock Friday
evening, when he entered the Oceanic
dock and told the watchman at the gate
that he was going to turn in. He walked
away in the direction of the Reliance's
berth and has not been seen since. The
tide was low at the time, and to get on
board the tug Johnson would have had to
descend a ladder. It is supposed that he
lost his footing, fell into the bay and was
swept away by the tide. He was sober
when he bade good-night to the watch
man. â¢_ Â¦:,->.

Pirates at the Mail Dock.
Policeman Mackeyhad an exciting chase
yesterday morning after a â¢ boatload of
bay pirates, who were detected robbing a
barge alongside the Pacific ' Mail dock.
The pirates escaped up the Brannan-^treet
newer, and Mackey ruined his ' Sunday
uniform in the fruitless chase. When dis
turbed the thieves rowed their boat
under the wharf. Mackey chambered
down a pile Into another, craft
and followed. The. pirates' bafit was
long and narrow and they thoroughly un
derstood the intricacies of under-wharf
navigation. Mackey had selected a -big
boat, and his acquaintance with the Man
dock was confined to . the top side. He
managed to follow, however, and was in
hot pursuit, when the pirate -craft disap
peared in the mouth of the sewer. Mackey
followed, fired two shots and then estab
lished a blockade. While he was block
ading, however, the pirates were sculling
their boat to where the Brannan-street
sewer meets the sewer emptying at King
street. They escaped by way of the lat
ter exit.
THE new passenger steamship Spo
kane started yesterday on her
maiden voyage. She is bound for
Los Angeles, and carried much
freight and a large number of
passengers. The loss of the Walla Walla
hastened the commissioning of the Spo
kane, and she commences her business ca
reer without the glory of extended trial
trips, time being too precious for more
than a short spin around the bay. This
first trip, however, will combine all the
elements of a thorough trial. Robert For
syth of the Union Iron Works is on board
on behalf of the builders, and between
here and Los Angeles the Spokane will
be put through all her paces. Her speed
will be tested over the battleship course
in the Santa Barbara channel, and by the
time she returns to San Francisco the Pa
<inc Coast Steamship Company will know
all about the latest addition to the fleet. -
"I'll have an Injunction on them hos

telephone to Riordan." \
Bailey was taken away : in the patrol
wagon, but on the way to the police sta
tion a call was made at. the hospital,
where the (sleeping man was shorn, shaved
and stitched. When he awoke he asked
that a message be sent to his friend, Tom

when they took their departure on Satur
day night several million dollars' .worth
ot property had a narrow escape from de
struction by fire. The stove became red
hot, and when Special Policeman Fitzger
ald passed the place about 7 o'clock the
interior was ablaze. With the assistance
of tile proprietor of a near-by saloon and
some longshoremen the fire was confined
to . the little wooden building, and extin
guished by the time the department ar
rived. Piled on the wharves around this

CHICAGO. Feb. 2.â Albert Griffiths, the
Australian prize-fighter, best known as
"Young Griffo," was found to-day nearly
frozen to death ln a vacant lot with'ln
half a block of the Bridewell. Both hands
and feet were frozen, and physicians are
of the opinion that amputation of the
hands will be necessary.. Gtitto was for
many years a fistic marvel and was con
sidered a great fighter, one of the best
that ever donned boxing gloves. Of late
years Griffo has been leading a fast life
and was penniless. It Is thought he wan
dered toward the Bridewell in search of
food and shelter, as he was but recently
discharged from that Institution, where
he, had been serving a sentence for dis
orderly conduct .

with straw and a handful of dates, the

food, Ehrhorn collected the Insects along
the banks of Stevens Creek in this county.
They are technically known as hippo
damia convergens, a; variety common to
California, and. are particularly effective
ln the destruction* of plant lice. They
were assigned to Charles P. Lorensburg,
Government entonmologist at Cape Town.
On November 15 the. first lot of 15,000 was
shipped from here and Ehrhorn has just
received word that the bugs arrived in
good condition and have been distributed
in the orchards. So pleased were the South
Africans with the work of the insects
that they at once cabled for 40,000 more
.ladybugs, and this shipment is now on the
way there.
During the last' month Entomologist
Ehrhorn of this county has forwarded to
officials at Cape Town 55,000 ladybug^. and
requests have been received for another
lot of these gracefully formed "and deli
cately colored beetles.

By far the largest and most successful
tournament yet held on the park courts
was played yesterday. The players wera
divided Into two classes. When play 'was
called in the afternoon two men were left
ln each of the classes. In the first class
the. contestants in the finals will be
Charles Dunlap, the park champion, and â¢
Harry Routh. The second class men left
to play off are Alec Beyfuss and Judah.
The winner of the first class will allow
the winners of the second class odds of
"fifteen."
The finals of the tennis tournament for
the Davis cups, postponed from last Sun
day, resulted ln a victory yesterday for
the Smith brothers. Their opponents were
H. W. Crowell and "W. B. Collier, who al
lowed the victors a handicap of "half fif
teen." The match went four seta, the
score in favor of Smith and Smith being
6-1. 1-6, 10-8, C-4. The best work was dontf
by Chet Smith and Crowell, Grant Smith
and Collier being somewhat off in their
play.
This is the third consecutive time tho
brothers have won the cups. Collier and
Crowell have also won them three times
and they will undoubtedly go to one of
these teams permanently.

In summing up President Miller states
that if the Governor cannot see it his duty
to remove Regents Browne and Allen he
cannot longer, in justice to himself, the
1 State and . the students, remain as presi
dent of the school. The regents will this
week present their, side of the controversy
to the Governor.^ v . '
President Miller alleges that the affairs
of the institution have been managed by
the regents with a total disregard to his
ideas or wishes; that the regents have
held their meetings entirely at Spokane,
instead of at Cheney, as the law requires;
that they have appointed incompetent
teachers, some of whom are entirely un
necessary, and that ; these have been
chosen without consultation with the
president; as to their fitness; that the
re"gents have ordered repairs to the build
ing which were entirely, useless and un
necessary, and that in this matter and in
other ways the regents 'â¢ have wastefully
misapplied the appropriation made by the
Legislature fpr tho maintenance of the
Normal school.
TACOMA, Wash.. Feb. 2.â A difference
of long standing between President Miller,
of the Cheney State Normal School and
the regents of that institution has culmi
nated in an open fight and scandal which
must result in either the removal of two
of the regents from office or the resigna
tion of President Mifler.- The > matter is
now in the hands of Governor McBride,

The third evening levee of the season at

this occasion Mrs. Roosevelt appeared to
greater advantage than ever. Â¦ Aside from
The last festivities before Lent will be
without the presence of a most lovable
young matron, Mrs. L. H. Bryan. Next
Saturday Mrs. Bryan leaves for a six
weeks' visit to Mexico. She will.be tho
guest of her mother. Mrs. W. W. Fflton,
at Mazatlan. Mrs. Bryan will be accom
panied by her two children and "Miss
Mabel Toy and Miss Rowena Burns, who
anticipate a very pleasant trip.
Mrs. . W. H. Crocker has decided to re
call the invitations issued for the dance
at her residence on February 4 in honor
of Miss Elizabeth Sperry and also for the
large reception to have been held on Feb
ruary 8, this action being taken on ! ac
count of the serious illness of J. L. Sperry
of Oakland, an uncle of Mrs. Crocker.
The Crocker dance was a much-talked-of
affair and every one will be disappointed,
of course, but more- pained to know of
Mrs. Crocker's anxiety for Mr. Sperry,
whose death is hourly expected. Society
seems fated the present season to enjoy
but little of the hospitality of this fam
ily. Only recently Elsie Sperry. was com
pelled to cancel invitations for a Sunday
tea because her brother had pneumonia.
Miss Kathryn Robinson wore a plain
white brocaded satin gown, cut decollete,
with a bertha of rare oldpoint lace. The
simplicity of the gown -suited the occa
sion and rendered, the charming Kathryn
even more lovable . than everâ if you can
imagine such a thing. Miss Edith Pres
ton was radiantly beautiful in a spark
ling black Jet creation, which contrasted
with her hair. The effect was most strik
ing. Pearl Landers was a picture in her
gown of white spangled tulle. Kate Her
rin was irresistible in. her simple yet
elaborate gown of heavy cream lace over
white taffeta. It was cut princess and
fastened down the back, with showers of
chiffon flounces about the feet. Gladys
McClung was radiant and charming in
rose pink organdy.
It was a great pity that the flat went
forth not to costume for the bal poudre,
as some of the girls refused to see the
consistency of appearing ' in twentieth
century gowns with colonial dame heads,
but It was theirs not to make reply.
Therefore, the party gowns were looked
over and the most piquant one chosen.
And a picturesque assembly is was! Some
of the fair guests were gowned as simply
as their great-grandmothers would have
wished. Here and there an old but ever
new lace flchn about the shoulders en
hanced the beauty of the wearer and
corresponded happily with the style of
hairdressing.
The society buds who crowned their
beauty with powdered hair on .Wednes
day night are regretting that life is not
one long, delightful bal j poudre. There
will be no more longing to have their
hair "touched up" to approximate that
"stunning red," for the dear girls have
discovered that white hair is infinitely
mofe becoming than even their own.
They had heard, it is true, that white
hair softens the lines and gives to the
face a setting that , is gentle and pleas
ing, but the truth fully., dawned . upon
the debutantes on the eventful Wednes
day when they had fairly completed their
toilets and stood before their mirrors
studying the effects of the snowy locks
and tiny patches of black courtplaster.
Of course, the young men afterward con
firmed their ideas upon the subject and
since that happy evening the girls, who
heretofore insisted they did not want to
live to be old, are impatient for Dame
Time to give them white hair, as they
are quite sure that nothing else could so
effectively bring out their beauty.

It was subsequently learned that the

MAKES CHARGES
AGAINST REGENTS
The arrangements for the entertainment
are In the hands of a committee, which
has been .indefatigable in its efforts
toward the success of the affair. The
school is in need of financial assistance,
or, rather, the ladies feel that its work
eut Hies -the sisters of the convent .to.re
ceive some recognition of a special nature.:
Toward that end the , benefit has been
planned.
It is through the courtesy of a number
of talented amateurs of San Francisco
that the opera will be presented. The cast
will be comDOsed of those, who recently
gave the pretty and popular opera across
the bay. They have volunteered their
services in behalf of the Berkeley school.
The cast Is as follows:
Â¦ Richard, a pirate chief, Ed McGinty; Samuel,
ruary 10 at Shattuck Hall for the benefit
of the school of St. Joseph's Presentation
Convent. .
The only evidence against McCarthy
when arrested was his suspicious actions.'
When the detectives arrived on the scene
they followed the same clew and the con
fession to-day was due to the pressure
brought to bear on McCarthy, who was
confined In . the County Jail on a thirty
days* sentence for vagrancy.
GLENDIVE, Mont., Feb. 2.â Jerry Mc-
Carthy, who was arrested on suspicion of
Â¦being, implicated In the diamond .robbery
at Glendive January 19, when two trunks
belonging to S. H. Clausen & Co. r whole
saia jewelry manufacturers, were taken
from the Northern Pacific baggage-room,
broken open and diamonds to the value of
from $10,000 to $15,000 stolen, last night con
fessed to having stolen them himself.
This afternoon McCarthy was taken to
Terry, forty miles west of Glendive,
where he had cached the diamonds. They
were recovered intact.

Stage Manager Puts Up Bail for Or
pheum Artist Arrested for
Expectoration.
Harry Omdorff. stage manager of the
Orpheum, was obliged to part with $10
yesterday afternoon against his wilL
Shortly before the matinee an arrest was
made by police officers near the Orpheum
on O'Farrell street, the victim being a
typical Chinatown vagrant. While a
crowd was waiting the arrival of the
patrol wagon a member of the Da Corna
family of acrobats strolled up to see what
was going on. Da Coma expectorated
the sidewalk in the presence of a police
officer and to his astonishment found
himself under arrest.
The officer would not listen to Da
Coma's plea for freedom, and when he
insisted that he must be at the Orpheum
to do his turn the officer promised to al
low him to do a "turn" at police head
quarters.
Orndorff was informed of the trouble
and the matter was adjusted by the stage
manager putting up $5 bail and guaran- ,
teeing that Da Coma would appear this i
morning before Judge Fritz for trial.
When the Chinatown vagrant saw Da !
'"oma released he also urged that he had
to do a "turn" 1 at the Orpheum, and as j
the laugh was on Orndorff he put up an- '
YOher 55 for the vag's release and the pa- !
*rol wagon went away empty. Orndorff
m sure of Da Coma ' appearing in court,
put he has his doubts as to the appear
knee of the "Wandering Willie" in court
this morning.
HARBY ORNDOEFF COMES
TO ACROBAT'S RESCTFE
Judge Harrington, who has been active
ly engaged in the lynching case since last
June, is nearly worn out. The nervous
strain Is telling on his system and It is
surprising that he has not been compelled
to adjourn court for a season for rest. It
is only his iron constitution and great ner
vous energy that keeps him on the bench
as judicial officer in the case.
The strain is likewise telling on counsel
for the prosecution and the defense and
this great depletion of nervous force
doubtless is responsible for many ot. the
disgraceful scenes which have made the
case such a curious one In the annala of
California judicial proceedings.
ALTURAS, Feb. 2.â The usual Sunday
quiet has prevailed In Alturas to-day.
Judge Post of the Attorney General's of
fice stated to-night that he would not be
at all surprised if the fate of Jim Brown
was placed in the hands of the jury within
three weeks. It has practically been de
cided that no night sessions ot the court
will be held for the present.
Alturas Case Will Probably Be in
Jury's Hands in Three
Weeks.
JUDGE AND LAWYERS
ABE NOW VERY WEARY
The robbers entered the butcher shop of
Quast & Co. by a rear window and re
moved a 700-pound safe through the open
ing into the street. â¢ Â¦Â¦ .*
One man was left to guard it whHe- oth
ers, It is supposed,. went for a conveyance
to haul it away. William Ertle; formerly
town marshal, happened ; along during
their absence and the robber on guard
took a sbot at him.
Ertle pulled his gun and returned the
fire, and a lively fusillade followed. The
bullets flew wide -of their mark and the
robber turned and ran, escaping in the
darkness. The safe contained a large
sum of money. , â¢Â¦'..' Â¦ \ . , - â¢
AUBURN, Feb. 2.â A daring robbery
was attempted : at Â¦ Rocklin last night, but
was frustrated by the timely arrival of^ a
citizen. Â¦ , ".. v " Vi â¢"
Special Dispatch to'.The Call.
I make no attempt to excuse the railroads
for violating the law, but I insist that the
commission's attitude is inexcusable. - Of
fended because the courts overruled Us er-.
roneous assumptions of Dower in other direc
tions, it has been: sulking for yearsâ^-trying to
create the false impression that the act ia
worthless and seeking to use the rate cutting
which It couM and ought to have prevented as
a basis for demanding radical powers which
would in no way tend to correct it.
The commission seems to have made in
vestigations upon the cubject, not to enforce
the act. but simply to advertise it* contention
that the act is not enforceable. Moreover, no
part- of the new power now asked by the. com
mission would have the remotest tendency to
prevent this rate cutting, and this report
shows that this Is now the evil to be contend
ed with.
As an illustration of Its methods, it state*
in its last annual report that the courts have
held that to convict for paying a rebate it is
necessary to show not merely that the railroad
company paid a rebate to a particular ship
per, but- It. must also be shown that it did
'not pay the same rebate to> some other ship
per, which as a practical matter is almost
impossible. This statement la not true. The
very decision referred to distinctly holds that
the mere fact of paying a rebate from the,
tariff rate is in. itself an offense, regardless
of what was paid by anybody else and the
act makes this offense punishable by a fine
which -may be as much as $3000 for- each
Instance where the tariff rate i has been de
parted from.
The commission endeavors, as it has done.
for years, to excite support for its demand tor
more power by describing the prevalence of
secret rate cutting. . It* held new' Investigations
at Chicago and Kansas City to disclose con
ditions which it has known for years, delay
ins the publication of its report so as to give
the results of these hearings.
. The Indisputable fact must be kept befor*
the public -that the prevalence pf ratÂ© cutting
is an unanswerable argument airalnst giving
the commission more power, because it is due
principally to the commission's utter failure
to perform its manifest duty.
The paramount purpose -of the law vu to
secure publicity : and the maintenance of tariff
rates. . It IS the express duty of the commis
sion to keep advised and enforce the ' law. It
has the widest possible powers of investigation,
including the right to call for tfie production
of all . books, documents and papers, and It
can require the District Attorneys of thÂ»
United States to prosecute all violators. These
powers have been upheld by the courts. ThÂ»
commission, however, has not only failed to
devote its time and energy to discovering and
prosecuting violations of the law, but it haa
by It3 suDineness acquiesced In and encouraged
them and has done all In Its power to break
down the force of the act and make it a dead
letter by constantly proclaiming that - th*
courts bava made its enforcement Impossible,
whereas not a single decision has impaired
the commission's power ta prevent rate cut
tine. Â¦ . . .. .
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Feb. 2.-That the
Interstate Commerce Commission is â¢ It
self to blame for the rate-cutting which
it condemns in its last annual report is
the claim made by "Walker H. Hines. first
vice president of the Louisville and Nash
ville Railroad Company, in a pamphlet
that he has just Issued. Hines has given
special attention to thl3 subject in sub
stance as follows: .
Lawrence J. Dwyer, who died on Satur- j
&%T afternoon. Aubertin took an active
;>art in the formation of the Union Labor
party.
Tno selection of Aubertin was made on
Saturday night at a meeting held in the
headquarters of the Theatrical Mechanics*
Association at 113 OFarrell street. It was
stated at the meeting that none of the de
feated candidates on the Union Labor
party ticket who have demanded a re
count of the votes for Supervisor at the
last election would be appointed, as their
chances of winning seemed to be increas
ing every day. There was considerable
discussion as to the advisability of sug
gesting the name of any candidate at this
time, but the friends of Aubertin carried
the day.
The name of the" proposed candidate has
not yet been sent to Mayor Schmitz with
the recommendation of the committee,
but the Mayor was advised of the action
taken and is said to have declared him
self. He Is reported to have talked about
â¢Indecent haste" and made use of other
wtrong expressions, winding- up -with the
positive declaration that he would not ap
point Aubertin, but would act otherwise
upon his best Judgment.
Aubertin is at present holding a clerk
ship under Powel Fredrick, the Mayor's
appointee as clerk of the Justices' Court.
The salary attached to this position is the
same as that of Supervisor, but the Su
pervisorial billet is much more to be de
sired. This is doubly true as the status
of Fredrick has not yet been judicially
determined. Mayor Schmitz will probably
announce the name of the successor to
the late Supervisor in time for him to
nuallfy before the next meeting of the :
| !?oard after to-day.

cupying a prominent position as an offi
cer In Journeymen Barbers' Union No.

committee of the Union Labor party as its
candidate for Supervisor to succed the late
The party marched 14.000 versts. Topo
graphical Tsnryeysr were made, astronom
ical observations were taken in forty
places and meteorological observations
were conducted at Zaidam for fourteen
months. The transport of the collections
gathered by the expedition required the
use of fifty camels.
Three months were spent in making
collections of rare and hitherto unknown
animals.
xhe return journey was "begun in the
middle of March. The Chondo authori
ties sent guides and gifts for the Czar out
of gratitude to Captain Koseloff for re
maining, away from that place. On tho.ir
way the explorers were attacKed nv
Tangutes, but Russian rifles were vic
torious. The second attack was made
from an ambush. Captain Koseloff, how
ever, had expected it and sent part of his
men to fall upon the enemy's rear.
Through the influence of a L#ama of a
neighboring convent the Tangutes were
persuaded not to further molest the Rus
sians. The return to Zaidam was there
after without, danger. Kiachla (Siberi.i)
was reached by way of Urga (Mongol a)
in November. 1901.
Secure a Valuable Collection.
The population of the valleys are Tan
eutes. 'lhey live as nomads, following
ineir herds of cattle. Tiiey are warlike
and are armed with guns, sabers and
pikes. Another tribe, the Galyks, keep
nerds and raise wheat and barley on the
slopes. Their houses are two or three
stories in height and are built of clay and
stones. At a distance they look like small
towers. The Galyks feared reprisals for
the murder of the Frenchman, Dutreil do
Rhins. in 189G, which, they explained, was
due to his entering a temple.
Captain Koseloff reported that a strong
anti-British feeling prevailed among the
Thibetans. They gave the expedition no
trouble until, having crossed the Hoangho
and the Yang-tse, the explorers ap
proached the Mekong River, when the
natives declared the visitors must return.
Two hundred men fired from ambush as
the Russians were crossing the Dsa'Chu,
but the latter, by the use of their rifles,
drove them off after two hours' fighting.
Twenty natives were killed and seventeen
others' were wounded. Soon afterward,
an embassy .came from- Chondo to beg
Captain Koseloff not â¢ to go to that, the
second religious capital of the country.
The request was heeded. Captain Kose
loff remaining where he was until a por
tion of his company had explored east
ward to the Yang-tse.
Suddenly Attack the Party.
Captain Koseloff (who has been a mem
ber of an earlier exploring expedition to
Thibet), accompanied by Ladyguin, a lin
guist; Officer Jvaznakoir" and sixteen sol
diers, entered the desert of Gobi on the
eastern slope 'of the Altai Mountains, In
July, 1S99. The party traversed the des
ert in three columns. It was found that
the desert was not a plain, but was in
tersected by a chain of hills running from
northwest to southeast. The party re
assembled at fcinlli ana proceeded to Zai
oam, passing northward of the Koko-
Kor. .fart ot tire baggage was left under
guard of lour men in Zaidam. The ex
plorers quickly penetrated the Thibetan
Highlands, reaching a height of 17,000 feet
in a few days. 1'ne climate was severe,
but both vegetable and animal life were
found in plenty. Large herds or yaisa
and koulans <wild asses) and numerous
wild boars were met. Three skins equal
in size to skins of polar bears were
brought back.

HEAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
On Monday Hale, from the Committee
on Appropriations, will report the urgent
deficiency appropriation and ask to have
it considered or. the following day.' The
amendments in this bill providing for the
entertainment of Prince Henry and the
expenses of this country , incident to the
coronation may lead to some discussion,
but no doubt is entertained of the final
favorable disposition of those items.
The friends of the judicial salary bill
hope to conclude its consideration at a
comparatively early day. They say that
Senator Stewart's amendment increasing
the salaries of Senators and members of
Congress will be unceremoniously j voted
down. ' â¢
The friends of the oleomargarine bill
have no doubt of its passage.- They re
gard the vote on the adoption of the spe
cial order. last Friday as practically a
test vote. The bill is virtually the old
Grout bill,. imposing a tax of 10 cents a
pound on products colored, in imitation of
butter, and tr rr.afcc . retail dealers who
color oleomargarine subject to the same
penalties as the manufacturers.
For the most part the Senate will divide
its time this week between the Philippine
tariff biU and the bill increasing the sal
aries of members of the Federal judiciary.
The salary bill is in charge of Hoar. and
will be considered in the morning hour of
Â¦the Senate each Â¦ day until it is disposed
of, while the Philippine bill, which, is in
the hands of Lodge, will continue to have
the right of way as the unfinished busi
ness after 2 o'ciock each day. The salary
bill will be the subject of running debate
only, but a number of set speeches will
be made on the- other measure. Among
trie Senators who will be heard during
the week are Teller, Turner,' Carmack and
Culberson. /It is not probable that the de
bate on the Philippine bill will be con
cluded during the week.
The question of Cuban reciprocity is
likely lo be debated at length, as mem
bers of both sides of the House are anx
ious to. define"* their, positions.
WASHINGTON. D. C., 5 Fett.\ 2.-This
promises to be an interesting -week in. the
House. The oleomargarine bill has been
made 'a special continuing order for to
morrow and, after it is disposed of, which
it probably will be on Tuesday, the ; bill
for the repeal of the war revenue taxes
Â¦will fellow. : While both sides are unani
mous in favor of the repeal' of these taxes
it Is the intention of the Democrats to
open the. whole tariff question during the
debate on this bill and they will make a
strong fight for ample time for - discus
sion, il. , Â¦'.-'Â¦'Â¦Â¦ Â« â¢ >Â¦

their depredations to the coalyards along

Robert Swanson, a waiter, was knocked
down and run over by a car of the Sut
ter-street line on Polk and â¢ Jackson
streets last evening and narrowly escaped
being killed. Swanson was riding on tho
dummy of a northbound car. At the cor
ner of Jackson street the car came to a
standstill. Suddenly Swanson slid from
his seat to the street. A southbound car
was approaching and before, the gripman
could apply the brakes hard enough to
come to a stop his car was upon the pros
trate man, â¢ Â¦
The front part of -the dummy struck
Swanson and he was dragged a short dis
tance. Before the car was brought under
control the wheels of the- dummy had
passed "over Swanson's right hand. The
victim was extricated from his position
and sent to the Central Emergency Hos
pital in the North End patrol wagon. Dr.
Murphy examined the injured man and
found that besides having his right hand
badly crushed he was suffering from se
vere contusions of the hips and a lacer
ated scalp.
The patient's injuries demanded that
part of the wounded hand be' amputated,
but Swanson, who was considerably under
the influence of liquor, refused to allow
the operation to be performed. Dr. Mur
phy dressed the wound and had Swanson
put to bed. J. L. Payne, the gripman of
the car which ran over Swanson, was ar
rested 1 by Police Officer Mangan and
charged with battery.
George Dunn,, residing at 169 Minna
street, was knocked down by. an electric
car at New Montgomery and Mission
streets last night.
An elderly woman, accompanied by a
young man, called at the Central Emer
gency Hospital early last evening to be
treated for a slight bullet wound on tho
face. The woman declared her wound to
be the result of an . accident. She said
that a friend | of hers was handling a
small pistol in her room when the weapon
was accidentally discharged and the bul
let struck her on the face. The woman
refused to make any further statement,
and after being treated left the hospital.
She gave the name or Mrs. Wilson and
her residence as Seventeenth and Guer
rero streets, but hinted that both were
fictitious. Â¦ â < Â¦ . .
