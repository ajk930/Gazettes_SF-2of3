LOS ANGELES, Jan. 9.â A man who
claims that his name Is : Martin McDer
mott and that he was discharged from
the Agnew Asylum on December 30 has
complained to the police that he has been
robbed of $340 by an unknown man. Mc-
Dermott says that -he bought a ticket
Monday at San Jose for his home at Sher
brooke, Canada, and bought also a draft
for $300 on his -home bank. He arrived In
Los Angeles Tuesday evening, and, in
searching for a lodging-house, fell into
the hands of a stranger, -who. he alleges,
robbed him of $40 in coin and the draft
for $300. The man can give no clew to the
identity of the thief, and is evidently un
balanced by â¢ his misfortune. He will be
cared for by the police and will probably
be returned to Agnew.

PORT TOWNSEND, Wash.. Jan. , &.â
Evidences of an atrocious crime came to
light Monday, when the nude body of a
man was found on the beach, near Fort
Casey, on Whidby Island. According to
the information received, the head had
been severed from the body by a sharp
instrument; both hands had been cut off
and the body. was otherwise mutilated.
From appearances the crime was re
cently committed. The only means by
which the body can be identified is a
crucifix of Christ tattooed on the right
arm above the elbow, and the. letters
"I. N. R- 1." tattooed in blue and red. Thus
far the body has not been identified. The
severed head is missing.

build the canal, or was there to be one j

Hepburn Answers Criticisms. * v c |
; Hepburn answered the criticisms' -, ad
duced against the bill during the * debate, 1
devoting much time to Cannon. The gen
tleman from Illinois, he ..said., demanded
clearness and definiteness, yet- he pur
posed to support the Morris, amendment,
which Hepburn pointed out was vague
and indefinite. He had imputed bad mo
tives to no one, but he believed that
forces were working for delay*
"I do not impugn Â¦ the motives of the
gentleman from Illinois," said he, "when
he says he is in favor of this canal. In
a parliamentary sense. I am convinced,
yet I am free to confess that only the
obligations- of parliamentary law would
convince me when I remember that Â¦ he
was invariably a stickler for delay."
Hepburn then proceeded to review Can
non's record on canal legislation to show
that his declaration of friendship did not
harmonize with his constant course of
hostility. He repeatedly drew applause
and laughter as he launched his shafts of
sarcasm at the chairman of the Appro
priations Committee. Cannon seemed to
take it all good naturedly, joining In the
laughter provoked at nis own expense.
Hepburn said that Cannon posed as a
business man, yet said he wanted to pav
$40,000,000 for something the commission
said was worth $27,000,000. With regard
to the alleged claims of the Maritime Ca
nal Company, which the gentleman from
Illinois discovered In the "pale moon
light," the commission reported that they
had already been extinguished.
In conclusion . Hepburn said it was his
opinion that the House should assist 'the
pending bill. He did not pretend â¢ that it
was as perfect as it would have been had
It been drawn by the gentleman .from Illi-"
nols. with his fund of inexhaustible wis
dom. :..-â¢. ;Â¦:.Â¦
Addressing the Democratic side, he read
the plank in the .Kansas City platform
pledging the party to the Nlcaraguan ca
nal.
"That," said he, amid laughter/ ". is In
my opinion the most respectable declara-'
tion in x the platform." ,.,..,.,.; v . !
"There are reports in the ''air," said :
he, "that any isthmian bill : will .have a '
rough and rocky road to. travel in,-an-^
crher body; that the sentiment of certain 1
persons of potency is against "it. .What,

DEATH ENTERS
AT A BANQUET
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Jan. 9.
âThe steamer Topeka, , from the
north, this morning brought the
survivors of the wrecked steamer
Bristol, which on ; the night of
January 2 struck the Gray Island Reef,
â¢off Gundes Island, near IJlxon Entrance.
On board the Topeka were twenty-one
survivors of the crew of twenty-eight.
Among the survivors was Chief Officer W.
Smith, who gives the following account of
the wreck: . y ,", . ' â¢ .
. "The Bristol sailed^from Ladysmith De
cember 81 with 2100 tons of coal for the
Treadwell mine/ on Douglass Island, and
during the voyage ! a strong southeast
wind prevailed.. Everything went well
until the i night ; of January 2, when the
.weather set in thick; with a high sea run
ning, and at: 2 a.-m. the reef was struck.
."The boats %were immediately 'lowered
and kept in readiness on the port side. All
hands. remained by the ship. until 6 a. m.,
when she careened to starboard and shook,
heavily, indicating that she was about to
go to pieces or slide off.* Captain Mclntyre
ordered all hands to the boats.
"The first boat to get away was lifeboat
No. 4, with fourteen men, in charge of
Second Officer Horgen. No. 2 was next,
with four men, in charge of Third Officer
D. O. White. Chief Officer Smith was
washed overboard by a high sea, but waa
picked . up.- ' These boats were carried at
the mercy of the: wind and waves in a
northwesterly direction.' :

the Russian Minister at Seoul has been
granted a concession for the construction
of a telegraph line from Seoul to Kyong.
whence it will be extended to Vladivos
tok. This will bring Korea into direct

control. of all the telegrams in Manchuria
and will not permit the sending of code
messages or Chinese telegrams not trans

Takeya, one of the managers of the
Commercial Exchange, is accused of em
bezzling 100,000 yen, which he secured by
converting a quantity of securities placed
in his charge and using the proceeds for
private purposes. They consisted chiefly
of bonds deposited with the exchange by
brokers as security. Takeya la the son
of Viscount Takeya and his surety was
Count Hirohashi, but the latter recently
withdrew because Takeya. was living ex

Closing Debate on. Measure.'
In Anticipation of â¢ a vote on the. Nica
raguan canal bill there was a large at
tendance on the floor when the House
met Under the order made yesterday
the general debate was to close at 2
o'clock, when the bill was to be read for
amendment under Â£>e five-minute rule.
Adarr.son of Georgia, the first speaker
to-day, urged the passage of the Hep
burn bill without amendment. He argued
that the time had come for action and
that equivocation now could only result
in delaying the commencement of the
canal. If the Panama Canal Company
had an offer to make .which we would
accept, he said, there would" be - time
enough to take advantage of it when the
bill was pending in the Senate or later
in conference.
Wooten of Texas also argued that the
bill should be- passed without amendment.
He regarded the Morris amendment as a
modern Trojan horse.
Wooten said be did not favor an amend
ment to fortify the canal. He believed
such an amendment savored more of spu
rious sentiment than sound arid.salu
tary sense. He favored a neutral cannl.
At this point, upon the ' request of Da
vis of Florida, the time for general debate
was extended until 2:30 p. m.
Sparkman of Florida spoke in favor of
the Hepburn bill.
Cannon of Illinois, chairman of the Ap
propriations Committee, then took the
floor. Cannon's remarks were given close
attention. The building of this canal, he
taid, was. a business proposition and
should be considered from a business
standpoint. Gentlemen talked about this
proposed canal, having been "agitated for
400 years, and used that as an argument
why members of Congress should fall
over each other to vote for -the pending
bill. Personally he had favored a canal
for years, but because he had not been
willing to> proceed without information
and against fixed treaty laws be had been
called hard names. . - ,.
Cannon at this point clashed sharply
with Hepburn, who is-.in eharge of the
bill. When Hepburn made some quick
reply to a criticism of Cannon the latter
observed amid laughter that â¢ if Â¦ the gen
tleman from Iowa were only as straight
Â¦ forward as he was /'flip of tongue" he
would be a better legislator. \-
Bepresentative Cannon's Views.
Cannon, discussing the language, of the
bill, a&ked what was meant by authoriz
ing the President to "obtain full control
* over the land upon which the canal -was
to be built."" Did it mean the purchase
and ownership of miles of property owned
by speculators, both American and Nic
araguan? \ With great emphasis Cannon
declared that in his Judgment the general
appropriation which â¢ the bill , contained
and "artful language" of it would cause
the claim that it gave the President full
power not only to pay Nicaragua and
Costa. Rica, but the Maritime Canal Com
pany and European. American and Nica
raguan speculatorsâ how much he could
not tell. It might be five, ten or twenty
five, millions. He denounced what he
termed the undue haste of ; those â¢ who
want to build this canal "between * now
and' sunrise to-morrow." - He also ob
jected to the authorization . the bill con
tained to negotiate . contracts for the
whole works. Cannon said he would vote
for the Morris amendment, and If it
failed he would move to recommit Â¦ the
bill with amendments he had suggested
De Armond of Missouri said the ques
tion before the American people was not
as to whether Congress would pass a bill
for the Isthmian canal, but . whether .the
bill would be , matured and proper when
parsed. If confidence existed in the Pres
ident, why should he not be given the op
portunity to negotiate with , Colombia or
Nicaragua; according to the information '
in his possession? Alternative- authority
should enable him to make better terms.
Experts differed as to the - advantages
of the two routes. Why not give.. the
President the discretion" to select? No
risk would be Involved in it. The bill, he
ritory to direct the ; Secretary of War
to construct such a canal from the Carib
bean Sea at a point near Greytown, in
Nicaragua, by way of Lake Nicaragua, to
a point on the Pacific Ocean near Brito,
and also to construct proper harbors at
the termini of said canal and to make
necessary provisions for the defense sjf
the canal and harbors.
Sections 3 and 4 authorize the President
to make such surveys as may be neces
sary and to employ such persons in con
structing the canal. as may to. him seem
wise, and Â¦ directs that in the construc
tion of the canal the River San Juan ard
Lake Nicaragua .shall J?e used -as far as
they are .available. ; "Â¦'. --
.Section 5 authorizes the President to
guarantee to the state of Costa Rica ar.d
Nicaragua the use of the canal and har
bors upon terms to be agreed upon for
vessels owned by citizens thereof.
The last section makes a present ap
propriation of $10,000,000 to carry on this
work, and authorizes the Secretary of
IVar to enter into proper contracts for
material and work as may be' deemed
necessary -therefor, such -work and mate
rial to be paid f qr as appropriations may

VICTORIA, B. C. Jan. 9.â The steamer
Queen City, which returned this evening
from Ahousett and way ports on the
Vancouver Island coast, ' brought more
news of wreckage. At two ports, at which
she called yesterday news was given to
her officers, meager but alarming,: of a
vessel which had drifted into the . coast,
bottom up.
This latest victim of recent storms was
unidentified, and all -that was learned is
that she was some three-masted schoon
er, evidently one of the . fleet of lumber
carriers. The news of the derelict was
hrst learned at Cloose, when the steamer'
called there yesteraay. , The Rev. Mr.
Stone, whose wife, by the way, found, the
name board of the lost bark Dominion
on the beach at Cloose a few years ago,'
reported that Indians had come in after
righting the .derelict of some large ves- I
sel which had turned turtle.; No particu- j
lars were learned which would render her
identification possible/-. -;.-V ; '-i)
Later in the day, when the steamer
reached -San I Juan,\ Indians came in, and i
leported having seen the wrecked , vessel I
floating not far from Carmanah-'; Point;
yesterday, afternoon. The Indians had
gone off to the derelict,'.' but could "give
l.o detailed information bearing upon the
unfortunate vessel. What, vessel it is re
mains a mystery for the present. There
IS no clew whatever to her identity. .
The lighthouse keeper at Carmanah,
whose sons had found so much wreckage
along the coast between Carmanah and
Nltinat, had returned a short time before
the steamer left for a journey along the
coast line to Ponilla Point and reported
that wreckage of various kinds, runidenti
fiable, had been seen in. the sea along
that part of the coast.
The brigantine Blakeley, which sailed
from Victoria on Monday, carrying an
other expedition to Cocos Island, had a
narrow â¢ escape front being wrecked at
San Juan yesterday, according tu news
brought by the steamer Queen City. The
gold-seeking brigantine put back to San

while there , her anchors began to drag

her in dangerous 'proximity to the rocks.
Her anchors held eventually, and she

U First ttreet, San Fr*nclÂ»cÂ«At the doorway of the Blankart home
stood Mrs. Funston, proudly holding the
boy in her arms, and the welcome home
was full of happiness that all was well
with the mother and the little new-comer.
Mrs. Funston was aglow with pleasure
when she presented the child to her fam
ous husband. Everything else was in the
background but that meeting. For the
first time the soldier gazed upon his little
son's fac<J and that was enough "to com
pensate for the. days of anxiety . he had
undergone since he parted from his wife
at Manila months ago.
At the home to-night they had not made
many plans for the future. As soon as the
prevalent scarlet fever has subsided - in
East Oakland there will be a. christening
at the Church. The little one. is* to '-have
the name of his father, Frederick. That
is Mrs. Funston's desire, and her hus
band in this case must defer to her wish.'
.Mrs. Funston says that the general has
not fully recovered from appendicitis and
he will remain here until he -Is well and
strong. After that General Funston will
go to Washington to pay his respects to
the President and to the War Depart
ment officials. Then he expects to return
to Manila and to take Mrs. Funston and
Frederick Jr. with him. ,
OAKLAND, Jan. 9.^-Greeted by his
wife with their baby boy, three weeks
old to-day, in her arms, General Fred
erick Funston arrived this evening at
the residence, 1319 Tenth avenue, of Mrs.
Otto Blaakart, where- the homecoming
was made doubly joyful by reason of the
son and heir that had. come to the dash
ing soldier while he was on the seas
homeward bound. The man of battle was

was given him at the transport that 'a
male child had been born to his wife.

â¢ "After a weary march we arrived at
Palon, where our man was located. We
found him in a but such as all the na
tives lived in and when I pounced on him
and made him a prisoner of war he looked
chagrined and surprised. In all my life
I never .saw such a look of absolute sur
prise and abject misery come over a
man's face. He simply couldn't under
stand It and seemed for the time being
quite dazed. We hustled him out of the
hut and incidentally out of town quickly
and took up our homeward march in a
hurry.
"We had captured a man whose name
struck terror to the heart of every na
tive on %he islands and we did not want
to lose him. Until I had Mr. Aguinaldo
safely landed behind the American lines
I did not feel easy. As a foe Aguinaldo
was a big man, but as a prisoner his per
sonal importance faded in my eyes. He
seemed to be a. bright man, but there was
nothing in his outward appearance which
would indicate that he was the fighting
chief of the Filipino nation.
"1 had him under my charge for only
four days, and in that time you see I
could get but a meager idea of the range
of his mentality. He was not a. bit surly,
rather pleasant on the contrary, for a
man in his position. He was almost ab
solutely non-committal, however. He talk
ed only on such matters as were abso
lutely nttcessary for his personal comfort.
On the (subject of his past actions or the
schemes of his government he would have
nothing to say. He acted as a man who
realized he was caught like a rat in a
trap and the less he said the better it
would be for him. It was very difficult
to get anything out of him.
"Ayuinaldo. I believe, would just as
Aguinaldo Was Dumfounded.
"I cautioned the scouts to keep a 6tlll
tongue and I spent most of my time
watching them. In fact, all of the other
officers with me kept strict watch over
them and whenever danger of our pur
pose being disclosed was imminent we all
added additional endeavors to keep the
native scouts quiet.
"No, it was not treachery I was afraid
of; it was indiscretion. I was not afraM
that the native scouts would lead myself
and comrades into some place where we
would be ambushed and slaughtered or
taken prisoners, but I was in mortal fear
that some one of them would unthink
ingly betray the object of our trip to an
enemy who would hasten to warn Agul
raldo. .
"The average Filipino, or rather the
majority of them, are as cunning as cats
and as treacherous as rattlesnakes. They
will betray a person with as good- grace
as if they were making him a present,
but the natives I had with me on the
march to Palon. where Aguinaldo was in
hiding, were men in whom I had confi
dence. -

the idea of trusting ourselves in the in

tant step in the suppression of the rebel
lion with a band of natives.

It is understood that assurances as to
the position of the United States Govern
ment respecting the enforcement of for
eign claims against Venezuela all have
been predicated upon the very clear and
concise statement of President Roosevelt
In his first message to Congress. It has
been mads clear to all inquirers that the
main purjiose of the United States is that
there snail be no extension of European
sovereignty in America, but within that
line there is not likely to be any interfer
ence on our part. The United States itself
is interested through a number of its citi
zens in claims somewhat similar to those
urged by Germany and France. Claim
ants have arisen in different parts of the
United States since the German opening of
this Question and are insisting that the
State Department press their claims just
as Germany and France are about to do
for their citizens. The matter is under
consideration, but there is no disposition
to hasten unduly, as it is realized that the
situation in Venezuela may change sud
denly through internal Influences.

COLON, Colombia, Jan. 9.â The authori
ties at Washington have consented to the
request of General Carlos Alban, the Mil
itary Governor of this district, that the
United States cruiser Philadelphia proceed
to Las Tablas, conveying the Colombian
commissioners who are to arrange for an
exchange of prisoners between the Colom
bian government and the Liberals. Las
Tablas is about 120 miles southwest of
Panama, and the Philadelphia will sail
thence this afternoon. Recent arrivals at
Panama say that the Colombian General
Castro is near Pese, Eouthwest of Pana

and that the Liberal leader. General Her

troops as a free man. At least so his
friends claim. Aguinaldo caused the as
sassination of General Luna, an insur
gent, and the latter's three brothers, who
have worked up a large and powerful fol
lowing since Agulnaldo's capture, have
sworn a feud against him. They intend
to murder him the first time they get a
chance. Aguinaldo's friends have warned
him against the Luna faction and he be
lieves that. if he is set free his enemies
will carry out their threats to kill him.
Â¦While he still has many friends among
the insurgents, there are many whom he
injured or refused to favor during hl3
reign who are now arrayed against him.
He fears that if he were released these
men would put him out of the way.

I have the honor to communicate to your
Excellency that the Minister of Chile in Buenos
Ayres presented yesterday to this department a
note of the protocol about policies in the same

ment. With this explanation all the incidents

Minister ot Foreign Affairs.
SANTIAGO r>E CHILE, Jan. 9.â There
is no truth in the report from Valparaiso
that a Cabinet crisis is impending owing
to the explanatory, note which was sent
by Chile to the Argentine Government In
order to make the arbitration protocol ac
ceptable. â¢ '
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.â Garcia Merou,
Argentine Minister in Washington, has
just received the following cablegram
from his Government: ; '
Report of an Impending Crisis in
Chile Is Denied.
CABINET WILIi NOT BESIGN.
While the Pan- American . Congress re
fuses to entertain the creation of a spe
cial court of claims, it Is thought there
is some prospect of its adhering to this
latest proposal. This special use of The
Hague tribunal will be independent of a
voluntary agreement to appeal to it for
purposes of general arbitration.
Owing to the firm attitude taken by the
delegation:; who are favorable to the
compulsory plan of arbitration, it is prob
able that the plan in question will be re
ported to the conference in the regular
form and recorded in the final protocol,
just in the same way as other acts of
tne conference. If this course is adopted
the Chileans will have to decide whether
or not they will carry out their threat of
withdrawing from the conference. But if
it is not followed it is practically sure
that the Peruvians, Argentinans, Bolivi
ans, Guatemalans and Paraguayans will
withdraw, and probably also the Uru
guayan delegation. Therefore, It' is a
choice between the departure of one dele
gation or several.
There has been so much discussion of
arbitration of late that the project for a
court of claims has been going forward
on that project and satisfactory progress
is reported. It is proposed that instead
of establishing a political court of claims
among the American nations, the latter
shall sign a convention entailing the obli
gation of appealing to The Hague court
in any . controversy involving pecuniary
damages, provided such claims cannot be
arranged diplomatically and all legal re
sources have been exhausted in pressing
them. Â¦ *
CITY OF MEXICO, Jan. 9.â The mem
orandum of Chileans threatening to
'withdraw from the Pan-American con
ference, whatever might be the form in
which the plan of compulsory arbitration
was presented, was delivered to Finance
Minister Limantour, who has been carry
ing on the negotiations on behalf of the
Mexican Government, and to W. I. Bu
chanan of the United States delegation.
In their interview with the President the
Chilean delegates not only threatened to
withdraw their legation here, if they had

tion, but put it in the form that the Min
iser would ask for his passports, so it is

While EnfbaYsador Cambon has made no
representations on the subject to Secre
tar^ Hav. it is known that the French
Government has followed with keen at
tentlonthe developments In the German-
Venezuelan dispute and fully understands
the attitude of the United States in such
matters. The authorities have not ex-
Sected thsu France would co-operate with
Germany in compelling Venezuela to sat
isfy international claims, but have rather
been of the opinion that she would wait
until the <3erman bill had been paid, when
she would make a naval demonstration-
Following France it may be that Great
Britain, whose subjects hold claims
jipainst the South American republic, will
'-equire the Venezuelan Government to
settle with them. Whether these various
naval demonstrations will occur will de
pend upor. the result of the revolution. If
Castro be overthrown the new Govern
ment will undoubtedly be glad to make a
peaceful surangement whereby the dif
ficulties with foreign Governments will be
settled.
"The reported revolt at Bogota and the
imprisonment of President Marroquin are
both untrue. The source of Information
In Managua cannot be trusted."
When General Alban was questioned to
day concerning the statement i In a dis
patch from Managua, received in the
United States yesterday, to the effect that
a revolt had broken out in Bogota and
that the President of Colombia had been
Imprisoned, he said:
of the Chilean navy, who are on the way
to Europe to man the warship recently
purchased abroad by Chile.
On examination, the Pacific Steam Nav
igation Company's steamer Chirique,
which the Colombian Government pro
posed to charter for Government service,
proves to "be unable to stand the vibra
tions resulting from cannon firing. Con
sequently, if the Colombian gunboat Gen
eral Pinzon, which has on board tfte
guns -which were destined for use on t"Be
Chirique arrive at Colon shortly . the Co
lombian Government will endeavor to ob

"Did you notice a hole In the steamer
after the collision?"
"Yes, sir; I did."
Joseph Darragade, an able seaman* on
the. Max. who was In charge of. the wheet
at the time of the collision, was next
called. He proved to be an excitable wit
ness. He testified as though he was call
ing to his mates in a heavy thunder
storm. He became so excited that he fre
quently contradicted hrmself. He seemed
to misunderstand the questions put to him
by the Interpreter and -this . led to many
wrangles between the Inspectors, witness
'and Interpreter.

ordered th$ course changed before the col
lision, then stated that he heard the cap

"C& the forecastle head," replied -the
Eugene Le Doriol, an 18-year-old appren
tice on- the Max, was the nexv witness.
When It was learned that he had* been tha
lookout on. the morning of the collision,
Â¦ surprise was eTlnced by those i present.
He ftafd "hÂ» --was a. ltttte hSKfcer th#n aja
apptentice and had been at sea five and-a
half-years. He said he had been on^the
Max four months. He testified that he
was on the lookout and had been so for
an hour. He had gone on duty at mid
night. He stood next the green light.- The
weather was clear and a small breeze was
blowing. He said be could steer, but waa
seldom given an opportunity. '
He said he called attention to the lights
by ringing the btfll. This bell Is to call
the mate's attention that something was
In the vessel's path. He said there wa3 a
rule In the French navy that one. bell
was to announce there was a light on the
starboard, two bells for port and . three
â¢ bells for one in front. He said he rang
the bell once and never lost sight of the
lights of the steamer. He told the number
of lights he had seen. ...
The witness testified that when tha
steamer was, within twenty meters of the
Max she turned on her course. Had she
not done so she would have struck the
bark amidships. He said the shock of the
collision was great, but he kept from fall-
Ins by holding- on to the capstan.

Cantata Hall, .

I could not distinguish, whether it was a
whistle or not." .

the time of the collision the witness said
he could see people emerging from the
cabin or the Walla Walla. . He said the
nioment the. Max was struck the steamer
backed up and away; that torches were
lit at . his orders, which was a signal for
help. He said they did not know what
vessel was hurt the most. Ignace claimed
that the ; Max was moving so slowly that
it was impossible for her to run Into the
steamer. - Â¦ â¢ â¢ â¢ Â¦
Captain Hall was Invited to ask ques
tions and he Interrogated Ignace as fol
lows:' â¢ . â¢ â¢
"I would Hike to ask you if you eaw
our red light."
"I did," replied the' witness, "but I
never saw your green light.",
"What . was the force of the wind at
the time of the' collision?" asked Second
Officer ,'Lupp. . . -..
"There was a small breeze and a heavy
sea." Â¦ â¢ '. Â¦ Â¦
"Were the sails full or flabby aralnst
the mast?" asked Bulger. - a ** 4il3t
- "They were full. We steered as close
a s we Â¦ could Â¦ to have the sails full."
"If- the -wheel had â¢ been hard aport.
would the Max have turned quickly "
asked the inspector. . ' .
! "No, sir," answered "the witness. "She
Â¦would have turned very slowly."
. "Did you ever lose sight of the steam
er's light after you first saw her?"
"Yes, the heavy smoko obscured it at
times." . ....
."Then how was It you knew the steam
er was heading directly toward you?"
"I saw the smoke getting: nearer and I
knew the steamer was approaching"
.A'Then why -didn't you ; change your
course?" asked Bulger.
."I knew very, well the steamer was
coming toward, us, but . I- could not"' tell
' "There was oil enough In them to make
them burn I twenty-four hours. I knew
they. were burning. brightly because I had
occasion to go forward when I saw the
Mendocino light. ; At 8 o'clock the next
morning they were still burning brightly.
We were steering by the wind, which was
blowing south-southeast. - ThG weather
was .clear and you could see the moon
overhead every little while." .
An adjournment, was taken at this
P. 01 "*. but Ignace was recalled to . the
sion a^ â¢ opening of. the afternoon ses-
He said the ship was going at the. rate
of two -miles an Hour. The: vessel was
steering well and had been on her tack
since 8 o'clock the night . before. He
claimed, he saw the Mendocino light be
fore the accident. It was bearing east
southeast. The ; witness contradicted
himself as to when he sawthe light, and
Inspector Bulger called for thÂ© log book.
This was_ brought in by. Captain Benoist,
who, further; testified. -. .- . Â¦,
Log-. Book Entries. .
v Captain Benoist said he took his longi
tude from â¢ Paris and he ; used French
charts of this coast, and that he kept his
logbook frpm noon to noon. . The inter
preter then read the following from the
4<>Â£ o* -the -day; of th<? col ,, slon \ . u^
Â¦Heavy sea; strong breeze: clear:
foggy; changeable from . south to south
east; clear again: sails set at 3:25; saw
the light of Mendoclno at 4 o'clock; col
lision took, place with ..steamer going
west; from 4 to 12 the. ship was hove to "
.â¢ Tire captain said : the foregoing entries
were made Â©very four hours. Ignace was
then. taken Jn = hand and questioned fur-
Jtor.-v ; He said that after the collision
half the. crew got the lifeboats ready and
the other/; half worked hard to stop the
never thought of the danger of this kind
and therefore went below to put on some
clothes. This was about fifteen minutes
before the collision. When I wa3 on deck
1 taw the red light of the steamer and
the white headlight and the lights of her
cabin." w â¢ '
"Was anything- done on ..the bark to
avoid a collision; was the course
changed?" asked Captain Bulger.
"The course, was hot changed," an
swered the witness.
Continuing, Captain Benoist said:
"The ship was staying by the wind.
After . the collision occurred I had the
ship turn about and lay to. We heard
no signal or hail from the steamer's
crew." . â¢ . . â¢Â¦-. Â¦
The witness then showed by diagrams
the position of the two vesrel3 before the
accident and how they separated after
ward.-
"How far anart were the vessels when
you first saw, the lights?" asked Inspector
Bulger. Â¦ â¢Â¦ - ' v -
â¢"I could not- say. but I think three or
four Â¦ miles. I think the steamer i could
have easily avoided the accident" . ...
"After the collision did you. know you
cut f into the -hold of the steamer?"
"Yes, sir."
i . Did Not Launch Boats. Â¦:'/
"Were you not in a position. to launch
your boats?"
"Yes. Sir."
"Why didn't you do so?"
"We were too busy with our own boat.'.'
'."Why didn't you come to a standstill
where you struck the steamer.'* Â¦
"I stayed there -until noon. I did- not
think the Walla Walla was very badly in
jured. Our forepeak was full of water,
but abaft that there was very little water.
We pumped* it out .by means of a. donkey
after the collision?'/ said Lupp, address
ing the witness. : ;
"I did.' They- were burning brightly,"
answered Captain Benoist. *
"What time were the lights put .but
the night before?" . â¢;;> . :
. "At sunset." Â¦ '"' â¢"-.'Â¦
First Mate's Story.
.. Emile Ignace, first mate of the Max,
who was in command at the time oftho
collision,' was next, called to the stand,
and his testimony, corroborated that of
his superior officer. The witness testified
that he did not hold a certincato as;flrst
mate, as the French law did not require
it. Without many preliminary questions
he made- the following statement:
"At 3 o'clock on the morning of the col
lision I saw the light on Cape Mendocino.
Five minutes later I â¢: saw the lights of
the steamer. I called Captain , Benoist
and told hitn.I saw the Mendoclno light.
He I then 1 came on deck. I - then showed
him the lights of the steamer. The steam
er's ' lights were obscured by the --thick
smoke that poured from her funnels. -The
cap.tain' remained- on the poop and I.went
below: to. give necessary orders to navi
gate the ship, i While > I Â¦ was giving or
ders ..the ; steamer continued to ; approach.
I ran to- the captain and told ; him that
the steamer was getting too close. -
'.'The collision .took place on- the fora
part of the Max on the starboard iside.
We did everything: we. could to ( save, the
ship. } â¢ The captain's . room Â¦ is Â¦ on the : poop
deck and he had -gone In. there tochango
his Â¦'. clothes. The first : time I -saw the
steamer.it was at an angle of 45 degrees.
She seemed: to Â¦ continue â¢,â¢ on â¢ her \ course."
The thick, smoke prevented my seeing the
vessel. 'The lights of the = Max were â¢ very
bright. I examined thenr before the-col
lision. ;â¢-, -Â¦Â¦*â¢.- i :* â¢
engine. ' It' took us about twenty minutes
to get up steam 1 in the engine. ; She does
not make any water , now." .
"You saw the steamer's lights fifteen
minutes after the collision?" said Mr!
Bolle's. "Then why. didn't you lower a
boat?" , â¢ -"
"I â¢ thought the steamer* was- not much
damaged and was malting land," replied
Benoist. : 'Â¦/Â¦:Â¦ 'â¢Â¦-...
"Why didn't you find out?" -
"I was looking after my own ship. She
did not steer well Â¦ after the collision." Â¦â¢
"After you knew it was the Mendoclno
light why dirl you steer toward it?"
"It was our intention to go near it and
then turn around. I was not sure it
was the Mendocino light. I wai guess
ing." , . .
-".When I came on deck I saw the Men
docino light and the lights on the steamer
at the same time."-
Captain Hall of the Ill-fated steamer
Walla Walla was. then invited to. question
the witness. . . . . " 'Â¦'. .
.Captain Hall turned to Captain Benoist
and said: Â¦ - -
"How far away :, did . you think the
steamer was before she-sank?" > /
. "About Â¦ three or four miles,'?; replied
the witness. . ' ' '
"Did you take your bearings off, Cape

."Yea, sir."' . â¢. '.Vl'X' - Â¦'Â¦..:Â¦ .â¢/'â¢Â¦

SEm 'ooked after the interests of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company.
Captain Benoist of the French bark Max
looked much rounder than he did a few
days ago. This is due to the fact that .he
; liad his chin whiskers removed. He
proved a willing: witness and his testi
mony proved interesting.
Captain Benoist Testifies.
Â¦ r tai ?u Beno " st was th e first wtfness

Â¦ Die explaining questions to acting Inter
preter Henry, which he put to the wit

Captain Benoist. A statement had been
prepared unaer the direction of the cap
tain andT this was read with many expla
nations by Mr. Henry.
; The statement -was in, part, as follows:

ing, ignace came to me and told me that
he could see the Cape Mendocfno light at
south. 78 east of the compass. The lights
of the steamer could also be seen at 45
cegrees off the starboard bow. The steam
er .was clouded at times by her own
smoke. A sailor named Dorroun . who
was on the lookout, reported, the light of
the steamer some time before. The sailor

the McCulloch gave a lire to the Acme
and helped tow us in. We anchored In
the bay at 8:40 in the evening. In con
sequence of the tow I protested against
the steamer Walla Walla. I make reser
vation of the right to bring suit against
the author of the accident."
Under examination by Captain Bulger
the witness testified that he had been a
rr.8Fter of a vessel for seven years and
heJd a certificate from the- French Gov
ernment. He said he could not tell the
position of his ship at noon the day before
the collision. He said he had not talcen
observations for two days owing to the
cloudy weather. His clock., he said, was
set forty-eight hours before the accident
According to bia time the accident hap
pened at 3:45. As 'it was much la,ter than
this It is evident that his clock was not
on time.
"When the mate called me." lie said,

NEEDS BRITISH GOOD WILL.
Morning Papers Give Some Advice to
Germany.
LONDON, Jan. 10.â Count von Butow
again fills. a large space t in the morning
papers.^which print. columns of extracts
from the opinions of the German and for
eign press and discussions of the matter
by, the. Berlin correspondents. â¢ But- the
majority of the morning papers refrain
from Inflaming the misunderstanding by
editorial comment.
The Dally Graphic, which prints a semi
official statement similaf to the one pub
lished by the Daily Mail, confesses Itself
quite at a loss to understand the object
of Count von Bulow's speech. . .'
r The Chronicle also says It'falla to un
derstand the . blind fury of Germany
against England and the United States.
The Standard says: .."Doubtles3 some
means, will- be found to signify to' the
court at Berlin that some reparation may
appropriately be required. We can only
, trust that the German Government will
recognize the expediency of making a
speedy and . satisfactory amend. .â¢ In the
present grouping of European power* the
good' will of Great Britain cannot be a
matter of indifference to Germany."

heaval in the Office of the
County Clerk-
Many of the newly appointed deputies
and copyists appointed by County Clerk
Mahony yesterday are living In fear of a
further removal edict from -the office of
their chltl. The appointment- of those
who" were sworn -in yesterday ha* caused
a. howl from North Beach to the Potrero
and yesterday several changes were made
In consequence of the storm created.
Frank Grimes, one of the most popular
and efficient deputies at the City Hall,
and who **-as left off the list, was put on
in a hurry, yesterday morning because
pvery voter in the Thirty-eighth Assembly
District demanded it. John J. Cassidy, a
clerk under. Deane, who wae not given a
place by Mahony. -came along while the
etcrm was raging and was provided for.
Judge Hebbard. who lost his clerk. Rob.
<;rt Fitzgerald, when the change In Coun
ty Clerks took place, refused to hold court
yesterday morning because Fitzgerald
was not present and Is using his utmost
endeavors to have him restored to duty.
James E. McElroy. whom no one thought
would bÂ«: left out. is still looking and
lighting ::or an opening and ex-Senator
Thomas Maher and Oscar Tolle," deposed
deputies, are looking for places. The fight
promises to be a merry one,' as with the'
appointment of Grimes and Cassidy the
number ct vacancies Is reduced to one.
Sohler Children Gain a Point.
' The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that Xaxer Sobler's seven children were

ReuES was brought forward by Sohler's
widow as an -unrecognized but legitimate

the estate. .The other children allege that
Reuss Is an impostor.

PEKING, .Jan. . 9.â The ' Dowager ,Em
press of China asserted her complete su
premacy to-day by granting an -audience
in the most sacred halt in the Forbidden
City. The rules of the dynasty forbid
women from entering this hall and the*
Dowager Empress " has never before â¢ vio
lated its sanctity.
: . The Emperor will receive : the Â¦ foreign
diplomats in this hall. - .
Officials believe the Dowager ' Empress
to be paving the way to be present, upon
this occasion In order to prevent any com
munication between the diplomats and the
Emperor except under her censorship.
The Dowager Empress is preparing to
send letters to the Ministers of the for
eign powers here expressing- her desire
for the maintenance of _ the friendly . rela
tions and her, willingness to receive ad
vice in- audience. - \
- Progressive Chinese officials say that
the Dowager" Kmpress disapproved of
Boxcrlsm, that her wishes in this matter
were overruled and that her edicts wera
garbled.
It la possible that General Tung Fuh
Slang,- the notorious anti-foreigner, whose
decapitation has been ordered by the
Dowager Empress in an edict, has already
been beheaded. leMPBUtttPatoBV- â¢â¢

â¢The application for. a writ of mandate
requiring the Auditor to audit a demand
for ?15 alleged Â¦ to be due/for extra serv
ices filed by Joseph A. Harrison, a 'dep
uty,, registrar.' of voters,' was denied by
Judge , Seawell yesterday. .The suit . was
commenced for the purpose of testing
the'valldity of section 4: of the charter,
covering. the salaries of deputy registrars.
The decision 'of Judge Â¦ Seawell destroys
the.' hopes of the deputies in the Regis
trar's ofHce that they would be compen
sated for -working overtime.
) Harrison . wa"S' appointed In . October at
a* salary ' of s $100 per " month. He . worked
several nights from 7:30 to\ 9:30, and thÂ«
claim which the Auditor .refused to ; sign
was for pay for work . performed during
these hours. "â¢ " . ' . ' .
Judge Seawell in, his opinion says:
The â¢ services rendered by the plaintiff be
tween 7:30 p. m. and 9:30 p.\. m.- were of the
same character ' as those ' rendered during the
regular -office hours. ThÂ« only difference be
tween : - them is â¢ as to the hours of the day
during which they were rendered. . - .
The salary of $100 fixed by the resolution of
September ; 30 ; was not merely for - plaintiff' 8
services during certain 'hours of , the day, but
for the entire month, and any provision giving
further compensation for services rendered in
the same capacity during that month is dearly
an increase of salary forbidden by. the charter.
The â¢ so-called "extra" services . rendered by
the Â¦ plaintiff were a part of his official duties
and of : the ', same character as those rendered
at ; other times. Â¦ If the . clerical force of - the
department should at any time be inadequate,
the, board has power to appoint as many cleri
cal assistants as may be necessary, but it has
no . Â»ower, â¢ upon the : theory that the existing*
clerks or deputies are being overworked, to in
crease the salary of any of them after It has

-r-, r-- AYOR SCHMITZ'S troubles be'
n\\*\l gÂ£.n as soon as he entered; his
K W\\ office at the City . Hall yester
][ Y j\ day morning. His mail brought
him a letter from George -H.
Roundey, president of the University
Mound and Bay View Improvement
Club, complaining against the* Board
of Public Works 'for, discriminating
against residents in- the dis^rlct-s
named in the matter - of street ob
structions. Roundey asserts that the
board compels people of small political im
portance to remove obstructions, but more
favored ones are not required to obey the
law. The new Mayor read the letter care
fully and expressed his intention to in-'
vestlgate the complaint. Â¦ The letter, fol
lows: TTjijui rnwuiffiTiniiTiii tiiwi iiwni
To the Hon arable, the Mayor, E. E. Schmitz
âDear Sir: I wish to bring up the subject
of street obstruction and the refusal- (even
after having itsued the notices) of the Board
of Public Works to perform its duty. . <â¢
You will find Uiat the Bureau of Streets, by
order of the Beard of - Public Works,' did issue
on July 30. lÂ£01, notices to a number of people.
Some of the offender?, . under the impression
that these notices would be enforced, removed
the obstructions that they had been illegally
maintaining, but' others, - thebe on the inside
as it. were, did not nor have they yet removed
these obstructions, much to the detriment and
inconvenience of the residents of the district.
Â¦ At the late election- many of the voters, in
order to rea:h the voting booth, were com
pelled to go as many as ten blocks out of their
way.
Outside of the fact that the Board- of Pub
lic Works should remove obstructions on the
public streets, it is a great injustice on their
part to issue notices and then only enforce
them where the people are of small . political
Importance or possibly poor.
Mr. Gartland, attorney for the' Board of
Public Works, is taking a very active interest
In .defending the action of the board in thio
particular case. In Justice to the whole dis
trict . I ..aEk that you . appoint an early date
that we can place the matter before you and
that we may have an attorney . to refute . the
arguments of Mr. Gartland.
As you will see by the notices the. trouble In
long standing and since that date many other
districts are inflicted with the same trouble by
lack of action on the part of the Board of
Public Works.
JS. PARRY'S resignation as
chairman of the executive com
miti.ee <Parry faction) of the
3 Union Labor party is in the
hands of the secretary, to be
presented at the next meeting. The
Union Labor party has' three ex
ecutive committees. At a - meeting
of the original committee, held sev
eral weeks ago, there was a row. The
Parryites, headed by Eugene E. Schmitz:,
left the hall, called a meeting at another
place, and reinstated Parry, who had been
deposed from the chairmanship by the
Delaney faction. Fifteen of the twenty
five executive committeemen followed
Schmitz in the walkout. Ten remained
after Schmit^. Parry and the others
bolted, and acting under the advice of
T. Carl Spelling instituted proceedings in
court to prevent the secretary from de
stroying or mutilating the records.
Laughs at a Report.
The factional committee of which Parry
Is chairman is not a governing body In
the sense of the charter, as it did not
derive its existence from a convention
created by the election law. Parry main
tains that his membership in this com
mittee is no bar whatever to his right
under the charter to hold the office of
Fire Commissioner. He had made up his
mind before he was appointed to the Fire
Commission 1:0 resign from the commit
tee. He says that he would have re
signed some time ago if Mayor Schmitz
had not requested him to remain on the
committee until the new administration
was inaugurated.
Parry laughs at the report that the
following provision of the charter renders
him ineligible for the office of Fire Com
missioner: :Â¦*Â¦;â¢
No person shall be appointed a Fire Com
missioner who shall not have been an elector of
the city and counts' for at least five years next
preceding his appointment.
Speaking on this topic last evening
Parr> r remarked: . ; ,
I have lived in San Francisco for twenty
years. I registered and voted in the Forty
third District seven or eight years ago when
l>on Dennery ran for the Assembly." I sup
ported Dennery at the request of Senator Ala
honey.
Crixamins Is Reviled.
In response to questions concerning his
early life. Parry said thathis people lived
at Albion. Monroe County. Iowa. He left
Oskaloosa, Iowa, twenty-four years ago
and went to Arizona. He came to Cali
fornia from Arizona. He said the list of
registered voters and the Directory prior
to 1S36 each gave his name, residence
and occupation. Parry asserts that he
has not absented himself from the- city,
barring a two weeks' trip East, since he
arrived here.
There is a very bitter feeling in the
Burns camp against Crlmmins. The story
groes that the colonel's friends were
shamefully duped and betrayed by the
ex-partner of Martin Kelly. The dupes,
however, get no sympathy from Kelly.
The boss of the Twenty-eighth District
gives Lynch and the others the "ha ha"
for trusting Crimmins. The story, as
given to The Call, is to the effect that an
agreement was made that the "organiza
tion" should have the patronage, and
that John C. Lynch, representing Burns,
and Phil Crlmmins. representing some
other faction, should make out the list
<*f aEP o iateÂ£s in. -the departments con
trolled by Republicans. Last Tuesday
night the list was finished and Lynch
five the Burns* workers assurance that
their names were on the accepted rolL
Now It is claimed that Crimmins fur
nished the Sheriff and County Clerk with
a list differing from that to which .was
agreed to by Lynch. â¢â¢ â¢â¢ Â¦"
It is hard to get the exact truth re
garding the affair. The workers who have
been betrayed and sold out revile Crim
mins in one sentence and curse Lynch in
another. All of the workers, the ins and
outs, are of one mind regarding Crim
mins. They assert that this is his politi
cal finish. It is common talk that Crim
mins' expenses, incident to his manner of
life, are considerable, and that the newly
appointed deputies and clerks will be ex
pected to "pungle up" a certain percent
age of their salaries to put him at his
ease financially.
General surprise would not be caused if
the new Grand Jury should call in every
one of the newly appointed, to ascertain
If there had been any sort of understand
ing, direct, indirect or by any form or
Eugr^estion. that they should pay part of
their ealarlss or contribute money from
other sources to liquidate campaign obli
gations.- ' Â¦

A CHi/WJCE TO SMILE.
The Call yesterday pointed out that â¢ when the State
Board of : Equalization' completed its .work in 1901
tHe Southern Pacific Company's railroad lines in this
State were assessed at $10,500 per mile, and the Cen
tral Pacific Company's lines were assessed at $17,408
per mile. The unfairness of such a low "assessment
of the property is shown by statistics given, in Poor's
Manual. The figures of the manual brought down to
June 30, 1900, show that the total mileage; owned by
the company at that time was 7865 miles, of line.- The
gross earnings for the'.entire system actually owned
by, the company averaged, $8106 66' per mile and^the
net earnings, were $2194 84, even according to the
figures of the The debt, averaged more
than $29,117 per mile, the total capital stock then
being $197,832,148 and the '-bonded debt $31,176,506..
" It , is" well ; known ' that "where j real . estate is " mort
gaged in California the mortgage is assessed Tat its
full value. That is the i burden. placed uponlthe prop!
erty of citizens generally. The Southern; Pacific
Company, however, was permitted' to shirk' by far
the^larger part-of the taxation it- should hav e ; borne
had its property been" 'assessed on the same rule.' The
assessment- of ; last year was only Â¦'.'about 'one-fourth
Of all the tax-shirkers in California the Southern â¢
Pacific Company has been "guilty -of the largest
frauds, and its offenses have been the most flagrant. .
In times past the State. Board of Equalization -.has
done something more than wink at the practices of.
the corporation. The assessments of the value of its
property in the State have been of a kind to generate
suspicion that the board actually, aided and abetted'
the road in shirking taxes and in shifting them upon
others. Such havirfg been the case in the past, it is
worth while to make a strong effort to obtain jus
tice and fair dealing this time.;
WITH the new year there comes the necessity
of giving renewed attention to problems of
taxation. In a. short time assessments' will
be made of the value of property and of the. share
which each citizen will have to bear of the burden of
public expenditures. A certain amount of money is;
required for the maintenance of the city, county and
State. That amount must be forthcoming. If one man
shirk his taxes another must pay them. Therefore
it is to the interest of all that each in proportiori'tp
his means. pay his rightfu,l share of the general taxa
tion. The shirker is to some extent a defrauder of
all., He cheats -' everybody,, and, not infrequently; he
resorts to^perjury | and sometimes ; to ; bribery or
something like it to carry out the fraud. '

DAKOTA, S.. City. Dakota Is the In
dian for E pluribus unum and means
many in one. It was used by the Indian
specifically, to designate the many tribes
that were under the government of one
chief. â¢
It is apparent that there is no room for dogmatism
on the subject, and certainly no reason for the great
expectations which are entertained by the thick and
thin municipal socialists. Â»
Comparing cost of works and price of supply, San
Francisco reports cost at $15,000,000, average- price
per dwelling $20 per year; but Evansville, Ind., with
municipal works costing $500,000, charges $15 per
dwelling, and Cambridge, Mass., also with municipal
water at a cost of $2,563,248, charges $17. A glance
at the supply, cost and water rate of fifty cities in the
United States, all but fourteen- under municipal
ownership, reveals such an infinite variely of results
as to baffle conclusions. Therefore we make no
Â¦conclusions, but publish such facts as can be had out
of the chaos. To show the confusion of facts we
have San Francisco furnishing 20,000,000 gallons a
day at a rate per dwelling of $20 a year, and. Nash
ville, Tenn., with municipal /'works, furnishing 10,
coo.ooo gallons a day at a rate of $22. -\
The mere fact of public ownership does not purify
water. That must be done by the same means that
private owners have to use. Providence and San
Francisco have the same typhoid rate, one with'mu
nicipal water and the other without Milwaukee- and
Detroit, with municipal water, have a typhoid rate
of 30 per 1000.
The Chicago Chronicle, in calling attention to this
waste, proposes to pi event it, as far as caused by
consumers, by compelling every one to use a meter
and a filter. The latter is necessary on account of
the pollution of the water, which is safe for drinking
only when boiled. .
poorly laid and much of it old and worn out ' The
result is a waste of water. To' this waste is added
that caused by the carelessness of the 1 consumers.
* The total loss to the city from this source is $200,000
annually, this is by no means all the loss and waste"
incident to the. administration of the system But if
It were administered as a private and not a public
matter docs any one imagine that such waste would
go on year after year? The people are the owners
of the property. It is administered by their public
officers. The waste is their loss, as owners. By
calling attention to it an effort may be induced to
effect its correction. But the advocates of .municipal
ownership persistently treat a . reference to it as in
imical to the policy of municipal socialism.
In Chicago the City Engineer has recently sup
plemented the Merchants" Association in an exami
nation of public water administration. He finds in
that city 19,000 miles of water pipes, a large part
tary public bodies, affecting the municipal water
systems of several large cities, which reveal a chaos
of accounts and a waste in administration that -may
have been considered by Mr. Wright and may not,
no one knows.
Our critic calls our attention to the report on this
subject by Mr. Carroll D. Wright, the United
States Labor Commissioner. The value of that re
port is abridged by its statement that its conclusions
are based upon w hat is learned secretly. Since it was
made investigations have been carried on, by volun-
administration of public utilities are kept by' the
same system and with equal publicity. For an ex-'
ample we noted the State commission of Massachu
setts, in charge of the lighting systems of that State,'
and declared that until like commissions are pro
vided elsewhere, over all public utilities, the facts'
upon which to base a public policy will be lacking.' .'

the late George Augustus Sala referring

supposed to do what he sees he ought to

about doing â to be,' in " fact, a mere an
nouncement of future action, more or less
remote." According to this the" sentence
ought to be, "I do not think I shall go to
the theater."
Dr. Doyle has written twenty- two nov
els, and he is purposing to issue shortly
a complete edition, leaving out all tha
work he considers immature, which will
reduce the number to fifteen volumes.
He began story writing; when he was 18,
and continued contributing to magazines
of the caliber of Cornhill and Temple
Bar for ten years, working all the time
at his profession of medicine.
The retail price being sixpence, the mar;
gin of profit is sufficient to Induce book
sellers to push the sales. Dr. Doyle id
understood to have examined every speci
fic charge and has been able from various
sources of information ,to gather suffi
cient evidence, in his opinion, to meet
completely each one. Every public man
and every newspaper In the country will
receive a copy, and Dr. Doyle has ar
ranged for a translation in five different
European languages. It is his intention
to send a copy to every deputy, every
statesman and every newspaper on the
Continent. .. -.;
The bookâ Dr. Doyle* calls It a pamphlet
âwill consist of 60,000 words. Neither the
author nor the publishers, Messrs. Smith,
Elder & Co., propose to make any profit.
The Issue will be sold to the trade at the
bare cost of production; that is, about
three halfpence a copy.

Conan Doyle has for some months past

Stimulated by the; success of the white people;; in,
establishing and operating manufactures, the negroes *
are; eager to venture ;.upon like enterprises. In an,
address delivered in the negro building , Professor
Miller of the SouthV "Carolina college for colored
students said: "I can locate a cotton factory in tide
water Carolina and operate -it with negro hands and
make more money on the capital invested than has"
been or can be made with white hands in the coun
ties of Anderson, Richland, Chester, Greenville,
Spartanburg," Cherokee, York or Union, and cotton
factories' have always paid in the counties named. I
have studied the ; conditions the .factories;
in Upper Carolina, and know; for'a certainty- that'the
conditions for making money in cotton' factories with
negro labor in Lower Carolina are superior to those
in .Upper Carolina, where white labor .is "employed."
It is i more j than probable J that an ; appeal : of that
kind will find . capitalists wiliing\to' back theL.move
ment for establishing factories with 'negro laborers
Certainly the fact that the orators â¢of.ihe colored men
are "talking business' instead of. politics and are look-;
ing for the advancement of their race through work
rather than legislation is a significant, feature of the '
time. As expositions go in these . days that . at

Congress should understand one thing. ' The coun
try is not prepared to champion one route against
the other. What it wants' is an isthmian canal. If
it be true that the Panama can.be finished' quicker
and cheaper, that is what the people want, for. they
expect that Congress will at this session see to it that
we are to have a canal. ...
. Therefore this Darien route is more likely to re
main/an interesting topographical. feature in the his
.tory of the, canal discussion than to be seriously
considered as a feasible route. â¢ ' ... '
Mr. Radcliffe reported to Congress in 1838 upon
this Darien route by the Atrato that it was entirely
unsuited for a ship canal and much inferior ', to the
other routes'for any sort of communication by rea
son of the great distance between; the two oceans
and want of depth in both rivers and the lack of
harbors at each end. .
The Darien route is now brought forward ' as de
serving of considerationX We do hot know whether'
it has ever been subjected to survey or estimate. :-
According to Humbcldt's report it is lacking in
water, though it has "some interesting features and r
enjoys the distinction 'of haying furnished an ail-i,
water route between the two oceans as early as 1788.:
Humboldt said of it: "This route is by the "rivef.vi
Atrato and a small branch emptying into it higher
up, called the .0uit6, which empties into the main
stream 410 miles from its mouth, ; the . town of
Quidbo .being near their junction. The Quito
approaches very near to the waters of a- small river"
emptying into the Pacific, named the San Juanj. be
tween the sources of which and the Quito' is a small
ravine called De.la Raspadura, through which, it
will not be an uninteresting , fact in the. future his
tory of this subject, a canal communication .be
tween the two oceans has already been made A
monk of great activity, Cure of the village of
Novita, employed his parishioners to dig a small
canal in the ravine' De la Raspadura, by means of
which, when the rains are, abundant, canoes loaded
with cocoa pass from sea to sea. This communica
tion has existed since 1788, though unknown in Eu
rope. This small canal of Raspadura unites on the
coast of two oceans, two points seventy-five leagues
distant from one another." v
In the esrly discussions of the subject 'Panama held
first place and the Nicaragua'route second; and it is
probable that in the judgment of engineers they still
stand in that order. In building any canal the source
of water supply must not be lost sight of, and this
supply is abundant by either route. [Â¦ '
â¢Humboldt, who investigated all the routes, said of
Panama: "This, -being the 1 narrowest part of -, the.
isthmus, is the route to which the attention' first -riat-;
urally directs itself.* The shortest distance across, in;
a straight line is less than thirty miles. The*. Chagres'.
River is navigable to within fifteen miles' of the P,4:''
cific Coast." ' '
The Panama route has always found favor with
engineers and investors. Indeed it was- the first
route- to which serious attention was directed. 'More :
thah'a year ago The Call predicted' that it was des
tined to figure very largely and might be the means
of. defeating the machinations of the enemies of an,
isthmian canal, who were juggling the treaties, in
the name and pretense of patriotism:- *>;l; â¢â¢
TIfE canal question -in Congress is materially af
fected by,, the offer, to sell the Panama: canal
and convey_all of its privileges and concessions
from 1 the Colombian Government for the sum of $40,
000,000.; At that price it seems a good buy by any
body. V v 'â¢ " ./[ *.':'- "-.",*.Â¦'Â¦ Â¦ â¢ Â¦;. Â¦ Â¦ ".-' /'Â¦ '"

By. turning this rebate Into the Cuban treas

responsibility for its expenditure, ana if they
deem it wise to directly aid the growers of
tobacco and 6ugar, they can do so. Now that
Cuba la an Independent nation, I hold the
United Slates have no right to pay either
bounty or rebate to any of the particular in-'
dustrics cf that country.
The cost of producing raw sugars, as com
pared wit* the refined product, is 03 per cent,
or in other words, in $100 worth of refined
sugar $93 of that Is for the raw material and
only $7 for the refining:
I am favorable to the proposition to make
a rebate on the sugrars and tobaccos from
Cuba whether It be 25 or 50 per cent, but In
sist that it shall be turned over to the Cuban
Government to be used by It, and not turned
over to the planters, as â¢ Is being: advocated
by some.
The beet sugar men are not united in
support of Oxnard's plan. The Michigan
and California members of the House
have resolved to oppose all concessions.
Senator Dietrich of Nebraska announces
his opposition to all drawbacks, as well as
to concessions to be paid to the Cuban
planters. Dietrich says he will not oppose
the drawback on Cuban sugar if it Is
paid to the Cuban Government He says:
CALL BUREAU. 1408 G STREET, N.
TV., WASHINGTON, Jan.' 9.â The beet
sugar men have at last come to the con-'
elusion that they cannot .oppose tariff con
cessions to Cuba without precipitating the
annexation . of the Islands to the United
States. Oxnard has agreed with ;. Frank
Pavey, taho represents the Cuban sugar
planters, to advocate a bill granting a
drawback of not exceeding 50 per cent of
the tariff on Cuban sugar for one. year.
The beet sugar men. are not agreed'upon
this proposition, but Oxnard la willing to
accept such legislation for one year as a
means of helping the Cuban planters out
of their deplorable condition. It is a modi
fication of Oxnard' s proposition made ten
days ago I to pay a bounty of one-half a
cent on Cuban sugar. â¢ That . proposition
was so ridiculous that Oxnard could per
suade no one in Congress to father it.
He has now agreed with Pavey to another
proposition,. which will not meet with ap
proval In Congress for the reason It would
involve the Government in almost as dan
gerous an experiment as that of paying a
bounty to foreign producers as a means
of protecting- those at home. ' ' â¢ -
It is simply another effort to check the
movement in favor of reciprocal trade re
lations vrith Cuba. That movement has
become so strong that the Ways and
Means Committee. has been forced to take
recognition of It and get ready to prepare
a bill authorizing the President to grant
a 25 per cent reduction on Cuban sugar
and tobacco when the Cuban Government
is ready to grant reciprocal reductions in
its tariff against American products. The
sentiment in favor of such concessions to
Cuba has grown in the Senate. and House.

AIMS TO AID
ALL COMMERCE
Favored Grain Handling
Firm % of Kansas City
.Benefited.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan. 9.â The Inter
state Commerce Commissioners spent six
hours here to-day and examined . seven
witnesses regarding grain rates from
Western points to Atlantic seaboard and
other Eastern destinations. They re
turned to Chicago to-night, after an
nouncing that the investigation would be
resumed in that city January 24, when It
is believed several big railway officials
will be called.
â¢The expected rush of railroad officials
and grain shippers to-day to confess that
they had made s and received freight re
bates or cut rates did not occur. In fact,
what information was elicited was ob
tained only after persistent questioning
on the' part of the Commissioners. The
most direct admission was that of John
A. Robinson of the firm of Hall & Rob
inson of Kansas City, which controls the
export grain business of the Missouri Pa
cific. â¢ Robinson admitted that W. C.
Stith, freight traffic manager of the Mis
souri Pacific, made him a rate on export
grain to New Orleans of from 3 to 5 cents
per hundred lower than the published ex
port tariff. Other testimony went to show
that Kansas City was made to suffer from
discrimination by the through lines be
cause of an arbitrary rate on grain in ef
fect here. / -Â¦
Only three/ members of the commission
attended the/ hearingâ Judson C. Clements
of Georgia, Charles A. Prouty of Vermont
and James D. Yeomans of Iowa. -â¢
How Competition Is Destroyed.
W. P. Trickett, head of the Kansas City
Transportation, Bureau, the first- witness,
said the arbitrary proportionate and dif
ferential grain rates as they obtain: on
goods shipped from Kansas City east
place Kansas City at a disadvantage.- He
said that the through grain lines, which
were the Santa Fe, Missouri Pacific arid
Rock Island, each had special -grain rep
resentatives In the person of certain grain
firms and that these flma could afford
to pay a higher rate than other gram
men, as they undoubtedly receive conces
sions from the railroads. Such a system,
he said, had been in vogue since . about
1896, and It had destroyed competition;;
J. A. Robinson of Hall & Robinson,
grain commission merchants; which, firm
Trickett had testified was the represen
tative here of the Missouri Pacific : Rail
road,'declared his firm had never.:re-
ceived money for rebates, or asa; conces
sion from the railroad or. from any other
source, directly or indirectly, during the
past three years. His firm, he said, held
a definite and not an elastic rate with the
Missouri Pacific. , â¢ . ., â¢â¢'Â¦Â¦.-
Fred Hodse, local representative of
Richardson & Co. of Chicago, was the
next witness.' Trickett had testified that
this ' firm' was the representative of- the
Santa Fe Railroad and Hoose was asked
if this were a fact. He declared he had
no ' knowledge of any ' arrangement by
which his firm had any special advantage
or concession from that railway. He ad
mitted that of- two â¢: million Â¦ bushels ' of
grain handled by his firm in Kansas dur
ing the past year the Santa Fe received
all but 250.000 bushels. 1 But this wa3 sim
ply because the Santa Fe ran through bet

Certain Elevators Are Favored
Commissioner Prouty thought this state
ment preposterous, saying that it forced
the consignor to pay the arbitrary rate in
force in Kansas City unnecessarily.
The Commissioners tried to bring out
the fact that the existence of the Midland
Elevator Company was. a subterfuge' to
evade the interstate commerce law and
that Eastern destination was intended
when grain ,was first consigned and that a
lay-over here means the application of
the arbitrary rate of one cent on a hun
dred pounds, which justified the suspicion
that an underhand ,motlve exists.
Allis interposed to say. that such conclu

"WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.-Secretary Root
gave an Interesting exposition of the con
dition of .affairs In the Philippines, to
gether with the outlook for terminating
military by civil rule, in the course of a
hearing to-day before the House Com
mittee on Military Affairs, in connection
with the army appropriation bill. Tha
meeting was behind closed doors and no
exact statement of Root's remarks was
given out, aithougn the following is un
derstood to embody the more essential
features:
The discussion of the Philippine condi
tions was brought out by a question by
Hay of Virginia as to whether civil gov
ernment could be maintained in the isl
ands without the presence of the army.
In reply Root stated that the army was
necessary as a moral force to maintain
the civil administration now established.
'One of the main causes, he said, why
there had not been more progress in the
Philippines was that the Spooner amend
ment, passed by Congress last year and
restricting the grant of franchises, had
the effect of preventing the investment of
capital and the consequent employment of
labor. | Many people were Idle and many
of these became conspirators simply be
cause they were Idle. The Secretary in
stanced the fact that, although rice was
one of the main products of the Philip
pines, yet about $5,000,000 worth qt rice
had to be Imported last year. In this
and many other branches of Industries
the wheels of industry were not moving,
the people out of employment were en
couraged in viclousness and as a result it
was necessary to keep some 40,000 troops
in the islands. ....
In some provinces a very satisfactory
administration had been set up. But
Root pointed out that even In provinces
where civil government had been a suc
cess there were men conspiring to assist
in the agitation and warfare carried pn
in neighboring provinces. On the whole,
however, the Secretary^ expressed the be
lief that ff Congress enacted the bill pro
posed by Senator Lodge or that of Rep
resentative Cooper of Wisconsin, provid
ing systems of laws for the Philippines,
it would be possible soon thereafter grad
ually to reduce the military establish
ment in the Philippines. He did not be
lieve it would be a rapid or complete ter
mination of military rule, as the condi
tions smong natives were firmly fixed and
it -would take much time to bring about
the new order of affairs. v Root said that
better progress had been made In the last
year than had been expected, and ho ex
pressed the opinion that civilization ulti
mately would be extended to the people
of the islands. To illustrate this point he
said the Philippine people had been in
effect living under a sixteenth century
government and the United States want
ed to give them a twentieth century gov
ernment.

The Real Cause of Dandruff and Bald-
ness.
At one time dandruff was attributed to
be the result of a feverish condition of
the scalp, which threw off the dried cuti-
cle in scales.
Professor Unna, Hamburg, Germany,
noted authority on skin diseases, explodes
this theory and says that dandruff is a
germ disease.
This germ is really responsible for the
dandruff and for so many bald head*.
It can be cured if It Is gone about In the
right way. The right way, of course, and
the only way, is to kill the germ.
Newbro's Herpidde does this, and
causes the hair to grow luxuriantly. Just
as nature Intended it' should.

Members of the San Francisco Cycje
Board of Trade and representatives of
bicycle interests in all parts of California

building last night for the purpose of
forming a State organization to control
the sale and repair of bicycles. The sub

various speakers, and the consensus of
opinion was that the earlier the dealers
organized the better it would be for the
trade. / . â¢

Alexander Vogelsang spoke of Mr. Bab
cock as the leading salmon culturist of the
coast and said it was a marked compli
ment to California that be should be
selected by British Columbia when the
k! reams of this State produce less salmon
than do those of any other part of the
coast.
Judge John Hunt replied to the toast
"Truthful John.". His words were a
blending of humor and sentiment.
Songs were rendered by W. W. Brackett
Lloyd Spencer and Elton Lambert. Those
present were:
Some months since Mr. Babcock accept
ed the responsible position of Commis
sioner of Fisheries of British Columbia.
He left here upon short notice for the
north and his former associates among
the fly-casters availed of his presence in
this city, on a brief visit, to honor him.
Some of the brightest minds of the bencn
and bar paid graceful, affectionate tribute
to the worth of Mr. Babcock. Judge John
Hunt, Charles S. Wheeler, Alex T. Vogel
sang and John A. Hcsmer were among
those who responded to toasts.
After the banquet the members voted
upon an Important measure. It was de
cided to hold a fly-casting tournament In
August, open to the world. Teams are
expected to enter the competition from
New York, Chicago. Grand Rapids and
other cities. Valuable prizes will, be
onered. The tournament will be held
during the height of the fishing season to
afford visiting anglers an opportunity of
enjoying the famous sport which the
fruckee and ether .streams afford.
Secretary Horace Smyth of the club
could not be present last night, owing to

The board of managers at its meeting
lajst week solemnly delegated the cat
question to the bouse committee. Then
the conflict centered around the-commit
tee. When it became known that Chair
man Bonnet favored the advent of
"Tombstone II," while' Carpenter and
Trowbrldge were opposed, there was glee
in the ranks of the "antis." This proved
to be premature. Carpenter was Induced
by the "Catomaniacs," i as they were
derisively dubbed, to take an extended
trip abroad. This left the vote a tie and
the board of managers, after much-argu
ment, ended the deadlock by voting fa
vorably upon the following application for
membership: -.
Name, Tombstone II; occupation, hunter and
trapper: former residence. Niles Canyon: de
gree, honorary; sponsors â C. Horatio Jessen,
John J. Harrison. Thomas . Guise.

fused to permit its memory to be dishon
ored by conferring the title upon an ani
mal of plebeian origin.
Beverai weeks ago, when the board of
managers received a communication set
ling forth that a' member was prepared
to donate a living image of the cat that
had perished, there was excitement in the
Press Club. Old-time members took to
celebrating and legends of the departed
"Tombstone" monopolized the fireplace
chat; but while tbe rejoicing was at Its
height a war cloud arose upon the hori
zon. The Knockers' Club, a sub-organi
zation that draws Its membership largely
from the late additions to the parent or
ganization's roll, saw a chance to make
trouble. Chief Hammer Thrower Phil
Bolger presided at a meeting of the dis
turbers and It was decided that a thor
oughbred cat was not a crying need. This
pronouncement, while receiving scatter
ing support from new members, aroused
bitter resentment in the breasts of the
Fine-street pioneers.
"Cat or No Cat?" the Question.
Then for two weeks there was waged
factional strife that threatened to disrupt
the club. "Cat or no cat?" became a
burning issue. There was vigorous prose
lyting by both sides and for a time na-
across the top. Long before the express
man reached the Ellis-street quarters
the voice of the prisoner could be heard
In indignant protest at his confinement.
\V hen the slats were removed twenty of
San Francisco's prominent professional
men became at once as busy as a poor
family suddenly visited by a rich and
aged relative. Each wanted to' do his
share in extending hospitality to the
stranger. The cat "sized up the bunch"
with a look like that of a prospective Elk
awaiting initiation. Then it beat a cau
tious retreat to the jinksroom stage,
climbed a ladder and sought a place of
safety on the dizzy heights of a rafter,
where he remained until fear gave way
to hunger. .
Since it has got over its first scare
"Tombstone II" takes to club life as a
matinee girl takes to chewing gum. It
has become chummy, keeps late hours
and breakfasts in the afternoon like a
true Bohemian. Even those who opposed
Its advent into the club are relenting and
it -bids fair to become a fixture, . though
its somber appearance has something of
a subduing effect. The managers have
voted a weekly appropriation to provide
for its wants, and it already sports a sil
ver collar. â¢ ,

Track Notes.
Old Llzzella, the favorite, won the mile
and a quarter selling event in almost
easy fashion, covering the distance In
2:05%. Ransch, with Dangerous Maid,
tried to steal a march on . his company,
and opened up an immense gap of day
light. O'Connor moved up .- gradually
with the favorite, and, passing the Jlaid
at the head of the stretch, scored without
difficulty from Plohn. The others were
strung out In processional style.
Night .before Bob Smith's horse Mar
shall Neil looked a fit subject to fatten
up' an emaciated bank roll, and in the
betting 'on the final sprint nearly every
body unloaded at 6 to 5. Those who
couldn't get there earlier accepted 9 to
10. When^sent away O'Connor on Rose
cf Hilo jumped out in front, and, leading
from the start, downed the -favorite a
length. Then followed King DelHs, Reina
de Cuba and the ferry-boat. ;
Rubus. the fast Bramble filly from the
stable of Chinn & Forsythe, earned a nose
decision over Huachuca, the even money
favorite, . for the six furlong run for
three-year-olds. Tommy Burns also rode
Rubus, making the pace .from the start.
Mounce made a bungling job of it on
the favorite, bringing him from, the far
rear. Legal Maxim -was third..
Four favorites in Quiet, Huachuca, La
Goleta and Marshall Neil were added to
the beaten list. , Rose of Hilo at 15 to 1
gladdened the hearts of the last-chance
bettors when she came in before Marshall
Neil in the closing number.
Green Morris' great colt, Homestead,
the best three-year-old on the track,
again conceded pounds to a field of ail
aged horses in the Emeryville handicap,
and led them a dog's life. It appeared to
be the consensus of opinion as on the oc
casion of their previous meeting that La
Goleta would beat the three-year-old, and
the Baldwin mare went to the post fa
vorite. "Â¦ Mounce got in all manner of
pockets and, after squeezing through be
tween the inner rail and The Pride In the
stretch, dropped the first choice down
third. -O'Connor dodged all ticklish spots
with Homestead,, winning by nearly
three lengths from Rio Shannon, a 12 to
l;shot; in 1:40%. The Pride and Bathos
cut out the running to the stretch, where
both informally retired.
:, A six and a half furlong selling run
opened the sport, with Quiet, a highly
touted one from the stable of Walter Jen
nings, closing favorite, backed from 6 to
3.. The good thing' galloped to the stretch
and then began backing up. Tommy
Burns on the 4 to 1 chance, Snowberry,
did some skillful piloting, winning ridden
out from Larry Wilt, a 12 to 1 shot. Ma
ielio downed King Herald for the show.

not disappointed.) Sombrero, ridden by

the surprise was furnished by , San Nico

The black -fellow was looked upon in "the
light of a, Havana filler pitched in with
a choice box of . perf ectos. He, too, de
feated the "Que.eh of Poverty How," and,
after making all the running, wpa led
out only a length /by the Morris colt in
1:39^4. 'The/- betting favored Sombrero "at
odds of 4 to 5, while the admirers of Josie
G, and there were many, got 8 to 5. At
the start the last-named fllly, piloted on
this occasion; by Redfern, who was not
even compelled to have his hair cut to do
the 89 pounds,, broke away a trifle slower
than usual. Soon moved into second po

Sombrero was busy with hands and feet,
and not until . the paddock had â¢ been

Miller came into court about 11 j o'clock
and Spencer at once asked the court to in
struct the witness to speak of I Miller as
"Mr. Miller," as Raker had been in jail all
night for calling him "Danny". Miller." The
court commanded both attorneys to call
him "Mr." Miller. â¢ Some words'- passed
The witness stated that when he made
his first : confession at Stewart Hall in
the presence of Simmons, Woodmansee,
Miller and the* grand jurors, he told. them
that the reason he had not before made
his confession before the Grand Jury and
the court was because he was afraid some
of the lynchers or the people from Look
out would kill - him. Miller ' and Wood
mansee told him that he need not be
afraid, as he would be protected by them.
When he (left Stewart Hail -he was pro
tected by an armed guard consisting of
Miller, Woodmansee, Myron Ayres and
Charles Lamburth and was taken on back
streets to the Grand Central Hotel. Sev
eral men i were watching Stewart Hall
while he was there, and the witness was
told that they were trying to get him
either to shoot him or to carry him off to
keep him from making a. confession. '
The court here instructed the attorney
for the defense to -call the witness "Mr.
Hutton,". and not "John," as he did not
deem it proper to address him so famil
iarly. ' Raker then asked the witness if
ho had assumed so much importance dur
ing Â¦ the past two or ; three days - that he
wanted to be . called VMr. - Hutton" ? - At
torney Post promptly objected to the wit
ness being. Insulted in that manner. "Coun
sel for the defense seem determined to
bring Miller into this, case, but - Judge
Harrington is using every effort to keep
his name out of the cross-examination.
The eYoss-examination of John Hutton
was continued. He was asked if "Danny"
Miller was his custodian last night. The
witness . stated be . was in possession of
A. L. Smith, who was recently appointed
bailiff of the court. Hutton then was
asked if he did not know that Smith was
an official of the prosecution. He replied
that he did not, and General Post I ob
jected to the question on the ground that
Smith was not such an official. He' stated
that he was brought to the- court by
"Danny" Miller. ' i .

plauding- to be- removed from the court
room. General Post did not reply to the
defendant's argument and the motion was
denied. - The courtroom was almost Â»de
serted and there were but two or three
ladies present. . ,
It is reported late this evening that th<
Grand Jury has : returned indictment;
against Hutton ; and . Morris,' who . hav<
made statements and confessions, anc
they will ' probably be arraigned - anc

Â¦ . The witness stated that Miller accom
panies him ' from the Courthouse to the
hotel because he is afraid to go alone;
afraid he would be injured by Dave Sny
der and Deloss Brownell, because Snyder
had â¢ told Â¦- him personally that â¢ any one
who turned State's . evidence ought to be
shot. .Under cross-examination ? he said
he '. was -afraid of. Attorneys Raker and
Spencer. When asked why he * said he
was " afraid - of . Raker getting angry as
he did last night. This resulted in a row
between Attorneys Post and Raker on ac
count 6T Raker stating that Miller drew
a revolver. Post denied it. Personalities
were flung back and forth until the court
interfered.-' ' N :Â«Â¦ Â¦

The cross-examination of Hutton was
resumed this afternoon. He was asked if
he had read. in an Alturas paper â¢ that
there were rewards to the amount of $2500
offered for the conviction of lynchers.
An objection to the . question : was sus
tained and the court remarked that it was
"a pipe dream of the editor/; The witness
stated that the Rev. Mr. Simmons exam
ined his head a' few days ago and told him
that he was not very bright and that
some time he would be worth considera
ble money. The defense is apparently en
deavoring to show that the witness ex
pects a reward ' and Â¦ that Simmons had
some influence in getting Hutton's confes
sion. The prosecution allowed these
questions without objections.
between Spencer and the court relative to
shotgun and cannon barrels they had
looked into during their careers.
Nearly the same line of examination
was gone over as yesterday, the defense
endeavoring to find out by whom the wit
ness was guarded during the time he was
in the hotel. The prosecution did not ob
ject to this line of questioning save ex
pressing a desire to save time and offered
to admit that the witness was under
guard all the time and by whom. The de
fense, however, | would not accept i the of
fer of the prosecution, claiming to have
other facts, to bring out in their cross-ex
amination. : .
A personal encounter was narrowly
averted during the recess at 3 o'clock be
tween Attorney Raker and the District
Attorney of Lassen County. James H.
Boyd and Mrs. . R. L. Nichols started to
go out of the courtroom and were stopped
by Mrs Mary Lorenz, who spoke to them.
Boyd stepped up to her side and said to
General Post: "Here is an eavesdropper."
Raker saw the movement and heard what
was eald and sprang to his feet, exclaim
ing! ' â¢ : Â¦ Â¦
'â¢You are a dirty coward to insult a
woman like that." '
Boyd admitted that he said it, but
denied it to be an insult. Raker then
again called him a coward and on the
Sheriff's interference he told the Sheriff
he ought to slap Boyd's face for insult
ing Mrs. Nichols. Some very personal re
marks were made and Sheriff Street or
dered both men to their seats v -:- -
When the session began this. morning
Attorney Spencer moved that the Sheriff
be ordered to search every person in the
courtroom â¢ and see that . none carried
weapons. Judge Harrington said he knew
of no one carrying weapons in. court and:
Spencer called his attention to the fact
that Miller' drew a revolver on Attorney
Raker last night in court. The court said ,
he did not see Miller draw the weapon.
The Judge also said that if any. more ap

ALTURAS, Jan. 9.â Attorney Raker,
leading counsel for the defense of
Brown in the Lookout lynching
case, had an unpleasant number
of hours in jail last night as a
penalty for contempt of court,' but he was
primed for more legal strife to-day. Ra
ker and Dan Miller, the latter being a
sort of - bodyguard for the prosecution's
lawyers," disturbed the of the
court yesterday by a very ominous inter
change of uncomplimentary remarks, and
the bitter clamor of eager tongues caused
an amazingly rapid exit of the fearsome
auditors.

The Robert Duncan did not suffer any
loss of life throughout her terrible ex
perience. In fact, the crew and officers
came through it in fine shape, only one
trivial case of rheumatism occurring on
the' Ions and exhaustive trip.
The strong: Bhip stood up under the
strain, however, and rode out the typhoon
only to run int</ a succession of storms.
She was out one hundred days and in all
that time there was no one pleasant day.
Three days out from the straits she ran
Into the storm that reached here Christ
mas night.
Thirty-five miles out from Cape Flattery
the Duncan lost her second j set of sails.
Fortunately she" had three sets aboard
and was able to rig out again. She finally
made the straits and took a tug at Clal
lam Bay, arriving here this morning. The
last biscuit on board the ship was eaten
Wednesday morning. Captain MacLean
says he lived on beef tea . for the past
two weeks. He also states that just be
fore the typhoon struck his ship he saw
a four-masted American schooner which
undoubtedly went through the same
storm. She was so far away that he
could not ascertain her name.
The wind seemed, to come from every
quarter .all at the same time and would
hurl the mighty ship about as if she were
made of bamboo. The sails were blown
to threads, the ballast was shiiied, the
stanchions below were wrenched out -of
place, seas flooded the vessel from stem
to stern, the spars were damaged and all
the eatables were ruined.
PORT ANGELES.. Wash., Jan. 9.â The

here to-day after one of the worst voy
ages on record. She started ' from Wei-
Hal- Wei in ballast, for Royal Roads on

south of Japan she was struck by a
typhoon that raged with relentless fury
for forty-eight hours. . Captain MacLean
says It was indescribable.

Ninety Per Cent of It Really
Caused From Poor Digestion.
Real organic heart trouble is incurable, but
scarcely one case In a hundred is organic.
The action of the heart and stomach are both
controlled by the same great nerve3, the sympa-
thetic and pneumogastric, and when the stom-
ach falls to properly digest' the food and It lies
in the stomach fermenting, gases are formed
which distend the causing pressure on
the heart and lungs, causing palpitation, ir-
regularity and shortness of breath.
The danger . from this condition is that the
continued disturbance of the heart sooner or
later may cause real organic heart trouble and
in fa'ct frequently does so. . y, s
Furthermore, poor, digestion makes the blood
. thin and watery and deficient In red corpuscles,
and this further irritates and weakens the
heart. . /
The most . sensible . thing to do for.' heart
trouble is to insure the digestion and assimila-
tion of the food.
This can be done by 'the rernlar use after
meals of some safe, pleasant and effective di-
gestive preparation, like Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, | which Â¦ may be found at most drug
stores and' which contain the necessary diges-
tive elements in a pleasant, convenient form.
Â¦ ' Thousands of people keep well and vigorous
by keeping their digestion perfect by observing
the rule of taking one or two of these tablets
after each meal, or at least after each hearty
meal. . . Â¦
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contain TJ. S. P.
pepsin, diastase from malt and other natural
digestives which act only on the food, digesting
it perfectly and preventing acidity, gases and
the many, diseased conditions which accompany
a weak stomach. :
-When Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are used
you man know you are not taking into the sys-
tem any strong medicine or powerful drug, but
simply â¢ the - natural digestive elements which
every weak stomach lacks.
So widely known and. popular have these tab-
lets become that . they are now sold ty - every
druggist In the United States, Canada, and Great
Britain. ' . - ;
Badam's . -Microbe Killer (It.
.M.K.) will cure you of- -CA-
TARRH. Bronchitis, Asthma. - Cold
or any kindred disease, as it has 'Â¦
cured thousands of others In this
% country. It is certain destruction
Â° to all forms of microbes and germs
. : of disease, to which are attributed
all the maladies mentioned. It not ;
only destroys them, but it aids the
system in repairing - the damago .
they have done. R.M.K. â¢" SI a

New York Stock Market.
KEW YORK, Jan. 9. â Speculation came to
a r.altlng place to-day and showed much hesi
tation about branching out Into new courses.
In the absence of important new developments,
the market followed the normal course in the
culmination of a speculative movement, the
pricÂ« vibrations becoming less by degrees.
Thtre were efforts, which persisted during the
greater part of the day, to contest the drooping
tendency of the market and to continue yester
day's recovery. The marking up of special
ctocks was the device resorted to. ~ It was not
very effective at any time, although there was
a rally at one time which generally wiped out
early losses. In the late dealings, however,
when the futility of the efforts of the bulls be
came apparent, tired holders began to throw
over stocks. Prices went to the lowest point
for the day and generally closed there. St.
Pail was under severe pressure and lost 2%.
Declines of between 1 and 2 points are numer
ous among the prominent stocks. The princi
pal etay of stocks during the time of the re
sistance to the decline was Manhattan. This
etock was taken on an enormous scale by bro
kers -who navÂ« been active In It ever since the
present advance began. The running of the
Unit experimental train by electricity over one
of the company's lines was the ostensible cause
of the stock's 6trength. Metropolitan and
Brtwklyn Rapid Transit were affected in a sim
ilar way. The action of the United States
Bteel etocks has proved a great disappointment
to a large element among professional specu
iatjrs, who have been looking for a sustained
lift In those stocks and an advance bull leader
ship of the market. Both classes of stocks
were eold to-day, both for home and foreign
aoiount. The hostile etepa etui In prospect
against the Northern Securities Company con
tinue to form a .repressive influence 'The
money market has lost its stringent tone, but
renewal of supplies is by no means so abundant
BM expected.

CHICAGO, Jan. 9. â Numerous bullish condi
tions conspired with yesterday's curb strength
to send wheat up by rapid Jumps at the open
ing. Continued reports of the desperate condi
tion of the winter crops from lack - of moisture
had as much aa anything to do with the situa
tion. Cables were up a little and receipts were

Wheat and Other Grains.
./ ..
WHEAT â The foreign markets ruled firm.
Chicago opened. firm and advanced. The
market was very active. Indifferent cables
were offset by decreasing receipts, dry weather
and heavy .country buying. Wires to Bolton,
De Ruyter & Co. from Chicago said - that the
country were still the best buyers, but there
were too many professional longs taking profits
for the bulls to hold the market up. Wall
street was a heavy buyer, there were free ex
port sales at Duluth and an Improved demand
for flour at Minneapolis. ..The Cincinnati Price
Current said that the plant was tender in some
localities, and that the farmers were selling
their live stock and holding their grain, prin
cipally wheat. In fact, - the Kansas farmers
now say that they will not sell another bushel
of wheat until the crop has more moisture, or
there is assurance of another crop. 1 In conse
quence all the mills in Southern Kansas are
idle. ' Â¦-
Toward the close of the session the Chicago
market became easier on - the announcement
that the Government report would be Issued
to-day, and that It i would confine itself to an
estimate of the average Â¦ yield per acre Â¦ and
the area of new winter wheat, giving no esti
mate of bushels.
This market was not materially changed,
though futures were higher.

That the milk was tampered with after
it was delivered at the McKee home there
is no doubt. The driver says he delivered
three bottles, as usual, between 2 and 3
o'clock in the afternoon. At 5 o'clock that
afternoon a woman who lives in the house
saw three bottles on the doorstep. An
hour later, when she I again looked, there
were only two bottles there. In addition

She feared to give it . to her baby, how
ever, and after replacing the stopper in
the bottle set it aside. --Â¦ Â¦'.,'Â¦)
The following morning, after her hus

pare more food with the milk in one of
the two bottles left at the door. She
tasted it, but s had no sooner taken one

her throat were burned and .blistered by

discover the subtle art of coming close
to giving a true etching effect. The at
tempt to find . it all out was at the San

Mark Hopkins Institute of Art, where
t-e artistic world paid all the honor in ltd
power to the photo artists by attending
in solid, fashionable body. All rooms were
thrown open and to' the strains of an or
chestra the privileged visitors marcheU
through corridor to balcony and from
room to room, but the one spacious cham
ber, with its platinum prints, sepias, car
bons on celluloid, bromides ana gum bi
chromate prints, hung in admirable or
der, was tne point to which all footsteps
were eagerly directed.
Landscape and portrait vie with marine
for honors, though in point of numbers
portrait assumes the right of recognition,
while on that score landscape and marine
about divide honors. The portraits might
become tiresome but for their remarka
ble excellence.

prints developed with a brush and show

Snyder has several admirable prints â
"Homeward Bound," "The Gleaner" and
"Gathering the Sheaves."

The committee finds that Hawks made
a claim upon Heistand for compensation
.for services, but the charge that Assistant
Secretary Meiklejohn guaranteed to
Hawks a position In the Government ser
vice in part settlement of this claim Is
not sustained by the committee, but it ia
found that Meiklejohn did In March. 1900T
appoint Hawks to the position of inspector
of the customs service in the Philippines,
which appointment was revoked by Sec
retary Root in the May following.
Other findings are:
That while Heistand was the projector
of the hemp company he was not author
ized, to represent the other Government
officials who were engaged with him and
it Is not ' found , that the tariff duties
would be adjusted for their benefit.
That the matter of the adjustment of
the tariff was never mentioned directly or
indirectly by Colonel Heistand to General
Corbin, Assistant Secretary Meiklejohn.
Assistant Attorney General Boyd or As
sistant Secretary Allen. -
That Heistand asked General Corbin to
take stock and that the latter first as
sen ted and then' declined.
, The' testimony concerning the charge
that Heistand had promises from Assist
ant Secretary Allen and Assistant Secre
tary Meiklejohn Is repeated without com
ment, but the following is added:
Â¦ "your committee further finds tha.tthe
Assistant Secretary of War. G. D.- Melkle
john has not used Government positions
for the purpose of paving private debts
of any officer of the Government."
The committee finds that the letter of
commendation of Hawks of date July 13,
1899. signed jointly by Colonel Heistand.
Assistant Attorney General Boyd and As
sistant Secretary Meiklejohn was not
sJjmerl officially bv t*eÂ§S* officers and also
that the words "the Government will look
with favor on the same." meaning the en
terprise, were not in the corrected copy
of that letter.' :
"It is," says the report, "impossible for
the committee to- divine Colonel Hei
stand's intention when he said: 'Of course
the needs of the future will be met as
they require,' referring to the Philippine
tariff."
The company then prepared a pros
pectus and a blank for the names of sub
scribers, but the incorporation of the
company never was consummated. The
committee finds that Heistand and Hawks
canvassed the possibility of interesting the
Government officials whose names are
mentioned in the resolution. . It is found
that Heistand wrote to Hawks In 1899
as charged, sending documents and mak
ing suggestions about the Philippine
tariff, but the committee says that these
suggestions are capable of different con
structions. - . .' Â¦ .
- .The report cites ; the charge quoted in
the resolution of < inquiry that Colonel
Helstand in 1899 was engaged in forming
a combination for the purpose of con
trolling the hemp product of the Philip
pines and that the names of Assistant
Secretary Meiklejohn, Assistant Attorney
General Boyd, Assistant Secretary Allen
and General Corbin had been frequently
mentioned by him as assoÂ«*ates with him
in the enterprise.
The committee finds that the charge
made in the first paragraph of the pre
amble to the resolution is not true, the
facts in that connection being that Col
onel (then Major) Heistand, about May,
1899, proposed to Major E. L. Hawks, who
had i been major of . the Tenth "Volunteer
Infantry, a scheme for - establishing a
manufacturing plant in Manila for .the
manufacture of the hemp product in these
islands and suggested to Major Hawks
to take charge of it, which offer the lat
ter accepted.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9.â The Senate
Committee on Military Affairs .to-day
unanimously 'agreed, upon a report In the
case making, charges against Lieutenant
Colonel H. O. S. Helstand of the army,
which was presented to the Senate by
Senator Cockrell of Missouri. The report
contains a concise 'statement of the facts
in the caBe as brought out by the inquiry
and casts no reflection upon any 'of the
officers of the Government whose names
were mentioned in connection with the
matter. â¢â¢â¢Â¦.Â¦. â¢
Faughman led a party of men into Brit
ish Columbia during the Fraser River ex
citement. For several years he was at
Virginia City. During the last twenty-five
years he lived In Oakland. He was one ot
the familiar characters about Seventh
street and Broadway. Only the wife, 75
years old, survives him and she Is In want
Faughman's life was identified with the
earliest pioneer days. He 'was born
seventy-eight years ago p.t Rocklin, Me.
Coming to California- In 1849, he went to
Tuolumne County, where in the troublous
days he served a3 a deputy Sheriff, earn
ing a reputation as a brave officer that
remained with him for many" ears.
"He was one of the most "courageous
men I ever knew." said former Chief of
Police Fletcher to-day. "I knew him in
the early days and he proved his courage
then." ' .
Deputy Coroner Quellen said:
There were wagon tracks across the fields,
showing where the team had gone from Forty
sixth toward Forty-seventh street. At the
creek bank the wheels made a sharp turn to
the right, as If the driver had seen the dan
ger too late and was trying to save himself
frtim going Into the creek. There was noth
ing of a suspicious character about the case,
eo far as I could see.
He left Cooper's grocery on Watts street
about 6:30 o'clock and was perfectly sober.
All night I searched In vain for him and
learned nothing until this morning:, when they
brought me the news of his death. I cannot
believe It was an accident.
He was at home at 6 o'clock, and left on
his wagon to deliver some goods, saying he
would, return at 1 o'clock. He always was
punctual, and when he had not come back at
7:30 I went out to look for him. -
OAKLAND, Jam &.â With the head and
body crushed and lying in Temescal
Creek under his overturned wagon the
remains of John M. Paughman, an aged
expressman, were found at 8 o'clock this
morning by R, II. Fallmer, residing at
694 Forty-seventh street, and J. I. Kelley
of Fifty-third street, The accident that
caused the old pioneer's death" occurred
last night after 8 o'clock, when Faugh
man was last seen alive near his home at
2045 Filbert atreet. He left there to de
livejr some bundles. The appearances are
that his horse either ran away with the
driver - or wandered across I the fields at
Forty-seventh and Adeline streets, plung
ing over the fourteen-foot embankment
into the creek. â¢
The wagon was upset and Faughman
was pinned under the overturned seat.
The horee was drowned, being caught by
the shafts and prevented from moving.
Fallmer and Kelley saw the wagon and
did not discover Faughman' s body until
they climbed down the steep incline
to investigate. The body was taken
in charge by Deputy Coroner Quellen.
Faughrnan's aged wife declares that her
husband met foul play. She says:
Ib Thrown Over a Bluff From
Wagon by Runaway
Team.

then extend the same Â¦ privilege to , all
Eastern companies and their employes
that are on the coast. . \ . .
. Representatives of the trunk lines met
the middle ! of last ' month in consultation
in the. East and decided that roads -west
of Chicago were reaping the most benelit
from the annual pass system. They ac
cordingly decided to shut t down thepass
list and pay cash fares for all their rep
resentatives who were traveling - for â¢ tna
company on, other, than their own roads..:
The roads west: of Chicago, not receiv
ing their annuals from the trunk roads,
collected fare from -all traveling passen
ger agents. It is supposed that the trunk
lines came to the conclusion that it would
be better-to call the matter- off.
The trunk lines have, decided: to- ex
change annual passes with all roads west

MISSION CITIZEN
SHOOTS HIMSELF
John Henry, Secretary o:
the Hibernians, Com
mits Suicide.
Inebriety and Trouble "With,
Sister-in-Law Are the
Causes. Â¦
John P. Henry, grocer at the corner of
Seventeenth and Howard streets, secre
tary of the Ancient Order of Hibernians,
manager of the California Broom. Manu
facturing Company and one of the best
known citizens in the Mission district,
ended his existence with a revolver yes
terday afternoon, shooting himself
through the heart.. *
Domestic trouble preceded the tragic
act. Two hours before the body was dis
covered the Buiclde fired two shots In
front of the house in which his sister-in
law resides. In a note found by the Cor
oner's deputies Henry blames this rela
tive for bringing the trouble Into his life
that led to his ending- It.
In the afternoon Henry visited the home
of his sister-in-law at 522 Shotwell street.
He went to bid good-by to the four young
children of -his deceased -brotheV, 'whom
he loved passionately. He did not see the
little ones for the reason that he com
menced a tirade of abuse and was taken
in charge by an ftfflcer and 6ent to tho
Seventeenth-street station. He promised
to refrain from repeating a scene in the
neighborhood and was discharged from
custody. I^ater he broke his promise to
the officers and went back again. This
time he fired the shots.
At 5 o'clock Henry was found' in his
room, above his grocery with a bullet
through his heart. The discovery was
made by W. P. McNally. a clerk in the
store. No one heard the fatal shot fired.
When Chief Deputy Coroner McCormack
and Deputy Brown arrived on the scene
they found the pistol beside the body and
the following note on a bureau:
Goodbye to all my friends. My sister-in-law
Is the cause of It all.
Ten years ago Henry's brother died,
leaving four children. The widow of the
deceased moved to John Henry's home
over his grocery store and remained there
until four weeks ago, keeping house for
the grocer and rearing her children.
When she left four -weeks ago it was be
cause of Henry's periods of inebriation,
which rendered her existence unendurable.
Since then Henry had drank consider
able and made repeated efforts to get the
children back under his shelter. Mrs.
Henry prevented this and the two had fre
quent quarrels.
