trip, but the weather was against hlnv He did not leave the bridge, except at

PRINCE VISITS TEE STIEEAGE PASSENGERS.
Every morning after oreakfast the Prince took his constitutional around the
deck two or three times among the passengers; in fact, he was throughout .the
voyage thoroughly democratic. An artist for an illustrated weekly had been sent
by his paper to accompany tho. Prince. He was passing where- the Prince sat in
:he rmoking room on Tuesday night when Prince Henry hailed him, took his hand
and invited him to pit at the' table vith the royal party, where he chatted for
nearly an hour. . â¢ . ?:,""â¢Â¦ Â¦
Captain Richter had offered the Prince the captain's large table in the center
of the grand salon, but the royal traveler did not care to cause the regular pa
trons of the liner who had been assigned to those seats any inconvenience, and
declined to change.
Prince Henry and party occupied a table in a far corner, or sort of -wing of the
main dining salon. A partition ran half way across, hiding a part of the royal
table from a portion of the main dining-room; but the Prince requested, that the
greater part of the partition be taken down and the wide opening.thus made was
transformed into an arch and decorated. The change- made, the Prince's corner
seem more like a part of the main dining salon, and the passengers facing his
ecrner at meals could see him and his party plainly.
The voyage was without special incident. Prince Henry was a most
Democratic passenger, and the big company of his . fellow - voyagers
united in declaring him an amicable, charming and unassuming gentleman.

LOS ANGELES, FebV 23.-Since the
present storm began !the rainfall in Los
Angeles has been 1.60 inches. Nowhere in
Southern California -has there ' been' a
fall of less than one inch.^ and. the Indi
cations to-night all over this section are
good for more rain. Â¦ Â¦
The. storm has come in time to save the
grain and hay crops, which in -the entire
south were threatened with destruction.
In many places even the second seeding
for grain which was done after-the long
! dry period following the November rain,
was in Jeopardy. Prior to. the doming of
this rain I orchardlsts generally had begun
to resort to irrigation almost as. generally
as during. the summer.. The sugar beet
men in the vicinity of Oxnard, and Ala
mitoK were exceedingly .>.. doubtful 'about
planting, but this rain has stopped irri
gation for the time being, and has made a'
large planting of beets; a certainty.
During: the past .fortnight' there > has
Â¦been some * loss among cattle V on the
ranges, but this rain will start feed grow-'
ing and no .further danger from this
cause Is anticipated. After the good rains
of last season large, herds of cattle were
shipped into replace the herds shipped
out during the dry - seasons of the Â» three
preceding years. These cattle, could not
be shipped out this season- on account of
the quarantine against "â¢ this section, and
cattle men were fearful:lest a dry Beason
would reduce. the, herds brought In. ,
If good rains- come between now and
the end of March Southern California will
have the best crops in' its -history.-.. .

-:.;.", Booms.-~
TA.COMA, Wash., Feb. 23.â For some
unknown reason two immense log booms
on the Humptulips River, near Hoqulam,
were blown loose by dynamite three days
ago. Between twelve and fifteen million
feet of logs were turned loose and are
now floating down the river into Grays
Harbor and becoming mixed with other
logs. The loss Is sustained entirely by
the Humptulfps Boom Company, which
.constructed large booms on the upper
Humptulips. where logging operations are
being extensively carried on. .
Two terrific explosions at the log boom
were heard Thursday, morning by boom
tenders, who were blown from their beds
some distance away by the force. When
they reached the bank of the river the
booms had broken loose and as the river
is running very high they could do noth
ing toward stopping the loss of the logs.
During the day they fished up a sack con
taining 131 sticks of dynamite and caught
another sack containing a large quantity.
Officers of the boom company believe that
several men discharged some time ago are
responsible for the dynamiting.

j Personally he was a man of splendid
presence and a fashion plate in dress. He
was not fond of work, and more especially
in the last few years it was almost Im
possible to secure him for an engagement,
even on the most liberal terms. Despite
his successes In the minstrel business he
tired of that branch of the work and
cherished a desire .to sing in concert.
None of these tours were particularly suc
cessful from a financial point of view. â¢
The news of Emerson's death was first
received in this city in a telegram from'
Toby Lyons, the Boston baseball man, to
Harry. Orndorff, stage . manager of ; the
Orpheum. Some.months ago Ferris Hart
man and others were talking of giving a
benefit for the veteran minstrel, but' for
some reason the matter was dropped.'
Among the songs which Emerson ren
dered famous were "Happy as a Big Sun
flower;".-"Are Ye There. Morlarity?"
Could I Only Back the Winner" and a
ecore of others whose titles would bring
a smile of joyous remembrance to thea

â¢ Emerson made a large amount of money
curing his stage career and commanded
the highest salary of any minstrel man in
the business, but he died In poverty. He
was lavish in the expenditure of his
money; and generous beyond reason. His
personality was charming, and theatrical
men discussing his death last night re

mimic, and off as well as on the stage al

Billy Â¦ Emerson . was one of the most
popular men In the theatrical business
who ever visited r the Pacific coast, and
many regrets were voiced at the news of
his death. San Francisco played a promi

greatest, successes wÂ«re made here. He
had the old Standard Theater on Bush
street in the seventies, and gathered
around him a coterie of singers and
comedians that for brilliancy and ability
has seldom been equaled anywhere.
Among them were Billy Birch, Charlie
Reed. Harry Wyatt. J. H. Frohman. the

presented the, members of his staff, and
the Prince gave each a hearty handshake

his cap in salute, and the members of his

It Is understood the conferences among
the Senators have shown the existence of
a considerable sentiment that the apolo
gies made by the South Carolina Senators
are not deemed sufficient, and that the
committee will require other , and . more
ample apologies to be submitted to it in
writing, with the assurance that such
apologies will be made to the Senate be
fore a report will be made to the effect
.that the Senators have sufficiently purged
themselves of the contempt of which the
Senate has adjudged them guilty.
The whole affair, as stated in the Sen
ate debate yesterday, is without prece
dent, and the Senate is now to make a
precedent In the matter of punishment
and in requiring sufficient apology. The
conferences to-day developed the fact that
the Senators regard the. problem. with all
the seriousness with which' they dealt
with it yesterday, and that they Intend to
take such action as, will prevent, if possi
ble, similar episodes occurring in . the
future. .
Senator Burrows is : chairman of the
Committee on Privileges and Elections.
He said to-night that, In advance of any
meeting of the committee, he could not
say what would be done, but he added
that the affair was of such serious import
that it must receive careful consideration.
It will be a day or two before the com
mittee meets to take up the resolution re
ferred to it by the Senate.
During that entire time South Carolina
will have no representative in the upper
house, and action upon several important
measures may be affected by the loss of
these. two votes.
WASHINGTON, D, C, Feb. 23.â The
topic of chief interest In Senatorial circles
to-dayâ In fact everywhere in official
Washingtonâ was the fight in the Senate
yesterday between Senators Tillman and
McLaurin of South Carolina. There have
been a number of conferences among Sena
tors as to what should be done to preserve
the dignity of the Senate and to manifest
its sentiment with reference to the two
Senators who violated its traditions.
While no plan of procedure has* been
agreed upon it is learned that there will
be very deliberate action, and it is said
to be more than likely that not less than
thirty days will elapse before the South
Carolina Senators are restored to their
full power as Senators, this deliberation in
their case being in the nature of a pun
ishment,, since they will not be allowed to
address the Senate or vote until 'no longer

In his ioom, put the other end In his

for it now, and says that he will not
renew tha atemDt.
He attributes his desire to die to de
spondency over the fact that his prop
erty is somewhat involved and he has
been unable to draw any benefit from it.
The most valuable piece of property
owned by him Is a ranch in Merced Coun
ty, estimated to be worth $20,000. Hl3
wife died in Minnesota last fall, and as
this was the homestead the management
of the property was thrown into the Pro
bate Court, pending the settlement of the
estate. It became necessary for Adrian
to secure the services of lawyers. First
he tried a Modesto attorney, who, he
says, proved unsatisfactory. Then he en
gaged a local lawyer to look after his
legal interests. According to Adrian, this
lawyer ! took everything that hove In
sight In the way of dividends as part
. payment for his legal services. Satur
day Adrian found himself without money.
He says he went to the lawyer and offered
him a pawn ticket for a watch on which
he asked an advance sufficient to pay
room rent. The lawyer took the ticket,
according to Adrian's story, redeemed the
watch and kept it, but refused to give
Adrian anymone^.
. Laboring under the despondency pro
duced by. this last unklndness, Adrian
concluded to end his troubles by killing
himself. He has many friends and ac
quaintances in this city who would have
aided ! him if he had made known his
condition, but his pride, he says, prevent
ed him asking for assistance. His home
is in Merced County, but he has been
stopping in San Francisco for several

and "Dixie" were played, creating great enthusiasm. The royal party, with the
Prince at the head of the table, cheered heartily, as did all the German passen
gers. At the request of Prince Henry "Yankee Doodle" was rendered again, and
it was no sooner finished than a request came from the same source for a repeti
tion of "Dixie." ' .
An American wondered if the Prince knew the meaning and history of the
two. "Indeed he does," said several American voices.
On Friday night the Prince left his own table in the smoking-room early
and joined that occupied^y George A. Armour and Allison Vincent Armourof
Chicago, Robert Bonner and Archie Harman of New York and Spencer Eddy
of the United States Legation in Constantinople. Allison Armour had been
introduced to the Prince- as a yachting man and this brought the whole party
together on commoi. ground. Prince Henry sat conversing "with this party of
Americans for two hours. He remarked that he had always desired to hear
some genulne v American plantation songs, and hoped he would have the oppor
tunity before he returned to Germany.
REMEMBERS BIRTHDAY OF WASHINGTON.
On Saturday morning he invited Mr. Armour and party, with whom he had
spent the evening- before, to take a look through the^ ship, and he explained
every part of the machinery to them as .an expert. Not one of the party had
said a word about its being Washington's birthday. After the hour of Inspec
tion the Prince invited them to his room, where he opened champagne.
"Now, gentlemen of America," said he, "let us drink to George Washing
ton." -' Â¦ "Â» - ,
The storm that stayed with the Kronprinz all the way across the Atlantic
changed the pitching motion of the ship to a terrible roll on Saturday morning.
Everything in the ship that was loose tumbled about and it was difficult and
dangerous for the passengers to move.
At the concert after the captain's dinner last night most of the amusement
was afforded by several members of the band falling over as they were play
ing. One singer was held on his feet by a steward and he had to be braced part
of the time by the other The piano had to be made more secure with
ropes, and two men steadied it. The passengers sat holding themselves securely
in the stationary chairs. -
The Prince put his autograph on ten of the concert programmes to be auc
tioned off for the benefit of the sailors. The lowest-priced one brought $33 and
the highest $94. ' Six huttdred and twent5 r -five dollars was raised from the sale,
but the auctioneer's energies were all exhausted In holding fast rather â¢ than in
the use of his voice. The Prince sat through the concert and applauded with
enthusiasm.
The Prince yesterday sent word to the five American newspaper men on
board that he would see them . in the afternoon. Baron Seckendorff, the
Prince's chief of staff, made the presentation and the Prince shook hands
heartily with each of them. Among- other things he discussed' with the news
paper representatives wireless telegraphy and its development and application
In the future. At the time the ship was nearlng Nantucket and when commu
nication with that station was established the Prince sent his famous wireless
telegraph message to President Roosevelt, by way of the New York Herald's

PAST OF POLITICAL PLOT.
Spencer EdcSy Tells Why Miss Stone
Was Kidnaped.
NEW YORK. Feb. 23.â Spencer Eddy,
first secretary of the United States lega
tion in Constantinople, who had charge
cf the negotiations for the release of
Miss Ellen M. Stone and Mme. Tsilka, ar
rived here to-day on the Kronprinz Wil
helm, lu an interview he said the brig
ands captured an American rather than
any other missionary because they be
lieved the Americans had the most money
and would be likely to pay the ransom.
"Did the brigands want the money for
themselves?" Mr. Eddy was asked. He
replied:
Xo, they did not. and that Is where the
American people do not understand this case.
It la entirely a political affair, and all the
people in Macedonia are in sympathv with
the kidnaping, for they believe it is a step
toward freeing Macedonia from Turkish rule,
the same as Bulgaria has been. The monev
they demanded <$10O,O00) was Intended fo'r
the Macedonian cause.
If we had been dealing with the professional
brigands who wanted money, pure and simple,
instead of the political ones. Miss Stone would
have been released Ions ago. It is very like
ly that this caDture was deliberated uooa for
a long time, and the victims selected were
considered best to serve the cause, when com
pared with those of other nationalities.
Do the Macedonians have any feeling of
enmity toward the missionaries?
No, they are rather friendly to them than
otherwise. They desired to attract the at
tention of the world to their cause and Inci
dentally to get some much-needed money. I
have every reason to believe they have given
Miss Stone and her companion in captivity the
v<?ry best of treatment. When Mme. T&illta'e
baby was born, she received the kindest of
treatment, from all we can learn. I have had
five letters from Miss Stone written In Bul
garian so her captors could â¢ read them. Â¦ and
they were masterpieces in cleverness "and
diplomacy. Miss Stone Is a very courageous
woman.
Won't Turkey attempt to punish the ring
leaders?
Turkey will have a problem on her hands
If she docs, for the Macedonians have risen
es one man in their determination to be freed
from Turkey, and . this kidnaping of the two
American missionaries may be called chapter
one In tieir dan for liberty.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Feb. 23.â Miss El
len M. Stone, the American missionary,
who, with Mme. Tsilka, was captured by
brigands in the district of Salonika on
September 30 last, has been released and
arrived at Strumitza, Macedonia, at 3
o'clock this morning. Nobody was at
Strumitza to meet Miss Stone, as the
brigands had eiven no indication where
they proposed to release the prisoners.
Mme. Tsilka. and her baby were freed
at the same time. All are well. Miss
Stone immediately made herself known
to the authorities. * :
The first news of Miss Stone's release
was contained in a telegram received by
Mr. Dickinson, the American Consul Gen
eral in Constantinople, from the Ameri
can Vice Consul in Salonika. The tele
gram gives no details of the release.
As Strumitza is near the Salonika-Us
kub Railroad, Miss Stone will proceed to
Salonika without delay.

WASHINGTON, D..C.. Feb. V 2lâAttor
ney. General Knox has delivered . ;to the
President his findings In the matter of
the charges filed against Arthur II.
Noyes. Judge of the second division of the
United States District Court of Alaska.
The charges allege lncompetency and
corruption, although, the Attorney Gen
eral says, the charge of dishonesty was
.not pressed. ,.:'->7;:.
After reviewing the case at length the
Attorney General concludes his report a3
follows: !Sr'
â¢ Â« Such was the end of this Nome lUlgatlon.
out of which has sprung so much complaint,
bitterness and Dublic scandal. After review,
it remains that the actual consequences of
these proceedings in the Alaska District Court
were to bring that court into disrespect and
to lmnalr nubile confidence in its wise and
impartial administration of justice. > .
In view of the foregoing-, and after the most
careful consideration, I have concluded:
First â That the appointment of a receiver
In the case referred .to. without notice to thÂ»
defendants, and the refusal upon hearinsr to
discharge the receiver, and the consequent
dispossession of the defendants of their prop
erty were not justified under the facts, the
pleadings and the principles of equity.
Second â That there Is no Justification shown
for the refusal by Judge Noyes to settle a
bill of excemlona at the Instance of the de
fendants, and for the refusal to allow tne-n
an appeal.
Third â That after an appeal had been al-.
lowed by the Circuit Court of ADpealÂ», aaiJ
the writ of suDersedeas had been served upon
Judge Xoyes. the plaintiffs and the receiver.
Judge Noyes* attitude toward the Â¦writ was
one of hostility and obstruction, which was
totally inconsistent with hla Judicial duty
toward a superior court and toward, the liti
gants seeking throuch that court reversal of
his Judicial action. -

In the course of his letter Mr. Carnegie states in
detail some of the objections Which his examinations
have led him to conclude to be valid against the
Nicaragua route. 'He -says: "It has curves of '4000
feet radius; the Manchester canal has nothing under
5000 feet, and yet tugs are required fore and aft of
every vessekthat tries to pass around these curves.""
In another place he says: "The commission esti
mates the increased cost of operating the Nicaragua
canal at only $1,300,000 more than Panama: This
is merely for operating, but what of; maintenance?
That is a; far more important point, and the longer
distance cf the Nicaragua route will of course entail
more replacement and repairs and: liability to disas
ter." By way of a' third objection he says:. "Sena
tor. Morgan arid our Southern friends believe that the
NicaVaguan route is shorter than the Panama/.but in
this I think them mistaken. The commission gives'.
thirty r three hours for: the passage. This'means day
light onlyâ nearly three days. It will be; found im
practicable to "pass through at night." ' Finally, l7e-
DESPITE the claims of various philanthropies
upon his time and his energies, Mr. Carnegie
has interested himself in the controversy con
cerning the isthmian canal route and has declared
strongly in favor of Panama against Nicaragua. In
a letter to Senator Platt of New York on the subject
he announces that he once subscribed $10,000 to a
fund got up to test' the ' Nicaragua route, but was
satisfied from a report made by General Ludlow that
the enterprise "was not to be thought of as a rea
sonable undertaking." He further claims to have
read every official report that has been made on the
subject, and says: "All have confirmed my opinion
that instead of. $200,000,000 it will cost $400,000,000,
and will not be a serviceable canal when finished."

Sir Robert Anderson, chief of the British detective
service, is quoted as saying recently that so far as the
police are aware there are not more than seventy
dangerous professional b'urglars in the kingdom; and
it remains for the public to decide whether that means
that the police have been vigilant enough to suppress
most of the bad "burglars, or that they have not been
vigilant enough to spot them.
It can hardly < be necessary to pbint out to intel
ligent men what the passage of such an' amendment
would mean to California. The scheme is an utterly
unjustifiable one. The. corporations, however, are
back of it and are going to make a strong fight for it.
Therefore the public must; be warned of the danger.
No' political convention Â¦ will ,dq its ; duty at this time
if it fail to c*idemn the scheme emphatically and
resolutely. r^---'
Â¦ The amendment is absolutely vicious.. It has not
one redeeming feature. If enacted it would estab
lish in the State a commission with something like
autocratic power over a large variety of matters,
many of which are of strictly local concern. It would
put five men in control of rates; and [regulations of
railways, sleeping cars, express companies, tele
graphs,; telephones, water, light, banking and insur
ance companies. Those five men would hold office,
one for . two years, .one for, f our, ; one; for si*, one for
eight- and one. for ten years. The successor of each
would hold for ten years. The first' set would be ap
pointed.by the Governor. ' 'Â¦ Â¦ â¢Â¦"...
As this is not a partisan issue it is liable to be over
looked by the > people when once the party cam
paigns begin. It is, therefore, all the more important
that public sentiment.on the subject be formed before
the campaign excitements hold popular attention to
strictly partisan questions. The amendment ought to
be condemned at every political gathering that takes
place in the State. A resolution similar to that of the
Iroquois Clubs should be included in every utterance
of any political party, so that the people may not
overlook the importance of defeating it ;on election
day. . â¢.'â¢'.Â¦"" . .
WHILE most pf the resolutions adopted by
the State convention of ..the League of
' Iroquois Clubs were naturally of a partisan
nature, there will be general gratification in that
which declares: "We condemn and recommend the
defeat of the Assembly amendment to the State con
stitution known as Assembly amendment No. 28, to
be voted upon at. the next State election, abolishing
various commissions and creating one commission
clothed with extraordinary powers." :
RIGHTFUL CONDEMNATION.
From the foregoing it will be seen that nobody
has cause for worry anywhere in the United States.
We are still on the crest of a wave ivhose shore is yet
to be descried on the horizon.
The city itself was never more prosperous. Popu
lation is increasing at a rate which has not been ap
proached for a quarter of a century and lofty buildings
arc shooting up on all sides. This will be a big town,
indeed, in two or three years more if the present 'rate
of growth continues.
As far as California is concerned the rain of the
latter part of the week practically put the State on
velvet It touched regions where it was most need
ed, giving the south and San Joaquin Valley the long
dt sired wetting. Good crops are now almost as
sured all ever the State, and with the usual spring
showers we will turn out an abundant harvest.
Everybody feels the beneficent effects of this rain,
which was a veritable tonic to agriculture and com
merce.
Wall street continues quiet in the main and would
have been without feature last week had it not been
for the bombshell dropped . into it by President
Roosevelt in the matter of the merger of the North
western railroads, which caused a flurry for a day or
so. But this vSts merely a flash in the pan, the inci
dent of a day.
The consumptive demand of the country showed
110 abatement. There was the same familiar call for
nil sorts of merchandise everywhere, the West and
Northwest sending in the best reports, as usual,
though the East reported an active demand for dry
goods, limited somewhat by the advance in cotton,
which rendered sellers less disposed to meet buyers.
The call for woolen goods was active, but shipments
of footwear showed a tendency to decrease, though
they are still 8 per cent ahead of last year thus far
this season. Hides are weak throughout the coun
try, but this is really the only important staple ex
hibiting weakness at the moment. The firmness in
iron and steel continues and pigiron has again ad
vanced in spite of the opposition of the conservative
elements, who fought the advance. The smaller
mills are buying freely, and this may cause a further
rise. Structural mills are generally sold up to Sep
tember, showing remarkable activity in building and
railway construction throughout the country. Gen
eral briskness in the heavy hardware trade is addi
lional testimony lo 'this effect. Railway earnings
show a falling off of 3.5 per cent thus far this month,
but this is wholly due to the great storms here and
there, which arc especially felt by. the railways. Prices
ior perishable goods and general farm products con
tinue high and some of them have still further ad
vanced, dairy products in particular. Eggs are so
scarce that San Francisco, is shipping them to Chi
cago, the Territories and Puget Sound in such quan
tities that our local market is remarkably well
cleaned up for this time of the year, and very strong.
Nevada is also drawing on California for hay, and
as Honolulu is also in this market for the same pro
duct the price has been kept up very well in spite
of the recent copious lains. The Southern States are
enjoying more activity in cotton than for many
months, zjad it the present inquiry continues every
bale produced will be needed. Thus it will be seen
that the consumptive trade of the country is remark
ably active for midwinter, and the gratifying feature
of it is that it is in these lines which put money into
the pockets of the farmers, on whose prosperity that
of the whole land depends.
STORMS and generally inclement weather con
tinue to interrupt trade throughout the coun
try, but in spite of this common midwinter
drawback business is reported in exceptionally good
shape almost everywhere. The bank clearings, it is
true, show a slight decrease compared with the same
time in 1901, bat it was only 1.7 per cent last week,
and considering the stormy weather and interruption
to traffic by rail and water was hardly worth men
tioning. There was enly one significant loss, and
that was at Philadelphia, 22.2 per cent. San Fran
cisco gained 28 per cent over 1901, Chicago 25.3, St.
Louis 20.8 and Kansas City 29.8. New York/ lost
5.8 per cent.
BUSINESS STILL BRISK
PERSONAL MENTION.
Only three lieutenants In tho British navy have been pro
moted to the quarter deck from the lower deck during the
past sixty years. They are James Webber and R. A. Cathie,
who earned distinction in Egypt and are "jubilee memorials,"*
and the- third, W. Sims, was a gunner at Ladysmlth. where
his heroic service brought to him the deserved promotion. Tho
promotion, however, stops right there, and they will remain,
lieutenants during their subsequent service. In the army con
ditions are different, for over 6000 enlisted men, have been
raised to commissioned officers and many have attained high
ranks. In 'the United States navy two gunners who- entered
the service as enlisted men have been raised to the grade of
ensign, and they are in the line of promotion and may reach
the rank of captain. They are H. B. Soule and Francis Martin,
and were commissioned July 30, 1901. >'-^/ -â_'- > ,''- 'Â¦-'
Two of the three 16,500-ton battleships building for .the
British navy are to be fitted with Babcock and "Wilcox boilers,
and the third is to have three-fifths power of these boilers
and two-fifths of the Scotch cylindrical type.
The British Navy League Is untiring in Its efforts to im
prove the material and personnel of the empire's navy and It
has accomplished some good results. The Admiralty has been
forced into retiring a- number of obsolete ships, the names of
which only swelled the list of the effective â¢ navy, hut were
only a source of expense and tended to deceive the public.
During the last few weeks six "death traps" have been
stricken bff the efficient list. They are all ironclads and In
clude the Temeralre, Agamemnon, Ajax, Orion. Gorgon and
Hecate. There are eight more Ironclads doomed to early re
retirement, including the Inflexible, Superb, Alexandra, Dread
naught, Sultan, Hercules, Monarch and Hotspur.

course of construction for the United States navy. > They are
denominated as 'â¢political ships'* and as "humbug ships," be
cause their designed speed of 16.5 knots Is far below that of
somewhat similar types in other navies. The Engineer goes
on to say that the patriotism of American shipbuilders is de
pended' upon to make these ships steam as high as 19 knots,
which Is still below the speed of vessels of that class in Ger
many, France, England and Japan. This criticism. Is hardly a
fair one, for the vessels with which comparisons are made
vary widely as to tonnage, armament and coal. The American,
ships were designed to carry good batteries and have a fair,
reliable speed,' while in the foreign vessels of less tonnage
excessive speed Is aimed at and efficiency of fighting Is sacrificed.
The experiment of crowding a ship with machinery, making
it practically a floating and boiler shop, has been
tried In our navy and proved unsuccessful. The Columbia and
Minneapolis, as well as the Cincinnati and Raleigh, are such
examples, for their phenomenal speeds of 22 knots for the
first two named dwindled down to 18 knots In 'actual service,
and the estimated 19 knots of the Cincinnati and Raleigh sim
mered down to about IS knots under the most favorable con
ditions. It is entirely unlike!? that the foreign high-speed
cruisers make a better showing. All these paper speeds, rang
ing from 20 -to '"24 knots, are deceptive. They are rarely hon
estly earned on the trial trip and never reached after entering
the service. For this and i, many other reasons the Denver
class promises to become ! a valuable addition, to the navy, as
the vessels will make good fighting ships, have fair speed and
a reserve power that will make them far" more reliable than
those of fancy speed, in which deterioration of machinery and
boilers speedily reduces their efficiency far below that of the
less pretentious craft , -v'- v
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
A naval station at St. Thomas, one of the Danish West
India Islands, is projected by the Navy Department when the
"United States shall have taken possession of the group./ The
strategic value of these islands is, the sole reason for acqulr-,
ing them, but there is some uncertainty about their value for
a naval station. The United States ship Monongahela had a
rather rough experience at St. Croix In November, 1867. when
a tidal wave caused by an earthquake carried the ship over
a number of warehouses, landing her in one of the streets in
the town of Frederickstadt. A receding wave lifted the vessel
and landed her on a coral, reef, from which the Monongahela
was launched after several months of labor and much expense.
Only five lives of the ship's company were lost. The Mononga
hela is still in active service as a training ship, her engines
having been taken out fifteen years ago, and she* depends
now solely upon her sail power as a means of propulsion.
The London Engineer of January 24 refers in uncompli
mentary terms to the six cruisers of the Denver class in
Twenty-seven vessels are in course of construction for the
United States : navy, on which 516,500,000 has yet to be paid for
armor and $13,768,000 for armament, making a total sum of
$30,268,000 to be appropriated during the next three years. The
list includes eight h/ittleships, six armored cruisers, four moni
tors and nine protected cruisers, the latter embracing six of
the Denver class contracted for in December, 1899. Of the
eight battleships only three, namely the Maine, Missouri and
Ohio, are likely to be completed within two years, while , the
five battleships, armored cruisers and protected cruisers aj-e
making' very slow progress and are' not likely to be completed
within a year of contract time. The four monitors, 4ue on
delivery one year ago, may be finished before 1903. _
The personnel of tbe Japanese navy and that of the United
States is about equal in number of officers and men, but
Japan has now four admirals against one' In our navy.
The Hashidate, a cruiser of 4277 tons, was the first vessel
of considerable size built in Japan. As a' matter of fact the
ship was constructed in France simultaneously with the Itsu
kushima, which latter ship was launched at La Segore In
1891, but the Hashidate was shipped. in sections to Japan, there
to be erected, launched and completed. The Japanese have
taken their time in familiarizing themselves,. with modern navy
building and ordnance, and with the dockyards now_equipped
have already built several torpedo-boats and will now build
the two cruisers above mentioned. The ordnance factory Is
turning out guns of all calibers, and with an armor and steel
mill, which is to be completed in a couple of years, the Japa
nese navy will be entirely independent of foreign assistance.
of the material j for the construction of these vessels
has been ordered from abroad, but the work will be done en
tirely with, native labor. The design of these cruisers Is an
improvement upon vessels of similar types in other navies and
excessive speed has been sacrificed for heavier armament and
coal endurance. .They are 334.5 feet in length, 44 feet beam and
displace 3420 tons on 16.5 feet draught. The motive power is
triple expansion vertical engines of 9500 horsepower, driving
twint screws calculated to give a speed of 20 knots, and the
armament consists of six 6-inch, ten 3-inch and four 2^
pbunders. The armored deck Is 2^ inches thick, the bunker
capacity is 600 tons and the boilers are of the Niclausse type.
TWO second class cruisers have- been laid down at the
Kure and Yukosuko dockyards In Japan. They are
named Nlitaka and Tsushima, and have been designed
by Ch:ef Constructor Satow of the Japanese navy. Some
Armorplate and Steel Mills Are Improvements Projected, ari Ordnance Factory Is in Full
Bast and the Navy Personnel Equals That of the'United States.

7 It is to be noted that in turning away from the
Western alliance the South .would not be forsaking
a fond wooer. Bry^n carried along with the South
ern vote in 1900 only four Western States, and their
votes counted for little in the electoral college. In
fact, the West shook the South long ago, and. there
is nothing for Southern Democracy to do but to get
back East as quickly as it can. The McAllister reso
lution may.be impertinent to Mississippi, legislation,
but it seems to be good sound sense for all that.
So the Mississippi plan is to go back to the East
arid ask 'Eastern Democracy to kill the fatted calf.
It has found in the alliance with the West nothing
to feed on but the husks of Bryan's eloquence and
nothing wherewith to clothe itself but the rags of
tattered banners inscribed with, the legends of "free
silver. It longs for better, food and more clothes.
<has; been tried, and it has been found to be a horrible
failure. It is right and proper that the South should
lead off and show to the East that it wants to get
back to. its old : moorings, as the South was the one
which took up the alliance witlv the West. ' No one
who reads the McAllister resolution, and , who has
any knowledge of the true status of the case, will
take issue with it for one instant."
It hardly seems right that a State Legislature
should neglect State affairs to do politics for Democ
racy, but that is a matter which concerns only the
people of Mississippi. If they like it, outsiders have
no right to complain. It seems they do like it. One
of the leading papers ofMh'e" State says: "The reso
lution .sets forth the true status of the case. The
Democratic party must make alliance with the East
It cannot hope to win "the West any more. This
For that purpose he has introduced into the Mis
sissippi Legislature a resolution declaring that the
Democrats of the- South are willing to co-operate
with the Democrats of the North and the East in
the adoption of a platform and the selection of a
candidate, "to the .end that the party may present an
unbroken front at the next Presidential election and
that better commercial relations may be promoted
between the two sections."
WHILE the Democrats of Congress are
drifting aimlessly along' among the cur
. rerits of politics, making no apparent ef
fort to decide upon a course of action for the party,
there are impatient souls -in, the South fretting at
the inaction and inclined to assume the leadership
themselves. One of these is Mr. McAllister, a mem
ber of the Mississippi Legislature. Wearied of wait
ing for the national leaders of his party to decide
something, he has turned away from the affairs of
his State and invited his colleagues to undertake to
formulate a national policy for the Democracy of
the South to follow.

Freshman Glee Is also behind us, but the
junior promenade and senior ball will

The admiring friends of Miss Kathryn
Robinson cannot bask in the sunshine of
her presence any longer this season. She
is getting ready to go East for an ex
tended trip, visiting cousins in Kentucky.
Before coming back- Miss Robinsori will
do \Vlrginla, Alabama, Kentucky ana
Louisiana, and "if you have tears pre
pare i to shed them now" for those she
will leave in her trail â the victims of the
dangerous lightnings of her eyes. After
her departure society will have to get
used to seeing Miss Herrm without Miss
Robinson. They are called "the two
Catherines," and their devotion and gen
erous consideration of each other is beau
tiful. They are much alike In style, tem
perament, frankness and popularity.
Speaking of the popularity of these de
butantes, I ought to confide a new story
about Katherine Herrin that la amusing
her friends. At a recent Sunday after
noon tea she was surrounded by the usual
coterie of men. When she went home the
entire group obtained her consent to ac
company her. which departure sadly de
prived the tea of practically all the eligl
bles. The happy debutante was quite un
conscious of her drawing power. She was
simply having a good time. A few mo
ments later the enthusiastic Katherine
reached her hrome and burst into the
drawing-room, presenting the several ad
miring guests to those already awaiting
her, adding, breathlessly:
"Collins and Brower will be here on the
next car!" SALLY SHARP.
Unfortunately he found in his first political cam
paigns that the constituency to which he appealed
delighted more in invective than in argument. He
began by. denouncing the aristocracy of his own
State and since then he has gone rapidly from bad
to worse. Had the Senate rebuked him emphatically
and firmly at his first gross breach of dignity and
decency' he might have been checked in a career that
|iÂ«s brought himself into infamy and his State into
disgrace. Now the climax has come.^It remains to
be seen what the Senate will do about it. If it act
properly Tillman will either reform utterly or his
career in the Senate will be short. :
There is, in short, nothing in Tillman's past career
nor in the environment in which he -was raised that
serves as an explanation of his conduct. His par
ents were wealthy enough to give him the advantages
of education and right training and they did it. l As
a boy before the war he had for a governess and pri
vate tutor in his father's home a sister of Chester A.
Arthur, who afterward became President ' of "" the '
United States. The war swept away; his' father!s for
tune and young Tillman had to begin life for him-_
sfelf '"without -â¢â¢a; college. -education.- He 1 became >'a
farmer and for a time plowed his fields by his own ?
labor! "For more than twenty-five years he was a
working farmer, but during that time was a diligent
student of books and is said to have acquired the
finest private library in his State. The revolt of the
"plain people" of South Carolina against the old
aristocracy brought him into politics and his success
was immediate. Up to that time there was irbthing
of the bully or the blackguard about him,' and he
gave promise of becoming a leader of whom his
State might be justly proud.
That is the Senator's explanation and excuse. It
is not only a slur upon his State and upon the Sen
ate, but it is absolutely invalid. There is nothing in
the office of Governor of South Carolina that unfits
a man for showing or feeling a proper regard for the
United States Senate: \ Tillman's predecessor in the
Senate,. Wade Hampton, had himself been Governor
of South Carolina,, but had not acquired there any
thing of the insolence and offensiveness which have
characterized Tillman.
With the exception of the toleration shown him by
the Senate Tillman has no excuse whatever for his
conduct. In his apology to the Senate he said: "I
have always esteemed it a'high honor and privilege
Â¦to-be a member of this body. ' I had never had any
legislative experience^ when I came here/and my pre
vious service as Governor of South Carolina for four
years had unfitted me in a measure to enter . this
august assembly with that dignity and regard-r-proper
regard, I will say, for its traditions and habits and
rules â that is desirable. I have been here seven
years. I have in that time learned to judge men with
a little more catholicity of spirit than I did when I
came here. I have found a great many persons here
in whose personal integrity and honor and regard
for their obligations as gentlemen I have implicit
confidence; but I have seen so much of partisanship,
I have seen so much of what I consider slavish sub
mission to party domination, that I confess I have
felt somewhat at a loss how to judge men who in one
respect seem to be so high and clean and honorable
and in another appeared more or less despicable."
In some respects the Senate itself is responsible
for the worst part of Tillman's offensiveness. It has
tolerated words from him which should never have
been tolerated and has encouraged him to go from
bad to worse in his career as a bully. In .the very
debate which led up to the fight on the floor of the
Senate, Tillman' had sdd to the Republican members
of the Senate: "Politically, you are the most in
famous cowards and hypocrites that ever happened";
and we are told in the reports that the statement was
greeted with laughter. For a long time past the
same sort of reception has greeted his insults. The
man has been permitted to say what he pleased, and
even encouraged , to go further and further until at
last he has lost all sense of Senatorial dignity or per
sonal self-respect and has come to delight in making
a blackguard of himself in every debate in which he
takes part. Â¦ â¢Â¦Â¦'
BY assaulting with blows a fellow Senator upon
the floor of the . Senate chamber during ari
open debate Senator Tillman carried his vio
lent career in that body to a natural andperhaps in
evitable-climax.- His -strange apology .made after
ward aggravates rather than diminishes the offense.
Beyond that outrageous assault he cannot go. He
has reached the end, arid either the Senate must ex
pel him, his State repudiate him or his fellow Sena
tors, for the preservation of their own dignity, force
him to such a reform of manners and language as
will render him a fit associate of gentlemen.

NEW YORK, Feb. 23.â The State De
partment has notified President Butler of
Columbia University of the receipt' of a
dispatch from Idlnlster Conger at Peking
giving full information as to the gift of
books and other material to illustrate the
instruction in Chinese subjects to be un
dertaken on the < new Dean Lun founda
tion. It appears that tha collection se
lected by the Foreign Office of China for
presentation to Columbia University is
known as the "T'3 Shu Chi Cheng."
It is the most comprehensive collection
of books that has been made in China.
The collection consists of over 6000 vol
umes, and treats of every subject known
to Chinese literature. The work was orig
inally undertaken by a commission of
eminent Chinese scholars appointed by
Emperor Kang Hal, who reigned from 1662

by an unknown miscreant. The animal
was discovered in the basement of the

from his pocket, and he immediately sus

into his doorway. Yesterday morning he
notified the police of his loss and gave an

l3L*zr 0 the seventh annual meeting of
the Interstate Coursing Club,
held yesterday at Union Park.
His great \ greyhound Sisquoc defeated
A. R. Curtis' Beacon, considered the fast
est greyhound in, America, for the rich
California Plate stake, a sensa
tional deciding course. . ? .Â¦-
Mr. Healey's Tiburon won the consola
tion stake for dogs beaten in the â¢. first
round of the plate, defeating Loyal Lad.
Of the last eight doga left in the Belle
Brandon challenge cup stake" yesterday
morning four were the property of Mr.
Healey. This stake finally! went to W.
Raught's Silver Heels, with J. J. Ma
loney's Topsy Turvy runner up.
The coursing was held" in. a drenching
rain, which fell almost without interrup
tion, throughout 'the day. The attendance
was large, the betting ring containing a
surging, jostling crowd which made loco
motion impossible. The spectators were
under cover, while the field officials, clad
iiv waterproofs, galloped about through
all the downpour. ,'."â¢' ;
Â¦Â¦ The feature of the card was the Cali
fornia Plate, which was won for the first
time last year by Palo Alto. Of the last
four dogs left , in the stake three were
f rcm the kennel of A. R. Curtis, while
SÂ»squoc mado up the quartet. With Bea
con, Rector and Anchor, it seemed the
honors must go to the San Jose coursing
man. Slsauoc -. and. Beacon won their
courses and were left to struggle- for the
long end of the purse.
' It was nearly dusk when they went to
the slips for the all-Important deciding
course. The betting opened with Beacon
a. Ito 2 favorite. The odds fluctuated be
tween 2 and 3 to 1. the bulk of the money
going in at the former figure. Slsquoc
had had 110 seconds' running up to. this
time to. 80. for Beacon:, When the hare
made its appearance and the dogs were
liberated Beacon at once showed the
speed. He scored five points before Sis
quoc joined in. It was give and ,take
then, first one dog and then the other
scoring. The hare was a flyer, and, after
running well up the field, he doubled back
toward the south side of the park. At
this time Sisquoc was doing all the work,
winning ultimately by a score of 17 points
to 12. The dogs ran 110 seconds.
The life of the hare was saved by Slip
per James Grace, who caught and tossed
the tired animal. over, a three-foot fence
where the greyhounds could not reach it.
Sisquoc proved himself the best dog in
the running, having a great flight of
speed and unlimited gameness. He will
meet Sacramento Boy in a special match
one week from next Sunday.
Mr. Healey and his friends are enjoying
a laugh at the expense of A. Orthwen, a
wealthy St. Louis man, who wanted to
buy the Petaluma man's , kennel. The
latter fixed a price of $1000 for some ten
greyhounds, including all those that dis
tinguished themselves yesterday. The
prospective purchaser has been backing
and filling over the matter and allowed
the sale to lapse. | The greyhounds won
$500 in prize money yesterday, and it is
doubtful if they could now be secured for
JoOOO. The saplings are among the most
promising youngsters ever seen here and
great things are expected of them when
they mature. >

The Chutes had a fair attendance yes
terday considering the heavy storm, "and
those who visited the popular resort were
well rewarded, for the vaudeville bill was
of unusual excellence. Wincherman's
trained bears, seen last week at the Or
pheum, made a big hit with the audience
tx the Chutes. Ella Burt's thrilling bi
cycle ride down the chutes. continues to
be a sensational attraction. The collec
tion of animals in the zoo was well pa
tronized.
"The Orient Express" was played for
th? last time at the matinee and night
performance at the Alcazar Theater yes
terday, good houses being present. To
night Crane's successful comedy. "The

â¢ *â¢ â¢
George Ober, the comedian. Is in great
favor with the audiences of the Grand
Opera House and his work in "A Tem
perance Town" caused the heartiest
laughter last night. This evening the
stock company will be seen in a revival
of "A Midnight Bell." one of Hoyt's b**st
comedies.
The so-called "pastoral" play, " 'Way
Down East." attracted a good-sized audi
ence to the Columbia Theater last even
ing. The production will enter on its sec
ond and last week this evening. Augus
tu: Thomas' play, "Arizona," is sched
uled to be seen at this house next week.
The final presentation of "The Ameer"
took place last night at the Tivoli and
was witnessed by a large audience. To
night the management will produce "The
Serenade" for the first time in America
at popular prices. The big success of the
Bcstonians should give the Tivoli com
pany every opportunity for scoring well.
Billy "Single" Clifford, one of the new
people at the Orpheum this week, was
called before the curtain last night at the
close of his turn and made -a neat speech
thanking the audience for its demonstra
live approval of his work. Josephine Sa
bel, who returned for a week, was as
lively and as pleasing as ever. Pathos
and burlesque are strangely intermingled
in the sketch entitled "The Absent
Minded Beggar," presented by J. C. Nu
gent and Grace Fertlg. The three Meers
:n their 'slack- wire feats were daring and
amusing. Warren and Blanchard have an
amusing musical number in which Is in
troduced several new and pleasing songs.
Among the old favorites, the Blossoms
presented some new comical acrobatic
feats and the Hawaiian Glee Club ren
dered several new selections in the plaint
ive melody -of their language. An entire
change in repertoire was given by the
Probyn Ladies' Quartet. Not to be out
done in variety, new pictures were flashed
on fhe screen by the biograph.
Laughter is king this week at the Cali
fornia, with the Irish comedians, Murray
and Mack, presenting a new edition ct
their vaudeville farce "Shooting tÂ«e
Chutes."' The piece makes no pretense at
possessing a plot, but serves as a vehicle
for a number of clever artists to exhibit
their diversified talents. There is plenty
of music and the play abounds with hu^
raor throughout its three acts. Onaries
Murray nearly has the audience in nys
terics with his grotesque motions and his
dance while sitting on a chair reading a
newspaper provokes much laughter. Ollie
.Mack Murray's diminutive partner, helpa
along the fun, and the turn of the two
comedians in a conversation song- and
dance is extremely droll. Edward and
Winnie Jolly are heard to advantage in
coon songs, and Kittle Beck, the 6ou*
brette of the company. Is a graceful dan
cer and sings well. Her song, "A Lessou
in Love," in which she is supported by
a double quintet of ladies, is pleasing: and
earned a recall last night". Gus Pixley,
v.iio was a madrigal boy in Emerson's
minstrels in the early eighties, plays Iho
part of a tramp and a.n anarchist in good
style. Miss Kaleryne Roberts as the
buxom German cook is well placed, and
the other parts are in capable hands.
Next week Anthony Hope's "Rupert of
Hentzau" begins a week's engagement.
Policeman Douglass happened to reach
the corner of Hardie place as Bergholtz
fell and the noise of the fall attracted his
attention. He saw Poggi, who was bend
ing over Bergholtz. turn and run along
with the other man to Kearny street. The
officer caught Poggi and shouted to sev
eral men who were at the entrance to the
alley to catch the other man, but they
maae no effort to. stop him anS he es
caped. ,
Robbery was undoubtedly their object,
as Douglass found a murderous looking
weapon in the alley which had evidently
been thrown away by Poggi after he had
struck Bergholtz on the head with it. It
is a piece of solid iron about a foot long.
One end had been packed with small
pieces of iron and leather sewed over them
Â¦to keep them In place. Pieces of clothes
line are twisted around the iron and fin
ished off with a hand loop.
Poggi made a statement to the police
yesterday. He throws the blame upon the
man who escaped, and says he was a
stranger whom he met in a saloon on
Kearny street. He said he had been liv
ing till a week ago at 418 Union street, but
would not say where he had been living
since. .He had been working for the
Union Canning Company from Christmas
till February 15, he said. The police do
not believe his story. He will be de
tained in the "tanks" pending the result
of Bergholtz's injuries. -
Bwgholtz's statement to the officers
yesterday- was that while standing listen
ing to tne Salvationists Poggi and . an
otner man stood alongside of him. One
of them spoke to him, but he did not
know what he said. After leaving the
army meeting he walked along Kearny
street and turned into Hardie place,
thinking it would take him into* Market
street. When he saw it was a blind alley
he retraced hissteps and some one struck
him on the head, knocking him uncon
scious.
John Poggi, the man who was arrested
by Policeman George Douglass, was taken
to the hosyital yesterday uy uougiass and
.Detective .ttioraan, ana jLÂ»erghuitz posi
tively identiiied him as one or two men
whorfjpoke to him while lie was listening
to the Salvation Army on Kearny street,
between Jackson and Washington.
Walter Bergholtz, fireman on the
steamer Titania, who was struck on the
head with a blackjack in Hardie place
late Saturday night, is suffering from a
concussion of the brain. He is at the

held their first joint memorial service
since the adoption at the session in Plac

such service. The ceremonies were held
yesterday afternoon in Golden Gate Hall,
Tvhich had been most tastefully decorated
for the solemn occasion. The disagreeable
weather did not prevent the attendance

to comfortably fill the hall. The stage

PROMINENT DRUIDS WHO TOOK PART IN THE MEMORIAL SER
VICES HELD YESTERDAY AFTERNOON IN GOLDEN GATE HALL
OUT OF RESPECT TO THE MEMORY OF DEPARTED MEMBERS.
MADRID, Feb. 23.â A council of minis
ters is in session here to-night to discuss
means tb maintain public order. .
The general situation is greatly im
proved. Several labor societies here have
declined", to join in- the strike. Official
telegrams declare that order prevails ev
erywhere in the "provinces. More troops
have been drafted to Barcelona, but it is
hoped that the worst of the trouble ia
over. The' strikers at Barcelona have de
mande,1 payment in full of their wages for
the pat>t week. The employers have re*
fused, these .demands,, except in a few
cases where they were acceded to in the
hope of conciliating the men. Following
the> advice of the captain general, many
factories at Barcelona have agreed to re
start their fires, though it is doubtful If
the men will resume work. The refusal of
the -authorities to liberate the arrested
strike leaders Is causing resentment, i Iso
lated riots are still reported.
At Sarria, a .village near 'Barcelona,
some men were " arrested for experiment
ing with expl9sives. One of these men
fired upon the police and a fight ensued, In
which one policeman and one workman

MANILA, Feb. 23.â A force of . native
constabulary at Santa Cruz, province of
Laguna, Luzon, has captured Cortez, sec
ond in command of the insurgent General
Malvar, and turned him over to the mlli-
Itary authorities. Cortez was in fancied
security in a suburb of Santa Cruz known
as Alipit, and was raising funds for the
insurrection. A friendly native Informed
Inspector Sorensen of this fact, and the
capture of Cortez followed.
Few Insurgents remain in "the provinces
of Batangas and Laguna. General J.
Franklin Bell has accomplished his In*
tended purpose of ridding this district of
Insurgents, though for the present the
Civil Commission considers It inadvisable
to declare the provinces In question paci
fied. ..
Large numbers of insurgents who have
been driven from Batangas and Laguna
have joined the ladrones in the neighbor*
ing province of Cavite, where the native
constabulary is bounding them from place
to place. General Trias, the present Gov
ernor of Cavite province, who formerly
bitterly opposed the Americans in that
district, has given proof of his frlendlu
ness, and is using every effort to run
down and capture the Cavite ladrones. Ho
is sending volunteer companies of bolomen
to assist the constabulary in suppressing
disorder. The natives of Cavite province,
provoked at the continued disorder created
by the ladrones, are spontaneously offer*
ing themselves in large numbers to assist
the authorities in , maintaining peace in
the province. The Civil Commission rec
ognizes this attitude, to be largely due to
the influence of General Trias.- Â»

Three Killed, in a Wreck.
ANTIGO, Wia., Feb.' 23.â A -head-on col
lision between freight trains occurred late
last night near. Summit Lake, < on the
Northwestern road, eighteen miles north
of this city. Fred Lyons and Roy Mitchell,
brakemen. i and-- Bert Nightsor, fireman,
were instantly killed and Harry - Hogan,
engineer, badly hurt. -â¢'.-Â¦
BERLIN, Feb. 23.â Various events dur
ing the past week occurred to dampen the
temper of the Boerse. The opinion of At
torney General Knox as to the legality of
the Northern Securities Company merger
gave speculators a warning -of caution.
The - semi-annual report of the Laura
Company, one of the largest iron and coal
companies In Germany, which shows over
2,000,000 marks of decreased earnings and
actual loss â¢ in the - iron departments,
caused all iron shares to weaken. Coal
shares also declined upon the growth of
difficulties in the coal market and the ac
cumulation of stock.
The money situation, together with the
high rates for the London carry-over 'and
the situation in Kaffirs, made a strong de
mand for English" exchange, which is now
near the. gold point. '. The export of gold
.to London Is regarded as probable in a
few days. Exchange on Paris Is already
15' pfennigs above the gold point. The
market showed little interest In American
securities and no disposition to buy. .
LONDON, Feb. 23.â The past week on
the Stock Exchange was uninteresting,
business being at a low ebb in all the de
partments. The borrowings from the
Bank of England increased by over Â£2,000,
000 during the week. This was sufficiently
discouraging, but the number of forced
settlements, of speculators who had
plunged beyond their means added to the
depression, while the publication of the
opinion of Attorney General Knox con
corning the Northern Securities Com
pany, which is in opposition to what was
generally expected, came as a decided
shock and' effectually checked speculation
in the American section. Confidence in
the soundness of the industrial position
of the United States remains unshaken,
but operators undoubtedly await the
clearing [ of the legal atmosphere* before
embarking on extensive and fresh deal
ings. The confident pronouncement of
Marconi concerning the possibilities of
wireless telegraphy adversely affected
cable shares.
â¢Detective Reynolds and Policeman Nel
son were detailed on the case and for
three days have: been trailing the man
now under arrest. After satisfying them
selves that they were Y on -the track
of the . right man the detective and the
policeman decided to take him into cus
tody. This they did last evening and in
his effects found two sacks of coin which
they -say" were ..taken from Phillips' sa
loon. . . '

WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.â In accordance
with the agreement heretofore reached,
the Senate will begin voting at 4 o'clock on
the Phiippine tariff bill. All the. time of
the day's session previous, to that hour
will be devoted to brief speeches for and
against tho bill; the time to be divided be
tween the supporters and the opponents
of the bill. The opinion has been advanced
that yesterday's episode between Senators
Tillman and McLaurln might have tho
effect of causing a postponement the
time for taking the vote in order, to per
mit Senators to speak who have desired
to do so, but there is no probability of any
change of programme. The Senate regards
a unanimous consent agreement as very
sacred and never allows anything to in
terfere with it.
According to the present programme.
Prince Henry will be < a witness of a part
of the ceremony of taking the vote on
the Philippine bill, and he will be allowed
to observe it either from the floor of the
Senate or. from the gallery, as he may
prefer Probably all the members of the j
Senate will be presented to him, but it I
is not intended that his presence shall in
terfere in any way with the prosecution
of the business of the Senate. .
The irrigation bill now holds the place
of vantage on the Senate calendar next
to the Philippine bill, and probably will
receive the attention of the Senate after
the Philippine bill is out of the way. There
is however, some impatience on the part
of the friends of the ship subsidy bill over
the present arrangement, and If the irri
gation, bill should consume a great deal
of time there may be an effort to displace
it. All will depend on the action of the
Republican steering committee.
The bill making appropriations for Con
gress and the different departments of
the Government will be reported to the
Senate during the week, and probably win
be taken up for action the next day, after
it is reported. ' , - Â¦ â¢
On Thursday the Senate will unite with
the House in the ceremonies in honor of
the memory of President McKinley.
The McKinley memorial exercises in the
Hall of Representatives on Thursday over
shadow the programme in the House this
week. To-morrow, when Prince Henry
visits the Capitol to look down on the
two houses of Congress, he will witness
probably an uninteresting spectacle so far
as the popular branch is -concerned, as
the House will be. working on District of
Columbia business. The remainder of the
week will be devoted to appropriation
bills, two of which are on the calendarâ
the postofflce and the diplomatic and con
sular bills. '.

OAKLAND. Feb. 23.â John B. Nisson,
assistant engineer of the ' creek route
ferry-boat Garden City, was killed by be
ing struck by the paddle wheel of the boat
while making an inspection shortly after
noon to-day.
The Garden City was in the slip at the
foot of Broadway, and Nisson chose that
opportunity for making an examination
of Ihe paddle wheel. He made his way
into the paddle box and .was looking over
the wheel "when the engine was started
and the big wheel made a few revolutions.
One of the paddles struck Nisson on the
back of the head, nearly tearing his scalp
off and fracturing his skull. The blow
threw him into the water, from which he
was rescued by the crew of the boat. 1 -
When taken out of the .water he was
barely alive, and died just as he was be
ing taken into the Receiving Hospital.
Mr. Nisson was 60 years of age and
leaves a wife and two childrenâ a son and
a daughter. He had been employed on
the boats of the Southern Pacific Com
pany for many years.

PHILIPPINE BILL
BEFORE SENATE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER. Feb. 23.â The control of a
woman's affections is not subject to in
junction, so Judge Mullins decided yester
day when a petition for an injunction in
one of the. strangest cases ever presented
in the District Court was dismissed after
a short hearing.
The petitioner for the injunction, John
Conlon, is a hostler -employed In a livery
stable on Market street. The defendant,
Charles Richards, is said to be employed
in the gambling house of Charles Segalj
at Lawrence and Nineteenth streets. Con
lon alleges: "That on or about February
1^ for a valuable consideration, to-wit,
$10. paid to the defendant Richards, the
latter agreed and contracted to introduce
him to. one -.Miss Etta Rice, described by
the defendant as a swell." Conlon naive
ly allows that he has but lately come
from Abilene, Kans., and is unused to
city ways. He paid the money and then
Â¦waited for Richards to perform his part
of the contract. The purpose of the intro
duction, Conlon alleges, was matrimony,
and further that Richards knew of his
intentions..
The presentation of Conlon to the young
lady was had at a masquerade ball given
at East Turner Hall by the fraternal or
der of Eagles, and here is what Conlon
says: "That in truth and in fact the said
Etta Rice was as described by the de
fendantâa swellâ and this plaintiff, fur
ther relying upon the representations of
the said defendant, did press his suit and
ieceived such encouragement from tne
said Etta Rice as led this plaintiff to ex
pend much money at that time and
since." '
Then Richards went "to Mlsa Rice, call
ing Conlon "Rube" and "easy money,"
thereby causing Miss Etta Rice to turn
cold. Conlon wants Richards restrained
from interfering with the course of true
love.

The British bark, . Inverclyde arrived
yesterday, 124 . days "from Liverpool. / She
left the. English port October 22 : and , ex
perienced favorable weather until Decem
ber 31, when a heavy southwesterly gale
stirred up seas that dashed clear over the
ship. One of these seas knocked 'down P.
Lv Thornton, an apprentice, and broke
his right leg both above and below., the
knee.. The youngster_was â¢ taken : af t and
made as comfortable as . the crude - sur
gery of unskilled hands would allow. Cap
tain Milne . put the shattered limb in
splints, but when the Inverclyde arrived
yesterday he. reported that â¢ Thornton's
knee was terribly swollen and that the
lad was in sore need Of that rest and quiet
not obtainable at sea.. He will- be re
moved to-day to St. Mary's 'Hospital.

Captain Hohnberg "of the schooner Sao
Buena Ventura | makes | a charge | against
the 'life-saving crew :< : at \Westport,; near
Grays -Harbor, .which amounts to an ac
cusation of inexcusable, neglect of
duty : or of cowardice, ; such Â¦ as Is rarely
found In the llfe-savlng.service of an An
glo-Saxon : band.. The . San ' Buena Ven
tura, left here a 'month ago and ; reached
Grays; Harbor, after' a rough voyage' of
eleven days. ; She . anchored - Just .; outside
the harbor. Hardly had her anchor, taken
holdwhen r a violent -storm came up. So
suddenly did the gale break that Captain
Hohnberg and his mate were;thrown.vio
lently,, to >the deck and several; members
of; the crew sustained injuries more ' or
less severe. ' The * storm continued all
night, v An additional anchor was let go,
but- even with this extra hold the vessel
repeatedly ' dragged. All night long sig
nals: of distress were flashed. The .West
port Â¦ life-saying station was within . sight
of â¢-. the Â¦ imperiled : sailors. Â¦{. Not the Â¦ least
attention; however,' was . paid to the ap
peals for help; ; ; The rockets must have
-been visible, for. miles around and could
hardly, have escaped [ the attention of the
Westport station. Captain Hohnberg con
cluded that the life-saving ; lookout â¢ was
asleep or that the crew, was afraid to faco
the .turbulent ~ sea. -Both anchor chains
-parted just before '.. daybreak ' and Â¦ the
schooner drifted to 'sea. Captain Hohn-
Derg.-says ho will never forget that drift
ing over .the. bar.t The vessel was unman
ageable and; they ; had to trust absolutely
to the mercies of the 'elements. They
reached open = water Â¦ and for two weeks
cruised about' in the vicinity of the har
bor unable on account of 'the weather to
re-enter. . -The San Buena -Ventura finally
crossed the bar last Wednesday and is
now loading lumber for this port. Cap
tain Hohnberg, inthe interests of coast
ing seafarers, has asked for an investiga
tion of: the action. of the Newport life
saving -station in ignoring his signals.

The barber's cry was heard by several

sum of money and a' watch on him, but
the robbers- failed to get either the money
or timepiece. . . .
The two blows dealt Holdsworth by the
thugs ' greatly shocked : his nervous sys
tem and he was unable to attend to his
work yesterday. The side of his face is
also abraised, and it is not improbable
that one of his assailants gave him a
parting kick before running off when he
heard assistance coming. . Holdsworth

between Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth,
when the assault took place. â¢ â¢.;<â¢ ;
Several daring robberies have been com

thugs have been futile. It is believed
that the robbers are strangers here, and
that they came in from the country to
spend the winter. Holdsworth is unable
to give any description of his assailants,
as he was taken unawares and did not
get" a view of them, as they came at him
from behind. The first blow so dazed

Holdsworth was walking along Fourth

when the robbers sprang on "him from a

from behind . with a club or "billy." â¢ The
blow landed on ; Holdsworth's neck, with
sufficient . force 5 to fell him to the side
walk in a half-dazed condition. When
Holdsworth was falling he intuitively
put his hand to his -watch pocket. He
struck .face -downward on the sidewalk,
and one of the thugs quickly -rolled him
over on his back to get at. his "pockets.
Holdsworth, although half-dazed, tried to
get up, when he was struck another blow,
this time above the right eye. Holds

before the second - blow landed, and then

Gang of Four Burglars
Placed Behind the

One of the Men Makes Con
fession of Crimes Com
mitted.
A Quartet of crooks, who, the police
think, are responsible for a number of
burglaries committed In the Western Ad
dition, were arrested yesterday morning
by Detectives Ryan and O'Dea and Police
Officer Lloyd and locked up In the City
Prison. They gave their names as Harry
Smith. Thomas Kelleher, Thomas Schln
kie and John Brown. Both Kelleher and
Smith are well known to Captain. Sey
mour's men, . .i- $ .
Late Saturday night Smith arid Kelleher
broke Into the Del Monte dairy atx2U5
Pine street and stole twb bottles of cream
and a cash register. Oriicer Lloyd was ap
prised of the crime and he started alter
them. After searching for them for more,
than an hour he ran across the desperate
pair on Pierce street. r They showed tight,
Dut fearing the policeman's revolver sur
rendered. A "jimmy" was found In . the
possession of Kelleher.
Shortly afterward Detectives Ryan 'and
O'Dea tound Brown and Schinkle in a
lodging-house south of Market street.
After being taken to the City Prison
Schinkle broke down and confessed to sev
eral burglaries committed by the quartet.
Some time before an entrance was ef
fected to the dairy the desperate fellows
broke into the residence of F. Trledman at
111A Franklin street and stole a revolver
and a lady's black silk skirt. From the!
house of Mr. Triedman tne four went to':
the residence of John Peabody at 1506
Larkln street and after forcing an en- ;
trance got away with two gold rings be
longing to the servant girl and $23 In sil
ver. An entrance was effected by prying
open the rear window with a "jimmy."
Another house In the same vicinity was
also entered by the burglars, but nothing
of value was taken.
After dividing their spoils Smith and
Kelleher separated from their companions,
intending to "crack" a residence on Pine
street near Fillmore. Becoming thirsty
they broke into the dairy and stole the
cream, for which crime they were ar
rested.
The cash Â¦ register, . Jewelry Â¦ and silk
ekirt which were taken by the house
breakers have been recovered by the de
tectives. . .
Some time ago Kelleher and another
crook were arrested for burglary. Kelle
her pleaded guilty to petty larceny and
was 6ent to the County Jail for six
months. His partner in crime stood trial
for burglary and was given ten years in
San Quentln. The four men will be
formally booked on several charges of
burglary to-day.

THERE were a large number, of
"Wrecks in the vicinity of the Cliff
House yesterday, caused . by the
high- southeast wind: that blew
with a velocity of twenty, to thirty
five miles an hour. .'- .
The wrecks were a source of amuse

and each disaster was met with peals of
Hearty laughter.
There was no loss of life, however, for
the wrecks consisted of umbrellas owned
by members of the fair sex and their es
corts. The few people who " ventured out
to the ocean beach were rewarded with a
eight of tumbling, boiling waters that
dashed over the roadway leading to the

Pedestrians who walked up the road to
the Sutro Heights ran- the gauntlet of a

seemed to concentrate all Its energy.
