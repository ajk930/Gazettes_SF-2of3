At 4 o'clock a novel-reading band of
girls flock in every day. They read a
novel a day, and sometimes two. "Oh, I
dread the effect of so much romance on
these unformed minds," said the librarian.
"It will tend to make them dissatisfied
with their position in life. It will tend
to de-classify them, I am afraid."
To the type that say, "Couldn't you
pick me out a good book? Anything will
do," the "Pilgrim's Progress" Is always
offered and has never been accepted. An
old lady once looked the book over and
said: "I've got a copy of this home, but

Gratitude is a noticeable trait In these
people from the old men to the boy whom'
the librarian has helped wtih some ques

waited around the desk on his way out
till the librarian was at leisure. "Did you
get what you wanted?" she asked.
"Yes, ma'am, and I am very much
obliged to you. I want to thank you for
your trouble."
... "That's what lightens the labor and

An indefinable mental bond exists be

whom she has to untangle somo"
knotty questions. She has smoothed tha

superior to his tools, and a good librarian
must be the key to the whole library. His

"There's a girl in there who wants a
translation of the nineteenth century,"
said the boy who runs errands and helps
around the library. On inquiry it devel
oped that what the girl really wanted
was a. translation of the nineteenth chap

"Now," Eaid the librarian to this little
fellow she had undertaken to train, "this
is the 'Iliad.' an old Latin book. See?
And this," holding up another book, "is
an English translation of it. What she
wanted was a translation of the nine

"Scratching pests are still used in Scot

One of the most romantic of the lot was
that of little- Naomi von Schmidt. Those
whose memories date back as far as the
Midwinter Fair can recall the story.
One day a handsome, well-dressed
young man took a baby to the day nur
sery, the creche, at thn fair.
He went to Miss von Schmidt, who was '
In charge of the creche, and told her that'
he wanted to leave the baby^ there for a
little while. His manner was natural and
did not excite any suspicion.* Other peo-'
pie were doing the same thing all the
time â that was what the creche was for.
So the matron received the baby and
accepted the handsome young father's
casual explanation all In good faith.
He was to be back in a little while.
"What the matron considered a little -while
slipped by and the. man did not return.
Perhaps he had elastic ideas of what a
little while was.
Finally it came to be unquestionably a
long while and no sign of him. The day
went by and the next day, and through all
the days that followed he never put in an
appearance.
But the *baby didn't care. She was as
plump and happy as a babf need be and
she kicked and. crowed and gurgled to her
self. She was very young-^-only about a
monthâ and she had not learned to worry j
about what was to become of her.
She was well taken care of. She was
such a delightfully Â¦ grood-tempered baby
that everybody liked her. Miss von
Schmidt came to like her better and bet
ter and before she' knew it she was lov
ing her and she began to hope that the
father never would come back.
â¢ He never did.
"Wealthy citizens became Interested In
the baby and they started a fund for her.
This gave her a start in life and finally
Miss von Schmidt decided to adopt her
and it was in this way that the young
lady. Miss Naomi, aa she was now called,

that, prettiness always does add.
She has had all the good care that a
baby can want in her adopted- home, but

The construction of the canal will be thÂ©
greatest factor In the development of all

some of the spots of land made by the ex

Towns will spring up along thÂ© route of
the canal, as in the case of the railroad

"For South America the Panama route
has , the advantage of being much
farther south and furnishes a shorter
route between . North Atlantic ports and
the west, coast of South America. The
Panama route would seem .the best .'also
because, there are less undetermined
quantities In its construction. As to the
matter of labor there wouldbe no serious
difficulty encountered on either route? At
Panama native labor, which is practically
the Jamaica negro, would be almost en
tirely used. Any conditions produced by
active work on the canal need not neces
sarily interfere with the health -of those
employed, at least not to a large extent.
The difficulties heretofore experienced In
that respect had grown largely out of in

must certainly be jettied, as two dredges

"One of the principal advantages of the
Panama route seems to me to be the fact
that not only is the route a feasible one,
but the conditions to be met in actual
work have been to a very great extent
fully determined by work already done.
I went from Colon to the Culebra cut by
rail. The canal was called finished a dis
tance of twelve miles from the Pacific
side and twenty miles from the Atlantic.
This work, according to the Colombians,
cost $120,000,000; but the commission has
roughly estimated the cost of a sea level
canal at not less than $240,000,000 and the
time required for construction at not less
than twenty years. So for these reasons,
if none others, a canal with locks is pref
erable.
"Much water Is required for the width
and depth of this canal, and the Inten
tion is to put in locks, though I
think if the Panama route is chosen it
will ultimately be made a sea level canal,
which could be done. But that would take
more money and time, and so five artifi
cial lakes or locks are to be constructed
to take care of the difference in tides.
"There seems to have been no con
tinuity in the work so,far done. Spots
have been selected where the excavat

it would make the biggest showing. : The
harder work seems to have been left,
except in the case of the Culebra cut,
where the nominal work is now going

the most expensive work must yet be

through American enterprise. Greytown
Is a small place, having a population not
exceeding 1000 souls, but it Is more of a
town than many of the larger towns In
the interior, because it is alive.
by the same act adding: vastly to our
own national commerce and prosperity by
giving opportunities for the enterprise of
our own people right at our door.
Another conslderatidn which ought not
to be forgotten for one moment Is the
fact that through this low pass of fifty
or sixty miles in width across- the con
tinent the breezes from the Caribbean and
the Pacific play unceasingly. There are
no calms on land or sea near the points
where the shipping would enter the canal.
Ships would approach and depart under
sail whenever desired without delay;
whereas the Panama route Is in the Una
of tropical calms at both termini. This
is a matter on which, of course, accurate
knowledge can only be obtained through
systematic and scientific nautical' obser
vation, but the same story came to me,
upon inquiry, from so many intelligent
seafaring men along the Caribbean coast
that scarcely the Nautical Almanac would
take It out< of my mind or destroy its
emphasis as a fact important to shipping
Besides, the 'nautical authorities do con
cur. Vessels long becalmed off Colon or
Panama are a thing of common occur
rence. But no vessel lies becalmed off
Greytown, which is. at the mouth of thÂ»
San Juan River; nor at San Juan del Sur
on the Pacific side. To steamers this, of
course. Is unimportant, but there Is a
far cry between this day and that In
which the sailing vessel will not be on
the seas and playing an Important part
in the commerce of the world.

there Is no better way to ' do this than
through the .women's clubs, which are
only, in their lncipiency and are destined
to be one of the powerful factors In the
lives of women. - . . â¢
All women do not marry; of those* who
do not many have more time and thought
to give to club work than -women with,
families do, and they may be of great
help ' to their club. We should not only
think of what we receive, but what we
can give our club. The lesson, of service
Is always a sweet one. .
The time has passed for. xntjn to sneer
at or discuss women's clubs, i It is very
rare to find, a -husband -of a club woman
who Is not Quite as willing for. his wlfÂ«
THE SECRETS OF THE STARS MADE CLEAR TO YOU.
QsHE | club woman Is " the . man's
I woman." , ,
I So says Mrs. Annie Little Barry,
.1 president of the Corona Club. Being
. JL a club president, she ought to know.
But she is flying in the. face of tradition.'
If the comic papers know anything about
it, then is the club woman a being dread
ed of man and shunned by him.
"The. club woman is the man's woman."
Mrs. Barry Insists upon it. She will not
have it for a minute that the- flyaway
and frou-froped lady, the one of whims
and wiles, is what man is after. She says
he wants something more substantialâ the
good, wholesome. bread and butter of Ufa
rather than the dessert.
Mrs. Barry . certainly must know some
thing about men I as well as clubs. She
has a ' husband and she has brought up
five boys; when her own supply gave out -
she took to nephews for the sake of hav
ing boys about her. â¢>â¢â¢ .. â¢
She says they like her, and it isn't hard
to believe It. She radiates healthy good:
temper. Whether the club Is responsible
for this Is another question. , >
She has always had literary Interests.
When she was a little girl, only a mite
of. a youngster, on a New England farm
she used to .run away when it was time
for school or time to be dressed for din
ner, I or even time for dinner itself â think
of it!â and sneak out to the barn and bury
her little nose in a book or scratch la
boriously with a pencil writing out some
ot | her own childish ideas. She keeps up
her. story -writing now,, and she Is pretty
sure ' to , have a boy somewhere In every
tale she writes, for she evidently doesn't
think much of -any book . or home that
pretends to do. without one.' " Â¦ .
The -literary, end of the club work la
what interests her. 'She devotes herself to
this as much as possible in the time left
over after her official duties are attended
to. She is preparing a paper now on the
poets of America, and she has' gone so
far into the subject that she Is resurrect

BEST-KNOWN CLUB WOMEN ON THE PACIFIC COAST.
Let a woman once become Interested in
her figure, appreciating its passible grace
and proportion, and she Is not lightly or
without reason going to give over the
study of its possibilities, nor will she be
satisfied until she has acquainted herself
with its measurements, in order to see If
she approaches the proper Ideal; and then
to apply this knowledge gained where It
may do the most good. The woman who
does not number an anthropometric chart
among her possessions is quite behind the
times. The height, the breadth, the
depth, the girth of one's anatomy must

JL Zenobia in her own defense, it
would be worth while for every
woman to repeat occasionally, for the sake
of the mental and physical tonic thereby
Imparted. Please try the experiment,
Clorinda. It will help to establish you In
the possession of beauty of form which
may make you adorable, even If beauty

are first steps toward acquiring grace of

Callipers, a breadth stick, a height stick
and a steel tape measure are necessary,
anÂ§ although one can take one's- own
measurements, the assistance of a per
son who has had experience in these-mat
ters is valuable. In making an; inventory
of one's inches, it is necessary to take
them in the same position of the body,
and in the same way; perhaps twice a
month or oftener one wants to find out
if there has been a -gain or loss, and re
cord it on the chart. The height' may be
taken with or without shoes; without
them Is better; stand erect, close to a
wall.

to ten pounds for clothing, according to
the season. . â¢ â¢ .
Chest inflated â Take as full a breath as
possible, and measure close under the
arms.
Chest naturalâ Also take measure close
under the arms.
Waistâ At smallest part.
Upper-armâ Around the largest part,
with the arm bent up until the hand near
ly touches the shoulder.
Forearmâ Around the largest part, with
arm extended and .ftst closed.
Hips, thigh and oalfâ At largest part of
each.
Shoulders, breadthâ Arms at sides, th-e
measure being taken about two inches
below ends ot shoulder blades.
(To get this measurement will require
assistance.)
In the accompanying illustration, num
ber two; the reader sees a' young woman
who possesses almost a perfect or classic
figure, and her physical 'measurements,
inspiration . should take m place chiefly
through the nose, with the mouth shutor
only slightly opened. .- -These' exercises/t
should be taken in the open air, when
weather permits, or In a very well ven
tilated room, free from dust, and neither
close nor damp. The windows may re
main open, even in the severest weather,
if there is no draught.
It Is utterly useless for a woman to
go in for development- of the figure un
less she first learns how to hold up "her
head. She cannot be well and strong, or
as well and strong as she should be. with
a drooping chin, nor can she be beautiful
and interesting unless she holds her head
up. It is a wise plan to practice daily
tipping 1 the head back as far as one can.
holding the chin up high, rest there for
a moment, then stand up straight again â
the exercise is taken In a "standing posi
tion; repeat this several times. This also
makes the back of the- neck strong and
shapely: it- expands the chest by making
it stand out fuller. To make the chest
large and full not only . improves the
looks of the person, but it may add years
to life. : - V ~
An addition of three inches to the cir
cumference^of the chest, Morgan tells us
In "University Oars," implies that the
lungs, instead of â¢ containing two hundred
and fifty cubic Inches of air, as they did
before their functional activity was ex
alted, are now capable of receiving three
hundred cubic Inches of air within their
cells; the value of this will be admitted.
Suppose one la attacked by inflammation
of the lungs; the possession of enough
lung tissue to admit forty or fifty addi
tional cubic Inches of air will suffice to
turn the scale on the side of recovery. It
may be the means of recovery.
Not only this, but with the head -well
held up. and the chest expanded, heart,
stomach and other vital organs have
more room, so that they can work more
freely. It gives a feeling of strength and
vigor which is exhilaring.
Now look on the other picture; with
the .chin drawn downward, the chest be
comes small and flat, and the lungs and
stomach are cramped until they become
weak and unfitted for the work they ar*
expected to perform.
Some one has said that it is a pity
we are not obliged to walk a mils dally,
carrying a half dozen pounds or. so of
glass on a tray on the head, and which
must be paid for If broken. Heads would
bÂ© carried very erectly In this case and
figures would become Junollke.

The hat of Easter sets, ;
Its brim a mass of tulle and leaves. :
Its top of violets. :
THE Easter hats are In the windows.
If you doubt this, go take a walk
along the shopping thoroughfares
and gaze into their glassy depths
and F<?e for yourself.
There is a saying- among common folk
that the first hats of spring are there
only to be gazed upon and that no one
ever really buys them and wears them.
LiKe most old sayings, this has come to
be utterly routed and refuted and replaced
by a new one. The Easter hat. as shown
In the first windows of spring. Is there
this year to be sold, and afterward worn,
and well Is it worthy Its exalted destiny.
What is more, it is to be sold earlier
this year than for seasons: and it is now
the style to have a spring hat much be
fore Easter, one that can be worn later,
while for Easter there Is reÂ«rved the
brilliant piece of headgear.
TV- bright the Easter hats may seen.,
and too large and too wonderfully trim
med, but the brilliancy may be partially
explained away under the supposition of
contrast. The winter hat was dark an!
the Easter hat is light. Seen together,
one following the other directly, the hats
of Easter seetn too bright for good taste,
but later, when all are wearing them,
and the colors are rivaled by the rays cf
the sun, they trill seem none too loud.

Hats in black and white, bats with tops

necessarily Inconspicuous, for some of the

The New Umbrella.
It is time for the spring umbrella. So
far the pearl handle holds its own, par
taking of the fancy for pearls. It Is a
cFear white handle and comes. very cheap
ly. One can get quite a variety in tha
pearl handles.
One cf the pearl handles shows a knob
of silver; another shows a very wide flat
handle of pearl, bound with silver along
each edge. A third pearl handle has its
little crook, with little silvered trimmings.
The wide, flat pearl handle now ieada in
favor.
Silver may be the metal of spring, but It
is not a showy metal. Its virtue is that
it is cheap, and one can have that which
is known as the real thing without paying
too much for It.
But silver will never be as decorativ*
as gold, and even the filled pold is more
to be counted upon, from a standpoint of
effective gowning, than silver.
The tri-cornered hat Is out in a new
style, which threatens to draw a certain
clientele its way at Easter. It 1b turned
up at each side and at the back, so that
the front -comes down low over, the fore

A lovely hat " of this description was
boxed and marked with the name of Mr*.
O. H. P. Belmont. It was In yellow satin
straw, so open as to need a lining. It
was in braids of most fancy-' design. Soft
pink cMfton peered through, the open
xnesbes.
The trimming under the brim will trail
upon the hair and it will be, if not a bird
trimming, then flowers. The bird that
poises' under the brim is very pretty, but
the flower treatment Is best for spring.
The chiffon scarf is good under the â¢brim
and Is very graceful as it sweeps . the
waves of the coiffure.
Trailing* Trimmings.
The Easter hat In certain of Its-vari
eties will be turned up at one side. The
hats that are turned down In front and
turned up at the back will be Been, but
by far the most popular hat will be the
one that has its side tilt. The perfectly
round bat, with its small curling . brim,
is made to tilt by an arrangement of
bandeaux.
On the contrary the very large hat
should not be worn by very short people
or by those with very small faces. The
immense hat is reserved for immense
height, and,> as the inches. of the girl di
minish, her hat should grow smaller. The
.small, compact toque Is the prettiest for
la petite.
There Is a tendency toward the three
cornered hat and the brim of the hat is
turned sharply up at one side and draped
with bands of velvet ribbon, to give the
effect of a trl -cornered hat, tied with gold
cord. This Is really pretty and very chic.
Unfortunately the hat that turns back
from the face is not becoming to many
and cannot be worn by those of more
than a certain age. Once past the de
butante period, or once over one's finst
two seasons, then the hat that turns
back from the face reveals too much and
gives a mature look to the brow, whicn
Is not to be tolerated by those of good
taste.
Fow will be the small, hats. Hats will
project, if not over the face, at least over
at one side, so that the appearance of a
large hat is preserved.'
For an Easter brim drapery there will
be many a chiffon length used and many
a bit of tulle veiling. The veiling, as it
is known, is a little heavier than chiffon
and is covered with French dots. The
French dot is made of velvet and is dif
ferent on opposite sides of the veil, white
on one side and black on the other.
The dots upon one heavy cream colored
veil were gray on one side and red on .be
reverse. Upon another they were black
on one side and cream colored on rae
other. Still another showed black dot*
on we side and turquoise on the other.

To the woman who makes her hat this
cormr.e Easter it can be said, "the milli
ner if your best friend."
It is one thing to be economical and an
other to bruit it abroad. Fortunately it
is not now necessary to publish one's
necessity to the world, for hats can be
made, as well as purchased ready made,
and the hats of Easter, some of them,
seem specially designed for the woman
who must put odds and ends together to
make her a chapeau.
It Is one thing to look at an Easter hat
and another thing to purchase it. It is
the thing, of course, to buy, and those
who have the money should lose no time
In laying it out, but there are just a few
who have to think twice before they
spend once, and yet who are of t that
proud build that does not want such a
fact to be too apparent to the whole
world.
flowers are treated. One of these Is quite
deserving a place in the highest art gal
lery of dress records of this century as
an . artistic achievement. The fabric, or
the foundation upon which the flowers are
treated. Is a blue satin of high finish.
A yard of Spanish lace is purchased and
the flowers are cut off the lace. There are
Spanish laces ! that are very coarse and
that show big open roses. This is not the
true lace of Spain, but it is the color of
Spanish lace and feels like It. the same
satiny touch and the shiny outside; so it
passes -for real Spanish. x Â«X
After the flowers are cut out they are
appllqucd under the satin at short inter
vals, and the satin is cut out on top of
the lace, or over it. leaving the raw edge
of satin on the right side. With a needle,
now, an embroidery design In white silk
Is used, so as to outline the flowers.
There can be a catjtltch of silk or a
more -fancy one, the object being to se
cure the lace roses well In place. Around
the whole there is now worked an empire
â¢wreath. Or a little i lace â¢ can be sewed
around the whole, to look like an empire
design. ' This .fabric is used for the over
dress of" an evening gown and for the
bodice.
. In employing so delicate a material, and
one that involves so : much handiwork,
there is an opportunity for ingenuity. Tho
underskirt can be long, but the overdress
need not be so lengthy. It can fall just a
little below the knees, to meet the flounce
which is on the drop skirt and which be

THE EASTER HAT AND THE EASTER MUFF'By Captain of '- Detectives Seymour.
WHERE MOST OF THE HOLD-UPS TAKE
â¢ , PLACE.
By District Attorney L. F. Byington.
An officer upon a warrant Is Justified ln killins; one accused of felony If
he resists or flees. A kllllnr to prevent an escape after a felony actually
committed is Justifiable.
In making arrests in misdemeanors and in civil suits, life can be taken
only where the party arrested resists by force, and not when he merely
escapes.
A citizen may Justify the taking of life when necessary to prevent the
commission of a felony. To justify homicide there must be reasonable
grounds to believe that a felony is about to be committed. A citizen has
the right to kill ln the prevention, but not in pursuit.
The footpad has absolutely no rights when he commits an overt act.
THE LAW FOR POLICEMEN, CITIZENS
AND FOOTPADS.
Â¦ the unit tlmo calling; out that I was an
officer.
"Lucky for you I called out first before
firing." said the druggist when hÂ» rec
ognized my voice, for It was he who,
hearing; mÂ« ln thÂ« store, had rrabbed a
gun and rushed out from another room
prepared to shoot.
"The door had been left open quite by
accident and In line with my duties I
was obliged to investigate. Had I been
ln uniform he could have recognized mÂ«
at a glance outlined against the show
window, but as I was ln citizens' clothes
any other man in his position miyht have
shot first and called out afterward.
Still another view is taken of this sub
ject by Attorney Stephen Costello, who
was accosted by one of Henderson's iranc
on the night they .killed Policeman Rob
inson.
"I wasn't armed that night," he said,
"but I am now. and if I was held up a
second time i think I would shoot, unless
there were circumstances to prevent It.
"I can't too strongly condemn the prac
tice of officers wearing citizens' clothes
Instead of their regular uniforms. Both
Joseph Pedro and Policeman Robinson
would be alive now but for that fact.
Criminals will never fight policemen in
uniform. Instead they always give them
a wide berth, and Joseph Pedro would
not have run from Crackbon to hla death
If he had been ln uniform. As It Is now,
no one feels safe at night.
"As an illustration of this let me cite
a .little incident that occurred shortly
after these double tragedies. At the lodffo
I attend the regular business of the even
ing was almost completely lost ln the
discussion of the recent hold-ups and thÂ«
shooting. Suddenly some one asked how
.many men were armed, and fully 95 per
cent of those present produced weapons
and declared they would use them. That
shows how much the men of the- city are
wrought up over these affairs."
On the other hand, Rlx N. Hamlin,
who was held up by Nelson and Davis at
Jackson street and Van Ness avenue and
robbed of two dollars at the point of a
pistol, says that if he were held up again
he would submit just as readily to the
ordeal as he did the first time.
"Talk about using a pistol is all right,
but when a footpad has a gun ln your
face you're it. that's all. Of course I
would never be startled at being accosted
by a policeman ln citizens' clothes. You
can tell them by their walk, by their car
riage, by their manner. In fact, I don't
think their clothes makes much differ
ence one way or the other."
On the other hand, Samuel D. Palmer,
who was recently stood up by a lone
highwayman, who stepped suddenly from
a doorway, thrust a pistol ln his face and ~
relieved him of $7. presents another view
of the case. â¢ \
"It I were held up a second time I
would do the same thing over againâ
quletlv submit." he said. "I don't go
armed now for the reason that I might
shoot an officer In citizens' clothes -who
happened to stop me. Instead of a real
rootpad. How Is one ROlng to tell the
difference In the dark?"
And so on the whole the question of
what you would do if you were held up
by a footpad Is still a perplexing problem,
which every man must answer for him
self, with the chances apparently very
much against him. no matter how hÂ«
acts.
the right to stop any citizen whom he
may think is acting in a suspicious man
ner 'and require him to give an account
of himself, where he lives, what his busi
ness is, /where he has been and where he
Is going, and if the answers be not satis
factory . he has the right to search the
man he has stopped, of accompanying to
the address he has given as his home and
of taking him to the police station for
further investigation and a closer search
If the circumstances seem to warrant It.
In view of the tragic death of Joseph
Pedro, what is a "citizen to do when he is
accosted by a policeman in citizens'
clothes? How is he to -tell that he really
Is a. policeman and not a footpad? These
questions were put to Chief Wittman.
â¢ Easily enough," he answered. "Every
officer is obliged to call out that he la a
policeman and to exhibit his star when
approaching any one on the street while
ne Is ln citizens', clothes, and no good cit
izen will refuse to stop and answer all
questions honestlv and frankly.- He will
be glad to tell who he is, where he lives
and -what he is doing, and. he'll be proud
"The rights of the policeman are the
same as the rights of the citizen..- The
rules of the Police Department require
him to carry a revolver, but he is not al
lowed to use it except in defense of his
life or to prevent the commission of a
felony or" the escape of a man he has
seen commit a felony or a man whom he
is sent to arrest on a warrant. He has
fortunate enough to be held up,you won't
suffer much Ios3. And, as E s&id before,
because the 'footpad counts upon" boldness
and surprise as the chief elements ln his
attack, it is best to walk close to the
outer edge of the. sidewalk to guard
against sudden attacks from dark door
ways or blind alleys. When the highway
man observes that you are on your guard
he is likely to fear that you- are also
armed,^ whether you are, or not, and to
give you as wide a berth as you are en
deavoring to give him. Besides, the outer
edge of the sidewalk gives you a wider
field of operation, If a chance offers for
effective resistance and you decide to take
advantage of it.
to know that the officer Is so wide awake
to his duties. No; no honest, upright cit
izen is ever afraid of an officer. Ordin
arily it is only the criminalâ the- man who
knows he is guilty and has something to
answer for â who runs away."
â¢The possibility that the darln* footpad
might adopt the same methods and mas
querade as a policeman, which was feared
by Joseph Pedro and which is a jrowin*
dread with hundreds of other men and
women, was suggested to the Chief. Ha
laughed at the possibility.
"Why," In all my years of experience
in the Police Department I have never
yet heard of such a, thing," he said de
cisively. "No; that is the very last thins
any one needs to be afraid ot The foot
pad would be taking too many risks.
He might find that the man whom ho
had stopped was a bona fide policeman
- "And we want the footpads to hold up
the poUcemen. That is one of the rea
sons 1 1 ordered them to wear citizens'
clothes. If they would only stand up a
few officers we would soon clear the city
of the vicious ' element. Another reason
was that the citizens* clothes were abso
lutely necessary, r not only; to. catch the
footpads, but" to capture burglars -and
those guilty of grand larceny as well.
"When the^ men are in uniform with
the star ln full display they can be dis
tinguished for blocks even on the dark
est nights by their general outlines, if
by no other signs. The thieves know this
and lay low until the otlicer has passed
along his beat. Then, setting a man to
watch him, they have a clear field to
operate. -The policeman, even after ha
has detected them, has no chance to
Bneak up and catch them unawares.
And they are too clever to be taken any
other way. They would know him for
what he is at a glance, and, as he can
not use his revolver except ln extreme
cases, they are sure to escape.
"If he only suspects them and attempts
to follow them ln uniform, they are on
their guard at once and can keep them
selves at a good distance ahead of him
ready for Instant flight at the first alarm.
But in citizens' clothes the thieves cannot
detect an officer so readily and he has a
better chance of stopping and searching
them for weapons or the tools of their
craft before they even suspect who he
Is. In this way we have caught some of
the most expert and notorious burglars
in the business this year. " â¢
"With so many hold-ups and burglaries
taking place, the only recourse was to
order the policemen into civilian dress.
You can easily see the wisdom of that
for yourself. The policeman, however, is
taking more chances than anybody else,
for he may be held up as a private citizen,
or he may be shot as an officer when he
makes known his identity, as Policeman
Robinson was."
Policeman Taylor, the hero of the fight
with "Kid" Goucher, "Brownie" and Hen
derson of the "Wegg" - gang, supplies
good evidence of the possibilities of this
latter phase of the case. He is a tall,
fine looking young man, with a clean-cut
lace and the supple figure of a college
athlete. Dressed < in a fashionable over
coat-and a broad-brimmed Alpine hat of
the latest design," he might be mistaken
for anything â¢but^-a policeman. He was
asked how the officers liked to be on
duty in citizens' clothes.
"Not very well," he said. V'lt is like
a horse" accustomed to the harness. One
feels very uncomfortable without the uni
form. Of course, it has its advantages.
One can get closer to suspicious charac
ters without causing alarm, and the
chances of catching a criminal unawares
are much greater. But it has its risks,
for one is liable to be shot by a footpad
or a burglar, as a private citizen as well
as officer, or to be shot by the private
citizen as a footpad Instead of an officer.
"An adventure I had the other night
illustrates this. I found the door of a
drugstore at Sixteenth and Market streets
, wide open. At first glance It looked as
if the place had been entered by bur
glars, for where a light should have been
burning the place was ln absolute-dark
ness. I waited awhile to Bee what was
doing, and then, fastening back the lapel
of my coat under my star to keep It in
plain view, I cautiously entered the store,
and, after groping about a few moments,
struck a match to light the gas.
"Instantly came the order "Throw up
your hands!' Instantly I obeyed, and at
Following co quickly upon the heels of
the murder of Policeman Robinson, this
second tragedy thrilled the city with
Then followed the shooting of Joseph
Pedro, an inoffensive citizen, recently ar
rived from the country, by Policeman
Joseph Crackbon. also of the Mission
District, of whom Pedro stopped to in
quire the way to his home, as re was
completely confused as to his where
rbouts. Crackbon, who was in citizen's
clothes, had been watching the young
man's strange and uncertain actions for
tome time and decided to investigate, but
when Pedro heard the announcement th3t
he was confronted by a policeman he

that he had a criminal to deal with,
Crackbon called upon the fleeing man to
halt, and when Pedro, who was gaining
rapidly and seemed quite likely to dis
tance h'.s pursuer, did not stop, the po
liceman fired, as he says, at the ground,
but the bullet hit the fugitive 1b the
back and he was found several hours
later, lying dead upon the sidewalk more
than a. block from where be had made
his escape.
A little over two weeks ago Policeman
Robinson of the Mission district was shot
and killed by three members of the
"Wegg" gang, the worst fraternity of low
desperadoes In the Middle West, who are
little known here, but who have been
driven to San Francisco from their
haunts in the East through the combined
Influence of the vigilant police and the
severe v.inter weather. Robinson's death
was the first murder in a long series of
hold-ups, and when the sensational de
tails of the affair became known the peo
ple of the city were thrown into a panic
of. fear and dread. If the thugs were
growing vicious enough to kill even the
peace officers themselves, what hope wis
there for the ordinary unarmed citizen?
It was to catch such murderous foot
pads as these that Chief^of Police Witt
man crdered all policemen in the out
lying districts to go on duty in citizens'
clothes after midnight. That order went
into effect just a few days before the new
year. . â¢
The Judges in their turn have been try
ing to help the police make themselves
the terror of evildoers by passing long
sentences on men convicted of highway
robbery. During -the r>aÂ«t three months
nine notorious footpads have been sen
tenced to serve out terms ln Folsom and
San Quentin aggregating over two hun
dred years for the beggarly theft of $135 50
which represents the combined plunder
of the whole desperate gang. One man
will spend twenty-five years in. San Quen
tin for a hold-up which netted him abso
lutely nothing. " Another thug, who
knocked his victim down and robbed him
of $100, the largest amount' secured ln sny
hold-up this winter, only " went . half a
block with the spoils of his crime before
he was caught and lodged in Jail. Hia
trial and conviction were speedy and he
is now serving fifteen years in San Quen
tin.
This remarkable congestion of the Jails
aroused the Grand Jury to action, and
the foreman. Colonel Charles Sonntag,
went to the Presiding Superior Judge and
asked him to assign four more Judges to
try criminal cases.
The prisons are so densely crowded with
men and women awaiting trial that the
police complain that they have been
obliged to abandon several important
roundups of vagrants and other undesir
able elements that are looked upon with
Euspidon because there is no place to
confine them during the long periods that
must elapse before they can be brought
to triaL.
Of robberies alone more than "a hundred
have been reported and nearly fifty ar
rests have been made for this crime since
the first day of November. In the same
three months over one hundred and fifty
men and women have been taken prison-,
ers and locked upon innumerable charges
of burgla.ry and grand larceny, which the
police say are all so closely allied that
many of the accused are guilty of a!l
three crimes.

cony to see if he can find his sweetheart.
The lovers finally discover each other
and sit on the steps of the balcony to
talk over old times and their present
bliss, filled with alarm the while lest
Dolores' father and Don John's brother,
the King, should discover them.-
The King has decided upon a royal alli
ance for his brother, and Dolores* father,
as a loyal follower of the King, would
not have his daughter aspire higher than
"an honest Spanish gentleman." The lov
ers have an evening of trouble, and fin
ally the King is thwarted and the lovers
triumph. Thus goes the dialogue of this
love scene.
Doloresâ It is true you are unchanged.
Your eyes look Into mine Just as they
used to. '
Don Johnâ Why should they not unless
they're changed by weary waiting.
Doloresâ Ah, waiting! We have not
waited, 'twas but yesterday you went
awayâ to-day you have returned. The
time between was nothing. Just as empti
ness to me â time vanished and forgotten.
I thought you might be changed. They
were great years for youâ you rained
your victories and, with the self-same
ease as once, one day, you won my heart.
Don Johnâ Was It one day?
Dolores â It was one day I knew it. *
Don Johnâ What beauteous day? Ah.
tell me.
Dolores â One day I was alone, and sang
all day. Wherefore this song? ; I asked
myself. The answer was, "Don John."
The answer and the song I sang both
meant the sameâ Just wordless melody,
whose every tone was love.
Don John: â I never knew the day I did
not love you. Before that ,time I never
lived, and if I gained my victorles,so easy
it was" because I wished them over., with
to hasten back to you. Sit by me here:
let me hold your hand. Where is my ring?
Dolores â It is here, quite near my heart.
I do not dare to wear It openly save in the
dark of night. Â¦ â¢
Don Johnâ And here's my roseâ the spot
less flower you threw me.
Doloresâ Alas! I threw it not: I would
not have dared. It was an accident.
Don Johnâ An accident? . . .
Dolores â It knew you were a hero, and
fell and bowed Its head.
% Don Johnâ 'Tls best we marry quietly.
Doloresâ Ob, I promise you that; I'll
DID you ever try to discover a logi
cal reason for the great gulf be
tween love in vaudeville and the
legitimate? The difference is very
striking, if you will stop to con
sider it, but why should there be one kind
of love for the varieties and another for
the drama, since 'tis an anxiom that all
love is very much alike the world over.
And yet the distinctions are as pro
nounced as traditions among the actor
folk.
In vaudeville all love scenes are rated
according to their value as mirth pro
vokers. The divine passion must never
be anything more serious than a jest, and
it may be as broadly farcical as the
actors can make it. Love, Indeed, is the
most frequently burlesqued of all the hu
man emotions, and the most successful
lovers in vaudeville are those who show
their affection by saying the most un
complimentary things about each other.
In the legitimate the other extreme
finds highest favor and they love best
"who pay each other the highest compli
ments. Of course there are grades be
tween.
If you go to the Central Theater this
week or any other of the fifty-two weeks
In the year you will find love a strong,
fierce, primitive emotion, greatest of all
the virtues, scorning utterly all subtlety.
The hero and the heroine love each other
with a constancy and earnestness that is
only surpassed by the villain's hatred of
both of them through four long acts of
melodrama.
At tha Alcazar or tha Grand Opera
house you will find still other grades. It
may be either the passionate tempestuous
ardor of a Sapho or a Zara, or the vola
tile, coquettish fancy of the heroine of a
French farce. There Is more of art and
.more of complexity, uut always there are
the extremes. -
At the Columbia or the California thea
ters the stage lovers rise to higher, if
more repressed, flights of fancy. Note
the romantic ardor of the hero and hero
ine of the "Pride of Jennlco" last week
or the Impassioned wooing of Charles Dal
ton In the "Sign of the Cross" this week.
Or study the love scene between Viola
Allen as Dolores and Don John of Austria
In the second act of "In the Palace of the
King." It Is the very essence of sweet
sentiment seriously expressed and sounds
particularly captivating even in print.
Dolores' father has commanded his
daughter to go to her room and stay
there, since she has tossed a rose to the
great Don John of Austria, who has just
returned from the wars of Granada, and
so, as the father says, has become "the
scorn of all the court." Dolores leaves
the great hall of the palace, saying "For
him a Queen; for me, what? And yet he
has my letter near his heart."
Then Don John conies back from the
chapel to pick up the rose and is. dis
covered by Dolores, who has lingered at
the door. Don John kisses the rose, puts
make no noise about It till 'tis done: and
then, I fear my heart will break all
bounds and finding voice, will sing it to
all Spain.
Don Johnâ What says this letter? I'd
rather you speak the words than read
them.
Doloresâ It say*â I cannot, find tha
words, try as I may. "I love you" seems
inadequate!
Don Johnâ You stole that phrase from
Â»Â«. / Â¦ . . â v ;Â¦â¢ ' r ....
Doloresâ I think I wrote it to yon first,
and then you wrote it back to me again,
and then it says "Come in the early even

For the necessary contrast In these .ax-

Wee tots of all ages in dainty cos

"The play's the thing" has been quoted
oft and aptly, but in these daya^if scenic
splendor and gorgeous costumes the play
er, her modiste, her milliner and her Jew
eler, would seem to be of far more im
portance. In the columns of criticism of
Mrs." Patrick Campbell's New Tork debut
in ! "Magda" her dresses received the
greatest attention, the first act gown
especially.
It was a powder blue satin, made with a
bodice similar to that worn at the time
of Marie Antoinette. The sleeves were of
lace, trimmed with tiny diamonds, and
the bodice was of brocaded silver and
treraes of love in vaudeville and the legit
imate, here is a scene between Kelly and
Violette at the Orpheum. Their billing
and cooing is the usual stage quarrel of
the varieties set to music, with much
more of refinement than is usually found
necessary for a rousing good vaudeville
sketch.
The picture is eloquent of exaggeration
from, the yum -yum pucker of the lips to
the mock gallantry of the poses. It is
the end of their sketch â the reconciliation
after the quarrel â which Is executed In
the words of a song they sing al
ternately and in concert. One verse and
the chorus will be enough to point the
moral of these contrasts.
I wan' to tell you now, I got a wife.
She's de bestes' g-al -what was.
I i<ald to her. "I'm groin' to take a stroll."
She says, "I don' care what you does. Â¦

No, you need'n' come home.

Tn the same way the coronet worn by
Marcia "Van Dresser, e3twhlle prlma don
na of the Bostonians and now leading
lady for Otis Skinner in "Francesca da
Rimini," is creating a greater furor than
her acting. It is a copy of the coronet
worn by a Countess of the fourteenth
century when she sat for a mosaic medal
lion, which Skinner found a few years
ago in an Italian museum. Needless to
say it is a creation of regal splendor
poised nightly on the dark locks of tha
beautiful actress.
"When next Blanche "Walsh comes to
California, which the ever active pres*.
agent says will be soon, she will present
a brand new play by H. J. W. Dam, tha
well-known California author. It Is
called "Madeleine." The story of tha
piece is laid In Paris, and the title part
is a powerful character drawn on broad
lines, which permit Miss Walsh to run
through a whirlwind of passions In every
scene. Also to wear some costumes that
are described as dreams.
The strenuousness of modern Ufa has
found another Intensely exciting thrill In
"Molly Pitcher," the Revolutionary play
in which Kathryn Kidder Is starring this
season. In this the heroine loads and
fires a cannon In the battle of Monmouth,
and Miss Kidder executes this scene with
a vim that is good, for half a dozen cur
tain calls. It Is a play is which. tha
player rises transcendent.
Viola Allen has just expressed a sen
timent that will be sure to create a sen
sation among the actor folk. "It may
seem ungracious and ungrateful to say
so," she says, "but to me the encora la

for a discourtesy to the public for wt
all love to have our work appreciated,

But the acknowledgment of a call Invar

' .You' who are going â¢ to be married this

there could be no marriage ! But; though
the sorrow, and indignation of ' the : people
were great, ' they could say ' no word. The
Emperor's word was law, and ,to â¢ dispute
it would have' been like "putting one's body
In! the arena or offering up one's tongue
for the tearing out. ....;,
Just how Valentine came to be regarded
as the Saint of Love is not accurately
known. ' People who have fallen in love
are notoriously forgetful; and those who
profited by. his benefactions forget to
leave - a strict account of the circum
stances leading up to the case. One of
the talesâ a very well authenticated one-
Is this: One day in a fit of jealous passion
the Emperor, whose ; latest lady love had
fled from him, gave forth a royal decree
that for one whole year there should be
no -. marriages in Rome. / Tjhe } royal . edict
was proclaimed throughout the city and
told from the temples. .- : :
A Cruel Decree.
In the midst, of this unhappy state, of
affairs, for Claudius was an unusually bad
man; Priest Valentine walked serene.
The people from city's gate to city's gate
knew him; and none knew him but to love
him. 'His purity. and his unselfishness
made him a saint on earth-. and his con
tinued loveliness maintained him in that
holy spot. â¢ :
with. ministrations. His advice was good
and so, seeing the happy culmination of
love, others sought "him, and so his pop
ularity grew. Finally, in' Jealousy t tho
Emperor beheaded him.
He Died for Love.
"Out of all the legends of those days this
fact stands clear:^ Valentine was the
friend of those m love, and he died for
"them. Claudius In Jealousy caused~hlm
.to be put out of the way. Ha perished
for love without love's sweets.
Â¦ To this day a little touch of sadness
"clings around St. Valentine's day. There
is sentiment and In sentiment there must
be a trace of sorrow or^ it Is not senti
ment! The .bitter and ' the sweet, the
sweet predominating, make up agreeable
sentiment," the kind the .devotee of St.
'Valentine loves to hug to his heart.
'-Â¦Â¦'Â¦ While the actual day of St. Valentine
has, passed away there is no doubt that
:the actual meaning is. still here. The
token of the : hearts, on the

postponement meant still more) for, then,
as now, man's love was of ' man's life a
thing apart, but 'twas woman's whole ex
istence. St. Valentine saw them grieving
and grieved with them. \ ;
Valentine was a priest. He officiated In
the temple and he had a great following.
In those days the Emperors were not al
ways good men. The. halo of the throne
was no guide to better ways and the man
who sat in the high places peered Into
the darkness of the baser. world and se
lected from it his enjoyments. .â¢ His ar

hearts. \_ ' , , - â¢'-// .
The man who so Imprinted himself upon
the affectionate and eternal remembrance
of the world died over two" thousand years

Claudius and was one of the principal
personages of ancient Rome, or Rome In
those days when 'â¢ it was ; between great
age and medium modernity.
A saint; who can so Impress himself upon
the whole world as St. Valentine has done
must have been a remarkable personage.
To-day there is probably no one in the
wide earth who has not heard of St.
Valentine unless that person be deaf and
stupid and not of the world. The name
lives and travels on and becomes known
to each generation of childhood almost as
early as Santa Claus; the baby of four

of ninety has not forgotten. , â¢

shops there are tokens that are undeni

clasped over that ever important member,

hands and hearts. â¢ ,
But in the large shops there repose great
silken pillows with a word about Valen
tine, lettered below a picture of Cupids;
and at the confectioners' there are . big
and sundry cakes denoting the coming
day. The silken tokens and the cakes,
with their expensive accouterments, still
carry with them a suggestiveness of
In these latter days St. Valentine is
viewed a little more flippantly. He is the
god of an evening's fun; the excuse for
a cotillon, with Cupid for favors; or the
saint who provides a theme for little gay
colored bits of paper that are passed
around from child to child without more
than a bit of child's play for meaning.
The crop of engagements directly fol
lowing St. Valentine's day was enormous,
and many Easter weddings were the di
rect result. In other cases the engage
ment found culmination a year from Eas
ter, and for fifteen months, according to
old Dutch custom, the two devoted them
selves to proving that they were worthy
of each other. -'"'- \
It is not so very many years since the
ardent swain waited for and depended
upon St. Valentine's day to help him
through the ordeal which he had In mind,
and through which he knew he must pass

FRIDAY, the day of ill omen, takes
en, this year, a cheerful aspect.
High in the courts of the , unseen
world sits Cupid, the God of Lcve.
It is the day of St. Valentine, his
memory day, when tokens are sent in
honor of the dead saint.
For twenty-four hours the God of Love
holds court and the ardent swain 'may
declare himself In words true and plain
unto the lady of his 1902 choice.
CLAUDIUS' PERSECUTIONS THAT MADE VALENTINE THE SAINT OF LOVE
remarks concernln' me, I'll wind up "by
commentin* on. his conduct with a bowie.'
" 'As I Intimates, Old Houston is that
pride-blown that you-all couldn't stay in
the same ten-acre lot where he is. An'
he's worried to a standstill fof a openin'
to onload on the Texas public a speciment
of his dignity. At last, seein' the chances
comln' some slow, he nacherally ups'an'
constructs the' opportunity himse'f.
" 'Old Houston's home camp that a"way
is at a hamlet named Washin'ton, down
on the Brazos. It's thar he squanders the
heft of his leesure when not back of the
game as President over to Austin. Thar's
a clause in. the constitootion which,
while pitchin'- onto Austin as the pub
lic's home-ranche or capitol, permits the
President In event of perils onforseen, or
invasions or sech, to round up the arch
ives an' move the capitol camp a whole
lot. Old Houston, eager- to be great,
seizes onto this yere tenet as presentin'
the chance. . *
" 'I'll jest sort o' order the capitol to
come down; yere where I live at, on the
Brazos,' says Old Houston, 'an' tharby call
the waverin' attention of the Lone Star
publlc to who I be.' .
"'As a 'argyment leadin' up to this
atrocity Old Houston allows- that .Austin
is menaced by Comanches. Shore, it ain't
menaced none: Austin would esteem the
cleanin'out of that entire Comanche tribe
as the labors of a holiday. But it -fills
into Old .Houston's hand to Â¦, make thid
bluff as a excuse. An' with that he issues
the order to bring the whole gov'ment
lay-out from box to check-rack down to
Washln'ton on the Bra'zos. .
" 'No, as I tells you 'all before,' Austin
ain't in no more perils from Comanches
than she is from grizzly b'ars. Troo,
these yere rannikaboo savages does show
up in paint an' feathers over across th3
Colorado once or twice \\ but beyond a
whoop- or two an' a little ; permiscus
shootin* Into town, which nobody minds,
them vis'tations don't come. To give you
all gents a idee how little important these
Comanches is to my, Texas forefathers,
I hears my old gent tell of Bill Spence,
who keeps a store in Austin. Bill's addin'
up Virge Home's accounts at . the time in
his books. 'One pa'r of yaller top, copper
toe bbots for Vlrge, joonior, three dol-

Morton, who's a knife fighter an* has
sliced divers foes from time to time; 'an*

" 'An' for these yere followin' reasons to
Â¦wit. explains Old Houston when some
Austin sports puts it to him p'lite, but
steadfast, that he's onjust to Jedge Webb.
'I permits Colonel Morton to talk some,
because it don't make a splinter of dif
ference what Colonel Morton says. He
can talk on any side of any subject an*
no one's ediot enough to pay the least
attention to them remarks. But this slt
yooation is changed *when you-all gets to
Judge Webb. He's a disaster. Jedgs
Webb never opens his mouth with sub
tractln' from the sum tdlal of hooman
knowledge.' I divulges no secrets when
I says that these explanations of Old
Houston's is distasteful to Colonel Mor
ton an' Jedge Webb.
"Colonel Morton an* Jedge Webb them
se'fs wades through that carnage from
soda to hock freeln* Texas, an' they sort
o' flggers that these yere services entitles
them to be heard some. Old Houston,
who's born -with a notion that he's doo
to make what public uproar any o'caslon
demands, don't encourage these two pa
triots. He only listens now an' then to
Colonel Morton; an" as for Jed^re Webb,
he jest won't let that Jurist talk at alL
" 'Old Houston himse'f on the hocks of
them vic'tries he participates In, an' bein'
selected president like I says, grows as
full of vanity as a prairie dog. Shore!
he's a hero; the drawback is that his no
tion of demeanin' himse'f as sech Is to
spread his tall feathers an' strut. Old
Sam gets that puffed up, an* his dignity
Is that egreeglous, he feels crowded If a
gent tries to walk on the same street with
him.
" 'About the first dash outen the box
old Houston gets himse'f into trouble with
two Lone Star leadin' citizens whose
names, respectif. Is Colonel Morton and
Jedge Webb.
" 'When we-all Texans settles down to
conduct and kyarve out the destinies of
that empire which we conquers from San
ta Anna an' the Mexicans we pitches on
Austin as the capital an' old Sam Hous

yere, old Houston, by all roomer an' tra

next Which he's "as full of surprises as
a day an* a night in Red Dog.

game where Jack shoves back, 'it brings
up a story my old gent Is wont to tell of

" 'I'm camped in Coyote Canyon,' says
Jack, 'on the western aige of Deaf Smith,

Also, as it first perforates that gold re

in the nobility of nerve, thar's nona to

Deaf Smith.

" The sun 13 restln* on the sky-line over

Colonel Morton to the black Interloper, at

"Tha black stranger makes no reply;

Colonel Morton an' the black stranger. '
Jedge Webb Is more for peace, an* don't .
believe In beglnnln* all negotiations with,

notion of a j'Int debate. Jedge Webb dic
tates a passel of p'lite queries to this yers
black stranger. Tharupon, the- black
stranger bows p'lite an' formal a whole
lot, an* goln' over to the table writes
down in good 'English, 'I'm deef an'
dumb.' Next, he searches outen' his war
bags a letter. It's from Old Houston over
on the Brazos. Old Houston allows that
onless Austin comes trailln' into hla pres
ence with them records within three days,
he'll ride over a whole lot an' round 'em
up himse'f. Old Houston declar's that
Austin, by virtue of them Comanches, la
as onsaf e as a poker game on the Missis

sech dangers while performln* his sacred
dootles as President of the Texas Com

There are four in this series, and each"
one is very 'delicately done in color and
with rhymes to give the proper valentine
spirit. Price 40 cents each. The "Jackass
"Valentine" has an appropriate verse un

tothe valentine and is sure to' make a hit,
with the recipientâ whether for better or

Only the outline of the story has been
given. Although the novel is of not more
than average length, the number of im
portant characters introduced and the di
versity cf interests involved is so great
that to be appreciated it must be read in
Its entirety. There are several love stories
The plans which Mrs. Hunter has made
for her brother do not turn out as suc
cessfully as do those which she has made
for herself. Craig proves worse than use
less to the firm for which he works. A
piece of rascality which he perpetrates
makes It necessary for him to leave Phila
delphia. Then, too. In epite of his sister's
efforts In his behalf, Craig fails to win the
love and fortune of Katherine Morrow.
AX this time Mrs. Hunter finds It no long
er expedient for her to remain in Phila
delphia, A friend of the Fairthornes ap
pears there and discovers in Mrs. Hunter
the wife from whom he had been divorced
8omo years before, after she had done
what she could to ruin his life. To save
thÂ« Fairthornes from further Injury he
tells the soi-disant Mrs. Hunter that un
less she takes herself out of the way he
will expose the fclstory of hen|T>ast with
ail its dishonorable episodes. Mrs Hun
ter prepares to leave the Fairthorne
house. On the eve of her departure Mr
Fairthorne dies. His death secures for
Mrs. Hunter the money which she has
schemed so skillfully to obtain. Kather
ine Morrow, now her own mistress, for
sakes her family and goes with Mrs, Hun
ter to Europe".
Socn after the return cf Katherine to
Philadelphia Mrs. Hunter makes her ap
pearance there, accompanied by her
brother, Lionel Craig. Craig is the one
perron in the world for whom his sister
entertains 'a pure, disinterested affection.
He is a lazy, weak, worthless fellow, but
his sister's eyes are blind to his defects.
Her hopes are centered in him. Conceal
ing' from him, as far as she can, her own
defects, she tries to spur him on to reach
a. standard of moral excellence which she
herself has no desire to attain. When
the brother and sister become settled in
Philadelphia Mrs. Hunter, by means of
her Influence over Katherine Morrow, ob
tains for Craig a position In a banking
house. It is Mrs. Hunter's ambition in
bringing her brother to Philadelphia to
have him succeed in fixing upon himself
the vacillating affections of Katherine
Morrow. In Philadelphia Mrs. Hunter
renews her attentions to Miss Morrow and
soon has her completely under control.
Then Mrs. Hunter proceeds to make Mr.
Fairthorne the object of her solicitous
care. Little by little ehe wins the old man
from the influence of those of his rela
tives and friends who are clever enough
to sec that Mrs. Hunter Is an unprincipled
woman. She induces Mr. Fairthorne to
employ her as his secretary and to intrust
to her the management of his affairs. It
is not long before she goes to live In the
Fairthorne home, to the sorrow and an
noyance of Mary Fairthorne, who Is pow
erless to conteract the evil influence which
Mrs. Hunter exerts over her uncle and
cousin. Finally Mrs. Hunter succeeds in
persuading Mr. Fairthorne to add to his
will a codicil In which' a large sum of
money is bequeathed to her on the pro
viso that she shall be with him when he
dies. Fortunately, Mr. Fairthorne can
not be inveigled into marrying his secre
tary, as his friends fear he will do_
Mr. Fairthorne is the guardian of
Katherine and of another niece, Mary
Fairthorne, an orphan., Mary Fairthorne
is also a member of the household of her
uncle, who is a widower. Mary is littl*
older than her cousin, yet there is
already developed in her .a steadiness of
purpose and a nobility of character no
traces of which are found in the Insincere
and frivolous Katherine. , Mr. Fairthorne
is an enthusiastic collector of autographs
and rare books. At the time the story
opens he is an old man, querulous and
exacting.
THE part played by an adventuress
In promoting the happiness or un
happiness of certain people Is the
theme of "Circumstance," a new
novel by S. Wier Mitchell. The
scene of the story Is laid in Philadelphi ..
The main characters are. for the most
part, inhabitants of that place. The con
ventional and quiet life of these people
Is Interrupted by the appearance of a
stranger, whose clever and unscrupulous
machinations make her for a time a
potent factor for evil in their lives. Thl.Â»
woman, who Is known as Lucretia
Hunter, makes her first appearance in
the story while on her way from Newport
to New York. Who Mrs. Hunter really is
becomes known in the course of this his
tory of a part of her career. At Newport,
where Mrs. Hunter has been staying, she
has made the acquaintance of a young
girl. Katherine Morrow. The latter is an
orphan, who lives in Philadelphia with
her uncle, a wealthy man named John
Fairthorne. Miss Morrow is a pretty girl,
but Is vain, frivolous and devoid of depth
of character and keenness of intellect. As
her affection promises to be a source* of
advantage, Mrs. Hunter tries to gain it
by the exercise cf all the wiles at 'her
command. The youqgr girl lends a ready
ear to the flattery which is offered her.
and is socn made to believe that in Mrs.
Hunter she has met the only person who
has ever appreciated the beauty of her
character at its true worth. Before Mrs.
Hunter leaves the steamer at New York
6he seeks out Miss Morrow, who is on
board, and exacts from her a promise not
to let their acquaintance drop. Mrs.
Hunter remains for a short time in New
York, while Katherine Morrow returns to

a-j mild as you please. Kick Carter has
ceased to hound and to rescue and to day.
Eugene T. Sawyer, Journalist, is all that
he styles himself nowadays. Geno Saw
yer t's friends call him. But to the world
a.t large, the big reading world that
knows him but does not know him, he
Â¦will always be Nick Carter, king of dime
novelists.
"Yes." said Mr. Sawyer, with a sup
pressed chuckle, "they tell me that my
name is a household word among the
stable boys and house maids of New
York. But I did not write all the trash
wfcicn is now being printed over that
name. There are others."
So not all the Nick Carter novels which
you will find for sale at the news agent's
stall or concealed under the pillow* of
your beys or in their inside pockets were
Â¦written by Gene Sawyer. And more's the
j>ity. because none of his stories offend
morality. While they do not point a
moral they do not degTade cither. They
are always absurd, but never vulgar.
The people, the many, "are the ones who
love his stories. To a man whose life is
measured by yards of muslin and tap*
or bounded by the four walls of a. dingy
olTsce. the headlong rush of them, the ab
solute abandon, the defiance of every
thing tuat binds is a revelation and a
delimit.
The majority of people on this great.
Staff* of human life are "supers." Most"
oÂ£ them never have a line to recite except
"Hurray!" in a mob. They are never
a necessary part of an event. Nothing
ever happens to them. Their pulses never
beat fatter because of an actual experi
once, and to them book thrills are the
only thrills to be had. They get thoir
tcenta! stimulus from detective novels.
The 1: trees that strut between yeilow
covers are the only ones they can ever
"hobnob with. No wonder these people
love Nick Carter.
Mr. Sawyer is one of the simplest of
men. It strikes one as incongruous to
think of this mild, dignified, sincere gen
tleman with the grave gray eyes as Cue
author of "A Dead Han's Hand" or "Xict
Carter's Fight for Life."

It is said that when he was in the yel
low novel business hh method of work
was unique. An old friend who knew
Gene when he was writing his great in
ventions tells the - following story of the
way he thought them out.
"H6 never made up the whole plot be
fore he began to write, he did not even
make a chapter outline. He Just began
with his characters, and after he had got
ll.e herd into what seemed an Inextricable,
position In a cave; for instance, bound
gagged, or on the edge of a bottomless
pit with his enemies advancing to destroy
him. Gene would stop, take a long breath,
walk the floor for a few minutes, then
sit down and pull him out again."

happen in his stories. Damsels go about
with daggers in their bosoms and the

got $50,000â the record price ever paid for
a -bare and unpatented idea. It was a

to do it, and it made Harvey Browne the
father of all soda water and other artl
flclar "fizzes" in" the world to-day.
idea having been born, Browne took it to
a big beer bottling firm and offered it for
sale. They questioned him closely and
easily could have appropriated his idea
without paying him a cent, but they hap
pened to be honest persons, and seeing at
once that : the scheme would work they
offered the man with the happy thought
$25,000 for his idea, jfj But Browne asked
$50,000, and threatened to\go away and
patent the idea and sell , it to - some one
else If his terms were not complied with.
The upshot of the matter was "that
Browne signed an agreement and left the
office; of the firm with a check for $50,000.
: For; easy money it would . be hard' to

man ; Miles received for,; his Idea of per
forating'postage stamp sheets from the
British postal : authorities. , Before that
the stamps were printed in sheets which
had â¢ to be cut with . a", pair of scissors.
One day when â¢ Miles waa - thinking about
nothing in particular it occurred to him
that perforations between the stamps
would enable them to be separated with
out the bother of using scissors. He did
not stop to patent his idea, but rushed off
to the proper postoffice officials Â¦ and ex
plained his idea. Illustrating it with a pin
and ; a sheet of writing paper. He' also
suggested a simple device for a perforat
ing machine. It did not take a genius t*
appreciate the value of the idea, and even
the Government officialsâ British ones at
thatâ saw .It. Miles asked $25,000 for his
idea, and though he held no patent he got
what he demanded after some delay.
Twice in his life the late John Ruthin
sold tare ideas, Just as they had corns into

sums for both of them. . One was an idea
for a safety valve which is. now used ex

taken out a patent the royalties on his In
vention : would have netted him much
more money, but he preferred to sell hia
idea' as soon as it was born, and he got
$15,000, for it.:. Five -years later he sold,
just as it stood in his head, an Idea for a.
sausage-making machine for $5000.
Huntley ,Webb when he conceived the
idea of his "facile" electric motor rushed
right off and offered it for sale. He con

being forestalled that prevented his wait

sold It. He died last year worth a com
fortable fortune. -
and vastly more Interesting than any ha
ever portrayed In his books. He began
his literary career by writing for the
New York Mercury.*" He was a graduate
of Annapolis and served for a time In tho
United States navy. During that time he
challenged and fought thirteen duels with
his brother officers and escaped without a
scratch.
"When the Rebellion broke out he en
listed and went to the front as colonel of
a New York, regiment of volunteers. He
was cashiered for drunkenness and re
turned home. Then he reformed and
turned- temperance lecturer. He traveled
all over the country lecturing â¢and camo
to the coast in that capacity.
"When he left San Francisco to go East
he stopped off at Laramle and there he met
Buffalo B11L . Buntllne became greatly at
tached to Bill and stayed in Larajnle with
him several months. He wrote a descrip
tion of him which appeared in a leading
New York paper with a big pic
ture of BUI In the center of the
page. Next he wrote a series of
stories In which Buffalo j Bill was the
hero. Shortly afterward he wrote a play
and Bill had a leading part. He got Texas
Joe and Wild Bill to join the company and
all went merrily for a time.. But after a
few performances' Buntllne got drunk
again and the partnership was dissolved.
Buffalo Bill went on tha boards on his
own hook and eventually got tip his Wild
West show.
"Poor old Buntllne reformed and died.
For the sake of my stories I am mighty
glad he lived and was bad first. He not,
only inspired me, to write, but he fur
nished me a character that I used many
a time."
Mr. Sawyer himself has had many and
varied Ufa â¢ experiences. In 1874 he and
Edwin Markham started to publish a
daily paper in San Jose called "The Gar
den City Times." When everything was
ready to begin, the "angel" of the enter
prise Insisted upon making it a prohibi
tion paper, and said that if his wishe3
were not complied with he would with
draw his support. The two enterprising
young men would not agree to that, and
as the, plans were all laid they decided to
try it alone. Mr. Sawyer was managing
editor and Mr. Markham was literary
editor. They hoped to make It the best
paper on the coast. But it" ran just eleven
days. Then the printers and the rest' of
the force got anxious for their pay, so the
partners settled up and killed the paper.
t iWhen all the bills were paid they had
just six dollars and seventy cents left and
they went into St. James square and di
vided it between them."
Mr. Sawyer has also written plays. He
wrote "Loyal Hearts," a military drama,
in which Eleanor Calhoun and Adele
Waters made their debut on the dramatic
stage. Besides, he wrote a "Log Cabin"
series and serials by the wagon load.
He no longer writes dime novels. He
has reformed most violently and has set
tled down to conservative journalism in
the mildest kind of way. The imperious
lady of the dagger, the black-masked vil
lain, the avenging heroâ they are his pup
pets, 1 and he has stored them away, never
to be taken down again.* He says that he
is through with them. Ha can afford to
let them go now that they have made
money for him.
"It was all pot-boiling," he says. "What
I wrote was not literature, it was rub
bish, but it was what the people wanted."

From the number of coroneted heads
that grace the opera some nights one
might almost imagine that the entire roy
al family of England, not omitting cous
ins and aunts several times removed, but,
nevertheless, privileged to adorn them
ccives with this Insignia of rank, had
stepped over and taken possession of the
parterre and grand tier. Yet were all the
crowned heads of Europe, arrayed In
their imp.erial Jewels, gathered together
In' the Metropolitan, it Is safe to say
they would scarcely succeed In surpass
ing the magnificent display of the fash
ionable set.
Head Jewels Imperative. *
If "uneasy lies the head that wears a
crown," torturing, indeed, must be the
slumbers of her who cannot deck her
coiffure with Jewels of tome kind. A tiny
bandeau or an insignificant tiara admits
her to the elect. Her ornament may not
epread over quite eo great an area as
the conspicuous crown adorning the tran
qsil head of her neighbor, but^ there is
pome balm In Gilead If her -gems are
larger and consequently more worthy
careful notice. Nowhere except In this

well it fits her. too. All the tire
some ceremony attendant upon the
coronation cf a monarch is spared this
dainty bit of independent femininity.
She likes to wear a coronet, at least on
occasions, and so she places one above
her brow and carries it with all the regal
grace of a Josephine. Even the most crit
ical would never guess that she had not
been reared from* infancy with an assort
ment of crowns at her command, so thor
oughly to the manner born is she.
Still, it matters not to her whether her
head ornament is patterned after a duch
ess' coronet or built upon the lines of an
imperial crown. The effect is what she
is after, and a tiara. If It flash with gems
large and brilliant enough to disturb the
repose of an envious neighbor, answers
quite as well as a crown.

15But Miss Lillian's spirit of Tanks*
thrift rose up to haunt her as money
drained out and none Cowed in. So Maret
Â«k took her to Gilmore, with the admo
nition to sing "something easy" from
"Lucia." With thi3 admonition in her
ears the girl burst forth in the "Bright
Seraphim" aria from "Samson."
Gllmore engaged her for a hundred con
certs in Europe. Before leaving this coun
try she paid a visit to John O'Nell, her old
teacher, to receive this encouragement:
"It is really too bad. Miss Lillie, after all
your devotion to pure art, this going to
Europe with a brass baflfd."
But Miss Lillle had an eye to business.
She went with Gllmore, taking her mother
with her; and out of the brass band tour
enough money was saved, with a little
more borrowed, for more lessons.
This time It was in Milan, under San
Giovanni. The musty garret In Milan wms
made cheerful and homelike by a few
feminine trick3 of the devoted mother,
who also substituted wholesome New
England cookery for spaghetti and maca
roni.
There was nothing in Lillian Norton's
method of singing to undo and San Gio
vanni declared her ready for the stage.
Every day mother and daughter went to
him for rehearsal, and In December, 1378,
Lillian made her debut in "La Traviata,"
at Brescia, before an audience of Italian
peasants who knew singing If they did not
know how to be fashionable. Her success
was immediate and absolute. She almost
fainted on the stage when the people rose
to their feet and cheered. The faithful
mother fainted behind the scenes.
Then there was a more sophisticated. If
not a more critical, audience to conquer
at Genoa, and Lillian Norton was firmly
launched upon the operatic sea. It be
came a custom among San Giovanni's pu
pils in Milan to repeat the master's say-
Ing regarding his favorite American pu
pil, "Ah, la Nordica! She has poetry. She
has fire." It was San Giovanni who chrls-.
tened her Glglio Nordica, the lily of the
north.
Nordica's first operatic engagement was
for three months in St. Petersburg. In
the Russian capital the lovely young
singer waa often sent for by the Czar to
sing at the palace.
Such yards of red tape to unwind out
side" the door of the royal apartments!
Such freedom and good fellowship within!
And thenâ one week from the last Sunday
night on which Nordica sang for the Czar,
came the news of his assassination.
During the dark days that followed no
one was allowed to leave the capital; but
a3 soon as police surveillance would admit
of their departure, Lillian and her mother
went again to sunny Italy, where the
young operatic singer studied new roles*
with San Giovanni.
Mr. Norton died during the first year his
wife and daughter were abroad and from
that time Nordica had her mother as a
constant companion up to the time of her
death In 1S32. Just how much the great
singer owes to this mother Is beyond esti
mate, but her devotion was repaid in
kind. The mother's unselfishness and
force of will are well shown by the fact
that the cablegram announcing her hus
band's death was handed to her as shÂ«
stood in the wings of the Imperial Opera
house in St. Petersburg, while her daugh
ter was singing on the stage. When Nor
dlca came off the scene at the end of
the act the mother had her feelings under
such control that Lillian suspected noth
ing, and not until the following morning
was she told of her father's death.
And was this "Lily of the North" to
live solely for her art? So It seemed.
There were no walks or drives with men,
nor theaters, nor balls, such as delight th*
hearts of American girja.
' If a man chose to call, hÂ» might en con
dition that he stayed not later than 19
o'clock, and the daughter was ever under
the watchful chaperonago of her mother.
There were lovers in plenty, says Mrs.
Castillo, but though they might woo they
might not win, until one day along came a
rich cousin of Mrs. Norton, Frederick
Gower. who wooed and won. After a
short acquaintance Lillian Norton mar
ried her second cousin, in July, 13S5, at
Paris.
Gower*s career was somewhat unique.
The son of a poor widow, ho educated
himself *and became city editor of the
Providence Journal. At one time he
wrote to Bell, the telephone man, asking
him. to deliver a lecture on his telephone
In Providence. Bell In reply asked Gower
to come to Boston and assist him in pre
paring the .lecture. Gower became deeply
interested in the invention, which he suc
ceeded In improving and simplifying, and
ultimately took out patents for the Gower-
Bell telephone. After establishing: a com
pany he went to France, where he took
out patents and formed a company which
paid hlan as president $25,000 a year.
It 'was about this time that he met the
Nortons and he had come to appear more
the Frenchman than the American. In
spite of the mother's care, however. In
the choice of a husband for Lillian, tho
marriage proved an unhappy one and
after eighteen months the wife returned
to Boston and had just instituted suit
for separate maintenance when the news
came of the disappearance of Gower.
Gower had worked out a theory that by
the use of magnetism in ' the control of
balloons they could be made of great ser
vice for military and commercial pur
poses. To test his theory Gower started
with a French friend to cross the Eng
lish Channel and that was the last of
them- The balloon was seen floating- far
out at sea by a passing ship, but Jxm how
Gower met his death has never been
known. His reputed wealth dwindled piti
fully when the estate came to be settled
and the widow received very little from
It. After several years ot retirement she.
returned to the stage to continue her tri
umphs.
That these have been dearly bought.
Nordica would have all the world know,
for she says:
"Nothing comes to me but through work
and perseverance. I work when I do not
want to. I shut my doors and dig Into the
bars. I dream of them!
"When a girl I acquired the habit of get-
Ins to work against all inclination. To
me, I will say frankly, all things coma
slowly and through toil. Ambition is a
fearful master and, tyrant, but I would not
exchange it for another."
Nordica's first tragic matrimonial ex
perience did not discourage her from em
barking a second time on that troublous
sea, About five years ago she married
,Â£oltan Dome, a young Hungarian tenor,
whom she met at Bayreuth. and to dat*
the. marriage Is reported a happy oa*.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
and when the Cubans went back to Bos
ton Imogen planned to go to visit some
cousins living- just outside the city, that
she might be near her fiance.
Here was the mother's chance. Of
course, she could not allow her daughter
to go alone so far from the home nest.
"Why not remove the nest?
So it came about that the farm was sold
and the family- moved to Boston, renting
a large enough house to take roomers and
boarders. The mother had converted the
father to the belief that the girls should
have a better education than the Maine
village offered. The father was also hop
ing for a competency from an Invention
he had Just perfected for coring apples.
But his hopes were to go the way of
many other bright hopes. He placed the
invention in the hands of a friend, giving
him power of attorney t to act, and while
the friend became rich from the Inven
tion the Inventor never got a penny out
of It.
At this time Lillian was six years' old,
a restless child, the pet of the family,
badly- spoiled and full of., whims. She
fretted under the restraint of schoorknd
paid little, heed to her books.'
â¢ "She never did take education like other
.' people," says Mrs. Castillo. "She seemed
to absorb it by observation; but unless
she was Interested it could not be drilled
into her." . %
She ran away to the theater whenever
â¢ she had a chance, and her greatest pleas
ure was in the companionship of her
father. The two were great cronies and
were always together at theater or con
cert, and 1 once they attended a reception
to President Johnson,' when the President
took the child upon his knee and talked
to her. for 'a long time.
â¢ Four of the girls had two large beds
In a\ roomy chamber. On the wall hung
a long mirror, before which the children
-paraded in their long trains, playing lady
come-to-sea. .
'.*Â¦Â¦ "Often," says this elder sister,"! have

and seen Llllle in her long nightdress, her
hair streaming down her back, pirouetting
or standing on .tiptoe before the. glass.
whistling some new air she had caught
at: theater or concert. At this time sha
I was nine or ten years old.
"Llllie had not been a particularly
'pretty child," she continued, "but be
tween twelve and thirteen she blossomed
out Into the prettiest girl I ever saw.
The pupils of her beautiful bright. eyes
.were so large that the eyes looked black
instead of blue at night; Her glossy nut.
brown hair hung far down her back. She
had fine teeth, a beautiful complexion and
a dazzling smile. While her features were
not regular there was a fascinating play
about them." . . <Â¦ - â¢
The opening of; Lillian's career came
about In a sad â¢wa.y. WJlhelmlna, three
years older, had been placed In the Con
servatory of Music soon after the family
moved to Boston. Her fine voice attracted
much attention and great things were
prophesied for this girl of seventeen.--' She
-'wentthome to sing at Farmington and the
I next morning the news spread , through
I the town that she was stricken; with
typhoid fever. Quick consumption fol
! lowed and In six weeks the girl was dead.
For months th* piano remained closed la
the Norton house. Then the family took
up. the course of their life again. -Â¦ ';Â¦
By thÂ© move to Boston the family purse
had not grown longer. But'one daughter
could have the advantages of the co^
servatory and Lillian, now fourteen, took
thfe vacant place.'
The capricious, restless child, bored with
books. and the routine of school, settled
down, to steady, hard work at a pace
which she keeps up to this day. She waa
far ahead of her class , In natural rlf ta
and ability to learn. She became tho
special pupil of John O'Nell and In three
years had finished a five years' course.
Nor was . eh e ". free from â¢ the envy I that
attends \ success. -But the envious were
quickly put to rout by the sweetness and
modesty of the. young singer. When she
left the conservatory she was the ac
knowledged queen of all the singers oa
the school's long- roll. : - ,^ ~ . ,
Mr. Castillo, her. sister's husband, has
some pride in the fact that he - bought
Lillian's graduation dress. To the simple
child this sown I of brocade in several
shades \ of blue, which cost - $75, was a
gorgeous creation. It Is doubtful If she
feels half so grand .to-day In gowns that
cost ten times as much or more. . .
She was soon doing duty in a church
choir, and'was even called to fill engage
ments'as soloist In Baltimore and St.
Louis: But. ambition had her tn Its tolls
and, these mild honors failed to satisfy.
Titjens. the great singer, came to Boa
ton and 'the girl obtained an interview
with her. \Wlth youth's audacity she sang
for Tltjeris Leonora's great aria, and Tit-
Jens discovered what Lillian herself may
have dared to hope but. hardly to believe/
She was to sing that night "II Trova
tore," and the great singer showed the
girl how to ret a better effect In some
passages, dismissing her with an order ad
mitting her to the dressing room during
the -evening's performance. Here Lillian
was Introduced Jp Madame Maretzek, and
the -result of the episode, was that some
how the Nortons scraped together enough
money to take Lillian .and her mother to

LILLIAN NORDICA c*ts fewer
queer capers than any of the other
great singers. She does not de
mand the public's sympathy be
cause a pet poodle is denied ac
commodations In the "best suite of the
best hotels.
She does not fly into tantrums at the
last minute and have to be coaxed ami
wheedled by distracted managers behind
the scenes.
She does nothing, in fact, that is weird
or wantonly peculiar.
Hers is a good, wholesome doctrine of
common sense and hard work. .
The nearest Nordica has come to doing
anything sensational is in the alleged
adoption of the coon song as an offset to
Wagner In her repertoire.
As a matter of fact, Mme. Nordica has
not adopted ragtime and the coon song.
All the stir has been caused by her sinsr
ing a simple little negro melody of "Poor,
dear Nevin," as she calls him, the words
written by Frank L. Stanton.
*â¢ 'Mighty Lak' a Rose.' " says Nordica, .
"belongs to the best class of latter-day
American compositions and is so distinct
from coon songs or ragtime as to make it
a, surprise that any one should identify It
with such popular music. It is a song to
which justice can only be done by a cul
tured musician and I am surprised that
It is so commonly believed that I am slng
ing songs adapted to vaudeville and the
street organ."
of which goes to Bhow that Mme.
Nordica is not hysterically fond of ad
vertising and this makes her a paradox.
Perhaps some explanation of her un
dlva-like tendencies may be found in the
fact that Nordica is a down East Yankee,
and in Tankeeland the spirit of practical
common-sense grows rank.
Mme. Nordica is one of r. family of six
daughters and the youngest. The eldest
sister, Mrs. Emilio Castillo, has for many
years made her home in Los Angeles, and
as the only other living sisters are now
traveling with Nordica, there will be quite
a family reunion when the singer reaches
Southern California.
From Mrs. Castillo have been secured
many little stories of their girlhood days,
when in the quiet village of Farmington.
Me., the Norton home was the rendez
vous for the musically inclined in all the
country round. Â¦
The Nortons came of good old Puritan
ftock; likewise the Aliens, Nordica's ma
ternal ancestors. George Allen, the
/ounder of the family in America, landed
In 1635 and his granddaughter married the
>on of Miles Standish. Rev. John Allen,
â¢Corsica's grandfather, was : one time
chaplain of the Maine Assembly. One of
his favorite stories was that when a boy
he thought Farmington the center of the
universe, because when lying on his back
gazing upward the sky seemed highest
just over Farmington. But with his
daughter it was different. Her mind was
i ever wandering beyond the confines of the
villageâ away to the i?reat cities which
offered advantages to her and to her chil
dren. She even dared to dream, though
she dared not tell it, of Europe.
Of her mother, Mrs. Castillo draws this
picture:
"I remember when I was a great girl
and mother had several children, she
looked no more than 25 years old. She
had beautiful chestnut hair, which fell in
a profusion of curls each side of her
sweet, animated face. She was full of
energy, enthusiasm and enjoymentâal
ways ready to go or entertain upon any
one's suggestion."
A woman of energy and strong will.
Mrs. Norton was also a woman of high
and romantic ideals. Nor was she
ashamed of them.
It was because of her admiration of
Shakespeare's. character that her eldest
child received the name of Cymbeline's
daughter, Imogen.
It was because of her Interest in "The'
Last Days of Pompeii" that a second girl
was called lone.
What else could be expected from one
whose own parents had' christened her
Amanda?
The third daughter, for some reason,
had to content herself with the unrp
xnantic name of Annie; but the fourth,
who appeared when all America was
ehouting for Louis Kossuth, the Hunga
rian patriot, became Wilhelmlna Kossuth.
Again, It was her fondness for the
poems of Bayard Taylor and a senti
mental admiration for the young wife
whom he mourned that made Mrs. Norton
rail the fifth daughter Lillian Bayard

=HpÂ£ HE fate of Eleanor Fuller,
whose mysterious disap
l pearance -January 11 has
\ baffled the efforts of the
\ best detectives of the city,
is no longer uncertain.
The body of the girl was found
in an upstairs back bedroom of
an unfurnished house at 2211
Sutter street yesterday after
noon. The foul murder disclosed
by the discovery of the body is
a mystery that promises to rival
that of the slaj-ing: of Minnie
Williams and Blanche Lamont.
The body was identified last
night both hy Mrs. Alice Maud
Fuller, mother of the murdered
girl, and by Hugh C. Grant, the
attorney who has been the
friend and adviser of the family.
They identify the clothing with
| out reservation, and any doubt
due to the state of the body is re
moved by the certainty that the
clothing found in the chamber of
death was the clothing worn by
Nora Fuller when she was last
seen except by the murderer.
The girl's body lay entirely
nude on a bed in the large cham
ber, which was unfurnished ex
cept for the bed and a chair. The
victim of the murderer's plot had
apparently been dead at least ten
days. Nothing remained in the
house to indicate the means used
to take the girl's life, and yet the
posture of the body and its con
dition and the disorder of the
j^room pointed unmistakably to
murder and not to suicide; Who
the brutish fiend was who did the
deed, how he accomplished' his
hellish purpose and what- his mo
tive are still but matters of con
jecture, and those who seek to
unravel the mystery are at once
confronted with the question of
the identity of the man Bennett,
to whom Nora Fuller went to ac
cept a position to care for a child.

Aside from the meager furni
ture in the bedroom where the
dead girl lay, the house was emp
ty. In the hall several letters were
found, having evidently r been
slipped under the door", by the
carrier after the murder was
done. They were merely circu
lars from furniture dealers, dry
goods houses and others, sent to
the address obtained from the
real estate agents. Some of them
were addressed to "C. B. Haw
kins" and some to "Mrs. G. B.
Hawking." On a mantel were
found several similar letters,
none of them giving 'a clew Â¦ to
the 'identity of the persons ad
dressed. With them were cards
of various business houses. Ap
parently they had been gathered
â¢up by the murdered girl- in the
belief that she was Roinsr to become the
mistress of a household to.be equipped
by the man who had enticed her from
home. A small leather purse, evidently
the girl's,' contained several blank cards
and .'one on which was written the ad
dress "Mr. M. A. Serebrenck. Cornabe,
Eckford & Co., Port Arthur."

LANDLORD PRIBER
WAS SUSPICIOUS
E. C. Priber, president, of the Napa and
Sonoma Wine Company, who lives at 29
Scott street, is the owner of the house at
2211 Sutter street, where the dead girl
was found. He was very much annoyed
at the news and was loth to discuss the
matter. He blames Umbsen & Co. for
the trouble and says they should have
investigated Hawkins' references more
closely before allowing him to take the
house. .. .. .
"I bought the house at 2211 Sutter street
six months ago/' he said. "Upto th*
first of last month It was occupied by Mr.
Lowenthal. the cloak man. My agents
informed me that a man named Hawkins
desired to take the house, and they found
that he was all right after looking up hli
references. He took, the house about tha
8tli-or 9th. I -was informed that he had
not moved in any furniture, and I becamo
a little bit dubious. I ascertained that ono
of Hawkins' references was Mr. Wieneka
of the Golden West Hotel. I tailed on
that gentleman and we examined the
register. All we could find was the name.
â¢C. W. Harkins.' I was then informed
that Mr. Harkins had stayed at the hotel
a'day and that they knew nothing of him.
"I reported the result of my investiga
tions to tTmbsen & Co.. and I suppose
they investigated on their own account.
At any rate, they sent a man out there
and he rang the bell, or did something
else like that, and not finding any ona
home came back and reported this fact
to his employers. I only had one key
to the house and this waa turned over
to the tenant when he paid hla first
month's rent. ' , â¢
V I never went near the house, I simply;
made my complaint to the agents."
Perhaps never, before; has Butter street,
in the neighborhood of the mystery, been
bo worked up with excitement. Hundreds
of people" flocked to the house and men
and women; tried to force their, way up
the stairs to see, what they, concluded was

standing the advanced stage of'decompo
sition, there was, strangely, an absence
of odor which would be . expected under
such circumstances. That 'death had
taken place many days ' prior to Â¦ the, dis
covery of the body there is no doubt," and
therefere the absence of. an odor is all
the more extraordinary.. :
Deputy Coroner. McCormick, Deputy
Coroner Murphy and Detective T. Dillon
arrived in auick succession, and an ex
amination of the body was made' by Mc-
Cormick. ' It was -perfectly nude,' with the
exception that a part of the< upper sheet
was wrapped around the right hand. The
face*was reposeful and ".there were no ex
ternal marks of violence, though . there
were two marks on the throat that might
have been the result- of either decompo-;
slon, which had fairly vrell advanced, ; or
violence, though the latter theory, has not
many supporters. \ , . ..

premises and, entering the room, found

gation, the- officer called up the Coroner
and notified the detectives. ' -

should take a position that would not be
too Irksome and yet ; bring In a small in
come. She answered an advertisement
that appeared in the morning papers Fri
day, January 10. The advertisement read;
WANTED â A younr white rlrl to- take
charge of a child and do light housekeeping.
Apply Box 1220. ' : ,
His sister had not been home and no
word had been received from her.> He
hurried to the Popular restaurant, only to
find' it closed, and fearing that something
had happened, he hastened to the address
on Geary street, only to find it a vacant
lot. He made^inquiries in the neighbor
hood and the next day reported the mat
ter to the police.
While the voice sounded cheerful there
was something that was nervous In the
tone. Parlano left home soon afterward
to attend a meeting of the board of re
lief at the Masonic Temple on Post street.
When he returned about 11 o'clock he
found his mother in an anxious state.
She replied that she would go to the
Bay City Market, get the things and re
turn-home at once. . .
In answer, to a question she said that
she was with Bennett at his residence,
this time saying 1500 Geary street. I She
further said that Bennett and his family
were nice people and would like her to be
gin work for them right away. Parlane
asked the girl to hold the line while he In
formed her mother upstairs. He returned
to the 'phone a few minutes later and told
Eleanor that her mother said to return
home at once and on her way to bring
provisions for Sunday, she having taken
money for that purpose.
The girl left home at 5 o'clock to be at
the appointed place at the time mentioned
in the note. An hour later she telephoned
to her brother, Lewis J. Parlane, telling
him that she was In the 1500 block on
Geary street. Lewis recognized her voice.
If this letter does .not reach you in time,
call at the Popular restaurant, 55 Geary
street, at 1 o'clock; call at 6 p. m. Ask the
restaurant for John Bennett.
JOHN BENNETT.
Eleanor in reply to her application re
ceived the following note:
FERIDA, Yucatan, Feb. 8.â A group of
Maya rebel Indians have surrendered to
Colonel Flores at Bacalar. They were in
great misery, hungry and wholly desti
tute.
It was apparent that they were driven
to surrender by hunger, and their attitude
showed that they anticipated dire pun
ishment, if not death, at the hands of the
Mexican soldiers. Their gratitude was
unbounded on finding that Colonel Flores
received them with every evidence of
commiseration and humanity, ordering
that their wants be immediately supplied.
Plats of ground will be given to the In
dians to demonstrate their Intention to
obey the laws. -

FKKECG, Feb. 8.â The Chinese Government
to-day dismissed all the European professors
from the Imperial University.
It was consequently supposed that he
had been drowned. Parlane's photograph
was shown to Fred W. Krone, manager
of the restaurant in which Nora met
"John Bennett." Krone eald he thought
the photograph' to be that of a man a lit
tle younger in appearance than Bennett,
but that the features were similar. Aa
the photograph was taken some time ago,
however, it may be it was that of Par
lane.
Mrs. Fuller believed that if the man
was still alive he might have abducted
the girl. He was engineer of the steamer
Tal Wo, plying along the China coast, and
disappeared one evening while on the up
per deck getting a breath of fresh air.
Another theory advanced as to the
probable cause of the girl's disappearance
is that she was abducted by her father.
Fuller is not the right name of the girl.
Mrs. Fuller's first husband was the father
of Eleanor, and his name was James Par
lane. He was reported drowned years ago
by a Coroner's juryâ murdered, Mrs. Ful
ler said, but as no one ever saw his body
the charge was abandoned.
Her mother could not account for her
disappearance and believed that, she was
detained in some lodging-house. Mrs.
Fuller thought that Emma Searlght was
the other girl seen In the restaurant, but
Miss Searight of 1415 Polk street stoutly
maintained that she had not seen the
girl since her. disappearance.
Mrs. Fuller did not believe Evans'
thory, as she sraid that her daughter was
fond of home and cared nothing for run
ning: about the streets. She qnce re
mained out late, but that was only when
her little brother was playing at the Tiv
oll during Christmas week. Mrs. Fuller
was sick at the time and per
mitted Eleanor to take him to and from
the theater. - Except in this instance she
remained at home. %~> *""
The name impressed him, he having
read the account of Miss Fuller's disap
pearance. He went with the handwriting
to Mrs. Fuller, but she could not identify
it, while a brother thought It closely re
sembled the girl's writing. This story
would tend to uphold the theory that be
cause the girl's best friend ran away a
short time before that she.too, was seized
with a desire to see the world and ran
away to join her friend.
Robert R. Evans, a waiter in the Chi
cago restaurant. 13 Sixth street, believes
he saw Eleanor Maude Fuller alive and
well on Tuesday, January 14. She, with
another girl, entered the cafe about 10
o'clock and ordered coffee and charlotte
russe. The girls commenced giggling and
the waiter Jokingly tossed them a pencil
telling them if they couldn't tell him the
joke to write it down. He went about his
business and later in cleaning up the table
noticed the name "Nora" written in a
large round hand.

Eleanor Maude Fuller, aged 15 years,
disappeared from the home of her mother,
Mrs. Alice Maude Fuller, 1747 Fulton
street, *on Saturday evening, January 11.
Mangrum & Otter sent a signed circular
offering their services to the Hawkinses.
All this goes to show that Mrs. Hawkins
was thoroughly imbued with the hope
that she was to have a residence of no
small importance.
One of the letters, bearing the postmark
and date January 21 was discovered lying
by the side of trfe solitary chair. It was
addressed to Mrs. C. B. Hawkins, Golden
West Hotel, and had been redirected to
2211 Sutter street. Another of the busi
ness communications was addressed to "C.
B. Hawkins Esq., Golden "West Hotel,"
and there was one addressed, "Mrs. E.
Armstrong, 2211 Sutter street," from the
firm of Livingston Bros.
That the deceased was known as Mrs.
Hawkins there Is not the slightest doubt,
for several letters were In the scantily
furnished, uncarpeted room,' sent evident

soliciting Mrs. Hawkins' patronage. In
fact all the letters were in the same tenor
and made it appear that the girl had con

full expectation that it was to be her

MANY CARDS AND
CIRCULARS FOUND
Mrs. Rose Cohen, who resides at 2203
Sutter street, said last night: "Whatever
occurred must have been done quietly, as
I have not heard a sound from next door.
I noticed that all the windows were kept
closed and the shades back and front
closely drawn."
"The man I saw," said Asher "was I
should judge about 5 feet 7 inches high."
A relative of Mr. Asher, an elderly man,
saw a pretty, vivacious girl go hurriedly
up the steps of the house about ten days
or two weeks ago, but was unable to give
a minute description of her.
At any rate the girl and man whose name
she bore, or assumed, were seen. H. Asher
of 2213 Sutter street saw Hawkins leaving
the house about two weeks ago. Asher,
being anxious to know if the house was
let, and. also to know who his neighbor
was to be, asked the man if he had set
tled In the residence. He replied that he
had and was going to put. furniture in the
house. Asher describes the man as being
bet-ween 35 and 40 years old.
No one seems to have heard so much us
a sound from the house. Neighbors on
the right and on the left are at a loss to
understand how the female could have
been around for days and, if alive, not to
have been seen by them.
Another phase of the mystery Is the en
tire absence of identification by the
neighbors of either Hawkins or the girl.

For bables.no matter how young or deli-
cate, the tablets will accomplish wonders In
increasing flesh, appetite and growth. Use
only the large sweet tablets in every box. Full-
sized boxes are sold by all druggists for 50c,
and no parent should neglect the use of this
safe remedy for all stomach and bowel trou-
bles if the child is ailing In any way regarding
its food or assimilation.
Notary Public in and for Erie Co., N. Y.
Gentlemen: Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets were
recommended to me for my two months' old
baby, which was sick and puny, and the
doctors said was suffering from indigestion. J
took the child to the hospital, but there found
no relief. A friend mentioned the Stuart Tab-
lets and I procured . a box from . my druggist
and used only the large sweet lozenges in the
box and was delighted to â¢ find they were just
the thing for my baby. I feel Justified in say-
ing that Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets saved n|y
child's ,life. MRS. W. T. DETHLOPE.

these tablets that she went before the notary

Little children who are pale, thin and have
no appetite, or do not grow or thrive, should
use the tablets after eating and will derive

Free trial packages of a most remark-

will write to the State Medical Institute.
They cured* bo many men who had battled
for years against the mental and physical
Buffering of lost manhood that the Insti-
tute ha* decided to distribute free trial
packages to all who write. It is a home
treatment, and all men who suffer from
any form of sexual weakness resulting
from youthful folly, premature loss of
strength and memory, weak back, varico-
cele or emaciation of parts can now cure
themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location, giving strength
and development just where it is needed.
It cures all the ills and troubles that come
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute, success in
all cases. A request to the State Medical
Institute, 328 Elektron building. Fort'

is a^remedy of the greatest value in all kidney, liver, bladder and other Inflamma-
tory conditions of the genito-urinary tract. I now take pleasure in prescribing
Swamp-Root in all such cases, with a feeling of assurance that my patients will
derive great benefit from its use. I shall continue to prescribe it in other cases In

Kilmer's Swamp-Root, with most beneficial effect and know of many cures by it3

treated without benefit. Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root effected a cure. I am a liberal
man and accept a spet Iflc wherever I find it. in an accepted school or out of it.
For desperate cases of kidney complaint under. treatment with unsatisfactory re-

has great curative properties. Truly Yours,

WASHINGTON, Feb. 8.â Continuing his
narrative before the Senate Committee on
the Philippines, Governor Taft to-day re
verted to his testimony of yesterday for
the purpose of introducing a cablegram
he had received from - Acting Governor
Wright, urging a reduction ln the tariff
on Philippine articles imported into the
United States from the Philippines. He
said this cablegram was in response to
an inquiry from himself as to the effect
of a reduction of 50 per cent. The reply
of Acting Governor Wright is as follows:
Acting Governor of Phil
ippines Cables on
Conditions.
Senator Proctor asked where the friars
had secured money with which to pur
chase their lands, and this I inquiry led
Governor Taft to say that the fees for
marriages, funerals, christenings, etc.,
had been so high as to be complained of.
These charges for marriages had, he said,
led many 'couples to live together illicitly,
but that in most cases the obligations
thus taken were observed. .
general opinion 'as to the wealth and
holdings pf thevfriars had been greatly
exaggerated/He did not believe, -for In
stance, that they had- three-fourths of the
property owned in the cities. That; how
ever, the religious orders have ready cash
was true, as was evidenced by the fact
that they make loans. He instanced a
case in which the friars had advanced
money to promote a corner in hemp,
which had afterward failed because of ir
regularities on the part of the manager.
Governor Taft said the Philippine Gov
ernment is desirous of purchasing the
Manila property held by the friars, and
that it also would be desirable to secure
their holdings of agricultural lands.
In connection with the loaning of money
by the friars, Senator Lodge asked about
the necessity for a banking law, and the
witness replied that such- a law Is badly
needed. There are now, he said, two
Knglish banks in addition to the Spanish-
Filipino Bank, the latter being controlled
largely .by the church and being the only
bank of issue. He said there had been
some grants of land to the . church or
ders, but that as a rule they had ac
quired their holdings by purchase. .
The charge has been made," he said,
that much of their land had come to
them by deathbed conveyances, but this
charge is not borne out by a tracing of
the titles. The truth is that the friars
have the best titles in the island, and
even where there have been Irregularities
the statute of limitations would protect
the title." '

1 The Admiral was questioned concerning
the French lottery for the promotion of
Interest In the Panama canal, but he re
plied that he knew nothing about it ex
cept what he had heard in Paris. He had
understood there that such a lottery had
been authorized, but he knew nothing of
the limitations placed upon it or the
scope allowed it by the French law.
In reply to a question from. Senator
Morgan as to whether the Government of
the United States had instituted any ne
gotiations with the Government of Colom
bia relating to the transfer* of the prop
erty, Admiral Walker said that he would
have to -refer, the Senator to the State De
partmentâthat if he had such informa
tion he would not be at liberty to divulge
it. > He expressed the opinion, however,
that the Colombian Â¦ Government would
be. bound by any obligation assumed by
the Panama Company; because that Gov
ernment,is a stockholder in the Panama
Company. â¢.Â¦*Â¦.â¢-;, 1
â¢ He said he had had'no negotiations with
M. Lapre, secretary-general of the new
Panama Company, beyond receiving the
proposition for the'sale of that company
from him, as had'been published: -He
had, however, made many-inquiries of M.
Lapre concerning his company's title, and
had been assured by: that gentleman that
it was good. . â¢ * '-" ..: . =
"We only recommend the Panama route
as practicable and feasible," he said, "by
which we mean that' we considered the
engineering proposition as practicable
and â¢ the diplomatic negotiation as feasi
ble." Â¦ . --. - â¢. â¢ - Â»Â¦ â¢
Practicable and Feasible.
Senator Morgan questioned the witness
at length with reference to the commis
sion's Investigation of the power of the
new Panama Canal Company to transfer
the property and give clear title. In re
ply to all the questions on this line Ad
miral Walker said he had been satisfied
ln a- general way. that the new Panama
Canal Company would be capable of pass,
ing the property to the United States with
acceptable title, but thaf he was not a
lawyer, and that he felt satisfied In case
the recommendation of the commission to
accept the Panama route should be fa
vorably acted upon by Congress the Pres
ident would be assured by competent legal
advice of the genuineness of the title be
fore accepting the transfer. â¢
He stated, In reply to questions by other
Senators, that one of the curves in the
Panama. waterway would be quite sharp,
but he was of opinion that steam vessels
would be able to round it. He also said
that the harbor at Panama could be main
tained at a nominal cost.
The questions bringing out these points
were asked largely by Senator Hanna,
who also made inquiries concerning the
water supply for the Panama canal and
the difficulties ln the way of constructing
a dam at Bohlo. With reference to the
dam Admiral Walker said he had no
doubt that the engineering difficulties
could be overcome, and he also expressed
the opinion that the water supply would
be ample.
Hanna Shows Great Interest.
The examination to-day, was â¢with refer
ence to the reasons â¢why" the canal com
mission changed its' recommendations
from the Nicaragua to the Panama route.
The reasons given by the witness for this
change, summed up, are that the Panama
route Is much shorter and > has fe-wer
curves, and that those curves which do
exist are .not bo sharp as the curves in
the Nicaragua route. He also said he be
lieved that with proper quarantine regu
lations the health conditions of the region
along the Panama line could be much im
proved. He did not consider the present
condition from a health point of view as
bad. â¢ .

THH SAN- FRANCISCO' OALIi.Sr/NDAY, -FEBRUARY- -9, 1902.
Rows were frequent during tho after
noon session. When court Â¦ finally ad
journed it was out of respect to the mem
ory of the sister., of- District Attorney
Bonner, "who passed away in' San Fran
cisco on Friday morning. i .
Nichols continued his testimony this
afternoon. It was generally a confirma
tion of that given by his wife, Mr. Crow
ley and Mrs. Rucker. Raker caused him
to review his movements on May 30 and
until he went to bed, about 1 o'clock in
the morning of May 31 after returning
from Myers' Hotel, where ha had been
guarding the prisoners. Nichols said he
was awakened by pistol shots. He was
asked why ha did not get up and Investi
gate the cause of the shooting. An ob
jection was made and the court sustained
it, remarking that Nichols probably was
afraid to get up. . .
Proceed with the witness. I will stay here
until eternity cracks. You are raking
with a fine comb and asking all the questions
on God's earth that your depleted brain sug
gests.
ALTURAS, Feb. 8.-Richard Nichols, a
witness for the defense, occupied the en
tire day in the trial of James W. Brown
for complicity in the lynching of Calvin
Hall, his two sons, Daniel Yantis and
Martin Wilson last May. Nichols' testi
mony was a complete denial of the evi
dence given by John Hutton and Claude
Morris and a refutation of their confes
sions. Raker, as usual, attempted to ask
"educating" questions. Time after time
he was cautioned and the court remarked
on one occasion: . .. ..,

All old people's muscles get weak and flabby, and it's, the same
with. the muscular walls of their intestines as with the muscles of their
arms. When the 'bowels grow weak, the old folks get constipated,
bilious, sick, helpless, irritable, and that's the chief cause of their
death. . Old folks should take Cascarets Candy Cathartic bowel tonic,
keep their liver lively, their bowels regular and strong and live to be

from y 2 to 1 teaspoonful in a wine glass
of water internally. This starts up a
vigorous circulation of the blood, which
puts the inflammation out like water
puts out fire. It is a wonderful medicine;
it softens, loosens, heals, allays and re-
moves inflammation and brines quick
relief when others fail. You ought to

one is good for the others, and Halpru-

the relief and cure you ou^ht to have.
Pains in the throat and chest are
liable to be serious pains. When inflam-
mation gets into the throat or chest you
want to get it out as quickly as you can,
for they are the tender organs of the
body and it does not take disease long
to get a foothold that will cause you
endless misery and perhaps death.

distinction, a round dozen sit
uations that strike fire and a
production of rare splendor, "In
the Palace of the King," at the
Columbia this week, has much more than
fulfilled Its promise. One expected little
from the fatal fertility of Mr. Crawford,
author of the book, more from the dram
atist. Lorlmer Stoddard, who fitted Mrs.
Flske with her Btrong play. "Tess of the
DTJrbervllles." but most from Miss Al
len, wbose place here is second to none
In public liking. But Mr. Crawford has
furnished the dramatist with a story of
true romantic flavor, easily susceptible to
dramatic treatment and picturesque to
at degree. He has drawn the before-men
tioned half dozen characters with a clear
ness of touch that left only the work of
direct transference from story to stage
for the dramatist, and has further af
forded a novel field of effort to the artist
In Bettings, the magnificences of the
Spanish courts having been exploited
with much less frequency than the
eplendors of other royal arenas. Mr.
Etoddard, the promising and lovable
young playwright, who met death too
coon, has done as much for Mr.
Crawford as Mr. Crawford has done for
him. He has filled out the lines in har
monious fashion â and they are pitched in
BUfficIently stately key by the author â he
has strengthened the climaxes, Introduced
a Cardinal and several minor characters
Into the cast, and tactfully fitted the in
cident into greater dramatic effectiveness.
As It Is, and more especially as it is done
by MIes Allen and her company, "In the
Palace of the King" Is a thoroughly en
joyable play, stirring and picturesque and
replete with interest of one kind or an
other from beginning to end. It Is not a
great play in any sense of the word, and
Trfll go the way of other dramatic
ephemera soon or late, but in the mean
time "In the Palace of the King" will
serve an evening's turn better than most,
end Is certain of an audience so long as
Miss Allen and her company have it in
hand.
{ * â¢ â¢
One of the strongest portraits in the
play is that of King Philip of Spain, dono
by "W. E. Bonney, whose Nero in the orig
inal "Quo Vadls" left its mark on things
theatrical. Mr. Bonney once upon a time
was the private secretary of Rich&rd
Mansfield, who taught him tp act. From
this good school Mr. Bonney went to the
Adelphi Theater In London.
Miss Allen returns to us a full-fledged
star, and as Dolores de Mendoza, beloved
of the king's brother, has an opportunity
to exhibit to excellent advantage her
many-sided accomplishment. A creature
of quick mood, romantic, willful, capable
and deep-hearted, Dolores de Mendoza is
an attractive figure, and Miss Allen brings,
to the conception almost everything neces
sary to its best interpretation.

It is stated that since 1889 Liverpool has increased its population by 78,000 and during
the same time the number of cases of drunkenness apprehended by the .police have diminished
from 16,000 to 4180 a year, its criminal offenses from 926 to 552 per 100,000 inhabitants, and it
has been found possible to diminish the police force by 100 men without harm to the safety of
the city. All of this decrease of vice and crime while the population was increasing is attributed
by John Burns; the London labor leader, to the fact that during the eieveh years the Liverpool
authorities closed up 345 saloons in the slums of the city where excessive drinking . 'and crime
wye prevalent. , ".;Â»"-
The Indiana courts are said to have decided in the case of Christiansen vs. Crum that the

titles the survivor to compensatory damages; so it: seems, now that the* engaged man can find no
relief even in the grave, and a new terror has been added to society.

None will deny that the belief thus expressed is essentially neither will any one
question that the aspiration is excellent. There are a good many things that might be settled by
a world legislature, just as the Chinese indemnity question was settled by the joint action of the
powers. It happens, however, that such international action as has taken place so far does not
commend itself to mankind. Still the Massachusetts movement merits attention. It affords a
good subject for discussion at the debating, societies during the winter and is altogether the best
thing that has been produced by a State solon this year. -
The petitioners say: "We hold that mankind is ir^ reality one organic body. * * * We
look forward to the development of the organic political unity of mankind until each nation shall
be represented in the world legislature when the concerns of all mankind shall be acted upon by
the representatives of all mankind, for the peace and welfare of all." j -
In seeking the creation of a. world congress the Massachusetts petitioners do not ask that all
nations be invited to take part in it. Such a scheme would be impracticable, and, moreover, it
would offer no strong inducements to the great powers. The plan is that ten nations be invited
to assemble through duly accredited delegates to formulate a world constitution, lay down laws
and then request the outsiders to come and be good. That gives the ten a chance to do big pol
itics at the start.
It will be as easy for a President of the United States to institute a "movement for the estab
lishment of a world congress as it was for the Czar to institute a ; peace congress and bring about
the establishment of the High Court of Nations to serve as a tribunal for international arbitration.
In fact since such a court has been established and meets once in a while to have a dinner and to
show itself grateful for being alive, it is but fitting there should be a world congress to make laws
for/ the court to construe. All that is quite evident, and this movement, then, has a logical reason
for going ahead if it can: _.Â¦>-Â¦
. . Ordinarily at this season the country receives quite a variety of new impulses from re-
formers acting upon State Legislatures. This, however, is an off year for impulses' of the kind,
because comparatively few States have Legislatures in session this winter, so we must be the more
thankful for the one movement that comes to us. Fortunately it is large enough to cause no end
of talk, and is so little likely to move rapidly even when started that almost any number of persons
can give it a helping hand without fear of precipitating it like an avalanche upon an unsuspect
ing world. ' â¢ â¢
MASSACHUSETTS is pondering 3 petition recently presented to her Legislature re
questing the adoption of resolutions calling upon Congress to empower the President
of the United States to institute a movement for the establishment of a world congress.
The proposition is the first step in the way of practical politics to bring about the re
alization of Tennyson's "parliament of man; the federation of the world."

The chance to hear two symphony or-:
chestras in one day comes rarely enough
anywhere. It is a musical miracle out
here, and as an opportunity of close com
parison as valuable as it is rare. The
Rosenbecker Orchestra is an institution
of some six or seven years' standing, ours
of hardly so many weeks, and
comparisons will therefore necessa
rily â¢ be of a purely relative order.
It is doubtful if there be any
better material In the foreign orchestra
than in the home band; neither Is it likely
that the Chicago leader is a more efficient
conductor than Mr. Stelndorff, but there
Is the handsome advantage on the visit
ors' side of seven years' playing In con
cert and all that that implies. It is now
to see what seven years will do for the
home Institution. The Chicago orchestra
numbers less by five men than the San
Francisco symphony orchestra, by the
way. But it is going to be a unique and
valuable experience in the local ' concert
goers' history and It Is entirely likely
that the same audience will crowd both
theaters.
The coming week will be given over to
the symphony concert of Friday after
noon and the Hofmann recitals of
Wednesday evening and Saturday after
noon. Then will come (D. V.) three Nor
dica recitals in the following week, the
musical month closing with the symphony
concerts of the Stelndorfl and Rosenbeck
er orchestras. The disastrous happening
of January 31, when the symphony con
cert and Hofmann recital came together,
was almost repeated, by the way, the vis
iting orchestra escaping collision with the
local organization only by the fact of one
giving an afternoon, the other an evening
concert. But this, far from detracting
from either event, will go to add largely
to the attractiveness of both.
OUR musical entertainment of
late seems to have been con
ducted on the "feast or famine"
plan. It was a famine week
last week, owing to the Nor
dica disappointment, but there seem few
weeks of the kind ahead for some time
yet,.' the days seeming rather to promise
an embarrassment of riches than other
wise.

ly set that which should be coming to him
as a pioneer of the 'symphonic art In San
Francisco. A thousand vexations, a thou
sand difficulties, and hard work In terrify
ing quantity, are Inevitably hia who will
conduct the earlier concerts of a sym
phony society. Mr.' Steindorff Is doubly
unfortunate In coming efter a long record
of failureâ as regards permanenceâ of
symphony societies here, and has had,
slnglehanded, to lift the level of hope to
where It was before symphony had been
tried and had failed. That he has dons
so well, so soon, argues volumes both for
the conductor and his men, not forgetting
Mr. Mlnettl, whose concertmelstershlp Is
no sinecure. It speaks well, too, for the
lovers of symphony, who have, shown
their friendliness In Â¦ substantial and un
mistakable fashion, though, a still more
substantial support Is essential to set the
youthful society firmly on Its feet.
The progress of the band has been from
good to better right from the beginning,
and the last concert was creditable to a
degree, that is, the Dvorak symphony, for
that is all I heard. But It should be re
membered, and again remembered, that
come and go what will In the line of mu
sic, the symphony concert Is legitimately
first in the consideration of those who
would help to a knowledge of that which
comes nearest the song of the "choir

But for all thatj and conceding the correctness of the 'position of the House, the Execu
tive is charged with the execution of the law, and if that co-ordinate branch of the Government
choose to consider a tariff invading treaty as the law of the land, and order" its observance by the
Collectors of Customs, the remedy of the House is obscure. Only a decision of the Supreme
Court can settle it, and it may be questioned whether the traditions of the court will permit it to
interfere in such a dispute between one branch of Congress and the other and the Executive. Yet
it is the most important constitutional question that has arisen since the secession of South Caro
lina. The House may strike back by letting revenue fail or by refusing legislative intercourse with
the Senate. But that will not interpret the^constitution nor settle the issue.-. . . .
The report of the Ways and Means Committee will be awaited with the keenest interest. â¢â¢-'-
To go further than that, it is highly probable that not only tHe treaty-making power but
the power of the whole government would have been held incompetent to extend such an exclu
sive favor to one among the many nations with'which we sustained commercial relations.
A study of the subject reveals the probable intention and belief of the makers of the con
stitution that the treaty making powers of the Executive and Senate would be used only. in con
cluding peace, arranging such international matters as expatriation, boundary and extradition. In
the state of our commerce in 1789, the date of,the inauguration of the constitution, there was) no
discussion at all of any arrangement by which one nation might purchase abatement of our tariff
rates by the reciprocal lowering of its own for our benefit. The first tariff passed by the first
Congress contained no such provision, and there is no doubt that if the subject had arisen then, it
would have been treated as an extra-constitutional proceeding unless with the concurrence of
the House.
Mr. Payne and the members of the majority who discussed the resolution, and favored its
reference to the committee instead of adoption by the House, all took occasion to affirm their
indorsement of Mr. Richardson's position, and there was, no dissent on the floor of that chamber.
fit is evident, therefore, that a battle royal is at hand between the two branches of Con
gress. It is difficult to see what means of defense the House will have, no matter how well con
vinced of the rightfulness of its position.
The Speaker ruled properly that a threat to infringe the rights of the House was not an
infringement. Discussion was had by Messrs. Jenkins, Tawney and Richardson, and the Ways
and Means Committee was ordered to investigate the whole subject and report findings to the
House, which would equip it with the instruments of defense," as soon as the Senate challenged it
Mr. Richardson's resolutions were referred to the Ways and Means Committee. These reso
lutions declare that:- "It is the sense of this House that the negotiation by the Executive of a com- .
mercial treaty whereby rates of duty imposed on goods entering the United States should be
fixed would, in view of section % article I, of the constitution, be an infraction of the constitution
and an invasion of one of the highest prerogatives of the House of Representatives."
the Senate could raise the issue between the two houses.
Mr. Payne, the majority leader, raised the point of order that pending and incompleted
action of the Senate could not be taken as such evidence, and tliat only the completed action of
On January 31 Mr. Richardson of Tennessee, the minority leader, introduced resolutions
citing the pending reciprocity treaties as evidence of the intention of the Senate to override the
prerogatives of the House.
r, HE CALL, in discussing the constitutional primacy of the House' in revenue legislation,
forecast what has happened as the result of the pending effort for tariff abatement by
reciprocity generally, "and for free trade with- Cuba. This issue was really made whenjMr.
Blaine advised that high- rates in the tariff be used to incite requests for reciprocity, but
it was not then seen. to be the initiative of a struggle for prerogative between the House, and Sen
ate. That struggle has now ripened, and, since we predicted it, has been precipitated. %

who were convicted of kidnaping and
murdering a number of their fellow coun
trymen, were executed on January 22 at
Nueva Caceres, Southern Camarines. Mo
desto de la Cruz, who stabbed a native
woman for screaming while her husband
was being murdered, was hanged last
Wednesday. Ciro Decampo, who killed a
sergeant of the Hollo police, appointed by
the Americans, was executed on the same
day as De la Cruz. Pedro Corpus, who
killed a fellow occupant of an American
guardhouse at Cauayan, province of Isa
bella, for giving important information to
his captors, was hanged on January 22. -
Scores of other natives were convicted
of murder at about the same time as the
preceding, but by reason of extenuating
circumstances their sentences were com
muted to various terms of imprisonment.
Hundreds of Filipinos from Zamboanga
to Aparrl were convicted of lesser crimes
and received severe sentences.
Many Other Executions.
General Chaffee in approving the sen
tence says: "The laws of war provide but
one adequate penalty for the soldier who
deserts his flag to fight in the ranks of
the enemy against his own. people. The
sentence ls confirmed." Â¦
Appeal was made to President Roose
velt, but he declined to interfere.
The deserters were able to elude their
pursuers for several months, but were
driven at last by privations and fear to
surrender themselves. Their plea was
that they were intoxicated at the time of
their desertion, but their guilt was con
clusively proven to the officers of the
commission and the men were sentenced
to death. ,
Edmund A. Du Bose and Lewis Russell,
deserters from the Ninth (colored) Cav
alry, were hanged at Gulnobatan, pro
vince of Albay, Luzon, last Friday. The
records of the commission show that the
two men became dissatisfied with the
army and deserted about a year ago.
When they left they took with them six
carbines, 600 rounds of ammunition and
other Government property. The arms
were handed over to Colonel Toledo, who
was at that time operating against the
Americans in Albay. The men received
commissions as lieutenants in the insur
gent army and commenced leading raids
against their own countrymen. Through
their agency the American forces suffered
considerable injury in minor encounters.

Reports of the proceedings of the Phil

army headquarters yesterday, show that
present conditions in that part of our new

Crime of every kind is rampant through
out all the Islands occupied by the Ameri
cans. Assassinations among the natives
are of e very-day occurrence. Armed re
sistance against the forces of the United
States, ' however, ls constantly diminish
ing, and it is expected that the rigid en
forcement of the laws promulgated by the
civil commission and the commanding
general will soon put a stop to the minor
disorders. The most severe punishment is
being meted out to offenders, and Â¦ a
wholesome respect for the majesty of the
laws will undoubtedly be Inculcated in the
natives when they realize that their mis
deeds will not be condoned.

the various ships and stations are Invited to
Bollclt a contribution on February 22 from all
under their command of an equivalent of one
day's pay. Â¦â¢â¢ â¢Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ ; Â¦ ;â¢..;.
Resolved,. That the . United States Naval
Academy Graduates' Association In California
heartily Indorses the plan for securing a home
or clubhouse at Vallejo'- for the use of the
United States sailors and marine* and pledges
itself to earnestly aid in the work: and it la
hereby further Â¦ - . Â¦ > â¢
. A general committee having already been
Invited to take up the work, the aid and sup
port of this association should be accorded and
it is therefore , â¢ Â«Â¦â¢"Â«
It is but little known how much this work
is required and it is apparent that there are
many both within and without, the service
who would he glad to assist and to contribute
toward the needed funds.
There Is much of monotony in * "Jack's" life.
"When on duty and when ashore, he requires a
ctange. He needs some of the benefits which
the officer and the citizen finds In the gentle
man's club. HÂ£ needs a place of protection
from the proverbial land shark and the sailor
boarding-houseâ a plates where he may " find
good reading matter and a good restaurant
reasonable amusements and clean and com
fortable lodgingsâ all freed from the tempta
tions of strong drink and the snares of the
saloon. , , :
All good people to whom this greeting may
come, whether by receipt of this circular or
by notice through the public press, are urged
to make contribution on or before the 'good
day named, viz. â February 22. Any member
of the general committee will accept contri
butions and the Â¦ principal newspaper offices
will render a like service. - . ,.â, .
TTrge Contributions.
Pay Inspector J. R. Stanton, 800 Market
street, San Francisco, will receive and account
for the funds.
Let the graduates in civil life lend their aid
toward Interesting the public and let officers
and men in service give each their mite. It
has been suggested that each officer and man
in aervlce upon this coast- contribute the
amount of one day' s pay, and that a day be
set for this purpose. In order that there may
be "a good pull, a strong pull and a pull to
gether," it is proposed that the commander
cl every ship and station upon, the coast In
vite contributions from his entire command of
the equivalent of a day's pay, say on Feb
ruary 22 â a good day for a good deed.
It is specially appropriate that the graduates
of the naval academy upon this coast should
take the lead in this good work and this
association pledges Itself to the cause. Â¦
The cause is one which should appeal to all
who have any realization or the peculiar
temptations to which "Jack" is exposed when
on shore and to those who are interested that
he should have some fair and reasonable oppor
tunity to escape them.
Through the exceeding generosity of Captain
B. H. McCalla, who has given the entire
amount of his prize money from the Spanish-
American war (more than $5000) a large city
lot has already been obtained. Funds are now
needed for a suitable building.
To the Friends of the Man Behind the Gun â
Stimulated by . the great benefits which have
been derived from the two admirable Institu
tions now in operation at Brooklyn, N. Y..
and Newport, R. I., it Is proposed to provide
at Vallejo, Cal., a clubhouse or home for the
use and benefit of the United States sailors
and marines.

WHY ALL COUGHS
ARE DANGEROUS
t
NO MATTER HOW SLIGHT.
All coughs are caused by an Irritation or
Inflammation of the membrane lining the
air passages in the throat, bronchial tubes j
and lungs, and no matter how slight are !
a menace to the' life of the individual
suffering from the same.
All cases of bronchitis, pneumonia ant
consumption are in the first place con-
tracted through the membrane lining- the
air passages. Every day, especially at
this season of the year, we inhale the
germs of these diseases in every breath.
If the respiratory organs are inflamed or
irritated, no matter to how small an ex-
tent, these germs find lodgment on the
inflamed surfaces, receive nourishment,
and multiply with great rapidity.
The germs of an ordinary cough on'y
live from five- to nine days, during their
life inflame the membrane and thus the
germs of other diseases are enabled to ob-
tain a foothold.
Heretofore there was some excuse for
neglecting a cough or cold, as no stom-
ach medicine ever invented could do any-
thing but deaden the effects of cough
germs. Â£ .
Now, however, it is only through negli-
gence that these germs are allowed to
exist for twenty-four hours, for Hyomei,
the new dry air germicide, is the first and
only remedy known that will destroy the
germs causing respiratory diseases and
which' can be inhaled in the air we
breathe, the method by which such germs
can be reached.
There is now no necessity for any man,
woman or child suffering with coughs,
colds, catarrh, croup, bronchitis or con-
sumption, if they will take the advice of
the United States Health Reports and
breathe Hyomei daily.
Hyomei ls sold by all druggists i or : sent by
mall. You can* get a trial outfit for 25c or a
complete ona for $1.00. You can also receive
a five days' treatment free by applying to The

in bringing tog-ether well-known athletes.
No record was smashed, the sprints by
necessity being broken into many heats
and the track being too crowded in the
distance runs to permit any brilliant
burst of speed. The number of men com

It Is g-ood to gra^p an honest hand â con
' cisting of four acers.
The vagaries of form were vividly il
lustrated in the closing mile and fifty
yard run. A universal plunge cut the
price against Bab from 10 to 4, and the
mare won all the way. Formero, the fa
vorite, lost the place to Urchin.
Jack Atkin's Diderot went to the post
a 3 to 5 chance for the mile and a fur
long run, and, hustled along at the close,
led out Constable three lengths. Com
missioner Forster lost second place by a
nose only.
Strangely enough, Pat Morrissey, a 2 to
5 favorite, could not outrun Nilgar for
the seven furlong run, the outsider romp
ing in first by four lengths. Lodestar, a
40 to 1 chance, downed the poorly handled
Mission for the show.
Overconfidence on the part of O'Connor
undoubtedly lost the two-year-old half
mile dash lor the 3 to 10 favorite, Sylvia
Talbot. She took the lead almost from
tne start, and in the stretch appeared to
be winning Easily. In the last seventy
yards Buliman on Adirondack drew his
whip and the game little fellow forged
ahead, beating the favorite a neck. High
Chancellor was third.
on nil recent mud lonn tne black mare
Eldred looked a "moral" for the first of
tenns en the card, a five furlong sprint,
and her odas rapidly fell from even money
to 3 to 5. fane tried to run out around the
iar turn, but outfooted El Karri in the
run home, winning, ridden out, by a
length. Master Lee closed well, taking
the show.
>Vhile it was expected that favorites
would have things tneir own way, Kldred,
Muresca and Diderot were the only suc
cesstui ones. . Adirondack, Nilgar and
Bab ail scored at long odds.
Muresca, a 3 to 5 favorite, went to the
front and leading by a hair-dozen lengths
throughout won easily from Colonial Ulri.
Redfern, a feather-weight, roue the lat
ter and could not help tier the least. Do
reen ran third, and an unsatisfactorny
decided $2500 stake is a thing or the past.
Satchel nnished last, beaten fifty lengths.
"W. jyÂ£. Rogers, owner of Colonial Girl,
supposed up to noon yesterday that
O'Connor was to ride his filly. Arriving
at the track he discovered the New York
Jockey was to pilot Satchel, absolutely
without a chance. On her recent bad per
formances she was not expected to start.
However, Barney Schreiber claimed that
he engaged O'Connor three months ago
to ride his entry, through "Dutch" Lewis,
then manager for O'Connor. Three weeks
ago 'Willie i)oane, "vhe ex-jockey and valet

Many are inclined to thuiK Lynch got in

One. regrettable feature of the race was
that a. dispute over the services of Winnie
O'Connor, on a ruling of the Judges, with
the evidence before /them; prevented Co
lonial Girl, undoubtedly the best of the
seven starters, from winning. As Is ap

The British ship Montgomeryshire,
which arrived here yesterday, 126 days
from Swansea, had a most monotonous
voyage up to within five days of reach-
Ing port. Captain Edwards declares that
most of the voyage there was no wind at
all, and when there was any It was too
Hjrht for any enthusiasm. Six days ago,
however, a snorting southeasterly gale
came along and with it a thick, wet fog,
and through this combination of elements
out of tune the Montgomeryshire fought
her way for five days. Â£he brings a cargo
of coal.
The Pacific Mail steamship City .of Syd
ney sailed yesterday for Panama and way
ports with about thirty cabin passengers
and a full cargo. Although she got away
from the dock en schedule time she was
obliged to anchor in the harbor until the
sea on the bar calmed down sufficiently
to Insure a safe crossing. Among the
cabin passengers were Mrs. "W. V. Bryan
and two children. Mrs. Bryan chaperones
Miss Rowpna Burns. Miss Belle Sturtde

The Pacific Mall steamship Acapulco ar
rived off the port early Friday morning,
but not until yesterday did she reach her

day both banks were breaking fiercely,

to attempt the crossing. All day long
the liner bobbed at her anchor In the

Cured of Piles,

The manufacturers of the -new catarrh cure,
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, have succeeded ad-
mirably in accomplishing this result. They are
large, pleasant tasting lozenges, to be dis-
solved in the mouth, thus reaching every part
of the mucous membrane of the throat and
finally the stomach. .
Unlike many catarrh remedies Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets contain no cocaine, opiate or any
injurious drug whatever and are equally bene-
ficial for little children and adults.
Mr. C R. Rembrandt of Rochester, 1 N. T..
says : "I know of few people who have suf-
fered as much as I from Catarrh of the head,
throat and stomach. I used sprays, Inhalers
and powders for months at a time with only
slight relief, and had no hope of cure. I had
not the means to. make a change of climate,
which seemed my only chance of cure.
"Last spring 1 read an account of some re-
markable cures made by Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets and promptly bought a fifty cent box from
my druggist and obtained such positive benefit
from that one package that I continued to use
them dally, until I now consider myself en-
tirely free from the disgusting annoyance of
catarrh: my head is clear, my digestion all I
could ask and my hearing, which had begun
to fall as a result of the catarrh, . has greatly
Improved, until I feel I can hear as well as
ever. They are a household necessity in my
family.": - \ - Â¦ Â¦â¢'Â¦-.â¢/â¢â¢ y. '--Â¦- .Â¦ Â¦-Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ .
Â¦ Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are sold by drug-
gists at 60 cents for complete treatment, and
tor convenience, safety and prompt results they
are undoubtedly the long looked for catarrh
cure. .'-- \ Â¦ -. - â¢â¢ Â¦ --. â¢ Â¦ ':Â¦--:.Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦
The. best and most modern remedies for this
purpose are antiseptics scientifically known as
Eucalyptol, Guaiacol, Sanguinaria and Hydras-
tin, end v.-hlle each of these have been success-
fully used separately, yet It has been difficult
to get them all combined in one palatable, con-
venient and efficient form. . >
A .remedy to really cure catarrh must be an
Internal remedy which will cleanse the blood
from catarrhal poison and remove the fever
and congestion from, the mucous membrane.
The catarrhal poison ls In the blood and the
mucous membrane of the nose, throat and
trachea tries to relieve the system by secret-
Ing large quantities of mucus, the discharge
sometimes closing up the nostrils, dropping
intp the throat, causing deafness by closing the
Eustachian tubes, and after a time causing
catarrh of stomach or serious throat and lung
trouble. Â¦ ,
if they accomplish anything at all, simply give
transient relief.

"About six months ago while still half
sick and very weak I commenced to use
Grape-Nuts Breakfast Food and soon
noticed an Improvement In my general
health, with the gradual disappearance of
unfavorable symptoms. Heart palpitation
decreased and a new feeling of vigor
manifested itself in various ways. Tonics
were no longer needed, bowels became
natural, nerves were steady and I seemed
to have returned. In a great degree, to the
vigor of middle age. There has also been
a gain in flesh, my weight having In-
creased from 137 to 151 pounds.

the advice with some benefit, but was still

extent.

Â» Demos Chapman, colored, was sentenced
to Seven years at San Quentin for bur
glary by Judge Dunne yesterday. Chap
man broke into a room occupied by a sol
dier. ' He said he was drunk and "had
made a mistake, but pleaded guilty never

1 Henry Stone pleaded guilty before Judge
Cook yesterday to a charge of burglary
and the Judge sentenced him to ten years
In San Quentin. A; M. Johnston, charged
with the same offense, pleaded not guilty,
and his case was continued till next Sat
urday, to-be set- for -trial... They, were
charged with breaking into the store of
Rice & Shane, 60 Market street, on the
night of December 22 and stealing a quan
tity of cigars.- -
The trials were characterized by the most
desperate efforts to defeat Justice. â¢ The tree
manner in .which false swearing was indulged,
even in purelyvcollateral matters, showed a
marked depravity, but, fortunately for the ad
ministration of justice, the truth prevailed.
Such a verdict as haa been rendered in this
case was greatly needed. It, is a fact of com
mon knowledge that there are many creatures
in this community who seek to deal in the
souls of Jmmature girls from the basest of
motives. . And Â¦when ,'- such transactions are
made the subject of judicial inquiry reliance
for escape from merited punishment is gen
erally placed upon the very weaknesses of the
misguided minors, whose further demoraliza
tion they seek. -But, while the previous de
linquencies of the minor is so often depended
upon to defeat prosecution of this offense, this
is not the test" of the. law and should only
serve to aggravate the criminal act. l It : is
time that something was done to discourage
this nefarious traffic.- "-
Anthony Adams, John H. Wilson-and
Michael Healy, who were i convicted by a
jury in .Judge Lawlor's court on the
charge 'of assault with Intent to commit
robbery, appeared for sentence yesterday.
Adams and Wilson were each sentenced
to five years in San Quentin and Healy
to six years. On the night of November
13 they attempted . to rob William Harl
ton at First and Mission streets and were
caught by; Detectives Regan and O'Con

the leader, hence his increased , punish

the jury not recommended him to the

"It is the want of money and not the
want of wheat that brings so. much suf

during my stay in India, but they have
been confined to certain districts. The

with wheat, for the warehouses are full,

: sf^*. AKLAND, Feb.". 8.â Dr. Maud Al-
Yl ' lV len> a niedical missionary from
II ]| India, who arrived yesterday
on the steamer Doric after an ab
sence of seven years, says that It
is foolish for the American people to send
ships full of wheat for the succor of the
famine sufferers, because there never is
any realdearth of cereals in that empire.
It is the rapacity of the money-lenders
that starves the suffering natives at the
same time that India is actually export
ing wheat to other countries. .
"There Is a class of men there called
Banyas," said Dr. Allen, "who are the
owners of the money. . They are
avaricious i and- have,-, no > compunc
tion about charging 'â¢ the highest price
for the use of their ! money. Hundreds
may be starving around them, but they
are unmoved. They get a 'corner 1 on the
product of the farmers there just a3 la
done in America. If there Is a failure of
crops in one province the price of wheat
of course g6es up to a figure that makes ;
it prohibitive to the people of the stricken
district. The wages are small that It is
impossible for the natives to save any
thing, and they are always at the mercy
of the Banyas. . . Â¦ ;

"The greatest 'difficulty we have to

impossible to break in upon them. The

are abominable. The people do not know
what unselfishness is among themselves.
They think there is a motive for every
thing that you do for them. The

the Christians are kind to them because
they want to force their creed upon them
"The pictures you see. of starving na

- It gives me much pleasure to recommend to
the public. Mr., George Mayerle of 1071 Market
street, San Francisco, strictly as a skillful and
expert optician. My sight began to fall in 1877,
just twenty r nve years ago, and since that time
I Â¦ have been wearing glasses. I consulted a
prominent ontician in Chicago, Dr. Holmes. At
different times â¢ since that " I have had lenses
fitted on in St. Louis, Cleveland, O., and also
tried the Fifth avenue opticians in Plttsburg,
who claim to be among. the best in their line
in the country., -I do not hesitate to say that I
have met with better and. more satisfactory re-
sults : with Mr. Mayerle than with any of the
above named, who have, much higher preten-
sions. Respectfully, â¢ . Â¦â¢ 'Â¦-..

to her that the money was being invested
in a Japanese fancy goods store owned by
his uncle. It Is understood, that Mrs. Dan
iels loaned the .'Japanese more than $100
without security." This servant also robbed

Attorney Eugene Deuprey borrowed
$1000 on a promissory note, which has bo
come outlawed.
Deuprey, Borrowed Money.
Since that time Miss Margaret Royer, a
niece of Mrs. Daniels, married one of the
Halpin boys and for'thSs act was dis
owned by the aunt. Since the marriage
Mrs. Daniels has never seen her, niece nor
heard of her until she instituted proceed
ings to be appointed her guardian.
Some years after. the death of Mr. Louth
the widow married Mr. Daniels, who died'
eight years ago, leaving, her. $20,00o. With
this money she made an Investment in
real estate at the corner of Â¦â¢ Taylor arid
Geary streets, buying | * the ' Â¦ i property
through the firm of Burnham & Marsh
Subsequently she sold it at a loss of $2003
With the proceeds derived from the sale
of ; that property she invested in real es
tate at the northwest corner of Page and
Devisadero streets, which is now occupied
by Dr. Williamson of the Board of Health
She also purchased a piece of property on
Ashbury street, between Waller and Fred
erlcK, I paying about $12,500. About two
years ago she was. induced to exchange
the property on the northwest corner of
Page and Devisadero streets for the prop
erty on the southwest corner of the same'
streets, paying a bonus of $3500, but upon
which she assumed a mortgage of $630o at
the- French Bank. This was an unfortu
nate investment, as the flats were not
permanently rented and .the income from
her property not sufficient to meet her ex
penses: The following year Mrs. Daniels
assumed a mortgage on her Ashbury
street property for $1000. , uy
The examination was soon concludod.7
Further testimony will be taken, in court'
on Monday, next. The hearing comes 'up
on: a petition of Mrs. Mary Hatpin, a
niece of .Mrs.- Daniels, praying that she
be appointed Mrs. Daniels' guardian. She
is represented by Attorney Matt. 1...Sulli
van. The . Call published ' yesterday the
story of Mrs. Daniels' real estate transac
tions. The lady has a very * interesting
history. She was formerly a Miss Ken
nedy, daughter of a well-to-do resident' of
this city. At the age of 17 she married
John Louth, a dry goods merchant of pio
neer days. At the time of his death he
left property valued at $57,000. In his will
Mr. Louth devised a substantial sum to
benevolent Institutions, and the S main
beneficiaries under the will were*his two
nephews, known.- as the "Halpin boys."-
His widow, j now' Mrs. Daniels, was pro
vided for, but inadequately. As the will
was made a few hours before Mr. Louth's
death Mrs. Â¦ Daniels tried . to have it an
nulled. The Halpin boys were represent
ed by Attorney Sullivan. They were ex
ecutors under the will.- Mrs. Daniels was
defeated and only received $5000 out of the
estate of her husband. Â¦ , Â¦:
"No!" exclaimed the witness vehement
ly; "I hate them." ' â¢ - , Â¦Â¦.
"Now, Mrs. Daniels, if In the judgment
of the court he deems it fit to protect your
interests by the appointment of a guar
dian, do you want Mrs. Halpin or Mrs.
.Tamer?" J.
Hates Them Both.
"No, I am sane," emphatically answered
th* witness. Â¦ - r - s
"Do you . understand, Mrs. ; /Daniels,"
asked Fuhrman, ''that. we. are conducting
proceedings looking for the appointment
of a guardian over you? Do you want a
guardian?" - Â¦; .
'Mrs. ; Daniels -was -able 'to recognize' a
power of attorney she gave Mr. Fuhrman
las t. No/ytpmher,. to- dispose^&f , her^prope, r*y,
pay her deots" and? feectfre ay'permanent
lioim: for her in' sonie^" worthy institution,
where she could spend the rest of her days
in j.eac<x and quiet. .... v Â¦Â¦> . ; â¢
The examination. was conducted by the
court and Atorney Sullivan. They ques
tioned Mrs. Daniete at length, in order to
learn her mental condition. ; Although un
able to give expression to her thoughts
the witness was fully alive to the ques
tions asked her and was able to answer
with intelligence. Mr. Sullivan attempted
to demonstrate to the Judge that the lady
wbb entirely unable- to understand- her
business' and was mentally incompetent
to comprehend what had taKen place dur
ing the last year. Â¦'âÂ¦'â¢
Attorney Fuhrman tried to show that
ail her mental faculties were sound and
that, she was fully capable of understand
ing all that had taken place relative to
her affairs,' but that she , was physically
handicapped, ttrst by reason of the parai
ysis of her limbs, and secondly by her in
ability to convey by speech all she wished
to. by reason of the impairment of her
power, of speech. It developed that Mrs,
Daniels ,was stricken with apoplexy . in
November, 1300, and as<a result she is now
suffering from a paralysis of one-half of
her body and the impairment of speech. .
Attorney Sullivan tried to show . that
Mrs.: Daniels was unable to express what
her. .senses conceived, j In . order, to prove
his contention the attorney held up a pen*
cil and asked Ahe lady if he was not hold
ing a paper in his hand. She replied that
it was a pencil." He tried, other tests, but
failed. Re. examined her. at length about
her- property. -and: she was able to give
lucid. answers. 4 ''. . .' Â¦.'.Â»"-. .

Mrs. Daniels Is .a paralytic, but was able
to walk into the room where the examina
tion was held. She .was a trine bewildered
by the presence of court and counsel, but
upon .being reassured she bowed to the
gentlemen present and took a seat. The
lady has full possession of her mental fac
ulties; but is only able to speaK in mono

Xjibor Meeting 1 Passes Resolutions
Denouncing Chamber of Commerce
and Merchants' Exchange.
Under the auspices of the Labor Council
and thÂ« City Front Federation a meeting
was held last evening at Metropolitan
Temple to protest against the passage of
any legislation by Congress as suggested
by the Chamber of Commerce* and the
Merchants' Exchange to allow the unre
stricted, entrance into this country of Chi
nese merchants, salesmen, clerks, buyers,
bookkeepers, accountants, managers,
storekeepers, bankers and cashiers.
Michael Casey called the meeting to or
der and introduced Mayor Schmitz, who
In turn presented the speakers of the
evening. Ex-Congressman T. J. Geary
sent his regrets at not being able to be
present and expressed himself as favoring
close exclusion of Chinese;
Mayor Schmitz addressed the meeting
and said that the people of California
were united on the question of Chinese
exclusion and the present situation called
for careful and immediate action. \
W. Macarthur of the City Front Federa
â¢ tion delivered a long speech, in which he
accused the Chamber of Commerce and
the Merchants' Exchange of favoring the
open door for coolie labor. He asked that
the seamen of America be protected by
legislation and that no Chinese be em
ployed on American ships. He favored
only the admlsion of the representatives
of the Chinese Government and, perhaps,
the actual merchants and students of
China under certain conditions, but de
manded that coolie labor be barred. The
speaker declared that the resolutions
passed by the Chamber of Commerce and
the. Merchants' Exchange would. If adopt
ed by Congress, render the exclusion laws
Inoperative.
W. Malmsbury of the Building Trades
Council declared that if Congress would
not pass laws to keep all Chinese and
Japanese out of America the workmen of
California would do so by force.
A letter waa read by Mayor Schmitz
from Andrea Sbarboro in which the wri
ter declared he was not in favor of. the
resolutions passed by the Chamber of
Commerce and the Merchants' Exchange
and believed that many members of the
two commercial bodies had erred In voting
for the resolutions.

Seven Boers were killed and twelve
â¢wounded, nearly all belonging to the Kru

2s now practically accounted for.
The Scottish Horse took the main part
in the affair, acting with great gallantry.
The British loss was ten officers and men
â¢wounded.
JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 8.â At' 11
o'clock last Thursday' night Colonel
Kekewich. having ascertained the where
abouts of Commanaant Albert's laager
at Gruisfontein, sent men to capture it.
The British force arrived at daybreak
and immediately stampeded the horses of
the Boers with pompoms and a well di
rected rifle fire. The Boers were com
pletely surprised and after a short reply
to the, British attack practically the total
commando fell into the hands of the at
tacking force, who captured 131 prisoners,
Including Commandants Landrost and
Potgieler and Cornet Duplessis. .

Dr. Leyds, representative in Europe of
the Transvaal Government, is reported as
declaring that the recent proposals look-
Ing to the establishment of peace in South
Africa, made by the Dutch Minister, Dr.

VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. 8.â News
brought by the American coast service
vessel Grant, Captain Tozier, to Xanaimo
to-day set at rest all fears concerning tho
safety of the British ship Egeria. For
eleven days the Egeria had not been sight
ed by any of thÂ© passing coast vessels* 1
and marine men w.ere beginning to won
der If she, too, had joined ther Condor in
the depths of the Pacific.
On Wednesday the Grant sighted the
Egeria oft Cape Scott, at the northern end
of Vancouver Island, and the Egeria took
aboard from the Grant the ship's boat
which had belonged to the Condor and
which wa3 found recently by the west
coast Siwashes. The Egeria had. bÂ«en
more than 100 miles off shore, cruising
about in the hope of picking up other
wreckage, and was out of the course of
coastwise vessels.
The Grant made practically a circuit of
the island. No further evidence of either
Condor or Red Rock wreckage was found
on the west coast by the Grant, although
merabers of her crew searched Industri
ously all along the indented shore line.
They went into all the harbors, exploring
tide flats and exposed sand beaches where
pieces of boards or any other parts of the
tipper works of the warship might have
been washed up.

Judge Dibble fancied it would be wise
to limit the set speeches to one at each
daylight session. . |
Senator Lukens remarked that the citi
zens of. San Jose would accept any pro
gramme for the first two days, but they
wanted the third day for their own sched-'
ule of exercises. The Alameda Senator
said the clubs of his county were active
and' would send earnest delegates to the
convention. He fancied that Governor
Gage's address would be the feature of
one half-day's session, and appealingly
looked to Judge Dibble and Alden Ander
son for indorsement of his views. â¢ The
Senator expressed unbounded confidence
in the ability of Alameda County to win
back tho 'banner which San Francisco
captured in -1900. He. had no fears what
ever of the banner ever going back i to
Los Angeles County. He hoped the
Union league Club would send the trophy
to San Jose to be exhibited to the conven
tion. . /
The committee adjourned to meet in
March.

Orators Who Were Mentioned
Judge Carroll Cook holds that it is an
open question under the law as to wheth-.
er the Mayor or Governor has the power
to make a temporary appointment to the
office of clerk to the Justices'. Court. He
says that point will come up for decision
on the writ . of injunction obtained re
straining the Auditor from auditing Fred
rick's demand for eleven days in January.
Argument in this respect will begin" next
Thursday. : . â¢ . Â¦.
: Judge Cook announced from the bench
yesterday that the words "by the May
or," * which were contained in a certain
paragraph of his recent statement to the
Grand Jury, were inserted through a
mistake of his typewriter. As revised
and corrected the learned Judge's opinion
is as follows: ...
It is clear, however, under my view of the
law, that no successor to Mr/ Williams was
appointed by "the Board of Supervisors of this
city and county on a written recommendation
of the Justices of the Peace in 1900, nor .in
1002. and that, therefore, it Is the duty of
the present Board of Supervisors, on the writ
ten recommendation of the . Justices of the
peace, to appoint a clerk of the Justices' Court
under the provisions of section 86 of the Code
of Civil Procedure of this State above referred
to. In the interim and pending: the action of
such Board of Supervisors, my opinion, is that
the office must be filled in the manner pro
vided by law for the filling of vacancies In an
office created by statute, and does not rest
with Justices of the Peace, but such appoint
ment can only be a temporary appointment,
holding until the Supervisors act In the prem
ises.
The words "by the Mayor," which were
inserted by mistake, immediately fol
lowed the words, "but such appointment,"
as appear in the foregoing. '
The mistake gave the Judge's opinion
a meaning different from, what was In
tended. .It -is now clear that some on a
has the right to fill the vacancy and the
person appointed to nil the vacancy may
hold office until the Supervisors elect. It
has not yet been determined by the
courts whether the Mayor or the Gover
nor has the right to appoint to fill the
vacancy.. That Question, may go to tha
Supreme Court and ultimately be decided.
One learned Justice will write an opinion
artd some of his fellows on the bench will
concur in his jviews. Another learned
Justice will write a dissenting opinion and
several other learned Justices will stand
by the dissenter. As there will be two
opinions, one may happen to-be right.
Preparing for League Convention.
Alden Anderson, president of the State
League of Republican Clubs, exchanged
views with Senator R. G. Lukens pf Ala
meda and Henry C. Dibble of San Fran
cisco at the Palace Hotel yesterday on
the subject of a programme for the bien
nial convention of the league at San Jose
April 14, 15 and 16. It was announced by
President Anderson that the order of
business would be fixed by the conven
tion, but it was suggested that the pro
gramme committee should select - the
speakers and present topics for the con
vention to discuss. ' Senator Lukens asked
Alden Anderson if it were not the expec
tation that' Governor Gage would address
the convention on the opening day. The
president replied that the ; Gover
nor would be invited to speak.
It subsequently- transpired ; that Judge
A. G. Burnett of Santa Rosa,
Frank H. Short of Fresno, Duncan Mc-
Kinlay and M. Shortridge of San
Francisco had accepted to deliver what
may be teribed "set speeches." Mr. Mfc-
Klnlay elecjts to speak on the topic, "Ser
vice of the Club to the Party." â¢ Mr. Short
signified readiness to speak of "Our.Un
timely Dead."; -Mr.' Shortridge desires
time to reilect on- the selection- of his
topic.. Other orators 'than those em
braced in the list of "set -sneakers" will
address the convention. . For instance,
General W. H. L. Barnes and Henry. C.
Dibble have been invited. . If General
Barnes accepts he may be .placed in a
special class one degree higher than the
grade given to set speakers.
Supervisor Brauphart also attacked the
sincerity of the two commercial organi
zations and accused them' of representing
the steamship companies running from
this port to China. â¢ $â¢
W. A. Cole of the Building Trades Coun
cil said that the Chamber of Commerce
and the Merchants' Exchange had 'passed
resolutions in the hope or influencing Con
gress on the passage of the exclusion' laws
and that the patriotism, of the members
of the organizations' was measured by

v T. Boland of the Labor r Council t then
presented resolutions â¢-,. which '. denounced
the Chamber of- Commerce and the Mer

commercial bodies of using every effort
to secure the enactment of legislation pro
viding- for" the free entrance of coolie labor
into the United; States, and characterized
such action as- a conspiracy â¢ against' the
welfare ofjtfte people , Qf* America and
treacherous to Â¦ the interests .of the State
and -nation. 'The -resolutions requested 1

We know Brodrick wants conscription, though
perhaps In a modified form.. If bis Ideas 'win
the day the volunteers will gradually cease to
be an effective -force, and will thereby supply
the War Office with its strongest argument in
favor of compulsory military service, or the
enforcement of the old ballot laws. Rather
than see that come about we Intend to break
up our regiments. I have a letter from a dis
tinguished nobleman, urging' me to take that
course, and many other commanding officers

who had secured the passage of reso
lutions by the two organizations were re
ceiving thÂ« "dirty dollars of the transpor
tation companies engaged in bringing
cooiles to America," Â¦- ' . . â¢ â¢
The committee which Brodrick appoint
ed to hear the grievances only aggravated
matters. The commanders of the leading
regiments had' previously formed them
selves into a deputation to wait on Brod
rick, and he, temporarily, declined to see
them, but the Secretary for War stole a
march on the members of: the deputation
by announcing in the House of Commons
that he had appointed a committee of his
own, in which not one of .the deputation
was included. His action , created intense
feeling among the members of the orig
inal deputation, who privately declare
that the new volunteer regulations and
the "deadhead committee" were intro
duced for the sole purpose of making con
scription possible. The colonel of one of
the London regiments i said to a corre
spondent: :
While these stringent criticisms of the
War Office are being publicly accounted
there is proceeding beneath the surface
a revolt which threatens to be of even
greater importance. The leading author
ities of .the volunteers. Including many of
the commanders of the best known regi
ments, several of them being titled per
sons and nearly all wealthy, are holding
frequent meetings to decide on the best
method of defeating Brodrlck's new vol
unteer regulations. .
"The fact remains," adds the Saturday
Review, "that we have been swindled on
a very larsre scale."
These figures are expected to be pub
lished here soon, and when known will
doubtless add fuel to the fire of public
indignation, which threatens to center
around Secretary of War Brodrick as
vigorously as it did around Lord Lans
downe when the latter was sponsor for
the early blunders of the war. A dozen
or more committees of investigation are
now sitting or are in progress of forma*
tion, but as the Saturday Review nays,
"these are only too often synonyms ot
oblivion."
The opposition vainly endeavored to get
details regarding the new contracts for
the eupply of meat announced by the
Government In the .House of Commons,
with the view of ascertaining if a saving
over the former methods will really be
effected. The -Government successfully
avoided answering, but it is understood
that the contract in question 1 â¢ was flrat
resold at Â£10,000 premium and then at
Â£40,000, while Cecil Rhodes and the De
Beers group handed over Â£200,000 and thus
finally secured the privilege of supplying
the troops in South Africa with fresh
meat. . Â¦ â¢
LONDON, Feb. 8.â The apparent incom
petence and, it is claimed, possible dis
honesty which permeates the purchasing

vealed this week in. Parliament, have
caused a public agitation ' that augurs
badly for the War Office. . Judging ' f ixom

"Who does not remember that early scene In "Jane Eyre," where the
child, by nervousness, grows mutinous and impertinent? Or who has not
the recollection of some child in her circle of friends who has shown Itself
most unmanageable? There is the little golden haired boy whose chief aim
in life seems to be to pleaseâ yet the>e was a time when he, because of
something he had done, was told to go to his crib and lie there quietly. He
was not Quiet and the more his mother spoke to him, and the more he was
scolded and finally punished, the less quiet he became. Then there's an-
other child, who, upon having his hands tapped as a punishment, struck
back, and continued to strike back. And there's the child who gives the
saucy answersâ a bright little girl who told her grandmother to "shut up"
much to that lady's amazement, and the boy who told his aunt she was
1 riot his boss when she asked him to do something.
* Every one of these children had the best intentions in the world, and the
trouble in each case was that the child was nervous and didn't really know
what he was doing. Take the golden haired boy. When his mother made
him lie down he was overheated from play. The room was close and he
couldn't lie still. His mother scolded him, whipped him; but that didn't
make the room any cooler, and every thing merely resulted in making him
more nervous and more unwilling to obey.
The child who strikes back usually does it through Imitation. He is
worked up and nervous; before him stands his mother, nervous and excited,
punishing him, yet hardly knowing what she is doing. There is a fascina-
tion about it all, and before long: tha child finds himself imitating: his mother,
Â¦without really being conscious of the fact. He's nervous and does not know
â¢what he is doing.
The child who gives saucy answers is either being screamed at then or
is In the habit of being screamed at, and does not realize how naughty it
is in him. His mother is nervous and he, having watched her all along and
not understanding that coolness is an admirable quality, is nervous, too.
This is a generation of nervous women; but judging from the nervous
children now growing up the next will be even more so. On every side you
hear the remark, "He is such a nervous child," "She is so nervous I don't
know how she will ever get through her studies," and similar statements.
But the mothers who make these remarks do not stop to think that the
children are nervous because the mothers are nervous. Children are the
greatest imitators in the world. Td them the mother is the ideal and the ex-
smple in all things, and as she is so will they be.
"But," I hear many a mother exclaim, "how can I help being nervous?
1 I would gladly get over it if I could, but I cannot do so.V
It is true that in your present condition you cannot keep cool. Nervous-
ness is not an affectation to be done away with as so much merchandise.
It is a disease, or rather a symptom of a disease. You are nervous because
you are sicli You are nervous because the reproductive organs have some-
thing wrong with them. In your young womanhood you probably did nit
receive the attention you should have had. Your monthly illness came on
with pain. Even now you have discharges that should not exist; you have
a pain in your back that often makes you feel as though you could not
stand life another minute, and it is these troubles that bring on the nerv-
ousness.
Since nervousness can be traced to a definite cause, therefore, it is the
duty of every woman to overcome it. For thirty years women who are
nervous have been cured by Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. It
Is the best remedy known for nervous women, or for those suffering from
any disorder of the feminine organs. This fact is proven again and again
by letters from thousands of women, who write to Mrs. Pinkham, at Lynn,
Mass., and thank her for the cure accomplished in them. Backache, pain
in the sides, bearing down pains, headaches, nervousness, all are sure in-
dications of trouble in the feminine organs. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound cures them all. Unnatural discharges are stopped, the inflamma-
tion is overcome and the various organs restored to a normal condition.
"With renewed health the pains leave and the nervousness is gone.

For the week ending February 2. 1001. loans

There' can be no doubt that the present loan
expansion represents In part the transfer or

ure of the stock market to-day. Consols were
firm on continental buying. American shares
were as dull as ditch water, with prices most
ly under parity, owing to some sales against
options and realizations on fears that the
statement of the New York Associated Banks
would make a poor showing.
Copper shares were irregular; Rio Tintos
selling at 45V4 and Anaconda at 7%.
Discount rates are hardening and the mar
ket is still depending on the Bank of England

NEW YORK, Feb. 8.â Although there was

vantage ground. The tarn, however, seemed
to be ln favor of buyers and it was probable
that lower prices would have to be accepted
In order to place- large lots. Meanwhile prices
stand Â¦ on about the same basis quoted yester
day, as follows:
Lake, spot, 12%Â«()13c; electrolytic, 12%@

for tin was about steady, but very quiet, with
spot quoted at $24 25@24 75. Tinplates were

The Financier says: This week's statement
of the New York Associated Banks showed a
net loss of $2,557,900 in casn, exceeding the
estimates by $1,790,801. There was a gain
of $233,500 In specie, while legal tenders fell
off $2,779,400. It 6eems quite probable that
the decrease in the items of legal . tenders wes
due In great part to paynfents into the treas
ury of these notes by banks retiring circula
tion. Such payments by interior institutions
were made through their New York correspond
ents. The movementof currency to Boston and
Philadelphia during the week most likely con
tributed to the loss of legal tenders by the
banks. The striking feature of the statement
was the Increase of $28,974,300 in loans, mak
ing an increase in this Item since the beginning
of the year $00,545,800. This increase could
scarcely have been wholly due to borrowings on
time by commission houses and it was probab
ly largely the result of loaning to syndicates
who had paid off their foreign loans and had
made contracts with local Institutions. The
gain In loans was reflected In an expansion in
deposits slightly beyond the billion dollar mark,
the increase of $24,684,000 in this Item last
week carrying the total to $1,000,081,900, which
it may be noted is $6,088,000 more than the de
posits at the corresponding date last year and
S11.S32.100 below the largest deposits on
record, $1,012,514,000. March 2, 1901. The sur
plus reserve was reduced by $8,727,125 because
of the Increased reserve requirements and the
loss of cash, and the surplus now stands at
$17,696,225, against $20,362,625 at the cor
responding date a year ago. The statement is
slightly out of harmonyp the gain in deposits
exceeding by $1,733,500 the Increase In loans
less loss of cash. Eight of the larger banks
showed a gain in loans of $28,200,000. Four of
these Institutions which are mosf intimately
connected with Wall street operations showed
an increase in loans of $20,000,000 out of the
$26 200,000 above noted. Four down town
banks reported an increase of $10,000,000 in
specie and six banks showed a decrease 'of
$9 300,000 in this item, making the "net gain
by these ten Institutions $700,000.
Reserves required, $250,170,475; increase,
$6,171,220.
Surplus, $17,896,225; decrease. $8,727,125.

Prices for everything under this head remain
the same. Stocks of both Butter and Egga con
tinue light, and though receipts of Egga are
now running large they seem to clean up. as
the public are using many more now that the
retail price has got down to 25c for the best
ranch. It Is no trouble to get full figures for
Butter, owing to the moderate stocks, and
Cheese is quoted steady. At the same time,
a continuation, of the present soft moist weather
will probably break both Butter and Eggs in a
few days.
Receipts were 27,300 pounds, 12 tubs and
kegs of Butter. pounds of Eastern Butter,
1003 cases of Eggs, cases of Eastern Eggs.
7.100 pounds of California Cheese. pounds

"In prunes a fair jobbing trade continues to
be noted, with sales of occasional car lots for
forward delivery from the coast. Spot on fine
new Santa Clara fruit is steady around 6%c
to 6%c for 40-5OS in 25-lb boxes. Stocks of
Santa Claras are reported not to exceed seven
ty-five carloads on the coast for new and
about 100 cars of old. New offer on the 3Vic
four sire basis, with possible purchases at
some ehadlng. Oregon prunes are steady. In
aprlcotx and peaches more trading on the spot
is in order, and some firmness is noted. Dates
are in moderate request for Persians, but no
change is noted in sellers' views. Kards are
quiet. Figs chow firmness with occasional
business. In nuts cpot Tarragona almonds are
easier with offerings at lie. Filberts are also
easier. A exposition to firmness is noted in
Valencia shelled almonds, one holder quoting
23?ic for epot." T
"In raisins, which etill furnish the chief In
terest, there Is considerable firmness to note
among- holders on the spot, but no important
trading. Some Irregularity is noted in the
views cf sellers with choice eeefied in 1-lb
carton* available at 8&c and fancy at &\ic
Most holders, however, quote S%o to 8%c for
chcioe and 6Â»ic for fancy. A moderate Jobbing
business is doing on the quoted basis, but no
l&r^e lots are being moved, the policy of sell
ers being conservative. The position for spot
is strong with a higher tendency. On<he new
coast basis a few round lots have been sold
for delivery from the coast to Western points,
but little if any buying has been done for de
livery here. Cost to lay down here on seeded
1-lb cartons at the new values Is around 9%c
and until spot advances to about this figure no
extended business for delivery here Is probable.
Spot loose is 6trong and not offered freely. In
Valencia layer raisins the market shows a
somewhat easier tone. Goods to arrive ex-
Ontaneda now due offer ex-dock at 7 Vic. The
Â¦vessel has around 15,000 boxes. In currants a
little inquiry is reported from the Interior for
uncleased in barrels, but buyers' Ideas appear
etill below the views of sellers. The market
is steady at from 5 9-16c to 5%c for fine
AmaJia grade. Cartons are showing a moder
ate Jobbing interest within the Quoted ranee
according to seller and quality. The Greek
market is reported strong.

obligations from foreign lenders incurred dur
ing the financial activities of last year to
domestic lenders. That is to say, funds bor
rowed from New York banks are used to pay
off debts to foreigners by the export of gold
But there is a conviction general in Wall
street that large loans are being secured by
syndicates for carrying out new projects. The
features of to-day's market was the notable
buying movement In Reading, active selling of
Manhattan, strength in Metropolitan and i
eharp recovery from an early decline In Amal
gamated Copper. General Electric Jumped S%
and reacted 1%. A number of minor railroad
stocks showed etrength.
The large speculative interests in the mar
ket have made determined efforts all week to
start the market and have met with meas
urable success, in spite of the checks received
from several of the week's developments..
There is no evidence of a large participation
in the market by the general public, but It
is Invariably the rule that the public await*
the initiative of the professionals and refrains
from speculation, no matter how encouraging
the general conditions,; until prices advance,
he professional element In the market has
become impressed with the Idea that consider
able sums have been husbanded to an extent
lat will warrant an upward movement, and
they have been busy with manipulative de
vices to inaugurate the upward movement.
After working 6UcceBSfully for half a day on
Monday they were met with the postponement
>y the Supreme Court of the expected decision
in the Northern Securities case. The morn
ing's gains melted away in a few minutes.
On Tuesday the announcement of . heavy en-
E&grements of sold for export on Thursday had
the same effect. These setbacks proved to be
temporary and the market broadened and
gained considerable activity and strength later
in the week. A feature of the' week has been
the sensational advance in many of the high
grade dividend-paying railroad stocks. Much
wae hoped by the bulls from a decision in
the Northern Securities case, as the uncertainty
of that case is believed to be the principal re
straining Influence on speculative activity. It
was feared the postponement of the decision
for three weeks would keep the market dull
and indifferent, but the uncertainty has been
made to serve a speculative purpose and has
given opportunity for the circulation of many
rumors, which have helped the advance in
stocks. The project for the formation of a
company to control the Metropolitan Street
Railway Company is the latest instance and
has given rise to the supposition that the ulti
mate control of all the Greater New York
transit facilities was in contemplation. Re
newed attention is called to the enormous
amount of capital tied up in last year's strug
gle for control of the Northwestern railroads
and other corporations by the present conditions
in the international exchange market and by
a study of the annual reports In detail of the
New York trust companies. The present ex
port movement of gold is clearly for the pay
ment of foreign obligations which are be
lieved to have been Incurred last spring dur
ng the Northern Pacific struggle. These hav=
been partly renewed from time to time as
the resources of the foreign exchange market
allowed and have partly been paid off by the
gold export movement in the fall. The pres
ent ease of the local money market seems to
be thÂ« inducement for paying- them off at this
time as they mature. But the course of the
loan account of the clearing house banks war
rants the supposition that loans are made In
the local market to meet the foreign obliga
tions, thus transferring the credits from for
eign lenders to domestic. The domestic rail
road condition seems to continue highly pros
perous, as shown by the continued high level
of gross earnings reported from week to week,
while the net returns for December of corn
carrying roads show that the shortage In that
traffic has been more than offset by growth
In general traffic. The demand for all grades
of iron and its products into the second half
of the year is reported in excess of the do
mestic power of production and imports are
In contemplation to meet our demand. The
improved demand for copper, both domestic
and foreign. Is a relief to apprehension In re
pard to that trade. Meantime money con
tinues easy and in apparently abundant sun
ply, notwithstanding the gold exports and the
subscriptions for various new bond issues of
railroads, designed to Increase facilities or to
secure additional lines.
There has been a large business In bonds
and some notable gains in prices.

CHICAGO, Feb. 8. â The narrow up and
down market in wheat that has characterized
speculation In that cereal for some time past
began again to-day at the opening. Wheat had
to defend itself from the depression of lower

made itself manifest. Weather conditions were
also against the bulls and at the start St. Louis

opened %@Uc lower at 7"V4@77%c to 77%@
77%c, but at once began to show. signs of
strength. Commission houses had some orders
late, shorts covering" and the crowd began to
buy. May soon touched 78c, but on recurrent
weakness In the coarse grains eased oft at
times. At the close, however. May was firm,
%c up, at 77%@7Sc.
Corn again led In the decline which opened
business to-day and its recovery was slow and
labored. The local pit was crowded the early

WHEAT The ! week closed on dull markets
all over the world, with lower Paris and Liv
erpool futures. v : _.,
Chicago declined from 77%c to 77%o and
recovered to 78c. The market was -dull, but
there were more buyers than sellers. The
market appeared locally oversold, but consid
erable off-grade wheat has lately been worked
and lighter receipts are beginning to attract
attention. Â» Cars from the Northwest <*Â«*?Â«
the week numbered 1600. against 2500 for the
same week last year. The leaders bought on
an anticipated decrease in the visible supply.
Stocks at Minneapolis decreased 385,783 bush
els during the week. A bear raid on corn
had a tendency to weaken everything, but
wheat yielded stubbornly and very little came
out.
- It is an old saying that one has to go away
from home to learn the news. During the past
week this market has been quoted dull by lead
ing operators, but private wires from Chicago
say that the cash demand at San Francisco has
been the heaviest ever known, and yesterday
this news was confirmed by San Francisco par
ties. This heavy demand is said to be on
shipping account, but prices remain the same
all around. - . - '

George Stevenson Dies From His In-
GBOGAN MAY HAVE TO
ANSWER. FOR MURDER
s At the age of 45 years, a stalwart man,
of apparently strong constitution, has
passed away, and a wide circle of warm
friends mourns the loss of George M. lion
ergan. The cause of death was pneumo
nia.
For twenty-seven years Mr. Lonergan
has been in business in San Francisco,
and will long be remembered for his ge
nial disposition. Despite the responsibili
ties of the large business he managed,
care nor worry did not burden hlg life.
At an early age he married, and four
children, three boys and one daughter
survive him. His wife died fourteen years
ago. He was a loving, devoted father
caring tenderly for his . little brood of
motherless children.
He found a friend indeed in the person
of Mrs. George B. Homer, with whom he
has made his home for the past fourteen
years. She reared three of Mr. Loner
?? n ' s l 5?i ldrel ] 11 ? her own - Another of
the children is being raised in the home
of Mr. Richard Sealy of Alameda,
Mr. Lonergan was a member of Iena
tian Council No. 35, Young Men's Insti
tute, and a devout member of the church
His mother, at the age of 97. still lives at
North Adams, Mass., hio birthplace,
where also reside a brother and two sis
ters. The other brothers reside in Phila
delphia, where they are engaged Jn the
brass foundry business. â¢
. In 1885-he became a member of the firm
of Goldberg, Bowen & Co., and for the
past ten years he has managed the Butter
street Btore of that firm. His son Pierce
who has been in the same store for some
years, will now represent his father's in
terest.
To show due respect to Mr. Lonergan
the Sutter street store will close from 9
a. m. to 12 m. Monday.
The funeral" procession will leave the
undertaking parlors, 29 Van Ness avenue
at 9:30 o'clock, and a solemn high mass
will be celebrated at St. Mary's Cathe
dral, 'Van Ness avenue and O'Farrell
street, at 10 o'clock Monday moraine 'The
celebrant will be Vicar General the Ver^
Rev. John J. Frendergast, assisted by
Rev. . Father Dempsey and Rev. . Father
Ramra. The manager of ceremonies. will
be Rev. Father D. O. Crowley Â¦
Interment will be beside his'wife in St.
Mary's Cemetery. Oakland. â¢ , "
George M. Lonergan.
The match was close and Interesting,
being decided by the last two couples on
the teams. The first six players on the
Oakland team scored 19 up against their
opponents, the number required to wipe
off Ean Francisco's lead of 18 on the Pre
sidio links and leave Oakland a winner, 1
up. Had the last two men in the Oak
land team been able to play "all square"
with their opponents Oakland would have
won the match. But Captain S. L. Ab
bot Jr. of San Francisco had placed L.
O. Kellogg and H. C. Golcher at the bot
tom of his team in order that they might
score against the two last men of the
Adams Point eight. His arrangement of
his team was justified by the results. The
full details are shown in the table:
The first home-and-home golf match of
the season over thirty-six holes between
teams representing the Oakland and the
San Francisco Golf clubs was concluded
yesterday on the Adams Point links, the
San Francisco eight winning 7 up.
Collins, who Â¦ lives, at 132 Erie street,
says he was on his way home from work
about 2 o'clock yesterday morning and
while walking along Eleventh -street, be'
tween Bryant and Harrison, the two foot
pads called upon him to stop. The col
ored man grabbed him by the throat,
telling him not to make a noise, and the
other went through f his pockets, but
found nothing worth taking. He was
then told to go ahead and keep his mouth
shut. The robbers did not display any
weapon. Collins was able to give a good
description of them.
The police were . notified yesterday
morning by Dr. G. W. Leek, 756 Golden
Gate avenue, that his residence had been
entered by burglars between 10 and 11
o'clock Friday night and a sealskin coat,
money and jewelry to the value of about
$500 stolen. Detectives Harper and Arm
strong have been detailed on the case.
Â¦A- window in an alley that runs past
the house had been left partly open from
the bottom and It was a simple matter
for the burglars to crawl through the
open window, and secure. their plunder.
Joseph Collins, fireman In thÂ© Market
street Railway's power-house at Eleventh
and, Bryant streets, reported to the po
lice yesterday that he had been held up
by two men, one being a colored man..

Receipts of Produce.
To-day this county has an area of but 8000
square miles, but it is all picked ground. It
has not a square mile, from border to border
in which either the precious minerals or the
industrial minerals cannot be found. Geolo
gists are all agreed that a mineral belt fifty to
a hundred miles In width extends through Ari
zona* from northwest to southeast. It can be
plainly traced from the extreme northwest cor
ner of Mohave County to the extreme southeast
corner of Cochlse. But there are also unmis
takable evidences of a second belt that extends
northeast and southwest, from the northeast
corner of Coconino County to the southwest
corner of Tuma County. Imagine two ropes
crossing each other diagonally and knotted at
their junction and you have the mineral system
of the country. The "Bra'dshaw Mountain sys
tem, which includes the entire group of moun
tains lying between the Hassayampa and the
Agua Frla rivers, and between Prescott and the
southern plains â this almost circular group of
granite peaks and ridges â is the knot that
unites the two mineral ropes above mentioned
The Prescott Prospect has Issued a spe
cial mining edition for Yavapai County,
Arizona. Among its statements of gen
eral Interest are the following:
Arizona's Mineral Belt.
Going easterly along the lode It is owned by
the following companies, respectively: The
Alaska United Gold Mining Company, 750 feet;
Alaska-Mexican Gold Mining Company, 2700
feet. Some 2250 feet between the Mexican and
the eastern end of the Golden Chariot claim is
in litigation, and the title is undetermined.
The Ready Bullion Gold Mining Company owns
800 feet and the Alaska Atlin Mining Company
owns 5500 feet of the lode. The lode has not
been traced with much certainty from the
Treadwell workings in a westerly direction,
though some mining men think that it is pos
sible to do so, while others are equally positive
that It does not exist much If any distance be
yond the westerly end line of the Treadwell or
Paris claim. Those who contend that the lode
does not cut off atthe westerly end of the rfo
called "Glory Hole" claim that it extends from
the northwesterly angle of the Glory Hole in a
northwesterly direction to the beach of Gas
tineaux Channel, and that the croppings may
be traced under the old Bear's Nest mill. . So
far as we are able to learn, however, these
opinions are based merely on casual observa
tions and not upon investigation sufficient to
thoroughly Justify an intelligent opinion.
According to the Juneau Dispatch the
Alaska Atlin Company now controls all
claims on the extension of the famous
Treadwell lode, on Douglas Island, from
the Ready Bullion claim to a point on
Bullion Creek, a distance of about 5500
feet. The superintendent of the Alaska
Atlin Company believes that he has traced
the Treadwell lode in a southeasterly di
rection for a distance of nearly two and
a half miles. Of the 13,000 feet now trace
able the Alaska Treadwell Gold Mining
Company owns 1000 feet. The Dispatch
says:
Tracing Tread-well Lode.
The Redding Free Press reports that
the Iron Mountain mine is gradually cool-
Ing off after the fire in it. If a heavy
rain should come to swell the creek it
would be â¢ easy to flood the mine. The
company is going to tap the ore in a
number of new places. In a short time
operations will be conducted on as large
a scale as ever.
Work on the Eclipse mine, on Gold
Flat, Nevada County, according to the
Nevada City Transcript, is progressing
well. The Posey mine, in Willow Valley,
has struck a good ledge. The Niagara
mine, in the Willow Valley district, has
been bonded to San Francisco parties.
The Delhi ! mine, at Columbia Hill, has
been compelled to shut down by the freez
ing of the ditches.

In the last budget the sum of $16,000 was
set aside for the payment of such fees for
the present fiscal year. No appropriation
was made to pay fees to grand jurors, but
the sum of $1500 was provided to pay ac
tual expenses incurred by the Grand Jury.
Only $570 of this money was utilized to
pay a stenographer and for other inciden-i
tal expenses. Although there is a balance
of $930 in the fund Baehr declares that the
grand Jurors have not a foot to stand on
in their endeavor to exact pay for their
services from the municipality.
The names of the grand jurors who have
filed claims, which vary according to the
number of days actually served, are:
Notwithstanding this formidable array
of signatures Auditor Baehr refused to
audit the demands on* the ground that
there is no law providing for per diem,
pay to the grand jurors. Baehr is of the
opinion that the demands were presented
under an amended act of the last Legis
lature, section 1143 of which provides that
the fees of Jurors in the Superior Courts
of the State in criminal cases shall be $2
for each day's attendance. Â¦/ .
The last Grand Jury, of which Frank J.
Symm.es was foreman, presented demands
yesterday to Auditor Baehr covering
charges for their services at the rate of
$2, per diem. The demands aggregate
$1298. and were signed by Carroll Cook as
presiding Judge of the Superior Court.
They were also Indorsed as correct by Al
bert B. Mahony, County Clerk, and by J.
J. Grelf, chief register clerk.
At the Eykes mine the. new ditch has been
completed and everything is- ready for the
spring run. Last fall the company had a good
run from the fall rains. At Minersvllle a force
of men are at work running tunnels and devel
oping the Fairview mines, now under bond to
the Altoona Company.- The work shows up a
good property and there is hardly any doubt
but that the company will take it On Coffee
Creek a force of sixty men are employed at the
famous Dorleska mine developing the property
and getting out quartz. From < all indications
times will be good about the Center the coming
season. The wagon road â¢ from Elatonls will
probably come to the Center and quarts mines
will undoubtedly be developed on a large scale.
The Trinity Journal says, that a' group

Several deals of interest are reported by
the Los Angeles Mining Review to have
taken place recently In the Panamint dis
trict, in Inyo County. The Anthony
group of gold mines, near Ballarat, has
been purchased by Boston parties for $50,
000. The mines will be worked by the
Mineral Ranch Gold Company. At Old
Panamint Tracy M. Stebbins is working
some of the old mines with a new pro
cess.
The Redding Free Press reports the fol
lowing:
The Truckee Republican says that twen
ty additional stamps will be installed at
the old Hartley mine. In the Meadow
Lake district if developments continue on
the present basis. The Champion Gold
Mining Company has been reorganized.
Kmil R. Abadie has been elected super
intendent of the mine, vice Fred Zeitler,
resigned. > . -Â¦
Some owners have gone wild over a few
pounds of rich surface rock or some resem
blance in the character of the vein or country
rock to a known rich mine and the crlce has
become prohibitive. Such prospectors are a
great drawback to any mining district. Bet
ter to give away a prospect to a party - that
would develop It than hold It tied up at a
prohibitive price. One mine developed In a
district Increases the value of all others. We
recall several promising prospects In this coun
ty where the high price demanded has dis
couraged sale and the mines stand to-day just
as they were ten or twenty years ago. No
one has received any benefit from them and
no one knows yet whether they are worth any
thing or not. Had the owner accepted an
offer of five or six thousand dollars, a big
return for his expenditure, he would have been
that much ahead at least and probably the
mine would have been opened.
The Calaveras Prospect says that there
are probably fifty good mining properties
In Calaveras County that if sold for a
few thousand dollars each would be de
veloped. On this basis the Prospect has
the following general remarks -to make
about the policy of keeping mines tied up:
Properties Are Tied "Op.
Never In the history of Nevada City has
there been such a demand for our mines by
moneyed mining men as at the ~ present' time.
It would seem that the minds of prominent
capitalists are concentrated upon this section.
More claims have been bonded within the past
few months than at any time during any ten
years' period since the discovery of our val
uable mines, and it Is probable that ! many
more undeveloped claims will be taken up by
capitalists before the summer season opens, as
the demand for Nevada County * properties
seems to be Increasing every day. If the de
mand for mines is so great at this season of
the year what can we expect when spring
opens? Surely the future outlook for this min
ing district is very bright and Â¦ promising and
it is certain that the hard-time cranks as well
as the "knockers" will soon have .to "go
'way back and sit down" for the rest of their
days.
The following account of the outlook
for mining in Nevada County is given by
the Nevada City Transcript:
The San Bernardino Sun says that C. B.
Eaton and his wife, who have been work-
Ing on the Capitol mine at Dale, San Ber
nardino County, have struck a ledge 100
feet wide that averages. $30 rock. Some
streaks through the ledge are fabulously
rich, actually assaying $137,000 to the ton!
The Placerville Nugget reports that a
good ledge has been struck at the Monte
zuma mine, near Nashville. The Union
mine, near El Dorado, will be started up
soon. Arrangements have been made to
work from the Church mine to the Union
and drifting has begun on the lower level
toward the Union mine. The River Hill
mine had a break in its ditch and Is run
ning with a small force of men. . . .
"Work has been resumed on the Walling
and Muller mine In Woods Ravine, near
Nevada City, eo says the Nevada City
Transcript.' The company is composed of
practical miners. ' ,

Some Inquiry having; been made con
cerning the exact text of the bill Intro
duced in Congress by Congressman Woods
of this State for the creation of an execu
tive department to be known as the De
partment of Mines and Mining, the sub
ject Is once more reviewed briefly for the
benefit of those principally concerned.
The head of the department, a. member
of the Cabinet, so the bill provides, shall
be appointed by the President. The sal
ary for the Secretary of Mines and Mining
is fixed at SSOOO and his assistant will have
$4000 per Â¦annum- A chief clerk at $1800 per
annum Is also provided for, together with
other clerical assistance that may be re
quired. The following are the two sec
tions of leading Importance:
Jewett & Blodgett are experimenting at their
Sunset refinery to ascertain the. valuable prop
erties of the oil of that field in addition to
tls use as fuel and for the manufacture of
asphalt. . A practical scientist has been . Im
ported from the East and he has discovered
that the distillate by the run through
the still yielded three excellent lubricants. The
first is a heavy green engine oil; the second,
lemon-colored cun oil, and the third an axle
grease that is white when first run out, turn
ins; a deep red on exposure to the air. Satis
factory tests have been 'made of the utility
of each of these products and samples are be
ing sent out for reports of their value when
put to actual test.
Th Los Angeles Herald says
- The fact that the Standard Oil Company
is prepared to expend $30,000,000 in the "de
velopment of Texas and California oil in
terests, as reported, is a sufficient indica
tion of the belief on the part of experts
In the permanency of petroleum in the
new fields.. Fleets of vessels and pipe lines
are to be constructed, together with the
new refinery at Point Richmond.- . -
The New Hope Company, which : has
been drilling about three years north of
Poso Creek, in Kern County, has finally
abandoned the attempt to strike oil at
that place. The greatest depth the com
pany reached was 1100 feet. :
The January shipments from the McKit
trick-field amounted to about 30,000 bar
rels. â¢ Â¦ .- - .

A block of 2000 shares of the stock of the
Union Oil Company was recently sold at
Los Angeles at the reported price of $60
per share.
March 15 is fixed as the day for begin
ning to lay the pipe line of the Standard
Oil Company from Bakersfield to Point
Richmond. The announcement that this
line would be constructed was originally
made in The Call some months ago. At
that time the plans of the company were
very well covered. . The entire right of
way has been obtained, so the officials of
the Standard Oil Company report. The
line will be about 300 miles long. The pipe
will be eight inches in diameter. The ..oil
will be propelled over tracts where there
is little natural fall by the aid of pump-
Ing plants. Work on the refinery at Point
Richmond is making good progress. A
wharf is being constructed which will be
1300 feet long. ,

The companies that Young has Invited
to attend the meeting to form a clearing
house are the following:
Companies Are Invited.
The efforts of the Kern County parties
who are outside of the combine to form
a clearing-house are attracting' consider
able attention. In a circular recently is
sued, In which oil men were Invited to at
tend a meeting, C. E. Young, secretary of
the Bakersfleld Oil Stock Exchange,
makes the statement that outside of the
production controlled by the Associated
Oil Company and by, the companies that
have not joined with the Associated Oil
combine there are still estimated to: be
3,015,800 barrels of annual' production not
provided for. .
The situation is improved from the mar
keting point of view. 'In the month of
January, according to the figures com
piled by the Los Angeles Herald's statis
tician, there were no apparent changes in
the production south of Tehachapi, al
though some excellent wells were brought
Into the field. In the Kern River district
only seven new wells were made produc
tive in January, as against thirty-nine In
December. ..
. The oil production of California is not
a criterion of the prosperity of the oil in
dustry for the present. The efforts of the
Associated Oil Company are mainly di
rected to stiffening the price. Consequent
ly that great corporation is not trying to
push the production very fast. That has
an- effect upon the showing in the Kefn
River district, which is the chosen field of
the Associated Oil Company for its initial
efforts. The prices for oil are better.

Harrison's circular says;. "Since the Ven
tura sailed the following cargoes of Australian
coal have been delivered' here, viz.: Chilton
ford, 3778 tons; Drummulr, 2767 tons; Gleno
gil. 3500 tons; Klnroshire. 3710 tons; Drum
cralg 2323 tons; M. P. Grace, 2300 tons; total.
18,378 tons. There are twenty-six vessels on
the chartered list to bring 78,000 tons of Co
lonial coal; of these there are nine which should
arrive here this month. â¢ The Â¦, latest cabled
freight rates on' coal from Newcastle show a
further â¢ decline, which ' enables importers to
name a comparatively low price for future de
livery, still at the decline consumers are not
eager buyers. ; Sales of < fuel for steam use*
are diminishing weekly, as they are gradually
drifting into the consumption of fuel oil as a
substitute, â¢ principally because of its efficiency
and economy. â¢ When an equal amount of ener
gy can be produced by the expenditure of $3 0O
for Oil, which would require $6 for coal. It 1Â»
a foregone conclusion which the buyers will se
lect. The coast products are also being offered
at low -figures to meet the market. There has
been a very liberal demand In the past two
months for house coals, occasioned by the ex
tremely, cold weather. The seasonal rainfall
for the past few days may cause an advance in
outward I freight rates on grain ; if / this hap
pens we may look for coal freights to further
decline from 'Australia, although 10s per ton.
