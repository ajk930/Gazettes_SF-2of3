JOHN J. DEANE
ON THE STAND
THE investigation by Mayor
Schmitz yesterday of the Ma
hony scandal was conducted in
open session and the evidence
adduced- completed the discom
fiture of the County Clerk. The
hearing was concluded before. 5 o'clock
and the Mayor announced that he would
take the matter under consideration. In
answer to a question by Attorney Rior
dan, Mahony's counsel, the Mayor said he
would let the accused know when he was
ready to give his decision.
Five witnesses who had seen the con-
tract in which Mahony agreed to take
care of Deane and his friends gave their
testimony. The former County Clerk told
a straightforward story of the circum
stances that led to the drawing up and
signing of the contract. Mrs. Deane tes
tified to having the contract for months
in her custody. John Dearie, brother!, of
the. former County Clerk, had read 'Â¦Â¦ the
document and he told, on the stand
what were its contents and what
signatures . were attached. Joseph
Leggett testified to the signatures and to
part ' of the contents. And ' most conclu-

The wife of the: recent County Clerk
had been asked. where, the, contract -was

sive of all, John 'C. Flood, the deputy in

I think it is a duty I owe, not only to my
self, but to the people of the city and

of supervision over all officers, to Inquire

"I desire, however, since the news

Clerk Is a county officer and the Mayor

the Mayor's power to suspension is solely
confined to malfeasance or misconduct In

The Ban Righ was built at Glasgow in

-Â» yr AY OR SCHMITZ has now under advisement the evidence which
\/l supports the grave accusations which this paper has made against
J. VJL County Clerk Mahony. The testimony, overwhelming in its charac
ter, has been presented to tlte chief executive of this city, and one
of the most serious issues which he probably will be called upon to determine
during his term as chief magistrate of San Fraiurisco is before him. The in
quiry resulting from the charge made by The Call that County Clerk Mahony
violated tlie laws of the State and of the municipality in signing a secret, un
lawful, criminal, ante-election compact is over, and the duty of The Call
is ended.
This paper performed the painful duty of exposing a crime, and the re
sponsibility of punishing the perpetrator of that crime, under the law, rests
with Mayor Schmits as far as he has power to act. The investigation was
concluded yesterday, and County Clerk Mahony stands now under the blaze
of exposure, as a man who is not only ready to commit a felony but to lie'
and to shrink behind his friends in order to evade the consequences of his
criminality.
The testimony submitted to Mayor Schmitz yesterday showed beyond: cttz
shadow of doubt that the criminal ante-election compact to reivavd W. A. p
Deane in consideration for his retirement from the race for the nomination for Â¦'
County Clerk was signed by Mahony. Stenographer John C. Flopdj^recante~cÂ£*z
his former testimony and admitted that he zurote.the, compact, W. A. Qeane ; '/
testified that he sazu it signed, and as a startling climax to the whole disgrace^
ful affair, one zvitness made confession that the incriminating document, which '
'under the law deprives County Clerk .Mahony of his \ position of trust, was
burned yesterday afternoon. ',..Â¦_ /: â¢
, Only one person soughf to. hide from the truth. While not under oath,
County Clerk Mahony denied that lie had- ever signed tlie agreement, and in
that denial gave voice to a lie: When asked to place himself tinder oath and
submit to the added danger of committing perjury, he refused to take the wit
ness-stand. He remains therefore before the people of this city in a light most
shameful. The position which he occupies involves,' the presumption that he
must be a man of the most scrupulous integrity, absolutely abo-ve. suspicion and
uncompromising in his just treatment of persons and affairs. He has in his
tiistody documents of incalculable value.
.':/,' He is called upon to perform a sacred duty of draiving juries, which may
'affect the life and even the death of the people of San Francisco. He has in his
custody documents zuhich determine the possession of property, and in the daily
routine of his office lie is called upon to exercise the most exacting care and
'judgment to conserve the rigltts and liberties of the people of San Francisco.
This is what he' must be to fulfill rightly the obligations of the post to which
the electors of San Francisco have elevated him.
Â¦ And at the very beginning of his public career he convicts himself >. as a
liar, a signer of a criminal compact, the perpetrator of a felony and a man to
whom no confidence can be given. The inquiry which has followed the expose
of The Call has developed these very serious facts. Mayor Schmitz has seen
n't to record his own opinion that if the charges of The Call are sustained by
ihc evidence he ivould in himself be derelict in his duty if he did not take sum
mary action to protect San Francisco from the danger which now confronts
it in the -.County Clerk's office. The issue is in the hands of the Mayor.

Raker became very noisy at times, en
tering exceptions and making objection
able remarks to the court and gentlemen
of the prosecution. At one stage in the
proceedings the court accused Spencer of
trying to make the tell a false
hood and that he firamed questions with
no other purpose. Both Raker and Spen
cer protested and the court' said: Â¦
"Is it what you eater drink, or Is'it
the. ozone, that you imbibe, or what is It
that causes you to bring about a squabble
every night just before adjournment? You
are bitter, malicious and willful, and I am
heartily . sick of it. Adjourn court until
to-morrow, and I want to again say.to, the
jury that I hope- in the name of God they
never have to pass through such ah ordeal
again, or me either." f
: Spencer took up Morris' direct examina
tion, questioning him regarding his move
ments on tho night of- May 30, but the
cross-examination did not elicit any ma
terial difference in the' witness' testimony
about that occasion. On several occasions
Spencer seemed to be playing on the
witness* knowledge of English, and Gen
eral Post entered several protests when it
came to- the witness' identification of "the
country party" at the schoolhouse. Spen
cer went over the ground already gone
over, but the witness could not be shaken
saying he identilied the party by their
familiar appearance, pose, -face and" such
knowledge as he gained by long Intimate
acquaintance. - , .-. - - â¢Â¦...-
Raker interrupted and the court told
him tp "shut up." This was the first
storm of the afternoon session and it was

jection of .the prosecution. The court
said, however, that Morris could, if he
liked, tell what his conversation was on
tl*t occasion. General Post Jumped to
his feet and said: "I would like toâ"
their friendly ' relations.
,'lne Eart-of. Lytton;who seconded the
motion, congratulated the Government on
their "more than* friendly relations with
.the. United States and the South American
republics." H e added that though affairs
in Ireland' were considered critical they
.might safely be' left in'the hands of the
Government. 1 ' tf{
; Earl Spencer (Liberal), criticizing the
address, said that while he recognized the
impossibility of ; granting the Boer de
mands for. Independence he deprecated In
sistence on unconditional surrender. His
lordship urged' the. Government to prom
ise the Boers autonomy similar to that
possessed by the governments of Aus
gtralia. and Canada.
-' The. Premier. Lord Salisbury, whose en
trance into the; house was greeted with,
hearty applause; said he was glad to hear
Earl Spencer vent an utterance for which
he.. the Premier, had been frequently and
unsparingly condemned. It was quite true
that there was no possibility of granting
the Boers independence. Neither was.it
the Government's business, after being
gratuitously to â¢ inform the
Boers on what terms, they would be for
given, especially since the Boers had not
Â¦ yet expressed a wish to be forgiven.
.-.Lord Salisbury â¢ continued by defending
martial law in South Africa and urged the
oppisition to remember that they were ntÂ»t

Replying to the, Ptemier: Lord Rosebery

Morris stated that he and Raker had a
conversation at Orion Trowbridge's store
at Bieber and that he "might" have made
a short statement to the same effect.'
Asked If he had made a similar statement

Spencei*:sa4djherwould endeavor to pro

universal practice of all . countries. .'- He
also said that the Government of Cape

Raker stated that Jim Brown, the de
fendant, had employed him and that

satisfaction of his â¢ Majesty, but to the

Next followed reference to the Anglo-
Prazilian treaty, to the referring of the
British Guiana-Brazil boundary ques
tions to the arbitration of the King of
Italy,- to the necessity for the continuance
of famine relief measures in India; and to
the death of the Ameer, '.'whose son,, Ha

I trust its deciEion may lead to the

"I have concluded with the President of
the United States a treaty, the provi
sions of which will facilitate the con
struction of an interoceanic canal under
guarantee that its neutrality will be
maintained, and that it will be open to
the commerce and shipping of all na

Regrets the War Is Still On.
"I regret," said his Majesty, "that the
.war in South Africa is not yet concluded,
though the course of the operation's has
"been favorable . to our arms, the area of
war largely reduced , and industries are
being resumed in my new colonies. In
,splte of the tedious character of the cam
paign, my soldiers throughout have dis
played a cheerfulness in the endurance of
the hardships incident to guerrilla warfare
and a humanity, even to their own detri
ment, in their treatment of the enemy
which are deserving of the highest praise
The necessity for relieving those or my
troops who have most felt the strain of
Â¦war has afforded me the opportunity of
again availing myself of" tne" loyal and
patriotic offers of my colonies, and fur
ther contingents will shortly reach South

In regard to the sugar conferenc2 the
speech says:

Miss Burt insisted on finishing her term.
No direct charge was made against her,
at least publicly, and Doub, who returned
from McKittrick, stated that the matter
had been satisfactorily, -arranged 'and
that Miss Burt would resume her duties
next Monday. Some say her dismissal
was the result of a factional . fight, while
others hint at gossip which proves to
have been without foundation. One fist
fight has, already resulted, -one of Miss
Burt's many champions, whose. wife is a
friend of the troubled . teacher, having; it
Is said, knocked down. a man who made
a disparaging remark - concerning Miss
Burt. 'Â¦Â¦Â¦' ; ' .-
Then the trouble started, but the young
lady, nothing daunted, went gayly on
Tuesday to the schoolhouse, which':. had
been locked, and after climbing through
the window, which she pried open, sat
ready for business. Wednesday the
schoolhouse was tightly closed, and, ow
ing to the trustees' inabi'ity to handle the
Eroblem, County Superintendent of
chools Doub went to the scene to take
a hand.
According to a report from McKittrlck
Miss Burt's troubles commenced' just as
she was stepping aboard a train to go to
San Francisco to visit her relatives dur
ing the recent holidays. At. that time
she was notified in writing .that, she was
dismissed. She sent back word, it is
said, to the school trustees, TV. Roclgers,
president; George C. Troth and H. F.
Peters, that she would be on hand to .'re
open her school, trustees or no trustees.
True to her promise she arrived in Mc-
Kittrick and took her seat at her school
desk last Monday. ; â¢ Â¦
The young lady for the past two days
has kept the trustees of the school very
busy in their efforts to prevent her from
teaching her classes, despite the fact that
she was notified that her services would
be no longer required. She was employed,
however, for the term of eight months,
and she Intends to fulfill her contract if
an earnest attempt to do so can be of

\ VANCOUVER. B. Cl, Jan. 16.â A terrfbto
Story 'Of suffering' in a blinding snowstorm
and subsequent cold la told by Jonh P.
Stevens and 'William George Thomas, who
have Just arrived- at Nelson. There were
two others, in the original party, one of
whom, Samuel Hockaday, died of the ex
posure encountered and from the hard
ships of the trip. The fourth was- Matthew
"Wells.
"With an old miner named KobÂ«rt Lous,
the three left Siocan City on the morn
ing of January 1L The party had leased
a group of claims and went uj> to arrange
improvements. They floundered through
seven feet of snow until they had. Dearly
reached the property.
At 3:30 o'clock in the afternoon a packer
whom they met told them to turn back.
"Wells took this advice but the others went
on. They traveled for two hours, when
Thomas became exhausted and they
stopped and built a fire. In the evening
they went on for another hour, and by
that time Stevens* feet had become so
badly bitten that the men again made
camp Two hours more they rested and
then returned foe their property. The
trail by thia time had been lost. Hock
aday had great difficulty In keeping up
with the others, who were carrying the
packs.
Monday night was dark and a blizzard
overtook them. The air became no thick
that it was impossible for the men to Â»ee
an arm's length, while the driving icicles
cut exposed portions of their flesh. They
struggled on for three hours, making
three-quarters of a mile, where Stevens
threw down his sack of raw beef and re
fused to go another step. They made a
little trench behind a snowbank and the
men walked to and fro behind this shel
ter, with the flying shreds of ice tearing
their uncovered faces. They tried vainly
to light a fire. Hockaday finally became
sleepy and refused to walk. All were
weak from hunger and numb with cold.
Next morning they started again for the
claim, but Hockaday, being numbed from
the night's exposure, fell behind, and
when. his friends halted for him and he
came 'tip with them, they found M-nry In' a
delirium. They had finally to leave Hock
aday behind and it was two hours more
before they reached the cabin. After half
an hour's rest they returned but could
not find Hockaday. They searched air
that day and nlgrnt. and on "Wednesday
found the man frozen stiff where they had
left him. The body was brought Into the
cabin.

Dole's contention wiil be that the con
stitution of the United States, or at least
the tifth and sixth amendments, were not
extended to the Hawaiian Islands until
the Territorial act took effect on June 14,
1900, instad of being extended by the New
lands resolution, which took effect on Au
gust 12, 1898. In the interim the trial on
which an appeal Is now taken took place,
as well as a number of others/ which de
pend on the decision now asked for. The
case taken up is that of one Osaki Mam
kichi, convicted of murder. . / ,
The point as to Hawaii's status be
tween the date of annexation and the date
when the organic law provided by Con
gress took effect has never been before
the Supreme Court, and it is said to be
an entirely new question in the history
of the country. The legal discussion will
involve an inquiry into the history of an
nexation, and the force of the agreement
entered into by the Republic of Hawaii
and the United States, as it is claimed
that the acts of both parties showed an
understanding that Hawaiian municipal
laws generally were to remain in force
after the Newlands resolution until Con
gress otherwise provided. As Hawaii was
already a civilized nation, -with an elab
orate civilized system of government, and
voluntarily came into the Union, it is con
tended that the issue is much different
from any presented in connection with
other island possessions.
Attorney General Dole -will proceed to
Washington to argue the case.
HONOLULU, Jan. 11.â Attorney General
E. P. Dole has sent to Washington his
brief in the famous habeas corpus case,
which has been appealed by the Territory
to the United States Supreme Court. This
Is the case in which a prisoner tried under
Hawaiian law for murder, without a
Grand Jury indictment, and found guilty
by a majority verdict of nine trial jurors,
alter annexation, appealed to the courts
here for release, on the ground that his
presentment and trial had been unconsti
tutional. In the Circuit Court Judge Gear
granted a writ, but the Supreme Court
overruled him, the Justices standing two
to one. United States Judge Estee was
appealed to and be granted a writ and the
Territory, by Attorney General Dole, is
now appealing from Estee's decision. Es
tee held that the Newlands resolution an
nexing the islands, in declaring the laws
of Hawaii not inconsistent with the Amer
ican constitution should remain in force,
abrogated and annulled the Hawaiian law
as to convictions by nine Jurors.
Carlson was found and liberated this
morning, and an examination of the safe
showed that many valuable books and
papers had been destroyed. The robbers
failed to gain anything from their bold
attempt, as nothing had been left in the
safe the night before.
SEATTLE. Wash.. Jan. 16.â E. G. Carl-
Bon, night watchman of the "West Seattle
Grain Elevator Company, was overpow
ered by three masked men at 3 o'clock
this morning and tied to a chair. The
robbers then drilled the big safe In the
office, placed a stick of dynamite, poured
water in the coal stove to put out the
fire, stacked sacks of wheat around the
wareroom, and set off the charge.
The door of the safe was blown acros3
the room and Carlson was knocked un
conscious. The store was -wrecked, thi
robbers' act of extinguishing the fire un
doubtedly saving the building, and Carl
son's life.

XEW PRESIDENT OF THE SENIOR CLASS AT STANFORD UNIVER
SITY WHO TVAS GIVEN A REMARKABLY LARGE VOTE AT AN
ELECTION CONDUCTED BY THE STUDENTS.
The case was continued till Monday,
when witnesses for the defense will be
called to testify. Since the i shooting
Sauer's permit to carry a revolver has
been revoked by order of the Police Com
missioners.
The case for the prosecution was closed.
The witnesses examined were Samuel
Stocker, William Reid, Samuel Fitzsim
mons. Alexander Strang. Patrick Flynn.
W. H. Whessa, W. H. McCormick, Cor
poral M. Shanahan and Policemen Bruce
and Hemenez. Some of them testified to
hearing Sauer yell "duck" and the five
shots followed in quick succession.
The preliminary examination of George
Sauer, special officer at the Risdon Iron
Works, on the cliarge of assault to mur
der, .was continued before Judge Mogan
yesterday afternoon. Sauer is accused of
firing five shots at some men who were
working in.a trench for the new. gaso
meter of the Independent Gas Company
at Twenty-third and Michigan streets on
January 2. ' . . ,,-
L. A. Shaver, solicitor from the office
of the .United States Attorney General at
Washington, left for that city yesterday.
He came hither for the purpose of repre^
senting the United States Interstate Com
merce Commission In the trial of the suit
brought by that body against the South
ern Pacific Company, Union Pacific Rail
way Company and its successor, the
Union Pacific Railroad S Company for
charging a certain carload rate on sugar
from Pacific. Coast common points to
Kearney, Nebr., in violation of the inter
state commerce act. When Mr. Shaver
arrived a few days ago he found that the
counsel for the Union Pacific Company
was absent in the East and that there
was no disposition on the part of the de
fendants to agree upon a statement of
facts. United States District Attorney
Woodworth and Mr. Shaver have decided
to try the case next May. In the mean
while United States Court Commissioner
Heacock will take testimony based upon
written Interrogations to be hereafter
made-up. Â¦ â¢
"He will find out differently before he
gets through," answered Dalzell of Penn
sylvania.
Chairman Payne stated that the to
bacco men -would be heard on the 21st,
the beet sugar interests on the 22d and
that General Wood was expected up from
Cuba. The committee then ! adjourned
subject to the call of the chairman.
As the hearings closed Representative
Richardson of Tennessee, the ranking
Democrat on the committee, said: "I no
tice that a very prominent United States
Senator is quoted in to-day's, paper as
saying: the Senate will settle this whole
question, will make a treaty and that we
will have nothing to do with it."
When Representative Long brought out
that Place had sought free trade at Ha
vana the Cuban spokesman explained
amid laughter, that he yielded to the ma
jority, and that by asking much it was
hoped to get as near that as possible.
He gave 60 or 60 per cent as the lowest
concession which would gTant relief.
Louis Place, head of the Cuban delega
tion, was heard as to the tariff reductions
Cuba was likely to make In order to give
the United States control of the market.
He saiu the Cuban tariff was very low now
and should be raised 50 to 70 per cent,
and after that a differential granted to
the United, States sufficient to control the
trade as against other countries. He
favored ultimate free trade, both ways,
which, he said, was the only solution of
Cuba's . commercial problem.
Asks for Free Trade.
Robertson also sought to show that
American capitalists were buying large
sugar tracts in Cuba and -would be ben
efited by reciprocity more : than Cuban
people. v
Armstrong replied that the Interests of
all the Cuban people were bound up with
sugar production and must stand or fall
with it.- . -
Representative Robertson of Louisiana
asked a series of questions tending to
show that the Cuban people had not
spoken for reciprocity and that the move
ment was directed by "the sugar, peo
ple" Interested In the trade. '.-' . â¢ *;< . ;â¢
Charles Rabidan and C. P. Armstrong
of the Produce Exchange also spoke in
favor of reciprocity, and were examined
at length by Chairman Payne and mem
bers of the committee on the details of
our export trade to the island and the
effect of reciprocity on various sugar in
terests. :
The business men present gave their
opinion that quotations were accurate and
fairly impartial. â¢
McClellan remarked In this connection
that there was an evident purpose in some
quarters of prejudicing the cause of
Cuban reciprocity by creating a public
lmpesslon that ' the trust was behind it,
whereas all the witnesses thus far had
shown that the Cuban cause stood on Its
own merits.
Representative McClellan of New York
called attention to circulars received, by
himself and other members of the com
mittee attacking the current sugar quota
tions, and stating they were influenced
by the sugar trust.
Quotations Are Accurate.
Financial and economic disaster to Cuba .will
correspondingly injure our tj-ade and material
ly reduce our exports of flour, corn, lard, ba
con, pork, beans, peas, canned goods and. other
commodities. The material reduction of^ our
exports to and from Cuba followed by a cor
responding decrease in the carrying trade, will
result -in a loss of freight to ship owners.
This committee urges such reduction in the du
ties now levied on sugar and tobacco as will
avert this imepndins disaster and thereby safe
guard the interests we represent.
Should the United States refuse to grant a
reduction of duties on the Imports of the two
great staples of Cuba (sugar and tobacco) we
believe the result Will be ruin to the planters,
bankruptcy to the merchant and great distress
to the laboring classes of Cuba, followed by
serious industrial disturbances and disorder.
Ewan Thomas, ex-president of the New
Tork Produce Exchange, presented the
views of that organization. He said that
last year $9,000,000 of American food prod
ucts went to Cuba, about 75 per cent of
the business being done by members of
the Produce Exchange. Continuing, he
said:
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16.â Cuban reci
procity was again under consideration to
day by the Ways and Means Committee
with large representations of Cubans and
of various sugar and tobacco interests in
attendance. A delegation from the New
York Produce Exchange favorable to reci
procity and several delegations from the
beet-growing sections opposed to reci
procity arrived this morning.

LONDON, Jan. 16.â A strong belief pre
vailed in financial circles here late to-day
that negotiations for peace had been re
opened â¢Â¦â¢ between â¢ the leading Boers and
the British Government. South 'African
stocks rose in sympathy with the reports.
The exact nature of what was going on
was not known, but a representative- of
the Associated Press learned that leading
Boers had indirectly approached the Gov
ernment, protesting against the appropri
ation of "-farms in the Transvaal or
Orange River colonies by British settlers,
which system is now being rapidly pushed,
and that-, strong influence had been
brought to bear on the Boer leaders to
save at least a*- vestige of property for
their followers.
,, Whether what is passing to-day be
tween the Boers and the. British Govern
ment can be termed peace negotiations, or
what will be their result, can only remain
speculation for the present. The Stock
Exchange evidently takes a hopeful view
of the outcome.

The first bout was a farce, as Mike Sul

his opponent, tossed him over the ropes
and out of the ring. In the next round
buluvan was knocked down four times.
Referee Kitchen stopped the fight in the
third round, as Sullivan was in danger of
being seriously injured. The bout was
amusing while it lasted and put the spec
tators in good humor.
Billy Woods of Eos Angeles knocked
out Henry Martin in the second round

EXPLAIN EECENT SPEECH
The decision arrived at to-day is the
result of Bix weeks' consideration of the
general subject of Chinese exclusion, the
purpose being- to bring- all the Pacific
Coast interests together into the united
support of one measure. A special com
mittee, with Representative Newlands of
Nevada as chairman, has been going over
the different propositions and submitted
the result of its work at the meeting
held to-day. The bill as presented had a
clause covering the Chinese coming from
the Philippines, but the sentiment at the
meeting was in favor of making the pro
vision more sweeping. The foregoing
amendment then was adopted, the under
standing being that when the- bill was
taken up In the House and Senate some
chang-es might be proposed to this sec
tion^ The bill as a whole has been framed
with a view to making it drastic In everv
particular in excluding the Chinese. It
combines the main feature of the measure
drafted by the Bureau of Immigration
known as the Kahn bill, and that brought
forward by the Federation of Labor.
demonstrated to be effective, and It seems to
me the object of a Chinese exclusion measure
could be most wisely fulfijled by the re-enact
ment of that law with such amendments as I
have already noted. However, we to-day have
presented a bill which has now been intro

believed that thf wisest action that the com
mittee could take would be to re-enact for an
indefinite period the present Chinese exclusion
law with such amendments as would effectually
exclude Chinese from our Insular possessions
and prohibit the coming of Chinese from ir.ose
possessions Into the United States. I, there
fore, informally submitted a resolution to this
effect, to the committee, but did not press it to
a vote. The present law has been thoroughly

at work for six weeks trying to frame a Chi

in all of its provisions to members from the
Pacific Coast, and we hoped generally to toth
houses of Congress. The whole question has
been thoroughly discussed by the comuUttee;
hearings have been held at which delegations
from labor unions and other organizations wore
present. These delegations have been accorded
every privilege in presenting their views. The

mittee and presented & bill for its considera

-Representative Loud, chairman of the
committee, in speaking- to-day of the
measure finally prepared, said;
The bill thus to be introduced was
agreed upon at the meeting-- As finally
adopted the insular section reads as fol

WASHINGTON, Jan. 16.-At a largely
attended meeting to-day of Pacific Coast
Senators and Representatives a final de
termination was reached as to the course
to be pursued on Chinese exclusion leg

FORT SMITH, Ark., Jan. 16.-The
southbound Kansas City Southern pas
senger train was held up last night at 11
o'clock half a mile from Spiro, I. T., by
seven masked men. The express and
mail cars were entered. The local safe
in the express car was opened, but noth
ing secured from it. The robbers tried to
open the through safe, but failed. Then
they rifled the mail car and it is said se
cured a quantity of registered mail.
The scene of the robbery Is fifteen
miles from Fort Smith. A report to-day
from there says that United States mar
shals are scouring the country in search
ol the robbers. Three suspects, miners,
have been arrested and taken to Po
teau, I. T.
The robbers flagged the team between
Spiro and Redland. While two of the
seven men covered the engineer and fire
man with revolvers, others forced a por
ter to uncouple the baggage car. John
Block, a traveling salesman, alighted
from the train and was about to fire upon
one of the robbers when he was pre
vented by Conductor Sullivan, who feared
that the men would fire into the passen
ger coaches. The baggage car uncoupled
the engineer was compelled to pull up the
road a distance of one mile. There the
bandits went through the baggage and
mail cars. Their work finished, one of
the robbers handed the messenger the re
volver taken from him, and all made for
the timber.
This afternoon postoffice officials here
deny that any registered mail was taken,
and the express officials say that one
package containing |3 covers their loss.

-STOCKTON,' Jan. 16.â To-day saw an
agreeable , change in the weather. The
fog which had enveloped the city ' for
nearly a month lifted and for a time the
sun shone. It clouded up soon, however,
and a drizzling rain began falling. In the
absence of rain the fog, of the past few
weeks has been the salvation of the grain;

there is still considerable moisture in the

alarm, but were reassured by the calm
ness of the Mexicans. The proceedings
were interrupted for fully ten minutes.
When Senor Alzamora resumed his

It difficult to make the required weight
and had weakened himself in the effort.
The fight went the full fifteen rounds
for which it was scheduled and proved a
disappointment to the spectators. Gibbs
â¢seemed fighting "under a wrap." Round
after round went by and the spectators
were expecting him to cut loose and win
handily, but the end came without him
doing so. In the last four rounds Gibbs

ALL- AMERICAS.
The stars from the National League
presented a patched-up sort of a ball team
yesterday at Recreation Grounds, but for
all that it proved good enough to. make
Ixajoie's mighty sluggers run second. For
the -edification.- of 'the spectators and in
cidentally to add Vim and life to the con
test, Stelhfeldt and Jinx McDonald es
sayed to indulge in a little one-act pugil
istic comedy in- the third inning.' Fortu
nately the row was quieted before any
damage resulted.'
Mercer was passed and immediately
proceeded to steal second while Lee had
the ball. Lee turned and threw to Stein
feldt in. order to, retire the runner. Mer
cer slid and was? called safe by McDon
ald. ' Steinf eldt took exception to the de
cision and without any provocation what
ever struck the umpire on the face. Mc-
Donald's ire was thoroughly aroused and
he went for the player, landing a couple
of stiff punches. A lively exchange of
blows followed, but the men were imme
diately separated by the rest of the play
ers and a couple of special policemen.
rhe game required ten innings, and
while rather slow at times it was well
contested and was characterized by good
batting and some fast work in the field.
It was of , the see-saw order, first one side
leading only to be overcome by the other.
The Nationals opened the tenth with the
score board reading "three all." Broek
hoff took four bad ones, went to second
on van Haltren's sacrifice, advanced to
third oh a passed ball and arrived with
the winning tally on Steinfeldfs sacrifice
nit. The All-Americas could not score
in their half. , Although they outbatted
their opponents and at times outfielded
them, they could not get hits at exactly
the right time. v
Mercer played a star game at second.
In the fifth McHale hit one out away
over Mercer's head, but he was in the air
with one. hand, making one of the pret
tiest catches of the season. Again in the
eighth he threw Steinfeldt out at first on
a drive that looked quite safe. Broekhoff
lined out a tripple and a double, while
little Kelly performed .very well behind
the bat. Van Haltren worked his bunt in
old-time style, making two hits in this
way.
"Billy" Lange, the famous center fielder
who used to chase balls for Chicago, will
play center field for the, All-Americas
next Sunday. An endeavor will be made
to get Iburg and "Whalen to oppose each
other on the same day. The score:
"Billy" Lange Will Play in
Center Field for All
j Americas.
After quite a rest. Bernota came out in
the closing seven-furlong event and a
well backed second choice, ran as if an
extension of his vacation would do him
good. Floronso carried all the smart
money and backed down to even money
favoritism won galloping from Reina de
Cuba.
In the "kindergarten" scramble big
things were expected of Adirondack, the
Burns '& Waterhouse entry, which fact
enabled the followers of the favorite
Hudson, to get 3 to 2 against their money.
The outsider, Puss in Boots, led the first
choice into the straight for home, where
Mounce sat down hard on Hudson, and he
drew ahead, winning by a length. Bull
man on Adirondack, cut off soon after the
start, came on in time to nose out Puss
in Boots for the place.
Such a hot tip as Siddons was for the
mile and a quarter selling affair has not
been passed around* for days. Expecting
10, the top price the horse's admirers got
was 3, and only O'Connor's riding deliv
ered the merchandise. From the start the
good thing lacked speed, but O'Connor
persevered, and moving up foot by foot
from last position received the verdict
over Morinel at the wire by a nose. THe
others were strung out behind In proces
sional order.
Twelve started in the five furlong
sprint for three-year-olds, Â» with Tom
Ryan's entry, Our Pride, turning up a
handy winner, well ridden by Ransch.
The brother of The Pride raced the favor
ite. John Peters, to a standstill, and led
Bassenzo out with considerable to spare.
The winner's odds were played down from
10 to 5.
Four favorites were successful, Hudson,
Autolight, Siddons and Floronso. Bag
dad, at 25, and Our Pride, a 10 to 1 shot,
were the surprises. . -
Bagdad, a 25 to 1 outsider, ridden by
"Texas": Winslette, ran all around his field
in the first event, at seven furlongs, and
won easily from Novia, another outsider.
Marineuse, the favorite, . showed promi
nently to the stretch, and then began fad
ing: away. O'Connor on Gold Finder fin
ished third.
! a FTER the exciting conclusion to
f\ the Santa Cruz handicap over a
Ao\ mile at Oakland yesterday, when
A. j\ Autolight, carrying- U9 pounds,
v '-only beat Position *a short neck,
the latter shouldering 115, it was' easy to
figure why "Dell" Fountain's gelding cut
such a figure in past handicaps when
asked to pick up only light imposts. The
track was not as fast as it had previously
been, owing to the light downpour of rain
during the early morning, still Autolight
was forced to step the distance in 1:39% to
win. It is generally, conceded that the
last mentioned horse is the best of the
all-aged division here and he- closed an 8
to 5 chance. Four to 1 was laid about
Position and 4% against the Burns &
Waterhouse pair, San Nicolas and Scotch
Plaid. San Nicolas did not appear to have
a chance, and finished far back,, after dis
playing some early speed. At the start
Burns on Lapidus went out In the lead,
followed by Bathos and San Nicolas.
Down the back stretch O'Connor on Auto
light lay so far out of it that the horse's
backers were almost t-eized with heart
failure. Mounce made his move earlier
than usual with Position, turning into the
stretch third. He tried to steal a march
on the favorite, but Autolight stood for
all of O'Connor's hard urging without
flinching, scoring in a desperate drive.
McGinn finished third on JlmsHale.

Dr. Miles Medical Co, Elkhart, Ind.Q. â Do you remember anything whether it
referred to Mr. Deane's appointment or not?
A. â I remember another thing that was brought
to my attention to-day. Shortly after the con
tract was made the Chronicle had an editorial
in the paper in favor of Mr. Mahony. â¢
Q. â Do. you remember anything stated In,
that contract relative to Mr. Deane's appoint
ment? A. â That I cannot state, whether chief
deputy or registry clerk.
Q. â Mr. Flood, to the best of your knowl
edge torday, what was the consideration for
such appointment in that contract; why was
Mr. Deane to be appointed to any position in
the County Clerk's office by Mr. Mahony? A. â
The consideration?
Q.â Why was Mr. Mahony going to appoint
Mr. Deane to any position In his office? A.â
I think the consideration was by reason of tha
efforts he would make in his behalf.
Q. â To secure his election? A. â Yes, sir;
and his friends, I think.
Q.â And his friends? A.â And his friends.
I think.

lican Convention? A.â That I don't remember.

to that? A. â I do not; as to the contents, t
do not.
Q. â Mr. Flood, do you remember you stated
Q. â Since your memory has been refreshed,
what do you remember now in regard to that
contract? A. â Mr. Deane called my attention
to certain transactions, and I remember there
was a ccntract.
Q. â You remember you witnessed a contract?
A. â Yes. sir.
Q. â Do you remember you- drew that con
tract up? A. â I cannot get that clear in my
mind yci. The chances are I did draw it. or
whether it was from dictation, or maybe Mr.
Deane told me what he wanted and I sat down
and drew. up the contract.
Q. â You are sure it was typewritten? A.â
If written at all I am sure it was.
Q. â You signed as a witness? A. â I remefl*
ber I signed that paper.
Q. â Do you remember the contents of thai
paper? A. â No. sir, I do not.

Mayor. Since seeing you yesterday I had &
conversation with Mr. Deane to-day, in whicn
he refreshed my memory and called my at
tention to certain things, and do remeir.bÂ«T
now. As I said yesterday, I do not deny that
there was a contract drawn, but I want..:! tj
find out at the time, because I had urawri
several papers for Mr. Deane in the offlcj.
Q. â What was your reason? A. â To. find out
if he was going to make Mr. Deane l!w chief
deputy.
Q. â Whom, did you go with? A. â Mr. Brttt.
Q. â Isn't it a fact that you went cut to nee
if you could *4Uaro this matter up? A. â No.
sir, not exactly; to see if Mahony .was going
to carry- out hi* promise.
Q. â Tou went to Mahony's house to inter
view him? A. â He sent a reporter Â»:i a car
riage with roe.
Q. â What did you say to Mr. Leake when be
asked you if you had seen this? A. â I think
I asked him to show me the contract; if my
signature is there I woui.1 never Ueny it.
Q. â For what reason did you go to Ma
hony's hou3-v? A. â I said before an>talns i3
done with a paper like this Mr. Mahony ought
to be interv'eved and see what he has to say
about it. . â¢ - >
Q.â What did Mr. Leake talk to you about?
A. â He told me something about â asked me If
I had seen a contract.
Q. â What contract? A. â I said. "What con
tract do you refer tor' and he s<O.Â«i, "The
contract between Mr. Mahony and Mr. Deane, |
whereby* In the event of Mr. Mahony being
elected he was to make Mr. Deane chief
deputy," and he said, "Tour name is attached
to it, and Mr. Vallero's name :s attached to
it," and I says: "Mr. Leake, if you have
the contract, I would like to see it," and he
said, "I know the content* of It."
Q. â Did he tell you the contents of It? A. â
I don't remember whether he did tell mo or
not.
John C. Flood was recalled. His testi
mony follows:
The Mayor â Were you In Mr. Leake's office
on Monday evening? A. â Yes. sir.
John C. Flood Testifies That He
Signed the Document in
Deane's Office.
NOW RECALLS *
THE CONTRACT
Q. â Yes,- sir. .A. â Mrs. Deane telephoned to
my office before I got there this morning that
, Q. â That. was after Mr. Deane understood he
was out of the fight? A. â Yes, sir; that Is
correct. . . >
The Mayorâ You had an Interview with Mrs.'
Deane to-day, did you not? A. â Tea. sir.
Q.â Do you Â¦ mind - stating what was said at
the interview? A. â The one to-day? -
Q.â After Mr. Deane. had understood from
his friends that he was out of the fight and
couldn't get . the nomination, he went to Mr.
Mahony? A. â I understand that Mr. Mahony
came to him; that is as I got It. .
Mr. Riordan â As â¢ I understand you, Mr
Deane Informed you he had been to see- Herrin
and Henry Lynch and other people, and un
derstood he, was getting the double cross, and
therefore he wouldn't get the nomination? A
.Yes. sir. Â¦ '
Q. â When he first heard he couldn't get the
nomination he went to Â¦ Mr. Mahony and ob
tained from Mr. Mahony this agreement? A
No. sir; you cannot pat words in my mouth
Mr. Mahony had been to- him on two occa
sions prior to the signing of this contract, and
Mr. Deane referred to his friend, and thought
he had a chance, and then. I think the third
meeting â there might have been more â the
third meeting was when they drew up tills con
tract. -â¢W^aart4&gÂ« Â©SÂ«5*?*xÂ» VrJÂ»~-
CROSS-EXAMINATION,
Q.â You told this to Flood? A.â Yes. sir.
Q.â What did Flood say? A.â I can only
give you in a general way. He admitted every
thing I said was correct about the matter. Of
course, I didn't know that Flood knew any
thing about Deane going to see Herrin. There
was an absolute admission I was right in the
matter, and he wanted to suppress it, and he
would see that Mahony carried out the con
tract.
Mr. Ruef â Did you jtate to him there was
a consideration for. support; -you say support,
etc. ? A. â The conditions "â¢ were these : That
Deane was not to allow his name to go be
fore the convention. Mahony had seen Crlm
mins, and Crlmmins would guarantee him the
nomination. Deane had seen Herrin and Her
rin would support him, but he found out after
ward he was getting the double cross and
asked Henry Lynch what it meant, and Lynch
couldn't state. Then, , when Deane realized
he wai being double crossed.' he was willing
to draw out of the fight on Mahony' s promise
to make him chief deputy.
Q.â What did it contain? A.â The consid
eration of Mr. Deane's withdrawal from the
fight, and for his support to appoint Mr. Deane
chief deputy, and four or\ five others. I asked
if the names were mentioned, the four or five,
and he said they were not. . .
Q. â Did he admit . such were the contents of
the document? A.â Yes, in a general way. I
wouldn't say those were the exact words, but
ho admitted drawing up this contract, Â¦ and in
that connection when Mr. Britt came back I
questioned him very closely, and I think I am
correct in saying that Mr. Brltt told me that
Mr. Flood was surprised that I should be so
familiar with the matter. (To Mr. Britt) â Am
I right? Mr. Brltt â Yes. sir.
Q. â Did he tell you. or you tell him, the
contents of the document? And if so, state
what was said about the contents. A. â I told
him the contents of the document, because Mr.
Flood is a man I never met before. I wanted
him to understand I knew what I was talking
about. ' . /
Q. â Did he show a familiarity with the con
tents of the document? A. â Yes, he did not
hesitate: his whole aim was to suppress the
publication of it. This occurred In the office
of Mr. Martin, the business manager. 1
Q.-^-What did you tell him? A.â I told him
Mr. Deane had told me that Mr. Flood had
been called in to draw up this agreement. I
went further than that; I told him the circum
stances, about the different meetings of Mr.
Deane and Mahony, and that Mr. Deane' s
friends advised htm that he ought not to take
Mahony' s word for it â he had better get it in
writing. The second or third meeting Mr.
Deane had with Mahony, Mr. Deane said, "You
had better put this In writing," and called in
Mr. Flood, and Mr. Flood drew it up, and Mr.
Vallero was called In â he was in the outer of
fice somewhere. He begged not to have It pub
lished and he would keep his agreement â that
the publication would kill everybody concerned.
Q. â Did Mr. Flood tell you the contents of
this document? A. â No, sir. I told Mr. Flood
what the contents were â I told Mr. Flood in
advance what the contents were, and told him
what,I knew about it. .
The Mayor- â In your testimony yesterday I
intended to ask you one little question I wish
to ask you now. Will you state what Mr.
Flood told youâ what did Mr. Flood tell you?
A. â The evening before the publication of the
article next morning in The Call. I think it
was Mr. Brltt I sent out to find Mr. Flood, to
bring him down to the business office, and
when I met him I told him what I knew about
the existence of this contract, and. In the con
versation, which, of course. I could not begin
to repeat word for word â it lasted some little
time â he admitted to me and told me he had
drawn up this document, and told me a man
by the name of Gregory Valleroâ a man I did
not know â had witnessed it. He begged me
not to publish the article, saying it would kill
Deane, Mahony and himself politically, and if
I would give him a little time he would go out
to Mr. Mahony' s house and see if Mr. Ma
hony would keep his contract. I told him to
get out there pretty quick, and I called Mr.
Britt in and told Mr. Britt practically what
had taken place, and told him to go out with
him. Mr. Britt afterward came back and re
ported to me that on the way out Mr. Flood
had told him of the circumstances of the draw
ing up of this document.

ADMISSIONS
William A. Deane Â£ells Nature of che
Contract and How It Came to
Be Signed.
FORMER COUNTY
CLERK'S STORY
Q.â Did Mrs. Deane, at any time, tell you
the contents of that document? A. â I beg to
be excused from answering that. To be frank
with you I had a talk with Mrs. Deane In a
manner that I do not care to tell. I consider It
absolutely confidential. n-ZM'i
she would be at my office at 12:30. I waited
for her. Of course, she went over what we
had talked over before â about the circum
stances of this contract and how keenly she
felt this. She said it looked aa If Jt were a
question of honor and she wanted to destroy
this contract. I pointed out to her where 'she
was making a mistake, and told her she ought
to take advice, and she thought It would place
her in a bad light to produce a document that
would drag a man down, and I told her bo
many people knew of the existence of this con
tract that destroying it would have no effect
whatever. Nobody cared anything about It so
long as they knew the contract was made and
existed. She said: "I believe it is my duty
to destroy this, and If I do I am going to de
stroy it in the presence of reliable witnesses.
I will have an attorney." I said: "The attor
ney may make an objection that he would be
exempt from testifying as to the contents of
this." Since that time she has stated that Mr.
Joseph Leggett was the party she consulted
and Mr. Leggett said he would waive any
question of that kind and would be perfectly
willing to testify.
Q. â And the same as any one would assist
their friends after election, and that was the
whole conversation, wasn't It? .A. I think eo.
Mr. Riordan â As 1 1 understand you, the bur
den of the conversation on the occasion of the
first visit and .second visit was Mr. Mahony
was going, to do for Mr. Deane the best he
could? A. â Tes, sir.: .. .
Q. â Was . he in the same , frame of mind In
the evening? A. â Yes, sir; he was not happfr
in the evening. . ,
Q. â Did Mr. Mahony ask Mr. Deane to
withhold information? A. â Not In my hearing
The Mayorâ Was Mr. Mahony in a troubled
frame of mind .when he came to the house?
A. â Yes, sir.
Q.â Did Mr. Mahony accuse Mr. .Deane of
having given publicity to the Information? A
He did not.
Q. â Did he make any speelal reference to
William A. Deane? A. â I presume so: I don't
think there Is the slightest doubt but- what Mr
Deane expected to go into the office as head
deputy.
Q.â What, if anything, did he say about
other things? A.â He mentioned no other
things: Rimnly intended to put him back To
what he said lnÂ»detail it Is impossible for me
to swear. The general Impression was that at
the time he fully intended to have done for
these who did for him, and that was all
Q.â Did he say anything about any prom
ise ? A. â No more than this : He said if he
had time he Intended, in fact, it simply gave
me Â¦ the idea, if he had time he Intended to
return the kindness of the people who worked
for him. . .'"â¢'â¢.â¢
Q. â He called the first time on the day the
first article appeared In The Call? A. â Tuesday
morninj. . . ; . . Â¦
Q. â Did he call subsequently? A. â Tes sir 1
he did.
Q.â When? A.â I think It was the same
evenins.
Q.â Did he speak about the matters of the
publications In the journals? A.â Yes, sir
Q- â Will you kindly state what you heard
him on those occasions state from the first?
A. â One thing I heard him say, "It was an un
fortunate error."
Q. â When did he call there? A. â He called
there . the first time in the morning, the day
the first article appeared.
Q. â Since these matters have been published,
matters relating to the purported agreement
between Mr. Mahony and your husband to
place Mr. Deane in office, has Mr. Manony
called at your house? A. â He has.
Q- â Did you read it before destroying- It?
A. â I carefully did not, and I very carefully
did not read it I am in np way defending
any one's course and am in no way on any
side, but simply acted. -
Q- â No motives of tender sympathy? A.
Entirely out of a motive of sentiment that I
destroyed It; I. wouldn't use it.
Q. â I will ask you the question: Why did
you destroy that paper, after keeping it so
many months, to-day between 1 and 2 o'clock?
A Because last Monday night, I think It was
Monday night, there was absolutely no one
knew I had that paper, and it was a matter
of complete indifference to any one whether I
had it or not. When it became known I had
that paper and I was likely to be called on at
any time I gave a promise to a gentleman I
wouldn't destroy it until I saw him. and that
promise was simply this: That I wouldn't
add voluntarily to any one's burdens, whether
they brought it on themselves to bear or not;
it was simply a matter of heart and sentiment,
not in regard to Mr. Mahony personally but
in regard to anybody who would come under
that control.
Q. â Was It on his advice? A. â Absolutely
not. I needed no advice. If you ask me my
reason I will give it.
Q. â Will you kindly state where that was?
A. â I am perfectly willing. It was in the
office of Joseph Leggett, the attorney.
Q. â Up to what time? A. â I couldn't tell
you the exact hour. To the best of my knowl
edge between. I think, oh, yes, between 1
and 1:30 o'clock. . -
Q. â At that, time you allowed It to pass
from your custody? A. â No, sir.
Q. â It is still in your charge and control Is
it? A.â No. sir.
Q. â Do you know In whose charger and con
trol it is? A.-^It is In nobody's charge. I
Q. â Do you know where it is? A. â I do.
Q.â Will you kindly tell us? A. â It Is burned.
Q. â You destroyed It to-day? A. â I destroyed
it to-day.
Q. â Where did you destroy it? A. â I de
stroyed it in an office.
Q.â Did you have It to-day? A.â I did,
Q. â He had stated to you what the docu
ment was? A. â Tes, sir, he stated to me
what It was.
Q.â Did you keep the document? A. â Tes,
I kept the document always.
Q. â Have you it now? A. â No, sir, I have
not.
Q. â Did you Eee it sufficiently to remark any
signature to it. or any name appended to it?
A. â When the document was handed to me it
was handed to me by Mr. Deane, and as he
handed it to me lie said: "Here is a paper
I want you to keep." Then he told me what
that Â¦ paper was. and in taking the paper it
fell open a little and I didn't pay any at
tention, because I was looking at him and
laughed, and I said, "It may be valuable,, but
you will never use It; you are not that kind
of a man. Tou are not a man that will ever
use it. but if you want me to keep it I will
keep it." In unfolding this I saw it was a
typewritten paper and bore signatures, but I
did not even know the signatures It bore. It
was an involuntary glance, my mind was full
of the subject.
how much you recollect? A. â As I never read
a word of it I cannot recollect now; but It
was In my custody for a long time.
Q. â Will you state how much you saw and
â¢bearing the signature of A. B. Mahony and
containins the name of William A. Deane?
A. â I have seen a document purporting to bear
the names of William A. Deane and 'A. B.
Mahony. but I never read it.
' Q. â You have seen such a document? A. â
I have -seen such a document.; '
Q. â When you and Mr. 'Mahony entered into
this friendly agreement you neither one had
any desire to violate the purity of elections
law? A. â No, sir. â¢ 1
Q. â There was no such intention on either
side? A. â No, sir.
The Mayor â Tou cannot state any intentions
outside of your own. | A. â Not outside of " my
self.
Q. â Tou state for yourself? A. â I am sworn
to answer for myself.
â¢Mr. Riordan â Tou. know, the- friendly ar
rangements between you and Mr. Mahony, and
you .can .judge Irom Mr. Mahony' s actions
whether he intended to violate any law? A. â
I don't think he had at the time.
Q. â That "he had no such Intentions? A.' â
No, sir. . - "-' â¢
Q. â Mr. Deane, this was just a promise be-'
tween friends, such as have been made for
twenty years back and more? . A. â Tes.
Q. â Simply to provide, on the part of Mr.
Mahony, he and you having been friends for
a great many years, he would be your friend
if. elected to. office? Â¦ 'A.' â Tes, find, it was, no
doubt, as I say, to. satisfy friends of mine he
would'be friendly, to me. ,
â¢ Q. â The extent of that friendship was to ap
point you as chief deputy and to take care of
your .three friends? A. â Tes. 'sir. - 'Â¦-,
Q. â That was the consideration for which the
document was drawn up? A. â Tes, sir.
Q. â Mr. Deane, you. as a public officer, and
having been in politics a great many years,
you are perfectly familiar with the purity of
elections law? A. â Tes, sir.
Mr. Riordan â Mr. Deane, you, of course,
have been In politics, like Mr. Ruef and my
self, and know something about the subject
Of politics, do you not? "A. â Tes, sir.
Q. â And you know something about the pres
sure brought to bear upon a public official
who Is elected to a patronage office? Tes, sir.
â¢ Q. â In- other words, you have, out of fifty
holes in the County Clerk's office, about 5000
people who would like to fill those fifty holes?
A. â Tes. sir. â¢

FLOOD NOW REMEMBERS.
Mahonv has run but the first gauntlet.
He has Euffered for two days the exposure
of his Ignominy before a magistrate whose
authority he denied. To-day he must face
the Grand Jury, which body begins its in
cuiry at 2 o'clock this afternoon. Numer
ous "witnesses have been subpenaed and
the whole story of ante-election bargain
end sale will be raked to the surface there
with the sort of authority that strikes
terror to the heart of the wrong-doer.
"With the evidence before him Mayor
Schmitz will have to take into considera
tion three questions. He must decide to
his own satisfaction whether or not an
illegal act has been committed. He must
determine Â¦whether he has authority, i*
the law has been violated, to remove the
County Clerk from ofilce under any con
ditions. And he must decide whether
Kiordan's objection is valid that in any
event he cannot go into the question of
misconduct prior to his inauguration.
Grand Jury Next.
Mahony' s counsel â¢urged that Mayor
Schmitz consult the City and County At
torney, who, he said, is the proper legal
edviser of all county and city officers.
Riordan thought that Mr. Lane's advice
might change the Mayor's views as to
his authority to investigate charges of
misconduct prior to his own election and
tt> the election of the accused official,
especially when the official was a county
officer.
Mohony and Riordan continue to dis
pute the Mayor's authority to hold the in
vestigation, and Riordan again refused
to permit his client to be sworn or to
make a statement. They were present,
eaid Riordan, merely out of courtesy to
the Mayor. During a short recess, while
a witness was being brought from some
distance. Riordan remarked that he was
remaining merely from curiosity.
"Tou said you were here out of cour
tesy," the Mayor reminded him.
"We came out of courtesy and remain
through curiosity," Riordan replied with
seme trepidation.
Ho Testimony From Accused.
"Mr. Deane, this was just a promise
between friends, such as hav,' been made
for twenty years back and more?"
his agitation showed bitter disappoint
ment, and ehasxin and confusion.
There was comedy at times to lighten
up the proceedings, arid when Tom Rior
dan and Abe Ruef each sought to prove
the other's political sapacity the greater.
Mabony's public integrity and personal
honor were forgotten for the moment.
Riordan, too, calied up beatific visions of
the pastâ a past in which he was not un
known, when he asked:
A.â John Flood. , ' . ~ _

Mr. Ruefâ Have you seen that contract
since? A.â Xo. sir.
Q. â Did you ever see it more than once? A. â
No. sir.
Q. â Did you read It? A. â Casually; I looked
at the signatures more than anything. Mr.
Mahony had signed it and that .was about all
the interest X had in it. My brother told me
the substance. I was thinking: about other
matters.
Q. â Have you bad any talk with Mr. Ma
hony. the County Clerk, concerning this con
tract? A.â No. not specially.
Q.â Has he called upon you at all in ref

Q.â Since this matter was published? A â
Yes. Eir.
Q- â What statement, if any. did you make
concerning any contract?
,, Ml V* R 'ordanâ I would like to say here to
Mr. Deane that he is not compelled to answer
any questions.
In response to this Mayor Schmitz said
that he.would Instruct the witness that
he was expected to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth.
Attorney Ruef said that the witness
could, of course, refuse to testify, and
the Mayor could commit him for con
tempt. Riordan did not believe the Mayor
had this judicial function. Th3 examina
tion continued.
Q.â Mr. Deane, will you plea*e state as ac
curately as you can the contents of the docu
ment concerning which you have testified
which bears the signatures of Mr. Mahonev
Mr. Flood and Mr. Vallero? A. â I couldn't
very well state what it contained verbatim but
I can win substance that it was a contract
between Mr. Mahoney and my brother as to
his appointment of Chief Deputyship in the
office.
Q-â "Was anything said in the document, as
far as you now recollect, concerning: any con
tract for which this promise of Mr Mahony
was siven? A. â To the best of my knowledge
that was the consideration of my brother not
allowing: his name to go before the convention
and for his lending all the aid and assistance
he could to aid the election of Mr. Mahony
CROSS-EXAMTNATIOX.
Mr. Riordan: Q. â Mr. Deane. do you re

Number I â Those prices up there on Roxburys and Axmin- v a

the yard. All statements to the contrary are untrue and can be I
proved so. U

Professor O. V. Lange has some 1 very
realistic flower studies. C. E. Ackerman
has three clever pictures. One, entitled
"The Neglected Lesson," shows a pretty
girl bowed in sleep over the keys of her
piano. It is in red, and the light from the
candle on the instrument gives a -wonder
ful effect. There are a number of China
town pictures and studies of all kinds.
The exhibition will continue ' until next
Thursday evening.
The collection comprises 450 pictures.
These were made. by amateurs the world
over and have been exhibited in Chicago,
Philadelphia ' and other large cities. As
stated in the catalogue, the object of the
salon is the exhibition of that class of
photographic work which shall best ex
emplify artistic feeling and execution
without regard to particular schools or
faas. .

the collection of photo-etchings exhibited

worthy of notice. On the walls are pic
tures of endless variety. That the hang

ficient guarantee that they are of high

Perry Belmont doubtless felt badly when Tam
many refused to support his candidacy for Congress,
tnd felt worse when the voters of the district polled
a majority against him; but the crushing blow did
cot fall on him until Bryan declared he is not a

.British financial experts are busy trying to de
vise a means of increasing the revenues of the em
pire, and it is believed the chief increase of taxation
will be upon tea, coffee and s.ugar. The blooming
Britons, in fact, will have to get rid of their war
debt by swallowing it for breakfast.
The election of James B. McCreary to the United
States Senate from Kentucky has been variously re
ceived. Some authorities assert he will prove to be
one of the ablest men in the Senate and stand firmly
for good politics, while others recall that he is known
in his own State as "Oily Jeems," and say he is a very
smooth article and dangerous.
The bachelors' ball in New York this year seems
to have been unusually brilliant even for such af
fairs. It did not get started until near midnight, and
there was a supper at 1 o'clock, with another supper
about 4 in the morning. During the dancing of the
cotillon the ballroom was suddenly darkened, and
then, to the amazement of the company, there came
from two points in the gallery a shower of illuminated
balls which were taken up and tossed to and fro from
one end of the room to the other. Altogether the
scene is said to have been one of fairy brilliancy, and
doubtless the fairies were highly, pleased with the
bachelors. â¢
The. agitation of this subject shows to what extent
the British public has been affected by the struggle
in the Transvaal. It. is' probable the lessons learned
from the war will repay to future generations the cost
it will impose upon them. in the shape of a national
debt. . In fact the British appear to have learned^ at
last that their empire is by- no: means so secure as
they deemed it ; that as Kipling says : "Men, not gods,
devised it;. men, not gods^ must. keep."'.
The result has been an agitation for a radical
change in. the British system of school .instruction;
not in military schools only, but' in all public schools..
If/the agitators succeed in carrying out their plans
there will be less reliance hereafter in a manhood de
veloped on the playground and mentally trained
mainly in the classics. The British youth of the
future will be educated 1 in science and technology. If
he purposes to enter the army he will have to under
go a military training similar to that provided at West
Point, and when he takes command in war he will
furnish his men with something more than an ex
ample of pluck.
Before Kipling's verse was written, however, a
considerable number of persons in the kingdom had
discovered that modern war requires for , success
something more than an ability to win a game on
a playground. Pluck, tenacity and strength are as
necessary as ever they were, but they are no longer
sufficient. Officers who spend their time playing ball
of one kind or another are not fitted to command
men on the battlefield. The day when victories in
war, could be won on the cricket ground at Eton has
gone,. by. The officer of our time must learn his
trade, and skill in athletic sports cuts but a slight
FOR three generations the British people have
delighted in the saying attributed to the Duke
of Wellington: "The victory at Waterloo was
won on the cricket ground at Eton." The phrase
pleased them because it implied that the sports of
the public, sclibols of England trained boys to grow
up into a manhood capable of meeting any kind of
battle with courage, and winning it through a stub
born pluck nurtured on the ball grounds. The South
African war has shown them that they have relied too
much on the old public school training, and now Rud
yard Kipling has mocked the men produced in those
schools by" taunting them with being "fianneled fools
at the wickets and muddled oafs at the goals."
BRITISH SCHOOL TRAINING.
The announcement of this discovery comes as
something of a surprise to the country, for it has
been supposed that every Missourian was born with
enough sand in his system to serve all mortal pur
poses. Furthermore, it was supposed that if a Mis
sourian ever took" to swallowing doses of sand or
anything else he would take it in whisky and not in
water. However, we live and we learn. Possibly it
will be the custom in St. Louis hereafter to use sand
instead of sugar in whisky, tea or coffee, ancUthe ex
ampleinay spread during the exposition year. Should
the new remedy prove a universal cure San Fran
cisco will be all right, for we have sand to sell. - In
fact, we will be able to dispense with taxes and run
the city on the income derived from the sale of ster
ilized sand from the. park, provided it can be proven
that Pacific sand is. as efficacious as the Mississippi
River article. To, that end, we should begin boosting
our sand at once, for the proof ofits efficacy will not
From the. report that comes to us it appears the
discoverer of the great secret was for a long time an
invalid. He tried all that doctors could do for him
and all that patent medicines could do, but found
them of no avail to cure even a symptom of disease,
much less the disease itself. Then he noted that ani
mals are not afflicted with the unnumbered ills of
humanity find he began to study their ways. He
soon learned that animals have an instinctive fond
ness for earth, and perceiving that they have no
stomach troubles he concluded that earth is a specific
of high value. He at once decided 40 try it. He
gathered fine sand from the banks of the Mississippi
River and took a teaspoonful of it every day in a
glass of water. He claims to have been speedily
vured, and now, for the sake* of his fellow-men, he is
gathering the sand, sterilizing it and selling it at 25
cents a sack. The demand for it is said to be large,
and it is quite probable the problem of keeping open
the channel of the Mississippi will-be solved by di
verting the whole mass of sarid from the river bed to
the human stomach.
MANY and various are the ills that flesh is,
heir to, but even more numerous and more
varied are the means by which humanity un
dertakes to cure them. An exhibit of specimens of
the pills, bitters, tonics, drugs, tablets and plasters
that are now on the market would fill one of the lar
gest buildings ever erected at a tmiversal exposition,
and yet they do not by any means include all the
varieties of cure offered to a suffering race. There
are electric cures, water cures, heat cures, friction
cures, faith cures, bone-rubbing cures and cures by
the Roentgen ray. Still it has been felt that some
thing more is needed, and Missouri has come for
ward to furnish it. We are informed that a citizen of
St. Louis, who is at once a lawyer and a man of
science, has discovered that a small dose of Missouri
sand taken once a day will cure anything, and that
humanity need suffer no longer.
A MISSOURI SAND CURE.
It is estimated that the products of the United
States taken from the ground last year were worth
upward of $1,000,000,000 even in the form of raw ma
terial. That of course does not include grain or any
crop taken from above ground. It is merely a show
ing of what we can get out of the earth by just dig
ging for it. . ,
The plan puts each division upon its mettle, not to
show that it has a monopoly of the natural resources
of the State, but that it is making the best use of re
sources common to all three. It is easily seen that
this plan will produce the greatest exhibit the State
has ever made. California will appear in St. Louis
in her true character and aspect as the greatest dis
trict on the earth's surface. No other combines the
mineral, aquatic and terrestrial capacities that we
have here. Some may approach us in one resource,
but none has them all in combination. Our people
begin to see that they are the architects of their own
future and that of the . State. Nature has fitfully
smiled upon other places, but here alone does she lav
ish all the bounty of her favor in every material way
that affects the welfare of man.
When the raisins of Fresno, in Central California,
are shown alongside of those of Yolo and Colusa, in
Northern California, and the oranges of Los Angeles
and those of Oroville prove the common capacity of
Northern and Southern California in the production
of citrus fruits, all friction is taken away and each
section, instead of indulging disparagement of the
other, will address itself to making the utmost of the
gifts and graces which are the common endowment
of both.
As the State is nearly a thousand miles long, and
has practically the same climate and productions
throughout its length, such an arrangement will do
perfect justice to each division, and will show the
unity of the whole in its productive capacity.
It is gratifying to notice that the State Board of
Trade proposes a frank and open geographical clas
sification of the State by providing that at St. Louis
Southern, Central and Northern California shall each
be represented in an exhibit that in its unity will ex
ploit the whole State.
HERETOFORE in all industrial expositions
and in efforts at advertising the State there
has been a marked disposition to effect a
segregation of Southern from Northern California.
This has produced some friction, and perhaps has
worked some disadvantage to the whole. State,
through the natural disposition to disparage that is a
feature in all rivalry.
CLASSIFYING THE STATE.
Such a measure merits the support of the whole
community. We have in our State an illustration of
the folly of creating a commission without giving it
power to act. Railroad transportation affects not
only commerce, but every important industry, and it
is time that something were done to compel railroad
companies to obey the law.
It is to grant to the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion power to provide such redress that the bill now
before Congress has been drafted. The railroads have
fought the Cullom bill and other measures of the
kind by declaring that they aim at conferring ar
bitrary power to fix rates. The assertion is unfair.
The power which the bill proposes to confer upon
the commission can be exercised only- after a full
hearing of both sides, and is restricted to such
changes as may be necessary to bring the carrier
complained of into conformity with the provisions of
the interstate commerce act. a.
The Interstate Commission itself, in a report sub
mitted to Congress last January, and- to which The
Call directed attention- at the time, said: "In every
part of this country carriers have by concerted action,
without any notice to shippers, and indeed against
the vehement protest of shippers,- advanced their
rates upon a large portion of merchandise carried
under class rates an average of one-fourth." From
that and from other instances of wrong cited in the
report the .commission drew the just conclusion:
"When hundreds of shippers complain that a public
servant has perpetrated a wrong upon the public in
the discharge of a public duty, there should be some
public tribunal before which inquiry can be had and
by which^ redress can be administered."
Â¦ Since the law is thus defective it is not surprising
that the railroads pay '. but little attention to the de
crees of the commission and either evade them or
openly defy them.' Mr. Bacon cites many specific
instances where the efforts of the commission to ac
complish" justice haVe been foiled by a lack of power
to enforce its rulings. In fact, the railroads at times
frankly admit their defiance of the commission. Mr.
Bacon says: "At a hearing before the Interstate
Commerce Committee in the Senate on the Cullom
bill in April, 1900, in reply to a question put by a
member of the committee, the attorney of one of the
more important railways of the country stated that
the company which he represented had neye'r com
plied with an order of the commission without con
testing its validity /in the courts."
The limitations which hamper the work of the
commission are S et forth by. Mr. Bacon in the state
ment: "The Supreme Court has gone to the extent
of declaring that the law confers upon the commis
sion no authority to proceed- further when in any
case, after a full hearing of all parties in interest, it
finds that rates or regulations are unreasonable or
unjust, than to so declare, and to order the carrier to
cease and desist. from charging such rates apd en
forcing such regulations; and that the commission
has no authority to. declare what in its judgment
would be reasonable and just rates and regulations in
the casein question, or require such changes to be
made in them as would bring, them into - conformity
with the provisions of the act."
The importance of the issue is well presented in
the current number of the North American' Review
by Edward P. "_ Bacon, ia merchant who from the first
has been active in the work of. procuring an adequate
remedy for the Â«vils to which shippers are subjected
by' unscrupulous railway managers. He" aided in
bringing about the enactment of the first interstate
commerce act, has watched its operations closely and
is familiar with its' virtues "and with its defects. His
article abounds with illustrations of the weakness of
the law under which the commission. acts and of the
urgent need of conferring greater authority upon.it.
OUT of the Interstate Commerce Convention,
held in St. Louis about a year ago, there has
emanated a strong and well directed move
ment to bring about legislation conferring upon the
Interstate Commerce Commission power sufficient to
enable it to rightly perform its duties and enforce its
rulings. The executive committee appointed by the
convention has prepared for that purpose a. bill, now
before . Congress, and an active campaign of educa
tion has been .undertaken to arouse public sentiment
on the subject. 'z-v' -Â£"];, /. *
MORE POWER NEEDED.
The various voluntary wat&r and fruit associations
and organizations representing the grazing interests
should be heard from on the subject of providing
the fund now, with the view of arranging the method
of its expenditure later on.
Persistent disagreement by Western men over
these great measures should be discouraged. The
ci/;-Missouri country should acquire the habit of
standing together, like New England and the South.
When this is^done it will -be found much easier to
secure such measures as will foster the development
of this greater half of the continent.
On the other hand, they would be found cordially
combined in support of a bill to provide the neces
sary machinery, for using the money for the purpose
to which it is to be devoted. As far as the range
leasing bill is concerned,- the action of the Pacific
Stockmen's Association and the American Cattle
growers' Association in its favor brings it before
Congress and the country as the one measure in the
interest of the West upon which there is substantial
agreement. Its irrigation feature may well bring to
it also the support of all irrigators.
The Hansbrough bill, ,*to put into such fund* the
proceeds of land sales, and the Bowersock bill, to add
thereto the revenue from ' leasing the arid stock
ranges, it is estimated, will produce about $11,000,000
a year. As it is believed that the 400,000,000 acres of
grazing lands will -all be leased and producing within
a year, the next session of Congress would find in
hand a fund sufficient to start irrigation works in
each of the competing localities, and there would be
no reason for further rivalry between them.
If it prove true that this disagreement shunts the
proposition, the irrigators and all Western interests
should combine for laws which will provide a fund
and immediately begin its accumulation in the treas
ury, in trust, to be devoted to its purpose as Congress
may finally decide.
Under these circumstances the proposition' of the
irrigators to use for the needed conservation and dis
tribution of water the proceeds of the'.sale of the pub
lic lands was sure to pass if agreed upon by. the West
ern men. It is probable that they still stand agreed
upon that plan, and that the policy is wrecked upon
a divergence of views as to the. location of the first
work to be undertaken by the Government As the
sale of lands will produce only about $3,000,000 a year
for an irrigation fund, and the works for impounding
and distributing water will be costly, it is easy to un
derstand that localities will compete for the benefit.
Wisdom would dictate that all localities combine in
having the work started somewhere, in order to as
sure the stability of the policy of national irrigation
by bringing, it down out of the air to the ground,
If the Senator is correct in his view of the situation
it is to be lamented. The East is ready to indorse
any plan ,upon which the West agrees, provided it
does not call for burdensome appropriations from the
treasury. It is in immediate prospect that the Gov
ernment will undertake the construction of an isth
mian canal, and there is a general feeling, participated
in by the whole country, that the work should be
done on the pay-as-you-go plan. Whether .this, be
possible or not there is a determination* to hold the
treasury in a strong condition, against^anyjdemand
that may prove necessary. ' i '
SENATOR BARP announces the opinion that
the members of Congress from the Western
States will continue to disagree upon the ques
tion of irrigation, and that this disagreement will
compel the, whole subject to sleep again for an indefi
nite period. Vv.- ' : :

caused a good deal of surprise and no
Ht^le bitterness in the Baird household.
Thra young heiress to a portion of the
estate left by her father, John H. Baird,
made up -her mind to marry Baldwin and
as there was opposition to the union the
pair went off and married secretly. Since
that time there has been litigation in
which Mrs. Baird' was defendant. There
are two children of the unionâ Marie, live
years old, and John, aged three years.
Baldwin was engaged by the H. S.
Crocker Company at their Bush-3treet
house to take charge of the flics in-a new
department they established about six
months ago. He remained with the firm
four months and was remarkably popular
with the employes.

On rising in the -morning Mrs. Adrian,
one of. the household, noticed an odor of
e&capinggas and hastened to Mrs. Bald
win's room, thinking it came from there.
Finding that such was not the case, she
went to the parlor and there found young
Baldwin, fully-flressed, in a reclining po
sition on a lounge in. a dying condition.
A gas jet was open and. the room was
full of the deadly fumes, notwithstanding
that the window was slightly open. Mrs.
Baldwin was called, and as it was im
possible to arouse him Drs. "William Him
melsbach and H. It. C. Mendel were sent
for and a telephone message called ua
the family physician, Dr. Burnell. Upon
tne arrival of the medical men they did
In the evening the deceased remained
with his wife, Mrs. Marie V. Baldwin,
until 10 o'clock; at which hour Mrs. Bald
win retired. Baldwin remained in the par
lor and nothing was heard of" him again
by his wife, who slept soundly.
It is not for a . moment thought
by the members of his family or friends
that Baldwin took his own life, it. being
their belief that death was '., accidental.
The relations between young Baldwin and
his wife have been of a cordial nature
and i he was even contemplating a trip to
Manila, there to join his father, Barry
Baldwin Sr., who is in the Philippines
as the representative of the firm of Ma
condray & Co. ' ",'-- :; - '

Announcement
tTO THE
PUBLIC
ff f\WlSQ TO THE PA-
v/ vorable criticism and
many inquiries received
by us from the medical profession and others Â¦
Interested regarding our statement that the so- j
called weakness of men Is not a weakness, but j
symptoms of inflammation of the Prostate '
Gland (neck of bladder), caused by contracted -
disorders and early dissipation, and that Loss |
of Vitality, Prematureness. etc.. are Invariably
cured by procedures directed toward correcting
this inflammation,' we wish to state to these)
many inquiries, in the columns of the press,
that It takes approximately ten weeks to curs
these disorders of the male. The treatment la
entirely a local one, as no drugging the stomach ;
is necessary, and that the patient may treat i
himself at home under our direction. We will '
cheerfully explain the plan of treatment to any !
reliable physician on request. The colored chart j
of the organs, which we send free on applica- 1
tion to any one interested in the subject, will I
be found a gTeat advantage in "Home Diagno-
sis," as well as a study for all interested la |
their anatomy. Very respectfully, ;

How many, many young women are anaemic, pale, sickly-looking, perhaps
with pimples on face and neck, owing to poor, unhealthy blood. Perhaps wo-
manhood is approaching, that serious time of life when irregularities are liabla
to break down a constitution. The first rule for purifying and enriching the
â¢blood is to keep the bowels free and natural, gently but positively, without ner-
vous shock, and Cascarets Candy Cathartic is the only medicine to do it.

stocks. [Â¦
This market continues neglected at tha old

Provisions.
developed in yesterday's stock market failed to
persist to-day. With the urgent demand from
the Ehort* EetlEfied the buying: became apa
thetic. The selling was very light, but was
not well absorbed and the market moved in a
Fluggish and irregular way all day. J The rather
acute weakness which was manifest early In
the week was not renewed and there was some
appearance of support on the decline. This and
the positive strength of a few stocks In the list
steadied the tone after the decline had reached
considerable figures and resulted In recoveries.
The general level of prU^ro aid not get ' far
from last nijrht's level on the recovery and the
market became irregular again at the closing.
There is an element among stock operators
which holds the theory that large reserves of
capital are In the hands of Investors ready to
flow into securities the moment the downward
course of prices Is seen to hÂ»ve crone far
enough. This class hoped that the support af
forded the market yesterday would resolve the
doubts of the owners of this waiting capital.
and that it would flow into the stock market,
but the commission houses this morning failed
to reflect any notable Increase In their orders
tor execution. Â¦ The opening advance quickly
came to a standstill. Sharp weakness In Man
hattan helped the reactionary tone, that stock
dropping during the morning to 134%. Specula
tore In the stock have been fed with* the hope
that an arrangement for an interchange of
traffic, with the New York Central was impend
ing as a consequence of the disaster in the
Park-avenue tunnel. As yesterday's statement
by the New York Central directors of their
Plans for terminal improvements gave no cor
rcboration to the reported plan for Interchange
Â¦with Manhattan that stock was sold freely by
the epeculators. There was much discussion In
a general way of the recent new bond and stock
issues by various railroad companies and the
effect of this discussion was unfavorable to
speculation. Recent heavy outlays by railway
companies from the large current profits were
supposed to be a foreetallraent of necessary
thanges for betterments and to promise future
curtailment of expenses and the consequent
maintenance of net profit in future periods of
less prosperity. The current tendency to in
crease capital issues has disturbed this feelln*
c t.. M<rurlty over the future - The process of
piling up reserves In the New York banks
which seems to have gained much headway
during the week, failed entirely to stimulate
speculation. The money market continued
*nsy and sterling exchange showed no advance
The maintenance by the Bank of England of

CHICAGO, Jan. 16.^-The grain pits were
margin mad to-day. Ever since the raid on
Phillips last Monday brokers have been de
manding margins to the limit for fear they
might be caught in other failures. Rumors
that several firms were in dire straits were
circulated late yesterday on the curb, some
say with a view to depressing prices. Bears
used the rumors to-day as cudgels to beat
down the weakening and succeeded in raiding
prices. Bulls, however, Jumped at the oppor
tunity to buy in at the low prices. The opening
In wheat was badly depressed on yesterday's
curb weakness and lower cables. May opened
excited, %c to %c lower at 80c to 79%c. Heavy
liquidation was occasioned by a general call
for Increased margins. More stuff was thrown
out than could be readily absorbed and the pit
early ruled very weak. But as no failures
were reported at the opening a better feeling

' WHEAT â Liverpool and Paris futures were
lower again.
Chicago continued bearish and declined from
iBOUc to 78%c, subsequently recovering to
80^c. Winter Wheat broke, the weakness be
ing caused by continued liquidation and bear
raiding. The market, however, looked over
sold and a reaction 'was expected. Later on
the feeling became firmer, as a good many
early sellers began to replace their lines. New
York was a free buyer, supposedly for Wall
street account. The market was 10c under
Liverpool, as aglnst.6c before the break..
Â¦ Wires from Chicago to Bolton, De Ruyter
& Co. said: "The , country is still holding
firmly. There are rumors of Insolvencies, but
they are false, every house responding prompt
ly to Its margin calls. The Cincinnati Price
Current says that the weather Is unfavorable
for the growing crop, there being unbroken
clear skies all over the winter wheat belt.
Chicago Is very bearish. New York is very
nervous. There are moderate export orders
at New York, with 125 loads reported taken,
most of It being Manitoba wheat. St. Louis
reported that the Southwest and Texas were
after red winter, 250,000 bushels being? worked
for this account on Wednesday. The Argen
tine reported the corn crop unfavorable, being
seriously damaged by drought." :

with society's smart set last
night, on the occasion of Mr. E.
M. Greenway's revival of the
Friday Night Club. This dance
â¢was the first of two assemblies arranged
to take place before Lent. Nearly three
hundred guests were present in the most
elaborate evening dress. The affair was
conducted very much upon the lines of
the old Friday Night Club. There was
no german, but a cotillon, with two
bands, to furnish music for the dancers.
â¢The hall -was elaborately decorated In red,
with considerable foliage. Palms and
poinsettla ornamented the stage, % while
red draperies were festooned with greens.
All guests did not. arrive until 11 o'clock
and the dancing continued until a late
hour, interspersed with a dainty supper.
Following out the club's former custom
there was no reception committee. Mr.
Greenway was floor manager and did
everything In his power to make the atlair
a success. Many beautiful gowns were
in evidence. Some of them were as fol

tion of it. 1

of the contents? A.â There was, I think, a
promise to appoint Mr. Deane chief deputy.
Q. â Do you remember whether the docu
ment stated any consideration? A. â I don't
remember any consideration. It didn't purport
to be a contract, or agreement, pimply a state
ment, a promise.
Q. â Do you remember anything else about
the contract, of the contents? A. â I think that
is about all. substantially all. I remember to
H. I am quite certain there wasn't anything
eald about a. consideration at all.
q. How did that contract start off? A. â It
commenced with a preamble. I couldn't recol
lect the exact wording of it. It started oft in
the form of a preamble, "whereas."
q Were there any other signatures attach
ed to that document? A. â Yes.
q. Whose were they? A. â I cannot recollect
them Et al!.
q, Which names do you recollect? A. â I
think the name of Flood was attached to one,
but the other name was an uncommon name.
q. Was It Vallero? A. â It might have been.
I think it commenced with a "V"; I don't re
memberâI couldn't tell you it was thatâ I
think it commenced with a "V." It was a
name I was unfamiliar with.
Mr. Ruef â Did the conditions of the preamble
refer to matters referring to nomination, or
election, of County Clerk? A. â It referred to
candidacy.
q. To Mr. Mahony being a candidate? A. â
: Yes. sir.
Q. â Did it refer to Mr. Deane being a can

tion of Its contents? A. â I think I have given
you all the impression that remained on my
mind.
The Mayorâ You couldn't state what was in
the document, and what* was not in the docu
ment? A. â Not explicitly and particularly, be
cause I did not read it with a view to anything
| of that kind, but I have a general idea what it
was about.
Joseph Leggett was the last witness.
His testimony was as follows:
The Mayorâ Mr. Leggett, did you see thi3
afternoon or any time to-day a document, an
agreement entered Into between Mr. Mahony

THE CREMATION

many papers, many documents? A. â Yes. Elr.
Q. â Consequently, if it started off any un
usual way you would undoubtedly have re
membered It? A. â As any contract would. I
suppose: either, "whereas." or *'in considera
tion," or something like that.
Q. â Do you remember how that document
started off. A. â No; sir. I do not; I could
tell If I saw It whether it wasf my own or
not.
Q. â Was that document read aloud before
the four of you before you witnessed it? A. â
1 don't think it was, as I remember it, from
what Mr. Deane called my attention to it to
day. Mr. Mahony and Mr. Deane were in
the office for quite a long time together.
When I came In I don't remember whether
Mr. Deane dictated it to' me or told me what
he wanted.
Q. â Do you remember whether he read that
document before he signed it? A. â That I
couldn't say.

My impression Is I typewrote it.
Q. â Do you remember seeing him sign that
document as a witness? A. â Well, I don't
remember the physical fact of his signing It;
it Is my impression he did.
here having drawn up that contract; do you
remember having signed that contract; do you
remember who else signed that contract? A. â

FLOOD NOW REMEMBERS,
Sa far as I am concerned, this is a fight
betvreea IX Edward <?ol!ins and the manager
of the Enquirer. I have no Interest in the
matter and I <~Â«re not who winp. I am pub
l;s>iinp the Oakland Tribune ami th"y have a
rival n^wppsner. ThÂ«? matter docs not concern
roe one way or another.
Concerning tho charge that he was in a
oombination on city printing -with the Kn
quir^r. YV. E. Dargic of the Oakland Trib
une said:
J5p that as it may. however. I shall take the
proper steps to defend myself against Mr.
Collins' puit, an<1 when the proper time comes
ivill show that Mr. Collins is. to be polite about
1t. Â«T.tirely mistaken when he makes euch a
lot of foolishly untrue charges against me.
Mr. Collins has never spoken to me about" the
Inquirer cr its affairs, and the only attempt
be has ever made to approach me in the mat
ter vias to endeavor, through his agent, to Bell
mÂ» some Enquirer stock. I refused to buy it,
rot thinking for a moment that the refusal
would put me to the annoyance and expense of
defendins: myself apainst a false and malicious
suit en a lot of trumped up and scandalous
chargfp.
Now. as a matter of fact, I do not own one
Ebaoe of Enquirer stock, have no interest in it
end know nothing of its affairs. Mr. Collins,
therefore, did not tell the truth when he swore
to the charges lie has made agralnst me..
Pardee Makes Intimations.
While I have seen and very hastily read what
purports to be a copy of a complaint filed by
Mr. D. Edwrad Collins In a suit he has brought
against several other gentlemen and myself. I
pather from wltat I read of it that he charges
me with conspiring to defraud the Enquirer
Publishing Company and himself.
Dr. George C. Pardee made the follow
ing statement to-night in the Oakland
Enquirer:
I shall not be ready to talk about this case
until I have seen or have been served with the
complaint. I want to know what I hare to
meet before I can be placed in the position
of talking about the matter.
Henry P. Dalton, who is named in the
complaint as one of the controlling own
ers of the Enquirer, said to-night:
Until I have been eerved with a copy of the
complaint and know vrbat is charged. I can
"say nothing. In due time and In the proper
course of matters I Shall be prepared to meet
all of the charges that may have been made
by Mr. Collins.
G. B. Daniels, manager of the Enquirer,
returned to-night from Sacramento. He
said:
The complaint I have filed against the con
trolling management of the Enquirer Publish
ing Company speaks for itself. There is noth
ing I can say to add to It at this time. The
matter is now in thÂ« bands cf my attorneys.
Beyond all this are the flat charges
made of misconduct in the management
cf the Oakland Enquirer, which has been
for years an active element In the county
and city political life. The parties to tbe
case are not ready to go into a public
controversy over their business and finan
cial difficulties. D. Edward Collins, who
is the complainant in the suit against
Pardee, Dalton and Daniels, said to-night:
Collins Rests on Complaint.
The battle between the rival forces of
the Oakland Enquirer has settled down
to a waiting fight. With the beginning
of the suit by r>. Edward Collins, the mi
nority stockholder, who charges fraud
and mismanagement against Dr. George
C. Pardee and Henry P. Dalton. the al
leged controlling owners of the EnQulrer,
all concerned are waiting for the next
move. The case has been assigned for
trial to Superior Judge Ogden's depart
ment. None of the defendants, including
PanJee. Dalton and G. B. Daniels, the
manager of the Enquirer, have as yet
Leen served with the papers in*the case.
They are unwilling to talk about the
many charges embodied in the complaint
until legal service has been made upon
i hem. , :
Outside of the purely business Bide of
The litigation the light has assumed more
or less of political significance from the
prominent position that the two men
most actively mentioned in the charges
occupy in county and State political af
fairs. " Dr. Pardee, besides being a Regent
of the State University, has Deen strongly
rnentioned as a candidate for the Repub
lican nomination for Governor. Mr. Dal
ton has been Assessor of A lamed a County
for two terms and is an aggressive politi
cal factor in Alameda County. On the
other side Is Mr. Collins, who Is quietly
formidable in political life in Oakland.
Oakland Office San Fraacisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Jan. 16-
Floating In the waters of the Padfta
Ocean about eighteen miles from the month
of the Klamath River the body of James
A. Gallagher, one of the victims of the
Walla Walla disaster, was found. The
discovery was made by Captain Henry
Peterson of the steam lumber schooner
Newburg, and that vessel brought the re
mains to port last evening and placed
them in charge of the Coroner. Galla
gher was a general advertising agent,
traveling in the interest of a> syndicate
of Eastern magazines. His home was In
St. Louis, but he had spent six years on
the Pacific coast in the pursuit of hia
occupation. v
Captain Peterson sighted an object
drifting about in the water shortly after
9 o'clock Wednesday morning. He was
then about fifty-five miles from the loca
tion where the French bark is supposed
to have struck the steamer. By the aid
of a powerful glass he pronounced tha
form to be that of a man. He at once
ordered a boat lowered and that craft,
manned by the second officer and two
sailors, soon returned with a badly de
composed body encircled by one of the
Walla Walla's life preservers. The body
was hoisted on board and brought to this
city." ' .
When Chief Coroner's Deputy McCbr
mack took charge of the body there was
mystery as to its Identity. The Index
finger of the left hand was missing and
a purser's check showed that its posses
sor was a cabin passenger and had occu
pied room I, berth 3 and seat 27. Sev
eral business cards and addresses were
found, but . nowhere the unfortunate
man's name. Among the addresses were
those of Mrs. Burns, 167% Silver street,
and Miss W. Fontaine, 13 West Mission
street.
A card of the Leepalmer Hotel, O'Far
rell and Mason streets, furnished a clew.
Three hours after the body had been de
posited at the Morgue, Jack Hayes, a
bartender at the hotel, positively Identi
fied It as that of Gallagher. Hayes stated
that Gallagher wa3 well connected In St.
Louis and had once been a Deputy Bheriff.
in that city. The latter has spent about
six years on the coast, traveling: In tha
Interest of the advertising departments
of magazines during that time. He was
en route to Seattle when he met his
death. On the ship's passenger list ho
appears as J. A. Grey. He assumed thi3
name for personal reasons. He was about*
34 years of age.

The Cooks' Association of the Pacific
Coast has elected the following officers:
The first case reported to-day was that
of Miss Flora Disard and her married
sister, Mrs. Logan, who live at 722 Fil
bert street. They were on their way
home from a whist party, and when at
Seventh and Market streets they observed I
that an unknown man was following
them. At Fifth and Myrtle streets they
became so badly frightened that they
took refuge in the home of a friend. They
say the man followed them to the door,
which he rattled vigorously and then rang
the door bell. He received no response
and finally walked away, whistling. He
Is described as being about 35 years old
and hed black hair and a black mus
tache. Flossie White's assailant was a
tall man with long white hair.
Earlier in the evening the two daugh
ters of E. L. Dale of 669 Seventh street
had an encounter with an unknown man
at Seventh and Grove streets. They say
that he tried to seize one of them, but
i they eluded him and ran. He â¢ did not
Â¦ follow them, but disappeared down a side
Â¦ street. They could not furnish the police
j with a description of the man.
The police say that women, hearing of
! the experience of Flossie White, are apt
' t* be nervous when out at night and mis-
I take the ordinary acts of pedestrians for
; the mysterious behavior of the supposed
, madman who attacked the child. Â¦
As predicted by Chief of Police Hodg
kins. the attack Monday night upon 13
year-old Flossie White, the orphaned
niece of Policeman William McCloud. has
caused all sorts of reports to be mads at
police headquarters and hardly a night
paeses that some woman or girl does not
declare that she has had an encounter
with the mysterious stranger who beat
little Flossie and left her unconscious and
bound hand and foot upon the sidewalk.
Last night four women were frightened
by unknown men, and to-day they re
ported the occurrences to the police. In
vestigations prove, however, that in none
of the cases could it have been the same
man Who attacked Flossie White.

WASHINGTON, "Jan. 16.â The Senate
Committee on Â¦ the j Philippines torday had
under â¢ consideration: the 1 Ho9Se p Philippine
bill, .but. on the: reqjfeyt 6r.:t.he, Democratic
members for more ~,time"*ad3ourned until
next Monday ; without-retorting the bill.
All the amendments suggested by the
Republican members -were- adopted. The
most important of these amendments re
duces to the extent of 25 per cent the rate
of duty collected upon Philippine articles
coming into the United States and alsp
provides for a further reduction equiva
lent to the export duty charged on such
articles when shipped from the Philip
pines. The 25 per cent reduction is ac
complished by providing for the payment
of 75 per cent of the duty required by the
Dlngley tariff act. The provision con
cerning the export duty Is as follows:
The rates of duty which are required hereby
to be levied, collected and paid upon products
of the Philippine archipelago coming into the
United States shall be leas any duty or taxes
levied, collected and paid therein upon the ex-.
portation thereof from the Philippine archipel
ago as provided by the act of the United States
Commission under such rules and regulations
as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe.
Another amendment permits the em
ployment of -foreign vessels in the inter
island traffic as well as In the traffic be
tween the United States and the islands.
Still, another amendment strikes out the
House provision authorizing the with
holding of the cost of collecting Philippine
taxes and duties, thus requiring the
gross amount instead of the net amount
to be deposited in the special Philippine
fund.
An administration amendment suggest
ed by the Treasury Department was
adopted as follows:
Merchandise in bonded warehouses or other
wise In the custom or control of the officers of
the customs, upon which duties nave been paid,
shall be entitled on shipment to the Philippine
Islands within three years from date of the
original arrival to a return of the duties paid,
less 1 per cent on merchandise upon which du
ties have not been paid, may be shipped with
out the payment of duties to the Philippine
Islands within Â¦ said period under such bonds
and regulations as may be prescribed by the
Secretary of the Treasury.
Senator Lodge of the committee ex
pressed the opinion after the committee
adjourned that a report on the bill would
be secured on Monday. He also said the
total reduction- made by the committee on
Philippine sugar coming into the United
States would amount to 35 per cent.
The Democratic ; members of the com
mittee did not suggest any amendments,
but it is understood they will press for a
further reduction of rates.
After the committee adjourned the
Democratic members of it held a con
ference and decided to present a minor
ity report to â¢ the Senate recommending
that so long as the Philippine Islands re
main a part of the territory of the United
States free trade be permitted between
the islands and this country, and urging
that the islands shall- be put upon an in
dependent footing at as early a day as
possible, when they will suggest that the
Dlngley rates charged on Philippine im
ports.
The Democrats are urging the commit
tee to grant hearings on the bill.

Matheson was patrolling his beat when
a storekeeper informed him that three
boys had stolen a box of cigars from him.
While Matheson was conversing with the
storekeeper the boys appeared on the
other side of the street and Matheson at
tempted to arrest them. After running a
short distance the boys ran into a house
on Broadway and P6well streets and
climbed to the roof. Matheson followed
them, and in his anxiety to arrest them
he stumbled into a hole in the roof, fall
ing a distance of about fifteen feet.
His cries for. help attracted the atten
tion of one of the inmates, who notified
the officer on the adjoining beat. '
Policeman Matheson of the Central
Station division, while chasing several
boys who were suspected of theft, fell
through the roof of a house at Broadway
and Powell streets last evening and was
seriously injured.
Mrs. Mary Alsenz, a widow 71 years old,
v.-as found dead in her bed at 1S29A Bush
Ktreet yesterday morning. She had been
asphyxiated by illuminating gas. The
Coroner's deputies were informed that
her son-in-law. J. Giraud, noticed the
cdor of gas at a quarter past 7 o'clock
and traced it to Mrs Alsenz's room. A
g%s burner, with a patent chain attach
ment for lighting, was open and the gas
was escaping from it. The other burner
on the same bracket was turned off partly
and the gas was burning. For that rea
son it is believed that Mrs. Alsenz's death
was due to an accident.

CLAIM THE WORK
IS POORLY DONE
ber of Commerce, and the conditions then
existing still hold good, that America was
getting only about 15 per cent of the trade
of the Philippines, that the remaining
85 per cent^was handled by England, Ger
many and France, t and mostly through
Hongkong.
Armed with this knowledge of condi
tions, the Chamber of' Commerce ap
pointed a committee of twenty on direct
transportation ..to the Philippines. This
committee . secured from a number of
Eastern steamship companies an estimate
of the operating expenses of ocean
steamers. They also i secured figures as
to the cost of a six-week service between
. San Francisco and the Philippines.

greater per ton per mile favorable to the
plaintiff herein," as the answer &ays, than
the rates and amounts set forth in the
Bchedule.
prior to the action brought by John la
Blanc the plaintiff had voluntarily put ia
force a charge and rate for transportation
of petroleum oil between Las Angeles and
San Francisco of 5L4 cents per barrel,
a rate a little less than $3 15 per ton and
less than C.5 mills per ton per mile, and
that the schedule does not reduce or af
fect the rates. The claim is also made in
the answer that the schedule rate applied
to rates of transportation from rail points
of shipment referred to and to many
points of consignment other than those
mentioned in plaintiff's complaint, where
the rates allowed and collected, mileage
and distance considered, would be "much
The Railroad Commissioners filed an
answer yesterday to the suit for an in
junction .restraining the board from en
forcing the new schedule of rates for the
transportation of oil filed by the Southern
Pacific Company ten days ago.
In the answer every allegation made by
the railroad company in its complaint is
denied.
It is claimed by the Beard of Commis
sioners that the rate adopted at the meet
ing of December 10 of last year, and
which the railroad company claims is
lower than the actual cost of transporta
tion, is not a rate that will entail a loss
to the company. The board asserts that
the company Is not charging a rate low
enough to benefit the State, as the com
pany claims.
It is also stated in the answer that long
prior to the adoption of the schedule and
Deny That New Oil Rate
Will Entail Loss to
Railroad.
G. W. McNear, a member of the com
mittee appointed by the Chamber of Com
merce, stated yesterday that the mer
chants of this city were striving to se
cure a direct line to Manila. He said
that heretofore the shippers have had
trouble in securing transportation of their
goods. He hopes that witnin a short
time there would be" ships sailing from
this, port under the American flag and
that those having business in the Orient
will find ample accommodation for their
shipments.
W. M. Bunker has been in Washington
for the past three months laying these
facts before the Secretary of War, and
but for the appearance on ' the scene of
Hill and other big interests the members
of the committee think the new line
would be in operation very shortly.
Regarding the sale of the Government
transports the committee is not sanguine
If there is a sale and the. boats go to the
highest bidder it is feared that the bids
will be out of proportion to the immedi
ate value of the Investment. It Is not
thought likely, however, that the Gov
ernment will do away with Its transport
service for the one reason that it is only
by owning and controlling itstown ves
sels that the army can give proper at
tention to the sick and wounded soldiers
coming home from the Orient, and that
as long as the army of occupation re
mains of its present proportions this wiil
form an important factor in the transpor
tation problem. .
Effect of Hill's Move.
With this definite . encouragement the
committee secured options on a fleet of
ocean steamers. This fleet, if negotiations
now being conducted in Washington prove
successful, will be made up as follows:
The Boston Towboat Company's Hyades
and -Pleiades, now engaged as colliers
and two of the biggest carriers on the
coast; the International Navigation Com
pany's Pennsylvania, Indiana and Ohio;
several large steamers belonging to the
Luckenbach Towing .; Company of New
York, and part of the fleet of the Sagi
naw Steel Steamship Company.
In the meanwhile the committee secured
from Secretary of War Root a partial
promise of assistance. This assistance as
proposed by Root was to furnish the new
line with 2000 or 3000 tons of Government
freight for each trip at a rate in propor
tion to the operating expenses, this
freight to be gradually reduced as the
new line got on a paying . basis indepen
dent of Government assistance.
MATHESOH FALLS
THROUGH A ROOF
America Gets Small Trade.
Lieutenant Reiser informed the Cham-
THE entrance of "Jim" Hill and Se
attle in the fight for a Govern
ment-assisted Philippine line of
steamers has at least postponed
the consummation of the care
fully laid plans of a number of San Fran
cisct> merchants, members of â¢ the local
Chamber of Commerce. The plan was al
most complete. Operating expenses had
been estimated, freight rates calculated,
options had been secured on steamers sul
ficient in number and of suitable tonnage,
and Secretary of War Root had as good
as agreed to give the Gan Francisco com
bination enough Government freight to
warrant going ahead with the new line.
The new field is apparently tempting to
others, and now the Chamber of Com
merce is face to face with a fight in
Washington with some of the most power
ful influences in the country.
When the United States first acquired
the Philippines and the whole Pacific
Coast was talking about the commercial
benefit that would accrue to the ports of
the Pacific slope, the Chamber of Com
merce took steps to get at the actual
facts.
When a certain measure of peace had
been restored In Manila and trade In that
port had begun to resume its normal re
lations, a representative of the San Fran
cisco merchants was sent out to investi
gate.
Lieutenant Reiser, a volunteer army
officer, then and now in charge of the Ma
nila Custom-house, gave them the infor
mation which convinced them that if the
Pacific Coast wanted to derive any bene
fit lrom America's islands across the sea
the establishment of a direct and well
equipped steamship line was an absolute
necessity.
The plans are now In the hands of Com
missioner Jlansoa and the fire under
writers have taken up the matter, as they
see a grave danger in permitting the alter
ations as they are now outlined. It is al
most certain that the plans will have to
be revised so that firewalls will be built
to the height of the wooden building.
Though the first permit called for an ex
penditure of $400, it is a fact that a sum
largely in excess of that amount has been
spent on the alterations. In fact, work
covered by the second- permit asked for
has been commenced, though the ordi
nance requires that a permit must first
be obtained from the Board of Super
visors and approved by the Mayor. No
such permit has yet been granted.
It Is claimed that the building is not to
be enlarged, but it is a fact that if the
extensive alterations are made it will be
fireproof in one portion and non-fireproof
in another, which would certainly be a
violation of the ordinance in that essen
tial particular. The building has been
moved flush with the adjoining building
and no provision has been made for a fire
wall on either side.
No building already erected or hereafter
built within the lire limits shall be enlarged,
raised, altered or built upon in such a man
ner that were the said building wholly built
or constructed after the passage of this order
it would be a violation of any of the essen
tial provisions of this order. . . -
Another subdivision reads:
Subdivision 4 â Xo wooden building within
the fire limits shall be enlarged or built upon.
The building in question is owned by
Charles Carpy and is located on the south
side of Geary street near Stockton. A
permit was recently granted to cut the
building in half, to remove one-half to
the rear of the lot and to raise the two
halves to allow of stories being placed un
derneath, the new work to be of brick or
stone. The cost of the work was said to
be $400. The proceeding up to this time
was legal under the building and fire or
dinance, which permits of a building being
removed from one part of a lot to an
other. Objection was made by surround
ing property owners, but the work was
allowed to proceed.
The illegal part of the proceedings be
gan, however, when City Architect Mooser
approved a -permit for alterations to the
same building, aggregating $25,000. Mooser
in his private capacity prepared the plans
for the work, and then as a city official
recommended that the permit be granted,
though the btiilding and fire ordinance
clearly says:
i City Architect Mooser occupies the
unique position of having officially ap
proved a permit for alterations and re
pairs to a frame building within the fire
limits, he being the private architect em
ployed by the owner of the building to
prepare the necessary plans. In doing so
Mooser has violated the plain provisions
of the fire ordinance.
COMMISSIONERS
FILE AN ANSWER
"I consider these people who are now
trying to ret hold of Uie 'Mammy' Pleas
ant estate a lot of boodlers, andâ"
"Whom do you mean. Mr. Eaton?"
"Well. I mean these people I see in
front of me," said George It. Eaton, the
assignee of Mrs. Pleasant's estate, with
a. wave of his hauid toward the table at
which sat the attorneys for the creditors
who petitioned for his removal.
"Do you mean to say that I am a bood
ler, Mr. Eaton?" asked Attorney Charles
Pence, whose questions had caused the
"Well, you can draw your own conclu-'
fions," retorted Eaton.
Judge Troutt, before whom the petition
for Eaton's removal is being heard, in
terfered at this point and prevented any
further questioning, asserting at the same
time that Eaton's op.inlon did not make
any impression on the court.
Eaton, when asked about the supposed
assets in his charge, denied the existence
of any.
"If you want to count le-gal entangle
ment assets, then there are numerous
assets," said the assignee.
Eaton aiso testified that he did not press
the suits to recover property supposed to
belong to Mrs. Pleasant because he did
not see his way clear to prosecute them
to a successful finish. He said he would
undertake to enter a suit to secure the
property at 1661 Octavia street and the
rajich in Sonoma County if the creditors
of Mrs. Pleasant demanded it. "I will
also find the money to defray the ex
pense of the litigation,' said Eaton.
Eaton also testified that he never im
portuned Fred Bell to offer the creditors
50 cents on the dollar for their claims, and
continuing said that Sam Davis s^i&gested
to him that something could be made out
of the estate If the claims against it could
be bought up.
The case will be argued and submitted
this afternoon.

COMPANY NAMES
BANKING FIRM
Brown Bros, to Handle
Bonds of Street- Car
S>U System.
Indications That New York
Capitalists Will Get En
tire Issue.
Bankers in San Francisco have received
advices from the East that Brown Broth
era, widely known as financial agents, will
handle the new bond Issue of the consoli
dated street car system of this city. The
banking house of Brown Brothers is es
tablished 'in Lo'ndon, New York. Phila
delphia and Baltimore. The Fhlladalphia
house is the parent Institution, although
the London,, house conducts the largest
financial transactions. The local corre
spondents of the firm are the San Fran
cisco National Bank and Parrott & Co.
Leading bankers In this city have no
hesitancy In saying that the position of
the Brown Brothers is so high and the
influence of the .house so potent that
bonds issued sunder the auspices of tha
firm are eagerly sought for and readily
taken.
Indications are that the new securities
will be taken in New York, although Phil
adelphia and Baltimore agencies may re
ceive an allotment. The San Francisco
National Bank is not advised as to the
magnitude of the proposed bond issue.
Neither has the bank received any in
formation to the effect that even a block
of the new securities will be offered in
this city. .
It does not follow that the financial
agents, whp doubtless secure a good com
mission for marketing the securities, will
have a hand in I the management of the
consolidated street car lines of San Fran
cisco. The Baltimore syndicate that pur
chased the Sutter street, San Mateo, Su
tro and Market-street roads Is not an
auxiliary institution of Brown Brothers.
The purchasers of the system saw oppor
tunity Â¦ for good investment and availed
themselves of it. Local bankers say the
syndicate displayed good judgment in ap
pointing Brown Brothers financial agents.
SECRETARY FAY
LOSES HIS JOB
Park Commission Elects
Herbert L. Schmitz
in His Stead. )
The Board of Park Commissioners at 'a
meeting yesterday afternoon at the park
lodge elected Herbert L. Schmitz, brother
of Mayor Schmitz, secretary of the board
to succeed Phil Fay. It; seems that the
Mayor signified that this selection would
be agreeable to him, and the board, ad
hering to precedent, conformed to the
wishes of the chief executive, who is ex
offlcio a member oi the board.
Shortly after the first Park Commission
under .the new charter was created James
D. Phelan, then holding the office of
Mayor, and being ex officio a member of
the board, expressed to the Commission
ers a wish that Mr. Fay should be ap
pointed secretary. Commissioners A. B.
Spreckels, Reuben H. Uoyd, Fred Zeile,
John A. Stanton and Jasper McDonald,
as a matter of courtesy, readily respond
ed to Mayor Phelan's wishes. "When
Mayor Schmitz signified a desire for his
brother's election to the office of secre
tary the board was constrained to recog
nize the precedent established by Mr.
Phelan.
The president of the commisison, A. B.
Spreckels, made the motion for H. L.
Schmltz's election and he was supported
by Commissioners Reuben H. Lloyd and
A. Altmann. The motion was opposed by
Commissioners Jasper McDonald and
Frank J. Sullivan, Democrats.
Herbert L. Schmltz is connected with
the business department of the Bulletin
and is highly commended by Thomas
Boyle.
