In this suit the public saw the possible
making or unmaking of a Governor, the
making or unmaking of a newspaper and
the eternal -struggle that is on in Ala
meda County politics for the making and
unmaking of politicians. -
Mr. Ach began with the questioning of
M. de L. Hadley, who is a director of the
Enquirer and has been secretary of, the"
corporation since it was Â¦ first organized.
Mr. Ach wanted to get possession ' of .the
minute and stock books of .the paper! and
had ordered Mr. Hadley.to produce them
in court. ' He: soon found-* out rthat upon
the day that the suit brought by Mr. Col

possession of the books and put themfjn

Daniels produced the books, j

]AKLAND, Feb. 7.â Just as the at
torneys were getting, down to the
political questions in which the
general public is Interested in. the
suit between the stockholders of
the Oakland Enquirer, the taking
of the depositions before Court
Commissioner Babcock was ; sus
pended and will . not be continued
until Monday. Henry Ach, who repre
sents D. Edward Collins, the plaintiff .was
Just beginning to inquire whether Dr.
George C. Pardee and Henry P. Dalton
had ever talked with G. B. Daniels, the
president and general manager â¢ of 'the
Oakland Enquirer Publishing Company,
about controlling the politics of Alameda
County through newspapers, when there
was a consultation between some of the
attorneys and this line of questions, for
which the political public has been wait
ing, was abandoned for the time.
Now, ; if .-Â¦ it is understood they are to bo
identified by the"attorneys,~the same as be-
The unsuccessful effort to get the books
through Mr. Hadley closed the morning's
proceedings, and In the afternoon G. B.
Daniels took the stand. Mr. Daniels pro
duced the minute book of the corporation,
and then followed an active fight between
the attorneys over the possession of the
volume. Mr. Ach tried to get it into the
possession of the Court Commissioner,
but failed.- The contest was an active one
arid during it Court Commissioner Bab
cock took umbrage and threatened to quit.
"When the books were produced Attorney
Hill/ representing Daniels, said:
Q.â Did he give you a receipt for either or
any of those books? , A.â No; but after he told
me that he would put them in a safe deposit

Q.â At the time that he took that minute

corporation did he take any other books so far

I am satisfied, however, that whatever 1Â«
stated in the communication from Mayor
Schmitz Just presented to me by 'you. which
attempts to define to you the law governing
the matters called to your attention, was stated
by him without any Intention on his part to
do anything which he had not the right to do.

to give you the instruction that you request.
Judge Cook refused to administer any
rebuke to Mayor Schmitz for the tone of
his letter to the Grand Jury. He stated,
however, that he failed to find any evi
dence of willful or corrupt misconduct on
the part of the Justices of the Peace on
which action by the Grand Jury could be
based.
The opinion, read by Judge Cook, was
as follows:
Judge Cook holds that the charter pro
vision relative to the appointment of tho
Justices* clerk is unconstitutional, and
that the vacancy caused by Williams' res
ignation must be filled in the manner pre
scribed by the State law, namely, tem
porary appointment by the Mayor and
confirmation or permanent appointment
by the Supervisors.
Superior Judge Carroll Cook yesterday -
gave the Grand Jury the benefit of his ad
vice.oh the questions involved in the Jus
tices* clerk tangle at the request of that
body. The weight of hia judicial opinion
serves to settle Powell Fredrick more
firmly in his position, at least as a tem
porary appointee, and to crush the pre
tensions of the Justices of the Peace to
the possession of the power to appoint *
successor to E. W. Williams.
Says Successor to Williams
Has Not Been Legally
Appointed.
There has been much illness at the
school of late. There are several other
cases of pneumonia besides that of young
Roosevelt, end this afternoon the school
was closed for two weeks on account of
the prevailits sickness. The boys have
been in the tabit of running about bare
headed all winter. This is thought to ac
count for soric of the serious colds.

cally deserted, for a majority of the stu
dents departed for their homes during the
afternoon and the others will leave in the
morning. On receipt of word that Mrs.
Roosevelt would come to Ayer from Bos
ton on the first morning train, arrange
ments were made' to meet her at the sta
tion. The school is about a half-mile
from the station.
Much Illness at School.
GROTON, Mass., Feb. 7.â The condition
of Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was reported at
9 o'clock to-night as being "as comfort
able as could be expected." Those who
are in attendance at the lad's bedside de.
clined to give anything more definite. It
was understood at the school, however,
that the patient showed some improve
ment during the afternoon and early even
ing.
President Roosevelt himself is very like
ly vo go to Groton to-morrow, and will do
bo except in the event of \*ery reassuring
news being received during the night. If
he Joes go he will return almost immedi
ately if his ton's condition will admit It
already has been decided that Mrs. Roose
velt must remain by her son's bedside, but
if his condition is such as to make it safe
for the President to go farther away from
him he will keep his engagement to go to
the Charleston Exposition and will leave
with his party on Monday night, as orig
inally planned.
Hope for Better News.
There is no attempt to minimize the
danger of an acute attack of pneumonia
and the President and Mrs. Roosevelt are
well aware that the young man's condi
tion is serious. Everything possible is be
ing done for him and the best physicians
and nurses are in constant attendance.
According to the earlier reports the
son's condition has remained almost un
changed since morning. During the late
afternoon and early evening, however,
several reassuring messages were received
at the White House from Groton, the
tenor of which was that the condition of
the President's son at this time is satis
factory to the attending physicians.
Another message received during the
Cabinet meeting stated that the young
man's temperature was 104. Arrange
ments were at once set on foot for Mrs.
Roosevelt's departure for Groton this aft
ernoon, and since the first intelligence was
received the President has been in almost
constant communication by telephone and
telegraph with the college faculty.

The first information to reach the Pres
ident and Mrs. Roosevelt of the Illness of
their son was received at the "White House
by telegraph at 3:20 this morning. The
message was signed by the president of

DENVER, Feb. 7.â Lying alone in a lit

Brunswick Hotel. Dyer S. Smith, once
the "king gambler" of the West, is dying.
Not until yesterday was it known that the
man who was once the star, gambler of
Chicago and all Western cities was facing
death.
Within the past two years Smith has
gradually been playing a losing game and
disease had fastened on him. He came to
Colorado a sufferer from diabetes and has
grown worse rapidly until it is now only
a question of days when death will come
to him.
Twenty years ago Dyer Smith was the
best known name among the -gambling
-fraternity from New York to San Fran
cisco. It was In Chicago and San Fran
cisco that he made his greatest winnings.
He broke more banks "and gambling
houses and made higher ' runs than any
other "knight of the green table." He
was known to every police captain and
detective in San Francisco. Smith fre
quently came through Denver, but
stopped here only a short time and played
very little.

Judge Cook quoted at length from this
decision, which concludes as follows:
Charter Provision Invalid.
I do not know that I am called upon to de
cide whether the Mayor's views' as to his
power to appoint a successor to Mr. Williams
are correct or not. I have, however, care
fully examined the argument advanced in this
communication, and from snch examination.
coupled with an examination of the constitu
tion of the Etate, the statutes of the State
the charter of this city and county and the
decisions of our Supreme Court, and from such
examination my opinion is that neither of the
contending parties are correct in their inter
pretation of the law applicable to the sub
ject. The contention of the Mayor is that
chapter 7. section L of the charter, controls
the office of clerk of Justices' Courts of this
city and county. In the case of The People
vs. Cobb, 133 California, decided last April,
our Supreme Court held that city Justices of
the Peace were a part of the Judicial system
of the State. In the case cf The People vs.
Toal. 83 California, 333, affirmed In the case of
Minor. 121 California. 2C4, the Supreme Court
at length reviews the force and effect of muni
cipal charters. *
The reason why I state to you that it is my
opinion that nothing in the communication- nt
Mayor Bchmitz shows any willful or corrupt
misconduct in office is this: The Mayor's
opinion that it does constitute such miscon
duct in office seems to be based upon his con
struction of the jaw relative to the jmwer of
appointing a successor to Mr. Williams, the
former clerk of the Justices' Court- The Mayor
holds one \-lew upon this matter and tfie Jus
tices of the Peace evidently hold another. It
is. therefore, apparently a clear difference of
opinion as to a question of law rather than
any wiilful or corrust misconduct In office.
The communication handed to me, after ex
plaining at some length the writer's under
standing of the law relative to the appoint
ment of a clerk of th* Justices' Court, which
1 shall refer to later on, chargesF-one Joseph
Windrow witn. having usurped an office, and
therefore liable to criminal prosecution, which,
of course, as is stated by Mayor Schmitz him
eelf la his communication, is under section 65
of the Penal Code but a misdemeanor, over
which neither you nor the Superior Court has
jurisdiction.
I cannot rind, however, in the communication
from Mayor Schmltz that you have just hand
ed to me any fact stated which In any way. In
my opinion, constitutes any willful or corrupt
misconduct in office.
2io "Willful Misconduct.
A Justice of the Peace, not coming within
the provisions of section 737. just referred to,
does, in my opinion, come within the provisions
of section 75S. Therefore, if from any investi
gation that you can make, you should find
that the Justices of the Peace of this city
and county, or any of them, have or has been
guilty of willful or corrupt misconduct in of
flce, you may present an accusation against
them or him therefor. Such accusation must
state the offense charged in ordinary concise
language and without repetition.
And it is provided by the 6ucceeding sec
tions of that chapter of the code that all im
peachments must be at the bar of the Senate
Of tlie State.
"All other civil officers shall be tried for
misdemeanor In office In such manner as the
Legislature vr&y piovide."
Section 737, to which I have Just referred,
provides that: "The Governor. Lieutenant
Governor, Secretary of State, Controller, Treas
urer. Attorney General. Surveyor General,
Chief Justice, Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court and Judge* ul the Superior Courts are
liable to impeachment lor any misdemeanor in
office."
This section is taken from article 4, section
18, of the State constitution, and under It all
officers, other than those named in section
737 of the Penal Code, are liable to impeach
ment or liable to be tried for misconduct in
office, and if found guilty removed therefrom.
The constitutional provision Just referred to
reads:
"An accusation in writing against any dis
trict, county, township or municipal officer for
willtiU or corrupt misconduct in office may
be presented by the Grand Jury of the county
for or in wS'ih the officer accused is elected
or appointea ''
The first proposition contained in said com
munication refers to the actna of me Jus
tices of the Peace in soloctlng a chiei cleric of
the Justices' Court of this city and county,
and sections 75S to 772 of the Penal Code are
referred to as being the sections under which
you are asked to proceed. Section 75S of that
code provides as follows:
Grand Jury Has Jurisdiction.
to explain to you the law relative to ihe propo
sitions advanced therein.
From this, gentlemen, you will see that
ther may exist an honest difference of opin
ion . between the Mayor and Justices of the
Peace, and that therefore such Justices can
not be said, from the acrions mentioned in
this communication, to be guilty of willful and
corrupt misconduct in office, and until the
matter be settled in a proper proceeding as to
which of these contentions is correct, no mal
feasance In office growing'out of the holding
of such opinion can be attributed to the par
ties holding the same.
On the other hand, if the clerk of the Jus
tices' Court holds his office by virtue of the
charter provisions and not by virtue of sec
tion 88 of the Code of Civil Procedure, then
and In that case a vacancy existing In the of
fice, whether it be through the resignation or
through the removal by the Justices, ls a va
cancy which must be filled in the manner
prescribed by the charter.
I can find nothing in the statutes of the
State which authorize the Justices of the
Peace to do more than recommend to the
Bonrd of Supervisors a person to be elected by
them to the office.
It is clear, however, under my view
of the law, that no successor to Mr.
Williams was appointed by the Board
of Supervisors of this city and coun
ty on a written recommendation of
the Justices of the Peace in 1900, nor
in 1902, and that, therefore, it is tho
duty of the present Board of Super
visors, on the written recommenda
tion of the Justices of the Peace, ta
Appoint a Clerk of the Justfces' Court
Under the provisions of section 86 of
the Code of Civil Procedure of this
State above - referred to. In the in
terim and pending the action of suca
Board -of Supervisors, my opinion is
that the of nee. must be filled in the
manner, provided by law for the fill
ing of vacancies in an office created
"by Â¦ statute, and does- not rest with
Justices of the Peace, but such ap
pointment by the Mayor can only be
a - temporary appointment, holding
until the Supervisors act in the
premises.
Mr. Williams having now resigned the of
fice, as contended by the Mayor, or having
been removed from office, as contended by
the Justices of the Peace, has ceased to hold
such office and has ceased to be the clerk of
the Justices' Court. An appointive office with
a fixed term cannot be terminated at the will
of the appointing power. No provision of the
statute authorizing his removal by the Jus
tices of the Peace has been called to my at
tention, therefore I "am not able to say that
the existing vacancy arose from the action
of 6uch Justices in declaring the office vacant.
As I understand the situation, Mr. Williams,
tha former clerk of the Justices' Court, was
originally elected by the Board of Supervisors
of thls^city and county to such office on the
written recommendation of the Justices of the
Peace of this ciry, and acted -under section SB
of the Code of Civil Procedure. After the
charter went into effect this section of the
Code of Civil Procedure seems to have been
considered as Inapplicable, and the Justices of
the Peace proceeded under section 1 of chap
ter t of the charter to elect a clerk, who under
that provision of the charter would hold of
fice without bonds and would have the right
to apr>oint five deputies instead of two and
reappointed Mr. Williams to the office: and
eubsequently, after he had held such office
for two years he was again appointed by such
Justices and thereafter suspended by the Mayor
and subsequently of his own motion resigned.
Temporary Appointment by. Mayor.
From my interpretation of tne law both ap
pointments of Mr. "Williams as clerk by the
Justices of the Peace were void, and at the
time of his resignation he was holding; office
under his original election by the Board of
Supervisors on the written recommendation of
the Justices of the Peace, his successor never
having been legally elected or qualified, i. e.,
he never having been legally appointed his
own successor. AH officers elected or . ap
pointed to an office for a definite term are

is or may be required of other officers of such

deem It necessary. The Justices' clerk shall

CHARTER SECTION INVALID
Continued From Page One
A short time ago Dunlap petitioned" the
Board of Supervisors for franchises for
five electric railways radiating from this
city. More than 100 miles of railway is
included in the franchises, and it may be
that the syndicate that has bought the
watershed is interested in the railways.'
The franchises were awarded to Dunlap,
but axe now tied up in court by an ac
tion brought by Myron Wolf, who claimed
his bids for some of the franchises were
higher than those of Dunlap.
For many, years the, advantages of the
water power" of 'the 'Coyote watershed
have been recognized, but, although sev
eral syndicates have Investigated them,
nothing was done until Dunlap took up
the proposition. Just 'what use will be
made of the water is not known. It is
believed a big'power plant will be erected.
Power for Electric Kailways.
The Headlight Investment Company was
organized by Dunlap in Nevada in "July,
1900. It has a capital stock of $1000. The
directors are: D. Torreyson, T. R.
Hofer and Ed J. Walsh. When Dunlap
lirst began' to purchase the land on the
Coyoto, he transferred, some of it to the
Headlight Company, but it is hardly like
ly that company has anything to do with
the water power project, as It in turn is
transferring land to Morrison.
Twelve miles northeast of Gilroy the
watershed narrows down to the course of
the Coyote, and here surveys have been
made for an immense impounding dam.
By obtaining possession of the land the
promoters have now gained control of an
immense water power.
Just who is back of the scheme to divert
the waters of the Coyote to commercial
purposes is unknown. George T. Dunlap
transfers the land to A. F. Morrison and
the latter is undoubtedly the agent of a
syndicate. The largest transfer is one of
S500 acres from F. A. Hyde to Morrison,
and the Headlight Investment Company
of Nevada sells 570 acres to Morrison.
Impounding Dam to Be Built.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 7.â That some large
syndicate has obtained control of the
Coyote watershed in the southern end of
Santa Clara County is evident from the
many transfers of real estate filed in the
County Recorder's office here to-day.
documents were placed on rec
ord, covering between 13,000 and 20,000
acres of land. The price of the
land is not given, but the reve
nue stamps show a valuation of ?37o,
000. It is said that nearly $500,000 was in
volved in the transaction. Most of the
property has been transferred to Alexan
der F. Morrison, who is a member of tne
law lirm of Morrison & Cope of San Fran
i cisco, and it is believed this gentleman is
representing some large Eastern syndi
! cate. .
For a year past George T. Dunlap of
Gilroy has been purchasing land in the
Coyote watershed for some company un
known. Several streams converge with
Coyote Creek in the vicinity of Gilroy,
forming , a perfect watershed, and the
deeds riled to-day cover these streams.
The tracts transferred cover a territory
twenty-live or thirty miles in length and
spreading from a narrow strip at the
west to twenty v miles in width as the
lands follow the /windings of the Coyote

* Three months after the date of -the let
ter word came to the Sheriff's office of
this county that two horse thieves were
making their way southward with stolen
animals. W. H. Coons was then Sheriff,
and he deputized W. J. Yoakum, who was
later hanged here for murder, to hunt
down the thieves. Yoakum took with him
David McKenzie. ; Webster Heath, W. H.
H h Ji e> I 1 man named Lamott and .others
of the frontier type.' After traveling some
days the posse located the thieves asleep
on a flat west ofCummlngs Valley, with
the stolen horses staked out about them.
The posse crept up close to the uncon
scious men and when they were awak
ened a fight ensued. McKenzie and one
of the thieves were badly wounded. The
other thief made his escape. The wound
ed man was captured, and when searched
aeo'a, watch on which was engraved "J.
H. Or. was found, as well as a diary with
the name "J. H. Gardinier" written on
the. flyleaf. The outlaw insisted that he
was Gardinier, but it was later learned
that he was not.
The captive was put upon a horse and
started down the mountain trail to Tejon.
On the way the animal stumbled and so
crushed the wounded man that he died
within a few moments.
Dr. Gardinier learned of this border in
cident, and since that time he has been
searching throughout California for his
lost brother. It is generally believed here
that the horse thieves had started from
Placerville with Gardinier and murdered
him for his money on the way to Cum
mings Valley.
BAKERSFIELD, Feb. 7.-Dr. Gardinier,
an aged resident of Lake County, arrived
in Bakersfleld yesterday on a quest which
is developing into a story as interesting
and as strange as those found in -the
pages of fiction. For more than thirty
years' he has endeavored 'â¢, to learn the
whereabouts of a missing brother if alive,
or, if the brother be dead, to gather some
information as to his last days on earth.
The missing man was J. H. Gardinier,
and his strange disappearance was closely
connected with a battle between horse
thieves and th'e peace officers of Kern
County, which occurred in the hills west
of CummingV Valley in the spring of 1870.
Gardinier 'left his home in New York in
the '60's, and was last heard from at
Calaveras City, Tuolumne County. From
there he wrote a letter, to his mother and
sisters at home, conveying the news that
he had disposed of some stock and was
about to start for Arizona. That was the
last ever heard of him.
Dr- Gardinier has not given up hope
that he may some time find his missing
relative, or at least locate his last resting
place. 'â¢Â¦. â¢ .

ter from the late President McKinley:
"WASHINGTON, March 3, 1899. '
Secretary Long to-day issued the fol
lowing order 'regarding the retirement of
Rear Admiral Sampson:
Â» Navy Department,
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7, 1902.
Sampson's Retirement.
It was j stated authoritatively later in
the day that what had been used as a
basis for the reports of a serious change
for the worse in the condition of Ad
miral Sampson was a slight attack of
indigestion, which caused no alarm among
those nearest him, but which confined him
to his room . and bed for several days.
Moreover, . it . was : stated that Admiral
Sampson's condition was improved to-day
and that he appears \ brighter than for
some time ,past. However,; it has been
stated that Admiral Sampson's Â¦ general
condition is ' such as to give some basis
to the ever-recurring bad reports. Yet at
present, it is said, . absolutely no forecast
of the end of the fight his vitality is
waging can be made.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â Alarming ru
mors were afloat here to-day to the effect
that Admiral Sampson had taken a seri
ous turn for the worse within the last
twenty-four hours. Inquiries , at the
Sampson residence and of the naval phy
sicians developed that there has been no
decided change in the admiral's condition,
but that a steady retrogression is in pro
gress which Is common to his disease.
From the t Oregon, too, there is available evi
dence to show that when the first shot was
flred the quartermaster of the Oregon, using
the long glass, could, from the position of that
vessel snear the center of the line, read the
New fork's battle signals then flying.
All this evidence was ready to be presented
to the court of inquiry and it is ready to be
presented to you. It was not admitted before
the court - because . it refused to go into the
question of command. Rear Admiral Sampson
has never objected, i and does not now object to
an inquiry to determine the question of com
mand. He has, however, reported that he was
la command : at that battle. As commander
in-chief he has made his recommendations con
cerning the promotions. He has been recognized
by the executive and judicial departments of th-
Govemment as being In command and he asks
that when the accuracy of his reports ls ques
tioned he at least be permitted to hear the
evidence in opposition and to permit his brother
officers to come forward with the evidence
they are ready to give in his behalf CYlaence
There is further an abundance of evidence
available to establish the fact that what the
applicant now calls "the complete and total
rallure.of the .. prearranged order of battlp"
was due wholly to his own disobedience of the
orders of the commander-in-chlef These or
ders were to close in and to hold the enemv
at the harbpr"s mouth. Commodore Schlev so
understood the orders. He hoisted that very
signal.. Yet when he^ saw the enemy approach

We have no desire to prolong "this contro

be a finding adverse to Admiral Sampson either
by the President, the courts or thâ¢ Nav^ De

.The President will consider the brief In
connection with Admiral Schley*s appeal
When the Shot Was Fired.
We are ready to show that under the navy
regulations and the judicial interpretations
thereof. Rear Admiral Sampson was -during
the battle In command of every single vessel
in the American line. There Is abundance of
testimony available to show that from the
beginning of the battle every American vessel
at Santiago was In sight of the New York.
There Is evidence at hand, both record and
oral, to show that whenever the Commander
in-chief left the blockading line in front of
Santiago he hoisted the signal "Disregard
movements of . commander- in-chief ." proceeded
to the point where, under the regulations, his
immediate command of the squadron - ceased,
and then signalled to the next In rank to take
command; and that on the morning of July
3 the commander-ln-chief had given instruc
tions to *have ready for hoisting the signal
directing Commodore Schley to assume com
mand; that this signal was to be hoisted when
under the Â¦ regulations the appropriate moment
had arrived; that that moment had not ar
rived and that such signal had not been hoisted
when - the enemy . endeavored to escape from
the harbor. â¢Â¦.Â¦ '
><o argument will be submitted as to the
volunteered opinion of the presiding member
of the court upon . the question of command
at Santiago. We repeatedly applied for an
opportunity to present evidence upon this
point to the court and our request was" as often
refused, and we are confident that an attempt
to pronounce an adverse judgment where a
hearing has been denied is so- plain a viola
tion of simple good faith that It has no chance
of receiving your approval. We were ready
then and are still ready to produce much evi
dence which was not offered before the court
on this question. We are prepared to show
that the statement, that '.the New y8rk at the
beginning of the battle "was out of sight of
each and every ship of the blockading squad
ron but one" is inaccurate.

PASADENA, Feb. L-To-day's session
of the State convention of the Young
Men's Christian Association was devoted
chiefly to addresses and class work. The
only business feature of interest was the
report of the' committee on nominations,
which reported its selection of officers for
the ensuing year. The report received
unanimous confirmation by the convention
and resulted in the election of the fol
lowing:
Prisoner Is Landed in the Placer
County Prison.
AUBURN, Feb. 7.-OutIaw Choate, who
was wounded by officers in Colusa County
last evening while attempting to escape,
is wanted In Placer County for highway
robbery. On August 23 last Choate held
up the Colfax and Forest Hill stage and
robbed the passengers of $14. Just a
month before, on July 3, Henry Wise, a
confederate of Choate, had held up the
Auburn and Forest Hill stage, killing one
of the lead horses. He has not yet been
captured. Choate was under the surveil
lance of Sacramento officers, having Just
come out of San Quentln, but he. man
aged to evade them . and renewed his
career of crime in this county. Sheriff
Keena returned to-night with his pris^
oner.
TAKEN BACK TO AUBURN.
He was lifted back Into the carriage and
brought to Colusa, where Dr. Belton
dressed his wounds. He was hit four
times. One bullet entered the mouth and
came out through the right cheek; one
penetrated his left shoulder, a third
struck him in the hand and the other
penetrated his hip. None of the wounds'
will prove fatal.
his revolver and Manor fired four shot*
while a bullet from the outlaw's revolver
barely missed Manor's hqad and powder
burned his face. Finally Choate dropped
to the ground, exclaming:
"For God.'s sake don't shoot again. I
am hit."
SAXTA ROSA. Feb. 7.â Burglars broke into
the sample rooms of the Occidental Hotel early
this morning: and carried. oft Jewelry and cut
lery to the value of $2DO that had been placed
on display by a commercial traveler. The goods
were the property of GearEon & Baer of San
Francisco. I-ater In . the day Ed Jordan was
arrested u?on suspicion.
For a few minutes three weapons were
spitting bullets as fast as their owners
could pull the triggers. Marders emptied
keeping afloat until his cries brought as
sistance. After his rescue a physician
worked over him three hours before he
recovered sufficiently to tell how he had
met the accident. The cold had so numbed
his sensibilities that it was impossible for
him to feel any pain when he was clutch
ing at the stone walls of the shaft In hl3
efforts to find something that would sup
port him.
Marders drew his pistol and at the same
instant three shots were fired from the
carriage. The prisoner staggered back
ward a few feet and then raised his piatol.
Outlaw Falls Badly Wounded.
"Hands up!" shouted the outlaw to his
guards and the attending Deputy Sheriff.
They had gone about four miles when
they met Deputy ShenlT Marders. be
lieving the prisoner was handcuffed and
not likely to give trouble, Marders told
the Constable to proceed and he would
follow. Not fifteen minutes later Marders
was surprised to see Choate pitch hca'l
long from the carriage, roll over on the
ground and spring to his feet, revolver in
hand.
A carriage was engaged to convey the
prisoner to Colusa. Choate was given the
back scat with the Constable, while Manor
handled the reins. As they were passing
the Williams Hotel the prisoner asked his
guards to get a package beloglng to him
in the hotel. This was done and he placed
the package in the bottom of the carriage.
At 6 o'clock the start for Colusa was
made, the officers little suspecting that
the innocent appearing package contained
a Colt's revolver and a belt of cartriasos.
"Well, boys, you have got the wrons
man. I know nothing of the robbery you
have pulled me for."
but Mrs. Manor had also informed Con
stable Forsythe of Williams and the lat
ter, aided by Joseph Manor, arrested
Choate before the deputy's arrival. Choate
made no resistance. He seemed surprised
and said laughingly:
Death.

COLUSA. Feb. 7.-Charles Choatc,
alias H. C. Hill, the Auburn
County stage robber who was
captured yesterday in Williams
through information given by a
rancher's wife, made a bold attempt to
escape last evening while being brought to
ColuEa. In the flght that followed be
tween a Deputy Sheriff and a Constable
on the one side and the outlaw on the
other, the latter was wounded four times
and recaptured. -
Choate was wanted by Sheriff Keena of
Placer County for the robbery of the For
est Hill stage, near Coirax, on August 3.
The lone highwayman profited by his
crime to the extent of only $14. Since then
Sheriff Keena has been tireless in the ef
fort to capture the robber and had eent
his description and a photograph to every
Sheriff in the State.
Shortly after the robbery a man applied
at the Manor ranch near Williams for
work and was engaged as a milker and
butter maker. He proved a good employe
and vrorked there several months. After
he had left it was learned that he was
the man wanted for the Forest Hill staKs
robbery. The affair was forgotten until
yesterday, wh"n the same man stepped
up to Mrs. L. G. Manor at Williams, made
himself known and applied for his old oo
sition. Mrs. Manor said she would let him
know before she returned home whether
the place was open to him. She im
mediately telephoned to Sheriff Sherer In
Colusa, telling him that Choate was in
Williams.

VANCOUVER, B: C.. Feb. 7.-Donald
Todd, a Vancouver cannery man, and his'
wife had a lively time yesterday morning
near China Hat lighthouse, while ' in an
anchored schooner. Just at daybreak the
Todds were awakened by; a strange tu
mult. Suddenly the schooner . received a

.found ; the 'schooner surrounded .by a
school * of twenty- five or - thirty whales
The monsters were snorting and blowing
around in the shallow water' while en

So alarmingly close to the schooner did
they come that Todd and his wife lost no
time in picking up the bow anchor and
hauling on: the stern line till the craft
was beached' on the sand, out of, harm's
way. The blow dealt the craft by the

When the afternoon session opened
Judge Harrington expressed his determin
ation to conduct the case on more rigid
lines. Raker again resorted to "educa
tional" questions in violation of the ruling
of the court.- .
Baker's Second Close Call.
On these occasions Sturtevant raised his
voice to a high pitch to drown out Raker
and prevent his getting Improper matter
before the jury. Once Sturtevant dis
played his disapproval by saying, "Wow!
Wow!" :
Baker â Only a little dog's bark.
The Â¦ court â What's that? What's that?
Raker, you go to Jail until 6 o'clock for call
ing any one In this courtroom a dog. . Â¦ :
Raker â I did not call him a dog. Judge.-.
Sturtevant â Don't send him to jail on my
account, your - Honor; I don't care what he
says.
Mrs. .Nichols was on the stand all the
afternoon and her testimony was the
same as that of Mrs. Rucker and Mrs.
Crowley In almost every particular. Mrs.
Nichols, said that on the night of May 30
she passed Trowbridge's store at 9 o'clock.
It was brightly lighted. She did not see
any one around the store or on the porch.
Hutton and Morris had testified that they
were sitting there about 9 o'clock waiting
for the "town party" to make final prep
arations for the lynching. '-,
Spencer said he would flght such wrongs"
out where they were given, even If in the
court or in heaven. The court reprimand
ed both Raker and Spencer in severe lan
guage, and himself came in for a severe
castigation by them.
The court ordered the Sheriff , to take
Raker to jail until this afternoon. Ex
planations followed, Raker apologizing to
the court. Post made the amende hon
orable to counsel for the defense and ex
pressed his unwillingness to use at any
time language unbecoming a gentleman.
The court accepted the . apologies all
around. ' â¢
Orders Baker to Jail.
The court asked Raker why he could
not be as affable and pleasant in court
as he appeared in private life, and Spen
cer answered for his associate, saying
Raker was a man and could- not stand the
abuse heaped upon him by the court and
counsel for the prosecution. It was then
that the court advised opposing counsel
to get their guns and fight it out on the
street, as he would do if he were insulted
in the presence of a lady.
The strife began when Raker's "edu
cational" questions, put to Mrs. Richard
Nichols, were objected to by Assistant
Attorney General Post. Raker excitedly
accused Post of falsifying, and Post
termed Raker's remark "hot air."
"If I were insulted in the presence of a
lady (a woman witness was on the stand)
I would soon wipe out the Insult," said
the court. If you were men you would go
outside and fight Â¦ out."
ALTURAS, Feb. 7.â But for the plentl
tude of disgraceful rows to-day's proceed
ings in the trial of James W. Brown, the
alleged lyncher, would have been feature
less. One of the most vicious of these
court-room embroglios occurred during
the morning session and afforded an op
portunity for Judge Harrington to repeat
his remark of several days ago â that the
opposing counsel should leave the court
room and settle their differences with pis
tols. This time he went further. .

VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. 7.âConsider
able anxiety is being felt here regarding
H. M. S. Egeria, Captain Simpson; which
sailed for the west coast of Vancouver
Island to search for the lost sloop of war
Condor. The Queen 'City arrived in port
last night and reported that nothing had
been seen or -heard of the Egeria, either
on the coast or at any of the ports at
which the Queen City called. Local navi
gators who are acquainted with Captain
Bimpson fear that sojme^ misfortune has
befallen the Egeria, as Captain Simpson
never before made a voyage to the west
coast and was unacquainted with the
waters . along the dangerous shore line.
It is regarded as most peculiar that the
Queen City heard nothing* of the Egerin,
but there Is a possibility that the' latter
may have left the coast and proceeded
out to sea in the hope of running across
the missing Condor. ., , Â¦
ANXIETY OVER THE EGERIA.
VICTORIA, B. C.-Feb. 7.â The United
States revenue cutter Grant is now fifteen
days out on her cruise in search for
wreckage of the mieslng sloop of war
Condor, and her arrival is expected at
any timei When she returns some ques
tions may be asked regarding complaints
that have reached here from Uclu.let and
other rancherias of the west coast of
Vancouver Island. If these stories lrom
the island coast be trueâ and those from
Uclulet are supported by affidavitsâ some
of the officers of the revenue cutter have
been trading gaudy colored prints, clothes 1
and other merchandise with the Indians
for totems, curios and money.
One of the revenue cutter's firemen is
accused of having sold whisky to Indians
of the Uclulet reservation.
Another story from this village is that
some of the crew of the Grant entered
the house of Indians on the reservation
when the residents were absent and took
a dancing head dress, which was much
prized by the tribe. â¢ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
Two Indians, Ernest and Robert of
Uclulet, have made affidavit that each
bought from a short man, believed to be
a fireman, a bottle of whisky, for which
one paid $2 and the other $1 50. They
say that the man who sold the whisky
had more bottles- hidden among the coals.
As for the complaints made that t7ie
vessel was trading, little seems to have
been done other, than to exchange a pair
of trousers, some yards of highly colored
cloth or print, or similar articles wfih
the Indians in return for Indian curios.

CUTTER'S CREW
AFTER CURIOS
"Mrs. Hutchinson was not feeling very
well and she decided to take a trip for her
health. At one time Mrs. Hutchinson was
quite wealthy, but of late years she lost
her fortune in various speculations. She
still had a comfortable Income from New
York. She -was very well educated. -1
know of no reason why she should commit
suicide, but she was morbid at times and
brooded over her financial troubles."
Madame Germain, , a palmist, who lives
in the same house with Mrs. Blackmore,
knew Mrs. Hutchinson very well. She
said: Â»
Friends of Mrs. Hutchinson in this city
have little doubt that she committed sui
cide by jumping off the steamship State
of -California. For some time prior to her
departure from the city Mrs. Hutchinson
had been laboring under an Intense men
tal strain, due, some say, to the loss of
considerable property she owned in the
East. She was a widow and lived in a
rooming-house on Mission street, just be
low Sixth. A day or so before she left the
city she gave up her. rooms and sent her
furniture, clothing, jewelry, etc., to some
relatives in Alameda". She took nothing
with her on the steamer but a valise, and
when she left she told Mrs. C. Blackmore,
who lives at 906 Market street, that she
was going on a short trip to get a much
needed rest. She had been ailing for the
last two months and her nervous system
was sorely taxed. Mrs. Blackmore was
prostrated last night when told of her
friend's fate. Â¦ ., â¢ ,. â.-..... .. . ... . .
Mrs. Hutchinson's Suicide.
One Cause That May Have Led to
MET FINANCIAL REVERSES,
Mrs. Hutchinson wore a' large diamond
ring and a gold chain. These were not
found in her stateroom.; Among the pas
sengers the conviction is general that the
woman committed suicide by Jumping
overboard. â¢ â¢ â¢
Mrs. Hutchinson is known to have been
on board at midnight on Wednesday, but
she has not been seen since. Her ab
sence was noticed just after the State of
California left Santa Barbara and her
stateroom was broken into. Her effects
were all there and two notes were found,
one addressed to the captain and the
other to "Mabel."- In the note to the
captain was a $10 gold piece, with the re
quest that the money be used in tele
graphing to her friends.. The captain has
not made public the further contents uf
the' note and he still has the one ad
dressed to. "Mabel."
When the State of California left San
Francisco she had as a passenger Mrs.
Hutchinson. a woman about 40 years ot
age, who was well dressed and wore gold
spectacles and who seemed to be In great
mental distress. She evidently was ex
pecting some one to come aboard at some
point below San Francisco and kept in
her stateroom, where the stewardess was
in almost constant attendance upon her.

ST. LOUIS. Feb. 7.â Director of Exhibits
Frederick J. V. Skiff has conceived a com
panion scheme for the dirigible balloon

sent the republic in the great historical
event. Never before, except on an er
rand of war, has a French regiment *et
foot on American soil. Director Skiff
thinks that. the presence of a French regi
ment in this city celebrating the greatest:
instance of territorial expansion in lÂ»is
tory would be most seemly and appro
priate. France and America, united in
history and sentiment in more ways than
one, and an American regiment escorting
a French regiment through the exposition

tion the world over. v : -> X

Mr. Wilmerding was a good citizen, an hon

who came within its influence to become good
citizens and upright men. And If your ex

The fact that ', you have taken a course of
instruction here will not insure your success
after you leave here. You will have a great
advantage over' the young man who has not
had the training and Instruction and associa
tion which you have enjoyed here, but whether
you shall achieve success in lifo will depend
upon the showing you make lifter you engage
in the trade which you- may learn while here.
In other words, will depend upon yourselves.
If you make good use or the moral and mental

to find without aid from others the path which
leads to success. He had honesty, industry
and intelligence, â¢ and although these I consti
tuted his only capital, -we shall see. that to
them is to be attributed the success which he
achieved. And any boy who possesses these
attributes can accomplish as great â¢ success as
Mr. Wllmerdins did. ... . . â¢
He was born in the State of New Y6rk in
1831. He received an ordinary education, leav

without means. He had no trade or profession.,
nor the money or influence to. obtain one. He
was situated as many boys are who are com-
Keceived Ordinary Education.
I have been asked to say a few words to you
about Mr. Wilmerding, the founder of this In
stitution, and to tell you why he provided the
money to endow it. There is really not much
to be said about llr. "Wiimerding. He was a
quiet, reserved man with. a. big heart, and gen
erous impulses, but one who shrunk instlnc
tivtly from everything approaching show or
ostentation. He. could not tolerate flattery,
and knowing how distasteful everything' In the
nature, of flattery was to/him. I shall be care
ful not to indulge in any fulsome praise in
the few words which I shall say to you about
him.
Happily, we have with us to-day the 'man
Â¦who wrote thofc words at Mr. Wilmerdlng's
dictation. We have asked him to come here
and talk to us, because we can; feel that he is
reflecting to us something of Mr. WllmÂ»-rdingr's

Horace M. Wild," a well-known baseball
player, died tlfis morning at his home,
1008 Tenth avenue, from the results of an
injury received six years -ago while in
dulging In his favorite pastime. He was
struck on the head with a baseball, the
effect of which never passed away and
finally brought death to him.
The game at which Wild received the
fatal blow was being played in San Fran
cisco. He was struck accidentally on the
left side of the head while preparing to
take his place at the bat. The- pain did
not annoy him much and he paid, little
attention, to it, although it recurred occa
sionally. .
Until six months ago Wild Was not se
riously troubled with the pains. . Then,
when he began to suffer considerably, he
consulted a physician. He was advised to
so to a hospital, -which he did, but' got no
relief, the pains seeming to increase. Fi
nally he lost the sight of both eyes, the
pressure having destroyed the optic nerve.
This was followed by complete paralysis
of the body. The doctors then declared
that he had progressive paralysis, result
ing from a. blow on the head, and that he
could not recover. . . . . â¢

' II Thomas Post - will hold j solemn
I -funeral- services to-morrow after
â¢ JJL noon over the body of .their late
; comrade, Dr. -Hayes. Clifton
French, who died last .Wednesday. The
deceased was a prominent member of the
post,' and was also oneof the. best known
citizens in the city, having resided in the
Mission for over twenty years. . i
I In 18S7 Dr. French, was elected surgeon
of the post. He also held a similar posi
tion in the. Veteran Guard, G. A. R. Â» Â¦'
When, the Civil War broke^ out Dr.
French enlisted at Ypsilanti, Mich., In
Company E, Seventeenth Michigan Infan
try. .He fought in "the. battles of South.
Mountain and was in the severe-engage
ment at Antietam. Dr. French has a
father living in Cleveland. Ohio, who; la'
now 93 years of age. - .The deceased leaves
a wife, and "two children, -the eldest of
whom is now visiting friends, in Japan.
' Interment -will be in, the family plat at
Laurel Hill Cemetery. . ... . .
According to â¢ this -woman General Her
rera sent word to: the Government gen
eral, Castro, to Surrender. The latter an
swered that he had been sent out to fight
and was ready to do so.
The plans s of the revolutionists indicate
their intention .to attack Panama-, but
they are undoubtedly awaiting reinforce
ments. The only fighting, so far has" been
between two exploring parties in the vi.
clnltyof Tonosi, where the revolutionists
landed.' - Â¦ Â¦. _ .- .* .
General Herrera proposed that the Con
suls addressed ask their respective gov
ernments to declare the- line of the Pan
ama-Colon Railroad to be neutral ground
within which the Government should not
build entrenchments or the Liberals Â¦ at
tack, and that only. a police force be left
to guard the line. General Herrera said
he proposed, if possible, to compel the
Government to attack the Liberal : forces/
and that the Liberals had a strong fleet
and army -provided with cannon, etc.
General Herrera also declared in his note
that the Liberals considered the capture
of Panama and Colon : to be absolutely
necessary for the development of their
military plans; that they would act to
obtain, such results, and that in due time
they would notify the Consuls of p such
proposed action, allowing twenty
four hours for foreigners to take ref
uge at a. place of safety to be agreed upon
with the Consuls,, and that the point so
selected should not be fired upon. , â¢ :
COLON, Colombia, -Feb., 7.â The wife of
a Government soldier who . was made a
prisoner by the rebels last month and
who managed to escape .from General
Herrera's command, arrived, at Panama
last night. She. reports that- the Liberal
forces, to the number of 1500 men, are
encamped from <, Penono-Ue to Chame
(about seventy , miles < southwest of Pan
ama), and that General Herrera and his
staff are at Chame. :â¢: '
The note from General Herrera was ad
dressed to the American, French, British
and German Consuls here. In it General
Herrera declared, among other things,
that the government of Senor . Maroquin,
the President of Colombia, was not law
ful, and that therefore the rebels, al
though deploring the bloody,results of the
war, would fight to the end- for ; the ulti
mate' suecess of the LiberaL'principles..
A conference of the Consuls was held.
'PANAMA, Colombia, Feb. 7.â Colonel
Jullen del Castillo, an envoy from Gen
eral . Herrera, the insurgent commander,
arrived' here last night escorted by po
lice and left Panama at 10 o'clock. Gov

from Colonel del Castillo for himself and

Â¦WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â The Senati
Committee on the Philippines to-day con.
tinued Its consideration of the revenue o;
the Philippine' Islands. Governor Taft be
ing still on the stand."
Taft began his statement with an expla
nation of that portion of his testimony ol Â»
yesterday to the effect that sentiment waj
the main reason for asking a substantial
reduction of the rates of the Dingley law
so far as they apply to the Philippines,
saying he feared that the statement mlgh,
be misunderstood. The idea he had meant
1 te convey .by that statement was that tht
Philippine Commission welcomes ever>
evidence of a desire on the part of tht
American people to aid the Philippine peo
ple, and he believed that any such evl
dence of discrimination would aid the
Philippine administration In its work.
That in time such a concession a3 was
proposed would be of vast benefit to the
farmers of the islands-and practically al
the inhabitants are farmersâ he did no
doubt. He was sure the political effec!
would be good, but that there would be
any immediate substantial effect. he did
not think was true, regardless of tht
statement made in his official report thai
such a change would cause an advance u
trade by "leaps and bounds. He did not
mean to withdraw the recommendation
on the contrary, he would be glad to havt
a reduction of 50 per cent. A \* Â¥ *.
Governor Taft also explained that hÂ«
had not intended to convey the idea that
the 65,000,000 acres of land in the Philip
pines not controlled by private ownershir
is arable. Much of the area Is, he saiu.
covered by mountain ranges, and is nol
therefore capable of cultivation.
In response to a suggestion from Sen
ator Culberson, Governor Taft said he
did not thin~ the âU providing a tariQ
between the United states and tne Philip
pines should be temporary, as Is the casÂ«
with reference to the Porto Â«ican bill.
Speaking of the new revenue bill passed
by the Philippine Commission, he saio
that so far the effect is conjectural, but
that it was hoped the amount under the
impetus it would give to the trade would
soon equal the returns secured under the
old laws, which was $9,000,000 or $10,000,000.
There had. so far been a great increase in
the importation" or food products, especial,
ly canned goods, which principally came
from the United States.
Governor Taft next explained the con
tracts which have been let for harbor im
provements, involving- an expenditure ol
J3.000.000. In response to questions bj
Hale he said that contracts also had been
let for the construction of twenty
launches, or small sea-going boats, for the
transportation of mall and of provincial
officers. The cost of these boats would
be $1,000,000. He had asked for bids f rone
San Francisco, he said, but they were sc
high the commission was obliged to con
tract for them with Shanghai firms.
Governor Taft asked for power to pass
general corporation laws. Most of the en
terprises there now, he explained, arÂ«
controlled "by English -capitalists. Dubois
wanted to know if it would not be ad
vantageous to the : Government to build
and control railroads, telephones, etc.
"That is a question for economic consid
eration," answered Governor Taft, "whlcfc
the commission wishes to avoid." .
Reverting 1 to the subject of corporations,
Governor Taft thought it would be wlsn
for Congress to give to the commissior
some discretionary power in the mattei
of the building of railroads.

The demand for tickets for the carnival
has been much greater than last year.
There were more tickets sold yesterday
than were sold on the corresponding day
last year.
Ttie procession will probably be one of
the grandest ever seen at a Mardi Gras
ball in this city. Particular care will be
taken to arrange the more beautiful and
artistically dressed characters in such a
position In the line as to give the gay
Vae^ant a glittering effect.
James W. Byrne, chairman of the ex
ecutive committee. Is taking a great In
terest In the preliminary preparations for
the fete. One innovation which he has
introduced will be the decorating: of the
outside of the building with gayly colored
electric globes. These lights will be vis
ible from almost every quarter of the
city. The lights are similar to those used
In all the big Parisian fetes and were pur
chased especially for the occasion by
Byrne during a recent trip to Paris.
Two full orchestras will be on hand to
dispense music The music will be under
tha direction of Herman Heyman, who
has secured the services of Gerald Barton
to write the score for the court festivities.
Members of the Bohemian Club will fur
nish the chorus. Calcium lights will be
used while the carnival procession Is
moving from the library, where it will
form, to the main ballroom.
Exceptionally lavish preparations are
being made for the Mardi Gras ball which
will be given next Tuesday night at the
Hopkins Institute of Art. For the past
three days a score of electricians and dec
orators have been at work on the Interior
of the institute building festooning: the
walls with evergreens interspersed with
various colored. Incandescent lights. Some
of the costly pictures still occupy their
allotted places on the walls of the gal
leries, but the most of the works of art
have given way to bunches of myrtle,
Christmas trees and bunting.
The Searles gallery, where Prince Car
nival and his court will hold forth, is
decorated in an artistic way. The house
gallery is beautifully decorated with Cni

The fire broke out at 4 o'clock In the hair

and spread so rapidly that the employes
on the second floor and in Superintendent
Studer's office barely escaped, many be

If reform is to come it must come from out
side of the spbere of political Influence. If the
boss Is a' power under present conditions, what
would be his power If he was -put at the head
of.- eay. a Government bureau of railroads ?
Government Â¦ ownership of railroads,' without a
civil service qualification, would mean an ex
tinction of all presonal freedom. What applies
In this day of wireless telegraphs, wireless
telephones and wireless conventions we should
be glad that we have a wireless President.
Efficiency should apply to heads of departments
as well as to subordinates. .We should not stop
until every business official. Is placed on the
civil service list.. It Is the duty of a woman's
club to devote Its energies. to the extension of
the merit system. The success of our Post
office Department Is due to civil service and it
would be Improved if ail the fourth-class Post
masters were named under this rule.
Water Is a pretty good adjunct to civil serv
ice reform, particularly in politics. I suppose
the clubs throughout the State have been pur
suing the work in eradicating the malevolent
Influences that devastate our democratic mis
rule. The various Presidents of the United
States have increased the number of civil serv
ice employes from 13,000 to 78,000. But this is
not enough. We must still be alert and active
to keep up the fight. ' â¢ ' ~ :' : "

A colored women's clubs to the
/\\ General Federation of Women's
yfi\ Clubs went down to defeat yes
terday at the final meeting of the
State Federation of Women's Clubs at
Golden Gate HalL While the resolution
around which they rallied their forces
contained no reference to the color ques
tion, still it was generally understood
that the question of reorganization,
either by State lines or by individual
clubs, was the basis of this issue.
The question came up on a motion to
instruct the delegates elected to the gen
eral biennial convention to vote for any
plan that did not include Individual club
recognition. The matter was deftly and
delicately handled, and on the ground
that it would be discourteous to Califor
nia's guests to have her delegates pledged
to any preconcerted action before the as
sembling of the convention, a vote was
taken and tho delegates will go unin
etructed.
The morning session was opened by
Mrs. Edwin C. Southworth of Banger,
who presented the report - of the bureau
of reciprocity. The chairman reported
that 190 letters had been received, 225
written, 26 clubs were furnished with ar
ticles and 23 clubs contributed papers
which passed through the bureau for the
use of other clubs. Her associates on the
committee were: ,. t . . . ...

ground of jcourtesy. ;Â¦ : -

which .was overwhelmingly lost, only one-
Vote Is Decisive.
' 'Mrs.- Burdette / took the :floor to oppose
the motion to instruct on the ground of
courtesy to the coming guests and also on
the- ground that the reorganization and
color Uine questions were being* settled in
New York by a committee/and that prob
ably before the biennial was held a plan
satisfactory., to both' Massachusetts and
Georgia, the opposing factions, would be
agreed ' upon. v She. based her further ob
jection on the ground of 'courtesy.
Mrs. Curtis explained why she favored
the resolution to instruct delegates, "for
the reason that no political party would
send out its candidates for offices without
a platform and our representatives should
know how. the representatives of the clubs
felt on the question." t
Mrs. Strickland Clark of Los Angeles
made an argument against instructing the
delegates. -Mrs. Chapin and Mrs. Stilson
followed on the same line.' .
Shall not the great federation of California
repose sufficient confidence in tho wisdom of Its
delegates? Are we as hostesses justified in pre
judging 1 the action of the biennial by express-
Ing an opinion on this point? I am in favor of
reorganization, but I am opposed to Instruction.
Mrs. Bradley of Palo Alto said she
agreed with the previous speaker.
Â¦ Mrs. Porter of Los Angeles opposed it
on the ground that the question. was not
so important as some people were trying
to make it. She said: , ;
Mrs. M. L. W. Curtis of Oakland Club
precipitated a debate upon the color line
question by proposing a resolution that
the delegates from the State Federation
to the General Federation biennial conven
tion, to be held in Los Angeles in May,
should be instructed to vote for reorgani
zation on State lines in preference to the
individual club plans, or in favor of any
compromise plan that would do away with
the latter plan. Mrs. Curtis, spoke briefly

Â¦ "Forestry" was the subject of a paper
read by Mrs. G. T. Greenleaf of Redlands.
Mrs. Greenleaf favored governmental su
pervision over the forest question, tree
planting. and tree preservation. She like
wise urged upon club women to use their
best endeavors to get trees planted wher
ever and whenever, practicable. "Forests
are .the bestt irrigation enterprises that'
the State can know," she said. "The
preservation of \ the trees is necessary to
the preservation of the State." A special
plea was made for the preservation of the
big tree groves throughout the State.
Mrs. J. G. Lemmon of Oakland reported
for the committee on forestry. Mrs. Lem
mon stated that the efforts of the com
mittee had been- directed to the dissem
ination of literature looking to forest
preservation. Many books and pamphlets
were sent out and a larg;e number of tree
seeds were distributed. She urged the
women of the clubs to commence with
tree planting in their towns and gradual
ly extend the work and take more inter
est in Arbor day. Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
President Burdette answered a large
number of questions that were deposited
In â¢ the "question box," all of which re

A slight breeze was created when Mrs

bers of, the credential committee said tnat
on the report of the treasurer of the
club the club was only entitled to
three delegates and that they had
dropped the fourth. This proved to be
Mrs. Edinger. The matter was settled by
the recognition of Mrs. Edinger.
Mrs. Luther Scroggs of Nome, who
teaches tho most northerly school on the.

Alford said no blame for the murder at
tached to the labor unions because of the
fact that Rice was a "scab" and that
he was killed during the. strike. He
thanked God Buckley was no union man
to disgrace an organization which de
signed to protect rather than injure la
boring men. That Rice was the victim
o< a conspiracy the speaker said was cer
tain, and that Buckley committed the
deed there could be no question. He
therefore demanded a verdict of guilty.

the verdict of guilty of murder In .the

closed the argument with a brief resume
of the evidence, all of which he declared
pointed to the guilt of the prisoner at
the bar. He reviewed the points made
by the attorneys for the defense and
pointed out what he termed the "falla
cies" Â«of their contentions. The fact that
little Erline Platt was mistaken as to
having been at school on the day previous
to that on which the murder wa3 com
mitted could not possibly affect her posi
tive recognition of Buckley as the assas
sin, a Â¦ circumstance based on the facts
that he had ridden on the same car wltn
her and that she had watched him closely
en route to Twentieth street.
Prosecution Closes Its Argument-
In closing Attorney Ferral dwelt upon
the lack of motive for the crime and the
fact that Buckley carried no weapon at
the time of his arrest. Notwithstanding
every effort of the police, the weapon with
which Rice was slain was never found.
Ferral spoke of Buckley as a "hard work
ing boy," whose innocence was clearly
established, and he implored the jury to
acquit him and thereby spare his young
life and ease the agony of his aged and
heartbroken mother.
wholly. Many a man innocent of crime,
arrested under circumstances wnlcn
pointed darkly at him as the offender,
wildly evaded the truth. Buckley was in
the company of the assassin and he
feared the consequences. Was it to be
wondered at that he should seek to
screen hlmseli .' Yet. when he had time
to reflect, Buckley told the truth, and he
adhered to it throughout the trial.
FOUR CHILDREN
PERISH IN FIRE
The testimony of the witnesses for the
prosecution was reviewed at length. The
Inconsistencies of various ' statements
were pointed out. One witness said there
was considerable smoke after the shoot
ing and he was unable to see things
plainly. Yet several others asserted that
they observed every, detail of the tragedy
with clearness. . How could all this be
reconciled with the facts? That Buckley
told an untruth in his excitement follow
ing his arrest was not, according to Fer
ral, a fact that should condemn him

In'a prettily worded speech, full of the
kindliest expressions for the | pleasant
two years she had passed in the office of
president, Mrs. Burdette gave up her of
fice and gavel to Mrs. Bulkley, who made
a brief speech of Â¦' thanks .for the honor

dered three, vocal solos, "Mignon Lied "

by Miss Fannie "Â¦ Danforth. :Â¦-,â¢
The police next claimed the attention
of the attorney. Sergeant Duke was de
scribed as the "Sherlock Holmes" of the
local "force â a man who wrote out dyins
statements, incorporating such facts as
might be of profit to the prosecution and
eliminating such as might benefit the ac
cused. A dying statement prepared and
signed under circumstances . such as in
volved the signing of the Rice statement
had absolutely no value. There was no
doubt Rice was brutally clubbed into in
sensibility prior to the shooting, and yst
thaffact was not mentioned In the state
ment prepared by Duke. Was it possible
that a man dazed by a number of blows
could tell the color of a man's hat when
shot a moment later? Could he tell the
height of his assailant, or observe that
he was smooth shaven or otherwise? The
statement, in the opinion' of Ferral, was
absurd and utterly unworthy of credence
by. sensible men. v
Inconsistent Statements Reviewed.
Attorney. Ferral related several anec
dotes illustrative of his theme In a witty,
eloquent, â¢ forceful . and ' earnest manner.
He sought to arouse, the sympathies of
the jury by picturing the defendant as a
young man- whose soul was in peril and
who was menaced by a horrible doom be
cause of some damaging circumstances
which connected him with the murder of
George Rice. Â¦ These damaging facts had
been made much of by the prosecution,
and the speaker begged the jury not to
be swayed in their judgment by the so
phistries real eloquence knows so well
now to advance as incontrovertible facts.
The facts that Buckley was out of em
ployment during the strike and that Rice
was known to be a "scab" machinist did
not argue that Buckley killed Rice. Buck
ley was not a union man, and even if he
were that would not alter the circum
stances of the case. 'The speaker can
didly admitted that It was a trick of tha
lawyer's trade to frequently harp upon
inconsequential details and to present
them In the most favorable light, or vice
versa. He regretted, however, that this
had been done by the prosecution in a
case where a human life was at stake.
Ferral Appeals to Jury.
When the verdict was read by Foreman
Charles Guillett the prisoner's face un
derwent no change. A deep silence pre
vailed for a moment oniy, to be broken
by the bitter sobbing of the aged mother
'Â«Â£ the convicted assassin, who had at
tended throughout the long trial. When
she sought to -condole with him he" re
pulsed her savagely and gazed sullenly
at the men who had pronounced his
doom. He listened nonchalantly- to the
court as the order setting next Saturday
as the time for pronouncing Judgment
was made. At that time a motion for a
new. trial will be argued. Buckley was
then taken to his cell in the City Prison.
Intense Interest has been shown in the
trial from the beginning by members of
various labor organizations, for the rea
son doubtless that Rice was a non-union
machinist. The murder was one of many
crimes committed during the recent strike
and popular interest In the outcome was
centered upon the trial in consequence.
The closing argument for the defense
was made by Attorney Robert Ferral at
the morning session of 'court. Attorney
fc'erral said he believed his cause was the
right one and he had absolute confidence
in the strength of his client's case. He
complimented counsel upon its able pre
sentation of facts i brought out at the
trialâ the prosecution offering them deli
cately at the point of a rapier, and the
defense with sledgehammer blows. The
law presumed the defendant to be Inno
cent until proved to be guilty, and the
jury was admonished to remember their
oaths to maintain the law. ThÂ« speaker
thanked God "that we do not live in an
age where men are doomed to death
merely because of the gloomy appearance
of things in which they are involved."
He alluded to the terrible days in Eng
land when men were hanged for the most
trivial offenses. The theft of a loaf of
bread or handkerchief consigned the of
fender inevitably to the gallows. Even
William Penn, whose name was synony
mous of peace and love of humanity,
was, like Buckley, once tried for disturb
ing the peace and\if he. had been proved
guilty, he, too, might have- been hanged,
and Pennsylvania might never have been.

LETTER TO MOTHERS.
By Mrs. J. H. Haskins, of Chicago, 111.,
President Chicago Arcade Olub.
Comforting .Words to Women Regarding Childbirth.
All who are at all familiar with social life at the southside of Chicago
know well the Arcade Club, and will tell you that it is one of the largest and
most influential clubs in Chicago. It can be readily understood, therefore,
that such a prominent woman as the head of this club could have only one
object in view in allowing her portrait and letter to be published in connection
with any medicine, and that is, to do good to other suffering mothers. Well
does Mrs. Haskins know that there are thousands of women who dread the
period of childbirth ; thousands who are prostrated nigh unto death at the
birth of each child, and for months afterwards are weak and "miserable, and
almost courting death as a relief from suffering.
A capable mother must bÂ© a healthy mother. The experience
of maternity should not be approached -without careful physical
preparation. . Care and. careful counsel is what the expectant and
wouldrbe mother needs; and. this counsel she can secure without
cost by. -writing to Mrs. Pinkham at Lynn, Mass.
Thousands and thousands of women have been carried through thts trying
ordeal safely and comfortably by a faithful reliance upon Ijydia E. IÂ»ink-
ham's Vegetable Compound, and Mrs. Haskins generously loans na her
name and portrait to help us to convince all skeptical women that health and
happiness abounds in Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
JMRS.X H. HASKINS,
President Chicago Arcade Club, Chicago, BL
tt Deah Mrs. Ptxkham : â Mothers need not dread childbearrng af-
ter they know the .value of Iiydia-E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound. While. I loved children I dreaded the ordeal, for it left me
weak and sick for months after, and at the tiroe I thougnt death was a
welcome relief ;. but before my last child was born a good neighbor ad-
vised me to try Xydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, and I
used that, together with your Pills and Sanative Wash for four months
before the child's birth ;â it brought me wonderful relief. I hardly had
an ache or pain, and when the child was ten days old I left my bed
strong in health and happy in mind. Every spring and fall I now take
a bottle of I^ydia E.< Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and find it
keeps mo in continual excellent health ; $2 or 83 a year keeps me well
and strong."â Mrs. J. H. Hasktks, 3248 Indiana Ave., Chicago, I1L

"Pear Mrs. Pdtkham : â I cannot thank you enough for what you have
done for ma. I wrote you some time ago about not being able to go my full
time during pregnancy. Now, after taking the treatment yoÂ«j advised, we
have a dear little girl baby, the joy of our home. I tell my friends she is a
Pinkham baby, for had it not been for Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound we never could have had her. My health is good, thanks

manner and chatted freely with him,
mainly on tho friendship between the
United States and Great Britain. Hia
Majesty especially referred to the close
connection between the Industries of the
two countries and the "friendship "existing
between the workingmen on both sides of

To a correspondent Schwab said: . i
"Air I can say" is that I had a most en

charming recollections of King Edward."
It was learned by the correspondent
that the King displayed keen interest in
and knowledge of the Industrial condi-
tiona of the United Stat?s..and evinced
nothing but the most kindly sentiment to
vrard that progress which American busi
ness Is making In Great Britain. .
The conversation, which was quite in
formal, touched on a variety of topics,
throughout which his Majesty's cordial
ity toward Americans and their Institu
tions was strikingly apparent. Schwab
said his European trip had been nurely
for treasure and as such had been emi
nently successful.
During his tour of Europe Schwab wa3
received in audience by three.monarchs,
and he everywhere noticed a palpable de
sire to maintain and strengthen the
friendly relations with America.

The statements of the gentleman are â¢ undoubtedly

of the act of Pennoyer of Oregon refusing to go' to
the frontier of the State to welcome President Harri
son. It is a refusal to recognize the courtesies and
the, hospitalities of life, and it has already; brought
down upon the head of the offender tne righteous
wrath of -everybody in New York who wishes to give
Prince Henry the grandest time he ever had in his
life or will ever have: again unless he should decide
to make another trip and come to California. â¢
.Of course some, way /will be found to overcome the
By way of giving emphasis to his refusal to give
up his box the uncompliant gentleman said to those
who questioned him: v "Prince Henry? Who is he,
anyway? He's only a snipâ a little snip of royalty.
I do not know what has come over us when we make
such an idiotic fuss over a Prince. President Roose
velt comes' here and is received just like one of the
rest of us. Why, I call him 'Teddy' myself. No
royal box for him."
To arrange the fete at the opera it was necessary
to assign to the Prince and his suite five boxes in the
grand tier. Now these boxe6 belong to private par
ties who are stockholders in the opera-house and
contributors to the guarantee fund. Four of them
promptly , consented to donate their boxes for the
occasion. The fifth man refused. He declared him
self averse to doing any kind of kow-tow to Princes,
and maintained that there is no reason why New
York should get excited over the royal visitor. :
Hardly had the bright bubble of fancy been blown
by the committee of arrangements, however, before
it was punctured by a remorseless wretch who. has
more logic than courtesy and who makes the eternal
verities an excuse for refusing to take part in those
conventionalities that make it possible to display dig
nity and decorum in this beastly world.
AMONG the fetes proposed for the reception of
Prince Henry in New York was a gala night
at the grand opera. All the famous songsters
of the great troupe were to be grouped into one
superb cast and no expense was to be spared to make
the spectacle one of a beauty and â¢"â¢ magnificence
never surpassed in any theater. Even at that, how
ever, the show on the stage was to be less brilliant
than the show in the boxes. New York was to out
do itself, and the splendor of .feminine, loveliness
gleaming with jewels was to impress the Prince with
the truth that no imperial court can rival democracy
when democracy cho'oses to do itself proud.
A MAN WHO KICKS.
The issue is one of serious concern tu all who own
property along the water front or on. the bay. In a
city of this kind it is- almost as important to patrol
the bay as to patrol the city. It is quite evident that
so long as thieves can approach from the water, out
of sight of ' police or watchmen, there can be very
little chance of detecting them. Police boats are,
then, a necessity of the situation. Provision. for such
patrol should be made at once, or, if that be impos
sible, then certainly the provision should be made
when the next appropriation is prepared for the Po
lice Department. There ought to be .no question
about the _ matter. ; In fact, the patrol boats should
have been supplied'long ago.
In commenting upon the burglary Chief of Police
Wittman said to a representative of The Call that it
was but another demonstration of the urgent need
'of a police boat for patrolling the bay.' He went on
to", say: "Every other large' city with a water front
has one or more launches or other craft and the.front
is regularly and systematically patrolled. In conse
quence trie. operations of bay or river pirates are ren
dered as difficult as the work of burglars elsewhere.
Here these 'rats' can do their work with slight dan
ger of being detected. My predecessors have urged
the necessity of a launch for bay patrol, but year
after year provision for it. has been omitted from the
tax levy. I shall strongly urge the purchase and
maintenance of a patrol boat and shall place it in ray
estimate of expenses of the department when the
time comes." : '
ANOTHER water-front burglary has been com
mitted under circumstances which justify the
conclusion than the burglars worked at their
ease and with comparatively little danger of detec
tion. This case is that of the* robbery of a cigar
store on Tuesday night." It appears the" burglars ap
proached the store in a boat and, working from be-'
neath, were safe from detection by any one on the
street above. The only way in which they could have
been observed would have been by some one passing
along'the water front in a boat. Such being the case,
one would suppose that the Police Department of
the city would have been long since provided with
boats sufficient for an effective water patrol to guard
against robberies, attempted in that way. It â¢ will,
therefore, be a matter of surprise to a good many
persons- to^ learn that the city has no such water
patrol and has never had.
The Sultan of Turkey is again, guilty of one of
those executive freaks which .make his admin
istration picturesque. He has condemned his
brother-in-law to death and urges him to return from
Paris to Constantinople to die. The brother-in-law
seems to have conscientious scruples against ac
cepting the invitation.

learn and many, improvements to beyroade, but it
seems clear that the worst years of the industry are
over, and that California is about to take her rightful
rjmk amor-2 the wine countries of \b.e world.
I An important feature of the. problem of making
markets for California wines is presented by Andrea
Sbarboro in a plea for a better supply of wine by
hotels at lower prices. After pointing out that the
consumption of California wine by the American peo
ple is increasing, he notes that there is room for im
provement, and adds: "The hotels and restaurants
should serve their patrons with wines at lower rates
lhan they now charge. When they, serve an ,excel
lent dinner for fifty cents it is absurd- to charge
Seventy-five cents or cne dollar for a bottle of wine."
While warnings such as these should be carefully
heeded, the present situation is sufficiently good to
incline many persons to be indifferent to them.
There is a strong demand for more wine. P. T. Mor
gan, president of the California Wine Association,
ssys: "Unless planting is prosecuted vigorously the
demand may outrun the supply and remunerative
markets for a California product may be .supplied
/rom other sources. There is very little danger of
<^\erplanting in dry wine counties. The production
:rnd consumption are to-day almost equal, and, be
yond the natural increase in consumption, the sup
plying the new countries acquired from Spain as a
result of the late war and the expanding markets of
the Orient will have to be looked after, as well as
Cuba, whose annexation to the United States can
< nly be a matter of a short time.*'
Charles Bundschu gives a similar warning against
the tendency to produce large quantities of cheap
wines, or wines at minimum prices, instead of higher
class wines. In the course of his contribution to the
Review he says: "When the ultimate aim of all the
great wine-producing countries is lost sight of in
order to give way exclusively to the handling of bulk
wines and to the crushing of grapes on the mechani
cal method of so many tons a day (distributing the
juice in giant vats without discrimination of growth,
origin and variety), then I predict that a serious step
toward the decadence of our wine industry has been
iaken, a step which is bound to injure sooner or later,
the fair reputation which we are all striving to build
up and succeed in establishing after almost a semi
century' of strife and struggle."
One of the 'dangers that threatens the new pros
perity of the industry is that a proper care may not
be taken to keep up and advance the quality of Cali
fornia wines. Charles F. Oldham, who has made an
extensive study of California wines with a view to
promoting their export to Great Britain, says in an
article contributed to the Review: "California has
of late years been acknowledged to be taking a place
as one of the few countries in the world where fine
dry wines 2s well as good ordinary wines can be and
are produced. If, however, in the replanting of vine
yards only common and heavy bearing varieties be
planted, the industry will in a few years fall back
again and be greatly discredited, and there will then
be a great scarcity of fine types of wine Just .as they
are beginning to be more known, appreciated and
bought after."
PACIFIC WINE AND SPIRIT REVIEW, in
its annual statistical edition just published,
makes not only a good showing for the wine
industry in the way of statistics but gives also state
ments of leading wine men which present bright
prospects for the future. It appears that while there
was z. big shortage in the wine crop of 1901 the. lpgh;
prices paid for grapes more than balanced matters
so far as the producer was concerned. Moreover,
the conditions of the industry of late have been suf
ficiently good to encourage production. It is stated:
"Replanting is going on extensively throughout the
Slate, the greater portion of the vines being resistant
stock. There will probably be 8ooo or more acres
of new and replanted vines this year."
OUR WINE INDUSTRY.
The feature of these reports which is o"f most sig
nificance for us is the repetition in them of "South
ern" California: If the statements of the reports be
true the plan of -the colonization is not to procure
settlers for all California, but for a portion of the
State only. Of course whatever benefits any section
of the State is bound to be beneficial to the rest, but
for all that it behooves the people of Central and
Northern California to provide some means of making
known their own advantages and attractions for set
tlers. All people are not alike in their tastes, and
there may be many who after, seeing Southern Cali
fornia would "not like to settle there but might be
pleased' were they to see other sections of the State.
The issue is one that merits the attention of our pro
gressive men. j San Francisco should exert her lead
ership in this instance in making the fight for the
whole . State. The task woqld not, b,e: difficult. The
State Board of Trade is already organized td do the
work, and it needs only that cordial support be- given
to it. \\
The dispatch goes on to say: "It is announced
that within a short time' every, one of the thousand or
more agents will be at work throughout the States
east of the Mississippi River. From time to time
homeseekers' excursions will be run to the territories
mentioned, and special inducements will be made to
get people to visit the Southwest andvSoutherii Cali
fornia." :
According to the reports which come to us from
Chicago concerning the plan it is the purpose of the
men controlling the "Harriman lines," as they are
called, to provide occupants for millions of acres of
fertile and unoccupied lands in Western Louisiana,
Texas and Southern California. With that object,
it is said, they purpose to send into the Middle and
Eastern States upward ot iooo immigrant or coloni
zation agents ;to. work up the scheme. Concerning
the prospects <of the plan S. F. B. Morse, assistant
traffic manager of the Texas lines of the Southern
Pacific, is quoted by a' Chicago dispatch to the Phila
delphia Ledger as saying: ' "In the Southwest we
have ov<er three million acres of fertile land which
would make good homes for industrious people. We
believe that no section of the United States has a
more brilliant future than Texas and Western.Louisi
ana, and we are convinced that all that is necessary
is to let the public know what we have got."
OFFICIALS of the Southern Pacific, the
Union Pacific and their allied lines of . rail
way are reported to be engaged in perfecting
plans for accomplishing the largest colonization
scheme ever'attempted by Western roads. The aim
is to provide an increased business for the roads by
settling up the country tributary to them and devel
oping the rich resourcesof lands that are now lying
idle. 'Â¦'
A COLONIZATION SCHEME.
The rascally Count who deserted a young wife in
this city, eloped with another girl. practically a child
and is .now held at El, Paso under serious charges
seems to know better than his keepers what is good
for him. He wants to die. . . .Â¦'-.,'.
M. Waldeck-Rousseau admits the extreme obscur
ity" of the causes into which "Â¦investigation'' must/, be
made. We venture that an inquiry into the psychol
ogy of the question will reveal the operation of a nat
ural law that affects the fecundity of a people. We
think it will be found that families are. larger and 1
children less subject to infantile mortality among'
those races and nations where romance is the cause
and the purpose of marriage. We think it will be
found that where material considerations are second
ary as a reason for marriage the population increases
in number and in vigor and individuality, and in the
mass has a better command of subsistence, of the
means, of life, of things material, than where these are
made the primal motive.
The married relation is entered upon in a material
way. The settlement of a marriage portion, the con
tract for dower, the business outlook and prospect
of marriage resemble much the formation of a new
business .firm. Romance, which regards marriage as
the foundation of a family, takes a secondary place
or has no place at all in the proceeding.
It may be accepted as obvious that the French view
of the materialities of life and its practice have some
thing to do with the problem. A French wife is quite
commonly the working partner and business asso
ciate of her husband. She is not merely interested in
the housekeeping, but in the business which supports
the housekeeping. Her life has a different horizon
from the merely domestic. It is a commercial hori
zon. The materialities of ! existence^ obscure the ro
mance of life.
The. French argument that exaltation in civilization
is a cause is a melancholy appeal to. the pride of na
tionality. It means that the Gallic race immolates it
self on the altar of ultimate civilization and extin
guishes itself for the good of the world, leaving its
achievements its epitaph. The food supply can
hardly be a factor, for the vigor of natural resources
is far from exhausted. Emigration does not account
for thedecline, for the French are a home-keeping,
non-migrating race and are not found in great
numbers abroad, as are the Celts, Germans and
Scandinavians. As the French do not emigrate, so
France receives but few immigrants. New strains of
vitality are not felt in the blood of her people. An
outsider may speculate, while the' Parliamentary
Commission investigates. But if speculation and in-,
vestigation hit upon the same cause or causes, what
shall be the remedy?
Some French enthusiasts have held that decrease
in the birth rate, enabling the death rate, to overtake
and pass it, is a sign of high civilization, and as these
conditions exist only in France they testify that
French civilization has approximated the maximum.
There is a- measure of truth in this. The race . in
creases slowly or stands still at each extreme. - In
primitive conditions, such as the original state of our
American Indians 'and the present state of Eskimos,
increase and decrease, births and deaths, nearly baK
ance. The natural law of life is that its ebb and. flow
are* regulated first by the food ' supply and second
by the preponderance of sex. If nature desire toex
terminate any form of life it is accomplished by pro
ducing but one sex. We are not aware of the find
ings of biology in this respect, but it is highly prob
able that one element in the extinction of races- of
animals will be found to have been this preponder
ance of one sex..' \ . . . - ;
MWALDECK - ROUSSEAU, ' the Prime
Minister of France, in presiding over
â¢ the Parliamentary. Commission appointed
to investigate the cause of the depopulation of France
made some official statements of fact that will cause
widespread interest far beyond the borders of â¢ that
country. He declared that the statistics "of the last
fifty years show an excess of deaths over: births in
France. They also' show a progressive increase in
infant mortality. The Premier well said that the sub
ject presented a problem the most difficult and most
obscure and interesting in its elements that had ever
pressed upon the attention of a nation.

Then Mr. Ach got dov/n to the original
purchase of the paper and wanted to
know about the agreement to buy wh'ch

County Assessor Henry P. Dalton, who
Is accused by Mr. Collins of having a.a

PURCHASE OF THE PAPER.
Then a minute examination was mado
of the transactions by which the nominal
directors of the company secured their
stock. Mr. Daniels finally admitted that
A. L. Smith and L. S. Jordan each held
but one share of stock, the latter having
secured his from S. F. Daniels, the father
of the defendant, who was originally a di
rector, but is now dead. Both of these
shares of stock were deposited in the Cen
tral Bank together with his stock as se
curity for a loan of $53,000. These shares
of stock Mr. Daniels said he had caused
to be issued to the holders in order that
they might become directors, and that no
money was ever paid for these shares.
The Commissioner â Very well. I decline to
proceed further, that is all. Either I have got
to have the -evidence to report to the court
or I simply quit right here.
Mr. Ach â Well, the whole matter is prema

mit certain books to leave his custody should
not prevent the commissioner from going on
and taking the testimony.
And so Mr. Ach smoothed the troub'ec!
waters.

DANIELS' FINANCIAL STANDING
Mr. Ach made a minute and searching
examination of Mr. Daniels' . financial
standing at different times during his
business career to bring out facts in sup
port of the assertion that he was without
means .to make the purchase' of the En
quirer at the time of the transfer of that
paper to him in 189S. Mr. Daniels said
that he owned his home, which had a
mortgage thereort, and some of the stock
of his store, which store had been closed
and a small piece of land in Contra Costa
County.
From this they went to the question rt
Mr. Daniels' experience as a newspapor

The San Francisco Labor Council met
last evening and passed resolutions con

directors of the San Francisco Merchants'
Exchange and the San Francisco Cham

unrestricted entrance into the United
States of all merchants and members of
the mercantile class of China. The reso-

Mr. Ach â Counsel for the plaintiff

The Commissionerâ Well, that is all right.
Mr. Ach: Q. â Had you ever had any busi

ANSWER! CAUSES MERRIMENT.
The Commissioner â That Is when he was can

The Witnessâ This Is not the one. colonel;
this is not the gentleman. (Merriment.)
Then adjournment came with the inter
est Intense. â¢
The court holds that the Legislatura
may enact laws to protect life and health,
but cannot delegate legislative power to
the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. Under the act, it is said, three
factories might be in the same condition.
One man might not be visited by the
Commissioner, the second might be fitted
up at a trifling expense, while the third,
on the mere order of the official, might
be put to an expense of thousands of dol
lars in introducing apparatus of some
kind.
Robert Schaezlein, proprietor of a metal
polishing shop, was informed that his
employes were compelled to inhale dust,
filaments and injurious gases, and he was
therefore ordered to put in a suction pipe
to carry off the objectionable matter. Ho

neglect and disobedience of the authori

appealed and Schaezlein wins his conten

paratus when ordered to do so by the
Commissioner.
DEMAND AMERICAN CREWS,
"We only seek to deal with the com
mercial proposition," said Newhall, "and
feel that Congress will take care of the
coolie question."
A motion was then made that the reso
lution as presented by the board of di
rectors be referred back to that body,
with the request that the clause proposed
by Hugh Craig, barring out all coolie la
borers, be added to the resolution, and
that the resolution, with the additional
clause, be accepted by the meeting.
The motion prevailed and the meeting
adjourned.
George Newhall expressed himself In
positive terms as being opposed to coolie
labor and said that there was an evident
belief in the minds of some members that
the directors favored the admission of
the Chinese laborers.
The motion to vote on the resolution
by a postal card vote was opposed by
Andrew Carrigan, and the motion for a
postal card vote v/as lost.
Amended Resolution Adopted.
Thomas J. Clunie made a speech favor
ing 1 the total exclusion of the coolie
classes from this country. He deplored
the action of the meeting in voting down
the amendment presented by Craig and
said that it was an insult to the working
classes.
Craig attempted to speak again, but
was met with shouts of "shame" and he
took his seat.
"What you say ia not true. All that
President McNear said was that there
was certain kind of work in California
that white men could not do."
Craig at this point accused President
McNear of saying on the previous day
that -'the resolution was intended to al
low the ."coolie class to enter this coun
try to reclaim islands on the Sacramento
River. :â¢ > . ; , Â¦ â¢ . :
-President McNear answered: "The gen
tleman is making a statement that is not
true." . - Â¦,
:VYou made : that statement to me yes
terday on the floor of the exchange in
the presence of another member, T. J.
Clunie." retorted Craig.
Clunie jumped to his feet and excite
ment arose when he addressed Craig as
follows;
Craig Rebuked (fey Meeting.
The Craig amendment was voted down by
36 ayes to 42 noes: Fairfax- Whelan said
that the majority vote was far too small
to. stand as the expression of a body like
the Merchants" Exchange,, with its mem
bership of 46S. He moved that the entire
membership be. allowed . to. ,vote ,on the
resolution by a postal card vote.
When Hugh' Craig arose to. speak again
he was met with loud cries of "previous
question." Craig shouted that he would
keep the floor, all night, but that he-in
tended to express his views.
E. W. Hopkins, a director, of the ex
change, emphatically stated that the di
rectors were opposed to coolie labor and
had always expressed -.themselves so.

Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions
be forwarded to the President of the United
States, to the Representatives and Senators
from California in Congress, to the California
Commissioners at Washington. D C, and to
the press of San Francisco.
Resolved. That we earnestly invoke the im
nrediate action of all individuals Included in
the classes named by the Chamber of Com
merce and the Merchants' Exchange, i. e.. sales
men, clerks, buyers, bookkeepers, accountants,
managers, storekeepers, bankers and cashiers.
In order that the views of these classes may
be conveyed directly to their respective Rep
resentatives and Senators in Congress; and for
this purpose we request that each person so
concerned shall communicate his views by let
ter or postal at the earliest possible date.
Further , â¢ â¢ - â¢ ..
Resolved, That we hereby urgently call upon
our respective Representatives and Senators in
Congress to work and vote for the passage of
House bill No. 9330 and Senate bill No. 29GO to
the end that all classes of labor shall' be
equally and fully protected from a degrading
and hopeless competition with Chinese, Fur
ther
Resolved. That we regard the attitude of the
Chamber of Commerce and the Merchants' Ex
change as calculated to dereat all efforts at
effective Chinese exclusion, for the reason that
the classes which these bodies propose shall
be freely admitted to the United States are
preclsly those from whom the greatest danger
of competition is to be feared, and for the fur
ther reason that any attempt to exempt any
class from the operation of the Chinese ex
clusion law would vitiate the entire measure.
Further
Resolved, Ry fie San Francisco I,abor Coun
cil, in regular session assembled, that we con
demn the resolutions of these bodies as an act
of the grossest bad faith toward the people of
the State, as treachery toward the interests of
the State and nation and as absolutely inde
fensible upon any ground* further â¢
Whereas, The Chinese Exclusion Convention
held in San Francisco November 21 and 22.
1001, at Â¦which were representatives of all in
terests of the Stute â labor, agricultural, manu
facturing and commercial â unanimously de
clared in favor of the re-enactment of the ex
isting Chinese exclusion law, with the proviso
that, if possible, its terms should be made
more comprehensive and effective, and
Whereas, At the said convention the repre
sentative* of the mercantile interests were
unanimous in the expression that they, had
nothing to fear from an exclusion law. as de
monstrated by the maxim that "there Is no
sentiment in business": and by the fact that
the trade of the United States with China has
greatly increased during the ten years since
the Genry act became operative, which in
crease is now admitted by the resolutions of
the Chamber of Commerce and the Merchants'
Exchange, therofore ba It .
Whereas, | The ostensible reasons driven ' by
these bodies for their action Ss that the Chi
nese exeluoion measures now oendintc in Con
gress would. If enacted "be harmful to our
mercantile interests," and
Whereas, The board of trustees of the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce and the 'board
of director* of the' San Francisco Merchants'
Exchange have during the present week
adopted resolutions calllnsr upon the President
of the United States and the California delega
tion in Congress "to use their utmost efforts
to induce Congress to enact legislation so
as to grant the unrestricted entrance Into the
United States -to air merchants and members
of the mercantile class of China, such- as sales
men, clerks, buyers, bookkeepers, accountants,
managers, storekeepers, bankers and cashiers,"
and . .
lutlons adopted by the Labor Council fel
low:
Desire Trade of China.
President MdNear stated that as the
Kahn bill now before Congress meant the
absolute exclusion of the merchant class
of Chinese and as the" entire .world was
seeking the trade of China he felt that it
would be a fatal error .for thla country to
close the door to Chinese merchants, thus
affording China an opportunity to retali
ate by sending her trade to/other coun-
Lewis Gerstle moved to amend the reso
lution presented so that it would favor
the re-enactment -of the present Geary ex
clusion laws. The amendment of Mr.
Gerstle was put to a vote and defeated.
Hugh Craig moved to add to the resolu
tion, after the word "cashiers," the fol
lowing clause, "barring \inder;all circum
stances every class of coolie laborers."
The motion of Craig was the cause of
considerable oratory and heated discus
sion and the president had his hands
full in keeping the members in order by
use of the gaveL
Craig made a long speech In favor of
excluding all Chinese coolie labor. He
said that the organization should be most
careful in its expression on the exclusion
laws. He argued that the resolution as
presented meant an unrestricted admis
sion of all Chinese and that this meant a
menace to the working classes of this
country and to the rising generation.
The speaker then stated that China only
purchased goods from this country to the
extent of 6 cents per capita per annum,
while other countries purchased as much
as $15 per capita each year. He attacked
the resolution as presented and hoped
that his amendment would prevail.
Directors Oppose Coolie Labor.
R, P. Schwerin stated that the board of
directors only sought to show that it was
the desire of the business community to
secure bread commercial relations with
China and leave to Congress the question
of coolie labor.
"I resent Craig's . statements that the
directors want coolie labor to enter this
country."- said Schwerin. "The Kahn bill
takes care of that and it is impossible for
any coolie to enter this country as a
banker, clerk, broker, or business man un
der the present laws. The Kahn bill seeks
to prevent the admission of the merchant
class and all we seek is a broad commer
cial relation with China. We purposely
excluded the coolie proposition from the'
THE largest meeting of members
of the Merchants' Exchange wit
nessed fn many years took place
* yesterday afternoon when the
organization took action on the
resolution a<iopted by the board of direc
tors as to an expression toward the re
newal of the Chinese exclusion laws by
Congress.
The assembly room of the Merchants'
Exchange was crowded to the doors when
President George WJ McNear called the
meeting to order. Men representing great
wealth and of prominence in the commer
cial world were present and the greatest
interest was taken.iri the proceedings.
The preamble and resolution adopted
by the board of directors and which were
placed before the meeting for ratification
or rejfection w.ere'as follows:
Whereas, There are now pending In the
National Congress of the United States at
Washington certain bills which we believe may
be construed to SO' restrict the entrance' of the

that all facilities of .commerce and. the cour

pernicious efforts of the San Francisco Cham
ber of Commerce and the Merchants' Exchange
a ? d^u. f a11 lndlv 'duals and organizations In aid
of Chinese immigration, and. that we deem the
passage of the bill which has been approved
by the Pacific Coast delegation in Congress as
the only effective Impediment which will pre

this State by wanton' lawlessness and by de

Resolved, That we favor the strictest exclu

MANY spectators at a racetrack labor . under the im
pression that the only one and laborious trial of a
starter is the time engrossed In drawing his salary.
As a matter of fact,; the henpecked husband, with
his mother-in-law as v excess luggage, or, the conduc

easy time in comparlsoniwith -the-man who dispatches the
fields on a racetrack. v** 1 Â¦. ' r ;:
Of course the salary attached to the position is large,
dwarfing that of the esthetic bank clerk and probably thirteen
times the sum earned monthly by. the plodding hodcarrier; but
it is none too large, for no place on this terrestrial sphere is
so much kicking indulged in as -on a racecourse, r The insistent
female habitue who fools her husband and ."chips in" two bits
with her grand-stand neighbor .'and the dollar "piker" are the
worst foes encountered by a flag wielder.
Every time they lose a bet the start must of necessity have
been a bad one, and these penny wise Â¦Â¦Â¦ and pound foolish

The attention of the coursing enthu
siasts throughout the State is centered on
the meeting to be held at Union Park
on Washington's birthday. The Belle
Brandon cup stake will uncover all the
great greyhounds, while the California
plate will attract the champions. The
latter stake will be worth more than $500
to the winner. It is limited to ninety-six
entries at $10, to which will be added $1200
by the Union Coursing Park Association.
Palo Alto has recovered from his recent
accident and is in training for the event.
Beacon, the great blue dog; Sacramento
Boy, now at his best; Luxor, Royal Arch
and all the fleetest greyhounds will be in
the running. P. M. Curtis is giving Sir
Pitt, his crack Cavalier puppy, which
showed so well last year in the Futurity,
a special preparation for the event.
In the Belle Brandon stake Dr. F. P.
Clark of Stockton will start Phosphorus,
the crack youngster, which resembles
For Freedom in color and conformation.
He will be represented also by Fire
cracker and possibly by Maid Â¦ of Termi
nus.
G. MacE. Malcolm will send Majdr
Mason, a brindle dog by Glancer, to the
slips. He will also start Matters Much !
and May Morning. ,
D. J. Healey has five youngsters by
Emln Pasha-Maggie' N which have shown
speed and stamina in a â¢ private trial.
These qualities will be required owing
to the strength of the hares which
"Charley" Griswold has in training.
Sterl & Knowles have one puppy from this
litter.
The Pasha Kennels has a For Free
dom-Metallic youngster which should be
good owing to its breeding. George Starr
has one of the same litter.
A. R. Curtis will start but one dog,
distemper having attacked the majority
of his saplings. His Fetter Free-Rockette
puppies are struggling with the disease
now.
Distemper has not made the ravages
among the young greyhounds this year
which it has in the past. It has been
comparatively mild and few deaths have
resulted up to the present time.
George Nethercott, who won the stake
once with Freda C, will have a sapling
by Emin Pasha-Little Wonder, with
which he hopes to again finish first.
As this meeting is under the auspices
of the interstate coursing committee, a
charge of 25 cents will be made at the
grate.
P. M. Curtis tried out a two-year-old
black dog on Monday which is expected to
prove a factor in coursing soon. He is by
Fetter Free, out of Twilight, a sister to
Skyrocket. Twilight- was eleven years
old when she whelped this dog, 'an un
upual age for a greyhound. Mr. Curtis
pays: "He is the finest dog I ever raised."
This is high praise when the long roll of
stake winners from the San Jose Kennels
is remembered. The new wonder, has been
sick and was allowed to work into form
gradually. Last Monday he was tried
out with Rector, leading him handily. -
W. C. de B. Lopez has sold his clever
greyhound Pepita to George H. Macdoug
all of Butte, Mont This gives the latter
a string of six good performers. He says
there is a demand for good two-vear-old
greyhounds and that five or six could be
sold readily.
In the special stake which will be run
at Union Coursing Park to-day and,to
morrow the winners in the first â¢ round
look to be: .
Harlekn Gladys. A. J. Martin. Luxor Green

Last Saturday the title of woman golf
champion of Southern California, which
has been held for two years past by Mrs
Jean W. Bowers of Garvanza, was won by
Miss Ada N. Smith of â¢ the San Diego
Country Club, who defeated Mrs. J. o
Foster of the Los Angeles Country Club
ln the final round. Tnere were nine en
tries for- the event, and of these four qual
ified. In the opening and semi-final round
Miss Ada H. Smith beat Miss Brownell
2 up,- and Mrs. J. D. Foster defeated Mrs
F. H. Seymour 4 up 3 to play. Mrs. Jean
.W. Bowers of Garvanza tied with Mrs
Foster in the qualifying round, but was
compelled by illness to give up further
part in the contest. The match was played
on the- links of. the Los Angeles Country
Club. Had Mrs. Bowers, who has been
woman champion of SouthÂ«rn California
for the past two or three yetfrs, been able
to continue play, it is probable she would
have- retained' her title, as she has Ion"
been regarded as the strongest player of
her sex in'that part of the State.
Yesterday the .interclub team match of
the Southern California Golf Association
began on the links of the Pasadena Coun
try Club, and- will be concluded to

and plays an eigh teen-hole match with

The second eighteen holes of the first
home-and-home match between teams
representing the San Francisco and Oak
land Golf Clubs will be played this after
noon on the links at Adams Point. Both
clubs will probably have the same repre
sentatives as on last Saturday, though
.some slight changes may be made in the
order in which they are arranged in the
team. The San ' Francisco team in the
first half of the match, which was played
last Saturday on the Presidio links, se
cured the substantial lead of 18 up, so the
Oakland team will have to win 19 up this
afternoon, if the first of the series of
home-and-home matches is to prove a vic
tory for the Alameda County golfers.
Three series of arfnual home-and-home
tournaments have been played and in
every instance the team* have won, by
large or small- margins, on their own
courses.- A knowledge of the local con
ditions counts for more in golf than/ in
any. other game, since no. two courses in
the world are quite alike. Golfers natur
ally acquire some knowledge of the pecu
liarities of courses not far distant from
their own, and men frequently are mem
bers of neighboring clubs. Some of the
San Francisco golrers belong to the Oak
land Golf Club, and some of the Oakland
ers are members of the Presidio organi
zation. Then, previous to matches, mem
bers of the teams make a point of get
ting some . practice on the links of tneir
adversaries. But, though all this tends to
reduce the- disadvantage of playing on
a -course with : which the golfer is not
thoroughly lamiliar, the home team al- J
ways has an advantage. It is, therefore,
not Mnukely. that the Oakland team will
win In this afternoon's play, but it Is
hardly probable that they will wipe off
the score already standing ln favor of San
Francisco. ... ,
â¢The score of J. A. Folger against H. C.
Golcher last Saturday was somewhat un
expected, as.Golcher has been playing a
strong game for some time past and nad
the further advantage of playing on his
home links. But on the other hand War
ren Gregory's defeat of G. D. Greenwood
8 ; up was by a larger margin than would
reasonably have been anticipated. One
satisfactory thing about the contest was
the sportsmanlike manner . in which the
losing team accepted defeat, without
abuse of the weather, the course, their op
ponents or their luck. .
The prospects for a good yachting sea
sen in the neighborhood of San Francisco
are excellent. - The three local clubs are in
a good condition as regards the number
of their members and the expected strug
gle for the possession of the perpetual
challenge cup is awakening much Interest.
Though the matter of fitting out a yacht
to defend the trophy at the expense of the
club created a warm discussion at the an
nual meeting of the Corinthians, there is
littie. doubt that all the money necessary
to equip the defender in the best possible
manner will be forthcoming. The mem
bers of the Corinthian Yacht Club, , even
if ' their directors should be unwilling to
meet a heavy expense, would never con
sent, to let the cup go by default. Once
the decision is made to defend the trophy,
the defense will be made vigorously and
with .little consideration of its cost. It is
strange that Â¦ the most 'strenuous opposi
tion-to the policy of equipping a defender
at the expense of the club should have
been made by the owners of a yacht upon
whose boat several hundred dollars were
expended to fit her for a similar purpose.
The club -has; a large list of members, a
grped income and a numerous fleet. It has
won about four-fifths of all trophies open
to. general competition among the yachts
of the bay.
The South Bay Yacht Club recently held
its annual meeting and elected the fol
lowing officers for the coming year: Com

After being up for over two years it
seems the Davis cups may be finally dis
posed of. The best way of doing thi3
would be to let Smith and Smith and
Collier and Crowell, the two teams that
have won them three times, play the best
two matches out of three for permanent
possession of the cups. As the members
of the club are anxious to see the cups
disposed of the plan of letting these two
teams play for them seems a good one.
In the match of last" Sunday the work
of Chet Smith was a surprise. Although,
the other three players are in a class
above him he played fully as strong a.
game. Crowell also played a good game.
and with better support from his partner
misht have won.
In the second â¢ class Alec Beyf uss and
Judah are left to struggle for supremacy
and the right to meet tne first class win
ner for final honors. Beyfuss is probably
the smallest player in the city, but han
dles his racket with skill. This is Judah' s
first appearance on the park courts and
little is known of his ability.
The winner of the first class will givÂ«
the second class winner odd3 of "fifteen."
This handicap Is too small. Neither oC
the second class men stands much chance
of ultimate victory with so scant a handi
cap. The tournament will be finished to
morrow.
Charles Dunlap, the park champion, and
Harry Routh are left in the first class.
In their two previous tournament matches
Dunlap won each time by a small margin.
Routh has been Improving steadily and
his chances of defeating the champion asrÂ«
good.

while Irwin is conditioning himself at the
Terminal on Haight street.
A large delegation from the Olympic
Club has already ordered a section of
seats so-theycan" be together to root fop
their champion. The- Olympic boxer is in
fine fettle,, having been exercising steadily
for. the last seven months. Curtis Rich
ardson is rounding him Into condition.
The flfteen-round bout between "Jim
my" Britt, the crack amateur lightweight,
and Toby Irwin, which is scheduled for
decision at the Acme Club, Oakland, on
the night of the 18th inst. seems to at
tract unusual attention. Already there la
much speculation as to which boxer will
come out of the mill with flying colors.
Judging from the interest taken In tha
bout by followers of the game who rarely
cross the bay to see a mill it is safe to
predict the lads will draw one of the
biggest crowds that ever attended a prize
fight in Oakland.
The club officials will present as strong
a card as possible and to that end are
looking for a man to meet "Rufe" Turner,
the colored lightweight of Stockton. They
are in communication with Perry Queten
an, who fought Turner a draw recently.
Turner seems at hia best now and would
be an attractive addition to the card.
Lavigne will settle- down to regular
training to-day at Blanken'a. O'Brien
will do his work at San Rafael. He will
have to take off a lot of weight as he
ha3 thickened up considerably during hia
stay on this coast. Lavigne. on the other
hand, is slightly under weight and could
fight below, 130 pounds.
The, men met at Harry Corbett's again
last night and renewed their discussion
of the weight question, the only obstacle
between them and a match on Thursday
eyening." Lavlgne wanted to fight at ISS
pounds, the . lightweight , limit, while
O'Brien wanted 135 pounds. They finally
split -the difference and agreed 1 to weigh
hi; at 3 o'clock on the afternoon of the
fight at 134 pounds. .

DEFEATS \ EL DORADOS
'; NEW > YORK, Feb. 7.â Daniel Levy, alias
"Harry Lewis," will go back to Baltimore'
to answer/a charge of forgery if .the com
plaint against him is pressed, but he is of
the. opinion that. he will able to so square
his accounts that he will soon be at lib
erty and able to enjoy the $41,000 . he
brought with him from San Francisco. '
Levy comes from a respectable family.
He was born" and educated in Brooklyn,
an<i he has several ' brothers now living
with his parents on "Union street in that
borough. The police: know him as an old
offender, though they . do not look upon
him as vicious. He visited police head
quarters as a prisoner twice before his
arrest last Thursday. I On the previous oc
casions he had made victims of his rela
tiVCS -V'"' -' vC\. -
In the police gallery his number is 2149,
and he is recorded. as Daniel Levy, alias
"Red" Levy, alias .David Lewis, alias
"Harry" Lewis. -He is now 27 years old.
He was first -arrested In 1893, when his
brother made complaint against, him . for
Dassing Bpurious checks. Â¦ He was sent to
the Elmira Reformatory: Again in 1897 he
was arrested for putting out worthless
checks, and a short term in Sing Sing re-
S1 i n e CO urt to-day Levy chuckled as he re
lated how i he had â¢ fooled - the representa
tives of a . detective , agency in | California.
He had enjoyed notoriety when he . was
making Â¦ his meteoric career on the Oak
land racetrack. At that time Levy played
for a very large; stake and he had sense
enough, to see that he had failed, and he
withdrew in time to save a small fortune
from the wreck. 'He said:::
â¢ "When '-Â¦ I quit , San Francisco I -. had
$96 000 i Then I plunged in other directions,
the result -being that I .landed in New
York with $41,000 and I have determined to
eetinto some legitimate business while
the chance is mine. I have telegraphed
my 'wife,' and' I hope ttiat she will come
here She will, unless she is too angry.'*
Levy will "be disappointed. 'in' his hope
that his wife will return to him. v; In fact.
he owes his arrest to her determination, to
be s avenged for the insult .put upon ; her
when he ran, away .with another woman.
After a married life of vless than six
months she learned of his movements and

Whitbeck has a -fine reputation an a
teacher and his mental accomplishments
are of a high order. He came Into his
wealth by inheritance from. hi3 father,
who was a local banker. Arthur M. Sey
mo*. an attorney and distant relative of
Mrs. Whitbeck, has taken charge or the
laundry business land It is probable that
an effort will be made to dispose of it.
Whitbeck was interested financially in
other enterprises. His assets are far in
excess of his - liabilities,' and no reason is
known for . his strange .-. departure from
home, friends and business.;
Whitbeck was last seen In San Francisco
about January 11. He had an appointment
to meet a friend at a certain hour there
but failed to J keep it. . Some weeks ago in
an effort to restore him to his family a
warrant ( was sworn out charging him
with the desertion of his wife and child
but It was not served for the reason that
the officer could not find him.

The will of Mrs. Caroline E. Cogswell,
relict of the late Dr. Henry E. Cogswell,
who died in this city Thursday afternoon
after a few days* illness, was filed for
probate yesterday. Mrs. Cogswell, who
possessed $200,000 in her own right, inher
ited a like amount on the death of her
husband, jlhe joint fortune is deposed
of as follows:
Wealthy Young . Sacra
mentan Strangely
Disappears..
.Some time ago the ..Question of-.the-Jri.
coropetency, of Mrs. Daniels ..was brought
before Judge 'Coffey: by a, petition for let
ters of guardianship filed by one of the
woman's S relatives. . Judge j Coffey issued
letters of guardianship . to a- trust com
pany, and subsequently withdrew them,
thus leaving Mrs. Daniels at the mercy of
any one who. might deem it advisable to
prey upon her. . The rapid dwindling : of
the fortune of the unfortunate woman has
attracted I the earnest attention of Judge
Troutt," and he will .pay; Mrs. Daniels a
visit at' the hospital -this morning before
opening court.' " Â¦ . ' .. â¢>-. .
B. H. Nelson of the real estate firm of
Nelson & Johnson testified that he pur
chased the Ashbury. street property, for
which Mrs. Daniels . paid $5125, : for $4350.
His agent in this transaction was G. ' E.
Tucker. Nelson further testified that he
sold the front half of the property .for
$5500, and that he has placed, a value , of
$1000 on the remaining half. ... .^-.r
. .The hearing of the petition for letters of
guardianship t>ver the person and estate
of Mrs., Mary E. Daniels was resumed In
Judge Troutt's court j yesterday. Mrs.
Margaret Halpln is the petitioner, and the
testimony she introduced yesterday sup
ported . her contention that Mrs. Daniels
is incompetent. Mrs. Daniels is a para
lytic, at present confined in the Lane Hos
pital. Considerable Interest is aroused in
the legal proceedings now . being heard,
because she has lost a fortune of $20,000
In a manner. that is at least mysterious.-
According to the testimony introduced
yesterday the loss of Mrs. Daniels' wealth
is due to- deals in realty. She came Into
the money on the "death of her husband,
but little more than five -years ago, and
to-day she has only $3800 left. ' â¢
It was shown yesterday that in 1895 Mrs.
Daniels purchased through the real estate
firm of Burnham &' Marsh property on
Taylor street, north of Geary, for $15,000,
Â¦which the- same agents sold two years ago
for $13,000, .less a commission of 2% per
cent. With the proceeds of this sale
property on Ashbury Heights, near Wal
ler street, and on the northwest corner of
Devisadero and Page streets â¢ was pur
chased: by Burnham & Marsh for Mrs.
Daniel^. Subsequently the I Devlsadero
and Page streets property was exchanged
for property on the same streets, but on
the southwest corner, "the shady side of
the street," for the sale of which the real
estate firm had a contract/There was a
mortgage of $6500 on this property, and
when, on December 24 of last year,- Mrs.
Daniels ' was induced to sell the corner
for 59400 she had to pay the French Bank
$7000 of that amount.

The San Mateo hounds will meet to
day at 2:30 p. m. at the reservoir/ Bur
llngame. The ground is in excellent con
dition owing to the recent rain. All that
is required to make the hunting . men
happy is a. dry day. The hounds are
steadily improving in pace, appearance
and in hunting qualities. Dropping out a
"tail" hound occasionally has worked
wonders with the pack. "Tail" houndsâ
that is, the slowest ones â are of less value
in a drag hunt than in fox, deer or hare
hunting. The gentlemen who hunt with
the San Mateo y hounds should' appreciate
the good sport afforded them this season.
The first polo game of the season will
be played to-morrow at Burlingame. A
notable addition is to be made shortly. to
the ranks of the players. There is no
less a- personage than T. Drysborough,
one of the best players in England and
a recognized authority on the sport. He
is the author of the most comprehensive
book ever 'written on polo, it being the
accepted authority the world over.
Games will be played regularly 'here
after. . .: . . Â¦ .â¢ Â¦:-Â¦ .- â¢ , .... v\->v
On Wednesday Miss Tobln, sister of
such thorough sportsmen aa Richard M.
and Joseph S. Tobin, was fa. member of
the field and surprised those in attend
ance by her horsemanship. She has Just
returned from. Â¦ a year's sojourn in Ire
land, where she hunted regularly with
the representative packs in County ; Mayo.
Having Â¦' ridden over > the stiff, stone
faced fences and, the rough, hilly country
peculiar to that part of Ireland,- she found
little difficulty in negotiating the rail
fences and the delightful foothill country
of San Mateo County.
An unusually large field turned out last
Saturday, its picturesqueness being added
to- by the presence of three whippers-in
clad In the regulation scarlet coat, and
well mounted.
With the return of Francis J. Carolan,
master of San Mateo drag hounds, from
the Bast, the hunting men are showing
renewed interest in that pleasurable
sport. . â¢ â¢ .

yyT his* intention of enforcing, the
(L'-vj "cubic air"/ ordinance, caused the
-^â¢^ arrest of 153 lodgers and two pro
. ..."prietors of cheap lodging houses
early 'ye'sterdav morning. The arrests
were made by^ Policemen Cooney, Nolt
ing, Cassidy and . Clancy and the patrol
wagons were kept busy for a time con
veying the prisoners to the City Prison.
Peter Dolan's lodging-house at 675 How
ard street was first raided and Dolan and
forty-one lodgers were arrested. The
lodging-house x is in the basement and
Dolan's charges are 5 cents for a bunk
Â¦under'the sidewalk and 10. cents for a\cot
in the center of the cellar. Fifteen men
were found sleeping in bunks in a space
thirty- two by. sixteen feet. In Frank
Ziegler;s lodging-house, 184 Jessie street,
sixty lodgers and Ziegler.were arrested.
This is a 10-cent lodging-house and in a
room twelve by twelve feet ten men were
found sleeping. The third place visited
was William T. Wert's lodging-house at
34 Minna street, where fifty-two sleepers
were arrested. "Wert had evidently been
made aware of .the intended visit of the
officers, as he could not be found. There
i3 a' warrant out. for his arrest. In a
room'eight and a half by nine and three
quarters feet four men were sleeping.
The cases were divided among the four
The "cubic air" ordinance provides that
each occupant of a sleeping room must
have 500 cubic feet of air. - A violation of
the ordinance in the case of proprietors
of lo'dging houses is punishable by a fine
of not less than $50 and not more than
$500, and in the case of lodgers by a fine
of not less than $10 and not more than $50
Chief Wittman says that these packed
lodging-houses breed disease and for the
health of the community the ordinance
must be enforced. The lodgers say that
they get the- tickets for a bed from ben
evolent societies and they have no other
place to go.
Police Judges and Judges Conlan, Fritz
and Mogan agreed to hold court in the
prison so as not to cause . the. waste of
time and annoyance of having such a
large crowd brought into their court
rooms. The men were ranged in batches
before each Judge and they all declared
that they did not know what they had
been arrested for. The law was ex
plained to them, and they were notified
that although technically guilty of a vio
lation of the ordinance the real fault lay
with the proprietors,, who should have
made themselves acquainted with the
law. The prisoners were all dismissed,
Judge Mogan remarking that it was a
case 'of poverty being a crime. The cases
of. the two proprietors, Dolan and Zlegler,
were continued. Judge Cabaniss'had his
batch brought Into his courtroom to be
discharged. Â¦-

COFFEE EYES.
It Attacks Many Persons There.
To illustrate how coffee can affect the
eyes the words cf a lady In Woodland, la.,
are quoted:
"I v.at. brought up to believe that- tea
was injurious, but was allowed to drink
coffee from childhood. Ever since I can
remember I have been subject to severe
attacks of headache, otherwise my health
was pretty good until a short time ago
my eyes became affected; they ached and
pained me continually and were often
badly inflamed. I also had queer, dizzy
feelings in my head almost continually.
"One time we were obliged to do without
milk or cream, for a few weeks, and not
relishing my coffee clear I left off Its use.
In a short time I was surprised to find
my eyes greatly improved, and I felt bet T
ter in every way, still I did not mistrust
the coffee and began its use as soon as we
got the cream again. VÂ» r lthin a few days
iry eyes were worse than ever. Then I
resolved to quit coffee absolutely and take
up Postum. This I did and my eyes
quickly recovered.
"My experience shows that while coffee
caused headache and eye trouble Postum
Food Coffee does not produce any bad ef-
fects whatever and is greatly strengthen-
ing: and nourishing." Name "given by

Pilot Fred Jordan and Captain Monroe
of the steamship Leelanaw were capsized
near Broadway dock yesterday while try
ing to regulate the course of a young
horse along East street. They were navi
gating from the hurricane deck of a gro
cery wagon. They were bound for Meiggs
wharf, where a boat was waiting to take
them aboard the Leelanaw. Captain Mon
roe held the lines.
"Look out for that rock," said the small
boy, who should have been driving.
"Starboard a little, captain," said "lit
tle" Jordan.
"That's no rock; it's mud," replied Mon
roe, holding on his course.
It was a rock. ...
The wagon stopped, the shafts carried
away ana the horse contined the journey
alone. Monroe was dragged several feet
but escaped with a mud bath. Jordan
was thrown to the ground with consider
able violence and sustained a nasty
wound on his cheekbone.
"It was a rock all right," said Jordan as
he left the Harbor Receiving Hospital.

No cause is assigned for the deed, ex
cept that both parties are said to have
had a quarrel over some trifling affair last
night.
The murderer fired five shots into his
victim's head at short range and then one
shot into his own. Beneath his body was
found a new razor, around the handle of
which was wound a piece of light rope,
it probably having, been his intention to
complete the work of murder and sui
cide with it in the event the revolver
failed.

NEWS OF THE OCEAN.
In view of the fact, however, that this
was the first case where the commanding
general had directed the execution of
the sentence of death against an enlistea
man without reference to the War De
partment, the case was laid before Presi
dent Roosevelt in time to prevent the ex
ecution in case he desired to do so. Tn>>
President, after consultation with the
Secretary of War. declined to interfere
and a cable message to this effect was
cent to General Chaffee Wednesday. Al
though no official information to that ef
lect has been received, it is assumed at
the War Department that the sentence
cf death in each case was carried into
effect to-dav. .

ALTHOUGH the steamship China
left the Pacific Mail dock yes
terday on the tap of 1 o'clock, it
was after 5 when she crossed the
bar and got fairly started on her
voyage. The bar was breaking all morn
ing-, but the stormy weather outside tha
heads increased in violence as tue uay yoc
older. â¢ The China poked her nose outside
the heads, got a whiff of the southeaster
and a glimpse- of the foaming bar and
came back and anchored off Meigg3
wharf until 4:15, when she resumed her
voyage. The China carried a large num
ber of passengers and a very heavy car
go. The last passenger on board was a
young man who arrived at the gangplank
out of breath and covered with perspira
tion. He had no ticket and no baggage.
He just had to get to Honolulu, he said,
and as he had the necessary money he
was allowed to pay his fare to the . pur
ser. As the big liner pulled away trom
the dock such .of the Chinese crew as
were not coiling"up lines turned loose a
fusllade of crackers in celebration of the
New Year festival they will have to cele
brate at sea. .

markable cures made by Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets and promptly bought a fifty cent box from
my druggist and obtained such positive -benefit
from that one. package that I continued to use
them : dally, until - 1 now ; consider myself en-
tirely .free from the disgusting, annoyance of
catarrh ; â¢ my head is . clear, : my digestion air I
could i ask and my hearing, which ! had begun
to fall as a result of the catarrh, has greatly
improved, until I feel I can hear ' as well as
ever. -.They are â¢. a household necessity in my
family." Â¦ '. â¢ Â¦ >> . . Â¦ . -â¢ Â¦ Â¦Â¦ Â¦
-Stuart's- Catarrh 1 Tablets are sold by drug-
gists at 60 cents for complete treatment;- and
for convenience, safety and prompt results they
are undoubtedly the long looked for catarrh
cure, .-- .' . . . . â¢ ,
Mr. C. R:. Rembrandt of Rochester. N. T..
says: ; "I know of few people who have suf-
fered; as much as I from Catarrh of the bead
throat and stomach. ' I used spray s, .. inhalers
and powders for months at a :time with .only
slight Â¦ relief, and had no . hope j of cure. I had
no\ the = means to make a change of climate,
which seemed my only chance of cure. : ::
Unlike many catarrh , remedies Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets contain no cocaine, opiate or any
Injurious drug whatever and are equally bene-
ficial for little children and adulta. â Â¦
' :. The manufacturers of ..the' new catarrh cure.
Stuart's ; Catarrh Tablets, have- succeeded ad-
mirably in accomplishing this result. -They are
large, pleasant tasting lozenges,- to be dis-
solved In the mouth, thus reaching every, part
of the mucous membrane of the throat and
finally the stomach. : Â¦ .
- The best and most modern ' remedies for this
purpose are , antiseptics scientifically' known as
Eucalyptol, Gualacol, Sangulnarla and Hydras-
tin, and while each of these have been success-
fully used separately, yet It has been difficult
to get them all combined in one palatable,- con-
venient and. efficient form.'
.; A remedy to really cure catarrh must.be an
Internal remedy, which will â¢cleanse the. blood
from catarrhal poison and remove .the fever
and congestion from the mucous ' membrane.
The catarrhal poison is In, the' blood and the
mucous membrane of the nose, throat and
trachea tries to relieve the system -by secret-
ing large quantities of mucus, the discharge
sometimes closing up the nostrils, dropping
into the throat, causing deafness by. closing the
Eustachtan tubes, and after a time' causing
trouble. . â¢ t - {. . . ',.
if they accomplish anything at all, simply give
transient relief. Â¦ Â¦ . ; Â¦ â¢ .'

THE PROBLEM.
I T"*^ OROTHY in the nursery can calculate the
tp^fj P" ce Â°^ Ivory Soap per cake, but it would
4gjgij| take a mathematical genius to calculate its
-Â¦-- J true value. For he musf take account of
time, labor, and materials. He must deduct from the
apparent cost the saving in the longer life of the cake,
in the longer life of the washed fabric, in the labor
required, in the time consumed, in the strength ex-
pended, in the results obtained. When all is finished,
Ivory is the cheapest soap in the world. It floats.

STOCK MARKET.
The Potato Â¦ market continues firm under a
fair local demand and light receipts, but prices
are unchanged. There was an easier feeling in
Onions, as heavier supplies are expected from
Oregon, owing to the mild.er weather in that
State. One car came in yesterday, and there is
another close at hand.' Nevada Onions, which
were held â¢ at $3 per ctl Thursday, . were offer
ing yasterday at $2 75, with few-buyers.
Receipts of Southern Vegetables by rail were
light and those per steamer much lighter than
expected. ThP killing frosts about Loa Ange
les have bo reduced the supplies that prices In
the home market are almost- as high as those
obtained here. The steamer Tucapel, which ar r

Trade developments this week have been
largely, favorable. AH the measures of legiti
mate, trade point to January equaling In most
respects and exceeding in many the records of
a year ago. Failures, it is true, were larger
in - number, but . the Increase was all at the
South, from which trade reports have been
poor, but' show a slightly more hopeful trend
since cotton has taken Its move upward. The
general level of prices moved slightly down
ward during January, owing to lower prices
'of ppeculatively dealt in cereals and hog pro
ducts and a heavy decrease in crude rubber and
some chemicals. Most of. the decline in food
products has been recovered since February 1.
The close of the week finds a confident faeifug
prevailing in nearly all lines of distributive
trade. Â¦-.:Â¦â¢Â¦* . ~ ., â¢ .

NEW TORK, Feb. 7.â The movement of
prices in to-day's rtock market became highiy
Irregular, but the tone was healthier and the
breadth aod activity in the market were main
'tained at yesterday's level. The professional
operators, who largely absorbed the market.
operated wilt considerable confidence and did
v not hesitate U buy and bid up stocks in new
charters at the Fame time as they were taking
profits on their recent purchases in others.
Seme of the closely held "investment stocks,
Â¦n-Rlch have had eensaUonal advances recently
l^cause there were no shares for eale even at
much higher bids, relapsed violently to-day on
attempts to take profits, illustrating the nar
rowness cf the market for thi6 class of etock6.
Small offerings are as effectual in forcing de
clines as are email purchases in causing ad
vances, the lneidere in these ttm-ks being- qui.e
indifferent to their course in the sepculative
market. Lackawanna slumped fe points of
yeeterday'B loss cf nearly 5 points, and North
west dropped 4 : Â», without recovery. Lacka
Â¦-var.n*. howe\*er, rallied 5 points. The same
tendency was shown to a less degree In a
number of other railroad etrjeks which havÂ«
been unreasonably bid up of late. Â¦ There was
a very notable pressure to realize profits also
in Southern Parific, In which the dealings con
tinued on a very large scale. Amalgamated
Copper was about the only stock in the list
that showed positive depression. Its Ices at
one time extended to 2%, but this was re
duced by a. rally to I'-m- The celling of the
ctock was ostensibly due to a reaction In the
price of copper and to allegations that the
oempany haJ oversold its product at the re
sent low level ir. the copper market. The prin
cipal factor of ttrength In the market was Illi
nois Central, which advanced an extreme 3%
on a volume of dealings very unusual In that
mthÂ«Â»r closely held security. The advance had
no other explanation than the relatively low
price of 'the ttiv-k compared with other stocks
similarly eitaated and paying only as great
<>r even smaller dividends. The advance in
the etock brought out various old rumors of
absorption of minor systems and the stocks
V t many railroads which could by any possl-
be available for merging with Illinois
Central were advanced eharply- The favorable
showing of the great corn-carrying railroads
fcr December, as tn the case of Burlington and
Rock Inland. aJso helped to strengthen this
Clam. There was an 'energetic buying mow-.
ment late in the day In Atchtson, which seemed
to be liased on the fact that the movement in
tt.e slock this week has not been commensur
ate with that in others. This description ap-
plies to various other movements -of the day.
There was ar; upward rush in Metropolitan
Street Railway, which carried it 2% over last
night, and a similar movement of more than
2 points in Pugar. but neither of these was
maintained. Brooklyn Rapid Transit rose more
than a point. Lat" jn the day Manhattan was
raided down 2 points on the news of an un
favorable court <3fri8ion against the company,
and thU made the closing of the market un
settled. Little attention was paid to estimates
of the bank statement, as the- tone of the
money market continued eaFy.
The bond market was quite active, but ir
regular. Total eales, par value. $3,280,000.

CHICAGO, Feb. 7. â Corn started slightly
firmer on cables, which responded to yester
day's local improvement. There we're a few
buying orders out and May opened unchanged
to %c higher at 63Â»4c to Â«l%c. Milder weather
and very elack business, however, soon turned
sentiment and the Â¦ bears took control of the
market. At no time did the market go above
opening prices. Rains were renorted in Ar
gentina, and Kansas City was having a weak
market. Heavy selling developed and prices
declined steadily. May closed weak, IVio low
er, at t>2 %c.
"Wheat ' was dull again all day and ruled
weak under the deprc-ssing corn influence. At
the opening a elightly better cash demand,
Improved cables and a small demand for short
covering helaed prices a little. May started
about %c hisher at 78!-i@78%c. but soon
turned easy. There was almost a total absence
of outside business and the dullness favored
bearish sentiment. The corn break, .however,
was the prime factor. May fluctuated rather
narrowly after it sold off to 77%c._ The close
was weak, May %c lower at 7i%@u%c,
Oats were at their highest price at the open
ing. Trade was very. dull. The market pdld
off witli corn. May closing weak and %@lc
lower at 43%c. , ,
Provisions were weak at the opening on large
receipts and lower prices at the yards. Later
packers bouzht liberally and the market re
covered. May pork closed 12 %c lower, lard 5@
7 %c lower and ribs 5c down.

Poultry and Game.
Â» , The Poultry market was slightly weaker
yesterday, as the demand for the Chinese New
Tear is over, but as receipts were light the
market cleaned up well. There was a wider
range in the quotations in Dressed Turkeys,
owing to the large supplies and the abundance
of second-class stock. Fine- young Hens sold
readily at the top quotations, but old Hens and
Gobblers were not wanted.
Receipts of Game were about 00 sacks and
Snipe and Gray Geese were scarce 1 and higher.

Eggs continued weak yesterday, and the mar

a car for the East, but the shipper could not get
enough at his price and gave It up. Offerings,
however, were ample for the local demand.

â¢ Chicago opened rather higher on better for
eign advices, but relapsed into dullness on ac

The mill is a perfect 1 working model, re
duced one hundred times, of the Califor
nia typo of a five-stamp quartz mill. From
the ore car at the T mouth of the tunnel
down to the clean-up barrel and. tank
every detail of a regular mill is repre
sented proportionally, including a con
centrator, a tiny Blake crusher, a feeder
and â¢ a grizzly. The model . is operated by
a small electric motor, and' its operation
attracts much attention from visitors;

after a collision with the French bark
Max, was a witness in Judge Ellsworth's
court this morning,, where he was called

with him on the deck of the sinking ves
sel, assisting the passengers Into the
boats.: When the ship went down they
went with it: After coming to the surface
and clambering on a- raft the master
looked for Connell, but could not find him.
A more thorough search .was made after
his 'party was picked up by, the steamer

From the evidence of A. L. Hall, . master,
who says he spoke to Third Officer Hughes on
the bridge after the watches were changed at
4 a. m., and left him there when he went be
low; E. Lupp, second Officer, who says that he
was relieved by Third Officer Hughes at 4 a.
m. ; Ephraim Johnson, who says he saw Third
Officer Hughes in the chart house with Second
Officer Lupp when" he reported ..the light to
him, after 4 a. m., and that Mr. Hughes an
swered him, saying all right; Quartermaster M.
Llngan; who says that he saw Third Officer
Hughes In the chart house with Second Of
ficer Lupp after he came to report the com
pass to Mr. Lupp after 4 a. m., and Quarter
master E. Ettershank, who says that Mr.
Hughes was on the watch after 4 a. m., it
places John Hughes, who held a master's li
cense and .was third officer on the Walla Wal
la at that time, in charge of tne steamer when
the collision occurred, and In the absence of
his defense we have to exonerate A. L. Hall,
master, and F. Lupp, second officer, the surviv
ing officers who were on trial before us for the
loss of the Walla Walla. â¢ Â¦Â¦â¢".,
After a careful consideration of the evidence
given In this case, some of which is contra
dictory and questionable, we are of the opin
ion that the collision 'between the' steamship
Walla ' Walla - and the Ftencn bark Max", on
January 2, 1902. occurred between 4 :05- and
4:13 approximately. At the time that. the ves
sels came together it is evident that the Walla
Walla was cut into by the stem of the Max in
the vicinity of her bridge, the Max penetrating
through two of her decks into the combing of
her No. 2 hatch and below the water line into
No. 2 hold, which' was filled in a few minutes;
the water then rushed along* the, freight deck,
causing the steamer to sink rapidly by the
head- and thfrty-flve minutes afterwards 'she
sank; and the forward part of the Max was
carried away, forward of her collision bulkhead;
she was afterward towed to San Francisco (on
January 4) by the United States revenue cutter
McCulloch and the steam schooner Acme; that
the cause of the collision was due to the faulty
lookout kept on the Walla Walla by the officer
in charge of the bridge, who was in the chart
house, and the men on ' lookout, one of whom,
named Wilson, was not at. his post when the
collision occurred. . Had the officers seen thÂ«s
light from the bridge when it was first reported
by Johnson, .who was on the lookout forward,
which is placed at from three to five minutes,
the steamer making twelve knots per hour, be
fore the collision, had he at that time ordered
the helm put hard-a-starboard instead of hard
a-port he would have gone clear, or he might
have stopped and backed his engines .full
speed. We are also, of the opinion that at the
time of the collision the lights on the Max
were' burning and that she kept " her course
from the time the lights were made out until
the, collision occurred. She was on the star
board tack. The time given' by Second Officer
Lupp as 4:33 a. m. as the time the collision
took, place is In our opinion erroneous, as the
evidence places it at from 4:05 to 4:15 approxi
mately. Â¦ . Â¦ . Â¦
Master and Second Officer Exonerated
Officers on Duty Are Blamed.
Four boats and four life rafts carrying. 6tt
people were picked up by the Dispatch on Jan
uary 2 and taken to Eureka, and on the 3d
the tug Ranger picked up a boat with 14
persona and took - them to Eureka, one ' boat
landed at -Trinidad with 7 persons, one at Big
Lagoon with 10, - and . one at Stone Lagoon
with 7. and the Nome City picked up 7 on a
life raft and brought them to San Francisco.
The boatage of the Walla Walla was in ex
cess of the requirements of law, she having
ten boats, i five life rafts, equal to 3070 feet
of* boatage, the law requiring but 2S80, and
provided- with 560 life preservers; she -was
manned by 79 persons, officers and crew, and
had 67 passengers on this trip when she left
San Francisco; of these 10 are missing and 6
died, . and of the officers and crew 18 are miss
ing and 2 died, making a total of 36 persons
who lost their lives. " * .â¢'*â¢..
The steamship Walla Walla. 3069 tons, was
built at Chester, Pa., In 1881, and rebuilt at
San Francisco in 1S9O; she was inspected and
certificated at San Francisco, October 14, 1901.
She had five bulkheads, which came to the
deck next below the main deck. Had these
bulkheads extended to the maindeck it is our
opinion that the steamer would '. have floated,
as Mr. Reed's statement shows that there was
no water in the flreroom or -the engine-room
thirty minutes after the collision to amount to
anything, but when he came on the main deck
the forward stairway was awash.
An Excess of Boatage.
Captain Hall stated that none of the boats
deserted the steamer; he gave .them orders to
lay by.- but thinks they may have drifted away:
that there were no officers in the boats save
Third Assistant Engineer Brown is explained
by the captain that ,. after getting the pas
sengers into the boats he thought there might
b'e a chance to save the ship and pick- the
people who were In the boats up afterward;
he had given orders to the chief engineer to
blow down' the port boilers to givfr her a star
board list and try to get the hole above water
if uossible; there is not a doubt that the
officers of the Walla Walla assisted in lower
ing all the boats that were lowered and helped
the passengers into them (as Captain Hall, -First
Officer Nlelson, Secondp Officer Lupp. Chief
Engineer 'Crosby. First Assistant Engineer
Reed, Second Assistant Engineer Potter, Fourth
Mate Brown. Purser Nuttman and Chief Stew
ard Connell were on the upper deck when the
steamer sank and were trying to lower away
boats 9 and 10, which were not swung in
davits. Â¦ No. 9 was Just ready to be launched
when the steamer gave a lurch, plunged for
ward and went down, carrying thÂ«se Â¦ people
with her. Captain Hall, First Officer Nlelson,
Second Officer Lupp, Fourth Officer Brown and
First Assistant Engineer Reed were saved and
the others drowned.
After the collision the testimony taken by
us from all witnesses .that appeared at the in
vestigation shows that s the boats and rafts
were promptly launched in good order, and
from the number of boats and rafts got out
there was enough afloat to have carried 230
persons, though there- were. but 168 on board,
some ' of . the - passengers refused to go into
the boats; some were .in' them and came out
again, and in so doing delayed the effort* of
the officers and crew from helping others, and
when the steamer sank they were drowned;
the statement of Captain Swan, passenger, that
the boats pulled away from the sinking steamer
Instead ol standing by cannot.be explained in
any way by us; he says that, when he came to
the surface, after the steamer went down, he
heard people halloo for help and it continued
lor tome time; no boats being in sight some of
these people drowned. ;
Captains Bolles and Bulger, United
States Local' Inspectors of Steam Ves
sels, filed their report yesterday after
noon, in the matter of the loss of the
steamship "Walla ! Walla. The blame . Is
placed on 'the faulty lookout kept on the
Walla Walla by the officer In charge. of
the bridge, who was in the charthouse,
and the men oh the lookout, one of whom,
Wilson, was not at his post of duty.. Cap
tain Hall and Second Officer Lupp are
exonerated.
After summing up the evidence taken
before them the inspectors say:

Some time ago the Collector, alarmed at
the frequent escapes of Chinese. laborers
from the. custody of the steamship com
pany, suggested to the Secretary of the
Treasury the advisability of requiring the
corporation to give a 'bond in the sum' of
$500 for each Chmaman., The Secretary
thought favorably of the suggestion and
the Collector notified the steamship people
of the .correspondence. To his surprise
they returned an answer yesterday that,
they were not in. favor of a regulation
holding them financially responsible for
the sate keeping of their coolie passengers.
There were not many escapes anyhow,
there being only sixteen in nine years,
they said, and, besides, the Government
had assumed a part of the responsibi.ity.
by appointing watchmen from the Chi
nese Bureau to assist- the Â¦ company's
watchmen. They Intimated that the* bu
reau watchmen were not saints and that
the Government might find out- a little
by picking the beam out of its own eye
before finding fault with the optics of tho
corporation. The Collector has forwarded
this reply to' the Secretary of the Treas
ury, and he will be heard from by and by.
During the past twelve months seven
teen Chinese laborers have escaped from
the detention shed, notwithstanding the
watchmen. Some of the escapes smacked
strongly of collusion, but no redress .'was
obtained by the Government. It. was not
pretended that the corporation connived
at these escapes; in fact,.; such was not
the case. But there were, no bonds and
nobody could be held responsible. The de
tention shed is used as the deck of a ship,
and coolies, awaiting permission to land
as well , as coolies ordered deported : aro
confined there awaiting the decision of the
Collector or the sailing of .the steamers
to take them home. Collector Strattonis
of the opinion that bonds should be given
in return for the courtesy extended by the
Government to the steamship company. ;
The agents of the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company have "notified Customs Col
lector Stratton that the company will not,
unless compelled by a treasury, regulation,
give a bond for the safe keeping of Chi
nese in the detention' shed at the Mail
dock. Â¦.'...-.'. . Â¦â¢â¢,.' Â¦

The children, said Becker, were housed In
a manner that was shameful and he
likened their abode to an Immense box.
He said also that Mr. and Mrs. Biter's
charges did not appear to him to be prop
erly clothed, and he picked a little white
haired girl out of the boys and girls run
ning about the courtroom and, holding
her in his arms, said:
Secretary White was the first wlthes3.
He denied the existence of any conspiracy
and said he was anxious to secure the
custody of the children for their own
good. He also said his attorney had in
formed him that he was within his legal
rights as secretary of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children in pe
titioning for letters of guardianship, and
that, therefore, he wanted the custody of
the children because he believed that the
Biters were not fit and propr persons to
raise the little ones. y-
The presence of the children in the court
is due to the hearing of a petition for
guardianship over the persons of the three
Allen children tiled by Mrs. Biter. Mrs.
Biter claims that the petition tiled by Sec
retary White forithe guardianship of the
children is prompted by a desire to do her
harm and she says that White is unfit to
have control of the little ones. She also
alleges conspiracy on the part of White
and other members of the California So
ciety.
Surrouride by fifteen youngsters of all
ages, sizes, colors and sexes, Mrs. Cath
erine Biter, proprietress of the famous
Biter "baby farm", .of San Rafael, ap
peared in Department 9 of the Superior
Court yesterday and presented the little
ones as living proof that, the .charges
made against her by Secretary M. J.
White of the California Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children were
unfounded. The little ones were fainy
well dressed, appeared to, be in good
health and spirits, and gave no evidence
that they were poorly fed or unhappy.
Testimony was introduced, however,
showing that the charges of the Biters
were poorly housed and poorly fed.

It is pointed out to-day that on the oc
casion vf the coronation she will not rank
Â¦uith the relatives of otner sovereigns wno
will be in attendance, but she win follow
Mrs. Wnitelaw Reid, wife of the Special
Embassador. In European diplomacy do
provision is made for tne position at court
Junctions of relatives of a President of
a republic and it would be embarrassing
to Great Britain to assign Miss Roosevelt
to a piace among the relatives of mou
archs. This embarrassment will be avoid
ed by a relegation of Miss Roosevelt to
the class of "distinguished visitors."
"In sending the special embassv and his
daughter to the coronation," saia a diplo
mat who talked about the matter to-day,
"it is evident that the President desires to
show the world the depth of his friend
ship for Great Eritain. In any event he
has established a precedent of importance.
At every future coronation the. United
States must be represented bv a special
embassy, otherwise there will be created
an :ll-feelingr, which I am sure this Gov
ernment does not care to provoke."
In return for this signal honor Great
Britain is doubtless willing to accord 10
Miss Rooeevelt the most nattering atten
tions, "even," to quote a. well-known dip
lomat, *'to place her on a separate
tnr-jne." But tne President does not want
his caughter to receive a.ny. - :spec*aÂ» hon
ors ana she will go to the coronation as a
â¢"aisiinguistiea visitor."
While it is generally known that the
President was actuated by a desire to
comply with his daughter's Wish, the fact
is not lost sight of In diplomatic circles
that Europe will regard the presence of
Miss Roosevelt as an indication of the
friendship felt by the administration for
England.
CALL BUREAU. 14C6 G STREET. X.
W.. WASHINGTON. Feb. 7.â President
Roosevelt's permission to his daughter,
Miss Alice, to attend the coronation of
King: Edward VII, is looked upon by dip
lomats In Washington as an extraordinary
honor to Great Britain.
Epecial Dispatch to The Call.
The committee held an afternoon ses
sion, during which Senator Morgan ques
tioned Admiral Walker concerning the
difficulties of c.onstructing a canal by the
Panama route. He asked especially about
the effect of the water discharge through
the spillway from the artificial lake to be
made by the construction of the Bohio
dam. In response Admiral Walker said
that he thought it possible that the water
would find Its way back into the canal,
but he did not seem inclined to think that
the canal would be injured by it If it d.d.-
Admiral Walker will continue his testi
mony to-morrow.
He expressed the opinion tnat Brito har
bor, at the Pacinc end of the Nicaragua
route, would possess an advantage Over
the Panama harbor, in that vesseis would
be immediately able to avail themselves
in the former of the trade winds, while in
Panama Bay they would noc secure this
advantage until lowed out to sea. How
ever, he thought that good harbors could
be cheaply secured at the western ter
minals of both routes.
With reference to the estimate that ten
years would be necessary to buad the
Panama canal, white eight years would
sutnee for the construction of the canai
by the Nicaragua route, he said the dif
ference againt.1 the Panama route was
due largeiy to the extent of the great
Culebra cut and the Bohio dam. He
thought that In ordinary weather steam
vessels would be able to make their way
through the Panama canal without being
towed, but that towage might be neces
sary when the winds are high.
The admiral spoke at some length upon
the engineering features of tne two
canals. Senator Harris questioned him
especially with reference to the difficulty
of excavating for the Bohlo dam, develop"
ing the fact that It would be necessary to
sink the proposed piers to a greater depth
than had ever been done for such a pur
pose. The foundation of the pier will be
VÂ£, feet below sea level, and tne witness
said there were differences of opinion ag
10 the atmospheric pressure and the pos
sibility of seepage at th.s depth in that
ci.mate. He said that with reference to
stepage the engineers of the commission
lii-d not agreed.
.Admiral Walker was also questioned
concerning the possibility of utilizing the
cnagres Kiver as a part ot the canai. He
jiuiu.tttd that it was a torrential stream,
but expressed the opinion that it could
be safely confined.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.â Admiral John
C. Walker, chairman of the Isthmian
Canal Commission, testified before the
Senate Committee on Interoceanic Canals
to-day. In reply to numerous questions
he explained the reasons for the recent
recommendation of the acceptance of the
offer of the Panama Canal Company.

All day yesterday the josshouses were
thronged with supplicants, and the Chi

The Interiors of the latter were decorated
in gaudy colors and sweet-scented flow

pig and other delicacies gave evidence of
the teasts that are to follow. The res

The holiday will continue three days.
To-day will be a visiting day, oevoted to

yesterday morning with a blaze and

their debts and laid aside hatch

hied themselves to the various meeting
houses, where they inhaled Incense and
worshiped at the snrine of the high joss.
The narrow thoroughfares burn bright
wiih lanterns and resound with the sput

Dwyer. Loughery was the Union Labor
party's nominee for Sheriff at the last
municipal election. The convention gave
him the nomination by acclamation. He
had only one competitor, whose name was
withdrawn before the ballot was cast. For
the office of Sheriff Loughery received
17,415 votes. This large vote attested his
popularity in labor circles. The conven
tion . recognized him as an earnest advo
cate of the cause of union labor. When
the recent strike was ordered he was the
business agent of the Porters'. Packers'
and Warenousemen's Union and also a
member of the executive committee of the
City Front federation. Prior to his ac
ceptance of the agency for the union he
was employed by Levi\ Strauss & Co., but
resigned his place with that firm to serve
his fellow workers. In appointing him to
the office of Supervisor Mayor Schmltz
recognized a Democrat of the Union La
