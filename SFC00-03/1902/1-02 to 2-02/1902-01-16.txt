Denies Mayor's Jurisdiction.
Attorney Riordan bases his denial of the
"I want your statement abouf this con
tract," the Mayor said to Mahony, and
again urged him >' to '-take' the, oath, but
iuordan refused to permit it.
"I will not say that he did not," said
Riordan, "but he did not sign anything in
violation of the law."
"I will make this statement," said At
torney Riordan, "my client has not
signed any contract in violation of the
law." â¢ V Â¦/.:'
"Did he sign the contract specified by
The Call?" asked Mayor Schmitz. ;>?â¢.
Abe Ruef , the Mayor's attorney, came
in during the discussion and advised the
Mayor that he had authority to proceed.
In answer to the- Mayor's assertion that
if a charter provision had been violated in
the distribution of rewards he surely had
power under the charter to remove the
offender from office, Riordan replied that
such distribution of rewards as per the
alleged contract had not been made.
Riordan explained the grounds of his
objections to investigation by the Mayor.
He said the office was a county office
and its incumbent could not be removed
by the chief, executive of the municipal
ity; and that even if Mahony could be re
moved from office by the Mayor for cause,
the alleged offenses were committed be
fore the election of either "Mahony or the
Mayor and were beyond the range of legal
inquiry by the Mayor. â¢
"Acting under the advice of my attor
ney," Mahony replied, Jj "I refuse to be
sworn. We do not recognize your Juris
diction in this matter."
! Mayor Schmitz asked Mahony if he was
ready to be : sworn, and held up his hand,
preparing to administer the oath.
Mahony Refuses to Testify..
A little later the manager of The Call
arrived and was admitted to the inner
office.
Mahony and his attorney, Thomas D.
Riordan, were waiting in the outer room
of the Mayor's office when the hour set
for the Investigationâ 2 o'clockâ came.
Soon after they, were ushered into the
Mayor's presence.
The investigation was in executive ses
sion, and at 4:30 o'clock Mayor Schmitz
sent for the reporters, who were waiting
in the outer office, and informed them
that the investigation had been continued
and would proceed at 2 o'clock this after
noon, when other witnesses would be
present. He said that nothing would be
given out until the conclusion of the in
vestigation, when copies of the steno
graphic report would be furnished the
papers.
accounts of the knowledge that
had come to them of the County Clerk's
disregard of law in his efforts to secure
office. John Flood made lame denial of
remembrance of the now famous ante
election contract, - but , would not state
positively that he ; had not signed such a
contract. Mahony himself refused to tes
tify, acting on the advice of his attorney.
FOR two hours and a half yester
*day afternoon the Mayor's office
was a torture Â¦ chamber for Bert
Mahony. .Two witnesses gave
Mayor Schmitz straightforward
Grand Jury Is Another Story.
But there is another host with whom
Mahony doubtless will continue to- deny
the Mayor's Jurisdiction. Mayor Schmitz,
in common with all except the few whose
selfish interests array them with Ma
hony, is evidently convinced .of the Coun
ty Clerk's guilt, for the evidence is con
clusive and Mahony' s course, even in the
absence of positive testimony, would con
vict him before any tribunal where Jus
tice is not both blinded and gagged by
legal technicalities. There is little doubt
that the Mayor will proceed with charac
teristic vigor against the wobbly County
Clerk whose feet have strayed so far
from the path of official rectitude. Ma
hony's attorney will appeal to the courts, â¢
and If the law's safeguards against pun
ishment of the innocent can be invoked
for the protection of the all but self-con
victed public servant Mahony is likely to
continue for some months to come his ob
noxious direction of incompetent deputies,
who are fast making a muddle of the af
fairs of the living and of the dead that
must become matters of record in the
County Clerk's office.
But Mahony mops his brow and stands
pat, content that the world may think as
it likes, if only he can hold on in sheer
desperation until some legal light can find
a soft spot on which he. and his political
ambitions may fall in a heap.
' Tnvestigaticnr Not Completed. -
The investigation by the Mayor was not
completed yesterday. It will continue
this afternoon at 2 o'clock. Former Coun
ty Clerk Deane will be called upon to
testify, and Mrs. Deane will be asked to
relate what she knows of some of Bert
Mahony' s ante-election pledges to her
husband and his later appeals to the men
whom he had turned down so treacher
ously to spare him the disgrace of ex
posure and to give him a chance to free
himself from the baneful influence of
Crimmlns and Herrin that .he may yet
fulfill his promises to his personal friends.
"A favor to me?" repeated the big
Mayor in stentorian voice, with indigna
tion in every tone. "It is no favor to me.
If I were the County Clerk and were In
nocent of the charges made by The Call
I would have been at the Mayor's office
yesterday demanding a full and complete
investigation, not seeking to evade an in
terview and later denying the Mayor ju
risdiction in the case."
"We deny your authority to invest!-,
gate charges of ante-election miscon
duct," said Riordan, "and with all due
deference to your position my client will
refuse to be sworn. We are here simply
out of respect to your office, as a favor
to you."
Mahony and his attorney, Thomas D.
Riordan, responded to the subpoena and
appeared before Mayor Schmitz yesterday

Mahony refused to be sworn or to make â¢

Relatives of Captain Mclntyre . residing
here have abandoned all hope. that he
reached one of the numerous Islands and
have given him up as lost. Because of
the information they have received rela
tive to the conduct of the crew and which
they refuse to make public at present they
will a rigid investigation of tho
wreck by the Canadian authorities. They
declare that sensational developments will
be brought out.-
The greatest confusion prevailed when
the vessel struck and it was "every man
for. himself." If such had not been the
case all would have been saved.
One member of the crew 13 reported to
have said in Ketchikan that Captain Mc
lntyre had gone Into fcls room to get his
bird and dog. When he came out tha
crew had taken to the boats. This sailor
made a rush and succeeded in getting
into one of the boats and thereby saved
his life. That was the last seen of those
who remained on the BristoL
Seaman's Account of Wreck.
Captain Wallace further declared that
he could . not decide, from the various
stories, when the vessel struck, so ha
cruised around the various reefs and at
no place could he find wreckage or any
thing to indicate a disaster. The weather
was clear and with glasses he could dis
cern anything a distance of ten miles.
When the boats were rescued by tho
Cottage City Mate Smith gave an account
of the mishap differing from the one he
related at Ketchikan, where the survivors
were landed, and while in this city ha
gave several versions of the disaster to
relatives . of Captain Mclntyre and to
newspaper men. Captain Wallace says
that when he 'picked up the crew no two
of the men told the same story relative
to the last moments on board the Bristol
before they deserted her, and not one of
them could give an intelligent account aÂ»
to the place. where the vessel struck.
When the survivors arrived here Chief
Officer Smith said that the seven men
were preparing to launch a lifeboat when
the last survivors lett the wreck. Accord
ing to the reports brought by the Cottage
City the Bristol carried only four boats
and a small skiff and either one of the
large boats would have carried the entiro
crew of twenty-eight men. It is the opin
ion : of Captain .Wallace I of , the Cottaga
City that as soon as' the vessel struck
there was a general scramble for the
boats. The first boat to leave contained
fourteen men, the second five and the
third only two, leaving seven men to lower
the big lifeboat, which was turned bot
tom up and securely lashed to the deck.
Before it could be lowered the ship went
down, carrying the unfortunates with It.
Conflicting- Stories Are Told.
The statements of Captain Wallace of
the Cottage City throw new light on the
manner in which Captain Mclntyre and
other officers of the Bristol met death
when that vessel crashed on the rocks
near Dixon entrance on January 2.
PORT TOWNSEND, Jan. 15.â The death
of Captain James Mclntyre, Pilot Roberts,
Chief Engineer Vivian, Third Engineer
Edwards, Oiler Hurlbut, Second Steward
Roemer and Joseph Silva of the steam
ship Bristol was due to the cowardice of
the crew, who took all the available
boats and left these seven without means
of escape. This is the substance of the
stories told here to-day by the captain
and seamen of the steamship Cottage

John Hutton was recalled to the stand
this morning. Spencer for the defensa say
ing he wished to ask a few more queÂ«
.tions. Replying to. them,' Hutton said that
so far as he knew no one joined the body

oners were confined, arM that the lynch

Hutton was leaving the stand Raker re
"Suppose Mr. Hutton.be allowed to go
when and where he pleases now?"
"He always has been," said Post.
The defense has asserted^ many times
that Hutton was restrained of his liberty
and kept under guard. Raker's remark
drew â¢ thunder from the clouds ana a
stormy session of the court followed.

Yantis and Martin Wilson, was ; then
Raker objected to Morris*. being allowed
to take the stand, on the ground that
Morris was a cpconsplrator and therefore.
taot entitled to testify. The objection was
overruled. Raker remarked that every
time the defense made an objection the
court silenced counsel before the objec
tion was completed. Judge Harrington
said :
"Raker, you hush or you'll get it."
"Get what. Judge?" asked Raker.
"I'll put you in jail, that's what." r
His Honor referred to the defense, and
Raker in particular, as the '-irascible
counsel," at:d said: . .â¢
"Raker, I'll give you anything on Gods
earth if you ask for it, if it's within the
law." " ' Â¦ Â¦ ,
Raker told Deputy Attorney General
George Sturtevant to proceed with the
witness. Â¦ ; - _ 'Â¦*
"Thank God," exclaimed Sturtevant,
and Raker retorted:
"Thank some one nearer to youâ some
closer friend." â¢ Â¦
Morris was asked as to his acquaintance
and Intimacy with certain members of the
lynching party. To all of such questions
the defense objected and was' overruled.
Raker objected on the grounds that the
statements of the witness were in direct
contradiction to the evidence previously
given, and that his testimony was given
under the promise or the hope of Immu
nity from punishment. â¢..Â¦ -^
Morris told of the meeting at Trow
bridge's store, of James Brown's (the de
fendant) invitation to him to join in the
lynching party and of his refusal at first
to take part in it Later he accepted the
proposition on the statement of Brown'
that there had been many lynchings with
out the participants being punished.
Raker objected to every question and said
that the defense entered objections so that
the court would not - say later that cer
tain lines of testimony had not been ob
"You're granted your objections, by all
that's heavenly!" exclaimed the court.
Corroborates Huttbn's Story.
Raker later objected on the ground that
Sturtevant was asking questions in a
manner to "educate the witness" and the
court ruled that 2 the prosecution must
frame its questions in a different man
ner. , - "
Amid many objections, Morris told of
the meeting at the schoolhouse, substan
tially -as it had been described by' Hutton,
his co-conspirator. The court overruled
all the objections and remarked : that
Raker was not happy unless he injected
bile and venom into every tHing he had to
say. Raker called attention to the great
similarity of language used by Hutton and
Morris, the latter' s answers to some ques
tions being exactly as given by Hutton. â¢
When it came to the testimony regard
ing the wagon spokes brought in by the
country party, for the town party on
the night of the lynching, the prosecution
ordered the clerk to bring In a handful of
wagon spokes. This brought forth strenu
ous objection from the defense on the
ground that the court was allowing the
prosecution to bring in illustrative evU
dence in the face of the denial of the .ap
plication of the defense to bring in evi
dense of a similar nature. Raker said
that the witness .would .testify to'any
thing suggested by the prosecution. Judge
Harrington arose from his chair and ex-
RakerV incurred; the displeasure ' of -the
court by objecting to.the court suggesting
a question. The Judge said: ', . :
..."I- have a commitment prepared
against you and the first thing you know
I will send you to jail ' for the full extent
of the lawâ five days.'.' $ .-Â¦:Â¦ \ .;...-
Spencer asked' Morris if he . remembered
certain testimony * that he had given in
court last week, to which the prosecution
objected, saying that -the record was the
best evidence as to what the witness had
testified and that the 'record should be
j read to' him.'.-. Raker declared' that Morris'
testimony- then ; was - diametrically', oppo
site to his testimony on the stand to-day.
Spencer, claimed, that, a > reading of the
record to him would be for the education
of the witness. ; . ; .' . ., : - .-, Â¦; â¢â¢'
Â¦;. The -court ..ordere'd Spencer to proceed
on some other ; line and ordered ;, the re

.wished 'to inquire. ' â¢Â¦Â¦â¢ ' Â¦ ' :
. Raker . caused another â¢ disturbance Â¦ by
asking: "Won't the witness be all fixed
up by to-morrow morning?"
'.The. court ordered him to'- stop making
such offensive. remarks. ''-'-*--'.
. . Morris was . asked if the men : hanged

When the afternoon : session began.
Spencer requested - the ' court to .permit
Raker to take up .the. cross-examination
of Morris, as Raker's peculiar knowledge
of the case best fitted him in the defense
of his client, James. W. Brown. Judge
Harrington denied the request, saying he
had excluded Raker from cross-examina
tion. Raker remarked that he could" not
conceive why , the court should - attempt
to : control the defense and asserted his
belief that the court had no authority to
designate as to who should examine a
witness. - ' "^ -
Spencer took up' the examination : and
at once made an application that the tes
timony of the witness be stricken out,
as he was - a conspirator. , The - applica
tion-was denied and an exception . taken.
Spencer inquired as to the . character, and
relations between . the. father â¢ of -Morris
(since deceased) and -Mr. * TTowbridge at
the time of the Jynchlng.v This :: fact
brought out that the two, men were very
unfriendly and that the witness partici
pated in the -enmity; 1 " which*.' was occa
sioned by business differences. .. Â¦â¢' - "-'-..â¢'.
â¢ Later Morris was asked whether he had
made * arrangements for a ' room at \ the
Grand Central Hotel, had paid his bill at
the hotel or had made Â« any ! arrangement
regarding its pay, to which he ; replied
"No,"-- but .that he ; expected; to" pay his
bill. These questions Â¦ were : objected to
and Spencer said: â¢'Â¦' "â¢â¢.'
"We desire to show that the- witness Is
here without any, expense to himself." ','-
Morris said that - he and 'Â¦Â¦ Hutton . had,

Officers Seak Assignment..
German naval officers are eager for as
signments to accompany Prince Henry to
the United States and many young noble
, men are bringing influence to bearto ob
tain appointments for this duty. The list
of possible - appointments is already sev
eral times larger than' the suite which can
be sent with Prince Henry. This pressure
to secure places may -cause the Prince s
suite to be enlarged. The lack of accom
modations for a Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ number of persons on
board the Hohenzollern is the real reason
-why Prince Henry does not sail on the
imperial yacht. .'. ; f -Â¦',",
: Emperor William has occasionally told
Americans' that he would like to visit the
United States and he still desires to do
so But there is not the least probability
of his gratifying this desire as reasons of
state imperatively forbid his leaving Ger
many for the period of time required to go
to the United States, Just as the duties of
President Roosevelt would prevent him
from visiting Germany. . ; - \

WASHINGTON, Jan.. 15.â Dr. von Hol

Berlin giving the dates of arrival and de

on the Kron Prinz Wilhelm on February

respecting the coming visit to. the United
States of Prince Henry of Germany. The

PASADENA. Jan. 15.â Mme. Gertrude
d'Ajuria operated in this city about a
year ago. She defrauded local merchants
out of several thousand dollars. She came
here from no one knew where and hired
stylish apartments at the Hotel Green,
the leading tourist hotel.- She was a fine
looking woman, well appearing and well
spoken and she had with her a little child
who was afflicted with St. Vitus dance.
After staying at the Green a short time
she rented a house at 196 South Los
Robles avenue. â¢ The hotel people' had
heard of the madame's operations else
where, and becoming suspicious of her,
ordered her out. She claimed to be an
Italian Countess and she opened a studio
at her home, where she received orders
for miniature paintings, claiming to have
painted miniatures of many prominent
people. The madame was very extrava
gant. She purchased much Jewelry, furni
ture and clothes. She had charged to her
account everything she purchased. Bar
ter Bros., furniture dealers of Los Ange
les; Glasscock & Vroman, stationers; W.
J. Pierce, jeweler, and the Hotel Green
were among the heaviest losers, though
almost every prominent merchant in the
-city lost more or less. After working
everybody in the city whom she could the
madame suddenly left town, packing in
her trunks her movable values and leav
ing what she could not conveniently
carry. Even her pet dog and chickens
were left behind. These were "attached
and an attempt was made to locate the
woman, but it was unavailing. She was
once seen in New York afterward, but she
never communicated with Pasadena. It
was learned after her, disappearance that
she was not an artist as she claimed, but
had others fill the orders for miniatures
which she secured.

MOUNT VERNON. N. Y.. Jan. 15.â
Mme. d'Ajuria would not be seen by re
porters to-day, but to a Mount ' Vernon
/ tradesman who called on her she said:
/ "I am going to have my case against
Russell Sage tried by my lawyer and not
by the newspapers. Mr. Sage owes me
that money and I am going to have it.
He Is the meanest old skinflint that ever
lived." \
The report that Mme. d'AJuria is soon to
leave Mount Vernon was declared by her
to-day to Â¦ be untrue. She says she will
remain there until spring and then go to
Europe. .; Â¦Â¦>-Â¦ < . Â¦Â¦>Â» 'Â¦.-:,
I&W YORK. Jan. 15.â Isabella d'AJuria,
who has sued Russell Sage for $75,000. is
not new to the courts of this State. It is
admitted by her counsel that the present
is not the first action at law she has taken
against the aged financier.
Isabella d'AJuria was born in England
about forty-five years ago. Her father's
name was Saalfield and by that name she
was known until she -took the title of
marchioness. Eugene F. Daly, a lawyer",
with an office at K9 Broadway, In the
spring of 1Â£S7 brought suit against Sage on
behalf of "Isabella Saalfield," who as
serted that a large sup was due her as
a result of speculations in which she had
been engaged. She said that Sage had
acted as her speculative guide and finan
cial philosopher, but failed her as a friend.
Now the question arises, are there two
Isabella Saaltlelds? Have they both had
suits against Russell Sage?
It is said by the "marchioness" that she
was married to Marquis Gregoria d'Ajuria
In "Sat. This leaves the suit under the
name of Saalfield to be explained. Daly
said to-day that he recalled having
brought suit against Kussell Sage for
"Isabella Saalfield" in 1&7. He said that
the case never came to trial, his client
having disappeared without notifying him
of her intentions. Daly was unable to
identify the portrait of the Alarchiones3
Isabella d'Ajuria as that of his former
client. Isabella Saalneld.
Sage would say nothing more about the
suit than that he had been sued I once
before by the same woman. He. admitted
that the previous suit might have been
brought in the name of "Isabella Saal
field." y. .
Says Sage Is a Skinflint.

t>r. Ramsdell In commenting on catarrh cures
says: "I "can heartily recommend Stuart's
Catarrh Tablets, because they containNio co-
caine nor' other dangerous drug found in so
many advertised catarrh cures. I have known
of many cases of long standing catarrh of the
head and. throat completely cured by the- dally
use of these tablets for several weeks. One
case In particular, which " I â¢Â¦ could not reach
with an inhaler or spray and where the catarrh
caused daily headaches and a noticeable loss of
hearing, was entirely cared by this harmless
but effective remedy.'.' ' '
Dr. "Walnwright says: "I never hesitate to
prescribe Stuart's Catarrh Tablets for catarrhal
headaches and catarrhal deafness because I
know them to be perfectly safe for child or
adult and have seen many remarkable cures
resulting from their regular dally use; because
they are advertised and" sold in drug stores
Is no reason why any good physician should not
use them, because we should seize upon the
means ot cure "wherever found."
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are especially valu-
able for catarrhal colds in children â¢ because
they are pleasant to the taste and may be used
freely to > break up severe colds and croup at

"You are trying to put my client on
trial, though no charges have been, filed,"
Riordan said.
"If your client,".' the manager- of- The
Call interposed, "will ewear that he did
not 6ign that contract, we .will: see that
ctarsesare regularly preferred. "
Randall Denies Charg-es.
C. "W. Randall, manager of the Wake
lee Drug Company and who appealed to
the courts to restrain Walter M. Willett,
assistant manager of the firm, from en
forcing the payment of a loan of $16,000
made to the drug company by his wife.
Viola Willett, filed an affidavit yesterday
in which he denies the allegations made
in the affidavit filed by Willett. The last
named accused Randall of conducting the
business in such a manner that a loss fol
lowed, and also accused the manager of
appropriating the firm's money to his own
private uses.
The County ) Clerk's .attorney was . anx
ious . yesterday, that the case against .his
client be exposed in all its detail;' though
denying to the Mayor the right or; privi
lege of questioning Mahony. : Neither - the
Mayor nor his attorney, nor the manager
of The Call was willing that suchau ad
vantage', be given the accused, and:." In
consequence the evidence adduced of
Mahony's. guilt was but' a fragment of
that held by the witnesses. â¢
Flood denied In the investigation yes
terday any remembrance of drawing up
or witnessing the particular contract re
ferred to by The Call. When he so tes
tified he lied and he knew he was lying.
He knows that he admitted to the man
ager of The Call that he drew the con
tract and signed it as a witness, and told
who the others were that signed. Itviand
that he later made the same admissions
to a'Call reporter. 'â¢ â¢ Â¦"Â¦'.'!Â¦
Mahony does not deny directly the .ex
istence of the contract Riordan will riot
deny it. Flood, the stenographer who
drew up the contract, dare not deny it.
W. A. Deane will admit his full knowl
edge of it and others who have seen It
will add their testimony. The contract
itself will be produced. in whatever, court
Riordan and Mahony elect to trust their
case.' . .- 'â¢ Â¦ " .-":"
Riordan protested further that the
Mayor was seeking to place his client
on trial without charges having been filed.
Mayor Schmitz said grave charges had
been made in the columns of The Call, and
he had given Mr. Mahony an opportunity
to deny under oath the truth of the al
legations. He was anxious only to get at
the facts that he might be guided to
proper action. The manager of The Call,
who was present. Importuned Riordan to
let his client be sworn that he might
deny, if he could, having signed the con
tract which he delivered to W. A. Deane,
and promised if such denial were made to
file at once specific charges against Ma
hony. Riordan would not permit his client
to be sworn, nor to, answer the direct
question- of the Mayor. The attorney
himself made a statement, asserting that
his client had "signed no contract in vio
lation of the law." Asked by Mayor
Schmitz if he would deny that his client
had signed the contract specified by The
Call, Riordan said that he would assert
only that Mahony had not signed any
contract in violation of the law.
2Â£nyor Anxious to Know Facts.
Mayor's jurisdiction over qualifications
and the acts of the County; . Clerk on two
grounds. He contends that:- the County
Clerk is not a municipal officer and can
not be removed by . the 1 Mayor, in view
of the Supreme Court decision in Crowley
versus Freud. He holds "further that,
granted the Mayor's right^to interfere, the
alleged offenses were committed . prior to
Mahony's election and prior also to
Mayor Schmitz's assumption of the duties
of office, and therefore are not subject to
investigation by the Mayor. â¢ ' .
When Mayor Schmitz interposed at the
investigation yesterday with the assertion
that if the law had been violated by the
signing of an ante-election contract and
the subsequent distribution of offices as
reward for support during the campaign,
the charter surely gave him power to act,
Riordan had another bolt ready. Granted
that the distribution of rewards, as per
contract, would be an offense falling
under the Mayor's jurisdictionâ so Rior
dan's argument ranâ the alleged contract
had not been carried out. Signing the
contract was in violation of the purity of
elections law, a State offense only, and
not until the terms of the alleged contract
were carried out could the Mayor, Rior
dan argued, have the slightest claim to
authority to remove Mahony from office.

schmitz ays accused.
Attorney General Tirey L. Ford says
that it was with the consent of his offlce
that the Railroad Commissioners at their
last meeting selected Attorney Short to
represent that body In the litigation fa
miliarljv known as the "oil rate cases."
He was selected because of his intimate
acquaintance with the circumstances em
braced in the controversy. The Attorney
General's office always represents the
Railroad Commission in matters affecting
that body and -will be assisted in the pres
ent instance by Mr. Short. Mr. Ford says
this course is not an unusual one.
Short's Appointment .Satisfactory.
After brooding over the possibility of
a long sentence in the penitentiary John
Iverson, the Mendocino stage robber,
who Is confined In the County Jail, at
tempted to commit suicide Tuesday night
by swallowing a Quantity of opium.
Shortly after he had taken the drug a
guard discovered his condition and noti
ned the night Jailer.
Without waiting to summon a doctor
the jailer hastily prepared an emetic of
mustard and warm water" and forced it
down Iverson's throat. The prisoner was
then taken from his -cell and. assisted by
one of the guards, was compelled to
Â¦walk the corridor for several hours, so
that ho could not fall asleep.
As he seemed to have been relieved of
the opium effects Iverson was then re
turned to his cell and a watch placed
on him.
Iverson Is a United States prisoner.
While driving a stage in Mendocino
County he conceived the bold plan of
holding up another stage which was sup
posed to carry a large amount of money.
On the day of the robbery Iverson took
out his stagâ¬ to make the run from Wil
letts to Fort Bragg. When about half
way between the two places he put up
his horses and started out to hold up
the stage wnich was due in Fort Bragg
about the same time he was supposed to
reach there. Iverson wore a gunnysack
as a mask, and as the stage came -up he
commanded the driver at the point of
a sawed-off shotgun to throw up His
hands. He then ordered the passengers
to alight, and after lining them up he
compelled them to give up their money
and valuables. Not content with rob
bing them he forced the driver to throw
off the mail and the treasure-box. After
rifling the mail he tossed the empty bag
back to the driver and ordered him to
get. The treasure-box was found short
)}â¢ afterward near the scene of the hofd
up, but the contents were gone.
As soon as the robbery was reported to
the authorities an investigation was
commenced. Iverson was sent for and as
he told several contradictory statements
he was placed under surveillance. After
a thorough investigation the crime was
iastened upon him and he was placed un
der arrest.
Since being locked up in the County
Jail Iverson has been melancholy be
cause of the thought of haying to spend
the rest of his life behind prison bars.
How he managed to get. the opium
which he used In trying to end bis exist
ence is a mystery to the Sheriff and his
deputies. It is thought, however, â¢ that
the drug was .given to Iverson by one of
the Chinese inmates of the jail.
Iverson's trial Is set for next week in
the United States Court.

"I asked him if Mr. Leake had repeat
ed the wording of the contract to him
and he replied. 'Why, yes; he* knows it
almost word^for word.' There was no
doubt about Flood's statements to me
that night. He was going out to see
Mahony to tell him that The Call had

that The Call had the whole inside of

hony would appoint Deane to the posi
tion as he had agreed to do* before elec
tion. He told me that Mr. Leake knew
that he had signed the contract and
could repeat its language almost word
for word.
could hear Mahony "say that he would
appoint Deane his chief deputy, thinking
that If Mahony agreed to do this the
story, would not appear In The Call..
"Flood seemed to be under the im
pression that if Mahony lived up to his
agreement The Call would suppress the
scandal. I called a cab and on the way
to Alahony's house on .Hill street we had
plenty of time to talk. During the con
versation on the way out Flood
talked very .freely. He first, asked
me if I knew the story, and
when I told him I knew all the details
he. had no hesitancy about discussing
the subject. He admitted having ; signed
the document and told me he had--ad
mitted it also to Mr. Leake.
SOME OF THE PERSONS IN
TERESTED IN THE MAHONY
INVESTIGATION. '
"Mr. Flood came down to The Call busi
ness office Monday night in â¢ response to a
message from Mr. Leake. : He went into
the private office with Mr. Leake and had
quite a long talk with him. I was stand-
Ing outside waiting, and when the talk
was ended Mr. Leake came outside and
told me that Flood had "corroborated; the
story that Mahony had signed a contract
to retain- Deane as his chief deputy and
that- Flood -had drawn it;up and- wit
nessed it. Â¦ â¢ r : .
"Flood, was -still in the private office and
Mr.' Leake; told me that Flood had asked
him' to send a reporter with . him to Ma
hony's house, where . he . intended ; to' ; ad
vise - Mahony to live : up : to his > contract."
Mr. : Leake told me to go with Flood and
see what came off between them. - Flood
wanted ' the reporter, with him so that he
Flood's Admissions to Leake.
- "I did â¢ not â¢ make any special effort , to
listen. I simply remained in my seat in
the hallway, and' as I knew, the details of
Flood's story very vividly I could not help
but catch the drift of the talk. In order
that I may be - clearly understood X I will
narrate the details of how I happened to
go to Maliony's house. ">
. "John Flood had been in private con
sultations with:. Mahony .fully ten or fif
teen minutes before Mahony talked with
me, and Flood told hlpi that The Call had
the Inside information about 'Â¦ the'docu-.
ment, and Mr. Leake had told him that It
would.be published in .the paper the fol
lowing morning.- â¢Â¦ I heard the conversa
tion between Flood and Mahony quite
distinctly. I was sitting in , the . hallway
outside the room where the conversation
took place, and as Flood talked; in ani
mated tones I could not â¢Â¦ help but ' hear
what was said. - - .' .-
"To the' best of my recollection nothing
specifically was mentioned' about the con
tract itself. I may have mentioned the
contract myself, but I don't remember
that Mahony did. The subject-matter, of
the conversation was clearly understood
by myself and Mr. Mahony. Â¦Â¦. â¢./>- :,
"Before the publication of the story?"
"Was there anything, mentioned about
the Â¦written agreement between Mr.
Deane and Mr. Mahony whereby the lat
ter was to retain Deane as his chief
deputy in the event of his election?"-
"Did you have any conversation with
Mr. Mahony concerning the matter under
Investigation?"
"Yes, sir," Britt answered.
"Where did the conversation take
place?"
."At Mr. Mahony's house."
"Before or after the publication of The
Call's charges?"
William F. Britt of The Call staff' fol
lowed Flood on the stand: Mayor Schmitz
took the witness in hand and asked: *
Reporter Takes the Stand.
"Well, I don't mean that I drew up con
tracts like the one â the one the papers are
talking about now. I had lots of circulars
and things to send out and I had lots of
writing to do about that time, and I don't
remember much what I did."
"No, sir."
: "What did you mean by saying that
you drew up many contracts during the
campaign?" asked Ruef. .
"No, sir, I don't remember it. If I saw
the contract I could tell better. I will
not say positively that I did not sign it.
If my name is to the contract I will not
deny my signature." * -
"Did you ever draw up any other con
tracts to keep men in the County Clerk's
office?" asked Ruef.
"I cannot testify about this contract
until, I have seen it," said Flood In re
sponse to a question by the Mayor.
"Did you sign this contract made" by
Mahony to retain Mr. Deane as his chief
clerk?" asked Mayor Schmitz.
The manager of The Call . was sworn.
He recited in general the evidence that
had come into his possession of Mahony' s
illegal acts. He repeated the terms of the
contract, the names of the parties to iL
and the witnesses. He told where the
contract was. at 12 o'clock yesterday, and
gave the names, of several reputable citi
zens who had seen the document. The
witness stated that The Call was not a
public prosecutor and had not filed
charges, its duty haying been fulfilled in
the publication of the information it had
secured. He declined to go further into
detail, since Mahony refused to recognize
the Mayor's Investigation as * valid, and
further statement would only serve as-in
formation on which the accused's attor
ney could prepare his defense.
John Flood, who was the stenographer
to County Clerk Deane, and who drew
up the. document and signed it as a wit
ness, was sworn. He denied point blank
at first that he ever discussed the con
tract with anybody or admitted that he
drew it up. . -

"Did you admit to Britt or Mr. Leaks
that your name was on .that contract?"
"I did not deny that it was.- I wanted
to. see the contract, and If -I had signed
it I would not He. about It."
"Now, Mr. Flood, "..queried the Mayor,
"that was an important and strange docu
ment. You knew It was a crime to make
a contract of that kind, and do you mean
to testify that you have no recollection of
having drawn it up, or signed it?"
â¢â¢""It will; not -say- that, I did not sign the
contract.- If I caw the contract I could
answer more truthfully. . I draw up many
papers, but, this one-may have been dic
tated 1 to me." : "
"Well, your Honor, I did." â¢
"Then why . "did ' you ; testify that you
had not discussed the subject with any
body?" asked the Mayor curtly.' â¢ .-â¢ '
"Well, I didn't mean to say that, your
Honor; I have talked about this to many
people. Lots of people have asked me
about .the contract," Flood replied.
"I impressed upon his mind that it "was
a peculiar thing that he wouldn't remem
ber the ,. wording of a document of that
kind; a document which, guaranteed his
friend Deane a berth in the office, and.
he said, 'Well, when that contract was
made last October Bert Mahony and
Deane and myself were all the best of
friends and I never dreamed that they
would fall out and that this thing would
come out.* " .".â¢â¢â¢
At this juncture Mayor Schmitz ordered
his messenger to recall Flood j and have
Britt's testimony read to him.
Mayor Schmitz Â¦ ordered, the official
stenographer to read Britt's testimony to
Flood. This being done Mayor Schmitz
asked:
* - "Did you or did you not, Mr. Flood, dis
cuss this contract with Mr. Britt?" â¢"&<*;
"I asked him if he didn't remember the
exact wording of the contract and he said,
â¢That contract was nothing to me.- I was
not ' mentioned I in â¢ it. Mahony did not
promise to take care of me and I don't
remember the way It" was worded.' ;
"I had another talk with Mr. Flood last
night. He did not talk as freely then as
he did on Monday night., He did not,
however, deny any of the statements he
made'to me the night before. He was a
little less communicative and was a bit
particular â¢ as to which â¢ contract | he was
being questioned about. He wanted to see
the contract. He said he made so many
that he didn't know which one I was talk
ing about I told him the only contract
I knew anything about was the one made
by Mahony , to retain ! Deane. He did not
deny making the contract. . The burden of
his complaint was that he wanted to see
the contract. .
Flood Beats Around the Bush.
â¢ "I simply wanted to satisfy myself that
the story of the contract was straight
and I was satisfied. .When I got back to
the office I rang Mahony up as per prom
ise and he told me that he would appoint
Deane his chief deputy. 'I will do any
thing you want,' he said, 'but for God's
sake keep that story out of the paper."
When Flood and myself left the house
I told Flood that Mahony, shied too much
at the proposition of whether or not he
intended: to fulfill the contract with
Deane, so I sent Flood back to ask him
the point blank question whether he in
tended to carry out his written promise.
"I walked down to the cab and Flood
went back to a3k Mahony the question.
When^ Flood came back he said: 'Mahony
told me he would appoint Deane his 1 chief
clerk and he wanted you 'to be present -so
you could hear him.' I told Â¦ Flood that
it was not necessary for me to bear him.
"At this time was the contract men
tioned?" asked the Mayor. . - .
"Not that I remember," replied the wit

Declares That Mayor Has Power to
Remove County Officials.
A. Kuef, " attorney for Mayor Schmitz,
In an interview last night said:
"The points made by the friends of Ma
hony-and those who oppose thÂ©-investiga
tion by Mayor Schmitz may be sum
marized^as follows:
"Firstâ The Mayor has no jurisdiction
BUEF GIVES HIS OPINION".
"No, sir," answered Britt. "He madi
no denial of it to me,"-
At this point in the proceedings Mayo:
Schmitz adjourned the investigation unti
this afternoon at 2 o'clock.
O. H .. H ,, I ,, H .. I .,H I I I I I H-M-M-H- +
because he is a municipal officer and Jla
hony is a county official, and the Mayor
has therefore no right to suspend a
county official.
"Secondâ The Mayor has no right to
act because the offense, If any, happened
before the Mayor took office, and nÂ© can
only investigate matters that have hap
pened or may happen during his term of
office. -
"In my opinion neither position is ten
able and as to these questions of law I
shall so advise the Mayor and leave to
him the sole determination of the facts
and their sufficiency. The Mayor is a
broad-minded, honorable man, of Keen per
ception and good intellect, and will deal
Justly with all questions brought before
him wltnout prejudice or favor. I know
that he has no predisposition in this case
either way.
"The contention that the Mayor has no
Jurisdiction to investigate these charges
because the Mayor is a municipal officer
and the County Clerk a county officer is
based on what is known as the civil ser
vice decision to fix what is known as
civil service qualifications for county of
fices. This decision proceeds on the
theory that as the constitutional amend
ment known as section SVfe of article XI
; makes It competent for charters in con
. solldated cities and counties to provide
for the manner, in time and term for
which county officers shall be â¢ elected,
without making any reference to quali
fications, that it is not competent for
city . charters to provide civil . service
qualifications for county officers.
"But this section of the constitution ex
pressly provides for fixing the terms of
county officers in charters. The term of
county officers Is fixed at two years, with
the express and distinct provision that it
may be cut off at any time for cause.
This provision as to . removal is equally
potent with the provision fixing the term
at two years, and If the cause exists the
term extends only to the time in the de
termination by the Mayor that such cause
does exist. The provision for removal is
a part of the charter provision defining
the term of county officers.
"As to the right of the Mayor to in
vestigate charges which relate to occur
rences happening before the induction
Into office, there can be no question. Out
side of the question as to the execution
during an official's, term aa fo illegal con
tract entered Into before his term which
would be in violation of law and would
subject him to removal, there cannot be
the least doubt. But that for any crime,
felony or misconduct occurring before the
taking of office an elected official may be
removed thereafter, there can be no
doubt.
"As for example, if a county officer had
embezzled a large sum of money, say
thirty days before assuming the func
tions of office, and had succeeded In con
cealing the fact until after he had en
tered Into office and the embezzlement
had thereupon been discovered, it is ab
solutely certain that no court or authority
would support the contention that the
mere delay of thirty days in the discovery
of that crime would assure that official's
retention in office." *r\ , : .

'-Dr. Daniels, winner of first, is a hand
some, wide-ranging dog, which hunts his
ground with ease and judgment and is
high class in every particular. His work
has shown' he is the equal of many of the
Eastern pointers, and it is likely he will
be sent on the circuit next year.
Â¦ Pearl's. Jingle Is- also stylish and wide
ranging and runs with a high head, al-,
though not as fast as Dr. Daniels. The
two setters. Peach Blossom and Northern
Huntress, are very much alike in color
and size.- They can hardly be .distin
guished one from the other while in ac
tion.* Blossom, â¢ however, has a bit the'
best of Huntress in style and seems a
trifle more earnest jn her work, otherwise
there seems little to choose between them.
As -the running closed- at an early ..hour,
Messrs. Van . Arsdale, Bagby, Payne and
Judge Balmer. spent some time shooting
before leaving the- trial grounds for San
ta Maria. -. It has been decided not to have
a members' stake this year. As the trials
were finished earlier than expected, most
of the visitors will spend to-morrow in
shooting. H. W. Keller of Santa Monica
and F.. Emery of Los Angeles arrived to
day, but did not reach the grounds in
time to see any of the work. Taken as a
whole, the trials have been .fairly suc
cessful. While It- is true that birds were
sometimes .scarce,' It was due to- the dry
spell and consequent lack of feed which
has made them .change within the last
few days to other localities.

The Successful Competitors.
After a' few moments' intermission the
judge called for Peach Blossom and
Northern Huntress.' This heat was one
of the most Interesting of the day, as a
cool breeze was blowing, and the dogs,
despite their previous work, were in fine
fettle. Several points were secured by
each and they were in every Instance
steady to wing and shot. Plenty of birds
were found, although many of them flush
ed wild,- but there were 'enough which
lay well to the dogs "to give- a thorough
test of .theit â¢ta.bfttty.j They " were Â¦ kept
down rather* Jbnser-Mihan the others for
the reason, as it afterward developed, the
Judge was trying to.decidcbetween them,
but was unable to do so, After calling
the dogs up Secretary Betz made the an
nouncement as to the. result of the all
age," which was as follows: .
Fan Go,' the bye dog of yesterday, and
Lady were down for the next heat in the
same cover worked by the first brace.
Fan Go was not in the best condition and
did not show- what she is capable, of doing
under other circumstances. Lady was in
better form than yesterday and hunted
her ground with good judgment and se
cured two points before being called up.
This closed the second series.
The next brace down were Peach Blos
som and Pearl's Jingle. They were cast
off- on the hillside near scattered birds
and were credited with one point each
during the heat. There was little to choose
between the two so far as speed was con
cerned and while Jingle showed the best
range Blossom was the more stylish.
This brace, like others during the day,
were down about one hour.
Peach Blossom a Stylish Worker.
Count's ( Mark and Northern Huntress
went down for the next heat and before
going a quarter of a mile ran together
into a bevy which flushed rather wild.
Immediately after Huntress pointed a
small bunch of birds which had not
flushed and Count nailed a single almost
at the same moment. In speed and range
Huntress had clearly, the best of the heat
and- a shade the better of the point work.
The nrst brace, down were Dr.. Daniels
and Cuba Jr. A bevy of birds was flushed
shortly after the dogs were cast off which
apparently should have been discovered
by one or both of the pointers, but the
wind was not in their tavor. The birds
were flushed by the handlers and were
followed into a little valley, where Dr.
Daniels pointed two lying close together.
Cuba did not' show well and ran in rather
a listless fashion, being outclassed by his
opponent/ The dogs were ordered up at
the end of an hour, no other birds having
been found.
The grounds were -'unlike those to .which
most oi the"' field trial men have been ac
customed, as they:, were quite â¢ hilly, but'
with splendid cover, prevailing. -." It was
impossiDle to follow the dogs Â¦ with teams,!
so the spectators .on < foot. ; Not
much walking was riecessaryj-as at times
they could see an entire heat from some
elevated point. The day was ideal for
neld trials, and the j dogs^- worked more
satisfactorily than at any time during the
meeting."- ' : u v .

Judging from prices: it looked as if bet
tors would buy npthlng but The Pride
when speculating began on the seven fur
long purse run. Tom Ryan's horse closed
an even-money chance. After delaying the
start for some time he broke away in the
lead. Â¦ Joined by May W the pair raced
off on nearly equal terms to the stretch,
where the favorite began to stop. At this
stage it looked as if May W would score,
when O'Connor on Sly came fast on the
outside, winning by three â¢ lengths in
1:26V2. May W found the pace too warm,
for The Fretter ran in before her for place
honors. -
Wyoming, an 11 to 10 favorite, was never
headed in the concluding mile selling run.
As the wire was approached Commis
sioner Forster closed strongly. â¢ losing by
only a neck. ,Ishtar, another, three-year
old, ran third. â¢ - .
When once. before Thaddeus and Orfeo
met the former met with some poor racing
luck and lost the decision by a scant
margin. In the two-year-old event yes
terday he turned the tables on the Mac
donough entry, winning all the way at
odds of 7 to 10. : Somenos a 75 to 1 shot,
ran third,- four lengths behind Orfeo.
Caesar Young's fast filly Tower of Can
dles gave the slip to a bunch of speedy
ones, in the , six furlong selling event,
touching the wire in 1:13 flat. 'Lee Jack
son took her out, in front and, setting
a hot pace, she" beat Sir Hampton, a 12
to 1 outsider,: half a lengrth. - Ransch on
Rollick, the secon* choice, took the show.
Pupil made his first start at the meeting.
-Bob Smith's chestnut . horse Marshal
Neil furnished the first, disappointment.
Played down to 9 to 10 lathe betting on
the Futurity course sprint, .he finished
third with Bullman, swerving badly the
last part under punishment. Afghan, the
second choice, i with Lee Jackson up, won
almost easily from the 15 to 1 outsider
Onyx, piloted by Spencer.
; Four , favorites," Thaddeus, Tower of
Candles, Watercure and Wyoming, gave
good accounts of themselves. Bullman,
O'Connor and Lee Jackson divided saddle
honors, each. piloting two winners.

SORES AMD

Sores and Ulcers never become chronis
unless the blood is in poor condition â is
sluggish, -weak and unable to throw off
the poisons that accumulate in it. The
system nrust be relieved of the unhealthy
matter through the sore, and great danger
to life -would follow should it heal before
the blood has been made pure and healthy
and all impurities eliminated from the sys-
tem. S.S ; S.begin3 the cure by first cleans-

up the general health and removing from

effete^Uei: VPOM THE SYSTEM.
When this has been accomplished the, dis-
charge gradually ceases, and the sore or
ulcer heals. It is the tendency of these old
indolent sores to grow â¢worse and worse,
and eventually to destroy the bones. Local
applications, -while soothing and to some
extent alleviate pain, cannot reach the seat^
of the trouble. S. S. S. does, and nevnatter
how apparently hopeless your condition,
even though your constitution has broken
down, it will bring relief when nothing
else can. It supplies the rich, pure blood
necessary to heal the sore and nourish
the debilitated, diseased body.

broke open the door and found the bed
room'-of the house saturated with .blood.
Mrs. Vencelsick lay dead beside the bed.

heads and bodies covered with cuts . and
gashes, and the husband, almost dead,
were also lying on the floor. Â¦, r .

that Â¦ Vencelsick \ came home intoxicated

rail cutter: The first blow inflicted a gash
on her shoulder and knocked her down,
but --she 'was on her feet again In an In

find in the room she defended herself.,
(The three children were asleep in one
of the beds. The father rushed to the bed
and rained blow -after blow * upon the
sleeping little ones. . The sharp edge of
the cutter hacked the children in a fright
ful . manner, Â¦ and the hospital physicians
say there is very little hope of their re
covery. \ , - Â¦Â¦Â¦'.â¢Â¦
The attack on the children infuriated
the wife, and with a knife in each hand
she sprang at her husband and stabbed
him a number of times. He struck her
several times during the close battle, and
seeing that she was getting weak \ he
brought the cutter down on. her skullVwlth

In the house by the police was locked up.

Ex-Mayer Phelan was Barbour's spon
sor and Brandenstein acquiesced in the
latter's appointment, but now that Phelan
has been retired to private life Branden
stein has transferred his support to Mol
loy. Brandenstein acknowledges that the
work has progressed very sluwiy, but Bar.
bour claims to have made considerable
headway. Barbour points with pride to
his discovery of an absurd ordinance now
on the city's statute books which "pro
hibits the use of masks in the commis
sion of robbery and other crimes," as if a
criminal could escape conviction on the
technicality that he had not used a mask
in the commission of a crime.
The ordinance authorizing the appoint
ment of a clerk to revise the existing or
dinances and to suggest amendments to
the charter will come up for final passage
before the Board of Supervisors next
Monday, and Thomas S. Molloy has been
selected to fill the position. Brandenstein
is the author of the ordinance and has
interested a number of his colleagues in
Molloy's claims. It is certain that Clitus
Barbour. who has held the position for
eleven j months past, will be displaced.
Molloy is a lawyer and has an office in
the same building with Brandenstein.
Molloy is now representing the incumbent
Supervisors in the recount before Judge
Murasky at Brandenstein's behest.
The work of revising the ordinances has
already cost the city sllOO. which was paid
to Barbour as salary. Molloy's appoint
ment will add $400 to the previous cost.
and the work is far from completed, iloi
loy's appointment will be for four months
only, but In this connection it may be
stated that the ordinance passed on Janu
ary 28, 1901, appointing Barbour to the po
eition specified that in no event was his
employment to exceed a period of four
months. When Barbour's four months ex
pired, on May 2S. he was continued as
clerk without further legal action, and his
salary for June was paid out of the ur
gent necessity fund. When the tax budget
was adopted for 1901-1902 an appropriation
of 5600 was made to pay Barbour for six
months more. This six months has ex
pired and Barbour no longer holds the
position.

swashbuckling hero is successful, and
Miss Convere as the heroine is also every
thing that can be expected under the cir
cumstances. "Coralie & Co.'.' follows.
"Claire and the Forgemaster" is pleasing
the patrons of the Urand Opeia-house,
and is being well interpreted by the house
company. Herschel Mayail as Philippe
I>erblay does the right thing by the role
for the most part, and Laura Nelson Hail
is a clever and graceful Ciaire. Next
week will see Edwin Arden in "Don
Caesar de Bazan," with the house com
pany in support.
"Old Jed Prouty," the clever pastoral
play now at the California, is drawing
large houses. Richard Golden's sympa

forms the chief interest of the production
and is one pt the cleverest things of its
kind now on the pastoral stage. Next
comes Frederick Warde, the tragedian,
in a repertoire of classic plays. His open

produced on Sunday night next and re
peated on Monday and Tuesday nights.

Whatever views we take of these . diverse ideas of
a competency and of helpfulness, it is. unquestionable *
that those Americans who have-attained great wealth
have been munificent-in providing help for others in
every way, in vyhich help j is humanly, possible. They"
have built; up great industries ' that . give employment '
to thousands of workingmen at much better wages
than they could' otherwise have obtained: th'ey'have
constitute an ample fortune for a dozen families ac
cording to some other. folks' ideas of a competence."
Mr. Carnegie's idea of helping people is to give them
a public library provided they will maintain it. That
is a most potent help for some peopled but there are
others who wouid starve in sight of a library and*
find no help in its books.
The statement is a platitude, and, like every other !
old familiar doctrine which mankind has heard from
press, pulpit and forum over and over again, it em
bodies a truth in words so vague that one' can.
neither determine exactly it means .nor/. find
fault with it. Wealth, indeed, serves no other pur
pose than that . of providing a competence and en
abling a - man to help others, but what is a compe
tence, who are the others a man is to-help, and how
is the help to, be given? Those are questions whiclr
remain to be answered by each man in his own way.

Tom Reed, once of Maine, but now of New York,
who is rapidly becoming- something like a reminis
cence, -obtained a little society notice the other, day
by giving'a swell dinner to fifteen friends. There was

and it is, therefore, needless to say
that the entertainment was a brilliant
success, as is everything which Mrs. Carr
undertakes.
Some of. the most charming young
ladies in San Francisco society as well
as able men contributed their talents to
help brighten the. evening for the inmates
of the hospital, and their songs were en
thusiastically received by the audience,
which included many visitors. The popu
lar sextet from "Flprodora" was de
lightfully I rendered, and also two scenes
from the opera, "Hansel and Gretel," by
Misses Cuhen, Heath and Sexton.
Mr. Frank Rodoiph, besides singing in
the sextet, gave a- solo, "My Wild Irish
Rose," and was encored. . Mr. Rodoiph,
who made such a decided hit, Is the same
one who is preparing to take his talent3
East and is to give a farewell concert on
tha' 20th of next month at Native Son3*
Hall. Mr. Rosborough's pantomime was
cleverly done and heartily applauded. Mr.
.Arthur Carrlngton gave a - delightful
specialty, including the "Drinking bong."
â¢The last number was purposely omitted
from the -programme as Mrs. Carr had a
surprise in store for the guests. It was
a burlesque on the Florodora sextet en
titled "The Hopkins Doranora," and oc
casioned no end of laughter. The per
formers in s this'. number -were rollicking
students ' from the " Mark Â¦ Hopkins ' Insti

amazingly Â¦ costumed. â¢ .The ladies wore
startling poster 1 effects, in -gowns, coats

Miss Davis, Miss. Deas, Miss 'Noonan,
Miss Garter, Miss Gregg, Miss Brower,
Mr. Layne, Mr. Kuss, Mr.- Dannenberg,
Mr. Keane, Mr. Rixford and Mr. Rogers.
Mrs. , Carr was greatly assisted , In pre

The argument is also made that when we drove"
Spain out of Cuba we shut Cuban products out of
Spain. Even if that were true, it places neither re
sponsibility nor obligation upon us. -The Cubans
shut themselves out of Spain during the revolution
they waged against that country. We ended the revo
lution, and now the junta says we are morally bound
to make good the lost trade with Spain. But what
did that amount to? Cuba's average market in Spain
was worth annually $6,500,000. Grant that is lost to
Cuba, her gain in trade with us of $10,315,000 and
with Europe of $5,520,000 in the same period, a total
of $15,835,000, ought it5"*make good her loss of
$6,500,000 with Spain.
The more-this plea of moral obligation and lost
trade is examined the more impudent it appears.
But unless the American farmers, who have "at stake
the employment of 40,000,000 acres of land and 400,
000 people, are alert, the brazen junta will win and
' pocket the profits which belong to our own tillers
of the soil. /..Â»Â¦Â¦Â¦
anything but an industrial collapse. It shows a very
healthy state of trade.
In eleven months of iooi Cuba's imports fell off
$Sf745>ooo below the same eleven months of 1900, and
her exports in the same time increased $17,383,000.
Adding the two together we have a gain in her com
mercial and financial condition in' that period of
$23,128,000! In that eleven months Cuba sent to the
United States in her products an increase of $10,315,
000. In the same period Cuba's exports to Europe
increased $5,520,000. These are conspicuous and ap
preciable gains. A balance of trade in her favor of
ever $23,000,000 "in the last eleven months indicates
Â¦C~ "As for the first reason, it is bosh. We assumed no
moral obligation to make Cuba prosperous or repair
any of the waste of the futile revolution her people
were carrying on when we rescued them by expelling
Spain. The second reason is an untruthful statement.
It is not true that Cuba has been shut out of the rest
of the world and must break mto our market, to the
injury of our own farmers, or suffer an industrial
collapse.
THE Cuban junta has emerged into the open
and put its fists to the documents it is circu
lating to persuade the American people to en
rich a few score planters by free sugar to
bacco. The members of the junta are Francisco
Gamba, president; Miguel Mendoza, Gustavo Bock,
Simon Dumois, Dionisio Velasco, Luis V. Francke,
Alfonzo Pesant and Juan Pedro, delegates. These
gentlemen have issued a pretentious pamphlet de
claring that: "The Cubans base their petition to
Congress (for free trade) upon two propositions.
First, the United States is under moral obligations
to aid Cuba in the re-establishment of /prosperity 'in
the island. Second, the commerce and industry of
Cuba are in imminent danger of disaster if aid is not
given immediately." Â« " ,

'Â¦'. Where such' methods prevail there can be.no safety
for commerce. The alarm, felt at the first announce
ment of what might follow the" sale of the Gdvern
mentitransports should therefore serve as a warning
for, the future." It is time for our progressive and far
seeing men to. bestir themselves in providing means
for bringing to this port the bulk of the vast trade
that is to grow up between the United States and the
Orient. .;, Â¦ ' i\ \ , - = .
In response to the desire of the public The Call
obtained all .information that could be learned
either here or at the national capital, and yesterday
was enabled to . publish an interview with Secretary
Root which puts an end to any fear of immediate in
jury. In reply to questions by the special cor
respondent of The Call the Secretary said: "I have
asked \ Congress for authority to give up the trans
ports and to make a contract with a private com
pany or companies for doing the business, but' T
hardly think the ' change .will' take place immediately.
When the Government comes , to make'this contract
we shall be very cold-biooded about it, and we shall
make a, contract to the Government's advantage. I
cannot see how any company operating or proposing
to operate from. Seattle can possibly' make a propo
sition to us that would, even, partly offset the aban
donment'of the. Government's -plant at the. Presidio
in San Francisco. It is, safe enough to go upon, the ;
proposition that the Government will always. ship
its men from San Francisco; and as a natural course
of events most of the Government freight will follow
the route over which the men gp."
Â¦ The statement of the ' Secretary is reassuring' so
far as the present emergency is .concerned, but it
will not do for San Francisco- to accept too confi
dently the saying that "it is safe to go upon the prop- #
osition that the Government will always ship its men'
from San Francisco and that the^ freight will follow
the route over which the men go."- In the world of
trade nothing is safe unless men interested in it ex
ert themselves to keep it so. Those who rely upon
circumstances to" bring thenT good fortune or to pre
serve what they have generally wake up some morn
ing to perceive that circumstances have become ad
verse and fortune is gone. San Francisco is the
metropolis of 'the Pacific Coast and is likely- to re
main so, but her' merchants and capitalists must work
to hold for her the prestige of that position:
'Back of-the Puget Sound ports there is anactive,
progressive man ever planning and workingto at
tract to them trade and commerce for his railway
lines. The Southern Pacific Company and the Pa
cific Mail Company have not, been working in that
way for San Francisco. On the" contrary, there have
bepi many instances when they worked directly
against the welfare of the city. A'case of the kind
was brought. to light not long ago when it was found
that steamer rates from this; city : to oriental -points
gave Eastern shippers large advantages over San
Francisco shippers, and, â¢ furthermore, that/the Pa
cific Mail Company was loading its vessels ) with
wares shipped'directly / from the .East, while goods of
fered by our own j shippers lay upon the wharves and
could not 'obtain transportation.
WITH something like the effect Â¦ of , an alarm
bell ; came ..the report from. r Washington .pi \
. the intention of the War Department to dis
pose of the army transport service to the .Philippines
and to rely for transportation hereafter, upon private
lines. San Francisco woke up and began to look at
the situation.. There was an evident desire on the
part of James J. Hill to obtain the Government work
for his lines. at. Seattle, while the Pacific Mail.steam
ship line,'.whichv might. have been expected to^make
the fight for this port, was found to be seemingly in
active. It looked for a time as if we were in serious
danger of losing an important trade, and there was'
in consequence an eager desire to learn from Wash
ington jus^ what might be expected from the pur
posed, change. â¢ . s .
THE BUSINESS OF THE PORT;
4 .-It is : said jthat . thV ball Â¦ at the 'White House â¢ given
for^thedebut-orMiss Roosevelt ;^as the. finest enter-'
' tainmentof ; the"kind i everheld'at the national capi->
tal; .but the i public Â¦Â¦will/ remember to -have heard;
very much j the \ same ' thing said" about \ nearly every
other function at the big mansion. Â¦ .
But the people, who are nearly or remotely the vic
tims of such officialdom, are themselves to blame.
When the way is open to separating politics from the
gutter, and cesspool they refuse to walk therein. Let
the dean and conscientious citizen sit down .and
ask himself why he and all like him combined should
be utterly without influence in the municipal gov
ernment. Let him ask why the patronage of that
government, and largely its official methods, are die-,
tated by a boss, with no visible means of support,
living in defiance of the moral code and the criminal
statutes, dictating, like a lord paramount, the action
of the officers elected by the people, corrupting the
fountain from which issue juries and justice, imper
iling the support of the widow and orphan and play
ing with Justice as if she were a draggled wanton.
Let him ask why there is more Strength. in the little
finger of such a boss where an officer or ah official"
act is concerned than in the loins of all' the decency
of the city, and then reflect if a government under
such control is to be endured any longer-than it '.'can
be purged and /purified. But, let this typical "citizen
remember that he is to blame. There are enough
like him to have it otherwise, but they will not, and
so we have |slumgullion government, chosen in fel
ony and administered in crime.
have not_the impaired and defective satisfaction of
feeling that the high and important trusts 'of the
Clerk's office are in the keeping of that form of
honesty which the great New York manipulator of
men found to be the best he could get hold of. To
criminality this record adds contemptible qualities,
which present a character that has festered in the air
of boss politics until no idea of manhood, fidelity and
duty survives.
private and official life, had been long and varied,
declared that "an honest man is the d â -d scoun
drel who stays bought." But in this case the people
come to be the stench and odium of our politics,' were
not all nor the worst of the symptoms of the Clerk's
character. It was a felony to make the contracts.
Is the office of Clerk safe in hands that commit fel
ony to ! secure.it? ..If so, let us go a step further in~
the psychology of the case. After making . these
promises and being the. beneficiary of them, getting
value received in influence, votes and other valuable
considerations, Clerk Mahony. proceeded , to .violate
and repudiate his felonious contracts and pre-election
promises, illegal in their nature. He had sold him
self for a consideration. He had bartered patronage
paid for by the taxpayers. : He was bought by con
tract, and then refused to stay bought. -
Dean Richmond, whose experience with men in
The Call and its coadjutors offered support and gave
opportunity to a movement in the politics of this city,
and county that would have ' lifted it beyond the
reach of the blear and fetid bosses. The time to do
this was at the primaries, and the way was open; but
the respectable people, good Republicans, taxpaying
citzens who are bled of their means not. to support
local government but to sustain gangs and gangrene
in politics, refused to walk therein and " the " bosses ;'.
were victorious. . \ , ;
Part of the result is now exposed in the condition
of the County Clerk's office. Â¦IThe Clerk is detected'
in making illegal contracts for support as a candidate,
binding himself in writing to use his official patron-'
age to > repay those who gave him active support and
perhaps money^o help him into office, all in defiance
of the law. But these illegal acts, made illegal be-,
cause such promises and contracts entered into had
The people nominate and elect the County, Clerk.
If they choose they can put the office in pure hands
and secure its proper administration, or .by neglect
and inattention, by carelessness and indifference, they,
can permit it to become the personal asset of a gang
of grafters. This latter seems to have happened.
THE CALL has discharged an unpleasant . duty
in exposing. the immoral and faithless condition
of ; the County Clerk's office.; That Office in its
importance ranks, next to the courts. - The: Clerk
draws the juries that try issues of property,; liberty
and life. He takes bonds, is the custodian of wills
and documents in probate, is concerned in judicial
finalities, and immense interests depend upon his in
tegrity and that of his records. Carelessness or cor
ruption in the Clerk's office leave 'their mark for
years. Like a distemper of the blood in man, they
reappear again and again, and their "stigmata " are
upon the property, the rights and the reputation of
generations to come. The property of the people
passes entire through . probate every generation.
How necessary, then, that the record,' and all that
pertains to that passage of jmaterial things from gen
eration to generation in probate, shall be clean, and
made by clean hands P

Second Mate Lupp testified that he or
dered boat No. 2 to go around to the lee
ward and wait for him, and he i gave a
i. e.. at noon of the 120th meridian, or at 8
p. m. Greenwich mean Â¦ time. Â¦ Â¦
W. H. STANDLET.
Captain Hall of the Walla Walla was
recalled and testified that immediately
after the collision the life preservers
were on deck and accessible to the pas
sengers and the crew. He ordered the
boats to be lowered away with the ladies
and passengers first. His orders were to
get everybody into the boats and then,
if the officers, found that the steamship
could be. save'd, they were to return and
place everybody on board again. He did
not think the Max could have come any
nearer to the Walla Walla than she did
after the collision. Captain Hall said
further that they had a fire drill on
board but had no special signal to aban
don ship. When he went on the bridge
after the collision, the second mate told
him .that the Max had no lights. Sec
ond Mate Lupp interrupted the witness
at this point and said that John Hughes,
the third mate, had told him (Lupp) that
all he could see was the. white light on
the Max and he could not. tell where she
was going. .' Â¦ . : . Â¦ Â¦
Captain Hall Testifies Again.
"Probably not all, but a good many,"
was the reply. "I had no more idea that
these boats would go away from the ship
than I have cf dying this moment. Other
wise t would have been in one of the
boats, instead of on a raft. The men in
the boats had their oars out and were
pulling away from the ship. The Max
drifted probably a -mile and a half with
the mainyard backed before she hove to.
The only thing she could do to keep near
the place where the collision occurred
was to heave to. It ,was cloudy over
head, at the time of ' the wreck, but a
light could be plainly seen. There was
no fog or haze on the water." ' >.
A. K. Sheats, (United States Customs
Inspector, testified that he was on board
the Walla Walla the day that she left
this port and saw Captain Hall and the
first officer. They were sober and did
not 1 show the least sign of liquor. The
witness saw the quartermaster and other
officers and they were sober. Two or
three of the deck hands were under the
influence of liquor, but not so much as
not to know how to execute the orders
civen them, i
Inspectors D. A. Silvers, E. Montell
and T. -C. Eagar testified that Just before
the Walla Walla left the wharf all .on
board were sober. .
"There was enough floating equipment
there to pick up all the people in the
water If the. boats had remained around,
the wreck, was there not?" asked Cap
tain Bulger.
The Boats Pulled Away.
The investigation into the matter of the
collision between the Walla Walla and
the French bark Max was concluded yes
terday afternoon by Captains Bolles and
Bulger, United States Inspectors of
Steam Vessels. Captain C. D. Swan, who
was one of the passengers on the W,alla
Walla, was the first witness. He swore
that he looked at his watch immediately
after the collision and saw that the time
was five minutes after 4 o'clock. In fifty
minutes after the collision the Walla
Walla went down. He thought it was
strange that the lifeboats did not remain
near the wreck - to assist in the work of
rescue, as the morning was calm and the
sea smooth, and the boats could easily
have done so. His watch stopped at 5
o'clock, when the ship went down. He
asked Captain Hall whether he could not
run the steamship to the beach, but the
captain replied that the land Was thirty
miles away, and the distance was too
great to make the attempt. â¢
"Don't you think," asked Captain Bul
ger, "that if the boats had stoÂ«d . by the
ship they would have saved more peo
ple?" Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ 'Â¦ Â¦-â¢-* â¢" '' Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦'
"Undoubtedly they would," replied the
witness. .\
Value of Freight Pending.
The Pacific Coast Company, "late owner
of the steamship Walla Walla." and the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company filed a
petition yesterday in the United States
District Court to limit their liability for
the wreck in damage suits pending and
about to be brought to the sum of $1335 28.
the freight pending including passenger
fares. United States Commissioner George
E. Morse was appointed to take testimony
in the matter and will proceed to do so
next Friday at 2 p. m.
The inspectors here announced that the
iir;uiry was closed. They will render a
decision in about two weeks.
Lupp said that Hughes never Heft the
bridge from the time he came on until
after the collision.
similar order to boat No. 4, but he ym%
not sure as to the other boats. "When
the crash came Lupp was on the bridge,
he said, and Hughes told him that all he
could see was the white light.
First Mate Nielsen, the next witness,
swore that he selected Johnson as look'
out because he was a sober man and al
ways attentive to his duties. /

Was No Haze on the Waters on the Fatal Night

We are turning the steam dummy road from
the terminus , of . the Geary and Sacramento
street lines toi Twenty-fourth avenue, near the
Casino, into an electric road. We expect to
have the work done in Â¦ two months, but we
could finish it in one week if it were necessary.
When the new road is built out to the cliff
it will, have a fine track , and - will take the
passengers near the chain of lakes, which no
road does at present. â¢ i Â¦ ., .â¢Â¦.â¢â " -
We ' have a franchise for a road extending
from Twenty-fcurth avenue and Fulton street
out to the ocean beach, and it is valuable
property. We cannot build the road, however,
until the streets are graded. Yes, we have
surveyors going over the route. C
By extending this electric road beyond
the. Casino, passengers will have the ad
vantage of leaving the car about a mile
and a half from the terminus at the
ocean beach and be in proximity to
the beautiful chain of lakes. At present
there is no street car line that runs near
this pretty spot in the park. - *
Superintendent of Construction H. H.
Lynch of the Market-street Railway said
last evening: .
The Market-street Railway Company
officials' eyes have, been opened to the
fact that by changing the old steam
dummy line to the Casino into an elec
tric : road they will greatly increase the
travel upon it, so the necessary steps
were taken and the road will be an elec
tric system in less >than two months.
Surveyors are laying out the line of
the track and the road, when completed,
will furnish. the most direct and shortest
route to the ocean beach and Cliff House.
The Market-street railway system, has
the franchise already and it is an assured
fact that this new line. will toe In opera
tion in less than a. year.
The Market-street railway system Is
soon to have another electric line -to- the
beach and Cliff House. The road, will be
an extension of the one running on Ful
ton street from the terminus of the
Geary. Sacramento and McAllister street
lines" to Twenty-fourth avenue and the
Casino. It Is now a steam dummy line,
but electricity will soon be substituted
as the motive power. '
Proposed Extension Will

FAKE HAIR PREPARATIONS
Do Hair No Good, but Often Causs
It to Fall Out
Many hair preparations are "fake", be-
cause they are merely scalp irritants.
They often cause a dryness, making the
hair brittle and finally lifeless. Dandruff
Is the cause of all trouble with hair: It Is
a germ disease.' The germ makes cuticle
scales as it digs to the root of the hair,
where it destroys the hair's vitality, caus-
ing the hair to fall out. To cure dandruff
the germ must be killed. "Destroy the
cause, you remove the effect." Newbro's
Herpicide is the only hair preparation that
kills the dandruff germ, thereby leaving
the hair to grow luxuriantly.

was quiet, . with ' a . strong undertone. - After
yesterday's demoralization a . firm opening on
cables and dry weather, were very , reassuring
to the bull professionals. " The effect 'of /.the
Phillips . heavy liquidation had evaporated and Â¦
the market was on its old footing . again.: Per
haps the most noticeable . result of yesterday's
tumult was the unusual heavy outside business.
Shortly .after the opening of 'May, which was
%@Â»4c to '/4@9fic higher" at 81i4c to 81%c,
there was an effort made at' supporting >.- the
market, and at -one time on a revival of com
mission , : buying - a recovery seemed ' imminent. '
As it was. May rose to 81 %c. Bears, however,
had the bulls virtually by the horns an,d pressed
prices steadily on.Â» : Heavyi selling set; In on
all sides. News came that Liverpool was, de
clining.; Some shorts took advantage of the
advance to cover for profits,' but the amount of
wheat thus absorbed was trifling. Weak holders
everywhere were forced out .by, the heavy calls
for margins [ by houses ; that ' feared ! other fail
ures might result I f rom : yesterday's . hard pres
sure. To abet the bearish argument, the coarse
grains were being â¢ pounded . also. Cash ; corn
was especially weak. May. wheat : during ", the
last . hour slid : off - rapidly to Â¦ 80c; , and at ; the
close of the session was weak,' %Â®%c lower at

NEW YORK. Jan. 15. â The stock market
turned from its recent consistent downward
course to-day and enjoyed something of a
rally. The demand was on a fairly large
scale, but the market showed a tendency to
fall into intense dullness and developed a
hesitating tone on the advance. There were
a number of reactions during the day,' but the
closing was near to the top level, but dull
ness and wavering still very manifest. The
demand from the short interest was a pal
pable influence in the rise. Evidences of sup
port were seen early In the day in some of the
stocks, which were chief arguments 'for bear
attacks, notably in Union Pacific and other
trar*scor.tinentalÂ». This served to Intimidate
the bears, although they renewed their selling
on advances. The fact was manifest, how
ever, that the more urgent selling had been
dlspdsed of lu previous days, and the efforts
of the bears induced little liquidation. A
number of Incidents aided the bulls In turn
ing the market against their opponents. There
was a striking demonstration in Sugar on tin
strength of the hearing accorded by the Ways
and Means Committee at Washington to the
advocates of a reduction of duties on Cuban
sugars. The increase in the dividend rate
from 2 to a per cent on New York, Chicago
and St. Louis second preferred relieved some
apprehension that there would be no increase,
although the distribution was ' not as large as
some speculators have claimed. New York
Central developed strength early in the day
and had risen to the highest point before the
announcement of the new stock issue and the
subscription rights to stockholders. The price
was inclined to sag after the announcement,
as new bond and capital issues have been in
disfavor with speculators recently. The price
of the ttock has indicated for some time past
that rights of tome sort were accruing, as
the directors' statement now Indicates was,
the fact. The statement of the country's for
eign trade, for December was regarded as
favorable. The heavy decline In exports of
breadstuffs, principally of corn, was expected.
The decline in this item accounts for practi
cally the whole of the decrease In the total
exports for the month, which was about
$8,P00,000. compared with the previous Decem
ber. This shows that the declining tendency
In the exports . of manufactured products has
been arrested, as was first Indicated la<Â«t
month. The increase > in the imports for the
month has resulted in a falling off of the
trade balance in our favor altogether of over
$20,000,000, compared with the - previous De
cember, but' the Increase in imports is not
regarded aa an unfavorable factor at pres
ent, as It is made up in part of crude articles
for use In manufactures and of products for
which domestic manufacturers are not able
to fill all the orders they receive. The large
gain by the banks from the Sub-Treasury and
the retorn of the flow of currency ' from the
interior give assurance of a [ favorable bank
return on Saturday, and the heaviness of sterl
ing exchange indicates that no gold will go out
this week. There was also a subsidence to-day
of recent vague rumors of financial troubles
in the commercial world. The sharp drop in
People's Gas was due to the refusal of a court
to grant an - injunction against the Chicago
city ordinance reducing the rate for gas to
75 cents per thousand. Its Influence on the
general market was only slight. The active
bonds generally moved in sympathy with
stocks. Total sales, par value, $3,225,000.
United States refunding twos declined }g ana
the threes coupon advanced % per cent on the
last cell.
New York Stock Market.
Railroad earnings continue very flattering,
and thi? in spite of a falling off in the grain
movement at the West. General traffic is still
exceedingly heavy, and railroad officials ap
pear confident of its continuance. The coal
trade is in excellent condition, demand being
heavy and prices high. The increase, however,
in Jersey Central dividend "from 5 to 8 per
cent savored more of stock speculation In be
half of Reading than good railroad manage
ment. Such strength as the market has lately
fhoxrn was entirely due to powerful manipula
tion aided by easy money. Rising bank re-
FFi-ves are to be expected for some time to
come and as the big leaders are all necessarily
r-nlisted on the lone side, having stocks in
abundance to sell. It is quite probable that in
the absence of unfavorable news we may ex
pect a continued manipulated, active market.
The greater the advance from present prices,
however, the greater the feverishness and sen-
Fitfveness to unfavorable news. There are
not a few operators who are now opÂ»nly favor
ing a higher market in order to secure a safer
ba?is= for selling later on. In any event the
market will rÂ«fluire close watching, and I can
only repeat our former advice of selling long
Ftnoks on all the pronounced advances here
after.
New competition is now growing with suffi
cient rapidity to be a factor in the Industrial
chares. New plants and enlargements are be
ing constantly started and others projected.
At present the demand for commodities seems
sufficiently active to keep all establishments
fully employed; but price concessions are be
ing made, and coming reports are likely to
make less favorable balance sheets than last
year The statement of the United States
Stetl Corporation, though a good one, was not
to satisfactory as expected.
The two most likely starting points of re
action will be contraction by the banks, and
tue influence of new competition. Of the for
mer mere is no indication as yet. except that
banks arc becoming more cautious lenders
einee the recent practical failures of two or
tmee large industrial enterprises. Fortunate
ly the monetary outlook is satisfactory, and
nothing Â¦rtll 00 more toward keeping us in a
sound and prosperous condition than wise re
straint en the part of the banks in granting
credit. The country is still in need of a ecI
entine and elastic curreacy system, the ab
t-ence of which vastly increases the danger of
panic in times of retrenchment and disaster.
Â£>ut Congress sleeps, forgetful that the promise
of two national elections to provide a sound
currency syÂ«em are still t unfulfilled. What
if the country should fail to give the party
in power a third chance to redeem ante-elec
tion pledges?
Conflicting influences have kept the stock
market fairly active and irregular, affording
excellent opportunities to the professional
trader. Opinion is not so optimistically one
sided as a year ago. The facts that prices are
very high, and that the maintenance of pres
ent inflation is only possible through unexpect
ed continuance of prosperity, are becoming
pcr.rrally recognized and inducing a growing
epirit of conservatism. When Stock Exchange
transactions have risen from 54,000,000 shares
in 1696 to 253.000.000 in 1901 it seems time to
call a halt for reflection. . During that same
period many of the active stocks have more
than doubled in value; bank loans in New York
have risen from $467,000,000 to $S75.000,000;
plgiron production has doubled; our exports
have risen over 40 per cent and imports^ nearly
30 per cent; while prices of staple commodities
average one-third higher than in 1901. Such
extraordinary prosperity is- of course highly
self-satisfying; but its altogether exceptional
character throws the strongest doubt upon its
high level permanence. Not a few men whose
judgment is entitled to respect believe that the
present rush of business and traffic will con
tinue another year. Nobody wishes to disa
gree v.ith them and every one will hope their
views may prove correct; yet facts cannot be
ignored, and these point unmistakably toward
reaction, notwithstanding there are quarters
in which the onward movement may continue
or break out afresh in spots hitherto neglected.
There is for instance strong, evidence of a boom
in real estate, which is invariably sought for
investment when other fields have lost their
Attractions, but such operations have always
marked the culmination of an American
"boom."

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL
year ago. receipts were 48,000 bush
els.^-compared' with' 620.000 bushels, s Seaboard
clearances in wheat ' and flour equaled 162.000
bushels: The seaboard reported 48 .cars taken
for^expQrt. â¢ - ; ,- -. : '... - .--'â¢- ',-. -
'Â¦Â¦ Corn started firm and higher with" wheat, and
on fairly good cables. Some of the corn sold
yesterSay was replaced I and there Â¦ was some
small i country buying. Â¦'â¢ Receipts were very
light.', but country offerings . were reported freer.
When wheat advanced corn followed after, but
soon . turned heavy - on its own poor cash situ
' atlon, and later broke â¢ badly in â¢ wheat com
pany.' Cash houses reported a poor demand..
Good weather curtailed the amount needed for
stock raising, and the absence . of demand
worked against the pit. Liquidation on all
sides set - in about the noon hour and prices
slumped in a. panicky fashion. May, which
had opened steady at 65% Â©05^0 and sold up
to 65%c. dropped almost 2 cents to 03%c. At
this figure shorts took profits enough to stead>
the market at" the close. * The session ended
with May â¢ weak. l%c down at 63%c. Receipts
were 83 cars.
Farly in the day oats ruled rather firm and
independent of the other pits.
I Provisions - were fairly active. I They started
out with good evidence of a bull market on a
country demand and a strong hog market, at
the yards. "When corn collapsed, however, the
early , bought Btuff was thrown overboard and
prices slid off." May pork closed 10c down' at
$17 0"!/4; May lard, 7V'c lower at $9 70 and
May ribs.- 7&c lower at $8 60@8 021,4

After the adjournment of the Senate
Hale said the naval reserve bills ' intro

by request of persons interested in such

introduced bills representing both the
Navy Department's views and those of in
dividuals or organizations on the ques
tion of a naval reserve. : He personally,
however, did not stand committed to any
of them ; and he questioned whether any
satisfactory results would come from
them. ' >
Half a dozen Senators were on their feet

the rational guards of the various States.
The debate took so wide a range that
Senators went back' In their reference to
the days of the Revolutionary War to
seek illustrations for their arguments.

it is likely that the discussion upon the
measures, should they be reported, will

Politicians â¢who claim to foe posted con
cerning the adjutant generalship assert
that the commission has been issued and
that the name of George Stone is inscribed
thereon. Colonel Stone, a day or two
agro. conveyed the impression that he
would accept the office. There was talk
last night that his friends were urging
him to decline the commission, using as
argument that acceptance would remove
his name from the list .of possible candi
dates for Republican nomination for Gov
ernor. Colonel Stone is chairman of ttie
Republican State Central Committee and
a member of the Republican Primary
League. In tendering the adjutant gen
eralship to the colonel the Governor may
have had It In mind to gratify the league
and at the same time clear the field of fu
ture contest by the elimination of a rival.
It is understood that Colonel Stone is an
ardent advocate of Samuel M. Shortridge
for United States Senator to succeed
George C. Perkins.
The recent reappointment of Isaac Up
ham of this city and O. A. Hale of San
Jose to the Board of Trustees, Agnews
Asylum, has no political significance.
They have rendered the State excellent
service. for many years, and are men of
high character and good business attain

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
,W.; WASHINGTON, 1 Jan. 13.â Diplomacy
has interfered in the fight in progress to
permanently â¢ exclude Chinese from the
United States. To the. dismay of Pacific
Coast interests Â¦which' have been' vigor
ously pushing a bill contemplating ex
clusion without limit of . time Secretary
Hay has come forward with a proposition
that the legislation enacted contains a
provision for its Â¦ termination within two
years and six months from next May.
If this suggestion be adopted the exclusion
law will fall simultaneous with the term
ination of the treaty regulating Chinese
immigration. . J
'In ample time before the expiration of
the treaty Secretary Hay will begin nego
tiations with, Wu Ting Fang, the Chinese
Minister, as a result of which a new con
vention in relation to Chinese immigra
tion will be signed and laid before Â¦ the
Senate for .ratification. Such procedure
would be unsatisfactory to Pacific Coast
interests, which urge that'll the. treaty
and law. should expire at the same time
and a new tieaty\which might be nego
tiated should fail of ratification the door
would be left wide open for the admission
of Chinese and a mad rush would occur
which would be highly Injurious to Amer
ican labor. â¢;."Â¦'-;
The State Department is Inclined to
think that these fears are exaggerated
and that before the law or treaty term
inated an arrangement could be arrived at
which would be satisfactory, to China and
the United States. Wu Ting Fang ha3
cleverly intimated that if Congress adopts
harsher measures -than those already in
force his Government will retaliate. Â¦
"â¢ The sub-committee of Pacific Coast Sen
ators and Representatives Interested In
Chinese exclusion, with Representative
Newlands of Nevada as chairman, con
cluded their work to-day and will report
to-morrow to the full' committee*, repre
senting all the Pacific Coast .States. . The
majority report .will present a. bill com
bining the best features of the several
measures which have been proposed, in
cluding that of the Immigration bureau
introduced by Representative Kahn and
the Federation of Labor bill. It is also
expected that there will be a minority
report favoring a more simple treatment
of the question by extending, the Geary

NEW YORK, Jan. 15.â The Chamber of
Commerce and Merchants' Association of
New York have adopted resolutions favor-
Ing the passage of an exclusion bill which
Â«hall expire or. the' same day the treaty
terminates. Pacific Coast steamship In
terests and. transcontinental railroads are
at work opposing the enactment of any
bill contemplating Chinese exclusion.
There are now pending: before this com
mittee seven bills providing for .a cable
in the Pacific Ocean to be built by .the
Government or to be heavily subsidized
by the Government.
Senator Hale, chairman of the Senate
committee, made this statement to-day:
"Members of the Senate Committee on
Xaval Affairs are not disposed to do any
thing further in the matter of bills be
fore them providing for a Government
cable to the Far East. Last year the
committee reported and the Senate passed
a bill for such a cable, but no action was
taken by the House. No further consid
eration will be taken here unless the
Houfc should pass a bill. The commit
tee was very much impressed with the
Etatements made in behalf of the Com
mercial Cable Company. Their operations
are already well advanced and they show
a disposition" to comply with all the Gov
ernment requirements. They stand ready
to sell to the Government at its own ap
praisal and are willing to leave to. the
Postmaster General the matter of rates.
The company is acting in good faith and
asks no Government subsidy. I don't
think the committee will take any further
action in any matter which looks to direct
competition on the part of the United
States."

HALE'S REMARKS
STIR A STORM
Back to the jail went Holland to Inves
tigate. By some means or another the
empty cell that had been occupied by tho
trio that got out Monday night had been
entered, the door lock having been picked.
It was an easy enough matter to break
jail then, for repairs had not been com-
Hempstead quickly realized what had
occurred, for yesterday morning's escape
was still a fresh topic of conversation at
the courthouse. The janitor ran after the
men, who turned into Fifth street, the
pursuer's yells attracting Holland, who
joined in the chase, but the fleeing men
quickly distanced the officer and they
disappeared.
Deputy Sheriffs Will; Holland and George
Wales were on duty at the jail, when
Holland was suddenly aroused by a cry
of prisoners escaping. The warning came
from Bert Hempstead, Janitor at the Hall
of Records on Broadway, between Fourth
and Fifth streets. He had finished work
and was walking along Fourth street
toward Washington when he saw tho
figures of two men lowering themselves
down the jail wall that faces the Court
house yard. The men were scarcely on
the ground before they ran out to the
Fifth-street entrance of tho Courthouse
yard. . ,
. John McGinnis and F. J. Loring, ac
cused of burglary, climbed through the
opening that Frank Caldwell, Fred Smith
and James Murphy escaped through yes
terday morning. This third escape in
three weeks was successfully accom
plished at five minutes to 6 o'clock this
evening.
OAKLAND, Jan. 15.â Complete de
moralization has overtaken Sheriff
Rogers and his force of deputies.
As if to add. to the general dis
order, two more prisoners escaped
to-night from the County Jail, following
their cellmates of yesterday through the
same aperture they made to gain free
dom.
â¢ Make Rope of Overall Strips.'
Loring and McGinniss after opening this
cell door, climbed through, lowered them
selves to the jail yard, and were over
the wall. They had ripped several pairs
of overalls, into, strips,,. woven 'them.. to?
gether.irope-fashion.rfastehed'a wire hook
at one end, and with that made their way
over the wall. The rope of overalls was
found dangling where Hempstead had
seen the two prisoners get away. The re
cord now stands:
Escaped Christmas- night, December. 23 â
Frank Case, robbery; William Kelly, burglar}'.
Kscaped Monday, night, January. 13 â frank
Caldwell. burtslary; Fred. Smith, burglary:
James Murphy, burglary. . ' .
: Escaped January 15-^-John McGinnis. burg

McGinnis was a partner of Kelly, who
escaped Christmas night. They had been
arrested for alleged burglaries at the
race track. He is 24 years old. Loring
was arrested at Nlles for robbing saloons
at Pleasanton. He is 25 years old.
Sheriff Rogers is now congratulating
himself: that the Grand Jury corridor oc
cupants did not follow McGinnis and Lor
ing. There were thirteen prisoners in the
corridor, Just before the two men de
parted, and so far as the jailers know,
there was no reason why the entire num
ber should not have gone.- .. â¢ Â¦Â¦ Â¦
The escape was made just before the 6
o'clock lockup.
'Deputy Sheriff Wales declares that the
cell door through which the men went
to-night has been locked ever since: the
â¢ delivery, of Monday night was discovered.
He" said: "They must have picked the
lock and then gone through the hole -in

I was charged by J. N. Hitchcock with the
crime of feloniously obtaining money by false
pretenses in Tulare County on April 13, 1001.
The case was tried before Justice of the Peace
H. C. Ullie. and, on the showing of the pros
ecution, was dismissed on December 30 1901
The circumstances were that I secured a
claim in the Koyokuk country a year ago last
summer, under power, of attorney from Hitch
cock; when I returned that fall I reported to
him. and he paid me for the location last
spring. He sold out a part of the claim to
Visalia parties and they sent , a young man
Â¦with him to Alaska, all going on the same
steamer with me and my son.
In the course of time we reached the claim
and he was put into possession of it never
making- any complaint, nor intimating that he
had any claim against me. â¢ He expressed sat
isfaction with the claim. The matter then was
apparently settled to everybody's satisfaction.

Senator Perkins has been confined to
his room for a day or two with a pain
ful attack of rheumatism, but his condi
tion Is to-night somewhat improved and
he hopes to be in his seat in the Senate
to-morrow.
At the afternoon session Atkins contin
ued his statement, in the course of which
te expressed strong opposition to any sys
tem of drawback. He said that the Have
meyer interests were email and exercised
no controlling influence. Atkins said that
If political conditions continued Cuba
would probably become so desperate as
to be forced into action.
Lewis Place, a merchant of Havana and
head of the Cuban delegation, presented
the case from the Cuban standpoint. At
present, he said. Cuba was buying large
quantities of foreign goods, and if recip
rocity was brought about with the United
States Cuba would buy American com
mon goods, wine and many other articles
now bought abroad. He believed this
market In Cuba would amount to $250,000,
000 within two years.
Francis B. Thurber of the United States
Export Association said that the primary
consideration was one of good faith on
the part of the- United States toward
Cuba.
Hugh Kelly of New York, who has
large sugar holdings In Cuba, said that
se an American he urg-ed that reciprocal
concessions be made. He believed that if
there was no reciprocity Cuba would ask
tor annexation. If this occurred the voice
â¢f the American people would be for ad
jiittins 1 the island. Â¦
Mendoza. of the Cuban delegation pic
tured the distress if present conditions

tugar crop this year would approximate
{12.000.000. He Ftrongly favored the free

The hearing will continue to-morrow.
Views of the Merchants.
Aside from the advantage of reciprocity
to Cuba, Atkins maintained that it would
be of material advantage to the United
States, including a reduction in the price
Df sugar to the people.
Asked by Payne if the sugar business
nas profitable last year, Atkins said ha
conceded that It had been, but general
inquiry among planters showed that they
had not done a profitable business.
Sugar in the Island.
Atkins stated that there was now about
$20,000,000 worth of standing cane in Cuba
and at present prices a considerable part
of this would not be harvested. While
not an alarmist, he said the effect Â¦would
be serious loss to the planters and the
labor employed. The loss to labor, he
thought, was likely to lead to disturb
ances. At the time set for the withdrawal
of American troops there would be, in his
opinion, a deficit in the insular revenues,
which- were largely recruited from t,he
sugar industry.
AtkSrs stated that a 50 per cent reduc
tion of duties was desired on the vari
ous products of the island, but in response
to inquiries from Payne he said that tne
sugar industry felt it should have 100
per cent reduction. Atkins stated that the
opposition to Cuban reciprocity came from
special sources, namely, the domestic beet
sugar industry, the Hawaiian planters
and the sugar interests of Porto Rico and
Louisiana, aggregating 890,009 tons pro
duction. To Payne he stated that a very
large percentage of the Cuban sugar in
dustry was owned by citizens of the
United States.
Chairman Payne stated at the outset
that the hearing was in reference to that
portion of the President's message re
lating to reciprocity with Cuba. The com
mittee would first hear those favorable to
Cuba, and Payne stated that the com r
mittee desired to be informed as to the
effect of reciprocity, both on Cuba and on
the people of the United States.
Edwin F. Atkins of Boston made the
opening statement in behalf of reciprocity.
He spoke of the enormous overproduction
of sugar throughout the world, amounting
to about 1.500.000 tons, which had resulted
in a crisis in the industry. European
countries had met this by bounties so
that the German producer, by means of
a bounty, was able to sell sugar at half
a cent per pound below its cost of produc
tion. The cost of production in Cuba was
2.6 cents per pound, which was somewhat
above the selling price.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15.â The Ways and
Means Committee began hearings to-day
on the subject of Cuban reciprocity with
a large representation present from the
various interests which would be affected
by legislation of this character.
The Cuban industries were represented
by Place. Mendoza, Dumois and Francke.
chosen by commercial organizations in va
rious parts of the island. The American
interests engaged in sugar production In
Cuba were represented by Edwin F. At
kins, spokesman for an organization con
trolling a large part of the sugar produc
tion of the island, Hugh Kelly of New
York and John F. Craig of Philadelphia.
"Willliam Haywood was present in behalf
of the Hawaiian sugar planters and Henry
T. Oxnard for the domestic beet sugar
interests. The tobacco and other interests
affected by Cuban production also were
well represented.
Ways and Cleans Committee of the
House Begins the Hearing of
the Tariff and Trade
Goodmanson was tried in Pender, Neb.,
and acquitted on a charge of murdering
his beautiful first wife, who was Miss
Laura Ioder, a leader in church work at
Tiskilwa, 111. Her parents were wealthy
and she brought her husband considerable
property. They moved to Pender, where
Goodmanson praticed dentistry. He dlÂ«l
a thriving business and they soon built
a fine home, into which they had not yet
moved,- when Mrs. Goodmanson died sud
denly. According to the published re
ports in Illinois papers, she expired after
visiting the office of her husband, where
she complained of being ill andywas given
something to drink.
About a week after the funeral sus
picions were aroused and it was decided
to exhume the body and send the stomach
to , Chicago for analysis. Chemists there
found that the stomach contained poison
in" sufficient quantity to cause death.
.-. Dr. Goodmanson was arrested, tried and
acquitted. Soon afterward he moved to
this State', and engaged in practice In &
small .country, town in one of the back-
Woods counties. Nothing was heard of
him until letters arrived at Pender and
Tiskilwa <Â¦ giving information about- Â¦ his
supposed lynching. The story -was that
his second wife had died -suddenly, under
circumstances similar to the death of tlÂ»e
first Mrs. Goodmanson; that the manner
of his first wife's death was known in the
community, and when the second wife
died the neighbors, promptly, concluded he
was guilty and. made short work of him.
TACOMA, Jan. 15.â The whereabouts of
Dr. Sidney Goodmanson, dentist, and
whether he is dead or alive are questions
which residents of this State, Illinois, Ne
braska and South Dakota are endeavor
ing to solve. Newspapers in Pender,
Neb., and Princeton, 111., recently pub
lished extended reports to the effect that
Goodmanson had been lynched in this
State for the murder of his second wife.
These publications were based on letters
received from Washington, which gave
some details of the reported lynching, but
failed to say just where or when the
event took place. So far as is known, n<;
such lynching has occurred in Washing
ton, t and it could not have taken place
without gaining publicity, except in ,the
backwoods of Okanogan or Douglas Coun
ties. There is reason to believe that the
'report was sent to Nebraska, and Illinois
by Goodmanson himself, or by some
friend, with the purpose of covering his
future movements. ;

BAKERSFIELD. Jan. 15.â Oil circles
are stirred to-night by a report, of which
there is no denial, that the Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company <ias purchased
from the Thirty-Three and Imperial Oil
companies section 33, in the Kern River
fields, for a sum said to be between $3,000,
000 and $7,000,000. The price i3 conserva
tively, estimated to have been the former
ngure. or an amount considerably below
the latter.
On the property in question there are
about thirty producing wells, with a grosa
daily output of .40U0 barrels. The pur
chase includes all improvements in the
form of pipe lines, pumping plants and
tankage, wnich in value will, it is said,
foot up $250,000. The land is in the best
portion of the Kern River fields. The
wells sunk upon the section have proved
to be uniformly successful as producers.
The value, of the land has been rougniy
estimated at $4,000,000. The selling com
panies had a good bargain, however, with
the Southern Pacific, which probably led
to the railroad company making me puÂ»
chase. . Â¦ â¢
At an early date and before there was
any Idea that the wells would be such
producers or that such a body of petro
leum would be struck, the Southern Pa
cific had agreed to handle all the oil pro
duced on the property, for which it was
to pay $1 a barrel. As the Southern Pa
cific could not possibly consume the out
put, it said that it had chosen to pur
chase at a high figure rather than buy
at $1 a barrel and sell at one-third of that
price. ' '
Special DisWUch to The CalL '
Rev. Mr. Cone stand high in this com
munity and his friends declare that of
all those who have had dealings jvith him
in the mining- claims Hitchcock was the
only one to complain.
After Cone was discharged in Visalia
Hitchcock tried to get a. warrant for his
arrest in Hanford on the same charge,
but the Justices refused to issue one.
HANFORD, Jan. 15.â Former parishion
ers of Rev. C. P. Cone in this city are loth
to believe the charges that be obtained
money under false pretenses in connection
with Nome mining claims. While there
has been much complaint among the
many who contributed to the clergyman's
"grubstake" when tne gold fever : seized
him, his friends here point to the fact
that no evidence was found against him
when a Visalia court passed upon his cul
pability. They declare that each person
who advanced a few dollars to pay the
expenses of the reverend gentleman's trip
to Alaska expected to receive in return a
claim that would enrich him for life and
that the investors are indignant because
their hopes have not been realized. -
Rev. Mr. Cone, who was formerly pas
tor of the Christian cnurch in this city,
was arrested in Alameda on December 27
and taken to Visalia on a charge of secur
ing money under false . pretenses. The
warrant was sworn to by J. N. Hitchcock
of Visalia. Hitchcock claimed that he
had paid Cone money for work done on
mining claims at Kotzebue Sound that
was never performed. At the preliminary
examination of Cone, which took place in
Visalia, he was discharged, as there was
not enough evidence to hold him. Cone
claimed that he did all the required work
on the claims; that he had worked out
the assessments and had located some
good properties. The $100 that he received
from Hitchcock, he said, was the pro rata
Hitchcock agreed to put up before he
(.Cone) went to Kotzebue. '

SACRAMENTO. Jan. 15.â The , various
literary and musical clubs of this city
united in a reception in the Senate Cham
ber of the State Capitol yesterday to
Miss Virna AVooda, author of "Horatius."
and Frederick Warde, the tragedian, who
produced the play in Clunie Theater Mon
day night, for the first time in California.
The event was one of the most note
worthy social gatherings of the season,
there being present several hundred fash
ionably attired women. Miss Woods wft3
complimented upon the excellence of the
play, and Mr. Warde upon the finished
character of the performance.
On behalf of the various local organ
izations Mrs. H. Weinstock delivered an
appropriate address, followed by a ta\r
words in acknowledgment by Mis*
Woods, introductory remarks by Mrs. E.
P. Colgan and a brief discourse by Mr.
Warde upon "Literature and the Drama."
Mr. Warde pointed out the educational
value of the drama, and said that the
leading: characters of -ancient England
were beat remembered through the
dramas of Shakespeare, rather than the
writings of the historians. He said ths
adage that "a prophet is not without
honor, save in his own country." was re
versed in the case of Miss Woods, who
was showered by her fellow townspeople
with compliments upon the success of ier
dramatic efforts.

Senator Foraker spoke feelingly of the
late President McKinley and concluded
his address with thanks for the honor be
stowed on him.
But, great as have been these economical
achievements, others there are and greater.
Unexpected emergencies have arisen and un
foreseen responsibilities have been devolved
upoi us. Grave questions of vital character
relating to our power to acquire, hold and
govern territory to the necessities of the peo
ple governed have been settled for all time.
The interoceanic canal, our merchant marine,
our navy, the government of our Insular pos
sessions, our relations with Cuba and especially
our trade relations with other commercial
countries will demand and must receive the
highest and best thought of the legislative
mind.
The great industrial problem of Europe at
this time Is not how to sell In our markets,
but how to protect their own from our commer
cial Invasion, and one of our greatest problems
is how to go on Indefinitely controlling the
stupendous balance of trade In our favor with
out bankrupting the rest of the -world and thns
destroying the customers we are acquiring. The
floods of gold that are pouring in upon us are
rapidly racking us the great creditor nation of
the earth, so that henceforth we shall hold
the securities of other peoples and collect in
terest from them on their obligations instead
of, as heretofore, paying them tribute on ours.
If nothing more than this 'had been accom
plished it would be enough to entitle ail who
participated in the good work to the gratitude
and plaudits of American people.
I cannot sufficiently thank the Republicans
of Ohio for such long-continued, exceptional
and unprecedented marks of their confidence
and good-will. I can assure them, however,
that I shall earnestly strive to meet such un
common honor. Since I stood here, six yeara
ago, on a similar occasion a good deal of Im
portant history has been made. At that timÂ«
the country was suffering from universal busi
ness paralysis and prostration. There was a
serious controversy going on as to the cause
and . the remedy. All agreed that prosperity
should be restored, but there were wide differ
ences as to methods. All then recognized that
the first great work of the immediate future
had relation to our economic conditions. Time
has passed. The record has been made. It 13
before you. It speaks for Itself. My partici
pation may have been small, but whether mucli
or little it went to swell the grand aggregate
of effort by which the greatest Industrial won
ders of all time have been wrought. Long
vanished prosperity has returned and never in
the . history of the world has there been auy
thtnsr like what we now enjoy.
I have my fair share of enemies and de
tractors, as every other public man has had
since the beginning of the Government and
will have until the end of time. It ia not
pleasant to have enemies, but it Is a great
satlsfactlefn to be able to set down over
and against all they have said or may say the
answering fact that of all the many honors It
has h.e2n my good fortune to enjoy at tha
hands of the Republicans of Ohio, every one,
without a singla exception, has come to me
with this same unanimity at expression and
most of them by acclamation and without so
licitation.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 15.â The Senate
and House met in joint session to-day and
re-elected Joseph B. Foraker to the United
States Senate. Senator Foraker had prac
tically no opposition, the division being
purely partisan, the Democrats supporting
Charles H. Baker of Cincinnati. Every
Republican cast his vote for Senator
Foraker. The election "was purely a for
mal one. There were no addresses except
that of the Senator. He said In part:

Petition for His Removal as Assignee
of Pleasant Estate Is Given a
Hearing'.
The petition for the removal of George
R. Eaton as assignee of the estate of
"Mammy" Pleasant was given a hearing
in Judge Troutt's court yesterday. The
petition was filed by the creditors of the
old colored woman, who accuse Eaton of
being derelict in his duties. They also
claim that Mrs. Pleasant's estate is of a
greater value than reported, and ask for
the appointment of a receiver who will so
manage the property that they can secure
the payment of their claims.
Eaton was ordered some days ago to file
an account of his stewardship. He did so,
and the attorneys for the creditors Imme
diately filed objections to some of the
"items. A claim of 515.000 against the es
tate, which grew out of a note for $5000
executed in 1895 by Mrs. Teresa Bell and
Mrs. Pleasant, is the principal Item, it
Is claimed that the note, which is now
held by Eaton, was altered after It passed
" n Â£? Â«!" s ix>ssession. m that the clause
which provides that the note should draw
.merest at the rate of 3 per cent monthly
and compounded monthly was added.

The Mayor was furnished with an ex
planation yesterday by the Board of
Works as to why the construction of a
new lire alarm station in i the courtyard
of the City Hall has not yet been com
menced. The sum of $7500 was appro
priated in the tax budget last June, but
the board informed the Mayor that the
sum is insufficient. ; as the, building re*
quired by the Fire Department would cost
$15 <X)0. Mayor Schmitz was satisfied with
the explanation, but ; to-day he will ac

Mayor Schmitz set for himself a her

.stated that his predecessor had not com
plied with the charter provision which
requires that every bill involving an ex
penditure of over $200 must be sent to
the Mayor for his approval. Schmitz is
of the opinion that the word "bill" refers
to warrants or demands, though it has
been understood to be a generic term for
resolutions or ordinances. Mayor Schmitz,
however, depisted in the work of sign
ing several hundred demands and decided
to consult his attorney before proceeding

were :: wasted. She sank â¢; back into Â¦?:'Â¦ her
chair, rested her arms on the table and
hid her face in them.' -Her sobs could be
heard throughout ' the - entire ; courtroom,
and so fierce was her agony that it seemed
as if her slight frame would be shaken
to pieces. ' ' : ' , ',
Â¦ ChÂ«yney felt his ' position :: keenly and
was decidedly uncomfortable . until .the
hysterical woman was led from. the court
room. He then ; went- on- with his âtesti
mony. He said he never deceived Miss
Nevill, asserting that'he. never made -her
any promises ' of â¢ marriage or :Â¦ ever held
out to her any hope that? she could ever,
become his wife. ,
Miss Nevill's outburst of yesterday was
a complete surprise to . those who have
watched and admired the.' demeanor of the
little -woman- since the commencement of
the suit.
Cheyney, her alleged husband, was on
the witness stand. He was telling of his
first meeting with Miss Nevill, and as he
proceeded with his tale she became excit
ed. He i denied every cnarge ; she ' made
against him, and denounced her testimony
given in' her own behalf as false.
As- he proceeded Miss 'Nevill's mother,
an elderly woman;, uponwhose face lines
of 4 care - and : worry . were traced; com
menced to: weep. The sight of her suf
fering excited, the plaintiff, and she
sobbed, out hysterically: "1 will kill that
man!" Â¦' ' - - . Â¦ ? :-. â¢. . â¢.Â¦;Â¦'
The little woman, who for weeks -has
been - compelled to sit quietly in a ; blg
courtroom and listen to the. story of her
life with Samuel W. Cheyney, the man
whose wife she claims to be, but who re
pudiates her, has certainly had a, nerve
racking experience, but up to; yesterday
she -gave' no sign of the burden, of grief
she was bearing. .
