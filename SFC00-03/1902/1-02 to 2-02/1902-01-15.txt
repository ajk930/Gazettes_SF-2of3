COUNTY CLERK MAHONY MUST ANSWER
TO THE LAW FOR HIS GRAVE OFFENSE
BROOKS MAKES DEPOSIT
COVERING DISPTJTED 'FE^S
THE expose by The Call yester
day of the illegal acts commit
ted by County Clerk Bert Ma
hony during the recent cam
paign to secure election was the
sole topic of discussion in polit
ics! circles and in the City Hall.
Mayor Schmitz yesterday morning took
official action on the charges preferred by
The Call, and the Grand Jury will hold a
ppecial session next Friday afternoon for
the purpose of making an investigation.
Intense excitement prevailed in the of
fice of the County Clerk. The dep
uty County Clerks appointed at the be
hest of Boss Crimmins and Attorney Wil
liam F. Herrin#airly shook in their shoes,
fearing that the searchlight of truth
would expose more crooked deals and
throw -them out tr.to the world.
County Clerk Bert ' 'Mahony '. emerged
from the solitude of his home" yesterday '
morning and went to his office in the City
Hall. The doors of his office were locked
and only the favored few of the "push"
were given an audience.
The developments of yesterday were
startling in every way. Mayor Schmitz
had a hard task to secure Mahony's at
tendance in his office, and was obliged to
send his usher and a police officer to
bring him to the Mayor's rooms.
Ex-County Clerk Deane admitted yes
terday the truth of the charges made by
The Call, and told how Mahony had
signed a contract to give him a position
in the County Clerk's office in the event
of Mahony's election.
Mahony tried to evade the question
when asked if he had signed the docu
ment as charged by The Call. He made
a half-hearted denial to a representative
cf The Call, and later on informed the
Mayor that he had not signed any paper
agreeing to give Deane a position.
Mayor Schmitz arrived at his office
early yesterday morning, and as soon as
he had read ihe charges against Mahony
published in The Call he wrote a letter to
the County Clerk and In it asked him to
at once call at the Mayor's office. The
letter was sent to Mahoney's residence by,
mall, as It was given out daily that Ma
hony was ill and was confined to his
room. After sending the letter Mayor
Echrnltz tried to reach Mahony over the
telephone, but was repeatedly informed
by "central" that no one answered the
telephone at Mahony's home.
While the Mayor was trying to secure
telephonic connection with Mahony the
County Clerk was not many yards away
from the Mayor's office, locked behind the
doors of his private office on the second '
floor of the City Hall.
Mayor Schmitz finally got a reply by
telephone from Mahony's home in the
afternoon, and was Informed that the
County Clerk was at the City Hall. When
the Mayor called up the County Clerk's
office he was told that Mahony was out
to lunch and would be back in the course
of a few minutes. The Mayor requested
that Mahony be informed that his pres
ence was desired in the Mayor's office, but
no notice was taken of the message.
Again and again the Mayor telephoned
to the County Clerk's. office, but evasive
answers were given In each case. Then
Mayor Schmitz became angry and deter
mined to get Mahony before him at any
cost. The Mayor instructed his usher,
Marcus Blum, and Police Corporal Wil
liams to go to Mahony's office and to
"Vtand no nonsense."
"Don't be bluffed." said the Mayor to
his usher and police attendant, "but eeÂ«5
Mahfcny and tell him that I want to see
him here immediately or I will know the
reason wjrfj\"
The usher and police corporal did not
iind Mahony in his office when they pro
ceeded there. The County Clerk went out
when the Mayor sent his last telephone
message and met Attorney T. Riordan in
the hallway. The message delivered by
Usher Blum and Corporal XVIHiams, when
they ran into Mahony and his attorney a
few minutes later, had the result desired
by the Mayor.
Mahony. accompanied by his* attorney,
went to the Mayor's office and was im
mediately seen by the city's executive. A
few minutes later Attorney A. Ruef, the
Mayor's legal adviser, arrived and became
one of the party in consultation.
Toe seance lasted but a : few minutes.
V
Deposits Certificate of Deposit With
County Clerk Pending Trial
of Suit.
â¢Former Treasurer 8. H. Brooks yester
day deposited in the custody of the Coun
ty Clerk certificates of deposit on a local
savings bank for JSS17 63, which he had
held as fees for collecting collateral in
heritance taxes, which he retained under
the State law.
The certificates were Immediately
turned over to the city treasury and
locked In the strong vaults. The City At
torney has begun suits on an agreed
statement of facts in Superior Judy*
Cook's court to determine the ownership
of the money.
This job would give him a chance to get
his sleep between the time he closed up
his dive -and the time he. would have to
show up at the City Hall In the mornlngf.
Mahony did not assign - McNalr to the
Justice Court, but told him to report at Â¦
the County Clerk's office every morning at
8:30 o'clock. Now the job does not look
so good to McXair and It la quite possible
that he will resign.
It was persistently rumored on the
street late last night that Martin Kelly,
the political boss, had in his possession
several contracts made by Mahony In
which the latter agreed, in exchange for
Kelly's support, to give him: certain
places in the County Clerk's office. /This
rumor could not be verified,' but It may,
explain the statement made by Steno
grapher John Flood, who says in an In
terview : ; "I drew up so many contract*
during - the campaign that I don't ' know
whlcb one you refer, to."
The Mayor asked Mahony as to the
charges made by The Call, and the Coun
ty Clerk, by the advice of his attorney^
entered a general denial.' . ' :
"That Is 'all for the present," said the
Mayor, and Mahony left the room : .
Mayor Schmitz ordered Mahony to ap
pear before him at the Mayor's office to
day at 2 o'clock Â¦Â¦' to answer â¢ the grave
charges made: - : by- - The ; .Call. < Mahony.-
waived the ; formality of being duly sum
moned, and ' promised to appear, before
the Mayor at the time specified.
Joseph E. Bier, of the : firm of- Bier, &
Regensburger, money' lenders, Â¦ denied
point : blank that he contributed I the , sum
of , J3S50 through Boss .Crimmins v to help
Mahony win his . fight for. the . County,.
Clerkship. Bier also denied'thatrhe had
any, money dealings with Mahony or any- â¢
Douy eise;in tne lauers interests during
the campaign. Bier said: : ;"r have had

sions; during Â¦ his; employment: as {a ; clerk

CITY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND SOME MEN WHO FIGURE 'An' } THE SCANDAL IN THE COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE, i
WILLIAM A. DEANE was
quite fehictant at first to
discuss the details of the
contract. He expressed re
gret that the story had
leaked out and attributed
the expose to overzealous friend3
who were displeased because he
had not been fairly dealt with by Ma
hony. Deane said: "I am extremely sor
ry, that this thins has been made public.
I am sorry for Mahony's sake, even
though ha broke faith with me. Person
ally I feel that my position in the matter
is an unfortunate one. I cannot deny the
truth of the story published In yesterday's
Cair in reference to Mahony having made
a contract with me, and at the same time
|l have little desire to discuss? the matter."
"You know, Mr. Deane. 'that Mr, Ma
hony made a contract to retain you in
his office as chief deputy in the event of
his election?" was asked.
"Yes," answered Deane, "I admit that
he did. I guess there is no use trying to
protect Mahony. AH those who knew of
the contract and saw it" or witnessed it
with their signatures have . admitted its
existence and I will also be truthful about
the matter. 1 was not treated right by
Mahony. I worked harder for his elec
tion than any other man he had in his
fight and of course I am very much
grieved over the way he has turned me
down. â¢ Personally I was disposed to re
turn good for evil and assist him to get
along to the best of my ability, but my
friends have come to, me in large num
bers and all of them are nettled and sore.
I .was certalntly turned down hard.
"I have not spoken of Mahony's con-'
tract to a soul and was thunderstruck
when my wife awakened me at 6 o'clock
yesterday morning to read the story of
the affair published in The Call. I know
where the contract is at the present mo
ment and I can produce It if I am forced
to by the proper authorities. Until I am
ordered to produce this contract by the
proper authorities I will not say where it
is or who has It. It is a sorry plight to
be placed in, but it is no fault of mine
that the secret was divulged. Under the
circumstances it would be useless for me
to- deny the existence of the contract., I
would not be doing justice to my man
hood to He about It. I carried out my end
of it ltke a major, and if Mahony had
not thrown me down the subject would
never have been brought up."

! A. E. Hess, or Hespeler, who was ar

on S. Van Loon, proprietor of the Hotel
Franklin, seems to have had a faculty

Another of HeFs' victims is Louis C. Ho
man, grocer, 1651 Mission street. Last
Saturday Hess entered Homan's store and
by plausible talk got him to cash a check
for $100 on the Bank of Santa Monica,
which proved to be worthless. There may
be other charges against him 1 .
Hess told the detectives' that he was for
a time superintendent of the Canadian
mounted police in the Nome district, and
it is said that his father is Speaker of th-j
Ontario, Canada, Parliament. If the peo
ple he has swindled here do not prosecute

SHORTLY after arriving at his of
fice yesterday Mayor Schmitz Was
interviewed by a Call representa
tive and was asked what steps he
intended to take as to the charges
brought by The Call against thc-
County Clerk. He replied:
*'I propose to deal justly in this matter.
I will first give Mp.hony an ' opportunity
to reply to The Call's charges and will
then ask The Call to appear and produce
evidence against him. I propose to act in
the interests of the people and will, grant
no special favors to any one In the affair.
I will, place Mahony on trial when the
evidence against him Is presented to me
and if I find he is guilty as charged I will
remove him from office.
"I do not think that it is necessary for
the Supervisors to uphold me' in my find
ings. Section 15 of article XVI of the
'Â¦charter says: 'No person shall be eligible
*,to or hold any office, or be clerk or dep
\ity in any office or department, who has
been found guilty of malfeasance in of
fice, bribery or other infamous crime, or
who -.in any capacity embezzled public
funds.' . Â¦ *;f . -
"I think that this provision of th<Â» char
ter gives me every power to act. . I do
not thir.k that the decision of the Su
preme Court that the deputies in the Re
corder's and County Clerk's offices do not
come under civil" service deprlvis", ' the
Mayor of the power to remove an elected
official, for cause. . ;
"The charter gives the Mayor the power

SAYS HUSBAND
IS A BIGAMIST
Clerk Mahony's case last night. He said
that there was a question? as , to whether
the Mayor - had a right i to ; suspend a
county officer v under the provisions of a
municipal . charter.- IJane said:-; "The
question is one i which is open to , consid
erable argument. * Personally I believe
that it IsUn line with the recent decision'
of the Supreme Court in the case ol Crow
ley vs. Freud, in which a question", arose
as to whether the provisions of a munic
ipal charter had the power to regulate j
and determine the qualifications of a
county official. The Supreme Court in this
case decided that the charter had no
power to interfere with the ceunty offi
cers. There may be other statutes under
which the County Clerk or other officials
are amenable in a. case of this. kind,: but
I would rather refrain from discussing
that question offhand. ' The .provisions- of
the charter on the subject in point are of
"course very plain, but the question is, is
the power of the charter applicable in-this
case? Relying on the decision of the"Su
preme Court in the civil service easel
should say that the power, to remove the
County Clerk, for an offense of this' kind
does not lie with the Mayor." -."viri'r'' Â¦
That Mahony is subject to trial. by the
Mayor and removal from office is clearly
covered by section 7 of article XVI of ths
charter. . . Â«^ . .' _
The section rÂ«ads as follows:- '{No offi
, cer or employe of the city andiCdunty of
t San Francisco shall give or promise to
give to any other person any portion of
his compensation, or any money, or val
uable thing, in consideration of having
been or of being nominated, appointed,
voted for or elected to any office or em
ployment; and' if any such promise or
gift be made, the person making such gift
; shall forfeit his office and employment
and be forever debarred and disqualified
from being elected, appointed or employed
in the service of the city and county."

MAHONY'S" OFFENSE -
AND BEMOVAIi: (QUESTION
Uahony was asked' if the records; of .lls
office showed the certificates. -of -appoint
ment of the three men in question. -No
record could be found and. later, , on a
deputy informed Mahony that no certi
ficates h*uL been., filed. Sr .^<-

deputy had the .right to\rriake the;ap

Crimmins or Attorney William F. Her

reappoint Deputy County Clerk R. M.

He explained how Fitzgerald, Frank
Grimes and John Cassidy. were appointed
as deputies and removed by him. after a
few days. His explanation -was as fol
lows: . Â¦Â¦. ..' r, : ''.' : -';V^'... .'.â¢.'â¢â¢â¢..,Â¦..
Mahony dented that any pressure' had
been brought to bear on him by- Boss
Regarding the charge that Mahony had
promised the voters in Butchertown to
appoint a man named Fitzpa trick as a
deputy, the County Clerk said;
"Fitzpatrick worked for me in my
campaign. I did not ask him to quit
working 1 for my opponent or promise that
I would give him a position Â¦ if â¢ I was
elected'. I did tell his friends that. if he
could secure the indorsement of the" Re
publican County Committee it was
possible he would be i appointed as a
deputy in the office. I am very â¢ friendly
toward him and would like- to see him
given a position here.". .- .". '
Mahony next denied that he borrowed
$20 from a saloon-keeper on a promise
to appoint Francis Erb a deputy clerk.
"There is no truth in that story," said
Mahony, ;"and it cannot be proven
asrainst me." Â¦ y
How Fitzgerald Went In.
When Mahony was asked if.it was" not
possible to force appointees to do. certain
things on pain of losing their ! positions
and if clerks in city offices had not been
obliged to give' up certain portions of
their salaries to politicians and bosses in
past years, Mahony replied: i . -
"I -never knew of such a case. I have
heard of such instances, but only, through
the newspapers. It was charged that
such things *were done in Buckley's time,
but I personally never knew of an in
stance."- \ .- â¢ â¢ . '".- ' ' - .
When Mahqny. "wias " pressed to give an
answer to trie question put-to him, he
answered: "-"If 'i'ne Call produces the
aocUment-4t speaks of, why then I wilt
ad some talking." -.â¢"
â¢'Did you or aid you not sign the docu
ment as is charged In The Call?" was
asKed. '.â¢â¢'. Â¦ Â¦ â¢Â¦ -""..-*â¢'â¢ Â¦Â¦'.' '
"Well," to. the best of my knowledge and
belief 1 never signed any such paper,"
replied the County Clerk. . '..' . |
â¢â¢Can you not give an answer, yes or
no, as to whetner you signed such an im
portant- document within -the past few
weeks?" ** Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦ â¢ â¢' â¢.. Â¦ Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦ Â¦ ' '.
â¢ "I repeat my answer," replied Mahony.
"Do you mean that you cannot give a
positive answer on the matter? fauch a
document. Vould surely be impressed on
your mlndl" â¢ â¢ Â¦ .Â¦
"I repeat â¢ that to â¢ the best of my
knowledge and belief I never signed such
a document,", answered the County :Clerk.
â¢â¢What' have you- to say as to the
charge that Crimmina Â¦ made a deal for.
you with'. Bier, & Regensburger, the
money ;brokers, who" in- return ior their,
financial support in your campaign were
"toreceive the business of your office in
discounting the salary warrants of your
deputies?" . . .
'â¢That story is alUrot," replied Mahony,
"I have my campaign expense account on
record and can account for .every dollar
I spent. I know nothing of what Crim
mins did In the campaign and am not re
sponsible for him. 1 know nothing of his
-actions before the election or at -any
other time. It is absurd to say that I
could control the deputies. v of,, my office
and force them to go-- to^nyj particular
-firm to have .th,eir; salary -warrants dis
counted. . When. I discounted my salary
warrants I- was glad to go to any one
who. was willing to discount them.. I
could not forqe any one of my deputies
to dp business* with Bier & Regensburger,
or'ari.v.other'flrm." , _ v Â¦ V
MakesflEvasive Denial.
Again the-, question was put to-Mahpny
as to his knowledge of the document he
signed, promising 'to give a position to
Deane. ""'" 'â¢' ". - v
"Deane is here'," -replied Mahony, "you
had better asK him about.it." .,
"I refuse to answer," replied j Mahony,
"until I have had a charice to see my at-,
torney. Where did The Call get all this
Information from, anyway?" 'â¢
"What have you- to say, Mr. Mahony,
as " to the charges made by- The Call
against you?" was asked. â¢ â¢-. Â¦ . .
When a representative of The Call went
to Mahony's office and knocked on the
door, it was fully five minutes before it
,was opened. County Clerk Mahony, ex-
Couhty Clerk Deane and a man who
stated he was a friend of Mahony were
closeted in the room when The Call rep

Says He Will Tails of
Document When
It Is Shown;
Out at Mahony's house an hour later "Flood and'Ma
hony held an exciting interview. Flood told Mahony "that
The Call knew the whole- business,*' and Mahony threw both
hands up in the air and wanted to know if there wasn't some
way to prevent the publication of the story. ..... , r ; ..
Flood said last night: "I am sorry I got mixed up, in
this thing, but I will not repudiate my signature oiv the con-
tract. I drew up several contracts during the campaign, and :
before I rush into print I want toknow absolutely which one
of therii I am talking about. I saw Vallero to-day^, and he
told me he did not remember signing any contract as a wit-/
ness. I know there was a contract between Mahony and
Deane, but it was nothing to me. I was not mentioned in
it. He did not agree in the contract to keep me in the office,
therefore I have no reason to remember every word .'of it.
When that contract was drawn last October I was rushed
with campaign business, and I want to see the contract
again before I do any more talking about it. I am Billy
Deane's friend, and when I see my signature on that con
tract you can bet all you want that I will not lie about it-"
of the month Deane's name will go downstairs to the Auditor
as the chief deputy of the County Clerk."
That's a sample of Witness Flood's present position in
the squabble.
' In an interview with a Call reporter Monday night
Flood said: "I remember having drawn up the contract in
Mahony agreed to retain Deane. I tjiink- that if this
thing is not exposed Mahony will live up to his agreement.
I will see Mahony and ask him if he intends to keep Tiis con
tract. I will tell him that The Call knows everything; that
they know that I signed the contract as a witness, and that
they know the inside of the whole business. Rather than
have this come out in the paper I think that Mahony will
appoint Deane as his chief deputy. I don r t know whether
or not Vallero remembers signing the contract, but he ought
to. He signed it" ,. , Â» .. .
JOHN FLOOD, stenographer to County Clerk Mahony,
who also served in the same capacity during Deane's
regime, has corroborated the charges against Mahony
made by The Call.
When Flood was first interviewed Monday night he ad
mitted having drawn the contract in which Mahony agreed to
retain W. A. Dearie as his chief deputy in the event of his
election as County Clerk.
Flood grew a bit uncommunicative \on the subject yes
terday, however. He was struggling between his friendship
for Deane and the fear of being ousted from his present po
sition by Mahony. At all events Flood did not repudiate
the admissions made during the course of his on
the previous night. He simply wanted to be a little particu
lar as to which contract he was being questioned about.
"You know, I "drew up so mln~y~ oF them during the
carripaign that I want to be sure which one I am talking
about," explained Flood, suavely. -
Flood's recollection became rather clouded after * the
story was^published. He has a'whol&ome fear of official de
capitation by County.Clerk Mahony, 'and is not anxious to
talk.
"There ought to be some way in which this thing could
be fixed^up/' squirmed Flood. "Mahony is a good fellow,
and I don't think he intended 'to throw Deane down. He
made a contract to keep Deane, and I think that at the end

He is allowing no inkling of. his opinion
to get out and nothing will be made public
until his action is announced. Naval offi
cials profess to feel confident that the
President will uphold Secretary Long and
the findings of- the Court, with the excep
tion of those individually expressed - by
Admiral Dewey. If he fails to do- this,
he will be charged with having given way
to popular clamor, for before Long 1 acted
upon the. findings of the court he sub
mitted his indorsement to .Roosevelt and
the latter approved it. If the President
acts in the Schley case before the rear
admiral submits his appeal, as his pres
ent plan contemplates, friends of the com
mander of the flying squadron will charge
him with unwillingness to consider the
points which will vindicate their hero.
This charge was made by them against
Rear Admirals Benham and Ramsay. Un
mindful of criticism that. may be made,
however, Roosevelt has made his investi
gation and .he proposes to act conscien
tiously, believing that the country will ac
cept his verdict as that of an honest and
.impartial man. /
From the lips of Rear Admiral Schley
he heard that officer's defense. When he
began his Investigation Roosevelt brushed
aside all previous opinions he had enter
tained. As far as possible he placed his
mind in a condition to fairly consider the
facts which he hoped to develop. He has
not consulted Secretary Long or any other
official of the Navy Department; because
he wanted to make a .decision which
would be accepted by the country as his
own. The President has about satisfied
himself as to the character of the con
duct of Rear Admiral Schley- during the
war with Spain. .

Â¦ On recross-examlnatlon Spencer brought
out the fact that the lynchers had met at
the Â¦Â¦>, Alturas . racetrack to arrange and
agree on the story to tell the Grand Jury '
so that body would believe that they were
not the lynchers." Hutton testified further
that he resided . in the Grand Hotel and
made that hotel his stopping place out of
his own choice. ,.: >
Here -ended the -direct crt>ss-examlna
tlon and redirect examination was taken
up by General Post for " the prose
cution. He spent much time In Inquiring
as to the length and . Intimacy- of Hut
ton's acquaintance . with certain members
of the I lynching party. The defense pro
tested. Later, when Post asked Hutton If
he had played' baseball with friends,
Raker protested that the court had ruled
against the : defense when It asked : Hut
ton II he had gone swimming with them
The court would not sustain the objection.
Raker remarked that '"God- la not trying
this case," to which Judge Harrington re
plied, J'No, God and, you are enemies."
, In answer to Post's questions, Hutton
said he had not been restrained his liberty
and that he had not been tutored for his
story. Â¦ Raker objected to these questions
and the court said:' ; â¢

had said that "some fellows" had sug
gested that they keep their own counsel
and asked Hutton when he had dis
covered that It was Polmanter, to which
Hutton replied "Yesterday." 1 .
. "Who talked to you so that your mem
ory was refreshed?" he was asked.
â¢ "Mr. Raker," replied Hutton.
-A titter went around the room; Judge
Harrington declared a recess, and what
might have been one â¢ of the sensations
of the day was spoiled.
After recess the question as to how Hut
ton's memory was refreshed was dropped
and Hutton was questioned as to the re
sistance made by Frank Hall." Next the
defense took up the position of the moon
on the night of the lynchers, Hutton hav
ing said it was high .In the - heavens.
Harris, , for the defense, produced an
almanac for May and Spencer desired to
introduce it. The court refused the re
quest and the debate grew very warm,
but the court would not rescind his order.

the University of California in the annual
Carnot contest: with Stanford will be held
Monday night in Stiles Hall, commencing
at 7:45 o'clock. At the preliminaries held
last night the nine best debaters were
chosen -for the finals. Of this number
three will be selected to compose the team
with one as substitute. . The question will
be: "Resolved, That the President of the

a few minutes. â¢ /

The question as to who was Ihe leader
of the mob came up, calling for a protest
from Post, who said that it had been pro
viously answered. Hutton having testi
fied that Claude Brown â¢ was the leader. \"
Hutton said that five or six of the party
went in for old man Hall, but he did not
remember any conversation, or . who ; hail
charge of the old man. Hair asked what
was wanted, and some one replied:
"We'll show you pretty soon." The lynch
ers went to the , bridge,- .- leaving- â¢ Judge
Myers, Constable Carpenter, Sidney Goy
ette and James Brown - standing on the
porch of the hotel. These men had re-

Spencer offered to show the paper to
the witness, asking Hutton if the portion
objected to was his testimony. Post
objected, saying counsel knew It was
wrong for a lawyer to show a witness
any paper not a document of the court.
Spencer replied that all the counsel for
the prosecution knew could be contained
in a small primer and would then be un
intelligible. Spencer explained that: the
defense had two papers, one a personal
copy and the other notes of an official
reporter. Raker protested that - the Â¦. de
fense was unable to get a certified copy
of the reporter's notes, as the court
would not order It. This caused Har
rington to become very angry and to say:
"Raker, you are getting too obstreper
ous and your remarks regarding the
court are ungentlemanly. I'll .put you
out of this case if you don't behave your
self." . . . Â¦..Â¦Â¦Â»â¢
tentlon, and that only after the meeting
on the bridge were all aware of It.
The lynching party returned to the ho
tel, some of the men, including the wit
ness, remaining outside. Hutton said that
Claude Brown and Louis Polmanter
went to the side of the hotel, got a rope
left there and went inside to guard the
doors; whereas In his direct examina
tion Hutton had said that Morris and
McDaniels got the rope and went back
into the kitchen to guard the doors.
Counsel for the defense began reading
his testimony on direct examination from
an unofficial copy and the prosecution
protested. Raker said that the defense
had asked for a certified copy and had
been unable to get It. ] Further discussion
followed, and Judge - Harrington asked
Raker to show the court the copy In his
possession. Raker refused, on the ground
that it was private property of the de
fense. The Judge became very angry at
what he called the ungentlemanly con
duct of the defense, and said that he
would not permit him to proceed. It Â¦was
the first time, he said, that he ever
heard of counsel refusing to permit the
Judge in a case to look at any paper.
The court refused to lef the witness ex
plain any discrepancies in his testimony.
Raker' then offered the. paper to the
court, but Judge Harrington refused ,to
look at It.
Herbert C. Jones and Edward W. Rice
are students in the law department,
Fletcher B. Wagner is In the Wstory de-'

that a Stanford man last year won the
annual medal offered by Baron de Cou
bertin has kept up enthusiasm and every
one is well satisfied with the showing
made by the successful trio of debaters
who won In the final try-out. The Stanford
team is peculiarly representtive, two of
the debaters being fraternity men and the
third and' the alternate being independ
ent. Â«Two of the four are law majors, one
registers in the department of history and
the fourth in philosophy.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 14.
Never before has so much Inter
est been shown at Stanford In the
Carnot debate, which will occur at
TWO OF THE STUDENTS SELECTED TO ' REPRESENT STANFORD UNIVERSITY IN THE CARNOT DEBATE
TO TAKE PLACE AT BERKELEY IN. FEBRUARY. LAW IS THE MAJOR STUDY OF ONE, WHILE THE
OTHER IS IN THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT AT PALO ALTO. . . Â»
Counsel brought out that It was the
original intention of the mob to hang the
five men. and when asked why the dis
cussion arose the witness replied that
not all present knew of' the original ln-
Raker Angers the Court.
Witness replied that he considered that
he was taking as much part in the hang-
Ing as though he /had thrown Wilson
from the bridge. He fald that after
Frank and James Hall had been hanged
the question as to whether or not old
CalvJn Hall should be hanged came up,
nnd it was decided to hang him "because
be mifrht do some of us some Injury."
"why," asked counsel, "did you *iay
in your direct examination that *we
threw Wilson overT "
Hutton said that while marching from
the schoolhouse to the hotel a halt was
made for the selection of a leader. . He
Â¦was asked to serve but declined and
Claude Brown was selected. Â¦ On arrival
at the hotel the ropes and sacks for gags
were distributed and the men lined up
in pairs. Brown heading the column. The
door to the barroom was opened and the
guards were covered with pistols and or
dered to hold up their hands. The pris
oners stepped up quietly. James Brown
bound the first and then the others. Dur
ing this proceeding Judge Myers came
down from upstairs, opened the barroom
door and was ordered to go back at the
point of a pistol. He went to another door
and said he would kill some one If they
did not get off the place. Constable Car
penter, attracted by the noise, also opened
the door and was ordered back. He did
not appear again. Hutton said that some
of the prisoners shouted and groaned.
Frank Hall, the first man bound, was
taken out by Robert Leventon. John Pot
ter, Isom Eades and Henry Knox. The
witness and Claude Mortis followed with
young Wilson. On the road to the bridge
F"rank Hall managed to get one arm free
and fought his cantors.
Spencer asked Hutton whether he had
had any experience at gagging any one
previous to the lynching, or If he had par
ticipated In the hanging. To this question
objections were interposed and sustained.
Hutton said that Daniel Yantls was the
first man thrown from the bridge and that
Fred Roberts. Jervls Kresgre and Louis
Polmanter, who threw Tantis over, re
turned and asslstqjj Claude Morris and
the witness In hanglnp Martin Wilson,
though the first-named three actually
threw him from the bridge.
Declines to Lead the Mob.
The court, sustaining another objection
later in the session. Raker remarked that
the defense had only the main evidence of
the witness to get the facts from, as
cross-examination was prevented.
"I think the jury would believe the wit
ness as soon as they would you. He is
under oath and you are not," was the
court's comment. .
"That's right, educate the witness," In
terposed Raker.
The court took this as a personal af
front and brusquely sustained the objec
tion of Post after he had himself bade the
Â¦witness to answer.
An objection was sustained. Hutton
said that several of the party had fire
arms, among them Fred Roberts and
Claude Brown, who carried pistols, and
Robert Levenson, who was armed with a
rifle. Spencer questioned Hutton as to
the identity of Roberts, the latter being a
cripple. This ground having been gone
over yesterday, the question brought
forth objection by Post, who said:
"We went over that cripple business
yesterday."
"Let's go over It again," said Judge
Harrington.
Spencer was rather particular in his
questioning regarding the certainty of the
witness that the sacking used for gagging
purposes was coal sacking. Hutton had
distinguished it from barley sacking, say
ing it was coarser and like coal sacking.
Spencer asked:
"How did you know It was coal sacking?
Did you stop to weigh it when strangling
the boy, Martin Wilson? Were you not
excited when lynching Wilson?"
"No, not very," replied Hutton.
"Then it was an easy matter for you,
Mr. Hutton?"
"No, It was not easy and it was not
hard." - Â¦- : â¢
"Murdering that boy did not disturb you
very much then?**
Material for the Masks.
Attorney E. V. Spencer again conducted
the cross-examination. He first took Hut
ton over the ground from the time the
lynchers congregated at the echoolhouse
to the binding and gagging of the prison
ers in the barroom of Myers* Hotel, where
they were kept under the guard of James
Brown and Sidney Goyette. Hutton said
that in addition to bringing sacks for
masking purposes the country party
brought ropes and sacking for tying and
gagging the prisoners and wagon spokes
to be used as clubs. James Brown came
down from the hotel and told the lynchers
he would light a cigar as a signal that all
was ready for the night's work.
cross-examination the defense will have
finished with the witness. Some of the
details related by the lyncher on the wit
ness stand caused shudders to run
through the courtroom crowd. He showed
that the Lookout mob of which he was
a member planned and carried out . the
execution of its five victims as cold
bloodedly as a hunter would slay an en
trapped beast. No humane Impulse led
a sinsrle member of the mob to seek to
make the lynching less brutal. All rev
eled In the torture inflicted upon their
victims. When Daniel Yantls, Martin
Wilson and the two Hall J>oys had been,
thrown from the bridge with ropes around
their necks the lynchers, their blood
thirstiness not glutted, went back after
aged Calvin Hall. They answered the old
man's appeals with rude jest, as though
he were a circus clown to be kicked and
buffeted around for their amusement.
Hutton tells the 6tory from the stand
point of one no less culpable than the
others and omits not a single revolting
detail.

These two pointers showed the most In
teresting race of the day, as both were
speedy, stylish and excellent in range,
Daniels having a little better speed. No
birds were found until the heat was al
most finished, when Dr. Daniels after
making a wide cast, was seen to drop
suddenly to point while running at full
speed. His trainer, who was some dis
tance away, hastened to him and on
reaching him Ashed a large bevy of
birds that were lying in the short grass.
Pearl's Jingle was close at hand, but un
fortunately was not near enough to locate
the birds, so was not credited with a
point.

off at 2:50. After a short run in the open
they were taken to the willows alonff the

made by each, and each scored flushes
also, as they seemed unable many times
to locate their birds in the heavy weeds
and brush along the banks. The brace

Shadow is one of the smoothest moving
dogs in the State, covering grround with
apparent ease and is possessed of consid

slower, was more fortunate and succeeded
in finding three birds In a small clump of
sage, which he pointed In rather an un

careful in his work, but in spite of all

shrubbery. She was found on a stanch
bevy point by Judge Balmer. As the
horsemen rode up twenty-five . or thirty
birds were flushed, but Blossom remained
steady until her handler arrived. Blossom
was by all odds the highest-class dog in
the stake, showing wonderful speed and
range, and using Judgment in working her
ground. Jaccuba seemed a. little off in

TWO MORH NEW CLASSE3
There was nothing to the last race from
the etart but Coming Event, the 12 to 5
favorite. Mounce got the mare away first
and ehe was never headed. King Dellis
secured the place from Sir Lewis.
Winnie O'Connor, on Colonial Girl, the
favorite, took the selling purse for three
year-olds. Overhauling the outsider Kill
doe in the stretch the Eastern filly
downed Jarretierre* d'Or, the ' second
choice, by a couple of lengths. Rubino,
the third In demand, ran to form, captur
ing show honors.
One of the warmest favorite? of the
afternoon. Bragg, ran second to Pat Mor
rissey in the mile and orse hundred yards
run. The old gelding, with "Jess"
Matthews on his back and 7 to 1 in the
ring, picked up the running at ihe start
and lasted long enough to win from the
first choice by a head. Tyranus failed ta
stay, i he show falling to Picador.
A bad favorite was served up for the
opening mile selling run in Merops, which
werft to the post at 8 to a. Frank Weir's
gelding seemed to have no speed, finish
ing back with the tailenders. Mounce, on
the 12 to 1 shot Senator Matte, moved
aloccr frem fifth position and in a drive
led Mont Eagle out a neck. Plead, the
second choice, ran third.
This event waÂ» decided over the Fu
turity couree and with the wire almost
within reach Johnny Daly, astride the
rank outsider J. Boggs, a 90-pounder and
30 to 1 in the betting, dropped along, win-,
niug by a head. Constellator finished third
and the favorite. Headwater, fourth. The
latter behaved none too well at the post,
but finally broke with his company. When
called upon in the stretch, however, he
failed to respond as Is his wont. J. Boggs
is a broken-winded piece of equine hard
ware and to date a maiden, apparently In
capable of winning a cheap selling artair.
It is to be regretted that he was let in
light enough to beat horses entitled ts
more consideration. Kenllworth started

playing unmistakable signs of lameness,

and Pat Morrissey were among the out
eiders to be decorated. Mounce piloted
two winners. i
W. L. Stanfield. tfce tall, mild-mannered
horseman from Texaj3. cut loose onÂ© in
the three and a half furlong spin for two
year-olds quite as fast as Bell Reed.
This one happened to be Lizzie Rice, a
gTay filly by Captive from the gray ghost,
Leora, the "whisiled faced" daughter of
Prince of Norfolk. Hoar, on Hudson, the
favorite, was accommodating enough to
get practically left at the post. Played
for all kinds of money Lee Jackson broke
away first with Lizzie Rice, winning atl
the way. Venecia finished second, in front
of the Burns & Waterhouse entry, Ad
irondack.

horse, looked to have the Reliance Club

Senator Hansbrough presented an
cmencment to the Philippine tariff bill
to-day admitting free of duty hemp
prown in the Philippines and relieving it
from the export duty charg-ed in the Phil
ippines when shipped to the United
States.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 14.â The Republi
can members of the Philippine Committee
have not arrived at any definite agree
ment to amend the Philippine tariff bill.
It is given out as altogether probable that
the rate of duty on Philippine products
coming to this country will be 75 per cent
of the Dingley rates, with a reduction on
goods upon which an export tax Is charg
ed in the Philippines equal to such tax.
Some Republicans are still doubtful about
accepting the proposition, but it is said
the majority favor it.

Prepare for a Display at St. Louis.
Whereas, Commercial organizations repre
senting the various sections of the State and
counties have manifested a strong desire to
secure for their sections or counties adequate
representation; and . .
Whereas. Owing to the fact that the Leg
islature of the State of California will not holtl
a session until the year in which the exposition
is to be held, and which opens early in the
same year. State aid to secure an adequate
representation of the resources of California at
the Louisiana Exposition cannot be expected;
and
The matter of the St. Louis exposition
of 1903 was next considered, and the fol
lowing resolution was unanimously adopt
ed: -
Whereas, The people of St.^Louls, the em
porium of the territory acquired by the United
States by cession from France, in 1903, pro
pose to celebrate the centennial anniversary
of the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory
by the holding of a World*3 : ExpoÂ»ltion of the.
progress of mankind In science, in art,; In
industry, in, commerce and In government; and
Resolved, That this board requests and urges,
our- Senators and neoresentatlves to oppose
BUCh changes, believing them to be Inimical to
the interests of the growers of this State and
the whole country.
Resolved. That the California State Board of
Trade by these resolutions memorialize our
Senators and Representatives In Congress to
oppose such proposed abatement or. removal of
present tariff rates on Cuban sugar and to
bacco and such reciprocity agreement* with
other countries as abate those rates upon citrus
and other fruits and products of our soil. i Â¦
Opposed to Any Abatement.
Whereas* It is proposed that Congress shall
remove or materially abate the tariff on sugar
and tobacco imported from Cuba ;. and.
Whereas, It is also proposed that a general
policy â¢ of reciprocity shall be instituted with
other countries affecting citrus and other fruits
of this State and other products of thÂ« -soil In
the United States: therefore, be It
the East there was prosperity In plenty,
and the only one complaining was the

BOATS AND FERRIESâ S., City. The
first ferry from San Francisco to the
Oakland side was established in 1S50, the
Kangaroo making ;two trips a week be
tween San Francisco and San' Antonio.
In 1851 a small steamer was placed on the
route; in 1852 "the Boston made several
trips and was destroyed by fire. In the
latter part of the year her place was
taken by the Kate Hayes. Â¦ Shortly after
that the Contra Costa Steam Navigation
Company was established with two steam
ers that made regular trips to the foot of
Broadway; Oakland, the fare being Jl
each way. [ In 1857 thÂ« Oakland and San
Antonio Ferry Company came Into exist
ence and in 1862 work on the ferry land
ing on the Oakland side was commenced.
The first trip on thelOakland and Sari'
Francisco railroad was made on the 2d of
September, 1863; the trial trip on the San
Francisco and Alameda road was made
August 13, 1864, to Alameda from the
point, and on the 25th of, August the cars
ran to' High street. The ferry landings a3
they are now,' both. ar the Oakland and
the.Alameda.mole, Â¦ were built by the
Southern .Pacific Company.

MINOR'S CONTRACTâ W., City. In
California a minor cannot given a dele
gation _ of. power, nor under the age of
18 make a contract relating to -real prop
erty or any x Interest therein, or relating
to personal property \ not in his imme
diate possession or control. A minor may
make any other contract than, those
specified, subject only to his power of
disaffirmance. A minor cannot disaffirm
a contract otherwise valid, to pay the
reasonable' value c; things necessary for
his support or that of his family, entered
hro by him, when no \ under the care of
a parent or guardian able to provide for
him or them. '
MINING CLAIMâ M., Portland. Or. .A
minor doing business for himself and in
his own name has the right to dispose of
'whatever he acquired by virtue of loca
tion. The fact that the locator of a min
ing claim is under the age of twenty-one
years does -not render the location in
valid. From these decisions, found in
"Mineral Lands" and. "Landowner," it
'appears that a minor may take up a mln-
Ine claim.
That the railways will fight for delay is well known.
T>*!y will of course exhaust every resource the in
v-"uity of their attorneys can devise for the purpose
..-i interfering ivith the decision of the Commissioners
; nu preventing the enforcement of the new rates on
6;!. The issue is therefore one. in which the railway
corporations once mcre_confront public welfare. By
giving a prompt hearing to the cases the courts' will
icrve the public good. By delaying a decision they
will serve *the interest of the corporations. It is a
case where so much i& at stake that the people have
a right to expect the courts to act with justice and a
proper regard for the interests of industry and
commerce. The cases should be advanced on the
calendar and given right of way' to a speedy hearing.
There will be something very much like a gross in
justice done under the forms of law if a temporary
injunction" be permitted to become an indefinite in
junction. - .
These cases affect ihe community as a whole. The
oil industry of the State has now become so large
that it concerns every manufacturing enterprise that
requires cheap fuel. The cost of transportation for
the oil from the places* of production to the con
sumers is an important factor in the welfare of many
of our largest industrial enterprises. Consequently,
large as the oil industry is, it by no means represents
the whole interest that is affected by freight rates
imposed upon oil. So long as the fixing of rates is
in doubt, so long will there be more or less uncer
tainty as to the price at which oil can be delivered
and that kind of fuel obtained. The inevitable re
sult is a disturbance of industrial activity, whose in
jurious effects are widely felt. It is therefore a mat
ter of pressing importance that the courts give a
hearing to the cases at once and decide them as
speedily as possible.
SO long as the restraining orders of the courts
prevent the enforcement of the decision of the
Railroad Commissioners in the oil rate cases,
so long will roads have all the benefits of a virtual
victory. It is therefore the duty of the courts "to
bring the issue to a speedy trial. The railroads should
uot be permitted, by motions for delay and ' post
ponement, to suspend the hearing indefinitely. It is
clearly an instance where both justice and public in-
Verest require prompt action. â¢
In addressing the Dcmocrats*of Maine Mr. Quincy
said the issue before. the pajrty is that of deciding
whethento return to the, conservatism which marked
its policy before 1896 or to {go forward on the line
of radicalism.; 'To the solution of that issue he,con
tributed this advice: "The party should keep m the

Quincy added that the next nominee of the 'party
should be a "broad-minded, scholarly, man." Where
can such be found outside of Massachusetts? â¢
The leader of themovemerit in the. camp is Josiah
Quincy, the defeated candidate of the party for Gov

much alive Â¦ and "so animated after sucli a crushing
defeat as befell him is not apparent on the surface of
his talk, but it is possible he is trying to raise.apole'
on which he can climb out of danger when the time
domes for the party. to nominate another candidate
for Governor, to face the Massachusetts voters. Mr.
Quincy, in fact, seems to be running for Presidential
"stakes. He is at least doing. more to put a wiggle
into Democracy, than any other man iii the nation,
not even excepting William J. Bryan of loquacious
memory. > '
FOR some reason not clearly discernible at this

A DUTY OF THE COURTS.
MILITARY CADETâ W. R. A., City.

MASSACHUSETTS DEMOCRACY.
There-are of course' serious difficulties: to~ be over
come before the metric system can be generally
adopted in this country. It would subject tho people
to considerable inconvenience to learn â¢measurements
in litres, meters ;and kilograms instead of in quarts
yards and pounds.' It would also' require extensive
readjustments, in .all our scales and measuring imple
ments. The _ obstacles would be most , perplexing; in
land measurements, and might result for a time in' a
. Consul General. Skinner, reports from Marseilles
an incident which occurred at that port. during the
year as an illustration of the desirability of adopting
the metric system in our manufactures. Last August
the. United States naval collier Scandia arrived at
Marseilles with her boiler tubes burned out and un'der
urgent orders to proceed at once to Manila. It was
believed the damage could be easily repaired at M-ar
seilles;-but, though every facility was offered by the
local contractors, it was found that all the" tubing
in the. city had been manufactured according to met
ric dimensions and none of it could be utilized in the
Scandia's boilers without forcing the shells. The
variation was slight, but it was sufficient to prevent
Â£he accomplishment of the work, and the conse
quence was the ship had to wait until new tubing
could be procured from the United- States, thus los
ing three weeks at. a time when her early arrival at
Manila was a matter of great importance.
.Some time ago a British commission appointed to
inquire into the decline in the use of British manufac
tures on the Continent reported that much of the de
cline was due to the preference of the .people for
goods manufactured according to metric dimensions.
Our own , manufacturers as they extend their trade
with Europe and with South America' will find- the
same preference acting as a barrier~"tO;. American
trade. â¢ It would seem, then, that the requirements of
foreign commerce will sooner or later force the
United States and Great Britain to adopt the system
of measurement that now prevails in the commercial
world. : ' - - Â¦ ;
WITH the expansion of our foreign com
merce there has come renewed agitation in
favor of the adoption of the metric system
of weights and measurements. Every civilized coun
try except the United States and Great Britain has
now adopted that system, and the consequence is
that we and- our British cousins are seriously handi
capped in the contest for supremacy in the world's
markets because our measurements , do not â¢ cor
respond, to those of the people whose needs we un
dertake to supply.

The people are familiar "with the For
many a year past it has been known that the annual
deficit in the postal revenues was due to the loss of
money entailed upon the department by the abuse of
the second class mail privilege. ,_The mails were
loaded, down with advertising circulars and with
trashy novels issued in the .form .of periodicals, and
masquerading sometimes as newspapers and some
times as "literature.". -The mail rates paid upon the
fake stuff were far short of defraying the cost of car
fying it, Â«and consequently there was a heavy, loss
"every sear in. that branch of the postal service. which
had to. be- made- up out of the income â¢ from other
classes of mail matter..
'\ .The ruling of, P9stmaster General Smith was re
ceived with /widespread approval, and there is every
reason for believing the new head of the Postoffice,
Mr. Payne, will cordially uphold the order of his pre
decessor.. Hence the appeal to Congress and the
feathering\of a '.-lobby to urge a revival of the old
abuses.' ,-;.' Â¦ - ;.< ; \.
_.. It is to be-i-borne in mind that many important
postal improvements and extension's wait on the at
tainment of a surplus instead of a deficit in the revr
enue. If the old.abuse be authorized 1 and the deficit
reappears at every annual accounting we shall have
to wait a long time for one-cent letter postage, for a ';
better parcels post system and for a \yider extension
of rural mail delivery. It behooves the people,
therefore, to watch caiefully the movement to renew
the old cause of the deficit. There is much for Con
gress to do in amending the postal laws, but* the
'amendments should be made' in the interests of the
public and not in' the direction of giving fakers a
chance- to flood the mails with their worse than
worthless productions. ,. ; Â¦; Â¦ '.

PERSONAL- MENTION.
J. B. X,ankershim said that a reciprocity
treaty would take off the- duty and de
stroy the market for the products under
consideration. It would Injure the State
of California very seriously, and the Gov
ernment, he submitted, should take and
foster these' industries. Orange land, he
said, was assessed $500 an acre, vineyard
land $1500 and raisin land accordingly.
Colonel" Irish, again addressing; the
board, said that those who have invested
enormously in labor and capital made that
investment with the direct encouragement
of the Government itself, and now the
Government should protect them. He be
lieved that the farmer should be given a
chance to diversify his crop and furnish
something for . his aid ana" comfort by
adding substantially to his revenue. In
Colonel,. Irish reiterated' his contention
that the people of America were under no
moral, obligation to- see to the prosperity
of the people of Cuba. . â¢
Object to Reciprocity Treaty.,
There was '^ general discussion of the
Cuban reciprocity treaty, in which Colonel
John P. Irish made a strong argument
against any abatement in the tariff on
â¢ sugar, tobacco and citrus and other fruits.
He said the beet sugar industry in this
pountry was profoundly affected by the
proposition, said he. met in Washing
ton those who were interested In agricul
ture, and all -were opposed to any abate
ment. "When protection is the policy of
this country he believed in having 'its
benefits distributed equally. The farmers
of Michigan, he said, derived greater
profits from beets than from, any other
crop they could plant. "We must remem
ber," said he, "that the farmer is the one
who is deeply affected, and now, that he
has a chance a sentimental argument is
advanced looking to the prosperity of the
people of Cuba.' This Government is un
der obligation to see first to the prosper
ity of its own people. Capital is already
in Kansas, Iowa and Missouri and various
parts Tbf the cquntry to multiply the re
sources -of sugar,' but now stands para
lyzed waiting to see what Congress will
do.' The- Secretary of Agriculture is in
flexibly opposed to an abatement, but the
President and- Secretary of War are in
favor of it. Unless the people of the coun
try let their sentiment on the matter be
known the poor farmer will be 'ditched.' "

can delegation has practically ceased to attend the
sessions, and those from Chile and the Argentine Re
public have looked at each other through their eye
brows." Colombia and her neighbors have; been in
trouble at home, and Venezuela is in the throes of., a
revolution. There seems tft be no common point. on
which the United States can meet our:; southern 1 
neighbors, and those neighbors have found but one:
sentiment to which they have all. thrilled in response. :
That sentiment was called out at the^first â session. by ; .'
a eulogy of Spain as the mother.. country -and the
Latin race as the mother race of tri^Seventy; millions'
of people who inhabit Central and^Scmtb "America/; Â¦-/
.It is evident that affairs in this* hemisphere, must'
take the same course they have followed for ages= in
Europe. National ambitions will' be â¢substituted for
dynastic hopes, and there will be" wars land rumors of
wars, and the political geography, of Central and
South America will undergo changes as great as
those effected by Caesar, Frederick the Great, Na
poleon and Bismarck. It is difficult to see how the
United States can prevent, the strong from feeling
and using their strength and how we can protect the
weak in the' day of their trial.
We can protect what interests . we have against
spoliation, and can interpose against European terriâ
torial aggression by asserting the Monroe doctrine,
and that is all. . ,,
The plan and purpose of the present congress were;
praiseworthy, and the same can be said of their pre
decessors^ but nations dislike to bind themselves to
any limitation, against expansion of their boundaries
and their power. If treaties of arbitration were made
the strong would break them at will and the w'eak"
would appeal to them in vain. If a railroad is to be
built lengthwise of South America, on either side of
the Andes, it will be constructed by European capi
tal or that from the United States, which will be VT&u
der the protection of Governments other than thosev
whose territory it traverses. The freedom of such'av
line will be guaranteed to commerce by such a treaty!
as enables us to protect the Panama railroad and or
der Government and revolutionary troops alike to
stop firing when the engine bell rings.
Any general scheme of banks will be instituted and
protected in the same way, and the treaties to effect
these objects will be made by the nations separately,
each in its sovereign" capacity, and not in such a
meeting as that in Mexico. -
Independence is independence. It cannot have any
limitations. It must be free to get into trouble or
to get others into difficulty. This idea of indepen
dence seems to dominate the Central and South
American republics, and they seem determined to'
seek their national destiny, as other independent
states have done before them.
The- next serious cftort to- combine the American
nations in a common' policy upon certain essentials
was made by Blaine. The time of that conference
was too much taken up by a discussion of the silver
question, which was then a hot issue in our politics.
Enthusiasts, who believed in a hemispherical millen
nium, thought it possible to have a'coinage common
tp all the countries , represented, and this, with. such
grand projects as a railway from the Rio Grande to
the Straits of Magellan, exhausted the time and the
energies of the delegates. The present congress, sit
ting in the City of Mexico, has discussed much and
concluded nothing. It has listened to plans for a
Pan-American bank, and the railroad project has
been feebly revived, but no conclusion has been
reached. The rock on which the body has chosen 1
to split is compulsory arbitration. The strong; coun
tries like Mexico and Chile, which have troubles of
their own and are capable of making more for their
neighbors, have shied, from arbitration. The Mexi-
THE first Pan-American conference, planned to
meet at Panama, never met at all. Its failure
was due to the United States. The Senate dis
agreed over instructions to our delegates, and the
discussion of' general American peace ended in the
duel between Clay and Randolph, in which the Rep
resentative from Roanoke had a hole'torn in his coat
by Clay's bullet and Clay got a lesson in magnanim
ity by Randolph firing in the air. .

FUL CAREER IN THE STATE OF HIS ADOPTION.
Captain Hall was then examined.
"Was there any disorder among your
crew?" he' was asked. '." -
"The only disorder I saw was made by
two drunken waiters," the captain replied.
"I told the steward to put the men below
and tell them that if I saw any more of
them I would put them in irons. I gave
orders to the purser and bartender never
to sell liquor to the officers or crew.'Â»
The witness volunteered the statement
that on Christmas day. on the trip before
the Walla Walla was lost, he caught the
third and fourth officers drinking in vio
lation of the rules. He disrated them at
the time and went below to promote the
quartermasters to their places, but found
them drinking with the freight clerk. He
said he would have discharged them at
Victoria, but it was not an American port,
and he discharged/ the five men in San
Francisco. The witness spoke very high
ly of Third Officer Hughes, who was in
charge of the Walla Walla at the time she
collided with the Max.
â¢ The Investigation will â¢ continue this
afternoon.
Crew Was Orderly.
Peter Harold, a water tender on the
Walla Walla, was then called and told
of the coolness that pervaded the men in
the- engine-room. He said he did not
realize the steamer was about to sink,
otherwise he would not have gone below
and "blown down" the boilers. He
thought the collision occurred about
4:15 a. m.Y 'â¢â
S. Williamson, barkeeper on the Walla
Walla, testified that there was a rule on
the ship not to. sell liquor to the crew and
that he always lived up to the rule. He
admitted he sold liquor to waiters, but
understood it was for passengers. To the
best of his knowledge the officers of the
ship had not partaken of any liquor.
Williamson said the morning the Walla
Walla sailed some of the passengers
showed evidence of having drink in them.
He stated that he remained .on the ship
until she sank; that he was picked up by
a raft and later by the Dispatch. The
witness said the discipline on the Walla
Walla was good and that the men lowered
the boats as if they were going through
the fire drill.
Frank Haughwout, an oiler, gave testi
mony that* was unimportant.
Second Officer Lupp was again recalled.
He swore that when Mr. Hughes relieved
him the latter was sober and knew what
he was doing. He said the steamship did
not sink bodily, but by the head. Lupp
said the Walla Walla went down like a
boat "shooting the chutes." He said he
examined the staterooms on the saloon
deck and found them empty.
i "How long was it after the lookout re
ported the white light before the ships
came together?" asked Captain Bolles.
"I can't say, because I was writing up
the log," was the reply. "When the look
out reported the white light Mr. Hughes
yelled 'Port!' I paid no attention to this,
believing that the course of the ship was
changed to get out of- the other ship's
way. Almost immediately, I think, I
heard "hard a-port" and then the vessels
collided."
Frederick Lupp, second officer of the
Walla Walla, was recalled. His testi
mony was similar to that given when first
examined. He swore that Third Officer
Hughes was on the bridge on the port
side at the time of the collision; but this
was in conflict with testimony he gave
last week. He then said Hughes was
standing 1 behind him in the charthouse.
Lupp neiterated the statement that
when the lookout reported there was a
white light on the port bow Hughes left
the charthouse and stood on the bridge.
"When the lookout reported a green
light on the port bow, did you hear him?"
asked Captain Bolles.
"No. sir," was the reply. "I was writ
ing at the time. But I heard Hughes
yell, 'Hard a-port!' Not hearing a reply
from the man at the wheel, I repeated
the order by hollering through the scut
tleand asked why he did not answer."
Charles Gleason, a miner, who was a
passenger on the steamship, told of his
escape from the sinking vessel and the
thrilling time; they had in reaching shore.
His testimony was no different from that
already, published. * '^

Lupp Is Recalled.
The Inspectors of Hulls and Boilers ex
amined a number of witnesses yesterday
In their Investigation of the collision be
tween the AValla/ Walla and: the Max.
Most of the testimony was- similar to
that already published. The Investiga
tors, however,, were anxious to thresh out
the' whole matter. Captain Hail stated
that he had discharged five members of
his crew the previous trip for drinking on
shipboard. He made the amusing state
ment that when he found two officers
drunk during that voyage he went below
In search of two quartermasters to.pro
mote to their places and f Qund them
drunk also. The captain admitted that
he saw two waiters. drunk on the steam
ship's last voyage.
Saw 'Drunken Waiters.
J. A. Sells, a mining man, who was a
passenger on the Walla Walla, testified
that two waiters on the steamship were
drunk the night before the collision. He
said they were in hi3 stateroom drinking
with Captain Gilbert, a passenger, and
that he became disgusted and left them
there. The witness swore that the offi
cers and crew were sober and did not act
out of the way. i
Mr. Sells', in the course of his testimony,
told how he assisted the crew in lower
ing boats and helped the lady passen
gers to leave the steamship. He stated
he did not leave the sinking vessel until
she made her final plunge; that he jump
ed into the water and swam to, a raft,
and was struck by the mast of the steam
ship when it sank. His testimony showed
that the members -of the Walla .Walla's
crew worked without excitement and did
everything in their, power to save pas
sengers. â¢ ... â
P. Abramson, a sailor on the Walla
Walla, stated that he was asleep in the
forecastle; that he was awakened by the
collision, and when he came on deck ho
saw the French, bark, but could see no
lights on her. He said the crew behaved
itself and that there jvas no fighting In
the forecastle. â¢ .â¢ ' â¢ "
George Peters, a member of the Walla
Walla's crew, followed and testified alons
the same lines.

His Bill for Southai^gton

Hope. *
'Eight- Year-Old Request for
Quarry Point Station May .
v . Be Renewed. ?
a The fate of Congressman Julius Kahn's
bill asking for an appropriation from Con
gress of- $30,000 for theâpurpose of estab
lishing a lighthouse and fog signal sta
tion \ on f Southampton Shoals will be
watched with/considerable interest by lo
cal shipping folk. The publication in yes
terday's Call of the fact that J the Con
gressman from the Fourth District had
introduced .and was championing ' such a
measure gave rise to much discussion in
maritime circles. Â¦ . ' â¢
The proposed site for this new danger
signal is at the southern 'extremity of the
Southampton Shoals and directly on tho
line of tiie Santa Fe ferry route between
San Francisco and Point Richmond.
The shipowners of the port have for
eight years been trying to get a light and
fog signal. at Quarry Point, the eastern
extremity of. Angel Island.' They are now
speculating as to whether the Santa Fe
people will be able to accomplish for their
own exclusive benefit what/ local efforts
have failed to bring about 'for the good
of the shipping of the port in general.
Quarry. ifoint. is right on the deep chan
nel leading to Port Costa and otner up
river points. A light and fog signal sit
uated thero would enable the navigator
to I get his bearings and shape a safe
course at night or during foggy weather.
The necessity for a station at Quarry
Point manifested itself long ago. Ships
went ashore on Angel Island and on
Southampton Shoals;* navigation between
bay and river was and stUl is. full of
danger in foggy weather. The Light
house Board was appealed to, but, while
appreciating the necessity" for the aid to
navigation, was , helpless to act without
Congressional sanction and assistance.
A petition was prepared eight yeara'ago,
signed by every shipowner, river steamer
captain and towboat man in the port and
indorsed by the local inspectors of the
lighthouse department. Since then re
peated efforts have been made to get the
Government to take action, but in vain.
A Good Advice.
Come around and buy yourself a $15 to
$18 men's suit for $4 15; for. your boy a
waist for 15c, or knee pants 10c. . You need
not go without stockings when you can
buy them for 5c at the old Monarch, 915
Market street. Anything to make room

B. Gondolphl, a quarryman employed
by Gray Brothers, yesterday morning
found the dead body of an unidentified
man lying at the foot of the quarry cliff
on Sansome street, about seventy-five
feet from Gr'een street. At the polfU
where the body lay the cliff is
almost perpendicular and about one hun
dred feet high. The man's arms* were
broken, his clothing torn and the"* skin
peeled off the palms of his hands, evi

by catching -at the face of the ' cliff in
his descent. \ ! â¢ Â¦-
Nothing was found on the person of the
deceased by which he could be identified,
the only articles being twenty-five cents
and a silver finger-ring. He was about
40 years old; five feet seven inches tall
and 150 pounds weight; fair complexion,
blue eyes, reddish mustache and eye
brows, regular features and good teeth.
The clothing was a black derby hat, dark

ing to the testimony introduced yesterday.
The will in which she disposed Of the
property, according to the claims of the
heirs, was made in 1888. Diligent search
on the part of the interested parties ha3
failed to reveal the whereabouts of the
document and the probating of the will,
which the attorneys for the absent heirs
contend never existed, is being . bitterly
opposed. Miss May Costello and Mrs.

TWENTY YEARS
FOR ROBBERY
Judge Cook Makes an
Example of Jackson
Williams.
Peculiar Case of John Sheehan
Heard in judge Mogan's
. Court. Â¦
Jackson "Williams, the colored man who
was convicted of robbery by a jurjv in
Judge Cook's court Monday, appeared for
sentence yesterday. He robbed Harry
Carlson, a sailor, in the early morning of
December 7. The Judge sentenced him to
serve twenty years in Folsom peniten
tiary. In passing- sentence the Judge said
that robbery and burglary were crimes
committed by men who would, not hesi
tate at murder. Both crimes were preva
lent in the city and he was determined to
lend his aid in putting a stop to theni'by
Inflicting the severest penalty. He was
satisfied in Williams' case that if Carlson
had offered any resistance he would only
Jiave stopped at murdering him.
As showing the, number of these ' cases
recently,. Captain Seymour yesterday
compiiea a statement showing tnat -Bineo
pecember 10 eighteen men nave befcn heUi
lQ r robbery and fourteen for burglary,
and that there are seven robbery and m'x
burglary charges pending in the Police
courts. Besides" these there were nine
cases of grand larceny.
Thomas Calvin, the bartender who was
arrested along with Anita Clark for bru
tally beating and robbing Mrs. J. N. Foote
in her rooms at the Elysium, was surren
dered by his bondsmen yesterday, and
judge Mogan exonerated them. The pre
'"ninary bearing of Galvin and the woman
will be held Saturday, when it is expected
Mrs. Foote will be sufficiently recovered
to testify.
The case of F. H. Mack, charged with
robbery, was called in Judge Mogan'3
court yesterday, but the complaining wit
ne ,ss, E. J. King, 1237 StocKton street,
failed to appear. The Judge issued a
bench warrant for King's arrest and the
case was continued tiU>'riday. Mack and
another man, who escaped, robbed King
at California and Montgomery streets
about 1 o'clock Sunday morning, and a
silver watch stolen from King was found
on Mack, who was chased and captured.
The taking of testimony in the prelimin
ary examination of John Sheehan, known
as "Whistling Jack," on the charge of
robbing Sears a saloon-keeper, was con
cluded before Judge Mogan yesterday alt
ernoon and the Judge said he would ren
der his decision this morning.
Sears is a member of the firm of Sears
& Foley, saloon-kepers. East and Wash
ington streets, and shortly after midnight
November 24, while he was drawing a
glass of beer he was struck from benind
and knocked to the floor unconscious.
When he recovered the lights were out
and he found that $220 which he had under
the counter was gone. He notified Police
man McGowan, but said he could not tell
who the robbers were. He was confined to
his bed for seventeen days, and on the
third day, while thinking in bed, he came
to the conclusion that Sheehan and Billy
McGreevy were the men who robbed him.
He also testified that just before the blow
was struck he heard a voice which resem
bled that of Special Officer Joseph Mc-
Greevy saying, "Get in there! Why don't
you get in?" When asked why he did
not have McGreevy arrested also he, said
he thought it was best just to have one
arrested at a time.
A number of witnesses were examined
for the defense to prove an alibi and also
as to character. Sheehan denied knowing
anything about the robbery, and Baid.th.it
when he heard that, Sears blamed him he
went to the saloon and told Foley, Sears'
partner; that he knew nothing about it.
but if they wanted him they conld lind
him at work on the Santa Fe road.

NEW ADVERTISEMENTS.
Nine-tenths of the diseases of the scalp
and hair are caused by parasite germs.
The importance of this discovery by Pro-
fessor Unna of the Charity Hospital,
Hamburg, Germany, cannot be 1 - overesti-
mated. It explains why ordinary hair
preparations,' even of the most expensive
character," fail to cure dandruffâ because'
they. do not and. they cannot kill the dan-
druff germ. The only hair preparation in'
the world that positively destroys, the
dandruff parasites that burrow up the
scalp into scales, called scurf or dandruff,
is Newbro's Herplcide. ." In addition to its
destroying - the ' dandruff germ Herpicide
Is also a delightful halr-dressingr, making
the hair glossy and soft as silk.
Parasites Cause, All Hair Troubles.

;. WHEATâ The failure of George H. Phillips
on the Chicago Board of Trade , was ; the sen
sation yesterday and lowered prices all over
the . world, \ though the decline was . slight, as
powerful interests stood under the market, and
the large lines of shorts out prevented a panic.
Rye caused Phillips' downfall. He tried to
transfer his holdings of Rye to.Armour, and if
he could have . done so might have weathered
the crisis, but after some negotiation with
Armour the latter declined to take the Rye,
which at that time was 69c. Phillips waa
accordingly forced to throw up his hands. Rye
dropped to 60c, the failure was formally an
nounced and Armour took In the Rye at 60c.
There were sold for Phillips' account 5,500,000
bushels of wheat, 1,250,000 bushels of rye.
400,000 bushels of corn, 600,000 bushels of. oats
and 8000 barrels of pork. Wheat, -of course,
was very nervous and â¢ excited under the fail
ure, but there were more buyers than sellers at
the decline, and the Northwest .bought freely.
Bradstreet's gave the world's supply as fol
lows : East of the Rockies, a decrease of
1,328,000 bushels; .Europe and afloat, . an in
crease of 800,000; net decrease, 528.000 bushels.

NEW YORK, Jan. 14.â There . was a con
siderable disturbance of speculative sentiment
In the stock market to-day and . the movement
to sell gained increasing force. The weakness
became rather acute in the final hour, when the
heaviest selling of the day was done, and the
market closed active and weak and generally
at the lowest, net losses running all the way
from 1 to 6 points for the principal stocks.
There were tome special causes of -weakness
of . Individual etockts, wnlch anected tne gen
eral market by sympathy to tome extent, out
the movement as a whole was due to general
causes, wnicn have been gaining an innuence
for several aays pat t. Ail minor -. dliierence a
of interpretation over the standing 'or the caÂ»e
against the Northern Securities Company are
sunk- in the general consideration that tne le
gality of the combination is to be submitted
10 determination 'by the courts, and that the
value of Us securities is to be in abeyance
during a probable prolonged' litigation. Tne
tearing of the decision on other combinations,
not only those made but some others in con
templation, makes the decision of this case of
vast importance to - the whoie eecunties mar
ket. The difficulties developed in the several
Industrial combinations which... have suffered
from impaired credit have given rise to a much
more conservative spirit among lenders ot
money and buyers of securities. To-day'e up
set in the grain markets resulting from over
commitments in speculation, brought some li
quidation directly on . the stock market. Be
sides these general considerations. Wail Street
had rumors that a new bond issue by the Erie
Railroad Company was. imminent and on these
stocks of the company declined IVi and 2%
per cent. The Atchisons were heavily sold on
continuing dissatisfaction over the debenture
bond issue. Aside from these instances, the
selling was pretty well distributed. Thre .was
a period of some strength in the morning, led
by Manhattan with a rise of 1%, but that
stock fell with the. rest of the .market. . Glu
cose rose 3% in the face of the general decline.
Sterling exchange was somewhat easier, lead
ing to the supposition that gold may not be ex
ported, after all. this week, but the market
was little affected by this development and by
the liberal gains of cash on sub-Treasury oi>e
rations. The payment to r day of $Â«OO,O(X) in re
demption of -the Hawaiian loan assumed by the
United States will accrue to the benefit of .the
market. .'" ' Â¦ '
Active bonds were weak, in sympathy with
stocks, but Eome less active issues held early
gains; Total -sales. â¢ par' value, $3,675,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call. â¢ Â¦ . - Â¦ . - '
The announcement this morning that a prom
inent grain trader had failed '. to meet his obli
gations, . having been - caught heavily long : on
wheat," .corn and - rye, on 1 country account,
aroused great excitement., for \ a time on the
Produce Exchange, which was attended by a
decided - break . In prices. , May wheat droppeJ 1
over lc a bushel and .corn %c. Big stop-loss
orders were reached on' the decline and through
out the day nervousness prevailed In wheat and
corn. The country. was an especially big seller,
having been a persistent bull for the last month
or so on slender margins. One ' local trader
covered 100,000 bushels . of rye in Chicago- at
60 cents, the lowest price it has touched. | In
the afternoon exporters came 'in and .bought
about thirty-five loads of wheat, with rumors
that upward of seventy loads would be worked
before the day * r as out.- *Thls rallied the late
market %c and closed it steady. ,.Â¦ â¢ . i ;â¢

CHICAGO, Jan. 14."â There was tumult to
day in the grain pits. For a . time j a.1 panlo
of depression threatened everything. â¢ All ether
news was subordinate to . the failure ' of
George H. : Phillips to advance margins oh
his deals and the consequent' unloading of
many millions of bushels of After
the early wide and rapid fluctuations and a
heavily, short market had ! absorbed the Phil
lips stuff, â¢ to the profit of \ many a bear, the
markets - quieted and gradually '.'came under
usual The close was much better
than had been expected. May wheat suffered
a net loss of %c, May. corn %@%c, May oats
%@%c and May rye 3c. . Provisions closed
independent, .10@12%e to 15@17%c higher. â¢ :
'When Just before the opening of the board
the\notice was posted'at the-request of Phil
lips that houses having open deals, with him
close them out at once, Â¦ traders became badly,
frightened, f Late last night ; it waa known
that' Phillips was in a- tight pinch to make
good his margins because j of . the small raid
on : his rye i deals | made yesterday. ' Bears Â¦ in
the wheat I pit began ' augmenting the sine : of
the , load of long wheat which rumor credited
him with. $ Bulls , who I had been .wavering for
the past few . days became frightened, . and the
result was that whenthe starting gong sound
ed May wheat was selling. lc tol%@l%cdown
at ; 80%@S0c. Such- prices were bargains to
the . heavily â¢ short bear : crowd and . everywhere
covering .was the â¢ feature. \ ; But ' liquidation
both. by longs and the Phillips houses kept up
at a tremendous rate. The Phillips stuff was
estimated at five and a half millions, almost
all of i which .was put, out- at the very start.
The .large short account is "credited with hav
ing saved- the market from a panic. Â¦ Cover
ing and: some late , bull support put the price
for May up again to 81 '/c, but the effect of
the -failure ! was still ' felt, j and -the Â¦ market
sagged to 80%c. ' By. the noon hour the usual
conditions. began to have their effect and; the
market quieted down., The â¢> slightly Â¦ lower
cables which were overlooked at the opening
showed .but .a small reflection of. . the weak
ness Â¦ in* the' market yesterday and the con
tinued Â¦ reports of no moisture in the . winter
wheat belt helped - press prices upward - again.
Some bulls ' came Into the market at the low
prices and -May closed barely weak, %c down,
at 81@81%c. \ ,. ;.
Corn .opened; weak and lower, i The selling
for the Phillips account was estimated (at half
a million bushels. Reactions were the same
as in wheat. May. opened 1%@1%c to %@%c
down at 64%@65c. Selling orders, were much
in evidence throughout the session. The cash
situation was dull and the salvation of the
pit rested almost entirely on the covering of
the heavy short accounts." After the opening
slump there was a sharp reaction to 65%c.
slightly above yesterday's close. The advance
was lost, . however, when wheat weakened
again. There was some attempt at bulling and
late in the session the reaction brought a
close only slightly weak, . %@%c lower at
65%c. , .. Â¦ Â¦
Oats had the same troubles to contend
against as the other pits. There were about
600,000 bushels sold here to close the Phil
lips deals. As in other markets, shorts were
the buyers. This pit, however. . showed a
considerable importance at the opening. - May
started %@%c lower at 45c, slumped to 44%c,'
but jumped back quickly to 46%c..,%c higher
than yesterday. A good many traders who
sold short at the opening were 'caught . for
losses, but after the ' early excitement trade
quieted , down and eased materially. Bulls
did t not attempt much support to this mar
ket. May closed steady, %@%c lower,' at
45%c. Â» - Â¦ ;'
â¢ Rye. the pit which caused all . the . trouble,
had the â¢ hardest day of all. Yesterday the
"fancy" deal . which Phillips, is said to riave
started was raided by one or two elevator
concerns and at one time there was 3c depres
sion. Support had buoyed prices up,"- but
brokers became afraid of the , Phillips deals
and had demanded the full 10 per' cent mar
gin. He was understood to be over l,00o.m)0
bushels long and when his closing notice was
posted at- the opening May prices were: 4 %@
5%c down' at 62<g61c. The heavy liquidation
that began at once was more than this usual
ly small pit could stand, and May dropped
even to 60c. At this figure short covering
and long buying -by a prominent house which
absorbed nearly all the Phillips stuff brought
a reaction to 65c. The close was weak, -3c
lower, at 63%c. - .
Provisions showed marked strength and i in
dependence Immedlatelv ' after the' opening.
At the start there was a depression on the
grain slump, but outside buying, and an im
proved hog market buoyed prices < to Â¦ a firm
close. May pork closed 15@17%c up;' lard
7%@10c higher, and ribs 10@12%c advanced.

Little Flossie is far from recovered from
the frightful shock of the" experience and
she is confined to her bed at her uncle's
home. Her father is dead arid her mother,
married again, has been living In Hono
lulu. The mother and daughter have not
seen each other for several years. The
theory that Flossie may have been mis
taken for some other child is not con
sidered plausible by, the police.
After an all-day search the detectives
uncovered only two points, that might be
of any service. The girl was seen near
her home on her way. from the grocery
about"7:55 o'clock. Â¦ She was also seen to
leave ' the store and start toward home,
after securing -the ..groceries. A boot

WALTER MOKOSCO'S WTLL
NOT TO BE CONTESTED
Oliver Horosco Denies That He or
His Brother Contemplate
Such Action. . ' ' " '
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 14.â There ap
peared In an * afternoon local paper to
day a sensational story to the effect that
Oliver Morosco and his brother, Leslie,
would contest the will of the late Walter
Morosco of San Francisco on the ground
that decedent had been unduly influenced
to ignore the contestants in his will. The
late theatrical manager bequeathed to
Oliver Morosco the Burbank Theater, ia
this city, but Oliver asserts that the
elder Morosco owned no interest in the-
Burbank; that it is and had been for
two â¢ years his. (Oliver Morosco's) exclu
sive property.
Oliver- Morosco was seen to-nJght in re
gard to the publication and denied posi
tively that he or his brother had any in
tention of contesting the will.
"I ' am â¢ surprised that neither my
brother nor myself received a legacy
from Mr. Morosco," said he, "but I em
phatically deny that I have given any
intimation that either of us had any in
tention of making a contest. I have
never given such a move a. thought, and
have no intention of doing so."
The escape'was ; made between 9 o'clock
last 'night and 6 o'clock, this morning,
when the prisoners were called to break
fast "It is the custom"* at the Jail to lock
the prisoners In -their -cells" at 9 o'clock at
night. It was after ' that - hour - that the
trio took the opportunity to break away
the last bar. Â¦_ :Â¦ ". Â¦"/

Discovery of the Break.
Altogether the escaped prisoners sawed
twelve pieces of Iron, from, one to two
Inches thick. In order to deaden the
sound caused by the rasping of the saws
the men tore up their clothing and
wrapped it tightly about the bars. The
cloth was still about them when the frag
ments were found. The ' prisoners evi
dently took turns at the work and labored
at the most opportune time, when they
began the work the jailers do not-venture
to say. While the Salvation Army .was
singing in the jail Sunday last a visitor
informed one of the ' jailers" that he
thought he heard th,e grating of saws,
but the jailer did not investigate. -.
How- the saws got into the hands of
the prisoners is a mystery. Â¦Â¦ After the
escape of Kelly and Case many of thÂ«
privileges of the other prisoners were
curtailed and they were not permitted to
receive visitors. A search of the jail. at
that time, too, failed to reveal the pres
ence of any. more saws. Five worn saws
were found in the vacant cell this morn
ing by the jailers. Beside them was a
bottle of muriatic acid that had been used
to reduce the resistance of the steel. How
the bottle got into the jail Is another mys
tery that la puzzling the jail officials.
"When the prisoners dropped from their
broken cell to the pavement of the jail
yard they took with them a blanket and
a mop handle, to the end of which was
attached a hook made -of -thick wire.
These they used in climbing over the
wall They are supposed do have â¢ made
a ladder of their bodies so that when one
man climbed to the top of .the human pile
he was enabled to reach. the coping. Once
there i he could . have 'fixed' the improvised
ladder that was composed of "the" hook
and strips of the blanket 5 in the wall bo
that' his fellows could join him' at tho
top. ' After the men reached the top it
was an easy matter for them to drop to
the ground by means of the blanket lad

Were Well Supplied' With Saws.
- OAKLAND, Jan.' 14.â For the second
time within three weeks a jallbreak has
occurred at the County Jail. Three men.
who were inmates of the strongest cell
in the jail, cleared the way to liberty by
sawing through twenty-one Inches of iron
bars and climbing over the high stone
wall that surrounds the prison.
The prisoners who escaped are Frank
Caldwell, Fred Smith and James Mur
phy, all of .whom -.were awaiting trial
on charges of burglary. They were im
plicated in the robbery of the home of
Hermann Bendel and were part of the
gang of nine men who were caught in
a barn on Third street several months
ago by Chief of Police Hodgkins. With
them was captured a houseful of booty
and burglars' implements, their depreda
tions having annoyed the police and prop
erty owners for weeks.
1 The men freed themselves from bondage
in much the same way as did Charies
Kelly and Frank Case, who escaped from
the jail Christmas night, except that the
trio who worked out last night were com
pelled to remove greater. obstacles. *irst
they cut away eight bars of. flat iron
two and a half inches wide and a quar
ter of an inch thick that formed a portion
of the window oÂ£ cell No. 8 in the south
or Grand Jury corridor, â¢ in which .they
were confined. They next cut away a
bar. one and a half inches thick that was
in the grating over the window. Again
they sawed through two iron stanchions
that held an iron shield- over the grating
and prying it outward with one of the
heavy bars they. had cut away were able
to jump to the pavement of the jail yard.
After this escape was easy., for climbing
over the- high stone wall was only the
work of a few minutes. - -Â¦
The ten me$ who lost their lives were
the only persons in the pit and no one was
left to tell the story. An the bodies were
recovered, and as none was burned the
conclusion is that death was due to after
damp. The explosion did not injure the
shaft, which is a new one, and the fire
that followed was put out before }t did
much damage.
The sound of the explosion was heard
plainly above ground and rescuers wcra
at work promptly. The explosion occur
red at a depth of 240 feet. The machinery
was not injured by the explosion and
miners working at the mouth of the pit
descended as soon as it was safe. .
â¢ The condition of the mine indicated that
the men might have made their escape.
The bodies were found within a compara
tively small radius. The fire was put cut
before it had reached any of them and
the last man was brought to the surface
before midnight. The victims have been
in the employ of the company for some
time and most of them were men of
family. . . . .â¢
The Milby & Dow Mining Company,
which owns the shaft, is one of the heav
iest operators in the Choctaw Nation.
The principal stockholders are A. Dow of
Houston, Tex., and John Milby of Dallas,
Tex. They operate mines at Dow, Gowen
and Hartshorne. Mine No. 9, at which
'the explosion occurred, had not yet been
thoroughly opened and It had no fire in
spector. Experienced mining men marvel
that the gas should have accumulated in
sufficient Quantities in a new mine to
cause such a disastrous explosion.

at some length regarding the unreliability

to the outbreak.
, Lodge, Hoar's colleague, said he regard
ed the resolution as a reflection on the
Philippine Committee, of which he' is
chairman, and the necessity for the latter
would cease were this resolution adopted.

Special Dispatch to The Call
Captain Wilson says the new company
has no intention at present of doing any
business outside of the port of San Fran
cisco, but may in time extend its lines
into other fields.

The directors named are H. "W. Goodall,
J. W. Bennett, H. P. Wilson, J. H. Sellers
and Edwin T. Cooper.
Articles of incorporation were filed yes
terday by the Western Repair and Sup

company are intimately connected with
the shipping interests of this port. At

kins & Co., the owners of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company. It is said the
new company intends making a bid for
a Government transportation contract in
case the army transports are taken off
the Philippine run.
According to a Etatement made last
night by Captain H. P. Wilson, who is
named as one of the directors, the com
pany is formed by the consolidation of
two firms â the Lewis E. Spear Company,
composed of Lewis Spear, president, and
H. P. Wilson, secretary, and Madison,
Bruce & Sellers, of which B. H. Madison'
is the president and H. B. Madison the
serretary*and treasurer. _
New Company Formed.
T hardly think .".ny such proposition could
possibly he made. It is safe enough, whatever
we do about the transport*, to go upon the
assumption that the Government will always
ship He men from San Francisco, and as a
natural course of events most of the Govern
ment' f freight will follow the route over which
its mÂ«a go.
When the Government comes to make thiB
new contract we shall be very cold-blooded
about it. and we shall make & contract that
will be to the Government's advantage. I can
not see how any company operating, or propos
ing to operate, from Seattle -can possibly make
a proposition u> us that would even partly off
set the abandonment of the Government's plant
in San Francisco Â«t the Presidio.
I have acked Congress for authority to give
Â¦up the transport* and make & contract with
a private company or companies for doing this
burners, but I hardly think the chanpe is one
ttiat is likely to take place immediately. Your
inquiry as to the effect it wil\ have upon San
Francisco business is one, however, which I
u answer in a. general way.
Secretary of War Root was Interviewed
yesterday at Washington in reference to
vhe matter, llis remarks are certainly
assuring and it at present looks as if San
Francisco will retain the military traifle.
yet a number of the commercial men of
San Francisco claim that the moment the
transportation of troops is let by contract
this city will lose the soldier trade. Sec
retary Root said:
Boot Favors San Francisco.

myself have been asked to po East at once. 1
am not poing- East especially in reference to
the transport contract, but I expect that I will

aC course if we could secure a big contract we
would accent it.

ber of Commerce met yesterday in execu
tive session with George A. Newhall as
chairman. Telegrams were sent to Wash
ington, asking- the California representa
tives to use ail means to induce the United
States Government to continue transport
ing troops under the direction of the War
Department and not by public contract.
Little help is expeered from Senator
George C. Perkins in this direction, as he
Is a prominent officer in the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company and this corporation
is not leaving a stone unturned in its ef
fort to secure the contract.
Charles M. Goodall in an interview yes
terday said:
To-day Charles M. Goodall of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company and President
James D. Farrell of the Pacific Coast
Company of Seattle will leave for the
Kast with the express purpose of usinsr
every influence toward getting Secretary
of War Root to grant them the contract
of transporting troops to and from the
Philippines.
What action Congress will take is a
momentous question. Influence will have
to be brought to bear at once by all com
mercial men of this city. Energetic steps
ure being taken by the business men of
Sound cities to secure the War De
partment contract for transporting troops.
Should the Government award this con
tract to a private company the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company would in all
probability secure it- James J. Hill is
assisting this company toward this end
and la'event of its success he would
carry ell soldiers over the Great Northern
road to end from the East and ship them
from Seattle.

. These are the facts as they stand to-day
and every person suffering from a respir-
atory, disease should learn the truth
about this new cure by writing to The R.
T. Booth Co., Ithaca, N. Y. t for a freo
sample' of HYOMEI, or If you haven't
time to do this, ask your druggist for a
HYOMEI outfit. It may save your life.
- Since . HYOMEI was discovered . the
death rate from consumption 13 shown to
have" decreased 33 per cent annually. It
has been indorsed by the United States
health reports and the medical profession
have declared II YOJI El to be the only
cure known for coughs, catarrh, pneu-
monia and consumption.
No reputable physician would acknowl-
edge that there was a cure for the dis-
ease, and the .United States health reports
never Â¦- even mentioned one of the thou-
sands of treatments used.
Until HYOMEI, the new dry-air germi-
cide, was discovered, deaths from con-
sumption increased over 22 per cent an-
nually. , . -Â¦;â¢*â¢â¢ Â¦-.
Thousands of weak lunged people who
through their ignorance Imagine that
consumption is hereditary and that there
are a Â¦ dozen and ono different remedies
which will cure it, go to their death beds
annually because of their ignorance as to
the true facts " and it Is high time they
were brought to a. realizing sense of their
danger. V-^-
Yet these are . the. exact facts in the
case. The number of people who die
annually from consumption alone average
one in every family of six In. the United
States, and medical records and Govern-
ment statistics show that not a single case
has been cured excepting by one treat-
ment.
If all weak lunged people were told tbat
their chances of escaping consumption
was only one In six and that after con-
tracting the disease there was but one
chance In ten thousand of their ever re-
covering unless they adopted a certain
treatment, what a â¢ sensation it would
create.

would not make "any appointment at pres

His present 'lntention.Vbe said, was not to
go outside the Custom-house for. the new
appointee, as he -considered, the position
filled by Clerk Jerome to be under, the
civil service "rules, and he wished to make

made all '-along' the 'line; >-^ / 'â¢-Â¦Â¦. <!->
.Although the Collector declined to say

matter, ' as those ; gentlemen might -wish
to be consulted regarding their â¢ friends

MAYOR IS HOST
AT A RECEPTION
The committee then directed the Board
of Works to immediately remove the can
opy and furniture in Judge Dunne's
courtroom to the Hall of Justice and place
the' courtroom he now occupies in posses
sion of the public library. Judge Dunne
grew .highly indignant and stalking out
of the committee room said that he would
see If the Supervisors could compel him
to vacate his chambers. Judge Cook
made a written demand that the com
mittee provide him with a suitable court
roonTin the City Hall even If the Hast
ings Law. College would have to be re
moved to do so. V Â¦ â¢
The application of Judge Cook to be
transferred from the Hallof Justice was
denied by the committee -on the ground
that the Legislature set aside the build
ing for the trial of criminal, cases by the
Superior Court. The committee decided
that it would only assign a courtroom to
Judge Cook if the other Superior Judge
removed tq the Hall of Justice.
Judge? Cook said that he proposed to
assign criminal cases to departments In
the City Hall In the future.
Presiding Judge Cook appeared before
the Building; Committee yesterday and
demanded .that quarters be assigned to.
him in the City. Hall. The committee re
quested that Judge Cook exchange calen
dars with Judge Graham, so that each
would take the other's chambers, but this
Judge Cook refused to do.
Judge Dunne appeared and expressed
his willingness to move to the Hall of
Justice provided that ample accommoda
tions are provided for him. He said that
he intended to remain in the City Hall
and try all cases assigned. to him despite
the objections of the Supervisors."
There is a serious clash between Supe
rior Judges Cook and Dunne and the
Board of Supervisors over an attempt to
compel the former to move the criminal
departments of the Superior Court to the
Hair of Justice.
THE social event of last Â¦ evening
was the First Friday cotillon, a
special midwinter assembly and
german at Golden Gate Halj.
about one hundred couples were
present. The feature, perhaps, was the
splendid music. ' Only choice selections
were rendered, and the conspicuous ab
sence of "ragtime" was truly pleasing.

The appointment was made on the
recommendation of Attorney General
Tirey L. Ford, who requested that he bo
allowed to appoint Attorney Short to this
position for the cases that will soon come
up. Of the five cases one is the Fresno
rate case in the Superior Court, two are
Bakersfield oil rate cases in the Superior
Court and the two others are oil rate

Short to Represent Commission
Chief Wittman asked the Commissioners
to ratify his action in engaging Commis
sioner Hutton to represent the board in
the Circuit Court. The action was in
dorsed.
Policeman Henry Helntz was tried for
disobedience of orders, given by a health
official. Chief Wlttman, Captain Splllane
and Sergeant Wolff highly praised Heintz.
and after deliberation the Commissioners
postponed action for one week.
A communication was received from
Charles W. Fay. clerk of the Board of
Supervisors, notifying the Commissioners
that all demands for supplies must be
marked "contract" or .".non-contract,"
otherwise the Finance Committee would
reject them.
Police Officer Harry Hook applied to be
reinstated as sergeant. In his applica
tion Hook showed that he had been ap
pointed a police officer April 23, 1S78; that
on October 1. 18S9, he was appointed ser
geant, and that September 23, 1S90, he was
disrated without trial. The matter was
referred to the City and County Attorney
for an opinion.
Hutton's first official act was to move
the postponement of the election of the
president of the board for the ensuing

TJnlted States Court Commissioner Hea
cock will take evidence at 2 o'clock this
afternoon in the celebrated case of the
Interstate Commission against the South
ern Pacific and the Union Pacific railroad
companies. L. A. Shaver, who has been
sent out here from the Attorney Gene
ral's office at Washington to represent
the commission on the trial of the case,
vill be present at the hearing.
The suit was brought in the United
States Circuit Court on July 10, 1900. The
complaint recites that during the hearing
before the commission of the petition of
A. J. Gustln on May 1 and 2. 1S95. it was
made to appear to the satisfaction of the
commission that the defendants had vio
lated the act to regulate commerce. ai>
proved February 4. 1887. in that they
charged a rate of 77 cents per WO pounds
on sugar in carloads for 'the haul from
San Francisco and other Pacific Coast
common points over their joint through
lines to Kearney, Nebraska, while at the
same time charging a rate of 50 cents
from Kearney to Omaha, and -that a rate
on such shipments to Kearney, which ex
ceeds by more than 15 cents per 100
pounds the rate contemporaneously
charged to Omaha, is wrongful, unjust
and unlawful, being in violation of sec
tion 3 of the act mentioned. The. com

Baltimore syndicate (has been effected.
Leon O. Fisher, expert. of the purchasing
syndicate, is in the city and will- remain
here or hereabouts' until a: consolidation
of all the lines v Into one syndicate under
one management has been accomplished.
Close and exact figuring may be re
quired to ascertain what representation
or ratio i each road t will be entitled to in
the consolidated system. Mileage, equip
ment, cost and profit j earning record
of- each road must be considered in tie
adjustment. The expert Is not here to
reopen or review negotiations, but simply
to hasten the work of merging all the
recently acquired street railways of San
Francisco into one system.- He will re
main here until the actual transfer of tlje
Market-street^railroad to the syndicate is
accomplished. It is calculated that-*this
transfer will take place early in ApriL < â¢
It is not denied that the capitalists and
promoters connected with the purchasing
syndicate may borrow money in New
York to pay for the properties recently
bought, and may even borrow money to
extend certain lines, and add to the en
tire system the best of modern equip
ment. . Arrangements may be made with
J. Plerpont Morgan, the Brown Bros, or
other financial agents to negotiate for the
salo of bonds Issued by the syndicate.
â¢ Reports come from the East that Brown
Bros., well known financiers, are supply
ing the funds. This does not signify that
the Browns have or will have a controll
ing influence In the management of the
system. As financial agents they will re
ceive the- customary percentage tor con
verting negotiable securities into coin or
currency to enable" the syndioate- to meet

tion of the properties.

Â¦"â¢Testimony for the Defense Given in
the Case Â¦ of â¢ Mrs. Reeves-
Atkinson.
" The hearing of witnesses for the defense
in the case of Mrs. Reeves- Atkinson,
charged with maintaining . a nuisance at
1815 .Sutter street in the shape of a pri
vate' sanitarium, was resumed before
Judge Fritz yesterday afternoon.
I Mrs. Clara Wadsworth, a daughter of
the defendant, testified that there never
were any unusual noises, the only excep
tion being In the case of Mrs. Alma Keith,
who 'testified for the prosecution. The
witness said that when she went into the
yard the neighbors, thinking she was a
patient, would always laugh and jeer at
her. The cries of "Amelia," told of by a
witness for the prosecution, came from a
parrot in Mrs. Guggenheim's house, ad
joining the sanitarium. She denied that
the Morgue wagon ever called at the san
itarium, and said it was always quiet.
One policeman had been a patient, but she
did not know his name.
Dr. Himmelsbach testified .that he at
tended Mrs. Keith at the sanitarium night
and day, and never heard any unusual
noise'. One time Mrs. Keith attacked him
with a- bottle in each hand, and ha had to
grapple with her to protect himself. They
fell together to the floor and some attend
ants came to his assistance. Mrs. Keith
always told him the defendant was the
best friend she ever had.
I Drs. O. Mansfield and J. J. Keith also
testified that they had attended patients
night -and day at the sanitarium, and had
never seen or -heard anything unusual.
The case will be resumed to-morrow.
