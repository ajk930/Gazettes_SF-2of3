The Real Water Problem:
It takes a great" deal to scare the people of
San Francisco. A , gentleman said to me .the
other day that ; If war were declared against
the United States' and' a .hostile ., fleet' 'were
threatening | San Francisco our Â¦{ people, would
Â¦not believe. they were In danger till the bombs
were crashing thrqugh the roofs Â¦'; of , ' their
dwellings. 'No greater calamity than a;scar
city ; of water can face , any- people, , yet * it has
only " ; been recently that the question of a' water
famine ' could' Interest our people. . They are,
however, waking; lip. .The San: Francisco Call
is one of the organs of conservatism. No one
can charge It' with being a supporter of muni
cipal ownership,^ yet on the 10th of last De
cember It had the following, 'editorial: Â¦ '
From which the Inference is plain that an
other dry year, will be disastrous^ We are near
ly ' six ; inches short 'or ram this year as com
pared with 'last year. Â¦
Chief Engineer. Schussler also said:/ "I. said

J, Annie Anderson, believing I am now about
to die, make this, my dying statement. I came
from .the! Swedish church on : Jessie street. I
bade , my sister " farewell and ' I , started "to go
home/., 1 1 took â¢ the car near Sixth street and I
sat on the car until I came to Ashbury street.
I had. gone a few steps when a man came and
took hold of me and then he shot me and I
cried and Â«peoplfe cams and he ran away. Ha
had a mask on .his. face: be had. a rain coat on
and the; cape "hid his face. .1 couldn't see him
.very 'good,; if was all done Â¦ so quietly. Thl*
happened at : 0 UtO p. m.. " February - 16. " 1DO2.
.There .were no others on the, car that I saw.
except^the conductor, arid the man that steers : .
the ; car. ? : ; I - think it was one of Â¦ them , on t the
car that sho< me, for he waa shooting > whila 1
vii to tbi'car. i - \ _>.
When the wounded woman' arrived at
the hospital Detective- Dinan Immediately
telephoned for Policeman Xelson to act
as interpreter â¢ for Assistant District At
torney â¢ John J."' Greeley, who was thera
to take the dying "woman's statement. It
was as follows:
, v; . The Â¦ excited man "who boarded the Mc-
Allister-street car an " hour and a half
after the shooting did not wear an over
coat* of any kind. He was ' described as
being 5'feet ? inches In height; dressed in
black, with a derby hat and dark brown
mustache.
Both are positive there was not a fourth
person on the car.. Chief Wittman and
Captain Seymour,. after interviewing both
gripman J and conductor, were "completely
satisfied that i neither were Implicated in
any'way'with the murderous assault.
They were utterly surprised at the news
of the shooting. They 'returned from' the
trip to the park at 10 o'clock and went
home, and at that time nothing was
known at the power-house of the occur
rence.
.', Both C.L. Jones, the gripman, and Con
ductor Wyatt state that . they heard no
shots in the locality after the woman left
the car,.' '
, John Wyatt, conductor, on car No. 207 of
the Hayes-street line, saj-3 that a woman
with a. light colored coat and straw hat
andj black veil, which answers- the de
scription of the wearing apparel cf the
wounded woman, got o.i nia car at the
ferry and got off at Ashbury and Hayes
streets about 9:45 p. m. He noticed her,
particularly, because she was the only
passenger beyond the .Haycs-ctreet pbweri
Mystery Shrouds Case.
The woman's positive statements and
the seemingly rational way in which she
described the shooting in every particular,
save that portion of it in which she casts
suspicion upon the conductor, involves the
case in a tangled skein of mystery, which
the police may have a hard task unravel
ing, t .
The conductor and gripman state posi
tively that tney heard no shots, and the
people in the neighborhood bear out their
stories. Several gentlemen -who live in
toe vicinity of the shooting say that only
one shot was fired. The bullet was flred
at close- range. It burned a- hole In the
white coat which she wore and left pow
der marks for fully four or five inches
around the spot where the bullet entered.
San Francisco's dependence for water is al
most entirely upon the Spring Valley Water
Works. The Visltadon Water Company sup
plies 517 consumers and is the only rival of the
monopoly. The sources of water of the Spring
Valley Water Works are three â Lake Merced,
â¢ the peniniula reservoirs and Alameda Creek.
Lake Merced Is a foj-mer arm of the ocean,
into which drains the rain water O ( f several
thousand acres of land, some of it thickly in
fcfib'.ted. The three perdnso 1 * reservoir* are
eltuated in the hills of San, Mateo County.
They are magnificent reservoir siteE. but have
very fmall catchment areas. When full they
contain a. three year's (supply of. water for San
Frsncieco. These reservoirs . were once the
main supply of the Spring Valley Water
Works, but the lirht rainfall of .the past five
years has compelled 11 to \ develop \ to the ut
taort the water-bearing properties of Alameda
Creek. Alaraeda Creek has a very large' draln
aee area, but no reservoir eites â at least, none
untilized. The flood waters of winter run"! into .
the ocean without hindrance. In order to make ,
use of a portion of this water Chief Kng-ineer
Â£cfcurÂ«0er has developed a sort of: underground
reservoir in the gravel beds Just above Sunol,
and by a system o f underground â¢ tunnels ob
tains a constant supply" of over eight million
gallons per day. From these various, source*
about 26,000,000 gallons a day are * secured.
MoFt of the water Is good, but 'some 'of'- It' is
b&d. and retting worse.

Â¦Â¦ X-SUPERVISOR Charles Wesley
Reed delivered an address last
Â¦^ evening at the Academy of Sci
ences building on the subject of
- 1 <*f "Ban Francisco's Water Supply"
before a large audience, which
frequently cheered his remarks.
The speaker was listened to with close
attention, and his caustic criticisms of
the Board of Public Works, the Spring
Valley Water Company and the Bulletin
were greeted with applause.
At the close of . the address some of
those who had listened to the arraign
ment of a portion of the city's govern
ment, the water company and the Bulle
tin asked pertinent questions of^ the
speaker of the evening, who furnished the
Information desired.
A \ vote of thanks was unanimously
given to the ex-Supervisor and he was
personally congratulated by the majority
cf Mie citizens present at the meeting.
In dealing with the subject of the city's
supply of water ex-Supervisor Reed said:
The constitution of California provides that
in the month of February or ' each year the
legislative body of each municipality shall es
tablish the "rates of compensation to be col
lected for the use of water supplied to any city
and county, or city or town, or the inhabit
ar.tt thereof." All over the State the man^iite
of article XIV cf the constitution is now "jsing
complied with. A discussion of San Fran
cisco"6 water question is therefore timely, and
in my humble opinion Is of great importance.

The theory of the -police at : an early

.Neither of the men knew of the.shoot

to ; believe that the' woman was so badly

structed on Â» wronÂ« principle. Its projectors
believed that sufficient rain water I could be.
caught and stored In the San Mateo Mountains
for the needs of San Francisco for .' years to
come. But they made a sad mistake. Millions
of dollars have been spent on the peninsula
reservoirs, yet for the last five years they have
yielded practically no nÂ«w, water. Five years
agro the reservoirs were full, . now they are
about one-sixth full. The lessened rainfall of,
the last five years has been a severe blow to
the agricultural regions of the. State, but* even '
more to the Spring Valley Water Works. That
company Is compelled . to draw 'on the stored
water of the peninsula reservoirs to a greater
extent # than the inflow, while its other sources
of supply are not sufficient for the .present'
needs of San. Francisco, let alone Its' future'
necessities. The water company Is like a man
who has money In bank and . a small j Income
from his business, but whose expenses are
theater than this income. He has to draw
on the bank to keep going, and the question
Is, How long will it be before he Is bankrupt?
In like manner, the Spring \ Valley ; Water
Works has been drawing on the peninsula res
ervoirs for five years, and its capltal-f-for wa
ter is Us capitalâ has been gradually lessened. .
The company has been making great efforts
In the meantime to stay the drain on its stored
water by increasing its. supply' from other
sources. It has spent, and is spending, mil
lions in Alameda; it "has r-wntly been using
the polluted water of * Lobos Creek, poisoned
with the drainage/from sewers, hospitc'is , and
graveyards, but was compelled to stop by the?
last Board of Supervisors; and it is'now build-,

Our hope is -In Mayor Schmitz. His public

have Its own water supply. He also believes
that public , servants should earn their salaries
and -that public work ; should be performed
Bpeedll" l and well. Â« Let us hope that he will
find his way clear, to exercise the power that
the charter places ; in his hands : and removes
the two Commf ssionera of Public Works who
are . rsponslble for the delays in Â¦ public work
and for the complexity of affairs in the depart

plain, : . practical, earnest and faithful .' men , in

become what .the; charter framera Intend It to

When we examine the preliminary work of the
Board of Public Works we find that they have
raised the figures- of- their own subordinates
by $10,000,000: that . they -have planned the
most costly and difficult system to be Imagined;
that they have . refused Â¦ to accept suggestions
from other engineers, and altogether* have con
ducted themselves in ' a way to excite opposi
tion and lack Â¦ of confidence and induced the
charge of incompetence, which is bruited about
on every hand. '

atory.- work of tha Bureau .of '. Â¦ engineering.
That finely. organized xtepartment: has been flu
able Â¦ to ". make plans -for -the connection "of "a
side "sewer with the main sewer within three
months after the application had been made.
But the dwadling characteristics of this body
of engineers is -most clearly shown In the In
excusable delay In making the plans and esti
mates of the cost of the various public utilities
as required by the charter. The charter pro
vides in article xii, section l; that v within one
year from January 8.' 15)00. plans and estimates
of the actual cost of the original construction
and completion by the city and county of water
works and the various other public utilities
therein . named. More than - two years have
passed and still the mandate of ' the charter
has not been complied with. The City En
gineer promised to the Supervisors to com
plete the plans for the water works long ago.
He - promised . that all the .plans should be in
by November, and again, that -all should be
in before the end of the year, but- still the
work is 'incomplete. In the meantime, Claus
Spreckels haa decided to huild a gas plant. haÂ«

expressed their disapproval of it?, muddy water,'
based oh personal Inspection.. Â¦' r Â¦ " Â¦ .
A remedy was proposed at the last bession
of the Legislature by a constitutional amend-
BXf the Board of Supervisors ,1s true to the
people, their acts are rendered nugatory by the
dilatory tactics of the water company.. If they
betray the people, a higher rate Is fixed than
is right, which enables the company to issue
more watered stock. This is disposed of to
innocent purchasers, and when an honest in
quiry is again set on foot, the company's
agents eay "Protect our stock and bonds."
But where has the money gone from the sale
of these bonds and stock? We know that
the Spring Valley Water Works is overcapi
talized by millions of dollars, but if every
Board of Supervisors was to expert the books
and operations of the Spring Valley Water
Works they would hardly have time to attend
to any other business. So I cay that the only
remedy for the high charges, the overcapitali
zation and the corrupt practices of the Spring
Valley Water Works, *ls municipal ownership.
Proposed ConstitutionarAmendment.
But if they decide, out of the maze of per
plexing data hurled at their devoted I heads, that
the people are being robbed and proceed to paps
an ordinance lowering rates, the water com
pany sues out an injunction and keeps the suit
alive until a new and more subservient board
is elected to office. That was the course pur
sued by the Contra Costa -Water Company over
in Oakland, and will be the Â¦ course of the
Spring Valley Water Works in case the present
Board of Supervisors follows in the steps of
the last board. Even now the company has a
suit in the United States Circuit Court to
nullify the last water ordinance. - ..
Overcapitalised by Millions.
The public control of public utilities is a
failure. Observe it in operation in fixing water
rates. Every two years a new Board of Super
visors wrestles with the water question, and
its members are pitted against the veteran
Schussler. That wily diplomat cajoles, flatters,
threatens, bluffs â is all things to all Super
visors that some votes for the water company
may be saved. The Supervisors are wearied
with figures on depreciation and appreciation.
on land values and water rights, on the coet
at operation and duplication, and the Lord
knows what. . .
Moral Delinquencies Worst.
Passing from a consideration of the physical
shortcomings of Â¦ the Spring Valley .Waier
Works to its moral delinquencies, we find the
latter most pronounced. The Spring Valley
Water Works is a private company. Its busi
ness is to get the most out of the people of
tian Francisco for the least return. During the
torty odd years of its existence it has been
tbe chief malefactor in corrupting tbe public
service of San Francisco. During the past two
years the weighty arguments which it has
been accustomed to use have not been of avail,
not because of any qualms of conscience on the
part of its managers, but because the Super
visors have In very truth been the representa
tives of the people. The Spring Valley Water
Works has always been, and, as long as it
continues a power hi this community, will be,
ready to pay money for higher rates than it
it entitled to receive. It has lpng been the
habit of the people to judge of the character
of the lioard of Supervisors by the vote on the
water ordinance in February after they enter
office. I trust that the present board will be
true to the people, but there stand the emis
saries of the Spring Valley Water Works
tempting them to forsake the path of recti
tude, offering more for a favorable vote than
the (salary of a Supervisor for his entire term
of office. We are taught to pray that tempta
tion be removed from us, but if the Super
visors of San Francisco be not led into tempta
tion, the power of the Spring Valley Water
Works must be broken, and that can only be
by public ownership of our water supply.
euli will be free enough from human habita
tion and the resulting refuse of its springs and
i-i reams to furnish water tit for household pur
poses."
And again on December 31. The Call said:
â¢'It is well known that during the last two
j-c-ars the Spring Valley Company has been
tevcrlly strained to meet the usual demands
upon it. The reservoirs in Ban Mateo County
are now at a very low point, the lowest for
years, and another dry winter will tax the
powers of tbe company to its utmost. These
lacts are published because every resident ol
the city U vitally interested in this water
Â«;uestion."
The Uistributlng system of the Spring Valley
Water Work* is very bad. The chief engineer
r,i the Fire Department testified last year be
lore the Board of Supervisors that many of
the mains were too small to carry water rap
idly enough in case of large fires -in the city:
that if two large fires should ever occur af
tiie same time, many of the flre engines would
be obliged to stand idly by, unable to pump
water because of the insufficient sire of the
mains eupplyfhg water to the fire hydrants.

ownership of a water supply to San Francisco,
what water supply will we choose to acquire?
Can we afford to buy the Sprlngi Valley Water
Works? There is no doubt that that company
has splendid reservoir sites and has control
of - all the : nearby sources of ' supply, yet . the
city should not think of dealing with the Spring
Valley Water Works. Not only Is it overcapi
talized beyond reason, but its supply is made-:
quate not only for the distant future;* but for'
our, immediate needs. Â¦ We must â¢ go Â¦ to .the

has always publicly owned ; its . own : water eup- ,

in New York the cost of water, is seven times
cheaper than In San Francisco. Furthermore,
the New Tork system. -is a fertile source of
revenue for the Government.; After paying op

charges of the water system New Tork City de
rives a large revenue to be applied l to the or

The reasons for this' are not hard to see. Thi'
private corporations In the â¢ United States . thar
manage our public utilities as a rule have not
a dollar Invested by their promoters. The ma
nipulators of these corporations manage to.is
sue watered stock and bonds to the extent of
millions of dollars. The ; people ' have to â¢ pay
enough for the services rendered to make ; a
handsome return not only upon the real money
invested, but upon the fictitious values aa
well. That is why charges y are high in the
private corporations.' .; .Â¦ 'â¢ ",'-.;-
I was able to show, during the water investi

Valley Water Works, and the testimony of- its
own witnesses, that of the/ $26,777,000 of its
stocks and bonds upon which the city was pay-'
ing interest $4,303,701 80 - was fictitious . and
that only $22,411,2Â»8 20 was actually paid into
the treasury of the company. .1 also was. able
to. show, that the .Â¦cost of the property that was
actually being, used in supplying the city .with
water wagf $16,303,715 88. That corporation
is now suinarthe courts to obtain a valuation
of $35,000,000 for its property.; Is it any won
der that the, charges of the Spring Valley
ter Works are high when it is carrying such a
load of. fictitious values?-' Or is it any wonder
that the public ownership of : our' water supply
would result In lower rates? "Â¦Â¦ 1

- The advocates . of municipal Â¦ ' ownership of

What all other- American cities are doing ts
surely wise for us to. do. ; Â¦ ''Â¦Â¦"',
"At the close of 1806 there were in the
United States 3196 waterworks. Of these 1C.SK>
were -under public control. 1480 under . private
control, 12 were under 'Joint control and of 5
the ownership was .unknown: In other words.
Ill 1800 6.3. per cent were Â¦ public. : 93.7 per. cent
were private. . In 1896 53.2 per cent were -pub
lic. 4<?.8 per cent were private." - 1.
"The . Water Supply of the . City of ; New
Tork." Published by the Merchants' Associa
tion of New Tork, page 20. . . Â£*?MEaBEMagMi
"In 1800 there were sixteen plants- In opera
tion Jn the United States, of. which fifteen were
private aijfl one public. . Since that time four
teen of the. fifteen have become public.
In this regard the Merchants' Association of
New Tork says: "The experience of other mu
nicipalities in the United States as well as in
other countries -- shows an almost ; continuous
tendency to substitute publicly owned wate'f
systems j for' private, a tendency / so persistent
and so universal and of . such j constantly in
creasing force, that the, wisdom, â¢ In the pub-'
lie Interest, of the policy, of municipal; owner
ship and control of water , supply would seem
established by abundant '- experience. - ' ' Â¦Â¦":Â¦:
The ownership of water supplies by cities is
justified by an appeal to experience and morals
â by business as well as. political principles.
If we - look to the experience of other cities
we find that of the fifty ' largest cities in the
United States only nine have water works un
der private control. cities are San Fran.
Cisco. New Orleans, Omaha. Denver, Indiana
polls," New Haven. " Paterson. ' Scranton - and
Memphis. Forty-one to nine is the judgment
of the American people in our largest munici
palities in favor of public ownership of water.
Municipal Ownership.
5. Â¦ Highly Improved property and large
stocks of goods which are protected from de
struction by our flre department pay. no ade
quate water tax. . . v
I believe that there never. was a flner<exam
ple of unequal charges and unequal rights than
is furnished by our water ordinances. Hardly
any two citizens pay, at the same rate for the
same service. " and the : classifications are , not
based on any. principle. Municipal ownership
would place . the burden on all equally, and it
is the only ' effective remedy. ,
4. Vacant' lands pay no . water tax. ' If it
were not for the fact that, water caa be had.
unimproved city property would have little
value. The presence of water in the streets
gives unimproved property a large part of its
value, and such property should contribute to
the cost of maintaining a water system.
3. If the water company overcharges under
the flat rate, no' private consumer has the
right to a meter, but if the water company has
a dispute with a private consumer, it can put
in a meter whether the private consumer likes
it or not. . . . , â¢ ' -
2. - Meter rates are fixed so that the - small
consumer pays nearly double what the large
consumer does. What would you think ot a
gas ordinance that fixed tbe rate for the small
consumer at ' t -' a thousand feet and for the
large -consumer $1 a thousand?. Such commod
ities as light and water, are supposed to be
furnished at a uniform- rate, yet the meter
rates for water are for -the smallest consumer
25 cents for 100 cubic feet, -.while for' tiie
large consumer it is 12 cents for the same
quantity.' The Market Street Railway Com
pany gets water for less than one-half what
is charged the small householder. Â¦."Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ '-
If the Supervisors pass a lower rate the
company can increase its charges to meet tbe
cut. - Â¦ Â¦ . â¢ . ..
1, The ordinance has a section (section â¢ S)
which allows the water company to fix the
rates for stores, hotels, lodging-houses, etc.,
according to the estimated quantity used. The
company has the sole right of estimation, and
can raise rates at will within - the â¢ limitation
named.
Before passing to the subject of municipal
ownership I would like to point out and -. em
phasize some of the shortcomings ot the pres
ent water ordinance, -which follows the torir.s
in use ' for years â¢ past : .

Prince Henry had been made fast. At 1

The dead man was a son of William

six years ago, and whose two murderers
were lynched at Yreka In September, 1896.
Mrs. Gainy went from Henley to Kla

night. She 'was -only 20 years -old and
came of a good family. Her father lives
at Talent, Or. The girl's husband, . Wil

is now at Medford, Or. â¢
Undoubtedly both Sears and Rhodes
were in love Â¦ with Mrs. Gainy. The offlv
cers who are at work upon the case es
pouse Rhodes' cause and say the real
slayer of Sears is yet to be caught. They,
believe the shooting was the result ~ of
Jealousy. ' :. - . ,-.'Â¦..
When the. killing occurred . Sears,
Rhodes, Mrs. Gainy and another woman
and the barkeeper were the only persons
present. Mrs. Gainy shot herself without
assigning any reason, and the only wit
nesses now are the other woman and the
barkeeper. It is thought some entirely
new solution of the murder must be
found. There was a quarrel, but the fatal
shot may have come = from a source not
yet brought to light. Rhodes will 'be as
sisted to make a strong defense. . :

Artell Greenwood was a natural horse
man and his schoolmates gave him' the
name of "Artello, -the Vaquero." At his
father's death he and his sister cot but
$50 each of his estate and went back to
their mother in San Francisco.
Joseph Greenwood had relatives in Eng
land. After his death his unfortunate fam
ily affairs could not be followed by the rel
atives. Recently one of them died, leaving
a. good-sized fortune. A photograph,
marked '"Artello Greenwood" was found"
in the dead man's effects. It was taken
at the gallery of L. Cramer. San Francis-.
The story is of a poor fellow whose love
for horses led him to become a coachman,
and who may now have coaches and
horses galore of . his own. Artell Green
wood was reared in Redding. He and his
sister, Hattie, were, children of Joseph
Greenwood; . a I pioneer shoemaker, who
disagreed with his wife in San Francisco
and taking his children came here to live.
He married again and accumulated cor
ner lots in the business center. Fearing
his former wife might claim a share, he
deeded his lots to his second wife before
his death in August, 1S98, and the lots
have since become very valuable.

MANILA, Feb. 16.â General J. Franklin
Bell has practically checked the insurrec

der his command having made a clean
sweep of the district. It Is not believed
that all the insurgent arms have been
captured or surrendered. ; It is believed
that a number of them have been taken
by the insurgents to other provinces or
safely a hidden. The increase of robber
bands in the provinces of Tayabas and
Cavlte show the effects j of the drastic
measures adopted in Batangaa and La
guna Provinces. General Bell says the
people of these latter provinces never
realized the. terrors of war until they per
sonally experienced its hardships, owing
to the closing of the ports and the con
centration of the natives in the towns.

W.;' WASHINGTON, Â¦ Feb.: 16.âConsider
able concern is expressed in administra
tion, circles over the lefusal of Germany
to evacuate .Tientsin, as recently request
ed ' by , the Chinese Government.
â¢Great Britain/Japan and Germany have
troops ; stationed in Tientsin, and China
suggested that the time had arrived when
they could be safely withdrawn. Russia,
France and the United States have long
ago 'removed their- troops from^*the pro
vince of Chili. Great Britain and Japan
were Â¦ willing â¢ to order their detachments
home, but Germany declined to take this
action. Her ostensible reason is that their
presence will facilitate the satisfaction by
China. of the demands, made by the'pow-'
era upon the Imperial Government. \
v It ; is Â¦ not understood that this Govern
ment will at this moment make any rep
resentations to Germany looking to com
pliance with the ; Chinese . request. . Too
frequent, interference with the action of
the I powers Â¦ may make enemies without
producing, results. Thus it is pointed out
that* if- the -United States were to apply
pressure to Germany the effect would be
to drive that Government into the arms
of Russia and lead those two nations and
France to take an identical weapon . for
the protection of their like, interests.
Â¦ As it "is, continental Europe is looking
with some distrust upon the United States
for its action : in connection with the
Russo-Chinese Bank incident,- If the
United" States objects . to the -granting of
concessions to a semi-Chinese institution
it is appreciated by Â¦ Europe that it will
protest against the granting of exclusive
concessions to syndicates which are whol
ly foreign, and this may lead to common
action, r Secretary Hay has.no desire to
force such a step as this, and the admin
istration is satisfied that he will play the
diplomatic game shrewdly so as;to pre
vent such a strong combination being ef
fected: .: - ; - â¢-Â¦-Â¦/ ;.-:Â¦; ., ' - : Â¦
Both China and Korea are gratified at
the : conclusion of. the Anglo -Japanese
treaty â China because it has always been
her policy to keep the powers at logger
heads; Korea because she hopes that the
more the powers guarantee her independ
ence the safer wUl be her autonomy.
From' all -that can be learned Russia is
quite content that Great Britain should
have incorporated in the treaty with Ja
pan a provision for the independence and
integrity of Korea, as she. has been ap
prehensive that it was. the policy of Japan
to extend her sovereignty oven that'king
dom. Russia will certainly not allow Ja
pan on the mainland, and if Japanese
troops are landed on the . Korean penin

at the foot of the woman were a number
of letters. . -
Cole was mortally wounded and died be
fore a physician could be- summoned. He
had shot himself through the head.
* Mrs. Cole is a young and handsome
woman. The theory . is that the husband
found some correspondence belonging 1 to
his wife, that there was a quarrel and
then the tragedy.
Harold M. Cole was one of the prominent
mining men of the State. In addition to
being assistant superintendent at -the
East Helena smelter he was chief chemist

with the East Helena concern. Cole was
34 years old. He leaves relatives In Jersey

The correspondent asserts that the revo

first Aceval consented, but afterward be
declined to carry out his promise. This
was followed by a heated discussion in
the Congress, during which one of the
members discharged a revolver.
This was the signal for a fusilade on
all sides. Members took shelter behind
the desks and chairs, and a fierce batlla
was waged until a strong body of mili
tary arrived with two machine guns,
which the soldiers threatened to turn on
the combatants if the firing did not ceasa.
At the close of the hostilities Dr. Ina

riddled Â¦with bullets. Many other mem
bers were severely wounded, some It is

lishes a letter received from Its corre
spondent, M. Rouyer, a survivor | of the
massacre of a French scientific mission
by cannibals at Slleraka, New Guinea, on
January L M. Rouyer relates that the
yacht Salvattl with the mission on board
had anchored off the coast of New Guinea
and that several of the explorers landed.
After an apparently friendly reception
from the natives the latter treacherously
attacked them during the night, murder
ing twenty-five of the party, including
Baron Vlllars, Count de St. Romy ~and
MM. Hagenbock and Vries, and wounding
thirty-three, Including the writer of the
letter, M. Rouyer, the chief of the mis
sion, and another -Frenchman named
Reimer. M. Rouyer writes: - '
We were all sleeping peacefully when there
Mas a great . uproar and we were attacked : by
hundreds of natives carrying torches. Several
of us were felled to the ground with clubs,
hatchets and epears. Others "were overpow
ered, carried away and bound to trees. I was
â¢among this number. I received a blow on the
head from a club and fainted. When I re
covered consciousness at 5 o'clock In the morn
ing I found myself tied hand- and foot and
surrounded by savages, who, believing me tj
be dead, were keeping me for themselves.
I saw the body of Baron Vlllars near me,
bound to a tree. His body was naked, his
head had been split open, his eyes had been
gouged out and he ' wae otherwise horribly
mutilated. The Count de Saint Romy had been
decapitated and his head stuck on the end of
a spear, as a trophy.
M. Hagenbock was spitted on a bamboo and
Â¦was being roasted over a flre. The savages
â¢were about to cut htm up.
I waited my fate. I vras afraid to move.
My head hurt me dreadfully. All around me
the ground was strewn with corpses.
Suddenly a great clamor arose, followed by
a fusillade. I opened my eyes and saw Dr.
Foriter and the remainder of the mission from
the yacht firing on the cannibals. I shouted
and the rescuers ran. to me and cut the bonds
which bound me to the tree. The cannibals
fled, leaving thirty-two dead. The clothes of
M. Vries were found, but his body was miss
ing. He had evidently been devoured by the
savages during the night.

The chief objection, to the measure is. that the bili
collects into the new department a miscellaneous
lot of bureaus which have no relation to. one another 1
and ought not to be' combined in one department
The Call directed attention to that fact at the time
of the -passage of the bill, and "pointed out "the ab
surdity of the arrangement. , It now . appears from ;
the discussion which- has arisen . over the question
that the distribution of bureaus among the, govern
mental departments is a matter requiring considera
ble study.' Some bureaus' are .closely related to the
work of several departments, and it is a' nice question
to decide to which, they shall; be /assigned. .Then
there, are. other bureaus .whose work to some extent
covers the same ground, and whije they are in difler
ent departments there; is more or--: less interference
with oneanother. The result has been a good deal
o'f . duplication of service in certain directions, -with
inadequate; service in cithers.' '')\'
Another unsatisfactory feature of the present situ
ation; is the uneyenness with which the .bureaus are
di\-ided. Thus the Boston Transcript points' out that
Secretary Shaw has under his control in Washington
nearly -5000 employes, and Secretary /Hitchcock" hasi
DESPITE the readiness with which the bill
creating a Department of Commerce and
Industry passed th'e Senate, some of the
best informed correspondents at Washington believe
it will be subjected to considerable revision before ; it
is finally enacted into law. It is stated that at the
time the bill was passed three of the most influential
Senators, Allison, Aldrich and Platt of Connecticut
were absent, and that they are not wholly pleased
with it. One report says: "No one can. scan -the
proceedings of the Senate over this bill without
reading between the lines a purpose to get it over to
the House and to rely on its return trip to the Senate
for further study, or perhaps on- the conference com
mittee'for the shape it. shall ultimately take." / v,Â«V/

Adelina ' Patti, ; whose career; on the stage is as/re
markable .forvits' length yas'ifor its â¢brilliancy, is re-, :

eight ' hours of sleep every ni^ht, and takes that in . a

* -There- is vast difference in cost of shipbuilding in French
dockyards, unparalleled in any other navy." which can only be
. explained as being due to more or less efficient "supervision.
The ' comparative cost as given by the Minister of Marina
, shows: .Rochefort, leading- with $850 per ton; Cherbourg S59S-
Toulon,.$402 50; L'Orient, $420 25, and Brest -with $403 25. These
charges include only general expenses, and the corresponding
cost of work done in private yards for the navy averae-A
$372 50 per ton. Adding the amount due for interest. deterlor^T
tion. renewal of plant and taxes which private builders have
to meet, the cost amounts to $465 50, which is stiU CorwWeVahlv
less than In three of the Government yards. â¢ --.

The Navy Department has wisely receded from Its' first in
tention of continuing Rear Admiral Cromwell in command on
the European station after that officer's retirement on Feb
ruary '3 on account of age. It would have been an unprece-^ *
dented innovation on the rights of other officers, and the re
cent act of Congress . permitting the employment, of retired
officers on active- duty was only intended to cover shore/serv
ice. Of the twenty- two rear admirals there are twelve who
have not yet served at sea In that grade, and one has only two
months* sea service to hia credit. Fifteen were performing 1
shore duty on January \, of which ten were at navy yards and
naval stations and one was waiting orders. No- . distinction la
made in the command of navy yards, as was hitherto the cus
tom, and as it Is practiced in foreign navies, for such an
insignificant yard as Pensacola has a rear admiral, and the
naval station at Port Royal,- which has been abandoned
for all purposes as such. Is also honored with a rear
admiral -as commandant, and thus placed on a level with New-
York. -Norfolk and Mare Island. ..? :
fleet that, is being assembled to receive Prince-Henry of Prus
sia. .The vessel Is now a training ship for engineers and fire
men, and her sister ship, the Raleigh, which ia also being re
built, is to be, utilized for the same purpose. The Cincinnati
was built In 1890-94 and went into commission June 16, 1S94, and
is therefore- barely eight years old. She is rated a3 a 19-knot
cruiser, but during the Cuban trouble preceding the Spanish-
American war the cruiser 1 failed to overtake filibuster steamer3
such as the Dauntless, the maximum speed of which did not
exceed 14 knots.'. The first cost of the Cincinnati was $2,371,905.
and' the total cost of repairs and alterations up to the -present
time Is very close to one million dollars. The two ships are of
a type/that will not be "duplicated, and they are -more suitable

In .California the conditions < continue to improve
and the prospects for a fine year are brilliant. The
rains appeared late, but th^y have been making up
for lost time in the 'Central and northern 'portions,
which have now received ample moisture to insure
large crops with the usual late spring showers..; In
â¢ gome counties north of the bay. the rainfall has been
very heavy during the past three t or four days. The
south, however, is still neglected on this score, and
though it has received some rain a good deal more is
needed. There is an active demand for wheat, bar
i ley, butter, eggs, hay, potatoes, and other farm pro
ducts,, and at prices considerably over the normal as
a rule. The farmer has had very little to complain,
of during the past year, which is a good thing, for
the farmer as a rule gets the short end of most propo
sitions, and everybody, is glad when things go his
way. He will roll up another" good â¢ year, unless
current indications fail, and' if he does the whole
State -'will do > likewise/
'A survey of business conditions all over, the, State
reveals nothing but [prosperity! San" Francisco is
â¢ still doing a large local v and export business.'. real
estate is decidedly looking up, both in city and coun-'
> try, the demand for property being more active than
for years, and at impioving prices, both for farms ;
and town lots. 'Population is' increasing, rapidly. and
; everybody seems to . have ' money. . "
But the week w,as not wanting in many very
favorable indications. The South, which has lately
been handicapped by considerable depression in the
cotton trade, is now cheered by a marked improve
ment in this industry, raw cotton having taken the
up grade again, with advancing quotations and an in
crease of 13 per cent in ih% exports during the past
five months, while Chicago reports increased orders
from Southern wholesalers. It is to be hoped that
cotton will continue to improve, for .the South has
been lagging behind the rest of the country for a
year or more. There is a fear, however, that cotton
is being over-exported, and that in consequence our
American manufacturers are not as fully supplied as
they should be. Meanwhile the manufactured cotton
is following the raw material up, and a number of
lines report advanced quotations and - large orders
extending into the future. The. iron and steel trades,
too, are keeping up their record-breaking pace, with
immense orders for future delivery. This industry,
however, is still sadly hampered by scarcity of cars,
which has caused the temporary suspension of oper
ations at a number of important mills. The South
west is suffering from lack of water, and St. Louis
and Kansas City report that the railroads are haul
ing it one hundred miles, while the wheat crop in
that section is being cut down materially by the
same deficiency. The spring trade is reported lively
and expanding all over the country, the best reports
still coming from the West and Northwest, though
Eastern advices are much better than heretofore.
The failures last. week were 265, against 226 for the
same week last year.
x -r tIIILE there are not at present any pro
\f\/ nounccd features to general trade there
V Y are many minor ones which, indicate that
t..c .j^siness of the country is still on an unshaken
basis and that there are no signs now that the cur
rent activity and prosperity will not continue indent
nitely. The bank clearings of the country last week
fell off to a decrease of 1.4 per cent as compared
with the corresponding week last year, and a num
ber of the largest cities heretofore showing regular
gaifrs appeared in the column of decreases. The ag
gregate clearances cf the country, too, were the
smallest for a long time, but this does not necessarily
imply a slackening in trade, being largely due to
the interruption to railway traffic and general busi
ness by the severe storms over the land a fortnight
ago. This is shown by the decrease of 3.5 per cent
in railway earnings during the first week in Febru
ary, this being the first falling off in these earnings
for a long time. " That these signs, which at first
glance seem unfavorable, only indicate transitory
conditions, is shown by the fact that rebuilding, fol
lowing recent explosions and great fires, has been
promptly begun, and on a greater scale than before.
This feature is attracting attention, as showing gen
eral commercial confidence throughout the country.
THE CONDITION OF TRADE.
The matter is one of serious concern to the mu
nicipality, and should .be kept in mind by the public
generally as well as by the municipal authorities. As
the requests of the police department for patrol boats
have been in the, past, so 'they may 'be againj
unless public sentiment is aroused on the subject. It :
is for that reason" that The Call returns to the issue
and once more points out its importance. An effi
cient water front patrol cannot be provided by the
i police without patrol boats, which, will enable" them .
to guard property from assaults by thieves or bur
glars approaching from the water/ That much will'
not be disputed by -any one who has any acquaint
ance with the situation. , A' water: patrol is therefore â¢
a' matter of urgency, and should be supplied^ at the
earliest moment possible.. ; ;; . *
.Every other- civilized city: in' v the' world having an
extensive water front provides^ "for- police supervisio; n
on water as well as on land. In the seaport cities of
our own country that/gervice is' provided for' as care
fully, as any other. ; :' Sali Francisco is the only con
siderable seaport; in the .United States where ,' the -po-"
lice department- is handjcappel by : a lack', of s means
for watching ,and pursuing water thieves; and'yet 'it
is safe to say; there isUiardly; any, city,' not even'ex
cepting the largest, such as New York and Chicago,
where a, water patrol is so important as here. 'â¢ ' i

; The United States contemplates the alliance with
complacency.' We could not make such an alliance
on paper. But our policy in the East is , identical
with that of. England. If the sentiment of this new
treaty so impress China that she is moved to enter
into one like it with Great Britain and Japan, there
will rise in the East a new dreibund that will eclipse
Germany's triple alliance in ' Europe, and will arch
the bow of promise over all the future of Asia.
But is.it not true that her designs upon the Indian
frontier are out of time? Since^the Sepoy rebellion a
great change has^come over India. It is no longer
rebellious â¢ in feeling toward Great Britain. The
Rajahs have been conciliated.- The religious sec
taries '._ have : been' kept apart, and the museum^ of
races on that great peninsula is a British museum,
English in feeling, loyalty arid purpose.- The Hin
doos themselves, introspective, cultivating philoso
phy, rather than the defensive arts, have for ages
been subject to foreign masters and the history of
their country since Clive's victory at Plassy presents
the English as the best masters -they have had. With
all its "errors English rule . contrasts favorably with,
that of the descendants of the Timour, the Mahome
tan Moguls, who sat on. the peacock throne at Delhi.
Russia, in the light of her anti-English intrigues- in
Persia, has anticipated an Indian .uprising against
England if the Cossacks 'marched over the border.;
But this will not be. If a counter move were made
on India, Russia must get what she gains as a con
queror, not as a deliverer. Therefore, it is probable
that she will bear in silence the Anglo-Japanese alli
ance and all that it implies. , .
The power that is hit hardest is' Russia, for her
designs were the most ambitious. So far she has
made no^ sign, and her flinching is kept out of sight
of her. rivals. Her policy, since she began her march
ever the Khanates of Central Asia, has been, to ap
proach as near to England's Indian frontier as pos
sible, planting herself within striking distance, to de
liver a blow when -it suited her policy. To this end
she dominates the Shah, has intrigued with the
Ameer of Afghanistan and has disturbed the men
who watch over the affairs of Turkistan.
In addition to this, it is the first treaty of alliance
mTade between an Asiatic and Western power. It
advances Japan to the. rank of the ruling nations of.
the world, gives her the hegemony of Asia, assures
her territorial integrity and internal. stability. As far
as English diplomacy is concerned, it is the master
stroke of all the ages. Up to this time Disraeli's
purchase of control of the Suez canal has held the
record in modern English statesmanship. The im-;
portance of that act is marvelously' enhanced by this
coup of Lord Salisbury. England controls the Medi
terranean by Gibraltar, the short water route to the
Orient by the canal, the Indian ocean by her Indian
empire, and is stationed along the â¢ route eastward
in Burmah, Ceylon and the Straits Settlements, and,
with her standard raised beside that of Japan, in the
Western Pacific, appears as the primate of the des
tiny of Eastern Asia.
. The Anglo-Japanese treaty : changes all this, and
has set a higher mark for the world in all dealings
with Asia. Hereafter it is going to be very difficult
for the Western nations to prosecute aggression by
treaty in Asia.
In the first place it is the first abandonment of the
historic attitude, maintained by the Western nations
toward Asia. Heretofore the Western nations have
never acknowledged 'equality of right in an Asiatic
government. The European treaties 1 with the East
ern nations have been as" a rule forced, made under
duress and for the purpose of gaining advantage for
the stronger party at the expense of the weaker. Of
this class were the French and English treaties with
China following the sacking of Pekin in i860. The
Russian treaty Â¦ relating - to Manchuria that is still
pending is of the same -class. -While the other .... na
tions were holding China down, occupying her capi
tal, and her government was in flight and in hiding,
Russia' sought, to take advantage of Jier defenseless
condition and force a treaty that was for the ex
clusive advantage of Russia. Only the deathbed
firmness of Li Hung Chang "prevented the accom
plishment of this Muscovite plot.
NO event amongst the nations has ever, stirred
diplomacyias near to its depths as the treaty.
" of alliance, offensive and defensive, between
England, and Japan. ..

The Old Humpbacks
It was announced by Mr. Schussier that
so soon as the water rates for this year
had been fixed by. the Board' of Super
visors the company was prepared to build
a tunnel under the bay at a depth of
ninety-one feet below lowest depth of the
water large enough to contain the pipes
needed to utilize the supply from the dam
which" will be built this year.
- A. trip will be made to the San Mateo
County properties of the company dur-
Injr the week. -
After leaving Sunol a trip was made to
the artesian wells, sixty-eight In num
ber, which have : been bored recently near
Pleasanton. According to Mr. Schusslur,
there are two developedsources of suppiy.
One Is a flowing river, which apparently
has its source in Mount Diablo, and at a
small depth can be tapped. This water is
used by the residents of Pleasanton, and
experiments - made by- the company show
.that -if the water in the wells supplied
from this source are.heayily drawn. upon
the people of Pleasanton suffer for- water.
The second source is a well defined sub
terranean lake of water comprising some
700 acres, so far as investigation has gone,
which is apparently inexhaustible. The
average depth of the wells reaching this
lake is slightly over 200 feet, and the nat
ural pressure, as developed yesterday,
showed a six-inch column of water thrown
fully ten feet above ground.
- The water, from these wells Is controlled
and can be turned at short notice into the
natural bed of gravel into which flows all
the water of the San Antonio, Calaveras
and Laguna valleys. . The underground
workings, of the different branches of thu
system were thoroughly examined and
explained. The methods of controlling the
supply was illustrated . by practical op
erations. â¢ â
Mr. Schussier drove the party to the
San Antonio Valley, where it is proposed
to erect a dam 130 feet high to eaten ire
water of the basin 1 embraced ' in one cf
the natural catchment basins and which
will' be filtered through the stratum of
gravel which investigation ehows under
lies the whole section traversed.
According to tne statements made by
Schussier, there are three valleys in the
Bunol district which alone are capable of
supplying this city with all tne water
needed. A watershed of 1S5 square milts
drains Into tne several valleys, of which
the company owns thirty-two square
miles. Inis property is a natural bed of
gravel, into which tne water sinks and Is
retained until it is necessary to use it.
The .company" has tapped the -bed of
gravel and is now piping the water under
neath the bay to the city.

of Public Works yesterday investigated
the sources of the water supply of that
company in the valleys adjacent to Sunol
and Pleasanton in Alameda County. The

The speaker said further that under the
law in Chicago people of various nation
alities and creeds were compelled to care
for their dependent children. The pur
pose of the law In the treatment of chil
dren was to care for Â¦ and , train them the
same as might be done in a private fam
ily. When a boy or girl falls into the
hands of. the law because of some act of
his or . hers, the child is reprimanded by
the court and sent away in. charge of a
probation officer.. This attache 6t the
court pays periodical visits to the home
of the child and watches its future con-
duct;
If it shows a disposition to do what is
right it is released, but if the contrary,
the court orders its detention in a re
formatory. A valuable assistant to the
operations of the court is the compulsory
education law and the child-labor law.
Children are required to go to school un-
Jtil they are 14 years of age. The Chicago
ODD FELLOWS CONDUCT
ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIOiSr
The general subject of the care and
treatment of children by legal process
was considered in the afternoon. The
principal speaker was Mrs. Margaret P.
Falconer, a probation officer of a Chicago
court. She explained the character of her
duties under the law relative to the hand
ling of boys and girls who come under
the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. She
said no child should be sent to .jail or
kept there for a prolonged period. The
contaminating influences encountered at
the police station by a child under 12
years of age necessarily were harmful.
THE sessions of the State â¢ Confer
ence of Gharities . and Corrections
were largely attended yesterday.
The afternoon meeting was held at
the First Unitarian Church, at
Geary and Franklin streets, while the
evening session was held at the Young j
Men's Christian Association.
) The majority, of the Arizona newspapers
are favorable - to Â» Daniels' appointment.

indorsed the suggestions of Mrs. Falconer:
and said the Idea of- a juvenile^ court was
one that ought [ to be extended .all over

probate department of. the Superior Court
he had concluded. that the State ought â¢ to,
render aid to abandoned children.' Noth- .
ing was Â¦ Â¦ so miserable as - an abandoned .
child left a waif I by vicious parents. The
Penal 'Code was not made for children. It
was not always the fault of parents that'
children become wayward, but frequently
conditions were.such as to render parental
control futile. Mental and manual train-,
ing of children should go hand in hand to
gether. What is needed, more than any-,
thing else in the handling of children. Is a
knowledge of child nature. > Â¦ â¢ Â¦
â The speaker expressed the hope that the
Constitution of California was sufficiently;
elastic to'permit the- framing and enact
xrient of a law ' which would embody the
essential features of the Illinois law re
lating to children. .He belUved a com
pulsory education law in this State would

The conference will close with sessions

of the: dependent child will be the theme
for the closing ' session. .. :
The cities of the world are at once filled with
vice ' and the highest virtues. Some one has
said God made the country, and man the cities.
Notwithstanding this, more good is, accom
plished -in the cities than in . the coun
try. This is largely due to the Intelligent press
which ' affords , daily university extension les
sons in matters of life. . Character is developed
by the 1 struggle for. existence. .In this struggle
the normal . and abnormal man I oppose each
other. To the abnormal class belong the pau
pers. . ! The /terms poverty and pauperism are
not â¢ synonymous. . Many a pauper has died
wealthy.- but a- poverty-stricken man will often
die penniless. â¢ Intemperance is an outgrowth
from rather than a cause of industrial dis
tress in. the world. They talk about the great
labor question continually.' I tell you that the
lack 1 - of . knowledge . displayed by : most - , house
wives Is more harmful than all the saloons be
tween here and New York.' You hear much of
the servant -girl . problem, but as the most /of
our housewives are their own servants .there
can be no servant girl problem. All these
things render the question of . charity one of
supreme importance. The new charity mu3t be
honest, vigorous, persevering and stern as the
pagan Greek and gentle in its administration
as Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. Charity
is wasted when bestowed upon the undeserving.
The chief function of the Associated Charities
is to Investigate every appeal carefully.
' .Dr. Smith 'discussed the labor problem,
talked of the ; social , evils, denounced
heredity as a "nasty sham," and touched
upon the differences , between capital and
labor. : It was better "to prevent eviifa
than to cure them, and the prevention of
our . troubles cannot be accomplished
without proper- education and an earnest
regard by Ell .for the spiritual welfare
of the human race. Warm applauso
greeted the speaker at the close of his
uddness. 3aBBgttHP*B ' Â¦Â¦ . Y

Dr. r Samuel G. Smith followed with an
address on the subject, ; "Function of. the
Associated Charities." He remarked that
he had personally examined the -plans of
the Â¦ societies , at Â¦ Denver and Liverpool,
and his * judgment was that the Den /er
idea was by for the best. " The speaker
insisted that 'no money ought to be raised
in the/name of charity unless the propo
sition, has. first received the indorsement
of the Associated Charities. Resumlug,
he said: ' Â¦ -..- - . - '
The speaker referred to the operations
of charitable societies in cities of EuropÂ«
and. this country, all of which gave
away large sums. The plan of the Den
ver society was ' deemed to be the best.
The system,, it was believed, would be
beneficial ; to . the needy and .at the same
time protect the .merchants of the citv
against imposition and fraud. As an if
lustration the speaker cited an instance;
where the name of a leading Institution
was used by private persons in giving a
'benefit" performance. While the insti
tution received J150 for the use of . ' Us
name, the promoters of ,the enterprise
divided $1500 profits. Were a systematized
plan of charity adopted here this sort of
imposition could' not : be practiced. The
appointment of : a â¢ board of J trustees to
represent the various charitable organ
izations, which .body shall exercise dis
cretionary â¢ power in all j cases* was advo
catea. â¢ Â¦ - :
the matter and -found that more money
was being disbursed in charity in San
Francisco than any other city of simitar
population in the Union.
Judge Ewing was Introduced by Frank
H. Gould, former Speaker of the Assem
bly.
The' truth is that physical healing -is but
an incident of Christian Science. It is true
that Chritsian Scientists . do insist, and, in
deed, many of us know as certainly as Paul
knew that his Redeemer lived, that Christian
Science dees bring surcease to the heartache
and heartbreak of men; that it does give
roses for ashes, peace for pain, Jove for hate,
health for disease and life for death to men,
and yet neither one of these, nor all of them
combined, is Christian Science. They did not
complain cf the opposition that Christian Sci
ence has met for it has simply been the as
sertion of inherited belief that has for cen
turies nntajroi.ized every new thought of God.
Our fathers endured thl6 before us and their
fathers before them; yet the world has con
stantly grown brighter and better. Christian
Science is e. religion of works and, of demon
strations.- It is evident that if Christian Sci
ence Is the product of a woman that fact
carries with it two conclusions: One that -it
is absolutely honest and the other that it is
absolutely pure. â¢ .
Long before the hour for the lecture to
begin the big hall was crowded to hear
the Judge, who is not unknown to many
of the followers of the science here, he
having delivered a lecture in the city
some two years ago. Judge Ewing is not
a recent convert to the First Church of
Christ, having embraced the faith some
sixteen years ago when, suffering from
asthma, he was pronounced to be incur
able, but found relief through the aid of
Christian Scientists. The lecturer said:

The Australian dog â¢ Auckland ' went
through the open* stake handily, beating
Melrose Lad for the long end of the
purse. These two greyhounds proved as
great a surprise in their company, as did
the winner and runner-up in the special
stake. They. were also selling at 20 to 1
during the morning.. - : -. Â¦ ' -.:"
The fortunes of coursing seemed against
the favorites throughout the day. . In al
most every instance they "showed, the
foot," es leashmen indicate speed, butUhe
hares proved tricky and " favored the
slower dogs to the great delight of the
men who backed only the dogs with the
long price against them. : -
The results of the coursing/with Judge
John Grace's olflclal scores, follow:
Loyal Lad ran in the name of A. R,
Curtis, but he was purchased by J. \ L.
Ross on Saturday for $100. The first prize
was $75. and as his new owner bet on him
he won the fast Crawford Lad young
ster out the first time of asking. "..;. :
The slaughter of the favorites resulted
in rank outsiders carrying off final honors.
In tne special stake Loyal Lad beat Leola.
The winner had the speed and ran up to
the hare so fast that it aid not have nme
to turn before the greyhound was down
upon it. As good- as 20 to 1 went begging
in the long ouds book on both these uoga
during the morning.
These were the conditions under which
the people who back the favorites wound
up the most disastrous day they ever ex
perienced in the park. Of the fifty-eight
courses long shots won twenty-seven, an
unusually large proportion. Of the seven
courses in the second . round of the spec
ial stake the favorites failed to score one
victory . for their backers. The : biggest
upset of the. day. was the defeat ofjiielle
Rocket by Precita Maid, about whicTi was
laid 6 to L .-Â¦/â¢-. 'Â¦Â¦ . : -
The concluding courses at Union Park
yesterday were run in a driving rain
storm. B*or a time it seemed darkness
would settle down* upon the field, and pre
vent the decision of the two stakes. .
The tournament committee decided yes
terday; that the tournament on Washing
ton's birthday would be a straight singles,
instead. of a class .singles tournament.
The best players' were in . favor of the
latter, but the men who stand rather low
in ; their classes were In favor of the
straight . handicap, - as their chances of
.winning would be Improved. . A ' tourna
ment of this kind will lack the "class"
of a class event, as several of the best
players will not participate in a straight
handicap, as they are called upon to give
too big k odds. .The tournament will com
mence on Saturday morning and Â¦. be fin
ished on Sunday/
In doubles, Gibson and Kuehn tied the
Lane brothers, the score being 8-6, 6-4, 1-6
and 1-6. A. Worthington and Dr. Noble
beat Joe Daily and Archibald Duncan: 7-5.
In singles . many good matches were
played. The best of the day. was between
Frank Stringham and Will Allen.- These
men : are . two * of the best In the second
class and are evenly matched. Stringham
was steadier than his opponent and won
in straight sets. The score: 6-3, 6-0 and 8-6.
.... Adams and Collier played a Â» two-set
match, in which honors were even, as
each player took a set. VThe score was
6-2 and 5-7. The veteran James A. Code
caused a genuine surprise when he beat
Allen in straight sets Y-5 and 6-3. Charles
Kuehn, leader of the third class, was in
fine form yesterday and beat Jack Gib
son easily. The score was 6-3 and 6-1.
With a handicap of "thirty," George
Whipple easily beat Frank Stringham one
set. The score was 6-1. Stringham then
cut the odds down to "fifteen," but his
opponent won; 6-4. Sidney Salisbury beat
Whipple; 6-2,-6-4 and 6-3. ; : Â¦Â¦ . .-.
: The match was not only an interesting
one. but also developed into an amusing
one. After the first two- sets a strong
wind came up and with it a heavy mist,
which, made it almose impossible for the
players to proceed. As a result, many
unusual stroKes were made, affording the
spectators/much amusement. '. â¢'
A ..special match in doubles between
Sherwood Adams and Grant Smith and
William Collier and.Harold Crowell was
the feature of the day. The match was
a five-set affair, > but only* tour sets were
required. -Adams and amith, after win
ning the first two sets: handily, lost the
third. The fourth and deciding set was
exceedingly close, the outcome ueing con
stantly in doubt. The complete, score in
favor of / Adams and Smith was 6-2, 6-3,
3-6 and 10-8..
The inclement weather made play on
the tennis courts yesterday rather light.
Many of the cracks were on hand, but the
high wind and mist prevailing spoiled the
sport to a great extent. ;
â¢Â¦ The few spectators on the beach at that
hour were startled when a frightened
horse dashed into. the surf. In the buggy
were two lads, about 16 years of age, both
of whom were apparently - too much terr
ror-stricken to restrain the animal. The
alarm was given and before the vehicle
reached the danger line in the surf sev
eral of the life-saving crew appeared and
speedily rescued the outfit. The horse was
almost drowned and the young drivers
were in .little .better state. The animal
was r returned to the "owner later in the
evening while the drivers disappeared.
Their names are unknown.
What might have proved a serious acci
dent? was â¢ narrowly averted yesterday
afternoon when two lads seated In a
buggy drove into the surf near the Cliff
House. The -high wind succeeded m rais
ing a monstrous swell before 3 o'clock and
the siw"f rolled in with ususual violence
throut,*iout the afternoon.

Irwin appreciates the importance of
his present engagement He has left
nothing undone to perfect his condition.
He tells his friends he will show the wide
gulf which separates the amateur light
weight champion from the professional.
The boxers will receive 50 per cent of
the gate receipts. Of this the winner
will receive 75 per cent and the loser 25.
The attendance is expected to be the
largest ever attracted to a similar affair
In Oakland. "Billy" Lavigne, manager of
the Acme Club, is making' elaborate ar
rangements to handle the expected
crowd. Extra trains will meet the boats
and will be held fifteen minutes if the
right lasts longer than is expected.
His training quarters were the objec
tive point of many of his friends yester
day. They saw him go through his gym
nasium work, which lasted a half hour.
He weighed 133 pounds when he finished.
He is shiftier, faster and stronger than
he has ever been. His confidence is of
the quiet, convincing order.
Britt does not attempt to conceal his
ideas regarding the outcome of the fight.
He believes he will win in five rounds,
and is frank enough to say so. "Irwin
is a hard man to defeat," he says, "but
1 think I can take his measure. If I
cion't I'll go away back and sit down. It
was with considerable hesitation I de
cided to turn professional. I could get no
rhoie matches as an amateur, and I was
ba interested in boxing that 1 wanted to
get on with a good man. If I find I'm
not -billed to be as good a professional
as I was an amateur X will quit the box
ins buEinees post haste and go back to
keeping books and figuring the cost of
leau pipe in the plumoing shop."
Britt is. not worrying as to the outcome
of his first engagement. He let up de
cidediy in his work some days since and
gained three. pounds la weight immediate
ly. The effect of this was seen at once,
as it freshened him up and made him
eager for his exercise. His musdes are
beginning to be strongly outlined under
his skin and there seems no indication
of his not being able to stand any pace
Irwin may set.
There is little betting on the fight,
Irwin's intimate friends holding out for
tven money, while the Brltt contingent
expects odds on the strength of their
man, an amateur, meeting a professional.
Tim McGrath has a reputation for tid
ing men over bad places in a fight and
cf sending them In refreshed after the
minute breathing spell allowed by the
Queensberry rules.
Kelly has no equal in picking out the
Â¦weak points in &â¢ boxer's defense and in
directing the man he is handling, how
he can batter it down. He is a master
of ring craft and his practical advice
will be of great value to the amateur.
Boxer Jimraie Britt will have the most
skillful professional seconds on the coast
behind him when he enters the ring to
morrow night in Oakland. He has se
cured "Spider" Kelly. Tim HcGrath,
Charles Reno and Curtis Richardson.
In a' few days Fitzsimmons will go to
Louisville, where he is to referee the bout
between Terry McGovern and Dave Sulli
van next Saturday night. - Â»; ".:
Fitzsimmons and Gus Ruhlin had sev
eral lively goes with the gloves last week
and the Akron giant announces that Fitz
simmons is as fast and can hit as hard
as ever. -
"Bob" Fitzsimmons has been doing light
training at Bath Beach ever since it be
came likely that he would be matched
with Jeffries. He was satisfied that he
could stand hard training before he agreed
to sign at the terms ottered by Jeffries.
The brisk breezes that prevail at Bath
Beach and vicinity suit Fitzaimmons for
his road.work. In addition, he has a well
equipped gymnasium in his barn, where he
puncnes tne bag and boxes with anybody
that wants a go. â¢
Jeffries Â¦ will leave the city to-morrow
morning for Altoona, J Pa., where he is
to fill an engagement to-morrow night.
The champion is booked for a string of
one-night stands. He was suffering from,
a cola yesterday and it' Is possible ~he
will rest tor a few days to recuperate.
Jeffries said to-day i
"It is impossible for me to say Just
now when Â± will train for my flgnt with
i'nzslmmons. The bids for the contest
will be evened on March 15. By that
time I will be In California. If a San
> rancisco club is awarded the fight I
win begin training at once at Harbin
Springs,, where I prepared for my fight
with Kuhlln. I understand that several
clubs besides those In San Francisco will
bid, and it -is possible tnat one of them
may get the fight." â¢ . .
NEW. YORK, Feb. 16.â "Jim" Jeffries
and "Bob" Fitzsimmons spent a quiet
daytd-day, apparently happy that they
have at last arrived at the stage where
mere | talking about a fight has j ceased.
Each. man is confident he can beat the
"other in their coming battle for the
championship; hence their satisfaction at

RENO, Nev., Feb. 16.-An epidemic,
claimed by the State Board of Health to
be smallpox, has made its appearance in
Reno. Seven cases already have been re
ported. The afflicted persons have been
removed to the "pesthouse, three mile*
from Reno. The public schools have been
closed to block a spread of the disease.
Last Monday President Stubbs, by
agreement with the State Board of
Health, placed a partial quarantine on
the State University, and requested ail
students living on tne campus to . retrain
from going down town, and asked down
town students to go to and from their
studies directly to their place's of abode
and not mingle with the general - public
This was considered the simplest method
of precaution against contagion. The stu
dents were inclined to rebel from the
start, and five of their number came down
town Monday night in violation of the
regulation. President Stubbs promptly
suspended them. This caused a general
Insurrection, resulting in slxty-flve young
men coming down town last night In a
body. Wednesday morningr President
Stubbs suspended them, making about
seventy now under the ban.
A committee from the suspended stu
dents called upon President Stubbs about
noon and asked him If he would receive
a committee of citizens who would inter
view him in their benalf. President
Stubbs courteously Informed them that he
would receive any committee of citizens
that might see fit to call upon him. A
committee selected by the suspended stu
dents, consisting of Dr. O. H. Thoma, G.
F. Turrittin and S. Summerfleld, went to
the university to confer with President
Stubbs. The conference lasted for three
hours, shortly after which the following
bulletin was posted:
"All students below the senior gTade ara
suspended until the morning of February
24, when they may return to their classes.
Members of the senior class who partici
pated in the meeting are suspended in
definitely, but may after February 24
make written application to the president
for . reinstatement. Suspended students
living Within a reasonable distance are re
quired to go to their homes, those living
far away may remain with friends, but
cannot stay within five miles of Reno. No
suspended student shall visit Reno dur
ing the period of suspension."
Tne situation is openly discussed upon
the streets, and much abuse is heaped
upon the heads of the university faculty
for their action. It is claimed that Presi
dent Stubbs has exceeded his power, as
has also the Board of Health. The strin
gent rule which created all the dissension
is as fallows: '
The dormitory boys were forbidden the
privilege of Reno's business streets, while
the resident students were allowed to go
almost where they pleased. At the same
:lme all students were allowed to minglÂ©
together In the classrooms. The students
rebelled against this rule and demanded
equal rights with the resident students.
This being denied them they broke the
quarantine, and as a result were suspend
ed. All Nevada is greatly agitated over
the affair.

. By unanimous consent the census bill
will be disposed of after the Danish treaty
i and before the debate on the Philippine
bill is taken up. It is expected that a vott
-will be reached . on the census bill after
very little more debate. ' - - .
- The coming week promises to be one of
.unusual activity In the House of Repre
sentatives. Beginning tomorrow, the war
revenue reduction bill will . be taken up,
.with two days for debate, and a stringent
special rule bringing the bill to a vote at
3 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon, without
Intervening motion to recommit or amend
ments other than thqse of a verbal char
acter proposed by the committee. At the
outset there promises to be a spirited con
test on the adoption of -the special rule,
as the minority will protest against the
cutting off of amendments and the motion
to recommit. There is little doubt, how
ever, that the rule will be adopted.
.When the debate proper begins, there
will be- hardly more than three hours. on
each side. This time will.be given to the
members of the Ways and Means Commit
tee, who in r turn will apportion It among,
their colleagues. The passage of the bill
is a foregone conclusion, as the minority
members as well as the majority favor it,
the only difference being as to the amount
of reduction and the extent to which
tariff changes should go.
Aside from the tariff tissue, it would be
no -surprise if the sensational speech of
Representative Wheeler of Kentucky "an
Prince Henry's visit and other foreign
matters figures in the discussion, as much
feeling has been aroused by the speech.
i If the consideration of the treaty be not
concluded to-morrow its final disposition
probably will be postponed for several
days, as Senator Lodge has agreed to
sidetrack the Philippine bill for only one
day. " -
With reference to the Philippine bill, it
is altogether probable that a vote will be
reached during the latter part of , the
week. The Democrats have been in con
ference and have reached' the conclusion
that they Will be able to conclude the
presentation of their opposition to the bill
in a few more speeches. An agreement
fixing a time to vote is likely to be reached
on Tuesday, and the indications now are
that next Friday or next Saturday will
.be named as the day for deciding the fate
of the bill.

under the control of the War Department,
the report says, estimates the entire cost
of a Pacific cable, including ships and all
possible contingencies, at $10,000,000, and
places the annual expense at $525,000. His
judgment is : confirmed by; the opinion Â¦ of
Rear Admiral. R.; B. Bradford, chief of

ands.-; There, is no longer- any doubt as
to the practicability, of this project Â¦ from

In conclusion the report says:'
The right to construct and- operate the Pa

TREATY LIKELY
TO BE RATIFIED
Despondency was the cause of both sui
cides. Mrs. cohn had once nearly a year
ago attempted to take her life, and her
successtul effort to-night was the culmi
nation of what her friends and husband
believe was a period of temporary mental
abberation of more than a week's dura
tion. The Curren girl had quarreled with
her lover, a telephone lineman, who lives
at Everett.
. Mrs. Cohn was a handsome woman,
about 28 years of age, and. had lived
here about three years, coming to Seattle
with her husband, Louis Cohn, Â¦ a bar
tender, from San Francisco. For the
past two years the couple had lived at
the Brewster House. - Persons who were
acquainted with them claim that their
home life was happy, but that Mrs. Cohn
was subject to lits of despondency, in
which she would threaten to take her
own life. In one of these she took mor
phine, and was saved only after the pro
longed efforts of a physician.
Saturday night Mrs. Cohn left, the lodg
ing-house after telling several friends that
she intended to go out and take poison.
Her husband and the landlady of the
Brewster House, Mrs. Jennie Hiedaux,
spent the entire night In searching for
her, but without success. Late this even
ing Cohn went out to continue the search.
Ten minutes after his departure Mrs.
Cohn entered the house and went to her
room. A few moments later she called
for Mrs. Hiedaux. Just as the latter en
tered, the room Mrs. Cohn drank two
ounces of carbolic acid from a small vial
she had brought to the house with her.
Mrs. Hiedaux sprang forward to wrench
the poison from her hand, but was too
late. Messengers were sent to find
a physician, and Dr. Bories finally . re
sponded. He worked over the suffering
woman for. nearly an hour but could do
nothing to counteract the effects of the
poison. The body was removed to the
! morgue on the order of Coroner Hoj'e,
Â¦who was summoned after death had oc
curred. Two hours later the husband re
turned to the house and heard the news
of the tragedy.
Less tnau.a hour later Edith Curren,
a beautiful girl, 19 years of age, who had
been employed as a waitress In a Third
avenue restaurant, took her life by the
tame means in her room at the Plaza
.House, corner of 'Anird avenue and Union
street.

work. You may prove - whether it is or
not by leaving if off for ten days or. two
weeks, although it often takes from nine
months to two years to recover from. its
effects. ..... - ; â¢-.
Mr. J. W. Ashby. ML Airy, N. C. says:
"I was 4 coffee drinker, for 25 years.
About three years ago I suffered " greatly
with pains in the region of my heart, and \
the pit of my stomach. These pains ap-|
peared about the same time each day. ,
"I. wondered "if coffee might not be the
fault, so began the test of leaving off cof-
fee. The pains ceased, , but when I be-
gan to use coffee again' the same old
pains would 'bob up.' I have now been
using Postum for some time in' place of
, coffee and am entirely, cured of the old
' neuralgia of the stomach and heart. ' Re-

MAKING READY
TO CELEBRATE
Captain Tolle, with two men, left Rio
December 17, In a small boat in search? of
assistance. He had learned of; schooners
that were due at Manga Reva, an island
300 miles distant. They reached "Manga
Riva on the third day, having beendriven
the whole 300 miles by a series' of -'tierce
squalls. no available -vessel > at
Manga Reva, ] Captain Toole f decided -'= to
continue his cruise ; as far as;,Tabiti,' 1200
miles distant. Y, It was against the. French
law, however, for an open; boat to leave
the barbor,.so he was compelled Â¦ to wait.
A trading vessel arrived January^ 10 and*
the skipper offered, â¢ f or'j $1000, : to -pick .up
the shipwrecked crew and takethemto
Captain Goes for Assistance^
From . November 14 until January 17,
when the French gunboat Zeiee' arrived
at' Rio and took, them aboard, -the ship
wrecked mariners lived- on : the : natural:
products of the island. -They .> found it;
poor fare, and when rescued' were greatly
reduced in flesh. . They were all 'blessed
wltn; good health, however. There' had
been : no accidents in getting ashore Â¦ from'
the wreck,- and barring a weariness .: of

TIRES OF LIFE,
TURNS ON GAS
Here we found swarms of natives, who were
friendly enough toward us and were already
engaged in getting . ashore' some of the ship's
effects. With their assistance we managed to
save a few stores, but the- sea' had done its
work well. The cabin was practically washed
out. The ship's papers, and all my personal
effects wer-i lost. I did save, the ship's chro
nometer, however, and upon '.testing it soon
found out why we had hit the island, which
We ret the boats ready for â¢ launching, and
when It was seen that the vessel was rapidly
filling they were lowered. We stood by the
ship until daylight, - when we found the . seas
breaking entirely over her. . Natives, by signs,
directed our- course to a* landing place. .We
Â»ot ashore and all hands made for. the scene
of the* wreck. Â¦ Â¦ > .:'-.-. .
Natives Were' Friendly.
That's how the sailormen speak of the
adventure. The story of the last, voyage
and loss of the Savernake and of the sub
sequent tribulations of the bark's com
pany was told yesterday . by Captain
Toole. He said:
We left San Francleco on October 9 -with a
cargo of barley. We were bound for the Eng
lish Chenr.el for orders. . All went well until
November US; wfrrn v.e* found ourselves in the
vicinity of I tne Paumotu group of the Soclety
Islands. in f eggy wrathcr and with very un
eatisfactory v/imis I tiiea , to get some .'stel
lar oyistrvations that : r.rsht. but the sky. was
toa overcast. A - cIofÂ«> lrokout was kept . for
land and the . rÂ«itont lpg was in constant use.
There wan" a cry, "Land to leeward." shortly
after midnight. I jumped on deck, . saw .' the
laid, ordered the helm down and mainsails
clewed up. The vessel came around on I the
starboard tack, the fore and -main sheets were
hauled aft, but the. ship's stern touched the
reef, the breakers sent the \ vessel broadside on
and she began to bump heavily. ' .
"Two months on a blooming coral reef
with a lot of black beggars that used to
be . cannibals, arid looked - as. if they'd
blooming well like to 'scoff' us anyhow
if we only gave them half a chance." â¢ j
"Sixty-two days on cocoanuts and shell

, One of .the young men said in regard to
the'find:.-: :. ;- , v .'Â¦:Â¦ .. . .
-Â¦ VWe first looked on' the matter: as'- a 'joke,
but remembered we had read in a morn
ing Â¦ paper v that A:' H. ' Brown,', proprietor
of ; the | Oyster I Bay restaurant on | JSlgntu
avenue and Fulton street,- had seen a man
who appeared , to 'â¢; be injured in ? the head
at his place on .the "morning. of January
12, and that the mysterious stranger re
sembled ; the description of the Â¦ murderer.
We ; at' once realized . that there might; be
some connection between the finding, of
the revolver and the; story of Brown, and
determined Ito '.make our discovery- public
in hopes Â° that : It might aid in , sol ving the
mystery ;of .- Nora . Fuller's murder." -
The size: of .; the 'revolver and cartridges
and: the handwriting on: the note all seem
to point to Â¦ the conclusion '< that the evj
dence was placed' on ..the beach by some
one- who -iwas, desirous i of perpetrating a
hoax. .The â¢ cartridges are <Â¦ of BB size and
do not . contain â¢ enough * powder-, to inflict
a serious wound: unless helcj to some part
of^ the | bpdy 'Â¦ which . offers | a -minimum re
sistance. â¢ .The handwriting, ' while plain,
does not seem 1 to | resemble in any | manner
that of the man who signed the name C
B. Hawkins to > the real estate dealer's
book, i or, who inserted, the advertisement
in a morning newspaper.,, ' Â¦. , \. '-.-.
Gradually the! police are coming to the
theory i.that the man who is responsible
for the death of Nora Fuller is either a
traveling man ;. from, the - East, -or a
resident of .some of the; towns close to
San .-, Francisco, who is of such standing
in : his home community * as to" entirely
escape suspicion. ; They are also inclin-
In.T â¢ to the belief ' that : he had â¢ no - inten
tion of destroying ' the , child's life when
he: 1 lured her ito the, Sutter-street house,"
but merely â¢ desired to satisfy Â¦, his lust.
Despite ? the ;. verdict of the ' autopsy sur
geon they, doubt that the, girl's death was
due | to strangulation, % but , incline ; to the
belief i that - she ' expired from shock and
hemorrhage, combined - possibly with
chloroform; poisoning.'; The Inquest is ex-"
pected . to } reveal - some details Â¦ of the
autopsy surgeon's report that have not
been made public. V . , ;
