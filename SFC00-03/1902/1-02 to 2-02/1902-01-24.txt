. Foster! read from the remarks of Min
ister Wu before the Committee on For
eign Relations during the last session, In
which he" spoke . of - the Indignities and
humiliations alleged to have been suffered
by nome of his people at the hands of our
immigration officers. ,
General Howard Is Heard.
â¢ Major, General O. O. Howard said he In
dorsed all. that Foster "said. He had come
In contact with the Chinese on the Pacific
Coast, and characterized the alleged un
due diligence of Chinese inspectors in the
performance of "their duties as "among
the iniquities of the present. execution of
the exclusion law." ]
I Senator McLaurin of Mississippi asked
Foster if ,Wii's 7 statements were not ex
parte.' Foster responded that*fthe;state
ments had riot s been contradicted by the
Secretary., of the -, Treasury or the Com
missioner of Immigration, and that those
officials either did j not give credence - to
them or failed to report them. -Foster pro
tested against^ star chamber proceedings
with respect; to Chinese exclusion, . saying
they, were giving no opportunity for. them
to go In court arid be heard.
Powderly . spoke of the matter referred
to by Foster, land said he thought It grew
out of an' anonymous communication.' The
case was,- he said, : investigated and found
to be without ; a scintilla of truth. Pow

MINISTERS OF POWERS
ATTAIN GOAL AT PEKING
"PEKING, Jan. 23. â The Ministers of the
foreign powers .here have attained the
goal which has been their aim since Inter
course between China and the powers be
gan. They have been received as repre
sentatives of sovereigns equal in rank to
the Chinese Emperor. ,
Â¦ The audiences yesterday between the
Emperor and the Ministers were held in
the Innermost large hall of the Forbidden
City. The Emperor sat upon a dais behind
a table. There were four princes at the
back of his chair and a dozen officials on
each side.
- The Dowager Empress was concealed by
a screen, . according to the stories of the
attendants, and remained lnviaihl*. -\ A;
An odd : fact about the , preamble and
resolutions is that they were in, an even
ing newspaper office in San Jose before
the convention had' assembled, and there
fore necessarily before any 'committee on
resolutions could have been .appointed j by
the convention. They went through with
out any .discussion, although they 'con?
talned one. remarkable' mlsstatement
which none of the attendants seemingly
noticed. This was that .the Legislature
authorized: the, purchase of 2500 acres* in'
Santa Cruz County." The act of the Leg
islature! put no limit ; oh the 'acreage:' to
be "acquired. "The ; commission -.was;;au

tract of land commonly known as the Big

appreciation of ' the . generosity, public spirit
and high sentiment displayed by the owners of
the tracts under negotiation in refraining from

half, and especially 'since the expiration of,thÂ«
bond, and :in now continuing to -delay y active

the appointment of a .committee of five
on resolutions, and the committee was
made to consist; of A. P. Hill, Duncan
McPherson of Santa . Cruz, W- D. J.
Hambly, John E. Richards and the Rev!
Mr. Williams, of Saratoga/ This commit
tee brought In a preamble and resolu
tions.The preamble contained the state
ment that "the 'Legislature at its last
session created a commission for the pur
chase of 2500 acres of this forest and the
conversion of them into a public park." â¢"Â¦''
Â¦ The; statement' was also made* in the
preamble j that j the land under considera
tion Is worth an average price of $100 per
acre/ The trees were represented to be
in immediate danger of being cut because
the' bond 1 on '. the jj property lapsed 3 thla
month. Then followed resolutions call-
Ing upon the. commission to take .imme
diate action; providing I that the commis
sion should be notified- of the action of
the convention, and also the following; \v
Â¦ "W. w. Richards of San. Francisco was
elected secretary. Then A. P. Hill moved
"The people demand thaf the law which
provides for the purchase of; these trees
shall be carried out In letter "and spirit."
This audience and the orators who are to
address you are but a slight;manifesta
tion of a demand which Is well nigh uni
versal and an earnest of the Interest that
will be felt In the care and preservation
of the redwoods and; in extending the
boundaries of the park until it; shall com
prise all of the Big Basin' that Is worthy
of being preserved."
J. O. Hayes was the permanent chair
man. He urged that . the commission
should act at once, saying:
Demand for Preservation.
The convention of to-day filled the First
Unitarian Church to its limit notwith
standing the rain. â¢ A brass band played
in front of the church just before the
opening. Within the scene was made
somewhat sylvan in its character by the
placing of fresh green boughs and a pic
ture, of the big trees in the Big Basin,
so that the effect -was pleasing. J." H.
Campbell of San Jose was . selected t or
temporary chairman and made a speech
in which he urged that the big trees
should be preserved, buthe made no at
tack upon the commission. -.-Â¦Â¦.'
Mr. Ross did not offer any resolution.
The fact is that Mr. Ross at the" early
stage of the history of the campaign for
the park suggested that In both San Ma
teo and Santa Cruz counties each section
of land In the Big Basin should be map
ped and that the records of the Assessors
should be consulted to see what each 'sec
tion was assessed at, but this suggestion
was seemingly never adopted.
"Does any one suppose that the State
Commissioners would pay $100 per acre
for the Big Basin lands? Why, to say
the worth is $400 per acre Is appealing to
credulity and not to judgment."
ject of 'the Big Basin Park was new.it
was proposed to look into the books of
the Assessors to see what the lands in
the Big Basin were assessed at? We
found that the Big Basin lands In San
Mateo County were assessed at from $6
to_$7 per acre. . /
"Does any one believe," Â¦ asked the at
torney â and his Indignation was seem
ingly greater than beforeâ "that the lands
in the Big Basin are worth $400 per acre?
Does any one believe that the owners of
those lands are going to give away, to
the State $300 per acre on their holdings?
Don't we remember that when the pro-
Value of the Acres.
SAN JOSE, Jan. ; 23.â Attorney
George C. Ross of Redwood City
created a sensation to-day at the
convention that was held in the
First Unitarian Church in this
city for the purpose of urging
action upon the State commission appoint
ed to select a park in the Big Basin in
6ar.ta Cruz and San Mateo counties.
A long preamble had been adopted, in
which It was set forth that the lands
offered to the commission by the Big
Basin Lumber Company are worth $100
per acre. D. M. Delmas had made a
epeech in which he estimated the tract
of 2500 acres offered to be worth $1,000,000.
or $400 per acre. Mr. Delmas, who fol
lowed Professor Dudley of Stanford Uni
versity, a member of the commission, had
also taken occasion to make several flings
at the commission, alleging that the com
missioners are or have been negligent and
dilatory- Then, after some other proceed
ings and near the close of the convention.
Attorney Ross arose and woke the echoes
of the quiet church by a defense of the
commission and some ringing statements
concerning the values of timber lands. In
the Bis Basin.
"Does any one believe," shouted Ross,
who was seemingly strongly moved by the
Insinuations concerning the commission,
"that Commissioner A. W. Foster or Mr.
Mills or any other, member of the hon
orable commission Is recreant to his
duty?" Mr. Ross answered this question
by enumerating the members of the com
mission, who are Governor Gage. Profes
cor Dudley of Stanford University. A.-W.
Foster, the Rev. Father Kenna of Santa
Clara College and W. H. Mills. No one
responding Mr. Ross addressed himself to
the Question of the real values of Â¦> the
lands in the Big Basin.
Â¦ Foster's third proposition was .that .the
existing "exclusion. 1 laws' and 1 the j legisla
tion* proposed are in clear disregard of the
treaty stipulations. r He cited ,the provision
of the treaty of ,1894;. which guaranteed to
"all Chinese In â¢ the , United â¢ States \ the , most
favored ; nation UreatmentT' arid i ; the', pro--',
vision* of , treaties with other nations guarÂ« ;
'â¢". His secona proposition was that the ex
clusion-laws should not' be made' ap
plicable to all our insular possessions and
said the. Hawaiian; Islands the
exact state : of .'affairs .which .was contem-.
plated by the /American "â¢ negotiators j for
the j exclusion treaty, in 'which they . gave
the assurance that'to'such'a condition of
affairs the exclusion law would not apply
when all this interests* of the islands asked
for Chinese iriunigrationand'thelocal au
thorities "agreed 'that- it would not' in any
way, affect 'whitei labor. ..; > V; :,Â¦':.,
Foster's Second Proposition.
The first was that any law passed by
the present Congress, which continues the
exclusion of Chinese laborers beyond 1904
would; be- not only without International
authority, but . would * be In violation of
treaty 'Â¦â¢ stipulations. He said that- during
the .negotiations resulting in the treaty
of 1894 the. United States sought \ to have
the exclusion of Chineselaborers evtended
to twenty years, and â¢ that " the . -Chinese
Government refused to make , it. for more
than ; ten years. He; also Insisted that
when the treaty of j 1894 (fame ;to'* an .end
the â¢ BurHngaine "" treaty of 1868 would be
revived and come into. force, whjch treaty
stipulated for â¢ the free and' unrestricted
emigration- of ; Chinese of all classes Â¦ Into
the United" States. The treaty,/ hie said,
had only been suspended,'- as to", immi
gration, : - not abrogated. .-

â¢^L"y^ / mer Secretary of State John
i^/%/ "w. Foster appeared before
; Y V.^T the Senate Committee on
immigration to-day and
spoke in opposition to the Chinese-exclu
sion bills which -have been introduced
in Congress. His remarks, were directed
more particularly to; the Mitchell or Pa
cific Coast bill, which, he said, was a plain
violation of our treaty with China. Foster
said "our Government \ had four times
asked China to modify existing treaties
in the' interest of American citizens and
that' in every instance China had acceded
to our request. He then submitted for the
consideration of the committee three prop
ositions:., ' . . -.' -
PRO^1 E^ T SHAKERS AT THE CONVENTION HELD IN SAN JOSE YESTERDAY, WHEN THE MATTER OF
JSSTSSS^^^nSyS^" 1 " REGI0N AND â¢! PRESER â¢â¢^â¢â¢-
Former Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury Hamlin. representing commer
cial organizations of Boston, and S. C.
Meade of Â¦ the Merchants' Association of
New, York appeared before the House
Committee on Foreign Affairs to-day in
opposition to the enactment of the Mltch
ell-Kahn Chinese exclusion bill. They
made arguments similar to those made
when they were before the Senate com
mittee on Tuesday.
Lee Sang and Chan Ling later In the
day were arraigned before a United States
Commissioner and held for a hearing on
Tuesday next.
Foster contended that there were only
93,000 in the United States, but Campbell
stated that the department's information
was that the Chinese population In this
country was 300,000.
Richard K. Campbell, a Chinese Inspect
or, said that in his opinion there were
100,000 Chinese- In the United State* .who
were admitted on false certificates.
Come in on False Certificates.
Foster protested against what he called
"this spectacular performance" , without
giving these two prisoners an opportunity
to appear with counsel.
The interpreter, Charles Kee, treasury
official! described the methods pursued by
a Chinese company of Chicago In manu
facturing fraudulent certificates.
they were merchants, and that they knew
of the deception. Asked what disposition
was to be made of them, Powderly said
that they would be given a fair hearing,
but that they would ultimately be de
ported.
: Secretary of State Seward. thirty-five
years ago signed a treaty with Denmark
for the purchase of St. John and St.
Thomas. He agreed to pay $7,500,000 for
these two. islands. ' The inhabitants of the
Islands consented to - accept the .United
States as their sovereign. ,;.The Senate re
fused ; to ; rati f y the" treaty. V Denmark] be
came indignant over, its rejection and : our
friendly, relations with that nation -were
considerably impaired. ' In some quarters
there is" a disposition to believe that Den
mark.has reserved to the inhabitants of
the islands the right . to â¢ pass 'upon I the
treaty in ' order that she,' may. be 'able/ to
cause its rejection in case there is danger
of such action on the* part of the Senate. '
Minister Brun sought to induce Secre-.
tary Hay to accept provisions giving in
habitants of the islands the same status
as citizens of the United States and tariff
concessions. :, Both of these matters are*
for Congress to determine, and the treaty
will simply accord; the Inhabitants, the*
same rights and privillges as were given
to Porto Ricans 'and , Filipinos. It will
contain no reference to the tariff relations,
which shall be maintained. ..
The State Department declines to make
public the draft of the treaty agreed upon.
The price is said to be between $3,000,000
and $4,000,000. , ' ..'. . . V
Price for the Islands.
| As the treaty must receive the ratifica
tion of the United States Senate this Gov
ernment, it is said, can have no objection
to the submission of the instrument to
the Danish islands for confirmation.
As the ( islands are a drain upon' the
Danish treasury, however, the Copen
hagen authorities . recognized the. neces
sity of selling them. It is understood
that a i plebiscitum will be held, . but it
will takej place after instead of before
the signing" of the 'treaty, â¢ and the con
vention, In order to be effective, must re
ceive the approval of a majority of the
inhabitants.
The outlook for. effecting the treaty
was rather gloomy for a few days, in
(view of the announcement made by. the
Danish Government that. before it could
consent' to /.dispose, of . the islands a
plebiscitum must be : held to -determine
the attitude of the. inhabitants." Secretary'
Hay stated that the ' States Â¦ could
have nothing 'to do ;vrith such procedure.

eral terms; but it could only negotiate
.with the Danish Government , and- not
with its subjects. . The suggestion; for a
plebiscitum,. was apparently advanced to
meet . the views of King Christian, the
aged ruler of Denmark, who dislikes to
seethe curtailment of "his territory, and
of certain of his subjects who believed
that the inhabitants should be consulted
before their land was ceded to another

WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.â The details of
a bill restricting anarchy and anarchists
were practically determined upon to-day
by the saecial committee of members of
the House Judiciary Committee, appointed
to consider this subject. The language of
some of the provisions Is yet to be set
tled, but all of the essential features of
the torthcoming measure are determined
upon. The measure will provide the death
penalty for an attempt to kill or assault
the President or any one in line of succes
sion for the Presidency. An accessory be
fore the fact is to be treated as a prin
cipal and an accessory after the fact is
punished in a less degree than the prin
cipal. Any person who counsels, advises
or advocates the assaulting or killing of
any officer of the United States shall be
fined or Imprisoned. No alien who advo
cates an overthrow of organized govern
ment or who is affiliated with an organi
zation holding such views is to be ad
mitted to this country. I Provision also Is
made for the punishment of those con
cpiring in this country against a foreign
ruler. The special committee probably
will report to the Judiciary Committee
within the next few days and a report to
the House is expected soon thereafter.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 23.â Consideration
of the Department of Commerce bill was
resumed in the Senate to-day, the pend
ing amendment being, that offered by Pet
tus of Alabama, providing that the-De

tne proposed new department.
Pettus made a brief argument in sup
port of his amendment. ' '
In reply Nelson, in charge of the pend
ing measure, said that throughout the
consideration of the bill he had heard no
protest against the transfer of the De
partment of Labor to the Department of
Commerce until recently an official of a
labor ! organization had objected to the
transfer. .He was convinced, he said, that

It had been his privilege to discuss this
subject with laboring men of the country
and he was. certain they favored the
pending bill. Hanna said -that the time
had come when .we must expand our com
merce or restrict our production.
At this point he was interrupted by
Hale of Maine, who said that the United
States already had captured all the for

at Hanna whether he did not realize that
as being a fact.

that at a time when Germany was using
the utmost effort to develop the sugar
industry those who represent the Ameri-'

which would have the effect of destroy
ing the American industry and- of plac
ing the production of sugar under foreign
control.
In answer to questions by Representa
tiveLong, of Kansas, Hill said -a 50 per
cent reduction would reduce the price of
raw sugar, but not on refined, the price
on the latter being fixed in Hamburg.
This. reduction of duty would not inure
to the Cuban planter, but to the foreign
purchaser.
Ex-Governor Warmouth of Louisiana
made a vigorous speech opposing conces

said, from the "syndicates and grandees

being vested in the Northern Securities

It Is not the business oÂ£ this commission to

Dealing with the traffic associations,
the commission states that - the ':Â¦ secret
"agreed" ~ rates "have been . manipulated
through these agencies, and says: '. .
' The different -lines, in an effort to: obtain -a
share of this business. - deem It ' necessary to
drive out of business the small buyer and to
c-perate their business, through a single large
concern. One effect of this is. to put" the
miller out of- the " market as _an . independent
buyer. , . . ' .- : â¢ -.- . ; .
The commission found also. In investi
gating complaints made by Western mill
ers, that, the carriers -east of Chicago
made no serious pretense of maintaining
the export rates on wheat and that - th<?
carriers had â¢ agreed among themselves
upon a rate " from Chicago 2% , cents Â¦ be
low the published tariff, resulting In a dis
crimination-of from, 2% to 4 cents against
flour. -The open wheat tariff from Kansas
City to Chicago has been 12 cents and the
actual rate as low as 5 cents.
-Of' the practice prevalent in the West
of allowing some particular' Individual a
concesElon^which enables him to:. handle

Small Buyers Driven to the Wall.
The effect is to give them an enormous ad
vantage Â¦ over j smaller . competitors located at
other points. Â¦Â¦ Already these competitors have
mostly ceased to exist. These disclosures af
ford a pregnant Illustration of the manner In
which secret rate concessions are tending to
build up great trusts and monopolies at the ex
pense of the small Independent operator.
After summar'zlns ie ioÂ»ults of its. 'in

It is urgvd that the ' twentieth 'section

VTo convict for paying* a rebate it is neces
sary to fchow not merely that the railway com
pany paid a rebate to a particular shipper,
but it must also be shown that it did not. pay
the same rebate to some other shipper with
respect to the same kind of traffic moving at
the same time under similar conditions. This
is almost always impossible. Departure from
the published rate is the thing which can be
shewn, and the thing .which should be visited
with- fitting punishment. 'â¢; . V â¢Â¦ : : i;-;
Difficult to Secure a Conviction.
Taking up the difficulty of securing
convictions in cases of rate-cutting, the
report says:
Now, the object of ratecutting Is ' to get
business and make money, and the corpora
tion, if any one, profits by the illegal act. It
is the real offender, and ought certainly to
pay the penalty as well as its officer. If
every illegal act of that character . subjected'
the carrier to a substantial forfeiture, so that
the money result of the transaction was likely
to be the other way, the inducement to com
mit such offenses would be greatly diminished.
The application of the remedy, the re
port says, is fraught with dangers to the
public and should not be applied unless
the public is fully protected. In view of
those great combinations which have
been' formed and are now forming, by
wnich railway competition will be largely
eliminated, some method should be pro
vided by which the Government can ex
ercise in fact that control over railway
rates and operations which- courts with
out number have, asserted that it pos
sesses-and which many persons suppose
that it now exerts. The commission be -
lleves that the whole law should be re
vised upon some correct theory and spine
workable basis. ' v ;, â¢<,*.' "". : . ' %.' . '
In view of the gross .violations of 'ne
act the commission suggests that if. it is
not possible to. amend this law in its. more
essential features it ought at least-*, to be
possible to deal with those coerclVeJjfea
tures of the act which are lntendM-.to
prevent practices of this character.*,--;^;.
Referring to : th6" court decisions.;, that
penalties cannot be imposed upon *; cor
porations violating the act, and that only
their Â«gents can be punished, the commis
sion says:
That there are palliating circumstances
under which railway/ traiiic officials act
the commission is not unmindful, and tne
opinion is expressed that existing laws
snould be so amended that : every man
ager who desires to observe them can do
so without risk of sacrifice of their prop
erty.
Remedy Is Fraught With Dangers.
The facts therein developed- are.' of ; such -a
.character that no thougtmui person, can con
template them with I indifference., i That a the
lending trarfic officials' of many -of ; the' prln-"
cipal railway lines, men occupying high posi
tions and charged with the most important
duties, should aeliberately violate the statute
law of the land and in sume cases agree with
each other to Uo bo; that it should be thougnt
by them necessary to destroy vouchers and' to
so manipulate bookkeeping us to . obliterate
every evidence of. the . transactions; that hun
dreds of thousand of dollars should be paid ; in
unlawful : rebates to a few great packing
houses; that the business of railroad* transpor
tation should to such an extent be conducted
In open disregard of* law, must be surprising
and offensive to all right-minded ' ' persons.
Â£qually startling at least is the fact that the
owners of these packing houses, men whose
names are known throughout the commercial
world, should seemingly be eager to augment
their gains with .the enormous amounts of
these rebates, which they receive in plain de
fiance of a Federal statute.

every foot of ground over the Panama
route- Is known, - whereas nearly nil of the
engineering Questions on the Nicaragua
are unknown quantities; because there
has been for fifty years a railroad along
the Panama route and none at Nicara

bors at either end of the Panama canal
that are now In use, while ingenuity will
be taxed to construct and maintain har
bors at either end of the Nicaragua, m
"I have had something to do with great
problems of construction, and from a bus

that Panama Is vastly superior to Nicara
gua, because at Panama we know Just
where we are and what we have to do.
Yet I am grieved to say that some very
eminent gentlemen, for whom I have
great respect, are still for Nicaragua.
They remind me of a very old story,
which you may pardon me for repeating:

I say that the horse was sixteen feet

now believed that the cost will far exceed
the sum for which Sinnott agreed to do
the work. Woodward, who ,has had six
years' experience in school affairs, ex

The question of salaries of substitutes
provoked a long discussion. Parry argued
that a 'substitute,', who takes the place of
a regular fireman, is entitled to the regu
lar s salary. He declared that if the city
paid a substitute $2 65 a day for substi
tute work when the regulars receive $3 it
was practically robbing the substitute of
35 '.cents. Commissioner Hecht thoughf
the board should not meddle with the
question, as it mfght result in a violation
of the charter. He showed that as tho
Â£Â£ emen were Paid . $80 for the first year.
$90 for -the second year and $100 for the
third year It would be unfair and illegal
to give $3 a day. to a man-who is not con
nectedwith the department > to take the
place of a regular, who gets. less than
that sum. At the suggestion of the Mayor
the matter was referred to City and Coun
ty Attorney Lane for an 'opinion.
Salaries of Substitutes.
The Civil Service Commission submitted
a list of employes in the department wno
were not classified, and asked that the
board take action >in the matter. The
matter was referred back, as the board
did not quite understand the purport of
the communication. "

ADMIRATION OF BLYTHE
. : ;.;. : FOB. ALICE EDITH'S FOOT
A rumor came to Judge Hebbard's ears
during the afternoon that the Mayor's
private secretary, George B. Keane. had
said that the Judge was laboring under
a "holdover from : the Press Club "and a
wedding of the night before." He imme
diately went to the Mayor's office and de
manded explanations from Keane, and
later he called the newspaper men into
his chambers to brand the statement,
from whatever source it emanated, as a
malicious lie."
Ruef said in closing his argument that
the whole Question was whether the May
or had authority to suspend the County
Clerk for any cause. If the Mayor could
suspend the County Clerk for dementia,
or imbecility; or apoplexy, or for larceny,
or embezzlement of funds, he could also
suspend him for such offenses as had been
alleged.
After Judge Hebbard had given his de
cision, Ruef said in an interview that he
might possibly seek a writ of review and
by that means take the case at once to
the SuDreme Court and get an early de
cision. .
"I have not "seen any other case but
this." said -Ruef. "in which the same in
aneness, the same imbecility as seen in
the -Mahony case is in evidence.'"
Ruef cited a Missouri case in which a
county officer was removed for ante-elec
tion pledges, and a Canada Supreme
Court case, in which a written promise
was given and the officer, a County Clerk,
was removed. Ruef said the case In 20
Canada Supreme Court Reports, page 376,
was a remarkable parallel to the Ma
hony case. There was a written promise
which was afterward burned, and there
was the same reluctance of witnesses to
testify. Â¦ â¢
Parallel Case in Canada.
"I will grant you this," replied
the court, "that for malfeasance, mis
feasance or nonfeasance in office, an
officer ought to be removed. I believo
that every officer ought to do his
duty and should, not' enter into such
contracts as are alleged here. But the
only question is, has the Mayor the
power to suspend the County Clerk, a
county ofncerP"
"You will grant, will you not,"
asked Ruef, "that if Mahony wera
guilty of larceny he could be suspend
ed by the JIayorP"
Judge Hebbard objected to what he
termed a moot proceeding, and Ruef said
he was willing to concede that the Mayor
intended to remove Mahony; in other
words, he was willing to accept the alle
gations of Mahony's petition.
The Mayor's counsel cited numerous
cases of removal of officers for malfeas
ance in office, the court repeatedly cut
ling him short on the ground that no mal
feasance was alleged in this case.
Ruef argued that if the court had juris
diction at all It was to stop the investi
gation, not to prevent the Mayor from
deciding upon the facts developed by the
investigation. He held that the writ of
prohibition was founded upon the as
sumption that the Mayor intended to re
move Mahony. when, as a matter of fact,
the Mayor's chief desire was to have the
courts pass upon the question at issue.
The Mayor's counsel argued that the
writ of prohibition was somewhat mixed,
as it did not appear whether the court
meant to prohibit, enjoin or restrain.
Court Objects to Moot Case.
Fourth â The Mayor is given power to sus
pend for cause and "cause" is any disqualifi
cation for office.
Third â The court cannot interfere with the
exercise of the Mayor's discretion when the
power of removal is expressly conferred.
That said affidavit of complaint does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action or to warrant the issuance of a writ of
prohibition herein, in this that. It does not ap
pear ' therefrom' that any objection .was ever
made to defendant that defendant had* no juris
diction herein, and it does not appear therefrom
that the alleged lack of jurisdiction on the part
of defendant was ever called to defendant's at
tention.
Ruef advanced the following points In
argument:
First â That the act attempted by the Mayor
was an administrative, not a judicial act.
Second â A writ of prohibition runs only
against judicial functions.
That said affidavit or complaint does not
state facts sufficient" to warrant or justify the
issuance of a writ of prohibition herein.
That said affidavit of complaint does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause for
action or proceeding herein.
Ruef replied that he did desire to file
an answer and also to take an exception.
The court answered that he had ten days

Now the Mayor, under the charter, is trying
to interfere with these county officers and he
has no more to do with them than I have not
so i much. Now what I say does not refer to
where there is a case before me in court But
this is a case to i>revent the Mayor from do

made it very easy and clear for me in these
three cases and especially in the case of Crow-

Xow the Mayor is attempting to interfere
with a county officer. A county officer is gov

to the charter makera the power- to fix their
term of office, the number of their employes and
the salaries which they shall have. But there

The courtâ Let me say, incidentally, that
the only authority you cited in eupport of your
case is the charter itself. You have net cited
a single other authority.
Mr. Ruef â I tried to get your Honor to al

Clerk a County Officer.
After hearing: argument I went into the mat
ter very thoroughly, and I wrote an opinion
and "decided that the 'Supreme Court of this
State had tcld me that the charter had noth
ing to do with the county officers under article
S^t of section 11. and the Supreme Court said
I was right.
About fifty years ago Horace Hawes framed
the- consolidation act. and that was the or
granic l&v ot this city under the authority of
the Legislature, with the acts amendatory
thereto, nntil a few years agt> when the char
ter was adopted. Just before the charter was
adopted the case of Kahn versus Sutro had
been decided, which set out. perhaps about the
first time In all those fifty years, the distinc
tion which the Supreme Court said existed be
tween the city and county of San Francisco
and other counties. In that case they decided
that there were county officers and city offi
cers. Then came- along; the case of Martin
against Ford, and the Supreme Court, I be
lieve. In that case said that the only thins
that the charter could do in relation to these
county officers was \jnder article 8Â»A of section
n. Then came along the case of Crowley
against Freud, a civil service case, in which
very eminent: counsel for Mr. Freud argued
to me that the Martin case decided nothing-,
that the Kahn case oecided nothing and that
the charter .provided for everything, including
the qualifications of officers in these so-called
county offices.
Following is the court's decision. in full:
When * Rjief completed his argument
Judge Hebbard said to Thomas D. Rior
don, attorney for Mahony:
"You need not reply. I am ready to give
my decision now and in a very few
words."
The hearing began at 10 o'clock and
lasted until nearly 12. During most of
that time Ruef was on. his feet making
his argrument on the points set forth in
the demurrer. Judge Hebbard repeatedly
admonished the Mayor's counsel to con
fine himself strictly to the question at Is
sueâwhether the Mayor holds the power
to suspend the County Clerk. The court
refused to listen to argument covering
ground gone over by counsel in the Crow
ley vs. FVeud case or to the citation of
cases in which the officer suspended or re
moved had been guilty of malfeasance or
other offense in office, instead of offenses
prior to assuming office, as was alleged
in Mahony's case.
Court's Frequent Admonitions.-
hony's complaint and petition for
a writ of prohibition restraining the
Mayor from suspending the County Clerk.
While the main questionâ whether or not
the temporary restraining order shall be
made absoulteâ was not passed upon, the
court's opinion embodied a decision of the
really vital questionâ that of the Mayor's
power or lack of power to suspend the
County Clerk for what he may deem suf
ficient causeâ and the decision was ad
verse to the Mayor's authority.
The hearing was had on points raised
by the demurrer filed by Abe Ruef, the
Mayor's 'attorney, and its overruling
leaves Ruef ten days to file an answer to
Mahony* s- complaint or to proceed along
other lines. Judge Hebbard's decision
leaves no doubt whatever that when the
proceedings have reached the proper
stare he will grant Mahony's petition for
an absolute writ of prohibition.
The effect of Judgp Hebbard's decision,
if it be upheld by the higher court, will
be to invalidate all those portions of the
charter which seek to give the Mayor the
power to suspend officers held by the
courts to be county rather than municipal
functionaries. . 'Â».-'Â¦'Â¦Â¦:

Ruef then read an affidavit sworn to

argument on the case. He claimed that
there had been no . disobedience of any

quently there could be no contempt.
Riordan interrupted Ruef by claiming
that the only question to be decided was
whether there had been a contempt of
court or not.
"I think-. the counsel has the right,"
Judge Cook said, "to discuss whether the
court exceeded its jurisdiction In ordering
the writ of review to be issued."
Ruef made an able argument to show
that even If the Mayor had no right to
suspend Williams the writ of review could
not be Issued against the Mayor or
against Powell Fredrick.
Holds Writ Is Invalid.
"The court Is not called upon to review
the acts of Fredrick," said Ruef, "in tak

proceedings of suspension of Williams by
the Mayor." . â¢ ~ : â¢*-'*'
Ruef argued that the court had no fight
in the writ issued to suspend a publics
officer, and could not restrain such officer
from doing his ' duty.
"All that the writ can do." continued
Ruef, "is to bring the record Of suspen
sion before the court for review. The writ
ordered certain parties to suspend further
proceedings in the matter to be reviewed.
Frederick has not proceeded further lit
the matter to be reviewed, but has sim
ply remained in office and discharged hia
duties. That portion of the writ suspend
ing Fredrick from his duties Is not with
in the Jurisdiction of this- court."
Attorney Ruef cited decisions to define
what acts are judicial and what are min
isterial and executive, and argued that
under these decisions the act of Mayor
Schmitz in suspending Williams was pure
ly executive and that a writ of review
could not issue.
At this stage of the proceedings Judge
Carroll Cook took a recess until 2 o'clock
this afternoon.
JUDGE CARROLL. COOK'S court
room was the center of attraction
yesterday in the matter of the sus
pension 'of Justices' Clerk E. W.
Williams by Mayor Schmitz and
. Â¦ the appointment by the city's chief
executive of Powel Fredrick to the posi
tion formerly held by Williams.
Peace- and quietness prevailed during
the day, at. the office of the clerk to the
Justices of the Peace. - Fredrick was on
hand and discharged the duties of the
chief clerk, while. Williams looked in for
a few minute's, but made, no attempt to
regain possession of the office.
There was a big gathering, of politicians
in Judge <|ook's court when the contempt
proceedings against.' Powel Fredrick was
called up in ; the afternoon.
Â¦In rendering his decision on the motion
to dismiss Â¦; the contempt proceedings
Judge Cook denied the motion and held
that the attention of the court had' been
called to the affidavit in. which it was
claimed that the writ issued against
Mayor Schmitz and Powel FredricK had
been . disobeyed. j
The contention of Attorney Ruef that
Fredrick was not called upon to obey the
writ because the complaint on which the
writ had been: issued was not properly
filed in the County Clerk's office was not
upheld by the . Judge. Judge Cook held
that the complaint was in the possession
of Deputy County Clerk Casey when the
court ordered the writ to issue and that
the deputy received instructions to file
the document in the County Clerk's office
and had done so.
Motion to Dismiss Is Denied.
"The evidence shows that the document
was on file In the County Clerk's office
when the writ was issued," said Judge
Cook, "and the clerk was acting under
the instructions of the court in issuing
the writ. Even if it had been a verbal
order it was an order of the court and
would have been valid. The writ was Is
sued under proper Jurisdiction and the
motion to dismiss these proceeding's is
denied."
The contempt hearing was then contin
ued until 7:30 p. m. and there was a good
attendance of City Hall officials and poli
ticians at night to listen to the proceed
ings.
Thomas D. Riordan appeared as attor
ney for Williams, while Abe Ruef repre
sented Powel Fredrick and the Mayor.
There were a number of little clashes be
tween the lawyers, but Judge Cook in
sisted that the attorneys Â¦ suspend
wrangling and get down to business.
Powel Fredrick was placed on the wit
ness-stand by Riordan and the witness
told how he had been appointed as chief
clerk to the Justices' Court by Mayor
Schmitz and had taken possession of the
oflice an .Tuesday last ut 5 p. m. The
witness then detailed that on Wednesday
morning he was served with the writ of
review issued by Judge Cook's order and
had been advised by the Mayor's secre
tary not \o pay any attention to it.
Attorney Riordan tried to get answers
from the witness as to "what right he
had to remove deputies in Justices'.
Courts and place others there, but the
court sustained an objection from Ruef.
E. W. Williams, who was suspended by
the Mayor, testified that he had been
chief- clerk of the Justices' Courts for
eleven years and told how he . had been
served with the Mayor's notice of sus
pension Tuesday evening. Williams fur
ther testified that on Wednesday morn
ing last the Mayor and Fredrick had
been served with copies of the writ Â¦ is
sued by Judge Cook.
Biordan Advised Mayor.
Williams admitted that when he was
suspended by Mayor Schmitz on Tues
day last he had informed the Mayor that
he would not recognize his > authority In
the matter.
Attorney Charles E. Snook, brother-in
law of Williams, testified to being pres
ent in the office of the Justices' clerk
en Wednesday when the Mayor's secre
tary came and Informed the police that
it was "the Mayor's orders that Williams
and , hl3 deputies be thrown out of the
office, upon which they were ejected.
. Thomas D. Riordan took the stand and
testified that' he had informed the police
and the Mayor's secretary that they
would be guilty of contempt of court
if the Mayor's orders were carried but,
the writ of review having been served on
the Mayor and Fredrick previous. to the
order to Â¦ eject Williams and his depu
ties. Â¦ . : . Â¦â¢'" â¢
"The Mayor's secretary, said 'that the
BOOKS TO BE EXPERTED.
Decision of Contempt Case.
Complications Arise Fending Court's
Cyril Williams, expert of the Board of
Supervisors, was instructed by the Mayor
yesterday to expert the books of E. W.
Williams, the deposed Justices* clerk. Ex
pert Williams began his work yesterday
morning and had waded through many
pages of records without discovering any
discrepancies. It Is not believed that any
shortage exists, but the Mayor is of the
opinion that In justice to the new cleric
the books should be experted to show
that the accounts are in proper shape.
Powel Fredrick did not meet with any
opposition when he entered his office In the
morning. Two stalwart policemen had
been on guard all night to forestall any
possible attempt on the part of Ed Wil-
Hams to take forcible possession of the
office from, which he was suspended by
the chief executive. The Justices of tho
Peace continued to recognize the author
ity-of Williams as clerk, and attsxesrted
to him that he open up another office in
the City Hall. Williams declined to do
this, because he did not desire to embar
rass litigants. He preferred to await the
decision of Judge Cook in the contempt
proceedings against Fredrick.
While Williams remains passive Fred
rick is performing the duties of his new
position, and all was peace and harmony
during the day. Fredrick was undis
turbed at the decision of the Justices of
the Peace not to recognize his authority,
and he continued to sign all papers. Very
little business -was done, however, and all
papers are presented to Presiding Justice
Daniels, who indorses them "Filed In open
court." The Instruments are then trans
mitted to Sheriff Lackmann, who will not
receive them unless they are so indorsed.
Another complication has arisen over
the fact that County Clerk Mahony -will
not recognize the Justices of the Peace
in th&, filing of processes for injunctions
The State law says plainly that such lrtr
struments shall be issued by the clerk .off
the Justices* Court, and on that . ground
Mahony claims that the Presiding' Justice
has no power to sign them. AH con
cerned seem to be waiting the decision
which will designate whether Fredrick or
Â¦Williams is . the legally constituted ' clerk
of the Justices' Court.'

Director Mark indignantly denies that
he is making an attempt to have himself
assigned to a vice principalship In the
event that his resignation is demanded by
Mayor Schmitz because of certain charges
of bias and prejudice in the cases of ac
cused teachers. . Mark says that he will
stand on his record and that he has al

Harry Lambert, for sixteen years purser
on the steamship City of Puebla, handed
his resignation to the officers of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company yesterday. His
reason for doing so was to accept a lu
crative position with the new firm of
Goodall & Bennett. The resignation of
this popular officer was receivecd with re
gret. Lambert was complimented on the
efficient services he has rendered the cpm
pany and a lengthy letter of recommenda
tion was given him and the company
wished him luck in his new position. The
Pacific Coast Steamship Company has
lost three popular pursers during the past
morth. Ed Nutman was lost In the Walla

many years on the Umatilla, resigned to

Captain Fraser found himself, in the

with the precious package intact. He
notified* the agents of the steamship that
he held the young lady's valuables and

on deck, took in the situation and seeing

3,500,000 lire ($675,500) for the purchase of
the Villa Borghese collection of pictures
and other art objects, the estimated valua
of which is 10,000,000 lire ($1,930,000). Prince

The Borghese gallery is regarded as be

ThÂ» British ship Pericles arrived yester
day from Caleta Buena with a cargo of
niter. She made the trip in forty-nine
days, which is ' considered swift sailing-.
Captain Henderson sailed his ship right to
her anchorage in the quarantine grounds,
beating- his way through the heads in the
teeth of a stiff northeaster. The British
ship Chlltonford. which came in about the
fame time, was obliged to anchor off Lime
Point. She. was towed In by the tug Re
lief. The Chiltonford was sixty-nie days
from Newcastle.
Pericles Makes Swift Trip.
The wind was'in fickle mood yesterday
and managed to keep things about the
harbor pretty well tuned up all day. At
noon it was blowing from the southeast
at the rate of thirty miles an hour to the
accompaniment of a driving rain. By 3
o'clock the sun was shining brightly and
the wind was blowing a twenty-four-mile
an-hour clip from the northwest. The
southeaster freshened up considerably be
fore the wind changed, and at 2 o'clock
every indication pointed to a lively gale.
Before extra moorings could be got out
by those in charge of exposed vessels
rude Boreas took a hand and in a. twink
ling the storm died out ana- the sun com
menced sopping up the trail of the morn
ing rainstorm.
The Wind in Fickle Mood.
lowdene will to-day commence loading- 650
unbroken mules for the sugar plantations
of Fiji. An enormous two-story mule
barn has been built on the Willowdene's
deck. Captain Sandal thought this made
the vessel topheavy and unseaworthy, but
expert opinion decided otherwise. The
master then resigned the command to his
first officer and was on the point of re
turning to England when the insanity for
Â¦which he is now being- treated made itself
manifest. . . " ,

Pretty little Ida Parker, who myste
riously disappeared about seven-- weelfs
ago while ., In the custody of Secretary-
Frank J. Kane of ; the Pacific Coast . So
ciety-for 'the' ; ; Prevention of Cruelty to
Children,- appeared as mysteriously as she
departed late yesterday afternoon She
walked into the office 1 of ex-Judge Tread-,
well at : 533 Kearny ; street and told him
who, she was. . She had ; an envelope in
her hand on which Treadwell's office ad
dress was written in pencil. >>
The , little eirl had evidently, been
coached aa to the story she was to tell.
She said that she and her mother had.
been visiting a lady on Stone street,-be
tween' Stockton and Powell, in August
last when Kane came into the house and
took her. away, although her mother cried
and objected. Kane took'her to the Ma
ria - Kip - Orphanage, -where 1 she . stopped
for a month,' and was ,. then taken to a
house in- the Mission. > She i was < there a
week artd was taken; to " the Girls'" Direc
tory, but "after being; there a month she
was, taken to Kane's office andÂ» put in
charge of a family who lived inthesamo
building. 'â¢ .'â¢.-: cv Â«.-.-
While in the Girls' LHrectory Mrs. Nel
lie Brown, whom she had met Jin .Stock
ton during the fair in 1900,* came -to visit
her.; She met Mrs. Brown outside Kane's
office the second day after she went there
and -Mrs.' Brown took her away "with her."
.They -went to Santa Cruz and remained
there' till three, days, ago, when they came
, to .this city. and went to live at a; house
on Mission-street,. but she did not know,
the location. Mrs. Browir saw-tne report
in. the papers yesterday morning of her
disappearance and took' her in the car
.yesterday, afternoon to- Treadwell's office.:
She said Mrs. Brown -had- a -husband
whom- she called "Johnnie."' and -he had
a red mustache. . -They- had ibeen-.very
kind to her, but she wanted to get back
to her father-: and; mother Jin Â¦Stockton.
Treadwell arranged to send; her home, to
Stockton by last night's boat. Â¦Â¦.Â¦ â¢ â¢- Â¦
She did not know Sadie Ward,- whom
her stepfather, Bert Parker/ suspected of
having abducted her,, nor did, she know
Mrs. Ed Dean, wife; of the engineer on
the steamer T. C. Walker, -nor any one
by the name of John Bresliri. Mrs. Brown
was not known to her parents, she' said.
She Said she met Mrs. Brown during the
fair.- She got bewildered In thecrowd and
Mrs. Brown showed her how to get home.
t She . is an engaging talker, but every
effort to get her . to describe minutely
where she had been stopping with Mrs.
Brown either here or in Santa Cruz
failed. ' She remembered; she said, that
her father, whose name was White, fired
a shot at her mother and was sent to jail.
Frank J. Kane, secretary of the Pacific
Coast Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, reveals ja. state of de
pravity that, if correct in all its' details,
is startling in the extreme, and he main
tains, consequently., that the mother of
the girl is not a fit and proper person to
have the custody of , Ida. . He ; gives data
and particulars which he says warrant
his action in taking, the child a,way from
Mrs. Parker. ' ...':.'

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
..Weare^too far.from the scene of the struggle'tq
undertake to forecast the result, bVt v it seems "certain
that next June either the News will suspend publi
cation or else the welkin above Salt Lake will ring
Vith^bridal-bells'every^day from : tlW time; when the'
first -Ju'ne.buds begin to- bloom untiKtl^y â¢ culminate
'P^ *ke ;â¢hiptuous roses of July. And here's good
luck; to them all: - 'Â¦;';'. "'. - : .'-; â¢Â¦'â¢. -, â¢:
: It might be supposed that in a case pf.'thisVkind'a
man not inclined to court might appeal to the courts;"
but no.' Such an appeal does not lie.* Even if it did
the ; recourse would be vain, forra Chicago Judge
i"? 1 decided that any man with $25 in; his pocket
is able to marry. There is nothing,. then, for the
News men to -do but J to go . forth and hunVup "a . girl
or a'new;.job. r " - ..- ;
Our report says that the' News,- in addition to em
ploying the number of men required to get out an
afternoon paper, operates also: a job office, a bind
ery and a bookstore.; It employs all told .about 100
men,. and it seems that a considerable .percentage of
them are notmarried nor are they, matrimonially in
clined. It is hard to hustle for a wife even when one
is . stimulated by the sweet, influences of rapturous
early love, but, harder 'still; to hustle when the -heart
is like lead and the pocket lighter, "than a bubble in
the moment when 'it is ready to burst at the slightest
touch. V Pity, then, the sorrows "of the Deseret men!
Trouble of course is. not infrequent in newspaper
offices, though as a rule there is less of it in such
places than anywhere else on this mundane globe,
except in the happy homes where love abides; but
never before in a newspaper office has there ever been
such trouble as. that which lurks within the 'pre
cincts of the News and haunts' the hearts of those
who work for it.
to the story that comes to us the cause
of the trouble is this: The I%eret News is the offi
cial organ of the Mormon churchin Salt. Lake, and
reefcntly a decree has gone forth from the church
authorities that all male employes of the News shall
be married by the close of next June or hand in their;
resignations. It is a case of "double or quit" with
a new significance. There is no wager about it and",
no chance -to win.
-
MUCH "of trouble and much of lamentation
there are in the office of the Deseret News-
So we learn from a Salt Lake dispatch. The
trouble cannot be remedied, by a strike nor by a
lockout; nor can it be dealt with by a board of ar
bitration. Therefore the lamentation is the more bit
ter and cannot be assuaged by swearing.
MARRY OR QUIT.
It will reem strange. to Americans that it is not
until'this late date that the Germans are learning. the
advantages of co-education. The practice - has be
come so fully established here we can hardly remem
ber that it was ever looked upon as a problem.
Similar resolutions are reported to have been
adopted by a convention of the public school teachers
of \Vurtemberg, and it was declared that' "for the
sake of a more advantageous organization of the
schools small communities should not found sepa
rate schools for boys and girls." Another repprt
states that from this time forth in Baden and Wttr
temberg girls will be admitted to the higher schools
for boys on passing the entrance examination.
A recent convention of the public school teachers
of Westphalia adopted a series of resolutions declar
ing strongly in favor of the co-educational 'system.
Among other things the resolutions stated: "The aim
of the public school is the. same for both sexes; al
though the talents of the sexes are different and re
quire different treatment, a one-sided cultivation of
them may easily create an unnatural chasm between
boys and girls, so it seems desirable to educate them
together; the habit of daily association with the op
posite sex tends to diminish the moral dangers of
growing boys'and girls^; and, finally, co-education is
the most natural system because it is most like the
education in the family." ,
FROM Germany, the United States has learned
so many lessons in the^work of education that
there is no little satisfaction hv knowing. '"that the'
Germans areÂ»learning also from us. The success of
the co-education of boys and girls in our public
schools has so favorably impressed many German
educators that they are now advocating the adoption
of the same system throughout Germany, and have
accomplished a considerable movement in that
direction.
CO-EDUCATION IN GERMANY.
Because none of these provisions are made by the
Jaw or constitution in behalf of our present Railroad
Commission we have now to. wait until the courts re
view the case. The issue is in their hands. They
have interposed a temporary injunction, and it is
their duty to bring the case to a prompt hearing.
Behind it all is the issue of the legal vigor and
power of the Railroad Commission. It is perfectly
plain that the railroads do not desire to ob
solete the commission. It can Mo them no
harm, since it is without power to enforce
its deciiions. -/The Supreme Court -of the
United States has decided that a. State Legis
lature may provide the means for regulating the rates
charged by common carriers, but it has also decided
that such regulati&n shall be 'judicial.; What is re
quired is that the Legislature create a judicial body
of first ic'tance, from which an appeal lies directly
to the court of last resort. .The law may limit the
delays of procedure. It may require an answer to the
petition within a given time, restrict the joining of
issues, cut off dilatory proceedings, and compel ap
peal to be taken or abandoned promptly upon entry
of the decision.
The result of the litigation is awaited with much
interest The reduction in the rate is so small that
it does not furnish adequate reason in itself for a re
sort to the courts by the two roads. Nor does it
seem of such importance to the oil producers as to
warrant the cost of litigating. But the volume of the
reduction is of the least consequence to all of the par
ties conceined. The principle" at stake supplies the
motive for pursuing the case to the Supreme Court
of the United States. The railroads contend that oil
must pay its share of the average expense of moving
all classes of freight. The producers claim'that oil
must stand alone and pay such charge' as defrays the
cost of moving it and a reasonable profit to the road.
As this nine-mile spur carried 2400 cars in Novem
ber, its annual earnings would exceed the entire cost
of its construction, and at the old rate the oil freight
earnings of the Southern Pacific on transportation
from Bakersfield points would amount to $1,500,000
per annum. The net reduction made by the new
rate, which is litigated, would be about $250,000.
Xhese figures are necessary to show the people first
the very slight cut in rates which has driven the*
railroads into the courts for redress, and second the
immenie magnitude of the California oil business.
1 he former rate was 42 cents per barrel between
Bakersfield points and San Francisco points. Afte r
a hearing and a rehearing a rate was fixed of 25
cents per barrel for the first 100 miles; over 100 and
less than 200, 31 cents; over 200 miles and less than
375 miles, 37 7-10 cents. The oil producers also
asked a reduction^ on switch charges for the nine
miles between the Kern River wells and * Bakers
field, the charge being $7 and $5 per car, according
to distance. This charge was cut in two by the
Commissioners* decision.
THE Southern Pacific and Santa Fe railroads
have taken the oil rate cases into the courts.
The Santa Fe has resorted to the Federal courts
and the Southern Pacific to the State courts in "prac
tically the same proceeding, as in either case the ap
peal means a permanent restraint upon the' State of
California, operating through its Railroad Commis
sion, in the matter of fixing a ra^e on the transporta
tion of oil from the points of production to those of
THE OIL CASES.
subject of which they know so little' and pi which the
Pacific Coast is forced to learn so much by the re
peated^ outbreaks of highbinders..
Fprtunately the long campaign of education on this
subject has done its work effectively so far as Con
gress is concerned. The exclusion policy will be
continued. General Grosvenor's statement, published
in The Call some time ago, gives assurance of that.
It will, however, be worth while for Eastern critics
to post themselves before' undertaking to discuss' a
Goethe has told us that among certain classes of
people "there is a stupidity against which the gods
themselves war in vain." The men who will not ad
mit that there are any considerable number of crimi
nals among the Chinese immigrants to the United,
States belong to that class, and it is hopeless to argue
with them. The assertion that Chinese do not add
strength, "to the ranks jof the v anarchists" is really
neat. Only in r Boston could it ever have been
thought out in seriousness or uttered without a grin.
' Here, for example, is the Boston Transcript
blandly saying: "Few. people are ''ready to admit that
whatever vice and immorality may exist among these
immigrants is a sufficient reason for putting up the
bars against them.. We know, 0% the other hand,
that the Chinese give us little trouble on the score of
crime; the free admittance of this race would mean
no danger of adding strength to the ranks of the an
archists. In this connection what higher ' tribute
to the law-abiding character' of the Chinese could be
paid than this statement, made in a communication
to the. Transcript by Mr." Yong Kay, general mis
sionary superintendent of the New England' Chinese
Mission: 'As far as I can ascertain, among the Chi

CHINESE AND CRIME.
Along v.ith the strengthening of the police it is to
be hoped we may also have a strengthening of the
backbone of:. the courts. It. has too often happened
that the courts, instead of aiding the police', in the
maintenance of law, have handicapped their efforts.
A few severely just sentences upon burglars, foot
pads and the rest would have a wholesome effect.
Moreover, there should be specially heavy sentences
upon those. who resist arrest. The officers who with
so much of vigilance, energy and courage are fight
ing the battle of the law against crime should not
be left unavenged by the law when one of them is
attacked or hindered in the performance of his dan
gerous duty.
It is time to, strengthen the police. Under the
charter it is permissible to increase the force to one
officer for every 500 inhabitants, with a captain for
every 100 officers, a lieutenant for every 50, a ser
geant for every 10, and as many corporals as the
needs of the service require. With our present popu
lation that apportionment permits the maintenance of
a force of upward of .900 men. .There is,, then,- no
reason why the force should be restricted to the
present inadequate. number. On the contrary, there
is every reason why ifshould be' at once increased in
strength until it "is" able to safeguard the city, and
hunt out the Criminals who are- prowling about its
streets and committing new crimes with each suc
ceeding night. Â¦ &pk : S&%
The'frequency with which robberies, burglaries,.as
saults and murders follow one another is appalling.
The danger that attends the wayfarer , in the streets
of San Francisco is almost as great as that recorded
of the cities of the middle ages. While the police are
watching in one part of a beat" footpads ply their
trade in another, and when a cry for help siimmons
the single officer who is in the neighborhood the
criminal gang meet him with a fusillade of bullets
and murder him.
Under such conditions an adequate guardianship
of the 'city is impossible. Every effort has been made
by. the police to fulfill its duty. That much is at
tested by the readiness with which the officers re
spond' to every alarm and by the number who have
fallen, like Officer Robinson, in the performance of
duty. By an act of the Legislature eight hours con
stitute a policeman's watch, .but owing to the emer
gency of the situation here it has not 'been -found
possible to limit a watch to that number. of hours.
The men are serving long watches as well as on : long
beats, and still the city is not guarded as it should be.
San Francisco .has "an area of approximately
forty-nine square miles, and the population at the
census of 1900 was 342,782. It contains about 750
miles of "streets. Were the present police force dis
tributed evenly throughout the area there . would be
about twelve officers" to the square- mile, and were
half of them to be on duty at a time each would have
to patrol about two miles and a half of streets and
look after a population of about 1200. The distribu
tion, of course, cannot be made in that way, for, Ut
must correspond to the comparative requirements for
police protection in the different districts. The re
sult is that in the -outlying districts the beats are so
extensive the officer has hardly time to make a sur
vey of them, and even in districts nearer the center of
population the beat3 sometimes extend from ten to
fifteen blocks on two streets, or an equivalent of
thirty blocks. \
T"7*Â¥ the. murder of Police .Officer Robinson 'the
Iâ V people of San Francisco have been startled
*â " into a consciousness of the dangerous eie-;
ments that exist among the criminal classes of the
city... It is not a question merely of hoodlums, or of
petty thieves, nor of unexperienced footpads who
would shrink from the shedding of blood.". 'It is an
issue of hunting Jown criminals skilled in, the use oÂ£
weapons, ready to resort to them, arid murderous by
instinct. To protect property,' person and life against
their assaults we have a police force of but 591 men.
It is .too small. ...â¢Â¦'. -
Upon the bare summary thus far reported from
Washington it is not possible to make a definitive
judgment, but the ve/y introduction of such a measr
ure is a matter of no little importance,' for it is certain
an earnest effort will be made to settle the banking,
problem at this session of .Congress, and the Platt
bill may prove to be a notable factor in the solu-*
- The principle involvedin the bill is by no means
hew. It has been under discussion ever since the agi
tation on the subject of reform in our banking? law's
began.; It happens, however, that there has never
been a. time when any showing could be made of the
strength back of it, so that it is not possible now to
forecast what will be -the fate of the new measure.
That it is introduced by the Senator,' from New York
would seem to imply, that it will prove, a formidable
competitor to what is known. as the "asset currency
plan," should it have been put . forwird for that pur
pose. It of course N goes without saying 'that should
it be enacted there would have to be very careful
supervision over the kind of State and county bonds
that would be used as a basis for the new notes. ..'",'
bonds. The amount of notes issued to a bank is re
stricted to 70 per cent of its capital stock; and they
are j to) constitute a first lien on the bank's assets:
The provisions for' inspection; and supervision . of the
banks by the Comptroller of the Currency are ; prac
tically similar to those for- national banks, /except
that the banks are' required to deposit gradually with
the Treasurer of the United States asum equal to 2
per cent of their capital â¢ stocks, which is to form a
safety fund for the redemption of.the notes of any
bank which may fail."

A delegation of citizens appeared before
the Supervisors' Police Committee yester
day to urge the passage of the proposed
ordinance which Is Intended to legalize the
selling . of pools on horse races within
track inclosures for a period not to ex
ceed sixty days in any calendar year.
The passage of the ordinance will make
possible the reopening of Ingleside race
track.
The reasons advanced by the delegation
were that large sums of money which
would otherwise be spent in* this city were
driven across the bay because Ingleslde
track was closed. It was . represented
that the interests of hay and grain men,
livery stable keepers, hotel keepers and
many other smaller artisans and smaller
business men were suffering because of
the crowds that were attracted dally
across the bay to attend the race meet
ings.
. Harry Brennan, who was the first to ad
dress the, committee, stated that he was
engaged in business which was placed at
a disadvantage because racing was pro
hibited in this city on account of the ordi
nance against poolselllng. Brennan stated
that much money was spent in Oakland
which would otherwise be spent in this
city.' Edward Lunstedt followed by mak
ing a plea that insomuch as racing Is per
mitted throughout California it should not
be stopped in this city. He explained that
the opening of Ingleslde was of vast im
portance, particularly to the people in the
central portion of the city. *
Peter Wlnegar submitted figures to show
that there was being expended monthly in
Oakland the sum of $98,000 approximately
for feed, attendants, leather goods, train
ers and shoetne, all of \ which would be
spent here If In&leside was reopened.
â¢ After the committee had heard the argu
ments Chairman Boxton asked if there
was any one present who desired to speak
In opposition to the measure. No one re
plied and the committee proceeded to take
a vote Â¦ on Its report. . Supervisor Curtis
said that he favored sending the ordinance
back to the board without recommenda
tion. Â¦ â¢ ;
- "This is a very important measure,"
said Curtis, "and I think Its merits should
be discussed fully in open board."
. Supervisor Egers favored ; that I action
betaken either for or against the ordi
nance. As Curtis and Eggers could not
agree. Chairman Boston deemed it advis
able : to. postpone action for one week,
which was done. . ... ,-.-Â¦:
The residents in the neighborhood of

oughly alarmed over the actions of three
footpads who are making themselves ob

and robbed Monday night about 7 o'clock
on Webster street, between Oak and
Page, and the following night about 9
o'clock Rev. Dr. Eugene A. Avery of the
Westminster Presbyterian Church, Pags
and Webster streets, was held up. . .
There was service In the church Tues
day night and Dr. Avery was the last
one to leave, except the janitor. He had
just stepped out of the church to go to
his home at 1102 Fell street, when three
footpads approached him. The tallest of
the two ordered him to throw up bis
hands. Dr. Averse, thought for a moment
they were joking and did not comply with
the demand, when one of them struck
him on the shoulder with a piece of gas
pipe.
Dr. Avery â¢ defended himself with his
umbrella and as there were three against
one, and the footpad was striking at him
with the piece of gaspipe, Dr. Avery
shouted for. help. His cries were heard
by Hugh Keenan, who lives on the cor
ner opposite, the church, and he threw
up the window of the room in which fca
was sitting. This frightened the footpads
and they ran down Page street.
â¢ The police have been notified bjr the
alarmed residents, who are arming them
selves so as to be prepared for trouble,
and the footpads may get more than they
expect if they continue their work in that
neighborhood. -

The trial of William Buckley on the

LOSES HIS LIFE
IN BATHHOUSE
lor's court yesterday. The first reference
to the late strike and the fact that Rice
was known as a "scab" was made when
Walter- B. Dexter, a machinist, was
called. Dexter was a fellow workman of
Rice and he was to testify relative to a
plot in 1 which it was said Buckley was
implicated to "do up" a "scab" on the
day of the murder. The testimony was
objected to by counsel for the defendant
as being too remote and in no way perti
nent to the issue. It was decided by the
court tP .defer the hearing of Dexter's
testimony until a later period of the trial
and until Buckley's connection with the
murder had been more clearly established
by the prosecution.
Little testimony of value was adduced
by the prosecution during the day. No
one was able to identify Buckley as the
man who fired three bullets into the re
cumbent form of Rice, but all agreed that
the shooter wore a hat of a light color.
This was regarded as a very material
point for the prosecution, inasmuch as
Buckley, who ran from the scene of the
murder, wore such a hat at the time, of
his arrest. .William H. Kidd, a machinist,
saw a man with a white hat run away
from the place of the killing, at Twentieth
and Howard streets. William Spiess, con
ductor, -and Charles Angelius, motorman
of the car on which Rice rode to his
death, testified that they saw the shoot
ing, but their memories were vague and
indefinite as to the man who committed
the crime. ' - . .
During the afternoon Frank J. Keveney
swore that the man who did the shooting
wore a light hat, but Â¦Â¦ when' Buckley's
hat was shown to him he expressed the
conviction that the hat worn by the as
sassin was of a lighter color. This was
contradicted by the testimony of Jabez
Swan Jr., who said that the murderer
wore a light brown hat.
The testimony of Edward D. Leahy, a
brass molder, who saw two men running
on Shotwell street, was to the effect that
one of the men wore a white hat, or if not
precisely that color it was in no sense
dark.
The prosecution will bring forward a
woman to-day who. it Is- claimed, will
positively I Identify Buckley as the man
who did the shooting. The case will go
on at 10 o'clock thfs morning.

Police Committee of the Supervisors
Directs Amateur Organizations
to Join Pacific Association. ?
The Supervisors' Police Committee
granted permits to, the Bay City Athletic
Club and the Yosemite Club yesterday for
amateur boxing exhibitions in January.
The.Bay City Club had been citedto ex
plain its suspension by the Pacific Asso
ciation of, the Amateur Athletic Union,
the committee holding that, under the
ordinance, any club not a member of the
association was ineligible to promote con
tests. - '
W. B. HInchman, president of the as
sociation, stated that the Bay City and
San Francisco clubs had been suspended
because they had given exhibitions with
out the sanction of the association -
W Dan Crowley and Alec Greggains testi
fied they had never received notice of sus
pensions. Several hundred members'
names had been sent to the association for
registration; -but their registration cards
had never been received. Greggains con
tended that his club had always tried to
live up to the rules of . the association
It was agreed that the clubs should con
fer with the association officers with a
view to their reinstatement. The Yo
semite Club was directed to Join the as
sociation. . â¢
The committee" granted the petition of
the Yosemite Club to give a professional
boxing- exhibition in February. The pe
titions of the National and Pacific Coast
clubs for the same month, were denied on
the ground that the Yosemite Club had
originally filed an application for January
but withdrew it and reflled one asking for
the February permit.
The petition of the Hayes Valley Ath
letic Club to" give a professional boxing
exhibition in March was laid over for one
week. - "

H. L.'Lewis, the new racetrack plunger,
literally made the bookmakers at Emery
ville track take in their signs yesterday.
All those who accepted bets from Riley
Grannan's successor ' quit the day loser.
Lewis won in the neighborhood' of $25,000.
On Wednesday he won' $15,000. He Is the
stiff est bettor at the racetrack and the
"bookies" dread him as they do a cross
eyed Chinaman.' . '- " " -Â¦Â¦'-'
The plunger has .been here four weeks
and declares his, winnings amount to
$67,000. He comes from New York and ac
cording to his statement has followed the
races since he wore knee breeches. He
does not trust to luck to win his bets. He
relies on his judgment, coupled with in
formation from the right source. When
he passes through the betting ring the cu
rious follow him and rely upon his Judg
ment In making their bets. He was the
cynosure of all eyes yesterday, being fol
lowed by scores of bettors who wagered
their money as he did.
Lewis won on every race but the last.
He intended to bet on My Reina in the
two-year-old event, but < changed his
mind and let It alone. She finished second.
He fcet on Dangerous Maid in -the last
event on the card. The Â¦ bookmakers
thought he was going to play Bathos; and
were prepared to lay him a short orice,
but he avoided it. He lost 5500 on "Dan
gerous Maid, which finished second.
He is the coolest man in the betting
ring. If he wins he shows no emotion.
If he loses he tears his tickets with a non
chalance that is remarkable. Lewis is a
plainly dressed Individual. He is short and
has a , budding , mustache. He says he is
31 years old. - In speaking of his winnings
at the track, Lewis said:.
"When I first came out here four weeks
ago I lost $4000. Since then I have won
dbout $67,000. I have been following the
races since I was a boy. My brother and
myself ran the Manhattan Stables years
ago. We had twelve horses and Willie
Doane, who is now a valet r- to Winnie
O'Connor, used to ride for us. I own Pom
pino and 'Marlon Lynch and expect to buy
three good two-year-olds. -
"Many people called me a 'sucker' for
the first two weeks, but they have
changed their opinion. I am not betting
wildly, but on good judgment."
Tim McGrath, Tom Sharkey's old run
ning mate, is. piloting Lewis about and J.
Judge is training his horses. See, the
jockey, has signed a contract to ride for
him the balance of the season.
Lewis Is generous to the jockeys who
have ridden horses on which he has
plunged. He is said to have given Johnny
Woods $500 . for winning on Moablna . on
Wednesday and a like amount for landing
John Peters i_ first yesterday. Lewis is
modest in this. matter, saying $100 is his
limit in such cases. '
THE CALL'S RACING FORM CHART.
Declares That He Has Won
Over $67,000 in a
Month.
pÂ»ypa HE books at Oakland received a
I fearful trouncing yesterday.. Al
5 though rain fell almost Incessant
il ly. and the track resembled the
stereotyped "sea of mud," favor
ites dropped in first just as figured, with
one exception. Nearly all of the pencfl
ers quit heavy losers on the day's specu
lating.
Nothing could get within hailing dis
tance of Nilgar, the even money favor
ite for the opening mile selling run, and
with Bullman in the saddle the gelding
won by himself. William F, a 20 to 1
shot, took the place, five open lengths In
front of Rushfields.
Marcato, from the Burns & Waterhouse
stable, opened favorite for the five and a
half furlong sprint, but as it became
known he was not up to much the price
went to fours. The smart ones unload
ed on Constable, and Ezell's gelding got
home half a length before the 20 to 1
outsider Berendos. Hilary, another out
sider, ran third.
Johnny Bullman had' the mount on
Adirondack, and although It was the
youngster's second appearance within
two days he acquitted himself admirably.
A t to 10 favorite, he led all the way,
teating Mi sReina a length. Jennie Mc-
Gowan, miserably ridden by Mounce, fin
ished third. .
A five furlong sprint followed, for which
John Peters was backed on! the boards in
the betting. The colt closed an 8 to 5
favorite and was never headed, leading
out Quiet three lengths. Dulcimer, the
Ryan entry, ran third.
Lewis, the plunger, forced the price
against Muresca from 9 to 10 down to
3 to 5, and "Frisco" Lind's fast mudlark
won all the way in the fifth number.
Huachuca once. looked to have a chance,
but the first choice was only loitering,
and drawing away in the run for the wire
downed Huachuca two lengths. Vasallo
ran third.
Ransch rode a misjudged race Oa Dan
gerous Maid In the closing number, or
the mare could have scored. After mess
ing It about he was collared and beaten
out a neck by Mounce on Diderot, the
fourth choice. Bathos was third.

KELL THE DANDRUFF GERM.
Or Your Hair Will Fall Out Till You
Become Bald.
Modern science has discovered that
dandruff is caused by a germ that digs
up the scalp in scales, as it burrowfe down
to i.he roots of the hair, where it destroys
the hair's vitality, causing falling hair,
and ultimately, baldness. After Prof.
Unn'a of Hamburg, Germany, discovered
the dandruff. germ, all efforts to find a
remedy failed until the great laboratory
discovery was made which resulted In
Xewbro's Herpicide. It alone of all other
hair preparations kills the dandruff germ.
Without dandruff, hair grows luxuriantly.
"Destroy the cause, you remove the ef-
fect."

of animation to the stock market to-day and
the balk of the email operations was confined
to a short list of stocks, which advanced Quite
etrongly from the influence of special causes.

points apparently on the expectation that it

led by Metropolitan Street Railway, continued
for a time to-day, but the whole group sue.

leadership of the market and late in the day
was advanced S% point* over last night's close.
An advance of ,10 points in the price of
the product and reports of an agreement at

raw sugar were accountable for that movement.

Broomhall reported renewed liquidation at
Liverpool.- ' - â¢ j
Chicago declined from 79%c to 78%c, but re
covered to 7914c. - The -weak openlngr was due
to disappointing cables, weakness of coarse
grains and the heavy selling of local traders.
Later on the recovery "was due to good export
sales at the seaboard and reports of insufficient
moisture in the Southwest.' Â¦ ...
Wires from Chicago to Bolton, De Ruyter
& Co. said: "There was heavy liquidation In
Wheat and Oats, the Southwest selling heav
ily. The Cincinnati Price Current reported ttfe
condition of the winter Wheat crop fair, but

"Improved Inquiry from interior markets has
Induced a stronger feeling among holders of
spot currants, and while no advance at the
moment Is noted the situation presents strons
features portending higher values on the finer
sorts. Wires received to-day from Interior
jobbers contain inquiries for considerable round
lots, both for 6pot and to &rri\-e, and while no
important transactions have culminated go far
as can be learned, there is no disposition
6hown to meet buyers' ideas below the quo
tations. In raisins at the moment California
loose and seeded show a fair interest, with
phces firm. We can hear of no sellers of
seeded under Sc for choice and 8VÂ«c for fancy.
Some holders ask up to 8%c for fancy in car
tons. We hear of no' large purchases on the
spot, the late speculative buying having had
a tendency to induce caution among sellers.
Stocks here are believed to be largely con
centrated. Coast advices indicate that the
differences between the Big Five and the as
sociation are etill unsettled, but it is inti
mated in a private wire that the Big Five
price will be 7%c for choice and Sc for fancy
in cartons f. o. b. In imported Valencia layer
raisins the market is firm at 7%c. with some
holders quoting 7%c. Cost to lay down is said
to be around the latter figure for further Im
ports. Sultana raisins show steadiness. In
prunes the feeling continues firm on the Bpot,
with a moderate jobbing Interest. Coast ad
vices report the market firm but unchanged at
the 3%c four-eize basis on new Santa Clara*.
Oregon prunes are steady. Apricots and
peaches are firmly held, the market showing
etrongw tone. In figs we note sales of around
1200 bags on the spot at full prices. Some
fcueiness is doing in cases within the quoted
frange." .
Mail advices from New Tork say
Dried Fruits in New York.

cays of salmon and fruits:
Salmonâ The market has opened wltn, a fair
amount, of animation, and a good buslnes is
locked forward to during the coming 6eason.

about 121.000 cases. a.e* compared with 190L.
â¬90,000 cases, and 1900. 6S0.O0O cases; and of

however. Amalgamated Copper showed some
strength on the growth of foreign demand for
raw copper. There are^ growing symptoms of
a plethora of money at all of the great centers
of capital. To-day's* reduction In the Bank
of England's discount rate was contrary to
expectation as large collections of taxes were
expected to deplete the London money market
at this time and it was thought to be necessary
to keep up the money rate in order to prevent
withdrawals of French capital. To-day's state
ment of the Bank of France shows such an ac
cumulation there as. to offer little Inducement
to call home capital, but Berlin seems the
center of greatest redundancy, as is shown by
the fact that Berlin has been buying bills in
the London money market and easing the dis
count rate, there, while in the very act of
subscribing sixty times over for the proffered
Government loans of $75,000,000, all of which
has not prevented a -decline In discount â¢ rates
at that center. There is a continued accumu
lation of money in New York also, but with
out the stimulating: effect on speculation which
is manifest at other great money centers. A
remarkable development in the situation here
is the fact that very large time loans running
into the millions of dollars are being nego
tiated at interior domestic pqints for New York
account.
There was continued activity among usually
quiet bonds and some striking gains were re
corded, but the market generally was Irregular.

LARGE I/OT OF PROPERTY
Several determined men. disguised in
women's garb, are nightly patrolling the
streets In the terrorized district, hoping
to decoy the fiend Into attacking them.
Special details of police officers are also
on the lookout for the miscreant.
Even after her terrible experience Miss
Davi3 refused to-day to remain at homs
and pluckily nerved herself for her cus
tomary routine In the office. Her mother
and sister appeared more upset by thÂ«
occurrence than did the victim. Mrs.
Davis eaid:
"Gussie staggered in here looking Ilka
a ghost. We were frightened half to
death at her shocking appearance and In
coherent ravings. It was a long time be
fore she could tell us what had happened.
I do hope this fiend will be caught. The
suspense of having him at large to com
mit these dreadful outrages Is terrible. I
am afraid that Gussie will yet suffer from
the shock to her riÂ«rves."
. The attack upon Miss Davis is the most
recent of a series of similar outrages that
have alarmed the residents on the west
side of late.
Residents Are Alarmed.
"I burst Into the house and then I
don't remember very well what happened
for a while. After I collected my senses
enough to tell them about it my mother
and sister notified the police.
"It was so dark that I did not get a
very clear look at the man. I am sure
he was short and dressed In a dark suit,
and he seemed to have a very small face,
ghastly pale. I feel positive that he was
not insane. He said nothing and made
no sound nor any attempt to strike me.
Just as the wagon came in sight we were
passing a barn and I noticed that one oÂ£
the doors was open. I think he must have
dodged in there when he saw the wagon..
"Part of the time I ran in the middle
of the muddy street and I was too fright
ened to pay any attention to the water
and mire."
"The first intimation I had of danger
was when I saw something move just at
my side as I passed the high fence. A*
I saw that it was a man straightening: up
from a crouching position by the. fence
I started to run, the man chasing me and
gradually gaining on me. Just aa it
seemed that he would catch me almost at
my own gate a wagon drove around the.
corner ami he disappeared as mysteriously
as he came.
Crouched in the Dark.
"I had a dreadful scare. It was all so
sudden and he was so terrible and silent
racing after me in the dark. It was HkÂ»
an awful dream with only the swift foot
falls to make it real. I don't know how
I ran so fast or how my strength held
out so long. There was nowhere to stop.
1 didn't see a light in any ot the housÂ«a
for those two blocks.
Miss Davis resides with her mother at
the corner of Thirteenth and West streets.
She came home from the .city as usual on
the 6 o'clock train, getting off at Seventh
and Market streets. It was dark and
rainy as she started to walk from the
station and she carried an opened um
brella. She saw nothing of her assailant
until ho sprang toward her from the
shelter of a high fence at Eleventh and
West streets, two blocks from her home,
and the grim race began in the darkness.
Miss Davis said:
Miss Gussie Davis, a stenographer In
the employ of the Missouri Pacific Rail
way in San Francisco, was attacked by
a mysterious man while on her way home
last evening and pursued for several
blocks.

The ranch is situated on the lino of the
Southern Pacific just over the Santa Lu
cia range. It Is watered by tho Salinas
River. Cienega, Rinconada and Santa
Margarita creeks,- all never-falling
streams. Along the northeasterly . slope
of the Santa Lucia range the rainfall is
the heaviest in the .county, and not even
In the dryest years has.it been necessary
to remove the stock from It.
Well water can be had on probably half
of the ranch at a depth of less than twenty
feet. It is remarkably well timbered with
pine, live oak and white oak. This, to
gether with the quantity of water on the
tract, was a strong factor in causing its
selection.

Crittenden, one of the gentlemen who ao
companled Generals Young, Kobbe and
Randall while these latter were examining
the various sites offered in thi3 county
for a military camp. Is" in receipt of defi
nite though unofficial information that the
committee, will recommend the beautiful
Santa Margarita rancho, some eleven
miles north from this city. It has been
understood since the visit of the commit
tee to this county that the. proposed camp
was to be located somewhere in this
county, but nothing definite was known.
The tract to be recommended has long
been famous as one of the most beauti
ful tracts in California. The surface is
varied, about 6000 acres are level, 4000 acres
are undulating and several thousand acres
range from hilly # to mountainous. Of the
20.000 acres required 18,300 acres are the
property of Ferdinand Reis, a capitalist
of San Francisco. Tho balance, will be
taken from the lands of J. H. Henry,
joining on the north. The price to be paid
is $18 per. acre. *
The Santa Margarita rancho until less
than a year ago was the property of the
late General P. W. Murphy. Shortly be
fore his death it passed into the hands oJ
Ferdinand Rels through its former own
ers inability to meet a mortgage of $145,
000 and advances.

At a meeting of the Point Lotos Im
provement Club last night a committee
was appointed consisting of George R.
Fletcher and Edward Ginley to wait on
the Board of Public Works requesting
that ncmes be placed on the street lamps.
The same committee was instructed to
urge the completion of the new Emer
gency Hoepitai which is being constructed
on Stanyan street. The neglected condi
tion of Fulton street, from Willard to
First avenue, called for paving of the
south side of that thoroughfare. Since the
improved condition of Point I^obos ave
nue, from Masonic avenue to the Cliff
House, has been recognized by the auto
mobile riders, this roadway has once more
come into public favor. During the last
year the ugly humps that made riding or
driving unpleasant have been leveled
down and ruts filled in with the material
thus removed. In addition to these im
provements the side street gutterways
have been deepened and cleaned out, af
fording sufficient drainage for all the
rain water that heretofore found lodg
ment in the hollows made by traffic.

The Chronicle contends that the suc
cess of American combines is not due to

capable and energetic management .ana
that Great Britain is pinning its faith to
a. system of monopoly without imitating
the energy which has worked' such won

THE Scots were out in such num
bers last evening that standing
.room was at. a premium at Odd
Fellows' Hall. The event was the
celebration of the birthday of
Robert Burns by Clan Fraser No. 78,
Order of Scottish Clans.
The hall was artistically decorated. The
walls were hung with red, yellowand pale
blue bunting, six large American flags
were suspended from the ceiling, while a
huge center-piece covered with pale blue
bunting .-and Japanese lanterns completed
the picturesque effect. AibÂ«
The ushers were members of the clan
and wore "cap and plaid.' 'as did the
whole clan, which marched. into the hall
to the rhythm of the bagpipe.
The following programme brought back
a fond remembrance of the "guid old days
in bonnie Scotland": \
ihe audience was a large one and was
silent until the reverend speaker culled
from his imagination causes to lay the
unchristian lash upon the Government
under which he lives and the govern
ments he lias read of. At those blatant
j>eriods. of course, there were many vcho.
Inflamed unto his ideas, applauded. But
it was not at all unexpected by those who
paid their 50 cents to hear him, since
many in the hall long before the lecturer
came upon the platform were heard to
say that they supposed the Rev. Mr.
Yorke would have "something hot to
say."
Those who paid the admission fee for
such sÂ»n exhibition were not disappointed,
for the Rev. Mr. Peter C. Yorke let his
furnace doors fly open and the hot
pparks flew from San Francisco to Porto
Rico, thence to Washington, over to
Cuba and spluttered across to Africa.
The address was sensational enough for
those who fancy that method of dema
gogic utterances, and therefore those who
paid their money for the pleasure or ex
citement of hearing denunciation in its
bitterest form were amply repaid
There was little, if arty, real logicâ only
the logic known perhaps alone to the Rev.
Peter C. Yorke. If he denounced govern
ment, whether home or foreign, it was
done with an intemperance of speech and
a style of declamation peculiar and famil
iar to the demagogue. Thus the tirade,
the wild oratory, the inflammable utter
ances and the wholesale denunciations
were the features of what was announced
to be a lecture bearing the Innocent title.
*ily Brother's Keeper."
Cnfler the j>retext of delivering a lecture
entitled "My Brothers Keeper," the Rev.
Peter C. Yorke delivered himself of an
outpouring of vituperation against the
Government of the United States at Met
ropolitan Hall last night which was start
ling, to far as his declaration that where
Spain killed one human being in the Phil
ippines. America, which went to those
islands to introduce liberty, killed twelve
and burned homes and robbed, while her
men committed other depredations of a
terrible character. It was in the same
etrain that the reverend lecturer wildly,
unphilcsophically and at moments slangiiy
let loose tiis very own. original ministerial
ideas of reasoning. In dealing with local
Batten he was no ltss venomous, lack
ing that moderation which is expected
from one of his cloth; evidently, too,
thoughtless of that Christian forbearance
whicli is usually and should ever be char
acteristic of the speech and the reasoning
of the Christian teacher.

Lewis was advised to appeal to the
board for an additional appropriation out
of the urgent necessity fund, and this he
will do.
The bills had been rejected because
they exceeded one-twelfth of the yearly
appropriation. Lewis. explained that the
reason why the inmates of the society
had increased was that Judges were loth
to send young criminals to the reform
schools and in consequence recommit
ments to the society's home were fre
quent.
Lewis claimed that the sum of $500 per
month which had been appropriated was
insufficient.
Superintendent -H. W. Lewis of the
Boys' and Girls' Aid Society informed the
Supervisors* Police Committee yesterday
that seventy-five youthful criminals
would be turned loose on the city streets
unless the city would pay the bills for
their maintenance which had been pre
sented to the board.

The fifty-second annual convention of
the Episcopal diocese of California,
which meets in St. John's Church, Fif
teenth; street .and Julian avenue, next
"Wednesday, is . expected to be the
largest in the history of the de
nomination. Especially Important leg
islation^ Is, to be considered, and
events of great moment to the well-being
of the church are likely to occur. The list
of delegates embraces men and women
from every part of the jurisdiction who
are known not only for their prominence
in their own denomination but from their
philanthropy as well. The body will in
clude many who are distinguished in the
social life of the State. Tne following ia
a list of delegates:
The report comes to the Gage camp that
Dr. Pardee. over the bay in Alameda
County, is diligently engaged in the work
of lining up a solid delegation for himself.
The Democrats of Los Angeles regard
Washington Dodge of San Francisco as
the man best fitted to lead their party
in the next State campaign. Singular as
It may peem the San Francisco Demo
crats, and notably the Iroauois warrior*,
look upon Mayor Snyder of Los Angeles
as one possessing the ginning qualities of
leadership. In the country the Democrats
talk of Beamer and Jeter.
What would happen if the Republicans should
nominate a vote-gftter like Ed Colgan to run
agaiim Beamer?
What would happen if tlio Democrats should
nominate a vote-setter like Dick Beamer to
run against GaBÂ«??
The question was answered by the ask
ing of another:
If Gage gets the Republican .nomination
for Governor there will be a legion of
Democrats ready to run against him.
Democratic politicians assert that he is
the easiest mark in sight. A Republican
at the Palace Hotel yesterday asked, this
question:
Legion of Democratic Candidates.
Governor Gage's supporters assert that
the talk of Flint's strength in South
ern California is all moonshine, but
there seems to be a difference of
opinion on this topic. It is a
significant fact that in the news col
umns of the Los Angeles Herald that a
Flint Club was organized recently in the
Second AVard of that city. Thirty charter
members signed the roll. The avowed ob
ject of this club is to advocate and work
for the. election of Thomas Flint for Gov
ernor. R. G. Livingston was elected pres
ident and Charles Wilde secretary. A. C.
Day and C. F. Shilling were elected vice
presidents. It is up to the Gage men now
to put a counter organization into the
ileld of the sunny south. State Senator
C. M. Belshaw. who Is journeying hither
from Washington. Is about due in Los
Angeles, where he oroposes to tarry for
a while. It is said that Senator Flint
will meet Mr. Belshaw in the City of
Ansels and the two Senators will listen to
suggestions from ex-Senator Bulla. It
would not be surprising If Flint, Belshaw
and Bulla dismantled some of the fence*
recently mended by Dan Kevane and
Walter Parker.

O3? TTTTTTRTRST TO PEOPLE
OF THIS PACIFIC COAST
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 23.â The general
rain predicted -for Southern ' California
reached Los Angeles at 10 o'clock to-night
and at midnight continues in gentle show
ers. Conditions have been favorable for
rain the past twenty-four .hours and hope
is expressed that the long dry spell will
be effectually broken in the next twelve
hours. Clouds have hung over the moun
tains all day and occasional breaks
showed Mount Lowe and, the surrounding
peaks white with snow : which * extends
well down ; toward ( the valley.
SANTA BARBARA, Jan. 23â A gentle
rain . Â¦ commenced about " sundown Â¦ this
evening, with every indication : of con
tinuing ( throughout the â¢ night, r. A. -. good
precipitation is greatly needed to save
the grazing on the stock-ranges through
out the county. : As yet no grain has been
planted owing -to. lack of. rain.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan: 23:â Since the rain
of last Wednesday morning the weather
here has cleared off and the temperature
has moved up several degrees. There is
no indication of a further precipitation in
this vicinity at present. '
. FRESNO, Jan.;' 23.â Rain began falling
at 5 o'clock this evening and at midnight
the. . precipitation continues. < Conditions
are reassuring for a moderately heavy
downpour. The rain: will be beneficial to
wheat and " feed and will stimulate plow
ing in certain sections. ( ,
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 23.â A heavily over
clouded sky and south winds give prom
ise of rain in this section, but during the
morning there have been only slight driz
zles. Reports from the back country are
to the same effect. >. . "
SANTA ANA, Jan. 23.â Rain clouds have
been hovering over the Santa Ana Val
ley ever . since the shower of â¢ Wednesday
morning and the indications are .excel
lent for rain to-night. A good rain would
be of immense advantage to the ranchers
of this'county.. . '
Prospect in the South.
GERMANTOWN, Jan. 23.â Never before
wkere the prospects of an abundant Â¦ har
vest better - ; in Glenn County than now.
Rains have been- favorable, cold weather
has lessened the likelihood of the too
early blossoming of fruit trees and an
other opportune rain began falling this
morning. It was intermitting during the
day ana still continues. . The season's
rainfall to date is 6.2 inches, against 5.5
to the same date last season. .
JAMESTOWN, Jan. 23.â Light showers
have fallen throughout this section this
afternoon. The precipitation up v to C
o'clock is .15 of an inch. Strawberry,
thirty-five .miles above here, reports six
inches of snowfall up to the same hour.
The indications 'are- for' a continuance of
ihe storm. to-night. Â¦
MODESTO, Jan. 23.â Rain began falling
at "noon to-day and kept up steadily all
day. At 7 o'clock this evening the fall
was a quarter of an inch. Indications are
favorable for a continuance. Crops In this
Immediate section were not suffering, but
on the west side of the San Joaquin River
there was very much need of rain. The
present storm will add to the reserve
moisture and encourage all who feared a
dry year. â¢ . . ,â¢ -^
Fear of Drought Ends.
Snow fell from Redding to the Oregon
line with increasing severity toward the
northward. At Weaverville and all over
Trinity County the snowfall began
"Wednesday night- and is heavy.. It is a
boon to the miners, who need . water.
Towns south of. Redding report no snow,
but rain is falling steadily. It Is wel
comed by the farmers. Â¦ â¢
REDDING, Jan. 23.â The first snow
flakes to fall in Redding since'the opening
days of 1901 began at 9 o'clock this morn
ing. The fall increased and the flakes
grew larger. For. an hour it snowed
heavilyj .then intermittently. . The i wet
ground caused the s'nowffb melt rapidTy.
The. snow ceased at noon and rain drla
zled all afternoon. A heavier snowfall Is
expected to-night. . .-Â¦-:Â¦
GRASS VALLEY. Jan. 23.â The first
snow this winter began falling here this
morning. Â¦' For a time big flakes came
down thick and fast and indications
seemed good for a big storm, ",but the air
was not cold enough and the snow, melted
almost as soon as it fell.' At 1 o'clock
the -enow was ! still falling, but slightly.
The atmosphere is growing colder and the
appearances are good for more snow. A
big cold snowstorm would be . welcomed,
as the higher Sierras are almost bare and
mining men are dubious over the outlook
for the water supply for next summer.
J.MERCED,. Jan, 23.â Rain began; falling
here early this evening, and at 9 o'clock
about half an inch had fallen, with the
prospect of a continued downpour during
the night. Owing. to the particularly fa
vorable season for putting in grain an
increased acreage has been sown in this
section and the present rain will prove in
calculably beneficial -to the crop, espe
cially to the late "sown grain. The need
for rain had become somewhat pressing.
SANTA - ROSA, Jan. 23.â Despite Â¦ the
predictions of the weather clerk, which
scheduled fair weather and light westerly
winds, a heavy, storm set in this morning
and 'continued all day. The total rainfall
to date is about ten inches, compared to
nineteen Â¦ inches last year at this time,
but vegetation is in splendid shape. Dur
ing the day almost an inch of water fell.
MILTON, Jan. 23.â A light rain com
menced falling here at noon to-day, and
with the sky heavily overcast and a brisk
wind from the 1 southeast a generous
downpour is Â¦ looked for. The present
storm is timely, but at the same time
grass ! and grain were not suffering for
rain in this vicinity and both stockraisers
and wheat growers report prospects ex
ceptionally good for this season of the
year. '
TRACT, Jan. 23.â The farmers are re
joicing. The finest rain of the season .is
in progress, .50 of an inch having fallen
up to this evening. Indications are good
for a continuance. Feed ~ has suffered
more than grain. This rain will benefit
all | feed and stockmen , are happy.
STOCKTON. Jan. 23.â The long-looked
for rain has come at last. Shortly before
noon . to-day it began falling, and there
is every . indication that a - protracted
storm is to ensue. It comes at a time
when it will be of incalculable benefit to
the farming interests. The Btorm contin
ues to-night. .... - - - - , . :
..SACRAMENTO, Jan. 23.â Rain com
menced falling * here at 10 o'clock this
morning.â. There was a good downpour,

OAKLAND, Jan. 23.â John Q. Glenn,
brother of A. G. Glenn, who resides at
1311 Twenty-seventh avenue, Fruitvale,
said to-night: "1 have not the slightest
idea why my brother should try to end
his life. The news is a terrible shock
to. me. He wired me Tuesday asking how
the family was and saying he was not
feeling well. His wife received a letter
Sunday that was cheerful, and saying he
expected to arrive home on February 1.
He had no business nor family troubles
so far as I know."
About 7:30 o'clock to-night a message
arrived at the hotel for Glenn from a
friend, and when one of the hotel mes
sengers knocked at Glenn's door he re
ceived no answer. On the door being
opened Glenn was found standing near
the washstand in his night clothes. His
throat showed a deep gash. A jack
knife covered with blood was lying near
him. Medical assistance was at once se
cured, and in the interval that elapsed
Glenn was heard to remark, "I did this
to get out of trouble." -
Glenn arrived* at the hotel Tuesday. He
spoke to several guests regarding fancied
troubles and complained that various peo
ple were talking about him. To-day
Glenn's behavior had not improved, and
in the course of the afternoon his friends
called in a physician, who administered
medicine to his patient and advised him
to go to bed. This Glenn agreed to do,,
and was then left In his room.

that the remaining ".two and much sought
for birds had flown.' The trio 'of murder
ers lived in four 'housekeeping rooms at
203 Turk street. 1 ' There they' ate and slept
and plotted their .'foul deeds., It was the
first place the two murderers who es
caped made tracks for when they hurried
away from the scene of their . terrible
crime. .The police had hoped to. find th*.
pair se'ereted in the house, but'one glance
at the tumbled interior of the rooms was
enough" to convince them that -"Kid"
Goucher and "Brownie," < who were impli
cated with Jack Wade, alias Henderson,
alias ' Daly, had taken a hurried depar
ture-after their return from their , das
tardly night's work in the. Mission.-' They
evidently knew that Wade had fallen into
the hands of the police and that the re-'
lentless. detective would soon be
seeking out their lodgings. On' the very
night of the murder Goucher,- "Brownie"
and another member of the desperate
gang of crooks packed up their odds and
ends of property and skurried'to safety
under the cover of darkness. \
The only tangible bit of evidence found
in the rooms by., which the police can
trace the murderers was a letter ad
dressed to William Coffman, 203 Turk

Senator George G. Goucher, formerly of
this city. Young Goucher was reared in
this 'city, and was always spoken of as a
hard character. Â¦ He was addicted to petty
thieving, but was * never in any serious
trouble here on account of it. He grad

afterward his father sent him away, and
little is known of his record since. It is
stated that Goucher subsequently went to
Texas. Afterward he returned to Califor

where he was employed as. a bellboy in
the Victoria Hotel. He was. in Fresno

The story of Wa,de's confession, which
was exclusively published in yesterday's

minds of the police that "Kid" Goucher,
a degenerate son of ex-Senator Goucher
of Fresno, and "Brownie," a notorious
crook, were the men implicated with
Wade in the murder of Policeman Robin

tailed Detectives' -Hamill and Fitzgerald

record in that county.

there. Detectives Fitzgerald. and Fisher

Bair at one time conducted a restaurant
at Tenth and Howard streets, but did not
make it pay. He turned it over to a man
named Hess, who ran it for a year, paid
Bair's debts and then sold it out. Bair
during this time did nothing, but appar
ently had no lack of ready coin.
"Occasionally he would borrow $20 from
me. said Owens yesterday, "and he
would tell the day and the hour when it
would be returned, and he always kept
his word."
In July. 1900. Henry E. Perry, an inti
mate friend of Bair's, was arrested on a
charge of passing counterfeit half-dollars.
Bair was at this, time playing the races.
Perry lived at the corner of Howard and
Grand streets with a woman named Mrs.
Jewell, who was suing her husband for
divorce. Bair is said to have been early
advised of Perry's arrest and to have con
veyed the information to Mrs. Jewell be
fore the secret service officers could
search the house. When they called and
searched the Perry residence they found
nothing incriminating.
Perry was convicted in September, 1900,
but refused to disclose the names of his
associates. Bair at this time also came
under suspicion, but steered clear of any
entanglement, perry received a sentence
of two years in San Quentin on Septem
ber 22, 1900.
Bair soon afterward moved over to Oak
land and purchased a cottage. Where he
got the money to do it is a question those
intimately acquainted with him are un
able to answer. One night during the ab
sence of Bair and his wife the cottage
was totally destroyed by fire. For some
time the insurance companies resisted the
claim, but finally settled with Bair for
$2500. With this as a nucleus the cottage
at Fruitvale, in which he last resided, was
erected.

About this time Bair commenced play

down to Palo Alto for a. time, and in a
year or so returned to the city. Then he
began visiting the poolrooms and cigar
stores where pools were sold and plunged
heavily, always paying his bets in silver.

GASHES THROAT,
SEEKING DEATH
E. C. Voorheis of Amador County, pres
ident of the California estate Miners' As
sociation, and I>. E. Aubury, State Min
eralogist, are sending out letters to kin
dred associations throughout the Pacific
Coast urging that Congressmen should
apply energy in support of the Woods
bill. Word comes from Washington to
the effect that California's representa
ti\ es, who were expected to take the
leading position in support of the propo
sition, are somewhat lukewarm. The in
cident is recalled that Senator Perkins in
addressing the State Mining Association
two years ago remarked that the bill to
create a Cabinet Secretary of MineS and
Mining would not pass, but that -the of
fice of Commissioner might be conceded.
At that time a well known State Sena
tor, who is an eloquent â¢ advocate of the
mining industry, declared that the bill
â¢would pass if the miners firmly adhered
to their purpose. Pointed reference was
made to the indifference of the United
States Senator. It is now the purpose of
the mining men to bring into line the
friends of the measure in every State and
Territory of the Pacific Coast. Consider
able reliance is placed on ' President
Roosevelt's friendship, as it iis known
that he comprehends the magnitude and
importance of the aggregated mining in
dustries of the country.
The States directly interested in the
proposed new department are California,
Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Utah, Ida
ho. Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Kansas, Texas, Missouri,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia
and West Virginia.
States Interested in Mining.
Early in the present session of Congress
Representative Samuel. D. "Woods lntro
"duced a bill providing for a new Cabinet
officer to be known as Secretary of Mines
and Mining. A bill is also , pending to
establish the Department of Commerce
and to provide for a Secretary thereof.
There seems to be some opposition to the
proposed mining department. The Direc
tor of the United States Geological Sur
\ey fancies that the importance of his
position might be diminished if the
"Woods -bill should become' a law. It is
the impression that the Interior Depart
ment officials are not favorably inclined
toward the establishment of a department
of mines and mining.
The opposition has spurred the mining
men throughout the country to renewed
effort in support of the Woods bill. Fig
ures are produced to show that the min
eral output of the United States in 1900
approximated $1,700,000,000. This includes
the value of coal, iron and oil as well as
gold, silver and copper.

but they yielded readily to treatment and
until up to a few days ago Judge Noyes
was reported *by Dr. Clough as getting
along as well as ' could be expected con
sidering the seriousness of the case.
On last Monday afternoon, however,
without the least premonitory symptoms,
the Judge was attacked by a very severe
hemorrhage. He bled profusely and it
was feared at that time that his end was
near. When the flow of blood was finally
stopped Judge Noyes was greatly weak
ened. On Tuesday he was removed to
Mount Zion Hospital.
Owing to the great strain which Noyes'
system underwent during the recent pro
longed contempt trial he is In poor con
dition to withstand the ravages of disease.
His wife is with him at the hospital and
everything possible is being done to pro
lone his life.

Almost everybody's digestion is disordered
more or. less, and the commonest thing they
do for It is to take 'some one of the many so
called blood purifiers, which in many cases are
merely, strong cathartics. Such things are not
needed. 1 If the- organs are In a clogged condi-
tion, they need only a little help and they,
will right themselves. Cathartics irritate the
sensitive : linings of the stomach and bowels
and often do more harm than good.
Purging Is not what Is needed. The thing
to do is to put the food in condition to be
readily digested and assimilated. Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets do this ' perfectly. They
partly digest what is eaten and give the
stomach just the help it needs. They stimu-
late the secretion and excretion of the diges-
tive fluids and relieve the congested condition
of the glands and membranes. They put the
whole digestive system* in condition to do iti
When , that is done you need take no
more , tablets, ] unless you eat what does not
agree with you. Then take one or two tab-
lets â give them needed help and you will have
no trouble. } Â¦
'It's a common-sense medicine and a com-
mon-sense treatment and It will cure every
time. Not only cure the disease but cure the
cause. Goes about It in a perfectly sensible
and BCientiflc way.

you and they have done their work well In my
case, for I feel -like a different person alto-
gether. I don't doubt if I had not rot them I
should have been at rest by this time."
H. E. Wlllard, Onslow. la,, says: "Mr.
White of Canton was telling me of your Dys-
pepsia Tablets curing him of Dyspepsia, from
which he had . suffered for eight years. As I
am a 'sufferer myself I wish. you to send me

am now entirely cured and enjoy life as I
never have before. â¢ I gladly recommend them.""
