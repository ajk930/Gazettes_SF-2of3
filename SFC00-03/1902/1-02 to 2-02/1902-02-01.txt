While the theory of a possible collision between the -lost Matteawan' and the
Condor has been. advanced, it is far more likely that the warship was swamped
by heavy seas and foundered during v the storm off Cape Flattery. On the night
of December 3 the gale blew .with terrific violence from the southeast, and-at the
'same X time there was i a ' heavy . southwest - swelli ' making a confused sea which
'would be dangerous to a well-decked vessel' of the class of the Condor. If her
decks filled,: as .they would when. she labored In such a storm, the large well deck
.would hold several tons of water, which would prevent her rising to meet the
.'next high sea which might sweep aboard. 'Then, too, the heavy guns might have
;broken from their lashlngs'and rolled about .the eve"r tilting decks.
'.-.''y.- ICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 31.â The i arrival ;of the Grant and Egeria from the
' / west coast is being awaited: with considerable Interest, for.it Is probable
/- they will ! have found along the VAncouver Isl*nd coast, the graveyard
Wr of the Paciflc, some tangible evidence of the fate of the missing war
* T ship "Condor." The Egeria Is bringing back the boat picked up, near
. AhoUjSett. by Indians. ' . '
This boat; which may be the only thing belonging to the Condor given up by
the sea; was evidently swept from its lashings on the warship by the high seas.
Naval men say the fact that the iron gripes were still in place shows that the
sailors did; not, have time to launch the 5 craft, for had they done so the gripes
would have been removed. The boat, without doubt, -was carried â¢ away from Its
lashings, which are securely fastened when the .warships leave for sea.

But even should they refuse to enter the

One thing Is certain, shippers of grain,

to pay the increased charges demanded

that some of the German, companies may

So far as could be learned t.o-nicht no
pooling of interests regarding passenger
rates, eithor cabin or steerage, has been
discussed, but with, the establishment of
this vast community of Interests as re
gards freight charges, some other and
perhaps cioscr alliance Is confidently pre
dicted.
Although, denied, by every" agent, who
was Questioned to-day, this agreement re
garding rates' ( li general.y .believed to
have been directly connected with the re
cent arrival here of several 'foreign repre
sentatives of various lines. These came by
the White Star liner C^ltica week ago,
and ever since their embarkation" at Liv
erpool the cables were kept . busy with
rumors as* to what was bringing so many
of them to v the country at the sarie time.
These denied to-day that their api---. ranee

fact that this new pool should have been
formed so soon after their arrival.

Essential Object \ of Revision.
The facts In connection with the com
mercial negotiations are given In the re
port of Rockhill, as Special Commissioner
to China, an advance copy of which was
obtained for The Call to-day. It is ex
pected that the commercial treaty will
also contain a provision for the abolition
of the llkin octroi and a new adjustment
of taxes. Certainly an effort to secure
the assent of China to such a provision
v.-lll bÂ« .made- The attitude of Secretary
Kay has not changed regarding trade
between the United States end China, as
Ltated 1n his instructions sent some
u.ontlis ago to Rockhill as follows:
The foregoing provision Is so Iron-clad
that Secretary Hay is confident that it
will enable the United States to enjoy
the same rights and privileges of what
c\-er character as may be accorded to
ether nations. As a result of the diplom
acy of Secretary Hay, this Government
obtained declarations from all the powers
in 1S33 and again during the Boxer revolt
recognizing the "open door." but the pro
vision which it is proposed to incorporate
in the projected commercial treaty will
make more difficult the evasion of this
principle.
"That whatever privilege, exemption,
benefit or advantage that is already or
may hereafter be conceded by China to
official representatives or to merchants,
subjects or citizens of any other country
In respect of their persons, property,
rights or occupations shall be at the
same time extended to Ufce "official" repre^*
centatives. merchants and citizens of the
United States; that the lowest Â¦ rates of.
duties or charges imposed upon personal
property cr articles of international com
merce of any foreign national origin shall
be immediately applicable to a like arti
cle of United States origin, and no other
cr higher duties, charges, burdens or re
strictions of any kind shall be imposed
on exports of the United States than
those imposed upon exports of the most
favored nation. All privileges, rights, ex
tmptlons and benefits now or hereafter
accorded by China to vessels of any other
foreign nation or to their cargoes or.offi
cers and crewÂ£ shall be equally enjoyed
by those of the United States. It' is fully
understood by both high contracting par

!s dying in the jail at Butler; John Biddle
is riddled with . buckshot and in a pre

Soffel is lying in the hospital with a self
inflicted bullet wound in the breast. This
fs the sequel of the sensational -escape
of the Biddle brothers from the Allegheny
County Jail, aided by Mrs. Soffel, wife of
the jail warden, on Thursday morning.
The" close of the Biddle tragedy cama
at '5:43 o'clock this afternoon In a snow
covered road,* two miles east of Prospect,
Butler County, near Mount Chestnut. The
exact place was at McClure's barn, where
two double team sleighs, filled with eight
officers, three of them Pittsburg detec
tives, John Roach, Albert Swlnehart nnd
Charles McGovern, met the two Biddies
in a one-horse sleigh, stolen at Ferrys
ville, and at once opened fire on the trio.
. Biddies Return the Fire.
The Riddles returned the f.re after
jumping* out of the sleigh. Mrs. Soffel
was shot in the breast. Edward
Biddle was shot in the left arm, in the
breast and In. one leg. John Biddle was
riddled .with buckshot in the breast and
head.
c The Pittsburg officers were met at But
ler^thls " afternoon' by Deputy Sheriffs
Rainey and . Hoon and Officers Frank
Holliday and Aaron Thompson, the latter
under command of Chief of Police Robert
Ray v of Butler.
The officers were certain that they were
on right trail and it was only a question
of time when they would overtake the
escaping condemned murderers and their
.guilty companion. .-
The Biddies and Mrs. Soffel ate dinner
at J. J. Stephens, at Mount Chestnut, five
miles east of Butler. /They had made a
detour of the town of 'Butler and after
going seven miles east turned north and
then went west. The Pittsburg officers,
only . a few miles in the rear, took tho
wrong. road for about eight miles, but
when they, found thelrmi3take they mado
up lost time, by telephoning and tele
graphing ahead for fresh horses.
[Â¦ Officers Escape . Injury.
They reached Mount Chestnut not more
than half, an hour after the Biddies and
Mrs. Soffel. At this point William Wat
son, storekeeper, had fresh horses .wait
ing for them and the chase for life began
anew.
The two sleighs carrying the eight offi
cers met the Biddies and Mrs. Soffel at
McClure's barn, two miles from Mount
Prospect. The Biddies, having learned
that they were almost overtaken and tak
ing what they considered the only chance
they N had drove eastward and met their
doom.
The Pittsburg and other officers were
armed with Winchester rifles and revolv
ers of large caliber. They shot to kill, and
their aim was perfect. The Biddies tried
to kill to the last of their string,' but not
one of the eight officers has a wound as
a result of the battle.
Woman Shoots at Pursuers.
When tho â¢ detectives got within about
sixty, yards of the fugitives they opened
fire. The Biddies promptly answered with
shotgun and revolvers. 'Mrs. Soffel. too,
stood up In tho sleigh with a revolver In
either hand and blazed away at her pur
suers. When Ed Biddle fell and when she
saw that* she -was about to be captured
she fired a bullet into her breast. "An ex
amination of her wound shows that she
will recover, aa tho bullet' was deflected
by her corset anu the wound Is compara

and will probably- end hl3 life before

a vital spot. The escape of the offlcers 13
miraculous. The Biddies have demon
strated on several occasions that they are
good marksmen -and why they should
have failed to-day to bring down their
men la a mystery. .
After the Biddies fell to the snow-cov
ered ground the officers picked up the ap
parently lifeless bodies of Mrs. Soffel and
the Biddies and took^ them ' back ' to But
lcrV where they ajso took the stolen sleigh,
and patched up the harness and worn-out

again. UcGovern ran up w.ithln five feet of
the boys and emptied his Winchester into them.
The Biddies then yielded and Roach and Mc-
Govern handcuffed them hands and feet and
they were taken to Butler. Mrs. Soffel, who

Ed Biddle's Dying- Statement.
At the jail to-night Ed Biddle called
for a priest and made the following state
ment: '.
I have been accused cf a great many serious
crimes. I admit that I have committed many
B.s the opportunities for them presented them-
Fclves. I want to say now that I did not kill
Detective Fitzgerald nor did I shoot Thomas
Kahney, nor was my brother Implicated in the
latter affair. Mrs. Soffel aided us In getting
out of the County Jail, and had it not been
for her we would have made our escape to
day. She gave up everything for us and I
was bound to back her. I did not shoot her.
She Â«hot herself.
Although I have been pictured to you as a
desperate man I still have some heart and
gratitude for the woman who helped us to
escape. She merely -did it out of sympathy
lor us. I persuaded her to. do It. I told her
I was guiltless of the crime for which I was
sbcut to be executed and she was impressed
.' nd yielded ' to my ! suggestion. I planned it
ell.
Father Walsh administered the last
r'tes of the dying, and Biddle rolled over
rn his face and sighed. He was asked
If he -wanted any word taken . to his
brother and he shook his head.
Mrs. Soffel made a statement after hor
< apture, In which she said she became In
volved in the affair through her sympa
i hy for Ed Biddle. She said she now real
ized â¢ her mistake and wished she was
'"Â«ad. She said she did not ehoot herself
l ut was the first one shot by the detec
tives. The officers say the woman was
armed, but do not think she fired any
rhots.
Dr. J. E. Ayers, who examined the Bid
dies and Mrs. Soffel as soon as the pris
oners were taken into the County Jail
made the following statement to-night â¢
The Â¦wounds of ell three prisoners are exceed
ingly grave and may result fatally before an
fther twenty-four hours. The bullet which
struck Mrs. Soffel. and which appears to be
Â«**lf-lnflicted. entered her left breast, going
through the nipple and passing back about six
inches, through her chest It lodged under the
fkin of the back, almost opposite its point of
entrance. From my examination of Mrs.
,. Soffel* wound I think ehe may live, but her
â¢ xposure to the cold and the excitement and
rÂ«*rvouÂ« chock of this affair may eo complicate
matters that her wound may prove fatal.

REDDING, Jan. 31.â Because he was
moved by a woman's bantering challenge
to quaff liquor at a banquet, after years
of abstinence. Dr. L. L. Sherrod of Carr
ville now occupies the insane cell in the
County Jail and will soon be removed to
a sanitarium. â¢ . â¢
Dr. Sherrod has fallen from the high
est rank in his profession until now he
is on the road to the madhouse.
The Carrville physician ' was brought
down on Sunday. At times he talks
rationally, then he grows excited, makes
crazy assertions about his wife and others
watching him through chinks of the cell
wall and reaches for. the pistol that had
been taken from him.
Dr. Sherrod's story is pathetic. He is
a man of 25 years, a graduate of a New
York Medical College and has a charming
wife." After, he left Â¦' college he went to
Texas. He succeeded well until he began
drinking, then he went down grade fast.
A liquor cure proved his salvation and he
got upon his feet again. His practice
grew until it yielded $1000 or $2000 a month.
One night at a banquet a lady, noticing
that Dr. Sherrod kept his glass turned
down, bantered him to quaff her health
in wine. The eyes of the guests were
upon Sherrod and he filled the glass and
drank. In three weeks 1* was back, in
the cutter. This occurred six years ago,
and ever since then Sherrod has been
struggling to regain the mastery of him
self.. He left Texas and -went to, San
Francisco. Temptations were too many
there and two years ago Dr. Sherrod and
his wife moved to Carrville. For three
months he has been drinking heavily and
using his pistol promiscuously.
Friends ' will - try to ' arrange ; to take
Sherrod to a private sanitarium'" until â¢ it
is , learned . whether being deprived of
liquor will not restore* his- mind.

All officers and employes of the United

by forbidden, either directly or Indirectly, in

THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
White House. January 31,,
Lobbying of office-holders not only for
higher salaries but for other legislation
in which they are personally interested
has become such a nuisance in Congress
that it was thought the only, thing that
could stop It was an executive order. The
matter was first called to the attention
of the President by officials of the Post
office Department, and later other Cabi
net members impressed on him the neces
sity of taking some action. The practice
among office-holders of lobbying in Con
gress has grown to such an extent that
regular unions have been formed for the
purpose of Influencing legislation.
. Chairman Cannon of the House Com
mittee on Appropriations said to-night
that the order was a great necessity and
he was glad that it had been issued. It
had been the custom, he said, for office
holders to attempt to influence legislation
in their .behalf, both through committees
and Individual members In Congress. ! They
Â¦would do this personally, by letter or
through" friends. Cannon thought that
this practice should be stopped and that
the President's order would have the^ de
sired effect. - â . . i

Charles S. Mellen, its president, and all
the directors. His attorneys are the same
as those in the Peter Power Injunction

It is aleged in the bill of complaint that
all the proceedings taken In furthering

the roads are already combined, and the
court is asked to adjudge all measures
taken thereto fraudulent and invalid and
to enjoin the registry of stock of the
Northern Pacific transferred to the
Northern Securities Company.
The court is also asked to forbid the

CHICAGO, Jan. 31.â Judge Tuley to-day
ordered a receivership for the Zion lace
industries, and Monday will enter a de
cree appointing Elmer Waahburn to a po
sition of receiver under a bond of $700,000.
The court, in a lengthy discussion of
the case, which was Instituted by Samuel
Stevenson,, a brother-in-law of John Al
exander Dowie, declared 'that Dowle*3
church, the Christian CrfthoUc church,
was a curious mixture of religion and
business. He held that Stevenson had,
through undue influence exerted by
Dowie, head of the church, been led to
turn over to Dowie practically every
thing he had and held that Stevenson was
entitled to at least ?100,000 from Dowie, or
the lace industries, which he said were
practically the same thing.
The court directed that Attorney Reeves
file an amended bill in order that the
stockholders of the lace Industries may
be made parties to the suit. The deci
sion being against the corporation, it is
necessary that the stockholders be pres
ent in court before a decree can be en
tered. The position of the stockholders,
the court said, was not plain. The evi
dence showed that they had paid over
$400,000 for stock, but that the transaction
was of such a character that Dowie alone
seemed to hold everything of value.
, "Undue influence" was the chief topic
discussed by the Judge in his decision,
Dowie, he said, was unquestionably the
superior of Stevenson, both in intellect
and business ability. Dowie, he declared,
was a religion zealot; Stevenson a fol
lower. Stevenson, like others In Zlon,
followed Dowie blindly. They believed
him the agent of the Almighty on earth,
destined to build up cities of Zlon in every
country in the world. None was more In
fluenced by. the teachings of "the reincar
.nated Elijah" than Stevenson.
It was the province of the court, he
said, to protect the weak against the
strong. It was not clear just to what ex
tent Stevenson had suffered monetary
loss, owing to the peculiar agreement be
tween stockholders in the lace industries
and Dpwie. It was clear, however, mat
Stevenson was entitled to $100,000. and
also clear that the $50,000 which Steven
son had. turned over to hia wife (now
dead*; and the latter had turned over to
Dowie. could not be collected.
"The - case needs- more light," said the
court. "I have studied over it night and
day for a month, yet on many points I
am in the dark. There should be a fur
ther .hearing.'.' . . ?
An amended bill' and an. amended an
swer will be filed by the parties to the.
suit Monday when the decree appointing
a receiver will be entered. Until then,
by stipulation. Dowie is prevented from
disposing of any more preferred stock.
Dowie will pray an appeal, and Judge
Tuley intimated that It would be grante-1.
owing to the peculiar points of law in-,
volved and the presence in the case cf
factors on which no law seemed to bear.
In discussing the bond for the receiver,
Attorney Packer, acting for Dowie. de
clared that if the receiver was for all cf
Dowle's property he should require a
bond of $10,000,000. The court explained
that only the lace industries were at pre^.
ent involved and 1700,000 was agreed on.

. SANTA CRUZ, Jan. 31.â Calif ornia lions
are committing depredations in the moun

They carried off four goats . from one
place. One of the goats weighed 125
pounds, "and was carried by a lion down
a canyon and then up a steep precijpicflu
jumped up and, raising a shotgun, fired at
ilcCrovern. He aimed badly and the shot scat
tered alongside the road. Almost eimulta
reously Detective McGovern and Koach dis
charged their Winchesters at Ed Biddle. Both
shots took effect. Jack Biddle raised in the
vehicle and discharged his revolver at the
three officers. Detective Swinthart steadied
himself and fired his 45-caliber Colt revolver
at Jack. The ball took effect in Jack's arm.'
Then the detectives opened a rapid fire on the
escapes. The shots knocked them out of the
sleigh. Ed fell sprawling on the snow and
Jack fell on top of him, their firearms falling
from their hands. The Biddies' horse then
hecame frightened and ran away across a field.
Mr. Kip is now in Pasadena and far
from well. As stated in The Call yester

clergyman, and. led by the Bishop, the
delegates united their prayers for his re
covery. The minister in charge of the
Cathedral Mission is now the Rev. J. T.
Turner, one of the younger of the
clergy of the v Diocese of California. The
mission founded by Rev. Mr. Kip is there
fore being well cared for and the results
that are being achieve* give the greatest
encouragement to every one concerned
with the object. -. Â¦ Â¦
The founding, of the Cathedral Mission
was quickly and emphatically justified by
the results. The earlier quarters of the
mission soon gave way .o an adequate
and completely equipped building, to which
the people nocked. Men, women and chil
dren who had not darkened the doors of
a church edifice for many years came
again and again and finally adopted the
mission as their religious home. â¢ The sick
were visited and relieved, the starving fed
and the consolations of religion offered to
the dying. The clergymen Were called
upon for duties of marriage an<4 burial for
the entire neighborhood and ttfe good will
of thousands of people was manifested in
many Â¦ways. For two years past the Rev.
Mr. Kip has been unable through an in
sidious illness to .take part in active
work and the prospect of his recovery
is so distant that, rather than embarrass
the work of the mission, he decided to
withdraw altogether, leaving to the care
of a physically capable and competent
head its future fortunes.
It wag a field bound to give rich re
turns to active effort and the Rev. Mr.
Kip entered upon the work with the de
termined purpose to bring the influence of
religion into those squalid homes. 9

morning and died at a late hour to-night
without having regained consciousness.
The stranger was a handsome woman,
about 45 years of age, and apparently

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Governor. Taft referred to the .federal
party in the islands and said he had been
given ; a petition from this party to be
presented â¢. to the American Congress, but
had. not yet decided; how to present it. â¢
| The committee, adjourned to meet at 11
o'clock to-morrow. Governor Taft said,
as he left the committee-room . that he
desired to return, to Manila on May, 1.
He - had . no knowledge of the reported
fights in Mindanao. On jts tour the com*
mission had been attended only by a cor
poral's.guard on the steamer, but â¢ there
Â¦was a. garrison of United States troops at
every capital visited. â¢ " Â¦'Â¦â¢-'. r "â¢:Â¦Â¦-.''
"There is," he said, "no war or, even
Insurrection in the ' Moro provinces, . but
there -are. occasional: reports of the mur
der of American soldiers." "
Asked if the Moros were generally
peaceable the witness replied that they
were bo except in â¢ individual cases. Â¦
Most Moros Peaceable.
In reply to Senator Hale Governor Taft
said that no effort had been "made to
extend the civil government of the United
States to the Moro' provinces beyond mak
ing a few suggestions bearing upon the
revenue laws. "Nothing hag been done
In* that direction,"' he said. "'Everything
is going on just as it was and the islands
are under the control of the War Depart
ment so far as the United States Is con
cerned." " ' - ~
The Jolo Sultan had, he said, refused to
recognize Spain's claim to any property
on the islands except the customs-houses
and there is considerable question as to
the ownership in many instances. . This
complication existed not only between the
Sultan and the United States, but between
the Sultan and his subjects. .
Governor Taft said it had been found
impossible to put Filipinos over the Moros
They are subject to their datos, or chiefs,
and refuse to recognize 'the authority of
a Filipino. There were, he said, two 'Sul
tans, one in Mindanao and the other In
the Jolo group, but the .Sultans do not
always control their datos. The Sultan
of Mindanao is, he said, very, poor,- but
the sovereign of the : Jolos is a thrifty
man, who is constantly trying to Increase
his income and constantlv getting Into a
row about it. - â¢
'.Â« Objection to Reorganizes.
Governor Taft said the commission had
had an interesting experience in trying to
reorganize the province of Antique but
that the people resisted vigorously. He
mentioned that at San Jose, the capital
they displayed a model of liberty enlight
ening the world which was twenty feet
high and had been dragged seven miles
over a very rough road. On this monu
ment^ there were statues of Washington
and McKinley. . Â¦
He then gave in detailthe proceedings
of the meetings at tne various places vis
ited, saying- tnaf some seventeen capitals
of the provinces were visaed on the first
tour. .At .-each: place the delegates of the
people 'were met; the prescribed special
act was passed and a Governor appdint
ed,- who was authorized to organize mu
nicipalities. These provincial govern
ments consist, he explained, of a Gover
nor, Secretary, Superintendent, Treasurer
and a fiscal or Prosecuting Attorney. In
all cases where the selection could be
made without arousing jealousies natives
had been chosen. All these appointments
are temporary, and next month their suc
cessors will be ; elected. When the fac
tions were too strong Americans were
placed at the head of each, provincial gov
ernment. In all'cases the Treasurer and
Superintendent were Americans.

Judge Taft," Civil Governor of the archi
pelago, was the first witness called. There
was a full attendance of the members of
the committee, "anjl Senator Ixxige, chair
man of the committee, explained that tho
committee desired not only the fullest in
formation concerning the islands, but any
advice ; that Governor Taft might offer

Governor Taft pegan by saying that he

provinces during the past year. He sa^d
that in alL the jj ihpmo or Christian prov

The Moros are all friendly, except a' few,
who had never been otherwise than hos

The contents of the note are kept se
cret, but the first publication of the text
is intended to j be made in Parliament
Monday, February 3. It is believed, how
ever, that its original summary of the
Dutch communication was correct, with
this addition, that the Dutch suggested
that Wessels, Wolmarans and Fischer,
the Boer delegates now in Europe, be
permitted to go to South Africa in an
endeavor to persuade the burghers in the
field to surrender. â¢
Great Britain's reply Is not in the na
ture of a direct negative, though It is not
unlikely that it will have that effect.
While Lord- Lansdowne probably leaves
a loophole for further suggestions, he
doubts the ability of the Boer delegates
to control their fellow-countrymen, and
-there seems, little likelihood that the
Dutch Government can" secure guaran
tees in .regard to the powers of the Boer
delegates sufficient to -induce Great Brit
ain to accede to the original request.

A supreme effort is being made by the
club to save Telegraph Hill from destruc

successful. An effort is being made to
prevail upon the Board of Supervisors to
take cognizance of the fact that the land
mark is gradually being effaced by the
hands of quarrymen. The organization is
striving to have the food given to the pa
tients at the City and County Hospital
better cooked and more properly served;
also to have a children's ward, in order
to keep the little ones out of the wards
occupied by their elders. A score of other
Important reforms are under considera

ing them, to a successful issue.
If her resignation is accepted it Is
feared other members 0/ the organiza
tion will follow her example. It Is tbere
foro probable that the meeting of the di
rectors on Monday next will be well at
tended. In* the meantime strenuous ef
forts .will be made to have Mrs. White
reconsider her action.
It is -due to her efforts that a plan 13
on foot to secure a suitable clubhouse for
the members. More than 53000 has been
subscribed, and If she should give up her
position it is feared the project will come
to naught. She has strenuously labored
to save the Calaveras big trees from de
struction, and without her leadership this
splendid work might also fail.
During the years Mrs. White has been
president the California Club has been In
strumental in bringing about many re
forms.
The resignation of the president will be
considered by the board of directors on
Monday next. There is every likelihood,
that It -will not be accepted. The mem
bers feel that if Mrs. White relinquished
the presidency she might quit the club.
If she was to take the latter course they
fear the organization would suffer disso
lution because of the lack of a leader.
I According to a member of the club.
Mrs. "White has been the mainstay of the
organization. She has proven herself pos
sessed of executive ability and her influ
ence in the community has been felt time
and again. As president of the Califor
nia Club Mrs. White has been ln the head
and front of every movement tending to
benefit the people at large.
Her main- reason for taking the action
she said was due to the fact that certain
members of the California Club had whol
ly ignored resolutions passed by the di
rectors of the organization. In effect
these resolutions suggested that It was
inexpedient for the California Club to
commit Itself either in favor of or against
the admission of clubs of colored women
to the National Federation of Women's
Clubs. The members had voted to in
struct the club's delegation to the Cali
fornia Federation convention to vote for
the admission of colored women. . Mra..
White could not accept these instructions
and rather than be in opposition to other
members resigned her office.
The resignation of Mrs. Lovell White
as president of the California. Club has
created consternation ln the ranks of the
members. Every effort Is being: made to
have her reconsider her action, but she
remains adamant. Yesterday dozens of
ladies called upon. Mrs. White and tried
to prevail upon her to continue as presi
dent of the club, but she pointed out good
and substantial reasons why she could
not act ln that capacity.

POLITE REFUSAL
The reduction bill is rather lengthy, as
several schedules have to be readjusted.
All rates, however, are brought back to
these existing before the Spanish war,
except on mixed flour. The repeal sec
tion Is brief and restores the old rates.
In some cases, as in that of cigars, to
bacco, beer, etc., the changes have been
made since the original war taxes were
imposed, so that a simple repeal of exist
ing law would not restore ths old rates.
Special sections cover these cases.

Among the men who were thus arrested
was a man who gave the name of Henry
Kramp.' In a- notebook found in his
pocket were entries showing that he had
served time In an Oregon jail. The name
of Charles Beck was also found In the
book. Sheriff Taylor held Kramp, or
Beck, from Friday evening. until Sunday
morning waiting to hear from Captain
Seymour. Chief of the San Francisco de
tective force, whom he had notified of the
arrest and of his suspicions, but as the
latter did not pay any attention to the
matter, the man was released and allowed
to leave town. From Â¦ the picture of
Goucher, which was published in the'pa
pers a day or bo ago, Sheriff- Taylor is
convinced that he had the right man.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 31.â The officers

nection with the murder of Policeman
Robinson, was lodged here in the Marin

erable curiosity. Men, women and chil
dren passed to and fro In front of "Lead
ville Jimmy" and Detective Dinan, > to
whom the task of bringing: the murderer
safely back to the city was " intrusted,
simply to get a glimpse of the man whom
Chief of Police Wittman" believes was one
of the gang that shot down Policeman
Robinson. It was a curious throng that
jostled and crowded one another at the
depot 'to get near enough to see" the pris
oner.
Detective Dinan and the prisoner were
met at the ferry depot by Policeman J.
D. Freel, who was detailed by Chief Witt
man to be on hand to assist Dinan to get
the prisoner to the Hall of Justice. '
Inclined to Bo Ugly.
On leaving Stockton the prisoner was a
bit inclined to be erratic and ugly, but on
the way down in the train he grew good
natured. "Leadville Jimmy" has a rather
bad habit of feigning- insanity when
placed under arres^ but as this trait was
well known to the officers he was soon
made to realize that a scene would not be
tolerated.
On arriving at the Hall of Justice the
prisoner was taken into the office of Chief
of Detectives John Seymour, who vainly
attempted to get him to "peach" on his
"pals." ... .
Seymour's clumsy style of questioning
prisoners was not a novelty to "Lead
ville Jimmy," for during his checkered
career he has pitted his wits against
nearly every rural Constable from one
end of the continent to the other.
"Leadville" refused to be "pumped" by
Captain Seymour, .who finally grew tired
of his inability to keep pace with the
sharpened wits of the thug and ordered
Detective Dinan to take him upstairs to
the prison and keep him. absolutely in
communicado. The chief of. detectives
evidently issued this order to obviate the
possibility of some of the street otlicers
succeeding in geting "Leadville", to talk.
Captain Seymour and the . two sleuths
Â¦who have been 'working on the Robinson
case have about exhausted their limited
iepertoire of methods of capturing crim
inals. They have settled down to a wait
ing game, hoping that throughout the
country there are a few more, clever Con
stables like Geiseke of Tracy who caught
"Leadville Jimmy" and delivered . him
over into their hands. Chief Wittman Is
keeping the wires hot with telegrams to
the interior towns notifying the Con
stables and Sheriffs to be on the lookout
for the rest of the gang of murderers
whom he, in all probability, believes have
succeeded in evading Captain Seymour
and his subordinates.
Seymour Learns Facts.
When The Call published Its exclusive
story of the gang's operations on the
night that Robinson was murdered Cap
tain Seymour first learned that there
were six men Implicated in the murder,
and that "Leadville Jimmy," the thug
now In custody, was one of them. He
also refused to believe that the men had
been out . to Cypress Lawn - Cemetery,
where they attempted to blow open ' the
safe In the superintendent's house or that
in the . battle with revolvers which oc
curred when the desperate gang met Rob
inson on Valencia street "Brownie" was
wounded. Chief Wittman, however, who
had been conducting a quiet Investigation
on his own accord, had the information in
his hands for several days and it. was his
efforts"- that resulted in the capture of
"Leadville Jimmy." Â¦
The police took a woman Into custody

This testimony. is In direct contradiction to

that he went to Trowbridge's store and sat

said that when Trowbridge closed the store
he went up the street with him.
The â¢ witness was questioned regarding his

testimony contradicted that given by Myers,

ALTURAS, Jan. 31.â Sidney A. Goyette, the
youthful witness for the defense, who was
placed on the stand yesterday to testify in
the case of the People vs. Brown, was again
on the stand to-day. He said that he was
around Myers' Hotel much of the time dur
ing the week preceding the lynching of Cal
vin Hall, his two sons, "Jim" and Frank;
Daniel Yantis and young Mnrtln Wilson, and
never at any time saw demonstrations of vio
lence against them or, heard any one say that
they deserved hanging. Goyette reiterated the
statement made yesterday to the effect that
Brown did not go outside the hotel to light a
cigar on the night of the lynching. This
statement is in contradiction of the testimony
given by : Brown before the Grand Jury.
The cross examination, so far as it went
this morning, disclosed several discrepancies
In the testimony given on the stand by Ervlng
Carpenter and Samuel Parks, and of the-wit
ness' own declarations before the Grand Jury,
when that body was investigating the Lookout
lynching. Goyette said this morning that he
eat on the porch of Trowbridge's store on the
evening of May 30 until almost 0 o'clock with
"Jim" Brown, the defendant, and that they
went Â¦ to Â¦ Brown's house and retired. In hia
testimony before the Grand Jury, Goyette said

. Hawley ( advocated ' the amendment of
Stewart to increase the salaries of Sena
tors and Representatives in Congress.
Spooner of "Wisconsin supported the bill
and said there were cases where men had
refused appointments on the Supreme
bench' because the salaries were inade
quate. Â¦ Â¦
Stewart gave notice, of an amendment
to the bill, . providing that the salaries of
Senators and Representatives, in Con
gress should be $7500 per annum. Mc-
Comas of Maryland, Hawley of Connecti
cut and Fairbanks of Indiana supported
the measure.
Berry (D.) of Arkansas opposed the
measure. He believed that $10,000 per year
Â¦was enough to enable Justices of the Su
preme Court to live respectably. He ven
tured the statement that many. people
thought the Justices were not worth' $10,
000 a year.
Stewart (R.) of Nevada made a strong
plea for the enactment of the bill.
Blackburn of Kentucky, a member of
the Judiciary Committee, vigorously op
posed the measure, not so much because
ne thought the salaries proposed were too
high, as because he felt that there ought
to be a general revision of- salaries paid
io officials of the Government.
Hoar made a brief statement in support
of the measure. He believed members' of
the Judiciary. of the United States were
entitled to such salaries as would enable
them to maintain suitable and proper po
sitions. The judicial salaries paid by the
Government were not" equal to those paid
by many of the greaUS tates of the Union

phatically and the court remarked:
I wish you gentlemen would get your guns

me and I can't sit' and take it all the time â
that Is all there is to It.
Raker left the courtroom.
Raker â I have got tired ' of his conduct in
this matter. I do not propose to allow him to
sit here and gag things down my throat when
I know it is not true; he can't do it.
The Court â Now open your mouth again in
that insulting way and I will put you out of
this case. Â¦ â¢.
Rakerâ My statement amounts to just as
much as that man's does; it is just as good as
that of any lawyer or gentleman. I have heard
enough of this bulldozing talk. Because he is
Assistant Attorney General he can't bulldoze
me and this Jury.
The Court â No, Raker, it does not make any
difference; your statement does not amount to
a row of pins. - - . .
ALTURAS, Jan. 21.â One of the most
disgraceful scenes that have character
ized the Lookout lynching" case in Judge
Harrington's - court occurred -this after
noon and resulted -.in, Attorney John E.
Raker, for the defense, being sent from
the courtroom for twenty^five minutes for
resenting remarks addressed to him by
the court. Probably never before has a
California courtroom crowd witnessed the
spectacle -of the Judge on the bench ad
vising the opposing counsel to adjourn to
the street and fight out their legal differ
ences with pistols. .
The disturbance was precipitated when
Raker attempted to â¢ read from. Sidney
Goyette's testimony, given at the Coro
ner's inquest over the ; body of Daniel
Yantis. Assistant Attorney General Post,
for the prosecution, objected and was
sustained. Raker protested and thÂ« court
remarked : . ,'
If there la any -wray to violate the rule of the
court, you can always find a way of dointr It.
Rakerâ Judge, if it is the only way to get the
truth, give us that opportunity. Let the truth
go to these twelve men sitting in this jury. box.
The Court â I say so, too.
Raker â Then let us learn it.
The Qourt â I don't approve of your methods
of getting: the truth.
Raker â You know this is competent evi
dence?
Post â I know it is not,
Rakerâ I know you say not, but you do not
think so.

The officers of the United States gun

trophies of an exciting' hunting expedi
tion in which some of them took T>art
while the vessel was stationed at Panama
December 30, when five of the officers left
the ship on a cayman hunt. The cay r
man is the Central and South American
crocodile, or alligator. The officers pro
ceeded fourteen miles to the Calmlto Hiv
er and then up the river about two miles,
when the tug grounded. They reached
the lair of the cayman in small boats.
Armed with tee .236 rifles, they shot
many, but .secured the bodies of only five,
lieutenant J. L. Sticht and Xaval Cadet
B. A. Long shot, and brought back three.
Lieutenant A. C. Dieffenbach, Passed As
sistant Surgeon Spear and Assistant Pay
master T. P. Sackett secured two. The
caymans secured measured from eight
and a half to twelve feet in length. It
takes a good shot to kill a- cayman, for
with all his size the eye is all the brute
exposes to the hunter. The bodies were
taken aboard the Concord and placed in
pickle for preservation until the day of
exhibition to San Francisco nimrods. The
brine fermented, however, and the good
of the service demanded a burial at sea
for the whole big bag.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
The flames soon spread to the five-story
Albemarle apartment house, opposite the
Virginia Club, which was quickly de
stroyed, and then to the entire " block
facing the Atlantic and running from
Plum to Main street. Within an hour
this block was in ruins. " . '
The flames started in the Columbia,
which was the largest but one of Nor
folk's office buildings. It was a structure
elx stories high and was built in 1892 by
Davis Lowenberg, its owner. The fire
was discovered at 1:55 thi6 morjjlng, and
shortly afterward 100 gallons of whisky
stored in the building exploded with ter
rific force, tearing out the front wall.
The firemen were driven back by the ex
plosion | and before they could- get' a
stream of water on the flames the entire
building was on fire. Hardly fifteen min
utes later the north wall, which was over
175 feet high, fell in, destroying the home
of the Virginia. Club k wfaicn adjoined the
building on the north. ,â¢
From the outset it was evident that the
Immense Atlantic Hotel was doomed.. J.
Hull Davidson, its proprietor, personally
made the rtfunds of the rooms and aided
by his assistants aroused every guest in
the builtling: . To this is due the fact that
eo far as known no life was lost, although
about S00 people were asleep in the hotel
when the alarm "was sounded. The little
army of half-dressed men and women
refugees from the flames elbowed their
way through the crowded streets. In
their hands they carried such small be
longings as they were able to save in
their night.
Tho conflagration, one of -the greatest
in the history of Norfolk, started shortly
before 2 o'clock this morning, and when
finally subdued over half a million dol
lars' worth of. property had been de
stroyed. The loss is believed to be- f un
covered by insurance. .
NORFOLK, Va.Â« Jan. SLâ A heap of
smoking ruins is all that remains of the
Atlantic Hotel, the massive Columbia of
fice building; which adjoined the hotel;
the Albemarle flats and- a block of stores
in the center of the city.

TURNED OUT TRUE. j
Coffee Drinking Ecsponsible. f
j Â¦"'/Â¦' . ' â¢ '
"At a dinner party a number of years
ago a physician made Chls 'statement:
"Coffee drinking is responsible: for more |
ills than any other one thing, 6ut It Js j
impossible for me to make my patients j
focllevB it.* Â¦ .-.'- j
' "KeithEr would I believe him, but con- I .
tinued to drink my coffee with sweet i
content After a time I became aware of |
the fact that I was frequently, lying '
awake nearly all night without any ap-
parent reason, and the morning found me
tired out and nervous.
"The insomnia increased, then came a
dull pain at the base of the brain and j
eevere pressure at my heart. Sly outside i
work was given up, for I could hardly j
bear the little fatigue of the day. 'Nerv- j
ous prostration brought .on by overwork,'
the doctor said. I thought of the words
of old Dr. Bagley. 'Coffee Is the poison
that* is responsible,' etc., etc.
"I had heard of Postum Food Coffee (
and determined to try It. The first cup !
was so weak and flat that It was not fit j
4o drink. The next time It was prepared
I looked after it myself to see that the '
â¢Jirecticns were followed properly. -The
..lesult was a revelation; I found it a de- i
licious beverage.
"The cure was not wrought In a day, ;
tut little by little ray nerves became
Vlrong. the pain ecvrid. and again I could
tclcep Uke r. tired child.
"I am now complete y roFtoml Â£> health
ly Postum Food Ccffc-o used in place of.
ordinary coffee, have rr'sair.ed the frosh
complexion of cirlli^cd, a.id 1 can realise
the truth of tho old doctor's RtatttncSiM
1 wish people could uncierytar.d that ttutS
oerore they permit coCee to break them
down.
"I have known of rcvcral others who
have been restored to health by leaving i
off coffee arid taking up Postum Food j
Co^'ee. Please do not publish my name,
but I am willing to answer letters of in-
â¢ quiry If stamp is inclosed." Name given

STARTS
WITH A COLD,
Catarrh is a | /^^^^Â£3
lingering cold l//i$~|Â§|Â£^\
which refuses |j|(| "^^^^
to yield to or- ' Â»(\|fc_^*i8
dinary treat- i'/jj^YV fff
Catarrh usually starts with a cold in the '
head and if left unchecked "in this "climate
rarely cets well of itself. â¢ 'â¢, 'Â¦-Â¦'Â¦
, Ab_ fresh cold la taken the disease spreads,
getting . deeper and deeper, creeping along thÂ»
mucous membranes from nose to throat, j from
throat to windpipe, from windpipe. to bronchial
tubes and. from bronchial tubes to lung cells. .
The mucous membranes' all connect, one with ;
another.' Hence it is easy, to spread : from onÂ» !
part to another lined with this same: membrane.
This Is why catarrh In the head soon affects the
throat and finally the stomach Itself, bringing
on chronic catarrh of the stomach," which is a
most obstinate form of dyspepsia.
Â¦Kverybody is now well, agreed that catarrh Is
a blood disease and not a local one, and the at-
tempt to cure by local applications simply gives
temporary' relief, from the purely local symp-
toms without the remotest effect in staying the
progress of the disease.' . . . " , .
There Is a new preparation recently offered to
the public that Is apparently destined to do
away; with every other form of catarrh treat-
ment. * - ' ' " V ' Â¦:.Â¦;>
' - This new remedy is not a secret patent medi-
cine, but is a large, pleasant tasting tablet com-
posed of Bloodroot, Red gum from the Eucalyp-
tus tree, and other valuable and harmless spe-
cifics, which are taken -internally and. seem to
Â¦ have ' a' remarkably /beneficial effect - upon thÂ«
blood and mucous membranes, apparently elimi-
nating , -the fcatarrhal poison from the - whola
system. â¢ ' : ' -V -. - â¢ ;Â¦'-Â¦Â¦
. These tablets, .while being pleasant,' conven-
ient 'and absolutely safe to use, have made
cures in long standing cases of catarrh that
are little short of marvelous. They are sold by
druggist* under name of Stuart's Catarrh Tab-
lets, and any catarrh sufferer who has tried
Â¦inhalers, lotions, '. ointments. , salves, etc:, and
realized their â¢ Inconvenience . ' and uselessness
will fully appreciate the difference between a
mere palliative and a permanent cure after giv-
ing Stuart's Catarrh Tablets an impartial trial "
All druggists sell . them Â¦ at 60 cents for full
sized' package, and no matter where the catarrh
is located, in the. head,' throat, lungs or stom-
ach, Stuart's Catarrh Tablets will surprise you j
with the effective result of Â«ven"'a few days use. IAt the close of the recount in Judge Mu
rasky's court yesterday, Edward I. Walsh
was 132 votes ahead of George Alpers.
Walsh gained 11 votes in the two precincts
counted yesterday, the first of the Thirty
eighth " and seventh of the Forty-second
Assembly districts. Coglan gained 9 votes
on Eggers and Bent lost 12. â¢

At one time Mone possessed considerable
money, In former times being a director
in several railroads and other corpora
tions. ;â¢,?.;:>;;
Jovial and generous, "Johnny" Mone
will probably be best and longest remem
bered In his connection with early base
ball in California. He always remained
a loyal supporter of the national game,
and nothing pleased him more than to
gather about him a crowd of friends and
recount* the wondrous ability of the old
baseball favorites who used to play when
the Halght-street grounds was the, Mecca
of the people. Â¦ ' ' - â¢ â¢--.
About this time he commenced the study
of law and entered the law office of Mc-
Dougall, Sharp & Lloyd. Although the two
senior members of the firm subsequently
died, Mone remained a clerk in Lloyd's
office until about a year ago, when he
commenced the practice of law for him
self. Up till about two months ago he
had an office in the Clunle building. At
the time of the reorganization of the Su
perior Courts of this city, Mone was
awarded the position of Court Commis
sioner, which ofllce he held " until his
death.
John J. Mone was born In Boston, April
7, 184'J. He came to this city in May. 1864,
to spend his school vacation with his pa
rents, who had settled here several years
previous. What was intended as only a
month's visit was protracted' into a so
journ for life. Shortly after arriving here
he engaged himself with Charles and Ar
thur Nahl, now deceased, artists who por
trayed pioneer scenes in California. After
a year's application to brushes, pencils
and palettes Â¦ he gave up his study and
became identified with several debating
and theatrical societies which flourished
here In the old days and furnished amuse
ment at the old Turn Vereln Hall and
Platfs Hall.
John J, Mone, who will long be remem
bered as the president of the old Califor
nia Baseball League, and who for over a
quarter of a century was a prominent fig
ure in legal circles of this 'city, was found
dead yesterday afternoon In his'apart
ments at 320 McAllister street. Death was
due to asphyxiation. Shortly after noon
one of the roomers in the ' house where
Mone resided detected the odor of gas
issuing from Hone's apartments. The
door leading to the rooms was unlocked,
and when opened Mone was found dead
in bed. He was undressed, as if he had
retired for the night. Gas was flowing
into the room from, two open gas jets.
The friends of the old-time baseball pat
ron are loth ! to believe tnat he commit
ted suicide. They are of the opinion that
he went to bed and neglected to turn off
the gas and that during the night tha
light was extinguished by a sudden gust
of wind. -- : *
Mr. Trumbo became financially embarrassed

A similar decision was rendered some
time ago by Judge ,Hunt. but It was set
aside on motion ot Estee's attorneys, who
claimed that they had not been notified,
that the case was to coma up for trial.
, Estee claimed that he agreed to give
hi3 legal services to the value ot the note,
but this was denied by Trumbo. In the
deposition taken at Honolulu, which was
offered in evidence yesterday, Estee says
he. never received any consideration for

Orrin S. Henderson, chairman of the
San Joaquln County Board of Supervis
ors, has entered the race as a. Republican
candidate- for the Railroad Commission:
Henderson is in the Third District, that
is now represented by N. Blackstock of
"Ventura County. He is one of the most
progressive of the young men of the San
Joaquin Valley. He is active in fraternal
circles Rnd stands high in business af
fairs. The . Stockton : Independent j says
that Henderson is one of the most ener
getic and capable men . in public life in
Central California. â¢
Mayor Â¦ Clark of -Sacramento is the
latest addition to the list, of candidates
for Railroad Commissioner in the First
District. *
It Is common â¢ gossip that Perkins and
Metcalf have agreed to recommend Tom
Dargie for Postmaster of Oakland, but the
fact comes to light that Postmaster
Friend is making strenuous effort to re
tain the place. Many merchants, bank
ers and others of the guild known as
leading men indorse Friend and commend
his management of postal affairs. The
point is raised that Senator Perkins, the
new apostle of civil service, cannot con
sistently invoke the spirit of reform in
the civil service to save Lynch and then
refuse its Invocation to protect Postmas
ter Friend. Again, the question is asked,
"Why should Frank Leach of the Mint be
retained and Friend cast out?" ,
Senator Perkins ha3 sent word to his
followers that they must keep their hands
off the gubernatorial fight. This signifies
that the out and out advocates of Per
kins for another term must not shout for
Preston, Flint, Pardee or Gage. An Oak
land State Senator who assumed to speak
for the State administration on the floor
of the Senate at one time early in the last
session of the Legislature finds himself
in a very uncomfortable position. He is
fond of Gage, but he fears Pardee.

Jesse *B. Fuller. " When' Senator Perkins
and Representative Metcalf decided that
Colonel Fuller could not be removed, a
dead set 'was made by Cal Ewing to se
cure Babcock's appointment as post
master of Alameda. The fact was then
revealed that Postmaster Lydecker was
solid with, the powers, and a break was
suddenly made in' another direction to un
cover something for Babcock. All sorts
of suggestions were made for taking care
of him. When Jerome died, leaving the
chief clerkship vacant. Babcock was at
once listed as a candidate to fill the va
vancy. At first blush one is inclined to
fancy that Colonel Babcock Is the most
persistent and insistent office seeker in
the wide West, but the truth is he hold3
the modest little office of Court Commis
sioner and is not making special effort to
get anything else. It happehs, however,
that the politicians across the bay have
it in mind that Clarence Crowell, ch&Ir
man of the Alameda- County Republican
Committee, must be appointed Court
Commissioner, and in order to carry out
the design are' seeking for a place in
which to put 'Babcock. Indications are
that Babcock will get something In the
Custom-house, and that' Crowell will get
the office of Court- Commissioner. The
settlement of this agitation will afford re
lief to Senator Perkins and Representa
tive Metcalf.
Mrs. Kilbourn, . who is a well known
resident of Santa Rosa, went to visit the

missed them. In disposing -of the. case
Judge Mogan characterized Mrs. Kil

liquor and not to be believed. He em
phatically asserted that the accused men
left his court without a stain on their
characters. . . â¢ Â¦ ,.
The action of Judge M,ogan was brought

for attempted assault was returned
against Flynn. Judge Cook ordered, the

STATEMENT OE EARNINGS
There is a berth somewhere In reserve
for a good man from Alamedaâ the ofllce
holders' paradise. The position may be
called- discharging inspector, assistant
storekeeper or guardian of the. Golden
Gate, but whatever it is, or by what name
It may go -by. Colonel Babcock is slated
for it. Babcock la not seeking the office,
but the office seems to be seeking him. A
few; weeks ago Colonel Babcock's cham
pions were in Washington predicting that
the ; country â¢ would go to perdition
with Alameda County In advance, if Colo
nel Babcock-were not immediately ap
pointed pension agent to succeed Colonel
Place for Colonel Babcock.
Other changes in the nature of promo
tion follow the advancement of Unger.
Ellis H. Holmes Is assigned, at his own
request, to the place formerly held by
Unger. Holmes was recently offered the/
place of acting deputy collector, rwith a
salary of $1600 per annum, but he signified
a- preference if or the position of seizure
clerk at the same salary. Thomas J.
Barry, one of the most popular men in
town, has been appointed acting deputy
collector, and D. J. O'Leary, president of
the Young Men's Institute, has been as j
signed to the clerical position formerly
held by Barry.: O'Leary has been serving
as inspector at the Mail dock. The sal
ary .of. the Â¦ clerkship in the .office is not
quite as good as that which he has been
receiving- as inspector, but the comforts
of the new place will offset the reduction.
J. .H. Witty, assistant weigher, has been
promoted from a position paying ?1100 per
annum to a place .worth $1200. Thomas J.
Coffey was appointed elevator conductor,
the compensation being $600 per annum.
FRED S. STRATTON, Collector of
the Port, of San Francisco, yes
terday appointed Cress Unger
chief clerk in the Custom-house.
: to fill the vacancy caused by the
death of K. B. Jerome. In making this
appointment the Collector respected civil
service requirements. Unger has been
twenty-six years In the Custom-house,
and much of his time during late years
was passed in the office of the chief clerk,
where he acquired knowledge of the im
portant duties that he is now expected to
perform. He is courteous and obliging
in demeanor. Unger' s promotion from
seizure clerk, a position that commands a
salary of $1000 per annum, to the chief
clerkship, with a salary of $4000 a year,
ia quite, an advance. There is no sure
thing, however, that the compensation
will not be diminished. In recognition ot
Jerome's special qualifications the salary
attaching to the- chief clerkship was
raised from $3600 to $4000 per annum.
IROQXJOIS CXTTB OPPOSES Â¦
OPENING OF INGU3STDE
"I found opposition to Gage in San
Diego and Riverside counties." remarked
Senator Belshaw to-day, "and Flint is
gaining friends every day, even In this.
Gage's home county." ;
Senator Perkins and his friends seem to
have known of Belshaw's intention to visit
Southern California, for George Hatton
will be In Los Angeles to-morrow and will
visit every county south of Tehachapl in
the interest of his chief.
Senator Perkins insisted . to President
Roosevelt that as chairman of the Com
mittee on Civil Service In the United
States Senate he would oppose the re
moval of Collector Lynch. That objection
is believed to have saved to Lynch his
position.
Belshaw is for Thomas Flint Jr. for
Governor and dees riot take seriously the
candidacy of Dr. George C. Pardeo- of
Oakland. Belshaw is convinced I>r. Par
Â¦dee is put forth as a stalking horse, to be
traded in the State convention by mem*
bers of the delegation from his home
county.
. Belshaw is mad and he does not hes
itate to show his feelings. He will not
admit that he intends to oppose Senator
Perkins' re-election at Sacramento next
year, further than to say he would un
doubtedly vote for Perkins in preference
to Burns. Pressed to name a favorite
among the numerous candidates talked of
his svmpathies seemed to lie with Victor
Metcalf. ' â¢ Â¦'- :â¢ ; â¢
The speaker was State Senator M. Bel
shaw of Antioch, who reached Los Ange
les to-day. Belshaw J TeinfÂ©reed his charge
with the statement that last August, j in
San Francisco, Senator Perkins informed
a committee, consisting of Senator Bel
shaw. Senator Caldwell of Riverside and
Senator C. S. Smith of Kern, :that he
would assist in removing John C. Lynch
provided Senator Bard would join in the
project. Belshaw says that when he and
Senator Bard interviewed President
Roosevelt in Washington a few weeks
ago the President surprised them by in
sisting that Senator Perkins had pro
tested to him against Lynch's removal.
"I was surprised, to put it mildly," re
marked Belshaw,' "and spoke to Perkins
as soon as I saw him. In' reply he backed
and filled and while I did not call the
Senator a liar, wellâ" and the look on
Senator Belshaw's face spoke louder than
the sentence he had cut short.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 31.â "Steohen F.
Kelly was induced to become an applicant
for Collector of Internal Revenue in this
district at the direct instance of Senator
Perkins. Congressman Needham is my
authority for this statement and I have
Needham's permission to make this decla
ration."

BELSHAW SCORES PERKINS.
from the Northern counties that the
horticulturists and .farmers, whatever
happens, will have none of Gage. He is
not liked In Sacramento by the mass of
the voters^ but it is realized that If the
machine wants him it will have him,
whether trfe people desire him or not.
This is a contingency, however, which '.
Gage does not want, and he Is flirting
with both sides. In the hope of being irr
the good graces of both in the event of
a reconciliation, or of either side that may
win in a contest at the primaries. Clark
is= credited with a desire to become the
'"boss" of city and. county politics, and
t-j become, likewise, the spokesman for
the railroad. It is even said that he has
en eye well into the future for the Gov
ernorship, and that at the next election he
will be willing to take the Railroad Com
missioncrship as a stepping stone.
As a foil to this situation comes word
Governor Playing Both, Ends.
Though out of his position as railroad
division superintendent, Wright still con
trols the County Central Committee.
Clark, on the othtr hand, has the entire
municipal administration at his back,
v/ith considei*able local prestige outside
the office holders. Both factions couhl
put up a handsome fight, '-/i'.--
On the contrary, there will be one of
the bitterest contests for supremacy at
trie next primary election this city has
ever beheld.
However, there are weightier things than
the Coronership hanging in the balance.
The political wirepullers of the Governor
are doing their best to reconcile the Wright
and Clark factions 60 as to insure a
united delegation for Gage from Sacra
rnento County to the Republican State
Convention. So long as it remains un
determined whether Kruttschnitt or Her
rln is to speak for the railroad, the local
situation will not be entirely definite.
Kruttschnitt dislikes Wright and favors
Clark; Herrin, on the other hand, is a
stanch supporter of Wright. If Krutt
sciinitt is to dominate the political policy
of the railroad. Clark will be perfectly
satisned with his position; but if Herrin
is to dominate and chooses Wright to rep
resent him here, as it is believed he cer
tainly would, there will be no joining of
the Clark and Wright force*.
Gage's Managers Diligent-
Clark wants his business partner, A. P.
Booth, for County Coroner, and he de
mands one of the Superior Judgeships for
Albert SI. Johnson. There is not a man
in the county .of higher personal reputa
tion than Booth, but the incumbent,
George C. McMullen, is an old-time Re
publican, an ex-Sheriff and ex-Super
visor and a shrewd politician, and he has
announced that he desires the office of
Coroner again and does not propose to
be shut out of the renomlnation. Right
here there is likely to be a clash, with
Clark representing Booth and Wright
standing sponsor for McMullen.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. SLâ Although
many of the political prophets believe
there will be a reconciliation between the
forces of Colonel J. B. Wright and Mayor
George H. Clark, those who are "on the
Inside" of the local situation know that
r.o reconciliation has yet taken place. A
meeting between the two chiefs has been
arranged, with their consent, by mutual
friends for the latter part of next week.
The demands of each faction will then
De made known and it â¢will be determined
whether they shall unite in harmony or
fight each other for supremacy at the
next general primary.

It is not to be expected that all men will agree
with this, sanguine view of the situation. ; Even,
however, if we concede that it is colored too much by
optimism, the fact remains that it is much nearer
The capable leader to whom Mr. Harris refers is
of course Booker T. Washington. :To him Mr. Har
ris pays the tribute of honor, he has so well deserved,
and he points out that Washington obtained recog
nition and leadership among his race in the face of
an opposition far more powerful than' is generally
known. He says: "The preachers made stump
speeches against Washington from their pulpits and
thousands of pamphlets and articles were printed and
circulated from one end of the South to the other."
Washington, however, has now established his lead
ership, and under his wise guidance the negroes are
progressing rapidly toward a full attainment of pros
perity. ; - -?>"'â¢'*Â¦ ';Â¦ ' - :
Of the negro himself Mr. Harris says: "A vast
improvement has taken place in the conditions and
the prospects of the negro race. It must be remem
bered that they began to enjoy the benefits of free
dom when their prosperity was at zero or some <ie
grees lower. Consequently it must be insisted that
the material improvement which has taken place
amounts almost to a transformation. This statement
could be refuted by individual instances and many
unhappy combinations of circumstances could be
marshaled against it, and yet it is more than substan
tially true. The transformation has been, both men
tal and material. The attitude of the race toward
the only capable leader it ever had is proof of the
one, and the tax books of the Southern States are
proof of the other." :.."'.
According to the writer there was a race problem
in the South immediately after emancipation, but it
has been solved by time. He contends that the two
races are getting along together better in the South
than in the North, "where colored men find it very
difficult to earn their living in the various trades and
occupations that are open to white men." Race pre
judice, he adds, "is an affair that has nothing to do
with color; it seems to be an instinct of the human
mind. It is but one of the equipments of our poor
human nature, and it rests with Christianity to eradi
cate and obliterate it."
JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS, whose "Uncle
Remus" books as well as his many other writ
ings attest his close and sympathetic study of
the negro in the South, has contributed to the Phila
delphia Record a notable article dealing in a serious
way with the condition of the negro and with his re
lations to the white race. The author is something
more than an optimist \vhp believes the "problem
will be solved in t^ie right way in due time." He
claims that it has been already solved and that there
is now no problem involved in the situation. The
negro is doing well at the present time, says Mr.
Harris, and he will do better in each succeeding year
I for an indefinite period.
A DISSOLVING PROBLEM.
It will be seen that but a small proportion of the
economists, applied to answered the circular, and that
while among those who did reply there was a strong
majority in favor of each of the propositions there
was by no means a universal agreement. In some
respects the disagreement is not surprising, for
economy is far from being an exact science; but still
there might 1 have been an . agreement upon ! such
propositions as those relating to public franchises and
ground rent, which, after all, were hardly more than
definitions. Taken as a whole the questions and
answers show that political economists can hardly.be
safe guides in devising economic legislation, ; and it
will be wisefor the people to continue as before in
relying upon common sense and experience instead
of upon theories .and professors. , .
3â "Public franchises" are exclusive free privileges
granted to one or several persons incorporated, and
from which the mass of citizens are excluded. These
franchises usually pertain to land, including, as they do
(to use the language of the New York legislative (Ford)
bill), all "rights, authority or permission to construct,
maintain or operate,' iÂ»:, under, above, upon or through,
any streets, highways, or public places, any mains,
pipes, tanks, conduits, or wires, with " their appur
tenances for conducting water, steam, heat, light,
power, gas, oil or other substance,, or electricity for tele
graphic, telephonic or other purposes." Hence their
classification, by tha above act, as "land values" may
be confirmed as correct, and their annual values prop
erly classed as ground rent. Yes,, 103; no, 25.
4â A tax upon ground rent. is a direct tax, and cannot
be shifted. Yes, 108; no, 26.
jj 5â The selling value of land is, under present condi
tions in most of tho American States, reduced by the
capitalized tax that is laid upon it. . Yes, 105; no, 17.
6â Hence the selling value- of land is, to the same ex
tent, an untaxed value, so far as any purchaser, subse
quent to the imposition of the tax, is concerned. Yes,
85; no, 24. "Â¦ . â¢
: 7â The normal price of a labor product is fixed by cost
of production of that portion of the supply whose total
necessary cost is greatest. Yes, 100; ! no, 25. /
8â General prosperity lies always in the direction of
high wages and low prices; Yes, 103; no, 30.
RECENTLY the Massachusetts Single Tax
League gave a banquet to a large number of
university professors and political economists.
It was a festive as well as a learned gathering, and
the oratory after the coffee was of a high order. The
most interesting feature of the occasion, however,
however, was the report of the chairman, which
served as the text for all the speeches of the evening.
This report consisted of replies received to a circular
sent out by the league to 668 economists constituting
the American Economic Association asking their
judgment upon certain^ economic propositions on
which the league desires to obtain something like an.
agreement. The questions and the answers were
as follows:
!â "Wages," while apparently, drawn from capital and
dependent upon capital, are primarily the product of
labor; hence it is practically true that labor produces
its own wages. Yes, 109; no, 24.
2â "Ground rent" is what land is worth for use. Yes,
122: no, 3. ; X: Â¦Â£Â¦':
ECONOMIC PROPOSITIONS.
The Supreme Court of Georgia having decided that
prohibition counties of the State cannot exclude
liquor in original packages the people of Caters
ville, where Sam Jones lives, met in mass-meeting
and resolved . that if any man brought whisky into
their town they would make an "original package of
hime," and while the threat is vague it seems to mean
Wasps are said to be very affectionate,
but few people care to be the recipients
of their fond caresses.
Investigations made by The Call lead to the con
clusion that the tract, so far from being worth the
price of $100 an acre which is now being asked for
the 2500 acres offered, is in reality not worth so much
as $50 an acre for which the original 5000 acres was
offered. A similar conclusion has evidently been
reached by the commission, for at the convention
called in San Jose to promote the scheme Attorney
Ross of Redwood City stated that such portions of
the Big Basin as lie in San Mateo County were as
sessed at from $6 to $7 per acre. The assessments in
Santa Cruz County can hardiy be much more, ex
cept possibly for some parts of the tract where the
timber is exceptionally valuable.
The people of California are as much in favor as
ever of preserving a redwood forest. They are will
ing to pay a fair price for it and to conserve it at
public expense as a park for the recreation of the
people and the delight of coming generations. That
feeling' however, 3s not going to lead them into be
coming the dupes of a land speculation. Public
opinion sustains the commission in its refusal to en
ter into any such bargain as that proposed by the
schemers. The Big Basin is not the only giant red
wood forest in the State. If it be not offered upon
fair terms the State can amend the act and seek else-
Enough has been made known to justify the belief
that an effort is being made to carry through a
scheme b}' which the State will be made to pay for
the lands offered a sum far in excess of their value.
The proposition now submitted to the commission
is not the same that was presented to the Legisla
ture. At the time the measure was being urged upon
the Legislature a pamphlet was prepared by the ad
vocates of the park in which was contained this state
ment: "We propose a $500,000 park because that
will include all of the 14,000 acres in the Big Basin.
This forest is surrounded by a range of hills, and it
is because of the difficulty of access that it has not
been despoiled. We asked for an appropriation of
S250.000 because this amount of money will buy a
solid tract of 5000 acres suitable for a park. This
is the least acreage, according to our estimate, that
will fulfill the requirements -of a State park and in
clude the holdings of the lumbermen who have gob
bled up the finest and most beautiful timber, etc."
In the face of that statement the advocates of the
scheme now ask the commission to pay $250,000 for
a tract of but 2500 acres. In other words, the price
has been doubled, and the commission is asked to
agree to it.
WHEN following the controversy which has
arisen over the delay of the State commis
sion in purchasing the lands offered for the
Big Basin park the public should be careful not to
confuse the issue. It is not a question whether or no
the act of the Legislature shall be carried out or
whether it is advisable that a park of giant redwoods
be preserved from destruction. Upon those ques
tions there is no controversy. The sole point at is
sue is whether the price demanded for the lands is
a fair one. That is an issue which can be settled
rightly only after a thorough investigation of the
lands and of their market value, and the commission
is acting rightly in refusing to complete the purchase
until it is assured that the State will receive the full
value of its money.

HIS Majesty the German Emperor has decided that the schooner yacht
building at Shooters Island, New York, shall be named the Meteor, and
Captain Hubert von Rebeur Paschwitz, the German Naval Attache at
Washington, has so advised Messrs. Cary, Smith and Barbey, the designers
.of the vessel. , " >Â¦;-â¢' *
j The Meteor seems to be a favorite name with the Emperor. His first yacht
to be so called was the old cutter .Thistle, which essayed to win the America's
Cup ' in 1887 and was rather ignomlnlously beaten by the Volunteer. When the
Thistle, came into his Majesty's possession she was altered in many ways and
fashioned into as modern a craft of the time as was possible, j
' After using her a few years, or In; 1896, there was turned out for the Emperor
by G. L. Watson, designer, and Messrs. D. & W; Henderson, builders, at Glas
gow, a new Meteor, this time a cutter of 88.95 feet water line, 100 feet between per
pendiculars and 24.3 feet beam. Her construction and racing career* as a cutter for
three years is still referred to by the yachtsmen of Great . Britain , with evident
pleasure, as her advent did much to increase the Interest in the sport there. Amer
ican yachtsmen, too, will readily recall the cutter's many contests and do not for
get the boom that the participation of the Emperor's yacht gave to yachting: not
only there but the world over.
During this time the Emperdr parted with his first Meteor,, the old Thistle,
and she is now owned at Kiel and is known as the Comet.
Following the bent of the yachting mind abroad at the time, the Emperor, in
1899, caused the Meteor's cutter rig to be changed to that of a yawl, and she is
still rigged in that way. The change caused her water line length to be in
creased to 89.50 feet, although her lineal rating, by judicious distribution of the
sail area, .was slightly reduced. Her record as a. yawl in racins matters sustained
her previous excellent t-eputation. Last year she started five times only and won
two first prizes, of the value of Â£122.
.Under the direction of *Theodore /35. Ferris, superintendent of construction at
Shooters Island, the plating of the Meteor is being hurried with all the speed that
is compatible with the best of workmanship. If nothing happens the yacht will
be ready to be placed in the water on February 20.
A. CART SMITH, THE DESIGNER OF THE GERMAN RULER'S AMER
ICAN BUILT RACING CRAFT, THE LAUNCHING OF WHICH IS SOON
The situation gives encouragement to the hope
of those who desire to bring the contending parties
into negotiations. Of course the offers of mediation
will have to be made in such a way as not to offend
the national pride of, either party. The Boer leaders
can hardly be expected -to.- admit that their cause is
hopeless, as they would have to do if they appeared
as suppliants for mediation, nor' can the British be
expected to make even an implied confession of
weakness on their part. The consequence is that
such mediation as is offered will hardly be made offi
cially. Neither the Government of Holland nor our
own Government, which has been approached on
the subject, will avowedly take part in the matter. All
tha^t can be expected is thatÂ«.the contending ' parties
will be induced to treat with one another upon a
basis essentially different from the extreme demands
of either. A year ago such a negotiation could not be
brought about, but now it is quite possible that King
Edward's desire for peace may accomplish it.
The peace party in Great Britain that favors a
frank concession of full independence to the Trans
vaal as a sovereign state, is too weak to effect much.
In Great Britain, therefore, the country may be said
to be divided between the party that advocates peace
obtained by concession of self-government and the
party that advocates the complete subjection of- the
Boers now in the field, to be followed after the .es
tablishment of peace by such forms of colonial gov
ernment as may be deemed best. It will be seen that
each party, means to grant a measure of self-govern
ment to the Boers, and the only ; question is whether
it shall be offered while the Boers are still in arms.
It is known that King Edward is eagerly desirous
of attaining peace before his coronation. That de
sire has been made knowr^ to his_Ministers and to the
public, and consequently the Ministry is now ready
to abate much of the severity of the terms they at
first announced. . How much of independence they
would be willing to grant the Boers has of course
never been declared. L'ord Rosebery, however, has
counseled a grant to the. Transvaal of self-govern
ment under the crown similar to that now enjoyed by
Canada. The grant is to be accompanied by a guar
antee of a vote of money to repay the; loss caused to
the,Boer farmers by the destruction of' their homes,
and a further guarantee that military government of
the country for the purpose of maintaining order un
til the establishment of a settled government 7 shall
not be indefinitely prolonged. -C''
WHILE both the British Ministry and the
Boer leaders in Europe have disclaimed any
connection with the efforts of the .Govern
ment of Holland to bring about negotiations for
peace, it is quite likely they will be not unwilling to
listen to such proposals. The war threatens to be
come a chronic strife between two races rather than
a contest between two nations. The Boers can hardly
hope to attain independence without the aid of some
foreign power, and it is now fairly certain that such
aid will not be given. Â¦Â¦Â¦* On the other hand/it has been
proven that the British cannot speedily put an end
to a struggle which, is costing so dearly in treasure
and blood. Each side, therefore, must be weary of
the strife and ready to listen to terms of compro
mise. .'* ;'â¢<Â» v' /,.':
BRITISH AND BOERS.
It may be that Mayor Schmitz in his present zeal
is but demonstrating once more the efficacy of the
proverbial new broom and that he will change later
on. That, however, is an issue which need not con
cern us now. Judged by his course thus far in this
respect he has done well. Let him have the credit
that is due him.
. Should the courts decide against him the action of
the Mayor will still be a potent influence for good.
He has revealed the existence of a gross evil in mu
nicipal affairs and pointed out the proper remedy
that of removing from office any one found to be in
competent or unworthy. Having had the good re
sults of that policy demonstrated, the people will de
mand a continuance of it. Should the courts hold
that the Mayor is not clothed with power to make
removals, the people will then seek for an authority
that has. - Somewhere under our form of government
there must* be an officer or a tribunal vested with
power to remove^ unworthy men from office, and it
will be the duty of the courts to make it known.
Should the courts uphold the Mayor in his eff or,ts we
may expect a radical change for the better in the mu
nicipal service. There will be less racetrack gambling
and more attention to public business than we have
had for a long time past in the civic administration.
It will' doubtless be found that when the officials give
their time and their energy to their work the city
can get along with fewer employes than are now
drawing salaries and eating taxes. Thus there will
come not only a greater efficiency in the service but
an economy that will be highly acceptable to the
taxpayers. Two good ends will be attained by one
and the same means, and the Mayor will have gained
for his administration the esteem of all that portion
of the public whose esteem is worth having.
Such being the case the Mayor has acted well in be
ginning such work of reform as he purposes to un
dertake by clearing the offices of men who neglect
their duty or in any way violate the law. His firm
ness in making removals despite the antagonism of
the bosses gives encouragement to the hopes of
thosewho have expected most of his administration.
It wins for him the approval of all good citizens,,
whether they were for him or against him during the
progress of the campaign, and goes far to awaken
a popular confidence that in the administration of . his
office he will live up to his campaign pledges and
truly and faithfully serve the general welfare.
Good government is dependent upon good men.
No system of administration can be devised that willj
compel incompetent or unworthy men to give a
rightful service to the public. So long as political
bosses are" permitted to fill public offices with their
followers without regard for fitness for the place, just
so long will administration be defective and tha,pub
lic suffer. With worthy officials almost any system of
government willwork well, but when the unworthy,
are in office the best possible form of government
proves inadequate to provide for the public good and
the interests of the people.
MAYOR SCHMITZ has made a good start in
thctask of providing the city with better
government. His efforts thus far made to
rid the public offices of unworthy officials merit pub
lic approval." Whether his course be sustained by the
courts or not he will have the credit of undertaking
to improve municipal administration by eliminating
from it some at least of the evils resulting from boss
politics. That credit will be his and public support
will go with it so long as he Tcmains true to the pol
icy he has announced and has thus far put into prac
tice.
EMPEROR'S NEW YACHT
TO BE NAMED METEOR
- -

Every season has its feature, but on re
viewing the records for many years back
it is difficult to think of any work of fic
tion at any rate which has had what could
be called a long life. In talking with a
prominent publisher on this subject he
gave it as his opinion that, roughly speak
ing a book gets only half the life It used
to have. Thus in the old days a novel, it
it was read by the public at all, would go
on being read for a year at least. Now
adays a six months career is almost note
worthy, and one of three months Is not to
be despised. Not merely does this apply
to fiction, but. to science and all the
learned subjects as well, though, of
course, not In so marked a degree. A
work has hardly established itself to-day
when anotherâ rather more up-to-dateâ
comes out and eclipses it. In years back
a recognized book on botany, for in
stance, or some other subject, was certain
of long prosperity.
"What's In a title?" asked a well-known
novelist of a. publisher. "Simplicity should
be in it," was the reply. Well, simplicity
undoubtedly will be found in the title of
John Morley's biography of Gladstone,
which will be called "The Life of William
Ewart Gladstone." Simple and expressive,
too, is the title which has been chosen for
the- official diary of the Prince and Prin
cess of Wales' colonial tour, which will be
contained In these three words only,
"Web of Empire."
Arthur Morrison, who will publish In
the.' autumn another East End novel,
called "The Hole In the Wall," is a writer
of many moods. It was he who invented
Martin Hewitt, a detective in fiction, who,
it will be remembered, rivaled in his
day Vidocq and Sherlock Holmes.- Morri
son was one of the distinguished band ot
young writers who are known as "Hen
ley's young men," who included, J. M.
Barrle. Rudyard Kipling, G. S. Street,
Charles Whibley, G. W. Steevens, Georgo
Wyndham and the present Viceroy of In
dia, Lord Curzon of Kedlestone. Morrison,
who is not yet 40 year3 old. is the antithe
sis of the regular methodical worker. Ho
sometimes finds it impossible to write a
line for months, together. Then follows a
burst of activity, during which he will
sometimes write for seventeen hours out
of the twenty-four.
One of the most interesting sales of the
seasonâ at any rate to the literary worldâ,
will be that which" will take place in
March at Sotheby, "Wilkinson & Hodges'
rooms. It will consist of modern books
and works of reference belonging to thb
late Sir Walter Besant. Each volume con
tains* one of the late novelist's tasteful
bookplates. At the same sale will also be
disposed the MSS. of most of Sir Walter's
works.
Captain Maurice Grant, whose military
sketches have attracted so much atten
tion, has now arrived in England from
South Africa. He is to write some fur
ther war sketches, which undoubtedly will
be eagerly anticipated. But necessarily
the task of assisting to compile the of
ficial history ot the campaign in South At.
rica, for which his valuable services have
been retained, will fill most of his time. It
is calculated that the history will keep
Colonel Henderson and those working
with him occupied for at least three
years. Â¦ â¢
A very touching thing about a novel
which Messrs. Hutchinson are to publish
is that the author recently lost his sight.
The novel is one about Boer and native
life in South Africa, by a man who knows
that country exceedingly well. He is
George Hansby Russell, the author of a
novel in a like vein, "Under the Sjambok,'*
which appeared some time ago.' His
new work, also written from personal ob-;
servation, has the 'title "On Commando in
1879." Russell served in the Znlu war and

Miss Habermehl claims that Morgan
and I she became engaged last . July. At
that time, she did not know he was a mar
ried man.' Subsequently she heard he was
married and charged him with deception.
He, admitted then, she says/that he had
a little daughter, but said he was a wid
ower and brought her a locket with his
daughter's picture and - induced her to
wear it. Later Â¦ his affection cooled, she
claims,? and he told: her, that, he-, was a
married man. Â¦ ; ; :",

by x Miss Habermehl and was at once re
leased on . $300 cash ball.
| Isaac J.\ Morgan, familiarly called
"Jack," , a man well known about town
and reputed to be wealthy, has been, made
defendant in a breach of promise jj suit
filed yesterday by Miss Tillie Habermehl,
cashier in a Stockton-street restaurant.

. BREACH OP " PROMISE
The defendant's attorney argued that In
view of the admissions made by Cashier
Bundy, the charge of obtaining money by
false pretenses could not be sustained.
The checks were given here by the de
fendant, believing that they would be
honored by. the Bank of Santa. Monica.
It did not matter whether or not the de
fendant had* a draft for $2000 in the Ne>
vada Bank, he could not be prosecuted
here, but he could be, possibly, in Santa
Monica. He moved for a dismissal, but
the Judge reserved his decision till Tues
day.
In regard to the Homan check. Homan
admitted that he had paid the defendant
$70 altogetherâ $40 at one time, $20 at an
other and again $10. The defendant's at
torney also made the point in that caa*
that the charge could only be a misde
meanor, as the highest sum paid at one
.time was $40.
The checks were declared worthless, as
Hespeler had no funds in the Bank of
Santa, Monica. C. I* Bundy, cashier of
that bank, was called as a witness. He
testified in effect that he met Hespeler
in Santa Monica and Hespeler had told
him that be had deposited a draft for
$5000 for . collection in the Nevada Bank
of this city. On that representation Bun
dy gave him a check book of the Bank
of Santa Monica and a printed form of
the bank, which was filled in, showing;
that Hespeler had that amount with the
Nevada Bank on deposit. Bundy declined
to say whether or not ho had authorized
Hespeler to draw on the Bank of Santa
Monica.
The preliminary examination of A. E.
Hespeler, alias Hess, on two charges of
obtaining money 15y false pretenses was
held before Judge Conlan yesterday. The
complaining witnesses were A. Van Loon
of the Hotel Franklin, on whom he passed
a check for $150. and Louis C. Homan.

Saunders and the girl's mother were in
court yesterday. He claimed that he and
the girl's mother entered into a contract
marriage while living in Sacramento in
1897. He produced it in court. It was
written on a piece of dirty paper and was
signed by both parties. Saunders boasted
ol his craving for morphine and thought
It was nobody's business. He said he had
not sent the girl to school because the
schools were overcrowded. He was op
posed to the girl being sent to a public
institution, but when she burst Into a fit

The note was handed to Secretary

Newbro's Herpicide Destroys the
Dandruff Germ Permanently
and Cures Baldness.
Quinine and rum and a whole lot of
other things are pleasant to rub on the
ecalp after washing it free of dandruff,
but not one preparation of the general
run cures dandruff and falling hair. It Is
necessary to kill that germ, to be perma-
nently cured of dandruff, and to stop
falling hair. Newbro's Herpicide will
positively destroy that germ, bo that
there can be no more dandruff, and so
that the hair will grow luxuriantly. "De-
stroy the cause, and you remove the ef-
fect."

Men Don't Understand How They
Suffer When They Cry, "Oh, Don't
Speak to Me."
r All manner of extravagant expressions are possible "when a woman's
nerves are overwrought.
I The spasm at the top of the wind pipe or bronchial tubes, "ball
| rifling in the throat," violent beating of the heart, laughing and crying
j by turns, muscular spasms (throwing the arms about), frightened by the
. most insignificant occurrences â arp all symptoms of a hysterical condi-
tion and serious derangement of the female organs.
Any. female complaint mayproduce hysterics, which must be re-
garded as a symptom only. The cause, however, yields quickly to
I Lydia E. Piukham's Vegetable Compound, which acts at once upon
the organ afflicted and the nerve centres, dispelling effectually all those
distressing symptoms.
Mrs. Lewis Says: "I Feel Like a New Person, {
Physically and Mentally."
"Deak Mrs. Pdjkham: â I wish to speak a good word for Lydia B.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. For years I had ovarian trouble and
suffered everything from nervousness, severe headache, and pain in back and
abdomen. I had consulted different physicians, but decided to try your medi-
cine, and I soon found it was giving me much relief. I continued its use and
now am feeling like a new person, physically and mentally, and am glad to
add one more testimonial to the value of your remedy." â Mbs. M. H. Lewis,
2106 Valentine Ave., Tremont, New York, N.Y. Â»
I Writing to Mrs. Pinkham is the quickest and surest way to
get the right advice about all female troubles. Her address is
Lynn, Mass. She advises -women free. Following is an instance:
;* Mrs. Haven's First Letter to Mrs. Pinkham.
' " Dk ajj Mbs. Putkham : â I would like your advice in regard to my
troubles. I suffer every month at time of menstruation, and flow so much,
and for so long that I become very weak, also get very dizzy.^ I am troubled
with a discharge before and after menses, have pains in ovaries so bad some-
times that I can hardly get around, have sore feeling in lower part of bowels,
pain in back, bearing-down feeling, a desire to pass urine frequently, with
pains in passing it ; have leucorrhcea, headache, fainting spells, and some-
times have hysteria. My blood is not in good condition. Hoping to hear
from you, I am, Mrs. Emma Haves, 2508 South Ave., Council Bluffs, Iowa."

VDkab Mbs. Pinkham: â I wish to express my gratitude for what you
have done for me. I suffered. for four years with womb troubles. Every
month I flowed very badly. I got so bad that I could hardly do my work.
Was obliged to sit or lie down most of the time. I doctored for a Ion?
time, but obtained no relief. I began using your remedies â Lydia E.

Last Sunday several members . of the
San Francisco Tacht Club went over to
Sausallto and accomplished a considerable
amount of work on the Â¦ main hall of the
clubhouse. The annual meeting and elec
tion , of officers for the coming year will
be held on Wednesday evening. February
12, in the Merchants'. Exchange. There are
at present no signs of any opposition to
the regular ticket, -which will doubtless
be elected without change.
. After the ; meeting . the members were
the guests, of the newly elected officers at
a downtown restaurant.
The report of the retiring, commodore,
Harry D. Hawks, gave many figures,
showing the comparative amounts spent
during the last five years upon the regat
tas, ciam bakes, opening ana closing* Jinks
and other entertainments. It also com
mented on the Inadequate water supply
and on the fact that the club may In fu
ture have to pay x for power for its electric
lights, which has hitherto been supplied
by the California Northwestern Railway.
At the Paciflo Interclub Yacht Associa
tion's regatta the Corinthians won four
out of five Macdonough , cups and took
first place, In five out of six classes.,
The treasurer's report showed that
while the income of the club has steadily
Increased â¢ its . expenditures have grown
proportionately. In- order to wipe off the
indebtedness and create a f una to meet
expenses during the early part of the sea
son It was strongly urged by F. E. Beolc
that. an assessment be levied. A long and
Â¦omewhat bitter discussion arosa upon
this question, but at last It was decided
to be the sense of the meeting that an
assessment of $6 should be levied on eactt
member, payable at the rate of 50 cents
per month. - Then the purpose to -which,
the assessment should be devoted .was
warmly debated, the conclusion being that
the assessment should go Into the club
treasury and be expended according to the
best Judgment of the directors. The last
and most Interesting matter discussed
was the course to be pursued by the Co
rinthians In case of a challenge being re
ceived from another club for the Perpet
ual cup, which was won by . Westerfeld
and Morrow's sloop .Aeolus and success
fully defended last year by Frank Stone's
Presto. Ex-Commodore Carl "Westerfeld
said the proper plan is for the club. In the
event of receiving a challenge, to notify Its
yacht-owning members that a raca will be
held and. to select the fastest boat to de
fend" the . trophy. He spoke strongly
against the expenditure of the funds of
the club In i fitting out - or preparing any
private owner's yacht for the contest. The
outcome of. a- heated discussion was that
the directors were instructed to meet any
challenge that. may be sent in the most
energetic manner, and to use their best
judgment;ln the matter" of selecting and
preparing" a yacht to uphold the credit of
the club. . .
The annual meeting of the Corinthians
In Red Men's Hall last "Wednesday even
ing was the largest and stormiest that has
been held for several years. One orvtwo
jocular attempts were made to introduce
other lists of nominees, but nothing came
of them, and the regular ticket was elect
ed without change and unanimously. The
'report of the secretary showed that the
club has a list of 246 active, 13 absent and
4 honorary members. The fleet comprises
45 sloops, 9 yawls and 3 launches, besides
a large number of rowboata and yachts'
tenders. . Â¦
The puppies ax* eligible far the Belle
Brandon cup, which Is to be run on the
22d lnst. at Union Park, and the older
dogs -are classed for the California plats
stake of thÂ« same date. Followers of the
Â¦port are anxious to have tli* kennel re
main to compete In these events and no
effort will be spared to gain the new
owner's consent to that end.
A stake la being: advertised to he run
at Vallejo under the auspices of Con.
Mooney. The Vallejo Coursing' Club has
not given consent to Mooney to hold this
meeting, nor has the California coursing
committee sanctioned the affair. Own
ers who run their dogs will probably bo
ruled off by the coursing committee.
Amarosa, the dam of the noted young
stake winners Freeze Out and Cold Shiv

near Ocean View last week.
E. D. Morden, who, with Charles Gas

The- purchaser is Ralph Orthwein, a
wealthy young member of the St. Louis
Pastime Club. Mr. Orthwein has but
lately become a patron of the sport of
the leash, being drawn Into the game by
6. Lacy Crawford of the club. Mr. Craw
ford is an ardent adherent at the sport
and Is the owner of a. kennel of cham
pion coursers in St. Louis. Ho Is known
as a true sportsman and his declaration
that he Intends to make his city the
coursing center of America augurs well
for coursing In St. Louis. The deal calls
for the transfer of Slsquoc, Tiburon, Tap
ioca, Lady Clare. Elista and Imported
Fine Form; three Emin Pasha-Maggie N
puppies and five Fortuna Favente-Wana
saplings. The older dogs are well known
performers and will ba a valuable addi
tion to the kennels of the St. Louis Cours
ing Club.
The new - owner has sent on 'William
Egan to take possession of thm grey
hounds.
""D. J. Healey, the well known Califor
nlan leashman, has disposed of his ken
nel of fast greyhounds and has retired
from the coursing game, for a time at
least. Soma weeks ago an offer was
made to the Prince of Petaluma for his
entire kennel and negotiations were
brought to that point where the transfer
was all but completed. At the last mo
ment, however, a misunderstanding re
sulted In the deal being declared oft. The
persons Interested opened negotiations
again and In a short time a change of
"ownership was effected.
BOWING ATTRACTS ; '
â¢ MANY. NEW- JfOU.OWEjRS
Eugene Geary's greyhound, -Palo Alto, owing to recent In
juries, may not be able to follow up. his sensational victories
on the coursing field. - At the present time no dog. stands out
above his fellows in speed as did the black and white* son of
Emin Pasha, hence ;the successor to the title oÂ£ champion is
hard to name.
It seems accepted as a ;,fact that Frank Stone s yacht
Presto will defend the San Francisco Perpetual Challege cup
against the yacht now being built by a syndicate of members
of the San Francisco Tacht Club. The Presto won the Mac
donough cup' in the 30-foot class at the annual Interclub re
gatta last year, defeating A. E. Chapman's sloop Helen. She
Is the fastest 30-footer In the bay.
George F. Whitney has held the tennis " championship sÂ»
long that It seems no one can wrest the honor from him. This
year men who held the championship a decade ago and a
number of new players will be out for the -blue ribbon of the
courts. Champion Whitney will â¢ find â¢ the competition^ keen
when he Is called to defend his title. , ' . 'â¢ â¢ Â¦,:Â¦
Otto Feudner is expected to maintain his standing as a
trap shot. His sensational work in the field during the duck
season shows he; has lost none of his skill with the double
barreled gun. â¢
Anthony Cadogan, the crack sprinter of the University of
California, will sport the â¢ blue and gold colors on Eastern cln
'der paths in competition with the fastest runners Yale, Har
vard and other great colleges can send forth. He has covered

Play on the tennis courts was light dur
ing the week because- of the extremely
coldweather. The feature of the week.was
the reappearance of Thomas. A. Driscoll,
ex-champion of the coast. Of all the
former champions who have again taken
up the game, Driscoll . has made by far
the best impression.- The latter was never
considered as good a player as Will Tay
lor when they were both at their best, but
Driscoll's game is -more effective against
the present cracks than either Tobln' a or
Taylor's.'.' . ''Â¦'.: "Â¦"Â¦;'.Â¦.
. The left-handed expert has not touched
a racket for five years, but i on his first
appearance, beat Carl Gardner, one of the
second-class men, with ease. On the fol
lowing day he beat Merle Johnson, one of
the best . men Â¦ In the first class, -.handily.
He plays a peculiar ; game and one that
is a great deal , more effective Â¦" than it
looks. Joe Dally, who is an authority on
tennis, is of the opinion that Driscoll with
a month's practice would be almost a
match for Champion Whitney.- . ,

day; They furnish everything except grun
and, shells and charge from $12 to $15 per
day per head. They never use larger than

40 yards. They advise shells loaded as
for ducks. They have a fine four-room
cottage and guarantee 'to take excellent
care of sportsmen from the time 'they ar
rive until they leave. They can handle

â¢ The prohibition of the sale of quail Is
expected to work wonders in replenishing
the supply of that game bird. â¢Â¦ The aver
age receipts in former . years . were 200
dozen, or 2400 birds per day. The aver
age was bardly more than 100 birds per
day during the past season owing to the
alertness of the officers -of the Fish and
Game Commission. Many arrests of vio
lators were made and. convictions secured,
thus deterring men from killing the birds
and sending them into the . market sur
reptitiously.
Birds are still plentiful, being in some
quarters a positive menace to the farm
ers. This .is particularly true about Grid
ley and Auburn, where they have to be
driven off the grain' at night.
The game .protectionists are anxious to
save the life of every duck they can, be
lieving one live bird to be worth more
than many dead ones; The majority of
the sportsmen who have shot over pre
serves during .the past, season are-satis
fied with the sport they enjoyed. The dry
season has kept the birds- in and about
the bay, thus providing good sport at all
times. : -' â¢â¢..:Â¦
The duck shooting season closed yester
day under the law passed by the last Leg
islature, which shortened' it one month.
There is a wide difference of opinion as
to the expediency of the new law. Be
tween the men who believe they should
be allowed to! shoot throughout the entire
year and those who would stop all. shoot
ing, for some years at least, there are all
shades of- opinion. Â¦ 'Â¦
The golfers from â¢ Southern California
were so well and numerously represented
at the first annual- Pacific Coast : cham
pionship meeting held on the Presidio
links last year that. great- hopes. are en
tertained that a goodly Â¦ number Â¦ of the
strongest golfers f ipm * San .- Francisco
Oakland, Burlingame and San Rafael will
fro down to Los Angeles .this, year. It is
believed that E.'R. Kolger, winner of the
championship, and John Lawson, runner
o- will make the trip. R. M. Fitzgerald,
W. P. Johnson,. F. 8. Stratton and some
other Oaklanders are also likely to enter
the contest. The Southern Californlans

The first eighteen holes of the first
home-and-home match of the season be
tween teams of men representing? the San
Francisco and Oakland Golf clubs will be
played this afternoon on the Presidio
links. The teams consist of eight men
from each club, this number having been
decided upon after considerable talk of
teams of as few as six or- as many.as a
dozen. Yesterday _- Captain 6. L. -.Abbot
Jr. of the San Francisco Golf Club and
Captain Orestes Pierce of the Oakland
Golf Club exchanged lists of teams, each
man on the teams having a number' from
1 to S. Number 1 of the visiting: team
will play against' number -1 of the home
team, number. 2 against number 2 and so
on. If any member of elthemeam is ab
sent the opposing team will score two
holes. The Presidio course is in excel
lent condition just now, the -turf being
strong and holding: the ball up well. The
second elgnteen holes of the first match
Trtll -toe played next Saturday on the links
at Adams Point, Oakland, and the scores
of the two days' play will be reckoned to
gether. Later in the season a second
thirty-six-hole match will be played un
der the same conditions. If both matches
chould be won by the same team the sil
ver trophy will become the permanent
property of the club to which the winning
team belongs. If each club should win one
match a deciding match over eighteen
holes will be played on neutral links. This
has happened only once, the deciding
match in 1899 having been played on the
links of the Burlingame Country. Club.
Last Monday morning, In eplte of , the
cold north wind which swept over the
Presidio course, seven ladies of the San
Francisco Golf Club took part In a handi
cap over eighteen holes. . Mrs. R. Oilman
Brown played from scratch and was in
excellent form. Miss Edith McBean,
aided by a good handicap, made the low
est net score and. won the prize. The
other contestants were Miss Alice Hager,
Miss Florence Ives, Mrs. L. T. Scott, Miss
Sarah Drum and Miss Edith Chesebrough.
For the present the Sausallto Golf Club
has given up part of its course and is
keeping up only five holes. It Is the In
tention of the tournament oommittee to
hold a handicap contest, medal play, some
time during the present month.
Next month will be an active and an in
teresting: month for the golfers of Cali
fornia. The second annual contest for the
men's amateur championship of the Pa
cific Coast Golf Association will be held
on the links of the Los. Angeles Country
Club on March 3, 4. 5 and 6. Contestants

tries through the secretaries of their
clubs. Entries must be received .by, T. P.,

The narrow escape from death of Chief
Sullivan of ' the' Fire Department and his
telegraph operator~*on Thursday evening
In a collision with an electric car at the
corner of Grant avenue and Post, street
caused much discussion yesterday. It is
the consensus of opinion that if the fire
alarm whistles had been blowing the ac
cident would not .; have occurred. Those
who are in' favor of seeing the fire alarm
whistle again installed put forward the
argument; that when the whistles are
blowing. grlpmen. and motormen of street
cars become . cautious ; and are on \ the
lookout for; fire : engines, and officers hur
rying, in their buggies to the scene of the
blaze. , Â¦ Â¦
Chief Sullivan is in. favor of the fire
alarm whistle being abolished. He says
that San Francisco was the last city of
any size to do away with this system of
warning people that there was a fire
.burning in their city.: '. ,, ?â¢
"I think It was a good plan to abolish

midnight on November 14, when Wade

his hands into his pockets and Wade
fired the fatal shot. â¢ The murderers were
arrested three days later in a â¢ lodging
house through; information given by the
woman who kept the house./ When ar
rested each man accused the other of
being the murderer, but after a few
weeks Wade confessed that he . himself
fired ths shot. .
Wade wa3 : born near Pittsburg, ' Pa.,

his victim 'Â¦ were both under 21 years of

of his fellow-murderer Dalton and partly
to the reading of: a passage in Paul's

Dalton paused and Wade took a cigar
from his pocket and threw It into the
crowd. Several hands were reached for it
and "Jack" laughed when.4he spectators
failed to catch .the souvenir. Turning
aside, he grasped the noose which was
swinging by his head. He felt the rope,
pinched it as if to see if It were real
hemp, winked, smiled and laughed at the
spectators and said audibly: "It is
tough." - â¢
"Boys, I have only a few words to say,"
said Wade, stepping forward; "only a few
words to say, and I mean what I say.
Now," with eyes glistening with tears,
"don't any of you follow in the track, of
'Jack.' Now don't you do it! (determined
ly). You might think I am happy here.
I am not. I am here because I can't do
any better in this world. What would

No one in the crowd felt dispose** to an

his trap. Standing there, he again spoke:
"Don't none of you follow my tracks,"
ho advised.
Black caps were produced and at the
sight of -them Wade said:
"Good-by one and good-by all." .
The caps and nooses were then ad
justed. '
"Good-by, Jack," called Dalton^

"Temptation is the ruin of many a man

"I pray for you, my dear boys, and if
there is an infidel in this crowd I'll give
my life for his saving. I'll do it, I'll do

After the Sight Gardner naturally ex

who represents him, offered to make a
match and will bet $2500 on the side. He
will mtet Lou Houseman, who represents
Root, and another meeting between the
men may be arranged.
There was a slight dispute when the
boxen entered the ring, as Root had
brought his own gloves out trom Chicago.
Gardner would not allow him to use them,
insisting on the club gloves, for which
each man had been measured. Root did
not press the matter.
Root was fceconded by Teddy Alexander,
Ed Holloy and "Western" Al Smith. In
Gardner's corner were Greggains, Jce Mll

In the first round Gardner was on the
aggresEive from the start. He seemed

tors in the first round. He was cool,
good natured and always ready for any
move on the part of his opponent. He
has a lightning right hand, which he
shoots out from any position in which he
may find himself.
Gardr.er did not seem nearly as pood
as when he fojigat Carter here in October.
i'rem the moment proceedings were open
ed m the first round be was over anxious
and was wild in his delivery. This is
partly explained by the fact that Hoot
proved immt-asureabJy faster than Carter
as a boxer. He seemed all over Gardner's
KBVti throughout the fight, rendering the
majority of his blows ineffective. In the
lirst round Hoot closed Gardner's left
eye. This practically rendered his left
hand poweness as he could not place> It
properly, many of his blows going wide
of the intended mark. Gardner v/as
vicious throughout but Root met all his
advances and proved thoroughly game.
Gardner Seems Overanxious.
The spectators cheered the decision,
cheered I'.cot and cheered the referee.
They hootc-i Gardner as he left the ring
to make his way to his dressing room.
It seemed in tne air after the nrst rouad
that one of the men would win on a
foul. They had been fighting but a few
ir.orr.cnrs when Root's seconds commenced
claiming a foul. In explanation of Gard
ner's methods Alec Greggains said after
the fight that with his abnormal reach
the Lowell nan is likely to hit low when
e winging for the body, but that at no
time v.as there any intentional fouling on
iiis part.
There was a fierce rally, when Root
suddenly went to the floor .apparently
writhing in agony. The house was in a
turmoil by this time, the spectators being
on their feet, yelling â¢'Foul!" "Foul!"
Referee Wand waited for several seconds,
and Rcot, stl.il remaining oil the canvas,
he declared hira the victor.
When the end came Gardner -was in dis
tress, and it seemed only a matter of a
ehort time when -Ire- must go down and
out. He opened proceedings in the last
round with a rush,' as is his custom, but
Koot met all his advances. Root tried a

over-anxious," and apparently wanted to
land one blow that would take some of
the steam out of his opponent. Root
backed away for a time and seemed per
fectly cool and collected. He escaped
G-ardnfer's wild swings and then came
back at him with some hard jabs in the
face. Just before the round closed Root
cut Gardner's eye and sent a stinging
right to the body.
Gardner was first to get in action in the
second round, scoring right and left to
the body, but doing no damage. Root com
menced to play for Gardner's sore eye
and did not Improve either its beauty or
its usefulness. Root sent In a right cross
to the chin for a knockout, but it just
missed its mark. This was clearly Root's
round, as he did by far the most effective
work.
The betting, which had been 10 to 7 on
Gardner, shifted to 10 to 8 on Root. The
third round was full of rough work on
both sides, Root's seconds claiming a foul
several times.
Gardner knocked Root down i early in
the fourth round and, thinking fhe had
him on the down grade, went at him vi
ciously. Root came back strongly and
soon had Gardner in distress. Root tried
several times for his right swing, but the

Gardner was getting desperate and
missed a wild swing for the head, taking
a hard one In return. Root followed this
up with two rights to the body. Ha

The action of the committee came up
for ratification last evening and . created
much; discussion. It appears that the
architects who did not . receive prizes for
their labors are disgruntled and have
made a demand upon the society for re
muneration. It now devolves upon the
fhill 110 *'*^ t Â« he sodety.to -say whether
these architects have a just claim. In
the meantime further plans will be ad
vertised, for and the society, expects to
erect a modern hospital.
The report submitted by the , president
was an interesting one. It showed that
the society s assets had increased $9627 14
and that the total assets of the organiza

$20,600 was paid out - in charities. The

question to decide for the members of

annual meeting of the society last night
that the committee appointed to secure
plans for a' new German Hospital and
award prizes â¢ to those architects who
merited them concluded that the plans
submitted did not ; reach the . standard.
Instead of awarding 'the five prizes of
fered to the competitors, the committee
awarded but two second -prizes of $1000

best plans. . - -

When city property is included within lands
proposed to be acquired for park purposes the

It Is not necessary to declare the necessity
of acquiring the Improvements on lands pro
posed to be acquired.
City Attorney Lane filed an opinion yes
terday regarding the preliminary steps to
be taken In the matter of submitting: the
questions of the acquisition of public util
ities and the purchase of Improvements
to the people at a bond election. Accord
ing to the opinion, the declaratory ordi
nances- already passed are nugatory, be
cause plans and estimates on the Im
provements were not obtained. New or
dinances will therefore have to be passed
after the legal requirements are complied
with. The opinion says:
The plans and estimates for any public util
ity must come from the Board of Works and
shall come to the Supervisors through the City
Engineer.
The Board of Supervisors, and not a com
mittee of the board, must request plans,, esti
mates and appraisement's by resolution ap
proved by the Mayor.
The completed plans must be- actually filed
with the Supervisors before the board can act
upon the essential declaratory ordinances As
a special election must be called In two weeks
after final publication the time would be insuf
ficient to obtain such plans.
".STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Jan. 31-
One of -the . Important . results of Mrs
Stanford's ; last trip abroad will be seen
next Monday when the Stanford Museum
will be again opened to the public. No
visitors have been admitted during the
past six weeks, because a large force of
workingmen has been placing in order
numerous collections of antique relics
curloa and art- specimens procured In for
eign countries by, the university's bene
factress. .,'Â¦"<;'...;:
.The two large* annexes to the museum
which were built over two years ago are
now being used for the first timeâ one
being devoted to the natural history de
partment â¢; and , the other containing the
Egyptian and; Roman relics. A great
many specimens of Roman art have been
purchased and these will be unpacked and
put m place soon after Mrs. Stanford's
return from the East, v â¢
â¢One of the. most valuable relics' that
have. been acquired by the museum is an
immense vase of Egyptian alabaster. The
vase, with its marble pedestal, stands
more than eight feet high, the bowl It
self being four feet in height and three
in diameter. It is the work of two Egyp
tian brothers who carved and polished the
beautiful vase, with its arms of intertwin
ing serpents, from a huge block of stone
and presentedÂ»lt to the famous Pope
Gregory XIII in the sixteenth century
The relic was inherited from the pontiff
by his relatives, and Mrs. Stanford pur
chased it from some of the descendants
of the family. It is, therefore, of great
historic : as well as artistic value.

The second recital of' Josef Hofmann
given yesterday afternoon at the Colum
bia Theater brought out an : even Â¦ larger
and vastly more enthusiastic crowd . than
greeted the young virtuoso, at his first re
cital. "Not being a bird, I- couldn't be. in
two places at once," as Sir. Boyle Roche
says, and I missed . half of Â¦ the,. Hofmann
recital while listening to "New
World" symphony , down at the Grand
Opera-house. But I did not; miss the Ru
binstein "Barcarolle" that was fcivenwith
a limpid purity of tone, an exquisite-sym
pathy and repose . that made " the one
number worth coming miles .-. to ' hear. -It
has been said that > though 'Mr. Hofmann
is eclectic in his sympathies he plays- a
better Rubinstein' than any other com
poser, and it looks that way. The "Bar
carolle" was a gem, perfectly
perfectly rendered.. I was ; also :in . time
to hear the Chopin Polonaise in A minor,
with its brilliantly handled^ octaves Â¦ and
splendid swing. And the two ; Polish
songs in G flat major and G major' that
followed, the latter dear to us here from
Mme. Sembrich's exquisite version, : were
rendered .with delicate charm and." dis
tinction. Chopin, particularly.- in his more
heroic mood, is, especially grateful to',hls
brilliant young /countryman.' and yet , an
other is Liszt, ~whose somewhat thin-py
rotechnics, in the. "Second Rhapsody,"
played for all they -were worth by; the
artist, "closed the programme.'. But -. Mr.
Hofmann was bravoed Into giving an en
core, afterward, the third of the after

iTiey haa evidence that in the first
century people were not only cruel to the
foreigner, but they ostracized and shut
him out of the community to which he
had come for asylum. There was a bar*
rier maintained between the Christian' and
the Jew in early time3 with the object of
keeping out the customs of the Israelite
and in this connection the lecturer demon
strated a condition in Spain, where the
Jewlsn community had proved their value
as agriculturists, but they were not wel
come m spite of the immense benefit they
t0 , lh e country for the reason
o } 5n pe Â°P le were becoming supporters
and followers of the Jewish faith

had cone, to her sciences and her art.
les. said he. SpainÂ»had persecuted them
most vigorously and relentlessly. Oe
Castro, one of the foremost statesmen of
his time in Spam, predicted that with her
persecutions Spain would sink to the low
est rank of nations.
Rabbi Voorsanger addressed a large as.
pembly last evening at the Congregation
?iSf n ?" EI^ hte EU , b^ Ct beIn * relation"
ship of rnodcrn civilization to modern re
ligion. He showed the difference of the
conception of the relation of man to God
In antiquity and how it gradually evolved
to its present state. He also pointed out
TJiat the arts and sciences came from re.
ijrion.
The priest in olden times, said the rabbi
was the doctor, the lawyer, the one to
whom the people looked to for all advice
snd spiritual and material assistance.
The priest s functions changed with the
march of time and all the arts that he
practiced became the arts of many there
fore religion was the foundation of civil
izationâthe commencement of It
The world took what they have to-dav
from the man of God-from the priest â¢
As to. the supposed mystification of re
ligion he strenuously denied that such an
*lement as mystery existed around it
People of to-day could not be mystified
There was no mystery behind their ark'
nor behind their doors, which were wide
oppn that all might enter the house of
God. And there was no mystery in their
prayer.
When people said- that the world was
being destroyed they had no right /o as-
Fume that because of the skepticism of
to-dav there was to be a darkness. That
condition could never be, for they would
never be without God.
And. said the doctor, the same applied
to political fanaticismâ there was each a
thing as political zeal running riot. Men
became monomaniacs on a' subject' which
caused tnem to exclude all other matters
lor that one idea. In olden times the.
people looked upon their religion and the
fctate as one ana they grew to be rigorous
and cruel in their attempt to exclude for
eign influence. â¢
The Rev. Dr. Nieto delivered an elo
quent lecture to the members of Con
gregation Sherith Israel last evening in
which he demonstrated the evils of fanat
icism with which the human race has had
to contend for centuries. None, he said,
were more oppressed in the years that
have gone by than the Jew. He was a
victim of the fanatic There was nothing
more dangerous than fanaticism for it
brought ruin in its trail. -It was nothing
more nor less than zeal run riot.
Health Officer O'Brien stated that It
was necessary to provide, a suitable build
ing to accommodate patients. â¢. . , Â¦ â¢
The committee recommended .that the
board appropriate $5000 to build an addi
tion to the present hospital.
"Our protests, both orally and writ
ten." said Dr. Todd.' "have been directed
against establishing a smallpox hospital
in the Bay View district, and. the rest
dents are almost unanimously opposed to
the/ plan." . .
Chairman D' Ancona stated that it was
necessary to - provide suitable accommo
dations to house unfortunate patients. .
A letter was "read from Congressman
Kahn stating that the chances for the
passage of a bill establishing a leper col
ony in Hawaii, were exceedingly remote.
D'Ancona said he would never vote to
establish a smallpox hospital on the sec
ond site offered the city by the Bay View
Land Company, as . it was too far away
and the roadway required to be built
would cost $5600. Â¦â¢Â¦Â¦.- Â» â¢
The Supervisors' Health Committee met
yesterday to consider the petition of the
Board of Health that the Partridge tract
in the Bay View farm be purchased as
a site for a smallpox hospital. A num
ber of owners of property in the vicinity
of the proposed site addressed the com
mittee In opposition to the hospital. In
its petition the Health Board stated that
the objections "of the - property owners
only appertained t6 the Intention to build
a hospital ; for lepers ' on the site. - This
statement was contradicted by Dr. D. B.
Todd, who said -that objections were
made to any hospital. .

of St. Mark's parish have, agreed
to furnish the new Bishop - Kip
Memorial Chur.ch as a ". special
The Talbot country seat Is one of the
most extensive In the county and Is beau
tifully situated. It contains a handsome
residence and the proprietor employs a
dozen servants to keep it up.
Mr. and Mrs. Siem visited the District
Attorney's office after the husband's
wounds had been dressed, but went awav
without taking any action against tha
Before we were ready to start this mornln?
I> asked Mrs. Talbot if we could hare break
fast. Â¦ She refused and told mÂ« to leave the
house at once. While I was in my room my
husband came running in to say that Mrs Tal
bot had assaulted him with a gas lighter. We
struggled against Mrs. Talbot and her hus-.
band and the coachman as long as -we could
and then ran away. I was half-dressed and
had to borrow a dress from a neighbor so
that I could come to Oakland.
Mrs. Siem's story Is still a little differ
ent. She says all the blame rests with
the Talbots, who. she claims, set upon her
and her husband without provocation.
TVe were going to leave this morning- an<1
were getting our things ready when wÂ© heard
Talbot and his wife and the coachman com
ing â¢ up the stairs. Mrs. Talbot had a gas
lighter in her hands, the coachman had a
knife and I think Talbor had a club. Talbot
attacked me first and when my wife tried to
escape he went after her. She tore her clothes
trying to get away. Talbot and the coachman
then turned their attention to mo and kept
beating me until I Tan away. too.
Siem's Version of tha Battlel
According to Siem, Talbot's story la not
true, because, he says, his late employer
was the aggressor all the time. Says
Siem:
As soon as I entered the Siems' bedroom I
saw Mrs. Siems pulling my wife's hair, whila
Siem himself was helping to pummel her with
his fists. I jumped for him and he pulled th<Â»
gas lighter away from lira. Talbot and struck
me with it. He struck the coachman too.
"We wrestled out Into the hall and there suc
ceeded in giving him a good pummellng. Ha
ran away as soon as he got the chance and
with his wife went screaming down the road.
The Stems went to their rooms upstairs to
prepare to leave and my wife followed them
in a few moments, saying she would try to set
tle their account. She had a gas lighter in
her hand. She had been gone but a little
while when I heard her scream. I ran -up
stairs to see what was the matter, the coach
man. Dennis, following me.
"We came back from New Orleans yesterday
and went to our country place to see how
things were getting- ajong. We found things
In a turmoil. The Stems, whom we had lert
in charge, had disagreed with everybody on
the place and let things go to smash. \VÂ«
learned that they had been drinking ahd that
a wagon load of eggs and some other produce
of the farm had not been accounted for. I set'
tied the whole thing by discharging Siema,
and he was to have gone to-day.
MrÂ». Talbot went downstairs early this
morning to look after the breakfast. She re
turned in a little while to say that' Mrs.
Stems had been saucy to her. That made
me angry and I < demanded that Stems and
his wife leave forthwith.
Talbot Tells of the QuarreL
Different stories are being told by tha
different sides of the affair. The narratives
of the Talbots and the Siems are paral
lel as to certain incidents, but at a vital
point they diverge and become diaruet
rically opposed stories. They agree in t>>ij
â that the Siems, who have been overseeing
the work on the Talbot. farm for live
months during the absence of the proprie
tors, were discharged because their stew
ardship was unsatisfactory. They wcra
to have moved out -this morning, ar.d
thereby hangs a tale. Talbot's version cC
the affair Is as follows:
That the Talbots carried the day is evi
dent from the number and variety of
wounds inflicted upon the person of Henry
Siem, one of the hired hands. His wounds
were dressed at the Receiving Hospital,
after he had made a hurried retreat from
the scene of his undoing. There wa3 a
deep cut under the left eye and decolor
ations of the face. The sleeve of the left
arm bore a cut that evidently had been
made with a knife. Siem was accom
panied to the hospital by his wife, who
was the other victim of the melee, only
she escaped with a whole body. The cas
ualties of the Talbots are not reported.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway,, Jan. ZL
Frederick C. Talbot. member of the firm
of Pope & Talbot. shipping and lumber
merchants of San Francisco, capitalist
and gentleman farmer, assisted by his
wife and the coachman banished, two
hired hands from his country estate in
the outskirts of San Leandro this morning
before breakfast. The ejectment of the
unwelcome persons was accomplished
only after a sanguinary set-to betwsen
the opposing forces.
The estate over which this controversy
has occurred is that of the -widow of Eli
jah Farmer. Â¦ After a number of years
Mrs. Farmer married Dr. J.-W. Lowry.
She had acquired by the death of her
iirst husband considerable property. She
died about two years ago, being survived
by her husband, and several sons and
daughters of her -first' marriage. After a
diligent search no will was found and Dr.
Lowry applied for letters of administra
tion. Before the property had been dis
tributed, an alleged will, arrived by mail
at the County Clerk's office. It ' be
queathed to the husband the sum of $10,
the rest of the estate - going to the
children, and named Charles R. Farmer,
her.'' eldest son, as executor. Farmer
petitioned for the probate of the will and
a contest "between the children and the
husband followed. â¢
Bequeathed Estate to Children.
Dr. Lowry declared to-day that Schlot
terbach was innocent. of the charge and
that it was, an attempt: to discredit the
contestant of the will. He said he did not
believe his attorney had ever attempted
to bribe Churchill. Neither Schlotterbach
nor Churchhlll, would talk.
/, - . < .. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦Â¦ Â¦_Â¦
Schlotterbach, as attorney for Dr. Low
ry,,it was alleged by Churchill before the
Grand Jury, ottered the witness 51000 if he
would testily that he had drawn up the
will in question just for a joke and sup
posed that it would 'end there after the
public was tired of "joshing." It -was for
this that Schlotterbach was indicted. He
was arrested last ; night 'and was soon re
leased on giving a bond of $2000, with
Frank- P." Doyle and L. L. Vlers as his
sureties; . . . '
Churchill's reason for withholding the
will, as given in tne anonymous letter,
that accompanied the document, wasthat'
Dr. Lowry nad offered him money to sup
press the will, but after a time his con
science had triumphed and he sent the
codicil to the clerK's office.
Dr. Lowry Is Accused.
SANTA. ROSA, Jan.'. 31.-The mystery
connected "with the will of ~ the" late Re
bekah Lowry has been cleared. The au
thorship.otvthe will: and . the . unsigned
letter which accompanied it through the
mail to the County Clerk's office on; Aug
ust 24 has come to light. ' To add to tiie
interest in" the case P. L. Schlouerbach,
a prominent attorney, capitalist '<tnu man
ufacturer of .this city, is under arrest on
an indictment by the Grand Jury. He is
charged with having attempted to induce
a witness to give false testimony.
The witness referred id is narry H.
Churchill, bookkeeper for the Santa Â±tosa
Tanning Company, a corporacion m which
Schlotterbach is one ' of the heaviest
stockholders. Churchill, it is alleged, is
the author of the will and unsigned let

her to expert the books of tub Santa

Provisions
NEW YORK, Jan. 31. â The market to-day
reflected the discouragement of operators over
the pereUtent determination of the outside
public and the large money Interest to refrain
from speculation In stocks. The failure of
successive news development* to induce any
Interest in the speculation causes increasing
neglect, even on the part of professional oper
ators. There were some notable Individual
movements to-day, but the market as a whole
was trivia! and Inconsequential. The most
" >--onrpicoous movement was in Delaware,
lAckawanna. and Western. which rose by
rapid et&ges. making a new high recorf at
Â«ach etage, to 281%. It was expected that
the annual statement would be Issued to-day,
and the street forecast of earnings Is of a>
iate of from 16 to 20 per cent. The rate was
withhold from publication, but' the directors
were In cession. Rock Island mad* a notable
advance of S% points on light dealings, the
market supply of this stock being scarce. The
increase of Moore representatives in the direc
torate and the extension of common interests
in the company by some of the most influen
tial New York banks and trust companies were
cited as motives lor the advance. The price
of tie stock crossed that of St. Paul, but fell
back. American Unseed, after early weak
ness, rose 3% over last night and the preferred
four on account of the advance In the price
of I/nseed Oil. Southern Pacific led the mar
ket la point of activity, but Its narrow price
movement indicated active profit-taking, which
carried It below last sight's leveL
The speculation continued very active In
Amalgamated Copper, which rose 1%. lost it
ail and then rose 2% again at the close. The
arrival in this country of a director of the
Rio Tintos Company, supposed to be for the
purpose of forming a working agreement with
the Amalgamated Company, and the continued
rise In the price of copper wÂ«re the motives
of the speculation. Sugar continued depressed
because of fears that the duties on Cuban
sugars would be maintained and People's Gas
suSered a sharp break .without explanation.
There was an active demand late In the day
for Beadla*. but with only slight effect on the
price. Colorado Southern stocks were bought

CHICAGO, Jan. 31.â "O'lieat had a heavy
feeling all through, the session. Routine news,
while favoring buyers to some extent, ..was of
an Indifferent sort. Cables were slightly lower,
Argentina shipments were still much smaller
than a year bko and the receipts In the North
west were' light." The Southwestern markets
were bullish and on the breaks scalpers "bought
and ehorts covered. Trade, however, was lil.ht
in volume. This led speculators- to the argu
ment that business was too small to hold thÂ«
advance In the market when the uit turned
bearish. Professionals turned sellers, the sea
board reported a slack export demand and per
sistent selling caused" declines. The fluctua
tions were small, with a steady lower trend.

predicted rain advanced futures 2&C. andlgave
the spot market still more tone, though there
was no further advance. The market is broad
ening in all directions, there being a shipping
demand for . Europe, the Southwest and the
North. During the past three or four days
one lot of 1000 tons went from here to Port
land where the market is almost bare, owing
to the brisk demand in Oregon for Southwest

were lower. '
Chicago declined from TS'ic to 77*ic, but
subsequently regained some of the lost ground.
There was a small movement and a fair mill
ing demand in the Southwest and a free move
ment and v' oor milling demand In the North
west and at Chicago. The Northwest sold
heavily. The market in general was heavy
and a further decline was expected. Consider
able long wheat came out on stop orders at 7Sc.
Winter wheat was reported looking well, being
now amply .covered- with snow, but California
waa reported to need rain badly. The Bureau
of Statistics at Washington stated that three
nfths of the wheat exports from the United
States In December wert, from the Pacific
Coast, which ' shipped 5.080,000 bushels.
This market was quiet and not materially

the Northern demand and stocks here would
immediately accumulate. There la a very
good demand for the lower grades, as the re

Review of Trade to-morrow will say: Despite
some drawbacks the business situation . con
tinues satisfactory, with especially good news
from manufacturing centers;- Labor disputes
are somewhat more numerous ' and . low water
stopped mills- in parts \. of the.. Northwest.

Considerable Irregularity Is noted in prices
of cereals, hog products and cotton.' After the
late heavy decline in prices has, come several
reactionary: movements Jn wheat which tends
to discourage export demand.' Wheat strength
ened early in the week on Bradstreet's report
of a heavy Increase In the visible supply, but
weakened later on with improved winter wheat
crop receipts. Corn has displayed rather more
strength than wheat, while in oats the feature
was a spectacular break of 5o per bushel on
one day most of * which was, however,, re
gained. Hog prices have weakened - slightly
although receipts have been moderate, while
butter and country products . generally, have
strengthened on colder weather.; Sugar is 8-16c
higher. Coffee Is weak and lower.

Harrison's circular says: "During tha week
there have been three arrival* of coal from
"Washington. 6350 tons; one from Oregon, 44i>
tons; three from British Columbia, 11,360 tons:
one from Australia, 2767 tons; totai, 20.923
tons. Business in the fuel lino Is generally
quiet except for domestic requirements, which
has beea largely augmented by the cold crisp
â¢weather for the past several weeks. The de
liveries ot Wellington are very limited, hence
other- grades are finding ready sale for house
uses. Steam coals are betas offered freely at
low quotations, aa foreign freight rates en
coal are weak, to compete with which our
Northern products have been marked down
also. Besides, the number of factories using
fuel â¢ oil Ja increasing . monthly, I th<r , price ot
which yet remains- low, and will so continue
until tha 'refineries 'now In. course' of construc

large proportion of oil' now being utilised in
its crude â¢ state, for steam production.' Some
large oil properties have recently been disposed
of, the buyers being â¢> large -Â¦ fuel, consumer*.
They ".will thus become Insured against futurs

â¢- The lecturer then said that the stomach
was a member of "a union," and when
it was treated badly it went "on strike"
and called to its aid the. balance of the
human. organs affiliated with it.' In con
plusion Dr. Cheney described the weapons
used by the stomach when it declared war
and' told of. the symptoms of Indigestion
and' dyspepsia, which It called to its aid
He denounced the use of nostrums for
these ailments and said that If - mankind
would observe care in eating the stomach
would never rebel and demand better
treatment. ,
Dr. Cheney next described the various
manners in which the stomach was
abused and which caused that organ to
"go to war." "The stomach," said he,
!*never rebels without a reason. Over
work of the stomach, caused by over
eating, improper mastication of food and
drinking quantities of water with meals,
all' cause . the stomach to rebel. We dig
our graves with our teeth either by over
eating or byf hasty eating." . ' Â¦ " ':
Dr. Cheney first compared the human,
stomach' to a fuel reservoir and then aa
a savings . bank. He described the pro
cess of digestion and the manner in which
the blood is enriched by food. The stom
ach . was also compared, to a quartz mill
and a chemical : retort, and the lecturer
declared that the majority of * ailments
and diseases are due to an excess of food
and not to an excess of liauor. .
Dr. William 1 Fitch Cheney delivered an
interesting lecture last evening: in tta
auditorium of ' the Cooper Medical | Col
lege, Sacramento and Webster streets.- the
subject of his address being- '"The Stom
ach at Peace and- War." There- was a
large gathering "of ladies and gentlemen
present at the lecture, and as Dr. Cheney
avoided technical terms his discourse was
keenly enjoyed by his auditors.'

of -securing an extension of their franchise' on
reasonable terms. The present franchise has
yet twelve years to run. : The franchise on the

directors of the Presidio road. All but $180,
000 of the bonds have been redeemed.
' St. Louis is to' be a heavy consumer of as
phalt the coming year. It will be used. largely
on the exposition - buildings, the erection of
which will soon be commenced. As the Cali
fornia asphalt is far superior to the Eastern
product it is every bit as cheap, in spite of .the
additional 'cost of transportation.- - First grade
product is sold on board in this city at from
$10 to $14. a ton, and as It can be delivered
in St.. Louis at from $20 to $24 a ton, much of
the home product' will very probably find its
way there. St. N Louis will, use' thousands of
tons of asphalt the coming year, and It is pre
dicted will consume in .that period more than
the whole State of. California. ' ....
It. is evident even to an .outsider, that the
asphalt' market . is expanding * at- a 'lively rate,
and that California asphaltum is'now very pop
ular with Eastern -manufacturers. This week
representatives of I St. Â¦ Louis roofing firms were
in the city with a view 'of closing contracts for
a large amount of refined asphalt. These gen
tlemen are now going over the Kern River, field,
and it is , understood will' close for, some large
shipments before leaving the State.
From one small oil refining plant in the. Los
Angeles field, there hap been shipped already
.this month fourteen carloads' -(210 tohs) ; ~6f .re
fined, asphal turn. . The output is the- product
of the Franklin refinery's stills, which are now
treating in the neighborhood of 8000 barrels of
local oil a month. The shipment is the reoord
for the plant, and although the' output* marks
the limit of .. its capacity the demand for Â¦ re
fined asphalt was. not satisfied, and there are
now many orders to-be 'filled. .-â¢_ :..Â»â¢â¢-.;
The Los Angeles Herald has . the fol
lowing concerning the opening up in the
Eastern market jor California asphalt: ~
Arizona is/to be prospected for oil . by
Los Angeies parties, who , will, start by
drilling a well near the Old Camel Back
Mountains, northeast, from .Phoenix. A
Phoenix company will also operate in the
same section. Â¦ Â¦- i ' '-

. -The California Petroleum Miners' Association
does not charge one cent for information,' for It
believes that thennore conservative and proper
facts it can put before the public the better It
will be for all concerned. We have no fault
to find with any private corporation or agency.
They are a?erfectly Â¦ legitimate in their place,
and. if -conducted honestly, they have Â¦ a place.
But if they exist for the sole purpose of selling
Stock" in' certain companies, the sooner they,

formance of a well owned by. the Brea
Canyon. Oil Company- at. Fullerton, which
flowed 1015 barrels in twenty-four hours,
or more than forty-two barrels per. hour.
At last account it was still making , a

oil, water -having broken. .In to -. take â¢ the
place of oil, is now flowing both oil and
water.-
Great Flowing "Well.
The Supervisors of San Joaquin County
have inspected the oiled roads of Kern
County and are about to^ consider th<j
placing of contracts for; oiling about 100
miles of roadway, j The quantity, that will
be - required to keep up that mileage is
estimated to be about 35,000 barrels per
annum. The roads of the State. will call
for a great amount of oil eventually, the
improvement to the roadbed having been
marked in all counties where, the experi
ment has been tried/ .- v Â¦
The country between the Sunset district
and San Emidio is about to be tested for
oil by- the Grand Oil Company. The prop
erty is fourteen Â¦ miles east from Sunset,
near the foothills. There are oil seepages
beyond the spot picked out for the site
of the first well. .â¢--.â¢ _ .
The car shortage in the Kern River dis
trict has been broken. One . day. during
the last -week there were standing, on the
tracks in the V Santa Fe -yards at least
twenty-five cars , In excess of orders and
there are now sufficient cars to meet the
demands of the producers for.transporta
tion for their wares. Shipments are." ex
pected to be 'much larger in the immedi- :
ate future than those of the .past, .when
the facilities were;poor. Â¦ .; .Â¦Â¦

That the action of the Justices in ap

posited with the City Treasurer . by Win

way to political pressure and that having
declared war against the City Hall
"push" he was resolved to fight to the
Grand Jurors Farnsworth and Roach
visited the chambers of the various Jus
tices yesterday and looked over their cal
endars. What the real purpose of the
visits was can only be surmised. It will
be remembered that In his statement pub
lished yesterday Mayor Schmitz charged
that it was almost impossible to find a
Justice in his office during the afternoon
of anv day. The inquiries addressed to
the Justices indicated that this statement
had had an effect upon the Grand Jury
and that a quiet investigation of the facts
is now in, progress.
The Justices, without exception, char
acterize the Mayor's statement as being
uncalled for and unjust. The nature of
Presiding Justice Daniels' duties renders
it Imperative that he should be in nla
office until 5 o'clock every day, and that
official says he has never neglected his
duties. Justice Long asserts that he is
not only on duty every afternoon, but
that once or twice a week he holds night
sessions of court for the accommodation
of working people who are witnossesin
civil, actions. The other Justices defend
themselves with similar pleas and all in
vite the fullest investigation of their of
ficial acts. .^ â¢
No action will be taken on the applica
tion for guardianship papers until the
court has had an opportunity of visiting
the unfortunate. woman at the hospital.
The testimony given by F. D. Marsh of
the firm cf Burnham & Marsh, real estate
brokers, showed that Mrs. Daniels was
very much in need of a guardian.' and
also showed that dealing in real estate is
not always conducive to large bank ac
counts. Marsh testified that through his
solicitation Mrs. Daniels purchased a
piece of property on Taylor street for
J15.000, which she sold two weeks later
for $13,000. Whether or not Mrs. Daniels
knew that she had suffered a loss to the
deal Is not known. It is presumed thai
she did not. for she immediately commis
sioned the same brokers to purchase a lot
at the corner of Devisadero and Page
streets for $8009. This property remained
in her possession for a short time, when
Marsh, according to his -own statement,
persuaded her to exchange it for property
In the same neighborhood In not quite so
good a location, but which was good
enough to require a bonus of $6500. Â£he
afterward ordered the purchase of other
properties. The result of these real cs
late deals is a reduction of her fortune to
a sum approximating S3CO0. . \ â¢
Several witnesses ! testified yesterday
that Mrs. Daniels is not in the full pos
session of her senses and that she is in
capable of attending to any matter of
business. ...
Though she has been bedridden since
October, 1901, Mrs. Mary E. Daniels has
lost a fortune of $20,000. Just how she did
it is now a matter for the courts to /6s
termine, and an inquiry was commenced
yesterday in Judge Troutt's court, when
the application of Mrs. Margaret Halpin
of Ban Luis Obispo for letters of guar
dianship over the person and estate of
Mrs. Daniels came up for hearing. Sensa
tional developments are expected, as it
was stated yesterday that Mrs. Danieis
is confined at the L.a,n-e Hospital and that
no one Is allowed tÂ» see her.
The crime was discovered shortly after
7 o'clock by two patrolmen. The officers
forced a Chinese who sleeps -Inside the
place to open the door. This Mongolian
made a statement that the theft had been
committed but a few moments- before, yet
he had been too frightened to raise an
alÂ£.rm. The police, upon investigation,
discovered that silks valued at nearly $500
had been draged from the shelves and
carted away. The Central police station
was immediately notified and Detectives
McMahon and Gibson placed on the case.
Until a* late hour last night they had been
unsuccessful in their effort to locate the
offenders. Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ Â¦
The crooks sawed a section from one of
the Iron doors guarding the front en
trance to the store, inserted a hook* and
extracted nearly $500 worth of silks and
goods, with which they made their es
cape and are still at liberty. The dark
ened Interior of the store caused the bur
glars some difficulty. To overcome tbis
they secured a bunch of burning. Chine3e
punks that emitted no flame, but a glow,
and with this uncertain light the thieves
were enabled to pick their booty and drag
it out.
Burglars used a unique means of y r6b
bing Cbong Lee's store, at 828 Dupont
street, yesterday morning. They operated
from the street just as day was breaking,
and while hundreds of laborers passed
from North Beach to their occupations
in the commercial section.
