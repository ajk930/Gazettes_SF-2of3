Already, according to the people of

Newcastle to Loomis, a distance of about
nine miles. The' surveyors are as non
committal as their official chief In this
city, and whether the line they have indi
cated will be the final one they are not in
a position or at liberty to declare.
The people of the entire . county of
Placer from Auburn up to the boundary
line of Nevada County have recently been
greatly stirred by the appearance in .the
foothill region of a party of surveyors,
who have been driven down from the high
Sierra by the winter weather and^who
are utilizing their time in running lines
over the foothills.

When asked to mention the

authorized to particularize at this time.
This reticence will be the source of great
anxiety when the confirmation of fear3
strongly entertained by the people of

head of the construction department of

NEW YORK. Feb. 3.â The gale which
has been sweepirg the coasts of Long Isl
and and New Jersey for more than twen
ty-four hours and is continuing to-night,
though with abating force, has brought
death and disaster to sa'.lors and their
craft. Reports of loss of life are confined
to the eastern end of Long Island,
whence comes news that several bcdles
have been washed ashore. It was not
known up to 10 o'clock to-night what ves

to-day, were in peril all day. Late re
ports to-night say they are still on the
stranded vessel, though the danger . of
ccath has been lessened owing to th?
slight abatement of the storm. A westerly
pale was blowing at the rate of seventy
miles an hour when the Schepp struck, at
S:30 o'clock in the morning. The men
from Captain Andrew Rhoades' life-sav
ing station, a mile to the cast, dragged
their mortar to the scene of the wreck,
reaching the Schepp about daybreak, and
found the seas breaking over her bow
and stern. She was about 1000 feet from
chore and tossing heavily with every
thrust of the powerful breakers. Nearly
every spar on her was twisted or broken
Several of the crew could be seen on deck
running to and fro in apparent efforts to
keep from freezing to death. The life
tavers of Captain Rhoades' station and
those of the Long Beach station, under
Captain Van Wycklen, made several at
tempts to shoot the lifelines over the
fchepp, but the afternoon' s efforts were
not successful. They then tried to launch
the lifeboat, but this, too, proved impos
sible.

President Roosevelt devoted nearly the

of Rear Admiral Schley. He had a con

Rear Admiral Evans, who commanded
the Iowa at the battle of Santiago; Rear
Admiral Taylor, who commanded the In

Walnwright, who commanded the Glou

took them to luncheon with him, where
the discussion was continued, and they
remained with him for an hour or so after
leaving the table. The President is de
sirous of taking action on this case and
having It known as speedily as possible.
He desired to talk with the commanders
of various ships -that participated in the
battle with Rear Admiral Schley, and
clear up in his own mind any doubts that
have lodged there because of the conflict

stated that when the President does reach

port-to the Secretary. This report will
state the sites selected for camps, one In
the East, one in the South, one in the
West and one on the Pacific Coast.
The President expressed in his annual
message a belief that troops . could be
placed in camp, marched from one point
to another, there embarked on transports
and taken to some other point, disem
barked and marched to another camp. As
the general board had before It the selec
tion of sites for four great military campj
of instruction, it is said Miles, who is
president of the board, probably went to
the White House to discuss that subject
with the President.
One army officer said the President be

plans for mimic warfare between the
army and navy forces. Miles had gone to
him to suggest that the general board

It was rumored thlÂ» afternoon that Miles
had requested the President to retire him
under the provision permitting: an officer
to retire on bis own application after thir
ty years' service. This, however, "is au
thoritatively denied, and the only Indica
tion it related 'in any way to the visit
some weeks. ago, at the time Miles was
reprimanded, is that to-day's talk was
partly personal, and did not refer entire
ly, to official matters before the War De

Several days ago Miles requested the
President to make an appointment to see

day, when the President received Miles in

Foraker of Ohio believed it might re
quire impeachment proceedings to remove
Judge Noyes, but Teller .contended that
the President had ample power to remove
a territorial Judge. He believed there was
no question about it. He declared the
actions of Judge Noyes had been a "cry
ing shame," and asserted that "a "recital
of his outrages would startle the Ameri
can people.'.'
Tillman read the article, which indicated
that Judge Noyes and his associates are
drawing large salaries ' from the United
States while the case against' them is
pending in the courts. One of the men,
according to the article, who is serving
his sentence, continues to draw his* salary.
Tillman made running comments upon
the statements In the article, directing all
his sarcasm, ridicule and invective against
Judge Noyes, finally inquiring:
"By the way, whose business Is it to re
move this man?"
Taking advantage of the latitude of de
bate offered by the Senate rules, Tillman
directed attention to an article in the
Washington Post, published to-day, rela
tive to the case of Judge Arthur H. Noyes
of the District Court of Alaska, who was
fined $1000 recently by the Circuit Court at
San Francisco, and of associates of Judge
Noyes, who were involved with him.

KANSAS CITY, 1 Mo., Feb. 3.â General
Frederick Funston to-day was subjected
to the; surgeon's knife. The operation' was
performed at Scarrltls' Hospital under the
direction of Dr. E. Fr Robinson of this
city, with whom t)ie general has been In
correspondence since his . landing at San
Francisco from Manila a month ago.
After General Funston arrived here from
the West last week and had sought^a con
sultation with Dr. Robinson, it was stat
ed that another operation would not be
necessary. Â»Within a day or. so, however,
the wound of the original operation for
appendicitis had not healed as the phy
sicians believed it should and the second
operation was decided upon. Before the
operation was performed to-day Dr. Rob
inson stated that It would prove a minor
affair. Later he stated that the general
had undergone the ordeal in a satisfac
tory manner and that he believed the
outcome would be what had been de
sired. It would "be necessary, however,
fdr the patient to remain at the hospital
for probably two weeks.
- "I anticipate no serious complications,"
said Dr. Robinson, "and believe that Gen
eral Funston will be fully recovered with
in two weeks. The. operation involved the
reopening of the old wound, its " free
drainage and partially closing it." '
The operation was made necessary 'by
the presence of an abscess, the result of
the operation for appenditicis performed
at Manila, September 25,: 1901.
It was a good mile and a >half to their
home and as the '.women saw tlje lion
start after the buggy the'y let the horses
run. The lion followed until the barking
of the house dog frightened it away. ;
Mrs. Le Forgee had some fresh meat in
the buggy which she had purchased in
town, and this is probably what caused
the beast to become so daring. During
the last few days a heavy snowfall on
the Coast Range has caused lions and
coyotes to quit their mountain fastnesses
for the more agreeable temperature on
the lower slopes.
GERMANTOWN, Feb. 3.â Mrs. F. M.
Le Forgee and Mrs. A. Houseworth were
pursued by a mountain lion as they were
returning to their homes in the western
part of Glenn County on' Friday. They
had been to Germantown to \ do some
trading and on their return, just as they
entered the low foothills, . something
frightened their team. Both women
turned at the same Instant and saw
emerging from a gulch not many rod3
distant a huge California Hon. The
horses saw the animal at the \ same time
and it was with extreme difficulty that
the team, as it dashed away at the top
of its speed, could be managed at all or
kept in the road, which at that point Is
very rugged. , : -. Â¦

To prevent the demolition of the coffins
and tfie mutilation of the bodies of Ed
ward and John Biddle, which in all prob
ability would follow their burial if the
epot were generally known, Harry Biddle
,has arranged a secret plan to dispose of
his brothers' remains without letting the
public know when cr where the interment
will take place.
Detective McGovern Raid. "Kill all the
raecals" and pointed his gun at me. Detective
tSwinehart called to him to have mercy on me;
that I was only a woman and not to shoot me.
The horse turned into the field and made a
.ircle into the road again. That was all I
lemeir.ter. Detective Swinehart ran to me and,
trailing to me. he asked it I was hurt and I said
1 was ehot. He raised me up and held my head
on his knees. Then I felt myself fainting and
th< next thing I knew I was in the sleigh.
We were forced to leave the jail before our
arrangements were complete. I learned on
Wednesday that the bars on the doors on the
oÂ«"lls on that range were to be inspected on
Thursday. I knew the sawed bars on Ed and
Jack's cell would be found. I gained admit
tance to the Jail and conveyed this information
to the boys. We then agreed to go that night.
I d:d not intend to go with them. They were
â¢ to make their flight alone. I intended to go to
chc country for a few days and then meet them.
Detective Saves Her Life.
1 hen we soon reached Mount Chestnut, and
rtting something to cat. started out again,
was feeling ill and was frightened. Th.
dovs learned that the detectives were after us
and they consulted about defending themselves.
Ed raid to Jack. "It is a life for a life; lets
ehoot them down." The boys drove on. They
were bewildered about the whereabouts of the
detectives. They thought the Pittsburg de
tectives were behind them. When they taw
them appear Ed told Jack to get ready. He
â¢recognized Detective Koach. Detective McGov
ern got out of the sleigh and was followed by
the other two. I saw McGovern fire. ThÂ«s
ehots were returned by Ed and Jack. Then
there v.as a fusillade of bullets. I saw Ed
and Jack fall out of the sleigh. I was -shot.
The hcrse tooic fright and ran away.
Ed asked me to come with them. "Come
v.ith us," he said to me. I resisted and tolJ
them to go. Xhey told sse they had not au
instant to lese And if the officers got away i
would be discovered. I tried to persuade theii
to go. Then I felt myself giving way to Ej s
jj*!>uat=iGiis and yielded. We all dasned out o.i
K.O&& street. We then passed alone the court
alley. Ed and Jack went along Urant street
and crossing the river we met in Allegheny at
their friend's house. Well, we could not re
main there and we were soon out on the road
again. We secured a sleigh and drove through
the country all nigrht. The night was bltttr
cold. There was no r. be in the sleigh and I
Buffered terribly. When daylight came I was
nearly perished by the cold. The next day
brought us to the ' terrible scene. We drove
through Butler and knew that we had be;n
fcuspected.
"I had not intended- going with the Bid
dle boys on the night of their escape, but
â¢ t-d's entreaties won, me over." She told
of how she remained in the library on
Thursday awaiting the signal for the out
breaK. It was her intention to let- the
boys go and she would meet them later.
While sitting in the library, she said, she
was almost paralyzed when the two
brothers came crashing through the door.
In i.heir excitement they had lost the key
to this door and had- to break it down.
Continuing her story, she said:
F1TTSBURG, Feb. 3.â The remains of
Edward and John Biddle. the dead ban
dits, arrived at the Pittsburg railroad sta
tion at 11 o'clock this morning. A thou
sand or more people had gathered at the
station. When the train drew in there was
a rough scramble to get to the platform
of the depot, during which several were
bruised by being crushed against the
stairway. The morgue wagon was wait-
Ing and the bodies were quickly 'driven to
the morgue for identification. An im
mense crowd soon gathered, but a large
detail cf police'prevented them from en
tering the building. The remains of the
murderers were turned over to their
brotner, Harry Biddle, who will give them
proper interment in the Southslde Ceme
tery.
The only matter now of anything like
absorbing interest in connection with the
Biddies is the fate of Mrs. Soffel and any
thing she may say concerning the escape
and subsequent capture of th6 trio. .Mrs.
fcoffel is lying in tne Butler Hospital and
will recover. She made a statement to
night to some newspaper men In .the pres
ence of Dr. Bricker, in which she said:
Won by Ed's Entreaties.
There is strong suspicion that the fire
which destroyed the Scovfl House was
the work of an Incendiary. The fire orig
inated in the pool and billiard room -in
the basement of- the house on the further
side from the burning district. The room
was locked and no one was supposed to
be there, nor. was any fire kept in the
room. The fire came so close on the
heels of the big conflagration that the
thousands of spectators who witnessed it
were thrown into a more complete panic
than the original fire caused. The flames
had. only begun to die out along Grand,
Bank and South Main streets at 4 o'clock
when flames leaped upward as if by
magic and people feared the city was
doomed after all. The engines that hur
ried to the scene turned their attention
mainly to preventing the spread of the
flames. It was evident that the hotel
was doomed, and if the fire had reached
the adjoining buildings there would nave
been very little hope of saving the . cen
ter of the city. The fire burned far into
the day and was not extinguished eiv
urely until evening.
A revised list of losses and insurance
is very difficult to obtain at this time; It
Is believed that when the truth is known
the loss will; amount to more than
Â£.',000,000. There was no loss of life.
> The city's telephonic communication,
lighting facilities and electric powers
were restored . before nightfall.
A tangled network of wires on Bank
and South Main streets. greatly hindered
the work of extinguishing the last flames
and clearing away the wreckage. How
ever, the streets are rapidly being cleared
and the trolley service will soon be re
sumed.
There was more or less disorder, but
the police have been very active, and the
militia has been of great service In hand
ling the crowds. The streets were piled
with household goods and strewn with
small articles thrown from the windows.
Some of this property was confiscated by
passers-by, but the amount of thieving
was small compared with "the opportuni
ties offered by the confusion.
WATERBURT, Conn., Feb. 3.â The sun
rose this morning on a blackened 'Â¦ and
smoldering mass of. ruins that, marked
the main business section of' the city.
The scene about the city to-day was only
a little less remarkable than that of the
rrevlous" evening.. Thousands of people
stumbled around the icy streets, and
with the greatest difficulty were re
strained by the militia and police from
venturing within the danger lines.

The ruse had the desired , effect. The
robbers did not advance, but proceeded
to camp in proximity to Wolf. Wolf had
staying qualities himself and from 9
o'clock until daylight this morning he
stood over his money, holding the rob

peared.
Wolf had been employed in Keswick

the town. At 9 o'clock, just above Kes
wick, two men emerged from the bushes
and ordered him to hand over his money.
Wolf was unarmed. He had a meer
schaum pipe in a case and with rare pres
ence of mind he quickly decided to bluff
the would-be robbers. He quickly drop
ped his money bag to the ground and
scraped dirt and leaves over it with his
foot. Then, drawing his pipecase from
his pocket and aiming it, he ordered his
assailants to stand back. He snapped
the pipecase several times, like the cock

John Hackett of the Pacific Coast
Dredging Company Is the owner of the
burned tug. It-has been mostly employed
in doing work about the Oakland estuary.
The origin of the fire is a mystery. At
the close of the day's work the crew left
the boat and the fires were banked and
closed up. No one was aboard during
the night, but it is thought some waste
soaked with oil was thrown into a corner
and spontaneous combustion ensued. The
damage to the vessel is estimated at
about $8000.
The tugboat "Walter Hackett, while ly
ing at the foot of "Webster street, was
burned to the water's edge shortly after
midnight. The flames had gained con
siderable headway when discovered and
it was necessary to pump the boat full
of water before the fire was. extinguished.

Frightened out of his senses the clerk
gave a cry of terror and fled. He was
speechless when he reached the hotel of
fice and it was several minutes before he
was able to tell what he had seen. The
physicians visited the room a few min
utes later and found Mrs. Moore dead.
Shortly after 9 o'clock Heffernan opened
the door of Â«Mrs. Moore's room. As he
did so she ar,ose In bed. opened her eye3
gasped and moaned, "Oh, my God." Her
face took on a look of awful fear and
despair. For several seconds she sat thus
and then fell back with the death rattle
In her throat. Â¦
On the following morning the guest was
found unconscious from the effects of the
poison . she had taken. After the phy
sicians had done all they could for her
they departed, giving Hotel Clerk Charles
Heffernan instructions to look into Mrs
Moore's room occasionally. The phy
sicians realized that she would die and
that they could do nothing further for her.
On Friday evening Heffernan made sev
eral visits to the room, no one else caring
to look in upon the dying woman.
This greatly surprised the clerk, as she
had previously been ordering the best.
She went up town on Thursday afternoon
and returned with several packages. It
is supposed that she purchased drugs.
Returning to the hotel she ordered din
ner. The lady did not seem in the least
excited or depressed; in fact the hotel
attaches remarked at the time on her evi
dent breeding and self-possession. She
chatted with Miss Clara Wagner, asking
her about the city. One question was
noteworthyâ the stranger asked what kind
of a morgue there -was here and if the
public was allowed to view the bodies.
Some of the incidents of the strange
woman's last hours came to light to-day.
"When Mrs. Moore, , as she was called,
arrived at the hotel she ordered the best
luncheon to be had in the house. After
luncheon she asked for a room. The clerk
showed her a suite.
"No," she said, "I want the cheapest
room you have."

The discovery of the plot had one good

for some time. It was intended to re

at length made from there stops were to
have been made in Chenting and Paoting.
In the confession it was stated j that a
numerous body of men had. been, especial
ly detailed to destroy the . Chentlng-Pe
klng railway, while other bands of armed
men had been ordered to fire at the im
perial train from various vantage points.
Search was made, in a house where two
of the conspirators -were arrested, and
there were found a number of detailed re
ports on the strength of the garrisons of
almost every walled city of the Chinese
Empire, their capability of resistance, the
character of the men and their officers,
and other papers relating to the defense
of the cities of thÂ« empireâ in f act\ in
formation suchas-would be gathered by
an army preparing to go to war. ;A dozen
or more volumes were, found containing
the names of 'the Honan members of the
two secret societies, KolafgUul and Tatoa
Hui, interested in the proposed rebellion
against -the Manchu dynasty. ; Â¦
Viceroy Yuan Shih-Kai at once' took
steps to. safeguard the imperial party and
it made the journey safely to Peking.
Viceroy -Yuan Shih-Kai had the railway
guarded .from Chenting to Peking, with
encampments of. all his available troops
on both -sides of the line â¢ throughout its
entire extent. At the same -.'time -he 1
ordered '-mounted'" troops : to .search the
country for j fifteen" ll**on* either' side < of
the railway, with orders to scatter any
body of men exceeding two or three in
number and arrest any suspicious char
acters in sight at the time of the passing
of the train. Â¦
The North China Daily News says that
after the failure of the attempt to burn
the Kaifeng palaces a number of the in
cendlaries were captured by i the Honan*
authorities. They were tortured, with a
view of ; extorting confessions. .; The un
fortunate captives were., placed ..in : large

only temporary, as Sigourney followed
with a. run of 38 caroms and from, that
point to the end held the -lead:..' Summary:
The contest was played in the
of the Knickerbocker Athletic Club. Eight
players are entered in the tournament.
They are Charles Threshie, Boston;. John

Schmidt, Boston; Charles S. Morris. New

Schmidt won the bank and selected the
black ball. He counted on the regulation
opening shot and then fell down badly on
a kiss from the cushion. SigOurnÂ»y's first
shot was an effective drive of the red
ball around the table, the trio of spheres
nestling together in the lower right-hand
corner In a way which promised a big
run; but the Calif ornian only made three,
missing on a short single cushion shot.
In â¢ the third inning Sigourney clicked oft
17 by close and delicate work. Then for
a time he appeared unable to coax the
ivories to roll favorably for him. A- cluster,
of 34- on his fourteenth 7 turn followed by
15 and later backed by 28 placed him well
within the second hundred points. For this
section of the contest , his ' average was
6 8-19, for 122 points..

"IN THE PALACE OF THE KING" ADDS
ITSELF TO THE LIST OF SUCCESSES
Production ProvesWorthy the Name-â "The Pride of Jennico" Pleases Au
dience at the California, "The Danites" Holds the Boards at the
Alcazar and Entertaining Plays Are Billed at All the Local Theaters
SCENE FROM F. MARION CRAWFORD'S CLEVER DRAMA NOW BE
ING PRODUCED AT THE COLUMBIA, AND A TALENTED ACTRESS
WHO IS APPEARING AT THE CALIFORNIA. ' . â¢
Is one of the cleverest performances that
has been seen at the theaters here in some
time. The cast is made up of- old Tivoli
favorites, and there is not one of the per
formers that is not up to the mark set by
the admirers of comic opera who fre
quent the house. Ferris Hartman's Ameer
is very funny, and his efforts are ably
seconded by Edward Webb, who appears
occasionally as Crackasmile, the court
Jester. '< . Â¦ -
- Harry Cashman as Heezaburd; lord high
chamberlain to the Ameer, plays his part
cleverly and gets as much humor out of
his lines as 1Â» possible. Little but praise
can be given to Harold Gordan, the Tlvo
li's new tenor. He has a clear, sweet voice
and a good Btage presence. John Cun
ningham as Blakjak is a favorite, partic
ularly' when his part gives him a chance
to exercise his splendid barytone voice.
Frances Graham, Annie Myers and An
na Lichter still hold the Tivoli audience as
in past seasons, and the work of the chor
us, -particularly in the second act, is
worthy of praise. .
IN the Palace of the King," produced
last night at the Columbia Theater,
added itself immediately to the list
of the large successes of recent the
atrical years. It is a production
worthy of the name on which has been
expended the best effort of the stage
manager, > scene painter, costumer and
all the honorable, tribe that must lend
their wits to make the play the tiling^
after him. whd has penned it and those
who act it have been given their larger
share. The settings and costumesâ to
speak disrespectfully of the frame before
the pictureâ are of the truly sumptuous
order, Â¦rich, splendid and in admirable
taste, and with all the evidence of a
careful historical correctness in tho tie
tail. They are "by" Ernest Albert and
Mr. and Mrs. Edward Seidle of the
Metropolitan Opera-house, who for the
fine art of the achievement deserve to
be remembered with those better known
folk who have made the more familiar
success of the piece.
"In the Palace of the King," one is in
formed, is a dramatization by Lorimer
Stoddard of F. Marion Crawford's novel
of the name, J#A possessing the unique
distinction of having been planned before
the story was written and played before
the book was published.. Mr. Stoddard
has made quite free with the- incident of
the story, changing It importantly even to
shifting the characters in places and in
troducing others. The main incident of
the story, Don John's love for the beau
tiful Donna Dolores de Mendoza, with the
wholesale opposition it meets with, re
mains unchanged, and being brought into
stronger relief its importance is even en
hanced. The playwright has done his
work very effectively in keeping the his
torical note clear and as a picture of the
day of King Philip II of Spain it is both
accurate and highly picturesque. The
play drops Into melodrama quite frequent
ly, measuring a thrill a minute In the
fourth act In true Morosco style. But it
is generally plausible, the probabilities
are not subjected to too heavy strain, and
It is clear in plot and not overcrowded
save in the same fourth act.
As the fair Dolores de Alendoza. Viola
Allen has as good opportunity for the ex
ercise of her peculiar gifts as she has ever
had. The charm of freshness, vivacity.
Spontaneity was always here, and
she has. added a yet fuller power to her
art. There is a delightful quality of un
expectedness about her work, a quaint
turn or twist that turns pathos into mirth
with a merry magic that is irresistible.
She has a delicious vein of humor, and
her love-making scenes with Don John
are as pretty as they make them. Neither
does Miss Allen lack emotional power,
and if there Js a note that seems a little
off-key In her work sometimes it is a too
robust quality in the scenes where trag
edy looks in. Her scene where she defies
her father to separate her from her lover
by any means this side of^cold poison, re
minding him that she is his daughter and
has a will of her own, is as powerful as
any in the play, with its glimpse of ten
derness where the proud hidalgo reveals
his hidden 1 love for his daughter. But
there is climax after climaxâ more than
might wisely beâ wherein Miss Allen
shines .with different light, placing her
self among those that count In all of
these. - : - â¢ - :
Miss Allen's supporting - company ' is
almost of the best. Don John is played
by William Pascoe, and is a manly and
pleasant conception without being par
ticularly strong. W. E. Bonney, who is
the King Philip, is one of the best play
ers in the company. He presents ah ad
mirably realistic portrait of the "plotting
monarch, full of power and dignity. It
is a case of complete .identity:- with r the
character, and adds tremendously to the
atmosphere of the play> J An '.-excellent
sketch of the court jester .is done by
Arthur T. Hoyt, whose work isa.gem in
grotesque. Walter Hitchcock is a most
unchurchly cardinal, and J. H. Benrimo
lacks magnificence as Dolores' stern
parent. -,â¢ Â¦/. Â¦ <, Â¦- ,
The women of the company are only
Important In two instances-fMisSAdelaide
Prince as the highborn' adventuress, Prin
cess Eboli. and Adelaide Warren as Don
na. Inez, the sister of. Dolores. Both are
adequate. Miss Prlncft shows consider
able cleverness as the scheming Princess,
and without disdaining jto sound the
melodramatic accent that the part large
ly demands. Miss 'Warren; also, is suffi
cient unto her part, making a touching
and effective picture of the blind girl. The
remainder of the cast is acceptably filled,
S nd , I' 1 ", the Pala ce of the King" is
booked for success. A large house,
gowned in its best, greeted the play last
night, and testified by ample applause its
pleasure in the production.
Grand Opera-House.
The opening night of "Jim the Penman"
at the Grand Opera-house was . very suc
cessful. The audience was unusually large
and enthusiastic, and the excellent play
was pleasingly rendered.
Jim the Penman is the. police name for
a forger whose crimes have extended over
two continents. He has won ' a fortune
for himself and accomplices by "his clever
work- and stolen the affections and hand
of the fiancee of one of his boyhood
friends. A brilliant detective, who is the
leading character of the play, finally dis
covers his -rascality. His. wife' also learns
of the trick i by which she was . won
through a comparison of letters. The
forger sets things as nearly right as pos
sible, and is prepared to take the conse
quences of his misdeeds when he dies of
heart failure. , ; ... , - â .
The play Is replete with thrilling situa
tions and applause is frequent. -Edwin
Arden as the detective leaves little to be
desired. His work is admirable and shows
that his reputation is Justly won.- Her
schel Mayall as the forger and Laura Nel-
Bon Hall as his wife appear to good ad
vantage. Lillian Albertson has a. difficult
part, which she renders very creditably.
Gardner Crane asthe chief victim of the
forger's wiles is also much in, popular fa
vor. The rest of the cast furnishes excel
lent support for the leaders.
Orpheum.
Kelly and Violette display some stun
ning costumes in their act this week at
the Orpheum, and they are gaining in
pdpularity at every appearance. They
are sweet singers and the vaudeville yell
has n6t. afflicted them. They are as good
in coon songs as in the non-syncopated
ballad and well earn the recalls that are
forced upon them.
Josephine Sabel has a way of her own
that takes the house. She is full oiMlte
The women of the Da Coma family are
as clever as the men and do several
"stunts" that, are hair raisers. Adelina
Roattino warbles like a real cantatrice
and sings "Coming Through the Rye" in
a very fetching way.
The great cycle whirl, the Paust trio,
the trained dogs, Jordan and Crouch and
the American biograph are up to the
usual standard. The scene of the Jubilee
bridge across the St- Lawrence at Mon
treal,, shown on the biograph, is especial
ly interesting.
Alcazar.
: Joaciuln Miller's powerful play, "The
Danltes," was revived at the Alcazar
-Theater last - night. The success < it
achieved with McKee Rankin and , his
clever wife In the leading roles has never
.left it and its representation of life In
.the mining camps in the â¢ Sierras during
:the days of '49 will always appeal strongly
;to the people -of the golden West. â¢
' Â¦ The "production of the stock- company
last night was most creditable In every
respect. The parts were evenly balanced
and. the result was apparent in the curtain
calls after the close of each act. M. L.
Alsop as Sandy McGee, a. typical miner of
the- early days; 1 looked the part tc-perfec
tion and gave a forceful and Intelligent
portrayal. ..George Osbourne as 'Charles
Godfrey, the parson, â¢ achieved a marked
success. â¢.-: . â¢ -Â¦ â¢â¢'â¢;',
Frank Bacon gave a lifelike representa
tion of the Judge who -"flourished inthls
glorious climate of California," and Henry
Shumer, Carlyle Moore, Howard Scott, 1
Paul Gerson, Royal Dana Tracy and Jack
Morris were good In their respective parts.
Marlon Convere was very .-- effective as
Nancy Williams,; who posed', as y, "Billy
Piper," the boy miner, and aroused the
sympathies of the audience. _ . :
Â¦Margaret Wycherley was attractive as
Hulda Brown, the school -teacher, and
Marie Howe - and , Georgie .Woodthorpe
were excellent as Captain .Tommie.. and
Bunker Hill, respectively. .Little 'Ollie
.Cooper was Georgie and played the part
-intelligently. Â¦ The.play.ia well staged.

"The Pride of Jennico," which Is the of

emotions are skillfully played upon.
The honors of the production are shared

the eligible list were dismissed, were
forced out on the protest of the Civil Ser

Works retained Hunter and Duddy be
cause of their efficiency, but succumbed
to the dictum of the commission and dis
p'.aced them by reappointlng Thomas
Shea and James Murray, who headed the
eligible list. Hunter and Duddy now
threaten to retaliate by securing evidence
that Shea and Murray were illegally
placed on the eligible list.
The complaining witness repeated on

to Postofflce Inspector D. Coyne, that,
calling at the postofflce in Calistoga one

Ministerial Meetings.
There waa the Â¦ usual large attendance
at the : -weekly ministers', jineetins: yes
terday. The Baptists were addressed . by
the Bey. Dr. Baldwin. of Alameda. Rev.
Kobert Ritchie of .St. Paul's, Oakland,
delivered a scholarly paper on "Ministe
rial Support'' before the Episcopalian min
isters. .At the Methodist ministers' meet
ing a committee of five, composed of Rev.
Drs. Bain, Briggs, Baker, Stephens and
Latimer, was appointed, to appear before
the : Supervisors and protest against the
opening of Ingleside. Rev. Dr. Heff of
Salt Lake 'addressed the meeting. He
dwelt on the importance of the work ; of
the Church. Extension Society. . '.:. ;
It is said that the remarks were made before
the Jury was impaneled. This makes no dif
ference. They were made in presence of all the
Jurors. It matters not. therefore, whether they
were in the Jury bor or outside the railing of
the courtroom. There is no pretense that the"
Jurors present did not hear the remarks. The
remarks of the court, if erroneous, had the
same effect as an erroneous instruction given
to the Jury regularly impaneled.
The United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals said yesterday in commenting upon
the remark made by Judge Noyes:
Judge Arthur H. Noyes, sitting on the
bench, said: "It happened that the state
ment was made In the presence of Mrs.
Arthur H. Noyes and myself by Mrs.
Thomas Noyes."
District Attorney Joseph K. Wood, now
incarcerated In the San Francisco Coun
ty Branch Jail for contempt of the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals, stated
that the counsel for the defense wanted
Tom Noyes to swear that he gave George
Allen money to play faro, but that he
didn't do it-
This testimony would account for the
$100 In bills found upon the prisoner after
the robbery.
Would Account for $100 in Bills
The foregoing impressive words spoken
yesterday morning by Judge Thomas P.
Hawley of the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals will be perpetuated in
the printed reports of the court's pro
ceedings as a standing monument of the
fairness and impartiality of the United
States courts. They occur in the opinion
written by him on behalf of the court
reversing the decision of Judge Arthur H.
Noyes of the District Court of Alaska in
the case of the United States vs. George
Allen, indicted for highway robbery. Al
len was shown to have a bad reputation
and was sentenced to fourteen years' Im
prisonment in the penitentiary. The case
attracted considerable attention in Wash
ington and Alaska, because the prisoner,
who Is but 21 years of age. is said to be
a son of Senator Allen of Washington.
The defendant's counsel appealed on
three groundsâ first, because the court re
fused to allow a continuance to secure
the testimony of Thomas Noyes, brother
of the Judge; second, because Judge
Noyes made a remark in the presence of
the talesmen that tended to prejudice
their minds against the prisoner, and
third, because the court allowed questions
to be asked of the defendant on the
cross-examination as to his past record,
whith questions were irrelevant to the
case at bar and tended to prejudice the
jury against the defense. The defend
ant's counsel had stated that . Thomas
Xoyes would testify, if present, that he
gave the defendant $100 in Canadian bills
on the morning preceding the robbery to
play in a faro game.
Said to Be a Son of a Senator.
"This is a sacred boon granted to every
person and of which no one should ever
be deprived.- The law, in its extended
reach, is as tender of the rights of the
man who Is supposed to be bad as It is
of the liberties and rights of the man who
is believed to be good. The trial of every
man should be free from undue prejudice
or odium, especially upon the part of all
officers clothed with the power and
charged with the duty of maintaining the
law in such a manner as to reach the
ends of justice and of right."
"AH men stand equal before the law
and have the same constitutional rights
anc priviiegres. The high and the low,
the poor and the rich, the criminal and
the law-abiding when indicted and ac
cused of crime are entitled under the law
to a fair and impartial trial.

The reports not only indicated the con
dition of the board, but also told of the
general transactions of the year. The
president alluded to the demise of Charles
F. Tay, Herman J. Sadler, Benjamin 1.
J^acy, Samuel Stemheim, Otto Muser.
Samuel Feder and Leopold Breuner, all
members of the board, who, as the presi.
dent phrased it, have during the past year
"balanced their accounts, closed their
books and joined the silent majority."
Tables of business transactions were re
ported. From these it appeared that dur
ing the twenty-five years of the work of
the board there were 11,515 failures on the
Pacific Coast, in which the total of liabil
ities was $72,75<S.2S:>. The average liabil
ities per firm in this great amount of dis
asters were $6221 IS. and the total of re
coveries was 532.072,799. the average per
cent cÂ£,settlements being 52.32.
The failures in California in the year
3901 numbered 422 and the liabilities
amounted to S2.146.C3S. The membership
of the board was reported to be 192, a loss
of five during- the year. The treasurer ot
the board has S15.782 GO in cash on hand,
a decrease of $253 06 for the year.
The following donations were made by
the board for the benefit of the public.
In addition to this matter of importance
the board listened to annual reports from
President Watkins, Secretary H. L. Smith
and Attorney Kirk and elected directors
to fill vacancies and also officers for the
year. The directors, each of whom sue
ceeds himself, are: A. A. Watkins, H.
11. Holbrook and William ClufL The offi
cers elected are: President. A. A. Wat
kins; first vice president, William Cluff;
second vice president, Leopold Michaels;
treasurer, Sanford Bennett; secretary. H.
L. Smith; attorney, Joseph Kirk.
The San Francisco Board of Trade at
its annual session yesterday afternoon
discussed the interesting subject of fraud
ulent debtors and their punishment. Two
plans were suggested, the. one in most
detail originating with Sanford Bennett.
His idea was that the Board of Trade
should provide a fund of some size, but
that this fund should not be available
until the creditors should have paid 50
per cent of the costs for prosecution of
fraudulent individuals. Director Nickels
burg moved that the whole matter be left
to a committee of seven members to be
appointed by President A. A. Watkins.
The motion prevailed and the committee
will be appointed with instructions to pre
pare a pian tcr prosecution by the board,
such plan to be finally voted upon by
every member of the board before it is to
be considered as being in force. .

RECEPTION IS TENDERED

I respectfully submit, therefore, that it is
the duty of your Honor to suggest to the Grand
Jury that they should not be influenced by
the unwarranted and uncalled for language
used In said communication, and that said jury
should be advised as to the law, and thoy
should only take the law from the Judges of
the Superior Court or the District Attorney.
The sole contention urged by that writ was
the clear legal proposition that the Mayor was
acting without Jurisdiction.
The Mayor further states in his communica
tion to said Grand Jury that the petition for
the writ of certlorari which I filed in the Su
perior Court in the case of Williams vs.' the
Mayor was based partly upon the ground' that
the charges against Williams were groundless.
This, I presume, is an unintentional
nrisstatement of fact.
Charges Misstatement of Fact.
I submit that this section was Intended to
apply only to the filling of vacancies in elec
tive offices, where the appointing power is not
lodged elsewhere.
The Mayor further advises the Grand Jury
that under section 4 of chapter 1 of article 4
of the charter he can fill any vacancy
which occurs in any office, irrespective of
where the appointing power is lodged.
On this subject I respectfully beg leave to
call your Honor's attention to the case of
People vs. Cobb, decided by the Supreme Court
of this State in April last, and reported in
133 Cal., where our Supreme Court directly
holds that the Justices of the Peace are State
officers.
Second â "The Justices' flimsy contention is
that the Justices of the Peace are State offi
cers, and that, therefore, the chief clerk Is a
State officer, and I advise that neither of
these contentions is sound."
First â "I respectfully request you to apply
to said Justices the provisions of sections 75S
to 772, inclusive, of the Penal Code of the
State of California."
These provisions apply to district, county,
township and municipal officers only.
Furthermore, in Instructing the Grand Jury
as to the law, the Mayor uses the following
language :
I submit that no citizen, no matter how dig
nified his office may be, has the right In a
communication to the Grand Jury to employ
the language abore quoted, as the same is cal
culted to Influence said jury In the determina
tion of the -question pending before them. -Â¦
language With a Sting.
Tenth â "When one member of an unclean
political organization is forced to retire under
tire, his place should not be at once filled by
a member of the same political machine."
Ninth â "Mr. Windrow â¢ â¢ â¢ is clearly a
usurper liable in my judgment to criminal
prosecution."
Eighth â "My judgment is that it is willful
misconduct for the Justices to take such ac
tion. The Justices' flimsy contention is that
the Justices of the Peace are State officers and
therefore the chief clerk is a. State officer."
Seventh â "In support of their unholy com
bination the Justices have threatened and In
timidated lltlrants."
Sixth â (Referring to Clerk Windrow)
"Where he holds forth with as much authority
as though he were the veriest stranger claim
ing on the street corners to be authorized to
receive and to appropriate public moneys."
Fifth â "The Justices in order to carry out
their bold and audacious attempt to Install
another member of the push in the place of the
one who U deposed."
Fourth â "In his stead they assumed to
appoint Mr. Joseph Windrow, a copyist in the
County Clerk's office and a poltlcal colleague
of Mr. Williams."
, â¢ Third â "I respectfully submit that cqnduct
of this character should receive strenuous and
immediate consideration." i
First â The Mayor in his communication, . a
copy of which I herewith Inclose, uses the
following language: "I feel it incumbent upon
me to call your, attention to the arbitrary and
high-handed acts of the Justices of the Peace
of the city and county of .San Francisco."
Second â "The high-handed proceedings of the
last few days certainly call for drastic ac
tion."
Section 925 provides that the Grand Jury
can only receive advice as to the law from
the District Attorney or the Judges of the
Suj>erior Court.
Said statement Is inaccurate both as to the
law and the facts and contains therein mat
ters presumably intended to influence the
Grand Jury in this matter.
Section 019 provides that the Grand Jury "can
receive none but legal evidence, and the btst
evidence in degree to the exclusion of hearsay
or secondary evidence." I_t is unnecessary to
state that this means legal evidence under
oath. '
Questions of Evidence.
On Saturday Mayor Schmitz sent a com
munication to the Grand Jury in which
were embodied some very caustic com<
ments regarding the conduct of the Jus
tices of the Peace in appointing a succes
sor to Ed W. Williams, who was removed
from the offlce of Justices' clerk by the
Mayor and who later handed in. his resig
nation. Soon after /it was known that
Williams had resigned the Justices of the
Peace also removed . him and appointed
Joseph Windrow. This action formed the
basis of the Mayor's letter to the Grand
Jury. \
Attorney RIordan has replied and has
written to Judge Carroll Coot, instead of
the Grand Jury, giving his reasons there
for in the following communication:
Sir: I respectfully beg leave to call your
attention to a communication purporting to
have been forwarded by the Mayor ot this city
to the Grand Jury on Saturday last, which
communication contains a statement and an
argument on both Questions of law and fact
from the Mayor's standpoint in reference to the
controversy now pending as to the clerk of the
Justices' Court.
I have refrained from sending a renly to
said communication to the Grand Jury because
I consider the Mayor's communication a viola
tion of sections 910 and 925 of the Penal Code
of this State. ' -,-Â¦Â¦.
Opinions are varied as to who has the
power to eject Joseph Windrow from the
courtroom of Justice, of the ; Peace Groe
zinger, which he is now occupying as the
office of the clerk of the Justices' Court.
Mayor Schmitz's appointee, Powel 'Fred
rick,still 'holds the fort in the lower of
fice, but Windrow, with the aid of 'the
Justices, is doing the larger share of the
business. Â¦ â¢
Early ' yesterday morning Attorney
Thomas D. Kiordan, representing Wind
row, sent the following letter to the Board
of Public Works:
Gentlemen : I perceive by i the newspapers
that Â¦ the Mayor has instructed you to Â¦ prevent
Mr. Windrow, the duly appointed and acting
clerk of the Justices of the Peace of this city,
from occupying proper or any quarters I In the
City Hall. , N . Â¦ , .
I beg leave to inform you that the Justices
of the Peace have been decided by the Supreme
Court of this State to be State officers, and,
therefore, their appointee 1b a State officer and
is not subject to municipal jurisdiction. â¢
Further, any interference with Mr. Windrow
would be an interference with the courts and
with the due administration of justice.
I beg leave to further inform you that where
a vacancy occurs in the clerk's office of the
Justices of ' the Peace the appointing power
is vested solely in said Justices and not in any
other body or official. Â¦
Commissioners Casey and Manson called
upon Mayor Schmitz and talked the. mat
ter over with him, presenting the ordi
nances and rules of the Board of Super
visors and Board of Public Works. The
Mayor referred the matter to the Building
Committee of the Board of Supervisors.
The Supervisors' Building Committee
met at noon and considered a communica
tion from Mayor Schmitz stating that
Joseph Windrow was at the present time
occupying apartments in the chambers of
the Justices of the Peace without au
thority. The committee directed the clerk
.16 notify the Justices that* a room has
been assigned for the clerk of the\JusÂ»
tices' Court .and that the room should be
utilized .instead of a courtroom.
.At the close of business hours Windrow
was still In possession of his office.
The resolutions were then adopted .by a
Rising vote, and Mayor Schmitz an
nounced that carriages would be waiting
at the City Hall at 8:30 o'clock .this morn
ing to convey the Supervisors to the fu
neral. The board then adjourned out of
respect to the late Supervisor Dwyer'a
memory until this evening at 7:30 o'clock.
It was agreed that the session shall be
devoted to the investigation for fixing the
water rates and to such measures as re
quire final passage only, i
â¢ The pallbearers for Supervisor Dwyer's
funeral so far as selected are Supervisors
Curtis, Connor, John Behan, Assistant
'Clerk of the Board of Supervisors John
Rippey, representing the Red Men; Mar
tin Fragley, from the Lodge of Work
men; William McCann, Young- Men's
Catholic Union; E. D. Sullivan, and one
representative of the Builders' Exchange.
â¢ May the first daisies of springtime and the
last rose of summer bloom among the grasses
that cover his clay. May the softest breeze
that blows from *ne westerr sea kiss the cold
rt"iip above his head. Mry even the winter
winds and chlllinc rains sing a soft lullaby
around the snot .vncre God s angel rcc^eJ iiim
to sleep, and may God hlmsilf "who glveth
every perfect rift" grant eternal r.Â»tÂ»t and
peace to his soul, which has Entered that great
door "which opening to let in lets out no
ruore."
In a few short hours his remains will be
laid in "God's acre," the beautiful, silent clty
of the dead, where it is: my last wish and
prayer that the sun' might shine all day and
the moon beam all night, upon his grave.
' Our friend, our associate, our fellow Su
pervisor, my companion, "Larry" Dwyer is
dead. I would if I could take away the crape
from his seat, place him once more among us
and tell him how much we all loved him, but
no, he is dead. A great and noble heart that
ever loved the true and beautiful has ceased
to live and lov.? forevermore. Â¦
Pays Tribute to a Good Man.
Struggling manfully against adverse circum
stances, he rose to his present position In this
city and State and has left his wife and chil
dren an honored and honorable name. In my
judgment ' he gave hla life for his friends.
Noble, brave, generoua to a fault, tender
hearted and true, .he seemed ; only to f ollow,
out 'the advice 'of the seer of olden time,"
"Whatever kindness I can do for any one let
me do it now,, for I shall never pass this way
a^ain.'*
He is tone. "Larry" Dwyer is dead. Never
again will we, fÂ«el the warm grasp of h!s
hand. Never again will . he answer rollcall.
Never again will hin voice be raised In behalf
of honest municipal government.
I have known him since boyhood. 3 He and
I were raised together; have, played together;
took our vacations together; loved each other
most tenderly, and I can truthfully say that
whatever "Larry" Dwyer wai he attained
through his own exertions. .
In the - board, as the record will sfcow, his
voice was always raised and his vote always
recorded In behalf of -the people. - z'.\
In moving the adoption of these resolutions I
cannot help but express my feelings that never
have resolutions been adopted by any body of
men with more sincerity and with the knowl
edge that every word contained therein . is lit
erally and absolutely Â¦ true. Lawrence J.
Dwyer lived and died an honest man. Super
visor Braunhart . can tell you that during his
six years of association- with him in the As
sembly and Senate of this State no breath of
suspicion, ever touched the hem of his gar
ment, and that the one virtue that outshone
all the rest was his unquestioned honstey.
Supervisor Curtis then delivered ' a eu
logy on the worth and character of the
late Supervisor. Curtis and his associates
were .visibly affected, thus- testifying to
the esteem in which "Larry" Dwyer, as
he was best known, was held. Curtis
said: , Â¦ Â¦Â¦-Â¦-Â¦ '-.,.:..'.
Supervisor Curtis' Eulogy.
Resolved, That this Board of Supervisors will
attend the funeral In a body; that these reso
lutions be entered in the journal; that a copy
thereof be transmitted to the family, and . -
Resolved, That we do now adjourn out of
respect to his memory. -
Resolved, That this Board of Supervisors
extend to his wife and family Its heartfelt
sympathy in their great bereavement ; and â¢ be

Resolved, That in the death, of Supervisor
Dwyer this municipality has lost an able, con
scientious and faithful public official, and one
who has endeared himself to every member of
this board by his geniality, unassuming mod

.Whereas, Throughout his official career, as
a member of the Assembly, State Senator,

.After maturely meditating upon that answer : St.

Â¦ Here, then, is a remarkable prophet indeed, and it
is not surprising. to learn that a further examination
was made of him.;. Asked to give a full and explicit
explanation of the prophecy the prophet said: "I was
told by the Lord some time ago that he intended to
visit an earthquake^ upon St. Louis, but I' supposed
that he had changed his mind. I put the advertisement
in the papers just, to have a little fun. It only cost
me 30 cents. But I didn't expect to tell- the truth.
Of course the Lord had spoken of the earthquake,
but the date had been postponed indefinitely."
STi LOUIS is furnishing the world with another
instance of a prophet without honor in his
own country. Such instances are so frequent
that ordinarily they attract little attention and merit
no special comment, but this one, while not import
ant, is sufficiently interesting to be worthy of notice.
It affords a proof of the old saying that "you can't
most always sometimes tell" that a man is a liar
merely because he undertakes to prophesy without
knowing.
* Just before the recent earthquake in St. Louis a
man went to the newspapers of the city and inserted
a small advertisement announcing that on the follow
ing Friday there would be an earthquake. The pre
diction came true "as advertised." 'Attention having
been thus directed to the prophet, he was sought out
and investigated. To the surprise of those who .un
dertook the investigation the prophet expressed the
Â¦greatest astonishment when informed that his
prophecy had been fulfilled. It appears that between Â¦
the day when he inserted the "ads" and the day when
the fulfillment came he had become so absorbed in
'other things that he had not only forgotten all about
his prediction but did not even 1 so much as notice that
St. Louis had a shake-up.

By degrees, which are neither slight nor slow, the
Russo-Chinese Bank is getting control and dominion
in Manchuria. It is up to the nations to decide what
they are going to do about it. China has not been
asked to grant any special privileges to Russia, and
accordingly neither the United States, Great Britain,
Germany nor Japan has any right to complain. A
great power cannot declare war against a corporation,
and so the bank is having everything its own way.
In its last analysis the Russian scheme is that of
acting through a corporation instead of as a nation.
There has been created an organization known as
"The Russo-Chinese Bank." It is doing a land of
fice business in Manchuria. It carries on negotiations
with China and demands privileges, rights and fran
chises on a large scale. Russia is not responsible for,
its acts. It has nothing to do with diplomacy, poli
tics or war. It is in Manchuria strictly for business,
and is devoting its energies to the financing of rail
ways and to obtaining trade concessions. It deals
with the Chinese Government and with the Russian
Government, but exclusively as a corporation.
A NOVEL problem for diplomacy ha # s been de
veloped in Manchuria, where Russian in
genuity has devised a puzzle never before set
up for the study of the wise men of the nations. In
its way it is quite simple, but the solution is going
to be difficult, and accordingly it is not at all improb
able that other nations will imitate the example
whenever they wish to undertake a great coup with
safety tp themselves and damage to everybody else.

PERSONAL MENTION.
These salient differences .between the associations
that favor the adoption of the gambling ordinance
and those that oppose it must be given Hue considera
tion. The Supervisors cannot afford to overlook the
moral sentiment of the community in an issue of this
kind. Finally, the people should bear in mind that
the issue is to come r.p next Monday. Let the oppo
nents of the measure be there to protest against it
firmly and emphatically.
The resolutions adopted in opposition to the pro
posed ordinance come from associations of quite a dif
ferent kind. They emanate from the Law. and Order
League^ the Good Government Club, the Iroquois
Club and similar organizations which exist for other
purposes than that of promoting the trade of their
members. The argument embodied in these resolu
tions' runs to the general welfare of the community,
and is based upon the evil produced in the city when
racetrack gambling was in full blast at Ingleside be
fore the indignation of the public forced its cessation.
In estimating the amount of consideration due "to
the various resolutions the Supervisors should not
overlook the difference between the intent of thc^se
uho favor the scheme and that of those who oppose
it One set? desire the ordinance adopted because it
will improve their business. The other set oppose the
ordinance without respect to business from purely
moral considerations. The supporters of the project
are men who see the probability of a gain to their bus
iness by attracting to the city the crowds that patron
ize racetracks. They- are such men as brewers,
saloon-keepers, cigar-dealers and dealers in hay, grain
and other supplies used by horsemen. Their plea is
for the pocket. They argue that the opening of the
track will improve the business of, the city, that it will
make trade and custom for saloons, cigar stands and
breweries. Every other factor of the problem is
dismissed from the consideration of these men. It
matters little to them what may be the moral effect
upon the community, or how much of the genuine
financial strength of the people may be lost by the
squandering of earnings in track gambling. Their
one thought is for their own pockets.
The issue is an important one, and, furthermore, it
ig one concerning which the people are not indiffer
ent. Already many organizations and associations
of the citizens have taken action and adopted resolu
tions concerning it. These resolutions are not. in
any way perfunctory- They express the earnest sen
timent of a considerable proportion of the people,
and it behooves the Supervisors to give them due
attention.
OUT of deference to the memory of the late
Supervisor Dwyer there was no meeting of
the Board of Supervisors for business j'ester
<iay, and as the adjourned meeting to-day is expected
to be short, consideration of the resolution' providing
for the reopening, of Ingleside Park for racetrack
gambling goes over until next Monday. The ar
rangement gives the public another week in which
to protest against the scheme and the Supervisors
that amount of time to maturely consider it.

ANSWERS TO* QUERIES.
DR. JAMES NICHOLAS VANN of <Â£oshen, N. Y., who is looking for his
fourteenth wife, is so bothered by lonely women who want to marry him
on the spot that he is becoming alarmed. He has issued a warning that
undesirable women must keep away. '
Any young, nice looking, plump blond'e of sunny disposition may ap
ply, but all old and wrinkled come at their- peril.
"A young and lovely woman," says Dr. Â«Vann, who is 94 years of age, "is the
human heart's delight, but the old, designing woman, who insists on marrying
you whether you are willing or not, is a jackal and a beast of prey. I shall greet
them as such." Â». .
Dr. Vann was a famous hunter at one time and devoted years to the capture
â¢of wild animals for Dan Rice, the circus man. The doctor thinks his determined
attitude will scare away all the old girls. ' Â¦ t
Â¦' "My first twelve wives were fair arjd lovely women, and are undoubtedly now
with the "angels," said Dr. Vann. "My thirteenth wife was not, and her name I
will not mention. She is,, living to-day. The names of the first \ twelve were
Susan Westbrook, her sis\er, Nancy, and their aunt, Mrs. Kate Westbrook, all
of Milford, Pa.; Miss Mary E. Petton of Dingmans; Addle Graham of Williams
burg, Va.; Sarah E. Deerpomp of Philadelphia; Mary Jane Conkling of Phila
delphia; Miss Susie Corvdn of Milford, Pa.; Miss Annie Harding of Philadel
phia; Margaret J. Case of Denver; Miss Ada Mlneholdt of Denver; Miss Julia De
Wet of Indianapolis; Miss Gertrude Laymont of Indianapolis, and the" 'Belle of
Orange County,' the thirteenth." >
Â£ "Dr. Vann," he was asked,, "have -you thought of the reunion which will take
place in the joyous hereafter?"
"Yes,' indeed," replied the old man; "If I were to meet all my deceased wives
in any other place I fear the green-eyed monster would enter their hearts, but,
as all is happiness over there, I shall depart this life when the final summons
comes without trepidation. . I know that each of my deceased wives would rather
have me be happy than plodding around the world alone. Therefore I intend to
marry again, and I trust my fourteenth wife may be in form and feature a com
posite picture of all the rest and the embodiment of their many virtues."

In the early years of the republic the adoption of
constitutional amendments was comparatively easy.
No less, than thirteen amendments were made in the I
lifetime of the first generation of the people. Since
then we have had none except those which were
necessary to embody into the fundamental law the
results of the Civil War. The difficulties in the way
of furiher amendment now are well nigh insuperable.
There has developed among the people a veneration
for the constitution which was not felt by the gene- i
ration fliat first established it as a form of govern
ment. Moreover, experience has/shown that the
courts can by liberal construction fit constitutional
law to the changing conditions of the country. John
Marshall taught us how to. make a constitution de-.
signed for a federal republic suit the development of
a national republic. It has been found comparatively
easy for the courts to give to Congress about every
power needed to preserve the welfare of the people in
war or in peace, and there is a fair assurance that if
Congress. reaHy ought to have the powers it is pro
posed to confer by. several of the. amendments now
before Congress a means would be found of recog
nizing their existence in some of the "implied pow
ers" which the constitution vests in the National
Government.
Under such circumstances "it is not likely the
amendments now before Congress will occupy much*
attention. The only one that has a large support is
that providing. for the election of Senators by direct
vote of the people, and even that is not demanded
half so urgently now as it was a few years ago when
Senatorial election scandals were rife everywhere
from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

The fact - that "so many amendments are advocated

The second assembly last evening of thÂ«
Friday Night Club for this season was a
brilliant affair. The event has been looked
forward to with especial interest since the
first revival of the dances on January 1J
by E. M. Greenway. Fully three hundred
guests thronged Native Sons' Hall last
night and the pleasure was all that had
been anticipated. Many beautiful and
costly gowns were worn. The affair was
conducted on the lines of the last cotil
lon; no reception committee, but an In
formal dance to begin with and two good
bands to furnish the music. As several
dinners were given before the assembly
the guests were a little late in arriving
and dancing did not begin until 11 o'clock.
An elaborate supper was served down
stairs at midnight, after which dancing
was resumed until 3 a. m. The hall was
decorated even more than on the last sim
ilar occasion. Pink was the predominat
ing color. Interspersed with considerable
foliage.
The stage was solidly set with palm9
and other foliage.
Mr. Greenway was floor manager and
added much to the enjoyment of those
present.
In all probability the old Friday Night
Club will be revived with added zest next
year now that the experiment has proved
bo decided a success. The Invited gue3t3
were:
A minority should be useful to the country. It
should not be merely an opposition, without reason
nagging at all majority propositions. Properly led
and inspired it performs an important function in
free government. That the present minority is in
capable of doing good or doing harm is a situation
novel in our politics and one that should inspire a
degree of anxiety in the country.
when the first balker wants to pull the puller takes
his turn at balking, so they never get ahead at all,
nor do they stand still at the same time.
The great issues pending were unspoken of. . The
Philippines tariff, and the revenue status of Cuban
products, the isthmian canal and even legislation in
restraint of trusts, all administrative measures of the
first rank, were passed in gloomy silence. Mr. Bur
leson explained this by declaring that there are pro
tectionist Democrats in the South and free-traders in,
the North, imperial expansionists in the party in one
place and continentalists in another, some believing
that the constitution follows the flag, and others that
it stays at home while the flag goes a-roving. Yet
they are all trying to'belong to the same party. One
day the expansionists vote with the Republicans on that
subject and are roundly abused by their protection
ist Democratic brethren. The next day the latter vote
f with the protectionist Republicans and are in turn
abused by the free-trade expansionists. It is like a
team of balky horses which will not both balk at
once. When one wants to pull the other balks, and
Only unfeeling partisanship can rejoice over the
pitiful picture. The condition which if implies is not
wholesome for the country, but the Republican party
can hardly be expected to go out with a bottle of
tonic and a spoon to dose and nurse its opponent
into fighting trim. Nor can the majority party be
expected to do other than cuff the minority, which
officially admits its incompetence and loss of self
respect. Mr. Burleson wanted vote down the
McClellan resolutions and reaffirm Bryanism. \ But
at the end of his despairing speech the party declared
that it had no faith in itself and the caucus adjourned
after voting upon that cardinal political subject and
burning national issue, statehood for New -Mexico
and Arizona. â¢
When Congress met in December McClellan intro
duced a sort of declaration of faithlessness in Bryan
and Bryanism. It' was laid over until after the re
cess and then came up in a full caucus and was
adopted. In its discussion Mr. Burleson .of Texas
made an extended speech, in which he described the
low estate to which the party has fallen from its for
mer high place. He declared that it- has lost the con
fidence of the country, repels first-class men from its
leadership, is no longer able to defend its own prin
oiples, is not possessed of its own self- respect, and
that its attacks upon the Republican party excite only
derision and contempt.
IN /the history- of American parties , no other such
forlorn incident is recorded as the second caucus
of the Democratic minority in the present House
of The party has no straight Gov
ernor nor Legislature left in_a Northern State. It
has fusion power in Montana, Idaho, and Colorado,
and its only surviving national representative is the
minority in the house. . It seems so brief a time since
it controlled New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,'
Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa and California, to
gether with every State south of Mason and Dixoh's
line,. that one is attracted by the ruin' and contem
plates the fall in a vein of grave philosophy.

An influential element of the church
membership opposed Dr. Evans' return
here and the withdrawal of support is
probably in the nature of a boycott. Dr.
Evans is a particular friend of Bishop
Hamilton. The pastor lives in an elegant
home and has a salary of $175 per month
and it is said that the church is less than
two months in arrears.
The clergyman accompanied the latter
remark with a downward motion of his
right index finger by way of emphasizing
the direction which those who had failed
to pay would have to take. One paper
says the pastor declared tha,t In addition
to having walked the streets penniless he
had â¢ also been hungry. â¢

will reply. . -=
"Why, Mr. So and So, how does this happen?
What is the meaning of this long blank here?
Tou have not paid up your church bills."
"Well,", you will be forced to say. "I did
fail to pay up a small amount."
Then St. Peter will "look over the accounts
and find a long blank after your name, showing
unfulfilled obligations, and he will say:
"What is your name?"
I'll get to heaven all right. I'll go there.
But some of you people who are walking
around Stockton with my money in your pock

The schooner Kilminy of Victoria, B. C,
has established a record. She arrived at
Esquimault the other day from Sooko
Harbor, a-distance of twenty-five miles.
She was ten days making the trip. Cap
tain J. Mugford, in his report of the voy
age, says he encountered head winds and
storms that compelled him to run for
shelter every f ev/ hours. His anchor
chain was almost worn through when he
finally made port. '.

Reinsurance on the British ship Red
Rock Vas yesterday reduced from 25 per
cent to 20 per cent. This makes a total
reduction In a few days of 30 per cent.
The rate' on the Dutch steamship Folmina
remains at 15 per cent, but on the three
overdue Frenchmen there aas been a raise
of 5 per cent. They are now' quoted:
Oliver de Clisson, 149 days from Cayenne
to this port, 20 per cent; Les Adelphes, 112
days, Madagascar to Portland, 20 per cent;
and Ernest Legoure, 124 days, Mauritius
to Portland. 20 per cent.

ThC Coqullle River came into port yes
terday from Fort Bragg with a cargo of
lumber that completely disguised the
sturdy coaster. Her deck load was pned
level with the top of her smokestack. As
the General Sternberg passed the floating
woodpile one of the quarantine doctors
hailed the skipper of the Coqullle River:
"Ahoy, there. Oh, Captain! Is there
any lumber left at Fort Bragg?"' Â¦ Â¦
"A little, doc!" replied Captain Johnson.
"We hadn't time to have our smokestack
lengthened." â¢

Mrs. Fremont has been receiving from
the Government a pension of $2000 a year
and this, together with the comfortable

rendered her helpless and made necessary
many extra expenses incident to such a
misfortune. Now Miss. Fremont says the
pension is not adequate for their needs
and is looking- hopefully to the time when
her mother's right to a tract of land at
Point San Jose, in the city of San FranÂ«
Cisco, shall be recognized. This land is
worth about $50,000, but the Mexican and

a barrier to her claim and for year* she
has been kept out of her own right, if the

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 3.â Reports being
circulated in the East to the effect that
Mrs. Jessie - Benton Fremont, widow of
General Fremont, the "pathfinder," is ill
and in need are misleading, and have given
distress to her friends in this city. Sirs.
Fremont is at her home on West Twenty
eighth street and Is 'in her usual good
health. It is true that Mrs. Fremont is
crippled and will never again be able to
walk. Some time ago she fell, dislocating
her hip. Since then she has been help
less, so far as walking is concerned, and
has required the constant attendance of
a trained nurse. Her general health, how
ever, is good and it. is believed that her
life may be spared for some Â«years to
come.

Reports Concerning 1 the Condition of

"If the Condor was in collision with
anything," he is reported as having said,
"it was more likely the British ship Red
Rock, which our tug Home towed to sea
November 29."
Among the officers and crew of the miss
ing British sloop of war Condor, are a
number of survivors of the earlier fights
of the British-Boer war in South Africa.'
Sergeant of Marines Edgson, who is the
schoolmaster on board, was the only one
of his section of the naval brigade to sur
vive the battle of Traspan. He was se
verely wounded and was barely convales
cent when ordered to the Condor. He has
a wife and family in Scotland. Captain
Libby of Seattle, from whose office ema
nated the theory that the Condor and
Matteawan collided, declares the proba
bility of such an occurrence to be slight.
He thinks it most unlikely that. the Mat
teawan turned back. .

and nearing her destination a
couple of days ago, when she was spoken
off Cape Flattery by the steamship Glen

three days, and judging by the time' other
sailing vessels are taking to make the trip
has not deserved a place on the reinsured

had encountered the typhoon that bat

other vessels on their way to this' coast
from Manila that have been out longer
than the Kelverdale, but whose non-arri

ONE OF Â¦ THE PRETTIEST SAILING SHIPS ON THE PACIFIC OCEAN."
THAT ARRIVED AT MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA, YESTERDAY AFTER
A REMARKABLY QUICK RUN OF El DAYS FROM SAN FRANCISCO.
The Superior Court resolved itself into
& magistrate's court for a short time this
morning to permit Raker to make appli
cation to Judge Harrington to release
Fred Roberts and seven others who have
been confined In the county jail since
January 10 for the murder of the Halls,
Daniel Yantls and Martin Wilson, with
out having been granted a "preliminary
hearing. The application was denied.
Judge Harrington saying x.e was engaged
in the case of Brown, and had not had
time to give the men a preliminary hear
ing. Raker then asked the court to issue
an order to the Sheriff to take the men
before the nearest magistrate for prelim
inary examination. The court cut him off
in a peremptory manner, denying the ap
plication and advising him to take the
case to the Supreme Court for adjudica
tion.
Cal Raker objected to the remarks of
the court as "highly improper," and he
and his brother came in for a lecture from
the bench on the way they have entered
objections in the past. The court said he
would send them to Jail for five days if
they ever again added to their exceptions
to the rulings of the court the words
"higrhly improper" or others of similar
import.
Post asked Miss Kresge if she had ever
had read to her or heard read any of the
testimony given by witnesses In this case.
Raker objected and the court ruled that
she might answer, saying that if such had
been the case it might have had some
bearing on her testimony.
Court Censures the Bakers.
Miss Carrie Kresge, a sister of Jervus
Kresge, was called to the stand to
strengthen the alibi of her brother. Her
testimony bore out the evidence of .the
Millers, given on Saturday. She said
Kresge was at home all day on May 25,
the day on which it has been said he ac
companied the posse which arrested the
Halls. The witness testified that her
brother went to Lookout on May 2S and
remained all afternoon. That was the day
when, according to John Hutton, Kresge
Â¦was in Lookout in consultation Â¦with Hut
ton and "Jim" Brown regarding the
lynching.
Sturtevant continued to ask questions
on the ground already traversed and a
protest followed. Sturlevant withdrew
one objectionable question and the court
did not rule on the objection. Spencer
evidently did not hear the withdrawal of
the question and remarked to the court: Â¦
"That is the kind of a rotten deal you
give us, is it?"
Judge Harrington evidently did not hear"
the remark cr it might have gone hard
with Spencer.
Warm Talk by Spencer.
The court â Raker, you stoa that. Do you
vant to go home to-night? (Equivalent to a
threat of jail for contempt.)
Kresge's testimony agreed in almost
every particular with that already given
by other witnesses regarding his where
abouts and doings previous and subse
quent to the lynchings. Kresge was asked'
to leave the stand in order to demonstrate
to the jury that he was not stoop-should
ered or bow-legged, as testified to by Doth
Hutton and Morris in their identification
of him as a member of the lynching par
ty. It, was clear to the spectators that
Kresge was both bow-legged and some
what stoop-shouldered. \
During the cross-examipation Sturte
vant, for the prosecution, read several
pages of Kresge's testimony before the
Grand Jury. This brought forth a protest
from Spencer, who said the prosecution
was conducting the case in a fraudulent
manner. Raker made the further objec
tion that counsel for the prosecution was
going over the old ground for the purpose
of taking up the time of the court.
The ccart â I don't believe a word of it.
Raker â I don't have to believe the court,
either.
The court â Raker, you stop that. Tou are
trying- to get urÂ» a quarrel.
-Rakei- â I don't propose to be Insulted from
the bench.'
ALTURAS, Feb. 3.â Jervus Kresge, one
of the alleged lynchcrs, .was on the stand
in the trial of James W. Brown this aft
ernoon. Attorney Raker made his cus
tomary pica that the eviderice given be
fore the Grand Jury be introduced, and
the court ruled, as he has many times be
fore, that this application was out of or
der. Krepge testified that he had never
participated in apy meeting held by the
alleged lynchers where the hanging was
discussed or plans of defense arranged. !

NEW TORK. Feb. 3. â The professional ele
ment Ktnong the stock operators showed ' a
rather hopeful . spirit this morning and started
with some confidence to' buy the transconti
nental Â¦ railroad stocks. The movement. seemed
to be based upon an assumption that the Su
preme Court would hand down its decision to
day in the Northern Securities Company case,
for within half an hour after the time for the
sitting of the court this morning's gains - In
these stocks had been wiped out. The dealings
in Southern Pacific were especially large and
gave evidence of operations by a speculative
pool. The buying of the stock is ostensibly
based upon the expectation of an early refund
ing of large issues* of bonds bearing a high
rate of interest and which mature In the ,next
few years. The financial, district was flooded
with very optimistic estimates of the current
earnings of the road. The price was carried
at one time 1 % over Saturday, but it fared
little better than the other Pacifies in the re
actionary movement, and closed with a net gain
of %. There were heavy dealings also In St.
Paul and Union Pacific, but their* gains were
entirely wiped out. Efforts were made to re-
Vive the market by inaugurating a movement
in the coalers. Lackawanna went up .14, very
little Â¦ stock coming out. . Rumors were revived
that the company's stock is to be doubled, with
valuable rights to present holders. . The deal
ings in Amalgamated Copper were on an enor
mous scale. â¢ the number of shares sold being
about the largest for a single day In the history
of the stock. It was under pressure throughout,
with occasional rallies, and late in the day fell
more than three points under Saturday, closing
with a net loss of 2%. Profit-taking was an
Important element In the weakness of the stock,
but there was a disposition to discredit recent
rumors of a combination with other copper
producers. The weakness of this stock did
not affect the early rise in the transcontinental
Etocks, but its depressing Influence gained force
later in the day. The large Increase in loans
by the banks last week was the sub ect of much
discussion without throwing much light upon
the uses. for which the borrowed money was
designed. The fact that nearly $10,000,000 of
the increase was made by two of the leading
banks in the Cle/iring-house which are affili
ated with the financial power which originated
most of the great combinations last year en
couraged the supposition that large syndicate
operations and possibly new projects are in
hand. The sudden and unexpected declaration
and disbursement of a 1. per .cent dividend on
Northern Securities stock might account for
part of the loans, although the public is igno
rant of what volume, of this stock has been ex
changed for that of the constituent companies
Subscriptions to a number of new railroad
bond issues might also be responsible The
money market continued easy, notwithstanding
the expectation that the outward movement of
gold is to be renewed. In fact, the ease of the
money market is the permissive factor in the
export of gold.
Railroad bonds were moderately active and
irregular. Total sales, $4,245,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call. â¢ â¢ Â¦

BERLIN, Feb. 3.â Christian Science waa
debated in the Reichstag to-day. While
considering a resolution asking the Gov
ernment to place insane asylums under
imperial control, Dr. Henrich Mueller
(Radical Association) said he thought the
Government should take action In the
"Mrs. Eddy swindle In Flotwell street,
Berlin." alluding to the establishment of
a certain Fraulein Schoen, where Dr
Mueller said, prayer healing was per
formed at two marks an hour, and that
jraulein Schoen had followers in the
higher circles of Berlin society.
Herr Stoecker (Conservative), formerly
court, preacher, said that Christian Sci
ence wats a product of bad philosophy and
worse theology imported from the United
States and that it should be made illegal
in Germany, as had" been done in Ameri-
Â» a- . Herr. Stoecker suggested that the
Reichstag appoint a commission to in
vestigate occult phenomena.
Count von Posadowsky-Wehner. Im
perial Secretary of State for the Interior
referring to this matter later, said
"Christian Science and spiritualism
h^' e^--i he same Psychological source
Which I. regard as quite dangerous Thera
are certain phenomena that impress even
the higher circles of society, and the
psychological causes can hardly be fath
omed. These come and go, and even Â£oÂ«ii

Movers therein cannot be combated by

WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â The Ways and
Means Committee of the House by unani
mous vote to-day ordered a favorable re
port on the war tax reduction bill. A
surprise occurred when Representative
Babcock (Rep.) offered his bill largely re
ducing duties on the steel schedule and
placing some articles on the free list as
an amendment to the tea repeal section.
The amendment was defeated. 6 to 7, Bab
cock and Tawney and all the Democrats
voting in the affirmative.
The Cuban reciprocity question also
came up unexpectedly, Representative
Steele of Indiana moving a 25 per cent
concession on Cuban sugar. The motion
was withdrawn, however, after a brief
exchange of comment.
Later in the day both majority and
minority reports were filed. The major
ity report says the probability of the
early withdrawal of the troops from Cuba
and the reduction of the force in the Phil
ippines will make further reductions pos
sible and also reviews the condition of
the treasury. In conclusion the majority
report says: .
It cannot be denied that a large surplus fur
nishes temptation for extravagant expenditure.
While Congress may generally be relied upon
to keen the national expenses within reason
able bound*. It should be relieved from the
pressure which comes with plausible schemes
Jrom every quarter to raid an overflowing treas
ury- â¢ . :
The minority report approves the pro
posed reductions, but asserts they should
have been made long ago. It also advo
cates a general revision of tariff taxation,
with the retention of taxes on accumu
lated wealth. There is a general denun
ciation of the Dlngley law as the mother
of trusts, and the report says that it en
ables the manufacturer to charge Jar
greater prices to home consumers than
are received abroad for the same gooda,
Â¦which is characterized as "plain robbery."
The minority report adds:
While approving in general the policy of re
pealing; the war taxes, we insist that the cer
tain taxes on accumulated wealth should be
allowed to remain. We refer to such taxes as
are imposed on sugar and petroleum refiners.
The tax of one-fourth of 1 per cent on the an
nual gross receipts of sugar and petroleum re
finers in excess of $250,000 yields about $1,000,
000 annually. This tax has been paid without
demur or protest and there Is no reason why
the great combinations which monopolize these
businesses, . and from which colossal individual
fortunes have been built up, should not pay
some part of the national expenses, as. well as
the masses of the people who use and consume
the various things which are the subject of cus
toms and internal revenue taxation. As the
Supreme Court has denied to Congress the rteht
to tax incomes for the support of the Govern
ment, It is well to place accumulated wealth
under some form of contribution, and we know
of none more Just or equitable than a tax such
as that impoped by the war revenue act on oil
and suear refiners. . .-Â¦'.:, . \ .

/. ? In the meantime the reliance of the commis
sion is on the small educated portion of I the
community, who form a- nucleus about Which
with the aid of American control, we think a
stable government can be erected.
Governor Taft said it will be found, on
investigation, that the surrenders by the
insurgents, of arms and men were far in
excess of the actual captures by the mili
tary. The municipal cudc was not put
into operation, he ,Â«aid, until after the
Presidential election of the United States
because of the unsettled condition of af
fairs, but as soon as it became known to
the people that'' tae commission had
thought it wise to provide for the election
of Governors, which occurs next month,
the Filipinos flocked to thorn with expres
sions of gratification. lie said that the
theory of the commission in the formation
of civil government is that the indispen
sable aid to the ultimate success of pop
ular g-overnment is the extension of edu
cation, but that the effect of this could not
be felt for a generationâ until the children
had grown to manhood. There were, he
said. 10,000 adults engaged in the study ot
Knglish. Continuing, ho said :
The pubordlnate military officers were Â« littl*
,bit contemptuous of what â¢Â¦ we were doing be
cause it fccemed to play so unimportant a part
in the situation, hut when th<? power over the
purse strings began to ttghtep In the rhetter
of appropriations those Â¦ gentlemen who were
ependinc the Islands', funds began to appre
ciate that there was some power behind the
commission. ' '
Answering a question by. Lodge, he. de-
Scribed the condition of the Island of
Bamar, where tho people are still in in
surrection, ami eaid he was not prepared
to state that this island was. never wholly
stibjccted to Spanish rule. -He then de
scribed the qualifications required for an
elector in the 'different .towns where the
commission had established governments,
fhene were that such persons, shall speak
and write English or streak 'and write
Spanish, or have filled ft municipal office
under" Spanish nlie or that he shall pay
$15 gold for taxes a year, i-' - - -
Governor Tall then entered upon a gen
eral narrative of .the wont of the com
mirsion. When the commission arrived
at Manila they fowiui the- peopie .divided
into thrpe olasÂ»!=o.Â«, -those in "favor 'of the
exclusion of American sovereignty altoÂ»
gether; tho SpAnlsh party, in rav'or of this
government; and a large body of ignorant
people, who were entirely indifferent.- :
Governor Tafr. paid that the instructions
to the commission, which gradually estab
lished civil government, had had a mar
velous effect. upon. the. people.' The insur
rection, he said.; :; had 'been most active in
September preceding the. elections in this
country, with the view of influencing
them, and for this reason it had been diffi
cult to bring the Filipinos to a discussion
of legislation which the commission was
enacting. There was doubt as to what the
policy of the United States would be.
Continuing, he said: ."
: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.-~Gbvernor .Taft
to-day continued his statement before the
Senate Committee on the Philippines re
garding the conditions existing in thosfe
islands.
Ford came upon the two men near the
corner of Fifth and Jefferson streets at
about 2 o'clock. They were lurking along
thfc dark side of the street, each carrying
a bundle. Before the suspects had time
to draw their weapons Ford had them
covered and ordered them to threw up
their hands. "While he was putting thÂ»
handcuffs on Carter's wrists Jones slipped
away and ran to Seventh street. Ho waa
caught at Seventh and Washington
etreets.
At the police station Carter confeasefl
that they had entered Mrs. Sorel's grocerr
and residence at Brush and Seventh
streets and the Venezia Garden on Sev
enth street, between Clay and Jefferson.
From Mrs. Sorel's they took silverware
and from the gardens a bottle of whisky,
a box of cigars and about $7 in nickels
from, the slot machine which they broke
open. .
Carter claims to belong In San Fran
cisco. Jones says he lives in West Berke
ley. The police are Investigating the rec
ords of the two prisoners, who are bath
young men. hoping to connect them with
the numerous recent burglarlps In Berke
ley. When, questioned by Chief Hodgkins
both showed considerable familiarity with
the university town. Carter's confession
completely covers the two burglaries done
here last night. Jones admits that the
police have a straight case against him,
but will say nothing further. Both claim
that this is their first criminal act. ;r:
OAKLAND, Feb. 3.â At the point of a
pistol John Carter, a burglar, suspected
of many crimes, was captured early this
morning by Special Policeman Ford with
plunder from two burglaries committed
last night. Carter's "pal" waa captured
later by Policemen Stahl and Flynn. He
gave the name of Harry Jones, and like
Carter was armed and loaded with spoils
Third â We ask for the removal of this book
from the school, because its retention is calcu
lated to antaganise the general community.
The protest was referred to the High
School Committee, consisting of Direc
tors Button, Isaacs and Knos, who asked
for further time in which to formally
report upon it. It was informally given
out, however, that the use of the book
v.as discontinued after a few readings
last term and was permanently dropped
from the list of prescribed text books.
The book against which the protest -was
aimed is a collection of selected Quota
tions from the Parables, the Psalms and
other portions of the Bible. It was in
troduced into the High School as a part
of the work in literature upon recom
rnendation of Principal James H. Pond.
Since the Board of Education unofficiallv
directed the work to be expunged from
ihe curriculura it has been withdrawn
from sale among the booksellers, Super
intendent McClymonds having notified
ihem that pupils would no longer require
the publication.
Second â Because it Is aÂ» tofrinsemect not
-or.iy of the rights of the Cathqlic pupils attend
ing the Hig* School, but aJso of the rights of
Â¦these of the Jewish faith, for these latter do
not accept the doctrines therein eet forth.
To rum mv tfcen, \ihat has been said, the
Catholics of this city ol Oakland and vicinity
numbering twenty odd thousand respectfully
Â£fik your honorabS? board lo order the disuse
â¢of this book called Bible Rcariir.cs in the Kiph
tk:hools of this city for the following reasons:
First â Because toeing a. Trortc of a sectarian
chcracter the r^adJns of it in a public school
is in violation ol oae of the articles of the con
stitution of this State.
By compelling the Catholic youth to listen
to its r*inE read you indirectly make an as
sault on their faith tnd by doing so yon make
"hem enemies of the eyeteni of education that
you desire to pramot-. while at the same time
you antac.r.iE^ tlie entire comuranity Â«t larjrt*.
Is this Ti-iEe, is it prudent, is it desirable?
The main body of the protest which fol
lows the forejroing: argrues that the selec
iJoiis contained in the book have doctrin
nl bearings and defines the Catholic po
sition regarding textual interpretation. It
conclude?:
That the liook in .question is of such -t char
scter, tbai U J* sectarian when read without
n< :te or oonuaeat little n<^d be paid, for every
one knows that U is= from the reading thi
Bible without cxr'snation thai all the Chris
tian spcu? novr in ihe world, and they are nu
merous, have originated. I< it not because
men have hMerprttPd the sacred text in differ
ent MM that v.e have so many different
Christian crwds? One " man Interprets the
<livine word In one wnpe, another in a. diller
*:nt, and fo on. This iwing the case, the read
ing of such a volume as "Bible Readings"
mutt be regarded ae sectarian.
The (juf^ti'-a OttSi tfcat iiresents Itsslf to n
5b this; Is the reading of ibe 1'rotestaat ver
sion ol the ScrlptUiis, or of any other version
"whatever that may Ij<Â». sectarian In tr.e sense

Then follow extract? from the constitu

That Is the Mission of Good Food.
There is an abundance of proof that
food can be selected that â¢will build up a
brain as well as body.
One case Is that of a boy, and the de-
scription Is given by his mother. She says:
"This particular son has always had a
delicate stomach, and when he was an in-
fant had cholera infantum two or three
seasons in succession. He was exceeding-
ly hard to raise, and was not well enough
to go to school when he became old
enough."
The mother says: "Finally we concluded
to put him on Grape- Nuts exclusively and
see what the food would do for him. We
did, and to our great astonishment our
boy improved daily. He Is now hearty
and getting along in school unusually
well. He still. depends upon Grape-Nuts
for a goodly share of his diet.
"Whenever children are hungry at bed-
time it is always safe to let them eat
<3rape-Nuts and let them go to bed. I
came to know of the value of Grape-Nuts
by using it myself, and found that I was
unusually well nourished and gained rap-
idly in strength.
"Please do not use my name. By the
way. we abandoned coffee in our -family
several years ago, and have always used
Postum since. Would as soon have the
flour barrel empty as be out of Postum."

Catarrh has become such a common
disease that a person entirely free from
this disgusting complaint is seldom met
with. It is customary to speak of Catarrh
as nothing more serious than a bad cold,
a simple inflammation >of the nose-Â«nd
throat. It is, in fact, a complicated and
Very dangerous disease ; if not at first, it
very soon becomes so. .
The blood is quickly contaminated by
the foul secretions, and the poison through
the general circulation is carried to all
parts of the system.
Salves, washes and sprays are unsatis-

HELENA, Mont., Feb. 3.-Delegates to
the meeting of the Pacific Northwest
Wool Growers' Association i convention,
which begins a three days' session hero
to-morrow, "have been arriving all day,
and Secretary J..W. Bailey estimates that
1000 sheep breeders and wool growers will
be in attendance. . The local committees
have made every arrangement for the en
tertainment of the visitors, and both the
leading clubs have announced they_will
entertain the visitors.
The association comprises sheep grow
ers in Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Washing
ton, Utah and- Wyoming. In these States
there are 20,000,000 sheep, and, the wool
output, last year was 150,000,000 pounds.
The most important question that will
come up will be the passage of a law by
Congress requiring, that goods containing
shoddy shall be marked. Action will 'also
be taken on the land leasing question. It
is the intention Â¦ now.: for the association
.to select an agent who will represent the
interests of the wool growers at Wash

If enjoined, said Manager Wright while
on the. stand, the company would sus
pend smelting operations entirely and,
while it might continue 'to work its Iron
Mountain mine; it would do so only for
the best ore, which it would ship else
where to be smelted. A suspension of
the extensive operations of this company
would be a' sad blow to Shasta County
and the outcome of the caie is awaited
with interest, v
The enjoinment proceedings came up
to-day on the' continued hearing of the
case of Peter Stolberg against the Moun
tain Copper Company. Stolberg owns an
orchard near the town of Shasta,. which,
he claims, was damaged by the fumes
from the defendant corporation's smelter
at Keswick, three miles away. He asked
for $15,000 damages, and a jury awarded
him $600. The injunction pleadings now
come up separately before Judge Sweeny.
REDDING, Feb. 3.â Lewis T. -Wright,
general manager of the Mountain Copper
Company's operations in this county; said
while on the witness stand in .the Supe
rior Court this afternoon that if his com
pany were enjoined from proceeding with
the roasting and smelting of copper ores
until it should condense the fumes aris
ing therefromjt would be necessary to
close the big smelting plant at Keswick.

od of condensing the fumes of a copper

OIL MEN IN COTTJRT ON
CONSPIRACY CHARGE
I Â¦' resent the sneering remark of a foreign
diplomat that I am an agitator or a labor agita
tor, or that the laboring people of this country
are 'endeavoring, to protect' themselves from
Chinese labor are agitators.
I deny the right of the representative of a
foreign Government addressing himself to an
official of our Government and referring to such
American citizens by name, particularly where
such a- reference is of such a derogatory char
acter. The Chinese Minister Is treated in this
country with every becoming courtesy -and he
has no right to make insinuations upon Ameri
can "customs. - Upon behalf of the laboring men
of this country, whom I represent as the presi
dent of the Federation of Labor, I repeat that
I resent these remarks on the part of the Chi
nese- Minister. ' Â¦
Gompers spoke of the extent of Asiatic
contamination and demoralization of
our labor on the Pacific Coast. The Chi
nese worker who earns $2 and consumes
2 cents a day impoverished American la
bor and lowered the standards of liv
ing. To the arguments that had been ad
vanced that American v worklngmen
would have to meet European and Chi
nese standards of cheap living, Mr.
Gompers answered that If long hours and
low wages meant industrial superiority
then China would have been at th$ head
of the industrial nations of the world.
In the course of his rematks Gomp
ers criticized Wu Ting Fang, 1 *- the : Chi
nese Minister, saying:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â The House
Committee on Foreign Affairs-' heard
Immigration Commissioner Powderly and
President Gompers of the American Fed
eration of Labor in favor of strict Chi
nese exclusion, as provided for in the
Mitchell-Kahn bill, t Powderly stated that
the hardships encountered, by the' class" Of
Chinese exempt from exclusion at 'the de
tention stations were insignificant: : It 'waa
the duplicity of the Chinese laborer, he
said, who sought to gain : admission by
assuming to be in the exempt class, thai
caused the necessity for stringent exclu
sion laws.
The committee also struck out the
House provision limiting the number of
land offices in Alaska to one and reduced

crease are the following:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.â In response to
inquiries, the State Department to-day
notified the Senate Committee on Appro
priations that the department would bo
able to make provision for the expenses
of the representatives of this country In
England, incident to the coronation of
King Edward VII, from its resources and
that therefore no especial appropriation
Â¦would, be necessary for that purpose. The
committee therefore did not make provi
sion in the urgent deficiency bill as re
ported to the Senate to-day for this item
of expense, as it had agreed on Saturday
last to do. -The committee also decided
that the provision In the bill as it came
from the House for an appropriation of
$40,000 to be used by the President in
meeting "unforeseen emergencies" would
be sufficient to cover the expense of the
Government In connection with the ap
proaching visit of Prince Henry and no
specific appropriation was made on that
account.

ery of public, officials. These revelations Indi
cate that, men in high positions in the social
life and the commercial activities of. this com

bribe members of the Municipal Assembly to
betray the ' public interests and welfare they
were elected to protect.

Miss Pyatt in her testimony told how
Buckley had drawn a revolver and fired
four shots into Rice's bofly as he was
falling and as he lay on the ground. The
long cross-examination of Miss Pyatt in
the Police Court failed to'shake her tes
timony in the slightest degree, and the
testimony given by. her was listened to
most carefully when it was read to the
jury yesterday afternoon.
Walter B. Dexter, a machinist, was
called by the prosecution, and he testified
to the fact that- Rise was a non-union
workman during the recent labor strikes^
and that he was known as a "scab."
Dexter's evidence was presented in "or
der to connect Buckley with the state
ment he made on the night that Rice
was murderedâ that he, \ Buckley, "was
going out after a scab." " '
The further hearing of the trial will be
resumed this morning at 10 o'clock. . ..
Bucklev Fired Fatal Shots.
Police Jud&e Mogan was called to tes
tify. that Miss Erline .Pyatt had been a
witness in the preliminary examination of
/Buckley. Stenographer O. W. Long tes
tified to having taken- down the evidence
of Mfss .Pyatt, and 'identified the tran
script produced by the prosecution.
The. attorneys for Buckley made every
effort to keep the transcript out of the
case and quibbled over technical points.
In order to have the transcript admitted
Jn evidence the prosecution called Miss
Esther M. Gray, who testified that she
hud typewritten the transcript from dic
tation given by Stenographer Long, with
the exception of about 100 pages of the
document. Long testified that he. had him
self typewritten the balance of the trail-,
script. It was then admitted in evidence.
The bulk of the nfiertioon session was
taken up with the reading to the jury of.
the - evidence and cross-examination . of
Miss Erline Pyattin the Police Court.-
The evidence of the young lady showed
that she was with her father on a How
ard street car on the evening of October
n last, and that a man stood in front of
her on the dummy of the car. This man
was Identified by the witness as beinjr
Buckley. Miss Pyatt. also asserted that
he was the man who jumped from the car
at Howard and -Twentieth streets, where
Rice was being clubbed by another 1 man.
Important Evidence Produced.
: , The trial of William Buckley, the ma
chinist, who with Thomas Moran, Charles
Donnelly and Edward Duncan ' stands ac
cused of ' having murdered. George W.
Rice,' a non-union machinist, by shooting
him on the night ~of October 11 last at
Howard and Twentieth" streets; was re-'
sumed yesterday morning before Superior-
Judge Lawlor and a jury.
Ther hearing of evidence in the case had
been postponed for some days on account
of the absence from; the city of Walter
Pyatt and his daughter, Erline Pyatt,. im
portant witnesses for the prosecution. Â¦" .'
Pyatt arrived . from the City of Mexico
on Sunday last, and when he appeared in
court yesterday he announced that his
daughter was ill in. the City of
and; -was unable to be present at the trial.
Pyatt testified that he was on a Howard
street car on ihe evening of October 11
andahat he saw Buckley jump from thy
car ' and . shoot Rice, who was being
clubbed by another -man. The cross-ex
amination by the defense failed to shake
the evidence of the -witness. 'â¢- ,Â¦-
Police Otlicer Brown testified that when
he placed Buckley under arrest the pris
oner had a scar on the side of his face.
This evidence was most important,- as it
was a strong point in the identification of
liuckley by Mr. Pyatt's daughter. Â¦
,.: There was a legal battle between the at
torneys for the prosecution and the de
fense when it was sought to introduce the
transcript of the evidence given by Miss
