of the Authors' Club in Salt Lake City,

THEMES FOR DEBATE;
To-day before the board she acknowl
edged her error, and Mrs. McMahon, in
stead of pushing her claims as the col
cred woman did at. Milwaukee under the
same circumstances even though a West
ern member/ of the board demanded she
be admitted, she withdrew amicably on
two. conditions. Onc^ was that the mem
bership committee shoulder the mistake
and she be seated In the convention, not
withstanding a vote was denied her.
' The opening day was distinguished by
two secref events which might have de
veloped Into sensations had they reached
the convention.. One which got as far as
the board of directors had to do with the
."turning down" of a delegate, from a se
cret society. The other, which concerned
the possible unseating of Mrs. Roberts "of
Salt Lake City, wife of the former Con
gressman from. Utah, in the event, that
she shoufd try tc appear as a delegate,
( was squelched in Its native State. i '
- Tiic ; first affair. ' which affects a na
tional â¢ < organization of 8000 members,
came up before the board of directors iii
the morning at its secret session. Mrs
C. H. .McMahon of Salt Lake City. -It
seems, had been appointed delegate from
the P. E. O. Chapter In that city, which
had applied for admission to the General
Federation, and she had received her cre
dentials. But at the 7 last minuta ' Mrs!
Denison. as member of the membership
committee, discovered that secret socle
ties were not admissible, and so notified
the delegate. .
"But let us not forget that a great re

The Chicago is expected to leave Venice
immediately. She will proceed to Nar!e. - .
where she will remain until the arrival of
the Illinois. Rear Admiral Crownlnshleld
is expected to organize a court to investi
gate the conduct of the officers and men
and if they are to blame, a court-martial
will be ordered: The effect of the action
of the Italian authorities will probably be
to cause American men-of-war to avoid
Italian ports for some time to come.
Embassador von Maypr des Planches, the
Italian representative in Washington, call
ed upon Secretary Hay this morning and
explained to him that it was a serious of
fense to resist .arrest in Italy; that the
officers should have submitted and they
could have made explanations to the po
lice authorities. He Intimated that hU
Government would order their release.
While this action is satisfactory to the
Government, a feeling of irritation has
been created by the incident, which may
ultimately have some importance. The
impression i3 growing in official circles
that the summary imprisonment of the
Chicago's sailors was due to the feeling
which exists in Italy against the United
States on account of the lynching here of
Italian subjects, and the failure of the
authorities to punish the murderers. It
is said that if the sailors of any other na
tion had been in the position of those of
the United States they would undoubtedly
have been returned to their ships to suf
fer punishment in accordance with tho
â¢ regulations * of- their service* .

general stated that Aguinaldo and the!
Filipino people were justified in "conclud

army were sympathetic. The . Filipinos,
he said, were in a resentful and vindictive
opposition to Spain and any- active force
on their part against Spaln ; naturally
helped the United 1 States and vice iversa;
but, he said, there was a. distinct purpose
through the intercourse /between the
Americans and the Filipinos to repudiate
the idea of direct co-operation,". which in
a way committed: the United States:to a
policy. General Merritt, he said, was un
der the strictest- orders not to commit
the Government, but Aguinaldo "was anx
ious to make an artificial record ; which
would oblige General Merritt" to do some
thing he did not want to do. Â¦'.?.

The most significant? feature; of the or
ganization of the court by order of the
President is that it shows that Roosevelt
proposes to hold to his policy of review
ing every court-martial case. It is in
sisted that, this shows no lack of confi
dence in Major General Chaffee, but as
Major General Chaff oft is tho responsible
head of affairs in tho islands it would
not be proper to permit proceedings to
begin and end with him. The President
at first intended that Major Glenn should
be/ tried at San Francisco, but as most
of the witnesses, soldiers and natives can
be easily, assembled in Samar it was
dcenied advisable to direct the court- to

REDDING, May 1.â The little commun
ity of Lake City in Modoc County, not far
from Cedarville, Is wrought up over the
presence of a "wild man" who ia really
a lunatic from one of the State asylums.
He has returned to bis old home and be
fore lapsing? again into utter Insanity
stated that he had come back to kill the
man who has married the wife who onco
was his and who is now foster father to
his two children. The madman has black
ened his face, hides in the thickets anil
approaches the settlement like a wild ani
mal. He has already spread terror.
About eight years ago a farmer named
Wright T?aa arrested for insanity and
committed to an asylum. He was dis
charged as cured after a year and re
turned to his home. â¢ Again he became de
mented and was sent agatn to the 'asy
lum. His- wife after a time secured a d!
vorce and married J. F. Cole, who farms
near Lake 'City. Two weeks ago Wright
appeared suddenly in Cedarvjlle, made a
threat against Cole's life and disappeared.
Several days later the children at the Sol
dier Creek School were terribly fright
ened by a half-clad man who ran up to
the school yard fence and made grim
aces at them.

Harriman has the reputation of being
the hardest man to see in New York.
He will sometimes send for a score of his
brightest railroad men to hold a confer
ence at a certain, hour. They will ar
rive, one by one, and possibly wait hours
and then go away without seeing him
When he is considering one subject he
will not. brook being disturbed, and re
mains closeted in his private room often
eight hours at a time.
H. E. Huntington followed closo on
Mr. Mackay'g heels. He also had to
wait fully an. hour before he could see
Harriman, and so it went on- all t'ay.
President Horace G. Burt of the Union
Pacific called . in the afternoon. He
counted every spot on the carpet of the
anteroom before President Harriman
finally saw him.

was sent back that the little wizard of

hands of the clock went round and, as
the story goes, Mackay showed his impa

around the Â¦ building that he remarked
that "he was not in the habit of waiting
for anybody." Anyhow, he decided to

The Rose Fete, held in the pavilion, was
a very popular feature of the entertain
ment. The display of choice garden and
field flowers has seldom been excelled.
The exhibition was divided into sections,
each under the supervision of one of the
civic or religious organizations of the
town. The result was a good-natured
rivalry, which, manifested itself in an un
'usually attractive display. No, admission
was charged to the pavilion and the place
was thronged all forenoon with admiring
visitors.
A ball was held at the pavilion in the
evening and many of the guests stayed
over to attend. The committee on prizes
made the following awards: Float, A. O:

period assigned for lunch. After a selec
tion by the band, James H. Lyndon, presi

D. C. Clark, Mayor- elect of Santa Cruz.
Clark delivered an address upon the
origin, achievements and aims ot the or
der. His oration was attentively listened
to and was marked with frequent ap
plause.
Immediately after the oration a competi
tive drill, participated in by San Jose
Company No. 8 and Liberty No. 11 of Oak
land, was held. Captain Van Sant of San
Jose led hia men upon the field first, and
though they have had an inadequate opr
portunity to drill together, they made a
very creditable showing. Liberty Com
pany No. 11 was greeted with applause as
it marched forth with a formation that
would have done credit to veterans. Cap
tain J. A. Cavasso put his men through
many difficult evolutions and there was
scarcely a flaw in their execution. At the
conclusion of the contest Liberty Com
pany was awarded the first prize and
San Jose Company was awarded the sec
ond prize. San Jose Company also car
ried off a prize for having/the largest per

with four-legged guests, he Is permitted
to- play tag and hide and seek in his

Upon the return of the Goodwins to

Senator McLaurin, Senator Money's
colleague, who, with Attorney Bell, rep
resented Money, explained tnat Money
had been confined to his room since Sat
urday â¢ and was threatened * with pneu
monia. McLaurin thought It was "un
necessary to stats the cause of the trou
ble." He produced a physician's certi
ficate dated yesterday, addressed to
Â¦whom it may concern, setting forth that
Senator Money was suffering from con
gestion of the lungs and confined to his
loom and bed, and it would be tlve or six
days before he could leave his house.
All he wanted, said McLaurin, was to re
lieve Senator Money from further prose
cution In this case for any alleged of
fenses charged against him.
The court stated that the only point
was as to power of the District Attorney
to nolle pros., which he was inclined to
sustain, but he finally agreed to postpone
announcing his conclusion until Tuesday
morning.
WASHINGTON. May 1.â An unexpect
ed move to nolle pros, the three cases
of alleged assault growmg out of the al
tercation en a street car last week, in
which Senator Money of Mississippi, Con
ductor Orpha W. Shaner and Truck
Foreman James E. Hooper of the Dis
trict Fire Department figured, resulted
to-day in postponing the cases in the Po
lice Court" until Tuesday. After a pro
tracted conference between counsel for
Senator Money in District Attorney
Mullowney's office it was decided- by
them to allow the cases to drop, and
when they appeared In the Police Court
later Mullowney announced to Judge
Klmball /that after investigating the
cases on both sides he had concluded
that the ends of justice would be sub
served by dismissing the charges against
all three defendants. He would, there
fore, nolle pros. them. The attorneys
l'or Shaner and Hooper protested against
this action.
After receipt of Carter's telegram I framed
a reply, setting forth the conclusions of the
executive committee, but before sending the
message made efforts to get the views of every
director in the city. Up to this hour over fifty
of : them have been consulted, and without an
exception every one favored a postponement.
I have; therefore, -replied to President Carter of
the National Commission to that effect and
have asked that our conclusions be submitted
to Congress and to the President. Â¦ I think
there Is no doubt as to the action Congress
will take, and that It will be In favor of post
ponement. An additional year for preparation
will enable us to hold such an exposition as
will be worthy of the great event we propose to
celebrate. It will be truly International in
character and ,wlll. in my Judgment be par.
ticipated in by every civilized country on ths
globe. We have no more time than will be
needed in which to make required preparations
for the proper accommodation of the thousands
of visitors who will be witRln our gates Our
streets and boulevards should be improved the

The sundry civil bill, which passed . the
House several weeks ago and is now going
through the Sanate, contains an appropriation
of $1, 018,000 to Â¦ provide for ' a . Government ex
hibit, a special Indian exhibit ? and Â¦ the addi
tional cost of the Government " building- at the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition. -It was deemed
advisable to have the date of the fair definite
ly fixed in that bill, in :the event any change
from 1003 should, be decided upon. . For many
months past the. fair has virtually been post
poned for one year: A decided ' majority of the
directors prefer 1004. and have for six months
or more. The repeated requests of both domes
tic and foreign â¢ exhibitors for postponement;
advices from foreign governments to the ef
fect that they had not sufficient time in which
to make, preparation for a representative dis
play -in- 1903; the statement of Governor Taft
that the Philippines would not be able to In
stall their exhibits in a creditable manner if
the exposition should not.be postponed to 1904;
the expressed fear of the Government archi
tect that he could not procure material for a
Government building by 1903," and the fact that
the general public - have for months past con
sidered postponement a .," foregone conclusion,
were some of the reasons that moved the
executive committee to authorize me to In
form the National Commission that any action
of Congress changing the time of the exposition
from 1903 to 1004 would be acceptable. The
telegram from. President Carter of the National
Commission was received at 3:30 this afternoon.
Senator Cockrell wired us this afternoon that
the sundry civil bill would pass the Senate on
Saturday, and if a change of date was to be
incorporated therein Congress should be Im
mediately advised of the wishes of the local
corporation. There was not sufficient time in
; which to call a; meeting. of the board of direc
tors to take action on the subject," consequently
the executive committee authorized me to ex
press the,ir wishes to the effect that a postpone
ment should be ordained by Congress.

"The purpose was to promoteour gen
eral corporate interests. The company
never has directly or indirectly purchased
any sugar lands except in Porto :,- Rico.
We' did- have such a purpose there for a
time, but abandoned it." â¢ . ; ' ;
In reply tg' a question concerning*. the
supposititious condition of poverty of Â¦â¢ the
Cuban planters and of the sugar produc
ers generally, Havemeyer said ' he ' knew
something of theni, for. he said, "I hap
pen to.be in that, category myself.". .
He said he had not advanced any
money to the sugar planters, but he sup
posed that some advances had been-made
to them by local banks and that no doubt
advances also had been made by Ameri
can brokers. While on this point he^aid
he made his purchases through -'Cuban
brokers, but that so far as he knew none
of them was a sugar owner. He added
that he would not- deal with brokers who
had sugar of their own to; sell. â¢
Speaking-of other sugar interests In the
United States," Havemeyer said he had
no understanding with the other refiner
ies except the Spreckels' plant in Califor
nia, which he held in joint- ownership
with Mr. Spreckels. All other refineries
were independent of the trust; The ca- .
pacity of the Spreckels refinery he placed'
at 500,000 pounds a day. j
\ .
"What, then." asked the Senator, "was
the purpose of your company in this in
stance?" .
Here Senator Platt concluded his ques
tions and Senator Teller took the witness,
bringing out the fact that tho capital
stock of the trust had been increased In
recent years from $75,000,000 to $90,000,000.
"Are you aware." asked Teller, "that
at the- time your company made this in
crease of $15,000,000 the. newspapers stated
that the increase had been made 'for the
purpose of purchasing sugar lands in
Cuba?"
The witness replied that. he did not re
call the fact. .
to questions pertaining to these interests.
"If," he said, "the committee compels
me to give information, I can, of course,
do so, but I do jnot see what my private
interests have Co do wfth this inquiry."
ST. PETERSBURG, May 1.â The seri

is apparent from the fact that Dragomir

vice director of the. Department of Police;

have especially suffered from the out
break, during which the Duke of. Olden
burg's estate was dismantled.
It now develops that the agitators who
are chiefly responsible for the spread of
the revolutionary movement i among the
hungry peasants used a curious political
canard to bring the former serfs and the
landowners into collision. A rumor was
SITUATION IS SERIOUS.
5T. PETERSBURG, Tuesday, April
29.â Duke Alexander of Olden
burg's celebrated chateau ' of
Romone. in the Government of
Voronek, Southern. Russia, has
been burned by revolting peasants, who
practically ruined the estate. â¢ The Duke
is the father-in-law of the Czar's sister
(..isa, who married his eon, Duke Peter,
last year.
COPENHAGEN, May 1.â A dispatch to
the Pohtlken of this city from Russia
(filed on the German frontier) announces
that the labor population of the whole
district between Moscow and Vladimir.
Central Russia, is in revolt. There have
been numerous encounters Between the
workingmen and the troops and many
persons have been killed or wounded.
A Uhlan regiment commanded by Colo
nel Mcrozeff refused . to act against the
workmen.
In reply to another series of questions,
Havemeyer said that his company, as
such, holds no sugar lands In Cuba, but
he added that he had himself made some
purchases there, but that he did not con
sider it legitimate to compel him to reply
HOLDS NO SUGAR LANDS.
"We could not 'oblige* any reduction.
In case of a concession to Cuban sugar
the price might be lowered, say one-slx
icenth of a cent a pound, but that would
be nothing as compared to the reduction
in the tariff rate which would amount to
about a third of a cent a pound. Even
so great a reduction as I have mentioned
would depend on the necessity for mar
keting, and if there should be any pres
sure on that account the necessity would
be that of the producers and would not
be ours."
"It has been stated repeatedly that If
this concession is made the sugar trust
will be in a position to oblige producers
to make euch reductions that you will se
cure the entire benefit of the legislation.
Ik that true?"
"We are under contract for the entire
250,000 tons produced in Hawaii. There is
no tariff on that product, but the price
is not affected by that fact."
"How about the Hawaiian product?"
"In no way," was the reply. "Cuba
â¢would be under no obligations 'to sell to
us, because, as I have said, the Cuban
producers could find other markets."
"All the duty has been taken off Porto
Rico sugar, do you get that sugar, any
cheaper on that account?"
"Not at all."
"We have," he said, "no control over
them whatever; they don't belong to us."
"Cuba has to sell her sugar in this
market, hasn't she?"
"No, that is not true. She can sell in
i England, for instance. If she is desirous
.to do so. England could take the entire
Cuban crop."
Platt then asked:
; "Suppose the United States should make
a concession of say 25 per cent In the
tariff rates on Cuban sugar, could not
you refuse to buy the Cuban product ex
cept at your own rates and thus secure
the benefit of the concession?"
Â« "on turning;- Havemeyer said the entire
Cuban sugar crop is about 750, (Kfc) tonp,
but that much of it has been withheld
ij-om the market, in view of the possible
tariff *yrtcpf>FionB to be made by Con
gress. On this account his purchases had.
been only about one-third the average of
other years. On this account, too, the
purchases had been made ""principally at
outports where the storage facilities were
poor, rather than at llaviftia. The pur
chases from the outports had caused most
of the shipments to be made from those
ports, rather than from Havana, where
the company now has about 45,000 tons
stored. The purchases at the outportd
had caused the sales there to be made
on a parity with the beet sugar prices.
Speaking of the capacity of his com
pany, he said that it refined 65 per cent
of the American refined product. He
aoded that the percentage of his com
pany's product compared to the entire
sugar consumption of the United States
â¢was about 50 per cent. Last year his
company produced 1.200,000 tons or the re
lined sugar, while the consumption was
2,400,000 tons.
Returning to the purchases of Cuban
sugar for the present year, Havemeyer
gave figures of purchases for other years
to show thfc relative volume of the cur
rent acquisitions, saying that in 1892 254,000
tons had been bought; in 1893, 246.000 tons;
in 1894, 321,000 tons.
HOW PRICE IS FIXED.
In reply to other questions he said that
the price of raw sugar in the United
States is fixed by the beet market prices
in Hamburg. The price there fixes the
selling price for the entire world, said he.
On the subject of the price of Cuban
sugars he said that his company could not
determine their price.
"That is the statement I make."
"So that you wish to be understood as
Faying that the amount you have men
tions as having purchased represents
your entire interest, direct and indirect,
lri Cuban *ugar?'
"Xo; we have bought all told 93,000 tons
of Cuban sugar during the present year,
or about three-fourths of a month's sup
piy, our consumption being about S5,wO
tons oer wt*>k."
"Do you control any sugar in Cuba
ether than that purchased?".
"None, whatever, in any manner."
"Have you taken any options on Cuban
sugars ?"
"1 have not."
"Have you made an advance on any
Cuban sugar?"
"None whatever."
"Does the 59,000 tons you mention rep
resent your entire purchases in Cuba
since the 1st of January?"
PURCHASES IN CUBA.
"Where do you buy your raw sugar?"
"All over the worldâ in Cuba, Java,
Hamburg, Trieste, the British iVest In-
UicF, South America, wherever sugar is
grown."
"Will you," said Senator Platt. "tell the
committee how much Cuban sugar, if
any. has been purchased, and if now held
by your company?"
"Since early in February last we have
purchased 50,000 tons, or 256,000 bags, or
about ten days' supply," replied the wit
ness. "Of that quantity, 26,000 tons in
now in process of shipment from Cuba. '
The prices paid had, he said, ranged
from SI 75 to $1 S3, the higher prices oe
iiig paid on March 13 and the lower on
Aorii 22.
Replying to questions by Senator Platt.
Havemeyer said his company was gen
erally known as the sugar trust and that
its refineries are located as' follows: In
Xew Jersey, one; New York, three; Mas
sachusetts, two; Philadelphia, two; New
Orleans, one.

Kane performed well in the box, but
was a trifle wild at critical moments.
Toman, the little Cupid of the Angels,
did some great hot fooi stunts. Ander
son handled Waddoll s terrific delivery in
clever fashion. Delmas did some long
distance reaching out In center and Kane
took the crowd by surprise when he ac
tually dropped a single in back of third
base, the list hit of the game. "
Lawler did not play, as he is weak
when facing a left-handed pitcher, so Del
mas looked after local interests in con
terfield. The game lacked interest until
the last round, when the Ponies seemed
to have a slim chance. The crowd was
a record-breaker for Thursday, the
stands and bleeehers being well filled.
The score;
The Ponies made a sort of a do or die
rally in the final wind-up. Waddell
seemed to let down and walked Kane.
McHale shot a grounder toward Hanion,
who fumbled, and both men were safe,
Kane going to third. McHale made sec
ond on a passed ball, while Nordyke, the
pride of tne Ponies, swatted three times
at the vacant space. Holly placed a
pretty dri%-e over second, and the only
local runs -were recorded by McHale and
Kane.
The Angeis made tneir three runs in
the fourtn. sixth and eighth. A few
well placed hits and two wild pitches by
Kane were ihe chief factors in bringing
about the scoring.
He delivered the ball with terrific
speed and with perfect ease and grace.
At the same time his control was mar
velous; he walked but one man, and that
happened in the final mix-up. His revenge
is certainly complete, for he made tne
Ponies Iook cheap, simply toying with
them throughout me game.
For eight long innings not a single
Pony had a chance to venture past the
second stopping-place, and but two
lonely, scattering hits were made oft",
Rube's puzzling offerings. Ten of the
local artists pt-rishea by the striKe-out
process. \> aadel! was lorced to lurnisn

nimself.
He loomed up in the pitcher's box yes
terday afternoon at Recreation Park as
l)1g as a white elephant and looked as
fresh as the May daisies. He threw the
elusive sphere over the plate so easy and
so fast it resembled a cross between a
balloon and a bullet from a Krupp gun.

paw and rdol of southern climes, has ac
complished his second triumph.

capital of Bengal. In 1800 it had a popu
lation of 200,000 and was noted for its
product of fine muslins, whlchywere
known as "woven wind." Growing Im

industries, however, and by 1891 the popu
lation had dwindled to 82,000.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
, CHICAGO. May 1.â Many of the points
in allegations upon which United States
District Attorney Bethea will base his ap
plication for an injunction to restrain the
greed of the beef trust were learned to
day from 'an authoritative source. They
are as follows:
"That a combination has existed among
big packers to raise and lower prices of
meats to retailers and consumers, irre
spective of the natural market conditions,
this combination forming under the stat
utes of the Government a trust.
"That the packers have had among
themselves a profit-sharing and expense
sharing organization not formed by incor
poration, but partaking of all the features
of a trust according to the statutes.
"That by secret verbal and written
agreement the big packers have re
strained the wholesale and retail meat
trade; have. discriminated between pat
rons; have "bulled" and Pbeared" mar
kets for personal gain and irrespective of
the statutes provided.
"That, in combination the big packers
have forced and accepted discriminating
rates from railways of the country, to the
injury of similar interests not In the com
bination. :
"That the so-called 'credit agreement'
is no more- nor less than a trust agree
ment to control the meat market of New
York and other large cities. Â«
"That the territory is divided among
the big packers for stock buying and
meat selling purposes, and that trade is
not only restrained, but competition de
stroyed.
"That all of these acts are offensive to
the internal commerce of the United
States, an oppression upon the people
and a violation of law." :
It is said that the names of members
of big packing firms Â»will appear In ths
bill in connection with those of a number
of important subordinates. - . ;
Federal Grand Jury proceedings ; will
grow out of this bill and indictments will
supplement the Government's demand for
a permanent Injunction against the big
packers. ; .
It is expected that the long looked for
bill when filed will contain a definition
of scope of the alleged combination, and
that this definition will be of this,char
acter: - . '
"Conferring upon an arbitrator mutually
selected the right to examine all books,
papers and accounts of trust branches.
' "To impose a fine of i not more than $50
for every violation of the agreement dis-,
covered.
"To impose a fine of not more than $50
upon any employe who disclosed business
secrets. v
"To make. a decision from which there
was no appeal, when members of the com
bination disagreed as to the disposition
to be made of a delinquent butcher.
"To- place on the blacklist dealers who
did not accept : the rule of paying their
bills by Tuesday following purchases.
"To place on the blacklist dealers whose
checks were not mailed later than the
day following the receipt of a bill. . i
"To collect from the fines imoosed all
the expenses of the arbitrator's office."
BERLIN, May 1.â "American energy^
and American millions are making them
selves felt in China more and more pow
erfully,"' said Count von Waldersee in an
interview at Dresden, where he Is visit
ing the King of Saxony. The Count was
commander-in-chief of the allied forces
in China. Continuing, he said:
"We have come into closer political
touch with the United States and that
country will exercise a favorable Influ
ence In the world's politics.
"The English-Japanese alliance Is of
pre-eminent significance," he said. "It re
veals the seriousness of tffe world situa
tion. In Japan, which I visited after leav
ing China, a collision with Russia is re
garded as unavoidable. The Japanese
troops which I saw are excellently trained.
Several of the Russian positions in East
Asia seem still to be exposed, but this
will not be for long, ' because Russia is
making the best use of her time. Her
position at "sea Is daily growing stronger
and great interests are at stake in China.
"From all sides, Burmah, Tonkin and
other places, energy is being directed
toward the Yangtse Valley, which, be
cause of Its position and wealth, Is the
most important part of China."

A very intelligent rendering of a dra

the Lake" was given last night by the
students and alumni of Cogswell Poly
technic College at Twenty-sixth and Fol
som streets to a large and appreciative
audience.
Though much shortened, the story is
well sustained from the time Fitz-James,
James V- of Scotland, first meets the fair
Ellen Douglas, to the final scene in the
audience chamber at Stirling Castle.
The actors and actresses had been well
grounded in their parts and did great
credit to the schooling. of Miss Jenne M.

produced. . .â¢ . - â¢â¢ .
â¢In the first act both. Miss Madeline M.
Murphy, who essayed the . part' of Ellen

both warmed to their parts as the even
ing went on and threw . aside all ama
teurism. : .

upon Roderick at his campflre and is ex
tended by the chieftain the courtesy of
his rugged fastness, Mr. Simpson's intel

plause.
Miss Ceiia A. Brietstcln, as Blanche of
Devon, the crazed and captive Lowland
maid, held the audience from her en
trance to her death by the hand of Mur

a well-merited curtain call. The other
parts were well sustained and the whole
a most creditable performance. The cast

Between the second and third acts Miss
Elsie J. Burrlngrton sang, "Mary of Ar
gyle," and as an encore "Comln' Thro'
the Rye." "When Te Gang Awa', Ja

tween the third and fourth acts, and
little Miss Mary Murphy came in for
much applause for her dancing of the
Highland fling at the end of the fouth
act.
The stage setting: and dressing of the
play showed that much care had been
taken to produce as near as possible the
scenery where the plot is laid, and the
costumes of. the period.

Â¦ Mrs. Craigle, Dr. Conan Doyle, Anthony
Hope and J. M. Barrie have all, rather
oddly, written two original plays, two

recalls the fact that the King takes a
very keen interest In his books. He has

wonders if .any future historian will, like

quite as well as the doctor.

given the artist, George W. Eve, permis

the coronation fund to the London hos

GOSSIP FROM
LONDON WORLD
OF LETTERS
We have recently directed attention to' the state
ment of President Ripley of the Santa Fe that his
road would probably decline to comply with the
ruling of the commission on the Los Angeles citrus
fruit cases, and that of President Hill of the Great
Northern 'Securities Company that a decision of the
Supreme v Court against the recent merger of compet
ing railroads would not have any effect on the situa
tion whatever, and to the report of the commission
that neither itself nor the courts have been able to
enforce, the present law. Such being, the situation,
it is 'clearly the duty of Congress to act, but of course
Congress is not going to act unless the shippers of
die country demand it. So long as the Yailroads can
keep the people divided, just so long can' they keep
Congress-quiet and the commission and the courts
powerless.
Mr. Knapp, chairman of the commission, has re
peatedly declared that with a few amendments,
which have been stated in the reports of the com
mission, the present law could be made effective.
Nothing in the way of radical revolution is therefore
required. About^the Only change in the law would
be a provision by 'which the law can be enforced.
All that is needed is to give it vigor. It is not too
much to ask Congress to grant that, even at this late
day in the session, and a petition for it should be
sent , to Washington from . j representative men of
every city in the Union. '< "<Â¦'.
It would be well for merchants, manufacturers and
other large shippers of the country to unite in a
concerted movement to bring pressure to bear upon
Congress in favor of the measure. Â¦' At the present
time the shippers of Chicago are acting, and after a
time those of another city will act; but they do not
act together, and the railways have learned how to
play one-.against another. The consequence is the
railroad officials are" able to laugh at the Interstate
Commerce Commission, ignore the decisions of the
courts and pay no attention to the public."
WHILE there is little "prospect that the bill
clothing the Interstate Commerce. Com
mission with the. enlarged' powers it asks for
will be passed at this session, it is gratifying to
know that the advocates of the measure have not
abandoned'the fight and are still; insistently urging
the matter upon the attention of Congress.
Two other measures of importance have been fairly
well advanced. The bill for the promotion of the
American merchant marine has passed the Senate,
and the isthmian canal bill has passed the House. If
now these two measures can be' added to the list of
things accomplished during the session this . Con
gress will have no occasion for distrust of the popu
lar vote when its members go before their, con
stituencies to submit their work and ask the ap
proval of the people.
In addition to other important legislation the war
taxes have been repealed and a burden of about
$-0,000,000 has been lifted from industry and com
merce: Thus all the special taxes called for by the
Spanish war have been removed and the revenues of
the country once more put upon a peace basis. The
Chinese exclusion bill, out of which some Democrats
hoped to make special capital for themselves, has been
duly enacted. The Philippine tariff has been adjusted
satisfactorily, and appropriations for internal im
provements have been made upon a scale that shows
the interest the Republican party has always taken in
the advancement of the nation. .
' As a whole the work of- the session thus far has
been highly creditable to the majority. The watch
ful Democrats have rot been able to score a single
point upon which they can appeal to the country,
while, on the other hand, the Republicans have al
ready accomplished much to which platform-makers
can "point with pride," and upon which candidates
can with justice claim the support of the people.
The session is not yet at an end, and possibly there
may be a Republican blunder before the end comes,
but at this time there is no sign of such a thing. The
one folly committed by the leaders of the party was
that of advocating the Cuban reciprocity scheme, but
there is now a fair prospect that even that blunder
will be, rendered harmless by the defeat of the bill.
WHEN the present session of Congress be
gan it was given out that the*Democratic
leaders intended to make use of it to develop
policies upon which to appeal to the country in the
elections for Congressmen this fall. There were
high expectations in the Democratic camp that the
Republicans would blunder in dealing with the Phil
ippines or some other new issue of th,e time, and they
were loud in their predictions that before the session
ended they would have ammunition enough to make
an aggressive campaign in every district in the
country.

This fall a Legislature is to be elected, and if the
Native Sons be in genuine earnest about the matter
of protecting the woods and waters they can see to
it that every candidate for a legislative office is
pledged to give support to some well devised meas
ure looking to that end. California will to some ex
tent of course take the risks of an experimenter in the
line of forest conservation, for her woods and the
conditions under which they flourish are different
from those of any other country; but still in what
has been done elsewhere there are abundant guides to
help to the solution of ' every problem we will be
called upon to confront. Many of the nations of the
Old World have preserved their forests. Several of
the States have begun forest preservation or replant
ing in this country- ' We can learn something of
value from each of them. The main thing is to make
up our minds to 7 undertake the work, and in the
campaign of education to that end the Native Sons
ought to be among the most earnest workers and
teachers.
Far more destructive than the lumbermen are the
annual fires that sweep the fields and the woods. The
losses occasioned by these fires far exceed what would
be the cost of maintaining an efficient patrol to guard
against them. No satisfactory estimate has ever
been made of the total direct and-4ndirect losses from
the fires of even a single season, but it is known that
the amount is very large and that every section of the
State is affected by it As a matter of present econ
omy, therefore, as well as a precaution against the
impending dangers' of the future, we should adopt
some comprehensive and scientific system of pro
tecting our forests from destructive fires and conserv
ing them from wasteful methods of lumbering.
Of the three branches of the work that of conserv
ing the forests is of primary importance. All over
the East the great native forests have been well nigh
destroyed, and lumbermen are now turning their at
tention to California. Even as it is the destruction of
the California woods is going on with a startling
rapidity, so that when the East begins to send still
further numbers of lumbermen to cut away the larger
trees and recklessly waste the smaller ones the annual
destruction will be sufficient in a few years to bring
us face to face with the problem that is now confront
ing the East itselfâ that of replanting at a high cost
the forests that should have been conserved from the
start.
We are wasting our forests year by year. We are
permitting our waters to run idly to the sea in many
localities where they should be carefully conserved,
and we have been halting and hesitating in the de
velopment of irrigation, notwithstanding the fact that
all experience has shewn that when properly man
aged the profits derived from it are enormous.
BY the action of the Grand Tarlor of the Native
Sons in adopting resolutions in favor of pro
tecting the forests, conserving the^waters and
increasing the irrigation facilities of the State, and
the appointment of a committee to take the matter
in charge, another important ally has been added to
the forces that have been long working in that direc
tion and carrying on a campaign of education upon
the subject. The issue is one with which the Native
Sons may well concern themselves, for it affects the
prosperity of California more potently than any
other of the time.

PRESIDENT ITARRIMAN'S address at the merchants' banquet was for Califor
nians at least the most notable of his utterances since the Southern Pacific Rail
road passed under his control. It covered many points of interest to the people,
but-ignored others on which a clear declaration of policy should have been made.
As a whole, however, the speech will make a favorable impression upon the public. It re
veals the fact that under the new management an extensive system of improvements, in
everything from the roadbed to equipments has been undertaken . and will be steadfastly
carried on until the lines of the company will afford out shippers far better facilities for
transportation than they have ever before enjoyed.
It was to the improvements now being made in the line that President Harriman
devoted most of his speech. The company is making rapid, progress in shortening the
line, lessening heavy grades and reducing excessive curvatures. So well has that work
been carried on that the President was able to say with a just pride: "In about two years
and a half from the time we began, we reduced the grades on the Union Pacific from a
maximum of about 90 per/ cent to a maximum of 43:3 per cent. We also eliminated
curvature and reduced it from a maximum of 10 per cent to 4 per cent,, having in only
one instance a curvature of 6 per cent for a short curve."
That is an excellent showing for progressive management/ It affords a striking
illustration of the promptness witji which the new industrial leaders of America are setting
aside old forms for new whenever there is anything to be gained by the change. In re
ducing grades and curves Mr. Hzfrriman says the conipany constructed 158 miles of new
road and abandoned 188 miles of old roads with which the country , was well satisfied
fifteen years ago. The abandoned mileage represents a loss of aboutv $5,000,000 and the
new lines a cost of $7,000,000. Probably no railroad men in the world outside of the
United States would have the nerve to make such changes, and it is just, for that reason
our railways are the marvel of other nations. The fact is worthy of the consideration ot
those who are inclined to favor governmental control of railways. How long would it
have been before a Government could have been induced to make such changes?
Upon the. increase in the equipment of the roads in the way of rolling stock of all
kinds Mr. Harriman was able to make an equally good showing, but there is a suggestion
of a possible disappointment for San Francisco in what he said about improving the ter
minal facilities of his road. On that point he said:
When these improvements of the lines are finished (and they will be finished only with the work
which I have explained to you which has been begun this year, but will have to be continued for sev
eral years, and wili extend much further than the matters which I have been talking. about, as we.
have got to get a hole through the Sierra Neyadas, and I don't know just where we will go through
â but that will be improvement of the eastern end of the line to dispose of some of the Eastern
traffic, which we hope to bring this way), we will have to have additional terminal facilities. We
will have to have them here. We are now about to apply for some rights in San Francisco to take
care of the lines we are improving south of here and the coast line, and you know something about
the bay shore, and we do hot want to be delayed. Every day that delays us from getting some other
terminal improvements pending is lost. We do not want to resort to questionable methods, in order
to obtain those facilities. We want to be open and above board and have the public help us to help
themselves. â¢, â
It would appear from that statement that the Southern Pacific Company is about
to "apply for some rights" in San Francisco at once for the purpose of providing im
proved terminal facilities, but that the improvements will not be made" until the work on
the roadbed is finished, and that work will occupy several years. If that be the meaning
of the statement we shall have to wait until the coming of another new era before we -get
the much-desired new passenger depot and other terminal improvements.
There is an ominous ring in the statement "We do not want to resort to question
able methods in order to obtain those facilities."" Mr. Harriman v should have said "We
will not resort to questionable methods." There is no reason wjiy, he should. The Call
has no hesitation in assuring Mr. Harriman that if he will dismiss the gang of political
bosses who have been suggesting to him that questionable methods will be needed and
that their services will be required by the road, he will greatly improve the prospect of
promptly obtaining the terminal privileges he desires. Mr. Harriman has^only to study the
political history of San , Francisco in recent years to learn that the questionable; politicians
who have been hanging like horse leeches upon'the Southern Pacific. Company 1 are utterly
discredited in the community, and if they be retained are certain' to hurf* Him morÂ§ than
they help him. ' *' .- >' w W- '^';V : ; "' 'Â¦Â¦'/Â¦
The people of San Francisco have no antagonism to the Southern Pacific Conix
pany. On the contrary they know the' welfare of their city is dependent upon the good
will of the company. They have no hostility toward the new management. They are
willing to meet Mr. Harriman more than half-way in his desire to improve the terminal
facilities of his road. They ask of him only fair dealing in business and a total avoidance of
corrupt politics. President Wheeler spoke the sentiment of all when he said:
This State needs the railway and the railway needs the State. There is nothing gained by fight
ing. The great waste comes from failure to co-operate. Let us not for a moment conceive that we
gain when there is a fight going on between the people and the railroads. The people are ready now
to co-operate, are ready to pull with those who pull, not to kick with those who kick. The motto /
\ for us is to join with those who are trying to do something, the lesson of the helping hand. /

' ;"Unless the Directors use more judg
ment in the apportionment of moneys al
lotted the School Department Is certainly
staring financial ruin in the face. .Proper
school buildings will cost on an average
$140,000 each, and fifteen buildings would
cost $2,100,000. The furnishings would cost
about $750,000, making in all $2,850,000. This
amount cannot be raised except by bond
ing the city for this purpose/'
Replying to an assertion made by School
Director Mark that the' State law governs
the School Department levy, Auditor
Baehr said yesterday that ir such were
the case the department would be enti
tled to $1,265,670, or $104,330 short of the
amount which It will ' receive under
Baehr's estimate. The State*- law allows
$35 for each pupil in average dany attend
ance in the schools, and there were 36,162
such pupils last year. Baehr says that if
the State law is paramount to the char
ter there will be a repetition of the short
age which existed In 1898, when there was
a deficit of $300,000. . through the fault of
the State law. Auditor Baehr continues:

Mayday was most beflttingly observed
yesterday at Schuetzen Park, near San
Rafael, by the Catholic Ladies' Aid So
ciety and their friends. A large crowd
from this city crossed the bay in the
morning, but occasional showers of rain
deterred them from being out of doors
much. In the afternoon, however, the sun
shone and a large delegation arrived from
San Rafael and Other places. There were
fully 2000 people present. Dancing was
the chief amusement during the morning,
while in the afternoon games, races and
other outdoor sports occupied the time
of those athletically inclined.
The summary of the races and winners
are as follows:
First race, one-sixteenth of a mile, boys un

and the dance was done in good old Irish
style to the music of the fiddle. The aft
ernoon was spent by the young people in
dancing in the large dance hall that !s

connected with engines at Companies No.

tury spent as a fireman is decidedly hard
on the constitution and this may account
for a derangement or a sluggish condi-

me for some time. It struck me while
reading advertisements about Doan's
Kidney Pills If they performed half what
they promised they might help me. and I-
went to the Owl Drug Co., 1126 Market

edy I required. Since the treatment my
general health has been much better. I
am averse to public notoriety, but you

sented should be known to everybody."

Miss Hattie Bynum Accuses Bev.
James X. Kelley of < a
Felony.
A scandal in colored church circles de
veloped yesterday when Miss. Hattie By
num, a pretty colored'glrl, 19 years of age,
living .with her . mother at 1310 Jackson
street/ swore to a complaint before Judge
Cabanlss charging Rev. James H. Kelley,
pastor of the Third Colored Baptist
Church, at Powell and Bush streets, with
betrayal under, promise of marriage.
- Rev. Mr. Kelley has been pastor of the
church for over three years and has the
largest congregation of any colored church
in the city. Prior to coming here he
preached In a church in Los Angeles. He
came to . Los Angeles from Alabama,
where, it is said, â¢ he has a wife and
family.
Rev.;' Mr. Kelley went to the Hall of
Justice about 9 o'clock last night and sur
rendered himself to the police. Previous
to this "Judge Cabanlss, who issued the
warrant for his arre3t, had fixed the bail
at $250 cash, and friends of the pastor at
once secured his release.
The complaining witness was in the
bond clerk's office when the minister was
being bailed out, and. expressed a willing
ness to compromise matters if a marriage
could be arranged between them. To this
the pastor indignantly refused to consent.
He said he had Ijttle to say about the
charge against him at present - further
than to state that it was entirely untrue
and unfounded. He said he had never
noticed any display of .affection - toward
himself on the part of the girl and could
not account for her accusation. . *

and Buckman after several days of lively
bidding in the court room of Department
9 of the Superior Court. When the land
was first offered for sale $300,000 was of
fered for it by a number of down town
business men. Attorney Garret W. McEn

as a result got an advance of $61,000 on

The Republican machine bosses are wel
come to all the joy they can derive from
the following statement signed by Eugene
E. Schmltz:
To set all gossip at rest I say:
I am not now a candidate for Governor or any
other office. I have at present not even In
mind a second term in the Mayor's chair. I
am going to do earnestly and as effectively
as possible, what my duty demands.
When a- new condition arises, whether It be
political or other; whether It be for a ten
dered nomination for Governor or the time
for considering a second candidacy for Mayor,
I -will be ready to meet It. Until then I do
not wish to be looked upon as laying wires for
any political nomination or as performing my
duties in the light of a personal political am
bition.
As I have said, I am not a candidate now
for any political office. The most extreme
declarations that I have offhand allowed myself
to make is that I believe it a good citizen's
duty to perform any public service he may be
called upon In any public station.
' I did say that if the people wanted me for
Governor I would consider it. But the proba
bility was so distant that I did not think it
was a matter of serious concern. .,Â¦:-"
i EÂ» E; SCHMITZ, Mayor.
The Mayor's style of dealing with the
gubernatorial question does not Infringe
on the Governor's patent. Gage, writing
as a Czar might address his subjects, said
to the Republicans assembled at San Jose;
"And you are well aware that I desire and
expect the people will accord me uie proud
distinction of. a renominatlon."
BEADY TO CABBY STANDAED.
The politicians and the voters who take
an interest in public affairs are convinced
that Mayor Schmitz would readily carry
the Republican standard in the next cam
paign if the convention should decide to
place it in his keeping. The Mayor is a
Republican. On the night of his election
to the office he now holds he said to The
Call:
"While my election Is a victory for the
Union Labor party, it Is also a great vic
tory for independent, anti-boss Repub
licans. I am a Republican and I regard
my election as a just and overwhelming
rebuke to bosslsm."
The Republican Primary League, which
has rendered so much service in the fight
against bosses, has no candidate for Gov
ernor, but the delegates supported by the
league will probably be Instructed to vote
for. Hon. Jacob H. Neff for chairman of
the convention. It is known that'Lieuten
ant Governor Neff will not take orders
from .'the bosses. He could not be per
suaded or forced to lend his aid to a ma
chine programme for excluding honestly
elected anti-boss delegations and seating
machine appointed delegates. Â¦-
SHADOW OF. COMING EVENTS.
The primary election for delegates will
not take place until August 12. Before
that time many , campaign events may
occur. It would not surprise the man
agers of Senator Perkins' campaign to
find Gage in the field as an aspirant for
the United States Senatorship. The lack
of enthusiasm for Gage at the San Jose
convention and the fact that the only
cheering for him came from the Sacra
mento contingent of office holders and
the water front boosters convinced the
party leaders of Gage's general unpopu
larity. . It is the common belief that party
defeat would be the outcome of his re
nomination. He is going on from bad to
worse. The mistake, to say the least, of
removing Dryden will turn a - thousand
voters against the Gage administration.
Politicians who are on the Inside expect

HIDEOUS DEED
OF A SUICIDE
Walks Into a Market
and Outs His Throat
With a Knife.
William Bartlett Closes a Dis
sipated Career With Re
volting Act.
Just before the suicide entered the mar
ket Albert Ehrhardt, an employe, had
been cutting meat on a block with a knife
the edge of which was as keen as that of
a razor. Ehrhardt laid the knife on the
block while he walked to another part of
the stalL The deed of the suicide wa3
witnessed by Ehrhardt and David Busich,
another butcher, and they rushed forward
to disarm the desperate man, but he was
too quick for them.
Uartlett had been separated from his
wife since last Christmas on account of
his dissipated habits. Almost every dol
lar be earned was expended for liquor,
chiefly the cheapest grade of claret, and
the afflicted woman was obliged to work
as a domestic to support herself and their
three-year-old little girl.
Bartlett, before he got so far on the
downward path, was a bright young man
and was employed at various times on
iÂ«-o morning newspapers as assistant
foreman in the mailing department.
Two years ago, Bartlett, on recovering
from a spree, slashed his throat and his
left wrist with a razor in an attempt to
Mil himself. He was sent to the City and
County Hospital until he recovered, but

STJICIDE BY GAS.
James Wightman of 3509 Seventeenth
street killed himself last Wednesday night
by asphyxiation with illuminating
gas in the bathroom of his residence. He
had been a widower for two years and
grieved very much over the death of his
wife. His despondency was increased by
the fact that he had not been, able to se
cure employment since he went out on
Btrike with the City Front Federation
nearly a year ago. He had four children,
the youngest of whom is 8 years old and
the eldest, Hattie, 19.
When Hattie and her brother John dis
covered the odor of escaping gas at 6:30
o'clock yesterday morning they traced it
to the bathroom and found their father
lying dead on the floor. The stopcock of
the single gas burner in the room was
open fully. On his person was found the
following note:
Dear Hattie: I hope you will forgive me
for this cruel deed as I cannot live the â¢way
things have been going against me. No mat
ter how I try, misfortune seems to start in my
v ay. I know it is cruel to leare you with all
the responsibility, but I cannot stand it any

PHILADELPHIA, May 1. â Cardinal Martinelli, Apostolic Delegate to the United States, stated to-day that he had
been recalled to Rome by the Pope. While declining to be interviewed, Cardinal Martinelli said he would sail for Rome
as soon as he, could adjust the affairs of the papal delegation. He has been in the city since Tuesday.
PEORIA, III, May 1. â Cardinal Gibbons was interviewed shortly after the announcement was made of the re
call of Cardinal Martinelli from Washington to Rome. Cardinal Gibbons was in Peoria attending. the silver jubilee celebration of
Bishop Spalding. He was in the company of Archbishop Riordan of San Francisco, and when shown the telegram announcing
the recall was visibly affected by the news. After reading the telegram he turned to Archbishop Riordan and said: "This is very
important; this is most sudden. We were not expecting anything of the kind so soon as this." ' ' '.â¢
Turning to the correspondent he said: "We have, of course, been. expecting this some time, but did not think the re
call would come as soon as it has. Cardinal Martinelli had arranged to be in St. Louis May 18. He had also arranged to attend
the consecration of a cathedral of another city. Of course all engagements are canceled/ I have nothing more to say in this
matter concerning the reasons for the recall. We are very sorry to lose the Cardinal, for by his conduct while in this country he
has become very much endeared to us all. There is no probability that he will return, and we are not advised as to who his suc
cessor may be." .
Cardinal Gibbons left this evening for Baltimore and Archbishop Riordan for San Francisco.
WASHINGTON, May i.â Cardinal Martinelli to-day received a cablegram from Cardinal Secretary of State Ram
polla, at Rome, notifying- him that the May consistory had- been postponed from May 15 until May 29 or June 5, and that his
presence would be desirable. This notification was as Cardinal Martinelli's plans. contemplated an indefinite: stay at
Washington. The general opinion is that Mgr. Diomede Falconio, at present delegate to the Canadas, will not be the successor
to Cardinal Martinelli, as was expected. His appointment would have been gazetted at Rome prior to this were he the selection
for this important post. It also eliminates the name of Mgr. Zaleski, delegate apostolic to the Indies, from consideration, as it,
would be impossible for him to arrive in this country in time to receive the delegation frorn the hands of Mgr, Martinelli. Ec~
clesiastical authorities here are of the opinion that Mgr. Donato Sbarretti will be made delegate apostolic at Washington. - He is
now a guest of Cardinal Martinelli. He was recently appointed apostolic .delegate to the Philippines, and has been in Wash
ington conferring with the War Department officials for the',last six weeks. . v,-

signs point to a purpose on Gage's part to
get out of the losing fight for Governor

Since Mayor Schmltz indicated that he
would serve the public in whatever ca
pacity it desired him to serve there ha3
been a good deal of talk in machine cir

scribes her husband as a man 5 feet
10 inches tall, weighing about 140 pounds.
He has a light brown mustache and hair'
and blue eyes. She savs that he is very
pale and looks very delicate.
Mrs. Jarvis visited the auditor's office
of the Southern Pacific yesterday and
found, that her husband had never come
as far as San Francisco. She also was
unable to find his trunk in the baggage
room of the ferry building.
A. W. Jarvis bade his wife good-by in
Seattle on Friday evening, the Uth of last
month. He was coming to this city lo
make application for a. position as brake
man on the Southern Pacific. He told his
wife that the moment he reached San
Francisco he would send her- word -where
he was living. She waited day after day,
but receiving no message in three weeks,
she decided to come to San. Francisco and
try to find out what became of him.
Mrs. A. W. Jarvis of Seattle is here
looking for her husband, of whom she has
received no word for the last three week^.

"To the Pacific Coast," said Mr. Mc-
Adie. "space telegTaphy means every
thing."
Wireless or space telegraphy will not
only be a benefit to the men at the bu
reau, but it will permit them to warn
steamers already at sea what kind of
weather they may expect, should storm
telegraphs be sent in from incoming
steamers.
Mr. McAdie is somewhat loth to speak
of this commencement toward the new
era. although he has been out there and
crawled up the jagged rocks to the point
w-.ere the poles of communication will
evcntualli" be set.
He wishes it to speak for itself when
it is an accomplished fact.
A station at the South Farallones is a
thing of the near future, which will mean
a space telegraphy of twenty-five miles.
"Just .think." Mr. McAdie said, "when
we shall be able to "signal chips 290 miles
at sea and be able to be regulated by
them, how our weather shall be forecast
ed along the coast."
Mr. McAdie, the chief of the bureau
in this city, knows and* feels what space
telegraphy is going to mean to this coast,
while realizing that this great discovery
is still in itsÂ» infancy.
Nowhere in America has It . been more
difficult to forecast storms than along the
territory ihat is governed by the eye of
the Weather Department Bureau sta
tioned at San Francisco.'

"That is why I had him arrested, but I
would not prosecute Â¦ Charley for all the world,
for I still love him."
The explanation satisfied Judge Smith,
who dismissed the 'case. â¢
Mrs. Morgan has Informed me that she does
not care to prosecute Shores. She said: "I
have been an old fool. Mr. Attorney: I fell In
love with Charley several months ago, and I
thought he loved me. but I guess It was all
a mistake. I became Jealous of him and fol
lowed him about until the other night, when
he slapped my face.

Because she loved him, Mrs. Jane Mor

That was the outco/ne of a Police Court

Judge Smith. Mrs., Morgan, who resides
at 25 Golden Gate avenue, fell In love
with Shores, a baker employed at tho

W T hen the case was called this morn
ing, the complaining witness failed to ap
pear. Prosecuting Attorney A. P. Leach
made the following explanation: -
For three weeks the ladies in charge
have been devoting much time to mak
ing preparations for the carnival, and it
will be the most successful one ever giv
en in Napa. The business men are tak
ing a great deal of interest In the affair
and each house will be represented. By
popular vote Elvina Amstutz was select
ed by the school children as the Mayday
Queen, and with her assistants, had full
sway at the carnival to-night. Her maids
of hpnor were Lizzie Rossi and Zora
Wilson. The crown bearer was Edna
Parker, and Johnny Even and Harold
Hoerule were the pages. All were quaint
ly attired and were loudly applauded.
Miss Mae McDermott will be queen of
the carnival, having been selected by
vote of the people. "With her court of
assistants this fair young lady will be
crowned on Friday, and she will dlrecc
affairs during the evening. On Saturday
evening King Carnival will hold high
jinks, when the fiesta closes. George D.
Secord, one of Napa's city officials, has
been selected for the role of Rex, and
when he is crowned king and assumes
charge of the closing events of the even
ing, the king and his many attendants
will make things merry for all.

The remarks of Rear L! Admiral Lord
Charles Beresford .(Conservative) rather
sided with those who .thought the Amer
ican invasion spelled sruin to Britishers.'
He Â¦said he feared 'the American trust
would use this combination to pour Amer
ican produce Into this country, to the dis
advantage of the producers here, and that
there. would be a general disruption of the
whole trade and commerce of Great Brit
ain.. Lord Beresford advocated subsidiz
ing steamers on the. Canadian route. :
Sir James Woodhouse (Liberal) dis
claimed all antipathy to or ill-feeling for
Americans; but, he asserted, British mari
time and mercantile interests were
menaced by the Americans, who had al
ready captured the British shoe and steel
Industries, and he wanted the Government
to take action in order to stem the tide., '
Other speakers held that the arrange
ment was in no way unpatriotic. It was
an alliance, not annexation by the Amer
icans. The companies had simply made
a reasonable and business-like combina
tion.
James Bryce (Liberal); former president
of the Board of Trade, advocated the
withdrawal of the motion, but urged the
Government to' make a . prompt inquiry
into the subject. \
FEARS AMERICAN TRUST.
It must be remembered that this was
not a commercial 'enterprise engineered
by 1 a. foreign arid hostile Government; but
a trade combination. Those who thought
this combination so 1 menaced the com
merce of this -country -that the Govern
ment ''shotrtawinferftere wet*' admitting,
whether they liked it or not. that the doc
trine of 'individual" enterprise had broken
down.. Â¦Â¦Â¦..<â¢:â¢.: r.: V~- ; ' : '* Â¦â¢--'â¢ - \
A few members having spoken of the
very great anxiety experienced through
out the country aea. result of the forma
tion of a combination of such strength
ar.d character as the" American shipping
syndicate, A. J. Balfour expressed the
hope that the debate would -be closed.
He quite appreciated the . importance of
the subject and the desire of the members
to dteeuss it, but 'no useful purpose could
be served by. a debate now. The Govern
ment, had been privately informed re
garding the actions of private Individuals
and it was giving the matter anxious con
sideration. If it disclosed this informa
tion it would shut the door to further
conferences. The Government would be
bound to make such -arrangements with
regard to the navy as the proposed
changes might necessitate; but, regard
ing the effect of. the combination on mari
time interests "and what should be' done
to meet it, no announcement of its policy
could be made except after prolonged and
anxious consideration of the complicated
problem. Under the present arrange
ments the subsidized ships remain in the
service of the Admiralty for another two
years, and the Government would be
much blamable if in the interim it could
not either negotiate a continuance of the
existing arrangements or make others
equally serviceable to the Admiralty and
the country. Meanwhile, the Govern
ment did not propose oh the spur of the
moment to -announce any â¢ departure : from
the traditional policy of not interfering
with the freedom of commerce. The Min
isters would be Â¦ charlatans if they did
anything of. the kind. It was necessary
to most carefully and thoroughly sift the
whole matter from a commercial point of
view. . .
A COMPLICATED. PROBLEM.
. After the' president of the Board of
Trade, Gerald Balfour, had informed the
House of Commons this afternoon that he
had been confidentially Informed of the
terms of the proposed trans-Atlantic com
bine, which aid not necessarily involve a
change'in the nationality of the ships, and
the Government leader, A. J. Balfour,
had announced that the officials of the
White Star Line did 'not appear to have
violated- their contract witn the British
Admiralty, Russell Rea (Radical), a ship
owner and merchant, movsd the adjourn
ment of the House in order to "discuss the
matter, which was of general importance.
â¢After considerable discussion Rea's mt>
tion was withdrawn. Â¦ . Â¦>
LONDON, Mayr 1.â An attempt : was
made in the House of Commons to-day to
get the Government to pledge itself to
prevent the transfer of British'./.steam
ships to a foreign flag pending the .report
of the committee recently appointed by
the Admiralty to Inquire into the subject.
The Government leader, A. J. Balfour,
pointed out that a suggestion of such a
startling character could not be carried
out without the gravest consideration. It
simply amounted to a proposal that the
Government should prevent a- British
subject from selling his property to a for
eigner. No doubt the matter referred to
was very serious, i but such a drastic
change in established practice could not
be undertaken lightly.
The visiting Bishops will remain over
Sunday and will preach in the various

Bishop and Mrs. Olmstead held a recep

Frank , B. Reagor of Orange. N. J..
brother and brother-in-law respectively of

Early in ' the .morning holy '"communion
was celebrated at the cathedral and all
the Episcopal churches in the city, with
special prayers for the Bishop-elect and
the welfare of the diocese.
After prayer and communion -service
Bishop Olmstead gave the benediction and
the services were. over.. . . .... .. :. .-Â».-Â¦
BISHOP, HOLDS .RECEPTION.
The' bidding to prayer was by Presiding
Bishop Tuttle. It was a pretty ceremony
and the 'entire congregation took part.
The litany services followed. . Next came
the examination of the Bishop-elect. This
was merely a matter of form to conform
with the ancient rules of the church, for
during modern times it has been the cus
tom to ascertain all the qualifications of
a candidate for the office before he IS pre
sented, for consecration. The most im
portant part of the ceremonies, the robing
of the new Bishop, was very- impressive.
As the, committee on consecration said the
words that made him a prince of the
church, the work of robing him began.
He' was invested with the purple and red
of his office with much ceremony, . while
the choir sang an anthem from 'Mendels
sohn. - â¢ " ' '..
After further selections by the orches
tra and , choir, Bishop John H. White of
Michigan City and Frederick W. Taylor
of Quincy, 111., clad in their Episcopal
robes, advanced to Bishop-elect Olmstead.
He arose, and with bowed, head was
escorted to the center of the altar, where
stood Bishops William H. Hare of South
Dakota and Abiel Leonard of Salt Lake,
the commission . appointed to consecrate.
The five formed a cross; as it were, while
the testimonials of the Bishop-elect were
read. Then came his promise of con
formity, one of the most solemn promises
in the ritual of the church. Scarcely a
sound could be .heard in the church ex
cept the voice of the Bishop-elect as he
made the responses. .
â¢ After prayer and a hymn. Rev. John H.
Houghton of this city, master of cere
monies, recited the creed, which was re
sponded to by the entire congregation.
Bishop Leighton Coleman of Delaware
then delivered an Interesting' and impres
sive sermon in a masterful manner.

Tlw United States army transport Logan
tailed yesterday at nonn with seventy-nine sol
diers aid 145 cabin passengers. Of the soldiers
fifty-nir.e are recruits, eleven signal corps men
and" nine belong to the hospital corr*. The cabin
passengers Trere made up of officers on their
ray to Join their commands, civilian employes,
army doctors and nurses and the wives and
families of sc'.diers and civilians, either out In
ihe Philippines or passengers O n the Jjopan.
Thrrc were thirteen army Burgeons on tlie
transport and twelve nurses. The large num
hf- of cabin passengers taxed the accommoda
tions of the vessel to the limit. The hospital
was converted into living quarters and every
available stateroom was occupied.
Two dogs were deported on the transport by
order of the Treasury Department. One was a
bulldog, the property and well beloved compan
ion of Captain Hewes of the transport Egbert,
and the other, a mastiff, belonged to Chief En
ginef-r Ran'ett of the Egbert. Although both
animals are Americans by birth their connec
tion with s. vessel that has touched at Manila
doomed them both to deportation. Captain
Danes made an appeal to the department, in
Â¦which he showed that his dog had not been al
lowed to set foot on any Oriental shore since
coming into his possession ai Seattle, many
months ago., It was of no avail, however, and
buth brutes were exiled to the Philippines.
The Locan carried about 3000 tons of sup
plies. The passengers were:

There was good action and some excitement
in oata when It was learned that the leading-
May' bull took all the COO, 000 or 700,000 bushels
deliveries for cash. The May situation is again
worrying the shorts. July closed strong lc
up, at 37%c. . â¢

and oats. July closed firm, %c up,' at C3%@
CHICAGO, May 1. â Wheat ruled uniformly
strong throughout the session. The news of
rains In the Northwest and the Southwest and
lower cables Induced some early selling, but
when it was seen that May deliveries "amount
ing to 2,000,000 bushels were readily taken up
by shippers and carriers and that there was
still a strong cash demand prices began to
advance steadily. Minneapolis was very strong
and prices there advanced 2c and imparted
much strength to the Chicago market. Coun
try offerings were still small and there was
no selling pressure after the advance began.
All 'these bullish factors taken In considera
tion pushed July to 77%c. after an opening Uc
lower to unchanged at 75%c to 75%c. Some
long lines were liquidated for profits, but the
market stood the sales well. July closed stronz

WHEAT â Chicago was much firmer, selling
from 75%@77Vic. Paris futures were nigher
and Liverpool futures lower.
Crop and weather reports continued to govern
Chicago. There was a good cash demand and
about 200 loads were worked for export. About
2,000,000 bushels of May wheat were delivered.
St. Louis bought and there was an urgent cash
demand in all markets. The Northwest was
strong and Minneapolis was ViC above Chicago.
It was tha opinion that there would be a pinch
for supplies later on, with ."fireworks" .in July
deliveries. The May deliveries at Minneapolis
were about l.GOO.OCO bushels, and all of It was
sent to the millers.
There were rains in tho Northwest and South,
and the worst sand storm ever known prevail
ing over Kansas. . One of the largest Kansas
millers wired that the State would not yield
over 30,000,000 bushels, and that all hope for
the State was gone. Four counties that raised
11,000,000 bushels last year reported a condi
tion of 30. Illinois reports were good. Tho
Cincinnati Price Current said: "The growing
crop hap been benefited by the rains, and now
looks well, except in Kansas and Nebraska."
This market was firm and higher, both on and
off call. Freights were firmer at 25s 6d bid

The situation In Butter remains the _ same,

that San Francisco parties are paying more in

New York Cotton Market.
"The apprehension of gold shipments may
exert some influence upon the market, but
there is hardly any fear of the money situa
tion being seriously disturbed thereby, as anv
irold shipments will be more than offset by
the return of funds from interior points to this
city from this time on until we are reim
bursed for the money sent from here for crop
moving purposes laFt fall. This influx of funda
i.urht to make money easier and rates lower
during the summer months â that is, up to the
l>eg:nning of the next crop movement â say
about the middle of August. The stock market
cannot fail to be stimulated by easy money,
es that furnishes facilities to operators in the
carrying of their holdings. It may further be
eaid in regard to goM fchipments that, as pre
viously stated, now that there appears to be a
fubstantial basis for the belief in the end
ing of the South African war within a short
time, the resumption of the normal production
of gold in that section will produce easier con
ditions In London, and hence relieve consider
ably the strain upon this country. Meanwhile,
railroad earnings are phenomenally large and
Wall street ie in control of the situation â and.
Indeed, why should not Wall street control the
railroads? for it was through Wall street en
terprise and by the use of Wall street capital
most o* them were built."
â¢"It is evidently the conviction of present
leaders that easy money prospects, combined
with a continuance of railroad prosperity
"which is assured by the activity of general
business and the spread of the communiiy-of
ir.tprest idea) are a sufficient basis for a new
upward movement. In such plans they un
doubtedly have the cordial support of big
banking interests, who in turn have a double
interest In seeing a more active market; firct,
to facilitate th<? promotion of important deals
v.-hieh they have m contemplation, and. second.
to assist ;tra in a partial distribution of, their
present highly, .ojactutrated holdings. These
Â£re very powerful motives for stimulating ac
tivity; snd, now that the restraint of tight
money is removed, they are bound to exert their
Eway, TnrtwrthFtiina'ing -counter influences of
an unfavorable character. Rapid and advanc
ing fluctuations have hÂ«d the usual effect of
increasing the outside interest, without which
a pood market Is impossible. At times there
have been heavy realizations, which served to
keep the market in a healthy condition and
admit of fresh buying. This selling has come
partly from outsiders, but chiefly from opera
tors who sold to take profits. There is, never
theless, a skeptical element in the street who
will sell at every good opportunity. These
parties take the view that prices are high'
enough, if not already too high; that threaten
ing legal questions affecting merger plans
hang over the market; that the crop situation
is not very promising, and that a trade reac
tion of more or less consequence cannot be far
distant, etc. There is considerable truth in
these objections; but apparently they do not
outweigh just now the forces on the other
side, which have been held in check ever since
the death of President McKinley. and which are
now enjoying their innings. A favorable eymp
tom is that speculation is largely confined to
railroad shares. Should it extend to the In
dustrials that would be a misfortune, and
"ould only end disastrously to the innocent out
siders who might be tempted in.
The New Tork circular of Henry Clews says:
"Conditions are favorable to an active stock
market for seme time to ccme. The most im
portant restraint upon speculation â a scarcity
of money â is being gradually removed, and the
various cliques and operators who have been
waiting months for favorable opportunities are
now doing their utmost to broaden and strenth
en the market. So far their efforts have met
with notable succcfs; and sufficient encour
agement has been forthcoming to warrant the
expectation that thefe who iead the present
movement will not surrender their advantage
until they have carried it as far as safety
l>ernuts.

NEW TORK STOCK LIST.
NEW TORK, May 1.â The volume of deal-
Ings fell off again in to-day's stock market
and the movement of prices of stocks Indi
cated much uncertainty and confusion of sen
timent. The flurry on call money to 15 per
cent would go far to explain the condition of
the market, but there were some supplementary
causes which were confusing and no doubt
had something to do with the rise in the
money rate. The preparation for the . May
disbursements, which are unusually heavy this
year, was of course the primary cause of the
constriction of the money supply, liut -such
a demonstration of instability as that in In
ternational 1-ower and a number, of other In
custrials, whose affairs are more or less
shrouded in mystery, yesterday and to-day had
the inevitable effect of Inducing closer scrutiny
of the character of collateral offered tor loans.
The May disbursements for dividends and in
terest are estimated at over $58,000,000 in
cluding the heavy payments lor United Stales
fcteel dividends. The sub-treasury operations
this week have taken from the banks over
?2.5C0,0OO, largely due to deposits to retire
bank circulation. There has been some de
mand from the interior, as shown by the drop
in New Tork exchange at Chicago to a dis
count. It is not strange,- therefore, in view
of the limited surplus of the banks that month
ly requirements should have sent the money
rate up to 10 per cent to-day. The rise in
the money market has had the effect of easing
the foreign exchange market, carrying it away
from the gold-export -point. The International
Power episode caused a decidedly feverish feel
ing among the obscure class of industrials
The higher grade stocks of this class were
Ies3 affected, although the United States Steel
recurities showed some depression, partly due
to some public discussion of a rather biting
character, of the financing corporation. Sugar,
Amalgamated Copper and People's Gas were
firm to strong. The grain-carrying railroads
started to advance on the over-nijjht reports
of showers in Kansas and the Northwest. â¢ but
the advance was checked by the failure of
the train market to reflect any benefit- to
the crop*. There was large and concentrated
buying of St. Paul, which seemed to" be due
to' the advance in the dividend rate on North
ern Pacific from a 4 i>er cent to a <; per cent
basis. Another notable center of strength was
In the Southern trunk lines, which had no
ether explanation than the reports of very
light north and south traffic. The movement
affected Louisville and Nashville. Illinois Cen
tral, Chicago. Indianapolis and Louisville and
to a less extent Southern Railway. The fixing
of the May semi-annual dividend rate on Penn
sylvania at 3 per cent induced large buying cf
that stock and helped the other trunk lines.
The undecided question of the anthracite
miners' terms was a weight on that portion
of the market.' The closing was Irregular..
The bond market was irregular, in sympathy
with stacks. Total sales, $2,430,000.
United States new 43 declined % per cent

A circular for Australia says: "Since the
steamer Sierra sailed on the 10th ult. there have
been the following deliveries of Australian coal,
viz.: Star of Italy. 2204 tons; St. .Â¦ Francis.
2570 tons; Jabez Howes 775 tons; total. 6740
tens. There are at present twelve vessels due
to arrive here prior to July with 32,000 tons;
three-fourths 'of these have already gone out
of first hands, hence there is but a little coal
now afloat seeking . buyers. There are on the
chartered list from Australia, to . carry coals
here, thfrty vessels, with a carrying- capacity
of .34,000 tons; of these there are fully twelve
which have hot yet reached Newcastle. The. last
reported charters for coal are quoted below 10s
per ton from Newcastle, and as the Colonial
crops are a comparative failure, a number of
carriers must seek this port for business. With
the active competition of fuel" oil for steam pur
pores and the prices at which the same is be
ing- offered, it is an assured fact that Newcastle
coals for this market must be offered at a re
duction f. o. b. from j present asking prices.
Already several steam colliers have been placed
en the. disengaged list here, as sale can not be
found for Coast coals,, both from British Co
lumbia and Washington. Steamers of large
capacity, carrying both passengers and freight.

settled each day. About 750 union men
of all trades are on a strike, and others
are threatening to go out If their demands
are not met. Nearly 300 laundry work

than two years; between two and five
years, 22 cents; five to eight years, 23
cents; eight years and over 24 cents. The
day men have voted unanimously for . a
ten-hour day. and their decision was ap
proved by Superintendent Ross. The night
men expressed a. desire to work twelve
hours or over; and this was also conceded
by the employers. The best of feeling
was exhibited on both sides and there was
at no time any threat of a strike.

When the office became vacant a few
days ago through the death of H. W.
Walton, the society officials met and sent
the name of Matthew McCurrie to Mayor
Schmitz, with the expectation that their
nominee would receive the appointment.
They were much , dismayed yesterday
when they learned that their expressed
wish had been disregarded. President N.
P. Cole said in reference to the matter:
"We have closed the pound .and there the
thing will rest for the present. We own
all the property, and I really cannot see
how- Mr. -Irwin. can get- along." - Irwin
said that he did not know what he should
do If he could not have the pound.
The society officials have called a meet
ing of the board of directors for to-day
and Irwin has been invited to be present.
-If he can satisfy, the members of the soci
ety that he will do exactly as they say
and be In every way satisfactory, it is
probable that he will be placed in charge
of the pound at a salary of $75 a month.
In such an event, he will be allowed no
fees and cannot select his deputies.
San Francisco has a new Poundmaster
in the person of Harry O. Irwin, who re
ceived the appointment from. Mayor
Schmitz yesterday. The Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals owns
what is known as the public pound and
has refused to turn it over, to the new
Poundmaster. Irwin has neither a salary
nor a pound, and unless the interested
parties come to some sort of an agree
ment, he will have to start out on a hunt
for collarless dogs and homeless cows, if
he wishes to draw any revenue from his
new office. The society officials claim
that experience in domestic animal hunt-
Ing will lead Irwin to conclude that he
has not been presented with a gold mine.
Since. January the expenses of the pound
have been 5213 55. in excess of receipts.
The difficulty has arisen as a result of
the Mayor's refusal to appoint the nomi
nee of the society, according to the prece
dent set by ex-Mayor Phelan. Several
years ago. it was arranged between the
society and the Board of. Supervisors that
the former should have charge of the
pound. The society purchased a site at
the corner of Sixteenth and Alabama
streets and erected on it the Animals'
Home. The charitable organization pur
chased horses, wagons, feed, - harnesses
and all the other necessary parapher
nalia. The city owns absolutely nothing
in connection with the pound. Receipts
have always been less than expenditures.
In recognition of this state of affairs, the
society has always bad its nominee ap
pointed Poundmaster.

The polico circulars now being- prepared
â¢will state that Charles B. Hadley is
â¢wanted for the murder of Nora Fuller, a
fact which indicates that Captain Sey
mour and his detectives have more oon
rlusive evidence of Hadley's guilt than
that which they have thus far seen fit to
disclose to the public.
The peculiar disappearance of W. tj.
Pagan, the friend of Hadloy. who boasted
while an inmate of the City and County
Hospital that the missing Examiner man
had given him a check for $300. is causing:
much comment among those interested in
the Folution of the mystery. Fagan's
parents reside in Vancouver, where his
father holds an Important Government
position. A few days ago and prior to
the publication of the story implicating
Fagan in connection with tho Hadley mat
ter. Fagan is said to have telegraphed his
relatives in Vancouver that Tie must leave
fian Francisco immediately to ev*ade being
dragged into a nasty case. It is said that
*Â»t that time Fagan went to Reno. New.
but. according to telegraphic advices re
ceived from Vancouver last night. Fa
jrsn"s relatives profess to know nothing
ft his present whereabouts except to sav
that he is no longer in Reno.
Captain Seymour will send Fagan's de
scription to the Reno police, this morninp
and if he is there he will undoubtedly bÂ«
rounded up and brought "back to Ihis'citv
to tell what be knows of Charles Hadley's
connection with the brutal murder 'of
Jvcra Fuller.
Schell. the furniture man, posltively
ldentirles Hadley's picture as that of the
man to whorn he sold the mattress upon
which the girl was murdered.
Slowly but surely the police are 'weav
ing a web of guilt around Charles B.
Kadley. the Examiner bookkeeper, who
suddenly dropped from sight the day the
story of Nora Fuller's disappearance was
published. Tha^t there are many convinc
ing circumstances which point to Hadlcy
as the murderer of the unfortunate girl
the police no lunger deny. There are two
people interested In the case who have
no hesitancy in stating openly that they
axe absolutely certain that Charles B.
Hadlcy of the Examiner is the mysterious
man who, under the name of C. B. Haw
kins, made his preparations for the young
girl's death. Kytka, the handwriting ex
pert, has fully a hundred reasons and as
many more examples of Hadley's hand
writing which are plain enough to con
vince almost anybody that Kytka's belief
that Hadlcy is the man who murdered
Nora Fuller is founded on substantial dis
coveries in the absolute similarity of the
handwriting of the suspect and that o.f
the mythical Hawkins.
The union in question is affiliated with
the Building Trades Council, of which P
II. McCarthy is president, and has no cOn
neetion with the Brotherhood of Team
sters, affiliated with the Labor Council.
The teamsters interested are. engaged ex
clusively in hauling materials used in the
construction of buildings. Should a strike
occur, as predicted, all buildings now in
course of construction ' must necessarily
be affected. â¢:â¢ . â¢....-Â¦'
With regard to. the boarding-house proposi
tion we assert that it is not compulsory upon
employes to board at our houses. ThÂ° demand
is therefore unnecessary and does not enter
into the situation as being of importance, in
a general way the demands are unreasonable
nnd the contractors belonging to the associa
tion will not grant them. We believe the
teamsters will never press the issue to a strike
Thus far we have not been consulted by any
committee of the union relative to the de
mands. Â¦ -. .
An for the demand for increased wages we
assert that the men are unskilled and that
Hie rrcs-'nt wages are all we can afford to pay.
Two years, ago we voluntarily â¢ increased the
wages of teamsters from $!â¢ 65 to $1 75 a day
and later we made It ?2. Now they demand
$2 2,j a day for single teams and $2 50 a day
for double' teams. Th<Â» demand is excessive
and we cannot allow It.' Â¦Â¦â¢Â¦-Â»Â«
CAiNNOT GRANT- DEMANDS.
The teamstprs also ask that th?y bÂ« allowed
a^/Ull day's pay even though they do not <Jo
a full day's work. If a teamster hauls only
seven wagon leads cf materials a day when
wÂ» know that he should haul ten the con
tractor has the right at present to ask why
thÂ» full day's work Is not done, and in extreme
oÂ»*r-s deductions of ray. are made. . The de
mand is now made to deprive, us. of the privi
lege of defending our. own interests and we
w:llÂ°not agree to it.
We shall never agree to the terms submitted
to us. The teamsters demand that their time
for a working day shall commence from the
time they arrive at the bams and that they
shall be rr1vi]Â»ge<i to leave their work in timÂ«
to reach the barns within a period of eleven
hours. â¢ If a carpenter lives at Xorth Beach
and he is. working on a nous" war th<Â» park
he is compelled to show up at. the building
Pt S a. m. Why should a sand teamster be
exempt from the same rule? The demand is
unreasonable.
Inquiry among the contractors yester
day developed a. decidedly firm stand
against granting the demands. The con
tractors declare that to grant them Would,
virtually drive the heavier contractors out
of business. OtW of these said y.esteniay:
The larger contractors declare the de
mands are most unreasonable and that
thpy will never agree to make the con
cessions demanded. Among these arc: C
A. Warren. Gray Bros.. San Frsncisod
Construction Company. L.. B. Sibley City
Street Improvement Company. IT. N Me-
Olure. Dave Dillon. Jerry O'Shoa M F
Sullivan. J. H. O'Brien. John Tuttle, Flinri
& Treacy. In addition to these there are
some forty other? who operate from one
to five teams. Those named operate from
ten to sixty teams each, making a total
of nearly 500 teams. â¢
The teamsters demand only their rights.
TliÂ«>y do not make unreasonable demands.
They merely ask to b? allowed to work eleven
hours a day. Our demanj for increase of pay
is virtually in accordance with the agree
ment made with the Contractors' Teamsters'
Association a year ago, which body agreed to
pay us the wages demanded on January 1.
Wo were very weak then and the association
turned us down. We are human beings and
many of us have families. All we ask Is an
opportunity to rear our children and care for
our wives like white people. At present we
work from Â«> a. m. to any hour p. m. at
wages which are wofuMy Inadequate to supply
our wants. We have thÂ» support of the build
in? trades and they ar e Interesting 'themselves
in cur behalf. We are determined to stick to
our rmint at every hazard, but we are hope
ful the contractors will pee the justness of
our demands and agree to them before Mon
day. A few have already done so, but the
larger contractors are holding out.- If they
continue -to do so until 'Monday a strike of
the teamsters is Inevitable. ,
President R. Thane cf the Building
Materials' Tea.m Drivers' Union made
the following statement of -the -situation'
last night:
DEMANDS OF TEAMSTERS.
Teamsters shall be. allowed a day's work for
t'.me spent In their employ, even though they
do not always perform the amount of work
expected of them by the contractor.
These demands must be acceded to by em
ploying contractors on or before Monday. May
5. and a failure . to comply will cause the
teamsters to refuse to longer work under the
exiMing system.
A working day of eleven ' hours beginning
at <J:->0 a. m. end ending at 5:30 p. m., this
time to Include coming: â¢ and coins of teams
to and from the barns.
It shall not be compulsory upon employes
of contractors to board at the company board-
