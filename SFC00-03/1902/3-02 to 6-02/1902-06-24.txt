â¢ "The chief scene of present activity Is
In^ the mahV central 1 pit of Halemaumau,
which was formed by the subsidence of
a great lava 1 , lake j In 1894. This is still
between' 800 and ,1000 feet deep and ap
proximately a quarter of a mile long, but
gives evidence of a great commotion with
in its walls since February last. The
flat floor 'of recently formed black lava,
then ..visible at the extreme bottom, has
disappeared. .The debris slopes from the
perpendicular walls to the center of tho
pit have radically changed their shape
and look as: if they had been violently
churned, up. There were frequent slides
and falls r of rock from the walls and
slopes of the pit; which echo up through
the smoke wHlrii' sharp metallic sound
1 producing a; weird, uncanny sound which
makes, oneVunconsciously move back from

our side we would hurriedly approach the
edge of the pit and look down Into it.
There is most certainly flre In the pl.t.
Far down in a spot almost in the exact
center of it we plainly saw a lake "of
burning Incandescent lava. We also
thought that we detected^fire at another
spot, but on account of the smoke we
could. not tell for a certainty.
"As soon as the smoke was wafted
toward us again we had to retire from
the edge of the pit, but we watched our
chance and had several good looks Into
its depths.' We did not so much see the
burning lava, however, as we . heard it.
A sound like the splashing of waves could
continually be heard issuing from the
bottom of the pit, evidently caused by
the bubbling lava splashing against the
side's of the pit. We could also hear
stones and dirt being loosened from the
sides and falling into the lava below. . >
"The sight was at its best at night, when
the fumes ; rising, from the pit , reflected
the glow* from -the molten' lava below. In
the early morning also this glow in the
smoke was plainly visible." -

Is satisfied that the present eruption will

there was V swash of the fire against -the
pit's sides /like ..water dashing : along the
beach. Judging i from -the sounds of. fall-'
. ing stones, and rocks, '.Mr.: Gray, believes
the sides of the crater are falling away
"We spent a great part of the night we
were at the Volcano House, near the cra
ter's edge, watching the wonderful
scenes which the pit presented. Over it
rose a huge column of smoke which, .when
the air was still, must have reached an
elevation of over 1000 feet. The smoke
was both white and, what is rarer, bla<;k.
It was very sulphurous, the smell being so
strong that a whiff of It was almost over
powering.
"We stayed very near the edge of tho
pit and waited for a chance to- peer into
it_ Whenever a wind from a ; favorable
direction wafted away the smoke from

~TT y ONOLULU, June 17.â News
gj H t% from the site of 'the vol-
B H canic activity on the island
Jf Jf of Hawaii, received on
"^ June 13, shows that- Pele
is still on deck . in just
about the same degree of activity as was
reported a week ago. This will be a much
more satisfactory condition for tourisra
and visitors than if the volcano developed
excessive activity, which would prevent
people from approaching the'erater. From
Sunday, June 8, to Thursday, June 12,
when the steamer Mauna Loa left Hawaii,
people on that Island had not been able
to see the sun because of dense smoke
from the volcano which had settled o\"3r*
the island, owing to the entire absence of
wind from any quarter. Through this
smoke the fire from the volcano can be
seen at intervals. There are Indications
that the present eruption will steadily in
crease, Kilauea working up to an active
boiling point with more violen.t activity.

and returned here from Hilo/lnclude Pro

TEXT OF THE COMPLAINT.
GN Information lodged by Louis
P. Boardman, John D. Spreck
els, proprietor, and W. s,
Leake, manager of The Call,"
were arrestefl yesterday after
noon for libeling Henry T.
Gage. The . warrants were Issued In tho
Police Court and served . on the defend
ants by J. Dougherty. Bail in the sum,
of $500 was given by each of the defend
ants. William R. Wheeler and Samuel
Sussman are the sureties on the bond
given by Mr. Spreckels. E. L. Wagner
and A. H. Vail are the bondsmen for Mr.
Leake. J. C. Campbell, counsel for the
defendants, asked for an Immediate ex
amination and * Police Judge Fritz fixed
10 a. m. to-day as the time for the pre
liminary hearing. Â»
The Board of Supervisors by a unani
mous vote decided yesterday to override
llayor Schmitz's veto of thirty-two spe
cific items in the next tax budget where
by he proposed to save the sum of $134.
709 to be devoted to public improvements.
In taking this action the board allows
the budget as originally adopted to be
come a law, and thus renders the Mayor's
pruning efforts of no effect.
As a result of the board's action the
Health Department will continue the em
ployment of a large number of subordi
nates and the Police Department will be
furnished with several extra men which
the Mayor's veto dispensed with. Agaii^,
the Board of Public Works will revel in
the employment of many underlings who
had been officially decapitated by the
flavor's veto and a number of salaries
will be increased as originally proposed.
In refusing to accept the Mayor's veto
of the various items of the budget which
he thought unnecessary the Board of Su
pervisors intended no disrespect to the
chief magistrate, some of the members
say, but they felt that they had been
treated shabbily in having some of their
ewi pet appropriations lopped off. Each
Supervisor had some grievance on that
ex-oj-c,^ some friend who would lose his
potion 6hou;"d the Mayor's veto Â»tairj.
Even the members of his own party-
Lou ghery. Lynch. McClellan and Wynnâ
were in that quandary and voted against
their chief.
The statement made by Dr. Williamson,
president of the Health Board, that the
I.Iayor's veto had in the main affected
only civil service employes had some
weight. Again, the Supervisors believed,
eo some of them Fay, that as the Mayor
had sat with them during their delibera
tions as a committee of the whole to con-
Eider the budget he was well aware of
what was being done and his objections
should have been noted then. Once when
sn increased appropriation was with
cLrawn after the Mayor intimated that
he would strike it out the inference was
crawn that the Items already adopted
were acceptable to his Honor.
KAYOS FEELS REBUKE.
That the Mayor felt the rebuff keenly
was plain to be seen. He had expected
that a vote would be taken on each item
end not on the budget as a whole. He
had fond hopes that the board would find
it impossible to muster the necessary fif
teen votes to override his veto and was
visibly disappointed when the odds proved
overwhelmingly against him.
Before a vote was taken on the Mayor's
veto permission was granted to the heads
cf various departments affected thereby
to be heard regarding the effect of abol
ishing positions under their supervision.
Assessor Dodge made a plea that the
Items of 5G000 for additional clerks, $500
for stationery and $2500 for maps for his
effice be restored to the budget.
Dr. Williamson, president of the Health
Board, read a statement In which he said
that with two exceptions the positions
abolished by the Mayor's veto were unier
civil service. Williamson held that if, as
the Mayor had implied, the men were in
competent, their incompetency should
have been reported to the Civil Service
Commission. Referring to the Mayor's
recommendation that the Health Officer
devote the hours between 8:30 and 5 p. m.
to his official work, Williamson said that
official's duties could not be circumscribed
by the limitations of official hours, as the
health officer was often required, to do
city work at night. .'- Â¦ â¢' '} . ;
PLEA FOB. INSPECTORS.
Williamson protested against the reduc
tion in the force of food, market* and
plumbing inspectors and quoted figures to
Ehow the large amount of work done by
them. He said that if the Mayor's cut :
cf Â£3500 for the City and County Hospital
prevailed, many articles sorely needed in
the institution would have to be dispensed
with.
Chief bf Police Wittman pleaded for the
restoration of the items vetoed by the
Xlayor, saying that the peace of the city
would suffer unless a sufficient appropria
tion was made.
Curtis wanted to hear from the City
Engineer, but Boxton objected to hearing
any more arguments from interested par
ties. He said the board had fully consid
ered the budget and had already heard all
department heads. Boxton said that he
would stand by his action in voting for the
criginal budget
Boxton withdrew his objection arid As
sistant City Engineer Mooser said that
much engineering work would have to be
cbandoned if the Mayor's cut was adopted.

LONDON. June 23.â It is coronation,
nothing but coronation in London to-day.
From the highest to the lowest, from the
uignified Peer who walked to his club
jostled, elbowed, shoved by an eager,
pushing crowd of sight-seers, to " 'Appy
'Arry" from the East End, who did mos;
cf the shovir.g and uttered the most pic
turesque ejaculations, all talked of the
coronation and the arrival of the. King.
His Majesty arrived from Windsor ac
cording to arrangements and drove in
semi-fctate to Buckingham Palace. Â¦ He
wiij loudly cheered by the great crowds
which lined the streets.
Notwithstanding the optimistic reports
to the effect that - the physicians were
satisfied with the condition of the King's
health, it was noticed that his Majesty,
when he stepped from the train and walk
ed to his carriage, leaned rather heavily
ou his cane and moved as though he
suffered pain in the small of " his bacK.
Many of those who saw him were struck
by his tired expression and pale com
plexion. - : ,;:.
One of the most interesting events of
to-day was the rehearsal of the cprona
tion ceremony In Westminster Abbey. The
"robing hall," as the new temporary erec
tion is called, was simply crowded. AH
round were drawn up men belonging to
the King's company of Grenadier Guards.
At one end Lord Edmund Talbot was sur
rounded by all his gold staff of officers.
Altogether nearly I2u were sent off under
different commanders to various places
they are to take on the great day, when
they, will act as "pew openers," as they
are facetiously called.
TWO GREAT PROCESSIONS.
\\ hen all the gold staff officers were in
tbeir places the Duke of Norfolk and va
rious heralds marshaled the two great
processions of the King and the Queen.
The King's organist was presiding at the
organ and all the boys of Westminster, In
scarlet cossacks. were stationed in their
l^roper places ready to rehearse their
shouts of acclamation. Although the pro
cessions were extremely dignified, it was
rather amusing to see the many great
people concerned wearing make-believe
trains,
While the procession was forming the
four Duchesses had rehearsals of carrying
the golden canopy. The Duchess of Port
land was wearing black lace over whit"
silk. With her walked the young Duchess
of Marlborough, who was in gray and had
entered the Abbey with her sons, little
Lord Blandford and Lord Ivor Spencer
Churchill.
Lady Mary Howard, sister of the Duke
of Norfolk,, represented Queen Alexandra
on this occasion. She wore a long made
up train of the regulation length of twen
ty feet, which was carried by eight pages
Then came the supposed King's proces
sion. Sir Spencer Ponsonby Fane repre
sented his Majesty with a long brown
cloth train, and nearly all those who are
to be in the King's procession were pres
ent.
Among them was the Duke of Devon
shire, wearing his robes and coronet-
Duke of Somerset; TTukeoT Gfaftbn Â«who
yore his coronet with long, linen robe;
Lord Lucan; Lord Londonderry, carrying
the sword of state: Duke of Norfolk-
L'ord Shrewsbury, who only carried his
coronet and did not wear his robes; Lord
Grey de ftuthven. carrying â¢ his coronet
and an imaginary gold spur and Valking
with Lord Louden, who carried the other
spur, and the Duke of Abercorn wear
ing his robes and coronet. All were at
tended by their pages.
While the procession was very interest
ing, it sadly needed the supervision of a
good stage manager, for nobody seemed
quite to know what to do.
"The act of recognition" was the first
to be rehearsed. Sir Spencer Ponsonby
Fane, preceded by the Archbishop of Can
terbury and the Lord Chancellor, were
conducted to the four sides of the
'â¢theater," and the Archbishop said
"Sirs, we present unto you King Ed
ward, undoubted King of this realm
Wherefore all you who are come this day
to do your homage, are you willing to do
the game?" Whereupon everybody shout
ed out at the instigation of the Duke of

GAGE AND JUSTICE DOWNING.
Governor Takes Another Flight to
San Pedro to Gain Time.
SAN PEDRO, Cal., June 23.â Another
move was made here to-day by Governor
Henry T. Gage in his libel suit against
John D. Spreckels and W. S. Leake. The
Governor, accompanied by Attorney
Johnson Jones of the District Attorney's
office, came down from- Los Angeles this
morning and appeared before Justice
Henry C. Downing of Wilmington Town
ship, about 11 o'clock. An oral application
was made to Justice Downing to make
an order requiring the appearance of
Messrs. Spreckels and Leake before him
on some certain day for their arraignment
and examination^ .- Â¦"
It Is evidently the intention of Gage
and the District Attorney's office not to
wait for a decision from Judge Fritz In
San' Francisco, but to proceed without
regard to the case so far as Fritz's court
is concerned. Justice Downing was seen
i.M regard to the 1 matter., and when asked
as to the status of the application said
that he had the matter under advisement
r.nd that the District Attorney would be
in San Pedro to-morrow at 11:30 a. m., at
which, time he would -give his decision
so far as the application made to-day
was concerned. Continuing* he said:
â¢ "There is no question that the ap
plication will be granted to-morrow. It
is simply a matter of legal form. I will
order the defendants to appear for ar
raignment and examination." -
Justice Downing, when asked what date
he would- set for the arraignment and
ffXtmination, replied that he perhaps
would -order the appearance of Messrs.
Spreckels and Leake for next Monday,
June 30. Upon making a decision to-mor
row, the order will be placed In the hands
of Sheriff William Hammell of Los An
geles County, who will then proceed to
San Francisco.
His Clothes Are Nearly Burned Off

COLUMBIA. Mo., June 22.â The dead
body of Archibald Buckner, with the
clothes nearly burned off and the flesh
charred, has been found in the woods near
Rock Bridge. Evidence brought out at
the Coroner's Inquest shows that Buckner
was seen alive in company with David
Grant, drinking at the house of William
Moore. Grant left the house first, Buck
ner following.. Shortly afterward three
shots were heard. Grant returned to tho
house and asked for matches, saying he
had shot Buckner, but making no ex
planation. Search for the body was not
made until the next day. when the body
was found badly burned. Grant has dis
appeared.

Man of 70 Years, Wounded and
Without Food, Displays Re- .
i. markable Endurance.
PENDLETQN; Or., June 23.âThrough
out eighteen days and nights of torture,
with his head crushed by a fall, Joseph
Reyburn crawled, about helpless In the
wild stock country southwest of here.
Reyburn Is 70 years old, yet so wonderful
Is his endurance that he will recover.^Hls
is one of the most remarkable cases Of
hardihood ever recorded.
Reyburn . started to James Baxter's
ranch, fifteen miles from Shanlko, on
horseback. When half way there his sad
dle cinch broke, throwing him. His head
struck a rock. For forty-eight hours he
lay , unconscious; then, impelled by thirst,
he slowly dragged himself to Brush Can
yon, a half-mile distant, for water.
. For sixteen days the unfortunate cattle
man crawled, digging up roots and herbs
with his hands. These were his only food.
Eighteen days after .V his injury a Crook
County . .cattleman^ * :Ewen McLennan,
found him one v ,mile from Brush Canyon,
a mere buiidle, Q.f/skin a/id bories. : Expos
ure toi. the chilly Oregon nights and lack

CBAWXS 'OVER GROUND
FOR EIGHTEEN DAYS
If we are to have reorganization, Cleveland
himself should 'accept the Presidential nomina
tion. It would be due him; his reinstatement
would be poetic justice to him and retribution
to those whose Democratic conscience revolted
against his undemocratic conduct. Of courss,
he would get no Democratic votes, but, being
cioser to plutocracy than any Republican likely
to .be nominated, he might divide the enemy,
and even Democrats would have what little
consolation would come from receiving thejr
disappointment In advance.
Mr. Cleveland's speech should be read In full
It answers a useful purpose. It outlines the
plan of campaign decided upon by the pluto
cratic elements for which the reorganizes
stand. â¢ Tariff reform is to be made the chief
issue and the men who voted for Mr. McKin
ley, the high priest of protection, are to carry
on a sham battle with their companions of
1896. while the financiers make the dollar re

TO WAGE SHAM BATTLE.
He (Cleveland) secured hi* nomination in
1S02 by a secret bargarn with the financier*;
this committee collected from the corporations
and spent the largest campaign fund the party
ever had; he filled his Cabinet with corporation
agents and placed railroad attorneys on the
United States bench to look after the interests
of their former clients. He turned the Treas
ury over to a "Wall street syndicate, and the"
financial member of ! his official family went
from "Washington to become the private 'at
torney of the man who forces (?) the Treas
ury Department to sell him bonds at- 105. and
then resold them at 117. He tried to, prevent
the adoption of the Income tax j provision,
refused to sign the only tariff reform measure
passed since the war, and while thundernig'
against the trusts in his messages, did even
less than Knox has done to Interfere with their
high'-handed methods.
His administration, instead of being a foun
tain of Democracy sending forth pure and re
freshing streams, became a stagnant pool from
whose waters foul vapors arose â poisonous to
those who lingered near. ,
Having debauched his party, he was offended
by Us effort to reform, and gave comfort to
the enemy. Â¦ Virginlus killed his daughter to
save her chastity; Cleveland stabbed his party
to prevent Its return to the paths of virtue.
Eryan says he will print in his paper
Cleveland's speech "to show that the re
organizers don't want harmony but con
trol, and that their control means the
abandonment of the party's position and
a return to the policies and practices of
Cleveland's second administration." He
continues: Â¦Â¦ -Â¦â¢-Â¦Â¦
DON'T WANT HARMONY.
He not only boasted of hi* course, but put
his brand upon those who sat at meat with
him. Havlr.g asserted that his Democratic

He la not only defiant, but he Insists that
party success can only be secured by an open
and avowed return to his ideas. Harmony id
to be secured not by the supp-esslon of differ
ences, . but by the elimination of those who
differ from him.
He epoke of Ms retirement from political
activity, and salu "perhaps there are thoaa
who would define my position as one of han
i&hment instead of retirement. Against this
J shall not enter a protest, it is sufficient for
me In either case that I have followed on the
matters of difference within our party the
teachings and counsel of the great Democrat
In whose name party peace and harmony are
to-night invoked. No i-onfession of party sin

LINCOLN, Nebr.", June 23.â The absence
of W. J. Bryan from the Democratic har

explained by a statement given out by
Mr. Bryan, to-night, commenting on the

there is no such thing as Democratic har

There oÂ«n be no such thins as harmony be
tween men like him and those who believe in
Democratic principle*, and he Is frank enough
to say so. He spent no time looking for
"middle ground" upon which to pather to
gether the discordant elements. . He boldly
called upon the members of the party ta
abandon their convictions and accept the con
struction which he places upon Democratic
principles. He evsn taunted the party with

Norfolk, "God save King Edward."
King Edward and t Queen Alexandra
gave a grand dinner party to-night .at
Buckingham Palace to seventy royal per
sonages who practically represented' the
sovereigns of all the monarchies of the
world. -
The list of their Majesties' guests was
headed by the Czarewitch of Russia, who
arrived in London this evening, and in
cluded an imposing array of Princes and
Princesses and all the Â¦ members of the
British royal family- >Â¦Â¦/;:
. Buckingham Palace r : was beautifully
decorated and the bands of the Grenadier
and the Coldstream Guards , discoursed
throughout the evening. The-dinner was
followed by a "brilliant reception, which
was attended by the members of the
suites of all -the foreign potentates now
in London. ... - ... ,
j Joseph Chamberlain, the Colonial Sec
retary, and Mrs. Chamberlain t received
the Colonial Premiers -and other distin
guished visitors from Great Britain's col
onies at their .London residence to-night.
I. None of the special envoys who ar
rived her$ to-day, though they included
Princes of the greatest European dynas
ties, aroused as much interest as did Ras
Makonnen. the AbysSlnJan general and
special representative- of / King- Menelik.
In picturesque and barbarian splendor the
Ethiopian commander. and bis suite paled
even the brilliancy of the Oriental Princes
whom London has become accustomed to
during the past week. Makonnen, who has
black curly hair and a beard, wore a cloak
of white silk, pantaloons, a shoulder capo
of heavy white satin bordered with gold
and a broad brimmed green felt hat'.
Thrpe native chiefs who accompanied him
were scarcely less gorgeous in their ap
pareL while an African priest, carrying a
heavy silver, crozier, was the general's
constant companion. Ras Makonnen's na
tive followers carried guns and spears.
Among the other arrivals to-day were
Prince Henry of Prussia, the Archduke
Francis Ferdinand, heir presumptive to i
the throne of Austria; tho Prince of th'n
ABturias, Crown Prince Gustaf of
Sweden and Norway, Admiral Gerv&ia,
head of the French Mission, and Mgif.
Merry del Val, the papal envoy.
RECEIVED BY THE PRINCE. ;
The Prince of Wales had a busy day in
receiving the royal guests related to his
family who arrived in London. He paid
thiee separate visits to the Victoria Sta
tion for this purpose, where a special re
ception room, gay with palms and flow
ers, had been arranged. The last guest
to be received by the Prince was the
Czarewitch of Russia, who had arrived oh
one of the Russial imperial yachts and
land 1 *! at Gravesend. . :
The enormous and daily growing crowds
and the babel of foreign tongues in Lori
don may, perhaps, be considered, so far
the most striking feature of. the corona
tion festivities. Early morning sees crowds
of cyclists, mostly women, wheeling along
the routes of the procession to view the
decorations. *
Later in the day there an end'
less stream of vehicles of every conceiVa
ble description, from the aristocratic
equipages of the wealthy to humble cos*

entire families seated on chairs and stoo'T.

nationality are driven over the* routes
there is fighting for the outside seats on
omnibuses and on the sidewalks are densÂ«

The Commissioner of Police has issued
an explanatory notice saying that the
barriers which have been erected along
the routes will not necessarily be cloFed
during the processions, but from present
appearances such a course will be abso
lutely imperative to prevent serious acci
dents. . â¢

Miller of having lied about the Police and

the Continent for some time past in the
interest of the Boers, have started for
England, with the view, . it is said, of
taking the steps necessary to permit of
their return to South Africa. .
Subsequently, at a luncheon, in accept
ing the presentation of a sword of honor,
Lord Kitchener took the responsibility of
having enforced martial law in Cape
Colony. He declared it had prevented a
general rebellion by stopping the dissemi
nation of news. Now he asked for the
suppression of all racial feelings and all
leagues and bonds. Britain and Boer had
a good fight and were now shaking hands.
Lord Kitchener also said his hearers
could be sure that the rebels would not
be dealt with vindictively.

Supervisor Brand enstein addressed the
Mayor in the, following words:
"Your Honor, on behalf of the Finance
Committee and the Board of Supervisors,
sitting as a committee of the whole, I de
sire to state that we labored hard In an
endeavor to frame a budget which would
do justice to all departments of the city
government. The time was not sufficient
tor you to determine the correctness of
our conclusions In the premises and I do
not think that you have acted judiciously
in cutting out the items which we adopted
after thorough deliberation. With all
deference to you I maintain that the re
commendations of the entire board should
stand and I .trust they will."
After action was taken on the budget
an ordinance was passed to print fixing
the tax levy for the next fiscal year at
$12262 on each $100 of assessed, valuation.
Of this amount $1 is for municipal ex
penditures and the conduct of city govern

MAYOR EXPRESSES REGRET.
Last night the Mayor issued the follow
ing statement regarding ther action of. the
Supervisors in overriding his veto mes
sage: â¢ - --":' .-*â¢',
The action of the Board of Supervisors In
overriding the thirty-two Hems that I vetoed
without giving due or any consideration to each
separate Item is a matter of sincere regret on
my part. My veto message was actuated solely
for the purpose of solving the problem of re
ducing the large salary roll of the various de
partments of the municipal government, and
the determination that I arrived at. was only
afte'r very careful study and investigation ex
tending over the entire period of my Incum
bency. It is a matter of sincere regret that the
Supervisors did not see fit to sustain me in my
veto of the different items of the budget, for I
tried and I believe I have treated every item
with fairness, and certainly did not expect
them to stand with the chronic office-holders.
. One of my pledges to the people before elec
tion was that. I would cut off all ornamental
salaries and have the niqney used therefor de
voted to public Improvements, and that I felt
sure that if I were elected I could save at le/Ist
$100,000 to the citizens of San Francisco by the
curtailing of unnecessary and overpaid em
ployes. Upon a clÂ«se examination . of the
budget and in listening to the arguments before
thg committee of the whole, I found that I
could do even more than I had promised,
namely, -to reduce the running expenses of the
city $100,000, and would. have succeeded in re
ducing the running expenses of the city gov
ernment $134,700, and with a sincere belief that
I was not impairing the efficiency of. any de
partment, ' and with the proper management
that the affairs of this municipality, could lje
run Just as successfully, and more so. than had
been done In the past two years.
I have carried out my pledge that I made to
the' people before election, and whether the Su
pervisors'in not upholding my action have car
ried out theirs I leave the public to decide.
This defeat In trying to save to the city $134,
700, like the ones I have sustained In the past
In trying to rid the city of Incompetent and
corrupt officials, will not deter me in the least
In further trying to do my duty as I see It, as
a man and as a servant of the. people.
The Supervisors must admit themselves 'that
the very last hours of their deliberation , was
simply a farce, and that the different Items of
the budget were carried over without that
careful deliberation and consideration which
this very Important question warranted. I took
up their work from where they left off, having
fully ten days longer to devote to it than they
had, and again I say in closing /that it is a
matter of extreme "resret on my part, and I
feel. sure on the part of the public at large that
the city should be deprived of the benefit of the
$134,700 that would have been saved to the tax;
payers of San. Francisco by sustaining the dif
ferent items that I vetoed.

.The judicial investigation which Gover
nor Gage seeks to stAve off by skulking
away to San . Pedro will overtake him
sooner than he expects. The information
lodged in the court yesterday will bring
the iss.ue to a speedy trial. Gage can go
ahead and, ostrich-like, stick his head in
every sandy spot south of Tehachapi, but
his dodging tactics and evasivs methods
will be met by insistent demand for a
speedy hearing in the courts.-
The people of California, desire to know
the inside facts concerning the conduct of
affairs at San Quentin prison. . Many cit
izens profess to believe that the prison
management is not so bad as The Call
represented it to be. Governor Gage went
over to the prison, made a secret investi
gation on his own account and gave him
self a clean bill of health.
THREATENS FOB WEEKS.
He occupied three weeks' time In plum
ing himself on his honesty and threaten
ing to punish "his traducers" and then,
when h&Â» ascertained that public patience
would not tolerate further delay, he flea
to San Pedro and procured warrants' for
the, arrest of John D. Spreckels, proprie
tor, and W. S. Leake, manager of The
Call. Since the issuance of the San Pedro
warrants he has employed counsel in San
Francisco to interpose every possible ob
jection under the law to prevent-a.hear
ing of the case in a court near, the scene
of his administrative activities.
Indications are that the prison directors
and 'Warden Aguirre will be compelled by
immediate process of law to bring the San
Quentin books into court, and bring them
in before ,the Republican State conven
tion meets .and even before.'ths primary
election occurs. The prospects are that
Daniel Kevane, secretary of the State
Board of Examiners, will be compelled to
bring to court the records of his office.
It is to be expected that Governor Gage
and his henchmen will put forward every
obstacle that criminal lawyers can sug
gttst'to prevent production of the proof.
The people, however, j will hail with de
light the prospect of -sa- speedy trial,
wherein proof to sustains all the charges
made by The Call may. be submitted in
open court.* â¢â¢....- '.-'.. ,. â¢; ..,
The public is weary of the Gases. secret
inquiry at San Quentin and the Gage eva
sion : at San Pedro. Citizens are ? qulto
willing that he shall bring, as^many dam
age suits as he pleases- to recover money
from newspaper proprietors,, and bring
them wherever it strikes his fancy to file,
his pleadings. The public is quite willing
that he 'Â¦ shall arrest an editor for . crim-;
Inal Ubel-every day of the'^year, but the
public, nevertheless, demands that the
Governor shall place no; obstacle in. the.
way of a speedy, judicial .investigation!
touching the charges. . of corruption and
thievery at San Quentin. . prison. If the
Governor shall further seek to hinder or
impede a trial of this issue . in ; a court
where the records can. be readily ob
tained and the witnesses can be speedily
brought he will forfeit every. . claim to '

Of the history of the Toppan case there
is much that the public will never know.
Ir would be impossible to tell the com
plete story of the life of the woman be
cause it would be laughed down as Im
probable and utterly foundatlonless. This
murderess had a passion for setting 1 fires,
as well as a greed for sacrificing human
lives. One instance showing her com
bined manias may be cited. She was em
ployed as a nurse in the family of a well
kiown lawyer of this State, but had no
opportunity to kill off her patients. When
the houee was comparatively deserted one
n?ght she deliberately set fire to one of
the rooms, hoping that the spread of the
flames might accomplish what she did not
dare otherwise attempt â the destruction
of a helpless and powerless womanâwith
out suspicion falling upon her. Fortunate
ly the fire was seen in time to save " the
patient. . .
Four of the murders to which she con
fessed have been made public by the
State officials, but the identity of the vic
tims of the other three is merely a matter
of conjecture. Inasmuch as she is sus

SAN RAFAEL, June 23.â Frank Haynes,
alias Miller, who 'killed Jerry Harris, a
fellow-convict, in San Quentin on March
13, was brought to trial to-day before Su
perior Judge Angellottl. The case of
Miller is a peculiar one, and the pro
ceedings will be exceptional in the history
of California's criminal trials. Miller,
though on trial for his life, is without
counsel, and vehemently protested when
Judge Angellotti sought to appoint an at
torney to represent him.
"When the case was called Judge Angel
lottl asked the defendant if he was ready
to proceed, but received no answer. He
asked a second ami a third time, where
upon Miller replied:
"I object to this trial proceeding."
"Well," said the court, "have you any
legal reasons to offer?"
No answer.
/'Uentlemen, we will proceed with the
case," said the court. "Mr. Miller, have
you an attorney?" â¢
Judge Angellotfl repeated this question
five times before Miller gave a negative
answer.
"If you desfre it the court will appoint
one," said Judge Angellotti. "In fact, I
did appoint "counsel and am still willing to
appoint any one. you desire."
To this Miller made no reply, whereupon
the court asked Attorney Hawkins to be
present during the trial and see that the
defendant had his legal rights at all
times. At this juncture Miller, half rising
fiom his chair and shaking- his linger at
Judge Angellotti, exclaimed:
"Mr. Hawkins will not dare touch the
case and you shall not allow him to
do so."
A recess of fifteen minutes was taken,
after which the trial proceeded. Judge An
gellotti, addressing the prisoner, said:
"If the defendant at any time desires
counsel this court will appoint one. Also,
if defendant wishes to excuse, any jurors,
he can do so."
The questioning of talesmen was begun
and finished within a half hour, Miller of
fering no objection or displaying any con
cern. A number 'of witnesses were exam
ined, telling the story of the prison
tragedy. The trial will continue^ to
morrow.
Just what defense the convict will offer
is not known. However, he has had sev
eral witnesses subpenaed from Lassen

CORNING, June 23.â Corning was vis
ited this evening by a fire which swept
away almost all of the buildings in one
entire block. The blaze started in the
hay loft of Henley & Motz's livery stable.
In three minutes the structure was con
sumed, together with twenty horses, the
fire engine and all the vehicles. A stiff
wind from the west carried the flames
to the large barn belonging to R. A.'Fos
ter & Co., which rapidly burned and
spread the flames to the tankhouse of
Foster & Woodson's real estate office.
This was soon consumed, shutting off
the water supply and leaving the May
wood colony at. the mercy of the ele
ments. For some time it was feared that
the Hotel Maywood, just across the street
irom the Maywood colony office, would
suffer the same fate, but vigorous work
by a bucket brigade saved the structure.
The loss Is estimated at J10.000.

As an interesting scientific fact it is to
be noted that in "Lyell's Geology" men
tion Is made of a number of places where
prehistoric remains of this kind have
been discovered, and In all instances the
localities are not far above sea level. This
specimen was found in a place of 5000 feet
altitude.
Mr. Maitland while engaged In business
in London had a great deal to do with
selling ivory, and says that he must have
seen every elephant tusk sold I here In
many years, but he does not remember
having seen a tusk approaching in 3ize
even what remains of this one. The skel
etons of mammoths seen in museums
have tusks about ten feet long and six
inches in thickness. The tusk just found
being much thicker, Â¦ ualeologists will de
termine the dimensions of the great beast

WEAVERVILLE, June 23.â An im
mense tusk of a pachyderm has been un
covered by men working the monitor of
the Trinity Gold Placer Mining Syndicate
of, London at its mines on Coffee Creek.
Superintendent . William Maitland says
the man who had charge of the, monitor,
called the piper, had gone forward to,ex
amine his bank and noticed a curious ob
ject protruding from the ground. He
supposed it was rock of some unusual
kind and picked up a piece for examina
tion. It was found to be very oily on the
surface and that considerable oil re
mained in the gravel bed. He summoned
assistance and an enormous tusk was un
covered. The point of the tusk was rest
ing on bedrock, the other end sticking up
through the gravel. All that was under
the ground was perfect, but badly de
cayedâso much so that it broke into
pieces "of its own weight when moved.
The recovered portion is six feet In
length and nine inches in diameter at the
thick end. The stream from the monitor
strikes with terrific force and doubtless
destroyed much, of the fossil before its
discovery.

the suits.
As a result of the provision in the" act

years after the act went Into effect about
80 suits have been filed by parties claim

"One of my special objects is to arrange

BAKER CITY, Or., June 23.â A party of
fishermen returning from Rock' Creek to
day reported what might have been a
frightful disaster at Lake Kalamacus on
Friday .night. An irrigation company has
been engaged in boring a tunnel under
the bottom of the lake, a distance of
about 250 feet, so that the water could be
used during the dry months. The tunnel
was so planned that it would strike a
point about sixty feet below the bottom
of the lake. An uprise was started from
the end of the tunnel to tap the lake bot
tom, supposed to be sixty feet above.
Friday evening the workmen put in a
shot in the solid rock in the uprise.' With
a mighty roar the water of the lake broke
through into the tunnel, and just a mo
ment after the men gained, a place of
safety a stream of water six feet square
was spouting several hundred feet down
the canyon. Rock Creek at once became
a roaring torrent. Fortunately, there
were a lot of trees -in the lake, which
were uprooted- by the rushing water and
carried into the tunnel, thus stopping to
some extent the outflow. Had it not been
for this hindrance a mill and store build-
Ing on the creek below would have been
washed away and several farm, buildings
destroyed.
The lake is now empty and is useless as
a reservoir fo rthis season.

PENETRATE LAKE'S BOTTOM
Word came from WaEhoe City that the
reported discoverer of the mine had
brought in a quantity of the rock and
that he had said that plenty more was in
sight. The party that was reported as
the discoverer is a man by the name of
Miles, and he has been In this section for
the past three months hunting over the
liills. especially in the Little Valley
country, where the hidden treasure is
supposed to be located. Others have been
in the search, and not one has ever re
turned with any ore that resembles Bark
ley's.
All sorts of stories as to the richness
of the rock are in the air, and some say
that the Hobarts have managed to get
hold of some samples that Barkley sold,
and that the assays were in the thou
sands of dollars. Some of the rock shown
in this city would do credit to any cabi
net specimens and looks almost too good
to be real.
EICH ORE HT SIGHT.
Two days ago word reached this city
that the Hobart sleuths had uncovered
the ledge. Immediately Barkley mounted
a horse and headed for the hills with a
rifle over his shoulder and a belt of car
tridges strapped around his waist. It is
said that if he discovered the rumor to
be true he will make a. strong 1 fight to
hold a Just share of the property he
opened to the world.
Soon after Barkley left San Francisco
detectives were dispatched to Nevada.
Among them was Thacker of Wells, Far-
Eo & Co. fame. Some of them shadowed
the engineer in the hope that he would
lead them to the treasure, while others
searched every portion of the Hobart
holdings to find whence the ore had be6n
dug. But the ledge had been carefully
covered, and whatever rock had been
taken therefrom had been worked by the
band process.
The Hobart heirs did not submit their
answer for some time. In the meantime
they attempted to locate the mine for
themselves, but, being' unsuccessful, of
fered Barkley 15 per cent of whatever he
might take from the claim. The discov
erer rejected the proposition, and, con
cealing his lind more carefully, sat down
to await developments. Barkley said he
would let the secret die with him rather
than accept such terms.
Barkley tried to keep his secret until he
obtained possession of the ground. He
visited San Francisco and tried to make
a purchase, but found that the news of
his discovery had reached the Hobart
heirs in some mysterious manner and he
Â¦was obliged to confess the facts, though
concealing the location of his mine from
them. Negotiations were then conducted,
which would permit Barkley to work the
property on a percentage proposition.
HEIRS SXTB2OT PROPOSITIONS
The story is one almost without prece
dent. The mine, which from samples of
ore taken from it rivals in wealth the
properties that made millionaires of some
of the argonauts, was discovered by Bud
Barkley, en engineer on the Virginia and
Truckee Railroad. When Barkley real
ized from the assays the richness of his
claim he searched the records to ascer
tain his title to the land and found it be
longed to the Hobart estate and was
secured by a United States patent. It is
timber land and runs a considerable
distance on the mountain side west of
Carson.

The friends of the two officials could
hardly believe the news of the suspen
sion. Davis and Cook have been in the
northern service between four and five
years.
McMichael and his assistant, James
Belton, left Vancouver only a month ago
for Dawson, and they lost no. time in
making an examination of the books. It
is said that the alleged frauds have ex
tended over a period of three years.
The inspector spent some time at White
Horse adjusting affairs on his way down
the river, and his leisurely tour gave
no outward sign of the disclosures, he
was successful in making in the Daw-
Eon office.
DAWSON, Y. T. (via Vancouver), June
22.â Charged with having received large
sums of money from American companies
for complicity in extensive frauds against
the Government two officials quit their
offices in Dawson to-day. They were D.
W. Davis, Collector of Customs for the
port of Dawson, and A. A. Cook, chief
clerk in Davis' department. On Saturday
they were suspended, and to-day they
slipped their resignations into the hands
of Chief Inspector McMichael, who had
gone north especially to investigate cus
toms leakages. It is alleged that sums
totaling $50,000, with incidental penalties,
are lacKing in the receipts of the office,
and that Davis accepted various sums
in connection with these frauds. McMi
chael spent little more than a week in
the examination of the books and out
side affairs, and then suspended the Col
lector until action could be taken in Ot
tawa. In the meantime E. S. Bushby has
been appointed to take the position of

unusually, heavy one and causes the re

a^vait their trials in fear and trembling.
Judge McClarnen is the first Butte Judge
to give such a heavy sentence and he de
clares he will do all he can to rid Montana
of objectionable characters.
Thirty Years for Thirty Dollars.
De Armond of Missouri spoke at con
siderable length in opposition to the ad
ministration's Philippine policy. The other
speakers to-day were Olmsted of Pennsyl
vania, Williams of Illinois, Corliss of
Michigan and W. W. Kitchin pf North
Carolina. ; Â¦
Grosvenor in his speech also defended
the rules of the House against the crit
icism passed upon them and paid a high
tribute to Speaker Henderson's impartial
ity. .
. Debate on the Philippine civil govern
ment bill warmed up- in the House to
day and henceforth promises to be of a
much livelier character. The increased
-nterest is due to the injection into the
debate of a comparison of the cruelties
charged to have been practiced in the
Philippines with those which occurred
during the Civil War. The subject has
been lightly touched upon once or twice
before, but attracted little attention until
Grosvenor of . Ohio to-day revived the
memory of the extremities to which Grant
and Jackson were put during the Rebel
lion. This was followed late in the day
by a speech from Mahon of Pennsyl
vania, In which he paraded the horrors of
Andersonville and Llbby prisons. He pre
dicted that in the coming- elections the
American people would stand by the "boys
in blue."
During the greater part of the session
the unfinished business, the bill ratify
ing a convention with the Choctaw and
Chickasaw Indians, was under discussion.
It was not disposed of.
Beveridge of Indiana, chairman of the
committee, ' said, the measure had been
put over until next session by the com
mittee because it was not believed there
would be time now to consider it properly.
No action was taken on the motion.
.WASHINGTON, June 23.â A motion was
entered- formally in the Senate to-day by
Quay of Pennsylvania to discharge the
Committee on Territories from- , further
consideration of what is known as the
omnibus territorial billâ a measure to ad
mit as States the Territories of Okla
homa, New Mexico and Arizona. Quay
gpoke briefly but forcibly in support of his
motion, maintaining that both political
parties in national convention had pledged
themselves to the admission to statehood
of the Territories.
Rogers will not be asked to appear, but
Chairman Dalzell had written him to for
ward an explanation: of a dispatch which
Christmas quoted- as. sent by Rogers, say
ing the negotiations were again on. The
committee also talked over the report and
will $ reassemble later to j pass on this
fcranch. . â¢ Â¦ Â¦ . â¢ â¢ .
Richard P. Evans, -one of the attorneys
mentioned, denied some of the statements
mada concerning himself. > . â¢
White's -letter is a detailed account of
his visit to Denmark to bring about an
agreement for the' sale of the Islands.
H. H. Rogers -of the Standard Oil Com
pany sent a letter in which he says he
had Jiut one Interview with .Christmas and
that was devoid of importance. He adds:
"The, Â«Â»tory. he tells as to my. claim of the
ownership of twenty-six ' United 1 States
Senators, is "simply a falsehood, and so
absurd on Its -face that it is hardly worth
referring to."- > â¢/ Â¦ â¢ -. .- .Â¦-
Rogers offered to corns as a witness if
the committee wanted him. â¢'
WASHINGTON, June 23.â The . special
committee of the House of Representa
tives Is investigating charges in connec
tion Â¦vrith the purchase of the Danish
West Indies. It resumed its duties to-day
and Chairman Dalzell laid before the
members a number of papers, including
letters from the United States Minister to
Denmark, Mr. Swenson; Henry White.
Secretary of the United States Embassy
at London, and Captain Walter Christmas'
who has been the central figure In con
nection with the charges. Secretary Hay
forwarded the letters without commenting
on their contents. Swenson's letter in
closes that handed to him by Captain
Christmas, In which the latter states that
Neils Gron obtained his confidential report
by foul means; that he has reason to be
lieve that Gron falsified it and denies a
number of allegations which it contained.
He says he never tried, to Impress Min
ister Herring that bribery was the only
way of getting the islands sold. He had
not given the name of any Congressman
in connection with the use of money. IIÂ«
makes a general denial of several matters.
Minister fewÂ«-neon says - that in view of
Christmas' character and "absurd and
contradictory statements," he attaches no
importance to the letter.' He says the
opponents of the sale of the islands are
using the Gron-Chrlstmas scandal to pre
vent ratification of the treaty.

THE Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Sonoma, Captain von Otcr
endorp. arrived yesterday morn
ing from Australia with 262 pas
sengrers. a large cargo and th<?
Australian-British mails. In spite of
rough weather between Auckland and
Pcgo Pago and a heavy fog encountered
off this port the Sonoma reached port
ahead of schedule time.
Among the Sonorr.a's passengers was
Commander Blocklinger of the navy and
lately in command oX the gunboat Wheel
ing at Pago Pago. He was accompanied
fajr Mrs. Bloeklinger and is home on sick
leave.
The Sonoma brought from Honolulu the
three mates and thirteen sailors of the
ill-fated British ship Fannie ICerr, which
was destroyed by fire last month about
7iO miles to the northward of the Ha
waiian Islands. Captain Gibbons and his
wife remained in Honolulu.
A. L. Dearlove, who has been in Ho
nolulu in connection with the new Pa
cific cable, was a passenger on the So
noma, and E. J. Russell, the representa
tive in Australia of the Standard Oil
Company, was also on board.
On the Sonoma's outward voyage L.
Leonard Ferguson, an oiler, was killed
by being caught in the shaft. The acci
dent occurred soon after leaving Pago
Pago. Deceased was burled at Auckland.
The Sonoma left Sydney on June 3 and
â¢was j' days 12 hours coming up from Ho
nolulu. The drought situation in Aus
tralia was still serious when the Sonoma
?a.iied. but the plague appeared to have
been checked.
There were no deaths from the latter
cause the week before the liner left.
There were three stowaways on the So
noma: one from Auckland, the others
from Honolulu.
Among the passengers were:
Sydney â Mr. and Mrs. E. Crookshant, Miss
3S. Orookshank, Miss K. Crookshank. Miss
Murdock. Mr. and Mrs. R. H. Wilkins. Miss
K. Peary. Mr. and Mrs. E. L. Russell. Mr. and

This, however, may become compli
cated by propositions to attach conditions
to the concurrence, one of the conditions
under discussion being a time limit for
the period of negotiation to secure the
perfected title. ' y_
The friends of the Panama project have
been making a canvass of the strength
of the Senate amendment in the House
and are confident that a motion to concur
can command a majority.
The House conferees appeared at the
appointed time, 2. o'clock., but through a
misunderstanding the Senate conferees
were not on hand, and the meeting went
over until 11 b' clock to-morrow.
The length of the contest will depend,
therefore, on the, duration of the insist
ence of Hepburn and Davey for the Nica
ragua route and the attitude of -the
House in supporting such an insistence.
There Is little indication as to how long
this insistence will last, but statements
made by the House conferees lead to the
belief that the Insistence will not. be car
ried, to the point of a permanent dead
lock, defeating all 'canal legislation at
this session.
WASHINGTON, June 23.â The contem
plated conference on the isthmian canal
bill led to considerable comment to-dajr.
on the outcome of this important meas
ure. There is no doubt that the House
conferees will at the outset make strenu
ous insistence on the Nicaragua route, as
provided by the House bill.
Hepburn and Davey are earnestly In
favor of the Nicaragua route, and they
undoubtedly will stand by the House bill
as long as there is any possibility of its
selection. On the other hand, Fletcher of
Minnesota considers the Panama route
better than the Nicaragua, although he
thinks fuller investigation has shown the
Darien route better than either of the
others. . However, as the present legisla
tive issue appears to be confined to a
choice between Nicaragua and Panama,
Fletcher probably will cast his influence
for the latter. â¢ â¢ .. '

Report of Number of Uniform
Knights Who Will Be Here in
A.ugust. ,
Accompanying the Knights of Pythias
who are to be here during the month of
August to- attend the session of th*e su
preme body will be, in addition to the su
preme body of the uniform rank of the
order, and .'. the highest body of the
Knights of the Dramatic Order of Khor
assan, the offlcA-s and representatives of
the Rathbone Sisters, the ladies' auxil
iary of the order, of which Mrs. Dell
Phillips Glazier is the supreme chief. Mrs.
Glazier is a* resident of Kort Madison,
Iowa, and is said to be an unusually able
executive' officer, remarkably well versed
in oarliamentary law. The ladies of 'this
branch of Pythianisnvhave already out
lined a plan to be carried out during their
stay in this city. Committees will en
tertain the ladies wh/> shall accompany
the Knights, and thes'e have arranged for
receptions, parties, balls, excursions, and
the distribution of flowers and fruit to be
furnished them from a number of the
counties?" -
Â¦ Supreme Keeper of Records and Seal
R. L. C. White, who recently visited this
city in connection with the approaching
session of the Supreme Lodge, in a let
ter to a member of the general committee
in this city writes that the Knights all
over the United States are particularly
interested in the trip to San Francisco
next August; that more than 12,000 mem
bers of the Uniform Rank have already
registered for the California trip and that
every one of them will appear in the mon
ster parade. He is of the 6pinion that
SOOO : more i will be registered .before the
end of July.
It is ' expected that at the lowest esti^
mate there will be 100,000 strangers in San
Francisco during the Pythian week . and
it has been calculated that each -will spend
on an. average $3 per day, which will make
$300,000 a day, and at: the rate for seven
days the total amount of money that the
strangers will leave in this city-will be

OWING-io the high price of beef and the'gen
eral clamor against the meat trust more at
tention has been given than would other
wise have been accorded to a report, of W. H. Wiley,
chief of the Bureau of Chemistry of the Department
of Agriculture, on the relative values \)f various kinds
of foods. There is nothing particularly novel in his
statements. The world has been" told over and over
that there are lots of foods better than beef as well
as cheaper. In times past, however, the average
American has given little heed to such statements.
Things are different now. Chief Wiley does not
speak more eloquently nor more authoritatively than
some other folks on the subject, but the ears of the
people are more attentive, because this time the
pocket as well as' the stomach is interested.
We have-not seen a complete copy of the report
of the chief, but a summary is given out, for the press
quotes him as saying that only. 25 per cent or the
total weight of meat purchased is of any nutritive
value; that even if it were all nutritive and a man
got his money's worth out of all meat he pays for,:
its use would still be inexpedient, at breakfast, at any
rate, and might be profitably dispensed at lunch.
The chief is quoted as saying: "In so far as actual
nourishment is concerned the very cheapest and best
that can be secured is presented by the cereals, viz.,
Indian corn, wheat, oats, rye, rice, etc. These bodies
contain all the nourishment necessary to supply the -
waste of the body arid the energy and heat necessary
to all animal functions and hard labor, in a form well
fluted to digestion, and capable' riot only of maintain
ing the body : in a perfect condition, but also; of fur
nishing the energy necessary to the hardest, kind of
manual labor. .The; waste material in cereals is very
small, and, as compared with that in meats, practi
cally none at all. In fact, the ordinary wastes, such
as the bran and germ, are among the most nutritive
components of the cereals, and both! health and
economy would be conserved as a rule by their con
sumption, instead of rejecting them, a ; s in the ordin
ary processes of milling.'-'- ,;Â¦ ' r r
The world, has v heard that wisdom before, but this
time it is doubly valuable. It affords a means of,
bringing the proud beef barons to terms. Let the
Eastern people as one man take to cornstarch and
vegetables. Things will then be them
and very unhealthy for the trust. The experiment is
worth trying,- and now that i the East is , so' earnestly
discussing the cereal philosophy it* is to be hoped
her people will live up to it/ r >.- '/; â¢â¢'*','
ACCORDING to Santos Dumont the problem
of aerial voyaging is much nearer solution
than most people imagine. He"says men talk
about aerial navigation now as they talked of auto
mobile locomotion ten- years ago, "believing they
were predicting the future without suspecting that
they, spoke of the present."- .He asserts that the
..practical use of airships will not be delayed until the
coming of some future generation, but will be at
ained within a time comparatively short.
As to the merits of airships' formed of balloons as
compared wifh flying machines or aeroplanes he de
clares himself in favor of the former, but points out
that his own airship i^ a combination of the two. It
has a balloon structure, but is nevertheless heavier
than air. It rises only because of the force supplied
by the propeller, and when the propeller ceases the
ship descends to the earth by its own weight.
In the current number of the North American Re
view he gives an elaborate presentation of the sub
ject and argues that with a little further improve-!
ment in the way of diminished weight and increased'
power of propulsion the. flying-ship will be accom
plished.
He says: "I am persuaded that the airship, thanks
to the hydrogen (carried in the balloon), will always
have an advantage over the aeroplane in being able
to. carry a great quantity of combustible material for
long journeys, a number of travelers and a consid
erable weight of merchandiseâ an advantage that
will give it a practical utility unquestionably' superior
in commerce and in war. On the other hand, the
flying machine will without doubt attain for short
distances an incomparable/ speed, the advantages of
which will be in certain cases very appreciable.
* * *. But when I think that an airship of the
length of the trans- Atlantic 'steamer Deutschland,
constructed with the proportions of my No. 6, would
transport a thousand voyagers of my own weight
with a sufficiently powerful motor and the necessary
amount of petroleum, from New York to Havre in
two days, I cannot help finding the dirigible balloon
more interesting than .the aeroplane from an
economic point' of view, which is the dominant one
in the world to-day."*
â¢ With the spirit of a true enthusiast Santos Dumont
declares that aerial voyaging will " soon . be " accom
plishecfTf only mankind would take more interest in
it. He says he knows of a dozen petroleum balloons
owned by men rich enough to make aerial experi
ments, and yet they will not enter competitions and
thus help to excite public, interest. He announces
an intention to appeal to the world . through maga
zines and books, and says: "I shall hot be content
till every person is an aeronaut, either in airships or
in- aeroplanes." It is a big undertaking, but not
necessarily a vain one. Meantime the advocates of
the aeroplane are working as diligently to perfect a
flying machine as Santos .Dumont is / to perfect : an
airship. He -has therefore enough competition to
keep his enthusiasm at fever â¢ heat, and the' world
waits expectantly ready to applaud the winncr-

Criticizes Action of Gage.
Where was Governor Gage libeled and
where should he be most anxious to se
cure a vindication? The Call, which was
the ( head libeler, is published and largely
circulated In San Francisco. It is not be
lieved that it has a large circulation in
San Pedro, Los Angeles County, for none
of the San Francisco papers have. The
Chronicle, the chief assistant libeler, is
also a San Francisco paper, and the
Times is published in Los Angeles. ]t
might be logical to prosecute the Times
in San Pedro, but we can see neither
logic nor wit in the decision of the Gov
ernor to seek his vindication from San
Francisco ,slander in the little seaside
town on the southern coast. As we un
derstand it, the Governor's object in
prosecuting is to prove to all the people
that he has been falsely vilified, and
we should suppose he would seek to do
this in the largest forum in the State,
not in a hole or a corner, other words!

AIRSHIP DEVELOPMENT.
REPORTS from Rome concerning the negoti
ations with the Vatican for the purpose of
purchasing the lands now held by the friars
in the Philippines are encouraging, but vague. It is
announced that the Cardinals appointed by the Pope
to I act for the church are in agreement with
Governor Taft on all' essential pbints, but that
there arc wide differences on matters of detail.
Neither side has given out any intimation of the na
ture of the issues on which the differences occur,
but it is probable the question of the amount to be
paid for the lands constitutes one of the subjects of
disagreement, as a report from -Washington some
time ago announced that our .Government estimates
the value of the lands at about $7,000,000, while the
church estimate is not less than $10,000,000. . ,
Another cause of difficulty in reaching an agree
ment is probably to be found in the character of the
credentials given to. Governor Taft. He has not
gone to Rome as an accredited Minister from this
country, but simply as an agent to negotiate a busi
ness matter. In the instructions given to the Gov
ernor it is expressly stated: "Your errand will not
be in any sense diplomatic in its nature, but will
be purely a business matter of negotiation by you as
Governor of the Philippines for the purchase of
property from the owners thereof, and the settlement
of land titles in such a manner as to contribute to
the best interests of the people of the islands." â¢
Even in the restricted sense of a business agent the
Governor has not full liberty of action, for whatever
he does must be subject to action by Congress. Thus
the Governor is instructed "to take up the subject
tentatively with the ecclesiastical superiors, %ho
must ultimately determine the friars' course of con
duct, and endeavor to reach at least a basis of nego
tiation along lines which will be satisfactory to them
and to the Philippine government, accompanied by
a full' understanding on both sides of the facts and
the views and purposes of the parties to the negotia
tion, so that when Congress shall have_ acted the
business may proceed to conclusion without delay."
The measure is one of the highest importance to
the people of the Philippines and to ourselves. In a
recent statement as to the provisions of the Philip
pine bill on the subject Senator Lodge said: "It
provides adequate and comprehensive land laws,
which have been wofully lacking during and since
the time Spain lost supremacy there. Under the
laws of Spain there was no such thing as a title to
land. The occupants of the land exercised no owner
ship of it, and as a result they were constantly in a
state of turmoil. Of the 72,000,000 acres of land
there only 5,000,000 acres were held by private indi
viduals. The remaining 68,000,000 acres were held by
Spain. Under this bill homesteads of forty acres
each are to be given to the natives, and .they will
have a clear title to the land. The 450,000 acres of
land which the friars hold, which is the best agricul
tural land on the islands, is to be purchased, and this
is to be disposed of to those who now occupy these
lands. This must necessarily bring about better con
ditions in the way of wages to the Filipinos and in
other .important respects."
There is little doubt that Congress will agree to
terms that may be found satisfactory to the church
and to the Philippine government. Hardly any
thing we could do will more potently conduce to the
welfare of the islands than settling land titles and
giving the industrious and thrifty among tne people
a chance to establish homes of their own upon lands
that are theirs in fee simple. It is also in the interest
of the friars to get rid of the lands, which they can
not profitably use -under present conditions. Such
being the case, it can be readily believed that the two
parties arc already agreed upon the essential points of
the negotiation. The land will be sold, theÂ» United
States will guarantee the payment, and the old strife
between the Filipinos 'and the friars will end
amicably and in a manner beneficial to all concerned.'
PHILIPPINE LAND VALUES.
Professor J. C. Merriam of the depart
ment of geolotry said that he did not care
to go on record as stating positively that
the phenomenon was due ,to Pelee's
ashes, but asserted that suchVwas very
possible.
"In such violent eruptions as the recent
one in Martinique," said he, "the vol
canic dust or scoria rises to an enormous
height, so high, in fact, as to be above
the air currents of the lower air strata.
This ash; being of very light weight, is
not influenced much by gravity, and re
mains suspended high in the air for long
periods of time."
Professor Merriam cited the instance
of the eruption of Mount Krakatoa, in
Sumatra, when the volcanic ash was car
ried completely around the earth and re
mained suspended in the air for more
than a year.
"Only two things could bring about this
appearance of a circle about- the sun
either the presence of; mpistwre in the
higher strata of air or the presence of
some very finq material, such as volcanic
dust or ash. During the present dry con
dition of the atmosphere it" is scarcely
credible that there can.be much moisture
in the air, hence it is doubtless the ashes
which are producing the ring about the
sun. The same cause also would bring
about a very fiery red sunset. We have
been expecting such sunsets for some
time. The trade winds, which have been
blowing steadily from east to west during
the last month, together with the revolu
tion of the earth, would bring <is within
the zone of the volcanic ash."
â¢Dr. Tracy Crawford, fellow in astron
omy and assistant at the students' ob
servatory, had the following explanation
to give concerning the phenomenon:
BERKELEY, June 23.â Considerable
comment was caused to-day by the phe
nomenon of a large circle appearing
around the sun when it had reached its
meridian at noontime to-day, and much
speculation has-been indulged in as to
the cause of the occurrence. The opinion
of university professors, who are calcu
iated to know about such appearances,
is that the spectacle is due to the pres
ence in the air of fine volcanic dust from
the volcano of Mont Pelee.

Forecaster McAdle of the Weather Bu
reau declines to think that the phenome
non was a celestial warning of impe'nd
ing calamity. He says that It is very un
usual to . see so perfect a halo, but that
there are records of many less striking
spectacles of a similar character. The
halo had a radius of 22 degrees. It is
said to have been caused by the refrac
tion of light by ice 'crystals in the vale
of cirro-stratus clouds â a combination of
the light fleecy and the layer-like clouds.
Scientists attributed the extraordinary
heat* in the Eastern. States a few years
ago to disturbances on the sun's surface.
A similar appearance to that witnessed
here yesterday and one which was ob
servable all .over the world in the summer
of 1889 was said to be due to the fact that
the earth was passing through a haze oc
casioned by-Infinitesimal particles of mat
ter left in space as a result of the de
struction of the asteroids.
Science and history both furnish the
warrant for the idea that solar influences
occasion terrestrial disturbances. Lytto:i,
in the "Last Days of Pompeii," tells of
the peculiar appearance of the sun before
the -eruption of Vesuvius, as do also the
letters of Pliny. It is related that the sun
appeared dull and heavy* and was sur
rounded with 'a. ring just before the Mar
tinique disaster. It is a legend in Sicily
that the sun caused terror to people in
the vicinity a few days prior to the time
when Stromboli of the Lipari Islands
reared its head above the Mediterranean.
The followers of Zoroaster direct the
courses of their lives by the appearance
of the sun .and moon. Throughout all
history it has been - customary to take
warning from solar phenomena.
Solar Â¦ halos are not very unusual. So
perfect a one as that observable here yes
terday is, however, remarkable. The phe
nomenon is frequently seen in the tropics
and in the southern hemisphere, but or
dinarily rather indistinctly. Such appear
ances are. considered- by- savage races and
ithe superstitious portion of civilized peo
-ples as portents of : volcanic eruptions,
earthquakes, terrible storms, or some
other great disaster.
"What does it mean?" "Is it a sign' of
a cyclone or an earthquake?" "I never
saw anything like that before." Such
and other similar expressions were onjthe
lips of every one when the great solar"
halo appeared in the skies early yesterday
afternoon.: In appearance it was an im
mense ' ring surrounding the sun and
seemed to have a circumference about fif
teen times greater than that of the source
of light. No two persons could agree on
its color. Some said brown, others black,
and still others declared it was exactly
like a rainbow. The phenomenon was
first observed at about noon. Its effect
was mo3t pronounced at a quarter after
one o'clock. During the afternoon it fad
ed gradually and .was. barely perceptible
toward sundown. ' . .

Coil says he sleeps a great deal. He
attributes his longevity and excellent

years old, but rarely smoked. He, has
never been sick a day in his life; fe en
joying good health at present; his eye
sight is almost perfect and his hearing
is excellent; he is able to get around

reputation or improve his political chances by having a judicial- inquiry into the truth 01
falseness. of the statements published by The Gall in connection with the violations of
law at . San ' Quentin, he has now an opportunity to obtain tjiat benefit without delay: â¢
He can give to the public no satisfactory reason for shirking the issue raised by
the latest arrest of the defendants, nor for seeking to evade a trial in San Francisco. He
may select any court he chooses to hear the^case. The defendants will interpose no ob
jection. They ask for nothing but a prompt trial and a fair and full hearing of all J:he
evidence. . ' ~" J
The second arrest is annoying, but is not without compensating advantages. It
brings the suit at a place where there will be no difficulty in proceeding at once to trial.
The defendants are here, the witnesses are here and the prison records' and documents
can be readily brought here. There is but one doubtful; phase in the case and that is
involved in the question whether Gage will come to the front and make. a straight fight,
or whether he will anew shift, shirk, dodge and try to fly' to a court where a speedy
trial is not obtainable.
The. sentimental considerations that led the Governor to seek at San Pedro a bath
for his reputation, which he alleges to have been soiled, should now give way to consider
ations of another kind. He asserts that he has been libeled, maligned and' injured by the
defendants; he declares he cannot be satisfied by a civil suit, but desires to have them
punished as criminals; he avows that he wishes the trial to be held promptly so that he
can get a vindication in court in time to submit it to the Republican State Convention,
before which he is to go as a candidate, for a renomination.. Upon such assertions,
declarations and avowals the defendants offer him the opportunity he says he so much
desires. They are ready to go forward with the trial at once. v .
Governor Gage must bear in mind that his is not the only reputation that is at
stake in this issue. The charges made in his complaint against the proprietor and the
manager of The Call are false and malicious. Had they emanated from any other than a
discredited man, or been published in any other form than a court document/ they
would constitute a valid basis for criminal libel against himself. Having made such
charges he is called upon to meet the issue. If he now shirk a trial he will not
only exhibit a consciousness of the falseness of his charges, but reveal in his make-up a
There is another phasef of the issue that is not to be overlooked. So far as
the statements concerning the frauds at San Quentin affect 'Gage at all, they -affect him
in his official capacity as Governor of California. Even\upon his own allegations, it is not
his private but his official reputation that is at stake. It is therefore a strange proceeding on
his" part to run away from his official residence at Sacramento, where the prison re
ports are on file, and endeavor to get the case heard in a remote town, where it is
doubtful if all the witnesses and documents in the case could be brought until after
months of waiting. : -
Finally, it is to be borne in mind that the issue transcends private interests and
affects the politics and the property, of the State. - The frauds at San Quentin, whose
exposure the Governor -asserts has affected his reputation, are matters that concern all
the people of California. The public, therefore, has a right to demand that a full inves
tigation be made and a full hearing be had before a judicial tribunal. Moreover,, the voters
have a right to demand that the inquiry be made before the'approaching gubernatorial
campaign opens.
The defendants in the case recognize the right of the public^to ; a full knowledge
of all the facts. They are eager for an investigation. They have sought to obtain one
from the start. They urged the State Board of Prison Directors to make, one; and in
'the hope that such would be the case they suspended for a time further publication in
The Call of the facts in the case. It was not until the board showed signs of evading an
inquiry, and the Governor was detected removing public documents and making an in
quiry of his own, secretly, that The Call resumed the task of exposing the frauds. Now
again the defendants come forward asking and demanding a trial.
We repeat then: the issue has\ been made up, the defendants are ready. Is

Park and Outdoor Association
San Francisco Branch of American
Advances RapidlyX
Reports made yesterday at the weekly
meeting of the San Francisco branch of
the American Park and Outdoor Associa
tion, held in the rooms of the California
Club, show that much work has been done
of late. The members of the society, who
are workins for the beautincatlon of the
schools and other public buildings of San
Francisco, have chosen three schoolhouses
âthe Lafayette, Rincon Grammar and
Mission Highâ as objects of adornment.
Photographs of these three structures
taken by Professor Michel of the Girla'
High School and plans drawn by. P. S.
Barbour have been sent to W. Manning
and O. C. Simmons of Chicago, who will
make the final designs, which. will be
sent here, to be followed out by the so
society.
Tho society has also formed a commit
tee to locate the most desolate part of
the city, for the purpose of beautifying
and improving the same. The work being
cone is meeting with the approval of the
Mayor, Park Commissioners and 'School
Directors.
Assessor Dodge informed the Board of
Supervisors yesterday that this year's as
sessment roll would aggregate at least
$420,000,000. This will make sure certain
appropriations made for sewer and street
work on the assumption that the roll
would be in excess of $405,000,000. Dodge
filed the following statement:
Gentlemen of the Board of Supervisors: I
appreciate fully the difficulty which your board
has had to contend with, that is: To provide
for a more expensive government under the
charter with a restricted rate of taxation,
namely, the dollar rate. I am aware, If some
others are not, that the appropriations made by
your Honorable Board for running expenses are
practically no greater this year than they have
been for the last two years, and I am aware
ot the fact that you have less available for
public improvements this year, because . you
have no surplus revenue from an increased as
sessment roll to expend for these improvements,
as has* been the case for the last two years.
Knowing these facts, I have endeavored by
every means in my power to assist you In your
financial troubles. â¢ Â¦ - Â¦ '.
It is with no small degree of pleasure that I
find that 1 can now assure you of a roll of at
least $420,000,000. This is $7,000,000 in excess
ot last year's roll, and will place at your dis
posal at a conservative estimate at least $80,000
more than you have counted on having. I am
enabled to give you this estimate at this early
date, two weeks ahead of the time that it has
ever been possible to make it before, for the
reason that I was allowed by your Honorable
Board this year $t$000 for extra help. Regard
ing this help, I can further say that without it
I would have had no such surplus. This brings
me to the consideration of the same extra ap
propriation for the coming- fiscal year. I I now
ask you, gentlemen, to restore to the budget
this appropriation of $8000, which you made,
and which his Honor has vetoed, with the ex
planation that the money could be provided
later on from the urgent necessity fund if
needed. I know that it is needed, and I know
further that the money may not be in the ur
gent necessity fund later on, and further that'
this fund is not intended to meet such ex
penditures. With this appropriation assured
to me I can promise to give this board the total
of the roll next' year, when you first consider
the budget, several weeks earlier than this date.
You will then have tiie advantage of knowing
what surplus revenue yiu will have available.
This will overcome the embarrassing fact that
you must otherwise fix your appropriation be
fore you know what you have to spend.
Dodge explained that there would be a
possible delinquency of $8,000,000, including'
that of three big corporations, .which
would make an actual collection of taxes
on $412,000,000, giving $70,000 additional for
improvements.
cause they were deemed too -high, and the
clerk was directed to readvertise lor pro
posals. Supervisor Payot wanted the
resolution on the subject sent back to
the Printing Committee, but Supervisor
Wynn objected. .
"The committee has already carefully
considered the bids," said wynn, "and"
we found the prices too high. It did not
desire to present these contractors with a
silver crowbar with which to break into
the city treasury, and we therefore rec
ommended that their bids be rejected." â¢
BIIXS FINALLY PASSED.
The following ordinances were finally
passed:
- Granting the Santa Fe Railway Company
permission to build at its own expense a steel
drawbridge across Channel street at the foot
ol Third, to cost $70,000.
Requiring the reporting of chicken pox to
the Health Ofnce.
Providing for the full acceptance of Twenty
fourth street, between Castro and Diamond.
Authorizing the Board of Works to expend
$2000 to complete the -construction of the ex
tension of the Army-etreet sewer from San
Bruno avenue to Islais Creek.
. Granting the Commercial Pacific Cable Com
pany a franchise to maintain an underground
conduit from Forty-seventh avenue to its office

Charles E. Vannatta,. superintendent,
regular force and office/boy of the Van
natta Detective Agency, the office of
waich is at 4024 Twenty-third street, is
being sued for divorce by his wife. Van
natta, in his capacity of private detec
tive, had ferreted out evidence that has
assisted many an Ill-mated pair In gain
ing a separation, but he will scarcely
need to search for evidence in this case
In her complaint Mrs. Vannatta
charges her husband with having treated
her with extreme cruelty and with having
threatened her life, besides using vulgar
language in addressing her on several
occasions. But these are not her more
serious accusations. She accuses him of
having deserted her for another wema
and states that that woman is Miss Edith
Plerson, her own sister. She avers that
her husband and Miss Plerson cohabited
in a house on Ellis street, and in several
other localities.
When seen last night Mrs. Vannatta
told a pitiable tale of ill-treatment and
neglect. She said that Vannatta and her
self were wedded in Chicago in 1896 and
that at thatitime he was assistant super
rntendent of the Pinkerton Detective
Agency. For a year they lived happily
together and she invited her sister to
come and share their felicity. It was then
she claims that her troubles commenced.
Her husband became enamored with the
sister's charms and lavished all his affec
tions on her. - :
When Vannatta received the appoint
ment to the office of superintendent of
the Pinkerton Agency , in this city Miss
Edith Plerson was Invited to accompany
him and bis wife here. OC her experience
'.n this city Mrs. Vannatta has the fol
lowing to say:
The past two years has been like a long con
tinued nightmare to me. Both my sister, who
is five years younger than I am, and my hus
band, have treated me most cruelly. < He has
lived with her right in my own house and has
remained locked in a room with her for houw
at a time. I was left at home to do all the
work while he took her to French dinners and
to theaters. For two years I have worn the
same dress, while he dressed her in the height
of style. I was scarcely ever seen with him
on the street, but she was always with him.
Daring this month he told one that he was
going to Santa Cruz on a business trip but I
subsequently learned that he had arranged to
meet my sister there. He hired a room for
her in a hotel and' frequently visited her I
have begged my sister not to come between me
and my husband, but she would not listen to
me. When she went with him to Santa Cruz
she gave up a good position which she held
out in the Western Addition. I promised my
sister that if she would let me have my hus
band I would forgive her. It was only after
I had decided | to commence suit that I wrote
to our mother, telling her what kind of a girl
my sister had turned out to be. My sister has
broken up my home. ,
Vannatta has not been connected with
the Pinkertons since about two years ago
when the agency demanded his resigna
tion. Since that time he has been'con
ducting a private agency aTnd had his of
lice In his residence. .
Wife of Detective Van
natta Is Seeking
Divorce. \
THE Board of Supervisors by a
unanimous vote, as required by
the charter, finally passed the
two ordinances levying a special
tax of IVz cents on every $100 of
assessed valuation for new schoolhouses
and 7% cents for a new City and County
Hospital yesterday. Before action was
taken It was necessary to take a recess of
nearly one hour and a half to give Super
visor Sanderson, who had left his sickbed
to cast his vote, an opportunity to reach
the assembly room.
While waiting for Sanderson several
city officials were heard In regard to the
vetoes of tht yarious items in the budget
When Sanderson arrived he was carried
in a chair from his carriage to his desk,
and without any discussion the first ordi
nance, suspending the dollar limit of . the
charter to the extent of 7% cents to build
a new hospital, was read by title and put
to a vote by the Mayor. The roll was
called at once in order to detain Sander
son as little as possible, as it was plain to
see that he was a very sick man. One
after another the Supervisors answered
"Aye," and Sanderson's rolled out as
strong as the rest of them.
A DRAMATIC SCENE.
The scene was dramatic in the extreirf-e
and all eyes were centered on Sanderson,
who was braving the ordeal In good style,
surrounded by his attendants, who
watched his every move. It was stated
that Sanderson had experienced another
paralytic stroke while on his way to the
City Hall and a recurrence of it was
feared. When he was brought out of it he
was urged to go back home, but he reso
lutely ordered the carriage to drive on so
that he could record his vote in favor of
what he had deemed improvements of ex
treme urgency as contemplated by the
charter. \
No sooner had the Mayor announced
that the ordinance levying an extra tax of
7% cents for a new hospital had been
finally passed than the second ordinance,
imposing air additional' tax of 7^ cents to
purchase sites and to erect new school
houses, was put to a vote. Again the ayes
were told off by each Supervisor, and San
derson, who, during the preliminary skir
mish on both ordinances, had interposed
a mild opposition, voted with his fellows
and new schoolhouses were made a cer
tainty by the final passage of the second
ordinance.
After the result had been announced
Mayor Schmltz advanced to Sanderson
and chatted for a moment with him. In
the meantime Braunhart had taken the
chair and put the Mayor's veto of the va
rious items In the budget to a vote.

ADOPT SPECIAL LEVY FOR NEW
HOSPITAL AND SCH00LH0USES
The Board of Supervisors adopted a
resolution yesterday awarding the con
tract for lighting the public streets to the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Company.
The contract secures street lighting: for
321) nights, with the conditions that the
Board of Public Works Bhall designate
during the year the nights when illumina
tion is not required, not to exceed thirty
six In the year. This will insure practi
cally every-night lighting during the fog
gy and winter season, and an extension
of the system to the number of 100 new
gas lights and 50 arc lights. The rates
under this contract will be: For single
gas lamp per night, .087 cents; triple-top
gas lamps per night, 15 cents; arc lights
,per night, 37 cents.
These rates depend upon the increase
of twenty-nine nights lighted over the
old schedule, and will require the original
appropriation of $275,000. The contracts
for lighting the public buildings are not
fully prepared, there being some difficulty
in adjusting the rates upon certain- build
ings in the outside dictricts so as to com
ply with the charter provision restricting
the rates to the minimum charge of other
consumers.
The Mayor appointed Braunhart a
member of the Committee on Charter
Amendments, in place of Brandenstein,
resigned.
The petition of R. J. Curtln, W. I. Rear
dan and G. Varcoe, deputies in the Tax
Collector's office, that their salaries be
paid for a period, of time they were pre
vented from performing their duties, was
denied. â¢
ST. MARYS PARK FUND.
The ordinance authorizing the payment
of $25,000 out of St. Mary's Park fund to
J. \V. Goldstein and others to satisfy
judgments obtained in the condemnation
of their lands for park purposes was de
feated on final passage. Braunhart gave
notice of reconsideration at the next
meeting.
Ordinances were passed to print provid
ing for amendments to the charter pro
vision regarding the method to be fol
lowed in the acquisition of public utilities
or bonded improvements, so that all such
utilities or improvements may be submit
ted to the people at one election. One
amendment provides that in securing es
timates of the cost of original construc
tion of water works the Supervisors must
procure plans and estimates of the cost*
of obtaining from such sources as they
may designate as available a sufficient
supply of pure water for the city. Plans
and estimates of public utilities, these
, ordinances provide, shall be procured
only when the Supervisors determine to
acquire the same or when the electors
petition for the acquisition thereof, in
stead of overy two years, as now required
by the charter.
The San Francisco Retail Merchants'
Association submitted the draft of an or
dinance fixing the license to be paid by
drugstores where spirituous liquors are
sold at 52 per annum. It was referred to
j the License Committee.
CHARITY NOT TO BENEFIT.
The resolution requiring the payment of
55O00 to some charity by the club bring
ing: off the Jeffries-Fitzslmmons contest
\cas indefinitely postponed.
Connor objected to having money given
to charity through a boxing contest. He
contended that the club was giving up
enough as it was.
"Suppose one of these men should kill
the other, no charitable organization
would take the money," said Connor.
"There is no telling but we will have to
stop all these boxing contests at some
time, especially if any murder should re
sult."
Brandenstein held that the proper way
would be to increase the tax for boxing
contests to $5000 to help run the city gov
ernment.
The City Attorney was requested to
give his opinion as to whether the city

If your heart palpitates, flutters,
or you are short of breath, have
smothering spells, pain in left
side, shoulder or arm, you have
heart trouble and are liable to
drop dead any moment. "

try dropped dead from heart disease
recently, at his home In Portland, Ind..
while mowing his lawn.â The Prt&s.

CHICAGO. Jure - 23. â Grain bears were !
caught in a traa and were squeezed to the j
good profit of the bulls. Clearing weather In.
the wheat fields, as shown by the weather map
at the opening, augmented by lower cables, In
duced liberal early liquidation and short selling
of wheat. After last week's bullish arguments
on 'wet weather, followed by Saturday's break,
the bears thought the prices were much too
high for the fair, warm weather they had In
their mind for the harvests. The excitement
over wheat scarcity abroad seemed to have '
subsided and this gave the bears encourage
ment. Bulls who had paper profits that were <
threatened hastened to take them. As a result
July opened %@?ic to y 3 @%c down at 72%Â©>
73c. There were a few early bullish statistics
that were lost Bight of for a time, but soon the
crowd perceived that the pit was oversold.
Big increases, in stocks frightened the shorts
and the rest of the day the trade v/as busy
pushing prices up as the shorts cried for cover.
July worked up rapidly to 74V4@74%c with ap
parent ease. Buying was general. There was
a little dip from top prices on profit-taking,
but July closed strong, %c up at 74yi<g>74%c.
Corn was very nervous all day. Early in
the day there was marked artificial strength In
July options, caused by arbitrary high bids by
the bull leaders without considerable pur
chases. Fluctuations were /erratic. Too much
rain and cold weather has ben a bullish
factor in corn of late aiid in some sections of
the corn belt, especially in Iowa, these condl- '
tlons now prevail to some extent. In other
sections, however, crops are said to be in good
condition. July closed l%c up at C7c
Oats were strengthened by the advances Jn i
the other grains and by their own cash situa
tion. July closed firm, i,4c up, at 40%c.
Provisions again made top prices for the
year. Hogs sold at $7 85 at the yards, also the
year's record. Packers now hold almost every
thing in the pork list and yield up vnry little
of it. This condition naturally brought sharp
advances. July pork closed 32*Ac up. lard" 15c
up and ribs 12"4c higher. The cash demand
held up fairly well, but there seemed still to
be a strong manipulative aspect to the pit.
The leading futures ranged as follows:".

sale.

the river consisted chiefly of poor stock which
sold at the bottom quotations.
There was a steady Inquiry for choice de

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Eggs continued weak yesterday, though the i
arrivals were the lightest for a long time, fall- j
ing under 1000 cases. Stocks were lighter, owl |
ing, as already mentioned, to the decreasing !
receipts and the recent storing of the accum
ulated surplus. Some dealers quoted ISc as i
their highest Iprice, but the majority saw no
change from last week. The tendency is still
to sell, however. The market continues of a
midsummer character, or in other words, dull.
Butter opened the week at the closing quota
tions of the preceding week, with ample sup
plies on hand. There was no new feature vis
ible. The same rermarks apply to Cheese. '

Potatoes,. Onions and Vegetables.
Receipts of Potatoes were light yesterday,
but owing to 'the heavy accumulation of poor
stock during the past week the market con
tinued dull except for fancy stock, which was
in limited supply and commanded the usual
premium over the quotations.
Most of the receipts of red Onions were con
signed to one house and were firmly held at
the top quotation.
Offerings of Tomatoes and Cucumbers were
large and prices continued to weaken. Peas
and String Beans met with ready sale at sus
tained prices, some fancy String from Alameda
County selling at 3\i.c per lb. There was very
little Inquiry for Rhubarb or Asparagus and
offerings dragged. Summer Squash In large

of this gain was lost on the reaction.- . Among
the industrials Colorado Fuel was a conspicu
ous sufferer on account of the supposed dispute,
among insiders as to the continuance of divi
dends upon the stock. The recent heavy tone
of Amalgamated Copper also gave way to posi
tive weakness In view of the continued decline
in the price of copper and the unprecedented
production. Supporting orders seemed to be
withdrawn in United States Steel, and that
Mock suffered a net loss of nearly a point. It
is the general conviction in Wall street that
the proposed plan for conversion of preferred
stocks into 5 per cent bonds will be blocked
by the courts, thus -leaving no offset to the in
crease of fixed charges on the fifty million dol
lar new bond issue. There seems to be a fear
that the payment of dividends on the common
nocks is thus threatened. The reports of
minor labor troubles, while not directly affect-
Ing any special stocks, have a somewhat de
pressing effect on sentiment," and several re
ports of voluntary increases In wages instead
of ha\'lng a reassuring effect were taken as
pointing to the prevailing discontent of labor
with the present rate of pay. Saturday's un
satisfactory bank statement was borne in mind
Â¦to-day, and probably helped to repress specula
tion. The closing was easy at the considerable
reaction in railroad stocks. A number of the
lesa active stocks show large Â¦ losses. :
The bond market was moderately active and
irregular. Total sales, par value. $2,580,000.
United States new 4s declined 14 per cent on
the last call.

NEW YORK, June 23. â The dominating in
fluence of thp small rroTtssional operator wan
manifest in the tendency of prices of railroad
ftocks to react to a previous level. The only
trace of large speculative operations was In the
Gould group, led by the Wabash and Reading
Issues. The industrial department was weak
with the Vxfcption of one or two unimportant
stocks, and was under pressure of what looked
Ilk* eenutnÂ» liquidation. The buying of the
Wabash :s?ues was unexplained by any news
development. It came from the same source?
a> have iifpn active for some time past in this
troup of. stocks and represents the effort to
realize the improvements from the properties
through recent Â«-xtÂ«isions and new acquisition;.
The rtewn of the day Included a report of an ap
peal to a higher court of the city of Pittsburg's
ctH atair.st the entrance Into Pittsburgh by the
Wubach and an authorized Ktatement of the
project for a new railroad from Denver to Salt
Leke City with a proposed railroad to Los An
geles. This project Is avowedly Intended as a
con-.iÂ»ctitor to the Western extensions <jf the
Gould system. But. the large buying or the
various Could stocks was not checked in any
degree by this news. St. Louis-Southwestern
preferred, which has usually moved In coin
puny with the Gould stocks, was decidedly re-"
actlonary. This wae the more conspicuous In
view of the further rise of 7 points in Chicago
Blid J^ns-tern Illinois, supposed to be net aside
for absorption In the lnten.-t>t of St. Louis-

THE sad news was received in the
city yesterday that Theodore
Goodman Hosmer, a popular
young student of Stanford Uni
versity, had died on Sunday at
Wawona.
The young man was nearly 21 years of
age and had a promising future. He was
just entering the junior class at college.
He was attacked with appendicitis while
in the Yosemite and was taken to the
hotel at Wawona. Dr. Gardner of the
Southern Pacific was summoned from
this city and decided that an operation
was necessary. The young man passed
away soon after this operation.
J. A. Hosmer, who holds a responsible
position in" the general passenger office
of the Southern Pacific, was the father
of the deceased, and General Passenger
Agent T. H. Goodman of the same com
pany was his uncle. ''.
Last evening a number of friends of the
deceased left for Wawona and will escort
the body to Palo Alto, where the funeral
will take place, possibly on Thursday.
A pathetic Incident of the young man's
death is the fact that his mother, who Is
journeying from the East,, is not aware of
it. T. H. Goodman left last evening to
meet Mrs. Hosmer at Truckee and inform
her of the bereavement.

kins Art Institute..
The work of art was purchased by Jo

to "have the object d'art shown elsewhere
than within the walls of the institute. -
The statue, which is life size and fun

which is of Carrara marble, is lightly
draped and is holding aloft a goblet while

"It Is useless to use fire, now that the
pests have wings," he said. " The only
thing to do Is to use poison. I have found
that bran and molasses and arsenic, makes
a mixture that kills them Quickly. â¢

BERKELEY, June 23.â After much de
bating to-night the Town Trustees passed
the Santa Fe franchise to print. Tfca
clause over which the dispute arose was
finally compromised as follows:
Six young men, all natives of the
State of California, received the sacra- |
n'ent of holy orders yesterday morn
ing at St. Dominic's Church at Â¦ 7:30
o'clock. Archbishop Riordan performed the
ceremony and he was attended by the
Rev. Fathers Dempsey and Ramm. The
Rev. Fathers Welch, Wilson and O'Danlel,
represented the Dominican order at the
altar.
Three of the young men took major or
ders and three minor orders. Those made
subdeacons were Brother Bertrand Clyno
of Benicia and Brother Humbert Kelly
and Brother Andrew Hunt of Sari Fran
cisco. Those ordained to the minor order
were Brother Raphael Corcoran of 'Val
lejo and Brother Basil Kenny and Brother
Antonious Lewis of this city.
This morning at 7 o'clock at the same
church the three former brothers will be
raised by the Archbishop to the rank of
deacons and on Wednesday they will be
ordained to the priesthood.
Next Monday morning at 11 o'clock
Brother Humbert Kelly will, as a Do
minican father, celebrate his first mass at
St. Dominic's Church. This being his
birthplace, it is expected that a large
number of his friends will attend the sac
rament. He will be assisted by Father
Wilson as deacon and Father Clancy as
subdeacon. Father Driscoll; will preach
the sermon on this occasion.
Brother Clyne, who will also be a priest
at the same time, will journey to' Benicia
and celebrate his first mass there on Sun
day morning at 10:30 o'clock. He will be
assisted by Father O'Daniel as deacon
and Brother Antonious Lewis as subdea
con. Father Welch will preach the. ser
mon. ...
Brother Hunt will celebrate his first
mass Sunday at Vallejo at 10:30 a. m.
Father Lamb will act as deacon on .tho
altar and Brother Raphael Corcoran will
be subdeacon. Father O'Neil will preach
the sermon at Vallejo. - . Â¦ .
Under the rules of the Dominican order
it takes six years of continual Study be
fore a candidate is eligible to become a
Dominican father.
Emil Nusbaurner, who is getting the
credit for compiling those incriminating
affidavits against Assessor Dalton and
Editor Daniels, was a witness before the
Grand Jury td-dav. Mr. Nusbaumer talk
ed right out in meeting and didn't mind
telling all about it afterward. Here are
some of the things he says he said:
"You know anything goes before a
Grand Jury. They take all kind of hear
say testimony and if a fellow feela like
making a stump speech' it's all right. So
I made my stump speech.
"They asked me if I knew what be
came of those missing books, and I told
them I didn't know, but that if they
wanted my opinion I would give it. Then,
without any invitation, I proceeded to tell
them that I was pretty . certain there
never were any books to miss and that
Daniels and Dalton got the money for
them.
"They asked me if I was instrumental
in bringing about these charges, and I
said to them: 'Just imagine your worst
enemy and then think of all the venom
that you have stored up against him for
years, and you will have some idea of
my position. These fellows have been
attacking me ruthlessly, brutally, unnec
essarily and I resent it." That is what I
said."
W. S. Warren of the circulating de
partment of the Enquirer and E. B. Jor
dan, the assistant cashier of that paper,
were immaterial witnesses this morning.
M. de L. Hadley was recalled this after
noon to finish his testimony.- The Inves
tigation went over until Wednesday. . .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, June 23. .
Secretary Shaw is at present in Chi
cago. Secretary Shaw and the President
will doubtless consider these matters, but
the Secretary has not yet filled General
Sr-iulding's place. It only pays $4500 a.
yea:, so that it is oirficult to' get a hlgh
clasrs man for the position.
In consequence of the decision of Gen
eral Spaulding importers who were en
gaged in the deception on the Govern
ment went even so far as to demand the
removal of Appraiser Wakeman by Presi
dent Roosevelt, and but for the fact that
competitors of an offending firm forced
an investigation and carried the case to
the President entirely independent of the
treasury officials the whole conspiracy
would have remained unexposed and
Wakeman would have appeared in the
light of a vexatious meddler.
The action of the Treasury Department
in definitely terminating the services of
General Spaulding as Assistant Secre
tary will doubtless be followed by other
changes. Secretary Shaw has old-fash
ioned notions as to these matters, and if
the Department of Justice cannot find
ground for prosecuting those who were
jointly responsible for what amounted al
most to a miscarriage of justice, he is
likely to endeavor to find grounds for
tlieir removal.
Spaulding sustained the Collector of the
Port at New York and was in turn sus
tained by the underlings of the Collector,
Solicitor of the Treasury, United States
District Attorney of New York, chief of
special agents and the whole shoal of
smaller fry.
General O. L. Spaulding, First Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury, has been defi
nitely notified by Secretary Shaw that he
i3 to retire. He will probably not again
exercise the functions of an assistant, tho
Secretary of the Treasury being at the
present time on a leave of absence. Gen
eral Spaulding has been in the customs
service for many years. He is a very ex
pert official, knowing all the intricate de
tails of tariffs and their application. His
position placed him in charge of all of the
intricate cases of disputed duties, and he,
as head of the customs division, opposed

Symptoms ; enlarged glands or tumors about the neck /g|S^,

skin eruptions upon different parts of the body show the Â»*^ "r*.

and stealthy disease~entrenches itself securely in the system and attacks
the bones and tissues, destroys the. red corpuscles of the blood, resulting in
white swelling, a pallid, waxy appearance of the skin, loss of strength and
a gradual wasting away of the body.
S. S. S. combines both purifying and tonic properties, and is guaran-

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
It was decided to-night that the Eng
lish varsity men should meet the Har
vard and Yale boxers July 1.
The .betting started at 5 to ;| on Wal
cott. The attendance for this fight was
small. â¢ : :
Joe Walcott, the colored pugilist, won
his fight with Tommy West of Brooklyn
for the welter-weight championship on
points. This contest was a disappoint
ment to the spectators at the National
Sporting Club, as it lacked the vigor
which has characterized thÂ« Â¦ previous
meetings of these two men. VWalcott
fought for the body and did a deal of ef
fective work. He was/quicker in his
movements than his opponent and had
West in a poor plight jjuef ore the conclu
sion of the second round. â¢ After this
round he improved and landed come se
vere jabs on Walcott's mouth. The two
men were repeatedly in holds and the
referee was compelled to separate them.
In the latter "stages of the light West
fought gamely, but to no purpose. The
negro was tiring him out and waiting for
a chance to get in a finishing punch. This
opening nejver came, the bout lasting the
full fifteen rounds, and at the end Wal
cott was an easy winner on points.
The pace was' terrific throughout the
contest and McFadden made a resolute
fight, but Jordan was always a shade
better on . points, and - the referee would
have decided in his favor even if he had
not landed a knockout: blow.
The bout was held in connection with
the coronation spring, tournament, and
the fighters afforded the habitues of the
club an opportunity to witness a flna
struggle.- Jordan, the Englishman, start
ed in a pronounced favorite. It was any
body's fight up to the tenth round, when
Jordan showed prominently with a series
of blows on McFadden's body. ' In the
twelfth â¢ round McFadden Â¦ knocked- ' the
Englishman down, but the latter arose
apparentty unhurt. After this Jordan in
dulged in some tremendous hitting, and
fifteen seconds before the close of the lit
teenth round he knocked McFadden .out
with a fine cross; which landed clean on
the point of the jaw. McFad.len was
still unconscious at the end of the full
count. : . â¢" . . â¢' â¢ Â¦

SOME CLEVER PEOPLE WHO
ARE ENTERTAINI2*G SAN
FRANCISCO PLAYGOERS.
And here comes In Pinero's usual big
third act. The scene between the mani
curist and Quex is simply breathless, the
play of character' upon character clever
to a degree, i He has his code of honor, as
foreign to hers as . chalk to cheese, and
i Inveigling herself into the position of
maid for the nonce, Sophy Is dis
covered at the keyhole of the- Duchess'
boudoir, where later, she. Is locked In by
Quex, who has sent the .Duchess to her
hostess 1 , room with a tale: of "nerves."
(Oh, horror!) a "nurserymaid," to where
the last curtain .leaves her peacefully re
posing on his psychic bosom. .
The story, of "The; Gay^Lord Quex" has
been told before. Briefly, it repeats thus.
The gay lord, the "wickedest man In Lon
don," has fallen deeply v in -love, for "the
first time in forty-eight years -of a mis
spent life, with a sweet and wholesome
young English girl. To win her he has
reformed â a simple matter, of \not doing
the thing he is. accustomed to v do. But
neither Rome ngr a new. reputation are
built in a day, and Quex. on his good be
havior, realizes the precarious tenure of
the difficult affection that the rirl -has
been coaxed and coerced into giving him.
Among those who disbelieve in him as a"
narrow-path finder is Sophy Fullgarney,
manicurist, and the foster sister of Muriel
Eden, the fiancee of Quex. Miss Fullgar
ney has been a ladies' maid and nursery
maid before reaching, her present exalted
altitude and is without any. troublesome
scruples as tb< spying, eavesdropping and
those other little conveniences for finding
out other people's business that are not
commonly made use of. Disliking Quex
heartily, and adoring Muriel as deeply,
Miss Fullgarney decides in her respecta
ble and impertinent mind that her dar
ling shall not marry, "that old villain,"
and with all her advantage of unscrupu
lousness sets about to entrap the 'very
vulnerable gentleman. She fails. Lord
Quex having been there before, in enticing
:him to kiss her, but does overhear. an ap
.pointment made between him and a senti
mental Duchess, who desires to take a
sentimental leave of her former lover, and
immediately places the worst construction
on the meeting.
An underground railway and a train of
cars flashing through a tunnel, in which
the. intended .victims of a heinous plot
are' bound to the track is, one ' of ;.the
thrilling features of "The Road to Ruin,"
produced at; the Central Theater last
evening. Â¦ . Earle. Brown impersonates Jack
Morton,: the. hero, acceptably. Elmer
Bcoth, in * the character of Issy . Cohen,
the Jew, madean excellent showing; and
â¢with .Miss Georgie Cooper scored the
Central.
"The Two Orphans," that ever popular
melodrama that draws tears from â¢, the
gallery and dress circle alike, opened the
week last night at the Grand Opera House
in a style. seldom equaled. The scene in
which the second act is laid, the gardens
of Belle Air, evoked the continued ap
plause of the delighted spectators. The
capacious : stage was a vision of beauty
with' its cool masses of greenery, the
play of moonlight on sparkltng fountains
and the varicolored lanterns swinging
among the trees like glow worms. Every
act in- the play was set with similar care
and thoroughness, and that was the way
in which . the piece ,was played, too.
Maude Fealy was am ideal ;. Louise in
voice,, in figure; and in action, there be
ing nothing overdone or underdone. in her
personation of the sympathetic character

Mr. Miller has in Quex an apt vehi
cle for the display of his various dis
tinctions, finish, subtlety, manner, and
the rest. Ho is most grateful to the part
and the part to him, and Pinero's re
formed lord would go far. to find a more
finished interpreter. Sir. ' Chichestei
Frayne, Quex's'- unreformed" friend, is
delightfully assumed by Lawrence D'Or
say. and Miss Eustace gives a highly sym
pathetic portrait of the Duchess. Grace
Elliston is pretty in the pretty role of
Muriel, and tho rest of the cast are all
competent. The piece. It need not be said,
is mounted splendidly, the garden scene
at Fauncey Court being a de luxe edition
of the kindf'of thing.
the contrast is stunningly effective. Both
finally reach a common ground, and are
betrayed into a mutual admiration that
is as esthetically grotesque as their for
mer dislike. The last act, that reads
rather dully after the third, acts delight
fuliy, and but' for a slight sag in the sec
ond act there is no. lag in the interest. .
One trembles for "The Gay Lord Quex"

belongs thechiefest honor of the- illusion,
for her completely convincing assumption
of the manicurist role, so radically out; of
key with anything in her former reper
toire.* She invested the part with a rich,
unconscious humor." a "snippy," . flippant,
smart, impudent, yet sound-hearted at
mosphere, that set Sophy before one with
the strong, droll line of a Phil May.
Her gesture, tone, glance, everything,
strengthened the illusion, and Miss An
glin's Fullgarney will go down as one of
the greatest comedy portraits of the pe

The Poliea Department expects to hear
daily from,.-many banks jn various parts
of the country with whom Black has had
transactions. When Black's room was
searched at the Palace Hotel many bank
books, showing names and accounts as
follows, were found:
Black still maintains absolute silence as
to his antecedents, and will not discuss
the charges against him. He has secure^
the services of three attorneys, and fre
quently consults with them. .
Bankers' Protective Association. The legal
representative of the banking association
stated that the police would seek for fur
ther evidence against Black, and when
it was produced the association would
take every step necessary to convict the
accused man.
A consultation, was held yesterday aft-*
erncon by District Attorney Byington,
Chief of Detectives Martin and Attorney
D. Y. Campbell, representing the National
comedy hit of the play. Fannie Mcln
tyre, as the heroine, did good work.
"The Road V Ruin" is a lurid melodrama,
replete with'. me scenic and electrical ef
fects. A packed house enjoyed it from
start to finish last 'night, and testified its
appreciation by frequent outbursts of ap
plause.
CONSULTATION IS HELD.
The complaints filed against Black by
Colonel Andrews of the Diamond Palace
and by Cashier Scott of the "Western Na
tional Bank were based on checks drawn
by the accused on the Bank of Santa
Clara. The checks drawn by Black were
returned and protested and complaint was
made to the police.
Black had deposited a genuine' draft
with the Santa Clara bank, but he was
requested by that institution not to draw
against the draft until word came from
the East that the document was good.
Black's haste to secure funds proved his
undoing. Before the Santa Clara bank
heard from the East, Black's checks were
presented and protested.
Word came from Indianapolis yesterday
that Black's- drafts deposited with the
Santa Clara .bank had been paid. Conse
quently Colonel Andrews and the "West
ern National bank will receive their mon
ey from the Santa Clara, bank on Black's
checks.'
The draft deposited by Black in the
name of A. Young, for the sum of $1000,
with the National Bank of Oakland, .has
been paid also. This draft was drawn on
.the National Bank' of Indianapolis in fa
vor of "J. B. Washington.'.'
The Oakland bank received advices yes
terday from the bank In Indianapolis
stating that while the draft was good,
there was something peculiar in the trans
action. The Indianapolis bank officials
stated that J "J. B. Washington" had
drawn b.ut one draft - against them and
that he had checks printed with his name
and also that of the Indianapolis bank as
hi& correspondent.'
From the Oakland Bank Black drew j
the :,sum of $600 by check, and deposited
the same with the Bank of California,
signing his name as "G. W. Pratt." Black
also deposited $1000 In cash with the Bank
of California, and subsequently drew all
the money out with the exception of $60.
In the faco of the genuine drafts depos
ited by Black the complaints filed against
him last week will : fall to the ground,
but the prisoner will not be given ills lib
erty. The police, of Springfield. Mass.,
want him for passing a forged check for
$385. â¢;â¢Â¦;, -
When Black was ..arrested Chief Witt
man-sent a number of telegrams to East
ern cities asking for information concern
ing the .prisoner. The police of Spring
field, Mass.. desired to send an officer aft
er.'Black with extradition papers, but
Chief Wittman replied that it was not
necessary, as Black could be held here on
the local charees.
As ; the local- charges may not stand.
Black will be held as a fugitive from jus
ticepending the arrival of extradition pa
pers from tho East. .
Chief Wittman and Captain of Detec
tives Martin are not afraid that Black
will secure his liberty simply because
some of his drafts have turned out to be
good. Â¦ -
A draft on a New York bank for $1100.
deposited with the Western National Bank
of this city, has been returned as being
worthless,, and Black will have to answer
to the charge of passing fictitious bank
ing documents.
CHECKS WILL BE PAID.
The' swift action of the police depart
ment of this city nipped in the bud the
daring schemes of the man of many
aliases. If he had not- been arrested last
week, .his- credit would have been good
with . many banking institutions in this
and other cities.
The payment of some of the drafts and
checks is looked upon by the police^ as
being a part of the plans of Black to
swindle banks all over the country. -Hav
ing once established his credit with a
bank. It would be an easy matter for
Black to deposit forged or worthless
drafts and checks and araw against them
before advice could be received from the
East. . :
Although information reached the police
yesterday that some of, the drafts and
checks deposited by Black in California
banks have been paid in the East since
his arrest. Captain of Detectives Martin
has every hope that Black will be given a
long term "in prison.
J. B. Black, alias Richard James, alias
John O. Stone, alias O. B. John and
known by a score or more of other names,
was arraigned before Judge Conlan yes
terday morning on charges of passing fic
titious checks. Owing to the absence of

the prisoner was -remanded until to-mor
