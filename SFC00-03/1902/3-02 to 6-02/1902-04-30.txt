WAf HINGTON, April 29.â In a signed
statement Professor Moore, Chief of the
Weather Bureau, says:
"It is difficult and oftentimes Impossible
to forecast for the Pacific Coast, because
xr? cannot ascertain the â¢weather condi
tions that prevail in the ccearj to tne
westward. Wireless telegraphy offers i
solution of the difficulty, and already ar
rangements are being made to
stations on" some of the near-by islands
of the Paclfio. Observers stationed on '
these islands will flash their observations
across the intervening waters to land
stations, and the information they contain
will enable the Weather Bureau to issuÂ»
warnings of fogs and weather changes
with a greater degree" of accuracy* The
observers on these Islands will also be
charged with the duty of reporting -ves
sels.for the benefit of commerce. Another
application of space telegraphy will be in
the warning of vessels at sea of danger
ous storms."
Reverting to tbÂ© Sandlco order. Senator
Patterson quoted from a report of Dr.
The witness could not recall a letter
of General Reeves, who was the Chief of
Police at Manila, in irhich he stated that
he did not believe a massacre was Intend
ed, because it was entirely contrary to
the manner in which the Filipinos had
wagred war in the past.
"With regard to the order for the Manila
massacre. General MacArthur, answering
further questions by Senator Patterson,
said the order he saw was signed by San
dico and not by Luna. General Mac-
Arthur detailed the efforts made by him
to ferret out Luna's connection with It.
"I am responsible In that matter In
every way and particular," said General
MaeArChur. "It is one of the deceptions
frequently practiced in war, and whatever
deception attaches thereto I take."

United States had acquired sovereignty
by treaty and in a. way owned thÂ« Phil

"We / know 'what the packers will tell
â¢him," said -a leading butcher^ to-day".
j'.'Let Crow come' to , us : and -we .will show 1
that there is no competition between the
packers in the Kansas City trade.' -"
There" are a number of ', butchers in
Kansas City under obligations to the
packing-houses "for credit' in the manner
described and- there â¢; are others who en
joy special favors from the packers by
other means and it will be difficult to get
them to'glve any ' explicit^ testimony. There
are many, others, however, who are bound
by no obligations and talk freely- on the
subject. By/ these it Is known ; that the
sales agents or. other representatives of
the packing-houses reach an agreement
every Saturday regarding the ; prices fthat
go into effect for the. following Monday.
The price,- sometimes, varies half a . cent
a' pound at thej different houses, but the
butchers assert that* when^th'ey order from
the houses quoting the' low price they, are
told that 'their â¢ orders cannot be, filled.

of .tho packers gef tips "on' Saturday after

KANSAS CITY, Hoi April 29.â Butchers
say that if Attorney" General Crow wants
evidence, to; sustain tho proceedings
against the beef trust. /which he instituted
yesterday, he should call on thfim and not
on the packers. : They declare they can
furnish him plenty. The strongest." evi
dence they have as to -the agreement, be
tween the packers is the uniformity of
the wholesale price of beef, at all the
houses; and in^fact that the rise in quota
tions takes place simultaneously on a cer
tain day of the week. .This is conclusive
ly ( shown by the bills ; rendered by the
packers. Another evidence ' cited' by the
butchers is. the blacklist system, under
which a. dealer .who misses the regular
weekly payment of his , bills to one pack
ing-house, is unable to buy any meat from
another until that-bill 1 is paid. While his
credit may be extended a short time at
the house to which he is obligated, he be
comes entirely "subject to that house in
the price he ; pays for meat. â¢

RAWLINS" EXPLANATION.
WASHINGTON. April 23.â A spirited
discussion of the Philippine situation oc
curred in the. Senate io-<3ay_ It revolved
around the order alleged to have been is
sued by General Jacob H. Smith to mak
the island of Samar. a howling wilderness
and to kill all the male inhabitants over
the age of 10 years. \
At the conclusion <>f routine business
Rawlins of Utah made a. personal state
ment as to a report of his speech made by
the Associated Press to the effect that he
had. in effect, characterized General
Chaffee as "a dastardly villain" on ac
count of the alleged -..barbarities com
mitted ln the Philippines. Rawlins said
'that an unintentional injustice had been
done him and quoted from his speech in
which he said:
â¢ "I am unable to fix the responsible head
and emanation of these -fearbaritles. which
would disgrace the annals pf even a seml-
Vivtlized country, not to speak of the na
tion which claims to" hold aloft the es
cutcheon of honor and Justice and fair
dealing. Did Chaffee, alone, unaided. In
coldness and in brutality and in savage
and unrelenting disregard of every hu
mane sentiment or possibility of human
suffering, conceive this iniquitous scheme?
Whenceâ from what diab*olical source wa6
it derived? The American people ought to
know. Is there any penalty beneath the
sun adequate enough to be meted out to
th*- dastardly villain who has thus
brought dishonor upon the American
army and the American people?"
Discussing the alleged order of General
Smith, Teller said he understood that
General Smith had tried to Justify his
order by what is known as the "Tom
Ewing order" during the Civil War. By
this order the population of two counties
in Missouri were deported and their prop
erty destroyed. He' was proceeding to
characterize "the action " of the American
army in the Philippines as most cruel and
barbarous when he was interrupted by
Spooner of t Wisconsin with the inquiry.
"Does the. Senator not remember Fort
.Pillow?" â¢
"What does the Senator mean by his
reference to Fort Pillow?" -Inquired* Car
mack of Tennessee,. â
"I had in mind," replied Spooner, "what
has been considered a massacre of col
ored.troops there." .
TELLER'S AMENDMENT.
Carmack insisted With some heat that
there was no massacre of troops or killing
ofprisoners at F-ort Pillow.
Teller was continuing his remarks about
General Smith's order when he was in
terrupted by Fairbanks.
"I do not understand," said he, "that
the Government approves of General
Smith's alleged order. A court-martial to
try General Smith was ordered as soon as
Information concerning the matter reach
ed Washington."
Teller replied that, according to a news
paper article he had read to the Senate,
the Information had been in Washing
ton many months, but he knew nothing
about the matter himself. I
Teller offered an amendment to. the
Philippine government bill, providing for
a commission, to be appointed by the
President and to consist of not less than
seven nor more than fifteen persons, to
proceed to the Philippines and to try to
secure a lasting peace between the
United States and the Filipinos, th6
United States to pay the commissioners
salaries of $10,000 a year and all expenses.
Teller said that if- it be true that Gen
eral Smith issued the alleged order, he
ought to be dismissed from the service.
"In the records of all ,the great wars
since the middle-ages," he declared, "you
cannot find such a disgraceful and wicked
order as that issued by General Smith."
Lodge said nothing was known here of
General Smith's order until It was pleaded
by Major Waller as a defense for his ac
tion ln Samar. As soon as Waller had
pleaded that order as his defense, the
President himself had decided that Gen
eral Smith be court-martialed. He said
he did not know whether the order of Gen
eral Smith was verbal or written.
Carmack of Tennessee insisted that the
evidence Indicated that^orders- of t ~a very
extreme character issued in the-Philip
pines were being suppressedâ not, i he be
lieved, by the War Department, but by
the military authorities in the Philippines.
In calling attention to the report of the
Secretary of the Batangas province, that
there had been bo great a mortality in the
province as to reduce the population from
300.000 to about 200,000. 'the mortality being
due to disease, Tillmah inquired whether
the Philippine Committee had Investi
gated that matter.
When informed that it had not, he ex
claimed: â¢ â¢ â¢

WASHINGTON. April 29.-Gunner
Charles Morgan of the navy has at last
succeeded in attaining the new commis
sioned grade of chief gunner. Morgan
was recently examined by a board of
chief gunners to determine his fitness for
promotion, and the board reported that
while he was mentally and professionally
qualified his general reputation was such
that his promotion could not be recom
mended on moral grounds. *
Secretary Long determined to give Mor
gan a second chance, and another board
was appointed to examine him. This
hoard has reported that Morgan Is men
tally, professionally and morally eligible,
and its recommendation that he be ad
vanced to the grade of chief gunner was
approved by Secretary Long to-day. -

The above Â¦ mentioned . railway lines
should be finished and exploited in strict
adherence to the agreement made be
tween Russia and Great, Britain on April
16, 1899. and to the , agreement made on
September 28, 1898, with a private com
pany with regard to- a- loan for the con

a continuation of railway lines in South
ern Manchuria or construction of branch
lines to them or erection of a bridge at
Inkoy or the remOvalotthe existing ter
minus of the railway;llne, all these ques
tions must previously be agreed upon' by
the Russian and Chinese Governments.
In consequence of the fact that the ex
pense incurred by the Russian Govern
ment for the construction and exploitation
of the railway, lines of Shanghai, Huan.
Inkoy, Slnmlntin were not included in
the total sum of damagesâ the Chinese
Government shall compensate the, same
after deliberating with the Russian Gov
ernment on the sum to be returned.".
DISPOSITION OF KAIL WAYS.
In view of the necessity of warding off
in ' future the possibility of a repetition
of the disorders in which Chinese troops
stationed in the provinces participated,
an agreement is to be reached as to the
strength and distribution of Chinese
troops in Manchuria until ' the province
has been evacuated. After complete evac
uation the Chinese Government "will have
the right to decide upon the strength of
the troops stationed in Manchuria, sub
ject to 'increase or decrease after timely
information of the Russian Government,
"as it is understood," to quote the article,
"that the maintenance of troops in undue
numbers in the above mentioned region
would immediately bring 1 about the in
Â¦cre'ase'pf Russian^ forces Iri-the neighbor

.curity within -the limits, of Manchuria of
all Russian subjects located. there and the
enterprises established by them. For
police service and the maintenance of or

the Chinese Eastern Railway, there will
.be formed exclusively of." subjects of the
Emperor of China a Chinese mounted and
foot police guard* at the local governor

Article IV of the treaty provides: "The
Russian Government consents to return
to the owners the railway lines of Shang
hai, Huan, Inkoy, Sinmlntin,- occupied and
protected by Russian troops from the be
ginning of September, 1900. In view of this
the Government of his Majesty-the Em
peror of . China, promises should there be
a necessity. of protecting, the above-men

posed uport the. Chinese Government alone.
No other. Government is to be invited to
take part In "the protection, construction

evacuated by the Russians."
OBLIGATIONS FOR CHINA.
Government officers say that this ar
ticle conclusively vindicates Russia of the
charges so .persistently circulated by the
European pressâ that she proposed to
maintain permanent sovereignty over
Manchuria. Russia agrees by the treaty
to evacuate Manchuria within eighteen
months, the first six months to withdraw
from the southwestern part of the Muk
den province; within the next six months,
the remaining part of Mukden province
and the province of Ghirin, and within
the following. six months the province of

WASHINGTON", April 23. â President
Havemeyer and other officials of tha
American Sugar Company will be asked
to appear and give testimony before thÂ«
sub-committee of the Senate Committee
on Relations -with Cuba, "appointed to in
quire into the question or Cuban sugar
holdings, and they will be the tlrst wit
nesses called.
- The sub-committee held its .first meeting
to-day with all the members of the com
mitteeâSenators Platt of Connecticut,
Burnham and Tellerâ present. The dis
cussion was a very general one, but no
definite result, beyond that of deciding to
call the trust officials, was reached. The
suggestion that they should be summoned
was made by Senator Platt. who said that
for obvious reasons the Inquiry should, be
gin with them. Senator Teller replied
that the proposition met with his entire
approval. No time was fixed for the next
meeting, but it was agreed that it should
take place as soon as the witnesses could
be secured. No names of other witnesses
were mentioned, but Senator Teller said
he -would from time to time make sugges
tions in that respect. He said he had no
very extended list and the opinion was
generally expressed that the investigation
would not be long-drawn unless men
should be summoned from Cuba, in which
case some time might be necessary to se
cure the persons wanted. The committee
has not decided whether any Cubans shall
be invited to attend, but Teller indicated
his purpose to press for their appearance.
Aiter the adjournment Senator Platt.
chairman of the committee, expressed the
opinion that the consideration of the reci
procity bill would not be delayed on ac
count of the proposed inquiry, but that
the committee would probably proceed
with it3 work independent of the investi
gation. .;.

Gentlemenâ In the summer. of 1S93. I -was taken violently 1IL My trouble be-
. ran with pain in my stomach and back, so severe that it seemed as if knives
were cutting me. I was treated by two of the best physicians in the county,
and consulted another. None of them suspected that the cause of my trouble
was kidney disease. They all told trie that I had cancer of the stomach, and
would die. I grew so weak that I could not walk any more than a child a
month old. and I only weighed sixty pounds. One day my brother saw ln a
paper your advertisement of Swamp-Uoot, the great kidney remedy. He bought
me a bottle at our drug store and I took It. My family could see a change in
me, for the better, so they obtained more and I continued the use of Swamp-
Root regularly. I was so weak and run down that it took considerable time
to build me up again. I am now well, thanks to Swamp-Root, and weigh US
pounds, and am keeping house for my husband and brother on a farm. Swamp-
Root cured me after the doctors had failed to do -me a particle of good.
(Gertrude Warner Scott.)
"Women f 6Uffer untold misery because the nature of their disease is not cor-
rectly understood; in many cases when doctoring they are led to believe that
â¢womb trouble or female weakness of some sort is responsible, for their ills,
when in fact disordered kidneys are the chief cause of their distressing troubles.

SAN JOSE, April 29.â The charges made
before the City Council last night by
Henry E. Miller, who accused Andrew J.
Mackenzie and other ' members* of the
Police and. Fire Commission of malfeas
ance in office, and asked forHhe removal
of Mackenzie, were sworn to -to-day by
Miller and formally filed with City Clerk
Cook by Attorney H. A. Hardinge. This
probably means an investigation, in ac
cordance with the City Council's resolu
tions of last night.- The. resolutions de
nounced Miller as an erratic and irre
sponsible person and contained a clause
with the proviso Â£hat the Council would
Investigate the charges "if sworn to by a

Fortunate Escape "of Trainmen in an
Accident Near Mill
Valley.
MILL VALLEY, April 29.â A wreck oc
curred on the North Shore Railroad, near
Mill Valley, this morning. ! Much damage
was done to the company's property and
the engineer and fireman both had narrow
escapes from death, but no passengers
were injured. The engine was overturned
and the smoking car went on top of it,
but fortunately there was no one in the
smBking car at the time. A defective
switch was the cause of the accident.
The train left Mill Valley for Sausalito
at 7:45 o'clock. It consisted of locomotive
No. 2 and three coaches. Conductor
Stein was in charge, Charles Stocker was
engineer and P. Begley fireman. Th<Â»
train had gained considerable speed, and,
when passing the Robert Dollar lumber
yard switch, the rails spread and the en
gine was hurled into the ditch. It over
turned and the smoker piled on top of it.
Engineer Stocker jumped to save him
self, but Fireman Begley went down with
the locomotive and had a narrow escape.
A re!ief train was sent from Sausalito
and the passengers were delayed only an
hour.

Mayor Martin and the Council make
light of the charges and denounce them
as malicious. The Mayor said that no
special meeting would be called > to con
sider them, but that they would be taken
up at the Council's meeting next Monday
night. . .
If the charges are true, the gamblers
were the main support of the California
Club. It is declared In the accusation
that they were assessed $25 a month and
sometirn.es as much as $400 a month was
carried to the California Club by Frank
Cheek, a saloon-keeper, who gave the
money to John D. Mackenzie. The Police
Commissioners are charged with having
known of this alleged system of black
mail.
According- to Miller, the money collected
from ; the . firemen â¢ was, deposited in- the
Commercial andhSavings Bank of this city
by. the men' who made the collections and
was subsequently drawn from the bank,
turned over to the Chief of the Fire De
partment and by him taken to. the Cali

Crone at once took legal steps to gain
the place to which Mayor Clark had ap
pointed him, bringing suit against the
members of the Board of Trustees to
compel them to recognize him as a rep
resentative from the Second Ward. The
suit v.'as heard by Judge Bennett of El
Dorado County, the Trustees contending
that there never had been any valid ad
judication of insanity, and that Kent's
absence from the city was with the per
mission of the board. Judge Bennett de
cided in line with this contention.
SACRAMENTO, April 29.â Robert E.
Kent was to-day Judicially declared en
titled to his seat as a member of the
Board of Trustees of Sacramento. The
proceeding which culminated in to-day's
decision by Superior Judge M. P. Ben
nett of El Dorado County was a remark
able one. Kent became afflicted with a
mental trouble which required his com
mitment to the State Asylum at Stockton.
After a few months had passed Mayor
Clark nominated John W. Crone to fill
the place on the Board of Trustees
which, he held, Kent's commitment to
an asylum had rendered vacant. When
Crone sought to take his seat he found
it occupied by Kent, who meanwhile had
procured his release at Stockton on the
ground that his commitment, in view of
a recent Supreme Court decision, was not
valid.

"I am not prepared to say. what caused

for me to say whether the showing in the
mine is such as to justify this 'bear' raid.
Any one may organize a 'bear' raid. It Is
possible in such cases that there may be
no reason from the mining point of view,
and, again, it may be a bluff which no one

The Leroi is the largest mine in British

$5,OU0,ou0. To-day its total value was but
VI ,000,000, which leaves a balance of $3,0oo,

It is said that the returns from ore sent
to the Northport smelter from the Leroi
lately have been lower than for any pre

grade ore has been handled. Besides, a
large number of men have been laid off dur
ing ihe last couple of days tor the reason
as given by the management, that copper
prices are too low to make the handling:
of that ore profitable. Nevertheless, it is
a fact Aha t copper has been low in 'price
for several months and there has been no
recent change in the market, as the lay
ing off of men to-day would seem indirect
ly to indicate. Bernard McDonald, former
manager of the Leroi, said to-day:

virate, said to-day of the Pennsylvania
decision in the Lajoie case: "The injunc

The Los Angeles* baseball team will

aggregation of talent, but whether or not
tfiey will play as good ball ' away/ from
home remains to be seen.
The local line-up will be changed a lit

hold down first, and Josh Reilly, whom
ManagerHarris has signed *or emergency
purposes, will chase a few in the vicinity
of second. Meredith will probably pitch
though Kane or Whalen may possibly act
ln A e few of the old. familiar faces will be
among the Angel contingent. Bill Han
lon, who played with Sacramento last
year, is stationed at the initial bag, and
Charley Reilly, last season's Los Angeles
captain, will resume his duties at tnira
base. Eddie Householder still gambols
on the green in center field, while old
Slowball McPartlin will be there with
his tactics, which aggravate batsmen and
spectators alike. Jones is also well known
in the local ball colony, but the rest of
the team is composed of imported talent.

The members of Golden Gate Park
Driving Association are making elaborate
preparations for their; annual race meet
ing, to be held at. Oakland track May 30.
At their meeting last night President
Edward Aigeltinger appointed a pro T
gramme committee consisting of M. M.
Donnelly, J. W. Bonney and Al Schwartz.
A printing committee made up of J. W.
iionney, Al. M.. Donnelly and F. W.
Thompson was also appointed.
The programme will include a 2:40 class
for horses that have never been raced, a
2:bO class and a 2:20 class. The*re will also
ue a race for the Frank G. O'Kane chal
lenge cup, now held by Henry Miller.
Tnere will be pari mutuel and' auction
pools tor tne betting men, who can thus
wager on the -outcome of a heat or of the
race. Admission will be free for ladles,
but men will -be charged twenty-five
cents. ' .
secretary Thompson was instructed to
write the Golden Gate Park Commission
ers, thanking them on behalf of the
horsemen for excluding automobiles from
the main driveway.
The horses from Aptos Stock Farm,
which A. B. Spreckels will- sell at Cleve
land. Ohio, late in May, are ""en route
East. They are in charge of . Sandy
Smith, who conditioned them, at Aptos.
The horses will be taken from the- cars
at Denver and rested one day. , The con
signment is pronounced the equal of any
t-at ever left this State, both 'for looks
and for speed prospects. The horses will
be driven regularly at Cleveland track,
where Intending purchasers may seethem
in action, thus knowing what they are
buying.
The American Kennel Club officials will
have a novel controversy to settle, which
developed during the recent dog show.
GL M. Carnochan, who came from New
York to judge fox-terriers, placed George
S. Thomas' wire-haired terrier ahead of
all the dogs of his class in the show.
After he had won everything for which
he was apparently eligible. Mr. Carnochan
purchased him for $5oO.
At the time of the sale neither buyer
nor seller thought of furtner competition.
The next day. However, the dog won the
â¢International trophy," a splendid bronze,
presented by Consul General Ho Yow for
the best dog in the show, irespective of
breed. '
As the owner of the dog when he won
the trophy, Mr. Carnochan claimed the
prize as his. It then developed that the
sale had not been consummated; 1:0 trans
fer having been made and no money paid
over. Mr. Oarnochan at once wrote his
check for the amount, but this did not
alter the status of the case.
The entry of the dog was in. the name
of Mr. Thomas and he was the only per
son the kennel club officers coVild recog
nize in the distribution of prizes. There
was some friendly bantering between Mr..
Thomas and Mr. Carnochan over the mat
ter and It is to be submitted to the gov
erning body in the East for adjustment.
This is the first case of the kind which
landers remember.
Although the street railway strike made
a comparative failure of the show, there
is no deficit to be made up. There will
also be a small balance available for char
itable purposes. Had conditions been nor
mal It is estimated there would have been
between $5000 and 510,0000 for distribution
among deserving charities.
The managers are far from being dis
heartened and stand ready to sponsor an
other show one year hence.

oeep-water ships have been arriving as
usual. When these ships left England,

which they sailwJ, their skippers were
provided with charts which told them
they would know San Francisco by the
lightship anchored outside the Golden
Gate. Fortunately for these mariners the
weather has been clear during No. 70*3
vacation and they have reached port
pafely by means of. other landmarks and
beacons and in spite of the gas buoy with
which the lighthouse authorities replaced
ihe lightship. An effort is being made to
secure an appropriation to build a substi
tute lightship which can be used on the

generally will breathe easier when No. 70

and Tells His Story.
The. Grand Jury yesterday completed its
investigations into the assault upon Thom

missed the case against Fred Hansted,
alias "Young Dutchy." Among the wit
nesses examined was Hansted, the alleged
perpetrator of the assault: The ' latter
was -sworn by Assistant District-Attor
ney Ash and instructed as to his rights.
Hansted simply. told the members of the
Grand'.'Jury . that -he +iad saved Editor
Garrett from being kicked, to death,. and
was arrested and abused, for his trouble.
He said 'he would be unable to answer
any- questions put to him by the Grand
Jury, -as '.he was advised by his attorney,
Archie Campbell, not to do so. He. fur
ther stated he was answering a charge of
felony in the Police Court;
, Billy Lyons, owner of a saloon on Post
street, in. front of which the assault took
place,, was subpenaed but was not called,
as 'he -was in bed at the time of the inci
dent. Chief of Police Wittman . and Sec
retary Cadwallader of the Police Commis
sion were examined. The Chief was asked
about. crime in this city. -He denied that
it was rampant, and by statistics showed
what; the; officers of the law -were doing
to suppress lawlessness.' . ,

It is still â¢ some time before registration will ;close;
but it is none the'jess just as weir to begin, reminding
citizens of their duty in that respect. v The bosses
will see to it ' that their men are.registeredj'.'>the
henchmen' of the corporations will get, every service-.

' The -delay invariably brings 'with it two evils. In
the first place if, citizens would register early they
would have little 1 or no difficulty .in 1 getting them
selves enrolled, but when they: wait until the last
week, or perhaps even the last day, there is of neces
sity a good 'deal of annoyance . caused by having , to
stand in : line wasting perhaps an hour at what could
have been done earlier in ten -minutes. ; In the sec
ond place when the delay is carried too far citizens
sometimes find it impossibleto register at' all, and
thus they lose the- franchise and the privilege of
having a voice ; in â¢ deciding' .what candidates shall â¢ be
elected. . :-iV.' '.". ' ' ; , '.'Â¦ Â¦.. Â¦. ' > Â¦'.:)
The delay in registration is far from being sur
prising/ Unfortunately the average American busi
ness man,: workingma'n rand professional man is so
much absorbed in his own affairs that he is prone to
neglect even the most primary of his public duties!
Every election year, whether the contest be national.
State or- local, furnishes .new 'Â¦â¢ illustrations of the
seeming indifference of the general public to' the
duty of registration. , 1 1 is not until the excitements
of the campaign are-under^way that, the attention of
citizens is given to the importance of, the subject:;The
result, is much the same year after year â a lagging
enrollment for months; and then a rush to enroll dur
ing, the closing, days of registration.
AT the meeting of the executive committee of
â¢ the Republican State Central Committee on
Monday evening Chairman Stone directed at
tention to the fact that registration, throughout the
State is progressing very slowly. While theenroil
ment has been in progress for; more than three
months it, is reported that in several: counties less
than 100 persons have, registered. ,'

It is well known that nothing makes a. .-more

hospitality, can excite" in his mind any 'Â¦Â¦ great adrnira-.

selves to cdnsiderable/expense^and; are ; to exert.our
best '; energies to ; the - entertainment " of f the '.visiting
Mystic Shriners and; ; Knights^ oH Pythias, : so-; we'
should attend, to the matter of; making "a clean r sweep
of our main Â¦thoroughfares as ' : a; part oV the i work ;'of ;
preparation. ; -" Â¦
Before all that political sweeping be
gins and the phrase loses its force let us talk business
awhile on the advisability of making a # literal clean"
sweep of the thoroughfares of San Francisco by. way.
.of! preparation for, the coming of the 'many, thousand
visitors to our. city 'during the summer. ;â¢:,.; ; -
That the streets of San Francisco arc m'uchicleaner
than: they were in days gone by: is indisputable! We
have , got past the silurian age and > our principal
thoroughfares are 119 longer: foul.: Still theyare a
long way from being as clean as" they should b'e)-
When the summer^vinds- blow.: about: the town' for
the cooling of the air ;- and ; the "refreshment : [ of the"
Eastern Â¦ : fugitives ; from . thel sweltering^ torridity' of.
the Mississippi and the Atlantic Statesthey : will carry
a good deal-of dust witli them if'there be not much
better clean. sweeping than is done now. ;
AS election times are coming on there is going
to be a good depl of talk throughout the'
. country of "clean sweep." Republicans are'
going to exhort one another to make a sweep ofthe
whole country, Democrats will try to make a sweep
of a State or two, and even the populists, fu'sionists'
and independents will get out -brooms more or less
new and make a vigorous effort to sweep a county or
perhaps even a Congressional district.
A CLEAN SWEEP.
The American flag is worrying the manipulators
of the British merchant marine. Our British cou
sins should congratulate themselves that the flag ap
pears on a mission of peace, prosperity and profit, or
the worry, mights be more serious than that which
now attaches to any reference -to South. African af
fairs. ; Â¦ "
While the situation is thus far from reassuring, the
executive committee deserves credit for leading off
in the fight for open primaries. It is a, step in the
right direction and gives encouragement to those
who are demanding that the right be conceded to
every Republican to' have' a vote and a voice in the
selection of the delegates who are to nominate the
State ticket. The action of the committee tends
toward the ultimate harmony of the party, which is
threatened only by the effort of Billy Herrin, a Demo
crat, to force the rcnomination of Gage. If now the
rank and file see to it that the recommendation be
followed in every locality the prospects will be bright
for the nomination of a ticket that will sweep the
State and aid in bringing about victory v in every
county. , Â¦*'Â¦Â¦-
It is hardly necessary to point out that while the
following of the bosses is not numerically strong,
the combination is nevertheless a formidable one.
The corporation has called to the aid of Gage all
its henchmen of both camps. Even where primaries
are held there will be a fight made for Gage by a
combination of the Democratic with .the Republican
"push." In short, the corporation forces are thor
oughly organized and thoroughly unscrupulous.
Very little will they care for a recommendation of
the State Central Committee if they can see any
chance of advantage by .setting it aside, and unless
the rank and file of the party be vigilant and reso
lute a good many Republicans may have the morti
fication of seeing themselves misrepresented in the
State convention by iÂ»Pichine delegates appointed to
obey Herrin and vote for Gage.
That the bosses, who, under the direction of Billy
Herrin, are making the fight for Gage, will accept
the recommendations without a struggle is not to be
expected. They are working for delegates who will
take orders, and they will not hesitate to resort to
trickery to obtain them. They are well aware they
have but little chance to elect their men at primaries,
and accordingly will have delegates appointed wher
ever they can.
While this first step toward the attainment 'of
honest primaries is gratifying, it will not do for the
rank and file of the party to depend too much upon
it for ultimate victory. Neither the executive com
mittee nor the State Central Committee can do any
thing more than make recommendations on the sub
ject. It will remain with "the local authorities of the
party to choose delegates by any means they may
designate, and the final decision as to the validity of
the choice rests with the State convention itself.
What has been accomplished, therefore, is but little
more than a victory on the skirmish line and the
main battle is yet to be fought.
The special committee may be relied upon to carry
out the instructions. There is every reason to be
lieve that at least a majority of its members are in
favor of primaries and would have recommended
them even without instructions, As it is, it is probable
there will be a unanimity of sentiment on the sub
ject and the desired recommendation will be duly
and strongly made.
BY the executive committee of the Republican
State Central Committee the first step has
been taken to assure every genuine Republi
can a right to a rote in the selection of delegates to
the State convention. A special committee of five
has been appointed, to which Chairman Stone was
added, to prepare for submission to the general com
mittee a call for a State convention and such.resolu
tions as it may deem advisable, and it was instructed
to include in its call a recommendation that all dele
gates to the State convention be elected at open pri
maries.

DEATH SUMMONS
NOTED PIONEER
OF CALIFORNIA
At the : close of the meeting President
"White announced the appointment of the
following committees: .-' . Â¦ ;
Rev. 1 L.M. Walters of Fresno, first vice
president, delivered an address entitled
"Go Teachâ Respond Quickly to. the 'Call.''
He said the international Sunday-school
system "was inaugurated in 1S73 and at the
close of that year had a membership of
5,00<f,000. In thirty years its scope had ex
tendedto all parts of the world, and now
it numbered 25,000,000. "It is planted," he
said, "in! every country,: in every mission
post and every school district, and it is
the advance guard'; of 'church cl.viliza
tipn.""â¢::. : . . 5i-' . 1 '. ' .*;
, Rev. A. B. Banks of Sacramento made
a brief, and humorous response, in which
he referred to the hospitality of the peo
ple of ! San Francisco' as exemplified in the
reception accorded to the delegates to the
Christian Endeavor, Epworth League and
the present conventions. . â¢.. â¢
CITY IS HOSPITABLE.
: Sf we must realize that we have to develop
the Sunday school.- which is the very vital part
of . cur v church; The Sunday school, enhances
popular â¢ education and the morality of tho
reople. j The Brele Is out. of the public schools
and it is probably out to. stay. Then how are
you going to grasp the problem of morality If
we 'do not teach . the Bible in . the Sunday
school? We have either to teach morality to
the pupil of the public schools through the
medium of the Sunday school or else put a po
lice officer upon him as a safety valve.
Th* Sunday school Is as old as the history
"bf the church. All the leaders of Christianity
favored them and ursed-, their establishment,
the ereat heretic in the first century,
eald:- "Destroy the school, for if the youth
of the land are educated, our cause .can make
no headway." _ Martin Luther, the ' Jesuit?,
John Wesley and other noted religious ", leaders
favored the establishment of the Sunday school.
After the singing of the hymn "Onward,
Christian, 'Soldiers," Rev. W. M. : White
opened the exercises with a brief address.
He said that he was extremely sorry that
Mayor. Schmitz, who was*to deliver the
address of welcome on' behalf of the city,
was not present, having been . detained
by a press of . municipal business. In the
Mayor's place he Introduced Rev. F. . M.
Larkin of Grace Methodist Episcopal
Church/ who delivered the welcome on
the part of the churches. . He said in part:

Surely it is high time for the people of the United
States to put a stop _tO' this defiance of law. Either
the Interstate Commerce Commission should be
given power to enforce its rulings or it should be
abolished. ItJs up to Congress. to act,. and the peo
ple should see to it that the action is taken promptly.'
That is the situation. "The railroads' ignore the
commission, the courts and the public. . It is not
merely that a comparatively small city like Los An
geles is, unfairly treated, but even so great a city as
Chicago is wronged. The defiance runs not only
against the minor tribunals of the> country, but the
Supreme Court itself is mocked.
This defiance of the law and the courts is hot a'
thing- of to-day only. It has been going on for some
time! _Â¦Â¦ In the report submitted to Congress last Jan
uary,, the. In terstatec Commerce Commission ; said:
"It ' s is not A the business 1 of., this .commission
to enforce .the. \ anti-trust, n 'act,\ and. we express
no opinion - as t!o, the legality of the means
adopted by these associations.' We ' simply
call attention to the fact that the decisions in the
United States Supreme Court in the trans-Missouri
and Joint Traffic' Asspciation cases have produced no
practical effect upon the railway operations â¢ of the
country. Such associations,' m fact, exist ; now as
they' did before those decisions and with the same
general effect."
It is probably quite true that Mr. Hill was correct
in saying the decision of the United States Supreme
Court would have no effect whatever upon his com
pany.; Whether his "acts are legal or illegal makes no
difference. He is as sure of his ability to defy the
court as President Ripley is: to defy the Interstate
Commerce Commission.
Another recent incident is pertinent to the issue.
Only a few days ago President Hill of the,; Great
Northern was asked what would be the effect "if the
Supreme Court enjoined the merger planned by the
Northern Securities Company, and replied: "It makes
not the slightest difference to, us, not the slightest.
We own the properties now, and whether we control
them in one form or another doesn't make much dif
ference. It's something of a fashion, just like the
coat you wear may be cut in' three or. four different
ways, and still be a coat.- If the courts should finally
decide against the securities company it would hurt
people interested in other railroad corporations, but
it would not affect us." . '
On the very day that President Ripley in Los An
geles was; expressing: his .intention to appeal to' the
courts the merchants and manufacturers of Chicago
joined in making representations of unfair, discrimi
nations on the part of the railroads centering in that
city. The charges made by the complainants are
probably true, since 'they; are made by a body of re
sponsible men, and yet those roads' have been spe
cifically enjoined. v by. the courts from making such
discriminations. The roads -therefore have not only
violated the law, but have violated the injunction and
are in contempt of court. .- :.-
On the face of "it that refusal Â¦ to \ comply ' with the
ruling of the commission until the courts have. passed
upon it seems fair enough. It dismisses the "com
mission, indeed, as a body! of no authority, but it,in
timates a willingness to obey the, courts^ If any con
fidence could- be placed in th<r apparent respect for
the courts all : would be well, .bill, unfortunately, no
such confidence can exist;'" The great railroad man
agers ha-ve in repeated* instances, paid no more at
tentioh-to the- courts "than, toi the commission.
REPORTS from Los ; Angeles are to the effect
that the officials ' of â¢ the . Santa Fe road will
not comply with the recent ruling of the Iri
terstate Commerce Commission that railroads must
make .shipments by â¢ whatever ; routes the shipper : se
lects. 'President Ripley of the Santa Fe/ who is "now
in Los "Angeles, is quoted as saying: "Our course in
regard to the . ruling of the ; Interstate Commerce
Commission in the citrus fruit case will depend on
what the lawyers advise. T '. do not expect we will
comply, with the. ruling, but we wilt let the '/courts
decide whether we.: are right or : the shippers are
right."-' '..- " Â¦/Â¦ .' "., 7 'Â¦Â¦ ' , 'Â¦ ':Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦Â¦.-â¢ ' .:Â¦Â¦.., v
RAILROADS AND THE LAW.
Upon this the followers of the prophet of Lincoln
take their stand and refuse to budge. 1 And it was for
this that Bryan unhitched his horse. ;
Then this call to arms proceeds to denounce the
courts, call attention to Bryan's exclusive ownership
of the Declaration of Independence, and then, seem
ing to see David Q. Hill again, runs at him like a dog
with a collar does at the pound wagon. With its
finger on the public pulse and with the furred tongue
of the United States under its inspection, this Bryan
crowd prescribes for the patient a dose of initiative
and referendum, to alternate when' the patient is
awake with popular election of Federal Judges and
Senators, to be followed with "liberal pensions of
faithful public servants Who retire from age." With
all this the patient is to take a bath in a Government
ownership of all utilities, and, as a soporific, the
single tax.
This piatform re-enacts those of 1896 and 1900,
upon which Chairman Jones won the greatest vic
tories ever, won before election in the history of
American politics. Upon the platform of 1896 he
carried every. State in the Union except Vermont,
and in 1900 had hopes of that. These victories were
won in August and September, and the, merit \of
those two platforms is -that they got in' and woh'ih'
huckleberry time' and before the first frost,, while the
Republicans had to wait till November before they
carried a single State. 'We think tKeJJryan men are
wise in not parting with those platforms.- They are
like a family totem to a Siwash Indian â they mean
much. â¢:. : ;*'
Having given a good licking to these offenders the
Bryan Democracy proceeds to adopt a platform, and
any fellow not standing on it, or even seen loafing
near the ,edge where it would be easy to jump off,
is ruled out, cannot be a delegate, and if caught vot
ing the ticket will find the finger of scorn loaded and
aimed at him.
The offense of Tammany is that it has entered
into social relations with Mr. Hill and has returned
bis* calls. For this Tammany is stripped of war
paint and feathers and the sachems and wiskinskies
are treated as if they, were just reservation Tndians
and not big braves at all.
A convention is called to meet in New York June.
7 to nominate a full Bryan State ticket, and candi
dates for ! Congress and local offices. The call for
this convention hops on to David B. Hill and makes
him look as if he had been attacked by a company of
buzz-saws. His record since 1894 is overhauled, -and
by no means for repairs, but to make them neces
sary. If he is left* uncccused of any political crime
it is because it was like parricide among the Greeks
â never \heard of. Tammany, the new Tammany,
the disinfected, vaccinated and just-out-of-quarantine
Tammany, then comes in for a roast which rises to
the dimensions of a barbecue, and the scent' of its tor
ment is detected as fcr as the smell of burning gar
bage in the valley of Hinnom. .
Then appeared Colonel Bryan on the scene. He
looked over the load and failed to find free silver, or
the platforms of 1896 and 1900, or a copy of his
"First Battle," or even an issue 'of the Commoner.
There was no pledge to celebrate his birthday or do
any other thing to keep him* or his memory green.
Then. Bryan was mad. He proceeded at first to
abuse everybody from Watterson to Hill who hitched
the team and loaded the wagon, and then -took: off.
his coat and unhitched his silver horse from the
wagon and rode him off, leaving the gold nag
whinnying for his mate. As a result there are two
Democracies. The effort to v hitch up in harmony
began in New York, and theVe it ended. -The Bryan
Democrats have come out utterly and set up for
themselves, and their missionaries are out promoting
the movement in the Middle and Western States.
EVER since 1900 the divided Democrats have
been trying to get together. The two wings
were exactly like t\yo balky horses pulling or
refusing to pull the same load. When one wants to
go the other doesn't, and so they wear out the
whiff] e-trees, one by backing, when the other goes
ahead. However,- since the high; harmony dinner of
the Manhattan Club the two nags' seemed to be" so
far in accord as both to balk at once. This was such
an improvement that hope ran high. Both crowds
stood neck and neck, '^neither pulling a pound, but
standing still at the same time. The like of it had
not been seen since 1892, when they were both pull
ing together. This was the first time they had agreed
upon anything, and, "iilthough it was an agreement to
balk in harmony, it was something.

was held originally by H. Lorraine, who
assigned it to Edwards, who was a
stenographer in the employ of the Board
of Public Works under the name of R. F.
Elllston. His failure to appear yester
day to prosecute the suit led to an in
vestigation, which developed the fact
that Edwards or Elllston had not been

LIST OF INVITED GUESTS.
Harriman has already shown a^ tend
ency to consider the interests' of the peo
ple of California in the short period dur-.
ing which he has controlled the affairs of
the Southern Pacific. It is hoped that
this' event will tend to cement and
strengthen the good feeling which has
risen on both - sides. The banquet will
take place in the American dining-room,
which will be decorated very elaborately.
George A. Newhail, president of the
Chamber of Commerce, will act as toast
master. On Newhall's right President
Harriman will sit and on his left Mayor
Schmitz. The two most important toasts
of the evening will be responded to by
Harriman as president of the Southern
Pacific and by Gavin AIcNab as the rep
resentative of the commercial Interests of
the State. Other toasts will be respond
ed to by President David Starr Jordan of
Stanford University, Benjamin ! Ide
Wheeler of the University of California,
Julius Kruttschnitt, George W. McNear.
Andrea Sbarboro. Frank J. Symmes, Wil
liam Sproule. William A. Bissell and Gen
eral W. H. L. Barnes.
On Mr. Newhall's right and left, in
what are the seats of especial honor, the
following named gentlemen, aside from
those already mentioned, have been ac
corded places by the committee in charge
of arrangemepts: T. C. Frledlander, J.
A. Pilcher, E. Scott, Frank Dillingham.

man as president of the Southern Pacific
can exercise enormous power toward tho
development of the West. It is felt that
the railroad has not always acted bene
ficially for this section of the country.
Since the . beginning of the new regime
the representatives of development and
commerce have been very desirous of in
augurating an era of good feeling with
transportation ; interests. â¢ Harnman's
visit to this city seems the accepted time.
Accordingly the feast of honor has been
arranged that the great, railroad man
may hecome acquainted with and' appre

of this State.. ,

. Tho banquet .theoretically represents , the
good feeling Â§ of ; the commercial men
toward the famous railroad king. Lead
ers in the professions, capitalists, public
officials, the- presidents of the State's
great universities, and in short most of
the greatest and most representative men
of California will be present. In scanning
the list of guests, about three hundred- in
number, the absence of the name of the
State's chief executive is conspicuous. 63

The commercial men of San Francisco
have completed all arrangements for the
grand banquet they , are to tender to
President B. H. Harrimsrh of the South
ern Pacific at the Palace Hotel to-night.
California's prominent j men in' all of the
more important .walks of life have been
invited to the feast, which it is hoped
will mark the beginning of a new era in
the commercial ; prosperity of the ; State.
Preparations; for the , affair . have \ been
made in the ..most elaborate manner
throughout. 1 Â¦-. ;
Doubtless your honorable body is familiar
with the principles of law governing the cases
here in question as well as with the . position
of the municipality in relation thereto. Your
statement that the recommendation you make
is a compromise one does not, for that reason,
entitle it to any other than an â¢ impartial and
respectful consideration, nor warrant any other
determination than that which existing con
ditions lend lecal support to. since It Is the
purpose of this board to perform its official
duties regardless of any proposition Involving
a limitation to the performance of such duties.
If there be any lesal -obligation on the part
of the municipality to>remove fences which are
now maintained on portions of the streets in
the said district, notwithstanding the unim
proved and naturally rugged surfaces of such
streets which render them unsafe for vehicular
travel ' and such obllcatlon is declared by a
court of competent Jurisdiction, then this board
will willlncly obey Its mandate and cause the
removal of such fences. . .
As to the opening . ol Thirty-fourth and
Thirty-flfth - avenues. ; between K street and
Railroad avenue, this board deems that - thÂ«
removal or the fences; on the easterly line of
K, street.' where said avenues Intersect it, to
be at the present time inadvisable, since .they
serve as barriers to protect the ...traveling pub
lic from the dangerous chasm which - extends
through the roadways of K ' street and ' said
avenues at said intersections. . : Instead of re
moving said fences --now Â¦ serving as barriers
this board, as the result of an investigation
by Commissioner Casey 'and upon his' recom
mendation in the premises.) regards it essential
to the protection of . vehicular ( travel j to have
erected and maintained fences on the westerly
line of said K. street, where.it intersects said
avenues,' until' such time as said ' street and
avenues are graded and- otherwise improved
at the expense of owners of the property liable
therefor, as provided I in the . charter, or until
bridges are constructed | by such owners "of a
good and substantial . character and approved
by this board. Meanwhile, for the accommoda
tion of persons on foot, turnstiles will be built
and maintained at suitable locations, provided,
however, that substantial foot bridges with
proper euards be constructed across the said
chasm In K street by property owners.
Â¦ In reply this board begs to inform your
honorable body that : It will, at the earlkst
practicable date have a survey made of the
block. in which the South End School is. located
and ; of the streets surrounding the said S block,
and from which survey it -will be enabled' to
nx the official lines of the said streets. -When
these lines are definitely determined this board
can intelligently and .effectively proceed to
cause ' the said streets to be opened to the
official widths thereof and. thereby preclude the
probability of future controversies relative to
the extent of encroachments thereon.; . .
The Board of Public Works senfa'caus-'
tic reply yesterday .to the Grand Jury,
which had previously [requested- that" the
evils existing in the'' University Mound
and - Bay '< View districts . be remedied ; by
opening 'Thirty-fourth andi Thirty-fifth
avenues; between K and Railroad, and the
streets bounding the block in which the
South End School is 'located. The com
munication says: ...
Says Fences Serve as Frptec
tion to the Traveling
'Public.
Feast Is Aimed â¢ to Promote
a Feeling of Mutual
Friendship.

the offerings being soft and muddy. Receipts

checked the local demand and there was little
Inquiry for shipping. Lftrge sizes were espe

STOCK MARKET.
Nezv York Stock Market.
NEW TORK, April 29. â The movements of
prices -were "confused and irregular all day
and there was evidence of a diminishing specu
lative Interest. The wide movements. in lilgh
prlped stocks- continued a feature-, but the in
fluence of the advances was impaired by some
equally notable relapses In stocks where at
tempts were made to take profits. A case- in
point was that of New York. New Haven and
Hartford, which fell violently 9 points on an
attempt to' market a .email amount of the
stock because of the emphatic disclaimers from
both Pennsylvania and New York Central au
thorities of the rumors of purchase of control.
There was a late rally of several points In the
stock. New York Central and Pennsylvania
also quieted down from their recent activity
and strength. In fact, there was very little
yhow of strength throughout the Eastern rail
road field. The session of the Joint â¢ commit
tee of operators and miners to discuss disputed
points in the anthracite field was a repressive
influence on all coalere. The decrease reported
in Reading surplus earnings for March was
an unfavorable influence. The very heavy de
crease In net earnings of the Southern Railway
for March was certainly not a stimulating In
fluence, although it was accounted for largely
by the notable Increase in operating expenses.
The Western railroads, on the other hand, were
benefited by the crop news and by the weekly
crop bulletin of the weather report, which was
considered very favorable, not only regarding
the condition of winter wheat, but as to the
progress in seeding corn and spring wheat. The
grain-carrying railroads also were helped by
the complete strength of the Northwestern
stocks, which rose 10% and 6*4 respectively.
Rock Island gained an extreme 5%, but 'lost'
over 2 points of It. The strength of the Wa
basb stocks and of the .Wheeling and Lake
Erie stocks was evidently due to the apparent
certainty that the bid of the syndicate repre
senting the Gould interest for the Western
Maryland will be accepted. The industrials
were marked by quite as great irregularity a*
the railroads and changes there were constant
and variable. A further . advance in the for
eign market and a drop in the rate of sterling
at Paris both contributed to narrow the mar
gin mill remaining from the gold export point.
The money market, however, was still undis
turbed.
The bond market maintained a firm tone to
day. Total sales, $-'{,770,000. Â¦ v
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last 'call.

residing at 1919 Haste street, and Miss
Kate Johnson, daughter, of Mrs.' P. John
son of -.Ward ;; and-:- Sacramento j streets,
have been missing since Saturday morn
ing. They left, here for San Francisco on
an' early train that day and have not
been heard from since.
Attorney Riordan stated that he was
in a position to say that at least some
of the signatures were appended to the
petition only at the request 6f Barendt.
and not because the subscriber had any
objection to the saloon or the manner in
which it was conducted. He said he
would be able to prove this statement
when the case came up . for' hearing.
Commissioner Hutton warned the ;Â¦ re
porter that it would be necessary to pro
duce the witnesses -in person when the
case was called* as the petition would be
of no value as evidence. '
Â¦Commissioner Mahoney suggested that
Sergeant Gleason of the license office file
charges against Lyons, but the sergeant
demurred because he- said he did not
know what charge to bring. After con
siderable discussion Barendt was allowed
to read his petition and it was filed in
the nature of a charge. Lyons was given
two weeks to prepare a. defense.
Arthur Barendt, a reporter for the Ex
aminer, appeared before the Police Com
mission last night with a petition asking
that the saloon license of William Lyons,
at 216 Post street, be revoked. The peti
tion was alleged to be signed by fourteen
establishments doing business on, Post
street, and recited that . the saloon was
a detriment to the growing retail trade
of that neighborhood. Lyons had been
cited to appear 'before the Commission
and was present with his attorney, Thom

tion was deferred until an adjourned

of the Board of Trade to do it. Person
ally, I favor the forfeiture clause In the
franchise." â¢ â¢

HEAL ESTATE TBANSACTIONS.
.: LOS ANGELES, April 29.â The Supremo
Court of the Independent Order of For
esters to-day convened In triennial ses
sion in Blanchard's Hall. After an exe
cutive session of the high officers of the
Supreme Court, the report of Dr.. Oron
hyetakha wa3 read. .
In his report. Dr. Oronhyetakha called
attention to the fact that up to January
1, 1902, the Supreme Court distributed : in
benefits to Its members' and their benefi
ciaries more than $11,250,000.
On January 1, 1898, the date to which
the figures presented at the last session
of the Supreme Court were brought down
by the financial officers of the Supreme
Court, the order had 124,683 members in
good standing. On January 1, 1902, the
ngurea were ldl.677 members, thU3 making
a net gain of 66,932 members during the
four years ending with December 31, 1901.
Accumulated funds that fetood at $2,558,-
S32 78 on January 1, 1SU8, had increased on
December 31.-19U1, to S5.142.U66 29.
The assets of the Â«rder in excess of lia
bilities amount to 15,127,453 73. The bal
ance to the credit of the mortuary fund
on December 31, 1901, was $5,051,710 33, and,
the balance of the sick and funeral fund
was $173,144 25. The general fund, bal
anced by a loaning contingent funJ,
amounted to $141,266 14, and of the sick
and funeral fund the amount of $110,994 51.
The number of women who had applied
for beneficiary membership -to December
1, 1901, was 16,245.
During three months â January, Febru
ary and March, 1902â the medical board
has reviewed 13,721 medical examination
papers, 10,976 being for male applicants
and 2745 for female applicants; 11,999 cases
were accepted and 1722 rejected.' .(
Dr. Oronhyatekha recommends that the
by-laws be so amended as to permit the
supreme chief ranger to make Foresters
at sight, as men Â¦- were knighted of old.
. He asks that a sick benefit department be
established by the Supreme Court. - - Â»-
The secretary's report shows that the
death rate of the order for the past year
was 6.66 per 100G members. The highest
rate of mortality was in Missouri and
Kansas, where the percentage was ; 14.51
per 1000, and the lowest in Colorado, Utah
and Arizona, which States show a rate
of 1.57 per 1000. The death rate for Cali
fornia was 7.03 per 1000;.
The reports of the supreme officers were
taken up and discussed in detail, but were
not completed at the time of adjourn
ment. Consideration will be resumed to
morrow. : ... 'â¢ â¢ .Â¦".'Â¦
There was a public reception this even-*
ing in Simpson's. Auditorium by Â¦ locÂ». ,
members of the order and citizens of Los

the Supreme Court. Governor Henry T.
Gage welcomed the delegates on behalf
of the State and Mayor M. P. Snyder on

great credit.
He was sent with the marines to China
under Major Waller. during the siege of
the legations and-was in the five days'

" not Â¦ interfere '. In ' the 'case* of the Impris

in official circles that King Victor Em

Lieutenant Doddridge. one of her watch
officers, and Assistant Surgeon Ledbetter

official regarding their plight has reached
.either the State or Navy, departments.
It was â¢. reiterated at the Navy Depart
ment-to-day that if the officers under ar
rest ' committed a' breach of the Italian
laws they must pay the penalty. â¢ Cap
tain Lemly, judge advocate general of the
navy, recalled to-day several cases where
officers were punished for Violating the
laws of a country at which the ship
toucned. : One case was that of a lieuten
ant named Elliott, who was . stationed on
the flagship of the South Atlantic squad
ron. So I many desertions from j the ship
had occurred that the admiral had given
instructions to his of fleers ' to shoot any
man attempting . to escape. While - in
charge of a boat's crew at a Brazilian
port, one of the. men started to run. El
liott killed him. He was at once arrested
by the Brazilian police,: was tried ".and
Â¦sentenced to a term ', of years, j Dom Pe
dro was at that time Emperor of Brazil,
and when the excitement subsided he par
doned the officer, . who . rejoined his ship.

Mabel L. Nicholas brought a suit- for

has for more than a year past been intem

1898, and have two children. .
Bowles, according to his wife's com
plaint, caused her a great deal of suffer
ing by frequently referring to â¢ the dis
parity in their ages, saying that It
"served an old man- like him right for
marrying a young girl." He Is 40 and she
is 19.
Mrs. Bowles alleges I still further that
her husband objected to her making .anil
serving him with a dish called "floating
island," saying that there was poison. in
it, and that when she sought to soothe and
calm him by kissing him he struck her in
the face. . '
She alleges further that he abused her
because sne suggested that he insure his
life. On another occasion, alleges Mrs.
Bowles, her husband got angry with her
sister because she asÂ«ed him if he was
angry and made her feel miserable, shout
ing in a loud voice: "My house is my
shining star. My wife's society is all I
care for. She doesn't care for me."
Mrs. Bowles alleges that her husband
has treated her cruelly ever since their
wedding day by accusing her of extrava

between her and his ttrst wife and by
cursing, and threatening to kill her.-' She
alleges that because sne refused to get

that she Â¦ made a mistake \ when sKe

for divorce, alleging cruelty. The mar
riage took place at Oakland, January SO,
1902.
The Council voted 5200 to Mrs. Jose
phine Henninger of 869 Washington street
for. damages done because of a smallpox
quarantine.
It is worth thousands of dollars to this city
to have the streets kept in repair; to have a
roadway brtdjre across Temescal Creek; to
have rails flush with the street and not es
they are on Seventh street, makins a "dead
line" through the city. I may be asking too
much, this may be unjust, but I want to
know where we stand.
Attorney L.. S. Church, representing the
railroad, replied that he believed the city
charter would control in the matter of
street repairs.
"I have no doubt," interjected Mr. Kel
ler, "that such a trifling matter like that
can easily be arranged."
Â¦Councilman Cuvellier thought President
Schaffer's remarks were to the point-
Lastly, Keller suggested that a confer
ence could be held about the matters re
ferred to and that a satisfactory arrange
ment could be made by which these
points could be settled. That suited the
Council, and the ntne-votes wwe -recorded
in favor of the ordinance.
The absentees were Councilman Bon,
who is sick, and Councilman Courtney,
who is in the East. ,
This franchise ordinance does not say the
streets shall be kept In repair; It does not
provide concerning the . kind of rails to be
used; ft does not declare what kind of power
ehall be used â they mlsht put on four-mute
trains. All of this kind of provision ought
to be In the franchise. We ought to know
what we have to expect. I shall vote to pass
this ordinance to print, but I state my views
In order that you may have time before the
final passage of the ordinance "to think over
the situation.
There is no question that the people of
thig city are enthusiastic over the prospect of
having the Santa Fe Railroad enter this city.
It will be a benefit to our city and is some
thing for which our people have been clamor
ing for years. But. if my opinion is correct,
1 believe in grantine a franchise that should
contain some restrictions. Other cities grant
x-estrictlve franchises. The Santa Fe Is anxious
to come here, not because they love you, but
because they are after business.
When Councilman Wixson after second
reading moved the passage of the or
dinance to print President Schaffer, who
had surrendered the chair to Councilman
Boyer, said: '-"-.-,
For fifteen years a little band of Oakland
liusiness men has been coaxing the Santa Fe
llallroad to come into Oakland. It is not
long afio^that the people of this -city sub
eenbed f2DO,000 as a bonus for that* road/
I^ow the Santa Fe is knocking at our doors
and is asking practically for no concessions,
practically no franchise â simply to use the
licht-of-way where Tracks are now laid. Cap
tain tfayson of the Santa Fe, who has author
ized nÂ» to speak ior him. does not make any
specific promises as to what the railroad will
do. but we Know this treat transcontinental
tTstem is not coming to Oakland for fun. We
know that it will connect with a ferry to
Ban Francisco and we believe that we can
afford to take chances in this matter. :

By unanimous vote of the members
present, the City Council to-night passed'
to print an ordinance granting the Oak
land and East Side Railroad (Santa Fe) a
1 rafttfiise through the city over the pres- '

'Although the nine members of the

QEORGE, McFADDEN, a self

aged to live by his wits and by
pinging in dives, was arrested
yesterday for the robbery and murder of,
Charles Tucker, an aged man 'whose body
was found in a doorway at '823 Howard
street at noon Monday. '. The . evidence
connecting McFadden with the old man|s
death is overwhelming, but. in despite 6S
this he persists in denying his .guilt.
Tuckers remains were Identified at .the
Morgue yesterday by Sheriff R. R. Veale
of Contra Costa County. The dead man
was a resident Â¦ of ' Martinez, where he
worked as a farm hand. He. was a mem
ber of the Salvation Army, but his habits
were not in consonance . with Â¦ the teach

addicted to drink and it was his custom
to go on sprees which lasted indefinitely.

at .723 Howard: street; informed. the police
that he saw McFadden and Tucker, stand
ing. in the very doorway > where â¢ an â¢ hour
later . Tucker's . body .was found. -> The men
were talking together. in some excitement;
Nelson paid little attention to the circum
stance until ; he ; saw the account . of the
finding of Tucker's body; in 'the: doorway
at 829. Howard street. Â¦
Thestory. of McFadden that he bruised
his I knuckles at Martin's , saloon I near the
Presidio is Â¦ false,', as there is no i such sa
loon. Â¦ ; He was Â¦ unable '.to produce Â¦ the Met-~
ter in '. which his . reported , remittance - of
$100 came, and the theory, of the police is
that his wounds were received in a strug
gle with Tucker at the? time of the rob
bery. , - Among his effects was i found a
shirt with badly torn-sleeves, a bit of
i evidence which the detectives regard as
of Â¦ great value. â¢" : ' Â¦ ;.- ..;Â» Â¦Â¦

night and pick ' up ten: times that' sum
without. difficulty. --. -..:?-'Â¦
f AlPof McFadden'ai stories to the police,
told since, his arrest.^ are contradictory. 1
He denies that he robbed Tucker,- and
,says thatihis failure to remember details
ofthe-past two days is.due.to An attack
of delirium. tremens.-, He. will t be held sub
ject to.the verdict; to be- rendered' by. the
Coroner's jury when the inquest is held.-,
, Â¦ A> boy 'by the name â¢ of ; George : Abblt.
who was, on his way down Howard street
about 1 10 . a, .- m. ':< Monday,'- says I he 2 saw ? an
old man come out of. a saloon at; 733 How
' ard - street; Â¦. and , a - youngi man - came Â» out
with him. "The 3 old'.man' had something
In', his hand,',' said â¢ AbbIt..V Â¥ which:may
have been : money, butTlf. it Lwas ; or not I
am : not sure. The young man ; was t try
ing-toiget the old one i to } go .'somewhere
up ; Howard < street.' i but ? he . would ; not T go,
and.the young one began- to struggle with;
shows the marks .of dissipation. .His
manner Is - that of a man who has made
the acquaintance of ; the police 'â¢. on'' more :
than one occasion, though he has not
been arrested; here before. He claims to
hail from- Harrisburg, Pa.,' and has lived,
here a year. Â¦ His Â¦ story as- to his 'mover
ments and doings is '-vague, but as far "as
the detectives have thus far learned- his
is the story ,of a wasted life, recklessness
of purpose and social degradation.' ' " .-.
McFadden says he met Tucker for, the
first time in V Mrs. Smith's, saloon ' at : 740
Howard, street about ll'o'.clock Monday.
They took a drink together. and separat
ed, that being the last, he saw of the dead
man. He was drinking . heavily, I and was
quite intoxicated. -When arrested McFad
den's knuckles were wounded in â¢ several
places and in trying. to account, forjthese
abrasions Â¦ h% tells the story. that he had
a fight In Martin's saloon near the Â¦ Pre
sidio. He says he had delirium trernens
Monday and went' to a friend's house -in
Oakland to recuperate. On his. return Uo
the Prescott House on.' Kearny; street,
where he lodged, yesterday ; morning he
was arrested.
The testimony secured by the detectives
is.. very strong against the accused. It
was discovered that although perennially
impecunious, McFadden had money on
the day of Tucker's' death. He bought a
Buit of clothes from f Leopold Hlrsch *' at
929 Kearny street, for which ! he paid ,' $10.
Hirsch says McFadden displayed " gold
coin ! amounting to about $50 at , the time
he made, the purchase. This was about

CHARGE CROOKS
WITH BURGLARY
The machine operated by the . bosses
may be strong enough to force the nomi
nation of Gage on the State. convention,
but the machine cannot bring the Repub
licans to the support of the ticket on elec
tion day. All the bosses are behind Gage
for renomination and the people are
against the bosses. The defeat of Wei is
for Mayor was a recent object lesson. He
was an honorable man, who had made a
pood record as Auditor, but he surren
dered himself to Burns, Herrin and Crira
mir.s, and so lost the confidence of inde
pendent voters. Eugene E. Schmitz car
ried the Republican districts, and the
nominee of the boss-ridden Republican
convention went down to defeat. It is said
that Wells contributed to his own defeat
by making silly speches, but Gage as a
letter writer is a lit companion for Wells
as a speech-maker. Since the San Jose
convention the bosses have been wonder
ing what will happen next if Gage's pen
is net bridled.

Slender Majority Given for
Gage in'- Los Angeles
.County. .
The popjilajity of Lieutenant Governor
ICeff is undisputed, it is claimed by. some
of the machine manipulafbrte that Neft
ran behind Gage in 3S&. ' Reference to the
o^riai figures show that 2S7.0S1 votes were
cast for Governor ana 2S0.325 for Lieuten
ant Governor. . This Indicates that 6726
voters simply 'voted for the head of tfte
ticket- Gage only received 2031 more
votes than were cast for NefC The figures
further show that NefTs majority over
his chief competitor, Hutchison, was
27,<04, while Gage's majority over Ma
guire was only 19,033. In San Francisco
Neff received 10S3 more votes than were
cast for Gage. Neff also ran ahead of
Gage in Alameda County- la Los An
geles, Gage's home county, where 28,652
votes were cast, the Governor got only
480 more votes than Neff received. In
Piacer Coimtv. the home of Neff, where
only 40M votes were cast, Gage ran 3S8
\otes behind the Lieutenant Governor. In
fact. Gage only beat Maguire in Los An
geles County by 2931 votes. Alameda,
San Francisco, Sacramento and . Santa
Clara counties enabled Gage to make a
good ehowing.
Four years ago, when Gage was nomi
nated for Governor, the party was united.
The war was on and patriotic enthusiasm
ran high- All the Republican newspapers
of the State supported the nominee cf
the convention. Careful observers of the
present political situation assert that
Gage could not carry Los Angeles County
against a fairly good Democratic can
didate. He is very unpopular in Sacra
mento, Solano, San Joaquin and Napa
counties. Alameda County' might stand
by him, but his majority of 1B98 would be
greatly diminished. San Francisco is
against Gage. Republicans will . not for
get his interferferenee in **"Â» local cam
paign, when he lined up the State Cen
tral Committee to recognize the County
