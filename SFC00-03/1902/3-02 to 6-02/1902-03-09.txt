"But I always knew there was some
good ore down there and when. In the
sp'rlng of 1900, I wasn't feeling very chip
per in health and "had a chance to s get
away from my place of Deestrict Attor
ney and County Superintendent of
Schools. I just packed up two or three
burros and lit out from our ranch in the
mountains, a dandy green spot that we
call the Little^ Empire. Down near Tono
pah. ninety miles from our ranch. It's a
blrdseye porphyry country, where the
volcanic action shows, and where the
ledges of bearing sulphide ores are crop
ping out and crossing each other. Here
I struck some rock one day that turned
out later to be the foundation of the town
of Tonopah. I walked right over the
Mizpah ledge, that cropped out plainly.
I took some samples to the assayer at
Candelaria, confident that I had found
what I had been so many years looking
lor. I offered him a good big share of
the product if be would make an assay.
He did not think much of It and I went
home and got busy.
"Three months passed Â«nd then I went
for my assay. The man had thrown the
samples out behind his shed and they
were laying there yet. I insisted and he
made the assay. And. sir, it went eight
een hundred dollars to the ton. That as
sayer made thousands of dollars out of
his Job. . I went back to the Little Em

and both my daughters were as glad as
1 was.
"We got somebody to do the haying, took

the location!. My wife, Bhe'd lived In a
mining camp a good deal of her life, and
I tell you she knows good rock, and she
knows as much as I do almost about

Well, when we got down there we camped

"We stayed there till October, doing the
locating and work. Funny how my old
woman named that ledge Mlspah. Shu
hud a woman friend that was always a

"You would like to have my wife's pic

carefully two little photo buttons. He
held them up proudly and I saw that
they portrayed a very flne looking
woman. "Bhe'B a tino looking woman for
her age, and a deserving one, too, I can
tell you. Lm never played for money or

her picture to go out for anybody."

we walked out in the corridor Â«p'"
"Now, did you ever see a prospector that
wai anything out of the usual to look at?
Maybe not. but they must knew quarts

have been a sÂ«cret at an elevation of
six hundred feet.' "Weil, after we located

good percent on what they took out. That

The France Mllltalre publishes statis
tics showing that cases of suicide are
very frequent In the French army; more
so, perhaps, than In any other European
force. Among every 1000 deaths in the
army from all causes*, no less than an
average of fifty (In 1830 exactly fifty and
in 1897 flfty-one) are caused by self-de
struction, while of every 100,000 men on
the rolls of the army 'no less than an
average of twenty-seven commit suicide
â¢very year. Among the colonial troops
the number is even higher. In the navy
the practice seems less prevalent.
I have always believed 'in the Europcnn
Sunday. Sunday In a dny of rest and,rec
reation. I think It should be different
from other^ days, but not set apart for
raedltatlon"and prayer. I do* not like the
Idea of having society gatherings on Sun
day, though It Is, a proper time for social
gatherings. It Is a pleasant custom to be
at home informally to one's friends, cither
Sunday afternoon or evening, but when
it comes to sending out Invitations for a
large reception, the same 'as any other
day In the week, I don't like it. The
Mrs. Horace Davis.
What day other than Sunday has a
man to call in? Business cares keep
him busy all the rest of the time, and
Sunday seems the most convenient. an>l,
in fact, the most desirable day of all.*
This Idea of having one's friends in to
drink tea and to have a. delightful chat
was a clever notion. One is able to see
cer bo many more people in a single day
than they wouid In a month ordinarily.
A man could not possibly call on as many
of his frir-ndti jiK arÂ« uathpr*Â»d together,
and this way make-H It possible for him,
to have a" Jolly time ul] around. What
could xotm Ktrange about it? Is not a
call a ca'.l though called by any other
name? ,
day?" The idea Is Identical, so far as I can
see It. Sunday was chosen because the
men could drop In. Many of them owed
calls; many of them would have called
anyhow. On that particular Sunday there
were probably over a hundred young peo
ple who happened in during the day to
drink tea and have a little chat. Yes, she
had some friends help her entertain
her guests, if you call them such. ' I have
no idea whether teas, receptions or any
thing of that kind are to be popular. â¢ I
have never given it any thought. We
merely had our friends rorne when we
could get them. Does not every one have
some one visit them informally on Sun
day? , ., r :'
I did not have a tea. My daughter had
an "at home," 'or, in other words, a few
friends came in quite informallyâ a mere
call. What difference is there In* a call
made on Sunday from one made on Mon-
Mrs. William F. Herrin.
Teas? Why, what should a man know
about teas?. Oh, the Sunday ones, you
mean. I never noticed that they were,
any different from any others. Perhaps
they are. As a rule, the houses are not as
crowded as they are on other days, and
one can get about better. That makes
them Jolly, you know. I don't know
whether they are going to be popular or
not. However, put me down with the ma

I do not mean to make religion a bug
bear, nor do I mean. to censure anybody,
for each and every person has a distinct
right to his or her own opinion. But let
me say right here that It la this very
looseness of affairs that makes men have
as little regard for women as they have.
If more women were strict church-goers
and attended to certain things only on
Sunday there would be less of that disre
spect which is constantly growing.. That
Is Mainly shown by the awful calamities
thac have happened lately. It is Just such
moral looseness ttfat makes San Francisco
rotten to the core.
The Pharisees burdened religion. They
felt that almost everything was work.
They even carried the subject to such a
length that a serious debate arose as to
whether a man should wear a wooden leg
on Sunday. They questioned Christ when
he healed on the Sabbath. They said it
was work. And for that reason he said,
"Come unto me. ye that are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest." , He did
not mean to burden people with religion.
He meant to make life simpler. When
people give teas or entertain on that day
they certainly do not follow out that
Idea.
The Sabbath was made for 1 man and
not man for the Sabbath; as most people
seem to believe. I do not think It is right
for a man to bring In all his friends and
overwhelm his wife or his servants. In
doing this we take our minds from the
true significance of the day. and not only
our minds, but those of the people whom
we entertain. The Sabbath should be
known for Its extreme simplicity. Life la
too fast. Truly right living is a fine art.
I would not give a tea on Sunday, but- 1
go to them. That sounds something like
a difference with a very fin* distinction.
But there are six other days for enter
tainments, and it does not seem positively
necessary to utilize the seventh. Still, tae
men certainly are an advantage, and in
these days they aeem absolutely neces
sary to society.
Bev. Frank EL Baker.

You ask a busy man whether he ap
proves of Sunday afternoon teas or not.
I know very little about them, as I have
worked every Sunday for a month. Well,
yes, for several months in fact It cer
tainly is more pleasure to call than it Is
to work. For anybody who has the time,
who has the inclination and who enjoys
them I think It Is all right.

In your own home If you were expecting
company. Nothing more. I do not ap
prove of a big affair on an extensive plan
for Sunday. We have kept Ip the South
ern fashion of keeping open house on
Sunday afternoon and evening. Any of
our friends are more than welcome to
drop in and have chocolate, so that the
idea does not seem so foreign to me.

and Hie fiollofi hap takrn a strong
hold with our smartest , set,
Washington was thp rlngleadcf
In this fancy, but this city wac a
quirk ppcond and an apt pupil. Th # e ques
tion of tbe'moment is whether it is right
or wrong to place Sunday on a par with
the week flays. What do you think about
It? Here follows what a number of
prominent San Franciscans have to say
on the matter. With whom do you agre^e?'
I do not approve of turning the Sabbath
into a day of pleasure and recreation, but
the European Sunday Is most certainly
with us In San Francisco. The people who
work do not use It as a day of play any
more than the people o.f leisure do. It la
something that might be called peculiarly
San Franciscan. ifiSf$i
Just as long as the f resent state of bust'
ness affairs lasts people will use Sunday
for recreation. And until tha shops close
at noon on Saturday and> earlier lo tb*
evenings Sunday la the only day that the
working people have that Is their own.
When a man works until 6 o'clock he Is
tired and wants his dinner. After that
he must dress and by the time he Is ready
to visit so much of the evening has passed
that he can, at ' the best, make but one
call.

' Sunday afternoon calling Is certainly
very popular with the gentlemen. Judg
ing from the way they are flocking In in
creased numbers to the homes of the
girls on Sunday Just In time for tea bears
out the idea that their popularity Is not
on tha wane. But Sunday afternoon calls
ere not a fad, The Idea Is not new. What
really la new Is tha fact that .people are
commencing to expect more visitors than
they usedHo, Tne majority of homes keep
"open house" throughout the' afternoon
and evening, particularly the (Southern

Joseph Bosborough.
I do not approve of the Sunday after
noon teas? or receptions. But right here
let me say that neither do I heartily dis
approve of them. The main reason why
I do not sanction them is on account of
ray little children. Sunday must be differ
ent to them from other day3. While they
ride their horses and have their books ,
there are numerous things that they are
not allowed to do. and to them Sunday la
Sunday. Thi3 having of teas, receptions
or "at homes," if you so please to caj 1
them, would work havoc with their Ideas.
When one has reached the age of dlscro- I
tion the Ideas of right and wrong may be *
settled by one's self, but until then the
guiding hand must be In evidence. And
so, you see I am not enthusiastic over
tny kind of Sunday entertainment.

Sunday afternoon tens. Are they to be
popular and do I approve of them? Why
of course. Why not? Is not Sunday a
good day to call Informally? But you
mean a really, truly tea, where hosts of
people are expected, don't you? I have
never had one on Sunday. Just a few
friends In to drink tea and chat. But I
think they are perfectly lovely Just the
aame.'aa the men can attend. Of course
that is the only reason why Sunday la
chosen; as tho other days are crowded
with business. From the number that

fancy they will increase instead of de
crease In popularity.

SUNDAY
AFTERNOON
TEASM. Paderewski was becoming eloquent
In defense of his work. '.'If I were to
make an analysis I could show a likeness
in the method among the greatest of com
posers. For instance, look at Schumann's
"Yet the first theme is not the same.
The second theme is not the same, the
orchestration Is not the same.. I defy Â£iny
one to throw that anything except this
one little run is borrowed. Yet for this
detail of method the prelude is con
demned."
"Music, you see,, is "different from
poetry. It appeals to the ear. A sound
or* a combination of sounds in a work
that only have' to do with the method,
may remind one of some other music, and
the whole is set down as | not original.
luex. us look at the prelude to the third
act in 'Manru.' That has been criticized.
There is one run, a little run, that re
minds one of 't>ie Walkure.' I knew it. I
tried to avoid it, but could not. Others
heard it and they talk of the suggestion
from 'Â£>ie Walkure.*
M. Paderewskl was evidently deeply in
earnest. "A' piece of music must be built
like a house or a church," he went on.
"You would not accuse an architect of
being a copyist if he put windows in a
hcuEe, would you? And yet he Is merely
doing what others have done.' Likewise,
when you read the works of the great
pcets, you would not accuse Browning or
Longfellow of plagiarism if they used the
same style of verse as some one else?
Their thoughts you would consider and
not so much their method.
"But there is no such thing as stealing
a theme in music," h^ continued. He was
now aggressively defensive. "In music
absolute originality does not exist. It Is
the temperament of the composer* that
ir,f kes his work. In method one cannot
help but follow those who have gone be
fore. When a great genius like Wagner
introduces a method that will give better
expression to an idea it is not only not a
nin to -follow it, but it is a duty to follow
it. In employing such a method it con
cerns not to much the idea as its treat
ment in a musical way."
ame," he said. It was evident that one
of the composer's guardians thought the
interview was becoming too prolonged..
"I am coming." 6aid M. Paderewski. He
arose.
"You wished to say something, I sug
'gested. Â¦ ' - â¢ .
He turned back. "Yes." He waited to
make certain of his words. "Some one
has thought that 'Manru' was not all my
own," he said. Some of the learned ones
in America who had found suggestions,
reminiscences and likenesses of former
masters in his work had wounded him.
"They have said there were suggestions
from Wagner."
"And not from him aloneâ from others,"
said Mr. Adllngton. â¢ ' -
Â¦ "His best work Is done at his summer
home, the Chalet Riondbosson, - on Lake
Geneva; There he generally goes for four
or five months in the year. He will arise
at 9 or 10 o'clock,, work at composing or
at the piano until about 1 o'clock, then
take his first meal of the day. He will
again work until 6 o'clock, "and then take
a walk in the garden or a swim, for he is
a fine swimmer. Then- there will be a
dinner at 8 o'clock, and afterward light
amusement. " But whether he is at home
or on tour it ia always work." Â¦Â¦'Â£&$$?&%
"He will sit there until 8 o'clock." said
Mr. Adlington. "Then he will -dine. Then,
maybe, he will have an hour of billiards.
Then he will practice again. What time
he will go to bed I do not know. It ia
work, work, work, all the time. He
wasn't feeling very well last night; was
nervous, didn r t fenl like sleeping, and kept
me up till 6. o'clock this morning, and
even when I went to bed he was still
stirring. He is always at the piano or
composing.
."Sometimes the mood" for composing
Will not come for months at a time, but
.when it comes he writes music as quickly
as you would write a letter. . Then he will
go over what he has composed and try it
on the piano. Then he will lay. it away,
and after a while take it up and go over
H again. He polishes and retouches every
thing he composes three or fous times,
and never lets anything go until Tit suits
him. . -
"And 'Carmen.' Can we not find here
an enormous influence exerted' by Gou
nod? And it not only reminds you of
Gounod, but some of the themes, as sung,
are taken wholly from Spanish music. .
The 'Habanero* is not even Bizet's, but in
all the scores that are published is shown'
to be taken from a composer who waa.
alive when the opera was written."
M. Paderewski let the subject rest there.
"How do you find time to. compose and
how do you work?" I asked. :
"It Is not really" , ,'
What he would have said was stopped
'by a knock. Again it was "madame"â
this time imperative. Â¦ M. Paderewski
looked at. his watch. He 'had been talking
about his opera almost three-quarters of
an hour. He again took my hand in his
crushing grip and went out. A few 'mo
ments later the piano in his room was
trilling and executing a delicate run. ; .
"Beethoven .was not free from the influ
ence of ' other masters, for in his works
we often find the suggestion of Mozart.
And witness also- the first concerto of
Chopin. Is it not suggestive very strongly
of Hummel? .
concerto in A minor. The first theme i*
taken almost wholly in method from Men
delssohn. And Wagner in his first period,
and even well into the second period, is
not entirely original. One may easily find
the influence of Weber and then of Meyer
beer. , . . â¢ .
"Oh, yes. It was finished and ready
about two years ago. I tried it. I thought
it would do. Then my friends produced
it at Dreesden.' and you know what has
happened since." ;
"And you wrote lit over about three
tirr.es?" said Mr. Adlington.
"Yes; about three times. 1 '
"And you spent . eight years upon it?"
I asked, i
"Not all of â¢eight years," he said. "It
was about fifteen months in all. You can
not do two things at once, you know. If
so, one must suffer. So I do not compose
when I am on my tours. I must then
practice all the time."
M. Paderewski lighted another cigar
ette and carelessly threw aside the holder
of the spent one, which many a fair ad
mirer would have considered almost price-:
less.
"But there is. one thing I would like to
say," he resumed. He was again inter
rupted by a knock.
Mr. Adlington went, to the door. "Mad-

the first production of "Man

"The mvl of a gyosy must, respond to

life of a jrypsy. He sine* as a Â«~hild He
plays always' rn<] anything.. He knows
not a note of music as you would know It
nnd yet he plays the grandest music. See
ths man on the stage In 'Manru' who
plays the cymbals. He could not read a
note of music, and yet In a few days he
had learned to play as he should in the
epera." Â¦
"But your work upon the opera?" I said.
M. Padf-rfwpki was l*-anini? forward in
hÂ«.<= chair. Tbore was just the Suggestion
of a dreamy Ugbt in h5s eyes, the wrinkles
had pone out of liis brow, and there was
a tow* cf color in his usually colorless
face. Ht> n-a-: taikin? of (something that

#'Yes, but there was much more to be

and wrote ihat again. It was then that 1
first introduced th* violin on the stage and
made prominent Jn the work the music
which drcyÂ«' iianru back to his gypsy
people. Â¦
"Then I found that I must change more,
because the third act did not suit," and
M. Paderewski paused again. "Perhaps
it was good, but it was not dramatic.
The f-oncert on the stage was not then
in this act â the climax where the orches
tra and the chorus carry the air which
was played on the violin in the second
act. And this was the striking thing."
There was a knock at the door and M.
Paderewski flopped.
"Madame." paid the valet suggestively.
"In a moment." said the comooser in
French. His train of thought had been
irlcrriintod.
"There was one striking thing," I ven
tured.
*'6o we had to make it three acts. Of
course, that required much writing. Then
we tried it end we found that the first
act would not do. It was not dramatic.
Bo we had to change that. The mother
was not in that act at first and we in
troduced the mother. That strengthened
it much, but. of course, it was necessary
to change all the music."
"That must have simplified matters," 1
IntPrrupted.
The composer paused a moment. "But
it would not do," he said, slowly. I asked
why. "It was pronounced good music,"
he replied, "but it would not do for the
stage. It was not dramatic. It was then
in two acts, and two acts suggest the in
termezzo so much." He. paused again.
"And I do not think that the intermezzo
has any place in opera.
"But that was not made so strong at
first," he continued. "It was not de
veloped in the opera as it was first writ
ten. Mr. Nossig worked upon 'Manru'
and I worked upon it in the times when
I was not upon tour, and it was about six
years ago that we had it finished. Then
we took it to Dresden and had it tried."
"Was it his suggestion that the chief
theme should be the racial instinct instead
of the love for a woman?" I asked.
"No; that was mine." A psychologist
would have been interested In the empha
sis which the composer placed on this. It
was significant, that a descendant of Poles
should have been so earnest to let it be
known that he had discovered and evolved
this stirring theme.
WOUL.D one be a mazier of the
highest art that humankind can
boast? Would one aspire to
take his place on the heights of
fame where rest Verdi. Rossini
and Wagner? Then one must work, in
season and out of season, work! Wealth
may come beyond one's dreams; men may
flatter and court, but etUl work!
That Is a lesson I learned from the
latest aspirant for a place among the ope
ratic Immortals. I asked M. Ignace Jan
PaderewBkl one day recently how he
Â¦wrote his opera, "Manru." which abroad
Â«tnd In America has achieved a flattering
success. And he told me.
Years he had dreamed of it. -while he
â¢was acclaimed as a master of Interpreta
tion. 6ix years he worked upon It, fifteen
months' actual time he epent upon it,
writing and rewriting, trying over and
over, putting la new effects, until at last
be was ready to present It to the world.
"Manru" probably will not be his last
opera. lor there is more work In the
fcturdy, patient, aggressive man who is
Just now in the prime of life.
I had last seen M. Paderewski in an
hour of Bupreme triumph. A brilliant
Metropolitan Opera-house audience, repre
tenting the wealth and fashion of New
York. and. therefore, the aristocracy of
America, had heard his "Manru" and ac
claimed him a worthy member or the se
lect coterie of composers of grand opera.
Some had all but worn out their hands
with applause, and others had fairly Bplit
their voices with "Bravos." and again
and again he had gone before the curtain
to bow his acknowledgments.
An able lieutenant- is Mr. W. Adlington,
who has been "sole agent" for M. Pade
rewski since he concluded he could best
forward his own plans by being his own
manager. Any request for a part of the
composer's time must pass the scrutiny
of Mr. Adllngton and receive the approval
of lime. Paderewskl.
It was Mr. Adllngton who came to the
lobby of the Manhattan Hotel when I Bent
a card to M. Paderewskl, after having
written a letter asking for an interview.
It was necessary to promise that two
minutes would be sufficient, and because
the promise was given Mr. Adlington led
the wav to his apartments.
Then M. Paderewskl came in. He wore
his accustomed black frock coat and he
was smoking his usual Russian cigarette.
M. Paderewski has reached the prime of
his manhoodâ he is about 42 â and his
frame is set ruggedly, while his face has
taken on decisive lines. Two deep
wrinkles between the eyes are marks lelt
bv his musical creations. He is a man of
the world, who makes those whom he
meets feel at home with him. He gripped
my hand with a grasp that any athlete
might envy, for the hands that wield such
mastery over the piano are like steel. He
offered* me a cigarette, and waited to be
questioned.
"Americans like a man who has made
himself," I said. "When a person a:eom
pliches a great deal they want to know
how it is done. They have heard your
"jlasra* and they want to know some
tning about its creation."
M. Paderewski was Interested. With
him "Manru" is a living thing, a favorite
child of his artistic soul, a creation in
which for the present his life is centered.
"It was very long ago when I began."
he said. "And, of course, I have not re
membered all ab<jut it."
"How long?" 1 asked.
"Fully eight years," he answered. Eight
years ago M. Paderewski had tasted th<<
nreets of triumph :Â±s tin interpreter of the
mus:c of others. As a pianist he had been
the rase of Paris, had crossed the chan
nel anu conquered England, and had fur
ther extended his conquest to America.
"Before that I had thought of writing an
opera," he continued. VI t was then, how
ever, that I began. I was not proficient
in verse, though 1 believed I could write
the music, so 1 asked my friend
NoEEig to write the words for me. He
knew the novel of 'Manru,' and he sug
posted that the subject be taken from
that."

THE OPERATION HIT
OF
NEW
YORKwith a strong bas relief In marble of a
painting by Rubens, "The Entombment."
Above the altar is a large mosaic repre
senting "The Last Supper," the original
of which, done by Cosimo Rosselli In the
fifteenth century, is in the Sistine Chapel
at Rome. The copy in the Stanford .Me
morial " Church is the first and only one
ever permitted to be made. Above or be
tween the windows of the apse, which
represent the crucifixion, the burial and
resurrection of Christ, is a Gloria Del An
geli.
Extending around the entire apse, just
above the altar and on a line with the
windows, are a line of heroic figures in
mosaic, representing John, Jeremiah,
Ezekiel, Samuel, David, Elias, Moses and
Isaias. The rich colors of their robes are
the more effectively brought out by a
background of gold.
Twelve niches with designs in gold and
mosaic above them contain lifesize figures
of the twelve apostles in pure 'whitÂ© Car
rara marble, six on either side of the al
tar. They are majestic and beautiful crea
tions and were brought from Italy, where
they Â¦were carved by the sculptors. Sereg
ni and Bierneri. Each statue weighs a
ton or two, and the windows and statues
in the church alone represent an outlay
of hundreds of * thousands of dollars.
There could be nothing more beautiful
than the altar of the Memorial Church
and its surroundings.
Facing the apse at the northern extrem
ity of the nave is the choir loft, where
stands the grand organ, with seats for
â¢150 singers between its two sides. The
keys of the console, or key 'board, below
and facing the singers, have electrical con
nection with the 3000 pipes of the organ.
This grand instrument has forty-six
stops, contains thirty miles of wire, and
â¢has the handsomest front ever placed on
an organ. Like the rest of the sacred
edifice, ' veneers nor shams have no part
in Its construction.
Could no loftier thÂ»me be found, its
first notes might well be sounded in
praise of the stately and beautiful crea
tion In stone that surround.3 it
study in perfect detail, are large mosaics
.in rich colors and gold, which latter effect
s enters largely into the color scheme of. the
interior. The transept galleries, of carved
"stone and steel, have railings carved in a
â¢Chaste design that are said to represent
the finest work of its kind In the United
States. The finely executed stone work in
the church has been under the direction
of John D. McGilvray, but the magnifi
cent mosaics came direct from Italy. It
is doubtful if more, elaborate decorations
In mosaic can be found in America. This
part of the decorations alone represents
. on outlay of over SSO.OCO..
Over all this sculptured beauty is
thrown- the dim religious light of forty
seven stained glass windows, designed by
Charle3 : and Frederick Lamb of New
York. -These windows were on exhibition
at the -Pah-American Exhibition. The
colors in them are so arranged as to give
the : most beautiful effects from the inte
rior of the church. 'They are pronounced
by critics to be the finest work of the
kind that America has produced.
Twenty of these windows, many of them
In. the transept, galleries, are single figure
.panels representing prominent characters
of the Old Testament. Twenty-seven of
them, are taken from the Tissot series of
paintings, representing scenes In the life
of Christ from his childhood up. Their
fine coloring Is nothing short of wonderful
in beauty. .
To ' the left of the apse Is the lectern,
or pjilpit, of stone, heavily carved
in appropriate designsâ the cross, lilies,
-etc. .This is a fine example of
rich church â¢ accessories. ; Broad white
marble steps lead - up toward the
altar of purest whitÂ© : Carrara marble,
which is surrounded by the richest deco
ration of . the whole edifice. Upon the

what is the finest tower clock on the

the whole is reached by a winding stair

McNeely Foundry, In Troy, N. Y. The
chimes are a duplicate of those on ih;
Parliament building In London.
Heavily carved doors lead into the wide
vestibule of the church, with marble floor
and groined oaken ceiling. From this
spoto the magnificently proportioned inte
rior springs uppn ; the sight, and with its
Moorish arches and the lace like tracery
of its carvings Impresses one as truly a
poem in stone. In the center of the nave
four huge flfty-|wo-foot carved arches
supporting the tower, with a clear span
of forty feet, mark off the softly lighted
space beneath the dome.* From the crown
of these arches springs a cove ceiling, done
in the most richly colored mosaics, with
lifesize figures of angels in different atti
tudes. Above, the ceiling narrows to a
thirty-two-foot open circle above the fres
coed celling of the true dome. The height
from the floor to the apex of the dome Is
106 feet.
The vaulted ceiling of the nave is beau
tifully carved in wood, upheld by copper
finished binding rods and light and grace
ful hammerbeam trusses. The ceiling is
seventy feet above the floor, which is of
the richest Moorish tiling, with a sllgh'.
Incline toward the apse.
The carving on the arches and columns
is exquisite, and it s> foliated beauty gives

only to those to whom its memorial
arches and windows are inscribed, but to
the taste and lavish generosity of Mrs.
Jane L. Stanford, who planned herself
the entire Interior, decorations. The
church has been in course of erection for
nearly three years and has cost nearly
half a million dollars.
Dr. Heber C. Newton will deliver the
dedicatory sermon and Professor Brooke
will direct the music to.be given, which
a large choir has been rehearsing. The
building is imposing from any point from
â¢which one may come upon it; particularly
so from the archway entering the famous
quadrangle, where the eye meets the
north facade, broken by the memorial
rose window^ and overshadowed by the
belfry tower, surmounted by its golden
cross. From the ground to the tip of this

THE MEMORIAL CHURCH
OF STANDFORDJames Blair, General James Reddlngton,

days of gold. â¢ , Â¦
"In 1850 and 1851 the bay and rivers were
full of boats," continued the captain. 'In
1S51 I built the C. M. Webber, another
'steamer sent out lnsectlons. ,A. B. Row
ley was engineer and Captain Lamb waa
in charge. I then, went to Philadelphia,
leaving here in- May, 1851, returning in
November. Within the next few months
I built for myself and Captain William
Kohl a sloop for the Sacramento trade.
We named her the Bianca. Captain John
Hutton was commander. She was 70 feet
long, 18 feet beam and 6 feet hold. 'â¢ I next
built a side-wheel steamer - called the
Uncle Sam for ' Captain Turnbull and
shipped her to the Colorado Hiver. She.
was the pioneer boat in that river. â¢ He
was a Government contractor,: I believe.
Early in 1853 I built the Pike for Captain
E. J. â¢ Weeks. She was built and launched
in twenty-eight days. She waa then taken
to the site of W. T. Garratt's brass foun
dry, where her-machinery was put in' by
Gordon & Stein,- who then had a machine
shop there.- . i
"l.then laid the keel for" a side-wheel
steamer for: Charles Minturn, Â¦ which was
the i first .ferry-boat built . In San i Fran
cisco. Â¦-. She was 120 feet long,' 24 feet beam
.and 7'feet hold. George Coffee put in the
machinery. The engine was low pressure.
I launched her in .sixty, days from the day
the keel was laid. She was strongly.and
well built, and though; I paid $9 a day for
laborers I could .not to*day duplicate that
boat - for the same cost.' * She | was named
the . Clinton and -ran; as ' a ferry to Oak

was as good work as I ever . turned' out;

also put up a - dredge for Mr."Mlnturn,
the machine being In use at Stockton un
til ' a few years ago and perhaps yet. , '. My
.shipyard at that time was at the foot of
Third street.. In 1854 I built the Kate L.
Heron for myself s.nd others. We put
her in the -Stockton trade; also the Flora
. machinery was put In by -George K. Glu
yas. She was named the Georgiana after
,the Georgiana Slough, which connects the

she was the' first steamer that went
through that slough from one river to
the other. - . â¢ : Â¦. ' â¢
."The rirst. trip was made in April, 1850.

freighting on those rivers, and later on 1
built two other sloops with water tanks
,in them, to supply the shipping with fresh
water, which was mainly obtained from
Sausali to, there being many fresh springs
in that vicinity. These sloops, our orig
inal water . company, Â¦were named Clara

$30 .for a: ton of freight and- $30 for a pas
senger, and the. "boat's had as much as
they could do In both freight and-pas
senger traffic, but the. down trip 'was
usually lightâ only/ passengers, who-- were
coming from the mines on "business, and
pleasure â sometimes â¢- more Â¦ for pleasure,
for they spent money freely, in 'those good
old â¢ days. Finally r the - rate war" reduced
the passenger charge to as low as $l,;nnd
the same for a ton of frelghtl- But the
'war 1 did not last; long.' .The 'California
Steam Navigation Company -was i. formed
in 1851, and' bought -all of ' the" opposition
steamers and consolidated them into one
,llne. Captain W. H.- Moore and " Captain
J. G. . North , owned a few steamers and
these were the beginning of that company.
The members of this great company were

8 feet hold. The machinery waa built br
the RIsdon Iron Works of this city. 1
also built about the same time two
freight barges for the same company. I
also built* at Stockton the Mary Garratt
for the California Steam Navigation Com
pany. And now," said Captain Mar
cucci, "from this time, 1869 to 1877, I quit
boat building and was engaged in other
business. In 1878 I left the city again for
the East and went to -Venezuela to sea
my mother. I. returned here In the early
part of 1S79, and at the request of W. T.
Garratt took the position of superintend
ent of the California Steam Navigation
Company's line and subsequently became
one of the directors and vice president of
the company. I held this position for
about two years, when, owing to a com-,
bi nation against Mr. GarratVs lnterestSTV
which I represented, I was squeezed out. '
But very soon another combination was
made, Mr. Garratt again got control ana
I was reinstated.
"Well," continued the captain; "in 1S8>
the California Steam Navigation' Com
pany and the San Joaquln Improvement
Â¦Company consolidated, and formed the
California Navigation and Improvement
Company. In this new company I waj
given a subordinate ' position. The naxt
year this company bought out our Inter
est and I was again out of business," said
the captain, smiling at the many changes
of the current. "In 1S90 I made the plans
for the Dauntless and the Captain Weber
for the Union Transportation Company of
Stockton. This was my last boat work.
"In December, 1S20, I was appointed by
the Secretary of the Treasury to the posi
tion of assistant inspector of hulls of
sieam vessels for the port of San Fran
cisco. I resigned this position on the 1st
ot January, 19oo, two years ago, because
of my advanced age. I will be 75 years
old on the 23th day of April next. I have
retired from all business, and, though I
take good care of myself, I feel that my
body is growing weaker as age advances.
While my life has not been one of great
adventures, I ' have had many reverses,
but I never gave up. : 1 always depended
upon myself, believing that by hard-work
one must succeed. I have seen San Fran
cisco grow, from a small town to Us pres
ent size, and the boat building industry
Increase from the primitive shipyards,
with their crude materials, to its present
dimensions. It is â¢ a long, .long time in
one's Hfe," concluded CapAin Marcucci.,.
changing his musings of tna past to th*
future,. as he again referred to his retire
ment from an active .and busy life.

FIRST BOATBUILDER ON THE PACIFIC COAST
Temple for - myself and Charles Me- (
Laughlin for. the Sacramento trade. She t
was 130 feet long, 28 feet beam and 7 feet 1
deep. She was a- side-wheeler with one
engine. . , , ; . i
"In the same . year;*' continued Captain i
Marcucci, referring to his memoranda, 1
"I changed the old brig Columbia into a i
steam propeller, and towing boat for a l
man named .'Holmes, who called her the U
Abble Holmes. She was used f 6r water- . :
ing ships and stored water in tanks lo- i
â¢cated . at tne 'Â¦ fast of Washington street. '
George >IC Gluyas' put in the machinery. <
About this . time boat' building became '
dull, the rivers and bays being well sup- I
plied, and I. went into the coal business, '
my office being on the south side of Mar- j
ket street, opposite.: Sansome.. I did not >
succeed and sold out. In May, 1856, I de- '
cided . to . try . my luck mining and
started out tfor Shasta County, stopping '.
at what was-called Horsetown. I worked Â¦
ar hydraulic mining for' about two years :
with no success, and returned to San '
Francisco financially stranded and with
one of my hands crippled from a prema
ture blast. I then concluded that I knew
nothing about mining and would there- '
after work at a business- 1 knew some
thing about," said the captain, smiling at !
the recollection of his sad experience. .
"In 1S58," said the captain, - "I went to* *
work at the Government yard at Mare -
Island, on the old sloop-of-war St. Mary. '.
Though I had met , reverses I knew the '.
only way was. to go to fiard work again,
which I have : always done, . and ; I â¢ have :
seen some discouraging times in my Â¦ long :
.career in this- city. In the ' summed of ,'Â¦
1838' I quit working at Mare. Island, and
began again at San Francisco. Here I
laid thekeel for a sldewheel steamer 120
feet long, twenty-four feet deep and seven
feet hold for Coffee & RIsdon. ' She had \'
two high pressure engines, fourteen inches -.
.bore, and two cylindrical tubular boilers.
The engines ; were; built in -this i city by '.'Â¦
â¢ Devoe &' Dinsmore. She was named the
Princess, and . put Â¦' In the -Sacramento
trade in opposition - to j the California
Steam 'Navigation Company. Â¦ .
VI, next -built the Rambler, a sldewheel *\
steamer of nearly the same dimensions,
for Mr. Lunnerton. She .was put in : the
Petaluma . trade. ... She . carried.- one single
. high pressure engine, of the same size as 1
that of. the Princess, and which was aiso
built by Devoe & Dinsmore. In the early
days of mining the principal freight was,
of course, supplies for the mines, but by
this time the kinds of freight had largely
increased.
"In 1860, with my yard again at the
foot of Third street, I built the lumber
schooner Fannie, and, later, the barken
tine Monitor for the lumber trade, also
the sternwheel steamer for Captain Mills
for the upper Sacramento trade, and sev
eral-barges for that trade, which was
now being opened up with considerable
activity. Another " vessel was a side
wheeler for Pope & Talbot named the
Cyrus Walker. -Captain Bullene put in
the machinery and took her up to Puget
Sound to tow logs to the lumber mills,
which were then being established at
points on the coast convenient to boat
building. I built in 1865 the Reliance for
the /Alviso Transportation Company,
which was composed of James lick, A. B.
Rowley and others. She was a propeller,
120 feet long, twenty-six feet beam and
nine feet deep, with one high-pressure
engine. * The engine and the two boilers
were built In this city at the Paclflc Iron
Works. I next built the Pioneer, a stern
wheeler, for tne Sacramento trade. The
engines were built by the Globe Iron
Works at Stockton, and the boilers by the
Coffee & RIsdon Works df this city. The
Pioneer was built at the foot of Second
street, on the Tichenor ways property,
for I had then moved my shipyard to this
point. In those days we moved our ship
yards to the most convenient point on
the waterfront, or at any point. wher,e a
man wanted -a boat built. We had no
modern machinery for launching a boat,
and the launching was done by workmen
pulling at the /ropes. In 1868 I built the
Santa Claus for Goodall & Perkinsâ she
was a propeller with twin screws, 130 feet
long, thirty feet beam and ten feet hola.
The engines were built by John Lockhead
of this city. ' Â¦
"In the same year I built the Brisk for
Banker W. C. Ralston. Lockhead also made
the machinery, including a Lockhead pat
ent boiler, which was not a success. As
there was not room enough to put In an
old-style boiler, I hauled her out, cut her
In two In the middle, and put In twenty
five feet to lengthen her.. I then- put in
two tubular boilers, butâ she was never
very brisk and belied her name," said the
captain,' smiring. "In 1869 I built the Val
lejo for the California Pacific Railroad
Company to run. to Vallejo. She was a
propeller, 130 feet long, 28 feet beam and
passengers â miners from .the diggings
coming; to town on business and pleasure.
The charge was $30 for a ton of freight
and the same for passengers. Miners from
the 'diggings' paid their fare in gold dust,
the purser keeping scales for weighing it
I; paid workmen in my shipyard jy a day,
but. the price soon afterward advanced to
$16 a day, but the work was good. We got
our timber where we could nnd itf-some-.
times it floated down the bay and lodged
at the 'Long "Wharf,* and later we Went
across into the country and cut it with
whlpsaws, as there were no sawmills here
in the. first days of shipbuilding. : â¢
"Tba next work," continued the cap
tain, Vwas the steamer El Dorado. She
was. sent from Philadelphia by the Pa
cific-Mall Company.. She sailed here,
rigged as " a three-masted schooner, com- .
ing through the Straits of Magellan, and
arrived in November, 1849, 1 put guards
and a cabin on her which had been made
in Philadelphia, and, the machinery being
placed, she was completed on the 1st ot
January, 1850, and placed oh the San
Francisco and Stockton route. She.had
only one engine. Edward Thomas was
the first engineer and A. B. Rowley, who
afterward built the Alviso flour mill, was
the'second engineer. I do not- reaiember
the dimensions of this boat. My next
boat was the keel of a small side-wheel
steamer, sent out by the same company,
and named the Georgians, She was 73
feet long, 16 feet beam and 4*4 feet hold.
The keel was laid on February 22, 1850. 1
launched her with steam .up and she
started on her trial â¢ trip at once. . The

and ehe was the first to run on' the bay
from San Francisco to Stockton. Joseph
Alderman put in the machinery, Price and
Kendall built her cabin, Hugh May; was
the engineer and Isaac Warren was cap
tain. This boat was named the' Captain
Butter, in honor of the man who first dis
covered gold in California. She wias 90
feet long, 18 feet beam and 6 feet hold.
She had a single engine, 13%. inches bore
nnd i% feet. stroke of piston, with an old
style firebox tubular boiler. She was a
good, etroner boat, bat not very fast. The
freight was carried in the- hold, and:. the

His general features denote a man of en

Zn speaking of boatbuilding; In the early
days, the captain said: "The contrast be
tween then and now Is very great and no
doubt It will seem amusing to shipbuild
ers of the present to know what kind of
craft wÂ« h&d In those days. Before com
ing to Ban Francisco I had worked as an
apprentice In the shipyard of Mathew
Van Duzen at Philadelphia, who was a
very good man â one of the best. I began
In 1X40. when I was 13 years of age. I was
born in Venezuela and came to Philadel
phia from that country. I arrived in San
Francisco on September 18. 1849, on the
steamer Oregon. She was built In New
York, and was one of tire three steamers
built for the Paclflc Mail Steamship Com
pany â the Panama and the California be
ing the others. There came with me Ja
cob Albertson, a boatbuilder; Jacob Price
and William Kendall, ship joiners; Hugh
May, Joseph Alderman and Nat Thomp
son, engineers, and Captain Isaac Warren.
I came out with the intention of estab
lishing a shipyard here, and was employed
to put together a small sternwheel steamer
which had been built in' sections in Phila
delphia and shipped here on tne Oregon by
George W. Asplnwall, brother of H. As
plnwa.ll of the Pacific' Mail Steamship
Company. The day after our arrival we
landed the material of that steamer and
began to put it together. My shipyard, as
it may be called, was on the beach Just
south of Folsom street and east of Beale.
the water came up to those streets In
those days.
"Well, to get back 'to the first boat,"
said the captain. "In about two months
we had built that steamerâ the first built
Jule. Into the sidebar where .it's standin'
in the dark onder a shed; an' "then, hook
in' up old bobbin a heap surreptitious, I
gathers the reins an"' we goes softly P'&t

he's jest aliveâ an' I'm shore amazed. But
I yanks him up a lot an' starts anew. It's
twenty rodsi when Dobbin bolts ag'in.
This time I hears a flutter an' reaches
Jule some to see if her petticoats
is whippih* the wheel. They ain't; but
Juleâ who esteems said gesture., in the
nacher of 'a. caressâ^seemin' to favor the
idee,^ I-, lets my arm stay 'round. A mo
ment, later. -an' this yere villain Dobbin
bolts the' third time, an' as I've sort o'
got my one , arm tangled up .with Jule a
heap, he lams into a oak tree.
" 'It's then, when we-all is plumlyto al
halt. I doeaheara flutter. At that/ gets'
down to investigate. Gents, you-all may
jedge of my horror when I finds 'leven of
my shawl-neck game chickens roostin" on
that sidebar's reach! They're thar when
we pulls out. They've retired from the
world an' it's care for the night, an', in
our ignorance of themSchicken's domestic
arrangements, we. nacherally takes . 'em
with us. . Now an' then, as we-all goes
rockln' along, one of 'em gets jolted off.
Then he'd- hang by his chin an* beat his
wings; an' it's these yer frenzied efforts
he makes to stay with the game that
evolves 'the fluttering I hears.
" 'Juleâ who don't own chickens an' who
ain't no patron of cockfights neitherâ is
for settin' the shawl-necks *on the fence
an' pickin' 'em up as we trails back from
the gander-pullin'. â¢
"'"As long as It's dark,'i says Jule,
"they'll stay planted; an' we rounds 'em
up tos easy on our return."
" 'But I ain't that plumb optimistic I
knows these chickens an' they ain't so
somnolent as all that. Besides it's a
cinch a mink or. a fox comes squanderin'
'round an' takes 'em in like gooseberries.
'Leven shawl-necks! Why; It would be a
pick-up for a fox!
" ' "You're a fine Injun to take a girl
to a dance!" says Jule at last, an'*she's
full of scorn. . '
" ' "Injun or no Injun," I retorts a heap
sullen, "thar ain't no gander-pullin' goin'
to je'stify me In abandonfn' them 'leven
shawl-necks, an' me with a main to fight
next month over on the Little Bloo!"
".'At that I corrals the chickens an' im
prisons 'em in the r'ar of the side-bar,
an' goes a weavin' back for camp. I picks
up three more shawl-hecks where they
sets battin* their he'pless eyes In the
road, as I returns^
"/But I shore hears Jule's views of me
as -'a beau! They're hot enough to broil
meat! Moreover, Jule tells all Sni-a-bar,
an' I'm at once a common scoff an' jeer
from the Kaw to the Gasconade. Jule's
old pap washes out his rifle an' signs a
pledge to plug me if ever ag'in I puts my

it befalls that when we-all is in the very

exaggeration to call a crisis in our des

twenty-three million gallon* and con
sumes most of it. More olive oil Is im

Btatea, though America has seven or
eight times the population of her sister
republic Thla fact, however, may In
Â¦ume measure be accqunted fur by the
enormous growth of thÂ» Industry la thta
ccuntry.
With the Anglo-Saxon tho tast* for
olives and olive oil 4s a cultivated one,
but araonc tho Lctln races tho love of
the olive tiecma natural. In Southern
Europe many a peasant makes a meal on
a handful of the dried berries, a chunk
of bread and a cup of wine, and flails
that he can do hard work on It, too.
For pickling the ManzarJUo and Mis
sion olives are excellently â¢suited, as also
Is the Spanish Regalls or Queen olive.
The olive expert prefers ripe olives, which
ere of much the same color aa a black*
heart cherry, for pickling; but the aver
age person has grown so accustomed to
cntlr.K green olives that dark ones do not
soil well. So to suit the taste or lack of
taste of the great public, the berries for
pickling are gathered in a green state,
before tho oil has begun to form, for any
discoloration renders them unattractive
to the eye and less marketable. To
pickle them, tho berries aro placed In
wooden vessels and covered with a strong
solution of lye, where they are left for
twelve hours. After being taken out they
are put Into fresh water every twelve
hours for nine or ten days, to tako away
tho taste of the lye. But aa even after
long soaking the bitterness remains they
ure passed twice through strong brine.
In the last water wild laurel leaves are
often placed, as they communicate a
pleasant flavor to 'the berries.

yields oil nf a low cr;ulo, which la sold to
manufacturers of soap, or Is used as an
Ingredient in illuminating and tubrfcatiug
oils. Oil improve!i with airo and may be.
kept for a Ion? time without deterioration.
Even after the third and hint pressing the
pulp has socclo value; It Is dried and used
as a feed Cor cattle, as fuel or as fertili
ser for the soil. Nothing Is wasted on a
well managed olive ranch.
There are oil presses of various lrfTTfls.

pulp is placed In a round mat of about
the diameter of a wagon wheel, or in fiat
circular bass m^f of sacking. At the
bottom of the press there is a strong
wooden grating on which rests a fiat
round iron plate with holes m it. One et
the pulp bags Is put on the plate, on- the
bag is laid another plate, then another
bag, and so on until six or seven bags are
piled one on top of another. The first
pressing Is gentle and Blovr, yielding what
la called virgin oil of the highest quality.
As it Is very readily contaminated by con
tact with Inf ertor oil or extraneous matter
it is conveyed to another part of the es
tablishment and let aside for about a
month, so that tt may slowly deposit ita

CROPIIjlK SUNDAY CALL.
8womanâ the daughter, of one of the oldest
arid wealthiest families of New Orleans
she was a lady in its truest sense â and
had her hands -full in regulating a batch
Df hoydensâ of which my guilty recollec
tions place me in no inconspicuous light. '
When we were all seated in the Immense
study hall, rather In the openâ lest the
desks should hide some mischievous
merry-making, the directress entered
while we stood; then some little mite
would give the signal and the y young
ladies were seated. The nun presiding
never addressed us other than as "young
ladles." The class consisted in the main
jewelry was allowed save a very small
brooch and one plain, inexpensive ring, so
that we were all on perfect equality. No
one among the pupils knew who was
wealthy or who was being educated for
sweet charity's sake; neatness was im
perative, and in passing out of the study
hall to the class rooms each day, the
hands had to be extended, palms up, and
the fingers doubled in to show the nails. A
pair found in mourning received a little
tap of the ruler as a reminder.
But, back to the "polite class."
In this country, where- fortunes are
made in a day, where the son of a la
borer has a chance of becoming the na-
of lectures on courtesy. The deference
to be shown by young people to those
older than themselves,' and the manner
of interchanging courtesies among the
pupils. This woman, rarely cultivated,
and extremely handsome and dignified of
bearing, was a magnificent specimen of
cultured, refined womanhood, and was a
foe' to anything like snobbishness. The
pupils, were permitted only the plainest
of good wearing school dresses, and no
teenth century It was only used to
designate a bell which wa3 struck at cer
tain periods of time indicated by the hour
glass. Sundials or "gnomons" were the
first instruments used in measuring time
and there is but little doubt that the long'
granite pillars which we call obelisks were
used by the Egyptians if not as actual
sundial hands, at least for some astro
nomical observations of the movement ot
the sun. Clepsydras or Water-clocks and
sand clocks come next In order. The How
of sand through a small orifice is an ac
curate method of measuring time, for the
exit of the sand is always regular; but
water is influenced by the laws of hydro
statics; when the vase' is full the water
runs out faster than when it is nearly
empty. Candle-clocks, or tapers on which
were colored bands indicating how mucU
was consumed in a certain time, were also
used, and their invention is attributed to
Alfred the Great; but this method is even
more susceptible of error than the pre
vious ones. In most large cities a public
record of the flight of time seems to have
been kept by some method or other. In
128G St. Paul's in London paid a salary to
an orologiario, who kept a record of time;
and in 1371 we find one employed at West
minster Palace to attend to the clock.
The first portable clocks are attributed to
a German named De Souabe, and are sup
posed to have been made in 1300; but it is
not till 1480 that we find mention of a
clock made so that "he might carry It
with him, to every place whither he might

AN ARGUMENT
FOR
THE STUDY
OF
ETIQUETTE
And where does the home instruction
come in? Is not the home the proper
schoolroom for such lessons?
Such instruction as the public schools
have to give along these lines should be
covered in the earlier years, while the
child is passing through the primary and
grammar grades.
Nor do I think that it should be. High
schools Vre mot for the purpose of teach
ing good form. They are intended for the
purpose of teaching English and mathe
matics 'and chemistry and many other
similar and dissimilar branches, but not
morals and manners.
Of course, it is customary to give inci
dental lesspns in politeness. When the
rules of good form are infringed upon by
a pupil, that pupil is given instruction on,
the subject. But- as for teaching polite
ness as a special branch, that is not re
quired in the course of study.
Morals and manners are not taught as
a special - subject in the high schools of
this city, and I do not think it would be
advisable that they should be.
BY FRANK MORTONâ
Principal of Lowell High School.
As for spending any more time thatÂ» is
already spent in the teaching of polite
ness, I repeat that I consider it out of the
question.
I believe that children will acquire much
by imitation. Our teachers are ladles and
gentlemen; their example helps largely to
make the Children ladies and gentlemen
likewise.
The home is the place where manners
should be taught. Tou say that many
parents are incapable of giving such in
struction. True enough: but here we get
into a deeper problem which is economic
rather than educational. My' answer is:
THE HOMES MtST BE MADE BET
TER. When this Is accomplished, when
the slums are elevated, then the school3
will not be expected to give much time
to morals and manners.
All of our teachers give such Instruction
as this by precept and example, but as
for going far into the usages of polite
society, it is impossible. I do not believe
that It would be In any way feasible to
teach table manners in the public schools.
There is no time for anything of the kind.
As far as is possible, politeness la
taught in our chools. The time that can
be devoted to such lessons is limited; that
is why still broader results cannot be
achieved. Morals and manners cannot be
taught to the exclusion of the three R's.
Most of the lessons in politeness are given
incidentallyâ there is no time for much
more. For instance, a boy comes to- school
with his shoes unlaced. He i3 given a
lesson then and there on slouchy habits.

CONDUCT LESSON
AS SEEN IN
A REPRESENTATIVE
CITY SCHOOL
By SARAH COMSTOCK,
The teacher is a woman who lives
through a twenty-four hours' day and at
tempts to accomplish in that time the
work of twenty-five. However,- the "sug
gestions" are made and it is up to her.
This is practical work. Theoretical work
is given in all the schools â quotations and
rules are taught, bearing upon kindness,
order, generosity, * neatness, and so forth.
But to what extent this is all carried out
depends upon the teacher, for there is no
definite and regular lesson insisted upon.
It is recommended that all such instruc
tion be incidental and made applicable to
cases in _ hand. The course of, study pro
vides an outline of suggestions for each
grade. These are largely abstract and are
made concrete only if the teacher has tho
ingenuity. Behavior at -home and in pub
lic places as well as in the schoolroom are
supposed to be taught; respect for those
in authority,' for old age, reverence for
God, these and dozens of other points,
not including table maners, are mentioned
in the "suggestions."
Later on the schoolroom aisle became a
street and two ladies, walking down the
street, met two .gentlemen. What did the
gentlemen do? forsooth, but lift
their hats while the ladles bowed charm
ingly. Â»
A woman with a baby, and no seats for
her! Again tho really truly gentleman
rises. "
In tho next scene a doll appears. One
of the little girls enters the car -with the
doll in her arms.
A gentleman, a really truly gentleman,
rises. He offers his seat, removing his hat.
Heroine thanks him and is seated.
The street-car act was still more popu
lar and actors offered themselves with
waving hands. Two benches facing each
ether constituted the car seats. Passen
gers took their places along them; a grip
man gripped a broomstick; enter the hero-
This time matters went smoothly. The
boys waited until the girls entered the
elevator, then - followed, removing their
hats.
"Ladies first," he was reminded.
The little girls entered the elevator. One
boy attempted to cram in along with
them and was promptly sent back.
The platform was the elevator. Scene
shifters got unnecessary furniture out of
the way.
The theory was accepted as correct.
Thereupon some actors were chosen for
the elevator drama.
"A gentleman should take off his hat."
Joe knew.- Joe, I found, always knew
everything and was making a specialty
of being good to keep fro'm being bad, his
other specialty.
"What should a gentleman do when a
lady is in the elevator?"^ asked Miss
Sprague.
Miss Stincen, her principal, came into
the room and helped out in the conduct
lesson. It is a sugar-coated pill. It is
almost as much fun as the Sunday-school
Christmas entertainment.
I happened in on a day when the ele
vator lesson was being given.
Choose at random again and it was Miss
Sprague's roÂ©m. She has a fifth grade.
The initiated know and the uninitiated
may be told that fifth-graders are alwaya
the saddest lot of ugly ducklings that any
schoolroom holds, 'although plenty of
them will turn out swan-like enough
while the mills of God continue to grind.
They are the boys and girls who are just
too old to be "cute" and just too young
to be Interesting. They are each burden
ed with two arms and two legs and there
is nothing 5 to do but bear them. Their
older sisters and brothers have come to
be useful, the younger ones are still con
sidered but nobody thinks
that a- ..: fiTthXgrader is either and they
acknowledge | themselves unappreciated.
Because of all these things Miss Spragua
finds plenty of material to work upon.

Â¦ In .Washington, where men from all

Is often painfully transparent. The stage
has elaborated with exaggerated gro

easily traceable to eccentric characters
that hlbe'rnate.in the nation's capital. Of
course, these characters are supposed to
be the choice spirits of the locality that
proudly select and elect them, to repre

politeness fairly emanates from them,
and, strange to say, the men show

than do the women. In. the majority of

more ambitious sometimes take private

At an easy gallop, pulling up occasion

hour. Then suddenly a shot was fired off
to the right of the trail, followed by oth
ers closer at hand. That first shot was
the one fired by the boy. The others
were fired at close range at the cowboys.

yelled Brockman. "They must have

Before he had ceased speaking every
man jn the outfit was charging, the same
thought thrilling them all.
"Come on, all of you," - said Dalton;
"but, remember, I'm carrying double, so
don't make it hot."
"Two or three of you lope on ahead a
piece and try if you can hear the wagon,"
Brockman suggested. "I'm sure getting
uneasy about that youngster. He can't
be far off now."
"We got out of this a heap better than
I expected," said Langford, who had been
counting noses. "Not a man hit. Bud
Willett's horse has got a bullet in him,
and my saddle horn Is smashed. That's
about the size of the damage."

"I can see part of it," Brockman said.
"It's the maverick that puzzles me. He
doesn't seem to figure. The old buck
skin got tangled up and turned over with
Benois. failing on top of him. Tou can
see from the way the head hangs that his
neck's broken. Benois worked from under
him, got out his gun and dragged himself
off toward that bunch of brush on the
bottom. Tou can read his trail easy. He
figured on their making a run out after
us. and his play was to get out of the
way. But this doesn't give us the maver
ick at all. He doesn't show between here
and the horses, so he must have tumbled
off between this and the ranch. From the
sign I reckon that Benois Is sure used
up bad." '. ,â¢
"If he made for that brush, if Â¦ likalr
he's there yet. We had better get him la
first," Dalton said.
"It's Benois' mount," Dalton said, as
they rode up to the prostrate animal.
"That's the last of his stumbling buck
skin."
They dismounted and studied the sign.
Although the horse was. lying on his side,
there were dirt and grass stains on J^e
horn and on the cantle of the saddle. TA
few yards back the ground was torn up.
as if a struggle had taken place there.
The Winchester carbine had been taken
from the leg scabbard and was missing.
Oft to one side there was a flattened spot
In the dew-damp grass, and leading away
from It to the northwest, toward a small
arroyo, the grass was beaten down where
a heavy object had been dragged oft. On
the other side, too, the grass had been
trampled, and still further to the south
was the broad trail made by the herd of
horses as they were driven out on the
divide. They examined the dead horse
carefully, even turning him over to search
for a wound, but none was found.
"What do you make of it?" Dalton
asked.
"The little fellow was behind Benois
on the right point as we turned 'em out
on the prairie," he said. "One of the
bunch tried to bolt back by me, and be
fore I got him headed right I lost sight
of them."
"Call Benois," Brockman said; "be may
know something."
Then the startling discovery was made
that Benois also was missing. They
couldn't have been shot down, for not a
shot had been fired In the hearing of the
cowboys. Benois would never have de
serted the herd without good reason, and
no reason presented itself to the minds of
the cowboys that could be accepted as
good. It was a Queer situation. Some
thing must be done, but no one could sug
gest what that something should be.
Daylight was beginning to show In tho
east when Brockman solved tne problem
to his own satisfaction.
"I'm going back to the ranch." he saM.
"They may both be there; and if thAy
ain't, why, we'll have to find their trail
where they turned off."
"I'll go with you,"" said Dalton. "The
others can bring In the horses at sun-up."
Just then a distant whinneying was
heard. It was answered from the bunch,
and repeated. Then came a clattering or
hoofs, and the herd turned toward the
ranch with heads up and ears extended as
a riderless horse galloped into sight. A
little distance away he halted and neighed
again, and then, as a familiar whinney
came in rÂ«ply. he plunged up and joined
the herd. It was the horse the maverick
had been riding, for on his back was the
old pueblo tree that Brockman had rigged
up for the boy.
"He's been thrown." said Brockman,
"and Benois is staying with him."
"Well, they won't be hard to find, it
that's all," said Dalton. "Unless your
maverick is hurt, there's no harm done."
"Come on,' then," said Ed, "and we'll
soon know what's up."
Half a mile from the ranch Dalton saw
a dark heap on the prairie to their left.
"That's either a man or a horse," said
he, pointing to it.
"It's a horse, all right," Brockman de
clared, "and there's something on It. That
hump looks like a saddle."
"Maybe the others know," said; and
they reserved their ride and questioned
each in turn. Only Virgil Allen had
noticed him at all. . â¢
Then lor . the first time it dawned on
Dalton that he had not seen the boy slnca
the alarm had been sounded by him.
"They'll burn the ranch," said Ringer.
"Not much," replied Dalton. "They'll
keep clear of that for fear we've left a
guard there." â¢
Ail this time the men were driving thej
horses at a gallop out on the prairie. OtJ^
the divide, a miie and a half from the
ranch, the herd was rounded up and
brought to a stand. Ringer and Brock
man having worked out on the points
and into the lead and headed the bunch,
ihere the cowboys rode around and
around them many times before Brock
man again ranged alongside of Dalton.
"Where's the maverick?" he asked.
"'They're working up the bed of the
creek to come on us from the cover of the
blackjack," cried brockman, as he gal-
Ioiieu up to the boss herder.
"That's wnat I reckoned they were up
to," said Dalton. "But we'll fool 'em.
Get the bunch up on the divide, and
they'll never dare to come within range
to take 'em."
"Turn them! Head them out on the
prairie!" Da. ton shouted as he galloped
in between the leaders and the crutk.
"Keep them moving lively! We'll maÂ«.e
'em come out in tne open to fight lor
them."
The night horses of the different relief*
all were picketed alongside the ranch for
just this sort of an emergency. At the
first call the cowboys tumbled out of
their blankets and sprang to their mounts.
They hardly were in the saddle when a
yell from Brockman brought the herd
horses to their feet and started them on
a run toward the ranch.

BENOIS AND THE MAVERICK DIS-
CHAPTER IX.
The boy, sitting now on the wagon seat
with a. gory corpse behind him, could
hear the yells growing fainter and fainter.
They soon would leave him as far behin-1
as he had been in the lead unless he hur
ried. The mules were willing again, sn
he turned them into the trail and
went on.
Suddenly he became aware of the pres
ence of other shadowy figures; these ap

btrangely enough, they all moved away
from nim and j.oward the trail. But that
other cieeping thing was getting neare:
and nearer all the time, and as he real
ized this, the boy, faint with fear, sank
back into his barricade. It was now not
more than ten yards away; now the tail
board of the wagon hid it from view. As
he wondered on which side he next would
see it, the form rose silently at the rear
and a painted face glared in at .him. He
had cocked the revolver and held it in
his trembling hands, afraid now to shoot
left he niirht miss.
With a grunt the Indian beckoned to
him to pet out. He did not move. The
Indian clambered in and reached for
him. There was an explosion; the Indi3:i
fell over upon him and clutched him by
the throat, but did no more. The revol
ver had gone off in good time and with
deadl;- effect-
There were a few convulsive kicks and
struggles, and then the boy squirmed
from beneath his bleeding enemy and
seized the lines, for the phot had started
the mules into movement. They were
easily held now, however, for they had
headed again toward the trail, and from
thtit direction there came a sudden shot.
a whoop and then a fusillade, interspersed
with cowboy yells and a trampling of
hoofs as they charged the ambuscade.
The Indians broke and ran and the cow
boys pursued.
"Xney are coming at last," he whis
perto.. lor it dawned on him that it wa^
Uic tuwoojs who had now disturbed tnc
hoot owis, and he gave- a sigh of relief
and rose to leave the barricade. As he
uiu, tnrough a slit in the canvas he saw
that whicn almost made his heart stop
beating. A dark form glided from the
thade of a mesquite bush, and. bending
low, started on a devious course lor the
wagon, trom the distant trail came the
sound of voices, faint at first, but grow
ing in volume as they drew nearer. To
the boy. his eyes fascinated by that mov
ing form, it seemed they must come too
late.
An hour went by.' To the boy In his
barricade it eeemea an eternity. He fan
cied he could see through the rents in
the wagon cover shadowy forms flitting
about in the brush; yet, though he lis
tened intently, he could hear nothing but
the beating of his own heart ana tne
panting of the tired mules. Then, away
back in the direction whence he had
come, he heard an owl hoot; then an
other, and then a whole chorus such as
had marked his own passage through the
scrub oak.
A sudden Jolt as the mules Jumped a
drain threw the boy from the 6eat over
the dashboard to the .wagon tongue. He
gripped the breeching of the near mule
as he fell and landed astride the pole.
The brush tore his clothes and the Bharp
thorns cut his flesh, but he clung on,
and pulling himself up got a-etraddle of
the near mule. Then he gathered the
lines and at the first pull the jaded ani
mals slowed down, and finally came
to a stand, blown and exhausvd. The
leaders dropped in their harness and
could not be induced to rise; the wheelers
tr<?ir limbs trembling. Bides heaving and
heads drooping were In a state of col
lapse.
The boy climbed back Into the wagon
and groped among the sacks of cornmeal
until he found the big revolver and a belt
of cartridges. Then he made a barri
cade of the provisions and crawled into
it. The cries of the wolves died away in
the distance, the moon rose bright and
full, and it grew light as day in the field
of mesq.uite.
Â¦ Â¦ u OR a 1 moment he made as If to

X him a-shiver and he dropped the re
\oiver back on the seat and leaned far
over the dashboard to lash the leaders.
The off muie in the lead, the most willing
one of the four, suddenly threw up his
head, cocked his ears, snorted, swerved
sharply to the right and drew the whole
team with him off the trail. In another
instant they were plunging helter-skelter
through the mesquite. thorns tearing the
team and the wagon cover, and the
stunted brush thrashing the bottom of the
wagon bed with a roar that startled coy
otes from their cover and sent them
howling on ahead like a vanguard of
demons.

The moon -was high In the heavens, and
und-r its mellow light the prairie to the
west had the appearance or an lmmenai,

"Here comes your cook." he said
"What's that?" Brockman demanded,

"The cook," the maverick repeated.
"They said she would come In that way."

Without a word Brockman turned away,
Dalton got out his glasses. Â¦ , .
"There's your maverick, Ed," he called
out a moment later., "And he's as right
as we are." - - -â¢ **
Brockman, who bad dismounted to In
spect the trail, turned hurriedly at this,
took a long look to make certain, and
then started on a run for the wagon. Tho
others followed. The mules saw them
and came to a stand. The boy looked
ahead and saw them, too. He rose wear
ily on the sent and waved his hand. As
they came up, he reeled and fell over
backward.
"He's hit," cried Brockman; "I saw
blood on him." . ...
In two jumps he was on the wagon.
The others saw him reach forward to
pick up the boy, and then start back In
surprise. Next minute he had the boy in
his arms and was on the ground.
"I knew he was the right sort, the little
cum!" he shouted. ; "Killed hie meat and
was toting It home to cure. Look in the
wagon."
They did, and found there the stark
corpse of a. Klowa warrior.
"What's the matter with you?" Brock
man asked, as the boy opened his eyes.
"You ain't hit as I can see.'* .
"Just tired, I guess," murmured the lit
tle chap faintly, and off he went again.
"The excitement of-tne ride with that
there was too much for him," Bud Wil
lett said, jerking his thumb toward the
wagon.
The Klowa was thrown out and a bÂ«d

driven into the "chinks between the wall
logs. The "dining"- room also was fur
nished in primitive fashion, the table hav
ing been constructed in. the same manner
as the beds, except that It had pieces of
plank laid across the slats instead of bides
and blankets.
Brockman was slicing bacon in the
kitchen when the maverick came out' of
his long sleep and began to study his sur
roundings. There were no windows In the
apartment in which he found himself, and
no -door had yet been hung in the space
left for it when the ranch was put up.
Through the opening where the door
should have been came the aroma of
steaming coffee. As it assailed his nos
trils the boy discovered that he was fam
ishing/and he rolled off the bunk and
stood In the doorway; He saw Brockman
in the kitchen, and walking Into that
apartment he studied Its rude equipment
with a curious interest. ' â¢ ;
"Well, sir. how do you find yourself feel

"Hungry," said the little chap.
"All right," said Brockman. "I'll fix you
out with some grub pretty quick now."
Then,- as he noted the wonderment in the
maverick's eyes, he added with a smirk:
"You'll have to excuse the look of things,
for, you see, we weren't expecting no vis
itors to-day. It's our cook's afternoon
out, too, and I dare say she'll go to the

"What's that?" the maverick asked.
"That? . Oh, that's- the wine we get

done with it. â¢ But there's your sow

' The boy nibbled' at the bacon and

|? AST week the readers of The Sunday Call had the opportunity
of seeing the observation test tried en some of the many peo
ii==sJ pie who nre personal friends of General Barnes. An effort was \
made to select persons from as many walks of lifs as possible and '
c'-no to obtain a fair representation from both se^es. It must be saidr
that as a general rule me^hbsrs ci the fair sex seem to be surer in
their descrip Liens of personal appearance or "identification" than do"
. men. Still effn with them there is a doubt. Try for yourself and
see if you can describe your best friend, of course not with him right,
before your eyes, so that Ai stranger to him could pick that friend
out cf a crov.'dcd room. Take th.2 man that you know best and see if
ycu can writs dorm ho-w old he is, and how tall, and how .much he
weighs, what the color of his hair is, and of his eyes, and then if
you can give any further characteristics. Jf you are fairly good at
that test go a little further and sec if ycu can take a pencil and
prpei and maks a memory sketch of him that looks at all like your
subject. Ycu will probably never get to the drawing stage unless
ycu are a trained artist, because you will find that you have failed
miserably in your description. It all goes to show' how much we
think we are seeing all the time snd how little we really see. It
also demonstrates why in criminal proceedings so much circum
stantial evidence of a contradictoiy nature appears when witnesses
must depend upon their own mental pictures for purposes of iden
tification. This -week we carry on the interesting test by a descrip
tion of Archbishop 3iordE.ii as ht really is, and follow it with the
descriptions of those who are sure they can describe him perfectly
â or at least have known him for a long time personally and should
be able to give an accurate identification.
"Now, as to his dress. It's black, of
course: but I never, noticed ' his jewelry
well enough to describe it.' He doesh't
wear anythirg but the Insignia ring and a
long chain. Of that I am certain.
"The shape of his face isâ wellâ now I
won't be certain on that point. If I had
a photograph I could give you an excel- "
lent description of him. I will say, how
ever, that his Grace has ' features that
show rare refinement. There is no pecu

ever noticedâ though he would impress
you anywhere as a prelate of the high

of men and things as well as an inborn
religious- fervor/ At a glance he ia the
prelate. No one could ever mis talc a him
for anything 'else. /
"His dress is characteristic and wholly
suggestive of spiritual absorptionâ as one
who gives little thought to clothes. On
the street, Â¦ as â¢ in .the house, he wears
black; - sometimes a sack coat -with aott
hat ; sometimes a â¢ Prince Albert with ' sills
hat and with both the pcrple stock.
"He never wears any other jewelry than
the episcopal ringâ on the third finger of
his left hand, I thinkâ and the long sol*
chain with cross attached."
"His dress, of course, is black, and he
wears no jewelry except the chain holding
the cross and the episcopal ring. I could
not be sure which hand he wears it on."
FATHER LOONEYâ
St. Charles Borrbmeo.
"Sure, and if I had a photograph I
could give you a very good description
of his Grace, "said Father Looney of St.
Charles Borromeo Church, '.'but for all
the Â¦ times I have seen him I couldn't be
lure of his eyes are blue or gray or brown.
And I couldn't tell you the color of hia
hair, though I think It Is -gray.
"He's a big man, of course; about six
feet tall, I think. No, I couldn't guess
how much he weighs.
"I'm not good .at descriptions, but hia
name is Patrick William Riordan. Of
that I'm very sure. He is about 60 years
old. but doesn't look it, for he jgalks fine
and erect.
"There are no scars about either his
hands or face. He is one of the hand
somest men I ever saw; a/ very manly
man; a man who could not fail to impress
even the least observing with is dignity
and spiritual calm.
"I have only been In San Francisco
about two months, and in that time I hava
seen Archbishop Â±tiordan just once," said
leather Moran, "but ne is a man who,
once seen, is never forgotten.
"His eyes are gray; very clear and pen
etratingâbut they look at you with the
greatest kindliness. His nose is fine and
straightâ of an even length. His fore
head is broad and highâ a splendid fore
head, denoting the scholar as well as the
prelateâ and his hair is just turning grayâ
an iron gray â anii is brushed back from
the temples on both sides.
"He is a tall manâ about my own height,
I thinkâ or perhaps a little taller. To be
exact, about six . feet one or two inches
tall. He^ls noP of a massive frame. He
weighs about 180 pounds. To me he looks
the athlete, even at his present age. whicn
I think is about 60 years.
"His full name is Patrick William Rior
dan, and "he was born in Canada.
"Hi3 dress I do not remember particu
larly, but I know about his jewelry. He
wears a cross and chain and a watch.
Also the Archbishop's ring which I. as a
rellgeuse, have been allowed to kiss. It
Is a beautiful amethyst set in gold and it
is worn on the third finger of his right
hand. I know it so well. And I have
observed his hands, too, when, kissing the
ring; they are small, smooth and a bit
plump.
"He walks with head and shoulders
erect; but he tips slightly to one side as
he walks. I think it is i toward the left
side." j/\\
rATHEB JONESâ /
St. Dominic's.
Father Jones has a pair of blue eyes
that look through you. Apparently they
do the same witn the Archbishop.
- "I know how tall he is," he said. "He
is Just six feet. I know t because once I
bumped into him and we were exactly on
a level.
"He weighs 160 pounds. I don't know
the color of his eyes, but I know that his
hair is brown and that it is thinning
slightly.
â¢His face is rather longâ but that point
is not as marked as the height of his fore
head. It is very high.
"I have never noticed any jewelry ex
cept the ring that he wears according to
his privilegeâ the ring that denotes hia
rank. Of course his dress in the pulpit
is according to the custom of the church.
In private life it is never twice alike. I
have seen him wear every kind of hat
from a soft boyish hat to a stately silk
one; every kind of coat from a short busk
ness coat to a Prince Albert. He never
appears to care much' how he looks. He
gives one the impression of being indiffer
ent to matters so trifling as dress.
\ "No, there is no marked peculiarity
about his appearance. If you met him on
the street you would not notice him. But
when you come to hear him talk you are
impressed with his commanding air, that
of a man who is used to leading.
"I have not the slightest idea what hia
hands are like. I never notice hands. He
has no scar that I know of.
"His walk is impetuous, quick; that or
a busy man who is always bent upon
something new, who has no time to waste.
"His full name is Patrick William Rior
dan, and he is a Canadian."
FATHER MOHANâ
"The most noticeable thing that I know
about him is his remarkable voice. It is
very round and sonorous. His face is long,
his forehead high.
"His hair and eyes are dark brown. The
hair is thlnnlnsr a bit. ~
Sister Mary shied charmingly at the
audacity of guessing about the Arch
bishop.
"I know so little about mankind," she
demurred, "how can I tell what he may
weigh or how high he may stand? I
weigh 108; therefore I should guess that
he must -be quite as much as 150, but I
have no Idea of what a man weighs. And
as to his heightâ that, too, puts me at a
loss. Is five feet nine considered a tall
man? Then let me say live feet nine.
"His full name is Patrick William Rlor
dan, and be was born in Canada. Ha
seems to be about 59 years old. .
"As to the shape of his faceâ well, now,
I cannot be certain whether it Is round or
square. His brow is broad and high, and
he has a tine straight nose. His face la
not such a one that you would study
feature by feature, xou would remember
It best for its gravity, and more than all
for an impressive grandeur that baffles
description."

"On the street he Is always dressed ta
blackâ a long Prince Albert coat, a high,

by Violet Twoedale in a novel called "Her

puzzle their noble heads ln vain, until the

LEST THB LOVED DEAD COMB BACK

Lefct the loved dead come back again.
Groping their way through the Infinite space,
Snatching a torch from among the bright stars,
To light a pathway unto thy face;
Lest they come back with unheard tread-
Be faithful ever unto your dead.
Lest the loved dead come back again.
Wearying for you In the world of bliss,
Long-Ing to wreathe you with unseen arma.
To seal you their own with the old-time kiss;
And with white fingers your hair to thread-
Be faithful ever unto your dead.
Lest your loved dead come back again,
Let not your heart to the living stray.
Lot a star-torch fall from cold, white hands.
Lest despairing the loved ones turn away;
Lest they come back with unheard tread-
Be faithful ever unto your dead.

Western author which is destined to at
tract considerable attention. Frances
Charles, a California n. has written a tale
of the Southwest, entitled "In the Country

"Blackbeard," a pirate who Is a real pi
rate in every sense of the word, is an
other character that more than holds his
own In the reader's attention. He it is
who steals Bonnet's ship and, further,
carries off the hero, dresses him up like a
ita?e admiral and swears that he will
carry him to his buxom daughter in
merry old England as soon as he can get
borne. Â«^
Zt would be a theme - to spoil a good
Â¦tory by telling; the plot In anythlns less
than Mr. Stockton's own words. The book
Is delightful from beginning; to end and
will make many a cheerful hour for many
a person In the days to come. The humor
Is clean, keen and delicious and there in
goodly quantity, while the story Itself for
dramatic Incidents and love Interest will
rank with any that has recently come to
our notice. "Kate Bonnet" is published
by D. Appleton & Co., New York. Price

â¢The Idol's Eye." Like the "Hoot Mon,"
Etockton'e Scotchman Is always turning
tip at the wrong time to thwart the well
laid piratical ecbemea of the amateur sea
robber. - V t .'
The tale commences with the ship about
to Ball and Bonnet burning to be on the
ocean broad and looked up to aa the ter
ror of the seas. The cSmplicatlons that
arise from the desire of the crew to eteal
his vessel from him 'are only but barely
forgotten when a real pirate seizes the
chip by treachery and makes Bonnet his
clerk. Bonnet finally extricates himself
from these etraits and pursues even a
more glorious piratical career in the fu
ture despite the efforts of his family and
the faithful Scotch servant who will not
leave him.
The Ftory Itself is even better than
"Mrs. I^erks and Mrs. Aleshine" for orig
inality of conceit. Stede Bonnet â father
of Kate, retired Kngllsh army officer, es
teemed sugar planter of Barbadoes, and
then bold pirate of the high seasâ is the
most thoroughly Stocktonesque being of
All. He gathers around him a ruffianly
crew of ex or would-be pirates, buys a
chip, and then the trouble begins.
The author's versatility in throwing the
possible ending of his story into a fasci
r.atiriR and va,guÂ« obscurity is only sec
onded !>y his pov.er in giving all his char
acters a distinct individuality in making
thrm one and all bo interesting that when
any one of them holds the boards for a
brief spell he or she is equally welcome.
As there is a doubt avrakened in the
reader's mind regarding the hero of Mr.
Stockton's intention so, at one time, it
Eeezns as UiouRh there must be a mistake
Jn the heroine: for Mr. Stockton divides
the honors very fairly between Kate and
a charming young maid who sticks' her
head out of the bushes on A. desert isle
end proceeds! to charm the hero and the
rcs<!cr .is well. -., ' â¢,\'-
At one time there are four possible
6u;tors for the heroine's hand, Mistress
Kate Bonnet, "The Pirate's "Daughter."
And the odd part about it is that the
reader's opinion is open to conviction in
favor of any one of them. Of course, this
all works out ripbt in the end, and then
you decide that all the time there was
only one m^n who really should have
Â¦won this estimable young woman, and
that ene was just the lucky man that Mr.
Stockton allowed to draw the prize.
"Kate Bonnet" once beÂ£un. you feel
that you must finish it just to see what
becomes of everybody. There is ; no
novel of the raft months that I can re
call to mind where fo many possible end
ings of the story present themselves as
In this latest book from Stockton's pen.
He does not say this man is good or
this one bad: nor does he in the slightest
\ray give a clew to what you may next
expect from .the people of his mimic life
â he gives them a start and then to all
appearances lets them look out for them
selves.
Stockton possesses In a marked degree
that talent bo rare in writers generally.
He makes the reader himself one of his
chaxactenj. This may sound a bit odd.
yet it is quite true. In "Kate Bonnet"
you feel that you are a part of the story
yourself. Your interest In the characters
Comes about naturally, and through what
the characters themselves have to say
"and not because of anything that the au
thor himself eays about them. Stockton
catches your interest with a tailing inci
dent or description and then, realizing
that he has you fast in the grasp of. cu
riosity, he lets you look to the character
Itself for the satisfaction of your hopes
'or fears.
ONE of the first books of the spring,
and one also that promises to be
well up near the top in the list at
hest book* of the year, is "Kate
Bonnet," by Frank R. Stockton.
This year it Is the same genial, interest
ing Stockton that we have known for the
years pastâ the author of "The Lady or

"Rudder Grange," that odd conceit. "The
Casting Away of Mrs. Leeks and Mrs.
Aleshine," an admirable book of short
stories last season, "Afield and Afloat,"
and a host of other tales and novels. His

able, but "Kate Bonnet" is more of a
treat, for you learn to know the charac

who has a country place near Elizabeth's
home, takes a fancy to Elizabeth and
invites her to spend a winter in New
York. Elizabeth goes to New York with
Mrs. Van Antwerp and becomes one ' of
the belles of the season. She wins the
love of a man named Julian Gerard, whom
she learns to love. At this time Halleck
makes a reappearance in Elizabeth's life.
He has made a great success as a singer
and has many opportunities of meeting the
beautiful Miss Van Vorst, as his wife is
known. Elizabeth has endured the re
newed attentions of Halleck, although she
refuses to publish the news of her mar
riage. She haB argued herself into the
belief that the formal bond between Hal
leck and herself need be no hindrance to
with each other. Before Halleck eroea
away he persuades Elizabeth to marry
him clandestinely by agreeing not to pub
lish the marriage until she shall wish it.
After Halleck j,'oes to New York he writes
less and less frequently to Elizabeth, until
his letters cease entirely. Elizabeth at
first Is heart-broken at Halleck' s incon
stancy. At last she realizes that^he hus
been only a passing fancy of f hla, and ho
is unworthy of her regard.

PRETTY WOMEN
OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS
AT WASHINGTONbroaden even without our clubs. But
they are ' the only possibility for these
rural women.
Mrs. Mowrle from Irvlngton told me
of the club that she belonged to. Its
members were from Niles and Irvlngton
and they met once every week to discuss
topics of the day and to read aloud boiiw
interesting book. This is what all women
of the small towns could do to make
tHelr lives brighter.
JOisf KATE BULKLEYâ
"Â¦President of the C. F. W. C.
As. I' look forward to (the new year that
we are entering uponâ the new year, that
Is, of the federationâ I realize that one
of our most important Â¦ objects is the
strengthening -of clubs "in the rural dis
tricts.
That is where clubs are needed. Ona
of their chief purposes Is to broaden us,
and the women of the country districts
are the ones who suffer most from a
cramped and narrow life. The cities of
fer much : contact even without the ara
of clubs; women can meet In other ways,
can be. cheered and encouraged by other
bright minds:, but a woman who lives on
a California ranch is so remote that her
life comes to be cast in a dreary rut. So
if she can have a club near enough to
Cf the California Club.

3&RS. ELLA SEXT6Nâ
As for the .theory thut our Insane asy
lums would not be, so full of/ California
women if clubs existed in rural district*
-I think there Is a 'great deal in it.
Lonely women brood and insanity re
sults. Clubs which would reach the
women af California nineties would do
uwuy with lonellntms and brooding.
Now as to the reform nyÂ«iÂ«Â«in prepesed.
There an* agents mjti agents. / '-.'â¢'
On this point depend* tho whole answer
to the Question raised: Shall we club
women of the cities send agents to tha
. rural districts to eetublltsh women's clubs?
the people appointed for this
. task be wise women, 'carefully chosen, 1
believe that, they could do more harm
than good. It would take Infinite tact
to reach the women of the outlying dis
tricts. They are not closely in touch with
the advanced and systematic work that
we are so accustomed to and they are
likely to be doubtful of the advantages
of it when they are first approached.
They must be handled skillfully and made
to feel that we wish them to work along
. with us as sisters^in the common cause
of education. It wfruld be a fatal error
'to make them feel that we are sending
teachers to them.. The common cause is
self-cultureâ note the emphasis on the
"self."
! The only proper way to choose these
agents would be to submit the matter
to the federation of the whole State ard
let them be officially chosen. Then there
could be no dissatisfaction and we should
know that a wise* and deliberate choice
had been made.
MRS. FRANK DALTONâ J
Kx-Fresident of tho Corona Club.
MRS. A. D. SHARONâ
Vice President of California Club.
Send out people to establish clubs In
the country? Dear me, I don't know why
we tihould, I'm aure, I can't say what
It might do In the way of lessening In
sanity, but I'm sura that tha country
women study and know more than we da
already.
We think ourselves a great deal eUv
erer than w* are. We sit In our city
homes and theorlzo about the needs of
our mentally starving statin far away;
while all the time these sisters arÂ» Â«o
excellently well fed mentally that they can
teach us a great many things worth our
learning.

rickety old vehicle and she drove to town
Ex-President of C. S. F. of W. C.
I have traveled among the different dis
tricts which compose the federation, and
I have been delighted at tho earnest spirit
that is Bhown by women of California's
small towns, and farms even. They are
in many cases so remote from any town
of size that it might seem impossible for
them to keep up the zest In work that Is
commonly Inspired by the coming togeth
er of many bright minds. But theae
women have worked In email numbers,
with Httle enough to encourage them.
They aro usually wives who have little
time to spare from heavy household du
ties, and all the more credit Is due to
them that they have snatched a few spars
mom. him for study.
MRS. ROBERT BTJRDETTEâ
Think how much better mothers they
would be, too v They could talk to their
children about something besides the
hunting of eggs and the milking of cowÂ».
If there Ma any practicable way of es
tablishing clubtt among them it ought to
liu done, The dltliculty of sending out
ugoius lÂ» the expense. Who will pay for
them? If the money can be provided, lee
wh have them, .' s
Their, homes would be happier. They
could, talk to their husbands about mat
ters of the outside world. The men get a
little glimpse of this 'now and then when'
they go into town and gossip. at the gro
cery and read the paper; but -the women
sec only the boundaries , of their own
farms.
If they, could write and read papers, If
they could have their libraries where they
could come for a quiet hour or so of
reading, what a relief it would be to
them! -',;'â¢ ' v "
Their lives are a long round of the
same thing. I wish I could see them all
having clubs that would take them out of
themselves. 1
No wonder , the women of. rural Califor
nia'go insane., So would I if I lived in the
way they do. So would you, so w'ould
anybody.
MRS/, E#CK L' DENNISTONr- v?
President of the Forum Club.
MRS. I. LOWENBERGâ
Presiden/of the Philomath 'Club.
Yes. I certainly do think that the broad
ening influence of clubs in the rural dis
tricts would lessen the cases of insanity
among women of the farms. /.
I believe, ' too, that, clubs should be
started and encouraged by outsiders; but
let those outsiders be the -district vice
presidents. With our federation divisions
of districts we can accomplish this work.
The divisions cover the entire State. The
vice presidents are stationed in a central
point of each district x and it should be
their duty to visit the remote parts with
in their boundaries and to encourage the
establishment of clubs In them.
There is no need of any other agents.
Who could appoint them? Certainly not
individual clubs. The work must be done
by the federation as 'a whole.
The country women need help. Let them
have it. :r- â¢ : V*ff> '. 'Â¦
If clubs could b.e established far and
wide through such regions, what a leav
ening power they would be!
I cannot risk an opinion on the question
of the club versus insanity. It Is a sub
ject that I have not thought of. and it
seems to me lo be the sort of question
that speculation cannot answer. Experi
ment will have to settle the matter.
It Is a Question that has often been
asked, but it need never be asked again.
The recent convention has shown. If for
nothing else, it was worth while for the
good that it did these women from re
mote parts of the State. It gave them a.
breath of fresh air mentally; it revived
their tired minds.
What is the good of federation?
They have their clubs now, to some ex
tent. How much It would be to them If
more could be established, if they could
have new thoughts brought into the
routine of their dreary lives!
It was a woman from one of our Cali
fornia villages who Bpoke, and thnse of.
our city club women who heard her will
never forget the fervor with which she
said it. We all realized how much the
convention was to us, but we saw then
that it was Infinitely more to the lonely
women of the small towns and ranches.
"You don't know what this convention
has been to us!"

Ex-President of the Sorosis Club.
my duty and privilege to visit those dur
ing the year if they want me. Three- of
the districts are in our vicinity, in what
may be considered the center of the State;
the other three are *more remote. It Is
where the villages lie that I hope to. do
the most. The women of these .small
places need help from outside, a stimulus,

they would surely gain the Impression
that we considered ourselves such. When 'â¢*

good intentions. We want to encourage
them to be one with us.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
I think it would be a great mistake > to â¢
â¢send agents into the rural districts to
establish clubs. ;,Â¦ r \
Not that the rural districts do not
need the clubsâ they need them sorely.
But: the matter should be approached in
another way. /
Suppose that we! city women,. with the
best intentions in the world, 6houldjÂ«end
out women to the. villages of Calif ofinaâ
women from among ourselves, having no
â¢ knowledge whatever of the existing con
ditions In the field of labor. What would
be the result? Failure.
Let the women of the country found
their own clubs. ""They can do it better
than we can do it for them. In every
S district can be found at least one woman
of enough intelligence to outline study
for a group of her neighbors. She knows
; them, their tastes, ' their needs. She - can
build up a club ; and make a success
where a stranger would make a failure.
Another pointâ what would the country
- women think of . us? " We should -appear
- like missionaries to the heathen, and
MRS. H. HEYNEMANNâ
....... 1st Vice President Philomath Club
Let the country women found their own
clubs. -They will enjoy them more than if
agents from the cities do it for them.
They would never consider the clubs en
tirely the4r own if started In that way.
The country does need clubs,-. that Is cer
tain. Perhaps we of the cities might ap
point visitors to go to the remote districts
and give encouraging talks on the sub
ject, but that is as far as we should Inter
fere.
The place of meeting is a problem in
many districts. Why not use the school
house? If it can be reachedby the chll
. dren, it certainly can be" reached by the
parents. And the school yard would be a
fine, place to leave 'the youngsters while
their mothers met inside.
For the youngsters must in many case3
be taken along:. I visited'a township club
a while ago; the place of meeting looked
like a country fair. Rickety old rigs were
coming from all directions; many of them ,
overflowed with babies. The children *
could not be left at home, so they played
to their hearts', content in the yard dur
ing the club meeting. .
DR. DOROTHEA MOOREâ
Of the California Club.
Beyond this, I don't see what the city
clubs can do to help them. They must
work out their problem of broadening f 01
themselves. V -"

new lineâ perhaps, too, they would gt

they are far deeper.
We have so many â¢ things to attend to
in our complex city life that we can't
go very far into anything. We take up
fads. We follow one thing for a day, then
drop it for something newer. Country
women don't do that. J^
. They have" fewer N interests, therefor*
they give more time to each one in par
ticular. They have "a chance to specialize,
and the result Is a thorough understand
ing of the subject undertaken.
I think they might better send agents
to us than we to them.
The great need is of more "clubs for
such women. There are plenty of them
who would prove themselves as deeply In
earnest as she. . .
She is a: lesson .'to -all of us. I wonder
how many of the women of city clubs
,would do as much? It is an easy matter
for them to take a street car or a carriage
at their door; but would they be as brave
as this woman If the nearest club lay
eighteen miles away over a bad road? .

MRS. Q. W. BUNNELL-7
. President of the Oakland Club.
We have more Insane women in Cali
fornia than in any State in the Union,
proportionally. '.;-/.
We must do something about it. The
first thing is to inquire into the cause.
It is a saying so trite that it is true:
"A woman's work is never done." Go to
OTTR insane women and what to
do for them â here is "new light
on the subject.
The club women are taking the
matter under discussion. They claim
to have found a way.
What do you think of itâ of estab
lishing women's clubs in rural dis
tricts to prevent the women from
filling our insane .asylums? (A man
is here heard to suggest that their
husbands would in that case attend
to filling the asylums, but the man
was not called upon for any remarks
on the subject and he is herewith
silenced.)
It is a fact, you know â a fact
proven by statisticsâ that nowhere
do so many women go insane as in
California, and they are largely the
women of lonely and remote dis
tricts. Isolation is what does it.
When these statistics were an
nounced and the club . women heard
them they said "Poor things 1" in
chorus. Then they went about ad
vancing a theory. -.;. â¢
They theorized that if isolation
causes these cotuftry women to go
insane, the way to prevent insanity
is to prevent isolation, and the way
to prevent isolation is to establish
women's clubs.
On this page you can read some
of their arguments on the question.
A group of our club women herewith
discuss the need of clubs in the rural
districts; also the ways- of satisfying
that need. ?T"/*?--
Listen to them for yourself. You
will find plenty of pros and cons as
welL f
Conventions are a great * inspiration to
the country women; they . see 'iwhat the
city clubs are doing and they gain new
ideas from them. We of the cities can
help ' them In this way. We can also
send them papers which will interest and
stimulate them. It would be a good
j-lan to have a 'regular system of send
ing papers that had been read in the city
clubs to khese outsiders for their read
ing and discussion. Such articles might
I have a belief that a need takes care
of itself. When the women in remote
places need clubs, they will form them
foi themselves. They are doing it all
the time and they will continue to do so.
MRS. WALTER H. BYINGKTONâ
President of the Mills Club.
Tfo 'doubt, the' country districts need
clubs, but I don't think It Is our business
to form them.
When the women of rural California
have their clubs our insane asylums will
have a shorter roll of patients' to, call.
Let these remote women have their
clubs which will bring them together and
they will cease tp brood. Their minds
will be stirred to new trains of thought.
The monotony will be broken and they
will be saved from mental ruin..
iJet us send out agents into these dis
tricts to found clubs among them. It is
our mission. We women of broader lives
owe this to our : sisters.
It Is just here that the value of'clu\:
comes In. Â¦ â¢-

go Insana? !-Â£VJ?
r Their work is as monotonous as on any
other farms, and their loneliness 7s far
greater, for the ranche^ are so immense
that it is hard to reach neighbors. They
think over the same things day in and
day out and they have no relief of con
tact ;;-:r"V . ,

MRS. ADA H. VAN PELTâ
Secretary Local Bed Cross.
Of course the establishing of clubs la
rural districts Â¦ would keep many women
out of the. insane asylums. The social
want in human nature is always there
and when it is not . satisfied madness
many a time results. .
You see I emphasize the social side of
club life. In its value to country women
I think this side is quite as important as
the educational. The loneliness 'of Cali
fornia ranch life is one of the saddest
Hhings in our Western \ world, and sta<
tlstics show how "dire Its results are. ,
There are. no women so remote ;.that
they cannot reach . a ' club. . It may i com
prise only three, or four members who
can reach a common meeting place.' If
these women are encouraged ! they can

he has served in the capacity of pastor of
the Catholic church in Smartsville, Tuba

Father Coleman in this city and the news
cf his drowning was a shock to the many
friends he had made here. He was an
active and devoted Christian worker and
noted for his kindly acts.
Father Twomey was busily engaged in
establishing a church at Dobbins Ranch,
and made many trips between Smartsville
Â«.r:d that place. Often had he crossed the

Twomey, pastor of the Smartsville Catho

this city by telephone this afternoon.
Father Twomey, driving a double team
from Smartsville to Dobbins, approached
Dry Creek at 10 o'clock this forenoon, at
a. point about two miles west of the old
electric power house and six miles from
lirowns Valley. He attempted to ford the
etrearn, which was high and running
swiftly. M. V. Hendricks, who lives near

Maxon at 2:35 a. in. Conductor Stockwell re
ports that the speec) was not fast at the time
of derailment, and is of the opinion that the
derailment -was due to an obstruction on the
track. Two day and mall cars, one coach, one
chair car. three .tourist sleepers and .one first
claap eleeper Â¦ were . completely destroyed .by
flre. Â¦ Â¦ :
Conductor Stockwell .also reports that'll*
has retained his .tickets and train sheet and
that the number of. killed and survivors tallies
therewith, thus accounting for every parsenger

As I ' understand it we were comlngr around
a reverfee .'curve in the form of a letter a
when the train left the track. The- engine
left the track on - account of the . high rate
of speed at .which' we , were.- going. I was
asleep at the . time ' the accident happened. My
wife heard the' noise of ;'the engine, going over
the rails and the next; thing Iwas awakened
by a , heavy jolt .of .the. cat.- â¢ .As- soon- as 1 our
car came to a stop I looked out of the window
and saw the whole country' lighted up. Â¦ This
shows .how quickly., the cars -took flre. ' ' The
groans of the iniured . canie ,\to ' my 'tears, '-. and
It was awful. To my, Ia3t day. 1'wHl never
forget that scene of suffering 'and destruction.
The heat from the burning cars was intense
and after the flames â¢ got fairly started the
crowd was forced to keep well back. I think
that the gas apparatus for heating was the
cause of '.the flre starting so soon. There were
many acts of heroism performed at the wreck.
Men risked their lives in the flames to save
some unfortunate who had been wounded and
could not move without assistance. In the
Oliver . Morosco, manager of the Bur
bank- Theater'- in- .Los Anxelca, tella a
thrilling story.' of the wreck. He says: Â¦
Morosco Tells the Story.
"When the crash, came almost every
one but the trainmen, was asleep. I had
Just retired. I-do not know at what speed
the 'train <-' was running, but realized that
something was Â¦ up before i the train
Jumped. I, felt the .engineer handle . his
fcteamand throw sand on the rails as If
to check up. ...The, next instant all but ono
car |, left the track and the . excitement
commenced." â¢ Â¦ . 'â¢Â¦.; j; v - â¢;Â¦ ;Â¦
Many persons testify to having heard
tho . air as tho engineer attempted >tb
apply tho brakes. Some suy that ' ho
Bunded the rails and probably reversed
his lever at the. last moment, .for at'least
ono man, *Thomas , F. Ryan, who occu
pied a' : 'jprfyuto" car,' says that there; was
a distinctly /felt, bump Just before,; the
train left â¢the ', track. â¢ Pullman Conductor
C. I. (MelgsV who was one of the few per
sona awako when tho accident occurred,
asserts that he heard the engineer at
tempting to check tho speed of his train.
He said. Â¦ .
At. a late hour this afternoon Dr. Tur
ner, the railway surgeon in charge of tho ;
wounded, announced that> all would ' re-!
cover. The. most seriously injured are at
the Catholic Hospital. The theory *is how
advanced ..that the. wreck was. due/to fast
running.. P.assengers who -were, awake
just;prior to the, wreck say that the. train
went down . the long grade at a- furious
rate, and as they were" running two hours
behind ..schedule ' tlmo .tho engineer was
endeavoring, to make up time. The theory
is that AKMast, who was known as one
of tho. coolest-headed engine-drivers in the
service, 'would have checked up before
reaching the double curve, but when tho
air, .brakes Iwere applied he . found . that
they "would- not work and lost control of
tho 'train. Â¦ . ;
claimants for damages, and thus forestall
tho lawsuits that are almost- sure to re T
suit, for the hospitals and /hotels are
crowded with injured, some of whom, are
in a critical condition. The Southern Pa
cific-offered to compromise v/ith Â¦ Mr. ' and
Mr3. M. L. Biddle- of ~ Marion,, Ohio, lor
the loss of their two children. . The offer
was. not accepted/by the Biddies, who
would not consent to 'even! consider it.
They had just sold out their-home and
were on their way to California to, locate.
Had it not been for the fire the casualty
lists would have been much smaller. The
cars broke apart and fell in such a posi
tion that they 1 did not jam' one another
and break to pieces, but their wheels
stuck in the ground and all were in fairly
good condition after the shock, and most
of the rolling stock would have been fit
for service again with but slight repairs
had it not been that the flash of the fire
was almost instantaneous. 'Several of the
cars were consumed before their bruised
and partly unconscious Inmates could be
taken out The fire resulted from the ex-
Fire Increases Casualties.
By to-morrow the wreckage will be
cleared __away. No bodies were recovered
to-day. * Only a number of charred bones
were found to represent all that was mor
tal of the persons who per
ished in the wreck. According to all 'ac
counts of the wreck, gathered from nu
merous victims of the disaster now in the
city, the smashup was not near
so serious as it was depicted. Only four
â¢jf the cars turned over, and none of them
were splintered.
Tho front , earn were filled with people
end not many . of those escaped. Tho
tourlHt Bleepcrs %yerc 'alflo full, but tho
loss of life there was small. Nono of tho
Pullman pasacngern were lost, but up
toward tho front of the train In the first
tourist car, tho smoker and chair car, tho
destruction of life and, the injuries to
thoso who escaped death were fearful to
contemplate. One injured passenger, who
crawled out through a window at tho last
moment, stated that Just before leaving
the burning shell he counted nine badly
injured persons left behind. There were
twenty-seven in the chair car and twelve
in the smoker. All of these were probably
burned.
Where the' Loss Was Heavy.
In all probability no accurate list of
those who lost their lives will ever be
compiled. No bodies except those of the
engineer and fireman were recovered. The
others were in the cars and even the
bodies of Home and especially thoso of
small children were reduced to ashes.
There was no list of passengers on the
train. Many were unknown to their fel
low travelers. The official list compiled
by the railway ofilcials gives only the
names of those who were accompanied
by some friend or relative who could cer
tify that the missing persons were on tho
train. Little doubt exists that many
others were . lost who will never be In.
quired for and whose death will remain
unrecorded. ,â¢ '

Spring Time the. Best Season
of the Year to Treat Chronic
Catarrh.
Notwithstanding that a. great number
of people have been cured of chronic
catarrh by taking Peruna during . .the
past cold season, yet it cannot be. denied
that the cold, wet, stormy has
retarded many cures, and, in some cases,
actually prevented a cure.
But springtime has ( come at last, and
now is the time for all catarrh sufferers
to begin a systematic course of treat-
ment for this disease. The greatest diffi-
culty In tho way of treating chronlo
catarrh is . that the patient is so liable
to catch cold during tho treatment and
thus delay a cure, ...
This liability at this season of theyear
Is, In a great measure* removed, and no
one should neglect the opportunity to
luko treatment, <;Â«^ .â¢
Poruna la acknowledged by every one
to bo the 'only reliable and unfalltr.a

located, When. you tuke Peruna you art

remedy, .

tion as well as thousands In the humbler

"I can 'hardly fir.d words that can ex-
press my thank3 *o you for what your
remedy has done for me. I have been

Last suminer Harry B. Culbort caiAe to
Ean Francisco from Portland, Ore., In
i;uest cf work. He was ambitious to make
money; ar.d at iast secured employment
as a conductor on a street-car line. While
in this position he learned of Ismar's
wonderful abilities, and sought her .ad-
Vice as to his future course. She told him
that he wouid socn have' an opportunity
to acquire an Interest in a gold mine on
the most trivial conditions. That while
the incident would seem unimportant' at
the time, it would lead to great wealth
if he took advantage of it; if he rejected
this opportunity he would always be
poor.
About two months later he happened
to meet an old boyhood friend, who asked
him for the lean of J20, saying that he
w?j about to go prospecting for u goM
mine, ar.d that he would give Herry Cul-
lj<rt a half interest In whatever Ire
mlRht realize from his venture.
Cuibcrt loaned him .the money, remem-
bering lt;m:ir'fi murveluus words and
ihlnkniK tlmi this wan doubtless the in-
CidÂ«8t Â»)iu haiV foretold.
About b!x months ceo he received a M-
tor from Ms friend cnying that he had
Btruck It rich in Northern California, und
requested Cuibcrt to come to thu scer.o
immediately. To-<lay .Cuibcrt is a .very
wealthy man, und was recently married,
which wan also In accordance with ls-
m.'ir's prediction.
His sold mine proved rich beyond his
most eXtravas&ot dreams, and .ho at-
tributes his pood fortune entirely to la-
mar's remarkable delineation of his fu-
ture.
He frankly nnd manfu..y acknowledged
to a reporter in an Interview at his hotel
joBtcrday that it was entirely due to 1s-
xr.ur's uOvlce that he embraced thu oppor-
tunity that made him a rich man. In
fact, he seemed proud to plve to Ismar
the full credit for his pood fortune, not
only in his business, but in his domestic
affairs, and sa'.d that lie was plad to al-
low her to print the incidents that led to
his rise to sudden wealth to convince

Men give away their pass out checks
and the result Is often an undesirable per
son at the dance. But should a man de
sire to give away his pass out sign he
could not. A mark In the hollow of the
hand cannot be transferred to the hollow
of another hand. An crfoft to make the
Blft at the best would only show that the
person with the borowed mark had re
â¢ ceived It wrongfully and was a deadbeat
This plan Is the Invention of a member
of the Worcester police force who has had
much experience, as door tender, at pub
lic dances. He says It works to a charm
Of course an occasional disagreeable per
son objects to being stamped, but such a
one receives a double option. He can stay
In or he can stay out.
The new device .Is a small rubber
stamp, usually about three-quarters of an
inch square. The man who wants to come
back does not under this system receive
a check, or his ticket with the corner torn
off, but he turns one of his hands palm
upward and In tho hollow of his palm tho
officer on the door imprints the stamp.
When he comes back he shows his hand
to the officer and the mark of the stamp
Is there as incontrovertible evidence that
he is the one who went out.
-The return check is not what it used to
be. The theaters still use It. but those
who give dances are finding it an lneffl^

and schemes of those professional dance
goers whose ambition is to make their
faces serve the same purpose as other peo
ple's money. : S =

Fewer Lives Lost Last Tear Than
Any During a Quarter of
a Century.
For persons who sail thÂ« seas the last
year was fraught with less danger than
any year since 1S75, says & I. Kimball.
general superintendent of the United
States Life-saving Service, In his annual
report. The loss of life from marine dis
asters last year was less than at any
time during the last quarter of a cen
tury. It was one life for every forty-five
marine casualties as compared with one
for every forty-one in 18S0, which was a
very favorable year.
The number of casualties to documented
vessels was 377. There. were on board
2841 persons, of whom but seven were lost.
The estimated value of tho vessels In
volved In disaster was $3,263,420, and of
their cargoes $2,405,033, making a total
value of property imperiled $7,354,000. Of
this amount $6,405,035 was saved and $943,
965 lost. The number of vessels -totally
lost wan forty-three.
In addition to the foregoing there were
during the year COS casualties to smalt
craft, undocumented, such aa small
yachts, on which were 927 persons, of.
â¢whom ten were lost. The property In
volved in these Instances is estimated at
$213,540, of which $160,240 was saved ami
$G3.3C0 lost.
Besides tha number of persons saved
from vessels of all kinds, there were six
ty-nine others rescued who had fallen
from wharves and piers or were other
wise in extreme peril, most of whom
would have perished but for the aid of
the llfe-savlntr crews.

Powell street after some delay Smith had
departed. ,,.,<
3 Smith admits writing the check,- but de
nies that he asked Crowther for $10.
"Why,, it was all, a Joke," Smith said.
I never thought he would try to use tho
check. No, no. I never asked him for
money. It was all a Joke."
Crowther is a dapper young fellow, who
feels his disgrace keenly and who is sin
gularly anxious to clear himself of some
of the reflections cast upon him by hid
erstwhile landlord. ; He euys he didn't
have a cheap room, but one of the best in
tho hotel; that he didn't open champagne,
eÂ« it coets too much in this country; that
bÂ« never posed as a young man of wealth,
and that he didn't contract debts beyond
hln ability to, pay had his remittances
from his uncle in Glasgow arrived.
Crowther was released last night on
the depositing of $150 cash bail. Attorney.
William J. Craig, who is representing
Crowther, said- the money was furnished
by one "Anderson," who did not care to
disclose his Identity. I
"He asked me suddenly," Crowther
Fays, "if I couldn't let him have 110 out
of- the change, as he had taken a notion
to do the line that night and was a little
short -Of ' money himself. ! Of course I
couldn't refuse him. I ought to have seen
his game, but I was worried and Â¦ that
mutual acquaintance talk had put me olf
my guard.
â¢'It was 6 o'clock by that time, and. I
went up to the Knickerbocker and had a
settlement with the landlord. Coming
downtown I met Smith by appointment nt
a Powell-street bar. He wanted to cash
Robinson's check there, but I objected
and eaid I would go down to the Palace
and get the money on it: .He said, 'You'll
not mind running back with $10 of it for
Â¦me," will. you?' Of course I wouldn't. I'd
have run a mile for a chap who had done

They went to the Palace arm In arm.
Smith disappeared long enough to write
the fictitious check for floo and returned.!
"Here is what'll pull you through," he
said heartily. "No, no, we don't want
any security, but you'll bo able to make
It good In two or three days, won't you?"

forthwith he had Detective Ross Whita

Smith says it was all a Joke; that he

Murder Without Provocation.
GeOrge Hayes of Seattle. was in Frank
lin last' night r on business. He says that
When the two men entered Hyde's saloon
one of them without tho slightest provo
cation shot the bartender through the
h^art. Then they lined up the customers
against the wall, making a thorough
search of each of them. From one man
they took $50. One who had no money was
beaten on the head, with revolvers.
Hyde, the proprietor of the saloon, was
playing cards in the back room at the
time. The robbers discovered him and
evidently knew him. They marched him
out behind the bar, and ordered him to
open the safe. Hyde had no alternative
but to comply, as two revolvers )were
pointed at his head. The thieves got
about $125 from the safe. They left by
the back way and made for their horses
near by.
Martin Johnson was very popular and It
may have been owtng to his fearless dis
position that he lost his life. He is said
by some to have refused to hold up his
hands when commanded to do so, while
others .who were In the saloon when the
robbery occurred say that the tall man
who tired did- not- give JohnsoA time 'to
obey tho command.
Two men wero found in Franklin who
â¢ay they saw two men ride up within a
hundred feet of the naloon nnd then-dle
mount. They w<;rc met by two other men,
who wore long rain coata. The four
walked rapidly to tho saloon und two
went In, while the others stayed outside.
At tho time nothing was thought of their
actions. The informants eay that this oc
curred at about 8:45 o'clock. It is learned
in Frunklin thut six rough characters left
Cumberland yesterday afternoon, bound
.for Franklin, and it la believed that the
murderers were of this party. Fifteen
Deputy Sheriffs are on the hunt, arid It
cannot be long before some trace of the
desperadoes la found.

The robbers wore masks made at blue
overalls. . They ran into the saloon and
covering the crowd with revolvers ordered

West Indies Expect Re
lief for Sugar Ex
portations.-
General Reyes Said to Have
No Desire for Pres-
Product . Now Coming > to
Americans May Go to
LONDON, March. 8.â It is learned that
the British Government intends in the
naar future to remove the half-penny per
pound duty which Is now imposed on
West Indian sugar.
This will afford the West Indies the
relief they have demanded until the Brus
sels convention comes into force. Between
now and September, 1903, according to
the terms of the convention, Great Britain
can take any steps she deems advisable
to safeguard the Industry.
The abatement of the sugar duties from
the West Indies Is tantamount to giving
it preferential treatment over all other
sugars, though, of course, it ceases the
moment the Brussels agreement becomes
operative. % ~ .. -
According to representatives of. the
leading sugar houses herb the immediate
effect will be to bring to English ports the
West Indian sugar which is now going to
American markets. A delegation, of lead
ing West Indians, Whom the Colonial
Office consulted this week on this matter,
declared that unless something of the
kind was done the West Indies would
be ruined before the new arrangement
could commence working.
MEXICO CITT, March 8.-Recent tele
grams from points on the American fron
tier to Journals of weight and prominence
In the United States deal with the impor
tant matter of the succession to toe
presidency of this republic In case of the
retirement of President Diaz, or at the
expiration of his present constitutional
period, and it was stated that he would in
such case be succeeded by the present
Minister of War, General Bernardo
Reyes. â¢
American papers have widely comment
ed on this dispatch, praising the Minister
of War as a valiant soldier and as Gov
ernor of the important State of Nuevo
lieon, where his administration gave sat
isfaction not only to the Mexican people,
but to resident Americans, and it was
properly argued that so capable an ad
ministrator would be certain tff' carry on
the wise policy of President Diaz, who
has created what is now generally called
"modern Mexico."
American editors also noted the fact of
sympathy existing between Â¦ Americans
and General Reyes, who, it was said,
would be certain to maintain the peace of
Mexico unaltered.
It is known, on unimpeachable author
ity, that General Reyes, in case of the
Presidential succession being open for tho
causes named, would give his cordial sup
port to the candidacy of Minister of Fi
nance Jose Ives Limantour, a statesman
of demonstrated aptitude for the highest
position in the Government and a strong
and able man.
People unacquainted | with Mexican af
fairs have sometimes regarded Senor Ll
mantour as being merely a financier,
which la an error, and It is believed ap
parently In the United States that only a
soldier can maintain the present most
satisfactory state of things in this coun
try. . Thus it has come about that the
American presa has spoken enthusiasti
cally of General Reyes as the successor of
President Diaz. But It Is known here that
General Reyes Is himself one- of the ele
ments of strength behind Minister Ltman
tour, as Reyes has clearly and publicly
on various occasions expressed himself.

T. P. Alexander, a civil engineer, who
had sport some time on the isthmus.' gave
information of a technical character to
the committee. He favored the Nicaragua
route.
He said that the company had paid the
Nicaraguan Government J^5,<wu for lands
along i he right-ot-way, it having 50,000
iicres in one tract. It still asserted the
right to this land and looked to the United
fctau:s for _ protection of its rights and
interests, lie said the company could not
cio anything without the assistance of the
United States. The Nicaraguan conces
t-ior.s had been canceled by the Nicara
guan Government and the company had !
protested the cancellation. There never i
had been any cancellation of the conces- j
fcions and franchises which the Maritime j
Company had obtained from Costa Rica, j
and these concessions were -exclusive. The |
canal could not be constructed or operated j
vithout -these concessions in Costa Rica. â¢
He was asked what would be the effect
if the United. States should acquire a con
cession 'from Costa Rica along the same
route and replied that it would be a vio- ;
lation'of the company's concessions, but]
added that the company, while asserting- j
its right to the concessions would not do j
fco' obstructively, go as to prevent the
United States from constructing the
canal. The spirit of the company was to
leave the matter to the United States
Government, believing that the Govern
ment would deal equitably with the com
pany, which had so long held the^e val
uable concessions and expended a great j
amount of money in work. He mentioned i
four or five million dollars as the value j
of th<> c!.iim? of the company.

Frightened Guests Rush From Hotel.
NEW YORK, March 8.â Several . hun
dred guests of the Hotel Endicott, in this
city, were thrown into a frenzy of excite
ment to-day by an alarm of. fire. Despite
assurances of the hotel employes that
there was no danger, the frightened peo
ple ran down the stairways, pushing and
shoving one another, â¢ and the two hotel
entrancesâ one on Eighty-first street and
the other on Eighty-second street, were
the scenes, of fearful crushes. The fire
itself was confined to a. window frame in
a dining-room on the fourth floor and did
little damage. No one was seriously hurt.
LIBRARY CORNERSTONE
IS AGAIN IN PLACE
Temporarily Shorn of the Inscription
Placed Upon. 1 It by San
Jose Elks. \
SAN JOSE. March 8.â The cornerstone
of the Carnegie Library, which ha3 been
the cause of strife between the Pastors'
Union on the one side and the local lodge
of Elks and the City Council on the other.
Is again in place. The laying of the stone
this, morning was. unceremonious. . none
being 'present but Contractor Curtis and
a few. stonemasons.
The stone. which has caused so much
trouble was innocent looking this* morn
ing, being deprived of its inscription.
Many believe tho affair is not yet ended,
for it is reported that when the building
is completed tho Inscription announcing
that tho. cornerstone was laid by the
Elks, at the request of the_ City Council,
will be replaced upon it.'
Since Contractor Curtis' toolhouse was
Invaded a few days ago and part of tha
Inscription cut from the stone the block
of granite has been In the hands of a
stone cutter. The entire inscription has
been removed, and in its place there has
been cut a panel about a quarter of ah
inch in depth.
As soon as Curtis and his men had the
stone in place they set some heavy planks
in front of it so that the public could
not see it.
It, Is understood that in the panel now
cut on the stone will be placed the in
scription stating that the stone was laid
by the Elks.

BY way of relieving, the strife over partisan measures and to establish a fellow-feeling of
mutual good will based upon harmony of thought and sentiment/ Congress is^just now
discussing quietly in committee-rooms and elsewhere the advisability of making it unani
â?r^ mous when the time comes to take up Senator Hoar's bill^ providing for an increase of
Congressional salaries. / . , . ... _
The bill provides for increasing . the pay of the Vice President and the Speaker of the
House from $8000 to $15,000 a year, and that of Senators and Representataives . from $5000 to
$7500. It -is estimated the effect of the 'raise, would be to take from the national treasury some
thing'like Si, 000,000 a year more than is now taken for salaries. That amount of money Vould
help to enliven Washington, improve trade and provide savings to be taken home to Buncombe
when the session is over.
The argument of course is the old one. Washington is becoming every year a more ex
pensive place to live in. The standard of social life is rising like the stock. of an industrial trust
on a Wall-street boom. Embassadbrs have given it a. full blown pride and' millionaires are mak
ing it a place for the maintenance of a magnificent social life. The day when a statesman could
live at a boarding-house for about Â§40 a month and be respected has long gone by.' It has van
ished like the oaths that.- Jackson swore and that manner of living is no more deemed polite.
Either the Congressman must let. himself be crowded out of the fashionable parts of the city, or
It will be perceived that the argument takes no heed of the taxpayer. No consideration is
given to the fact that he,. too, may be, living in an expensive city and has need for his coin. This
is an issue in which each Congressman feels that charity and justice alike begin at home. Neither
party, however, is quite willing, to make the raise on its own responsibility. An election is to
take place this fall, and the charge^pf salary grabbing is not a pleasant one to meet. That is the,
reason of the desire to make this bill unanimous. (-'Â¦: . .
Eastern rivers have been on an almost unprecedented rampage this spring, and it is said
those of Pennsylvania have "not been so high for forty years. The damage has, been immense,

The Loring Club's concert of Tuesday
evening next unfortunately conflicts with
the first FIsk : recital. But the Loring
Club is always sure of its audience, so
the club concert will probably not suffer.
Miss Grace I. Davis .will . be the soloist
of the evening, and interesting choral
numbers are programmed.
Mrs. Katharine Flsk's song recitals lead
the musical contralto of the week. The
distinguished contralto will appear in
four programmesâ on Tuesday and Fri
day evenings and Thursday and Saturday
afternoonsâ at Sherman & Clay Hall. It
Is long since any concert contralto of in
ternational fame has been heard here and
the occasion is therefore one of note.
Mrs. Fisk's programmes are admirable
and contain numbers representing, all
kinds of musical interest. It is pleasing
to note thereon a song by a clever young
Callfomian. E. A. Bruguiere, "The Gar
dener and the Rose," that will be sung at
the first concert. It also gives one pleas
ure to find another clever young Califor
nian as Mrs. Fisk's accompanist, Fred
Maurer, who follows thus in the footsteps
cf the RIchter, Colonne, Halle and other
orchestras that have accompanied the
singer. Quite worthily, too, I am sure.
Thev success of the Holmes testimonial
concert affords the sfneerest gratification
to all concerned and is a grateful indica
tion of the esteem in which the venerable
musician is held In the community, and
not less of the fine kindness of Mr.
Holmes' brother musicians. H. B. Pas

only the difficulty of choice among the
generous wealth of talent that was placed

kindly lent for the occasion, the ushers'
fcervices, printing, advertising, managing,
were all freely given, and the public also
generously responded. Some six or seven
hundred dollars was realized, I hear, and
the best of the affair was its complete
surprise for the recipient, who knew of
the concert only on the evening of its

Further statistics show that the increase of women in the ranks of industry in manufac
turing centers in Massachusetts did not diminish either the rate of marriage or of births, nor did
it increase the death rate. Industrial emancipation, then, must be relieved from the charge of
tending to break up the family. In fact it seems to promote marriage and the birth rate. Prob
ably if it were not for the industrial freedom of woman and her augmented chances of seff-sup
port family life in the United States would be in a far worse condition than it is.
MR. CARROLL D. WRIGHT in a recent address on the industrial emancipation
cf women expressed a belief that the increased : proportion of women engaged in re
munerative employment and self-supporting has been- the cause of a. decrease in the
marriage rate. The opinion is probably shared by a great majority of students of
sociology. A series of statistics cited by Horace G. Wadlin in an article on the subject contrib
uted to the Boston Globe seems to show, however, that while the marriage rate has decreased, the
cause of the decline is to be sought elsewhere than in industrial emancipation. In Massachusetts, at
any rate, the proportion of marriages is higher in the districts where abundant remunerative em
ployment is to be found for women than in districts where it is less abundant.
The decline in the marriage rate of the State as a whole has been such during the last
forty years that whereas in i860 of every 1000 women in the State 19.6 were married, in 1900 only
16.9 were married. Industrial development in Massachusetts therefore has been clearly accom
panied by a decrease of marriage, but Mr. Wadlin goes on to say: "Bearing in mind, however,
that the number of women married to each 1000 of the female population in the State at large
was 16.9 in 1900, we find the corresponding figures for Fall River, Lowell and Lawrence, all
cities in which large numbers of women are industrially employed, to be, respectively, 19.8, 21.2
and 20.4. In Holyoke the figure was 17.4; and in Boston, also where larjge numbers of women
find remunerative employment, the figure is 2r.1l The general rule seems to hold in Massachu
setts that the number of women married out of the entire female population is greatest in the in
dustrial cities and towns and lowest, in the places* where women have the least opportunity for em
ployment, and, of course, the least opportunity for coming into social contact with the op
posite sex."

"In Paris we are only Just now arriving.
It Is true we have christened a street
'Richard Wagner,' and that for the last
ten years "Tannhauser* has been the best
paying opera in Paris; but we have not
yet had 'Die Gotterdammerung* or 'Rhine
gold, at all, and Tristan and Isolde* only
by private enterprise."
M. Moreau was here not vainly but dis
creetly informed that we of San Francisco
could count a whole "Ring" to our name
a good year ago.
"We are frightfully slow in Paris, it is
remarkable, Leon Moreau is a person of
not in other ways, being one of the com
ing composers of France. He has writ
ten a pianoforte concerto that has made
its mark, and a symphonic poem for or
chestra, "Sur la Mer Lointalne," that is
now one of the favorite orchestral num
bers, both in France and England. Song
literature has also gained importantly by
M. Moreau's pen, as well as chorus pro
grammes and the lighter piano literature.
It is nattering to the American vanity
to hear M. Moreauâ with the right of long
and distinguished service to the cause â
diecuss the Wagnerian situation in Paris.
He is of the opinion that Wagner is best
taken when young, and In the largest pos
sible doses, that the patient by satiety
may come to know that there are other
f-.chools that deserve occasional attention.
."While you are in the mad-Wagner
Etage you can bear no other music," he
says. "It is even sufficient cause for a
duel to mention Bellini or Donizetti in" a
Wagner haunt! (And that Is where most
of Paris is just now.) But if you begin to
take him when quite young you have time
in an ordinary lifetime to come out on the
other side, and with all the rich expe
rience gained through study of the music
drama can appreciate the rest of the mu
sical kind.
Mme. Nevada's flutist, Daniel Maquarre,
has been another distinct pleasure of the
week. Elegant, pure and refined In style
and with a fluent technique, he represents
almost the best in his art, and with the
years may achieve the best. He has am
ple time, having but just reached his ma
jority.
M. Moreau Is the pianist of the com

school. While his pianlsm is by no means
Rarely, indeed, does the Spanish musi
cian invade the foreign concert platform
â so much the worse for the foreign con
cert platform If Mr. Casals at all repre
sents the artistic average of Spain. His
â¢work is extraordinary, and of the great
things that have been done here. He has
a style broad as music Itself, cosmopolitan
In the largest sense of the word, and with
out the faintest national ting.e /save, per
haps, a pervading nobility of accent that
may have been caught from the fading
splendors ef the once most splendid court
in Europe. He has a technique to match,
â¢unlabelcd by any school, and unimpeach
able, and a tone of infinitely varied beau
ty. And lastly, that nothing might be
â¢wanting to the rounding-off cf this un
usual talent, Mr. Casals possesses in
marked degree the personal spell, a mag
netism felt by the hardened concert-goer
and layman alike. My feet are usually
pretty fast to the floor at the average
concert, but, with many others to whom
the experience is a pleasurable novelty, I
xnust own to being carried off my small
3's last Monday night by the royal magic
cf Mr. Cabals' genius. He leads his au
<Jier.ce pretty much whither he will after
his first notes, as he sits, with shut eyes
and IlluTnined face, like some friendly wiz
xird, weaving his captivating web of mel
ody about them. Well, it is to make the
most of this latest Spanish invader while
he is here, for it is unlikely that there
will be another chance to hear him for
gome time to come. And when he does
come here again I doubt if the /larger
world will be so generously unacquainted
Â¦with his name as it now appears to be.
AFTER PABLO CASALS it will
enly be necessary to announce of
the infrequent Spanish artist that
he is a protege of the Queen of
Spain for him to receive a re-
Epectful, not to say worshipful, atten
tion from the musicians here. Mr. Ca
sals received his education at the gracious
hands of Queen Christine, who crowned
her kindness to the young artist by the
gift cf the lovely Guarnerius 'cello upon
which he plays. How well she has served
art in befriending the young 'cellist those
who have been fortunate enough to at
tend the Nevada concerts will attest, and
will further register a grateful vote to
3Â£me. Nevada for her excellent taste in
the choice of a company.

Such being the situation it may be taken for granted rlie Berlin report was unfounded. All
the same it is just as well that the question should be brought up, f or the Mpnroe, doctrine and
the determination of the American 'people "to; sustain it cannot be too frequently nor too firmly
enunciated. No Prince can induce us to waive the doctrine, nor could the Kaiser should he come
in person. As Senator Burrows said: "We are very glad to have Prince Henry come over to
visit us and we have given him a royal welcome, but if he expects to sneak in under, the Mon
roe tent we will see him when he crawls under the canvas." %
The promotion of German migration to South America by the imperial Government has
long since given rise to the belief that he. desires to establish German powei on this hemisphere,
and to that end would gladly procure a naval station where he could maintain a fleet strong
enough to protect German commerce in South America and to encourage German colonies.
Doubtless the Kaiser would be glad to have such a station, but a desire to obtain one and a definite
movement to accomplish the desire are 'two different things. Not even for the sake of his best
hopes of South American commerce and of South American colonies would he venture upon an
enterprise likely to bring him into conflict .with the United States.
' William C. Dreher, writing from Germany, furnishes to the March number of the Atlantic
Monthly an exhaustive review of sentiment in that country with respect to American problems.
In the course of his article he says: ."If any proof were needed of Germany's purpose to main
tain good relations with our country, her course in the Venezuelan matter has amply supplied it.
Indeed the fact that Germany came to an understanding with our Government before taking
forcible measures against Venezuela is of most momentous significance. Why? Because this is
the first explicit of the Monroe doctrine by any Continental power. It is a notable
milestone in the history of our country and its relations with European governments. It gives the
Monroe doctrine a validity no longer to be disputed. All this was instantly recognized by Ger
many. 'America for the Americans' said a great Berlin daily, 'has become an irreversible fact/ "
The report concerning the alleged mission of the Prince derives its importance mainly from
the fact that it came from Berlin and from the well-known eagerness of the Kaiser to establish
Germany as a world power with strength on every sea and in every quarter-of the globe. Neither
of those facts, however, nor both combined, suffice to give the report reliability. There is a jingo
element in the Berlin press that was eager to have the Kaiser settle his controversy with
Venezuela by the strong hand, and was much vexed when peaceful measures were resorted to
and the German fleet in the Caribbean Sea contented itself withi making a display of strength
instead of bombarding a Venezuelan port and annexing Venezuelan territory as a permanent sta
tion for German fleets and a German colony. It is natural that the jingoes thould see in the visit
of Henry a movement toward accomplishing their policy, and that they should even declare it to
be so. We must make allowance for that spirit and its exaggerations. Berlin may have wished
Prince Henry to have the alleged mission, but that is no proof that he has ever thought of such
a thing, or that the Kaiser has ever deemed it a question of practical politics.
DISPATCHES from Europe to the effect that the visit of Prince Henry to this country
was designed by the Emperor as a means of obtaining a. fortified naval station and
base of supplies in this hemisphere have been promptly met by statements of officials in
Washington that if the Prince came with any such purpose his mission would be futile.
There has been no evasion of the issue. . Republican and Democratic Senators are unanimous
on that point, and Senator Elkins expressed the whole matter clearly in saying: 'The American
people will not sanction anything of the kind. We are always, willing to receive foreign visitors
cordially and give them hospitable greeting, but we are staid when it comes ' to giving up oui
rights and advantages 'under the Monroe doctrine."

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
I, almost crossed-my-heart-to-dle that I

pealing blue eyes of the young lady but
a stern duty to my paper, forbade' and
here, with humble apologies to her is the
secret. There is a fairy godmother in the
case, two of them, in fact. They stand in
the wings, and as soon as Miss Mudse
leaves the stage they wave their wands
and the air is full of flying garments
Coats fly off and gowns fly on faster than
eye can see. A cap drops from nowhere
and perches itself on the Mudge curls
thoes attach themselves to the Mudge
feet seemingly of their own accord and
presto! prestissimo! there you are' Noth
Of course there is a mystery, and little
Miss Mudge besought me not to give Â«t
away, for she said quaintly.
"If people know how it is done, why It
will not be a wonder any more."
But, nevertheless, Miss Mudge Is a very
charming little person, and her turn Is
the cleverest of its kind that has come
within my ken. She sings, in a quite un
trained, but pleasing contralto voice, a
patriotic ditty, illustrated by four com
plete changes of costume. It is the light
ning-like rapidity of the changes that con
stitutes the chief wonder of the turn, and
that has given rise to the rumor that Miss
Mudge is twins. She comes out first in
a dapper soldier suit, a scant five feet of
plump and pleasing femininity, with a
bright, boyish face, and ' the clearest,
roundest, bluest eyes Imaginable. After
her sons, a dignified sort of affair, the
soldier boy bows his leisurely way
through a door at the back of the stage,
and, hey presto! in four seconds a comely
Red Cross Nurse, in irreproachable get
up, appears. Four seconds has sufficed
to shed the complete soldier outfit and
put on the gray gown, white apron, white
fichu and white cap of the Red Cross
maid. Then the nurse warbles a verse or
two and disappears, and four seconds
later a bonnie^- sailor laddie with the
pretty Mudge .â¢ face, wanders on the
stage, with his hands in his pockets and
the air of having eons of time at his dis
posal. Then comes some more patriotism,
until Miss Mudge begins to hanker for
more new clothes, and the sailor, boy
swaggers out, to give way ten seconds
later to Stonewall Jackson, in the lull
splendors of the Confederate/ uniform.
Jackson takes care of the concluding
stanzas of the patriotic cycle and then
departs In his turn. The last change, to
a dainty soubrette, French-heeled and
glitter-gowned, bejeweled and elaborately
coiffured, is made almost before one can
say ''Jack Robinson" or"the orchestra
switch round to the pretty little coon song
with which Miss Mudge closes her in
genious performance. -
O Eve, why art thou "Mudge!"
I dreamed thee "Vere de Vere";
I dreamed a humor dear.
When "Mudge" fell on ray eas.
But thus doth fate begrudge
The scanty lausrhter here.
0 Eve, why art thou "Mudge?"
I dreamed thee "Vere de Vere'."
1 thought (O hasty judge!)
An attic jester near â ; Â¦
The female wit â all fudge?
Well, you are right. I fear.
O Eve, why art thou "Mudge?"
I dreamed thee "Vere de Vere!"
THE burnins Question of the week
in upper dramatic circles has been
whether or not Eva Mudge, the
"lightning change artist" at the
Orpheum, is twinsâ the grammar
of this sounds doubtful, but as I happen
to know that she isn't twins I can hardly
be expected to subscribe to a syntax that
would imply Miss Sludge's plural exis
tence. Her soft, smudgy little name in
terested me in Miss Eva long 1 before I
had seen her Ingenious "turn." I won
dered where she got it, what odd freaE
of feminine humor had led to Its choice,
for it is vastly unlike the "Fleurettes"
and /"Montmorencys" that blossom so
freely in the vaudeville garden. I was
almost disappointed to find that she comes
by it honestly, that the humorists were
the good Mudges, her parents, and that
their only daughter has her quaint little
narhe by the prosaic right of inheritance.
In my disappointmentl even dropped into
rhyme, for which, under the dire provoca
tion, I hope to be forgiven:
But the godmothers are off duty oft the
stage. At her ordinary dressing Miss
Mudge loiters and fusses and dwadle*
just like the average girl. She is mucn
rr-ore like the average girl in everything,
by the way, than the usual vaudevillain.
Her father. and mother travel with her
wherever she does, and it is a case of in
dulging an only child iri the vaudeville'
whim, as other only children are indulge!
In ether hobbles. She has been on the
stage since she was five years old â not so
very long 'ago â in dancing turns. In the
"legitimate," In everything except grati'I
opera, and hopes some day to be a comic
cpera star. All thi3 with the face and
Â¦ways of a sweet, wholesome little school
girl. She is ever so clever and ,j>artlcri
larly nice.

three months prior to his departure for
the north he drove an omnibus for the
State House Hotel. Several months ago
he married a young woman residing in
Woodland, but her maiden name could
not be ascertained here to-day. "
Who "Jack" is none of. the trio would
admit knowing. Lorenger says he. was
mad with jealousy, but refuses to\ say
who. caused it. Neither will Mrs. Lo
renger talk of whatever, troubles may
have 'preceded the sensational climax to
to-day. Both husband and wife are about
22 years of age, . . â¢
Then the shooting began. Emma Hart
man, a woman companion, was with Mrs.
Lorenger, but if she knew any cause for
Lorenger .being Jealous she guarded the
secret. At the hospital Mrs. Lorenger
asked: "Does Jack know?"
"N,o, I am going to-day," she said
The couple have been here, about a
month, having come to the city direct
from the California capital. For some
days past the wife has insisted upon re
turning to her home, but her husband has
refused to permit her departure. In his
absence yesterday she removed her be
longings from, the apartments occupied
by them, and was buying a ticket at the
depot when Lorenger approached. He
had discovered his wife's ruse and rushed
immediately; to the depot. In impassioned
eagerness he asked her to wait until the
day following, when he would return with
her. Mrs. Lorenger refused; a policeman
warned him ' away and it was. believed
Lorenger started to leave, but he edged
around until he again reached the side of
his wife.
"Won't you wait for me, dear?" he
asked. .
When Lorenger saw his wife fall he
thought he had killed her, and placed the
smoking weapon to his own head. Before
he could pull the trigger a policeman
grasped the hand holding the revolver and
the man was disarmed. Mrs. Lorenger
was taken to a hospital, where it was
found that her -wound was more painful
than serious. Lorenger was locked up. .

CHICAGO, March S.â A special meeting
of the mileage bureau committee of the
Western Passenger Association will be
held here next Thursday to consider the
proposition to Increase the mileage or in
terchangeable tickets from 2000 miles to
3000 miles, and also to restrict the use of
2000 mile individual mileage books to the
lines issuing them. This is to prevent in
dividual roads from issuing interchange
able mileage. The avowed object of rais
ing the interchangeable mileage is to pre
vent the goneral public from using these
books and conllno them, solely to large
wholesale merchants and Jobbers.

Said a Missouri planter: "The negro
seems to have a natural talent in the
matter of picking cotton. He can beat
the world. I have been watching the
negro for a great many years, having
spent my life on a cotton plantation in
Mississippi, in an effort to find the ele
ments which give him superiority in this
respect, but I have .not been able to
formulate any correct theory with re
gard to the matter. Certainly there is
nothing in the structural nature of the
negro that would tend to give him any
great advantage over the white man as
a cotton picker. I have seen white men
of the same size and build, having ap
proximately the same arm reach and tho
bame measurements generally, pick cot
ton, row for row, -witn the negro, and at
weighing time in the evening the negro
would have from 250 to 350 pounds while
the white man would have probably less
than 150 pounds. They would pick the
same number of rows of cotton, but the
negro, on account of his superior skill,
would keep ahead, and he would cull the
row nest to his, and in this way would
cram into his sack probably one-fourth
of the cotton on the white man's row.
Cotton picked by a negro is not as free
from trash as the cotton picked by a
white hand, but the quantity of the trash
in cotton picked by the better class of
negroes does not in any way injure the
staple unless the season is nearing tho
close and the bolls begin to rot. The
negro seems to have a better use of his
arms and ringers, and gets quicker ac
tion in picking cotton. And then there
is the fact- that the negro sings nearly
all the time he is picking cotton, a low,
musical sort of hum, which apparently
aids him a great deal by closing his con
sciousness to all else around him except
the cotton bolls, and I expect this has a
great deal to do with the fact that he
picks more cotton in a given space of
time than the white man."â New Orleans

Greyhounds are the swiftest of all four
footed creatures, and their speed may be
regarded as equal to that of carrier pis
eons. English greyhounds, which are
carefully selected and which are used for
coursing, are able to cover at full gallop
a space between eighteen and twenty
three yards every second.â Our Dumb
Animals.
According to M. Dusolier the speed of
the shepherd dogs and those used in hunt
ing ranges from ten to fifteen yards a
second. English setters and pointers hunc
at the rate of eighteen to nineteen miles
an hour, and they can maintain this speed
for at least two hours.
Foxhounds are extraordinarily swift, as
is proved by the fact that a dog of this
breed once beat a thoroughbred horse,
covering four miles ln six and one-half
minutes, which was at the rate of nearly
eighteen yards a second.
Thus the wolf can run between fifty and
sixty miles ln one night, and an Arctic
fox can do quite as well, if not better.
Nansen met one of these foxes on tho
Ice at a point more than seventy miles
northwest of the Sannlkow territory,
which is 430 miles from the Asiatic coast.
Eskimo and Siberian dogs can travel for
ty-five miles on the ice ln five hours, and
there is one case on record in which a
team of Eskimo dogs traveled six and
one-half miles in twenty-eight minutes.
After pointing out the marvelous endur
ance shown by little fox terriers, who fol
low their masters patiently for hours
while the latter are riding on bicycles or
in carriages, he says that even greater
endurance is shown by certain wild ani
mals that are akin to dogs.
Some remarkable statistics in regard ta
what remarkable speed dogs are capable
of have been gathered by M. Dusoller. a
French scientist.

The general then declared the Filipinos
could not be classed with the Cubans and
he said that if the United States troops
should now leave the Philippine Islands
there could be half a dozen different kinds
of civil war , there and that the world
would hold the United States responsible.
The general said he talked with Aguinaldo
on their way back to Manila from the
Vicksburg and that Aguinaldo told him
that neither Dewcy nor any one else had
promised him anything, but that he and
his people had faith in the Americans.
General Funston called on Prince Henry
in the afternoon at the Prince's apart
ments and the two chatted for almost an
hour.
"There are many men in the United
States who did more with their mouths
and minds to aid the insurgents than did
these poor men with the Krag-Jorgenson
rifles. I would rather see those men
hanged for treason than to see one of- our
soldiers dead on the field of battle."
The general said there was not one of
the so-called Filipino patriots who could
not be convicted of murder if he was
tried by a Jury. He declared that there
had never been a war in the world's his
tory where the soldiers had shown such
humanity as had tho American troops in
the Philippine islands. He then told of
six American soldiers who had Joined the
Filipinos and were afterward captured
and executed as traitors, and then said:
General Funston then gave many exam
ples to show that the- Filipino leaders
were not true patriots. He mentioned the
slaying of Antonio I.una, who was or
dered slain by Aguinaldo. General Fun
stor. said that Aguinaldo had told him 11:
regard to Luna's e'eath: "I had him
killed simply because he would have been
dictator Instead of myself."
Filipinos a Bad Lot.
"All of those men who have fallen since
December, 1900," he continued, "have been
victims of a lot of misinformed and mis
guided people here ln the United States.
It is perfectly proper for us to have all
sorts of opinions as to what we should do
with the Philippine islands, but for
heaven's sake let us keep them to our
selves until every square inch of that ter
ritory recognizes the sovereignty of the
United States."
General Funston then mentioned eev
eral instances of personal bravery of men
ln tho army which resulted ln their
deaths, including thoso of Captain God
frey and Sergeant O'ttrlcn. Jin was
present when Sergeant O'Brien was ntiot
and said: "it was one of those wild mo
menta that are worth ten years of hum
drum existence." His listeners cheered
tho remark.
"All sorts of men get into the army.
There are good, bad and indifferent, but
I believe that Â£15 per cent of tho American
soldiers aro a bruvo and humane lot of
men. Tho other u per cent, who have been
writing letters to newspapers, have or
namented tho insldo of a gmg house
longer thun they havo distinguished
themselves in tho Held."
"The dance has begun."
"What dance?" I asked, and Major Met
calf replied " 'Go out and hear it,' und
I went out and heard the pattering of
rifle balls, and that was the beginning of
tho war over there."
General Funston then told in minute de
tail of the instances which led to the war
fare between the American army and the
insurgents, and during the narrative told
of the shooting of several' sentries by
Filipino scouts who had passed the lines.
He said that m the opening of the battle
between the army and the insurgents
Major Metcalf of the First Kansas Regi
ment had come to his quarters and said:
How the War Began.
"The army has been doing . as much
good as it could under the circumstances.
When Manila was surrendered to Dewcy
and Merritt some thousands oÂ£ Spaniards
were in the city. In the eyes of the world
these people looked to us for protection,
and to have turne'd them over to the un
controllable mob known as Aguinaldo's
army would have, been tho blackest page
of American history, one that a thousand
years of repentance and restitution would
not have satisfied."
"To talk about the war in the Philip
pines, is not an agreeable subject, but
what I may say may aid some of you in
forming opinions as to the condition of
affairs in the islands.

From France, where the first woman

with wonder,- comes a chivalric refuta
tion of the idea that .as the intellectual
woman continues to come in the kiss is
to go out." "We may reassure ourselves."
writes :M.- Marcel Prevost. "There are
yet bright days in store for this strange
yet charming gesture."
- We need not pause to inquire why M.
Prevost calls the kiss a "gesture." So
long eg he permits us ; to rejoice in hia
confidence that our women .doctors are
not to . prescribe away the old tender
symbol of devotion, or our women law
yers to express love in a brief Instead of
a caress, we have no becoming criticism
to offer on his choice of . words.

It is noted, moreover, that Democrats
or the war horse kind are very close to
the Gage administration. It is an open
question whether the last Harbor Com
n:!ssit>ner appointed by Gago is not more
of a Democrat than a Republican. In
J. mill's blue book ho Is rated as a Demo
crat. There is no doubt, hotvever, about
the political soundness of Thomas Kirk
patrick of thÂ« Republican State Central
Committee, llln fealty to the party lw
vouched for by Dan T. Cole, who JÂ« serv
ine hi* couptry in tho Mint. ThÂ» oppor
tunity {h, therefore, pronented to Qnno of
having on the board one Klrkpntrlck of
undoubted Republican proclivities.
From aU accounts it appears that the
Governor does not intend to make special
hc;pte in the selection of Herold's Bucces
sor. Patronage expected is alluring to
many political workers, but patronage
distributed possesses a charm for only
one of the many.
Among tho aspirants are Thomas Kirk
patrick, member of the executive branch
of the Republican State Central Commit
tee; C. H. S. Pratt, Pilot Commissioner;
Frank Marston, a prominent Native Son;
State Senator Jack Tyrrell, and Sig Bett
man. As Herold is a Democrat the Gov
ernor encounters strong pressure in favor
of immediate selection of a. Republican
Commissioner. The hard work of listening
to everything said for and against the ap
plicants does not now wholly devolve upon
Daniel Kevane. The new Adjutant Gen
eral, George Stone, chairman of the Re
publican State Central Committee, is ae
cessible to the expectant. During the
strenuous times of the long Senatorial
contest supporters of Burns were held
together by promises of patronage on the
water front. Many, if not nearly all of
these promises, remain unredeemed. Tho
clamorous seekers for a eign of redemp.
tion have been told time and again that
the Governor and the "colonel" could do
nothing as long as the Democrats had a
voice in controlling appointments. When
Colonel Kirkpatrick, manager of the Pal.
ace Hotel, was appointed to succeed Ma>
Jor Hamey the army of the promised
hoped that daylight would break, but the
push -was cast back into utter darkness
by the unwelcome news that Commis
sioners Kilburn and Herold had nailed
everything in sight for months ahead.
The same old story will probably be told
by the new Commissioner, whoever, he
may be. Now a new crop of. assurances
wlli soon ripen and promises will be as
thick on a water front job as autumn
leaves in Vallambrossa. ; ,' Â¦'
The number of aspirants to succeed
Rudolph Herold on the Board of State
Harbor Commissioners is legion. Her
old's term of four years will expire next

GIVE DBAMATIC RECITAL
It is now practically admitted that the
iiev.s that Seymour passed through Seat
tle yesterday on his way to Vancouver is
ttnrcaliable. Seymour did not take a
north-bound train and unless he boarded
the overland gimply us a ruse to throw
people off his track, it is quite certain
that he is now several hundred miles east
of here.
It has been persistently argued by those
lUereEted In the solution of the mystery
surrounding the young prirl's death that
the copy of the Denver Post, which was
found in the room where the body was
discovered, would prove an important
clew if prcperly run down. It was a
paper that arrived in this city three days
cfter Kora Fuller disappeared. The copy
of the paper was received by a local rail
road man and subsequently turned over
to a member of the United Brotherhood of
Railway Employes, who was attending
the convention of that body, which was
in pession at the time of Xara Fuller's
disappearance. As there have been mys
terious strangling cases, similar to the
Xora Fuller case, in Denver, it Is more
than likely that the police have received
some clew which necessitated Seymour
poing- to Denver or thereabouts. '
Â¦ Much concern is felt in police circles
ever Seymour's whereabouts. Chief Witt
nian is remaining in close touch with his
office from early morning to late at night
in the expectation of receiving some word
from the Chief of Detectives, He re
mained at police headquarters until close
lo miCr.ighi last night, but no message
came from Seymour.
When he; left the city last Wednesday
mcrnir.g Seymour took the 7:30 boat
neroEs the bay and on arriving at the
rcole he was jseen to take the Atlantic
express. John A. Hammersmith, the
prominent Jeweler, and "several others
saw the Chief of Detectives boarding the
train. He carried a small* hand valise,
which was only big enough to hold the
few articles absolutely needed on a hur
ried trip. I*;
The indentions nre that Chlrf of De
tectives John Seymour 1* in Denver or
thereabout In search of Nora Fuller's
murderer or investigating a clew to his
Identity or whereabouts. While Chief of
Police Wlttnuj.ii retains an absolute si
lence on the whereabouts of Seymour, fe
j'using to deny or affirm rumonÂ« as to his
route, there are several good reasons for
ihi advanced belief that Seymour has

WHO'S WHO IN AMERICA

Ever since Uncle Sam's postofflce be
gan making stamps, In 1847, or there
abouts, the | face ' of Washington has ap
peared ;on.-.one ; 'of the stamp's In , every,
regular Issue, and with a single excep
tion on a stamp of low value and general
use. ; Benjamin Franklin's face has al
ways' adorned postage stamps of low
value, and has thus become familiar to
people who send or receive letters ever
since 1S47.
As the regular series oi stamps', exclud
ing Â¦ the -Columbian,- Trans-Mississippi,
and. Pan-American exposition. Issues, haa
now been in circulation with ouly slight
changes In watermarks and. the like since
1890, a change of some, sort is expected
soon, by philatelists.
If President McKlnley's portrait 'is put
on one of the' postage . stamps of this
country, as dispatches from Washington
have said Is likely to be done In case the
Postofllce Department brings out a new
issue, his- portrait will be the ninth of a
President, to be used in that way.

Common sense would suggest that if one

result from the food we eat and dtgest. and
that food should be albuminous or flesh-form-

are the foods which form the greater part of

Providence is sometimes credited with
directing the footsteps by so simple a way
as the reading: of a food advertisement.
A lady out in Shelbina, Mo., says:
"About, two years ago I was compelled to

"I Buffered agony in my back. My
hands and feet would uwell tip nights. I
was in a dreadfully nervous condition, Ir-

digest anytbins if I tried. I was unable
to remember what I read and was, of
course, unfit for my work.
"Some field I had consumption, others

looked upon with Â¦, wonder by a> society
which regards the person of a Hohenzol
lern as something almpst sacred. It can
not be here how v the Prince
could shake hands with unknown and ob
scure persons.' The incident of the Gov
ernor of Minnesota tapping Prlnc* Henry
on the shoulder and speaking familiarly
to him is related, with absolute amaze
ment. Yet there is hot, the least criti
cism of American manners, such # things
being treated â¢; as - quite proper under a

Summing up the results of the journey,
not one of the papers assumes that it will
have great political consequences, but
nearly all of them agree that it will
cause a permanent and more. kindly feel-
Ing between .the two peoples, which is
precisely the result that could, do the
most good.
Some of the old Journalistic enemies of
the United States flnd.it difficult to re
strain themselves. amid this festive period.
The Kreuz Zeitung grants that the dem
onstrations are immense and that Ameri
cans never do anything in 'a small way,
but, the paper adds, "everything runs Into
the gigantic. Nothing more is really de
manded. Caring nothing for the Intrinsic
character of the achievements, the only
requisite is .to strike the eye and make an
imposing appearance. No deeper exam
ination is made." The editor thinks this
Is "due "to the democratic conditions,
where the crowd decides and transient
moods control politics."
Prince Henry's home-coming Is begin
ning to be anticipated. He will disem
bark at Cuxhaven, where, it is said, Em
peror WUliam will welcome him. The
Ulk cartoons the return of the Prince's
party, showing them leaving a train in a
dilapidated condition. Admiral von Tir
pitz yawning with fatigue- and General
von Plessen supported by a servant, who
calls for a doctor, saying, "Just back
from America." Lackeys are also shown
carrying bales labeled "Addresses." The
hospitality of the Americans to the crew
of the Hohenzollern Is referred to. as be
ing like that of a promised land, where,
If milk and honey do not- flow, there Is
wine and beer In plenty and everything
free when the men go ashore to a ball or
a theater, the .elevated roads, electric
cars and ferries all costing them nothing,
and it is further said that free beer is

Yes. It . may hurt the agricultural interest.
or what Is left of It, In England, but I do not
believe that this demonstration will be as
serious as the evils which the change will
correct. Not only Is it interesting to note the
Influence of the American system In these
sweeping changes, but tkey will have a tre
mendous negative importance. Last year the
Government dearly Indicated Us fears that It
might have to resort to conscription.
The present move banishes all possibility of
this, . for I understand Mr. . Brodrick Is willing
to go even further in copying the United
States' excellent treatment of enlisted men and
by liberal finance build up the standard of the
army. The Increase in pay means an addi
tional annual cost of about Â£2.000,000. but I
maintain Â¦ that It will be a direct saving of
money. Â¦ for â¢ the better class of - men secured
will mean ' fewer . men In the hospitals and
prisons, - as : well â¢ as obviating other forms of
wastage,, and will quickly make' up for the
additional Initial outlay. Some day, perhaps,
we may be able to adopt the sensible plan of
the United States of paying the enlisted men
of all arms atv the same rate. But traditions
here die hard. '
A year ago Mr. Brodrick pooh-poohed the
Idea of copying from the United States. Now he
has changed his mind and has done what the
majority of the members, of the House, re
gardless of party, believe to be the very best
thing that could have happened to the army
since Mr. Cardwell (in 1872) Â«ffected his
sweeping reforms. For the first time "Tom
my," with everytbingr "found" and higher
pay, will be In a better position than bis agri
cultural brother, and from that class we ought
now to get the best Instead or the worst.
Under the old pay we were gradually lower-
Ing the physical standard, yet still Uncling It
hard to get men, while our dese/tion percent
age was increasong at a rate which showed
there was something radically wrong- with
the system. The American array 'was the only
other volunteer enlisted boay In. the world
with which we could make' serviceable com
parisons, the Continental armies, owing to
conscription and other causes, being perfect
ly worthless as examples.
At last we have taken out a leaf from your
excellent book, though I do not believe we
have gone quite so far In that direction as we
might, or hope we may. Under Mr. Brod
rick's proposed changes, a private In the Brit
ish infantry now receives almost as much aa
a private in the United States army. With
this change, which I frequently advocated
while ' military attache at Washington, we
hope to get a class of recruits similar to those
secured In America.

the -weather was ideal for golf. The two
amateurs, C. E. Maud and Walter Fair

amateur championship of the - Pacific
Coast, were well, up with the profession
als at the finish, being fourth and fifth,
respectively. .' Not wishing to sacrifice
their amateur standing, they forfeited
fourth and fifth moneys to the next near

fourth ' money was given to David Bell,
with ' a score of 337, while fifth money was
divided between A- S. Baxter and H. M.

made almost entirely of laurel and was

dinner Prince Henry retired to his apart

And what has become of the goading and
nagging attempts to stir up 111 feeling here and
there, ascribing to the German ' Government
designs to intrude as a 'land grabber Into the
American sphere and attributing to us here a
ruffianly Itching to see In conflict the new war
fleets of the two countries â as if such a com
bat were . only a football game between col
lege students, i Has not every sensible person
long ago dismissed these goadings as puerile
twaddle? Likewise the well-worn legend of a
threatening antl- American coalition of ' the
Continental powers of Europe at the begin
ning of our Spanish wax â a coalition said to
have been under the leadership, | or at least
participated In by Germany, from which dan
ger some mysterious Providence had to save
us â has recently died a somewhat inglorious
death. â¢ Â¦,-..Â¦
The* speaker reviewed what German
born citizens had done for the Union dur
ing the Civil- War, referred to the sympa
thy of Prussia with the Union cause,
spoke of the present friendly, relations of
Germany and the United States, and con
tinued:
Carl Schurz was the next speaker and
his address was loudly applauded. He
eald in part:
I shall not tire you with long historical dis
quisitions, although to what in these days has
often been said, many fair words might be
added about the lively sympathy with which
Frederick the Great and with him all thinking
Germans greeted the American .war of inde
pendence and the entrance of the American re
public in the family of nations â in one word,
about the historic fact that the birth of the
German-American friendship was contemporary
with the birth of the United States and that
it could not therefore be possibly older than
It is. I would rather confine myself to that
period of our history of which I have myself
been a living witness.
The Prince was then presented to the
diners. He wore the dress uniform of a
German admiral and spoke in German.
His address was very brief. He said the
reception he received to-night was a new
and additional proof of the friendliness
and enthusiasm with which he had been
received and regarded in every quarter of
the United States he had visited. He ex
pressed his deep appreciation of the dem
onstrations of friendliness and kind feel
ing. He declared that he thought the
German society would do much toward
extending and improving the kindly senti
ment.
At the conclusion of his speech Schwab
turned and presented to Prince Henry a
beautiful album on behalf of the city. He
then proposed the health of the Prince
and called for a "long may he ' live,"
which was responded to' with great
warmth.
Gift to the Prince.
The visit of your Royal Highness Is now ap
proaching Its end. You have left a lasting
Impression among all the people with whom
you have come In contact, through your
friendly sympathy and your kindly greeting.
We venture to express the hope that you will
retain an agreeable Impression of your short
presence among us Americans, and I therefore
request permission to. present you on behalf
of the German Society of the city of New York
with this album, which we hope will contrib
ute, to ward keeping alive the memories of the
few days that you have Epent in the United
States. The German Society of . the city of
New York wishes. your Royal Highness a long
and happy life and a happy- return to your
dear ones.
Our society celebrates this evening the 118th
year of Its existence. It wad founded In the
flrat year of the political independence of our
country. Its flnst president was General von
Steuben, the friend and adviser of Washlnsr
ton and one of the great actors In the Revo
lutionary War. Ha was followed as president
by men of high standing and reputation, whose
names are Identical with the history of our
city. I refer to such names as William WIN
merdlngr, Jacob I^orlllard, Philip Hone, John
Jacob â¢ Astor, Fblllp Blsslnger and Charles
Hauselt. ,
When our nation was * still weak, and the
population of the city was still small the Ger
man society took part In the year 1704, as a
body, In the erection of fortifications on Gov
ernors Island for protection against external
enemies, f or Â¦ at that time a new war with
KiiKinnd was threatened. In the minutes of the
noclety we find an ,*ntry of that year accord-
Ing to which all members of tho society, with
their president at the head, and with muslo
and flags Hying, marched down Broadway to
Whitehall, where they took a vessel for Gov
ernors Island and there worked "during the
day under the direction of the engineers and
of the Mayor of the city In the erection of
earthworks. During . our Civil War the Cter
man Â¦ society ehowed its patriotic sympathy
through the collection of money and provis
ions for the sick and wounded soldiers of our
armies.

health of the President of the United

then proposed the health of the German
Emperor, which called forth three lusty

A CAUSE OrHEADACflE!
One Very Common Cause, Generally
. ' \' Â¦ Overlooked.
Headache is a symptom, an indication ot de-
rangement or disease In some organ, and the
cause of the headache Is difficult tq locate be-
cause bo many diseases have headache as a
prominent symptom : . derangement ' of the
stomach and liver, heart trouble, kidney j dis-
ease, . lung trouble, eye strain or . 111-flttlng
glasses air produce headaches, and If yro could
always locate, the organ which is at fault the
cure of obstinate headachea would be a much
simpler matter. ! " ., ,
However, for that . form . of headache called
frontal headache, pain back of the eyes and In
forehead, the cause Is now known to be catarrh
of the head and throat; when the headache Is
located In back ot head and neck It. is often
caused from catarrh of the stomach or liver."
At any rate catarrh la the most common
cause of such headachea and the cure of the
catarrh causes a prompt ; disappearance of the
headaches. : Â¦'
- There Is at present no treatment for catarrh
so convenient and effective as Stuart's. Catarrh

Bert Schlesinger of Denson & Sehlesin
ger, special counsel for the Government,
replied at length, cittcg authorities to
show that the position ta^en by Mr. Col
lins was untenable and impossible. The
matter was then submitted and will be
decided at an early date by - Judge de
Haven.
Objection was made to the third count
because, as Mr. Collins claimed, it al
leged embezzlement, but did not allege
tliat the defendant, Walter N. Dimmick,
committed the crime.
The objection against the second count
was that Dimmick was accused of hav
ing taken and used the money "as clerk."
He. had a right to take and use it "as
clerk," the words meaning that he had
authority so to use It Hence, argued
the ingenious attorney, the allegation in
the same count charging Dimmick with
embezzlement is repugnant to the alle
gation that he used the money in his ca
pacity as clerk and by authority of such
office. â¢
He argued that the words "then and
there" should be repeated in each count,
otherwise it might be assumed that the
acts charged were alleged to have been
committed at the time of the finding of
the indictment. The next point raised
was with reference to -the manner in
which the amount is mentioned, being
"1500 double eagles or 20-dollar pieces."
Mr. Collins contended that the words
could be taken to mean "1500 double eagles
or 20 cne-dollar pieces." To be explicit
the sum should have been stated to be
"1500 double eagles or 1500 twenty-dollar
pieces" he argued.
The Dimmick case came up again
before United States District Judge de
Haycn yesterday, this time on demurrer
to the Indictment charging Walter N.
Dimmick with the theft and embezzle
ment of $30,000 from the United States
Mint. George D. Collins, attorney for
the defendant, made a fine-spun argu
ment on the pointj relied upon to wipe
out the indictment.

nRS. JAMES LEWIS BOARD of
Port Huron, Mich., and New
York City, at present at the
Palace Hotel, has just issued an
order for books to the extent of
$50,000, to be placed in the handsome
library of her Michigan summer home.
Mr. and Mrs. Board spend a great deal of
their time in travel, but they especially
seem to like their home in Port Huron
and spare no expense in adding to its
magnificence. .
The new library is the latest acquisi
tion and when completed Will be the
pride of the Wolverine State., The pres
ent library of the family is already the
finest in the State of Michigan, but it is
destined to become the best in the world
before many months have elapsed. The
very rare collection of books is now con
tained in the Board mansion, but a new
building is being erected on the grounds
in which the volumes will be separately
placed. The new library building is a cir
cular-shaped fireproof structure in Kiosk
style of architecture, the decorations of
which are the most original and artistic
that the masters of to-day can produce.

In addition to being a literary enthusi
ast, Mrs. Board is most hospitable and a
charming entertainer. She has only re
cently-come to Â¦ San .'Francisco to escape
the cold weather, but. â¢ has 'â¢; entertained
most lavishly in Chicago, New. York, and
at her summer home in Port Huron,
Michigan, where she' is loved as much as
she is admired. ;>..-. , -
Mrs. Board is the wife "of a mil
lionaire, formerly of the G. A. Cros
by Company, Chicago, who indulges
his wife's artistic tastes in every
possible way. It is as unusual as it ia
gratifying to find a woman so young and
beautiful as is Mrs. Board thinking seri
ously of the benefits to be derived by the
study, of the fine arts, and she sets an en
viable example for the women of America
and Europe.
Indulges Wife's Tastes.
Among the choice books is a set of Kip
ling autographed by Mr. Kipling and
bound in raw Japanese silk. The new
order will. add many valued works to the
lot. One set or Gautier alone is valued
at $4500. The Waverley novels are bound
in full double levant, hand-tooled by
Lowndes in London, costing $1630. . The
edition of Schiller and Goetbe, of which
ten cNopies were limited to America, is se
lected by Mrs. Board, whose twenty-four
volumes represent $3500. A set of Napo
leon, Bourlesne's production, costs $50 per
volume.- The finest edition of Ruskin's
writings is to cost $1000. Burton's "Ara

sents ?2000. The Edinburgh edition of
Robert Louis Stevenson is of great value.
Five hundred dollars is being expended
upon a set of Tennyson's poems. A very
fine edition of Muhlbach Is among the
prized copies of the master works, as well
as a beautiful and costly set of the writ
ings of George Eliot. In a few months
the new Kiosk library building' will be
completed and at that time the $50,000

When the settlement of these lockouts and
strikes was brought about last October, no set
tlt-ment could be made for Bottlers' Union 102
because the latter. In violation of all trades
union rules at^d practices, had in the past kept
a reserve force of bottlers whom it did not ai
low to join the union, but who were given
employment through the union otflee when work
waa busy and laid off when it became slack,
or a union bottler wanted the place of one of
these reserves. Because the national union
and the Labor Council gave the bottlers to
understand that now that their practices were
known to the national union and the Labor
Council, they had to be stopped as jeopardizing
the bottlers' conditions and discrediting the
union movement at large, the then Bottlers'
Union No. 102 refused to obey the orders of
Its national, which had paid to it more than
?U000 in lockout benefits, and in duo coursa
was suspended and its charter canceled. Bot
tlers' Union No. 2!>3 was then formed from
members of suspended local No. 102 and from
bottlers who had been refused admittance to
local No. 1U2. but who had been allowed to
work with union bottlers as "reserves."
Violation of Trades Union Rules.
as to the causes which led the National
Union of the brewers and bottlers to suspend
Bottlers' Union No. 102 this only need be
said: During last year's strikes and lockouts
the Labor Council had requested all those
unions who were not Involved to keep their
members at their own work, being careful not
to do the work or' trades locked out or on
strike. In violation of this request, and with
out the sanction of the union, the secretary of
Bottlers' union No. 10-J called out the bot
tlers irom the Gambr.nus Bottling Works be
cause some beer had been taken to these works
by non-union teamsters. That caused the
lockout of all the bottlers, except in the En
ttrprise Brewery, which refused to lock them
out. . - . â¢ â¢ -â¢ .
The Building Trades Council has ordered
since March i a strike of Its affiliated un.ons
against Carpenters" Union No. 48J because
that union insists in remaining loyal to the
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners
and because It attiliutcs With the State Fed
eration o( Labor and the Labor Council. The
rtason the Building Trades council give3 tor
such a strika Is that the Building Trades
Council torbids any building trades union to
belong to any other central body; that the
Building Trades Council shall have control
and say as to the action oi building trades
unions. Claiming this lor itself, the Building
trades Council takes up matters entirely out
of Its sphere and jurisdiction and levies a boy
cott on a union brewery. The injustice, nav
the absurdity of this acUon is plain . anil
palpable.
We trust that' all fair-minded people will
Ignore this boycott as unjubt and as tending
t.o disciedlt the efforts of the workers to im
prove-their conditions. If employers granting
union conditions to members of bona fida
uno.ns can be boycotted for no cause by out
side parties, employers will naturally oppose
all unions. t
The Enterprise Brewery, which has been
and is one ot the best union breweries of this
city, which was the flrst to adopt the. union
label and the nrst to give eight hours to its
brewers and bottlers, signed a few days ago
I an agreement with Bottlers' Union Mo. 'Â£>(,
the proprietors desiring to continue the use
of the union label both on keg and bottle beer.
i The agreement guarantees eight hours, fair
wages and exclusive employment of union
botclers. For this the Enterprise Brewery la
â¢ to be boycotted by the Building Trades Coun
! cil. ' --
First to Adopt Union Label.
The Enterprise Brewery, a strictly union
brewery, has been- placed under boycott by the"
BuiiiLng Trades Council. That council, com
posed oi building trades unions omy, has no
grievance against the Enterprise Brewery for
violation or any trade rules of Ha affiliated
unions. The boycott is levied, as stated, by
the Build.ng Trades, Council in behalr ofÂ« Bot
tlers' Union No. lo^, a .union wnich has been
suspended by its national union for open and
continued violations oi the orders of the na
tional union aud tor practices which tended
to involve all ot the brewing trades in senoiib
disputes with their employers. The 1 Labor
Council also suspended that union. The local
executive committee of the United Urewery
Workmen, composed of unions of brewers,
drivers and bottlers, received charter No. 2lÂ»o
for the reorganized bottlers. Therefore Bot
tlers' Union ts'o. 203 Is the only bona ttde union
of that calling.
The Executive Committee of the San
Francisco Labor Council met yesterday
afternoon and prepared a statement
aglnst the action of the Building Traces
Council taken last .Thursday night in
levying a ; boycott on the Enterprise Brew
ery. This action on the part of the ex
ecutive committee was taken in accord
ance with instructions issued by the La
bor Council. It ia asserted in the state
ment that the Enterprise Brewery is a
stanch supporter of the unions and that
the boycott against it is unjustifiable

mand, at full prices, for lots between Geary,
Eddy,. Van Ness and Octavla. .'Buyers seek lots
there for the purpose of erecting flats. Credit
auction sales, the curse of real estate, and the
Inevitable Intoxicating effects of- a- boom, have
not yet appeared, and we hope they will not.
Thomas Magee & Co.'s Real Estate Cir
cular reports that there are far more buy
ers than sellers of good business proper
ties and that the prices are full. The cir
cular says: ">
There is very little Epeculation in the mar
ket to account for the advance of the last two
years.* Most of the property bought on the
rise has been purchased for actual needs, and
the price paid for it may be reasonably Judged
to be in accordance with the use to which it is
desired to put It. Another fact to be kept In
mind. Is that rents are on the rise Instead of
being. on the decline. Nor is this artificial. It
is due to the fact that the city's business ami
population are growing. More is doing and
more people are here to do it than ever in the
history of this city. The evidences of this
condition are apparent on every side. R must
also be taken into consideration that with the
undoubted increase of the population there are
fewer persons out of work than at most periods
In the past. ' There is more work, there Is more
manufacturing, there is more business, there
are more stores and offices and dwellings, and
less vacancies, than ever before. The growth
and prosperity are substantial. Real estate is
worth more, as It can be made more profitable
than In the past. The conditions of the nine
ties have passed, probably never to return. A
new era has set in with regard to real estate
In San Francisco.
The second month of the -present year
made a very fine record in the realty way
in this city. The sales amounted to $2,-
D9S.735. numbering 440. The mortgages
amounted to $l,704,S92 and the releases
from mortgage to $1,504,236. Speaking oÂ£
the general conditions in this city, the
Real Estate Record, published by G. H.
Umbsen & Co., says:
There Js an interesting rumor in circu
lation concerning the bonding .of proper
tics in the Mission on a large scale, "iPar
ties owning lots in the block bounded by
Valencia, Klgin Park, Thirteenth and
Hermann streets have given options, upon
their holdings. The work has been going
on very quietly. One story is that the site
is wanted for a depot for some transcon
tinental line that may enter the city,
using electricity for motive power: inside
the limits. At least one real estate man
in the city believes this surmise to be cor
rect, ajid he mentions the Gould interest
as likely to be interested. Owners of land
in this particular block have raised their
prices. No one is able to say why the
property is being bonded with the txeep
tion of an official of â¢ the Hibernia Bank,
who has been picking up options as far na
possible, and he will not talk.

The District Council of Carpenters 'and
Joiners has issued the following state
ment regarding the differences between
the Building Traded Council and the San
Francisco Labor Council:
Want No Strikes.
Editor of San Francisco Call â Dear Sir:
This council begs to hand you herewith an
answer to certain articles appearing in yester
day's press under captions of '"They all favor
the navy yards. The Congressmen define their
position to Labor Council. To end strife among
unions. Carpenters eagerly awaiting: arrival
of Delegate Grimes," etc.- Mr. Editor,- the
articles referred to, this council believes, were
given out for the purpose of deceiving the con
tractors and journeymen, as also the general
public. -Â¦Â¦
The artlcla quoted is absolutely - false in so
far as it refers to the anxiety of the carpen
ters or other unions engaged in the building
business. It is designed to confuse and mis
lead the contractors and general public, but it
is idle for - any one engaged in that business
to try that with the '.union men In this or the
Building Trades Council. During the past a
few men have been going around this city giv
ing out circulars filled with falsehood and mis
representation of all descriptions, and inter
viewing contractors and Journeymen in the
same manner in connection with this matter,
with & view to giving the Labor Counteil con
trol over the building industry of this city,
so they could do, during the coming summer,
as they did during- the last â call, out without
any grievance whatever the Building Material
Teamsters, and tie up the contractors and
journeymen alike in one grand knot. '
"We want none of the' Labor Council's
strikes. The Building Trades Council, and
that council only. Is charged with the dutlea
of guiding the destinies of the building indus
try, and so far as the journeymen's end of
It is at least concerned, and it cannot and
will not divide that responsibility with any
other central body not an intergal part of the
building Industry. We must prevent strikes;
we must endeavor to protect the contractors In
the different departments of the building in
dustry as well as the Journeymen and owners,
and this can only be done by the Building
Trades Council attending to the business of its
own organizations without any interference
from any outside and disinterested body.
It follows then that all this talk about Mr.
Grimes, or any one else from the East, or
from any other part of the country, bringing
with him so-called | brotherhood authority, is,
If at all, eent out with, a view to clouding
the issue and deceiving those who would other
wise be good, loyal, true union men. This,
as we have said before, is in San Francisco,
and in fact in any- part of the State, a hope
less task. The Building Trades Council has
made the brotherhood in this district, and in
this State, what it is to-day; this district
council is the council of this district and it
will continue to be such, regardless of who
comes or goe<?, and in or out of the brother
hood it will be the district council that will
do the business of this and Mr.
Grimes or anybody else who doeen f t like it
can move it; and If, as the article quoted says,
Mr. Grimes or anybody else does any sus
pending they will be the losers.
District Would Be Richer.
This district would be more than $35,000
richer to-day if it were not affiliated with the
brotherhood. In other' words, we have given
the brotherhood that much more than the broth
erhood has returned for benefits of all sorts.
"What has become of this money? They have
spent It In the Eastern cities and towns and
then. If you please, talk about suspension. Let
Mr. Orlmes and his Eastern colleagues while
at home violate. If they will, the constitution
which they have been elected to uphold, but
we will see that if he works here he will carry
the Building Trades Council card and no other
and while doing: so he will be upholding Â¦ the
best laws ever ordained by any central body
of laboring men that has ever come together In
this or any other State, in this or any other
country.
Trusting, Mr. Editor, that you will please
give this a position in your paper suitable to
its Importance, and the amount of benefits
which will accrue from it to those who would
otherwise be deceived by the article of yester
day, which emanated from the enemies of le
gitimate organized labor, we are, respectfully
yours,

JOINERS. â

Some months ago Carpenters' Union No
4S3, whose delegate, Walter H. Goff, is
president of the San Francisco Labor
Council, was forced to withdraw from
that body. After several w%?ks the mat
ter was adjusted and Goff wÂ»s reinstated.
The issue has been raised again and'indi
cations point to a sharp drawing of lines
between the two organizations.

The sale of the Folsom-street block by
the board of trustees was consummated
Just before the meeting was announced
, by the chair, whereupon Supervisor Hor
ace Wilson said he had' opposed the sale
of the same property ten years ago for
$200,000 and he was opposed to It now at
any price. He believed the property was
worth much more than $90,000 and said
that within the next few years a much
larger sum might be secured. Mr. Gal
lagher also opposed the proposition, but
when the resolution confirming the sale
was put to a vote It was almost unani
mously carried. .
Librarian "Teggert reported that there
were 3700 members In tho Institute. Tho
number of volumes In tho library was

competence, carelessness and a few .other
things against Librarian F,red J.Teggert.
but his demand that a committee of five
be appointed to Investigate the charges
failed to receive a second. Healy at
tempted to argue the question, but Chair
man Irving declined to recognize him and
the matter was permanently shelved. .
Wilson Says Block Is "Worth More.
j The board of trustees of the Mechanics'
Institute at its annual meeting last night
received a check for, $90,000 in full pay

known as block No. 48. A resolution was
subsequently adopted at .a tjeneral meet
ing of the members conlirminf; the sale
of â¢ the property to the American Steel
and Wire Company of New. Jersey for
the sum specified. There wajj some oppo

Attorney Atterbury says that a man*
ager will arrive* from the East soon, but
will not take full control for some lnÂ«
dcllnite period. The street car conductors
and gripmen are very anxious for this
new manager to arrive, as they feel as
sured that with Vining out of the man
agement they will, obtain more liberty.
The etreetr car employes' chief cause of
complaint is that they are shadowed day
and night by "spotters." They say that
on or off duty they are followed by de
tectives and. should they enter a saloon
they are soon afterward discharged from
the service of the company. They also
complain that on their day off "spotters"
follow them and they are not even then
allowed to go into a saloon and take one
drink. This shadowing has become very
Irksome to the men and with the appoint
ment of a new manager they think that
blighter days wtll come.
A large amount of the purchase money
will remain. in New York and will simpiy

dence the couple will tour Europe. They
expect to be abroad three months.
Mrs. Hancock Is a very beautiful wo
man. She has a splendid voice and is
highly accomplished. Mr. j Hancock is
well known to all lovers of athletics. He
is more than 6 fxet In height and built in
proportion. For many years he was the
Olympic Club's star performer. He repre
sented the winged "O" on many fields
and usually bore the emblem to victory.
Besides being a sprinter, Mr. Hancock is
an all-round athlete. . He is a very
wealthy man and devotes his leisure to
looking after his property interests.
No one was to know of the marriage
until six months had passed, but intimate
friends became suspicious and gossiped
among themselves. This precious morsel
of gossip In time became widespread and
to avoid unpleasantness Mr. Hancock was
forced to announce his marriage to the
world.
Under the laws ot thin Btato neither
party could marry until a year had
t-lapeed from the time a decree of divorce
had been granted. They therefore de
cided to silently slip away to Nevada and
be married. Without informing any one
of their intention the couple left this city
and Journeyed to the new Grctna Green
and were Joined in the bonds of matri
mony.

The mere fact that the title to the office 1*
Incidentally involved In this proccedlnc does

If the payment of the salary of Justices'
cleric to the defendant, who does not lawfully
hi.Jd the office, would be an unlawful expendi
ture of public moneys, euch payment may be
enjoined et the tsutt cf any taxpayer.
Flnce neither Fredrick nor Windrow has
tiÂ«-en appointed by the Beard of Supervisors,
neither can be 6ald to be a d: Jure officer, and
the payment of the salary Incident to the of
fice to any one oth^r thun one holding the law
ful title 'to the office would bo an unlawful
expenditure of public money*. It U unneces
sary to consider whether Fredrick Is a de
facto officer. Inasmuch as a de facto officer
ih not entitled to receive the ealary of the
f.fftre. The act relird upon by counsel for the
tttt ndant as overcoming the rule of the cases
la*t cited ha*, in our opinion, no application,
Â«â¢ It relates only to officers holding under a

We Â«re of the opinion that the provisions of
*e<-Ucn 1 of chapter VII of the charter of tho

WASHINGTON DODGE. Assessor
This Is but one of many such cases; anothe
was the Lloyd Tevls estate. It serves to show,
however, how a public officer Is often mis
represented In the public press . without a
shadow of justification by the ignorant or
foolish.
On? of Many Cases.
To ll!ustiate: On October 10, 18D9, Mr.
Platt, as "expert" of the personal property
committee,' directed a communication to Uu
Beard o' Supervisors stating that he had "In
vestigated" the records of the Probate Depart
ment nnd found property inventoried nnd ap
praised belonging to the estate of Charlotte
A. I^ynch amounting to $X4,000, and etatlnj;
that it should be added to the ..assessment roll.
Th<r board then gravely passed a resolution
calling the attention of the Assessor tp the
matter. The Assessor, who keeps a deputy
In the Probate Court the greater part of the
year, knew the facts, and knew further thai
the "money" â SrHMOl*â In the estate was not
taxable to the estate as It was In a savings
bank and the bank paid the tax: that tht
"bonds" â $7'XM) â were quasi-public bonds and
so exempt from taxation according to law;
that the "other property" In the estate was
real estate which was already taxed, so that
the proportion to tax all this property was
absurd.- v'-"V<
Makes Illustration.
I Mr. Platt seriously asks why I did not
Bfsecs personal property in estates, as shown
by Inventory, when ordered to <lo so by resolu
tion of the Board of Supervisors. The Hoard
or Supervisors In 18SW, at Mr. Platt's Instiga
tion, paspod numberless resolutions "Instruct
ing" the Assessor to assess property In estates
according to Inventory on file. I Ignored all
these resolutions for the obvious reason that
the property was not assessable according to
law, but the board, on Mr. Platt's motion, still
continued to pays such resolutions. I have
nfver explained to Mr. Plstt the law In this
matter, as he Is an "expert," but am willing
to explain the matter to the public.
Mr. Matt savs I do not Inform the merchant
R2 to what constitutes exempt merchandise, as
to the non-taxability of goods in transit; that
I assess solvent credi'.n at their face value; do
not Include in such money in bank, etc. etc.
These charges are false and ridiculous. There
are not one, but hundreds of merchants who
have had the benefit of every exemption men
tioned by him. His view and mine might have
clashed at- times, for I stood for the interests
of -the taxpayers at large, he ror the Interest
ot his particular client, who might, as was th.?
case In that of a certain large firm, refuse to
ray him his fee if their assessment was not

A DECISION was filed by Judges Cook, Sloss and Murasky yesterday holding that section I, chapter VII of the city charter, governing, the appointment of Clerk to the Justices of the Peace is invalid. The reasons gizen by the court arc that
the Justices' Court of San Francisco is part of the judicial system of the State, and that the general laics of the State zuhich vest the Justices with power to appoint their clerk, subject to confirmation by the Board of Supervisors, neces
sarily govern. This ruling, if sustained by the Supreme, Court, will depose Poivcl Fredrick, Mayor Schmitz' appointee as clerk, vice E. IV. Williams, zvliozvas suspended for cause, and subsequently resigned.

try to induce American champions of boa
ing, fencing and wrestling to so to Eng
land during coronation week, there to
meet the best men Great Britain and
ether countries of Europe can produce.
What we chiefly want is the champions
of the army and navy. They must be
men at present in the country's service
and not like Tom Sharkey. who, although
formerly in the United States navy, has
been a professional for years.
We will also try to get Harvard and
Yalo to send their best boxera to Eng

ident of our club, has offered a cup as
a prize for the winner of a boxing contest
between Harvard and Oxford. The Earl
of Kingston will also offer a cup for the
winner cf a contest between the boxers
of Yale and Cambridge.
"The chief feature of the tournament
will be a tug-of-war between twelve
picked men of Europe and twelve of the
United States. Amateurs will receive
trophies and the professionals cash prizes.
"The. club has a belt valued at Sdow
which will be given in addition to a large
money prize to the best heavyweight pro
fessional boxer. He must be the best his
country can produce. No second-rate
man will be considered. The contest will
be held in Covent Garden, London. If we

S Give me a man broken down from dissipation, hard work or worry,

2 man of his age.
5 I will not promise to make a Hercules of a man who was never in-

Â§ ter than he is; but the man who has been strong and has lost his strength ,
0 I can make as good as he ever was.
Â© ' I can give back to any man what he has lost by violation of the laws

69 badly, awakes more tired than when he went to bed, who is easily dis- ,

2 which the Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt supplies.
q The whole force of vitality in your body is dependent upon your ani-

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 8.
Â¦ Another turn has been taken to the out
break of trouble in the Alameda County
1 Christian Endeavor Union over the stand
â¢ Ing- of County President W. M. Bird.
Prior to his election Bird had been ac
cused of mistreating his children. There
â¢was an Investigation by the Endeavor So
ciety of the Alden Presbyterian Church,
Â¦with" which Bird is affiliated. He was ex
â¢ onerated.
But on top of that came the Trinity
Methodist Church Endeavor Union of
Berkeley, which adopted resolutions that
Its committee believed the county presi
dent should be above suspicion.
The resolutions stirred Bird's friends
and there Is more difficulty at hand. Tho
charges, It Is understood, originally had
fathering in the Berkeley church. In ths
face of Bird's election to the highest
honor in the gift of the county union.
Trinity Church is not satisfied, nor is it
satisfied with the exoneration of Bird by
his own union.
It Is now on the programme that the
whole flght shall be reopened by an Inves
tigation to be conducted by the Alamcda
County Union and directed against the
Berkeley Union for its attitude. In other
words, the charges will not down. Bird's
supporters, who feel secure In their be
lief In his innocence, arc desirous, It is
asserted, of forcing an issue with the peo
ple who are still unwilling to accept tho
situation.
If the investigation shall be held it Is
intimated that the Trinity Church Union
â¢will be brought to account for Its position
in the Bird matter.
SISTERS QUARREL OVER

Both Want to Be Guardian, but Court
Is Perplexed as to^Which

OAKLAND, March 8.â The Quarrel of
two sisters. Mrs. Celia Johnson and Mre.
Elizabeth Waltz, as to which should have
the custody of their mother, Mrs. Celia
Lindsay, who has become so old that she
cannot manage her property Inter
ests properly, was renewed to-day
in Judge Ellsworth's court. Mrs.
Johnson wanted to have her mother de
clared incompetent and be appointed
guardian bo that she could take her to
her home In Carson, Nev. This proposi
tion was opposed by Mrs. Waltz, who
wants the appointment for guardian " for
herself.
Durlngr the hearing Mrs. Johnson threw
fiery glances at her sister and made her
self ro obnoxious that the court had to
admonish her to be quiet.' She wanted
to address the court, but Judge Ellsworth
would not permit It.
Judge Ellsworth finally took the case
under advisement.' He declined to appoint
Mra. Johnson guardian, saying that if she
took her mother out of the State she
would probably never bring her back.

Judge Hall finally granted a decree set

the husband should have made more
searching inquiries to ascertain if his first
wife was dead.
The second Mrs. Mansfield, upon learn

now that the llrst wife is dead, she does
not consent to remain married, she re
plied that she has conscientious scruples
against such contracts.
In 1SS7 Mansfield married the woman
who is now suing him. The Rev. Dr.
Hcrton, a former pastor of the First

a reason for changing his name the dis

Baltimore, where he met his first wife.
He was a little confused as to names, but

How he met death is not certain. His
friends think the old man became bewil

mistook the trestle for the Eighth-street
bridge. He either fell or was knocked off
the trestle by a train. v .
He had three brothersâ Antonio, Jeaquln
and Victorâ all dead.- His name will be
perpetuated, for in Oakland is Castro
street, in San Francisco a like-named
thoroughfare and Castro Valley also car

Of late years the old man lived at E. A.
Haines' . place. Tenth and Harrison
streets; caring for horses anu having a
home for his beloved companion satisfied
the declining Spaniard. But recently old
age and illness had compelled him to
abandon the steed he had ridden for
years. Almost in rags, old Cabtro. refused

THE BOEB "WAR IS COSTING
GBEAT BBITAIN HEAVILY
Besides Actual Expense of Money,
the Shrinkage in. Values
Is Stupendous.
The stupendous fall in British Govern
ment, railroad and Industrials securities
since the South African war commenced
is almost without precedent. Â¦
In two years, the Bankers' Magazine
says, the net decrease in the value of 325
selected securities amounts to the enor
mous total of Â£143.946.000 ($719,7C0.OC!0). Con
sols, which the day before the Boer ulti
matum were quoted at 103%. are now
91 13-10, whereas in the same period sev
eral foreign government stccks and Amer
ican railroads rose in value about Â£47,
000.000 ($235,000,000).
The decrease in fourteen British and
Indian Government funds amounted to
Â£76,292.000 ( $351,900,000). The common stock
of nineteen British railroads lost in value
in the war period over Â£69,000,000 ($345,103.
000), while the decline in railroad deben
tures and preferences brings the total loss
in railroad securities to over Â£100,000,003
($500,000,000).
New York City has thirty Japanese
Methodists. . . . _ . . .
Miss Emily Lawless Is most widely
known for her novels, but she is also a
poetess. A volume of verse from her pen
will appear soon. She had it printed for
private circulation some time ago and
now the public is to get it, with an in
troduction by Stopford . Brooke. It has
the title "With the Wild Geese." a title
which arises in Ihls way: "Wild gees"e"
was the name given by the , romantic,
sorrowful Imagination of the Irish to' the
exiles, who, like wild birds with their
wailing cry, emigrated to the Continent
before and after the battle of Aughrim
and the surrender of Limerick, in 1691.
The volume is to be published by Isbister.
A new volume by Edward Marston. the
well-known publisher, will j appear early
in the spring through his firm. It is a
series of sketches of | the booksellers In
the time of Dr. Johnson. Broadly speak
ing, . bookseller: and- publisher were then
one and the same. Marston's sketches so
deal with them. He begins, with Michael
Pemberton's output.is not excessive. As
a rule he writes two stories, each of about
eighty thousand words, every year. He
has a very individual way of writing his
Tiovels. First he writes out the story him
self, using many contractions and abbre
viations. This manuscript he reads to his
typist, who leaves very wide margins be*
tween the lines for transcription. Pern
berton then goes through' it again, alter
ing, adding and then* has a clean type
written copy prepared for .the printer.
Even then. he is not content and habit
ually makes many alterations in the
proof. Wtyle . his stories are appearing
serially ho often revises them consider
ably before they appear in the final book
form.
Max Pemberton's new story, "I .Crown
Thee King," will be published by Messrs.
Methuen during the spring, and "The
House Under the Sea," now appearing in
the Strand Magazine, will be published in
the autumn. After that will come "The
Gold Wolf," a powerful, realistic. study of
an ultra-modern millionaire.
If little fiction is coming out Messrs.
Elkin & Mathews are to put on the mar
ket a' guide to the historical branch of
fiction. It has been prepared by J. Nield,
and is the result of much careful inquiry
and patient work. The author has aimed
at producing a book which may be useful
in at least three ways. First, it will meet
the demand which is being made with in
creasing force by parents and education
ists, by giving a descriptive list of some
eight hundred historical romances sug
gestive of a course of reading for boys
and girls. Second, the guide will be of
service to all lovers of romantic literature.
Third, it may hope in some measure to
lessen the labors of librarians and book
sellers.
Comparative quietness still reigns In

some cases the portraits of these celeb
rities of the old-time world have been ob

A, popular library of art, planned ex
pressly for the general public. Is to be
issued by Messrs. Duckworth. It is
thought that amid many monographs of
art there is room for just such a series,
which will appeal to the man who wants
to know about the great artists and their
work rather than to one who already
knows them well. On the other hand it
is hoped that every volume may contain
an appreciative criticism from fresh
points of view which will be suggestive
even to the learned. The first two vol
umes will be on Albert Durer ana
Rossettl, the writer in the one case be
ing Miss Una Eckensteln and in the other
Ford Maddox Hueffer.
The other contributors will be Miss
Clementina Black, W. S. Chesson, Edward
Garnett and G. K. Chesterton.
A gentleman who has kept track of
the newspaper accounts of prosecutions
and the official returns \of convictions
published in the regular reports of the
judiciary has a record of 9105 sentences
of imprisonment since William II as
cended the throne in 1889. They average
three months each, and represent a toial
of 2242 years of imprisonment. Among
those convicted were seven children un

and 15, forty-eicht between 15 and 13 and
l&J between li ar;d 2L In all 256 boys un

A certain German- America?, from Chi
cago 1 believe, while- excited with wine
in one of the Berlin cafes expressed
with great freedom his opinion of the
German Government and Emperor Wil
liam. His remarks were overheard by two
officials sitting at an adjoining table, who
filed a formal complaint to the police.
The American Embassador succeeded in
securing the rel*ase of the culprit with
great difficulty, but was required to give
au assurance that he would leave Ger
many at once.
A story is told about the arrest of two
men In a cafe who were overheard to de
clare that the Emperor was a fool and a
jackass. . When arraigned in court they
declared that they referred to the Em
peror of China, and had so informed the
policeman who arrested them, but the
latter took the ground that such epithets
were not likely to be applied to any but
Emperor William of Germany. The hu
morous side of the explanation struck
several incautious editors, so that not less
than a dozen persons were convicted of
lese majeste in connection with that one
affair.
Some of the arrests in Germany for
lese majeste certainly appear very silly.
Early in the reign of the present Empe
ror a respectable girl of 19 at Breslau was
sent to jail for. merely criticising a pic
ture of the Kaiser which was exposed as
an advertisement in a shop window. At
Cologne a girl of 17, of excellent charac
ter, was imprisoned for six months be
cause Ehe tore to pieces a portrait of the
Kaiser which had formerly been tacked
to the wall of her own room. Herr Tro
jan, editor of Kladderadatsch, a comic
paper, served a long sentence for publish
ing a cartoon representing Julius Caesar,
Alexander the Great, Leonidas and other
warriors bf ancient history reading a
speech delivered by the Emperor in which
his Majesty said that no man could be a
good soldier unless he was a good Chris
tian.
"It is recommended that immediate
steps be taken to prevent the destroying:
of the gutta percha trees by the natives"
In gathering the product, and that sam
ples of the so-called gutta percha, some
of which are forwarded with this report,
be subjected to careful chemical analysis
r>y a recognized authority upon this sub
ject, and that if such report warrants
n special expedition, under the general su
r>crvlEion of the forestry division of the
Philippines, be sent out at an early date
to determine the location, extent, quan
iltv etc. of this product, with a view to
focu'ring ' f or the Government what may
prove a most valuable and lasting indus
try in these islands."
An Ingenious headmaster in North Wales
Y*sji calculated tha* the British boy loses
<->n a.n averace of 273 â¢whole school days by
the clumsiness of the present system of
tvetehta and measures. The cure, he says,
is the metric system^
Some 14ca of the vast -wealth of London
may be gathered from the fact that the
flre Insurance carried by the metropolis
1k now 54.C5Q.000/viO. Canada's flre insur
ance amounts to 5756,257,033.
"Due to the large demand, gutta percha
is now secured from the dry leaves, bark
snd twigs of the trees by an entirely me
chanical method, thus preserving the
irees themselves, which can yield indefi
nitely. It is claimed for this process,
which is now in operation in Singapore,
that whereas only about one-sixty-fourth
part of the gutta percha is obtained by
the native, the leaves and twigs are found
to contain 9 to 10 per cent of clean gutta
percha. and that as high as 3 per cent has
been extracted from the bark stripped off
-trees which have been left on the ground
by the natives for three or four years as
useless.
"It may be said there Is no doubt
that there are large quantities of so-called
Â£Uita. percha in the southern islands of
tne Philippine archipelago, and that the
extent ana value of this product can only
be determined by carelul prospecting and
examination by recognized gutta percha
experts.
â¢ine market at present for the Sulu
E.rchipelago is Singapore and not Manila.
There is everv eviaence that the buyers
in Singapore, due to the scarcity and re
cent great profits to be made in gutta
percha. are looking for the purchase of
v.hatever product can be obtained from
the Philippines, and I have evidence of a
Kingle shipping of gutta percha from Cot
tabato to Singapore which netted the
Singapore dealer $30,000.
"As stated above, the Singapore dealers,
who are posted as to the value of this
) roduct. naturally are interested that no
knowledge of the subject shall be ob
tained, and. in fact, none of the natives,
nor, indeed, any of the inhabitants, appre
ciate the present value of gutta percha as
a commercial product in the world's mar
ket.
The trans-Pacific cable "will consume
about 3,000,000 pounds of gutta percha, and
the army signal officers are somewhat
concerned lest the demand seriously af

/ UNHAPPY MARRIAGES;
r y MARGARET L. BRIGGS.
(ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.)
Although it does not seem possible, some women never find out the
likes and dislikes of their husbands. Men for the most part haye decided
opinion* about dress and the furnishings of the h^use, although they are
usually bashful about them and rarely acknowledge them. Women ignore
these things, yet expect their husbands to live up to the love of the
courtship days, a time when a woman carries out even the slightest sug-
gestion from the man she loves.
There is one wife I know whose husband would like to see the house
filled with friends, entertained by his wife dressed in her prettiest way.
Tet rarely are visitors welcomed to that house, and often when they do
come the husband is mortified at his wife's appearance. Not that she is
unclean, or anything of that kind. But she does not bother to keep up
with the new little wrinkles of fashion, and more often than not she is
dowdy and even shabby In appearance. Some men would not care about
these thingsâ her husband does, and It seems a pity she should not take
the little trouble necessary to please him.
Then there is the woman who is always sick. Of course, her husband
is sorry about it and sympathizes with her and loves her all the more.
But If that woman has some nervous or female trouble that makes her
unhappy and irritable all the time, and she Is continually complaining
and never doing anything to get well, by and by her husband gets tired
of it He stays away from homeâ one evening this week, perhaps more
in a few weeks, always mare and moreâ until the wife wakes up with a
start some day to find that the companionship between herself and her
husband is gone. '
She braces up and tries to get well. She fixes her. gowns up prettily,
she drops the fretful conversation at the table, she gets up little parties
and excursions that she thinks her husband will enjoy, but nothing
brings him back. What a man has tired of will never attract him again.
When a woman is continually sick, this day with . a . headache, tfie
next perhaps with a pain in her sideâ when there Is always some ailment
tnat unfits her for her duties, when she Is irritated and nervous and blue
â when a woman gets in this condition she may be sure there is some-
thing wrong with her generative organs, that she has some one of those
feminine troubles which seemingly amount to so little, but eventually
make life almost unbearable.
It is useless and foolish for a woman to wÂ»lt until these troubles
bring constant pain, until nervousness and irritability have estranged
all her friends. The time to take them in hand is when they begin,
when the only signs are a few mutterings of pain at the monthly period,
and nervousness and weariness. If she does this she will bring happi-
ness to herself and all those about her, and she will not tire her husband
with her continual complaints, many of which seem to him visionary. If
any woman as soon as she feels like complaining, as soon as she feels
sick she hardly knows from what, will take Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound, she .can be sure she will be cured. The mysterious aches and
pains that women have so often are always the result of some uterine trou-
ble. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound gets at the root of these
troubles and cures them. All the backache and headaches, all the feeling
of exhaustion that make the day's work seem unbearable, are overcome
by this medicine. "When a woman feels as though she simply cannot dress,
when the daily bath becomes a hardship, when It Is an Effort to be pleasant
and to exercise those little arts to please that our sex understand so well,
let the woman take warning. It }s the natural thing for a woman to make
herself attractive and charming. When she is strqng and healthy she does.
that as involuntarily as she breathes; when she doesn't do it she is sick.
Let her then write to Mrs. Pinkhatn. Lynn. Mass.. for advice, and take
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. ,

to the section, but which by long abandon
ment and neglect has been greatly damaged,
is being considered as the best and cheapest
means of getting water to the mines. It Is
estimated that $10,000 will be required to put
the ditch in serviceable condition. . Â¦

The Dale Is very much In need of a first
class large stamp mill. There are several
crude Email affairs here and though they do
not answer the needs of the camp they are
making money. Sabbathe & Kllliun have been
cperatlnff a two-stamp mill here for sever,
years and have made It a very profitable busi
ness. The same Is true with the two-stamp
mill owned by the Meachams. The Brooklyn
mill, a three-stamp affair, Is the largest in
the camp, and It has coined money pounding
out ore, and It has done this while paying
for water at 0 cents a gallon. There is plenty
of ore here, rich ore. though it needs energy
and skill to get it out. and there is an elegant
opening for a large stamp mill.

- A rumor is given circulation by the
Mining and Scientific Press that two men
took out gold to the value of $3000 recently
as the result of one day's clean-UD at
Lotus, El Dorado County, two miles from
Coloma, tho site of the discovery of the

There are many millions of dollars'
worth of saline deposits in Death Valley.
If the estimates that have been made by
Professor Bailey for State Mineralogist
Aubury are correct, the amount is in the
hundreds of millions of dollars' worth.
All the facts will be published soon in a
pamphlet or bulletin to be issued by the
State Mining Bureau. , The story that
Professor Bailey tells will be quite a sur
prise to the majority of the inhabitants of
this State, for Death Valley has not gen
erally been regarded as a great store
house of wealth. The saline deposits have
atiracted' a great deal of attention lately.
Lp.rge tracts of lands on y which are saline
deposits have been take v n up by citizens
of this State. The bulletin, of the State
Mining Bureau will give an amount of
valuable information which will be eager
ly sought.
There is Interest in the account giver*
by the Daily Mining Review of Denver
of the bromide process which is being
tried at Colorado City. The claim is
niide that by its use ore as low as $3
per ton can be profitably handled. Ac
cording to the Mining Kecord, the ores
of Cripple Creek are almost identical with
those of the Kalgourlie district in Aus
tralia, where the process was tried, on a
large scale. The company that owns the
right for the Western Hemisphere is
composed of New York moneyed men.
The work begins at Colorado City with
a mill capable of handling 125 tons per

The Bull Run district is now being de
veloped by one company only, and there
Is only one company working in the White
Rock district. Willis says that there is
an abundance of cheap power on the
Snake River in Idaho not more than
sixty-five miles distant that can be util
ized. At Mardls the King Solomon Min
ing Company is erecting a twenty-stamp
mill to handle gold ores. A copper belt
is reported to extend from Lone Moun
tain to Bullion, a distance of about forty
miles. Â¦ Â¦ **
William Willis writes to the Elko, Nev.,
Free Press an account of mineral opera
tions hi Elko County. He says that Elko
County has produced more than 150,000,000
in gold, silver, copper and lead. Among
the old-time camps in the county, Tusca
rora heads tho list with a record of $20,
000,000 in gold and silver, all of which
came from a comparatively shallow level,
something like 600 feet There is no
smelter in the county and there is no cus
toms smelter In the State, and nearly all
the ores have to bear heavy railroad
charges besides sampling and smelting.
The tailing dump of the Metallic Gold Ex

posed to have been worked close.

The following significant statement in

A gule of 1000 acres of land In the New

A town site is being laid out nt Car

Union Company wells have been put

In Los Angeles Judge Trask has decided
a point that is of interest to oil compa-.
nies throughout all the fields. The case
of Spinks vs. Clark & Bryan was on trial.
Counsel wished to investigate certain
books to ascertain the real value of oil
ntocks over which there is a controversy.
Judge Trask decided that tho proper way
to prove stock values is by the market
price, unless it can be shown that the
buyer of the stock was influenced to buy
through misrepresentations of tho value
of the plant.
Value of Oil Stock.
The combine expects to start up drilling on
the San Joaquin and Kern properties at once.
Three rigs are being fitted up now and L. A.
Crandall, an experienced driller; has been ap
pointed superintendent of â¢ the work. It is
thought that other operations will be begun
in the near future, as the Associated Company
is continually making new contracts for oil.
The management reports that the tendency of
prices is upward and confidently believe that
the rate will reach a most satisfactory, point
in the near future.
During the month; of February the new
dally production amounted to 10G0 barrels, a
decline from the previous month's record ot
350 barrels. In averaging the product of a
field, however, the true daily production is not
always indicated. ' When a well pours forth
a volume of oil amounting to between 1 KOOO
and 4000 barrels per day, as has the new well
brought in by the Central Oil Company in the
Whittier field â which is in any case a pro
ductive oneâ the probability is that the aver
age of the entire field will be increased. The
same applie3 to the Fullerton field, where the
Santa Fe and Brea Canyon companies have
brought in "spouters" that have not shown
any very decided decline in production since
settling down to regular work.
Diminishing the amount of oil offered
for sale naturally helps to make a better
price. Contracts are made at much
higher figures for the producers than
vould have been possible a few months
ago.
The JBakersfleld' Callfornian reports the
following from the field of the operations
of the Associated Oil Company:
The tendency in all of the large fields has
been to curtail active work pending an advance
in prices. This has been marked in the Kern
River field, where out of 88 wells drilling work
has been suspended on 68, leaving only 35
upon. which work is being prosecuted. In $he
McKittrick-Sunset field also the 15 rigs noted
a month ago continue the same, and of the
195 wells drilling 12S have suspended, leaving
(1.S upon which drilling is in progress. It is
but right to say, however, that in -the Mc-
Kittrick-Sunset field there, are a number of
wells that have been on the suspended list
so long as to warrant the belief that they have
virtually been abandoned, albeit denial is made
of this fact.
The outlook for the producers of petro
leum in California continues to grow
brighter. Prices that have taken an up
ward tendency show no inclination to re
cede. The Associated Oil Company is
proceeding calmly on its way, preparing
to drill where it may seem, advisable. The
Standard Oil Company is seemingly do
ing its best to hurry the construction of
the pipe line that will connect it with the
Kern River district, and- the sum of
$4,000,000, approximately, is involved in
the pipe line and the operations at Point
Richmond. So, while there is no haste
upon the part of the owners of small
properties outside of the combine to de
velop rapidly, the situation continues to
held its interest very well for &11 con
cerned. The returns . for the month of
February, as compiled by the statistician
of the Los Angeles Herald, show that thÂ«
status of the industry has undergone lit
tle change during one month. The Her
ald says of the February operations in
Caliiornia fields:
Active Work Curtailed.

Potato market was firmer and more active yes
terday and Oregon Burbanks were hlguer.
Strictly fancy stock would have sold above the
quoted prices had . they been obtainable, and
what little fine stock came to hand by the
steamer sold at $1 8of 1 85 per ctl. Owing to
the rain seed Potatoes are quiet, but all kinds
are firmly held. 1. Early Rose are very scarce,
but fresh supplies are due from Vancouver at
any time. The market was bare of Sweet Po
tatoes, but three cars are expected for to
morrow's market. Â¦ .
Fancy Onions were a little hisrher on the
Oregon dock, but the general feeling Is weak.
Asparagus continued to bring high. prices al
though receipts were larger than on the pre

ceipts of Rhubarb were 72 boxes and prices
showed little change. There were no vegetables
received from Los Angeles and carried-over

Peas were received from Alameda County and
owing to the scarcity of Los Angeles stock
higher prices were easily obtained. Mush

NEW TORK/ March 8.â The statement of

day shows: Loan*,' $033,102,100; decrease,

$11,821,000. Circulation, $31,330,000; Increase,
$127,000. Legal tenders. $70,8i5,Â»iO0; decrease,
Sl.ircs.noo. Specie, 1 184, 521). 500; decrease,

crease, $2,030,400. Surplus, $3,038,425; decrease,
$8,017,500.
The Financier says: The statement of the
New York Associated Banks this week' shown
a loss of $8,072,1)00 cash, of which $7,904,000
was specie and $1.0C$,000 legal tenders. The
loss of cash, as estimated from the traceable
movements of money during the week, was
$3,839,000. This, however, did not Include the
average of the loss resulting from the ship
ments of gold to Europe, February 27, nor the
average of one-sixth of the amount shipped on
Saturday last. Thene averages together amount
ed to $2,100,000. The entire amount exported on
Thursday of this week seems to have been in
cluded in the offlclal statement. Adding to the
estimated loss of $3,830,000, as above, the
$2,100,000 averages of the shipments on Feb
ruary 28, and on March 8, would make $5,039,
900. The difference between this sum and the
loss of cash officially reported in the state
ment, or $3,03(1,000, is probably due to an un
recorded movement of money out of the Institu
tions either to near by or to distant points.
The loans of the banks show a decrease of
83,089,100. This Is the first time since January
11 that a decrease has been recorded in this Item
The deposits were reduced $11,821,000, which
amount is only $240,400 less than the aggregate
of the loss of loans and of cash; hence the re
turn harmonizes. The striking feature of the
statement was the loss In surplus reserve. This
was reduced by $6,017,500 to $3,058,425, or
$0,758,830 below the surplus at the correspond
ing period a year ago. It Is noteworthy that
the above is the lowest amount of surplus re
corded since October 20, 1000, when it was
$2,947,700; and also that on March 17 of that
year the reserve was $2,686,425. The net loss
of specie by eight of the Wall-street banks was
$6,100,000. The most important changes In
loans were shown by five of the larger banks
which lost $5,200,000 net. ,

was very quiet. The gain in activity in
Wheat is at expense of the general interest in
Corn and that market lags in consequence.
While the receipts are small the demand con
tinues poor and the high price to a great ex

WHEATâ The foreign markets were firm.
Chicago was strong at a further fractional ad
vance, chiefly on French cables. There was
some increase in speculation, due to continued
dry weather in, the Southwest. The Govern
ment report fa expected on Monday. Exports
from the United States, as given by Brad
street's, since July 1, amount to 45,4su,ooo
bushels. The strength In Wheat Is due more
to lack of offerings than to any buying de
mand. Activity, however, is increasing.
The Chlcaeo letter to Bolton, De ituyter &
Co Bays: "Liverpool unchanged; Paris Vi<v>
IVj'o higher; Antwerp %c higher. Indications
are that tho visible supply will show a deÂ«
crease of possibly a million bushels on Won'
day. Here, although the cables were dtsap

Hatenicnt. showing a cash loss of nearly |lÂ»,-
WH).ooo, which more than doubled the prelim
inary estimates, started selling of the genoral
liFt. Pi ices, however, did not yield much ex
cept in some of the stocks which had notably
advanced earlier and there was no decided
pressure at any point. Some satisfaction was
felt at the loan reduction of *3,000,000. this
being the first in nearly two months. The im
mense cash loss was quite generally attribut
ed to the vagaries of the bank average system.
With surplus reserves down 10 lets than $4,-
OOO.ooo and the gold export movement un
checked, the opinion naturally prevails that
1'igher money rates are imminent. The stock
market closed active and easy.
There has been some movement of prices of
Etccks during the week, but it was by no
means coneiBtent and was not well held, the
market showing a tendency to return to its
former level, whether from advances or de
clines. The money market situation was the
cause of uneasiness, which became rather
acute during the midweek. This was due to
the calling of twenty per cent of the syndi
cate EUbKTlptlons to the San Francisco Trac
tion merger and the announcement that remit
tances WGUld be made tu San Francisco
through the nub-treasury by telegraphic trans
ler. This would mean the withdrawal of
money from the New York market for deposit
at the rub-treasury and its payment Into the
San Francisco market from the sub-treasury
there, an operation which the Government's
large holdings of gold in San Francisco would
make convenient at the Treasury Department.
Well street was mystified in the meantime by
the inquiry at Washington by New York bank
ers as to facilities for transferring in this
way Â£50,000.000 to $00.000,<X>0. This threat
ened an inroad upon New York reserves be
yond anything calculated up to this time and
I rorr.ised a serious situation, in i view of the
low level of the surplus reserves of the banks
and the other requirements for gold exports,
which had to be met. The equanimity of the
speculative mind was somewhat upset in con
sequence and prices were inclined to give way.
They recovered ! when It was announced that
the San Francisco remittances had been ar
ranged through the regular exchange market
and would be settled without an actual move
ment of cash, which those interested in ex
change banking seemed desirous of avoiding.
This episode seemed mainly responsible fnr the
principal rrice movement of the week. The
sensitiveness of. the market to the condition
of money reserves is perfectly reasonable.
With the loan and deposit items of the banks
at higher figures than ever before, the Email
surplus represents an even smaller proportion >
of actual reserves than is indicated by the '
actual reserve. In fact, under the eystem of
computation by averages used by the Clearing
House banks with figures such as those now
involved in deposits and reserves, the present
surplus reserves of the banks must be regard
ed as a purely nominal one and subject to
change either side of the line of legal reserve
limit from day to day in the cash syndicate
Iran operations on the scale now become fam
iliar to the New York market. It may easily
te an Intimate knowledge of the condition of
these large eyndicate loans is the reason for
the unruffled placidity of the money market
ir. face of nominal showing by the banks. The
liquidation of even one individual syndicate
might put a different face upon the whole
money (situation over night. The powerful
combinations which have kept close upon the
available credits gt tho market since the first
of the year have every intention in conserving
the quietude and steadiness of the money mar
ket and are possessed of enormous resources
for doing so. The New York. money market,
however. Is by no means exempt from the In
fluences of foreign markets, by reason of large
obligations still outstanding aa a result of
enormous purchases of American securities
from foreign holders In last year's struggle
for control of transcontinental railroad sys
tems. An a consequence, the requirements by
one foreign center upon another for trans
ferring gold can be shifted upon New York.
That 1* what in being done now by London to
meet the demands of Paris upon that center.
The London Statist estimates that London is
Indebted to Continental money markets to a
rum of (300.000,000 In nhnrt-tlme loans, of
which fully half is owing to French capital
ists. The purpose of the Bank of England
to keep control of the London money market
and keep up the money rate there so hh to
protect that market against withdrawals of
capital Is therefore easily explicable, the more
00 as the end of the British fiscal ye.ir is
approaching and provision must be made for
another large loan to meet the requirements
of the coming year. The Bank of France also
has accumulated the largest stock of gold
ever held In Its vaults, notwithstanding the
dullness of French trade and Industry, indicat
ing preparation for some future special de
mand upon its resources. The situation sup
plements other factors admonishing toward
caution and conservatism In the speculative
employment of capital. The Northern Securi
ties Company case Is an ever present factor
in Wall street consideration. The season of
uncertainty over the country's crop Is always
cne of normal dullness in its speculation and
there remain many labor problems' for the
coming year to be worked out.
Bonds have shown some i decrease from re
cent activity, but the level of prices was well
maintained.

COFFEEâ C. E. Bickford's circular gives the
receipts at this port during the first two
months of tin 1 year at 21.529 bags, against
30 COO during the same time last Â¦ year. The
sales -fiom first' hands were 16.35S bags,
against 19,275. The stock in first hands March
1 was 15.04S bags, against 13,105. The world's
visible supply March 1 was 11.1S0.C93 bags,
against 7,276.025. The circular says:
"Buyers have been and are still pursuing
a watting policy, and February's distribution
here has been consequently unsatisfactory in
volume, although not so as to prices paid,
which show practically no change since the
Oth ultimo. Present quotations are sustained
with some show of firmness under light arrivals
here and the comparatively strong position of
mild coffees generally, which have grown apart
from Brazils although still readily susceptible
of their sympathetic influence. The unusually
large quantity of coffee carried over locally
from last year by second hands and speculators
has enabled dealers to remain away from the
market much longer than was anticipated.
Business has been and is of hand to mouth
character, their ideas being much below' the
prest*it basis for coffee in quantity.
"Receipts in Brazil present the most Im
portant feature and are still very heavy â
twelve and a half millions for this crop to the
present writing, with estimates running as
high as four millions for the balance of the
season (to July 1). There have been recent
rumors of furcr.er-low estimates for next crop,
but t-othing authentic or of real value.

bass Costa Rica. lfiS Nicaragua. 2440 Salvador.
12.303 Guatemala. 231:0 Mexican and 7.872 bass
of other kinds: In all Â£7.727 bags, as against

MAINE FARMER FINDS
PROFIT IN RAISING FOXES
Silver Gray, Bring Fancy
Prices.
Pelts of Some Varieties, Such as the
A small area of an acre and a half of
rough, rocky hillside land in the town of
Dover, Fiscataquls County, is one of the
best paying farms in Maine. It la owned
by Eijah Norton, and while he neither
plows nor reaps, as do other farmers,
yet he makes a good bit of money each
year. He raises nothing but foxes.
The farm is located within a few min
utes' walk of the center of the village,
and is always an interesting place to visit.
It is inclosed by a high wire fence, which
is sunk down into the ground for a depth
of about five feet, so as to prevent the
animals confined within the Inclosure
from burrowing out. That this is a suc
cessful method of confining Revnard is
proved by the fact that in the three years
that the farm has been in existence not a.
fox has escaped.
There are now held captive in the in
closure about fifty animals, silver gray,
Alaska blue and a few of the common
ted foxes. The Alaska blue foxes were
brought to Mr. Norton some years ago
and cost him considerable money, but
they have bred i and increased and their
hides are worth from $30 to $50 each. They
have proved a very paying investment.
The silver gray's fur Is most valuable,
the price quoted always being In the hun
dreds for a single pelt, while a* thousand
dollars for a hide is not uncommon.
The highest price that Mr. Norton ever
received for one of these pelts was $2900.
What makes the fur of the silver gray fox
so valuable is that the robes of many of
the foreign potentates have to be trimmed
with it, and they being very scarce a good
one commands almost any price.
The skin 'of the common red fox is worth
from $1 50 to $3. so that there Is money in
raising them. Still Mr. Norton makes his
greatest efforts with 'the silver gray ani
mals, and so far has been very successful.
The animals are very tame and will
come at a whistle from their owner, and
when he feeds them it is a very Interest
ing sight, for they fight over the scraps
of meat- and bones that are thrown them
like a lot of dogs. The different breeds
are kept in seperate inclosures, the main
inclosure being subdivided by lower
fences, and in each subdivision there is
from one to three small houses for the
protection of the animals in the storms
of summer and during the cold of winter.
â TXJNDON, March' 8.â The head of the
Cunard steamstiip line at Liverpool tele
graphs this morning as follows:
"We know the Etruria is proceeding
slowly and there may be some little time
yet before we hear from her. There is
no ground for uneasiness."
NEW YORK, March S.â A representa
tive of Vernon H. Brown & Co., local
agents of the Cunard . line, said to-day
that no anxiety was felÂ£ because the
Etruria had not been heard from since
she was spoken by the Ottawa 400 miles
west of Fayal on February 28. The Et
ruria, which had lost both propellers and
rudder, was then in tow of the Clyde
liner William Cliff, and was being towed
at the rate of from fifty to sixty miles
a day. The local Cunard line officiate
think the ship may not be reported before
Tuesday or Wednesday.
Mr. Hepworth, the Marconi operator on
board the Cunarder Lucania, which ar
ilved here to-day, did muca wireless talk
ing during the run over.
"Knowing that the Etruria was over
due," sdid Hepworth, "I kept calling her
at frequent . Intervals for the first two
days we were out "this trip. . On Tuesday
night I caught the Campania, eastward
bound, and by this time suspected tnat
something had gone wrong with the
Etruria. I told the Campania to look out
l'or her. I talked with the Campania
operator for about three . hours, sending
a number of messages for the passengers.
I had a talk with the Nantucket ligluahip
last night. The operator there gave me
the first news of the Etruria's accident."

Success.' :

Alden Besse Arrives Leaking.
The bark Alden Besse is the latest arrival
to report damage sustained on the bosom of an
unpaclflc Pacific. She arrived yesterday, nine
teen days from Honolulu, with her deck3
wrecked by heavy seas and leaking at the rate
of two and a half inches per hour. The
A.lden Besse left Honolulu February 9, but
was obliged to put back on account of spring
ing a leak. Eleven hundred tons of sugar were
discharged, repalr3 effected and on February
17 the voyage was resumed. Heavy south
westerly gales were encountered from the be
ginning of thevoyage. These were accompanied
by high seas in which the bark labored heav
ily On March 6, about 400 miles west of San
Francisco an extra severe southwester came
along filling the decks to the rail, smashing
the boat on the starboard quarter, staving in
the galley doors and carrying away the bul
warks on the port side. The main topmast
Â«tay was carried away and the constant strain
and jar of wind and heavy sea coused the bark
and jar of wind and heavy sea caused the bark
earn of the water as It came in. but as soon
as the cargo is discharged the Besse will be
given a thorough overhauling.

Birthmark Came Late in Life.
The other day a well-known rounder,
somewhat the worse for a discolored eye,
walked into a downtown barroom, where
he met a number of his friends, says the
Milwaukee Sentinel.
"Hello, Jim." exclaimed one of the men
at the bar. "what's the matter with your
eye? Been getting into trouble?"
"Oh, no," replied the-, man; "that's a
birthmark." '
"A birthmark!" said the first sneaker In
nurprlne, "you did not hnvÂ« It a few days
ago. How do you nrcpunt for a birth
mark npnoarlnj? at. this time of life?"
"Well," answered Jim by the way of ex
planation. "It's like thin: You boo. I went
down to Chioniro on tlio boat the other day
n$d on the way back I got into thq wrong
berth. "\

Court street, Cincinnati, was recently the
victim of a pecuIlapSaccident, according
to the Post of that city. Miss Broadbeck
had been to a social gathering, returning
to her home at 11 o'clock at night. She
prepared for bed, and sat , for a time be
fore the grate firÂ© in hey, room, as was
her.. custom. The young lady had an ex
ceptionally, heavy suit ; of - 'raven-black
hair.', It was necessary, for- her .'to .do it
up in a cloth when going to bed. She wpre"
two large celluloid combs inher hair, and
these were under the cloth when she made
preparations to retire and was' sitting in
front of the fire. She Jeaned over quite
close to the grate and the heat: caused' the
combustion of the celluloid' combs.'. -The
cloth around her hair Ignited, -and this set
lire to her hair. The whole top 1 of ; her
head was a mass of flames and she ."ran
screaming from .the house. 1 She snatched
with her | hands at , her., hair and i. pulled
bunches of It from her head and used, her
hands in other ways to extinguish .the
flames. She was successful in putting'out
the fire.- but not until she had almost com
pletely been bereft of the beautiful ""crown
of glory" which had been such'a'distin
guishing' mark. Â¦ There was-oneMong I tuft
on the back of the head, but aside from
this, the other hair was I'all burned off
short. < The young lady's hands were in a
terrible condition from .contact with - the
flames in her hair. Her scalp was burned
to some. extent, but the chief pain came
from the burning her hands received.
The final decision In thÂ« matter of these, com
missions miikp.Â« such an expedient no longer
possible. And,' although ' every effort ! will - be
exerted by me to collect this tax In full,, the
business of this office has so enlarged* that' m>

tax collections on -eighteen trillion dollars of
property. The Increased collfctlons last year
amounted -to, over $34,000; almost this entire
amount being collected from Chinese and Jap
anese - alone. ' To secure this several of my.
deputies^ worked overtime, beginning 'at 4 or
6 o'clock a.- m. and often extending their ' ef
forts Â¦ to midnight. The migratory â¢ habits I of
the Chinese and Japanese and the arrival and

I had no authority to require such deputies
