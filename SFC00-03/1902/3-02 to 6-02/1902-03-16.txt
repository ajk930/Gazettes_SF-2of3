.Suppose you want to teach a dog -' to
walk on his hind feet. You take him by
the paws, then one paw, giving your com
mand, "stand up," all. the while, .till fin
ally he learns to walk. The first week
I hold his paw; the next I give him my
cane as a support, helping him as little
as possible, and so on, till at the com
mand he will walk.
In training a dog to walk upon 'his
front. feet take him by hia hind legs and
walk him about "wheelbarrow" fashion.
Then take a small cane, place it
under his hind legs and slightly
lift them up so that the weight
will be thrown on the front feej.
Then tap the hind legs slightly with the
cane, and the dog will soon learn what
you want him to do, and he , will do It.
Remember, a > dog or a ' horse j is always
glad to please you, after ho understands
what is wanted.
Should you want the dog to walk on
three legs tap gently the particular' leg
you want off the floor. -Th dog will'soon
w.alk on three legs. Should you . want
him to walk upon two feet on the same
side of the body follow the sa,..e rule.
Should you ; want him to walk' on the
right front foot and the left hmd foot the ;
same method may be followed.
To teach a dog to turn a back I somer
sault make a small belt with a rope at
tached.to ether ' side. Place; v the strap
around the body near the front legs. Then
lift the dog up by the strings and turn
him over. This will have to be repeated
dally for at least three weeks.: The dbg
will soon have confidence in his own,abil
ity and will turn of his own accord. Eve -y
time you turn the dog over in . training
him in this act give him some "cue" 1 or:

f -, O txÂ» * successful animal trainer
I one must study animals as one
I studies, people. The varieties of
I dispositions are quite similarâ
-* some are mild and some are fierce;
some bright and some stupid. Some ani
mals show criminal tendencies Just as
some children do. Some are wrongdoers
from intention. They know the difference
between nght and wrong, but they delib
erately choose the wrong. Such animals
should be dealt with aa criminal*, but be
sure In choosing; your treatment that 'you
do not confound the merely stupid creat
rre with tbe criminal.
If one will give a little time and atten
tion, he will find this a most interesting
physiological study. Take young puppies
for the first example. A puppy who is
merely mischievous will never sneak up
10 you bearing the photograph of his
guilt in his hanging head and crouching
gait. If he has stolen some article for a
plaything he will probably bring the rem
nants to you in triumph and be much
chagrined at your disapproval. On the
other hand, the pup who is naturally a
thief bears his treasure away into some
peaaeaaifl of any â¢peetal qaaHfleatbra.
The whole eclenc* of training animals re
solves Itself into one thingâ that la work,
and hard work at that. , Of course, one
must be kind, patient and persevering.
It la very slow work at first and one can
not see much advancement In any animal
that is being trained in the first tew. days,
sometimes weeks. But if the trainer con
tinue* the results will. In most cases, be
satisfactory. If I had & son bent upon
becoming an animal trainer and he came
to m* for adTlo*, X would advla* him not
to enter the business, but should he in
sist. I would set down the following aim
pie rules for him to follow:
Firstâ Use common horse sense and do
not expect to accomplish In a. day work
that will require weeks. . . - Â¦ Â¦ - â¢
Secondâ Never punish an animal for the
sake of wearing out a whip. Remember,
the most contemptible thing that walks
the earth is the Individual that punishes
dumb creatures unnecessarily.
Thirdâ When an animal doeo anything
particularly well, show your appreciation
by a kind word, a stroke or caress, and
occasionally reward him with a small par-
X>eca moat hm treated rvrr hkkA Me*
childreu. They know when they axe dis
obedient, and have naughty spells, just
as- children do, and have w be punished.
But the best way to train dogs Is by
kindness. Some trainers do it by whip
ping:, as It la a quicker way. but the ani
mals are not as reliable If trained In this
way and are apt to go back Von their
master in critical moments. ; 'Â¦.
The way to get the best result* is to
make the do*-* think what their ar* doing
Is fun, and If the. trainer oan keep them
thinking so his success is assured. Never
let your anger get the best of you. Never
beat your dog. That will make him stu
pid. Occasionally, if they are disobedient,
I have to chastise them a lltt*e, out they
always know what It is for.
I believe the dog'is more intelligent
than people give him credit for being, and
will do anything in his power if you treat
him right. You must first make him
understand that you are master. Then
he must learn his name and to come
when he is called. It will take from two
to five weeks to do this well. Then you
will teach him to jump over a stick and
find tfcta Â«m of titf aiiaÂ«maUÂ» things
with I which you will have to contend.
Much has 'been written about the re
markable memory of | elephants. ' These
articles may be written by profound
thinkers, but' not by practical animal
trainers, s Mr, experience with elephants
has been \ long and varied, and I find
them invariably treacherous, irresponsible
and as to memory I find that good, bad
and indifferent. In fact, elephants are
like i their fellow. animals, whether of a
higher or lower order. Moat of â¢nr ele
phants are - young, but , even at an early
age I find, their; natural' propensities ' as
serting themselves. ; They are willful' and
show signs of treachery. They axe' rea
sonably Intelligent, but : do not show
near the amount* of gray matter displayed
by^a dog or a horse. It baa been gener
ally conceded among animal trainers and
showmen; in general that camels were
useless/ except for menagerie purposes. It
has been claimed that j the , camel pos
sesses no more bra'n than an ostrich. This
has also been said of the zebra.Â¦Â¦..Â¦Never
theless', I have made a study of; th^e
two species, and, strange as Jt may'seera.
tf$7/tf HO has not at one time inhis
vJAJ/ life tried to teach - hia Pet dog
\^Vj Â« * few simple tricksâ and
generally failed miserably? You fail
simply because you do not know how.
In tlays : gon,e by it was considered a
.great' thing when a dog could be
taught to "sit up," to stand on his
liind leg^, to jump through a hoop,
and a few other simple.performanccs.
Now all this work is merely a small
preliminary in the eyes of a profes
sional animal trainer. Some men
have taken the trouble to make a
. business of such training and they
"know how." Mr. C. J. Morris of .
"Norri* & Howe's Trained Animal
Show" gives below an article on ani
mal training prepared especially for
the readers of The Call, Mr. Norris
started out first merely with the idea
! of training- dogs, but he gradually en
larged the field of his efforts to tak*
in camels, zebras and even seals. Ho
saya that he has been able to do a
little in the line of teaching pug doga
and goats â but a very little. This
may prove discouraging to the fair
sex who own. some little pugs that
they t>nâ¢v "just the smartest tilings
in all the world." Other dogs are not '
on the tabooed list, however, and
when you know how to train them it
Â¦ is. the simplest thing in the world to
take any pup .of evident brightness
arid turn him into an acrobatic won
der. The methods as Mr. Norris ex
plains them are so interesting that
even a person who doeo not anticipate
putting some horse, dog or possibly
oven zebra, lion or seal, through a
course of educational training, cannot
fail to enjoy reading what he has to
say on the subject. .*

Evidences of Prehistoric Civilization in Wilds of Alaska.

lÂ» Last summer miners working on

trict, found several coffer dams a consid-
erable distance , below the surface and
resting on" bedrock, while on Kougarok
Creek a bedrock drain BOO feet j In . length

string of wooden beads was also found,
the beads being strung on iron wire. They
were in a state of petrifaction and have
been . sent to the Smithsonian Institution.
. These discoveries caused considerable
comment, and the miners are firm in the
belief that many centuries ago that sec
tion of Alaska was -' the scene of active
scriptlon of her gowns to be published.
"Oh, no, indeed, I could not do that,"
she responded. . Â¦ - "
"No, - Mrs. Depew has the same horror
of giving out for publication purely .per
sonal matters," added the Senator, "that
all ,, women brought up abroad have. It
is something born and bred In them, and
not to be overcome at short notice."
"Knowing that aversion," I said, "1
wondered to see a description of your
gowns In one of the New York Journals."
"Thai ls easily, explained," said Mrs.
Depew. "I find thaÂ£ in this country when

What Etiquette Demanded When
Prince Henry Went Overboard
gY profession .Prince Henry of
Prussia is a diplomat and a sailor,
says the Brooklyn Eagle. Offi
cially he is the commander of the
German - squadron in the Pacific,
and his title ls that of admiral. And be
It known, also, in the Interest of this an
ecdote, that discipline ls as strict In the
German navy as it is in the Emperor's
army.
. It happened one day during a rather
nasty storm at sea that a sailor fell
overboard from the flagship. â¢'.'. Prince
Henry chanced to- be the only person
who saw . the man fall, and without
waiting to think of his dignity or his
general importance to the German na
tion : and "- navy, the Prince dived over
board,-intent on saving the sailor.
The people who had . not seen the fall
of the sailor were not so remiss In
the matter of a Prince and an admiral.
All of Prince Henry's officers who came
on deck promptly dived after their ad
miral, intent upon the preservation of the
Princex and of native tradition together.
The Prince, who had caught the
drowning sailor by diving for him,
came to the surface to find himself sur
rounded by nearly his whole staff, all
of whom saluted as well as they could
under the- circumstances, .for two of
them were most indifferent; swimmers.
Meanwhile, aboard the flagship there
was .consternation. At one sweep the
ship I had .'apparently been- deprived of
all Its executive 'officers except two,
who were below fn their cabins, asleep.
Mindful only of discipline and oblivious
to' the needs of -the men in the water,
a signalman rushed below and pounded
excitedly on the door of one officer's
cabin. .
."Herr Lieutenant!" he shouted, "the
Herr Prince Admiral is in the sea, the
Â¦ Herr Commandant has gone with him.
The Herr Commodore and two. Herr Cap^
tains are also overboard. There are
also others. What are the orders of
the Herr- Lieutenant?" -Â¦Â¦-Â¦â¢ ;
"Throw them a rope, you blazing Idiot!*'
howled the lieutenant, hurrying Into his
clothes and racing to the deck.
The sight which greeted him is said to
have been inspiring. A rope had just been
thrown to the swimming and spluttering
.officers, but none of them would taks It
until after the Princeâ etiquette forbadeâ
and he was too far away to reach . it.
There waa really ydanger of a tragedy,
when the Prince, who ia a powerful swim
mer, perceived and understood the diffi
culty. For the first time. It ls said, he
lost his temper In most royal fashion and
savagely ordered the nearest man to grab
the rope. The officer addressed tried to
salute respectfully, but as he waa already
half-drowned and was utterly unable to
swim at all with only one hand, the at
tempt merely sent him under the water.
Then the Prince spokeâ spoks emphatic
ally, and continued to speak as his officer*
caught the line and hung on to It. one be
hind the other, like a string of trout. Tba
admiral Prince was still speaking when
he was hoisted respectfuly aboard, an*
It ls said that his Impromptu address con
tinued for some little time afterward.
Mark Twain has complained of the Inef
ficiency' of the German language in
xnoments like these, but the Prince got
along. The speech was never fully report
ed, but, the closing remarks were under
stood to have contained this historic or
der, delivered to the signal man:
" , and the next time a man
falls overboard you heave him a hyphen
ated rope before you call any qualified
officer; and then, if the double-dashed
asterisk doesn't know enough to catch
why, let him swim!"
Nevertheless, the good-tempered Prince
was himself the first to laugh over the
circumstances a few minute3 later and to
good humoredly chaff his officers for fol
lowing him into the water. Moreover, he
bo forgot his former experience and Its
orders that a little while afterward ha
again jumped into the 'sea to rescue a
sailor who had been stunned as he went
overboard.
Thinking of this exquisite gown 1 asked
Mrs. Depew if she had allowed any de-
On this occasion she 'was superbly
gowned. Mrs. Depew is quite tall, and
rather slender, and the rich folds of the
dress hung in most graceful curves.. The
material was of liberty satin, grayish
white in color, the^olds shimmering with
a silver light. A - wide band of point lace,
fully a foot and a half in width, was in
serted a few inches from the hem. Ac
cessories of the lace were used as well
upon the bodice, which was also trimmed
in silver, a delicate pattern being traced
in silver paillettes. The same delicate
tracery was used around the hem of the
gown.
. She stood Just at the entrance of the
yellow reception-room and greeted each
and all with that same quiet dignity in
her bearing and a genuine cordiality and
sweetness that one felt instinctively. From
the moment she took your hand in hers
and addressed a few words of welcome to
you you felt she had in some mysterious
way made you her friend. Her face is
very tranquil fn repose, but when she
speaks it lights up with such a kindly
spiritâ gentle, yet firm, a face full of
character. /
"That is not so difficult as it seems,"
observed the Senator. And turning to his
wife he added, gallantly, "Mrs. Depew
has that happy faculty of remembenng
faces and namesâ a boon to be thanklul
for."
I attended one of Mrs. Depew.'s at
homes one Thursday, "Senator's day,"
and the spacious mansion was thronged
with people come to pay their respects to
the wife of the genial Senator from New
York and to see this bride, who has been
the talk of two continents. Of course the
position was a trying one for her, as all
will admit. The most critical, however,
could find not the slightest fault to cavil
over.
"Yes, the coming to Washington alone
immediately after our arrival in this
country was rather trying, but every one
was so kind they made me feel as mucn
at home as I could under the circum
stances. I thought I had met every one In
Washington, there were so many at Miss
Paulding's tea. It was delightful, but my
head whirled at the mere thought of re
membcrir.g all the faces, to say nothing
of the names."
"It is too early yet to say whether I
shall get to Paris this year," .- said she,
"but I shall go back and forth to New
York often with Mr. Depew, although 1
regard myself as settled here. I am con
stantly meeting more people â the circie is
always widening. : . . â¢ Â¦â¢' .
Charmed as she is with Washington,
and what she has already seen of it, Mrs.
Depew expects to visit Paris again. It is
possible she may return ntxt summer, al
though that depends largely upon the du
ration of the session of Congress.
"Oh, Washington society is delightful."
exclaimed the Senator. "I never was ;n
a place where the social glass was so sa!-<.
Either there are no stones to throw -or
there are poor throwers, or every one is
having such a good time they, do not care
to throw. No doubt there are as many
sinners here as elsewhere, but they aie
such charming sinners."
"With so many social duties I will have
no time with my music, I ftar. I do not
wish to have it appear th'at I am un
grateful for all the hospitality lavished
upon me. Far from it. The cord.ality
makes a great impression on me. It is de
lightful to come back to one's native land
and be so received. 1 have never known
anything like it."
"Do I ride? Not at all. No, my partic
ular hobby, if hobby I have, is music. I
can wax enthusiastic on that subject, for
I am very fond of it in both its branches,
vocal and instrumental. .Lately I have
been unable to do anything with either,
and I am sorry to say the outlook In that
regard is not promising.
"What do I think of her?" she said, re
peating my question. "Oh, delightful, but
so energetic, so athletic. The we nun
seem to . do all the things the men do.
They ride, play golf and tennis, hunt and
do all those things. I do not care for out
door life myself, there is too much work
about such sports. And the club at Chevy
Chase, which, they tell me, is most de
lightful, alas, does not appeal to me ii
the least.
There is a quiet dignity about Mrs. De
pew which is one 'of her chief charms,
and it seems to be a natural accompani
ment to the polish that is so quickly no
ticed when one converses with her. She*
has no affectations, and it was with a*
pleasing sincerity that she discussed the
American woman on her native heathy
"Washington is something like Paris ia
that respect," remarked Mrs. Depew, lu
her soft, well modulated voice, "and yet
it is different, too. There there is no
political element." ' ?
"In New York it is so different; there la
such a sameness about the social life. So
ciety hives by itself. Society is separate
f.rom literature. Society is separate from
Bohemia. Society, is- separate from the
life of the Judges, the preachers, the phy
sicians and the politicians. But in Wash
ington all is different. A clever, ambi
tious man from the West or the South
or the New England States can come
here, and if he has it in him can be in so
ciety and hold his own.

"Precedence! How can there be any pre
cedence? Every one's position socially Ls'
fixed for him. Either one is a diplomat,
or in the Cabinet, or has some social.po
sition; and that is jus: what makes Wash
ington so delightful. There is always
some element of interest in the social,

"Not very well," I replied; '.'but that re

my mother, who, by the way, was a
Southern woman, and I have spent all my
life in Europe, mostly in Paris. I never
forgot, however, that I was an American.
All my studies were along American lines,
and before me has always been the 'fixed
purpose of coming to see my native land.
I have bc-en a long time In doing It. but
at last I am here. Yes, It was strange
that my family never came back to Amer

all my life to come to America, and
especially to the capital. I have always
had such great expectations of Washing
ton, and they are every one realized and
more than realized.
"What are' my Impressions of Washing
ton T' asked Mrs. Depew.
"How I Found Washington."
The first the world heard of Mrs. DeÂ«
pew was that she was a mere slip of a
girl and that the wedding was one of
the May and December affairs. Next it
was told that the bride was no girl, but
a woman perceptibly gray. Mrs. Depew
is a woman in the prime of life, neither
middle aged nor very young, but just the
proper age for the mistress of Corcoran
house. Her hair is not gray, but brown.
Her eyes are large and a soft brown and
her teeth are white and even.
in Paiis. where she has spent nearly
nil of her life, the esthetic in most things
is 'developed to the highest degree; yet
Mrs. .Depew is genuinely enthusiastic over
the American jzapital, which is a mere
babe in comparison vrith the gay French
metropolis, wliere so much of the world's
history Has "iteen made.
To ascertain her impressions of Wash
ington i cknea at the Corcoran house and
found heir fulsome in her admiration of
her new- environs and associations!
But Usere is one striking point of dif
ferences between Mrs. Depew and the
averag^ American woman â she has no
taste for outdoor life. Hiding and driving
and the more violent goif and tennis hold
forth no inducement to her and her no
tions of. this phase of the strenuous Amer
ican fen*inine character are decided.
Mrs. I>epew and the Senator received
me in tfcÂ« library, overlooking the "retty
park, which will soon be radiant and gor
geous with spring .blossoms. -The wife of
the SeJiator was' dressed in a becoming
blouse of white taffeta, stitched with
black and narrow pipings of turquoise
velvet, the collar b.e.ing.of blue, with black
stitchings, giving it a very chic appear
ance. Her skirt was black. She wore
no jewels except her wedding ring, a
circlet with a large diamond flanked up
on each side by a sapphire.
It teems fitting that such a place as
this thouid be the home of a woman
bi ought up in the Old World, with its
Ucie- honored traditions and historic as
sociations, instead of one of the brand
new tyicii. and span mansions, which are
so numerous in Washington.
Enthusiastic in New Home.
In the commodious garden which runs
back irom H street. Lord Lytton, then
an attache of the legation, under the
pseudonym of "Owen Meredith," wrote
"Lucile." One can easily fancy this gar
den is the cne described in the poem where
Lucile and her lover meet after a lapse
ol years.
There the late Calvin S. Brice and Mrs.
Brice dazzled the capital with their splen

a Senator from Ohio. Forty years ago it
was occupied by its owner, W. W. Cor
coran, whose sympathies were with the
South when the war came on and who
discreetly leased it to Great Britain for
use as a legation in order to save it from
coniiscaiion by the Federal Government.
Society is pleased with Mrs. Depew. The
Senator's wife is already fond of Wash
ington.
Right in the heart of society's domain

she is confident she has judged unbiasedly.

so much on the qui vive for innovations
and acquisitions, and the welcome it gave
her has found its response In her appre

Gossips, whether men or women,
do more harm in a month than one can

often "I did not mean anything," when

. , "That's it," she said In delight. "Now,
what is that little square thing with a
round hole in the middle called? The
f thing that stops a screw?" .'
The hardware .man returned with a nut.
So the purchasing went on." Mrs, Van
Pelt returned home with a shopping bag
* full of hardware. She took it off to her
own private corner of the house and went
to work. Â¦
The work was very slow and the fail
ures were many, and In the end, or
rather, long before the , end, the family
found out what she was doing. She had
to fate a torrent of questioning then and
no- end : . of "jollying," but she smiled in
the consented little way that she has, for
she always believed .that it Is effort
wasted to be angry. She kept ori with her
hammering and screwing and fitting.
Days and 'days and days went by be
fore she could see light ahead. The tools
perplexed her. The parts of a mechanism
were Greek to her.
She simply kept on. She learned what'
â¢ ! securing pins ] are and the use of them.
Ehe learned , spindles and tumblers and
latchbolts. Gradually the lock began to
shape Itself. .
Then came that tantalizing, period when
the Inventor suffers all the fine tortures
of the will-o'-the-wisp's victim. Every
laughed at her. He said the thing could
A second one showed less sense of hu
mor, but he firmly refused to undertake
an impossibility.
Then she went to work to make the
model herself. She proved that It could
be done. Her box was a success.
She sent it off express haste to Wash
ington and, after all the delays that the
model makers had caused, it arrived just
one day after the competition closed.
That Is not the end of the story,
though.
She put away the box and kept it seven
years. Then it came of use, to prove that
the proverb knows what it is talking
abotft.
Seven years after the time that it was
completed, when she had almost forgot
ten it, a letter came to her. This letter
was from a Philadelphia firm. The firm
explained that they had applied for a let
ter box patent and found that it infringed
upon one taken out by Mrs. Ada Van Pelt
of Oakland. Would Mrs. Van Pelt join
forces with them or sell them her rights?
The box had found its use at last.
She sold it to the firm for a rousing
good price and they have combined its
advantages with those of their own.
The crew of the Oakland ferryboats
know her. Where the sign "No admit
tance" frowns from the door of the en
gine-room she is privileged to pass. She
spends hours in that room, studying the
wonderful machinery to which are en
trusted all the thousands of lives that
the boats carry daily. The engineers and
all the assistants know her, and they are
always delighted when they see her com
ing and they are ready and willing to an
swer all her questions and explain to her
every part of the machinery. '
"It'Si*ecause she doesn't ask fool ques
tions like most women," one of them
said. "Not but that she's womanlyâ why.
she's a lady, she laâ but she knows about
things some way and she asks questions
that show that, like a man would."
In time it came about that she invented
a device to take the* place of steam In the
engine. It has been tested on small boats
with success.
Her oil burner Is the newest toy that
she has built and consequently it is her
greatest interest at present: Its comple

flaming to the .family and cried joyfully,
"It burns. It burns!"â was just ten months
from the time when she had begun work
on It. During that time she had worked
days and nightsâ far Into the night some
times. Her workshop often showed a light
from her midnight oil until 2 or 3 o'clock
in the morning. She had experimented
over and over again with the ventilator
in her efforts to ascertain the correct
number of hole's for itâ one too many or
one too few ruined it. The spreader was
slow in being perfected. Her wagon was
hitched to a star and It was hard getting
near the star. She had set out to produce
an oil heater that had neither odor, smoke
nor noise; one that should consume less oil
than any other, because of complete com
bustion and one that should be clogged by
no formation of carbon. It was not a par
ticularly modest ambition.
According to the story of her heater it
does not pay to be honest. She was bump
tiously ambitious and she has finished her
work with the result that a Standard Oil
expert tells her that she has succeeded.
Mrs. Van Pelt has not spent twenty
years of her life at invention without hav
ing the perpetual motion bee in her bon
net. Once she almost accomplished her
end. like all the rest of them, but when
she found that she could get no nearer
than almost she gave up with much grace
and more wisdom and set to work at less
ambitious devices.
When she becomes thoroughly absorbed
In the working out of an invention she is
merciless to herself. She works without
eating or sleeping for long stretches; in
fact, she says sho forgets all about these
little matters when she Is thoroughly
absorbed at her work benah.
"And then when I go to my meals I
keep thinking about my scheme all the
time, and when I go to sleep I keep
dreaming about it. Sometimes I dream,
out the very thing that has been puzzling
me through the day. Once the secret
that I was after came to me In a dream
and I awoke and followed out the clew
and completed the device that I was
working: on."
And yet she Is the last woman In the
world that you would call a dreamer.
She is a gentle woman, with silky white
hair and a queenly carriage. She is full
of reserve force; her manner Is extremely
quiet, her energy is all held in the back
ground. She is entirely what the man
In the engine room calls herâ "womanly."
"Some people think it is not exactly
ladylike to work with a hammer and
wrench," she said In the sweetest of
voices. "So I wish that if you are going
to publish a picture of me In" my work
shop you would put along with It another
oneâ Â« picture of me in another costume.
I want it to be a ladylike costume."
So Mrs. Van Pelt of the canvas apron
transformed herself into Mrs. Van Pelt
of the splendid silk robe and the two of
her are on this page, side by side. But I
defy any observer to discover which one
la not "ladylike."
morning she awoke with a new hope,
founded on a new Idea. By night she had
found a flaw in the scheme and had to
throw it away and begin all over next
day. - .
. Just because she kept on where the
other nine hundred and ninety-nine would
have given up, she succeeded. In the end
BhV showed her family a lock that worked.
It was a combination lock of thirty
thousand changes. And it had only seven
parts.
That is one of her boasts â that her ma
chinery is so simple, it always consists of
Â¦o few, parts. The .wonder of it is not its
complexity, but its simplicity.
On' the proud day that the lock was
found to work it was put on a letter
box and It turned fascinatingly' at the
mystic combination. By the next day the
novelty had worn off "and she was ready
for the next stepâ the patenting of her
device.
It was a triumphant moment when sho
knew that her lock was patented and that
the manufacture of it might commence.
Since that time eight thousand of the
little locks have been put in Government
postoffices within one year. It must be
a very nice sensation to see one's own in
vention attached to letter boxes in every
State in the Union. .
Mrs. Van Pelt would have been less
than human if she had not wanted to in
vent everything that the world needed
after striking twelve the first time. How
ever, the wanting to would have been
enough for some people. It. wasn't for
her. She went about the doing.
Pcstofftce needs naturally attracted her
most, and the invention of two letter
boxes was the result. One was for pri
vate houses and one for large business
houses. The one shown in the picture is
the bigger; as with other mothers and
offspring, her pride is its teeth. She will
explain to you in the most technical of
terms, which she -has acquired since her
first day in the workshop, how these
teeth prevent any one from taking out the
letters after once they have slipped down
to their proper position.
In the making of the other box she
turned loose her feminine love of beauty.
She made it so .pretty a little affair that
nobody could object to it on a front door.
She had It painted with dapper little bor
ders. It worked like a charm.
â¢Not until she had gone through many
tribulations, though. The Inspiration of
the letter-box was an offer made by Wan
amaker when he was Postmaster General.
He saw the need of a perfect house let
ter-box and he made an offer for de
signs. Mrs. Van Pelt set to work.-
She realized that springs are the most
troublesome part of a mechanism, the
part that Is most often out of order. She
determined, therefore, that her box should
have nothing to do with springs. She was
going to make gravity take their place.
When she explained her developed
scheme to a famous model maker hÂ»

"I ] want that ' , thing that you ; screw
with," she said, pointing to one imple
ment, "and I want something .that will
take hold, eo.'V She illustrated with two
fingers " on the edge [ of j the. counter. .'. The
hardware man understood and he depart-
She .hadn't the slightest idea what any
of them were called but she knew what
she wanted to do with 'them. So she
looked around the shop and- picked them
out, and what she . didn't see she asked
for. Â¦ . â¢ . ,
"I can't set my letter because Pveleft
my key In my other pocket-book." â¢
"Dropped my key in the mud and I
can't find it."
"Somebody must have stolen my key.
I never mislay It."
And in the end somebody behind .the
window had to go to the lock box and
get out 'the mail and there had to be a
new key made.
"People ought to be chained to their
letter-box keys," said the postmaster at
heme.
Then his wif*e inquired into the matter
and was told of the chronic trouble.
"There should be a lock without a
key," she said. She said it as she says
everything, in a quiet little way that you
think doesn't mean anything until you
know her.
Her husband laughed casually. "The
thing is to get it," he said. |
She was through discussing the subject
for the time. She believes in doing things
instead of talking about them.
The one thing in her mind at that mo
ment was the idea that she would invent
that lock.
Ehe didn't know the first thing' about
machinery in a technical way. But she"
had observed. She knew something about
locks because she had a good wholesoma
curiosity about the fearfu^l and wonderful
making of useful things. She set herself
to invent a combination that could be
used for so simple and' small a thing as
a letter-box. â¢
She didn't want to tell the family about
her scheme until it was mature, for she
vas pretty sure that they would laugh
at her. So she stole out secretly to a
hardware shop ard laid in a store of
tool*.

A great many of you know Mrs. Ada
Van Pelt, but bow many of you know
that she is a successful inventor? She is
so qu5et about it all that half of her
friends never dream that "Van Pelt's
permutation lock" and "the Vanguard oil
turner" have anything to do with her.
"While all the time they ire owing her
their entire existence.
Twenty years ago she started on her
mechanical career.- For all those twenty
years, in spite of ridicule, id spite of fai-I
ures, in spite of Invalidism, she has stuck
to her determination to be a successful
mechanic. In that time she has taken
out five patents.
It was slnw work from -the start. She
never had so much as one lesson in me
chanics in her life. She had to work our
for herself the use of every tool and
every part of a machine. When she.be
gran she did not know even the names of
the common tools.
She made her first invention In the way
that it is said all good inventions are
made â because she saw a need for a de
vice., not because ehe set out to invent.
Patent people say that the amateur in

"You want a description of Mr. Gibson?
Well, all the name I know him by is the
Rev. J. George Gibson. I couldn't tell you
what color his eyes are, though I have
looked into them many times.
"He has a medium forehead, and the
hair is beginning to leave it, but he is not
what you would call bald. His com
plexion is rather florid, and his hair has
been black, but Is now sprinkled with
gray. He wears a mustache. One hun
dred and eighty-five pounds is what I
wuold write down as his weight. He has
a round face, decorated with a mus
tache. He must be about 5 feet 7
Inches in height, and about 45 years old.
He has several noticeable scars on his
neck, on the left side.
"About his dress? Well, he wears spec
tacles, and I have seen him wear a gold
ring occasionally. He has a gold watch
and chain, but he never displays it. When
he is at home he generally wears a short
coat or Jacket, and on the street a Prince
Albert coat with a soft hat.
"He has hands a little below medium
Bize. They are not big hands, and his
feet are email also.- He uses them well
In a rather stately walk. He walks as
though he thought himself as good as
the Prince of Wales or any one else.
"He Is a Scotchman by birth, though I
think he was raised in London. A strong,
resonant voice, of which he does not use
the full strength in conversation, is one
of his marked characteristics, or physical
features.
"Your first Impression of the man In
meeting would be that he is distant
and reserved in manner, but after know
ing him you do not find him so. He's a
good man all around."

"The Rev. J. George Gibson Is "very
straight, and he has what you might call
a marching walk. He's stout too."â
"Yes." broke in Mrs. .Vogel. ,"he must
Â¦weigh 190 pounds. He has a great way of
running his hand through his hair," she
Â¦went on.â "Well, his hair's auburn or red
riish brown," said Mr. Vogel, "and he's
getting bald, but you wouldn't take him
lor bald; It's Just a little place about the

"I should take him for 40 years old, and
Let me see. he must weigh 190 pounds,
if not more; he's pretty stout. And I've
always noticed that for a man of his size
he has a very small foot. I should not
Judge that he wore more than a 6 or C'i

He has the blue eyes of Scotland, where
he was born. He wears a mustache, and
once in a while he wears eyeglasses. His
face is round and full. . .
"On his neck there are three scars, one
on the left side and two on the right. A
clerical coat, with a turn-down collar is
always part of his dress. He wears one
little ring and a watch and chain.- His
voice is clear and distinct and you can

' "I have been going to Mr. Gibson's
church for nearly Â¦ twenty years, and as
to his name, I am sure that he signs him
self J. George Gibson; what the J: is for
I cannot say. '
"His age? Well, now, that Is a hard
thing to judge about a man, but I should
think he was between 40 and 50 years old,
but I can't tell just where to draw- the
line. I should call him. rather robust than
tall, but he must be 5 feet 7 inches in
height. I have no idea as to his -weight,
but he is pretty solid. I believe he is of
English birth. v
"He has dark blue eyes, and his hair
is auite a dark brown, with no gray as
yet, or at least I have never noticed any.
Baldness is still awaiting him.- He has a
round face with a medium high forehead,
and a very small mouth. In fact, all his
features are small. He has no scars that I
know of. - . Â¦
"For a' man of his size he -has 'very
small hands and feet. His voice is a most
agreeable one, and his bearing is very
erect and dignified. His dress is strictly
clerical always, and the only Jewelry I
ever saw him wear is one plain ring. One
of his most striking characteristics is that
he Is quite reserved in manner. I think
he rather unbends, though when he is
with his class of young men, who are all
very fond of him. His reticence may
have been cultivated, but he Is certainly
quite reserved." ' -

shoulders that are rounding some with !

tinuously since that time. Mrs. Moor*
is the moat prominent member of Em
manuel Church, is president of the Ladles'
Aid Society and from Ions association
with the pastor In his home life and
church work she Is able to give a very
accurate description of the man. .
"Why. I always call him one of my*
boys," said this venerable parishioner Jk
"and I ought to know what he looks Ilk*;
"I should say he's five feet something,
perhaps eisht or nine, and weighs 175. I
don't believe anybody knows his age for
sure, but I think he is about 45.
"He has a pretty round face and his
eyes are kind o' gray and middlln' large
and keen. It's a kind eye, I tell you, and
he wears glasses. I know he has a nose,
' but It Isn't, a nose that would be any
particular attraction. It's Just a nice
looking face, nose and alV There's a
mark on his neck that most everybody
notices.
"His mustache Is a kind o' light color
and his hair's dark. Let's seeâ no, ho
ain't bald. I wouldn't say he's bald, but
there Is a little spot there that you can
hardly see. He parts his hair mostly in
the middle now, just a little to one side.
"He has small feet and small hands
pretty hands, too, they are. I know his
feet are small because he always gives
me his old shoes to glye away to poor
folks and they are small for them.
"He wears a clerical coat and on Sun
day he always wears It buttoned up so
nothing shows but a little of his collar
and cuffs. He wears a standing collar.
"He wears Just a common soft hat â no
plugs and no stiff hats. On the street he
wears a cape overcoat and the cape i3
always thrown back.
"He wears one ring, a plain gold band.
Yes, and he carries a watch on a black
chain he brought from tbe old country. -
The watch is a gold one the church peo
ple gave him. We gave him a gold watch
and chain, but he said he couldn't wear
the chain, for he's very. modest, but he's*
got It all the same.
"His name is John George Gibson. Amer
ican? Oh, no; he's Scotch."
MRS. R. W. MOORE.
"His eyes are light, not black nor blue
say gray. He has a fair complexion,
brown hair with no gray in it, and he is
not bald. He has an open countenance,
with a high forehead, and he does not
wear glasses. On his right cheek or neck
there is a scar. His voice is a fine one
and he has a good large mouth. He is
a. very good singer, and when it comes to
a funeral sermon I think he is as line
a preacher as I ever heard.
"You will always see him in black
clothes and generally a frock coat, with
a kind of a cloak overcoat. I don't think
he wears any Jewelry except perhaps a
small watch chain. He is an Englishman*

"My wife and daughters attend Emman
uel Baptist Church more frequently than
I, and if they were here could give you
a good description of the Rev. George J.
Gibson. I should say myself, that he
weighs 160 pounds, is about- 40 years of
age, and 5 feet 7 inches tall.
JOSEPH STEVENS.
"To begin with, he's short and stout
though I couldn't give it In feet and
pounds. He has light eyes, but I don't
know the color. He's beginning to be
bald, but he combs his hair over the bald
spot so it hardly shows. His mustache Is
dark brown, about the color of his hair.
"I guess he's about 45. When he speaks
his voice is not light, but quite a good
voice; he sings barytone. If you heard
him preach or talk you would see that his
voice Is very expressive., that there is
Â¦much in the way he says a thing.
"He doesn't wear any jewelry at all ex-j
cept a plain gold ring, I think on the lefc
hand. I know he generally takes It off
when he preaches. He wears a watch
too, but you don't see it as a general
thing, for he ke^ps his coat fastened.
"You see I'm not very good at describing
any one. Shall I get his picture to teil
you how he dresses? No? Well ho
dresses like a minister, and always the
s&me, with a white tie, and he wears a
soft hat generally.
"He walks very independently, and I
think he's Scotch, though he lived most
of his time in England. Hla name Is John
George Gibson, but he always signs him
self *J- George Gibson.'
"That's about all, except his hands. I
have always admired his hands. He has
quite a pretty hand, not very big. It isn't
exactly a woman's hand: It is more
strong and capable, but quite as shapely.
And his feet are rather shapely, too I
think.
"If you'd wait till I get his picture. I
could tell you exactly what he looks like
That isn't the idea? Well, then, I'll see

On the side of his neck there is a slight

than that it is ministerial in style and
quiet. He has a fine deep voice and a
consequential walk.

"Well, Mr. Gibson is what I should call

In a little bit of a house set way back
in a yard full of flowers out on Ca-jp
street lives the janitor of the Rev. Mr.
GibsoVs church. He is a bache or, and
as neat a housekeeper as you would find
in a day's journey.
"Well, I've only been here two years,"
he said, "but in all that time I have al
ways found the Rev. J. George Gibson
the same, day in and day out. I think
he is about 40 years old, but he may bÂ«
45. He's deceiving in that respect. He
must weigh about 160 pounds, and he
must be 5 feet 8 inches tall.
"His eyes? Well, I've never noticed
them, but I think they're blue. His hair
is kind of brown, with a little gray, and
he is a very little bald on the t;p of his
head. His face is rather full, and he has
a medium good forehead. His nose is
' medium, but he has a pretty good sized
mouth.
"I have noticed a scar on the s#9e of
his neck, I think on the left, but you
wouldn't notice it at a distance. Oh yes,
he has a mustache and he wears spec
tacles, but only for reading.
"Straight, quick military step, and head
up all the time, is the way he walks.
"He has small hands and feet for a man
of his size. I never saw him wear any
Jewelry but a plain ring on his little
finger, and he never wears that In the
pulpit
"He almost always wears a cape over
coat, and a Prince Albert coat on the
6treet. I think he's English. He has a
good, strong- voice. He's what you'd call
a self-possessed man; he g'oes along and
you'd never think that he noticed any
thing, but he takes it all in."
"He wears eyeglasses once in a while, '

on his third finger, and it may have a.
wnall set in it."
"About his clothes?" said Mr. Vogol;
"he wears always a cierical, closed coat
and a soft hat. He is a line singer and
lias a good barytone voice.* When he
speaks you can hear him in the last seat
in the church. I think he was born in

7 HE Rev. Mr. Gibson's full name and correctly spelled
is John. George Gibson. He is 45 years old, 5 feet 7^2
inches tall and weighs 180 pounds. His eyes are blue.
His hair was a very dark brown, but is slightly sprinkled
with white now. He is not bald, but his hair is getting thin
on top and over the temples. He has a very heavy sandy
mustache. There are y noticeable scars which extend almost
about his throat, but his hands arcfree from them. His face
is round, forehead medium, heavy eyebrows and a slightly re
ceding chin. His dress is that of a clergyman, but different
from the majority in that the frock coat is much longer than
the ordinary. He wears a white pique four-in-hand tie. The
only jewelry that he wears is a watch held in place by a
black bead chain, a tiny King's Daughter cross, and occa
sionally a plain gold ring. His hands are quite small, taking
a jVÂ± glove. His carriage is erect, and he takes short, quick
steps. The peculiarity that would be noticed by a casual ac
quaintance is his English accent, and his glasses uave a very
thick lens. He is a Scotchman, but was reared in England.

ihe Rev. J. G. Gibson as He Really Is.
"He walks very erect, with a heavy
tread, and quick, short step3. He always
wears ministerial dress, with Ions frock
coat. His collar is just the ordinary kind,
but he wears a very broad white tie. | The
most distinctive feature of his dress is
his overcoat, which has a long cape that
comes down to his hands. I suppose
others have told you of this overcoat and
how he always wears the cape thrown
back. Another peculiar to him Is
that he rarely wears gloveg; he nearly
always carries a pair in his hand.
"He wears a black Fedora, size 7%, and
he nearly always wears the same style
shoe, without toe caps; the size, I think.
la 7. He has a small hand and once In a
while he puts on a plain gold ring, but not
often. I have only noticed him wear it
once or twice. He has no other Jewelry,
unless you call a watch jewelry. Hi3
watch chain is of black beads, with a lit
tle silver cross like the cros3 of the King's
Daughters' Society.
"I wouldn't care to say how old Mr.
Gibson is, but he is acotch and his name
Is J. George Gibson."
"His mustache is light brown, tinged
with gray, quite thick and stubby, and
his hair Is dark brown and gray mixed.
There Is a slight tendency to baldness,
but it's hardly noticeable. His hair is In
clined to be curly.
In the same house with Mr. Gibson and
sharing his apartments is Alfred E.
Wolff, the head usher of Emmanuel
Church. The young man Is In very close
touch with Mr. Gibson and this Is the
way he describes his friend:
"He is about 5 feet S and weighs
175. He has a round face and strong chin,
rather square, I think. His neck Is thick;
In fact, he's thickset all over. His nose
Is not prominent; his eyes are blue and
not. very large, and he wears glasses. His
eyebrows are rather dark.
The two girls agreed on his watch with
Its black-beaded chain; also on his hav
ing a medium-sized foot, rather nice
shaped hands and his ability to play the
organ and sins well.
"He always wears the regular costuma
of a minister, with long coat buttoned up
tight In front and always a white four
in-hand piaue tie.
"As to his name," said LJllla, "I only
know it's George, and I think that's all
he's got." /
"And he's English to,- 'the backbone,"
was the smaller one's last Item.
ALFRED E. WOLFF.
"No, his eyes are blue," Ruby corrected.
"A mustache? Yes, I guess he has."
ventured the older sister. "Of course he
has." added the younger, "and his hair la
bushy."
"He -wears glasses."
"He has a round face."
"His nose isn't pointed, but IVn
straight."
"His face always, loolcs pleasant."
Thus far they agre d, and then came a
difference of 'opinion as to which Is hia
ring finger, the third or fourth, with a
final decision on the third finger, the rlns
being a plain heavy gold one.
LiUIe Bennett and her Bister. Ruby, go
regularly to Emmanuel Sunday-school
and they sea Mr. Gibson often, but they
do not agree as to his looks.
"He's about 5 feet 8, I gue3s." said Lil-
He, "and he's quite stout; weighs about
250. I should think."
"Oh. no," protested Ruby, "not that
much, about 190."
"He is dark complected and bald-head

/?=o AN you describe your pastor correctly P There are fev7 people whoso
(( picture should be more strong 1 y impressed upon your memory than
his. In the spiritual and temporal lires of most people their cler
gyman is indissolubly connected with many of the most important hap
penings of their careers. Ee it is who at the altar performed the rites
that made two people happy, and be it is also who speaks for us the last
pad words of farewell to those we love. Surely the mind and memory
should always be able to*recall a perfect image of his personality.
Take our pencil and sit down &nd see how many personal charac

the article below and find how well the congregation of the Emmanuel

people giving these impressions were selected from young and old

of his tribe who thoroughly knows thse

the^e thirty years pince the reservation
was established. Cr.'y a few of the old
people keep it up: the ycur.g ones, even
the middle-aged ones, use our language
among themselves as well as with our
people.

It wa â¢: ascertained that among the

legend of his tribe. From other Yukis

from the old man. then bring it to Berke

Night after night the two worked, at it
up there at the reservation. Moore went
to" the old man's home and listened to
him while he recounted the myth slowly
and laboriously. Over and over his pupil
was only water and mist, thus the earth
was invisible under the water. Things ex

The recording of -
the songs- was very
much of a surprise
to Mr. Moore and a
surprise that did
entirely please
him. He had: never

before, and it evi

an undignified pro

although he rebelled.
- "I didn't come hei e
to talk Â¦Â¦ into no

"I come to teach -Â±9

are; songs that oc

It cussed hard, even when on the fielB, to

"When they were at Round Valley last
fall they came upon this young fellow,
Ralph Moore, and they found that he was
different from the rest. He could talk
English and he likewise would. When
they were hunting relics, which are grow
ing sadly scarce, he helped them out in
their difficulties. They took him into
their confidence, he took them Into his,
and the upshot was that an agreement
was entered into. He was to come to
Berkeley later on to instruct them in the
lore and language of his tribe.
He has come and gone now. and the sci
entists across the bay are patting them
selves on the back and congratulating
themselves that the thing was a thcrough
success. Ralph Moore is likewise patting
himself on the back and rejoicing that
he la back at Round Valley, which he
never left before and never will a sain,

The piece de resistance of the two
weeks' work was the recording of the
creation myth of the Yukis.
It seems that among th* Yuki tribe th*re
remains only one person that knows the
creation mvth of his people. All Indian
repeated it until he had It perfect. Then
lie covered it with his': best- hat, took tho
llendoclno stage and came to the univer
sity. .
Down here he devoted the most of hla
two weeks' time to relating and explain
ing this myth to theÂ» anthropologists.
Much of the Yuki language was recorded
in this way: " â¢. â¢.
It was first' written in the Yuki .. lan
guage as told by the old man. Then it
was translated word for word into Eng
lish. Obscure passages were gone over
and explained. Songs occurred in the
course of* the story' and these were re
corded carefully. The result is that the
Yuki account of the creation is now re
corded in its totality and with nearly ab
solute accuracy. V 'â¢. /
The Yukis call the god who created
them and all other Indians Ty-kah-mul."
At the beginning, the world was all. wat--:
and mist. Just as after the biblical flood,
there was no land. But Ty-koh-mul wa^
in existence. -â¢ ' .. â¢
Firrt he made 'a- little land.. Then from
this he made the whole earth. After this
he made mankind and 'gave the peopfi.'
different languages. That is why no twri
tribe* epeak the samÂ« language.
Ty-kch-mui also made the mountains
sr:d rivers and lakes. He made many
< Ihcr things. At last he went up from
Ihe earth to heaven, where he is now.
This is the Indian story of the creation,
the book of Genesis. It is a long story.
As it was written down from- tho Up.? ol
the narrator it fills a hundred pages of
closely written manuscript.
The Yukis call tho story their Bible.

HAND LOSES ITS CUNNING LONG BE
FORE THE MIND SHOWS AGE.
THE brain of a great man remains in
fine working order long af;er hie
hands, directed by that brain, have
lost their deftness. That is one of
the curious things of life. There are
plenty of instances of mÂ«%i who have
reached the allotted age of life continuing
5n the activities of the world as long as
those activities are of tho brain and not of
the hand. But the mechanic's highest sk'.ll
is shown when he is between the ages of
30 and 40. Afte-r thÂ« latter age the hand
loses its cunning, but if his brain has been
taught to work he can continue to labor
and may even .surpass the earning power
of his hand. After 49 the muscles do not
reEpond nearly as certainly and read
ily to the orders and the willingness of
the brain, and a man's handiwork begins
to fall off la its earning capacity. Yet in
the case of the brain it is only after 40
that it really begins its best workâ the
Work that endures and is called famous
long after the man has ceased to be.
A good instance of the early death of
manual activity is seen in the button
trade. A skillful button-maker in his
prime, between 30 and 40 years of age.
can make $11 or $12 a week, being in ivory
an output each day on his lathe of 6240
buttons. When he gets to be 45 years old
if ho can make $6 or $7 a week he is lucky,
while twenty years later, even if he still
enjoys sound health and faculties, all he
can make is $5 a week. In his trade, of
course, one hand is used principally. In
farming or seafaring, or in some other
vocations in which the energy of the inus- |
cles is distributed' equally over the body,
the physical activity does not dwindle as
soon, and sometimes in these cases of
eq\ml development and use of the muscles
the physical being outlasts the mental,
but these exceptional cases are not those
of mechanics in these daya of .division of
labor.-New York Press.

these in correct form, for they are rarely
known and still more rarely given to
outsiders. They are charms. which the
doctor was wont to use when examining
the patient, to aid him in locating the
disease.
It was a still bigger Achievement to get
tho poison songs on record, for these are
known by almost none of the- tribe and
are held as dark secrets. They are sup
posed to be as potent as the most deadly
pcison in making way with the one at

' The love songs have a fascinating ca
dence. So. too, the hunting songs: they
are sung before starting on a hunt, for
luck. The fishing songs are used in a
similar way before /setting off for a sal
mon killing.
The teaching songs are for the purpose
of giving moral instruction. They teach
kindness, bravery, endurance and the rest
of the virtues.
Moore taught the scientists the use of
the relics which they had gathered with
much labor and have now preserved In
the university museum. They are by no
mums the same sort of Indian articles
that we see In the curio shops; the regu
lation blankets and beads and baskets
are rot prominent - among them. There
are rtre ornaments used in dances and
celel.ru lions â head dresses, feather adorn
ments, decorative ( bands.
The kop kolkut, or feather dress, is used
in the kop wok, which is the gorgeous
fe-ather. dance. It is shaped like an Im
mense cape to be thrown over the shoul
ders. The basis of the thing is a strong
net into which are woven turkey feath-
each bird can furnish only one feather
the labor of gathering material is Ions
and wearisome. j ...
Horns made of Ion? nullla tipped with
ornamental points aro fastened into the
net so that they tower above the head and
flare at both sides Not until these are in
place does the Yuki consider himself in
full evening dress..
Moore illustrated the use of the pack
net. The band attached to it passes over
the forehead, the net with its load hangs
at the back. Th,e making- of the head
l-and is a work of marvelous Ingenuity.
Tiny round, fiat beads are woven into it.
placed so that they will revolve. as the
band rubs against the forehead. This re
lieves the pressure that would come from
a flat surface drarrn tight over the head.
The deerskin blanket thrown over tha
shoulders is the only kind In use by' tho
Yukis. It was a blanket-of-all-work In
the days before the hand-me-downs, ap
peared on the- reservation. Xow.it is rel
egated in the' same way that our-grand
mother's cashmere shawl isâ save that thÂ»
modern Yuki has not enough reverence
to pack it away with mothballs.
Ralph Moore takes an immense prids
in making permanent the lore of his tribe.
But he is very glad that the job la done.
He prefers to brand cattle" and plow his
good native soli. The Yukis . have j ad
vanced a long way in one generation, ! but
they do' not yd take over kindly to an
thropology and .graphophones. .
In Georgia it is estimated that 30,000 ne

QUEER ACTIONS OF BIRDS WHOSE
BRAINS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.
-T is a very common idea that if the
I brain of an animal is completely de
li stroyed it will die. or if it lives It re
main's in a comatose condition. An in
genious German has cut out some p'geona*
brains with care, given the wound time to
heal and shown that the. birds can run
about, fly, measure a distance, eat, go to
sleep in the dark, wake up with the light
and. In fine! do most of the things a
healthy! normal pigeon can do. Only mem
ory and the mating impulses are gone. It
Is possible to^ discriminate very neatly
between the reflex acts and those involv
ing some use of the memory. Thus a
brainless falcon was put in a cage with
some mice. -Every time a mouse moved
the falcon Jumped for it and caught it.
There the act ended. The normal falcon
eats its mouse. When its brain is gone it
pays no moro attention to its captured"
prey as soon as the mouse ceases to move.
These and a great. variety of other ex-
periments on rabbits, dogs, fishes and still
lower orders have shed a deal of light on
the obscure phenomena of "mental" ac
tion. With this have come very material
istic views. *For if the larger p"art of bod
ily actions can be shown to be nothing
more than simple mechanical responses
to appropriate stimuli, the suspicion
grows that the more intricate working of
the' brain is really only the result of %
highly complex arrangement of the same
automatic character. This, is, indeed, the
drift of present-day scientillc opinion; and
this : explains why the reactionaries, of
whom Professor Lombard appears from
the newspaper accounts, to be one, are
driven to- find "reason" in the kick of a
dead fros's leg. For the live frog dem
onstrates his disgust of science In pre
cisely the same fashion, and -this whether
he have a brain to think about it or has
had his thinkirtg apparatus cut out. Those
who are interested in such matters will
find, the latest results summed' up in Dr.
Jacques t.oeb's capital book on tbn...com
parative physiology of the brain. â Har-
songs ,of magic charm. The graphophone
will wheel them off in weird cadences long
after the last Yuki who knows them has
passed away.
Some are dancing songs. They are the
chant3 that the circle of dancers used to
keep up during one.. sometimes two- nights
of revelry. Nowadays the reservation
Indians dance in white man's style
waltzes and two steps that don't permit
you to sirg and that have no thri'l of ex
citement such as the old dances have. A
real Indian dance is a rare dissipation: it
takes place oniji when the agent order3
It for his own or his visitors' amuse
ment. This is usually on one of our holi
days, such as Christmas or the Fourth of
July, when work is laid aside on the
reservation, and the neighboring Con
cowb and Little Lakes join the Yukis in
celebrating.
Then the songs are heard, the same
that Moore has left in the graphophone.
The doctoring songs are very oldâ nun-'
dreds, ' perhaps thousands of years old,
and it was a big achievement to get
ers. They are netted closely so that they
overlap like scales.
The feather dance In which this Is worn
is a dancing match. Prizes are awarded
to the best dancer. ' More than the prizes
is the glory, dear to the vanity of the In
dian heart. But these competitions are
almost never seen nowadays, and most
cf the young Indians do not even know
the correct way of wearing the costumes,
they aro so used to striped shirts and
fedora hats.

what is. among the fashions in lorgnettes.
. Perhaps there is no conceit more oÂ«ld,
certainly none more fashionable, than
what to the untrained eye seems a close
linked chain of silver dotted with dia
monds, emeralds, sapphires or any stone
that glitters and wears big price marks.
We are wont to see these gems conscrt
with gold, although it is the foreign fash-
Ion to set diamonds in silver, which tar-'
nishes directly. But the jeweler that has
a fancy for making the setting for gems
as inconspicuous as possible uses plati
num, which, ounce for ounce. Is worth
less than gold, but In the working comes
to be of greater value because of the
greater difficulty and loss. And platinum
looks very much like sliver.
There are lorgnettes, too, that are Van

only her fingers can find, discloses a wee

ST. PATRICKter with me every night, I stepped. Into
the circle and before either the captain
or ; I myself realized clearly N what was
happening I was not only playing the ac
coinpaniment, but was singing the old
familiar hymns with all the enthusiasm
I used to display in my Sunday-school
class in Sacramento years ago.
. "Instantly I was recognized by the
throng hurrying past on the way to. the
/theater/ and in a few moments a , big, '
curious, crushing crowd had collected.
The street was blockaded, but still I play
ed on as I had never played before the
footlights. -
"In the excitement I whispered to the
little i captain to pass the tambourine for
the usual collection. She did as directed
and such a collection it was. Suddenly
realizing where I' was, however. I hur
ried through the crowd and- off to the
theater.
"The next day the little captain called
, during the matinee and told me that the
collection was not only the largest . ever
taken in the town, but that I had been
made a Salvation Army lassie with all
the. privileges of the barracks, of which
'honor I am exceptionally proua." " Â¦

.. In the line of managerial restraint
every company has Its difficulties, and
.none more so than Richard Mansfield's, if
the folk, geneiaily. are to be
bellevftd. This great actor has the, repu
tation of being severe and exacting to a
despotic degree. His word is law and
."rebellion 01 any sort is absolutely un
heard of; *n his company.
Therr-f ore, to judge from the demure
looking features of Fljrence Smyth, How.
ard Kyle's leading lady, who plays the
part ' of â¢ Alice Adams- In Clyde Fitch's .
revolutionary drama, "Nathan Hale,'' at
the California Theater to-night, one"
would never guess that she had not only
had an Rencounter -with â¢ the autocratic
star, but what is more to the purpose
"had come off victorious.
. The play was- "Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde.". Miss Smyth â¢ had . only two or
.three small speeches, which, though
Mansfield held them to be exceptionally
important, she often rendered in a man- -.
ner peculiarly â¢ her ; own. This invariably
brought forth a severe 'reprimand, for
She has played the part several times
during the past few months on her way
to the coast, and it is said that as a con
trast to her powerful emotional acting
in "La Madeleine," the new play by
Harry Dam of Sacramento, which will be
seen for the first time at the Columbia
Theater to-morrow night, she may jive
an extra matinee of "Romeo and Juliet"
during the single week of her engagement
here.
She plays the masculine part, see says,
not so much to show how pleasing to the
eye she can appear in Romeo's pictur
esque habiliments, but because she be
lieves that the. poetry, the delicacy, the
great tenderness and youthful ardor of
this, the most romantic of all stage lov
ers, can better be portrayed by the subtle
art of a woman than by the more robust
expression of a man. Romeo, she ex
plains, was a mere boy, slender, delicate,
almost fragile, and those who have seen
Mtss Walsh In the play say she is quite
the living embodiment of Shakespeare's
Meal.
It is a role that has always had a pecu
liar fascination for her and there is no
doubt that If she Is given managerial per
mission to present it here her perform
ance will â¢ rival even her sensational act
ing in "La Madeleine." From the pic
ture on this page you can judge for
yourself how nearly she looks the part.
But, nevertheless, it will astonish oven
the most blase theater-goers to learn that
Blanche Walsh has also caught the fever
and has Included "Romeo and Juliet" In
her repertoire for this, her latest West
ern tour, herself playing; the part of the
love-sick swain In Shakespeare's immor
tal tragedy.
Of late It has become quite the fad
among the most famous actresses In Eu
rope and America to play male roles seri
ously. Bernhardt astonished the world
with her acting of Hamlet and L'AIglon.
In the latter role dainty little Mauda
Adams snatched the honors away from
the great Sarah arM made the piece quite
her own. about which the press of two
continents gossiped overmuch.
"You see," she says. "I cannot give up
the stage as my husband wishes me to.
He is a very wealthy man and can give
me everything to make home attractive,
but I have tried it and I hate it. I must
have my. theater and I mu3t have my
applause. I would not give it up for any
man."
"It 4s all nonsense. On what grounds
could. I get a divorce from my husband:
that is what I should like to know? It
may be that he might try to get a divorce
from me on the ground that I won't quit
the stage and go home to him.
It was not generally known thenâ In
fact' it will be a big surprise even now
to tlÂ»e great theater-going public to learn
that Miss Stone in private life is the wife
of Mr. Ledley, one of the richest men
in Toronto, and that the gems she wears
in Cleopatra and all the other Sardou
plays which will be seen during the long
engagement that begins to-morrow night
At the Grand Opera-house were all her
own long before she ever thought of
going on the stage.
And apropos of her ambition for his
trionic fame and the great success sha
has won in her chosen profession, against
the wishes of her. husband, it has more
than once been rumored that she would
Seek a divorce in order to be free to con
tinue on the stage. In answer to all the
stories that have been circulated about
her Miss Stone has said: 1
Next to the surprise that she should
have undertaken to play such heavy
roles at Sardou's heroines with an actor
of such commanding 'physique and dom
inating personality as Melbourne Mac-
Dowel!, Florence Stone's jewels created
the greatest sensation when she appeared
as Cleopatra at the Grand Opera-house.
She was literally ablaze with jewels from
head to foot. There â¢were pendants of
faultless pearls in her ears and ropes of
the same rare gems twined about her
throat, while a heavy girdle of the most
precious stones encircled her waist and
hung almost to the edge of her skirt.
Never before had she been cast for a
part that demanded such lavish display,
and many there were, who, having seen
her only as a downtrodden heroine in
the black alpaca of the domestic plays,
marveled much thereat.
' Perhaps there Is no other profession
that receives more recruits who have
been trained for something else vastly dif
ferent than the stage. Strange as it may
seem the step from the clergy to foot
light favorite is one of the most popular.
In this connection the career of Howard
Kyle, who will appear to-night at the
California Theater as Nathan Hale, is
doubly interesting, for his father, who,
though he was a distinguished veteran
of both the Mexican and the Civil War.
was very religious, and had counted upon
his son becoming a clergyman. Young
Kyle, however, though he had acquiesced
In his father's wishes, had seqretly taken
up the study of. Blackstone, with the am
bition to become a great lawyer. But
just at the time, when he seemed
destined to realize his father's dreams,
and become admitted to the bar at ona
and the same time, he waa impressed
into service as manager for the . local
theatrical entertainments.
During one of these performances in
which he had been induced to take a
leading part he was seen by the late
Margaret Mather, who engaged him at
once for leading parts. His success was
flattering froiri the first and since then
the name of Howard Kyle has been con
spicuous with such companies as Mod
jeska's and the great Warde and James
combination.
the august actor jealously dominate*
every pose and gesture of every member
of his company.
Finally he became so provoked over
what he considered too great a breach
of: her professional prerogatives that, in
taking her to task he pinched her arm
until she almost screamed from the pain.
Instantly all Miss Smyth's Western spirit
flared up. Since earliest childhood, being
an only child, she has always had her
own way. Without a moment's hesita
tion, therefore, she retaliated by seizins
Mr. Mansfield by the throat with one
hand and soundly boxing bis ears with
the other. Then she rushed into her
dressing room, packed her trunks, and
was off to Chicago to join the present
Nathan Hale Company before the aston
ished actor fully realized what had hap
pened.
Jbarn-stor^ning company, for which rea
son my sympathies went out to them and
especially^ to their captain, a sweet-faced
little woman, who appealed to me
strongly from the very nrst moment I saw
her, and invariably I stopped each even
ing on, my way to the : theater to listen
to her singing. She possessed a sweet
voice and, accompanying her singing on
the guitar, rendered the old-fashioned
hymns with sweet simplicity. But it was
pitiful to see their vain attempts to at
tract an audience. Often I was the only
listener, and toward the end of the week
the captain would greet my appearance
with a smile and a nod. N
"On Friday evening, before our engage-
ment closed, I found the band "as usual
on. the street corner, but to my surprise
.the bass drum and the guitar were not
in evidence. On inquiry I learned that
the owner of the hall where the army
held their indoor meetings had attached
their Instruments for non-payment of
rent The little captain was making" a
sorry effort to use the tambourine as an
accompaniment to the hymns, but in the
slang of the stage the meeting was a
'frost.' '"
"In a moment my California blood was
aroused. The little" captain had suddenly
become like an old friend. I hesitated for
only a moment and then quickly unstrap

WHILE you are laughing at the
actor making 'Tunny faces'
for your amusement in the
full glare of the calcium light,
did you ever stop to think
xvhat "funny faces" you are making in
the glare or the same calcium light for
the amusement of the actor who is amus

fairs oft-times comes near to being dis
astrous for the performer, especially thooi
who. like Fanny Rice, depend upon their
absolute seriousness to make their witti

in her dressing-room at the Orpheum

not realize that their voices are as audible
to me as mine is to them, and frequently,
when I am playing, singing and dancing
dolls, I catch such remarks as thes*:
â¢That ain't at ail. It's a face and
body that she works with springs,' while
another insists that the weird effects are
produced with mirrors and a host of ac
complices.
"These are the people *who enjoy every

are the people to whom I play, but you
can't know how hard it is to keep from
laughing at them for their laughter unt:l

thing to know th' la-aw."
Fortunately, however, these remarks were
not made in the . hearing of the court, and
Policeman Flynn returned to his beat. Natur
' ally, his troubles were not lessened by his at
tempts to secure a conviction, for the gang
became bolder and more demonstrative than
ever. But the policeman patiently awaited hlb
opportunity, and before long he had the same
two in custody again, with what he believed to
be a gcod case against them.
"'T was like this," he explained in court
the following day: "Th' door Iv th' groe'ry
Is open an' th' two pris'ners Is r-runnin'
awa-ay. I follies thim an' . sh tumbles over a
ham. which they dr-ropped." '
"Did you see them drop It?" asked the boys'
lawyer.
"Iv c'oorse not," answered Policeman Flynn,
"but, 't is not to be . sup-posed " th* ham
wa-alked-down the alley be ltsilf. They's a lot
iv fruit, too. leadln' all th' wa-ay to where th'
byes Is r-rounded up, an" they ha-ave a pocket-"
ful Iv cha-ange t^ken from th' till." â¢
"How do you know it was taken from the
till?" demanded the lawyer.
"Because 't is not Jn th" till now," replied
Policeman Flynn.
"Oh, well," said the Judge at the conclu
sion of the hearing, "there is nothing to show
/ that they are the ones who dropped the ham -
and the fruit, and they give a plausible ex- '
planation of the possession of so much small
change. The evidence is putely circumstantial, .
and to send them ui> would" be only to utait
them on the downward path. I'll give them
another chance."
"Sta-art thim down l* ,sindin' thim-iup," '
muttered Policeman Flynn to himself, as he
left the courtroom. âOho! "t Is a hum'roua .
mi-an th' Judge Is. 'T id a sha-ame he's not
edilin' a comic pa-aper. It is that. Sta-art
thim: Why, 't Is thim same la-ads Uiafs r-ri<l
ing a tandem bi-sickle on th' down'ard pa-ath
now with th' lw-rake br-rcke."
That Might, as usual, he told his troubles to
his wife, but he got little sympathy from her.
"If yt're an Injane-yus ma-an," the said, -''
"ye'll land thim fellies with th' Â« goods on'

(r.ough on th' foorce f'r to know it. Don't

wa-ants. an' 't Is Tr you to give it to him!"
Policpman Flynn thook his head with the
doleful air of a â¢ man who thought the . whole
world was against him; but he always shows
best in adversity. In. his own language, he

Literary Notes.
*7* jr n. FLOWER deserves a vote of
I \ / ! Panics from' every one who Is
I y I fortunate enough to nave the
' V. "* I opportifnity of enjoying^ his
. X book, "Policeman Flynn." A
good laugh is better than a good cry any
dayâ opinions from some members of the
fair sex to the contrary notwithstanding
âand the reader who is so lacking in ap
preciation as not to enjoy the keen humor
In these sketches is indeed fairly on the
road to mental perdition. VV'r.T
"Policeman Flynn" is a series of
sketches relating- the troubles of an offi
cer of the law in a great city. Each chap
ter is really complete in itself, but taken
all together they run through the gamut
of all possible happenings in the career
of a patrolman. Flynn Is a character
that wins his way into your heart at
orce. He possesses a fund of g'ood na
ture, natural humor, shrewdness and per
tinacity hard to equal and most enter
taining. Mrs. Flynn and Terry, the son.
are equally delightful. The original oi
the character Flynn was a Chicago po
liceman (now dead), and It is said that
some of the adventures were actual oc
currences.
Flynn is a patrolman out and out and
any change that his superiors try to maks
for his personal advantage are always for
the worse. He is promoted to Â«.ue rank ol
sergeant, but soon asks to be reduced to
the racks because there is no work to do
and because every man that he likes has
to treat him with "ray-splct."
Since he will have none of the honors
in advanced rank, he is given the posi
tion of doorkeeper for the Mayor.' "bu;
tbis, too,- proves to be a mistaken step,
and Flynn is not In his element again un
til he finds himself back on his old beat.
As guardian of the Mayor he inadver
â¢ tently gets himself and the chief execu
tive into all kinds of trouble. At hom^
he gives Mrs. Flynn all the details of hit
difllculties in his own inimitable way:
" '1 wa-ait to see his nibs,' says th' politi
cian to me, doin* th' rush act an' thryin' to gc
" 'I'll hsve ye-Â«>r ba-adge.' says he. 'MÂ«
cousin wae a schoolmate iv his nibs, an' 1 do bÂ«
. brlngla' him new? he' I! be c la-ad to ha-ave.
Te'l! eee him la-all on me neck th' minute he
eees me.'
"So I lets the gazabo in, but does his nibs
fa-Bll on his neck? Oho! well, if he does, it dc
be with an ax. an' me own neck feels th' whin
Iv th* wind."
"Ser-rves ye right." commented Mrs. Flynn.
"Te have no elnee at all. Barney. 'Tls ye-er
Juty to do what ye're told an' 1'ave others to
do th' thlnkln".'"
"Listen to that, now!" exclaimed FoMeenyn
Flynn. "Oho", but ye-re a sma-art woman.
That's what his nibs says to me. 'Do as ye're
told. Barney.' he saye. 'an' l'ave me to do th
thinkin' f r th' office. That ma-an c'u'dn't get

too."
"Take him at his wor-rd, anyhow," advised
MrE. Fljnn.

Elliott Flower received most of hte
early training as a writer on the Chicago
daily papers. From the first he 'showed
a strong tendency toward the writing of
humor. - In 1893 he joined the staff, of tho
Chicago Evening Post as a paragrapher
arid later had an editorial page column of
his own In which to exploit his fanciful
ideas. Her held -this position until the'
paper changed hands ( in 1901,, and then
devoted himself to miscellaneous writing
A. new magazine has recently made its
appearance in Boston that deserves more
than passing mention. It is called "Ama
teur Work," and is intended as an aid
for boys who have. any liking at all for
industrial work. We have the January
and February numbers before us and find
much to commend. Tne contents of the
January number include -Studies in EIsc
tricity," "A Steam Automobile," "A
Plate Rack," "An Iceboat," "First Cam
era Work," "Mechanical Drawing:." "A
Boy's Bed," "Uses of Paper." "Astronomy
for January" and "New Star In Perseus."
All of the articles are well and clearly
illustrated with photographs or working
plans and so are of practical use. The
subjects and their treatment vary la
range for the benefit of the boy who has
only the simplest tools with which to
work to the lad who is the proud owner
of a complete shop. In the February
number the studies in electricity are con
tinued. The young idea is also educated
in the intricacies of making a medical coll,
a home-made colonial clock, a house boat,
and further given many handy receipts.
"Amateur Work" will prove a lasting
source of delight to any boy.

"If .1 run across anybody that would
like to know how you're getting on," he
said gently, as he turned away, "I'll Just
tell them that I've adopted you."
. Later in the day, while galloping along
the big divide which separates the Trinity
watershed from Union Creek, it suddenly
occurred , to Brockman vthat he did not
know the name of the woman he had
started out to find for some as yet unde
fined purpose,-nor even thatof the man
upon whom he had determined to force a
quarrel at the earliest opportunity. He
blamed himself- at first for" not having
wormed -v this 'information 'out of the boy,
but a little reflection convinced him that,
while tho maverick might have told him
IiIh own name, the little chap would not
have named ,; the gambler who was to
blame for his 'having been hoi adrift to
shift for himself. The . woman, very
likely, wan known by the gambler's name.
To hnve asked for thnt would have been
to. tell the little chap that bis nhnme waÂ»
no socrot to the men he was living among.
And Drockman would not have given hi*
maverick that f pain for anything In tho
world, ,
lie fell to Â¦peculating about what kind
of a: woman thin must bo .who could cut
herself off. from a child whom apparently

"Been having, a bad* dream?" Brock
man asked.
"They're coming again. I heard them,"
he said.
"Who?" Benois asked, while Brockman
took a look about In the brush.
"Indians," the boy replied.
"Kinder late In the day to be getting
scared, my maverick." .Ed said, with a
tsmile meant to be rcattsuring. "You're
nervous and you Just droamed about 'em "
"Hell! 1 believe he's right. Ed " Benolx
cried. He had fallen back, and now nad
his ear to the ground. "Something**
coming; J can hear It."
Urockman bent to the ground and
caught a rumble off toward the prairie
"Jt's thÂ« boys with the wagon, I reckon,"
he tsald.
"Wonder if those Indians have made
for the Territory, or if they're hanging
around In the brush for another try at
the bunch." Brockman said, rather sud
denly changing the subject. "1 saw half
a dozen of 'em sneaking up back of the
corral when 1 started the herd."
"They ain't waiting, or they'd have
come out in the open after us before
this," Benois replied. "They know the
country's up behind 'em on account of
the M'.lliken killing. Bet they're making
tracks for the Nation right now as hard
as ever they can."
Of a sudden the maverick sat bolt up
right and stared about him in a frightened
manner.
"Well, I owe him one mighty good
turn," Benois said, "and when it comes
my way to do anything for him, I hope
I'll break the other leg If I ain't saddled
up and ready."
"It dun't ki< in quite right thnt he should

huvv company while I'm laid up, if the
signs ain't changed."
"He does iook used up," Brockman
agreed, studying the boys face. "Poor
little chap. But he's better off with Ub
than he would be in there lying around
the post. He don't want to\ talk none
about his people for some reason. His
mother's gone away for a time, and he
must learn to do something against bhe

her. That's the way he puts it. But
there's them at the post, as I told you,
that say she's gone oif with a short-card

guess the mother must have been driven
by hard luck into taking up with the card
sharper. Hi.s thinking she'll come back
to him is what puzzles me. Like enough
she went away to save him the shame of
it. Anyway, he's my bunkie from now
en till he's able tc take care of himself."
"We couldn't .find hlÂ» sign." said Ed.
"You xnuKt have rubbed it out after him.
But how did he come to be down when
you were thrown?"
"He wasn't." Benois said. "Just nulled
up und t-.i'l off when he t*aw the buckhktn
in in i lit-. Didn't know he wan atiywheio
around until he gave me a hand to get
mil from under. Then 1 told him to mount
and lite out, and hu 'lowed the bronk
could carry double. Then we had the
fUMt about It."
"Well, for a little cutis he's mighty
hundy." Kd nald, regurdlng his muvcrick
with admiration; "mighty handy, not to
be Texan bred."
"No. You stay here and look after
them, and I'll 'tend to the wagon," re
plied Daiton. "The boys ought to be jubt
about starting in with the norses, and it
won't take us long to hitch up."
In another minute he was tearing his
way out through the brush, and a few
seconds later they heard him galloping
away across the prairie. Worn out, the
maverick dropped beside Benois and soon
was fast asleep.
"This'll save your boy a hard job. Eu,"
said Benois. "Another trip like last
night's would about finish him."
"What do you mean?" Brockman asked.
"And how did he get here, anyway?"
"Why. if you fehows hadn't found us I
reckon he'd a-been a-dragging of me off
tc the ranch by now. Never could have
got under cover if he hadn't helped me.
Carried my gun and stood by me like a
big one. Wanted to help me up on his
mount, but the bronk broke away while
we were lussing about it. Expected they'd
be a-comine out of the timoer on us at
any minute, so we made for this bot
tom."
Benois came to and saw the maverick
standing at his feet. He smiled laintly.
"You'll do, young one," â¢ he mutteied.
Then he saw the others, and raised him
self on one Â«lbow to -greet them. "I've
got it good and hard tnis deal," said he.
"It'll be a long time before X can sling
that over a saddle again." and he gazed
ruefully at the fractured limb.
"That's all right, Pole," Dalton said,
cheerfully. "We ain't like people thai
can't take care of you while it's mending.
But well have a job to get you to the
ranch."
"We'll need the wagon to take him
in." said Brockman. 'Hadn't I better
make a. break for it?"
CHAPTER IXâ Continued.
/Â¦^f o at a gallop they followed the
trail left by Benois, and where it

A *io answer at rirst, but at the sec-

ejaculated, compromising between a de

"You ain't a-going to quit the hunt, are

"I'm a-going to Henrietta," Brockman
replied.
CHAPTER XII.
BROCKMAN AS A NEW DON
QUIXOTE.
Dalton came into the room where Be
nois and Brockman were and he seemed
worried. Benois was the first to notice it
the nation .before you strike across for
Henrietta." Â¦'Â¦!-Â¦ - , â¢ . â¢
Brockman i selected a, big gray stallion
for his mountâ an. animal that had lorded
it over' a bunch of wild horses. until one
day- when, with most of his herd, he
walked into a- blind corral and found
himself trapped. Brockman had broken
him-aftef a great dedl of trouble, and he
knew : the animal .. had .: no equal in " that
part of the country either for.speed or for
endurance. When he had saddled the
gray and ldoked to . his Winchester and
six-shooter and stuffed some Jerked beef
and some, biscuit into his. saddle pockets;
he went in to say a word to the maverick.
He found the little 1 fellow conscious, . but
very weak. Â¦.Â«.-. . . â¢,
"I'm going away for. a time," -he said,
simply. "Benois will look after you. as
weir as he can, and you must look after
Benois."
"Where are you , going?" the boy
asked. . -
"To Henrietta," Ed replied. "Do you
know anybody there?"
The maverick covered his face with his
hands and did not answer. A. little later,
when he took his hands away to cling to
Brockman's big fist, there were tears in
his eyes, but he said nothing. Brockman
made no further attempt to force his con-
mg. He put l\ in his own pocket. Then
he bathed the maverick's face, forced
some quinine coffee between his lips and
sat down to watch beside him.
All night long the boy talked in a wild
manner. New he was imploring some
one to come away with him; and again
ht was declaring that another some one
had better make good his threat to kill
him or else stop being cruel to the ilrst
some one. Then he wou;d fall to petting
that first some one, pleading with her no:
to cry, and promising that it would all be
right as>"soÂ«n as he could get work and
make money enough to take her "back
home."
And then for a moment he imagineu
they were there. "This Is home," he cried,
sitting up on his couch and stretching
out his arms â "Kentucky, mammy! Good
old Kentucky!" Then the mother slipped
away from him. for he fell back crying,
"Oh. she's goneâ she's gone!".
There was more, much more. In the
same strain; some of it of a nature to
make Brockman grit his teeth, and all of
St showing him Glimpses of a life which,
in his conscious moments, the boy hud
done his best to conceal. And as he lis
tened and pieced together the rambling
talk an idea began to take shape in his
mind. Finally, with the coming of day
light, the boy fell Into . a heavy sleep.
Then Brockman left him and went to con-
be otherwise," said -he, "she's everything
to him, anu she- did- a cowardly Unrig. to
runolt and leave him. If she don't know
it now, she will when I gee a chance at
her. And if I don't give "that card-sharper
cause to threaten' somebody bigger than
the maverick, then 1 don't Know my own
brand." . 'Â¦'Â¦
"I'd like to get a crack at that fellow
myself." Benoia said, "but it ain't likely
that we'll ever come across him.' If he
knows when the paymaster's due, he may
get back to Â¦ Jacksboro then to skin , the
soldiers. Outside of that it's a blind trail.
We don't know whore he's gone, nor even
what he calls hisself." Â¦'â¢ :
"Maybe this wii.1 tell us," Ed said,
handing Benois the paper that had fallen
from the maverick's pocket. ~
Benois knocked the asnes out of. his
pipe, laid it aside, took the paper, opened
it very deliberately and settled. himself
back comfortably to read it. Almost at
once his manner changed, his brows con
tracted, and he drew himself up. into a
tense attitude. Brockman watched him
intently, unconsicously-mimicklng his ex
pression. When Benois finished with a
snort of indignation and crumpled the
paper in his hand, Brockman also snorted,
clenched his lists, and then sprang to his
feet. .
"The rope's too good for a man like
that," Benois declared, with an oatb. >
that she was a little, clinging. a ffec j*> n :
ate, timid woman that a- man could
frighten with a frown. He had known a
woman like that once, and she had a big
brute of a husband who was unkind, to
her; there was something about her that
used to make him think of a dog-tte
more she was abused the closer sne

. Brockman never had come in . contact
with the type of womanhood that is a
martyr to conscience and duty as a â¢ sm \
of religious training and culture, and it
â¢puzzled him to make the inherited mental
qualities and the patient courage of hb
maverick fit In with the weak character
he had Just reasoned out to be that boy a
mother.- . - ':Â¦"
"However It happens, It's a da 11 " 1^
shame," he muttered, as he pulled up to
study the basin of the Big Wichita, which
lay before him. "and I'm going to fet .it
right if any one man can do it. I " see
him throughâ and his mother, too, lor
his sake." \; Â¦Â¦- y â¢"Â¦.â¢â¢- - r S\ 111
He; had started down the divide into
the wooded bottom of the Wichita when
the gray stallion suddenly came to a stand
and, throwing up his head, sniffed the
air. Brockman regarded the timber sus
piciously for a moment, then pulled tne
Winchester from beneath his leg and
pumped a cartridge Into the barrel. At
' the same time the stallion pawed the
earth and neighed shrilly. From the tim
ber then there came a succession 01
whinneylngs, betraying the presence in
its shade of a number of horses.'
"Good old boy," said Ed, patting. the
stallion's neck. "With your nose and my
eyes they'll sure need a right smart trap
to catch us." "'-
Brockman turned his horse back up the
divide. There came a halloo from the
timber, and the runner from Milliken's
rode into view and waved his hand.
. Half a dozen men followed him out of
the timber, i One of these, Brockman rec
ognized as Foreman Wilson of the Herald
outfit. He waited for them to come up,
and learned that they were on the way to
Join Ikard's men. '
"They were all out on a round-up when
I reached the Herald camp." the runner
from Milliken's explained, "and I had to
wait for them to come in. We re going
on now to get Ikard's men out." N
"Then there's no need of my going any
further," said Ed. "You all can tell them
that we've got one man laid up with a
broken leg, and another sick, and Dalton
can'l leave them alone. He was afraid
you'all might go out after the Indians,
thinking that he was trailing them up,
so I was sent to tell you that we couldn't
follow. We've thinned "em out a few.
though. They ain't as many by eight as
they were when they came In. I'm going
to strike across here to Henrietta, but If
-I hit a fresh trail I'll turn back to Ikard's.
They must be off to the northeast of- us
here somewhere, and if you're going out
after them my advice to you is to try
and 'bush them up above, near the- falls,
;or over where the big buffalo trail crosses
Pease Rfver."
"We'll have a try at them, anyhow,"
* Foreman Wilson said. "They got some of
our horses the last time In, and we owe
' them a llcklnp. If we find they haven't
crossed the Wichita, we'll turn back
across country and hunt them up."
With that .understanding they parted
companv. Brockman turning off to the
east and the others continuing up the
Wichita. After crossing the Little Wich
ita. Brockman bore away to the south of
Henrietta, not caring to risk an encounter
single-handed with the Kiowas, and be
lieving them to be near by to the north.
. It was night when he reached a point al
most due south of and about twenty
seven miles- from Henrietta. He knew
of .a little stream there where the trail
from Jacksboro crossed, and expected to
make camp for the night near the 1 cross
ing. He could then reach Henrietta In
the morning in time for breakfast.
As he drew near the crossing he saw
a campflre 1 pHmmerinsr In th^ brush near
the trail. "Buffalo hunters." he said to
himself, "and nhorthorns . at that, else
they'd have put their fire out at dark.
That's an Invlt* to call that a Kiowa
could nee with hlÂ» eves shut."
Without dismounting he made a recon
nolssanee, and saw a wagon drawn uo at
one.*!dfi tt the trail. He waited to hear
voice*, and. not hearlmr them, drew
nearer. A little cru*t of. wtnd caiifttrt the
fire to 1 flarw up brljchtly for a moment,
and by It* llsrht he cntieht a rllmpÂ«Â« of a
woman seated in n delected attitude on a
blanket beside the wagon.
CHAPTER XIII.
THE LONE CAMPER. ''7
As she heard the tread of an approach
ing horse the woman started up and
called out tremulously: "Is that you,
James?"
. "Nope," aald Brockman, as he rode Into
the camp; "this chap was christened Ed,
and his mad brand Is Brockman. Howdy,
ma'am; and whore's the men folks?"
"I thought it was my husband," the
woman said falteringly. "He has gone
to look for one of our horses. Won't you
âwon't you get down and have some
coffee?" she asked, hesitatingly, as tf un
certain whether she ought to extend the
Invitation.
S "To be sure, and thank you for It," Ed
replied heartily, wondering, as he dis
mounted, -where he might have met this
, woman, so familiar did her voice Bound
to him. As he turned toward her, one
arm thrust through his bridle reins and
the thumbs of both hands hanging on the
edge of the cartridge belt at his hips, she
shrank back toward the wagon as if In
some sort of dread of him.
"I can go on, ma'am," he said gently,
"if you feel uneasy. about me." K
"No, no," she replied hurriedly, as If
ashamed that she had mistrusted him.
"Have ~ something to eat first." Then
from the boot of the wagon she brought a
tin plate and a cup and a knife and fork,
which she placed upon the blanket. ' From
the fire she took a skillet with some ham
In it, and the coffee pot and a platter with
a pone of bread upon it. These she
placed beside the plate, and invited him
to help himself. v
"Is James likely to be gone long?" Ed
asked, as he dropped the bridle reins so
that the gray might browse.
"I cannot tell; 1 hope not," his hostess
replied, her suspicions evidently aroused
again by the question. . '
"Well, as he ain't here to do it," Ed
said, "I'll Just bank this fire. for him. It
shows too bright out there on the prairie
and might bring him some troublesome
company." As he spoke he heaped the
ashes up over the blazing embers.
"You don't seem to have had much
luck with the buffalo," he went on, as he
plumped down and helped himself to the
food, "seeing as you haven't any. hides.
Â¦You should come down on our range.
They're plenty enough* there â out Union
Creek way. And a precious lot of trouble
Â¦ they give us. for they feed in among the
Â¦cattle, and every time they wind one of
us they stampede like mad, and the fool
steers Just run off with 'em and keep us
a-killlng of our horses to cut 'em out."
"We are not buffalo hunters," the
woman Bald, smiling at his mistake.
"No? Then what in the name of tho
great muley cow have you been a-camp
lng here a week for? Nobody that knows
this country would come here to picnic."
"How do you know that we have been
- here a week?" the woman asked, all sus
picion again.
' "You'd never have burnt wood enough
to make that pile of nshes In less time,"
Ed replied, pointing to . the smoldering
* campnre. ''That's how I know it.
You're not thinking nbout taking up
land herp. are you? Not that I want to
Knoon Into your affairs; but thin here Is
no nfftca for a white woman. It's too closo

Tho woman started up with n cry.
"What do you mean?" she asked, clnsn
' Ing her. hands and staring into his face.
""Why do you come here to say this to
me? Is this some trick of my husband's?"
"This ain't nobody's trick but mine,"
Brockman said gravely, as he rose to his
feet. "That little chap is my bunkie.
I've got him in charge. I've adopted him.
He belongs to me now, and his trouble is
my trouble. I've come out to find hia
mammyâ was going to Henrietta to hunt
for her and that there gambler'. Not to
hurt her," he protected, as she drew
away from him; "not to hurt her. though
I won't say as much for the gambler.
.UUt just to tell her that the little chap is
down sickâ sore in head and heart and
body at the way he's been treated. Not
that he complains to me, or to any one.
Oniy that the fever gets into hia head
and makes him see things and talk about
them I ii never have known any. more
than those folks at the post know. But
he's siek and grieving for a sight of the
woman that ran away from him toâ to
go off with a blackleg. And he's plan
ning all the time When the fever's on
how he's going to take her home and
care for her. So I just made up my mind
to lind her and tell her so. and to tell
her as well, that if there's any decency
left in her she'll up and go back to Jacks
boro and wait there untilâ well, until he'
can take her back to Kentucky. That's
what I ve come out to tell her."
The woman sank soubing beside thÂ«
wagon. "You don't know." she criedâ
"you 'do not know. It was for his sake
âto save himâ that I left him so." She
covered her face with her hands and
trembled violently in the effort to sup
press her emotion. "I knew that ho
would suffer," she moaned; "but I had
begged him to be brave and to wait. Oh.
my poor iittle boy!" '
jJrockmun's mind turned to the letter
of farewell that he had in his pocket, and
his conscience smote him. That waa sin
cere, he felt sure, and the grief- of this
woman at his feet was pitiable. He be
gan to fear that he bad taken too much
lor granted. He was a big brute, he told
himself. "What right had he to set him
self up as this woman's Judge? Besides,
there surely was something back of it all
that he did not know. The woman did Â¦
not love the card-sharper; that much was
clear from her letter to the boy. Why.
then, did she desert a child whom she did
love to go with a man for whom she cared
nothing. That was the puzzle. She had
spoken of the gambler as "my husband."
Perhaps, after all, he was her husband!
What a fool not to have thought at It
before! And he had just been treating
her as if she were a woman of the town*
had talked to her as to a person who had
degraded herself by traveling with a
man who, whatever else he might be,
was perhaps her legal protector. It It
should turn out that way, he said to him
self, then he had done the maverick urn
good, and had only wounded somebody
who was very dear to the boy. What *
blunderer he was, anyway, and how It
hurt to look at that woman to tears.
"Look a-bere. Missus Jim"â Brockman' â¢
voice was a bit husky in spite of bis
effort to be calm as he bent over herâ
"will you just answer me one question,
for the boy's : sake?"
"Yes; I have nothing to conceal," she
sobbed.
"I don't want to hurt your t eelin*s any
more, butâ are you truly married to 'this
cuss?"
"What right have youâ what right has
any one to doubt it?" she cried fiercely,
getting upon her feet. "Yes; to my ever
lasting n;isery. I am hia wife. The shame
of that lies only in the deceit he prac
ticed on me, and In bis cruelty to my
child."
Brockman struck his clenched right
hand upon the palm of his left. 'Â¦ It was
as If he were punishing himself for a
fault.
"Then I've wronged you, and I can't
say no more than that I'd sooner have
been beat to death than have done It. I
wanted to do something for the boy â to
turn you back for his sake if things had
been different. It'll do you good anyhow
to know that he has friends who won't let
him want for anything thgy can give
him. And you can Just say to yourself.
If ever there should be need, 'My boy's
friends will be my friends,' and you won't
be making any mistake. I'mâ I'm sorry,
Missus Jim." a
She made no reply, and he went on:
"I'd better be going before that gam
bler gets back. Seeing that he really is
your husband, I ain't got no business with
him. But I don't like to leave you here
alone. The country ain't safe Â¦, when th*
moon's like thia. When did be go out
after that horse?" *
"At noon of the day before yesterday."
she answered, sobblnr more tfoftly now.
for the cowboy's willingness to befriend
her, as he had befriended her child,
touched her deeply, and made, her willing
to forget the brutal . things hejhad said.
"And you've been here all alone sine*
then?" he asked in astonishment.
She' nodded. "The strain and/ the
solitude have made me a bit hysterical.
I'm afraid," she said, as if offering an
Â¦ apnloKy for her weakness. "And I've
been tortured by a horrible fear that per
hapsâ perhapsâ" .* "
'.'That perhaps you might be left
here?" the cowboy suggested.
She buried her face In her hands and
did not reply.
"You might have been scalped a dosen
times as it is," he said to her then, "for
the country's 1 full of Indians. You must
ge out of this. You can't go on waiting
here. I'll takeâ"
There came a scream from the gray
stallion. They turned Just In time to see
a dark form vaulting for the saddle. It
did not land there, for the stallion
swerved and made a sudden buck Jump
which dislodged it. As It was falling a
pair of wicked heels shot out and caught >
the intruder fairly upon the head, casting
him senseless and bleeding at their feet.
At the sight of the Indian the woman
reeled and would have fallen had not
Brockman caught her.
"We can't stay here/* he cried.
"There's sure to be wore of them near
by. We must run for It."
While speaking he had dragged her
toward the stallion. He lifted her as If
she were a child and placed her in tne
saddle. Vaulting into place behind her.
he slipped his left arm under hers and
gathered . the reins. Then, taking his
six-shooter in his right hand, he headed
the gray toward Jacksboro. .The stallion
refused to move out. As Brockman let
feel the spur he backed off In the
opposite direction.
"There must be something I can't sea
out there ahead of us." said Ed, "and he
knows it. We'll have to make for Hen
rietta. It's a shorter run, anyhow."
Turned in the way he wanted to go and
given his head the biff stallion plunged
through the brush and out upon the trail
to the north. As they made the open
prairie a chorus of fierce yells and half a.,
dozen shots from beyond the wagon told
them that their flight, was discovered.
"Don't be afraid," he said, as he ft-lt.
her tremble in his arms. "LiKe enough
they were all down. They've got to get
back to their mounts before they can
follow. And there ain't a horse in the
country that can hoof it with thl* one." : I
There was no reply, and looking down f
Into her face as the big gray horse bore
them swiftly along, Brockman saw that
she had fainted.

BROCKMAN'S MAVERICK
~ '.Q1/AILBY AUGUSTA PRESCOTT.
fHE girl of summer comes tripping
' toward us and it Is pleasant to go
out to meet her upon the way.
She wears a sunny smile, as befits
her mission, and an artless man
ner. She also wears. a shirt waist..
When will woman ever be divorced from
this shirt waist of hers? It is as though
she had looked long for that which she
sought and having once found It had de
termined to cling to it forevermore.
lii selecting the shirt waist aÂ«s her con
stant friend the woman of to-day has
shown her good taste; she has forever
freed herself from the charge of not
knowing a good thing when she taw it.
Hygienic, pretty, inexpensive, becoming,
stylish, useful, easy to obtain; all these
qualities and many more can . be attrib
uted to the summer shirt waist.
It would be well if. with its other un
fading virtues, the shirt waist could be
maintained at its original cost, which was
of a dollar or less. But it bas received

Very justly have such waists taken
their places along with the very fine

with white satin skirts this summer, J for

a plait or fold at the shoulder line. It is
not.a- difficult thing to accomplish; but the
material must be a stuff with a body,

A; self-stock is worn with the shirtwaist
of. the. more serviceable variety. The
popular style for this stock is the wash-,
able shape, which calls for a long,
straight .piece, of the goods, so planned
that- it' can be crossed In the back and
the ends brought around ; to the front,
.where they; come in under, a buckle of
the plainest sort. The simple .harness'
buckle is the approved one and the whole
has a | gentlemanly finish that is much
liked by a the summer shirt waist girl;
baggy effect that makes the blouse-like
sleeve. ' The whole comes into a tight cuff <'
at the wrist, which is of- needlework. : .
The cuff can be elaborated by a puff
and then by more needlework. This Is not Â¦
a bad waist for the amateur to-experi
ment upon, for in certain ways It- Is easy
to make. A series' at the extremely pop
ular pin tucks anywhere will conceal a
multitude of .dressmaking, sins.

From the standpoint of economy, none of

of them comes high. Nor will they stand

To be very much in the fad the summer
girl can select her birthstone and have
three pins, one for the front of her stock,
one for the back of her stock and one for
the back of her hair. It will hold up the
little 1 short and look very nice,
' besides catering to a fancy. < Â¦

Pins for the Stock.
Old cuff buttons, round and unwieldy,
are useful for this purpose and look very
well Bet In pin style. A jeweler puts on
the pin and arranges it so that it looks
as though it had never been a cuff button.
, The new shirt, waists have collars that
are hooked in the back and very often the
hook- shows.- Or there is a collar button,
occurring In the middle of the back of the
band, and this shows.- The twin pin covers
this -and establishes neatness and finish.
' There come the most attractive little
bands of white linen, with a hemstitching
along each Â¦ edge, or with a catstitchlng.
This trimming can be bought by the yard,
and it Is Just right for. the adornment of
the. plain shirtwaist; It saves work, too,
for it need. only, be applied just as one
would sew on braid, whereas tucks mean
work, and embroidery is a matter of ap
plied art. vi-'V"-;- ' Â¦â¢Â¦" Â¦Â¦ .
The polka dotted materials are used to
trim white and pale blue. There is the
old-fashioned white, with black polka dots
and this Is one of the most useful of trim
mings. It is cut up and made into bands,
and this la applied to the shirtwaist so
as to outline a sailor collar.
By a little trick It can be sewed only by
the upper edge, and in this way the collar
semblance Is complete. The lower edge
of .the' polka dotted band will project over
the shoulders and lie loose upon the back
and front of the waist. A .little taste
must be used in. doing work of this de
scription.
. There is a fad. this summerâ for when
was the summer girl ever - fadlÂ«ssâ for
using twin -pins upon the front and back
of ' the , stock. Large round cameos - are
sat in gold frame work and the pins are
set; one in .the 'middle of the front and
one in the middle of the back.
Shirt Trimmings.
The Duchess of Marlborough, who, as a
brunette,'' affects white continually, re
cently ordered' of h'er London: shlrtmaker
a set of padded overllds, filled with sachet,
to Jay r between her shirt waists, as they
wero piled In' their boxes. - Â» .
The Duchess boasts the finest lace waist
In the' world of washable fabrics. It Is all
of Valenciennes 'lace, with the rows cun
ningly put together with hemstitching. It
Is perfectly sheer and Ms worn, over a
waist of India lawn, which, in: turn, re
quires a corset ; cover, for the hand can
be seen through* It as through chiffon.
- In the vralst that is planned for the
woman who is worth less than ten mil
lions there is the grass linen, which cornea
in brown and green and in other tones,
with brown and green leading In favor.
There is no waist as serviceable as this
and none that should be so much the
subject of study by the woman of every
day tastes. How to vary the brown grass
linen waist so that one day it will look
dressy enough for luncheon and the next
day plain enough for housework should
bo looked into by her.
The brown waist or the tan waist, which
Is the prettier name for. this color, may
be made to run tho whole gamut of style.
It can be made up with yoke and cuffs
and stock of Oriental goods. Or It can
be mude up with the white lac* yoke and
the white lace stock and cuffs. ' These
fancy materials give it a light look, for
tan seems to mirror Its surroundings and
can bemad* paler or darker.
' A very good way to trim thÂ« brown linen
waist Is with straps of white. Let two
of them run down the front and let straps
trim the yoke* In stray fashion from tne
collar to the bust. A band of white can
border the cuffs.
The tan waist will be so thoroughly In
fashion that it will be difficult to entirely
remove It from the domain of style, no
matter how it Is treated, but it may be
made I prettier by one treatment than by
another.
For | Consuela's Waists.
be a. Jersey Illy as long as she lives and
bants, is out this spring in a white wash
waist of lawn bo sheer that it shows the
underwalst. This is in pure pale green,
without a touch of yellow or blue in it, a
clear green that Langtry affects.
An Immense picture hat of black ana
green goes with this waist. Her skirt Is a
long trailing one in black silk, trimmed
â¢ with an open lace design, with flowers in
lace, coming here and there upon the silk.
. This Is told to show that the white
;w'ash waist really, appears in the King's
set and that famous beauties are wear
ing it. , . Â¦ . . -'' -
Great diversity * in pattern cannot be
claimed for the new summer waist. It is
really much less varied than it was last
~year. It is almost entirely made in white
and the waists that are not made in white
are in the very delicate tones that might
as well be white, as far as their wearing
qualities are concerned, for they soil just
as soon and are just as perishable.
After washing, when they have taken
. on a still ''paler tone, then they are prac
tically white and might be laid away in
: a drawer that is devoted to white waists.
They are selling shirt waist boxes for
the keeping of the nicer waists. These are
lined with silk and , very highly scented.
' The waistsare laid In them while damp,
to absorb the fragrance. The cover shuts
tightly. If juph a box cannot_be pur
~chasecl,"*a Very '" goo'd . substitute can be
made out of a pasteboard box, lined with
-silkÂ«or^with cheesecloth, which is quite
as good, and gives forth the sachet better.
It is almost a pity that the shirt wai3t
should ever have departed frorn U3-pri
mal simplicity. But now that it has gone
Â©ut of its humble domain and is launched
into the great world of -fashion one can
only welcome it, for even with its f rills
and fixings it 13 a great improvement
upon every other . waist, and â¢ no- matter
how . expensive it may have:become there
is always an imitation waist, almost as
good, that will answer the purpose. ;
"The trl-corner hat would look well
with such a suit, and the newest three
cornered â¢ hats are trimmed with a band
of gold cord around the .edge and another
band, of gold- cord below that, wfci'.a
gold rosettes, very neat and very small,
loop the hat. -This Is very coquettish, but
requires a pretty forehad or a pretty
hang.
"The hair drapery for Easter should be
low and the hair should be. pulled down
in long waves that He nearly to the eye
brows. ,' Such very .good effects are ob
tained with the three-cornered hat thus
treated.". . Â¦'.
"It cannot be cut more prettily than as
a new little short coat, one of .the sort
that Is trimmed with tan-colored lace. It
is open in front to show the Irish lace
shirt waist. A hat can exactly match in
blue.
A Modiste's Idsa.
The front came' almost to the belt aai
the back was as abort aÂ» the shoulders.
This was to be slipped on over,* shirt
waist of whlto India muslin, which was
perfectly plain, round and of a full blouse
pattern.^ â¢:Â¦Â¦
Of course the collar could bÂ« laundered
separately. If the fancy dictated It could
be lined with a bit of pink silk or wttfc
white, which makes the prettiest lining.
Positive sensations will be created at
Newport, that city of dress, this summer
by those who wear bUck and white.
Black gowns with dashes of whits will
be seen, and, the distinction between them
and the badly selected colored gowns will
be apparent. The critical stud/ of black
and white might be the topic for a dress)
lecture.
So very many of the waists button down
the backâ so very many. To Quote from
a modiste who Is designing a new shirt
waist for a woman to wear during vÂ«Wh
as part of an Easter shirt waist suit:
"The waist that buttons .down the back
is certainly In. and more's the pity, tot
it is difficult to fasten and. to the woman
who lives In a hotel, It means a tip every
time, quite a noticeable amount when
reckoned up at the close of the season.
"Large, handsome buttons are- â¢. worn
down the back, and are, made noticeable
in point of ornamentation.
. "If I were going to hav* oae THantur
suit and only .one. and It were Incumbent
upon me to wear it all the spring, I would
select one In fine blue serge; something
between a bright blue and a navy. This
I would make most modlshly by trim
ming the skirt with heavy lace, around
the bottom and with stitched bands at
the bead of the lace. -
"If lace - seemed â¢ too perishable, ' there
come handsome silk bands, all stitched,
that can be put on from the hem of the
skirt upward at Intervals of sis or eight
inches, the bands all of different lengthy
so that they come up high and others are
shorter.
The "Laco Collar*.
Sleeves, while mightily fancy, are also
mightily plain. You can be In style with
a full sleeve that Is simply brought In to
the cuff, gathered In such a way that
most of the fullness la at the back of the
sleeve to make a little bag. Of course
there are sleeves that show more varie
ties, but these are more for the fluffy sum
mer girl than the summer shirt waist girl.
The new shiny materials are very much
In style again, but for a while even they
are overshadowed by the wonderful de
mand for -the filmy white fabrics. There
Is this about the sheer white stuffs that
they look like lace, and betweentlace ana
women there has been an affiliation.
A cunning mode bas been introduced by
one of the best modistes, one who makes
many shirt waists for' Newport each
summerâ ehlrt waists by the myriad. This
is for the making of lac* collars and cuffs
to be worn with certain .waist*, fin* re
cently completed a Tudor collar of Irish
crocheted lace.
It would be positively cruel to hint at
the extravagance to which the summer
shirt waist Is being carried. It is now
classed with the summer luxuries and
ranks with the frills and fine fancies. It la
a mass of lace and Insertion, the finer and
the more delicate the better. Often it la
so delicate a thing that another under
walst is required to wear beneath it and
all these waists are a part of the plan of
the summer shirt waist.
None of the new models show the very
long point, though all are longer In the
front than in the back. They are pulled
down a little, that Is all, and fastened
low. -This Is accomplished by means of
the dress skirt, which Is caught down with
the corset hook or other contrivance, thus
making the waist seem longer.
Girls of great Blenderness are wickedly
wearing the very short waisted shirt
waist. They know that they can do It.
but that It will look funny on the fat
sister.
The Belt line.
The round waist is advised for all who
are not slim. This waist la brought to a
point in front, but not to the exaggerated
point known as the French point. This
very long point Is a mistake for the fat
woman, though she Is the one of all wo
men who may be convinced that she can
wear it: Do not think because you hav*
pulled your waist down to a point six
inches below your belt line that you nec
essarily look slender. Often you look gru
tesque.

ALLISON'S OBJECTIONS.
Â¦ Bacon had inserted In his . remarks . a
table . showing the exports r of . American
products " from . the ' port of Boston' for ten
months': " the object being/ to show that
the . bulk of these . products was carried
in slow â¢ vessels, Â¦ much in vessels under
1000 -tons : burden. These vessel, 1 he^ con
tended, would receive little "or 'no* 'sub- 1
sidy. ; Similar . tables were presented for
the ports of _ Savannah, Ga.,- Galveston
and other places. , .
: Discussing briefly the. general purposes
of the . bill, . Bacon .' said that "the word
"subsidy" had no 'terror . for him. If a
bill . to - provide Increased compensation
for. mall lines - between this, country ; and
South America, for. instance, .was pend
ing before Â¦ the - Senate, he - would support
it. He ; was opposed, 'â¢ however,' to ? boun.
ties, the effect of- which would be. to give
compensation to ' those who i did not
need'. it. .. '. : Â¦ . . ..â¢ Â¦ Â¦.' ... Â¦ . ' Â¦ -. '
Inthe course of some remarks in sup
port of the amendment Bacon urged. that
the Postmaster General ought not to be
made, responsible forV the"" demanding of
such contracts. It, was. such a delegation
of .authority- by. Congress as ; he did not
, think would be approved I by the Amerlr
can people. â¢ , ' â¢ -. : â¢
Â¦ Bacon of Georgia : gave notice' of an
amendment, which _. he ; proposed to 'offer
to the . subsidy bill, providing that - no

of the. discriminating duties copld-be ab
rogated, he [ thought,. without difficulty.
ment he proposed to offer providing that
no vessel should be entitled to full, com
pensation under the act unless she shall
have cleared from a port in the United
States with at least 50 per cent of her
cargo capacity, and that the subsidy paid
such vessels should be reduced In propor
tion, to the reduction of her cargo below
50 per* cent of her capacity.
Allison believed that there ought to be
a limitation upon the aggregate amount
of subsidy to be paid annually under the
bill.
Continuing Allison expressed the convic
tion that the aggregate amount to be ex
pended'under the bill should be limited,
and he suggested an amendment limiting
the amount of mail pay under the bill for
each year until 1907 to, $3,000,000 annually,
and after that. date to $3,000,000. He said
that : If no limitation . were fixed In the
matter of price he did not doubt that by
next October (election time) thÂ« public
would: be told that ths amount would
reach $50,000,000 annually.
Â¦; Allison said that he had no limitation to
suggest in connection with the subsidy,
because it could be repealed at 'any tim*.
APPARENT TO ALL.
Spooner of Wisconsin said that with the
general motives of the bill no good Amer
can could, find himself In opposition. The
desirability that the American products
should be carried in American merchant
marine was apparent to alL
Personally he Ions ago had formed the
opinion that' the true method of the re
vival of our merchant marine was by the
levylngr of discriminating duties, but our
hands â¢ had* been tied by treaties which
prevented the levying of such duties. If
the United States should denounce those
treaties . harm . might follow, but he did
not; take kindly, he said, to the doctrine
that the United States forever was to be
bound by treaties with our competitors.
The -passage of the . pending bill would
produce retaliation and the relation
caused by the abrogation of the treaties
would.: differ only in name. He said he
would not have voted for the bill of laat
year.
As to the pending measure he said he
did not like to vote for the making of
contracts involving the appropriation of
vast sums of money unless it was evi
dent clearly that the object sought to
be accomplished by the bill would be ac-

Therese." Mendes responded to his
"despotic sovereign," offering the piece
tor the coming season. "Bernhardt then
replied . to her !'Darling Friend," promis
ing to produce If March 1. Mendes there
upon telegraphed' as a reply, "Dear
Ihereseâ The play and the - author are
yours."
Â¦; But later he heard that Madame Bern
hardt . was maJKing . conflicting . arrange
ments and telegraphed for explanations.
This time Madame Bernhardt merely ad
dressed him as \ "Friend, "and said that
her arrangements did not affect the pro
duction , of the piece. Mendes was not'
satisfied, but was Induced to leave the
play with ,. Bernhardt. , The rehearsals
were\begun, but. Mendes says he found
Bernhardt had let her ; theater to an
Italian ' coriipahy for a period which ren
dered the promised -run impossible. He
realized that all was not plain sailing
for." "Sainte Therese," and got back his
manuscript, of which he wrote her, "I will
place in a drawer strewn with red roses,
symbols, of my admiration for Sarah
Bernhardt, and with violets, emblems oÂ£
her- fickleness." ; . 'f
The last communication of Mendes was.
written in the third person and was ail
dressed to "Mine- Sarah Bernhardt.".
Mme. Bernhardt replied to the publication
of these letters by explaining that Mendes
was wrong about the arrangements which
he thought would interfere with his playl .
She intended to give it a run of twenty
nights and could not arrange for a longer
run, because of the risk of losing her Ions
season, which : brings a large sum of
money, and complained that Mendes re
sorted to a trick to get back the manu
script, which, he said, was only, needed
for t a f ew^ corrections. Bernhardt con
cluded her letter as follows:
."In a terrible fit of despair and tears I
drowned my 'illusions,^hopes,* admiration
and my friendship 'for 'that m'an." . 1 "came
out of this crisis^ a physical wreck,, with

"Sainte Therese" to Mme. -Bernhardt, if

VIENNA, 'March 15.â The Neue Freie

that Count Deym, Embassador of Aus

trine, we should never abandon. The bill .is
wrong in principle, unjust, vicious, pure class

.The Senate agreed, at the suggestion of
Berry, to take up the ship subsidy bill
immediately after routine - business on

complished. His investigations induced
him to doubt that the pending bill would
accomplish the; results hoped for by its
advocates. He said, it had been contended
that the bill of last year would no more
than equalize the conditions between this
Country land European countries, arid yet
the present bill': proposes a much lower
subsidy.: ; He! insisted "that' the United
States' Government ought .to know defin
itely that this bill would produce the re
sults claimed for it before it was enacted.
The only ;thing_ absolutely.,. certain about
the measure : was that ships now in ex
istence w'ould receive a large amount of
money until the subsidy was repealed.
Â¦ Spooner gave notice . of an amendment
he proposed. to offer to the bill reser^ng
to Congress the right to amend or. repeal
the measure without, however, impairing
the operation of any contract entered into
under its 'provisions. , ' .. i
- "That wlll;be a notice to all the world,'.'
said he, "that 'this subsidy j is entirely in
the; hands of Congress and that It is not
a foundation upon which to build largely.
We ought to do this thing right, or not do
it at; ail.* For one, I do not feel at all
satisfied with the' bill."
OPPOSITION OF . MINOEITY.
' Senator. Berry - of. Arkansas... represent
ing" the; minority of the Senate Cominlttee
on Commerce, presented the report in op
position .to; the pending ship subsidy bill.
Most of - the points have â¢ been . covered I in
speeches In ; the - Senate. The , minority
deny the accuracy.of both the predictions
and the: facts in the majority; report.
They urge that' the biir is wrong In prin
ciple and. declare that it will utterly fall
in- the accorriplishmerit-"of Its ; professed
objects. They also: say that whilelt is
not. so complicated as the subsidy bill; of
the Fifty-sixth Congress, it is- in, some
respects even more objectionable. The
Ininority continues: ,^g^j
â¢-; The~ bill proposes 'â¢ to ' tax the whole people to
the : extent > of- several- millions for < the benefit
of one single industry. Besides the statistics of
the last two years prove that : the shipbuilding
I Industry, does- not need such! special assistance,
but Is rapidly, increasing ' under natural condi- :
tions. -, i . -\.-.....' : i ;,â--, -; :. . ;-.-
''.They criticize the . feature of , the bill
which 'carries the ; subsidy for foreign
mails and -say:
"a The highest rate of subsidy Is given to twen
ty-knot .vessels," while the fast ocean mails are
really: carried 1n twenty-three and twenty-four
knot : vessels.* .3 The mail : compensation to the
slow ', American , vessela, already - too i high," is
made immensely higher by this- bill.- " We pay
more 'tot- a. [ weekly service than | England pays
for a semi-weekly., service; by much faster ships
than ours. RCtwttSftiifffTilr ' '
â¢They further^ urge -that 'the bill rna^s

claim:, that it- encourages? a' {combination
leading- to ' such a t trusV V. They also say : -*
;.'.The lines, might also merge with foreign 'lines

LYDDITE MAY IMPEBIL
THE FRIENDLY VESSELS
Explosive Seems to Possess the Curi
ous Properties of a Disas
trous .Boomerang 1 .
LONDON, March lo.â The extraordinary'
effect of lyddite has been -revealed by the ij
statement that during the recent experi
ments with the hulk of the old battleship
Belle Isle shells containing that explosive
refracted fragments upon the attacking
vessels, which were 300 yards distant-
Other fragments dropped close to a gun-,
boat situated 2000 yards abeam of the line
of fire. "Â¦;':'Â¦ 'Â¦
The deduction drawn is that when lyd
dite is used there is danger for a friendly
vessel at least 2000 yards away. The Out
look compares. lyddite with a boomerang, Â¦
and points out that to Be of any service
it must b# dropped right on board a hos- '
tile vessel, as "if the projectile does not
hit the right place it will fly back and
slay the slayer."

Despite the, decision of the party lead
ers there , will be a strong tight over the
tjuestion' of- whether the tariff concession
shall be of indefinite, duration ; or for a
limited period. Should the beet sugar
Republicans insist on holding out the
period may not be limited. Should they
show signs of allowing the biir to go
through - for the sake of party harmony
without attempting fatal combinations in
either branch it may be that, "as decided
in Senator Hanna's house yesterday, the
period of reciprocity will be confined to
the- present and next sugar, crops. It is
hoped by the leaders that" the latter plan
will prevail, and that a serious 'party
split may be. avoided.
It was decided to force a vote at the
caucus as early after the .meeting con
vened as possible. This decision was not
reached until air the members of the con
ference thoroughly convinced that
they had votes enough in caucus to in
struct the committee to report the bill.
The programme was finally mapped out
by the House leaders this afternoon at a
meetiug held previous to a conference
with the beet sugar Republicans. There
were present Speaker Henderson, Chair
man Payne and Representatives Dalzell,
Grosvenor and Long. Only one sentiment
was expressed, and that was that it was
useless to dicker any longer. ,
CALL. BUREAU, HOG G STREET, N.
\V., WASHINGTON, March . 15.â A bill
providing, for a; 20 per cent reduction in
tariff rates on Cuban products to cover
the present and next sugar crops, or possi
bly to continue indefinitely, will be
brought to a vote in the Republican cau
cus next Tuesday night. It has been de
termined that the. Senate will not raise
the rate and will stick to the 2")* per cent
reduction of the Ways and Means bill.
.The decision reached by the Republican
leaders is the result of various confer
ences between the House leaders friendly
tc Cuba. and Senators prominent in Re
publican party management. The last
and deciding conference was held yester
day afternoon in the residence of Senator
Hanna, when it was agreed that the inter
ests of the National Republican organiza
tion demanded that action should be taken
to grant concessions to Cuba without fur

Â»FR0M A BABY'S THROAT
SAN JOSE. March 15.â A 13-month-old
baby of Los Gatos swallowed a star
shaped tin tobacco tag five week3 . ago.
and until it wasi removed from its throat
yesterday the infant's life was despaired
of. The child was playing on the floor,
and, finding the tag, put It into Its mouth.
In attempting to swallow it the pronga
of the metal struck in the throat and it
gradually worked its ? way into the
trachea and the entrance to the lungs.
The relieving: operation, which was a
very delicate one for a child of its age,
was performed In the O'Connor Sanitar
ium by Dr. J. U. Hall, assisted by Dr.
F. W. Knowles, Dr. Gober and Dr. Beat
tie. It was necessary to open the esopha
gus or gullet, where the metal tag was
found securely lodged behind the wind
pipe. The operation was a success and
the baby will recover.

Mrs. Addie B. Richardson, wife "of .the
dead man, was the first - witness called
by the defense. She. explained her pres
ence at different times with Fife. The
only time she had gone riding with him
was when her husband requested her to
drive the horse to the public square and
water it, telling her at the same time to
take Fife along. When seen on. the stone
steps with Fife she said she was looking
for her husband, who was drunk. . Rlch
ardson'had taken a cure for drunkenness
and she told of ' his quarreling oh "the
street with Fife. The witness shed tears
when she said ;lier â¢. husband -was not
abusive when sober, but- only, when drunk.
She told the same .story .of .the .murder
as she had related at her j own â¢' trial Â¦ a
month ago. V . . : Â¦ >',-;Â¦
James \V. Boyd, the leading counsel for
Fife, then made the -statement-! for his
client. The defense would show.' he said,
that Richardson had - once'asked his wife
to drive Fife down-to: the square; that
when he went to ..North Yakimay' Wash.,,
after the murder, heidid notrcover : up
his whereabouts; that the revolver found
by, the Rickoff. boy was placed there a
long time after th^ murder, and that Fife
was at the Owl Club rooms at the' time
the murder was committed. '_Â¦ : - Â¦Â¦ Â¦- .'Â¦" '
Sheriff Holcomb was recalled ! to-day
and cross-examined about. the finding of
a revolver by Carl Rickoffi in a sewer
yesterday. The State submitted as evi
dence this revolver, with the /statement
that the bullet ' taken from Richardson's
head was of. the same' size- as the. empty
shell found in the revolver. "./" 1>-
The State attorneys previously, asserted
thatythey would prove by this woman
that Fife had made . admissions to her
after the murder of Richardson that
would connect him with the crime. She
wasj/not to be found when the State
called her name two days ago.
SAVANNAH, Mo., \ March . 15.â In the

It is allegVd that much cattle stealing
is being done in the island and that a
nujnber of minor officials are implicated
in the work of the thieves. Investiga
tions into the stealing of cattle in Matan
zas resulted recently in the arrest' of the
Chief of Police and the administrator of
the . slaughter-house. The ; prisoners^ were
subsequently released on bail and the
Mayor of Matanzas reinstated them. Gov
ernor General Wood, however, has for
bidden that they be allowed to perform
the duties of their offices pending their
trial.
"Cuba can produce sugar more cheaply

To Prove What Swamp- Root, the World- Famous Kidney and Bladder Remedy,
Will Do for YOU, Every Reader of The Call May Have a Sample Bottle Free.
Dr. Kilmer & Co.! Bii^haniton, N. Y.:
Gentlemenâ In justice to you I feel it is my duty to send you an acknowledgment of the receipt of the
. sample bottle of Swamp-Rbbt you so kindly sent me. I had been out of health for the past five years with kid-
: : . new and bladder* trouble. . -Had our best physicians prescribe for me. They would relieve me for the time being.
â¢' ; . but the old complaint would in a short time-return again. I sent for a sample bottle of Swamp- Root, and I found
it did me a world of good. ; Since then I have taken eight small bottles .bought at my drugstore, and I consider
r myself perfectly. cured. -It seemed as though my back would break in two after stooping. 'I do not have- the
smarting and irritation; nor do I have to get. up during the night to urinate, as I formerly did three or four
.times a' night, but now sleep the sleep of peace. My back is all right again, and in every way I am a' new man.
Two of my brother officers are still using Swamp-Root. They, like myself, cannot say too much in praise of it.
. .:. It is a boon to mankind. We recommend it to all whd are suffering from kidney and bladder diseases.
; : v My brother officers (whose signatures accompany this letter), as well as myself, thank you for the blessing you
have brought t& the human race in the compounding of Swamp-Root. v JAMES COOK.
: = .. Â¦ /Â¦ V/e remain, yours very truly, HUGH E. BOYLE.
. Â¦; Officers pf the 58th Police Precinct, Greater New York. JOHN J. BODKIN.,
-^i.-. If. you.- are sick or "feel badly." begin ' taking the famous new discovery. Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, because as soon
as your kidneys are well they will help all the other organs to health. A trial will convince any one.
Weak and unhealthy kidneys are responsible for many kinds of diseases, and If permitted to continue much suffering
with fatal results are sure to follow. Kidney trouble Irritates the nerves, makes you dizzy, restless, sleepless and irri-
table., Makes you pass water often during the day and obliges you to get up many times during the night. Unhealthy
kidneys cause rheumatism, gravel, catarrh of the bladder, pain or dull ache in the back, joints and' muscles: makes your
head ache and back ache, causes Indigestion, stomach and liver trouble; you get a sallow, yellow complexion, makes you
feel asthough you had heart trouble; you may have plenty of ambition, but no strength; get weak and waste away.
Â¦ Swamp-Root is pleasant to take and is used In the leading hospitals, recommended by- physicians in their private
. practice, and is taken by doctors them^-lves, because they recognize in it the greatest and most successful remedy that
Â¦ .science has ever been able to compound.
I'j If you are already convinced that Swamp-Root Is what you need, you can purchase the regular fifty-cent and one-
dollar size bottles at the drug stores everywhere. Don't make any mistake, but remember the name, Swamp-Rootâ Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-^Root. and the address. Binghamton. N. Y.. on every bottle. ,

Edmund F. Green, the Pacific Coast

Northwestern Railway men who had in

men.
In explanation Green said that the New
Amsterdam Company had tried to intro
duce a system of insurance among the
Northwestern Railway men similar to
that among the Southern Pacific Rail
way employes. A representative of the
New Amsterdam Company was sent
among the men and succeeded in placing
about seventy policies. Almost as soon
as the men took out their, policies they
commenced to . complain of the condi
tions. The premiums were to be payable
quarterly, and were to be withheld from
the salaries of the men by the railway
paymaster. After the first quarterly pay
ment, had been collected and was in tHef
hands of Green, the company officials in
New York, angered by the complaints
that the men had made, and not under
standing that the premiums were to be
paid "quarterly, decided Â¦to strike the en
tire list off the books; All the policies
were canceled, and this led to the men's
belief that they had been swindled.
According to stories once circulated

FBESIDIO GOLFEBS
TJP AGAINST "BOGEY"
G. B. Cooksey Proves the winner in a
Handicap Tournament on the
San Francisco Links.
The second half of the home-and-home
tournament, over thirty-six holes, be
tween teams representing class. B of the
fan Francisco and Oakland golf clubs
was not played yesterday afternoon on
the Presidio links owing to the misunder
standing which arose betweens Captains
Leonard Chenery and J. O. Cadman. In
stead of completing the match the regular
scheduled event, a . tournament over
eighteen holes, match play, against
"bogey," took place. Twenty players en
tered, G. B. Cooksey winning the first
prize. a mounted claret jug. and
Dr. J. R. Clark carrying off the
eecond trophy â a glass tankard with a
cover. Each contestant received a handi
cap in strokes upon certain holes. The
winner, receiving one stroke upon each
cf five holes, finished one down. The full
details are shown in the table: .Â¦ , ; i '-i.cz
Captain D. J. Rumbaugh, handicap 6;
Dr. C. J. Decker, handicap 6; J. W.
BjroeJ handicap 2, and B. Faymonville,
handicap 16, made no returns. !
To-morrow, begrinning . at 9:S0 . In the
morning, there will be ladies' foursomes,
over eighteen hoies, on the Presidio links.
Another of the alleged white confed
erates of the negro woman, Mattie Ben
nett, was placed in Jail here to-day. His
r.Lr.ie is Joe Hood, and he admits that
he saw Pearson at 10 o'clock on the night
of his disappearance. He also admits that
he knew Mattie Bennett, but he denies
any complicity In either the robberies or
the murders.
The body was buried by the local Paint
ers' Union this afternoon in the midst of
a violent thunder storm that amounted to
almost a cloudburst.
Coroner Brown, however, declares that
KUiclde Is an impossible -theory In view
of the nature of the wounds. One extends
across the right temple from the front of
the skull to the back of the head, the top
cf the ear being lacerated. This wound,
the surgeons say, was necessarily inflict
ed by a broad, heavy instrument. Another
blow had crushed -the victim's Jaw bone,
there was a very unusual bloating and
discoloration about the eyes which is
thought to indicate violence, and there is
what appears to be an immense bruise at
the base of the man's throat.
Fellow boarders declare that on the
night when he was last seen he wa6 called
frura the bathroom and that he was never
Â«een after he went out of the door to
answer the call. Some friends of the
dead man profess to believe that he com
mitted suicide.
The body was that of W. R- Mac-
Namara, a young painter. It was found
near the spot where three of the other j
five victims have been found. Life had j
been crushed out in exactly the same'
manner by blows on the head and face 1
from heavy blunt weapons, and aside
from a union card, a memorandum book
and one or two trinkets not a thing had
been left in the pockets. The man had
been ml&slng since February 26, Just four
day* after the finding of Benjamin Pear
eon's naked body had led the authorities
to suspect murder in the cases of three
previous floaters.
BEAUMONT, Texas. March 16.â Another
of its dead was given up by the Naches
River to-day, and the body Is called that
cf "victim No. 6" of tne MatUe Bennett
gang of robbers and alleged murderers.
Citizens are threatening to dynamite the
river for the purpose of learning all Us
death secrets and proving or disproving
the prevalent theory that others of the
gang's supposed victims lie buried there.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
An Additional Arrest Is Made by the
Authorities in Connection. With
the Mysterious Crimes
at Beaumont.
Remains of a Missing Young
Painter Recovered From
the Neches.
One More Death Is Laid
at Door of the Mattie' }

upon-Occurred to enterprising men that since the canals were already constructed it would
not cost mucK. more to put in the machinery necessary to convert the energy of .the rushing water
into electricity and to apply it to manufacturing purposes. ' In looking round for raw. material to
operate upon the promoters soon noted the value of the spruce forests in the neighborhood and
accordingly the electrical energy, was set to work converting the trees into wood pulp. The success
of the first venture encouraged the undertaking of others. A.second and larger electric plant was
constructed. Further raw material was sought forand'found in the .mineral resources of the
region, and now it is expected that the district ;\vill become one of the largest manufacturing cen
ters on the continent. >
FROM the far-away region where the waters of Lake Superior pour through the rapf3s of
Sault Ste. Marie comes a story of interest to Califqrnians. It shows how the development
of a power for the operation of industry causes industry to rise, and how- raw materials
formerly considered out of; reach of markets are brought into the- commercial world and
made the sources of large profits.

Pupils of a Dancing Academy Pro
duce "Cinderella" With Good
Results.
It was children's day at the Alhambra
Theater yesterday. Little children and
their elders watched the spectacular opera
and patronized the peanut and popcorn
vender during the intermission. The oc
casion was the production of the comic
opera "Cinderella" and an accompanying
exhibition of fancy dances by the pup'ls
of Mr. and Mrs. W. J. O'Brien's dancing
academy.
The large auditorium was crowded and
every one present enjoyed the perform
ance. Those who ' participated In the opera â¢
sustained their parts well and won an
abundance of applause. The dancing spe
cialties were remarkably good. Little tots
executed steps of all nations, and the
show went through without a hitch or a,
mistake. At the end of the programmed
came a Florodora sextet, which was
worthy of special mention.
> Mrs. Caro True-Boardman, who had
coached the children for their parts in
"Cinderella," also had a part in the opera
and gave a specialty that was warmly re
ceived.
CHILD AUTISTS APPEAR

tire mass, each head of this monster of a thou
sand heads, of this Titan of the century whom
I call "Everybody" takes cart In my play. Jt
may be for a flying 1 moment, to utter but one
word, fling: only a single glance. Perhaps his
action in the play consists of a smile, seen
but to vanish. Listless and absent-minded, he
acts without passion, without anger, without
guile, often for mere distraction's sake. .
Don Julian â What then?
Ernest â These light words, fugitive smiles,
all these passim: glances and this petty evil,
that" may be called the insignificant rays of the
dramatic light, condensed to one focus, to one
family, result in conflagration and explosion,
In strife and In victims. If I represent the
whale by a few types or symbolical person
ages. I bestow upon each one that which Â¦ Is
really dispersed among many, and such a re
sult distorts jny idea. Suppose a "few types
upon the stage whose guilt repels and Is the
less natural because In them the evil has no
object. V This exposes me to the accusation , of
the intent to paint a cruel, corrupt and de
based Â«ociet7. when my sole purpose is to
prove that not even the most Insignificant ac
tions are In themselves insignificant, or lcat
for eood or evil.
Don Julian stamps this as metaphysics,
not drama, "a glimmer of light in an In
finitude of cloud," and says that for his
part he wants a love story, an intrigue,
action and effective situations. Ernest
replies that the love- and Jealousy in his
play will be largely subjective, that which
does not come to the surface, but runs
between the lines. Don . Julian sensibly
asks:
"But who. understands all this? How
are these Interior, cataclysms to be sug
gested? Who tells these things to the
audience? In what way are they to be
made evident? Must we spend a whole
evening hunting for an ominous glance,
a fateful sigh, a gesture, aeingle word?
My dear boy, this Is not amusement, ! It
is philosophy."
Ernest stubbornly maintains that it Is
a drama If he could 'only give it fitting
form, and ends with a grand
that It shall be done, and that "so will
he use our. lost words, our vague smiles,
our curious glances and . all those in
numerable trivialiUes that mark our idle
progress through the street, the cafe, the
theater, the reception, and In their ac
cumulated mass make life." In the play
he becomes the victim of the idly con
ceived and idly advanced suspicion of his
honor, "nobody acts with guile, conscious
evil," says the author, his benefactor is
killed, his benefactor's wife flung Into^is
arms and he Is forced into unearned In
famy through, tne fate that Echegary has
here newly personified as "Everybody."

good command of the finger-board. Style
is yet lacking in her performance, finish
and fineness, but there Is a sound and
healthy foundation ' to build upon and
everything to work with.

Kathleen Is now, and has been for two
or three years, a pupil of Henry Holmes.
Before that, time she studied with her
uncle, Mr. Kurnow, and seems to have
been well on the right path ever since her
beginningâ in Canada, by the way. There
is nothing of the abnormal about the
small violinist. She is just a sweet, whole

been a little more" carefully and. sensibly
educated than the average childâ which,
as she is the only one, is maybe not won
derful. Kathleen's puoilc appearance at
this early stage. was hardly In contempla

that way, and the little girl makes her
bow In vaudeville this afternoon. Two of
her numbers will be the "Gipsy Dance" of

"Yankee Doodle.7 and I am sure a warm
welcome p awaits her. I happen to know,
by the way. that the money earned by
the Â¦ budding: Neruda will all be devoted
to her education. I also happen to know
that her schooling of the last two years

I heard her first about a year ago. in some
De Berlot numbers, and she played ever
so well ,then, with a finish, style and
ease that one is not accustomed to look
for in a child's work. She had also a very
sufficient technique, temperamental gifts
of high order, an excellent school, and
there seemed indeed every reason why she
should make her mark in the violin world.
I think she is going to do it, too, for her
work shows amazing progress since last
year.

\f \f been attempting to , determine' 'what the man of the future will be like: in ages far be-
I â¢ -Â¦ v yond those to 'which 'the. Wells, forecast extends. Professor Bruner- does, not rely
upon political economy, nor upon sociology to throw, light upon the issue! : He obtains illumina

conditions of mankind hereafter, he asserts with some. positiveness that the race will be, quite-dif
ferent from what it is to-day. . â¢
The professor begins by declaring that artists fail utterly in their attempts to depict the
anatomy of the primitive, man, because they furnish . him with legs based upon the anatomy of
Greek art. The legs of the Greeks in the days of the great sculptors were better than those of
primitive man, and the legs of the average man of to-day are better than those of men in the days
of Greek art. . The human anatomy is improving: with the years. The brain, the chest and the
lower limbs are alike developing; but there will be some losses. The foot, which the professor
tells us used to be a grasping organ like the foot of an ape and has now become "a mere ambu
latory appendage," will lose one of its toes; the number of ribs will be reduced, the'vermiform ap
pendix will vanish; but on the other hand the man of the future will have more hair and

glimpse of it;
WHEN John Drew brought "The !
Bauble Shop" to San Francisco
some six years ago, among the
extra people engaged for the
local production Â¦was Â¦ a young
and ambitious student of a dramatic
school, who was cast for a "thinking
part." The student "thought" to good
purpose, however, and asked a member
of the company his advice as to the best
way to go about learning to be
an actor. John Drew's associate
strongly advised the stock com
pany, and the student took the advice
and went to the Grand Opera-house,
where he "suped" and played small parts
for a year. At the year's end he again
asked advice of his former mentor, and
was told to go to New York, which he
did. There A. M. Palmer took him on,
first in small parts, and then, as his abil
ity and conscience made themselves felt,
as assistant stage director. From that
to the chief stage manager was & matter
of only a short time, and now the actor
is at the head of his own company. The
ambitious young man is Howard Kyle,
and he comes to-night to the California
Theater as the star performer in "Nathan
Hale." with the original Nat Goodwin
production. Report has all kinds of fa
vorable things to say of Mr. Kyle's con
ception of the part, and the play is said
to be one of the best examples of Clyde
Fitch's facile genius. .
But "Nathan Hale" by no means repre
sents the limit of Mr. Kyle's ambition,
â¢whose kind and quality may be conjec
tured from the fact that if the exigen
cies of the -week permit ho will produce at
one of those matinees in which actors in
dulge their personal liking Jose Echega- Â¦
ray's "El Gran Galeoto." With its mag
nSficent reach, high literary value, Ibsen
like outlook and entire absence of the or
dinary theatrical trickery, this greatest
play of the foremost Spanish dramatist
of the day is not one to attract the actor i
cut out of common stuff. Mr. Kyle's
aspirations may of course outrun his ca
pacitiea, but - at any rate his dramatic
heart Is in the right place, and if we are
lucky enough to get "El Gran Galeoto"
a large gratitude to the actor will be in
order In any case.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The play has been given before In
America, at the Independent Theater in
New Tork three years ago, which place
and time are significant of its kind. -Per*
hups a notion of the scope of the- play
can best be given by quotation from its
prologue that Is sometimes acted, but
mere frequently not. Two of the chief
characters In the drama, Don Julian, 'a
middle-aged, wealthy and practical banker
â¢with a young wife, and Ernest, the young
hero, son of Don Julian's old friend, and
secretary to the banker, in the end driven
t>y cataclysmic force to become the lover
of his benefactor's wife/ appear In the
prologue that Is the playwright's appre
ciation of his own play. Ernest, imprac
tical and a poet, has conceived a wonder
ful Idea for a drama, but Is bewildered
by its bigness, and is discussing the mat
ter with Don Julian, who in the prologue
symbolizes the spirit of "Everybody," to
vhom the play is dedicated. Here la a
glimpse of It; v
Ernest â Imagine the principal personage one
who creates the drama and develops It. who
cives It life and provides the catastrophe, who,
broadly, fills and possesses It, and yet who can
not make his way to the stage.
Den Julian â Is be then so ugly? So repug
nant or bad?
Ernestâ Not bo. Ugly as you and I may be
â not worse. Neither good nor bad, and truly
not repugnant. I am not such a cynic â
neither a misanthrope, nor one so out of love
with life as to fall into an error of that sort.
Den Julian â Then what fs the reason?
Ernestâ The reason. Don Julian. Is that
there is no material room In the scenario for
this personage.
Don Julianâ Holy Virgin! What do you
mean? Is it by chance a mythological drama
with Titans In It?
Ernest â Not at alL It Is modem.
Don Julian â Well, then?
Ernestâ Briefly â It la a question of EVERY
BODY.
Don Julianâ Everybody! You are right.
There is no room for everybody on the stage.
It is an incontrovertible truth that has more
than once been demonstrated.
Ernest â Then you acree with me?
Don Julian â Not entirely. EVERYBODY
may be condensed Into a few types and char
acters. This is matter beyond me. but euch,
I understand, hat been the practice of the
masters.
Ernestâ Yes. But in my case It is to.con
demn me not to write my drama.
Don Julian* â How so?
Ernest â For many reasons , it would be dif
ficult to explain: above all, at this hour.
â¢ Don Julianâ Never mind; ctve me a few.

CLEVER; CHILD VIOLINIST WHO

DURING THE PRESENT WEEK
The House of Commons is said to.be the best dressed assembly in the world and the
House of Representatives the worst. Altogether it. appears that Congress does not make, a good
dress parade showing in the eyes of a critical observer. However, there may be said of all these
things what Mr. Brooks was wise'enough to perceive to be the truth about the free admission â¢ to
the Capitol â the defects of dignity, style and dress "are more than compensated for by the sys
tem that makes them possible." Better democracy even in the rough than any other governmental
or social system the world can show. " >
Within the houses the contrast is marked by. the evident regard for form in- the Commons
and the disregard for it in the ;House. of /Representatives. The /American "Mr. Speaker" wears no
wig nor flowing robe like his British prototype, and the English observer hardly recognizes him
as a. Speaker at all. The clerks, the sergeant-at-arms and the pages in Congress are alike free
from any display of official dress^ and it is. noted .that "the mace"' alone, being inanimate, shows no
loss of dignity." . . . â¢>/. ; .
. The larger freedom of. manners in Gongress than in Parliament strikes the critic as a, point
in which we are inferior to. his countrymen. He says: "Behind the last row of chairs and desks
runs a railing hung with drapery; and between the railing and the wallis a passage opening, on
to the smoking-rooms. Nothing could have made the visitor feel more thoroughly 'at home than
the sight of honorable members lolling in their chairs and smoking. -As they took care to leave tfie
doors of the smoking-room open, that no word of the speeches might be lost, a very pleasant odor
of tobacco was spread throughout the House." / :-:^ ' >:': â¢ "-":'Â¦ /
The divergences from the customs of the Commons which chiefly impressed our visitor
were those growing out of the relation, of the Representatives. to the barber-shop of the House,
and the presence of children on the floor during debate. Of these he says: "From where I sat it
was possible to catch a glimpse of members under the razor, and democracy took on quite a new
significance for me when the colored barber, finding business dull, opened 1 the door, and, stand
ing in his shirtsleeves and barber's apron; half in and half out of his shop, joked with Congress
men and listened to the speeches till they bored Him. But for sheer domesticity the palm must be
given to a phalanx of small boys, the sons ot Congressmen, who sat on their fathers' knees during
the debates. The colored member, I was enraptured to see, brought his- little pickaninny along.
Why not? Some of. these infants, tiring of the paternal lap, would climb into the nearest chair and
there experiment, with its rotary 'mechanism; and the : Congressman to whom the chair belonged,
so far from making any effort to expel the intruder," would- smile a blank smile and walk offfor a
cigar. One urchin came up to the bar of the House with his father' to be sworn in, held up "his
little fist and took the oath of allegiance to the constitution. f And the only comment I heard from
the galleries was an admiring 'Well, isn't that just the cutest. and. cunningest thing you ever saw?*
For my own part I could safely answer that it was." Y&J&.1 â¢ Â¦

SIDNJlYBROOKS^ has contributed to the London Chronicle an interesting study of the
contrasts ; between the House of Representatives and the House of Commons as seen by a
British observer. He notes in the first place [that the. difference is observable even before
. reaching the halls where - the legislators sit. ' To enter Parliaments buildings one must
have credentials and must pass-the scrutiny of a host of officials, but the" Capitol at Washington
is open to all. Any one can enter at will; as Mr. Brooks says, "without respect to age, sex, color,
previous condition of, servitude' or, present condition of clothes." He adds: "At first it somewhat
startles English notions to see some ragged shuffle- of a man whom no second-rate hotel would
have allowed to enter its lobby lounging about the precincts of the National Legislature, but
after a while one begins to feel that his presence is'more than compensated for by the system that
makes it possible."

Last autumn the San Juan courts vio
lated an ' injunction order of the ' United
States Court and .refused to change the
venue v in .an - ejectment suit brought
against Americans. : The News used the
term "high-handed action" in criticizing
the refusal. This offended the dignity of
the native Judges, who under the Span
ish law were not used to press criticisms.
The Judges Instituted the libel suit <vid
also brought other suits on the ground
of further criticism. The latter, which
are still pending, will probably be dis
missed In view of Bird's acquittal to-day.
The matter involved the question whether
the Spanish press law or constitutional
freedom of the press should prevail.
SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, March 15.â
The editor and proprietor .of the San

to-day in the Arecibo District Court of
the charge of criminally libeling the San
Juan District Court , The prosecutor
asked for two months' imprisonment.

Matter Involving Liberty of the
SAN JUAN EDITOR
DECLARED NOT GUILTY
The body was removed to â¢ the Morgue
and an Inquest was commenced.* An ad
journment was taken until Monday, when
the District Attorney will make a formal
charge against the patricide. The evi
dence . thus far shows that no words
passed between father and son before the
latter fired the fatal shot, and it is likely
that . the younger man was prompted to
kill his sire simply because.the latter had
come home In an intoxicated condition. It
Is intimated that a consultation, was held
up stairs by the mother and her two sons
before the shooting occurred. â¢ The mur
derer Is in the custody of Sheriff Llnville.
Oh opening the front door the young
man saw his father standing on the
porch. Without any wordy preliminary
the son aimed at the father's head and
flred. The elder Jarvt . fell with a moan.
Returning to his room the son proceeded
to dress himself and went to police head
quarters, where he made a full confes-
Bion to Chief Hallock. He was cool and
collected and evidently believed he had
done what was right. He expressed the
belief that his father was dead, but of
ficers who were detailed to visit the scene
of the tragedy found that Jarvi was still
alive. The dying man lay where he had
fallen, the wife and a younger son mak
ing no effort to lend him assistance. The
bullet had penetrated the left eye and
pierced the brain, and two hours after the
shooting Jarvi breathed his last, without
having regained consciousness.
At an early hour this morning Gabriel
Jarvi went home. In the house were Mrs.
Jarvi and her sons, asleep on the
upper floor. Jarvi made an effort to gain
admittance to. the house,, but could not
get in. He continued to hammer, on the
door and finally the elder son went down
.stairs. First, however, he went to his
trunk and got a 32-caJlber revolver.
Father- and son were fishermen. The
elder Jarvi was about 60 years of age. His
fondness for liquor had , often caused
trouble in the household.* It is said of him
that while under the influence of liquor
he. had threatened -the lives / of his. wife
and sons and the patricide shows a scar
on his wrist as the result of an encounter
in which the father had attacked him.
Among the temperate Finns the elder
Jarvi bore an unsavory reputation and
the Finnish colony cheerfully excuses the
awful crime.
ASTORIA, Or., March 15.â Mattson Jar
vl, aged 32, shot and killed his j father,
Gabriel Jarvi, this morning, because the
latter had . come home intoxicated. The
son seems absolutely Indifferent as to the
enormity of his crime, and his mother is
likewise apparently satisfied that he did
his duty. Â¦

Minor followred the reading with a state
ment denour^ing the article as absolute
ly and unqualifiedly false. Never by -act,
word, deed or Intimation, he said, had the
Speaker attempted to change Minor's po
sition relative to the â¢ Cuban question.
Speaker Henderson added that so far as
the article referred to him, the averments
made by Minor were absolutely true, as
there was not a word or shadow of truth
in any statement made in it. Immediately
following this incident the House, at 3:30
p. m., adjourned. .
Minor of Wisconsin then* rose to a ques
tion of personal privilege. He sent to
the clerk's desk and had read a Washing
ton dispatch in a Cincinnati newspaper to
the effect that he. Minor, had changed his
position on the shipping bill and on the
Cuban tariff questions because of the
Speaker's - intention to. advance a local
revenue cutter measure in which Wiscon
sin is Interested. -
The House then went into committee of
the whole and entered upon the considera
tion of private pension bills. A message
from the President was received return
ing the bill restoring Edward Kirschner
to the navy, for technical correction.
Richardson said that while he would
have preferred, the reports called for in
his original resolution, he would be satis
fied with the substitute if it elicited the
facts, as he was assured it would. The
resolution was adopted without division.
Parker explained that the reports were
necessarily confidential anfl contained, in
many cases, freely expressed opinions,
which' it. might be unwise to make public.
AH Congress desired or was entitled to,
he said, was the facts.
AVhen the House met Parker of New
Jersey reported back from the Commit
tee on Military Affairs the resolution In
troduced by Richardson, the Democratic
leader,, a few ; days ago, calling upon the
Secretary of War for the reports of cer
tain army officers who examined into the
transport service between San Francisco
and Manila, with a recommendation that
a substitute be adopted which calls for
the j facts relative to this transport ser
vice instead of the reports.- .,
Late in the day Minor of Wisconsin,
rising to a question of personal privilege,
denounced a published statement regard
ing 'the Speaker and himself as false.
Speaker Henderson also stated. that there
was not a shadow of truth in the article.
Earlier, in _ the "day a resolution ' was
adopted calling upon j the War Depart
ment for information concerning the Gov
ernment transport , service Detween San
Francisco and the Philippines.

Governor. Hunt, and hi % party, who have

self as delighted with his trip and as be
ing _ particularly gratified with the excel
lent spirit of the people and the generous,
enthusiastic reception accorded the party.
Everywhere the party stopped banquets,
balls and other entertainments were given
in their- honor. The Governor says he
did not see many idle persons. He also
says the crop of -sugar in the island is
heavy .and the coffee crop satisfactory,
and that in another year these crops will
reach a normal condition. New tobacco
fields are visible on all sides.
The; health of the people is good, the
Governor says, and the inhabitants ap
pear: more thlrfty than at any time in

The main impression gained by Gov
ernor Hunt is that the responsibilities of
government are better appreciated. It is
wonderful, he says, what appreciation
there -is now among the people of the
.tremendous power to . make their own
laws. Less bitterness is shown in indi

RENO, March 15.â A duel was fought in
Purdy this morning at 10:30 o'clock with
rifles j at 'short range, and both . contest
ants are dead. The quarrel was over a
trifleâ a bit of ground worth no more
than ! the powder . the fighters burned in
killing, each other.
.The principals in, the duel were A. A.
Smith and Reese : Evans. Â¦ The former was
commonly known as "Brundage" Smith
and lived in the country north Of Reno
for "many .years. -He was a well-known
character. The other duelist was a mere
bby, a son of the late David Evans, who
once: kept the Antelope 'station.
For .the past year the two had been
quarreling over; a little strip of ground.
Fences' were torn down and re-erected.
The quarrel culminated this morning,
when .Evans â¢'.' went ; to . Smith's cabin,
armed with a Winchester. Smith had a
similar weapon, and after a brief dispute'
both began shooting.
Each man is said to have emptied the
magazine in' his rifle. "â¢ Although they were
at close range nearly all the shots went,
wild. These probably were the ones fired
after the men were fir"st wounded.
.Smith was; shot twice through the body
and had one arm shattered. He lived only,
a few minutes. Evans received a ball
through his left lung. Word was sent lo
Reno and â¢ Drs. Woods and Lewis went
out; Evans had lost so 1 much blood that
it was impossible to bring him to town.
He; died at 9:30 o'clock to-night.
Both of .the fighters were well known in.
Reno and each had a number of friends. N

RAISE THE BARS
ON IMMIGRANTS
There was a little flurry * this morning
among the striking 'men when, upon: re
turning to their old offices,, they found
that at present their services -were not
required. ;, The men rushed back, to , their
headquarters and for a. while Indulged' In
debate, but the counsel of leaders j pre- ;
vailed and the men decided to be patient. |
The day closed with a feeling of relief i
that the worst was over and that Mon- j
day would see a general resumption of j
business. .' -;Â¦..' i
The lumber yards, however,' continued
closed, 'and those old men who .sought
their places found themselves locked out.
Th~e dealers, however, announced that the
yards would open again Monday and that
pearly ail the men will be taken back in
accordance with the Governor's sugges
tion. '. . T' .
This was also acceptable to the labor
organizations, and this afternoon the men
began to report for duty. The fact that
the general teamsters were at work made
it imperative that the railroads J should
complete their laboring forces, as a great
amount of merchandise is now being col
lected all over the city and hauled .to the
freighthouses. All the coal teamsters
were at work again to-day, as well as
the piano-movers and the woolhandlers.
The work of reinstatement) which,
through the efforts of the Governor, be
gan yesterday, continued td-day.'but in a
greater degree.' Of the â¢ 800 men of tfcc
.Bostor. and -Maine ..road, who strurtt
Wednesday, 750 were offered their^ old" po
sitions by President 'Tuttle this morning,
and â¢ he also stated that the remainder
would be taken care of in a short time.
The same disposition was shown at the
licston and Albany offices, where ar
rangements were made to take back, the
eld men at their former wages and at the
same Ume have their work in no way con
flict with the new men, who 'are all non
union.
"The strike condition continues to im
prove. The coal people are working, with
few exceptions. The Clyde Steamship
Company will take back all its men as
soon as the ships arrive. One is expected
to-morrow. \ The Metropolitan Steamship
Company has fifty-four of their men : at
wcrk and will take many, more later.
Nine-tenths of the general teamsters are
at work." . â¢ '. * ;
To add to the general satisfaction over
the labor situation in Boston came the,
word late this afternoon that another
labor war in the mills of Fall IttveV had
been averted, so that the week closed
with something like peace in the old Bay
State. Â¦'Â¦ . : . Â¦-Â¦-.Â¦
Much to the satisfaction of the business
community, freight began, to move to-day
end much work was accomplished 1 in re
lieving the congestion of freight at' the
different distributing points. The State
Board of Arbitration at 3 p. m. issued the
following statement:. .
BOSTON, March 15.â The labor . situa
tion in this city, after a' week of agita
tion and anxiety, is gradually assuming
a normal condition and at the close of
business to-day the great majority of the
freight handlers, teamsters and express
men who Joined, out of sympathy the
strike of the freight handlers of the New
York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad
on Wednesday and Thursday had returned
to work. As ' '. announced r by? Governor
Crane just before leaving the State House
to-night, the disposition of all parties is
to allow a reasonable time. to adjust mat
ters, and in th"e" meantime to be patient.

"But this paper has. never hesitated and
never will hesitate, in the face of any
and all opposition and threats, to battle
with all its vigor agrainst the infamous
doctrines put forth by such 'labor lead

lessly un-American and as anarchistic as
any promulgated during the Reign of
Terror.
"Peter C. Yorke has done so much for
labor! '
"Who will not knuckle down to Peter C.
Yorke is in his eyes all that is vilely ir
religious. And any one who refuses to
see ln this man cither a Peter the Hermit

"The true friend to labor Is not tho man
nor the Journal that Is continually pat

errjrs and wrongs It may be led by hot

abusive talk could be scattered broadcast
among the Catholics of California immc

"Bah! A contempt for Peter C. Yorke
almost argues a respect for religion.
"And the insult was premeditated and
carefully planned on the part of Rev. Pe

he was working.
"He waited until a few days before elec

his antagonist, one of deep interest, not
only to political and clerical circles, but to
the community at large. The Rev. Peter

editor of the Evening Bee of Sacramento,
have locked horns. On the 12th InsL, un
der the heading of "The Genesis of Rev
erend Peter C. Yorke â Likewise Some of
His Revelations," McClatchy wrote as fol
lows:
"The Â¦writer feels it a duty to apologize
to the readers for the publication in yes

gar personal attack by Rev. Peter C
Yorke. and promises the offense shall not
be repeated in these columns. The object
of that and a similar publication was to

In the vulgar onslaught has he a word to
say: He has never at any time nor under
any circumstances Insulted any religion

every religion with courtesy and respect.
And that is far more than Peter C. Yorke
can say for himself. The latter has never
publicly uttered one decent word of any
religion save his own or of any minister
not a professor of the Catholic creed. On
the contrary, his language concerning any
other faith or any minister denying alle

would not be tolerated in any decent

Friend Told Him to Change His Food
i " '
' ' OneÂ© In a while one can serve a friend
and win a llfe-lonz obligation by a little
food advice. This Is worth while. "Very
thankful I was to a friend for his advice
when he told 'me about Grape-Nuts
Breakfast Food at the time I was suffer-
ing. My stomach trouble originally
came from neglect of colds which caused
c&tarrh of the stomach, then followed
mifccry from dyspepsia, headache, loss of
vitality and flesh. .
Last August a frlc-nd in discussing my
health said If I would change my food
and take Grape-Nuts Instead of any
other food or medicine for one week he
would guarantee that I would be greatly
Improved and feel like a new man.
"He wat so positive that I concluded to
try it and, as I said, I am exceedingly
thankful to him. In a week's time I lost
the heavy, dead feeling ln my head, nau-
sea had ceased and the action of my gen-
eral system had greatly improved.-
"I have stuck fast to Grape-Nuts. Now
I weigh nine pounds more and am stead-
ily improving. Grape-Nuts has a most
exhilarating effect on the system 1 and
makes one feel bright and alive, as
though they were well nourished as a
healthy man should be.
.' "The price of Grape-Nuts is within
'. reach of all, but I consider it worth its
weight in gold." John Haywood, 3931

The Reason Why Inhlers and Local

For many year* catarrh van considered to
be a local dlieeatse nnd waa treated entirely ],,â¢
local remedle*. Halves, ointment*, powders,
Â¦prays and lnhulem. und nearly all of tlie.Ho
iruve a, temporary relief, but a genuine perma-
nent curu waa very rare.
It Ii true tho most nnnoylnir nymtitonu, like

tho real Â«eat of disease Is for removed â¢<
Catarrh U a conittltutlonal 'dlioane., .'Â» 'blood
dlnorder. complicated usually with disease * of
tho liver, nnd to auppose that, local applications
of sprays, powder*. Inhalers.' could ever reach
tho real cause of tho trouble Is ridiculous.
The sensible and successful treatment" Is to
removo the caterrhal poison from tho aystcm
by regulating the liver and purifying; tho blood
and this can only be done by an Internal rem-
edy, which should consist of antiseptics and
remedies to act vigorously on the blood and
liver. ' Â¦ . -v.
The bent preparation of this kind which fills
all the requirement* of a safe Â¦ constitutional
treatment Is Stuart's Catarrh Tablets, com-
posed of Dlood Hoot, Red Gum and similar
wholesome antiseptics, which - are absolutely
safe to take Into the stomach and which act
upon the liver, stomach and mucous mem-
brane. . â¢ '
Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are large pleasant
tasting lozenges, to be slowly dissolved ln the
mouth, thus reaching the mucous membrane
and wind-pipe and finally reaching the stom-
ach. -

treatment for catarrh, says : "I. have accom-
plished, the most satisfactory results in' all
forms of catarrh of the head, throat, bronchial
tubes, as well as catarrh of the stomach and
liver, by using nothing else but Stuart's Ca-
tarrh Tablets., I long since threw aside sprays
and Inhalers as being Inconvenient and at the
best mero temporary make-shifts.
"Stuart's Catarrh Tablets act Immediately
â¢upon the liver and blood, nnd clear. the; wholo
system of catarrhal poison. They are, pleasant
and very convenient to use. and they are not
only the "latest, but Â¦Â¦ I belieVe them to be " the

Will Enjoy Outing.
Among the prominent soloists of the
tabernacle choir who will be heard to-day
are Mrs. Lizzie Thomas Edward and
Luella Ferrin, sopranos; Mabel Cooper
and Judith Anderson, contraltos; Fred
Graham, tenor, and John Robinson, bary
tone. In addition there will be thirty
tenors, forty-five sopranos, thirty-five
contraltos and thirty-five bassos.
The choir had looksd forward to singing
at Golden Gate Park with the park band,
but as that organization of musicians has
disbanded the idea had to be given up.
The services at Metropolitan TempiÂ©
Â¦will be conducted by Dr. J. E. Talmage,
one of the speakers -of- the Mormon
church, and the two organists of tho
famous Tabernacle at Salt Lake iClty, J.
J. McClellan and Joseph J. Daynes, will
preside at the organ.
Had It been possible for even half the
members of the tabernacle choir to ac
company him there would have been sev
eral concerts given in the State, but as It
is the 150 voices, certainly a goodly num
ber, will be heard in the city only at Met
ropolitan Temple at .10 o'clock this morn
ing and "at 8 o'clock, this evening at re
ligious services. . -
All Could Not Come.
A part of the church choir of the Mor
mon Tabernacle, numbering 150, together
with 400 friends, Mormons and people of
other denominations, from Utah,, Idaho
and Wyoming, arrived on special South
ern Pacific trains last evening. They ar
rived several hours late but In the best
of spirits and all delighted to set their
feet firmly on California soil, for It has
been a long-looked-for pleasure to make
the trip to this city. To Professor Evan
Stephens, who for many years has direct
ed the choir and brought it to its present
numerical strength, is due the tour of the
choristers, and if he had had his way the
whole 550 members, the biggest church
choir in the world, would have been on
the train under his guidance.
The visit Is solely due to the admiration
Professor Stephens holds for the State of
California. He loves every Inch of the
ground, and for that reason he made up
his party,, planned the tour and as
sured 1 those who had never before visited
the State that there was nothing ! more
beautiful in the world to see.

TACOMA. March 15. â Arrangements
have been perfected for merging Into one
organization the Pacific Coast Lumber
Menufacturers' Association, the Washing
ton Lumbermen's Association and the
Southwest Washington Lumber Manufac
turers' Association. The project .will be
carried Into effect et a meeting of the Pa
cific Coast Association In Tacoma next
week. The merger will give Washington
lumbermen the most powerful organiza
tion they have ever had and will ena.ble
them to better protect their Interests. The
combination will be followed by an im
xrediate advance in prices on all grades
cf fir lumber. The minimum increase will
be DO cents per 1000 feet.
There Is an unusually strong demand
for lumber and all of the mills are busy.
Xx>gs and labor are nigh and general con
filUons show that the lumbermen . feel
that they are entitled to somewhat higher
prices.
Prices for shingles also are likely to be
advanced. ' "The manufacturers claim
that the profits are now very small In
consequence of a scarcity of cedar logs
&nd the stiff price* at which they are held.
Shingle brokers have been endeavoring
unsuccessfully to break the market, but
the disposition of the manufacturers is
toward firmer prices. They are even will-
Ing to temporarily close the mills until
all surplus stocks are sold.
There Is a piece of 'gossip in the Na
tional Guard at this time that is agitat
ing the rank of that organization, which
is to the effect that Governor Gage, the
commander In chief, who is seeking a re
nomlnation for the office of Governor,
has In contemplation the appointment of
three brigadier generals to succeed War
field, Last and Mueller, with the Idea, Â»o
it is suggested, that by so doing he will
Increase his chances for the nomination.
The event In the National Guard of Cali
fornia during the current month will be
the banquet to be tendered on the even-
Ing of the 29th to Adjutant General Stone
and stall in the Occidental Hotel by Ma
jor General John H. Dickinson and all
the commissioned officers of the guard in
tho State. It Is expected that this will be
the greatest gathering of National Guaro
officers that has ever been held in this
city, for from indications â¢ there will be
representatives from every section, of the
State where there Is an organization of
the guard.
During the current month there will be
two battalion drills. by the companies of
tba FIr6t Infantry on Van Ness avenue
about the time of the full moon./ 7"
Arrangements are being made for a la
dies' night at the armory of the First In
fantry. A committee has been appointed
to make all the arrangements for that
event. '-., -' : . .

ant in the Seventh California Volunteers,
was elected eecond lieutenant.

School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
The recent order for muster and Inspec
tion of the several organizations of the
Second Brigade is to the effect that Brig
ade Inspector Napthaly shall inspect all
but the four companies composing the
First Artillery Battalion. As to that part
cf the brigade a special inspector is to be
selected. The officers who are interested
hi the brigade are wondering why the
brigado Inspector has-been ."cut out" as
to the artillery, which drills as infantry,
and they are asking one another, "Is It
possible that he cannot inspect artillery
men who are drilling as infantry?" and
tfce reply generally given is, "If he cannot
inspect such an organization he certainly
cannot inspect other organizations that
drill In the same tactics." But It is said
that that is not the solution, and It is
hinted that there are some personal rea
sons in the battalion why the brigade in
spector should not inspect. The parties
most Interested decline to discusss the
matter. They say they obey orders.

PROP. THO3. F. ADKIX^
President at Uie Institute of Physicians and
Surgeons.
In all parts of the country men and women,
doctors and surgeons, clergymen and educa*
tors, are wondering at the remarkable cures
made by Prof. Thomas F. Adkin. discoverer of.
the Adkin Vitaopathlc treatment.
Prof. Adkin heals not by drugs, nor by Chris-
tian Science, nor by Osteopathy, nor by Hyp-?
notism, nor by Divine Healing, but by a subtle
psychic force of nature In combination wltb
certain vital magnetic remediea which contain
the very elements of life and ntuin.
A reporter recently talked with ITof. Adkin
! and was asked to invite all readers of this
i paper who are sick or who are worried by tha
1113 of those dear to them to write to him for
assistance. "Some people have declared," said
Prof. Adkin. "that my powers are of God; they
' call me a Divine Healer, a man of mysteriuuj
1 powers. This is not so. I cure because 1 un-
derstand nature, because I use a subtle force
of nature to build up the system and restore
health. But, at the same time, I believe that
the Creator would not have given me the op-
portunity to make the discoveries I have mado
nor the ability to develop them if He had not
intended that I should use them for the sood
of humanity. I therefore feel that It Is my
duty to give the benefit of the science I practice
to all who are suffering. I want you to tell
your readers that they can write to me tn the
strictest confidence If they are troubled with
any kind of disease, and I will thoroughly
diagnose their, cases and prescribe a simple
home treatment which I positively guarantee
to effect a complete cure, absolutely free of
charge. I care not how serious their cases
nor how hopeless they may seem. I want them
to write to me and let me make them well. X
feel thai this is my life's work."
So great is the sensation wrought in. thÂ»
medical world by the wonderful cures per-
formed by Prof. Adkin that several professional
gentlemen were asked to Investigate the cures.
Among theso gentlemen were Dr. L. B. Haw-
ley and Dr. S. Dutton "Whitney, both famous
physicians and surgeons. After a thorough
and painstaking Investigation these eminent
physicians were so astounded at the far-reach-
ing powers of Prof. Adkin and the wonderful, '
efticacy of Vitaopathy that they volunteered to I
forsake all other ties in life and all other kinds
of treatment and devote themselves to assist-
ing Prof. Adkin in his great work for human-
ity. With the discovery of the Adkin Vltao-
pathic treatment eminent physicians are gener-
ally agreed that the treatment of disease has
at last been reduced to an exact science.
In all some 8000 men and women have been
cured by the powers of Prof. Adktn. Soma
were blind, some were lame, some were deaf,
some were paralytics scarcely able to move,
so great was their infirmity. Others were af-
flicted with Brlght'a disease, heart disease,
consumption and other so-called Incurable dis-
eases. Some were -sufferers from kidney
trouble, dyspepsia, nervous debility, insomnia,
neuralgia, constipation, rheumatism, female
troubles and other . similar Ills. Soma were
men and women addicted to drunkenness, mor-
phine and other evil habits. In all cases Prof.
Adkin treats he guarantees a cure. Even those
on the brink of the grave, with all hope of re-
covery gone and despaired of by doctors and
friends alike, have been restored to perfect
health -by the force of Vitaopathy and Prof*
Adkln's marvelous skill. And. remarkable as
It may seem, distance has made no difference.
Those living far away have been cured in tha
privacy of their own homes, as well as thos*
who have been treated In person. Prof. Adkin
asserts that he can cure any one at any dis-
tance as well as though^he stood before them.
Not long ago John 4dams of Blakesbury,
la., who had been lame for twenty years, waa
permanently cured by Prof. Adkin without an
operation of way kind. About the same time*
the city of Rochester. N. Y., was startled by
the cure of one of Its oldest residents. Mr. P..
A, Wright, who had been partly blind for at
long period. John E. N'eff of Allllerstaurg, Pa., V
who had suffered for years Â¦ from, a cataract 1
over, his left eye, was speedily restored to per*"^
feet 'sight without an operation. From U>~j

~THE STARVATION PLAN
Of Treating Dyspepsia a^d Stomach'TroaWes
Is Useless and Unscientific.
The almost certain failure of the starvation
cure for dyspepsia has been proven time and
again, but even now a course of dieting Is gen-
erally the first thing recommended for a case
of Indigestion or any stomach trouble.
Many people with weak digestion, as well as
some physicians, consider tha first step to take
In attempting to cure Indigestion la to restrict
the diet," either, by selecting certain foods and
rejecting others or to cut down tho amount of
food eaten to barely enough' to keep eoul and
body together. In other words thÂ« starvation
plan Is by many supposed to be the first ea-
â¢entlal.
All this Is radically wrong. It Is foolish and
unscientific to rtcommend dieting to a man al-
ready suffering from starvation becuuse In-
digestion Itself starves every organ, nerve ana

Catarrh has become such a common
disease that a person entire] j free from
tHs disgusting complaint is seldom met
with. It is customary to speak of Catarrh
as nothing more serious than a bad cold,
a simple inflammation of the nose and
throat. It is, in fact, a complicated and
very dangerous disease ; if not at first, it
very soon becomes so.
The blood is quickly contaminated by
the foul secretions, and the poison through
the general circulation is carried to all
parts of the system. "
Salves, washes and sprays are unsatis-
factory and disappointing, because they do
not reach the seat of the trouble. S. S. S.
does. It cleanses the blood of the poison
and eliminates from the system ail catar-
rba1 secretions, and thus cures thoroughly
and permanently the worst cases.

formed them that dinner was ready, and
they said she could stay.

served the toup anil was preparing to

of experiences in the blockading -fleet, engage
ments with. fort*. and batteries in Charlestown
harbor and of the capture of Georgetown. But
to tell, you of these things would call for the
relation, of deeds of personal â¢ valor. There the

Rear Admiral Henry.' Glass, U.S. N., was
the guest of honor at a banquet given last
evening in the rooms.of the San Francis
co Club by the Society o* American Wars,
Commanderj': of California. The affair
was a delightful one. Decorations of flags
and-flowers covered the, tables and chan
deMers. Music was furnished' by an or
chestra" stationed in an; adjoining room.
Archibald Treat opened the. speechmaking
by paying a . tribute to the guest of the
evening. In part he said:
In the precincts counted yesterdayâ the
Twelfth of the Thirty-third, Third and
Fourth of the Twenty-eighth, Fifth .of
the Twenty-ninth, Eighth of ; the Thirty
first and Twelfth of the Thirty-sixthâ
the losses sustained by the eight contest
ants were as follows: -- *
Alpers 14, Bent in. Egrgers IS. Wilson 18.
Corhlan 24, Keagan 23. Walsh 25 and Finn 22.

In the six precincts counted yesterday
in Judge Murasky's court the .heaviest
losses were sustained by the Labor, can
didates. There . are still slxty.-s.e.ven . pre
cincts to count. The 236 precincts count
ed <eo far leave Walsh 336 votes ahead of
Alpers, Coghlan 22 ahead 'of Eggers; Bent
S4o ahead of Reagan and Wilson 627
ahead of Finn. It is expected .that as the
recount progresses the leads of * Bent
and Wilson will be Increased, while those
cf Walsh and Coghlan win be lessened:
This is due to the fact that most of the
precincts now being counted are located
south of Market street, where* the ma
jority of the ballots were cast for the
Labor party candidates. In consequence
of this the throwing out of a ballot will
reduce the number of votes cast for
Walsh, Coghlan, Finn and Reagan.

,! The Monticello Club selected candidates
l.as.t night from' which officers for the en
suing year, wiir be chosen a, week from
next Saturday night. As befits a political
club inwhich the social features are made
particularly prominent, a pool tourna
ment had the right of way, and not until
u was, seen' that the players were too
evenly^ matched to linisn before the mid
dle of next week did the serious work of
the evening . begin.'
; Louis H.Mooser, the club's financial
secretary,-, in trying to keep run of the
pool tournament got points- and votes sad
ly mixed, and former Public Administra
tor Patrick Boland, with the * old habit
strong ; upon him , insisted that something
was being held out;. for points and balls
in his match did not - correspond. Mean
while T. Carl Spelling played a thoughful
game of billiards â¢ by himself, occasionally
striking, some of the attitudes that were
part of the show features of Sacramento
during the last session of the Legislature.
Â¦ i Supervisor James P. Booth finally called
the members to order. During his presi
dency the club has occupied Its cozy new
quarters - at 23 Kearny street, has paid
off an indebtedness of $1500, and has grown
from a; membership of 150 to nearly 400,
including J prominent Democrats j all over
the State. Booth; was strongly urged to
take, the office for another term, but de
clined, and later in the evening his nom
ination for a directorship was enthusias
tically applauded, but he declined that
honor also; on account of the pressure of
other duties. :. - I

j Intelligence comes from the -south that
the . sentiment against boss rule to State
affairs is . active. Indications are that
Preston and .Flint will gain amajority of
the delegates south of Tehachapl." In the
northern end of the State Preston will win
a goodly number of delegates. It may be
regarded as settled that. the State conven
tion will be held at" Sacramento. Los An
geles does not r seem to care for.conven
tion honors. The people are too busily
engaged in developing the resources of the
south and tapping the developed resources
of the tourist to give much time to" poli
tics. THeir chie/ desire Is that the Re
publicans shall. nominate a candidate for
Governor other, than Gage, Flint clubs
have been organized a s rallying points
for the anti-boss Republicans. If the
sentiment north ( should j incline toward
Preston or Pardee the delegates : would
readily join- the strongest anti-machine
column. â¢ '" ' Â¦" ;. '. -\ .' ,'- .-<
At a late. hour last evening Governor
Gage, also announced that he had ap
pointed the ; following members of the
State Mining Bureau: W. C. . Ralston,
Thomas B. Bishop and R; Q.- Drum of
San Francisco, and F. A. Harvey of Sac
ramento. .. " ,\ . .â¢: Â¦';: " .
The Governor yesterday appointed two
Yosemite Valley Commissionersâ John C.
Wilson of. San Francisco and Thomas A.
Hender of Tuolumne. Mr. , Wilson is *t
leading coal merchant of this city and is
well known ; in commercial clubs and so
ciety circles. Mr7 Hender is a resident of
Sonora, Tuolumne County. The Governor
also appointed- James W. Rea, George Y
Bollinger, P. B.^ Chamberlain, Harry P.
Moore and Charles Dunphy to the agri
cultural district board of Santa Clara and
San Mateo counties. . \
Yosemite Commissioners.
It is well understood that E. F. Preston
is on the best of. terms with Colonel Kirk
patrick of the Harbor Commission, and no
one doubts but that Paris Kilburn, presi
dent of the board. Is a friend of Thomas
Flint. Morecrver. Colonel Kirkpatrick, as
manager of the Sharon estate, will think
twice before he Renters into a combine
against Kilburn: when he ascertains that
Preston and Flint have interests In Ne
vada that will enable them to make re
prisals on Frank G. Newlands. whose'am
bition. is to,: represent that State in the
United States Senate.
Workers in" the" cause of anti-boss rule
redoubled their efforts and it soon became
known to Burns, Herrin and Gage .that
Mackenzie needed help. In order. to ren
der himf timely assistance they gave him
the job. of Harbor Commissioner. : Asa
matter of fact : Kilburn, Kirkpatrick and
Herold had given out the patronage for
this year, and Mackenzie will have "noth
ing but 1 gold bricks to proffer until ; this
time next season. He may be able to fool
seme of the "push" of Santa Clara Coun
ty with, the notion that all the men work
ing in the prune orchards can get employ
ment on the water front of San Francisco
immediately after the fruit Is gathered,
but the wise one's will demand places be
fore the harvesty Gage and Johnny Mac
kenziemay, not know.it, but it is a fact,
nevertheless,^ that ; the â¢ gold brick Â¦ game
was overplayed in the Senatorial contest
at | Sacramento, and [ Santa Clara Cdunty
contributed its full quota of victims.
Johnny Mackenzie will have the strenu
ous time of his experience in standing off
the place hunters. The task of control
ling his associates on the board will not
be easy. . " * ; \
',' Governor Gage commissioned John D.

ve'yinerÂ». the announcement that the Go v

: It gives me much pleasure' to recommend to
the publjf Mr. George Mayerle of 10T1: Market
street," San' Francisco, strictly as a skillful and
expert -optician. Â¦- My sight began to fail 'In
1877, twenty-flve years ago, . and since that
Inie I have been wearing glasses.fl consulted
a prominent optician in Chicago, Dr. Holmes.
At different times since. that I have had lenses
fitted on In St. Louis, Cleveland, Ohio, and
also tried. the. Flfth-avenua opticians in Pitts-
burg, who claim to be among the best In their
line in the country. I do not hesitate to say
that I have met with better and more satis-
factory results with Mr. Mayerle than with
any of the above named, who have much higher
pretensions. Respectfully,

Mrs. Levy had been sick for a long time.
She had been an inmate of a sanitarium
a few weeks ago and a surgical operation

A large platform was erected for the
I use of the military bands, and tastefully
cecorated lunch tables were set, Hhe ta

local Red Cross Society.
The reception opened at 3 p. m., and un

Llusic was furnished by the Third Ar
tillery band from the Presidio and the

drill by fifty of the naval aprentices,
Pressed in full uniform and carrying 1
urns.
Mrs. W. B. Harrington, president of the
Etate Red Cross Society, and Mrs. John
F. Merrill, president of the San Francisco
branch, were assisted by a large number
cÂ£ ladles In receiving: the visitors. Briga

port service was the guest of honor of the
eociety, and many officers from the Pre
ridio and other military and naval sta

Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz delivered a
chort address, and he was given a hearty
reception by those present when he was
escorted by Mrs. Harrington and Mrs.
Merrill to the platform.
In introducing the Mayor Mrs. Harring
ton said: "Ladles and GentlemenâAl
though the ladles are In the majority this
afternoon, we are indebted to the gentle
men who have so loyally etood by /us In
our work of help for. the soldiers. It Is
Â¦with great pleasure that I introduce to
you Mayor Schmitz, who has kindly con
eented to address us." . â¢ . .
Mayor Schmitz spoke as follows: La
dies ani Gentlemen â I have been request-'
cd to say a few words to the T.ed Cross
Eociety, and it affords me the greatest
pleasure to do so and say a few words of
praise to you for the noble work In which
you have been engaged. In two years
this society collected 5180.000 for' the sick
soldiers, and the work of the society has
attracted the attention of the whole
â¢world. The work of the Red Cross So
ciety is a sublime one. We are too prono
to recognize In victory the achievements
of our soldiers and sailors, but their valor
Is paralleled by the efforts of our Ameri
can women. The work of giving aid "to
our Bick soldiers will ever stand as a
bright star in the glorious records of our
country. I trust that the -country will
r.ot again need their noble . services, and
that we may ever enjoy peace and pros
perity."

THE INJURED.
After more than an hour's hard work
both ..tracks were cleared. "While the
blockade lasted the Ellls-atreet cars were
sÂ£nt out over" the Eddy-street line.
Peter D. Hennessey, who was a pas
senger on car 562, says that it was the
carelessness of the gripman and conductor
of car 54 In leaving their car on the grado
on Jones street that caused the second
accident. He said: "When -I first saw
the car the men were trying to catch the
cable. It -suddenly started off and cams
down the hill and . bumped Into us. I
Jumped in time to save myself, but tha
others did not seem to realize the dan

Jones-street cars- are run the accident la
due, It is claimed.
. Car 54. was in & very dilapidated condi
tion. ' The roof and rail around the plat
form wero . demolished, the grip broken
and every pane of glass in it was shat
tered. Car 653 came out of tho collision
with slight injuries, but car 582 was forced
to go to the car shed for repairs. It was
damaged nearly as mucn as car 54.
Much Damage Is Done.
Disbrow says he had no warning of tha
disaster. He was standing near where
Harvey, was sitting and was struck by
the car. His ear was cut and he felt a
soreness in his shoulder. When he wa3

to-day no longer debatable. : The question before
this court is whether the Board of Â¦ Supervisors
can legally prohibit burials i within; the limits
of San Francisco. '.Can It be denied that if a
cemetery were Â¦ located . anywhere north of Ful
ton and Market (streets the -Supervisors, repre
senting the. wishes, and desires, of the : people,'
would have power to remove the same?. I main

ties' relative to .the subject, and oh his an
nouncement \ that? It i would ' be \ Impossible '
for him to* complete his 'argument during.
the v day', an 1 adjournment: was taken 4 until
next Friday afternoon.^ ;
McEnerney* cited many : authorities In
support of -his contention.- <. He' insisted
that there was a vast and Important;dif
ference between the terra to regulate and
regulation itself.' To. regulate was one
thing.'but regulation "was widely, different.
Thus a municipal regulation" may be of
such a character as ' to j prohibit the per
formance "of .'certain -acts, 'and. not merely
regulate them: : The. police: power of San
Francisco i was not limited to . the j regula
tion of .nuisances perse or of nuisances of
any, description whatsoever. ; The regula
tion of cemeteries was a 1 reasonable exer
cise of police power, and the speaker con
tended that' there were .'authorities up
holding that view. : Resuming he said: . Â¦
Attorney. McEnerney. followed; with a
strong argument in- defense of the ordin
ance. He contended that every munici
pality In California had the same right to
exercise police powers within Its territory
as has a sovereign State. If.lt was.con
ceded by. the other side that the Legisla
ture had power to enact a law. prohibiting
the burial of Â¦ people, then a municipality
like San Francisco " had . the same power.
Before the adoption of the constitution of
1879 municipalities were granted certain
powers by -the Legislature, but since that
time the' municipalities were free to'exer
cise of their own volition the powers
formerly j conferred â¢ upon them by the
Legislature...
Power, of Municipalities.
"This ordinance is void because.it unjustly,im
poses upon adjoining counties the duty of bury
â¢ing the dead of San Francisco. If San Mateo.,
Marln ; and ; Alameda ' counties â¢ were i to , enact
similar laws, â¢ what would become of ' the dead
of San Francisco? It would virtually create. a
monopoly of the burial business. The ordinance
is void because it attempts to make a nuisance
by special enactment of a business which is -hot
a nuisance per se, but an absolute public ne
cessity. It is the duty of the court to declare
such an ordinance invalid. The relatives J of
the dead who- own plats in the- various ceme
teries will be- deprived of certain' rights arls~
Ing -under .-contracts: held by them,' if this
ordinance is I upheld. - ! For . the Â¦ reasons glvon
the Judgment of the â¢ lower court Â¦ was in error,
and this appellant should be discharged.
Haven cited-. a Portland case similar to
the one under discussion, in which it was
held that such a- law -was unreasonable
and therefore . Invalid. - Arbitrary | and op
pressive laws were held by all courts to
be unconstitutional, and Haven contended
that the burial -ordinance was both ar
bitrary and oppressive; The right to reg
ulate burials was conceded by Haven, but
there was a. vast difference between regu
lation and prohibition, and . it. was just
here that- the Supervisors crossed, the con
stitutional limits. Resuming he said: *A
"I -concede nothing," replied Haven.
"All I say is that it has been done in oth
er States. .; This ordinance is unjust, un
reasonable and '. unfair, and therefore'in
valid. â, There ; are 30,000 acres of j unoccu
pied land in .this city and county remote
from public. occupation, and the use ot
these vast tracts for burial purposes Is in
no sense a nuisance, nor. can it be of dam
age to any. citizen. An ordinance which
prohibits burials within j such a vast ter
ritory, is: unreasonable,- . and â¢ necessarily
void under the provisions of the constitu
tion." â¢: Â¦ --Â¦- -:Â¦â¢â¢ -- Â¦- - . â¢ Â¦ â¢ - . â¢
"Do , you '. concede that, the Legislature,
may j pass a - law - empowering the - Super
visors of San â¢> Francisco to ; prohibit
burials?',' asked McEnerney. -"â¢- i : .. . i T,
Haven resumed with the statement that
cemeteries are not nuisances except by
reason of special facts, none of which ap
pear in the case at Issue.' He; cited* from
authorities in support "of his contention
that the popular prejudice against- ceme
teries was largely based on superstition.
Then, referring to the question of munici
pal control, Haven said that there was no
authority conferred, either by -tho- constU
tution or the charter, upon the Board of
Supervisors to prohibit burials 'in San
Francisco. The constitution confers mere- ;
ly police power in the matter.? of - regu-r
lating the public health^. while the charter
only empowers the Supervisors . to abato
nuisances .and to exercise Its,." ordinary,
functions in the. matter of health regula
tions. â¢â¢ In others States the L'eglsiat'ures

The opening argument was made in be
half of the appellant by Attorney Haven.
He- read a brief upon the subject filed
with the appeal and then proceeded to
discuss the general facts of the case.. He
maintained that cemeteries are necessary
and useful in communities, , and In no
sense nuisances in themselves.
"We concede that point," remarked Mc-
Enerney. . . . Â» .:,-'-.
The appellant was represented by Attor
neys J. F. Cowdery, Robert Harr.son, Ws
S. Wood and Thomas E. Haven. The
city's interests were in the hands of Dis-r
trict Attorney Byington and Attorney'
Garret McEnerney as special counsel.
The validity of the ordinance prohibit

To begin with, he -rode, with both too

two miles his saddle, which had slipped,
was almost on the neck -of Lizella, and
then.'tb "cap the climax,' the saddle nearly
went to pieces. According -to; O'Connor's

O'Connor's Bad Judgment.
Winnie O'Connor piloted . the -. aged
daughter of Morello, , which- closed at.i3
to 10, and sulking Bangor had -friends
willing -to", risk coin. on his -chance at 4
and 5.- They were influenced, possibly by.
the fact that the redoubtable Xash Tur
ner had the leg up. It >va"s O'Connor's
fatewell . appearance .this season, and. .far
from covering himself with glory, he
made a sad mess of it, -clearly illustrating
that riding long distance races was not
his forte.
Long before the horses were called for
the main event of the day the grand stand
was crowded with beauty and fashion,
trie clubhoVise verandas and lawn were
dotted with groups of society folks, and
even the paddock lawn had its representa
tion of the fair sex. Grizzled veterans of
the old days. of Thad Stevens and True
Blue met again to recall reminiscences of
those dead heroes of the turf. Taken all
in ail, It was one oi the brilliant days of
the season. Only three contested for. the

Quex's defeat cut the attendance down.
Jeffries was represented by ' Billy De

Hn drew $S0,4S7. The fighters' share of this
was $1S,SOO.
John Bradbury and other sportsmen are
said to have contributed to the $25,000

Contrary to expectations, only . two
places were represented yesterday. in the
bidding, this city and Los Angeles. The
latter was represented by James Morley
and John Brink.. They made three propo
sitions: A $25,000 purse, already on. deposit
In the Citizens' Bajik, Lor Angeles, of
75 per cent of the gross receipts, or 70 per
cent* with a guarantee the purse will be
$20,000. The 'Los Angeles men had, a $5000
certified check to post as a forfeit -to guar
antee their ability to promote the right
successfully. They also showed a license
entitling them to hold a "prize. Â«li,--.t ;> In
Los Angeles during May.. The fight would
be held out-of-doors In the daytime and
ths club would retain- a one-third share
of the picture. privilege. ...
The bids are in for the proposed Jeff

ald. secretary, have issued a reply to the
resolutions adopted on Friday night by
the San Francisco Labor Council in refer
ence to the troubles existing between Car
penter's Union No. 483 and the Building'
Trades Council. These resolutions claimed
that the Building Trades Council was en
deavoring to control the whole situation.
In reply the officers of the District
Council of Carpenters say that those who
signed the resolutions of the San Fran
cisco. Labor Council are not actuated by
the best of motives and are attempting
to disrupt the entire labor movement.

Disapprobation of an actor named Chu
JFu, expressed by a part of the audience
In a strenuous manner, caused a panic at
the Chinese theater last* night. For a
Sew minutes Chinamen fairly boiled out
of the exit and down the stairs In the
full belief that the highbinder war had
"broken out again.
Sergeant Conboy stemmed the torrent
(of frightened Celestials sufficiently to
pain entrance to the theater, and ascer
tained the cause of the panic.
It developed that certain Chinamen
who have been cut off from the free list
a cf the theater went in a body last night
* purposely to create a disturbance. They
carried concealed In their blouses a plen
tiful Eupply of firecrackers and eggs,
and when Chu Fu came out looking like
"Ferris Hartman in the "Serenade" they
forthwith put in transit toward the stage
B. deluse of over,-r!pe lien product and '

election however, is a very different ,. thing
from an* election called for the purpose of vot

Detective Ryan, who was detailed on
the case, obtained a clew that both Ste
vens and Sanchez were in Chicago, and
'the authorities there were instructed' to
be on the lookout for them. Sanchez was
arrested but Stevens is still at liberty.
The only thing found on Sanchez was an
imitation diamond taken from a necklace
which Mrs. Darling used to wear on the
stage and which she has positively iden
tified. Sanchez evidently thought the
stone was genuine.
Stevens had been afforded accommoda
tion in the basement of Mrs. Darlingjs
residence, and by that means obtained
knowledge of where she kept her jew
elry. During her temporary absence on
January 24 he entered the house, accom
panied it is said by Sanchez, and stole
Mrs. Darling's diamonds and other Jew
elry. Stevens and Sanchez fled eastward,
and as Mrs. Darling did not discover her
loss till the following day they got a good
start.
Raymond Sanchez was brought back
from Chicago yesterday morning by De
tective Ryan and booked at the City Pris
on on a charge of burglary. He is ac
cused of being the accomplice of John
Stevens, the physical instructor, who is
wanted for stealing $9000 worth of jewelr$
from Mrs. Elizabeth V. Darling, 913 Eddy

Owing to the mildness of the weather
yesterday play on the tennis courts
around the bay was lively. The principal
event was the doubles try-out of tbe Uni

court. As was expected Reuben Hunt
and George Baker won, but the fact that
they won in straight sets was somewhat
of a surprise. MacGavln played an ex
cellent game, but his partner, Brown,
who Is much stronger in singles than in
doubles, did not play well. The score in
favor of Hunt and Baker was 6-4, 6-3, 6-1.

marry her... She also said::.' 'If he does not
marry- me I: will shoot -him, and I..wili

NEW YORK, March : 15?â Florence
Burns. was arraigned In the' Court of Spe
cial Sessions before Justice Mayer, to-day
in the continuation of ' the case against
her on the charge of shooting Walter S.
Brooks/at the Glen â¢ Island Hotel several
weeks ago., .' Mrs. Thomas â¢_ W. Brooks,
mother of the dead man, testified:
The theft for. which Smith was arrested
was committed on Friday night while
Mrs. Kruttschnltt was absent for a short
time from her apartments. When she re
turned she found the doors, locked as 'she
had left them and nothing apparently
molested. It- was only when she had oc
casion to look in her bureau drawers that
she discovered that her two handsome
gold watches, with their; fine gold chains,
a diamond brooch and two diamond pins
were missing. It was at once apparent
that the thief was or had been in the em
ploy of the hotel, as It was evident that
he used a pass key In entering the rooms.
Until last Thursday Smith was em
ployed as bellboy In the hotel, but 'on* that
aay he was discharged for- some' breach
of conduct. On the following night the
theft of Mrs. Kruttschnitt's: jewels, oc-f
curred. Suspicion immediately pointed to
the discharged bellboy,, as . it was sup- 1 ,
posed that he had an intimate knowledge
of the apartment occupied by the K/utt
schnitts and that he had frequently . seen
the valuable jewels. As. soon. as 1 the rob-*
bery was reported to Captain Seymour
defectives were ..detailed to ' search . for
Smith. His name , was placed on v the
detinue ; book, and no one, not even "his
mother, was permitted to see him.
Harry Smith, who resides at; 426 Butter
street and who was formerly ; a bellboy
hi the Hotel< Richelieu at Van j Ness ave
nue and Geary street, was arrested last
night on suspicion that he had a hand in
stealing Mrs. Julius KruttBChnitt's Jewels
trcm her rooms in itie hotel mentioned.
The arrest was made ' by Detective
Thomas Gibson at the corner : of Mason
and Turk streets. The youth was taken
to the Southern station and his . name
placed on the detinue book. '..;â¢ '..-.Â¦_ Â¦" _.'Â¦;
Mrs. Bentley was found guilty a week
ago by Judge Edgar of Berkeley of vio
lating a town ordinance that requires
people to connect their houses with the
street sewer. She claimed that the health
authorities were persecuting her. and said
that rather than pay a $30 tine she would
serve out the dollars at the rate of one
for each day in jail.
As soon as the jail doors were opened
to her the aged woman made baste to get
away from their, vicinity. She went
straight to her home in Berkeley.
The' attorney filed an appeal and then
had Judge Ellsworth accept $100 in cash
to insure her reappearance in case the
appeal goes against her.
Six days behind heavy steel bars, w.tn
forty-four more staring her in the lace,
have made .Mrs. Honorah Bentley, the
aged and rich Berkeley woman, tired of
jail life. She got her attorney to get her
out of the county bastile to-day pending
an appeal that she has taken from the
decision x>f Justice of the Peace Edgar
against her.

ored flowers, the one in the east being
particularly attractive.. The work of the
evening was carefully watched by the
visiting official, and then there was the
exemplification of the initiatory degree
by the initiation of two strangers, a lady,
and a gentleman. The officers had evi
dently made a special effort to show their
ability in this, for at- no time in the his
tory of the chapter was the degree ever
conferred in so commendable a manner.
That 'was 'the unanimous verdict : of .the
grand matron and those who spoke under
the good of the order. Every officer was
perfect In the work, and when that' :is
stated there remains nothing more, to be
said. The assemblage was addressed by
Mrs. Giberson, Mrs. Willats and Messrs..

while en route to Honolulu a~ few" months

The grand chancellor! is arranging to
officially visit the lodges at Jackson,
Amador, Sonora, ; Angels Camp, Carters,
Coulterviile, Mariposa and Chinese Camp
during the month of April. - This itinerary
will probably be. his final one, as his term

At next -fall's convention of the Su-

able the present , law providing for an
official order for the password will be
abolished and that an official receipt upon
a card to be carried in a small folding
case, such as the Elks have found* so
advantageous,- will be substituted for 1 it.
The present system of requiring, a travel-
ing member to produce both an official
receipt and â¢ an order for the password
before he is entitled to the password from
any but his own ; chancellor commander
is generally regardect as unsatisfactory
and obsolete. The holding of. annual elec-
tions instead of semi-annual, as now, will
also come up and will be strongly advo-
cated. ' Â¦
Bald Mountain Lodge of Forest, Sierra

. Live Oak Lodge of Oakland continues
to pursue the even tenor of its way,
steadily increasing its membership with
material of the most desirable character.
Grand Chancellor Calkins . has promul-
gated a decision to the effect that
Pythian law gives members of the uni-
form â¢ rank the right to wear their uni-
forms in subordinate lodge conventions
and that a chancellor commander has no
legal right- to order the members of the
military branch to remove their caps t'ur-
ing the progress of such a convention.
This point has been frequently raised in

ly decided in California.

University in April. 19C0.
SOVEREIGN PEOPLE ARE NOT SOV-
EREIGN.
THE SUPREME POWER IN A NATION. :
The fact that in the political organization of
every nation there Is a person or a body of per-
Bons holding power that Is theoretically unlim-
ited indicates that in one particular, at least,
all states are alike. They are alike In that in
some part of each there is vested an authority
which is not legally curtailed by any other au-
thority. They differ in that this authority In
Borne cases is vested in one man: In other in-
stances in a limited assembly of men; andin Mill
other instances In a union of several assem-
blies, or in a body of the mature male citizens.
But. However held, the authority in all cases Is
THE AUTHORITY OF THE CZAR. SUP-
POSING HIM TO BE AN ABSOLUTE
PRINCE. IS NOT GREATER THAN THAT
HELD BY THE MAKERS OF THE SL-
PREME LAW IN ENGLAND. FRANCE. THE
UNITED STATES. OR IN ANY OTHER IN-
DEPENDENT STATE.
One state rr.ay have a larger army or a more
powerful navy than another, but its independ-
ence is not theoretically more complete, nor its
nominal authority moie unlimited. Thus the
power of THE MAKERS OF THE SUPREME
LAW IN THE UNITED STATES IS NOT
LESS ABSOLUTE THAN THAT OF. THE
CZAR OF RUSSIA.
The difference between these two great 6tates.
observed from this point of view, consists In
the fact that, in the one case, the supreme
power is vested in one nan; In the other case it
is vested in a complicated union of political
bodies.
This supreme, unlimited power is called sov-
ereignty, and the person or body of persons
holding or exercising it is called sovereign.
WHAT THE SOVEREIGN IN RUSSIA MAY
DO THAT THE SOVEREIGN IN THE
UNITED STATES MAY DO.
It 1b thought that the wishes of 'the bulk of
the nation' are more likely to be respected in
the United States than in Russia: and this
thought rests on the knowledge that in Ruse!*.
the supreme power is in the hands of one man,
while in the United States it is vested in a
union of assemblies that involves, either di-
rectly or indirectly, a large part of the popula-
tion of the country; and it is expected that the
large number of persons thus involved will be
disposed to use their powerful influence to di-
rect the actions of the state in the line of their
collective interests.
THE ELECTORS AND THE SOVEREIGN.
While it is recognized that the sovereign here
described is the supreme legal authority in the
state, it is also recognized that back of 'the
sovereign in a constitutional state there is a
body of. voters called by Professor Dicey the
'â¢Political Sovereign." on whom the severaly
members of the legal sovereign ultimately de-
pend. This body is composed of the electors
whose vt'tec determine who ehall belong to the
supreme lawmaklng body.
The electors set up the legal sovereign, but
they have no power to make a law or Issue a
decree. THEY MAY EXPRESS THEIR WILL
WITH RESPECT TO PERSONS. BUT THEIR
WILL AS TO THE FORM AND CONTENT
OF LAWS HAS NO LEGAL EXPRESSION.
EXCEPT THROUGH THE ORGANIZED
BODY WHICH THEY CREATE.
In the British empire the courts will take no
notice of the will of the electors. The Judges
know nothing about any will of the people, ex-
cept as far as that will is expressed by an act
of Parliament, and would never suffer the va-
lidity of a statute to be questioned on the
ground of its having been passed or being kept
alive in opposition to the wishes of the elec-
tors." (Dicey. The Law of the Constitution.
1SS3, 76.)
"And no rule, wtfether of morality or of law,
which contravenes an act of Parliament, binds
any court throughout the realm." (Dicey,
;&3.)
THIS IS THE ATTITUDE OF THE COURTS
IN EVERY CIVILIZED NATION. IT IS CER-
TAINLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND
THE POWERS OF THE ELECTORS AS A
POLITICAL BODY. BUT THEIR QUALITIES
ARE SO ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM
THOSE OF THE LEGAL SOVEREIGN THAT
IT IS LIKELY TO ADD CONFUSION TO OUR
STATEMENTS TO CALL THEM ANY KIND
OF A SOVEREIGN.
THE -REPUBLICAN MUTUAL ALLIANCE
la organized for the purpose of encouraging all
voters to exercise their right of suffrage, in
co-operation with each other, that their col-
lective interests may be centralized In one su-
preme body, thus forming an organized pow-
erful influence that will act directly with the
making and operating of our State and local
ffovernnsent.
The following preamble, constitution and by-
laws have been adopted by the "Republican
Mutual Alliance" for iu organization and gov-
ernment :
. PREAMBLE.
Whereas. We the members of the Republican
"Mutual Alliance," knowing that^jhe prfn-zlple
if universal suffrage is the fundamental i-rin-
ciple which serves as the basis cf a syntem
essential to our form of government, be it
national. State or local, and
Whereas. The genius of the people exercis-
ing such right enables them to contract with
themselves to make a government, and
Whereas, At frequent intervals the power
granted to such government Is returned to the
people for their consideration, that the -;ame
may be continued or changed; and In the exer-
cise of such rights for the continuance or
change of government, issues are sometimes
created by which the people, for the put pose
of regulating themselves, invoke the aid of
that parliamentary law peculiar to a free pÂ«o-
rle. by which they are divided into a maiorlty
ajid. a. minority and jsuch division is often-
times the origin of new political bodies from
Â¦which pojltlcal issues arise and again divide
the people within themselves: and
Whereas, the "Republican Mutual Alliance."
being organized for the purpose of uniting all
I*rsons having the right to vote, and for the
purpose of. voting as a unit to aid in making
a government for the protection, security and
benefit of all the people, and especially for the
mutual interests and welfare of its members
and believing that there is only one legitimate
way to make a government or elect to a public
cf flee. . and that is by obtaining for euch gov-
ernment or Individual the highest number of
votes; that therefore, we, the members of the
"Republican Mutual Alliance." in order to
form a perfect organization of voters and es-
tablish discipline, harmony, sociability and the
general welfare and prosperity of our members
do adopt the following:

This constitution ehall not be amended re-

The foregoing By-Laws, or. any- Section
thereof, shall not be amended, altered, re-

tee. Provided, however, that no action shall

The "Republican Mutual Â¦ Alliance" recog-
nizes the fact. that every Citizen has an Equit-
able Right at the Ballot-box, and that the
proper exercise of such right is the rock upon
which the foundation of our National, State
and Local Government Â¦ stands. \
The men who make the government' should
take all pains to prevent : any special class of
citizens from getting- so much power that they
might be dangerous. For that reason -all po-
litical power should return every few years to
the people, so that the people may have the
power of choice. . . . '
The "Republican Mutual Alliance" asks in-
discriminately the co-operation of all Citizens
and Voters of the State of California (especially
or the City and County of San Francisco), Irre-
spective of their past social, political or busi-
ness success or grievances, , to partlcpiate with
us in organizing the Voters of the City and
County of San Francisco and State of Califor-
nia In one political organization for the purpose
of voting as a unit to aid in making a Govern-
ment for the Protection, Security and Benefit
of all the people, and not for any special class
or corporation.
Any Citizen may become a member by apply-
ing at. the Headquarters. 1104 Market street,
rooms 2i and 22. Branch organizations can be
organized upon the application of five citizens
residing within any election precinct within the
btate. __ Â¦ Â¦ ;

: While It may be true that ''imitation" Is'
the.sincerest form of flattery," it does not
follow that the originator and owner, of a
valuable copyrighted article will quietly
submitt6 the knave who steals the hon-
est man's money by. deliberate forgery. "A
well-known Boston business man,, who
has, by" patient Industry, keen' Insight and
honestjjeffort, " built.- up a large .and, 'con-,
stantly increasing business, discovered a
few months ago that some one, who
ought to be repenting In prison,
had' made' and was selling In San
Franciscp an , inferior '.article, which
bore ! but a ! faint V* resemblance " 'to
the. original, and by ; ttie.use of the photo-'
electrotype process had forged >' the " box
label," the circular and. trade mark of Ben
Levy's Lablache' Face ; Powder, which is"
known' all, over' v the. world, and is In gen-
eral -use iby the r best .-and . most;r distin-J
guished women, not only In America,: but
also | in London, Paris, , Dresden,. Hong-:
kong, Shanghai, Mexico and' Manila;- and
In fact everywhere. Its virtues have been;
sounded; by Sarah. Bernhardt, : Mme.' ; Em-'
ma ] Eames, \ Maude I Adams, Mlle.' ; Rhea,
MMe. Â¦ de I Lussan, ' Miss Marguerita Â¦ Sylva ,
Miss v Lettice Fairfax, i and .by score3 v of
otHer famous women of the stage and in
private life;", v .^..;."-- 'Â¦ . Â¦ '. Â¦,"-.-"Â¦ 'Â¦''
-Of course it goes without 1 the saying
that if Lablache Face Powder were but a
mere combination of common chalk. and
perfume ' no i one : would -' have . forged Ben
.Levy's . name and , attempted to . steal his
business. Jt is only valuable sigmatures
and . articles of fame â¢'* that . .Â¦ are â¢â¢Â¦ forged.
When Mr. Levy's -attention- was called to
this matter he immediately, consulted his
attorneys, 1 Messrs. vBrandeis, Dunbar &
Nutter of Boston 'and Messrs. Rothchlld
&Ach^of San Francisco, 'â¢ who 'brought^a
bill, of complaint in the United States Cir-
cuit Court of, Northern California against
J^M. Wright & Co.- of San Francisco, >Â¦ th^s
seller, of this spurious powder,, and 'ob-
tained 1 an injunction prohibiting .further
sales. <Â¦ Suit is also brought \ to ; " recover
damages.. '. Â¦ ,' Â¦Â¦' â¢'Â¦ ' â¢ " â ' ',Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ .,
The forger did his .work, so cleverly that
careful scrutiny is necessary to detect the
difference i between - the Â¦ genuine . and "the
spurious."- The b6x-'label of the genuine'ls
clear and bright: while the printing of the
"counterfeit label is 4 dark and muddy. Mr.
Levy. feels, that his reputation is at stake,
andhe is sparing no trouble or expense to
rlghtUhis wrong:. The, Lablache Powder
is, a positive ; benefit to the complexion '
and-istheimost delightful preparation- of
the kind known, while the spurious. article
Is - deleterious . and': liable Â» to cause Injury
Mr. Levy asks that every, lady, using the
.Lablache .will examine the label carefully-
and if in doubt: as to* the genuineness 7 of
the article to send to: Ben Levy &â¢ Co 125

est Words Prom Mrs. Pinkham to
Mothers.
Every mother possesses information of. vital value to her young
daughter. That daughter is a precious legacy, and tne responsibility. ,
for her future is largely in the- hands of the mother. The mysterious
change that develops the thoughtless girl into the. thoughtful
should find the mother on" the watch. day' and night As she cares iov,
the physical well-being of her daughter, so \nll the woman be, and her
children also. ; â¢ â¢ .
"When the young girl's thoughts become sluggish, when she expe-
riences headaches, dizziness; faintness, and exhibits an abnormal dispo-
sition to sleep, pains in tho back and lower limbs, eyes dirn^ desire for
solitude, and a dislike for the society of other girls, when she is a
mystery to herself and friends, then the mother should go to her aid
promptly. At such a time the greatest aid to nature is Lydia E. Pink- .
ham's Vegetable Compound. It prepares the young system for the
coming change, and is the surest reliance in this hour of trial. .
The following letters from Mrs. Southard are practical proof of
Mrs. Pinkham's efficient advice to young women. . Â¦ . ., ] :

The contention was made that the pat
ent by which the land was acquired was
fraudulent and defective, in that the land
was mining and not agricultural land at
the time the patent was issued. The
famous Green Copper mine Js located on
the property, and although it was worked
for ore since the early '60's the mine was
shut down for many years. By. a resur
vey of the property about the time the
patent was issued a strip of land seventy
three feet fwide and claimed by. Raynor
became the property of Sydney.
The main point at issue was the lateral
rights set up by the defendant in his an
swer. It was contended that the rights
to property of lndlvduals exteinded even
to the center of the earth. That is to say,
no adjoining property owner working a
mine on his own land could cross the
lines of ins claim beneath the surface
and delve into the property of his neigh
bor. The court held this contention to be
coiind law, he basing his judgment upon
thp opinion o/ the late Circuit Judge Saw
yer that under the common law the ex
tent of a man's ownership was not con
nned to the area on the surface, but to
the center of the earth itself. It follows
by this ruling, therefore, that miners are
not privileged to mine below the surface
it the vein being mined by them extends
into land which is owned by another.
Another interesting question decided by
Jfdge Cochran was the one of patents,
the validity of which is attacked collat
erally, as waa the cate in the suit men
tioned. It was held that the validity of
land patents couia only be tested by di
rect proceedings brought In behalf of the
United States, for the reason that the
Federal Government is most directly in
terested in seeing that the patents issued
by its sanction are supported ag-ainst all
comers. During the trial the questions of
lost and obliterated corners of land were
raited nnd discussed. While the court
held for Ihc defendant as to his right to
the seventy-three feet of land claimed by
him, the plaintiff Is estopped from work
ing his mine beyond the lateral lines of !
the land defined by the patent. Campbell
& Spillman and Bourdette & Hoyt of San
Francisco appeared for the plaintiff and
James S. Peck of Merced and C. G.
Goucher of Mariposa handled the case for
the defenCant.
A. suit of considerable interest to min
ing- men and those owning mining land in
California was decided by Judge John M.
Cochran at Mariposa last Thursday. The
suit was that of H. O. Raynor aginsV O.
R. Sydney for a decree ejecting the de
fendant from a portion of section 3V in
Mariposa County, which had been secured
by the plaintiff by virtue of an agricul
tural patent in 1S73.
The show was again greeted by a
crowded house last night. Two perforin
ences, one in the afternoon and one in
the evening, will be given each day while
the company Is in the city. It is expected
the Pavilion will be crowded during the
performances this afternoon and evening.
Even sea lions have been taught to per
form. They waddle about with consid
erable difficulty, but they appear to take
<!clight in exhibiting their accomplish
ments.
But the ponies, wonderful as they are,
constitute only a part of the attractions
cf the enow. They share their popularity
Â¦with the trained elephants, the trained
camels, which are the only "ships of the
desert" that have ever been taught to
1 erform, and the monkeys, which con
tribute their share of amusement.
In their display tiie little Shetland
ponies, which are probably the finest of
their species in this country, if not in
the world, show a remarkable degree of
Intelligence. These glossy coated littie
animals have been taught to march and
countermarch and even to waltz to music.
Then there is the talking pony, which an
swers correctly and without any prompt
ing all manner of difficult Questions. He
Elves his answers by pawing with his
itet or shaking his head- He can tell the
exact number of years of life he has
fceen, the number of days in the week
Â»nd the number of. meals he receives in
a. car.
School chiMren, with their faces aglow
v.-ith pleasure, flocked by the hundreds to
Mechanics' Pavilion yesterday afternoon
to be amused and delighted by the open
ing performance of Norris & Rowe's
trained animals. From the military
maneuvers executed by the Bhetlands
and the tricks performed by the dogs
down to the ever-ludicrous antics of the
turnkeys, all is interesting' and instruc
tive and affords an excellent idea to the
height to which .animal intelligence can
be cultivated. â¢
Animals in Norris &
Rowe's Show Are

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, March 15.â There was very
llttlÂ« activity Ehon-n In trade In stocks to-day
citing to the complicated situation of the mar
ket. During the morning; there was a latent
dread that the back 'statement would reveal
the narrow margin of. the surplus entirely wiped
out. There was no urgent pressure to sell,
but prices sagged, except for a few special
clocks. After the publication of the state
ment there was a recovery In prices, but the
demand was listless and unimportant and the
market closed dull and only barely .steady at
some concessions from the. rally. .There has
been so evidence in the stock market of liqui
dation to anything- like the extent- of ;tne loan
contraction repotted In the statement. This
Is undoubtedly due to tha fact that the loan
obligations hare been shifted rather than paid.
It Is known that part cf them have been shift
ed to foreigners through the exchange market
and it is believed that the trust companies
have beeen large lenders, drawing on their
deposits with the banks for the purpose. *The
email disturbance caused In thÂ« money znarket
by this extensive shifting of loans encourages
the hepe that future requirements will" be met
with eltntlar ease. It la expected also that the
Government bond redemption yesterday and
to-flay will &!I be reflected In next week's bank
statement, minus the deposits for transfer to
h Â« e JÂ°' Ume S f t* 8 "^ in bonds has some
what -decreased, but prices have been well
maintained for the most part. .

The Chicago letter of Bolton, de Ruyter &

Receipts of hogs 55,000, against 30,000 last
year. The market is quiet and haa the sup
port , of confident buying by x prominent people
and local packing interests. Cash demand is
slow, however, and receipts of hogs keep large
and we think in time must have their effect
upon prices. Shipments of meats were 1.4.V1,
000 pounds, against '1,914,000 pounds last year.
Lard 654,000 pounds, against 274,000 pound*.
Pork 409 barrels, against 937 barrels."

NEW YORK. March 15.â The Financier
says: The statement of the New York Asso
ciated Banks this . week . showed a loss of
$8,169,700 cash, of which '$5,338,600 consisted
of eoecle and $831,100 legal tinders. This
amount Is about equal to that which was esti
mated Â¦ from the traceable movement of money
during the week resultinff from the Treasury
operations, | transfers .to- San Francisco, export
of gold March 8and other Items, of loÂ«s less
thÂ« averase of the extraordinary bond ' payi
ments on Friday^and the gain to- the banks
from new gold. The statement was made uoon
rising averages for cash. <he- payments for un
matured bonds on Friday and Saturday havine
amounted to $4,049,374. The loans were^ re
duced by $14,372,000. This was partly due to
calls in aomeof the banks whose reserves
were low and also to the quite general absence
of offerings of loans , on the Stock Exchange
by the downtown institutions. Though the
trust comDanles met the greater part of the
demand for loansjjflurlns the week,' .their opera
tions were not reflected in the statement -The
payment on Saturday by â¢ the National* Citv
Bank of about,- $21; 500, 000 for dividend* 01
Standard Oil and Consolidated will this -week
release funds which, were accumulated for the
purpose of dividends and< tend- to relieve in
some degree . the tension In monetary condi
tions. . : The . deposits decreased - $21 296 700
which amount Is but $750,000 more than' the
total 'Of the loss of loans ' and of cash. Here
tofore the statement was harmonious. â¢ The re
duction of; $5,324,175 in:. reserve requirement*
in great part offset the loss of cash; bo, that
â¢the curolus . reserve decreased â¢ only SS45 - tn
$3,112,900. against $10,002,600 at ; the T' corre
sponding, date a year '&kq;;: The fact 1 that the
above noted reductions in'surplus was smaller
than was expected, and also that the cash was
made' upon rising â¢ averages, as above noted,
tends to relieve apprehension ' of ' money ten
sion during this week. . ;
"For the more Important articles In the list
there is noted to-d*y & fairly steady buying
Interest, end some addition to the firmness -al
ready reported on both prunes and apricots is
observed. Â¦ In the former Â«ize* 40s to 50s and
60s to 60s claim the most attention and show
a 'finade' stronger tone, with 6%c to 7c quoted
on Santa CUra fruit In 25-lb boxes for the
first and 6'4c to e\t,c on the latter. Outside
Xrult *n both Â«lzes 1* etill reported available
at 6%c for 40s and 6c for 5Os, and old fruit
at a shade tinder, according to teller and qual
ity. The larger size is reported in compara
tively light stock and a further advance on
Iteet offerings is not Improbable. The remain
ing sizes fhow a moderate interest down to
the very email fruit. In the latter there is
reported more interest, with business pending
in a large way, the basis of negotiations being
withheld. In Jobbing quantities the market for
120s and up ie quoted at 3c In bags. Coast
edvices continue to note a more active situa
tion on both new and old fruit for export and
Interior account. On new Santa Clara the
cuast view is on the 3Â»Ac four-size oasis for 40s
to 60s, 60s to 70s and 70s to 80s, and 3^c
four-eize basis on r>Os to 60s, 80s to 90s and
fids to 100s. A report that a further concen
tration of stocks of new fruit has taken place
has not received confirmation here so~far as
U known. In apricots the market continues
active and iirm. Peaches are in fair request
and steady. Pears are scarce and â¢ the j viewb
of holders strong. In raisins the spot market
for eeeded Is steady. We hear of no impor
tant movement, but a fair Jobbing trade is
reported. Sales, according to holder, are re
ported at from SVic to S%c for choice and 8%c
to 8%c for fancy In 16-ounce cartons. Some
holders of fancy coaÂ£t eeeded quote up to 9c,
but we hear of no Important business at that
figure. Loose raisins are practically un
changed. Valencia layers are held at from
7 He to 7%c and a. fair business Is noted. In
currants the market continues fairly steady,
but we bear cf no Important movement. Un
deaned Amallas are quoted as to holder at
from 6ttc to 5%e In barrels. Figs are In fair
Â¦hape, but we hear of no Important business.
In nuts epot Naples Â¦walnuts are very firm
and reported In light stock. Shelled almonds
arÂ« firm and a moderate Interest Is reported
through the list."

But undoubtedly the principal ground for the

fact that the largest borrower? are the great
Â«!,Â£?? a v d ,^. bank ! n? 'nteregts whose, great
syndicate holdings in securities give them a
vital Interest in maintaining the tranquillity
of the money market conditions. A feature of
the week has been the interruption of the out
go of gold by export This was due to bor
rowing money In foreign markets through Uie

either extension of loans coming due to forelen
borrowers or new borrowings abroad as the

, The character of the market Is much the
same this week as for some time past. The
great mass of securities comprised in the great
railway systems of the country have laid inert
In contrast with their conspicuous leadership
of the market in times of genuine speculative
activity. The Important Industrials have not
Been so notably neglected. These securities
are more Influenced by causes individual to
them and to the trades with which' they are
concerned and less by general conditions of a
financial or Industrial character than are the
flocks of representative railroads. Â« They are
likely, therefore, to be resorted to for a spec
ulative medium In times of dullness and
apathy by the. speculative public. But the
feature of the week's market, as for some
time past, has been the spasmodic movements
ai L. 'PUTts of activity in many obscure stocks
which are seldom traded in on the Stock Ex
change. Most of these movements have only
vague or conflicting explanations and the sud
den ., activity is likely to be followed by as
sudden a neglect and with sudden and wide
relapses in priees. These phenomena are the
clear evidences of the artificial and manipula
tive character of the movements. Speculative
pools are formed and an accumulation made
of the stock picked for the movement. This
buying in itself raises the price. A rising price
is the sure attraction for others to buy. accord-
Ing to the law of human tendencies. The accu
mulation by the pool has reduced the. floating
â¢upply of the stock market and thus facilitated
the bidding of prices against the newly de
veloped outside demand. : The pool is then
thrown upon its best resources of skill and
manipulation to feed this new demand with
sufficient moderation and keep the price sus
tained at a point to yield it a profit: After
that the stock may fall back into a new period
of oblivion.. This his been the history of many
of the recent movements in the stock market.
The seasonable dullness in the general specu
lation is due to obvious causes and the general
acquiescence In it is Illustrated by the large
number of absentees from Wall street among
the figures that are influential in affairs there.
This Is *o marked as to make it difficult to se
cure quorums for directors' meetings, more
than one of which ha a therefore been passed.

barrels flour yesterday."
The weekly letter of Bolton,' de.Ruyter &

steady. The relative firmness of the cables was
a disappointment to local bears and prospect of
a change: to much ' colder weather throughout
the winter wheat belt also checked to some ex
.tent the selling. Conditions of supply and de
mand are not at the moment very bearish. De
cline here has brought us upon an export basis
and foreigners have been fair buyers of wheat

advices from Â¦ Pacific Coast are, : surplus wheat
in that ' quarter* has been pretty largely ex
hausted by the export demand of the last two

be more largely supplied from the Atlantic

of relatively 7 1 unimportant territory in the

seem favorable â¢ and the acreage is very large.;
This creates a' very bearish feeling among a

"a fair decrease on ; Monday. . Northwest
minis report a much better demand for flour."

Dr. G. S. Moore. 332 O'Farrell St.. San
Franciscoâ Dear Doctor: Please send three
bottles of your hair restorer. I have used
two -bottles and I find It the best remedy I
have ever used, and I think I have tried al-
most everything I have heard of and never
found anything that would stop It from fall-
ing. Your remedy stopped It from, falling
and I am astonished -. to see how thick the
new hair Is all over my head with the two
bottles. I do not think I will need more than
; the present order, but I shall try and keep
some on hand to clean my scalp -with. My
head never felt to well as now. Yours truly,
GEORGE BUNNER.
Try Dr. Moore's Walnut Stain for gray
and faded hair. Send for circular. Prepara-
tions sent to all parts of the world.
A RUPTURE truss with steel spring* has been
In use for 100 years without change-. Has
10 per cent been cured with such trusses?
No. Is It not time for a change? Hunter's
Lever Rupture Holder has revolutionized the
antiquated truss, and has made it possible
to cure 90 per cent In 90 days. The holder
la .worn night and day. without torturing.
A continuous pressure Is maintained during
the granulation and growth of the tissue
filling and covering the breach." Would a
wound on the body heal If a hard pad was
bound on It? Never. Has It not the samei
effect on a rupture? Address HUNTER'S

that; it r is the ; principal I thoroughfare of
the city "and ; that r portion of It; seen' first*
by strangers. . It f. is maintained that " the

have been; laid.* .". _ _ - . ; t - .

The lower court decided in favor of the
Terminal Land Company, _ but 'the Su
preme Court reversed that decision. It
ie held that a. ferry, will be of great con
venience to the l public and that the \ per
sonal covenant embodied: in .the original
sate cannet legally prohibit the proposed
improvement. , :
One of .the conditions, under, which the
land was first sold was that-',' nothing
should be done : to it which would Injure
the intercsts-of the realty company.' When
the Southern Pacific Company , began to
build the ferry it-became evident that the
business of the Terminal Railway Com
pany would be injured and litigation com
menced." ' - ; ;s. â¢, . .: ... '
The: realty^ company bought the island
In 1892. The lot^where the ferry landing
is to be built was sold to the Catalina
Yacht Club four years later. The yacht
club decided riot to. use the property and
sold it to~the Southern Pacific
; The Southern Pacinc Railroad Company
has won its fight for a ferry landing on
Terminal Island in San Pedro Bay. by a

The Corning Observer says:
There were 455 wells completed, the new
production Jbeing 1775 barrels. On the last
day of the month : there were 005 rigs and
drilling wells, being fifty-four fewer rigs than
In January. In the Northwestern Ohio and
Indiana fields V decline In field operations was
noted in the -former and -a -slight- increase In
the latter. There were 325 wells completed,
the' new production /being :484a barrels, -and
forty-four dry holes. * At the month end there
were OOiJ rigs and drilling wells, a' decrease
of thirty-two I In new operations. â¢
The Oil City Derrick tells- of the falling
oft in operations in the Pennsylvania oil
Meld for â¢ ; several months. The lowest
point in years was reached in February,
there being 127 fewer wells completed in

line predicts that nicety days after the worK
on:" the Â¦ line â¢ from - -BakerBtWld to - Point t Rich
mond Is begun 'will see the finish of the bis
project. The usual method pursued is to start
forces'of men to work every twenty or twenty

Its section of the line the entire line is nnisheri.
Of ' course time ( will be required to Install the

The experiments that! are being tried
by Chansldr & Canfield in . the Midway
district are attracting much attention. If

A difference of opinion has arisen be
tween Superior Judg* Lawlor and Auditor
Harry Baehr over the- payment of de
mands in favor of citizens drawn to serve
as trial Jurors In criminal cases. The
Auditor, holds that the mere appearance 1
ln court Is not enough to warrant the payi]
ment of $2 per diem to a Juror, while
Judge Lawlor holds that under the codo
It does. Â¦
.The question came up at the 'Auditor's
office yesterday when the demands of 130
jurors were presented for payment. Alex
Fraser, who held a demand signed by
Judge Lawlor for J2 for one- day's "ap
pearance" ln court in February, last, and
Henry Goldstone. who held a similar de
mand, caused- all the â¢' trouble. Fraser' a
; wife told the Auditor that her husband
i had not been in town for five months and
Goldstone said he had not "served" on a
Jury, for more than a "year. This puzzled
the Auditor and for a time trouble for
some one seemed Imminent. '.It was
learned," however, that - Fraser's Â» warrant
should have, been drawn ln favor of M.
Scliwabacher and that the latter's failure
to get his warrant' was^due to a mistake
In -checking the names. Goldstone had
not served, but he had "appeared" in'
answer to - a summons and under Judge
Lawlor's ruling he Is entitled to pay.
In the Supervisors* .budget for this year
the sum of J16.00O la set aside to pay jurors
who "serve." There were thirty-seven $2
demands presented to the Auditor yester
day for payment. The holders thereof
had' answered summons to appear and
according to Judge Lawlor they are en
titled to pay, ' :Â¦
. As the warrants were all signed by the
Judge, the*Auditor had no redress and haU
to cash them. :
, Before School Director James Denman
can sit as one of the Judges in the trial
of Miss Mary Â¦. C. - McKinney, the teacher
in the John Swett Grammar School, who Is
charged: with incompetency, he must con
vince Judge Hunt that he Is. not prejudiced
against the lady. . According to Attorney
Stephen . V. : Costello, who . is looking out
for the legal end of Miss McKinney's bat
tle, with the Board of Education and Prin
cipal â¢ Lyser, . who ; preferred Â¦ the charge
against her,' Denman is not in a frame of
mind to give the teacher a fair and im
partial , hearing. ;'; ::'Â¦'Â¦
The "school teacher's" attorney has had
Director fc. " W. ' Mark ; disqualified for ut
tering opinions adverse to ; the lady and
yesterday: Costello asked for a writ ot
prohibition restraining Denman from try
ing Miss McKinney -because of -a certain
spejsch the aged educator hadwith Super
intendent Webster. In this, talk, alleges
Costello,' : Denman said: Â« "The woman Is
