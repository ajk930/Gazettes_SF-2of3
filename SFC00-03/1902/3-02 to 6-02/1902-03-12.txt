âProspectors returning from - the coast
south of Cape Flattery reported finding
wreckage on the beach near Cape John
son, which consisted of the scroll figure
head of a vessel. On_the side of the
figurehead was a shield similar to that
carried on revenue cutters. It had a blue
background, with gilt stars at the top,
the stripes being red and white. It bore
indication of having been in the water
but a short time. The wood in places
was indented, which indicated that the
vessel, to which! it belonged had been In

tjS the Boers in London regard.
E Delarey's victory* over Methuen
Iff , as an extremely brilliant and
*$^~~nÂ£j important affair, they com-
ment on the battle in a tone of
subdued rejoicing. The foremost of the
secret Dutch emissaries In England said:
"Let no one suppose -we imagine our
selves out of the woods simply because
a Eoer general has overcome a large force
of the enemy commanded by an officer of
high rank and considerable fame. The
4rtcKleiU-~ decides Â¦ netting, -though it nat
urally "deeply stirs the Boer heart a.n3
does something to eradicate the gloom
cf the burghers' bereavements, sacrifices
and trials, but the resolve of the patriots
to accept no humiliating peace wa3 al
ready fixed and irrevocable.
"Lord Kitchener, will need a quarter of
a million additional troops before he will
be able to control South Africa or offer
any sort of safety either to soldiers or
civilians."
MUST SEE IT THROUGH.
There is little disposition to minimize
the Beer victory, but everywhere is heard,
the determination to maintain the tradi
tion that blows serve to strengthen and
stiffen British resolution. Lord Rosebery
struck the popular note to-day in a speech
It-fore the Glasgow students. He admitted
that it was heartbreaking after all the
expenditure of life, time and money, but
he added:
"It witl not dishearten us. We have got
to zee this thing through. We must tako
the blows which fortune deals us with
eauanfmity, showing ourselves worthy of
Letter fortunes."
Lord Rosebery expressed the hope that
more prosperous times were in store, and
that in the future "it would be our prouil
memory that when our country passed
thrcugh the storm, we did not for a mo
ment flinch and were not for an instant
dismayed."
ANXIETY FOR GRENFELL.
Reports from the Continent that the
defeat of General Methuen was followed
by another fight, also favorable to the
Boers, occasion some anxiety, owing to
the absence of news from General Gren
ffcll's column of 1300 men, which left
Klerksdorp to join General Methuen. It
is thought that possibly General Delarey
may have attacked Grenfell. Â¦ v
War Secretary Brodrick. when asked In
the House of Commons to-day what step3
had been taken, In view of the success of
the Boers against Methuen, to send Lord
Kitchener reinforcements, said 6000 yeo
manry would be immediately embarked
with l&rge drafts of cavalry and infantry.
Lord Kitchener would be given all the
assistance he asked for.
SYMPATHY FOR METHUEN.
Baron von Richthofen's Feeling
Words in the Prussian Diet.
BERLIN, March fLâ In the Prussian
Diet to-day the Foreign Secretary, Baron
von RIchthofen, after reading the answer
of the British Government permitting the
delivery of German charitable gifts to the
Boers In the South African concentration
camps under the surveillance of the camp
authorities, declared that the reply guar
anteed a just distribution and added:
"The English and German nations are
connected by 'ties of blood, race an<t
friendship. They are cousins who may
again find themselves side by side. Gen
eral Methuen deserves our complete sym
pathy. As the military attache to the
British Embassy in Berlin he enjoyed the
esteem of Emperors William and Fred
erick."
The sacrifices that Great Britain had
made ' in blood and treasure, said the
Foreign Secretary, made It only humanly
natural that her susceptibilities should be
come more acute. Every harsh word was
uoubly felt by her. . Every friendly ad
dress was accepted with double gratitude.
If the members of the Diet wished to se
cure the co-operation of the British in
, It is understood the city has no ob
jection to the use of the embankment.
The South Side Improvement Club has
been formed, with many influential cit
izens as members, to induce the railroad
to abandon the R street , road altogether
and permit its use as a boulevard. It Is
believed, however, the company intends
to hold on to it for the movement of part
of its freight business.
Judge Ogden decides that McCarthy has
no claim in the premises: that the city
obtained the strip of land many year3
ago for a levee and allowed the railroad
to put a track upon it, and that if any
party has a right to object to the use of
the track it is the city.
SACRAMENTO. March 11.â A decision
filed in the Superior Court of this
county by Judge F. B. Ogden of Alameda
County determines a suit which has long
been pending between Daniel McCarthy,
a wealthy land owner near Brighton, and
the Southern Pacific Company. For more
than thirty-five years the trains from
Placerville and Stockton have come into
Sacramento by way of the R street em
bankment, running the entire length of
the city, and thence along the water
front. Several years ago the railroad
company, to save distance and otherwise
facilitate the handling of its passenger
trains, decided to abandon R street and
run the trains fj-om Brighton Junction
across an old embankment to its main
lines on B street and thence to the depot
An obstacle to this move was raised by
Daniel " McCarthy, who claimed that a
stretch of the embankment running from
Brighton belonged to his farm. Judge*
Ogden was called in to try the case and
a great legal battle was fought, culminat
ing in yesterday's decision.

LORD KITCHENER, COM
. MANDER OF THE BRITISH
TROOPS IN SOUTH AFRICA.
Count von Waldersee has postponed his
journey to the United States for a year.
It is believed that the representations
made by Prince Henry and the courteous
manner in which he has been received will
result in a liberal policy toward Germany
and no objection will be made to Ger
many's security of protection such as
England obtains through the possession
of islands in the West Indies, the French
through Martinique and the Dutch
through Curacao.
German investors complain bitterly that
the Government cannot offer sufficient
protection to warrant them in holding the
property claimed, j
Germany cannot offer protection because
of tb^limitaubns.af. the M!pnr pa- doctrine,
and ' only the ' L'nited States ~is ""able to
convert these roads into dividend-paying
properties and demand justice in South
American courts.
A naval demonstration and aggressive
action are planned as the only way to bring
Brazil to terms. According to leading
German financiers the situation is most
critical. An announcement made several
day ago that the syndicate controlling a
Venezuelan railroad was endeavoring to
sell it to American capitalists is con
firmed. This alarm3 German officials.

way and the Southwest Railway of Brazil

Brazil claims that the German investors
did not fulfill the stipulations of the con
cession and this is sufficient cause to re

BERLIN, March 11.â Strong protests are
being made at the German Foreign Office
by the Disconto Gesellschaft Bank and
other institutions interested in railway
properties in the South American repub
lics. The Disconto Gesellschaft Bank is
now asking protection against the Brazil

on the point of confiscating a railway
which is already in the hands of a re

the Prince's suite of rooms. The company,
had also tastefully decorated the pier.
The Deutschland sailed at 3:45 o'clock.
As she moved away from the ' pier the
cheering was continuous. The Prince ap
peared on the bridge and j bowed. All
down North River the passing tugs and
craft of every description gave the great
liner and her distinguished passenger a
noisy send-off. At the Battery, which

LONDON, March 11.â Delegates from a
number of chambers of commerce visited
the Foreign Secretory/ Lord Lansdowne,
at the Foreign Office to-day and presented
a memorial relative to British trade with
Cuba, pointing out that it was feared that;
when the ; administration of that island
waa handed over to the Cubans a recipro
city treaty would be negotiated, admitting
Cuban products into the United States at
reduced duties, and granting correspond
ing preferential "terms to American pror
duc'ts' and manufactures by Cuba.
"The United States," says the memorial,
"when declaring war on Spain, explicitly
stated that its action would be limited, to
freeing Cuba from Spanish rule. It was
therefore understood by those in | Europe
engaged in trade with Cuba that no meas
ures would be adopted at the conclusion of
the war which would restrict or destroy
their trade with that island.
"Such a reciprocity treaty as that anti
cipated would undoubtedly put an end to
European trade with the island. The
cnambers therefore most earnestly request
that the utmost effort be made by his Ma
jesty's Minister at Washington. to prevent
the signing of any such treaty, or, at
least, to see that the most favored treat
ment of Cuba be continued to this nation.
It is represented that French and German
interests would suffer by a.- reciprocity
treaty and it is suggested a joint protest
might be effectual in preventing a change
adverse to the interests of Europe In trade

Speaker Henderson came forward with
a plea for party, harmony and unity and
moved that the caucus adjourn until next
Tuesday.- LIttlefield of Maine countered
this stroke by proposing, : to - amend ; the
Speaker's motion so as to eliminate Tues
day; which. If carried, would ; have re
sulted in- a sine die adjournments of the
caucus. The amendment -.was .- loÂ«t . and
then the Speaker's motion. to adjourn un
til next Tuesday prevailed, 72 to 54. - The
beet sugar . advocates ' claim a strength
greater than the vote showed, saying the
Speaker's appeal carried- enough votea to
cause . another, recess. During the caucus
In concluding his statement Tayler an
nounced that ne would demand a vote on
his resolution. He received a round of
applause when he concluded. Jenkins of
Wisconsin at this point advanced the
theory that Cuba was now, and had been
since the treaty of Paris, under the sov
ereignty Of the United States. His con
tention was that Cuba was the territory
of 1 he United States; that the people of
Cuba might be permitted to erect a gov
ernment, but not one of sovereignty.
William Alden Smith of Michigan made
a rousing speech\of over an hour against
reciprocity, eliciting frequent applause
from his supporters. While announcing
great admiration for- the President, he in
sisted that there shdiild be no executive
interference with the legislative branch
of the Government. He assailed the-or
ganizers- of " the <. House for leading the
party into disaster and declared, amid
tumultuous applause, that he would de
cline to follow blindly, when the leaders
blundered* He went over the testimony
of Havemeyer, president of the Â¦ sugar
trust, before the Industrial. Commission
In support of some of his. arguments and
paid his respects to some of the mem
bers of the Ways and Means Committee,
who, he asserted, have changed. their po
sitions on the reciprocity question within
the last few weeks. As the evening- ad
vanced considerable ,bad blood was mani
fested. ,The- opponents â¢ Â¦ of reciprocity
seemed confident .of a majority and â¢ were
anxious for a vote, '. while the ; friends Â¦ of
reciprocity counseled against precipitate
action.; >:â¢Â¦ - ',"Â¦Â¦. â¢. - ;
Resolved:* First â That we reaffirm our ad
herence to the Republican national platform
of 1896, insuring adequate protection to jthe
cane and beet sugar industries in the United
States and to the policy of reciprocity as.de
clared in our platform of 1600. '
Second â That we have maintained and will
continue to faithfully discharge the obligation
to Cuba assured by virtue ol the treaty of
Paris and the Platt amendment, and that we
favor such commercial agreements with her
as her Government when established may be
willing to make and which will be in harmony
with our national policy of protection and
reciprocity; and
. Thirdâ That no further action be taken re
specting'' the proposition to reduce the tariff
on Cuban products coming into this country.
Representative Long of Kansas, a mem
ber of the. Ways and Means Committee,
opened with an exhaustive argument in
favor of the 20 per cent concession advo
cated by his colleagues of the Ways and
Means Committee. He argued that the
maintenance of a protective tariff was
not involved in the proposition of the
Ways and Means' Committee, but that the
policy of reciprocity was. "The defeat of
this) bill," said, he, "means that the Re
publican party has refused to follow the
leadership of Blaine, of McKlnley and of
Rcosevelt, and it would mean that reci
procity was no longer a part of the Re-
M-bllcan faith." /
When Long finished speaking Tayler ot
Ohio presented a protest against the plan
of the Ways and Means Committee. The
protest was drafted at the conference
which the Republicans opposed to reci
procity held last night. , ,lt was In the
nature of a manifesto setting out the
grounds on which their opposition was
based, being largely an amplification of
the contention that a reduction' of the
duty on Cuban products involved a relax
ation of the protective principle. In lieu
of the Tawney proposition for a rebate
Tayler offered the following resolution:
WASHINGTON, March U.-About 130
rr.embers were present to-night at the
fourth conference of House Republicans
called to consider the question of Cuban
reciprocity. Speaker Henderson and the
leaders on both sides of the controversy
were in attendance. Representative Can
non of llllonis presided, and. an arrange
ment was made for a division of time be
tween the advocates and opponents of
reciprocity.
"Let us do what we can in the way of
services to humanity," said the Secre
tary, "and then, perhaps, we can go fur
ther. Perhaps we shall be able, without
drawing upon ourselves a sharp rebuff, to
address ourselves as coUsins to our cous
ins on the other-side Of the channel and
speak a good word for our mutual cous
ins, the. Boers." f. . â¢ ".
â¢ " 'I consider It my duty and authorize
you to use my name to declare that I
found the prisoners' camps in Ceylon to
be perfect models. The' former German
/officers in the camps had only a single
complaintâ that there was not sufficient
variety of food.' " , .
Baron von Richthofen proceeded:
"In my opirrion the dignity of the na
tion would not have suffered derogation
if it had displayed some human sym
pathy, as, for instance, yesterday, when
the news came of the severe wounding of
General Methuen. With proper considera
tion for national feelings, it will be pos
sible to make further progress in "the di
rection desired by the Boer relief" com
mittees." . .
The Foreign Secretary concluded with
saying that no obsequiousness was need
ed on the part of Germany, whose policy
was conducted with the object of pleasing'
the German people and no one else. But
he believed that the lines he had laid
down might be followed without any relln
quishment of German views in regard to
the war Itself. '
Continuing, Baron Richthofen said:
"If we feel ourselves more than cousins
to England, we shall be able to more
effectively help our common cousins in
South Africa. Let us not always assume
that everything done by the English is
wrong and bad. I may quote an example.
I have read descriptions of the prisoners'
camps which made my hair stand on end.
A few days ago General von Trotha, who
from his own experience was in a posi
tion to report on the -matter, was at my
house. He said to me:
helping the Boers they must abstain from
provoking Great Britain's susceptibility.
There was a need of a somewhat more
just mode of criticism, of a somewhat
more equitable adjustment of light and
shadow.

Charge.
Roosevelt Vetoes a Bill
to Remove a Grave
Massachusetts Senator
Wants No Vote by
the People.
WASHINGTON, March 1Lâ President
.Roosevelt to-day sent his first veto mes
sage to Congress. It was directed to the
Senate and the bill vetoed was one re
moving' the charge of desertion from the
naval record of John Glass. The message
was as follows:
There can be no graver crime than the
crime of desertion from the army or navy, es
pecially during- war; it is then high treason
to the nation, and is justly punishable by
death. Ko man should be relieved from such
a -crime, especially when nearly forty years
have ii&fcscd since it occurred, save on the
clearest possible proof of his real innocence.
In this case the statement made by the afll
ant before the committee does not In all
points agree with his statement made to the
{Secretary of the Navy.
In any event, it is incomprehensible to me
that he should not have made an effective ef
lort to get back into the navy. He had served
but little more than a month when he de-
Bert ed, and the war lasted for over a year
afterward, yet he made no effort whatever to
pet back Into the war. - Under such cireum
etances it seems to me that to remove the
eharpe of desertion from the navy and give
him an honorable discharge would be to fÂ«l
rlfy the records and do an injustice to his
gallant and worthy comrades who fought the
war to a. finish. The names of the veterans
who foaeht In the Civil War make the honor
list of the republic, and I am not willing to
put upon It the name of a man unworthy of
the high position.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
After the message had been delivered
Senator Gallinger from the Committee on
Naval Affairs read the report of the com
mittee on which the Senate acted. From
that statement it appeared that Glass en
hsfed in January. 1864, when only 18 year=
old, and that having witnessed an act
which compromised the second officer of
the ship he was taken-ashore in March of
that year by that officer and told not to
report again for duty. The committee
cay'- that this order together with Glass*
?outh was responsible for his desertion.
SAVANNAH. Mo., March 11.â One of the
State's best witnesses in the case of Stew
art Fife, charged with the murder of
Frank W. Richardson, is missing and it is
believed he has disappeared to avoid tes
tifying.
The witness is E. E. Norris of St. Jos
eph, a saloon-keeper. Norris was expected
to swear that Fife was in his saloon be
fore the killing of Richardson and had
made threats of taking Richardson's life.
Norris did not respond when his name
was called to-day and Jidge Burnes is
cued -an attachment, for him. Norris was
not found, and the word come back that
he had disappeared. - The time to-day was
epent in tracing Fife's travels about Sa
vannah on the night of the murder.

, WHEN THE COURT CALLS
WASHINGTON, March 11.â For sev
eral hours to-day the Senate had the ship
subsidy bill under consideration. Mai
lory of Florida made an extended speech
in opposition to the measure. , He held
that there was no good reason for Its en
actment into law, saying he believed it
would not accomplish the result hoped
for it by its promoters.
Prior to consideration of the ship sub
sidy measure a lively debate occurred
over an effort on the part of Berry of
Arkansas 1 to ascertain when the Com
mittee on Privileges and Elections* might
be expected to report to the facr.ate the
resolution providing for the election of
Senators by the direct vote of the people.
Hoar Indicated his vigorous opposition
to such a resolution on the ground that
it would subvert the fundamental prin
ciple upon which the Senate was founded.
The House entered upon the consider
ation of the . postofflce appropriation bill,
but, as usual during general debate on
an appropriation bill, the members who
spoke devoted themselves to everythhing
except the bill before the House. Early
in the day Thayer of Massachusetts at
tempted to take advantage of the divis
ion among the Republicans on the sub
ject of reciprocity by bringing forward a
resolution to investigate reports that the
sugar trvst would be the chief beneficiary
of Cuban reciprocity. He tried to over
turn a decision of the Speaker in order
to secure action on his resolution, but
the Republicans came up solidly against
t-uch a course and he was checkmated.
Brantley, a Georgia Democrat, made a
speech in favor of Cuban reciprocity, and
Meyer, a Louisiana Democrat, one
a gainst it. Hill of Connecticut made
some remarks on his monetaary bill.
The feature of the day, however, was
a speech by Burlesor* attacking Secre
taary Hay for declining to request the
British authorities to furnish a passport
to go through the British lines to the
Rev. Hiram W. Thomas and wife, who
desire to go to South Africa to distribute
Boer relief funds collected in Illinois.
Hitt of Illinois, chairman of the Foreign
Affairs Committee, made a spirited reply
to Burleson, charging the Texas member
with attempting to prejudice the case be
fore the evidence was in. 1

BRITAIN TO SEND REINFORCEMENTS
VISALIA, March 11.â Fashionable
' society in this city is on the
qui vive because of a brilliant
- wedding which is to occur to
morrow, evening, with Miss Mary
Edna Farrow and William Lee Fisher as
the principals. The bride-to-be is the
daughter of Dr. and Mrs. E. D. Farrow.
She is a graduate of a San Francisco
conservatory and is an accomplished mu
sician. She is a member of the Visalla
Altgeld declared that all friends of hu
manity owed a debt of gratitude to Gov
ernor Yates for issuing a proclamation so
liciting assistance for the Boer women
and children In concentration camps
which the British maintain In South
Africa. He further said the people of
America had raised a large sum of money
with which to relieve the distress of Boer
women and children, but were unable to
send it to them because Lord Pauncefote,
British Embassador at Washington, ob
jected to it. Altgeld further charged that
Lord Pauncefote has for several years
meddled In American affairs, and that the
State Department and Secretary Hay
were mere vest-pocket conveniences for
the British Embassador.
It was found that both of the patient's
legs were paralyzed. Several years ago
Altgeld suffered- a similar paralytic
stroke In Chicago, also at the close of a
speech, but his condition at that time was
riot as serious as now.
Governor began his speech with : vigor.
Toward the close he stammered, and just
as he had finished he fell.
After the wedding a dinner will be
given at the home of the bride. The
couple will start on their wedding trip at
midnight, going southward on the Owl
train.
The marriage will be the climax of a
courtship extending over a period of six
years. The wedding will Â¦ occur at 8:30
o'clock at St. Paul's Episcopal Churon-
The bride will be attired in an elaborate
gown of white peau de sole en traine,
trimmed with wide silk applique and pearl
passementerie, a rope of pearls encircling
the waist, a deep yoke of embroidered
mousseline de sole, and a gorgeous white
veil to envelop the entire figure.
Miss Daisy Farrow, a sister of the
bride, will be the maid of honor. She
will be attired in pink grenadine, trimmed
with duchess lace, and will carry a bou
quet of white nephetos roses. Miss Maude
Brown of Visalla and Miss Annie Barrett
of Palo Alto will be " bridesmaids. They

CUBA PRESENTS
A NEW PROBLEM
"It is viewed with gratitude and re
spect. The United States has, from the
first, insisted on the open door policy for
all nations and a Russian Manchuria
would be directly opposed to such a pol
icy. We have implicit confidence in the
bona fides of America in this matter as
in others,, and are persuaded that the
United States will back- us up In the
stand we have taken. The United States
is, we hold,, the one absolutely unselfish
and strictly just power. We have had
frequent proofs of the correctness of this
view."
"What is thought in Japan of the atti
tude taken by the United States in. this
connection?" '
"That province* must be kept < entirely
under Chinese control, not only because
of its mineral, and other wealth, but be
cause of its being the birthplace of the
present Chinese dynasty. - Continued oc
cupation of Manchuria by any foreign
power whatever would mean the downfall
of the present dynasty .and subsequent
revolution and anarchy. I am convinced
kthat the tanure of Manchuria as a Chi
! hese state is positively necessary to the
maintenance and continuance of the pres
ent Chinese Government."
"Japan will never consent to a Russian
Manchuria," said the Prince. ''Oh this
point the Government is absolutely de
termined. Nor should we hesitate to take
recourse to . armed remonstrance were
Russia to continue in her recent semi
detiant attitude. We have the sympathy
of both the United. States and Great Brit^
ain and know what we are doing, s :
"Japan has no objection whatever to
Russia's leasing Port Arthur. It would
not in any. way menace our interests. As
for the trans-Manchurian railway, we re
gard its construction with lively satis
faction, in that 'Â¦ it will unquestionably
serve to open new fields for foreign indus
trial and commercial undertakings. But
Russia would have to maintain troops
along the railway in order to keep it from
attacks on the part of the natives."
"Would Japan object to Russian troops
in Manchuria for this purpose?"
"Not at all where the presence bf such
troops is necessary, as is the. case with
the railroad. Japan would never object
to their presence. But Russia's great ter
ritorial army on Chinese soil must be
withdrawn, beyond the frontier, and that
without further, loss of time. .

Test for Yourself the Wonderful
Curative Properties of Swamp-Root
To Prove What Swamp-Root, the Wor.'d- Famous Kidney and Bladder '.Remedy/-
Will Do for YOU, Every Reader of The Call May Have a Sample Bottle Free.
Dr. Kilmer & Co., Binghamton, N. Y.: . "
Gentlemen â In justice to you I feel it is my duty to send you an acknowledgment of the receipt of /the
sample bottle of Swamp-Root you st) kindly sent me. I had been out of health for the past five years with kid-
i new and bladder trouble. Had our best physicians prescribe for me. They would relieve me. for the time being,
but the old complaint would in a short time return again. I sent for a sample bottle of Swamp-Root, and I found
1 it did me a world of good. Since then I have taken eight small bottles bought at my drug store, and I consider
j myself perfectly cured. It seemed as though my back would break in two after stooping. I do not have the
I smarting and irritation, nor do I have to get up during the night to urinate, as I formerly did three or. four
times a night, but now sleep the sleep of peace. My back is all right again, and in every way lam a new man.
Two of my brother officers are still using Swarrip-Root. They, like myself, cannot say too much in praise of it.
It is a boon to mankind. We recommend it to all who are suffering from kidney and bladder diseases.
My brother officers (whose signatures accompany this letter), as well as myself, thank you for the blessing' you
have brought to the human race in the compounding of Swamp-Root. JAMES COOK.

as your kidneys are well they will help all the other organs to health. A trial will convince any one.
Weak and unhealthy kidneya are responsible for many kinds of diseases, and if permitted to continue much suffering
; with fatal results are sure to follow. Kidney trouble irritates the nerves, makes you dizzy, restless, sleepless and Irri-
table. Makes you pass water often during the day and obliges you to get up many times during the night. Unhealthy
; kidneys catise rheumatism, gravel, catarrh of the bladder, pain or. dull ache in the back, joints and muscles; makes your
hÂ£su ache and back ache, causes indigestion, stomach and liver trouble; you get a sallow, yellow complexion, makes you
feel as though you had heart trouble; you may have plenty of ambition, but no strength; get weak and waste away.
Swamp-Root is pleasant to talce and is used In the leading hospitals, recommended by physicians in their private
practice, and is taken by doctors themselves, because they recognize in it the greatest and most successful remedy that
science has ever been able to compound. - â¢ , â¢ . , .
If you are already convinced that Swamp-Root is what you need, you can purchase the regular fifty-cent and one-
dollar size bottles at the drug stores everywhere. Don't make any mistake, but remember the name, Swamp-Rootâ Dr
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, and the address, Binghamton, N. T., on every bottle.

PEEKSKILL, N. T., March 11.â One
burglar was shot and killed and another
was wounded by a policeman- here early
to-day. The men had broken Into the
hardware store of Durham Bros, and were
seen by two policemen. The burglars tried
to escape and fired two shots at the
policemen, one of whom returned the fire.
The dead man was Clarence Outhouse, 30
years old, of Peekskill. His companion,
who is under arrest, refuses to give his
name. He was shot in the hand.

On Saturday night, shortly before Miss
"White left home for the telephone office.
Fhe informed her mother that she would
eat breakfast the next morning with Tup
pur. That she met Tupper after her
right's work, ate breakfast with him and
then took a Madison-street" car for the
lakf is known. They hired the boat from
C. Warmington at the Eagle boathouse.
Thev evidently had some point across the
lake as their destination. They spoke of
fr.e ferry, but were informed that the
ferry was not running that day. Tupper
romurked that it was the rowboat or
nothing. Â¦. ; ".,-"^
TVarmington declares it would have
been absolutely impossible for the boat
to turn turtle in the water without the
aid of human hands. He said one of the
couple misrht have leaned over the side
or Miss White might have become fright
ened and in clinging to her companion
caused the catastrophe. But, whatever.
the cause, there waa not wind enough
blowing at any time during the day to
c>"erturn the boat.
There is a. theory that the j-oung couple
made cne*of the islands in the lake and
tied the boat to a near-shore tree. If they
wanted people to believe that they had
drowned, with an end to elopement, that
Â¦v^ould be a natural conclusion. At any
fate one end of the rope used to anchor
the craft had either been cut or had been
broken. It was not In that condition when
it left the boathouse.

money, which he distributed liberally for
drinks. While all were drinking, the land
lady asserts, 'she " saw Widney put some
liquid in Hanson's beer. He told her that
It was "knock-out", drops; that Hanson
had $1000 in cash on his person and that
if she would keep quiet he would get the
money and give her half of it. The wo
man pretended to fall * into the scheme,
but she changed Hanson's beer and then
sent for two of his friends to come and
take charge of him. Widney objected to
the friends taking Hanson away, but the
two men insisted^ Widney proposed . to
the woman to rob all rich men who
visited her place. Mrs. Donahue lost no
time In notifying the police and â¢ Captain
Bradish went to the place and made ar
rangements for trapping Widney.

FEW MINUTES.
By sudden coughs we mean those which
come unexpectedly. You wake up in the
nigrht or get up in the, morning with a
cough. As a general thing, such coughs
i become firmly seated, in a few hours, and
you are in for a week's 'siege of cough-
ing. If not for an attack of bronchitis,
pneumonia or consumption."
All such coughs can be stopped in the
beginning by placing, a HTOMEI inhaler
in the mouth and breathing/naturally for
fifteen or twenty : minutes. This will 'kill
the germs causing the cough, almost im-
mediately. ' Â¦
If the cough comes on night, place 20
drops of HYOMEl on'a piece of flannel,
pin to the night robe and retire. In the
morning all trace of the cough will have
disappeared.;
Croup cannot exist for. one hour if the
above directions. are followed.^
Ordinary coughs which have . become
seated are, cured in ; twenty-four hours. ; :
. Catarrh and bronchitis , require ' treat-
ment for from three to fifteen days only.
: The advance of consumption is stopped
in six days, and the germs of, the disease
completely eradicated in a very 'few
weeks.'; .; . . ' , Â¦' " i' '
Â¦Send to The R. TV Booth Co., Ithaca, 'N.'.T.,
for five â¢ days' treatment " free, ' or â¢_ purchase â¢ a
HTOMEI outfit from your druggist. You will
never need or ever use- any other. medicine for
such diseases after testing this new ; cure.*; ,
AD V EK'-H EvRmHRNTS.
THE STARVtfflOK~PLAN
Of Treating Dyspepsia and Stomach Troubles
. Is Useless and Unscientific.
The almost certain failure of the starvation
cure for dyspepsia, has been .proven time and
Rgain, but even now a course of dieting is gen-
erally the first thing recommended for a case
Â«f indigestion or any Etoma.cn trouble.
Mary people with weak digestion, as well as
some physicians, consider the first step to take
in attempting to cure indigestion Is to restrict
the diet, either by selecting certain foods and
rejecting others or to cut down the amount of
food eaten to barely enough to keep eoul and
body together, in other words the starvation
plan Is by many supposed to be the first es-
sential.
All this is radically wrong. It is foolish and
L unscientific to recommend dieting to a man al-
â¢ ready suffering from starvation because in-
digestion itself Etarves every organ, nerve and
fiber in the body.
What people with poor digestion most need is
abundant nutrition, plenty of good, wholesome,"
properly cooked food, and something to assist
the weak stomach to digest it.
This is exactly the purpose for which Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets are adapted and the true
reason why they cure the worst cases of stom-
ach trouble.
Eat a sufficient amount of wholesome food
â¢ n<l after each meal take one or two of Stuart's
Dyrpepsla Tablets to promptly digest It
In this way the system is nourished and the
overworked stomach rested, because the tablets
will digest the food whether the stomach works
'or not, one grain of the active digestive prin-
ciple In Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets being suf-
ficient to digest 3<X)0 grains of meat, eggs or
other albuminous food.
Dr. Harlandson and Dr. Redwell recommend
these tablets in all cases of defective digestion
because the pepsin and diastase In them are
absolutely free from animal matter and other
impurities, and being pleasant to the taste
are as cafe and harmless for the child as for
the adult.
All drugstore* cell this excellent preparation
and the daily use of them after meals will be of
great benefit, not only as an Immediate relief
but to permanently build up and invigorate the
dieeEtive organs.

LONDON. March 11.â King Edward's
steeplechaser Ambush II, favorite for the
Liverpool Grand National, -pulled up lame
thia morning after a trial at Newmarket.
The betting on Ambush II this morning
was 6 to 1 against, but the odds dropped
this afternoon to 20 to 1 againat. The
King's trainer, Lushlngton, says it is too
near to make a definite statement as to
the extent of the horse's injury, but he
trusts Ambush II will be all right in a
day or two. Later in. the day it was an
nounced that Ambush , II had been
scratched for the Grand National.
King Edward's Horse Is Lame.
United States . Local Inspectors Bolles
and Bulger rendered a decision yesterday
suspending for thirty days the license of
Captain O. W. Parker of the steamer
Washtenaw. On March 1, this year, the
Washtenaw, drawing twenty-four feet of
water, was on her Way from the wharf in
San Francisco to Port Costa, when a
strong tide carried her against Invincible
Rock, doing but little damage to the ves
sel. Owing to Â¦ the circumstances sur
rounding the case and the good reputation
of Captain Parker as a careful and con
scientious navigator, the inspectors
thought that thirty dayB* suspension of
his license was a sufficient punishment.
Captain Parker's Punishment.
The City Attorney then advised the
board, that, in order to legally gain an ex
tension of, time and to secure a modifica
tion of ..the original ' plans it would be
necessary to obtain .the j consent of not
only the executors, but of the heirs of
the estate as well. No further action was
taken by the board and it was understood
bythe Sutro heirs, that the matter would
bo allowed to lapse. The action of the
workmen in driving posts In the roadway
at Corbett road and near Laguna Honda
is indicative of the intention of the ex
ecutors of the Sutro estate to regain pos
session of the large tract of land
which was deeded to the city under con
ditions which have not been carried out
The Board of Public Works wa3 in
formed yesterday -by Police Officer Shee
han that a force of surveyors and as
sistants were at work on Dewey boule
vard planting posts near its junction with
Corbett road with a view to closing up
the thoroughfare. This action is the re
sult of the failure of the city and '"county
to complete the construction of the boule
vard within a certain specified time. The
date when the work- was to have been
finished expired March 1, and in addition
no funds have been appropriated by the
Board of Supervisors for the purpose of
improving the right of way deeded by the
late Adolph Sutro.
Recently the Board of Supervisors de
sired to obtain an extension of time with
in which to carry out the city's part of
the agreement. The executors of the es
tate.were willing to grant this extension
and also consented to a modification of
the original plans whereby the original
width of the boulevard was to be ma
terially lessened.

Young's mare had his odds hammered
down from evens to 7 to 10. and ran abso
lutely last." "Jess" Matthews, on Edin
borough, a 12 to 1 shot, got away in the
lead and stayed there. Parsifal, the long
est priced one of the bunch," beat Bragg
four lengths 'Â¦ for the place.
"Longshot" Conley played the star role
in the afterpiece, a mile selling number.
He had the mount on Loyal S, the 1C to 5
second choice, and, beating the others to
the path, won at the wire from Courtier in
a driw. Duke of York, the favorite, fin
ished third. SKiSS '
Birlcenruth rode a well judged race on
Sunello, capturing the mile and fifty yard
selling affalrwith Mat Storm's horse at
odds of 5 to 1. He trailed Tyranus to
the bend for home and then cutting loose
picked up the Inside position and ridden
out disposed of Lodestar by a couple of
lengths. Hungarian, the favorite, had to
trial in the deep going and was not promi
nent any part of it. .
On form Ned Dennis looked best of
the six starters in the sev/m-furlong event
and was installed a 7 to 10 favorite. The
gelding ran his race, but was outfooted
from start to finish by The Singer, a 15
to 1 shot, piloted by Troxler. Killeen, a
60 to 1 Shot, dropped into the show.
For the opening sprint Mocorlto, the
mount of Ransch, was extensively touted,
closing a 9 to 10 favorite. She displayed
some of her old-time speed for half a mile
and then collapsed. Conley, on Antolee,
a well played one, took the rail position In
the stretch, beating Hoar, astride; Rasp,
in a hard drive.
Delsegno. from the Chlnn & Forsythe
stable, bankrupted half of the combina
tion players by going down to defeat in
the two-year-old scramble at odds of 9 to
20. Conley, who had the mount, did not
get away well and was then hemmed in
on the rail behind Guida and Clarinette.
At the wire Gulda scored by half a length,
with the favorite second, a length before
Clarinette.. Â¦-â¢ -;v -â¢â¢Â¦â¢ . Â¦
that made of it a veritable quag
mire. Yesterday, as on a similar occasion
some days ago, there was a comparatively
dry strip next the rail and the rider that
succeeded in seizing it invariably landed
his mount first at the wire. Upsets were
expected and nobody was disappointed,
for a perfect deluge of long shots
swamped the first choices. "Billy" Ma
grane'R vocal phenomenon, The Singer,
carried off the honors by scoring at odds
of 15 and 20 to 1.
SLOWLY and in pa ches the sur
face of the track at Oakland is
assuming its accustomed velvety
appearance after the fierce storms
Alec Pape. champion amateur oarsman
of the Pacific Coast, is contemplating en
tering the professional ranks. He is now
considering a challenge from, Henry Pe
terson to row a mile and half race In
shells over the Oakland estuary. Peter
son has challenged Pape to race for $1003
and a percentage of the gate receipts.
In the event Pape accepts the challenge
the ranks of the amateur oarsmen will
sustain a heavy loss. Pape is easily thÂ«
best amateur oarsman on the coast. For
the past four years he has represented
the Dolphin and Olympic clubs in rowing
regattas and has always been victorious.
Peterson is engaged In the boating busi
ness, but has not been In a shell for
months. Five or six years ago he com
peted against such cracks as Gaudaur,
O'Connor, Stansbury and Hanlan. Ha
ranked with them In ability and won
many races. The interest In professional
rowiag dwindled and Peterson decided to
retire. He would have remained in retire
ment but for the fact that many devotees
of rowing expressed a desire to see him
row again.
There is 1 no one more worthy to contsst
with Peterson than young Pape. He has
youth and strength and can pull an oar
with the beat of them. In all his races he
has far outclassed his opponents. He has
defeated such good men as Ayers of thÂ«
Alameda Boat Club, Dr. Dennis of the
South Ends and McCausland of the Ariel-*.
He defeated the champion of the North
west in his own water and has won a
score of trophies by his skill with the
oar. His time for a mile equals that
made by Peterson In his palmy days.
The members of the Olympic Club are
trying to dissuade Pape from taking thÂ©
step, but if he decides to do so they will
show the same enthusiasm they did when
Jimmy Britt entered his professional
career.

for Fiji with 600 mules aboard, has ar

Fiji, February 22, had favorable weather
throughout the trip and . lost only five
mules. There was some . difference of
opinion as to the seaworthiness of the
Willowdene before she sailed. Her cap
tain refused to take her out and the
worry following the transformation of his
vessel Into a floating barn drove him In
sane. From Fiji the Willowdene will pro

of her mule-carrying experiment, she will

Several brokers who came to make en
try of goods recently shipped from the
Philippines were very much disappointed
when they applied at the Custom-house
yesterday to llnd-that they would have
to r>ay the duties. The Supreme Court of
the United States decided a few months
ago that the Philippines were United
States territory and that duties could not
be collected on goods arriving from that
country until Congress should enact the
necessary legislation. The recommenda
tion of the Supreme Court has been com
plied with by Congress and henceforth
cigars and other valuable and extensive
products of the islands will be required
to pay 75 per cent of the rate imposed by
the Dingley tariff bill.
"Require and assess Dingley rates on
all goods except articles of growth or
product of the archipelago, on which col
lect 75 per cent of Dingley rate, less ex
port duty or tax collected on shipment.
Hold duties as separate fund to be paid
into Philippine treasury. Accept draw
back entries. Allow withdrawal for ex
portation of goods from bonded ware
house and from bonded manufacturing
warehouse." . â¢ <
The new Philippine tariff bill went into
effect March 8, but Customs Inspector
Stratton was not officially advised of, that
fact until yesterday, when he received a
dispatch from Washington signed by O.
I/. Spaulding, Assistant Treasurer, read
ing as follows: Â» â¢

Fortunately, the Transit people were
keeping a sharp lookout, and Captain Cor
velll soon had his signal bells ringing out
a warning tune. The signals were prompt
ly obeyed, and the Transit slipped by
across the Albatross' bow. As the.Tran
sit's stern sheered round it came in con
tact with the boom of the Government
vessel. Several windows were ripped out
of the car transport and the side of her
house was stove in. - The Transit then
swung clear and continued her trip. The
Albatross lost a couple of head stays.
The accident occurred about 5:30 a. m.,
when the fog was at its densest. The Al
batross was anchored off Folsom street.
Her white hull so blended with the mist
as to render her almost Invisible a boat's
length away. The stillness was suddenly
broken by the churning of paddle wheels,
and before the lookout on the Albatross
could even sing out a warning the Tran
sit loomed up in the fog on the port side
and heading directly for the Government
vessel.
&~^ HE Southern Pacific car transport
I Transit collided yesterday morn
1 ing with the United States Fish
j| Commission steamship Albatross
and narrowly' escaped putting the
latter out of commission. As it turned
out, most of the damage was sustained
by the Transit. The Albatross was able
to go to sea shortly after noon, accord
ing to programme.

REDLAKDS. March " 1Lâ The Chicago
Symphony Orchestra, under the auspices
of the Spinnet Club Ladies, a musical or
ganization of Rcdlands, gave a concert
last night. While the orchestra was pack
ing Hs belongings after the performance
Constable Koehler appeared behind the
scenes with attachment papers issued by
Justice Tlsdale for a claim of $165. The
papers were taken out by F. C. O'Kelley.
t-ecretary for Frank A. Miller, manager
of the Loring Opera-house in Riverside.
The company agreed to show. there on
Saturday night, but failed to fill the bill
after Manager Miller had extensively ad
vertised the attraction.
When Koehler presented his legal docu
ments and proceeded to take possession
of everything in sight belonging to the
musicians, they objected and tried 10
force him from the stage. Koehler drew
a revolver and, leveling it at the angered
musicians, caused them to stand back.
After considerable confusion the papem
were served on the manager and un at
tachment was placed upon a box of sheet
muelc valued at ttiOO. This delayed the
rompany's start for Arizona on a epenai
train that awaited It at thÂ© Southern I a

Judge Cook did not sign the death war
rant yesterday for the execution of Chew
Lan Ong. who pleaded guilty to murder.
The prisoner's attorney. H. H. McCioskey,
has intimated his intention of applying
for a writ of prohibition. The warrant
will be signed this morning, fixing June
b as the date of execution.
Attorney McCioskey says he will take
exception to the Judge's action, and bring
the matter before the Supreme Court. He
will raise the point, that section 190 of the
Penal Code, whlcfi purports to give tho
Judge the same powers as a Jury when a
defendant pleads guilty is unconstitu
tional as it deprives the defendant of
hla right to be tried by a Jury of his
The construction of this section of the
Penal Code has been afllrrmd by the
Bupreme Court of this State. A similar
section In the Penal Code of Dakota Ter
ritory was also amrmed by the Supreme
Court there, and It was further held tnat
when a defendant pleaded guilty to mur
der the penalty should be death. 1
A novel point also to be raised by Me-
Clobkey is that in the death warrant no
one Is given authority to execute a de
fendant and that for years back all de
fendants have been illegally executed.
Under the old law the Sheriff was directed
in see that the warrant wus executed, but
n riinn l;'27 was amended to read as fol
lows: " â¢
"When Judgment of death is rendered
a warrant signed by the Judge and m
tested by the clÂ«*rk under the Mini nf
the court must be drawn nnd delivered
to the Sheriff. It must state the convic
tion nnd Judgment and appoint a day on
which tin- Judgment Is to bo executed,
which must not be less than sixty days,
nor more than ninety dnys from th* tlma
of Judgment, and must direct the Hherlff
to deliver the defendant within ten days
from the time of judgment to the Warden
of one of tho State prisons of this Btitte
for execution, such prison to be designat
ed In the warrant."
McCloskey claims that if power Is given
in this section to. any ono to carry the
warrant Into effect it in to the Warden
of the Btate's prison, who In tmt an officer
of the court like the Sheriff, but an em*
ploye of the prison directors, and there
fore without lrgal authority.

Under Our State Law.
Alexander Anderson Â«nd Mrs. Laura,
M. Welch traveled all the way from Van
couver, Wash., to be married In this
city, only to learn that the ceremony
could not be performed in California, be
cause under the laws Mrs. Welch Is
ineligible. The couple applied to "Cupid"
Danforth yesterday for a marriage II
cense, and in replying to the usual queries
propounded it developed that Mrs. Welch
had bren divorced from her husband Just
lour weeks ago.
Danforth informed the couple that it
would be necessary to reside one year in
this State before Mrs. Wolch would be
legally entitled to marry. Mrs. Welch ap
peared surprised, as she was under the
Impression that there was no law In
California forbidding the immediate mar
riage of a divorced person. She said that
the law in Washington prohibited such
marriages within six months after the
signing of the decree. In order to escape
That condition the couple had come here,
but. as it proved, under a misapprehen
sion.
"You will have to go to Reno, Xev.,"
raid Danforth, "If you want to marry
right away."
"Well, that's exactly what we will do."
replied Anderson. "We have traveled 633
miles from Vancouver, and I guess the
extra 244. miles to Reno will not hurt us."
The disappointed couple then left the
office with the intention of purchasing
tickets on the evening overland for Reno.
Thev were accompanied by a one-year-old
tmbr, Mrs. Welch's child by her divorced
husband. â¢ .
ALEXANDER IS CONVICTED
ON CHARGE OF SMUGGLING
His Counsel Attacks the Indictment.
and Judge de Haven. Rules
Against Him.
Joseph Alexander was convicted yester
day by a Jury In the United States Dis
trict Court of having received smuggled
goods. Bert Schlesinger. who represented
the defendant, moved to dismiss the case
on the- ground that section 30S2, under
which the indictment had been drawn, ap
plied only to goods whose importation
was prohibited by law and not to goods
that were smuggled. Judge de Haven, In
denying the motion to dismiss, said: - > '
"On the question presented to me for
Instruction that the facts proved do not
bring the case within section 3082, United
States Revised Statutes, there seems to
be a conflict of authority. Many cases
are held to be in accordance with the co.i
tention of the defendant, but I am in
clined to believe that the better reason-
Ing is to be found in those cases which
hold to the contrary."
Alexander was ordered to appear for
sentence this morning at 11 o'clock.
George Alexander, brother of the prisoner,
will come up for trial at that time. Jo
seph Alexander was found in possession
of a quantity of silk caps that had been
smuggled.
Whether Ohnimus is in contemDt for
refusing to give the name of his inform
ant Is a question that will be considered
during the week.
Over an hour was spent by the grand
jurors in discussing the situation, not a
particle of evidence being produced in sup
port of the published charges. While
many were in favor of dropping the mat
ter, the majority decided to take it up
again next Tuesday, when a number of
police officers and the reporter who is sup
posed to have written the article in ques
tion will be called.
"I thought they might cite me for con
tempt." said Ohnimus after leaving the
Jury-room, but I had a dozen or more
sections of the code to support my re
fusal."
Commissioner Ohnlmua was tho lnst wit
n<?M. It was KxiHTirMi tiiui Ohnimus
would I'i'vi'iil tho niiiin' of IiIh informant,
bvit ii>Â» dalmed the right uiulor the 1'ulltl
<itl 1 'inin to withhold iitiy information of
that character. Several of Â¦ th" ununi
jurors thought otherwlte, but Ohnimuii
Mild ho had plenty ot Authorities to sup*
port his contention. He said in renponno
to h number of uuestiong:
"Tho law provides that where 0110 pub-

that Mifrctn tin- lnteretitH of tho people ur
In for the public -Rood it 1* his duty to
keep the same to himself, or use It bm he
deems best for the public good."
This rather staggered the grand jurors
and Ohnimus was dropped.
Chief of Police Wittman was next put
on the stand. Ills examination was a lit
tle more lengthy than that of the Mayor,
but elicited nothing of importance. He
was closely questioned by Juror Wood
ward and said that the first Intimation
he had of the alleged existence of a fund
was derived from a morning paper.
"I aaked sumo ot my men, upon whose
word I can rely, if there was any attempt
being made to ralue money in the depart*
mem," Bald Wittman, "and one and all
nniÂ«i 'no,' I waited to hear from the
Mayor, but hÂ« did not communicate with
me. 'i in 11 1 waited for the (irand Jury, 1
am now prepared to tell you gentlemen
thorn Ih nothing in the story."
Chief I'Jxiunliif r Moron and Commission*

called mill questtonud. None of them
knew anything about the matter And (ill
KhKmi for IIkIi 1 upon thÂ« subject. Lena

tho cxumlnutloii of the three.
Shortly after the Grand Jury assembled
Mayor Schmitz was called as the nrst wit 7
ness. He was detained just three min
utes. Ho said the rumor of the existence
of a corruption fund had reached him and
that he had caused an Investigation to be
made. He could not, however, tind any
thing to substantiate tho rumor. Â¦
Civil Service Commissioner Ohnimus de
clined yesterday afternoon to give the
Grand Jury the name of the police officer
who he claims informed him that a cor
ruption fund of i6000 was being raised in
the Police Department for the purpose of
influencing the Civil Service Commission

_, 957 !o 977 MarKct Street, Opp. Golden Gate Avenue JGeneral W. H. L. Barnes presided at
the regular meeting of the Board of Re
gents of the State University held at
Hopkins Institute yesterday afternoon,
and on behalf of. the board welcomed the
newly appointed Regent, Charles S.
Wheeler, to membership in the body.
The committee which was appointed to
draft a fitting memorial in honor of the
late Professor Joseph Le Conte, who died
In the Tosemite Valley last year, report
ed. The memorial was an eloquent and
dignified tribute to tho character and
career of the great scientist, whose con
nection with the university shed so much
luster upon it. It was. read by General
Barnes, who was one ' of the committee
which framed it, and at the conclusion a
burst of applause broke from the staM
body whose sentiments it was intended
to express. The report of the commit
tee was adopted and the memorial or
dered spread' upon the records.
President "Wheeler . reported the ap
pointment of Emanuel B. Lama'r as as
sistant professor In French for five
months at a salary of $50 per month. This
was to fill the vacancy caused by the
resignation of . James Hopper, Ph.B., "OS.
who is to go. to the Philippines on nomi
nation of the university as a teacher of
English. J. D. Mortimer, assistant in
electrical engineering, discontinued his
work January 29, but no appointment was
recommended to fill the place.
President Wheeler announced that the
Charter day address would be delivered
by Dr. Bliss Perry, editor of the Atlantic
Monthly. The report of the finance com
mittee on the finances of the medical de
partment was accepted. _^
The committee on the Flood endowment
was authorized to grant a right of way
over certain marsh , lands in San Mateo
County to the Spring Valley Water Com
pany, and the Regents decided that none
of the Flood endowment property would
be leased for hotel purposes. It was or
dered that a "collection from fhe univer
sity museum should be sent to the St.
Louis Exposition.
On motion of Regent Budd the by-lawb
were amended, calling for monthly meet
ings of the board In lieu of bi-monthly as
heretofore. '. . â¢
The ; board held an executive session
lasting an 'hour, but nothing was given
out regarding what transpired.

Resort in the world, offers best living, climate

The increase of divorces has been accompanied by
a decrease of the birth rate, in several of the older
States. The report says: "The slow growth or posi
tive decrease in the members' of Sunday-schools and
some other agencies of the churches has drawn at
tention to the low birth rate that prevails in some of
our States, especially in that class of. population
known as the native sleek. Some of our States show
a birth rate so much lower that of France,
where thesubject has become a matter of grave pub
lic concern, that it has been assigned as the chief; or,
leading cause for the decline of Sunday-schools and
of public schools in country towns, arid perhaps" of
other associations made up of the young."
Such are some of thc. : tendencies of the people -to
Comparatively few States collect statistics concern
ing marriage and divorce, and consequently the re
port does not deal with that phase of the subject in
anything like a comprehensive way. Such figures
as are given, however, arc suggestive. In Connects
cut, where at one time tne ratio of divorces to mar
riages was I to 9, it is now 1 to 15. In Rhode Island,
on the other hand, divorces are increasing and are
now in the ratio to marriages of 1 to 8. In Massa
chusetts the ratio is 1 to* 20, but it is increasing. In
New Jersey it is 1 to 50. Some of the Western States
are as bad as Rhode- Island. In Oklahoma the ratio
is 1 to 10.9; in Michigan 1 to 9.6; while Indiana has
the worst record of all with a ratio of x to 5.7.
While the trend of legislation is thus reported to
be favorable to the views of those who seek to
diminish the frequency of divorces, the secretary an
nounces that he is unable to report the adoption of
the proposed "uniform law of divorce procedure" by
a single State as yet. He attributes this to the fact
that the "Commissions on Uniformity" in the various
States are directing their attention mainly to bring
ing about the adoption of uniform statutes relating to
negotiable bills, and have not pressed the "divorce
procedure" bill.
FROM the annual report of the corresponding
secretary of the National League for the Protec
tion of the Family, it appears that during the
past. year there has been a decided increase of interest
in the work of the league and in the problems it has
undertaken to solve. Several of the "States have
changed their divorce laws by amending them in the
right direction. Referring to Florida, the report
says: "The acts of the last Legislature are not yet at
hand, but it is creditably reported^ that this State has
at the instance of a rich citizen made insanity a
ground for divorce, but not without vigorous pro
test. This is the only step backward in the year's
legislation."
BIRTH RATES AND DIVORCE.
Whatever the British may do,' however, Delarey's
victory counts as a 'mighty stride /toward the inde
pendence, of his country.; He has outmaneuvered his
foes, broken through the lines of their blockhouses,
met "them in battle and defeated them under condi
tions where the fighting was a fair test of the sol
dierly qualities of the two armies. Men who can
achieve- such victories need; not" despair ; of , their
country, -no matter, how great be the material odds
against'them. Those prophets, therefore,:who have
been counting on a speedy collapse of the war by
reason ; of Kitchener's dragnet ; will now have" k
chance to. meditate upon the folly of basing prophe
cies upon, reports that come from only one party to
the battle. 'Â¦'Â¦Â¦ / . ,
In Great Britain itself it appears the- effect of the
blow has been staggering, but has not led to any
strengthening of the peace party, so far as present
reports indicate. Lord Rosebery, who has now as
sumed a large importance as a political leader after
his Jong retirement, has spoken for a vigorous prose
cution of the War. He is reported to have said: "It
will not dishearten .us. We have got to see this
thing through." The Tories of course will stand for
continuing the fight. It is their war and they can
not let 1 go. Sine/ therefore, the Liberals declare' in
favor ofia more vigorous prosecution of the contest,
it may be taken for granted that there is not much
prospect of peace; for a long time to come.,
The moral effect of the victory is sure to be im
mense. , For some time past it has been taken for
; granted that the s Boers have no chance of success
and that it is the duty of their leaders to make terms
to save a useless spilling of blood. Moved by that
belief public â¢ sentiment has been, to a -large extent
adverse. to the Boers. It has been felt that their
continuance of the fight was nothing more than sav
agery carrying on a hopeless battle out of a mere
feeling of revenge or a delight in fighting. In the
light of the victory of Delarey .that sentiment"will
pass away. When a Boer force can take the aggres
sive in an attack upon a British column under one
of the foremost" of British generals and utterly" de
stroy it, there clearly remains for them a good fight
ing chance for victory and. independence.
BY the blow delivered at General Methuen's
column the Boers have effectively refuted
the reports that they are no longer able to
carry on anything more than a guerrilla struggle un
worthy of the name of war. They have routed a
column of 1200 men on the march to join another
force of 1300, have captured its guns and its com
manding officers, and 'have accomplished all this not
in a remote recess of the mountains by ambush, but
by attacking the British when upon the march and
at a place very near to the scene of the first hos
tilities of the war. It is clear, then, that the Boers
are not only operating in bodies large enough to be
spoken of as armies, but that the field of their oper
ations has hardly been restricted by all the block
houses and forts the British have erected.
DELAREY'S VICTORY.
K. Sunisto, managing editor of. the Japanese
Times, is reported to. have said that since the an
nouncement of the treaty between Japan and Great
Britain "all talk of Russia seizing a port in Korea
has ceased. Japan is taking quiet possession of the
peninsula, and Russia is losing prestige with the
Koreans." That is the Japanese side of the story,
but to-morrow there may be a report from Russia
that will tell another story.
While this report leaves several counties of the
valley unaccounted for, it seems hardly likely that
they will remain aloof from the general movement
of their neighbors. There is not a county in that
district, nor in all California, for that matter, which
cannot afford to make a large and even a costly ex
hibit and derive a profit from; it. The St. Louis ex
position is to be the largest ever held. The amount
of money already provided for it assures that â¢ fact.
It is to come after a long series of years of prosper
ity throughout the world, and at a time when indus
trial and commercial competition are at the highest
intensity e\-er known. The progressive States of the
East hare already made provision for State exhibits.
The South will be there to show every inducement
she has to attract Northern migration. California
cannot afford in the face of such friendly but eager
rivalry to make a weak or partial presentation of her
industries and her resources. San Joaquin Valley
must do her share, and every county in it "should be
represented at its best' ; -:v'
In issuing the call the acting secretary states that
the idea of a distinctive exhibit has been indorsed by
the Valley Association, and a resolution adopted
providing for the appointment of a representative or
commissioner by the .Board of Supervisors and com
mercial organizations of each county in the valley,
but at the time of issuing the call he had been ad
vised of the appointment of representatives from but
two counties â San Joaquin and Fresno. The remain
ing six counties are urged to appoint their represen
tatives at once, so that they may.be present at the
meeting on Saturday. The secretary adds: "The
Supervisors of San Joaquin and Kern counties have
already voted funds for the exhibit. Fresno County
is certain to provide an exhibit. Tulare County will
almost surely take part."
Whether that plan of making an exhibit be the
best that can be devised must of course be left to the
determination of thoÂ«e who are familiar^ with all the
facts in the case and know best what sort of exhibit
will be most liberally and extensively supported by
those from whom it must draw contributions and
supplies. The Call has no advice to offer upon that
phase of the question. Upon the importance of some
form of exhibit, however, there can be no difference
of opinion. That issue is not one which concerns
San Joaquin Valley alone. The whole State will suf
fer if any considerable section of. the State is laggard
or illiberal in making a display of its resources.
In the call for the convention it is stated that there
will be submitted for consideration a resolution adopt
ed by the San Joaquin County Commission on the
St. Louis exposition declaring: "That the San Joaquin'
County Commission favors a San Joaquin Valley ex
hibit at the St. Louis exposition, each county that
so elects to have a distinctive exhibit, the valley ex
hibit preferably to form a part of the State exhibit;
that the mountain counties adjacent to ihc San Joa
quin Valley be invited to join with the counties of the
valley in making the exhibit."
SAN JOAQUIN AND THE PAIR
ON Saturday next a meeting ol representatives
of the counties of San Joaquin Valley will
be held at Fresno to decide . whether the
valley is lo have a distinctive exhibit at the St. Louis
exposition. As the time before the opening of the
exposition is now short, it is imperative that some
plan of action be agreed upon without delay, for a
great deal of work will have to be dqne in raising
money to defray expenses and in getting together a
comprehensive display of the industries and the re

In sending hjs brother to visit us the Kaiser ap
pears to have intended to convey to us in a most
signal manner a manifestation of his good will. If
it has not had the same effect that a royal visit
would have had upon a European nation it is bc
cauie we have not felt nny great need for royal
recognition. Our friendship for Germany goes out
to the German nation and the German people, from
whose ranks we have derived so numerous and so
desirable an immigration. Most of our people have
"thought or cared very little about the Kaiser's
friendship. Still, it is pleasing to know that we have
it. His brother has proved himself a genial, whole
souled gentleman. He has borne the tiresome func
tions of ovations and banquets with signal courtesy
and graced He has said the right things in the righ't
way, and if we do not feel so profoundly impressed
with the honor conferred by his visit as some Euro
pean nations might have done, we can still lay claim
to the keenest appreciation of the Kaiser's good will
and the genuine manly qualities of Prince Henry
himself.
In Europe such visits have a high diplomatic sig
nificance. ... When the Czar visited France, for ex
ample, or when the Kaiser visited Great Britain, it
was recognized everywhere that something of inter
national importance had taken place. Men and na
tions began to speculate as to what the visit meant
and what would be its effects. There can be no ques
tion but what the Empcfors who made the visits
felt that they were conferring signal marks of favor
upon the nations visited. When the Czar showed
himself the friend of France and the Kaiser showed
himself the friend of Great Britain it was felt
throughout Europe that the matter was of great mo
ment. In fact, the pomp and splendor of the re
ceptions were counted as but trifles in comparison
with the mighty meaning of the visit itself.
The mission is, we believe, the first, of the kind
ever undertaken by royalty with respect to this coun
try. From first to last the Prince has been. with us
not as a representative -of Germany, but of the
Kaiser. He has not been accredited by the
German Government. He has had no diplomatic
business to attend to. He came neither on matters
of war nor of commerce. His visit has been one of
royalty solely. It has not, however, been like the
casual visiting of royalty, as when the young Prince
of Wales came to us just before the war, or as the
"Grand Duke Alexis came later. In those instances
royalty was with us unofficially, as it were, but this
time it has come with all its dignities for. the express
purpose of manifesting imperial friendship.
That statement was of course drawn out by the re
port-from Berlin to the effect that the Prince would
endeavor to obtain,- the consent of. the United States
to the establishment of a German naval station in
some part of the American hemisphere. His words
put an end to the rumor. He has come to this
country solely to promote a feeling of good will and
friendliness on our part by manifesting the friendli
ness, of the Kaiser. < :

LETTER BY JOHN PAUL JONES.
SAN FRANCISCO, March 10, 1902.
Editor Callâ Dear Sir: In the Examiner of Saturday, March '
8, appeared an articleâ headed ''Could Fight, but Could Not*
Dance"â on the subject of Gunner Hill of the navy and his qual
ifications for commissioned rank.
Leaving out of the question the merits of Mr. Hill, which
are doubtless all that the Examiner describes in glowing, not to
say fulsome praise,. the article is worthy of notice for one reason
only, because of its historical untruthfulness. Much has been
made of this and' the Morgan-Sampson incident, which has been
exploited by the Hearst newspapers to defame a conscientious and
patriotic officer and heap abuse upon the navy, which the Ex
aminer and other papers of its stripe accuse of favoring aristoc
racy and being a close corporation, determined to freeze out true
merits
The Examlner Â» ln Its anxiety to make a case against the
"star-chamber war lords," has forgotten to mention that Gunners
Francis Martin and Henry B. Soule, neither of whom could dance
or play "ping-pong" (whatever that may be), were commissioned
ensigns from warrant officers July 30, 1901. and have been ad
mitted Into the inner circle of "carpet knights and pink teas."
Both of these deserving officers Dassed the required examination
before a board of Annapolis "aristocrats."
The officers of the navy can afford to Ignore these yelping
attacks â these falsehoods deliberately uttered by a newspaper
which knows betterâ for the integrity of the navy, almost the
entire fighting personnel of which is made from Annapolis grad
uatesâis beyond dispute, but the Examiner creature indulges in
such glaring and palpable Inaccuracies from an historical stand
point that I am tempted to renly. -~
The author of the Examiner's sarcastic defense of Gunner Hill
is singularly unhappy l n his comparisons when he Invokes the
spirit, of John, Paul Jones to champion his hero; neither Is ho
correct in his statement that Captain Chadwlck commanded the
Maine. Perhaps the Examiner meant the Rev. Father Chldwlck.
who was the Maine's chaplain. History Is taught at the naval
academy as well a 3 dancing â both are useful accomplishments to
gentlemen as well as naval officers. Paul Jones, as is well known,
notwithstanding his bumble origin, was essentially an aristocrat
by nature, if not. by birth. He was not only the founder of the
American navy and a master mariner, but a polished courtier of
the most aristocratic court of Europe, that of Louis XVI and
Marie Antoinette, a chevalier of France 'and vice admiral of an
empire, as well as a "fisher boy." the son of a poor gardener.
Herewith I venture to inclose a copy of a letter written by
himâ seventy years before the naval academy of whose aristocratic
doctrines the Examiner so bitterly complains was foundedâ to'
the Marine Committee of the First Continental Congress, second
session, in relation to the formation of a personnel for the pro
posed naval force with which the colonies hoped tÂ£ achieve their
Independence and upon which subject he was invited to express
his views. This, it must be remembered, was at a time when
good seamen and good gunners were more In demand than gentle
s men. Are we wrong now in being guided by the advice of this
peerless sailor while his matchless genius Is held up to us as an.
example for emulation?
As a graduate of Annapolis, who can dance, I may be classed
as one of the "gold-laced aristocracy," but may I not also claim
to be what the Examinees representative apparently is not?

era. These are the general qualifications, and the nearer the offl
cer approaches the full possession of them the more likely he will
be to serve his country well and win fame and honor for himself.
"Coming now to view the naval officer aboard ship and In re
lation to those under his command, he should be the soul of tact,
patience. Justice, firmness and charity. No meritorious act of a
subordinate should escape his attention or be left to pass without
Its' reward. If even the reward be only one word of approval. Con
versely, be should not be blind to a single fault in any, subordinate,
trough' at the. same time he should be quick and unfailing , to
distinguish error from malice, thoughtlessness from Incompetency,
and well-meant shortcoming from heedless or stupid blunder. As
he should be universal and Impartial In his rewards and approval
of merit, so should he be Judicial and unbending In his punishment
or reproof of misconduct.
"In his Intercourse with subordinates he should ever maintain
the attitude of the commander, but that need by no means prevent
him from the amenities of cordiality or the cultivation of good
cheer within proper limits. Every commanding officer should
hold with his subordinates such relations as will make them con
stantly anxious to receive invitation to sit at his mess table, and
his bearing toward them should be such as to encourage them to
express their opinions to him with freedom and to ask his vlewi
without reserve. Â«^ i .
"It Is always for the best Interest of the service that a cordi*!
interchange of senti ments and clvUitles should subsist between *
superior and subordinate officers aboard ship. Therefore it is tha^
worst' of policy in superiors to behave toward their subordinates^
with indiscriminate, hauteur, as if the latter were of a lower
species. Men of' liberal minds, themselves accustomed to com
mand, can nT bTOok thus being set at naught by others who. from
temporary authority, may claim a monopoly of pawer and sense
for the time being. If such men experience rude, ungentle treat "
ment from their superiors, it will create such heart-burnings and
resentments as are nowise consonant with that cheerful ardour And
ambitious spirit that ought ever to be characteristic of officers of
all grades In one word, every commander should keep constant
ly before him the great truth, that to be well obeyed he must be
perfectly esteemed.
"But it is not alone with subordinate officers that a commander
has to deal. Behind them, and the foundation of all. Is the crew.
To his men the commanding officer should be a Prophet. Priest
and King. His authority when off shore being necessarily abso
lute, the crew should be as one man > impressed that the Captain,
like the Sovereign, 'can do no wrong.'
"This is the most delicate of all the commanding officer**
obligations. No rule can be set for meeting it. It must ever be a
question of tact and perception of human nature on the
spot and to suit the occasion. If an officer falls in this, he can
not make up for such failure by Severity, austerity or cruelty.
Use force and apply restraint or punishment as he -may. he wtu
always have a sullen crew and an unhappy ship. But force
must be used sometimes for the ends of discipline. On such
occasions the quality of the commander will be most sorely tried.
You and the other members of the Honorable Committee will.
I am sure, pardon me for speaking with some feeling on this
pqlnt. It Is known to you and. I presume, to the other sea"*
men. your colleagues, that, only a few years ago, I was called
upon in a desperate emergency and as a last resort to preserve
the discipline requisite for the salvation of my ship and my
fever-stricken crew, to put to death with my own hands a re
fractory and wholly incorrigible sailor. I stood Jury trial for it
and was honorably acquitted. My acquittal was due- wholly to
the Impression made upon the minds of the Jury by the testi
mony of my crew. â¢ â¢ â¢ I do not reproach myself. But It
is a case to UluÂ»trate the truth of what I have already said,
namely, that the commander should always impress his crew with
the belief that whatever he doea or may have to do is right,
and that, like the Sovereign, he 'can do no wrong.'
"When a commander has. by tact, patience. Justice and f>m

Tin's has naturally proved intensely offensive to
prohibition nentiment, and the W. C. T. U. over in
New Jersey has appointed a day of prayer tp invoke
divine interposition to change the Biiliop'i heart!
This is a new form of the prayer test. Here is a
distinguished churchman, believed to stand in the
line of the apostolic succession, himself ordained in
use of ancient and approved rituals, to be bom
barded by invocations for his sins and shortcomings.
If he conclude to organize a defense he may clear
the ecclesiastical decks for action, pipe all hands to
quarters and deliver a broadside into the opposite
craft, Then the secular world will see which will
whip. When Everest Parny wrote his "Guerre des
Dicux" he never conceived any situation that was
fuller of suggestion or more calculated to spread
abroad the spirit of irreverence.
So Bishop Potter says reform the saloon, make it
a better club, make resort to it less likely to lead to
excesses, end proceeding on that line lift morals up
instead of throwing them down,
This view involves recognition of the - saloon
among the social forces. It involves denial of the
prohibition postulate that men can be, and must be,
made better by an act entitled an act. Refusing to rec
ognize in man a common human nature and an equal
ity of desires without an equality of ability to gratify
them, the Prohibitionists really, without meaning it
at all, propose to stratify society by legally denying
to the poor man the only humble means of gratifying
his social instincts. Grant that he often and sadly
abuses his opportunity, and would often be better if
it were withdrawn altogether, it still remains true
that efforts to suppress it by law have not succeeded,
but have usually made matters worse.
Bishop Potter, keenly observant of it all and aware
of the social conditions which make the saloon a sort
of poor man's club, has conceived the entirely ex
cusable idea that it will be wiser to make' that club
better instead of worse. In the evening, after his
day's work is done, the well-to-do citizen resc/rts to
his club. There he indulges with moderation in re
freshments, has that social intercourse which all hu
man beings crave, reads books or seeks recreation
in games, and, after a sort, rests himself from the
fatigues of the day's business. The man who works
for him has exactly the same social instincts, and, to
even a greater degree, desires and seeks means for
their gratification. Shall he mope and grow sullen at
home, or shall he seek the nearest substitute for his
employer's club. This he chooses to < do, and finds
it in the saloon. One- could well wish that he might
find a better, but it is not to be found, and so he
takes the best that is available. Bishop Potter has
recognized his needs, and has declared that there
should be means for satisfying them. He has in
sisted that instead of putting legal compulsion on
the saloon to be worse, there should tt* permitted to
it latitude in which to be better.
Bishop Potter has expressed the opinion that the
well-intended efforts of the Prohibitionists are a
failure. The war began over the Raines law in New
York City. By. that law saloons are compelled to as
sume the guise of hotels, to provide lodgings, food,
etc. In the long run it has worked out results in
imical to public morals. The hotel feature has
proved a refuge for abhorrent vices, and the moral
level of the city has been lowered below any plane
to which it has heretofore descended.
THE secular world never treats sacred things
with intended disrespect or irreverence. â¢ In
deed, it is. difficult to delimit the secular world
and describe it by metes and bounds, since there is in
all men a seated respect for things non-secular and
sacred. But just now those things of deeper mo
ment are in peril of ridicule, and not from anything
secular at all. -

THE Â£AN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1Â£, 1902.
Henry Watterson says the Democratic party must
get away from visionary theories, and now Mr.
Bryan will think Henry was talking about him.
Officials connected with the Board of
Public Works yesterday unearthed a sec
tion of the charter which will in all likeli
hood prevent the Market Street Railway
Company from carrying out its intention
to build an- 1 electric car line from the in
tersection of Kearny and California
streets, thence along California and across
Market and thence along Spear street to
Bryant. Notice to that effect was served
on the board named on Monday, but the
charter provision mentioned would indi
cate that the franchise once owned by the
corporation, at least. along Spear street,
has been forfeited from non-usage. Under
section 26 of the chapter on Miscellaneous
and the caption "Franchises Not in Use
Forfeited," the charter says:
All franchises and privileges heretofore
granted by the city and county,, which are not
in actual use or enjoyment, or which the
grantees thereof have not in good faith com
menced to exercise, are hereby declared for
feited and of no validity unless said grantees
or their assigns shall, within six months after
this charter takes effect, in good faith com
mence the exercise and enjoyment of such priv
ilege or franchise.
Under the terms of the section quoted
the time within' which the company was
required to begrln the exerclseof Its fran
chise on, Spear street expired Just twenty
months ago. The\Board of Works would
as a result be justified in preventing ope
rations on the street until a new franchise
should be granted. Under the charter the
franchise would be sold to the highest bid
der, who * would be' required to contribute
a certain percentage of the receipts to the
city.,';
The Board of Works . is of the opinion
that the franchise on. California street,
from Kearny to Market, has been con
served to the Market Street Company un
der a grant or leasa to -the California
street road, which is now using the road
way. However,' the whole subject mat
ter has 'been' referred to the City Attor
ney for legal advice with particular refer?
ence to the charter provision mentioned.

"Psycho" is the puzzle of tho moment
to many who are in doubt whether it be
man of flesh or dummy of wax.' "It" ar
rived only a short while ago from "old
London" on the Thames and has been
making a stir before Gothamltes and In
the capital city of Pennsylvania; It has
stirred the good people of New Orleans to
unwonted 'activity of wondering, and its
dexterous methods at the pedals arouse
sp great a gust of excitement that the
Windy City, alias Chicago, wished lo
claim "Psycho" for Its very own. But
P. H. Hill, a subject of his Britannic
Majesty King Edward VII, and manager
of the mystery, became desirous of visit
ing San Franci3co, and here he is with
his truly remarkable statue of guess
work, and it is safe to say that should
c i li St Wittman agree to the application
of Sherman, Clay & Co., there will be a
throng In and around the celebrated mu
sical house for weeks to come.
The figure is so perfect a representation
of the human man that were it not for the
mechanical movements the deception
would be absolutely complete. "It"
draws the stops of the "Angelus" and
e\en seems successful In getting- from the
instrument the various musical expres
sions and modulations.
Some of the things heard last night in
the surging, crushing, wondering throng
were: .

The cases of Frank Cushing, Thomas

petty ' larceny, "were dismissed- by Judge
Cabaniss yesterday. Cushing ia a porter
for Miller, Sloss & Co., and a few days
ago he carried several bags of nuts to
the sidewalk to be taken away -. by a cus

later discovered in. a >barn south of Mar

'evidence ' against them. The ! Judge said
there was absolutely no evidence against
Cushing and / he regretted ; that , he "had

such an offense.

CAPTAIN HOBNE TAKES
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The board of directors of the Chamber
of Commerce met yesterday afternoon to
discuss measures looking toward the
further advertisement and development
of the resources of California. A coursa
of procedure was decided upon, and if
everything goes smoothly the commercial
men of the whole State will unite a3 they
have never done before for the improve -
ment of existing conditions.
Action in the matter has resulted from
tho recent meeting Of the Sacramento
Valley Improvement Association in this
city. It was decided at that time that
something should be done to ! boom the
interior of the State, and the way in
which this should be done was left tu
the local commercial leaders.
A. B. Field introduced a resolution yes
terday favoring the movement and nam
ing President George A. Newhall a com
mittee of one to call a meeting of tha
presidents of all the other commercial
Dodies of the city to make definite ar
rangements for exploiting, the virtues
of tne Stato. The resolution was unan
imously adopted, and Mr. Newhall Â«ays
that the meeting will take place on
either Monday or Tuesday of next week.
It is planned that this meeting shall
call another meeting of representatives
of every commercial body in California.
The scheme is then to appoint commit
tees whose members will look after the
various details of the work. It Is ax
iomatic that the" organizations can ac
complish more by working together in
harmony than separately, and the com
mercial men are enthusiastic about the
results of the new movement Boards of
Trade and Chambers of Commerce in
various parts of the State have long been
trying to advertise and develop the re
sources of their respective sections, but
united action as now contemplated has
never been attempted. The I present plan
has met with general favor, and Â¦ the
greatest interest is everywhere mani
fested in its success. Those present yes
terday at the meeting were H. Rosenfefil,
E. R. Dlmond, A. B. Field, W. L. Gers
tle, R. P. Jennings, James Otis and
George A. Newhall.
The L. P. Fisher Advertising Agency
was elected to membership in the cham
ber. Jt~ was unanimously resolved to sec
ond the petition of the Stockton Cham
ber of Commerce to Congress to make an
appropriation for the building of a canal
to divert the course of various streams
which bring an obstructive sediment into
Stockton harbor.

Ah Sam's Lovemaking.
Ah Sam, a burly Chinese, was charged
In Judge Fritz's court yesterday | with
disturbing the peace. He lives on the
ground floor of a house at 10^ Trenton
place, and over him lives Mrs. Gertrude
Lee, a white woman who is married to a
Chinese. Ah Sam has been making love
to Mrs. Lee, and Monday night he kept
knocking On her window till she became
exasperated and tnrew a pitcher of wa
ter over him. Thin angered Ah Sam and
he raised a disturbance that resulted in
his arrest. He wanted to light the officer
who arrested him, and yesterday told the
Judge that he could thrash any policeman
in the city. The case was continued till
to-morrow.
I would not divert one single person from
settling in that charming region, I would not
speak a single word in disparagement of any
claims it has, and they are many, as a place
of residence; indeed I often wish I had the
happiness to be of their number. But I would
have the world know that California is greater
than a small part of it; that there are at
tractions and advantages and resources in
other I parts of the State of which the thou
sands who are looking this way as yet know
but little and know that little doubtlnxly.
Remarks were made by W. H. Mills,
Cralgle Sharp, J. S. Emery, C. M. Woos
ter, E. S. Maslin, B. N. Rowley, Mark L.
MacDonald of Santa Rosa, A. S. Liuce of
Santa Rosa, K. D. Sweetser of Sonoma
and Captain S. H. Day of Ixts Angeles.
Captain Day told about traveling
through the northern part of tho State.
He found therein soil and climate equal to
those possessed by Southern California,
Tho lack was of such people as have made
the south prosperous. "Once get them
into the north,", he sald.J'and they will be
the leaven to start things going.' 1
The board re-elected the old officers as
follows:
President, N, P. Chipman; vice president,
J, S. Emery; first vice president, Arthur R.
Brlggs; secretary and general manager, J. A.
Filche^.
Tho old board of directors was also re
elected.
North. Has Advantage.
The consideration of the new move
ment in this part of the State to promote
immigration and the report of President
Chipman of the showing made by the
State in a material way during the year
1901 engaged the greater part of nhe atten
tion of the board during the entire after-'
noon. Among the interesting statements
made by President Chipman was one rela
tive to the shipments of California pro
ducts out of the State in the year 1901.
The following table summarizes the facts
in that regard: .

President Chipman quoted, statistics and
reports of the Department of Agriculture
and called attention to the vast number
of olive and orange trees growing in the
northern counties to show that there is no
essential climatic Â¦ difference between
Northern and Southern California. Speak
ing of comparative statements, President
Chipman said: -

Sections Are Compared.
The board pledged itself by vote to this
programme without any uissantlng voice.
The California State Board of Trade
yesterday voted to direct its energies
especially' to the development of Northern
California and to offer co-operation hi
every way possible with the effort now
making for organized work to people this
vast and rich country. The matter was
brought up as a recommendation' before
the annual meeting of the board in the
annual address of President N. P. Chip
man. "A part of the report including the
recommendation was as follows:
I would tender to the leading spirits of the
new movement the entire working machinery
and exhibits of this board, together wltll tha
services of its officers, directors and employes.
If it is thought dsslrable by the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce I and the Saoramento
Valley and San Joaquln Valley Development
associations to make this board their executive
agent to promote the objects now being so
seriously considered I would Bay at .once enter
enthusiastically upon this, the most' Important
enterprise now confronting . Northern Cali

proval I suggest that it be at once com
municated to these bodies tor their considera
tion. ' \

NEW YORK, March 11.â Wall street senti
ment experienced a sense of relief when the
reports of the early London markets showed
that support was accorded the kafflr mar
ket there- and that very little damage
had resulted elsewhere from the shock of
the capture by the Boers of General Meth
uen. The price of British consols yielded only
a shade, which was probably the , most accu
rate index of the real gravity of the event in
Its Influence upon British financial affairs. The
revised report of the output of gold from the
Wltwatersrand for February is probably of
more real importance at this stage of the war,
and its showing may help to explain the indif
ference of the London market to the Methuen
disaster. According to this report. . by the
Transvaal Chamber of Mines, 81,405 ounces of
gold were taken out during February, com
pared with 70,340 in January; 53,897 in Decem
ber, and no more than : 39,095 in November.
This rate of the resumption of the gold output
means much to the foreign financial world, and
particularly to New York. The early strength
at London led to some covering by shorts in
this market, who put out some short lines
late yesterday In the hope of covering at a
profit on London selling this morning. There
was renewed movement in some of the minor
specialties, which have been the favorites for
some time past. The news of the deposit at
the Sub-Treasury of $1,250,000 in gold for tele
graphic transfer to San Francisco, in connec
tion with, the traction merger there, called re
newed attention to our own domestic money
situation. The selling movement which fol
lowed Was continued irregularly throughout the
day. The earlier gains were generally wiped
out by the first selling on this news, but there
were some subsequent recoveries and the mar
ket closed heavy in tone and without anima
tion. Without counting to-day's transfer to
Pan Francisco, the market's loss to the Sub-
Treasury since the last hank statement count-
Ing the Saturday's shipments of gold, fo'r which
payment was made to that institution, amounts
to $4,581,000. Foreign exchange rates, which
were easy yesterday, steadied to-day and the
question of additional gold exports is thereby
reopened. Of the day's special movements that
of Colorado & Southern stocks continued nota
ble. Manhattan was firm on the report of large
earnings. Unconfirmed rumors were still heard
of a consolidation of Mexican railroad interests.
Chicago Terminal stocks were advanced on re
ports of buying In the Interest of. Baltimore &
Ohio. The Wisconsin Central stocks were ac
tive and strong, without , specific explanation.
The strength In People's "Gas was due to re
ports of measures to contest the 75-cent cas
ordinance in Chicago. â¢ There were a few other
I wide movements of less importance and which
were not fully maintained. .
Bonds were rather dull and Irregular. Total
sales, par value, $2,985,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on the

some firmness and a fair business, with tha
demand, however, for "the lower grades. Prices
remain about the same. Jobbers are paying

BARLEY â The recent rains -have changed
the condition. of the market somewhat. There
is no longer any disposition . among holders to
hang back for higher prices, as a large crop is
in sight, and the tendency now Is to meet buy
ers. But the views of the latter, too, have
changed, and they are by no means as eager
to buy as they ' have been for several months
back. Offerings in this market are considerably
larger than of late, but sales are few. At the
came time the market is not very soft, for
there is still a good interior demand for ship
ment. The next steamer for Australia will
take out a large line of some hundreds of
tons, and Mexico and the Southwest are still
in the market for supplies. Futures, however,
are lower, as will be seen, and this indicates
an easier market ahead. .

Chicago was weak at a slight decline, and
there was more disposition to sell on rain in
Texas, extending northeast into the Mississippi
Valley. There was none In Kansas. The mar
ket soon lost its vim and relapsed into dull
ness. The coarse grains were active and the
tone was easy, with holders selling freely.
The cash demand for wheat was limited and
speculation was moderate. The Government
report, which appears in the first column, was
considered rather bullish, though it had little
effect. Prime, an authority, took exactly the
opposite view from that of Snow, published
yesterday and reported the winter crop iri
good condition as a rule. The Southwest and
commission houses dumped a good deal of
their wheat. Minneapolis reported a good cash
demand., with millers the chief buyers. Brad

CHICAGO, March 11.â Wheat fell bullish at
the start, having for its up-turn influences bet
ter cables, light receipts and the Government
report of yesterday. Wheat traders also had
an eye on corn, which -was expected to take a
big jump. When it was seen that corn bulls
received the news of the shortest corn reserve
on record with apathy wheat longs lost hope.
Then came recurrent advices of rain in Okla
homa and Texas, but the professionals forsook
the bull side, plenty of grain coming out. for
sale and the market turned bearish. The late
Liverpool cables were teasier and Paris was
down. The coarse grains also lost some of their
early show of strength and May wheat, which
ppened \ic uji to unchanged dt 77Â»4c to 77c,

1 he above percentage of wheat left in farm
ers' haad?. 23 per cent, is from 2 to 0 per cent
lower than was generally expected. The laEt
previous Government report suggested a crop
of Â«S0.OO0.0O0 bushels, 23 per cent of which
v-culd be 156.400.000 bushels. On the basis of
commercial estimates, however. 23 per cent
â¢ncuid be between 101,000,000 and 166,000,000
buihels.
The reports received make it manifest that
the 1901 wheat crop was one of the largest
Â«ver grown, that the corn crop was the small
est, with one exception, in twenty years, and
that the oat crop also was much below the
averope. Wheat as feed for animals has been
utid more extensively geographically, if not in
acwal volume, than ever before.
Cats in farmers' hands is about 30 per cent,
as compared with 3t5.2 per cent <292.800.O0v
bu:hc-lÂ£) of 1900 crop on hand March 1, 1901,
and 36.5 per cent (290.900,000) of 1839 crop on
hard March 1. 1U00.
Reports received from the Government's cor
rerpondents indicate that about 23 per cent of
la;t year's wheat crop is still in farmers'
hards, as compared with 24.5 per cent (12S,
100.000 bushels) of the crop of 1900 on hand

Butter Is on the verge of another decline, ac
cording: to the views of dealers. Receipts are
ample for all needs, and buyers, expecting them
to Increase steadily from now on, - are pur
chasing only from hand to mouth to fill im
mediate wants. During the recent stormy pe
riod the Humboldt farmers could not set their
milk to the creameries on account of the
swollen streams, but they can do so now, and
from this time on a marked increase in the
output up there is expected. Nearby sources
are also increasing their production, so there
will be plenty of Butter before long.
There is no further change in Cheese. The
market is dull.
Eggc are steadfer. The price has now got
down to a point where the public can buy the
goods freely, and the demand has materially
improved since the decline. Again, the clear
weather enables dealers to coldstore their sur
plus, which cleans a good many Eggs off the
floors, so the market is in better shape all
around. Dealers are buying freely in the coun

-The trial of Edward Fury, who was
employed as a special officer by the Rla
don Iron Works during the late strike,
on a charge of assault to murder for
shooting Peter Callahan, a striking ma
rine, fireman. In the face, was commenced
before a jury in Judge Dunne's court
yesterday. The prosecution closed its
case after â¢ examining the complaining
witness and P. N. HerMhy. C. Anderson.
H. Harris. J. Thornton. Alec Sturrock
and William H. Gately. The defense will
go on this morning.
Special Offider Fury on Trial,
A pleasing feature of the programme
was the introduction of a song by . a
young local composer, E. A. Bruguiere,
a quaint and clover effort, entitled "The
Gardener and tho Rose." The song was
encored, and '.Mrs. Fisk graciously re
peated it. There will" be three more con
certs on Thursday afternoon, Friday
evening and Saturday afternoon. ,
If Mrs. Katharine Fisk should leave
San Francisco with ideas the reverse of
complimentary of the San Francisco
audience, it could hardly surprise, after
the discourteous treatment to which she
was subjected last : night at Sherman &
day Hall, on her first appearance here.
The programme began nearer half past
than quarter past eight, but even then
there were many late comers, and the
singer was kept standing for some pain
ful'moments while these were being seat
ed. The management, that went so com
mendably far as to refuse admission dur
ing the numbers, will doubtless see to It
that Mrs. Fisk, and most of her audience,
are not annoyed again in like manner.
Mrs. Fisk has the happiness to be a
singer who can sing. She is one of the
most roundly gifted vocalists that have
been heard here, with every kind of com
petence for her art. With a deep, smooth,
rich and exquisitely-used voice, strong
dramatic temperament and large intelli
gence, the singer presents a programme
of amazing variety with an altogether ex
ceptional satisfaction to her audience.
She phrases beautifully and delightfully.
Her enunciation is a model of the art,
and she has styleâ lots of it. Perhaps
Mrs. Fisk was at her best in the three
arias from "Samson and Delilah," where
her dramatic tendencies are allowed full
play. But when tho charming interpreta
tions of the French ballads, "L'Esclare,"
"The Silver Ring," are remembered, then
it seems as if the singer were happiest
in these. The Schubert, "Der Tod " und
das Madchen," was also beautifully given
and the Hollaender "Winternacht." :
Josses of each contestant yesterday were:
Alpers <&. Bent 51, Eggers 54, Wilson S8,

there might have been more justice in it.
"It is ridiculous to call 'La Madeleine'
Immoral," said Miss "Walsh to-day. "Why,
there is no play upon the boards that
teache3 a greater lesson. It was - Mr.
Dam's object to write a play that should
show the struggles and sacrifices a
Â¦woman has to make to redeem herself
.from an evil life and obtain salvation. I
have been looking for years for just such
a play, with a character strongly drawn
and powerful and a theme that tells of
a grand - and noble j sacrifice â something
like that of Sidney Carton in Dickens'
'Tale of Two Cities.'. I have found that
play in 'La Madeleine.' The sentiment of
the play is* deeply moral and the lesson
taught is a good one. â¢ . ' Â¦

marked that It was "damned from start

to warrant his taking such action. Mayor
Collins sent a telegram, to Senator llanna
at Washington, asking that the National
Civic Federation, of whose executive com
mittee Hanna is chairman, should inter
est Itself in the matter and endeavor to
effect a settlement by arbitration. t
Â¦ The State Board of Arbitration to-day
had before it President Cox and the strike
committee of the Allied Freight Transpor
tation Council, but no way of settlement
could be agreed upon. This committee
also waited upon Mayor Collins, whero
the serious condition of affairs was dis
cussed, and he promised his best efforts
to effect an understanding between the
parties at issue. . â
A strong effort has been made to induce
the Boston Central Labor Union, which \a
composed of ninety affiliated trades of all
descriptions, to officially indorse the
strike by ordering out all its members,
and that body has the matter under con
sideration. The effect of such action
would be to paralyze business of all kinds.
The Central Labor Union has thus far
taken no part in the fight.
The members of the Teamsters' Union,
comprising 1400 brick, slag and cement
teamsters, also went out this afternoon,
which virtually ties up the building trades

v One of the moat important developments
of the day was the ordering out of the
longshoremen at the docks of the Phila

of those lines were compelled to depart
with only partial cargoes, while the
wharves are partially filled Â¦with freight

One thing is certainâ the protracted

bitter differences of opinion among the

"I am rather inclined to believe that no
decision has been arrived at, though one
rumor says the league will be proclaimed

Nothing was known In the House of
Commons up to 5:30 p. m. of the results
of the Cabinet meeting. John Redmond

place. John Dillon said: ; -

every effort to secure the extradition from
Canada, of Gaynor and Green, who are

sixty well trained juveniles of St. Dom
inic's congregation. They have been care
fully trained and rehearsed by Rev.
Father J. S. Jones, O. P., in that beauti
ful opera by Balfe, "The Bohemian
Girl," until it is remarkable how ex
quisitely they render, the music of the
great master. They make no mistakes,
there is no embarrassing * breaks or
pauses, and the little ones sing the beau
tiful music apparently without effort.
' The lovers of sweet music and the
patrons of the good old plantation melo
dies of the South have a great treat in
store for them on the night of April 1,
when the renowned Junior Choir - and
Choral Union of St. Dominic's Church
will give a performance at the Al
hambra' Theater, for the benefit of
the â¢ church. The benefit promises to
be an' unprecedented success, as the
gifted little singers with their sweet
voices' have already won an . envi
able reputation and there is; a great de
sire to hear them. They have. frequently
appeared in their own parish and have
surprised the people ofBenicia and Val
lejo with their precocious talent, but this
will be the first occasion on which they
have sung for the whole city. :

the husband's absence Papa Lees, with
h-awaid Crape, went to Naftaly'e place,
removed tbe furniture, and left the home
oesolate and wifeless.
The husband caused Lees' and Crape's
arrest. But his ca?c went to pieces in
court to-day when he admitted that his
wile had possession of the household
poods when they were removed, and that
likewise they were for the most part
community property. The accused father
in-law and his daughter, sniffing disdain
at her husband, left the courtroom in
high glee.

{ v.as the victim of a little by-play-but he
*.-aia best tell the story himself. "I must
confess that I have been the victim of an
Innocent deception, which turned out all
far the best, however.
"I had bcÂ«m resting under the belief, for
some years, that coffee eerved as a lubri-
cant to my cerebral convolutions, in other
words, 'made the wheels go round.* and I
had an idea that I could not work with-
out it as a stimulant.
*1 soon paid the penalty in nervousness,
loss of flesh, inÂ«omnia and restlessness,
none of which troubles would yield to
any or all medicines. I finally got in
\ rather a bad way and my wife took a
hand in the affair all unknown to me.
' She purchased a package of Postum Cof-
fee and first prav* me one-half Postum
and one-hÂ«ilf coffee. In a little time'she
had me down to clear Postum and I was
none the wiser.
"I noticed that I was getting better, my
nerve? were steadier, and I began to
flesh and sleep night?. My work
vras performed far better than in my old
condition.
"Commenting- upon ray greatly im-
prcx'ed health one morning. I was told
the truth. 'Tis to laugh.' so I fiubmltte.d
gracefully and joined the Postum rankfi.
"Expenenco leaches that boilingr is one-
* half the game. When the directions are
'â¢arried out the result will be aÂ« . fine a
cup 'of rich, fragTant coffee as ever de-
Ilffhted the *enees without rulnlny the
cerves."

finest rfinlfirttent nt MnHei-atf RAtVsOver in Alnmeda County there are signs
of further political complications. It is
whispered that Supervisor John Mitchell
of the Pardee forces -has resolved to en
ter the arena as a candidate for Assessor
against -Dalton.' The fact is broadly
recognized in Alameda County that Dr.
Paidee, in his aspirations for Guberna
torial honor, has a stanch following, but
It happens unfortunately for the chief
aspirant that his lieutenants are looking
out" for themselves. Frank Jordan, for
Instance, is a. brave supporter of Dr. Par
dee for Governor, but atthe same time
he is a - braver supporter of Frank Jordan
for clerk of the. Supreme Court.
Opposition to Dalton.
The clerkship to the Justices is not as
valuable a plum as it was a few
weeks ago. Under the charter the
clerk is entitled to five deputies, each at
a salary of $100 per month. Under the de
cision of -the Superior Court Judges that
Mayor Schmitz had no power to appoint
the clerk and that it devolved on the Jus
tices to select and the Supervisors to con
firm a candidate to that office, the matter
is' brought under the operation of the
State law. Under the State law the clerk
to the Justices can only appoint two depu
ties. >
Considerable wire-pulling was done yes
terday by various political parties In be
half of the numerous candidates for the
clerkship. It was generally recognized
that in the event of the Justices and the
Supervisors' committee agreeing on a
candidate the Board of Supervisors
would confirm the selection. If the Jus
tices and the committee are unable to
agree there is little chance of a clerk
being appointed. The board is composed
of seven Republicans, seven Democrats
and four Union Labor members, and there
is sure to be a deadlock if the Justices
send in the name of a candidate who is
not recommended by the special commit
tee of the Supervisors.
Powel Fredrick says that he and his
deputies will hojd on to their places until
the Supreme Court rules them out. They
propose to take an appeal from the recent
decision of the Superior Court Judges. As
to the question of salaries the clerk and
his deputies are prepared to do their work
and collect their emoluments in the event
of receiving a favorable decision from the
Supreme Court.

keeping more than two cows within cer
tain specified boundaries is a valid meas
ure. Lane quotes a Supreme Court deci
sion In support of his opinion that legis
lative authority extends to the suppres
sion or regulation of those things which
are hurtful to the general good. Lane
says that an ordinance to be general need
not cover the entire city, provided there
is good reason for the division of the city

charter which conflicts with such a dis
tricting of the city for sanitary pur
poses. ,

The grocery store and saloon kept by

entered early yesterday morning by burg

the front door with an Iron bar. They
broke open the till in the bar-room, after

Commission is improper. "When you ' say
it is Â¦discriminating against your client
you state what is not true."
"I say 'if you discriminate," retorted
Deuprey.
"Your language is not proper," replied
Newhall.
"Then I will withdraw it," said the at
torney.
"This case will go over one week in
order to give the Chief an opportunity to
investigate the case," said Newhall.
Deuprey again lost his temper, and as
he left the room he heatedly said, "Then
you'll hear from me later."
Mayor Schmitz was an Interested lis
tener to the proceedings, but said noth
ing. Â¦
"If you refuse to grant this license,"
he said, "it will be an unjust discrimina

President Newhall informed the attor
ney and his client that Market street was
a crowded thoroughfare and before
granting or denying the petition the mat
ter would be referred to Chief Wittman.
Deuprey became impatient with the com
mission and lost his temper.

war to the knife on Crimmins, but is

to *.ettle the fight for clerk of the Justices'

rear Providence. It was only natural he
should go there to put his savings away
â¢when he had decided not to trust all to
California. That he had in mind possible
reverses seems evident from the fact that
he placed the bulk of the deposits in his
wife's name. This would indicate his de
pire to have her placed beyond danger
in the event anything should occur to
him.
"You see," paid Attorney Reed to-night
after his arrival, '"none of us know for a
certainty why the doctor made that de

presumption that he was providing
against a rainy day or against possibility
of reverses in California.

brought to light from out-of-the-way
nooks and corners $3000 in gold coin and
at 'east J2OU0 worth of diamonds which
were found on a window sill. Thrown
carelessly into a corner of a closet was
uncovered a pair of gold mounted sus

property of the deceased dentist, a luxur

fairly gorgeous in its adornment of pre

But this is not all of the nest eggs that
the executor has uncovered since the
death of the aged dentist and his wife.

SACRAMENTO, March 11.â At the State
Controller's office it is stated that the
salary of $200 which for six months
Shortridge has drawn as Building ami
Loan Commissioner will not be paid to
McCabe in consequence of Judge Sea
well's decision. If McCabe wishes to ob
tain the $1200 he^ts short by reason of
payments to Shortridge he will have to
go to the Legislature, as was done in
the case of the late Denis Spencer, who
was appointed attorney for the State
Board of Health. George A. Knight re
fused to vacate the office and drew the
salary. A relief bill In the Legislature
afterward provided for the payment of
the Spencer claim.
The case of the people against Burbank has
not been overruled or even questioned by the
Supreme Court in any subsequent case. As
the term of a Building and Loan Commis
sioner does not begin at a fixed time and the
statute fails to specify the duration of the
term of one appointed to fill a vacancy. I
hold, upon the authority of that case, that
plaintiff's term of office is four years from the
time when his appointment took- effect.
In* the act of March 23, 1893. creating a
Board of Building and Loan Commissioners,
there is no provision limiting the duration of
the term of a commissioner appointed to fill
a vacancy caused by death or resignation:
neither is there any general statutory pro
vision that a person appointed to^-flll a va
cancy shall hold his office merely for the
remainder of the unexpired term of his pre
decessor. Such a provision is .expressly made
in case of a vacancy in the office of the Sec
retary of State, Controller, Treasurer, Attorney
General, State Harbor Commissioners and Di
rectors of the Insane Asylum.
McCabe was appointed Commissioner
by Governor Budd, vice W. A. Ryan, de
ceased, in December, 1898. In June. 1C01,
Governor Gage appointed C. M. Short
ridge Commissioner, vice McCabe, on the
ground that the latter as Ryan's suc
cessor was entitled to serve only the un
expired term. McCabe refused to give
up the office, claiming that his appoint
ment was good for four years, and he
performed the duties of' Commissioner
until Shortridge qualified on July 17. 1901.
Colgan issued a warrant to McCabe for
his salary up to that date, but refused to
recognize McCabe's claim that he was
still Commissioner.
The suit/ which was decided yesterday
was brought by McCabe in August, 1901.
Judge Seawell in his decision declared
that McCabe's term of office is four years
from the date of his appointment. He
cites the case of the People against Bur
bank, a suit similar in every way to the
one at issue, with the exception that Bur
bank was a District Judge. In that suit
it was held that a District Judge elected
to fill a vacancy caused by death or resig
nation was elected for the term of Bix
years. It was also held that the right of
a Judge elected to fill a vacancy, to hold
for a full term, was not affected by the
proclamation of the Governor calling the
election, that the office to be filled was
for an unexpired term, and that any act
of the Legislature attempting to limit the
duration of the term of the Judge, so
elected, to the unexpired term of his
predecessor, was unconstitutional. Judge
Seawell said:
The suit for a writ of mandate com
pelling State Controller E. P. Colgan to
issue a warrant to E. D. McCabe for
$93 35, claimed to be > due him for Â«salary
us Commissioner of Building and'' Loan
Associations, from July 17 to August 1,
1901, was decided by Judge Seawell yester
day in favor of the plaintiff, and a per
emptory writ was ordered issued.
Judge Seawell's decision ousts Charles
M. Shortridge from the Commlsaloner
bhip, as he holds that when Shortridge
was appointed by Governor Gage McCabe
held the place by virtue of an appoint
ment from Governor Budd. McCabe,
therefore, will serve as Commissioner un
til next December.
