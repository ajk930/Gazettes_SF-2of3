no_textTHEP^E is a story told of a pretty
girl who admired pretty shoes. But,
I alas, she wore number sevens 1
J^ Now, Ihis girl, being a young
woman of rauch good sense, de
cided that, no matter how large
the foot might be, if the shoes were well
shaped, nicely kept and in style, the
loot would look well.
Accordir.gly, the invested In a shoe
trunk, filled it with natty number sev
ens, and all ihe summer long she rowed,
tennised, golfed and b'ked in skirts to
her shoe :ops. The number sevens were
:nuch admired.
The shoe trunks are really only square
boxes, with little bags or compartments
of canvas, each one for holding a pair of
boots. You can get eight pairs in a well
developed box, and this Is about the
number the summer woman needs.
Now, eight pairs of shoes Eeem an
extravagant number; but you will find
that it is all right when you come to
study the subject. Shoes, which were the
Last to progress in a century of change,
have now fallen in step, literally, an J are
built and adjusted, trimmed and man
aged so that they match the rest of the
wardrobe.
l^ighi pairs of shoes, purchased out
risht, seem outrageous. But nowadays
you adJ to your shoes 'as you add to
your shirt waists in pairs; and they ac
cumulate, and you find you need them
alL Â¦
The economy, the convenience, not to
vpeak of the beauty and the comfort of
<>-.vnir.s many shoes, will appeal to you
so powerfully that once having eight or
more pairs to choose from you will never
be without them.
The Colonial Foot.
The colonial "slipper" must be in every
outfit. It comes in various weights and

Uiin sole and the Cuban heel. This slip

Then you will need colonial slippers In

: The "May sun' is shining on the sands
and the May sunlight is flitting across the
spring, shirt waists. It touches them
caressingly as though it liked them and
was glad of so dainty a resting place. ,
The number ! of new shirt waists, is so
great, and the kind so varied,, and the
tints so bewildering, that one is lost in
any attempt , to describe them. In buying
It is .well to count one's money and j to
place it upon the shirt waist that looks
the 'prettiest. Let the money go Just as
far as It will, for all shirt waists aro
cheap, considering. ;
Cheaper to , Buy.
' You can get more for your money In the
shirt waist market than in any other one
department.'- Thatis the general consen
sus | of I opinion, and , It is one to- which
most women - willr assent. If : you can \ do
better than buy your " shirt waists ready
made- then you are either a very clever
seamstress -. yourself j or ;â¢ have an "â¢ extra
clever one working, for you. , - ]
. One feature is particularly noticeable in
the new shirt waists." : They combine great
simplicity of outline with . great elabora
tion, of detail. ; ; .
The shape is plain, almost severe, but
L the goods may be inlaid with lace and the

half-high heels, wide toe, broad tongue
and black enamel buckle, with button

The sensation of the hour is the Du
Barry heel, which is three inches* high.
This is for a house and piazza shoe, but
it is worn In the street. For the street
leather is best; but for the house there
are satin shoes and shoes of thin un
glazed kid. The Du Barry is worked with
beads on the Instep and the tongue is
very tall and much beaded. But the fea
ture is the heel, which is three inches
high and more.
The woman' who gets up things herself,
inexpensively, can purchase a pair of
French-heeled shoes and have lifts added
to the heel- until they are very hiarh in
deed. Then she can bead. the toe and the
tongue. Thus she gets a Du Barry cheap.
The high boot Is a pretty thing. It Is
very tall and It la laced up the front. It
may be foxed with patent leather to give
it a finish. But the pretty part lies in a
tiny bow of black satin, which is fastened
on the instep with a buckle through the
bow. Imagine a high shoe with a buckle
and bow on the instep. And. Just fancy
calling it the perfectly correct â¢ thin* for
the street. .-Â¦-.-Â¦
The Pedestrian Shoe.
The pedestrian high shoe is a marvelous
thing, in aggressive proportions. v It â¢ is
wide and flat and It is stitched around the
vamp and across the tip and stitched
elaborately up each side of the lacing.
For the house the Louis XV heel, which
is a tall, French heel, will be worn on
ties, slippers and low . shoes . of all - de
scriptions, bÂ«t for the street the Cuban
heel leads, for it is the tail* straight, nat
ty, square heel, slightly curving in at the
back. It resembles the military heel.
The Oxford ties come in all materials
and are very neat; and one must have
white canvas Oxfords with white kid tips.
One can also be comfortable In black can
vas Oxfords with black kid tips. >ThÂ»
leather or kid tips hold the shoe in shape.
So, with the great array, of shoes from
which to choose, it is not to be wondered
at if the woman, of ambition and pretty
feet finds herself with a dozen, pairs and
longing for more v
There is this about a multiplicity of
shoes that they are no extravagance.
They will "keep" and one can go back, to
them. and wear them until they are worn
out. And, with the later day methods of
building Jow shoes with heavy soles, it is
possible to wear the low shoe all winter;
and this is what many a woman did and
will do. For the field sports a good low
shoe is best of all.
The New Stockings.
Summer stockings! Banish prudery,
away with quiet taste! Let the old fogy
wear her black cottons and the woman
behind the times rejoice in her plain llsles.
The woman who is up with the times
will have hosiery so fancy that she will
blush to behold It and all .the summer long
she will be lost in' bewilderment at her
own temerity in wearing: such gay leg
gear.
. Yet these stockings are > not bad form."
For the street, to wear with the colonial
slipper and its gun meta.1 Â¦ buckle, there
are gun metal stockings with stripes run
ning around the leg. i â¢ Between the gun
metal stripes there are black open work,
slip stitch bands. These stockings, while
not. of the hue of ebony, are not what is
known as loud, as they pass unnoticed in
a crowd. '.:.-.Â¦ -. v : . .. '. :'i ': Â¦ ',â¢Â¦'Â¦Â¦ \ ? ,
For those who simply- will not wear
stripes In the street- there are the beauti

nothing but ..their fineness and a mono

able in all the waists that one sees and
it explains the elegantly simple look
which even the most expensive waists
have. The straight outline is preserved.
\ More than usual efforts are heing made"
to preserve the buskâ not bustâ line. The
busk is the long,, straight line from' the
bust to the abdomen. It should be un
broken by a curve and it should be kept,

With the slender figure this is easy: In-'
deed, it is naturally straight, but whero
there is fullness of figure, look out for
the busk line. The straight. fronted cor

shapes that do this without discomfort.
One must study one's shape, however, to
get good results. ,..;*â¢ â¢.. : -
The girl who. used to paint plaques can
now turn her talent to her own personal
uses. Tli e effort which was made to in

cause of the fineness; of the lace that
was required and partly for lack of great
delicacy- of treatment. , .
The Painted "Waists.
But now they are painting silk lawns,
and the /blue silk lawn shirt waists are
gay with orchids which are painted, on
around the waist to look as though they
sprouted from the belt line. The stem3
are long. Blender things, crooked and
not very pronounced, but upon the yoke
and at the back of the neck orchids grow
tn wild profusion. â¢ , . â¢
â¢ To .' assert', that such a shirt waist is
not durable is to make no tax upon one's
credulity. | It is to be" worn one evening,
another ' evening . and a dance ; then

Mrs. Paderewski's Gowns.
Mrs. Paderewskl has^: as many nice
clothes as she will ,buy, for her adoring
husband sees in each new one a harmony.
She specially has shirt waists "Ameri
caine" of ,raany hues. She owns a very
fine assortment of vari-colored taffetas,
and for "zee style" one can look over her
wardrobe to educational advantage. She
wears her clothes weir and buy3 them on
this side, a thing that Americans would
not, do so badly to Imitate. Her favorite
color is green, on the acacia tone.
;Mrs. Herbert, daughter of Mrs. Wilson,
and one of the King's American favorites,
has been purchasing many handsome
gowns on this side of the Atlantic. Red
and purple and white are the only colors
to' be worn abroad. Miss Leiter'a ward-*
robe, which she takes over with her for
the coronation, has many gowns in these
hues. " . '
But the crowning stroke of national
pride, was put upon our native American
fashions by a French fashion journal.
This paper, long regarded as an inter
national dress authority, recently wrote to
a fashion writer of New York to send it
regularly two American columns per week
tilled with the latest American modes.
Specially does Europe look to this coun
try for its new color tones and for its
skirt outlines. So Paris comes to New
York for its novelties Just a3 It has al
ways gone to London for its tailor-mades.
A Summer Discovery.
A new washable shirt waist -has been
discovered by some Mrs. Columbus out
on a watery voyage! .
It has been learned that the ! all-laco
shirt waists, these in Irich crocheted and
in the liower patterns of heavy variety
will wash better after the lacy patterns
have been traced wtth narrow , satin rib
bons. â¢Â¦',
This is very good" to know, for the rib
bon makes the Â¦ lace tougher and more
durable, and if it can be easily laundered
so much the better. The waist is certain
ly made more elegant by this tracery of
ribbon. .."Â¦ â¢
-Strlng-colored ; lace makes up Into very
charming shirt waists, and now the latest
cry is to trim the, lace shirt waist with a
sailor collar of tan linen and with tan
linen cuffs.
Buttons of a light. amber color are used
on the waist, and there is a tall tan linen
stock with a little lace point sewed on thÂ«
front. The stocks are now "either pulled
dewn in front to. a long point or are cut
pointed, to secure . the long slender neck,
which has come into vogue with the Ion?
waist.' Â¦Â«..-'. :..
.There are a few articles of dress for
which only American women seem to
bows facing each other, opposite thÂ» *
opening. Long ends trail, of course, down
each side of the. front.
The Daffodil Hat.
Then there Is a hat of black crin
trimmed with daffodils and there are
black silk stockings with r. bunch of daf
fodils growing so high tLat you do not
suspect they are there.
Nothing remains to be supplied but the
skirt and the happy owner of this daffodil
set can pick and choose between a black
taffeta or a daffodil yellow face cloth.
Perhaps she will want to come out in a
white pongee, for the white pongee skirt
will be seen this summer.
The long coat, be It ping pong, auto,
Monte Carlo, coaching, colonial, empire or
Eugenie, will be worn and you can really
take your choice and still be in tha
style.
The Du Barry long coat must not be
forgotten. It blouses around the belt a::d
it is full in the skirts. It fastens all the
way down the front and quite covers
you up. It is pretty In satin for evening
and very fine in covert for rain.
There is a very pretty coat which must
not however, be worn by heavy figures.
It Is three-quarter length and comes
barely to the knees. It has a box plait

Shirt Waist Sleeves.
: The shirt waist sleeves show a full arm
gathered into a tight cuff, which ia only
a band of needlework after all, but there
are other and more elaborate sleeves worn
on shirt waists and of these' the mandolin
Is ore of the prettiest. -
The mandolin always shows the drapery
at the back, and clever modistes. In mat
pig wash shirt waists, are slitting triera
from the elbow to the cuff and nnishinjr
the edges with lace.
Then, underneath this shirt waist, there
Is worn a loose baggy undersleevo which
Is pulled out through the silt so that it
hangs long and low. This inside sleeve ij
independent of the outside and can fca
changed at will. Thus will talent triumph
over circumstances.
Have you heard of the latest fancy In
waists and are you "up" on what is to bo
the fad for. the summer?
This interesting departure ia no less
than the preparation of shirt waists for
the different months.
A pretty debutante who will grace the
Saratoga season has . white lawn shirt
waists, embroidered in pink roses for
June, and for August she will be bril
liant in red. geraniums. upon a gown of
blue mull. She owns golden rod fancies
for September and ever her busy fingers
are at work upon one more shirt waist.
This,youns woman, who ia a prize ex
hibitor at a very- gilt edged embroidery
show, rejoices In doing her own decorat
ing, and it is her taste to buy the plain
lawn or batiste -or linen or mull or challie
or fhesemi-decoraterl materials and em
broider them herself. She buys her v/aiots
ready made and tlnishes them with her
own -hands â not an impossible task by
any means and highly commendable from
a dressy point of view.
It is discouraging to think thit the shirt
waist season has only- just begun, far,
with the advent of July, there are sure to
be novelties and it looks as though Au
gust would keep bringing in new articles
to tempt the dollar from the flattening Â¦'""

shall have the French women, the Vien
nese and even the London women looking
to their footgear and studying delicate ef
fects. Now one notices too much* solÂ©
and too little daintiness in these matters.
The Pinky Hyacinths.
A shirt waist that was called a "dear"
was a pinky-red hyacinth color. - It was
trimmed with white insertion put on so
that It ran around the waist, under the
arms. .
The waist buttoned in the back and
through .the very open meshes of the in
sertion one caught a glimpse of a beauti
fully finished white lawn corset cover. It
self elaborately trimmed' with lace around
t*-e top.
The cover was all In one piece, one of
those affairs gathered around the belt
and around the neck, but not fitted.
Strips of lace Insertion go round the
cover, two inches apart, and they are
Iinea with lawn.
This kind of a corset cover Is really bet
ter with a blouse waist, for It blouses a
little and seems more in keeping than one
that nt3 snugly under the baggy outside.
It must be remembered that the corset
cover ia at all times visible under a shirt
waist of thin stuff.
A great novelty in dress has Just been
packed In a Newport trunk. It shows a
daffodil yellow shirt waist of silk lawn.
This is trimmed with lace put on In fes
toons around the yoke.
The sleeves are mandolin sleeves slit at
the back with lace or lawn pulled
through the opening, so as to fall In a
bag at the outside of the wrist.

The Summer Shoe and FashionsAt first I received some email compen
sation from McNulty and his friends for
the first appeal. In working over that I
was convinced of his Innocence. Then the
money gave out, but I kept at It at my
own expense. I took three separate bills
over three different matters and finally
took a writ of error to the Supreme
Court of the United States and went on
myself to Washington to. argue it.
In the meantime I had put into circu

ecutive clemency, interest having been
aroused in the case and thousands hav
ing come to the conclusion that the man
was Innocent, or . at most grullty of no
greater crime than manslaughter.;

In the same connection, and to show
how the crooks in the' country know a
criminal lawyer, there was the case of
two men arrested in San Francisco for
the stealing of a large amount of bonds
in one 'pf the Southern States., I had'no
connection with the case, but about four
or five days after their arrestâ long
enough for a telegram to reach the East
and for a man to come in response to Itâ
a man called at my house after, dark one
evening. He said he did not want to be
seen or known to be In the city, but that
he had been sent from the East to see
me, and knowing I was an attorney he
would place his confidence in me. He said
there were certain men under arrest
charged -with a bond robbery In the East
and he wanted me to see what I could do
to secure their release. He said they
were friends of his, that he was connect
ed â¢ with the robberyâ In , fact, had perpe
trated it.
One Instance of this was rather ludi
crous. During a celebration of the Native
Sons at Stockton, which I attended with
the parlor to which I belong, - we were
crowded around In the different hotels
there. One night I went to bed with the
boys as usual. and in the morning found
that some one had been In my room. My
trousers were gone and the door of my
room was ajar. Just outside tha door
lay the trousers, but the pockets were
empty. I Immediately dressed, and, tak
ing Borne of the other young men with me
went to police headquarters ant reported
the burglary of the room and my loss.
The Chief of Police asked me if I could
identify my pocketbook, and said he had
already had a report from the Postoffloa
Department of the finding of a pocket
book... /
i went I to the .postofflce, described the
pocketbook and the Postmaster handed It
to me. It appeared that the pocketbook
had been found by one of the letter car
riers In a mall box. Evidently the thief
on finding my card had made up his mind
I was too good a friend to rob.
While practicing law and defending so
many criminals I cams to have a reputa
tion among them as their friend.

This case presents a most remarkable
instance of what -a lawyer has to go
through sometimes in fighting a case.
There arose a question as to how certain
parts of the anatomy of this woman had
been injured. The prosecution claimed
it had been done by the use of flowers
found In the room. I claimed that Would
be impossible, that it could only have
been done by the hand and In a peculiar
manner. To establish this fact I Induced
the doctors who were testifying as ex
perts on behalf of the defense to take' me
to one of the medical schools with them
and try an experiment.
We went to the .medical college, and
from the vat In which subjects to be used
by students for operating purposes are

saved the life of Louis Matheney and he
walked out of court a free man.
Another Interesting case^-was that of
O'Neil, the man charged with killing Mrs.
Griffes, the wife of a newspaper reporter.
The woman was found in the Grizzly Bear
saloon on the water front in a lacerated
condition, horribly murdered. The case
was tried before Judge Wells, and I was
always satisfied in my mind that O'Neil
was not guilty of that crime. I am sat
isfied of it yet. The evidence was very
strong against him and he was in such
a beastly state of Intoxication on the
night of the occurrence that he could not
tell anything or lend any assistance In
his own defense as to where he was or
what he did. The case had to be fought
by breaking down the prosecution as far
as it could be done, and I succeeded to
the extent of securing at the hands of
the jury an acquittal of murder. He was
convicted ; of manslaughter - only.
I would go to the jail and hear the men
hammering away at the scaffold, and Mc-
Nulty would be standing in his cell with
a dead-white face and gTeat drops of
perspiration on his forehead.
But each time when I said.good-by ho
would say: "I haven't given up yet. I
know I will hear from you before to-mor
row." And next day the gallows would
come down and I would keep on working
The last time I went to see him and
heard the sound, we had both grown used
to McNulty said:
"If you don't get something donÂ© to
day I'm gone this time; but I won't go on
the fallows."
I said: "John, don't do anything to
yourself. I think we'll win it yet. At
any rate, when there is no further chance
I'll send some one that you can see In a
crowd, and when you see him you will
know there is no chance."
There was no occasion to send any one
On the morning before the day set for
the execution word came from the Gov
ernor that the sentence was commuted to
life imprisonment. â¢
I'm not through with the McNulty case
yet. Some day he must be pardoned He
Â¦was never guilty of anything but man
slaughter, and he has already served
more than a full term for that crime.
I defended Jane Shattuck, the mother
of Truly Shattuck, the actress, for kill
ing Harry Poole. At the first trial she
was convicted of murder in the first de
gree. The Supreme Court reversed the-
Judgment, and in the second trial I de-
fended her In connection with Mr. Len
non, making a plea of Insanity, and she
was acquitted.
One peculiarity of criminal cases Is that
when the people are behind bars they ex
press all sorts of gratitude for what you
do, and when they get out they forget all
about itâ they forget even to pay you.
Evidence the Shattuck case.
The case of . Matheney, charged with
killing a police officer while in perpetra
tion of burglary, was very remarkable In
this, that the case of the jjrosecuticfn was
wholly circumstantial evidence, which I
met in defense by a case of wholly cir
cumstantial evidence. The case was tried
in Oakland, and on the first trial the jury
stood eleven for conviction and one j for
acquittal; the second time he was ac
quitted. â¢
The case finally turned on the compari
son of diatoms, or fossil shellfish out of
existence for thousands of years and only
found in mud. They are -microscopic,
and cannot.be observed with the naked
eye at all. â¢
Matheney's claim was in alibi, that he
was hot in Oakland on the night of the
shooting, but was in Sausalito. , It was
the night of one of the greatest storms we
evei*" had here on the bay, and the mud
and dampness on his trousers were made
the turning point in the case.
He claimed to have been walking on
the beach at Sausalito, and on seeing a
rowboat adrift to have waded out from
shore to bring it In, thus accounting for
the mud and dampness.
The prosecution claimed he got the mud
in Oakland climbing- over roofs of build
ings and making his escape down the
street. ' ' .
The trousers w,ere brought into court,
and a bottle of distilled v/ater. The water
was poured into a basin and one leg of
the trousers dipped into it and wrung
out. The water was found to contain
salt, which proved that the trousers leg
had been wet with salt water, not rain
water.'. ....
From thÂ© other leg samples of mud
were taken and put under a microscope.
Samples of mud from Sausallto and from
the streets of Oakland were also put.un
der the glass; and as the prosecution- had
changed its theory and decided that the
man must have been in the mud on tha
beach on the Oakland side, samples were
taken all along. by the slaughter-house
and Brooklyn and diatoms from these
were put under tho "glass. Â¦ > ,.
Then Professor Hllgard . and' other sci
entists were called in, and the several
specimens were compared. There was
found in one * of the samples from the
trousers a diatom which the scientists
testified were very rare,, none, of them
having ever been found except on the
coast of South America. . This one was
particularly beautiful, and they all tes
tified that it was remarkably pare. In
the samples of Sausallto mud was found
a corresponding diatom, and no diatom
of that kind could be found In the Oak
land mud. . ThereforÂ© it can be Bald that
this Infinitesimal. thing called a diatom
IX twenty-six years at the bar and
six on the bench a man has enoueh
interesting experiences to fill a good
sized book.
My experience in court goes even
farther backâ back to the time when as a
boy I would beg my father, then in the
height of his fame as a criminal law
yer, to take me into court with him. I
well remember fitting in old Judge Dwin
elle's courtroom and listening to the trials
of Kpuval for the murder of Carrie Dia
mond by chloroform, Duane for 6hootlng
Roes and Laura D. Fair for shooting A. P.
Crittenden. It aroused ambitions in me
to be of the profession, which even then
I had learned to look upon as the goal of
life, and I wondered if I would ever bÂ©
able to plead as those I heard.
I commenced my practice in Buffalo, N.
Y.. with my father's brother. Josiah
Cook, now dead, but then enjoying a fine
practice there; but I liked California and
soon returned, entering the office of Delos
Lake as clerk. Receiving orders was a
novelty to me and it did not take me
long to find out that I could stand no
master but myself. I left his office and
hung out my shingle as a full-fledged at
torney and counselor at law. I have that
shins^e yet. stored away* in the attic, and.
will never forget the pride with which. I
read those gilt letters on the^sanded board
as 1 passed in and out of my office.
About the first case of anv importance
that I had was one in which I attacked
the validity of the dead Industrial School,
with the result that we came near turn
ing- out all the boys in the school.
Then there was the Oldhaxn case. In
which the man was charged with extort
ing money from the woman who had been
his wile. ThÂ« two had been divorced some
years before, but I claimed that inas
much as- the decree had never been re
corded, she was still his wife and as such
could not testify against him. When
court ' convened that afternoon the
woman's lawyer announced that the de
cree had been entered. I again objected
to her testifying on the ground that she
was his wife at the time he obtained the
money and that as they were one in the
eyes of the law he could not be guilty
of extortion. The Judge sustained me and
the case was dismissed.
In the four years spent in the Federal
courts I had a varied experience in prose
cuting stage robbers ana counterfeiters,
fighting Chinese who were trying to get
into the country and looking after cases
of beating on the high seas, where mas
ters and mates were accused of excessive
cruelty.
Resigning from that position Just before
my term expired, I was employed in the
defense of Abe Jones, the celebrated
stage robber. He was tried four different
times before Judge Hoffman. There were
something like fifteen or twenty stage
robberies charged against him, and con
viction meant life imprisonment. Three
times the Jury disagreed, and the fourth
time I managed to secure his acquittal of
all charges except two, which were mere
ly charges of larceny. He was undoubt
edly guilty; but In practicing law I never
allowed a client to tell me he was guilty.
The first thing I would cay was, "You
may or may not be guilty. I don't know
anything about it. You have employed
me to defend you, and if you want me to
defend you I can't do you Justice If I
know you are guilty, so don't tell me If
you are."
No, even if the man was guilty I never
would allow myself to believe It. I could
rot plead for him as earnestly if I be
lieved him guilty. Of course, in criminal
practice every man Is entitled to a lawyer
to defend him. It Is a lawyer's duty, and
his oath of office requires that he defend
a man to the best of his ability. No law
yer has a right to refuse any case on the
grounds of a personal opinion.
I had this brought home to me in the
case of Alex Goldenson, accused of killing
Mamie Kelly, a schoolgirl. He met her
after school and shot her, and the case
created great excitement. A mob was
formed and It almost came to taking him
out of Jail and hanging him.
When the trial came the counsel he had
chosen was engaged in some other court
and could not be present to try the case.
Judge Murphy refused to grant a continu
ance on that ground, and as I happened
to be in the courtroom he appointed mÂ©
to defend him. I declined. I did not want
to try the case. I did not think it possi
ble to defend him. The Judge said I must.
I prepared and presented an affidavit
stating I could not defend the case fairly
as I had read ail about it, had formed an
opinion as to the man's guilt, did not
think I could do the defendant Justice
and begged to be excused. The Judge,
said I could either try the case or go to
Jail for contempt.
There was nothing left but to try the
case, for I did not want to go to Jail, so
I requested that he appoint an attorney
to assist me. He appointed Alex Camp
bell. We went on to try the case, and
from start to finish the defendant never
spoke to us. He sat in court and would
not say a word ; nor would his family say
a word to us. They looked at It that they
had employed an attorney, that the Judge
was wrong in forcing the case to trial and
that no matter what happened they could
reverse the judgment.
We simply had to make the best defense
we could, and there was none to make
The prosecution proved that the man was
unquestionably guilty. We had nothing
to present. The jury convicted him. an 1
the case was taken to the Supreme Court
â¢where the Judgment was affirmed
Of thirty-three homicide cases I defend
ed during my practice at the bar Golden
eon was the only man I ever had hanged
and I never considered him my client!" '
a very celebrated case was that of John
McNulty, who had been tried before I
was brought into the case and was con
victed of murder in the first degree. He
was defended by J. N/ E. Wilson, and I
was brought into the case when It came
to the Supreme Court. The Supreme
Court affirmed the judgment from which
Wilson appealed, and then commenced
the fight I made on technicalities.
From Investigation of the case I was
tw f 11 ? 1 ? 3 "!, 1 '^aent occurred during
Â£fL trla^ Senders testified In his own
defense that he had bought the property
from Wootton and had taken the money
to the ranch in sacks of coin. To account
for not having been seen going to thÂ©
ranch he testified that he had gone
around by another road, left his buzjry at
thÂ© foot of thÂ© hill, and taken tha^acka
over thÂ© hill on foot to Wootton's ranch
To test the truthfulness of this I
thought it would be best for the Jury and
all handsr to visit the ranch and eo over
that trail. The Sheriff was wdfred to
hire a four-in-hand bus to carry the
party, and we went next day to tha
Wootton ranch.
On leaving thÂ© bus at tha foot of tha
mountain where Saunders testified ha left
his buggy and starting to climb over tha
nlll two of thÂ© Jurors came near death
from exhaustion without any sacks to
carry. Tha court ltself-myselfâ befora it
reached tha top of thÂ© hill with nothing
in Its hands was compelled to 11Â© flat on
its back to regain Its breath. It was thus
established that to carry a purseful of.
gold over that hill, much less tha money
Saunders claimed to have carried, was a
physical impossibility.
On the day of the visit to the ranch I
opened court In the morning at 8 o'clock.
The court being opened, tha Jury, dark,
stenographer, counsel on both sides, de
fendant and Judge all left the courtroom
and got into the bus, and whenever we
came to a place mentioned In tha testi
mony . tha bus was stopped, all hands
madÂ© a circle around thÂ© place, thÂ© re
porter opened his notÂ© book and tha wit
ness proceeded with tha testimony, after
which recess was again taken to retire to
the bus. Thus the court remained open
during that entire trip (it all being with
consent of counsel on both sides) and un
til we returned to the courtroom, which
wÂ© did not reach until 11:45 that night.
Tha entire session was from 8 a. m. to
11:45 p. m., including two meals taken in
open court, one on benches at tha ranch
from baskets we had taken, and one at a
country hotel la a small town passed
through on tha return trip at supper time.
During the entlra day thÂ© Jury did not
separata nor were thÂ© Jury, defendant or
court separated from onÂ© another.
So recent is the Botkln case that â¢very
body remembers It. and as it is yet to ba
tried again I hardly think It becoming to
say anything about thÂ© particulars of thÂ©
trial. *â¢-Â¦â¢Â«â¢â¢.
Tha" case of a man called Hoff, but
whose real nama is unspellable, was tried
twice before me. As a result of tha ver
dict In tlie first trial I sentenced him to
be hanged. In thÂ© second trial tha Jury
fixed tha punishment at Ufa Imprison
ment.
Tha second trial of that case, as well
as the cooling trial in tha Botkln case,
was occasioned by a decision of tha Su
preme Court wherein onÂ© of the instruc
tions given in the Durrant case, and
which 1 followed, was declared to ba er
roneous. In both of these cases a great
many points were made In the Supreme
Court on appeal, but my rulings warÂ©
affirmed on Â©very point raised except as
to this one instruction which in giving
I had copied verbatim from the thirrant
case, which had been affirmed by that
court less than a year before tha trial
of either case, the court holding that
that Instruction should not have been
given -even in the Durrant ease*, though
the case had been affirmed by them ana
tho prisoner executed. The Instruction
was onÂ© which had been given fifty years
before. In the - identical language by
Chief Justice Shaw In thÂ© celebrated
Dartmouth casÂ©, had been followed by
every court in tha Union for fifty years
and had been passed upon by our owi*
Supreme Court ' in two cases before tha
Durrant case. Finding It in the Durrant
case I felt Justified in adopting it; and
although the Supreme Court, in passing
on the appeals in the Hoff and . oucJn
cases, found all my own language In my
charges . correct, they decided that the
one paragraph put in quotations, the on*
taken from the Durrant case, was wrong,
and therefore 'the two cases had to bÂ©
tried over again. ; *'t*
?Â»P*i e 5. ase was trled three times, and thÂ©
third time I was asked to go to Fresno
and preside. The trial lasted three weeks
s?Â£Â« he was convicted, j sent hlm to
State prison for fourteen years, the long
est term for forgery, and no appeal was
ever taken on that trial.
Another Interesting case \ was that
pf Saunders, accused in Fresno County of
killing a rancher named Wootton: Saun
ders and Wootton had been seen together
t% n t.l^r 9 w on Â»,* ad Â£ ev<rr been seen af
terward, vvootton s body was never found,
t n * i o l hat rea son Saunders could not
be tried for murder. Under the law no
m , an / a P fl b *,, convlcted ot murder without
proof of finding of the body or some part
that could be Identified. No trace of tho
body ever having been found, a trial for
murder was Impossible; but as after
Wootton s disappearance deeds and notes
In favor of Saundera turned up he was
charged with the forgery of onÂ© of tho
deeds.
The largest feÂ© I ever received mu for
the prosecution of Worden an! other* in
the railroad strike cases in 1394. I got J10O
a day for five months. That was tha
largest because the case lasted ao Ion*:
but I have received as much as 13000 for
defending a casÂ© that required but two
days. '
On thÂ© bench I have had a good deal of
experience with criminals or all classes.
The first man . I sentenced to death was
one named Klose. At first I felt consid
erable anxiety over the proposition of
sentencing a man to bÂ© hanged, but whan
I came to realize that I was merely an In
strument of the law giving voice to tha
Legislature in passing nentenca, I realized
th . at ,S hero was no responsibility on my
shoulders, and from that time to this I
nave never felt any compunction save,
perhaps, in the recent case of the China
man who pleaded guilty to a charts of,
murder, when it was necessary for ma to
determine whether thÂ© sentencÂ© should ba
death or llfÂ© imprisonment, and I sen
tenced him to be hanged. Â¦_
In some cases where terms of Imprison
ment are to be Imposed it is hard to sen
tence a man to a long term; but the pain
It gives me in such cases Is more for the
families and relatives of thÂ© criminal than
for the criminal himself. In fact. I have
had cases where It was a most difficult
task to pronounce the sentence the law
compelled me to Impose not on account
of tHe guilty one, but those who suffered
more than he did. In the Durrant case
i,%? ?fV have U h i 9 task ' Â« * Â« a ' with
Judge Bahrs, and he pronounced thÂ© sen
tence. . â¢ â¢-â¢ J >
The wear and tear of such a life a* this
is something awful. A man can't stand it
alwaysâ the responsibility of men's free
dom, their very lives, depending on him,
I could not get away from ft day or
night, and I found that It was tearing me
to pieces. I had to give it up, and that
is how I happened to go on the bench. I
accepted the nomination offered me, was
elected and have been there ever since.
There Is ten times mors money to bÂ«
made In the practice of law than an the
bench, but very little of It comes from
criminal practice. Criminal* havÂ» no
money to pay lawyer's fees.
I undertook to see what could be dona
Â¦with the police. I had several' Interviews
with them, and alter each Interview he
would manage to reach my house and I
would communicate the result to him. At
last I told him I thought the only thing
to be done was to return the property, In
which event the prosecution might be
abandoned. He made another appoint
ment to meet me, and coming to my
house brought thÂ« stolen bonds â some
thing Ilka $10,000 worth, I think.
I surrendered the bonds to Chief Lee 3,
and the fellow went off without the police
or anybody else knowing he "was In town.
All they knew was that I handed them
the bonds, and as the robbery had been
committed In one of the Southern States
and I had been here all the time they
could not suspect that I had stolen them.
A similar case was when a pickpocket
robbed School Director Denman of a sold
watch, which he prized very highly, as
It had been presented to him by soma
pupils or teachers.
Before the trial was over I secured thÂ©
watch, and going one day to the office of
the Chief of Police, without any one see-
Ing me do It, I left the watch on the
counter. In the course of the trial I was
able to compel the police to say the watch
had been recoveredâ they could not tell
how; but as they had to admit they had
not received It from the defendant I
claimed the other fellow must have been
guilty of the crime. I hadn't got It from
the defendant, either, but from a friend
of his.
Being asked to do so, Judge Cook
has detailed some of the interesting
incidents that have come under his
notice in these years of practice in Ms
profession, giving many sidelights
on the character of criminals and the
methods resorted to in their defense.
Perhaps no man in California has
had a wider experience in the han
dling of criminal cases than Judga
Carroll Cook of the Superior Court,
who for a quarter of a century de
voted his attention to criminal prac
tice and who, since going on the
bench six years ago, has presided
over some of the most notable crim
inal cases in the history of the coun
try.
To a criminal lawyer no other
phase of the law presents so much of
interest as the defense of the man
who has outraged the basic principles
cf society. It is the tense human iii
ierest, and the feeling of an inevit
able fight against heavy odds that
makes it worth while.
Nevertheless, it happens that the
bulk of criminal cases is divided
among a very few lawyers â whether
by common consent or the choice, of
the few is hard to say.
x urther, it is a lawyer's sworn duty
to defend any man who seeks his ser
vices regardless of his own prejudices
in the matter.
Â«-> <? 0 criminal is so mean and so
irM surely guilty as to be denied
ii ii the right of trial, and in the
cause of justice the law provides that
he shall have a lawyer to defend him,
whether lie can pay for one or not.

A and B make a gain of nine tricks.
Trick 1. This is the common-sense
opening from the hand. As there Is not
hope of more 'than one trick in clubs, and
the four-card : diamond suit Is so weak
the trumps are out of the question, so A
"runs" with his ace of clubs and gets It
in out of the wet. i
Trick 2. A has . four trumps, and does
not wish to give Z a ruff if B has the
king" of dubs, but as his best suit Is not
established, he cannot lead trumps when
void of spades, so he, tries the diamonds.
A and B find a cross ruff already develop
ed, which they play for all it is worth,
while Z glgnajs vainly for trumps.-
ON this important question, What
shall be played with ace and four
others? It Is truly a difficult
question to answer. Believing that
an inflexible rule should not be
adopted In this case, except, possibly, by
beginners, I will quote some rules which
are somewhat dependent upon Individ
ual adaptability.
From a hand consisting of ace and
four small in one plain suit, a single
card in a second plain suit and no honor
in the third plain suit, even if you hold
four trumps with one honor, lead the
ace. â¢
The fact that five cards are held In
one suit and a singleton in another
naturally would imply an unequal dis
tribution of suits will be held by the
other players at the table; with every
chance that your partner may be short
in your five-card suit, a cross ruff is
one of the probabilities. That your part
ner's five-card suit would more than
likely be the one In which you hold the
singleton seems to present the greatest
possibilities.
From a similar hand, with a high honor
In a third suit (a possible re-entry) and
four trumps with two honors, the value
of the cards with the ace gives oppor
tunity tor the exercise of individual judg
ment as to the advantage most likely to
be gained by an attempt to bring In the
long suit In place of playing for the
cross ruff. If, instead of a singleton,
two cards are held In the second suit,
fourth best is beyond doubt the proper
lead.
From a hand containing ace and four
others In one plain suit, the remainder
of the hand being fairly evenly divided,
with some strength in each suit, lead
the fourth best.
If, with the ace, queen, ten and two
others, or the queen and any three be
low the ten are held, the lead depends
upon the balance of the hand.
If you hold good trump strength and
a re-entry, lead fourth best. If hold
ing no strength in the other plain suits,
even if four trumps are held, lead the
ace. -
The greater the all-round trick-taking
possibilities of the hand, the more ap
parent becomes the advisability of the
lead of the fourth best.
Some claim that the weaker the hand
the greater the reason for leading fourth
best as a protection to your partner by
the refusal to at once give up the com
mand of that suit. . - '
On the other hand, there is the possi
bility that partner, in case he wins
the trick, may lead trumps from- medium
strength In an effort to bring in the suit,
and loss result thereby.
If partner has shown strength In
trumps, a lead of the fourth best from
ace and four or five others In an effort
to put him in_f or a continuation of the

be i managed like trumps and leads made
which would not be safe ' under other

This deal Is a remarkable whist curi

when it comes up, they don't cut it none

they ain't capable of sech wisdom. They

that when the sheep get well the corigre

reproachful talk an' a fresh coat of paint,
an* put him back on his perch. The
saint'll come winner on the deal, all right,
the padre says.
" 'Besides,' argues the padre. It is on

come pawin' about to protect a saint.
These yere Images,' he insists, 'can look
after themse'fs an' oring affairs to a
focus. They finds the way outen thelf

"At that j we proceeds f or'ard to the

the padre explains to me how, nacherally.

" 1 studies for the church In Baltimore,*
the padre says, 'an' thar the priest must
keep a curb on his Americano parish

They're fierce an* headlong an' go too far.
If you let them gamble, they gamble too
much; if you let them drink, they drink
too much. The eviltof the Americano Is
that he overplays. It Is not so with the

only a trifle an' for pleasure; If he drinks,
U Is but enough to free a bird's sons la

an' gamble, but it's only play; It Is never

one Is too bad or too good or too rich or
too poor or too unhappy.*

shore disposes of the question; an* since
I've just been drinkln* his Valley Tan. I
don't enter no protests to what he states.
Moreover, I ain't none certain he don't
call the turn a whole lot.

derin' along in his company, he informs
me that followin' the services thar'U be
a fight between his j chicken an' a rival

"Son, you should have witnessed that
battle! It's lively, carnage; yes; the pad

"On the hocks of the padre's triumph,
one of his parishioners gets excited,
shakes a chicken outen a bag an* pro
claims that he'll fight him ag'in the world

enthoosiast gives notice that if the first
parishioner will pinch down-, his bluff to
one dollarâ he says he don't believe in
losin' an' winnln' fortunes on a chickenâ
he'll prodoose a bird an' go him once.

they're prayin' that their partic'lar chlck

about as many Greasers is throwln* them

figgers them orisons is a stand-off.
"As the birds goes to the center, one
party sprinkles something on his chicken.
At that the opp'sltion grabs up his bird
an* appeals to the padre. He challenges
the other's bird because he says he's been
sprinkled with holy-water. \
"The padre enquires, an' the holy'water
sharp confesses his guilt. Also, he admits
that he hides the gaffs onder the altar
cloth doorin* the recent church services,
so they'll acquire extra grace an* power.
"The padre waxes plumb severe at this,
an* declar*s the fight off, ah' forfeits the
doctored chicken an' the gaffs to him
se'f a whole lotâ he's representln' the
church â to teach the holy-water sharp
that yereafter he's not to go seizin* onfair
advantages, an' to lead a happier an' a
better life. That culprit don't say a word;
he simply passes over his chicken an' the
steel- regalia for its heels; you can bet
that padre's word is law In the Plaza.
Chaparita!
"FollowinV this yere fiasco of the holy

The padre su'gests that we go a-weavin*

home camp of mirth an' hilarity, that

It's needless to observe that I accom
panies the beady-eyed padre without a

limitation, that said Valley Tan merits
)he padre's encomiums an' fixes me in my
fav'rite theory that no matter what hap
pens, only the best happens to the church.
"As we crosses the little plaza on our

Longest and Most Costly Tun
nel in the World.
THE railway tunnel under the Simp

Italy is the biggest thing of Its kind
yet attempted. A quarter of a cen
tury ago such a project would have been
quite infeasible. It differs from the Mount
Cenis, Mount St. Gothard and Ariberg.

In being a continuous rock tunnel, uncon
nected with the outer air by a .single ver
tical shaft.
Its length will be 19,731 metersâ mora
than twelve milesâ as against 15,000 me
ters for the Gothard, 12,800 for the Cenis.
and 10,300 for the Ariberg. On the other
hand. It will be only 6S7 metersâ less than
2300 feet â above sea level, whereas the
altitudes of the others range from 33CO to
4600 feet. The low elevation avoids the
steep grades of the other lines and se
cures for the approaches comparative Im
munity from snow blockades and ava
lanches. â¢
At some points the tunnel will be more
than a mile below the surface of the
mountain. This fact at oneÂ© suggests onÂ»
of the difficulties of the work. The tern-,
perature of borings in level countries rises
a degree for each flf ty-flve feet of da
scent. In mountain borings the Increase

mates predict a temperature of 104 da-.
grees Fahrenheit for. the deepest, part of
the tunnel.
In the central part of the Gothard tun
nel, where the temperature was only 83
degrees, the men could work only five
hours a day and had every third day off.
In the Simplon workings the tempera

Vinon is for email shoulders, and all nte
successors in French literature, writing
of the squarest women in the world, write
in praise of sloping shoulders.
The present fashion -in. shoulders is a
return to the Sir Joshua Reynolds type,
which never varied from the long, grad
uai slope, > It was- the- patrician line ot
the day, and a ; !ady \was bound to have
it. The^ Reynolds shoulder, had a deeper
slope, however,' than - that of the twen
tieth century' beile, but no more beauti
ful or .artistic curves'. "*
The wily . beauty who owns a 'perfect
pair of* shoulders and knows it to be one
of her strong points, discreetly makes
the most of it, and if she turns her back
ou you you. can. easily forgive her, n<>
matter 'how lovely her face. Shoulders

eternal youth that escapes the . lips'and
the eyes. Even after time lias lined the
face and throat, shoulders retain 'their
girlish freshness, smoothness and fair
ness. ' Â¦ -. ' â¢ 'â¢Â¦.' . - ':â¢ â¢ J
They need care and attention, of "â¢course,
and often it is left to the owner to de
velop the shoulders'â to . make them 4>eau^
tiful, firm and self-reliant. Â¦ 'Â¦',
To be confronted with outstanding
shoulder blades 'is a hard fate. But once
a woman concedes the point, and con
fosses to herself that she is in danger of
having small, angular and featherless
1 win^s, and that she would rather be a
woman than an' -angel, there Is little or
nothing in the way of flattening that
.may not be accomplished, and in a few
Weeks' time, with the aid of a' little pa
tient intelligence, she may give herself
the shoulders of perfect womanhood.
The trouble all lies* with. three muscles,
and that they are troublesome may be
judged from their namesâ trapezius and
rhomboidei. The former is one large mus
cJe which begins .at the base of the skull
and continues down the spine for some
way, branching out en route to the shoul
der blades; the rhomboidei are the two
muscles between. One very good exer
cise -for bringing them into subjugation,
if they are refractory, is to move the
arms in a circle from the shoulders until
the shoulders are so supple that the
backs of the hands can be placed to
gether behind the wrists without curvo
of the arms. The circling, of the arm
from the shoulder inward, not outward,
is. another aid for acquiring a graceful^
contour. Â¦ â¢ Â¦Â¦â¢ Â¦' - . r â¢
Another helpful exercise is to lie face
downward, place the . hands, under the
shoulders, and raise the body upon \ the
knees until the arms are straight. For
the second movement raise the body up
until the toes and hands l are the only
points-of support. .
While -lying face downward, if the' aid
of a friend can be invoked, massage
should be, applied. The muscles on each
side -of the. spine are taken between
thumb and fingers and rolled; then with
the palms of the hands the â¢ rhomboidal
muscles are kneaded, by using the rotary

Broad and square are the shoulders of

it is or.ly once in a while that a woman
possesses a shoulder which is exactly
modeled, exquisite in nneness and full of
expression.
American girls are credited with pos
sessing mo\ artistic shoulders than their
LZnglish or French cousins, and also more
perfect arms, the one often being the ac
companiment of the other. In England
a girl is taught to hold her shoulder^
back, throw her chest out, and to take
iong strides in walking. A squareness
of the shoulders results from this train
ing that develors angularity later on.
Epaules de porte-manteau are the re
proach of the French woman, a porte
ir.anteau being the Fre/ich name of the
little, high-shouldered contrivance which
is used in a wardrobe to hang a cloak
or a jacket on. The French girl, how
ever, knows how to use her shoulders
to advantage; she speaks with them as
some women with their eyes, emphasiz
ing her words by expressive little slirugs.
V.'hen she says something particularly
droll, her supple shoulders help to con
vey the meanine.
The fashion in shoulders is constantly
charging. In classic times tttey were
broad and strong. One has but to study
the Venus de Milo to behold the model
of ideal shoulders. The absence o^arms
r>nd the peculiar twist of the neck bring
into stronger prominence than they. would
otherwise have enjoyed the shoulders.
particular Instance has passed the experi
mental stage and as two machines havn
been In operation for some time in tha
office of thÂ« superintendent of telegraph
of the Long Island Railroad Company In
tha station in Long Island City tho in
ventor has reasons for hoping that his
system may revolutionize all existing
methods of telegraphic 'communication by
land wires, because of Its quickness, sim
plicity and cheapness. He says that his
invention can be operated over any dis
tance; that any number of Intermediate
stations can be Included; that It will
transmit messages at a speed beyond the
skill of the most rapid operator: that the
correct transmission of messages is in
sured absolutely; that It will supplant the
stock ticker, and that It may be placed
On circuits in conjunction with the tele
phone for private use.
In operation the operator strikes a key
and sends a combination of electrical Im
pulses through the contact points and the
distributor. The proper bar receives
through Its magnet the impulses and
prints the letter, numeral or sign Indi
cated on the key. At the same time the
Impulses go over a line wire and repeat
the operation on a similar machine. For
instance, the combination for the letter
key for A sends one Impulse, then two
A may be 121. The pressing down ef the
key for A sends one Impulse, then two
impulses and then one impulse. The elec
trical apparatus picks them up and diJ
tributes, them to the magnet of the type
bar of A. The bar moves to Its place of
printing and the impression on paper fol
lows. After the impression the motor
moves the roller carriage along and the
machine is ready for the sending of xnor*
impulses. The rapidity of the operation
is equal to that of ordinary typewriting
and superior to that of the system of tele
graphing fn common use. The impulses
can hardly be distinguished, one from th*
other. Each combination goes through
during the downward movement of each
key or the space bar.
Of course, the machine at the receiving
end of the line must have its electrical
apparatus arranged for combinations sim
ilar to those of the sending machine. The
impulses go through properly except dur
ing line disturbances, as in ordinary teleg
raphy. By the use of the first four nura-.
erals the combinations can be almost un
limited: In private use the sending and
receiving machines can employ selected
and secret combinations. On circuits for
business messages and press news re
ports the several machines can employ
general combinations. The combinations
can be changed at any time, so that the
.leakage of information by wire tapping
can be avoided. The current necessary
for operation is the same as that for or
dinary telegraphing. By means of a sim
ple switch the line can be used for the
Morse system, the telephone or the typo
telegraph. The typo-telegraph, it has
been claimed, can be operated over any
telephone circuit, and a message can be
printed in the absence of a subscriber.
The Inventor maintains that the typo
telegraph may be arranged so that a mul
tiplex system can transmit six messages
simultaneously over one wireâ three in
opposite directionsâ allowing 240 words a
minute for two Operators. Under such a
system the message would be recorded on
a tar>e. â¢ . Â¦ Â¦

times during each minute, and It Is esti
mated that with each respiration a ""i
will inhale about one pint of air. There
are 1440 minutes in a day's time, or twen
ty-four hours. Assuming that a man will
breathe twenty times every minute, we
find that in twenty-four hours he will
have breathed 28.S0O times. In a month's
time, or thirty days, the man will have
breathed 86,400 times. Allowing 363 days
for a year, we find that he will breathe
10,512,C0O times In from January to Janu
ary. Take thirty-five years as the aver
age ler.srUi of a man's life and we will
find that* a man will breathe 367,920,000
times. If he lives to be 50 years old he
will breathe 525,C00,CC0 times, and if he
touches the ripe old age of 100, which
often happens, he will have breathed
1,031,200,000 times. Now how much air will
he breathe in that time? One -Dint for
every respiration. Roughly speaking. It
has been estimated that under normal
conditions an adult will breathe about
10,000 quarts of air every twenty-four
hours, or about 2500 gallons. Thl3 is about
300,000 quarts every thirty days, and about
3.630.0C0 every year. If a man lives to
reach the average adopted, 35 years, he*
will have breathed during that time abotjj^
127,730,000 quarts of air, or about 31.<i32.500
gallons, which is several barrels when you
come to think of it. Of course, I have
made no allowance for many conditions
which 'necessarily enter Into one's breath
ing,, and hence my results are merely ap
proximations. There is. for instance, the
difference between the breathing of the
adult and the child. While a grown per
son will breathe nineteen or twenty times
every minute a child will breathe any
where from twenty-five to thirty-five
times.

And It Is not alone that there Is laugh
ter in his plays; there Is philosophy as

1e this very element that has made his
creations so 'popular. Witness these few
lines selected at random from "Reilly and
the 400" as evidence:
"The Italian Junkman." "Mordecal

"Dear Old Larry."
Out of all of which he has acquired not
only fame, but a fortune as well, which
he will risk to the last dollar on a big re
vival of his own plays as soon as he fin
ishes his engagement at the Grand Opera
house and returns to New York.
It was there, too. that he learned the
value of hard work and Eteady, consist
ent effort. Just read this partial list of
his plays. They have convulsed three
generations with laughter, and It was the
work of a lifetime to have written them
alone, much less to have acted them all
as no one else could possibly have done:
It was there that he learned the In

characters as his "P^eilly of the 490,"
Waddy Googan. Mulligan of the Guards,
the O'Reagans and all the rest of his real
lift- wits, that have become almost Im

Harrlsan is the most famous author
actor in the world. He lias been on the
ttage for more than thirty-five years, and
in that time he has written more than
twenty-five comedies and played the lead
ing roles himself. Before that time he
was a shipwright on the water front of
San Francisco, laboring hard from the
time he was a little over thirteen years
old until he was eighteen, driving oakum
and tar between the cracks of the plann
ing of great wooden hulks.

,The ordinary routine of fame on tho
stage, however, is almost as long as Sher

of Ferris Hartman.
In t late '80's he occupied the humble
positi^ti of property boy with the Chicago
Church Choir Company, the four "C's"
of which were the most familiar orna
ments of the comic opera billboards of
those days. Young . F.errls watched tha
merry comedians njsfct after night with
an ever growing anrbition to become onÂ©

tortions, and clung to the thought, "Oh,
if I could only get a chance," until ono
night the occasion arose.
Joe Herbert was playing Mustapha ia
"Fatinitza," and having been taken sick,
the management cast about for a substi
tute. The property boy had no frland at
court to plead his cause, so he boldly of
fered his services, telling them that hÂ»
knew the part and was confident that bÂ»
could get through without any serious,

"Here is my opportunity," thought thÂ«
coming comedian, "and I'll fir* 'em all

And he conscientiously carried out his
programme. He Introduced business that
was never heard of in thÂ» part, did cart

three years ago they decided to learn
gymnastics and "do a German turn" on
the horizontal bars. They became ex
ceptionally clever in a very short time,
and then as an introduction to their spe
cialty they invented a German cake walk.
They never got beyond the cake walk in
their acrobatic act. It alone made their
fame, and in a single performance they
became almost as great as Weber and
Fields for their German comicalities. And
for the last three years they have been
acting up to their reputation without a
single- week's vacation. If you don't
think it is hard work just watch them
through a single performance.

I whose lines are rehearsed from

âthis is the play that we have been see-

Imagine a whole play being rehearsed

Imagine, instead of a stage-full of act

never misses it. He is on time, and he

1ALKING about dogs, how would
Vou lifce to pay $400 a pound for fifty
pounds of dog?
JCo? Of course not. But that is
because you never stopped to
figure the dividends of this particular
twenty-thousand dollar dogâ Billy, the
flog that does a statue act on the Or
pheum stage at a salary that many a col
leg-e graduate might envy him, the dog
that carries a ten-thousand dollar life in
surance policy, the dog that Is the only
Dne of his kind in the world.
Of course there axe other pure white

for a whole minute of sixty long seconds,
while people across the footlights are
splitting their gloves and .' making more
noise than a big kennelful of his fellows
could do in a free-for-all fight.
Billy belongs to Miss Chester, who has a
troupe of dogs that act, and of course
Billy Is the star.
Billy began his career as a hoodoo, and
he can thank some lucky dog-star that
before the hoodoo was broken he did not
find his way to the sausage mill or the
fertilizer factory.
Six years ago Miss Chester was travel
ing with another dog performing the same
act. She knew that only the ugliest of
plaster of paris dogs live always, and
she began to look about for a pose dog
to act as understudy. In Chicago she
found Billy and )his sister, Lilly. Their
pure white coats presented wonderful pos
sibilities! considered in connection with
black backgrounds. It was after she had
given her check for a good big sum that
the dealer told her their birthday was
August 13.'
, A brace of boodoos. But the dealer was
relentless, and Miss Chester couldn't get
her; money back, so she packed the pair,
off to her father, who knows how to train
dogs. In two weeks her old dog was
dead.
"Thirteen," said Miss Chester. "I knew
it."
That meant all dates canceled until the
new dogs were trained. Ten months Miss
Chester and her father spent on them,
and Just as, Lilly was ready for the stage
she took cold, had congestion of the
lungs and died
"Thirteen," said Miss Chester. '. "I knew
It"; -. -â¢: -. .V Â¦ '-.'.-
Now, Billy had never shown particular
aptitude for tricks. His sister had always
stood at the head of this class of two,
while Billy persistently refused to Jearn.
By w*ay of punishment he was thrown
Into a. kennel, where he lived and fought
wiÂ£h .fifty other dogs for three weeks.
When he came out he was sobered and
ready to take a serious view of life.
The teaching of these dogs is a long and
te/ilous taskâ at least three hours a day,
and sometimes as high as* seven. Billy
had to learn j to pose alone with . Miss
Chester, then on the stage with strange
surroundings, then . to stand unrhovel
with the blinding footlights before his
eyes and the roar of applause In his ears.
'Once Billy knuckled down to business,
however, he made up' for lost time, and
exactly thirteen months from the day he
was born he was ready for the stage.
"Thirteen," said Miss Chester. "Will he
die, refuse to work or go mad?" ' .;
He did neither, and from that'day Miss
Chester's hoodop was broken. To-day she
declares thirteen her lucky number. t
"Billy is the best dog I ever had," says
Miss Chester. never sulks or gets
angry, and no" matter how I feel I can
always depend on him. ...
. "Billy's education was certainly not a
matter of intelligence. I hold the corn-
mon street cur is more apt to learn than
the finest bred dog In the world. If I
were to let Billy loose on the street he
would be killed in five minutes. He
wouldn't know enough to get out of the
way of street cars and heavy trucks,
while the commonest curs never get hurt.
"This dog is absolutely dependent on
me. He will not cross a street until I tell
him^t is safe. In fact, I never leave him
out of sight for five minutes.
"Oh, no; I'm not afraid of his being
poisoned; for he will eat nothing from a
stranger until I tell him 'it is paid for';
nor will he drink water until I give him
permission."
i Billy has a right to hold his nose rather
high in the air, for it was only the last
time* he was In London that the Duke of
Cambridge . sent a i messenger to M'sa
Chester after the performance with a
check for Â£2000. He wanted tha dog, and
it didn't occur to him that Â£2000 of ducal
money was not half-enough to buy Billy.
Another thing, Billy can travel free on
the Old Dominion steamships whenever
he pleases, with the privilege of sleeping
in a stateroom. It happened this wayx
During one of Billy's voyages across the
ocean the customary concert for the ben
efit of sailors was given. Billy remained
modestly In the background until the end
of the concert, when Miss Chester gave
him a small basket and told him to "take
up a collection."
He did It. pausing before each one with
the persistence of a vestryman, and when
he completed the round he had nearly
5100 In the basket. After that the boat
was his.

the matter with his lines until he hears
them. Clyde Fitch writes his plays while
Uiey are being rehearsed. Just as Worth
builds a pown upon his patron. It Is a
matter of experimenting, of trying, of
changing a little here, a little there, of
letting the work crow.
Now Charles Bryant kfcew this and he
likewise knew that it Is a very hard mat
ter to build a play while the Alcazar stock
company is rehearsing it- They are the
drudges of the profession who are given
a complete set of brand new parts every
Tuesday morning and are expected to
play those same parts the following Mon-
day night. In a week of rehearsals there
is no time to build a play.
So he hit upon the idea of speaking
what he had written ioto a phonograph,
then of letting the phonograph rehearse
under his critical ear.

The scene was in 'the thfrd act, in the

So the staging of a new play In this

"Hettie, It -was very good of you to

Welling. ;' Â¦Â¦
"But I should not have come hero to

Â«. The manager began to rise , from his
peaceful position in the easy' chair.
"Why not, Hettie?" went on the amor- ,
ous lieutenant.
"Because Esther does not' know I am
here. I promised her that I would not

It had looked delightful when it was
on-paper. But "Whew!" said â¢> the stage
director, now he was listening to it as
from the audience.
It kept on going, for it was letter per

"Do you think your sister would, ob

persisted the lieutenant, i .
"Oh, I am sure she would," protested
the timid, damsel.
"Stop!" roared the stage director. He
made.fqr the switch, turned off the cur
rent and the phonographic actor made
love no more. "Â¦
Then he drew his blue pencil and made
at tha scene with it.
One slash and the scene was finished.
It has never appeared upon the stage and
never will.
"Of all the absurdities it was the most
absurd," Bryant says. "Of all fool girls
I was making her the most foolish. It
was an insult to the lady. It was girly
glrly. It was abominably prudish.
"Whea- I went- to work to rewrite the
scene, I brought out: the idea of the sis

After the aasslgnment of the roles came
the choosing of the costumes. Thesa
were described In general terms to each
member of the cast, then they were told
to put their heads ' together in choosing
them so that colors should not clash. ThÂ«
Still another piece of work is tha ar
ranging for stage noises. Bryant has
utilized his phonograph for this. A chor r
us recorded upon It is used to give tha
effect of distant singing, and the bugla
call is one that was bugled by the most
famous trumpeter in the United States
army. This Is something of a revolution
in the matter of stage noises and it opens
up all kinds of possibilities for distant ef
fects.
Every one of these workers depended
upon the pasteboard models made in tha
beginning by the scenic artist. They
are perfectly proportioned, built to a
scale by the aid of the carpenter, and so
complete that they could be sent to* any
theater in the United States and carried
out from the miniature. Even the more
important of the properties are modeled,
such as the shelf and the pump. Tha
trees are in position, the gate and the
fence are shown. With this model before
him the electrician studies the placing
of his lights, the property man selects
his properties, the stage manager assigns
places to his characters.
For thl3 production, with everything
new, the rehearsals of lights and scenery
were going on a long time before tha
opening night. The moon had to be put
through Its paces, and the man behind
the moon had to be- instructed not to fall
asleep as he has been known to do, wak
ing late and jumping the moon up into
the skies, three feet at a jump, to rnaka
up for lost time. The electrician's work
had all to be put through rehearsals,
from his rippling lake to his electric fire
in the fireplace of the best room.
Next came the labor of the property
man. He was shown the models of thÂ»
different scenes and told what was want
ed to furnish them. There must be cur
tains for the best room, flower pots for
the window-sill, candlesticks for the man
tel piece. There must be a pump for the
yard. Everything to bÂ« handled, to bÂ«
used, comes under the Jurisdiction of the
property man.
The lake, a surface of translucent ma
terial, was the hardest proposition. It Is
stationary; under It are moving lights,
constantly shifting, changing color, glim,
mering. This la the trick of moonlight on
the water. The light, not the water, toes
the rippling.
The moon was arranged to work by
means of a windlass, and the man who
managed the windlass was instructed not
to let It rise In leaps, as ha Is prone to do.
the effects wanted for the dying day.
â¢ Next came an interview with the elec
trician. Take the orchard scene, for in-
The artist disappeared to make his
model, for this mimic stage of pasteboard
is the foundation upon which everybody
else's work is built.
'.The artist was given the roughest kind
of a diagramâ a group of lines which
merely indicated the skeleton of the stage
setting. / "This scene is an orchard," he
â¢was told. "There's to be a lake here, a
practical tree here, a fence and gate on
this side. Make your model."
"When the Heart Was Young" called
for three brand new scenes. After the
play was written, long before the part3
were assigned, the playwright-manager
called in the scenic artist and began the
planning of these scenes.
being staged.
' When the powers of the earth and the
air and the water take to storming like
this you may know that a new play is
But the rehearsing of the lines is only
one part of the staging of a new play.
The lights and scenery have their rehear
sals, too, late at night after the player
folk have departed. Then is when you
might hear:'
"Look out for that moon! It's going to
explode!"
"Confound you, turn the breeze loose!"
"What in thunder's the -matter with the
lake? That's its cue to begin to ripple." {
Sometimes the playwright manager
found that a scene sounded far better
than he had hoped. The long speech in
which Seth tells Silas that he is going to
leave "Medder View," tells him why he
loves it, how it "makes him feel happy
like f know thet Martha kin still see our
old home"â this was the speech that the
playwright was most afraid of, being the
longest in the play. But when he turned
it over and heard it he found that it didn't
bore him and he took hope. Rehearsals
proved that the thing didn't call for a
single stroke of the blue pencil.
" 'I've taken her home. If you ever
speak to her again I'll break your damned
neck.' " .
"Awful," wasn't It. Just what the of
fended hero always says. Real men don't
talk like that, and I wanted real men In
this' play. This was how the line was re
written after I had heard it:
ever dare to speak to her again I will
thrash you within. an inch of your life,
if I die for' it* ;

The Mobile Boer.
The most recent and up-to-date book on

Two Burghers, which has just been is

The authors, Captain John A. Hassell

character of the South African patriots.
The reader of this vivid description of
stirring events In rapid succession can
obtain a very thorough idea of the democ

The authors, who have been so closely

dp full justice to the BoÂ«r side in tho
struggle. The publication of the book just
at this time has been specially urged be
cause the authors have discovered a â¢ re

or interest on the part of the American
public, and they say they have been im

misconception prevailing as to the real
character of the combat, the forces em
ployed and the reasons for Boer successes
and failures. The narrative of "Captain

McClure, Phillips & Co.* New York, are

o6nUy appeared from the pen of Henry

that he has to play in a love story of his

This was Dick's break. There was no reason
why he should be embarrassed. -
"I think you must be Mr. Ormsby," said the
vision. "My name is Nancy Reynolds."
A great light broke upon Ormsby's brain,
and an unholy joy took possession of Iiis soul.
So this was Rollins' little game'. Verily, the
gods were rood.
"It is awfully unfosfunate," he said feeling
ly. "There has been some mistake about the
telegram. He will be dreadfully cut up."
He didn't mention that Rollins was, at that
moment, on his way to take the yoang woman
to dinner and to the theater. Why go into de
tails?
'Tve sent away my cab. Really, you know,
it is all rather provoking."
The vision was evidently irritated. As evi
dently her sense of humor was wrestling with
her wrath. Moreover, if gray eyes are to be
believed, she did not consider It necessary to
visit her anger upon the innocent friend of the
guilty Rollins.
"I will telephone for a cab, but you mustn't
stand heie in the hall. Won't you come in and
wait?"
Ormsby looked at the eyes, and threw his
chum overboard without a shadow of com
punction. After all, Rollins hadn't played fair.
She hesitated, then followed hiin down thÂ«
narrow hall to the drawinc-room.
"Perhaps the imposing person wjio opened
the door for me can chaperon us," she said,
with a touch of embarrassment. "I'm afraid
it is all distinctly unconventional. Bachelor
apartments and a strange young man and no
chaperon within seventy blocks. Will you
please tell the cabman to hurry?'
Ormsby obeyed orders. It comforted his soul
to realize that New York cabmen are imper
vious to such orders. He was glad that he
had had the forethought to telephone to Sixty
thiM street for a cab. Instead of ordering one
around the corner. A young woman couldn't
be expected to know anything about the tele
phone numbers of cab stables, even when she
heard them called. Occasionally a mental pic
ture of a gouty old gentleman in a Uotel room
arose and smote the old gentleman's son with
horror, but the awesome vision died away In a
glow of rose pink and red gold. One's readi
ness to pay the piper depends upon the quality
of the dance. J
"It's a terrible grind on DIcl?," said Dick's
chum, with fine relish. Nancy* looked pathetic.
Â¦When Nancy drifts into gentle pathos,, men
who know her will reach for life-preservers,
but Ormsby did not know her. : (

*yi SERIES of sketches that should
f I prove popular for light reading
fâ H among the fair sex is "The Mls-
X, I demeanors of isancy," by Eleanor
JL Hoyt. These sketches have been
appearing in Everybody's Magazine, and
so those who have already made the ac
quaintance of the capricious and alto
gether charming Miss Nancy Reynolds
Â¦will be frlad to know that the whole series
of her "misdemeanors" is to be had in
book form, as recently published by Dou
ble&ay. Page & Co. of New York.
The book is written with that same de
lightful touch that made the "Dolly Dia
logues" so popular, and placed "The Let-'
ters of Elizabeth" among the best sellers
et last year. 'What we may expect from
this fascinatingly disreputable young per
â¢ea Â«f whom we may hardly approve, but
It is easy to adore, Is suggested In our in
troduction to her when It Is explained by
Nancy herself:
"When & Kentucky belle marries a New
Hampshire lawyer there are rocks ahead
for coming 1 generations," she reasoned,
luring settled herself on the arm of her
father's chair and rumpled his gray hair
Into hopeless untidiness.
"Given Kentucky Impulses and a New
Hampshire conscience, what can one do?
You really shouldn't expect much of me.

&aÂ£ghboÂ» I would be frostily sewing flan

"I wash my hands of It. You two dear
things ore responsible. I'm tremendously
Rorry I can't marry inejlgibillty to please
myself or eligibility to please youâ but
there you are."
Eleven of Nancy's misdemeanors are
chronicled in the present record, and all
of them make very amusing: reading. She
breaks more hearts to the page than the
best historical novel hero can break heads
m a chapter; which is quite a relief after
the siege we have been having of these
sanguinary gentlemen. The sketches have
been illustrated by Penrhyn Stanlaws,
â¢whose delicate line work is just suited to
the subject. One of them, which is re
produced above, shows Nancy on the golf
Units engaged in the arduous task of tir
ing out her chaperonâ "Aunt Maria * â¢ â¢
who has the endurance of the early mar
tyrs."
An excerpt from one of the stories.
"Where Friendship Ceases." shows the
author's subtle power of entertaining.
Rollins and Ormsby are chums living in
bachelor apartments. Rollins is of a po
,etical turn of mind, and up to the time
cf the present incident it has always been
hi* custom to rave to his chum of the
inarms cf his friends of the fairer sex.
When he meets Nancy his mind takes a
turn and he is so impressed by this vis
ion of loveliness that he decides to keep
his find to himself and not to run the
risk of presenting her to the attractive
' and handsome Ormsby. He wishes to
give Nancy, of course duly chaperoned, a
dinner at their apartments, but will not
risk the presence of Ormsby; so he waits
until his chum's father arrives in town
and Ormsby has announced that on a cer
tain day he will go out to dine with the
eld gentleman. It is quite necessary that
Ormsby shall be devotion itself on these
visits of his parent, for, besides having
the gout and the accompanying temper
that goes with that aristocratic affliction,
the old gentleman holds his money in a
close fist, and Ormsby depends for his
living on the parental bank account.
At this stage all seems well for the
scheming Rollins. Ormsby is quite. In the
dark about the prospective dinner and also
of Rollins' new adoration.
Ordinarily Onnsby leaves hU office' at I
o'clock, but that afternoon, as luck and thr
typewriter would have it, he was shockingly
delayed. He had promised to join his father
at the hotel at 6 o'clock. At 6:45 he rush-d
home to dress, reflecting gloomily the while
that the governor was probably making th<=
air round him violently ultramarine and pre
paring for the prodigal son a variety of veal
that would be swallowed with difficulty.
In the hall he met Watkint. There were no
signs ef prospective festivity in the dining
room.
""Where's the dinner party?" he asked, as he
jammed pearl studs into a dress shirt.
"The cook left at noon," said Wutkins. with
the solemn joy of one who announces dire ca-
"Tbe 2euce she did'. Then the dinner's off?"
"Mr. Rollins telegraphed to the guests, sir."
"Where's Rollins?"
"He'e gone to get the young lady who was
coning, Â«4r. He'e soing to take her to dinner
and to the theater."
"Young lady! Why he didn't say â who was
â¢he. Watlclnsr'
"I couldn't Â«ay, e\r. Mr. Rollins didn't men
tion the name."
Ormsby was struggling with his tie. He
flrepped the conversation, also several expres
sions more forcible than Christian In regard to
tht man who first Invented neckties.
TiiÂ« doer bell rang.
TVttkirs disappeared.
Orrctfcy, ricking op Ms overcoat and looking
M088& hopelessly for his opera hat, heard a
*cjt feminise voice saying:
"Jtr. Eolllne lives here?"
"Yet, miss," came la 'Watkins' best company
Â¦Â¦cerate, "but be isn't in at present, miss."
"jsot tor* â¢;.Â»', :
Tbere was a note of embarrassment aad a
Â¦whole gamut of surprise In the Â«cho.
*1?o, xnlss. He's gone out to dinner and the
theater."
"But you are entertaining at dinner this
â¢veiling?"
Tbe embarrassment bad deepened. The sur
prise had melted into consternation.
' "I bey pardon, rules, but the oook left, unex
pected like, at noon, and Mr. Rollins bad to
telem-apli the guests not to come."
There vas a gasp, distinctly audible In
Orznisby's room.
He drew aside the curtain and stepped Into
the hall. VTaUcins obliterated himself. A
vision In a soft, shimmering pink gown and
hood and a lone cloek <jf lace and fur etood
In the doorway. Her head was .held \-ery high.
Her clÂ«eclcÂ» were uncommonly pink. The cray
eyes that met Ormsby' s were half indignant,
half amused, wholly beautiful.
Orn^by didn't, know her. He felt convinced
at once that not knowing ber had been a bit
of beastly bad luck.
VI have come to dinner," said tbe vision
firmly, but with a lurkins dimple threatening
to dasb Into the open.
"You didn't cet a dispatch from Dick?"
She tht.uk her head. The chiffon hood dipped
back, disclosing a distracting arrangement of
golden fluffines? rippllns into gold brown
Ehadow.
"I v/iia invited to dine here at 7," she said.
"Â¦Your man tells me the cook is gone. Did you,
by any chance, cave the chaperon?"
Onneby'e attention was gliding; giddily over
the ripples, but he tried to pull himself Into
coherence.
"I the other people sot their tele
grams. Nobody's here. I don[t "understand.
Dick â¢ has goue toâ I suppose â he didn't
tell " He was stammering Joyously and In.
wardly cursing himself for a blundering fool.
a "lly sympathy is all "for 'myself.'* she said.
"Of course this is all very charming:," ; she
sdded, with a glance that neutralized the chill
into which her first remark-had cast Ormsby
and raised hia temperature to fever heat, "but
âbut It really Is embarrassing, and " 'she

l^abor is divided Into two great armies
âthe agricultural and the industrial. In
these diverse forces are in operation. In
the former everything tends to a further
distribution Â»f land among the many; In
tht latter everything tends to a concen
tration of business In the handb of the
few. One* of the two great fallacies upon
vhich "Progress and Poverty"â Mr
George's bookâ is founded, is that the
land is getting more and more into the
bands cf the few. Now the only source
from which Mr. George could obtain cor
rect information upon this point is the
census, and this tells us that in 1850 the
average extent of farms in the United
States was 203 acres; in 1SC0. VTi acres; in
1LT0, 153 acres, and that in 1880 it was stiU
iuriher reduced to 134 acres. The reason
is obvious for this rapid distribution ot
the land. The farmer who cultivates a
small farm by his own labor is able to
drive out of the field the ambitious cap
italist who attempts to farm upon a large
scale with the labor of others. In Great
Britain nothing has been more significant
than that the tillers of small farms have
passed through the agricultural depres
sion there far better lhau those w^o cul
tivated large farms. So In both coun
tries we have proof that under tbe free
play cf cuual laws land is becoming
more and more divided among the masses
of the people. In the whole range of
social questions no faci is more im
portant than this, and nothing gives the
ihous'ht/ul student greater satisfaction.
The triumph ofahe small proprietor over
The trouble* Is that men ar* not paid
at any time the compensation proper to
that time. All large" concerns necessarily
keep filled with orders, say/ for six
months in advanoe, and these orders are
taken, of course, at prices prevailing
when they are booked. This year's oper
ations furnish perhaps the best Illustra
tion of the difficulty. , Steel rails at the
end of last year for delivery this year
were -$29 per ton at the works. Of oourae
the mills entered orders freely at this
price, and kept on entering them until
the demand growing unexpectedly great
carried prices up to $35 per ton. Now the
various mills in America are compelled
for the next six months or more to . run''
upon orders which do not average $31 per
ton, at the seaboard and Pittsbui g, and
say $34 at Chicago. Transportation, iron
stone, and prices of all Kinds have ad
vanced upon them in the meantime, and
they must therefore run for the bulk of
the year upon very small margins of
profit. But the men noticing in the pa
pers the "great boom in steel rails," very
naturally demand their share of the ad
vance, and under our existing faulty ar
rangements between capital and labor
they, have secured It. The employers,
therefore, have grudgingly given what
they know under proper arrangements
they/should not have been required to
give; and there has been friction and still
Is dissatisfaction upon the part of ,the
employers. Reverse this picture. The
steel-rail market falls again. The mills
have still six months' work, at prices
above, the prevailing market, and can'af-"
.ford to -pay men higher wages 'Â¦ .'than the
then existing state of the market would
apparently justify. But having Just been
amerced in extra payments for labor
which they should ; not have paid, they
naturally attempt to reduce wages as the
market price of rails go down, and there

THE BEST. s
.The people of America can smile at the
efforts of all her railway magnates and of

THE ETJTCRE OF TBTTSTS. j
That business offers advaatajr** ere*
other; careers seem* to Sir. Carnegie in
disputable:
Perhaps I may be permitted, without
going too far beyond the scop* of my
text, to make a few remarks upon th* In
fluence of a business career upon men. as
compaied with other pursuits. â¢ -V .â¢;Â¦Â¦-â¢
First, then, I have learned that th* ar
tistic'career is most narrowlnar. and pro
duces such petty Jealousies, unbounded
vanities and spltefulness as to furnish one
with a. great contrast as to what I have
found In men of affairs. Muslo, painting,
sculpture,* one would think, should prove
most powerful In their beneficent' effects
upon those who labor with them as their
daily vocation. Experience, however, is
against this. Perhaps because the work,
or the performance, of artists Is so highly
personal, so clearly seen, being brought
directly before the public, that petty pas
sions are stimulated; however that may
be, I believe It will not be ' controverted
that the artistic mind becomes prejudiced
and narrow. But, understand, I speak
only of classes and of the general effect;
everywhere we find exceptions which ren
der^ the average still more unsatisfactory.
In regard to what are called the learned
professions Ve notice the effect produced
â¢by specialization In a very marked de
gTee, : .
Ital has done Its part. It Ins ptcTWed hJ!
the/ instrumentalities of production; but
unless it can command the services of
able men to manage the business? all that
Capital has done crumbles into ruin.
Then comes the third partner, last in
the order of time but not least. Labor. If
it fails to perform Its part nothing can bo
accomplished. Capital and BuslnMs Abil
ity without Labor brought into play are
dead. Tha wheels cannot revolve unless
the hand of Labor starts them.
, Now, .volumes can be written as to
-. which one of the three Â¦ partners' is first,
second or third in importance,, and the
subject will remain just as it was before.
Political economists, speculative philoso
phers and preachers have been giving
their views on the subject for hundreds
of years, but i the answer has, not been
found, nor can It ever be, because each of
the three is all-important, and every j one
is equally essential >Â» to the other two.
There is no first, second or last. There is
no precedence.* They . are equal members
of the great triple alliance which moves
the industrial world. As a matter of his
tory Labor existed before Capital or Busi
ness Ability, for when' "Adam digged and
Eve span" Adam had no capital, ; and If
one may Judge from the sequel neither of
the two was Â¦ inordinately blessed with
business ability, but this was before the
reign of industrialism began and huge
investments ' of capital were necessary. .
The three are equal partners of a, grand
whole. . Combined they work wonders;
separate, neither Is of much account.
Thus far, notwithstanding the differences
that from" time , to time have unfortunate
ly, rent them". apart, ''they: have" made the
closing century -the most beneficent of all
that have come and. gone. 7 Humanity the
world over, is ' better "than it has ever
been," materially and morally, and I have
the faith that it Is destined to reach still
higher and loftier planes than even the
most sanguine have imagined.
Capital, ;, Business _ Ability and j Labor
must be united. He is an: enemy to all
three. who seeks to sow seeds of disunion
among. them. ,
arise* discontent among the men, and we
have a repetition of the negotiations and
strikes which have characterised the be
ginning of this year. In other j words,
when the employer Is going down
employe Insists on going up, and vice ver
sa. What we must . seek Is a clan by
which men will receive high wages when
their employers are receiving high prices
for the product, and -hence are making
large profits; 'and per' contra, when the
employers are" receiving low prices for
product, and therefore small If any prof j
its, the men will receive low wages. If
this plan can be found, employers and
employed will be "in the same boat," re
joicing together in j their prosperity and
calling into play their fortitude together
In, adversity.. There will be no room for
quarrels and Instead of a feeling of. an
tagonism there" will be , a feeling , of part
nership between employers and employed.
There is a simple mean of producing this
result, and to its general introduction
both employers and employed should
steadily bend tbolr energies. Wages
should be based upon a- sliding scale, in
proportion to Â¦ the net prices received for
product month by month. [ It is Impossi
ble for capital to defraud labor under &
sliding scaie. . '
THE SLIDING SCALE.
The importance of the subject is sug
gested by the fact that the habit of thrift
constitutes one of the greatest differences
between the savage and the civilized man.
One of the fundamental differences be
tween "savage and" civilized life is the ab
sence of thrift in the one and the pres
ence of it in the other. When millions of
men each save a little of their daily earn
ings, these petty sums combined make
an enormous amount, which Is called cap
ital, about which so much is written. If
men consumed each day of each week all
they earned, as does the savage, of course
there would be no capitalâ that is, no
savings laid up for future use.
Now, let us see what capital does in the
world. We will consider what the ship
builders when they have to build great
ships. These enterprising companies of
fer to build an ocean greyhound for, let
us say, Â£500.000, to be paid only when the
ship is delivered after satisfactory trial
trips. Where or how do the shipbuilders
get this sum of money to pay the work
men, the wood merchant, the steel manu
facturer, and all the people who furnish
material for the building of the ship?
They get it from the savings of civilized
men. It is part of the money saved for
investment by the millions of industrious
people. Each man. by thrift, saves a
little, puts the money in a bank and the
bank lends it to the shipbuilders, who pay
interest for the "use of it. It Is the same
with the building of a manufactory, a
railroad, a canal, or anything costly. We
could not have had -anything more than
the savage had except for thrift. ;
As a rule, you will find that the saving
man is a temperate man, a good husband
and father, a peaceful, law-abiding citi
zen. Nor need the saving be great. It Is
surprising how little It takes to provide
for the real necessities of life. A little
home paid for and a few hundred pounds
âa very fewâmake all the difference.
These are more easily acquired by frugal
people than you might suppose. Great
wealth is quite another and a far less de
sirable matter. It Is not the aim of thrift
nor the duty of men to acquire millions.
It is in no respect a virtue to set this be
fore us as an end. Duty to save ends
when Just money enough has been put
aside to prdvide comfortably for those
dependent upon us. Hoarding millions Is
avarice, not thrift.
Of course, under our industrial condi
tions. It is - inevitable that a few", a very
few men,- will find money coming to them
far. beyond their wants. The accumula
tion of millions is usually the result of en
terprise and judgment, and some excep
tional ability for organization. It . does
not ' come , from savings in the
ordinary sense ot that word. Men
who in old age strive . only to
increase their already great hoards are
usually slaves of the habit of hoarding
formed in their youth. At first they own
the money they have made and saved.
Later in life the money owns them, and
they cannot help themselves, so overpow
ering is the force of habit, either for good
or evil. It is the abuse of the civilized
saving Instinct and not its use, that pro
duces this class of men. , 'Â¦Â¦''^ : 7~
No one need be afraid of falling a'vic
tim ! of this abuse of the habit if heal-
Trays bears in mind that whatever surplus
wealth may come to him is to be regard
ed as a sacred trust, which he is bound to
administer for the good of his fellows.
The man should always be master. He
'should keep money in the position of a
useful servant. He must never let it
master and make a miser of him.

a manager is" not the man himself, but the
men with whom he is able to surround
himself. These books on the shelves will
tell you the story of the rise of many
men from our own ranks. It is not the
educated, or so-called, classically educated
man. It is not the aristocracy, it is not the
monarchs. that have ruled the destinies of
the world, either in camp, council, labora
tory or workshop. The great inventions,
the implements, the discoveries in science,
the great works En literature have sprung
from the ranks of the poor. You can
scarcely name a great invention, or a
great discovery. 'you can scarcely name a
jrreat picture, or a great statue, a great
song or a great story, ncr anything great
that has not been the product of men
who started like yourselves to earn an
honest living by honest work-
The young practical man of to-day
working at the bench or counter, to whom
the fair goddess. Fortune, has not yet
btclicned. may be disposed to conclude
that it is impossible to start business in
this age. There is something in that. It
â¢s. no doubt, infinitely more difficult to
start a. new business of any kind to-day
than It -was. But It is only a difference in
form, not in substance. It is infinitely
easier for a.joung practical man of ability
to obtain an interest in existing firms thaji
it has ever been. The doors have not
closed \i\yon ability; on the contrary, they
swing easier upon their hinges. Capital
Is not requisite. Family influence, as be
fore, passes for nothing. Real ability, the
rapacity for doing things, never was so
eagerly searched for as now, and never
commanded such rewards.
The Itw which concentrates the leading
industries and commercial, mercantile and
financial affairs in a. few great factories
or linns contains within itself another law
not less imperious. These vast concerns
cannot be successfully conducted by sal
aried employes. No great business of any
kind can score an unusually brilliant and
permanent success which Is not in the
hands of practical men pecuniarily inter
ested in its results. It has been necessary
for me to watch closely most of my life
the operations of great establishments
owned by hundreds of absent capitalists
and conducted by salaried officers. Con
trasted with these, I believe that the part
nership conducted by men vitally inter
ested and owning the works will make
satisfactory dividends when the corpora
tion ia embarrassed and scarcely knows
upon -which side the balance ia to be at the
end of a year's operations. The great dry
goods houses that interest their most
capable men In the, profits of each de
partment succeed, when those fail that
endeavor to -work with salaried men only.
Even In the management of our great ho
tels. It is found wise to take into partner
chip the principal men. In every branch
of business this law is at work and. con
cerns are prosperous, generally speaking,
just in proportion as they succeed in in
teresting In the profits a larger and larger
proportion of their ablest workers. Co
operation In this form is fast coming in
all great establishments. The manufac
turing business that does not have practi
cal manufacturing partners had better
supply the omission -without delay, and
probably the very men required are the
bright younf mechanics who have distin
guished, themselves while working for a
few dollars per day or the youths from
th* polytechnlo school.

"When we turn to the other army of la
borâthe industrialâ we are obliged to con
fess that it is swayed by the opposite
law, which tends to concentrate manu
facturing and business affairs generally
in a few vast establishments. The fall in
prices of manufactured articles has been
startling. Never were the principal arti
cles of consumption so low as they are
to-day. This cheapening process is made
possible only by concentration. We find
1700 watches per day turned out by one
company, and watches are sold for a few
dollars apiece. We ha*ve mills making
many thousand yards of calico per day.
and this necessary article is to be had
for a few cents pÂ«r yard. Manufacturers
of steel make 2500 tons per day, and four
pounds of finished steel are sold for 5
cents. And so on through the entire
range of industries. Divide the huge fac
tories Into smaller establishments and it
will be found impossible to manufacture
some of the articles at ail. the success
of the process being often dependent on
its being operated on a large scale, while
the cost of such articles as could be pro
duced In small establishments would be
two or three times their present price.
There does not appear to be any coun
teracting force to this law of concentra
tion In the Industrial world. On the con
trary, the active forces at work seem to
demand greater and greater output or
turn-over from each establishment in or
der that the minimum of cost should be
reached. Hence comes the rapid and con
tinuous increase of the capital of manu
facturing: and commercial concerns, five,
ten. fifteen and even twenty millions be
ing- sometimes massed in one corporation.
THK1FT DISTmGTJTSHES

FROM THE SAVAGE.
-"the Old open. Freedom for all to engage
in railroad building when and where cap
ital desires, subject to conditions open to
all. Freedom for all to engage in any
branch of manufacturing under like con
ditions.
There can be no permanent extortion ot
profit beyond the average return from
capital, nor any monopoly, either m trans
portation or manufacturing. Any attempt
to maintain either must end In failura,
and failure ultimately disastrous just in
proportion to the temporary success of
the foolish effort. It is simply ridiculous
for a party of men to meet In a room and
attempt by passing resolutions to -change
the great laws which govern human af
fairs in the business world, and this*,
whether they be railway presidents, bank
ers or manufacturers.
The fashion of trusts has but a short
season longer to run, and then some other
equally vain device may be expected to
appear when the next period of depression
arrives; but there Is not the' slightest dan
ger that serious injury can result to the
sound principles of business from any or
aM of these movements. The only people
who have reason to fear trusts are those
foolish enough to enter Into them. The
consumer and transporter, not the man
ufacturer and railway owner, are to reap
the harvest.
Maxims.
Mr. Carnegie's new book, "The Empire
of Business," is at times epigrammatic In
its declarations and these terse state
ments are easily carried in the mind. It
is hardly possible to forget such sentence*
as these:
Aim for the highest.
Do* not touch liquor, or, If at all, only
at meals.
Never speculate.
Never Indorse beyond your surplus cash
!unds. i
Make the firm's interest yours.
Break -orders always to save owner*.
Concentrate.
Expenditure always within revenue.
The trouble is men are not paid at any
;ime the compensation proper to that
lime.
Every employer of labor is anxiously
itudying the men around him.
The millionaires are the bees or the
live, not the drones.
Capital, business ability and labor must
3e united in any enterprise.
The fashion of trusts has but a short
leason longer to run. - J
It is infinitely easier for a young/prac-
Jcal man of ability to obtain an interest
n existing firms to-day than ever before.
Subdivision, specialization is the order
jf the day. 'â¢
The habit of thrift constitutes .one of
ihe greatest differences between the sav
ige and the civilized man. â¢
I have never yet met a man who fully
anderstood two different kinds of bust-,
leas.
The millionaire' who tolls on is the
:heapest article which the community Â«e
;ures at the price It pays for him, name \ .
iia shelter, clothing and food.
No young man .ever lived who had not

was ever employed at all. The yuung
Â¦n^n who never had a chance is the sane
poung man who has been canvassed over
ind over again by his superiors, anil
round destitute of the necessary quanti
zations.
A basketful of bond3 Is the heaviest
basket a young man ever had to carry.
[ would almost as soon leave a youiig
man a curse aa burden him with the al
mighty dollar.
I attribute most of my success in lite
to the fact that trouble runs off my Back
tlkÂ« water from a duck.
Men who in old age striv* only to in
crease their already great hordes arÂ« us
ually the slaves of the habit of hoarding
formed in their youth. . "*-,
At first they own the money; later in life
the money owns them.
College graduates will usually be found
under salaried, trusting subordinates.
It is not from the sons of the millionaire
or the noble that the world receives ua
teachers, its martyrs, its- inventors, it.;
statesmen. Its poets, or even Its men of
affairs. It is from the cottage of the pour
that all these spring.
It will be a great mistake for the com
munity to shoot the millionaires, for they
are the bees that make the most honey,
and contribute most to the hive after they
have gorged themselves full.
Money is left by millionaires to public
institutions when they must relax their
grasp upon it. There is no grace, and ran
be no blessing, in giving what cannot bo
withheld.
Wealth is being more and more distrib
uted among -the many. The amount ui.
the combined profits of labor and capita,
which goes to labor was never so great us
to-day, the amount going to capital nevÂ«r
so small.
One false axiom you will often hÂ»u>
which I wish to guard you against, "Obey
orders if you break owners." Don't you
do it. This is no rule for you to follow.
Always break orders to save owners.
There never "was a great character, who
did not sometimes smash the routine reg
ulations and make new ones for himself, j
Boss your boss just as soon as you can;
try it on early. There is nothing he wwi
like so well if he is the right kind of buss;
if he is not, he is not tne man for yuu
to remain withâ leave him whenever you
can, even at a present sacrifice, and tini
one capable of discerning genius. Our
young partners in Carnegie Brothers won
their spurs by showing that we did niu
know half as well what was wanted a*
they did.
In my own experience I can say that 1
have known few young men Intended for
business who were not injured by a col
legiate education.
Men have wasted their precious year*
trying to extract education from an ig
norant past, whose chief province is to
teach us not what to adopt, but what to
avoid. Men have sent their sons to col
leges to waste their energies upon obtain
ing a knowledge of such languages as
Greek and .Latin, which are of no mure
practical use to them than Choctaw.
"Don't put all your eggs in one basket"
Is all wrong. I tell you, "Put all your
eggs in one basket and then watch that
basket." It Is easy to watch and carry
the one basket. It is trying to carry too
many baskets that breaks most eggs in
this country. Ha who carries three bas
kets must put one on bis head, which la
apt to tumble and trip him up.
It took me lome time to learn, but I
did learn, that the supremely great man
agers, such aa you have these days, never
do any work themselves worth speaking
about, Their point Is to make otnera
work wM!Â« they think. I applied this les
son In after life, so that business witn
me has never been a care. My youns
partners did the work and I did the
laughing, and I commend to all tha
thought that there Is very little success
where there Ia little laughter.
Nothing is truer than this; that as a rule
the "almighty dollar" bequeathed to sons
or daughters by millions proves an al
mighty curse. It is not affection for the
chfld. It is self-glorification for the parent
which Is at the root of this Injurious ttia
position of wealth. There la only one
thing to be said for this mode, it lur
niahes one of the most efficacious meana
of rapid distribution of wealth Â«vÂ«r
known.
Here is a remarkable fact, that the
masses of the people In any country are
prosperous and comfortable just in pro
portion as there are millionaires.
In the old home of our race. In Britain,
which Is the richest country in all Europe
âthe richest country in the world save
one our ownâ there are more millionaires
than in the whole of the rest of Europe,
and ita_people are better off than in any
other. You come to our own land: wa
have more millionaires than in all the
rest of the world put together, although
we have not one to every ten that Is re
puted so. .
The trouble between capital and labor
Is just in proportion to the ignorance of
the employer and the ignorance of the
employed. The more Intelligent the em
ployer the better and the more . intelli
gent the employed the better. It Is never
education, it is never knowledge that
produces collision. It Is always ignorance ;
on the part of one or the other of the two
forces. Speakins from an experience not
inconsiderable. I make this statement.
Capital is ignorant of the necessities and
the just dues of labor, and labor Is igno
rant of the necessities and dangers of
capital. That Is the true origin of fri*
tlon,between them.
ma. ANDBEW CARNEGIE Is
probably the most successful
'purely business man this
country has ever known, and now
that he writes a book to. tell us all
about how he did it we shall certain
ly read it with much interest. Mr.
Carnegie created a business out of
nothing. He did not make his for
tune by commission, as a banker, 'or
by handling merchandise, as a trader,
but by manufacturing material taken
out of the surface of the earth. Ha
never speculated in a ehare of rail
road stock; he owned a complete rail
road, but built expressly for the pur
pose cf his own manufacturing in
dustry; he built mills, but never sold
them.; he created his own line of lake
steamships; he bought land and
mined his own ore, and built up from
nothing a business which was event-
nally sold to the steel trust for sev
eral hundred millions. "What a man
of this experience has to say upon the
principles 1 and practice of business is
of the very greatest importance. His
book is a clear statement of the poli
cies that have been so potent in his
success, and of present conditions of
trade in America and England,. He
divides the work into three parts:
Tirstâ Practical talks on the princi
ples governing a successful business
careen Second â Trade conditions in
America, with special reference to
steel and iron and oil and gas wells.
Thirdâ International trade relations

dishea, etc., 'are turned around on the
sharp.; ; end, of a stick. { Such things are
generally made of wood or metal, and
they lose, their balance as soon as the
turning movement gets so slow that they
cannot overcome the force of their jrav
' ity. . ;;' Â¦. 1
We will now learn how to balance a
plate on the point of a needle without the
help of rotation.
Split two corks lengthwise and stick a
fork In the end of each of the four parts,
so that they form not less than a right
angle ;with one another. Then place the
, four pieces of cork at even 'distances on
the rim of the plate, and see that the
forks touch the edge, of the plate.
J After this is done place.the plate on the
point of a needle, the head of which Is
forced in the cork of a bottle, and the
plate will balance. By careful handling
the plate can be given a rotary motion,
which will last v some time, as the friction
between the needle point and the plate is
very small.
To Balance a
Plate
on a Needle Point
BELOW is given the first set in
a series of Puzzle Pictures that
will appear in the Magazine
Section of The Call. To make the plan
of the puzzle perfectly clear let us
solve one of them. Take, for instance,
the one with tiTe, caption "Where Is
the Children's' Mother?" Turn the
picture so that the left-hand side be
comes the base; then, if you will look
carefully in the fluffy part of the um
brella you will see the mother's face
clearly outlined, while her arm and
dress are formed by the sand; the
little girl's hands are right at the
bottom of the mother's ! dress. You
see they are quite easy when you
know just where to look.* Solve them
all for yourself and then see if the
rest of . the family can â¢ do as well;
some are hard to see and others will
catch your eye at . the first glance.
On one that the answer will just seem
to pop out of , the page at you your
friend may spend hours and still not
be able to solve the problem; 'then
p-nother that seems perfectly clear to

tangled network to -your eyes. Try
them and . see for yourself.

POINTERS FOR THOSE WHO WOULD PLAY THE GAME OF PING=PONG.
striker, the nets or posts excepted. A
"let ball"Â« after the service does not count
a fault.
When a ball is not returned over the
net or fails to bounce on the table it
counts an ace against the player.
Volleying is not allowed; a ball played
before it bounces counts an ace against
the player. Half-volleying is permissible.
The game Is scored like tennis. The
player making the first ace counts 15.
Should this be the server the score Is
called "15-love"; should It be the striker
out it is called "love-15." The second ace
counts another 15, and according tÂ» who
registers the ' point the score is called
"15-all," "30-love." or "love-M." ThÂ»
player making the third acÂ« counts 40,
and~unless the score Is "40-air* the player
Â¦with the 40 points wins the game should
the next ace bÂ» scored by that player.
.,In the event of both players scoring:
three aces' (4<^all) . the game Is called a
"deuce," and the first to score an ace re
ceives "advantage." Should the aams
player win the next aie the game Is won,
but should the other player score the ace,
making a tie at advantage, the score re
verts back to deuce and so on until one
player scores two consecutive acea Im
mediately following the score of deuce.
A set is won by the player who with a
lead of two games first wins six games.
Should, however, the score of games be
6 â 5 a victory cannot be secured until a
lead of two games has been obtained, such
as 7â5 or 8^-6.
Continuous Ping-Pong , can also be
played. The service then changes at the
end of every five aces, and instead of
counting an ace as 15 It counts as one.
Should the score- be tied at 18 the players
set five, and . the one ' first winning five
aces secures . the game. At 19 the game
is set at three and the player who first
wins three aces obtains the victory. Best
of three games constitutes a set.
14 the May Era Frank A. Crowh-urst
has an exceedingly interesting, com
plete and timely account of the game
which can now be considered a craze â
"Points on Ping-Pong." It is written
plainly and is easy to understand. The
author does not have to hide lack of
knowledge by ambiguity of language, for
it Is evident that he is an experienced
player who knows the game. The follow
ing are the
REVISED RULES OF PIXG-PONG.
The game can only be played by two
persons, and each player shall take a po
sition at opposite ends of the table. The
one opening the service shall be called*
the server and the other shall be known
as the striker out
The service alternates at . the end of
every game; the server in the first game
is the striker-out in the second and the
striker-out becomes the server.
Play shall be strictly underhand. Down
ward smashing counts as fault and loses
the striker an ace.
In serving (a) the server shall stand
behind the table, and in playing the first
ball of every ace his bat must not be
over the table, but behind it. (b) The
bat handle must not be higher than the
waist and the bat itself must not be
raised above a perpendicular position.
A fault counts an ace against the player
who makes It.
The server in opening a game shall
stand at the r'ght-hand side of and serve
into the opposite square or his opponent's
right-hand court. In serving the second
ace the p. ay shall be from the opposite
corner to the opposite' court, and the
server, after calling the totals at the
conclusion of every ace, shall say, "Serve
right" or "Serve left," so as to notify
the server.
Failure to serve In the proper court
shall count an ace against the server,
there being only one service for each ace.
After the service the ball may be playfed
on any part of the table.
. Should a ball strike the top of the net
and roll into the proper court it is called
a "let ball," and the server shall play
the ball over again, but a repetition dur
ing the service of the same shall count
a fa'ult against the "server.
If the ball, before it bounces, strikes
any object either around or over the ta
ble, it shall count, a fault against the
Solution: I have not put the muslin in
the flame of the candle, but in its stead
a small piece of white linen that I have
smuggled in the piece of muslin. I have
laid the coin on it and wrapped it in it.
Then I held it in my hand, as shown in
figure, while the piece of muslin is in
side my hand, the ends hanging down.
By burning: the small piece of linen the
coin drops out. To repair the muslin, the
performer has to rub it, and secretly
hides the piece of burnt linen by smug
gling it in the hand. Then he shows the
muslin, with no signs of a burnt place.
A piece of money is wrapped in a piece
of muslin and tied with thread, as shown
in figure. I hold the coin wrapped In mus
lin near a burning candle. But â too bad! â
I came a .little too near; the trick has
been successful only in one way. The
coin !s free through the influence of the
heatâ but the muslin is destroyed. What
can we do to repair the damage? I hold
the burnt part of the muslin once more
against the candle, rub it . between my
hands, pull, smooth It, andâ the muslin
is whole; the burnt place has disappeared.

A man has received forty bottles of

he places the bottles in his cellar In such
a way that he counts always eleven bot
tles on each side, as shown in illustration.
But gradually the servant stole 4, 4, 4, 4.
and 2 bottles (altogether 18 bottles) with

Mrs. Samuel G. Buckbee Tells
Why She Objects To "My Lady"
What Mrs. Murphy
Said to the
California Club.
THE old constitution of the Califor
nia Club having, gone to eternal
smash, and as yet no new by-laws
having been passed' to regulate un
ruly members, I am about to take
advantage of the situation and
stand defiant before you, at the same
time knowing I am going deliber
ately to shock some of you j but I
am reckless, for I feel assured you
cannot suspend, reprimand nor drop m*
from your roll of membership, though- 1
should disturb the harmony â even worse,
endanger the good name of the club by
the proposition I am going to make. Â¦
Ladles, I am about to propose' the name
of a lady for admittance into our circle
who, notwithstanding her popularity and
success, beass a very cloudy reputation.
She is accused of turning the heads and
damaging the hearts of her too devoted
lovers. I may as well admit It; she cer
tainly causes Internal commotion and up
sets th* arrangement of nearly all social
bodies on her first Introduction: but her
irresistible charms arÂ« so potent that no
matter how much she may disagree with
you on first acquaintance, she succeeds In
winning you orer to her, and you soon be
com. th. be* of friend*. v .
Of course, I expect, opposition to my
candidate: I already see some of you
turning up your noses and shaking your
skirts at her; nevertheless, T am here to
champion her cause and ask your sup
port for her, for the reason that I believe
in her, am her stanch friend, having made
her my confidant and bosom friend for
some years, and can honestly affirm that
, her good qualities redeem her faults.' â¢
Now, you are all wondering who she is;
Well, I am not ashamed of her, although
I am so often sniffed at when seen In her
company. But let me formally introduce
' her. _Â¦ , v .
Madame President and Ladies,
"My .Lady Nicotine."
! of good old American stock, of whose
lineage and family connection there can
be no question; a descendant of one of
the very first families of Virginia, whose
records trace back four hundred years,
long before the Colonial Dames or .the
â¢Daughters of the Revolution were ever
thought of.
About 1580 a member of her family,
Plant Weed Tobacco Esq., accompanied
Sir Walter Raleigh to England, where he
was received with the warmest Welcome
and honors. His fascinating qualities win
ning for him a reception into the high
est circles, he. became a social power, not
ment for good into our club?
I maintain that she can. Is she not
Â¦ the personification of peace? Does not
her â¢ soothing presence Inspire good will
and calm reflection?- Her very; symbol,
the calumet, or pipe of peace, hanging
over her sanctum (for of course she will
have her own . quarters in our new club
house), of itself suggests harmony.
Again, she makes for health and length
of years by purifying the atmosphere
around her of the deadly microbes. You
never read of the death of a centenarian
but you invariably find that he or she
has been a persistent smoker and devotee
of Mme. Nicotine, for eighty or ninety
years. '
Ladles, you have all heard the Ma
dame's claim to your suffrages, and while
I realize that I. am out of order, I am.
going to ask for your votes right now;
you can't stop me for you have no by-
I laws. ?
.Â¦Â¦'â¢ Those who are in favor of ejecting Ma
', dame Nicotine will- say "ay*," those op-'
! posed ' "no."
' The ' "noes" are In . the majority. â¢ Ma
dame Nicotine is snuffed out.
only in England, but* all over Europe, and
for over 800; years his descendants -were
entertained unquestioned In every quar
ter of the" globe. â¢
But alas ! Who and what ' can . escape
of a cigarette is an art );hat men will
tell you you can never acquire without
becoming a man. Remind them that the
Spaniards have told them that they could
never acquire the , art without becoming
a Spaniard.
The trick of rolling the tobacco back
and forth, keeping It evenly distributed
along the paper, is the secret of the
whole thing. It always wants to make
itself into a flat parcel; this is just what
it must not do. It must be made round
and nothing in the .world but practice
will teach you to succeed In this.
Pile the tobacco along the paper, as
evenly as possible. Then commence the
rolling, holding .the edges of the Â¦ paper
upward between the thumbs and fore
fingers. Keeping the edges pressed to
gether, roll the tobacco with a back-and
forth motion of the thumbs and forefin
gers until you feel . It compressed and
rounded. Then tuck in the edge nearest
you. pinching it In tightly with the
thumbs; roll the other edge of the pa
per in, rolling toward yourself; wet it
and fasten the edge down, fold up the
ends and there you are.

*** tr T LADY NICOTINEâ what war
/ \ / I there has been, .over that one
I I woman!
! And now there are hints of her
being accepted.
She has made more social
squabbles than any parvenu, and yet she
is an F. F. V., as Mrs. Murphy calls to
our attention. For Mrs. Murphy, thÂ«
Judge's wife, is the champion of the
lady's cause and she it was who proposed
her for membership in the California
<"lub. She was voted down, but there are
rumors that she will be proposed again
scene fine day when the time is riper.
For cur women ar4 smoking:.
Very quietly, for the most part, with a
few" intimates. Some are bolder and open
ly declare themselves champions of the
much-discussed ; lady. Mrs. Murphy is
quite willing to do this. The Princess of
Lome is said to have done likewise, al
though she shocked her poor mother, Vic
toria, almost to death.
And now that the women have taken to
smoking, they have acquired all kinds of
dainty fads and fashions, as women al
ways do. They must have their own
cigarette cases, forsooth, and their own
match boxes to go with them. They even
have their own entire smoking sets some
times.
Borne of the very latest fashions in these
are shown on the page. The smoking set
is worth studying, for it is arranged in
quite the correct way and the same pieces
rrmst appear in every lady's set, no mat
ter what the design.
The set is the same that comes for men.
with the cisrar holder left out. .It is a
whispered fact that some of our women
are emoklng cigars, but it seems gener
ally agreed that it is not a feminine habit
and it is tabooed with many who accept
cigarettes as good form.
The set, all in pure silver, consists of
a tray for the whole, a cigaxette holder,
a match box, ash tray and lamp. These
lamps are to be had in the most charm
ing: conceits. Some are' shaped like a
chafing dish, with the little alcohol burner
cunningly hidden. Others are designed
like the old Roman lamps, those found
in the ruins of Pompeii.
ThÂ© cigarette case comes In endless de
signs of gold, silver, gun metal and
leather. The raised work in hammered
â¢liver Is the newest. Heavy designs of^
figures and faces are the most popular;
dragons and serpents are other favorites. -
The match boxes are in similar.' designs
and materials. The smartest thing
among them is a silver case made to hold
something dearer than matches. The
front of the box snaps open at an unex
pected hinge and there appears a photo
graph deftly concealed- The girls are
carrying these cases with his picture
tucked away in there Just as he carries
hers.
The gun metal cases are polka-dotted in
turquoises and amethysts.
One match box and taper holder com
bined is made of polished silver and is a
wonderfully handy little thing to have
around on a table or desk. Your light la
ever ready and the article is a charming
orr.ament in the bargain.
Of all the smoker's conveniences,
though, the most distinctly feminine is
the tiny holder made of silver wire. It
is as simple as a bent hairpin. It hooks
itself over your cigarette, Tiolds itself
there and offers a dainty silver ring to
you to be held. Not a tint of nicotine
need stain my lady's fingers when she
supports her cigarette in this wise.
Other holders fit over the end of ' the
cigarette and are the same as those used'
by men. In fact, the articles do not dif
fer. When a girl walks into the Jeweler's
and asks for a cigarette or match case
.Ahe Jeweler has no means of . knowing
whether it is for herself or her brother.
While chatelaines were still In fashion
the girl used sometimes to go to a repair
ing and odd-job jeweler and have a ring
fitted to connect the cases and the chate
laine. Now chatelaines are out and my
lady has resorted to other devices. T"
A dainty inner pocket In a coat or bo
lero jacket Is made, Just big enough to
hold the cigarette case. Sometimes it has
a second compartment to hold the
matches.

_ That there is an immediate necessity
that aid should be extended to the sur
vivors there, can be no doubt. Let the
United States lead In the act of caring
,for the stricken. She and her people
never have failed yet to be moved by the
cry of, distress which has come up from
other lands. Let us extend our sympathy

we shall but Interpret the wishes and de
sires of the humane generous American

Sympathy was on the face of every
Senator when Senator Fairbanks had con
cluded his remarks. No one. rose to make
any further statement and a vote was
taken. The Senat > unanimously passed
the bill.. It was taken at once to the
House. Then it was that . Underwood
temporarily deprived his State and the
country of opportunity to spontaneously
do a good deed.
TTNDERWOOD'S "CHARITY."
"There is./no occasion," he .said, "for a
legislative sDasm. The reports of the
situation of Martinique may be exagger
ated. Some official report should be re
ceived before action is taken."
Representative Parne of New York
urged upon 'Underwood to withdraw his
objection. Underwood persisted, however,
and the bill, under the rules', had to go
over without action until Monday. Un
derwood, who thus earned for himself
unenviable notoriety, hails from Birming
ham, Alabama, where he has posed as a
charitable citizen.. He was educated in
Kentucky and Virginia and upon gradu
ation began the practice of law. He has
been in Congress eight years. His con
duct to-day hag sub-ectcd him to harsh
criticism and one member was heard to
observe that it was apparent that not
withstanding Underwood's professions, "he
certainly did not practice charity when
he had an opportunity to do *so. \
In spite of his objection it seemed
strange that he should vote Immediately
after tho consideration of the Martinique
relief bill was postponed for a measure
appropriating money to print 6000 cop!es
of Jefferson's life of "Jesus of Nazareth."
FRANCE ACTS
PROMPTLY IN
SENDING AID
P- ARIS,-May:10.â At^a-meetmg of the
French Cabinet;, this morning * the
Minister of. Finance, 1 M. Caillaux,
: â¢ .was authorized ' to expend all the"
money necessary to succor .the sufferera
of the Martinique disaster. An official of
the Colonial Office sailed from Brest for
Martinique this morning with half a mil
lion francs (J100.000) in cash.
The Cabinet further decided to order
the half-masting of flags over all public
buildings for three days, and the Minister
of the Colonies, M. Decrals, was In
structed to telegraph' to the Government
of Martinique the condolences of France.
The Minister of Marine has received
the following undated dispatch from
Polntc-a-Pitre, Island of Gaudeloupe,
from the commander of the French cruis
er Suchet: . Â¦ Â¦
"1 have obtained the following informa
tion of the events of yesterday: About
8 o'clock the volcano threw up a' consid
erable mass of smoke and earth. A whirl
wind of fire immediately followed. In
stantly the whole* town of St. Pierre was
in flames, and the ships In the harbor
were dismasted and burned. The shower
of rocks lasted a quarter of an, hour; I
arrived at 9t. Pierre at 2 o'clock in the
afternoon, saved a few persons from the
ships. I saw no living creature in St.
Pierre, to which it was impossible to pen
etrate. There were numerous corpses
near the quay."
â¢ A telegram from" the Governor of the
island of Gaudeloupe contains the latest
"We are shocked by the intelligence
which comes to "us of the great destruc
tion of life and property on the island of
Martinique and of the probable loss to
both life and property in adjacent islands.
In a.11 history there seems to have been
but one disaster of similar ' character
which equals it. It would seem from the
reports which have come to us that it is
exceeded only by the destruction of Pom
peii. It is, indeed, to be hoped that later
Secretary Moody estimated. to-day that
the Cincinnati can coyer the 600 mile.3 sep
arating Santo Domingo and Martinique
within forty-eight hours. This would
necessitate the Cincinnati steaming at a
constant s* peed of between twelve . and
thirteen knots per hour. As she has a
maximum speed of -nineteen knots per
hour, it is apparent that she can easily
arrive at Martinique by Monday. This will
give her time to take coal aboard at San
Domingo or stop at some Intervening
point. In directing Commander -McLean
to use discretion. Secretary Moody has in
mind the fate reported to have overtaken
two relief steamers which : were sunk
while endeavoring to reach St. Pierre.
â¢ The action of the Senate upon -the bill
for the relief of sufferers of Martinique
has earned for that body the warmest
praise of officials and diplomats. ' Senator
Fairbanks offered the bill which appro
priated $100,000 and authorized the Presi
dent of the United States to expend It In
the purchase of such "provisions, cloth
ing, medicine and other necessaries as
he shall deem advisable and tender the
same In the name of the Government of
the United States to the Government of
France for the relief of citizens who have
suffered by tho late disaster in the islands
of the French West Indies." Thlj bill fur T
\ ther authorizes the Secretary of War to
use the necessary steamships belonging
to .the .United States to carry its purpose
into effect. ; .
Senator Fairbanks requested immediate
consideration of thq measure, saying:
:â¢' NEED FOR RELIEF.
"Order Dixie to prepare for sea as soon
as practicable. Report when she can be
ready."
As more than one ship might be needed.
Secretary Moody also telegraphed this
message to the commandant of the New
York navy yard:
DIXIE WILL SAIL.
"Proceed to Martinique. Render such
assistance as' possible. Use your discre
tion. Report by cable when practicable.
Correspondents of American newspapers
can go if you arc willing."
The State Department,, having been
notified late this afternoon that the situa
tion in Santo Domingo was more orderly.
Assistant Secretary of State Hill called
upon Secretary of the Navy Moody and
suggested, in the light of this Informa
tion, that the Cincinnati dr directed' to
porceed to Martinique. Secretary Moody
and Rear Admiral Taylor, Chief of the
Bureau of Navigation, had been consid
ering the advisability ot'orderlng the ves
sel to Martinique and earlier in the. day
had indicated to Captain Yates Stirling,
commandant of the naval station at San
Juan, that he might dispatch the ocean
tug Potomac to Fort de France. ' The or
ders cabled by Secretary Moody to Com
mander McLean, commanding the Cin
cinnati, read:
The department has made inquiries of
Consuls at other points in the West In
dies and within forty-eight hours .hopes
to be advised of the ex^nt of the dam
age wrought by the eruption.
This was an anxious day for the Gov
ernment. The President is taking special
interest in the disaster, but the State De
partment was unable to furnish him with
any information. Consul Ayme at Guade
loupe suggested yesterday that he be per
mitted to proceed to Martinique and Sec
retary Hay cabled him permission this
morning. He Is now on his way, having
sailed on the French man-of-war Suchet,
which is carrying supplies to the destitute
of the devastated island. ' .\
CONSULS ARE CABLED.
The action of the administration was
indorsed and supplemented .by tho Sen
ate to-day, which passed a bill appror
priatlng $100,000 for the relief of the dis
tressed of Martinique. This bill would
have gone through the House with the
.same impressive promptness that it re
ceived action in the Senate had .it not
been for the officious and uncalled for
objection of Representative OBcar W.
Underwood, a parsimonious' and narrow
"statesman" from Alabama. Though suf
ficient official and unofficial information
had been received showing the awfulneas
of the catastrophe Underwood expressed
the opinion that Congress should await
the receipt of "official details," and it
will not be possible for the House to act
until .Monday, when the measure will be
taken up and passed.
' ments in Washington the
United States has taken measures for the
relief of the sufferers from the awful
cataclysm which devastated Martinique.
The cruiser Cincinnati has been ordered
to proceed to the island without delay to
investigate and report upon the situation
and extend aid to the survivors. The
ocean tug Potomac may now be on her
way from the naval station at San Juan.
The training ship Dixie has been ordered
to prepare for sea and she will be sent
to Fort de France should additional aid
be required. . . . ' ' .

DB. PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
"I do not look as
though. I ever was
sick."
When a woman is sick she falls off in
looks. This is particularly the case
when she suffers from. diseases peculiar
to her sex. Not only is her strength
undermined, but she loses beauty of
face and grace of form. . ,
It is characteristic of the cures of
womanly diseases effected by the use of
Dr.; Pierce's Favorite Prescription, that
with restored health the/e is a restora-
tion of good looks.
Â« Favorite Prescription " establishes
regularity, dries weakening drains, heals
inflammation arid ulceration and cures
female weakness.'
"I wish to thank you for the good your, medi-
cines have done me," writes Mrs. Mae Brown, ot
Canton, Fulton Co.. His. Â« I was troubled with
female weakness and doctored with several dif-
ferent doctors. â¢-, They did Hot seem to help me;
indeed I got worse all the time.* I had ulcera-
tion and displacement of the. uterus. What 1
suffered no tongue can tell. I had heavy, bear-
"Insr-down pains . and thought my back i would
kill me.' I also had a very bad drain, but after
taking five I bottles of * Favorite Prescription !
and three of â¢ Golden Medical Discovery, I am
feeling as well as ever.; It has been almost two
years and I have had' no return of the trouble.
My friends tell me I don't look as though I ever

CROWE DECLARES
HIS INNOCENCE
At the last convention held in Scran ton. Pa.,
P. H. McCarthy failed to get elected first vice
president of the brotherhood and on his return
to San Francisco began to lay plans to disrupt
the brotherhood ln this State. In January, 1901,
a committee of five was appointed by him to re
vise the constitution of the Building Trades
Council. Four out of the nve were known ene
mies of the International Brotherhood of Car
penters. The revised constitution submitted
was such as to abridge the rights guaranteed ' by
the Brotherhood of Carpenters. Article 2, sec
tion 3. reads as follows: - â¢
t "No 'union which holds : membership in any
central body or council foreign to the building
industry shall be eligible to membership in this
council, and any union which holds membership
in the Building Trades Council and which affil
iates with any central. body or council, not an
integral part of the building trades, shall, by
such affiliation - or action, forfeit its member
ship In this council, and shall stand suspended
without any further trial."
i When this constitution was pending before
the affiliated unions a committee appointed by
the president of the Building Trades - Council
visited every -union whjeh would admit them
and lobbied for its adoption, using the argu
ment that a vote against it was an act of dis
loyalty to the Building Trades Council. Many
of the unions ln the council are locals having no
national affiliation.' That fact and the argu
ment spoken of explains the apparent and large
vote given to said constitution. Carpenters'
Union No. 483, seeing the danger of -said con
stitution, voted unanimously against the same.
After No. 483. had been' . refused the working
card on October 1, - 1901, it appealed to the
general â¢ executive board of carpenters. â¢ Pend
inp such appeal the union withdrew its dele
gates from the Labor Council. The decision
of the executive .board of October 23 sustained
Union No. 483.' The decision was as follows:
"That no union- of the brotherhood could
subscribe to any laws of a Building Trades
Council that may conflict with the rights guar
anteed to its members by -its general constltu
tlOn> UNION WAS SUSPENDED. '
Upon ; receiving said, 'decision ] Union .No. ; 483
again sent delegates to the Labor Council, arid
was immediately suspended : by ; the Building
Trades Â¦ Council. >After the 1st" of January,.
1002, thÂ». Building. Trades. Council again re-'
fused No.' 483" ltd working card and began its
warfare against â¢ It. Â¦-Â» The. general president of
the Brotherhood . of Carpenters sent a represen
tative here -who succeeded ; in getting . the Dis
trict Council 'of Carpenters to agree to 'ask for
a rehearing of the case. At a meeting of tha
executive board in. January the former decision
of the board -was reaffirmed.. The " District
Council of Carpenters dominated by the.dele
gations from Union N.O. 22, composed almost
entirely of men holding positions ln the City
Hall, and from No. 423, the mill workers, re
fused to be governed by this decision and re
quested the* Building Trades Council to enforce
the working card. For its refusal to abide by
the decisions of the general executive board
the District Council was dissolved. Union No.
22 also refusing to obey the decision and strik
ing against members of the brotherhood, was
suspended and ordered^, to forward Its charter
and property to the general secretary-treasurer.
The laws of the organization provide that this
shall be done in cases of suspension. This
order No. 22 refused to obey, and is now il
legally holding the charter and money and
doing business as a union of the United Broth
erhood.'- When Union No. 483 was dropped
from the rolls of the Building Trades Council
Mr. McCarthy and his associates in the Car
penters' District Council, being in the majority,
passed a ' motion ' expelling No. 483 from, that
council. Two /years ago when the mlllmen
were on strike the Brotherhood of Carpenters,
in convention 'at | Scranton, Pa., donated $2000
to San Francisco locals to be paid in strike
benefits to members out ' of . work on account
of the buildings under construction-. being .tied
up for lack of mill material. This money was
not .used for that purpose, .but was Invested
by the District Council In Progressive Mill
stock, and when No. 4S3 was expelled from
'the District Council the remaining delegates
passed a motion to transfer 'the mill stock and
other property and funds, amounting to $2400,
to their attorney, Cleveland L. Dam. to pre
vent the brotherhood and No. 483 from obtain
ing their share of the same. This dishonorable
act. with, all ' others known to trickery, has
been practiced against No. 483. The general
executive board Instructed the loyal unions to
form a District Council, which was done. The
Building Trades Council took ' the . part -'of the
suspended union against the United Brother
hood and ordered, a -strike of the other trades
In the council ' against Â¦ all members of the
PLANS ABE EXPOSED.
. The new District . Council of th& United
Brotherhood of j Carpenters ahd "Joiners
met last night and issued a statement in
which President P. H. McCarthy of , the
Building Trades Council is charged: with
the responsibility for the present troubles
in which the carpenters' are involved."
McCarthy is accused of having exercised
a political pull to advance his own.inter
ests; that his opposition , to the brother
hood is, due' to the fallurelof his constitu
ents to elect him vice president of the
brotherhood at the Scr'anton convention,
and that he is looking after his own in
terests rather than those of. any organ
ization with which he has the honor to be
identified. -. .: . . . .
The statement of the District Council is
the first made since the opening of hos
titlities. It was decided to make the facts
public now that the. Labor Council assured
the District Council . of? the brotherhood
that it could rely upoYi' the central body
for help. The statement is as follows: \ :
Inasmuch as many' statements have been
made by the Building Trades Council and an
organization of carpenters of this city formerly
known as Local 22 of the Brotherhood of Car
penters, about the difficulty between the car
penters and the Building Trades Council, the
District Council of Carpenters representing: the
following localsâ 483, 10S2. 3M and 616â with
the support of . more than forty other 'locals of
the State, issues, the following statement in

THE " sudden, awful outburst

. , BATAVIA'S EXPERIENCE.
The gigantic eruption of ' Krakatoa,. In
the | straits of Sunda, between Java and
Sumatra, August 27, 1883, however, trans
cends in dynamic energy and fax-reaching
action anything ever â¢ recorded. " Situated
as It swas in the middle of theVgreatest
volcanic chain on the globe (ninety active
ones on Java and nearly as many on'Su
matra, with others. near), it seemed, as It
were, to ' vie with all predecessors In ter
riflc effort and results. Â¦ Â¦ ' . -
jjj The , outthrow of glowing rock, earth
and lava ' and - the rain of . fire and hot
ashes around Â¦ the sides of Vesuvius In
April, 1872, as drawn by artists and de
scribed by- writers' there present. for that
purpose fits well the 'stories told, by the
refugees from St. Pierre of the igno
dynamical phenomena exhibited by wicked
Pelee. .
As Vesuvius, after a repose* of untold
ages, broke forth and with tragical energy
resumed his reign of fire and awakened
the slumbering' echoes of his-power j with
terrible detonations and fearful quaklngs,
so ; Mont Pelee, after .a sleep of half a
century had blotted from, the minds of
the islanders all fear of evil,- with
like sudden and awful energy rose in his
strength and threw In mass and might
fire . and destruction on the doomed St.
Pierre and all the hamlets and plantations
for. far around.
The story of the ; overwhelming of Her
culaneum,. Pompeii and the whole Naples
and BeJae coasts has been too often and
too well told to need repetition here. One
is struck, however, by the close similarity
of the phenomena and action observed on
that momentous occasion,' as well as of
the outbreak of April 28, 1872, to the one
of Martinique.
PASSING OF POMPEII.
Not unlike the sight that the Suchet

smoke' of the country went up as the
smoke of a furnace." â¢ . ,
The destruction of Sodom and Gomor
rah and the other "cities of the plain"
was accomplished by . volcanic eruption
and earthquake combined. A district- of
several hundred square leagues in extent
was upheaved and a tract of like area
subsided, giving the river Jordan the
Dead Sea for its waters instead of tho
Red, to which It had before flowed.

SAN RAFAEL PROCEEDINGS.
At all events the legal squabble which
has thus commenced over, the dead man's
money before his remains are laid away,
in the grave gives promise of furnishing
much work for the courts, more for the
lawyers and | a world of trouble for the
aspiring litigants. -, â¢ . '- j â¢ J .
After considerable argument, which>was
indulged in by the attorneys on all sides
of ' the case. Judge Angellotti decided to
grant the Safe Deposit and Trust Com
pany special letters of administration over
the estate. This decision naturally enough
raises a question' as to which court has
the authority to direct the future uisposi
tiun of the caseâ the Supcriur, Court vt
San- Francisco or the Superior Court of
San Raiael. In the meantime the will of
the deceased is In .the' hands of the Title
and Trust Company, and as it can be stat
ed upon authority that Findlaysson did not
sign any documents . whatever , while he
was confined to his deathbed at the Hotel
Rafael it is quite probable that this testa
ment is the only one in existence. He was
never rational after he took to his bed at
the Hotel Rafael. Nobody who is inter
ested in the case seems to know what dis
position Findlayson made of his property.,
Â¦ Attorney A. . C. Barry and Countess In
gargolia were present at the hearing be
fore Judge Angellotti, but : neither Mr.
Barry nor the Countess took any part in
the proceedings. ' . ' â¢ x
â¢ The case, as it stands now, presents a
pretty tangle, and before It proceeds much
further the question : as to which court
has the authority to grant valid letters ot
administration must be settled.." *
Public Administrator John Farnum of
this city appeared before Superior Judge
Cook yesterday afternoon and applied for
special letters, of administration over

Happened on Worst Day.
Cable communication between the is
lands south of St. Lucia is interrupted,
but the fire" from the crater of La Souf
friere, island of St. Vincent, can be seen
from here, twenty-one miles away. In'
fact, the flame's, are visible, for forty
miles. ' i
It Is estimated now that fully 200 lives
have been lost on the island of ( St. Vin
cent. It is thought that when details are
received the loss of life will prove to be
much heavier. Kingstown, the- capital of
the island, is covered with ashes arid is
being bombarded- with stones from the
volcanic craters.' The terrific force of the
eruption at- St. Vincent may be Illustrated
by one incident. Ashes in great quantity
fell on the deck of the British steamship
Coya, Captain Eton, when she . was 250
miles away from the island..
No vessel can approach the northern
shore of the island on account of the In
tense heat and the steam which is coming
from all sides. ,'.
The British lieutenant in charge of the
garrison here reports that both large cra
ters on St. Vincent are emitting enormous
volumes of smoke, lava and hot ashes.
The] northern . J end of the island Is cut off
fromHhe southern end by an^enormoUB

Coroner Eden held an autopsy on Find

of death was attributed to be cerebral
hemorrhage and the doctors who refused
to sign a death certificate yesterday ap
pended their signatures to-day.
Manager James Brown of this Institu
tion testified to having received the let
ter and of knowing deceased intimately.
. After considerable discussion on the
part of counsel Judge Angellotti rendered
the decision that the trust company
should receive the special letters of ad
ministration.
A letter dated June 18, 1897, and signed
by James Findlayson was introduced in
evidence. In it he . stated that his last
will, made in March. 1897, was In box 1710
of the First Natiqnal Bank of San Fran

Colonel A. C. Barry testified that he
had been Intimately- acquainted with
Kindlayson for the last fourteen years,
that Findlayson died Friday at 1:25 p. m.
and that he was present at his demise.
He gave Findlayson's residence as San

estate amounted to, Barry said it would
approximate $200,000.

Historic among volcanic eruptions of
the Caribbee Islands wa3 that of Souf
frlere (sulphur pit) of St. Vincent in 1812.
Earthquakes had for two years i terrified
dwellers on the South American Coast
and West Indian Islands. In March of
that year an earthquake burled 10,000
souls at Caracas, spread ruin along the
line of the Andes and ended in the out
burst of Souffriere, which altered the ap
pearance of the island and destroyed its
estern end. Souffriere is situated at
the northern extremity of the Island and
Is 4048 feet high.. It is the last of a
mountain chain which was called Morne
Garou by the natives. Baron Humboldt
states that It had thrown out flames In
1718. â¢ . .
Among all the islands of the Caribbees,
St. Vincent is unique in natural wonders
and beauties. It is composed largely of
a single peak, rising from the \ ocean's
bed with no outlying Islets. It is about
ninety-flve miles west o'f Barbadoes.
Volcanic hills cross the island from north
to south. Intersected by beautiful and
fertile valleys. St. Vincent is eighteen
miles long and eleven miles wide and it
has a population of nearly 50,000 persons.
It was discovered by Columbus in 1498.
The island is more thoroughly English
than the two others of the group. Great
Britain obtained sovereignty in' 1873.
Then came two final explosions at
Krakatoa. The islands were lifted from
its foundation and hurled into the air.

order of the Treasury .Department on
charges of boodling, offensive partisan

Treasury Agents West >and Channing
have been instructed to begin the investi
gation immediately and forward their re
port to Washington.
Customs Collector Stratton has notified
Agents "West and Channing that. In his
opinion there is no necessity for a cus
toms collector at Eureka any more than
there is for one at Oakland. All the
work at Eureka, he says, can be done
Just as well and much more economically
by a deputy. The agents will therefore
recommend the abolition of the office.
WASHINGTON. May 10.â Governor
Taft to-day closed up his business here
in connection with affairs In the Philip
pines and left for Cincinnati, where he
will attend to some private business prior
to his departure from New York on the
17th . inst.. on his return to his post at
Manila. : He will stop at Rome In order
to discuss -the question of the friars in
the Philippines with the authorities at
the Vatican. He will be accompanied in
his mission to Rome 'by Judge James F.
Smith of the. Supreme .Court of the Phil
ippines and Major John B. Porter of the
Judge Advocate's\. ofHce. These _ gentle
men were selected because of their famil
iarity with the question at issue.
Secretary Root. this, afternoon made the
following official statement /in regard to
the mission at Rome: /
"It ha,s been decided that Governor
General Taft shall stop at Rome, in the'
course of his journey to Manila, for the
purpose of reaching, if possible, a friend
ly understanding with the authorities
having control of the disposition of the
property of the religious orders and other
church property in the Philippines, and
laying the basis for a settlement of thÂ©
many property questions which have ' re
sulted from the separation of church and
state in the islands. Â¦ Â¦ - .
"Of'course, nothing can actually be
done until Congress has acted, but as
the committees of both houses have act
ed favorably on the committee's recom
mendation for the purchase of the friar
lands, it is . thought best not to lose the
opportunity afforded by Governor. Taft's
presence in Europe to begin the negotia
tions and make as much progress as pos
sible, so that they may be readily closed
up after Congress has acted. If it does act
favorably. This is particularly desirable
because the mature of the questions is
such that it is impossible to settle them
by negotiation with the friars themselves
in the Philippines. The purchase of the
friar lands is the principal thing, and the
Government desires to accomplish this, if
Congress authorizes It, 'amicably,
y "There ar& many: other questions, how
ever, to be settled, \auch as the rights to
property held for purposes of Instruction
for charitable purposes, and ; the right of
the : church - to land, the title to which Is
now in the Government, but on which are
buildings for religious purposes. Some
of these : matters could be settled by
courts, but ! it Â¦; would < require' many years,
and It is very desirable to settle them in
a . speedy ; and friendly way.. . Prior to
American occupation the church and state
were so closely united and their Interests
so interwoven that now, when they are
separated; it is very difficult . to tell to
whom the property which was devoted to
their joint .uses under, tha former system
belongs. â¢ ' -, Â¦
"It is hoped that â¢. when a. full under
standing of the claims and views of each
side has - been Â¦ reached ', and the tacts are
fully understood all the Questions existing
can be settled in such a way as to benefit
both parties.' 1 '. The object of , this confer
ence Is to aectttft tb* saparatiott of church

EUREKA OFFICIAL
SUES FOR LIBEL
Litigation toÂ° Result
Prom Municipal
Scandal.
EUREKA, May 10.â Another sensation
lin the municipal wrangle was sprung to
day., Councilman A. C. Dauphlny com
menced an action for libel in' the Superior
Court against Councilman A. H. Buhne,
asking $25,000 damages for the injury
which he claims has been done to his
good name, fame and credit, by the af
fidavit made by Senator Thomas Selvage.
Buhne obtained " this affidavit for use in
the Council chambers while the sewer
pipe controversy was In progress, and,
not being allowed to read it there, it Is
claimed he had it published.
Dauphiny alleges in his complaint that
Buhne, "contriving and wickedly and ma
liciously intending to injure plaintiff In
his good name, fame and credit, and to
bring him into public infamy, scandal
and disgrace, and to cause it to be believ
ed by his acquaintances, neighbors and
the public generally that the plaintiff had
been and was guilty of corruption, and of
soliciting and accepting promised benefits
for the purpose of influencing his official
course as a member of the City Council
of the city of Eureka, did willfully and
maliciously compose, publish and cause
to be published a . false, malicious and
defamatory libel; and that by reason of
said false, maacious and aef amatory li
bel the plaintiff has oeen brought into
great public scandal, infamy and dis
grace, and greatly injured in his good
name, fame and credit, to his great dam
age and loss In the sum of $25,000."

SAN RAFAEL. May 10.â Attorney
Adolph Silva, ex-Mayor of Sausalito. tes
tified on the witness stand to-day in the
Superior Court of Marln County that he
was to have' received from the Fair estate
$40,000 for detective work and other, serv
ices rendered during Mrs*. Nettie R. Cra
ven's contest of the will of the late Sena
tor James G. Fair. Silva further swore
that he had received $24,000 of the amount
and that there was yet a balance of $16,000
due him. He claimed that the money was
paid to Joseph Harvey for him on April
26, 1SO0, and that on April 30, 1900, Harvey
showed him four certified checks of $10,000
each, which Harvey claimed were from
the Fair estate for Silva. This large sum
was due, Silva testified, for work done by
him prior to August, 1899.
This testimony was brought out during
the trial of the suit of Joseph Harvey vs.
Florence Silva and Adolph Sllva for the
recovery of a deed to a half interest in
the Sausalito Electric Light plant. Silva
went on the stand in his own behalf and
his sister, Miss Florence Silva, later added
her testimony to her brother's sensational
assertions. The entire day was taken up
by the examination of the two defendants.
SXLVA TEI-LS HIS STORY.
Adolph â¢ Sllva, after stating that he had
known Joseph Harvey since 1897, and that
he had been acquainted with Thomas J.
Frost, the half owner of the Sausalito
Electric Light plant, since 1890, testified
that Frost had informed him of a contro
versy in the company and wanted to ob
tain the money from him to buy the re
maining Interest. Continuing, Silva said:
I told Frost that I could not get the money;
that Harvey owed me. owing to the racetrack
war in San Francisco. Later as I could
not get my money, I told Harvey that I wanted
It or there would be trouble. He asked me not
to bother him. but that Tie would settle later.
On May 4. 1901, I went to Ban FVanclsco to
meet Harvey in the Peerless saloon, but he
was not there. I finally found him at a barber
shop on Ellis street getting shaved. He gave
me the $4000 certified check on Ellis street in
front of the barber shop and not in the Peer
less saloon, as stated by him. There was no
one present when he gave me the money â of
Q. â Did you tell Harvey. you would pay htm
in a few days? *>
A. â Xo, I never owed htm a cent in my life.
He owed me, sure.
Silva was put through a vigorous cross
examination by Attorney -James Coch
rane, and later by Attorney Lennon.
Many questions were asked as to his
birthplace, lineage and general history.
Finally the defendant's attorney objected
and was sustained by Judge Angellotti,
whereupon Attorney Lennon said:
"We nave a perfect right to know the
history of this man Sllva, your Honor."
"Now, Mr. Lennon," said Judge Angel
lottf, "I don't propose to allow you to en
ter into the genealogy of this witness.
You are not seeking information about
him, as you have It exhaustively before
you now," referring to the full transcript
of the testimony in the Fair-Craven
suit, which the plaintiff had procured.
"Well, your Honor, we wish to know
where this money came from," said Len
non.
GAVE MONEY TO SISTER.
Q. â Did you ever give Florence Sllva, your
sister, any money?
A. â Yes; on May 1, 1900, I gave Florle $12,
000.
Q.â Where did you get it?
A. â I jrot It from the safe 'deposit vault.
Q. â How came It there?
A. â Joe Harvey put $20,000 there for me in
April. 1900. The $12,000 was part of that
sum.
Q. â How did he happen to give you all this
money? Â«
A. â I had written him sharp letters stating
I wanted" what was due me from the Fair es
tate. He replied that his expenses had been
heavy; that his wife had been to Carlsbad and
he wanted me to wait. We agreed we would
not have a final accounting until after the
opening of the poolrooms that season.
Q. â How much' were you to receive?
A. â Harvey received on April 28. 1900. $40,
000 for me.
Q. â How do you know?
â A.-^-He showed me notes pretending to be
signed by Charles L. Fair for $10,000.
Q. â How do you know?
A. â He told me so. On April 30, 1900, he
showed me certified drafts of $10,000 each â
three or four of them.
Q. â Did Mr. Fair owe you anything?
A.â Legally, no. - â¢
Q. â Did you expect It?
A. â I expected It since the 17th or 18th of
April.
Q. â Why did you expect it?
A. â I had a talk with Fair in his office on
April 17 and at that time had an understand
ing with him.
SAYS HE WAS SENT FOB.
Q. â Who tpld you to go to see Mr. Fair?
A. â Harvey told me Fair wished to see me.
Harvey accompanied me to the office.
Q. â Was he present at the Interview?
A. â Of course not. Mr. Fair did not want
any one to know.
Q. â Well, for what* was this money owing
jeu?
A. â For detective work â services rendered up
to August, 1899, which I performed.
Q. â Did you ret or were you to have any
other money than the $40,000 from the Fair
estate?
â¢ A. â Oh, yes; I got some money for expenses.
Q. â You received $4000, you say, from* Mr,
Harvey.
A. â It Is not all I received. I was paid
$20,000 besides, $10,000 on the 30th of April
In the Safe Deposit building In coin, $20 pieces,
and $10,000 on May 1, 1900, In the forenoon, at
the same place.'
Q- â Mr. Sllva, up to the time of filing this
suit, did you tell any one about Harvey ow
ing you a balance?
A. â Yes,l told you, Mr. Cochrane, and I have
made statements that there was a whole 1 lot
of money coming to me from the Fair estate;
that Harvey had collected It.
Miss Florence Sllva was then called.
She gave much testimony bearing upon
the immediate issues in the electric light
deal. When asked where she grot the
money to purchase the Interest in the
electric light plant. Miss Sllva replied
that her brother, Adolph Sllva, gave It
to her.
"Miss Sllva. When did your brother give
you the money?" she was asked.
"In May. 1900, I received the money
from, my brother, after the Fair case.
He gave me $12,000. He Invested part of
it for me and $2000 of it I put in the Hi
bernia Bank." . .
The case will continue next week.

LOUISVILLE. Ky., May 10.â Walter N.
Haldeman, the venerable president of the
Louisville Courier-Journal Company and
one of the best known newspaper men in
the country, was struck by a trolley car
to-day while attempting to cross the
tracks and was seriously injured. He re
ceived a severe scalp wound and his
shoulder was sprained. Haldeman is over
Â£0 years old.
Trolley Car Injures Aged Man.
John Jones and Henry Thomas were
burned about the face and throat, and
the skin was burned off their fingers.
Hardly a man got out without some in
jury, and none saved any of their belong
ings.
As soon as the wrecked building fell and
tbe heat permitted, rescuers ventured in
and dragged the charred body of George
Rogers from his partly burned mattress.
Coroner Thomas Greene will hold an in
quest over Rogers' body in the morning.
Rogers was nearly 50 years old and had
no family. He must have been rendered
unconscious by the shock-
Richard Bastian, the proprietor of the
hotel, lived with his family in a house
some distance away. He can advance no
clew upon which the officers can work in
their belief that the explosions were the
work of criminals. He is a peaceable
man and cays he had no enemies. He
carried $2000 insurance.
Mark F. Adams groped In the smoke
Â£jid flame until almost suffocated, then
he broke Into George Rogers' room, burst
out the window sash and leaped to the
ground. The fall injured his back and he
lies In a state of paralysis. He gasped
that George Rogers still lay upon his
bed, but there was no means of reaching
the doomed man-
EOGEBS FAILS TO ESCAPE.
George Cann, with remarkable nerve,
hesitated long enough to dress himself
and got into the corridor, where he was
almost choked by the smoke. The fire
sot into his clothing and when he finally
reached the ground with both, his feet
burned hardly a etitch of clothing re
mained upon his body, and the flesh of
his back was cooked.
The force of the explosions was toward
the south wall, which was carried out,
else the immediate wreck would have
been more complete. Most of the miners
in the hotel were asleep. George Hammill
had lifted a lamp to extinguish it when
the concussion dashed the lamp against
the wall, starting- names in a fresh spot.
Hammill was stunned, but recovered in
time to get out with his underclothing
burning. His bare feet and his left hand
were burned, and he may be crippled for
life. Other miners were thrown out of
bed and in their excitement several were
so dazed that their companions had to
tarry to assist them. Fire was thrown
into all parts of the building by the ex
plosion and strangely enough the stair
way was ablaze in a second. The men
â¢who suffered the more serious injuries
were those who found this exit blocked
by flames when they reached it. They
dropped from, windows and escaped in
various ways.
The awful roar and shock caused con
sternation in both adjacent towns and at
the offices of the mining company. The
Bastian Hotel immediately broke into
flames, but tew dared approach to try to
help the inmates for fear of further ex
plosions.
FULE FOLLOWS EXPLOSION.
REDDING, May lO.-Two explosions of
dynamite, one following closely upon the
other, wrecked the Bastian Hotel in Sal
lee, one of the two towns near De la
Mar's Bully Hill mine last night. Within
fifteen minutes the building had burned
to the ground. It was occupied by miners
employed at Bully HilL George Rogers,
one of their number, perished In ; the
flames, and a dozen others were badly
burned or injured. While opinion is di
vided as to the cause or the explosions,
the more prevalent view is that the hotel
was deliberately blown up by some crim
inal having a grudge against the landlord
or some of his guests. Proprietor Richard
Bastian's belief is that some miner secret
ly stored dynamite In the basement of
the structure, and that the explosive was
accidentally touched off. He is loth to
believe that the destruction of his hotel
was the deliberate work of a criminal.
The hotel was a two-story frame build
ing and each of its twenty rooms was en
gaged by one or more men employed in
the mines. A third of them were at work
on the night Ehift when the disaster oc
curred. The first explosion came at 11
o'clock and the second followed in ten
seconds, as though time fuses of almost
equal length had* been set.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
General Belief Is That the Destruc
tion of the Building Was the
Revengeful Work of a Â£-v -

? The citizens of .the Hupeh city were
much excited because of the attack upon

They set siege to the city. According: to
some reports the city had fallen, its man

stores looted; but other report* received
in dispatches from Kaifengfu to Chinese
papers at' Shanghai were that the rebels
had divided their forces and were attack

protect the city in the event of the rioters
crossing the border. It was not expect

Hupeh, however, as they were practically
safe from ' Interference by Chang Chi

On April 11, while in New York, Mr. H.

$48,000 worth of men's. stylish spring and

there were but few concerns in this coun

quantity, especially on a cash basis, and
reckoning with, a knowledge of this ever

SINCE Princess Catherine Radziwill has been convicted .in South Africa of forgery and sen
tenced to two years' imprisorfment,' European correspondents have been -busy furnishing
the American people with accounts of her career and explanations of her crime. Of allthese
accounts that of De Blowitz/ the famous correspondent of the London Times, is at once
the most authoritative and jtlie most interesting. According to De Blowitz the.,Princess went to
her doom not, because she was 'infatuated with Rhodes, whose name she torged, but because she
believed him to be infatuated with her and she wished to save him and to help him.
. The Princess, who is a Pole by birth, has had a career that is a -melodrama. : In addition
to her high birth she has been honored as the possessor of the : grand cross of -the Bavarian order
of St. Therese. Her husband seems to be a worthless sort of man/ for it is said he has not only
dropped out of his wife's life, butout of social'- recognition as welL One of his brothers, how
ever, is an aide.de camp of the Kaiser and a knight of the Black Eagle. Thus both by birth and
by marriage the Princess has a hold upon the magnates of the -world and might have been ex
pected to get through it without going to prison. Unfortunately she was dowered with the fatal
gifts of beauty and of fascination^ and her life has been. tragic. r : .
Early in her career that brilliant Russian general and "diplomat/ Count Skobeleff, fell in love
with her and when she, rejected his advances he jj killed himself by poison in the midst of an orgy
he had arranged for that very purpose. , . The. fate of Skobeleff deeply irnpresse'd^ the Princess, and
when in after years Cecil Rhodes fell under her spell she feared he would become desperate like
Skobeleff and commit some mad act that would increase her remorse. She hastened to South
Africa to save him from that fate, but Rhodes had shaken off his infatuation and when " she ar
rived she found herself abandoned. Then'she plunged into all sorts of enterprises and soon be
came involved in debt. At first Rhodes helped her, but when she 'became more seriously entan
gled he refused to see her. Then came the forged notes and the ruin. X .
It is a ! chapter of history that beats romance, and there may be other chapters to come. The
Princess is not dead yet, and two : years in prison will not lessen her fascination, nor herdesire to
tell her side of the story : ; and '/.get some' strongf'man to "champion it. 'U '
FiROM the hither side of the t foot-.
r lights I have for two weeks' been
j religiously admiring the fine art of
Nat Goodwin and the beauty and
. art "of Maxine Elliott, his wife.
Much beyond her former accomplishment
has the charming actress achieved and
Is yet far from the end of her capacities.
I went to see her the other day at the
Actors' Home benefit 1 , with the steadfast
intention of avoiding the stereotyped com
pliments to her beauty with which every
person that comes within range deluges
her, but I had reckoned without my
hostess. Beautiful before the footlights,
she is dazzling behind, and before I knew
what Â¦ I was saying Miss Elliott had
smilingly exclaimed:
. "Don't be asinine!"
Then 6he began to tell me the trouble*
of the beautiful woman. , '_
"Beauty is a very nice thing to have
when your position is assured," she said,
quite frankly, "before, it is simply a
nuisance and a handicap on the stage.
It will gain you a hearing, true, and you
can always have a position as a-.clothes
horse, but outside of that, no!
"My first' part consisted of just six lines,
and because I was â remarkable, the
audience thought that I - should have
made much more of my opportunity. But
It was not in the play! The audience will
permit bad work, indifferent work, from
the insignificant-looking actress, but let
a woman beâ remarkable., and they im
mediately pounce upon her weaker efforts
as worthy of a particular and ! special
reprobation. Think if it is not so."
"But there is this kind of thing," and
I pointed to' the exquisite bouquet of
roses that Miss Elliott' was caressing, the
offering of a stage hand to the beautiful
woman- who spoke so disdainfully of her
gift of loveliness. .
"True," she -smiled. . -''But -..who is it
who comes to" the. top from the rank and
file? Not the beauty, not the woman who
has only her face to commend her. It is
the Duses, the ' Fiskes, the first case a
woman entirely independent of physical
charms. only thing that beauty does,
so far as, I see, is to thrust one into a
premature prominence, as I was thrust;
to make people expect of you more thÂ» - n
they, have the right to expect; or, what
is worse, to expect nothing; at all from
you. â¢ . -
"Then, when one makes -a little pro
gress, as one must, or retrograde, people
have a charming way of expressing sur
prise, as If one were not governed by the
same - laws that govern other students.
Hath not a beauty hands, eyes? "
"Yes, yes," I muttered; "eyes, indeed!"
and the Elliott eyes, large, liquid, and
probably gTay, flashed amused annoy
ance at the interruption. ; ' Â¦Â¦*:'~
â¢ "This is your last season with "When
We Were Twenty-One,' is it not?" I
asked.
"Yes," .said -Miss Elliott. "Next sea
sonâMr. > Goodwin and I will -play to
gether for another year, you knowâ we
shall have either another Esmond play,
or one by Haddon ' Chambers, or Miss
Ryley." â¢ :. ....
VHave you decided yet in what to make
your debut as a separate star?" '-.)'
"Not yet. However, < I may say that
Mr. Fitch. is writing a play; for me."
."Have you- no. Shakespearean- or Ibsen
aspirations?"; I -asked. -
' '.'No," confessed. Miss Elliott. "I like
to play in society comedy, . or anything
else that people like me in.".
;*Is it . really true that Mr. Goodwin
never suggests anything, in the way. of
.â¢business', to you in any of your perform
ances?'; , .-. -
"Quite true/! the lady said. "He does
nothing in any of -our scenesâ I wish he
would!" f$&83$Â£4&Â£t
"You &>. soon to London again; don't
your*. I asked. â¢ . .
: "Yes,", Miss Elliott said. "You know
people think it strange that we have our
home . there.' But , London is the only
place where we â¢ stay any, length of time
four months Â¦: in ; alL ' -We are ' traveling
here -the 'rest; of; the time, so wehave

"I have more unprinted than printed
;tuff," Mr. Well began after owning up
to the operas. "The larger things are,
firstly, not so much desired (from so un
important a person as I am), and, sec
ondly, one Is not anxious to let them go
until one is convinced that they are at
least as all right as one can make them.
And I am never too satisfied with my
stuff. There is a symphonic overture
given several times at the Crystal Palace
in London," by tjie.way, an oratorio, "The
Passion," several things for. chorus and
orchestra, a violin sonata arid much else
among the great unprinted, and there
probably they will 6tay.
VA man who does much teaching- finds
it Â¦ very hard to get the repose for com
position, and I am content to do smaller
things when iri the mood. Once In a'
while I fish out a little bunch and print.
â¢Then I may go on for several years andâ
except to do work for studyâ quite . for
get that 1 ever had the ambition to be
a composer. Truth to tell, I am more in
terested in the work of my pupils than in
my own attempts. What 1 have left of
.ambition is for them."
"What -of your own things do you pre
fer, Mr. Weil?" I asked. .
"Oh, I don't know. There are some
things for women's \'olces, one in canon
form, that I should have thought rather
good if some other fellow had done
them," he replied. (These, by the way,
are among the most delightful examples
of concerted work for female voices.)
"Possibly my most important work is
that for the use of children," he went
on, " the 'Six Sonatinas' I perhaps think
best of. I did three operettas for chil
dren with H. C. Bunner that 'were great
fun to do." (I filled in later this list of
children's literature that includes eleven
pianoforte pieces, op: 6 (Breitkopf and
Hartel); six vignettes (Ditson); twenty
four miniatures (Cranz, Hamburg); sev
eral sets of etudes and many songs. The
other piano work includes -perhaps fifty
pieces, the more important being Â¦ the
lovely "Ballade" in G minor, and the so
nata in F. The list counts also some
charming numbers among the "Valses,"
"Fantasiestucke," "Feuillettes," etc.
: "But, after all, we know you best here
by your songs," I suggested. "And, tell
me, don't you sometimes write your own
verse?" -. -
Mr. Weil smiled and admitted that he
did, occasionally. "I usually sign them
'from the Norwegian,' 'from the Basque,'
'from the Portuguese,' don't you know?"
Whereby' it will be seen that it is not
always the country's fault if prophets go
unhonored at horn.e. Â¦
The Well songs are many and beautiful
One of the most popular Nordica sang
here a short while ago. Possibly those
written to -the Goethe texts are best
known. They have a large vogue in Ger
many. Then there are the well-known
songs with violin obligato - (op. 10) five
German songs, another violin series later
and finer, and yet another set (op. 28)
The latest, just' in print (op 31, 32), com
prise three Shakespearean songs, ' ve"ry
characteristic, full and quaintly flavored
and three dainty modern Â¦ songs. There
are .to come also three trios for women's
voices and pianoforte (op: 33), three Eng
lish songs (op. 34) and six songs in canon
for women's voices (opr 35).
Besides these . things â¢ Mr. Well found
time, as I have learned from' other
sources, when he was a very young man
to study violin with David and' Lalo in
Pa T i^i, to Btud y the piano with Moscheles
and Plaidy: to kneel on a mat at Leipsic
with other fanatics to hear "Lohengrin."

"You know, Oakland has a fashion of

{ ( m NYTHING but myself." This
/\ was the highly characteris
r"\ tic but hardly encouraging
/ \ reply of Mr. Oscar Weil, to
â¢* request that he should
"talk" for me for these columns, and
my readers' edification-
It has long been my purpose to try to
make better known a few home people
to another few who would be the better
for knowing them, and as the Zeislers
and Hoffmans have taken off their illus
trious selves for a brief space, I Judged
this to be my opportunity. Naturally,
Mr. Weil, as at once the best and least
known man of music in town, suggested
himself as the most fitting subject for a
first sketch. But Mr. Weil thought other
wise â as 1 knew he would â and when I
asked if he would say something for the
paper he replied, with the delightful cor
diality of a man who will give you every
thing but the thing you want:
"Of course I willâ of anything but my
self."
Trusting to luck, I suggested the pres
ent standing of the divine art in Califor
nia as subject, ard the following day at
Mr. Well's house fcr a time. This pleas
ed, and the following afternoon found me
in the composer's workroom, with its
picturesque litter of half-finished scores,
choice books, and music-laden piano, not
forgetting the characteristic cigarette., all
disposed in the orderly disorder that is
the despair of housemaids and the de
light of genius. Everything proper to the
picture, in short, was there â but Mr.
Weil, and for a brief second I feared the
brave soldierâ for to his other accom
plishments Major Weil adds the art of
soldiery â had run away from the Inter
viewer. Not so, however. A little weary
from the day's teaching, he soon made
bis appearance end diplomatically propos
ed, as a pipe of peace was out of the
question, to make a pacific cup of tea.
The tea turned out to be as clever as
lnost of the things Mr. Weil does, and
with a Charles Lamb-like dissertation on
the virtues of the sacred leaf, a litUe ex
cursion into the art of Corotâ suggested
by a photographed wonder of the light
nr.d shimmer of a Corot landscape â and
the sketching of the future Well orches
tra, that Is to contain among other riches
sixteen tympani, the teacups were emp
tied, refilled, and filled again.
And the tea had its usual expansive
way. In a little while, under its genial
influence, Mr. Well had departed slightly
from his customary masterly reserve
about his work and the things - that are
his, and had confessed to severalÂ«beset
ting distinctions.
There are four operas to begin with,
three/ that have attained celebrity, one.
"Pyramus," an early and experimental
Â¦work and a comparative failure. "Pyg
malion," a dramatic work and a respect
ful perversion of Gilbert's play," as its
author phrases it, was a great success.
The comic opera, "Surette," written in
three weeks to supply a promised tenth
opera to the list of the Bostonlans on one
of their visits here, is one of the pret
tiest light operas on the stageâ not ac
cording to the composer, needless
to eay. "A War-Time Wedding," an
operatic melodrama, was also much of
a success during the palmy days of the
Bostonlans. The opera was withdrawn
with the secession of Jessie Bartlett Da
vis from the company, but will be revived
again next season, with the famous
contralto in her original role.

is but ,a matter of speculation more or less insecurely founded. vThere are 1 easons for believing that
the globe of the earth is. solid to its core. There are equally good reasons for believing that
within the interior iliere is a. mass of fiery liquid. '.Learned authprities . can; be cited, to sustain
either of those/views, but no.man- has .yet been sufficiently learned to, prove his theory with the
exactness of an indisputable demonstration. Â¦; ;
Among the most interesting speculations arid studies upon the subject are those which
seek to trace- a connection between the. mighty disturbances, that occur in the giant globe of the
sun and the earthquakes of our globed Careful observations extending over. ?. long period of time
have shown that .there is at least- a coincidence between astronomical and geological cataclysms. It
has been noted that when a magnetic' storm is in progress it often happens that there is a volcanic
eruption, that subterranean noises are, heard and that the grounH trembles violently over a wide
tract of country. It. is not,; however, the whirlwinds and eruptions of the sun only that coincide
with earthquakes and volcanoes, for recent researches^show that at certain. epochs the" moon, the
planets and even comets seem to stimulate .the activity of the subterranean forces, h
These coincidences have led many eminent men to hold that there is a. sea of fire within the
interior of the earth having a tide whose ebb and' flow are subject to the same sidereal influences
as the tides of the ocean; and when the influence of sun, moon and stars is greatest, the subterra
nean tide rnges in vast st'.irhis that shake the earth or break forth into volcanic eruptions and vent
their strength upon the air. Â¦ . ' . , v
Arnold Boscowitz of Paris, after an elaborate review of all the known facts and all the
learned theories -upon thfc subject; says in* his work on earthquakes and* volcanoes: "Universal and
all penetrating, dreadful and beneficent cause of life and death, heat is perhaps the most active
of .all the essential "principles 'of nature: This powerful agent has 'its home in the interior of the
earth, as we can test for ourselves by descending into a mine or looking down a volcano. I do
riot refer to a central fire, for I do not know whether such fire exists, 1 or .whether heat is. greater
at the center of the globe than in other parts, but what we can assert is that the effluvia of heat
do circulate in the interior of the ; planet. . * * * * We see torrents and flames of boiling lava
pouring forth from these depths, within which the rain and water which i filter through the crevices
of the' earth are instantaneously: "converted into vapor. * * . * But I also believe the celestial
bodies stimulate the subterranean forces/ and that the sidereal influences which descend from heaven
to earth penetrate into its depths.^ It would seem as if the moon especially must produce in the
fiery^matter of the abyss an agitation ..similar to that to which she gives birth on the ocean."
However ignorant man may be of the causes of volcanoes and of earthquakes he is not
ignorant of their awful powers and terrible effects;' .History abounds with instance after instance
of appalling calamities' caused by them. Since, the, day of the destruction of Pompeii down to this
latest cataclysm there have been a multitude of their fearful outbursts. Thai at Lisbon, which de
stroyed upward of 60,000 lives and wrecked one of the most solidly built 'capitals in Europe, was
the most destructive of property of which we have any clear record. It did i:ot, however, display
the most tremendous force. Among others that exceeded it was the eruption in the Straits of
Sunda, in 1 883, .which \ broke out first . from the vQlcano^of Krakatoa, continued until no less than
forty-five, craters in Java we're in full blast, and literally shattered and sunk mountains and islands.
The suddenness of the destruction constituted in some .instances . one of the most dread
features of the catastrophe. Within one minute the city of Mendoza, in the Argentine Republic,
was reduced to ruins and 16,000 people crushed to death. In twenty seconds nearly 17,000 per
,ished at Caracas. The earthquake at Riobamba in 1797 is estimated to have killed 120,000 in a few
minutes. The shock that destroyed. Lisbon lasted only five seconcjs, and the final catastrophe that
overwhelmed St. Pierre was not above three minutes in duration. .
Amid these shocks of earthquake and volcanic fires man has v played his part with a virtue
superior to the calamity that befell him. We are told that at St. Pierre, while the fiery rain
was descending and death impended over land and. sea, the captain of the French cruiser Suchet
held to his ppst in the port/ lowered his boats,, sent them through showers of boiling mud and
redhot sand to rescue the crews of wrecked ships and succeeded' in saving manyv Similar deeds
of heroism have occurred at every cataclysm of ; the kindj and the Roman sentinel who upon the
â¢excavation of Pompeii was found standing dead at his post is'but one of many heroes who have
met the dread disaster with an unflinching, firmness: Thus the outbursts of even these dread powers
of nature serve but to show that the human soul flourishes immortalâ "unhurt amidst the war of
elements; the wreck of matter and the crash of worlds." â¢- .

George J. Boardman, formerly of the
Twentieth Infantry, said he had never
witnessed but one instance of water cure.
He told how the natives would open, fire
on tbeÂ» Americans and conceal their guns
when~ the soldiers approached and claim
to be friendly. He also related : the cir
cumstances of . the murder . of a Filipino
boy by natives, because he was friendly
to the Americana. The witness also told
of the conduct of natives with guns, say-
Jng they would flre at the soldiers, and
that * when the latter , approached they
would , conceal their, weapons and greet
them pleasantly. Irr one instance of this
kind a Filipino party had been taken into
custody and the place of the concealment
of their guns was secured by taking the
men, one at a time, and firing oil a gun
after. threatening, them with death In the
hearing of the. entire party. None of them
were hurt, but the proceeding had the
effect of so frightening those left -behind
that a confession was secured. â¢-;Â¦.
- On the other hand the Senators objected
to the House provision imposing a consti
tution on the Philippines during a period
preceding independence. This . provision
also â¢ will â¢ be modified. In other respects
the joint Philippine bill will combine the
main features of the Democratic bills in
the Senate and House providing for ulti
mate Independence of the Philippines. The
new measure has not yet been drafted,
however, so that its details cannot be
given.
Private William J. Gibbs, Ninth Infan
try, continued his testimony before the
Pnilippine Committee to-day, giving ad
ditional details about the Salmgiga af
fair. He said he had never seen the water
cure administered, but had heard the
groans of victims. He heard of one death
as a result of the cure. Dirty water and
salt water were used for the cure, which
was generally administered by scouts.
Gibbs said the i'llipino women were very
virtuous. Filipino prisoners and the sick
were treated well, as were the peaceful
natives generally. The orders were to
treat them with kindness.
It was stated to-day by one of the con
ferees thatalthough the meetings are still
In progress a general understanding has
been reached on certain main features of
concession on each side.- The House
members objected to the Democratic
measure in the Senate,/ which provides for
a joint protectorate over the Philippines
by the United States, Great BritahvGer

treaty agreement for such protectorate
It Is understood that this provision will
be eliminated or much modified.
WASHINGTON, May 10.â As a result of
numerous conferences between Democrat

FRESNO, May 10.â The San Joaquin
Valley Commercial Association met to
day in Porterville. Arthur E. MIot, man
ager of the Los Anseles bureau of'in
formation, reported on the work done, in
that city In the past three months. A
discussion followed as to the advisability
of continuing to advertise in this manner
during the summer months. Several of
the representatives expressed the opinion
that if the expense in their counties could
be lessened for the present it would be
easier to get large subscriptions at the
beginning of the tourist season. -
James A. Barr of Stockton spoke of the
new promotion club organized in San
Francisco and of the work which It pro
posed to do. He suggested that an effort
be made to obtain from the club assist
ance in maintaining the Los' Angeles
agency. A committee of three, consisting
of Ben M. Maddox, C.. P. Brown' and W
N. Harris, was appointed to endeavor to
raise funds from outside sources for con
ducting the work. Barr's appointment as
a member of the promotion club was rat
ifled.

WELCOMED BY VETERANS!
Hanford was the scene of a- striking
demonstration. When the train rolled
into the station the people of Hanford and
the Grand Army veterans, with a. band,
were drawn up. on the platform. They
tendered an escort to the merchants and
marched with them to a grove, passing
through the business streets of Hanford.
In the grove Commander McCord of Mc-
Pherson Post of the . Grand Army ' called
the gathering to order. District Attorney
Rower. Irwin made 4 a speech, in which he
said to the San Franciscans: ' .
"Our interests are your interests and
your interests are ours. We want your
support." â¢. .'-...â¢ ; Â¦ .
F. J. Symmes spoke of the work which
San Francisco had undertaken. He also
referred to the Grand Army veterans -so
feelingly that he drew tears to the eyes
of some of them. Â¦ â¢ '
Hon. H/G. Casper said: "There is but
one United States and but one California.
The San Joaquin Valley is the heart of
California."
Andrea Sbarboro spoke of the promo
tion committee and its purposes.
Some laughter-, was caused when
Symmes, alluding to the tour, of the mer
chants, said, "We visited Visalia and in
spected the pavements." ' .
Philo L. Case, the drummer boy of Shi
loh, was called for and beat the roll. The
Grand Army veterans escorted the mer
chants to their : cars " and . the train de
parted amid cheers all along the line.
CLASP HANDS WITH FEESNO.
The climax of the day's festivities was
reached in Fresno, when Andrea Sbar
boro, in behalf of the- business men of
San Francisco, standing with outstretched
hand, clasping the right hand of Mayor
Stephens of' Fresno, while the businesg
men of the two cities vied with one an
other in noisy' approval of . the sentiment
and act; said:' '. . ' . :
"We extend to you the embrace of San
Francisco." - - , ' â¢ Â¦
The San Franciscans and Fresno busi
ness men had dined, -the former as guests
of the latter; . Mayor Stephens, j who was
introduced by President Neu. of the'Fres
no Chamber of Commerce, had told of the
realization - by Fresno of the community
of interest existing between San. Francis-,
co . and .Fresno, had pointed out, how
Fresno was becoming .the railroad center,
had described her resources and had men
tioned her seasonable and rosy anticipa
tions; the vocal strength of San Francisco
had : been exercised in songs and cheers
a nd interest had steadily grown keener.
Then, just as the dinner was about to
come to an end, Sbarboro had an Inspira
tion. He suited the crowd to a nicety.
The volume ot shouting increased and
continued some time. -Nice things .were
said by President Neu and Mayor Steph
ens about San Francisco.' | They hoped for
the greatness of. San Francisco and pre
dicted its .future. "
The San Franciscans were welcomed on
their arrival from Hanford by a - large

FLOWERS FOR EVERY ONE.
Early in the day every San Franciscan
was decked with flowers. Cary Fried
lander sported sweet peas, Charles Bund
schu had roses; Varney Gaskill was red
olent with orange blossoms; Ruf us Jen
nings had a garland on a sky-blue hat
that he picked up at Bakersfield, and the
combination made him look like a. flower
garden; Walter Castle carried a bunch
of roses as large as a cabbage; Sanford
Bennett had a branch of Porterville grape
fruit in tow: Albert ' Meyer sported
oranges on twigs; President Symmes of
the Merchants' Association reveled in
sweet peas.
This was the substance of his text to all
hearers. The people of the interior met
him and the delegation cordially and en
thusiastically, showing that they thor
oughly understood the situation.
"We of San Francisco desire to make
California known not only to the Eastern
States of our own country, but to the en
tire world."
FRESNO, May lO.r-This has been a
day of sight seeing: through the
San Juaauin Valley "^for the San
Francisco business men's party.
The start was made from Bakers
field on schedule time. During its trip
through the valley the special train
was laden with flowers and fruit and the
merchants feasted on oranges and grape
fruit and inhaled the sweet odors of
orange blossoms while they rode along
comfortably in view of the snowy, sum
mits of the high Sierra. Andrea Sbarboro,
the sire and spokesman for the San Fran
cisco party, was particularly happy in the
speeches, in which he conveyed to all
communities where stops were madeÂ» the
significance of the visit of the San Fran
ciscans. He dwelt upon the formation of
the promotion committee at San Francis
co and urged the people of the interior to
put themselves into constant communi
cation with that body. At Portervllle,
where the first stop was made, Sbarboro
said:

Beauty's Blood Deep
How untrue the old adage "Beauty's Skin Deep." How many women of beauti-
ful features marred by impure blood try in vain to get a pure complexion by doctor-

How many, many young women are anaemic, ; pale, sickly-looking, perhaps
with pimples on face and neck, owing to poor, - unhealthy blood. ' Perhaps wo-
manhood is approaching, that serious time of life when irregularities are liable
to break down a constitution. The first rule for purifying and enriching the,
blood is to keep the bowels free and natural, gently but positively, without ner-
vous shock, and Cascarets Candy Cathartic is the only medicine to do it.

CEREALS OR MEAT.
A Prepared Food Helps to Solve tTie
Â¦'.'' 'Problem of Good Living.
y
PRICES OF- -MEAT GO UP.
"Whilethe average housekeeper may be
ignorant as to whether a beef trust has
been formed or ' whether the increase in
the price of meat i8 due- to other causes,
if she is a woman: of moderate means she
has become convinced that she must turn
to something except' animal food for the !
main fare of her family,", says the Buf- ;
falo Express. .' : '\j>'-, Â¦-Â¦Â¦. Â¦ !- V j
."It is" not an entirely new thing, this
I advance in" the price of meats, and it is
even rumored that prices have not yet j
reached their limit,: but cer.tain, it Is that i
the cost of [living for- the average family '
has increased rapidly of .late, until meat
has become an, article of diet that must
necessarily .be eliminated from the dally
fare of the very poor and has become al- i
most -a ; luxury even to those who have aj
moderate and usually adequate amount to \
spend upon the family food. V |
'.'To-day domestic science and public !
opinion * have "joined In teaching an im- j
portant lesson to "rich and poor alike, the '
-cecesslty of - consuming body-building '
food, ; supplying, material "that will keep '
nerves, muscles, bones, flesh and brain, in !
the proper condition,^ feeding, into -the Â¦
j. human engine -the, fuel needed to make
I good the constant waste." J < l %
A food expert at Battle^ Creek, Mich.,
has produced ia v food especially intended
to supply more nutriment than meat, fish I
or, fowl, . and that costs the i consumer >
! about one cent a meal. : It is called I
"Grape-Nuts," and has more nourishment !
for the body and greater strength and !
vitality for the brain and nervous system,
arid is 'an economy that reduces the cost
of housekeeping ; to the \ minimum and at j
the same '- time pleases ; the Â¦ palate. j
Grape-Nuts is a condensed food, and â¢
about four teaspoonfuls with cream is \
sufficient for the- cereal part of a meal. ,
It , requires no ; cooking or , preparation of j
any kind, and, is ready for Immediate use '
and suited to the laborer, athlete, brain
worker, /epicure Â¦ and ; invalid. "
:; One pound of Grape-Nuts contains nioro
nourishmentâ that,- the . system : will absorb
-â than' ten pounds of meat. An experiment
' was',tried : by. a; man \ who ; found, that by
leaving^ off meat altogether at breakfast
andUunch : and taking in Its place four '
heaping teaspoonfuls of Grape-Nuts he !
began: to gain. flesh and strength.' and be- '
fore the full pound package was sone had
gained -f our : pounds . in weight, ; whereas he.
had been losing on his meat, diet. .
Â¦ ; Present conditions^ therefore, regarding
the price of meat are solved to the family
providerLby^ supplying Grape-Nuts to the
individuals^of her^ householdâ a food that
not " only - recommends * Itself -. by ; its econ-
omy and. pleasant taste,' but by its health- I
sustaining properties and jits ability to I

Among the passengers was a party of East
erners that left New Tork last May in the
eteajn yacht Margaret. They made' a tour of
the Orient and sent the yacht home- from
Japan. The party included I. E. Emerson of
Baltimore. Hiss Margaret Emerson. Mrs. E.

Among the other passengers were :
John Butler, an ex-eoldier, and J. Wynn. an
ex -United States sailor, were brought home on
the Peru to serve four years each at San
Quentin for burglarizing a Chinese pawnshop
during the occupation at Tientsin. They were
In charge of United States Marshal George J.
Derby, who turned over his charges yesterday
to the penitentiary authorities.
The Peru's cargo included $382,505 worth ol
opium and $223,240 worth of raw silk.
While the Peru was at Hongkong, A.
Marshall, the former steward of the Peru, who,
on the previous trip, fired a rifle bullet through
Captain Pillsbury' s coat, was tried, convicted
and sentenced to four years' Imprisonment.
The fact that Marshall was drunk when he
fired- the shot was not considered by the Brit
ish court as any mitigation of the offense.
Four years in a Hongkong prison is consid
ered about the same as ten years in San Quen
tin. Marshall was a hard drinker, a man of
nasty temper and his former shipmates have
little sympathy to waste over his present
plight.
The Pacific Mall steamship Peru, -which ar
rived from the Orient late Friday evening;.
brought a light cargo and about a hundred
passengers. The Peru inaugurated the â¢ched
ule of direct communication with Manila.' The
merchants of the Philippine port banqueted
Captain Pillsbury and drank toasts to the
health of the San Francisco merchants whose
efforts had established Manila as a port of
call for trans-Pacific liners.

As the crowd was, departing after the

In which three women and. a spirited
double team figured. That some one was
not hurt or probably killed was due to the
bravery of Police Officer J. B.- Murphy
and J. D. Fossati, who, at great risk to
themselves, stopped the frightened horses
atter they had ran for three-quarters of
a mile at top : speed. ;:Â¦ Â¦ Â« "
The team belonged to .Captain J.\ Jen
sen of 2225 Pacific avenue, Alameda. Cap
tain Jensen, with his wife and two other
ladies, was preparing to drive home after
witnessing the launching. The ladles were
seated* in the vehicle and Captain Jensen
was aboutto step in when the horses be-,
came alarmed at the tooting of whistles,
broke away from him and raced wildly up
Adeline street, threatening to overturn
the rig at ;. : every corner. Mrs. Jensen
vainly endeavored; to secure the reins,
which had fallen over, the dashboard. Of
ficer Murphy and < Fossatl '.were . near, the

' left the construction, ways at
the shipyard of W. A. Boole & Son, Oak
land, yesterday afternoon at ten minutes
after four o'clock. It is estimated that
1000 cheering people witnessed thÂ© launch
ing, which was a success in every. way.
Miss M. E. Hind, sister, of one j of the
owners of the Makaweli, \ christened the
vessel. Just as the handsome craft began
to move down the ways Miss Hind swung
a bottle "of California champagne against
the vessel's bow and the baptismal cere
mony was complete. As the Makaweli
struck the water the pawerful steam siren
in the Boole yards and the whistles of
steamers and tugs nearby sounded a sa
lute that continued for ten minutes. By
means of a hawser which had been at
tached to the bow of the Makaweli, and
which was paid out as the vessel glided
from the ways and into the estuary, the
momentum of the craft was checked and
she was then hauled back to the rigsrlng
wharf at the yards. â ,;,
Among those who stood around Miss
Hind on 1 the christening platform while
she was bestowing a name upon the new
boat were the following named:

Deputy District Attorney Bell, who per

mine yesterday, believes that there will
not be enough evidence to hold Fran
chintti and Pifferini for the crime. He
believes that, from what he has heard
and seen of the affair. Tavano is the
actual murderer. Sheriff Dunlap, Deputy
Sheriff Grauss and others believe that
Franchinetti is implicated in the killing.
The circulars sent out by the Sheriff
-jive the following description of the mur

Tavano went to the bunkhouse with his
companions, but could not rest. He then
went to Englehradt's quarters, got his
pistol and started for the hills In a north

was In danger, and attempted to eject
Franchinettl from the place. Tavano,
whose knife had been taken from him!
picked up a miner's candlestick and
joined in the fray. AH rolled through the
doorway out into the open. Pifferini says
he saw Tavano stab Englehardt several
times with 1 the sharp-pointed candlestick.
After this all left the scene, supposing
that Englehardt was not badly wounded
and went to their bunks. "Later one of
them returned and found their victim

CRAM'S SUPERIOR ATLAS,
STOCKTON, May 10.â The train, crop In. San
Joaquln'County this year will not.be so great
as .was estimated earlier In .the season.- Lack
of rain in. April lessened the chances for a big
wheat crop and the cold and unsettled weather
of- the past few. weeks has retarded the growth
of {barlev. ' . . . . â¢â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦..- ;.â¢-Â¦Â¦
The manufacture of wire cables, ' well
drilling ropes, furniture springs, etc., will
be gradually extended, r and the manufac
ture of wire and - wire products will Â¦ be
undertaken as fast as. conditions permit.
About 150 men are employed now, and it
is expected that the number will' be very
largely Increased when the new plant ia
in operation. - - -â
Two switch tracks will be run into the
factory J and warehouse from \Harrison
street by. the Southern Pacific
The site comprises five and three-quar
ter acres, and the trust paid the Mechan
ics' Institute $90,000 for It. Expenditure
for site and building will- probably reach
a quarter of a million dollars.
The plans for the new plant were drawn
up by W. P. Palmer of Cleveland, Ohio,
president of- the American Steel and Wire
Company: Chief Engineer F. H. Daniels
of the same corporation, whose home is
at Worcester, .Mass. ; George H. Ismon,
Pacifi Coast sales agent, and Henry M.
Brittan, superintendent of the plant,; at
the' time of Messrs. Palmer and Daniels'
visit to San Francisco earlv In March
The new plant will embrace the manu
facturing branch and an immense ware
house M all â¢ under one roof. The great
building will be but one story high on
account of the great weight of the mate
rials handled. But It will be most sub
stantially constructed, in modern mill
construction style, of brick and wood,
with heavy walls on concrete pier founda
tions, and with thick fire walls dividing
It into sections. It will be 520 feet long
on the Folsom-street front, 460 feet on
Fifteenth, 180 feet on Sixteenth and 130
feet on the Harrison-street side, the en
tire building taking the form of an L.
The Sixteenth-street end will be given
up to the immense warehouse, which will
be used for the storage of Eastern pro
ducts of the steels trust, as well i as for
the housing of the output of the San
Francisco works.
The plant at North Beach will be util
ized until the expiration of the lease,
March 1 of next year. It is the old Cali
fornia Wire Works plant, which . j was
taken over in 1S95 by the Washburn and
Moen Manufacturing Company, which, in
turn, was absorbed three years ago by
the American Stcel^arid Wire Company,
a New Jersey corporation. The latter
company .became a 1 part of the United
States Bteel Corporation a year ago.
The steel trust has begun work on the
new and greatly enlarged plant at Six
teenth and Folsom streets to take the
place of its North Beach property, In ac
cordance with the plans as announced
exclusively, in The Call a month ago.
Teams are busy filling in and grading
and workmen are putting in concrete
piers for the foundations, and in less
than a year the trust will be manufac
turing wire and twisting it into cables
on the site made familiar to J3an Fran
ciscans by the annual games in -which
Stanford and the University of California
have struggled on that* field for football
supremacy. "

1 in New Culvert at
Mayor .iSchmltt [ notified . the .Board : of

and was in imminent danger of going to
pieces. -The Mayor, 'who had also made
ay personal inspection of the culvert, found
that the masonry was cracking in various
places and bricks could be taken out by
the hand.; The Mayor notified the board
that if some remedy were not taken to
prevent further cracking of the masonry
the culvert would collapse and a loss of
$10,000 would fall on the city. Contractor
McDonald informed the Mayor that the
work was done according to plans and
specifications furnished by the Board of
Works, and on Investigation his Honor
found that the contractor had carried out
his part of the contract The Mayor be
lieves the plans were defective, and- orders
the board to locate the blame for the
trouble. "* -
The culvert cost $1500, and the remain
ing $8500. of the appropriation was utilized
to fill in the gulch. City Engineer Grun
sky filed a report on the subject on April
14 last saying that the culvert has been
under close observation eves since it was
known that the masonry showed cracks
resulting from the heavy weight of earth
and sand filling above it. The report out
lines the following remedy for the de
fects: .
The preferred plan of treatment would be
to line the structure with cast iron filling the
space between the cast iron and the masonry
with concrete. . The central section of the
structure for a distance of 100 feet should be
reinforced. The reinforcement should be of
such character as to enable the Inner rlns'of
to again assist In carrying: the load.
Whether this reinforcement must hereafter
be further extended than for 100 feet as now
.suggested may be left for future determina
tion. Various plans have been considered but
the only one which appears entirely satisfac
tory is one which involves an expenditure of

Coroner's Inquest held at Oat Hill
to-day over -the body of Charles
Engrlehardt, the jury late this af
Â¦ ternoon brought In a verdict
charging Antonio P. Tavano, Amadlo
Franchinettl and Bmllio Plfferinl with
murder. Tavano Is still : large, thougn
Sheriff Dunlap and a posse are hot on
his track. The Sheriff has offered $100
reward for his capture. The officers have
spent* the entire day in the mountains in
the. vicinity of Oat Hill in an effort to
locate the f usituve. Â¦ ,
Deputy Â¦ Sheriff Grauss of Calistoga
brought Franchinetti and Pifferinl to the
Napa jail to-day. Franchinettl will not
talk about the murder. Pifferinl asserts
that Englehardt and Tavano quarreled a
week ago at the 'mine,' but patched up
their differences. On Thursday night Ta
vano . was under the ? influence of liquor
and visited Franchinetti and Pifferini.
They told him to go to his bunkhouse
and get some sleep. The two men then
escorted Tavano over to Englehardt's
bunkhouse, Tavano having been stopping
with the German. Englehardt was there
with several other miners and was get

Additional comments by the _ leading news-
papers of San* Francisco upon the annoying
circumstances forced upon him by motives of
a rival. .
OPINION OF THE "POST."
The~Eveningr Post says that George Mayerle*s
methods have been copied. "George Mayerle,"
the Post observes, "by reason of his wide ad-
vertising, has built up a large business," which
the Interloping" firm next door, to him is en-
deavoring ' to - secure. : Â¦ .. 'Jg. . , .
Despite the attempts which' have. been made
to attract his ..business, '.George " Mayerle. the
German 'Expert .Optician, of 1071 Market street,
continues ; to" hold' his patrons, for Â¦ they, know
his scientific methods. ; Be .. not misled. Ke-"
member- the numberâ 1071 Market street, and
the full name, . George â¢: Mayerle, the German
Expert Optician. His trademark Is an eye with
a crown. . â¢ 'Â¦'.
The Wasp says: "The. attempt of another
person ojt the same name to capture the busi-
ness establish*! by George Mayerle, the well-
known optician at 1071 Market street, will
eventually do Mr. Mayerle more good than
harm. . It Is an old trick, and a discreditable
one, to try to steal a man's business, and It
never - succeeds. The newspapers^ should pro-
tect George Mayerle. He has been a liberal
advertiser, and conducted his business on rep-
utable lines, and . now. when he begins to reap
the benefit of his hard work, another person
claiming . the same name opens an office next
door, to get the benefits of his advertising,,
and appropriate his patronage. The interloper
appears to be doing no business at all, and it
would be an outrage if he did."
Be not misled, look for the full name, George
Mayerle, also an eye with . a crown on every
window, and remember the entrance. 1071.

With a view toward conserving the
right of the public to free passage and
usÂ« of the sidewalks of this city, without
unduly harassing certain commercial pur
suits, the Board of Public Works yester
day sent a communication to Chief of
Police Wlttman requesting that official
to enforce the ordinances relating to ob
structions upon sidewalks and streets.'
After referring to a conference on the
subject held on April 16, at which were
present Mtyor Schmitz, members of the,
.Merchants' Association and the Commis
sioners of Public Works, the communica
tion says: , 4
"A Judicious enforcement, of the or

PREDICTS DEFEAT

In regard to our legislative ticket, the people
of Humboldt County are /i-ery friendly to Sena

favorable to him wnl be elected to the Assem

The fight between Campbell and his hench
raÂ»n and the . independent Republicans will be
to the finish. Â¦ I do' not underestimate the
strength' of such an organization as Camobell
has built up. They have control of most of the
offices of the county and most. of the patronage
in Eureka. But I believe the people are so far
aroused now that they will not allow Campheli
to control the State delegation or to name
county officers. Â¦;â¢ - . . : -; .'Â¦... .
On general principles I do not believe that thp
President and his Cabinet will tolerate in any
officer political interference , or bosslsm -' Mr
Roosevelt had enough experience with ring poli
tics when. he was trying to purify the govern!
ment of New .York City to detest that sort 'of
thing and to put his foot on It whenever he
can. ' Â¦ . Â¦Â¦Â¦ â¢ Â¦ Â¦Â¦ \ . â¢ , - - -\ Â¦ -Â¦
You say action has been begun, against Buhne
for libel on account of his charges against
Campbell. I do not know that all these charges
are true, but if half are true Mr. Campbell is
unfit to hold the office he now 'occupies R The
majority of the people believe Senator 'Selvage'
told the truth In his affidavit, and If the libel
suit Is begun as a bluff it will not work, for
Buhne and Selvage are thoroughly in earnest
Selvage is a hard fighter, and being in the n~ht
he will not weigh his chances for the Congres
sional nomination as worth very much In com
parison to success In his struggle to put Camn
bell out of power.' ' : . . ... v Â¦
As a rule we have had good officers. Good
men have even been friendly. to the grang, .not
wanting to incur its enmity, and haj'e been
dictated to by the ring entirely too frequently.
But if It appears that the charges made by
Councilman . Buhne against Collector of the
Port Campbell are true, and that. other rumors
âand there are plenty of themâ are well
founded, there are enough honest Republicans
in Humboldt . County to strip : Campbell of his
horors and his power. .; Â¦â¢ 'Â¦' :â¢Â¦â¢'*.Â¦
It is commonly understood that Campbell and
his associates have -' a slate prepared, with a

Since leaving New York Governor Odell
has visited Charleston, /where. he partici
pated In the New York day ceremonies at
the big exposition. From there he jour
neyed to Atlanta and thence to : New
Orleans. His party then went direct to
Los Angeles and visited Santa Barbara,
next going to Monterey. He stated that
he intended going back to Monterey and
might visit the Yosemlte before depart

his party will return to Albany by way
of the Canadian Pacific Railroad.
"I have absolutely declined all Invita
tions sent me by the citizens of the vari
ous cities through which I have journeyed
because of a lack off time. I did, however,
agree to meet and did meet informally
the members of the Chamber of Com
merce of Los Angeles. I shook hands
with a great many gentlemen and ad
dressed a few remarks to them. The In
vitations you speak of have been received,
but as yet I have not accepted any or
them. Whether I will do so remains to
be seen. 1 doubt whether I will break
my rule, however. Mr. Harrlman, who
is an old friend of* mine, has invited mo
to a dinner and I think that will be the
only function I will attend. I am op

Governor Odell left Albany, N. T., on
April 23, and expects to return to thÂ»
capital the first week in June. This is

"If the question were a new one in this
State there might : be much- force in , the
argument; that,;. where .the law ., requires
approval of; a. n official bond, the officer's
right- to actually occupy his office . does
not arise until *his bond /has been -ap
proved by the proper Â¦ official. But the
same point : arose Â¦ in ; People > vs. â¢ Fitch l
Cal.', 5iiO, ; and the Supreme: Court; despite
the refusal â¢; of > the. Governor 'to act upon
the ' bond :. tendered him ;<by y the ; relator
held 'Â« that' 'the relatori was! properly, elect
ed," and i en titled to exercise the | rights and
duties of the office.' The case was; cited
; '/Secondâ It is objected,- further, that
McComb's right to occupy the office is not
complete because his bond has not been
approved by the Mayor and the Auditor
It is oonceded Â¦ that he tendered a : bond,
proper in" form and with, sufficient sure
ties, to the officials named, and that they
refused to act on the ; same in any .way.
In other, words, the appointee , flid
everything within his power to qual
ify, -but , was prevented from fully
complying with the ; law by the re
fusal of other, officials to take the'ac
tion required of them. ;.

"Ah ordinance Is the form in which
the/ legislative -acts of the city and
county are to be cast, section 6, supra.
and the natural inference is that acts
which V are not legislative in - their
character need not be passed by
dinance, and shall not be subject to
the veto -power. An election or ap
pointment to office is riot an . exercise
of legislative power, , and therefore
becomes complete upon the passage
of the resolution of appointment.* It
is to . be remembered . that the veto

and ; not extended by application.

"To my mind, the words last quoted
clearly imply that v the bills or resolu
tions which require^the approval; of
the : Mayor j are . such bills or resolu
tions as, when approved, become or
dinances. . .
"Section 16 that 'every bill and every
resolution as hereinbefore provided which
shall have passed the board and shall
have been duly authenticated shall be pre
sentedâto the Mayor for his approval

and it shall then become an ordinance.' .
REFERS TO CHARTER.
"Under article II, chapter 1, section 1
of the charter 'the- legislative power of
the city and county of San Francisco
shall.be vested in. â¢ â¢.. â¢ the Board of
Supervisors.' Section 6 of the same chap
ter provides that every legislative act of
the city and county shall be by ordinance,
and that no ordinance shall be passed
except by bill; section 13 that every bill
or resolution providing for certain speci
fied - matters not here involved shall be
published for : a certain length : of time,
etc. . -Â¦.:Â¦Â¦Â¦
' "First, it is contended that his appoint
ment by the Supervisors was necessary
because the resolution appointing him did
not receive the approval of the Mayor.
The position of the defendant is that un
der the charter every act that can possi
bly be performed by the Board of Super
visors is subject to the Mayor's power to
veto. Assuming that, under the rule de
clared in Eisehhuth vs." ,Ackerson, 105
Cal., .97, the, power conferred on the Su
pervisors by' the Code of Civil Procedure.
(67) is to be exercised in the mode desig
nated by the charter, let us examine the
provisions ;of the latter instrument re
garding the Mayor's power over acts of
the Board, of Supervisors.
"But it Is urged that, assuming the pro
visions of this section to be controlling;
McComb's claim of -incumbency is defec
tive In two particulars. Â¦
. SPEAKS OF MAYOR'S POWER.
"Although this form ' of .proceeding Is
not designed to . determine, i as between
conflicting claimants; the .title to an of
fice, yet the relief here gought will be
granted to ones who has* a clear prima
facie title. Such prima facie title can,
under the decision in Quinn vs. Baehr,
rest only in one who, like McComb,
claims to have been elected and to have
qualified under the provisions of -section
66 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Â¦
"This court- has- already, in Quinn
vs. Baehr, decided that the provisions
of the charter relating to the appoint
ment of \ a Justices' Clerk* are void,
end it follows* therefore: that Fred-/
rick's claim is entirely '-without right.
"The petitioner, McComb, claiming to
be the Incumbent of the office of Justices'
Clerk in and for the city and county of
San Francisco, has brought this proceed
ing under section 1015 of the Political
Code for the purpose of obtaining an or
der requiring ttte defendant, Fredrick, to
deliver to the petitioner the books and
papers pertaining to v such : office of Jus
tices' Clerk. . McComb asserts a title to
the office based on nomination by tho
Justices of the Peace, followed by an ap
pointment by. the. Supervisors. . Fredrick,
on the other hand, relies upon an appoint
ment by the. Mayor made under the sup
posed authority of the charter of the city
and county:. of San Francisco. ;
' CITES - QTJINN CASE.
The case was argued for several days
before Judge Sldss, point after point being
offered by the attorneys for the rival
clerks. It was submitted on . April 19.
Judge Sloss' opinion, which is very con
cise and covers all the points offered by
the attorneys, is as follows:
The decision is. the result of summary
proceedings taken by ', Leon Samuels, at
torney, for McComb, to. oust Fredrick,
there being a desire to avoid the use of
force to get control of .the office. The
question of who, is Justices' Clerk is now
settled for the present, but an appeal. will
be taken to the Supreme Court by Fred
rick. .-..â¢-..
Superior Judge M. C. Sloss decided yes
terday that the claim of 'Powel Fredrick,
the Mayor's appointee to the office - of
Justices' Clerk; is_ entirely without right,
and issued an border directing Fredrick to
turn the books and papers of the office
over to George *> McComb, who was ap
pointed Clerk by the. Justices. and whose
appointment was subsequently confirmed
by the Board of Supervisors. '

was handed to the clerk by Bethea, and
the clerk stamped it and entered it in

junction based upon the allegations in
the bill will be made in the United States

' The defendants, it is alleged, control
about 60 per cent of the total volume of
the livestock trade. In violation of the
provisions of "An act to pfotect trade and
commerce against unlawful restraints and
monopolies," and in order to restrain com
petition among themselves, they have, It
is alleged, dlfocted their agents at tho
various stockyards to refrain from bid
ding against each other, except perfunc
torily and without good faith. In fur
ther violation of the act, it is alleged that
they have engaged in. and intend to con
tinue, an unlawful combination and con
spiracy among themselves for bidding up,
through their agents, the prices of live-,
stock for a few days at a time, so that
the market reports w^ill sliow prices much
higher than the state of trade will.war
rant, thereby inducing owners to simulta
neously make largo shipments and by
reason of resulting large offerings the de
fendants obtain. livestock at prices much
less than it would bring in tho regular
way of trade. ,. . â¢
The bill charges further that, in viola
tion of the act of Congress, the defend
ants have made and imposed' arbitrarily
uniform charges for cartage for delivery
when no such- charges have been custom
ary in the trade, or would be made but
for* the combination and' conspiracy,
thereby increasing these charges for
meats to dealers and consumers; that
they have made arrangements and agree
ments with officers and agents of common
carriers to receive by means of rebates
and other devices unlawful rates for
transportation, and have thus monop
olized, and unless restrained will continue
to monopolize the commerce in. livestock
and fresh meats. .
President Mitchell and committeemen of
the three, districts held ; a meeting this
morning, but nothing was made public as
to their deliberations. The committeemen
left for their homes this afternoon. Pres
ident Â¦ Mitchell is still here attending to
his correspondence. He will leave - for
Hazleton Tuesday afternoon. The works
have laid off nearly all their coal crews,
and efforts will be made to run the wash
ers to supply coal for locomotives.
This is the semi-monthly pay day at all
the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western
mines in the Lackawanna Valley. The
Delaware and Hudson paid oft on Thurs
day and others of the big companies will
disburse many thousands of dollars to
their employes within the next half week,
so with what tho mine workers have been
laying aside in preparation for the strug
gle with the operators this winter, feelipg
that a strike was imminent, they are riot
so poorly provided for as .has been ' re
ported. â¢ '. Â¦
There is a strong sentiment among the
miners in this district ! that President
Mitchell is opposed to a strike, and that,
no matter how the operators may view Â«t,
the. mine workers' union can afford to re
fuse to engage In the conflict which they
say tho operators are inviting.' On the
Saturday preceding the Monday on which
the 1900 strike order took place the. mine
bosses worked < among their personal
friends in the ranks of the miners to urge
them against obeying the strike order.
To-day the bosses arc religiously holding
aloof from their men. There is absolutely
no effort on the part of the operators, so
far as is apparent here, to discourage a
strike. This, coupled with the fact that
the rank and tile are firmly convinced
that -National President,, Mitchell is
against a strike, will have a strong, in
fluence toward an anti-strike vote at the
meetings tobe held Monday afternoon.
That the order to suspend work Monday
Â¦will be followed by the mine workers is
already an assured fact, for so eager are
the men in this region to follow their
loaders that this morning found a number
of mines so handicapped by. workmen re
maining away that the force on hand was
too snr;all for- prontable work and they
closed down for the day. |

Old Pete Lohman was the last man to
register a run. In the eighth he drove out
a double to center field ari* Brick Dev
ereaux followed with one of the same
brand to right, which put Peter safely
over the jumps. Oakland had several
more chances to add to its list of tallies,
but the base-hit was lacking to do tha
work.
Oakland started in early. In the second
Devereaux walked and scored on consecu
tive hits by Francks and Gorton. Moskt
man opened the lifth with, a hot drive to
center field, took second on Walters' sin
gle past first and crossed the pan when
iittle Mohler drove a hot one far out to
left field.
Jones was on the slab for the southern
ers, and he was hit hard whenever Ew
ing's crowd was In need of a run. Both
Infields worked snappily, but nothing of
the sensational ordgr occurred to disturb
the quiet of the bleachers.
Dr. Moskiman rounded Into his old-time
form yesterday afternoon at Recreation
Park. He sent the Angels to the tall tim
bers v.ithout any runs and only five scat

nine innings. The Angels were badly
fooled and did not have as much chance
as a snowball in the torrid zone. The
game was well played, Hannlvan's error

STTMMABY OF EVENTS.
Yale's loss of the hundred yards' dash
was a surprise, as Abadie was not ex
pected to beat either Moulton or. Har
grave. Captain Cadogan, who was not
in good condition, pressed Hargrave
closely in the 22u-yard dash," finishing a
strong second. ' \ \
The half-mile race was well run, Kane
taking the lead for three laps, with Ser
vice of California following his pace
slowly. Deming of Yale kept himself well
in hand until the turn of the last lap,
when he passed his competitors, winning
from Kane by a narrow margin and from
Service by n'fteen feet.- The wind was
blowing directly against the men on the
spurt and the time, 2:5494, was good.
In the mile race Teal of Yale and Rede
well of California ran a dead, heat and
rather *tha'n make them ruii Â¦ it oft the
judges declared that one-half point
should count for each team. It /was a
close and Â¦well run race under adverse
weather conditions. In none of the
events were the men able to do them
selves justice for a cold, chilling breeze
blew from the northwest across the tteld.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., May io!â Th.e
dual track athletic meet held to-day on
Yale field between Yale and California
universities resulted in the score:. Yale,
8 5-6 points; California, 4 1-6 points. By
agreement only the winners scored. In.
the track events the Yale track athletes
were superior, but in the field events the
advantage was partly with the j visitors,
because of the skill of Flaw, who. cap
tured the shotput and hammer throw
easily. Sprakcr was not entered for Yale
in the high or broad jumps. In the high
jump the two Californians tied with the
Yale competitor and the point was di
vided, two-thirds going to California. - .

A tour of the bay' was made, and at
Vallejo all hands were, given leave for an
hour ashore, when ;Dr. Joseph; Stelnau
was hitched to a llght k buggy, in which
was seated W. F. Peterson of Sacramen

proved a willing steed. 5 ' â¢ â¢ . Â» Â¦Â¦
"The Jo vials" were then taken 4 across
to Mare Island and- at once became nau
tical and breezy. jThey saluted. Uncle
Sam's brave boys *with the regulation
"Aye, aye, sir!" and to emphasize their
sympathy with the navy performed a
sailor terpsichorean act that was at once
"Jiggy" and inspiriting-.
After an inspectio'n of the navy yard
had been ofllcially made by "The Jovials"
the trip aboard the stanch General Fris*,
bio was resumed. An impromptu concert
was interrupted by an incident that
caused consternation. The windt blowing
with high velocity, had lifted the shin
ing and much admired silk hat from.
"Doc" Stelnau's head, and but for the
fortunate presence of a quick-footed deck
hand would have been lost in tho bay
or blown into the city hours before thft
arrival of its owner. "Doc" has promised
the hat to the United Commercial Trav
elers as a souvenir.

, The name Itch King rightfully belongs to Eczema, for no other disease can ap^aroach
it in the intensity and fierceness of its itching. It is an irresistible and overpowering itch,
unlike that produced by any other disease, or from any other cause. Eczema's itch is torture,
and, at times, so distracting that the sufferer scratches till the skin is broken, and streaked
with blood; Scratching does harm, of course, but the eczema patient is deaf to reason and
reckless of consequences when the itching begins.
Eczema is caused by a too acid blood and the retention in the system of nratic and
other waste matters' which the proper organs have failed to remove, and, through tbe circula-
tion, these irritating poisons are carried to the surface of the body^ producing inflammation

The men searched the yard, however,
and found the man cowering under a
woodpile. McSorley tried to arrest him.
but he resisted, and with the assistance
'.I his wue made a warm time of it for
the officer. In the midst of the fight
Weiss broke away and attacked Dr. Ker
gan, but tlie doctor was too quick for
him. He tripped the man and then, fall
ing upon him, put the officer's handcuffs
on his wrists. Afterward Weiss was taken
tc the Receiving Hospital, where several
wounds on his head were dressed, and
later he was assigned to a cell in the City
Prison.
Mrs. Weiss' daughter complained to the
neighbors that her stepfather beat her
Â¦with a piece of hose. The wife excuses
him on the ground that he was intoxi
cated.
Dr. Kcrgan's attention was directed to
the Weiss home at 1 o'clock this morning
while he was returning from a night Call.
The neighbors cried out that Fritz Weiss
vras killing his wife's child and the
screams of the girl could be heard calling
for help.
Officer McSorley heard the screaming,
too, and rushed to see what was the trou
ble. Upon being denied admittance to the
house the officer and physician went to
the rear. There Mrs. Weiss told them
her husband had escaped over a back
fence.

In an endeavor to protect an 8-year-old
child from a beating at the hands of her
stepfather. Dr. W. W. Kergan and Police
man McSorley were treated to a clawing
this morning by Mrs. Fritz Weiss of 717
Sixth street, wife of the man who was
venting his anger on her daughter. So
furious was the woman's attack that it
was necessary for the police officer to
turn Weiss over to Dr. Kergan while he
etiuggled with her. She fought and
kicked and pinched like a demon until
finally subautd.
Brown was charged with manslaughter,
but was released on his own recognizance
by Police Judge Smith. The child's, father
ls a section boss, employed by the South
ern Pacific Company. /
My car was running at ordinary speed along:
Grove street, about 5 o'clock. At Twenty-sixth
street I saw children playing In the street. Just
as the car approached them the child that was
killed ran out directly In front of the car. I
reversed the motors aÂ» quickly as I could, but
it was too late to save the child, who was
struck on the head and killed.
That the little body was not badly
mangled under the car wheels was due
to the promptness with which the motor
man stopped his car. Although a life
was lost. Brown did his utmost to pre
ventl the accident. He was overcome
with grief as he assisted to move the
baby's body.
As soon as he had completed his run,
Motorman Brown surrendered himself at
the City Prison to Captain of Police W.
F. Petersen, to whom he made the fol
lowing statement:
The accident- occurred at 5 o'clock. The
baby, with other children older than her
sell, had been running about the streets,
her mother bcinc absent on a call several
blocks from their home, which overlooks
the scene of the fatality. Just as the car
rolled along, in charge of Motorman A.
U Brown, the baby ran directly in front
of it. She was hit on the ' head and
tumbled over. Passing pedestrians picked
the little one up and 'soon had the baby
in her home. The mother was notified by
children, who saw her approaching the
house. Mrs. Shannon fell fainting from
the shock and was cared for by neigh
bors. When she -evived she was assisted
home, only to tind her baby girl a corpse.
Dr. H. J. Lackey, who was in tne
neighborhood, was summoned, but he
could only tell the distracted mother that
her child was dead.
While playing in the street this after
n< on, little Margaret Shannon, not quite
three years of age, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Robert Shannon, resting at 5'j6
Sycamore street, was struck by a south
bound Grove-street electric car at Twen

was favored by the last production of the

experiences on the stage have been of
great profit to them.
The size of the audience was particu

1400. and the 1800 available seats were
practically filled when the performance
began. . Society from San Francisco, Oak

was well represented and many pilgrim

Heart weakness, aggravated by the ex
traction of her teeth, ls declared by a
Coroner's Jury to-night to have been the
cause of the death of Mme. Maria Teresa
Astorga de Pereira, who died In a dentist's
chair Thursday afternoon. The Jury's
verdict does not blame Dr. Q. I* Schmidt,
who was treating Mme. Pereira at the
time of her death.
At the Inquest this evening Miss Marl*
Pereira, the deceased's daughter, first re
lated the events leading up to her moth
er's demise. She said Dr. Schmidt gave
her mother brandy to stimulate her be
fore he began the extraction of twelve
of her teeth. The dentist extracted three
teeth and as she seemed to be weak ha
had given her a powder. Soon after that
Mme. Pereira fainted and the daughter,
becoming freightened, sought assistance.
She was not present when the physicians
tried in vain to resuscitate her mother.
Dr. Schmidt testified that whila Mme.
Pereira's health might be good she did
not seem altogether robust. He advised
her against anaesthetics and she consent
ed to receive an injection of cocaine Into
her gums. The dose, the dentist said,
contained one-sixteenth of a grain, which
is a minimum amount. After two teeth
had been extracted Mme. Pereira com
plained of falntness and the dentist gave
her a powder of yucatan to stimulate her.
Following the extraction of a third tooth,
she fainted and he summoned assistance
when It became evident that she was
very ill.
Drs. S. C. Hornef, W. H. Goldson and
O. C. Hyde all testified as to the efforts
they made to revive Mme. Pereira. They
thought there was once a sign of return
ing life in the deceased, but this was only
momentary.
Dr. Hyde, who performed tne autopsy,
testified that he believed death to be due
to heart failure and the shock from the
extraction of the deceased's teeth. He
based his opinion on a microscopic ex
amination of the heart muscles, which
he found degenerative. In accordance
with this statement the Jury rendered the
following verdict:
"We, the Jury, do find that death was
caused primarily by shock resulting from
extraction of the teeth, and secondarily,
to weakness of the heart, due to degenera
tion thereof." â¢
The Jury was composed of Cnarles Jux
gens. E. H. "Warren, D. "W. Morris. J. R.
Nalsbltt, J. H. Fairchild and C. Warren.
The funeral of the late Madame
Pereira was held this afternoon at 2
o'clock from the Pereira residence, 9O.
Madison street. The services were
conducted by the Rev. Dr. Mor
rison of the clergy of the Church of the
Immaculate Conception. The honorary
pallbearers were selected from the consu
lar corps of San Francisco, as follows:
Consul Calderon of Honduras, Consul
Tinoco of Costa Rica, Consul Grau or

Stopped by Unknown
West Berkeley Resident Has
Exciting Experience With
Miscreant.
BERKELEY, May 10.â Mrs. A. Dalziel
of Bancroft way and Third street. West
Berkeley, was viciously attacked twice
last evening by an unknown man. But
for the timely appearance of passers-by
she does not know to what extent the
assault would have been carried.
Mrs. Dalziel was on her way home from
the residence of Mrs. M. Unda on San
Pablo avenue at about 10 o'clock when
the man sprang upon her from the shadow
of a building at trie corner of Eighth and
Addlson streets. He seized her by the
arm and commanded her to be still, but
the brave woman fought against him with
all her strength. Her son Clyde, an 11
year-old boy, was with her, but he was
too frightened to be of assistance. Her
screams attracted a man in a buggy, who
drove up and the assailant fled.
Mrs. Dalziel's unknown rescuer drove
on and when the woman and her son were
nearly home a second attack was made.
Mrs. Dalziel. tore away from her attacker
and fled to a group of men at Sixth and
Bancroft way. Although a search was
made no trace of the man was found.
Mrs. Dalziel believes that she would know
him If she saw him again. She thinks
robbery was the motive of his attack.

day. To-morrow night the League of the
Cross in full uniform will be present. The
companies will hold a competitive drill
and the one showing the most proficiency
will be given a handsome trophy. 'The
league's band will furnish music. .
The Irish dance hall, which' has been
moved from the gaiiery down, to the
ground floor, again proved its great pop
ularity last night. During the entire
evening this part of the great festival
was crowded with spectators watching
the graceful dancers executing the lively
and picturesque jigs. Irish jigs have ever
held a warm spot in the public's heart,
and now that an opportunity is afforded
to see them performed In due style and
all correctness, the people are taking ad
vantage of It.
When one enters the fair one is at a
loss to know just what feature to visit
first, as suchi a number of inviting spec
tacles present themselves to one's sight.
As a rule, however, the bewildered visi
tor is given very little time to consider.
He is very soon taken in charge by some
of the pretty Irish lassies and whisked
away to view the attractions at the
booths. These, indeed, present a very
beautiful sight, and last night in the ab
sence of a regular programme the ladies
In charge of them reaped rich harvests.
Yesterday afternoon the fair was open
especially ,for the school children and
hundreds of the little people â¢ nocked to
the pavilion. Punch anu Judy, Imported
directly from Cork, and the merry-go
round and the museum with its freaks
proved especially attractive.
Although there was no special - pro
gramme under the auspices of
any ~ particular, booth last night at the
Irish Fair, Mechanics', â¢ was
crowded and the attendance far exceed
ed that of any previous evening. The peo
ple found abundance of enjoyment in
viewing the 'map of Ireland and locating
their particular city or county on its ver
dant surface, or in visiting the art gal
lery, with its collection of rare paintings,
or the booths and viewing the displays of
wonderful and beautiful articles, z

WHY DRUCS FAIL-Many Men Treated for Weakness Which
Never Existedâ Failure Due to Wrong Diagnosis.
There is a tendency nowaday* to accribe cases of lost vitality to lack of nerve
force and to treat them as such, with tonics, electricity and stimulants, resulting: In
but the most temporary benefit. If at all.
As a result of observations and practical experience. I have been convinced that
the nerves play but a subsidiary role in the production of disorders of men. It is
very unueuaJ to find any trouble in an otherwise strong man other than a datraged
prost&U or deep urethral Inflammation, particularly in those whose disorders origi-
nated in too lone continued and too often repeated excitement, or the harmful influ-
ence exercised by an ill-treated contracted disorder, and if exhausted nerve force
seemed to be present, it U only aa a concomitant, or perhaps we may say a compli-
cation of chronic prostatitlg. and disappeared with its cure. Still further, these
lacta are verified by purely local treatment, for procedures directed toward repairing
tne aasiasred gland are always rewarded by the most brilliant cures.-

Auditor Baehr decided yesterday not to
pay any more demands for fees of jurors
in criminal cases, as the fund "for that
purpose is exhausted. Baehr has now in
his possession demands for $3186 90 un
paid, and says that the fund will be over
drawn by $5500 by the end of this fiscal
year. Baehr recently requested the Su
pervisors to pay the demands for actual
services out of the urgent necessity fund
but no action has as yet been taken. *
W. H. Cobb, the Auditor's attorney
rendered an opinion that the right of
Jurors who are summoned and attend
court, but are not impanelled In a case
to claim fees is at least doubtful, because
a man Is not a juror until sworn to try
a case. Furthermore the appropriation
made was for actual service only, and the
Auditor was advised not to audit de
mands of those who have not actually
eerved on*a jury. J

The annual membership fee has been
fixed at Jo for each member, which will
entitle such member to vote at all meet
ings of the" members and receive copies
of bulletins, reports, notices of .entertain
ments and other publications that may
be issued by the society. . ,
The officers.,and members of the board
of directors are as follows:
The society at present is in its infancy,
and for the first year will proceed quietly
along a given path, with a definite pro
gramme in the one or more selected
school districts.
It is also hoped to found in the district
in which the Columbia Park Boys' Club
and the new playground are located a
psychological laboratory and the nucleus
of a scientific library.
The society, proposes to co-operate with
the Columbia Park Boys' Club, which has
done In the past so much for the young
men of this city, In strengthening and
expanding its work and establishing new
clubs in other -localities under one man
agement.
Among the improvements contem
plated will be the establishment of a
night training school for extension work
and the organization of a society or fra
ternity tor the education, training and
expanding of the social life of boys" club
graduates and other older working boys
and young men, so that those who have
in their turn a desire to take up the in
telligent leadership of boys may be prop
erly trained and equipped; the establisn
ment of kindergartens in connection with
the Fchools under competent instructors;
out-of-door vacation schools, with coun
try excursion and nature study; school
auditoriums for the use of the pupils and
the public; free lectures, such as those
conducted in New York, and the opening
of the schools after school hours as . a
neighborhood guild center; for free con
certs and other entertainments.
The object of â¢ the society is to give
force and direction in this city to an in
ternational school extension movement.
The purposes of the society are | not
new, as the school extension movement
has already- been started in this city,
although under another name, and has
done excellent work In the opening of the
new children's playground at Seventh and
Harrison streets and the work now being
conducted by the head worker and the
physical director of the .Columbia Park
Boys' Club at the Franklin Grammar
School. . /
A, few San Franciscans have recently
got together and started a society, to be

VEW YORK. Slay 10.â Tho effect of the
rrrlke order of the anthracite mice workers
eeemed to kill speculative Interest in the stock
oarket to-day. â¢ Price* went lower, in some
caces notably so, but the volume of liquida
tion was trivial and rather lees in the coalers
than in eozne other department! of the list.
There were come large individual selling or
ders in Union Pacific, Et. Paul and a number
of other prominent stocks In which a specu
lative party has been active recently, seem
ingly on the assumption that dividend increases
w*re to be looked for In those stocks. The
unexpectedly poor showing by the banks had
much the same effect on stocks, .causing strag
gling declines on light selling. The opinion
was heard that the anthracite operators prefer
a Etrike at this time, if one Is Inevitable,
rather than to have it come In the fall. The
strike is not taken very gravely even now, as
is shown by the effect on the stocks of the
coal-carrying roads. The loes or over $0,000,000
in cash reser\-es, "compared with estimates
based on the knowa movements of currency
&K reported by the banks themselves of about
$2,000,000. is rather vaguely attributed to "lo
cal movements." The loan contraction of
?2.224,r>00 showed but a meager result of the
ttock market liquidation. There is nothing to
Bhow how far the much-discussed position of
the trust companies may have been altered for
the better by the week'e events.
Thie wetk'p stock market started off in the
ihroes cf anxiety caused by the suspension of
three Stock Exchange houses and the collapse
of the Webb-Meyer securities, which had been
inflated by a vigorous process of manipulation
find speculative buying on credit. The string
ency in the money, market had the Inevitable
'â¢ffect of calling In loans and Inducing dis
iKmination against this clasB of collateral
WSXb credits curtailed the manipulators found"
themselves unable to support their stocks and
ih* forced liquidation caused an utter col
lajr-e. As the event proved the general mar
to stood up remarkably well under Â«he t.hock
with the result that sentiment was greatly re- i
toured end con3<Jence ' in the soundness of thÂ»
rc-dtion cf the market became more general
than for some time past. The episode has been

Saturday .the demand was more brisk. The

this description was dull. Changes in other
vegetables were slight.
What Is probably the last shipment of Onions
from Oregon arrived on the steamer yesterday
Two hundred and' seventy sacks were^ received'
but no sales were reported. Outside of a lim
ited demand for shipping there was- very little
movement in Australian, as the new- red are
usedto fill the local demand.
There was no change in old Potatoes. Sup
plies of river Burbanks were light and prices
were sustained. The Oregon steamer arrived
with about 5000 sacks, but there was very little
business done on the wharf. Seed Burbanks of
desirable size .were reported steady, but small
stock was not wanted. . .â¢ .

Washington Crop Bulletin.
The report of G. N. Salisbury, section direc
tor United States Weather Bureau, for the
WeEhlagton crop bulletin, week ended May 6,
Is as follows:
"The week was too cool, wet and cloudy
for rapid growth of vegetation, but the abund
ant moisture In the soil, resulting from the
copious ehowers, will probably prove beneficial
to all crop* In the end. The temperature was
about three degrees below normal on every day
except the last two, which were warm, eun
ebiny and rrobably most conducive to growth
of any days yet this season. In the western
eectioa there â¢were copious. showers on all but
the l*st two days of the week, while over
much, of Uis eastern section the total rainfall
was about half an Inch.
"Hot much trosress has been reported for
wheat, and some fields are eaid to look sickly,
but there la yet no room for discouragement
cs long zs there is abundant rain. There
have been no frosts severe enough to damage
fruit blossoms during the week, and the pros
pect reraains very favorable for the fruit crop.
"Plowing, oa.t sowing, potato planting and
general gardening have been much interrupted
end delayed by rainy weather. Some early
potatoes are up, but are not growing much.
The season is an unusually backward one."

! control or Indifference to the market fluctua
tions in the price. This may be either in the
confidence that the ultimate value of the prop
erty may justify present extravagant prices
or In the realization that the marketing of
Urge holdings would break . the price. The
email floating supply makes such stocks quickly
responsive to a small demand or to manipula
tion, which is practiced in such stocks for the
sentimental effect upon the general market.
Such stocks are, however, equally sensitive to
light liquidation. There are many stocks in
the present market whiph are supposed to be
at price levels thus attained. - The fact has
been often pointed out of late that the volume
of credits in the country is greatly expanded
and feeling on this point was made additionally
sensitive by the action of the Clearing-house
authorities last week In resolving that outside
institutions admitted in future to Clearing
house privileges must make weekly reports for
publication of their condition and must main
tain cash reserves in their own vaults equal
! to those required of Clearing-house members.
This was obviously an admonition that the lo
cal trust companies should maintain cash re
serves against the very large collateral loans
which they have out. Instead, of relying upon
their cash deposits with the banks, which fig
ure as cash reserves there also. The nervous
i&ss on Monday was thus accounted for. There
was extensive calling for loans and throwing
out of doubtful collateral. The money rate
went to 20 per cent on Monday and 16 per cent
on Wednesday. There was much uncertainty
as to the extent of the troubles. The Monday
market demonstrated, in fact, that there was
ample reserve still back of the market and the
liquidation was well taken at all points. The
consequence was a rather violent recovery on
Tuesday and a return of calmness and firm
ness afterward. The shifting uncertainties of
the anthracite labor situation were an Influence
all the week and opposing opinions as to , the
chances of a strike were strongly held all the
week. The difficulty of arriving- at a fixed
view of the outlook had the ultimate effect of
discouraging speculative activity and throwing
the market into dullness and neglect. General
conditions were regarded as favorable. The
grain market reflected Increased confidence In a
favorable outcome for the year's crops. THe
point was made that the drouth In New York
to winter wheat had come so early. as to give
ample time for replanting of corn and other
crops as a possible offset to "the losses in
curred. The continued pressure for deliveries
of all grades of Iron and steel products was re
garded as evidence of the health of that in
dustry, but the iron and eteel stocks on the
Stock Exchange â¢ were not favorably affected.
Conditions are reported to be Improved In the
copper trade and railroad earnings continue to
reflect a high degree of prosperity, notwith
standing the small grain movement. The
week's liquidation In stocks has sensibly re
lieved the money situation and the higher rate
has attracted credits from Interior domestic
sources and from foreign money markets. The
reply filed by the Northern Securities Company
tc the Government's suit had a favorable effect,
as the contentions made are regarded as strong
ones.
The bond market has moved In sympathy
with stocks over a much narrower range.
United States 3s and the new 4s declined
*i per cent, as compared -with the closing call
of last week.'

Provisions.
Chicago was lower on the day. The packers
were bullish on small receipts of Hogs and light
packing. The cash demand was fair. There
was some realizing by local longs. The weekly
letter of Bolton. De Ruyter & Co. said :
"Market is easier, 7%@12% lower. There
was a rather strong opening, but it was met
by profit-taking sales by local holders and the
closing was rather soft. Receipts of hogs were
35,000. against 33,000 last year. Some increases
in movement seems generally expected in the
near future. Cash demand continues moder
ately fair."
This market remains as already stated, some
dealers selling at the top and others at the bot

CHICAGO. May 10.â Wheat showed good
strength all through the sessicn. - Unseasonably
cold- weather Northwest with rains in many
sections and snows reported in the Red River
Valley, firm cables, small receipts and pros
pects of a fair decline In the Government crop
report started prices higher at the opening.
Shorts covered freely but the principal factor
w.as the absence of selling -pressure, which
showed a marked change in the sentiment of
the pit. Commission - houses bought Â¦ to some
extent, but in the main the pit was verj 1 quiet,
waiting for the Government report, which had
teen delayed. There was a fair cash business
and shipping trade and July, which opened
%o to %@%e up at .74%@75o, sold to 75%c.
Minneapolis reported such a - scarcity In i the
Northwest that Interior- millers were buying
stuff to take back to their mills. All told,
the tone of the pit was more bullish, largely be
cause of the weather, which Is . much too wet
for further spring seeding. Late liquidation
took off some of the gain, but July closed firm,
%S'%c higher at 75%@75%c.
Corn was firm during the course of its rather
dull trading. July closed %c up at 61%c.
A good cash demand and a scarcity ofioffer
ings developed a better tone and a fair trade
in oats. July closed firm %o up at 37c. K
Provisions lost much of the strength that
marked yesterday's strong, market. Locals
liquidated liberally and the outslda also sold
to come extent. July pork closed 12%c down,
lard 7%c lower, and ribs 10c down.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Weekly bank' clearings gain, as usual.
Silver lower and pointing downward. Exchange unchanged.
Local stocks and b'onds dull. Oil stocks more active.
Wheat and Barley still quiet., â¢
Oats and Corn firm. Rye neglected.
Hay weak and Feedstuff s firm?
Fair coast demand for Beans. Eastern demand all filled.
Butter, Cheese and Eggs unchangedi
Nothing new in Dried Fruits. /
Hides firm, with an active inquiry.
Meat market as previously quoted.
Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables unchanged.
Poultry and Game quiet and featureless.
Strawberries and Cherries in larger and Oranges in smaller supply.

The Financier this week says : The official
statement of the New York Associated Banks
last week showed a loss of $6,011,500 in cash.
In the previous week the banks gained $1,433.
700. Hence there was a net loss . In the . fort
night of $4,577,800. The estimates of cash
changes, tlsed upon the traceable movements
of money .last- week, indicated a loss by the
banks of $2,027,600, 'while the- estimates for
the previous week showed- a- loss of $2,071,800,
making for the fortnight a total estlmhted
1ob3 of $4,629,400, which amount closely ebr
reepends with the actual net loss for the fort
night shown by the official statement. The
loans decreased last week $2,224,500. reflecting
the liquidation which resulted from the call
ing in of loans by banks in consequence of
the unsettled monetary conditions. The de
posits were decreased $7,954,000, and consider
ing the fact that cash was reduced by within
$1,942,500 of this amount, It would appear
that the loss of cash was largely responsible
for the diminution in deposits. The decrease
of loans and cash together amounted to $8.
236,000, or only $282,000 greater than the re
duction in deposits; the statement in this re
spect, therefore. Is harmonious. The required
reserve was reduced $1,988,500, which amount,
deducted from the decrease of cash, leaves
$4,023,000 as the loss in surplus reserve This
item now stands at $3,461,000, against $8127 -
475 on the corresponding date last year, in
which week it will be remembered the May
panic occurred. It 1b expected that there will
this week be large receipts by the banks of
moner resulting from the payment to New
York merchants of maturing obligations. Com
parisons of changes by individual banks show
that seven downtown institutions decreased
loans by $1,000,000 net. The changes in specie
by the seven banks indicated a net loss of
54,500.000. The bank clearings for the week
were about $1,000,000,000 less than the pre
vious week. . .

"Market showed some strength early on cov

however, toward the close. No change in con

of large holders speculative operations are on
a small scale and featureless."

THE STOCK OF THB " Â«
INYO GOLD COMPANY
Â¦ Is -a -Â¦ .
. SPLENDID INVESTMENT,
For the following good and sufficient reasons:
-1. It has a MINE with fifteen thousand tons
of gold ore blocked out Jn the north incline,
going $12 60 per ton. The south Incline is un-
der a still larger and richer body of ore. the
full size of which has not yet been, ascertained.
Several experts agree that the ; measured ore
bodies will yield over two hundred thousand
dollars.^ All this is on only one of the seven
claims. The remaining \ six make equally as
good surface showlngH. . . - --*
2. The owners have shown their good faith
in the expenditure of $115,000 in doing over
1400 feet of development work, erecting a
twelve-stamp mill, etc. â¢ . .
3. Mill runs have cleared $25,000 on the
plates, the, bullion being mostly handled by
the Central Bank of Los Angeles, which lta
president. Mr. William Mead, . will verify.
4. The tailings from these runs contain over
$15,000, which can be cyanlded.
5. The company is an Arizona corporation,
making the . stock absolutely, non-assessable
and exempting the private property from lia-
bility for corporate debts. , ' - - Â¦ " . ' â¢
6. A limited block of stock Is being sold for
further development and to install cyanide and
electric power . plants, which will "greatly re-
duce the cost of milling. . "\ .
. 7. The sterling Integrity of the directors of
the corporation is beyond - all question. I Ask
any banker. Government official or commercial
agency in Los Angeles. Their probity, honesty
and . business ability are unquestioned. The
character of the mine and company invite the
fullest confidence of the public. Prospectus

the market. HUNTER'S new lever rupture

to cure 75 per cent with our treatment. Also
a new combined rupture holder and abdom-

The Chicago Company, an unknown, so far
as any one here is aware, is paying dividends
to stockholders from sales of oil developed in
Kern County. Its stock Is selling at, $100 a
share. No company of that name is producing
*. fc=.rrel here.
.The Bakersfleld Californian reports that
a company composed of Hawafians will
operate in the Temblor district. The Cali
fornian also has the. following:
The April shipments from the Kern
River field amounted to 2970 carloads. The
McKittrick district shipped about ten
carloads per day. These figures indicate
that the reduced rate by rail on oil thac
has just gone into effect amounts to a
handsome consideration to the shippers
who have large contracts. The averaga
saving per carload as compared with the
former rate from the Kern River dis
trict is about $7 50.
The boiler house of the Pacific Coast
Oil Refinery Company at Point Richmond
has been finished and ten boilers are In
place. The machine shop is also com
pleted and the Installation of machinery
is 'proceeding, with due speed. A dozen
large buildings indicate the size of the
plant. Work has begun on. the pumping
stations.
The project of an electric line from Ba
kerefield to Ventura is still favored in the
southern country. The distance is about
115 miles. The cost is estimated at about
$10,000 per mile. This line, once construct
ed, would also furnish transportation for
several important otl districts. All of
these schemes are in the formative stage,
but there are large producers who are
concerned and hope for something more
tangible in the next few months.
The Redding Searchlight tells of the
sale in one day recently of 200,000 shares
of the stock of the Keswick Oil Com
pany. The stock was disposed of at a
delinquent sale and was bought in by the
company for the amount of the assess
ment and costs. A few stockholders paid
the assessment, which was 1 cent per
share, but the great majority refused to
pay and let their stock go." The directors
hope yet to be able to continue to drill on
the well at Sand Flat.
The most interesting news from the oil
fields relates to the plans of the producers
to find an outlet for the product. First,
of course, is the Standard Oil Company
pipe line, but there are other projects
that are at least mooted. Principal amons
these is the one entertained by the com
panies in the Sunset district whose prop
erty is north of the existing railway lino.
An agreement is reported to have been
entered' into by the Arcola, Monarch, Oc
cidental, Maricopa, Obispo and Tremont
companies to assist in the building of a
railroad to the center of section 2. The
distance is only about two and one-half
miles. All .things considered, the rail line
is preferred to a pipe line for the same
distance. The advantage of the proposed
railway over a possible pipe line Is its
ability to convey all kinds of merchandise
and other freights as well as the oil to be
moved.

has announced a miscellaneous auction of
more than usual interest. The catalogue
contains: .
There . were ITS building contracts recorded
for April amounting to the- unusually large
figure $l,4-'i8,5&9 28. The hleh price of ma
terials has kept these figures be^v what they
otherwise would have beÂ«n.
A month ago The Circular stated that the
demand for rtal estate was the best we have
had for eleven years. Purlng March -BOO sales
were made at the total price of $3.6Â«8,ol3.
April has exceeded March with total salts of
610," ef the value of $5,32D,010.- The eales for
the month of April not only represent the
highest amount ot money ever invested in this
city for one month, but they exceed by $607,
737 Â¦ any other month since this city was
founded. The next highest record was made
in March, 1860, when W14 sales were made
aggregating $4,72t t 273. The market for in
vestment Is strong in the retail and wholesale
sections, with no sign whatever of abatement.
In the inside retail section there arc numerous
buyers, but sellers are very scarce. The result
has. been that high prices are offered and more
often refused than accepted. The outer West
ern Addition and the Mission are- beginning to
move,' but at low prices only. Outside lands
and the homesteads are absolutely quiet. This
record of sales was made In the best business
sections, buyers preferring to pay premiums
for the best rather than anticipate values more
than two or three blocks from established busi
ness centers.

dealer, seta forth the following interest
ing statement in his monthly circular:
A prominent real estate dealer of this
