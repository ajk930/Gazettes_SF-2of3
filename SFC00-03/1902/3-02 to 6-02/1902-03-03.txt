: committee had erected a platform at a
point outside the car shed of the Tenth
street station 1 of the Louisville and Nash
ville Railroad, and . when the train
stopped a gang plank was put from the
steps of the latst car but one to the plat

about six feet-and the gang plank became*
wedged between the sides of the -vestibule
entrance to the Pullman car and the sup
ports of the platform. The gang plank
was half demolished and the vestibule
door was torn off the car.

guard of mounted police, took carriage
for a short drive through the city. He

a silver bound album, the gift of the-citi
zens of the city. The outer cover of tho
album bore a finely executed relief model
in silver, showing the battlefields. The

MANILA,. March 2.â While, Governor

ing Fellzardo and his band of ladronea
over the hills of Cavite Province, Fellz
ardo, at the head of twenty- ttve men
armed with rifles, entered 'the town of

the Presidente . of Calnta, Benor Ampll,
and a majority of 'the police of tho town.
' Benor AmpU'has long been known â¢ as
an enthusiastic American sympathizer
and it is feared that he may be killed by
the enraged ladrones. A strong force of
constabulary has been sent to effect his
release.
The ceremonies concluded at 7:30 t>. m.
with the sinprinpr of a specially composed
cantata by M. Charpentier and the play-
Ing of the "Marseillaise."
The Hotel de Ville, the Place des Vosges
and the neighboring thoroughfares are il
luminated to-night and open-air balls are
being held. .
It had, by this time, grown dark. "With
the fall of night there was a sudden fan
fare of trumpets. This was the signal for
the illumination of . the square. Several
searchlights were thrown on the house,
bathing it in white light, while on the
facade, by a combination of electric lamps,
appeared a mauve-colored muse â¢ on a
golden background holding a lyre. At the
same time scrolls bearing the names of
the poet's principal works were 1 lighted
around the square and trailing around the
Place des Vosges burst into a multi-col
ored illumination, the fairy lamus being
so arranged along the arches and outlines
of the architecture as to reproduce a part
of the Alhambra. thus suggesting scenes
from Hugo's "Orientales."
The cortege concluded with girls repre*
senting- the muses of Paris. A young
Parisian working girl, chosen by her com
rades as the Muse of Labor, deposited a
simple bunch of flowers on the pedestal
of the statue, the bands meanwhile play-
Ing "The March of the Crowning of the
Muse," composed by Charpentier, the au

The official procession formed .at the
Hotel de Ville shortly before 5 o'clock and
proceeded to the Place des Vosges. On the
arrival of the procession the regimental
bands played the "Marseillaise," which
was followed by the rendering of Victor
Hugo's hymn, "Coux Qui Sent Morte
Pour la Patrio," set to music ! by Berlioz
by a choir of 1200 voices and the band of
the Republican Guard. The vice president
of the municipality of Paris presided at
the ceremonies and read a eulogy of Victor
Hugo by M. Dousset, the president of the
Municipal Council, who was absent on ac
count of the death of his father. A speech
was also made by the prefect of the Seine.
The house was handed over to the Clt>
of Paris and officially accepted by that
body. The concert was then resumed, a
number of pieces based on Victor Hugo's
works being heard, including the hymn
"Patrle" from *Las Chatlment" to a sim
ple but effective air composed by Bee
thoven. â¢'
The prettiest item in the exercises then
took place in the defiling past the statue
of Victor Hugo of 1200 school children,
~two by two, the little ones leading and the
elder pupils coming last. The boys and
girls marched past in alternating couples,
the boys carrying palm branches and the
girls bearing flowers, which they threw
at tho foot of the monument, soon form*
ing a mass of bloom and verdure, out of
the center of which rose the statue of the
poet.
night Illuminations End Festivities.
House Handed Over to the City.
PARIS. March 2.â The fete In commemo
ration of the centenary of Victor Hugo's
birth terminated to-day with the cere
mony of handing over to tho City of Paris
to serve as a museum the house In which
he lived in the Place des Vosses. The
weather was superb. ,
The exercises, which took place -within
the picturesque setting of the historic
Place des Vosges, with its quaint arcade
running beneath the red brick and stone
fronted houses on each of its. four sides,
were Very happily conceived and a vast
crowd gathered within the square to wit*
ness the proceedings. A plaster model ot
Victor Hugo, taken from the bas relief
"The Dream of the Poet" by the sculptor
Barreau, stood on a pedestal facing Vic
tor Hugo's house, situated in the corner
of the square. It represents the poet sit
ting on a rock, draped in antique fashion
and with a lyre at his feet. Overlooking
the monument and facing the house were
erected tribunes for the Senators, Depu
ties and other distinguished guests of the
municipality, whieii organized the fete and
defrayed the expenses, the municipal
council having voted an appropriation of
300,000 francs to carry out the centenary
festivities. â¢;<Â¦> Â¦ . v.

made the following statement:
"Berkeley numbers among Its residents

Chronic Diabetes, who 'came out to escape j
the rigors of an Eastern -winter and with
the hope that our California climate
would prolong her life. The Incurability
of her disease was so firmly fixed In her

Brlght's" disease and Diabetes were cur-
able. It made. but little Impression. How-
ever, after considering the matter, aha
later concluded to try It. She has now
been on the Diabetic Compound for nearly
three months. Although druggists will
understand that both Brlght's Disease
and Diabetes are considered Incurable,
yet from the number and names of thosj
reported cured I expected favorable re-
ports, but must say- I was surprised at
the results. She- Is now practically well-
There Is also another Berkeley case of
Diabetes on it that Is also well on the
road to recovery." "These Compound

early in the evening, and before nightfall
increased in velocity.' Trees were uproot

damaged by a portion of the roof being
blown off. For some time pandemonium

That the ferjp'-boat; Berkeley was. not
destroyed on. Saturday night with a fear
ful loss of life is due to Captain Ike Smith
of the tug Sea Queen. The Sea Queen
was the first boat to reach the imperiled
ferry-boat. There was but twelve feet
of water where the Berkeley was lying,
Jammed, against the wharf, and the sea
was breaking fiercely. The Sea Queen
went too close at first and narrowly es
caped being wrecked. ! Smith managed to
clear the breakers, however, and before
making another attempt to get a line un
the Berkeley got his own anchor ready
for use. His first attempt with the an
chor was a failure. The second . time,
however, he went further to windward,
let go his anchor, and by : paying out

Passengers and crew seized .this line and
soon had the Sea Queen's- hawser aboard

met at the washout, the passengers being
transferred around. The -regular train
then returned to Davisville, where it was
laid up. This washout caused all of the
overland trains from Oregon and the East
to be sent around by way of Stockton
and Martinez. It was thought safer to
bring them by way of Martinez than over
the Altamont.hill. There was a bafl slide
at. Vallejo Junction last night, but the

badly flooded, and the heavy wind trom

the Sacramento River up over the country
and washed out the roadway badly.

north of Santa Barbara. As the wires

is not known to the general railroad of

TACOMA. March 2.â The rebellion
which has broken -out in Southern
China is due mainly to .two causes.
According to Canton and Hong
kong news brought by the steamer
Shlnano Maru the poverty-stricken lower
classes of Kwang-si and Shansl believe
that the foreigners are responsible for
the additional heavy taxes which the
Chinese officials are wringing from them
to pay- off the- war indemnity x and the
claims filed by the various missionary so
cieties for damaged wrought during the
Boxer outbreak. ' Â¦
; The natives, therefore, believe that the
foreigners are wholly responsible for
their troubles and are preparing to vent
Iheir spite on the missionaries and the
native converts, whom they consider to
be leagued with the "foreign devils."
Only last month the Taotai Shen of
Shansl wrote to the missionary headquar
ters at Shanghai that his people were
very poor and hardly able to pay the war
Indemnity taxes, and at this time would
scarcely stand any additional demands
for Boxer claims. This was written after
he had given a warm welcome to the Rev.
and Mrs. Woodberry, sent from Shanghai,
to Tal Yuanfu In' Shansi to negotiate a
settlement of the missionary claims.
In Kwang-si and Qwang-tung the ban
filts and dissatisfied former soldiers have
banded together to drive but Ihe foreign

Eight battleships of the Royal Sover

to have improvements made which will
greatly increase their fighting efficiency.

ent inconsistency, one being that the Co
lumbia, after, barely eight years' exist
ence, is to be regarded as obsolete, or else
that the Secretary is not kept posted on
what Is going on in his' department.
PERSONAL. MENTION.
The Secretary of the Navy refers in his
latest report to the necessity of barracks
in preference to receiving ships for hous
ing enlisted men. He expresses the
ion that "it, of course, will be many years
before any vessel of the modern navy will
become sufficiently obsolete to be utilized
for this purpose." There is a singular
discrepancy between this expression of
opinion and the actual condition of affairs.
The Secretary's report Is dated November
4, 1901, and the Columbia, a cruiser of the
modern navy, commissioned April 23, 1894,
was substituted September 1 of last year
for the old Vermont as a receiving ship
at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and is indi
cated an such in the latest navy register.
Th<r Columbia's cost was $3,909,01126. in
cluding $350,000 for Bpoed premiums. Thero
are two explanations which 'may be of
fered to reconcile the Secretary'* appar-
-- 1 ; ruary 10. It Is a tabulated statement
from' the Navy Department giving the
â¢first cost and subsequent amounts .of
money expended in repairs of vessels built
since 18o3, bringing the data up to June 30.
1900. The most prominent ships, are the
Indiana, Massachusetts and Oregon, prac
tically, completed at the same time. The
completed cost of these yesels was $5,983,
371 98, ,$6,047,117 95 . and $6,575,032 76 In the
order named, and includes speed pre
miums, which were $38,500, $100,000 and
1175.000. respectively. Deducting the speed
premiums' the Oregon appears to have ex
ceeded the cost of the Indiana by $455,161
and that of the Massachusetts^ by about
$452,050, which is nearly 8 per cent over *ac
Eastern built ships. T.o offset this the re
pairs to the Indiana have required $283,
134 96," the Massachusetts 5224.383 19 and the
Oregon $67,758 09. It is especially in the
engine and boiler rooms that the Oregon
has manifested its vast superiority, for
while the repairs to the Indiana's ma
chinery cost $117,402 93 and the Massachu
setts' $107,849 79, the Oregon's repairs were
only $10,628 39. The latter ship has
steamed ten miles to one mile of the other
two, and proved herself the best ship in
any navy. She was cheap at $6,000,000,
and the Indiana and Massachusetts were
"lame ducks" as compared with the Ore
gon and costly at any price.

at San- Francisco over those con

The dry commercial figures, which arc accepted as
ihe best b.-.romctcrs of the country's commercial con
dition, continue to- make a gratifying showing. The
bank clearings for the past week were li.'j per cent
larger than during the corresponding week in 1901,
but the aggregate was; smaller than of late, footing
rp only about $1.95^,000.000, of which New York
furnished $1.27^.940,000. It is surprising â¢ what an
enormous proportion of the country's business is
rfonc in New York. The failures for the week were

cient consequence to attract attention. The financial

FEBRUARY was a month of storms all over
the United States, from California to New
. England, and the last day of the month was
characterized by floods, blizzards and other varieties
of winter weather over the greater portion of the
country. These adverse meteorological conditions
always restrict the volume of trade, yet the month
made a fir.e record~-j:evertheless. *The distributive
trade was good, collections were easy, failures were
i:ot above the normal and orders for merchandise for
spring delivery were fully as large as' anticipated.
There was a halting tendency in several lines, notably
wool, which is now being taken less freely by the
mills and Eastern dealers are showing less confidence
in the future of this staple. Per contra, however,
buyers in this State arc even now in the S:;n Joaquiri
Valley, where the spring shearing has just' com
menced, which is considered by San Francisco opera
tors as presaging^an ixtive and firm market. Provi
sions have been bobbing up and down at Chicago
and other Western centers, but whenever a decline
occurs it is usually followed by a recovery the next
day. The cereal markets have shown more tone, the
minor grains meeting with an improved demand at
tinner prices at Chicago, while Australia is in this
market for a large line of barley, which is now being
shipped. There has been no pronounced change in
wheat, the market having ruled dull all over the
world for the past fortnight. Iron and steel appear
cuieter on the surface, but the consumptive demand
is reported as heavy as ever, and the high prices for
finished products are " maintained without difficulty,
with most of the mills sold far ahead into the year.
Railroad earnings are r2ther less than at this time last
year, but the only comment to be made in this con
nection is that considering the violent storms all over
the country the wonder is that they are as large as
they are.

Evidently the South is slowly coming into touch
with the -life of the nation at large. She will find
that an increase of the urban population will. do hqr

As an .'illustration ;p1 the 'Southern view of the sub
ject, it is worth 'ribtin'g that a correspondent of the
Atlanta' Constitution in a recent letter, to that paper
said: ."While we are straining to send missionaries
â¢to China to improve their moral and religious condi
tions, in4he very next breath we admit that a flow of
emigrants from that country would improve us and
is almost a necessity. How sad does it seem when
we of Georgia know of what a blessed thing we had
in the rural homes, and th'en to 1 think ' that there
should ever' appear a willingness to give up this bless
edness to a race of heathens whose God is not our
G.od and whom we. can never hope to Christianize."

Mr. Alfred Sutro and Miss Rose New

Miss Newmarlc is. perhaps more widely

Bhe was formerly a pupil of Miss Lake's
school in San Francisco, where she was,
as much loved as admired for her charm

bright and prosperous Â¦ attorney, and a
graduate of the Harvard Law School. He

But the rare quality of. her voice is
only one of her virtues. She has a pretty
face, a bewitching manner and a figure
that sets oft her gowns to perfection. And
such dreams as Miss Foltz is wearing!
.Words seem altogether inadequate to de
scribe their loveliness. One that I con
sider, a poem is a gown of white Ttenajs
eance lace with zigzag strips of white
Bilk inserted in the lace. Perhaps the
reckless â¢ extravagance of Parisian de
signers adds to the charming effects pro
duced, for underneath the lace gown is
one of white chiffon, then etlll another
o* cream chiffon,' and still another of
corn-colored ntlk. Somehow the white
over the two thickneaaes of cream
subdue the yellow < tint and make
a . soft background . for the white
lace. Ttto dainty elbow, sleeves are bell
shaped, ending with plaited ruffles of
white chiffon. Frou-frou flounces of chif
fon n]Â«r. furnish the bottom of the trained
aklrt. Otherwise the gown Is quite plain
and. the quiet elegance la more pleasing'
than would bo any dttemptat garniture.
Another exquisite gown Is of white silk

ValencIiTiivH lace edged with the tlnieat
of lace ruffles. At the bottom of the skirt

Such is the issue which Hill puts before the coun
try as the programme of a great political party. It
will be well for Republicans to take- heed of it. If
any encouragement be given to the movement, this
country will have to undergo another long agitation,
which, by threatening to overthrow the established
fiscal system," will menace every industry and- Weil
nigh paralyze trade.

Republicans will- make a mistake if theyi underrate ;
the significance of that utterance. Hill may not be Â¦
a great statesman, but he is not a fool in matters of
practical politics. The efforts of reciprocity men and
other tariff tinkers to break the solidity of the pro-,
tective system show that there is danger in the issued
It is -clear, that if the system be broken in one place
it will he difficult to prevent a break elsewhere. Hill
has been prompt to see the advantage offered in- the
reciprocity schemes, and he declared reciprocity to
be . a Democratic policy. He did not undertake to
explain how a tariff devised solely for revenue pur
poses would afford any means for arranging reci
procity treaties, but that gap in his iogic would not
materially weaken the onslaught of the combined
free traders and reciprocity men if once an opportu
nity were given them by any division in the ranks of
the protectionists. ...
Hlir cheered his party:. by-declaring that their, op-,
portunity has come.' "If," said:-h'e,' "the expansion of
our trade 'and commerce 'is" 7 the pressing problem" of"
the time, why sh6uld ; notthe Democracy press it 'for-'

Mr. Hill's speech delivered at a dinner of the Man
hattan Club coincided 'with the arrival, in New York',
oNPrince Henry of Prussia, and accordingly did riot
receive the notice from the press.wKich; its merits &s
a. notable utterance upon the immediate -.policy of the
Democratic party by a statesman of "national ..
tioii and strong local prestige. It may., be.regarded 1 '
as the first authoritative announcement? of the' pro-^
gramme which the Eastern Democracy'fp'irrposes :t&
urge upon the party; and as Western ari'd- Southern
Democracy have been discredited by the failures' of .
Bryanism, it is fairly certain the programme will be
accepted by the party as a whole.
Mr. Hill declares for an affirmative platform de
manding: "A free constitutional government 'for , all
our possessions over which our .flag of right floats,"
the maintenance "of the Democratic doctrine of
home rule for the States," "the prohibition, restric
tion or regulation of dangerous corporate combina
tions of~ capital," "the expression of national sympa
thy with the struggling republics of South Africa,"
"the enactment of a tariff for revenue only," "the en
forcement of the Monroe doctrine" and "the election
of Â¦Uhited^States. Senators by direct vote of the peo
ple." He made no direct statement respecting free sil
ver issue, but said: "The Democratic party favors
the maintenance of the public credit at all times, rthe
steady reduction of the national debt and the payment
of all obligations of the Government according, to
their letter and^ spirit." , .Â» ;. t ,'Â¦ 'Â¦Â¦
The . speaker emphasized , the â¢ importance of the
tariff "question and urged that it be made the chief
though not the only issue in the coming campaign.
After declaring that it is not a new controversy but
an old one, he went on to say: "It is an issue upon
which every Democrat in. this broad land can stand,
without regard 'to .past differences^ or 'previous con
dition of servitude' to any other good, bad or
indifferent. It is not a dead issue, but a living issue;
it is not a' passing. issue, but an ever-present issue; it
is not a questionable issue, but an honest issue. It
is not 'a temporary expedient, b'ut a permanent and'
substantial principle, which had been the cornerstone
of our political faith during all the one hundred years'
.of our existence as a political organization. Jcffer
soh~ Madison, Monroe, Jackson, t Van Bttren, Marcy,
Wright, Casg,..Tilden, Cleveland,.)Hendricks, Bryan
and Stevenson. have all advocated it. It has stood

Within two years Mr. Patto
sien expects to see the volume of
business roll up to the $1,000,000
mark.
being so situated as to handle
goods direct from the c^ars, the
Pattosien, Company has another
undoubted advantage over the
high-priced downtown stores. It
effects an 'enormous saving in
rent that allows it to make very
material reductions in prices on
every line of furniture it carries.
And it is these reductions that
have gained for the company its
chief fame and caused buyers
from every section of the State to
go out to the Mission and do
their buying, for they are certain
to find not only the lowest prices
ever known, but the largest and
grandest exposition of furniture
and all household articles ever
gathered under one roof in the
West. And it is this state of af
fairs that has made the success ot
the Pattosien Company so phe
nomenal, notwithstanding the es
tablishment of one or more big
furniture stores on Market street.
The new store at Palo Alto that Is de
signed to afford easy buying for people of
the great Santa Clara Valley at strictly San
Francisco prlces-^that is Pattoslcn'8 un

The Fire Commissioners have had the
reorganization movement under consider
ation for several weeks, and notwith
standing the fact that the discussions
were private the news of the proposed
.changes leaked out and the men have
been steadily growing uneasy. According
to the plan agreed upon men who have
grown old in the service and are at pres
ent stationed in tho "downtown" districts
will be uhlftcd to the outlying districts,
where there will be lesa call upon them
for service. Tho younger men in the de
partment wlli be put in the places mart*
vacant by the transfer, and in conne
.quence there is great walling among tho
BUbordlnatea. The young men who have
been with companies that aro not called
out on an average a half-dnzrn times a
month naturally do not relish the Idea of
being transferred "downtown," where at
times they have four or five alarms to an
Â«wer in tho twenty-four hours. The flrut
natch of men booked for transfer Thurs
day will receive notice either to.-day or
ro-morrow to g*Â»t themselves in reading*
to move. The CpmmlaHloners will arnnt
them thÂ« privilege of protesting against
tho transfer. Â»n<T Â»Â«Â»hiÂ» protest "is baaed

Jockey Willie Buchanan writes from
France that he is down to Hard, work
again and in excellent shape for thV ap
proaching racing season, which opens in
that country on the 16th inst. He says
the Vanderbllt string comprises forty
horses in training. The California boy is
especially sweet on Ellsmere, a colt by
Hanover from Ella Plnkerton, which is*
liberally entered in all the big stakes, aa
well as the English derby.
Buchanan reports the weather so severe
that nearly all of the horses under the
French and English trainers are back*
ward in their training! Mr. Vanderbllt
had an Immense training shed constructed
with straw placed over the frozen ground.
The turns Are thrown up, so the horses
of the millionaire American can indulge
in gallops at moderate speed. Referring
to this, "Buck" says: "You see, we have
it on the native trainers when it. cornea to
getting horses ready early."
The entries for this afternoon events at
Oakland track are as follows:
First race â Seven furlongs; selling; four
year-olds and upward.

The greyhounds In tho running at Union
Coursing Park yesterday were bo evenly
matched as to leave tho spectators In
doubt as to their respective ability until
tho last course had been decided.
Somo, notably strong hares upset calcu
lations by running clever dogs oft their
feet. Bad Boy, favorite for the open stake,
drew ono of tho flyers. It was In the sec
ond round, and the Boy's chances against
Gold Ore wero considered bo good that
G to 1 was laid against the latter In the
ring. At the end of two minutes the hare
was still full of running and a brace of
relief dogs were released. The flyer from
the Merced plains outfooted th.e'four dogs
for a .time, but finally succumbed. Gold
Ore retired Bad Boy to his kennel by a
score of 1G points to 10..
Tho stake was ultimately won by Agglo
\V, which opened at 40 to 1 In the betting.
Sho met Hoy Ilughle in the tlnal and
won cleverly by a ecoro of 11 to 6.
In tho ..special stake Bonnie. Pasha beat
Trulee Boy in the all-Important deciding
course, The latter was unfortunate in
getting a two-minute course in the preced
ing round. Contrary to expectations this
did not iiikd all the edge off his speed, ub
he led lii.s fresher opponent to the hare/
and secured tho first turn. The hare thcrt
favored Jionnle Pusha sufficiently for hor
to run up a winning sequence of points,

1928 Howard street was also entered and
a â¢ telephone box rifled. The barn of W.
Kilpatrick, at 31 Lapldge street, was
broken open and a horse, wagon and four
cans of milk were stolen. Several stores

The body of Mrs. CottonVwas removed
to the Morgue and an inquest will be held
on Tuesday. .
W. J. Cotton, the husband, is the rep
resentative of the Mobile Company. He
came to Oakland nearly a year ago, since
which time he has maintained his resi
dence at the Metropole Hotel. He went
to San Jose about four months ago and
established an automobile company for
tourists. About ten days ago he returned
to this city, and has been with his wife
at the Metropole ever since.
The dead, woman belonged to one of the
best families of Boston. She is a great
great-granddaughter of General Warren
of Revolutionary fame and a niece of
former Governor Wlnslow of Massachu
setts." She was 39 years of age and the
mother of two children, both boys, one 7
years of age and the other 4. Both are
named after her family, one being John
Warren Cotton and the other Garret
Warren Cotton.
From Prominent Boston Family.
The theory . Is that Mrs. Cotton was
putting the revolver In the trunk when
the trigger caught either on the hasp* or
lock of the trunk or upon spme garment
in the trunk itself and that it was dis
charged as she was leaning." over the
place Into which she was about to put it.
Mr. Cottoa was nearly dazed by the
shock. Â¦ "We have been happily married
for. twelve years," he said, "and in that
time not a cross word has ever passed
between us. We have been chums, and
when I have been in hard straits finan
cially, as I have been, she haa always
been my warmest supporter and helper.
We have had a most happy, life, and
this is terrible to me.'"
Mr. Cotton would not at first believe
that his wife was dead, and insisted that
she must have simply fainted. But when
he found the bullet .wound he was com
pelled to realize that tbe worst had oc
curred.
Mrs. Cotton had fallen back in the small
space between the bed and the trunk. Tne
bullet entered the left breast, passed di
rectly through the Jieart and out of the
back. Mrs. Cotton did not utter a word
after she was shot. * Dr. J. T. Kitchins
was called, and when he arrived he found
life' extinct, and a bullet wound that
passed squarely through the body, with
almost no inclination either up or down.
Mr. Cotton wa3 telephoned for and told
that his wife had fainted and that he waa
wanted at once. Dr. Medros, who was
with him at the club, accompanied nim iu
the hotel. .
Death Came Instantly.
The trunk was behind the bed In the
sleeping-room, and Mrs. Cotton opened
it and was stooping, over . to put th.e
weapon in when there w,as a report. MIsh
Hall, who was in the front room, turned
and saw Mrs. Cotton sink down between
the bed and the trunk: She ran into the
hallway and cried foe help. In a moment
the proprietor, R. M. Briere, and several
guests and employes of the hotel were in
the room. â¢ V Â¦ . Â¦ .
Â¦.While putting her husband's revolver
away in a trunk shortly before dinner
time this evening Mrs. Edna Warren Cot
ton, wife of W. J. Cotton, accidentally
shot herself, the bullet passing directly
through her heart and causing almost. In
stant death. The shootlngNiccurred in the
rooms of Mr. and Mrs. Cotton in the
Hotel Metropole. Mrs. Cotton was pre
paring to dreas to 'attend a dinner party
to be given this evening by her husband at
the Athenian Club. Mr. Cotton was at
the Athenian Club at the time preparing
for the dinner and Mrs. Cotton 1 was with
Miss MabeJ Hall, a young , lady friend,
dressing to Join him. â¢ â¢Â¦ â¢
While the ladles were preparing for tho
dinner they discovered that Mr. Cotton
had left his revolver on the table in the
front room of the suite. When he retired
the night before he had placed the weapon
upon the table and it had become partly
covered with some papers and he had not
taken it with him wnen.he went to the
club. Tho ladies had aJlttle discussion as
to whether the weapon s.iould be put
away or not. Miss Hall expressed fear of
firearms and did not want it touched, but
Mrs. Cotton assured. her that the. safest
way was, to place it m her husband's
trunk, which she started to do.

drama of deen and deadly dye by the
suggestive title of "The Last Stroke." It
concerns itself with the Cuban war of
1^94. the characters being Spanish and
American army people mostly, and Â¦ it is
a cold moment in the drama when there
is not an abduction, duel or battle taking
place; The piece wijl be put on with the
care and elaborateness that the Central
is noted for, and should prove an excel

"The Serenade" is another second
weeker that is making excellent promise
of a long run, at the Tivoll, of course.
Anna Lichter Is a" dainty Yvonne, that
â¢was sung by Alice Neilsen on the opera's
debut here; Frances Graham has the
Jessie Bartlett Davis role, and Signor Fer
ris Hartman is his impecunious Highness
the Duke of Santa Cruz. These clever
folks are well supported by the rest of
the company and the opera is staged In
a stunningly pretty fashion. .-â¢(
"The French Maid" is in Its second
week at Fischer's Theater and going
much more comfortably than on its first
presentations. The company Is beginning
to work together with some semblance of
a bowing acquaintance with one another,
and the principals continue to please in
their respective roles: Mme. Pilar Morin,
Miss Lillian Coleman, Wilfred Blake and
Harry Hermser make a musical cojmedy
quartet that it would not be easy for
many companies to duplicate, and are the
best of their "kind. "The French Maid"
gives way to "Little Christopher" when
the former's vogue dies down.
George Qber, in his list of Hoyt's c6me
dies . at the Grand Opera-house has
reached "A Contented Woman," Â¦ perhaps
the funniest of all the Hoyt efforts. The
beautiful Caroline Miskel-Hoyt originally
took the name role, and will be well re
membered therein by local playgoers. The
comedy will be well cast with the strong
er members of the Grand Opera-house
stock company, and Mr. Ober's part is of
course safe In his humorous hands.
The Auers astounded the audience by
making pictures out of rags. They are
quaint comedians and their act Is a novel
one. The three Meers repeat their clever
slack wire walking and "Billy" Clifford
sings a number of new songs and presents
some very good imitations of people he
has met. J. C. Nugent and Grace Fertlg
continue "The Absent Minded Beggar,"
the sketch that scored a hit last week'.
The biograph closes an excellent vaude
ville show.
"Woods and Morse are singing comedi
ans and do a neat turn. The Probyn La

Nearly every number on the Orpheum's
bill is new and well worth seeing. The
ten Nelsons were seen at this playhouse
a year ago, and their feats of daring and
agility created a sensation then and now.
They do some marvelously clever acro
batic work and are rewarded with enthu
siastic applause. Eva Mudge, a prepos
sessing American girl, who captured Lon
don, repeated her conquests last night.
Her voice Is pleasing. She changes her
attire at lightning speed and has a num
ber of new songs.
The Alcazar Theater will have one of
the neatest, sweetest, cleanest, prettiest
little comedies that has been seen in the
city for some time this week, with "A
White Horse Tavern" for the bill. It has
been given but once before here, at the
California, by a clever but unheralded
company that saw half a house of empty
seats tbe first night and played to stand-
Ing room only during the last days of
its engagement. The play is being pro
duced in the Alcazar's very best style, and
should have a large patronage. "A Coat
of Many Colors" follows.
At the Columbia Theater to-night the
much looked for production of .Augustus
Thomas' most successful play, "Arizona,"
will hold the boards. The play has been
much discussed since Its first presentation
some two seasons past, and will be staged
here in the same elaborate manner that
marked its successful runs'of 300 nights in
New York and 200 nights in Chicago.
Thomas is credited with having even sur
passed his excellent former efforts, "Ala
bama" and "In Mizzoura." The company
to appear in the piece includes some well
known names.
The women, who don't count very much
any way, are headed by Charlotte Tntell,
who shows neither temperament nor tech
nique as the Princes P'lavia. Ida Werner
makes a stunning old woman, and
Eleanor Carr is pleasing as Rosa, her
daughter. The play is excellently staged
and well worth a visit. '
"The Prisoner of ' Zenda" will appro
priately be put on on Thursday and Sat
urday afternoons.
Rupert of Hentzau, the villain, also
added much to the illusion and was played
in unctuous fashion by LukeConners. The
fencing scene between RassendyU and
Rupert is simply "bully"â there fs no
other word. The audience holds its breath
till the false knight bites the dust through
a whirl of pistol shots, gleam of foils and
breathlessly realistic wrestling. W. N.
Wadsworth does a telling . sketch of
James,- the man, and the rest of the com
pany fills in the picture without a .blur.
It is not the first time in the Califor
nia's history that the audience has hap
pened into an unheralded gem of respecta
ble ' radiance. Last night's audience did
tumble unexpectedly into something of
the kind, and the company presenting the
play may be said to nave' at least three
starful interpreters and any number of
clever minor upholders. The dual role of
King Rudolph and Rudolph Rassendyll
was assumed by Harry Leighton, a virile,
facile and- convincing player, who
achieved an unqualified success. His
changes from the weak-kneed, degenerate
monarch to the gallant and manly young
Englishman were managed with extreme
alertness and complete illusion, and both
characters were sustained with a convic
tion not excelled by James Hackett him
self, who created the part. Sapt, the
good colonel, was equally well played by
George B. Miller, who got "the kindly,
fiery diplomat to the last white hair of his
bristling mustache.
The sequel play, like the sequel story,
is usually one of the things best left un
done. TWs cannot bo said In any degree
Of "Rupert of Hentzau," the week's bl.l
at the California Theater. "Rupert of
Hentzau," sequel to "The Prisoner of
Zenda," has the uncommon characteris
tics of excelling the story from which it
Is taken and living up to its preceding
play. The story, unfortunately for the
play's success with the usual romantic
play's audience, ends unhappily, but oth
erwise there is no reason" why "Rupert of
Hentzau" should % not enjoy the same
vogue as its predecessor, "Tne Prisoner of
Zenda." It is picturesque to a degree, full
of ingenious incident and stirring situa
tions, knitted together with an aiert and
convincing hand. One is plunged at once
into the tnkk of the story, the time three
years after the ending of "The Prisoner
of Zenda." The. Princess Flavla has con
tinued to send onco a year, a rose and
a message of love to the man who im
personated her royal lover, tne King of
liuritania, and with whom she fell in
love. This third year she sends, besides
the rose, a letter that informs Rasscndyil
that for the right's sake all communica
tion between them must cease." At the
same time the Princess, confesses that she
still loves him. Rupert of Hentzau, a re
bellious subject of King Rudolph, who
has been exiled and who has also been in
jured by Rassendyll, gets hold of the tell
tale letter, and the fat's in the fire. The
story is told with unflagging interest
throughout and is undeniably one of the
best romantic plays ever seen here. Also,
it is one of the best acted.

Beifert will probably remain in jail a
long time. His aunt has expressed a will
ingness to settle with T. B. Lester, who is
the complaining witness in the present
case, but a score of other charges will be
filed to-day accusing the druggist of pass
ing worthless checks, and his friends will
have to increase their contributions con
siderably to satisfy these latter claims.
As an explanation for the presence of
Captain Callunden of the Morse Detective
Agency at Esparto and his assistance In
the "thrilling pursuit," It was stated that
in order to guard the movements of the
city's sleuths on their expeditions out of
town in search of the murderer arrange
ments had been made with the Morse De
tective Agency to furnish men for these
excursions, who would simply follow the
instructions of the regular detectives.
Nothing was then said of Morse's men
having obtained the Seifert clew, but
when the sensation was punctured Cap
tain Seymour and his pet sleuths were
keen to avoid the ridicule that the fiasco
broutrht on them.
Notwithstanding these protestations and
the attempt to shift the responsibility for
the Seifert foolishness, the night the ar
rest was made the detective department
was as jealous as a dog with a bone lest
they should not get credit for the cap
ture.
Detectives Wanted Credit.
C. A. Seifert. the druggist who was
taken into custody at Esparto Friday by
order of Captain Seymour on the sus
picion that he was concerned in the Ful
ler murder mystery. Is still In jail under
the charge of obtaining money under false
pretenses. The warrant under which he
was taken into custody was sworn out
on this latter charge, but the police
thought so little of it that Seifert was
allowed to wander around the city for a
month unmolested by Captain Seymour's
sleuths until tbe somnolent Chief of De
tectives had an inspiration that Seifert
killed Nora Fuller because he. wore a
high hat occasionally.
Captain Seymour was vigorously en
gaged yesterday in trying to convince
himself and everybody else who came near
him that he was not responsible for the
Seifert fiasco. He was warm in his decla
rations that he never put any faith in the
theory that Seifert was concerned in the
Fuller murder. He said that the Infor
mation was furnished by the Morse De
tective Agency, and the arrest was due
entirely to the investigations carried on
by its men. His excuse for sending Detec
tive Hamill down to Woodland to appre
hend Seifert was that he feared unless
the man was arrested and the circum
stances connecting him with the murder
fully investigated it might be said some
time in the dim beyond that the detec
tive department of San Francisco had
knowingly let the real criminal slip
through its fingers. Captain Seymour was
building for posterity when he caused
Seifert's arrest.
Self ert Still in Jail.
The unusual meeting of the Commis
sioners on the Sabbath created consider
able speculation among the rank and file,
and until it became known that Sey
mcur'a blundering methods were the
cause of the conference many thought
that the civil service examinations had
something to do with it. Knowing that
he has a difficult task before him on ac
count of the bungling work of Seymour,
Chief Wittman intends to take a fresh
etart by investigating the case from its
very beginning.
As it was evident that Captain Seymour
was r.s far from a solution of the mys
tery as he was on the afternoon the de
composed body of the unfortunate girl
was found in the Sutter-street house, he
was firmly told that the Chief would as
fumÂ« charge of the case and personally
direct the efforts of the detectives to ap
prehend the strangler. Crestfallen and
disheartened at his own stupidity, Sey
mour bowed and left the room.
Seymour Is Informed.
Realizing his utter unfltness as the head
of the detective department two of the
1'olice Commissioners yesterday turned
down Captain Seymour and ordered Chief
Witiman to personally conduct the pur
suit of the brutal murderer of Nora Ful
ler. Satlstied that Seymour Is totally in
competent to run down the assassin Com
missioner JCewhall, president of the board
visited the Hall of Justice yesterday and
demanded to know of Chief Wittman
what had been done to solve the mys
tery. After they had discussed thÂ« blun
dering methods of the head of "the de
tective bureau for at least three hours
Mr. Ncwhall requested Wittman to take
up the case in which Seymour haa shown
himself to be thoroughly unreliable.
Â¦While- they were discussing the matter
Commissioner llowell appeared and
warmly indorsed Mr. Newhall's action
In taking the case out of the hands of

Baer Tells of Grow h of
Christian Endeavor
Societies.
Urges Hearers to Fight for
Good Measures and
Good Men.
John Willis Baer, general secretary of
the World's Christian Endeavor Union,
addressed four large assembles yesterday.
In the morning the evangelist preached at
Calvary Presbyterian Church, in the aft
ernoon he delivered an address at a masa
meetlng in the Young Men's Christian As
sociation hall and in the evening preache'J
a sermon at Trinity Presbyterian Church,
Just prior to which he spoke to a number
of thoee specially interested in Christian
Endeavor work;
In his address in the afternoon Mr.
Baer began by referring to the twenty
first birthday of the Christian Endeavor
Union, and said that its remarkable nu
merical growth proved that it was not a
man-mutiu institution, lor from tlrty
members of the first society it had b.o.-.-
Bomed to three and a half millions. He
touched on the inter-denomlnatlonal
growth,- and showed that while tne rtr -t
society was Congregational there were at
this time- no less', than forty denomina
tions in the movement. Furthermora.
said the speaker, the society is interna
tional, for there is not a single nation m
the world but has Ha Christian Endeavor
Society.
Speaking of the duties of the members,
he made a point of "Christian citizen
ship," and urpcd all voters to go Jto the
primaries of their respective parties an.l
there tight for good men and good meas
ures. There were, he said, 6u,000 young
men in the Christian Endeavor Society
casting their first votes every year.
Mr. Baer then spoke of the missionary
work, and reported that $000,030 had been
given by the societies- for missionaries
last year. In making an earnest appeal
for more work among young boys and
girls between the ages of 8 and 12 years
the speaker announced that at this date
there were no less than 18,000 junior socie
ties of Christian Endeavorers. He begged
and showed the necessity for still more
active service and a deeper spirit of con
secration on the part of the individual
members, and reminded his hearers that
what was needed Viow, this twenty-flrst
anniversary, was not more method, but
more motive on the part of the rank and
file. -
Connors Brought Back.
Timothy Connors, the absconding treas
urer of the Hod Carriers' Union, was
brought back from Bakersfleld last night,
by Detective Reynolds and locked up In
the City Prison. .
Connors admits his guilt and says he
will plead guilty when his case is called
in the Superior Court. He claims that he
lost the- money he stole playing the dog
and horse races.

1O1IICHANTS OP HONOLULU
ASK FOR FEDEBAL AID
HONOLULU* Feb. 24.â The Merchants'
Association of Honolulu has adopted res
olutions asking the aid of the Federal
Government to put Honolulu in first-class
sanitary condition, as was done by the
Government in the case of Havana and
other places in the island of Cuba, and the
new possessions. Honolulu has had three
cases of bubonic plague this month, and
though the situation is not regarded as at
all serious it is one with which, it \J
claimed, the Federal authorities should
help to deal. " The fact that. the Govern
ment spent large sums of money in help
ing other places, such as Havana, is com
mented upon as a reason why Hawaii -
has a right to expect similar aid.

NEW ADVERTISEMENTS.
A SAN FBANCISCO PHYSICIAN.
Uses Herpicide Successfully in Treat-
ing Sycosis of the Beard.
"He says: "I recently treated a case of
sycosis (similar to 'barber'a Itch') of the
lower lip with Newbro's Herpicide. Thera
was an extensive loss of beard with In-
flammation extending well down on the
chin. The result of the application of
Herpicide -was most gratifying. The loss
of beard ceased and a new growth of
hair is now taking place over the once-
Inflamed area. .
"(Signed.) Melville E. O'Neill, M. D..
845 Howard St..
"San Francisco, Cal."
Herpicide kills the dandruff germ and
causes the hair to grow abundantly.

Impossible to give up coffee, so they hope

but it goes on with Its work Just the

THE last chapter In a story of
rullty love extending over three
years was written In blood some
time during Saturday night at
the United States Hotel, on
"She was my wife," he said. '"We were
married in Oakland five years ago' and
went to BakersHeld to live. I did every
thing I could to hake her happy.-" I am
a railroad conductor and my run made it
necessary for me to remain^ away from
home forty-eight hours at a. tlmel Dur
ing my absence this man Gallagher.. who
Is a well-borer by occupation, became
enamored of my wife. She found some
thing In. him to like. too,, because three
years ago I returned home to find that
she had fled with him. I tried to bear
my sorrow as. host I could, but I always
loved her, and whenever I; knew her
whereabouts I besought her to return to
me. I saw her last about -two years, ago
She was then on her way to Bradley to
Join Gallagher, who -was employed theVe.
She refused to leave him and I let her go.
."I arrived in San Francisco yesterday,
being brought here by. information: that
my wife was stopping with Gallagher at
the Golden West Hotel and that- he was
abusing her. ; I brought a. gun with. me,
intending to kill this man: I went; to tho
Golden West this morning and sent , a
messenger boy In to te.l Gallagher that a
man wanted to see- him on the sidewalk.
The clerk told the boy. that Gallagher and
my wife had left the hotel. â¢Â¦ I. then went
for a walk, and on my rtturn tomyroom
I was notified of the tragedy -'. â¢ Â¦Â¦Â¦
. "Gallagher was a thoroughly. bad man.
He deserted a wife and three children In
Bakersfleld ..to elope with the' woman he
killed, last night, and from what I hear
he was in the habit of â¢ abusing her
shamefully ever since he took her
from me. ' . - . Â¦

the avowed intention of either inducing
her to return to him or killing the man
who was responsible for her ruin.
After much solicitation he was ' at last
allowed to view the bodies in the same
positions they were found. He gazed down
at the face of the woman for some min
utes, with every evidence of deep emotion,
and then said: ; .
"Yes, that is poor -May, and that is the
man who took her away, from my home.
Poor, little girl, you have paid dearly for
the pain you caused me, and as God hears
me, I forgive you."

40 years and bears evidence of being pros

A telegram received ' last night from
Bakersfield says that' all parties to the
tragedy are well known there. Gallagher
has been â¢ employed as a well-driller by
several companies in the Kern River dis
trict and made his headquarters at Kern
City. Mrs. Wilson 1 was the second wife
of W. B./ Wilson, a railroad conductor,
his .first wife having died -about eight
years ago... The relations existing between
Gallagher and Mrs. Wilson were generally
known in. Bakersfield - and Kern City
When: Wilson left for San Francisco he
confided to his friends that the object of
his journey was to search for his former
.wife. . ... .
The bodies were removed to the Morgue
and will be kept there until the Coroner
has held an Inquest over them. The room
at > the hotel where the tragedy occurred
will be in charge of the Coroner .until
after the inquest.' â¢
Gallagher was rather shabbily dressed,
but in his pockets were found |42 80. One
trunk.iand two grips were, in the room,
the .trunk containing the clothing and ef
fects of the woman. There were some
letters and photographs among them, but
nothing to show that â¢ the terrible deed
was premeditated. -
No one around the hotel saw them Sun
day night and nobody heard the shots
which ended their, lives. This was prob
ably due to the noise of the storm which
was raging outside. Mrs. Benjamin, an
employe of the restaurant on the first
floor of the hotel, says she heard a wom
an's screams Sunday night about 11
o'clock, but she, was busy at the time and
did not pay much attention to the inci
dent. It was probably at this time that
Gallagher administered the beating which
was preliminary .' to the murder and sui
cide. The electric lights were still burn
ing . in the room when the door was
forced, showing that they had been burn
ing all-night.

to vacate their room and Policeman Pearl
was called to eject them. He says they
were both under the influence of liquor
when he went to the room. The man had
destroyed a hat belonging to the woman
and she claimed he had otherwise abused
her. She said she wanted to leave him
because he was cruel. Gallagher told her
he could not live without her, but they
finally agreed to separate. They moved
their effects out of the Golden West and
evidently became reconciled again, be
cause they went together to the United
States Hotel Thursday night and secured
a room together. They were very quiet
and attracted no particular "notice there.

Last night W. L. . Wilson, .the former
husband of the murdered woman,
slept on- the same floor of . the
hotel where his wife lay dead
and had no Intimation of the terrible se
quel of her unfaithfulness to him or of
her presence in the house untllan hour
after the bodies had been found. He had
come up from Bakersfleld last night with
Husband in ; the Hotel.
As soon as news was received of the
tragedy at police headquarters. Detectives
TJ Bailey and Tim Reardon were deÂ«
tailed to take charge of the room. They
expelled the. crowd of. curious spectators
and took care of the effects until the ar.

When entrance was gained the room pre-
B^l e i ai J. awfur sight. The woman lay
with her head against the -wall. Her face
was severely bruised; which must have
come from a beating adminstered
b e f Â°re_f1ie killing. The position of
the body showed no signs of a struggle.
She must have fallen and died almost in
stantly. The surroundings indicated that
after the murder the man had proceeded
to commit suicide with the utmost delib
eration. He had tilted the glass in the
mirror to such an angle as would afford
him a good reflection of himself as he
sat in the chair. His undershirt was not
perforated by the bullet, but the flap was
slightly powder burned, indicating that he
had pulled it back and pressed the muzzle
of the revolver against his naked flesh.
In the room were nine empty beer bot
tles, which had been brought there since
the chambermaid had cleaned up the
apartment the afternoon before. The bed
had not been occupied but a, broken bot
tle was found on it and marks which indi
cated that Gallagher had thrown the
woman across the bed and beaten her
with the bottle .

"I met May and -Gallagher on the street
last Thursday evening and she told me
she was stopping at the United States

His upper, outer clothing had been re
moved, with the exception of the under
shirt. From the position of the body and
the condition of the clothing, it was evi
dent that after Gallagher had sped the
bullet which ended the woman's life he
had drawn a chair in front of the mirror,
eat down, pulled back the flap of his un
dershirt and Inflicted a wound on himself
that proved instantly fatal. His heaa
hung back over the chair, and the open,
staring- eyes were turned in the direction
â¢Where his victim's body lay.
On the floor beside the dead b<Jdy of the
man was found the weapon with which
the crime was committed. It was a 88
callber Smith & Wesson revolver and two
of the cartridges In it had been exploded.
The woman was fully dressed,
Â¦with the exception of one shoe,
which had been removed. Her right
hand was crossed over her breast
and In her left hand was the key
to her trunk. A email diamond and gai
