FORT DE FRANCE, Martinique, May 20.â Destruc- A
tion is again threatened by Mont Peled, the volcano
having resumed an activity even greater than that ex
hibited when St. Pierre was" wiped out of existence.
For twenty-four hours the volcano has been in constant erup
tion and explosions have beeji frequent. All in Fort de France
are filled with panic. The island has been shaken by the work
ings of the forces within the earth, and every one awaits in "
fear a cataclysm even worse than that which recently filled
the world with horror and consternation.
Last night was one of terror and wild alarm here. The
earth seemed to irave lost its foundations. Up through the
crater of Mont Pelee poured a storm of death. The culmina
tion came at an early hour this morning when there occurred
an explosion so terrible that walls in this,\city\vere shaken down
and the inhabitants fled to the open country.
At this time nothing definite is known of conditions farther
to the north. Smoke fills the air, darkening the sky. Ashes,
are falling steadily. When the heavens are filled with lightning,
as. frequently happens, it can be seen that-Mont-Pelee-has *-not ~
ceased to throw out a great column of lava and stones. There.
# has been a perfect calm in the air, yet the waters of^the Carib
bean are iashed to a fury, indicating that the same forces that
cause the volcano to labor are working tremendous changes
at the bottom of the sea. Words are inadequate to describe the
actual conditions. Disaster is expected at any moment, and in
the harbor every ship has steam up and is ready to slip cable
and speed away. 'Â¦â¢
Beset by imminent and terrible danger, a party of officers
and men from the Cincinnati and Potomac went ashore at St.
Pierre* yesterday and brought away the body of Thomas D. '
Prentis-, the American Consul.
Advised to forsake their burden and save themselves, the
men who were carrying the body refused to do so. On they
stumbled, through an atmosphere each second growing darker
and more stifling. Their ears were deafened by the crashes
that came from Mont Pelee. In the roadstead the British cruiser
Indefatigable was putting to sea, sounding her siren, whichmost
of the time was silenced by the great noise of the mountain.
With steam up the Potomac stood ready to run as soon as
the rescue party could get from shore and on board. To the.
general din it added its note of alarm.
Finally the brave men were 'forced -to. rest their burden at
the water's edge, while they made all spee^d to the Potomac.
They were barely in time. As the steamship got well under way r
another flood of fire poured down from Pelee and a broad
stream of lava ran into the sea, while out of the sky rained a
storm of rocks and ashes. N
In spite of the threatening aspect of the volcano it was de
termined later yesterday to make another attempt . to recover
the bodies of Mr. Prentis and Mr. Japp, the British Consul. By j
permission I accompanied the searching party, which was di
vided into two squads. One led by Ensign Miller went to the
site of the American consulate, and soon had the body of Mr.
Prentis encased in a metallic and hermetically sealed .coffin. Six
stalwart fellows shouldered the body and started with it for the
In the meantime another party, led by Lieutenant McCor
mick of the Potomac, had proceeded to the British consulate,
about a half-mile to the northward of the American consulate.
Fortunately this was within view of the crater of Mont Pelee.
Lieutenant McCormick saw a column of smoke and fire belch
from the volcano, from the side of which a streak of molten
lava flowed.
Directing his men to make all haste back to trie Potomac
the lieutenant turned aside to give warning to the party which
was^ carrying away the body of the American Consul.
"For God's sake, boys, get to the boat quick if you would
save your lives," he gasped. "The volcano has exploded and
destruction is upon us." :
At that instant there was a crash in the sky, back of which
it seemed as though scores of thunderbolts had been forced
into. one. As it died away the loud siren of the Indefatigable,
which was in the roadstead, screamed a warning. The British
cruiser almost' immediately .. put out to sea at top spe'ed\ With
out cessation the whistle of the Potomac was blowingA There '
was another rumble and the sky was filled'with lightningAThen,"
asl looked backward, Mont Pelee cast upward a vast column
a mile or more high. â¢ V ; .' \

EARLY RETIREMENT FROM
OFFICE IS ANNOUNCED.
The actual transfer of the control of the
island was scheduled to occur exactly at
noon (Havana time), which is 12:30 p. m.
(Washington time), but those Invited to
witness the ceremony were requested to
be at the palace at 11:30 o'clock. They in
cluded, besides the American officers and
the members of President-elect Palma's
Cabinet, the members of Congress, the Su

provinces, the officers of the visiting war-
Much curiosity was aroused by a statue
of freedom, which had been raised during
the night in Central Park, upon tha
pedestal where, for centuries, a statue of
Queen Isabella had stood. During the
morning a bountiful breakfast was given
to several thousand poor children by Mr.
Paine of Boston, who passed the winter
In Havana for many years. As the day
advanced the heat of the sun became in
tense and the weather grew hotter every
minute. â¢
The early morning was cool* and de
lightful, and the entire population, rein
forced by thousands of visitors, was
abroad soon" after daylight. All was ani
mation and expectancy. The streets were
6warming witn people and were filled with
a ceaseless din. The babble of voices was
drowned by the sharp cries of drivers and
the clamor of warning bells. As the
coachmen drove their carriages madly
over the stony pavements pedestrians had
a busy time keeping out of the way of the
wheels. There are 4000 public carriages In
Havana, and this morning each one of
them seemed speeding somewhere on a
life or death mission.
The decorations along the water . front
were exceedingly lavish and all the ship
ping in the harbor â¢ was dressed in gala
attire. The majority of the ships flew
the American ensign at the main and the
Cuban colors at the fore or mizzen. The
United States armored cruiser Brooklyn,
which was to take General Wood away,
and the steamer Morro Castle .' of â¢ the
Ward line, on which ?the trotfps were to
embark, as well as the foreign warships
which had been sent by their Govren
ments to be -present at the .birth of the
new republic, were dressed with streams
of signal flags, fore and aft, man-of-war
fashion. The American colors, which
were to be hauled down in a" few hours,
'still floated above the grim walls of the
fortresses which guard the entrance of
the harbor. Not another bit of color
ehowed upon them.
LAVISH DECOBATIONS.
glimpses could be caught of luxuriant
gardens, in cool, inner courts. Many of
the balconies jutting from the whlte
â¢walled buildings were adorned with
roses. Nature seemed In harmony with
the spirit of the festivities. The parks
were literally aflame with tropical flowers
and the vaulted sky aboye might have
been chiseled out of turquoise. Above
every red tiled roof ; rose a Cuban flag.
The whole city seemed, suddenly buried
beneath a forest of waving banners. Â¦
ANIMATION AT PAT.ACK
The palace is an imposing yellow stone
structure, which for centuries was the
residence of the captains general of Spain.
Since the American occupation it has
been the official headquarters of the mili
tary' Governor. Tne actual transfer of
the island occurred in the audience cham
ber, which formed a fine setting for the
historic' occasion. The chamber was to
day exactly as it was when the Spaniards
departed, except that the portraits of the
capains general, which hung upon its
walls, are gone.
Owing to the limited space the people
were to have no sight of the ceremony
to be enacted here which was to con
stitute them, a nation before the world,
but outside they were to witness a spec
tacle which would stir their pulses, for
they were to see the beloved five-barred
and single-starred flag, which Cespedes
first threw to the breeze in 1868, at the
opening of the ten years' war,' raised by
the act of the United States above the
palace. This thing which was to happen
had been the dream of their lives and of
their ancestors for generations. Their
parents, brothers and friends had gone to
their deaths to accomplish It. No strange
wonder then that hours before the time
set they began flocking here from all
quarters of the city. Many were already
before the palace with the rising sun and
some even slept In the park to be certain
not to miss this sight.
A portion of the plaza was kept clear
by the police very early. The remainder
was packed with people so thick that the
ground seemed alive.
Soon air the Bide streets .running into
the plaza were choked Into a solid mass
of humanity and every door and window
fronting the square was walled In with
faces, white and black, old and young
male and female. The crowds sought the
roofs, overflowing every building that
commanded a view of the flagstaff on the
palace. As far as the eye could- see the
roof-llnea were fringed with human
freight. It was a sight to live forever in
memory.
Drawn up below. In the open space of
the plaza, were eight dismounted troops
?u i th t S , even J& Cavalry, with sabers at
their heels. Their horses were already on
board the steamer which was to take
them back to the United States
Shortly before 11:40 a. m. those who
were to witness the ceremony began to
arrive in carriages through a street kept
clear by the police. All the naval of
ficers were arrayed in full uniform re
splendent in gold . braid and plumed
chapeaux. The Cubans generally wore
black frock /suits, white waistcoats and
silk hats. They formed a distinguished
looking -assemblage as they gathered in
the audience chamber.
The ceremony itself was brief and eim-
ships, the foreign consuls^ William Jen
nings Bryan, the other visiting American
statesmen, several of Senor Palma's Cen
tral Valley (New York) neighbors; Hora
tio Rubens., counsel for the former Cuban
junta; Colonel William Astor Chanler and
a few other specially invited guests.

W., WASHINGTON, May 20.-Emperor
William's purpose to establish and main
tain most cordial relations with the
Unite'd "States has 'again \been demon
strated by two facts which have been
brought io the attention of the adminis
tration officials." : Â¦' ''
The most important "is that he con
sidering the sending- of Prince Friedrich
AVilhelm,. "Crown Prince of Germany, to
the United Si Statesf to participate in tho
ceremonies in connection with the unveil
ing of the statue of ..Frederick the Great
which he. proposes to donate to this Gov
ernment..;. -.-,â¢ "' ' .-" ' . -
The second':is a formal request made
through the- German Embassador tnac
.the United States accord protection to
German interests menaced by the revolu
tion existing in Colombia. .
If the Emperor sends the Crown Prince
the latter will be given' a reception worthy
of his distinguished position. Friedricn
Wilhelm is 20 years of age, and is said to
be a tactful and worthy representative of
his father. If he- should be ordered to
Washington he will be accompanied by a
suite of high-ranking military and naval
officers. Emperor William will make his
son's visit, so far as he can, even more
pretentious than that ot Prince Henry.
'Secretary Hay has willingly undertaken
the protection. of. German; Interests on the
isthmus Of Panama, Â¦; The request of the
Embassador has been referred to the Sec
retary of the.Navy^ with- 1 a request to is
sue appropriate instructions to the com
manding officers of the cruiser Philadel
phia at .Panama. and the gunboat Machias
at Bocas del Torotolook after the in
terests of Germany. -
The -authorities here believe that the

SPOKANE, May 20.â J. F. Walker was
discovered by soldiers yesterday after
noon wandering aimlessly about Fort
Wright. He is now in jail awaiting ex
amination on a charge of insanity. Walk
er, who it is believed recently came from
the Sound, says he was war correspond

his present condition might be in part the

WASHINGTON, May 20.â For the third
time within a week the House has in
structed its conferees on matters of dis
pute between the Senate and House. To
day the Instructions were given on
amendments to the army bill before the
conferees had even considered the mat
ters in controversy.
The motion to instruct was made by
Cannon of Illinois, chairman of the Ap
propriation Committee. It was resisted
by Hull, chairman of the Committee on
Itllitary Affairs, and the somewhat spir
ited debate which followed developed an
' tagonism between the committees. The
amendment which Cannon aimed at was
that increasing the appropriation for mil
itary posts from $3,000,000 to $4,000,000.

A search was commenced at once and
word was sent to the neighbors, who dis
patched their employes to the assistance
of the family. About fifty men continued
the- search all yesterday afternoon and to
day frequent additions swelled the num
ber to a thousand. The child's shoes were
found near the house, but the little fellow
has dropped out of sight so completely
that, although hardly a foot of ground
within a mile of the Pereira dwelling has
not been passed over, the hunt has
proved absolutely futile.
Opinion differs as to the babe's fate.
Some believe it has crawled into the high
grain In some neighboring field. Others be
lieve that the child was stolen. As the
parents are poor and know of no enemies,
no motive for kidnaping can be assigned.
A reward of $300 has been offered for in
formation leading to the recovery of the
baby. . Â¦â¢ Â¦-Â¦*Â£Â¦ "'Â¦ ?
Pereira is a farmer residing near St.
John. His infant was cutting childisn
pranks before a visitor at the farm yes
terday forenoon. When the dinner bell
rang this man responded to the call, leav
ing the baby at the gate. The little fel
low was barefooted and carried his shoes
in his hand. A few minutes later one of
Pereira's little girls was sent out to
bring the child in to dinner. She returned
and reported that she could find no trace
of ths baby.
WILLOWS, May 20.â One thousand men
have spent the day searching the hills of
Northern Butte County for trace of the
two-and-a-hal'-year-old child of - John
Pereira, who disappeared from St. John
yesterday. The searchers include contin
gents from Willows, Chico, St. John, Or
land and all the country hereabouts. They
have traversed neld and range, hill and
dale, so thoroughly that it would seem al
most impossible that the child should not
have been seen by some one; but late to
night, when most of the searchers re
turned home to await the coming of the
morrow, not the slightest trace of the
little one had been found. Several hun
dred men are still afield continuing the
hunt, while the exhausted parties that
have been out all day get a little rest.

Again a turn was made seaward, and as it was seen that the
wind had shifted the danger from St. Pierre, we ran back to the
landing. A party of sailors went ashore and brought off the
body. We returned then to Fort de France, where all was
panic. .
Terrible as was the eruption that came last night, it was mild
in comparison with that which occurred early this morning.
At half-past 5 o'clock a thick, heavy cloud, lit up by flashes
of lightning and the rising sun, rose from Mont Pelee. The
people of Fort de France at once became panic-stricken and
in scant attire rusted excitedly through the streets of the
town. Stones from\the volcano as big. as hazel nuts fell in the
streets. . Many of the inhabitants, hurriedly embarked on ;the
vessels in the Harbor, Wid it was with difficulty that they were
eventually reassured. \\t 7 o'clock,, however, the excitement
was over and the people became calm.
Owing to the hast\ retreat that was made from the British
consulate the body of T\lr. Japp/ which had been coffined, was
not recovered. It is now\deemed too dangerous v ; a task to, re
turn for, the body, which lies about a mile back from the shore.
Many, of the refugeesVnd a large proportion. of the inhab
itants of Fort de France slept last night at the water's edge.
\
When the Potomac had been put beyond the apparent dan
ger an observation was taken. Then the ship was- turned up the
coast arid was run close in under the column of death. As close
as the ship could be sent without courting destruction the Po
tomac went to the stream of lava. All about us the sea was
boiling, and the steam that came up over the sides was so
dense as to make it all but impossible to see through.
Several new craters seemed to have been formed and from
these lava was flowing down to the ocean. As the molten mass
joined the water great clouds of steam were raised and the sin
ister hissing could be heard amid the roar of the eruption.
Finally. the distance was covered and at the end it was dis
covered that, after all, the body would have to be temporarily
abandoned. Heavy seas were sweeping shoreward." It was
with great difficulty that the party was taken on board* by the
Potomac; but it was accomplished safely and just in time.
Straight out to sea for five jniles ran the Potomac while all eyes^
watched the eruption â the grandest and most awe-inspiring
sight ever witnessed "by man. There was an inner cofumn of fire
that reached perpendicularly into the air. About it was a funnel
shaped mass, of ashes and gas that could be penetrated by the
eye only when the flames burned brightest.
Half a mile was covered in this manner, each minute the
sky darkening. The heat was. beyond comprehension. In the
air was volcanic dust that made respiration hard labor.
His fellows had spirit enough to greet this sentiment with
a cheer. It was heartening, and it served to shame the French
men into a show of bravery. As rapidly as possible the sailors
made their way over the debris to the shore. Once one of them
stumbled. His fellows waited until he could recover himself,
when all went on together, still bearing the encoffinedLbody of
the Consul.
were saved. The ashes, gases, smoke and stones, instead of
pouring immediately upon us, were carried out over the sea.
Working among the ruins were a few Frenchmen^ who had re
mained ashore after their fellows had fled in fright. These men
became panic-stricken. They fell upon their knees and prayed
to be saved from the destruction which they feared was about
to fall upon them. They were in hysteria. Not one of the
Frenchmen was not in tears. Under the circumstances the pres
ence of mind and bravery of the American sailors was worthy of
the greatest praise. They refused to put down their burden.
"If we die," one of them said, "we will die with this body on
our shoulders."

People Get Willful.
"I earnestly entreat all coffee drinkers
to change to Postum. What is the use
of suffering day and, night because of
come paltry coffee when one has but to
leave it off and use Postum to be well?
And I think any one will agree with me
that health Is worth everything else;
morey. property or fame." Name given

"She said a lot more, and when I went
home I got a box of Postum and began
using it. Such a soothing effect took
place and I began sleeping nights and
felt a relief from my awful nervous ten-
sion. Gradually and surely I got well
and now I feel as strong and healthy as
a woman should at my age, with all my
old-time energy restored.
"She said: 'Five years ago I was af-
fected much, as you are, but I quit drink-
ing ceffee and began using Postum Food
Coffee, and that produced the result you
pee and restored me to health.'
"One day while visiting a minister's
wife, a motherly' old lady, she proposed
to give me a cup of coffee, the kind she
had been using three times a day for
three years. So she brought out a cup
of the most fragrant, delicious beverage.
It was coffee and it was not coffee.. I
tried it and was eager to know how 1t
was made.
"My stomach was in dreadful shape and
I was unable to sleep at night, nervous
prostration set in and I became barely
able to drag about.
"One physician advised me to quit cof-
fee and I tried quitting by the use of will
power, but every time It was a mlserablÂ©
failure.
A lady says: "Why will people wait as
long as I did when it is so easy to save
oneself the suffering caused by coffee
drinking? After using ' coffee several
years I discovered that I was breaking
down nervously. I consulted several doc-
tors, but in spite of everything steadily
srrt-w worse.

To Prove What the Great Kidney Remedy, Swamp-foot, Will Do
for YOU Every Reader, of The Call May Dave a Sample
Bottle Sent Absolutely Free by Mail.
It used to be considered that only urin-
ary and bladder troubles were to be
traced to the kidneys, but now modern
science proves that nearly all diseases
have their beginning in the disorder of
these .most important organs.
The kidneys filter and purify the blood-
that is their work.
Therefore, when your kidneys are weak
or out of order you i can understand how
quickly your entire body is affected and
how every organ seems .to fail to do its
duty. ' - â¢ - '
If you are sick or "feel badly" begin
taking the great kidney remedy. Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, because as soon as
your kidneys are well they will help all
the other organs to health. A trial will
convince any one.
â¢Weak and unhealthy kidneys are re-
sponsible* for many kinds of diseases, and
if permitted to continue much suffering,
â¢with' fatal results,' is sure to follow. Kid-
ney trouble irritates the nerves, makes
you dizzy, restless, sleepless and irritable.
Makes you pass water often during the
day, and obliges you to get up many
times during the night. Unhealthy kid-
neys cause rheumatism, gravel, catarrh
of the bladder, pain or dull ache in the
back, joints and muscles; makes your
head ache and back ache, causes indiges-
tion, stomach and liver trouble; you get
a sallow, yellow complexion; -makes you
feel as though you had heart trouble; you
may have plenty of ambition, but no
strength; get weak and waste away.
'The cure for these troubles is Dr. Kil-
mer's Swamp-Root, the world-famous
kidney remedy. In taking Swamp-Root
you afford .â¢ natural help to nature, for
Swamp-Root is the most perfect healer
and gentle aid to the kidneys that is
known to medical science.
If there is any doubt in .your mind as
to your condition take from your urine on
rising about four ounces, place it in a
glass or bottle and let . it stand twenty-
four hours. If on examination it is milky
or cloudy, if there is a brickdust settling,
or if small particles float about in it, your
kidneys are in need of immediate atten-
tion. . â¢ Â¦ ;:S:- <
I Swamp-Root is. pleasant to take and is
used in the leading hospitals, recommend-
ed by physicians in their private practice
and Is taken by doctors .themselves who
have kidney ailments, because they recog-
nize in it the greatest and most successful
remedy for kidney, liver and bladder
troubles. : Â¦. v Â¦ â¢"
If yon are . already convinced that
Swamp-Root Is what you need, you can
purchase the regular. 50-cent' and $1 size
bottles at the drugstores everywhere.
Don't make any mistake, but remember
the. name, Swamp-Root. 'Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, and the address, Bingham-
ton, N. Y., on every bottle. â¢ (Swamp-Root Is pleasant to^take.) -
EDITORIAIi NOTEâ If you have the slightest symptoms of kidney or blad-
der troubles, or if there is a trace of it in your family history, send at once to Dr.
Kilmer & Co., Binghamton, N. Y., who will gladly send you by mall, Immedlate-

night: 1 "The articles of agreement as
signed in New York must stand. These
include a clause that, the contest-is to go
to the club making the highest bid and
that soft surgical bandages be allowed. I
shall v bring up this latter point before a
bid is opened, and if Jeffries will not agree
to it I wilt-not remain at the meeting. I
will leave at once for New York and will
then go to England and fight the winner
of the Ruhlin-Sharkey contest.
It is not "expected the' local -clubs will
bid more -than 76 per cent. This would
yield ?26,250 as the fighters' share of a
$35,000 gate, which they -are expected to
draw: The" former, bid. was 70 -per cent,

While it was an easy matter to produce
the evidence of frauu in the use of epike
heads in place of whole spikes and of
utilizing second-hand lumber, it is im
possible to prove at this time that Norton
and Wakefield allowed concrete to be
dumped into cylinders filled witn water
in the last six weeks. The cylinders are
now filled with concrete and it is a ques
tion of veracity as to the manner in wmch
they were filled.
Though Norton claims the cylinders
were pumped down to the 22-foot level,
and even if he gets Wakefield and his
men to bolster ud his claim, the charge
is made that the structures were not
pumped as required If Norton and any
others still assert that the cylinders were
pumped out the statements are false and
the iren who make them know that they
8 re false.'
Chief Engineer Norton, who holds his
position by the grace of Governor Gage.
Billy Herrin and Dan Burns, has altered
specifications without â¢ any authority.
By doing so he has allowed Contractor
Waksf.eld to save large sums of money
en labor and material.
If President Kiiburn had witnessed the
manner in which the work of Wakefield
has been carried on in the last six weeks
h : would be forced to admit that in the
building of the new wharves a gigantic
fraud is beinje practiced, a steal of pub
lic funds being made, anC that Chief En
gineer Norton should be removed from
his position, which he only holds by the
prace of the political triumvirate. Gage,
Burns and Herrin. " *
The work on the wharves has been
watched for six . weeks only. Just how
Chief Engineer Norton juggled with
specifications previous to that time and
allowed Contractor Wabefiold to increase
his profits is kno-wn to them alone.
THEFT OF PUBLIC FUNDS.
â¢'This is an outrage." declared President
lvilburn with warmth. "It is a fraud on
tne Harbor Commissioners and we will
sift this whole matter to the bottom. I
will consult with my colleagues and we
will take the proper steps.' 1
President Kiiburn asked Assistant En
gineer Kyan if he oould account for the
naud taking place, but that official said
that Inspector Hugh Duff ought to have
detected it. Then it transpired that Dutf
was inspecting other work at the time
mat me bogus spikes were used in the
planking. Those who watched the fraud
mtnt work done some weeks ago saw an
official of the Harbor Commission ac
company the foreman for the contractor
and give the spike heads to a workman
and order him to use them on the plank
ing. \
Kiiburn was also shown the
second-hand lumber that Contractor
Wakefield put into one of the wharves.
The lumber had been used before and
was bcred through in places and had oid
spikes in it. Tne explanation of Chief
Engineer Norton is tnat Wakefield had
used the lumber in the "false work" and
had then placed it permanently in tne
wharf fenders. This is not only a viola
tion of the specifications, but a fraud on
the State. Chief Engineer Norton will
have a hard time to prove to the Harbor
Commissioners his right to change speci
fications.
"The commission has no right to change
specifications," said President Kiiburn,
"and Norton had no right' to. do so.
Changing specifications opens the door to
fraud and with the evidence just pre
sented to me I am forced to believe some
of the testimony of The Call representa
tives on other charges."
lEAUD, SAYS KTLBTJRN.
Evidence of frai id in the building of the
new wharves on ft ie water front was yes
terday presented U> President Paris Kil
burn ol the Harbor CommiBsibners and
that official declan-d in emphatic terms
that the board woul.d make a rigid inves
tigation of the chars-is made by The Call
against Contractor Vakelield and Chief
Engineer L. D. Norton.
On Monday last, wtuen President Kil
burn was interviewed as to the expose
made by The Call of the changing* of
i,peeincations by Chief Engineer Norton
and the flimsy work being caxied on by
Contractor Wakefield, Kilburu' stated that
be could not possibly believe the charges
to "3e true. .
"In the matter of the spikeheads, which
The Call charges were driven into the
pianking of one ox the wharves, it they
can be shown to me, I will be prepared to
taint. " he said. â¢ â¢ '
President Kiiburn yesterday visited one
of the wharves with representatives of
'ihe Call. He was asked to order a cer
tain plank to be taken up, being told he
would rind broken spekeheads driven into
il in place of sound spikes.
Kiiburn cailed Assistant Engineer Ryan
and ordered that tlie plaiik be taken up.
'A wo laborers quickly pried it up and
broken spikeheads were found to have
Leen driven into it in place of souna
epik.es. A secend plaJik was then taken
up and again the evidence of fraud was
discovered. . *

TUGBOAT WHICH RAN OVER
A SLEEPING WHALE LAST
SUNDAY.
Captain Dave STiaw of the tugboat Reliance
ran into a sleeping whale on Sunday afternoon
off Point Diablo. The shock Jarred the tow
boat, but the whale cÂ°t the worst of the en
counter an<2 was probably cut to pieces by the
Reliance'* propeller. Tlje Reliance and Alert
Â«er* returnine from s;a after bavine towed
cut the shla Emi'.y F. Whitney. As the Re
liance was rounding Point Diablo,' Captain
Â£haw, who was In the wheelhou^e, felt a heavy-
Jar and for awhile thought the boat had struck
a rock. He stopped the engines. Astern of
the boat he saw en the surface of the water a
patch of blood. Going back to investigate he
found mixed with the blood huge slabs of flesh
that resemb!ed whale blubber. The blood
j.atch extended for quite a distance and there
was a lance quantity of the chopped-up blub
ber floating in thÂ» vicinity. Of the whale itself
Fhaw saw nothing. He thinks the leviathan
must have been sleeping, that it was dis
turbed by the towboat sliding across its back
End started to rise in time to get into trouble
with the rapidly revolving propeller. Judg

' rioted tissue. Shaw is of the opinion that the

Dr. Cummings said yesterday that there
was no doubt whatever as to the cause
of Herdman's death, that there was no
other sickness on board and that although
proper precaution demanded the detention
of \Jtie passengers and crew he did not
anticipate any further trouble. Â» The pas
sengers will be released on Sunday.

taken sick down the coast and died about
a week ago. He was buried at sea. He
was about 28 years old and had been in
the Mall Company's service four years.
He was considered a verv valuable clerk
and was in line for early: promotion. He
lived in this city with his aged mother.
:o whose support he was the sole con
tributor.

when Dr. Cummlngs of the Fed
eral quarantine boarded her he found
that yellow fever had been on board and
claimed one victim, W. J. Herdman, a
freight clerk. After satisfying himself
that yellow fever had been beyond ques
tion the cause of death. Dr. Cummings
ordered that the passengers and crew bc
landed^ with their baggage, at Angel Isl
and and that the veesel be taken to the
fumigating hulk for disinfection. The
passengers and crew will be detained five
days in quarantine. The vessel will be
turned over to the Pacific Mail Company

One of the tricks of the Gage manage
ment in the, San Jose campaign' was the
use cf promises concerning the Big Basin
Park. Governor j Gage has, during the
past few weeks, and in fact ever since the
campaign' at San Jose opened, been say
ing that he found' the San Jose people
strongly in favor of the park. His fol
lowers went a step farther and promised
that the deal for; the sale of the lands
to be included In the park would be closed
this week, or directly after the election.
A San Francisco business man received a
letter a few days before the election from
Andrew P. Hill. of San Jose, in which the
statement was made that the deal would
probably be closed this week. Hill is one
of the prime' movers, for the Big. Basin
Park and he seemingly was led into be
lieving that "the promises of the Gage
'management at; San Jose relative to the
park would be speedily fulfilled.
The. fact is that no titles to land have

Among the British there are reported to be/two N ,
viewsâ one in - favor of /continuing the fight until â¢ the
Boers yield in an unconditional surrender, the other,
advocating, a "grant: of liberal terms so" that the con-'
"â¢It is. further stated ' that wh'ile the Transvaal men
are eager for peace, the men of Orange Free State
are sullen and unwilling, to surrender.
Not long ago the London Telegraph obtained
from its correspondent at Klerksdorp a report of in
formation-gained by interviews with Boer delegates
assembled there to discuss peace propositions. In
the course of his report he says the Boer's concede
that the two republics ' must pass under the sover
eignty of Great Britain, but demand that they.be
"reconstructed under the British flag as self-govern
ing states within a specified period. The time limit
for reconstruction is to be one year, and there is to'
be no disfranchisement interposed against those
who have taken up arms. -A further consideration is
that a " sum of money sufficient to rebuild the de
stroyed farms and to fairly restock them should be
granted. The amount is variously estimated at one
to triree. millions sterling. Another, and equally
specific term 16 that there shall be immunity given
to all rebels, Cape, Natal or others, and to all per
sons who bore arms against the" British; that no
penal proceedings shall be taken against 'them, and
that they shall not be otherwise molested. or, debarred
the enjoyment of any civic rights and. privileges con
ceded to their fellow^burghers."
So strict has been the British censorship upon re
ports from South Africa that very little reliable-in
formation has been made public concerning the
terms offered by either party. The length ot time
occupied in the negotiations, however, is enough to
render it certain that the original propositions of
the two "parties were radically different from one an
other, and that ; a great deal of difficulty has been
found in arranging a basis of agreement ..
REPORTS that British officers and agents in
this, country have been instructed to make no
further purchases of horses or mules for use
in South Africa go far to confirm the belief that the
chances of peace between the British and the Boers
are much better than has been given out in Parlia
ment. There is of course a desire on the part of the
Ministry to begin retrenching expenditures as soon
as possible, but at the same time they would not un
dertake it at the expense of the army unless. they
were much more sure of a termination of hostilities
than they pretend to be in their official utterances.
PEA0E NEGOTIATIONS.
How vast the change has been appears in the
statement that these visiting business men will be
shown in Tulare County 5000 acres of- citrus ; ar- .
chards, ; growing and. bearing in a -belt that runs like
a broad ribbon from Porteryille three hundred miles
north to Oroville. On that belt will grow oranges
more excellent than the fruit of Sicily and in an
abundance that will fill tens, of thousands of cars and
supply not only the, American market but send to
Europe a surplus that will make the orange common
to the foreign consumer, as .it has never been made
by the* orchards of Italy and of Spain. '"':'
But Tulare does not carry all her eggs in one bas
ket. The, San Francisco merchants will .see there
prune orchards that have a record "of half ; a ton : of
fruit per tree, the finest Â¦ nectarines ,in the , world,
peaches andpears, ."figs more luscious ; than : the
Greeks feed on, 1 dairies that produce butter that is,
scented by.- the r ambrosial forage browsed by : the
cows, ' and cheese that is ' pressed cream. jThey will
seeithe headed grain billowing in the wind, and high
above it all the majestic mountains wearing an im
perial crown. of snow, with their cheeks; bearded by,
the forest of big "trees that shade , the trickling;

Then Visalia was a sort of cowboy, capital. The

In the past few weeks the Big Basin
Park Commissioners have made some
progress. An opinion has been secured
from the Attorney General of the State
in "which the power of the commission to
hypothecate the .entire appropriation for
the purchase 'of park lands was- affirmed.
The. owners of 'lands in the Big Basin
have ; about Â¦ concluded that there is no
great thing for them In the price that the
S|ate will pay for their holdings. Various
concessions have been made by them to
the commission and the tract that may be
finally accepted will -probably embrace
nearer. 3500 than 2500 acres. The original
proposition -of the lumber men was to
absorb 1 the entire appropriation of $250,000
for 2500 acres, or just one-half the size of
the tract that the Legislature was assured
by the Sempervirens Club was the lowest
limit acceptable for park uses.
when they willbe. The Governor has no
power to put the park project through
without the co-operation of his associates
in the Big Basin Park Commission and
they are inclined to go slowly, as past
events have abundantly demonstrated
Consequently any .promise - that Gage
would hasten the de'al for the park was a
Case of false pretenses, pure and simple?.

SANTA ROSA, May 20.â The jrive
nile floral carnival in this city on
Saturday, May 31, bids fair to be
one of the most elaborate flower
fetes ever witnessed in the north
ern, section of California. The affair is
under the auspices of the Women's Im

Park will be the scene 'of the festivities.
The feature of the measure we have just pointed
out is but one of its many evils. Were it the only
one, however, it would be enough to condemn tf.
The average duration of human life is but thirty-five
years, so that the average man has but fourteen
years of life as a voter. It will be seen that should
this amendment be carried the average, voter would
have but a slim chance of ever getting a vote in the
selection of the three men who are to control the
commission and virtually dominate the common
wealth so far as its dealings with corporations are
concerned. In fact, the amendment is .all for the
commission. - The voters are not in it
It is to be borne in mind that the amendment was
carried through both branches of the Legislature by
trick and deceit worked out in secrecy. The same
tactics are to be employed in the effort to get it
adopted by the people. The bosses who are working
for the amendment do not discuss it. They make no
attempt to defend it They do not so much as- at
tempt to excuse it. Their programme of action is
to keep silent and avoid arousing the public. It is

successors of those men to continue their power for
sixteen years, or possibly for twenty years. Short
of a demand for absolute power the corporations
could hardly ask for more than what Gage's amend
ment scheme purposes to give them.
Those three Commissioners will form a majority
of the board, and by combining they can govern it.
Their act will be the actlof the commission. Gage
can put those men in power, one for six, one for
eight and one for ten years. It will be a cinch for
the corporations. They will have only to bring
about by intrigue of corruption the election of the
Commissioner for ten years; when that term is over
his successor will be elected for. ten years; thus in
that district the people will have a chance to elect
a Commissioner just once in twenty years. For the
Commissioner . from the district represented by
Gage's appointee for eight years, the people will
have but one vote in eighteen years. For the Com
missioner for the six-year term the people will have
but one chance to vote in sixteen years.
After the terms of the first appointees are ended
each succeeding Commissioner is to hold office for
ten years. We have this prospect for the
\-oters: From one district Gage will appoint a
It is provided that: "The members of the com
mission in the first instance shall be appointed by
the Governor, one from each district, and the Gov
ernor shall designate one thereof to hold office for
two years, one for four years,' one for six years, one
for eight years and one for ten years; and in mak
ing such appointments the Governor shall not ap
point more than three Commissioners from any one
political party." As it is further provided "that the
act of the majority of the Commissioners shall be
deemed to be and shall be the act of the commis
sion," it will be seen that the Governor can appoint
three -men chosen not merely, from his own party,
but from his own faction, who will control the com
mission for at least six years.
If the amendment be adopted the term of the
Commissioners will begin on the first Monday after
the first day of January succeeding the election, and
consequently Gage will have the power of. appoint
ing them.
GAGE'S scheme for setting the corporations of
the State above the people through the me
dium of Assembly constitutional amendment
No. 28 is worth studying in detail. It has wheels
within wheels and each wheel is a buzzsaw for the
people. Should it be adopted the voters of the
State would be put out of business so far as " the
regulation of corporations is Â¦ concerned, for they
would have little or nothing to do in the selections
of the Commissioners provided for by the amend
ment, who are to have exclusive jurisdiction and
power over all the relations of the corporations to
the people.
SLIM CHANCES- FOR VOTERS.
The subject is interesting as an illustration of the
rapidity with which the movement toward -the con
solidation of corporate interests is going on. It has
long been' a foregone conclusion that the steam rail
ways of the country will eventually co-operate in
stead of competing with one another, - and now it
seems that in thickly' settled localities street railways
will- be consolidated with the steam, lines. Broadly
speaking the issue. is one of concern to the whole
country/ and. the Massachusetts experiment will be
watched with close attention by all who are inter
ested in railway developments. V . :
It appears the .steam railways of Massachusetts
have for a long time ignored the rapid development
of the electric lines, but can no longer afford to do
so. -In some cases their local traffic has been almost
taken away from them. The bill now under consid
eration would give them the privilege of â¢buying up
the competing. lines and making use of them as
feeders for the steam roads. It is believed the service
on both kinds of 'roads' would: be. improved by" the
combination and the "public convenience benefited.
As an outcome of the .competition there is now
before the Massachusetts Legislature a bill providing
that "a railroad corporation may, subject to the ap
proval of the Board 1 of Railroad Commissioners,
subscribe for, purchase, own, invest in and. hold any
shares of the capital stock of any, street railway
company, and may vote on all shares of stock so sub
scribed for, purchased, "owned, invested- in or held
by it." . .
Commenting upon. fhe -bill the Boston Transcript
says its passage "would 'settle, the question whether
or not; the street railways of the commonwealth are
to be developed into a system of rapid-service, long
distance lines, with their smaller lines acting as feed
ers of their trunk lines, or whether the street rail
ways shall become feeders of the steam railroads, fol
lowing the policy which has been pursued in Con
necticut"! . : ; ; , . Â¦Â¦.â¢'. ...
To the people of California, such, questions at this
time are not , practical. It â¢ is still a long time be
fore we are to have any serious problem of that kind
to solve. ' To New England,- however,, they; are very
practical questions indeed. In that thickly settled
section of the country . electric suburban lines have
already become strong rivals to the steam roads," and
in some respects they even threaten to supplant them.
>->HALL the railroads of the future be operated
by steam or by electricity? Will the competition
between electric lines and steam lines end in
the domination of. city and suburban railways by the
great companies controlling the steam roads, or will
the electric lines develop into formidable - ; com
petitors with the steam lines even in long distance
hauling? â¢ . â¢ , \' Â¦
STEAM OR ELECTRICITY.
One of the encouraging features of the times in
local affairs.is the fact that most of the members of
our footpad fraternity who are caught are pleading
guilty. Our Judges should keep up their excellent
work of giving the rascals all they deserve. Â¦ .
In these days when the rights of the strong are
vaunted as the only rights of the world it is a stirring
spectacle to see a physically -weak people,' few in
numbers, strong only in purpose and great in their
love of self-government, take their- place among the
nations with a sovereignty that is the equal in dig
nity of the oldest and proudest of the nations of the
earth. Americans who comprehend clearly the mis
sion of their own country rejoice with a great joy as
their own flag is furled over Morro Castle and' the
bright banner of a new republic takes its place.
They have neither hatred nor gratitude to express
toward Spain, but exulted in their own enfranchise
ment. Though Wfe are distant from the scene of
their emergence into liberty, -the American pulse
quickens in contemplating it. The- church bells
tolled a requiem for all the patriots who perished in
the long combat against power and oppression.
Marti and Garcia were not forgotten, and. they and
all. the dead were blessed by the prayers of patriots.
The free people marched to the fortress Cabanas and
stood upon the spot Where patriot prisoners had been
manacled and shot, and where the daily slaughter had
reddened the ground with the blood of men and
boys whose crime was love of country. They were
a nameless host of martyrs. They died in despair.
Their last look was upon a land where power knew
no mercy and the greatest crime was patriotism.
Forlorn and friendless they perished. But their
grateful countrymen, exulting in the liberty of
which their v blood Was the chrism, did . not forget
them, and the place of the death was crowned with
flowers and hallowed by grateful tears.
The Cuban people have been reared and schooled
in that subserviency to a dynasty and to a regal au
thority which assumed to permit them to live and
imperfectly enjoy that which proceeded from their
own toil and strength. It is high evidence of their
spirit and of the force of our near-by example that
they cast off this spirit of dependence and submis
sion and look themselves in the face as the owners
of the island and the source of all that it has been
made to bear and to be.
A San Francisco gentleman who recently spent
some time abroad was one day riding in one of the
fine parks in Vienna. The driver was evidently im
pressed by the American's admiration of the beauti
ful grounds,. and said to him: "It is very kind of the
Emperor to permit his people to enjoy this park.
He is very good to his people." I'he answer was a
clear-cut American expression to the effect that the
people were very kind to the Emperor, because they
permitted him to live in splendor in a palace which
they provided and to pretend ownership of their
parks and places, which he could. not create- nor care
for. Â¦ Â¦ ' â¢ 'Â¦ ' .' ' â¢" .
Patriotism is the cementing principle of all repub
lics. It is that love of country which has no relation
to parties, nor dynasties, but regards them as pass
ing and impermanent things, while the land' arid the
people whom' it nourishes from generation to genera
tion are the objects of popular love and solicitude. "
The new republic begins . with an effusion of
patriotic feeling worthy of the people who know the
cost of liberty and the watchfulness that must main
tain it. -The honor paid to the patriot dead, to those
who long ago were martyred in what seemed a vain
struggle, and to the living 'who staked a all 'that men
have to give, for freedom, is a most wholesome evi
dence of a patriotic spirit that will endure and grow
stronger with time.
IT" is a source of gratification to all Americans and
to all lovers of liberty throughout the world that
Cuba has at last taken her place among -the na
tions. In this country it is a subject that will al
ways be remembered with pride, because of thehigh
part taken in this great event by our own Govern
ment and people. Without that Cuba would to-day
be a gasping victim impaled upon a spear. We may
well forget some errors* in policy, and some expres
sions of. selfishness that have appeared among* our
selves which seemed^ to indicate. ulterior motives at
war with our expressed purpose when we intervened
between Spain and the island. , <

Special Dispatch to The CalL
FOLSOM, May 20.â The investigation
into the conduct of the Folsom Prison on
May 24 Is awaited with much interest by
the citizens of Folsom and the attaches of
the institution. Convict Raymond, WaB
den Wilkinson's secretary, is charged by
the officials with watching their move
ments and reporting them to the Warden.
Guards, as well as prisoners, are out
spoken regarding the food served them in
the prison. The' former claim, that they
have to come to Folsom to get a "square
meal," and some procure their own sup
plies and cook them In their rooms. | j
Former Guard Cann makes a serious
allegation against Warden Wilkinson.
Cann says the Warden disliked Convict
Olden, who had charge of the dairy sup
plies. Cann says Wilkinson told hint that
there was three' pounds of opium in the
safe and ordered him to sell it to Olden.
Wilkinson, . Cann alleges, explained that
he would have an officer hold up Olden
and find the opium upon his person, and
the board of directors would then remove
Olden's credits, forcing him to serve hi*
full sentence. Cann- is a resident of Fol-
Bom. He declares he will substantiate his
statements with other witnesses if the,
board of directors request his presence at
the investigation. ' i,
During the investigation, it 13 said. Con
vict Brock Smith will be brought before
the board to show the effects of the iiv
human strait-jacket, a mode of ounisti
ment instituted by Warden Wilkinson:
Smith -is alleged to have been laced until
he could hardly breathe and left unon the
floor of a cell for eighteen hours. Prior to
this punishment he was considered one of
the strongest men in the prison; now, it la
said, he is a physical wreck.
Many of the prison employes have mail
boxes in Folsom, giving as a reason that
convicts have been detected handling their
letters. r'-

LOSES .SUIT FOR OFFICE.
-,The claims of the members of the board
were assigned to Catesby -C Thom, who
in&tituted suit to recover the amount of
their several salaries. A. demurrer wa3
interposed . by the defense on the ground
that the complaint did not state facts suf
ficient to constitute cause of action. The
lower court sustained the demurrer and
Thom appealed. to the Supreme Court, re
fusing to amend the complaint.
The attorneys for the county contended
in'answer to the appeal that the law was
illegal in that its provisions conflicted
with those of a section of the constitu
tion wheh names county officers in re
spect to whose emoluments the Legisla
ture may have supervision. It was
claimed that the members of Boards of
Education were not county officers. "
The Supreme Court maintains that there
Is no necessity for passing upon the con
stitutionality of the law in the present
instance. In reference to the appeal It is
decided that* the complaint stated facts
sufficient to constitute cause of action
and the lower court is accordingly di
rected to overrule the demurrer and pro
ceed with the case. â¢
The Supreme (Court decided yesterday
that the. officials of Los Angeles County
had no right to refuse to pay members of
the County Board of Education the sal^
ary prescribed by. the Legislature. The
settlement of this dispute affects the
other counties of the State. The law di
rects that in counties of. the class of Los
Angeles the members of the Boards of
Education shall receive $5 for each day of
service. Such payment was refused in
the case at bar on the ground that the
law is unconstitutional.

At, a regular meeting of the Roosevelt
Republican Club of the Forty-second As
sembly District, held last evening, Presi
dent George B. Wells in the chair and'E.
G. Knapp secretary, the following resolu
tions were unanimously adopted: ;
FORTY-SECOND DISTRICT.
WRECK OF THE MACHINE.
s The talk that George A. Knight will
become the. residuary legatee; of Gage's
political fortune is at least premature.
Knight is known to be next, to Gage. On
the original boss programme -the ex
orator wasV slated for chairman of the
convention, but the programme was made
before the people began to acclaim â¢ Lieu
tenant Governor Neff chairman. Mayor,
Schmitz remarks that the Hon. Jacob H.
Neff is a grand pioneer, a' noble man, and
should be chosen, to preside over the
State There are predictions
that the noble pioneer may be called on
to preside over the entire State. The race
for Governor is wide open for. all as
pirants. The wreck of the boss machine
in San Jose' adds" to the strength of
Colenel E. F. Preston, Mayor Schmitz, E.
B. Edson, Dr. Pardee, < Thomas Flint,
Frank H. Short and W. M. Cutter. Veter
ans belonging to the Grand Army talk of
putting forward Adjutant General Stone.
The Democrats are quiet. "When the in
dications pointed to Gage's renomination
there was great activity in the Democrat
ic camp.. A dozen aspirants for the first
place on the State ticket were' clamoring
for recognition. The universal, impression
that anybody could beat Gage accounted
for the desire to run against him. As re
cent events signify that Gage's candidacy
i3 obsolete the statesmen of the Demo
cratic faith are not eo anxious to lead
their. party in the coming campaign. As
a last ; resort the Democrats could fall
back on Tom Geary, the Hearst candidate
for Governor. ;. Â¦ : , ."
Wherever a town is big enough to have labor
unions Mayor 1 Schmitz has the influence.
Schmitz is ; the cause of Johnny's defeat. The
same thing will happen in Sacramento.' .--/,.â¢
It is common political gossip that
Burns and Billy Herrin will soon haul off
Gage. The coming ex-Governor -is known
to be- a rampant kicker and bucker when
the programme is not to his liking, but
the old-time political experts in the boss
camp Eay that he can be cured of his
kicking spells. '. â¢ â¢) ,-
Major â¢ McLaughlin was somev.hat
amused yesterday when Eddie Conroy
gave him this greeting: "I congratulate
you, major, on your telegram - to the
Hayes-vbrothers over the result of the
San Jose election.". -It -now transpires
that -Major McLaughlin was In close
touch with the San Jose Good Govern
ment leaders for some weeks prior. to the
election. . . ,,~ -,['/':. â¢' ,
The stragglers of. thvfour hundred that
v/ent down to San- Jose to help Gags are
returning singly and in' groups. Last
night Jesse Marks, weary and demoral
ized, showed up at his saloon on Market
street. He was somewhat dazed, like the
soldiers of Napoleon in the retreat from
Moscow. The ex-boss of- the Fortieth
Assembly ;. District ascribes Mackenzie'*
undoing to Mayor Schmitz. A remark of
Jesse Marks is this: . : .: .
RETBEAT FROM SAN JOSE.
Goldberg was formerly on the Yosemite
Valley Commission, and while- the great
dome is not a monument to his ottlcial
integrity, the fact that it is still there,
unshaven, Is cited as proof that he does
not shave everything in sight. In a'spir
ited contest last August for th.e honor of
representing the Republicans of his dis
trict in a local nominating convention
Goldberg was defeated. There is a fine
field in Napa County, for the display of
his political dexterity. When'he get3 to
the asylum and meets Dr. f Hennessy
there will be two Gage men in Â¦ the
county. â¢ - , - 0
Max Goldberg is appointed trustee of the
Napa Asylum for the" Insane, vice E. E.
Washburn of the clerical department of
the Supreme Court. Max has not had
much "recognition" of late years apart
from that which The Call generously be
stowed upon him when he acted as/ go
between for ex-Auditor Asa R. Wells and
W. F. Herrin, ex-attorney of the Market
street Railway. It will be recalled that
Wells did some prancing about because B.
P. Flint was not put on the push slate
for Supervisor. Wells one night In the
Pleasanton Hotel became so indignant
over the turning down of Flint that he
threatened to come off the ticket as can
didate for Mayor. The threat so alarmed
Max Goldberg that the latter posted in
hot haste to see Billy Herrin. In the
midst of the excitement Max lost his
presence of mind and rang up for a car
riage to convey him to Herrin s residence.
The Call, in accordance ' with its usual
custom of foreshadowing Gage's* im
portant appointments, mentioned .~\ last
week that Emerson had been slated
for Parker's- old - place. The in
telligence was also imparted that
Emerson had been recommended to
the unfortunate executive by J. C. Bull, a
former political boss of Humboldt County.
It is just possible that Gage and Bull
will shift the cut^and provide for Emer
son in some other pasture. Tt.e Governor
roared when The Call gave the news that
Mackenzie had been slated for Harbor
Commissioner. His Excellency even talk
ed of turning down Johnny, but Burns
would not listen to the suggesttbn. -

PATTOSIEN'S, '
Sixteenth and Mission.
There's only one thing'left for us to do and that is to throw this special*
stock on the market and realize what we can for it. The people of ..San'
Francisco are placed in the position of profiting from our misfortune, and
while they have been accustomed to enjoy at our hands an advantage of at
least 25 per cent less than the installment combine prices, yet rarely does
such an opportunity as the present one occur even in our establishment.
We must save our credit, and to do so the people of this city must use this
furniture that was intended for the homes of Oakland. 60 cents on the dollar
and less is what this money-raising sale means. . â¢
We hs.ve arranged to open a big branqfr house in Oakland, and supposed
we had so far perfected our plans that there could be.no chance of their fail-
ure. But we were wrong. Our architect failed us, and the store, instead of
being ready, cannot receive us until late in August. . In every other detail we
were ready for the opening, and now have <jji hand- the stock prepared for
the Oakland store,' amounting to over $85,000 of the newest and- most com-
plete stock of merchandise purchasable. We can't hold it until August be-
cause it must be paid for before that time.
Our present situation is, even for us, an unusual, one. We find our-
selves in a predicament that demands a quick solution." We invite your as-
sistance and co-operation in straightening out what has been to us an em-
barrassing event and what will prove to you a big money-saving oppor- ,
tunity. . ... *

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
NEW YORK. May 20.â Prices of stocks
scored quite a substantial recovery to-day and
ended the day pretty near the top level and
steady. There was a much more cheerful feel-
Ing with regard to the outlook for values and
none of the rather urgent pressure to sell which
was a feature yesterday. The sharp and sud
den declines among high-priced but seldom
active stocks gave place to equally sudden re
coveries in the same securities. International
Power recovered 5 points of its 18-potnt break
yesterday, and there were wide gains scored
by the electric and express stocks, which were
notable ' sufferers yesterday. There was not
much news on which to base the rise. Senti
ment was favorably affected by the large ab
sorption of United States Steel at rising prices.
This soothed all anxieties which were
caused by yesterday's rumors that a formid
able bear party had been formed in the stock
as an outgrowth of the criticism of the stock
conversion and bond issue plan. The notable
strength of Canadian Pacific and its subsidi
ary roads, Minneapolis. St. Paul and Sault
Ste. Marie and Duluth, South Shore and At
lantic, also had a notable sympathetic effect
on the whole market. This movement began
abroad before the opening here and was not
explained by .any specific news. London was
a buyer on a considerable scale after the holi
day, and confident predictions were beard that
peace would be declared at an early day In
South Africa. The formal announcement of
the terms' for taking over Jointly by Louisville
and Nashville and Southern Railway of Chi
cago, Indianapolis and Louisville stocks in re
turn for 4 per cent/ bonds was reflected in the
price for Louisville. The terms of exchange
for the 'stock at .78 for the common and 90 for
the preferred led to some recession in their
prices, as the joint bonds, judged by the prece
dent of the Burlington exchange bonds, are not
likely to command a full -par value. The pres
ence in the Wall street district of Secretary
Easley of the Civic Federation and his con
sultation with important- representatives of the
anthracite interests gave rise to conjectures
that measures were in progress for the settle
ment of the anthracite miners' strike. Wall
street opinion remains confident that a settle
ment lies within reach at almost any time.
There was also much less apprehension of a
spread of the labor trouble Into the bitumin
ous coal ' fields, ' which was considered a for
midable prospect yesterday. The buying of
stocks by London was a factor in the easier
tone of foreign exchange which relieved the
feeling yesterday that a prompt return of ex
change to the gold export level was to follow
the relaxation of money rates. Sugar was
helped by the reports of an agreement upon
a Cuban reciprocity measure, and Amalga
mated Copper was tirm on Ihe -better conditions
reported in the copper < trade. The market
closed quiet and steady.

much. Parturage is short for so early lii the
season.
are doinsr well. .Beans are in good condition in
SaÂ»;Ut Barbara County. Sucar . beets are In
fair Vondition. though needing rain. Walnuts
premise a good crop. In come sections decid
uous fruits are reported very heavy and thin
nine is necessary. Indications are very fa
vorable for a heavy yield of grapes.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA..â The showers
Tuttday night and Wednesday were too light
to benefit crops, -which -are -now . needing rain
badly. Late sown grain is reported in bad
condition, and the Â«Â»rly sown is being cut for
hay. The high winds- at the close of the week
have probably still further damaged the grain
crops apd deciduous' fruits. Haying is pro
presf-ing; Wpetables and other irrigated crops
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.â The rain on
Tuesday and Wednesday in the central and
northern districts was generally beneficial,
though it caused some damage to ripening
fruit end cut hay. High winds at the close
of the woek have probably been Injurious to
fruit and grain, but no estimates of the loss
have been received. The weather In other re
spects has ' been generally favorable for grow
ing crops, which are advancing satisfactorily.
There will be pood crops of grain except in
come of the southern counties. Haying con
tinues: the hay is reported of superior quality,
but the yield light In the smithern districts.
D^iduous fruits, except prunes, are in ex
cellent condition. The strawberry crop in So
noma County was badly damaged by recent
r&in. Vineyards are doinsr well.
EAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.â High winds at
the close of the week caused considerable dam
ape tc fruit, especially ripening cherries, and
pmbsbly Injured grain to some extent. The
rain en Tuesday extended through the valley,
snd was verv beneficial; cut hay was not se
riously damaged, but there will b* some loss.
In the southern counties some grain is being
cut for hay. and the wheat crop will be very
light, but in the central and northern districts
prospects continue good for abundant crops
of wheat and barley. Early wheat is turning
and barley is nearly ripe; harvest will com
mence soon In Madera County. The first crop
of alfalfa Is reported the heaviest ever known.
FRsturaire is plentiful. Deciduous fruits are
In excellent condition, with the exception of
pears in Tulare County, and good crops are
expected. Vineyards are thrifty.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY.â Rain at the bÂ«
ptenlng of the week was beneficial to crops
generally, but" damaged hay and ripe cher
ries. The high winds at close of the week
have doubtless caused considerable damage to
fruit, especially cherries, apricots and almonds.
A report from Wheatland states that wheat
beads appear very short, and the yield may not
exceed that of last year. Other sections report
that grain prospects were n*>ver better, and
heavy crops are expected. Hay harvest is pro
gressing, with good results. Hops are in ex
cellent condition. Deciduous fruits, where not
damaged by the recent rain and high winds,
are doing well and good crops are probable;
apricots are ripening rapidly. Cherries and
strawberries are abundant, and of excellent
quality.
Ar this report closes (Monday morning), high
wlr.de continue In the valleys and sandstorms
Vi the southern districts, probably causing
much damage to crops.
Ripe cherries were considerably damaged by
4he rain and wind, and apricots and other fruits
wer<> injured to come extent. The first crop of
etrawberries in Sonoma County was ruined by
the rain. Prunes, pears and apricots are re
ported dropping in many localities, but fair
crops are still probable. Walnuts and citrus
fruits are thrifty.
Â¦With few exceptions, grain is in excellent
condition in the central and northern portions
of the State, and prospects continue good for a
htavy yield of wheat and barley. Early bar
lf" is ripening and early sown grain is turn-
Ing in portions of the San Jo&quln Valley, and
harvest will commence soon If warm weather
prevails. In the southern part of the San
Joaquln Valley and nearly all parts of South
ern California the early sown grain crop Is a
failure and is being cut for hay; the late sown
is in very bad condition, and the yield will be
light. Hay harvest continues; the yield is good
and Quality excellent in most places. Some
cut hay was damaged by recent rains. Hops,
sugar boetn and beans are doing well. Pastur
es^ continues plentiful.
The temperature has been below normal In
nearly all parts of the State during the week.
Kain fell in the central and northern sections
and light showers in the south Tuesday and
Wednesday. High winds prevailed In all sec
tions at the close of the wÂ«Â«k.
GENERAL SUMMARY.
The weekly report of A. G. McAdle, section
director of the climate atid cr^p service tf the
Weather Bureau. Is as follows:
The Weather and Crops.
Another advance In Bran, and Middlings Is
noted, . and both ' are .very firm. ' .Â¦Â¦. Â¦ " Â¦ .
. Hay has turned quite firm during the past
several days', and quotations., for- the choicer
grades have advanced slightly. . Real ' choice
Hay Is getting scarce, and a car of extra fine
wheat sold yesterday at $13. I There are two
causes for the advance.; The' first is that the
small dealers have allowed 1 their stocks to run
down and are now buying freely to stock up
again; the second is that the crop is not look-
Ing, as well as if did a month ago, the staple
being short and thin on the ground, owing to
the very cool spring. There will- ' be crop
enough to satisfy 'the demand, without doubt,
but It will not be as heavy as anticipated some
weeks ago. . ,
A cargo of new Alfalfa. 1 the first of the sea

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
came when 'Â¦ it '.-. was apparent - that â¢ the .'. much
talked-of Increases ; in . cof rf receipts were not
to materialize at once. The general feeling: of
traders late in the .session was' that the big
manipulators ' had the crowd pretty well -short
and .could .pinch 4 it badly if -they -so desired.
July sold from -61V&C up' to 62%c and closed
strong : at 62oâ %@%c higher. Â¦ ,v â¢ i â¢ *
Wheat wag inclined to dullness all day, but
showed fair strength at times.'- The good grow
ing ' weather in .the Â¦ winter States, Â¦ absence of
Liverpool -. cables - and ' reports of more -liberal
cpunjry offerings started the crowd somewhat
bearish. Bull news,- : however, was in better
array, j . Receipts -were small ; there were very
heavy - rains Â¦ In * the -Northwest, which con
tinued to retard spring seeding and the visible
supply, decreased 2,204,000 bushels, where only
1,750,000 bushels decrease was expected. Re
ports fromÂ»the Red River 'Valley stated that
there; was but 35 per cent of last year's spring
acreage , seeded. : In the j main trade wfls dull.

by corn, mounted to- 75c. . Liquidation took oft

, The corn strength, .together. with some active
purchases by: the leading May hulls, sent oats

sued a new regulation governing the ad
mission of Chinese laborers returning to
this country. Heretofore the rule haa
been that a Chinese laborer In the United
States intending to leave this' country for
a visit to China, with the intention of re
turning:, should at least thirty days be
fore departure apply; to the Collector of
the Port for a certificate entitling him to
return. Tho application for such certifi
cate must state certain fact*. The new
rule provides that these certificates may
bo granted upon the bare application, and
that ninety- days prior to the â¢' return- to
the United States the applicant shall no
tify the Collector at the port of return of
such intention, and his proof of the re
quired fact that he has a lawful wife or
child or parent in the United States, or
$1000 worth of property here or debts of
like amount due him here. This notice
beforehand gives the Collector sufficient
time to Investigate before the arrival of
the Chinese laborer, so that there will not
ht any unnecessary delay In his landing.
Under the old rule the investigation was
made before the coolie was allowed 'to
leave the United States. â¢ - â¢

GRADUATING EXERCISES
OF ST. lONATlVS COLILEGE?
The moderator. Dr. Van Dyke, made an
address in response to the President's
speech. Prefiident Roosevelt remained
long enough to listen to the singing of a
evTiodical quartet from Tennessee. He
then went to the University Club,. ' .
That is one deed consummated to-day. Now
for the other. Ten days ago an appalling ca
lamity befell another portion of the West In
dian islands; territory belonging to two dif
ferent nations; Islands not under our flag; but
theJr need was great and this people eaw the
need end met it as quickly as possible. Co*i
grÂ«-*s at once appropriated large euma of
raorey. They were augmented by private gifts.
And. gentlemen. I find, as usual, that the
army and the navy were the instruments
through whfch the work could be done. The
minute I wanted men who could drop the
work they were engaged upon, assured that
neither pestilence nor volcano would make
them swerve from their duty, men of unques
tlor.able integrity. I turned to the army and
navy, and we sent them to the stricken Islands.
I am sure you all feel proud that ship* bear
ing the American flag should be among the
first, I think the very first, to take relief to
those overtekfn by so appalling a disaster.
More anarchy and ruin would have been be
fore the island if we had -been 5atlsfled with
the victories of war and left its people to ehift
tor themselves. For four years our representa
tives in the Island have been representatives
largely of the army. I sometimes hear the
army attacked, and I have even heard mission
aries attacked.. Still when great work is to be
clone In peace or war. it is good to have the
army to depend upon. Our representatives
worked to build up the school system, to es
tablish sanitary measures, to preserve order
and prepare for the starting of Industries, that
the new government might begin with the
chances in its favor. JCow, as a nation, we
bid it Godspeed and we intend to see it has all
the aid we can give it. I trust and believe our
pccple in the national Legislature will see to
it shortly that they have the advantage of en
tering into peculiarly close relations with our
economic eyrtem.
Coming up here to-night I made up my mind
to speak to you of the manifestations of the
epirit of national righteousness, of something
that has taken place this day, and something
that has happened within ten days; of the
action of this nation which culminated in the
L-reation to-day and in starting a new republic
on its course. That has represented four years'
work â blunderings and shortcomings in the
work, of course, and there were men of little
feJth who only saw the shortcomings and
blunders â but it represents work triumphantly
don*. We have the right to feel proud that
we have kept every pledge to the letter and
established a new national precedent. I don't
remember another euch case â and I have
searched for one with care â a . case where, as
the result of euch a war. the victorious nation
has contented itself by- starting a new nation,
tree on the difficult path of self-government.
The criticism of those who live softly, re
â¢note from strife, Is of little value; but it would
be difficult to overestimate the value of the
missionary work, cf those who go oucto share
iht hardship, and while sharing it to wage war
6gainst the myriad forms of brutality. It is
euch missionary work which prevents the pio
neere from einking perilously near the level of
the eavajrery against which they contend.
Without it the conquest of this continent would
have had little but an animal side. Without
it the pioneers' fierce and rude virtues and
somber faults would have been left unlit by
the flame of pure and loving aspiration. With
out it the life of this country would- have been
a life of inconceivably hard and barren ma
terialism. Because of it deep beneath and
through the national character there runs that
power of firm adherence- to a lofty ideal upon
which the safety of the nation will ultimately
dppÂ»nd.
Honor, thrice honor to those who for three
eeneratiens. during the period of tbU people's
great expansion, have seen that the fires of
living truth expanded as the nation expanded.
They bore the burden and the heat of the day:
they toiled obscurely and died unknown that
we might come into a glorious heritage. Let
us prove the sincerity of our homage to their
faith and their works by the way in which we
manfully carry toward completion what under
them was eo well begun.
But to-nijrht we celebrate a hundred year*
of mifsionury work done not Incidentally, but
with set purpose*; a hundred years of earnest
effort to spread abroad ttre eoEpel, to lay deep
the moral foundation upon which true nation- 1
al greatness must rest. The century that has
closed ha* eeen the conquest of this continent
by. our people. To conquer a continent is
roueh work. All really great work is rough
in the doing, though it may seem smooth
enough to those who look back upon it, or who
gaze upon it from afar. Thoroughness is an
unavoidable uart of the doing of the deed.
We need display but scant patience with those
who, sittinK at e*se in their own homes, de
light to exercise a querulous and censorious
part of judgment upon their brethren, who,
whatever their shortcomings, are doing strong
men's work. as they bring the light of. civili
zation into the world's dark places.
It is a pleasure on behalf of the people of
the United States to bid you welcome on this
hundredth anniversary of the beginning of or
ganized home missionary wprk by the Pres
byterian church. In one sense, of course, all
fervent and earntst church work is a part of
home tnifcsionHry work. Every earnest and
zealous believer, every man or woman who is
a doer or the Word, and net a hearer only, is
a isielcnc missionary' in his or her ' field of
labor. â a missionary by precept, and by what
is a thousandfold more than precept, by prac
tice. Every such believer exerts influence on*
th^se within reach, eornewhat by word and
infinitely more through the ceaseleES, j-et well
nigh unseen iiressure, all the stronger when
its exercise is unconscious, of example," of
broad, loving, charitable neitrhtKtrllness.
PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS.
When the President stepped to the front
of the platform he was interrupted by the
flashlight of a photographer. As the
emcke blew across the stage he laughed
and said: "There goes the mystery now,"
referring to the mystery of tne creed. HÂ«

When President Roosevelt took his seat
on the platform he received a great ova
tion. When the applause died away Mr.
Roosevelt took his seat between the Rev.
Dr. Van Dyke and the Rev. Dr. Stewart
Dodge, who was presiding. A choir of 125
voices from the different Presbyterian
churches sang the hymn, "Ye Servants of
God. Your Master Proclaim," and tho
Prc-Eident sang with them. In introducing
President Roosevelt Dr. Dodge said that

Spectacles more exciting or more truly
beautiful than that furnished last night
by the grand carnival at the Irish Fair
have seldom, If ever, been witnessed in
this city. From its commencement the
festival has been marked by many, scenes
that were Indeed ' spectacular, but the
coronation ceremony, and the triumphal
procession last night capped the climax.
The public evidently anticipated that the
carnival would result In an extraordinary
scene, as Mechanics' Pavilion was crowd
ed to its utmost.
The evening's programme was delight
fully inaugurated when 500 Woodmen of
the World, headed by a band'of fifteen
pieces and by a number of menrbers with
their axes and in full costume, marched
into the hall. When the Woodmen en
tered, the Pavilion was crowded, but
room was made for them and they parad
ed once around the building.
The special feature of the evening and
the event which the people had turned
out in such a vast crowd to witness was
the crowning of Miss Rita Curtis queen
of the Irish. Fair Carnival. This cere
mony was performed on a platform sit
uated ; in: the center of the floor of the
Pavilion. Â¦ - â¢ :\ .-..-., Â¦_
When Queen Rita ascended her throne,
which was placed just beneath an im
mense Irish flag, Mayor Schmlti in a
gracious speech, in which he extolled the
achievements of the Irish' people, pre
sented the keys., of the fair to Michael
Casey, the prime minister., That .official
thereupon transferred them -to her" ma
jesty. Queen Rita was gowned in regal
robes made of white brocaded satin,
trimmed in gold, and" an ermine cape. She
made a very graceful queen, to whom.it
was a pleasure to acknowledge allegiance.
The little flower girls were dressed In
white and the pages In pink.
Queen Rita's court was graced by the
following maids of honor:
Miss Agnes Keadrick of Academy booth,
Miss Tesste O'Connor of SHro, MlÂ»Â« Helen GHn
den of Kilkenny, Mias Kathryn Flynn of Gal
way, Miss Hannah Murphy of Kerry and Miss
Fhllomena Cull of Limerick.
Carmellta Smith and Peter Norton were
pages and little Misses May and Alleen
Hurley were the flower girls. When the
ceremony of coronation, was over the
queen and her court led a promenade
around the Pavilicn. . The procession
stopped at Cork booth, where a reception
was held in honor, of Queen Rita, who was
elected from that booth.
To-night the labor unions will have their
inning and wijl endeavor to make a mem
orable display. It is expected that the
members will turn out several thousand
strong. The unions will march to the Pa
vilion under the leadership of Grand Mar
shal Casey. The procession will start at
the corner of Fifth i and Market streets.
The grand marshal has selected the fol
lowing aids: " ' . , -â¢
A unique reception occurred this after T
noon 'in the rotunda room, when the â¢mis
sionaries Â¦:Â¦ from seven- foreign .countries
acted as hostesses. Each wore the-native
costume of the land from which she came,
and talked to. the guests about the pe
culiarities of that land's people. First,
five girls dressed as natives of India gave
a pantomime "performance under the di
rection of Mrs. Allen. Then Miss Scroggs
gave a short and interesting talk on her
experience with the people of Alaska.
The outside speakers who have been
here 8.0 far are Dr. Chapman of Los An
geles, who preached twice on Sunday and
again this evening, and Rev. Raymond C.
Brooks of the Pilgrim Congregational
Church of Oakland, who spoke last night.
The girls are entertaining a number of
faculty ladies from Berkeley and Stan

State committees, among them Mrs. W.

Solicitor General Richards replied to At
torney Miller, contending that the two
objections made to the order related to
two. powerful weapons of the "combina
tion or conspiracy of dressed meat deal
ers." Assistant United States Attorney
General Day .spoke to the same effect.
Judge Grosscup spoke at length before
giving his decision. He said that the
court would act no differently because
the Government is on one side and vast
business Interests on the other. It would
move slowly, and deliberately. The al
legations of the bill were reviewed at
length, and then the objeotlons raised by
Attorney Miller to the order were refer
red to. The court was of the opinion that
the contention was well grounded, for any
arrangement that tended to defeat the
"deadbeat" was for the advancement of
trade. In -conclusion, he said he did not
like the form of the order- of injunction,
submitted by the. District Attorney, and
that- while he would have to issue it,'
since no objection was raised by the de
fendants against its issue, he would draft
a new form. , . â¢- ; ' â¢;:' ,
Attorney John S. Miller, for the defend
ant packers, lead a brief reply, in which
he said that the packers in question do
only 40 per cent of the packing business
of the country, and this proportion could
not control the entire business. He as
serted that the prices of dressed meats
are relatively less than they were a*t
other times. The desire of the' packers,
he said, was to have a full and impartial
trial, and if objection were made at this
time to the filing of the petition and It
were tried on ex-parte affidavits this
would not be obtained.
As soon as court was reconvened after
the . noon recess Attorney Bethea was
given recognition. He asked the privilege
of calling the attention of the court to the
case of the United States of. America
against Swift & Co. and others, for such
Is the legal title of the now famous suit
Involving the existence of the alleged beef
trust. He read selections from the bill
praying for a temporary restraining order
and read many affidavits. All of these al-
Jeged the same cbndltions in the. meat
trade which have been set -forth in the
bill already published, each taking up
some particular phase of the allegations.
The general purpose of their presentation
was to make out befbre the court a prlma
facie case of disobedience and defiance of
the so-called Sherman anti-trust law.
Bethea" gave way to Assistant United
States Attorney General Day, who made
a brief argument In favor of the evidence
for granting the temporary order.
Attorney Bethea had with him Assistant
Attorney General \W A. Day, Solicitor
General J. K. : Richards.' United States

GOLIAD, Tex., May 20.â With the death
to-day of three of the persons -injured
in Sunday's tornado the total number of
dead is ninety-five. W. J. Purl, Mrs. John
Angerstein and a negro woman died this
afternoon. It is believed Â¦ that several
more of the injured persons cannot sur
vive. There we're many funerals again to
day and the same short service was ob
served as on the preceding days. Forty
five negroes have been buried. But little
effort is being made to obtain their names.:
The undertakers are rushed and have not
much time for .elaborate Â¦ details. .The
cemetery where the white people are
burled was wrecked and the new-made
graves are among the overturned tomb
stones.
It is believed that Mrs. Flachner, a sis
ter of Mrs. Willen, lost her life in trying
to save Willie. Clem Davier who was
driving a team near the flood in the Ken
tucky suburb, had his wagon overturned
by the water and was drowned. The
buildings of the Queen City, Bathing Club
on the river front at Dayton, Ky., op
posite Cincinnati, were demolished.
All the towns opposite suffered damage
from broken windows and houses being
unroofed, but the greatest damage on
both sides of the river, especially to the
business houses in Cincinnati and also In
Irvington and Newport, Ky., come from
cellars being suddenly filled with water.
It being impossible for the sewers and
gutters to carry the water off.
Superintendent Bassler of the United
States Weather Bureau reported the wind
as sixty miles an hour and the rainfall,
in less than half an hour, 2.36 inches, the
greatest on record here.
Prior to the unprecedented fall of rain
d<:nse clouds were seen to the south and
the city became as dark as at night. It
was afterward learned that there had
been a terrific waterspout on the Lewis
burg hills in the southern suburbs of Cov
ington, Ky., and it moved over the Ken
tucky suburbs into this city, passing up
the Miami Valley and causing damage as
far away as Dayton, Ohio.
While storm damages are reported
throughout Kentucky, the worst point
seems to have been in Covington. ThÂ«
water rolled down the hills in a wave
twenty feet deep in places and was about
100 yards wide. The frame house of Ed
ward Wohrley was carried for a distance
of over four blocks and finally was dashed
to pieces in the Covington ball grounds.
The house was occupied by four families
âHenry Willen and wife and four chil
dren; William Simpson and his wife and
children; Henry Qualbrink and family,
and Mrs. George Flachner. All had nar
row escapes except Mrs. Flachner and
Willie Willen, aged 4 years, who were
drowned. Mrs. Willen and her other
children were almost drowned. ;
CINCINNATI, May 20.â Shortly after U
o'clock to-day this neighborhood was

There is nothing so im-
portant in selecting a
piano as the selection of
the firm you purchase it
from. .
When you get a piano
you want an instrument
perfect in every way, me-
chanically correct and ar-
tistically right. Whert
you get a piano you want
a guaranteeâ you want it
guaranteed by a firm yon
can depend upon. YOU
WANT TO KNOW that
.-you get your money's
worth, for you must Te-
. member that pianos good
in looks can be made to
sell for as low as $75, while
instruments appearing al-
most the same are worth
a thousand dollars more.
Where can you feel safe "
but with a firm you have
had satisfactory expe-
. riencc with, and what firm
I in San Francisco ha3
served you better, than
Kohler & Chase? We
have been established for
53 years.

AT the second session of the Grand
Lodge of Knights of Pythias -of
the Domain of .California, in
Union Square -Hall' yesterday,* it
The - international horseshoers' conven
tion resumed its sessions â¢ yesterday, and
reports of officials were considered. The
report of the treasurer showed that there
was $10,000 more in the treasury of the in
ternational body than was on hand two
years ago. The . membership increased
2000 in two years, 'and -sixty unions were
admitted to the international. Interesting
addresses pertaining ' to the craft were
made during the day. '
There are few developments of Interest
in the fight of the carpenters. .The dis
trict council of the brotherhood met" last
night and reported that the men were
standing -fin*. The Building Trades Coun
cil continues to work silently, its mem
bers claiming that the brotherhood is
knocked out. The council is' ecoufaged
by the receipt of resolutions adopted by
the councilor Petaluma- condemning Un
ion 483 for its stand, and expressing the
hope that all .carpenters would soon see
the necessity for sticking to the working
card of the Building Trades Council. Vixk
The demands of the union will be draft
ed in proper form and submitted to tha
Labor Council for adoption., When this is
accomplished the. master barbers â¢will be
requested to- comply with the demands.
Some 500 shops and 1600 barbers are inter
ested in the outcome. Between now and
June 9 it is expected that .several confer
ences of the interested parties will be
held. . .
In pursuance of an agreement /entered
into' yesterday the new schedule of: wages
adopted by the Journeymen Barbers' Un
ion at a recent meeting will not go into
effect until June 0. This action defers the
strike which- was threatening until that
date, with a chance in.lavor of a compro
mise being reached meanwhile. . Â¦-.Â¦ ' ;Â¦- . '.Â¦_'.
The situation, however,, does not appear
to be promising for a settlement : of Cthjt
controversy without- concessions" being,
made by both sides. The smaller - shops,
it is claimed by the master barbers, .can
not afford to pay the increased wages de
manded, and the strongest protest in con
sequence comes from this quarter. The
larger shops are" paying more than $14 a
week to their journeymen employ.es, so
that the raise does not affect them. Still,
the Master Barbers' Union is arrayed
against' the . proposition of higher, wages,
and unless they consent to meet the in
crease friction with the journeymen's un
ion .is bound to. follow.
