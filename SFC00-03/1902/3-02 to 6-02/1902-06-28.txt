The Cabinet meeting was held in the
President's temporary quarters on Lafay
ette Square and was the first time in
eighty-eight years that a regular session
of the Cabinet has been held outside the
AVhite House.
The Cabinet also took up thÂ« question
of naming the naval vessels provided for
In the naval appropriation bill, and, it 13
stated, a decision was reached on Hhat
case, but It la desired not to make "the
names public until the vessels are actual
ly authorized.
Another subject under consideration at
the Cabinet meetlngto-day was the nego
tiations for the purchase, of the friars*
lands in the Philippines. Secretary Root
took with him to the meeting all tha
correspondence which haa passed be
tween himself and Governor Taft while
the latter has been carrying on his nego
tiations at Rome. It Is understood that
Secretary Root feels great confidence in
a successful outcome of Governor* Taffg
efforts. --â¢
When the islands are turned over to
the civil authorities they will not be left
without adequate military protection, as
no more troops will be ordered home for
the present and every precaution will be
taken for the military safeguarding of
the Islands for the new civil administra
tion. l V
TROOPS TO BE LETT.
While the proclamation Is subject to
changes in text, the general language of
the document Is pretty well mapped out.
There was a general discussion to-day
of the treatment that should be accorded
tho political prisoners of the islands.
There is no intention. It Is said, to re
lease prisoners convicted of other than
political offenses, the benefits of tha
amnesty being limited to those In custody
as a result of breaches of military law,
leaving criminal offenders to the action
of. Â£he proper authorities under the com
ing civil government. The purpose is to
demonstrate that motives of humanity
and generosity dictate our course toward
the Philippines.
The proclamation is based on the gen
eral objects of the Philippine bill, namely.
to restore peace In the archipelago and
substitute a civil for a military adminis
tration. That bill is now in conference
and the proclamation will not be issued
until the* Philippine Government bill has
been agreed upon by both house3 and the
President has affixed his. signature to it.
The proclamation will declare that a stato
of peace now exists in the Philippine Isl
ands, save In the parts of the archipelago
where the Mindanao or pagan tribes are
giving the United States a great amount
of trouble., and will declare In effect that
with a transfer of tha government of the
archipelago from a military to a civil
status all those arrested and held for po
litical offenses shall be restored to liberty,
granted full amnesty and allowed to par.!
ticipate in the civil government that is to
be established in the islands.

and other former leaders of the Filipino
Insurgents who have surrendered or been
captured are soon to become free men.
At the meeting of the Cabinet to-day the
terms of the amnesty proclamation to the
Filipinos, which Is contemplated to issue
on the Fourth of July, were agreed upon.
The War Department for some time past
has had under consideration the draft of
a proclamation and has found it neces
sary to make a number of changes in its
text. In its modified state It was agreed
to by the Cabinet to-day, and Secretary
Root will cable it to Acting Governor
Wright for his inspection. If it meets the
latter's approval nothing will remain but
for the President, if the Philippine Gov
ernment bill is a law on that day, as It is
now expected it will be, to issue on Inde
pendence day a formal proclamation set
ting forth terms of amnesty for all polit
ical offenders in the islands, Including
Aguinaldo and those held at Guam.

CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON, June 27.â President
Eoosevelt has requested Attorney General
Knox to make an examination of the
facts connected with the so-called an
thracite coal trust or combination. This
is with a view to ascertaining the exact
legal status of the great railroads and
coal companies that are acting in har
mony for the purpose of regulating the
price of coal, miners' wages., etc. This
*oes cot necessarily mean that the At
torney General will proceed ag^nst the
coal combination, as he has already done
against the Northern Securities Company
and the beef trust, but the chances are
that action will be taken when the whole
question has been thoroughly examined.
blatters are certainly crystallizing in that
direction, although the President to-day
to!d callers that he had not made up his
mind one way or the other. The Presi
dent has in his possession the report of
Carroll I>. Wright, Commissioner of La
bor, who made an investigation for him
cf matters in dispute between the coal
operators and miners. The President de
clined to discuss this report, saying that
he did not know whether It would be
made public or not.
ALLEGED COMBINATION. ,_
I'. Ur noT~&<rogm'noat~tn^ report? of
This .is a question which he alone must
determine after he hears from Attorney
General Knox. The Attorney General, It
is understood, is Inclined to discourage
the President from proceeding against the
coal trust at this time. His department
cow has under way four great prosecu
tions, Including that against the beef
trust. He thinks he should bo permitted
to bring these cases to an issue before he
Is called upon to proceed against any
more trusts. If the Government should
win these cases, the decision of the court
will, of course, settle the Question In
volved, and such combinations as the coal
trust would have to cease and either re
â¢ turn to the old competitive system or re
organize on new lines.
At the same time the President hesitates
about taking a step which may have very
serious consequences to the entire busi
ness, world. He will not adopt as a policy
war upon great combinations of capital.
He would like to single out good trusts
from bad trusts. Also, before he coun
tenances any further legal actions against
such combinations he would like to know
how the litigation which he has already
Instituted Is coming out. ':'. '''.'.â¢ \
GOOD ANTJ BAD TRUSTS.
In other words, there is said to be no
difficulty whatever in getting proof that
the railroads fix the price of anthracite
ccal to the consumer just as they fix the
price of the wages to the miner, the only
difference at this time being that the
price of coal is higher than ever before,
Trhile the wages of the miners remain sta
tionary. "Y-V i
It has been alleged that the railroads,
through their presidents, agree- that one
Trice for coal shall prevail at different
points: that the sales agents of roads
meet at stated periods and fix the price
cf coal; that the output of the coal mines
is absolutely regulated by the railroads
end can be increased or curtailed, at a
moment's notice and is so increased and
curtailed.
Commissioner Wright has any bearing
T-hatever upon the question of the exist
ence of a hard coal trust and of the vio
lating by that trust of the Sherman anti
trust law and interstate commerce law.
Wright's report, it is understood. Is do
voted largely to Cthe points actually in
controversy between the operators and
miners, the claims put forth by the two
sides in endeavoring: to fix the responsi
bility for the strike.

added, "I swear I don't."
"Do you think you know Aguinaldo bet

Just before this Question, was asked
Senator Lodge, as chairman of the com

hour for adjournment, had arrived. The
admiral took advantage of this announce

last question was being propounded and
when it was concluded said. "I think I

Replying to a i question as to whether
the agreement to surrender had been
made public at the time of the attack
upon Manila, Admiral Dewey said he
thought not. -. l>
"There are," he said, "lots of things
which are not communicated to 'the pub

Pa/terspn sought to secure from Ad
miral Dewey an admission that Aguiu
alrfo had' issued a proclamation of inde
pendence to the 'Filipinos about the time
of the sinking of the Spanish squadron,
but the admiral said he did not remem
ber it, although it was possible that he
might have done so. Patterson then read
the paper forwarded by Consul General
Pratt May 20, 1898, in" which the Filipino
leader said that providence had opened
the way for independence. to the Filipinos
and spoke of the Americans as their lib
erators. The admiral said, however,- that
he did nof remember to have seen the
paper. He had, he. said, given Aguinaldo
a printing press, and probably he used
this press for getting out his proclama
tions* . .
"I don't believe," he said, "that the
general entirely trusted the Spanish au
thorities. Still he did not say so In so
many words. I may add that I have since
learned that come of the Spanish; officers
were tempted to fire at us. Even my.own
flag lieutenant did not accept their proffer,
as in the best faith. I knew, however,'
that they would surrender, for I under
stood the straits they were in." ,
Asked by Patterson to explain his state
ment that General Merritt had not ac*
cepted the report that the Spaniards had
agreed to capitulate, â¢ â¢Admiral Dewey
said that was only his belief. ' , â¢â¢- . ;
MEKRITT WAS SUSPICIOUS.
The admiral said he had informed Gen
cial Merritt of the proffer of General
Jaudens, but he did not believe that Mer
ritt had taken "much stock in it." "I
assured him. that such was the case,"
said the admiral, "but told- him of ths
arrangement that before the. surrender
should take place I was to engage an out
lying fort and make the signal, according
to the international code, ,'Do you sur

to hoist .the white flag on the southern

of the British Consul had" been very cour

WASHINGTON, June 27.âAd
miral Dewey continued hia
testimony before the Senate
Committee on" the Philippines
Senator Carmack then put a number of
questions to ths witness. "Replying tp
these, the admiral said' it was true he had
assisted Aguinaldo in organising his army
by supplying him with arms, etc.; that
at that time there were ho. American sol
diers in the Philippines and that Aguin

these statements, which were in reitera

a man whom he regarded as a "common

Patterson then read WHdman's letter
of July 18, 189$, . saying that Aguinaldo
had conducted himself in a dignified
manner, etc., and the admiral assented to
the truth^of this statement. Speaking
of. Agujnaldo's loyalty the admiral said
he had become suspfcious of that leader
before the receipt- of his proclamation on
July 15. -He said:
"I began to suspect that he was not

/ Admiral Dewey also testified concern
ing the arms sent to Manila by Aguinaluo
and Senator Dietrich asked the admiral
if 'he did not believe that the aririB were
purchased with money previously paifl by
Spain to secure peace and that it was his
intention to use the money to foment an
other insurrection." * The admiral's re
ply was,- "Exactly so." Â¦ " , ; :
Patterson next called attention to* a
number of proclamations forwarded by
him to Washington in May, but Admiral
Dcv/ey said he did not remember having
read them, and in explanation of his fall
urs in this respect he Bald:' "The days

admiral did not, however, remember to
have promised to Agulnaldo hjs "cordial
co-cpepation," as the Consul had re
ported.
For the purpose of making inquiry con
cerning some of the representations of
Consul General Wildman, located at
Hongkong, Patterson asked concerning
that gentleman's character. The admiral
apparently hesitated to reply, but then
said: "He's dead, I'd rather not say. He

He added that he would prefer not to

WASHINGTON, June 27.â The Ways

Porto Rico and the Philippines prior to
the passage of the tariff acts affecting

"It's the best yet." was the popular
comment with which the bulletin posted
As the time approached for the posting
of the morning bulletin the crowd rapidly
increased. At 10:30 o'clock there were
febout 1000 persons standing around the
gates. '
At Buckingham Palace there was little
change to-day from preceding days. A
crowd gathered in the morning. One of
the earliest callers at the palace was Mr
Ealfour, who drove up in a hansom
shortly after 9 o'clock, but stayed only
a few minutes.
As to the critical period, it is significant
that som* 1 foreign Princes, near relative*
of his Uajesiy. propose to remain in Lon
don until Sunday. It is understood that
their object ls to see the crisis over. If
favorable reports are made up to and in
ciuding Sunday it may be taken for
granted that the King will then be prac
tically out of danger.
AWAIT THE CHISIS.
Perhaps more significant than the of
ficial news given out from London is a
short telegram from the Daily Mail's cor
respondent in Copenhagen, which eays
that while King Christian, who is in ex
cellent health, had intended coming to
Jvordon, Qusen Alexandra had wired him
back that there was no necessity for his
undertaking the journey, as KinÂ£ Edward
â¢was making excellent progress.
Crown Prince Waldemar telegraphed
an eo.ually reassuring message to King
Christian. -
So confident. are all now of complete
end early recovery that it is understood
that it has been formally settied i that
Â¦when the time arrives the royal patient
will be carefully moved to Cowes and
placed on board the royal yacht.
Sir Henry Thompson said the King's
condition was hopeful for recovery. It
wae, however, too early to say that his
Majesty was out of danger, but if the
present improvement continues for a
Â¦week or ten days from the time of the
operation he thought preparations for the
coronation might be resumed. The only
danger to be feared, in his opimop, wa*
the possibility of cellular or other .'tissues
In the region of the wound becoming af
fected, but from what other medical men
said the steady improvement in his Ma
jesty's condition was attributable to the
feet that he had been able to maintain
bis strength. If the King continued to
bold his own in this respect his recovery
\.y.a assured.
Tipes have not yet, of course, been re
moved, his general progress is very sure
and steady. Of course any remaining
danger lies in the possibility of pus re
appearing and reforming in the wound,
but of this there is as yet no trace, nor
is there any trace of organic disease of
*ny. kind.
U is also likely that as soon as his Ma
jesty is pronounced to be out of danger

resolution: '-â¢
KING EDWARD'S CONDITION.
Teller charged <hat the entire reciproc
ity propaganda had been backed by the
American Sugar Refining Company and
by Americans who were interested finan
cially In Cuban sugar plantations. The
purpose, he said, was to strike down an
important agricultural industry of this
country. He was willing to Join in a
general revision of the tariff to meet
changed conditions, but unless the duties
on iron and steel and other products were
reduced with those on gugar, in order
that the arrangement might be equitable,
the beet sugarvgrowers never would con
sent to a reduction on their product.
Platt of Connecticut, chairman 'of the
Cvban Relations Committee, replied to
the Colorado Senator. He maintained
that there was nothing sordid in the de
sire to promote reciprocal relations be
tween the United States and Cuba, and
eaid the making -of some concessions to
Cuba was a plain duty of this country.
It was a duty which this Government
owed to itself as well as to Cuba, be
cause absolutely friendly relations with
the new republic were a necessary means
or defense to this country unless the
united States should annex the island,
lhat. he hoped, would not be done, as he
regarded the annexation as a grave men
ace to S\it institutions.
The House to-day began consideration
of the contested election cade of Horton
versus Butler, from the Twelfth Missouri
District. The vote will be taken to-mor
row. Some odds and ends were cleared
UP during the early portion of the ses-
Eion. Requests for unanimous consent,
lor which there is always a great de
mand during the closing days of a ses
eion, were suddenly blocked to-day by-
Moon of Tennessee, who told his friends'
that he would object to all such requests
unta he was recognized to ask consiaer
ation of the bill to give the Indian Terri
tory a Territorial form of government.
WASHINGTON, June 27.-Quite unex
pectedly a sharp debate arose in the Sen

'Mr. Boardmanâ I will read the article,

The Courtâ Read the article.. \\:
The Courtâ That is very true. I. think
we will have to proceed In that way, and
it will take some time to read the article
in evidence.
CALL EXPOSE IN EVIDENCE.
Mr. Campbell â We have no objection to
its going to the record, but we don't
think It is necessary it should be read,
as it is introduced. The record is simply
a copy. We are willing to consider it
read.
The Courtâ If the official reporter will
copy it into the record. '
Mr. Campbellâ Undoubtedly. â¢
Mr. Hanleyâ Does the court know what
it is without it is read into the record?
The Courtâ The record in this prelimi
nary examination is a matter to be con
sidered in the completeness of the record;
it is the practice m the Police. Court al
ways to put in the record everything that
is admitted In evidence.
Mr. Campbell â Can't it be considered as
read like any other exhibit, and then bo
copied. by the reporter? The thing itse.f
is the evidence. It is simply a copy of
what is taken
Mr. . Boardmanâ My reading it does not
add anything to the document.
Mr. - Hanleyâ It strikes me everything
ought to be put in evidence and read into
the record.
Mr. Boardman â If your Honor please. I
don't care to take the time of the court
in reading that article in evidence, if it
ir,ay be considered as read in evidence
and incorporated into the record by the
reporter: otherwise I will. read the arti
cle, if it is necessary, to get it into this
rtcord.
The Court â I don't see just how you can
avoid readine the matter in evidence.
Mr. Boardmanâ I know that is the gen
eral practice, your Honor.
The Courtâ Do you, Mr. Hanley, see how
it can be avoided? . Â¦
ask to have the article marked as an ex
hibit. . . . - Â¦ . . ..-.,_
The . Courtâ Any objection, Mr. Camp
bell? . Â¦ -
* Mr. Campbellâ "We have no objection.
The Courtâ There being- no. objection, it
Is admitted in evidence marked as sug
gested by counsel, '.'People's Exhibit A."
Mr. Boardmanâ This issue of the
newspaper the San. Francisco Call., of
date the 24th. day of May, -1902. contain
ing this article, had a general circulation
in the city and county of San Francisco,
did it not, after the day of its publica

Â¦A.â Yes,- sir.. ' Â¦ Â¦Â¦.
Q.â And on the day of its publication?
A.â Yes, sir.
Mr. Boardmanâ I think that is all, Mr.
Martin. '. . Â¦ -â¢Â¦
Â¦ The Court (to Mr. Campbell)â Do you
want to cross-examine the witness? Â¦
Mr. Campbell â Any- questions, Mr. Dis
trict Attorney?
Mr. Boardmanâ I have not Â¦ consulted
him about that. . .
Mr. Hanleyâ No questions.
Mr. Campbellâ We have no questions.
The Courtâ That is all, Mr. Martin..
â¢ Mr. Hanley â You had better read the
complaint in the record.
SCENE IN COURT AT THE TRIAL OF THE GAGE SUIT FOR LIBEL.
Later in the day the proprietor and the manager of The Call were sur
rendered by their bondsmen in the San Pedro proceeding and were placed
in the custody of the Chief of Police. A writ of habeas corpus was at once
secured from Judge Murasky on the ground that the San Pedro prosecu
tion is illegal since the offended party, being the Governor of the State, re
sides officially in- Sacramento County. The trial consequently should be held
there or in San Francisco County. This writ is returnable on Monday before
Judge Cook. Judge Fritz also decided yesterday that he has no jurisdiction
in the San Pedro case.
When the case was called by Judge Fritz the prosecution was represented
by Assistant District Attorney Hanley, who appeared to be suffering in a
temporary trance, and by Louis P. Boardman. The defense, represented by
Attorneys J. C. Campbell, W. H. L. Barnes and E. F. Preston, indicated its
<iesire to proceed. The defendants were instructed as to their rights, and Wil
liam J. Martin, business manager of The Call, was placed upon the witness
stand to identify them. This having been done, the alleged libelous publi
cation was read and the prosecution called for Martin G. Aguirre, Warden
of San Quentin prison.
He had been properly subpenaed..^ service had been made, but he was not
present. The court asked Attorney Boardman if he wished an attachment is
sued, but the complainant declared that he did not wish to be harsh and
would not demand such a measure until the next session of the trial.
Blocked at the very beginning of the investigation, nothing further could be
done. Judge Fritz continued the case until Tuesday morning at io o'clock,
when, the court declared, he will be pleased to hear argument bearing upon
the question of jurisdiction. Attorney Campbell, for the defense, announced
that he was ready to proceed with the argument at once, but Judge Fritz de
'clared that it would suit his convenience better to postpone the discussion un
til Tuesday. Governor Gage had succeeded in temporarily throttling an in
quiry for which he has been so loudly clamoring.
This judicial inquiry, which offered to Governor Gage under the protec
tion of a court of the State the satisfaction he seeks, was necessarily delayed.
The exploitation of affairs which will leave the Governor's character as it was
before the expose of The Call or give to the revelations of this paper the
stamp of judicial sanction was clogged.
The proprietor and the manager of The Call were ready yesterday, to
give Governor Gage the justice he demands. But Governor Gage, properly
summoned and advised, ignored the court. He had pleaded that he wanted no
delay, that he had been grossly humiliated in the house of his brethren, -and
demanded the law's satisfaction. But when the opportunity for that satisfac
tion came he ignored it and refused to accept what will be the inevitable pre
sentation of facts. His friend and official creature, Warden Aguirre, did
worse. He accepted the sen-ice of a subpena to attend the proceeding as a
witness and then contemptuously remained away.
The court is admittedly one of competent jurisdiction; It is a tribunal
where Governor Gage, in absolute fairness, may prosecute his plea and where
the defendants may present those facts that will constitute the justification of
the publication against which Governor Gage complains. The time yester
day was opportune. The proprietor and the manager of this paper were
ready to justify their act or be punished for an injustice. They were ready
to proceed, to hasten the presentation of facts, with due decorum and in
obedience to the rules of a court of justice.
GOVERNOR HENRY T. GAGE and Warden M. G. Aguirre
demonstrated yesterday beyond. the possibility^ of question that
they wish neither an immediate nor a complete judicial investi
gation of the charges which this paper has preferred against the
administration of San Quentin prison. In the proceeding insti
tuted by Louis P. Boardman in this city against the proprietor and the man
ager of The Call Governor Gage and Warden Aguirre have proved that they
will struggle against the judicial presentation of the truth in a matter in
which Governor Gage declared his personal honor is at stake. The trial
of the proprietor and of the manager of this paper upon a charge of having
criminally libeled Governor Gage was called yesterday, morning in.' Judge
Fritz's court. Neither Governor Gage, who says he feels , the wounds of a
lacerated character, nor Warden Aguirre, who has been accused of grave of
fenses, was present or represented. by counsel.
The immediate relatives present at the
last rites were decedent's widow, Mrs.
Arthur Rodgers; Miss Millie Rodgers, Misa
Annie Montgomery, Miss Hazel Montgom
ery. Dr. Lee Rodgers, Luther Rodgers,
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Rodgers of Watson
vllle, Mr. and Mrs. . John Brown of San

Knoxville, Tenn., and "Walter C. Rodgers.
Mrs. Rodgers, mother of the deceased71s
seriouslv ill and was unable to be present.
The body was taken "to Cypress Lawn
Cemetery, where it will lay in a vault un
til such time as Mrs. Rodgers shall decide
where ifshall be interred.
The funeral services over the body of
Arthur Rodgers. the prominent lawyer,
who died at Auburn, Placer. County, on
Tuesday last, took place yesterday at the
residence of his brother,' Dr. Lee O. Rod
gers, at Â§17 Grove street.

LOSS OF ARTHUR RODGERS
Mr. Hanleyâ Monday or '.Tuesday? ""â¢
The Court â Tuesday rather, the 1st of
July, at 10 o'clock. Jn the other matter
submitted to me some time 1 ago I had
about reached a. conclusion at the time
this complaint was filed and then stopped
my research. . After examining the stat-
ccse was filed before the complaint filed
in this court. It seems to me that before
we go into this case very deeply the mat
ter of jurisdiction should be determined
in some manner. It seems that it would
be a waste of time and expense to this
city and county arid also a waste of time
nrd expense to the city of Los Angeles
if we proceed in both these actions before
the question of jurisdiction is determined.
However. 1 will pass the matter now un
til Monday morning. I just make that
suggestion.
Mr. Campbellâ I am perfectly ready to
argue that c;uestlon.
The â¢ Caurtâ The question of. jurisdic
tion?
Mr. Campbellâ As " to jurisdiction; that
your Honor has the jurisdiction here.
The Courtâ The ca.se will be continued
then until Monday morning.

SCOTTISH THISTLE CLUB
TO HOLD A BIG OUTUfQ
WORK has been commenced on th9
amphitheater in which Jeffries
and Fitzslmmons will meet for
their championship battle.'
, A lot on' the southeast corner of Four
teenth and Valencia streets has been se
lected as the site. This is a part of the
Woodward property and adjoins Wood
ward's Pavilion on the south.
At present a stout ten-root fence sur
rounds the property. A twenty-foot fence
will be built just inside this. The prin
cipal entrance will be on the Valencia
street eide. N The ring will be built in the
center of a space 160 feet square. A tent
will cover the central hundred feet, leav
ing the remaining thirty feet on each slda
uncovered. This is the largest canvas
that could be secured. The seats will slope
up gradually from the ringside. The spec
tators Jn the last row of seats will be but
eighty feet from the ring, giving all an ex
cellent view of the heavyweight battle.
This amphitheater is guaranteed to seat
8000 people. On 'the night of the Jeffrles-
Ruhlin- fight there were 6500 people in Me
chanics' Pavilion. .

GOURSING men are making unusual
preparations for the three days'
meeting, to be held at Union Cours-
Ing Park during the Independence
day holidays. The seventh annual re
newal of the ladies' day champion stake
will be the feature of the card. This is
one of the big events on the leashmen's
calendar and has always attracted the
best dogs in training.
The r list. of previous winners makes a
veritable roll of honor. The stake wa3
instituted in 1896 at Ingleslde Park, when
It attracted an entry of eight hounds. It
was won by J. H. Rosseter's Wayfarer,
with Valley; Maid runner-up. The other
competitors were: Skyball, Flying Buck,
Royal Buck, Flashlight, Lisak and San
Joaquin.
The winner was not scored against arid
the betting in the deciding course was
not as to which dog would win, but
whether the runner-up would score. At
one stage of the course it seemed "Valley
Maid- would surely score, but Wayfarer
came with a rush from behind and picked
up the hare. On this' day Mr. Rosseter
won all three stakes. Ho took the Ladies'
Derby with Arapahoe and the Park stake
with Kitty Scott.
In 1897 Grace & Dean's Moondyne II
won, with Bartels & Rosseter's imported
Firm Friend second. ,'â¢-â¢; :
In 1898 the stake was run for the first
time at Union Park. ' The peerless For
Freedom won, defeating E. V. Sullivan's
False Flatterer. It was on this occasion
For Freedom electrified the spectators by
showing a burst of speed unparalleled
possibly on any coursing field. False
Flatterer, himself a great courser, was
far ahead of For Freedom, the latter be
ing apparently unsighted. Ho suddenly
caught sight of the. hare, and, seeming to
fly through the air, dashed past False
Flatterer, picking up the hare and kill
ing. These were the 'only points scored
during the course.
In 1899 James Dean's popular black dog
Connemara and Gladiator from his own
kennel, won first and second money.
. In 1900 the stake attracted sixteen en
tries for the-flrst time. On this occasion
Eugene Geary's champion Palo Alto, then
at the aenlth of his powers, led and beat
A. R. Curtis' Beacon.
In 1901 Frank Jones was the lucky win
ner, . Wedge wood and Harllan Galdys,
from his kennel, winning first and second
money.
Next week Beacon, Rector. Palo Alto,
Sacramento Boy, Homer Boy and other
great . greyhounds will . struggle for the
$1000 purse:- All the dogs 'are being given a
special preparation. As the hares are be
coming stronger each succeeding week,
the winner must be prepared to go the
route.\ . The dog which relies on speed
alone will hardly cut much of a figure.
A reserve stake of sixteen entries will
be run to a conclusion to-day at Union
Coursing Park. In addition a class re
serve stake of forty-eight entries will be
run down once. The remainder of this
stake, with a special and a consolation
stake, will be decided to-morrow. The
likely winners look to be:
Reserve stake â Hlghstepper, Creswick. Mel
rose, Rustic Anna; Arbaces. Advance "Guard,
Sastlake and Rustic Arbor.
Special stanceâ -Roman Athlete, Ireland, Roy
Hughle, Brutus, Old Ironsides, Flying Fox,
Narcissus, Silver Cloud, Golden Garter, San
tonin, Cascade. Fair Oaks, Vandal, Tralee Boy

Nestor. White Hat, Partial Eclipse, Morning
Glory and Charming Thought.
Second payment 1 on the Futurity stake
will be due â¢ July 1. First payment was
made on 103 young greyhounds.
Eddie Neaves is expected to arrive to
day from , the East with. a string . of
twenty-one greyhounds. As he spent sev
eral years here and knows the competi
tion he must meet it is expected he has
some good . ones under his charge. Wil
liam McCaffrey is supposed to be with
him. He has the Orthwein dogs from St.

Previous Years' Running
Raymer continues to play sensational
ball at second for Los Angeles. He has
had an unusual amount of hard chances
In the past few* games, and has taken
them all in great style. If ha can set
a good example by hitting the ball harder
he will make an ideal captain for the
southern band. .
Many fans will regret Holly's departure
from the local team. He was a conscien
tious ball-player and always tried hard
to win. He acted improperly In tryinar
to get more salary than he signed to play
for. Harris can easily fill Â¦ Holly's plac*.
and in a few weeks the cranks will for
get the lamented one.
Cristall, the erratic little Oakland south
paw, has ali the pitching records to him
self. He has pitched a no-hit game, a
one-hit same and also a two and three
hit game. If some team can bat him for
about twenty-flve safe swats ho will hold
all the records.
General Andrew Burt, U. S. A., retired,
is one of the greatest ball fans . in tha
army to-day. The general arrived, from
the Philippines a few days ago. and at
tends all the games. He has many in
teresting . tales to tell of tho nine ha
managed in Manila. . It held the cham
pionship In army circles, having defeat
ed every team, that ever . wore & bluo
uniform.
It is a singular fact, but the Oakland
team has not released nor signed a sin
gle player since the season opened, nor
has one of its number been unkind enougU
to jump a contract. Perhaps this con
tributes to the success the leaders have
met with in their efforts to win tho flag.
No other team in Â¦ the league can raako
tha same boast.
The vast army of southpaws that In
vaded the league at the beginning of thvÂ»
season is rapidly beginning to thin out.
At the opening of the race there were
seven south-mitters doing stunts. Of
this number only two remainâ Cristall
and Meredithâ the rest having either
jumped or been released. Strangely
enough, the two remaining lads, are th'n
only ones who seemed to possess gooi
serse, as tho rest of the bunch wera
wrcng in some way or other.
Jim Morley's movements in the Eastern
titles will bo watched with interest by

revenge on Connie Mack for enticing tho

stars when Morley begins to hanii out
his flattering offers. . .

ALTHOUGH at one time fears were
expressed that the "senior barge
race, the most important event at
the annual rowing regatta of the
Pacific Association, might fall through
owing to a "paucity of entries, it now
seems certain, there will be three or lour
crews to face the starter.
The Alameda "Spiders" .will strain
every nerve to retain the championship
which they have held so long. The South
End Rowing Club has made up a senior
crew, consisting of James Pallas, bow;
E. M. Cashman, No. 2; Joseph Lyons, No.
3, and J. E. Scully, stroke. Albert Son
nenberg will probably be the cockswain.
Though the" crew has not' had a long
period. of practice, it is going out every
night and expects to .be in good trim.
The Portland^ Rowing Club four will tako^
part in the~"senior barge race and the'
Ariel intermediate crew will also enter
in the senior class.
The Ariel intermediate crew has been
practicing regularly under the coaching
of Leander Stevenson, the use of the
South End Club's- quarters having been
kindly accorded to the wearers of the
royal blue and white. The Intermediate
four Is made up ,of Alexander Keegan,
bow; Edwin Smith, No. 2; E. J. Lynch,
No. 3: Charles Wilson; stroke, and E.
Flanders, cockswain. Flanders will also
steer the junior crew, consisting of Ed-*
ward Murphy, . bow; Matt Brady, No. 2;
W. McKee, No. 3, and H. Thompson,
3troke. is.;"/.*;-' IV?
The Dolphin Boating Club will nave
junior and intermediate crews in the
Lake Merritt regatta. The intermediate
crew Is made up of F. W. Woerner, low;
C. M. Farrell, No. 2; W. O. Patch, No. 3;
T. J. Kennedy, 'Stroke, and W. Carroll,
cockswain. The junior four has the same
cockswain, and Is manned by J. Relmers,
bow; W. Harris, No. 2; T. Harris, No. 3.
and T. R. DlxOn, stroke. Alexander W.
Pane will pull In the senior shell race
and George Baker and F. J. Sherry in
the. senior outrigged skiff event.
The Alameda Boat Club will have sen
ior, Intermediate and junior barge crews,
as well as representatives in the senior
and -junior outrigged skiff races. The
crews have been training regularly and
are in good condition. F. W. Ayers rows
stroke of the senior four, setting the
short, rapid stroke for which the Al
ameda crews have becomo known. As
the course is only a mile distant of the
mile-and-a-half. which the championship
course has been supposed to be in pre
vious regattas, the short stroke is likely
to be even more effective than usual. The
intermediate crew has been coached by
Sidney Pollard. The junior crew is light,
but strong. In the senior outrigged skiff
race the Alameda entries will be E. B.
Thanlng and John Lewis. In the junior
Bkiff event Harry Dumont and Jamea
Lewis will be the representatives from
the creek.
The Olympic Club men arj training un
der unusually advantageous circum
stances, as they are living at Belvedere
and going out every night, for practice,
besides taking a quick run on the road
in the morning. W. B. Goodwin, who in
previous seasons has devoted much pains
to coaching the crews of the University
of California, is taking the Olympic four
in hand. If the crew can profit by his
coaching it will make a uangerous -om
petltor in -the Junior barge race.
The South End Rowing Club, in addi
tion to Its senior barge crew, has junior
and intermediate fours in training. The
junior crew Is made up of Dr. C. 0. Den
nis, bow; E. Wolf, No. 2; James P. Foley
No. 3, and Frank Baker, stroke. The
intermediate four consists of Frank Pal
las, bow; Matt Harris, No. 2; Sam Ber
ger, No. 3, and Edward Pallas, stroke.
John T. Sullivan, formerly a well known
member of the Pioneer Rowing Club and
an adept in the outrigged skiff, has been
elected a member of the South Ends
The South. End Rowing Club will short

send a barge crew and a single sculler
for the regatta on Lake Merritt. The
barge crew is made up of S. Breeze bow

evening the crew rows flve or six mile3
on the Stockton slough. They are usinsr
the boat in which the Stockton ''Gianta"
covered a mile-and-a-half course in 8-77
on Admission day, 1S97. They pull a lone
stroke, thirty to the minute. Though I
comparatively slow - stroke, W ell nuilpri
through, with good catch at ilia bec-ln
nlng, and a clean finish, is certainly far
superior over a long course, a crew thnt
is thoroughly well together, as the Al
ameda senior crew â¢ has - been for somÂ«>
years- past, .can make great speed with a
short, quick, bucketing stroke that no
crew could keep f up over a four-mile
course without going to pieces. As. tha
Lake Merritt course will probably bp n
scant mile. It is 'extremely doubtful
whether a crew, rowing 30 strokes to the

Jl gained a national reputation owing to his marvelous ability
and daring in diving' from great' heights.
His record dive was from the top of a pile-driver into the
Stockton channel, a hundred feet below. On. another occasion he
dived from the bridge which spans . the Sacramento River at Red
Bluff. The descent here was seventy feet. On two occasions he per
formed at Astoria regatta, diving
into the Columbia River from pile
drivers ranging in height from
sixty to eighty feet.
. In addition to his ability as. a\
high diver Geddes is also clever
at fancy diving from a trapeze
or a springboard. These'., trick
dives are covered by the technical'
Terms: back dives, "one and a
halfs," the dive so clearly, shown'

somersaults, gaynors and half
gaynors. Geddes is an amateur,
gaining his livelihood from other
sources of commercial activity.
He has had ..many offers,' from

"California Golf," the first issues of
which were brought out by John Duncan
Dunn, is being puDlished by H. M. Grind
lay at Los Angeles. The June issue con
tains an Interesting article by Walter
Fairbanks, the amateur champion of
Southern California* on "Brilliancy in
Golf. in this he contends that an essen
tial point in every first-class golfer's play
is his power of recovery when badly
bunkered or in long grass off the course.
These remarks will be read with the more
interest because "Walter Fairbanks him
self has often been described as a steady
but not a brilliant golfer.
The controversy about the merits of the
Haskell ball is still going on, especially in
Great Britain, where the best golfers were
at first almost unanimous against it.
Both the winner land the runner-up in the
British amateur championship used it
throughout the competition. It is said
that hard, long drivers gain no advantage
from it, but that all golfers can get a
longer shot, off an Iron club with the Has
kell than -with the ordinary "guttle."
Just why this is so is not clear. If a still
more improved ball should enable golfers
to drive thirty or forty yards farther than
at present, the golf courses now In exist
ence would have to bÂ« laid out afresh. To
avert so serious a matter and to put all
players on a level as regards the imple
ments of the game, it may become neces
sary to adopt a standard ball, aa is done
in baseball, cricket or billiards-
There will probably, be a handicap tour
nament on the links of the San Francisco
Golf Club on the Fourth, but no definite
announcement has yet been made. On
Saturday, July 5, on the links of the San

the winner last year. It is understood
Mrs. Doubleday will not compete. Mrs.
R. . Gilman Brown and Mrs. Laurance I.
Scott will be the principal competitors, as
they were in last year's contest. If
either wins, Jhe trophy will become her

Judge Hhodes holds that the act of Mrs.
Yoell in receiving $2500 a few days before
petitioning to be declared insolvent and
paying certain creditors, of which she
made no mention in her petition, was
one of fraud and preference under the
insolvent act. The creditors will attempt
to collect from the property Mrs. Yoell
now owns. .
Shortly after her discharge as an in
solvent debtor Mrs. Y.oell became the
owner of one-half of the property held
by her husband, which it seems was com
munity property and which was valued at
$200,000.
Four days after the dismissal of the
suit for divorce Mrs. Yoell filed a peti
tion to be declared insolvent. The sched
ule snowed that she owed bills amounting
to about $25,000 and had no assets. Sha
made no mention of the receipt of the
$25w or the payment of certain creditors.
' SAN JOSE, June 27.â The discharge* of
Insolvency of Mrs. Emily C. Yoell, wife
of J. Alexander Yoell/ & pioneer lawyer
and capitalist, was set aside by Judge
Rhodes this morning, and creditors now
have a good chance to o'btain a portion of
the $200,000 which it is alleged she re
ceived from her husband. Mrs. Yoell
commenced a divorce suit on the ground
of cruelty in April, 1897. The Yoells fin
ally settled their differences and the case
was dismissed a few months later on the
agreement of Yoell to pay his wife $5000,
of which she was to receive $2500 on the
day of dismissal. This $2500 was to be
applied on the claims of certain urgent
creditors.

To-night the wind is blowing thirty,
miles an hour, but the Weather Bureau
states that it will veer to the west by
morning and produce clear weather fur
Saturday. The only damage reported in
Galveston was the burning out of fifteen
motor cars by the water getting into the
electric machinery.
The wind held steady from the south
west and reached a velocity of sixty- five
miles in one arid two minute gusts dur
ing the early portion of this morning.
The tide was pot dangerously high, being
but two feet above normal, but the
storm, which originated in the West Gulf
and passed on the land with its center
fully fifty miles west of Galveston, made
itself felt on the island.
GAL VESTON, June 27.-The wind and
rain storm which struck Galveston last
night continued with increased intensity
until this afternoon..
The caucus lasted only an hour and was
devoted to a discussion of the terms of
the foregoing resolution, which was
drawn up by Representative Jackson of
Kansas and presented by Representative
Grlggs of Georgia, chairman of the Dem
ocratic. Congressional Committee. A
number of speeches were made arraigning
the majority* in Congress and in support
of_a strong Democratic declaration, j Rep
resentative Richardson of Tennessee, the
Democratic floor leader, was among the
speakers. At the close of his speech the
resolutions were adopted unanimously.
"Fourthâ We oppose the adjournment of
Congress until the measures mentioned
above have been enacted into law."
"Resolved, First, that we condemn the
Republican majority in Congress for their
failure to pass a measure providing reci
procity with Cuba. ' The bill wh^h passed
the House of Representatives was heart
ily supported by the Democratic minority
after the protection to the sugar trust
had been removed by a solid vote, aided
by a small minority of the Republican
members. As it passed the House, the bill
carried relief to Cuba, reduced the price
of sugar to American consumers and
struck a heavy blow at the notorious and
obnoxious trust. The refusal of the Re
publican Senators to consider this meas
ure unless the protection to the sugar
trust should be restored, gives evidence
that the President and Republican party
In Congress are willing to refuse relief to
Cuba and totally ignore American con
sumers rather than abandon their alliance
with the trusts. The failure of all reci
procity legislation with Cuba rests upon
the Republican administration, which is
willing to reduce the duty on the raw-pro
duct of our producers, but unwilling to
destroy the sugar monopoly.
"Secondâ That the Republican majority
in Congress Is dominated and controlled
by the trusts and monopolies which have
the industries of .our country in their
grasp, is shown by its action in passing
an anti-trust bill through the House of
Representatives of the Fifty-seventh
Congress in the closing hours of the ses
sion, the Senate refusing to consider. the
same as a subterfuge to tide over the
election of 1900. That bill has been aban
doned and they have ever since refused
and do now refuse and fall to brins in
any measure to suppress the trusts or to
favorably report any of the numerous
anti-trust bills introduced by Democratic
members during this Congress.
."Thirdâ That we favor the passage of a
measure to amend the present anti-trust
law so as to more fully protect trade
and commerce against unlawful restraints
and monopolies, and also a measure to
reduce the duties on all articles and com
modities manufactured and controlled or
produced In the United States by a trust
or trusts, so as to destroy . such Illegal
ccmbinations and to reduce the rate of
duty on any article or commodity manu
factured in the United States and sold in
a foreign country more cheaply than in
the United States. '
WASHINGTON, June 27.â A caucus of
the Democratic members of the House
held to-day adopted the following resolu
tion:
A large increase is reported in the num
ber of deaths, both from injuries and from
diseases. The increases in the former
class were due largely to the battle at
Bayan, Mindanao, and in the latter class
to cholera.
WASHINGTON, June 27.â Surgeon Gen

OAKLAND.
Both Reilly and Devereaux played su
perb ball at third, accepting several hard
chances without an error. Mohler fur
nished the star play .of the day in the
ninth: Lawler hit an apparently safe one
past first base. Mohler made a great
sprint and succeeded in picking up the
ball with his left hand and throwing the
fleet footed Lawler out by a foot, s The
score:
Francks hit an easy one to Toman, who
fumbled the ball, and the bases were full.
Gorton placed a nice hit past second base,
which put Devereaux on the safe side of
the rubber. Householder picked up the
ball and made a grand throw to the plate
to catch Dunleavy, but Anderson muffed
the ball and Dunleavy was safe. Hod
son struck out, but Mohler hit for two
bases, which brought in Francks and Gor
ton.
The Oaklands again took the lead by
making one run in their half of the
sixth, but the Angels were there with a
pair In the seventh. This made the score
5 to 4 in favor of Los Angeles.
The crisis came in the eighth. McCree
die beat a slow one to first and Deve
reaux advanced him to third by a single
to right field. Dunleavy bunted and Mc-
Creedie scored, Dunleavy reaching first
on the attempt to retire the runner at
the plate.
The second inning produced the first
Oakland run, which resulted from To
man's error and a pair of singles by
Francks and Dunleavy. McCreedie and
Devereaux singled in the fourth and then
worked a pretty double steal. Dunleavy
got a ! rap on the head, filling the bases.
Francks drove one to Hartwell, who re
tired McCreedie at the plate and doubled
up Francks at first. Gorton's well placed
single sent /Dunleavy and Devereaux
home, when it looked as though no Oak
land runs were coming.
Up to the sixth round Hodson had the
Angels locked in the coal bin. Hartwell
started the fun In the sixth by beating
out a little drive to second. Toman sin
gled over third and i-awler hit to right
field. Jackson delivered a hot one. which
Hodson could not handle, and Hartwell
scored. Householder sent a grounder to
Devereaux, who threw to second to re
tire Jackson, but Mohler dropped the ball
and Toman scored. Lawler tied up the
score by scampering In on Reilly's hit
post short.
Up to the eighth inning the spoils be
longed to either side, and If any of tne
numerous spectators were asked about
the result they would take on a wise ex
pression and say, "You can search me."
After the eighth the Angel fire was
quenched by a cloudburst of Oakland tal
lies, which reached the number of five
when the third man was sent to the tim
bers.
It came near being a brilliant game
even from a scientific point of view. The
only thing which failed to make It so

cause of Poor Fielding
: The management was amateurish from the start, and
was in keeping with the entire show. There was confusion
over seating even the small attendance which was present.
The gallery was a dreary waste of empty benches. When
Gans entered the ring he found McFadden had pre-empted
the lucky corner. Gans refused to go to the opposite cor
ner, as it was wet from the water which had been slopped
about. Gans took a seat on the same side of the ring as
McFadden. An effort was made to get some resin when
it developed the management had not provided any for the
fighters. The fight then went on with both men in adjoin
ing corners Instead of opposite one another, as the rules
require.- . ; " ' .
"Willie Borne was given the decision over Eddie O'Con
nor in four rounds. Neither could fight, O'Connor being
theveriest novice.* "
Finally Miller took a firm hold of Lewis' neck with both
hands and lifted him off his feet and hurled* him through the
air. Lewis lay on his back and could not rise. McDevitt
motioned to Miller and the latter thought he had been
awarded the fight. Finally when McDevitt could make him
self understood he gave the bout to Lewis on a foul.
Each with only one arm free the fighters struggled des
perately all over the ring. Sometimes they were inside the
ropes and again they were outside, but they never let up.
Twice Miller had Lewis across the ropes and it seemed the
colored tfoxe'r would be broken in twain. For the greater
part of the time it was a three-cornered scrap, as Referee
McDevitt was in the thick of the conflict. Once he was
dazed with a blow over the eye and again he formed part
of the. fighting, struggling mass on the floor.
Those who love the quick action and the excitement of a
saloon Ibrawl would say the fight between Henry Lewis and
Herman Miller, Gans'. sparring partner, was a pippin. It
was an ordinary d.ub fight until the fourth round. Miller
was then sent in with instructions to rough it and thus
outgame the negro. The first time Lewis led with his left
Miller caught his glove under his arm. Then ensued one
of the most remarkable exhibitions of rough house tactics
ever seen in any ring. . Everything went except biting, and
the presence of Police Captain Anderson was the only thing
that prevented that being included.
Woodward's Pavilion ring seems to be the graveyard of
the reputations of the one-time stars of the lightweight
division. First came Jack O'Brien, whose star as a boxer
set forever after his showing there with Turner. Immedi
ately in his train came George Lavigne, the greatest man
of his Inches that ever pulled on a padded glove. He will
never fight again. 'Now conies McFadden, whose face bears
the scars of a hundred battles. The hand of man could
never send him into the ring again fit to battle for his life.
It was generally understood Gans could not make 133
pounds, the stipulated, weight. The men were weighed In
privately. Referee Phil Wand being the only outsider in
attendance. He says the scales were set at 133 pounds and
neither boxer raised the beam. This either means the
weights were juggled with or that the men were well in
side the lightweight limit.
they could offer no excuse except to say that his work
was so bad as to be unexplainable. The betting was 10 to 4
in favor of Gfans. But little money was -wagered, not
enough to make it an object to fake.
Completely Outclasses McFadden and Never Allows
Him to'- Get -.Into- Action.
THE most unsatisfactory f.ght in years."
This was the consensus of opinion among the
spectators in Woodward's Pavilion last night, when
Joe Gans, conceded to be the cleverest boxer in tha
ring to-day, completely outclassed George McFad
den. This was the seventh meeting of the rival light
weights. In all previous ones McFadden held his own,
making a brave stand against the colored .wonder. . The
last time they met was In Denver two years ago this com
ing October.
Since then Gans has been on the upgrade arid. has, ap
parently, not yet reached the zenith of his power. Mc-
Fadden, on the other hand, has obviously been on the'
down grade. The contrast last night was a pitiable one.
There was never a moment from . the time the gong
sent them together until George Tuthlll threw up the
sponge in the third round when McFadden had a chance.
He could not get "set," in the parlance of the ring, and
did not deliver one effective blow. Gans, with his mar
velous ability as a boxer, was -all oven McFadden from l :
the first moment.
They feinted a few moments, when Gans sent & crush
ing blow to the head. From that time on it was a stake
horse against a galling plater. Gans scored right andleft to
the head at will. He wrestled McFadden to the floor after
they had been going two minutes. Â¦ McFadden's legs,
seemed stuck in soft asphaltum, as he could hardly, raise
them from the floor. He stood as though rooted to the
padded ring. It seemed the fight would not last one round
when Gans sent a right and left to the head, followed
by another right that seemed capable of felling an ox.
He kept this rap'.d fire up for nearly a minute and it was
a miracle McFadden did not succumb to it. . At times it
seemed Gans did not take advantage of all his chances.
Before the second round had fairly started there was
a concerted movement of the spectators toward the door.
They were all on their feet yelling "Fake! fake! fake!" at
the top of their voices. Gans had McFadden wabbling
early In the round and scored two clean knockdowns.
In the third and last round Gahs punished McFadden
terribly. He knocked him clean off his feet with a right
to the jaw. McFadden was no sooner up than he was
knocked down again. He was up again and staggered to
the center of the ring-. He tried to hang- on,
But the elusive Gans seemed never where he expected to
to find him. McFadden was knocked down twice before the
end of the round. George Tuthlll then threw up the sponge
and ended the farce.
There were all manner of rumors flying about. One had
it that McFadden did not try to win, as the Easterners
were anxious to draw Jimmy Britt into a match with
Gans. Britt has drawn the color line, the danger line
Hereford calls it, and says he will not fight a negro. If
McFadden fought his best last night Britt could have been
blindfolded and whip him.
McFatiden's trainers were crestfallen after the fight.
They left their man to his own resources and when asked
for an explanation simply said: "There he. is; look at him
yourself and see if you can tell what is the matter with
him." They said his final work had been satisfactory and

a Strong Gam^ to Defend
His Title With Success
Huhlm Wants the "Winner.
LONDON, June 27.â Gus Ruhlln, who
defeated Tom Sharkey before the Na
tional Sporting Club last Wednesday,
challenged the winner of the approaching
Jeffries-Fitzsimmons contest at San Fran
- Cisco, to fight either In England or the
United States.
THE second annual tennis tournament
for the championship of the State of
California will be played on the
courts of the Hotel Rafael, San Ra
fael, July 2, 3 and 4. It will be a scratch
singles event, open to all. Play will com
mence at 10:30 a. m. Wednesday. The
final match for the championship will be
played at 2:30 o'clock on the 4th. On the
morning of the 4th there will be a conso
lation doubles tournament for the benefit
of those beaten in their first match. Two
silver cups have been donated for the
championship event, and suitable prizes
for the consolation.
Beals Wright, who is ranked second in
the United States this year, may possibly
play here next week. It was Mr. Wright's
Intention to come to California in July,
but It is not known whether he will ar
rive in time to take part in tha tourna
ment. His presence in the tournament
would add greatly to the interest of both
the players and the spectators. When
the Easterners were here three years ago
Champion Whitney was not at his best,
and ever since has been anxious to re
deem himself. He was beaten easily try
Wright, who in turn was beaten by Sum
ner Hardy. Wright has Improved in the
last two years, and the majority think
Whitney would have no chance against
the clever Easterner.
The cracks have been practicing hard
for the last two weeks for next week's
event. George Whitney, the present cham
pion, has done little practicing during the
year up to the present week. Whitney is
not playing as strong a game as he was
k year ago. and some ot the first class
men have been improving steadily. Next
to the champion those having the best
chance of winning are R. N. Whitney,
Grant Smith, Drummond "MacGavin and
W. B. Collier. MacGavin is frlaylng a
strong game at present and is always
dangerous. If he has a good day next
week the cracks will have to play their
best to beat him. Collier, who is noted
for his staying powers, plays well in the
lieat. As all the matches will be the best
three sets in live and the players will be
called upon to play two matches each
day endurance is likely to prevail over
skill. R. N. Whitney is playing a strong
game at present, but is not expected to
last through the tournament.
The first annual tournament for the
championship of San Mateo County will
be played on the 3d and 4th of July on
the Hotel Mateo courts. A silver chal
lenge cup has been donated, which must
be won twice successively. Play will be
gin on the 3d and the finals will be played
o.i the afternoon of the 4th. Oniy those
who have lived in the county for -at least
two months prior to July will be allowed
to compete. â¢ All matches but the finals
vill be two sets out of tnree; finals three
out of five.
The park tournament last Sunday
brought out some clever tennis. In the
first class the match between Will Allen
and Harry Routh was easily the best
ever seen on the public courts. Routh
showed great improvement, and would
probably have won had he been in better
ccndition. This makes the second victory
for Allen, who needs but one more to re
tain the cup permanently. Charles Dun
lap has won the trophy once.
In the second class play was also spir
ited. Five men are still in the fight,
which will be resumed to-morrow. Griffin
v-111 play Touchard, and Foley will meet
the winner of the match between Black
and Adams. Griffin and Touchard are two
of the youngest players on the public
courts and are rapidly forging to the
front. They are the best In their class
and the winner of their match will prob
ably be the winner of the tournament.

The construction of the isthmian canal will of

Those who are best fitted to calculate beforehand
the probable effects of the proposed waterway upon
the fortunes of the Pacific Coast of the United
States have been uniformly sanguine of great bene
fits. With. their speculations and estimates the pub-
There appears no reason to doubt that the irriga
tion bill will prove as conducive and perhaps as
potent to the upbuilding of the arid West as was the
homestead bill to the settlement of the prairie States.
Its good results are to be widely spread, far-reach
ing and permanent. For a time of course the work
of providing irrigation will not progress rapidly, but
when the improved lands are put upon the market
and the revenues derived from them pass into the
treasury to be used for further irrigation and the im
provement of additional lands, the settlement of the'
now arid States can hardly, fail to progress with
rapidity.
We have for so long a time been engaged in advo
cating the construction of a canal and the irrigation
of arid lands that now that victory has come it finds
the people comparatively indifferent. The pleasures
of success, in fact, have been to a large extent anti
cipated. With each succeeding Congress 'since first
the contest began something has been gained by the
promoters of each of the two enterprises, and con
sequently when this Congress assembled it was al
most a foregone conclusion that we would have at
least one of the two amply provided for. In fact,
so certain were the masses of the" people that the
time for the enactment of an isthmian canal bill had
come that failure to pass it would have been counted
as a neglect of duty. , The country, therefore, accepts
the act very much as a matter of course, and has not
felt the exultation over the victory that would have
been felt some years ago had success been attained
then.^ V :>''-â¢
WHILE this Congress, has not enacted all
the legislation that was expected of it at
this session, it has done enough to assure
it a high place in the annals of American history.
Without counting lesser measures of importance to
the country at this time, the enactment of two such
bills as those providing for the irrigation of the arid
lands of the West and the construction of the isth
mian canal in itself gives to this Congress a rank
that will' make it memorable for all generations to
come. . -Â¦Â¦ >; "&>-

The chief drawback- to Dawson at present^s the
increasing cost of fuel. The wood in the neighbor
hood and along the river is being rapidly consumed
Last winter the price was $15 per cord uncut and tm
sawed, so that the cost to . the consumer . averaged
about $22 a cord. Persistent search: is being, made
for coal and for the gold-bearing quart2, and in time
both will doubtless be discovered. Then Dawson will
enter upon a new era of development arid ,haye an
assured future for many years to come.
The Canadian Government . has done a good deal
to facilitate the development of the' territory by the
construction of roads, and the Consul reports that
every important creek or other locality within a
radius\of fifty miles has now been made accessible
from Dawson by a good wagon road. At the close
of 190 1 there were over 196 miles of such roads in
use, and additional . mileage is being constructed
These will of course greatly facilitate the develop-'
ment of the gold fields, and, taken in connection with
the improved methods of mining,' will add to the
profits obtained from the industry.
In the first place the Consul says the report that a
business panic prevails at Dawson and that the
miners are deserting the creeks "i3..false."~~ He adds:
"From personal investigation I am able to say that
the business men of this community have the utmost
confidence in the future of the territory and are mak
ing preparations for a busy season. ' I have within
the past few weeks visited all the creeks on which the
principal mining claims are located, to wit, Bonanza,
El Dorado, Dominion, Sulphur, Gold Run "and
Hunker, and I find that mining operations are
progressing satisfactorily and are being conducted
with modern machinery and improved methods, re
sulting in a much larger output of pay. dirt than in
former years." '
CONSUL SAYLOR at Dawson has furnished
the State Department with a Teport on af

as some of the boom reports occasionally given out,

MORE TROUBLE BREWING.
Even if that story be untrue, or badly exaggerated,
the very fact that it circulates shows that within the
ranks of the reorganizes themselves there are fac
tions and dissensions. Bryan is not the only Demo
crat who has a knife for Hill, nor is Tammany Hall
the only foe he has to confront in his own city.
There are conservative Democrats who remember
his method of running the party in the old days
when he had the machinery, and they are not going
to permit him to get control again if they can pre
vent it Cleveland may not be among the number
who are making the fight, but, as the New York
story shows, his name is being used to help it on.
While New York Democracy is thus turning ban
quets into brawls that of Ohio is engaged in equally
exciting sport. The old fight between the faction of
Tom L. Johnson and that of John R. McLean has
broken out with new vigor. Johnson is reported to
have said recently that McLean "stands for nothing
in Ohio politics. His opposition would be of more
benefit to the party than his support. Great num
bers of independent voters will be attracted to the
Democratic party if ii i s known that the party will
rot be supported by McLean, men who would never
vote with a party known to be controlled by such a
man."
Of course McLean will say of Johnson about the
same that Johnson has said of McLean. Thus Ohio,
no more than New York, can furnish a harmony ex
ample for the party. In Illinois the row between
the Harrison and the Hopkins factions is as bad as
that in cither of the other States. Mr. Olney has
emphatically declared he is not in the race, so New
England has no leader to offer. It looks as if Bryan
might get another nomination by the simple process
of staying out of fights and letting his foes kill one
another. However, Bryan cannot keep out of a fac
tion fight, and when the ruction is over his scalp
along with those of Hill, McLean, Johnson, Harri
son and Hopkins, may be found at the belt of the
victor.
One of the political experts in discussing the situa
tion explained the banquet incident in this way:
"Mr. Cleveland is fearful that the Democratic party,
if it should elect a President, would fall absolutely
under the domination of Hill, whom he knows so
well. It was to prevent Hill's plans from coming to
full fruition that he consented to speak at the open
ing of the Tilden Club. At the Tilden Club he got
back into touch with many of his former friends
throughout the Stateâ men whom Hill must have
with him in order to wjn. * * * Mr. Cleveland
does not care to prevent Hill from running the State
organization. As a matter of fact, he could not if
he wanted to. But he has served notice on the sage
of Wolferts Roost that the next State convention
must be 'unbossed.' That is the significance of Bor
ough President Cantor's visit to Princeton on Mon
day and his return the same night with copies of Mr.
Cleveland's speech in his pocket"
AS might have been expected, the visit of Mr.
Cleveland to New York to attend , the Tilden
Club banquet has not been permitted to pass
with politicians for just what appeared on the sur
face. Cleveland said in his address that he attended
the banquet merely as an admirer of Tilden who has
an ardent desire to see the Democratic party return
to the Tilden platform. The politicians of New York
scoff at that as an insufficient explanation. They will
have it that Cleveland went to the banquet for the
purpose of heading off David Bennett Hill's effort
to obtain the leadership of the anti-Tammany
Democracy in New York and the anti-Bryan
Democracy in the Union.

A notable feature of-the report is the estimate of
the merchant that Cape Town will not be able to
hold the position of leadings port of the .country. Jn
fact, he says "Cape Town is out of the - reckoning."
He believes Durban will get the great bulk of the in
terior trade and become the commercial metropolis.
In conclusion he says:. "Taking South Africa as a
whole, the country will go ahead in coming years
and a big future lies before it. As to the immediate
trade outlook, the impressions gathered from my
visit are distinctly hopeful, tinctured with the fear
that* it will be overdone." \
In addition to the figures cited the bureau reports
also a statement made by a leading merchant to the
British South African ' Export Gazette concerning
the prospects for future "trade. V He is quoted as say
ing: "With the advent of peace there will undoubt
edly be a great boom all through, the country. 'A
lull consequent on the removal of part- of the military
forces and the refugees may; perhaps affect the trade
of Cape Town, which-is, and always will remain, more
or less local, and concerned with the western districts
of Cape Colony; but noUsuch effect will be felt else
where, for it will be necessary for some considerable
time to' keep a" large military force in the country,
and this will as a consequence involve a' continuance
of a considerable amount; of "military expenditure.
Large camps will be set -, up at v ; certain - : points.- I
have no doubt as to the certainty, of: the boom which
will supervene after the war; but my only misgiving
is that, with every one rushing in to' secure a share,
it will be overdone, and 'a reaction set in."
According to a statement just issued by the Treas
ury Bureau of Statistics exports", from the United
States to Africa during the month of April were
larger than those to all South America, and were
more than 50 per cent greater than "those of April in
the preceding year. ; For the ten months ending with
April, 1902, they amounted to $28,956,179, against
$22,070,132 in the corresponding ten months of the
fiscal year 1901, and $15,858,286 in the corresponding
months of 1900. The chief increase of course is to
British Africa, which takes about- 85 per cent of our
exports to Africa. To British Africa alone dtir ex
ports during the month of April, 1902, were $2,763,
833, against $1,817,101 in : April, icx)7; '; and for the
ten months ending with April,. 1002, were $24,708,612,
against $18,437,315 in ten months of 1901 and $13,
168,062 in ten months of i960. .â¢
WHILE the British Government is figuring
how to provide for the settlement of af
fairs in South Africa and the restoration of
trade and industry our own has the
more satisfactory task of noting that" American com-'
merce with that country has shown a marked in
crease during the past year and promises a larger
increase in the immediate future.
PERSONAL MENTION.
MARTIN ARMSTRONG, station agent on the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe
road at Kenny, Tex., has invented an appliance by which any person
; mayfeend a telegraphic messag3 without knowing anything about teleg
raphy. The apparatus is intended primarily for use in educating people
to be telegraphers, and with it they can, without a teacher, master the
secret of. dots and dashes that go to make up each letter of the alphabet ac
cording to the Morse system.
The outfit, which can be carried in the hand, consists of a sounder key. such
as is used in all telegraphic work, a small dry battery, a transmitter, stylus
and the wires that cannect the various parts. It is the transmitter that ia the
wonderful thing about the whole apparatus. This Is simply a piece of wood
about 12 inches long and 8 wide. Extending along one side of the board are
all the letters of the alphabet; followed by the numerals 1 to 0 and the punc
tuation characters. Under each one of these characters there is a little hole
or depression In the wood. Below these holes again there is a geometrical pat
tern formed by strips of metal set Into the wood, with a minute groove lead
ing from each character through the metal strips and the wood that at intervals
breaks their continuity. Â¦
The .stylus, which, looks like an ordinary pencil, and all the other parts of
the apparatus are connected with the battery by wires. The novice sets the~ap
paratus on a table before him and takes the stylus in his hand. Inserting its
pofnt in the groove running from the letter he wishes to make, he draws it to
ward him. As.it moves the sounder clicks the letter. This is done by the stylus
passing over the metal strips and forming an electrical connection,- which 13
broken for longer or shorter intervals necessary to make a letter by the in
tervening space of wood between the metal strips. A few weeks of practice on
this instrument and the novice knows the sound of every letter, and It is only
then a matter of practice to receive and transmit in the usual manner The
sounder gives him. his opportunity to practice this, and if . he is ever in' doubt
as to his correctness he can verify his work by producing the letter with the
Telegraphers say it is the most ingenious as well as the simplest arrange
ment they ever saw by means of which to learn telegraphy. Railroad men who
have looked at it value it from another standpoint. One general manager of
a railway says It will prove of great value in railroad work. By having one
on every train in case of a wreck the conductor will be enabled by throwing
a wire over the telegraph wires along the road, to at once communicate with
the train dispatcher of the division.' telling where he is and the nature of the
casualty. . The conductor need not know anything about telegraphy to transmit
a message slowly, but with perfect. accuracy. transmit
Armstrong began work on his Invention six months ago. Tears aeo h*Â» mw
a telegrapher, but he abandoned this work for photography and was estah
lished in business at Belasco, Tex., when the great Galveston hurricane came
along. The town was forty-five miles south of Galveston and was swept out of
existence. Armstrong was ruined and counted himself lucky to escane with hÂ£
life. He went back to his old business and set his wits to work in dev sfn^I
method of learning telegraphy without a teacher. His invention Is the result.

This country was not free as long as the French
treaty lasted. We were not made free by the peace
treaty of 1783, and were not free when the constitu
tion of 1789 was adopted and Washington became
President. What France expected to do to us and
be to us under that treaty, from which the Platt
amendment is copied, was revealed in the episode in
which the Citizen Genet figured so largely. Sent
here as "the diplomatic representative of France, he
landed at Charleston and proceeded to make a sort
of imperial progress through the country, assuming
the airs and authority of a Lord Paramount, as the
representative of our suzerain. He was bundled
back to France and we tore the treaty in tatters.
One republic should not be suzerain over another.
Let the Platt amendment be abrogated, or fall into
innocuous desuetude/ -
The statement of the condition of independence
was made for all peoples, and for all time, by Mr.
Jefferson in our own Declaration of Independence.
We violated that condition flagrantly in our French
treaty of offensive and defensive alliance made in
1778, wherein we put ourselves in exactly the-posi
tion Cuba was forced into by the Platt amendment.
In 1793 we found that the suzerainty of France was
incompatible with our freedom and inconsistent with
our Declaration of Independence, and we proceeded
to cast it off by violating the treaty of 1778 and mak
ing just such a trade treaty with Great Britain as
Cuba proposes.
Here appears the political interplay of which we
have spoken. It at once becomes a question in our
domestic politics whether we will assent to real Cu
ban independence by abrogating the Platt amend
ment entirely. It will be observed that to let that
piece of Machiavelian statesmanship stand intact,
and thereunder hold Cuba's independence subject to
our will, is to sustain the hypocritical pretense that
she is free, and to also give color of right to the as
sertion that we are under obligations to her. No
nation is independent that is not free to treat with
all other nations or to refuse to treat with any in
international conventions.
Soon will be heard the complaint that such a
treaty with England as is proposed will violate the
Platt amendment. T.hat sinister and un-American
condition which we imposed upon Cuba by a prom
ise made in the War Department that we would give
her free trade, or, in the evasive grandiloquence of
phrase used, "incorporate her into our commercial
system," provides that our consent shall be -Neces
sary to Cuba's international action. This means that
she is to have no treaties nor trade nor relations with
any nation but us! Yet we pretend that we have
made her independent! "
Indeed we applaud the Cuban plan of initiating
and influencing an economic policy. It is far supe
rior to the anomaly that has insulted our people, de
graded our institutions and injured the administra
tion for some time past in the brazen effrontery of
the War Department appearing as the authoritative
dictator of our economic legislation.
We are quite sure that the American sugar plant
ers and producers of all kinds are perfectly willing
that Cuba shall make a trade treaty with England.
If planters' meetings- and resolutions are potent all
the sugar planters of this country will be willing to
meet and petition our Senate and President not to
make a free trade treaty, or partial free trade treaty,
with Palma, or any reciprocity treaty that is out of
line with the Republican platform, which . calls for
reciprocity only affecting such things as we do not
produce.
THE interplay of Cuban and American politics
has begun. The island planters who main
tained the junta in Washington have met and
by resolution urged President Palma to make a trade
treaty with Great Britain. Great care is taken to ac
company the announcement of this action with the
statement that it is caused by the failure of our Con
gress to give the planters free access to our
markets.

Tracy and Merrill Again Seen.
WINLOCK, Wash., June 27.â Tracy and
Merrill, the escaped Oregon convicts,
were seen near here at noon to-day, both
heavily armed.
The witness said that on another occa
sion Nelson called his attention to the
resemblance between himself and his son
Other former friends of the rich old
bachelor testified that Nelson had ac
knowledged the paternity of the plaintiff.
"Did you ever hear Hubbard Nelson
say anything in the presence of Mrs.
Harrison in regard to his relation to
Walfer Harrison?" he was asked.
"Yes," replied the witness. "Mrs. Har
rison and Nelson were in my store to
gether with the little boy. Nelson placed
the boy upon the counter and asked me*
'How is that for a Nelson?' I took Nel
son down to the cellar to have a drink
and while there Nelson told me the boy
was his son and heir."
WILLOWS, June 27.â Strong testimony
In support of Walter Harrison's claim to
the 5150,000 estate of H. W. C. tfelson
was given to-day by former neighbors of
the late capitalist. Witnesses testified
that the young man was recognized by
the decedent as his son. A. Papst, an old
resident of this county, told of having
frequently seen Nelson and Mrs. Harri
son together.

All Christian Endeavorerg ''know
"Pansy" from her writings, so Mrs. Alden
needed no introduction. She was given
an ovation and the Chautauqua salute.
For a half hour she addressed the congre
gation, and their interest was unflagging
as she took up the objections that wcr-s
offered by the critics of junior endeavor
work and punctured them one by one.
Miss Jessie Flook, the junior State su
perintendent, modestly told of- the work
that is so close to her heart. . "Entreat
Me Not to Leave Thee" was ' sung by
Miss Stanley Bliss. Mrs. E. W. Dodge
the superintendent of junior work for the
Chicago Christian Endeavor Union, gave
greetings from her city. H. R. Chapman
At 9 o'clock the service was turned over
to the intermediates and juniors. Miss
Jessie Flook of Santa Ana, State junijr
superintendent, and Marshall Black 1 of
Palo Alto, State Intermediate superin
tendent, occupied seats on the platform,
as did the society junior and inter
mediate superintendents present. The
best praise service of. the convention was
led by Charles MV Richards, a San Jose
intermediate. Miss Lottie Moore, junior
superintendent of the Golden Gate Union,
led an inspiring devotional service.
Little Walter Byrne, on behalf" of the
Santa Cruz Juniors, in good voice and
with appropriate words, welcomed the
other juniors. The response was by a
Santa Ana junior, Miss Amy Mead, who
gave a line address. . Then followed ad
dresses by Miss Edna Guin of Emmanuel
Presbyterian Church, Los Angeles; Calvin
Morcom of Central Methodist Episcopal
Cl.urch, San Francisco; Miss Hilda Heth
erton of the Presbyterian church, Wat
sonville, and Erret Shelton of the Chris
tian church, San Jose.
Ex-President William G. Alexander, the
most successful worker among the inter
mediates, conducted a round table and
answered all questions In a manner that
contributed many helpful thoughts and
much information. . The sweet singer,
Miss McMillan, favored the immense con
gregation with a solo.
Mr. and Mrs. Henry A. Fisk of San
Francisco, who work among the boys and
girls who have only the curbstone for
their playground, spoke on "Social Settle
ment Work for Boys and Girls." They
like to term it "gospel settlement work,"
as they firmly believe that morality and
religion cannot be divorced. After their
addresses the Mandarin quartet sang
"The Holy City."
SANTA CRUZ, June 27.â The
juniors and intermediates claimed
to-day as their day at the Chris
tian Endeavor and
the' already large delegation was
swelled by 100, who came from Watson
vl'.le. "A Child Shall Lead Them" was
the theme of the morning and the time
was devoted to the children. The quiet
hour and Bible study was conducted by
E. H. Baker of San Jose.
But San Francisco and New Orleans
are the only cities of the largest thirty
cities In the country which do not have
municipal ownership of their water sup
ply. Only Chicago, Detroit, Allegheny
and Columbus, however, own their own
electric light plants.
The public debt of San Francisco is ab
normally low, being exceeded by 117 cities
in the United States. It is only $800,000,
while that of Cleveland, which is about
the same size, is $16,000,000.
San Francisco is the fifth city in the
assessed value of her property, lead
ing St. Louis, Baltimore, Cleveland
and Buffalo, all of which exceed her
in population. She has a lower tax levy
t$lfÂ» 30 per $1000) than any of the first
thirty cities, except Boston, but she is
tenth in her annual receipts,. $3,800,000.
In addition to this municipal research
work Mr. Foster is engaged in some rou
tine work of the Department of Labor,
consisting in the collection of data con
cerning the scales of wages, the prices
of commodities, etc., paid in the West.
In regard to this portion of his work
Mr. Foster said:
â¢ ""We try not to give any conclusions;
merely to obtain., sift and publish the
facts. This work has been carried on
not only in our own country but also to
a limited extent in foreign countries, par
ticularly Mexico."
San Francisco is third in the area of
her public parks, being excelled by only
New York and Philadelphia. She is also
third in the number of patients cared for
in hospitals, only New York and Boston
surpassing her, and fifth in the number
of miles of street railwaysâ 240 miles.
San Francisco is within the size of her
regular fire department, but, according to
the last annual report, her loss by fire,
amounting to about $500,000, was exceeded
by that of fifteen cities, while the four
cities nearest her â Cleveland, Buffalo,
Cincinnati and Pittsburg â each suffered a
loss of 11,000,000.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, June 27.â
Jchn M. Foster, acting special agent of
the United States Labor Department, has
concluded some Interesting investigations
of conditions in San Francisco. He has
been at work since last October compil
ing statistics of cities west of the Rocky
Mountains having a population of 30,000
or more. In the course of his tour ne
has already visited Butte, Spokane, Se
attle, Tacoma, Portland, Salt Lake City,
Denver, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Oak
land and San Francisco, and will return
to "Seattle next week to continue his in
vestigations, there. The result of his
work will be published by the Govern
ment printing office next September. A
number of features interesting to San
Franciscans are brought out by this com
parative etudy.
San Francisco is the ninth city in the
country in population. Baltimore, Cleve
land and Buffalo rank immediately above
It, while Cincinnati and Pittsburg are a
little smaller. San Francisco has the
largest harbor of any American city, its
area amounting to nearly 50,000 acres. Of
the 137 cities in the country having popu
lations above 30,000, eighty-five have a
higher birth rate and thirty-five a high
er death rate than San Francisco, her
death rate amounting to about 2 per cent
ot the entire population. Â¦ Â«

SAN JOSE, June 27.â The Southern Pa
cific is to have competition in the freight
business of the Pajaro Valley. Council
man "W. J. Rogers of this elty has pro
moted a project, which he claims he will
have no trouble in financing, for cheaper
rates between Pajaro Valley points and
San Francisco. His project is the build
ing of an electric railway from Watson
ville to a point on the coast a little north
of what is known as Ooodalls Camp.
There suitable wharfage and warehouses
will be built. A line of steamers will ply
between this ocean terminus and San
Francisco. The electrio line will be
about four miles In length. From the
wharf to San Francisco the distance is
but eighty miles and it la planned that
steamers shall make a round trip each
way every twelve hours.
Rogers declares the construction Is
assured and that within a year the peo
ple in the vicinity qf Watsonvllle will be
enjoying better transportation facilities
than that afforded by the railway. lid

sonvllle district and was assured suffi
cient business to pay for building of tha

SEATTLE, June 27.â The Alaskan liner
Roanoke, Captain Weaver, which reached
port this mofning from Nome, having
sailed from that place three days after
the Ohio, brings no authoritative news of
the steamships Jeanle and Portland,
which, when last seen, were being carried
by an ice pack toward the 'Arctic. On
June 18, when the Roanoke pulled out for
Seattle, the Dora had returned from her
trip northward along the. coast and
brought a report that the natives . above
Cape Prince of Wales had found the
wreckage of a large steamship. No
credence, however, was placed In the re
port at Nome, for the simple reason that
it was not backed by substantial evidence.
Naturally, though, to those vitally inter
ested In the fate of the Portland, the story
was anything but reassuring.
The fleet now searching after" the miss
ing vessels has been reinforced by the ad
dition of the revenue cutter Daniel Man
ning. Should any tangible report reach
Nome, a number of the large craft In the
harbor would be instantly dispatched to
assist in the rescue. Probably a number
of the remaining steamers at Nome will
have gone by j this timo , to aid In tha
search. . . ;,v-" . Â¦ Â¦
At Nome It was believed that there were
but two theories by which the steamship
Jeanle could be considered as still afloat.
She might either have been caught in the
Ice and carried northward, or, in making
her way< over toward the Siberian coast,
have been disabled by some accideht
probably striking a piece of Ice, and made
for some harbor, on that coast for safety
In case the damage was such that it could
have been repaired, it is likely that the
missing vessel la still lying at anchor or
Is on the beach in some protected cove
and will not be heard from for some time
Being unusually stanch and seaworthy'
the Jeanle could have become entangled in
the Ice pack and escaped where many
other vessels would have been ground Into
kindling wood.

flicting a wound that will cause death.
Policeman Alvord observed a revolver in
the man's pocket, and after consulting
with Officer Jessup determined upon his
arrest. Campbell turned into a side street,
followed by Alvord, who requested him to
halt. The stranger made a defiant retort,
whereupon the officer ordered him to
throw up his hands, at .the same time
drawing his revolver.
The supposed desperado attempted to
draw his revolver, at the same time seiz
ing the officer's weapon. Alvord fired,
the ball striking the man in the pit of
the stomach and passing clear through
his body.
A terrible fight followed, .the wounded
man all the time holding on to the of

" Deab Mrs. Pinkham : â I feel it my duty to -write and let you know tha
good you and your Vegetable Compound are doing. I had been sick ever since
my first- baby was born, and at the birth of my second, my doctor, as well as
myself thought I should never Â¦> live through it. After that menstrua-
tion never came regular and when it came I suffered terribly. I also had
womb and ovarian trouble. A friend of my husband's advised him "to get
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound for me. At first I had no
faith in it, but now nothing could induce me to be without it. Menstruation
has become regular and I feel like a new woman. Your medicine is a God-
send to suffering women. I hope this letter will lead others to try Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. Yours truly, Mss. Milpbto

This is the standing of Mrs. Pinkham among the women of America to-

After years of struggle to attain public confidence, with a firm and stead-
fast belief that some day others will recognize in us the truth, good faith and

Chief Wittman received a dispatch yes
terday . afternoon from Detective T. B.
Gibson at Sedro Wooley, Wash., to tha
following effect: "John Flax, alias Ben
nett, is not Charles B. Hadley, the man
wanted for the Nora Fuller murder. The
man they have here in custody is suffer
ing from delirium tremens. He has given
me his full history, which I will give you
when I return. I will leave for home in
the morning."
Not Nora Fuller's Murderer.
The two returned to the jail, where
Bennett was again placed behind the bars.
Gibson then declared that the man was a
fraud, and was not Bennett nor Hadley.
To-night the prisoner was released.
"Why, don't I go with you?" Bennett
quickly asked, but to this interrogatory
the detective made no reply.
Later in the afternoon Gibson again ap
peared at the Jail, procured the keys from
the Marshal and unlocked the cell in
which Bennett was confined and together
they left the building. They visited the
cigar factory where Bennett worked
when he first came to the city, and at
Gibson's direction Bennett neatly made a
couple of cigars.
"You've got me up here on this wild
goose chase," remarked the detective,
"and I want something to take back to
San Francisco."
Gibson reached Sedro Wooley this after
noon. Local officers who were waiting at
the station for him when the train from
the south rolled in failed to recognize him
and he did not make his identity known.
In fact, it was only through the efforts of
The Call representative that it was
learned that Gibson had arrived. Marshal
Munro was notified and proceeded to his
office in the city jail, where Gibson joined
him a few minutes later and the two were
closeted in a secret Â¦ conference lasting
nearly an hour. In the meantime news
of the arrival of the detective had spread
through the city and a crowd congregated
in the vicinity of the town jail. With
the evident idea of avoiding this crowd
Gibson, when he emerged from the Mar
shAl's office, took a roundabout way i and
reached the jail from the rear. He at
once entered the building and even Mar
shal Munro was not permitted in the cell
while Gibson interviewed the prisoner.
The interview lasted more than an hour.
SEDRO WOOLEY, Wash., June 27.â
Detective Thomas- Gibson of San Francis
co arrived here to-day to inquire Into the
identity of the man who surrendered to
Town Marshal Munro several days ago,,
claiming that he was the murderer of
Nora Fuller. As a result of the detec
tive's visit the prisoner was released to
night. The pseudo Bennett proved to b*Â»
just what The Call several days ago' said
he wasâ a clgarmaker named John Flax,
who has been working in cities of Oregon
and Washington for months' past. Why
he posed as the murderer of Nora Fuller
can only be conjectured, but it is the
opinion of. Detective Gibson that the fel
low was suffering from delirium tremens
and that the murder story was a product
of his excited imagination. It is likely
too, from remarks made by Flax this aft
ernoon, that he was seeking a free trip
to San Francisco.

announced that in a few days a letter will
be addressed by the ' Governor to the
heads of departments setting forth Gov

The decision of the Governor has creat

A smiie of triumph came over the pris
oner's face, and, after thanking the
Judge, jury and District Attorney, he
walked out to breathe the free air for*the
first time in two years.
Begerow's crime and many trials have
attracted a great deal of attention. At
the time of the picnic he was- constable
at Alviso. He placed a man known as
â¢'Bismarck" under arrest and Cech and
Berger Interfered in the man's behalf.
A row ensued and Begerow drew his re
volver, fired one shot into the air and
then shot Cech and Berger dead. He
pleaded self-defense. " He was arrested
and a mob used him roughly. It was
Claimed he was drunk at the time.
â¢ lhe first trial was brought to a close
by Juror Benjamin disappearing just as
the case was to go to the Jury. Four
other trials resulted in disagreements.
The case was twice before the Supreme
Court and once that court ordered Bege
row released because he was not brought
tu tr i al ,S n tIme - He was at once rear
rested. The Brewers' Union engaged spe
cial counsel to prosecute him.
Judge Lorigan said that, after the five
trials, four of which had resulted in dis
agreements, it was plainly an impossibil
ity to convict the defendant. He then or
dered the charges dismissed and Begerow'
released.
Judge Lorigan at once discharged the
jury. District Attorney Campbell then
moved that the two charges of murder
against Begerow be dismissed and the de
fendant discharged from custody. At the
seme time he filed a statement that he
had prepared in regard to the case. It
detailed the crime in full, the inability to
obtain a conviction and the many dis
agreements.
SAN JOSE. June 27.â After five times
facing a jury on murder, charges,' ex-Con
stable Frederick Begerow of Alviso, who
shot and killed Joseph Cech and August
I'-erger at the picnic of the San Francisco
Breweries' employes in this city on July
J5, 1900, walked out of court a free man
this evening. The Jury, after having been
out two days and nights, came into court
and reported that it could not agree on a
verdict. It is said the jurors stood 11 to 1
in favor of acquittal.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
A hint comes by wire from Washington
that an attempt is being engineered to
have the Republican State Convention at
Sacramento next August adopt a plank
indorsing Cuban reciprocity. Congress
man Needham is quoted as saying that
the "rank and file of the party will not
etand tor anything that will weaken the
I-rctectSon policy." It is the opinion of
leading members of the party in this city
that the convention at Sacramento will
i<ot entertain any proposition to break
down or weaken the barrier of protection
There may be talk in Washington to the
effect that fiesire for reciprocity Is very
strong in California, but tne Republicans
at home are not agitating the question
A meeting of the Thirty-fourth District
Primary League Club was held last night
In Duveneck's Hall, corner of Twenty
fcurth and Church streets. The meeting
was well attended. Enthusiastic speeches
were made by Arthur Gruenberg W B
Barber, A. H. Merrill, Norman W. Hall
and others. The following executive com
mittee was appointed: William Gleason.

Metcalf's district is a beautiful .one for
a politician to contemplate. The con
stituency is enlightened. The area is not
extensive. The roads are good and thÂ«s
pecpie are happy. Moreover, the district
is safely Republican. A revolution that
might change the political complexion of
many another Congressional district
would have no effect on tne political
status of the Third, as the domain is so
overwhelmingly Republican in sentiment,
iletcalf has already gained distinction in
Congress. He wields influence and a
larger measure of prestige in public af
fairs awaits him. He is reluctant, there
fore, to let- go of the Congressional bird
m hand for the gubernatorial bird in the
bush. --.Â£.- Â»
Another commotion in Alameda County
may enliven the gubernatorial campaign.
The Third Congressional District Repub
lican Committee is discussing the politi
cal expediency of urging Victor H. Met
calf to enter the contest for the Republi
can nomination to the office of Governor.
The people of Alameda County have no
particular liking for Gage and are not en
thusiastic for Pardee. Wednesday night
a strong telegram was sent to Metcalf
urging him to get In the fight for Gov
ernor. Several messages of a similar
character were forwarded to the Con
Â£! essxnan Thursday. This desultory firing
along the political line may be followed
up with volleys of telegrams. The awak
ening virtue of a telegraphic message is
not underestimated by the Alameda
County politician. No doubt Metcalf Is
somewhat familiar with the tactics of his
constituents and will be prepared for the
general bombardment. Up to date he has
replied in the negative to every sugges
tion that he should enter the guberna
torial arena. He knows that he is firmly
ir trenched in Congress. He knows like
wise that G. R. Lukens and William R.
Davis, of Alameda, Alden Anderson of So
lano and C. M. Belshaw of Contra Costa
are ready to jump into the race for Con
gress the instant he enters the light for

Does a Wondrous Work for a
Lady Who Was Almost
Crazed With Pain and , 1
Suffering.
It is well known that terrible rheuma-
tism, sciatica : and neuralgia cause more
helplessness, acute suffering and agony
than any of the other diseases that aiHict
humanity. The great medicinal virtues
of Paine's Celery Compound make It tho
only trust-worthy specific for the cure of
all forms of rheumatism and neuralgia.
Thousands of strong testimonial letters
from' the most prominent people of tho
land prove that Paine's Celery Compound
has banished these terribly fatal troubles
when all other treatment has failed. Mrs.
Margaret Bethel of Brainerd, Minn., after
thirty years of agonizing tortures, had
a desire to end her life, if it was the will
of heaven; she almost prayed for tha
time to lay it down. Heaven-directed, sha
made use of Paine's Celery Compound,
and 13 enjoying true life once more, Sha
says:
"For thirty years I have been a great
sufferer from neuralgia in the head, and
also with rheumatism In the whole body.
I began taking Paine's Celery Compound
and soon found I was much better. Be-
fore taking the Compound my life was
such a burden that I almost prayed to
lay it ' down. I was bedfast every two
weeks with horrible pain in the head,
back and neck, until I was almost crazed.
I am able to do harder work and more of
it to-day than for twenty-five years. I
ara really enjoying life again, thanks to
Paine's Celery Compound. I am satisfied
that my life has been prolonged many
years by its use."

Still another story of the matter which many
believe is the genuine one 1b that the Grand
Jury has not yet taken Hnal action of any kind
The giet of this report is that on Thursday
afternoon the Jurors, for reasons of conveni
ence, directed District Attorney Allen to. draw
up four or more indictments and bring them
to the Juryroom at 10 o'clock Saturday morn
ing. The Intention was that at that time the
Jury should take a final vote and decide
whether these indictments or any of them
should be returned to the court. If thla report
Is to be credited, and it seems plausible as
any, no indictments have been decided upon
and no decisive action has been taken.
One report which has been accepted by many
as authentic is that no indictments will bÂ«
returned, but that a written report will bÂ«
presented censuring: Assessor Dalton for care
lessness in connection â¢ with order* for the
manufacture of books.
The parties Involved In the case are hot
inclined to discuss the matter until the
Grand Jury makes its formal report. The
Enquirer, however, has an article on the
action of the Grand Jury, in which it en
deavors to put the best face on the jnatter

Ignorance of the transaction seems to

IN CLUTCHES OF THE LAW.
There are many stories afloat. One is
that Daniels went before the Grand ,'ury
and testified that he did not get any of the
money that was paid on the two checks,
but that the money was turned over to
County Assessor Henry P. Dalton. It is
claimed that upon this testimony the In

words. It Is said that Daniels turned
State's evidence.
pass tbe deal upon George Oakes, while
Stedman and Hadley declared that every
thing that they had done had been under
the direction of Daniels.
When it became evident that the Grand
Jury had voted to Indict not only Dalton
and Oakes, but Stedman and Hadley, and
had left Daniels out, notwithstanding the
fact that he was one of those originally
charged with the crime that the Grand
Jury found existed but fastened upon
others, the stock of the editor began to
increase in value.
G. B. Daniels then began to make
<-harges against some of the employes of
his paper. He declared that Russel Sted
man. who first made an affidavit that the
money had been collected for books that
had never been delivered, was responsible
for the trouble, and he added that M. de
L. Hadley. the business manager and sec
retary of the Enquirer, had inspired Sted
man to take this Btep. In these charges,
Dalton joined and the Grand Jury inves
tigation settled down to Daniels accusing
Stedman and Hadley of having betrayed
him Jn his own office. Dalton trying to
Tbe original charges against Henry P.
Dalton and G. B. Daniels were for con
epiring against the treasury of Alameda
County and looting it for their own bene
fit. There ne\-er was any question as to
the fact that $1500 was secured from the
county for books that were never made or
delivered. The only question was who/got
the money.
As soon as Daniels and Dalton were
charged with this conspiracy thev made
counter charges. They both said that
Emil Nusbaumer was behind the charges,
whereupon Emil Nusbaumer replied that
he was, but that it was up to them to
ehow who got the money. As to getting
the money. Nusbaumer said that he did
not know to whom it fell except that it
did not drop in his pocket*.
OAKLAND, June 27.â How G. B.
Daniels, the general manager and
president of the Oakland Enquirer
Publishing Company, escaped in
dictment for assisting in securing
51500 from the treasury of Alameda Coun
ty -without giving any return therefor, and
how M. de L. Hadley and Russel Stedman
came to be indicted when they were the
ones who made theâ original charges
against Daniels and H. P. Dalton. is one
of the stories that is agitating Alameda
County politically, commercially and Jour
nalistically. Because Daniels escaped in
dictment, while two of his friends and
two of his enemies fell under the ban of
the Grand Jury, is giving the editor pres
tige as a tall and lofty tumbler.

inary. He would have none of It, how
ever, and swore he would have his ene

to have ; broken* up his family relations.

Under no circumstances can any candi
date take a trading delegation to the. Re
publican State Convention from this
county without the consent of Mr. Met
calf.
The question that 13 now agitation Ala
meda County Is whether Mr. Metcalf
wants that delegation for himself for

But the action of the Congressional
Committee in declaring for one delega
tion makes the Congressman master of
the situation, and he can now take what

dates to come to him. *
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
111S Broadway, June 27.
The Republican Congressional Commit
tee of the Third Congressional District
decided to-day that there should be but
cne set of del ates to both the State
and Congressional conventions and that
tbe delegates that were elected to nomi
nate a Congressman from this district
should also sit in the State convention
and assist in selecting the general offi
cers ot the State. This means that don*
Sressma.n Victor H. Metcalf will take an
interest In more than his own nomination
f pr Congress, and that he will have a de
cided anchor to windward in case any
thing happens in the State convention of
which he may decide to take advantage.
It means thatwhoeyer desires any favors
at the hands of'the delegation from this
county must first consult with Victor H.
Metcalf, who is thus made the party
leader on this side of the bay.
â¢ The. nomination of Mr. Metcalf for Con
gress was absolutely assured and there
has been a belief growing that the* Con
gressman might even carry the county
against all comers for any other office.
There has been much talk within his own
county that he might enter the lists for
Governor, but until the action of the Con
gressional Committee there has never
been any Indication that the Congress
man looked beyond his seat In the na
tional legislature. Now the politicians
are wondering if the Congressman has
t'ecided . to look for State honors. His
friends in Oakland say "no." and tha
Congressman is in Washington maintain
ing a judicious silence.
The Gage men in Alameda County are
anxious to see Mr. Metcalf succeed In
Congress. They are making an Alameda
County campaign for him for- a member
of the Cabinet, so anxious are they that
Mr. Metcalf should remain in Washing
ton.
The Pardee men have already declared
against a delegation from this county
that would nominate both a Congressman
s'.nd a Governor, for that would force
Pardee to go to Metcalf. The touching
anxiety of the Pardee men to see Met
calf succeed In his ambitions In Wash
ington is equaled only by that of the
Gage men.

"About ten months ago a baby boy
came to our house. I was, of course,
er.xlous; to have good nourishment for
him and eo drank from five to eight cups
of Postum during the day. This with a
little Grape-Nuts Food each day wa^ all
the nourishment I took, and although the
baby weighed only five pounds at birth
he weighed twelve and one-half pounds
;it three months and at four months fif-
teen pounds. Now he weighs twenty-
three pounds.
"About three weeks ago the little fellow
ruddenly weaned himself, much to our
surprise. I tried him on cow's milk, but
he would not have it. I then tried a cer-
tain baby food, then another, but he
would have neither. I felt very anxious
about him, but remembering experiment-
lug vith another boy with Postum I gave
him some, which he drank with the great-
est rellEh. It agreed with him perfectly,
to he lived on it for one week. Since
then he has learned to eat a little* other
food, but he prefers Postum Coffee to
anything else, and looks perfectly de-
lighted when hÂ© sees me coming with it.
I rsaid the other morning, 'I wish the
Pobtum Company could see baby drink
their coffee; it would certainly please
them.' It agrees with him so perfectly
that I shall continue to have .him drink
it to his heart's content I don't like to
have my name printed, but you can say
1 em a Cong. Pastor's wife." Name and
address Riven by Postum Co., J>itle
Creek, Mich.
"When one of our children was a year
old be would not drink milk, so we tried
him on Postum Coffee, and from the first
he llkfd !t and it agrreed with him per-
fectly, so Postum has. been his drink now
lor over four years.
"The old headaches and nervousness
have disappeared and we both enjoy very
much better health.
The wife of a Congregational minister
gives an experience: "It is rather curi-
ous, the manner in "which I came to adopt
Po-stum for my baby. My husband userl
to te troubled greatly with bilious head-
aches and extreme nervousness. This was
about fivo years ago. We concluded that
coffee and tea were the cause of his
troubles and ho gave Postum Food Coffee
a triel. At first we did not like it because
It was not boiled long enough and seemed
weak and tasteless, but after preparing
H properly, ar.d that is easy, we became
very fond of it, and now can honestly say
we prefer it to any coffee or tea.
A coffee that will nourish and furnish
all the food required to rear a baby is

his wif*Â» rnadf his life miserable by ac
cusing him of displaying a fondness for
other women. Mrs. Salmond rested but
i: few 'days under the imputations in the
i-aptafn's complaint and then flied counter
charges, in which f^he accused Salmond
of paying too much attention to femaiÂ»
passengers on his steamer and of treat
ing her cruelly in various other ways.
She asked that the captain's prayer lor
a divorce be denied and that: she be
granted a decree.
BITTER- FEELING MANIFEST.

certainly the benefited parties by the stand
taken by the oil producers. Each well-owner
seems to solicit the position of being the cheap
est vender of his -product. It Is not who can get
a. fair price for his output, but who will suc

Failures for the week number 200 in thÂ«
United States, against 204 last year, and 20
in Canada .against 23 a year ago.
Agricultural prospects are far above the av
erage, and rapid progress is made with winter
wheat harvesting. Delays have been .encoun
tered from heavy rain, while Injury has oc
curred Southwest from drouth, but these ad
verse influences are less extensive than usual
Wide differences between cash prices and next
crop options indicate the' views of traders. The
week brought little alteration Jn spot quota
tions, light supplies holding, cereals fairly
steady, Â¦ .
Leather has accumulated, and some tan
neries are closed, but belting belts continue la
demand at full prices. Raw wool is in better
request at Eastern markets, b.ut the new clip
is held at a premium that limits trade.
Eastern manufacturers of footwear report a
larger volume of contracts, mainly for deliv
ery in August and September.
Most of the blast furnaces that were stopped
by the scarcity of anthracite coal have re
sumed with Â«oke, of which the ovens have es
tablished new records of output and shipments
have been etill larger, owing to the stocks ac
cumulated during the car shortage.'
Foreign markets were badly disarranged by
the sudden illness of the King and there was
much liquidation prior to the closing ot ttii
British exchanges from Wednesday afternoon
to Monday. Domestic financial conditions ara
exceptionally satisfactory and trade 'is well
maintained, although low temperatures inter
fered with the distribution of midsummer spe
cialties. Manufacturing operations have In
creased In activity, especially, in the iron and
steel industry, and textile production, while
the constructive work on new buildings and
bridges Is very heavy. Labor difficulties have
not improved in the anthracite regrion, but
numerous settlements have : been effected else
where. Railway earnings thus far reported fpr
June exhibit an ' average increase ot 4.0 per
cent over last year and 1.7 over 1900.

: CHICAGO, June 27.â Oats ctood in the lime
light to-day. From a small business this pit
developed a general trade that was of marked
Interest all over the floor. All the strength of
a genuine Â° nature seemingly sfree from manip
ulation developed. The situation was brought
about by a sLrontr cash demand. Â¦ Statisticians
report stocks being rapidly depleted and not a
car of new oats came to-day. Crop reports are
very bullish. With . No. 'â¢ 8 white selling cash
to-day at 53<S5.1%c and delivery day only two
days off., shorts Â¦ -covered sharply. Outsiders
bought in a healthy manner. July, new, open
ed %Â®%e up at 44Â«&@44%ic. Jumped to 47c.
but on profit taking and a break in other mar
kets lost a good deal of. it3 advance. July
closed strong l&SlVie up at 45%@45%c. Sep
tember eold to 33%c -on the upturn,- dipped to
32%c. but closed firm.%@V4c up at 33"Vlc .
Wheat W 3S topheavy on manipulation and
broke after very good early strength. At the
outtet the wet weather over mucn of the har
vest country and grasshoppers in tbe Northwest
brought good buying. Corn bulls bought liber
ally of September and set the crowd to guess
ing over the outcome. Corn was firmer and to
gether with oats gave wheat strength. When
it was seen that corn could not hold its -own
price the crowd turned bearish in spite of ad
vices that were bullish. Stuff was sold freely
and weakness ensued. July, which '"opened un
changed to i/Â»c up. at ?3%@73%c, sold to
73%c, fell off lc and closed Vt,c down at 73c.
September- sold as high as 72%@72%c. dropped
to T2c and closed a shade lower at 72%c.
This was another big day in corn. Boosted
by thÂ« fears of shorts and on wet, cold weath
er reports, July shot up to 69%c, a fresh
record here. The undertone most cf the day
was slrong. but the fluctuations were erratic.
In September the buying was of such a vol
ume as to create interest. The talk of the pit
centers around the / supposed leadership .of
John W. Gates as the bull in July and John
Cudahy as the big short. Renewed seeing l>y
Cudahy In September after he was supposed to
he tljp victim of Gates madÂ« the crowd be
lieve that there was a private understanding
between them. Closing prices were Just firm,
July lie up at 68%c and .September %c higher
at ei^Gl^c.
. Provisions ruled dull and unimportant to
day. Hogs were weaker and influenced fair
Belling. Prices accordingly were weak. Sep
tember pork was 10c lower, lard 5@7%c down
and ribs 5c lower.
The leading -futures ranged as follows:
The pressure has risen over the northern half
of the Pacific Elope and fallen along the coast
of California. A depression of great depth
extends along tie Mexican boundary from
Yuma to El Paso.

Eggs rule weak at the decline already noted.
Most dealers quote 18c as the top for the best
ranch. Receipts are more moderate again, but
there are too many Eggs on the market, never
theless, and dealers continue to put their sur
plus into store. Â¦ There are some Eastern sec
onds on . the market at the quotations below.
Receipts were 59,210 pounds, 253 cubes and
22 kegs of Butter, Â¦ lbs of Eastern Butter,
985 cases of Eggs, cases of Eastern Eggs.
12,900 . pounds of California Cheese and
pounds of Oregon Cheese.
There is nothing new in Cheese.
The demand for cheap Butter continues, as
the bakers are the best buyers of late. The
fi ner_-creameries are quiet, as the exodus of
puofie from the city into the country Is said
to be greater than ever before. During: the
past two or three days there has been gen
eral complaint of the unusual dullness in trade.
Prices show no further decline, however.

In cereals the . features have ' been the
strength of corn, on reports of cold weather,
and the advance in oats, due to short supplies
and large cash demand/. Wheat has fluctuated
in narrow . limits, but the large decreases in
supply have ' constituted a balance 'to the quite
favorable reports as to the winter and spring
planted orops. . At this, the usually dullest
period of the year. -the movement .of general
merchandise is still very large. The coal
strike dulls trade at the. leading Eastern mar
kets. A lull in the demand for lumber at re
tail is noted at New- York. Philadelphia and
other cities, but the mills are Arm as to prices.
Builders' hardware sales - are ahead of last
year. Copper and tin are very, much weaker.
Wheat, including flour, exports for the week
aggregate 3,382,701 bushels, against .3,860.434

ground appears ; to have been lost, but on tho
contrary distinct gains over the best of pre
vious years have been Â¦ noted In many | lines:
Profits may have been but the vol
ume of trade turned over has about made up
for this. Export trade in agricultural prod
ucts is one of the few .lines to suffer in com
parison with the previous years.' Unseasonably
coal weather :is a drawback to Immediate retail
distribution and arrests the progress at the
corn crop East and WestL Confidence in the
outlook, however, is evidenced by the continued
heavy buying for fall delivery noted in the
great grain growing sections of the West. This
is also reflected by a continued large increase
in every earning over the best results of pre
vious -years, except where, as in the case of
the coal roads, distribution is paralyzed by the
wholesale shutdown of production and -con
sumption. Aside from this single exception,
however; the general industrial situation has
rather improved. The price movement has
been irregular. In keeping with varying weather
conditions, as far as agricultural products are
concerned. Cotton moved, higher on continued

rains at the close of the week in Southern

The Potato market showed ILttJe change. Of
ferings -of choice stock were limited and sold
readily, but the market was glutted with poor
stock, which splij slowly at unsteady prices.
Onions were offering freely and prices showed
little variation. .
All descriptions of Vegetables were In free
supply and the market was fairly active. String
and Wax Beans did better under a steady in
quiry for shipping. Tomatoes held up well. A
tew large boxes came in from the river and
sold at $2 25 ver box. Offerings of Green Corn
were large and the market was easy on poor
stock. About 30 crates came . in from Ala
nieda, the first of the season from that quar
ter, and sold at '$2 50 per crate. Cucumbers,
continued to weaken under heavy supplies.

Pending Proofs.
At the request of Ho Tow. Imperial
Chinese Consul General at this pert. Min
ister Wu Ting Fang at Washington has
prevailed upon the Secretary of the Treas
ury to order Customs Collector StrattoÂ»
to hold certain Jadestono tablets and seals
taken from the baggage of United States
military officers returning from China.
Ho Yow appears to attach aa much Im
portance . to the tablets as though they
were the orlgnala on which the Ten Com
mandments -were written on Mount Sinai.
A translation shows that thÂ» Inscriptions
are merely the stereotyped Oriental
eulogy on a departed gentleman of the up
per class. Ho Yow says that he thinks
they are Government property looted by
foreign soldiers during the Invasion and
capture of Peking-.
Collector Stratton received a dispatch
yesterday from the Secretary of tha
Treasury instructing him to hold the
tablets and seals for "thirty days only,"
so that tho ChinesÂ© authorities may have
an opportunity of proving that the prop-f i
erty belongs to their Government. V

grounds that the court had no jurisdic

to sue and that he did not state facts suf

to the parade committee. $195 for print

for three bands which are to play during

was accordingly done.
The recommendation met with the ap
proval of the general committee, and
Walter Gallagher, who at the meeting
before had made the motion that no
money â¢ be paid to non-union musicians,
moved that this action be rescinded. It
RESCIND RECOMMENDATION.
At a previous meeting of the commit
tee it was decided not to pay the Na
tional Guard bands for their services.
This decision was reversed yesterday ami
now both the union and non-union band3
will be given the same compensation.
When the decision of the Musicians' Un
ion was made known a joint meeting of
the music and finance committees was
held and it was determined to recom
mend to the general committee that the
military bands should be paid for their
services.
The matters which were in dispute be
tween the Fourth of July committee and
the Musicians' Protective Union have
been satisfactorily adjusted and the way
paved for a successful celebration on In
dependence day. E.-W. 'Kent of the Mu
sicians', Union announced at the meeting
of the committee % yesterday afternoon
that the board of directors of the union
had decided to permit the union bands to
play in the parade' with the non-union
National / Guard bands, provided the
guardsmen march at the head of the or
ganizations to which they belong. This
announcement was a source of joy to the
cGir.mittee, as it completely removed the
question of dispute which had threatened
to prevent a street parade. '
Detective Graham located the man as
he was working in a field yesterday and
demanded his surrender. At first he de
nied his identity, but when he saw the
detective was determined to take him
into custody he. seized a hoe and. made a
desperate attempt to fight his way to lib
erty. The struggle lasted some time,
when Guiglizza was clubbed into submis
sion and taken to the Central police sta
tion.
Spinetti and the police heard from the
alleged thief about one year ago. He de
serted from the army at. Varese. . Italy,
and had been recaptured and pressed
back into service. With the assistance of
the Italian police it was ascertained that
the man wanted had been mustered out
one month ago and that he was on his
way to San. Francisco.
Guiglizza and an aged man named
Gerolomo Cordana worked together until
March 2, 1900, on a vegetable ranch.- Just
previous to their separation Guiglizza dis
covered that his fellow workman had
$750 on deposit in an Italian bank. In
forming the old man that he would pur
chase property for him, Guiglizza, it is
alleged, secured possesion of -the money
and on the same day left for Italy. Judge
J. A. Splnetti took cliarge of the prosecu
tion for Cordana and caused a warrant
charging felony embezzlement to be is
sued at that time.
Giovanni Guiglizza . was arrested last
evening . at a ' vegetable ranch near the
Five-Mile House after a desperate fight,
in which he tried to beat Detective Gra
ham, tho arresting officer, with a hoe.
Guiglizza, it' is alleged, committed a
theft two years ago and was tracked to
Italy, where he remained/ until he rer
turned to this city three days ago. Those
who claimed he robbed them awaited his
return, "then invoked the aid of the law..
Katherine C. Felton, general secretary
of the Associated Charities, to whom the
case of Miss Hacker was referred, wrote
to the girl's father on the same day, re
questing him to forward money sufficient
to purchase a ticket for Los Angeles for
his daughter. The money was sent with
out delay and Miss Hacker returned to
her home on Wednesday evening, consid
erably wiser by reason of her experience.
Meanwhile Mackey Is being looked for by
the police, and If he is located he' may
be arrested for abduction.
I got acquainted with some nice people and
they . have taken good care of me. Well. I
will close, and you must write as soon as you
get this. Your daughter, MAT.
Well, we finally got here, and then came
the worst of all. Last night he said he had a
nice room, and when I went to go to it he
commenced taking his collar off. and there I
was. waiting for him to go all the time. He
said he was going to stay there, too, but I told
him if he was going to stay there I was
going. He said ho would give me 15 minutes
to make up my mind to stay or I would rue
the day. 1 didn't care, I told him. My mind
was made up, and with that I left the room
and went across the street to the Winchester
House and trot a room there, and in the morn
ing I reported him. And now I am going
ever to Oakland to etay at a place the Asso
ciated Charities have until they hear from you,
and then they are going to send me home.
FLEES FROM BOOM.
When Mackey was looked for -at 25
Third street he could not be i"ound. It
was stated that he had changed his lodg
ings and that he could be found at 826&
Market street. Mrs. Prescott went to
that address and left a note for Mackey,
directing him to turn Miss Hacker's bag
gage over to her care. The baggage
showed up on the following day, but
Mackey, who evidently feared arrest,
could not be found. Miss Hacker spent a
few days in the Chabot home in Oak
land, and while there she sent thu follow
ing communication to her father:
SAN FRANCISCO, June 20, 1902.-
Dear Papa: I guess you will be more than
surprised to hear of me being here, but never
theless I am. I will tell you the whole busi
ness. Mr. Mackey came out to see me and
said that he was going to Catalina and wanted
to know If I didn't want to go down for a day.
Well, of course, I thought that was all right,
and so I went, as I thought, to Catalina. After
Â¦ I had been on the water for about an hour and
a half I asked him how far It was to Cata
lina and he said he didn't know. And- 1
thought it was funny we didn't get in sight
of any place. So finally the purser and cap
tain came around to take the tickets, and I
beard him say "Frisco," and then he read
the number. And I asked him what that
meant and he said we were passengers to San
Francisco, and I started to cry./ And, -then
Mackey said I ought to be glad to have such
a trip, but I couldn't see it that way.
MACKEY IS MISSING.
. Mackey accompanied the girl to a thea
ter the same evening and returned to their
lodgings shortly before midnight. His
actions while in the room with her fright
ened Miss Hacker, who made a dash for
liberty and ran into the Winchester
House, where she told her story to the
.night clerk. Suitable accommodations
were provided for the hapless girl, and
on the following day her case was ex
plained to Mrs. Prescott of the Children's
Protective Association.
Mackey left the girl on the arrival of
the steamer, saying he would return with
a ticket to Los Angeles and see to tne re
shipment of her baggage. He then pro
ceeded to a lodging-house at . 25 Third
street, where he rented a room for him
self and wife. On .his return to the
steamer he Informed Miss Hacker that he
was unable to raise money for her return
ticket until Monday, but that he had se
cured her a room in a respectable lodg
ing-house, where she might pass the in
terim in perfect safety. The unsuspect
ing girl accompanied Mackey to the
house indicated, it being understood by
the landlady that the couple were hus
band and wife.
The couple started presumably for Cat
alina on Wednesday of last week. , An
hour after the departure of the steamer
Miss Hacker asked Mackey how far Cata
lina was, and he replied that he did not
know. Then she made the discovery that
the steamer was bound for this city.. She
became frightened, whereupon Mackey
informed her that if she created a scene
on board the ship she would uselessly
compromise not only him but herself as
well. Filled with shame, the unhappy
girl sought seclusion in her berth, never
leaving it unti\ this port was reached.
Two weeks ago Miss Hacker resolved
to spend a short vacation with friends at
Long Beach. Mackey suggested that he
take her to Catalina for a day's outing
in return for her kindness to his wife
during her fatal illness. v She agreed to
the proposal, it being understood that
after leaving Catalina Mackay was to ac
company the girl to her friends at Long
Beach. ' . , ~ . Â¦
GIBIi BECOMES FRIGHTENED.
The enticement of Miss Hacker from
her home narrowly borders upon abduc
tion. She had confidence in Mackey,
whose .wife she knew well prior to Mrs.
Mackey's death, about six -weeks ago.
Mackey is a man of middle age and was
employed with the Santa Fe Company at
San Bernardino. Miss Hacker is the
daughter of R. H. Hacker, keeper of the
city park at San Bernardino. Some
months ago she workea at Rialto as an
orange packer, and while In this employ
ment she met and became engaged to
"William Williamson. At the time of Mrs.
Mackey's death the Hackers took charge
of the funeral and did all in their power
to render the lot of the apparently al
most inconsolable widower comfortable.
Miss May Hacker, a pretty girl' of 18
years, living at San Bernardino, was en
ticed to this city under peculiar circum
stances last week by B. H. Mackey, a
widower, and but for the timely interfer
ence of Mrs. Prescott ofÂ« the Children's
Protective Association she might now- be
anoth-er ; victim to the wiles of that class
of unscrupulous" men whose chief aim In
life appears to be to lure attractive girls
to their ruin. ' t

II /pLUONS Â«se CUTICURA SOAP, assisted by CUTICURA ;
I VI OINTMENT, for preserving, purifying, and beautifying
'*"'** the skin, for cleansing the scalp of crusts, scales, and dand-
ruff, and the stopping of falling hair, for softening, whiten-
ing, and soothing red, rough, and sore hands, for baby rashes,
hchings, and dialings, in the form of baths for annoying irrita-
tions and inflammations, or too free or offensive perspiration, in
the form of washes for ulccrativc weaknesses, and - for many '
antiseptic purposes, which readily suggest themselves to women W.
and especially mothers, and for all the purposes of the toilet, bath,
and nursery.* CUTICURA SOAP combines delicate emollient
properties derived from CUnCURA ODVl JVUiNT, the great skin
cure, with the purest of cleansing ingredients and the most
refreshing of flower odours. No other medicated soup ever com-
pounded is to be compared with it for preserving, purifying, and \
beautifying the skin, scalp, hair, and hands. No other foreign
or domestic toilet soap, however expensive, is to be compared with
it for all the purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery. Thus it
combines in ONE SOAP at ONE PRICE, the BEST skin and
complexion soap, the BEST toilet and 'BEST baby soap in the
world. yv '
