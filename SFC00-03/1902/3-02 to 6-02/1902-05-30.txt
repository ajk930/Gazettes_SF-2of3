an iron cross, twenty feet high,

were soaked by the heavy rains

Representative McClellan of New York

every year entails the cruel and indecent
starvation to death on the Islands of

\V., WASHINGTON. May 29.â It was
learned to-day that the condition of At

It was feared his illness would take a turn
which would result fatally, or at least
permanently Impair his constitution.
When the violent change In tlrejveather
came Tuesday. Attorney General Knox,
who was taking a drive in light clothing:,
got thoroughly chilled, and the result
was the congestion of almost bis entire
system. A serious illness* came on that
night, but by the application of hot
baths and other remedies the trouble was
kept in check until a doctor was sum
moned yesterday morning. Surgeon Gen
eral Rlxey of the United States Navy at
tended Knox, and found that he was not
only threatened with pneumonia, but also
with acute Bright's disease. This latter
was of so serious a phase as to cause
the greatest anxiety. The home treatment
to which Knox Â¦was subjected was <the
very best thing that could be done. The
doctor found the patient in a much im
proved condition to-day. He thinks aU
danger is passed. Knox, however, will
be compelled to keep to his bed during
the rest of the week.

Is as follows: , : - â¢ . ., Â¦Â» â¢ . Â¦
"That the Secretary of . the '". Treasury is

After several selections, instrumental

a short address in introduction of Ad
miral Glass. The Admiral said in part:
The watchword of the navy Is ready for duty.!
We sailors would much rather do things than
talk about them. Never turn back. You, the
class of '02, are just commencing: a new chap
ter In your book of lire, and In so doing there
â¢Â¦â¢no grander or nobler theme than that of
the sailor â all lives for our country and ever
in readiness for duty. You owe duty to your
country, duty to those about you and duty to
yourselves. Always do right. You have fin
ished your school life here at the academy,
and may you look back with great satisfaction
at what you have accomplished.
But It is only the beginning, and you should
start to-day to study. for life's training if you
wish to attain a higher type of manhood. We
sailors have had to do much of it. Without
such study and training we would not have
been able to do what we have for pur country.
Courage and comprehension in nature are birth
rights of every man. but these require training
and study. We might be called upon to go
to the assistance of others, but in so doing,
although we might not be publicly lauded, yet
such acts are the upbuilding of self-respect
.and the holding of you in high esteem by thoae
about you. United effort with the soldier, the
preacher and tha school teacher; though wide
apart. Is a great asslstanca in life, and when
combined with loyalty there is union. Without
loyalty there Is no union. ' And so I say, ba
helpful to others. The well-being of your
country lies in the discharge of your duty.
Scholarships were then awarded to the
following cadets by Dr. Crosby:* First
scholarship to John E. Cushing of ' San
Rafael: second scholarship to Walter M.

SACRAMENTO, May 29.â There is small
hope of an early settlement of the trou
bles between the Contractors' Association
and the Building Trades Council. Yester
day's meetings of the conference commit
tee were not productive of anything as
suring an amicable adjustment of existing
differences, but point rather to further
delay. From what can be learned, the
representatives of the council on the com
mittee made a concession to the emplqy
ers, but It does not appear that th% grant
ing of this concession marks the way to
settlement. It is understood that the
council's representatives agree to submit
certain propositions from the Contractors*
Association to the individual unions for
approval, pending which the resolution

and of Martinique are of the besfclass\of
negroes, 'many of them having been edu
cated in the schools of Paris. The whites
are in numerous instances descended from
old French legitimist families. The people
are very sharply divided into "bosses"
and laboring men, and the bosses make
up a social circle entirely their own. So
sharp Is the line of cleavage that the only
club for Europeans at St. Pierre was
â¢known ..simply as the "White Club."
The negroes' had a club called
the "Black Club." One of - the
old French' families, that of the
Perlnnelles, had a palatial estate in the
suburbs of St. Pierre, this being probably
the most notable private estate in the
West Indies. ' .
The "bosses" of St. Pierre were in near
ly every instance engaged in the manu
facture of rum, sugar or cocoa. The rum
factories are the most Important, the ar
ticle being manufactured from the sugar
cane, which iff raised in great abundance
in the plantations of the neighborhood.
The most Important of the rum factories
belonged to M. de Garagarrl,' M. Savon
and M. Berti. The Berti plant consisted
of some five distinct distilleries/valued at
about $500,000. The extensive sugar plant
belonging to Dr. Guerln, ' and valued at
about $200,000, was destroyed by the vol
cano. Â¦ ' Â¦ . . :
The seat of the government of the island
is at Fort, de France. St." Pierre, how
ever, was the chief commercial city, ofthe
island. The municipality was governed
by, a Mayor and council of twenty-seven
members. Â¥ The Mayor ' was M. . Hyacinthe
Nicole,- with tRene â¢ Clavius-Marius and
Amedee Knight as deputies. The munici
pal government was -housed in one of the
many fine, buildings of the city.
The topography of St. Pierre was pecu
liar. Facing the sea, with no land protec
tion whatever from tides, its harbor was
not a^ safe refuge for ships in time of
storm. The beach was so abrupt, never
theless,', that -heavy., draft steamships
lound it possible to go within fifteen or
tweny yards of the shore, there transfer
ring their cargoes to barges and lighters;
which could steam up and down the mile
or so of beach directly; bounding the city.
The buildings began- within a few yards
cf ;hlgh tide point, and^covered the "land,
inspite.of a very abrupt slope,- for near
ly a mile inland. -^ The River Blanche is
about a mile and ,a half above, the upper
boundary of : the city. This is the most
important. 1 stream of the. neighborhood,
but- it. Is not navigable. ....
'^Distinctive I among the' buildings of the
clty:,was< a. Catholic cathedral, \ presided
over by -Mgr. Marie Charles, Alfred -de
Cormont:, This was a. magnificent -struc
ture for such a small. city, and was- built
many "years , ago.' In the diocese of St
Pierre * there â¢ wore ."Â¦: three ..' churches - and
Several â¢ small chapels. 1 In addition there
was a. Jesuit college of no insignificant
proportions, Â¦Â¦- there being, about thirty-five
.professors in the. faculty. â¢ â¢, /;Â¦Â¦>â¢â¢Â¦.,.
The business of 'the city, "outside of the
export. ;trade,- was" done, through â¢Â¦ retail
stores. ' There"' were . twelve v. dry * goods
stores, 'Â¦- two ' large -hardware Â« stores,-, mak
ing a -specialty- of farming- materials,- and

four brokers. The money of the city was
iargely. handled by the Banque de la Mar
tinique, founded in 1S51j with a capital of
3,000,000 francs. In addition, there, were
in St. Pierre agencies of the Bank of
France. and the- Colonial Bank of London.
The city, maintained a complete public
school system. There was a fine hotel,
known as: the Pierre Crbcquet, where
many persons went on visits from France
to enjoy the climate of the island. â¢ Just
outside the city v there was an -elaborate
botanical garden, where . a superb collec
tion of tropical plants had been gathered.
One. of the features" of this garden, and
one which illustrates the eccentric to
pography of the country, was a water
fall, dropping some 300 feet.
Â¦ There were no railroads or street cars
in or near the city. The island Is too
mountainous to allow of the building of
railroads: For that reason the only means
of reaching the interior was over \ the
great highways. There were only a very
few "of these, owing to the extreme diffi
culty of building them.
After the short eruption of Pelee in 1851
the fumes and fires sank back -in the
earth, and in the heart of the cone a
small -lake formed.
So confident were the people that there
was no danger lurking within that mound
that they" built a large recreaation resort
at Morne Rouge, a beautiful place high
up. on the . ridge connecting Pelee with
Carbet, on the south, and on the road
from, the city/ to the crater, about \ four
miles, from either. Toward this resort
and toward^ the crest of .the hill itself
ran the only roads leading from the city.
Morne Rouge was a place where a large
number.- of the people of Â¦ Martinique
sought rest in the hot summer months.
The population of the place in the height
of the season was several thousand. /At
this period of the year It was generally
inhabited by 700 or 800 persons. ....-Â¦

fS - a sor A. C. Lawson, head of the
Bfâ^f geology department of . the
Ef ' gV University of California and
iS Mf an acknowledged authority on
â¢* geological subjects among the
scientists of the country,
made statements to-day relative to the
present disastrous eruptions of Mont Pe
lee, which throw new light upon the prob
able causes of the cataclysm and which
portend a dismal outlook for the distress
ed island of Martinique. According to his
statements, the present outburst may con
tinue for an indefinite time and will prob
ably result in making the whole island an
uninhabitable volcanic waste. . ;
"ITrom what I can gather from the^tel
egraphic reports, and from the statements
of the daring \ scientist. Professor Hill,"
said Professor Lawson, "the present erup
tion has only been equaled in history by
that of Mount Krakatoa in Sumatra in
1883, and its effects will ultimately be
more widespread than in the former case.
I agree with the present scientific opinion
that the explosive eruptions will probably
be more and more violent and it is very
reasonable to believe that the lava flow,
which has only commenced within the last
few days, will eventually cover the whole
island of Martinique.
; "In the casef of Mont Pelee, the erup
tion is the result of the inrush' of the sea
into the molten interior, of the mountain
through some recently established v sub
terranean fissure. This engenders the tre
mendous steam pressure which is "suffi
cient to' produce the powerful explosions
noted in the dispatches. . ;
"The eruption of La Soufriere on St.
Vincent and the earthquake disturbances
in Guatemala are all correlated with the
eruption of Mont Pelee, since they are all
traceable to the same underlying cause,
the breaking of that part of .the earth's
crust under strain and the inrush. of the
sea into the fissure, thus established: Un
til a gradual readjustment of the earth at
that point takes place, these disturbances
will continue unabated." . . . - -

The Cuban Sugar Question.
This morning's London newspapers are
all alike in tone, and all are of the opin
ion that the war is over. The Daily Tel
egraph saye:
"Mr. Balfour's statement in the House
of Commons, carefully as it was guarded,
ran have no other meaning than that the
war is virtually over, though peace may
not be yet established."
The Daily News remarks:
"It seems the Vereeniging conference
bas decided in favor of peace. The fu
ture of South Africa will not depend on
Um 'â¢-.Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦'j- of englishmen to prove their
COMMENT/ OF PRESS.
Operators on the stock exchange, as a
rule, preferred waiting for a definite
statement before buying. Baifour*s prom
ise was interpreted farorably. in Thrbg
niorton street. South African, mining
shares were nibbled at, but the state of
indecision was not materially altered by
the closing: hour. Shrewd men are tak
ing their profits where they can, the feel
ing among many of them being pessimis
tic.
"I hope to be able to state to the House
on Monday the result of the recent dis
cussions in South Africa, but I cannot be
absolutely certain of being in position to
do that and until that (statement can be
made. I think it would be inexpedient to
take up the budget. There being a shad
ow of doubt as to whether I shall be able
to make a final statement on Monday, I
think it would be inexpedient now to an
nounce that we will take up the budget
on that day." i
The conviction that the announcement
of peace is now only a question of hours,
or a few days at the very most, was
strengthened by the words of Mr. Bal
four in the House of Commons/when re
plying to Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.
iSaltour said:
TAKING NO CHANCES.
A member of the Government yesterday,
in reply to a question as to why peace was
not announced, if it was held to be at
tained, indicated that the notorious as
tuteness of the Boers which had often
brought about unexpected turns made one
hesitate to say anytnlng before everything
â¢was settled beyond the hope of change or
alteration. Had it not been for that there
would ha.ve been little . hesitation about
making a. i-peciric statement.
"We are able," continues the Mail, "to
affirm that peace is regarded as settled In
oincial circles. We understand that the
Ministers themselves, wnlie unwilling to
aumit it officially, regard it so privately."
U. \V. Lucy, tne veteran parliamentary
correspondent of the Dally News, one of
the most reliable and best posted men at
St. Stephens, Intimates that peace may be
proclaimed to-day, the King's birthday,
irom the steps or the Mansion House.
" in otner wyrus, it will agree among other
things to a. general surrender, Â¦ carrying
v, j m it tne loss or indepenaence. Certain
minor details, none ot wmen should af
reet the main question, remain to be set
tled, it was this communication which
the Cabinet was hurriedly caned to con
siuer yesterday, wnen tne deliberations
lasted an hour. Ail the Ministers were
present.
It is possible, but hardly thought prob
able, that a semi-official statement will be
made to-day. From information received
in London last night the Boer delegates
whv returned to Vereeniging from Preto
ria, yesterday met representatives of the
commandoes and exercised their influence
for the acceptance of the British terms,
with the result that they practically
agreed to accept peace. Certain minor de
tails only remain to be settled, and they
are not expected to affect the broad decis
ion arrived at.
The Daily Mail says it is able to state

forth at length arguments In- Its favor. It
is essentially the same as the covenant
prepared by the special committee of

There was an exchange of rights to the head,
neither \ boxer, however," sustaining any dam
age.' Britt ' looked confident, while Lavigne's
face commenced to wear a haggard look. Britt
landed a left on the head and followed it with
a right and left to the face. Lavigne missed a
terrific right swing, the swish of his glove be
ing heard throughout the pavilion. Toward
the end of the round Lavigne seemed dazed,
but Britt was not able to take advantage of
his condition. . ' - .
at once assumed his crouching position, which
he never abandoned throughout the fight. La
vigne was the first to lead, trying a left, which
fell short. - There was a quick exchange, which
Britt ended with a right to the head. Lavigne
sent his left to the head twice, Britt . came
back with a right' to the head and Lavigne
missed a right swing. Britt came back with

face. He followed this by missing a left.
Lavigne tried a right swing but missed. Britt
came back With a hard right to the head. This
was plainly Britt's round. He showed good de
fense,' and was as quick as a cat on his feet,
but was not gauging his blows well. .
FIGHT BY ROUNDS.
First round â There was considerable' feinting
when,- the gong sent the men together. Britt
After the fight Lavigne : complained '"of
his left forearm, a bone- in which he
broke some- time since. He went at once
to the office of Dr. Leonard. Â¦ When the
tape bandage was removed from the arm
the member fell limp by the boxer's side;
Dr. Leonard found the large bone broken
near the old fracture and the small bones
broken In two places. It is apparently a
bad fracture. . Lavigne said he thought
it happened early in the fight. He swung
his left, which met a right swins of
Britt's. He took his ' defeat much to
heart, although he said he would rather
lose to Britt, of whom he Is a great ad
mirer, than to any one else. . -
The prate receipts were slightly In eic
ces of $5000- Of this Britt receives $1823 50
and Lavigne $624 50. Britt will gt> at once
to Harbin Springs, where he will spend a
couple of weeks louhgirg about. He has
agreed to fight George Â¦ McFadden here
late in June. . . :
Britt secured a lead in the first round
which he never relinquished. After the
light he said he could have won more
quickly, but his seconds-held him back.
He came out of the contest without a
mark. He has a style peculiarly his own,
which is most effective. He still has the
crouching attitude, but relieves himself
by- straightening up from time to time.
He has abandoned the rigid style so ap

San Francisco Wins Out After a Hard
Fought Game.
LOS ANGELES, May 291â San Francisco
won out in the eleventh inning to-day after
a game that was interesting principally
because the score was tied from the sixth

but fielded 'the position in phenomenal
style. Whalen pitched good ball through
out, and was particularly effective at
critical stages.

OAKLAND.
The customary ending happened at Re
creation grounds yesterdayâ Oakland had
the weighty end of an 8 to 3 finish. Young
Thomas delivered the twisters for Sacra
mento, while Schmidt was there for Oak
land. Thomas was not as effective as
usual, but, barring one inning, pitched tho
real article of ball. Schmidt had the Sen
ators corraled in the tall timbers and
but for three costly mlsplays would have
shut them out.
Oakland put the big kibosh on Fisher
in the fifth, when they slapped little Willie
around the lot for five bumps, and. aided
by errors the Senators were generous
enough to make, scored five, points./ A
couple of hits and a clever double steal
by Schmidt and JDunleavy put three more
to the good in the eighth, ending the run
getting.
Costly errors by Mohler and Lohman
sent two Sacramento, recruits over the
jumps In the fifth and Dunleavy's mult
of Hulen's fly and a single finished them
up for the day. *
The game started off in brilliant fashion,
but eventually cooled down. Oakland
made three hits In the opening round, but
pretty. fielding kept them from approach
ing the rubber. Francks robbed Hulen
and Eagan of safe hits by marvelous work
in the same inning and played a mag
nificent game throughout.
Cutter, the Santa Clara boy, played in
right for Fisher. He will do a pitching
stunt in this morning's game at Recrea
tion Park, while, old Mike Steffani will
officiate in the afternoon". The morning
game will be called at 10:30- o'clock and
the afternoon contest at 2:30. The score:

fair from the start. | Saulsbury was the
"stronger, but his opponent developed a
disagreeable left punch to the body which

up and out of the ring without much de

.The mail will leave Dawson City on
June 15 for all points on the Yukon and
Koyukuk rivers. The last clerk will leave
on the St. Paul on June 3 and go to St.
Michael, there to commence duty on the
river steamers.
There will be a postal clerk on every
steamer operated by the Northern Com
mercial Company during the summer, and
instructions have been sent to the chief
clerks at St. Michael and Eagle to swear
in any purser who may he running on any
steamer' that is not included in the sched
ule. At all points postal clerks are au
thorized to deliver mail to responsible
persons , wherever boats may stop. , Â¦
with hl3 left and sent a glancing right to the
head. Britt was clearly the best in this round,
Lavigne already looking beaten.
LAST CLEEK TO GO IN.
WILL BEAT STEAMERS. â¢
This at most will take only six days,
so that mail will arrive at the mouth of
the river several days before ocean
steamers arrive there starting from Seat
tle on the same date.
. The effect -of these arranzements will
be the abandoning " of St. Michael in
forwarding mail to Yukon River points,
but mail for St. Michael and Nome will
be sent in by steamer from Seattle as
heretofore. Mr. Thrall has let contracts
for carrying mail to Frank Waterhouse &
Co., .the Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany, the Pacific Packing and Navigation
Company and the Northwestern Commer
cial-Company, all of which operate steam
ers between Seattle and the mouth of the
Yukon. In 1900 four clerks were detached
to make the round trip from Seattle to
Dawson, and in 1901 six clerks made, the
round trip. This year fourteen clerks will
make three trips each between Dawson
and St. Michael, being forty-two trips
in all, and will stay till the close of the
season, about October 1.'
Two of the postal clerks have gone in
overland,' nine- of the clerks went up on
the Dora on May 20, and Â¦ two ' clerks will
go in overland, via Skagway and Daw
son,- with shipments of 50u0 pounds of ac
cumulated winter's mail, which is due to
leave Seattle on May 30.
From four to six weeks is to be saved
in the future In the carrying of malls to
Yukon River points. Instead of sending
accumulated mall -via St. Michael, the
Postoflice Department will ship it to Daw
son through Skagway and over the White
Pass Railroad. . -
This plan was originated and has been
successfully carried through to a work-
Ing basis by H: P. Thrall, superintendent
of.- railway mail service. By 'this method
all points dn the Yukon River will be sup
plied before July 1,. commencing with a
supply, from Eagle about June 17. which
win- mean a difference of at least four
weeks, \and should - the ice be later, in
breaking. ,: up: than usual the difference
wllr.be- greater. â¢ '
Mr. Thrall lately returned from SeattH.
where -he has completed arrangements
for the dispatching of the mails with the
White Pass and Yukon Railway and with
the Northern Commercial Company. This
company has lately finished building a
new steamer on Lake La. Barge, named
the Koyrukuk, which, on its arrival from
White Horse at Dawson, will carry part
of the acumulated mail and rush it up
to the* Koyukuk River and, down to Bet
ties, which is fast becoming a point, of
prominence, while the Yukon River mail
will be : placed on another steamer.

Colonel Wagner Praises
Philippine Concen
tration Camps.
Says People Were Well Fed
and Provided For by the
Army. *
WASHINGTON, May 23.â The Commit
tee on the Philippines to-day heard the
testimony of Colonel A. L. Wagner, as
sistant adjutant of the general a^y, who
two and a half years in the fau
ippines. He was questioned about the
concentration camps ana described the
system by explaining the details of one
particular camp. In that camp the peo
ple in all cases would have their old
neighbors near them. So far as he had
been able to observe there was no evi
dence of want among the people there
congregated,- Moreover, they were . sur-
Drisingiy contented. They were at liberty
tolo omride the line from 300 to 800 .yards
Beyond that distance was w 1 1 Â» t 4 1 J a> 5f'Jf,S
the dead line, beyond which the people
were "not permitted to go The natives
were given to understand that if they
crossed this line they would be shot, but
in reality the orders were not to shoot
any helpless persons or any others II tne
shooting could be avoided.
Colonel Wagner said that one of tne
principal purposes of concentrating the
natives in the Philippines was to protect
them against the ladrones, which had
been admirably accomplished, so that in
many cases what was called the dead HnÂ«
was in reality the life line.
PEOPLE WEBE WELL FED.
Another object of the camps had been
that of facilitating the collection or the
rice supplies in order to starve out the
ladrones and guerrillas. The result had
been that hostile parties had practically
disappeared, and their leader, Malvar, had
been captured. The army had been much
like a blind giant. It wa3 strong enough
to cope with the enemy, but was not
able to see where the danger was. The
policy had been necessary to protect life
and property, and he did not see how any
other policy could have been successful.
Replying to Senator Beveridge, the wit
ness said the people were well fed and
given medical supplies, and the sanita
tion of their camps was looked after. The
American camps in the Philippines no
more could be compared to Weyler'a re
concentration camps In Cuba than mercy
could be compared to cruelty.
A number of questions were asked by
Senator Culberson concerning General
Bell's policy in comparison with that of
his . predecessor. General Sumner.
"General Sumner," said the witness,
"was not allowed to take as severe meas
ures as he deemed necessary, because he
told me that hi was handicapped by his
instructions from department headquar
ters."
POLICY WAS JUSTIFIED.
Continuing, Wagner said that neither
Sumner nor Bell had been responsible, for
the policy pursued, as each was subject
to the orders of department commanders.
"If Sumner had remained in command,"
he said, "he would have been required to
carry out the same policy as Bell did."
He supposed, he said, that the orders
had originated with General Chaffee, but
he did not understand that the orders
were written. The policy had been Justi
fied by the fact that all the people con
gregated had now returned to their homes
and on the 4th of July the provinces of
Batangas and Laguna were to be restored*
to civil rule.
Referring to. the, policy of burning vil
lages, the witness said that indiscriminate
burning was not countenanced . by. the
rules of war, and that the practice of
burning the property of non-combatants
was inexcusable except in cases in which
it was impossible to separate it from that
of hostiles, and in cases when the enemy
was making use of it.
CLOSING DEBATE ON BILL.
Senators Still Show Great Interest in.
the Philippines.
.WASHINGTON, May 29.â Interest In the
Philippine debate is increasing as the dis
cussion draws to a close. To-day "tha
Senate galleries were thronged with au
ditors and the attendance on the floor
was larger than it has been for some
time, including many members of the
House of Representatives. Lodge cf Mas
sachusetts, in charge of the bill, offered
on behalf of the committee several amend
ments to the measure, the most important
one being extending to "the Philippines
the provision of the bill of rights of the
constitution of the United States except
ing only the right to bear arms and the
right to trial by jury. All of the amend
ments were agreed to.
Morgan of Alabama delivered an ex
tended speech In which he supported in
the main the bill as presented by the com
mittee. He said it looked toward peace
and toward a just and peaceful govern

: II vigne in . Woodward's .Pavilion, last
I night in the eighth round of one
Qj/ of the most desperate fights ever
seen here. Â¦
Â¦ Lavigne was not knocked out. For the
second time in the same ring the brother
Instinct in Billy Lavigne asserted Itself
and he' jumped through the ropes and
spared the "Kid" the humiliation of be
ing knocked out and also saved him from
unnecessary punishment.'
Britt proved his master last night and
it was the consensus of opinion among
the spectators that it wilt be difficult to
find a, man who will bar the young Cali
forhiari*s way to the lightweight boxing
championship of the world. A marvelous
change has been wrought in Britt since
he fought Hegarty. His defense was im
pregnable and with but few exceptions his
blows went true to the mark. He never
lost >his head for- a moment and was al
ways ready to ' go . at any pace his op
ponent might set.
The marvel of the fight was the amount
of punishment La vigne took and came
back fighting. It was not the Lavigne
of old who fought last night. There were
flashes of the old lighting spirit and the
old aggressiveness, but the power to pun
ish had- vanished with the years. La
vigne is only thirty-two, but the buffet
ing he has encountered in fighting his
way to the lightweight championship has
left Its mark. His muscles stood out In
bold relief last night and there was a'

Supreme Court Frustrates Attempt to
Officially Schedule Length
of Man's Life.
James Burns, who was convicted of an
attempt to commit robbery and sentenced
to nineteen years'lmprlsonment, is likely
to escape- all punishment for his crime
as a result of a decision of the Supreme
Court rendered yesterday. 'The court's
opinion also annuls a section of the Penal
Code which treats of life imprisonments.
Burns pleaded guilty to several prior
convictions. Under the law, had he really,
commlted the crime,' It would have been
the duty of the trial . Judge to sentence
him to life imprisonment. The Penal Code
provides that the sentence for an at
tempt to commit a felony shall be half
that prescribed for the commision of. the
act. The trial Judge therefore found him
self compelled to give a one-half life sen
tence to Burns. After various mortuary
tables of insurance companies - had been
consulted, the prisoner ;was j officially
scheduled to live thirty-eight years and
sentenced accordingly to spend nineteen
years In the penitentiary.
The Supreme Court' says, "Death is cer
tain, but life is very uncertain." and holds
that the Judge's approximations have no
legal value- The. law in question is said
to be "clothed in the garb" of a Chinese
puzzle." . Without 1 consideration of the
other points of 'the appeal, the judgment
of the lower court is reversed and a new
trial is ordered. â¢ >., \ Â¦Â¦Â¦'.-

A FINISH fight between the Sacra
mento River A r alley: producers
and the commission merchants of
San Francisco has been declared.
and the conflict Is scheduled to
open on Monday morning next. Both
sides are well prepared for the fray, and
belore the smoke of battle clears away
it is probable that the prices of produce
will come down on the run. Most of the
prominent growers of the Sacramento
district have organized -to protect their
rights, and their backing Is said to be
wonderfully strong In all parts of the
State. A half dozen of the larger produce
associations in California have declared
their friendship and support in behalf of
the growers. The commission merchants
of San Francisco have a strong organiza
tion, which has hitherto withstood all
attacks. In consequence a .battle .royal
may be expected.
The growers' new organization is called
"The Sacramento River Co-operators,'
although its membership Is in no way
lccaliz-ed. It is stated that producers in
general throughout the State have for
many years been practically at the mercy
cf the local commission men. It is al
leged also that the agriculturists have
been continually deceived as to the prices
which they should receive for their prod
ucts. They, say, too, that they have too
often not been allowed a just proportion
of receipts for sales. When they have
applied for redress they state that they
have been given no satisfaction. In con
sequence feeling among the producers
has become strong, and it has finally
been determined to make a mighty effort
to secure what they claim to be their
rights. A store has already been estab
lished at 503 Front street and fruit and
vegetables in large quantities are on
hand.
MEET MANY DIFFICULTIES.
The "Co-operators" were incorporated
at Sacramento on April 9, of the current
year. An attempt was shortly afterward
made to commence business in San Fran
cisco Independent of thp commission mer
chants.- l Application - was made ! to the
Produce Protective Association to be ad
mitted to membership. On last Tuesday
this petition was denied by a vote of 23
to 10. An effort by the salesman of the
growers' organization to conduct business
on the Clay-street wharf failed by reason
of the effect of a rule of the Commission
Merchants' Association, which says: "No
member of this association shall sell any
potatoes or onions from any wharf, boat,
car or railroad station in the city and
county of San Francisco to any one who
JUDGE'S GIFTS DO NOT .
INCLUDE OMNISCIENCE
Is not a member thereof, except for re
snipment outside of the city and county
of San Francisco." . â¢ â¢, -" Â¦
The reason for this quasi boycott, It is
alleged by representatives of the grow
ers. Is that the new organization proposes
to divide its profits with the farmers in
just proportions. ThÂ« "Co-operators,"
hewever, being incorporated, are like any
other business firm, although the mem
bership is not limited.
It Is alleged that if the growers are
allowed to conduct business they will
materially decrease retail prices and pay
the producers better.
OFFICERS ARE SELECTED.
The directors of the "Sacramento River
Co-operators" are: A. T. J. Reynolds,
president; P. H. Gardiner, vice president;
W. H. Nichols, secretary; T. W. Dean,
treasurer, and L. AV. Myers, J. L. Aldrich
and J. Herringer. Other heavy producers
in the district who belong to the organ
ization are G. A. Smith, Charles Studa
rus, C. H. Davis, L. D. Greene, C. E.
Hansen, E. H. Myers, W. A. Kesnes,' C.
W. Jor.es, Mrs. D. D. Gammon and Cut
ter Brothers
. A. R. Sprague, general manager of the
California Fresh tfYuit Exchange, state3
that his associates are 1 with the growers
heart and soul.
1-resldent Reynolds says, that he and
his fellow organizers have assurances of
sympathy and support from all quarters.
He states that the members already num
ber thirty-nine of the more prominent
producers in the Sacramento River dis
trict, and that applications for opportuni
ties to ship produce to the company's
local sales house are very numerous. He
says that dissatisfaction with the San
Francisco commission merchants is wide
spread and has existed for many years.
BEGIN BUSINESS MONDAY.
Ben C. Dalton has been chosen for local
sale&man. He will commence to do busi
ness with retailers and the general public
next Monday morning. Produce will be
sold as advantageously as possible, but
sold nevertheless. It is presumed that
the commission merchants will adopt re
taliatory measures, but the growers state
that they have no 'fear but that, they will
win in the end.
It is expected that the growers In gen
eraj, realizing the advantages of dealing
with the "Co-operators," will cease to
conduct business with the commission
merchants and thus cripple them. The
producers are firm In the belief that thev
can continue the- struggle indefinitely.
Ihey will sell In any quantity desired to
any one who has the money to buy. The
name of their local house will be "The
Growers' Co-operative Agency."

Against the Prisoner Was Direct
and Conclusive.
Judge Declares That the Evidence
CHICAGO, May 29.â A verdict of not
guilty In the case of William McFelridge.
accused of murdering his brother, brought
a reprimand to the jury from Judge Ka
vanagh to-day.
"I cannot understand how you ever ar
rived at such a conclusion," said - tin'
court. "If ever a man â¢was guilty. McFel
ridge was that man. The evidence was
direct and conclusive. I would not have
been surprised if you had Imposed the
death penalty."
William McFelridge and his brother,
Robert, had quarreled for years. Follow
ing a suit in a Justice Court last fall,
which had gone against William, the lat
ter met his brother carrying a little girl.
After a few words William McFelridge
opened fire and continued to fire as his
brother ran away. The latter died after
reaching home.
McFelridge attracted attention at th-?
trial by taking up his own defense and
continuing it five days. At the end of
that time he accepted the aid of an at
torney. He pleaded that his shots were
fired in self-defense. H said that Robert
had often threatened to kill him and that
he was justified in taking no chances.
Severai witnesses, however, testified that
Robert was unarmed and made absolutely
no move of a threatening nature against
William.
Soeclal Dispatch to The Call.,
TUCSON, Ariz., May 29.â El Correo tie
Sonora, a paper published at Guaymas,
Mexico, says that there is Imminent dan
ger of another Yaqui outbreak. Bands of
Indians have already visited a number of
settlements during the past week, killing
and robbing ranchers.
At La Carmen, a hacienda near Hermo
sillo, on Tuesday, ten Yaquis attacked the
place and killed the foreman and a cow
boy, besides taking away with them some
of the stock. Another band made its ap
rea ranee the same day at a ranch near
Bato Matal, where they destroyed the
property of Dona Juana Mayeoren, a
ranch woman, well known In Sonora. A
number of other settlements were visited,
end close to Guaymas the Indians were
seen.
The Guaymas paper says that it is not
known whether the Indians have all
taken to the warpath, but the situation is
serious and troops have been ordered out
to hunt down the Indians. The Mexican
Government has been trying to corral ail
the Yaquis and move them to an interior
State in the southern portion of the re
public Efforts in this direction have been
very successful, but some of the more
dangerous Yaquis are known to be out in
the mountains and ready to resist the
Government.
At some ranches this week stock has
Tseen found which was killed by Indians
In the raids made. La Carmen is near
Hermoslllo and the poldness of the In
dians is taken as meaning that they have
reinforcements ready to take up a fight
with the Mexicans. It was known '<n
Guaymas that the Yaquis are harassing
the settlers.
A sort of guerrilla warfare has been
kept up by the Yaquis for several years
and many of the most prominent ranch
ers in Sonora have met death at their
hands. Americans traveling in Sonora
have not been molested and mining man
si gers there report that they have never
bad troubles with the Indians. The griev
ance of the Yaquis is with the Mexicans
aiid it seems that terror has spread to the
haciendas- where the Yaquis have been
during the week.

CLEANLY WOMAN
Erroneously Thinks by Scouring Her
Scalp That She Cures Dandruff.
Cleanly woman has an erroneous idea
that by scouring the scalp, which removes
the dandruff scales, she is curing the
i dandruff. She may wash her scalp every
day, "and yet ; have dandruff her life long,
accompanied by falling: hair. too. The
only way in Ihe world to cure dandruff
is to kill the dandruff germ, and there
is no hair preparation that will do that
but Newbro's Herpicide. Herbicide, kill-
ing: the dandruff germ, leaves the hair
, free to grow as healthy Nature intended.
Destroy the cause, you remove the ef-
fect. Kill the dandruff germ with Her-
picide.

here /Governor. Gage is a distinct loser. Mac

County. He had been recently elevated by the
Chief .Executive to an important State position,
and he was- depended upon to hold his county
in lino for the Governor. He has demonstrated
that he cannot do this and it follows that the
prospects cf Gage in that county are hopeless

CHICO RECORD (DEM.) :

of tire most important victories for pure politics
in recent years in this State. , For years Santa

The Democratic press and newspapers that are non-partisan in tone comment freely on the gubernatorial
campaign. Here are some views of the San Jose election: . "
Democratic party, . has been hoping that Gov
ernor Gage might be renomlnated. as he would
probably be the easiest man In that party to
beat. But after all Mayor Schmita may do
almost as well. Schmltz happened to do just
the right thing during the carmen's strike a
few weeks ago, and now he is being hailed as
a great man by those Republicans who cannot
agree upon any other leader. But SchmiU is
not a jtreat man.
SACEAMENTO BEE (IND.):
Indirectly, the results of the San Jose elec
tion indicate that Gage is not likely to have
a very strong support from Santa Clara County
in the coming Republican State Convention,
which will . nominate' a fun State ticket. His
appalntxnent of Mackenzie was evidently made
in the hope and expectation that the boss could
and. would procure a solid Gage delegation from
Santa Clara County. To obtain this advantage
the Governor was willing to put a notoriously
unfit man in a position of great trust and re
sponsibility. . At the time of the appointment
of Mackenzie the Bee republished the San Jose
Mercury's scathing review of the record of the
boss, and anything of a more blistering char
acter has perhaps never been written of a Cali
fornia politician. . - '
FETALTJMA COUKIER (DEM.)*:
If the Gage "business administration"
should be guilty of a few more blunders of

lost the sum of f 1G.637 2Â»â lost it as abso

Whatever may be the cause of the resignation, the
retirement of the successful chief of state is a heavy
loss to. France. His Ministry has been the most for
tunate in the history of -the republic, and the good
fortune which attended it was due mainly to the
tact, the patience, the sagacity and the genuine
patriotism of the Premier. When he took office the
people of France fvere so-torn' with factions, the
Deputies were divided with such bitter antagonisms
and there was such a general feeling of unrest,' it was
believed his Ministry would not last six months He
soon proved himself to be exactly the right man for
the place and for the time. He strengthened his hold
upon his friends and conciliated opponents] He held
office longer than any other Premier since, the es
tablishment of the republic. He' now retires, leav
ing his party a good working majority in the Cham

France if it be true that he is not to retire utterly

..Had the Ministry been'beaten in the elections the
prompt retirement of the Ministers before the Cham
bej of Deputies assembled to vote them out of office
would not have been surprising, but the retirement
of a successful statesman immediately after receiving
the indorsement of his country is something quite
different. The situation is the more strange because
as yet no sufficient explanation of the resignation has
been given. A recent. report from Paris was to the
effect that the retiring Minister cherishes ambitions
to become President, and has come* to. the conclu
sion that it will be well for. him to get out of party
politics while he can do so with credit and honor.
The report comes from no authoritative source, but
it shows what the Parisians think of the situation
and how unsatisfactory arc all the reasons which
have -been publicly given by M. Waldeck-Rousseau
for his action. . u'?~C
DESPITE the handsome support given to him
by the French people, M. Waldeck-Rousseau
has carried out his announced resolution to

go out with him, and now France has to face the
crisis of a complete reconstruction of- tfte Govern

vote in the history of the city. The newly
elected Mayor, George D. Worswlck. two
months ago was comparatively unknown, but
his straightforward pledges to conduct the city
government upon a business basis won him tha
suffrage of the. majority. The defeat of Mac
kenzie and his cohorts indicates tha loss of
Santa Clara County to Gage In the Republican
convention. Mackenzie was so sore that h*
could deliver the Santa Clara delegation that

A CRISIS FOR FRANCE.
There are a few- Republican Journals of re
spectable standing that have not attacked Gage
and that ever, venture to rebuke those papers
that are making such a fierce onslaught upon
him. -These do not assume to defend Gage's
record, but merely put it upon | the ground
of policy. Their reasoning is that if, perchance.
Gage should, through the manipulations of the
bosses, walk away with the nomination, the
party would have a hard time In overcoming
the record as set forth by the leading Repub
lican ; Journals. On the whole, the situation
ia interesting to a Democratic onlooker. The
Democratic press is pleasantly relieved of the
duty of showing up .the faults of Gage's ad
ministration, and can await the outcome with
complacency. The Democratic party, how
ever, must not bank too ' much upon any real
or apparent discord in the Republican ranks.
The fact should be kept in mind that the Re
publican party has so long been accustomed to
taking and . obeying orders in important elec
tions that when tho time for coaxing and whip
ping Into line comes, that oft-repeated opera
tion may be at least partially successful. - The
time Is auspicious for the Democracy of the
State., provided the' councils cf the party are
guided by wisdom. The very best and strong
est men should be selected for the Stats ticket,
and the mistake of averconfldence should bs
carefully avoided. Organization thorough and
complete should be . the rule and Â¦ a united
Democracy the watchword;

Since the Kaiser is to send us a statue of Freder
ick the Great by way of showing his affection for our
republican institutions, it might be well for King
Edward to cap the gift by presenting us with a
statue oi George III as an evidence of royal' for
giveness. .
' The position of chief of Tammany seems to be a
queer one. When Nixon had the office he found he
was not "in it," while Croker, who got out of the of
fice, seems to be in it and to fill it so full that it
can't work without him. .
Probably no man has ever been as much misrep
resented to the public as he. But he never showed
resentment and was too busy in the interest of his
friend and his principles to defend himself. When
be entered the Senate his talents for public life, not
impaired by disuse but rather strengthened by lying
dormant, were asserted, and he has enjoyed the re
spect and confidence of the strong men in the Senate
cf all parties. Being a man of large wealth, won by
enterprise, it was charged that heÂ»was hard and un
tympathetic toward labor. But when labor required
some common tribunal that would be able and will
ing to give the time needed for the adjustment of
its troubles and the betterment of its condition he
was its first choice as head of the Civic Federation,
where he serves with such men as Bishop Potter
Archbishop Ireland and former President Cleveland.
So, outliving detraction and jealousy, he stands in
some important resptcts the foremost man in the
country, and his party in Ohio, does itself credit by
unanimous indorsement of him.
His position has been won without the sacrifice of
bis own views or independence. No act of dema
gogy can be charged to him. He does not hesitate
to oppose capital or labor when he thinks either is
wrong, nor to support Either against the other when
he believes it to be right. The Republican party of
the country may, well. be content with the leadership
of such a chairman of its national committee "and
snch a representative of its principles and policy.
The victory of 1896 was. mainly due to Mr. Hanna's
knowledge of men and his keen comprehension of
his countrymen. He had been a wage-worker. He
had experienced the hardships of all conditions of
life. He had but to remember his own career to feel
the pinch in the fortunes of others. He had an in
tense humanity, and was not under bonds to any
partial or prejudiced view of things. With all this
he had an unfailing optimism and a keen sympathy
that has kept him as gentle-hearted as a woman.
His success was so full that his enemies found no
other cause than corruption to which to attribute it.
Mr. Bryan very weakly assumed that Chairman
Hanna had' corrupted the republic. Such a transac
tion would have implied an ability ascribed to no per
sonality since Milton drew his picture of "Lucifer,
son of the morning." To accomplish a purpose so
vastly malicious would have required a genius, albeit
for evil, that the world had not yet known. It may
be said, with reason, that the genius had appeared,
but that it wrought its purpose with clean hands.
Long before' he had achieved financial success and
position he was a close friend of McKinley. To ad
vance that friend's fortunes he first took an interest
in politics, and from the iiour that he first appeared
in that field he devoted himself unselfishly to the
task of making^IcKinley President. His success is
history, but there is no other history of such an
achievement that records equal service of a man to
his friend and his country, made beautiful by as com
plete self-effacement.
No public man in recent years has faced a higher
storm of detraction from the party in opposition nor
a more .-stinging jealousy in his own party than he.
It is the sacrifice exacted from success. He began
life at the foot of the ladder. . Naturally possessing
talents that z professional training would have pol
ished into brilliancy, they were, kept in hand by the
self-restraint of his Quaker blood and made subor
dinate to the practical necessities of his condition.
He had to plod, to toil patiently and go forward step
by step.
Let it not be thought that in this there was any
looking forward to his possible candidacy for the
Presidency. The only issue personal to him was his
re-election to succeed himself, in the Senate. As far
as the will and wish of a party can be shown in a
State convention they were ' expressed in favor, of
<uch succession. As for the Presidency, there is no
feeling anywhere adverse to the candidacy of Presi
dent Roosevelt, provided that he, as the architect of
his own fortunes and future, shall choose to have it
so. But if he shall not so choose, the Republican
party has no lack- of Presidential material, and no
doubt Senator Hanna will be found among it.
{T is in recent political history that the Republi
cans of Ohio were divided in sentiment concern
ing Senator Hanna. In the State convention that
has just been held in Cleveland the. Republican party
of Ohio was represented by its best elements, and
Senator Hanna was supported with a unanimity un
known for many years in that State.

FRESNO ! REPUBLICAN :
;The general attitude of .the people and precs
cf tho StatÂ«1 toward the : San Jose : election Is
significant of a change that is rapidly coming
over the minds ' of the people. The ticket that
was defeated in San Jose was the regular Re
publican ticket. I Whether Mr. .Worswlck, who
was elected Mayor, Is a Republican or a Demo
crat, nobody outside of San Josfj seems to know,
and nobody anywhere* cares. '', The opposition
to the . Republican ticket .was led Jiy^ the two
Republican newspapers, of San Jose, and the
rejoicing over the, defeat of the Republican
ticket is general among; the Republican. papers
and Republican people of the State. And no
body seems to find this' fact queer. It. is taken
quite for granted that- a Republican paper, or
a 'Republican leader can, without the slightest
Inconsistency, oppose a Republican candidate
and advocate a Democratic or anti-Republican
canal date.
This is as it should be. The machinery cf
tho national parties is convenient to use. in
getting nominations made simply because It has
a permanent existence, while it is difficult and
not always desirable to create a local organi
zation which must be made anew out of noth
ing for each election. Moreover,- it is well' to
have some organization in which people have a
pride or interest profit by the .success or -suffer
by tho failure' of local officers. But, otherwise,
nobody need care a particle whether a city is
governed by Republicans or Democrats. .Tire
fact tityt there Is - an increasing number of
people "Â¦ who > do not . care ia one of the most
promising signs of the times.
POMONA TIMES:
Rev. L. P. Crawford of Pasadena, over SO

No boss has any great 'power only as the
people by apathy allow him to get hold of first
one office and then another. He is a cease
less, tireless worker, who burrows under the
surface and works while good men sleep. He
trades and traffics in secret. He gets hold
of first one officer and then another, while the
people, not dreaming of what is going on, vote
his candidates Into . office and- thus- .weld one
link after' another, of the. chain which binds
them to ' his chariot wheel. He promises an
office here, patronage there, stands in with
schemes to blackmail or extort money out of
rich men and con>orations, leads young, men
Into political Jobbery and holds them to him
through fear that .they will be exposed or will
lose 'their positions unless they stand up 'for

the infamy, of his schemes and understand the
methods -by- which he secures control and they
rise Â¦ in their might and hurl the boss from

SAN BERNARDINO SUN:
A special dispatch from San Jose says:' .
After the 'hardest and in some respects the
most bitter municipal campaign ever known in
San Jose, the : Citizens 1 , or reform ticket, has
won a' sweeping. victory. The result Is a com
plete overthrow of the political powers that
have existed here for years, and the defeat of
Johrnie Mackenzie. and. the' local "machine.".
The result is* significant, ; in that it has been
conceded throughout the campaign that should
the Mackenzie machine jvtn it would mean the
indorsement of Gage, while,- if defeated, it
would mean that anti-Gage sentiment has pre
vailed. This has been talked freely during
the contest, and has not been denied by tho
machine forces, but they rather courted the
idea. Â¦ . â¢ â¢ : Â¦ . .
v At this distance the full significance of the
result of San Jose's municipal election may
not be recognized, but it can safely be set
down as the most important development in
the gubernatorial campaign that has yet come
to the surface, for it was by agreement that
the / champions of Governor Gage, and those
who are against him, -joined: In battle, and tho
former were admittedly and undeniably routed.
I Santa Clara County has been disputed terri
tory ever . since the fact developed that Gov
ernor Gage was to be stoutly opposed for re
nomination. In the progress of the executive s
campaign, and for the purpose of casting an
anchor to windward, he not long ago looked
about for an appointee on the Board of Harr
bor Commissioners, at San Francisco, one of
the most important political appointments that
he had to make, because of the- large amount
of patronage controlled 'by the board. It will
hardly be denied that the Governor is shrewd
enough to select men for such places who will
mo*t , advantage hlms?lf politically, and af
ter looking: over the State, hÂ« concluded that
his. fences -needed repairing quite as badly in
San Jose as any place else, and he selected
Johnny Mackenzie, an influential and promi
nent Republican of the boes type, and supposed
to be in control of the- San Jose machine.
'That laid the foundation for the municipal
campaign that was decided Monday. The is
sue was strictly non-political so far as party
lines : were concerned. , The question that was
passed up to the voters of San Jose was t6
elect Mackenzie's ticket and Indorse Gage,, or
defeat it and repudiate the Governor. And
Mackenzie's candidate for Mayor will continue
as a private citizen.
MODESTO HERALD: ' ;â¢ .
Governor Gage was repudiated by the people
of San Jose when on Monday they defeated the
municipal ticket put 'up by ' his henchman,
"Johnny" Mackenzie, on which was based a.
trial of strength between the State administra
tion and all citizens' opposed to bossism in poli
tics.- Only two months ' ago Gage appointed
Mackenzie as member of the" Harbor Com
mission for no other reason than that he be
lieved Mackenzie could deliver the Santa Clara
County delegation to the State convention to
him. The defeat of Mackenzie puts the last
nail In the political coffin of the Governor,
and Mackenzie also goes under. E. A. Hayes
was ; the | leader of the opposing forces. He
will be remembered as a campaign speaker
who stunwed this county twice.
NELES HERALD:
- Gage's home friends admit that they are de
pending uaon San Francisco to carry him to
victory. If they succeed no better there than
in San 'Jose and will at home, we see his
glory going a-glimmering. May it be ever so.

It is -the duty of every citizen to cast a bal

gratitude to the country and a woeful lack

too strongly, but if the people as a whole per

General Wood was -quite right .in '.'Â¦ treating the
clamor as a matter for jesting. The whole thing Js
ridiculous. Here are a set of would-be statesmen,
on the eve of a general election at which their party
will ask the suffrages of the people, ignoring every
great issue before the country and going about seek
ing campaign ammunition in the scandals and
rumors of irresponsible babblers. Even should such
ammunition be found it would,avail nothing. The
American people are not going to ; be stampeded in
this campaign by an assault with' stinkpots. \
In' the face of that failure Richardson has been
more careful about hunting frauds, but other Demo
crats have rushed forward to the chase. Of late we
have heard much ; about the scandal, they are going
to bring, to light in connection with General Wood's
administration in Cuba, but as yet no facts have been
revealed which in any slightest degree justify the as
sertions of the scandal hunters. General Wood v him
self has met the issue by saying: "All expenditures
in Cuba are', matters of public record. No money has
been expended except .on competent and. proper au
thority." .Concerning the splutter made by .some of
the scandal mongers over v certain' expenditures- for
champagne and whisky, the ; General said : "The ? arf
tides were ordered for. public entertainments, as it is
not; usual to provide sand and lumber for. such pur
poses." * â¢ ' ' . Â¦ , â¢
With all his dragnet investigation Richardson ob
tained nothing except a clear' refutation of every
charge that had been made Tjy the free and ready liar
who started the sensation. Instead of developing a
sensation he developed a farce.
When the adventurer, Christmas, sprung his story
of fraud and bribery in connection with the proposed
purchase of the Danish West Indian islands Mr.
Richardson, the Democratic leader in the House,
snapped at the chance of unearthing a scandal, not
withstanding every intelligent man perceived that the
story was absurd on the face of it. . . }
Not a" single great issue has been raised by the
Democrats of the House or of the Senate. 7 They
have offered nothing in the' way of a policy as an
alternative to the Republican measures affecting our
relations to Cuba or the Philippines, the settlement
of the currency problems, the restriction' of immigra-r
tion, Chinese exclusion, or the' reorganization of the
army. Instead of .dealing ; with great policies, the
Democratic leaders have been busily engaged .trying
to find some petty fraud here and there,, jusf as if
the American people would overthrow the adminis
tration if it could be shown that one or two rascals
had managed to get into office and had embezzled
all the money they could lay their hands on.
The efforts made in Massachusetts and in New
York to restore harmony^ to the divided, party have,
been futile, but when compared with what has been
done at Washington to frame new issues they have
been dignified and respectable. It is doubtful if "ever
before in political history, did a set of party leaders
charged with the task of raising issues against an
administration make such. a poor and ' even con
temptible showing. .'.;Â¦ N â¢: . "
WHEN the present session, of. Congress be
gan the leaders of the reorganization move
ment in. the Democratic .camp had -great
hopes. They expected to bring the gold men and
the silver men to act. together and to furnish the re
organized party with new issues' to- fight for. The
task of harmonizing the factions was undertaken by
leaders in New York, Boston and Chicago; that,. of
bringing forth new issues was intrusted to Demo
cratic members, of Congress. The session is now
about to close. The Congressional campaign before
the people is at hand. In fact, in some States it has
virtually begunâ but where ;are the new issues?' \
HUNTING FOR ISSUES.
STH AGE'S support from the press of the State is growing smaller by degrees and beautifully less. The victory
I Z~oi the good government forces in the San Jose battle is everywhere accepted as a rebuke to Governor
V J| Gage and his discredited followers. For three months prior to the election Gage was plummy himselt on
the prospect of a triumph for the push- in. Santa Clara County. The result of the contest was a staggenns:
blow to the adminstration henchmen, and 'sent Gage reeling southward to gather v up some support in his home
. county: Vv Â¦:'Â¦?> v r >% â¢ -
In asserting that one term of Gage is enough the newspapers 'simply reflect the sentiment of the people in
every county of the State. The advocates of another, term of Gasre. Kevane and Aguirre cannot be found outside
the ranks of-the State officeholders and . their deputies. There has been a deal of public criticism concerning the
- unfitness of men recommended by Burns and Herrin for appointment to responsible positions, and much of the criti
cism is justified, but 'the fact is obvious that the worst appointments made by the administration were those select
ed by Gage himself, from his own coterie of intimate associates. The Call to--day presents another collection of ex
cerpts from the leading newspapers of California: v .
People- of California Will Not Stand for Another Four Years of
Â¦; Gageâ Kevane and Aguirre, Governor's Personal Appointees,
Turn Out Worse Than Those Named by Direction of Bosses
tlfy himself with about all that is objection
ablo in political life, and because his recog
nized agents were arrayed against the forces
of rtform in San Jose, the victory over v boss
rule was in effect an anti-Gase victory.
A principal is responsible for the acts of his
agents; therefore Governor Gage cannot escape
responsibility for the acts of those exponents
and exemplars of gang politics who have mail i
war against the people and the people's inter
ests at San Jose and elsewhere.
John O. Lynch, Walter S. Moore. Jere Burke
(a San Francisco Democrat of the "push"
breed), and other representatives of Gage and
tho gang, to the number, it is said, of nearly
100 were sent down from San Francisco to help
defeat the people's reform ticket in San Jose.
ThÂ«y spent their money (or somebody's money)
and their time freely, but in vain, as the result
shows. They lost not only the election, but
their election bets, which are said to have been
large in the aggregate. The citizens had be
come Â¦ thoroughly aroused and were determined
not to be Sodomized any longer.
It was a square, up-and-up fight between
the forces of boss rule, or "push" politic*
(which is, unfortunately, another name for
Gage politics) and the forces of reform- and
political decency, as represented by the Re
publican Good Government League, headed by
E. A. Hayes and.- his brother of the San Jew
Mercury and Etening Herald, and strongly
backed up by James W. Rea. To the latter.
In particular, great credit should be given for
' having come out manfully in support of the
people's reform ticket â when he finally becam*
convinced of the corrupt practices of the gang
â and for having made a strong fight In ttÂ»Â«
interests of the people. *' Â¦
There can be no possible chanc* to belittls
the results. The election ia of Importance, -not
merely as regards its immediate and local ef
fects, but - as indicating the trend of public
sentiment. There is a strong popular ten
dency in all parti of the State to repudiate
and resent boss rule. The San JosÂ« election
is merely one among many indications of this
revolt on the part of the people against rinÂ»
politics. It is a most wholesome sign, bat It
augurs ill for the gubernatorial candidacy of
Henry T. Gage. It shows with the certainty,
almost, of a mathematical demonstration, that
he cannot be re-elected Governor of California.
Representing as he does the wont features of
<Jnach!r.e politics, he will be repudiated by thÂ«
people â should the "machine" force his nomi
nation â as surety as Boss Mackenzie was re
pudiated by the people of San Jose.
The lesson is plain. Unless the Republicans
of California court defeat in the coming Stats
election, they will at all hazards defeat the
efforts of Gage's henchmen to place him In
nomination for a second term.

SAN DIEGO TRIBTJ2TE:
â The announcement that San Diego County
will send no Gaga delegates to the State nomi
nating convention, as made In the Tribune ' to
day, is not a surprise to the people of this
end of the State, but it Is convincing evidence
to the State at large of the strong sentiment
in San Diego County against the renomi.iatlon
of the man who as Governor has abused the
power placed In his hands by the people.
Gage's record has been such that even his
own supporters have withdrawn from him, and
in thi3 county the hopelessness of making a
contest is ao evident that no effort will be made
In his behalf. His act in vetoing the Normal
School appropriation cannot be forgotten here,
and. other features of his maladministration
have ' created such a general dislike that he
could! hope for only repudiation at the polls
' If his nomination should be forced in the State
convention. .-....-
The exposure of the questionable "business
methods" in vogue Th the Cage administration,
made by The San Francisco Call last week.
seems to have found a generous approval by the
press all over the State. Truly such business
methods as that .of pay ins: a premium Of nearly
$17,000 for something which could be bought at
par within two months are not surprising as
used by .Gage, but they do not commend them
selves to thinking citizens. By the act of the
Board of Examiners In purchasing the Kern
County bonds the State school land fund lost
Just $10,637â a loss as inexcusable as it is se
rious. â¢ . â¢Â¦â¢â¢:%â¢ â¢
Governor Gasre himself is a member of the
board . which made this brilliant "business'
deal. As Governor, after this remarkable bit of
financiering had been executed, he vetoed a bill
Y.-hich had passed both houses of the Legisla
ture for the purpose of preventing a repetition
of just such' foolishness.
It is probable- that the discovery and ex
pocrate of the' startling facts connected with
that bond deal made by The Call had much to
do with causing the defeat of the Gage machine
in the election just held at San Jose, a defeat
which is all the more pregnant - with meaning"
twcritiFe Gage and his gang chose that city
election as the scene of easiest victory. Santa
Clara County was regarded as one of their
strongholds, but San Jose In her might rose
and ' struck a mighty blow which brought de
feat to Mackenzie â to Mackenzie, the best ar
mored knight in the Gage coterie, to whom the
fight had been entrusted. ' _:
The example set by San Jose is worthy at
emulation, and all indications point to lha
repudiation of Gage and his gang at the fall
elections. â¢
It is stated that Cleveland has bought a fishing
ground on the. shores of .Lake Erie and will not try
the ocean any more. It looks" as if the old' man had
made up his mind to move westward and grow up
with the lake trout. â¢ . Â¦ -
â¢ All the people take part in spirit or in act in to
day's ceremony, and its lesson goes to the betterment
of life and the sweetening of its aims and purpose.
The day is hallowed to human fellowship. May all
hearts profit by its great lesson. .
In this great though gradual change that brings
men together we have the sure guarantee that there
is to be no like strife again. Its sacrifices are -the
common boast of all, its^ heroism the. pride of every
State. In this 1 result the .memory of the dead -is
greatly dignified. They died not unto strife, but
unto peace. -The, cause of their sacrifice, in its. larger
aspect, was that love might finally replace hate, and
friendship enmity. While it may be a commentary
on the weakness and :willfulness of men that- such a
price should be paid for what .ought to -be without
it, we cannot look back of the result nor of their
part in it. Let the living take the lesson .'Â¦ to heart
and make a high resolve. to so live that in all time
that is to be hate shall not besom the world in order
that love may follow to weep for the dead who pre
pared the way in great pain and awful 'suffering.
A political and geographical union is of little
worth. It was the dream and hope of the fathers of
the republic that it would be a union of common
sentiment as the master motive of fellow countrymen.
In the hard days when this sentiment seemed to be
effaced in the passion of the time, it was Lincoln's
hope that it would come again, and the mystic chords
of memory would bind Americans Â¦ together < once
more. . He did not live to see that consummation,
but his hope has been justified. We hear every day
less and less said about the hateful features of the
great civil strife, and the people of the North and the
South are meeting as fellow citizens of the same great
nation, each, feeling his personal responsibility for
its material welfare and good repute.
The passion that has passed was natural. It in
hered in the nature of man. The friendly feeling that
takes its place is just as natural, and presents the
nature of man in its more pleasing and, fortunately,
its more permanent aspect.
At first the day had in it bitterness that was not
born -of sorrow. , Human nature carried revenges
beyond . the grave, and the heat of sectional strife
withered the flowers in, their most poetic meaning.
But^jime covers battle-fields with verdure.. The
blossoms sweeten the air that was. murky' with
powder smoke, and birds sing where cannon roared
and musketry rattled. The scenes -where men met
misery and dreadful death are now peaceful and bear
no trace of the high action that makes them his
toric. They had their analogue in the, stormy pas
sions of men which long survived the anger and "the
agony of battle. ' But here, too, time has laid a gentle
hand, and memory of the fallen is no longer embit
tered by the prejudices and hatred that s caused the
contention in which they fell. To-day in many a
graveyard the blue and the gray meet to do honor
to the courage of the dead on both sides, which has
come to be accepted as the country's comnicm heri
tage. ; ; \, :Â¦
. To-day the people of the United States remember
their dead who served in the great Civil War. This
memorial service originated in the South. When
that section sat in the ashes of. defeat and humilia
tion, every hope gone, every ambition quenched, the
past a bitterness unbearable and the future. without
light, -the Southern women turned to the one thing
that -was safe from change â the memory of their
dead. Without pomp or formality they sought God's
acre, where the- victims, of many battles slept, and
covered the turf with flowers and - watered it with
tears, which were eloquent with great expression of
a sorrow more pathetic than had ever before been
common to as .many. From that beginning the' cus
tom soon spread to the North, and now both sec
tions remember their dcacl who fell in that combat

WHEN the independent government of Cuba
was to' -be â¢Â¦ inaugurated, and/before, its :flag
was given to the. breeze, the grateful people'
visited the resting-places of the revolutionists who
died in the struggle for liberty, and the spot where
martyr prisoners were murdered, and by prayers and
wreaths and chaplets expressed their gratitude to the
dead. It is a scene that stands alone in history, a
Homeric picture which some poet of the future may
touch and quicken into immortality.

Fred B. Conway and- Robert, E. Lyons,
Deputy County, Clerks, appeared in Judge

structed and arraigned on the charge of
grand larceny by - : trick' and device. By
consent the cases were continued . till
Tuesday. The defendants y were repre

In view of the constant annoyances and
irregularities caused by the withdrawal
of bail money, Judge Mogan yesterday
sent a request to the City Treasurer,
\Varra.nt- and Bond Clerk and County
Clerk' to meet him and the other Judges
in his chambers to-morrow ' at noon to
discuss the whole matter, so as to arrive
at some satisfactory conclusion. He will
also ask the City and County Attorney to
give a wiltten opinion on the . subject.
Judge Cabaniss does not agree with the
order issued by the .Treasurer that all
receipts for bail money be sent to -him
along with the order. The/ Judge says
the receipt is the only, safeguard he had,
and he considers that "an Indorsement on
the back of the order to the effect that
the receipt is in -his possession .should be
satisfactory. .
A rigid investigation is to be made with
the object of determining Just how far the
system of "kiting" bail money' has been
carried on. It was discovered â¢ yesterday
that the bail money of $100 in the case of
Dora Schwarting; charged with cruejty
to a minor child, had been utilized in the
same way as the ?250 deposited by J. M.
Evans In the case of Jessie Holland, Ly
ons, having withdrawn the amount on an
order signed by Judge Mogan at the re
quest; he says, of Conway. :.The money
vias withdrawn while- the case was pend

The Fresno rate case wasr'submitted'to
Judge Kerrigan yesterday after a lengthy
argument by the attorneys for the Rail
road Commission and Southern Â¦ Pacific.
The argument was opened by F. H. Short
of Fresno, who contended that the re
duction of the rate was caused by the
competition of the Valley road. He was
followed by J. E. Foulds for the railroad,
who took the stand that the rate was a
epecial one, and that therefore to change
it it was not necessary to consult with
the Commissioners. \
John Garber followed Foulds, and the
argument was closed by Attorney General
Ttrey L. Ford. The State's attorney held
that Garber's claim that the constitu
tional law granting the Commissioners
the right to supervise the rate question
was invalid was erroneous.

ARGUMENTS ON RATE. CASE
. Captain Seymour Â¦ detailed Detective
Codv on the case, and he made a report
yesterday. Hinckley, who has a wife and
children In Los Angeles, left there On
May 15, and arrived here the following
day, going to the residence of Professor
O. L. Leinau, 282 Valencia street. He
slept there that night and next morning
wrote a letter to his wife. He left the
house shortly before 10 o'clock saying he
was going to Sacramento, where he was to
meet a man who was to accompany him
to the mines. That was the last Leinau
saw of him. Both he and his wife said
that Hinckley acted very strangely while
with them. Before leaving he gave Lei
nau his watch chain and K. of P. badge to
keep for him. Â¦ .
Hlnckley's baggage . was sent to the
Ufflon Transfer Company, and was taken
from, their office on May 17 to a saloon at
CODY MAKES REPOBT.
I told him to come right up. It was dan
gerous, but he said it looked all right . and'
be would not etay long. But. he did. He
worked considerable, time and then I heard
him call out, "I have struck water; pull me
up quick." Just as I started to work the
windlass I heard a slump in the shaft 'and I
tried with all my might to turn- the windlass,
but I could net. I looked down and saw water
gathering over the fallen gravel and then I
heard another slump of fallen gravel and an
other and another. Whether the heavy stones
settled on the rope or the water â¢shrinking- it
or from other causes I do not know, but the
rope creaked under a terrible strain and finally
one end of the windlass broke and It and one
Bide of the frame went down the shaft. . I
stepped back and In a short time . the other
side of the frame, which had been thrown
over, tell down with a lot of travel over the
edge. In my fright I shouted with all my
might, but there was no help within several
miles, the nearest postoffice being about twelve
miles away. I saw that the entire shaft
would cave in and that Mr. Hinckley was past
all human help. Then I came away. The
property was supposed to be very valuable
and I was sworn not to disclose the location,
and as it would do no possible rood I will
keep my oath and be true to the company.
Mr. Hinckley wore diamonds and - had a gold
watch. Whether he had them, on when he
went down the shaft I do not know. .
HEABS SLUMP IN SHAFT.
I was employed by a mining company to
take A. G. Hinckley of Los to look
over their property. Well, we went there. -A
member of the company was expecting to go,'
but he tot sick and Mr. Hinckley and I went
there. The first shaft we went to was sunk
through gravel about 90 feet to the bedrock
and come gophering had been done at the bed
rock. Mr. Hinckley went down the shaft and
then I let down the tools. He called un and
said that one side of the shaft had caved in,
but be said he could get some nuggets from
the other side.
â¢ The murder theory was "advanced
through an anonymous letter received by
Postmaster Groff of Los Angeles. It bore
on the envelope the''pos"tmark of "San
Francisco. May 23." The writer refused
to disclose his name for fear that he
might be suspected, of murder, nor would
he disclose the location ,ot the mine, as
he was under oath to the. owners not to
do so. In the letter the writer, says^
v . possible murder of A. G. Hinck
ley, a prominent. lawyer of that city. In
a dispatch in yesterday's papers from Los
Angeles the fear was expressed that
Hinckley had been murdered at a mine
hear Placerville, and that his body lies in
a shaft with ninety feet of gravel on top
.of it. ' . ' .."

LOSES FIVE POUNDS!
"What did you weigh, captain." asked
Gavin McNab, counsel for Mrs. Salmond,
"at the time you began to lose flesh
through worry?"
"Oh, a couple of hundred pounds," re
sponded Salmond. "235, I think."
"What was your weight when you got
through, worrying?"
"Two hundred and thirty pounds, sir.".
Whereat the lady friends of Mrs. Sal
mond smiled broadly.
Salmond. 'who was sued for mainten
ance by his wife some time ago, answered
her complaint by charging her with
treating him cruelly and asking for a di
vorce. Mrs. Salmond promptly filed a
cross-complaint accusing the mariner of
mur:y actions not exactly those of a good
husband. Captain Salmond denies the
allegations vigorously and appeared in
court yesterday prepared to prove the
falsity of his wife's charges. He brought
h;s entire ship's company with him. for
Mrs. Salmond frequently took trips on
the Wellington, and the men are sup
posed to know which of the litigants
caused all the trouble. Mrs. Salmond,
while not so strongly reinforced as the
ce plain, was ably supported by a number
ot lady friends willing to tell of the mari
tal infelicities of the couple. ' The ladles
will have a chance to talk to-day, for
Captain Salmond occupied the witness
stand during yesterday's hearing.
The mariner testified that his wife
caused him a great deal of mental worry
and embarrassment by accusing him
of paying attention to the ladies
who frequently took passage on his ves
sel. She made the accusation in the pres
ence of his officers, he said, humiliating
him to a great degree and shattering his
nerves. The captain on one of these oc
casions, according- to his tale, lost flesh
by reason of her conduct. . â¢
That there is a vast difference between
the sea of matrimony and the briny

ship Wellington, the storms of the deey
arc naught to those that come after mar

uates his felicitations upon their aca
demic success, and added words of en
couragement on that day when they
would go out into the world.
The Archbishop, addressing the grad
uates, craved ; indulgence while he said
something about the sisters of St. Vin
cent's School. Their modesty had caused
them to withhold their names in connec
tion with the exercises that had been so
much enjoyedâ indeed, there had not been
the slightest reference to themselves,
though this was the golden jubilee of St.
Vincent's, founded just fifty years ago.
His Grace paid gentle tribute to their
years of labor for the divine master to
bring teachings of their religion to thou
sands of children in the city. He gave
a vivid illustration of the early days, the
time of Bishop Alemany, whose memory
lie begged the assemblage to revere,
when the sisters first came to San Fran
cisco, which was then a village. He ex
tolled their work, for they went to the
homeless and ministered to the. pick and
.gave consolation to the bereaved, for all
of which a debt of gratitude was due the
sisters of St. Vincent that could not be
put in words. He tendered them heart
felt thanks, beseeching upon their labors
the blessings of almighty God.
ABCHBISHOFS ADDRESS.
The pupils made a brilliant display of
talent. As Instrumentalists ,the children
exhibited a remarkable accuracy; as dan
cers they showed a rare grace ; as pian
ists the pupils of the St. Vincent sisters
proved their, musical training to be ad
mirable and thorough. The boys of St.
Patrick's School were no less successful,
whether as brave young soldiers and sail
ors or humorous Brownies, characters as
sumed by the pupils with such consum
mate skill as to send the vast audience
Into shrieks of laughter.
And when all the fine entertaining was
done, when the dance and the drama and
the singing and the military irianeuvers
were completed and applauded to the
echo, the very serious part of the pro
gramme, the awarding of the , honors to
the â¢ graduates, was performed by Arch
bishop Riordan, assisted by the Rev. Fa
ther Cummins.
The golden jubilee celebration and an
nual commencement of St. Vincent's
School, In conjunction with the gradu
ating exercises of St.. Patrick's School,
were celebrated yesterday at the Grand
Opera-house. . '
Judge Heacock stated that he would
render a decision on Monday holding the
captain to answer before the Grand jury,
and in the meantime his counsel would
have an opportunity of getting: out a writ
of habeas corpus to test the jurisdiction
of the District Court, the counsel having
set up that the matter - was one that
should be dealt witn by court-martial.
Mate Carsted was discharged.
Captain Martens and Mate Carsted ap
peared before United States Court Com
missioner Heacock yesterday afternoon
on preliminary examination on the charge
of violation of a Federal statute prohib
iting on shipboard at sea any form of
corporal punishment other than feeding
on bread and water for a limited period
and ironing in the ship's brig. B. Bech
hofer, the third cook of the transport
Buford. told how, for disobedience of or
ders and refusal to work, he hau been
triced up on the bridge of u*e Teasel on
April 2 of this year. The captain, first
mate and other officers â¢ testified that
Bechhofer had on many occasions been
found shirking his work and on other oc
casions had refused to work. He was
punished once for disobeying: orders and
was put on bread and water. He was
triced up for a repetition of the offense
and the witnesses who saw him punished
testified that his heels were on the deck
and that he smiled and grinned at them
when they looked at him.
Major Devol made other changes on
the Buford. First Assistant Engineer
William Morhoft was transferred to thu
Grant, and Third Officer K. Graumn was
dismissed from the service.
Captain A: Crosky of the Grant was
transferred to the Buford in place of the
deposed Martens, and Assistant Engineer
Robert S. Johnson, also of the Grant,
was transferred to the Buford.
Friction on the Buford has been pretty
constant ever since Martens took com
mand. The board of Investigation con
tented itself with a criticism of the se
verity of his discipline. A nap, taken dur
ing his watch on deck, was responsible
for the taking oft of Officer Graumn. The
other changes were deemed advisable in
the Interest of harmony.
The Buford will sail on Monday for
Manila.
United States Court Commissioner
Heacock announced yesterday that he
would hold Captain Martens of the trans
port Buford to answer before the Grand
Jury on the charge of cruelty preferred
by the transport's cook. As the result of
the investigation of the charges of lack
of discipline on the transport Major C.
A. Devol, the general superintendent of
the service at this port, yesterday sus
pended Captain Martens indefinitely.
? /jS^'*^ 0110^ 1 Su P e rinteti(rent Jordan
testified that he had investigated the
facts concerning Blanchard and that the
result of his investigation was the filing
of charges against the principal. This
closed the case, which was then submit
ted to the board for decision.
Blanchard admitted that he had beaten
John Haggio in the manner indicated in
the charges, but thought the punishment
\%as not unusual. He denied with em
phasis that he had secured by violence
a. confession from Raggio that he had
forged his mother's name to a nOte ex
plaining his absence from school.
The developments of the afternoon
were of little interest. Annie Mathlescn,
a former pupil of Miss Perry, testified in
behalf of Miss Perry that she had always
counseled her pupils to be good. On one
occasion after she was superseded by
Miss Peckham a pupil threatened to roll
marbles across the floor and put a mouse
in Miss Peckham's desk. Miss Perry ad
vised against such conduct. The same
witness told how she was present in
Miss Perry s room when Blanchard talked
v/lth her relative to the report on Rag
gio s punishment. Miss Perry seemed
surprised at what Blanchard said and
the witness heard her correct Blanchard
as to Raggio's age. The witness after
ward called upon Director Roncovleri and
narrated to him the circumstances of
Raggio s beating
Blanchard testified, relative to the re
port on corporal punishment, that an un
authorized interpolation had been made
therein by Miss Perry. He admitted
having made several suggestions to her
concerning the report, but she had made
certain statements therein contained of
her own volition: â¢
"That is talse!" shouted Miss Perry
"excitedly. "It is utterly false."
'â¢Take your seat!" commanded Chair
man Denman severely.
S?\ .? ld not tnlnk he â¢>uld falsify like
that, was Miss Perry's rejoinder as she
seated herself.
Miss Emma L. Perry, the teacher who
figured â¢ conspicuously in the prosecution
of Dr. -M. E. Blanchard, principal of. the
Hancock Grammar School, on charges of
falsifying a record and inhumanly beat
ing a pupil, virtually called Dr. BJanchard
a liar during the proceedings yesterday.
The irate teacher, whose veracity, was
questioned on the previous day, was re
peatedly urged by the Directors to main
tain quiet, and finally she was directed
to leave the room. Miss Perry declined
to leave and the trial was resumed.

the faith imposed in him by the business

REDWOOD CITY, May 29.â John
Gunning, who Tor many years
has held, the position here of city
night watchman, has disappeared
This Is regarded by the brotherhood
men as a complete victory, as they claim
they have a majority of the carpenters in
their ranks. The district council of the
brotherhood met last night, but adjourned
betore being apprised of the action taken
by the Building Trades Council. Some of
the brotherhood men who were seen after
the meeting said they were willing to
abide by the decision of Â»the majority of
carpenters, provided the Building Trades
Council does the same. The spirit of the
resolution gives this assurance, so that a
declaration of peace between the warring
factions may soon be looked for.
Resolved. That by reason of that fact the
Building Trades Council calls upon all con
tractors and builders to insist upon this con<
troversy being brought, to a close Immediately
"Whereas, The Building Trades Council has
on three different occasions, beginning with
November 17. 1901. April 14, May 22 and May
29. 1902, decided by unanimous vote that since
all the other trades, save the carpenters, were
satisfied with the constitution and the clause
in controversy, that the clause known as sec
tion 3. article 2. of the constitution be. in bo
far. as the carpenters were concerned. Â¦ revoked,
and the said carpenters allowed by" majority
votp of all carpenters in the rnlona In this dis
trict of San Francisco to decide whpt central
body or bodies- they may belong to; : therefore,
be it \ -Â¦ *'Â¦'Â¦Â¦ N
: Resolved. By the Building Trades Council In
regular session assembled, that in view of the
action hereinbefore mer.tloned as having been
taken by this council, there is r.o barrier In the
way of the will of the majority of all car
penters of Pan Francisco being registered either
.for or against the Building Trades Council or
both; and be it further Â¦
It is thought by some that he may have
taken a night freight train and left this
vicinity and will be found wandering
about in some near-by cityâ possibly in
San" Francisco. % â¢
section 3 of the constitution of the coun
cil prohibiting any affiliated union from
belonging to .any central body other than
that of the Building Trades Council.
Brotherhood Union 483 of carpenters,
which was affiliated with the Labor Coun
cil, refused to abide by this provision and
it accordingly withdrew from the Building
Trades. In retaliation for this act the
council called out union nien of all kind3
wherever they were found working, on
any job with brotherhood carpenters. This
caused dissension and the builders were
greatly inconvenienced by'the stoppage of
operations. Committees were appointed
and numerous conferences with the war
ring factions resulted, with a view to the
restoration of peace. ,
At the meeting of the Building Trades
Council last night the matter of repealing
the section came up and was discussed.
It was finally decided to leave the settle
ment of the question to a majority of the
carpenters themselves, when the follow
ing resolution, offered by Delegate J. Co
field of the. Plumbers' Union, was present
ed and adopted:
All day yesterday parties, headed by
Sheriff Mansfield,- scoured the near-by
fields and hills, but no trace of Gunning
could be found. Professor Rosseter sent
mit fifty of his High School boys to Join
14 the search, and every creek, ravine and
building was eiosely examined, but'with
out avail. This morning * large party
hunted the creeks and marshes to the
north and east of here and another party
started out this afternoon to drag the
creeks, but no sign of the missing man
has, been found. N - â - 'â¢â¢ â¢
trust another with his work. He seemed
to be Â¦ despondent and dropped occasional
remarks which, now being recalled, add
strength to the supposition that he may
have committed suicide.

DEL AGO A WINS THE MAY
STAKES AT GRAVESEND
The Commissioners of Insanity carefully
examined the pitiful subject and at oncÂ»
came to the conclusion that he is hope
lessly demented. The child was therefore
ordered committed to the hospital for m
pane persons at Napa by order of Judge
Hebbard and he was sent to that insti
tution late yesterday afternoon.
Dr. McLaugrhlln said he Tiad noticed fc.r
some. time- t-hat sonwthlne ,was wrong
with the child. He would try to hurl him
self into the fire and would viciously at
tack the other children at every oppor
tunity. At times his hearing seemed to be
all right for he would listen to what was
being said and apparently seemed to com
prehend its meaning. He never uttered a
word and the power of speech seems to
have forsaken him forever.
He added that the unfortunate little
one's father was a seafaring man and
that his mother is dead. While the father
is away at sea he leaves the lad in charge
of the colored "woman and the treatment
he received was not the best for one so
young and so unfortunately afflicted.
Further than this Ryan knew absolutely
nothing: about the lad.
According to Dr. McLaughlin's story
the child was left at Mount Saint Joseph's
Crphanage on May 22 by James Ryan,
who gave his address as the Press Club.
Ryan told the sisters that he found the
child in a lodging-house conducted by a
colored woman and brought him to the
crphanage so that he might receive proper
care.
A pitiful case was presented to the In
sanity Commissioners yesterday afternoon
when Dr. Albert McLaughlin brought
Mannie Janson, 4 years of age, who is
deaf and dumb and insane, before the com
missioners to be' sent to some institution
for demented persons. The boy is a hand
some, curly haired little fellow, but his
reason is entirely gone and It seems be
yond the power of medxeal skill to ra
store it.

Pitiful Case of Child Who Can
BOY OF FOUR YEARS
SENT TO NAPA ASYLUM
The appeal in the case of the Queen
Elizabeth Company, Limited, and Puget
Sound Tugboat Company against Charles
Kelson and his steam schooner Lakme
v.as argued yesterday before Judges Gil
bert, Ross and Hawley In the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals. Judg
ment had been given In the lower court
against the respondent, and the argu
ment yesterday .was on Nelson's appeal.
E>. C. Hughes, Preston, Carr & Gilman
and Page, McCutchen. Harding &
Knight represented the companies and
Nathan Frank argued the case for Nel
son. ;
The libel was brought to recover dam
ages for injuries suffered by the Britsh
ship Queen Elizabeth in a collision on
April 14, 1900, between that vessel and the
Lakme. At the time of the collision the
ship was navigating the waters of Piiget
Sound in tow of the tug Tyee, bound
from Port Townsend to Port Blakeley.
The libel charged negligence on the
part of, the Lakme In answering a signal
from tne Tyee that the latter with her
tew would direct her course to port, with
a signal that she would do likewise,
whereas she did the opposite and directed
her course to starboard, thus precipitat
ing a collision between herself and the
Queen Elizabeth. One of the chief points
a; issue is the respective responsibility of
the Tyee and the Queen Elizabeth for
damage done to the Lakme on the cross
libel. The case was taken under advise
ment and the court adjourned until Mon-
"of Tower and Towed Before
Appeal Judges. -

By a vote of three to one in committee
to-night the bill introduced by Council
man Bishop at ,the Mayor's request, to
place a practically prohibitive license of
$1200 a year on professional boxing con
tests, was killed.
When, the measure was read before the
ordinance and judiciary committee this
evening, a lively discussion was provoked.
Councilman Boyer objected to the bill,
claiming that it would hurt the West
Oakland Athletic Club and the Reliance
Athletic Club although aimed at the Acme
Club.
Bishop replied that the amateurs would
â¢only have to pay $100 a year, and that :t
could not injure those clubs.
'Wlxson discoursed about "somebody in
the front room," referring to the Mayor's
office, as being responsible for the pro
posed ordinance. .
Fitzgerald thought it had not been in
troduced In good faith. .-."'.
"The ordinance proposes to stop prize
fighting in Oakland," declared Council
man Wallace, "and it is a good measure."
Again Wixson ' asked : "Who originated
this bill?"
\'It doesn't make any' difference about
that," replied Bishop. â¢
"I move we recommend its- indefinite
postponement," said Wixson. The vote
was: Ayesâ Courtney, Fitzgerald, Wixson;
no. Bishop; absent, Bon.
"That kills it," remarked BisTiop.

Governor Sanford B. Dole of the Ter
ritory of Hawaii was the guest at a din
ner given in his honor this evening by
Alexander Young at the Young home, on
Vernon Heights. Covers were laid for
seventeen gentlemen. They included sev
eral boyhood rriends of Governor Dole
and others with whom he has been as
sociated in a business or diplomatic
way for many years. Mr. Young, the
host, was Minister of the Interior in tn-j
cabinet of Mr. .Dole when he was Presi

bunkoed. It was so cold and clammy that
the debonair dentist's blonde mustache is
out of curl. His spring overcoat is wilt
ed. His Dunlap doesn't fit. and every
where he turns he meets a hard, coarse
laugh.
It was a bitter pill for the doctor. He's
known in at least two cities as a good fel
low who has had his eyeteeth cut. But
an Algernon with the latest slang from
Hyde Park and Rotten Row won his gold.
It was awfully easy, don't cher know.
Now the dentist, strange to say," doesn't
feel a bit revengeful. Of course, he poured
his vials, not of wrath, but of deep dis
tress, into the cars of Chief of Police
Hodgrkins and Assistant District Attorney
Samuels. But that is only a matter if
form.
When a clever chap drops into town,
carrying an aristocratic air and a really
charming English accent, less experienced
men of the world than Jack Dunn are
apt to be caught. Algernon rushed mat
ters so rapidly that two weeks' acquaint
ance with the dental operator paved the
way for the gentle "toucn."
Well, Algernon has disappeared, and it
is now a matter for police investigation.
Among Jack Dunn's friends the story is
being quietly circulated that he Intends to
go on a farm and gather a little expe
rience.
"No funds," and Jack Dunn had been

"I say. olfl man, just cash this little
matter of fifty pounds for me," said Al
gernon Moffatt of London. England.
"With pleasure. Don't you want some
more?" was Dentist Jack Dunn"s genial
response as he passed out the glittering
eagles to his newly found friend from
over the seas.
This dialogue occurred a couple of
weeks ago. To-day the check came back.

Besides thosa drowned there were in the

Herbert Martin succeeded in saving
his mother, one sister and Mrs. Jones.
After taking them to shore he swam
back to save the remainder of the party,
but became exhausted and was drowned

NEW YORK. May 29. â The new commit
ments In the stock market to-day were of ln
elgnl&cant proportions because of the fear of
possible developments of the triple holiday.
There -was some closing of open accounts, how
c- vtr. and as these proved .to be mostly on the
ehort Â«ide the tone of the market was rather
Cnn, in sympathy with the leaders. The move
ment in the general list was listless and very
narrow. The leader of the market in point, of
activity wÂ»e Reading and its advance of nearly
two points was attributed in large degree to the
demand from shorts to cover in the fear that
a strike settlement might be reached between
now and next Monday. The immediate newt
to-day did not favor such a presumption. Pres
ident fowler of the Ontario and. Western au
thorized emphatic denials of reports that con
cessions to the strikers were contemplated upon'
the .part of the operators. The reported utter
ance of F. P. Eargent of the arbitration com
mittee of the Civic Federation that he believed
a sympathy strike would open among the soft
coal miners was also given some attention,
but thie did not reassure traders short of. the
market sufficiently to induce them to remain
uncovered for Â«n Interval of three days. The
so vane* in Canadian Pacific was also renewed. -
In spite of denials of reported buying for con
trol In behalf of. Northern Securities interest.'
An Irteresting feature of the week's currency
movement is the shipment to Canada of some
$2Â«Â«0O00 by Canadian branch banks, which is
>*uppoBed to be due to tranractlcrji in Canadian
Facific. Notwithstanding this movement and the
iosorptlon cf nearly a million dollars on sub
treasury operations, . tbe receipts of cash from
the interior on balances are estimated thus far
thle meek at *iearly $1,000,000, thus promising
a strong bask et&tetnent for next Saturday.

j NEW YORK. May 29.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say :
The week's developments have been largely
favorable. Crop conditions, particularly those
of the- spring sown cereals and cotton, have
thown further improvement. The labor sit
uation, particularly that In the coe.1 trade, has
likewise measurably Improved, advices toward
the end of the week pointing to the anthracite
strike ending before the position as to supplies
becomes critical. Cool weather, it Is true, ha.6
retarded retail demand and measurably checked
reorder business with jobbers, and heavy frosts
have done damage to vegetables on the'north
ern edge of the country, but this is regarded
as a ,merely temporary halt, and the general
volume of business has been helped by the large
amount booked for next autumn's delivery
Among the industries activity still rules, with
iron and steel, hardware, lumber, the build
ing trades and bituminous coal displaying ex
ceptional activity. Failures continue well down
to the minimum and bank clearings are begin
ning to compare better with a year ago. Rail
way earnings hold all the former advantages
ehown over preceding years. . Gross railway
earnings returns to Bradstreet's for the third
week of May point to nearly 9 per cent increase
over a year ago. Large fruit crops are indi
cated this year, and the same is true of vege
tables, but the latter are backward on cold
weather. High prices for tobacco Indicate that
a heavy acreage will be planted. Iron and
uteel are quieter as regards new. business In fin
ished products, but there are reports of large
transactions pending In the cruder forms.
Wheat, Including flour, exports for five days
aggregate 8.900.645 bushels, against 6,184,839
bushels last week, six days, and 4,138,680
bushels in this 'week last year. - .
WJieat exports, July, 1901,- to date (forty
eight weeks) aggregate 233,425,080 bushels
against 192,812,721 bushels last season.
Business failures for the week number 163
as against 152 last week. 144 In this week last
year, 135 in 1900, 129 In 1899 and 178 In '1898.
Failures In Canada' for the week number 18
as against 19 last week -and 21 a year ago.
There is no further ehange in Butter, the sit
uation Btahdlng precisely as during the past
two or three days. Dealers are stopping pack
ing in the country as fast as possible, but are
forced to pack the major portion of the local
receipts, as they are three times more than the
market can absorb. If the cessation of packing
results In the expected accumulation of stock

wlll.be resumed and the present conditions will

have been killed out In large patches, and

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
tary leader of a statement on next Monday
concerning- the peace negotiations was regarded
in speculative circles as tantamount to an an
nouncement of peace.
To-day's bond market shared In the dullness
of the stock market, and the closing was stag
nant below the best. Total sales, $2,250,000.
Speculation In stocks this week - has been
rather neglected and the course of prices has
been hesitating and irregular. This ha* been
partly due to the approach of the triple holi
day, with IU possibilities of important devel
opments at a time when the closed market
would preclude the opportunity of taking ad
vantage of them. The continuation of the an
thracite miners' strike has had gome repressive
influence upon speculation, but has net weak
ened the coal stocks themselves. The short
age of coal has had a perceptible effect upon
other industries, notably Iron and steel, and
there has been the dread that the trouble would
spread to . the soft . ccal fields, by sympathy,
which would be a damaging thing for the Iron
trade. But the undertone of sentiment in Wall
street Is very confident that the anthracite
companies have it within their power to settle
the strike by very slight concessions whenever
they consider it desirable to do so, and If they
see greater advantage in that course than in
fighting out the Issue raised by the miners.
Other portions of the stock lUt have not fared
so well as the coalers and the explanation of
the heavy tone of the market Is not superficial
ly plain. With the exception of the anthra
cite strike, conditions have appeared extraor
dinarily favorable. In spite of the great shrink
age In the volume of grain traffic compared
with this time last year, railroad earnings con
tinue to show an average percentage of in
crease over last year of 8 per -cent or more.
The movement of general merchandise, espe
cially westbound, is very large and railroad
rates are 6aid to be maintained with a steadi
ness not experienced for a long time. The
maintenance of rates Is attributed in a degree
to the results of investigations by the Inter
state Commerce Commission bringing out the
fact of - concessions on pecking house products,
and leading to the issuance of judicial Injunc
tions to the railroad companies against disre
garding published schedules. The news fronj
the crop region during the week has been uni
formly favorable. The general assumption ot
speculation is that the present year's corn
crop will - be abundant, and only definite daro
sge to the crop will disturb that assumption.
The rates for call money have fallen to such
a low stage as to offer no apparent explana
tion of the dull speculation. But doubt on the
future resources of the money market may
easily have more to do In restraining specula
tion than is evident. Not a few bankers ex
press the view that money rates must advance
and admit that they are keeping funds avail
able in call loanÂ£ rather than tie them up In
time loans. In the expectation that all classes
ot interest rates are to advance. The large
banking and railroad Interests seem to t><
agreed that policy forbids the encouragement
of speculative activity at this time, which
might threaten a recurrence of the unhealthy
conditions which have been relieved within a
few weeks by a process of credit .contraction.
The. enormous borrowing abroad and from In
terior points which, has been accomplished, ne
cessitates provision for future payments. Thi?.
resumption of large exports of corn with . the
maturing of the present crop is relied "on to re
pleitiBh~the' foreign exchange market and fa
cilitate remittances for repayment of foreign
obligations. The numerous comments upon the
present large expansion of credits both by banks
and trust companies and the Inadequacy of the
banks' cash reserved for both is believed to
have led the trust companies to adopt a policy
of gradual recuperation of their own cash re
serves.
The bond market has been dull and Irregular.
United States bonds were all unchanged com
pared with the closing call lart week.

CHICAGO, May 29.â Most of the Influences
in the wheat pit . favored sellers, . and the sup
port from a strong quarter and the comparative
firmness of the foreign markets kept prints
fairly firm for the first hour.. Cables showed
a little decline, but were not bearish. Ad
vices tlid state, however, that there was pres
sure of spot wtTeat upon the English market,
a great quantity of stuff due to arrive off the
coast and fine' weather abroad. Buying by a
big house that suggested satisfaction with the
price brought in a number * of tailers and
helped prices. For a time corn helped wheat,
but it soon became apparent that-.the''bears
had the situation In hand again. The weather
In the winter country was warm with rains
and in the Northwest clear and warmer. Bears
laid great stress on this argument and were
thriving on tine crop prospects. Receipts weie
Increasing. In the way of novelty a car of
new Texas wheat was shipped in and on .its
harvesting the Southwest sold. No additional
export business came to the relief and every
thing slumped. July opened %@%c to a shade
lower at 7JS%@72Â«ic and dipped to 72c. closing
weak, %c down, at 72%@72%c.
In 'corn cables showed indifference to our
slump yesterday and the bull crowd supported
the market fairly well, for a' time. Trad*
turned very bearish later on heavy receipts,
bears sold short and crop reports were good.
July closed weak, %c lower, at 62%@62%e.
The only feature of the trade In oats was
the nervousness accompanying the May "deal."
Several small traders in this option did~ some
business. Many of the shorts in May are
settling quietly with the operator who success
fully cornered that delivery. It is now thought
the "deal" is practically over. July followed
corn, closing weak, %@%c down, at 30% c .
The strike of the teamsters of the big Chi
cago packing-houses began to have a bearish
effect on provisions - to-day. At - the opening
prices were strong and the packers supported
the -market.' but the trains wefe mostly lost
when the grain markets broke: July pork
closed 2%c down, lard a shade lower and ribs

The demand for Berries was fair and attract

George Center of the Federation of Mis
sion . Improvement Clubs said that the
organization is not opposed to the grant
ing of the new franchise, but it 13 opposed
to the maintenance of the tracks through
the Mission district. . Center declared thzir
the franchise should not be granted unle*.^
the company agrees to remove the tracks
in the Mission. Center said that section
8 of the proposed ordinance referring *o
the maintenance of the tracks,, is opposed
by' the people in the Mission.
M. Mujlaney protested against grranthvar
the. franchise and requested a continuance
for one week. D. J. Shine said the rail
road â¢ running close to his residence has
damaged his Interests to a great extent.
A. B. Maguirc thought the company
should be given two years in which *o
build . the bay shore line and upon 'the
completion of the road the Mission tracks
should be taken up. Thomas Reed and
William Watson objected to the trains
through the Mission.
The Mission and Potrero Improvement
Clubs . filed a petition that the franchise
be denied unless the company flnlshsa
the new road in 18 months and agreed t.i
take up the tracks in the Mission within
two years from the date of completion of
the cut-off line. Eugene Sullivan, secre
tary of- the club, said that all the resi
dents of the Mission district have for
years been endeavoring to cause the re
moval of the tracks as a public nuisance
as well as a menace to life and limb.
A. F. . Roberts, president of thÂ© Ocean
.View Improvement Club, spoke in favor
of the maintenance of the tracks through
the Mission. Roberts said that the res
idents of Ocean View district were put to
great inconvenience during the recent
strike and. the train . service was a great
accommodation.
WANT TRACKS REMOVED.
The Supervisors' Street Committee met
yesterday for**the purpose of considering
the application ' of the' Southern Pacift j
Company for .a franchise to operate a
"cutoff" line from Sunnydale avenue to
Sixth' street. A number of citizens ap
peared to oppose the granting of the new
franchise, while improvement club repre
sentatives urged that a condition be ex
acted in the ordinance requiring the
company to take up its tracks in the
Mission. The company was- represented,
by Attorney W. F. Herrin. General Man
ager Kruttschnitt. Jere T. Burke aJ\fc^
Chief Engineer Wood. f
General Manager Kruttschnitt statea
that In the construction o* the shore line
it is Intended to build four tunnels. At
present 43 trains pass through the Mission
dally, but that number would be reduced
to four upon the completion of the road.
The tracks in the Mission would, be main
tained to be used should occasion require.
Kruttschnitt said, as the company does
a large freight business through ta Ocean
View.
D. A. and H. A. Tessmer protest**'!
against granting the franchise on the

the increase by a majority of the board
at the caucus* on Wednesday there can be
no question of its^ advisability.
"We -will have an additional revenue of
about $350,000." said Connor, "if we raise
the license. to $200. Of this amount I
would be Jn favor of apportioning $100.00i
to the. schools. $100,000 to the Police De
partment and $150,000 to the Improvement

Supervisor Connor Intimated ' yesterday
that ah .ordinance will be Introduced at

for an increase in the retail liquor license
to $200 per year. When Connor was asked
if he contemplated such a course he re
plied that if the board did not adopt some

DELEGATES OF COUNTIES.
To-day's convention was called,' by the
Santa Clara Valley Improvement Club of
this city, and was the result of the ef
forts of President X. A. Sc.heller. I In/rec
cp-niticn of this work Scheller was made
the first president of the association.
Hale's Hall was wetl filled this morn
ing at the opening hour. There were
nearly 100 delegates present and . many
business men. H. D. Mathews of the im
provement club called the meeting to or
der in the absence of President Scheller,
who is confined to his home- by illness.
He made a short address of welcome. ; He
said the delegates had gathered for the
purpose of advancing the interests of ths
section and knew much would be accom
plished. Assistant Secretary^ McMahill
of the improvement club called the roll
of delegates, and the following persons
answered: Â¦ ' , \
sources exploited 'and its attrac
tions brought to the attention of the peo
ple- abroad. This is to be done through
the California Central Coast Counties Im
provement Association, which was,organ
ized here to-day by delegates froin San
Mateo, San Benito, Santa Cruz, Monterey,
San Luis Obispo and Santa Clara coun
ties and Santa Barbara north of the Santa
Ynez range. . The section . comprising
these counties has not been advertised
tibroad as other localities have, but lately
its citizens have bestirred themselves.
Their preliminary activity culminated in
to-day's convention.
No part of California is richer and has
s:s many attractions as the central coast
section. Its immense orchards and grain
aieas, seaside and mountain resorts,
through which runs the new coast road,
is bound to receive an impetus through
;he advertising that is to be done by the
i\o\v association. . Â». Â¦ * .

Wong See Chung was also
taken to the hospital. It was
not known at 3 o'cl ck how
serious his injuries' were. He
said the men demanded th?
money in the store and when
h 2 refused 5lv>t him. i\- â¢ .
The shot attracted some
Chinese and a fierce confltct
ensued, in which knives and
pistols were freely used.
Sergeant Helms .and several
patrolmen arrived . on the
scene and -succeeded in cap
turing three of the highbind
ers and enough weapons to
stock an arsenal. The high
birders, who were in var bus
stages of dilapidation from
knife wounds, were sent to
the Receiving Hospital to be
catchedup and then trans
ferred to the tanks.

The Republican Primary Leaffue. heaJ
quarters Xo. 16 Geary street, is now giv
ing attention to registration. Citizens
who desire an honest administration of
public affairs should. register at once and
not delay the performance of this duty
A citizen registering at this time will oe
entitled ' to vote at the primary election
August 12 and the general election No
vember 1. The patriotic service of every
good citizen and taxpayer may be re
quired to give the finishing stroke to the
corrupt bosses at the August primary
election. The first duty of the citizen is
to register. An unregistered citizen is
like a soldier witho.it ammunition. In
the battle he cannot hurt the enemy and
is ISkciy to sret hurt. â¢
A few days ago the duty of leading the
boss fight In San Francisco was assigned
to Harbor Commissioner Mackenzie. It
5s now commonly reported that he will
not accept the leadership. As an extreme
resort Gage may send for AguirTe and
Kevane to organize district clubs. . '
In the several Assembly districts of San
Fr&ncisco the demoralization of the boss
forces is unparalleled. The district lead
ers of the old gang do not attempt to
conceal their disgust. They assert that
they cannot set a hint from Herrin.
Burns. Lynch. Johnny Mackt^izie or Jere
Burke as to how they shall line up and
to whom they shall report for orders. .â¢
BOSSES DEMORALIZED.
As there yet remains some patronage
for the Governor to bestow he has a
email following: of the expectant,, but the
knowledge tjiat the next Governor can
recall the appointments before the Legis
lature acts on them has not escaped the
observation of shrewd politicians. The
signs. are that the Gage appointees to the
Id arbor Commission. Insurance and Bank
Â«..lnmiÂ£sions will be retired to the joys of
private life before the next Legislature
adjourns. It is this knowledge that
causes so much anxiety in the boss camp
concerning the man that the machine will
take up when Gage is openly retired from
the race. It is admitted all around that
Gage's chance for a renomination. which
vas not very bright before the San Jose
election and the San Quentin exposures.
nas now completely vanished. Every
body but Gage is aware of this fact. All
The aspirants for the favor of the.Repub
lican State Convention understand the
situation. Gage may entertain the illu
sion that the people desire his renomina
rion, but his right to deceive himself is
:iot questioned. The State officeholders
tvho want the favor of the next Governor
ere very much concerned. They are cast
ing about lo pet points as to the strength
of Preston, Schmitz, Flint, Pardee and
Edson.
The victory of the party in the Novem
ber election of 1898 was accepted by Gage
as a personal triumph and a public in
dorsement of his speech of acceptance.
The real facts are that harmony and
Â¦union of Republican forces, the prestige
of McKinley's patriotic administration
and the war enthusiasm were the causes
of triumph for the party in that election.
At the outset of his administration- Gage
lost the confidence of the best men of the
State by entering Into a political conspir
acy with the Southern Pacific Company
to deliver the United States Senatorshlp
to Dan Burns. Â¦ .
PROUD OF HIS SPEECH.
The cloud of scandal over the Gage ad-'
ministration, caused by the exposure of
the Kern County bond transaction and
the rcvplatiors touching forgery and
theft at the San Quentin Prison, adds to
the general demoralization of the boss
forces. . It is obvious now to the dullest
cf politicians that Gage is too heavy a
load for any political parry to think of
carrying. There is some talk that the
Governor will make a grand stand play
by throwing. Kevane and Aguirre over
board in order to re-establish himself in
the confidence of the people, but his sup
porters who know him best aver that he
will go down to defeat and political exile
with Kevane .and Aguirre as his body
guard.
In the political history of California the
rise and fall of Gage will comprise an in
teresting chapter. Shortly' after he was
discovered th.re were several claimants
for the distinction of his discovery,
among them ColGnei Adolph Gassen of
Ban Diego, \\\ V. Herrin of "this city and
D. M. Burns of Hopland. At present
there is no rivalry among the former
claimants for the distinction appertain
ing to the discovery, but for the sake of
truth in history the real facts should be
developed. History that interests the
public in regard to the best Governors of
a commonwealth is not complete unless
it has some reference to the worst. when
Gage was notified of his nomination he
went before the convention which hon
ored him and made the worst speech ever
made to a nominating assembly.
. The .board adjourned to meet to-morrow
morning for further consideration of the
budget. - :
Brandenstein said that if any. salaries
were raised it was, understood that the
Health Board should not? increase the al
lowance for transportation of inspectors
Braunhart said that no. allowance. should
be made for transportation, which privi
lege, he claimed, had been abused. Emery
said that the board recommended the em
ployment of a veterinary inspector at $125
per month. .
"Irani opposed to any salary raising,"
said -Wilson, "while sewers and streets
are suffering for lack of appropriations."
"The market Inspection: is very impor
tant," said Braunhart. ."I notice that the
Fire Department gets pretty nearly all it
asks for. Whjr should not the Healtb
Department be dealt witn more generous
ly?" ; 'Â¦ 'Â¦ â¢ . . .
"Well, we have the best fire department
in" the world," retorted Maybr Schmitz
. VYes, and- under the most disadvan
tageous circumstances," added Branden
stein. â¢' Â¦' :' ' Â¦ Â¦ . ' :.
Braunhart referred to the fact that the
-Bureau of Engineering Is costing more
than- the office of City Surveyor under
the consolidation act, which did all engi
neering-work. Grunsky replied that more
work was being ' done by his office and
stated that former. -Surveyors received
larger fees for city work that did not ap
pear in the expenditures of the office.
. Secretary Emery of the Board of
Health asked- that provision be made' lo
â¢repair the Smallpox Hospital.
-."The Health Board is deeply interested
in the expansion of its field force, includ
ing, food, market and plumbing inspec
tors," Emery said. "Three plumbers
made 11,000 â¢Â¦ inspections last year and we
suggest that their pay be increased from
$100 to $115, or else that you allow us one
more plumbing inspector and more mar
ket inspectors." \
OPPOSES HIGHER SALARIES.
COSTLY ." ENGINEEBING.
. -Bfaunhart thought' likewise, in view of
the, fact that the company, had secured
valuable' concessions, both from, the city
i and -State. It was decided to send for
Captain A. H.'-Paysori, vice president .-o*
the company, -to lay the matter before
him. The board has under consideration
a resolution of agreement requiring the
'company to build three bridges, on Eigh
teenth, Nineteenth and Twentieth streets,
and the -bridge may be add
ed, v - ' ,' Â¦ . â¢ . > Â¦ . -
The Finance Committee' has Â¦ recommended
$43,900 for sewers, and there is one on Sixth
street which will cost $40,000 alone. On Elev
enth, near Harrison, the sewer Is in such baa
condition that 'it is unsafe to travel In the mid
dle of the street. Commercial street has to. bad
sewer and the proposed sewer extension on
Division street from Channel to . Ninth . would
cost $200,000. Â¦ Paving operations have been de
layed from the bad condition, of. eewers. Th*
city must provide- for this .work even if you
have to go outside of the dollar limit, as you
did â¢Â¦ for : the schools and hospitals. To build
necessary sewers on Mission road will cost
If 40. 000 and $32,770 is required, for a sewer on
Baker street. : . .
' . Our total recommendation for repairing
streets was $350,000. which could be expended
at once. '. It. Is desirable to build a bridge on
Third street across Channel street and* .the San
ta' Fe Company has agreed' to meet one-half the
expense. â¢'Â¦. Â¦Â¦.'.'. . .
"The company should pay the whole
cost," said ' Brandenstein. â¢ ' Â¦Â¦. 1*1 . I r
, City Engineer Grunsky made an appeal
for an appropriation of $509,000 for new
sewers, which he characterized as urgent
work. He said: . "
WANTS NEW SEWERS.
Brandenstein was still advancing and
Braunhart was not away, when
several Supervisors .with tne aid of- Mayor
Schmitz â¢ prevailed- on â¢ Brandenstein to
leave the room in order- to prevent a con
tinuance of the disgraceful incident.
"Don't you say I -am .insane.", said
Brandenstein, in great anger. Â« walking
threateningly toward Braunhart, "or there
will be one loud-mouthed., dirty blather
skite and ; gallery spieler less around
here.". --,',.
Brandenstein rose to speak and things
began to look warm when Mayor Schmitz
begged him not to carry the dispute any
further. The meeting then adjourned and
Brandenstein overheard Braunhart say.
"Why. that man must be insane."
Braunhart started "to reply, but Mayor
Schmitz rapped for order. Braunhart in
sisted on having his say. .
"Am I the only one to be called to
order?" said Braunhart. --, "I lave been
continually criticized and- 1 hope it will
cease. I Insist upon my- right as a mem
ber of this board. If I cannot enforce
it here I will enforce it in some other
place. .There- is no more garrulous mem
ber than the Â¦ gentleman who has [pre
ceded me." Â¦ : . 'â¢ â¢
"When this gentleman," said Branden
stein, "presumes to own the entire board,
including the Mayor, when one member
takes it upon himself to speak tor the
board and gives assurances that .some
thing will be done, I think it is time to
call a halt. I am tired of being owned
by Mr. Braunhart." .
BBANDENSTEN BEPLIES.
' Braunhart ! took exception to this re
mark, saying that I he was tired of con
stant personal allusions to himself.
"I would suggest," put in Brandenstein.
"that- some 'other members of this board
express their views as to how the money
shall be paid."
The incident began when Architect Al
fred Coffey was being questioned regard
ing the plans prepared by him for a new
City and County Hospital under the last
bond issue which had been accepted by
the city, and for which he/putin a. claim
for $5000. After close questioning the
board became satisfied : that the. claim is
a just'one, but was in doubt out of which
fund to pay tjie bill. Braunhart wa3
putting, a series of questions to Coffey.
which he concluded with the following re
mark: .
"Well.'lfwe give/you the assurance
that you* will be gala, out of the revenue
raised from the special levy of 7% cents
for a hospital that will be satisfactory,
will it not?" : .
The meeting of the Board of Supervisors
held yesterday to hear city officials on the
proposed tax budget was disgraced by a
wordy altercation between Brandenstein
and Braunhart. - The interference of
Mayor Schmitz was necessary to prevent
the two belligerents from Indulging- In a
fist fight. Bad blood has existed between
.the two Supervisors for some time past,
but none of It. was ever spilled ; in ' their
verbal bouts. If the Mayor had not
stepped, in and Induced Brandeustein to
walk away Jrom .the scene the trouble
might â¢ have culminated seriously.
