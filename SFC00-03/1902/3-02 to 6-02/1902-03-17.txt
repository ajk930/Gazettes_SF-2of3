of such less rich camps as Forty Mile,

Prospects are good for a similar -rate

Resuming, the Mayor Bald:
"In- the upbuilding of San Francisco the
Irishman has played a conspicuous part.
: The very spot on which, we are sealed was
the property <of Timothy Murphy, an
Irishman who landed here in l>-2tJ. San
Francisco la now a city of 350,000 people,
but I expect that In the next twenty
years it will be doubled. It ia not wealth,
but individuals that make cities - greatâ It
is by the co-operation of individuals that'

ORATORS AND ORATORY.
The Mayor closed with . the ' statement
that he loved Ban- Francisco, as bis birth
place and all he held dear In' this life was
located here; His closing remarks were
greeted with great applause, and when Jt
subsided Neal Power responded to the
toast of "Irish Orators and Oratory." He
spoke eloquently of the great . legacies of
.unsullied virtue and noble accomplish
ments which orators of Ireland have left
to the descendant*. It remained for poor
old Ireland to ' stand pre-eminent . among
the people of the world for the genius of
Its orators and the brilliancy of its ora
tory, he said. Greece had her Demosthe
nes, England -her; Pitt, France her Mira

Ireland bad her Invincible Curran, Burke,

"It was these orators who- battled forre

THE plans for the new church of
St. John, which Is to be erected
on the property adjoining the
parochial residence on the west
side of St. Marys avenue,' near
Mission street, have been completed and
work on the structure, which is to cost
$11,000, will be commenced without delay.
The erection of the new edifice will be
an epoch in the history of the parish and
the building will be a monument to the
perseverance and faithfulness of | Rev.
Father P. Brady, pastor of St. John's.
For a year past Father Brady has been
conducting services in the old St. Mary's
College on College Hill, a sort of ruin,
totally inadequate to the requirements
and in many ways unsuited for the pur
pose to which it was devoted. Â¦ Conscious
of the great Inconvenience suffered by his
flock, Father Brady began the task of
raising funds for a. new sanctuary with
signal success.' The new house, of. wor
ship will have a seating capacity of 500,
and will be in every way. an ornament to
the locality which it will adorn. . . Â¦ -
The plans call for a* church of the Ital-
by the freedom of our laws and the lib
erality of the people who may not rlsa
to the highest place within the gift of
our people. (Cheers.) ' Eternal vigilance
Is the price of liberty; and if we would
preserve our own liberty, we" must hold
inviolate that of our neighbor. We have
no right to withhold from a nation en
gaged in its struggle for Independence
that encouragement which we asked for
and received in the darkest days ''of our
national life. To . that country in South
Africa' now struggling against' British
greed for liberty of action and thought,
every lover of liberty should extend his
heartiest well wishes."
' MAYOB SCHJOTZ'S POEM."*'
The next speaker was Mayor Schmitz-
He was given a tremendous ovation, and
when the applause ' subsided he said in
part:
"While I was sitting In my window
overlooking the beautiful bay of San
Francisco, an inspiration seized roe, and
I wrote the first verse I was ever/ guilty
of. (Applause.) I do not call It poetry,
but merely a few lines put together, under
the impulse of the moment. If you will
pardon me I will read them." (Cries,
"Read them!'.') :.
The Mayor then read the following lines
amid great applause:
When Freedom from the skies abÂ«ve
Looked down â for lands of liberty and love,
She scanned the universe â with kindly, amlle,
Fixed one ctandard on' the Emerald Iele.
She planted there the love of truth;
The spirit and the fire of youth;
And tor. a motto to her eons she israve: ,
"Be ever freemen and not slave."
The stars and stripes v.-lth ' splendid glory

Enwrap our hearts with .firmest hold, Â¦
Yet leave some place for Green and Gold.
intentionâ it Is the cry of agitation the
world over. Let the Irish people never
forget that through agitation mighty na
tional changes are achieved. When
France, with her mighty revolution; and
America, with her uprising against tyran-*
ny, and South Africa, in her battle for
freedom, rose to alarm- the world, the
eceptered kings bleated forth/ their disap
probation In tremulous strains. What the
two first named nations accomplished
Ireland and South Africa are destined to
accomplish. It is a significant fact in the
history of England that its greatest
achievements were the work of Irishmen.
(Cheers.) This illustrates the power of
agitation. To be successful Irishmen
must agitate; they must rise up against
tyranny. If they do this they will never
dim the luster which attaches to the
magnificence of this glorious day."
Joseph Sadoc Tobin was next intro
duced but before he was allowed to speak
to the toast, "The United States," three
hearty cheers for President Roosevelt
were given. Tobin was accorded a warm
reception. He spoke in part as follows:
"It is a glorious thing for a native of
the United States to say a word in behalf
of the country of his fathers. (Cheers.)
To every man of noble impulse the words
freedom and liberty are mighty talismans
to stimulate them to deeds of glory. In the
pages of history, discolored by wars and
the bloodshed of peoples who fought to
throw off the shackles of slavery, are to
be read lessons fraught with Importance
to the cause of mankind. Everywhere
the world over the standard of true
democracy Is recognized In the ] United
States. â¢ â¢
PBICE OF LIBERTY." '
"The history of our great country. Is an
exemplification of the saying that eter
nal vigilance Is the price of liberty. This
country was reared upon ideals which
men must respect everywhere. We know
that snobbery cannot be endured.
(Cheers.) We know that democracy in
this country, coupled with the - brilliant
mission that citizenship imposes upon in
dividuals. Is bound to advance our great
ness as a nation. One line of the Immor
tal Declaration of Independence is worth
more than the achievements of armies
and navies."
The closing remarks of the speaker
were interrupted by vociferous applause,
and at the close of the address Willi
O'Brien sang in good style a patriotic
Irish song. The next toast was "Civil
and Religious Liberty," which was re
sponded to by Judge W. T. Dooling of
Holllster. Judge Dooling said In part:
"The. theme of civil and religious lib
erty brings before us the great panorama
of the history of humankind. Prom the
time the ark settled on Mount Arrarat
to the time of the victory at Yorktown,
the questions of civil and religious liberty
have periodically engaged the attention
of the world. To us for the most part the
question is an academic one, but to our'
forefathers it was one fraught with tre
mendous force. It is a question which
agitates the Irish race to-day, and tho
day is , not far distant when the epitaph
of the tyranny of crowns will 'be writ
ten. (Cheers.) There is one thing beyond
the reach of tyrantsâ the liberty of the
soul. .(Applause.) It was this principle
which prompted our forefathers to the !
performance of deeds of unexampled pa- â¢
triotism and glory. Neither unjust laws 'â¢
nor oppressive regulations have depressed
a race which has for seven â¢ centuries i
been wagring a mighty warfare for free- I
dom. (Cheers.) The voice of mankind is !
uranimous in one great aspirationâ civil
and religious liberty in worship and ac
tion for the human race.
"The civil magistrates may punish
crime, but they cannot restrain opinions;
they may by the enforcement of the law
check the spontaneous utterances of a
people seeking to rise above the condi
tions which fetter them, but they cannot
stem the tide of human advancement
tUong the lines of liberty of worship, lib
erty of conscience and liberty of thought
(Applause.) The principle of true govern
ment is designed to protect .the citizen
and not to aggrandize the ruler. It Is a
principle which we guard with commen
dable jealousyâ it is the principle upon
which the national constitution is j
founded. (Cheers.) Within our boun
daries each man stands on an equal plane
with his fellows. The road of advance
ment Li open to all alike.. There is no
boy In America to-day who may not rlue

Paw Mexican . Cattlemen
Settle an Old Grudge
With Revolvers.
One of the Combatants Dies
From a Wound in the
Left Lung.
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
EL PASO. Tex., March 16.â A pistol duel j
last evening between Billy Gardner and
Eugene Hulin, two prominent New Mexl
caji cattlemen at Leonard, tnirty miles
above El Paso, resulted In the death of
Gardner. Six-shooters of 45-calIber were
the weapons used. Both men harbored
an old grudge and met by chance in a
restaurant at Leonard, where Hulin was
at supper. As eoon as Gardner entered
Hulin sprang to his feet, and both drew
their weapons and commenced shooting.
Gardner's shots missed their ;mark, but
Hulin's first shot penetrated Gardner's
abdomen, but did not stop the shooting.
Hulin fired a second time and the bullet
plowed its way through Gardner's left
lung close to the heart, inflicting a wound
from the effects of which he died an hour
later. As soon as Hulin realized that he
had fatally wounded his antagonist he i
wired the Sheriff at L.as Cruces, New ;
Mexico notifying him of the occurrence
and offering to surrender. He afterward \
went to that place and gave himself up. {
Hulin Is a wealthy cattleman, residing
about thirty-five miles vnst of El Paso.
Gardner resided on his r~nch near An
thony, New Mexico. T x. uble had been
brewing between the two otockmen for
some weeks, and it waa .expected that
bloodshed would follow, a_3 both had the
reputation of being handy with their re
volvers.

General Miles really called on business
very important business it seemed to him.
He laid before the President his plan -to
put an end to the hostilities in the Philip-
S'nes without additional sacrifice of life,
r. Roosevelt, it is understood, suggested
certain modifications in the papers sub
mitted and directed the general to present
themvto the Secretary cf War. This was
done, with the result stated.
Intimate friends of General Miles say
they know nothing of the report that he
and the President had some words about
a month, ago over the Schiey reprimand.
3t was rumored that General Miles had
gone to the White House and had told
Mr. Roosevelt he had been much dis
>turbed by the reprimand administered
by thft direction of the President as the
result of an indiscreet interview- on the
Schiey case, given out by an. army officer,
and that he had convinced himself the
President was not to blame, but that Mr.
Root and Genera! Corbln were respon
sible. The President replied, according: to
the story, that he would have ordered
the reprimand, no matter who had been
on duty in the department.
It is reported on what seem8 good authority
that some ti^ie a?o General Miles atked to be
eeat to the Philippines. He visited the White
House and had an audience with the Presi
dent about a month ago. It was his first ap
pearance there, except at an official function,
since the severe reprimand administered to him
in connection vt-ita the Scaley case.- and the
visit was chronicled as an evidence of a
reconciliation between ti^e President and the
ranking officer ot. the' army.
CALL, BUBBA.U. 1406 G STREET. N.
W.. WASHINGTON. March 16.â It de
veloped to-day that Lieutenant General
Nelson A. Miles of the army made a spe
cific request to the War Deoartment a
month ago to be sent to the Philippines
end In connection therewith submitted a
plan by which, in his opinion, the war
could be brought to an end without fur
ther lo*s of life to either elde. He pro
posed to employ methods similar to those
â¢used by him Â«o successfully In his Indian
campaigns.
Secretary Root, after due consideration,
denied General Miles' reauest and dis
approved the plan submitted. The papers,
so indorsed by the Secretary, were sent
to the White House and the President
subsequently concurred in the Secretary's
action. The final indorsement, disposing
of the matter, is said to bear the date of
M La C effect. President Roosevelt and Sec
retary Root hold that the war to. the
Philippines is already at an end. or vir
tually bo. and that -the adoption of Gen
eral ililes' plan, involving a change of
policy in dealing with the inhabitants of
i^he archipelago, would be unfair to those
fc'Scials. military and civil, whose work

The police at the Central. station have

burglars! who confine their operations to
the territory known as North Beach. Sev
eral crimes have been reported by resi
dents of the district, as well as merchants'
and saloonkeepers. The latest haul made
by the burglars was on, Saturday night,
when they entered the grocery store of
Stulz Bros., at, 633 Montgomery avenue
and stole $160 and a quantity of goods'. '
When a clerk employed by Stulz Bros. ;
came to the store yesterday, morning to
attend to some business that had been

This ; implement of crime had also been
applied to the cash register, a till under

they discovered a sack containing $150 in

SALT XaAJCE. Utah. March U.â Artificial
rubber Is now being made In a small way
In the laboratory of Professor C. H. La
belle of this city, formerly of San Fran
cisco. A company Is being organized to
manufacture the product on an extensive
scale. The process is kept a secret, but
the Inventor says that the principal In
gredients are petroleum distilled from the
oil shale which exists In vast deposits in
Utah, elaterite, albertlte and certain kinds
of talc It Is claimed for the artificial
rubber that In many ways it is superior
to the natural produce, particularly as re
gards durability. It can be produced for
one and a half cents a pound, while crude
natural rubber* sells at upward of a dollar
a pound. It is the Intention of the backers
of the Inventor to erect two extensive
factories. One of these will -be on Long
iBland Sound and the other will be in
Utah. All the materials used are found
in extensive deposits In this State, but
the promoters of the enterprise were un
able to get hold of enough albertlte In
Utah, the principal deposits being In the
hands of others. For that reason , they
have secured extensive deposits in Cuba
and the decision was reached to put up a
factory In the East, because it would be
convenient to reach with the raw material
and because It would be a good distribut
ing: point. Professor Label Je has been
working on his process for several yean,
and has perfected it only recently. It Is
claimed that the artificial rubber ~ has
been submitted to the severest tests, and
that It has undergone them all success
fully.

Delarey's Humane Course.
Lord Kitchener's telegraphic dispatch
showing that the fighting lasted / much
longer than was supposed confirms the
belief that the disaster to General
Methuen's forces was due to leaving too
large a gap between the front convoy
and the rear and to placing an Insufficient
screen .behind the rear guard, which
brought 'about a. panic among the troops
as a result of the Boer onslaught. v-"&
Much resentment is felt here that the
Boers wore British uniforms and badges,
but satisfaction is expressed at the latest
accounts of the affair, as indicating that
the British- troops behaved better than
was supposed from the earlier report.
From either dispatches It appears that
General Methuen was shot while riding
to bring up the mounted troops,- and .that
hls.,horse was killed. After the surren
der General Delarey rode up ttnd treated
General Methuen with the greatest cour
tesy and consideration. He ordered his
return to Klerksdorp under the care of
his own nephew and a medical officer.
According to the Klerksdorp correspon
dent of the Daily Mail, the burghers
were so angry at this that a party of
them went out and brought General
Methuen back. General Delarey, Â¦ how
ever, overruled the objections of the
burghers.
The correspondent of the Daily Mail
pays a tribute to General Delarey'8- hu
manity and describes him as a "brilliant
fighter and a born leader, who brings no
bitterness or. racial feeling to his task,
and who sternly represses any excesses

LONDON, March 16.â The War
Office has received the following
communication from Lord Kitch
ener at Pretoria:
"Lord Methuen has sent me a
staff officer with a dictated dis
patch, from which It appears that
certain particulars previously given
are Inaccurate. The rear screen
of mounted troops was rushed and
overwhelmed at dawn. There was a gap
of a mile between the ox and the mule
convoys. The mounted supports to the
rear of the screen, with General Metbuen,
immediately reinforced by all . the availa
ble mounted troops and a section of the
Thirty-eighth battery, maintained \ thern^
selves for an hour, during which the con
voys were closed up without disorder.
"In the meanwhile 200 infantry were be
ing disposed by Lord Methuen to resist
the Boer attack, which was outflanking
the left of the rear guard. The Boers
pressed the attack hard, and the mounted
troops continuing to fall back, the Infan
try was carried with them In the rout.
Two guns of the Thirty-eighth battery
were thus left unprotected, but continued
In action until every man, -with the excep
tion of Lieutenant Nesham, was hit. Lieu
tenant Nesham was called on to sur
render, and, upon refusing to do so, was
killed.
Lord Methuen-'s Brave Stand.
"Lord -Methuen, with 200 of the North
umberland Fusiliers, and two guns of the
Fourth Battery, then found himself iso
lated, but held on for three hours. Dur
ing this period the remaining infantryâ
namely, one hundred of the Lancashires,
with some forty mounted men, mostly
Cape police, who had occupied the kraal
near the wagons â also continued to hold
out against the repeated attacks of the
Boers.
"By this time ' Lord Methuen was
wounded and the casualties were exceed
ingly heavy among his men. The am
munition was mostly expended, and the
surrender was made at about 9:30 in the
morning.
"The party In the kraal still held out
and did not give in until two guns and a
pompom were brought to b^ar upon
them at about 10 o'clock, making their
â¢position untenable.
| "It is confirmed that most of the Boers
tcore our khaki uniforms. Many also
wore our badges. Even at close quarters
they could not be distinguished from our
men.
"It is clear- the infantry fought well
and the artillery kept up the traditions of
their regiment. In addition to the forty
members of the Cape police already men

Discussion of the subject* has brought out a- differ-"
ene'e of opinion concerning the act" which constitutes
the election "of a- President. Some authorities hold
that the election . is consummated on the : day when
the electoral, colleges; of the "different States meet' in.
the State capitals and cast- their, ballots. Other au
thorities say a ; President^ is not elected until the ,ba}- â¢

should die during that period, who would : succeed"
-The- constitution 'provides that a Vice President
may succeed an actual President, and Congress has
by act provided for the further -succession" of mem
bers of the Cabinet in case the Vice President die;
but there is no provision for the successor of a! Pres
ident-elect;-and consequently, should such a contin
gency happen, there might arise a very bad' tangle to
unravelin the midst of a partisan 1 excitement. ' â¢ â¢ '
DESPITE the vigor with which the adoption -
of a constitutional amendment providing for
. " the election . of United States Senators by^
direct. vote of the people has been urged, the, opinion
prevails in Washington that it. will be preceded by an-"
other, even if it be adopted at all. The prospects are
that the 'sixteenth amendment, will, be that proposed
by Senator Hoar, conferring upon Congress power to
provide for the Presidential succession in the event
of the death of the President-elect. between the date,
of his election and the following March 4.

Despite the aggressive operations of the. Boers, the
British ~ mine-owners are busily at work getting the
gold out of the Transvaal mines. Over 1300 stamps
are now in operation, and others will be started as
soon as labor can be obtained. Thus, if the Boers
get their independence the British will have the. sat

Commander H. B. Mansfield, at present In charge of th*

of having more years to his credit for sea service than vany

case of Commander j; D. J. Kelley. recently retired because of

The naval expenditures of seven principal countries during
1D00 is given in a recent Parliamentary return as follows:
Schickau at Elbing. Normand at Havre and Thornycroft
and Yarrow are undoubtedly the most " successful builders of
destroyers and torpedo-boats. The record of the latter firm ia
particularly phenomenal in that it has built eight destroyer
for Japan during the past three years, all of which exceeded
the contract speed of 30 knots. They were tried with Ioad3 of
forty tons in a continuous run of three hours, and ranged In
speeds from 31.08 up to 31.38 knots. ... .-..- â¢- Â¦- -
The Russian Navy Department is gradually dispensing
with foreigners hitherto employed in the dockyards. At one
time foreign naval constructors, engineers and shipwrightsâ
chiefly Britishâ were so plentiful in the yards that the sjji?s
built were practically constructed by foreigners. Most^f
these have now been eliminated, and the Government Is com
pelling private establishments and companies to dispense witn
the service of foreigners. Three British engineers in the em
ploy of the Odessa Trading Company' for twenty-five years
have received notice to quit unless they chose to become citi
zens of Â¦ Russia. > ' *

'.-. British shipbuilders have experienced the same difficulties
in turning' out naval vessels in. contract time' as the builders
in the United. States. In the. case of torpedo-boat-destroyers
twelve" of these I crafts," built , between July. 1S96. and March.
1899, were still on ; the contra9tors' hands on March 31, last
year. ; Four, of '', these vessels were . from fifty-three to . forty
two'months behind contract date of delivery, "and ; the aggre
gate penalties amounted to. J434.600. On four boats $12,500 was
deducted, owing to failure to make contract speed. .Eight bat

"to six months behind contract delivery, upon which only nom

Under the heading, "Gratuities for Special : Services," the
appropriation account of the r British - Navy . for 1900-1901 con
tains-some interesting items.- There is a gratuity of 19s 2d to
"Chinese soldiers; 9s 7d as reward; for arresting a Chinese
thief; Â£3 143 as, expert fee for examining picture at an omcial
residence at Sheerness; and Â£5 reward to night watchman at
Smyrna for arresting the murderer of a seaman. To A. Beas
zina^a reward of Â£1 was given for rescuing i a naval officer
from drowning, while the gratuities /for the recovery of the
. body : of a naval Â¦ officer ; footed ; up Â£5 10s ,10d. The great
difference tin. the rewards -in the last two casesâ Â£1 to rescue
an officer; from â¢ drowning and Â¦ Â£5 :10s lOd for recovering;' an
other, omcer.'s bodyâ is riot calculated to stimulate life-saving.
OriUhe other haridrit is possible that the officer saved from
drowning was priced very low either on account of being con
sidered of little use to the service or that he was of an infe
rior grade, while the , recovered body may have been that of
an officer 'of high rank. â¢.,' . .
A new turbine torpedo-boat-destroyer, named Velox, is
building at Hawthorn and. Leslie's, yard, Wallsend-on-Tyne.
It is 210 feet by 21 feet, and is calculated to make the same

located at Hamilton. Bermuda, has been in use about twenty

MRS. BEATRICE NEWELL OP NEW YORK AND MICHIGAN. WHOSE
TRUNKS ARE FILLET* WITH GOWNS 'THAT HAVE TAXED THE
Â¦ WITS OP THE MODISTES OF A-ARIS. . . ;
IT is seldom that business is as featureless as at
present. All over the country the. conditions
. are decidedly humdrum. Barring the strike in
.Boston the week passed with hardly a feature worth
mentioning. The strike, singularly -enough, pro
duced no marked falling off in the city's trade,' as
the bank clearings showed a loss of only 2.4 per cent,
as compared with the corresponding week last year.
A second strike, however, is announced for to-day
at the Fall River textile mills, so. whatever labor
troubles are visible at present are centered in Massa
chusetts^ Outride of that State everything seems to
be going along serenely. The only other city of any
consequence in the country to show a decrease in
the bank clearings was New York, which fell off 7
per cent from last year, and most of the other large
.cities exhibited heavier gains than of late. The net
result of the week all over the country was a loss of
0.5 per cent, which is trivial. The week's failures
w^re 232, against 209 last year, but none of them
â¢were important.
The weather throughout the country improved last
'week, and.no interruption to trade or transportation
was reported by any section. The winter wheat belt
was visited by copious rains except Kansas, which
_.got only partial showers. These rains completely
reversed the outlook for the wheat crop, which was
beginning to worry the country somewhat, and it
'now looks about as favorable as it usually does at
this time of the year.' The Government issued its
regular report, and as it showed 23 per cent of last
3-ear's crop still in the hands of the farmers, this,
â¢coupled with the rains, weakened the, wheat market
at Chicago. The San Francisco market, which gen
erally declines and advances with Chicago, held up
l<ftter than the governing market, as the freight
â¢ market here is lower, owing to the large supply of
deepwater tonnage, and wheat, of course, gets the
.â¢btvnefit of the decline. . .
-.The g-rcat staples showed iittle change and price
â¢Variations were remarkably few and narrow. Pro
visions, .groceries, hides; wool, cotton, boots and
â¢shoes, steel and iron, and, in fact, the whole line of
staples, ran along without the ripple of a disturb
ance. Wall street, too, was quiet, and had plenty of
time to guess over; the meaning, of the large trans
jfars. of gold from -New York 4o San Francisco
through the Government treasury.
i ;As far as San Francisco is concerned the outlook
was never more briiliant, even in the old gold days.
Th'e city's, population is increasing with such rapidity
as to be perceptible to the dullest observer. On
ev<:ry side iall buildings are going up, new resi
dences arc being built all over town, labor is in de
'marid, and the' streets are full of, people. He who
; .asccnds to the top'of sny of our hills and looks over
the town is surprised at the quantity of new lumber
he sees,, from one end of the town to the other. The
export business of the port is also large, and freight
( room to many Pacific points is hard to procure. We
Â«em to have been suddenly galvanized into remark
able activity in all sorts of directions. The country,
m too, is fetling the quickening effects of the new
business -and interior 'banks and real estate agents
are reporting the best demand for farming lands for
many years. Altogether the State is apparently en
joying one of those periods of rapid progress so
often seen in the Western States, but which, up to
a year or so ago, seemed to have avoided California.
If this continues for' several years more the census
of 1910 will show a good many surprises.
THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS CON
DITION.
- Such . is the choice now > before the demoralized
Democrats of Congress. "It is not to be wondered at
that they, wait and postpone the election of <;a chair
man of the- campaign committee , in the hope that
something will turn up. .. :."â¢â¢- . ... ;
Hardly anything in the present political situation
shows the demoralization of the Democratic party
more strikingly Â¦ than this wavering of -the elected
representatives of the parly in approaching the task
of selecting a chairman of the Congressional Cam
paign Commitee. For years past the spellbinders and
the organs, of the party have been denouncing pluto
crats and plutocratic corruption, and now their rep
resentatives think of choosing Clark of Montana to
lead them in the fight this fall. . Even the most im
pudent of agitators could hardly be expected to sfio'ut
against . mcriey and bribery when lie had to go into
the field with Clark conspicuous as his leader and
paymaster. Â¦> ... ' . - .[,
Â¦Gorman, is not so "raw" a leader as Clark would
be. In fact\he'is not raw at all. Hardly any man
now. living has' so wide a knowledge of -American
politics," and few know better how to. work all the
wires that set -political machinery in motion.-, Able
as he is, however,- he is conspicuously lacking in ca
pacity-to take. broad views of public sentiment. He
can handle, Washington politics as astutely as any
one, but national politics is beyond him. -His limita
tions were clearly revealed when he split his, party
for the sake of making "a fight; against Cleveland.
Should he be chosen for. the chairmanship of the
Â¦Congressional; Campaign Committee his party would
go into the contest under a discredited leadership.-
Gorman has no barrel and precious few political
principles. He was elected to the Senate on a free
trade platform and then betrayed his party. He de
clared'himself a supporter of the gold standard and
then supported Bryan. . To. him more than to any
other. single^ man .was due the wreck of the Cleveland
administration, and yet. he now comes forward as a
leader in. the movement to overthrow Bryan and re
organize the party on a Cleveland basis.
Richardson is out of the. fight.- J Clark of Montana
will doubtless stay in if. he can perceive any chance
to win. ; His selection- for the:place could mean noth
ing more than that*'" Democrats are eager to tap. a
.barrel:^^ His executive ' bu'sipess;: ability, is unques
tioned, but his political "leade^nip would mean noth
ing to anybody outside of those who shared in the
distribution of the coin. ">"'
Richardson, Clark and Gorman: ' That is a_ famous
combinatidn.?; Any statesmen or 'politicians who
could as readily. accept the' lead- of one of these men
as of another are certainly very impartial in matters
of politics. Richardson is a free silver man and a
free trader. Gorman is a gold standard man and a
protectionist. It was he who managed the Wilson
tariff bill to such an extent that the author could not
recognize it, and Cleveland refused either to sign it
or to veto it. Clark of -Montana, has no politics at all
and entered the Senate-mainly". for the philanthropic
purpose of putting a large amount of money into cir
culation thrqugh the medium of the Legislature.
FROM the discussion .going on at Washington.
concerning : the ; selection of a .chairman of the
.. ; Democratic' Congressional ; . Campaign r Com
"mittee .the country, can learn Something of 'the 'senti
ments which animate the representatives of the party.
The first mah T spoken 'of :fbr the; position was â¢ Rich
ardson of^Tennessee,- but he 'declined. Then it was
suggested that- Senator: Clark of Â¦ M ontana . be'ehosen,
and now; 'conies the report thati Gorman 'of; Maryland
is back in-.\Vashington'yaiting to -take his seat, in the
Senate' after .March 14 and "wilt probably get the office.

She was invited everywnere and feted

Miss-Anna Foster gave a luncheon in her
honor at San Rafael on Thursday and
Miss Redington gave an informal tea for
her on Saturday, and now she has sped

is, something about her black hair and

, for I the ; present,' as she had arranged,
â¢owing to the. sad loss that has come to
Major Crittenden, the relative .whose fam
ily Miss Robinson intended : to visit in
Kentucky. While on -his way home from
the Philippines, a. few days ago, Major
Crittenden received a telegram announc

â¢whom the father particularly idolized -and
was just placing at West Pojnt. where he
was bound to have graduated with high
est honors 'and known a' brilliant career,
â¢as he was unusually bright. Major Crit

who are telegraphing their sympathy as
best they can, although words seem so
inadequate to express one's true feeling

These young ; matrons have' a retinue
of .trunks filled with, gowns thathave
taxed the . wits of " Parisian modistes
to the utmost, but- have replaced many of
them with ; a large number of more artis

over anything that comes from across the
pond, ', while, had we.not seen the neatly,
embroidered tag inside the garment, j it
would never^have occured to us to go mad

wonderfully effective when happily' ar

The Call gives the warning plainly, that no man
may mistake it. Gage was elected to the Governor
ship only because of lepeated pledges that he had no
bargain with the' railroad bosses and because of re
peated assurances from the railroad officials that the
corporation was out df politics. Such pledges and
assurances were potent then, but they will be worth
less if repeated, next fall. They deceived the people
once and they, deceived the Republican . press, but
they cannot deceive the press nor the public any
more. The appearance of Herrin, a Democratic rail
road attorney, at Sacramento as an ally of Gage,
scheming and cajoling* to get Republican legislators
to disgrace themselves by electing Burns to the
United States Senate, has not been forgotten. The
people will not vote again for that combination. Re
publicans themselves will v not support it. The Re
publican press will not advocate it. The only -way;
then, by which the. party can be saved at the next
election is to defeat the schemes of the bosses to-re
nominate Gage. That is the?ssue of the day/
California Republicans are loyal to their party, to
its principles, traditions, policies and platforms.: That
loyalty will prevent them from submitting to boss
domination, or from permitting a Democratic rail
road tool, to dictate to Republican. conventions. If a
convention submit to the bosses the genuine Repub
licans of the State will refuse to recognize it as a
Republican convention. They will denounce it as a
boss convention and vote against its candidates. ; '
The issue, then, that confronts the. Republicans of
California is that of saving their party and of keep
ing California in the rank of Republican States.- Un-'
less the true men of the party take enough interest
in its welfare to defeat Herrin, Kelly, Crimmins and
Burns, even. though they combine with Democratic
bosses and throng the primaries with the rabble vote
which their henchmen control, the people of Califor
nia will defeat the party.
If the combined bosses could .riot carry the city
with a fairly strong man at the head of their ticket,
what is to be expected of an attempt to carry the
State under the leadership of Gage? â¢ ;
The lesson of the late city election in. San. Francisco
ought not to be overlooked by,' the Republicans of
the State. In that contest Herrin, -by the aid of a
combination of Democratic and Republican bosses,
carried the Republican primaries. They controlled
the party convention and dictated a ticket. The
bosses thought they had a "sure thing.". It was a
Republican year. The Democrats of the city were
demoralized and divided.. Everything promised" an
easy victory to the bosses. The result was just what
the Republican press of the city predicted. Thou
sands of genuine Republicans revolted against boss
domination and repudiated the ticket. Independent
voters scorned it. Not even the personal worth of
the leading candidate could save him from defeat.
At the polls the bosses were utterly routed. Herrin,
Kelly, Burns, Crimmins, Lynch, Burke and the whole
gang were beaten.
. Let there be no mistake about this matter... Herrin
is not working for Gage in the interests of Repub
licanism, nor in the interests of California: He is
seeking to renominate him because Gage has-- been
a pliant tool in the past and will be equally pliant in .
the future. Gage has distributed the offices of the
State among the henchmen of ;the bosses and has
even made official positions in. the normal schools
and the charitable institutions ; of the*State parts' of
the spoils of politics. He has been so openly and
shamelessly an ally of Herrin that he -has , not hesi
tated to endanger the success of > the Republican
party for, the sake of pleasing Herrin. ' He Hassan-,
tagonized his neighbors,- alienated the strongest ele
ments of the Republican press, excited the indigna.
tion of thousands of loyal Republicans and driven
the entire independent vote from the party by a ca
reer in office which from the opening -fight made to
elect the disgraced Bums to the' United./States Sen-
ate, down to this'time, has been scandalous and 'vi
cious. Herrin and Burns may, .well ; desire the re
election of such a man, but while they may renbrai
nate him, should the rank and file of the party neglect
their political duties, they can never re-elect him! '
WHILE the time for holding primaries and ;<
for ' taking steps toward making nomiria- '
lions for 'the approaching State election ; is
still a long -way off, it- behooves the Republicans . of-
California to give heed to the efforts, now being
made by Herrin and. Burns to get control of the
party machinery, and dominate the State Convention.
It. is a part of the. scheme. to renominate Gage, .and;
that means the defeat of the party in the contest.for
the Governorship and the weakening of the whole â¢
State ticket/- It is clear, therefore, that in the inter- .
ests of Republicanism as well as in the interests , of
California the stanch 2nd loyal . Republicans of the
State should at once organize ; for the purpose of
saving, the party from boss domination. , ' . 'Â¦Â¦;Â¦ ,

Such {contingencies t as those supposed ; are, improb- â¢
able," and yet to statesmen at Washington it appears '
important they, should be guarded against. It is quite
possible they mighty give rise to serious complica
tions. Thus one' authority says: "If the President
and Vice. President electedon the second Wednesday
in February should both meet with a permanent dis
ablement or, should die. before the following March 4
there would be nobody tojnatigurate. cln that event
the Secretary of State of the outgoing administration '
would by the terms of the succession act become act
ing I. csident until another. Chief Magistrate' should
be elected. The functionary thus clothed with Presi
dential power might â¢ belong to the party that had,,
been voted out of office,' and the consequence would :
be .the "continuance in -executive control of the Gov- .
erriment for ajfullvterm of four years of a political
party that had been .'repudiated by the people at the,
polls."i â¢/Â¦.;;Â¦;''''Â¦â¢â¢'. ''â¢''' '- 'Â¦"Â¦â¢' ; 
â¢ These considerations are not new. They have been '
discussed in an.academ1c way.for a'long time, but the
third assassination Jofja President has given the dis

In < July. They, are all famous in Italy and I
am sure will score heavily with local theater
goers. The tenor robusto Is Venerandl. He
has a marvelous voice and is deemed the great
est - Othello Mn : Italy. He Is the only man I
ever met -who could sing VDe Suellaplerre"
in the 'key In* which it was written. /Our lyric
tenor Is Genarlo, and he has a beautiful voice.
Our dramatic soprano will be Inw de Frate,
who has sung the last three years at La Scala.
She is as famous â¢ outside of Italy as in her
native country. Mme. 'Trombon is our lyric
soprano. She is only 24 years of age, but
has already made a : marvelous success. The
other members of the company are equally as
clever. â¢ I The only new opera I heard In Italy
was "La Tosca,". which will be produced at
the Tivoll this season. â¢ Â¦ '

"Got two- whole "weeks; I'll make the trip
in ten days and save $1500. Just watch the
Inchcape Bock,'.', replied the skipper.
When the Inchcape Rock reached Portland,
six weeks later. 40 shilling charters were tra
ditions of the past. Word was received here
yesterday "that th*- Inchcape Rock had been
chartered at 26 .shillings. The difference to
her owners is Just $7S>00.
The captain of,' the British ship Inchcape
Rock, recently arrived at Portland, saved hie
owners $1500 by sailing his ship from San
Diego to the Oregon port Instead of taking a
towboat. This economy cost his owners $7900.

ARRIVED.
This morning will be devoted to the re
moval of the wild beasts in specially de
vised cages, put . upon selected electric
cars, to the new and spacious- Chutes at
Tenth avenue I and Fulton street. The
route to be taken will be along Page,
Devisadero and Sacramento streets.
The only living. object that seemed at
all- collected was. the "long-eared owl,"
which merely blinked the other eye, while
a talkative and skeptical cockatoo, look
ing at the tearful crockodile,
out "Buncomb!"
'"Weyler, the alligator," joined his con
freres in the glums, and the crockodiles
shed more copious tears than usual, and
as .the mopes are as catching as the
measles the dejection spread even to the
"merry-go-round," which, on this occa
sion went sadly round. In- line with the
depressed family were Mr. Joe Congo,
Mrs. Sally. Congo and their dear, sweet,
chubby offspring',- Johanna, who looked as
if she had been fitted out at a rummage
sale. â¢ --. . . %- .
Even the spider monkey, christened
Robert Fitzsimmons by .Henry Bush,
vowed that though he was a spider there
were no webs on him and he trusted that
in his quarters im the new Chutes by the
Golden Gate Park -he might be accommo
dated with exclusive apartments in view
of his decided antipathy to mixing with
the orang-outang and the "dog-faced
baboon," though the . latter looked al
most splrltuelle. Sadness makes won
drous changes, even in a "dog-faced'
baboon."
The whole scene was pathetic.
Â¦ / Â¦ â¢ . .,"â¢>Â¦â¢â¢
Yesterday was -moving day at the
Chutes, and the Inhabitants, In spite of
peremptory orders from Manager Edward
Levy, opposed the eviction. Nevertheless
sawdust carpets were taken up and iron
upholstery, was â¢ removed, and such a

seen before In -7 the Panhandle district.
While the band -played such airs as "The
Heart Bowed Down," "Good-by, Sweet
heart, ' Good-by". and "There's ' One
More River- to: Cross,"- so appropriate
to the occasion, Young Nero and Wal
lace,, the great lions, lost all con
trol of themselves and ,wept the
the weep of puny cubs. Princess, the ele
phant, so dear to the Infants, . packed Us
trunk time and time again in bags ' of
peanuts in the hope thereby to assuage
its emotion. The laughing hyena lost its
merry ha ha in contemplation of a change
of abode, and the python recoiled against
the disturbance which threatened it. The
poor little kinkee jou, or night monkey,
so named because of , Its natural disposi
tion to sleep all. day and keep awake all
night, forgot its detail and, keeping very
much awake, bathed in its own tears and
the warm spring sun. " :-

HAIR NATTTBALI.Y ABTJND^Niri
When It Is Free of Dandruff It Grows
vLuxurlantly.
Hair preparations and dandruff cures
as a rule are sticky or Irritating: affairs
that do no earthly good. Hair, when not
diseased. ' grows naturally / luxuriantly.
Dandruff is the cause of nine-tenths Â¦ ot
all hair' trouble,- and dandruff is caused
by a germ. The only way to cure dan-
druff Is to kill the germ; and, so far, the
only hair preparation that will positively
destroy tne germ Is Newbro's Herpicidp â
absolutely harmless; free from grease,
sediment, dye matter or dangerous drugs.
It allays itching instantly; makes hair
glessy and soft, as- silk. "Destroy the
cause, you remove the effect"â dandruff.

Grant and Chet Smith won the Davis
cups for the third consecutive -time yes
terday in the California Tennis Club
courts. The winners now lead in the race,
having their names inscribed four, times.
One more victory will give them the cups
permanently. They met Collier and Crow
ell, their nearest opponents in the ruce,
and with a slight handicap won. The
final between these two teams was ona of
the closest and most stubbornly contested
matches ever seen on the local courts.
The handicap was "owe half fifteen," and
the score in favor of Smith and Smitn
was 6-2, 10-12, 6-4. Collier and Crow ell
were at their best and handled the loos
of the victors in clever " style. - Chet
Smith's lobbing was excellent, while tne
serving and smashing of his brother was
St ln n tne first set Collier and Cro^ell, a3
usual, were rather slow in starting and
their opponents won easily. In the sec
ond set the Smith brothers had a^good
lead of 4-2. and looked to have the match
well in hand, but their opponents braced
and took the next three games. From
this point on Collier and Crowell were
constantly in the lead, finally winning
12-10. The match was to have been a
five-set one, but the a Â¦ contestant^ , who
were exceedingly tired, decided to make
lt I t n W ?h O e U nnÂ°il t L r rthe winner^ , took the
first two games, but the next three went
to Collier and Crowell. At this â¢ Point tne
brothers put more speed into their strokes
and took the next- three games. Grant
Smith put an end to , the struggle by. a
serve which Collier was unable to return.
It was probably the best match a tour
nament of this kind has brought out.

there will come a time when there will

cret and only a few. close friends know
he possesses it. _ -' .
"Jf'or some time bacteriologists have
known that the delicate flavor of Havana
tobacco was due to certain bacillus,"
said Secretary Prltchard of the Health
Department, "but nobody thought of
cultivating it and applying it to Ameri
can-grown tobacco. The idea struck a
Chicago man a year or two ago, and he
began experimenting. He finally dis
covered a means of growing the bacillus
and is now cultivating it on a large
scale. He takes the best grades of Amer
ican tobacco and covers the leafs with
the cultured microbes. The result is said
to be a production of tobacco as finely
flavored as the best imported Havana.
He is making cigars of the improved to
bacco and selllng.them as Havana Impor

The n*v. Dr. Isidore Myers delivered
another cf his Bunday special discourses
at the Bush'Blrect Synagogue last even
ing before a large congregation.
The subject chosen by the doctor was
"The Turkish Messiah," In which tho life
and character of Shabattal Zevi, who was
born in Smyrna, was vividly portrayed.
Shabattai was profound in the teachings
of the Kabbalah and his magnetism and
esthetic life attracted many followers,
who reread his fame far and wide. It
tias a period of Messianic prophecies and
the people were expecting the millen
nium and the restoration of the Jews to
PaJestine, which it was said would occur
in -Hie .year; J6G6. Rbabattai. though averse
td married 4ife, ultimately wedded a beau
tiful Polish maiden, and she, with the aid
of her beauty and her rare charms, won
- for Shabattai many followers and in
turn he made some kings. He repaired to
Constantinople, where he was arrested as
a rebel and to save himself and his wife
embraced the faith of Mahomet.
Graphically and with great power the
doctor pictured the fanaticism of the
period In which Shabattai held sway. He
told of the excesses, of the length the
people went who believed fn his power of
the dread persecution which was threat

prison, when, even then, there were those
who believed in him. despite the fact that

r NEW YORK, March , 16. â Bellamy
Storrer, United States Minister to' Spain;
arrived to-day on the American line
steamship St> Louis from Southampton.
Storrer was /surprised to learn that a
rumor had â¢ been circulated \ that he had
been recalled from his' post, and emphat
ically denied that there was the slightest
foundation for such a report. 'Said tie:
I have 'no idea how such a rumor could have
been started.; I have simply come home on
leave -of absence : for ninety days because ai
this time there ia.no urgency for W presena
in Madrid. It is, not true that there ha* been
a hitch in the negotiations of the treaty with
Spain and on the contrary they have progressed
most favorably and thsre Is absolutely no ob
stacle ! in i view to the successful accomplish
ment of the treaty. , I may say, Indeed, that
the most important provisions or the tÂ« al y
have already been fully agreed upon. So far
as the question of. the rights of Spanish prop
erty owners in Porto Klco Is concerned, the
Government at Madrid Is fully satisfied. The
negotiations of the treaty have been some
what prolonged, .not on account of any re
luctance on the part of the Spanish . Govern
ment, but merely because every condition ana
I may say every phrase in the document must
first be presented to the council of state lax
review and approval. . . . â¢ .
Owing to the approaching accession of the
youn* King the late Ministry of , Sagasta was
In effect simply a provisional one, and as thu
final ratification had to be left to the new
Ministry an opportunity was afforded me to
apply for a short leave of absence. I expect
to return to my post early In June. My rela
tions with the Spanish Government and .with
ofllclals of all classes have, been of the most
pleasant character, and - on all . hands I have
boen the recipient of the moat oourteous comld.

Michael Bolan wiih one of the Americans
whose Imprisonment was alleged to have
been illegal ami an outrage.
Certain American citizens here have
signed and forwarded a statement to the
Secretary of State at Washington in
which M. de Leon, the American Consul
at Guayaquil,' Is complimented on his
stand In the matter of the recent alleged
Impositions upon American contractors in
Ecuador on the part of the Ecuadorean
officials.
GUAYAQUIL. Ecuador, March . 16.â
News has been received here by
telegraph that a man named Ken
neay had been locked up in ' the
jail at Alausi, the same Â« place
where Michael Bolan of Springfield. Ohio,
was formerly imprisoned. Kennedy is not
an employe of the Guayaquil and Quinto
Railroad, but an Englishman trading le
gally In I Alausi. He appears to be well
connected. It. Is believed here" that as a
result of Kennedy's imprisonment the
British Government will have to consider
the matter of affording ' protection to
British subjects in Ecuador.
The cruiser Philadelphia came to Guay
aquil to make an investigation of the alle
gations that American citizens had been
ill-treated in Ecuador. The Philadelphia
left the mouth of the river to-day. She
takes with her an American citizen named
Leonard Selzer, from Minnesota, who has
been in jail here without trial since July
10 last, on the charge of murder. As a
result of i efforts made in Selzer's behalf
before Consul de Leon, It was learned
that no evidence exists upon which he
could be condemned. He was therefore
released. Selzer was formerly a carpenter
in the United States navy.
De Leon will leave here for New York
next week. '
The college is located at Bryn Mawr,
about ten miles from this city. The fire
was caused by the upsetting of a lamp
in the room of one of the students. " It
got beyond. the control of the local fire
men and fire companies were sent from
Philadelphia.
The burned building was known as
Denbigi Hall and had accommodations for
200 students. The fire started on the sec
ond floor in the western end of the struc
ture. When the fire was discovered by
the young woman in whose apartment
the lamp was overturned, she immediate
ly rang the fire alarm and started to fight
the. flames. The alarm aroused all the
young women In the building, most of
whom were asleep, and when it was seen
that the flames were getting beyond their
control, they made their exit. Those who
occupied the first and second floors man
aged to save some of their effects, but
those occupying .the third* floor Baved
nothing. Denbig Hall was erected In 1890
at a cost of $190,000. ljoss on contents,
not including the personal effects of stu
dents, $35,000.
PHILADELPHIA, March 16.-One of
the dormitory buildings of Bryn Mawr
College, an institution for the higher edu
cation of young ladies, was burned to

CONGREGATION
About 2 o'clock yesterday morning a
mob of highbinders who had been attend
ing a banquet became involved in a quar
rel at the corner of Ross alley and Wash
ing-ton etreet. A number of blows were
struck, and the excitement reached such
a boisterous pitch that Downey and Mey
ers rushed to the scene. It required sev
eral minutes of hard fighting to quell
the disturbance and start the members of
the mob homeward.
Downey and Meyers turned and walked
back in the direction of Jackson street.
The mob was advancing toward Washing
ton street. The officers had taken but a
lew steps when a report of a pistol and
the whizz of a bullet past their heads
brought them to a halt. Turning, they
observed that one of the men who had
participated in the battle had drawn a re
volver and was shooting in their direc
tion. Three more shots followed in quick
succession and three more bullets sped by,
Just missing them.
The officers drew their revolvers and
Ftarted after the highbinders before the
last blaze had come from the would-be
murderer's pistol. They chased the mob
through the alley, down Washington to
Dupont and from there to Clay, where
the phooter ran Into a building and wSb

the local production.

traction this week. Mr. Britt, a well
known artist In the ring, makes his first

â¢umlng the role In which Terry McGowrn
another light of tho lightweight calendar,
made so much success last year. Chnrley
'Iteno will put on the doves with Jimmy
Britt.
* The Alcazar has an excellent thine in
the line of farce for the week's offering,
a translation from the French of Alexan
dre BlBson, "On and Off." It is the usual
v thlng, light Intrigue and amusing compli
cations,- but handled with exceptional in
genuity and sparkle. The farce has loBt
little in its translation, and Is the kind
of thing in which the Alcazar Company
is seen to best advantage.
A rural drama by a local playwright,
Mrs. Lillian Day Coleman, will probably
come next.
Melbourne McDowell will to-night begin
a starring season at the Grand Opera
house In a. Sardou repertoire, with "Cleo
patra" for the opening play. Mr. Mc-
Dowell's chief support will be Florence
Stone, who contributed so much to the
success of his last season here last year,
and who has had much additional experi
ence since then. She will be seen in the
name role, and Mr. McDowell, of course
as Marc Antony. The rest of the cast
will be in the hands of the Grand Opera
house stock company, and the scenic side
of things will, as usual, be very ade
quately handled by the Grand Opera
house management.
At the Columbia Theater to-night
Blanche Walsh will begin an engagement
limited to one week, during which time
she will appear in two fine productions
"La Madeleine" and "Janice Meredith."
She will open her engagement to-night
with Harry Dam's new emotional drama,
"La Madeleine," and will present it on
the succeeding five nights and Saturday
matinee. The actress Is said to have in
this piece a good vehicle for the display
of her emotional talents and her sup
porting company is advantageously cast
"Janice Meredith" will be presented on
Thursday afternoon at a special matinee
and on Sunday night.
Next Monday comes the big production
of Hall's Caine's play, "The Christian,"
with Edward Morgan in his original role
of John Storm. Elsie Leslie will be the
Glory Quayle of the cast.

Fanny, nice, Inimitable and clever, pre
sented a novel turn at the Orphcum last
evening. With the aid of a mlnlaturo
ptttge she gave some very clever imita
tions. Mlsa Alice Deach McComag, the
pianlet who assists her, was given a warm
welcome on her return to thia city. Les
Troubadour* Toulousians repeated the hit
they scored last week by rendering a
number of new selections. Kathleen Par
low, a child violinist, made her first ap
pearance, and waa fairly well received.
Paul Cinquevalli, the wonderful juggler,
added a number of difficult feats to his
repertoire. Thia remarkable man seems
to be able to do anything with his hands.
His comedy is pleasing. His assistant is
a clever actor, and helps materially.
Hedrix and Prescott do a fairly good
dancing turn. They have all the reels, Jig
steps and clogs at their, command and
ther go through their tarn- without a mis
take. The Silvers, illustrated song vocal
ists, were well received. Their songs are
new and their Illustrations abound in
color and feeling. The Six Blackbirds
gave a new version of "The Golf Links,"
and their act went with greater vim. The
three Dancing Dawsons open the pro
gramme. The biograph has a number of
good pictures.
in spite of its gruesome ending, "Na
than Hale," presented last night at the
California Theater by Howard Kyle, is
like to prove 'popular, to Judge by its re
ception by the large audience. The au
tnor, Clyde Fitch, succeeds cleverly , in
arousing sympathy and compelling admi
ration tor his hero, whose patriotic de
voirs consist of the somewhat unplctur
esque duties of a spy, and he has woven
a taking play about tne life of trie young
schoolmaster. Fact and fiction are close
ly intermingled therein, but the large out
lines of .Haie's iile are adhered to and
tne rest la Â¦ sufficiently plausible. Tne
piay shows the" usual gllD tecnnique of
the Fitch hand, tne easy invention and
neatness of bund, with tne characteristic
lack of tne serious note. The last act,
wliere Nathan Hale, condemned, is per
mitted the night beiore his death to see
his sweetheart, and the last farewell is
taken between tnem almost in silence,
is the most effective five minutes in the
play. The climax of the third act, where
Alice Adams, suddenly confronted with
Hale, denies his identity to his captors
to save his life, and her old servant, not
advised of the secret betrays him, is also
a very strong situation. The Hrst two
acts Â¦are given mostly over to dainty
comedy and two charming characters
there Introduced, Mistress Knowlton and
Angelica Knowlton, are missed from the
later acts, not to their advantage. Th<s
last act. where the real rope and real
apple 'tree of the hanging and other
raiher police-gazetty realism is intro
duced, is undeniably unpleasant in spite
of the beforo-mentioned artistic faroweil

The capture of General Methuen was
the most serious factor of the week from
the sentimental point of view, although
the suppression of thia news by the Gov

market. There is no question that the
Stock Exchange is now in a healthier

were dull and lower. Mines were dull at
only a slight decline on the week, but
their general range was from 10 to 15 per
cent below the high level of the early
part of the year. . ' W <

Ing service it was estimated ihat 2000 peo

Those who came out 1 of curiosity and ex

Mormon church something out of the or
dinary were disappointed. On-the-plat
form they saw rows - of. .fashionably
dressed women, endowed with good looks,
and lines . of . . stalwart and intellectual
men, types of sturdy Western civilization.
The antiquated organ at Â¦Â¦ Metropolitan
Temple was a source of â¢ considerable an
noyance- to Professor Stephens and ,. his
singers. .The instrument leaked air like a
broken-down -'bellowe'- arid. _the ,' leader.. 'of
the Mormon choir, announced that his
soloists could not possibly sing to its ac
companiment, but that the choir would
render numbers in the hope that the noise
of the escaping air might be drowned by
the volume of human voices. â¢'Â¦''.'Â¦'

that selections should be rendered at the

Daniel McCarthy- were locked up last
night and their names placed on the det
inue book, pending the investigation.
There -' were several people Â¦Â¦> who -wit
nessed l the occurrence, and 1 they .will be
called on to-day to see if they can Identi
fy either, of; the arrested men as the one
who is responsible- for the death.
So firmly -was it wedged in among the
network of braces and levers that it took
ten minutes to extricate it.': Â¦ it was taken
to the Morgue and a . preliminary exam
ination showed- a fractured skull, severe
lacerations of the face and body and frac
ture of both legs. '.
Policeman .Tracy was the, first officer
on the scene and with the assistance of
others removed the body from beneath
the car and carried it: to the sidewalk.. -
Tom Qulnn, the saloonkeeper, says that
Daniel McCarthy went . out of the saloon
at the same time as his brother and Ca
hill. 9 He does â not remember Cahill com
ing back and making the remark attrib
uted to him by McCarthy. In" the saloon
at the time tlie trouble started were three
other men â John Dunlay, Guy "Ward and
C. Gorman: These men are friends of
Cahill, according;to the latter's statement,
and it 'is possible that; one of them may
have been the man who the gripman says
ran from the corner and struck the fleeing
man down. The police propose to investi
gate thoroughly what part, if any; the
three took, in the trouble. /.
Three Other Men Were Near.
I was the gripman on car 10,' which ran over
a man at the intersection of Ninth andFol
som streets. My car was northbound and . as
it approached Folsom â¢ street J I saw two men
run out Â¦ from the northeast corner and cross
the track. One of them was evidently being
pursued by the other. The pursued man turned
at the crossing and ran back across the Ninth-
Btreet tracks. Just as he had cleared the
tracks in front of the car a third man rushed
out ftpm the northeast corner of the intersec
tion and dealt him a blow. He fell' back -di
rectly-under the moving car. I at once ap
plied the brakes Â¦ and stopped the car
live feet of the spot where he Had been struck,
but when we reached the body life was appar
ently extinct. One of the men who was pur
suing the victim ran down Ninth r street, while
the other started south on Folsom. Â¦ I did not
watch how far. they went, because my atten
tion was directed toward Â¦ extricating , the Â¦ body
from beneath the dummy. I think I would be
able to Â¦ recognize that man who delivered the
blow, but I am not . certain. ,
It is evident from the statements of
other witnesses that both principals in
the i affair â¢ are concealing their real . par
ticipation in it. J. Hudspeath, who lives
at 106 Ninth street, is the gripman on the
car which crushed out the life of Eugene
McCarthy. He'was taken to the Hall of
Justice and released upon depositing $50
cash bail, and while there made the fol
lowing statement: , * . .
Pursuing Men Ban Away.
Daniel' McCarthy asserts he : never left
the saloon until after he was informed
that his brother's body was beneath the
car. He said the first information he had
that his brother had met with injury was
when Cahill re-entered the saloon with
his coat oft and said:, v "I gave that fellow
what he was looking: for."
Cahill .said he never, left the northeast
corner of Folsom and- Ninth streets dur
ing the altercation, and hence could not
have been- the man that delivered the
blow which 'sent Eugene McCarthy to his
death. ' . . -
Both Cahill and Dan McCarthy . admit
that they were righting. This is corrobo
rated by Tom Qulnn, a- saloon-keeper at
1300 Foisom. street, where- the. trouble
originated. Quinn says he ordered the
men out of nls place and they all lett.
Several minutes afterward he heard that
Kugene McCarthy had been killed by a
street car. He that no blows wer%
struck In the tfiloon, but the three men
were on the verge of lighting when he
compelled them to go into the street.
As soon as'the iniormation of the fatal
row â¢ reached police . headquarters Detec
tives Crockett, Regan and O'Connell were
detailed to bring in Dan McCarthy and
Cahill. They had considerable difficulty
in locating their men. Cahill was found
in bed at his room at 1050 Howard street
and McCarthy at Ninth and Braunan
streets. When brought into the Central
station both showed marks of having
been engaged in . a right. McCarthy's
nose ' was , bruised Â» and swollen Â¦ and Ca
hlll's clothes were torn. Both were some
what under the influence of llQUor, Mc-
Carthy being the more intoxicated of the
two. They told diametrically opposite
Btories of the part they had taken in the
affair.. Cahill admitted that he had be
come involved in a right with Daniel Mc-
Carthy i outside of the saloon. He said
he managed to get away and went back
Into the place. The first he knew about
Eugene McCarthy, being hurt was when
the latter' s brother came into the saloon
and said: "If my brother dies, I will kill
you." ' i
Admit They Were Fighting.
'. Eugene McCarthy, a sober, Industrious
and well-behaved "young man of 26 year a,
and I who Â¦ for the j last seven, years has
been, a' driver of tire engine No.'7 on Six
teenth street, was killed last night about
8:30 o'clock by , a Ninth-street car. He
was the victim of a drunken row between
his dissolute brother, Daniel,- and a man
named John Cahill, â¢ a 'car-repairer em
ployetlby, the aouthern Facliic Company
in the" 'iwenty-eignth-street yards.
Exactly now .tAigene AicCartny was
knocKed -beneath the car' to be ground
and mangiea almost beyond human re
semblance coulu not be learned' from the
conflicting ' â¢ statements of the principals
concernea in the attair.. Both Daniel Mc-
Carthy ana Cahill deny -.that they;,were
responsible : for. the mow that 'sent the
viciim under the wheels of the fast-mov
ing car. The gripman of the car, J.
Hudspeath, says tnat -Eugene was ' run
ning, away trom one man . when another
rusned'.-up : to nim and struck Â¦ him. He
fell back on the tracks and before the
lever could be reversed and the brakes
applied the dummy had passed over the
boay, dragging it several feet.

Last of Iron Trades Unions
Decide to Settle All
Differences. â¢
The last of the unions connected with
the Iron Trades Council have settled their
differences with the employers, and the
members will return to work to-day, or
as soon as places can be found. When a
majority of the unions represented in the
Iron Trades Council voted to declare the
rtrike off and return to work, the Boiler
makers' and Iron Ship Builders' Union
and their subsidiary branch, the Helpers'
Union, held out.
On Wednesday a committee from the
Boilermakers' Union called upon Henry
T. Scott, and, after a long conference, it
was agreed that the men should work
ten hours per day as before. The. men
say an advance of 5 cents an hour, or
BO cents per day, was granted them.
Mr. Scott said, however, '.that lie
would not treat with the men as rep
resentatives of the union, but would treat
with them individually and employ as
many as he could find places for at those
rates.
Business Agent Gildea reported the mat
ter back to the union, and was instructed
to call upon Scott again on Friday. They
had a long conversation, but neither
would disclose the result or the terms of
the agreement. The bollermakers heard
from Gildea on Saturday night, and the
union then formally declared the strike
off.
Similar action was taken by the Boiler
makers' Helpers on Thursday night, and
a number of them went to work the fol
lowing aay. Both sides claim that neither
cave in and that the settlement is really
a compromise.
In all about 300 men are affected by this
action. Work has 01 late been piling up
in all the large shipyards, and full crews,
It is said, will be employed at once. The
men are jubilant at the ending of their
long struggle, and the increase in daily
pay.
