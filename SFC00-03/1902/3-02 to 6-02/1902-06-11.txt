THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.
The executive session of the council was
then held, with the result thatSaratoga
Springs, N. Y., was selected as the place
for holding: the next annual meeting on
the second Wednesday and Thursday in
July. 1903. There was a shadow fo a con
test for the honor of entertaining the
Nobles by^Dallas, Tex., but the Saratoga
contingent swept the council by a decisive
vote. The election for imperial officers
will take place to-day, at which time, ac
cording to custom. Imperial Deputy
Potentate Henry C. Alken of Omaha,
Nebr., will be elected imperial potentate.
SARATOGA WINS FIGHT.
The main feature of the morning Â¦was
the parade of the escort to the Imperial
potentate. The streets were crowded all
along the line of march and great enthu
siasm, was manifested. The unique cos
tumes of the Arabian and Egyptian
patrols, some of them of exceedingly ornate
pattern, won the admiration of the femi
nine contingent. At Golden Gate Hall,
where the council sessions are being held,
the visiting Nobles were officially wel
comed in behalf of San . Francisco by
Mayor Schmitz. Charles H. ! Murphy,
potentate of Islam Temple, the -well
known organization of this city, delivered
the fraternal welcome."

PROGRAMME FOR TO-DAY.
The ladies'- reception at the Lick was a
brilliant affair, In which thousands took
part during trie afternoon. It was an en
joyable occasion for all who attended and
Its success' reflects great . credit upon the
ladles of the committee whose painstak
ing efforts to please contributed so large
ly to render the visit of the Nobles and
their friends â¢ enjoyable. â¢ The Â¦ parade in
the evening , was : one of the most unique
ever seen here; and was witnessed by im
mense crowds. The rally at the Pavilion,
which attracted a' great ' throng, Â¦ was a
complete success in every detail.
M im <HE last belated pilgrim, who
* g ' strayed from, his caravan while
H crossing the hot' sands of the
E desert, made his appearance
-*X yesterday and there. was great
rejoicing and feasting In conse-.
<juence among the sons of the prophet.
The Shriners had rested and- were in "ex
cellent trim for the performance of the
obligations imposed upon them by their
hosts, which included a ready acquiescence
in the will of San Franciscans as to their
entertainment and the promotion of a dis
position to accept .uncomplainingly and
without reservation all the good cheer the
people had to offer them. That, they
were successful in both respects was evi
denced yesterday by the good will,
stanch fraternity and hearty. friendliness
that characterized the functions of the
day.
There was much to occupy the attention
of the visiting Nobles during the day. The
r-urade of the morning, the meeting of
the Imperial Council, the selection of
Saratoga. K. Y., for the meeting of the
council next year, the brilliant reception
by the iocal ladies at the Lick House, the
magnificent and novel pageant of last
ingkt. and the rally at the Pavilion fur
l-.ished a menu of social delights which
the most blase of the visitors found it dif-
Jicult to ignore. The general public, too,
vas determined to share In the pleasures
of the' day. as was attested by the thou
sands that thronged the streets and
crowded to the various receptions .at
temple headquarters. The venders of
Islamic badges plied a profitable trade
and those merchants who had Turkish
fezes to sell soon found their stock In
trade insufficient to satisfy the popular
aemand.

trains that recalled the days ;of the pio
neers. Four yokes of oxen plodded along,
drawing wagons that for , age and un
couthness evidenced that they were used
| in crossing the, plains when railroads were
a dream and not a reality. Seated In the
old 'wagons were Nobles who had ac
tually crossed the deserts to California
in '49. ' The members of Islam Temple,
garbed as cowboys and mounted on mus-Â»
tangs, dashed. back and forth, firing pis
tols and creating excitement. Members
of the United States cavalry stationed at
the Presidio, dressed In the fantastical
garb of Indians, with, faces .painted; as
though on the warpath, were also In line.
They made the faint-hearted shudder
Â¦with their hideous war cries and startled
the multitude with their daring riding.
At every stop the Indians would dismount
from their horses and the trained animals
would stand huddled together, unmindful
of .the noise their masters generated. War
dunces and powwows enlivened the pro
ceedings. ' One Indian would squat on the
1 ground and bea"t a. tomtom solo Â¦while his
tollow braves danced in glee around him.

START OF PARADE.
All along the line of march searchlights

Third arid Market streets night was turn
ed into day. Suspended from â¢ two tall
buildings was the motto "Es Selamu Al- V

ants of lights were strung from The Call
buildingto the Palace Hotel, a block dis-
Jant. The latter building also presented
a fine appearance with its many lights.
At . the foot of . Market street the Ferry

The scene last night was not unlike that
which residents and visitors witnessed

play was equal to that seen on 'the occa

5000 Nobles marched on Market
yells that sounded maniacal. The cow
boys would cut short their dancing by
making a dash past them, discharging
revolvers and adding realism to the scene.
Accompanying, these was a wagon train
containing a commissary wagon and
tumbled-down vehicles bearing signs that
read, "From Pike County to Hangtown,"
"Zem Zem Water," "California or Bust"
and other appropriate lines.
Then came a float that represented the
army in time of war. A score of soldiers
attired In overcoats were grouped out

were seated and standing. Arms were
'stacked and a campftre waa burning. Sus

DRILLING ON THE MARCH.
Forty members of El Jebel Temple,
comprising the drill corps, went through
difficult evolutions as they marched- Their
efforts were highly appreciated by the*
people that lined the sidewalks. After
them, came 100 members of the tribe at

wore a fez and carried a cane tied with
colored ribbons. In order came Abdallah
Temple, El Zagal Temple; El Zaribah
Temple, sixty strong, from Arizona; Isla

carried lights and canes. Many of the
temples had yells, which they gave in
hearty fashion.
Following the second division was a
float representing a Southern plantation.
Negroes dressed in the'r unique costumes
stood before an o!d cabin and sang songs.
A field of cotton was represented very
cleverly. Old mammies gazed at the
crowd through bowglasses and picka

PARADE OF MYSTIC SHRINERS WHICH PROVES TO BE THE
MOST BRILLIANT SPECTACLE EVER SEEN IN SAN FRANCISCO
PRICE FIVE CENTS. ..
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY,, JTJNE 1, 1902.The Supervisors hope to avoid any seri
ous complications by entering Into some
agreement with the United Railroads re
garding a right of way for the Geary
street road to the ferry.
It Is more than five blocks on Market
street from Kearny street, the terminus
of the Geary street road, to the ferry,
but when the United Railroads absorbed
the Sutter street system it was thought
at once that a way was open for the city
to extend the Geary street line to the
water front if it acquired that line. That
was by extending it along Kearny street
after converting it into an electric road
to Pine and down Tine to Market and
over the Market street lines to the ferry.
Now that It is known that the Sutter
street Railway Company retains Its right
of way to the ferry a different aspect la
put on the proposition of extending tha
Geary-street line to the water front. The
retention of the franchise from Sansomo
street to the ferry by the Slutter-street
Company Is looked upon as a shrewd
move on the part of Interested persons to
prevent- the extension of the Geary-street
line.
Two lines of street railways, operated under
different management, may be permitted to uso
the same street, but In no case must two lines
operated under different management occupy
and use the same street or tracks for the dis
tance of more than five blocks consecutively.
These franchises were granted in 1879
for a period of fifty years, and terminate
in 1929. - .-'*'â¢

. WASHINGTON, June 10.â In the ab
sence of any ofllcial advices on the sub
ject the officials here are in the dark as
to. the reasons for the hurried departure
of the -German -warships for Venezuela,
as reported in the St. Thomas dispatch.
Germany has a big claim .against Vene
zuelaâthat, of the Berlin Company, of
Discountâ for the non-performance of en
gagements which the Venezuelan Govern
ment-has undertaken in connection with
the great Venezuelan Railroad built by
the Government. The claim approximates
6,000,000 bolivars. One. inference, and it is
merely that, as, there is no official infor
mation upon which to base a statement,
is that Germany has sent her vessels to
La Guaira to enforce the payment of the
claim, as Venezuela has not attempted to
meet the? obligation. v The diplomatic cor
resppndeiice pf the State Department
shows that Germany has considered the
question" of coercion in connection with
the payment of the claim...

Court at Allegan of the charge of bribery
in connection with the Lake Michigan
water supply scandal. >He was granted a
change of venue, on the ground that "he
could not secure a fair trial in this city.'

funds. - .Â» ;,â¢ .â¢ . Â¦
Gardner, however, is lost sight of in the
scandal that his conviction unfolds. He
was the amahuensls of Mayor Ames, and
the prosecution sought to show that such
bribes as he accepted were taken with at
least the connivance of executive mem
bers of the city administration. Police
Chief Ames, brother of the Mayor, is now
under indictment -and "will toe - placed on
trial within a few: days.
The State's case rested upon the testi
mony of men who asserted that money
was regularly paid to Gardner, and that
he distributed It among the members of
the administration, the consideration be
ing immunity from police
not only of shark gaming establishments,
but of various other places of crime, in
cluding social evil resorts.. It was the
claim of the prosecution that a complete
system had been; perfected whereby the
victims of the -protected criminals were
persuaded to leave 'â¢ town after having
been victimized. It Js alleged. that Detec

of Newcastle will be nominated for Lieu

Brown of Erie will be the candidate for
Secretary of Internal Affairs.
Senator Quay expects to succeed Gen
eral Frank Reeder of Easton as chairman
of the Republican State Committee and
to conduct the campaign this fall. At
tcrney General John P. Elkin of Indiana
is still battling for the nomination for
Governor, but his most sanguine, ad
herents concede Pennypacker' s nomina-
HARRISBURG, Pa., June 10.â
Judge Samuel W. Pennypacker
of Philadelphia will likely be the
nominee for Governor of the Re-.
Several times during the committee
meeting Senator Quay, leader of the Pen
n> packer forces, and . Attorney General
Eikln, who was in personal command of
his adherents, shook their fingers ln each
other's face and threatened political re
prisals if each was not given fair treat
ment in the disposition of the contested
seats in the convention. State Chairman
Reeder accused Senator Quay of making
deliberate misstatements, and the Senator
irttantly replied that this was an~tnsult
which he resented. The Pennypacker.
forces had a decisive majority in the com
mittee, and United States Senator Pen
rose was named for temporary chairman.
Both the Pennypacker and Elkin dele-"
gates held caucuses to-night to agree
upon a plan of action. The Watres dele
gates attended the Pennypacker confer
ence. : Senator Penrose will be temporary
chairman of the convention and Congress
man Sibley of Franklin was slated for
permanent chairman.
The Pennypacker-Watres caucus was
attended by 206 delegates, 180 being neces
psry to control the convention.
â¢ A poll of the delegates this afternoon
showed that there exists an unexpected
bjtterness between the leaders of the rival
fatclons. Elkin, ho.wever, is pledged in
h!s speeches during the .campaign to stand
by. the ticket, and it is naturally expected
that his adherents will do likewise.
tlon. Elkin said to-night that he would
stay in the fight to the finish; and that
his name would be presented in the con
vention. Lieutenant Governor Watres of
Scranton practically took himself out of
the contest when his delegates partici
pated in to-night's caucus called by the
Pcnnypacker managers. Watres' name
also will go before the convention, and
the indications are that he will poll about
2"> of the 258 votes in the gathering. -> -

Mrs. Baker responded, thanking the
Mayor for the cordial welcome, and paid
a tribute to the worth of the Nativo
Daughters. She was followed by Mr. By
ington, who spoke at some length on the
v/ork that the Native Sons and Daughters
have commenced â that of preserving his
torical landmarks and collecting material
for a full history of the country.
~ The speechmaking was followed by vo
cal selections by Miss Etta O'Brien and
E. C. Boysen, after which icecream and
cakes were served. Dancing followed.
There was to have been a presentation
to Mrs. Baker, but It was decided to post
pone that until to-morrow night.
At the session yesterday for the first
time in ten years all the past grand presi
dents were present.
Xast evening there was a reception in
Native Sons' Hall in honor of the grand
officers and delegates. Owing to the pro
cession of the Shriners it was half-past 9
before the hall, which was decorated In
yhite and gold, with a curtain of green
leaves and popples for a background, be
gan to be filled. At that hour Mayor
Schmitz, accompanied by Grand President
Mrs. Baker and Grand President Lewis
FÂ» Byington of the Native Sons, appeared
on the stage, when the Mayor was Intro
duced by Mrs. Julia A. Steinbach of Alta
Parlor. He delivered a short address of
welcome to the Native Daughters, and
said he hoped that the session of the
Grand Parlor would continue to the end
ln that peaceful harmony which marked
the first day's session. He said that the
fair daughters of the Golden State can
prove an important factor in the develop
ment of the State and that the members
of the order will do all ln their power to
maintain . its supremacy and glory. He
said that earlier in the day he had given
the keys of the city to another organiza
tion, but that as the doors were wide open
the Native Daughters were also welcome
to enter and enjoy the freedom of the
metropolis by the sea.
In the afternoon the committee on
credentials presented its report ln favor
of seating all the delegates, but there was
objection to some of the delegates whose
credentials were presented and this led to
a discussion upon the right of these to be
admitted, which lasted until 6:30 o'clock,
and finally when a vote was taken- the
report was. adopted and the delegates
seated. - .
An adjournment was then taken until
this morning, when the committees will
be named, the reports of the grand officers
will be presented and If Is probable that
the nominations for grand officers will be
made. There are two offices for which
there will be a contestâ grand president
and grand- secretary. Miss Eliza D. Keith
the vice president, will be placed In nomi
nation for the highest office and It Is
stated that some one will be named in op
position to her. For the office of grand
secretary Miss Laura J. Frakes, the in
cumbent, will be placed in nomination and
her opponent will be Elizabeth F. Doug
lass of Alta Parlor.
Miss Mae B. Wllkin, past grand presi
dent; Miss Alice Ticoulet and Mrs. Julia
A. Steinbach were appointed the press
committee, after which the committee on
credentials, consisting of Mrs. H. M.
Greene of Buena Vista Parlor, Mrs, M.
Yates of Ema Crockett Parlor and Mrs.
Ada Landers of Ramona Parlor, was in
structed to report at the afternoon ses
sion. Each delegate was presented a
badge and a neat gold pin 40 fasten the
same. It consists of a circle of laurel
with a bar on- the top, on which are the
initials of the order, and from the bow
hangs a small star on which is engraved
"1902." The grand and- past grand officers
were also each presented such a memento.
The sixteenth annual session of the
Grand Parlor of the Native Daughters of
the Golden West opened yesterday morn
ing, in Native Sons' Hall and after the
opening ceremonies there was presented
to Grand . President Mrs. G. W. Baker
beautiful flowers, the offerings of Buena
Vista Parlor, of which she is a member,
and of personal friends. . ';..
â¢At a- meeting of the owners of the
threatened vineyards it was decided to pe
tition the County Board of Horticulture to
authorize . the burning over of all of the
waste breeding ground of the hoppers.
Fearing that such action might result in
damage for which they would be person
ally responsible, the board refused to act
and the farmers ore $hus left to carry out
their fight themselves. ' -^ j -*- â
BERKELEY, June 10.â In a report re
ceived to-day by Professor E. W. Hil
grard, head of the agricultural station at
the University of California, Warren T.
Clarke," the entomologist sent Into the
Roseville district to combat the threatened
niRgue of grasshoppers, says that the
pest Is growing to proportions which are
unmanageable and predicts a serious loss
to the agriculturists as a result. He fur
ther states that the danger is greatly in
creased by the refusal of the County
Board of Horticulture to take any-con
certed action toward checking the ad
vance of the devouring army of insects.
The breeding ground of the pest covers
some 3000 acres of. wast? lands, according
to Clarke's report, and the vast army of
hoppers is advancing 300 feet a day in the
direction of the vineyards. The crop value
of the threatened district Is estimated- at;
$150,008. Â¦ â¢ .â¢â¢*- â¢

The dispatch from Hermoslllo also
states that a band of 100 Yaquis held up
the stage which runs between Hermosillo
and Ures at El Gavilan, a small place
fifteen miles from Ures. The driver was
killed, but the one passenger, an Ameri
can, was left unharmed. The Indians
took the arms in possession of the driver
and the American and everything of
value, including the express aboard the
stage, but the mail sack, which had been
concealed, was left untouched. A party
of volunteer soldiers set out from Ures
and escorted the belated stage to that
town.
General Torres is encouraged by this
victory and is preparing to pursue the re
treating and demoralized band.
News of the victory was received with
rejoicing in Hermosillo.
The attack was led by 500 mounted men
of his command. The Yaquis made a de
termined stand, but the forces of General
Torres gained their position on the first
advance and the Indians began a des
perate fight to cut their way out at the
rear. It was here that the greater num
ber of Yaquis fell. They succtseded in
carrying off the majority of their wound
ed, retreating toward the Mazatan Moun
tains, in the direction of Nacori.
General Torres had been advised in de
tail of their position by loyal Yaqui
scouts, and advancing with all the forces
at his command succeeded ln completely
surrounding them.
The Yaquis had taken jap what they be
lieved to be an impregnable position at
Santa Rosa, a ranch in the foothills of
the Mazatan Mountains, thirty miles
south of Ures. They were strongly en
trenched behind a row of hills heavily
wooded with scrub oak, and were well
supplied with water and provisions. They
also had a good store of arms and am
munition.
TUCSON, Ariz., June 10.â A late dis
patch from the Hennosillo correspondent
of El Correo de Sonora says that a mes
senger has just arrived â¢ at Hermosillo
bringing the latest details of Sunday's
decisive battle between 2500 Mexican sol
diers and a force of Yaqui Indians esti
mated at 800 braves. Twenty-four Mexi
cans were killed, including several of
ficers, and more than 100 Yaquis were
slain. The Mexican army took over 200
prisoners, the majority of whom were
women and children left behind by the
retreating Yaquis. The latter left eighty
dead on the field.

An Offer to
Nevertheless the specific has been found
and people cured or recovering from theao
hitherto fatal diseases are in every ward
In this city. And the recoveries are not
the exception, but the rule, for nearly
nine-tenths of all cases within thirty
days turn toward recovery, and it Is thea
simply a question of care, diet and per-
sistency.
Recent recoveries include two druggists
and two city physicians, and many physi-
cians have prescribed the Pulton Cora-
pounds, and have, therefore, had their
previous opinions reversed. But to con-
vince those who bave not we have now to
say that we will give to any reputable
physician In this city, who has either
Bright's disease or diabetes, the treat-
ment for six weeks without charge. He
will by that time know he can recover.
The only consideration we ask ln . return
is that when he Is well on the road to re-
covery he will admit It and tell his broth-
er physicians whatjla doing it.
We will be glad to mall to those Inter-

of physicians in believing that chronic
Brlghfs disease and diabetes are curable,
for education and experience have kept

cure, one text book says: "Tou may aa

from politics," war vessels could be built
at such yards as cheaply as at private
yards, and certainly within the contract
price. He maintained that the Increased
cost of construction in Government yards,
on account of the eight-hour law, was
more than offset by the immense salaries
paid the management In private yards.
GOVERNMENT PROTECTED.
In his opinion the Government could be
protected from, excessive cost of ships by
the utilization of the advantages of Gov
ernment yards.
At the conclusion of Perkins' speech, the
committee amendment as to the building
of two each of the battleships, cruisers
and gunboats was agreed to.
An amendment offered by Mallory of
Florida, providing for a $100,000 fireproof
building at the Pensaeola Navyyard, was
adopted.
Without further debate- the bill was
passed.
The London dock charges bill was taken
up and after some minor amendments
had been agreed to Hale presented objec
tions to the measure. The fundamental
trouble with the bill, he said, was that
men who ought to know their own busi
ness should not make shipping contracts.
It was an ' attempt to legislate against
men making their own contracts. He be
lieved the lumber men who were forcing
this bill could take care of themselves.

House Committee Votes Against the
Proposition to Make Him a Lieu
tenant General.
WASHINGTON, June 10.â The House
Committee on Military Affairs to-day
voted against making a favorable report
on the bill which recently passed the Sen
ate, authorizing the advancement of the
senior major general of the army. General
Brooke,' to the rank of lieutenant general
and his retirement with that rank.
The. vote, which was 7 to 3, was not on
party lines. Members of the committee
said that the adverse action was due to
the course taken by the House against
the ' bill advancing Surgeon General
Sternberg, and also because of opposition
within the committee to retirements at
advanced grades.
Its unqualified approval of the Nicaragua route
for the Isthmian canal.
The first part of the telegram was
called out by the action of the Chamber
of Commerce, through President Newhall,
in telegraphing to Washington as follows:
"We believe the best solution of the navy yard
question will be reached by building: a new
drydock In San Francisco harbor, capable of
docking the largest warships, with facilities
for painting and cleaning and where. If large
repairs are necessary to be made, vessels can
be dismantled and taken to Mare Island for
permanent repairs, thereby maintaining the ex
tensive shops and improvements now existing.
There was great Interest in Vallejo yes
terday over the telegram from President
Newhall, and the secretary of the Cham
ber* of Commerce of Vallejo came to San
Francisco to inquire into the real attitude
of the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce. He interviewed men prominently
connected with the chamber and returned
to Vallejo to report.
Since the first dispatch was sent over
the signature of President Newhall, an
other has been sent to Senator Hale,
chairman of the Senate Committee on
Naval Affairs, and Senator Perkins, who
is a member of the same committee. In
the second dispatch President Newhall
expressed regret that there should be any
complications, and earnestly requested
that no commissioner should be appointed
to locate a new navy yard. The comple
tion of the drydock at "Mare Island as
soon as possible was also urged.

NEW YORK, June 10.â The information
called for by President Roosevelt about
the coal strike has been secured and will
soon' be presented to him in the form of
an official report by Carroll D. Wright,
United States Commissioner of Labor.
The report will touch at the root of
the difficulty and will explain the "real
causes" leading to the great industrial
conflict, which causes have been jealously
guarded by both sides. Wright will not
make any suggestions or recommenda
tions.
The Information sought was obtained in
two interviews, which occupied in all but
four hours. Monday night at the Man
hattan Hotel President Mitchell made a
presentment of the miners' controversy.
Late to-day in the office of the Delaware
and Hudson, President Oliphant of the
company, President Baer of the Philadel
phia and Reading Railroad and President
Thomas of the Erie Company discussed
the strike from the standpoint of the
operators.
"I have practically completed the official
investigation," said Commissioner Wright
to-night, "and will present my report as
quickly as possible to President Roosevelt.
1 have secured the information I desired
and was treated courteously by the rep
resentatives on both sides of the contro
versy. It will not be necessary for me to
go to the coal fields." )
Speaking of the prospect of a general
strike of the miners Commissioner Wright
expressed himself as follows:
"If the eoft, coal men who have signed
contracts should strike they would be
violating their agreement and thus put
their unions at a decided disadvantage
and forfeit the sympathy of the public
This action would put the unions on the
defensive in every arbitration that would
follow the outbreak. None of the strikers
thus far was bound by contracts "

SALONICA, Roumelia^ June 10.â The
Stroumauj, a newspaper published at
Kostendit, Bulgaria, says It has trans
pired that a secret congress of delegates
from Kostendit, Dubnitza and elsewhere
mat in Sofia at the end of March and ar
ranged for the disposition of the money
received as ransom for Ellen M. Stone,
the American missionary, and her com
panion, Madame Tsilka.
Karapeoff, alias Tchnerpeoff. the leader
of the brigands who captured the mission
aries, was among the delegates, who de
cided to send the bands into Macedonia
on a secret mission.
Among his achievements was the leader
ship cf the notorious "Hole-in-the-wall
panr" He was connected with "Butch"
Cassidy and the other notorious criminals
â¢who composed that organization in most
of the worst crimes of which they were
pullry. He left that company, however,
and began to operate on his own account.
Leaving the quarry, the escaped con
victs separated. Tracy and a convict
named Lent going- in the direction cf Par
ley's Canyon. They held up a man and
his wife who were driving in their direc
tion, and, taking their buggy, escaped
Into Colorado, whore they killed a young
ranchman with whom they quarreled.
After this crime, Tracy was captured by
Colorado officers and placed in Jail, but
escaped after beating three guards into
insensibility. He was retaken and kept
in custody for two weeks, when he again
escaped after almost killing a guard by
clubbing him on the head. Since his sec
ond escape nothing was heard of the man
until he became notorious by his crimes
in Oregon.
Suddenly Tracy drew a revolver from
his convict's jacket and covered the guard
â¢with the weapon. Commanding the guard
lo remove his clothing, and taking his
gun, Tracy donned the uniform of the
guard, and, with three other prisoners,
walked boldly av.-ay. They kept the guard
covered with a revolver until they passed
from view. A posse searched the coun
try, but none of the men was ever found.
SALT LAKE, Utah. June 10.â Harry
Tracy, who, with David Merrill, shot and
killed four men while escaping from the
State prison at Salem, Or., yesterday, has
6erved time in the Utaix penitentiary, but
escaped from custody with four other
criminals, none of whom have ever been
recaptured. He is well known to the po
lice of this city. In 1S97 Tracy was sen
tenced to a term of one year for burglary,
but remained In prison only two months.
While a member of the work gang which
was operated at the penitentiary, he held
up the guard at the point of a revolver,
and, with three others, got away.
The gang had been taken out as usual
that morning and put at work in a rock
quarry. Four of the convicts were under
the charge of Guard John Van Stetter,
and Tracy was one of the four. The guard
was armed with a. double-barreled shot
gun and remained at a distance from the
prisoners. Various devices were resorted
to by the prisoners to divert the attention
of the guard, but all were futile. Tracy's
shovel, however, finally was bent and Van
Stetter approached to assist in mending
It. The men stood side by side, too close
for the use of a long-barreled shotgun.

Tf '-rf jr ASHINGTON, June 10.âAn
\\ )\ / other of the big supply bills
Vk/vt/ of the Government was dis-
V V posed of by the Senate to-day,
the naval bill, carrying more
than $78,000,000, being passed. It Includes
provision for two first-class battleships,
two first-class armored cruisers and two
gunboats, but strikes out the House pro
vision that one of each shall be built
at Government yards.
When consideration was resumed on the
Isthmian canal question, Turner delivered
an extended argument in support of the
Nicaragua route. He maintained that the
new Panama Company could not pass a
clear title to the Panama Canal Com
pany's rights, franchises and property to
the United States, and that if this Govern
ment purchased it, it would be with all
Its incumbrances.
Soon after the Senate convened, Car
mack of Tennessee Introduced a resolution
directing the Committee on Civil Service
and Retrenchment to investigate the case
of Rebecca J. Taylor, a clerk in the War
Department, who was discharged for the
alleged reason of criticising the adminis
tration's Philippine policy in a communi
cation to the press. The committee was
directed to investigate the reasons for her
discharge. The resolution went over un
der the rules.
Consideration of the naval appropriation
bill was then resumed, the pending
amendment being that providing for the
construction of two first-class battleships,
two first-class armored cruisers and two
gunboats.
ARGUED BY PERKINS.
Perkins of California, a member of the
Committee on Naval Affairs, argued that
some of the vessels of the navy ought to
be constructed at Government yards and
he urged that the admirably equipped
Government yards ought to be utilized.
This policy, he said, was demanded by the
labor unions.
Platt of Connecticut asked if this was a
demand or a request on the part of the
labor unions.
"I meant that it Is a request," replied
Perkins. "They maintain tnat it is to the

SALEM, Or., June 10.â Tracy and Mer
rill, the convicts who yesterday killed
three gruards and a fellow prisoner and es
caped from the Oregon penitentiary, ara
still at larg-e. They were seen early this
morning at Gervais, eighteen miles north
of Salem, where they took possession of
& farmhouse and compelled the occupants
to supply them with breakfast. The fugi
tives rode through Gervais, but there
abandoned their horses after breakfast
and took to the woods on foot. Sheriff
Durbin of Marion County, with a posse
and bloodhounds, arrived at Gervais at
I o'clock this afternoon and started on ,
the traiL
The bloodhounds soon picked up the
trail of the escaped convicts and pressed
them so close that at 9 o'clock to-night
they ran into town, held up Dr. C. S.
White and Edward Dupuis, two business
men of Gervais, took the doctor's horse
buggy and drove away. The Sheriff's
posse, with bloodhounds, was only a
quarter of a mile behind. The convicts
ran Into a road which was fenced and
there abandoned the team and took to the
woods, through a large field half a mile
west of Gervais. The posse is close on
the trail and the fugitives are exhausted.
Their capture, it is believed, is a question
of only a short time.
During yesterday and last night the men
stayed close to Salem and shortly before
midnight passed through the center of
Salem, took a man's clothes from him,
stole another suit and then took two
horses out of a stable near town and
started northward. The officers in Salem
knew nothing of the presence in Salem of
the escaped convicts until this morning,
when J. W. Roberts informed them that
he had been stripped of his clothing near
his bouse in South Salem at 10 o'clock last
night by Tracy and Merrill and that they
threatened to kill him if he gave out the
ir formation before morning.
During the day several attempts were
made to start the hounds on the track
of the fugitives, but each time the scent
was lost. The hounds were taken to the
Roberts house, where Tracy and Merrill
changed clothing, and were put on the
scent frcm the clothing. They followed
it to the stable from which the horses
were stolen, but there it was lost.
All officers realize the desperate char
acter of Tracy and it is not likely he will
be taken without a battle.
It is known that they have friends In
Portland, and from their northerly course
it is supposed they are endeavoring to
reach that city.
Louis Butler, an ex-convict, was arrest
ed to-day on a charge of assisting Tracy
and Merrill to steal the horses from the
local stable.

CAJ,L BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, June 10.â That the
adoption of the Spooner substitute In
structing the President to negotiate for
the Panama canal instead of the passage
of the Hepburn bill means no canal legis
lation for^the present, session was mado
plain to-day by expressions of opinion by
prominent members of the House that the
lower branch would stick to its own canal
bill and that the matter would die in con
ference.
This is the view repeatedly expressed by
Senator Morgan and Senator Harris, who
have been leading the fight In the Senate
all winter, and it is known that the
friends of Nicaragua in the House are of
the same opinion.
Representative Hepburn, by whose
name the bill is known, is now out of the
city, but those who are familiar with his
views say that he would never yield if the
Spooner substitute comes over to the
House. Representative Mann of Illinois,
who has been an able lieutenant of Hep
burn in the House, said:
"It is a question of a canal or no canal
If the Senate should adopt what is known
as the Spooner substitute the House, which
passed the Hepburn bill with only two
dissenting: votes, would not yield. It Is a
desperate fight between legislation and no
legislation and I do not think that the
Senate fully appreciates the situation.
Nicaragua means certainty of completion.
Panama means uncertainty of beginning.
Nicaragua means a clear title and free
dom from scandal. Panama means legal
and diplomatic clouds and the possibility
of almost endless scandal."
It is pointed out by friends of Nicar
agua In the House that Senator Hanna in
his argument for Panama misrepresented
the attitude of the House by saying that
It passed the Hepburn bill before an offer
of the Panama Company was made. They
said that while this is strictly true so far
as a formal offer is concerned, the House
took action several days after the news
that the Panama Company had voted to
make an offer had become known.
If the advocates of the Spooner substi
tute are altogether sincere in their desire
for some canal, the friends of Nicaragua
inquire, why is it that all of the Senators
who for years have opposed any canal
across the isthmus are joining in their
support.

VALLE JO, Cal., June 1O.â
"While the Idea of aban
doning Mare Island
- jVavy Yard seems pre
posterous, sacrificing as it
would l(i25,OOO,OOO in Govern
ment property, "the situation
is so serious that prompt
and active measures should
be taken to . forestall the
plan, not only by Vallejo but
by California generally.*
It is a coincidence Worthy
of notice that, simultaneous
with the resolution intro
duced by Senator Hale, comes
the first news of the consoli
dation of Â¦ private shipbuild
er* throughout the country.
In other words, we will have
a shipbuilding trust as well
as the beef trust, coal trusts,
and other like combinations.
I firmly believe that the pri
vate contractors, realizing
that they have dangerous ri
vals in the first-class navy
yards of the. country, are de
termined to dispose of them,
and Mare Island is first on
the list. .
Senator Hale asks If a flrst
class * battleship has ever
been to Mare Island. Xoj
neither has there been the
necessity for sending one, as
the present dry dock could
not accommodate the Iowa
or Wisconsin; bnt the new
dry dock under course of
construction will be able.
Did Senntor Hale ask the
same qnestlon concerning?
the Xorfolfc or Portsmouth,
N. H., >*avy Yard? Had he,
the answer would be the
same as that In regard to
Mare Island, as no first-class
battleship has been at either
of those yards.
Perhaps he -will ask this
qnestion concerning: these
yards at the next session of
Congress. T understand that
an appropriation of $750,000
hms been made this year for
dredfetngr the approach to
Portsmouth yard. And ntill
the strongest point made
n&ralnst Marc Island is that
some dreds?insr Is necessary.
I would have absolutely no
fear of a comminslon com
posed of uncli men as Ad
mirals Miller, Glass, Kemp
or . Cof^blnn .or^ Captains
Cotton or fhelps, able
officers and sailors who
have spent years In and
about Mare Island and know
Its desirability' as a navy
ynrd, but I -would fear a com
mission appointed through
the influence of those hostile
to Mare Island.
I cannot understand the
notion of President IVevrball
of tbe San Francisco Cbnm>
her of Commerce in Indors
ing: Senator Hale'* resolu
tion. It appears certain to me
that the passage of the reso
lution would mean that Cali

ing with you like great strains of music.
Here you shall see the rolling waves of the
Paclflc. singing their lullabys in such divine
strains of harmony that the whistling winds
shall carry tt;e melody across the continent
and leave music in every one of your homes.
Here you shall see forests, aged and noble,
dating back into the dreamy past j and reach-
Ing out into the hopeful future, which shall flu
ycur souls with the <rrandness of nature and
awaken your thoughts of the mightiness of Him
whose power of omniflc speech created worlds.
Here you shall find climatic conditions where
Eunshine and shadow combine Jn peace, and
eongs are hushed and soothed In the lap of
comfort; no cold, no heat, but all one heavenly
ray of light and damp, making life one Joy,
and prosperity come out of cloud and sun
shine.
Here you shall find broad fields where every
thing of plant or flower or fruit or grain or
prat-s grows Into the fullness of the tropics,
and seeds in abundance ripen Into wealth
and where farming is an occupation leading
to the ease that lifts man into the place in the
social scale where the arts and sciences re
ligion, oratory, music and all that ennobles
mankind has an opportunity for growth.
Here commerce expands, energy grows life
enlarges, the noblest in man develops, and all
nature- enrobes herself in beauty, and the sDlr-
Itual within us reaches out and grows in touch
with the great Over-soul of all things
To this land of beauty and wealth and cheer
ful and honest hearts I welcome you. Again

as well, y
We welrome you with such pood cheer (as

of the West, and the palmy days of Palmyra
ana Thebes, and Carthage and Troy, shall
dwindle into nothingness under the royal com
niercial splendor of San Francisco.
Here you shall find the science of the stars,
the wonderful movement of the heavenly bod
ies studied in the Lick Observatory, which
gazes into abysmal space with the strongest
eye made by the hands of man.
Here you shall find a noble, intelligent and
active people, who by energy and enterprise
are laying the foundation of a wonderful em

You need rest from the trials of the Journey
and you enter the Temple of Islam, and there
expect not only friendly greeting, but repose
and rest (which you will not get), and I
heartily invite you and welcome you.
Life has its failures, its hopes, its Joys, its
cares and every mystic order holds within itself
the one purpose of bringing Its members into
that relationship which shall develop the high
est, the purest and noblest in jnnn. With that
object In view you have crossed deserts, as
cended mountains, traveled the plains, and af
ter miles of distance traversed by you, you now
stand upon the grandest oasis of all the world,

Shriners to the hospitality of the Western
metropolis, and Charles H. Murphy, po
tei'tate of Islam Temple extended to them
the right hand cf fellowship in the name
of their brethren of the local temple.
The opening of the council was an lm
preEsive event. The hall had been ao
propriately decorated with flowers, Amer
ican flags and emblems of the mystic or
der. Around the rails of the balcony were
ctrung streamers of bunting which hung
iii graceful folds. The stage was trans
formed into a very forest bower, with a
profusion of ferns, flowers, verdant foli
age and potted palms. Across the stage

SCENES OF DAT PARADE AND
OPENING OF IMPERIAL,
COUNCIL.
he had many friends in the assemblage to
greet him when he rose to speak. He
said in substance:
Members of the Imperial Council, Nobles and
ladies: It is indeed to be regretted that you
are not to hear Imperial Potentate Philip G.
Shaffer. I would that it were within my power
to reveal to you the emotions that at this mo
ment animate his bosom. I wish that some
more able speaker had been selected to respond
to the hearty words of welcome which we have
heard to-day. But when I am directed by the
Imperial potentate , Jt is not for me to reason
why, my duty is but ,to act.

gomery street to California, to Kearny, to
Market, to Stockton, to Post, to Powell,
to Sutter, thence to Golden Gate Hall,
where it was disbanded, and the Shriners
entered the hall to witness the opening
ceremony. All along the line of march
people crowded the sidewalks and the
windows and doorways of the stores to
witness the parade and to cheer the pil
grims on their way.
of June I witnessed great activity in all our
temples scattered through', this broad domain.
The caravans have- been- preparing for this
Western j Journey, which is the longest ever
undertaken in the annals of our organization.
The caravans on their long Journey paused. for
a time to enjoy the picturesque beauty of the
majestic peaks of the Rocky Mountains, the
pilgrims refreshed themselves in the great Salt
Lake and took their last stop before reach
ing this Western oasis to offer up their devo
tions amid the snows of the Sierra Nevadas.
The Journey of the caravans is completed and
the pilgrims are here to rest themselves be
neath the date and palm trees of the oasis of
Islam.
Assembled here are men from every State
in the Union and from the Dominion of Can
ada. Whether they come from New England,
the scene of the first civilization on this con
tinent, or from Dixie land or from the domain
of England's King, they are men of promi
nence in their home country. They are men
prominent in the social, political .and business
world.
In behalf of the Nobles of the Imperial Coun
cil and their ladies I wish to assure you that
we accept this welcome in the same hearty
spirit in which it is given. Some of us al
ready in times past . had the pleasure . of
enjoying your hospitality. One of the proudest
mementoes in my possession is a key to this
great city which was given to ma a year ago.
I desire to say to those who have not yet had
the pleasure of experiencing: the good fellow
ship of the people of this city that their hos
pitality will prove a revelation to you. It will
far exceed that" about which you have read
in the history of Arabia.
When Past Imperial Potentate Winsor
had concluded his response, Imperial Po
tentate Philip G. Shaffer announced that
the Imperial Council was about to com
mence its session and requested those
who were not representatives to with
draw. . ..'...Â¦ .
The formation of the parade was ei
fected on New Montgomery street, and
hither between the hours of 8 and 9
o'clock in the morning thronged the
Shriners, costumed in all the colors of
the spectrum. It is the custom for the
Arab patrols to act as escort to the Im
perial Council. The Shriners have, won
fame because of the splendor of their
costuming, but the Arab patrols in this
respect have certainly reached the limit
of perfection.
R. P. Hurlbut acted as grand marshal.
Immediately behind his staff rode a corps
of buglers from the Presidio. Then came
what in all probability was the flower of
the parade, the mounted ' patrol of Islam
Temple, consisting of twenty-four Shrin
ers clad in immaculate white and astride
ccal-black chargers. They were under
command of Captain George F. Neil and
attracted attention all along the line of
march. Thirty-three members of Islam
patrol marched on foot. They were
dressed in Arabic costumes. Between
the mounted patrol and the Shrin
ers on foot rode little Horace Logan, the
mascot of the patrol, mounted on a
prancing Shetland pony. Both Master Lo
gan and his miniature charger were deco
rated in appropriate style.
Following . the local delegation came
Arab patrols from temples in. all paxts
of the Union. Each patrol was arrayed
in a distinctive uniform, "and it would be
difficult to say with Justice which was the
most attractive. Ararat patrol, which
hails from Kansas City, was arrayed in
a, garb that showed all the colors of a
rainbow. They wore turbans of blue, gold
and purple, and their boleros were or
namented with applique work on royal
purple plush. All along the line they re
ceived applause both for their dress and
the precision with which they executed
maneuvers. They were commanded by
Captain C. H. Salinas, assisted by First
Lieutenant R. S. Emmert and Second
Lieutenant M. J. Gelhan.
El Malaikah patrol of Los Angeles, un
der command of Drill Master Percy Weld
ner and with "William Lcvet right guard
and Robert Wankewsky left guard, also
made a very- commendable appearnce
They had twenty-four in line.
Other patrols in line were: El Jebel of
Denver, headed by a band of sixty-five
pieces; Aladdin of Columbus, Ohio; Syria
of Pittsburg, Moolah of St. Louis and
Zuhrah of Minneapolis. Without a single
exception the patrols, with their Oriental
garbs ,. lively music and picturesque drill
ing, made splendid showings. The mem
bers of the Imperial Council rode in car
riages. ;
The course of the parade was up MontÂ«
intended as a display for the
enjoyment of the spectators so much
as it was designed to be an escort
to the officers and representatives of the
Imperial Council to their meeting place
in Golden Gate Hall. Nevertheless it wa3
a very picturesque spectacle, and one the
equal of which has been seldom if ever
before witnessed in this city.

the marching Shrlners. Suspended from
the center of the ceiling was an Immense

figures in the maneuvering in the most
surprising manner. Not once in twenty
minutes, of- steady drilling did they make

LADIES' COMMITTEE.
The ladies who contributed to the suc
cess of the reception were:
The reception-room was decorated in a
manner befitting this land of fruits and
roses. Flowers and foliage were suspend
ed from the walls, while in one corner
were arranged festoons and bouquets of
callas and poppies. Marguerites and fra
grant sweet peas added their beauty and
delicious fragrance to the scene, and to
/Ptill heighten the effect the room was
.^V-Ullantly lighted with electric lights,
i-very woman who attended was present
ed with a basket of flowers. This was
done in order to give the visitors an op-
Po r^ u "Â«y to become better acquainted
Â¦with California's floral charms.
The ladies of the reception committee
were all handsomely gowned. Some of
them wore the white fezes, which became
them admirably. During the afternoon
Bennett s orchestra discoursed lively mu
5ic. and a chorus of Chinese girls from
the mission surprised and delighted the
visitors by singing several songs in fine,
clear voices.
RICH DECORATIONS.
THE Mystic Shriners and their
wives were given an opportu
nity yesterday afternoon of
enjoying a treat of real,
hearty, -wholesouled Western
hospitality. The reception
which was tendered them at
the Lick House proved an
event eo delightful that the visitors
roust inevitably carry a happy recol
lection of it back to their homes in
the East. The reception was under the
management of the wives and daughters
and lady friends of the members of Islam
Temple, and they proved themselves ex
cellent entertainers.
Probably never in its history has the
great dining-room in the Lick House,
where the reception was held, been the
â¢scene of a more attractive spectacle.
Thousands of handsomely gowned women
and men thronged the room from 2 until
Â£1 o'clock. Women from the East met and
gTeeted their sisters from the sunny Dixie
land, and both the women from the East
and South extended the hand of good fel
lowship to the women of the West and
Middle West.
After the formal welcome
of the Shriners by Mayor Schmltz the
council went Into executive session, and
proceeded to transact routine business.
The selection of a meeting-place was the
most important subject discussed.
It was conceded last year, when the
Shriners met at Kansas City, that Sara
toga Springs would be the next city fol
lowing San Francisco to secure thÂ»
Shriner meeting. Saratoga Springs had a
pledged backing of 127 votes at Kansas
City, when ninety-eight was all that was
necessary to decide the matter. But when
the California delegates Went around
among the delegates praising up San
Francisco as a famous Western Mecca,
Saratoga lost hope. The delegation from
that city had little trouble to win its fight
yesterday, the only formidable competi
tor being Dallas, Texas. When the ques
tion was put to a vote the choice of the
council in favor of Saratoga was practi
cally unanimous.
The election of officers Is the event of
Importance on to-day's programme of the
Imperial Council. In accordance with the
custom which has been invariably fol
lowed by the Shrlners, Imperial Deputy
Potentate Henry C. Alkin of Omaha,
Neb., will be elected to succeed Philip C.
Shaffer in the offlce of imperial potentate.
And In accordance with the same custom
the other officers expect to be elected to
the next higher position In the following
order: Imperial deputy potentate, George
H. Green of Dallas, Texas; imperial chief
rabban, George I* Brown of Buffalo, N.
Y.; imperial assistant rabban, Henry A.
Collins of Toronto,- Canada; Imperial nigh
priest and prophet, Alva P. Clayton of St.
Joseph, Mo. .
" For the offlce of imperial oriental guide,
however, there will be a contest, if such it
may be called. The Shriners do not cam
paign nor seek election to office, but mere
ly await quietly for their brethren to elect
them if they see fit. There are thirty-one
representatives who are eligible to be
elected to this position, and it will not be
known until after the ballots are counted
which of the thirty-one has been chosen.
Imperial Treasurer William S. Brown of
Pittsburg, Pa., and Imperial Recorder
Benjamin W. Rowell of Lynn, Mass., will
undoubtedly be re-elected.
THE Imperial Council of Mys
tic Shrinera decided after a
brief, contest yesterday to
hold Its next meeting' at
Saratoga Springs, N. Y., on
the second Wednesday and
Thursday in July, 1303.

Probably the greatest sale that has been
conducted In San Francisco during the
past ten years is the sale now being car
ried" on at both Market and Post street
stores of Kohlberg, Strauss & Frohman.
During the past week the rush was so
great that they, were unable to handle ths
crowds. The doors were closed, only ad
mitting as many as could be comfortably
vraited upon. ,
The fact that the rush continued all
through the week and that many who
purchased on^?Monday returned to buy
again later in the week is ample proof
that the bargains offered were bona fide.
For next week's sale they have greatly
ir creased their facilities and have suc
ceeded in employing a large number of
extra clerks and can, consequently, Insure
better service than they were able to give
lust week.
Many people from the country were no
ticed during the sale and there is no doubt
but that they purchased enough supplies
to last them for several months in ad
vance. -" Â¦ . - ...

The chief thing in the; enjoyment of. the holiday
season is to rid the mind of carking cares and the
excitements and the worry of business. That free
dom can be obtained in the far off mountains, and
it can be obtained also at home. It matters not
therefore to which class a man belongs, he will be a
true holiday maker if he rejoices in the glow of the
summer and remembers that a man should work to
live and not live. to work. There are times when a
rest is not merely a recreation, but a genuine re
creation of the worn fibers and -tissues of the body
and the faculties of the mind. Vacation is more than
a social fad. It is â¢something that men and- women,
whether they stay in town or go abroad/ should try
to live, up to.
It would be foolish to debate which of the two
sets of citizens is the wiser or which has. the better
time. He Â«is a wise man who leaves San Francisco to
make himself acquainted with the varied beauties and
delights of the country, whether by seashore or in
the mountains, and a good time awaits him if he
have any capacity whatever for enjoyment either of
scenery, sport, fruit, flowers or hospitality. On the
other hand he is equally wise who decides to spend
his Â¦Â¦Summer leisure -in San Francisco and make him
self acquainted with his family and neighbors by
seeking such pleasures as are to be found here and
in the immediate suburbs.
WITH the coming of the holiday season the
urban population- of the country divides
itself into two classes; 5 one class goes away
for the summer and the ; other class stays at home.
The first class exclaims, "The city is deserted!" The
second class looks around at the crowd of visitors
and excursionists and says, "The. city is crowded!"
It is thus evident that the two classes live in differ r
ent worlds and -see different things or else that one
of the two lies â under a mistake. .
THE HOLIDAY SEASON.
CENSUS BULLETIN- '.No. 164 gives statis
tics relating to agriculture in California. It
says:' "The farms of California, June 1, 1900,
numbered 72,542, and had a value of $707,912,960.
Of this amount '$77,468,000, or 10.9 per cent, repre
sents the value of buildings, and $630,444,960, or 89.1
per cent, the value of land and improvements other
than buildings. On the same date the value of farm
implements and machinery was $21,311,670, and that
of livestock $67,303,325. These "values, added to that
of farms, give $796,527,955, the total value of farm
property." ... ,
The total- value of farm products for 1899 was
$l3i;6oo,6o6, of which amount $36,324,894 represents
the value of animal products and $95,365,712 the value
_of crops and forest products,. The ".value of the total
prpduct for the year exceeded that of 1889 by $44,
657,316, or 51:3 per cent. The percentage of gross
income, upon investment fdr 1899 was 14.8..
In a review of the State generally from an agri
cultural-point of view the bulletin says that of the
total area of 99,827,200 acres only,28,828,95i acres, or
,28.9 per cent, ar e included in farms: rate of' in-'

In reporting the agricultural development by
counties the report says: "In San Francisco and
Tuolumne counties the number of farms 4 reported in
1900 was more. than double that of ten years before,
and in Inyo, Siskiyou and Los Angeles counties the
gains were nearly as great. Seven counties show de
creases, but, with the . exception of Colusa and
Amador, whose losses are 43.4 and 20 per cent, re
spectively, they were all comparatively. slight. The
decrease in Colusa County was doubtless due to a
change in boubdary since 1890. The total area of
farm â¢ land in the . State is 34-5 per cent; greater than
in 1890. In' . Tuolumne,. San Francisco, Mono,
Orange, Kern and Inyo counties the farm area more
than doubled. Of the decreases shown the largest
were for Colusa and San Bernardino counties." ' .
The growth of the orchard industry .during the de
cade is one of the marvels of the development of the
State. Within that period the ntfmber of orchard
trees increased from 7,824,892 to 28,138,471. The
value of the orchard; product was not reported in the
census of 1890, but in -1879 it was $2,017,314, while in
1899 it amounted to $14,526,786, being- a sixfold gain
in twenty years.

It was after Collector Leach had made
these denials to Garfleld that Senatoi
Kanna went to the White House. The
Interview lasted for nearly an hour,
v.-htn Senator Hanna came away he said
that the charges which had been made
by Representative Burton were ridicu
lous. He could not understand what was
the matter with Burton, and said the lat
ter had no ground for complaint. He also
said that th,ere would be no Investigation
and that the whole thing was- too trivial
to occupy the attention of the President.
Hanna said that it would be*difflcult to
draw the line as to where Federal offl
auls should refrain from taking an inter
eft In public affairs. It would be ridicu
lous to say that because a man held a
Federal office he must cease to take part
In the primaries of his party, and no
President has ever yet been able to make
a hare and fast rule. Senator Hanna In
dicated that there was danger of a sever
ance of the pleasant relations between
himself and the President.
Friends of Burton, who is still absent in
Virginia, took a different view. They say
that Burton has to make good his threat
to file formal charges against the Hanna
officials or be in a ridiculous position.
Senator Hanna's enemies â¢ in Ohio an
seeking to keep the feud alive and have
been sending many messages to Burton
urging him to press for an Investigation
Their activity bids fair to defeat theii
ends, because the minute the President
rihds out that other politicians are using

In this respect one Judge is just as trustworthy as
another, and there is not an intelligent member of
either party in the city who doubts that any of our
Superior Judges will give the case a fair trial, and
that when a finality is reached in the Supreme Court
it will deserve the respect of all good citizens. .
All the talk about "a juicy scandal" has for its mo
tive only a chronic desire to destroy public respect
for the courts. This is a policy that is distinctly an
archistic and injurious to the legal and judicial sup
port of our institutions, and to the rights of person
and property. Lawyers may have their own mo
tives about Judges and cases. Their obligations as
officers of the court restrain them within , certain
bounds. Newspapers are under no restraint but the
sense and conscience of those who dictate their pol
icy, and if these be depraved society suffers in.no
respect more keenly than when this irresponsibility
is directed against the courts
It has been put on record by members of_the Ex
aminer's party In this city that it has demanded in
party conventions the defeat of certain men and the
selection of certain others for nomination to judi
cial positions. One of the few things recently put to
the credit of that party is its resistance to these de
/ mands, when assent would have created a judiciary
representing the Examiner and not the people. '
In the matter of the current attack .upon Judge
Cook the parties to the action do not intend that
the decision of the Superior Court shall stand as the^
law of the case. Whatever the decision may be, an
appeal will be taken to the Supreme Court, to the
end that the finality may have the sanction of that,
bench. The issue affects, in one of its most impor
tant provisions, the fundamental law of San -Fran
cisco, and the inconvenience of individuals and the
temporary interruption of official authority may well
be borne with pa^ence, in order that the value of
that part of the charter may be judicially determined.
It must in fairness be said for the Mayor and for his
new appointees and for the members of the old
board that they have all shown a commendable de
sire to proceed decently and ip order in the matter,
and whatever element of littleness of%pirit and de
sire to injure the courts may be in it is supplied en
tirely by the Bulletin and Examiner. It is sought to
infuse a partisan spirit into the trial. If the issue be
political a Republican has just as much right to ask
that it be tried by a Republican Judge as a Democrat
that it go to judgment before a court of his own
faith.
Human society is held together by the integrity of
judicial courts. Public confidence in Judges is even
more necessary than purity of the ballot. The gen
eral uprightness of American courts is the glory of
the republic. Legal questions seem intricate to lay
men, who take no time for their study, and' nothing
is easier than for a designing and evil disposed news-,
paper to misrepresent the decisions of courts and
interfere with that judicial independence and im
partiality which, are necessary to the proper admin
istration of justice.
Judge Cook, as presiding Judge, has control of
the quo warranto proceeding, which will validate or
vitiate the title of the old Board of Health to its of
fice, and of course will determine the right of the
Mayor to make vacancies by removal and fill them
by appointment. Judge Cook can elect to try the
case himstlf or can assign it to another Judge, or
can call others to sit with him in the hearing. For
doing or not doing any or either he is no more to be
abused and charged with ulterior, motives than was
Judge Sloss for his obvipusly correct decision in the
injunction case brought by the old Board of Health.
Just why these two newspapers persist in this pecu
liar knocking of the courts is not plain. The Ex
aminer's law department is in the habit of manufac
turing legal principles that are unknown in the
science of the law, and when a court decision is not
to its liking it appeals to itself, or to a mass-meeting,
for a reversal.
' I >HE Examiner example is regarded as worthy
I of imitation by the Bulletin. The Examiner
Â¦*â¢ attacked Judge Sloss ior his perfectly proper
decision that the title to an office cannot be tried in
an injunction suit. Mayor Schmitz, who has an in
telligent conception of judicial proceedings and de
sires that the powers which he claims to exercise un
der the charter shall have judicial sanction, followed
the course pointed out by Judge Sloss and has
brought a quo warranto suit to try the title of the
Board of Health, which was involved in tHe decision
of Judge Sloss. The right of the Mayor to remove
members of the boards created by the charter is in
issue. It is among the great powers conferred upon
the executive of the city. If it be wrongly conferred
and in violation of the constitution, the Mayor and
the people should know it at once. The only way
to know whether it is his right or not is by resort to
the courts. The Mayor has taken that course. The
Examiner abused one Judge for pointing out the
way, and the Bulletin is now abusing another be
cause that way is taken in his court.

That is the situation. By exempting the .bonds
from taxation we would place our own investors
upon equal terms with outside investors. We would
thus be enabled to sell the bonds to better advan
tage, and at the same time retain the bonds within
the State. That would mean a saving of the interest
charges that are now sent abroad: It would, more
over, lighten the rate of interest that municipalities,
counties and districts have to pay. In short, argu
ment for the .measure is overwhelming. The
amendment is known as Senate constitutional
amendment No. 3. Make a note of it. Work for it.
Vote for it.
The current number of California Municipalities
says: "The estimated total amount of public bonds
outstanding "is in round numbers $16,000,006, one
half of this amount being the bonds of municipalities,
the remainder being the bonds of the State, counties
and school districts. Of this amount less ' than
$1,000,000 is listed for taxation purposes; that is to
say, private investors, residents of this State, prob
ably hold less than one-sixteenth of our public
bonds. The annual interest charge on these bonds is
approximately $750,000. This charge has to be met
by taxation, and our taxpayers are contributing the
much larger portion of this sum to the enrichment
of Eastern investors."
No State or nation can tax'its own bonds to ad
vantage. The United States does not attempt to do
so, neither should the State of California.
The taxation of public bonds is designed to add to
.the revenues of the State, but as a matter of fact very
little revenue is derived from it because most of* the
bonds are held abroad and cannot be reached by
California Tax Collectors. Despite the fact that they
thus" escape taxation, they are sold subject to the
tax and have to bear a rate of interest sufficient to
protect the purchaser against it. If the interest rate
be not high enough for that purpose the bonds have
to be sold at a discount. The consequence is that
we not only lose the tax, but we also lose the amount
of interest paitLto covexthe tax. â¢ '
The amendment- has been under consideration a
long time, and further argument is hardly needed
uponvit now. The League of California Municipal^'
ties, which represents Â¦seventy-five of the incorpor
ated cities and towns of the State, stands responsible
for the passage of the amendment by the Legisla-
ture, and is now actively working to procure its
adoption 'by the people. The support of the league
gives assurance " that the measure" is in the interest
of municipalities. As a: matter of fact it is in the in
terest of the whole State and of all the people of the
State. The taxation of public bonds is a handicap
upon public improvements, and seriously interferes
with the advancing welfare of the commonwealth and
all its counties and cities.
BEFORE the excitements of the campaign be
gin and the thoughts of the people aVe ab
sorbed in the struggle of rival parties and the
personal fortunes of candidates, attention t should be
â¢given to the proposed constitutional amendment
which provides that "all bonds hereafter issued by
the State of California, or by any county, city and
county, or municipal corporation, or district (includ
ing school, reclamation and irrigation districts),
within such State, shall be free and exempt from tax
ation." V

In this situation we beg to assure the Prison Di
rectors that if they proceed with an earnest investi
gation, intended to get at the facts and not to dodge
them, we will furnish them with enough testimony to
establish every material charge that has been made.
Forged bills cannot; be made to swear to affidavits
that they are true bills, and the official solder ap
plied by the Governor to supposed leaks may have
been wasted at the wrong place in the pipes. We
anticipated this cours'e on his part, and therefore we
said that the accounts might be shuffled, the books
substituted and the"torch put to the prison itself,
and yet we would present substantiating evidence to
prove the charges. We repeat and affirm, that of
fer, and the people want to know what the Prison
Directors are going to do about it.
The narrow Gage road-is not the one for them to
travel toward public confidence.
The testimony of the records which has been given
to the public shows the forgery of bills and accounts,
the manufacture, Unlawfully, out of the State's prop
erty, of articles which have been presented with an
exceeding impartiality that has distributed them to
the private homes of officials and resorts under le
signe rouge. Bills paid by the State show a multi
tude of articles that are not prison supplies. The
revelations make necessary a public investigation of
the most searching character. This was admitted
and the inquiry was demanded by the Governor, and
the Warden, but now both seek to block it with
forestalling affidavits, secured under duress from per
sons without whose testimony they think nothing
can be proved. ' â
The Governor is perfectly aware that this per
formance at plumbing is not an investigation. He
knows that such an attempt to forestall testimony is
a vain thing, and that his inquiry behind the door ap
pears to have been in his own interest, to sophisticate
testimony in the suits he intends to bring for the re
pair of his own reputation. If there be crime in the
conditions revealed by The Call the Governor made
himself particeps criminis, we did not, and after or
dering himself into the dock he can do his case no
good by using his power as Governor to manufacture
testimony. But he has added that to the prison in

they had not given out any information and that they

It is perfectly apparent that the Governor was
called into the case only as an official plumber, to
hunt for the leaks through which information of the
true condition. of the prison escaped. â¢- Believing that
he had found them, last Sunday he soldered >them
with affidavits. He compelled persons connected
officially with the prison as subordinates of the War-
'conclusion over his own signature, and his organs
give no reasons for the finding which they say he has
public the Governor, in a signed statement, said that
it did not concern him at all, but that he had perfect
confidence in - Warden Aguirre and demanded the
broadest investigation of that official, ' confident that
it would vindicate him. The Warden also demanded
investigation. In those days investigation was sung
as a duet by the Governor and Warden, with chorus
by the organs of the-Governor. .The Prison Direct
ors offer a proper and broad road to an investiga
tion, but they have not moved, and the Governor
has taken the matter up, has investigated on a nar
row road, behind closed doors, and announces no
guilty, will proceed to. bring criminal and civil suits
against ThelCalland Los Angeles Times.

The report says: "From 1850 to 1900 the popula
tion of California increased from 92,597 to 1,483,053,
or sixteenfold, while the number of farms increased
from 872 to 72,542, or over eightyfold. In other
words, from 1850 to 1900 the number of farms," and
hence the number of persons operating. them as own
ers or tenants/ increased faster than the population.
This statement applies also, to the decades, 1850 to
i860, 1870 to 1880, and 1890 to 1900."

LEG AMPUCATED.â Gladys Sine, aeed 3
years, and residing at 76S Folsom street, was
run over by a Folsom-street car yesterday
afternoon and sustained a fracture of the right
leg. She was removed to the Emergency Hos
pital and it was found necessary to amputate
the leg above the knee.
Section 1032 â The public records and other
matters in the office of any officer are at all
times, during office hours, open to the in
epectlon of any citizen of this State.
The press is a thorn in the side- of the
great conductor of a businesslike admin
istration. The San Francisco Call and
the Sacramento Bee persist in sending
reporters to see the official records relat
ing to public expenditures and pardons.
Section 1032 of the Political Code is par
ticularly obnoxious to Governor Gage and
the Los Angeles gang that infests San
Quentin and Sacramento. The section
reads:
A short time ago the Governor sought
to release on parole from Folsom prison
an offender who happens to be close to
a water front statesman. In this case
the Governor ran against a snag, as
there was a prior conviction against the
prisoner. When Gage heard that some
one connected with the prison had fol
lowed the usual custom of making inquiry
as to whether a "prior" existed his Excel
lency was highly indignant. His indigna
tion was so intense that he threatened to
set aside the "prior conviction" and re
lease the prisoner, but he decided to wait.
The purpose of the administration to
work the State prisons for all that they
are worth politically is now obvious to
the people of California.
PRIOR CONVICTION SNAG.
The story comes from Colusa that
Brick has a friend in the person of a
â¢well known machine politician. Gage be
ing a rampant seeker for an extension of
the Gage-Kevane-Aguirre regime, studied
to please the push.
As the Supreme Court sustained the
judgment of the Superior Court in the
conviction of Brick for the crime of, mur
der in the first degree, the proceedings
must have been according to law, but the
executive, constituting himself reviewer
of the tacts and the law, says. the crime
waa manslaughter and not murder.
Doubtless Foley, Kevane and Aguirre
concurred in this ruling of the executive.
It is now proper for the Supreme Court
to observe that the Gage-Kevane court
has reversed the Judgment of the court
which the constitution recognizes. . In the
case of the paroled highbinder the Gov
ernor assumed that the cook was probably
ini'ocent.
Whereas, Said Patrick Brick has actually
served a term of fifteen years' confinement In
the State prison at Folsom; and
Whereas, In view of the facts and the good
character of said Patrick Brick, both before
and after his imprisonment, it appears that
justice and clemency require in this case a
full and unconditional pardon; -
Now, therefore, by virtue of the authority
In me vested by. the constitution and laws of
the State, I, Henry T. Gage, as Governor of
the State of California, do hereby pardon the
said Patrick Brick, and order upon the receipt
of these presents that he be discharged from
custody, and restored to citizenship.
GAGE'S CONTEMPT OP COURT.
Whereas, The highest punishment prescribed
for manslaughter was then and still is ten
years' imprisonment; and
Whereas, Upon an examination of the
facts of the case. I I find that the
prisoner was convicted of the crime
during a period of Â«reat popular excite
ment, due to the previous murder of Dr. Glenn,
committed in the same locality some few
months prior to the killing of Jones by said
Patrick Brick, and prejudice was engendered
thereby against said Brick, and it further con
clusively appears to me that the killing of
Jones by said Patrick Brick was in a sudden
quarrel and heat of passion, and immediately
after being- violently assaulted and knocked
down by said deceased, so that the highest
crime for which said Patrick Brick should have
been lawfully convicted, if proper to convict
at all, was manslaughter; and
Patrick Brick in 18S5 was tried in the
Superior Court of Colusa County and con
victed of the crime of murder in the first
degree and sentenced to be hanged,. whlcn
Judgment and sentence .were thereafter
affirmed on appeal to the Supreme Court.
Governor Stoneman commuted the sen
tence to life imprisonment. Governor
Waterman was asked to grant a pardon
but declined to interfere. Governor Mark
ham was similarly asked, Â¦ but declined.
Governor Gage granted an unconditional
pardon. In giving reasons for his clem
ency the executive said:
MUBDER IN FIRST DEGREE.
Governor Gage and the attaches of his
Los Angeles law office cannot, it seems,
transact the business of the State in an
open, legitimate fashion. They resort to
all sorts of peculiar dodges to withhold
knowledge of official facts from the pub
lic. . Gage, Foley, Â¦ Agulrre and Kevane
stand Â¦ in together. Special effort was
made ; to conceal the fact that the Gov
ernor, in ..the'-" latter part of Â¦ May, 1901,
gave a full pardon to Patrick Brick. The
Sacramento Bee, \ getting a hint that
Brick had been given his freedom, sent to
the Governor's office for a copy of the
record in the case. The record book was
inspected, but it contained no entry .of
the pardon. Foley, the private secretary,
had no information to impart. The re
porter of the Bee, having had some ex
perience in dealing with the attaches of
the Governor, pursued the investigation
in another direction and finally brought
to light the record. In due time the rec
ord book was filled up to correspond with
the facts, but the record was not placed
where It should have been entered until
the Bee exploited the story.

Mrs. Schmitz smiled graciously and
seemed to enjoy the popularity of her
husband. ;>'i , .
The third division was In charge of
Marshal William H. Walker. A large
band led the members of Syria, Lu Lu,
Rajah and Almas temples. The various
temples were preceded by their drill corps
and the people were treated to some
clever drilling. . Â¦
The fourth division, forty strong, with
John B. McCune, grand marshal, at its
head, swung into line and made a grand
showing in their colors of blue and red.
The division- was composed of Aladdin
Temple, Al Koran Temple, Moslem
Temple,, Saladin ' Temple and Syrian
Temple.
The fifth division, led by John W.
Swatek, marshal, and composed of Medl

ple Za Za Zlg Temple and Zurah Temple,

and. elicited great applause from the
crowds. Â¦ ' Â¦ Â¦,-

where a grand rally and drill were given.
In the thirteenth section were the car
riages containing the Imperial Council,
commanded by Marshal Charles L. Field.
In the twelfth division, commanded by
Thomas W. Browne, marshal, was the
second section of the Islams. Following
them came > a band, and behind the mu
sicians were three Scotch pipers, repre
sented by Ed Ross,: Adam Ross and Neil
Lindsley of the Islams. Virgil Logan, the
Isiams' mascot, rode on a pony.
Following the eleventh division came
the infernal floatâ a float representing a
steaming caldron,* into which the devils
cast all who came to them. The truth
was that at the bottom of the caldron
was a bar, hence the readiness with
which these characters Jumped into the
hole. As each jump meant a drink, the
boys kept things going at a lively gait. â¢
THE INTERNAL FLOAT.
The tenth division was led by the Pen
eacola band. G. W. Baker was marshal
and his aids were J. A. Brltton, V. W.
Gaskell, L. L. Nelson, M. E. Galnes and
Byron \ Mauzy. The ' nobles wore " the
Shriner fez and carried wooden canes,
presenting an imposing appearance. Fol
lowing the Oakland, delegation came a
comical band, which discoursed discords
to the great amusement of the crowd.
The eleventh division was composed of
the first section of Islam- Temple, San
Francisco, with R. B. Moore as marshal
and Walter Brunt his aid. The San Fran
cisco Shrlners were out In force, they be
ing 1000 strong in the two sections;. afoot

SPECIAL SALE
To-Day and Thursday.
HERE'S STIRRING NEWS OF THE
RAREST SKIRT VALUES IT WAS EVER
OUR GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND FOR
YOU.
Seventy-five in all â and the maker is
glad there weren't more, for he thinks he
lost enough as it was. ' They're swell â a
. glance will show that. But we want you
to note in particular the rich, heavy silkaâ
the stylish shapes â the graceful . hang â the
dashing swing â the beautiful trimmings â
the careful making â the dainty trimming.
It will be sheer extravagance â downright
folly â to pay regular prices elsewhere
while this chance is open.
BLACK SILK SKIRTS $10.00
. Extra good $15, $13.50 and $12.50 values.
BLACK SILK SKIRTS $15.00
The kinds that sell everywhere at $25
$22.50, $20 and $18. .
BLACK SILK SKIRTS S2O.OO
Big money's worth even at $27.50 and $25.
BLACK SILK SKIRTS $25.00
You'd cheerfully pay $35, $32.50 -and $30
if asked to.
BLACK SILK SKIRTS $30.00
Regular prices $45. $42.50 and $40^ â and
real good value at j these figures.
BLACK SILK SKIRTS $45.00
You never knew equal skirt elegance for
less than $60.

THISTLES AND DANDRUFF.
An. Interesting Parallel and a Valu-
able Deduction Therefrom.
Cutting down thistles no more relieves
the land of thistles than . does scouring
the scalp cure dandruff. In each case per-
manent relief can only come from eradi-
cating permanently the cause. , A germ
that ' plows â¢ up the scalp in searching for
the hair root, where it saps the vitality,
causes dandruff, falling hair and bald-
ness. If you kill that germ you'll have no
dandruff, but a; luxuriant suit of hair.
Newbro's Herpiclde is the only hair prep-
aration in the world that cures dandruff,
falling hair and . baldness by killing the
germ. "Destroy the cause, you remove
the effect." . .. ;

Tlie Kynance sailed from Antwerp in a
snowstorm and was compelled twice to
run for shelter. During the voyage a
Filipino passenger and a Chilean . sailor
bad a bloody battle, and when the day.
broke yesterday^ morning the crew's opin
ion of the ship was revealed in foot-long
letters that on. one bow spelled "starva
tion" and on the other "hungry." ; _
The Kynance left Antwerp December
6. On account, westerly gates, and
blinding snowstorms she was, compelled
on December 8 to run into Flushing and
anchor. She remained there until Decem
ber 15. The voyage was resumed, but on
December 19 the storm drove the ship to
the shelter of Margaret Roads, where she
remained until the following day. Storms
continued until latitude 30 north was
reached. She was off the River Platte
February 17 and "was becalmed for ten
days. She encountered heavy weather
off the Horn and variable winds all the
way to port. . â¢
While off the. South "American coast
Juan Valasquez, a Chilean sailor, quar
reled with a . Filipino passenger. . They
fought it out with fists, and- the Filipino
was worsted. In revenge the passenger
ambushed the Chilean the following day
and laid open his head with al belaying
pin. Valasquez, who, although down,
was not out, attacked his assailant. Mem
bers of the crew joined in the mix-iip,
and when' hostilities ceased there were
many broken- heads; Valasquez came -out
of the fray with five knife wounds in his
body. He recovered. " ""
The sailors' complaints of the quality
and quantity of food served did not meet
with the consideration the mariners
thought proper, and more than half the
crew deserted soon after the anchor was
dropped. Before leaving the vessel, how
ever, they painted the word "Starvation
on the starboard bow and "Hungry on
the port bow. t They used red paint, and
wrote the criticism in letters of heroic
dimensions. Â¦ â¢ , _. ,

ADVERTISEMENTSTHE LATE SCHOLAR WHO SERVED FOR MANY YEARS IN THE FACULTY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFOR
NIA, MEMORIAL LODGE IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY ERECTED IN HONOR OF HIS MEMORY, AND THE
HALF DOME WHICH HAS BEEN RECHRISTENED "LE CONTE PEAK."
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway, June 10.
The Grand Jury to-day investigated the
charge that G. B. Daniels and Henry P.
Dalton secured money from the treasury
of Alameda County for assessment books
that were never manufactured or deliv
ered. Three witnesses were examined.
Deputy County Auditor Myron A. Whid
den was before the Grand Jury all of the
morning and the greater part of the aft
ernoon session. Whidden testified as to
the number of bills ; that had passed
through his office, the character of the
supplies and the bills covered. The testi
mony of Whidden developed a peculiar
condition of affairs in the County As
sessor's office. During the four years
when the County Assessor was paid a
gross sum out of which he was to run his
office and put the balance in his pocket
not a single order for working assessment
rolls was placed with any printer. During
the three years of Dalton's second term,
Â¦when the county paid for the books, there
have r>?en several hundred volumes or
dered at the Enquirer office. Whidden
showed the Grand Jury that when Coun
ty Assessor Dalton first took office the
eld rolls of the county, that had been
made by Assessor Leckie, were still in the
office. These rolls were in pencil, and
when the new Assessor took charge he
nas moved with economy. In order to
eave the making of more valuable books
and the cost of many deputies to rewrite
these rolls, a depu.ty was put at work
upon the books with an eraser and a pen
cil, merely erasing the year and substi
tuting another pencil mark year. In cases
where the tigures were to be changed this
â¢was done in the same manner. In this
way the rewriting of descriptions and a
large amount of matter was saved.
DALTON BECOMES PBODIGAL.
It was not" until Dalton's second term
of office that he began to be prodigal in
the matter of books. Whldden showed
that since Dalton's second term began
there had been one lot of fifty-nine work
ing rolls ordered, which are now in use;
another lot of sixty, which are believed to
be those found in the vault down stairs;
tho lot of seventy-five, which it is claimed
neve never been delivered, and still an
other lot of sixty, which are now in the
possession of J. B. Lanktree and for
which Lanktree holds an authorized bill
but which has never been paid. Then
there is a lot of sixteen mortgage books,
which are in the office, and the thirty
mortgage books which it is said have
never been delivered.
The only development of any impor
tance during the day was how Henry P.
Df.lton raised $S00 on the set of books
that was discovered in the office of J. B.
L&nktree.
Ditlton ordered a set of sixty working
assessment rolls during the present year.
l nis v. as in addition to the fifty-nine that
ne was then using, the sixty in the vault
in his cellar and trie seventy-live covered
by the Oakes bill. The bill was made out
to J. B. Lanktree, and the order was
placed with the Enquirer Publishing Corn
ran y. These books were made, and when
it came to delivery it was decided that It
would not be safe to turn them over at
oiice and put the biil through, but that
Lanktree should hold the bill until an op
l't-Tiune time and then put it through trie
Supervisors. So the books were turned
over to Lanktree, who kept them, to
fcether with the bill therefor, amounting
v> something less than $1003. This bill was
s pprcved by County Assessor Dalton, and
urder the present lav.- was a legal one
that cculd be passed by the Supervisors.
But here a little financiering was done,
so it is said, and County Assessor Dalton
secured from J. B. I^anktree $SO0 on the
bill, depositing both the bill and tho
Looks. This transaction was legal and the
books were made and delivered to the
Dan who advanced the money, the only
cueetions involved being the neces
sity of the books to the county and why
Assessor Dalton should hypothecate a
V-ill which was due to the Enquirer Pub
lishing Company. Of course J. B. Lank
tree was secured. He held more than
trcrth of bocks and a bill that was legal
in form and which could only be rejected
fcy the Supervisors if they decided thai
the books were unnecessary, and It is
doubtful if they could reject it even upon
that ground. As to whether the Enquirer
Â£X)t its money for making the books, that
did not concern Lanktree.
These bocks were placed under guard
by Nusbaumer last night, he claiming
that an effort would be made to smuggle
them into the Assessor's office as part of
the order of seventy-five given Oakes. As
th<Â» bill for these sixty has not been pre
ser.ted to the Supervisors, it could be
taken up and destroyed by the payment
to Laiiktree of the amount secured from
fcim upon it.
The Grand Jury then adjourned until
Thursday to secure the attendance of
Oakes.

WHIDDEN BEFORE
THE GRAND JURY
â¢ |"^?v ERKELEY, June 10.â Among the
lofty pines of Yosemlte, at the
foot of Glacier Point, the spot
'1 S-* which Professor Joseph Le Conte
loved . so ' well and where he
breathed his last, <s the place chosen for
the location of the handsome lodge to be
erected by the Sierra Club to perpetuate
the memory of the beloved scientist. This
spot was decided upon at a meeting held
In the valley last week between Professor
A. C. Lawson, chairman of the Le Conte
memorial committee of the Sierra Club,
and W. "W. Foote, W. H. Mctson and
Charles S. Givens, representing the val
ley Commissioners. As a further mark of
respect, the committee of the valley com
mission decided at the same meeting to
Conte last summer, the Sierra Club, of
which he had been an enthusiastic mem
ber, inaugurated the movement to erect a
suitable memorial In the place he loved so
well and where %o much of his scientific
labor had been expended. It was decided
to erect a lodge, which should be both a
headquarters for the club, and a place of
convenience for all visitors to the valley.
Subscriptions were started both within
the~club and among the students of the
University of California and the host of
friends and admirers of the dead profes
sor. So ready has been the response to
the demands of the club that there Is now
more than $3000 at hand and operations on
the construction of the lodge will begin
within a month. â¢ â¢
costing approximately $5000. The archi
tecture is ancient gothic and is well suit
ed to , the grandeur i of i the surrounding
landscape. The lodge will contain a
library, reading-room and assembly hall,
all finished off with native valley wood.
With sufficient funds assured,' the next
step of the memorial committee was to
secure the consent of the valley commis
sion for the erection of the memorial
lodge. The committee announced that the
lodge' was to be open to the public and
only reserved the right to haVe it remain
under the care and custody of the. Sierra
Club. After some correspondence the val
ley Commissioners announced their readi
ness to lease the club one acre of ground
at any desirable point, .the lease to be re
newed every ten years. Their only de
mand was that the plans for the building
should be submitted to them for approval.

TRAINER LEAN
AGAIN IN COURT
Wife of Olympic Club
Man Brings a Suit
for Divorce.
Remarriage That Occasioned
Great Surprise Proves a
Failure.
Al Lean,' the well-known Olympic Club
trainer, is again in trouble with his wife,
and for a second time the divorce court
has been appealed to to straighten out
their matrimonial entanglements. This
time Mrs. Lean is the plaintiff. She filed
a suit fox divorce yesterday, accusing
Lean of infidelity and naming Bertha
Jones as co-respondent.
The troubles of tlie Leans commenced
last February, when Lean sued his wife
for divorce on the ground of intemper
ance. Mrs. Lean filed a cross-complaint,
in which* she accused her husband of mal
treating her. The suit was heard before
Judge Kerrigan, who granted Mrs. Lean
the divorce. The decree was signed March
14, and husband and wife went their sep
arate ways until April 29, when, to the
surprise of their friends, they remarried.
Their happiness was short lived, for Mrs.
Lean in the suit filed yesteday alleges
that her husband's attentions to Miss
Jcnes became known to her within the
week following the second marriage.
Annie Breeser has brought a suit for
divorce against Gustav Breeser on the
ground of cruelty. She allege3 that sinc3
their marriage in 1S90 he has made her
unhappy and miserable by frequently
beating her black and blue. She alleges
also that she has had to flee from their
home at midnight to save herself. â¢- -i
Jewel H. Smith, who was married to
Perrin B. Smith at Ophir, Placer County,
in August, 1S93, is suing for divorce on the
grounds of desertion and failure to pro
vide. She alleges that Smith left her a
year ago and that since that time she
has had to depend upon her own efforts
for support.
D. Howard Foote secured a divorce from
Florence L. Foote in Judge Graham's
court yesterday on the ground of crutlty.
Mrs. Foote resides in the East.
Caroline Loui3e Delahay Is suing James
Albert Delahay for divorce, alleging de
sertion and failure to provide. They were
married In December, 1800, and have ona>
child. The alleged desertion occurred two
months after the wedding.
Charles E. Morse, an engineer on the
steamer City of Peking, was ordered by
Judge Seawell yesterday to pay hi3 wife,
Minnie Morse, $40 a month during the
pendency of a suit for divorce brought by
Mrs. Morse. She charges her husband
with desertion.
Annie C. Postel, who Is suing F. O. F.
Postel for divorce on the ground of cru
elty, will recive $25 a month alimony until
the suit is decided. Judge Graham issued
an order to that effect yesterday.
Thomas B. Eagan, who receives $150 a
month from the United Railroads, was
very much subdued when he appeared be
fore Judge Kerrigan yesterday at noon
to show cause why he should not be pun
ished for allowing his divorced wife, Mary
Eagan, and his seven children to. exist as
best they could without any aid from
him. He owes his wife two months' ali
mony, amounting to $130, and tried to
evade the payment by claiming that he
had not been working. The books of the
corporation showed that he had $75 com
ing to him, and the court ordered him to
pay $25 of this amount to Mrs. Eagan
without any further delay.
"You will also," said the court, "leave
at the office of your attorney on the 11th
of each month $65 alimony and $10 a
month additional until you pay up the
amount you now owe her. And I advise
you, Eagan, to make an effort to get in
favor with this court by 'doing all you
can for the little woman whom you have
so shamefully treated."
MRS. BOTKIN'S SECOND
TEIAX WILL BE HELD
Dover Witnesses Will Be Prop
erly Remunerated.
District Attorney Byington SayÂ»
District Attorney Byington was not
worried over the dispatch from Dover
published yesterday to the effect that the
Â¦witnesses against Mrs. Cordelia Botkin
would not come here because they would
not be properly remunerated for their loss
of time.
"The second trial will take place," said
the District Attorney yesterday. "I den't
think there will be any difficulty in get
ting the witnesses to come here, as they
will be properly remunerated. The Super
visors have set aside $4000 for their ex
penses, which will bring them to the State
Tine, and then the Judge can draw on the
treasury for whatever extra amount is
needed.
"Judge Cook is now on his vacation,
but I will take the first opportunity of
speaking to him and making arrangements
for bringing the witnesses here. I want
him to wait upon the Mayor and suggest
that some person should be sent to Dela
ware to get the witnesses together and
bring them to this city." I_il

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUSTE 11, 1902.
It is said at the War Department that
the Waller case is a closed incident, but
that the Smith case will not be legally
closed until it has been finally acted upon
by the President. The significance of this
statement is that it is still within the
power of the President to return- the case
to the court for the reconsideration of the
evidence adduced,: even though the officer
was acquitted- by the court, as the press
dispatches from Manila have indicated
The court could not be legally com
pelled to change its findings, however,
against . its own judgment, and its ad
herence to a verdict of not guilty would
He added that, as the Smith case was
based practically on the transaction which
led to the trial of Major L. W. T. Waller
of the marine corps by court-martial,
charged with the alleged unlawful killing
of Filipino prisoners, he would probably
await the receipt of the record of that
case before giving consideration -to the
Smith case. The Waller record is not ex
pected to reach this city for several
weeks.

SAVES BIG SUM
TO THE STATE
SACRAMENTO, June 10.â Under a rul
ing made by Superior Judge J. - "W.
Hughes this morning in the coyote scalp
suits which are being prosecuted In his
court, the State will be saved thousands
of dollars. Judge Hughes ruled that un
der the statute of 1901 the mere agent to
whom a claim, has been assigned Is nei
ther an "owner" nor a "holder" within
the meaning of the statute.
The law relating to coyote scalp claims
requires that suits on certificates shall be
commenced within one year of their Issu
ance by the "owner or holder." Hundreds
of claims, aggregating thousands of dol
lars, have been assigned to banks and
other agents for collection, and under
Judge Hughes' ruling present holders aie
merely agents. It is too late for these
ciaims to be transferred back to the orig
inal claimants and the statute of limita
tions comes, to the rescue of the State
treasury. . ; *

the Claim.
Herbert Choynski, Who Is Now in
Another attachment was Issued yester
day against the Richelieu saloon. It was
immediately released by Herbert Choyn
ski, who claims to be a partner of Charles
Newman in the profits of the business. The
attachment, which was for a little more
than $1200, was sworn out by J. F. Dunn,
an architect, who has been superintending
the alterations which Newman was mak
ing when the row over the possession of
the saloon occurred.
Choynski and his armed bartenders held
possession of the place yesterday. They
were ready for any kind of a fracas. Dur
ing the forenoon Newman entered the sa
loon In a peaceable manner and was for
cibly ejected by one of Choynski'smen.
It Is quite likely that some definite court
order will be Issued to-day wuich will put
an end to the quarrel over possession of
the resort.
* Clerk Conway 's Peculations.
It was discovered yesterday that Fred

Judge Mogan's court, had been "grafting"

date he passed an order for $5 ball money
deposited for the release of Eliza Thomp
son on a charge of drunkenness. The bail
was forfeited, but the case -was marked
"dismissed" by Conway on the court rec
ord. He made the order payable to Wal
ter Gallagher, an attorney, who had noth
ing to do with the case, and signed the
name "T. Gallagher" on the back of it
Gallagher was asked for an explanation
yesterday and the fraud came to light.

NEW YORK. June 10.â There was some im
provement in. the demand for stocks to-day
and upward progress was made by prices,
.but the market was dull and narrow to a
degree that has not been equaled for the last
two years until within a week. Dealings con
tinued almost entirely In the hands of pro
fessional room traders, but this element oper
ated with somewhat more freedom than for
several days. They were encouraged by the
return to Wall street of the leader of the so
called Western croup of speculators, to which
has been attributed all the recent Important
market movements. If there were operations
for the account of this group they were not
on a large scale, as is sufficiently attested
by the figures of the day's aggregate dealings
There was some concentrated buying of South
ern Railway, which easily led the whole mar
ket in point of activity. A single commission
house often employed by one of the large
fn?^^ interests was credited with taking
10,000 shares of this stock. There was a gen
eral expectation that the monthly crop esti
mate of the Government, which was not pub
lished until after the Stock Exchange closed
would make a very favorable showing of the
crops during May. This was a strengthening

CHICAGO, June 10. â Dry, warm weather
and lower cables that Indicated Improving
weather abroad depressed wheat at the open
ing. Outside markets also were weak. Trade
was not Inclined to do much one way or the
other, and, as usual, on Government crop
report days, assumed something of a wait
ing attitude. The crop report was expected
to show considerable Improvement over lost
month's figures, and some of the crowd start
ed to anticipate its bearish effect by selling. ,
This was true in outside markets, and in sev
eral cases the pits were oversold. Minneapo
lis started a reaction. There was some fair
covering, and elevator Interests did some good
buying. July wheat, after opening %@%c
to %@%c lower at 70%c to 70%c, advanced
to 71Vi@71%c. A large decreased world's
visible supply â 600,000 bushels â decreased
Northwestern receipts, and the Northwestern
strength held prices rather steady for somÂ»
time. July closed slightly firmer, %c higher,
at 71%@71%c.
The tine weather was a handicap to the
bull argument In corn at the start, but It
eoon save way to the support of the big bull
Interest. July closed firm, %@V4c higher,
at 62%c.
Oats ruled dull but steady. July closed
steady, unchanged at 38%c. Â¦ >
Provisions were dull, but strong. Hogs were
weaker, but packers' Itod stuff for higher
prices, and advanced the quotations on a few
artificial sales. July pork closed 22%c up;
lard, 2%@0c higher, and ribs, 27%c up.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
London Market.
' NEW TORK, June 10. â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says :
Stocks were J die and dull. As the new ac
count will have a record shortness of twelve
days owing to the coronation festivities little
business is expected. Consols were weak at 97.
Americans were . firm on strike settlement ru-.
mors and the expectation of a good crop re
port. Atchison Is in demand, a3 is Southern
Railway, on cotton crop prospects. Contan
goes were stiff at 5%; United States Steel and
some other stocks at 6 Money is scarce on
withdrawals to finance Kaffirs and the ap
proaching bank half year settlements. Canadian
Pacific i had a sharp setback on profit-taking.
A large amount of gold has arrived from Aus
tralia and Â£500,000 from India is due on Mon

V. B. Dimmick,"' a switchman in the
employ of the Belt Line railroad, yester
day secured the arrest of Henry B. Stew
art, superintendent of the road, on a
charge of an assault with a deadly
weapon. ?;- : .t-'; . ~
Dimmick says he was in a grocery and
saloon on the corner of Sansome and
Greenwich streets Thursday- night when
Stewart came in and asked him to have
a drink. Dimmick refused, and Stewart,
becoming angry, struck him In the face.
Stewart then stepped back, it is alleged,
and pulled a revolver out of his hip
pocket.
Arthur Flaherty, the bartender, grabbed
hold of Stewart, with the intention of
taking the revolver away from him. Dur
ing a struggle which followed Stewart
struck Flaherty on the head with the butt
end of the weapon. Flaherty held on to
Stewart, however, and finally took the re
volver from him. ' J:. *'Â¦
"If It had not been," said Dimmick to
Judge Mogan, who issued the warrant,
"that the revolver was unbreached. and
the cartridges dropped on the floor while
Flaherty and Stewart were struggling I
believe Stewart would have shot me or
Flaherty." -â¢ '-
Stewart was arrested yesterday after
noon and booked at the Harbor police
station. His bonds are $2000, or $1000 cash.
S. N. Rev. B. M. "Weeden will perform
the ceremony at St. Luke's Church. A
breakfast will follow at the Bella Vista,
where the bride has been living with her
mother, Mrs. Messersmith, for some time.
Mrs. Mace comes of one of the best
Southern families, and is a great-grand
daughter of Francis Scott Key. Lieuten
ant Palmer Is a North Carolinian and
graduate of Annapolis. He Is at present
stationed at Mare Island.

dence of the bride's sister, Mrs. J. J.

At a meeting of the San Francisco Dairy

of Messrs. W. H. Roussel, . F. ,H. Brig

to investigate the matter, and do every
thing in its power to prevent the intro
duction of oleomargarine into this State.

SAN" FRANCISCO. June 9, 1902.
Ban Francisco Call â Gentlemen: At a meet
ing of the board of directors of the San Fran
cisco Dairy Exchange held this afternoon It
Â¦was resolved to take some action against the
sale of oleomargarine on the Pacific Coast,
and ?. committee was appointed to devijr ways
and means best suited to the interests of the
dairymen in preventing the introduction or
this substitute for butter in our markets. The
committee then held a meeting and decided
that in view of the fact that the San Francisco
Call took the first steps in warning the public
against the introduction of the substitute. It
would be In touch with the situation to express
our views through the columns of your paper
It is the intention of the committee to com
municate with the Humboldt and Los Angeles
creamery exchanges, asking their cc-operatlon
in arriving at the best method of preventing
the sale of this article, so dangerous to the
dairy industry. For a number of years the
State of California has been free from the sale
of oleomargarine. This was due to the strin
gent State laws pertaining to the sale and
manufacture of the same. It Is our idea that
through the pressure of your paper the present
laws can be made operative by having the
money appropriated annually utilized for the
purpose it is intended for. Instead of its being
turned back Into the treasury, as is shown
from the report of the bureau herewith handed
you, and marked on pages 26 and 27. "We have
at the present time no active Inspector and we
are standing on very, dangerous ground, when
considering the ravages that might be made
into our butter trade by the use of oleo
margarine. Tours very truly,

The announcement made by the
Armour Packing Company that it
would push the sale of oleomar
garine in this State is looked upon
with disfavor by the members . of
the San Francisco Dairy Exchange
and similar organizations. They intend
having the sale of the article prohibited
if possible. There Is a statute that does
not. permit of the sale of oleomargarine,
colored to imitate butter, in this State

such an attempt the Dairy Commission
ers, Messrs. John A. Bliss, Dr. Flint and

said that In the president's judgment the
debate should not, take place between the
universities, but between speakers of the
University of California. Such a decision
would be quite agreeable to him.
Another new appointment U that of J.

Intelligence comes from the - interioi
that the opposition to Gage is growing
stronger every day. In every nook anc
corner of California voters say that th<
State has had enough of Gage, Kevan<

eager for the favor of Gage are now go
Ing out of their way to explain that thej
are in no sense associated with the Gag<
machine. It is said that the Governoi
has gone to Los Angeles to look up somi

be out on "parole." ' r . . . .
The Gage forces in San' Francisco are
few in numbers and weak in 3pirit. All
efforts to patch up a. truce for bringing
together Burns, Crimmins, Kelly- and
Herrin have failed. Burns and Kelly are
working together to hold Clifford McCiel

gubernatorial nomination. Word comes
from the north that Humboldt County

POPULAR PRIEST WHO IS
. THE PASTOR OF ST. JOHN'S
CHURCH. V
Commissioner Blackstock made a mo
tion, which was adopted, that a committee
be appointed to draw up a document to
answer as clearly as possible the eight
square-from-the-shoulder questions that
the executive head of the State of Wash
ington would like to have answered. The
committee is composed of Commissioner
Blackstock and Secretary Sesnon.
After Governor McBride's letter had
been read by Secretary Sesnon and thor
oughly digested by the Commissioners,
the -weight of responsibility that rested on
their shoulders was evident, and Governor
Gage's diplomatic move, known in slang
as "passing the buck," was not appreci
ated.
Another question was: "Has the estab
lishment of a Railroad Commission been
effective In bringing the railroad compa
nies and the people closer together?"
Thus the questions went on, each one of
them more . embarrassing than the other.
Another puzzler was: "Has the Railroad
Commission accomplished good results?"
Governor McBride's questions are cer
tainly to the point, the solar plexus one
being: "Has the establishment of a Rail
road Commission in your State been ef
fective in divorcing railroad companies
from politics V It Is certainly a very
pointed question and when read yesterday
by the Railroad Commissioners had toe
effect of making tlie members cough anJ
cast their eyes to the ceiling. Governor
McBride's innocence was most refreshing
to the Commissioners.' f
The usually dry and matter of fact
monthly meeting of the Railroad Commis
sioners was replete with humor yester
day. Governor Gage was recently the re
cipient of a letter from Governor McBride
of "Washington stating that the people of
"Washington were seriously considering
the advisability of establishing a Railroad
Commission similar to the one in Califor
nia Governor McBride, in this letter,
asked eight interesting questions relative
to the Railroad Commission in California.
After reading the letter It is supposed
that Governor Gage thought it was too
hard a nut for him to, crack and he for
warded â¢ the communication to the Rail
road Commissioners 'it* this city, through
his secretary, W. H. X)av}s,. asking U:em
to furnish the rfeiily. ' '
