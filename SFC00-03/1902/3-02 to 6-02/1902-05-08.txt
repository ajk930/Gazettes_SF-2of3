the matter could be settled. He thought
it would cost' about $4000 altogether. 1

S gle in the Council chamber
S 1 concerning the allegations of
B * conspiracy to stifle bids for
Â¦^L^^f the supply of sewer pipe for
the city's new, system has
taken a new form, and other issues and
accusations have been dragged into the
controversy. Councilman Buhne, not
having been permitted at last evening's
session to read an affidavit In which S. A.
Campbell, Collector of Customs, is ac
cused of offering to deliver the Council
to the Sunset Telephone Company â¢ for
$4000, published its contents this evening
in the Daily Standard. The publication
created a sensation, because of the promi
nence in business and political circles of
the persons concerned and the gravity
of the charges directly and impliedly
made.
Thomas H. Selvage, Senator from the
First District and candidate for Con
gress, is the affiant. After reviewing ,1h*e
political situation and the quarrel < In the
Republican camp between J. .' C. Bull and
S. A. Campbell, Republican leaders, and
C. S. Milnes, editor of the Dally Times,
on one side, and J. F. Thompson, editor
of the Daily Standard, and Selvage on the
other, the Senator deposes In part as fol
lows:
SENA'TOR SELVAGE'S CHARGES.
"I am a resident attorney for the Sun
set 'Telephone and Telegraph Company
of the Pacific Coast. The company has
quite an extensive system in the city of
Eureka. During the fall of 1901, i this
company sought to make Improvements
in the city of Eureka, and, as Its attor
ney, I made application in accordance
with the ordinances of the City Council
of the city of Eureka for permission to
make such extension and Improvements.
The Humboldt Times, edited and man
aged by C. â¢ S. Milnes, immediately com
menced a war. upon the telephone com
pany, and fought the granting of any
rights to the company by the city.
"The City Council referred the appli
cation to acommittee, and in the mean-/
time Sterling A. Campbell called^ me up
on the 'phone and told me he wished to

A serious train wreck occurred at Mil-
Ier, a station several miles north o( Ma
dera on the Santa Fe line, at noon yes
terday. The accident was caused by the
breaking of a kingbolt In the forward
truck of . the express car of overland
train No. 7, due to arrive in this city at
6 o'clock last evening. The express car,
combination baggage and mall car and
first passenger coach -were derailed. Flf
teen passengers were more or less seri
ously Injured. .
At the. time of the accident the train
was running at about fifteen miles an
hour and was just passing through the
station. The moment that Engineer Fitz
patrick discovered that there was some
thing wrong he "downed" the brakes
with all possible speed, and fortunately
saved the engine and tender from leav
ing the rails. He and his fireman es-.
caped uninjured, the only one of the
train crew who was hurt being Hallway
"Weigher Samuel J. Grimes, who was not'
seriously injured.
The three cars that left the rails were
thrown on their sides, but the other
five cars in the rear of the train, .includ
ing the Pullmans, were uninjured, and
none of the nassengers in these cars were
hurt.
TAKEN TO GERMAN" HOSPITAL.
As soon as possioie after the accident
Conductor Farrell, who was in charge of
the train, telegraphed to Merced for help,
but before a wrecking train arrived the
overland had been made up again ' ami
was run on to a switch. "Within an hour
after the wreck the train was again on
the main line on Its way to this city, with
several surgeons from Madera aboard
rendering aid to the injured.
The three cars' lying on their side were
left behind and but for their presence
there was no evidence that an accident
had occurred. On the arrival of the train
at Point Richmond ambulances were In
readiness for those who were the most
seriously. Injured and they were carefully
removed from the cars and upon their
arrival on this side of the bay were taken
to the German Hospital with all possible
dispatch. At a late hour last evening Dr.
A..W. Morton, the company's chief sur
geon, stated that possibly the most seri
ously Injured was Peter Lotz, who sus
tained a fracture of the seventh rib.
David M. Foltz. son of Mrs. Clara Foltt.
was taken to his home in tliis city. He
sustained internal injuries and a severely
bruised knee and two fingers of -his left
hand were crushed and his nose lacerated.
Late last evening he; was having severe
hemorrhages and his physicians said that
his Injuries were very serious.
GIRL'S STOBY OF WRECK.
Traffic officials say that the accident
was unavoidable and one that -might not
happen again in the history of railroad
ing. Miss Abble McCarthy, aged 13. who
was on the train, tells a graphic story of
the wreck. She said in an Interview last
night:
W> were running at a fair rate of spesd
ami- I tvas sitting with -another girl In the
fourth Â¦ car when the accident occurred. The
first thing "I knew was "seeing a tremendous
amount of dust. tVe closed the windows, and
the porter, who was slttlne in the same car as
myself, went forward to seÂ« what was the
matter. He came rushing back and the next
minute we were over. The engine and the
first car stayed on the rails, but the baggago
car and the possenzer car next to it went over
on their sides and our car went over on a
slant. -The four cars behind us stayed on the
rails. The Jar was tremendous. â¢ but no one In
my car was hurt, and bj the aid of passengers
In- the â¢ back ' car . we were enabled to jcet out
through the door in safety and be handed to
the sround.
People in the car ahead of us were not Â»o
fortunate. One man had a badly cut forehead;
another man, I beard them say, had a broken
rib; another had an Injury to his hip and sev
eral were contused and bruised. .

f^ ?tON, May 7.â Attorney . Gen
3 eral Knox ; to-day .completed
HL V his revision of the draft of the
bill of complaint against the
beef trusts and sent it Â¦ to the printer.
The Attorney General declined to make
any statement as to. its provisions, and
former Judge W. A. Day, who is actively
associated with, him as special counsel,
was equally reticent. , ;
Big news in connection with the Gov
ernment's proceedings against the beef
octopus is said to be. that the. bill of com
plaint will ask .for the immediate en
joining of various \ packing houses from
further combining.? for. the lowering of
prices at the stock 'yards; for .the' rais
ing of- prices on the butcher's block; for
the blacklisting of dealers and employes,
and various other unlawful acts .which
have made its name. an object of wrath
to the whole American ,. people. By an
immediate injunction v is meant that si
multaneously with ;the filing of the bill
of complaint and the issuance of an or
der by a United States judge in Chicago,"
the beef trust will be as completely
blocked in its efforts to filch dollars il
legally from the pockets of the public as
though armed United States â Marshals
had stepped in and taken it3 agents into
custody^ and 1 possessed. themselves of the
great .packing plants. -"In other words, as

by the bill of. complaint and accompany
ing affidavits, and the other would have
been to have 'asked "the court to receive
papers and appoint, a master in equity
to take testimony for the purpose, of es
tablishing facts on' which, an injunction
might issue. One would have meant in
stant action, the other delay. The. for
mer ;, has" been chosen. In this case so
thorough has been the" work of former
Judge Day and District Attorney Bethea
and so full and convincing has been the

in the above orders was at once the most
effective and ' humane which could : possi

UPHOLDS GENERAL SIOTH.
It Is useless for me to make an attempt to
show the necessity for the course adopted in
the Third and Sixth brigades to put an end to
the" active insurrection existing there in I such
a way that all persons will agree that right
action has been taken. . It Ui impossible, . of
course, for me to do thla. I will state, 'howr
ever that personal contact with the people,- a
knowledge of their methods and sentiments, â¢ a
personal .'.- acquaintance with . the . terrain and
what may be done by an enemy as by troops,
are all essential i to determine what should be
done before condemninc j what has been - done.
It is also necessary that some other", method
be suggested and positfve proof submitted that,
had it been followed, more success correspond
ingly would have followed Its adoption than
would have been secured by the present course.
I do not understand that the authority of the
"United States in these islands can be indefinite
ly disputed by armed forces without efforts to
terminate the resistance . to that authority.' On
the other hand, Â¦ I understand that all â¢ means
which are justified by the lawe of war -arc to
be appliftdln such form as will meet.and^de
feat the method of warfare adopted by the
enemy. If desperate In the last case, more des
perate must be the attack to end it. Â¦'â¢ Every
care has been taken that^ people required to re
main under military. Bwrveillance Ehall ' not un
duly suffer for food, shelter or Â¦ medical:atten
tion If needed. ,..-â¢ ' ' - Â¦ "
Another order transmitted is by Major
General Lloyd Whcaton, dated Manila,
March 24,-1902, upon the condition of the
natives collected in the ! concentration
camps, from which it appears that they
were well fed, healthful . and - contented.
General Wheaton expresses the belief that
the camps can be. broken up -within ; sixty
days. An important indorsement on this
report is by General Chaff ee, in which he
says:. Â¦ â¢ ; --' ; ,
INDORSED BY CHAFFEE.
The brigade commander therefore announces
for the information of - all concerned that
wherever prisoners or unarmed or defenseless
Americans or native^ friendly to the United
States Government are murdered or assassi
nated for political reasons, and this fact can
be established. It is his purpose to-. execute a
prisoner of war under the authority contained
in sections 50 and 14S. This prisoner of â¢ war
will be selected by lot from among the officers
or . prominent citizens . held as prisoners of
war and will be chosen when practicable from
those who belong, to the town in which the
murder or assassination occurred.
The Secretary 'explains that the order
referred to was approved by Abraham
Lincoln," and that the order mentioned In
the resolution and in Bell's order of De
cember 13 were in strict conformity with
the letÂ£er and spirit of this famous order,
which he says' "was a contribution of
great and recognized value."

HANFORD, May 7.â Large bodies
of delegates to the thirty-fifth
encampment, Grand Army of the
Republic, Department of Califor-
Peters, it is said, kept under cover,
leaving the matter of disposing of the
prints to Graham. The latter met Brady
at the Metropole Hotel by appoint
ment on Tuesday afternoon. Graham,
according to his accusers, explained that
he had the complete set of the blue
prints of the plans pfthe Holland sub
marine boat, including the plans of the
entire machinery. He said he wanted
$3000 for the set, bujt Brady would not
agree to pay any money until he had
seen the drawings, j
They met again at the Metropole
Hotel to-day, where Graham had hired
a room. He told Brady that he was
staying there, but as a matter of fact
the detectives said | he only hired the
room for the purpose ;.of showing the
goods. ,'. \
I . TAKEN BY v DETECTIVES. - Â¦
j Before Brady went to the hotel hevis
ited police" headquarters and explained
the case to Detective Sergeants O'Con
tiell and Pepperted.- .VThey went to the
hotel and got a' room- adjoining that in
-which Brady and Graham met. When
Â¦the latter arrived at the Metrooole he
had only a few. of the blue prints with
him. Brady- insisted, upon seeing the en
tire sÂ«t. whereupon: Graham told him that
they bad been .sent H&eger's storage
warehouse at Thirty-fourth street and
Eighth avenue.
: There.it was learned that a man who
said he s was James Forsythe had de
posited the drawings. They were in a
,long box. . .
After Bra.dy promised to pay $3000 for
the blue prints Graham insisted tfpon ro
.ceiving the money in cash. Brady told
him -that he had written out a check, but
that he would go to the New Amsterdam
"Bank with him and cash the check. The
two then left the hotel, followed by ths
detectives, and when the bank "was
reached Graham was placed under arrest.
Peters was found near by, and he was
also taken into custody. Both '' were
locked up at police headquarters charged
-with bringing stolen property into the
State and attempting, to dispose jof:"it.
Peters, admitted stealing the blue prints,
the. detectives. . asserted, - and said- -Ahat
Graham had nothing to do with the theft.
The latter denied, that he was Implicated
in any way in the alleged theft, and said
he simply, acted as an agent for Petefs,
who said nothing Jto him as to how he
came into possession of the drawings.
These. blue prints had been in" the hands
of the officials of the Navy Department
at Washington, where they were being
carefully inspected by experts. They had
just been returned to San Francisco,
when Peters,. It is alleged, managed, to
get hold of them. Knowing the value of
the prints he was aware, the detectives
say, that he could realize a large sum on
them, but he feared to attempt negotia
tions in San Francisco. Shortly before
he left San Francisco Peters met Gra
ham, and the two started for this city.
A day or eo after th<tlr arrival here they,
as alleged, inserted advertisements in the
newspapers offering the blue prints for
sale.
T. W. Brady of 10) Broadway, who is
an electrical expert connected with the
Klizabethport (N. J.} works of the Hol
land Torpedo-boat Cpmpany, noticed the
advertisements and notined the company
at San Francisco. He then immediately
entered into correspondence with the ad
vertisers. . . . : ' . â¢

ham, 4'J years old, a .dealer in mines and
real estate at 4a .Broadway, and living at
the Rossruore Hotel, "Broaaway and ror

According to the detectives, Peters was
employed in a confidential capacity in: the
utnee ot the Holland Torpedo Boat Com
pany and the Union Iron Works, Sail
r'raneisco, acting as stenographer and
clerk to the managers of the consolidated
companies. On /Vpril IS. the detectives

I have a message to every suffering
and health-broken man in this country.
If you are afflicted with Sexual Weak-
ness or Nervous Debility, I want you
to read this article and then write to
me. I have a medicine with which I
have cured hundreds of my friends and
others who have written me for it. I
am not a- doctor or a sharper, but a
plain business man, and I want every
sveak, disappointed and debilitated man
to write to me for a copy of the for-
mula from which this wonderful medi-
cine is prepared. I do not ask you for
money. It is free.
Read the following, by "William Cole,
M. D., Washington, D. C, published in
the United States Investigating Re-
ports, regarding: the prescription from
which this remedy for curing L.Obt
Manhood is prepared:
Durirg the examination of men for the army
curing our recent war with Spain, our United
States army physicians were shocked to find
eo large a percentage o* men disqualified be-
cauEo^of nervous disorders. Xf. 1b net the pur-
pose of these reports to enter into a statement
ot causes, other than to say that the sufferer
is seldom to blame. His condition is Indeed
oepicrebie; his memcry falls him, his energy
gene, his eyesight dlmmedi his muscles soit
s.na "his nervous stamina gene. He is pitied
by those versed in nervous disorders and re-
pelled by those of both sexes who do not un-
derstand how dark the world is to him.
Some Ctteen years ago the writer gave atten-
tion â¢ to the cure of nervous disorders aad
iound that the late Dr. Wilson, Professor ol
Chemistry and Practitioner of Medicine in
Bellevue Medical College of. New York, had a
formula of wonderful power to restore ' to men
the fullness ol their physical and mental
etrength. In the year 18s3 the celebrated Dr.
Wilton died and his formula has been obtained
by L. F. Page of 201 State street. Marshall.
liichiÂ£tn, who prepares it according to the
original prescription, and from our analysis of
the came, by our Board of Investigation, we
find it composed of pure and freeh drugs, and
that it is sold under the name of "Dr. "VVil-
son'b Restorative Remedies." Our Investiga-
tion was extended into a great number of simi-
lar preparations, none of which were found
equal to the above, while many were prepared
by those who knew little or nothing about
therapeutics or raatcrla medica. Â¦ We hereby
caution the public against the use of all urcsr-
talr.- remedies and all who Â¦ need â¢. nerve-life
tringing medicine we recommend them to take
Dr. Wilson's Kestoratlve Remedies, prepaied
and sold by L. F. Page, 201 State street, Mar-
ths.ll. Michigan, and unto the aforesaid Dr.
Wilson's Restorative Remedies we extend the
official indorsement of the United States Inves-
tifatir-g Reports. . , .........
To every one who writes in good faith
I will send the full formula of this
wonderful medicine. This prescription
and full directions are sent free. Have
it filled, or if you desire, you cart buy
the remedies and prepare it privately
just as well yourself. One prescription :
will make a new man of you. One dose
will be enough /to convince you of its
' marvelous power.
Among those whose attention has
been attracted by this magnanimous,
offer is the Rev. J. S. B. Crawford uf
Waynesville, N. C, a very prominent'
divine, whose own vitality was serious-
ly impaired. Being sick of paying
money to quacks and charlatans, who
took his money without doing him any
g;ood, Mr. Crawford had the prescrip-
tion made up and took it regularly, as
he was directed. With this result, he
wat perfectly cured, and after several
years of enjoyment of his newly given
powers, made the statement publicly
that every man in need of help should
do likewise.
There are not many ministers who
â¢would be willing to publicly indorse
and recommend a cure of this kind,
with the statement that they them-,
eelves had been cured by it, but the
Rev. Crawford has in him a great
deal of true gratitude and love of man- '
kind. This is shown in a recent letter
in which he says that he makes public:
acknowledgment "in order that others
may receive the same happy results."
You are older now and can look back [
atd see the mistakes you have made,
but you cannot recall thevvlgor and fire
of the springtime of robust manhood.
Tour transgressions have left their
mark upon you. Tour errors and ex- .
cesses have ravaged your system and
undermined your nerve force. Quick-
r.cEs, backache, nervousness and debil-
itating drains and worn-out, shrunken
sund lifeless organs are making your
life a miserable existence, devoid of
pleasure. Tou hesitate and falter; you
are r.ot the man you once were, and
you know it. Cast aside your modesty.
This matter is too important. Act at
ccce with manly decision.
This formula is printed and costs me
almost nothing, and I give it free of
any charge. I do not ask it, but if you
deeire to do so. you can pay something
tfter using it. I want to help every
suffering man in America to regain his
health and strength and the ability to
enjoy the pleasures, of Hfe,as I. do. Ad-

The remains then will be taken to Arling

cial military and naval:escort.
HINGHAM, Mass., May 7.â The Hon.
John D. Long, former Secretary of '.the
Navy, was deeply, affected by the news of
the death of Admiral Sampson. He said:
â¢Admiral Sampson : stood very high in' the
navy, havinE filled many of Its most Â¦: respon
sible positions. Â¦Â¦ His career as commander-ln
chief of. the Atlantic squadron during the re-"
cent war was especially creditable. lie was In
charge of all the vessels â a great number; had
charge of the whole blockade; co-operated with
the aVmy in its landing and ' gave Â¦ the orders
and made .the preparations which resulted in
the great naval victory off Santiago. He wa=>
very modest and unassuming; had none of the
arts of popularity and knew : only his
duty. I am sure, however, that history' will
do him justice. There is nothing so pathetic
as that such a man, .who deserved only praise"
and gratitude, yet has died of a heart brokea
by abuse and ( misrepresentation. . Â¦

reply to the charges of the board that he
was a cause of lnharmony at the settle

There has been much talk here about
the matter of sending hula dancers to St.
Louis, and stormy objection to such ' a
proceeding has developed. The Territorial
Government will probably ask as a condi
tion of making an exhibit that such al
leged representation of life in Hawaii be
excluded from the grounds. . Â¦
If the World's Fair seeks things repre
sentative of the island Territory it is
welcome to all of them from a volcano's
crater to a chip of coral. But nevermore
the hula. And nevermore also the storm
of criticism from the moral folk whose
eyes were affrighted and whose ears were
amazed by the sight and sound of mat
native product for expositions.
HONOLULU,' April 30.â HaVaii's hula
dance seems doomed so far as its chance
of being a feature at the St. Louis Expo
sition is concerned. Hawaii has set her
dusky foot down and said an emphatic
"No!"

<Jeorge H. Daniels, general passenger
agent of the New York Central, left
Cleveland for this city to-night, and it
is understood that the new train will be
put on as soon as arrangements can be
made for it.
Cutting the schedule for long distance
runs has been made possible by improve
ment in the power and speed of locomo
tives. The new type has not yet been
subjected to purely speed trials, but it
Is said to be as much in advance of the
fastest type of ten years ago aa the
locomotive that used to draw the Em
pire State express was in advance of the
older type when it was built.
It is the boast of the New York Cen
tral that it holds the record for the fast
eBt mile ever made by a passenger-train.
This was when the Empire, in May. 1893,
ran a mile between Batavia and Buftalo
In thirty-two -seconds, or at the rate of
112\$ miles an hour.
When the Empire Sta.te express was
put on it was believed to be the fastest
train ih the world. Afterward It was
lour.d that the Sud express, on the Midi
Kailroad between Paris and Bordeaux,
was fasterâ at least, according to its
schedule. The Sud express made the
distance, 4S6 miles, at an average rate of
Â£4.13 miles an hour, while the running
lime of the Empire State express for 440
miles, from New York to Buffalo, is
53.33 miles an hour. It was said at the
Grand Central Station to-day, however,
that the Sud Express was never on time
and that now its speed has been reduced
to fifty miles an hour, while the Empire
has been running ever since its installa
tion, ten years ago, with rarely a loss of
a few minutes from its schedule. Â¦
It will mean the shortening of six

Mrs. S. E. Pearl of Yolo County took up
the question of protecting teachers who
are left entirely in charge of promotions
from unjust criticism from parents.
Superintendent J. H. .Strine of Los An
geles spoke on methods of obtaining a
uniform standard for promotion. He
called attention to the criticisms that were
made against the prevailing plan, but ex
pressed the belief that no system could
be devised that would work better than
the one in vogue.
"The better and higher the standard of
teachers, the less law; will be needed to
obtain the best results," said he.
Superintendent McLane of Fresno, re
ferring to the course of study, said that
it should.be general and never rigid in
its nature. In regard to, the matter of
home study, he agreed with Waterman.
McLane expressed the opinion that a
good ."pruning" of {he law in educational
matters would be of great benefit. Taking
all the laws on the subject, from the
constitution to the city ordinance, there
was such 'an overwhelming mass of re
strictions as to fairly stamp out all pos
sibility of showing one's individuality, in
one's work. . The only place where more
stringent laws would bring about a
change for the better was in the matter
of preparation for teachers.
At the same time during the first four years
no home work should be assigned, but the time
should be used In preparing the mind In such
a manner as to enable it to stand the greater
strain of the higher grades.
It (the law) cannot be changed to fit all in
dividual cases, of which many different kinds
ccme under the observation of the school su
perintendent. The thing: to do is to find the
middle way, not neglecting the law. too much,
nor being too narrow-minded, but to strike that
method which, with due respect to the law, is
yet the best and most productive of good to the
f-ch'iol in general. As far as home work is
concerned that also should be assigned with
reference to each pupil's age, health, ability,
home conditions and plans for the future,
which method would be fair to all and obtain
greatest and best results of each individual
case.
FRESNO,. May 7.^-At ,to;day'g session
of the .city and co'tinty school ""superln^

of Berkeley spoke on_ "Home Study, and
the Observances of Section 1665 of the
Political Code," calling attention to . the
danger of taking the law too literally.

Hepburn caught hold of the side of the
tug. Miss Lowe grasped his leg and both
were puued on board the tug.' The Marks
girl was picked up f rom â¢ a cushion on
which 'she floated. Arthur Marks .was
fortunate . enough to grab a piece of
wreckage and was picked up by those on
the tug. The other seven members of ;the
party were drowned, and the river is now
being dragged for their bodies. The tug
brought the rescued. to this city.
Hepburn states that he saw the lights
of the approaching tug, and thinking it
was bound straight down the river turned
to the east. When nearly abreast the
launch tlie tug suddenly turned to the
east in order to make the dock at Iron
vine, and before the launch could get out
of the way it was struck by the tug and

"If your Honor . pleases," said Meldon,
"no such statement was made. We is

Silva, Fair said, he did not appear in

denial from Attorney Meldon. - , .
"Oh, that was only a bluff," said Silva,
so Fair asserts. "I don't want. you and
will not require^ you if you will intercede
for a continuance." : .-. .

The , Times Is always pleased to note , and

family of ,. Southern California counties Into
closer, and* more harmonious relations, and
hence "takes pleasure in calling attention to
from Bakersfield, Porterville and other
communities enumerated in ; the - itinerary
of their trip Los Angeles has also-taken
a marked Interest in Bakersfield. The
Los Angeles Times editorially says:
*-Ji?,5 e ? pe i Cl ? 1 !!2i n for the S^ Francisco
excursionists will consist of five Pullman

the Santa Fe ticket men were busy mak

committee of arrangements and each ex
cursionist will wear one. They are of

tion In copper bronze letters. "San Fran-
? sco Â« E, usin e*s Men's Excursion to Ba
kersfleld. and the San Joaquin Valley.
May g to 10. 1902."
The official head of .the party, if It has
*me, wlh be Andrea Sbarboro by reason of
his position as chairman of the commit
tee of arrangements. .
j the fact that the Chamber of Commerce has
arranged for a special tralnload of Los An-
Keles people tojje run on i Wednesday next to
; Bakersfleld. where a carnival will be' in pro
gress. Until recently we have not been In the
habit of including our big northern : neighbor
in the family of Southern California counties.
| but It belongs strictly there, not only from the
; standpoint of geographical location, but also
because -its leading . Industriesâ petroleum, al
: falfa and fruitâ are similar to our*, and par
ticularly because.. as In our case, lta prosper
ity .. depends largely upon irrigation. Bakers-
Held has made a wonderful growth durins the
past couple. of years, since oil was developed
-near there. Its business men are wideawake
and are fally appreciative of the desirability
Of if.MÂ° D f J. n JÂ° touch w "h Los Angeles. By

trade. Therefore, from financial as well as
from less material reason*, it would be proper
and fitting for our Los Angeles people toTpat
ronlze the excursion. Â¦ y
The views expressed In ' the extract"
given from the Visalia Times coincide
exactly with those expressed by members
of the party who are going to make the
trip through the valley. The party em
braces a large representation of the Cali
fornia promotion committee of San Fran
cisco, which has selected for its wort the
endeavor to till up the interior with a de
sirable population as far as possible The
excursionists also represent a very larjre
share of the money that has been pledged
to help the promotion committee to carr"
out its work. Therefore the* party is ail
In favor of helping the San Joaquin Val
ley and all other sections of the: State to
secure the largest . possible "measure *>f
growth and prosperity. While the San
Francisco business men have been ar
ranging to ; put away ; work for a brief
season to" accept the cordial invitations
FAVOR THE INTERIOR.
We have. been led to believe that 'the awak
ening in San Francisco is genuine and that the
business men are In earnest in their desire to
help us populate this valley. We Invite them
to come down here in May so that they may
be supplied with facts at flrst hand and thus
be equipped. - â -.,. . . us _
There is no doubt but that the great draw
ing card of Southern California has been Us
orange groves. It would surprise; the. 1 mer
chants, real estate owners and capitalists of
San Francisco to be told that in Tulare County
we have enough orange land planted, and that
is suitable /for planting, to produce more -or
anges than ' all Southern California will ship
this year. It is no exaggeration to say that
we have In the foothill portion of Tulare
County 25,000 acres of land that will produce
as fine ' oranges as the world ever eaw. When
it is all Cultivated and In bearing 25 000 car
loads of oranges Â¦ will have to find a market

that .they can safely count on a big return
for every dollar they may invest in advertising
Tulare County. It will be possible tÂ» get
morey subscribed to " carry on the work â¢ of
attracting the attention â¢ of homeseekers for
a limited time,, out : of a spirit, of public
enterprise, but if it is to be continuous
the men who put up the money must be made
to know that they are engaged in a legiti
mate undertaking where the chances for suc
cess are great. In public meetings that may
be held In San Francisco In the future to dis
cuss the development of the Interior it will
be much better if the capitalists of that city
can act ' from - personal knowledge of the re
sources of the interior, rather than, be com
pelled to rely, upon what some one may tell
them about it. Â¦ . . â¢
We. want to convince the men who are put
tins up the money to help populate this valley
The San Joaquin Valley papers have
paid considerable attention to the comlne
of the large San Francisco parts' Ba
kersfield has set apart Friday as the San
Francisco day. Ben M. Maddox writing
1? ' h e Visalia Times, calls attention to
the fact that the journey will be made at
the time when "the orange proves will be
in bloom and the fruit in the deciduous
orchards will be large enough to convince
the visitors that no locality surpasses that
part of California in the production of
peaches, prunes, apricots and other stone
fruit*. What benefit the- valley may de
rive from the inspection of Intelligent ob
servers from San Francisco is told by
the Times as follows:
VALLEY IS PLEASED.
The excursionists will number, accord
ing to the enrollment up to noon yester
day, 103, but that number may be in
creased some to-day. The exact list can
not be very well made up, as the business
houses of the city have, generally speak

From Fresno the excursionists will go to
Madera and stop half an hour and, then
will come directly home without , stop,
with the expectation of reaching this, city
at 12:15 Sunday morning. The "ferryboat
will be held back if the train arrives late
at the Oakland mole.
The longest stop in the valley, outside
of Bakersfield. will be made at Fresno,
where the party will arrive at 12:45,p. m.,
remaining until 4 p. m. The enterprising
Chamber of Commerce of Fresno has ar
ranged to send a delegation to meet the
visitors at Porterville and conduct them
to Fresno. This delegation willbe headed
by W. N. Harris, a member of the execu
tive committee of the Fresno Chamber
of Commerce, and several members. The
invitation to visit Fresno was received
through the secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce^ W. B. Dennett. . Quite an ex
tensive effort will be made to acquaint
the party with the beauties of Fresno.
After luncheon the visitors will be taken
for a drive through "the colonies," visit
ing the most beautiful orchards and vine
yards in that section. The programme as
made up at Fresno for entertaining the
guests includes viewing the St. George's
vineyard, the Barton estate, -Roeding's
orchard of Calmyrna figs, the handsome
residences of Fresno, including also a
glimpse of Kearny avenue, which . has
upon it eleven miles of palms, evergreens
and oleanders. President John A. Neu of
the Chamber of Commerce will have
charge of entertaining and will be assisi
ed by Mayor L. O. Stevens. Â¦ "'
The Tulare Board of Trade has charge of
the reception and through its president has
appointed the following-named gentlemen a
committee to receive -and welcome the visit
ing business men: Captain Thomas H. Thomp

Hanford business men, headed by Mavor
Harry D. Widmer and D. R. Cameron
president of the Kings County Chamber
of Commerce and chairman of the execu
tive committee of the Grand Army en
campment, which is being held in Han
ford this week.
Although the excursion train bearing the
party of San Francisco business men, which
is to arrive in this city Saturday, will not re
main a sufficient length of time to permit of
the visitors being shown over the adjacent or
chards and vineyards, yet the party will be
accorded an official reception and the most
will be made of the limited opportunity to im
part a knowledge of our resources.
At 10 o'clock the train will be due at
Tulare. The correspondent of The Call

It is not to be supposed that the visitors
will spend all the day to-morrow looking
at oil wells and estimating the wealth of
the country. The Bakersfield people, ac
cording to all accounts, have been making
up a carnival that will long perpetuate
Its own fame, and much attention will be
paid to that attratrtion and to the claims
of the queen- of the carnival and to the
Joys that Bakers field holds out In festive
mood to the wayfarer. But the entire
day will be passed in eight-seeing, and
there will be enough to observe that will
be of lasting benefit to all concerned.
When the special train reaches Bakerp
field its run over the Santa. Fe lines will
end. The remainder of the journey will
be on the Southern Pacific tracks.
All day Saturday the tourists will travel
and see the country and study its pro-'
ducts and advantages and natural beau
ties. The run up through the San Joaquin
Valley under the accompanying circum
stances will be something to be remem
bered. The communities on the wav have
spared no effort to make certain that thÂ«
visitors shall Bee all there is and en

SEEING THE SIGHTS.
Several meetings of .the solid men of
San Francisco were held. J. D. Grant
was made the chairman of thÂ«5 general
committee and presided at each of the
meetings. Visiting the San Joaquin Val
ley was taken up in -an enthusiastic way.
"When the proposed- journey to the oil
metropolis began to be discussed other
communities in the valley asked that they
might be favored with a visit. When the
proceedings had advanced sufficiently to
determine that the San Francisco business
men desired to go Into the valley the en
tire arrangements were turned over to
two committees, who have since done
good work in making up the party, pro
viding the funds needed and devising a
eatfcfactory itinerary. The committee on
arrangements, headed by Andrea Sbar
boro, has already been named. The com
mittee of soliciting consisted - of Walter
M. Castle. J. P. Currier, M. Koshland, F.

Bakersfield is the battleground for
trade between the north and the
south. When the tariff of the rail
ways crossing the Tehachapl moun
tains was rearranged, . some time ago,
the territory which had been held
by reason of the bounding: lofty Teha
chapi range to be in the San Francisco
trade field for all time was thrown upon
to the even competition of the City of
the Angejs, that competition being ex
tended even farther north by the railway
tariff rates. San Francisco has been slow
to relinquish Its claim upon the firm
friendship of the upper San Joaquin Val
ley. On the other hand: Bakersfield, cor
dially acknowledging the interest It has
in San Francisco, when the carnival In
Its streets was only projected, and before
its first sray banner flared upon the air,
sent a delegation of its solid citizens to
this city to Invite the commercial bodies
to unite in using their influence to brng
about a San Francisco day in the carni
val. The Bakersfield committee met a
ready response. The Chamber of. Com
merce of San Francisco, the Manufactur
ers' and Producers' Association of Cali
fornia, the State Board of Trade, the
Board of Trade of 'San Francisco, the
Merchants' Association and the San-Fran
cisco Merchants' Exchange successfully
took action favorable to the request made
and elected delegates to attend a conven
tion for the purpose In view.
ATTRACTION IS MUTUAL.
The journey through the valley will be
a -royal one. From San Francisco,' staxt
lng at 9:20 this eVening by way of the
Santa Fe. the run to Baxersneld will be
uninterrupted. Bakersfield will be reached
at 7 a. m. to-morrow. The party- will be

if the fight for comfort during the hot season will be
waged this summer, by larger numbers. than ever.
DISPATCHES from Montgomery announce
that the first step has been taken in that city
in a movement to bring the suffrage laws of
Alabama before the courts, in order that the consti
tionality of the restrictions adopted by the ; recent
convention may be tested. A negro man of educa
tion_ and an owner of property has made an affidavit
before a notary, alleging that he has been denied the
right to register, although he is justly entitled to do
so. The dispatches do not state upon what ground
the denial of the privilege of registering was based,
but it is stated that the case will bring the whole suf
frage clause of the constitution before the court
and make a fair test of its validity. It is the inten
tion of the attorneys for the complainant to carry the
issue to the Supreme Court, of the United States as
soon as possible should they be defeated in the lower
courts.
The proposed action is much better than would
be any investigation of the Southern suffrage laws
by Congress. The people of the North desire that
justice be done in the South, and that the negroes be
upheld in the exercise of every constitutional right,
but at the same time there is profound objection to
reviving anything in the way of a sectional issue.
Whatever Congress should do in the matter would
surely be regarded as an affair of politics. It would be
discussed from partisan standpoints, and* undoubtedly
each side would try to make party capital out of it.
The evils resulting from such discussions would be
great, and it is doubtful if the benefits would be "suffi
cient to offset them. \
No such objections can be made.to an appeal to
the courts. From first to last the hearings before
the tribunals will be free from the appearance of par-
SOUTHERN SUFFRAGE LAWS.
It will be remembered that last summer a Chicago
man had his stomach removed and went home happy
in the consciousness that everybody was reading
about him and the hope that he would never have
indigestion again. Now comes a report that he has
returned to the, hospital with the intention of having
his liver removed. Evidently his desire for free ad
vertising is insatiable.
WHEN the San Francisco business men make
their tour through the San Joaquin they
will find the whole region stirring with the
life of a new spring, metaphorical as well as literal.
T.he growing grain and the budding orchards will not
show more evidence of vitality than the universal
demonstration of activity among the people. The
movement for the promotion of Northern California
is going forward in every locaiity with abundant
vigor and gives promise of producing great results in
every instance.
One of the notable evidences of the earnestness of
the people in promoting the movement is the readi
ness with which they are organizing to help the Pro
motion Committee and present the claims of their
own districts. Recently we had occasion to direct
attention to what has been done in that way by the
Board of Trade of Reedley, and it is now to be noted
that the example thus set is to be followed in other
localities. â¢
Speaking for Selma and urging the organization of
"a wide-awake Chamber of Commerce," the Fresno
County Enterprise says: "Every town in San Joaquin
Valley of any commercial importance, save our own,
supports an organization of this kind. Indeed it is
embarrassing to even suggest Selma's dereliction of
duty in this matter. The San Joaquin Valley Com
mercial Association has been laboring for months
and meeting here and there throughout the valley ad
vertising and advancing the interests of Central Cali
fornia at every session, but to this organization, and
likewise to the outside world who read its tracts and
its proceedings, Selma is unknown. Why? Because
we are without a commercial organization whose of
fice it is to make us known."
Straightforward statements of, that kind show the
spirit that is in the enterprising men of the San Joa
quin towns. The effect is certain to be excellent.
As a result of that plain speech the very next issue of
the Enterprise may have to record the beginning of
a movement to establish a Chamber of Commerce at
Selma. Organization of some kind is bound to come.
No San Joaquin community can lag in this move
ment. .Â¦>;;.:
So in the large towns and in the small ones there
is everywhere evident an intention to get together
and work for the general good by working for their
own good. The Promotion Committee can do noth
ing for a community that will not make an. effort at
least to help itself. The live, enterprising men of
every community must combine, organize and work
together to make known the resources of their lo
cality and set forth its inducements for investors and
home-seekers. Nothing can be gained in any town
by delaying such organizations. The time for action
is at hand, and those who do not take part in it will
lose by their negligence.
THE PROMOTION MOVEMENT.
DESPITE Bryan's vociferous objections the
work of reorganizing . the Democratic party
in the Eastern States goes briskly on.. In
fact, in the whole region east of the Mississippi and
north of the Ohio very little attention is paid to the
former leader or to his platform. It appears, there
fore, that if Bryan has any following at all in the
next national convention it will be a strictly sectional
one. It may, under the operation of the two-thirds
rule, prevent the nomination of a straight-out gold
standard 'man, but it certainly will not be able to
nominate Bryan himself nor any of the old Chicago
platform crowd.
The special animosity which has been displayed by
Bryan against Hill seems to preclude the possibility
that Hill will get the nomination or that he will be
able to procure the honor for any of his New* York
supporters. At the same time the Southern sup
port for Gorman has weakened, and thus there is no
prominent champion in sight to lead the reorganiz
ers to the victory which now seems certain to perch
upon their banners when the fight in the convention
takes place. This condition of affairs has given other
States a chance to put forward their favorites, and
while the West talks of Tom Johnson and Carter
Harrison there is talk in Pennsylvania of Pattison
and in Massachusetts of Olney.
Recently one of the strongest Bryan men in Penn
sylvania broke away from -his former leader and advo
cated the close alliance with the repudiators of the
Chicago platform. Bryan has repeatedly urged, his
followers to have nothing to do with the reorgan
izers, to vote for no man who objected to the plat
form and the ticket of 1896 and 1900, but the Pennsyl
vanian says: "We want them all back. We* want the
many honored Democrats who stood nobly with us
through the battles of the last forty years in Pennsyl
vania â the Hancocks, the Baers, the Farquhars, the
Myers, the Hansels, the Harritys, the Pattisons, the
Cadwaladersâ with U3, where they truly belong.
Upon every other question but that of silver we are
as one. Unhappily, because adversely settled, there
is no more silver question."
The statement "there is no more silver question"
has become a sort of cuckoo cry with the reorgan
izers. It serves them at once as argumentjor Demo
cratic harmony and as a plea why the party should re
ceive the support of conservative men. It is of course
well understood that if there be no more silver ques
tion there is no more Bryan leadership, and virtually
no more Chicago platform.
In Pennsylvania the reorganizers do not seem to
have progressed further than a "negative platform.
They repudiate free silver, but they offer no living
issue to take the place of the dead. ' It is different" in
Massachusetts. The reorganizers of that State de
clare, Richard Olney to be the natural leader of . the
party and they present him to the country on the dis
tinct and positive platform of tariff revision in the
direction of free trade.
One of Mr. Olney's supporters; at Washington re
cently discussing the political .outlook for the fall
elections said: "An organization can be effected for
the coming Congressional campaign if some of the
leaders who have not been heard from will come to
the rescue of the party. Mr. Olney is naturally and
logically the leader in a movement which will bring
together the men whose principles are to be re
adbpted, and those who left them once but who want
to come back to them. Mr. Olney's attitude in the
campaign of 1900 made him the most popular Demo
cratic leader in the East. There is no silver Demo
crat in that section of the country, or in any other,
section, who compare? with him in general popular
ity. He is in a sense, by reason of the letter which he
wrote against Mr. McKinley in the campaign of 1900,
the connecting link. between the gold Democrats and
those who went off after. Mr. Bryan."
The situation is undoubtedly promising for cither
Pattison or Olney. If they can only keep thfe Bryan
ites raging against Hill and his New York following
so as to shut those men out of any chance of winning,
the next leader of the hosts of' Democracy in a
Presidential fight may be either from Pennsylvania or
from Massachusetts.';^ >' \

A recent flood in Tennessee is said to have washed
away a wide strip of country and revealed the bury
ing gVound of a people who are supposed to have
preceded the Indians, The graves consist of vaults
formed of thin. slabs of limestone evidently brought
from some distance.' They are very narrow, and it is
believed- the bodies must have been deposited in them
sideways, but as the floods washed off every vestige
of the contents of the tombs nothing definite can be
said on the subject. The ground is to be explored
for further tombs, and science expects to make a
great discovery of new facts concerning the mound-'
builders, who are supposed to have constructed the
vaults.
i SPECIAL session of Congress, is something
l\ . more than probable. The regular business of
â¢L Vthe session that concerns the administration of
the government is well advanced and would enable
an adjournment by the middle of June. But the gen
eral legislation, and especially that part of it im
pinged upon the vexing externalities we have inher
ited from the Spanish war, is not advanced, nor can
it be said that there is any substantial agreement as
to its scope and terms.
The determined front shown by the beet sugar men
against Cuban free trade has put a long parliamentary
pause into the consideration of that, question, so that
it is doubtful if it will reach a conclusion at this ses
sion. As far as it has gone it has exposed the extreme
danger of tampering with the tariff. If free trade prove
to have a majority in the Senate it may be that the
whole subject will be permitted to die in Congress
and t lat when the new Cuban government* is installed
a treaty covering air demands will be made with it, to
be ratified by the Senate, and the House will be left
out of the matter entirely. Such'a policy will narrow
that issue down and take it out of focus as a general
Congressional question.
Then the Philippine legislation will remain. That
is arrested by the revelations that have been made to
the Senate committee. Representative Sibley and
Senator Lodge have both denounced the Herod or
der of General Smith, and have reflected generally
upon our military course/ in the islands. Mr.
Cooper of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Com
mittee on Insular Affairs, goes further than either
and intimates that if we can get and keep the. archi
pelago only by such means we don't want it at all.
All recognize legislation under the circumstances
as premature, and have fallen into a waiting spirit.
This is strengthened by the evident purpose of the
War Department to sustain Smith. As that depart
ment deals with matters that are beyond civilian
reach, and with necessities and emergencies un
known in the civil administration of the Government,
it has always been tolerated in its exclusive treatment
of them. It was this tolerance that sustained Stanton
during the Civil War, even in such extraordinary ac
tions as ordering all of Mr. Lincoln's mail sent to
him to be opened before it was seen by the Presi
dent.
Passing that by, it is beginning to be felt by all that
insular administration is going to develop matters that
Congress cannot deal with either in regular or special
session. Not only trade and tariffs, franchises and
development have to be dealt with, and instantly,
with executive energy, but the more serious questions
inhering in the disposition of the people and their
feeling toward American rule. This cannot be han
dled with a spelling-book and the four ground rules
of arithmetic, nor with the catechism from a mis
sionary standpoint, nor by Congress, torn by con
flicting sentiments, political ambitions and views of
policy.
It is a plain impossibility for Congress to have the
personal knowledge of the islands that it has of our
continental territories. These have delegates sitting
in the House who are Americans like the rest of us.
If the islands have delegates they will not be Ameri
cans. They will be Filipinos or Spaniards, with the
craft and cunning of both races and with nothing at
all in common with us. If such delegates, on the
other hand, were Americans they, would have nothing
in common with the Filipinos. In either case Con
gress would be without any proper information to
act as a common ferment in its assortment of views
and bring them all to work together toward a com
mon object.
For these reasons it is beginning to appear to the
most thoughtful and sober-minded that if we are to
have a conclusively wise and useful policy in the
islands it must be had by eliminating Congress en
tirely. The extraordinary condition must be met by
giving to the executive extraordinary powers, such as
Jefferson took to himself in ruling in Louisiana be
tween the time of its annexation and its erection into
a territory. These powers, even, must be enlarged,
inasmuch as the responsibility and issue are greater.
In the exercise of irresponsible power by army of
ficers and the Philippine Commission we have learned
its danger. There must be a common radix for civil
and military power in those distant possessions, to
the end that the American people may fix responsi
bility at one place only, if things go wrong, and sup
port that one source of power in making them go
right.
All of these things are the present under current of
opinion. It will soon become the upper current, and
whether this regular or a special session of Congress
attempt to deal with the matter on lines now in
sight, this current will control its final disposition.
tisanship. Thus the issue' can be brought to trial and
to adjudication without rousing sectional parties,
and the country will be saved from the possibility of
adisturbing element in '.national politics.
Should the Supreme Court decide that the Ala
bama suffrage restrictions are unconstitutional, the
similar restrictions in other Southern States will, of
course, fall with them. It will then be .for Congress
to take action, and having the. decision of the Su
preme Court to build upon, the action would be much
more effective than anything, that can be done now.
The refusal of the Republican leaders of the House
to press the Crumpacker resolution calling for an in
vestigation of the Southern â¢ election laws and the
suppression of the negro vote shows that they are
averse to stirring up the question at this time.' In
due season, however,' the issue will surely, come up
for settlement, for the South cannot be permitted to
suppress the negro vote and at the same" time enjoy
representation in Congress based upon the assump
tion that the negroes are voters. Such being the sit
uation, the progress of the Alabama test case through
the courts will be followed with interest, and it is to
be hoped the judges will give it the right of way on
their calendars, so that it may be speedily-adjudi
cated. ': -

THE ABBREVIATION O. K.â W." H.,
City. The letters O. K. in America sig
nify "all right." Their use is said to have
originated with Jacob Astor, the New
York millionaire. He was looked upon in
commercial circles as a man of great in
formation and of sound judgment, and he
was a sort of referee as to the solvency
or standing of other traders. If a note of
inquiry as to any trader's position came,
the answer to which he Intended to be
satisfactory, he was accustomed to write
across the note the letters O. K. and re
turn It to the writer. These letters he
jocularly said were the abbreviation gf
"all correct," and In that sense they are
now used all over the United States. To
put a 1-cent stamp on a city letter in a
place where there is a free delivery and
require the recipient of such letter to pay
1 cent postage due Is not O. K. Such let
ter, whether sealed or unsealed, requires

Royalty is honoring San Francisco with
a visit. Beautiful Queen Fay, who is to
hold court during Sacramento's Street
Fair, is at the Palace. Before she was
proclaimed queen by her loyal subjects
of Sacramento, she was Miss Fay Jack
son and as such received the flood of
votes that entitled her to a coronet.
Sacramento's young queen is chaperon
ed by Mrs. G. W. Jackson, her mother;
Mrs. N. Jackson and Mrs. G. W. Jackson.
The popularity of Miss Jackson is
shown by the fact that she received 187,
716 -votes of the 256,325 cast, a majority
of 119,107.
The royal party is here to select the
robes which the queen is to wear during
her reign. They are to be the handsom
est obtainable and the young woman who
is to wear them will indeed look a mon
arch, i â¢
No one is more suited^ to wear the pur
ple than Miss Jackson. She is a more de
cided beauty than her photographs indi
cate. She is a blonde of the rarest type,
with hair like the sunshine and dark vio
let eyes.
The young queen is full of enthusiasm
over the coming carnival. She said last
night: , - .
"No, indeed. I'm not surprised at see
ing reporters or at being asked for an
interview, because my friends at home
told me I should : surely meet some of
you and 'be asked about my plans.
* "You want to know How I feel as Queen
of Sacramento? First of all, I'm awfully
proud of my majority. Just think! I re
ceived 120,000 votes more than any one
else! It makes the selection so decisive
that I feel as if I have the good will of all
Sacramento.
THANKFITL TO FRIENDS.
"I am very, very thankful to my friends
and I shall do all in my power to make
our approaching street fair the most suc
cessful we have ever held.
"How did I happen to be a candidate?
I hadn't thought of entering the contest
and was much interested in the names of
other girl friends who had received votos,
when one morning my own name appear
ed in the paper. Some one had given me
fifty votes, and to this day I do not
know who was so kind. I took It as a
joke, and made light of it; but when suc
ceeding days disclosed other friends and
my votes were becoming numerous, 'I
yielded to the importuning of those
closest to me and decided that I should
enter the field of candidates.. You know
the result. The victory. seemed very easy
and I am happy to say there is no ill feeli
ing engendered among any element of my
townspeople. .
"Do I feel any different now? Oh. no.
Of course, I appreciate the honor and am
very grateful, but I am not unmindful of
the fact that this is all a great mock show
with lots of grandeur and no reality. I
shall do my part and try to be gracious
and queenly in the presence of my thou
sands of temporary subjects.
"My dresses and robes? Oh, yes. I'm
here to select them now. They are going
to be beautiful and we shall spare no ex
pense in making the attire queenly in all
Its details. The outer robes shall be of
the regal colors and I am to have differ
ent gowns for almost every day. They are
now being made and next Monday shall
see us all in readiness.
INVITES ALL SAN FRANCISCO.
"I want you to invite all San Francisco
in my name. I want to see you all during
my reign. Our fair Is going to eclipse
anything we have heretofore attempted.
The preparations are most elaborate, .
"Just imagine! Half a mile of conces
sions and the best, that have ever come to
this coast.
.'.'And; the electric lights! Why, they'll
dazzle you with their brilliancy! More
than 100,000 of them, I believe. Just im
agine the flood of light! - i
"And our floral parade! Ah! that is go
ing to be beautiful. Our gardens are just
overflowing with the bloom of roses, car
nations, sweet peas and, in fact, almost
every sort of 'flowering plants, and ' the
pageant is going to be simply gorgeous.
There will be nothing to equal .it any
where else in California, and I want you
all. to come and see if I am not right.
"Our beautiful arches and Corinthian
columns are in place and the myriads of
Incandescent lights are being strung along
L street, from Tenth to Fifteenth. The
magnificent Capitol building and its
grounds make a striking background, and
our scene of festivity could not be more
happily located.
"We are providing accommodations in
advance for our visitors, so that there
may be no confusion or difficulty In find
ing stopping places.
"Let me tell you finally that you will
miss a beautiful festival if you stay away
from our street fair.
"Come up and bring your friends. We
shall try to give you all a good time."
J. Wilson Cochran is either a hypocrite
or a much maligned young man. He was
arrested yesterday afternoon on a war
rant sworn, to before Judge Cabanlss
charging him with petty larceny by trick
and device. The Â¦, complaining witness is
L. F. Golder, paymaster for the American
Can Company, who alleges that on or
about August 1 last' Cochran obtained
$20 50 from him by trick and device.
Golder stated that Cochran had been
employed by the can company and was
in the habit of borrowing money from
the men and boys employed there by tell
ing them that he had a "pull." From one
boy, John Gabrielle, who earned a dollar
per day and had saved some money, he
borrowed $60 50. Cochran was discharged
from the company's service about a week
ago.
A. G. "Walton, who accompanied Golder,
stated that Cochran was a former sol
dier and came here from the Philippines
about a year ago. He lived at 502 Powell
street, where Walton also lives. He be
came a member of the Young Men's Chris
tian Association and borrowed money
from different members on the plea that
he was poor and was trying to lead a
Christian life. He also attended the First
Presbyterian Church and had so ingra
tiated himself that a week ago he was
appointed secretary of the Sunday-school.
He had also been sending flowers and
paying his addresses to a daughter of
one of the elders of the church.
Â¦WARNING FBOM THE EAST.
According to Walton, Cochran's
hypocrisy was exposed when the follow
ing letter reached this- city recently from
Philadelphia, addressed to the editor of
the Occident, the defunct organ of the
Presbyterian church in this city:
PHILADEI.PHIA, April 2, 1902.
The Editor of the Occident, San Francisco.
Cal. â My Dear Sir: I desire to warn the min
isters of the Pacific Coast against an Impostor
representing himself to be my brother under
the assumed name of Arthur H. or George H.
Cochran. He has been living off the sympa
thies of ministers for years, representing him
self to be recently converted from a dissolute
life, and is now in California. He is a hard
ened criminal and should be brought to Jus
tice. Respectfully yours,
JOSEPH W. COCHRAN,
Pastor Northminster Church, Philadelphia, Pa.
This letter led to inquiries being made
and It is claimed that the impostor,
Cochran, referred to in the letter is the
Cochran under arrest, and that he had
been borrowing money from members of
the First Presbyterian Church on the
strength of being the brother of the
clergyman in Philadelphia.
SAYS HE IS INNOCENT.
Cochran when seen after his arrest re
fused at first to talk. Finally he denied
that he knew any clergyman of the name
of Cochran in Philadelphia, and therefore
could not have represented himself as his
brother. It must, he said, be a case of
mistaken Identity. He admitted borrow
ing money from employes at the can com
pany, but said he had paid most of it
back. The company kept back his last
two weeks' wages for that purpose. : Ho
denied making advances to the daughter
of the elder of the First Presbyterian
Church, nor did he borrow any money
from members of the church. He said he
only borrowed $7 altogether from mem
bers of the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation and had not yet repaid the
amount.
"I have served two terms in the army
in the Philippines," said Cochran, "and
have received an honorable discharge
each time. I am a native of New York,
where my family resides. I had friends
here, but I - fear this sad business will
estrange them. My name is- J.-?Wilson
Cochran and I never assumed any other."
The counties of San Francisco, Marin
and San Mateo comprise the Second Rail
road District now represented by Commis
sioner C. S. Laumeister. It Is generally
understood that Laumeister ia a candi
date for renomination.
The First Equalization District is com
posed of San Francisco alone. J. G. Ed
wards was elected in 1898 to represent the
district on the State Board of Equaliza
tion, but his death occurred shortly after
his election. To fill the vacancy Gover
nor Gage appointed L. H. Brown of Ala
meda. Brown has served right along
since he was appointed to the board, al
though one general election has taken
place since the vacancy was filled by ap
pointment. In due time there will be a
full . quota of candidates for nomination
to the office. The salary attaching to the
position is 530CO per annum. The South
ern Pacific Company generally exerts all
the political influence at its command to
obtain favorable representation on thiÂ»
board. While the politicians will be open
ly and actively engaged in rounding up
delegates favorable to this or that aspi
rant for the gubernatorial nomination,
the agents of the railroad company will
be quietly, canvassing the delegates in
behalf of particular candidates for the
State Board of Equalization. No doubt
the manipulators of the Gage machine
have already slated their candidates for
the Supreme Court and the railroad and
equalization boards.
All signs point to an avalanche of inde
pendent voting at the general election
next November. In order to achieve vic
tory at the polls, the Republican State
committee must nominate men in whom
the people have implicit confidence. The
Southern Pacific this year might try the
experiment of keeping hands off. Let the
people be trusted to nominate men wha
will not combine to cinch the owners of
railway property.
Governor Odell of New York, who Is
now in Southern California, will arrive
in San Francisco next Sunday. A dinner
in his honor has been tendered by the
Union League Club. The Governor has
neither declined nor accepted the invita
tion, but he will say "yes" or "no" next
Sunday.
Mayor Schmitz goes to Vallejo thla

In Solano County. The Mayor's latest ef
fort in music is a brilliant march, com
posed since he assumed the responsibili
ties of office. In deference to the wishes
of his many friends and admirers, the
march will be published shortly. Doubt
less it will be included in the collection of
patriotic airs to be played by the band
on the occasion of the opening 1 of tho
Republican State convention at the pavil
ion in Sacramento. Â¦
Club Life, the new and exceptionally
attractive journal published by the Club
women's Guild of San Francisco and Ala
meda County, pays this tribute to tho
Mayor's new march:
It is written in a light, swinging style, very
melodious, catchy and sure to become im
mensely popular. Its title, "The Yankee Hus
tler," la intended aa a tribute to American
progress. The term "Yankee" needs no defin
ing in the realm of the stars and stripes.
"Hustler" la an Americanism universally ap
plied to any one bright, energetic, wideawake
and enterprising.

waged this summer, by larger numbers. than ever.
DISPATCHES from Montgomery announce
that the first step has been taken in that city
in a movement to bring the suffrage laws of
Alabama before the courts, in order that the consti
tionality of the restrictions adopted by the ; recent
convention may be tested. A negro man of educa
tion_ and an owner of property has made an affidavit
before a notary, alleging that he has been denied the
right to register, although he is justly entitled to do
so. The dispatches do not state upon what ground
the denial of the privilege of registering was based,
but it is stated that the case will bring the whole suf
frage clause of the constitution before the court
and make a fair test of its validity. It is the inten
tion of the attorneys for the complainant to carry the
issue to the Supreme Court, of the United States as
soon as possible should they be defeated in the lower
courts.
The proposed action is much better than would
be any investigation of the Southern suffrage laws
by Congress. The people of the North desire that
justice be done in the South, and that the negroes be
upheld in the exercise of every constitutional right,
but at the same time there is profound objection to
reviving anything in the way of a sectional issue.
Whatever Congress should do in the matter would
surely be regarded as an affair of politics. It would be
discussed from partisan standpoints, and* undoubtedly
each side would try to make party capital out of it.
The evils resulting from such discussions would be
great, and it is doubtful if the benefits would be "suffi
cient to offset them. \
No such objections can be made.to an appeal to
the courts. From first to last the hearings before
the tribunals will be free from the appearance of par-
SOUTHERN SUFFRAGE LAWS.
It will be remembered that last summer a Chicago
man had his stomach removed and went home happy
in the consciousness that everybody was reading
about him and the hope that he would never have
indigestion again. Now comes a report that he has
returned to the, hospital with the intention of having
his liver removed. Evidently his desire for free ad
vertising is insatiable.
WHEN the San Francisco business men make
their tour through the San Joaquin they
will find the whole region stirring with the
life of a new spring, metaphorical as well as literal.
T.he growing grain and the budding orchards will not
show more evidence of vitality than the universal
demonstration of activity among the people. The
movement for the promotion of Northern California
is going forward in every locaiity with abundant
vigor and gives promise of producing great results in
every instance.
One of the notable evidences of the earnestness of
the people in promoting the movement is the readi
ness with which they are organizing to help the Pro
motion Committee and present the claims of their
own districts. Recently we had occasion to direct
attention to what has been done in that way by the
Board of Trade of Reedley, and it is now to be noted
that the example thus set is to be followed in other
localities. â¢
Speaking for Selma and urging the organization of
"a wide-awake Chamber of Commerce," the Fresno
County Enterprise says: "Every town in San Joaquin
Valley of any commercial importance, save our own,
supports an organization of this kind. Indeed it is
embarrassing to even suggest Selma's dereliction of
duty in this matter. The San Joaquin Valley Com
mercial Association has been laboring for months
and meeting here and there throughout the valley ad
vertising and advancing the interests of Central Cali
fornia at every session, but to this organization, and
likewise to the outside world who read its tracts and
its proceedings, Selma is unknown. Why? Because
we are without a commercial organization whose of
fice it is to make us known."
Straightforward statements of, that kind show the
spirit that is in the enterprising men of the San Joa
quin towns. The effect is certain to be excellent.
As a result of that plain speech the very next issue of
the Enterprise may have to record the beginning of
a movement to establish a Chamber of Commerce at
Selma. Organization of some kind is bound to come.
No San Joaquin community can lag in this move
ment. .Â¦>;;.:
So in the large towns and in the small ones there
is everywhere evident an intention to get together
and work for the general good by working for their
own good. The Promotion Committee can do noth
ing for a community that will not make an. effort at
least to help itself. The live, enterprising men of
every community must combine, organize and work
together to make known the resources of their lo
cality and set forth its inducements for investors and
home-seekers. Nothing can be gained in any town
by delaying such organizations. The time for action
is at hand, and those who do not take part in it will
lose by their negligence.
THE PROMOTION MOVEMENT.
DESPITE Bryan's vociferous objections the
work of reorganizing . the Democratic party
in the Eastern States goes briskly on.. In
fact, in the whole region east of the Mississippi and
north of the Ohio very little attention is paid to the
former leader or to his platform. It appears, there
fore, that if Bryan has any following at all in the
next national convention it will be a strictly sectional
one. It may, under the operation of the two-thirds
rule, prevent the nomination of a straight-out gold
standard 'man, but it certainly will not be able to
nominate Bryan himself nor any of the old Chicago
platform crowd.
The special animosity which has been displayed by
Bryan against Hill seems to preclude the possibility
that Hill will get the nomination or that he will be
able to procure the honor for any of his New* York
supporters. At the same time the Southern sup
port for Gorman has weakened, and thus there is no
prominent champion in sight to lead the reorganiz
ers to the victory which now seems certain to perch
upon their banners when the fight in the convention
takes place. This condition of affairs has given other
States a chance to put forward their favorites, and
while the West talks of Tom Johnson and Carter
Harrison there is talk in Pennsylvania of Pattison
and in Massachusetts of Olney.
Recently one of the strongest Bryan men in Penn
sylvania broke away from -his former leader and advo
cated the close alliance with the repudiators of the
Chicago platform. Bryan has repeatedly urged, his
followers to have nothing to do with the reorgan
izers, to vote for no man who objected to the plat
form and the ticket of 1896 and 1900, but the Pennsyl
vanian says: "We want them all back. We* want the
many honored Democrats who stood nobly with us
through the battles of the last forty years in Pennsyl
vania â the Hancocks, the Baers, the Farquhars, the
Myers, the Hansels, the Harritys, the Pattisons, the
Cadwaladersâ with U3, where they truly belong.
Upon every other question but that of silver we are
as one. Unhappily, because adversely settled, there
is no more silver question."
The statement "there is no more silver question"
has become a sort of cuckoo cry with the reorgan
izers. It serves them at once as argumentjor Demo
cratic harmony and as a plea why the party should re
ceive the support of conservative men. It is of course
well understood that if there be no more silver ques
tion there is no more Bryan leadership, and virtually
no more Chicago platform.
In Pennsylvania the reorganizers do not seem to
have progressed further than a "negative platform.
They repudiate free silver, but they offer no living
issue to take the place of the dead. ' It is different" in
Massachusetts. The reorganizers of that State de
clare, Richard Olney to be the natural leader of . the
party and they present him to the country on the dis
tinct and positive platform of tariff revision in the
direction of free trade.
One of Mr. Olney's supporters; at Washington re
cently discussing the political .outlook for the fall
elections said: "An organization can be effected for
the coming Congressional campaign if some of the
leaders who have not been heard from will come to
the rescue of the party. Mr. Olney is naturally and
logically the leader in a movement which will bring
together the men whose principles are to be re
adbpted, and those who left them once but who want
to come back to them. Mr. Olney's attitude in the
campaign of 1900 made him the most popular Demo
cratic leader in the East. There is no silver Demo
crat in that section of the country, or in any other,
section, who compare? with him in general popular
ity. He is in a sense, by reason of the letter which he
wrote against Mr. McKinley in the campaign of 1900,
the connecting link. between the gold Democrats and
those who went off after. Mr. Bryan."
The situation is undoubtedly promising for cither
Pattison or Olney. If they can only keep thfe Bryan
ites raging against Hill and his New York following
so as to shut those men out of any chance of winning,
the next leader of the hosts of' Democracy in a
Presidential fight may be either from Pennsylvania or
from Massachusetts.';^ >' \

A recent flood in Tennessee is said to have washed
away a wide strip of country and revealed the bury
ing gVound of a people who are supposed to have
preceded the Indians, The graves consist of vaults
formed of thin. slabs of limestone evidently brought
from some distance.' They are very narrow, and it is
believed- the bodies must have been deposited in them
sideways, but as the floods washed off every vestige
of the contents of the tombs nothing definite can be
said on the subject. The ground is to be explored
for further tombs, and science expects to make a
great discovery of new facts concerning the mound-'
builders, who are supposed to have constructed the
vaults.
i SPECIAL session of Congress, is something
l\ . more than probable. The regular business of
â¢L Vthe session that concerns the administration of
the government is well advanced and would enable
an adjournment by the middle of June. But the gen
eral legislation, and especially that part of it im
pinged upon the vexing externalities we have inher
ited from the Spanish war, is not advanced, nor can
it be said that there is any substantial agreement as
to its scope and terms.
The determined front shown by the beet sugar men
against Cuban free trade has put a long parliamentary
pause into the consideration of that, question, so that
it is doubtful if it will reach a conclusion at this ses
sion. As far as it has gone it has exposed the extreme
danger of tampering with the tariff. If free trade prove
to have a majority in the Senate it may be that the
whole subject will be permitted to die in Congress
and t lat when the new Cuban government* is installed
a treaty covering air demands will be made with it, to
be ratified by the Senate, and the House will be left
out of the matter entirely. Such'a policy will narrow
that issue down and take it out of focus as a general
Congressional question.
Then the Philippine legislation will remain. That
is arrested by the revelations that have been made to
the Senate committee. Representative Sibley and
Senator Lodge have both denounced the Herod or
der of General Smith, and have reflected generally
upon our military course/ in the islands. Mr.
Cooper of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Com
mittee on Insular Affairs, goes further than either
and intimates that if we can get and keep the. archi
pelago only by such means we don't want it at all.
All recognize legislation under the circumstances
as premature, and have fallen into a waiting spirit.
This is strengthened by the evident purpose of the
War Department to sustain Smith. As that depart
ment deals with matters that are beyond civilian
reach, and with necessities and emergencies un
known in the civil administration of the Government,
it has always been tolerated in its exclusive treatment
of them. It was this tolerance that sustained Stanton
during the Civil War, even in such extraordinary ac
tions as ordering all of Mr. Lincoln's mail sent to
him to be opened before it was seen by the Presi
dent.
Passing that by, it is beginning to be felt by all that
insular administration is going to develop matters that
Congress cannot deal with either in regular or special
session. Not only trade and tariffs, franchises and
development have to be dealt with, and instantly,
with executive energy, but the more serious questions
inhering in the disposition of the people and their
feeling toward American rule. This cannot be han
dled with a spelling-book and the four ground rules
of arithmetic, nor with the catechism from a mis
sionary standpoint, nor by Congress, torn by con
flicting sentiments, political ambitions and views of
policy.
It is a plain impossibility for Congress to have the
personal knowledge of the islands that it has of our
continental territories. These have delegates sitting
in the House who are Americans like the rest of us.
If the islands have delegates they will not be Ameri
cans. They will be Filipinos or Spaniards, with the
craft and cunning of both races and with nothing at
all in common with us. If such delegates, on the
other hand, were Americans they, would have nothing
in common with the Filipinos. In either case Con
gress would be without any proper information to
act as a common ferment in its assortment of views
and bring them all to work together toward a com
mon object.
For these reasons it is beginning to appear to the
most thoughtful and sober-minded that if we are to
have a conclusively wise and useful policy in the
islands it must be had by eliminating Congress en
tirely. The extraordinary condition must be met by
giving to the executive extraordinary powers, such as
Jefferson took to himself in ruling in Louisiana be
tween the time of its annexation and its erection into
a territory. These powers, even, must be enlarged,
inasmuch as the responsibility and issue are greater.
In the exercise of irresponsible power by army of
ficers and the Philippine Commission we have learned
its danger. There must be a common radix for civil
and military power in those distant possessions, to
the end that the American people may fix responsi
bility at one place only, if things go wrong, and sup
port that one source of power in making them go
right.
All of these things are the present under current of
opinion. It will soon become the upper current, and
whether this regular or a special session of Congress
attempt to deal with the matter on lines now in
sight, this current will control its final disposition.
tisanship. Thus the issue' can be brought to trial and
to adjudication without rousing sectional parties,
and the country will be saved from the possibility of
adisturbing element in '.national politics.
Should the Supreme Court decide that the Ala
bama suffrage restrictions are unconstitutional, the
similar restrictions in other Southern States will, of
course, fall with them. It will then be .for Congress
to take action, and having the. decision of the Su
preme Court to build upon, the action would be much
more effective than anything, that can be done now.
The refusal of the Republican leaders of the House
to press the Crumpacker resolution calling for an in
vestigation of the Southern â¢ election laws and the
suppression of the negro vote shows that they are
averse to stirring up the question at this time.' In
due season, however,' the issue will surely, come up
for settlement, for the South cannot be permitted to
suppress the negro vote and at the same" time enjoy
representation in Congress based upon the assump
tion that the negroes are voters. Such being the sit
uation, the progress of the Alabama test case through
the courts will be followed with interest, and it is to
be hoped the judges will give it the right of way on
their calendars, so that it may be speedily-adjudi
cated. ': -

Royalty is honoring San Francisco with
a visit. Beautiful Queen Fay, who is to
hold court during Sacramento's Street
Fair, is at the Palace. Before she was
proclaimed queen by her loyal subjects
of Sacramento, she was Miss Fay Jack
son and as such received the flood of
votes that entitled her to a coronet.
Sacramento's young queen is chaperon
ed by Mrs. G. W. Jackson, her mother;
Mrs. N. Jackson and Mrs. G. W. Jackson.
The popularity of Miss Jackson is
shown by the fact that she received 187,
716 -votes of the 256,325 cast, a majority
of 119,107.
The royal party is here to select the
robes which the queen is to wear during
her reign. They are to be the handsom
est obtainable and the young woman who
is to wear them will indeed look a mon
arch, i â¢
No one is more suited^ to wear the pur
ple than Miss Jackson. She is a more de
cided beauty than her photographs indi
cate. She is a blonde of the rarest type,
with hair like the sunshine and dark vio
let eyes.
The young queen is full of enthusiasm
over the coming carnival. She said last
night: , - .
"No, indeed. I'm not surprised at see
ing reporters or at being asked for an
interview, because my friends at home
told me I should : surely meet some of
you and 'be asked about my plans.
* "You want to know How I feel as Queen
of Sacramento? First of all, I'm awfully
proud of my majority. Just think! I re
ceived 120,000 votes more than any one
else! It makes the selection so decisive
that I feel as if I have the good will of all
Sacramento.
THANKFITL TO FRIENDS.
"I am very, very thankful to my friends
and I shall do all in my power to make
our approaching street fair the most suc
cessful we have ever held.
"How did I happen to be a candidate?
I hadn't thought of entering the contest
and was much interested in the names of
other girl friends who had received votos,
when one morning my own name appear
ed in the paper. Some one had given me
fifty votes, and to this day I do not
know who was so kind. I took It as a
joke, and made light of it; but when suc
ceeding days disclosed other friends and
my votes were becoming numerous, 'I
yielded to the importuning of those
closest to me and decided that I should
enter the field of candidates.. You know
the result. The victory. seemed very easy
and I am happy to say there is no ill feeli
ing engendered among any element of my
townspeople. .
"Do I feel any different now? Oh. no.
Of course, I appreciate the honor and am
very grateful, but I am not unmindful of
the fact that this is all a great mock show
with lots of grandeur and no reality. I
shall do my part and try to be gracious
and queenly in the presence of my thou
sands of temporary subjects.
"My dresses and robes? Oh, yes. I'm
here to select them now. They are going
to be beautiful and we shall spare no ex
pense in making the attire queenly in all
Its details. The outer robes shall be of
the regal colors and I am to have differ
ent gowns for almost every day. They are
now being made and next Monday shall
see us all in readiness.
INVITES ALL SAN FRANCISCO.
"I want you to invite all San Francisco
in my name. I want to see you all during
my reign. Our fair Is going to eclipse
anything we have heretofore attempted.
The preparations are most elaborate, .
"Just imagine! Half a mile of conces
sions and the best, that have ever come to
this coast.
.'.'And; the electric lights! Why, they'll
dazzle you with their brilliancy! More
than 100,000 of them, I believe. Just im
agine the flood of light! - i
"And our floral parade! Ah! that is go
ing to be beautiful. Our gardens are just
overflowing with the bloom of roses, car
nations, sweet peas and, in fact, almost
every sort of 'flowering plants, and ' the
pageant is going to be simply gorgeous.
There will be nothing to equal .it any
where else in California, and I want you
all. to come and see if I am not right.
"Our beautiful arches and Corinthian
columns are in place and the myriads of
Incandescent lights are being strung along
L street, from Tenth to Fifteenth. The
magnificent Capitol building and its
grounds make a striking background, and
our scene of festivity could not be more
happily located.
"We are providing accommodations in
advance for our visitors, so that there
may be no confusion or difficulty In find
ing stopping places.
"Let me tell you finally that you will
miss a beautiful festival if you stay away
from our street fair.
"Come up and bring your friends. We
shall try to give you all a good time."
J. Wilson Cochran is either a hypocrite
or a much maligned young man. He was
arrested yesterday afternoon on a war
rant sworn, to before Judge Cabanlss
charging him with petty larceny by trick
and device. The Â¦, complaining witness is
L. F. Golder, paymaster for the American
Can Company, who alleges that on or
about August 1 last' Cochran obtained
$20 50 from him by trick and device.
Golder stated that Cochran had been
employed by the can company and was
in the habit of borrowing money from
the men and boys employed there by tell
ing them that he had a "pull." From one
boy, John Gabrielle, who earned a dollar
per day and had saved some money, he
borrowed $60 50. Cochran was discharged
from the company's service about a week
ago.
A. G. "Walton, who accompanied Golder,
stated that Cochran was a former sol
dier and came here from the Philippines
about a year ago. He lived at 502 Powell
street, where Walton also lives. He be
came a member of the Young Men's Chris
tian Association and borrowed money
from different members on the plea that
he was poor and was trying to lead a
Christian life. He also attended the First
Presbyterian Church and had so ingra
tiated himself that a week ago he was
appointed secretary of the Sunday-school.
He had also been sending flowers and
paying his addresses to a daughter of
one of the elders of the church.
Â¦WARNING FBOM THE EAST.
According to Walton, Cochran's
hypocrisy was exposed when the follow
ing letter reached this- city recently from
Philadelphia, addressed to the editor of
the Occident, the defunct organ of the
Presbyterian church in this city:
PHILADEI.PHIA, April 2, 1902.
The Editor of the Occident, San Francisco.
Cal. â My Dear Sir: I desire to warn the min
isters of the Pacific Coast against an Impostor
representing himself to be my brother under
the assumed name of Arthur H. or George H.
Cochran. He has been living off the sympa
thies of ministers for years, representing him
self to be recently converted from a dissolute
life, and is now in California. He is a hard
ened criminal and should be brought to Jus
tice. Respectfully yours,
JOSEPH W. COCHRAN,
Pastor Northminster Church, Philadelphia, Pa.
This letter led to inquiries being made
and It is claimed that the impostor,
Cochran, referred to in the letter is the
Cochran under arrest, and that he had
been borrowing money from members of
the First Presbyterian Church on the
strength of being the brother of the
clergyman in Philadelphia.
SAYS HE IS INNOCENT.
Cochran when seen after his arrest re
fused at first to talk. Finally he denied
that he knew any clergyman of the name
of Cochran in Philadelphia, and therefore
could not have represented himself as his
brother. It must, he said, be a case of
mistaken Identity. He admitted borrow
ing money from employes at the can com
pany, but said he had paid most of it
back. The company kept back his last
two weeks' wages for that purpose. : Ho
denied making advances to the daughter
of the elder of the First Presbyterian
Church, nor did he borrow any money
from members of the church. He said he
only borrowed $7 altogether from mem
bers of the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation and had not yet repaid the
amount.
"I have served two terms in the army
in the Philippines," said Cochran, "and
have received an honorable discharge
each time. I am a native of New York,
where my family resides. I had friends
here, but I - fear this sad business will
estrange them. My name is- J.-?Wilson
Cochran and I never assumed any other."
The counties of San Francisco, Marin
and San Mateo comprise the Second Rail
road District now represented by Commis
sioner C. S. Laumeister. It Is generally
understood that Laumeister ia a candi
date for renomination.
The First Equalization District is com
posed of San Francisco alone. J. G. Ed
wards was elected in 1898 to represent the
district on the State Board of Equaliza
tion, but his death occurred shortly after
his election. To fill the vacancy Gover
nor Gage appointed L. H. Brown of Ala
meda. Brown has served right along
since he was appointed to the board, al
though one general election has taken
place since the vacancy was filled by ap
pointment. In due time there will be a
full . quota of candidates for nomination
to the office. The salary attaching to the
position is 530CO per annum. The South
ern Pacific Company generally exerts all
the political influence at its command to
obtain favorable representation on thiÂ»
board. While the politicians will be open
ly and actively engaged in rounding up
delegates favorable to this or that aspi
rant for the gubernatorial nomination,
the agents of the railroad company will
be quietly, canvassing the delegates in
behalf of particular candidates for the
State Board of Equalization. No doubt
the manipulators of the Gage machine
have already slated their candidates for
the Supreme Court and the railroad and
equalization boards.
All signs point to an avalanche of inde
pendent voting at the general election
next November. In order to achieve vic
tory at the polls, the Republican State
committee must nominate men in whom
the people have implicit confidence. The
Southern Pacific this year might try the
experiment of keeping hands off. Let the
people be trusted to nominate men wha
will not combine to cinch the owners of
railway property.
Governor Odell of New York, who Is
now in Southern California, will arrive
in San Francisco next Sunday. A dinner
in his honor has been tendered by the
Union League Club. The Governor has
neither declined nor accepted the invita
tion, but he will say "yes" or "no" next
Sunday.
Mayor Schmitz goes to Vallejo thla

In Solano County. The Mayor's latest ef
fort in music is a brilliant march, com
posed since he assumed the responsibili
ties of office. In deference to the wishes
of his many friends and admirers, the
march will be published shortly. Doubt
less it will be included in the collection of
patriotic airs to be played by the band
on the occasion of the opening 1 of tho
Republican State convention at the pavil
ion in Sacramento. Â¦
Club Life, the new and exceptionally
attractive journal published by the Club
women's Guild of San Francisco and Ala
meda County, pays this tribute to tho
Mayor's new march:
It is written in a light, swinging style, very
melodious, catchy and sure to become im
mensely popular. Its title, "The Yankee Hus
tler," la intended aa a tribute to American
progress. The term "Yankee" needs no defin
ing in the realm of the stars and stripes.
"Hustler" la an Americanism universally ap
plied to any one bright, energetic, wideawake
and enterprising.

Norton also submitted a report as to the
condition of ferry slips Nos. 2, 3 and 4, and
also as to the dolphins between the slips. He
reported that the piles were badly eaten by
the llmnorla, and estimated the cost for re

that the dolphins between the slips be made
on a more permanent foundation than piles.
The repairs suggested, Norton said, would en

Notice to Passengers.
Efforts' are being made, however, to keep
the matter as secret as possible because of the
opposition which has been stirred up abroad
and which might arise here in case the facts
were known In retard to the ownership of the
steamshfc? companies. . . ?
It U admitted In well-informed circles that
It la Dlanned to make the ocean lines feeders
to the largest railroad transportation companies
of the United States, so that It will be poss -
ble to control rates from the principal Interior
points of this country to leadlns European
centers.
Several lance' railroad companies, supposed
to be Eastern trunk lines, are represented in
the underwriting syndicate for $50,000,000,
which has Just been formed to jcuarantee the
success of the steamshlD deal, and these are
supposed to be the Pennsylvania, New York
Central. Erie, Reading and Baltimore and
Ohio, althoueh there ia some doubt whether all
of these will come In.
In resrard to the railroads, it should be said
that their Interest in the underwriting
does not necessarily lmsly that they have
officially subscribed as yet to the syndicate,
but subscriptions have been offered which are
Intended for them-, and those who have taken
them are agents for the railroads.
NEW YORK, May 7.â The Evening Post
says to-day that a dispatch to that paper
from London â¢ to J the effect that some of
the large American railroads are to be
the principal owners of the steamship
combination was confirmed to-day In

We will loan you the money for a regular banking
rate of interest â six per cent. And you can pay us
back little by little in unfelt amounts. Then you can
go to one of the first-class furniture stores, with whom
we have made special arrangements, where the stock is
big and fresh and where satisfaction' is certain, and
when-you have made your selection you can pay your
bill in full with good, hard cash. -
. Isn't this better than buying in the installment stores
.V. and being compelled to select your goods from smaller
and inferior stocks?
The installment stores charge you ten per cent
â¢ above their cash prices when you ask for long credit.
All you pay us is six per cent.
â¢ For example: If your purchases amount to $100.00
t we will charge you $106.00â which is a six per cent
advance; then you pay us $20.00 cash and the balance
in monthly payments amounting to $8.60 each month.
If your purchases amount to $75.00 we will charge you
$7950; you make us a cash payment on this of $15.00
and pay the balance at the easy rate of $6.45 pe. r
You save four per cent. You have the great privi-
lege of buying in a first-class store, and yet you get
all the advantages of the easy payment plan as offered
by the installment houses!
No amount of money is too small for us to loan.
â¢ Worth looking into, don't you think?

Exhaastion of Nerre Force Is
Common in Springtime.
Paine's Celery
Compound
Banishes
Nervous Prostration, Hysteria,
and Sleeplessness.
Any intelligent man or woman can eas-
ily detect victims of. nervous troubles by
taking a ten-minute walk on any cf tha
crowded streets of our cities or towns.
The observer will note countenances full
of feverish anxiety, harassed looks, un-
steady - hands, faltering steps, twitching
muscles, pallid faces and startled, anxiouj
looks when unusual noises are made.
Such people are. without doubt, victims
of nervous prostration, hysteria or insom-
nia. The whole system suffersâ the brain,
the spinal cord and the sympathetic sys-
tem.
It is unnecessary to dilate minutely on
the causes of nervousness. Business
cares and disappointments, haste after
riches and honors, social and household
worries, sexual and alcoholic excesses,
watching and anxiety and loss of near
and dear ones, all contribute to tha
breaking down of the nervous organism
of men and women.
In earnest words we set before this af-
flicted class the truth that Paine's Celery
Compound affords a speedy and sure cure
for all forms of nervous diseases. Tha
great medicine is a perfect restorer of
nerve force and power; a sure builder and
strengthener of the weak and debilitated
system. ' â¢
Paine's Celery Compound has enabled
thousands in every city and town of oxjr
land to renew and Invigorate their health
and keep their places in business and m
society. In all large centers where nerv-
ous diseases are common the best Phy-
sicians prescribe Paine's Celery Com-
pound with continued success.
A few bottles of nature's health re-
storer used during the month of May will
completely banish all nervous disorders
by giving new nerve force, purer blood,
better digestion, normal appetite and re-
freshing sleep. In a word. Paine's Celery
Compound will give you the full powers
of robust manhood and true womanhood.

pigeons, the live-bird shoot on May 9 for
cash prizes, announced by the Union Gun
Club of this place, will have to be modi

will be arranged accordingly.

Jimmic Little put up a game battle

Dan Barry was palpably fouled by Al
Young in the second round of their fight.
Referee Hayes gave the contest to Young
because he did not see the foul blow de
livered. The police stopped this bout also.
fcTed Landers entered the ring with
Otto Knoch. The latter was strong and

right on the jaw that made him see stars'.
"Young" Wolff, an awkward boxer with

Fred Belango and Lew Powell swung
their fists like flails for four rounds. Both
were novices at the game of hit and get

lacked strength. Powell was given the
decision for his aggressive work.

Only stopping to discard his coat and

BASEBALL NOTES.
Anderson leads the league in batting
with an average of more than 390.
It looks as though Oakland is raising
another crop of cripples. The season is
but a month old. yet Dunleavy and Mc-
Creedie are in the Hospital class.
, We have the cheery voice of Jack
O'Connell here this week, while Jim Mc-
Donald goes to the capital to give the
Senators a square deal in their uphill
struggle.
Rube Waddell blossomed out as a sec
ond baseman again yesterday and did
faultless work. Rube will turn umpire
after he has caught a game or two and
then he can retire on a pension.
The Angels failed to steal a single base
on old St. Peter. Perhaps Pete makes a
few unnecessary kicks sometimes, but he
is In the game when needed.
Dr. Mosklman was on the Oakland
bench and ready to so to it had his ser
vices been needed. The Doc is still unfit
to play ball and will need a couple of
â¢weeks in which to put himself right.
Hannivan hit a hot liner to Francks In
the ninth and Buck fumbled the ball and
then fell down. He recovered, but made
a bad throw to first and the scorer gave
Hannivan a bit. It was a hard chance
and the decision seems lust.
Hannivan was the only player in yes
terday's game to get more than one hit.
Not a single man made first base on an
error, something that does not happen
more than a couple of times In an entire
season. This is what a scientist would
call perfect ball tossing.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON. May 7.â As an act of
courtesy to the Cuban 'Government, Sec
retary of the Navy Moody has ordered the
armored cruiser Brooklyn to proceed to
Havana and salute the flag of the repub
lic when it is hoisted over Moro Castle
on May 20. ]
When the ceremonies of turning over
the government to President Palma are
completed the cruiser will receive Gover
nor General Wood and his staff and will
sail out of Havana harbor. With her dis
appearance will go the last vestige of
American sovereignty over the Island.
The decision to send the Brooklyn was
reached after a conference between the
President, Secretary Moody and Secretary
Root. The assignment of the Brooklyn
is particularly felicitous, in view of her
participation in the battle of Santiago
which brought about Cuban freedom.
The Brooklyn will go to Cuba under
command of Captain C. M. Thomas. Some
consideration was given to the idea of
ordering the entire North Atlantic squad
ron to Havana, but the necessity of hav
ing ' Rear. Admiral Hinginson's command
meet the French battleship Gaulois pre
vented its adoption. It was suggested to
day that an officer of the grade of rear
admiral may be ordered to hoist his flag
on the Brooklyn, but it is not believed this
will be done. It Is expected that the War
Department will issue a statement in a
few days setting forth the programme of
evacuation.

PHILADELPHIA TAKES A
GAME FROM BALTIMORE
The v annual" benefit' of San Francisco
Lodge. No. 3, B. P. O. Elks, takes place
at the " Grand '"Opera-house on 'â¢ Tuesday
evening, May 20, when a particularly in
teresting programme will . be â¢ offered, the
talent including . Edward Harrigan and a
"Fid3le Dee Dee" Is "still turning, crowds
away from Fischer's ; Theater and is evi
dently In for; another month's run.. The
show Is kept up to the minute In the mat
ter of songs and jokes, and is, to begin
with, asL funny. as they make them. There
aas perhaps never before been produced
in San Francisco another piece ' that
comes ' as near as "Fiddle: Dee Dee" to
keeping an audience ; in a * continual roar
from the time the curtain goes up until
it falls on? the last act. -The players are
all first-class. -
"Mrs. Partington" is crowding the Cen
tral Theater with appreciative audiences
every \ evening. James Corrigan as the
celebrated mother of a famous son is
: fully up to the requirements of the role,
and is excellently supported In its lavish
hilarity by the Central, farceurs. James
Home as Ike Is.good, and Will- H. Bray,
thÂ« latest addition -.to the company, made
a hit as the stammering deacon. The bill
for next week will .be - a thrilling melo
drama, "The World."
"When the Heart. Was" Young," the new
rural drama at the Alcazar Theater, will
give way next week to an amusing so
ciety comedy, new here, . by name "Lost
Twenty-four Hours." It is said to have
had a considerable success in New York.
The story deals with the customary mat
rimonial complications, handled in a new
and entertaining manner, and the fun is
of the fast and furious order The man
agement has a splendid treat In store for
its patrons, in the farce comedy hit, "The
Brixton Burglary," that has made good
in London and New York.
"The Leather Patch" at the Grand
Opera-house is making much fun for its
patrons. Mr. Harrigan as Jere McCarthy
is as funny a creation as was ever seen
on the local or any other stage. The
house company is filling in the broadly
farcical parts as If they had never done
anything else, and the whole performance
ia going with a snap and vim that could
not . be bettered. As an example of the
older comedies upon which' rests most of
the modern farce comedy, /'The Leather
Patch" should not be, missed. Not that
it is not- very much worth while for Its
own sake. "Reilly and the 400"/ will be
next week's bill.
The NelU company is giving "Under the
Red Robe" this week. It is not the best
thing in the / Neill repertoire, but has
drawn good houses in spite of that. Next
Sunday evening the company will produce
Bronson Howard's society drama, "Aris
tocracy," which made a very favorable
impression at the Baldwin some years
ago. Faversham Is said to have made
his first score in the part of the princely
villain, a role that will be played here by
Clifford Demps"ey, who Is acting the bad
man this season with much eclat. Mr.
Neill will play the amateur rich Callfor
nlan, whose struggles to gÂ«t into society
cause all the trouble.
"The Singing Girl,'-' as given by the
clever company up at the Tivoll, is one of
the hits of the week and season. More
musical than "The Fortune Teller," and
with as much rollicking fun as "The Ser
enade," it bids fair to be of the record
makers at the popular opera-house. An
nie Myers and Edward Webb as the sing
ing girl and her brother are as clever
and tuneful a comedy couple as one could
desire, and Hartman is seen in a role that
shows him in very effective light. Fran
ces Graham looks stunning as the Count
ess, and sings the part sweetly, and Cun
ningham and Gordon contribute heavily
to the musical end of things. The opera
is handsomely staged,' and some of the
ensembles are worth going miles to hear.
Nat Goodwin and Maxine Elliott will
appear in "When We. Were Twenty-one"
at the Columbia Theater to-night, Friday
and Saturday nights. At the matinee on
Saturday, "An American Citizen" will be
presented.
The performance at the Columbia .The
ater will begin at 1:30 o'clock and con
tinue until after. 5 p. m. The programme
is such a long and varied one that there
will be no Intermissions and no encores.
The best the local theaters can. present
will be seen during the entertainment.
The Actors' Home opens on Staten Isl
and, New York, to-day. The dedicatory
exercises will begin at 3 o'clock. At that
hour in this " city Mr. Nobles will read
telegrams from Mayor Low, Joseph Jef

LOS ANGELES, May 7.â Jeffries said
to-night that his position with reference
to meeting Fitzslmmons is the same as he
has held for the past three v/eeks. He ls
willing to meet the Cornlshman before the
club which offers the best inducements.
It is not likely he will agree to a contest
prior to July 4, as he will require fully
that much time in which to train. He and
his^brother Jack are doing some work at
the Jeffries' home place in this city.

OAKLAND.
McCreedie and Dunleavy were laid up
with slight injuries, so Cristall and Gor
ton were forced to watch the outfield for
stray high balls. Both delivered the
goods, and. strange to say, Walters, the
regular fielder, did not get a chance.
Schmidt pitched good ball throughout and
Lohman threw out every Angel who- had
the front to butt down in the direction of
the second pillow. Hannivan was a won
der both in the field and with the club.
The score:
If Hannivan had let Streib' s foul go, the
ending might have been different, it was
clearly a foul ball and Hannivan surely
knew that he did not have a chance to
throw a fast man like Mohler out at the
plate from an outfield fly. Then if he did
let it go, Oakland still had two chances
and it was dollars to doughnuts they
would have beat the southerners to it
anyhow.
Schmidt soaked the ball along the third
base line for two cushions and it set the
crowd wild. 'Walters laid down a pretty
bunt, which sent the smiling one to third.
Little Mohler dropped a contemptible little
single back of the mighty Hubs and the
score was aces up. Mohler immediately
pilfered second and took third on Ander
son's bad throw, the only error of the
game. Streib fouled to Hannivan in left
left and the tiny g-uardian of Oakland's
second sack was on the spot with the tally
which counted most.
The'eighth and halt 01 the ninth passed
â¢without incident or accident and the Im
patient fans did a hot toot to the exit,
saying there was nothing to it. It did
look bad for the commuters, but just then
the cads dropped, and Peter, who always
likes to dump the favorites, whispered
into Schmidt's ear and the pitcher seemed
to take the hunch.
Jones had the champs in the right place
until, the ninth. He only allowed two hits
and did not issue a single complimentary.
Not an error marred the play until Ander
son ma.de a bad throw in the linal set
io, and from a scientific point of view
the game would pass in the dark. Mohler,
Francks and Streib were there with the
usual double plays and Hannlvan was the
main guy in ieit territory, accepting no
less than eight chances, and none ot them
were easy.
Householder scored the only point for
the Angels in the seventh. He took one
of Schmidt's free passes, and while old
Peter was letting a ball glide through his
mitts landed at second. Anderson made
Morley's heart do a throbbing stunt with
a pretty drive to left rield, which put
Home kun Kddie over the last Jump.
It was an cld-time Garrison finish that
put Ewlng-s high art'talent on the sunny
elde of the 2 to 1 wind-up yesterday after
noon at the Oakland grounds. The game
could hardly be called fast, for if the
lightning express appeared on that Oak
land diamond it would look like a traction
engine going up hill. The finish was the
only part of the struggle which looked
good to the eyes of the critical observer.
It certainly was the goods.
He is . accompanied by his wife and
5-year-old son and by Clark Ball and Sol
dier Tom,\Wilson. Mr./ Ball, who is his
brother-in-law, having married Mrs. Fitz
simmons' sister, ls his manager. The sol
dier boy is his latest sparring partner.
Fitz is here to make a match with Jef
fries and will remain on the coast until
the fight takes place or until he finds he
and Jeffries cannot agree on a meeting.
This latter contingency seems remote, as
both men are, apparently, anxious for a
fight and no difficulty should .be experi
enced in bringing them together.
Little time will be lost, as Fitz ex
presses himself as being prepared to open
negotiations this morning. It is not . dif
ficulty to see he favors this city and the
prophets who have been saying' the
heavyweights -would meet here. early in
July are probably not for out of - line.
This city and Los are the only
two places on the coast which could pro
mote so big a fight on a paying basis. It
ls doubtful If the Southern California pro
moters can again be stirred up to the
point of offering a $30,000 purse.
Fitz's new sparring partner is a pictur
esque addition to the ranks of the boxers.
He is a private in the United States army
and is at present on a three months' fur
lough. He was to have gone to England
to fight a man selected from the English
army during coronation week. This fall
ing through, he accepted an invitation to
come "West with the Fitzslmmons party.
He weighs 212 pounds, but does not show
it. being trimly built.
Fitz's first evening in town was spent
quietly. He played a few games of pool
and made a frlnedly. call on Nat Goodwin,
the actor, in his dressing-room. He re
tired to his apartments in the Langham
at an early hour.
Robert Fitzslmmons, challenger for the
heavyweight boxing championship .of. the
world, arrived here yesterday from New
York, looking fresh and vigorous and the
picture of health. . .

with the, Board of Supervisors for the ap
propriation of $12,220 as the expenses of
the emergency hospitals throughout the

patients coming in, he only asks $1200 more
than appropriated last year. Dr. , Bun
nell also suggests the establishment of an
emergency hospital for the Potrero.dis
trict. Tills has long been an urgent need
and the doctor asks the board to seriously
consider it. The cost of such a structure
would probably reach 510,000.

The constructive movement aims to secure

and co-operation and acslfit in the upbuilding
of the State by means of great public policies.
The movement is turning out to be unexpect
edly 6trong in all parts of the State and among
all classes of people. Its leaders are very 6an
guine that the questions it is presenting will
beccme leading issues in politics this year, and
that they will be able to secure an important
following in the Legislature. They are work
ing on non-partisan lines,' but at the proper
time wBl give their Indorsement to candidates
pledged to these measures.
The Constructive League asks for the sub
mission of a constitutional amendment to per
mit the State to make a practical .experiment
in colonization aJong New Zealand lines.
The Constructive League demands the com
plete abolition of private monopoly In water.
It favors a comprehensive system of public
works, built by state and nation, the. water

There is every reason to believe the ;jiatlon
wfU lend its assistance, not only In making
preliminary investigations for .such a system
of public works, but also in building storage
reservoirs upon the headwaters of navigable
Ftreams. It can legitimclely do ..this as a part
of our established policy of river control. Thus
Â¦we shall get help from the national treasury

the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys. But
we cannot depend upon this source alone. The

must be supplemented by a State system' of
construction and administration.

Burton followed with a warm \ de
fense of the Government's policy in the
Philippines and became involved in a
heated colloquy with Rawlins of Utah be
cause he had denounced some of Rawlins'
statements as false.
Burton of Kansas vigorously arraigned
Tillman for his utterances. He asserted
that the Senator who could defend slav
ery anjfl government by the shotgun could
not be expected to think well of Senators
who were trying to carry good govern
ment to the Filipinos. He was astonished
that a. Senator in one breath should make
an appeal for unsullied government in the
Philippines and in the next boast of crimes
almost unparalleled in history.
While Tillman was speaking many of
the Democratic Senators left the cham
ber, his audience on the floor being large
ly on the Republican side./
"When we get ready to, put a nigger's
face in the sand," he shouted, "we put
his body there, too." He declared that
the people of the South never would sub
mit to negro domination and hoaed the
Republican' Senators ' would turn from
their "game of deviltry" in the Philip
pines and assist the South to rid, itself of
the threat of negro domination.
These remarks drew a sensational reply
from Tillman of South Carolina, who de
clared that It was. no longer possible to
sneer away the responsibility for the In
famfes committed by the Americans in the
Philippines. .He said. that if it had been
known in the South that the reinsof Gov
ernment were to be given to- the negroes,
the Civil AVar would have been prolonged
indefinitely: He insisted that in order to
maintain 'their self-respect the white peo
ple of the South had been obliged to sub
due the negro- by whatever means they
could, using the shotgun as one of the
means. He frankly described how the
negroes had been defeated- at the polls,
admitting that the whites had got just
such majorities as were necessary.

told of several which had occurr.ed. on
both sides during the .Civil War. In this

liberty than in any others," were shouting

- It is estimated that 20,000 persons
viewed the remains of Archbishop Cor
rigan in the cathedral to-night. More
than- 25,000 crowded the church between
11 in the morning and 5 o'clock in the
afternoon. Â«- #Â¦*-"
"The Holy Father, with great sor
row, learns of the death of the grand
Archbishop whom he hoped to see in
Rome very soon. His Holiness, who ap
preciates very highly the especial merit
of the dead prelate, expressed his sym
pathy from the depth of his heart for the
metropolitan church of New York, and
he prays God to give to the soul of the
great Archbishop the repose of the just,
and the premium of eternal glory."
Â¦ The Rev. Dr. Ferranti, Italian secre
tary to Archbishop Corrlgan, made public
to-night a cablegram which was re
ceived at the archiepiscopal residence
from Cardinal Rampolla, pontifical sec
retary of state at Rome, expressing the
sorrow of Pope Leo at the demise of
Mgr. Corrigan. The cablegram was ad
dressed to Dr. Ferranti, and Is as fol
lows: .
After the body was taken into the
cathedral a service was held, at which
absolution was pronounced. . Father La
velle, rector of the cathedral, requested
that no flowers be sent to the cathedral,
because the Archbishop was opposed to
flowers at funerals, and his views should
be respected. When the doors were
opened to the public lines were formed
by the police and everything possible
was done to give every one an opportun
ity to see the dead prelate's face the last
time. â¢ ' Â¦ â¢
NEW YORK, May 7.-rMasses for the
repose of the soul of Archbishop Cor
rigan were said this- morning at St.

tended.;. Later the body. x oÂ£ the Arch
bishop .was carried Into the cathedral and
placed at the end of the center aisle
and just; in front of the altar. The head
was placed toward the altar, and was
elevated, so that the mourners could see
the face of the dead prelate half way
down the aisle. ' Â¦ â
Â¦ At the time there were thousands of
persons grouped about the cathedral
awaiting the hour when the doors would
be opened so they, might have an oppor
tunity-to pay a last tribute of respect
to the Archbishop. The body was at

Â¦ Saturday, night the senior women will
hold "high jinks" in Hearst Hall, where
they will " dance among themselves' and
indulge in other thrilling and distinctly
feminine pastimes., Some of the co-eds
started to call the "high jinks", a "dove"
dance, but they were ordered to desist
by their sisters.; "Dove" dance sounded
too mild, so "high jinks" it will be and
nothing else. On the same evening the
senior men will banquet 1.'. San Francisco.
The Imperial Foreign Minister was con
fident the . Delegations would approve of
this since the step accorded with th*?
wishes expressed in both the United
States and Austria-Hungary.
"The enormous rise and daily growing
Importance of the United States, from the
standpoint of imperial policy, in addition
to our growing interests in America, in
connection with our many subjects resi-.
dent there, show it la no longer advisable
to delay elevating the rank of our rep
resentative at Washington to equality
with the representatives of the other
great powers." /. â¢
"Our unvarying and friendly under
standing with the Russian Empire con
cerning events In the near East is con
ducive to the continued maintenance of
order and tranquillity in these regions."
He remarked that since the last session
of the Delegations, the general political
situation had in no way undergone any
material* change. He paid a high, tribute
to the Austro-Hungarian forces employed
in the- Chinese expedition, and referred
to the necessity Â¦ for increased expendi
ture for the artillery, for improving the
naval stations, and for an "indispensable
increase In the personnel of the fleet and
construction of ships."
The addres'sea of the Delegations allud
ed to the continued preservation of peace
and the increased prestige of the dual
monarchy in the councils of Europe aa
"largely . due to the veneration in which
the Emperor-King is held by all." and
promised full consideration of the in
creased demands for the army and of thtÂ»
expenditure required for the development
of the internal Industry and agriculture,
arid for fostering foreign trade relations,
bo as to enable Austria-Hungary to com
pete with the nations of the world.
Subsequent to the meeting of the Del
egates, Count Goluchowski, the Austro-
Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs,
In his opening address, said:
This was the most Interesting passage,
from a general International viewpoint,
in the reply of Emperor Francis Joseph
to the address of the delegations of Aus
tria-Hungary at the reception held at the
castle this morning at Budapest. The
Emperor also made a brief but inv
portant reference to the Balkan sitnatlon,
saying:
BUDAPEST, May 7.-"As in the past,
so In the future, the constant endeavor of
my Government will be directed to fos
tering close relations with our allies, a3
well as feelings of confidence with all
other powers, thus contributing to the
maintenance and consolidation of Euro
pean peace."
From another source it was learned that
Chairman Thomas of the Erie, and Presi
dent Oliphant of the Delaware and Hud
son were unyielding in their determina
tion not to grant any of the miners' de
mands, while President Truesdale of the
Delaware, Lackawanna and Western was
disposed to make some concessions. The
attitude of President Baer and the other
anthracite presidents was not stated.
"I would be glad to give some news, but
as I advised Mr. Mitchell not to talk, it
woujd not be politic for me to say any
thing in connection with the situation."
PHILADELPHIA, May â¢ 7.â President
Baer, of the Philadelphia and Reading
Railroad; still refuses to break his silence
regarding the threatened struggle be
tween -the anthracite miners and opera
tors. In reply to questions as to what
was being done, if anything, to bring
about an agreement he said:
The comparatively early adjournment of
to-day's meeting has led to a general be
lief here that the miners are waiting for
something to turn up, despite the posi
tive statements of President Mitchell that
he knows of no mediatory move's.
Further than this nothing authoritative
could be learned of the proceedings. When
asked if anything had been heard from
the operators Mitchell said: Â¦Â¦,
"I have heard nothing from the opera
tors. No concessions have been granted,
and I know nothing of any movement to
secure concessions."
When the meeting adjburned, President
Mitchell gave out the following . meager
and indefinite response to a request for
an account of what had been done:: '
"The committee is caA-assing the situ
ation very carefully. No decision has as
yet been reached. The^ committee will
meet again to-morrow at 10 o'clock."
SCRANTON, Pa., May 7.â The executive
boards,' of the United Mine .Workers o,f
America for the three districts compris
ing the anthracite coal region met-.here
this morning to consider the report . of
the special committee which had been in
conference with the presidents of- the
coal-carrying railroads, and to decide
whether the men are to remain at work
or go on strike for increased pay, a short
er day's work and an insistence that the
coal shall be weighed atthe mines. Ine
thirty- four miners' Â¦. representatives were
in session all of to-day.

records for two consecutive days at a
Â«1istance of sixty miles and before ac
ceptance-each separate system would be
required to - work satisfactorily for not
less than ten consecutive days, nor more

P STEADY WORK
3r Good, Sustaining- Food.
a young- lad worked In his father's .bake
ehop during his vacation, and because of
his irregular meals began to lose flesh
rapidly. He tells of his recovery by being
put on the right kind of food.
"I had to work hard Immediately after
eating and usually ate just before going
to bed or else had to go without food for
too long a time, also had to eat whenever
I. could get a chance. All these things,
together with long hours of work, caused
dyspepsia. I concluded to change my
food.
"'Father jokingly remarked one day that
If I was too lazy to digest ray food I
might try Grape-Nuts, for that was al-
lesdy digested. I took the joke in earnest
and began using Grape-Nuts with a little
cream. This I lived on entirely with a
little fruit for some time. Gradually I
began to gain weight and finally lost the
distress in my stomach altogether. I dis-
covered I could work steadily without
that 'all gone' feeling as before. Now I
can eat almost anything- and feel fine.
"I have again entered school, but keep
on' eating Grape-Nuts because I feel
strong and my mind is so clear, and I
have ability to apply myself steadily to
my studies.
"Grape-Nuts has been a great blessing
to me and I am sure it has been to many
others, and I thank you for them and for-
myself." Name given by Posium Co.,

The matter, it is said, may bring about
an international dispute between this
country and Japan.
The Island is valuable, owing to the
abundance of guano, and Peacock con
sidered that he had made a rich stake-
In the last few months a small army of
Japanese have landed on the island and
the Japs claim that they are the rightful
owners. They refuse to vacate the prop
erty, and it is stated , that Peacock will
try to eject the Japanese.
In the year 189S Peacock, with a number
of friends visited the island of Marcus
and hoisted the American flag on the
loftiest summit. After a few days spent
on the island, they returned to Honolulu
and Peacock considered that he as an
American citizen, was the rightful owner
of the island.
Among the arrivals at the Occidental Is
W. C. Peacock of Honolulu. He is very
secretive about his visit to this city, but
some of his friends state that he is here
to buy a ship, fcnitflt the vessel with pro
visions and ammunition and, take formal
possession of the island of Marcus, which
Is located In the Pacific Ocean between
the Hawaiian islands and Japan. '
The only way in which the corporation
may be compelled to meet its Just obli
gation to the State is for the Attorney
General to institute suit against it under
the section of the Political Code which
says that the taxes on personal property

ing to the owner, and the corporation has
other valuable real estate holdings. Sec
tion S717 of the Political Code provides

Jointly with the personal property belong
ing to the corporation. Its scheme has
become apparent through the alertness
of Assessor Dodge's deputies.
The corporation 'simply became delin
quent on its taxes and allowed the piece
of real estate assessed for $3120 to be sold
to the State on July '3, 1897. The law pro
vides that the Tax Collector shall give
the State a deed for land sold for delin
quent taxes in five years, or in this case
en July 3, 1S02. It would seem'then that
all the State will ever receive from Wells
Fargo & Co. is the real estate, as the
State cannot under the law sell the prop
erty for less than the amount of the
taxes due, and no one will offer more than
Its value.
There was uncovered in the Assessor's
office yesterday the tale, of how Wells,
Fargo & Co. evaded the payment of taxes
levied In 1806, amounting to more than
560:000. by the employment of a petty sub
terfuge. This consisted in securing the
payment â¢ of personal property taxes
amounting to $64,807 by real estate which
was assessed at only 53120 and permitting
the same to be sold to the State in the
hope that the big corporation would es
cape paying the full amount of taxes
which it owed to the city, county and

The acquaintance of the bride and
groom has been most romantic, as they
fell in love at first sight. Mr. Conness
was walking with Mr. Henton, when Miss
de Lorimier passed them, i Mr. Conness
turned to his friend -and said: "There is
the girl I'm going to marry if I am lucky
enough to get her." It is needless to say
that he made it a point to obtain an intro
duction to the object of -his admiration,
and finally won her for his bride.
Leland Stanford Conness, , '.son, of ex-
Senator John Conness, and a . nephew of
Captain Clark of the battleship Oregon,
married Miss Hattle Marie de Lorimier
last evening at St. Luke's Hospital. Mr.
Conness is in the employ of the telephone
company, but is at present a patient in
the hospital,, having fallen two stories
from a building at Twenty-flrst and Mis
sion streets last Tuesday. The victim of
the accident was pronounced in a critical
condition, having broken four ribs and
hurt- his left hip. All preparations had
been made for the wedding, which was to
have taken place next Saturday, and the
new home for the bride was quite in read
iness when the accident occurred. Al
though the patient is not out of danger,
every hope' is expressed for his recovery,
which may be materially hastened by his
new-founa happiness and the careful at
tention of his bride, who was until recent
ly a trained nurse at Lane Hospital. The
patient's ward was very prettily deco
rated in foliage and spring flowers. Rev.
Dr. -Turner performed the ceremony.

Elwood Clark, the 4-year-old son of F.
B. Clark, a machinist employed at the
Union Iron Works, was struck and in
stantly killed yesterday afternoon by a
Mission street electric car near the cross
ing of Twenty-eighth street. C. H. Vite,
motorman of the car, was subsequently
arrested on a charge of manslaughter,
and released on furnishing $50 cash bail.
When Mrs. Clark and an older child
left the family home at 31 Prospect place,
shortly after the noon hour to visit a
dentist, littlo Elwood was on the side
walk in the front of the house, playing
with several other children. The boy
soon tired of his companions and running
after a wagon followed it a short distance
along Mission street. He then started to
return to the sidewalk and did not notice
an inbound car which was rapidly ap
proaching from the direction of Twenty
ninth street. Motorman Vite applied the
brakes when he saw the'danger, but was
unable to bring the car to a stop before
it struck the unfortunate child and
knocked him down and under the wheels.
Death was instantaneous, the boy's skull
being horribly fractured.

Four-Year-Old Elwood Clark Meets a
ELECTRIC CAB KILLS CHILE.
After the incident the. car was replaced
on the track and proceeded on its way
to the' power-house. The trouble was
probably due to the disarrangement of
the steering-gear, which failed to re
spond to the .motorman, and when the
car was well under way on the â¢ incline
he was powerless to stop it. . Â¦
The car, in charge of Motorman J. M. 1
Swope and Conductor John Dugan, was
crowded with laborers from the different
iron works in the Potrero district. As
it descended the grade near Connecticut
street Swope, in some manner, lost con
trol and the car Jumped the track. '1 he
windows were broken and the car was
generally* damaged. â¢ ".'Â¦â¢ \
Thomas Furlong of 456 Sixth street. was
violently thrown to the ground and was
badly cut about the scalp. William 'Wil
liams of 1232 Treat avenue, received nu
merous bruises about the head and body
and a fracture of the skull, which may
prove fatal. The others who were more
or less hurt were J. Redding, 1714 Doug
lass avenue; Mr. Prior, iiOl Cortland
avenue, and John Mitchell, 1541 Treat
avenue. All the injured were removed
to the City and County Hospital for
treatment.
A serious and maybe fatal . accident
occurred last 'night at 6 o'clock when car
1112 of the Sixteenth-street line jumped
the track while rapidly descending the
grade on Seventeenth street, near | Con
necticut. Three men were more or less
seriously injured and a number of oth
ers sustained a ; severe shake-up.
William Williams May Die
as a Result- of His
Injuries.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. May 7.â To-day's stock mar
ket reflected an unavailing effort to contest the
downward tendency. After yeÂ«terday"s revul
elon rrora the eeml-revolution on Monday, re
actionary tendency was natural to realore the
normal balance of thlr.ee. but this tendency
was reinforced by the decidedly skeptical -sen
timent over the prophecies of the anthracite
labor settlement. These prophecies continued
very confident from sources with every means
cf authoritative Information, but the flat con
tradiction of the rumom received from Scr&n
ton cau&ed confusion and uncertainty and a
suspicion that the Wall-street outgivings were
In the nature of "tips" deslg-ned to Influence
the stock market. Ax a matter of fact. Read
ing was lifted a shade above Ian nleht. The
reports of the condition of the crops and
the weakness of the rraln market were a help
to the grain carrying railroads and they made
a cood advance In the course of the day's ses
sion. The continued aggressive strength of
Louisville and Nashville. Chlcaro, Indianapolis
end LouiFvllle and various smaller subsidiary
Unes coined additional influence from the
response in Southern Railway, which was con
sidered ElKnlficant of closer relations in the
whole Southern croup. Nashville, Chattanoora
and St. Louis, Chicago and Eastern Illinois
and Â£\-ansvllle and Terre Haute all shared in
the movement. Illinois Central was a con
epifuous exception and was heavy throughout,
falling at one time 1%. The advance In Kan
sas City Southern was attributed to the forma
tion of a dooI in the stock. AH of the strong
points, however, yielded to the liquidation dur
ing the last hour, caused by tie relapse in
Reading to 2% under last night. Practically
all of the gains were wiped out and the level
of prices carried below lsst night.
United States Steel stocks did not escape the
depression notwithstanding the extraordinary
exhibition of the last year's transactions by
the company. Tennessee Coal lost 43 points
on account of the disappointing annual report
and realizing In Chicaro Great Western caused
a loss of 2%.
The money market was called easier to-day,
the maximum loaninr rate reachinr 15 per
cent, with a subsequent recession to 6 per
cent, but the decline in the foreign exchange
rate ceased In response to easier money and
CIseueslon Â¦was renewed of gold exports..
Notwithstanding the relief afforded by the
purging of unhealthy Ejaculation la the mar
ket, there lÂ« still a tendency to the feeling that
there may be some inflation beyond the curb
stone bubble which collapsed last week. The
market closed heavy.
The tone of the bond market weakened in
fympathy with stocks. Total sales, par value,
$2,430,000. United States bonds were all un
changed on the last call. â¢_

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND GENERAL
FORECAST.
Local houses were industriously telephoning
to the different Prune districts yesterday, ask
ing for complete .reports as to the extent of
the blight reported' some days ago, and since
confirme- by the Weather Bureau.' The con
sensus of opinion from the different parts of
the State was that while the drop was serious
in most of the larger districts, including Santa
Clara and Sonoma, it was not sufficient to
warrant any scare, and that from present In
dications the crop would . be larger than last
year's, though not such a record-breaker as
was anticipated a week or two ago. Most
growers said that even if three-quarters of
the Prunes did drop off they would still have
a fair crop.

CHICAGO. May 7. â There was a fair show of
strength to wheat at the outset on the in
fluence of yesterday's cash business and more
rains last night in the overwet Northwest.
Traders changed their stand, however, on later
reports of seasonable weather.- The weather
map showed clear weather in the Southwest,"
and what was still more important an end to
the wet weather in the Northwest spring wheat
country for the present. Both these localities
sent in liberal selling orders on the weather
news and their own markets were weaker.
This caused local speculators to lose sight of
bullishly small crop receipts and fairly firm
cables. Longs deserted their holdings and
threw stuff overboard. Trade generally was
not very heavy and the market showed a drag
ging: disposition most of the time. July opened
%@%c to a shade up at 75%c to @75%@75%c,
dropped to 74c and closed weak #@%c lower
at 74%@74%c. . â¢
Corn started with a good show of strengths
When wheat broke corn followed. Trade waa
not large and the greater part of the session
the market dragged. July closed weak at
68%c.
Oats were dull and weak. July closed %c
down at 35%c. . ,
Provisions were dull and fluctuated narrowly.
July pork closed unchanged, lard a shade
higher and ribs 5c up. -
The leading futures ranged as follows: .'

eral trade continues active. Mills are producing
'.trr--- Quantities of goods and merchants appear
to r.&ve no difficulty in distributing them. The
chief complaints are of the Increasing cost of
production and distribution, with a consequent
diminution of profits. This Is likely to prove
a constantly growing feature. There Is no
abatement in the demand for iron and its
products, showing that the industrial activi
ties of the nation are still unwearied. The con
fjirrtlon of coal, iron, copper and other raw
materials continues on a phenomenal scale.
Money will soon be easy again and Is likely to
so continue for the next three months at least
â an important factor In the stock market.
There if more or less expectation of gold ship

score, as a few millions can be easily spared
on this Fide, and the decline of the Boer war

TO PRESENT PROGRAMME
OF TJNTJSNAL INTEREST
Captain Seymour has succeeded in
amassing enough damning evidence
against Hadley to venture the belief that
it will be an easy matter to convict' him
of the shocking crime. Aside from the
strong circumstantial evidence against
Hadley the detectives have uncovered
some startling positive evidence that adds
strength to the chain of guilt that they
are gradually welding around the fugi
tive.
It matters not in what part of .the
globe Hadley' has taken refuge, . for one
of these circulars will follow -him to his
hiding place. In the history of crime
there are but few cases where a man as
.well kriown as Hadley has succeeded in
avoiding police detection for anv great
length of time. " Â¦ - ;
The police hope to have Hadley under
arrest before many, days have passed.
Once they get on his trail it will be an
easy matter to run him down.
EVIDENCE AGAINST HADLEY.
charge of murder Is now safely tucked
away in Captain Seymour's desk, where
it will remain until the missing man is
located. The photograhpic circulars call
ing for Hadley's arrest, which were print
ed Tuesday for Chief of Police Wittman.

fice yesterday afternoon for the purpose
of ascertaining whether the Coroner had
obtained any writings or other evidence
as to Murrey being a Mason and in good
standiiig, so that he might be burled un
der the ritual and at the expense of the
order. No such evidence had been found
J. Solodos, proprietor of the lodging
house, saw Murrey staggering along the
hallway almost helplessly drunk at half
past 9 o'clock in the morning. Solodos
assisted mm to his room. Murrey was
under the delusion that he was being pur
sued by persons who wished to take- his
life and said that he would foil them'
. Murrey was about 50 years old and was
employed by the Empire laundry as chief
marker. A card made out in the name of
John Murray was found among his ef
fects showing that the person of that
name was a member of the Shirt, Waist
and Laundry Workers' Union.
Suffering from an attack of delirium
tremens and haunted by the fear that he
was being pursued by a vindictive enemy,
James Arthur Murrey wrote a penciled
note on a linen shirt cuff to the Chief of
Police and then committed suicide by cut
ting his throat with a razor. The tragery
occurred yesterday forenoon in a lodging
house at 1046 Folsom street, where Mur
rey had been rooming for the past six
months. The shirt cuff on which the note
was written was found in a bureau
drawer. The note reads as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO. Cal. May 8.
Chief of Police G. \V. AVittmanâ Dear Sir
an! Brother: I have been imprisoned in my
room at 1046 Folsom street since 7 o'clock last
night and without the assistance of any of yoar
fcrce. I sent for police protection this morn
ing at 8 o"c;ock, but personally have seen noth
_ins ot the officer who came and Interviewed
one of my assistants, but I heard much of the
interview which was adverse to me. In great
and imminent danger, yours fraternally
JAMES ARTHUR MURREY, 32d Degree
P. S. â Although personally unknown to you
I request an interview, but it is impossible for
mi to leave ray room without risk of life and
limb, and I would ask that an officer be sent
to escort me.

MRS. ALICE FULLER AS SHE APPEARED YESTERDAY WHILE SIGNING ;THE AFFIDAVIT BEFORE JUDGE
CABANISS UPON WHICH A WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR ARREST OF. CHARLES B. HADLEY FOR THE
BRUTAL MURDER OF LITTLE NORA FULLER.
The charter provides that "every ordinance
Involving the purchase of land of more than
$50,000 In. value must be submitted to the
vote of the electors of the city and county
at tha election next ensuing after the adoption
of such ordinance." If it is now proposed
that the city purchase land of more than 550,
000 in value, it appears to be the plain intend
ment of this provision that such question of
purchase shall be submitted to the vote of the
electors. I have, however, held, in an opinion
dated September 24, 1901. that this provision
did not necessitate two elections where it lsj
proposed to purchase such, land - by ttie Is
suance of bonds, the question of the acquisition
of such lands and the issuance' of bonds in
payment therefor being submitted to the elec
tors at. one election.
Three courses are open in submitting public
improvement propositions to the electors: First,
the submission of a' proposition for each sepa
rate improvement, of whatever nature, at a
separate special election. This is the only
course that would be entirely safe. Second,
the eubmission of all- public Improvement propo
sitions ' at one election. .This would be the
ir.ost -hazardous plan to follow. Third, the
submission of a group of allied propositions re
lating to the same general subject matter at
the same election â the proposition to' bond
for school' purposes at' one election, for a
sewer system at another, "for a 'system of parks
at. a third and for a hospital at a fourth. This
Â¦would appear to be an entirely reasonable
manner of submitting such propositions, espe
cially when, as is proposed, each one of the
improvements is placed distinctly and .sepa
rately upon the ballot, giving the electors the
fullest possible opportunity to vote for or
against each proposed improvement.. Such a'
grouping .would not. be permissible under the
strict construction considered above, and there
fore I cannot advise that it would be alto
gether a safe plan; but .the courts would doubt
less hesitate to hold invalid elections so held
Â¦where everything practicable had been done to
givo the electors a full opportunity to declare
their will and a bona fide attempt had mani
festly been made to keep Â¦within the spirit of
tha charter. '
City Attorney Lane filed an opinion
yesterday in reply to questions propound
ed by the Board of Supervisors, in which
he holds that the only safe course in sub
mitting public improvement propositions
under a bond issue, to the electors would
be to submit each separate, improvement,
of whatever nature, at a separate special
election. He also holds that several spe
cial elections for the acquisition of pub
lic utilities or Improvements could not
be held on the same day. as it could not
be maintained that such electjon was held
for the particular bonding. proposition for
which it was called. After quoting the
law on the question, Lane says in his
opinion:
