her in the vacant house on Sutter street
she became violently ill and irrational.

SALT LAKE, April 8.â A dispatch re

Idaho, the terminus of the Oregon Short
Line branch into Central Idaho, an
nounces that the Miners* Union at that
point has called out all the miners and
other workmen employed by the White
Knob Copper Company. It is stated the
strike involves 1000 men. No information
as to thf cause of the strike Is given.
When the company is ready to begin
again, it is said, it will hire non-union
men only.
The first step taken was to issue notices
to the miners occupying houses owned by
the company to move. . The first of these
ejectment notices were served last Thurs
day, - and were to miners who had been
among the leaders of the strike. AH of
the " others ; are to have similar - notices
served upon \ them . during the present
week, and with their families will be com
pelled to move. In addition to this, the
company's stores have been practically
closed and the clerks dismissed.

Rochester and PUtsbufg Coal Company,
has determined the coal company on dras

ANALYSIS BY YOUNG.
Secretary Root said in his letter of
transmission that the documents will
place the House in complete possession
of all the facts which it seeks. The re
ports of Inspector General Chamberlain
and Lieutenant Colonel Maus were not
sent to the Committee on Military Affars
of i he Senate, and the minority of that
committee subjected the War Department
to considerable criticism for withholding
them. The Secretary In explanation said
that.according to the exact language of
the Senate resolution, these reports were
not caJled for. The House resolution
called for all of the facts In the Secre
tary's possession regarding the transport
service, and it is further, explained that
on this account Root has included all of
the documents received at the department
covering the Investigation.
Another result of the investigations was
the almost clean sweep of the clerical
force connected with the service in San
Francisco.
Other statements made in these reports
show that there was negligence in the fit
ting out of transports; that there was no
advertising for bids for materials, and
that the Government's interests received
little or no protection. The state of af
fairs is disclosed which resulted in the
transfer of Major O. F. Long, general su
perintendent of the transport service, and
enforced the resignation of Captain John
Ba meson, marine superintendent of the
transport service.
In some instances it is said that the
cost of furnishing transports used in this
service was all cf 100 per cent above the
isnge of prices of material at that time.
UNCLE SAM NOT PROTECTED.
- CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. X.
"ST., WASHINGTON. April S.â In response
to the resolution adopted by the House
on March 15, Secretary Root to-day sent
to that body an immense mass of docu
ments covering special investigations
made by officers of the War Department
of the transport service between San
Francisco and the Philippines. The re
port sent in by the Secretary covers
pages of typewritten matter reaching into
the thousands, some of which are copies
of reports made to the department and
others the original documents themselves.
Among the most important of these
papers are the reports of Inspector Gen
eral Chamberlain and Lieutenant Colonel
Maus, which go into the details of the In
vestigation, conducted by them Into the
i.'tj-f cut of transports-~u*ed.-oo.the Pa
ciSe, and which charge that preferences

MANILLA; April 8.â Major Littleton W.
T. "Waller at to-day's session of the court*
martial by which he i3 being tried testi
fied in rebuttal of the evidence given yes
terday by General Jacob H. Smith, who
commanded the American troops in the
island of Samar. .General Smith, he said,
instructed Aim to kill and burn, and said
that the more he killed and burned the
better pleased he would be; that it'waa
no time to take prisoners, and that 'ho
was to make Samar a howling wilderneu. -
Major. "Waller asked General Smith to de
fine the age limit for killing, and he re
plied: "Every tiling over 10." .
"EVERYTHING OVER TEN."
The investigation of the. committee re
garding the excesses of American troops
will probably be extended as a result
of the publication of the statement , of
Major "Waller and other officers of the
marine corps that .Brigadier General
Jacob EL Smith .gave instructions to the
marines to kill and -burn; that the moro
they burned and killed the better pleased
he would be, and that Samar was to be
made a howling wilderness. General Chaf
fee will be directed to make a search
ing investigation into these allegations.
Besides the serious effect of the publica
tion of such charges will have lm this
country the relations between the ma
rines and the array will certainly not ba
Improved thereby. General Smith is now
under, orders to return to the United
States to assume command of the De
partment of Texas, but these orders will
probably be suspended pending an in
quiry into the charges of Major Wall*r
and other, marine officers.
"There doubtless have been Incidents of
excess," he said, "but the general con
duct of our troop3 has been of the oppo
site character, as general orders directed.
All violations of the rules of war have
been instantly punished."
In his testimony before the committea
to-day Major General MacArthur declared
he doubted that any war of modern times
has been coriducted^with aa much human
ity and self-restraint as has the rebellion
In the Philippines.
Accompanying the letter is a statement
made by Governor Taft giving an expla
nation of his failure to tell the committee
about the Tayabas report when he was
testifying before It. and the letter of
transmittal sent by the Secretary of War.
The charges are general in character.
They fail to specify any particular out
rage, nor do -they present the name of a
single officer or man who perpetrated the
terrible ' outrages ' with which the army
is charged. Secretary Root has been in
formed by General Chaff ee that he ia
making an investigation. of charges and
when the general's report is received it
will be submitted to the committee.
The committee did not make the letter
public, but it i3 learned that it specifically
charges that American troops, principally
Macabebes, were guilty of astounding
outrages, including the assassination of
Innocent natives and the burning of their
homes." The conduct of the army in Taya
bas is 'further- criticised because . of its
.'attitude toward the civil Government.
Considerable friction has existed between
the civil Governor and army officers witii
the result" that the good anticipated from
the civil Government has not been ob
tained.

WASHINGTON, April 8.â The House bill
establishing civil government in >the Phil

Introduced by Chairman Cooper. There is
little doubt that it will be reported to the
House by the full committee, probably to- i
morrow, and ft the form Cooper Intro- 1
duced it to-day. , j
: The House bill is unlike that>of the Sen
ate in that it provides a complete form of
civil government for r the islands, to go
into effect when' the war terminates, the j
provision being as follows:
"Whenever the existing insurrection In
the Philippines' shall have ceased and a
condition of ; general and Â¦ complete peace
shall have been established therein, and
the facts shall be certified to . the Presi
dent by the commission, the President
shall authorize the commission to call a
general election for the choice of the dele
gates to a popular assembly, of the people j
of the Philippine Islands, to be known as
the Philippine Assembly."
It is further provided that all the exec
utive power then shall be vested in two
houses â the -Philippine Commission and
the ' Philippine Assembly. Provision is
made for taking the census within thirty
days after . the r promulgation of peace.
Thereafter the islands are to be divided
into election districts, and the regular
machinery for electing "a Legislature is
provided.
Section 12 of the - bill provides that all
residents of the Philippines shall have the
same protection from the United States in
their . returns to foreign governments as
is accorded to /citizens of the United
States. â¢ For the purchase of the friar
lands the bill makes provision for the Is
suance of insular bonds at 5 per cent, In
terest payable in gold, the total amount
not being; specified. The regulation - of
franchises, timber lands, mineral lands,
etc., is provided for. A system of coinage
differs from that in the Senate bill, as it
makes gold the standard, with Philippine
token "money, of -silver, maintained at a
parity with gold. The - peso is to be of

"I have tried to avoid this unpleasant
eubject," she said to-day, "for the reason
that I have no desire , to rake up my
career as a performer." ' I first met Nora

seemed to be a quite clever ; I little girl.

remember the name she called her com

me. I am satisfied that he is the man
â¢who strangled her.- There was a peculiar
drift to his actions about the girl-. which
gave, me a distinct Impression that he
meant her harm. ' I 'am also .satisfied that
finally, after months- of persuasion, he
induced her to leave her home under- the
promise that he would install her In a
handsomely furnished flat. The night' I
first met them in the Olympia she several
times asked him to tell her the time. She

asked how much money she could earn
as an amateur and seemed anxious to gee
a char.ee to display her ability. Mrs.
Ward left the place a few minutes later.
She says that if she is not very greatly
mistaken the Fuller girl obtained the de
sired employment and went on the stage
on thp following amateur night.
During the month of October Mrs.
"Ward left the city and did not return
again until late in November. One after
noon about the middle of the. month sh-;
saw.'Xora Fuller with the same man with
whom she had visited- the Olympia, stand
ing on Third street, near the Call build-
Ing. Mrs. Ward walked up to the couple
and shook hands with Nora Fuller,
v hereupon the mysterious companion
gave her a rather cold greeting and
Â¦whisked Nora away down Third street.
That was the last time Mrs. Ward saw
Miss Fuller with her friend. A few days
later, however, she saw Nora Fuller and
Attorney Hugh Grant, whom she knows
by sight, on Market street In front of
tho Emma Spreckela building.
Miss Baker was married here a few
months ago to Bert Ward, a fireman on
the Santa Fe Railroad. Prior to her
marriage she was a concert hall singer,
but since she left the stage she has been
leading a quiet, dignified life and is well
liked and respected by those who knbw
her as a resident of this city.
"I know many people in San Francisco
and I am satisfied that the man was not
a permanent resident of the city. I never
saw him before and his general appear
ance was peculiar. He did not look like
a ciiy man. He looked more to me like
a street fakir or a sharp .country broker.
I would give anything to recall his name,,
but rtmay come to me some day. He.
seemed uncomfortable when in my com
pany and for that reason I never sought .
to learn anything about him â particular
ly after I warned Miss Fuller against hmv
and she insisted so pointedly that he was
all right. 1 would know him among a
thousand men. He had a peculiar face
which I think would impress most women
and few men. Judging from what I saw
of him he was fond of living - around
cheap places in the tenderloin j? for he
seemed to know the resorts very well.

The debate took a wide range and finally
all of the foregoing propositions were laid
on the table, practically without opposi

united action could be secured on any
of the plans proposed. I As the conference
had been without result a resolution was
adopted before adjournment that all of
the proceedings should be secret. Â¦ Â¦ :
The main discussion occurred on a reso

cent reciprocity with Cuba' and an amend

reduction should be made on nails, barbed

ties, binding twine and ; wood pulp ' used'
in making printing paper; also that the

Sam Smart, stage manager of the Olym

but he cannot recall having seen Nora
Fuller. He said last night that it was
possible that she might have been in the
dressing-rooms of the soubrettes without
his knowledge, and she could easily , have
frequented the theater proper without at
tracting his notice. . He had endeavored
to recall her, at the request of detectives,
but had been , unable, to do so. He was
positive that the Fuller girl never ap
peared, on the stage of the' Olympia at
any Â¦.time, as he-has records of all per-'
formers; whether amateur or professional.

the unfortunate girl and forwarded them
to Sheriff Johnson, who, with City Mar

asked for a. statement. She was perfect

she might shed some light on the mys

And, above all, that which I have said ap

brought 'Into the most peculiar intimacy and
relationshipâ the Island of Cubaâ and Task
that In our trade relations with Cuba we give
her a marked - and : substantial advantage, not
merely because it, will redound to our interest

The Relations .With. Cuba. \
And now a special word to you of Charleston
and of South Carolina.' Just twelve years ago,
when I, first went . to Washington to take part
In governmental work,. I was immediately
thrown into singularly close contact and inti
macy with a South Carolinian. It was m)v
good fortune to work with him. for three years/
and for the nine years slncÂ«, and for as lorjg 1
as I shall continue to be in public life,. It wUl
be to me ever a spur to try to. do decent duty
for the republic, because I have been thrown
intimately in contact with as fearless and as
hlgn-minded a public servant as this country
has ever had, my old friend, your former Gov
ernor, Hugh Thompson. S
Mr. Mayor, and you, my hosts and my fel
low-America.n citizens: I should be Indeed but
a poor American myself if I were not deeply
touched and . gratified by the way you have
Kreetod me to-day in this, your beautiful city,
and of course I. feel at home here. I think
that any American who is worth his salt has
the right to feel at home in every part of the
United States. Around this table I see many
men who took part in : the great war. The
war in which the younger among us here took
part was a very little, one, because it did not
have to be any bigger. But it had one thor
oughly. . good effect; - it put Â¦. the . cap on the
structure that has been buildlngr while we were
almost unconscious of it, and it taught us how
thoroughly one we were. When we got through
that war it did not makea bit of difference to
us whether It | was an- admiral who came from
Vermont or a lieutenant who came from' Ala
bama, if the man had. done his duty in such
shape as to Â¦ make us each feel an , even more
generous thrill '. of pride in our common, na
tionality. â¢ The debt that we owed him had

Gentlemenâ In the summer of 1833, I was' taken' violently Hi. My trouble be- .
gan with pain in my stomach and back, so severe that it seemed as if knives ;
vrere cutting me. I was treated by two of the .best physicians in the county,
and consulted another. None of them suspected that the cause of my trouble;,
Â¦was kidney disease. They all told me that I had cancer of the stomach, and '
would die.% I. grew so week that -I could net walk any more than a child a
month old. and I only weighed sixty pounds. One day my brother saw in a
paper your advertisement of Swamp-Hoct. the great kidney remedy. He bought .
me a bottle at our drug store and I took It. My family could see a change in
me. for the better, so they obtained more and I continued the use of Swamp-
Root regularly. I was so weak and run down that It took considerable time
to build me up again. I am now well, thanks to Swamp-Root, and weigh 14S
pounds, and am keeping house for my husband and brother qn a farm. Swamp-
Root cured me after the doctors had failed to do me a particle of good.

SAN JOSE," April 8.â The blossom
fete, which opened* to-day at
Saratoga,' attracted several thou
sands of visitors to Santa Clara
. In a. report dated August 20, 1901, Colonel
Oscar P. Long, general superintendent of
army transport -service at San Francisco,
replies to Colonel Chamberlain's Inspec
tion report. He points out the magnitude
of the service suddenly brought into ex
istence and the . systemizing of affairs as
LACK OF METHOD.
The loss- of Government property,' such
as Â¦ furniture, linen, bedding, tableware,
etc., by Imperfect accounting, Is also sot
forth. He states that the transport Meade
was purchased when twenty-seven years
old for $400,000 and she has since received
$580,000 in repairs.
Upon these facts developed by the in
vestigation General Young relates that
under the pressure of necessity of mov
ing large bodies of troops at short no
tice, lack of methods and forms to safe
guard the Government occurred.
Lieutenant. Colonel Chamberlain speci
fies In detail the feautres summarized by
General Young.- He refers to the report of
the "Bates board" that much of the work
done on the Logan .was defective, also
that the amounts spent on the Hancock,
5547,016, were excessive, and were for lux
urious fittings. Lengthy descriptions are
given of furnishings, etc., of inferior qual
ity, placed on various transports.
Chamberlain says that one of the most
notable abuses has been the use cf great
quantities of high-priced disinfectants.
The transport Thomas, he says, on five
trips used $9295 worth. He says there
also has been an excessive -use of high
priced patent cleaning and polishing, mat-.
ter,.the Thomas using $3243 worth in five
trips. He adds 'that this abuse has been
remedied: Â¦ '-'Â¦--'Â¦ -' : 'Â¦'-- v - :
cessive and material Inferior."
j Prices paid for material : were often
strikingly in excess of the then current
market prices for the same articles of
like quality, and supplies were purchased
in the open market without advertising.
It is further stated in General Young's
summary that "preference seems to have
been shown special firms to the extent of
ordering from them articles out of their
line of business, these firms at the same
time charging exorbitant prices, to tha
extent in a few Instances of 100 per cent
in excess of ruling market rates." â¢ .:
"Of course we would like to see the
contest take place at Charleston," said
Williams, "but it looks as though the
Governor would put a stop to it. If this
is the case, then I suppose we will have
to go to California. At present I don't
know of any other place where we could
pull off the match." -.-.;Â¦
NEW YORK, April 8.â As the prospects
for the fight In Charleston ara not very
promising, it is more .than likely that the
heavy-weight championship battle be
tween Jeffries and Â¦ Fitzsimmons will
eventually be pulled off in California. The
announcement of Governor McSweeney's
refusal to permit any fight to take place
in South' Carolina, while not altogether a
surprise, is disappointing to Fitzsimmons
and his manager, Percy "Williams, who
were in hopes that the Charleston pro
moters would secure the, permission. Man
ager. Williams received a- telegram from
J. C. Jaudon. manager of the Charleston
Athletic Club, yesterday, stating that he
would wire him definite Information to
morrow.
Williams, however, has little hopes of a
contest taking place at Charleston now,
and he believes that San Francisco will
be the battle-ground, providing the Cen
tury Club of Los Angeles is out of the
field for good.

Once again the personal feelings of the
man crop out. "They are calling the
new country Rhodesia," he wrote. "I
find I am human and should like to be
living after my death. Still, perhaps, if
that name is coupled with the object of
England everywhere it may convey the
discovery of an idea which ultimately led
to the cessation of all wars and to one
language throughout the world, the
patent being the gradual absorption of
wealth and human minds of the higher
order to the object."

know their strength, their greatness or their
destiny, but vrhqy are wasting their time
in minor or local matters: but, being
asleep, do not know that throusrh th Â¦
invention of steam and electricity, and
in view of their own enormous increase,
they mutt now be trained to view the vrorld
as a whole and not only to constder' the so
cial questions or the British Isles. Even a
Labouchere, who possesses no sentiment,
should be taught that the labor of EnKland
is denendent on the outside world, ' and if he
does not look out It will boycott the result of
English labor.
"The labor question," he wrote, "is im
portant, but that is deeper than labor."
America, both in its possibilities of alli
ance and its attitude of commercial rival
ry, was apparently ever present in Rhodes'
mind. "The world, with America in the
forefront." he wrote, "is devising tariffs
to boycott your manufactures. This Is
the supreme question. I believe that Eng
land, with fair play, should manu
facture for the world, and, being a free
trader, I believe that, until the world
comes to its senses, you should declare
war. I mean a commercial war, with
those trying to boycott ! your manufac
tures. That is my programme. You
misrht finish the war by a union with
Aiiic-rica and .universal peace after a hun
dred years." _
But toward this millennium. Rhodes
believed the most powerful factor would
be a "secret society, supported by the ac
cumulated wealth of those whose aspira
tir-n is a. desire to do something." and
who are spared the "hideous annoyance"
dailv created by the thought as to which
"of "their incompetent rplations" they
should leave their fortune. These wealthy
people. Rhode's thought, would thus be
greatly relieved and be able to turn
"their ill potten or . inherited.^gains to
some advantage." Reverting 1 , to himself,
Sir. Rhodes said: * .. --." < i**i \

An organization formed on these lines
in the .riouse of Commons, constantly
working for decentralization ana not
wasting time on trivial questions raised
by "Dr. Tanner, or the important matter
of O'Brien's breeches," would, Rhodes be
lieved, soon settle the all-important ques
tion of the market for the products of the
empire
Rhodes commenced his article oy declar
ing tnattne "Key" to ins idea for tne
development of the English-speaking race

LONDON, April 8.â An article on Cecil I
Rhodes by William T. Stead will appear
in the forthcoming number of the Ameri

cerpts from which follow, consists of a
frank, powerful explanation of Cecil
Rhodes' views on America and Great Brit

inmost aims. It was written by himself
to Stead in 1S93. In those days Stead was
not only one of .Rhodes', 'most -intimate:
friends, as indeed- 'he was till, the last,'
but also his executor. Stead's name w^is

I>r. Newton Liberal in His Religious
TWICE ACCUBED OF HERESY.
Teachings.
NEW YORK, April 8.â The Sun says
that the intention of the Rev. Dr. Heber
.Newton to resign the rectorship of All
Souls* Church at an early, day, to accept
the invitation from the trustees of Leland
Stanford University to become the special
preacher at , that institution, as \ an
nounced from his pulpit on Easter Sun
day by his associate, is of interest and
importance.- Dr. Newton i3 in manyrt
spects and for many years has- been- the
most striking figure among the .-Episcopal;
clergy of New .York. Moreover,, his se
lection as a religious teacher .by the great
California, university, is. suggestive, for
Dr. Newton's religious views, frankly lib
eral and even radical, so far disturbed the
repose of the. Episcopal church of New
York that in ' 1&4 .- Bishop Potter y was
urged to discipline, him, and ' sc- vigorous
movement was . started by the Rev. Dr.
de. Costa to- have , him brought to trial
for, heresy. .. ..... . .;
Bishop -Potter simply = cautioned him
courteously to avoid giving occasion for
discord. When again iri 1S91" a petition
was* addressed to the Bishop by several
clergymen- asking that an inquiry con-
Gernlng Dr.. Newton's teachings . be insti
tuted, and it was followed up by a re
quest to the same effect from the accused
minister, it is true that a committee of
clergymen and laymen. was appointed by
the Bishop for the purpose, but nothing
came from it. Since that time Dr. New
ton has been left free from interference,
though he has modified; his teachings in
no way, unless to make them the more
open to - the objections "which had pro
voked the agitation for his trial for here
sy; and his eloquent and persistent fear-'
lessness 'Â¦ in . proclaiming them has at
tracled to his church the more hearers to
be iniluenced by them. His retirement
from his rectorship is said not to be due
to any dissatisfaction with, him . or' his
preaching in his very, prosperous parish,,
for unquestionably the great mass of his
parishioners are deeply attached to * him
;'and proud of him, but'rather to his hope
that a change of scene and activity, will
be of benefit to" his health, somewhat im
paired by The labors of his : long pastor-
; conclusions of the "higher criticism" of
the Bible, which in^ general may be. said
to; have furnished Â¦' the basis for them;
have , since affected the teachings
of Protestant churches very, . exten
sively, and they are accepted if not
actually propagated by professors In
practically all their leading theological
schools. Thus the religious- public has
become accustomed to views which '. pro-;
voked astonishment and resentment when
they began to be proclaimed so frankly by
Dr. , 2<Jewton. Outraged by this indication
of Indifference to the ancient ' faith, Dr.
de Costa went over to the Roman Catho
lic church. Encouraged by it. Dr. Briggs,
so notable as an expounder of the "higher
criticism," passed from Presbyterlanism
to receive holy orders in the Episcopal
church.
Dr. Heber Newton has commanded de
served respect because of the . courage
with which â¢ he has proclaimed his opin
ions. He , has made no attempt to con
ceal them and threats of ecclesiastical
discipline have been powerless to 'restrain
him from their bold expression, and even
from going to the extreme of the conclu
sions to which they lead with a logic so
irresistible. His intrepid > honesty has
made him a distinguished figure in the
New York pulpit, so that his withdrawal
from it will leave a large vacancy. He
has long been influential in awakening in
minds unaccustomed to skeptical inquiry
the spirit of: criticism whence has come
the revolution ' in religious conviction
through which so ' . many " people have
passed or are now passing.

â¢ FRESNO, April 8.â The City Board of
Trustees last night .passed a sweeping
ordinance that effectually abolishes all
forms of gambling in this city. The ordi
nance is aimed particularly at slot ma
chines, but includes all other kinds of
gambling, and provides for the revocation
of the license of liquor and cigar dealers
failing to comply with the provisions.
The ord.inance.is the result of the faulty
operation of several previous ones hav
ing similar objects. Several months ago
the Board of Trustees : passed a slot ma
chine ordinance, making it unlawful for
any one to operate a machine within the
corporate limits. All .of the money ma
chines werevtaken out on .January 1, when
the law went into eff ect,~ but the cigar
men held together, resolving to. fight-the
ordinance. Frequent arrests followed,
but It was a hard matter to get a jury to
convict. On the third trial, L. Samuels,
one of the cigar men, was convicted and
his case was taken to the Superior Court.
Here Judge Church decided that the slot
machine, as operated In the cigar stores,
was a' banking game, and therefore gov
erned by the State law and not by the
city orainance. .
1 his cleared Samuels, but for some days
the cigar men hung back, afraid to pro
ceed against the (State law. Finally the
machines appeared on the counter of Fred
Tegeler, another dealer, who was soon ar
rested and tried under the State law be
fore Justice St. John. The cigar men had
had a sign posted . on each machine
that merchandise to the . value of the
money played would be given in exchange
for every nickel played into the machine,
and this, the defense argued at the trial,
robbed the machines of the feature that,
according to Judge Church's decision,
made them a banking game. Tegeler was
acquitted, and since then ' the machines'
have been operating freely in every cigar
store in town. â¢' - .
At the time that the first slot machine
ordinance was passed, another ordinance,
making all percentage gambling games il
legal, Was adopted. This stopped effec
tually nearly all the games,, but there was'
difficulty" In ascertaining whether or not j
a'\game was conducted . on a percentage;!
basis. Lately a number of the saloons
and cigar stores have been running big
games., asserting, however, that there was
no percentage taken out. In the opinion
of the City Trustees, the gambling evil
was not materially lessened, and last
night there was passed the second ordi
nance, which gives tha Trustees full con
trol over all of the games., .

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 8.
âRev. Dr. Heber C. Newton of
All Souls' Church, New York City,
has resigned his position there to ;
accept the pastorate of the Leland
Stanford Memorial Church. Dr.; Newton,
is one of the most prominent clergymen
in the country and a leader in Episco
palian Church circles. -His religious views
are those of the .most liberal of Episco
palian churchmen, and in engaging him
as pastor at the universslty, Mrs. Stanford
has been extremely fortunate in bringing
to Stanford a brilliant thinker and
speaker and <a man whose denomina
tional views will not Â«interf ere -with the
idea of a non-sectariati college.
Dr. Newton is the author of a number
of religious works, one of the best known
being his "Right and Wrong Use of th6
Bible." Besides his .'duties as college
clergyman, Dr. Newton probably will give
a course in ethics in the university simi
lar to Hhat conducted last, year by the
Rev. Charles R. Brown of Oakland. While
the amount that the pastor will ' receive
as salary has not been made public, it is

paid one year ago. . <
About five hundred .harness-makers are

The records In the County Clerk's of
fice show that special letters of adminis
tration on Dolan's estate were issued to'
Rudolph Urbais of 1108 Hampshire street.
The estate consists of a piece of proper
ty at Twenty-fourth and Bryant streets,
appraised at IS500, which is said to be
far below its real value. The heirs are
Charles Dolan, a son; Emma Dolan, a
daughter, and two married daughters re
siding in New York. On this showing
Miss Dolan is entitled to more than
S2000, and Superintendent Kelly thinks the
Â¦woman should not be maintained by the
city. It is said that Mrs. Urbais. wife of
the administrator, agreed to care for her
for 515 per month, but nothing has been
done toward accepting the offer.
Superintendent W. J. Kelly of the Alms
hcuse made the discovery yesterday that
Emma. Dolan, an inmate of the Institu
tion, is heiress to an estate left by her
father, Hugh Dolan, who died recently.
Kelly is of the opinion that the young
woman, who is said to be feeble-minded,
is being cared for illegally at the expense
of the city. He proposes to take steps
to Induce her relatives to take charge
of her. Failing in that, he will appeal
to the Probate Court and ask that an
allowance be made out of her share of
the estate for her maintenance.

But the "opinion goes on to speak of the -"pre-'

statement that -"the test Is whether the uphold
'lng of one pan and th* rejection of another will
defeat the presumed) wishes of the testator."
,We do not know.; whether the -'.'general Â¦ plan','
or'"the scheme";* of '.the will referred to in the
opinion are based .upon the , testator's '"pre
sumed wishes" - or not. â¢' But, : passing this, we"

After giving 'thecourt the above- quoted
', instructions . as . to .the j correct < method â¢ of
procedure, 7 the,': petitioners diverge^ Â¦; to* a"
brief discussion of a 'point in ? the .fealty
decision.' It' is: hinted* that the -.court -is

Court' Is Given Instructions.
: vine petition goes on to quote the
court's opinion; where in- speaking of the
: decision in" regard * to - the real -property
it is said, "It happened that the distri
bution there appealed from, dealt- only
with the. real property; 'but it would aa
i ciearly have swept away the claim of the
trustees to the personalty if that ; had
been in the way, as it did their claims to
ithe life estate 1 ."
The petitioners make: the following
comment on this statement: ?. â :
"We have, of ' course, no .means of knowing
what the court "would have" done if the case
before it had 'been other than It wan; and we
' submit j with ' deference Â¦ thatp in \ a legal sense,
the court Itself 'cannot know what it would
have done In a case which was neither .before
it nor argued to It. But passing the statement
as to what the court would have done with the
personal property provision (If that had been
in the way),, we submit that If It will look
again into Its former opinion It will see that it
la mistaken In supposing that it decided any
thing about the personal property. This will be
made entirely clear by a brief examination.^
{The . court 'Â¦ spent about six . months de
, elding the, case and It Is feared that the
; phrase about the "Drlef examination'* will
not rest easily on its Judicial stomach.
The petition goes on to show , very clear
ly that the court did not know what- li.
a\as doing when the famous opinion that
settled $9,000,000 was written.
The petitioners a. little further on in the
argument In commenting upon the court' i
citation of a section of the Civil Code in
-upholding -its, position, say:
' -The section ' says ,' nothing . about 'preserving
: the 'general plan of the testator,- .The court â
adopting -a 4 somewhat' loose expression from
another State,'- which has no. statutory provision
like ours, which 'statement is contrary to â¢ the
current authorityâ simply reads that limiting
condition into the section. 'â¢ There is no warrant
for this, i.'v .' '- ; . '.;..
A few pages further on the petitioners
make the following thrust at. the court: -
Comments on the Decision.
The attorneys for the executors of 'the
estate of the late multi-millionaire James
G. Fair filed a petition for a rehearing In
U.e matter of the disposal of the personal
property in the Supreme Court yesterday.
If the court should grant' the desired re
hearing, which the members of the legal
profession in general very much doubt,
the tight will begin all over again. If
not, the dispute will be. finally laid at
rest. It was expected that there would
be presented a petition for a rehearing,
but the document filed in the Supreme
Court yesterday is not just what was ex
pected.-
The argument is â¢ couched In very, re
spectful terms. There is, however, at
various points a vein of severe criti
cism on the action of the court in decid
ing the case as it did. The attorneys who
wrote the" petition stand in no danger of
being cited for contempt. They, are toj
clever for that. -They make some -very
rapier-like: thrusts, however, which are
likely, to be somewhat displeasing to the
Justices of the State's highest- tribunal.
The petition is presented over the names
of Garret W. McEnerney, Robert Y.
Hayne,. William M. Plerson and George
E. Crothers. ** ,
The document opens as follows:
The appellants regret to ] have to trouble the
court witn another petition for rehearing in the

Honors will, consider no trouble too great If it

Mr. Storey arrived in San Francisco
from New York in 1S53, coming by the
Isthmus of Panama route. He entered
the service of Wells, Fargo & Co. the
very day he landed, and was immediately
6ent to Stockton, where he was assigned
to the position of shotgun messenger on
the stages of the company running from
that place to Columbia, then a lively and
thriving mining town in Tuolumne Coun
ty. After filling the dangerous position of
stage guard for a brief time Mr. Storey
was returned to San Francisco and ap
pointed to a clerical position in Wells*
Kargo & Co.'s ofBce there. The company's
headquarters was then located in the
Earn Brazman building on California and
Montgomery streets, and the entire office
force consisted of only eight men. At the
breaking out of the Civil War in 1861 Mr.
Storey was the man&ger of the San Fran
cisco office. He resigned from Wells,
Fargo & Co.'s employ that year and em
barked in business for himself, but re-en

lOfrHIRDST; -:- San Francisco;DESPITE the continued activity of the hostile
forces â¢ in South Africa, and the repeated
fierce attacks of the Boers upon the cordon >
of troops that Kitchener is throwing around them,
there is unquestionably now visible a brightening
prospect for peace. King Edward is. known to, be
eager to put an end to the war before his corona
tion; the British Ministry, heartily sick of the strug
gle that is costing upward of $1,000,000 a day, is
willing to offer good terms, and among: the bravest
of the Boers there are unquestionably many who will
not be averse to making'peace at something short of
their original demands. â¢
. The war has brought surprise and disappointment
to- both parties, but it^ must also have brought to
each of them a far higher respect. for, the other than*
would have been possible, without war. The British
have learned that the sturdy burghers are, not a half
barbarous people incapable of defending themselves
against a disciplined army, and on the other hand
the Boers have learned that when Gladsto'ne stopped
fighting after Majuba \ Hill it, Was not because the
British were cowards. . Haying been at war against
one another now for more than thirty, months, but
with no decisive advantage as yet on the side of
either combatant, the- common sense. of the leaders
must perceive that any peace would be more'honor
able to, both than to continue- a war thatVthr)Â»'-itVÂ« e
PROSPECTS FOR PEACE
The Democratic press and the independent newspapers with Democratic inclinations comment in this style on
STgflthe controversy in the Republican camp: /^ â¢!'Â¦Â»'.:
The County PaperâMartinez:
â¢ With only a short time to elapse belore the
State conventions the. California campaign Is
ln a very backward state, except ln<the'mat
ter . of the battle N>f â¢ the Republican machine
and Â¦ anti-machine factions over the guberna
torial nomination, j The entire political situa
tion Is chaotic, and the calculation of ordinary
campaigns has given way In. large measure to
guesswork. The chances of aspirants for other
State offices are so ' interwoven with the guber
natorial nomination and that nomination Is so
dubious at present writing that the minor Re-Â«
publican candidates have been ln no hurry to
show themselves until the sky cleared some
what as to the gubernatorial fight.
Seldom- has there been -such a destructive
warfare waged within the ranks of the Repub
lican party as Is. going on at the present time,
and there seems at present little chance of
restoring â¢ even > the semblance of harmony
among the Republicans of California. The
anti-Burns fight which began In 1899 has grown,
steadily worse. It now centers upon Governor
Gage Burns' ally, and It Is ' likely that the
antl-machlne force will beat him for the nom
ination or defeat him if he is nominated.
Great numbers of â¢ prominent * Republicans
throughout the State have openly asserted such
to be their Intention, and it is evidently no
empty threat. ' ' Â¦
It is rather significant that within the past
few 'months but little has been heard of Flint,
who several months ago '-. was the - proclaimed
candidate of the opposition to Gage. There are
Indications that the antl-machlne people, after
using the San Benlto man as a rallying point
for I the disaffected, are looking I around for a
compromise candidate either favorable to their
side or neutral, who has not. as yet taken part
ln the, conflict, and who may, for that : reason,
be able to Â¦ win Â¦ over some of the I leaat sturdy
of Gage's supporters. . This In a sign. of weak
ness showing that the opposition has no con
fidence that it ' will Â¦ be numerically strong
enough to score a straight victory. For this
reason several other .candidates have been
brought forward, among the principal ones be
ing Dr. Pardee of Alameda," Railroad Commis
sioner Edsonand Congressman Victor Me teal f.
all three - of 'Â¦Â¦ whom occupy somewhat â¢ neutral
ground as between the two factions. . >J
The aim Â¦Â¦ or tho machine . men is, . evidently,
to I make I a showing of great.' strength ..before
1 the meeting of Â¦ the -State convention, ln tho
hope ; that ; the. opposition will become dis
couraged and > accept peace proposals. ";' If this
plan falls It Is doubtful ; if Gage will be re
nominated in" the face of so much savage op
position ln-nis own party. That his numerical
support in i the i convention will be sufficiently
heavy to : force hla renomination Is ; almost a
certainty. ' But It Ms also certain 'that the ma
jority of. Gage'* supporters would be unwilling
to vindicate the Governor*" at theiexoense ot
the losa of - the Â¦ Governorship to " the ;. party.
There would < be nothing ln Â¦ that. It-la ; far
'more-likely that- lf'the machine becomes con
vinced that Gage will. If nominated; be knifed
by any considerable , number of Republicans
it < will fall Â¦ ln behind some compromise . candi
date, who. no matter who he may be. ,or what
his affiliations, v ! will.',: after s> election.* find it
necessary to recognize the claims of the largest
and most powerful faction of Â¦" his party. > So,
i Jn snlto Of giirfnco lnrllrnttnns to the contrary.
the prospects for the renomlnatlon of Governor
Gage are not very bright.
Marysville Democrat:
"Assemblyman Mellck of Pasadena utilized
several columns of space ln the Pasadena
News the other day in a review of the adminis
tration of Governor Gage. Ha alms at an im
partial presentation of facts and does not omit
giving credit where' he thinks credit Is tl.ua.
but he says: 'Just so sure as Governor Gage's
renomination is forced by the aid of boss rule,
so sure will the Republican party be defeated
al the polls.' " â Napa Register.
Cdltor Mellck is a courageous, . honest.
Christian gentleman, and. as member of - the
Assembly three terms he made a clean score
on every, matter of importance. He resides
only a ; few miles from the home of Governor
Gage and he is on friendly terms with the gen
tlcman. His judgment we have faith ln, par
ticularly so in tbe matter . here referred to.
Boss rule means rule or ruin, and Mr. Mellck
possesses the courage as a Republican to warn
the party leaders that a nomination . at this
time forced by the bosses means ruin.
Sacramento See:
This will probably â¢ prove a Republican year
In California' provided the Republican party
shall nominate a -popular ticket, j But should
Gage be renomlnated for Governor and the
Democrats name a first-rate and popular man
for that â¢ position, their ticket would have a
good chance of â¢ election.'
â¢ There is very much opposition to Gage in
h!i own party. Even- in Southern California
this Is strong and outspoken. Few of the Re
publican papers down that way are giving him
any support -and the most prominent of them
are openly opposing- â¢ him. In San Â¦ Francisco
Gage has 'the Chronicle Â¦â¢ and Call arrayed
against him in such .violent antagonism that
should ho be nominated their subsequent
"swinging. Into line" could do him little good.
If Gage , shall be renomlnated It will : be
through the strength of the Republican "ma
chine" and not In response to any popular de
m&nd. " There is no enthusiasm for him In ' his
own party, and the attitude of the public
toward him is one of cold indifference If not
narked disfavor. - The principal reason for this
it-, his arrogant bo?aism. There - was never a
' Governor In this State who equaled ' Gage Â¦ In
tho attempt to rule his party. His dictatorial
treatment of the . Legislature and the abuso of
the veto power to further . hiÂ» own Â«hort
slghted ends are notorious. It was well un
derstood ln the last Legislature that â¢ members
who opposed Gage's measures need Â»iuect
no bills of their own to receive his approval
This was most : odious conduct . on the part of
the Governor and one. which the people natur
ally, execrate, as It is destructive of free dis
cussion -and honest voting In the Legislature
and so tends to the overthrow of popular nov
trnment.. ... . . .','Â¦Â¦
It may be conceded t..at Gage is personally
1 onest in the sense that he Is not a boodler
ond has .not countenanced flagrant lob^ or
â¢steals.".' But. politically he. -is far from
honest, as his course with regard to platrue
has indicated. In his appointments to of flee
l.e has not been governed by a, high regard for
the .public '.welfare, but by what he ha-icon
nldered his own political Interests. His lrinn-
enc* and example have been strongly la mp
port of the rotten spoils system and against
every principle of civil service reform. His
recent appointment of the notorious San JosÂ«
boss, John D. Mackenzie, to a place *n tbÂ«
Poard of Harbor Commissioners, la character
istic of his administration. Instead ot Ptrlv
lng to elevate and purify the public service.
Gage had prostituted it to his own selfish ends
He stands for no principle, but simply â¢. for'
s-polls and personal power. From his adher-'
enta he exacts not merely support, but grovel
ing submission to his imperioug will, and tha
surrender of all freedom of speech and of opin
ion.
5? impossible to any man not narrow-minded,
dictatorial and egotistical. Tho narrownes. hi
has displayed in public matter, has beenT al
most incredible. Early, ln his admifflstrmUon
thia cropped out in ludicrous fashion through
pLZ b J U Â£L r * f ?TS V* fUrnlsh tbe Associate
Press a copy of his inaugural address, for tha
Pitiful reason that The Call is a member of
the Association and ao would have access tÂ»
The Bee is inclined to think, however, that
Henry T.- Gage has probably saoceeded ln hiÂ»
scheme to capture the next Republican Stata
Convention, and that he will be renomlnated
despite much opposition 1 from partisan Reouh
llean newspapers and murmurings of discon
tent from the party rank and file. And after
his nomination the orators of tho "Party nÂ«
Prosperity" will .trive to make the peopla be
lieve the salvation of the.State from^ruia and
decay will depend upon his re-election. >
If the Democrats had at this time a man
like the late Stephen M. White to put a t^ ha
head of their ticket it would be a glorious oÂ£!
portunlty for thÂ« party and the people to rSl

THE DEMOCRATIC PRESS,
"It ,1s really â¢ surprising to note how few
friends or even supporters Governor Gage
has in this section' of the State," . said Mr.
Hamilton. "I may say that without excep
tion every person I talked with during my
stay in Los Angeles was an anti-Gage man.
Among these were a large number of follow
veterans from different localities in Southern
California, and also included several men
iromlnently connected with State politics, and
at least one . Republican State Senator from
Los '"Angeles County. No better Instance
could be had regarding the opinion of the old
soldiers on the subject than one which took
place in the lobby of our hotel an evening ago.
I should Judge that there were some sixty of
us gathered, discussing various subjects, when
The following interesting ' Interview with C.
15. Hamilton of C61ton, one of the stanchest
Republicans in the State, and for. years l-romi
nent in 'political and Grand Army circles, we
find In the San Bernardino Sun:
Los Angeled Times: \
In the important work of selecting a candi
date to be supported for Governor of California,
the Republicans . of the State. - the bone and
shtew of the, party, the men of courage, patri
otism and fagacity will fearlessly Investigate
the fitness of all aspirants, and will especially
inquire into the claims put forth in behalf of
the incumbent. Governor Gage.
Tho delegates to the State Convention, if they
shall truly represent the p*>ple, ' will proceed
with their chosen task with coolness, courage,
deliberation and a judicial determination to
find the facts, consult. the best interests of the
State and party, and. to choose that candidate
who will best represent Its principles and be
roost certain to win an election. For success
is both a necessity and a duty. The throwing
av/ay of a victory within reach Is a Â¦ party
clrnc. .
: There â¢ nre enough principal and legitimate
public objections to Governor Gage and his ad
ministration to . cause the State Convention to
deny him, without descending into the domain
of mere personal or private opposition; or act
ing upon personal prejudices or dislikes,' how
ever numerous they may be in any quarter.
Tho Inquiry can be made effective without en
tering that prolific field. . ,-
The objections to the Governor's administra
tion are not' merely general and indefinable;
they are specific, definable and unmistakable.
His appointments to office have frequently
been made upon . a. low plane, and the ap
pointees in more than one instance are neither
reputable, competent t nor worthy. Look at
these examples : j
, "Johnny". Mackenzie.
â¢ Walter Moore. Â¦Â¦ , - .
Walter Parker. ,"
||Bcn" Fehnemann.
'â¢Dan" Kevane. -.
And so on, ad lib., with other "birds of a
feather," whom to merely name Is sufficient..
A'! were put Into public places by the Gov
ernor, and they are drawing the State's money
for services which. If they are fit to perform
them. It requires an affidavit to prove.
It Is this class of â¢ persons, men without
standing and without merit, whom the Gov
ernor has been selecting - for his official ap
pointees in places of trust and responsibility.
These men. and the like of them, he Is using
to manipulate the political machinery of the
State; to Intrench himself in the executive of
fice; to override' the popular will; to perpetuate
his official power; to force his nomination for
a second term, and to make of the Republican
party In the State a machine to be controlled
and operated by himself and his satellites. It
is revolting to Independent and manly citizens,
to Republicans who believe in the doctrine that
men chosen for office by the people, under a
free government, are servants, not masters.
The Republicans of . California are not sleep-
Ing, but are alive to the political situation.
They have watched the official mistakes and
noted the public offenses of Governor Gage, and
before Indorsing his acts they will demand an
accounting from him, as is their right as the
political arbiters of the State. The great body
of the party, not the . professional politicians,
will make this demand, not, in passion, not
through personal ill will or disappointment, not
in a prescriptive or crucifying spirit; but coolly,
deliberately and in a stern, judicial manner, as

out those reforms in the State's administration
which it so sorely needs.. .. . 'Â¦
In the proper and necessary work of scrutin
izing the official stewardship of the Governor,
the Republican delegates, if they shall truly
represent their constituents, will ask, finally:
Why should this official be given | a second
term? What act pre-eminent In Its merit and
usefulness can he point to as Justifying his
claim for another trial In the Governor's office?
If he pleads a low tax rate and a limited State
expenditure. during his .term, let him point to
what he- has built â to what he has done in the
'direction of notable expansion and achievement
-âduring his term. - Let him show how the per
manent State establishment has been improved
and enriched by him as Governer, or under his
administration. Let him show some distinct
and sufficient reason for his demand for another
term before it is conceded to him;
Four years In the Governorship of a great
State is a long period; and Us expiration marks
the proper time for a change, unless It can be
clearly shown, to the satisfaction of the people,
that the incumbent has rendered such pre-emi
nent services to the State as to place him head
and shoulders above all other . citizens of the
commonwealth as the one and only man to se
lect for this high office.
Badlands Citrograph:
The association of the real estate men comes most
appropriately to round out the work the promotion
committee will begin. In fact, without such an as
sociation the movement would have been impeded at
the very moment of success, for were the real es
tate men to hold aloof or were they to work fn oppo
sition to one another, manj' a home-seeker who
might have been induced to settle in the State would
be rebuffed by conflicting stories told of this section
or th-t section, and would return East disgusted with
the wrangling. y , '
It is worth noting in this connection that wherever
in the West there has been rapid and general
progress the forces which led to it have been largely
generated and directed by real estate men. No other
class or profession in our Western life has been more
active in the work of upbuilding the general pros
perity. In fact, so urgent and persistent have they
been in many localities that they have been fre
quently mocked at as "boomers" and caricatured
as sharpers who deal in town lots much as if they
were gold bricks. Too often their best efforts to
Help the community in which they do business have
been baffled by the dull stagnation of the people
themselves, and they have had to bear blame for
failure when the blame should have been placed upon
other shoulders. On the other hand, where success
has attended their labors they rarely get the credit
they deserve. Still as a rule, indifferent alike to
baffling opposition or unfair criticism, the - average
California real estate dealer has .kept up his lick.
He has never run down his town or disparaged the
climate, the soil nor the people of his locality. If
at times things have not been lively and everybody
cheerful it has not been the fault of the men who
have carried day after day the double responsibility
of getting every investor the worth of his .money and
every seller the worth of his land.
The organized union of these trained experts Jn
real estate business promises to be of immense value
not to themselves alone but to every client they have
on their books. Working together there is good
reason to believe they can soon set in motion all
the progressive elements of the people. As. allies of
the promotion committee and the State Board of
..Trade they will be invaluable. Northern California
may look upon its prospects as being greatly bright
ened by the organization of the California Real Es
tate Board.
The organization begins under propitious circum
stances. The spirit of enterprise and co-operation
is more active in Northern California than it ever
was before. Through the entire region north of the
Tehachapi a new vigor stirs in the blood of men.
In county after county progressive men with big
ideas and abounding energy have found a following
and with one accord the people are uniting for joint
action in the direction of the common good. The
meetings which led up to the organization of . the
promotion committee were cheering in "every re
spect. There was no idle 'boom talk," but plenty of
talk that was "strictly business," and as a conse
quence the most conservative of business men feel
that the new movement is one they can safely and
cordially join. It is rot going to end m futility. It
means success.
Â«y - t ARDLY less important than the organization
Iâ A of the promotion committee to assist "the
JL JL State Board of Trade in advancing the wel
fare of Northern California is the organization of
the Real Estate Board, which was effected on Mon
day. In fact, the new organization is an essential
adjunct to the other. When the promotion com
mittee, with all its allied and affiliated associations,
"lias brought to California home-seekers or capital
ists looking for investments, it will remain for the
real estate men to ihow them where to find what
they are seeking. As Chairman Wooster put it in his
opening address, "It must necessarily rest with the
real estate seller to find each individual home for
each individual home-seeker."
THE REAL ESTATE BOARD.
Dr.. Wendlandt, however, thinks otherwise. He
believes there should be a European alliance against
America and -says: "The* idea of a ; European cus
toms; union, supported by English statesmen. will not
again disappear from the scene. The provoking
commercial policy of Americans is creating a world
of enemies." Such. statements do not show so much
of reason as of bad feeling, and yet there . is ho occa
sion for such feeling. The United â¢ States ; is
doing what is best for the prosperity of her own peo
ple. European nations have a right to pursue a simi
lar, policy. If they can achieve it by the formation
of a European customs union ' let -them: do so.:
Should such a union: prove a peril tb us we will meet
it as;best.\ve can, but we are not going, to be fright
ened by a 'mere threat of it. " v ',
Locomotive 'engineers ; have - noted that' it ; was on
March 24, 1802, that the first* patent for a locomotive
was issued, being granted to Richard Trevithick for
"an improved steam engine.to give motion ito wheel
carriages- of every description."" Considering; what
locomotive. engineering is now doing in all parts of
the world' it is evident the fellows of the old, bygone
nineteenth century had a good ; move on them. . .
Â¦ The . sale of American products in Europe is not
more- an aggression upon'them nor a peril to them
than is the sale of European products ;in this coun
try. For a long time we have been a rich market for
European' goods. We did not look ;upon the com
ing of such goods as a peril, nor did we . talk of
going to war about the matter.. On the contrary,
we made the best of the situation, and set about
building \\p factories of our. own. 'If we are now
turning the current of trade it is because we have
fairly beaten our competitors, and the> have no just
cause of complaint. f
... Such reports -from our Consuls connrjn all that
Dr. Wendlandt has to say of the severity of Ameri
can competition in Europe. They attest the excel
lence of the protective, system, and show that the
Dingley tariff is working out its results with. the pre
cision and' rapidity pf a machine. : It is hardly likely
the American people will ever consent to set,aside a
fiscal system which is so beneficial to American in
dustry, and yet that. is what Dr. Wendlandt and the
European manufacturers would have us do. He and
they expect us, to throw down the protection given
to our industries, and not only cease to invade Eu
ropean markets, but to leave our own markets open
to their invasion.; . . .
The review goes on to say: "There are, indeed,
surprisingly few of the articles which used to be ob
tained exclusively abroad that are not now produced
in the United States. The woolen as well as the silk
industry of France and the hosiery industry of Ger
many are said to be suffering severely from our com
petition, and the Bohemian glass industry is feeling
the effect of thejnerease of glass manufacture in the
United States. Our cottons are steadily gaining in
taste and finish and are now sold in England in com
petition with the Manchester product. Says the
Leipziger Tageblatt: 'Even in fancy articles in which
the European market has. set styles for the entire
world the American manufacturers are beginning to
compete with the European.' "
I We do not have to take his statement of the ef
fects of American competition in Europe. Our own
Consuls bear ': ample testimony of the conquest we
are making over the: trade of almost every European
market and in well nigh every kind of goods. In
the current "number of- Consular . Reports, for ex
ample, there is a review of our foreign commerce
in 1001 which says: "It is a most significant fact
that even in specialties which were orice thought ex
clusively their own the. United Statesis becoming a
more and more formidable competitor. J Who would
have imagined a "few years ago that- we ; would' make
such rapid progress in the manufacture of, silk that
we would soon cease buying silks from" France, with
the exception; of highly finished goods, and would
actually be exporting silks to that country? Yet this
is what: has happened."
. Dr.. Wendlandt is an authority upon German in
dustry and trade, and " unquestionably is in close
touch with the leading manufacturers of the em
pire and probably of all those of Continental Eu
rope. ' He has long had a high reputation as a writer
on economic ; topics, and was one of the founders of
the. Manufacturers' Association, which at the begin
ning of this year represented ,13,000 industrial firms
in Germany. His article, therefore, is significant of
the trend of sentiment among a powerful body of
men and is deserving of careful attention from the
American people. ,
UNDER the title "A -German'" View of -.the
; American ; . .Peril". â¢ Dr. Â¦ Wendlaridt, Â¦" secretary
Â¦ of the Manufacturers' Association ; of Berlin,
contributes; to the j^orth American. Review what he
doubtless . regards as a serious warning tÂ«J . the people
of the United . States.: 'He describes the Dingley
tariff .. as.the salient feature .of.. American "aggres
sion" upon; the; industries and the 1 commerce of Eu
rope,- and says : "The characteristic- of. the American
peril is that it does not menace "any. single European
country;' but all European, commercial* states alikej
and last, btit riot least, the United States itself.- The
natural consequence "of this," condition of-' affairs is
that it â¢ creates the necessity for common resistance

Pomona Progress:
The Republican bosses in this State are pre
paring to make a supreme final eÂ«ort a^ the
ccming State nominating convention of thÂ«
party to retain control of the party organiza
tion and nominate Gage for Governor. No
ctcne will be left unturned, no string unpulled.
that will contribute to that result.
We say â¢ 'final" ' effort, for the defeat of Daa
Burns for United States Senator was a severe,
set-back to the machine and one that- dimmed
greatly the lustre of Its prestige; and the.
bosses realize that another defeat in the com
ing campaign would be their complete over
throw. So a life and death struggle Is at hand,
with the great body of Republican voters on one
hand pitted against the Dan Burns machine
on the other. . -
And the result will depend upon whether the
Republican voters do their duty, at caucuses
and primaries when the time comes. The vot
ers can run the party if they want to: the Dan
Burns machine will run ft for them If permit
ted to 'do so.
But the voters cannot beat the machine on *>
negative campaign. They must be more than
"antis." Simply an "antl" campaign .never
boat anybody.
The Dan Burns organization, with Gage as
Its candidate is -a positive force; it can be de
feated only with the positive force of organized
effort In support of some other candidate.
The campaign,, has progressed far enough to
make It reasonably certain that if the Dan
Burns machine is defeated in Its desperate ef
fort to renomlnate Gdge for Governor against
the protest of the best men of the party in all
parts of the State, it will be under the oppo
sition leadership of Thomas Flint. Reports
come from one end of the State to the other
that prominent and tried Republicans are ral
lying to the support of Flint. It is such a re
volt against bossism as has never before been
seen in this State; and 'would not have been so>
pronounced now if the Republican bosses and
Governor . Gage had not so disgracefully pros
tituted the party organization and the guberna
torial office to the low purposes of endeavoring 1
to foist Dan Burns upon the State as Its rep
resentative in the United States Senate. The>
only security the State can have 'against &
repetition of that experience lies in the retire
ment of Burns and Gage to private life. - :
But Gage can be defeated and Burns over
thrown as a poUtical boss only by the success
of some other candidate for Governor, about
whose standard the best elements of the Re
publican party should rally with prompt and
vigorous determination.
Oroville Register:
Every Republican who has the good of bla
party at heart ought this year to attend th<?
primaries. Every effort ought to be made to
defeat Gage delegates. It is believed that the
machine element will use every exertion to rÂ»
nominate the present Governor. Those who
have a regard for ' the party and who love th<Â»
State ought to do their utmost to defeat him.
It is stated upon pretty good authority* that
Senator -Cutter ot Tuba i will come- before the
Republican State Convention for the nomina
tion for Governor. Mr. Cutter is an able man.'
well fitted for the position, and is a represen
tative citizen of . this sark of the State. . He
would make an excellent- Governor. Â¦ Â¦">'..Â¦
San Diego Union: . . ;
The California delegation in Congresa would
render a substantial service to the cause of
civil service reform and clean DOllUcs by
bringing to the attention of President Roose
velt the conduct of John C. Lynch, the Collec
tor of Internal Revenue, with a request that
that official be relegated to private life. Dur
ing his term in office Lynch has devoted him
self largely to ring politics. He has sought to
enact the role of boss and has been ao suc
cessful that he is regarded as second only to
Colonel Dan Burns- himself in the manipula
tion of the machine politics of this State. Ha
embodies all that is obnoxious to the decent
element of the Republican party of California.
It is a far cry from San Francisco to "Wash
ington, still there la no reason why President
Roosevelt should not be made acquainted with
the malororous methods of Boss Lynch. They
are known the length and breadth of the State,
and they should be known at the White House.
The Republican party of California is at pres
ent engaged in a life and death struggle with
a disreputable eons of political rlngsters who
seek control of tha organization. I Their suc
cess means the defeat of the party at the.
polls next November. "With such men as-
Burns, Kelly. Crimmins and others of that
ilk the President has nothing to do; they are
not office-holders. But with Lynch he can
deal, and doubtless would, were matters that
are of every-day notoriety here in California
given publicity at Washington.

\^_JL coterie of State officers and attaches the Governor has no political friends. His recent misuse of omoal

one end of the State to the other is: "We, have hadenough of Gage." The impression that his candidacy wiu De^cut
out before the nominating convention assembles is obtaining force. The leading men of the partyywno so earnest/
and actively supported him in 1898, are foremost in the movement "to retire him to private life. ..The influential news
papers which gave life an>d vigor to the Republicans in the gubernatorial contest four years ago perceive that uage
is a heavier load than the party can carry. What the people think of Gage is fairly expressed in these comments:
A pprehensidn That Disaster to the Party : Would Be
Â¦ Result of His Renomination. â¢
As treaties cannot be kept unless the people keep
them, can our sovereignty be vindicated unless the
people vindicate it? Shall it be 'written that, we be
gan as a people who threw tea overboard and re
fused to drink: it because it represented a- principle
abhorrent to sovereignty, and ended as a people who
traded sovereignty off for the price of mules?
An examination of the question leaves one in
doubt about the power and the duty of our Govern
ment in the matter.. If neutral rights are not vio
lated, what can the Government do?. Does" not the
issue, like every issue affecting our national honor
in international affairs, go past the Government to
the people?
The only justifiable criticism is' introspective. It
is of ourselves and by ourselves. Are' we in the
same relation to Great Britain that Hawaii was to
us? Has our sovereignty no dignity to be insulted?
This dispatch announces that on our soil there are
in operation "various departments" of the military
service of Great Britain, and her official representa
tives are inspecting the same because scandals are
alleged in their administration. It is quite doubt
ful if under her imperial organization this would be
done on the soil of any crown colony of Great Brit
ain, outside of India. There is every evidence that
it would not be permitted in the Dominion of Can
ada.- Why is it permitted here? We pass no criti
cism upon Great Britain for doing it. All is fair in
war, and she. needs no justification in her own eyes,
nor before the strong powers of the earth, each of
which would do the same thing.
Dismissing all discussion of neutrality, do we not
owe something to the dignity of our own sovereignty?
We do not suggest this from the standpoint of an
tagonism to Great Britain. She is right, in discharg
ing the duty of her officials to their Government, in
using any advantage that others may give her. We
would do the same, as would any strong power.
We used independent Hawaii as a military base in
the Spanish war, and. Great Britain has used. Por
tugal in the same ; way. But if others humble their
sovereignty for Great Britain or for us, shall we
imitate them?

mand of the British military station at New Or

General Stewart and Colonel Holland expect to re
main in New Orleans a week, and in that time they
will thoroughly examine into the stock transport
service. The scandals which developed in the Brit
ish War Office some time ago in connection with
the shipment of mules are responsible for the gen
eral's visit.
But,, after it is settled that our neutral obligations
are inviolate and that treaties and the law of nations
justify us, is that all? Are we duly regardful of our
sovereign rights? The news dispatches from 'New
Orleans of March 30 say: "Lieutenant. General Sir
Richard W. Stewart, K. C. M. G. and K. C. B., ac
companied by his aid de camp, Colonel Holland, of.
the Royal Artillery, has arrived here. The general
is here to make inspection of the various depart
ments of the remount service of the .British military
establishments in this country.
Our own position in the Philippines compels this
view, no matter how repugnant to the sense of nat
ural justice. In war the law is silent,' and natural
justice may not be appealed to in behalf of people
with no sovereignty. It may be made plain that
we violate no treaty and no provision of interna
tional law by augmenting the military resources of
Great Britain, and the mule breeders of Missouri
and the horse ranchers of Montana may pocket their
profits in peace of mind. The ill wind that blows
upon 'the Boers is a zephyr of gain to Americans; '
We have suggested this view of the situation de
veloped by our augmentation of Great Britain's mili
tary strength in South Africa by the shipment of
contraband goods from New Orleans to Cape Town.
As . she claims to have annexed the South African
republicans, technically these people in arms are her
rebellious subjects, "warring against her; and have no
sovereignty nor neutral rights which inhere in sov
ereignty alone.
t ET it be conceded that neutral treaties. arid the
I duty . of neutrals as writ in international law
â¢*â ' are vital only in conflicts between sovereign
states, and not in the case of armed action between
such states and their insurgent people, and what
then? In the Geneva award we established the prin
ciple that a' neutral can be made to smart for acts
to the damage of such a state. England paid us fif
teen millions for fitting out Confederate privateers
in the Clyde. Does it remain to be settled that if a
neutral is not allowed to harm, neither must it help
a state in conflict with its own rebels? If so, it will
never be settled, for the reason that the help given
is against rebels who may not succeed, aAd, if they
do, they cannot punish others for acts antecedent to
their independence. â¢ :

NEUTRALITY.
THE SAN FRi/LXCISCO : CA^
some one of the boys called out, 'Hey, there,
C. B., how does Gage stand up in your coun
try?'
" 'He doesn't stand at all,* says I. 'he's
layin' down.' And then everybody became
aroused on the subject, and finally, when the
question was put: 'Is there a man In the
crowd who is going to vote for Gage's nomi
nation?' would you believe it, out of that
bunch of men, veteran representatives from
all over Southern California, there was not
&n 'I,' while in answer to 'whom will you vote
for?" one man called out, 'Anybody to beat
Gage.' Of course, I Â¦ am not so rash as to
make the assertion that all were averse to our
present Governor's renomlnatlon, but If such
were present they failed to show their stand
ard." No, sir,' concluded Mr. Hamilton, with
a shake of . his head, which ! inclined one to
think he meant what he said, 'in all my po
litical experience I cannot recall ( a man who
has held an of flee and at '.l.e same time stood
in such disfavor with his party as does Gov
ernor Gage.' " Â¦ '
P On a recent visit to San Francisco we talked
with nearly a score â eighteen, to be exact â of
members of the Grand Army of the Republic
and the Army and Navy League, and but two
out of the bunch were for Gage. And these
two are office-holders by virtue of Governor
Gage's appointing power. With these two ex
ceptions every voice was â for some : friend?
No. The . invariable answer was, "Anybody
to 'beat Gage. I have no candidate, but Gage
must be beaten for the nomination, or the Re
publican party is beaten at the polls."
Brother Republicans, these be significant
and pregnant facts. Will you heed the signs
Treka Journal:
Some of the Democratic papers. Including
the Redding -Searchlight, are whooping up
Gage for a second term as the ReDubllcan
nominee for Governor, but the Republican del
egates when the convention meets' may stam
pede like the American mules in South Africa,
what Gage 'has done to please the Democrats
we ca:.not say. but we dc? Know that Edson
Is the man to suit the Republicans with gen
eral satisfaction. One term of four years
ought to be enough and no Governor has been
elected twice in this State, except John Blgler
in 1852 and 1854, when the term was only
two years.
Tulare Register:
Our objection to Gage goes chiefly to his
political methods, which are of the machine
order and which are founded upon the several
organized pushes for the several cities of Cal
ifornia and are therefore based on the worst
and not the best elements in our party. We
think it time for Republicans of California to
put politics on a higher level than Mr. Gage
represents, and will therefore oppose his nom
ination, but not with the expectation of bolting
the ticket should he be nominated.
Martinez Daily Press:
Gage will not be the next Governor. We
do not believe that he will be the next Repub
lican nominee for that office. But if we are
mistaken in that, if the machine dominated
by Boss Burns and the attorney who does rot
ten- politics for the associated villainies has
the power as well as the will to outrage
decency by renomlnating Its tool, if the candi
dates for other offices on the Republican ticket
can be cajoled into joining their political for
tunes to a candidate repudiated by respectable
men. If all pretense of political honesty is to
be thrown to the winds and boss-ridden cor
ruption to pursue its reckless course unchecked
in the councils of the Republicaa party. If
these things should appear, then will surely
follow the result apprehended by the national
leaders. A ticket conceived in sin and brought
forth in iniquity will meet its just doom at
the hands ot an outraged and indignant com
munity. It may as weir be' understood -that
the people of . Calif ornla will not be ruled by
a corrupting satrap in the Interest ot rapacious
corporations. They will not have Gage or any
.other man who, is recognized as the tool of
those influences. : And. . there - Is ' no political
alternative which they will not accept to es
cape that subjection. There are respectable
Republicans who can secure for their can
didacy every legitimate Republican influence
and poll every respectable Republican vote. . It
will require such a candidate at the head of
the ticket to win the coming election. It be
hooves those interested In the success of the
Republican party to make sure that It be
led by that kind of a Republican.
Los Angeles Journal:
Each day's developments make it more cer
tain that in the campaign of the fall harmony
will not be spelled with a big H, if the deter-'
minatlon of the Republican bosses to renom
lnate Governor Gage shall materialize. The
San Francisco Chronicle and The Call and the
Los Angeles Times, to say nothing of the more
or less influential papers of the interior that
have echoed their views in this behalf, have
gone too far in denunciation of the executive to
render a retracing of their steps possible. They
indeed have burned the bridges behind them.
And it is certain that their antagonism will
not stop at the doors of the convention. A
united party, with Gage as the standard-bearer,
is unthinkable. The only guarantee of a tri
umph at the polls In November lies in the
abandonment of Gage. The defection 13 so
widspread . and so distinctly defined as to at
tract the attention of national leaders, who fear
the consequences to the party of going into the
campaign with such a handicap. Washington
is becoming alarmed lest the State shall send

The need of .the hour Is a strong personality
with whom to oppose Gage. It Is not easy to>

SAN FRANCISCO, April 6.â Mr. Kdltor:
Tour article on "Gage and the Bosses," April
3, hit the nail on the head, especially the part
referring to patronage, only your scope is
limited. It should also include penal Institu
tions. Â¦ The superintendent of the Preston
School of Industry, Rev. C. B. Rlddick, pre
siding elder of- the South Â¦ Methodist Church,
but ved as an officer, under I General Stonewall
Jackson, but 1b a personal friend of Gage, and
eo for the present is a stanch Republican and
had himself appointed delegate at large to the
San Jose convention. His assistant is Colonel
Austin, who served with distinction in the
Southern army, but for some reason now pro
fesses Republican sympathies. The next en
the list Is the secretary, a . Mr. Preston,' a
foimer newspaper man (you. perhaps, have
heard of him), who also upheld Democratic
principles- until lately, and so It is with every
man In the institution, but at the coming elec
tion they will all be Republicans to vote. for
Gage. -.'.;.
It appears that the Governor is casting
about for available Democrats to manage
the State institutions. These ex-Confed
erates who are holding office at lone are
doubtless worthy citizens, who served in
a gallant army under a great leader,
but why were these distinguished old
Democrats rewarded by Gage? It is com
mon gossip that .the Governor, while
looking to the Republican party for a re
nomination, is looking to the Democratic
party for strength to win In the election.
Gage Takes Care of Democrats.
Additional â¢ Information concerning the
staff at the Preston School ; Is." supplied
by a Call subscriber, who sends this
statement : v .' ." A
The Herald has naught to say against Gov
ernor Gage, and has been and is disposed to re
gard Â¦ the Governor as a fair executive, but if
he appoints to the position of Superintendent
of a State institution a man like the writer of
that article, who makes himself ridiculous by
such fulsome praise, the good opinion heretofore
entertained will be considerably lessened. The
Superintendent of the Preston School needs, a
calling down, and we advise Governor. Gage to
see that it Is done. Keep politics out of schools
of all kinds, and especially out of Institutions
that are supported by the people's money..
These two distinguished citizens visited the
school together in February and looked over
its affairs very carefully. Governor Gage Is a
great favorite in this community. He deserves
all the popular favor bestowed upon him. Cali
fornia never had a better Governor. He has
given the people an honest administration, and
his strict economy has resulted in the smallest
tax rate known for years. More than this, he
is a brainy man, thoroughly informed and with
an intellect clear as a sunbeam. He Is beyond
doubt one of thft greatest lawyers In the State.
He combines, more than is usual, the qualities
that go to make up a great man.
Hon. Mr. Kevane, secretary of the State
Board of Examiners, is a noble coadjutor of the
Governor. If there is an honest man in Cali
fornia it is Daniel Kevane. He has done the
State heroic service in his present responsible
position. We are more than proud to hear that
both of these gentlemen were pleased with the
management of the school.
The Jackson Herald, commenting on
the foregoing, remarks:
The Preston School of Industry at
lone has been completely Kevaned. The
Governor and Hon. Daniel Kevane are
highly praised in the March number of
the Preston School Bulletin. Here Is the
style of adulation:
Preston School of Industry.
The way affairs have been bungled at
the Mendocino asylum ought to- suggest
to the Governor the propriety of detach
ing Johnny Macenzkie from the water
front to adjust things at the Ukiah in
stitution. Johnny is one of the smooth
est of the smooth, and can be relied on
to carry out- a programme with some de
gree of skill. -,."."Â¦Â¦Â¦;
UKIAH. April 8.â Last night at a late hour
Governor Gage called up Major W. W. Cun
ningham, the deposed secretary of the board of
managers of the Mendocino asylum, on the tel
ephone and informed him that he would not be
removed. George L. Smith, his Intended suc
cessor, was here ready to take possession, but
he will have to be otherwise provided for or
stay out in the cold. Somebody evidently put
Governor Gage wise, and be hastened to rectify
Kt vane's error. \
The Herrln-Gage machine is not doing
smooth work at the Mendocino Qounty
Asylum for the Insane. Alex Truman

directors ousted Major W. W. Cunning

pointed in his place George L. Smith of

the command to remove Cunningham.

ROME, April 8.â In spite of the opposi
tion of Cardinal Rampolla, the Papal
Secretary of State, the Pope has decided
to send important special missions both
to the coronation of King Edward and
the festivities In Spain attendant upon
the enthroning of King Alfonso. Tne Car
dinal's opposition to the sending of the
mission to England was based on the
fact that the British Parliament did not
change the anti-Catholic formula of the
accession oath, and Mgr. Merry del Val.
whom the Pontiff designed to be chief of
the missions, openly refused to go while
the present wording of the oath is main
tained.
Nevertheless, the mission will be sent,
and probably will arrive In* London a few
hours after the religious ceremony. This
will be a repetition of the diplomatic
maneuvers carried out at the coronation
of Czar Nicholas II at Moscow.
The question of the advisability of the
papal mission to Spain was due to the
compromises effected by the Queen Re
gent in nominating the Spanish Ambassa
dor to the Vatican as her representative
at â¢ the Pope's jubilee. Under ordinary
circumstances a royal prince would have
been appointed, but he would have been
obliged to also go to the Quirinal, thus
creating a situation full of unpleasant
possibilities.
His Holiness was much displeased at
this step and decided to be represented at
King Alfonso's majority festivities by the
papal nuncio at Madrid. The matter was
smoothed over, however, and it is now
understood that Spain will send a grandee
with an important retinue to specially
Invite the Pope to send a representative,
who probably will be Cardinal Vannutelll
or Cardinal Gretoni, both former nuncios

An entertainment for the. purpose ot
raising funds to be applied to the con

for the use of the clergy of St. Patrick's
Church will be given this evening at Na
tive Sons' Hall. The opera of . "Patience"
has been selected, the members of the
young ladies' and young men's societies
attached to the church furnishing the
cast.
Owing to the great demand for seats.
Father Cummins, the pastor, in order to
afford all his parishioners an opportunity
to enjoy the opera, has advised the young
people to give a second performance the
following night. Acting on thi3 sugges
tion the opera will be repeated to-morrow
night at the same place.
' The new residence will be an ornament
to Mission street, and will be thoroughly
in keeping with the improvements now
being made on that thoroughfare. It will
occupy the entire lot adjoining the church,
and will be 30x80 feet in size and four
stories in height. Architect Charles J.I.
Devlin, who designed the structure, haa
arranged so as to accommodate the
clergy and provide for further increases
in the number of priests that may be at
tached to the parish.
On the first floor will be the parlors, of

Professor Mead says also that- the work
this year in California will deal largely
with a study of the cost and value of
pumping water for irrigation in all parts
of the State. Professor J. M. Wilson,
resident agent of the Department of Ag
riculture, is now making this investi
gation in the Santa Clara Valley. There
Is a gTeat demand for information on this
topic all over the country. Experience
has demonstrated the value of Irrigation
in places where there Is a very heavy an
nual rainfall. The Government will con
tinue to measure the water used .andyesti
mate the value of the crops raised in the
San Joaquin Valley. An agent is in the
valley measuring the weirs this week.
The Department of Agriculture realizes,
so Professor Mead says, that California
has greater opportunities for irrigation
than any other State. The soil will sup
port a vast population when the water
is conserved and properly distributed. The
greater part of the Government work this
year will be performed in Tulare and
Santa Clara counties and in Southern
California. Some drainage surveys may
be made near Fresno, which are much
needed.
Professor Elwood Mead, who is in
charge of the irrigation Investigation of
the Department of Agriculture, says that
the Government" is preparing to give
great publicity to facts concerning irri
gation, problems in California. The report
of last year's work in this State will be
published soon. This will contain a re
port on the auty of water in Soutnern
California, this relating to the amount of
water required to irrigate crops, the
estimate oeing based upon actual meas
urement by civil Engineer Irving at
Riverside. The subject of the utilization
of the water supply of Southern Califor
nia has been treated of by Protessor riil
gard of the University of California. Ir
rigation and fruit growing are treated of
by Professor Wickson. Last year the ir
rigation Investigation looked into the
matter of the returns from irrigation and
the amount of water used in the San
Joaquln Valley for irrigation.
The jury returned a verdict finding
"that the accident was caused by an open
switch, and that the railroad company ii
responsible; that, due precautions -, were
not taken to see that the switch was
properly closed."
"No, sir," replied the witness.
"Then how do you explain this miracle
of a switch securely closed opening itself
and causing a collision?"
The witness answered that he couldn't
explain it, and that the switch was in
perfect order. .
James Phelan, an elderly man of quiet
demeanor, testified that he closed the
switch, as related by the timekeeper, and
that he closed it properly. No, he didn't
believe in miracles, he said, but he was
unable to explain how the switch came to
be open and to ftt the car go on the sid
ing, where the collision occurred. !
Motorman Harry Harrison testified that
he had often seen the switch a little out
of place, perhaps not sufficiently so as
to throw the car upon the siding, but he
took no chances and always had the con
ductor close it. The rules of the company
are to take no chances In such cases- and
that the conductor should get off the car
and "throw the switch," and th'en when
thÂ£ car has passed it to return and re
place the switch as he had found it.
After the collision the witness went back
to the switch and found it open.
Timekeeper Thompson happened to be.
at the switch when the accident took
place. He testified that four minutes be
fore the collision; the switch had been
closed by James Phelan, a track sweeper,
so that the next north-bound car coming
that way could pass along on the straight
track. Thompson swore also that he saw
Phelan arrange the' switch properly, and
that it was not touched afterward by
any person.
"You don't believe in miracles, do you?"
asked the Coroner, dryly.
Coroner Leland expressed his belief to
a jury yesterday that miracles ' do . not
take place in the twentieth century. Two
principal witnesses swore that they did
not believe in miracles, but that a. mira
cle happened when Walter Roland was,
killed on March 30 in a rear-end collision
of two electric cars on the switch siding
on Third street, between King and Town
send.

For some time It has been known that
dandruff Is caused by a germ that dl&s
up the scalp Into little white flakes, and
by sapping the vitality of the hair at the
root causes falling hair, and, of course,
finally baldness. For years there have
been all kinds of hair stimulants and
scalp tonics on the market, but there has
been no permanent cure for dandruff
until the discovery of a. preparation
called Newbro's Herpicide, which . de-
stroys the dandruff germ. Destroy - the
cause, the effect will cease to exist. Kill
the dandruff germ and you'll have no
dandruff, no Itching scalp, no falling
hair.

Roll-call showed no noticeable ab
sentees from the regular crowd. oT race-,
gctrs, and skirmishers possessed such a
good line on horses partial to the heavy
going that the books undoubtedly had
the worst of the argument. â¢
For the opening slx-furlong run Hal
metta wa played at short odds, as if the
result was in. The filly did not take
to the going,, and was not among the
first three. Turning into the stretch, Stu
art, on the 30 to X shot Pirate Maid, took
the lead, winning bands down from Tibs,
a 60 to 1 outsider. Satchel ran third.
Golden Light, with Conley in' the sad
dle, carried some heavy commissions to
win the Futurity course sprint, and bare
ly got up in time to down The Hoodoo a
nose. The price against the latter horse
was backed from 8 to 4. He cut out ail
the pace. . Show honors went to Mar

carrying 109 pounds, showed to be pounds
the best of those lining up in the six and
a half furlong jaunt. She made the run
ning, and only won by a neck from Ish
tar, as Conley came near being caught
napping. Jackson, on the last-named ,
filly, tried a well-timed rush the last hun
dred yards, and the ruse almost caught
the colored rider off his guard. Sir Claus,
quoted at odds of 150 to 1 in the ring, fin.
ished third.-- Botany quit after displaying
a flash of early speed.

1 The general committee was organized in !
September of last year, and.it has been",
hard at work since, ever mindful of two
objectsâ first, that It has to* make ths
visit of the strangers who are to attend
the Supreme Lodge and the Uniform
Rank Encampment a pleasant one, 1 that
will let- them carry away golden opin
ions of the country and of the people,
and, second, that all the efforts put forth
will result in a great advertisement of
California, its possibilities and resources.
The ways and. means committee has done
much to help the general committee,
which has already received liberal con
tributions from the lodges, and has ajoo
received a goodly sifm from entertain
ments, theatrical benefits t and other
sources, which will help swell the grand
entertainment fund. Â¦ : f ;;V . .

RESULTS OF TUESDAY'S EVENTS AT OAKLAND TRACK
Kid "McFadden won from Spider "Welch
In the fifth round of a scheduled flfteen
round bout last^ night at the Reliance
Athletic Club, Oakland/ The red-topped
Kid caueht the Spider with a terrific
rlgM on the jaw in a swinging mix-up
and dazed the lathy fellow. . Welch came
back with determination, only to be met
with a volley of rights and lefts that
â¢weakened him and caused him to toppie.
".Vetch's seconds threw up the sponge
Â¦with their man all but out. Referee IS.
J. Smith declared McFadden the victor.
Welch began operations well. He land
ed three lefts on the Kid's 3aw and t\\o
stiff rights in the heart region during
the first round, but as the bell clanged
the redoubtable freckled fighter rushed
the Spider and punched him to a stand
mill. In the second round neither man
lost any time in getting to work. ' It was
give and take during the three minutes.
McFadden placed several joiters on his
opponent's ribs' and in exchange received
an assortment of lefts in the fiace. Welcli
sent a* powerful left to McFadden's jaw
in the third round that appeared to con
fuse the Kid, but it was only for a mo
ment. The red-top's ire was aroused, and
he went after the long fellow viciously.
The round closed with both boxers pass
ing out to each other the strongest they
could muster. â¢ >>
The fourth round was a hurricane from
the start to the finishing part. It closed
with the battling pair tired. McFadden
jumped out strong In the fifth and started
to ensnare the Spider. He caught the
long fellow with a fierce right, followed
it up with several others and Welch was
all but out when his seconds tossed up
the sponge.
Jim Hamilton of Siockton lost a close
decision to "Jack Capeliss in an eight
round bout that went the limit and which
proved a rattling good mill. Willie
Bourne defeated "Psycho" Collins in
three rounds of a programmed four-round
bout.
The attendance was exceptionally large
and the fights were all hard and good.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. , April 8.â The Tennes
see Derby, at a mile -and an eighth, val
ued at about $6000, was won to-day by
George C. Bennett's Hanover colt Abe
Frank by a neck from Lou Woods. Buc
cleuth finished third, a length away. The
weather was bright and clear and tire
track fast.' About 15,000 people were pres
ent. Only four starters faced the flag,
Ed Austin and H. L. Coleman declining;
the issue.
Abe Frank was held at the prohibitive
odds of 1 to 6; Lou Woods, with Nash
Turner in the saddle, was second choice
at 6 : to* 1,- while Buccleuth sold at eights
and tens. At the second attempt Starter
Fitzgerald caught the field in perfect line
and dropped the flag. Winkfleld took Buc
cleuth to the front Â«at the start, and,
closely "followed by Red Hood and Abe
Frank, made the running for a mile.
When the horses turned for home Co
burn sent the favorite forward, and it
looked. as If he would win in a romp, but
at the Â¦ sixteenths pole Lou Woods came
with a rush which sent Coburn to the
whip. The finish was Â¦ a hard one, with
Abe Frank in front by a neck. . It was
the general opinion that the Bennett
horse was a little short in his work. It
is claimed a large commission was sent to
Chicago after the race on his chances
for the American Derby. Summary: f ,'â¢*>

m T^ Se is sole master of Uhe field
this season^ and he will stanffor no.kick
ing or back talk from any of the Payers.
iJfst season the players acted as they
pleased, and consequently jartouf trou
bles arose between them and the u mP*Â«Â»
and managers. The management prom
ises the strictest discipline in the "rture.
and any player who shows a tendency
to take objection to the umpire's rulln*
will be severely dealt with; When he is
fined, he must pay the penalty, as a law
has been passed forbidding any club man
ager refunding fines to his Players.
Bone's throwing-arm Is a trifle sore,
having been broken In a game of polo In
the East. He thinks it will be all right
In a few. days. It showed no signs oÂ£
weakness in the two games he has al
re re MtredIth posltlvely assures Manager
Harris he will remain with the locals.
He "admits he has received numerous of
fers from Eastern clubs, but says he likes
California and. will not jump. His arm
Is not in good condition by any means,
but he says as soon aa- the weather gets
warmer it will come around air right.
The patrons of the game will have a
chance to see Kane, Harris* lanky south
pi w, act to-day. Kane has the reputa
tion of throwing balls in the grandstand
while aiming at the plate. Harris will
give him a chance to make good, and he
hopes Kane will eventually overcome his
wildness. If he does, he should prove
one of the most effective twirlers In tha
league. â¢
Hickey, who will oppose Kane, is an
other man ' whose movements will be
anxiously watched. Hickey comes from
the Pacific Northwestern League and is
said to-be a wonder. He U a young fel
low, big and husky, and Mike Fisher
expects great things of him.

about the match was to raise funds to
send the California track team East.
Part of, the receipts of the game woufctl
be treed for that purpose and part used
in defraying the expenses of training the
cardinal athletic teams. Stanford's
faculty baseball team is already organ
ized and is able to put up a good* exhibi
tion' of the national game. It Is com
posed of the following professors: How

shortstop; Newson, catcher; Kellogg,
Â¦ pitcher and third base; G. H. Marx, cen
ter field; Foster, right field; Jordan, first

he had the dead man's bankbook showing
that McNea' had J2500 on deposit at tho
Hibernia Bank. Â¦ =
: McNea first went to Washington; where
he made money out of Government tim
ber lands, and tried to increase his for
tune by investing in realty when- the
boom struck Puget Sound. ~ But he failed
utterly, and his little pile was swept
away. Then he went to San Francisco,
became a peddler and sold fruits Â¦: and
vegetables to people on this side of tho
bay. He lived at the What Cheer House
in the city and stored his earnings in the
Hlbernia Bank.
'-. The McNeas lived on a ' farm' near
Fleshington, Canada. There were eleven
children born to them and some of them
were old enough in 1861-65 to help the
Union flght its battles , with \the South.
The head of the family yearned to come
to -California. He wanted to. sell, the
farm, but his consort was of an opposite
mind. She would never yield to the im
portunities to sign her name to a release
of the homestead. At last MqNea de
spaired of persuading her and one day
he disappeared. That day was the 15th of
November, : 1872â his . son remembers the
day because he began then to count' the

lor more than thirty years, yet walked
among the living until death overtook him
a few years ago.

Major Horace Bell, who is commonly
supposed to be engineering the Shafter
boctn, said that General Shafter had let
it be known that he would accept the
semination 'or Governor under certain
conditions. What these conditions . arc
could not be ascertained.
LOS ANGELES. April fc.â There seems
to be little foundation for the story sent
cut from Los Angeles making the state
ment that ilaior General W. R. Shafter
(retired) Is a candidate for Governor.
Colonel Daubenspeck. president of the
Airoy. and Navy League Club, said to
night that while General Shafter' s name
had been mentioned at an informal meet
ir>s cf the Army and Navy League's
lcrly-four delegates to the San Jose con
vention, there had been absolutely no
action taken. In fact, said Colonel Daub
er-jbpeck. the matter was not given seri
ous thought-
When his attention was called to the
provision in the constitution of the State
to the effect that a retired army officer,
if elected to a State office, would be
obliged to resign from the army and the
I>ay rcll as such retired omcer General
rihafter said that he would not withdraw
Irom his position to accept the Governor
ship.
"So," he said again as he was about
to join his party awaiting him, "my name
will not be given out as a candidate or a
probable candidate for the office."
"Many of my army friends would be
glad to see me in the gubernatorial chair,
but 1 must disappoint them. I have no
reason to believe that I would be suc
cessful should 1 consent to be a candi
date, for while my army friends Â¦Â¦ are
stanch their numbers are such that their
efforts In my behalf might not carry the
l>oira which some of them have seemed
determined to put to the test."
"1 have no intention of trying for the
office or the nomination." he said this
evening. "This has all come about
through a letter written to me by one of
my old army friends stating that I was
talked of as a candidate for the nomina
tion. While I appreciate the kindness of
my friends I can state positively that my
name will not be used in the list of prob
able nominees, nor will I try to obtain the
nomination or permit my name to be pre
sented.

Covert had nearly $200 in gold and two
watches on ' his person. The couple, who
had just arrived from Chicago, had three
trunks and two valises.
-A few days ago Covert called at the
home of S. R. Howe, a wealthy mine
owner, who had recently returned to Chi
cago from Alaska, where he has consid
erable property. Howe brought with him
from Alaska many untanned skins, seal,
ottoi and mink, which he presented to his
invalid .wife. During Howe's temporary
absence from home Covert presented
himself at the house as a secret service
detective and after securing $1000 worth
of furs, made his escape. The police were
notified, but Covert got away and was not
heard of until hfa arrest last evening. It
is supposed by the police that the trunks,
which have not yet been examined, con
tain the stolen property.

She taid not. but was gradually growing
worse. The doctor was coming twice a
day and giving her a powerful nervine.
She Â£aid: "I am so miserable that I 'tell
you privately If I don't get better soon I
will end it all myself some day.'. I told
her not to talk that way, for I believed
It was somethinsr she ate or drank that
caused the trouble and she might . get
well by making a change In her diet. I
told her my cwn experience in leaving oft
cofff-e when I was In almost as bad a
the.pe as she, but as soon as I mentioned
coffee I had a fight on my hands, for ehe
insisted that coffee helped her and her
mother backed her In it, saying that it
was 'the only thing she did enjoy' and
Â¦â¢she did not believe coffee hurt any one.'
'â¢I talked with them a long time and
finally ect Cora to agree to let me make
a cup of PoBtum Food Coffee for her
cupper. She was surprised that it was so
good. Said the. 'Had heard It was ter-
rible wishy-washy stuff.' I told -her it
was because they did not follow directions

it faithfully for two or three weeks and

I was wrong. . . . Â¦

When Brandt arrived at the firm's office
at the corner of Beale and Bryant streets
with his necessary legal documents, he
saw Charles K. Dugan, secretary of the
Crescent City Transportation Company,
in the act of handing a check for $SÂ»25 to
the firm's bookkeeper. The check was
drawn in payment for certain shares of
the transportation company, which ha a
been transferred by Preston &. McKm
non. As soon as Brandt's eagle eye per
ceived the check, he garnisheed It on bo
half of Mrs. Wall, much to the chagrin
of the bookkeeper.

the sum of J7TS6 S5, alleged to be due her

Mr. McKinlay said that the men could
not have been indicted for refusing to
obey orders, because the only punishment
provided for that offense is confinement
by the master on board the vessel on a
bread and water diet, hence they were
indicted for conspiracy.
They -xere defended by 1'oUco Commis
sioner llutton and >'. C. West, the prose
cution being conducted by Second Assist
ant United States district Attorney Dun
can E. McKinlay. The jury after having
been out for fifteen minutes returned a
verdict of not guilty, the prosecution,
while establishing the fact that 'the de
fendants refused to go to work when
ordered to do so by the first mate, failed
to show that the men had entered into a.
conspiracy tor that purpose.
The men, Charles Pickett, Fred D. Rob
ertson. Patrick O. Dwyer and Christopher
Arnstod, with three others who were not
prosecuted, refused to obey an order
given by First Mate Walter Larsen on
.November 19, while the Reaper was lying
in the harbor of Manila. The order was to
removt some scantling from the top of
Â«..e cabin. While it aid not come out on
the trial, the fact was that the men did
not want to perform what they deemed
to be stevedores' work, and a principle
of labor unionism was the corner stone
of their refusal.
Four sailors from the American bark
Reaper were placed on trial before a jury
yesterday in the United States District
Court on a charge of having conspired to
c.isobey the commands of the masier and

H. E. Averill, a mining man, living" at
240 Montgomery street, secured a warrant
from. Judge Mogan yesterday for the ar
rest of A. D. Bowley on the charge of
felony embezzlement. He alleges that on
December 4 last he gave Bowley 300 shares
of Central .Eureka mining stock, valued
at $315, to. sell within thirty days and that
since then Bowley has failed to return
the stock or give any account of it.
Dispute About Mining' Stocks.
I Twenty soldiers belonging to the Seven
tenth Infantry, who were arrested on Pa
cific street Monday, night for pushing
pedestrians off the sidewalk and otherwise
raising a disturbance, s appeared - before
Judge Fritz yesterday. â¢ The Judge con
victed them and sentenced each to pay a
fine of $5, with the alternative of serving
twenty-four hours in prison. The Judge
warned them that if they were again ar
rested he would punish them more* se
verely.
Soldiers on the Rampage.
The executive committee of the Western
Passenger Association Â¦ has decided. to re
quest the Comptroller, of the Treasury to
instruct the quartermaster general of the
army to specify in the future whenever
asking for bids whether the contracts are
for the transportation of troops and the
amount of baggage allotted to each sol
dier. The railroad companies do not ob
ject to hauling wearing apparel of the
soldiers, ' but protest that j. cannon and
horses are not personal^ baggage.
About "ten years ago the Southern Pa
cific Railroad was sustained by the Gov
ernment in its contention that soldiers
have no personal baggage and that every
thing in the possession of the soldiers
when traveling is really owned by the
Government. Â¦Â¦ The Government reversed
that ruling, however, about three years
ago. The Government now demands that
the railroads must carry 150 pounds of
military equipment to every soldier. As a
result the roads have been compelled to
carry cannon, rapid-firing guns and even
horses. Â¦
The' Government has insisted; that the
usual allowance of 150 pounds of baggage
made by the railroads to the general pub
lic be made for each soldier carried. For
example, if 100 soldiers and a freight car
load of. military equipment are transport
ed, the Government insists that a > reduc
tion of 15,000 pounds be made from, the
carload weight and that it pay regular
freight rates only on the remainder.
.. The manipulators of the transcontinen
tal roads have commenced to retaliate on
the 'Federal Government for their;prose
cution in reference to pooling. One of the
first moves the railways of the West will
make will to make a protest against
hauling cannon, ammunition and supplies
on passenger trains or recognizing* them
as baggage. ,, './ , f- / , .

LIVERPOOL.
NEW YORK. Arrll 8.â The effect of yester
day's flurry in the money market was dissi
pated to-day and an aggressive leadership was
developed on the recovery In stocks. This lead
ership seemed to remain with the Western men
who took hold of the market late last week.
There was some evidence that their forces had
been recrnited from other sources; while their
pceiticn was stronger by reason of the shaking
off of a weak following by yesterday's re
action. The extension of tho short fhtercsf
during yesterday's decline was also a technical
factor of strength in to-day's market. " The re
assurance of the speculative element, was not
imminent this morning and there was consid
erable wavering and- unmtalnty in ThV early
movement of prices. In fact there was not
much in the market up to noon outside of tne
persistent absorption of Louisville and Nash
ville and the sharp advance in Amalgamated
Copper, apparently a continuation of yester
day's movement. Louisville and Nashville
proved the central figure of the market and its
aggressive advance waa the dominating factor
in the broadening demand for stock*. The
dealings m the Block were on an enormous
tcale and there were Indications that the
*We*tern contingent of speculators was rein
forced on the buying side by a well-known ope
rator who only recently returned from a long
trip to recuperate his health. The explana
tions offered for the ri3e were mostly in the na
ture of surmises on the part of speculators.
The reported acquisition of the Atlanta. Knox-
Mtle and Northern Hallway was believed to be
the preliminary to active incursions into new
territory. The belief was professed that the
new iesue of $5,000,000 of stock for the purpose
of this purchase already has been marketed,
thus freeing the market from the future offer
ings of it. The aggressive policy undertaken
by the company gave rise to conjectures as to
the possibilities of the establishment of a
community of Interest In the territory con
cerned. Illinois Central and Southern Hallway
preferred were benefited by sympathy. The
movement spread into the Southwestern stocks
and St. Paul, but Union Pacific. Southern Pa
cific and Atchlson were little affected by the
movement. There was a general movement in
the Vanderbilts of from one to three points,
and a large number of minor stocks, of which
the Wisconsin Central stocks were most con
spicuous, were vigorously advanced. The list
of minor industrials advanced was as large aa
has recently been the rule. The Westlnghouse
Electric stocks made sensational advances of
14% for the common and 15 for the first pre
ferred on the strength of an analogy with the
history of General Electric. The whole market
gave way on. the profit taking which developed
in the last hour and the principal active stocks
were csrriird back from 1 to 2 points. The
market closed easy. The rate for call loans
to-day held firm tit 5 to 0 per cent. It was
believed that this rate would check future
ehipments of gold, and this assurance was a
considerable relief to sentiment. The- calling
of loans yesterday seemed to have strength
ened the situation of the banks so far that the
fteling in tie money market to-day was much
Quieter. Â¦' .
The bond market was rather quiet, but firm.
Total sales, $3,770,000. Â¦ . â¢
Unifed States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call. "

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
i 1000 boxes, and every receiving house in*, town
! had. a ".full floor ' in consequence. Thua far
j orders for the northern coast and the "North
western Â¦ States and Territories have kept the
market from breaking, but yesterday's dose
was a large one for the market to digest. A3
soon as quotations drop a little more the com
mission merchants will start In to pack, but
they do not care to risk their money at pres
ent , prices. The feeling Is naturally weak un
der the circumstances. Â¦ : Â¦ -
Receipts : of Eggs . were also very large? as
will be seen, and though prices stood the same
the feeling" continued weak. Storing continues,
and this is .the- only, thing , that, keeps prices
where they are. Â¦ , :
â¢ The shelves continue freely supplied with
Cheese, but .the market is steady at previous
prices. - Â¦ . ' Â¦ Â¦ ' .
Receipts were 0O.S00 Dounds. 61 tubs and 1
keg of Butter, 2231 cases of Eggs. '8100 pounds
of California Cheese, pounds of Oregon
Cheese and pounds of Eastern Cheese.

j All grades of Oranges were reported steady
at unchanged ' prices and other Citrus Fruits
stood about the same. Four cars of Oranges
will be auctioned . to-day. '
Banaras met with ready sale at the quoted
price.' Offerings are not very large and higher
prices are' looked for. as the trust has in
creased the prica at New Orleans.

Leicester was anxious to hear more con
cerning that affair, and. in answer to his
questions Mrs. Bell said Maxwell . had the
letters in his pocket when confronted by
the detectives. He gave them up after
seme show of force -was made. Mrs. Bell
said the letters were taken from the of
fice safe; the key of which was in Max
well's possession.
"It was Maxwell," went on the witness,
"whom the detectives caught taking let
ters from the safeâ letters concerning the
Mazatlan property."
"Strike that out." said the court.
The court objected to dragging Max
well's name into the controversy, he be
ing in no wise connected therewith.
Caught Taking Papers From the Safe.
"I do not," was the tart reply. "I only
know that while he was executor his
principal business was to get away with
the Bell estate."
"I mean to say that the Bell estate
Â¦was .worth $1,250,000 when they took
cfcarge of it, and -that they turned over
a small portion of that sum."
"Do you know the business in which
Staacke Is "engaged?" ;Â¦->-,'
"Did you not know they were respon
sible to you for all the papers In the of
ficer'
"1 knew they were responsible for the
entire estate." replied Mrs. Bell, sharp
ly, "but they turned very little of ft
over to me."
"Do you mean to say they were
thieves?" inoulred Leicester.
"I heard of such a statement, but when
my attorney called upon him with refer
ence to it, he declined . to consider the
matter."
"Do you know that of your own per
sonal knowledge, madam?" asked the
court.
"Xti, sir; I was told so by my attor
ney."
The matter was stricken out,, and the
witness asked to explain the why
ene had paid the Morse detective agency
$150 on April 6. 1300.
"I wanted the papers of the Bell es
tate guarded," replied the witness. "Both
Staacke and John Maxwell had keys io
the office, and after Staacke's removal
as executor it was necessary to preserve
the documents in my office."
"Were you not informed that Attorney
Drown had made a statement to that ef
fect?" '
WJiy the Detectives Were Km ployed.
Mrs. Bell said she thought the fee was
extremely reasonable, considering the
vast work done by Blakeman in collecting
the money for the estate. In the matter
of the Laguna ranch, which .became the
property of Miss L. J. Thompson on fore
closure and for the restitution of which
on the grounds of collusion and fraud
suit is now pending, the witness said she
was not aware thaf Miss Thompson was
willing to sell the property back to the
estate for what it cost her.
"Yes, sir, the case Executor Staacke
tried to settle with the attorneys for the
Robinson case for $2500.". . i
"For services in the collection of the
Robinson claim of $41,000," replied the
witziess. "I thought the fee was a very
reasonable one, inasmuch as he succeed
ed in collecting so large a sum."
â¢ "You say this was the Robinson estate
case?" asked the court.
The matter was settled by the court ex
cusing Davis, and the examination of
Mrs. Bell by Leicester then began. She
was questioned at length upon the vari
ous items of expenditures which were
contested by the creditors. The item of
$1000 paid to Attorney Brewton A. Hayne
as counsel for the minor Bell heirs was
inquired into, but Mrs. Bell cut off de
bate with the statement that this sum
was paid by her out of her family alow
ance and that there was no voucher
therefor.
The fees of Blakeman as attorney for
the Witness were next inquired Into, par
ticularly one of $5000 on December 13. 1900.
"What was that paid for?" Inquired
Leicester. ; -
Mrs. Bell oa the Witness Stand.
Attorney Leicester asked that a wit
ness, Davis by name, be excused until
further orders of the court. Blakeman
was asked to state what he expected to
prove by Davis and his reply created the
first commotion of the day.
"I intend to show," answered Blake
man coolly, "that the firm of Drown,
Leicester & Drown while representing a
client with whom the Bell estate is now
in litigation also represents the creditors
of the estate. I will also show that the
firm solicited the creditors for their busi
ness and secured contracts â "
"I object!" Interrupted Attorney Lei
cester. "That is a matter foreign to this
issue, and counsel has no right to refer
to it."
"I was merely telling you what I ex
pected to prove by Witness Davis," said
Blakerr.an.
After the preliminary matters relative
to the proceedings were disposed of by
counsel, . Blakeman placed Mrs. Bell on
the witness stand -and she Identified her
annual account, together with the vouch
ers accompanying it.
ThÂ» hearlns: of the contest of the cred

Teresa Bell, the administratrix, on the
ground that certain items of expenditure
charged therein were excessive, was pro

TWO ALLEGED OPIUM SMUG
GLERS AND THEÂ£ POLICE
MEN WHP ARRESTED THEM.
POLICE Officers A. O. Juel and E.
"C." Gould captured -two opium
smugglers yesterday and secured
their plunder. The officers will
very likely receive a substan
tial reward from the Government. The
men arrested were John Gavin, alias Mur
phy, and Joseph Kirk, alias Duffy. Both
men are known to the Federal authori
ties as being dangerous men. They were
taken to the Hall of Justice and held un
til the proper papers could be drawn up
so as to hold them in the County Jail. . .
9 No Clams in Basket.
The capture of these men is. due to the
observing: qualities possessed by Officer
Juel. * The latter and Officer Gould were
on their way home at 6 o'clock yesterday
morning, and were waiting at. Lotta's
fountain for an outgoing Market-street
car. Juel happened to notice two rough
looking men on a northbound Third-street
car that was on its way out Kearny
street. He saw that the men were cov
ered with mud, and that they, had three
telescope baskets in their possession. The
eerly hour, coupled with the dilapidated
appearance of the men and baskets, led
Juel to investigate. He called to Gould,
and both sprinted after the moving car.
They boarded the back platform and
walked through the car to the front por
tion, where the men were seated. The
officers were in citizens' clothes. Juei
questioned the men, and their answers
were evasive.-. :.,..-Â¦ Â¦ .â¢Â¦Â¦.. \.' â¢'".'.
"What have you got there?!? asked the
officer, "<;lams?" Â¦ . ; .â¢â¢
"No," said one of the fellows, sullenly.
"Do they belong to you?" asked Juel,
indicating the " baskets. Â¦ Â¦
"No; they belong 1 to a friend of mine,"
answered the spokesman.
During the conversation Gould made .a
closer investigation. He poked his finger
through the aperture and came in con
tact with a tin.., It dawned on him that it
was opium, and he so informed his broth
er officer.
When the car was in front of the Hall
of Justice Juel pulled out his star and
told Kirk and Gavin he was an officer
Both men bear unsavory reputatlonF.
Gavin was badly wounded by a customs
officer while trying to smuggle opium at
Honolulu. Kirk is believed to have been
a member of the Romula gang of opium
smugglers .who operated some years . ago.
He is recognized by the local inspectors
as the man /who avoided ' capture at J the.
It developed during the day that Kirk
is Employed as fireman on board the City,
of Puebla. which arrived at this port on
Monday.. Gavin was formerly employed
oh the same boat. The theory of the Fed
eral officers is that Kirk and Gavin are
members of a gang of smugglers who
have been operating on this coast for the
last six months. Their plan is to secure
the opium at Victoria- ' The stuff is
brought from China by one; of the gang
and transferred to Kirk when his' vessel
stops at -Victoria,
Supposed to Be Members of ,Bing.
and ordered them to come with him.
Gavin made plight resistance, but Gould
hauled him off the, car in a hurry. The
officers brought their men and plunder to
the Chiefs office, and a closer examina
tion of the baskets revealed 230 flve-tael
cans of opium. The men were Hakeh to
the City Prison on the top floor of the
Hall of Justice, and were booked. They
gave their names as John Duffy and
Joseph Murphy. Collector of the Port
Stratton was notified of the capture, and
ho detailed his clerk, Ellis A. Holmes, to
place the opium under seizurd. The -Dis
trict Attorney's office was notified, and
a complaint was drawn- up and sworn to
by Officer Gould. Late in. the afternoon
the men. were taken to the County Jail,
where they will be held on three counts.
A committee of the Grand Jury, consist
ing of Jurors Culen, Woodward and
Roche, will accompany Commissioner
Casey of the Board of Works and inspect
the premises.
After the members of the Board. of Pub
lic Works had made their explanations,
Chairman. Sonntag said:
"We do not want excuses, we want ac
tion." Â¦
Â¦. Tessmer told the members of the Grand
Jury that ever since the Board of Public
Works r had been appointed he' had been
trying to get these fences, which inclose
a. cowyard. removed, but had not yet suc
ceeded. He 'said the Board of Public
Works had ordered the streets opened,
but found so many engineering difficulties
injhe way that they could not see how
it could be done: Tessmer claimed that
all that was needed was the construction
of a small bridge and the removal of one
or two fences. Â¦Â¦...Â¦Â¦ - - - .. Â¦
Commissioners Mendell. Mar.sden and
Casey of the Board of Public Worka
were called in together. They had sent
a long letter to the Grand Jury, explain
ing that conflicting, ordinances, resolu
tions and bills so confused their minds
that they were necessarily slow in doing
much-needed . work. This letter - was in
reply to a complaint made by H. Tess
mer,'Who resides in the Bay View dis
trict, at 1121 Thirty-fifth avenue South.
Tessmer has lived in the neighborhood
for thirty years, but cannot get easy ac
cess to his house by reason of the fences
that obstruct Thirty-fourth and Thirty
fifth avenues and K street. . '

The Police Commissioners notified the
Grand Jury that hereafter the first part
of their sessions would be devoted to the
consideration of saloon licenses, and all
other matters would be relegated to the
end of the session. This also 'met with
the approval of the Grand Jurors. Both
bodies exchanged compliments at the con
clusion of the visit.
Police Commissioners Newhall, Howell,
Mahoneyand Hutton were specially sum
moned to have a heart to heart talk with
the , Grand . Jurors. There < were many
matters to discuss, and the four commis
sioners were 'closeted in the jury-room
for nearly an hour, while the members of
the Board of Public Works, who had also
been summoned, cooled themselves in the
ante-room. â¢ ,.- . .
One result of the conference was the
announcement by the Police Commission
ers to the Grand Jury that they were
thoroughly- in accord with' any and all
efforts to . suppress gambling.*
"These gambling hells arc doomed,",
said Foreman Sonntag.
' "We hope they are," responded the Po
lice Commissioners in a body. "We will
help you all we can." Â¦Â¦'. . Â¦
Then- consideration was 'given to the
matter of drug stores and candy stores
selling liquor without a license. It -was
decided thatV"ice cream soda: with a
wink,'!, or Â¦ , "acid phosphates with just a
taste of brandy," should not be so easily
obtainable as heretofore, unless the pro
prietors of the' two classes of' business
should pay a license commensurate with
that of the retail liquor dealer. It was
also suggested i that where ' restaurants
sold liquor, the license should be in
creased. â¢ , Â¦ . â¢Â¦ Â¦ ' ' Â¦' -. , . Â¦.-.â¢..
â¢; Whereas, The reported bribery on the part
of the police force was circulated 'throughout
the . land by .; publication in I the newspapers of
the country and 'that said publication and cir
culation . of ! the : story :-. has caused the good
name and reputation of the Board of Civil
Service Commissioners and â¢ the Police Depart
ment of. the city to be questioned, as also that
of prominent witnesses in the caser now, there
fore, be it .. . > -:Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦'.
Â¦ Itesolved, By the Grand Jury of the city and
county of San Francisco. That after a roost
careful, thorough and . free examination we
find no truth whatever in the story circulated
by Mr. Ohnlmus; we further find that no police
officer has ever subscribed or been called upon
to subscribe to any fund to be used for the
purpose of- promoting: their examination before
the Board of Civil Service Commissioners; We
further find that no member of the Board of
Civil Service .Commissioners or O?ief Ex
aminer Moran, was ever offered, recefved. de
manded or asked for, nor was he ever promised
any sum of money whatever for his influence
or assistance in . the : examinations had before
the board. . Â¦ . . ' â¢
. The charge as presented by Mr. Ohnlmus.
having cast a reflection upon the hone&ty, in
tegrity and efficiency / of the Board of Civil
Service Commissioners' and the Police Depart
ment of this city and county, we the Grand
Jury 'of the said city and county , refute the
charge as being without truth or foundation
and we do hereby fully, exonerate the said
Board of Civil Service Commissioners I and the
Police Department from any and all connection
in the matter "whatever. Respectfully Bub

that a fund. of $6000 was being raised -to
influence .the commission, of which he i3
a member, in the matter of police promo
tions. The public, put little faith in the
story, but. the Grand â¢ Jury felt it duty
Â¦ bound | to : investigate the . matter. What
the I Grand j Jurors, thought about it is em
bodied in 'the, report of a committee,
which was unanimously adopted. The re
