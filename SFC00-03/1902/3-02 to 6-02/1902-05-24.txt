CONSTERNATION reigns in San Quentin Prison. A scandal which, in its proportions, in its revelation of- wholesale: cruiic ; has had fczv equals in this State, has burst over the institution, involving Warden Martin G. Aguirrc and
Henry T. Gage, the Governor, of California. .Warden Aguirrc has been guilty of, gross crimes and Governor ' Gagi v 'his^friend, j associate,' and adviser, has been the beneficiary of these criminal acts. The State treasury has been
systematically and craftily robbed by a gigantic ring, of whick Warden Aguirrc. .is the inspiration^ been purchased zvilh the money of the State, and fraud, forgery, mis
representation, deceit, dishonest bookkeeping and the consummate craft of Warden Aguirrc have blinded the PrisonWiKcetors 'to' the crimes and- have filched dollars dishonestly icon from the treasury of the State.
At the direction of the prison authorities convicts, expert in forgery, have been employed :to fqrgc.bills upon the. ficnitaitiary, to substitute dishonest demands for honest ones;- to make false entries in the prison books, to conceal
criminal transactions in the maze of crooked bookkeeping, in order that the family of ' Govcrno) â¢Gage, through the criminal'>assistanccof\JVardcn Aguirrc, might thrive upon a dishonoring bounty.
Convicts have been employed to' manufacture the most costly furniture, which has been sent by W : aÂ£day:*Ag$}r^ city and elsewhere. Â¦ A mammoth nest cf official thievery, upon

Special Correspondence for The Call.
WASHINGTON, May 23.â The Housel
devoted thÂ© day to private pension bllla
and to a few other minor measures. Loud
of California criticized the special pension
legislation as a disgrace and drew em
phatic, responses from SuIIoway of New
Hampshire, Sulzer of New York and Mlera
of Indiana, In all 105 private pension bills
were passed. The House adjourned until
Monday in order s to participate in the
Rochambeau exercises to-morrow.
Upon the convening of the House "Wads
worth of New York presented the confer
ence report on the- agricultural bill for
printing in the record, according to tha
rule yesterday, and gave notice that he
would call It up on .Monday next. Tho
: following bills were passed: To redlvide
the district of Alaska into three recording
and judicial districts. -\ For., the- promotioa
of First Lieutenant .Joseph. Jfc. Simras.
revenue cutter service. The 'House dis
agreed to the Senate amendment to the
bill to prevent the false branding or mark-
Ing of'food or dairy products and" asked
for a conference.
The House then proceeded to the con
sideration of private pension bills. Loud
declared that pension legislation had gone
far beyond the point of reason and had
become a disgrace \o this legislative body.
He said it waa physically impossible for
the committee reporting these bills to
consider them carefully, as 1169 had been
received at this session and passed, within
a total of twenty-eight hours.
Chairman Sulloway of tbÂ« committea
asserted that the bill had the most care
ful consideration. He paid a tribute to
the old soldiers as. the warriors of the
nation, who should be protected in their
old age and never be permitted to enter
an alms institution. Sulzer and Miera
also paid tributes to the old soldie- ' k
Miers said it was an alternative betwt. I
this legislation and "over tho hills to tÂ» I
poorhouse." Sulzer emphatically protesteuf
against the slandering of the men who
followed the flag and declared that it waa
the duty of every patriotic Representative
to stand behind the old soldier.
A spirited contest occurred between
Sulzer of New York and Hull of Iowa
when the latter sought to defeat one of
Sulzer's. relief bills to relieve the charge
of desertion against Michael Mullet. The
isew York member declared that Hull, as
chairman of the Military Committee waÂ»
seeking to punish him for a vote on ona
of the military bills. Hull denied any
such, purpose and asserted that Sulzer'a
relief bill was without merit and had been
reported as a personal favor, and when
the House sided with Sulzer Hull pre*
vented final action by raising: the poiufi
of no Guorum. "

The Senator asked: "Don't you know
that' at the (time of the war^ with Spain
the Filipino people were in reyolt against
the Spanish Government?"
"That was true at Manila but not e!se-
W "\Vell, then, don't you think that the
consent of the people themselves should
have been secured before we assumed tne
responsibility of their Government?
"I don't think it safe to make any ef
fort to get their consent until affairs are
better established than at present. The
average Filipino would not know what to
say if approached on the subject. If he
should speak out for American rule he is
liable to have his throat cut.
Senator Carmack asked a number of
questions concerning the comparative suc
cess of. American missionaries in Asia.
The- Bishop replied that he.did not con
sider their success due entirely 'to the
fact that'heretof ore the United States has
not been, a nation of conquest and declar
ed it was due largely to the popular man
â¢nefS or the Americana. They are, he said,

have, he said, always been popular, and

The matter of the witnes&'-oplnion as- to
our right by force to subjugate .another
people was gone into at lengtn /by Senator
Culberson, when the witness-aaid: ; . .
-Dubois in his. speech, having- contended
that if Governor.Taft should die. or other
members, of the 'able-Pnilippine
- Beveridge replied . that the i trade was
greater with "free nations" because only
of the lower consuming power of the de
pendencies, v-' Â¦.
. Hoar of Massachusetts inquired of.Bev
eridge if Great Britain had a larger export
trade- with. her. dependencies or.with-free
nations. . Â»J8aÂ»vt-;JBWÂ»isaMi'*jsÂ»3R*s i .'u.
-Admitting that fact. Beveridge said the
reason for it was that Great Britain, hav
ing long enjoyed a monopoly of the ex
port trade to her - dependencies,- : had
grrown careless, - and other nationsâ the
United States and Germanyâ more active
and enterprising, slowly had been under
minini? England's foreign : trade.
Beveridge said that -Great Britain sold
to her dependencies .each year; products
amounting to $500,000,000, , and he felt that
that sort of trade was worth striving for.
Carmack pointed "out that Great Brit
ain's-trade had been 'declining 1 while that
of the United States' had constantly been
Increasing. ' â¢ â¢. â¢ "~ â -.-
Beveridge of . Indiana declared ' that the
whole argument of the Idaho Senator -had
been made ; for the purpose of frighten
ing the American people with the dragon
of China. Dubois had maintained that
when China had adopted modern methods
in the development of Its . resources it
would supply, not only its, own needs, but
those of the world. If Â¦ that were true,
Beveridge <held, then it would be true that
the United States ought not to encourage
the development Â¦ of . any I country. He
urged that that was not true.
The exports to^ China from outside coun
tries amounted to about J250.00O.00O a year
and he believed that 'it would be possible
easily for the" United âcates to secure one
half of that trade. - The- Philippines, he
maintained, , were a. door to the Chinese
trade. -, ; -'--.--'v'ir â¢ Â¦'â¢Â¦
BEVERIDGE MAKES REPLY
, Dubois asserted that within six months
after Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma
were admitted to statehood, the profit to
the manufacturers of .the United States
in their trade with any one of. the new
States would be greater than the com
bined profits on all of their trade with the
Philippines and other Oriental countries.
The total trade of the United States
with the Philippine Islands, he said, waa
about $5,000,000 a year. We had spent
more^money in , the Philippine war than
all the trade of the islands with the Unit
ed States / would amount, to in a hundred
and fifty years, and every day we remain
ed in the islands our loss would be'In
creased. , 'Â¦ Â¦'- Â¦ -'Â¦ Â¦â¢â¢'
Agricultural development would induce
Industrial activity and manufacturing es
tablishments would spring up and com
pete with us not only for the trade of the
islands, but also for China and the Straits
Settlements, and- eventually, owing to
cheap labor, would compete with our own
manufactured, goods fn all parts of the
world. ' Â¦';' Â¦ ,Â¦ . Â¦
Dubois declared that feature of the bill
which permitted corporations to take up
5000 acres of land in the- Philippines for
agricultural purposes ought to be stricken
out, he believing that under It the rich
est lands ultimately would . fall into the
hands of great syndicates, thus encourag
ing a tremendous production . of cane
sugar, cotton and tobacco.
"The dragon is sleeping quietly now,"
said Dubois. "The monaier is inert Sur
rounded with a conservatism of centuries.
Looking to the interest of the white labor
race of the world, are we pursuing a
right course in awakening this sleeping
dragon?" . . " . '
Dubois believed there was no hooe" of
profitable trade relations with the Orient
or the Philippines if the islands were
managed ami exploited cs contemplated
in the pending bill.- A few individuals
might reap a profit, but it would be at an
enormous expense to the United States
and especially, to the laborers, the manu
facturers and the farmers. y â¢â¢ Â»LÂ»<
DEAGON IS NOW SLEEPING
Dubois isald* trie RepablJcMv policy was
to hold tne islands for all time as a col
ony and to/exploitj them for the advan
tage and gain -of our own people. Tne
minority intend to gjve. tne people an in
aepehdentr' (joyernmei^t and to. turn the
isii-nas over to them when they have es
taDiisned their own-Government. He was
satistied that there was great danger 10
tne wmte labor of the United States'at
tendant upon the development of'indus
trial activity by this Government in the
Philippines and declared that the United
Stales could not compete with Japan for
the Oriental trade. China, also, was a
menace, in his opinion, to the supremacy
of the United States in the Oriental trade.
The large exportation of flour from the
United States to the Orient, he thought,
had misled people into believing that we
Could establish there a large trade. This
was an idle dream. He believed it would
be but a short, time until all the wheat
needed in China would be raised by
Chinese.
An earnest and forcible reply to Dubois
was made by Beveridge of Indiana, who
contended that the development of, Chin
ese resources would be of advantage in
trade and commerce in the United States,
as the industrial development \ of . other
nations had been. ; t ; ; } j -
WASHINGTON, May 23.- A temperate

rined himself almost entirely to a discus

trades men from interfering ylth the bus
iness of the planing mill owners has had
the effect of discouraging the calling out

ceived from Washington that the gunboat
Ranker be prepared for sea and await sailing
orders. .It Is likely the Ranger will go to
Panama to relieve the Philadelphia.
Upon the Philippine question is the only
! decided clash that has entered into the
I campaign. The Republican party in its
j platform has declared for the retention of
the islands. The Democrats are for their
eventual abandonment, or as character
ized by their opponents "scuttle." Port-
I land has large interests that favor the re
j tention of the islands. Its export trade.
I its lumber and flour industries, are look
ing to the Philippines as an outlet to a
profitable trade. The farmers of Oregon
are now profiting by the Asiatic demand
for wheat and flour. The Philippine ques
tion thus enters more largely into the
campaign than any other question, espe
cially since the Democratic platform
ignores the silver question and indorses
many planks of the Republican platform,
viz. :
Againrt leasing the public lands.
Favoring the irrigation by the Govern
ment of arid lands.
Protection of the State's fishing indus
tries.
Favoring the Chinese exclusion act.
Declaring for an open Columbia River.
Placing State officers on salaries.
Recommending a Department of Labor
and recognizing the rights of laborers to
form unions.
Declaring for the regulation of trusts
Favoring the adoption of the initiative
and referendum amendment.
Recommending a State Mining Bureau.
Favoring election of Senators by vote of
the people.
Since the Republican State Convention
put Its candidates into the field first It
can be readily seen that the Democrats
are playing second fiddle on a number of
important questions, and have practically
Indorsed the Republican views. Its plat
torcr. In addition, however, declares for a
tariff for revenue, against the Frye-Han
na ship subsidy bill, against the Northern
Securities Company merger, for the own
ership of public utilities, and favoring
amendments to the insterstate commerce
law.
PLANKS ON THE TARIFF.
On\the tariff question the two planks
follow: . /
Republican â We affirm our allegiance to the
principles ,of protection In necessary cases of
Industries still in their infancy or unable to
compete'with foreign productions.
Exanocratic â We arc In favor of a tariff for
revenue cnly. and are opposed to any protection
whatever of million-dollar and billion-dollar
trusts, combines and corporations, with which
the Republican party is in iniquitous alliance,
and wblebA partnership is calculated to over
throw republican institutions and subvert the
liberties of the people; and we favor placing
upon the frae list all trust-manufaptured ar
ticles of every kind.
On the Philippine question the parties'
views are as\ follows: ;

feelings and win the victory. The Re
publicans, with \V. J. Furnish of Pendle
ton as their standard-bearer, on the other
hand are bringing national issues into the
campaign. They seek an indorsement
of President Roosevelt and his national
administration and the upholding of
the national Republican policies, while at
the same time promising- an efficient, busi
ness-like administration of State affairs.
The Portland Mayoralty compalgn has
taken on an added Interest for the reason
that ex-Attorney General George H. Wil
liams is the regular Republican candidate
He consented against his wishes to make
the canvass, with the primary object of
healing the Republican dissensions caused
by the fight against Senator Simon In the
primaries. The venerable statesman ,1s
doing valiant work in the campaign and
Is taking a broad -stand that he is not
the candidate of either faction, but a Re
publican, interested in the success of the
whole Republican ticket. He has sprung
one of the strongest arguments of. the
campaign, that Oregon must go before
Congress as an applicant for gid for the
Lewis and Clark Centennial for 1905. and
that If the State goes Democratic it can-
IN MULTNOMAH COUNTY.
If Chamberlain wins, he has to over
come a normal Republican majority of
over 13,000 votes. To do this he counts
upon, first, his personal popularity hav
ing been elected Attorney General of- the
State in 1892 and District Attorney of
Multnomah County in 1900; second, upon
Republican disaffection in and
Multnomah counties. Governor Geer
whose home is in Marlon, was : turned
uown fcr the renomination for Governor
and the Chamberlain supporters believe
that the Geer Republicans in Marion will
.do some knifing at the polls. Governor
Oeer. however, has announced himself as
a candidate for the United States Senate,
and his interests will be furthered by con
tributing to Republican success in his
county. In Multnomah County, Chamber-
Iain has made a good record as District
Attorney, and the fact that there is a
fusion ticket in the field will cause him to
poll more than his regular party vote.
The Simon Republicans, having been de
feated at the primaries on the- issue of
the return of Senator Simon to the United
States Senate, have allied themselves
with the Democrats and put out a "Citi
zens" " ticket, with the offices equally' di
vided . between Simon Republicans and
Democrats. By this they hope to carry
the county not only for their local and
county offices, but also for Chamberlain
and the Democratic State ticket. Mult
nomah County, however,' gives a normal
Republican majority of. about 6000 votes,
and while the results of the local election
will be mixed, the regular party leaders
are confident that Mr. furnish will carry
the county by at least 2500 votes. This
majority will assure his election.' The
nomination of the Pendleton banker was
popular in Eastern Oregon, and the chair
man of the State. Central Committee,: W.
F. Matthews of Portland, 5 is confident
that the losses of Mr. Furnish In. Mult
nomah County and the Willamette Valley
will bo neutralized by his gains in the

SAN DIEGO, May 23.â A crusade
against signs on and in front of business
houses is causing consternation among
merchants here. An old. ordinance has
been unearthed which, if enforced, will
result. in the disappearance of business
signs from almost every store in the city.
Two Â¦ particularly embarrassing features
of the ordinance are those which prohibit
a sign from projecting more than a foot
beyond the face of the wall of any build

placed on any building higher than its

PORTLAND, May^23.â That Oregon
will sound the first trumpet to the
other States of the Union by in
dorsing the Republican policies in
June, there seems to , be no
doubt. A careful canvass of the counties
of the State gives the .victory to the Re
publican candidates by at least 10,000
votes, -while more confident estimates run
the majority up to 15,000. Nevertheless,
the party leaders are facing the hardest
kind of a fight and are not neglecting any
effort that will contribute to the success
at the polls. The Republican candidates
for Congress, Representative Thomas H.
Tongue, in vhe First District, and J. N.
Williamson, in the Second District, are
safe. Upon them the Democrats are wag
ing a weak and ineffective fight, while
concentrating their efforts upon the State
ticket, and particularly upon George E.
Chamberlain of Portland, their nominee
for Governor, whom they look upon as the
Moses that! will lead them out of the
desert into the fat and plenty of State
patronage. The campaign has this nov
elty: The Democrats are making no
ardent fight on national Issues. Their
leaders are simply whooping it up for
Chamberlain on the ground of his per
sonal popularity. By such tactics they

WHATCOM. Wash., May 23.â Alfred
Hamilton, alias .Alfred Hawkins, was
hanged this morning at 6 o'clock for the
murder of D. M. Woodbury at Anacortes
on September 7, 1S99. His neck was bro
ken by the fall and he was -pronounced
dead in sixteen minutes. "Hamilton main
tained his nerve to the last, saying in re
sponse to the Sheriff's question whether
he had anything to say: "No. I am here
tb die." He cursed the Sheriff when that
officer read the death warrant to him ten
minutes before the execution and rushed
up the scaffold stairs two steps at a time.
Alfred Hamilton murdered D. M. Wood
bury in Anacortes, Skagit County, on
September 7, 1899. Hamilton, who was a
fisherman, went Into Anacortes on the af
ternoon of September 6. After disposing
of his catch for more than $1000, he start
ed out to- "hold up" the town, after get
ting well under the influence of liquor.
During that night and next forenoon he
enforced his commands at the point of a
pistol. On the afternoon of September 7
the city marshal attempted to arrest him.
but Hamilton got the drop on the officer
and marched him to a neighboring build
ing. Woodbury followed and expostu
lated with Hamilton, who shot him.
One of the head men of the tribe sud
denly fell ill and claimed he had been be
witched by the boy. The other Indians
readily accepted this statement and the
youth was made a prisoner. He denied
the senseless charge, but in vain: The
medicine men led the lad to the hut where
the sick Indian lay and* held him over
yots of boiling wa^er, at the same time
betting him with clubs from which sharp
prongs projected. Under this torture the
victim fainted many time3, finally becom
injr unconscious.
The sick Indian did not seenrto recover,
and the boy, who had been revived, was
tied by the head and neck with ropes.
He was afterward placed In a hole dug
under the floor of the hut and kept with
out food and water for four days. Finally
he was missed and rumors of the outrage
reached the ears of a. party of whites.
They compelled the medicine men to re
lease the youth and' took him to Haines
Mission for treatment. It was the belief
when the Dirlgo sailed that he would die.
SEATTLE. May 23.â The steamer Dirigo,
which reached port this morning, brought
news of another strange case of Indian
superstition and cruelty In the native vil
lage of Klukwan strangely parallel to the
one recorded some months ago, when a
boy was buried alive because, as the
Â¦witch doctors said, he was "filled with
devils." In the late outrage the boy was
taken into. charge by the witch doctors,
oi 1 medicine_ men, who alleged that evil
spirits had taken possession of his body.
In order to rid him of the malignant in
fluence they tortured him by fiendish
methods and doubtless would have killed
the unfortunate lad had not several white
men rescued him at the point of a pistol.

"Whereas, The taxation of public bonds brings
but little revenue to the public treasuries, but,

saved by Palne's Celery Compound from
fatal kidney disease, writes as follow*:
"I had a terrible pain in my side Owing to
kidney troubles. I could hardly lie down;
but that trouble has all left me through
the use of Paine's Celery Compound. Last
spring I had mountain fever and was sick
a long time; since taking Paine's . Celery
Compound I am strong. I feel very grate-
ful for your medicine. I am glad to say
anything that would encourage people to
use it."
It addition to all this, Pairie's Celery
Compound will establish nerve. force, and
new nerve fiber; it will nourish the weak-
ened system and restore the full vital
functions of the kidneys. t -
If you value life, delay not the use of
Paine's Celery Compound a single hour.
Your present critical condition demands
the immediate use of this great life saver.
Palne's Celery Compound will accom-
plish â¢ more for you In your dis-
tress than you can imagine. Its first great
vital undertaking is the purification of the
life stream from waste matter, the result
of decomposition of the tissues. It will
remove all morbid materials, saving you
from uraemic poisoning, which so often
proves fatal in kidney disease.
You may perchance ask, "What will
Palne's .Celery Compound do for me, that
other medicines have failed to accom-
plish?" vi. \
If you are a victim of/ kidney disease,
take courage, dear sufferer. There is a
mighty saving agent that you have not
yet called to your aid; it is Faine's Celery
Compound. This grand medical prescrip-
tion has conquered as desperate cases as
yours; It has power to pluck, you as a
brand from the burning, if you have but
the faith' to give it a trial.
Thousands of people suffer through a
living: death from some form of kidney
disease. In the majority of cases the poor
sufferers have been informed by physi-
cians that there is no hope.

CHEERING WORDS
AT THE PARTING
NANAIMO, B. C, May 2.3.âImme
diately upon receipt of the news of the
Fernie mine disaster Mayor Manson of
this tow", which has a population of
about 1000 coal miners, authorized the
taking of subscriptions at the gates
leading to the grounds where a celebra
tion is being held. The amount will be
devoted to alleviating the suffering at
Fernie.
It is estimated that the company has
in its lands a coal deposit of 22,000,000,
000 tons.
Since that Jhe British Columbia
Southern Railway has been constrtct
ed as a feeder to the Great Northern.
Enormous coke ovens have been built
and Fernie itself, has sprung from a
hamlet to one of. the most promising
cities in Canada. The output of the
company's mines is . almost daily in
creasing, while the superior coking
qualities of the coal make it desirable,
for the finest steam purposes. Â¦ -,
For a time the company was threat
ened with extinction by the Central
Pacific Railway, but mainly through
Fernie's efforts, who hung on to his
holdings when others weakened, the
co-operation of Senator Cox. Robert
Jaffray, Silas Rogers, Colonel Pellatt
and other influential capitalists, includ
ing James J. Hill, was enlisted, and the
future of the company was assured.
FEBNIE BECOMES A CITY.
Â¦ The Crows Nest Coal Company, pro
prietors of the Fernie mines, is the out
grpwth of the enterprise of a syndicate
of Victorians. In 1886 William Fernie,
who resides here, learning that the Galt :
Company had applied for a charter
through the Crows Nest Pass, interest
ed a number of other gentlemen, who
put an exploring party in* the field with
Fernie at its head. One week after tak
ing the field, in 1887, the party found
the . first seam on Martin Creek.
Ledge after ledge were discovered
the year following.
the face "on the other side of Coal
Creek, is No. 3. No. 2 is worked (as
far as ventilation is concerned) in con
nection with No. 3, the same fan being
the motive power for ventilation in
both mines.

MINES F00RI/T EXCAVATED.
The mines are six miles from Fernie.
Three seams are being worked, and in
the initial stages of development, the
Government officials say, - the manage
ment took great risks, their workings
being irregular and made to hurry the
production, as the demand was in ad
vance of development. Nos. 2 and 3
mines are connected, and the Insoector
of Mines pointed out in his reports that
an explosion in the one would be apt
to affect the other. In the opinion of
the inspector a proper, use of the ven
tilating fan, which the; company has
kept constantly in use, an enlargement
of, the airways, keeping ; the brattice
close in to the face, putting in stopings
as 'required, and maintaining good dis
cipline, should result in a fair exemp
tion from danger.

These surmises probably contain an ele
ment of truth, but neither can in any way

Informed cuarters that the end of the
war has come. In fact, those persons
who are best acquainted with the actual
details of the present negotiations only
qualify this optimistic expression of opin
ion by guarded reservations concerning
the extent of the personal control of the
Beer leaders over their commands. Were
the Boers a thoroughly disciplined force,
dependent upon the action of their gen
eral officers, peace would probably be
proclaimed to-night; ..but Botha, Dewet
and the other generals seem themselves
unable to positively guarantee the degree
to which their example will be followed.
The delegates at Vereeniging, according
to information in possession of the War
Office are fairly evenly divided. Conse
quently extreme precautions are exerted
both in London and Pretoria to prevent
any premature action or report which
might adverselj' influence the burghers.
The most pessimistic forecast heard to
night only admits that a few isolated
bands of irreconcilables may be left in
the field.
CEKTAINTY OF PEACE.
Information as to what transpired ' at
tc-day's meeting of the Cabinet is closely
guarded, but It is not likely that the Cab
inet transactions were of vital import.
The eurmise of one well-informed person
places the sum total of the deliberations
of the Cabinet Ministers at a decision re
garding- points. of the peace agreement of
entirely minor importance. Another sur
mise Is that the Cabinet has merely sent
rather a meek ultimatum to South Africa,
Mhich can be used by the Boer leaders in
explanation to their forces.
Private and official advices received to
night in London from South Africa all
point to . the same conclusion. The delay
is technical, and to end the long war
seems to be the desire of both British
and Boer leaders. ThQ latter, however,
are unable to convince all their followers
of the vrlsdom of acquiescing to the terms
of peace. Â¦
LONDON, May 23.â There is every rea
son to believe that peace in South Africa
Is practically secured. How soon It, will
be announced depends, apparently, more
upon the convenience of the Boer leaders
than upon the Inclination of the British
Government.

One of those who declined to sign the

that If Â¦ Shearer, could be ; allowed to run

he could pot put back the machines which
had been suppressed several months ago

SACRAMENTO, May 23.â An aroused
public; sentiment forced the suppression
cf the nickel-in-the-slot gambling ma
chines several months ago. About two
weeks ago, Charles B. Shearer, who con
trols a large number of slot machines in
Oakland, came to Sacramento, and at
once rumors gained circulation that he
had made overtures to the local adminis
tration for the reinstatement of machines
which, he owned or controlled. Almost
simultaneously with Shearer's . advent
more than sixty slot machines were re

claimed by Shearer and stored in a Front

The. Bee this afternoon exposed the
scheme by which Shearer hopes, evidently
with the cognizance if not the consent of
Mayor Clark'sadministratlon, to start all
the machines running in the saloons â¢ of
Sacramento. For several days past he
has had an agent, Fred Myrick, call upon
the saloonkeepers to obtain their signa

Shearer, by which the latter contracts to
place the machines in the saloons, stand
all the expense of litigation and pay all

The Times believes that there is good
reason to hope the negotiations will re
sult in the surrender of the Boers, ". al
though it would be premature, says the
paper, to assume an immediate agreement
on all the chief points within sight. The
fact that the Free State delegates have
been committed to a discussion of the
terms, from which all question of inde

great advance, because the men who real

The first intimation of the disaster
which those on the outside received
was a rush of coal dust and fire to the
height of more than jooo feet above the
fan. Word was immediately sent to Fer
nie, five miles from the mine, and
within two minutes from the time of the
accident occurred relief parties were at'
wo^k.
R. . Drennan, Dr. Bonnell and
True Weatherly were the first to enter
the mine. When about 500 feet into the
working Drennan was overcome by
afterdamp and, had it not been for his
companions, would have perished. On
being removed to the outer air he re
covered and gave instructions " to the
rescuing party to commence repairing
the overcasts. The overcasts are the
pipes which connect the air through the
mine, and they had been almost com
pletely destroyed, rendering it im
possible to enter, owing to the after
damp.
HEBOISM OF THE RESCUERS.
Volunteers were called for and a score
of brave men sprang to the work. For
nearly six hours this policy was pur
sued with tireless energy. Every few
minutes the men would collapse and be
borne to the outer air 'and their place?
quickly filled by new; volunteers.
The first body recovered was taken
from No. 3 mine about ir o'clock and
was that of William Robertson, a lad
of 13 years. Several hours elapsed and
then three more bodies were recovered.
None of the victims gave the slightest
signs of life and their remains were re
moved to the washout. At 4 o'clock
this morning relief parties had pene
trated so far that the gas became un
bearable and operations had to be sus
pended for an hour or two in order to

FORT DE FRANCE, May 23.â It is now the unanimous opinion of the scientists that Mont Pelee is an explosive volcano, no real lava "or. moya rock mate
rial having been emitted, only mud, steam, gases and fragments of the old crater-beds. The scientists compare the mountain's out-throw to the steam of a
boiler in.which the pressure rises to bursting. point, and they think it possible that 3 more violent outbreak may occur. They remark that the ' explosions
have occurred at -progressively longer intervals, and that they also have been progressively more violent. . There have been three light eruptions of ashes. On
May 5'there was an overflow of mud, which caused the destruction of the Usine Guerin; on.May 8 there was the outburst which destroyed St. Pierre, and on
May 20, or after an interval of twelve days, the last, tremendous outbursts occurred. A new period of rest' is' now on, and one' of two things may happen: the
pressure may be confined for a still longer period and then explode with still greater violence, spreading destruction over a vast area, or the mountain may remain
quiescent for another half-century. \: t , . ... ' â¢ '."

STOCKTON MAIL (IND.):
The news from San Jose will bring sore
grief, to the heart of Governor Henry T. Gage
and the other manipulators of the Republican
machine. The Mont Pelee of public indigna
tion broke loose In the Garden City yesterday
and burled the local wire-pullers under .a
sizzling stream of In va .In. the shape of hoif
est . men's ballots and the desolation in the
camp -of the- bosses Is as complete as K Is
gratifying. to lovers of good government.
' Â¦ Special significance Is - given tp the result
because j Governor Gase had made Johnny
Mackenzie, the . leader of the overwhelmed
cohorts, his special pet by appointing him a
State Harbor Commissioner. This action could
have had. but one meaning, namely, that Gage
intended to stand for the kind of politics for
which Mackenzie was notorious. That ap
pointment, coming so soon before the election
in San Jose.; was undoubtedly Intended .to ex
ert the 'prestige of the State government In
favor of Mackenzie In his local tight.
But the people of San Jose - refused to en
dure longer the dictation of a b033.and.the
corruption Incident to his administration. Their
assertion of their own freedom was . also a
repudiation of the Governor's : Indorsement of
Mackenzie. The Mail hopes It Is an earnest
of a general repudiation of machine politics,
of which Governor Gage is the representative.
The result in &an Jose is a proof of the fact
that honest newspapers have not lost their
power ' with the people. To the persistent
efforts of the San Jose .Mercury and Herald
the result of yesterday's election was largely
due. Their camplgn' against Mackenzie's
regime was bitter and their columns presented
abundant ground for libel suits if the charges
they made were not true. - The verdict of the
people, however, indicates that San Jose be
lieved that the .charges ..of corruption were
well sustained. Â¦"â¢ â¢â â¢ , * ; v; ' '
However, all eood citizens wish the new
administration in San Josa abundant success.
To the defeated spoilsmen, to Governor G&ge
and. to all others who grieve over this mani
festation of the blighting fury of public wrath,
the Mail sends condolences .and this message:
Let the San Jose holocaust be a warning to
you. â¢ k'V'L- _ â¢
KAPA DAILY JOTJBNAL (DEM.):
At the municipal election in San Jose Mon
day.'the Gage-forces, otherwise known" as the
Mackenzie, machine, were completely routed- by
the Good Government forces. The reformers
elected George D. Worswlck Mayor and all the
other officers with the exception of Treasurer.
SACRAMENTO BEE (IND.):
If the Gage "business administration" should
be guilty of a few more blunders of the sort
exposed by The Call last week the State school
land fund would be bankrupt. By one act of
the Board of Examiners as represented by the
astute Daniel Kevane, that fund. lost the sum
of $16,63" 2Â»â lost it as absolutely a's though
It had been dropped- into the ocean, and lost
It simply because the '.'business administration"
of Gage did not have business sense enough to
know' that it was paying exactly $16,637 29
moVe '.for the bonds than ! they were worth.
The blunder was J thoroughly Inexcusable.
"So man of sound mind would think of paying
$106,247 29 for bonds which Were worth only
$S7,Â«0O, and yet this Is what. Gage's Board of
Examiners did. That It used the money which
goes to the support of the public schools of the
State to do It makes the act all the more
blameworthy. Â» â¢ â¢
Of course, no sane man with a knowledge
of the facts, would have thought of paying a
premium of $18,637 29 for bonds which in a
couple of months would be redeemed at their
faco value. But while every man. woman and
child in Kern County knew the facts, the Board
of Examiners, with Its shrewd Secretary Ke
vane and its expert accountants, made no ef
fort to ascertain them. The Supreme Court
decision, came, favoring thÂ» redemption; -thÂ«
bonds were redeemed at par; and the State
school fund lost . by the transaction : thÂ« sum
of, $1C,637 2Â©. representing the amount in ex
cess of their face value which bad been paid
for the bonds.
It is a noteworthy fact that Governor Gage,
though he is a member of the Board ol Ex
aminers, was not present when this impor
tant expenditure of public funds was made. It
might be said, almost, that he Is never present
at the 1 Capitol. 'Kevane is the man who wields
the executive power. Four years more of Gaga
will mean four years more of absenteeism;
four years more of Kevane. and four year*
more likelihood of such shameful waste of
public money as that Just described.
It is a remarkable circumstance that Gage,
after this loss had been sustained by the State'
vetoed a bill, "which had passed both houses
of the Legislature, framed for the purpose of
preventing Just such misuse of the nubllo
school funds of. tha State.
There may be no further need for American horses
or mules for war purposes in South Africa, but a
large number of those animals will be needed to re
stock the. farms when peace* returns, and it will be
just as well for the British to bear in mind that this
"is'the'.place to get them. "
The soldiers' and sailors' monument recently dedi
cated in Indianapolis is said to have cost $600,000
and is one of the finest monumental structures in
America. The cost, was much larger than was origin
ally proposed, but the ardor of the people grew with
the. progress of the work, and in the end they have a
municipal ornament they will be proud of for gener
ations to come. â¢ -

The absurdity of this charge and all charges

further, that "the worst that the city papers
can say against him [the Governor] Is that be

equal lack of sense and disregard of the facts.
The noisy and censorious. Gage newspapers
are hard pushed to- make capital for him. and to
crowd his critics over the tjank and silence

IX)S ANGELES TIMES:
VISALIA DELTA:
I have been asked to state the reasons why
I am unalterably opposed to the renomination
and re-election of Henry T. Gage. I herrwlth
briefly recount my reasons. I am opposed to
Gage because In his campaign of four years
ago he made a speech in this city In which
he said, with a. vibratory voice and other
manifestations of emotion, that had he known
at the outset his name was to have been
linked with the names of party bosses -and
boodle wlelders he would never have gone
before the people as a candidate. ' At the mo
ment that Gage spoke these words he tx&d
pledged himself to do the bidding of Dan
Burns. I cannot countenance such insincerity
nor overlook such political hypocrisy. I am
against Gage because of his pernicioua pclicy
of placing the charitable institutions at the
State In the care of men of questionable char
acter because those men are his (Gage's)
supporters. I am opposed to Gage be
cause he signed tha infamous signature
Mil and thus flung an Insult In the
face of every newspaper man in the State
and made California the laughing stock
of the nation. I am opposed to Gage
because he vetoed the water 'and forest appro
priation bill and thus wrought a great iiriury
to the agricultural and horticultural. Interests.
I am opposed to Gage because he commuted
the sentence of Frank R. Donlan, a murderer.
regarding whose guilt there wasn't tha least
suspicion of a doubt. To keep such a man
as Gage in the gubernatorial chair ia to de
flower the fame of the glorious State of Catr
fornia. .--.A;' i Â¦'.Â¦ Â¦ ." ' . .
The issue is one of far-reaching importance, for if
the Federal Government can intervene to protect
citizens of States from lynch law and thus set aside
State courts and State constabulary it could inter
vene in other ways. Great as is the problem of
lynching, the proposed remedy raises a problem
greater still. It might be worth while to give the
proposed law a trial. It would at least scare' the
lynchers a little, and â¢ that would be something
gained. Â»
While the argument is ingenious, it is not looked
upon as conclusive even by Mr. Pillsbury 1 himself.
His plea is mainly for a test- of the law. He says:
"In view of express constitutional provisions, and in
the present state of judicial decision, the existence
or non-existence of this power in the Federal Gov
crr.ment can be determined only, by submitting a
statute to the test of judicial examination."
Furthermore, he argues that the fourteenth
amendment changed the old status of citizenship,
and all citizens of States are now primarily citizens of
the United States and are entitled to look to it for
protection. The amendment expressly authorizes
Congress to enforce its provisions by appropriate
legislation.
Mr. Pillsbury argues that, the 'fourteenth amend
ment forbids the States to deny any person within
their jurisdiction "equal protection of the laws," and
he holds that the prohibition may be violated as
truly by omitting to give adequate protection as by
passing acts to deny such protection. Thus he says:
"It would seem that when a citizen or other person
is put to death by a lawless mob, in default of the
protection which the State is bound to provide for
ail alike, there is a denial of equal protection by the
State, in the sense of the equality clause, which Con
gress may prevent or punish by legislation applying
to any individuals who participate in or contribute
co it directly or indirectly."
Albert E. Pillsbury of Massachusetts has under
taken to give vitality to the bill by presenting reasons
why it may be deemed constitutional, and his argu
ment, published in the current number of the Har
vard Law Review, has attracted a good deal of at
tention. It may have the effect of rousing public
sentiment in favor of the bill and thus inducing Con
gress to enact it and give it a fair trial before the
cov.rts.
It is probable that a majority of the members of
Congress regard the measure as' unconstitutional,
for otherwise much more prominence would haf^
been given it. The issue with which it deals is one
of the most serious problems tliat " confront the
American people, and, since the State courts seems
to be powerless to check it, an appeal to Federal ac
tion would undoubtedly have a strong support were
it not for a belief that the evil lies beyond the reach
of Federal jurisdiction. Â¦ v
AMONG the bills now . before Gongress of
which little has been/heard is one providing
that the . killing of a citizen of the United
States by a mob in default of protection by State,of
ficers shall be deemed a violation of the peace of the
United States, and every person. participating in such
mob shall be deemed guilty of. murder and subject
to prosecution therefor in the Federal courts.
LAW AND THE L^NCHERS.
The Gage newspapers are never weary of
shouting that the tax levy this year ia the
lowest in the history of the State. This may
be soâ some deny itâ but the farmers of th*"
State who are vitally interested In irrigation "
matters have not forgotten that Governor Gage
vetoed the irrigation bill which was prepared
with much care by the California Water and
Forest Association, and which was passed by
both houses of the Legislature with only one
dissenting vote. The 7000 members of the as
sociation, who are all voters, have not forgot
ten Governor Gage's action. If he is nomin
ated they will clearly remember him at 'the
polls. Â¦ ...... - â¢"Â¦ -
EEBLANDS CITBOGEAPH:
Colonel D. M. Burns, In a recent interview,
while confessing an estrangement between him
self and Crimmlns, on account of a quarrel over
the spoils, insisted that he was still as close
as ever to Herrln. These little personal facts
are regarded as news worth paying telegraph
tolls on. Why? Who Is W. F. Herrln? He
is a pleasant and Intelligent gentleman, who
is hired by the Southern Pacific to do politics
for the railroad. In his personal capacity he
is nothing, represents nothing, aspires to noth
ing. He is the living embodiment of the South
ern Pacific in politics, and makes no pretense,
and asks no pretense, that he stands for. any
thing else. Now the Southern Pacific Is a
most useful railroad corporation, which ha3
rendered vast business service to California at
much incidental profit to Itself. As such it is
entitled to receive, and does receive, all due
business and public consideration. But the
Southern Pacific is not a citizen of California,
and has no business in the politics of Cali
fornia. A citizen may engage in politics for
good or for evil, but the intrusion of a cor
poration into politics, for any purpose what
ever. Is an unmixed public evil, and quite the
most pronounced political â¢ evil of our day.
What shall we think then of the political leader
who frankly avows partnership with this politi
cal influence? What shall we think of any
candidate for office who attaches himself 'to
that leader's fortunes and suffers his control?
Just what we think cf the power behind the
throne that they all indirectly 1 represent. The
issue is drawn, fortunately, * with entire dis
tinctness In California. There is.no compro
mising it or' mlstakinc it. The 'trail of the

ARCATA UNION:
Just what Governor Gage has done to entitle
him to eulogies from the Democratic party we
do not know, but some Democratic papers are
advocating his nomination. This is supposed
to mean that in the Judgment of these papers
Gage will be an easy Republican to beat.
KAPA DAILY REGISTER:
Neither the Pasadena News nor Us editor,
personally, are supporting Governor Gage's
candidacy for renomination. "We think it
would be far better for" 'the. Republican party
and for the State if Governor Gage would not
force his candidacy. . Further than not sup
porting Governor Gage's ambition we have no
candidate, although we are friendly to all the
aspirants personally.
iMvill be seen that the string attached to Russia's
.proposition is tangled and knotty. A long time will
be required to straighten it out. We may conclude,
therefore, that the powers will remain in the position
they now hold and Russia will remain in Manchuria.
By degrees the spirit of- aggression will carry each
side farther and farther into Chinese territory. By
and by they will come into contact with one another
and then the world will probably hear of an ultima
tum. That, however, is a long way off. China might
as well make up her mind to look upon Manchuria
r as a Russian province and Tientsin as a permanent
station of friendly protectors against possible Rus
sian encroachments. .
r The insistence upon these" new terms" niay* be' high
diplomacy, but it seems very much like what com
mon folks call ."passing the buck." Russia says to the
powers, "I will get cut of Manchuria when you get
out of Tientsin." The powers say to China, "We will
get out of Tientsin when you agree not to come in."
If now China would say, "I will agree. to the new
proposals when Russia evacuates Mancl/uria," the
circle would be complete. !,.
While debating the question and arranging a joint
reply to Russia, the allies have announced that they
will leave Tientsin provided China will agree to cer
tain new proposals. According to the summary made
public the chief of the new propositions are:' "N.o
Chinese Goldierj, to.be permitted in the city, while
foreign soldiers are to garrison the Tientsin foreign
settlement. The Chinese police in the native city
not to exceed 2500. No Chinese garrison within
some twenty miles of the city can be augmented, nor
can Chinese troops pass within twenty miles of it;
although foreign troops can travel about freely with
in that radius. Foreign troops to occupy the sum
mer resorts at Pcitaiho and in the hills west of
Peking. Only* one Chinese war vessel to be at Taku
a}, a time." '-> :Â¦ â¢:; - Â¦ Â¦. Â¦ -.Â¦ Â¦.
When peace was made with China it was agreed
that the powers should restore Peking to the Chinese
Government and evacuate the country, while upon
her" part China agreed to dismantle the forts be
tween Peking and the sea and to place the powers
in control of certain points so that in case of emer
gency they could readily reach the capital. The pow
ers, however, have not evacuated the country. They
are still at Tientsin, and now they have to make a
showing in reply to the, announcement of the Czar
concerning his policy in .Manchuria. *
The latest revised reports upon the subject are that
Russia announces she will withdraw her troops- from
Manchuria when the other powers withdraw Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦ their
troops from Tientsin. It is now a case* of,, seeing
which side can best extricate itself from an awkward
situation. The powers that have been 'â¢ so violently
protesting against Russian aggression have to" make
the next move or give a good reason for not doing
so. Naturally there is trouble in diplomatic; circles
and a good deal of hard thinking and harder ..lan

IT appears that the praise given to Russia- for-her

NATA DAILY- REGISTER:
OAKLAND ENQUIRER:
As for the relation of the San Jose contest
to State politics, it can only be said that it
constitutes a very unfavorable omen for Gov
ernor Gage. The Governor took up Mackenzie
several months since, recognized him as the
leader In Santa Clara County, and honored
him â¢ by making . him State Harbor Commis
sioner. The Mackenzie men declared that as
soon as the city election was' out of the way
they would begin the county . fight for Gover
nor Gage, but from present appearances they
will not be able to win it A. Mackenzie's great
est strength was in San Jose city, and in the
Country districts he ' has been rather weak.
Before the city election it was generally con
ceded that if the reformers should win there
Mackenzie could not hope to carry the county,
while, on the other hand, the reformers might
lose the city and still carry the county.
THE influential Republican newspapers of the State and the leading non-partisan journals hold that one terra
of Gage is all that the people can endure. The overwhelming defeat of the bosses in the San Jose election
is'gerierally acceptedas a rebuke of Gage's candidacy for another term. The Gage following consists
mainly of State' office-holders, deputies and others on the public payroll. The crushing defeat administered
; to -Mackenzie has demoralized the office-holding gang, and many of the push politicians who were ardent
supporters of the administration a month ago concede that Gage is practically out of *he race. Santa Clara County
has been taken from the boss column and placed in line with the forces of honest administration. All signs point to
an overthrow of the bosses in Sacramento County. The scandals in Humboldt County have aroused the anti-boss Re
publicans of that region to a sense of their duty. The following press comment is interesting:
SAN DIEGO UNION:
Ordinarily a municipal election in San Jose
would have little Interest for. the rest of the
State. - The contest in that city- yesterday,
however, ia one in which the entire Bepublican
paTty. of California was directly concerned.
The battle was between the so-called "push,"
headed by Gage's henchman Mackenzie on the
one. side and - the opponents of machine poli
tics on the other... The fight appears to have
been as hot as any ever fought in a Cali
fornia city, election.
'The outcome is a distinct setback for ma
chine politics of the Gage . stripe. According
to. the returns,, the ticket headed by Mackenzie
and the "push" | was overwhelmingly beaten.
California Republicans will ' accept the re
sult as a pood augury for the greater cam
paign that is to be made against the greater
"push"â the Republican machine which is
seeking to force the renomlnation of Henry T.
Gage for Governor upon men who will not vote
for him | again for any office whatever.
nor Gage haa not had the opportunity to ap
point a United States Senator since b.e was
elected, and has appointed none; and yet as
sertions of this kind are deliberately put forth
with the expectation of deceiving somebody
and arousing a prejudice to break the force of
Just criticisms, hoplngr by such silly processes
to make capital for his Kxcelleney.

and haa no knowledge of what either of them
has done, or attempted to do, with thÂ« Gov
ernor lp the matter of influencing ur controlling
hie administration, or any act o :t; but we
venture the surmise that the :::en of . the
Chronicle and The Call are 'not Justly charge
able. In the slightest degree, with any effort
to "steer" the Governor in any matter what
ever. We do not believe they have so stulti
fied themselves as men, cr that they would
thus compromise themselves as Â¦ journalists.
As for the Times, the charge is too absurd
to entitle it tq. any attention whatever. No
sane man in the State believes, or can eay,
that the editor of this journal or any man con
nected with it has ever asked of Governor GagÂ»
any favor whatever, great or small, cr sought
to influence the course of his administration
by solicitation., importunity, menace or ether
means. The Governor himself will not have
the hardihood to so assert. The Times is oy
posln? hta administration for proper, legiti
mate, grave, sufficient and impersonal reason?,
whid/have heretofore been plainly stated. Ke
J3 merely a public servant, not above the peo
ple who elected him, not above criticism, but
amenable to popular censure and public chal
lenge as to his fitness for renomlnation.. This
Journal Is nobody's, servant, and Mr. Gage will
yet learn the truth that Governors are for a
day and not for all time â not even for two
terms, when the people choose to say nay.

- -It is to be borne in mind that the 157 deputyships
appointed for counties and municipalities do*" not
comprise all the appointments at the disposal of the
proposed commission. It can establish an office and
appoint clerks and employes wherever it deems
them necessary.- It would be easy, therefore, for
the commission to provide every member of the
Legislature with some kind of a permanent job to
dispose of as he deems best. In short, the scheme of
Gage and his allies proposes to develop the most pro
lific political plum tree known to history. At every
shake of the tree there will fall plums enough to fat
ten many a boodler, and it will not be long before
the legislators find it put and act accordingly.
Suppose the Legislature should fix salaries at that
figUTC and. the Governor of the State who is to sur
ceed Gage .should .-veto the salary bill, what then?
The' Legislature would adjourn without fixing sala
ries,, and/ under the amendment the commission
would then have the right to fix them. The State
would gain nothing by the veto. The boodlers would
be playing a sure game.
Consider the' figures a moment. There are in the
State 57 counties and upward of 100 cities and towns.
This will give the commission the appointment of
157 deputies to start with. As there are forty Seni
tors, twenty-one constitutes a majority, and as there
are eighty Â¦Assemblymen, forty-one constitutes a
majority of that' branch of the Legislature. The ma
jorities of the two houses make a total of Hxty-two.
Suppose the 157 deputyships were distributed among
the Sixty-two, members of the Legislature, would
there not be,. a good big inducement for a majority in
each house to vote for a liberal salary â say $2400 per
annum? * / ; . : -
The facts are these: Governor Gage will have the
appointment of the commission; three members of
4he commission will control its action; Gage can ap
point one of those members for six years, another
for eight years and the third for ten years, so that his
three will; dominate the commission for -full six
years, and during that time have an unlimited power
of appointments all over California.
What will be the effect of those provisions if the
amendment be adopted? The commission,, being
made the successor of Boards of Supervisors and city
and town councils or other governing bodies {of
counties and municipalities so far as the regulation of
corporations is concerned, will of course easily find
an excuse for establishing an office with an. ample
array of clerks and deputies in every county and
every city and town in the State. It will also have
need for other clerks and employes to look after the
work which the commission takes- over from the
present Railroad, Bank and Insurance commissions.
With such a large number of appointments at its
disposal, the commission can readily arrange to die
tribute patronage among members of the Legislature
and thus get liberal salaries allowed. It will be seen
that the means for controlling the corrupt elements
of the Legislature will be immense and will be ready
at hand in every county and every municipality.
The amendment provides: "The commission shall
have a general office in such place as it may deter
mine from time to time, and shall appoint such clerks
and employes as it may from time to time deem
necessary, and shall be allowed all necessary costs of
travel in performance of duties, and all expenses and
salaries shall be paid by the State." It is further
provided: "But the Legislature may from time to
time in its discretion regulate the salaries of all
clerks and employes, but, failing so to do, the com
mission shall have the power to fix the same."
A FEW days ago The Call directed the atten
tion of the public to the extraordinary ap
. pointing , power conferred by Assembly con
stitutional amendment No. 28 upon the commission
which it. purposes to create. The subject is an im
portant one to taxpayers and is worth considering in
detail, so that" a fair estimate may be made of the ex
tent of boodle contained in the scheme.

Manila a clean and healthful city. We have estab

roused the desire of Filipinos to learn the English
language. On the other hand the antagonisms
among the people and their inability to work ren
der it doubtful if we shall ever make them, in this
generation, a peaceful and prosperous community.
It happens, however, that between the Chinese and
the Filipino there is. a, bitter racial antagonism, and
the writer notes. that the children of the two races
go to different schools and " frequently fight when
they meet on the streets.

Crowds of people flocked to the ferry
building yesterday to enjoy the exhibi
tion so admirably planned by the Cali
fornia State Floral Society. The second
day had not in the least diminished the
freshness and the rich hues of the flow
ers.
There were several additions to , the
richly loaded tables yesterday, and among
the most important were exquisite speci
mens of the old English sweet brier. .
The appearance of the single rose is
evidence here, as it has been in England
of late, that the taste for roses is going
back from doubles to singles. For one
hundred years of more the cultivation
has been toward producing the present
large varieties of double roses from the'
wild rose. The tendency is now to go back
to the delicate wild rose. Peter "i'hiesen .
and Frank Pelicano have a beautiful. If
small, display of the sweet brier rose,
fcnd Professor E. J. Wickson exhibits a
cluster of single roses that delights all
cultivators.
Mrs. John Ross Martin, Mrs. W. S.
Chandler, Mrs. Hodgkins and many other
of the ladies who have given months of
thought and time to bring about the suc
cess of the exhibition were entertainers
of many parties of friends and visiting
strangers during the .afternoon.
The exhibition was augmented In the
-evening when Mrs. Martin and her col
leagues received from Marin County an
additional lot of wild flowers.
Frank Pellicano & Co. added to their
collection some cut flowers of such beauty
as to win for them the J25 prize, and,
much to the surprise and delight of the
committee and the visitors, a huge truck
ful of wild azaleas was received from
Humboldt County, and also a great leafed
water plant of immense circumference.
The exhibit won for the county the so
ciety s silver medal.
Among the visitors during: the day were
oÂ» d . ladies from institutions, orphans and
nigh school botany classes, for whom free
admission had been arranged. The ferry
building was ablaze with electric lights
and gay with the varied and bright col
ors of the floral display.
To the music of the /United States Traln
in & Station orchestra the people prome
naded between bowers of flowers of the
garden and meadow. Fashion was out in
numbers, and the second day's exhibit
proved a great success for the Floral So-,

An article entitled "California's Volcanic
Relics" in to-day's San Francisco News Letter
is a thorough and intelligent discussion of the
lava beds of this $tate. The disaster at Mar
tinique ' has also' led to the correction of the
story in some. of the dailies that the last ,bt
â¢tho Carlbs were , killed by the Soufrlere vol
cano. . The true , history of the Caribs and
their extinction is given. ' In direct contrast to
this ; Is "Count Castellane tothe Rescue," a
burlesque on yellow journal methods. .-. There
is a good story this week by W. O. McGeehan.
It is entitled "A Bout With Famine." and deals
with life on a Belvedere houseboat. "But One
Interpreter" is a little tragedy, and "The Poet
ograph," a very funny description of a new
invention.'-, is-a good antidote for it. The- old
newspaperman's reminiscences tell of / the
election of one war. Governor, and "Campaign
Echoes" makes tho political situation clear.
Besides other : personal , gossip the. Looker' On
department has a good story of Governor Odell
and President Harriman. The financial, dra

thereon a plate with the following in

The coming reception on June 3, Jeffer
son Davis* birthday, at the "Bella Vista "
closes a number of charming socials late
ly held by the Jefferson Davis Chapter
United Daughters of the Confederacy,
prior to their summer vacation. The
chapter was organized January 19, 190''
Robert E. Lee's birthday, at the residence
of Judge Thornton, and it was then re
solved that on the second Wednesday of
each month following a similar reunion
would occur. One of the most pleasing of
these events occurred at the residence of
Mrs. Joseph Le Conte, Bancroft way
Berkeley, and several numbers not down
on the programme made the surprise all
the more enjoyable. Two ex-Confederate
members of the artillery company known
throughout the war as the Richmond
Howitzers cheered the ladles with their
encouraging wojrds and sanction of their
fealty. The chapter has taken up with
zeal the memorial and charitable work
which the Daughters of the Confederacy
are organized to fulfill, which has so lonir
lain dormant.-

afternoon at her Â¦ residence, Washington

hundred ladies were received and the tea
was a delightful affair. Those who assisted
Mrs. Merrill in receiving were: Mesdames

perfect in every detail. Purple iris pre
dominated for decoration at one table!
Another' table was in yellow, principally

Entertainments were given last night by
Kildare, Antrim, Donegal, Sligo and
Cavan; Excellent programmes were ren
dered and the visitors were heartily wel
comed at the booths. At Donegal Mrs.
Robert Allen, wife of the leader of the
Iroquois. band, which has furnished the
music for the fair, . sang '.'Three-Leaved
Shamrock" and "Because' I Love You"
in very clever style. Miss Lottie Arm
strong sang a soprano solo, Mrs. Jennie
Robertson did a clever Irish character
sketch and Miss Mabel Phiefer and Miss
Edith Norton did some fancy dancing.
Part of Cavan booth's entertainment
consisted of a four-handed reel by Messrs.
O'Connor and Kelleher and Miss Bessie
Allen and Miss Pearl Hickman, Little
Lillie Quinn danced an Irish jig in a man
ner that won applause for Donegal booth.
The band concert to-night will.be com
menced by the playing of Mayor Schmitz's
march, the. "Yankee. Hustler."
Preparations will be made to-day for
entertaining the crowd to-night. This
morning the large platform in the middle
of the Pavilion which has been" used by
the dancers will be torn down. The. re
moval of this stand, besides furnishing
more room, will greatly aid the crowd
in moving about. There . will be no free
list to-night, and those who have enjoyed
free entrance to the * fair hitherto will
have to pay to witness the close.
At one time last night it was estimated
thai there were between 6000 and 7000 peo
ple in the Pavilion. During the evening
iully 10,000 people visited the fair. The
Young Ladies' Institute and -the Young
Men's Institute were specially invited,
and large delegations from both organi
zations were in attendance. Company L,
LÂ»ea.gue of the Cross Cadets, which is
under the command' of Captain Frank H.
Moore, was awarded the medal last night
which it won by its clever drilling earlier
in the fair. Before the presentation took
place the company executed a number of
maneuvers in the lower part of the hall.
The' visitors will be afforded an oppor
tunity of enjoying the receptions at the
various booths. Because of the numerous
other attractions, the booths generally
have not been accorded the attention that
they deserve. All the booths are beau
tifully decorated, but unless one enters
them their chief attractions cannot be
seen. .
The Irish Fair, which has kept Mechanics'
Pavilion crowded nightly and which has
proved to be^ the most elaborate, enjoy
able, picturesque and successful festival
ever attempted in this - city, will be
brought to a close to-night. No special
programme has been arranged Â¦, for the
evening, but each booth will keep open
house and hold a reception and entertain
ment. New features will be added to all
the attractions and the band has : pre
pared "a concert of special excellence. -It
is expected that the crowd to-night* to see
the curtain . rung down on the splendid
exhibition will tax Mechanics' Pavilion
to its greatest capacity.

A. R, Lewis, M. D., in a lengthy article
in the columns of the American Journal
of Health says concerning hair: "Its
deterioration is a constant source of wor-
riment to humanity, consequently bald
people are readily deceived by 'fake' hair
restoratives. The wish that a hair prepa-
ration will 'fill the bill' is father to the
fancy that it is likely to do so. A rare
case in point is that of Newbro's Herpi-
cide, which actually does 'fill the bill.' It
destroys the parasite that attacks the
hair root, and prevents dandruff, falling
hair and baldness." Â¦ . r~^-':

WOMAN'S POWER

Mind Render Women All-Power-
_ ful. Health, However, the Great-
est Charm.
'Â¦:â¢" "Woman's greatest gift 'is thepo-werto inspire admiration, respect, v
and*- love.'. There is a beauty in health which is more attractive to men
than mere regularity of features. .
The snap and spirit which health gives to the eye, the movement,;
and the speech are full of magnetism.
Sickly women can't understand this.
- They only know that they are miserable, and their efforts to be
attractive are languid and weak.
Woman's influence in the world is limited by her strength, and the
strength of health is real strengths -f^.
It brings with v it beauty and grace and loveliness of disposition.
To be a successful wife, to retain the love and admiration of her
husband, should be a woman's constant study. If she would be all she
may, she must guard well against the signs of ill health. y, ; '.,
p^:. Regular and painless menstruation is absolutely necessary.
The help which Ijytlia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound gives
to women who are attacked by any disorder of the feminine organism ia.^ .
real, permanent help. It cures all weaknesses of the organs and makes
it possible for women to retain their health and beauty to maturity. .
Mrs. Piakliam advises women "who are ill free of cost. Address
. her at Lynn, Mass. Thousands owe their health to her.

'. A Boston Woman's Experience.
"Deab Mrs. Pinkham: â I feel very grateful to you for the benefit I
derived from your kind advice and remedies. I was troubled -with a compli-
cation of female troubles, had ovaritis, painful and irregular menstruation,
leucorrhoea, nervousness and weakness. I had no appetite and could not â¢
sleep nights. The leftst exertion would cause shortness of breath and, dull
pains in my hips and side. The doctors all advised me to have an operation
and have one of ray ovaries .removed, but this I could not bear to think of. I
Â¦was induced to try X.ydia, E.' Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, and
after taking the first bottle I was much improved. It renewed my appetite,
health and strength. I continued taking it, also your Blood Purifier and
Sanative Wash until entirely cured of all my troubles- The pains have never
returned and my health is splendid. Your remedies have been a boon to me
and 'I am sure many a woman owes her life to them." â Mabib Webb, 356
Columbus Ave., Boston, Mass. (March 15, 1901.)
No other medicine in the world has received such widespread
and unqualified endorsement. "
No other medicine has such a record of cures j of female
troubles or such hosts of grateful friends. Remember this "when
you go to buy: Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.

A report from the Machinists* Union was
received to the effect that the Federal
Government contemplated the immediate
construction of three warships and that
one of them would be built at Mare Isl
and.
The Milk Drivers* Union reoorted that
the Boston Ranch and Pacific Dairy, op
erated by George L. Purham, was unfair.
The matter was referred to the executive
committee.
Secretary Rosenberg was granted two
weeks' leave at absence with full pay.
Florence Kelly addressed the council
upon the subject of the National Con
sumers' League, of which she is secre
tary, her object being to impress upon
all women the need of urging that cloth-
Ing bought by them should bear the
stamp of the league to indicate that the
same was made under proper hygienic
conditions.
The brotherhood men say they will hold
out against the policy of P. H. McCarthy
to the last unless he agrees that local
unions have a legal right to affiliate with
their national organizations. They claim
the right to earn a living at their trade,
even tnough they do not work with the
building trades card in their pocket. Tha
Building Trades Council declines to let
any men of its affiliated unions work with,
any mechanic who has not its working
card, and this is the main cause of the
trouble.
The various unions of the building*
trades are greatly dissatisfied with tho
existing state of affairs and the con
tractors believe that with their co-oper
ation the trouble will sbon be settled.
The San Francisco Labor Council adopt
ed the following resolution anent the
Philippines, reported by ,the executive
committee: . ";I -
Whereas, Information about the Philip
pine Islands given to the American people in
reluctant driblets shows a condition tco bad
to be permitted even In, the Philippines; and
whereas, It appears there is at present neither
power nor Inclination, to stop these islands
from being used as a bridge over which Chi
nese may come into the United States main
land; therefore, be it ___,.
Resolved, That the San Francisco Labor
Council, in regular session assembled. May 23,
1902, is opposed to any legislation about tha
Philippines being enacted until the public may
know the real conditions in those Islands, and
the real status of their Inhabitants under our
flar. ;
The gravity of the situation is recog
nized by all the men connected with the
building industry. Owing to the disagree
ment the construction of many large
buildings is held in abeyance at a great
loss to laboring men. mechanics and con
tractors. Prospective builders, recogniz
ing that their structures may be held up
at any time, decline to take risks until
peace between the rival factions ha3 been
declared. The contractors are hopeful
that with their co-operation the trouble
will be satisfactorily adjusted.
A committee of the Builders' Protec
tive Association will meet with the new
district council of the Brotherhood of Car
penters to-night with a view to arranging
some plan by which the troubles between
the brotherhood unions and the Building
Trades Council may be adjusted.

Through the mediation of mutual
friends the couple were reconciled recent
ly and Mrs. Peake returned home It lq
alleged that she persuaded Peake to draw
what money he had from the Union Iron
Works, where he was employed, and that
one day while he was at work she left
unexpectedly with the money, two chil
dren, the family, provisions and about- all
ot his personal belongings. He thoue-ht
that he had located her in the house"! a
Mrs. Bernard at 2868 Twenty-second
street, but when . he went to search for
her a crowd of men assailed and shame

Secretary White of the Society for the

dition as a result of the flight of his do

treatment he received from. an unknown
number of men who beset him just as he
was about to capture the former part

"It is a fact." said Curtis, "that the
food furnished at the City and County
Hospital is of poor quality, and. the insti
tution should be allowed an increased ap
propriation."
D'Ancona thought the hospital should
have $120,000 yearly, and his .colleagues
agreed with him.
"There is only one other way of raising
the money." said Payot. "and that is to
raise the liquor license. I am in favor of
raising the license away up." *
"I do not agree with you on that score,"
said Supervisor Alpers.
Curtis held that if the licenses were
raised the Police Department would want
the money.
"The only Supervisor who is against the
extra levy is Sanderson," said Payot, "but
I think he is amenable to reason."
Alpers Eaid that he would do a little
missionary work with Sanderson.'
The Supervisors' Health and Hospital
Committee held an informal discussion
yesterday over Curtis' proposed ordinance
to levy a special tax of 7^4 cents to build
a new ' City and County Hospital. The
Judiciary Committee was to have met in
joint session on the question, but none of
its members were present.
Supervisors Payot and Alpers expressed
themselves in favor of the special levy not
only for, a hospital, but for new schools.

each for hospital and schools be levied,

raise sufficient funds. ' .VV' ;

week's illness. He was a kindly man,
beloved by all who knew him, and his
untimely taking off has thrown a mantle
of gloom over the newspaper offices of
San Francisco. Mr. Dressier was gener

of others and faithful to every trust Im

Deceased enjoyed the confidence and'
friendship of men in every walk of life.
By his kindly ways and honorable actions

sufferings calmly and bravely. He re
lieved the sufferings of others. With
generosity he brightened many a home
and made it brighter by contributing the
necessaries of life.
Mr. Dressler's career, as a newspaper
man was an interesting one. His first
i experience on a paper was when he en

FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS.
On Friday last he was attacked with
stomach trouble and was compelled to
seek his apartments at 914 Geary street.
Dr. Rosencranz, his regular physician,
was called in and at once perceived hi.?
patient was in a precarious condition.
He immediately called Doctors Gallwey
and O'Brien into consultation. They ad
vised Mr. Dressler's removal to the Lane
Hospital. His condition grew worse and
it was found necessary to perform an op
eration, which was done on Thursday
afternoon by Dr. Vowinckle, assisted by
Drs. Rosencranz, O'Brien and Caldron.
The patient gradually grew weaker and
weaker, however, until death ended his
sufferings.
Some eight or ten years ago Mr. Dress
ier was in danger of succumbing to con
sumption. He was prevailed upon to take
a vacation and after a few months in
Arizona he gained health and strength
and was able to come back and renew his
duties. Â¦ 'Â«.

saw. great orchards of prunes, peaches,
apricuis and pears, not measured in acre

nacis. They saw prune groves with the
trees bending to tne point of breaking
uiitier their too plentiful load of half
tjrown fruit, and other trees with the
uuit scientifically thinned until the
trouno beneath was covered by the green
pellets and but one-fourth remained on
i he trees. They saw a dozen irrigating:
Unches from the Kaweah brimming full,
but carrying their wealth-creating water.s
cii to tne dry land beyond, for the or
chards of Visalia are on moist land and
nt-ed no irrigation. There were meadows
cf luxuriant alfalfa and pastures wit.li
hundreds of sleek cattle grazing; and
mere were still left tor the strangers to'
admire groves of the magniticenc oaks
that once covered the valley.
in Visalia proper the* guests were
shown the industries that go to make up
a live town, and streets and schools and
nomes of which the residents are justiy
proud.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
L. M. King of the Merchants* Associa
tion asked that $125,000 be set aside for ac
cepted streets and the removal of cobble
stones, also that the county roads be
made passable. He advised the putting of
all'overhead wires underground. The as
sociation, he said, favored such an in
crease in the police force as would give
protection to all sections of the city
n E ; Â£ ,F al ? y> the Golden

asked that Dorland street be graded. Ed

tral Improvement Association, urged that
accepted streets be repaved U1|seu lnal
The board adopted a resolution recom
mending that the Auditor, allow former
Deputy Justices' Clerks B. P. Byers, jh
Roxburgh and G. F. Aubertlne two-th'irds
of their salary claims, amounting to re

J. F. Cowdery protested against the pe
tition of the Board of Works to be al
lowed $12,000 for private lot surveys.
Captain A. H. Payson of the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company
agreed to pay half the cost of a bridge
across Channel street at the foot of Third.
He asked that the city appropriate $20,000
and the company will contribute $20,000
this year toward the erection of the
bridge.
Interested property owners asked that
Duncan street be extended at a cost of
$12,000; several citizens requested that
Buena Vista Park be improved at a cost
of $35,000.
A. P. Van Duzer asserted that some of
the emergency hospitals could be abol
ished and the -saving. In â¢ salaries would
give sufficient money to repave Valencia
street from Eighteenth to Thirtieth. Van
Duzer objected to the item of $2000 to pay
the old Panhandle Commission, which he
said had been declared-, illegal by. the
courts. He also held that the appropria
tion of $56,000 for; Janitors 'was in excess
cf the work done. He thought $6000 should
be lopped off there and $1400 taken from
the Bureau of Architecture. Van Duzer
further believed that the $65,000 for street
repairing should be increased three-fold.
ASK FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
The budget shows i $255,266 less for im
provements this year than.' last," said
Center, "yet the 'Bureau of Engineering
gets $60,000,. or $12,000 more than the Audi
tor recommended. This shows a mass of
money to be spent by the Board of Public
Works without any results, and it seems
to be getting : worse all the time. It is
your duty to go over this budget carefully
and cut down some of the items. You will
then have money for public, improve
ments." . . Â¦ ' ' .
William Fahey, president of the Fifth

paving or -Fifth -street -from Folsom to

William J. Herrin,' representing the Lar

of $23,800. Â¦ , " : x .. ;Â¦
George Center, representing the Mission
Improvement Clubs, stated that it. was the
desire of his organization to have money
provided for improvements. ,
The University, Mound and Bay View
Improvement Club asked for a new
schoolhouse.
! Edward Ewaid and A. E. Burkman, rep
resenting the Sunset district, petitioned
for street improvements in that district,
as -private enterprise contemplated large
building operations!
The board heard 'a large number of citi
zens, property owners and representatives
of various improvement cluos regarding
the appropriations in the budget. The
board was urged to provide for many im
provements not specified in the recom
mendation of the Finance Committee, but
action on the petitions was postponed.
CITIZENS DISCUSS BUDGET.
Commissioner. .Hutton said that the
charter had never been complied with; In
that it provided for one polipeman in
every 500 ot population, whicn would give
700, patrolmen to the department. , Â¦Â¦'
. Mve men are now doing seven men's
work," said Hutton, "and it is your duty
to remedy conditions by providing suffi
cient funds for our needs. I- am not here
to tell this -board how to do it, but there
are items in. the budget that could be
eliminated, notably the Park Emergency
Hospital." Â¦..*"â¢Â¦Â¦%'Â¦Â¦;'',/: Â¦-..-
Commissioner ' Mahoney pleaded for
more funds, . but would not discuss the
means whereby the money should be
raised. : Â¦ . Â¦Â¦ _Â¦Â¦>Â¦..:â¢
Newhall and Howellalso
declared T themselves in favor of 'an in
crease In retail liquor licenses. Howell
said that 50. per cent of the arrests were
tor drunkenness, anu he held that those
causing this condition should bear half
the expense of the Police Department.
Chief of Police Wittman said that it was
planned to put the eight-hour watch sys
tem in operation anu more men are re
quired, wittman said that there were
large, growing- districts which nad no po
lice patrol whatever, and it was surpris
ing, tnat; so mucn was accomplished with
so few men. ' ' - :
"Jf we can. get the retail liquor license
increased' to unreasonableâ not an exor
bitant ngure^it win give us enough to
properly police this city," said Wittman.
"i ihlnK the saloons can stand a license
of fcaw per year. I believe the retail, liquor
cieaiers : wouid be' satisfied and It would
give us $350,000 increase. The ' license
might be graded according to the locality.

George A. Newhall, .president of the Po
lice Commission, said that the department
needed more men and that sufficient
money had not been provided.
"What we want are young, able-bodied
men," said Newhall, "as we are now
working some old officers who should bo
pensioned."
Two Members." of the Board of Police
Commissioners and Chief of Police Witt
man last night declared themselves in
favor of increasing the retail liquor

Denver courts have got together and set
tltti the dispute by .consolidating all the

Councilmen holding to 1901 and' the re
maining three to . 1903 was Â¦Â¦ overlooked or

error.' In 1900 D. ; A. .Porter and. Joseph

OAKLAND, May 23.â The appeal of
Mrs. Mary Thompson, who was convicted
of selling liquor within the mile limits of
the university, was argued by Assistant
District Attorney Walsh and Richard
Lloyd in Judge Melvin's court to-day.
Attorney Lloyd first attacked the decision
of Justice Edgar of Berkeley, refusing
Mrs. Thompson a change of venue on the
ground of bias, but Judge Melvln held
that the point was not well taken. He
then argued that Mrs. Thompson could
not be punished for offenses except thoso
committed on the day named in the com
plaint, holding that evidence of offenses
committed on other days could not be
admitted. Judge Melvin took that ques
tion under advisement and will render a
decision later. Two other appeals will be
heard Monday.

cannot attach to the city. In providing
for public improvements a" city is employ
ing the. money of the inhabitants to af
ford them necessary utilities.
Attorney Nusbaumer, for the plaintiff,
contended that the city in this case had
entered into the business of selling light
to private persons and therefore. It was
on the same level with other private con
cerns. He urged that the city then as
sumed control and direction of a public
improvement and that It assumed with it
the responsibility connected therewith.
Judge Greene, however, did not receda
from the position he assumed early in
the argument and granted the nonsuit
prayed for by Attorneys Simpson and

dying woman's statement that she had
taken a violent drug and performed an
operation on herself. She never mention
ed any injuries received in her scuffle
with Robert Reeves on the afternoon of
May 12. He further reiterated his state
ment, formerly made In the papers, that
the woman's body showed no bruises or
marks of outward violence.
Then Dr. Gladding, who had taken th<Â»
stand last Monday with defiance in his
eye. took his seat beside his former en
emy with his face wreathed in smiles. He
answered all questions put to him volu
fcly and readily.
DYING WOMAN'S STATEMENT.
The proceedings of ihe inquest were
here enlivened by a formal reconciliation
between Coroner Mehrmann and his for
mer recalcitrant witness. Dr. Charles F.
Gladding. Attorney Whitney apologized
on behalf of Dr. Gladdlns and Coroner
Mthrrnann gracefully received the fiery
physician back into his good graces.
'"The court," said Coroner Mehrmann,
"had no intention of censuring any wit
ness unjustly. My friend the doctor's
nerve tension was a little stronger than
necessary on last Monday night. The
court"s sentence with the consent of the
jurors 5s removed."
Professor George Colby, a chemist from
the State University, who had made a
chemical examination of the dead wom
an's stomach, testified that there were no
traces of corrosive poisoning present.
NO TRACE OF POISONING.
Dr. Gladding, who refused at a former
meeting of the inquest to divulge the
dead woman's deathbed statement as to
the cause of her death, was present after
having patched up his differences with
Coroner Mehrmann, and stated that Mrs.
Marsellis made a confession that her Ill
ness was due to a self-inflicted operation.
The first witness to be' heard at to
night's session of the inquest was "Jeff"
l>ewis, who was recalled to the stand. He
testified that the cause of his visit to the
Marsellis house on the night of May 11
was a desire to gain possession of his
watch and some money, which Mrs. Mar
sellis had in her possession. He denied
having threatened either the dead woman
or her husband with punishment for with
holding the articles. He was certain that
Mrs. Marsellis was not injured in the
rough and tumble fight which took place
between himself and her husband that
night.
BERKELEY, May 23.â Out of a mass of
conflicting evidence and contradictory
theories advanced by physicians, the jury
called to investigate the death of Mrs.
Marsellis at Berkeley on May 16, rendered
a verdict to-night to the effect that the
woman had met her death as the result
of a rupture and consequent hemorrhage
from the hepatic artery, due to an un
known cause. In thts the Jury supports
the theory of Dr. Rowell and Dr. Vayne.
the autopsy physicians, who maintained
at the first session of the inquest that
such a rupture could only arise as the re
sult of violence, but they fail to fix the
blame for the perpetration of this vio
lence upon any one.
Smith had completed his rounds for the
night and was driving toward home at
Fruitvale. While his horse was jogging
along Park avenue the three highway
men stepped into the street, one grabbing
the horse's bridle, his companions order
ing Smith to get off the seat. - v The driver
did not hesitate, for he saw two revol
vers aimed at his head.
Quickly his pockets were searched and.
that job finished, Smith was ordered
back to his wagon and told to drive away
iquickly and not to turn around. --â¢ â¢
The milkman obeyed, but instead of
continuing home he drove to the police
station and reported the occurrence. He
could give only a meager description of
the men who robbed him.
A trio of footpads held up Barton
Smith, a one-armed milkman, at 4 o'clock
this morning on Park avenue, between
East . Tenth and East Eleventh streets.
Two of ! the highwaymen pointed pistols
at the dairyman's head, while the third
one held his horse's head. Smith parted
under the pressure with. $3 50, and as the
robbers departed they carried off -a can
of milk, which they took. from their vic
tim's wagon. J ' .

Ex-State Senator Harry. V. Morehouse
Is the defendant in. a suit brought by
Einest V. Rlchter, the trial of which was
begun yesterday before Justice of the

Richter, who is a masseur and hydropath,
treated Morehouse's daughter for inflam
matory, rheumatism. For this . service
Richter demanded $214, and for treating
Morehouse himself Ricbter wanted ' $8.
Morehouse expressed himself as willing
to confess judgment for $8, but he refused
to pay the bill f6r the treatment of: his
daughter on the ground that he made no
contract with Richter. and that the -young
lady is over age. Morehous* further con

.Cristall continues to keep the opposing
base runners glued to first. Sheehan tried
to play oft in Thursday's game, but- the
southpaw caught him a foot off the bag.
Mohler made a wonderful catch during
the progress of the great nlneteen-inning
contest. A ball was hit over in the direc
tion of right field fence and Mohler, Streib
and' McCreedie started after it. - The last
two gave up the chase, but the little fel
low, ran between them and nailed the
ball with one band.
Harris will probably have a strong
team by. July 4, at least He is negotiat
ing with four stars of the first water, but
refuses to divulge their names.
: Hogan, Fisher's amateur from San Jose,
is making a great .record in the field. If
he can only. get in and whack out a few
base hits, he will be the goods.
! Gorton has* taken 'a great slump in his
batting this series. Last week he led
the team, but he failed to make a hit In
the last two games.
Only four men on the Oakland teamâ
Streib, Dunleavy, Schmidt and Francksâ
hit the ball safely in the entire nineteen
Innings at Oakland on Wednesday. This
gait will never win a pennant.
Many of 'the fans rated Hodson as a
dead one, yet he leads all the pitchers,
having won five games out of six..
The Grand Forks and Fargo teams
played twenty-five innings without a run
being made, July 18. 1891, at Devils Lake,
N. D., the longest game on record.
It seems strange Fisher should release a
good batter and keep in his stead a fast
fielder. Rebsamen was ponderous in his
movements, but he was a hard hitter.
Wagner is a first-class man in the field,
but woefully weak with the club. He
seldom drives . a ball out of the infield.
As Fisher has decided to hold him, the
sporting public hopes he will develop into
a slugger.
THE champion Oakland team is begin
ning to slump in Its batting, .which is
a serious matter, especially when a
baseball nine is setting a mark. If
Oakland could hit up to its fielding mark.
It would be second to no 'ball nine in the
world.

Anglers also suggest the framing of an

take flngerllngs by the hundreds and thus
help depopulate the trout streams.

it has been decided to hold a few track

He > also expressed the conviction that
races of one mile in length would be long
enough to test the speed and 'the stam
ina of contestants and would prove much
more Interesting and exciting to the spec
tators than the regular mlle-and-a-half
championship events. He stated the peo
ple of Oakland want to see a well-con
ducted series. of keert races, but do not
care at all whether they are championship
or not, or what the exact length of the
course may be, Â¦ W. B. Hlnchman, presi
dent of the Pacific Association of tho
Amateur Athletic Union; was desirous of
retaining as much of the appropriation a3
possible in the shape of prizes for the
localoarsmen. The Lake Merritt regatu
seems likely to be the only large general
rowing regatta of the year, and the Pa
cific Association officials wLsh to make It
a championship event. *
The sum of one thousand dollars has
been granted for the afternoon festivities,
by far the most - important of which will
be â¢ the rowing races. S. J. Pembroke,
captain of the Olympic Boat Club, was
in attendance and strongly urged the de
sirability of bringing large crews and
single scullers down from British Colum
bia and Portland, to give the races an
international character. That this might
be done he suggested the prizes for the
rowing races be of moderate value, thus
leaving more to be expended in trans
portation and hotel bills for the north

EARLY, in the week the celebration
committee of the citizens of Oakland
and representatives of thÂ© rowing clubs
met in trie Merchants* Exchange at
Oakland and discussed the July 4th
regatta on Lake Merritt.
Britt works hard daily. "Spider" Kelly
is looking after his training and the
Olympic Club boxer Is in superb condition.
He has agreed to box George McFadden
in June if he wins from Lavigne.
Lavigne is being handled by MarK
Shaugnnessy and his brother "Billy." He
Bays he never felt in better, condition. He
is the picture of health and feels aa
strong as a backwoodsman.
The "Kid" has battled his way to the
top of the fistic ladder and has always
borne an excellent reputation for game
ness in the ring. When he fights, his op
ponent is watchful, as he is a dangerous
customer. Lavigne punches with both
hands and when he lands something us
ually drops. He proved he has not gone
back by taking Tim Hegarty's measure
in quick order. He has taken splendid
care of himself for several years and will
give a good account of himself. . â¢ . -
-Britt is ambitious to reach the top* of
the pugilistic ladder of fame and is grad
ually working his way upward. That he
can fight, was evidenced in his previous
contests. The public will see a hot battle
while it lasts, as the men are willing and
aggressive fighters.
When Britt ceases training the day be
fore the fight he will have practically fin
ished a solid year of hard exercise. He
haa been under the strain, of constant
training since last May, having engaged
in an amateur and a professional contest
every month since that time.. Lavlgne's
headquarters at the Six Mile are besieged
every day by scores of visitors, who jour
ney over the big hill to - see the Saginaw'
boxer go through his training stunts.
This will be the first real test of Britt, as
Lavigne la considered . the moat serious
stumbling block in the way of Britt' s
championship aspirations.
NOW that Fitzslmmons and Jeffries
have arranged their meeting, the in
terest of local ring-goers is centered
on the coming, boxing contest be
tween "Jimmle" Britt of this city and
;'Kid" Lavigne of Saginaw, Mich. They
are to battle in Woodward's Pavilion next
Thursday night under the auspices of the
San Francisco Athletic Club. Britt is

Next week the Santa j Cruz team will
pay its first visit of the season ; to San
Francisco, and on Decoration day will
play against the Pacific eleven at Ala
meda. On Saturday, May 31, the Santa
Cruz cricketers will begin their match
against the Alameda eleven.- A.. G.
Sheath, who played with the Santa Cruz
club last season, has resigned his mem
bership. It is not expected that Harold
Richardson will play more than orice^or
twice this year, as he is living at Bakw-s
fleld. E. G. Sloman's name, however, is
on the membership roll, and so is that of
H. H. Cookson.
The Pacific. eleven last Sunday com
pletely reversed its usual habit, which is
to make a strong opening and break
down later. .Casidy, Coles and Wilding
scored only 14 runs between them, and
the first six wickets fell for 28 runs; but
F. Bennion, 24, J. J. â¢ Theobald; 30 not
out, and T. J. A. Tiedeman, 11, brought
the score up to the respectable total of
103. The Alameda team fell all to pieces,
F. J. Croll, 10, being the only man to
score double figures.* Casidy and Kort
lang disposed of the whole eleven with
48 balls, six of the batsmen adding noth
ing to the score. In their second in
nings the Alameda men did better, F, J.
Croll scoring 19 and Harold Ward 11. I H.
G. Fortmann and Arthur Dickinson did
not bat, . and the innings ended for 52
runs, making a total of. 70 for two in
nings. The Pacifies accordingly won the
second pennant match of the season by
33 runs and an innings,- and their record
now stands â Matches played, 2; won, 2;
lost, 0. B. Kortland, a recent arrival
from Australia, proved a most effective
bowler, with good length and break. He
is a valuable addition to the Pacific team.

'(; A GOOD GAME AT CHICAGO
This afternoon the San Franciscos will
cruise to Paradise Cove, where they will
anchor for the night. To-morrow there
â¢will be a clambake on the shore. To pass
the time while the clams and other good
things are being cooked, Â¦ there will be
Bwinuning, yawl, sack and tub races, a
trial of speed for fat men and a tug-of
Â¦war. It is possible a pennant will be of
fered the yacht first picking up .her
rooorings at Sausalito, the crews of the
various craft taking station on the beach,
pulling off to their yachts, hoisting sail
and weighing 1 'anchor at a given signal.
The event is in charge of a committee
consisting of J. F. Log-an, R. D. Noble,
W. W. Haley, A. R. Haskins and J. C.
IVeirs.
The preliminary signal for the race will
be given at 1:25 p. m. next Saturday, and
the start will take place on the fire of a
signal gun at 1:30 p. m. It has
been decided in view of the great
Interest felt in the contest to
charter a steamer, tickets to which
will be sold for 50 cents, for the ac
commodation of the many spectators who
â¢will desire to get a good view of th<>
racing yachts. Dr. T. L. Hill is a com
mittee on chartering the steamer. T. J.
Kavanaugh Is charged with the duty of
securing a leeward stakeboat and P. J.
Martenstein will arrange for the stake
boa'ts off Meiggs wharf.
NEXT week will be one of the busiest
that has ever occurred in local
yachting. On Decoration day the
seventeenth annual Corinthian Club
regatta and the ninth annual class flag
regatta of the California Yacht Club wil!
take place over the regular courses.
The Corinthian races will be under the
management of the regatta committee,
which consists of E. B. Learning, T. J.
Kavanaugh and P. J. Martenstein. The
yachts will be divided into six classes,
Â¦which will be started at intervals' of ten
minutes. There is a large entry list, and
the races promise to be fully as interest
ing as usual.
Frank Stone's Presto will sail in the 30
foot class and Sharpe & Toepke's Har
poon will go round the course in the 56
foot class as a preliminary for the chal
lenge cup race on May 3L In order to
accommodate the spectators a steamer
v.ill accompany the yachts, tickets being
on sale to the general public.
The California Yacht Club regatta "will
be under the management of the regatta
committee, which consists of August R.
F. Brandes, C. A. Loring and W. H. Wil
liamson. As the first mark in the regatta
is Blossom Rock buoy, which is also one
of t*e turning points in the Corinthian
races, the California yachts, which will be
close-hauled in coming up to the buoy,
â¢will yield the right of way to the Co
rinthian yachts, which will be under light
sails. Any time lost by so doing will be
allowed on application to the regatta com
mittee. It being low water at 11:08 on the
morning of Decoration day, the races will
take place wholly on a flood tide.
On Saturday, May 31, the race for the
Perpetual challenge cup will take place
between the San Francisco Yacht Club's
new Eloop The Challenger and Sharpe &
Toepke's sloop Harpoon, which will de
fend the trophy on behalf of" the Co
rinthians, its present holders. The re
sratta committees of the two clubs met on
Monday last and settled nearly all the de
taJs of the race.
The contest between the challenging and
the defending yachts will be unusually in
teresting, as The Challenger was designed
by one of the most noted Eastern design
ers, and Is a fip-keel sloop built specially'
lor racing. The defender is a center
board craft designed and built by a na
tive Calif ornian. The opinion of yachts
men as to the outcome of the race is
much more divided than it was some
weeks ago, when nearly all conceded vic
tory to the challenging yacht. The excel
lent performance of the sloop Harpoon,
vhich defeated Frank Stone's Presto by
nearly fourteen minutes' actual sailing
time over the fourteen-mile course, has
caused the Corinthians to be much more
hopeful and the San Franciscos much less
confident as to the result. It is believed
that a strong wind will favor Harpoon
and that a light breeze will increase the
chances of The Challenger. W. G. Mor
row, captain of The Challenger, believes
that, her sail plan was too large. It has
beeii reduced, so her racing length will be
considerably under thirty feet as stated
in the letter of challenge. The San Fran
cisco committee has asked that the time
fillowance to be received by The Chal
lenger be based on her actual racing
length as ascertained by measurement
end not on the stated length of thirty
feet, which was only approximate. This
point was referred to the Corinthian di
rectors, as the regatta committee of the
defending club, while having full power
to decide all matters connected with the
race, did not desire to settle this point
on their own responsibility.
A COMMITTEE has been appointed by
ttie American Coursing Board to se
lect a time and a place for the run
ning of this year's American Water
loo. The committee is made up of L. F.
Bartels of Denver (chairman), J. H. Roa
seter of San Francisco, J. J. Lavin of St.
Louis S. F. Handy of Minneapolis and
W J. Erwin of Honey Grove, Tex.
The meeting was held in St. Louis, Mo.,
last year, and Judge Grace of this city
officiated in the saddle. This year it will
probably be held at Sherman, Tex. The
date of the meeting will be given serious
consideration by the committee. Late m
November is the time favored by the
ccursing men. This will afford them an
opportunity to run their dogs in the rich
Futurity stake and in the John Grace
cup stake. It will also afford the Eastern
coursing men an opportunity to send their
dogs for the principal stakes. This will
bring to the front the best greyhounds,
from which a selection can be made of
dogs worthy to compete for the American
If held* late In November It will un
doubtedly attract a large entry and
"class" would be more thoroughly repre
sented than in past years.
The draw for the California Coursing
Committee stake will be held next
Wednesday night. This stake will be the
feature of the card for next week's meet
ing at Union Park, which will extend over
three days, commencing with Decoration
day. Beacon, Palo Alto, Rector and Ho
mer Boy will form a quartet of perform
ers hard to beat. The courses between
any two of these will be on the sensa
tional order.
The special coursing train for Union
Park will leave Third and Townsend
streets at 1 p. m. to-day. The attraction
this afternoon will be the first round of a
sixty-four-dog open stake. The remain
ing rounds and a twenty-four-dog special
stake will furnish the sport at the park
to-morrow. The probable winners in the
run-down of the two stakes look to be:
Special stake â America. Game Boy, Loyal
Lad. Narcissus, Lost Chord, Fannie Hughie,
Fontenoy, Flying Fox, Dewdrop, Santonin.

At the session of , the Grand Court of
the Foresters of America recently held in
Stockton it was decided that there should
be a grand initiation of Foresters in vari
ous parts of the jurisdiction, and the mat
ter has been taken hold of by the courts
of this city. Three delegates from each
court have been. appointed to a conven
tion that Is to meet every Friday night to
perfect plans and carry out the idea. The
courts of Alameda County, Marin County
and. Santa Clara County have been asked
to assist. Last night there was a meeting
of the delegates In the Alcazar building
with J. G. Chase Jr., acting as president,
and an outline of the work was presented.
It was decided to have a parade- on the
evening of August 15, to be followed by
initiation, in one of the large halls, of at
least five hundred candidates. On the fol
lowing night a grand. ball will be held in
ceiebration of Foresters' day. Commit
tees on hall, parade, music and promo
tion were appointed.
. -The committee on promotion will be re
quired to visit all the courts and boom
the project. At the -next meeting the
committees will present reports, and .It
will then be ' known where the ceremony
of Initiation and the ball will be held. It

Correa, the Nicaraguan Minister, called
on Secretary Hay to-day and assured htm
of the willingness of his Government to

the Government of Nicaragua has been
very stiff. The campaign of the Pan

entirely to declarations that what has
happened in Martinique is likely to take
place in Lake Nicaragua.. It Is probable
that this scare will have the effect of
saving the United States several million
dollars If the Nicaragua route Is adopted.

suite should board the Montcalm, in order
that they be not deprived of the pleasure
of the visit.
The President entertained their Majes
.ties at luncheon. Loubet toasted the Czar
as follows: , .
"Sire: In coming on board the Montcalm
you have done the French navy an honor
which it will profoundly appreciate. The
sentiments of our sailors for their brave
comrades of the Russian navy manifest
themselves on every occasion that offers.
Whether In the Eastern seas, the Mediter
ranean or elsewhere, their fraternity evi
dences the union of their countries. I
shall carry away a warm and Imperish
able memory of my visit to this hospitable
empire, and France, which has heard with
joy the welcome extended to her repre
sentative, will remain faithful to the al
liance of which Russia, In common with
France, so fully appreciates the benefit.
I drink to the honor of the valiant Rus
sian navy."
. The Czar replied as follows:
"It Is infinitely agreeable to the Czar
ina and myself to again find ourselves
In the midst of the brave French sailors
and It is with especial pleasure that we
feel that , we are actually in France on
this fine vessel. We cordially thank you
for this visit. Mr. President, and beg you
to convey our most cordial greetings' 'to
France, the faithful friend and Steadfast
ally of Russia. I raise my glass to the
prosperity of the glorious navy of
h ranee. . ., .
At the conclusion of the toasts on the
French cruiser "The Marseillaise' "and
the Russian anthem were played As hP

his expressions of the extreme pleasure
afforded him by. the visit of PVesident

WITH THE CZAR
OAKLAND, May 23.â The athletes
of the Oakland High School have
elected Thomas Coyne captain of
the track team for the coming
year. The election Is held upon
the eve of the close of school in order that
the new captain may prepare his plans
during vacation and be ready tOs carry on
the work when v the, school opens for the
winter.
The new captain has always taken a
great interest in the athletic events of the
high school,- and has taken a prominent
part In the contests of the 'Amateur Aca
demic League and of the inter-high
school contests of the coast. Coyne
is a lcng-dlstance runner, and last year
won the half-mile run for the Oakland
High School in the Amateur Academic
contest in 2:0S 1-5. He has been on four
winning relay teams for the Oakland High
School and is very popular with the bud
ding athletes. It is expected that he will
put a winning " track team in the field
during the coming season.
FORESTERS TO HOLD
MONSTER- INITIATION
DURING the next week there will be
three tennis tournaments played on
the local courts. The first will Ue
the academic doubles, which will ba
played this morning on the California
Club courts. The second will be the class
singles tournament on the park courts to
morrow and the third will be for the
championship of San Francisco, which
will be decided on the club courts. ThU
event has become an annual affair and
will be played on Decoration day oÂ£ each
year.
George Whitney is the present cham
pion, but instead of merely defending his
title as in the other championships, he
will be called upon to go through the
rounds of the tournament. Being a cham
pionship event, it will be open to all, and
there will undoubtedly be a large number
of the park experts on hand to take part.
The tournament will commence next Fri
day and will be finished on the following
Sunday. All matches' but the finals will
be two sets out of three. The finals will
be three out of five. Whitney is expected
to win again without much trouble, but
there will be some interesting matches
when the crack players of the park and
the club experts come together.
This is the off season for tournaments
on the California Club courts and none
will be held there until n^xt winter. The
only events the summer are the
State and coast championships to be held
in July and September respectively.
The second of a series of class tour
naments for the challenge cups will be
held to-morrow on the park courts. The
holders are Will Allen of the first class
and Kenneth Marr of the second. The
cups are to be won three times. The forty
four men who entered the first tourna
ment are the only ones eligible to take
part in future matches. Several of the
local club cracks were anxious to play hi
one of these tournaments, but the facs
that it was closed kepi them from trying
conclusions with the park players. .-'-,:
The drawing for the tournament result
ed as follows: First class, preliminary
roundâ G. K. Bates vs. L. R. Thiebault.
First round â J. A. Code vs. H. E. Routh;
W. D. Geary a bye; JW. B Lee vs. W. Al
len; Charles Dunlap vs. T. W. Tetley.
Second class, preliminary roundâ M. C.
Campbell vs. Scott Lewis; A. Beyfuss V3.
Kenneth Marr; G. Reading vs. R.- W.
Turner. First roundâ L. \V. Kaiser vs.
J. L. Smith; J. B. Adams vs. S. H. Routh;
W. F. Staff vs. L. C. Bozart; E. H. Clear
vs. C. Coleman: M. A. Edwards vs. A.
McFarland; C. Griffin vs. W. C. Webster;
Philip Martin vs. D. W. Kamp; W. A.
Twiggs a bye; G. Eacret vs. H. A.
Turner; G. F. Osborne vs.. W. McKenna;
J. M. Baker vs. A. Player; Harry Baer
vs. Ed Finnigan; T. D. Black vs. E. F.
Leilach; G. A. Cummlngs vs. B. McFar
land; E. Miller vs. G. James.
The first class "will without doubt .be
won by either Allen, Routh or Dunlap.
Allen is favorite and will probably again
win the cup. In the second class the play
ers are evenly matched, but Kenneth
Marr is a slight favorite.
The organization of a club among th-s
park players was a good move, and in
future the tournaments will be run off
much more smoothly than In the past."
This club will probably have the largest
membership list of any tennis club in the
West.
The doubles tournament for the cham
pionship of the Academic League will be
played this morning at 9:30. The singles
were won by Polytechnic High School last
Saturday, and that school is a strong fa
vorite in the doubles. The absence of
Rosenberg of Lowell makes It rather easy
for Polytechnic. Rosenberg and Beyfu33
would have given Geary and Mann a bard
fight, and many were of the opinion they
would win. Rosenberg's place will be ta
ken by Arthur Jones. The latter was a
good player at one time, but at present la
out of practice.
The following, teams have entered to
day's event: Harry Gorham and Leonard
Cutler, California School of Mechanical
Arts; N. Ambrose and Esterly, Berkeley
High School; Henry Mills and G. Ridley,
Trinity School; C. Lewis and M. Epstein,
Alameda High School; Hinds and Smith,
Oakland High School; Will Geary ami
Horace Mann, Polytechnic High School;
Alec Beyfuss and Arthur Jones, Lowell
High School.
THE Oakland artists did not ihave to
exert, themselves to any degree yes
terday .to make Fisher's world-beat
ers look like a lot of aspiring coppers
who failed to pass the civil service
examinations. It was one of those unin
teresting, ..go-as-you-please sort of func
tions, with Ewing continually clutching
the soft side of the score and liable to
break In and do things at any old time.
Hodson unwound himself for Ewingand
pitched a high art quality of ball. He was
touched for eight safe bumps, but showed
the true pitcher's; art in keeping 'them
scattered all along the line of battle. He
would' walk a man. when in doubt arid
then; turn in and throw. it over to the
next indivjdual, who was likely to hit the
ball to the infield and help complete one
ol these fast double plays I which have
made the stone wall inneld useful as well
as orhamental. -\ . Â¦ ". . ; Â¦";â ;.. , . . .
â¢-Fisher' chose Doyle to serve them up for
the Senatorial carpet-baggers, and he was
all right except when Oakland needed .a
run. Then he ceased being the real arti
cie. On aJl. such occasions he was wal
loped In a lively mannerâ not too lively^
but just fast enough to give i Mike a
chance to see the runs being hung up in
bunches of two at a time. ". They always
came In twos and in ; three \ l different
rounds, while the Senators earned; one.;.
The first pair of Oakland'toddlers-ar
rived at the pan in the third spasm, aid
ed by Lohman's single",^Walters' double
and Streib's base hit. Singles by Hodson'
and- Streib and a base on 1 balls brought
two more around in the sixth, and two
more safe bangs, with the help, of Wag
ner's muff of Devereaux's -easy fly, put
the finishing touches on the day's sport.
The carpet-baggers only went through
a single run-getting act^ and that was in
the fifth. Unglaub put down a neat bunt
in the direction of third and Hogan sent
him to third-onadrive toleft field. Bon^
saved a shut-out by biffing after the man
ner of the youngster.
The carpet-baggers i had numerous
chances to make runs. They frequently
got two on. the bags and sometimes as
many as three, but that most essential
thing in baseball,.. the^ welcome base hit,
was continually lacking. They found no
dilKculty in connecting with Hoddie's
crookedness when no. one held down the
bags, but at the right time they could not
deliver the goods.* Â¦ - .
Bone cut. a. few capers out in left for
Fisher and Incidental^ struck out twice
when a hit meant more than hard-cash
Hogan drove it : safely twice out of aa
many times at.bat. Dunleavy's error was
the result of dropping Unglaub's hard fly
to the fence in the seventh. Hodson made
a J, un ' 2 h1 } and a c 'ever sacrifice and
will strike for I a raise in salary Mc-
Creedie retired in the seventh in favor of
smiling Schmidt. The score:

SECURES PROFIT
THROUGH SCARE
The men are to meet in this city on the
night of July 25th. Both principals were
opposed to a flght out of doors in the day
time. Jeffries did not attend the meeting
yesterday, his interests being carefuily
guarded by Billy Delaney and Kid Egan.
Fitzsimmons spoke for himself and
proved a master hand at arranging the
details for a fight. He was evidently
primed with statistics of the Jeffries-
Ruhlin contest, as he referred to that con
test frequently. He j had . his figures
twisted in one instance when he said
returns were made for only 300 spectators
in the gallery. An official of the club
corrected him, saying returns were made
on more than 2900 tickets for the gallery.
The club officials, with Fitzsimmons,
Delaney and Egan, went Into executive
session and discussed the details of the
fight for three hoursl Prices of admission
â¢were first taken up. The only thing defi
nite decided upon in this particular was
that $5 would be charged for admission
to the gallery. Doors are to be opened at
4 o'clock if the fighters think it neces-.
sary. .'::/- :; ; . '
The question of the "moving picture"
privilege resulted in a long and a heated
debate. Delaney finally said the club
cculd have anything they made out of the
privilege if Jeffries won the fight. Fitz
simmons then agreed to give. 20 Â¦ per
ctnt of the proceeds from the pictures
and this amount was Inserted in the ar
ticles.
Further discussion was stirred up. over
thfc compensation of the referee. This of
ficial is to be paid by the club and Alex.
Greggains objected to allowing him $500
for his services. Eddie Graney said he
would not accept less. The matter was
finally left for future consideration. \.
The preliminary will probably be be
tween Jack Jeffries and Tom Wilson,
Fitzslmmons* sparring partner.
Billy Delaney leaves for Harbin Springs
tc-day to arrange for Jeffries* training
quarters. Fitzsimmons â¢ and his I party
leave to-day for Skaggs Springs, where
they will settle down at once to I the
humdrum of training. "With eight' weeks
in which to train it is not expected either
man will do much hard work for the first
month. They will live out of doors. and
lay up a store of vitality for. the real
training work. 'Â¦',-.'-'
The fighters insisted on the club putting:
up a $5000 forfeit which will be. divided
between the fighters If the club, cannot
carry out its contract. Each. of th'e fight
ers, put up certified checks for $2500 in"
the hands of Sam Thall, the stakeholder.

Special Disoatch to The Call.
WILLOWS, May 23.â In the Superior
Court of Glenn County some time ago,
Judge Pirkey, in the suit brought by the
bondholders of Central Irrigation District
to confirm the organization of the district
and the issuance of bonds, decided against
the validity of the bonds and the district.
Attorney R. Percy Wright appeared for
the bondholders at the beginning of the
trial, but Judge Pirkey ruled that he
could not be heard, as he had no stand
ing in the case, and refused to permit him
to tane any part in the -proceedings.
After the decision in this case was ren
dered, Wright rtled a bill of exceptions on
behalf of the bondholders and two weeks
ago appeared before Judge Pirkey to have
his bill of exceptions ruled upon, to en
able him to penect his appeal. Freeman
,5c Donohoe resisted this application, on
the grounds that the bondholders had no
standing in the case and were not entitled
to nn appeal. Judge Pirkey sustained this
view. . â ' . . . _ .
Wright' applied to the Supreme Court
for a writ of mandate to compel Judge
Pirkey to settle his bill of exceptions.
This application .was bitterly resisted by
the , attorney for the defense. The Su
preme Court confirmed the Glenn County
Judge's decision and refused the writ.
It is said that this leaves the bond
holders without right to appeal from
Judge Pirkey's decision and that tho de
cision he rendered some time ago in the
confirmation suit Is now final and abso
lutely binding. This may be considered
as a deathblow to the bondholders in this
litigation and undobtedly will result in
settling the differences out of court.

Ruban. .seventy-six years of age, was

Augustus Avery is a civil engineer of
the Mount Tamalpais Land and Water
Company and also city surveyor of Mill
Valley.
In. Mrs. Avery's answer she stoutly de
nies all of the allegations made In the
complaint and files a cross-complaint
charging her husband with desertion.
Avery asserts that on several occasions
his wife proclaimed her desire to lead a
gay and hilarious life and not one after
his \ home-loving style.
Avery avers that his wife has chided
him continually by asserting that she did
not care to live with a man of his tran
quil habits; that she desired a husband
who wouia get angry once in a while and
slap her and mistreat her; that she pre
ferred one who would lead a gay life and
not be too domestic in his habits. Ha
also alleges that Mrs. Eva Avery is not
a fit or competent person to retain the
care of their child, for the reason that
her fondness for the races and for gamb
ling and her mania for theaters would
affect the child's morals. .

himself yesterday very forcibly in saying
that there was no more cruelty than was
absolutely necessary on the part of the
United States troops in the Philippines.
Upon .landing Commissioner . Buenca

While here he will visit his two sons, who
are attending the University of Califor

NEW YORK, May 23. â To-day's stock mar
ket was dull to the point of stagnation. The
higlier prices in London induced an improve
mer.t at the opening here, but it was lost
through mere inanimation. Until the last hour
there was hardly enough motive power to show
any direction in the movement, with the ex
ception of. some special stocks.
There was quite a demand for the National
Lend stocks, due to the expectation that the
comi>any vould benefit from a proposed com
bination in an allied branch of the trade. The
American Linseed vtocks rose on rumoie of a
combination of the vegetable oil interest*. The
firmness cf Amalgamated Copper. Anaconda
and Smelting was due to the continued reports
of the widening demand for raw copper, both
here and abroad. The improvement in the cop
per trade is an influence extending far beyond
the stocks immediately affected. The allega
tion is made that the recent heavy exports of
.Â¦'ipj.fr are frolng abroad, in part at least, as
rtotks are. to get the benefit of the cheaper
money rates over there for holding purposes.
There was a renewal of the recent strength In
Canadian Pacific, but when the* advance
reached l-1i it halted. Pacinc Mall's 2%-polnt
rise was unexplained. The George A. Fuller
stocks made wide advances and the New York
public utilities and Colorado Fuel developed
late Flrensrth, the latter rising 2U. The ap
j>earance of the preliminary figures of the
week's movement of currency awakened more
animation than st any time during the day.
Outblde of those stocks already mentioned. Qm
â¢ ffect was not notable except in St. Paul,
Vnion Pacific and Atchison. The currency
'.i- jr<-j-- indicate a. net gain by the banks on the
interior movement of nearly $5,000,000, which
;k Â«-uDp!em' > ntÂ»'<l by a sain on Fub-Treasury op
eration* of $503,000. Bankers are generally
agrc-ed that there has been a further heavy
'Â¦ontractlon of loans and reduction of deposit
liabilities. It will be seen that the promise Is
for an extremely favorable bank statement.
The response in the Btock market was very
moderate. Possibly this was due to the fact
that the inward movement of currency has
been checked. New York exchange at Chicago
fell back to-day to near par. comsared with
Â«:0 certs premium early In the week. There
v.as transferred to-day through the sub-Treas
ury $?00,000 to New Orleans, following the
!!Ue amount transferred yesterday. There was
a c-all to-day for a 25 per cent installment of

Wheat arid Other Grains.
CHICAGO. May 23.â It. was a dull day In
wheat until shortly .before the close. Early In
the day there was some strength on cables,
confirmation of good export business yesterday
and light, receipts. .Price changes, however,
were very small most of the. morning. July
opened a shade higher to unchanged at 74%e
to 74c and sold up to 74&C. After this slight
1 advance the market hung dull and listless.
I There were numerous bearish Incentives but
I the bears were not Inclined early to do much
with them. Argentine shipments were liberally
: increased. The crop prospects were exceptiori
i ally good. In the' last hour of business the
j bears took advantage of the apparent lack of
! energy in the wheat market and put on pres-
I sure. Liquidation brought out some stop loss
orders ; there was no export support, and prices
slumped to a weak close, July %<@%c down at
73 >/Â»<Â§. 73 %e.
Corn ruled the strongest of the pits until
whtat broke. The small receipts were bullish
In their effects and offerings were small, but
crop prospects were toe-good to *lve the mnr
i.ket any decided bullish snap.. Wheat had a
Â¦weakening effect as the market grew dull.
July closed weak %@%c lower at 01 %c.
1 Oat* were the center of more interest than
I for several days paat. -The general tone most
of the day was strong, but trade was light
and the weakness in other grains worked
against the early advance. July closed a shade
lower at 37Vi@37%c.
Provisions had too narrow a market to al
low cf the general liquidation that was forced
by longs unloading. The close was weak. July
I pork closed 12%c lower, lard and ribs f>@7%c

Weather Report
chards in the central jjortion of the valley,
ivhlle in other orchards the prospects are fa
vorable fcr from a half to a full crop. Bart
lett pears will be short, but cherrips and Petite
prunes are promising. It is too early to Ml
much nbout apples, but the reports so far are
favorable, and it is thought that at least an
a-orspe crop will be obtained. Strawberries
are doing well and the first ripe Oregon berries
of the season were marketed from Hood River
during the latter part of the week.
The weather has been unfavorable for tree
fruit and the reports regarding the condition
of pruries ar.d pears are very conflicting:. Ital

The past -week has been unseasonably cool j
en1 cold, local rains have occurred almost
daily in the arestera part of the State, an'l

tlie Cascade Mountains. A sharp frost occurrel
Monday morning in Southern Oregon, and the
â¢Indentions are favorable for frost again on
Tuesday m"rr.ing. in all exposed localities, ex
cept the coast.
Both fa.ll and spring wheat continue to make
satisfactory progress, except on low and poorly
drained land in the Willamette Valley, where
thÂ» fall wheat keeps yellow and has a sjckly
Â»Fr**rance. It is thought new that some of
th'.s yellow wheat will not mature and that it
will later be out for fodder. Complaints are
elso being made that in Umatilla County the
fa!l wheat is unusua'ly weedy. Fall rye and
barley are bf^inning to head. Oats are doing
r.icely. and prass of all kinds is making a
luxuriant growth. .
Gardens are backward and very ww<y. ThÂ»
cool, wet weather has retarded the growth of
tender vegetables, but potatoes seem to be

The transaction did not cause a ripple to-day
in the lo-^al money market. The determined
waiting attitude of the market seems to be due
to the uncertainties of the coal strike and to
the approach of the critical period of the corn
crop. The latter is receiving more and more
attention every day and is destined to have a
greater influence on simulation than any
other one factor. Definite news is also
awaited of the Boer peace conference. Confi
dence is growing that there will be a favorable
outcome.

NEW YORK. May 23.â R. G. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade to-morrow will say:
Many mine labor controversies have been
settled, but the situation In the anthracite coal
region has assumed a more serious' aspect.
Railway earnings continue satisfactory, roads
reporting for. two weeks of May show gains of
6.1 per cent over last year and IS. 4 per cent
over 1900.
No change is reported in the iron and steel
situation, former < conditions merely â¢ becoming
intensified by the threatened decrease In sup
plies of fuel and the labor controversies in cer
tain branches of the Industry, t .,
The railroads are seeking; rails, rolling stock
and other equipment,, while contractors require
much structural material. ' Â¦
Slight concessions are now obtainable In
some lines of footwear, although the market
as a rule is fairly steady, but dull. Leather is
firmly held, while domestic packer hides again
made definite gains. .,
Quiet conditions have prevailed in the cereal
markets, with only a moderate volume of op
tion transactions and fractional changes in
quotations. Exports of wheat, including flour,
were only 3 p $63,fJCS bushels during the past
week, against 5.523,130 bushels ,in the corre
sponding week last year.
Failures for the week numbered 192 in the
United States against 180 last year and 12 in
Canada against 22 last year.

A meeting of the Forty-second Assem
bly District Club, under the auspices of
the Republican Mutual Alliance, was held
last night at Saratoga Hall with a large
audience in attendance. Lawrence Vin
cent explained the object of the alliance;
that it was to. do away with one-man
power and bosslsm and to give each mem
ber an individual expression in the or
ganization.
H. V. Morehouse spoke at length ana
'said that the election at San Jose was a
rebuke to the bosses and was the key
r.tte of the Republican .Mutual Alliance.

"W. Lewis also addressed the meeting.

transmitted at once to the Mayor, to the Board
of Supervisors and to the Board of Education.
Govl^nor Brady gave an instructive ac
count of the characteristics, mode of life,
customs and industries of the Alaskan
natives. He told the success that had
attended the work of William Duncan,
who established saw mills and canneries
for the employment of the natives. He
said that the Indians are paid liberally
Xor their work and that at the end of
each month when they are paid off they
purchase shares in the company. He said
that Duncan's canneries and mills have
become fo prosperous that the natives
who work in them have money in bank
and the products of the cannery are be
lns: shipped to all parts of the world.
The Presbyterian Mission Board of New-
York came in for some rather sharp criti
cism from Governor Brady for its dere
liction in not sending sufficient funds and
more competent men to Alaska. He said
that the board is making a mistake in
not looking after the commercial as well
as the religious welfare of the Indians.
Bince 1877 he said there has been a mirac
ulous improvement In their condition.
Mrs. Brady, wife of the Governor, also
spoke of the good work accomplished by
the missionaries. She said that the In
dian girls who were educated in the mis-
Eion schools made competent housekeep
ers and good and faithful wives.
John G. Brady, Governor of Alaska, de
livered an interesting address before the
ladies of the Occidental Board of Mis
sions at P20 Sacramento street yesterday
afternoon on "Alaska, its natives and
their need of practical missionary work."
Governor Brady said that he did not con
sider that the missionary work which has
been done up to the present time by the
Presbyterian Church has accomplished
the best results. He claimed that it was
not alone sufficient to go among the na
tives with hymn books and the Gospel
but that some steps must be taken to
promote their material welfare. He ad
vised that only practical men, who have
been specially prepared for the work, be
sent to Alaska and that saw mills, can
neries and basket works be established so
as to furnish employment for the natives.

Treasurer McDougald
Objects to Surety
Trust.
City Treasurer McDougald addressed a
communication yesterday. to the Board of
Supervisors urging that provision â¢ be
made in the next budget for a fund to
be applied to the payment of the pre
miums on the bonds of city officials. Me-
Dougald says in his communication that
when the officers elected last fall pro
ceeded to give the bonds required of them
under the charter they found themselves
confronted by a surety company trust.
Not only rrere the rates of premium
doubled but in addition each official was
by the trust compelled to take his bond
in a particular company at the trust rate.
McDougald says further: .
My predecessor as Treasurer furnished a sure
ty bend of *Kh),000 at an expense of $300 for
two years. The trust exacts from me a sim
ilar bond of $500 per year, at *hich rate I
would have to pay SlOuo for my term of two 1
years. The charter fixes the salary of the
Treasurer at $4000 per annum, but In point of
fact under existing conditions his salary Is but
$3500 per year.
Every other city officer is mulcted in more
or less degree and such a condition of affairs,
I submit, is not only unjust to the individual
but in contravention to the spirit of the char
ter. I submit to your candid judgment, gen
tlemen of the board, the proposition that the
city should defray the expense of bonding its
officials. This is the uniform practice In Los
Angeles and other cities of this State, in pri
vate business, in quasi-public bodies and in all
fraternal orders where bonds are exacted. That
this city should do likewise seems only fair
and right. In no other way can public officers
be protected against the unjust and oppressive
exactions to which they are now subject and
th^ surety companies deprived of the power to
improperly meddle, as they now do, in public
affairs. The city in defraying the expense of
bonding its officers could immediately destroy
the present trust by placing this business on
a competitive basis.
The exacting of bonds from subordinate offi
Â¦cials is a matter of option with the heads of
departments. In many cases, however, the
heads of departments are now deprived of all
discretion, the surety companies dictating what
herds shall be exacted and the amount thereof.
I believe that action on your part providing for
the bonding of all city employes at public ex
pense will meet with the approval of all citi
zens. The result will be that employes will
receive the full compensation to which they
are legally entitled.

f"if^ HERE will be a general meeting
IS of the Republican State Coramit-
I tee at CJolden Gate Hall, 625 Sut-
JJL- ter street, at 2 p. m. to-day. A
session of the executive commit
tee was held at the Palace Hotel last
night. The ... members attending were:

ant secretary; William J. Brady, W. J.

The report of a sub-committee to which
had been delegated the duty of framing
a call for State and district conventions
was taken up. discussed, amended and
adopted. It was decided to adopt 200 votes
as the basis of representation. This will
give a convention of 829 delegates. The
report leaves blank spaces for the time
and place of holding the convention, but
it is the general opinion of members that
the State Committee this afternoon will
designate August 25 as the time and Sac
ramento the place for holding the State
convention for the nomination of Gov
ernor and other State officers.
The work of apportionment has been
performed with great care in order that
every Assembly district and every urban
and rural subdivision thereof may be
fairly represented. The direction in favor
of the selection of delegates by primary
election is so clear and comprehensive
that local governing bodies cannot mis
take the purpose of the State organiza
tion.
Following is the text of the call recom
mended by the executive committee last
night and, which will probably be adopted
by the general committee to-day:
