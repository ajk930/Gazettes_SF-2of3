RHODE ISLAND.'S CHIEF. EX
ECUTIVE, WHO ORDERED
'OUT THE MILITIA.
VIENNA, June 12.â There was a scene
of wild disorder in the Reichsrath yester
day during the 'debate on the Danube
navigation agreement. Herr Schoenercr,
a leader of the Pan-German party, and
Dr. Wolff, another leader of the same
party, exchanged Insults and finally box
ed each other's ears. It was necessary
for friends of the rival leaders to drag
them apart, amid cheers and jeers from
the galleries.

SCENES OF DISORDER
IN THE REICHSRATH
They will propose two alternatives. OnÂ«
Is to drop the subject and make no fur
ther efforts to secure reciprocity legisla
tion. The other la to accept the rebate
plan. A count of those present and those
absent but known to be in sympathy with
the movement led to the conclusion that
there ore at least nineteen Republican
Senators who can be depended on to
stand together In any course agreed upon.
Counting the full Democratic vote as fa
vorable to the House bill, the beet sugar
advocates concluded that the proposition
to pass that measure unamended would
be the strongest that could be put for
ward. A combination of the two forces
would give a total of fifty-two votes, or
seven more than a majority. S
TWO ALTERNATIVES.
Republican Senators favorable to beet
eugar held a long conference to-day and
decided to continue their opposition to
reciprocity. They will do this by an
nouncing to the advocates of tariff reduc
tion that they will cast their votes for
the reciprocity bill as it passed the House,
including Moore's amendment for the
abolition of the differential duty on refined
sugar, and will resist all amendments
that may be offered to "It.
"Before we vote reciprocity of any kind
with Cuba," paid Senator Bailey. "Demo
crats will wish to know everything about
the campaign that has been waged for
this bill. The minority . has a right to
know how much of the funds of the Cuban
Government has been expended in the
campaign In behalf of this bill, and what
part the Sugar Trust has taken In it I
think it will taJke considerable time to
develop all this."
STAND OF MINORITY.
The most serious result feared by friends
of the administration from the disclosures
made by Senator Teller is its probable ef
fect on the Democrats, who pretend to see
rapidly growing political capital in the in
cident, and who on this account will be
disinclined to give the Republican major
ity "any assistance whatever on reciproc
ity.
The position of the administration is
that expenditures by General Wood were
made by him with full authority, not as
the representative of the United States,
nor as trustee of Cuba, but as actual Gov
ernor of Cuba. General Wood had full
authority to collect funds with which to
run the Government of Cuba, and he had
authority to spend it for any purpose he
deemed proper. He had a perfect ri&ht to
send out documents informing the. Amer
ican public of the economic needs of the
island. It was an expenditure as proper
as the printing and distributing of docu
ments by Congress, they contend.
President Roosevelt and Secretary Root
arrived in the city to-night, and within
ten minutes after the President reached
the White House he was in consultation

lasting late into the night.

CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W., WASHINGTON, June 12.â "Fight
harder than ever" is the war cry of the
administration in the Cuban contest. The
revelations brought out yesterday by Sen
ator Teller that Cuban funds had been
used to disseminate information asÂ«to the
needs of Cuba and that the Suestr Trust
Â¦was using the same medium to advance
reciprocity will only tend to intensify the
efforts of the administration officials, who
are now driven to the last desperate en

OF SAMAR AND DEFENDS SEVERE METHODS OF PACIFICATION
When the turmoil was at its height fully
a dozen shots were fired from the car
through the drawn curtains. One bullet
lodged in the neck of Venncr Peterson,
aged 12, son of John Peterson of this city.
The boy had been carrying dinners and
was returning home when attracted /by
the crowd. The shot struck him when he
was standing some distance from the car.
The shooting made the mob wild, and
only the presence of the troops prevented
the demolition of the car and serious in
jury of the deputies.
Major Sweet, surgeon of the cavalry,
examined the boy, and â¢. pronounced him
fatally hurt. The boy was taken to tha
Emergency Hospital, where it was an
nounced to-night that he Would die.
The wounding of the boy sobered the
crowd, which, after the car had proceed
ed, became more temperate.
At this time a Providence passenger,
Benjamin P. Bosworth, becoming- alarm
ed at the shower of stones, jumped from
the car, which was being rushed through
the mob, and sustained serious/ injuries
by falling.

LITTLE BOY IS SHOT.
STONES ARE THROWN.
The most- serious disturbance to-day
was at the city line. A car was started
from the Pawtucket-avenue carhouse o.i
which were a score of deputy sheriffs. At
Pawtucket and East avenues a big crowd
was in waiting, and It was prepared to
give the deputies a warm reception.
Major Maynard had the First Battalion
of cavalry as a guard to the cars, the
troops being divided by platoons in the
front and rear. The xleputy sheriffs w^ere
ordered to. keep their revolvers in their
pockets by Major Maynard, who said that
if there was to be any shooting the mil
itia .would do it.
.Chief of Police Rice was present and
advised the people to disperse, and, a
number of the striking conductors and
motormen practically endangered their
own safety by endeavoring to prevail on
the people to leave.
Before the people turned their attention
to the car they cheered the troopers. Im
mediately after, however, a rain of
stones, bricks and every conceivable form
of missile fell upon the electric car. The
troopers were hemmed in by. the mob and
with great difficulty succeeded in working
their way out, the motorman of the car
facing the mob and getting his car

rected against the tfmted Traction Com
pany, whose union men have been on
strike since June 2, and the inability of
the limited police force and deputy sher
iffs to suppress rioting induced Governor
Kimball to call out the militia.
Numerous scenes of disorder occurred
during the day and more than a score of
people were Injured, one fatally. In the
presence of about 1000 persons and the
militia this evening Adjutant General
Sackett read the riot act. The city was
taken possession of by the militia. A pro
visional regiment was formed, composed
of companies from the First and Second
regiments, with the First Battalion of
Cavalry. The regiment responded to an
emergency call promulgated by Governor
Kimball, and Brigadier General Herbert
S. Tanner assumed command. In the aft
ernoon orders were issued calling out the
third division of the Naval Reserves and
the machine gun battery.

Consentine, it is alleged, had a long list
of people from whichto select his victims,
including the youngest son of Senator
Clark, Mips Lulu F. Largey, a millionair
ess of Butte, and also a number of lead
ing merchants, bankers and mining men.
When arrested/ Consentine held a ticket

MOB AFTER PRISONER.
WiHlam Welsh, a Deputy Sheriff, has
been arrested charged with the shoot
ing of Peterson. When taking the pris
oner to the police station two policemen
were roughly handled and were followed
to the door of the station by a mob that
stoned the officers and made great efforts
to get the prisoner from them. The man
was searched, and on him was found a
revolver with four charges in it. With
Welsh the police brought Adams Saun
rlers. a private of the Eleventh Heavy
Artillery, U. S. A.. aUFort Adams, home
on furlough, who declares he saw the
Deputy Sheriff lean over a seat and fire
the shot that hit the boy. Welsh main
tains that he did not shoot. The High
Sheriff had given orders to the deputies
not to use their revolvers and not to fire
under any circumstances. Later Welsh
was arraigned before Judge Shove on a
charge of assault with intent to kill. He
pleaded not guilty and was held in $1000
bail for appearance. Because of the ina
bility of the prisoner to furnish, bail and
the unwillingness of the police* to permit
him to be carried through the streets he
remains locked up at police headquarters.
â¢the afternoon, after the militia officers
had jurisdiction over the field and. had
mapped out plans of campaign, and the
proclamation of Governor Kimball had
been . published, was such that General
Tanner determined to have all the sol
diers available. After consultation with
the Governor it was-decided to ask for
all of the available militia, and additional
companies were called out.
On the arrival of these commands there
were 750 men and 60 officers on duty.
After the militia had been stoned in
the morning the ball cartridges were
served out, each private carrying forty
rcunds and each officer fifty rounds of
revolver ammunition.
Louis was released to-day to attend
his brother's funeral, the mourn

of the dead man, wept silently. for a time
and then leaned down and kissed the
brow of the murdered man. As he raised
his head Louis Luciano beckoned him to
come to a rear room.- Ferari. did so and
Louis drew a sawed-off shotgun from his
trouser leg and filled Ferari with buck
shot, causing instant death.' He was ar

brother, -he said, and was willing to hang.
There were two others, and he would

to lead to many deaths. An Italian was

Mountain Is now fairly broken, and work
will soon be under full headway in tha
camp. It has been Impossible for the
mining companies to start until they
could -get In supplies. While many peo
ple Have been going in and out over the
various trails.. there have been no oppor
tunities,, to get large amounts of sup
plies in until now. The main factor in
clearing up the situation is the opening
of what Is known as the Claswell trail.
This lies on the high land between the
middle and south forks of the Salmon,
and therefore free from high water trou
bles. That trail is now open. It is reach
ed by wagon road from Boise.

The weather was ideal for a picnic and
amusement at the pretty little park was
found ih: large quantities. Many campers
in the vicinity- left their tents and joined
the merry-makers, and" few picnic crowds
could have been more congenial.
A band in the pavilion furnished music
for dancing that was continuous on the
day's programme. Athletic events occu
pied the afternoon and all of the athletic
contingent, both old and young, partici
pated. The following is a list of the
events and the winners of each:
pTT"^HE fifteenth, annual picnic of the
I Union Printers' Mutual. Aid So
il ciety was held at Fairfax Park,
â¢â¢'JX Marin County, yesterday. A large
throng of pleasure seekers left the
city shortly after 9 o'clock, and many
more followed on boats that left at noon.
M. Jouares said. he was pledged by the
Government's promise to vigorously en
force the law of associations, but he*re
ftretted that the . powers-of the clergy
were not further- curtailed,' ami hoped
that the reduction.' of- the period of mili
tary service to two; years would be the
first step in the formation of a militia
system. He suggested .that- France Â¦ take
the glorious initiative in disarmament.
The question of Alsace-Lorraine, Â¦ he as
serted, could not stand in the way.:.
The Rightists protested against these
remarks by-M. .Jouares, and there were
repeated interruptions when he, said the
Franco-Russian alliance, on- which the
patriots counted on formerly to support
the French claims to Alsace-Lorraine, had
now become the principal instrument for
the maintenance of the status quo.
M. Jouares concluded amid cheers from
the Socialists by asserting ithat disarma
ment was the best means to secure social
reforms.. Â¦ . - '. .
M. Jaures was followed by M. ; Sembat,
who spoke for the uncompromising So
cialists. He ; attacked the moderation of
the Government and eaid he would vote
against it. - . i. .
Replying to M. Sembat, M. Combes, the
Premier, said that the . recent elections
had shown that the nation approved the
policy of the last Cabinet and desired its
continuation, and that this was the pur
pose of the Government.- After entering
upon details of his policy M. Combes con
cluded by saying that the Cabinet's atti
tude was one of combating nationalism
and clericalism. â¢ . ' ..Â¦'
After listening to a speech by M. RIbot
(Republican), in -.which the speaker dwelt
upon the vagueness of the ministerial
declaration, the Chamber adopted a vote
ot confidence in the Government by 329
votes to 124, worded as follows:
"The Chamber expresses its confidence
in the Government to apply the, policy of
lalcism, fiscal reform and social solidar
ity." Â¦ r. . Â¦ Â¦ -.â¢Â¦.-. : '.. ..â¢ i
The Chamber-then adjourned until next
Monday. ; : â¢ '
M. Jouares in behalf of the Foclallst3
declared they would . collaborate witb~.the
Republican and reform policy.
" The Minister, of Finance, M. Rouvler, in
terposed, saying: "We Intend ' to ' make
economies in all the services." , :
. M: Brussiere urged the Government to
fiimly carry out the Radical programme
and introduce measures tending to the
separation of church and state, | pro
viding for a progressive â¢ income tax and
the partial purchase of the railroads by
the state. ; . -.. Â¦ . â¢
PARIS, June 12.â The Chamber of Dep
uties 'and its galleries were filled to the
utmost this afternoon when the first de
bate under the new Ministry, and one
which was to Indicate precisely its
strength in the- house, opened. M. Brus
slere (Radical) moved-an interpellation of
the general policy of the Government and
said he hoped it wquld show the same
firmness as its predecessors in defending
the republic.
LONDON, June 12.â George Renwick,
Conservative member of Parliament for
Kewcastle-on-Tyne and a ship owner, tes
tifying to-day before the Parliamentary
Subsidies Committee in behalf of the
owners of "tramp" steamships, objected
to the Government subsidizing the great
liners instead of subsidizing cargoes, 'and
eaid the foreign competition which he
mest feared was .the American. The
transfer of British ships to foreigners
was absurdly simple. All ships in * the'
American combination could be trans
ferred to the United States within a quar
ter of an hour and at the cost only of a
few stamps.
Renwick. when asked if he thought the
American ship subsidy bill would be
dropped in consequence of the Morgan
chipping ' combine, replied that, on the
contrary, he had good reason to believe
It would be pressed on.
I do not believe that Morgan made proposi
tions to the French Transatlantic Company,
because he thought it was in such a precarious
condition that It could ' easily be overcome.
Â¦While I doubt his success would be so easy,
Kill I think It necessary to provide for an
eventuality. This ie why I am calling on the
Government to Intervene. The danger from an
economic view point is great, but there is. also
dancer from a military point. All the ships In
the combination will tiy the American flag: and
in rate of war the United States could utilize
them as cruisers and our American colonies,
which are bo ardently coveted by American im
perialism, might be endangered.
M. Etienne dois ;not Intend to question
the Government before a fortnight hence
in order to give, the" Minister of Com
merce sufficient, time' to investigate 1 the
situation. Â¦ * â¢ ,". Â¦ ' .
PARIS, June 12.â M. Etlenne, vice pres
ident of the Chamber of Deputies, was in
terviewed to-day regarding his letter, sent
Tuesday to the Minister of Commerce, M.
Troutllot, on the subject of the American
thlpping combination. He said the com
bination constituted a national peril for
Krance. adding that a similar combina
tion might be formed for the Mediterra
nean. Continuing he said:

, : TACOMA, June 12.â It is now almost
certain that Murderer Underwood will be
captured; it being only a question of
until he is*" starved out. This morning
Sheriff Roney saw the smoke of Ijis camp
fire at daybreak, but by the time he and
his r companions -could reach the fire Un
derwood had disappeared, and -^ only
smoldering coals remained and corned
beef and sardine cans, recently opened.
These cans bore the same labels as those
which Underwood purchased at Fisher's
store at Tokeland a week ago. The loca
tion of the fire w&s but a short distance
from that of the previous night, and not
very far back in the woods. An old over
turned boat was found on the beach yes
terday, where Underwood is supposed to
have spent Monday night. -
Sheriffs Roney and Cudihee have drawn
a cordon around the spot where Under
wcod is supposed to be hiding, and are
playing a waiting game, confident that
he will be forced to come out by starva
tion. The few Indians in that vicinity
are being closely watched, and It is not
believed they are helping Underwood. Un
derwood's supply of provisions purchased
at Tokeland consisted of two cans each
of dried and corned beef, six cans of
sardines, five pounds of crackers, four
pounds â¢ of cookies, five packages of ; to
bacco and one box of matches. ._â¢â¢â¢'Â¦
tain toBa Starved Out.
Washington Murderer Is Almost Cer-
TJNTEBWOOD IS LOCATED.
Sheriff Durgln turned the leadership of
the posse over to Sheriff Cook of Clacka
mas County to-night and returned to Au
rora. Guard Carlson of Walla Walla, in
charge of the bloodhounds, also brought
the dogs In to-night for a rest. Three
companies of militia are guarding Â¦ the
roads. . . ;
While this was happening the other con
vict climbed over the fence at a point 100
yards away. The two fugitives ran rapid
ly to the center of the wheat field ad
joining their hiding place, and proceeded
on their way together. No one attempted
to follow until daylight.
At 7 o'clock this morning the convicts
appeared at the farmhouse of A. Akers,
five miles north of Gervais, and demanded
breakfast. The men had all gone to work
and only Mrs. Akers and her daughter
were in the house when the bandits
walked up. They made no effort to con
cealtheir identity and Tracy said: "I sup
l>ose"you know who we are?" and without
waiting for a reply said; "We are the
convicts who broke out of the peniten
â¢Mrs. Akers and her daughter prepa'red a
good meal for the outlaws, who had their
guns across their knees while eating. Mrs.
Akers asked them to lay down their guns
while they were eating, but Tracy said he
preferred to keep his weapon near him,
but assured Mrs. Akers that he would not
harm her. After finishing breakfast they
started north. ' /
Mrs. Akers telephoned to Sheriff Durbin
at Gervais that the fugitives had taken
breakfast at her house and that Tracy ap
peared to be wounded Un the right arm-
Sheriff Durbin immediately prepared -to
follow the y trail and ; with a posse and
bloodhounds arrived aV Monitor postoffice,
near the Akers" farm; about 9 o'clock: â¢ *
At 12:30 o'clock this afternoon the fugi
tives lunched at a farmhouse near Needy
and there they secured six pounds of ba
con and a frying. pan, which they took
with them.
The Sheriff of Clackamas County to-day
organized a posse and joined in the hunt.
Company A, Oregon National Guard, of
Oregon City, was ordered out late this aft
ernoon by Governor Geer to take up tho
chase after the fugitives. They have been
tracked all day by the posse and this
evening it Is supposed they-are in the
thick woods on Deep Creek, about seven
miles from Woodburn, and close to the
border between Marion and Clackamas
counties.
At 2 o'clock this morning Charles. Tun,
one of the guaras, decided to move back
to a more commanding | position tit ty
yards away. He had scarcely, taken up
his new station when one of the convicts
ciimbed over the fence at the exact spot
Tuh had left. Tuh was armed with a
shotgun;'- loaded with buckshot. He tired
at the outlaw four times, without effect.
Their daring deeds have terrorized the
inhabitants or the country through which
they have passed and every demand of
the outlaws is complied with by the ter
ror-stricken farmers. They have eaten
at least two meals a day since their flight
began and i upon entering a farmhouse
tiity boldly announce that' they are the
fugitive convicts. :
Last night the fugitives were sur
rounded in a stretch of woods and Sheriff
Durbin. leader of the posse, believed that
there was no chance of escape, the pick
ets being only 105 yards apart, but the
wily convicts broke through the line in
the darkness of the early morning.

General Miles' remarks were those of
an older to younger officers and referred
almost wholly to the business of war.
He said there were supreme moments in
the life of a soldier, one when an officer
knows he doing just what the enemy
thinks he is not, and when he feels one
more victory has been added to American
glory. General Miles was loudly cheered
and applauded when he arose to speak.
The audience, comprising ladles in fash
ionable summer costumes and the entire
cadet corps and several hundred visitors
occupied chairs on the lawn' under the
trees, and the clear sky and beautiful
scenery about West Point gave the exer T

and among the enlisted men from Manila
were 298 United States marines. There
were forty-six passengers in the cabin,
and in the steerage 1015. Fine weather
was encountered all the way across and
the trip was uneventful.
Thirty-five members of Company I of
the famous Ninth Infantry were among
the homecoming warriors.
F. J. Barrow, ex-captain In the quar
termaster's department, was one of three
military prisoners on the transport. Bar

Under the chaperbnage of the officers
and members of Islam Temple, five hun^
dred of the visiting Mystic Shriners made
a pilgrimage yesterday morning to the
Cliff House, the ocean beach and Golden
Gate Park. Although the' morning was
rather gloomy and an immense fog bank
overhung the ocean ' and obscured the
beauties of the Golden Gate, the Nobles
and their ladies had an enjoyable time
and were delighted with what they saw.
After almost a. .week; of -continual festiv
lies, a trip through the bracing air to the
ocean proved a very refreshing diversion.
The caravan started from the Palace
Hotel at 10 o'clock. It was under the su
pervision, of Noble Thomas Morton, treas
urer of Islam Temple, and he proved him
self an' able, chaperon. The cavalcade
wended its '< way through many of the
principal . strets of the city, affording the
visitors- an oportunity to view some of
the stately mansions en route. Â¦ â¢
When the caravan reached the Cliff
House the visitors passed a pleasant hour
in walking along the sea shore or in vis
iting Sutro Baths, where are the remains
of old Ben Butler, the leviathan who used
to rule supreme over . the - seals at Seal
Rock. Most of the visitors had never be
fore seen a seal, and the Immense size of
Old Ben somewhat astonished them.
At the Cliff House Islam Temple had

Al Malaikah, all with the regulation num

Ctsnpeio for the prizes. The teams
marched past the grand stand into the
Letting ring, where they awaited their
turn to drill. The four competing teams
and the two which gave exhibition drills
were made up as follows:
Al Malaikah of Los Angeles also gave
an exhibition drill but owing to the lack
of a proper number in the team it was
debarred from the contest for prizes. The
men of this team are of regular stature
and they presented a magnificent appear
ance. Their work was excellent and was
cheered to the echo, the members -of other
teams joining In. the chorus with a hearty
jrood will. . . ,
The team gave an exhibition drill, how
ever, which fairly captured the crowd.
It was limited to fifteen minutes while
the other teams were given a half-hour.
The team was about to give its famous
red-umbrella drill when the bell rang, and
great disappointment was expressed there-*
at. Zuhrah captured the honors at the
competition at Kansas City last year, and
the inability of the team to compete here
has proved a bitter pill for the members
to swallow when, â¢ according to their own
statements, they were not previously in
formed that a. specified number of men
â¢would be required in the team in order
to compete for a prize.
TEAMS DO GOOD WOEK
While the drill was announced to be
competitive it was not so in any sense.
No regulation drill or rules governing the
same had been agTeed upon so that each
team executed its own' moves at its own
sweet will. Each team was judged upon
its merits, but two of the patrols, were
barred from competing for prizes because
they had not the regulation number of
men. In this way the Zuhrah team from
Slinneapolis, which is a crack organiza
tion with many victories to its credit,
Â¦was barred from the competition because
it had only sixteen men when twenty-one
\ias the minimum number required.

holder's home run with three on. bases
was the feature of a rather slow game at
Chutes Park to-day. Cutter was , very
wild and in addition "to being hit rather
freely, he passed four men to first to keep
himself in trouble most of the time. Mc

. Joe Millett, the amateur champion
heavy-weight boxer, stopped Fred Stan

night at the San Francisco Athletic Club.
The bout was a fast one while it lasted,
each landing many stiff punches.
"Soldier" John Walton failed to appear
to box Jack Joyce. The club officials sub
stituted Bflly McDonald and Jim Le Roy
of Yolo. Â¦ Le Roy looked like ,Walcott," but
did not fight like the "Barbadoes Won
der." 1 Le Roy was too slow and ungainly.
He lost on a foul to McDonald.
Jim Kane was given the decision over
"Bob" Thompson, but did not deserve it.
A draw was the worst Thompson - de
served.- Jack Co rdell was too big and
strong for Chick Callaghan. The latter's
seconds " saved him unnecessary punish

It was baseball of high quality whicjÂ»
the talent had to pass out yesterday at
Recreation grounds. The offering com
prised the stern stuff of many basehits
and the sterner stuff of numerous errors.
This put many men across the rubber and
kept the score hopping from one side to
the other with the grace of a full-fledged
lightning change " artist. The champs
finally settled down and played the game
in keeping with their reputation, winning
by 6 to -5. " â¢
The Ponies could not hit hard,, but er
rors aided 'when safe bumps were lack
ing. They had the game well to tMe good
until the fifth when Lohman gave the
high sign and Oakland, at once proceeded
to bat in four runs. The Ponies went
them one better in the seventh when
three came home on a combination of
errors and a single by Holly. It was tied
by the champions right away and one in
the eighth, on Schmidt's double and an
other by Lohman, endedthe trouble. â¢
Meredith was batted hard j and was re
placed by Glendon In' the seventh. Josh
Reilly :made. a phenomenal stop and a

off day at second. McCreedie and Holly
were the main guys with the tree, each
knocking out three safe ones. The score:

On the isolated cases referred to, he
said, the treatment was not consistent
with humanity and the laws of war. He
then related from hearsay the story of
the administration of the water cure to
the vice presidentÂ© of San Miguel, and
a native policeman, who described one
occasion where he had assisted in "wa
ter-curing" a native. The man's mouth,
he said, was forced open with 'a stick
and the water poured down his throat.
He said the Filipinos regarded the
kindness of the troops toward them as a
Â¦weakness, and became bold in conse
quence; also that the general under
standing in the army was that the
policy of General Hughes waa one
of humanity and kindness. He took is
sue with Senator Oulbertson on the sub
ject of burning villages, and declared it
to be a. military necessity.

WASHINGTON, June 12. â The
House to-day adopted an
important rule for the con
sideration of the Irrigation
bill, which passed the Senate
some time ago, and devoted the day to
general debate of the measure. To-mor
row the bill will be read for amendment
under the five-minute rule. Mohdell of
Wyoming, Tongue of Oregon. Terrell of
Massachusetts and Shallenberger of Ne
braska spoke to-day in favor of the bilL
Ray, chairman of the Judiciary Commit
tee, made a long legal argument against
it. Olmstead of Pennsylvania enlivened
the proceedings with a humorous speech
In reply to Cushman's attack on the Com
mittee on Rules.
Earlier in the day Robinson of Indiana
opposed the adoption of the rule for the
consideration of the irrigation bill. He
declared that the bill would be beneficial
to the arid land States and danger
ous to all others. He criticized the action
of the Democratic Congressional Com
mittee in adopting a resolution favoring
the Irrigation- bill. He declared that the
committee was without Jurisdiction, and
had no power to bind Democratic mem
bers. The whole scheme was undemo
cratic, he asserted, and was in the inter
est of land-grant railways.
Underwood of Alabama favored tlie
adoption of the rule. He argued that the
only method of building up the arid land
States was to provide for their irrigation.
The bill would not take a dollar out of
the treasury, he said. It would only use
the proceeds from the sale of lands In
each State for the benefit of such State.
Ehafroth of Colorado also argued for
the adoption of the rule.
Newlands of Nevada also supported the
rule. The resolution was then adopted
without division.
DATES FIXED FOR
TOURNAMENT
At a meeting of San Francisco Fly
casting Club last night, which assumed
the form of a dinner, dates were an
nounced for the International tournament
to be held at Stow Lake, Golden Gate
Park.
August Sth and 9th were the days se
lected. The tournament is expected to at
tract many members, of Eastern angling
clubs. The programme at the present
time includes six events. These consist
of long distance casting with rods less
than five ounces In weight; long distance
casting with heavy rods, accuracy; ac
curacy and delicacy; lure casting- 'with
half-ounce rubber frog and team casting.
The trophy in the latter event will be
a silver loving cup. This will become the
property of the club whose team wins it.
In the other events there will be diamond
championship medals and merchandise
prizes of value.
While the representative men of the
gentle pastime are here it is purposed to
lorm a national organization. They will
also be taken on some stream where they
can enjoy good angling.
The tournament will b# the most ambi
tious of its kind ever held in the world.
Grover Cleveland was elected the first
honorary member of the club at its last
meeting. President Roosevelt found it
necessary to decline a similar honor owlnar
to his official position. Ex-President
Cleveland's letter of acceptance reads:

Edward J. Norton of Los Angeles, late
private in Company L, Eighteenth
United States Infantry, was the witness
at the afternoon session. He served
two years in the Philippine Islands army.
Answering: questions by Senator Culbert
son Norton stated that except in isolated
Evans said he had been present at
the burning of four or nve native vil
lages, and that the destruction of these
places had been due to the presence of
insurgents. The orders were to destroy
all the native huts along the coast near
the mountains for ten miles in Batan
province, so as to force the natives : to
come in, and this, he said, was done. !
Replying to '"questions by Senator Bev
eridge the witness said the orders to
troops were to treat the natives hu- 1
manely, and with the exceptions noted
their treatment had been in accord with
these instructions. The natives had not,
on the other hand, shown any apprecia
tion of this consideration. They refused
to divulge information In their posses
sion, and in many cases they subjected
the American troops to indignities. ' In
one case, he said, where two soldiers
were killed, their ears were cut off.
Mark H. Evans of Des Moines, Iowa,
formerly a sergeant of Company. F.
Thirty-second Volunteer Infantry, to-day
testified before the Senate Committee on
the Philippines concerning the adminis
tration of the water cure to Filipinos on
four different occasions during his ser
vice In the islands. He also related the
particulars of the burning of several na
tive villages. He was questioned by Sen
ators Patterson, Beveridge and McOomas.
All these events occurred, the witness
said, during the year 1900 in the province
of Batangas, island of Luzon, and in or
near the town of Orano, where his head
quarters were. Three of the cases of
water cure occurred outside the town. In
one case the cure was administered by
native scouts, and in the other by an
American soldier. The first case occurred
at a little town where there were sup
posed to be some insurgents. The scouts
picked out the suspected people, and tak
ing one of them to a nearby creek,
poured a quantity' of water into his
mouth from a canteen. The purpose in
this as in other cases was to secure a
confession. On another occasion during
an expedition to neighboring islands, the
witness said that he had an American
soldier take two suspected natives into
the water and dutlt them, holding them
under for perhaps half a minute at a
time. He secured a confession as to the
hiding of guns In one case, but none in
the other.

A CLOSE GAME
A lady who saw Miss Batley this morn
ing says she acted queerly when talking
with her. j The dead girl's father, E. L.
Bailey; who resides at Redding, has been
advised of his daughter's awful end,, and
his instructions are being awaited. " The
Coroner was notified: immediately, and is
expected here to-morrow.
It is undoubtedly a case of suicide, and
iSiOne of the most horrible deeds of self
destruction that has occurred here in
many a day. Thd unfortunate girl was
at one time an Inmate of the Napa In
sane Asylum, but the King family noted
no peculiar actions by hereof late, nor
had she seemed melancholy.
King stated that she has been visiting
his mother, Mrs. C. J. King, at Clare
mont, for some months, and had not been
seen since luncheon, but no especial anx
iety was felt until 6 o'clock to-night.
When King commenced inquiries and
heard at the Claremont store that - the
burned body of a girl had been discovered
north of the village, he immediately con
nected this clew with the disappearance
of his cousin, and his fears proved only
too true. - . . â¢
Collins and Ker Â¦ immediately drove to
Claremont and telephoned an undertaker,
who brought the remains here, where they
remained unidentified until 7 o'clock, when
Herbert B. King, a student of Pomona
College, positively, identified the dead girl
as hia cousin, Miss Bailey, 22 years ola,
whose home is at Redding.
The- body was lying face downward.
A blue jockey, cap and a pair of , gold
rimmed glasses were lying near by. About
fifty feet away was a pail which had con
tained kerosene and spme matches." . From
this spot a burned trail could be traced
to where,-- the -body.: lay, showing that the
girl had evidently applied , a match to
her oil-saturated garments and then ran
aflame through the â¢ chaparral.

The latest crea tion in New York is velvet vests as I
we here picture. They come in black and navy blue I

It is said that Webster Davis has decided to leave
Kansas City. because some of the people said unkind
things about him, and it is therefore fair, to assume
he is going to locate in some place where no one
ever heard of him.

There has not been a single measure before this
Congress on which the vote of either House was
divided by strict party lines, and it is either an*era
of good feeling or else there is a whole lot' of con
fusion in the minds of statesmen.
Â¦ > . ...
Whitelaw Reid may be posing. as the representa
tive of the United States at the coronation, but. J.
Pierpont Morgan seems to be cutting most ice with
the King. At the Choate banquet to his Majesty
Morgan was very nearly the whole thing.
The seals themselves seem to be doomed. They
will doubtless be ended long before the controversy
which has been started over them^ The report sub
mitted to Congress sets forth that the extermination
of the herd goes on rapidly, and avers that by the
wholesale slaughter of the mother seals thousands
of the young die of starvation. It costs the United
States a large sum every year to patrol the sea, and
since the patrol is not sufficient to protect the herds
the conclusion is drawn that it would be best to end
the matter by killing all the fur seals found on the
Pribyloff Islands with the exception of 1000 males
Possibly the controversy may give some employ
ment to the High Court of Nations, which (has been
idle ever since it was created. The United States,
Great Britain and Russia are too big to fight
over a few seals, and they would make a fine show
as petitioners before a court of arbitration.
There was a time, only a few years ago, when the
seal question loomed up big in the domain of inter
national politics, and the discussion of it brought
forth words, that portended war. By one means or
another the issue was evaded by diplomatists until
new issues arose to distract public attention. The
war with Spain, the war in South Africa and the
invasion of China by the powers have intervened
since' the old days of the excited Bering Sea' dis
pute, and most Americans had . forgotten all about
it or thought'it satisfactorily adjusted. It comes up
now like a ghost of the past, but it is not a ghost. . . It
is a real live question and has been alive all these
years.
RECENTLY the Ways and Means Committee
of the House of Representatives reported
favorably a bill which virtually authorizes the
killing of all seals in Alaskan waters provided no
satisfactory arrangement can be made with Great
Britain for their protection. â¢ Since the submission
of that report it is announced that Assistant Secre
tary of State Pierce will soon sail for Europe to
present at The Hague the case of the United States
in the controversy with Russia over the seal fish
eries.
THE SEAL FISHERIES.
The disclosure that General Wood, an officer of
the United States, was using money belonging to the
Cuban Government to subsidize the New York Ex
port Association to boom the Cuban reciprocity bill
shows a curious complication of men, money and
measures. There may have been nothing wrong in
the action, but it certainly was a freak.
When; the time comes to deport the
woman the order of the Collector will
be served" on the steamship company,
and, should the 'company interpret
Judge De Haven's order as an order of
deportation and refuse to allow the wo<
n3an her liberty, a new writ of habeas
corpus will be applied, for.
The counsel 1 raised the point that In a
habeas corpus proceeding the- court could
do only one , of two thingsâ remand the
petitioner to the custody whence taken,
or discharge the. petitioner from custody.
Judge de Haven intimated that it was
his opinion that the order he made
could be construed as a remand only, and
refused to modify the order.
In order to gain time her counsel,
George A. MacGowan, obtained a writ
of habeas corpus from United States Dis
trict Judge de. Haven* on the ground
that she was a native born citizen, of
the United States. Judge de Haven de
cided that she and her witnesses were
liars, and ordered' her remanded to the
custody of the steamship company that
brought her to this port. In the mean
time the woman's husband arrived in San
Francisco, and, the -fact being brought
to the attention of the Collector, a re
port was sent to the Secretary of the
Treasury,, who replied yesterday, in
structing the Collector to land the wo
man, she having proved that a common
law marriage existed between her and
the merchant. Mr. MacGowan went be
fore the United States District Court
yesterday and asked Judge de Haven
to' modify- his order of remand so that
the woman might be placed in the cus
tody whence she had been taken, with
out any reference to deportation.
She arrived at this port from Hong
kong last September, claiming admission
as the wife of a merchant regularly dom
iciled here. Her husband had returned
to China for the purpose of bringing her
to this country, but he was taken sick
there and sent his wife on ahead of him.
Before 'the Chinese Bureau she swore
that she was a native of China and the
wife of a merchant, entitled to be and re
main in the United States. The Coll ac
tor denied her a landing on the ground
that the intention of the law was to
enable the wife and minor children of
a domiciled merchant to join him here.
Her husband, not being in the United
States, the Collector decided that she
could not avail herself of the statute.
The Secretary of the Treasury^ notified
Customs Collector Stratton yesterday
that Chin. Tai should be allowed to land.
But because of certain legal complica
tions Chin Tai must remain at the deten
tion shed for some time yet.
The fight is interesting, but at the same time it
grows wearisome. Fifty years is a long enough time
to stand round discussing an enterprise. More years
of delay would be annoying. The people have no
prejudices in favor of or against any route. . They
wish the canal. It is therefore to be hoped that on
Thursday the vote will be decisive one way or the
other, and that when the Republican party goes be
fore the country this fall it can. point with pride to
the fulfillment of the pledge to provide for an isth
fciian canal under the control of the United States.
The report goes on to say: "The Senate con
tains eighty-eight members, of whom fifty-five may
be classed as Republicans and thirty-three Demo
crats. The Nicaragua route has to a considerable
extent been made a Democratic issue, so that its
friends are assured of nearly solid . party support,
while on the Republican side there is a considerable
division of forces. Hawley of Connecticut and Platt
of New York, both members of the Senate commit
tee, are Nicaraguanists, and while there are personal ,
circumstances in each case which seriously detract '
from the value of this judgment, their votes count.
Mitchell of Oregon is for the Nicaragua route, and
there will be some scattering support throughout
the Republican ranks for it. The decision, then, de-.
pends on whether the Republican minority, added to
nearly the entire Democratic strength, will be large
enough to, carry, the. day." .
A recent report from Washington in reviewing the
situation says the advocates of Nicaragua are by
no means so sanguine as they were before the vol
canic nature of the land along that route became the
subject of special interest. On the other hand it is
asserted that some of the supporters claimed for the
Panama route may be won over for Nicaragua be
fore the vote is taken. If the Nicaragua men can
get a majority to vote for the bill as it came from
the House their victory is won, for it is not likely the
President would veto it. Should the Panama men
win in the Senate, however, they would have an
other battle to fight in the House, so Nicaragua has
a big advantage in the contest.
The Nicaraguan bill now before the Senate was
passed by the House almost unanimously. At that
time, however, the Panama company had not made
an acceptable offer of the sale of its rights in Pan
ama. Consequently the situation then was not the
same that it is now, and it would be unfair to assume
that the House will insist upon Nicaragua or noth
ing. There are, in fact, good reasons for hoping that
the two houses will be able to agree, no matter
which route be chosen.
It is to be hoped that the vote taken on Thursday
will be decisive. The project of an isthmian canal
has been under consideration for fifty years. The
various routes have been examined again and again.
Report after report has been made upon them. All
the facts obtainable by the science of the -day are
known to Congress. Nothing remains but to strike
the balance between the opposing arguments and
decide what is to be done. It is a case in which any
action is better than no action. The growing good
of the country requires a short waterway between
our Atlantic and our Pacific coasts. The people
have repeatedly declared themselves in favor of the
immediate construction of such a waterway, and
this Congress is expected to provide for it.
ACCORDING to a programme agreed upon
the Senate will vote upon the Nicaragua
canal bill and all pending amendments next
Thursday. Neither side is confident of success. It
is known that since the volcanic eruption at Mar
tinique several of the supporters of Nicaragua have
gone over to the Panama side, but whether the
number will be large enough to carry the Panama
bill is by no means certain.
THE . CANAL BILL.
CHIN TAI MUST
STILL REMAIN
IN DETENTION
HKNRI MAURICE CANNON, known
throughout the world as the heav
est of all men, died suddenly from
heart disease at his saloon, Mar
. ket street, between Eighth and
Ninth, - yesterday morning at 4 o'clock.
Cannon had been ailing for a few days,
and on Wednesday afternoon retired to
his room at the back of his place of busi
ness.
At 3 o'clock yesterday morning his bar
tender handed him the cash returns, and
he was then able to discuss th*e business
of the night. Although ill, his death was
not expected.
Deceased weighed 613 pounds. A native
of Zurich, he was deemed there one of
the foremost athletes, and as a, wrestler
met many men in the arena. It was not
until ten years ago that he commenced
to grow to abnormal proportions, his
weight Increasing with alarming rapidity.
With it all Cannon remained- good-na
tured, and a bohemian life Was his choice.
For the purpose of mitigating the evil as far as
possible the Government has remitted the rent due
by lesseÂ«s of crown lands and the Government rail
ways are moving stock from the barren districts at
one-half the ordinary rates. Rains are due in Aus
tralia at this season of the year, but it is said the
meteorologists do not expect them to be sufficiently
abundant to save the situation. Fortunately, Aus
tralia has but a scanty population, and while the loss
of property will 'be heavy the mortality will not be
great.
Following the lack of water there comes of course
the inevitable lack of food. Forage is scarce and
can be obtained only at enormous prices. To make
the matter worse the newly organized Federal Gov
ernment has imposed a customs duty on the importa
tion of fodder, Â°nd accordingly it cannot be brought
in from New Zealand at rates cheap enough to afford
relief. One of the larger cattlemen of the country
is reported to have been paying $1500 a day for food
for his stock. A good many are mixing straw with
treacle to make it- palatable and are feeding their
stock on the mixture.
One report says: "Mr. McCaughey, Australia's
sheep king, removed a million stock some months''
ago from the vicinity of Bourke to the Riverina;
less wealthy owners are driving their flocks. The
droves leave broad, close-cropped tracks, reminiscent
of the work of a gigantic scythe. The routes are
strewn with skeletons of sheep. A natural reservoir
of fifty square, yards in this district is surrounded by
heaps of bones, and the sheep7 which were too weak
to depart after drinking the water, dropped dead.
Overhead the crows and hawks are screeching threat
eningly in a sky of burnished blue. The scene is
weird and characteristic. In portions of Western
Queensland the four-year-old cattle, have never had
wet skins. A common method of "treating exhausted
horses is to slit the palate with a knife, the- animal's
own blood is swallowed, and this acts in a reviving
manner."
So^erious is the situation that British papers are
giving an unusually large amount of space to reports
from the country. The Sydney correspondent of the
London Mail estimates that within the seven dry
years the loss in livestock alone amounts to upward
of $75,000,000. Men thrown out of employment on
the stricken ranges are thronging the cities, where
no work is found for them, and the state govern
ments have been compelled to provide means for
their relief. The only sections in the whole of the
vast country that have escaped the drought are the
northern rivers district of New South Wales and por
tions of Riverina.*
â¢ The Westminster Gazette in commenting upon the
reports from the various drought-stricken sections
says: "It is the old familiar story, only worse;
sheep, rabbits and other animals dying by thousands,
and the rivers dried up. 'And once more there is the
agitation for the colonial government to help in the
construction of more huge reservoirs and for the
extension of the employment of deep, artesian wells.-' In
Queensland they have to sink to an enormous depth,
and the water, when it gushes up, is unbearably, hot;
the cost of boring is almost five shillings a foot, and
several of the sinkings are considerably over a mile.
Nevertheless the money 1 expended has proved a valu
able investment." . .
ADVICES from Australia are to the effect that*
the seven dry years which have so distressed
the people have culminated in a drought that
amounts to a veritable disaster. The losses have
been enormous, and there is danger they will be

THE AUSTRALIAN DROUGHT.
The chief interest excited by the , selectidn 'of
Michael Henry Herbert as Embassador"~to the
United States seems to be that he married a sister
of Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt. The appointment
gives that ambitious young matron a new prestige in
society, and it is believed the other Vanderbilts will
have either to do kowtow to her or get out of the
country.

Democracy, then, is going before 'the people not
to tell them what shall be done for the good of the
country, but to find fault with the administration.
Upon not a single issue of the time has that party
or any of its leaders even so much as a helpful sug
gestion to offer. All the great plans for raising an
issue in Congress have dissolved into thin air. The
question before the country, then, is whether sup
port shall be given to a party which has established
prosperity, or to one which "views with alarm"
every action taken to provide it. Oregon has al
ready spoken on that issue, and there is no reason
to doubt that the rest of the Union will speak in the
same assured voice and return a Republican major
ity to the next House.
It seems, then, that we are" to have another cam
paign in which the opposition party will content
itself with denouncing, condemning, denying and
declaring "unconstitutional" about everything the
administration has done. To a people made prosper
ous by protection they will denounce the Dingley
tariff. In the face of financial stability established
by the gold standard they will deny that Republican
legislation has been beneficial. Heedless of the
heroism of the army they will condemn the action
of our troops in the field as if they were bands of
marauders or buccaneers. In short; they will avow'
an antagonism to everything that has been done,
but will make no declaration of an affirmative policy
upon any issue whatever.
Even the most ardent Democrats must admit that
their party has no policy to submit to % the voters
this year. 'Â¦ Senator Gorman is reported to have told
the leaders in Congress that they could not make a
campaign on the "water cure" or win votes by at
tacking the army. Most Democrats doubtless agree
with him, but unfortunately they have no other is
sue to offer. State platforms adopted by Demo
cratic conventions thus far in the campaign have
been, notable only for what they have left unsaid.
They contain no reference to Bryan or to free sil
ver. They have ripped away the old planks of the
platform, but they "have put nothing in their places.
but would take the aggressive, as usual, and submit
the question to the people as an affirmative policy,
while the Democrats would be able to offer, nothing
but negation aad denunciation. He is quoted as
saying; "There will not be any need of the Demo-'
crats forcing the issue. As I said before, we wel
come it, and are. prepared to go before the Ameri
can people and let them decide it. In the State of
Oregon the Philippine policy was an issue in the
Congressional, elections^ and the result was that the
two Republicans elected were given a larger major
ity than their predecessors ever received. Congress
man-elect Tongue made this question the specific
issue, and distributed thousand's of copies of the
speech which I delivered in the Senate throughout
his district. I am confident that wherever this issue
is raised and properly presented, which will be the
case so far as our side is concerned, the result will
be the same, if not more pronounced than it was in
Oregon."
Senator Lodge, who has recently been on a visit
to his home, stated to a representative of the Bos
ton Herald that the Republican party would not wait
for Democrats to make an issue of the Philippines,
The change in the estimates' of the result of the
campaign is due to the failure of the Democratic
leaders to formulate an issue which, will have any
support from the independent vote. It was believed
that the cry of anti-imperialism would win over a
large number of voters who supported > McKinley
two years ago, but the Oregon election has shown
the vanity of such expectations.. In the Congres
sional districts in that State the Philippine question
was made .the chief issue of the fight, and so far
from losing anything by it the Republicans elected
their candidates/ by larger pluralities than before.
That fact, taken in connection with the defeat of the
Republican candidate for Governor, shows that how
ever divided Republicans may be on local issues they
are united on those of the nation.
DURING the past winter and early spring the
Democratic leaders were quite sanguine of
carrying the House of Representatives at the
fall elections. Of late, however, their hopes, have
begun to fade, and it is now stated. that political ex
perts at Washington predict, a' sweeping Republican
yictory.
OLD EXCHANGE
BUILDING'S FATE
IN THE BALANCE
There is a great stir among the mining
', share brokers of the city. This is due to
the fact that only two more business
days will pass before the final solution of
the fate of . the Stock Exchange building
in Pine street will be put to the test o*
votes. On Monday forenoon next the pres
ent owners of the property In Pins street
will meet in their business home to decide
1 whether they will accept an offer of $300,
000 for the exchange building or reject it.
Opinion is not unanimous on the subject,
and the deal for the property Is the themo
of continual discussion whenever brokers
meet who own seats In the exchange.
The fact that the offer of $300,000 haa
been made was mentioned some time ago.
It has taken some weeks to make the
preliminary moves leading "up to the vot
ing on this important question. The pur
pose of the exchange to sell had to be ad
vertised. The general public will ba
greatly Interested. Business in mining
shares has not been lively for a long
time, but there is the glamor of romance
about the exchange building still. While
the great mining excitements of years
ago took place in the old building on
California street, there have been days in
the newer building in which Interest was
at fever height. The deal in Consolidated
California and Virginia of a few years
ago, when the stock ran from 23 cents s*
share to $65 per share In a very short,
time, is still remembered. Business be
came so much mixed that the exchange
shut down pending an adjustment among
the brokers, several of whom failed al
most simultaneously. - .
What the exchange brokers -will do for
quarters if they decide to sell their pres
ent structure is not determined. The sup
position is that if the sale is authorized
there will be a period of two months or
so before the deal could be finally closed
up, and that would allow time for select
ing a new location for the board meet
ings. i

not encouraging, for the report says that, the seal

Frank Kelly, a union stevedore residing at
4U Shipley street, was attacked yesterday
morning and brutally beaten by Pat Fleming,
a non-union marine fireman, and Peter and
Jack Sheehan, union stevedores. Kelly was
knocked down and kicked on the face and
stomach. The beating was administered in the
vicinity of the PaciHc Mail dock and ha? at
tracted considerable attention owing to the
esteem In which Kelly is held by his fellows.
Tihe excuse elven by Fleming for the attack
was that Kelly had "scabbed" during the
strike. This is denied by members of the
Longshoremen's Union, to which Kelly belongs.
Charges may be preferred against Special Po
liceman Fitzserald for not interfering when
the three men had Kelly on the. ground and
were kicking him. Fitzgerald, who was in the
immediate vicinity, was notified of the occur
rence and could, it is said, have saved Kelly
tome of the serious Injury he sustained. Fitz
gerald, however, hurried away from the scene
of conflict. Kelly's Injuries were treated by

to his home and is said to be in a serious con

There was little in the stock market to-day
beyond the settlement and some forced liquida
tion in Kaffirs early In the session, but the
close was good on Jewish and Continental sup
port. Consols touched 97 on Paris buying.
Americans were fairly steady. There was a
little animation In the morning, but- New York
came dull, chiefly 'in Atchison and'Union Pa
cific.
The market has borrowed Â£3,000,000,. mainly

CANNED TOMATOESâ Are strong for snot
stock,, the price being about $105 for 2%
pound standard. Future prices are not yet
named, canners awaiting the outcome of the
crop; a few contracts, are being made by out
siders at 75 cents.
TEAâ Teas In Japan are still higher, tha
price being now about 4 cents above the cor
responding time last year. Supplies are lighter
than usual, and the quality inferior. The flr3t
crop is reported about 40 per cent short. Re
ceipts here are lighter than was expected and
prices have been marked up 2 cents per pound
while another advance will probably occur be
fore the month is over.
CANNED SALMONâ Red, Alaska and sock
eye tails' are practically sold put of first hands,
and the stock In second hands is comparatively
light and not likely tp last much longer at the
present rate of consumption. It is estimated in
a circular letter of the Pacific Selling Company
that the pack on Puget Sound and British Co
lumbia will be 1,600.000. or about 1,000 000
cases less than was turned out last year. The
run on the Columbia River, has improved and
the Dack has reached about the same propor
tions as at the. corresponding period last year'
Mail advices from London state that the
market holds firm with business moderate
and prices tending upward.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
"The monetary situation need cause no
anxiety. Sharp changes in the loan account
seem possible, owing to syndicate operations,
but barring the temporary scarcity that prepa
rations for July disbursements may cause the
outlook is for a comfortable money market
â¢with funds, however, pretty well employed
â¢until crop demands assert themselves. A good
cotton crop, be It remembered, would have a
favorable effect on the foreign exchange mar
ket in the autumn. In case of an early settle
ment of the coal strike the market would
probably display general improvement. The In
crease in Northwest's dividend is a very con
vincing demonstration of railroad prosperity,
but as a bull argument It has been more than
discounted."
The New York circular of Henry Clews says
"The general market at the moment is
largely dominated by the coal strike. This is
pufficicnt to counteract all other favorable in
fluences. Trading is limited and entirely of a
professional character. The public is still out
of the market, awaiting fresh attractions.
Meanwhile, stocks are well held and a confi
dent undertone prevails among Insiders in
spite of occasional recessions. The distant fu
ture depends upon the crop situation more
largely than usual. A repetition of last year's
failures in corn, cotton and feed crops would
be followed by very disagreeable consequences.
Such a series of losses in two* .consecutive
j-ears seems impossible, and fortunately the
fresent outlook is eminently reassuring. The
wheat crop is doing well; a larger acreage of
corn is practically assured, and the fine condi
tion of cotton promises a much larger yield
than last year, when Texas, the banner State,
lost about one-third of her crop. Neverthe
less, it is too early to act with assurance on
the crops. Last year's damage, it will be re
membered, occurred in July.
Trade Prospects.
lapsed to-day Into a torpid condition and deal
ings fell oft about one-third from yesterday's
aggregate. The efforts which were conspicuous
yesterday to advance prices, and which were
still in evidence in the early market to-day,
were discontinued in face of the discouraging
reception which they met. and prices wera
allowed to fall back. There was no actual
weakness developed, and the selling was pretty
well absorbed. In Reading . especially, .in
which there were large offerings, there was
ready absorption and apparently a determina
tion to support the stock. The conspicuous
position of Missouri Pacific was enhanced to
day, and the volume of the dealings in that
stock were far in excess of tiiose in any other
on the list. It was moved upward a point at
one time, followed by Texas and Pacific, but th*
advance met such heavy selling orders that
the movement for the advance was abandoned
and practically all the gain was lost. The
only development to account- for the strength
of the stock was the continued rumors that
the dividend will shortly be increased. The
reaction â¢ In the market was largely due to a
better appreciation of the decrease' in the com
ing wheat crop estimate involved in the fall
ing off in the spring wheat acreage. The trans
fer of Nebraska from spring wheat to the
winter wheat list involves the deduction bf
most of its acreage from the spring wheat
estimate. The revision in the coming wheat
crop estimate thus involved caused persistent
strength in the wheat market. The strength
of the corn market was said to be in sympa
thy with wheat, but it had even more signifi
cant influence on the stock market, owing to
the vast importance attached to the fate of
the coming crop in its bearing upon the pros
perity of the whole country. Speculative sen
timent was less hopeful to-day regarding the
position of the coal mining controversy. This
feeling was emphasized by rumors which found
circulation that a message to Congress by
the President on the subject was in contem
plation. Yesterday's public statement by the
operators of their position was said to involve
in effect the dissolution of the Miners' Union,
and the irreconcilable position thus presented
was felt to threaten a' lengthened contest. The
pressure upon Sugar was connected with yes
terday's testimony before the Senate committee
regarding the methods pursued in the advocacy
of the reciprocity policy. A notable decline
in May exports of the princiftal domestic arti
cles reported from Washington had a depress
ing effect, especially in view of the great im
portance of a sustained trade balance in favor
of this country during the next few months
on acount of the heavy obligations to foreign
lenders which will mature in that time. There
was also a significant- demand in the time
loan market for accommodations running over
the period of the coming semi-annual settle
ment, and of the later demand for currency to
cover crops. The market closed dull, but
steady.
The movement in the bond market was ir
regular. Total sales, $1,990,000.

Besides consuming the cabin the fire de
stroyed a large section of the fence of the
cemetery, besides spreading through 'the
dry grass and endangering many tombs.
L. Garwood and John Lopez, two chil
dren, saw the blaze, -and knowing John
ston was in the cabin rushed toward it.
Johnston was ' so sound asleep that they
could: not awaken him, so they carried
the old man from the cabin, which a few
moments afterward caved in and was a
mass of embers. Had it. not been for the
thoughtfulness of the lads Johnston
would have been incinerated. â¢ - . .Â¦
! NEVADA CITY, June 12.â That Ben
Johnston, a pioneer gravedigger, was not
cremated this afternoon was due to the
heroic efforts of two boys^ Johnston lived
in a cabin near Pine- Grove cemetery.
After eating his dinner . the gravedigger
lay down to rest, falling into, a sound
sleep.' In the meantime the cabin caught
fire. â¢â¢:â¢: - - : ' 'Â¦ ' ' . .
Young Clark acted as second. for Man

Campbell's . son acted for the boy. Both
combatants' have left : town for a whil9
until the affair blows over. '
Later at night W. A. Clark called on
Campbell and told him he would have to
fight Mangan. When the boy's father
heard of It , he told him to accept the
challenge, and -about a dozen friends of
both men drove several miles out into the
country, where a ring was formed. The
men stripped and a short but bloody bare
fist fight followed. Young Campbell was
game and landed often, but., did ; little
harm,' while the trained .athlete and
pugilist hammered the boy up bcUHyan 1 !

round. :

Campbell was a leading" figure, had a sen

A. Clark Jr. and his friend William G.
Mangan, an amateur pugilist, were at
tending a game of ball in the afternoon
and chanced to have a seat near Roy
Campbell, son of the ex-Congressman. A
studious effort was made. by Mangan to
insult young Campbell, and ho finally
asked him â¢ for a cigarette, . for which ha
offered him a half-dollar. Campbell
laughed the matter off, but when Man

J n . WASHINGTON. June 12._BIshop
Blenk of Porto Rico conferred with Secre
tary Hay to-day regarding the return of
what were formerly the convent lands ot
the Roman Catholic church. During the
Spanish occupation and before the Ameri
can invasion the buildings and lands of
two convents were seized . and put to
military use by the Spanish. Upon sur
render this property (one of the convent3
il>y alued at *70,000 and the other at $100.
000) was seized by the United States.
Bishop Blenk, on behalf of the Roman
Catholic church, recently appealed to Gov
ernor Hunt to return the property to the
church. Governor Hunt considered the
application with considerable favor, but
he was of the opinion that as Governor
he was not vested with authority sufficient
to make a decision. He referred Bishop
Blenk to the State Department. - -
The claim appears to be clear, and the
probability Is that Secretary Hay will rep
ommend to Congress that j the property
be restored to the church.

WANT GROTESQUE PEATXTRES.
Here is the announcement for the Elks'
, parade on Monday night: â¢--' *
On Monday evening of June 16, by vote of
the lodge, the Elks ' will give a grotesque pa
rade. This will be one of the biggest features
of our coming street fair; and if this parade is
a success it will do more to advertise the fair
than any other one' thing that could possibly
be carried out. â¢ '
Now, it lies with the members of the lodge
to make this parade one of the 'funniest things
ever seen in the streets of Oakland. We call
upon, you individually and rely upon you to'
get up some feature for the parade. - â¢â¢> â¢ â¢
We have already had several funny stunts
handed in; for instance, Messrs. McLauzhlln.
Heeseman and Sloan are going to give a stunt
called "The Wedding." They will have a
hack fixed up with a bride and groom made as
ridiculous as; possible; also a regulation coach
man, and such things as go to make the act
complete and grotesque. We merely quote this
to give you some idea of .what is being done. .
1 We would ask you to hand in any Ideas you
may have, so they may not be duplicated with
any other in the parade. - They will be filed
in the' order they are received. Mr.-.Mc-
Laughlin has a dozen or more funny Ideas that
could bÂ«Â» worked up. Â¦ If you have nothing j^ou
care to put on yourself and w*nt to consult him
in this matter, he will be pleased to. do any
! thing he can to help out or suggest' anything
you might want to put in the parade, , -
. . Costumers will be' in Oakland all week prior
to the 16th with a full line of costumes. This
feature was a howling, success at Sacramento.
Stocktdn, Bakergfleld and Fresno. 'â¢ . â
Trusting you will realize the Importance of
making this parade a great succes and that
you will give us an early reply. I remain,
respectfully. D. A. SINCLAIR.
Chairman Parade Committee.:
GREAT SUCCESS PREDICTED.'
A general announcement has been made
by the general committee as follows:
TO OUR CITIZENS.
. The outlook for the Elks' Street Fair Car
nival, of being a great success, is very encour
aging, from every point of view, especially finan
cially. Every stall in the central part of the
grounds has been taken up, and there remains
only a few on the side streets now to be had.
The work of fitting up .the stands, stalls, etc..
is almost completed,' and a large portion of the
stalls now rented are being rapidly, and beauti
fully decorated by their occupants. . j
The general decoration and lighting of the.
grounds, music stands, etc., by the committees
appointed for that purpose, Is being* vigorously
.pushed to completion. '. ':Â¦*_ Â¦Â¦Â¦
The committee would . urge upon renters the
desirability of decorating: their stalls at once,
in order that' when the carnival opens on Sat
urday morning everything, may be in place and
no fit t Ins uy -of stalls or arranging of ex
hibits will interfere with the ceremonial and.
enjoyments of the" day, but everything will go
along smoothly from the beginning.
The committee have spared no pains .to 'in-,
sure the citizens of Oakland and" - Alameda
County, as well as our visitors from other por
tions of the State and coast generally, a week
of undiluted pleasure, and respectfully, request
the benefit of their assistance in so doing.
Yours respectfully, â¢ â¢ '

REDDING. June 12.-With the news of
the death of a beautiful girl, formerly of
Bedding, at Spokane, comes also the story
cf the remarkable romance of the lives of
tier long separated and now reunited par
ents. Great happiness came after twenty
j ears only to be dissipated by the unex
pected death of the daughter.
Back in Ohio twenty-one years ago
Jialpn McAlpine, a boy of 19. fell in love
with a girl of 17, and their parents con
sented to the wedding. Affairs went not
emoothly for the boy and soon after a
t>aoy girl was born he resolved to come
i Â£ l ?r make a. fortune for his wife and
toe' lV e kissed them eood-by and came
Fortune did not smile on the young man
tnd soon pride prevented his writing home
until he should make a stake. After a
few years young Mrs. McAlpine gave her
husband up for lost, married John Kent
u. er '^ many vears her senior, and moved to
Heading. They were not happy and part
ed. The mother supported herself and
daughter by dressmaking. She neve
ceased to mourn her first husband, McAl
pine, and often talked of him.
A year ago Mrs. Kentner and her daugh
ter moved to Spokane. Several weeks ago
mother and daughter were Xn a restaurant
when the mother saw a man she believed
to be her first husband. Ehe caught his
eye, but he gave no sign. She dropped her
handkerchief and he restored it with a
formal bow. She learned that his name
Â¦was McAlpine and sent a letter to his ho
tel and he hurried to her. He was the
long-lost husband. In tears he told the
tale of boyish pride and hard luck. When
fortune improved, his letters to Ohio were
pent back. His wife and child had left
there. This spring McAlpine made a large
fortune in a British Columbia mine He
remarried his wife at once and showered
Jewels and luxuries upon his wife and
f 3 a , ugrh L e ,r- , But , the ereat happiness came
late. The daughter was failing in health
and several days ago she died.

OAKES EXPLAINS
TO GRAND JURY
OAKLAND, June 12.â Oakland
blossomed, out In carnival colors
to-day, and to-night the electric
lights -were turned on for the
first time. To-morrow night will
be the opening parade, and on
Saturady afternoon at 1 o'clock
the Elks Carnival and Street Fair .will be
opened to the public.
For the first time in the history of Oak
land general electric decorations have
been made. Heretofore the only decora
tions that have been attempted in Oak
land for any public event have been bunt
ing and flags, but for the Elks* Fair a
general scheme of electric lighting has
been attenuated in imitation of that now
in San Francisco for the Shrlners. The
streets of the city are hung with strings
of electric lights, and the City Hall is
outlined in electricity. Nearly every
store in the city is hung with the carnival
colors, the purple of the Elks and the
gold and white of the fair.
While the merchants have been deco
rating, thousands of carpenters and dec-
the various members and committees are
trying to outdo each other in weird ideas.
The following announcement has been
made of the orders and arrangements for
the opening parade I Friday night by
Grand Marshal George E. de Golia and
his chief of staff, F. J. Lea.

BOAN'S KIDNEY PILLS.
John J. Murphy, of 1604 Turk street
marine engineer, identified with the Fire
Department for twenty-five years as a
regular and two years as a substitute
connected with engines at Companies No'
4, 10 and 26, says: "A quarter of a cen-
tury spent as a fireman Is decidedly hard
on ttte constitution and this may account
for a derangement or a sluggish condi-
tion of my kidneys which has annoyed
me for some time. It struck me while
reading advertisements about Doan's
Kidney Pills if they performed half what
they promised they might help me, and I
went to the Owl Drug Co., 1126 Market
street, for a box. They were just the rem-
edy I required. Since the treatment my
general health has been much better. I
am averse to public notoriety, but you
can use my statement or send anyone
to me for a personal endorsation of it,
because a remedy whJch acts as repre-
sented should be known to everybody."

Public exposure of the Kern County
bond transaction and revelations relating
to the scandalous management of affairs
at San Quentin, together with the de
feat of the push at Sari Jose, have utterly
demoralized the machine forces. There
is no end of wrangling in the boss camp
of this city. The district henchmen of
the administration are misled and con
fused by various rumors. One day they
are advised that Burns will lead them in
the campaign and the next i day they are
toid that Johnny Mackenzie has the real
programme. Rumors that Martin Kelly
will be assigned to the leadership of the
push column deepen the general confu
sion. It is- conceded In all factions that
Gcge is practically out of the' race for
renomination. It is known ' that Herrin
and Crimmlns are working together in
the face of- Burns' public avowal that he
would "not do politics with any man high
or low that had anything to do with
Ciimmins.

Two months ago, when the Republicans
of California were confronted with the
danger of Gage's nomination for another
term as Governor, the Democrats readily
engaged In plans for a vigorous cam
paign. They fancied that victory could
easily be won if the Republicans put for
ward as their candidate a discredited and
unpopular exponent of push politics. The
San Jose election and other events have
low convinced the Democratic politicians
that the Republican-party, has no notion
of committing the : blunder of proposing
Gage for another term, hence the lack of
campaign enthusiasm among Democrats.
There is need of Republican vigilance,
however. It will be called to mind that
Democrats voting for Republican del
egates to the local convention in San
Francisco last year gave the bosses and
the railroad the power to control the con
vention and programme the nominations.
Republican citizens, in order to prevent a
looting of the city, were Impelled to de
feat the ticket put forward by the bosses.
Republicans should now adopt every
measure of precaution within the law to
prevent Democrats from voting for the
delegates to the Republican State con
vention. The leaders of the Democratic
party are so anxious for the nomination
of Gage that they will resort to any trick
or device to strengthen him. Word comes
from Los Angeles that the push forces in
that city arÂ» depending on Democrats to
help Gage In the south. The Inactivity of
tho Democratic County Committee of this
city and the peculiar attitude of leading
Democrats create the impression that Los
Angeles tactics may be introduced here
on tho 12th of August next.

After the second dance. President Clark

to have the same presented to her before

the party had been seated an usher an
nounced that somebody had blundered in
showing him to that box, Â¦ as it was thd
grand president's, but Lunstedt produced
his tickets and declined to vacate for the
grand president or any one else. There
was an effort to effect a change, but It
could not be done, and Lunstedt retained
the decorated stage box. â¢
Last night more than 1200 people attend

John McGrath Has Narrow
. Escape From
Death.
A Southern Pacific local freight train
of forty-seven cars, drawn by one
of the . big Mogul engines, .= No. 1719,
met with a slight mishap yesterday after
noon at 1 o'clock at . Â¦â¢ Twenty-sixth
and Guerrero streets. As the 'train
was approaching the two-story tower
house alongside of the track, the draw
bar pulled out from the head car and fall
ing on theÂ» track was the means of de
railing the forward truck. The car in
swerving from the rails bounded against
the tower, house and totally demolished it.
The^- tower was turned completely
around and overturned. The roof was
wrenched off, and as the structure fell to
the ground the spectators were amazed
to see the form- of Gatekeeper John Mc-
Grath come rolling out through the aper
ture where once had been the roof.
Strange to relate, McGrath was found to
be but slightly injured, being bruised on
the head and limbs by the falling tim
bers. . .
Superintendent B. A. Worthington hap
pened to be on a passenger train
that followed the freight. He at once
made inquiries' into the affair and
under his direction the line was cleared
for the resumption of traffic within fif
teen minutes.
The train was in charge of Engineer
dowry and Conductor Byrne.
â¢ After the workmen had assembled to
clear away the wreck McGrath. seemed
deeply moved- by some emotion.
Mr. Worthington, who was glad to see
that. the gatekeeper had not been serious
ly hurt, asked the reason of his depres
sion. v â¢
"I am "worried,' sir, at the loss of my
pipe and tobacco," said McGrath, and
straightway he went to the demolished
tower to try to recover the precious ar
ticles. Not succeeding in finding them.
John went to his lunch, but returned
hurriedly, still looking worried and again
he resumed a fruitless search among the
piled-up timbers of the tower for his pipe
and tobacco. ' â¢
The incident caused a good deal of
amusement to the onlookers, but John
McGrath continued sad over his loss.
A new one-story tower house will take
the place of the wrecked structure.
