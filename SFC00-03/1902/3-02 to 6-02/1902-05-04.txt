season there are washable cotton outing
skirts, made in plain and fancy? striped
covert cloth and brown linen, linen crash,
pique and duck skirts In pedestrian and
full dress lengths, finished in tucked,
strapped J and bias folds, becomingly
trimmed.
For golfing the fancy knitted vests, in
striped or solid colors, with double rows
of gold buttons, still find most favor.
With them is worn a large puff tie over a
deep soft stock.
The tennis skirt this year' is In either
white pique or white duck, with three
buttons on each side in front and invert
ed pleat in the back. The shirt waist to
be worn with this is either the Gibson o\r
the Maxime effect, In white pique with
the yoke back.
Of hats there never was a more beauti
fully becoming variety, and it \s a strange ,J
thing to find the nobbiest of them being
sold this year side by side with men's
head gear in the most fashionable mascu
line batteries. Truly, In the line of fash
ions at least, the world "it do move."
water. It is trimmed . with a Â«two-Inch
wide band of blue or red braid, or both,
down the front of the waist. The belt
and the hem of the skirt are edged with
the same material. There is no collar to
this suit, which makes It particularly
comfortable to swim in. .
For a tall, slender girl there is a stylish
suit of the same material, with a plaited
Gibson waist and gored skirt;
Another novelty this year is a striped
dark suit, with a large red sailor collar
edged In white braid. The belt is trimmed
with the same material, while the wide
gored skirt is, elaborately' braided from
wa"st to hem. ;. -.
There is also a navy blue flannel suit,
with a finely, plaited skirt and large col
lar, trimmed with white. braid; and fancy
alpaca suits in brown,- red, blue and
black, with large circular collars, trimmed
with gilt and white tubular â¢ braid.
The belts are plain and the skirts are
gored without trimming.
The proper thing with all these suit*
are fancy striped and. ribbed stockings
and caps to match.
The new shirt waist suits may be fas
tened either front or back. One of the
prettiest shown on this page is of â¢ plain
mercerized silk-finished batiste, trimmed
with . embroidery galloons, large * medal
lions and velvet ribbons. The skirt is
made after the latest full flare .lounoa
pattern.
Another pretty washable costume Is of
fancy white Swiss trimmed with black
festoon lace. The blouse is made with a
white lace-trimmed vest, elbow sleeves,
with extra Inserted sleeves, and finished
at the waist with black velvet ribbon.
Down the back there are three rows of
black chantilly festoon lace, and six rows
down the front, with two rows running
from the shoulder to the elbow.
The skirt is made in a flounce, with
fan back, trimmed with a circular festoon
of the same Chantilly lace, with a lawn
drop.. The hat should match. One of the
most effective is a new walking design of
Panama straw trimmed with the same
lace and white chiffon, with a large quill
or a rose or two, as the taste of the
Wearer dictates. '- .. â¢ Â¦ V Â¦
Another pretty shirt waist suit is in
white and pink. The waist is plain white

cult is of ecru batiste trimmed in blue.
The waist is made with wide tucks
trimmed with Clunle lace galloons and
finished with a yoke of fine batiste and
Valenciennes Insertions. The sleeves are
tucked to the elbow, . the same as the
waist, where they are finished with fine
Clunle lace galloons. From the elbow to
the waist the sleeve is of delicate batiste,

ters of an Inch wide, which shows the
pretty Â¦ pink of the arms and shoulders
gleaming beneath. -

tho waist, with CTunie lace festoons run
ning from tuck to hem, m while the big
flounce Is trimmed, both top and bottom,

postilion back is made of plain golf bas
ket cloth. The Eton Is trimmed with vel
vet piping I and stitched ' velvet pointed
tabs In rows of three. -The skirt has a
graduated flare flounce with eleven rows

very latest is 'made with eleven gores,
flaring at the bottom like a morning
glory. â¢ Each gore has a stitched strap
finished at the bottom, with three buttons
over ten rows of fine stitching. - These
skirts come in tan and black and the
fashionable shade of oxblood. "

THE week beginning on Sunday,
May, 4, will bring Mars in close as
i pect to the sun. This planetary con
j dition will cause a conservative at-
X. titudo to prevail throughout the
world of trade and commerce. This
week will not be a propitious one for the
promotion of new enterprises.
There are likely to be serious disagree
ments between capital and labor, with the
possibility of strikes during the next seven
days.
The money market will be tight. Specu
lation will be uncertain, with some short
and sudden turns.
Health conditions are not good for this
week. People will be prone to suffer from
J sluggish circulation and Inflammations.
The weather will be warm with rain and
thunder storms until the 7th, followed by
clear and pleasant conditions.
Marriage.
This Is not a propitious time for enter
ing the matrimonial state. The latter
part of the week Â¦will be perhaps the
luckier, but tho^e who wed during the
next peven days will experience much Jeal
ousy and will have very eventful marital
careers.
Business.

May 5, Mondayâ Business should be
good upon this day. The most propitious
hour for the signing of important papers
and for the consummation of large busi

Just think of that! What a boon this in
to women of troublesome embonpoint,
and yet how delightfully simple. The se
cret is just this: The waist'is made with
a broad, snug-fitting belt, which serves
the purpose of a corset, the skirt is fin
ished with the snugness of a tailor-made,
and longitudinal stripes on the skirt and
waist and even the stockings give the
much-tp-be-desired effect of . unusual
height and slenderness. For the thin girl
the suit is made to fit much more loosely
and; the stripes are run around -the other
way.
There are bathing suits to make the
tall, thin girl look plump and pleasing,
and other bathing suits to make the
short, plump girl seem willowy and tall.
But the real sensation of the season is
the new bathing suit, which must now
be selected with as much care as a wed
ding trousseau. Time was when anything
of voluminous length and width, no mat
ter how cumbersome, was considered the
only modest costume permissible, but the
outing girl who does not choose her
suit with proper regard for fit and color
this year will be looked upon as densely
ignorant.
These, however, must not be confound

golfing. The proper length this year Is

fj be superstitious. They hesitate to
r\ admit the truth of the assertion,
\ but, like all men who are constant
ly exposed to danger, they come to
expect disaster to be preceded by a herald.
"No; I am not superstitious," said one,
"but mj wife is, and I have never been
In a wreck since we were married but
what she predicted It was going to occur.
I remember when I was running out of
Sedalla on the Rio Grande that by her
insistence in the truth of a dream she
saved my life. I was to have taken out
the freight In the morning, but, she
awakened me soon after midnight. 'Oh,
Jim,' she said, 'I have had such a dread
ful dream. I thought I saw 404 (that was
my engine) plunge into another engine.
I heard the crash, Jim, and the hiss of
escaping steam, and the cries of the poor
fellows pinned under the wreck. You
must not go out In the morning. I know
you will be injured.' I laughed at her
and told her to go to sleep; that she was
nervous. She protested," but I was tired,
and was soon snoozing the sleep of the
Just. When I awoke at 6 o'clock she was
pale and haggard, and I saw that if I
went out she would be a nervous wreck
before I returned. I decided to give in for
once and I fixed it up so that another man
took out my train. His body was brought
back that evening. They had' had a col-
Usion up the line. My substitute was
killed, and the other engineier and both
firemen were badly injured. I pay more
attention to my wife's dreams now. but
I consider it cowardly to attempt to act
upon thtm. If my engine is going into a
smash-up I will be at the throttle, and
the little woman at home must depend
upon her prayers to save me.

Superstitions of Raifroad Engineers
Tom Loftus of the Colorado and South
ern looked serious when the subject of
engineers' superstitions was broached.
"Well, I have an unlucky day," said he,
"or, maybe, it is a lucky day, for although
all. kinds of mishaps occur to my engine
on that day, I have so far escaped Injury.
It is the last day of the year. When I
climb into the cab on December 31 I al
ways say: 'Now, look out, Tom, old man.'
Ten years ago the coming December 31,
I was pounding along on a double-header
from Trinidad to Denver. We were mak
ing about thirty miles an hour .through a
blinding snowstorm. You- couldn't see
fifty feet ahead. Between Benares and
Huerfano we crashed into another doubls
header, which was making about forty
miles an hour in the direction of Trinidad.
I saw the 'other train in time to reverse
and Jump. I escaped without serious in
jury, but one of the firemen on the train
bound south" was killed and the rest of
of my life: On July 13, 1901. I was pulling
train No. 7 out of Denver. At thirteen
minutes past 12 I struck a wagon con
taining Max Wagoner and his 13-year-old
boy near Petersburg. The boy was killed.
I reported the accident from the Littleton
office and was delayed just thirteen min
utes. At Palmer Lake the conductor
casually remarked that we had just thir
teen passengers in the sleeper for Cripple
Creek."
Then the fun begins. They want wives
â very naturally. But how are they to
get them? All the female monkeys of the
country belong to the harem of some bis
brute or other. Clearly, the only solution
Is to attack such a harem, kill the gotha
(the aforesaid big brute) and then divide
the spoils. War is declared. The battle is
a fierce one and often lasts several days.
The party attacked always tries to retreat
and often traverses several jungles, fields
and even villages. But the pursuit is hot
and vigorous, and at last a stand has to
be madeâ sometimes in a village green or
even an orchard of some country man
sion. In the actual fight the females
generally remain faithful to their lord and
master and help him fiercely against his
numerous assailants. But the result Is a
foregone conclusion, and the several
widows, .after a very short period of
mourningâ usually manifested by a show
of ill temperâ are consoled by the vic
torious males,
Now these battles cause sad havoo to
the fields and orchards of the country and
often prove a positive danger to the peo
ple, for though monkeys seldom attack
men, woe to the luckless one who ven
tures to come near them in their deadly
struggle. Moreover, when pressed by
hunger, these packs are not to be trifled,
with. You may not mind even the dam
age done to your orchard by hundreds of
monkeys gobbling up everything they can
lay their hands on, but it is quite a dif
ferent matter when you have to shut
your doors and windows and stay In for
days at a time because of the army out- Â¦
side.
Consequently the object of the natives
is to break up these packs by capturing
their leaders. Killing is against the dic
tates of conscience, but capture is not, esn I
pecially as the monkey is liberated in a
short time, as will appear presently. So.
when a pack is about, the natives employ
the following method: Close to an orchard
a bit of level space is selected and a hole
dug in it, about two feet deep and six or
eight Inches in diameter. A noose is made
at one end of a long, stout cord and *
placed over the mouth of the hole. The
cord is then passed through a pulley or
ring attached to a tree close to the house
and the other end held some distance
away ty a concealed person. The noosa
and about ten or fifteen feet of the cord'
are covered with sand. Then a nice,
tempting banana is placed in the hole
and a number of rotten onesâ covered,
however, with fresh skinsâ are strewn aU
over the ground.
When the pack comes, the females arÂ»
too shy to venture out into the open space
near the house, but the big trotha is a
brave fellow. He sees the banana on tha
ground, leaps down, takes up one. throws
it away In disgust, then another, with tha
same result. Suddenly he notices the nice,
tempting one in the hole and plunges his
arm in. Immediately the cord is pulled,
the noose fastened on the arm close to tha
shoulder, and tha monkey dragged willy
nilly to the tree, where the pulley orrtnjr
is attached. Then the hiding shikari comes
forth, and, circling: round and round tha
tree with the cord held tight in his hand. I
binds the unfortunate monkey safe and
fast, all but the head. The pulley or ring S
is Introduced not merely to bind the mon
key to tha tree, but also became it would
be highly dangerous to drat* tha Infuriated '
brute ri*ht up to a person.
ThÂ»-mockoy, however, is not killed. la
stead, they lather hi* head and face, bo
special care being taken in selecting tha
finest soap or the purest water. Tha opera
tion is an interesting one and a source
of great amusement to the bystanders.
The monkey, however, dodges his head
about, only to get a good dose of soap in
his eyes and mouth. . Then be has enough
of it, especially as he feels dreadfully '
achy all over and the cords cutting into
his body every inchâ to say nothing: of tha
I personal remarks and the highly adject
ival language of the bystanders. . He sub
mits to his ' fate with eastern stoicism.
His head is shaved clean as a billiard ball
and then his face as well, nice and smooth
like a baby's. Then they let him go. But
alas, such is the vanity of life, his wives
will not have him now that his beauty has
gone. They disown him completely, cut
him dead. Nay. they drive him away from

mONKEYS in India are an un
mitigated nuisance, especially In
the country. I have often coma
across in the jungles adjoining
the villages of Northern Bengal whole
troops of them, whose depredations In
filelds and orchards were the despair of
the unfortunate villagers. These troops
always consist of one huge mala and
about 100 females. The fact Is, when a
little monkey is born in the pack it is
suffered to live if a female, but instantly
killed by the father if It happens to be a
male. The mother, however, sometimes
manages jo hide the little one until ha is
able to get about, and then sends him
away before the big male catches sight
of him. In this way it often happens that
individual males are to be found living by
themselves in single blessedness. Now,
getting tired of solitude after a time and
perhaps believing in union as a source of
strength, these bachelors often join to
gether and form a pack of their ownâ a
sort of club.
Monkey Lore From the
Wilas of India.
She was waiting for him under the
oiive trees, ahead of time at the tryst,
but that was because all of her days were
spent in the old orchard. An idle sun
shiny life hers had been, and into it now
had ccme love, passionate, adoring love.
She did not recognize it by that name,
by any name. She only knew that the
blood that had hitherto flowed languor
ously through her veins rushed tumul
tucusly at the stir of a footstep in the
grass, at the sound of a voice singing
through the trees; that her heart, which
nothing had ever stirred, beat so furi
ously that the little brown hand pressed
against it could hardly hold it in, and, in
her day dreams, and at night, when she
slept, there was ever present one face,
one voice. This love had come to her
suddenly, unbidden, and as yet she asked
nothing more from it than it gave; she
was a child in years, a child in know
ledge. -''^"'' Â¦ . .* :
At first the senor painter had only been
kind to her, letting her sit beside him
while he worked, listening to her tales
and songs. Very soon, though, Churchill
became Senor Juan or simply Juaoâ Jack
wae an impossible name for the Spanish
lips to pronounceâ and then Chita was
with him. from early dewy morning until
late at night. Churchill knew well
enough what was coming, what these
days and nights and all this dallying
through the sweet-scented grass would
lead to, but he was content to wait; the
end was sure, and just as one holds a
Class of green chartreuse for a moment.
Inhaling Its fragrance of a hundred
flowers, so Churchill held this cup from
his lips. Ha had no thought of the fu
ture, no thought of what would become
of Chita when he had gone, but lived in
the present end for the present.
The bells had grown quiet; the hills

I / mission gate watching the sunset
V I colors flame and fade over the
J^ western hills. The chimes were
still sending their sweet tones
across the valley, while swallows darted
swiftly through the golden atmosphere,

sounded the chirping and twittering of
small birds crowding Into their nests. He
had spent several weeks at San Juar.
Bautista had watched many sunsets
from the old iron gate leading into the
mission close. Now his sketches were
finished but something still held him in
the little town. It was Chita.
They watched It silently. Churchill lay
with his elbow on the ground, one hand
supporting his head and the other playing
idly with Chita's little brown fingers. She
was bo content to be there with him,
breathing the perfumed air of n'.ght and
watching the light as it slowly climbed
the hills and flooded the valley.^The. olive
covered hillside slopes rapidly down from
the mission to the pear orchard, planted
a century ago by Padre Juan Junlsto. The
trees are, many of them, stillaliye and
bearing In spite of years of neglect and
blight. Here and there one that has given

den, andâ see!". She gave a low cry and
pointed toward the cast/ where a round
silver ball was slowly floating up over the
pine-clad hills into a sea of blue.

set colors were so beautiful! I couldn't
leave until they had quite faded away;
but I wished so much that you were there
to see them with me."
were merely blue-black shadows against
a blue-black sky; the evening star hung
like a beacon light on the crest of the
range; one belated swallow scurried to its
nest under the earthen tiles; the old gate
creaked on its hinges and Churchill was
in the orchard. He walked slowly jast
the adobe church, over which wild black
berry vines were trailing. The gray-green
leaves of the olive trees quivered In the
evening breeze, and, half-aloud, Churchill
murmured:
But the olives they were not blind to him.
The little gTay leaves were kind to him,
"When into the woods he came. â¢
He raised his eyebrows lightly and
shrugged his shoulders. Religion played
no part in his life, and there was some
thing in the suggestion of the lines trat
annoyed him. He began to sing softly,
and Chita sprang from the shadow of the
trees to meet him. Her lap was full ot
flowers, which fell to the ground, and on
her head was a twisted wreath cf wild
blackberry leaves and blossoms. Churchill
had sketched her as a dryad crowned
with . this wreath of leaves. Tj-ngtit
when he saw it he frowned, and again
came an unwelcome thoughtâ the crown
of thorns. '
"You are late a litt'e, Senorâ Juan."
Chita's beautiful face was close to his,
the red lips raised to his; but Churchi'l
knew what his kiss would bring to her.
and still he waited. He threw himself
down on the grass, crushing the flowers
under him.
ble at first, bat he made a second effort.
"Chita, Iâ I am going away. Iâ I cams
to-night to say good-by. I must go early;
early in the morning."- He did not move,
nor did she. There was no outward sound,
but In Chita's ears there was the rush and
roar of a shattering universe. Suddenly
Churchill sprang. to his feet, raised the
girl In his arms and covered her lips and
eyes and hair with kisses. Only once ha
breathed "I love you," and then the
ilender figure clung to him. Almost
.roughly he untwined her arms from about
his neck and laid her on the ground. She
was stunned by the passion of love that .
surged through her; she was conscious
only of his words. "I love you." The
clang of the Iron gate aroused her. He
had said that he was going! He had said
good-by! ! She stumbled to her feet and
followed him. The gate was fastened on
the outside. She beat her hand3 against
the iron and called aloud her lover's namÂ».
but there was no answer. He had gona

"In Wolfville, we-all allers recalls that
eharp-Bet gent who comes after Cherokee
with respect. In fact he wins 'our enco
miums before he sets in ag'in Cherokeeâ
before ever he gets his second drink at
the Red Light bar. He comes raxnblin'

"Tell you-all a story about gamblin':

"Which this yere matter of wealth,
that a-way," be continued, "is a mighty
sight a question of luck. Shore, a gent
has to have capacity to grasp a chance
an' savey sufficient to get his chips down
right. But this yere chance, an' whether
it offers itse'f to any specific sport, is
frequent accident; an' its comin' or fail
ure to come depends on conditions over
which the pcrty about to be enriched
ain't got no control. That's straight, son!
You-all backtrack any big fortune to its
beginnin', an' some'ers along the trail or
at the farthest end, you'll come up on
the fact that it took a accident or two,
what we-all dar-cenefl mortals calls 'luck,'
to make good thy play. It's like gettin'
shot, gettin' rich is; all you has to do is
to be present a whole lot at the time an'
the bullet does the rest.
"You distrusts these doctrines. You
shore won't if you sets down hard an'
thinks. Suppose twenty gents has made
a surround an' is huntin' a b'ar. Only
one is goin" to down him. An' in his
clumsy blunclerin's, the b'ar is goin' to
select that executioner himse'f. That's a
fact; the party v.-ho downs that b'ar,
rinal, ain't goin to pick the b'ar out; the
b'ar is goin' to picii him out. An' it's the
same about wealth; one gent gets the bar
a,n' the other nineteenâ an' they're jest as
cunnin' an' industr'ous as the lucky party
â don't get nothing â don't even get a. shot.
I repeats, tharfore, that you-all settin'
yere this evenin', firm' off .aimless ob
servations, don't know whether you'll
quit rich or not."
At the close of his dissertation, my talk
ative companion puffed, a dense cloud
which seemed to hang above his vener
able head in a fashion of heavy blue Â«ip
yioval. I paused a respectful moment
and a.s one impressed by the uttered wis
dom of the old gentleman. Then I took
another tack.
"Speaking of wealth." I said, " tell me
concerning the largest money you ever
knew to be won or lost at faro â tell me
a gambling story."
"Tell you a gamblin' tale." he repeated,
and then mused as if lost in retrospec
tion. "If I hesitates it's because of a
multitoode of incidents from which to
draw. I've beheld some mighty cur'ou*?
doin's at the gamblin' tables". Once I
knows a party who sinks his hopeless
head on a layout an' dies as he loses his
last chip. This don't happen in Wolfville
none. Xo, I don't say folks ain't cashed
in at farobank in that excellent hamlet
an' gone singin' to their home above, but
it ain't heart disease, that a-way. Usual
it's guns; the same bein' invoked by sech
inadvertencies as pickin' up some other
gent's bet. \
My friend's tone breathed a note of
strong contradiction, while his glance was
the sapient glance of much experience.
I had said that I carried no hope of be
coming rich; that the members of my
tribe were born with their hands open and
had such hold of money as a riddle has of
water. It was this which moved him to
expostulatory denial.

man, "riches, says you! Neither

And thus the populating at the new

Rajah had not yet become one of them.
He was still on his way from Bartell's in
New York. That sounds very highfaluting
and aristocratic, but the -plain truth is
that Â¦ Rajah was making the long and
hazardous trip simply, as a "consign

could be trapped In the wilds of Africa
and then be shipped half way round the
world simply as a "consignment.":.
But worse than all else, he was not
even received as an honored guest. When
the new Chutes was planned by the archi
tect a certain number of cages were de
signed and their dimensions given to Mr.
Hall, the animal trainer. He counted the
beasts in his. care and found that he
would have cages and to spare. Then it

after day as If by magic, but though thi
new grounds are larger than the olo
Halght street site everything thereon Is
built on a more lavish scale.
The menagerie and cafe take up the
whole west elde of the block, with an ele
vated promenade extending all around th
south side of the lake to connect with the,
entrance to the scenic railway and the
new Ferris wheel on the east side, while
the chutes themselves, with a brand new
novelty called the "old mill race, ' win,
fill up the entire north end of the
grounds, where the vaudeville theater
used to be in the old resort.
The new theater is simply colossal, it
is nearly twice as big as the old one ana
has sÂ» seating capacstv of over 4000. It U
so large, in fact, that it had to be erectep
on a neighboring block all by itself, with
a broail street separating it from the
main grounds. Then a wide tunnel ha/j
to be dug under the street to connect tlio
two sections. It is because everything
has been constructed on this large seal,
that thrre wiis very little space left be

terials, and so it happened that when the
former denizfiis of tiie jungle were give;,
their lirst trolley party car ride from the
old Chutes to the new. there was no plae-c
to put them when they arrived.
The llamas and the emu were given
temporary quarters in the foyer of the
new theater. Near them the sea lions,
and the alligator were placed in cold
storage in the respective halves of an old
rask that had been sawed in two and
filled with water for their especial ben
efit. The pelicans followed the sea lions
as a matier of course and kept up a con
tinual bickering for elbow room in the
narrow tubs.
The trouble began when the new
menagerie was being populated with Its
brave display of jungle beasts before th<.
bullding itself was completely finished.
The workmen and the animals alike sei

DROP a nickel and be delighted."
That mysteriously alluring sign,
gayly blazoned on a gaudily paint
ed board half-concealed under the
rapidly accumulating debris at the
new Chutes, is aptly expressive of the
epirit of the place. To that end there has
been a vast deal of building within the
high inclosing walls of the big pleasure
EToant's just across the way from tht
new m..*ic stand at the park, which arc
more extensive by a full block than the
old resort on Haight street. And out of
the chaos thereof, which has existed like
a reign of terror for two months past,
there arose such strange, startling scenes
as never will be outdone In all the long
list of future attractions.
Thus the work of building and populat
ing the new Chutes at one and the same
time went on swiftly apace. As each new
box of birds or beasts or reptiles arrived,
they were stored separately or in piles
in any convenient corner that could be
found until their cages were made ready
to receive them, when they were dis
played conspicuously In their new quar
ters, like a 'consignment of silks in a bar
gain sale -show window.
In this way there was a continual pro
cession of wild animals of all degrees of
abject servitude back and forth through
the long tunnel. It was days and days
before the family of bears were given a
more comfortable bed than they had been
able to make for themselves on the as
sorted implements in the tool shed. The
lions, the leopards, the pumas and 'he
tiger, as the most uncertain quantity In
the whole jungle colony, were naturally
given precedence in their domestic ar
rangements, though they were not all tin
ally settled comfortably without much
recourse to the hated moving boxes,
against which they fought long and
Btubbornly.
Then when all else was In readiness,
the home of the emu and the llama in
the foyer of the new theater was rudely
broken up and, with the bears from the
tool shed, they were herded down through
the .tunnel and across the main ground.
Here one of the llamas, which had b?on
holding its head loftily erect in proud dis
dain of the plodding bruin, suddenly
In the midst of this excitement, how
ever, the hyena got loose from hia moor
ings while being dragged about from cage
to cage and mixed things with a era to
of monkeys In a far corner of the me
nagerie. This roused the whole jungle
colony to eager expectancy, and the lions,
the tiger, the jaugars, the lecpard, and
even the pumas, set the bars of their
cages twanging merrily in their frantic
efforts to get out and add this laughing
beast to their limited menu. But Bill
was soon rounded up again and lodged
safely in a narrow little cage at the end
of the building, from which he could
neither see nor be seen.
tune. They were rounded up like wild
cattle on the range and driven headlong
Into the bubbling water of the new tank,
where a hearty meal of smelt made them
all feel quite at home.
Meanwhile In the menagerie a new dif
ficulty had arisen from an entirely new
and unexpected source. A carpenter had
been detailed to place an extra fine wire
screen around the miniature aviary .tn
which a whole flock of cockatoos and par
rots were confined. He entered It boldly
enough, as one entirely careless of dan
ger. With him he carried a strip of lath
ing to hold the edge of the screen in
place. To^the assembled birds of loud
voice and louder plumage the lathing
seemed a most convenient perch, and
when the careful carpenter raised It Into
place to see how well It would fit before
nailing it over the screen there was a
sudden deafening flapping and whirring
of wings and the whoie flock settled on
the strip of lathing as one bird. The car
penter was nearly frightened Into hys
terics by the suddenness of the onslaught,
but thereafter he had to accept with pa
tient equanimity all the efforts of the
meddlesome cockatoos to assist him at
his labors. They would perch upon his
head and shoulders and take turns in
clutching at his hammer while he nailed
the wire netting to the wall. At one time
they were all so busily assisting him that
he was forced to retire and leave the
work to the birds themselves.
THE SUNDAY CAXIi;

.scarcely breathe â¢ while he waa being
dragged out of his comfortable bath and
over a pile of chips and sawdust. The
rest was comparatively easy. In a min
ute or two more he was securely bound
up in long lengths of stout rope and
transported down through the tunnel like
a two-by-four strip of scantling.
Following the dispossession of the alli
gator, the sea lions determined to strike
the first blow for liberty themselves. As>
there was no enclosing fence around their
own half of the divided cask, they flopped
over the edge and led the pelicans a mer
ry chase down the- long incline, through
the tunnel and up over the other side to
the empty basin of the lake, across which
a force of workmen were carrying the
new hobby horses, slipping and sliding
the while through the ooze of soft as
phaltum like bees in a Dot^of honey.
The sudden advent of the sea lions and
their pelican" satellites created a sensa
tional stampede among the carpenters
and builders. An enthusiastic sea lion
looks as formidable a? a wild bull . and
when he moves in droves there is some
thing awe-inspiring in the spectacle.
Everybody gave them a wide berth ex-
ncmlnious title, quite as if his hide had
already been tanned into a long strap o*
leather f on hand -satchels.' But as a
"consignment,", the alligator's first dip
into the,water in the inverted cask felt
just as good as if he had been called by
any other name. He flopped his huge
tail about in complete satisfaction and
buried all but the tip of his long snout
in the dark depths of the muddy water.
As a "consignment," he had come and
as a "consignment" he was satisfied to
remain among the untamable populace of
the new Chutes, but he was not allowed
to bask for long in the sunshine of his
own contentment. The space he occu
pied was needed "for nail kegs. He must
move, but move he would not. It mat
tered not to him that a new concrete
alogues and price lists and ordered a con
signment of wild animals, "good show
ers," just as the parvenu rich of the pres
ent day buy their libraries by the yard.
So It was that Bajah discovered when
he arrived hero, if he was not already too
sullen to take notice of the. fact, that he
had' not only crossed the continent and
the ocean merely as a "consignment," but
that his price had been fixed .and paid be
fore he had even been tracked and
trapped, simply to complete an architec
tural scheme.
Â¦ -;No wonder _ he^ has been ' sulking ever

Mr. Harriman has always been some
thing of a student. It was his taste for
research that prompted him two years
ago to take a half-hundred well-known
scientists, artists and literary men on a
three months' expedition to Alaska. The
expenses of the entire trip were paid by
Mr. Harriman, and much was learned of
the geological formation, the flora and
fauna and previously unexplored parts of
the land of the aurora and the great
"white silence." . > V
Mr. Harriman stated his Intention of
visiting Stanford and Berkeley during his
stay, adding: "It is a good thing to have
those two universities here, because it
creates a spirit of rivalry, which is al
ways good."
I had begun to despair, but here was a
phantom chance.
"What do you think of a college educa
tion for boys?" I ventured.
He read my purpose instantly. He hes
itated before replying:
"It's all right; it's a good thing. Every
boy should have a college education if
he can. But it Is not necessary, you un
derstand. It Is not against the boy who
does not have it."
"You think, then, there Is room at the
top for boys who never go to college?"
"Yes."
It was another case of Q. E. D., and
he knew it. Edward H. Harriman stopped
school at 16, when he was just beginning
to struggle with Latin verbs.

"No, It is not right to say that every

Mr. Harriman has Irred practically all

Miss Averlll, a woman .of charming man

The Harrlmans live plainly In New

preferring to enjoy .themselves and their

be counted among the fashionables who
rule society. It may. make a difference,
now that two of the Misses Harriman

and had talked about the beauties of
California and the evolution of railway

sitting upon live lilyfpads, arjd live ter

crumbs thrown to them by the guestsâ a
banquet reported, to have cost $7000 for a
half-hundred men. He smiled.
There was something affable and friend
ly in the voice that settled the question
of his identity, and just a bit of merri
ment in the eyes that looked through the
gold-rimmed glasses, and acknowledged
that he had been caught in trying to es'
cape unnoticed. I didn't know till after
ward that he has been known to have
his private car sidetracked in order to
escape interviewers.
He said he would talk, but added, "I
have very little to say."
I was prepared to find a modest manâ
a man not given to fuss and feathers or
to going about with a flare of trumpets;
but. such a superlatively modest man,

was not prepared for that.
It was almost time for the noon train
to town and away back somewhere lurked
a suspicion that Mr. Harriman might be
going in. It was best to wait and see.
Presently a party of young girls on
horseback rode up to the Harriman train,
stopped for 'a moment and, rode away
again. A man who had come up just
after them dismounted and walked over
to the special. I hardly noticed him. Nor
did I look twice when, as the incoming
train whistled, he crossed the platform
and went to the ticket windowâ not until
some one standing near said:
"I'll bet I wouldn't pay fare if I was
president of the road."
What! I couldn't believe it till the man
himself had said:
"Yes, I am Mr. Harriman."
"No, he had not returned," was the
colored chef's reply to the same question
half an hour later. " . -. \ . '.'Â¦

And he meant it. He was so honest
about it and so earnest that I began to
wonder if it really is anything to be a
railroad magnate cf the first water, the
head of a multi-millioned syndicate, and
one of the triumvirate of financiers that
practically control the railroads of the
country. Perhaps, after all, this isn't any
bigger than being a butcher or baker or
candlestick-maker.
"Did what? I haven't done anything
yet. Give me a chance to do something
first."
But like one used to bowling over other
people's arguments like so many ten
pins, he toppled mine all down at one fell
swoop:
"Cut it is YOU people want to know
about, and how you did it." I argued, pro
ceeding to range my reasons in front of
him.
But Mr. Harriman doesn't see it that
way. He doesn't see why his personality
is more interesting than that of any other
man. "When I asked him to talk to- me
about himself, he suggested a half a
dozen commonplace things that he
thcught would be better topics.
As a man who began life v.-ith nothing
ar.d at barely middle age is many times a
millionaire, wHh the motive force of many
rat ire millions back of him, he Is a figure
that stands out and demands attention,
whether he likes attention or not.
As president of the Southern Pacific he
is the most interesting man in the coun
try to Californians.
As the head of the Harriman syndicate,
whioh controls eight railroads, with an
Eggiagatc of nearly 25,000 miles and year
ly tarninprs running into the hundreds of
millions, he is one of the most powerful
men in the financial world to-day.

THE little King of Spain is to be
crowned to-morrow.
This Is not the first great cere
mony at which he has been official
ly IT. In fact, during these six
teen years in which he has been coming
of age he has always been holding cen
ter stage in the most elaborate end digni
lied of ceremonies.
The firxt of these took place sixteen
years ago. On the 17th of May. 1SS6, he
was borne into the anteroom of the r-aiace
of Prado, where were assembled the Em
bassadors, the dignitarito of the Spanith
court, the royal attendants, the every
body who was of high enough rank to te
there.
The Prime Minister, Senor Sagasta, bore
him in from the Queen's chamber. The
young King lay upon a silver salver. He
was extremely red and lachrymose. The
ceremony annoyed him and he took no
pains to hide the fact. He was only min
utes old at the time, and he considered it
too socn to take up affairs of state. Those
burdens would come later on.
They are coming now in very truth.
His sixteenth birthday occurs this May,
and on the 5th he will be crowned mon
arch of one of the world's oldest nations.
Sixteen years means a man as Spain has
it in that southern land where youth is
short. V. ,. :
He must take up the duties of that tre
mendous position to which he was born.
He must cease to be a child; he must put
away childish things. He is a king.
A great many people thought that he
would never live to see the day of his
coronation. He was a sick and an un
happy little child.. It was his mother that
brought him to health and saved him for
her pecple.
Queen Christina was a widow at the
time cf hi? birth. She was in need of
comfort, and the baby was dear to her.
And this same lonely and lofty little
person is to be made king to-morrow. You
can study his face from the portrait on
this page, one furnished by JoSe de Oli
vares. Foreign , Commissioner for the
World's Fair of 1903. Can you settle the
question from your study of the face?
the old, old question: Does it pay to be
king?
So sacred was his lonely little person
that only his Asturian nurse and his
governess, outside of his own rank, were
allowed to touch him. There is a story
told of how one attendant was peremp
torily dismissed from service because of
breaking this rule. The little king was
put into a swing in his room and ex -
pected to enjoy himself. Instead of this
he took fright at the height and the
strange motion and get'- up lusty wails.
The devoted attendant rushed to him,
snatched him from the swing and set him
down on terra firma. In walked a court
dignitary, caught hiiri in the act, and dis
charged him in disgrace.
She it was who nursed him through all
his sickness and has made a man 'of him.
He is said to be in fair health and of ex
treme intelligence. He is old for his
years; this comes of his lonely life. There
was never another royal child for him to
play with and he was allowed no lesser
companions, so he had to play with
grown people and pretend they were chil
dren.
But when she presented Spain with a
King, Spain decided to take her into its
heart. They loved their little king and
they loved his mother, and* they have
continued to do so.
Her husband had died and left her lone
ly; the people of Spain did not love her
because they did not know her. She had
been a' -stranger to. them when she mar
ried King Alfonzo XII, .- and . she 'had no
gift for making friends because of her
natural reserve. She always wanted - to

these two years have robbed him of all

He teaches a little, plays a little. Just

Â«=jpi HE holy coat preserved at Trevea,

jl seamless garment worn by Chri3t

tunic, about five feet long, cut narrow at
the shoulders and gradually widening
toward the knees. Many miracles are
said to have been performed by this robe.
Its history for the last 700 years is clear
enough, but darkness shrouds the story
of the relic prior to the twelfth century.
The Catholic church relies for proof of
its authenticity upon a tradition that it
was one of a chestful of relics sent as a
gift to the church at Treves by the Em
press Helena. She is said to have found

on the bark Ingomar, with a cargo of ma-

skipper he was that ever let a ship's crew

She has lately come to San Francisco,
and although she has adopted our style
of dress, as tlo all of her countrymen upon
reaching our coast, nevertheless, she now
and then dor.s a kimono that she brought
along in her bundle and dances for auld
lang ?yne.
Remember, she is no geisha girl. She
would have you understand that and
most, emphatically so. There are plenty
of geisha girls in San Francisco who
know Japanese dances, but not the kind
that little Miss Iki knows. Hers are the
classical dances, the pantomime dances,
handed down from generation to genera
tion from time immemorial. The songs
that go with them tell the stories of the
pantomimes and are part of the ancient
literature of Japan. San Francisco has
â¢jevcr before seen or heard anything of
the hind.
Miss Iki learned her dances In a select
class of young ladies under the charge of
;.n experienced teacher in one of the small
towns whervp ehe iived. near Tokio. In the
teacher's own bamboo house these young
liudies went through the â¬teps.and the
gestures while a samisen player played
a::J chanted an accompaniment.
The dances are all pantomimes, each
one telling some classical story belonging
to the mythical history of the land. One
is the story of the -two brothers whose
father was killed and their avenging his
death. Little Miziu tells this tale In a
pantomime fiance with the aid of a sword.
"The Flowers of Four. Seasons" Is the
name of the dance shown In pictures on
this page. It is In reality a series of
poses' made to picture the parts of the
.story as it moves along. It lells the story
of the year with its changes from the
opening *>f spring to the snows of winter.
The song belongs to the oldest and most
classical of Japanese literature and is as
elusively untranslatable as all of those
classics are. We can -follow the thread of
the season story, but there .are certain fine
meanings that escape us every time when
,we try to render them into our language.
The introduction explains that the
singer is looking out over a field from
his place on the mountain above and
watching the on-coming of the flowers.
The dancer follows the words of the song,
going through her gestures and motions
to represent the changes.
The first part of the dance tells the
story of the spring, and the fan used is
closed. This stands for the unopened
buds of the season. More than this, there
is a sort of personification running
through the story. The change of the
year symbolizes the change of life and
love. For this "Four Seasons" is the love
song of the language, something that
stands for love idealized. But this phase
of the meaning Is too delicate for our
anything else, though Ben Wicks shook
his head and did a heap of mumbling un
der his breath. And we certainly begin
to have a- queer voyage. We was on a
nor' nor'east tack and we had a purty
fair breeze most of the time, but some
how that ship seemed to make mighty
little headway. The sea was a dirty oil
color and it seemed to sort of ketch hold
of us and stick on. It was like sailing
through molasses.
" Ut ? s coming soon,' said Ben Wicks, one

of hearing.

" 'What kind of looking woman was it?"

bulls bellowing and it was Teague calling
to the man at the wheel.

around she swunsr.

'and mind your eye.'

and began to freshen and Inside of two

make no explanations. Then he went up
Into the bow and took his seat In the
knighthead.
"For seven days that fair breeze lasted
and for seven days we went clipping

Teague set up there on the knighthead
looking forward, out over the sea. We
passed ship; and then got past the trav

"But on that seventh day we raised a.
speck on the horizon and Teague Jumped
to his feet when he seen it. We come up
to it In the first dog watch. She was
what was left of a fine schooner, her
masts gone and laying so low in "the
water her decks was partly awash.

It was his first words sense he'd turned

"I was in the yawl's crew. They was a

" 'Deadâ under yon tarpaulin,' says one
of the men. 'Poor little woman. Barker

" 'God be praised/ says Teague. In a.
quiet voice that shook that waterlogged

"Teague went over, pulled thÂ« tarpaulin
oft and picked the woman that was lying
under it up in his two hands. They said
afterward that she'd been dead thxea

" 'Some brandy here-^-thls woman's

"They passed him a flask out of do

as I hope for mercy, the woman's eyelids

Teague, as I live, set there swelling up

DANCAtrated tha^ his only answer was to throw,
himself di^wn upon his blanket on the
floor, where he immediately fell asleep.
She herself took the horse and tied it to
a tree near the spring. Some time later
he was awakened by hearing a white
man's voice. It was Temple, who had
tracked his horse. .Ramona says he went
directly to the house, calling as- he went.
Her husband came to the door, only to be
met by a volley of oaths and the leveling
of the gun, and the. next moment- a shot
was fired and he fell dead across his own
On the other hand Temple says that
when ' he Â¦ came to the ridge overlooking
the house and 'saw his horse there he
called out and that Juan Diego, came to
meet him. Ashe came he noticed he had
a long knife so held in his hand that the
blade was up his sleeve. ' "Where' did you
get i that : horse?" "he asked. "From the
corral of the Senor .Hewitt," was the
reply. -j
"Don't you know' that horse isn't

one knew he was there, many , knew
where he livedâ to track him would be an
easy task.
As to .what occurred at the house there
aro two 'versionsâ one given by Ramona
herself and which is practically the same
as related in the book; the other by Sam
Temple, the Jim Farrar of the novel, and
the owner of the black horse ' that Juan
Diego took.
Ramona says that when her husband
arrived home on a strange horse she was
terrified with fear, as she knew how
horse-stealing by an Indian .would be re
garded, but her husband was in such an
exhausted condition that he could' give
her no satisfaction as to how he gained
the horse. She begged him to return with
it to the Hewett corral and there seek Its
owner, but 'he was so completely' pros>-
doorstep." Temple tnen took his revolver
from his pocket and fired three more
shots into the clead body, of her husband,
unfastened his horse and immediately
rode away.'

But like all whist rules, there are excep
tions, when it is best not to return part
ner's lead, such as: Firstâ When you wish
to lead trumps for your own or partner's
suit. Secbndâ When you" hold a suit
headed by a sequence of three high cards,
such 'as' ace,' king, queen, or king, queen,
jack, or queen, jack, ten, ; which will evi
dently be more easily established than
your partner's suit. Thirdâ When you
win the first round of your partner's suit
cheaply, as . with ten, ; nine or smaller
card. In this case . your partner holds
either the major or minor tenace, ana
your right-hand adversary. the other, and
to return the suit would give the oppo
i nent the advantage of the position.
Fourthâ When the partner has opened a
short suit, to return it is usually about
the worst thing you can do, for there
' again you give the opponents the advan
tage of position.- Fifthâ When 'both ad
versaries "are > void of the suit, to lead it
would allow the adversary who is weak in
trumps to ruff and 'Â¦ the other to discard
I a -losing card.' To give i your adversaries
a discard and the, weak hand a chance to
The situation in which a player is jus
tified in opening his own suit with a small
card is so rare that the inference should
be, when a player does opan his suit with
a small card, that he is void of his part
ner's suit.. It is, as a rule, very much
better to return partner's suit than to
change to even a fairly strong suit, say
ace, king and two small, for If you open
this suit, leading king, then ace, you give
up control and may establish it for the
adversary, besides parting with what
might] prove to be a valuable card of re
entry.
With any ordinary trump strength in
the hand of either this can often be
done, and an established suit is a good
thing to have : when trumps are out. The
more you " investigate and reason the
subject the ,. more "strange it will seem
that any such play as showing your own
suit first. can be regarded with favor. In
returning partner's suit it is imperative
that you should return the master card
if you hold it, or second best, if you
have both second or. third best, or other
wise, lead the highest of the two remain
ing, or the lowest of three remaining.
How often have we seen a player sit
and hesitate, fingering first one card
and then another, in doubt as to the
of returning his partner's
ruit'pr opening another.
'^.'Ttie old idea used to be to open your
own suit first when winning 'a trick in a
suit led by your partner.
' 'The time has passed when players pos
sessing average whist judgment have any
idea that two suits can be established
at i the same time; that Is, your part
ner's suit and your own. In fact, to at
tempt it is' considered as a rule the
greatest of folly. And as your partner
has already started to 'establish his, you
will in most cases do better by trying to
aid -him in establishing his suit than
starting off on a new one. When you do
not return your partner's suit you vir
tually tell him that your suit can be
r.iore easily established than his own
and you thereby assume the responsibility
cf the change. The main Idea of a long
suit opening is to " establish the suit so
that if the trumps are .. exhausted the
suit may be made. ' .
THE continual . changing of suits is
one of the most .common methods
of losing tricks, and I do not be
lieve the subject has been given
the. attention it deserves. There
are many players of ordinary ability who
are continually. losing tricks in this man
ner because they do not realize that
with but*, few, exceptions new; suits are
opened at a disadvantage.

EASY LESSONS IN WHIST
North's hand is from actual play, but.
as : a matter of fact, at trick -five (after
administering the one force) he led ace,
then jack of trumps, whereupon west
cleaned up the remalnedr and brought in
three diamonds. North, knowing south to
hold a club, felt Justified In discarding
both "spades and brought, in two 'clubs.
But even under these favorable drcum- i
stances north and ' south only scored the
odd trick after allowing for the fortu
nate trick â¢ in the spade suit. Therefore
the loss of one trick still remains attri
butable to the over-confident; tramp lead. s
Trick 11. South's lead here is difficult.
The regulation lead from ace and small
one is, of course, the ace, but general
rules do not apply so late in hand.
South knows north has two spades. .If!
one is the king, south's play does not
matter; or, again, if east has the king;
it is bound to make, and south cannot;
lose anything by keeping the ace till tho
second round. The lead of the losing;
trump would be futile, since if; east
holds king and small spada, he
will lead small, and south dare not
pass the trick in view of thÂ» rlak of i
west's winning and leading: his , thir
teenth diamond. So south plays In the
hope of finding' the king of spades on his
left, and queen with north. In which case,
even If west should play in the king, south
must still make his ace or trump.
Trick 9. The ace. If led, will probably
be more effective to Injure the adversary
or assist partner than If held In hand.
Trick 6. West, after the doubla force,
can do nothing but go on with thÂ» dia
monds. North gets in his little trump.
Trick 7. North still steadfastly decline*
to lead spades or trumps.
Trick 8. And wins with a second losing
trump.
trump is far Â¦ Worse ' than changing suits.

Trick 1. West's hands would tempt
many players to make a peculiar trump
opening, but his paucity of clubs should
be a sufficient deterrent.
Trick 2. North should not lead out dla- j
mond ace to get a ruff, but keep com- ;
mand of adverse suit, and proceed to j
open the clubs. The fall of the king |
shows that west can ruff next round.
Trick 3. But that does not deter north
from continuing the suit.
Trick 5. North knows south has the six
of clubs, and that it is probably his only
card of the suit. But It Is better to con- j
tinue than to lead the queen of spades.

less accompanied by the jack, is one of
the- worst possible plays.

IS there a real Ramona?
This is the question the tourists ask
again and again after they have wept
and read over Helen Hunt Jaackson's
masterpiece, and though the ques
tion is often asked and as often answered,
the answers arc as varied and as far
from the facts as they can well.be.
Ramona the book is a novel. Ramona
the heroine therefore is a fiction, a crea
ture of the imagination, a being that
never did exist except in the mind of the
author. And yet there is such a wonder- -
ful amount of fact woven into the woof !
of the fictitious story that it takes one {
well versed in the history of Southern \
California to tell which is fact and which j
is fiction.
It is really a wonderful mosaic, made j
up of tiny pieces of fact and fiction so
skillfully dovetailed together as to de- Â¦
ceivc all but the very best informed.
For over a dozen years I have been dili
gently sorting out fact from fiction, and
many interesting things have come under
my ken. One of these is the fact that
there is a real Ramona connected with
the story, and that "she is yet alive. She Â¦
is the heroine of that portion of the novel :
that describes the killing of Alessandro,
and the story as related by "H. H." is >
exactly that told by Ramona herself. This j
woman, however, is a pure blooded In- :
Oian. There is not a drop of white blood
in her veins. Her maiden name was Ra
mona Lubo, and she was born and
brought up at Cahuilla, the Indian village
in the San Jacinto mountains, so truth
fully described by Mrs. Jackson. Hero
felifc fell in love with and ultimately mar
ried Juan Diego, 'an Indian of the same
village and people. He was .a fairly in- j
dustrious felloe*, but owing to some mis- ]
hap occasionally suffered from a tern-'
porary aberration of mind, commonly J
termed by the whites of the San Jacinto :
region "locoed." During these fits of
"loco" Juan would do strange and unac
countable things, but every one knew him -
and overlooked what in others would
have been severely condemned.
That Juan was not lazy- is evidenced by
the fact that he left Cahuilla, after pros
pecting around, and located on a piece of
land in a secluded canyon on the south
side of the Cahuilla Mountains, some five
miles from his boyhood's home. Here, by
the side of a small spring, he built an
adobe house. Close by he planted a peach
orchard, dug a reservoir and did consid
erable work. For awhile the young "cou
ple lived here in happiness and conjugial
content. He who deems the Indian a
stranger to these things Is guilty of a
lamentable want of knowledge. In due
time a child was born to Juan and Ra
mona. The parents rejoiced in the child
and was consequently terror-stricken'
when she was taken sick. After using all
the simple remedies with which they
were familiar they decided that Juan
should leave home to go to the agency
physician, who then lived in San Ber
nardino. Riding his poor, scraggy pony,
his love and fears urging him to the
greatest speed, be reached the office of
the physician, who refused point-blank to
go and see the child, but sent some
medicine instead. Without waiting for
rest or sleep Juan started on his return
journey. He got as far as Old San Ja
cinto, where a xaa.it named Hewett had a
store, a stable and a corral where Indian
and whites alike were in the habit of
meeting. The housekeeper here was
Mrs. Jordan, the original of the
"Aunt Ri" of the novel, and 'to
her Juan told the story of his
child's illness. He was so worn out
that the kindly hearted woman urged him
to unsaddle his bronco and sleep for a
few hours. Yielding to her persuasions
he did so, but, awaking very early, he
went out into the corral to get his animal
and resume his journey.
And now comes the place in the story
where two explanations are offered of
Juan's actions, according to the way one
is inclined to view the Indian. As to the
facts there can be no dispute and they
are these: Instead of saddling his own
broken-down and wretched nag he found
a fine black horse in the corral upon
which he threw his saddle, and in a few
moments vsm speeding to his mountain
home, forty miles away, where his sick
child lay.
Juan's friends Kay that when he did this
he was "locoed." He had no ! more
thought in liis mind of stealing the black
horse than be had of flying. Wearied with
his Ions ride, tortured by his fears, an
gered at the rcfus.il of the physician to
go to see his Â«Ji>riI:;s;. distressed lest that

Little. Brown & Co. of Boston have re
cently brought out a new edition of that
splendid old French romance, "Cinq
Mars," by Alfred de Vigny. It still well
deserves, and will hold, the same hlgtf
position that it took when first published
in 1S26, when it went through four editions
within three years. It is a story that
tells of deeds and men during the time
of Richelieuâ that period that Dumas has,
made so familiar to us. Beyond the time
and people, the similarity between the
writings of Dumas and M.- de Vigny
ceases. M. de Vigny's work is. strong in
character drawing and in absolute fidelity
to historical facts. In "Cinq Mars." his
portraitures of Richelieu. Louis XIII and
Anne of Austria, are splendidly done. The
book - is rather lacking in the passages
of lighter vein that add so much to the
writings of Dumas, but as a romance it
is really most powerful. } The translation
has been done by William Hazlitt, with
scholarly exactness and care. '. Aa- a his

The fascinating and puzzling uncertain
ty of the case Is well sustained until the
last page of the book, and "The Hound
of the Baskervilles" Is a novel that once
begun will not hi put aside until it has
been finished.
After the death of Sir Charles the estate
goes to his next of kin, a nephew who is
living in America and who comes to Bas
kerville Hall to take charge as Sir Henry
Baskerville. He receives a warning in a
mysterious manner that living at Basker
ville Hall will prove his doom, but he is
a man of courage and decides to take the
risk. Thus it is that Holmes has the dou
ble task of protecting the living as well
as solving the mystery of the. death of
Sir Charles. He soon finds that he his
his hands full aiid that he has at last met
a foeman worthy of his steel.
Mr. Doyle puts the superstition to good
account, and at times the reader is not
sure whether after all the affair will not
turn out to be a "true" ghost story; it
is only the 'faith that we have in the cold,
keen and practical mind of Holmes that
keeps us confident that In the end the
weird happenings at Baskerville HaU'will
be explained.
Another point that seemed to bear out
the possibility that his death had come
about through the curse of the Basker
villes was the fact that near his body
were to be plainly seen the footprints of
a gigantic hound. Of course, this evi
dence of such a material nature, while at
once suggesting the old legend, dealt
rather a blow to the possibility of a super
natural agency entering in as a factor
in the investigation of the case.

do to add variety to the life of that

B^ainst those of the amateur cracksman
"Raffles." a name that E. W. Hornung
has made equally famous among the
readers of detective fiction. If Mr. Horn
ung and Dr. Doyle could arrange a trial
hunt between their two heroes we should
have some "deductions" and "counter
plots" that would make the greatest de
tective work ever put in print. It would
have to be understood that both gentle
men should spare the life of the other's
hero, but this would he no hardship to
cither of them, for neither is anymore
"sanguinary than is absolutely necessary
to give proper ''human interest" to their
stories.
Raffles is the only man alive in the
fiction of to-day who could puzzle the re
doubtable Holmes; he is the one criminal
who could lead the detective a merry
dance, and it would be odds even as to
whether Holmes would catch Raffles or
Rallies take Holmes. At any rate that is
something: that the public would like to
have settled; who is the better man? Let
the writers toss up for the authorship of
the first chapter and then alternate in
the writing of each successive one. The
great difficulty would be that the book
would never end. for neither Holmes nor
Raffles is a man to ever admit defeat,
and the successes of one v.-ould have t->
be met by the rebuffs of the other.
That v.ould be the book of the yearâ
Rafiles and "Bunny" pitted against Sher
lock Holmes and Dr. Watsonâ and then
let the best man win'.
When Dr. Doyle tumbled his hero over
an Alpine pass anfl apparently ended his
career of greatness there was a wail from
the great majority of Holmes* admirers,
who took this as his final appearance in
any of life's dramas. It was said at the
time that Dr. Doyle had tired of Invent
ing situations and unraveling plots and
that he ha<J decided in cold blood to a-Â»
away with his man for good and all. '<â¢â¢
thought better of this decision, if he ever
made it. and last year it was given forth
th:it Sherlock Kclmes should once again
take the boards to unravel the greatest
rnyvtery of !Vc3J all, "The Hound of the
BaskerviUeK."
The story was published in The Strand
to London and now it appears in book
form in America from the publishing
lxvse M McClure. Phillips & Co., New-
York. This book throws no light on the
IK>*sible ending of the affair in the Alps
and it is left to the reader" ii>iniagination
to satisfy himself whether this is an ad
ver.ture "prior to that disastrous wiid
goose flight across the continent and
tumble over the mountains, or whether
Holmes saved his neck in some miracu
lous v.-ay and is still alive for more ex- "
periences new and startling.
At any rate the publishing of this new
story now leaves the way clear for Dr.
Doyle to give us as many more farewell
appearances of Mr. Holmes as his own
sweet will and fancy may dictate â a situ
tion most agreeable to the many readers
who followed with delight the former
varied and startling adventures of the
great man as recorded in the past stories
of "A Study in Scarlet," "The Sign, of

"The Hound of the Baskervilles" is the

one that puts even the great detective on

The curee of the Baskervilles lies in the
fleed of old Hugo Baskerville over a cen
tury before Ihe time of the present story.
It eeems that he was one of the worst of
the very worst and bis wickedness, as
Is recited In an ancient manuscript of the
time, brought about the persecution of
tha hell-hound that is supposed to blast
the fortunes of every succeeding > male
Baskerville who attempts to live on the
old estate. Part of this manuscript reads
in this wise:
"It chanced that this Hugo came to love
(If, Indeed, so dark a passion may be
, known under so bright a name) the
daughter of a yeoman who held lands
near the Baskerville estate. But the
young maiden, being discreet and of good
repute, would ever avoid him, for she
feared his evil name. So it came to pass
that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with five
or six of his Idle and wicked companions,
stole down upon the farm and carried off
the maiden, her father and brothers be
ing from home, as he well knew. When
they had brought her to the Hall the
:nafden was placed in an upper chamber,
while Hugo and his friends sat down to
a long carouse, as was their nightly cus
tom."
The girl managed to make her escape
by climbing down the ivy on the side of
the house. This fact was soon discovered
by the drink-maddened Hugo, and in
crazy mood he swore tnat he would that
night render his soul to the powers of
evil if he couid but overtake the girl. One
of the men more drunken, than the rest
cried out to put the bounds upon her. and
forthwith out went the drunken band in
hot haste on their hellish hunt.
The result of it was that Hugo distanced
all his valiant retainers.
"They had gone a mile or two when they
passed one of the night shepherds upon
the moorlands, and they cried to him to
know If he had seen the hunt. And the
man, as the story goes, was so crazed
with fear that he could scarce speak, but
at last he said that he had indeed seen
the unhappy maiden, with the hounds
upon her track. "But 1 have seen more
than that,* said he. 'for Hugo Basker
Â¦\Jlle passed me upon his black mare, and
c there ran mute behind him such a hound
of heH as God forbid should ever be at
my heels.' " -^
The majority of the revelers turned
back, almost frightened out of their wits,
but three of the boldest and most drunken
of the party rode on.
The moon was shining bright upon the
clearing.- and there in the center lay the
unhappy maid, where she had fallen dead

The Theater for May, handsome In ap
pearance as usual, devotes considerable
spacÂ£ to a discussion of the proposed en
dowed theater. The editor wrote to tha
leading players, dramatists and literary
workers asking for their views on tha
subject, and he prints their replies. Tha
fifty-odd answers include interesting let
ters from Joseph Jefferson. Julia Mar
lcwe. E. H. Sothern, E. M. Holland, Mrs.
Leslie Carter, Reginald de Koven, Otis
Skinner, Ella Wheeler Wllcox, Da Wolf
Hopper, Eugene W. Presbrey, Kyrla Bel
low, Wilton Lackaye. John Malone, Mar
tha Morton and others. The general opin
ion seems to be that there Is a great need
in New York for an ideal theater, and' the
name of Helnrich Conrled la put forward
by most as the man best fitted to con
duct such a theater. Another important
feature in the issue Is an article on "The
Passion Play in America," by a prom
inent clergyman. The writer, the Rev.
Percy S. Grant, rector of the Church of
the Ascension. New York, takes the lib
eral view, which he thinks is that of
many church members, that there would
be no impropriety in presenting tha sa
cred story on the local stage If properly
done. He does not think it would cheap
en the Christian religion, but says that,
on the contrary, Christian people must
not shut their eyes to anything which
tends to give greater reality to the story
of Christ through fear It will shake their
faith. Cleveland Moffett contributes an
interesting study, with striking portraits.

stage celebrity of the hour, and an en

portraits of the players now before the

Richard Harding Davis, like most suc
cessful authors, had his days of grind and
uphill effort before he finally found him
self in "Van Bibber," "The Princess
Aline" and all the rest. He had the usual
trials of a man who starts out to do
newspaper work, and yet who has dis
tinct literary aspirations. The editor who
passed on Davis' reportorial- copy said
that the hardest work he had was to re
move tiie "literary touch" from Davis'
reports, and he finally said, "For heaven's
sake, Diqk, remember that you are writ
ing for a newspaper and not for Harper's
Magazine."
Not long afterward Mr. Davis was
writing considerably for the Harpers, and
their editors then had to grapple with the
problem of how to get the journalistic
idiom out of Mr. Davis* extraordinarily
clever literary work. All of which was
rather wearing on the aspiring young
author.
"The Anthology of Russian Litera
ture," to be published by the Putnam3
in 1902, will meet a definite want. It will
give extracts, but more often complete
productions from all writers who have
had an important part in the development
of Russian letters from the earliest times
up to the present. These extracts will
be accompanied by biographical and such
critical and textual notes as will make
each author comprehensible without ref
erence to any other work. The introduc
tion will be a resume of the whole his
tory of Russian literature, and will con
tain everything necessary to serve as a
thorough guide to that study, from the
historical, critical and bibliographical
standpoints.
The May. number of Everybody's Maga
zine opens with an article by Dr. Henry
Gannett on "Famous American Moun
tains"" illustrated with photographs of
the notable peaks of the Rockies, tha
Sierras and the Alaskan range. Especial
ly timely Is T. P. O'Connor's estimate of
Cecil Rhodes, the "Napoleon of South Af
rica." It is a skillful character study,
representing the curious admixture -of
traits which made Mr. Rhodes the great
personality of his period. Another valu
able contribution is â¢ Dr. H. W. Wiley's
"Man as a Machine," in which the func
tions of the human body are compared
with mechanical processes.
Plctorially the feature of tha May

moods and attitudes. These etchings
have never before /been published, and
only a limited - number of proofs were
printed, and they offer characteristic ver
sions of an artist whose personality and
accomplishments are truly unique. The
etchings will be printed In tint and will
be accompanied by an introductory paper
by Christian Brinton entitled "Mr. Men

liotl has just had finished. This is no
mere bit of.jewelrythat.may.be worn
upon all occasions with acy toilets. On
the contrary, as its very name implies,
it is a ring that is made first and for
which the dress to be worn with it is de
signed afterward.
This particular ring is a single bar of
sold over two Inches long that reaches
from the- knuckle to the first joint of the
linger. It is set with three huge diamonds
of. the first water, all faultlessly cut to
precisely the same size.
The dress that inust be worn with this
unique jewel is of black velvet powdered
lightly with heavy gold dust. It is cut
decollete, with long tight-fitting sleeves
that come down well over the hands.
That is "all. There is no other ornamen
tation of any kind anywhere, but against
such a rich dark background wherever
the hand of the lucky possessor may
move the new "dress" ring glitters with
a wondrous radlanct. ; '-
Another Idea which is as fascinatlnglj
original as it is beautifully becoming la
an evening dress, also of black velvet
with the front of the corsage cut in the
shape of a huge butterfly's wings, from
the center of which rise two slender gold
threads to represent the long wispy feel
ers of the insect, on the end of each ut
which' there is a large diamond shimmer
ing tantalizingly with even the slightest
motion of the wearer.
Another toilet which is more simple
than either of the other two Just de
scribed is made distinctive by a sing!a
rope - of diamonds running across th*
bosom from the right shoulder to the left
armpit.
Still another magnificent jewel is an
immense heart-shaped locket as big as
a pear, heavily incrusted with diamond
which Is to -be worn with any toiler
hanging at the end of a long rope of
pearls studded at Intervals with dia
monds.

local stage.
It is adorable. Its possibilities ': are In

will adorn anew one. It .will save the
price and the trouble of gloves. Above
all. it has more powers of coquetry, than
the fan or the parasol, and what a clever'
woman can't do with it won't be worth
doing: :< â¢* :
Of course -It is an ornament. Nobody
ever supposed, it is to be hoped, that it
was meant to keep the handswarm. But
it is bewitching when made to match a
reception or, ball gown. Miss Conklin's
muff in the picture goes with a* reception
gown of rose pink. The muff is' made of
lhe fluffiest white. chiffon, ruffled with it,
ruched^with It; a, long streamer of the â¢'
chiffon trails Â¦ from it. The lining ', is , of
the daintiest of rose-tinted satin.

They cover, it. ' ., They are the most nat
ural of pink. roses, with. green leaves, and
they are fastened in a great cluster that
covers the muff. Another, a smaller knot
of them, is caught into the long streamer.

Then there Is a large American flag to
be worn in the corsage, which is nothing
short of a masterpiece .in design and ex
ecution. It is shaped to take on the long
undulating motion of the stars and stripes
floating in thfe wind, and on the slightest
movement of the fair wearer under the
electric lights it will seem to be con-
Â¦etantly a-flutter. It is made of gold two

one-half inches high, and i set witb dia
monds to represent the thirteen . original
stars, and a field-.of diamonds, sapphires
and rubies In alternating 'â¢ rows - for the
stripes. It is safe to say that in all the
brilliancy- of coronation week there will
be no jewel more beautiful in 1 conception.
But the height of originality, is 'shown

risen to a. position that is unique. Her
4cttractiv<'i:Â« b* is greater than ever be

her coiffure to a coquettish side part,
which has= softened what some have Jwil

a beauty that is distinctively, impulsive

AMERICAN
BEAUTY'S
SPLENDOR
FOR
CORONATION
WEEK. There are gowns so ; very much like
coats that only a person well versed in
children's clothes would know that they
really were not intended as such. They
are made of white pique. There is a. tiny
stiff collar and the dress hooks directly
down the front, -which is unusual in lit
tle people's clothes. The only thing that
breaks the monotony are two little ex
tensions of the pique that hold large
pearl buttons. About the shoulders is a
collar edged with deep embroidery and
the finishing touch Is added by a white
leather belt that is held In place with a
gold buckle. It is one of the most com
plete of all frocks and looks well under
all circumstances.

Did you happen to know that little iliaa
Modish' s frocks are lined and interlined?
Well, they are. One designed for dancing
school is made of organdy.. The skirt and
waist are tucked round and without â¢>
particle of lace. The sleeves are snort
and the neclc Is round, giving It an air
of evening dress. A ruffle of the material
forms a bertha and a tiny edge of Valen
ciennes is all the trimming there Is. But
the underskirt is mare elaborate than th*
outside one. It is a mass of tucks and Is
finished with a knife pleating edged with,
lace. The pleating stands cut iauntfly,
and when the short ekirt flies looks as
though the gown had Been really Â«nd
truly finished.

you please.. If. you like it in the back, all

White Is supposed to be the popular
color for small . girls'. But do not buy a
white cloak nor a white hat. Anything
else will be chic, but black moire is the
'only thing ' that is considered swell; and
that is well, simply howling swell.
, These coats are made just long enough
to cover' the knees, and. are supposed to
entirely cover the dress. They are double
breasted and frequently have a V-shaped
piece .of tucked taffeta that fits closely
.about the throat. Instead of a wide!col
lar of the moire, a heavy ecru lace one Is
more often seen, as It- takes away, the
somber look. These little V-shaped pieces
that are. more often worn than not are
made of black. and white, sometimes the
two come with the coat. They are either
stitched ]ot are tucked all over. That
' corr.es in to : great advantage when the
slip ',â¢ does ': not â¢' correspond with the â¢ coat."
The same idea is carried out in pink
chiffon, but not exactly In the French
shape. This one is a bat and does not
tie under the chin; it does not even boast
of Strings. A large bow of black velvet
ribbon sits jauntily on the crown .arid
matches the black moire cloak to . a
nicety. y
Another natty hat Is made of chiffon
in a pale blue. It is fashioned after, the
French bonnet, only it is much larger. It
fits closely about the head and ears and
ties under the chin with an immense bow
of blue. There are rows and rows of
pleated chiffon that puffs. about the face
prettily, 1 and, a band of ribbon â¢ held in
plaice with a few steel buckles adds a
swagger finish.- A spidery bow of the
blue is all that ornaments the crown,
and, in fact, is all that could be placed
there, as it is very small.

each row is headed with a piece of nar
row black velvet ribbon. On the crown
there is' absolutely nothing but a bunch
of Bprawly marguerites tied with their
own stems. Falling' here and there ara
several stray ones that look as though
they had slipped their bounds and were
prying into their neighbor's business. It
is one of the sweetest hats that has been
turned out for a child this year, and If
you wanted to buy it would probably
make you play a sweet tune.
Children really lcok better if ribbon is
used instead of silk. A soft satin ribbon
about six inches wide is about as nobby
as anything else. Taffeta is glossy and
makes a nifty bow, but. it crushes too
quickly and hangs like a wilted flower.
The soft satin, particularly the wash rib-.
Sashes, by the way, are all the vogm
for everybody. It makes no difference
whether your grandmother wore it; how
wide or how narrow it is; what its color
is, or what it is made of, so, long as it
deserves the name of sash it is abso
lutely correct
Another charming slip is fashioned of
white batiste. The deep-tucked blouse
has a full ruffle bordered' with embroi
dered batiste and headed with a cluster
of tucks. The yoke is a mass of tucks
and insertion and it is draped with a lace
bertha. The waist is finished with a sash,
and what could be prettier?

scalloped lace revere collar opens ove:
a tucked yoke; at the bottom it has a
double lace-edged ruffle, the upper one
trimmed with three tucks, gauged to fit
the tucks in the waist. The sleeves are
bishops with lace cuffs?, sewed in tucks at
the upper part. It is just the fluffiest, fly
away thing that could be devised, and
when worn with a large picture hat of
soft pink chiffon a pretty child looks like
a fairy that has just come to visit us
for a while and who intends to leave us
marveling.
Lately she was about to lead a second
husband to the altar, when the word "di
vorced" broke the spell of love. The
lady took.: an 'action agaln st the registrar,
on the ground that In her maiden name
she had not been divorced and that her
piofcssion was not that of a divorced
lady. The Supreme Court has upheld the
objection, and the registrar has been com
pelled to make a new entry.
"Will not that be very misleading^" it
was asked, "it may be." was the reply,
"if the would-be husband fancies that wo
guarantee anything but the fact that her
maiden name is or was X. He must find
out the other facts for himself. A Prus
sian registrar is not a matrimonial
agent." SSOHRf
A curious case has recently been de
cided. A pretty young spouse was di
vorced from her husband because she had
allowed herself to be hypnotized and
while in that state made divers grievous
mistakes as to the identity of certain
people. Her former lord when divorced
forbade her to, sign or otherwise use his
name any longer, whereupon she reas
suroed her maiden name and informed the
registrar of her decision. Thi3 official an
tered her as "Divorced X."
IN Germany It has until recently been
the custom of divorced women
to wear or discard their former hus
bands' names, as suited them best.
A new law on the subject has, however,
just gone into effect. Under its provisions
a divorced wife may use her late hus
band's name unless and until he makes a
declaration, which costs nothing, to tha
effect that he withdraws from her the
right to bear it. Of course, this declara
tion can be made only by one whose own
behavior was irreproachable. If there
were faults on both sides, the lady can
call herself by the surname she possessed
ever since her marriage. Â»

I is ai' absorbing. She Is every whit
I as Interesting as her big sister, or.
| perchance, her mother.
For youngsters these days art
not wha-t they used to be. Lon^j
years ago a little miss had a simple slip
r^iide of bright red calico or a dark blue
diess. She wore that day after day an-I
wntm more than happy when she slid down
a tree and tore it into rags, or when she
accidentally hung over the well and camo
out as wtt as a drowned rat-
Dress was the least of her troubles.
Play was her life.
But these days it is different. Very.
There arc all kinds of fancy frocks for
every time; and, more to the point, they
are worn and -considered really necessary
to the happiness of a well-behaved chil.1.
If colored frocks are worn at all it is
in the morning and they are made of
dimity or some other sheer material, and
are trimmed with embroidery or lace.
They are rarely simple. For the afternoon
white is the , proper thing, unless the
gown be of a heavy material and then
almost any color is permissible and con
sicertd quite right.
But, after all, white is the only thing
for a little miss to wear. It seems so
much more childlike, so much sweeter
and so much daintier. Black was never
meant for them; that is. to be used on
anything other than cloaks.
A smart frock for the little lady of
three or four is the Lorlie. It is of lawr.
and is as a rule worn over a white slip.
The full skirt is gathered three or four
times at the yoke, the gathers being suffi
ciently far apart to admit of puffs be
tween. The sleeve is a full bishop, with
a frill formed by the extension of its own
fullness over the hand. It is entirely a
matter of choice whether one has the
two ruffles of embroidery that fall over
the shoulder, or whether the skirt has a
band of insertion that encircles it, but
the open work white certainly adds more
than a little to the frock. However, as
many believe in dressing little people In
the extreme of simplicity, a plain lawn
made in such a fashion Is, to say the
least, attractive.
An exquisite gown is made of dotted
lawn. The material comes with dots at
regular intervals, and it is wide enough
to make a number of tucks and finally
end with a dotted scalloped embroidery.
A ekirt made with as many tucks as
are necessary and made very full is just
about as pretty and sensible as can be
found for a child. A deep yoke of all
over embroidery and sleeves of the same
keep up the embroidered appearance.
There is not a part of the frock that is
made of the plain lawn, as there is
usually enough of the materials left over
to make the tiny piece that is needed in
the back and front. While this little
gown sounds terribly elaborate and per
haps rather fussy, it really is not so. Re
member the material i s lawn, and while
it has a dot in it, it does not seem so
much dressed up. It makes as dainty an
afternoon frock as any one could possibly
desire, and yet it does not give that fold
your-hand-and-keep-quiet feeling.
For cool days the Columbia costume has
been especially designed. It is made of
mohair or serge, but preferably the for
mer. It has the wide, turned-over sailor
collar, which trims the back of the frock
admirably. The skirt, which is . quite
short, is circular and has two backward
plaits at the middle of the back. Other
than several rows of stitching or bands
of narrow braid it is plain. What pleases
the mothers most Is that It is neither too
plain nor too elaboiale; It has reached the
exalted place of a happy medium.

LITTLE MISS MODISH AND HOW SHE
DRESSESChildren \ should not be allowed to sit
still long for a time; if they do they will
fidget, move restlessly from side to side
and take attitudes which may make
them grow crooked. No stooping lesson,
such as writing or drawing, should end
without some simple arm exercise. Ac

A child's bedroom should have plenty
of windows for the sunshine to enter,
and a generous open hearth. It should be
large and high-ceiled, with no papers
on the walls to < atch floating gases, but
finished instead "with some non-absorbent
material. Tbejre, should be hard- wood
floors, with rugs, instead of carpets/ and.
few hangings and little bric-a-brao: and
the child should spend, except when
sleeping, as little time in it as practica
ble. It should be worth a generous fe*
to the architect to perfect the ventilation
of a child's bedroom. From ten to twelve
hours' sleep, a. child is six or seven
years old. is necessary; and he should
sleep by himself; under no circumstances
with an older person, or another child.
The mattress should be firm, but soft.
What a child should eat, and how,
floor, on a sheet; for a half hour. This
will save weak spines and make tine hgÂ»
ures.
It is a matter of great importance, al
though seldom attended to by parents,
to select proper chairs for children when,
they first begin to use chairs. The seat
should be firm and regular, for if soft and
low in the middle the child's neck will
be certain to sink within its shoulders,
and its figure to turn and become dis
torted from the want of a uniform and
. solid support.
Do not allow the children to sit with*-'
out support to their backs: encourage
them to rest the spine by lying back
in a chair; and once a day. after they
have been exercising, make your chil
dren, both boys and girls, lie flat on the
Movements for developing the Â«_-hest
should be simple at first. Reaching the
arms forward with palms touching, while
the breath is slowly inhaled through the
nostrils, gradually opening the arms, and
turning the palms upward;- until the arms
are carried as far back as possible, is a
pood movement. Another exercise ioi
chest development is to reach upward as
far as possible, draw down imaginary
ropes to the sides, and then carry them
back and upward.
Let all bending forward be done from
Â¦.Vie hips-joint, not from the wnist. The
ackbone need not be bent in stooping to
pick up anything.
"The upper point of the forehead and
the most prominent part of the chest,
the child should be taught to hold uplift
ed, as if trying to push up through the
celling" is the advice of one who speaks
with authority. A college professor tells
his boys that If they want to form the
habit of holding their heads up it is good
practice to try to look over the top of the
carriages in the streets while walking;
the arms should hang at the sides.
Much awkwardness would be overcome if
children were taught to let thejr bands
fall easily as 4f hung by ropes, and not
strained into straight positions â "What
shall I do with my hands?" asks a child.
"Let them hang at the end of your
arms," should be the reply. '
Children get little good from what they
learn mechanically. Instead of wasting
too much time, therefore, over wands and
dumb-bells, arouse the youngsters' Interest
by telling them that if they acquire the
proper carriage and deportment of the
body, they will be strong and agile, and
by holding the body erect and straight,
will find It easy to breathe In the right
way, and then have more endurance
when playing tennis, basketball, foot
ball or when running. Clothed in loose
bloomer garments, the child shou'.J be
taught how to torn the hip^ inward and
back; how to draw in the abdomen, lift
the chest to Its proper place, put the
chin back, and poise himself on the balls
jpf the feet and not upon the heels, so
that a line dropped from the chest
strikes the toes. To use the heels, in
stead of the balls of the feet, is not
only tiresome, but the internal organs
are thrown out of position thereby.

If they are to be beautiful they must
be healthy, happy and contented. This,
indeed, will g;o far toward making
them lovely. Children of even weakly
parentsâ not actually diseasedâ who are
brought up with a due regard to the
principles that govern health and growth,
have a better future before them than
those of robust parentage who are not
so reared. Their, whole future depends
upon their physical development, and in
nothing is it of more importance to take
time by the forelock than in the matter
of training children's bodies. This care,
in childhood, never loses its ultimate re
ward, and saves much future trouble.

For the short neck there is nothing

-."There is an exercise -for rounding the
| chest which is much practiced by thin
belles of society. This is the very simple
! one of lifting the hands, palms outward,
j until the fingers touch at the tips. The
.hands should meet Just over the head
and the fingers lightly kiss each other.
Â¦Â¦The elbows should be held out very
sharply so as to give the arms full play
and open the lungs. '
5 The lovely Princess of Pless, who la
said to be the handsomest woman in
'England, was advised to try this exer
cise for a flat chest. She was told to'
Â»iift her arms, with elbows protruding,
as many times as possible without be
| coming fatigued, and to touch the finger
tips over her head as she lifted her arms.
iff One should in mild weather practice
this in front of the window, so as to be
- sure -of good clear air. If dust-laden*
air were drawn into the lungs during
'this exercise the results might be very
distressing, if not positively injurious.
That is the difficulty with practicing
-in the stifling . atmosphere of a closed
, room. One does not benefit as one
should from the exercise, for the lungs
draw in impurities instead of taking

and a light .loose drapery thrown around

well into the scalp. A thorough washing
or shampooing is necessary twice a
month; when rinsing the hair after the
shampoo, put some alcohol or cologne in
the water. This will prevent the child
frctn catching cold. Too much stress
cannot be laid on the necessity at thor
oughly rubbing the hair with heated
towels after washing. Only soft water
should be used for nursery purposes, Tha
ends of the hair should be clipped onca
a month. Curling tonga are extremely
bad for children's hair; if locks abso
lutely must be curled â In "Uttla sugar

cloths. The closely cropped head, turn

Shocks to the nervous system and
febrile disorders often cause squinting In
children. The old idea that the squinting
child needs a little skillful surgery and
nothing more is dying out. Glasses ara
often necessary, but that the child may
be taught to use the squinting eye Is a
new idea to many and the theory of a
learned London doctor. "Of course there
are parents and there are children," ho
says, "on whom all time and trouble
spent in- this way are entirely thrown
away, but on the whole I have been sur
prised at the care and patience with
which directions have been carried out,
and pleased with the results." Squinting
has often been brought on, the same doc
tor says, by a fall or a fright or often
by an illness, such as measles or whoop
ing cough.
The scientific treatment of physical da
fects has reached in these days a high
point of skill; many of nature's unkind
nesses may be overcome to a curious and
interesting extent. Marvelous things aro
done, by the dentist, who is a clever sur
geon in the way of straightening crooked
teeth and bringing into fair* and lovely
proportions the projecting Jaw that so
often mars a child's beauty and makes ita
after years uncomfortable. These are
now so easily achieved that there is no
reason for parents to allow a child to
grow up disfigured. When the second
teeth come, if they show a tendency to
project or lap. they should be pressed Into
their proper position, it ia very easy to
train teeth by regular pressure at certain
fixed times every day. The Instant thera
Is the least sign of decay or a dark spot
appears upon the tooth the child should
be taken to the dentist. . It is of Interest
'to the child's and the woman's or man's
pood looks, comfort and health that their
lirst teeth be preserved as long as possi
ble. One of the most Important functions
is to keep a place in the Jaw for the sec
ond set, and if the first fall out too soon
the second may come too soon and out of
their regular place; then the latter teeth
will not haVe room enough and will bÂ»
twisted sideways or pushed in front of
or behind the others in the jaw. As soon
as a chna cuts Its first teeth the cleansing 1
process should begin by rubbing them
with a bit of linen, and as soon as it is
old enough to allow a brush in the mouth
it should be used at least twice a day. A.
very narrow brush should be the first one.
Children are apt to acquire a decided
liking for the cleansing taste of a few
drops of listerine used in the water with
which teeth are brushed and tha mouth
rinsed.
should be a parent's chief study. The
kitchen 'In which the meals are prepared
must be presided over with as much in
dulgence as if it were a chemical labo
ratory. And it is. The experiments con
ducted in it are of the utmost importance
: and on their results depend the bright
ness of the child's eyes, the clearness,
softness, satin smoothness of the skin. A
child's .cook' can do much to make the
child's flesh, flabby and coarse, sickly,
blotchy and Irritable. The cook can also
do much to make it ..elastic, pink-tinted
and dimpled. Milk and cereals. Â¦ fruit,
beefsteak, nutritious broths and soups,
coarse bread made from whole wheat
I flour, and j simple sweets and puddings.
The child must eat at regular hours.
. Never coax a child to eat. Lack of in
clination often indicates lack of neces
sity. A drink of cold water ; the first
thing, in the morning and the last thing
at night rinses away the impurities that
have gathered all night or all day.
Â¦ A bath is, of course, part of the dally
routine- A warm "tub" In the morning,
and a quick, sponge bath at night; the
drying should be done carefully with a
soft towel. A child's delicate skin can
not stand harsh rubbing.
The nails, besides the daily attention,
should have a ten-minute treatment once
a week. Any detached cuticle must
be carefully trimmed ' away where
necessary, and the flesh about the
nail pressed away from It with a
soft piece of linen. This ought to be
â¢done daily. In this way the delicate flesh
about the finger tips will become firm
and hard, and the child will not suffer
from hang nails. . ,
'.Like everything else, children's locks"
' require careful cultivation. Both night
and morning the hair should be well
brushed, though much combing should be
avoided. In the way of nutrition for the
roots the occasional use of castor 'oil and
alcohol is advised, a small brush being
used, so as to rub the wash into the scalp.
One part castor oil to two parts alcohol
is the proper proportion. Another very
- good thing is sweet lard beaten to a
.'cream, with a few drops of perfume
added. Use this once a month, rubbing

Miss Ruby Cooper, who had led the vot

sented. She says that, although these
things may not have happened through
favoritism, yet it appears to her such is
the case, and that she believes she can
avert unpleasantness by withdrawing
from the contest. Miss Maude Walsh,
while extremely polite, is nevertheless
more pointed in her remarks.
"In entering the contest," she said, "I
was led to believe the street fair man
agement was neutral, which does not ap
pear to be a fact."
Asked to-day for an explanation of this

that they had put in over 200 votes for
her which the recorded returns did not
account for.

I WASHINGTON, May 3.â L. E. Halleck
of Boston, . formerly of the Twenty-sixth
yolunteer Infantry,, testified to-day .before
the Senate Committee on -the Philippines
concerning r the, u's4. v of;;the'. > Vwater..curo"; 1
in the~ Philippine 'archipelago. Halleck
told of the infliction of the. cure upon a
dozen natives at the town of Leon, Pro
vince of Panajr, on> August 21 and, 23; 1900.
They were captured and tortured in order
to obtain information of. the murder of
Privates O'Hearne of Company I, who
had been not only killed, but roasted and
otherwise tortured before death ensued.
Captain Glenn, in charge of a scouting
party, had first obtained a confession of
participation in this crime by one native,
who had implicated twelve others. These
were, the witness said, taken . to Leon,
where his company, under command of
Captain Gregg, was stationed, and there
the "cure" was administered. -
"Who inflicted the cure?"
Â¦ "Members of Company I."
"Were they ordered tc- do so?"
"They wereâ by First Sergeant J. Man
ning, who is now in Boston. (V '
Halleck added that he had witnessed
the torture but had not participated in it.
While the torture was in progress Cap
tain Gregg was at thÂ» company headquar
ters, less than 100 yards distant. ,
"Did Captain Gregg know of the tor
ture?" Senator Rawlins asked, .
"All the command knew it and I don't
see how he could have helped knowing 1 it "
Asked what became of the Philippine
prisoners to whom the "cure" was ad
ministered, he replied that 'they were
placed in a guardhouse 20x25 feet in 'size,
in which there was one window; .arid, in
which there were at times eighteen men
confined. The twelve prisoners were kept
for- four or five months and then , they
tried to escape. That effort had been sue-,
cessf ul on | the part of some, but five or
six fleeing prisoners were shotiand killed
One of them had been killed while try
ing to get away when the' squad was
taken ; to the river for a bath, and the
Natives at Leon.

not been-madei public. .We, have heard
nothing from thei minority, except 'sup

yet every possible effort is being made
by. the department to ascertain the facts

Ihe minority, he insisted, urged- that
Major Gardener be brought here to Wash
ington to repeat his charges before thei
Philippine Committee against his com
rades, who were- 8000 miles away. The
sense of decency of the world, he de
clared, would be shocked by such action.
Major Gardener, he said, had not asked
to come here and give his testimony. Why
he had not asked he dl4 not know. Per
sonally he was ' not given to insinuation,
as the minority seemed to be. If he were
he, .too, might , say some caustic things

Gardeners report. s

table, adding that he preferred to have

Replying to the Republican Senators
Rawlins said that ihis only Intention in
bringing the Gardener matter to the,: at
tention of the Senate had been to develop
the status; of the case. He did not want
to besmirch the army, but he did want
a full inquiry to discover the guilty arid
have them punished, while the innocent
may be exonerated. He said the minority
were "met everywhere with " objections
and obstruction."- Â¦ â¢ ;â¢
-. "I call the Senator from. Utah to order,"
said Lodge. "No Senator has a right to

Riley and quoted .the Secretary of War
as saying. in connection with it that pri-/
vate soldiers were inclined to "draw the

"water cure" was common when they de
sired to obtain information from, natives.
He also said that during hl3 entire'ser
vice, in the. Philippines he had known .of
the killing of probably 200 or 300 natives,
mostly In battle, and of the killing of
probably twenty Americans. \
; Senator Lodge brought out the details
of the murder of Private O"Herne. The
Â¦ witness said, that. in June, 1900, O'Herne,
withHwo other members: of the company,
â¢had been sent to Holla for mall and that
on their return. on June, 30 they were am
bushed by 100 natives, and O'Herne's com
panions were captured. O'Herne had
made a dash to get away, and,. after es
caping from I the attacking party, had
fallen in -with- otner natives supposed to
be friendly, but that instead of proving to
be' so they, had devoted the entire next
day to his torture and death, beginning
at daylight by cutting nim with bolos and
then roasting, him all day toy a slow fire,
not finishing 'until night. All these de
tails, the witness said, had been gathered
from the 'confessions of the men to wnom
.they had given the -"water dure." .
â¢ 'Senator Patterson asked a number of
questions intended' to develop the fact as
to whether the native prisoners had been
informed ' as ; to the character of the in
formation sought, but did not elicit any
thing important from - the witness. He
did, however, succeed in causing Senator
Beveridge to make' protest against his
method of-imiuiry. which brought on a

SMITH'S LATEST ORDER.
SENATOBS IN BITTER DEBATE.
Republican Leaders Defend Adminis-
tration's.Philippine Policy.
WASHINGTON, May 3.â Discussion of
tho Philippine question became heated in
the Senate to-day. Thus far the minority
practically has had a clear field in the de
bate, the policy of the majority being to
p.ermit the criticism by the Democratic
members of the body to proceed without
interruption. ' â¢ ;
To-day it was different. Spooner of
Wisconsin, Lodge of Massachusetts^and
Foraker of Ohio became aroused. They
spoke in defense of the administration, of
the army and of Governor Taft, and they
spoke hotly, almost unrestrainedly. The
result was one 'of the most spirited/de
bates 1 that yet has occurred orj the Philip
pine question. While the debate took a
wide range .it f revolved, around the reso
lution calling for Major Gardener, in the
Philippine Islands, to appear as soon as
possible before the Philippine -Committee
as a 'witness. A cablegram from General,
Chaffee was read by Lodge, saying that
It was impracticable for Gardener to leave
the islands at present.' 'â¢â¢ Â¦Â¦ .
No action had been taken upon the res
olution when the Senate adjourned on ac
count, of the death of Representative
Amos CUmmings of New York.
At the conclusion of â¢ routine business
the resolution previously offered by Pat
terson of Colorado requesting the Presi
dent to cause the Secretary of War to
cable Major Cornelius Gardener, In the
Philippines, to come to Washington to ap
pear as a witness before the Philippine
Committee was laid before the Senate. â¢
Lodge 'Â¦ of Massachusetts, chairman of
the Philippine Coirimittee, explained that
when It had been Â¦ learned that Major
Gardener's regiment would not leave the
Philippines until about June 15 the com
mittee had decided to secure, if possible,
Major Gardener's presence as ' Â¦ soon as
possible. Later It was found that Major
Gardener had filed no specifications of his
charges. The committee then rescinded
its action- calling for Major Gardener.
Yesterday, he said, the War Department
was notified that Major Gardener had
filed a few indefinite specifications, men
tioning the name of only one officer.
When an investigation was ordered Ma
jor Gardener l complained that' the inves
tigation had developed into an attack
upon him and he asked for counsel. A
board was appointed to- investigate Gard
ener's charges, and some,- time probably
would elapse before' 'the Â¦Â¦ board,- could
make its report. Under the circumstances
the Philippine Committee had thought
well to permit Major Gardener an oppor
tunity to place before the Philippine au
thorities the truthfulness of his charges;
Rawlir.s of Utah said it was evident
that Major Gardener thought the investi
gation to be made of his charges was in
unfriendly hands. He . said vthe bias of
General Chaffee, as shown in his cable
gram, indicated that Major Gardener was
unwilling to submit himself to an investi
gation by officers who had been the sub
ject of his criticism. Now, Rawlins said,
it was proposed to go through the farce
of awaiting the specifications filed by'Ma
jor; .Gardener. and: the result, of 'an inquiry
made by the^ board. He sympathized with 1 '
this motives of the Washington officials
that the charges should be fully investi
gated, but he held that some, tribunal
ought to be selected to make the investi
gation without posslbility^of the charge
of partiality. He believed that the com
mittee ought not to refuse to send for
Major Gardener, as his testimony, was ex
tremely important. IS Â¦ â¢' .
Spooner of Wisconsin said the observa
tions of Rawlins were quite characteris
tic of the action of the Democrats in the
course of this debate. He had discovered
nothing indicating bias in General Chaf
fee's telegram.
"The Senator from Utah," continued
Spooner, "seems to be blinded with sus
picion of the army and of almost every
body charged with any responsibility in
the Philippines." .
It seemed to him that there was a too
great willingness on the part of the min
ority to impeach the whole American
army. Rawlins seemed to think no army
board could be constituted which would
investigate, searchingly, the case of
Major Gardener. The charge of Rawlins,
he said, was that as Gardener had made
a general impeachment of military offi
cers in the Philippines, no board could be
constituted which would give him an Im
partial trial. Â¦ -. â¢ â¢ v . , .. -..v..
"The American people, 1 ' he declared,
"will not believe that charge, because
they will know that It is not true of the
army in the Philippines, or any other
American army."
Referring to General Funston, Spooner
said he may have talked too much, but
if he had he had done no more than some
others who are not in military life had
done about this war In the Philippines.
The charge' had been 'made, said he, that
Funaton had "fought his way ; to fame
with the Jaw-bone of an ass.V That was
unjust and unworthy of those who made
it. Funston had won fame as a soldier
by leading the bravest of brave men in
battle and had won at the same time the
commendation of President McKinley, one
of the most beautiful characters in the
life of our nation. Funston 'had not won
his fame with the jaw-bone of, an ass,
but with his sword. In the Senate of the
United States, of all places, - the effort
ought not to be made to smirch the repu
tation and honor of the, army. ' : - '
\ VBut," said he. "the American people
will convict no man without a hearing
Â¦and will convict no' man on statements
made in the Congressional Record."
Spooner declared that he was not willing
to Â¦ vote for .the .resolution because Â¦> the
Secretary of -War,' as soon'as the mat
ter had been brought to his attention,
had ordered an investigation to be made
of the charges of Major Gardener. The
minority complaint seemed to be, he said,
that the Secretary of War had not given
What a different world this would be if
the voice of conscience used a mega
phone!
soard has had no desire to attack Major
3ardener, but is pursuing "k. rigid investi
gation of his allegations irrespective of
what he wishes, and will not permit him
:o shape or dictate the course of the in
vestigation.' â¢ : - ( ;
"I think that any Investigation of Major
jardener lies in the fact that the /board
lesires to test the accuracy of his infor
mation, and the condition Â¦ of - Tabayas
when he was Governor. Some time must
lecessarily elapse before the report is
:ompleted. There are probably many wit
lesses to be examined."
The Secretary of War transmitted this
message to Senator Lodge with a copy
it a cablegram sent by him to-day to Gen
eral Chaffee in response to the latter's
nessage, as follows: -' Â¦
"Cable In full Major Gardener's specifi
cations. Your directions to afford Gard
iner every opportunity are approved. The
t>oard should be specifically enjoined not
to permit the proceedings to assume a
:haracter giving the least color to a claim
that there Is an attack on him, or allow
it to be in any way diverted from a full
ind fair investigation of the truth of his
charges."

iollowing is his reply: . . - Â¦ . .

WASHINGTON, May 3.â A cablegram
has been received at the War Depart
ment from (Serif ral Chaffee, replying to
Secretary Root regarding investigation of
Major "Gardener's charges. . Following te
an extract from the message: . â¢ .â¢â¢Â¦-,Â¦
"With reference to your telegram of
the 1st: Major Cornelius Gardener has
filed a few specifications, very general in
character. In one instance he gives the
name of an officer. The board consists of
Cononel Theodore J. Wint, Lieutenant
Colonel Joseph W. Duncan and Captain
William. T. Johnston, sitting at Lucena
under instructions to afford Major Gard
ener full opportunity to substantiate
every allegation. Major Gardener has
telegraphed Luke Wright. that the inves-r

LOS ANGELES, May^iâ As a result of
the May day strike of the union carpen
ters for a raise in wages to $3 50 per day,
all but five of the building contractors
have acceded to the demand and the men
ordered out have returned to work. But
fifty men remain out', they being em

'The Morbs with whom we -are having
some -trouble are the I>ake Moros. Datto
Bayan is one of the chiefs of this tribe.
The largest number of Moros live in the,
river. country, which is 150 miles from
Lake Lanao, in the Zamboanga district,
which is 2C0 miles away and in the Jolo
Islands, which are probably 300 miles dis T
tant; There is no common bond between
the Lake Moros and the Moros of other
regions. The Spaniards used the: Moros
of Zamboanga to light the Lake Moros,
and there is not a bit of love lost be
tween the Lake' Moros and the River and
Jolo Moros. ' .
I am sure there is no danger at all of
the remaining . Moros Joining with the
lake people because of the fact that they
are all Mohammedans.
Governor Taf t and the officials of the
War Department do not believe that the
revolt will prove as troublesome as some
alarmists anticipate. The Moros are ac
customed to living near the. water, which
enables the troops to reach them. If
necessary it is' proposed to place gun
boats on 'Lake Lanao, and it is predicted
that . this will . promptly bring the rebels
to terms. . . . ; Â¦Â¦
There is no doubt that the Mindanao
rising is considered serious and that it is
causing the President and his Cabinet
considerable concern.

In 1694 the cloth, on which was visible a
representation of the figure of Christ, be
came the property of the House of Savoy
and found its permanent resting place in
a chapel connected with the Cathedral of
St. John the Baptist at Turin. Here it
has remained, hidden from the public eye
in the Interior of a metallic coffer, whose
locks cannot be opened save by royal au
thorization-arid episcopal permission.
Tradition affirms tha\ Mary Magdalene
and her friends piously preserved these
clothes and that they were in safe keep
ing when Jerusalem was captured by
Titus. Then they were carefully secreted
by the Christians.
The body so enwrapped they placed in a
sepulcher, in the garden on Calvary. St.
John, in his twentieth chapter, goes on to
tell us how, when Mary Magdalene and
the disciples, whom she had hastily sum
moned, discovered that Christ's body had
been stolen, as they supposed, from the
sepulcher, they noted that .the linen
clothes lay within the tomb, the napkin
that was about his head not lying with
the linen clothes, but wrapped together in
a place by itself. -
Then they took the body of Jesus and wound
it In linen clothes, with the spices, as the
manner of the Jews is to bury. â xix:40.
It is believed that the holy shroud Is
identical with the grave clothes men
tioned by St. John in his story of the cru
cifixion and burial:
In his opinion a human body, in its ex
halations in the throes of death and sub
sequent to decomposition, may liberate
gases whigh act upon a cloth prepared as
the Hebrews prepared winding sheets in'
exactly the same way as the photographic
processes known to all of us act upon a
sensitized plate.. â¢
His arguments are supported by Pro
fessors de Lage and Colson of Paris, and
have even been accepted by so conserva
tive a medical authority as the London
Lancet.
NEW YORK, May 3.â The world was

serious scientific treatise by Paul Vignon
on the famous shroud of Christ, now pre
served at Turin, and the Herald is, by
courtesy of the author, permitted to re
produce a synopsis of the book. He ex
pressed his opinion that the shroud in
question was the real winding sheet
wherein the Savior's body had rested dur
ing the period between the descent from
the cross and the resurrection. He in
sisted that what has been considered by
some as a fraud, by others as a miracleâ
the outline of a human figure on the cloth
âis merely an extraordinary accident,
fully explicable by science; Â¦

Meanwhile the subject of the gossip is
in Paris, where .the other day she created
a Vfuror by unexpectedly conducting a
band of .music in a well-known cafe, to
the huge delight of the audience.
"She does not propose," continues the
article, "to retire from the stage, but will
probably forsake the music halls for a
West End theater under her immediate
control."

can actress, will be married in England

Lionel Prescott, a lieutenant In the Sec
ond Life Guards, who was born in 1S75
and owns an estate of 4000 acres, has been
revived by To-day.
I would like to Bee the prices' reduced in
stead of raised, the idea being that the latter
course will tend to popularize the theater. Per
sonally, I am contented with a modest com
petency, but I do want people to attend the
theater in Â«ven larger number than now. Look
at America. The whole ground floor of the
theater is given up to stalls at a uniform price
of $1 50, thoueh in America theater-going is
as much a duty as golf and football is with us.
LONDON, May 3.â English theater
goers are mightily worked up over George
Edwardes' suggestion to raise the price
of admittance to the stalls in London
playhouses from 10s 3d to 12s 6d. He holds
that the increased amounts paid to musi
cal comedy stars and the cost of produc
ing up-to-date pieces of that nature are
quite disproportionate to the receipts. To
remedy this Edwardes .advocates an
agreement between the London managers
increasing the price of the best seats by
two shillings. Beerrifehm Tree disagrees
witfl Edwardes and in so doing sounds a
thoroughly American note. He says:
The Morgans had questioned , the cor
rectness of the figures upon which Yerkes
based the Â¦ returns of his system, but
Yerkes blandly waved aside such details,
saying that he had not his notes. He
would, however, be delighted to solve the
sums in arithmetic submitted to him by
opposing counsel if they would allow him
to bring notes referring to such abstruse
matters from his office. Finally the Chi
cagoan was dismissed/somewhat disgust
edly, with the remark: "As you don't
want to be sent back to school, I will not
ask you any more questions," and Yerkes
went out, smiling grimly.
With a smile, Yerkes admitted that he
was largely interested in the financial
and operating departments- of the A new
road, and without a trace of apparent
malice he added: "I do not care to teach
kindergarten schools here."
LONDON, May 3.â There have been
some interesting developments in the bat
tle between the American millionaires for
the control of London's rapid transit sys
tem. I One feature that stands out more
than any other is Charles T. Y.erkes' abil
ity to beat English lawyers at their own
game. Counsel for the Morgans' projected
"tube" line had Yerkes oh the stand be
fore the House of Lords committee for an
hour or so one day this- week. Yerkes sat
passive, ingeniously answering or dodging
questions relating to the financial plans
of his own syndicate. Finally he calmly
remarked to counsel: "I have been listen
ing to your explanations of this matter,"
at which counsel hurried to correct the
witness by declaring that he had only
been asking questions. But Yerkes, im
perturbably and hugely amused at the
committee, continued: "And it seems to
mo that you have certain Information
which I myself at this moment do not
possess." . â¢

VICTORIA, B. C, May 3.â The schooner
Umbrina, which arrived to-day, brought
news of an attempt to kill Captain Mc-
Phee'and burn the schooner Ocean Belle
by a Chinese cook.
The cook planned the deed and catching
the crew on deck and Captain McPhee in
his room he seized a large carving-knife
and held the captain â¢ in . his room by
threatening him with the knife, while he
set a train of powder on a bench leading
to a powder keg, the top of which had
been knocked oft. Then he spread kero
sene about the schooner's cabin in a most
liberal manner. The fuse of. powder led
directly into the powder keg, and the Chi
nese planned to blow up the vessel.
Captain McPhee, seeing his danger, took
chances of being stabbed and ran at the
Chinese, who, instead of attacking him,
hurriedly put a match to the kerosene
and then ran on deck and jumped from
the schooner's rail. He was drowned be
fore the eyes of the crew. .
The captain called the men hurriedly to
the cabin and after a smart fight they ex
tinguished the fire. ,

Chicago Bankers Finan-
cing Rival of Beef
Barons.
Epecial Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, May 3.â The retail butchers
of the United States are banding as
stockholders in a $10,000,000 packing com
pany to enter into competition with the
beef trust as a result of the war against
the packers. The new company is backed
by Chicago banks, and its projectors are
confident from the progress made that it
will be ready for business in a short time.
Many of the largest retailers throughout
the country approve the plan and have
pledged themselves to subscribe for capi
tal stock. They welcome the project as
an opportunity to escape from the ar
bitrary business regulations forced on
them by the beef trust and for the reason
that it will enable them to buy meat at
prices which will follow the market
prices of livestock. The butchers of the
country have in the past feared the
blacklist and have chafed under the rules
o* the trust, but still have been forced
by prevailing conditions to buy from the
combine.
Butchers are solicited as stockholders,
so as to assure the company a large trade
from the start. Only small subscriptions
have been asked, with the intention of In
teresting as many as possible. The pro
posed packing houses will be located at
the Union Stock Tards and will equal in
capacity any plant now existing. A sita
has already been selected. The plant will
be complete in all departments of the
packing business and will supply all
products and by-products to the butchers.
The CWcago Security and Trust Com
pany is financing the deal. S. P. Ander
son, vice president of the company, has
been laboring quietly for several weeks,
and sending out circulars to thousands of
butchers throughout the United States.
The responses, he says, have been enthu
siastic, thousands of dollars having been
pledged and many of the letters even con
taining checka.

San Francisco Golfers to Be Given -a
i The "proposed tournament between
Class A and Class B of the San Francisco
Golf Club 'did" not take place yesterday,"
as no teams had been made up by Cap
tain S. L,.' Abbot Jr. and Leonard Chen
ery. Several golfers were out for - prac
tice. Among them: J. W. Byrne, Andrew
Carrigan, Dr. J. R. Clark, "W. J. Button,'
Captain D. 'j. Rumbaugh, 1 S. L. Abbot Jr.
and H. M. Hoyt. A suggestion has been
made that sand "green" be established in
some sheltered part of the course, where
the sand would not be' liable to be blown
off by the strong winds. It is considered
the practice gained in playing on this
"green" would stand those golfers in good
stead who may visit Southern California,
Ferries â¢ Will Carry Autos.
President F. A. Hyde of .the Automobile
Club of California has notified the mem
bers that the | general manager . ' of the
Southern Pacific Company has issued an
order permitting ; automobiles to be car
ried-on the passenger boats. between Oak
land pier and , San ;, Francisco after I 8
o'clock in the evening. ' Fires must be ex
tinguished on the automobiles before they
are taken ; on board the ferry-boat, and
;the vehicles, must- be . placed at j the j after
end of the vessel, so that they, can read'ily
bethrown overboard in; case of accident.
Automobiles will be carried on -the Oak'
iand Creek ferry-boats during, the day as
usual.. The new regulation will be a great
convenience to those owners who may ar
rive in . Oakland with * their . vehicles late
at night, and may not wish to leave them
there till next. day. -. Â¦< Â¦

PROFESSOR FAIRCLOUGH
GIVES VIEWS
ABOUT "ANTIGONE."
BY BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
REAL DISTINCTION FINDS
RECOGNITION
At THE ORPHEUM
THE Orpheum to-day presents an
attraction that is unique in Or
pheum annals. Miss Julia Hein
rich, the gifted young contralto
who made so pronounced a suc
cess on her recent visit here. Certainly
Manager Morrisey spares no expense in
catering to his public, and Miss Hein
rlch's engagement, I happen to know,
will cost him a pretty penny. Doubtless,
however, the talented girl will be a tre
mendous success, for the history of
vaudeville shows few instances of
"turns" of the like distinguished kind.
It has been predicted that Miss Hein
rich's work would be "too good" for Or
pheum audiences. I disagree. I find
nothing "too good" for the Orpheum
crowd. The pretentious, the mock ar
tistic, the pinchbeck classic will possibly
fail there more quickly than with any
other audience, but where real distinc
tion is involved, as with Camilla Urso,
Remenyi and other lights of the Or
pheum list, I find there just as hearty
and immediate recognition as with any
other house. Without doubt there Is a
small contingent that would prefer Miss
Heinrich to fill in the Intervals between
her songs with a cakewalk, and com
monly one goes to the Orpheum for just
that kind of thing, but If her stunniiig
singing and charming personality do not
make the cakewalk contingent forget its
cakewalk you may call me a bad
prophet.
Naturally, It -would not be wise to try
BtrauBs, say, on a variety programme,
though for the matter of that I have
heard the Gounod-Bach prelude for vio
lin and piano encored at the Orpheum.
But Miss Heinrich will not sing "The
Holy City," neither "Because I Love
Tou So," but will give the following
good and beautiful songs that have been
scored for the Orpheum orchestra by
Oscar Well: "Irish Folk Song," by Ar
thur Foote; â¢'April" and "Mighty Lak a
Rose," by Ethelbert Kevin, and
''Daphne, Love," by Ronald.
The student recital of the California
Conservatory of Music of last Tuesday
evening was a distinctly successful affair.
Sherman & Clay Hall was crowded with
an audience that was not forced to affect
interest, the programme being quite suf
ficient to arouse a genuine attention and
pleasure even If one were not a proud
parent with an embryo Mozart in the cast.
DIstincUy the most promising work from
a temperamental standpoint, with also a
solid technical basis, wasf the piano work
of Miss Amy Petersen, a clever fifteen
year-old girl, who gave two Chopin etudes
and a staccato, study of Scharwenka with
a surprising maturity of grasp. Miss
Petersen also plays the violin, whicn,
however.' there seems no particular reason
for her to do. Miss Lily Hansen. who is
event was a little doubtful of our adven
ture. 'As one of your congregationâ for I
can call it nothing else'â he said, "I must
thank you for one of the most remark
able' â âand so on."
"D6 you think such productions as
the 'Antigone' have any appreciable in
fluence on the native drama?"
"Some they must have, but the Inspira
tion to write the large /thing is mostly
lacking. Vlt must be remembered that the
flowering season of the Greek drama was
during the outburst of patriotism follow
ing Marathon, Thermopylae, fruit of tha
magnificent Insolence that would havÂ»Â»
sacked Sardis, very, citadel of the tyrant
Darius. Every Athenian was a patriot in
a living sense that at any rate made for
a living- art. The stage was also the pul
pit. There the Athenian came to know
his gods and there was pictured the high
est thing known or dreamed by tha
Greek. How high that is these deathless
dramas attest, and I believe it is only by
a return to the simple grandeur of thu
Hellenic tragedy, with Its large, pure
lines and noble unity, that the drama will
again be lifted from the slough into which
it has fallen. But the patriotic inspira
tion is lacking."
"No Persian wars?"
"No Persian wars."*
*'Why is not divinity as it is known to
us a sufficient Inspiration?"
"But 'is It not perhaps*" said the pro
fessor. ."The Oberamroergau 'Passion
Play." for example."
"We may not have Passion plays here."
I remembered. "New "5fork refuses 'Naz
areth,' and the fate of the "Passion Play'
In America is a matter of Philistine his
tory. Still, there ia 'King Herod,' one of
Phillips' latest works: Mrs. Flske will
produce soon 'Mary of Magdala," a drama
with scriptural colojr by Paul Heyse, and
there was^even 'A Voice From the Wil
derness,' a scriptural straw from the
Central Theater. Who knows?'*
. "These things may be the beginning,"
said the professor;- "but Wagner has
most nearly approached the Greek ideal
In modern days, in both material and
treatment. There is the same harmony
of the arts, and moreover a wholesome
absence of the pathological muck-rake of
Ibsen and the psychical spindrift of Mae
terlinck. One gets, indeed, a glimpse of
the golden sunshine of the morning of the
gods. Wagner's people are types, as were
the Greek characters, as were Shakes
peare's, and with them he produces
something of the same lofty effect."

Hidalgo Club Celebrates.
In commemoration of the battle fought
by General Zaragosa In front of the walls
of Puebla, Mexico, on May 6, .1862, the
Hidalgo Club held a patriotic entertain
ment last night at Washington Square
Hall. The main hall was tastefully dec
orated in the' Mexican colors, and flags
of the sister republics were placed
throughout in. juxtaposition. The princi
pal address was delivered by Manuel
Telles Sil, and an excellent programme of
musical numbers and fancy dances was
rendered. The; exercises' were followed
by dancing. A very large crowd was in
attendance. .-
W_HEN a large body of men enter upon the discussion of a particular problem with such
zeal that the discussion 'widens and advances from special instances to general princi
ples there is no telling where the influences of the newly awakened thought will reach
nor what its effects will be. An illustration of that truth is furnished at tills time in the
East, where the discussion of the enforcement of the Sunday laws in New York City has passed
froni politics to the broader question of morals and has brought forth something like a new light
from th'e most conservative of evangelical churches.
Bishop Potter of New York gave encouragement to the liberals in the fight against old
Puritanism by > declaring his opposition to certain Sunday laws in -force in that city, and now Dr.
Rainsford of St. George's Protestant Episcopal Church has spoken out more plainly still. In a re
cent address he is reported to have said: '"In relation to large social questions the churches are
still in retreat. Who was it opposed the opening of the museums on Sunday? Who opposed the
opening of the libraries on Sunday? Who tried to prevent the running of cars on Sunday to give
people a whiff of fresh air? Who. opposes the games of girls and boys on Sunday? The churches.
A couple of boys get into a vacant lot on a Sunday afternoon, but the cops soon find them out,
and the boys have to hide their ball and bat or run off. Whether right or wrong, the beys think the
churches are responsible. Is it reasonable to expect that boys will grow up with a love of Sundav
school when the churches say to them, 'You shall not do this and you shall not do that; you shall
not do anything on Sunday but go to church'? ;#f||f*3 * We are trying 'to do Christ's work
with the,sword, instead of/the cross: This hashed tbthe passage of unfairly discriminating laws
and laws in advance of public intelligence."* r
Dr. Rainsford has further declared that: he is no new comer'to the advocacy *of liberalism, as
he has held and taught such doctrines for more than twelve years. He adds that, he "is' now sup
ported not only by Bishop Potter but by Bishop Doane of Albany.
It is not in New York alone, nor only, among Episcopalians, that liberalism is growing amf
spreading. It is stated that at a meeting in Chicago at which sixty-five prelates, clergymen and
laymen of the Methodist Episcopal church were present it was agreed ."if the clergy 'of the church
expect to keep their young men and women in the fold they must do away withhold restrictions
against card-playing, dancing and attendance. at theaters. If they are : not allowed to follow the
dictates of their conscience, they will attend churches where they will be allowed to do so, or thev
will not attend church at all." A , ': - / , '
Such expressions coming from- some of the most earnest and most eminent leaders of the
churches show how rapidly the people of the East are ridding themselves of the.old Puritan ideas
of morality and of the doctrine that restrictions must be placed upon every kind of enjoyment.
No harm is going to come to the people of the East from the new. movement. There will
be no confusion of morality with immorality by reason of the enlarged liberty of individual con
science. -Drunkenness will still be condemned notwithstanding a man may be permitted to have
a glass of wine on Sunday. Card-playing for amusement will not carry with it a license for gambling
nor will dancing mean anything, vicious' or depraved. In" the old days when the stage was well
nigh universally condemned by'the. better class ."of .people, it had of necessity to appeal to the
worse elements and naturally it became licentious; but when a broader liberalism prevailed the*
stage improved.
A similar result has been, obtained in .eveiy broad experiment in the domain of." morals
Nothing is gained by a church or by- society in imposing upon men and \womeh restrictions which
their own consciences do not approve. It ,may be said of every issue of this kind that restrictions
do more harm than good, and Qr.Rainsford.put the mattef clearly with respect to the local option
law in New York^City by saying even if it were carried by' 50,000 : majority in Manhattan as
long as 200,000 poor men wanted : drink and the 'clubs are lopen you would do irreparable injury to
pass a prohibitory measure and ; make men lawbreakers as well. A ~ " '

THE following joyful item concern
ing recent Callfornlan history ap
pears In the current number of
Harper's Weekly. As an exartvple
of the art of putting two and pno
together and making seventeen it
is irresistible, its syllogistic brilliance
putting to. shame the proudest effort of
the gifted illogicians of the Mllpitas
Press, not- to mention the Arizona Kicker.
To add the last touch to its delicious in
consequence, the article is adorned with
a portrait of President Wheeler. But
here it is, and how it came to pass the
eye of / the Harper editor is more than I
can understand:
â¢ Of the famous pioneers who have gone Into
California from the East, Benjamin Ide Wheel
er is the latest. He is the pathfinder for the
Pacific slope In the language and literature of
Greece, the first great Greek scholar to take
up a residence Id sight of the Sierras and in
spire the youth who flock to the two universi
ties by the Golden Gate to a generous emula
tion In the learning; of the dead language which
is lmmort&l. Sharing: with Gilderaleeve a
reputation for Greek scholarship on the Atlantic
coast, Professor Wheeler made the Greek school
of Cornell known to the scholars' of the world.
Barely three years have elapsed since he oc
cupied the presidency of the University of
California, and already the youth of the Ameri
can State in which the glorious configuration
of mountain and sea, climate and products,
approaches nearest to Greece, are appearing In
Greek plays, with a i lyrical accompaniment of
Mendelssohn's music. "The Antigone" of Sopho*
cles has just been presented by a cast made up
entirely of the faculty and students of Stan
ford University, a sister Institution to that over
which Benjamin Ide "Wheeler presides.
Naturally the article has created no end
of amusement at both universities, and as
"The Antigone" will be given on Satur
day evening next at Berkeley, the con
temporary Gibbons will have another shot
coming. His version of the affair la
awaited with interest.
The Harper's chronicler was right In
just one pointâ that the production of a
Greek play as it has been given by the
faculty and students of "the sister Insti
tution to that over which Benjamin Ide
Wheeler, presides." is a matter of national
artistic importance. Had such a produc
tion been given by Harvard not only the
metropolitan press but that of the whole
United States would have noted it. It Is
the first Greek play to be done in Cali
fornia and one of a â¢ rare few- to be. given
in all ' America. â¢ Not only, that, buf by
impartial authorities who have, seen the
Harvard, Vassar and the few other Amer
ican presentments of Greek tragedy it Is"
conceded that the Stanford edition com
pares most favorably with these. Yet
further, the whole material of the per
formance was found within Stanford's
walls, with the single exception of thd
stage ma'nager, Leo Cooper. The costumes
Were made by Mrs. H. R. Fairclough, the
scenes painted by university hands, the
orchestra, numbering thirty-three mem
bers, was all Stanford talent under the
university director, A. L. Scott Brook,
with of course the players and chorus â
altogether counting seventy-one personsâ
from the faculty and student membership
of the Greek department. Two perform
ances of the play have been given with
much eclat at the university Itself and
single performances at Los Angeles,
Santa. Barbara and Pasadena to crowded
hbusls. The presentment at the- Univer
sity ef California next Saturday evening
will fittingly close the worthy career of
tne Stanford "Antigone." No one inter
ested in the art of the drama can afTord
to miss it. This- auditor also might use
fully take in, say," "Fiddle Dee Dee" the
following evening as a specimen of what
the centuries since Sophocles sang his no
ble song have done for the dramatic art.
Wondering if the modern Athenians
down at Stanford . had any fell design
upon the contemporary drama. I went to
see Professor H. R. Fairclough, the Ivy
crowned and white-bearded Coryphaeus
who lends so much dignity to the stately
chorus of the "Antigone." Posaibly Pro
fessor Fairclough has had most to do
with the production of the play, though
ncbly assisted | by :; Professors Murray
Rolfe and many, other distinguished Gre
cians.
The professor -acknowledges a wide dis
respect for the present day drama Its ig
noble vkey, facile smartness and patho
logical trend. , -
-Yes. our ideaJn giving the 'Antigone*
was educational in the fullest sense of tha
word," .he exclaimed. ."I remember the
profound , impression the Harvard 'Oedi
pus' and other Greek plays I have seen
made upon their audiences, and felt that
nothing we could do here for the univer
slty- lor; the students, for the drama,
could be more widely useful.- -
"Then I had found an Antigone in Miss
Cookseyâ you know, an Antigone Is as es
sential . to 'Antigone' as a Hamlet to
â¢Hamlet ; and, again, we . had the finan
cial help from generous friends Interested
in the enterprise, that finally made possi
ble-the long-dreamed-of production. T i
short, the psychological moment had ar
rived. -

course. Still, with our material, all ama

well. We feel richly.' repaid . for our ef

GIFTED TODNG CONTRALTO WHO
Â¦WILL, BEGIN ENGAGEMENT AT
ORPHEUM THIS AFTERNOON.
"^ T J HEN Father D. O. Crowley first announced to the public his. project of establishing
\ /W a farm school for boys it was received throughout the State with general and cordial
\/ \/ approval. Commendation was promptjfor commendation costs nothing. Now Father
v . * Crowley has carried his work forward to the point of attainment. He has found a
farm of upward of a thousand acres well 'fitted for the school, and he appeals, to the public for
$80,000 to pay for the land, make necessary improvements and equip the school for work. Com
mendation now must take the shape of contributions. Let us hope they will be as prompt and as
liberal as were the approving words.-"- ; -
; There can be no doubt of the excellence of the project nor of the efficiency of the man who
has undertaken it. â¢Farm training is one of the needs of the State, and Father Crowley is exactly
the man to take charge of the boys who are to receive the training. He needs no indorsement in
this city^ His personality and his work are well known.. Had he not' been himself the promoter of
the plan, he would still be recognized as the r^ght man to found it and start.it on its career. The
record of his work in the Youths* is ample testimonial to his fidelity and to his ability,
and assures for his . undertaking an attentive consideration from all who have any interest whatever
in the cause of education. ' â¢
Â¦ . In recommending the enterprise in a circular letter Archbishop Riordan. says: "An oppor
tunity to secure such a farm may not come again, and it is^ hoped that an ever-generous public
will give freely the money required. The broad policy which has made the Youths' Directory a
home for abandoned boys of every race, color and creed will guide the managers of the farming
school, and for that reason this appeal is addressed not only, to Catholics, but to men and. women
of every creed. The work to be done by the new school will redound not only to the glory of God,
but also to the improvement of citizenship and the benefit of the. State." â¢ .. >
The movement to carry boys back to the land and give them a training whiclyvill fit them
for scientific farming is in line with the trend of thought, of the most earnest men and women of
our time. The material tendencies of the age carry young men from the farms to the cities. The last
census showed how -powerfully those tendencies are operating in the United States. In 1880 there
were 580 cities or towns with a population of more than 4600, containing an aggregate popula
tion of about 12,000,000, or one-fourth of the population of the Union. In 1900 the towns and
cities in excess of 4000 inhabitants contained upward of 38,000,000 of people, or one-half of the
whole population of the country.
Those figures, however, do not show the whole truth. The main trend of population, has
been not to the small towns, but to the largest cities. Boston, New York, Chicago and San Fran
cisco have grown out of proportion to the country that surrounds them. The results of this drift
on the part of the' young have been in many respects deplorable. The avenues of city employment
have been congested, the host of the unemployed has been augmented by thousands of sturdy
young men who could-have been profitably employed on the farms, and the slums have received
into their deadfalls many a youth who in a rural community would have' lived a useful and
wholesome life. v . . â¢
â¢ This crowding, to the cities is by no means the result of the operation of an economic law,
as has been sometimes asserted. As a matter of fact there . are thousands of men in the cities
who could have been more successful even from a strictly monetary point of view had they devoted
to farming the same amount of energy and sagacity they employed in their business in the city.
California to an especial degree offers opportunities for trained experts in rural industry. There is
not a county in the State that does not need a larger number of men skilled in the work
of orchards and vineyards than are at present to be obtained.
To meet and counteract the* rush to the cities there is needed an education an^ a training
that will turn the thoughts of boys to the advantages of rural life. "Back to the land" is therefore
a cry that appeals to, the business and the bosoms of men. Moral interests and monetary interests
alike are to be served by it. It affects patriotism as well as philanthropy, for a State is dependent
for its welfare and its manhood upon its farming population. . ,
California needs the projected school. ,, This ]is the right time to found it. The right man is
at the head of it. The appeal has gone forth tb'the 'public. Let : the response be -prompt.' ':

the increase is not to be made till the first

DEVELOPING THE MINES
The right man backed by the right kind of
an exhibit would turn many to the mining coun
ties, and from the investigations and invest
ments resulting . therefrom new developments
would be made, new people given employment,
and additional revenue added to the world. The
whole question simplified 13 one of advertising
more thoroughly our resources and opportuni
ties, and the mining counties, old as they are
and rich as they are. are not' understood and
appreciated: abroad as much as their wealth
warrant!", and hence need to advertise as much
as any of the others.
If the miners want to get In this movement
all they have to do is to provide "an exhibit of
at least one or twQ average samples of all the
commercial minerals of the State and place
with- them some man who knows all- about
those minerals, who knows what localities they
arc found in and the extent of each as shown
by present developments. If he finds a man In
terested in copper he wants to tell him where
copper deposits In California are knoflrn to ex
ist; If in quartz, to direct him to the princi
pal quartz districts; If in gravel, to the most
important gravel mines of the State; if in iron,
to the iron deposits: if .in marble, to the lo
calities where marble is known to be plenti
ful, and so on through the entire category of
all the many economic minerals which are
known to abound within the State of Califor
nia. ' -
Strikes are frequently, occurring in' Califor
nia which if made in some remote district, dif
ficult of access and heretofore unknown as a
mining region, would cause a stampede of pros
pectors at once, but which on account of their
usual- occurrence here attracts little attention.
I have been asked by representatives of the
mining Industry of California whether there
is pnv way In which miners or strictly mining
countries can gat Into the larger movement for
State development in a way to realize some
benefits for their Interests. I have told them
that if we can carry out the idea of advertis
ing the State Board of Trade exhibit and in
formation bureau more thoroughly at home, un
ti' they shall Â¦ become so popular and univer
sally known as to attract all . strangers who
may land in this city. In search of homes or
investments in California, there is no reason
why a representative of the mining
could not do a great deal with visitors in ex
plaining to them the opportunities which the
State offers for investments in mining and
other industries peculiar to the mining coun
ties ' "' ' Â¦
â¢ Already, without the local advertising con
templated, there are from 300 to 500 visitors
go through the exhibit of the State Board of
Trade every day, and of this number at least
one-third are strangers. One-half the : stran
gers on an average are here hunting for an op
portunity to get a foothold In California. â . .
Among so many there are sure to be some,
who could be interested In mining, and a rep
resentative of that industry would , find the
opportunity every day. to direct some of these
people to places where they m'ght expend their
capital or their labor, as the case might be.
in mining ventures, with as, much assurance of
success as in almost any other line of indus
try. Â¦
Those who know California's mining re
sources know that they have as yet only been
touched; that many more millions lie Imbedded
in the mountains of California than were ever
taken out, and that the entire mining region
of the State . to-day .Offers Inducements greater
in many respects than. are offered by countries
farther away and harder to reach. \ .
EXHIBITS ARE NEEDED.
The State. Board of Trade has just en
gaged in exploiting mining information on
a new line, having collected In one large
case samples of commercial minerals from
every mineralized county of the State
and this is placed where every one. of
the thousands of ! visitors to the State
board' s exhibition : hall will flee it The
railroad "companies are also actively en
gaged in giving knowledge of California
mines simultaneously with- the imparting,
of facts about climate, and the wealth of
farm lands to whoever will read. All the
signs are that the California mines will
in the near future have the advantage of
new capital and new enterprises will be
created on the lodes. :
Concerning the work that may be done
to make known the mines of California,
Manager- Filcher of the State Board of
Trade makes the following statement:
.Â¦â¢ââ¢'.Â¦", . Â¦ . â¢ Â» -
There is no lack of means in immediate
view for the exploitation of facts relative
to the mining industry of California. In
deed, this State is singularly favored
among the Pacific Coast States at this
time in having so many, agencies at work
to bring its resources,, mineral and agri
cultural, before the world. Attention has
recently been called to an admirable series
of county registers and maps, prepared
under the direction of State Mineralogist
Aubury, for the dissemination of exact
and reliable knowledge concerning mines
and prospects, something having large
practical value. The Promotion Commit
tee" has now several thousand dollars per
nionth of income in view, which will all
be expended in giving the Eastern people
facts that they need to encourage tbem
to come to California to live."
During the afternoon Principals Mann
and Faulkner were busy with Directors
Roncovieri and Mark in the office of the
board scrutinizing records and reports of
principals. Their intention is to procure
such data as will : enable them to put
plainly before the, Board of Supervisors
the needs of the .department and the
actual amount it is entitled to, based on
the average enrollment of pupils during
the last fiscal year.
Resolved, By the teachers in the city and
county of San Francisco in mass meeting: aÂ«
sembled,- first, that the teachers now employed
should not through the' reduction of their sal
aries contribute to the furnishing of such
accommodations or instruction made necessary
by the prosperity of the city, but, second, that
the city should through its Board of Supervis
ors make special provisions for any increase of
attendance during the school year of 1002-1903
over the attendance of the present school year.
Third, that a committee of eighteen, of whom
the chairman of this meeting be a member,
be appointed to confer with the Auditor, thei
Board of Education, the Superintendent of
Schools and the Board of SuDervisors, to the
end that the appropriation for the School De
partment for the fiscal year of 1002^190:1 shall
be amDle to maintain and provide for the in
creased and constantly increasing school at
tendance.
Whereas, The estimate of the Auditor for
the maintenance of the School Department for
the fiscal year of 1002-1003 is In the opinion of
the Board of Education and the Superintendent
of Common Schools inadequate in that it will
not permit the board to make provision/for the
construction of School buildings, the rental of
rooms, the employment of additional teachers
made necessary by the rapid growth of the
city, without the reduction of the salaries of
teachers, therefore be it
The committee of teachers appointed at
Friday's mass meeting met yesterday in
the City. Hall to adopt a plan for the pur
pose of urging \a more liberal appropria
tion for the School Department than that
recommended- by . Auditor Baehr. There
was a long "discussion, in which the senti
ment was general that Bafehr's recom
mendation Is insufficient to conduct the
schools properly. . . / #
A sub-committee was appointed consist
ing of Joseph O'Connor,. principal of the
Mission High School; A. L. Mann, princi
pal of the Denman Grammar School, and
Richard D. Faulkner, principal of the
Franklin School. These. will confer with
the Board of Education to-morrow, wheu
the actual requirements of- the depart
ment will be canvassed. Arrangements
will. then be made for a meeting with the
Auditor and the Supervisors' Finance
Committee to discuss the situation. The
following resolution memorializing the
Board of . Supervisors to grant an in
creased appropriation, which was drafted
at the mass meeting of teachers and sub
mitted to the sub-committee for action,
was thereupon adopted:.
Coast's Mineral Resources Are

SEATTLE, May 3.â Keeping leg-irons
on a 10-year-old boy is a part of the sys
tem of discipline adopted by Major Cicero
Newell, superintendent of the Boys' and
Girls' Aid Society of Seattle. He con
fessed as much to the Board of County
Commissioners yesterday, when he was
called in to explain the charge made
apainst him by E;. A. McDonough.
Major Newell is paid by the county for
keeping homeless children until homes
can be found for them.' i A boy J named
Ernest Brown was placed in his charge
recently. McDonough, wishing to adopt
the boy. went over to Newell' s place and
there found the child dragging himself
around with chains on his ankles.
McDonough reported the matter to the
County Commissioners, and Newell was
called in to explain. He admitted tfiat he
had sometimes put chains on the- boys'
legs^ for a short time,; but denied that he
had compelled him to wear them all day
at any time. He was warned not to re
peat the offense. < Â¦
It is believed that the boy had worn the
chains considerably, as It is said the skin
was rubbed off his ankles. The boy has
been taken away from the home by Mc-
Donough, who will adopt him. . j '-'-.*

REDDING, May 3.â The fiercest fire that
ever raged in Redding occurred this aft
ernoon, when a row of Â¦ frame . business
buildings with a frontage of 150 feet In the
business center of California- street was
swept out. The conflagration cleaned out
everything between two brick business
blocks. The known loss is $20,000, with in
surance. of about $14,000. ,
Thesflre started in the Paragon ; Hotel
and was checked at the brick block on the
north, owned by. W. j H. Bergin, and c by,
the' Free Press block, owned by Frank M.
Swasey, . on. the south.. Both r of these
buildings for a time seemed doomed and
the Free Press block, worth $20,000, was
given up. It escaped with $2000 damage.
The. origin of" the fire is in doubt. Ex-
Assemblyman J. A. Hubbard .says-he
found a burning lamp with- a- curling iron
it it which had fired the wallpaper. Land
lord 'D. G. Coy says no lamps were kept
in his : ' house and that :the-:-; fire -which
started a hundred. feet from the -kitchen
must have been caused by crossed electric

A BOY'S DEATH
Jose.
Terrible Accident Befalls
a Child in San
It is supposed that the child in playing
with the cow tied the rope about his neck
and in trying to drive her was dragged
to death. The wound on the head was
either caused by a kick from the animal
or in - striking the fence while belnir
dragged. The child expired before a phy
sician arrived.
This evening when the other children
came In to supper Peter was missing and
a search revealed him dying in the cow
yard. About his neck was the end cf
the cow's rope and on his head was a
deep cut.
The lad. with h!s parents. Mr. and Mrs.
Cirso de Salvo, who reside In San Fran
cisco, came to San Jose a few days ago
to visit C. Palezzeri and family on Lu
crptia avenue. This afternoon the boy
went out to play with the children. The
Palezzeris have a cow and the little boy
took a great liking to it.
SAN JOSE, May 3.â Peter de Salvo, a
seven-year-old lad, met a tragic death
this evening by being dragged to death
by a cow.

VANCOUVER, B.C., May 3.âDismast
ed half-smashed from a battering by
the rough waves of the northern seas, the
steamer Concordia was picked up yester
day off the coast of Vancouver, Island by
the Vancouver, steamer New, England.
The finding of. the vessel, points defi
nitely to another awful casualty in the
list of coast disasters. Not a living soul
was found aboard. -The boat was fully
equipped, well engined and had apparent
ly been fitted out ready for a long coast
cruise. She would have carried at least
four of a crew and had sleeping apart
ments for half a dozen others, so that
probably at least- eight 'or nine persons
were aboard. Where they are now no
one knows. The New England made a
search of nearby coasts, but found noth
ing.
When found the vessel was being swept
from stem to stern by every wave, and
getting away in a small boat would have
been impossible. What was the fate of
the crew and the passengers is a mys
tery. They were probably swept over
board.
The New England ran across the dere
lict yesterday afternoon. The hull of the
steamer was fifty miles off the northern
end of Vancouver Island and fifty miles
west of Ftizhugh Sound. 'Â¦
She was away out In the open sea twen
ty miles from the regular course of north
bound vessels. She was drifting north
toward the Queen Charlottes, from whose
halibut banks the New England was com
ing. The pilot house and the after house
over the boiler had been carried away by
the monster seas which were still rolling
yesterday. . :
The vessel was rolling heavily and Cap
tain Gott of the New England does not
believe she would have stayed afloat
another two hours. Her hold was more
than half full of water and small casks
and boxes of provisions were , floating
around with a scum of coal dust over the
imprisoned water. There were several
large barrels and chests of hams, bacon,
sugar and other staples and half a dozen
boxes ' of sea biscuits.
. The steamer had evidently fitted out on
Puget Sound, for there were Seattle labels
on some of the boxes, and she had prob
ably coaled at Nanaimo or. Union. There
were two rifles and two shotguns, which
would indicate " that the passengers were
either mine prospectors or. timber hunt
ers who had been searching along- the
coast. There was some clothing scattered
and under pieces of displaced machinery,
but nothing to show the names of the
people who had been aboard. The coal
was still well stowed and there was
enough to last the boat for a. month. The
hull over all was about sixty feet in
length and between twelve and fourteen
feet beam. :
The vessel was apparently new and may
have. been built,. at -some one of tha can
nery: posts along, the coast. The I only
name like hers in the coast shipping reg
isters Is that, of the poncord, a smaller
vessel, whose home, port Is St. .Michael,
Alaska. .
Captain Gott got the derelict in tow of
the New England and after giving, her.
enough speed to make steerage way. bailed
her out and shoveled the coal overboard
to lighten her and finally towed her into
a secret cove at the northern end of Van
couver Island, where she now lies. '
Officers of the New England are con
vinced that the crew met their end some
where off the rocky coast and the worder
is that the derelict stayed afloat so long.
Her provisions and outfit are destroyed,
but as- she stands the vessel, should be
worth several thousand dollars. . .

Here's a statement '* W^.
from a man who suffered with
malaria. If you suffer, too,
read what he says and become
cured.
April 28, 1902.
Gentlemen : â - vv ..-: : -~
I desire to make a statement of my malaria experience and
how I was permanently cured by taking Halpruner's. I am doing
this because I want others to know what a valuable medicine
yours is for the cure of malaria, and hope they will cure them-
selves as I did.
For several years I have been engaged in Working in
Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, and a part of my duty was* 5 to
care for the lawns and flowers, and it was quite necessary for me
to do considerable watering. â¢ r
About two years ago I contracted a stiffness, tired and un-
restful feeling in my joints, my back ached and I became dizzy
upon arising in the morning. This was soon followed by loss of
appetite, biliousness, fever and chills. I became so sick I could
not perform my labor and I had to take to my bed. Doctors ad-
vised me that I had the malaria and gave me prescriptions for
it, but I was unable to get any relief until I tried Halpruner's. I
took a teaspoonful of Halpruner's in a glass of water .four times *
a day and -broke up my chills and fever at once.
"J. continued taking the medicine until I had used a full large
bottle and was then cured permanently.-, p
I have not had a recurrence of the disease, but take a dose
every once in a while when I feel the least bit indisposed. I think
Halpruner'r is a remarkable medicine, and I think I have a right
to think so, because I have had a personal experience with it. I
hope all malaria sufferers will receive the benefit Halpruner s has
given me. .
Yours, truly, / .
A great many people are suffering from malaria all the time especially
during the spring and summer. ' -These people are. taking quinine, calomel and
mother. drugs that can't possibly help them- to healthâ only temporary relief and
a savage return of the' malaria within a few days.
f Halpruner's. is a harmless, easily-taken medicine, that drives the malaria
poison, cuit, of : the body through the pores of the. skinâ it drives malaria out to.
stay and does no harm whatever to any. other part of the body. If vou suffer
from malaria, chills, fever, a tired, dizzy feeling:, bones and joints ache no appe-
tite, sluggish. liver. and coated'toneue.. try * Halpruner'sâ insist on your drutreist

How I Cure
Weak, Puny Men
Give me a man broken down from dissipation, hard work or. worry, ,
from any cause which has sapped his vitality. Let him follow my advice 1
for three months and I will make him as vigorous in every respect as any |
man of his age. . Â¦ 1
I will not promise to make a Hercules of a man who was never in- 1
tended by nature to be strong and sturdy. Even that man I can make bet- J
ter than he is; but the man who has been strong and has lost his strength (
I can make as good as he ever was. 1
I can give back to any man what he has lost by violation of the laws 1
of nature. I can stop all drains upon his vitality, in ten days. , ; |
A man who is nervous, whose brain and b^dy are weak. who_ sleeps ,
badly, awakes more tired than when he went to bed, who is easily dis- (
ccuraged. inclined to brood over imaginary troubles, who has lost ambi- 1
tion and energy to tackle hard problems, lacks the animal electricity J
which the Dr. 'McLauehlin Electric Belt supplies. .;â¢ i,
The whole force of vitality in your body is dependent upon your ani- (
mal electricity. When you lose that by draining the system in any man- 1
ncr my Belt will replace it. and will cure you. 1
Mr Karry U. Jackson. Valleton, Cal., writes March 1: "Although you are a .
Granger to me rcy heart warms toward you as a great benefactor and friend, and I '
am* more than grateful to you. Already I can ferl the vigor of new life In my body; '
r.o aches and no pains. I wish you every success in your work." ' (
Letters like that tell a story which means a great deal to a sufferer. J
Thev are a beacon light to the man who has become discouraged from ' (
useless doctoring. I get such letters every day. â¢â¢ (
My Belt has a wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces i
and invigorates them, and stirs up a great force of energy in a man. <
I make the best electrical body -appliance in the world, having devoted '
twenty years to perfecting it. I know my trade. My cures after every- (
thing else has failed are mv best arguments. j
Mr. John Gately. Lor.g Valley, Cal., writes January 26, 1902: "Tour belt has re- ,
lieved me of rheumatism and stomach trouble to such an extent that I can "now do a
good fiay'6 work in peace. I have gained thirty pounds In weight and am still lm- '
proving."* i
j Give me a man with pains in his back, a dull ache in his muscles or '
joints, "come-and-go" pains in the shoulders, cheshand side. Sciatica in j
his hip. Lumbago. Rheumatism, or any ache or pain, and mv Belt will (
pour the oil of life into his aching body and drive out everv sign of <
pain. No pain can exist where my Belt is worn. <
Â¦ Mr. E. B. Miller of Compton ave.. Los Angeles, Cal., writes on March 7, 1902: *
"I have -used your high grade Belt for two months for lame back, rheumatism and (
weakened nerves, and am now a well man. I have gained over six pounds in weight <
and feel as strong and hearty as I ever did." ,-Â¦"_'
They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or ham- <
let in the country which has not cures by Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt. <
-Now, what does this mean to you, dear reader? If you are not what '
you ought to be. can you ask anv better proof to make you try it? Is '
there a remedy which is as simple, as easy to use. as sure to cure, and as '
cheap as Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt? I have not seen one. You !
must try it. In justice to yourself, and to those who look to you for ,
their future happiness, try it now. Act this minute. Such a matter i
ought not to be delayed. â¢ >>h
It's as good for women as for men. Worn while you sleep, it causes '
no trouble. You feel the gentle, glowing heat from it constantly, but no (
stine. no burninc. as in old-stvle belts. (

LOS ANGELES. May 3.â After
seven sessions to-day the club
women are prepared for a re
. cessâ riot a restâ on Sunday, for
many are going on an excursion
to Mount Lowe, dissenting sisters not
withstanding. There is also to be a gar
den party in honor of visiting press
women, whichi some of tae club women
frown upon, but which promises to be a
large and representative gathering of
writers.
To offset this frivolity, however, several
pulpits will be occupied by delegates,
though less than heretofore has been done
in this direction. At the First Presbyter-
Ian Church Mrs. May Alden. Ward is to
epeak on "Voices of To-day," while at the
First Methodist Church the general theme
of "The Modern Ishmael" will be pre
sented by Mrs. Robert Burdette of Pasa,,
dena, â¢vice president prospective; Mrs.
Cynthia Westover Alden of New York,
president of the International Sunshine
Society, and Mrs. Florence Keiley of New
York, promoter of Consumers' Leagues.
The political situation remains the same
to-^ay. The effort made by Mrs. Mary
Stlison, a leading California club woman,
to oppose Mrs. Burdette in the race for
office, has fallen flat, for the majority
of California club women think that what
ever office comes to this State, in acknowl
edgement of the biennial, should be filled
by Mrs. Burdette.
An amusing side Issue to the recording
secretary race occurred this afternoon,
when Mrs. Robert Hall Wiles of Chicago,
who figured in the late famous anonymous
letter affair, was asked by Mrs. Fox to
take her place for a while this afternoon.
The Chicago people, who are advancing-
Mrs. John Sherman for the place, most
of whom are antagonists to Mrs. Wiles,
are aroused that this distinction should
have been shown her, even though she is
not running for office.

Second â Establishment of a General Fed

papers from States) to promote reciprocity be
tween the States upon all lines of work and
methods.- . . .
We shall hope through this conference to
make some distinct Â¦ recommendations to the
national committee, and as one member said
ln her last letter, one who has made "recip
rocity" her watchward, we have two points to
present In the beginning.
First â Improvement of State committees
through comparison of methods. (Exchange of
speakers, as well as papers being particularly
recommended â also better standards in refer
ence to both.)
Some months ago the board of the General
Federation considered the need of a national
reciprocity committee, from which, as a well
known central bureau, could be obtained papers
and lectures upon all possible subjects, without
going through the maze of correspondence now,
a necessity. Questions are constantly asked
the officers, answers to which . are Impossible
without again referring the correspondents to
the different State committees. These com
mittees are known only through their year
books, and each . deals with the special needs
of its own Btate. . /
Probably the most practical feature of
the four afternoon sessions was the reci
procity bureau idea as brought out by
Mrs. Philip Moore, chairman of the reci
procity session. Mrs. ;Moore was ap
pointed by the national, board to head a
committee which should devise some
means of centralizing the various reci
procity committees, and this conference
was for that purpose. A portion of her
report follows:

Side social affairs are beginning to be

There were a number of interesting ad
dresses and reports at all sessions. Miss
Mabel Clare Craft read a paper on "Ad
vantages of Coeducation," of which this
is an excerpt:
It la wholly to the advantage of the entire
raca and to woman's half of it, that women

which are members of the General Fed

the proposed amendment be thrown out. '
This is the point Mrs. Lee will raise
Monday, printed slips having been dis
tributed among the delegates.
Mrs. Mary Lockwood of Washington,
who was appointed at the last biennial to
secure a new charter from Congress, will
report. It was thought that this conven
tion would be able to act under the new
charter which has been secured, but it
has been ascertained that even if the con
vention approves it will be necessary for
the fifty incorporators, or at least a ma
jority of them^ to travel to Washington
from various parts of the country to hold
a meeting and vote the rest of the body
in. Not until this is done will the new
charter be legally accepted.
The literature session is always a star
affair, and the one which took place this
evening under Mrs. May Alden Ward of
Boston was no exception. The- entertain
ers were Mrs. Jessie Eldrldge Southwick
of Boston, the Shakespearean reader;
Mrs. Mabel Loomls Todd of Amhurst,

Children's taste ls ofttlmes more accur-

fit the body than that of adults. Nature
'works more accurately through the chil-

A Brooklyn lady says: "Our little boy
has long been troubled with weak diges-
tion. We could never persuade . him to
tfike more than one taste of any kind of
cereal food. He was a weak little chap
and we were puzzled to know what to
feed him on. One lucky day we tried
Grape-Nuts. Well, you never saw a child
eat with such a relish, and It did me good
to see him. From that day on It seemed
as though we could almost see him grow.
He would eat Grape-Nuts for breakfast
and supper and I think he would have
liked the food for dinner.
"The difference in his appearance Is
something wonderful.
"My husband has never been known to
fancy cereal foods of any kind, but he
became very fond of Grape-Nuts and has
been much improved in health since us-
teg it.
"A friend has two children who were
formerly affected with the rickets. I was
satisfied that the disease was caused by
lack of proper nourishment. They
showed 1L Sol urged her to use Grape-
Nuts as an experiment and the result
was almost magical. They continued the
food and to-day both children are well
and strong as any children in this city,
and, of course, my friend is a firm be-
liever ln the right kind of food, for she
has the evidence before her eyes every
day.
"When I have some task to perform
about the house and don't feel very
strong, a saucer of Grape-Nuts and cream
stimulates me, and I am able to do the
task at hand with ease. . . 7

WITH the arrival yesterday of
the British ship Corunna, one
more of the overdue fleet has
confirmed the judgment of
those speculators who take
the optimistrc view and risk their money
on the chance of safety. The Corunna
was on the overdue list at 15 per cent, but
reinsurance speculation on her had ceased
before she arrived, as several days ago
a vessel arrived that reported her ail
right and on the way.
The Corunna left Newcastle, Australia,
February 3, with a- large cargo of coal
and ccke. Of coal she .has in her hold
3103 tons, of coke 669 tons. Four' days
after leaving Newcastle she encountered
a heavy westerly gale, accompanied by a
high, confused sea. At the height of the
gale the vessel was thrown on her beam
ends. Her. cargo shifted to port and for
several hours things lookeu pretty bad for
speculators that played her to arrive..
The storm abated, howeVer, cargo was |
trimmed and the rest of the voyage was :
devoid of incident, light winds prevailing \
almost to this port. William Kelly, a sea
man, 38 years of age and a native of the
United States, died on April 8 of palsy
and was burled at sea. The Corunna
sighted the French bark Moliere, bound v
from here to Cork, on March 26, in lati
tude 13.08 south, longitude 126.19 west.
When the Corunna dropped her anchor
she was boarded by the usual army of
runners. The runners, with services and
goods to sell, gave Captain McNeil the
customary glad grasp and warm welcome.
The other runners, those dealing /In sail
ors, were unusually warm in their wel
come. They piled aboard the vessel and
so glad were they to welcome the jackies
to oo it, so eager to make their visit to
San* Francisco pleasant, - that- they- fol
lowed the crew aloft, shook the hand "not
busy furling: canvas and pressed to the
lips of the still toiling mariners flasks
loaded with potent red liquor. Captain
McNeill discovered the welcome cere
mony going on aloft, shook himself clear
of the men with things to sell and ordered
all hands on deck. He ordered the wel

still very scarce on the beach, but the

MADRID, May 3.â Advices from the
Portuguese frontier Indicate that the sit
uation in Portugal is becoming extremely
grave in consequence of the excitement
caused by the bill passed D" the Cham
ber of Deputies approving the calling of
a convention of Portugal's creditors for
the purpose of converting the foreign
debt. Members of the Portuguese army
and navy are joining the popular pro
tests. All telegrams from Portugal are
censored.
Situation Grave in Portugal.
Â¦There are now fifty of them, requiring
the constant gathering of scales from tho
department grounds for food. "While not
expecting the scales to be exterminated
from this country, experts are planning
to attack them with the Increasing breed
of their natural enemies.
WASHINGTON, May 3.â The Depart
ment of Agriculture is preparing to fight
the ravages of the San Jose * scalQ
throughout the country with Its natural
enemy, the ladybug, brought from the
Interior of China. Assistant Botanist
Starlatt has just returned irom the Ori
ent, where he sought the original home of
the dreaded scale. Far in the Interior of
the latter country, wherÂ« European plants
had not penetrated, he found the scales
and also the ladybugs, which kept the
scales in subjugation and permitted the
native plants to flourish. Marlatt started
home with a good supply of these lady
bugs,' but only sixteen survived on ar
rival in this country, and fourteen of
these subsequently died. The two re
maining, however, were nursed carefully
by the Government with a view to fight
ing the scale ln the same manner as in
China.

. The Leading Specialist.
Â£ o â o
E M O treatment other than that
> B x. v which restores absolute^
h health and soundness can
N be classed as successful treatment.
| Methods that afford merely tem-
3 porary relief are, in most in-
3 stances, not only undesirable, but
1 positively harmful. Especially is
I this true in cases of so-called
I "weakness." I treat no case for
I temporary effects, but direct all
I my efforts toward the accomplish-
| ment of complete and permanent
i cures. It is because my methods
I are successful and actually brin^
j such cures that my practice has
h grown to be the larsrest of its
S kind in the entire West.
I "Weakness." ;
That disorder commonly known as
"â¢Â¦weakness" has for years and genera-
tions baffled the efforts of physicians,
yet to this very day a majority of doc-
tors, SDecialists not excented. are at-
tcniDUng to overcome it by methods
that have been In constant use j and
that have constantly failed for half a
century. They dose the system with
powenul stimulants and tonics calcu-
lated to restore nervous force or
etrengrth that is not and never has
been lacklnxr, with a result that the
functions are temporarily excited t->
the positive detriment of the patient.
Weakness (we will call It such lor con- -
venlence just now) is only a symptoih
i resuHinK from a chronically swollen !
\ and inflamed prostate eland, and is Â¦
! curable by local treatment only. j
i Kither early dissination or some Im- !
I properly treated contracted disease Is \
I responsible for the inflammation in , |
most instances, though accidental in- t j
jury. Etrain, etc., may produce th* g|
same result. I have permanently
cured thousands of cases of premature-
ness, Iofs of pov.-er, etc.. without the
giving of a single Internal dose, which
demonstrates the absolute accuracy of J
my -understanding: and treatment of the
disorder. In years I have not met
v.-ith a sinsle failure, and I have en-
tire confidence in my ability to cure
all cases that come to me for treat-
ment. I am equally certain that no
treatment other than that which I
hav*- perfected can completely and per-
manently restore strength and vigor.
My success in curing "weakness" has
led others to imitate me. even to the
extent cf copying my advertisements,
word for word, thus forcing me to seek
copvritrht protection. I mention this
lor "your safety, as the treatment toid
cf in my announcements is rendered
â¢ by no physician other than myself.

The ladies in charge of Tyrone booth at
the Irish Fair will give an excursion to
the United States battleship "Wisconsin
to-day. Launches will leave Folsom
street wharf between 1 and 5 p. m. Vol
unteer guides will show visitors over the
big fighting machine.
Will Visit the Battleship.
The ladies of the booth intend to give
an evening at home some night this
.week,, on which occasion there will be
singing by -Miss May Macdonald. The
officers of the booth are: Mrs. E. E.
Schmitz, president; Mrs. Albert Burns,
vice president; Mrs. Phil E. Kiley, secre
tary, and Mrs, D. F. Keith, treasurer.
The knights in armor guarding the old
castle immediately facing the entrance
attracted â¢ considerable attention, last
night. The scene is quite realistic and all
who are interested in the fifteenth cen
tury style of armor will find the exhibit
worthy of inspection. The Pavilion re
mains closed to-day.
The Dublin booth was especially attrac
tive last night. The ladles are working
hard to make it one of the most beautiful
of the fair and their efforts are succeed
ing. - The decorations are pretty, being
all In green and yellow, whileV palms
placed here and there - add much to .the
artistic effect. Mrs. E. E. Schmitz has
donated a magnificent diamond sunburst,
the, chances being sold for 25 cents and
the cards disappeared with wonderful
rapidity. Mrs. Noonan has donated sev
eral valuable â¢Â¦Â¦ pieces of furniture, ' and
Mrs. Klley, the secretary, , has presented
some beautiful i>ahns. . ' -
Another entertaining feature was the
Irish jaunting car just Imported from
Ireland. This vehicle, the like of which
hac not been se m. here in public, was in
constant use throughout the evening. Tho
horse had a serious time of it until nearly
11 o'clock, when the driver concluded to
call tt a day. In the gallery above the
crossroads, dances, which are so charm
ing a feature of Irish provincial life, went
on without intermission. AH of the con
cessionaires did a big -- business In the
evening, the crowd being in a mood that
prompted a lively disbursement of funds
wherever entertainment was offered.
The main amusement of the evening
was the watching of daring young men
as they kissed the Blarney stone. This
was no fake affair, but the stone itself,
which is about the size of a walnut, was
taken by a prelate from the identical ruin
in whicn tne famed. Blarney stone is
tixed and brought to this city for service
at the fair. It was placed in position on
the wall of tl* ruin at a height of about
thirty feet, and to reach It one is obliged
to hang by his heels,' which are held by
two lusty youths. Only two young men
dared to kiss the stone last night, but the
applause that greeted thenj. amply repaid
tnem for the risk they took of breaking
their necks. â¢ ' : '
. . during the evening. | Exceptionally
interesting amusements were provided for
visitors, so that time did not hang heavy
on; any one's hands. i
The various booths were brilliant with
lights and beauty.^ The young women in
charge appeared at, their best and all
were indefatigable In. their efforts fo
please visitors. Such - as had spare dimes
were speedily relieved of them with their
consent in the cause of sweet charity,
and those who failed to win prizes on the
chances taken \>y them failed to register
their protests. . , . '.: Â¦
IT was everybody's night at the Irish
Fair in the Pavilion --last night. "It

secured a warrant from Judge Cabaniss
yesterday for the arrest of Gust Optz on
a charge of obtaining money by false pre
tenses. Savage alleges that on April 20
he paid Optz $100 for an interest in the
real estate and agency business of Gus
Strand & Co., 203 Kearny street, on thn
representation that the business was
bringing in $150 per month profit. In this
he claims he was deceived. Optz was ar

A sensation was caused when Kittie
Nihill, one of the defendants on anpther
charge, was called as a witness for the
prosecution. It was expected that she
would turn State's evidence, but her tes
timony was not as strong as was expect
ed. She testified that she lived at 945
Folsom street and had been stopping with
her eister, Annie Barker, for two days at
the Howard-street house when the police
made the raid. She had saen the tel
escope basket in the room thai was occu
pied by King and Hamilton, who she
thought had brought It there. Barker and
his wife had not been out that night to
her knowledge, but she admitted she had
been asleep and was awakened by the
entrance of King and Hamilton from the
rear. The articles taken from the basket
ivere piled up in their room. She did not
know if King and Hamilton left the house
again. Her cross-examination was de
ferred till to-morrow morning.
Mrs. Murray identified the telescope
basket and contents as her property, and
Mrs. Annie Morrison, her landlady, testl
lied to having seen Hamilton in the house
about the time of the burglary. Police
man H. P. Braig, who followed Hamilton
from the house and saw him join a man
and a woman on Geary street, thereafter
following them till he saw them enter the
house at &3oB Howard street, where they
were arrested, testified to these facts. A.
Amiot. jeweler, 112 Sutter street, cor
roborated Braig.

ing into the rooms of Mrs. Anna Murray

of April 24 and stealing a telescope bas
ket containing a lot of clothing and other
articles was commenced before Judge Mo
gan yesterday. Assistant District Attor

ants were represented by Attorney
Archie Campbell and others. King toolc
part in the cross-examination of the wit
nesses and displayed considerable skill.

The two burglars were noticed the night
before the burglary hiding in a doorway
close to the store by one of Morse's men s
and when they noticed that he was
watching them they ran away. A hack
man saw them break the window and run
away with the silverware, but he was too
paralyzed by the daring of the act to give
an alarm in time.
Detectives Regan and O'Connell of the
local force learned Friday that a young
man had been trying to sell a lot of sil
verware cheap at Sixth and Howard
streets in two places. They got a good
description of the man and notified police
headquarters. Morse's- men got a clew
about the same time, and yesterday Cal
lundan and Cleary saw Donnelly with the
satchel at Market and Powell streets and
at once placed him under arrest. They
are now searching for Donnelly's com
panion.
When arrested Donnelly was carrying
a satchel containing all the silverware
stolen from' the window, consisting" of
12 teaspoons. 12 tablespoons. 11 coffee
spoons, 12 dessert forks, 12 icecream
spoons, 12 dessert knives, 12 medium sized
knives, 12 butter knives. 1 soup ladle, 1
gravy ladle, 1 fish knife, 1 salad spoon
and fork and carving set. The lot is val
ued at $275. and Donnelly had been offer
ing to sell it for $40.
One of the two men who broke the
plate glass window in the store of W. K.
Vandersliee & Co., jewelers, 136 Sutter
street, last Wednesday night was arreste-l
yesterday about noon at Market and
Powell streets by Captain Callundan and
Detective Cleary of Morse's agency and
booked at the City' Prison on a charge of
burglary. He gave the name of John
Smith, but was later recognized as John
Donnelly, who was a hanger-on at a sa
loon at Sixth and Clara streets.

The crime was caused by the disappear
ance of a .dog- which, belonged to Fla
herty's wife. She claimed that she had
lost the animal in Umland's saloon and :^o
informed Flaherty, who went to the sa
loon, demanding the animal on pain, of
death to all in the saloon. Roller jumped
from" his chair^to prevent trouble and
grabbed hold of Flaherty, who fatally
shot him, afterward firing a shot at Um
land. â¢'. '
The case was called at 11 . o'clock yes
terday morning, when Judge Cook
charged the jury. That- body retired
about 11:30 .o'clock, and. the Judge an
nounced that he would return at 2:30.
as the jurors said they expected to reach
a verdict without going out to lunch. The
Judge returned at the time mentioned and
was notified that the jury . had agreed.
The Judge took His seat on the bench, but
the -defendant's attorney, Frank J. Mur.
phy; was not;present. After/waiting- for
nearly half an hour the Judge instructed

"The Monitor" Shows lip
the Dishonest Methods
of a Rival,
All the leading newspapers have ral-
lied to Mr. George Mayerle's assist-
ance in the annoying circumstances
which have been forced upon him.
CAIXS IT PIBACY.
The Monitor, the leading Catholic
newspaper of the Pacific Coast, in its
issue of May 3d, on page 97, says: "An
instance of business piracy unparal-
leled in this city's commercial history,
whereby an attempt was made to rob
an enterprising optician of the fruits of
his intelligence and experience, has
come to light. The offended party, is
George Mayerle of 1071 Market street,
whose ability in his profession has won
for him the public encomiums of men
enjoying the highest positions in the
country. . Mr.. Mayerle, Jj by reason of
his honesty and skill, has won a large
and rapidly increasing clientele. His
success attracted the envy of certain
parties, who secured a store next door
to Mr. Mayerle's, and, by making its
appearance very similar to \ his, con-
fused a number of persons. The firm
that used this contemptible means of
winning success styles itself 'Mayerle
& Co.' It has absolutely no connec-
tion with the optical institute conduct^
ed by George Mayerle, the number
Â«jpf 'whose establishment is 1071 Market
street. Those who intend visiting the
latter's establishment should, to avoid
mistakes, look for the full name.;
George Mayerle. and a crown , on
every .window; also the number, 1071."

The toastmaster then proposed the toast
of the "United States Navy" and called
upon Rear Admiral Henry Glass to re
spond. Rear Admiral Glass in replying
said: â¢
SPEAKS OF GALLANTRY.
Mr. President and Gentlemen: I esteem It a
great honor to be called upon to respond to the
toast of the "Navy" before the Union League
Club, but I regret that the very short notice
given me has not .allowed me -to prepare ,re; ;
marks at 'all worthy of so important and inter
esting a subject as thÂ£- navy Â©t ..the -United
States.
I might speak of the gallantry 'and devotion
to duty shown by the men and officers of our
navy from the day when the American flag
â¢was first hoisted on board a vessel of war down
to the brilliant victories of Manila and San
tiago, the twp actions which In themselves
closed a war and established the United States
as a naval power of the first rank.
But the achievements of the navy are known
to the world and are recited with pride by the
youngest scholars in our broad, land. I may
claim, however, that the same high courage
and readiness for any duty that were shown by
Paul Junes, Decatur, Stewart, Perry and all
the long list of men who have given their lives
to the country's service in times of need, and
who have Illustrated some of the .brightest
pages of our history, actuate to-day the man
behind the gun. And he is as ready to respond
to the call of duty, whether serving in the bat
tleship or torpedo-boat, as he was in the glo
rious days when "Old Ironsides" met and van
quished her gallant foes. The traditions of the
old navy are cherished and kept alive by the
man of the forecastle as by him of the quarter
deck.
All our history tells us of the actions in
which our ships have engaged and of the cour
age and endurance In the course of duty of the
men who served in them. but. outside of the
navy, far too little is known of the men who
designed and built those ships to carry our flag
tc victory, or sometimes to defeats as glorious
as any victory. How they did their work and
what the country owes to them I will try to
recount briefly In the time allotted me this
evening.
- The history of the building of our navy may
be broadly divided into three great periods, In
each of which have American vessels compared
ship to ship more than favorably with those ot
the leading naval powers of the world. . First
came the era of the great sailing frigates â the
Constitution. United States. Constellation â
whose models led the world In grace' ancl
beauty, and whose superior gunpowder made
them more than a match for any ships of their
class afloat. These vessels for sea-gotng quali
ties have never been surpassed and they were
the forerunners of the famous American clipper
nhrps. Then came -.a transition period, -when
efforts were made, and successfully for the
time', to combine the new power. ' steam, with
the graceful equipment of the full-rigged sail
ing ship, and 1858 saw the American flag car
ried by the Wabash. Merrimac and others that
were aptly designated by an able British writer
as battleships in the disguise of frigates.
DESIGNERS LEAD THE WORLD.
Again had American designers and ordnance
officers led the world In. the type of 6hips put
afloat and armed by our country. --And as Imi
tatloln is the sincerest form of flattery we may
recall with pride that the great naval powers of
Europe hastened to build . vessels as nearly
equal to them as possible. - â¢ *
With the civil war in 1861 there was seen
at once the need of vessels of a new and more
powerful type to meet the conditions of that
time, and the Monitor, the typical mastless
General Barnes Says
Party Must Be
Unified.
Ironclad, was' produced by the genius of John
Erlckson and the skill of American mechanics.
And well was she^ named the Monitor, as
she taught to all nations a new chapter in the
building of warships and a revolution In ship
designing was made. From the day when she
met the Merrlmac. in Hampton Roads and
checked her career of destruction. 1 no vessel
of war has been commissioned under any flag
whose construction and arrangement of^battery
have not been largely Influenced by the achieve
ments of the -â¢'cheese box on a raft." as the
Monitor was at first somewhat contemptuous
ly styled. â¢ . Â¦ . .. -
â¢At the close of the civil war. the United
States had In commission the most , efficient
fleet in the world for the special purposes for
which It had bsen created, but then for many
years the navy stood still, and to stand" still
was to recede from the proud position we l^eld
until our country was about the twentieth In
rank among nations maintaining a naval force.
Vessel after vessel' was sold, or worn -out -In
the service assigned and dropped from the
list. until we. had me bare skele
ton ot a - -navy. The old castlron
guns that had. been heard at Mobile, Charleston
and Fort Fisher were' gradually rusting away
in our navy, yards, or at best serving for drill
purposes and in keeping alive tbÂ« feeling of
readiness to do any and Â¦ all duty demanded
of men and .of fleers. . .-v ;-
But, gentlemen, -'our country is, and must
always be, a- naval power, and all Americans
â¢love jthÂ«Â» navy, and are proud of* Its, history.
We who. in, the. dark days from 1S66 to 1886,
had often to 'apologize for the character of the
ships representing the country on foreign sta
tion*, knew, that the time most come when
we wouM. again be serving -in ships In -which
we could feel all a seaman> pride. -ships that
would carry-.. the flag with honor, and challenge
the admiration or the world. *â¢'â¢-. â¢â¢â¢â¢Â¦ >â¢., 'tftZ-r?-
In the .meantime; the men and A efJJe*raix>/ the
navy. did the duty that came to them.. growl-
Jng..at -tlmee. 1 as -sailors must, but preparing
themselves for. the better time coming. - - :-\- .
' -.At last 'the', day of battleships and powerful
cruisers dawned for us and again the Ameri
can, designer and shipwright were ready for
the new conditions. At first we were content
to purchase . abroad a few plans of ships that
had been successful and to duplicate them, with
many â¢ improvements that were at onceÂ» sug
gest**!.. but that time was, soon past and the
American naval constructor designed the Ore
gon and her class, vessels which at once placed
us in the:front rank in shipbuilding and which
for their tonnage have not yet been equalled
b 5.. a r y j nntlol> - " These vesse 's were at first
criticized as having too many and too heavy
guns, leading 1 characteristics of American men
of-war of the past, and, as being deficient- In
speed;/ how ill-Judged were such criticisms waa
shown at Santiago.
We have- not .been content, however, to fol
low a. beaten track, easy and sure of success
as it might seem, and the motto of the service
has been "Onward and upward." - The works
on the shore of San Francisco Bay that sent
the Oregon on her career of success under every
trial,^ and at .last to victory. Is now building
for the country ships as superior to her In all
round efficiency, as that splendid vessel was to
the double ;turreted monitor of 1864. And the
designs of .those ships are as carefully studied
of y i79 r 8lnd"%8! "^ gfe$% the Â»^Â«'Â»
In speaking -of the navy, then let us re
member with honor the American naval con
structor and ; the American, skilled mechanic
who have given to the men afloat the ships that
have carried our flag to victory; ships that will
always -be a. sure defense for the honor and
security of our country. ,

ovation when called upon- to speak to the
toast of "San Francisco and Her Future "

two hours the diners enjoyed a. bounteous
feast.
liBINK PRESIDENT'S HEALTH.
Shortly after 10 p. m. Colonel George H.
PlPI>>% president of the Union League
Club, called for order. The guests present
concentrated their attention on those
seated at the head of the horseshoe table-
Colonel George H. Plppy. Admiral Henry
Glass. Admiral Silas Casey, General R. P.
Hughes, Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz, Gen
<?ral "W. H. 1Â». Barnes and Collector of the
Port F. S. Stratton.
Colonel Pippy, the toastmaster, proposed
the health of the President. of the United
States and called upon Collector of the
Port F. S. Etratton to respond.
The health of President Roosevelt was
drunk in a rising toast and Collector
Stratton, in responding, dwelt upon the
general prosperity of the country and re
ferred to the passage of the Chinese ex
clusion bill and the increased tonnage of
the port of San Francisco. He claimed
that the good times were due to the Re
publican party and the prestige in the
Orient of the United States. Collector
Etrattcn told of the possibilities of this
country in the future and the hoped for
Increase in the American marine. He
contended that every pledge of the- Re
publican party for reform and progress
had been carried out and that under the
flag of the disciples of that party the
"United States would go forward as one
of the greatest powers "of the world, rep
resentative of freedom and advancement.
- Colonel Pippy then toasted the "Army
srnd Navy." which was drunk by the as
sembled jruests. When the cheers, sub
sided the toastmaster called upon General
Robert P. Hughes of the United States
army. Department of California, to re
spond to the toast for "The Army of the
United States."
General Hughes received a flattering re
ception. In replying to the toast he said:

that I had been made a member of your body,
and two days ago I *?ot a note to this ef

Bpcn'I to the toa*t. 'The United States Army.' "
I had bocn ir. a good many places in my
forty-one years of sen-ice, but I never was put
in quite such a pickle before. I never made a
rpeÂ«ch in my life and I would rather do any
thing elfe. but in behalf of my fellow-eoldiÂ»rs
I v-iEh to cay this much for thÂ»>m. The army

ThÂ«>w> oommlEEions were triven to him by the
Continental Congrees in Philadelphia. Mark
it well, he old not issue.all the commissions
that were given to him. He selected those

CHARGES WOMAN

officers of the army and navy who are pres
ent, that there Is no spot of earth where they
can be more welcome, no place where the rec
ords, they have helped to make are more cher
ished than in organizations such as this which
exist all over the United States. They are the
most liberty-loving of men. They are the
men who. will do. as they have always done,
their full duty by the nation and by the Gov
ernment. ' And although dissensions may arise
sometimes, though sometimes the boss, whom,
the Mayor is so afraid of. will come to the
front from time to-time, he will be as ephe
meral as "the moth that flutters- around the
blaze, and the nearer the boss comes to the
blaze of liberty the more he will be singed
and finally he will be consumed in it. .
THERE MUST BE LEADERS.
There ought to be no such things as bosses,
but there roust be leaders. As in the game of
football, where boys with organization and
team work will walk right over a team of
giants without organization and leadership and
make a goal every time they try. so it is in
politics. - We have' got to have organization,
we have got to move together. We have got
to practice the art of politics. The great pop
ular heart will be for what is right, when
they are shown the right, and they will be
shown It: but from now until the end of time
we cannot get along without leaders. That la
one of the great troubles to-day in Congress.
We have no real avowed leader of the Repub
lican party in either the Senate or House of
Representatives. You see It to-day in the di
vision of that party upon questions and the
lack of sufficient support of the administration,
and I wish -we had in both houses of Congress
some real good old-fashioned American boss
to whip the party into line and make it go
right along. (Applause.)
All bosses are corruptâ they can't help It.
They can't win without it. They never have
and never will. It is not so much the way
you win a fight as the way you behave your
self : after the fight is won. I felt that in
Mayor Schmitz's campaign there were a great
many things I did cot approve, but when the
Mayor got his seat and conducted himself In
the manly < and straightforward spirit by which,
he has won so many encomiums from men
of all sorts and creeds I would bÂ« will
ing to accept him for a boss. I wouldn't care,
Mr. Mayor, if you would accept that position,
if you would cram the ballot box to carry the
primaries. I wouldn't care If you programmed
every man who came in. I know you will pro
gramme him right, and when you lay down the
law for him if he doesn't go right you will ra
move him â or you will try to.
SHOULD MEET FREQUENTLY.
I wish to say in conclusion that meetings
like this are most delightful and we should
have more of them. This club ought not to
assemble as infrequently aa it does.. Its power
and its influence ought to be more felt. It . la
full 'Of. strong men and good ' men. Â¦ whose In
fluence and power ought to be felt in this com
munity and In the party for good.- and we can
only do it by standing together and submitting
to the will and common sense of the party aa
it is expressed in its convention and solng like
men when election day comes and voting the
ticket.' I want" to say here for the benefit of
the guests that the "worse Republican I ever
saw is better than the best Democrat. (Laugh
ter.) , And so in this coming campaign, what
ever ' may ' be oar individual : preferences,
whenever the common sense of the party
in convention assembled -.- shall have de
termined what is best ! for the party,
thim club, like every other bodw- > of sen
sible and patriotic men, should have no kick
ers and no knockers. I .think that is one
thing in which this State -needs cultivation.
You -don't find it so anywhere else. .You let a
man go from an Eastern State to Congress
and -make himself of use there and they keÂ«-D
him there. But you send a man to Congreu
from this State and he has to" keep one eye
on the speaker and the other over his shoulders
and his ears laid back flat on his head to see
who is working to throw him out tn California.
It is wrong to do that. If you have good- men
there keen them there. . '
I give yon as the closing sentiment the name
of this club â a league for the union of good
men. of sound principles, of faith and honesty
of man and respect for God. (Great applause.)

Captures the Kentucky Derby, 'in
Which Abe Frank Is Last.
LOUISVILLE, May 3.â To the lusty
cheers of thousands, Alan-a-Dale, ' the
gedo son of Halma, the latter himself
winner of the 1895 Derby, this afternoon
passed under the wire winner of the
twenty-eighth Kentucky Derby. The at
tendance was enormous. Abe Frank, the
much-heralded winter favorite, was the
choice in the betting at 3 to 5.
After several attempts they were sent
away on comparatively even terms, with
A!an-a-Dale a neck in front of Abe
Frank, The Rival third and Inventor, last.
At the stand Alan-a-Dale was a length in
front of Frank, The Rival third and In
ventor last, but jainning under a strong
pull. Around the lower turn they shot,
with the chestnut son of Halma still
showing the way. The gap was gradu
ally lengthened down the backstrefch un
til Winkfleld had a half-dozen lengths of
daylight between his mount and Abe
Frank, the favorite, The Rival still being
third. As they rounded the last turn for
the final run into the , stretch Coburn
went to work on the favorite, but Abe
did not have the run in him. When the
stretch had been reached Abe : showed
signs of distress and was palpably beat
en. The race was now between the Mc-
Dowell entry and Inventor, the latter
showing a burst of speed at the finish
that for a time seemed to threaten Alan
a-Dale, but Winkfield, without whip or
spur, 6ent the son of Halma under the
wire a winner by a length,"with his sta
ble companion fighting for second place a
neck behind Inventor. Abe Frank was
six lengths away. Summary:.- j s

Nordyke hit the ball flush on the nose.
He secured two double-sackers out of two
limes up and scored half the runs. Leahy
and Anderson made three hits each. Wad
dell looked after things in good etyle at
first. The game was not a particularly
brilliant cne and the errors made were
rank and costly in every instance. Holly
played a steady, consistent game at short.
Lawler used poor judgment when flies
came out in his direction. The score:
After Bone had struck out in the fifth,
JCordyke lined a hot two-bagger to the
Scoreboard. Toman fumbled Holly's
grounder and Dyke landed on third. Dyke
scored on Rayraer's error of Shugart's
grounder and Shugart soon followed on
Leahy's single to right field. Two more
men came home in the seventh on doubles
by Nordyke and Leahy, Shugart's single
and a wild pitch by Slagle.
The Angels made their only circle in the
Becond explosion. Reilly got a scratch hit
past third and Anderson Bent him to sec
ond with a single past short. Roach
bunted and Glendon threw to Shugart,
who let the ball pass him. Reilly scored,
but Atiderson was luckily nabbed as he
slid for the plate.
Martin Glendon, the latest addition to
the Harris" stable, passed out his assprt
ment for inspection by the Morley contin
gent. He had a good stock of curves and
a bewildering change of speed, and
though hit safely nine times, he succeeded
in keeping them well mixed through 'xhe
nine innings. The Angels would have
been shut out had it not been for Snu
g-art's misplay in the second.
Slagle, the youngster who did pitching
stunts for the southerners, acted well and
if his support had been up to the standard
of his work the score would undoubtedly
have been more even. The Angels ran
bases like a lot of kitchen maids, while
Toman at short has three black marks on
bis error book.
Jim Morley has again been forced to
drink of the bitter dope known as defeat.
All the pipe dreams of_the south have dis
sipated into thin air. The proud Angels,
who left the land of orange groves and
rooters with their chest inflated and con
talk about victory on their lips, have sud
denly realized that they are duck soup
when Rube is not shooting the ball. Yes
terday the score stood 4 to 1 and the
Ponies owned the 4. . ' , â¢ . Â¦

PHILADELPHIA. May 3.â Senator
Manna, who is visiting C. A. Grls
com. at the latter* s country seat in
Haverford, a suburb of this city, had
retired when the statement issued to
night In New Tork by President Mitchell
of the United Mine Workers was re
ceived here. Early in the evening, how
ever, in answer to questions the Senator
said he had not yet received a. report
from the sub-committee of the concilia
tion committee. He added:
Until I have that report in hand I cannot
ray when I can can a. meeting- of the renerai
committee. If at all. The. conciliation commit
tee was successful in bringing employers and
employes together, which was Impossible a year
ego. Having done this the committee can do
no more unless both sides ask us to arbitrate
some Epecific point. ->-:
Several minor differences have been adjusted
in the conference â little things that hardly
amounted to grievances and that only required
being made known and explained to have them
adjusted. Three principles have been laid down
by the labor people â that no sympathetic strike
Ehould be entered Into: no Interference with
people who want to work and no curtailment
of production to drive prices up.
The executive committee of the three anthra
cite coal districts of the United Mine Workers
vt America. In whom is vested the authority
to inaugurate a strike, have been notified to
assemble at Scrantoa. l*a., at 10 a. m.,
Wednesday, May V. This committee consists
of twenty-eight members appointed from the
three districts, and should a majority of them
vote In lavor of a strike the entire 147.0U0
mine workers will immediately refpond to the
call.
Mitchell was asked if he would say what
occurred at the recent conference between
representatives of the miners and the ope
rators. ; He replied that there was little to
tell except that the operators had refused
to jjrant any concessions whatever to the
men. They would not agree that wages
should be raised, that working hours
should be reduced or that coal should be
weighed at the pit mouth- It was sug
gested to Mitchell that it looked very
much, as If a strike was imminent.
-Well." he replied, "it looks very
threatening.' '
There are In the miners' organization
about 147,000 anthracite coal miners, who
will be affected if a strike is declare'd.
There are also about 37,000 soft coal min
ers, many of whom belong to the union,
und who could be induced to join the an
thracite miners should there be a strike.
Whether that will be done, and the
bituminous as well as anthracite coal
trade tied up, Mitchell said he could not
say. President Mitchell pointed out that
the National Civic Federation had accom
plished the object for which it was
formed when it brought the employers
and the men together. "The only other
function of the federation," said Mitchell,
"is to arbitrate when asked to do so by
both parties to a disagreement. I cannot
say what would be done by the United
Mine Workers, and in any event the good
offices of the \ federation to arbitrate
would not be asked until after the execu
tive committee of the Mine Workers has
met at Scranton."
NEW YORK, May 3.â President John
Mitchell of the United Mine Workers of
America gave out the following statement
to-night regarding the secret conference
between his organization and the coal
operators:

WASHINGTON. May 3.-The death of
Representative Amos J. Cummings of
New York in Baltimore last night caused
general regret and sorrow in the House
of Representatives to-day. Above the hall
the flag fluttered at half-mast and on the
floor the old familiar desk in tho center

drape'd in black and covered with a pro
fusion of purple orchids and spring flow

..A month ago he dropped some remarks
about , ; his . part 'in a Â¦ trlT^edy at Â¦ Venita. .
The report .was carried to Sheriff- Si bley,;
who -ascertained that he- was .under, in-.
dictment -and wanted for murder. Last
Thursday he attended a- picnic, at. Clem-'

uty sheriff: had': been inquiring for .him.'
He left the grounds on a wheel and since,
then - ihe ! officers . have . been " scouring -, the
country for him.
To-day ' Sibley came on him at the rail-,
road station just as he was about to.
board. a' car. He surrendered without pro-;
test, and told the, Sheriff that he. knew
he was after^him and was starting back
East to give himself â¢ up. The accused
man is but' 26 years old, and claims. that
he did the killing in 'self-defense, -but fled
for fear that he couldnot get l a' fair trial*
owing to political .feeling.

"Newton admitted," Mr. Hougham said,
"that there was a mechanical 'why,' but
he had failed to find it, and claimed the
discovery of a mathematical 'why* I
claim to have discovered the mechanical
â¢why' and can materially demonstrate,
mechanically illustrate and mathemati
cally prove it."
Mr.Hougham's theory of motion is ex
actly contradictory to tlie present one;
the present theory is "evolution from a
center to the outer world." His theory
Is "Involution toward a common center."
After forty years of experimenting and
study Mr. Hougham claims to have dis
covered the mechanical and^mathematical
principles in which electric heat and other
forces of matter both materialized .and

STOCK SWINGLE
CATCHES BANKS
Warrants Are Issued
. for Wail- Street
Operators.
Ldsses of Sixty Financial
Concerns Exceed Mil
lion Dollars.
NEW YORK; May 3.â The slump in th*
stock market, affecting what is known on
the "street" a3 the Webb-Meyer stocks,
was followed late to-day by a story that
warrants had been issued for the arrest
of one or more persons in this connection.
The story was that the order of arrest
was issued upon an affidavit made by a
Wall street operator, who claimed to have
been fleeced, and further affidavits by
members and employes of various firms,
who alleged they knew the secrets of the
deal. It was further said that, from in
formation placed in the hands of Pierre
M. Brown, an attorney, it was alleged that
sixty banks in different parts of the coun
try are out more than $1,000,000 through
stock manipulations, and the total loss
at stake is placed at from $3,000,000 to
$10,000,000. It was asserted that Justice
Gegeirich of the Supreme Court had is
sued the warrants. He could not be found
to verify the statement until late to-night,
when he said:
So far as I can remember, the statements
which have been made are true and the Quo
tation of the affidavit la correct, though it
must be remembered that I have a great many
papers to deal with in the course of a day â of
an I hour â and, without - having them at hand,
cannot be too certain as to what they contain.
The order of ' arrest was made for only one
man, although I had signed four.
The methods by which the "wash sales'*
were undertaken, it is said, are given in
the affidavit as follows: Â¦ __
Orders would be given to several brokers
to sell, the stocks at given figures and
orders would simultaneously be given to
other brokers to buy these stocks so that
the purchases by the last lot would be
made from the first. In this manner
prices were reported of supposed sales,
all of the sales and purchases being made
for the same persons.
The affidavit, it is said, mentions a num
ber of banks located in this city, Boston.
Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago and
other cities which are alleged to have
made loans on some of the stocks.
It is stated positively that Dr. Webb i3
not charged with any offense in connec
tion with the application for the warrant,
or that he received any benefit from the
alleged fraudulent transactions. Up to -a.
late hour to-night no arrest has been
made.
Joseph Hoadley, president of the Inter
national Power Company, to-night re
ceived a letter from Dr. Seward Webb,
tendering his resignation as a member of
the board of directors. Mr. Hoadley said
the resignation would be accepted.

ticed complimentary notices in the fra
ternal department of The Call in relation

ficials. There were interesting talks by

THE DRUIDS.
- Several of t ne parlors have levied* an
aseessment of 50 cents in aid of. the en
tertainment fund, but many of the mem
bers of such parlors have declared " that
they will not pay the assessment on the
ground that there is no authority to levy
such, notwithstanding that the grand
president' has declared in a- decision that
such^an assessment can be levied if a
parlor so decides by a mljority vote.
_ Some one has suggested that the Grand
Parlor that is to - meet in this city in
June adjourn in time to Â¦ allow the rep
resentatives to go. "slumming" through
Chinatown.. Grand Vice President knz*
D. Keith has declared herself against
such a proposition. She says that the
order of Native Daughters of the Golden
West, which was formed for the purpos*
of upholding all that is good, should not
place the seal of official recognition upon
the plague spot of San Francisco, ana
at M n^ he V, ontrary a-11 loyal citizens
should, do all they â¢ can ; to obliterate
rather than- perpetuate a hideous spot as
an attraction for tourists or a holiday
trip for the visiting Native Daughters.
During the past year Miss Frakes, the
grand secretary, has received a numbÂ°r
of letter, congratulating her upon the
P K. n 5 ed Proceedings and her good work as
chief scribe of the order, but Alta Parlor
has the proud distinction of being th*
first 'to send the grand secretary an- offi
cial letter of thanks and praise.
1 J tie l followin S named , were visitors at
the office of the grand secretary during
the- past week: Emma Gruber Foley,
Orinda Parlor; Dr. Florence A. Temple
Darina^Parlor; Dolly P. Hyams, Sans
Ucl M ParIor; Mrs - M ary Valerite, city:
Mrs. Mary T Capurro, city; Lillie Borle and
Mrs. Kate Lester of Genevieve Baker Par
lor; .Myrtle Harp of Angelita Parlor; E.
D. Keith grand vice president; Hannah
Bailey of Darina Parlor.
. Alta Parlor discussed the , proposition to'
levy an assessment on the members to
raise a fund for the entertainment of the
grand officers and delegates, and con
cluded that such an assessment could not
be levied, but wishing to help the project
the parlor donated $100 toward the fund.
Orinda Parlor got over the assessment
proposition 1 by. voting $25- to the enter
tainment fund. ' -
The. announcement that, Darina Parlor
had placed- itself on record against the
proposed assessment of SO cents per cap
ita for the purpose, of raising a i fund to
entertain the grand officer* and delegates
to the Grand Parlor was premature. . It
should have been that ; the' parlor pro
poses to take the ' matter ' under eon.slcK
eration, and that the authority of the
joint. committee to levy such an assess,
ment ..will be: fully discussed before any
action is taken thereon. < Â¦
': The Native Daughters of the Golden
West are busy. at this time electing del
egates : to the Grand Parlor.

As a result of observations and practical experience, I have been convinced that

ADVEBTISEMENTS.'
MARRIAGE AND MCCESS:
yBy MARGARET. L. BRIGGS. ,
Â£ . '_ (ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.)
~*'A man who wants to succeed has no right to get married," is a re-
mark we hear only too often. "Women Tesent it,. but that "does not alter the
fact that there Is a great deal of ; truth in the statement, that. the man who
does not get married succeeds far .qftener than the man who does. And it
is due to this fact that the number of unmarried men is increasing yearly.
Ignore the facts as we may, no woman can deny that It seriously handi-
caps a man in life to marry before he has reached the goal of his ambitions.
And'this, in face of the well-known truth, that a man often owes his success
to a- woman. â¢ Â¦ '
Look around the world and carefully consider the men who gave great-
est/promise in their youth, and are such dismal failures now. If the
result of your observations agrees with mine, every one' of these men will
have a. wife who Is always ailing, always complaining, 'a' wife who is ner-
vous and irritable. The man worries over his business. all day, then goes
home at night to hear her complaints and to give her his sympathy. "He
tries hard to induce her to go to the doctor, mostvof the time she, will
not, and, indeed, generally, she is right when she says the doctor does not do
her any good, for this woman probably is suffering from some female weak-
ness which doctors do not seem able to cure.
The women of this country are subject to female troubles. The nervous,
excitable, busy â¢ life â¢ of the woman of this generation Invites these
feminine diseases/, unless a woman realizes the importance of keeping well.
Most women do not, however, and it is these women who are always suf-
fering from backaches, . headaches, pains in the side and unnatural dis-
charges, who are a constant worry to their husbands, who continually unfit
the -man for attending to his -work as he should.
The wife who really loves her husband and has his success at heart
will keep herself well with Lydia El Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. -It
cures all the aches and pains to 'which; our sex is so subject, and makes a
woman strong in body and nerves. After .taking Mrs. Pinkham's medicine
a woman becomes a true helpmate to her husband. She frees him from
worry on her account, because the medicine makes her well ; and cheerful,
and the advice and sympathy her health enables her to give helps him on
the road to success. trJt-%.
There are wives without ending who half the time do not know what
work Is being done to provide for their comfort. They have no realization
of the mental strain upon their ! husbands day after day, no idea of the
Herculean efforts they are makihg-1 to reach success. Night after night
these men go home with heads aching from attempts to accomplish impos-
sibilities, only to meet a woman complaining of her housework, about the
children, about her aches and pains. Rarely does the man hear a pleasant
word, the, thing most longed for after the hard day's work.
In these days of competition it is the occasional man who succeeds. If
your, husband is to be one of them he needs all. the support your love can
give him; he needs freedom from worry over you. v >
So, if you are sick, get well. Take Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound. Don't worry your husband with complaints, but write to Mrs.
Pinicham at Lynn, Mass., for her advice. Tell her all your troubles â tell her
about all your pains to the smallest detail. She can be of real help to
you. Her medicine will relieve your suffering. Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound is the great remedy for all the ills of women. If your
monthly illness comes on with pain, or if it comes Irregularly, Mrs.
Pinkham's medicine will cure you. To the expectant .mother it give3
strength for the coming strain upon her system, and after the birth of her
child it brings renewed health. Backache, headache, pain in the side, t . or
that bearing-down feeling that -Is so enervating, are all cured by Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. Inflammation of the ovarian organs and
all unnatural discharges are relieved by it. And with the relief of these
troubles the nervousness and irritation which spoil the lives of these suffer-
ers are^ overcome.
If you feel as though you could not stand the daily trials, if you, feel
like flying to pieces from nervousness, do not blame yourself and say It i3
because you are cross. Do realize that you are sick, and that Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound will cure you. Don't be a woman of whose hus-
band it is said, "He had no right to get married if he wanted to 'succeed."**Eighteen peasants of â¢ the district of
Tscherdlnsk bearing the, family name of
Dyavol (devil) have sent a petition to the
Cxar asking for permission. to change the
name to Bugolubow (God beloved). This
request was granted them.

Of the thousands " of old â¢Â¦' wells In Western
Pennsylvania, very, very few are there that are
doing over a barrel -a <3ay. That man thinks
himself lucky who has drlllable territory cap
able of four-barrel wells â that is, wells which
will do four barrels a day average for. two or
three years. A lease of twenty-three , wgls,
having .Â« production of 200 barrels a month,
sold a few days ago for f 13,000. This is gen
erally regarded as a very good bny, with the
market at fl 15. â¢ Â¦
A correspondent of the Pacific Oil Re
porter writes from Pittsburg, Pa"., that
there Js a general belief in Pennsylvania
that California oil has a bright future.
Their reasons are that the uses for the
various grades of petroleum are rapidly
increasing and that the, product of the
Eastern fields ris diminishing < while '. the
demand for oil is increasing. Of old-time
wells in the East the correspondent says:
FTJTTJBE FOR OIL.
The Los Angeles Herald takes the view
that the operation of the pipeline of the
Standard- Oil Company from Bakersfield
to Point Richmond will have the effect of
giving back the local Los Angeles field to
the producers of that place. "The incu
bus of 15-cent oil." it says, "will be lifted
from Southern California." Hope is also
expressed by the journal mentioned that
the shipments in view to Hawaii by the
Union Oil Company will take out a large
amount of high grade oil from the Whit
tier-Fullerton and Ventura fields. Con
tracts that are concluded have done
much toward absorbing the surplus at
Los Angeles. ' .
This " much Is given out by Secretary
Mason of the Association of California
Municipalities. Meanwhile, the controver
sy, has assumed an acute form in some
parts of the State. The California Dust
less Roads Company, through its presi
dent, F. -W. Mattern, has addressed a let
ter to the Supervisors of San Bernardino
County In which Its claim as applied to
all localities is set forth clearly. In this
communication , the San Bernardino Su
pervisors are notified that any treatment
of roads with crude petroleum oil for the
purpose of laying the dust theredf or for
their betterment without the consent of
and satisfactory compensation of th<i
company "is in violation of the legal
rights of the. undersigned, and consti
tutes an infringement of the exclusive
rights held under. letters patent." In an
other * paragraph the company claims to
be the sole licensee for the State of Cali
fornia* of .the right to treat roads, race
courses, walks, etc., with crude petro
leum.. A report from the committee of
California municipalities is expected soon.
In the month of April there was a fall-
Ing off in the number of wells completed
in California's oil fields as compared with
the records in March. Nevertheless the
production, owing to the showing made
by wells in the Kern River district and at
Carreaga, exceeded that of the previous
month.
TAKES Olt ACUTE PHASE.
Â¦Â¦-'?- The controversy between the towns, and
cities of the Interior of : California -anci
the I owners I of certain j patents for tho
sprinkling of streets and roads with oil iÂ»
about to take on a new phase. A few
years ago an association was formed, or
the municipalities " of California, which
has held annual meetings since "the date
of organization, where topics relative to
the welfare of municipalities have been
discussed.; The purpose has been to co
operate for the -good of all concerned. - .
. The California Dustless Roadbed Com
pany 'claims a 'patent upon oiled roads,
and It has made . demands upon certain
counties that it shall be paid so much per
mile', for the rqatis sprinkled. In Santa
Barbara, where a 'Claim was made for
payment for use of the oil on the high
ways, . the Supervisors . refused to ac
knowledge the validity Of the demand.
The California Â§ municipalities have; now
appointed a committee whose business it
is to- inquire Into ! the entire matter in
behalf.iC-f all the parties concerned. A're
port will be submitted, and, very likely
the municipalities "Will Â¦ be governed In
their attitude by the decision of the com
mittee.. ~ . -â¢â¢â¢Â¦. â¢ Â¦ -

DANDRUFF CAUSED' BY A GEBM .
A . New Discovery That Kills tlio
1 Germ and Prevents Baldness. Â¦
: Pretty nearly all ' the hair preparations
for dandruff ' have some merit in. allaying
Itching of the scalp, and -in being a fairly
Bcod dressing for the hair, but there -is
only one that recognizes . what -causes
dandruff, f alllnr hair and baldness, v and
that I destroys the ; cause, - a little germâ
and that Is ) Newbrd's Herplclde. This
germ eats Its way into the scalp, down to
the hair root, where it saps - that vitality;
causing dandruff as it digs up the scalp
into little white scales. Unless it is de-
stroyed there's no permanent' stopping of
, falling > hair and/ cure : of dandruff '.and
baldness. % Newbro's Herpiclde kills I the
germ. - ."Destroy . the cause, ' you v remove
the effect." \- . ;. ; V'/^M:. '; '- /: ":-\^

CHICAGO, May 3. â At the outset wheat
showed good strength. Cables were firm and
indicated a generally strong foreign position,
especially when the recent sales to France were
considered. There was too much rain In* the
Northwest to permit of early spring wheat
sowing, and the possibility of a retarded spring
crop gave the bulls a higher price argument.
The Government reports still show Kansas and
Nebraska suffering for the want of rain. . On
these influences July wheat opened %@%c to

however. Boon began to arrive telling of rains
In Kansas.; This broke the market for a time.
but the foreign situation br&ught another, rally.
Commission 1 houses were on both'tjldes of the
market and slightly favored buying. The quiet
nature of the market, however, 6llghtly helped
the bears and when Kansas rains were consid
ered -again- they put a selling pressure on the

has been slight Fince the previous week, the
weather having been too cool. The fruit pros
pect is thus far very good. Apples are coming
Into bloom, while plums, pears, peaches and
cherries have been in bloom some time."
"There were but a few slight showers, the
week having been mostly dry and favorable to
fÂ» r<i:r.fr and planting. Oat seeding is in prog
ress In Skaglt County on the flats. Potato
planting is now general. Hope are being trained,

"Althcrugh the weather hag been somewhat
cool, with several frosty nights, the past week
hae been more favorable for growth than any
heretofore this spring. Light frosts on the

Chicago opened strong on bullish cables and
continued unfavorable weather, both In the
Southwest and Northwest. Cash wheat was In
general demand. . Stocks at Duluth decreased
650.000 bushels. - Rains in Kansas caused stop
order selling and" a consequent decline. The
Ohio State report gave a crop condition of 74,
the same as last month. ' Complaints from
Nebraska increased. Reports from Kansas con
tinued gloomy, and were to the effect that even
with rains from now on most of - tbe wheat
counties cannot get more, than seed back. A
large Western exporting house wired that Kan
f-as cannot raise one-third, and Kansas, Texas,
Oklahoma and Nebraska combined not I over
one-half of last year. Continued rains were
reported In the Red River Valley, and through
out the Northwest seeding Is being delayed by
ralnB.
The weekly Chicago letter of Bolton, De Ruy
ter & Co. Bays:
"The market has shown some strength early
on the steady cables, but turned weak early
and sold off later on reports of showers In Kan
sas. There was considerable pit liquidation
of holdings on account of its being Saturday.
Northwcet stocks are weak about 100,000, and
another decline in visible Is expected Monday.
The cash situation remains fairly strong. Any
.weakness in the market at the moment seems
due entirely to weather conditions and \ specu
lative influence. So far as the tendency of re
ports concerning the crop generally is concerned
It is getting no better and there is nothing to
indicate that the Government report on the
10th inst. will not lower its estimate of the
conditions.". Â¦

A deeper Impression than Is superflclaljy ap
parent has been caused by the action this week
of the New York clearing bouse authorities.
The decision to require institutions to be ad
mitted in future to clearing houee privileges to
maintain a cash reserve In their own vaults
commensurate with that required of members
themselves is interpreted as a note of warning
egninst the present rate of rtredit expansion.
This action Is primarily and ostensibly dl
rwrted against the rapid rate of Increase of new
banks and trust companies. It Is also the
ovtgTOWth of much serious discussion that has
taken place regarding tne growth of tbe de
posit banking business and trust companies
without any such legal restrictions upon them
to traintain cash reserves as are enjoined on
the banks. The trust companies retain onlv
an insignificant proi*ortlon of the money in
thÂ«ir own vault* at any time. Their cash is on
deposit with the banks, and figures there as
cash reserve. It is at the very time when de
mand for credits or dimunition of cash in the
bank* has run up the money rat* that thÂ»
trust companies are attracted to put cut loans
at th* hi?Â»j money rate prevailing. Relief Is
nominally afforded to the banks by this shift
ing of the demand for cash on the'trust com
panies, but the effect is likely to be an ex
panding volume of credit on shrinking cash
refcerves. The last published statement of the
condition of trust - companies for New York
State showed loans on'collateral of $540 208 -
20(5. and $121,045,797 of "c*?h . on hand'' of
which, however, all but Â£8.858,702 was on de
posit with banks. There have been heavy
loans since the first of the yoar by the trust
corrpanles. The -weekly bank, statements re
veal that the banks/ are down to near the
legal reserv* limit, which is thus Been to figure
not only against their own deposits, but tnoÂ«"
of the trust companies, and many interior in
stitutions who also keep deposits in New York
Dtcline in speculative Interest has been shown
in the stock market tbls week and efforts at
eupiiOrting prices have not met with entire suc
cess. The month-end requirements precipitated
a stringent condition in the money market,
which was aggravated by the collapse in In
t'.ri.-ational Power and tbe distrust engendered
In some of the other industrials supposed to
have affiliations with that company, or whose
conc"ltien* are erqually. shrouded in mystery.
This undoubtedly led to some discrimination by
the banks agalnn industrial* as collateral in
lr-ans. Tbe ingenious admission by one of the
principals in the power episode that the slump
v.aÂ« due to the .neglect of his patron to put In
a buying order at the same time as his selling
order was impressive as an example 'of liow
some of the recent unexplained advances in
pr!cÂ»s might have been brought about. Tha
most striking fact in the power episode was ths
lack of a general market for the stock, in spite
of its dazzling rise of ever 100 points, when
attempts were made to effect real sales. En
tire eollapse was thÂ«- result. The episode'in
vited attention to the recent course of many
other flocks-. Even nsnong the standard rail
road rtocks there arc instances where the mar
ket turn has over-amounted to several times
the outstanding capital of the company in .the
course of a few days, with a resulting price
change of only a few points. Taken in con
n*ction with complaints of commission houses
of the scarcity of orders .from the general pub
lic, these facts awaken distrust of the genuine
ness of i?om<! of the price movements in the
market. Day after day new high record prices
ar* (-stabllsbed In many standard stocks, to say
nothing of the large crop of new and' untried
industrial securities, of which there is little
public knowledge beyond the recorded price
movements' in tbe market. It is almost an In
variable rule tbat declining money resources
is the instrument for disclosing the weak mar
ket position of securities. Stocks whose high
pilees are due to buying with borrowed re
sources with a view, to only temporary hold
ing must be thrown over when loans begin to
be called in. . . "â¢ .
NEW YORK. May 3.â The net changes In
tc- day's etock market showed little feverUh
nervousness of th^ two hours' trading. When
the market closed yesterday there was little
realizing of the nature of the financial trou
bles reflected in the collapse yesterday of the
&o-ca!led Webb group of stocks on the Stock
Exchange In the curb market. Every oppor
tunity had 'been given to avert the threatened
failures and to provide for support in the stock
market. The fact that no stocks are dcllve:n
ble en Saturday under contracts, according to
Stock Exchange rules and thtt loans made on
Friday carry over to Monday, helped the ef
forts to avoid trouble. There was a threaten
ing break In prices at the opening of the stock
market, in eptte of a strong upward movÂ«m<;nt
in Louisville and Nashville and Pennsylvania.
These advances , were lost. howev*r, % and sup
porting orders at weak points were found, neo
eetary to check indiscriminate liquidation.
V.*hcn St. Paul was- selling in 100-share lot? at
170 there wars bids in the inarktt for 7000
share* at 170%. The centralized buying was
not followed up Then *t was ceen that the sell-
Ing was checked. After the bank statement ap
peared tho buying was renewed in a more ag
grestlve manner, and the market developed a
talrly buoyant tone, with th* close active and
succe. Earlier losses were generally wipÂ«d
out and net Â£alns were quite common at the
close. Of the stocks supposed to b* immediate
ly concerned in the disturbances, Rutland pre
ferred fluctuated between 103 and 99, with the
last sale at 100, compared with 102 last night.
St. Lawrence and Adirondack v/as variously
quoted at 60 bid, 120 asked, and 75 bid and
120 asked, with the closing quotation 50 bid
and 100 asked. The, increase in capital shown
by the banks was a total surprise, us the
bssvy tub-Treasury absorption during the
week indicated a loss of more thnn $3,000,000.
The relief thus afforded was a welcome one. in
view at the loan expansion of more than ?10.
000,000. The sharp liquidation in the stock
market, it Is hoped, has served to relieve the
tmsion of the money situation, although an
actfv* money market is expected next week.

H COAL AND IROK. fj
Si The production of coal and Iron measures S
S3 the growth of modern civilization every- j
EH where. It Is easy to predict the future of \
H 4 conntry rich In the two minerals, which 1
Kj stand for energy and strength. The great |
|1 Northwest has leaped Ioto prominence as j 1
M the home of the precious metals, so called. I
ja The crowds bare passed unnoticed the tlm- I
H bered areas, tbe vast coal measure* and H
1 Iron- di>pofits of Washington and British j I
1 Columbia for the glittering but elusive j
: prizes locked in the Ice and scow ot far- Â£*
' away Nome and the Klondike. j
3 AIMS OF THE COMPANY. Â«
j The wants of this growing conntry are
â¢ the opportunity of the Tacoma Company. *
i Its plans look to nothing leis than meeting %
| ra the Western demand for iron and ateel. 9 i
The total consumption of iron on the 5
j Pacific Coast already amounts to over 3000 S
H tons daily. Let us ask what the demand 1
H will b" nve years hence when the pepa- *
m la t ion is more tban doubled* and tbe com- . S
B merce o* the Pacific ours. At the present i
|i time tbe freight charges on iron from tne 3
H East, the source of all of ocr supplies. Is rj
M $10 to $1S pÂ»r ton. This single item mean* 9
H a clear, additional gain on every ton that jg|
Fl tbe company will manufacture. '
H COAL AND COKE. IRON AND STEEL. M
N The work planned for tbe Taeoma Com- fj
H pany may be stated In a llne:-It will bring E
Bj together at a point on Puget sound already 1
M selected the coal and Iron found abundant- S
S3 ly on Its properties. It will mine coal; but S
JW marketing coal is not tbe end of the cans- &
fej pany's business. Its abundant coal sup- i
H plies will be turned into cuke; but neither a
M Is tfec manufacture and sale of coke tbe I
n end sought. Tat- coke is one step, and only Â§
1-3 one. In the procesa of manufacturing flu- f
tM lahPd iron product*. On the one hand we ',
IB control a balf -dozen great coal fields, rar- i
H tying limitless quantities of the beat cok- jj
HH lnsr coal and located within thirty-live 1
A miles of tide water. And we are la close Â«
B touch with tbe railroad companies, which i
M Insures the lowest transportation rates. 'Â¦
uA Our Iron mines are so fortunately situated I
Eg tbat their products will be carried In
M chutes to tbe bargpÂ« which convey them to 1
fa the company's works. Railroads can never * j
M bleed us . with excessive charges. Our M
M ores and the reduction works are both it
f\ located on tide water, and we shall own ?J
B tbe ahtps which ccnvey the ore to thÂ« 8
Kj place of treatment. Our coal properties, . mt
Sj again, are so near the company's works SI
B thnt n ahort and inexpensive electric line ?i
H will furnish our own transportation from Â£9
N| mine to tide water ahould the necessity S
S] for it arise. Jl
" FINISHED PRODUCTS THE AIM. il
M We have already ore In praetieally limit- y
g less quantltlea. Tbe ore, besides belas ij
9 ef the hishost grade. Is self-contained, so 9
M far as tbe operations of the furnaces are H
fl M>ncprned. .- It contains only traces of 3|
pl'snlphnr and Is free from titanium. By [Â»
H the addition of a small quantity of bema- vj
g| tic. found abundantly npon the holdiu?* Â£|
H of tbe company, this ore is self -fluxing, and >J
H le quality of the iron thus produced is gj
h pronounced by expert authorities equal to *1
ra tbe best Swedish. We shall <!onbtlfÂ»ss 3
Kg sell pig Iron, but this, no more than the J
n tale of coal and coke. Is the goal of th# j
fa great enterprise we are inaugurating. The j |
13 pig lion win go to the markets of the
M Â«rorld in. tbe shape of rails and bars and .
f-i trusses, and all the multifarious forms in .
fca whicb iron Is dpm&nded in modern life. - !
a MAGNITUDE OF THE PLANS. I
Hi The Mining Rrcord for April says: "The 3
M creat scope and importance of the Taeoma '

P the plaus, fast materialixlng. is bewilder- s

"The plans of the company contemplate E3
i tbe erection at Tacoma of coke ovens, blast ,1
I furnaces, rolling mills, a tinnlate factory I
Â£ and other allied industrial plants. With I
'j such objects In view this groat steel and I
s coke company has secured a very advan- *
JS tsgeous site of ,1200 acre*, en deep water, %
J3 near Tacoma. . and on tbe Nothern Pacific 1

to cure 75 per cent with our treatment. Also
a new combined rupture holder and abdom-

read to, the thousands assembled the
cheera could be heard for many blocks.
Queen Tessie was at her best to-night,
and as her crown was fitted to her brow,

â¢The big event was the result of a plan
instituted by State Organizer Temple,
who made the request to the lodges under
his jurisdiction '.that" they .add 300 mem
bers before August 1, 1902,- when the Grand
Camp, will be held at Cripple Creek, Colo.
At '. the rate they- are being secured that
number-will be placed on the rolls of the
California camps. The grand total mem-
S^ h i p ' !l \. this st ate la expected to reach
80,000 hy that; date. The growth of Pro
tection Camp : of Â¦ Stockton has been phe
nomenal from the start. Tracy, Lathrdp.
Oakland, San Francisco, Fresno, Oakdale
and ; other places were Â¦ well : represented,
and every, neighbor, waa given a hospita
ble reception by , the r energetic members
of Protection , Camp. .
Â¦ State Organizer W. I* Temple made an
address in which he recited the wonderful
growth of the order and told of the wofk
yet in hand. .Forest Camp drill team, a
handsomely uniformed organization, gave
an exhibition drill. ; In the big pavilion
nearly 5000 people had gathered to watch
and hear, the exercises. After the public
exercises the Woodmen went to Masonic
Music Hall, i where the initiatory ceremo
nies were ' held. Following this came a
big banquet, which did 'not end at mid
night:-iejÂ«BaaKCBÂ«^?: - Â¦ -- Â¦
bands,: red flre, bombs, -fireworks and
songs made the line of "march" lively. .
The ~ Woodmen ' were given a most en
thusiastic greeting by the throngs which
lined. the streets. . The public exercises at
the pavilion followed the parade. Karl C.
Broeck acted as president and welcomed
the visitors on behalf of the camp, while
Mayor Catts made, the address on behalf
of the city. The famous Boys' Band and
Protection Camp Band tilled in the musi
cal numbers. . - ..-,--=-Â¦ -

The queen was driven to the throne in
a gayly decorated carriage, which was fol
lowed by the vehicles bearing the mem
bers of her court," her prime minister and
others who were on the stage at the time
of the coronation." The carriages were fol

people had assembled. â¢' ' Besides these ; the
sightseers were lined across the street up
