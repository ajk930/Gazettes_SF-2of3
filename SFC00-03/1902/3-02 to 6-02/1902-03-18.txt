After some discussion as to details the
following resolution outlining the plan
proposed to be followed was presented
by the chair and adopted as the sense of
the mfetinsr:
PLAN OF ORGANIZATION.
In view of the fact that the California State
Board of Trade is an organization that for
twelve years has been devoted to the devel
opment of the industries and resource* of this
SUte, end especially to the work of inducing
immltreticn; that it has a large and valuable
exhibit Illustrative of the products , of the
field, garden and orchard. with a â¢ Â¦ fully*
equipped office force of much experience In
the line of immigration and exposition work;
that It has made many investigations relating
to products especially adapted to our soil . and
climate, and has a large fund of Information
, General Chipman discussed the proposi
tion of forming- a central organization at
eome length. Xo movement could be suc
cessful without a governing head. He
suggested the formation of a central body
whi^h should have power to act at Its
discretion in the interests of the counties
represented in the body by appointments
to be hereafter made.
It was Intended to bring the business
men of the, sections alluded to into closer
business relationship for their mutual
benefit. This could only be accomplished
by co-operation on the part of all inter
ested, and the success of the movement
â¢was assured If .the business men inter
ested would put their shoulders to the
wheel and Tielp it along.
Chairman Newhall stated that the pur
pose cf the meeting was to arrange some
plan by which xhe varied business inter
ests of San. Francisco .and the northern
and central counties might be advanced.

"What is it that unites tho Irish na

Ireland wears the cross of thorns and

"Look at tho history of Ireland. For

did not achieve a victoryâ they planted a

The entertainment at the Alhambra in
the evening was somewhat similar to that
given in the_ afternoon, cne main differ
ence being the selections of me musical
programme. The house wa3 crowded
from floor to ceiling.
It was the concluding exercises of a
successful and memorable St. Patrick's
day festival.
Songs of Erin were rendered with feel-
Ing, and choruses dear to the sons and
daughters of Ireland were given with pa
triotic fervor.
The singing of "God Save Ireland" by
the Gaelic Choral Society was one of the
features of the musical part of the pro
gramme, and the vocal solos, "An Irish
Love Song" and "The Banks of tha
Daisies." beautifully rendered by Miss
Annie Rooney, elicited loud applause and
an encore was demanded. "Wearing of
the Green" and "The Harp That Once
Through Tara's Halls" were sriven with
remarkable feeling and expression by the
Gaelic Choral Society. J. C. Hughes sang
"The "West's Asleep" and "My Colleen
Rue" with a tenderness mat aroused tha
sympathies of the vast assemblage.
Professors O'Connor and Kelleher, al
ways welcome performers, once more
danced themselves Into the arood graces of j
every on*, and the overture by the or
chestra. "Memories of Ireland," vividly
brought up romantic recollections of tha
old land.
'â¢The musical programme. Indeed, was
capitally chosen and was in every sense
faultless.
. Resolutions Adopted.
Before the audience dispersed Colonel '
T. Barry presented the following resolu
tions, which were adopted with rousing
cheers: Â¦ .
Whereas. It iÂ» the custom of the Irish so
cieties of San Francisco to hold each year a
Joint celebration of St. Patrick's day, and
Whereas, It is fitting 1 that on such occasion
wo should express our opinion on the great
questions that concern cur, race; now. there
fore, be It
Resolved, first â That we stand by that an
cient and truly national declaration that Ire
land Is of right and ought to bÂ» an (depend
ent nation, with her. own government of her
own people and for her ownbintAt.
. Secondâ That it U thÂ« duty of all Irishmen.
at home and- abroad, to keep thla before their
â¢yÂ«s as thÂ« chief end of thefr striving, and
to remember that experience has shown that
they alono are worthy to be free who are win
ing to fight to obtain and to also maintain
tbelr freedom.
Thirdâ That everything which turns away
the minds of the Irish at home from their
own country Is derlmental . to tha best Inter
ctts of the race and la provocative of the curs*
of emigration under which our motherland la
slowly waiting away.
Â¦ Fourth â That In the revival of the Gaells
tongue and the programme of the Gaelic League
we recogntzn a most efficient Instrument In
keeping th* Irish true to their nationality, and
wt commÂ«nd,thÂ« movement to our brethren in
this country.
Distrust University's' Action.*
â¢ Fifth â That we view with distrust the action
of the Washington Unlvcmlty toward the IrUh

of Hibernian* such action a*, may bÂ« wise
In pmuetlng-thÂ« good name of Dr. tlÂ«nehry
and thÂ« rl*htÂ« of th# donor*, of. the chair, and

Sixth â That wÂ» Mnd go.i(.n.Â«.,t to thÂ«* ioldlÂ«rs

Seventhâ That wÂ« call on the American peoÂ»

â¢ The cowardly murder of these men while !n

A brief resume' of the trial* of James
Brown and his ttnal acquittal,' which arÂ»;
fresh, in the public; mind, forms-,an-lm
portant part of the- communication. The
expenses of the -trial, as Incurred by the
Attorney General's ..office -are given -a3
$3924, for which 'J an appropriation is re
quested. .. The .hostility of. the press of
Modoc -County, meets unfavorable com
ment., It-Is asserted on the -authority of
Judge Harrington and the State's officers
that another; attempt to punlHh the ac
cused men- wpuld. be of. no avail should
the trial be conducted in Modoc County.'
Attorney General' Ford says that a spe
ciaj session of the Legislature would be
warranted, in order that laws'- might -be
enacted -which would Insure a -proper- trial
for the men now In confinement at Altu
ras on the charge >ot 'complicity â¢ In ,th.?
lynching. Two legislative remedies are
suggested. The first .Is to legalize thÂ«
summoning of trial Jurors from adjacent
counties, and the second to make it law
ful for the prosecution to obtain a change
of venue. .The Supreme Court of the
State has held that the Legislature is
without the constitutional authority 'to
make' the latter provision. In view of this
fact the Attorney General -suggests that
the question be submitted to the, people at
the Â¦: next gubernatorial election, and an
extra session of the Legislature would bo
necessary to maker this possible; It' is
said that a special appropriation for | th*
employment of counsel would be neces
sary. , ' .
The Attorney, General says that he feels
that the cases' should not be allowed to
drop, as there is ample- evidence against
the, accused. In closing he says:

Originally It was a- short single 1 line
from St. Louis southwestward. but quiet
ly the Frisco line has grown until to-day
there are more- than 400 miles of railroad
under the management of President Yoa
kum. Through the recent purchase' <Â»f
the Oklahoma City and Western road
the system now reaches to within 3W
miles of Albuquerque. N. Hex. '
"The railroads of the East and Middle
West naturally are turning toward Calj
fornla and to San Francisco as the great
3eaport of the Pacific, through which
must enter the increasing volume of
trade with the Orient." Â¦?... Â¦
"I am not prepared to say' that the
Frisco system will be built to the Paclttc
Coast, but doesn't it stem natural that
a railroad bearing the name that oum
does should have an eye on San Fran
cisco?" said Yoakum to-nigbt. "Our
company was originated with the pur
pose of building to the Pacific. I have
been greatly impressed with conditions
here. It is several years since I was
on the coast, and the changes that have
taken place in that time are wonderful.
From Yuakum's statements and the
quiet activity of the Frisco system, it \&
quite probable the Frisco will be one ot
the fust of the several great railroads
headed westward to reacn the Paclttc
Coast.* 'lhere are engineers now In the
Held, running lines through New Mexico
and Arizona, and they will soon be in
California, finding a route for an entirely
new transcontinental railroad. .
LOS ANGELES, March lT.-Presldent
B. F. Ycakum of the dt. Louis and San
Francisco Railroad Company, commonly
called the Frisco, is on the Padflc Coast,
to make personal observation of Indus
trial conditions here, the result of his In
vestigations to determine whether his
railroad will be extended to the Pacltlo
Coast. Yoakum has spent several days
In the southern part of the State, and will
leave Los Angeles for San Francisco to
morrow.. there to look into the chanced
of obtaining terminals, for the plan is to
build to Sait Francisco.

FILES CHARGES AGAINST
THE CHICAGO POSTMASTER
BILL 10 PROMOTE THE AMERICAN MERCHANT MARINE IS PASSED
cause proper regulations to be framed for
the execution of this act.
When the ship subsidy bill was taken
up Gallinger of New Hampshire
spoke In favor of It. He said he was not
troubled about the constitutionality of
the proposed law or the charge that the
subsidy is a gift to pri\'ate interests.
"If it shall prove to be a gift," said he,
"It will be no worse tnan other legisla
tion that has had the support of some
Senators who seem to be greatly dis
crrsfed'over the pending measure." He
t hen referred to the large annual appro
priations paid Southern railroads for fast
mail, and the river and harbor appropri
ations. ' .
"The capacious and rapacious maw of
the Mississippi River will be opened,",
paid he, "and will take in millions of pub
lic money."
Pattprson of Colorado discussed briefly
his proposed amendment to prevent the
employment of Chinese seamen on sub
sidized \'esscls. He said me amendment
had the approval of the American Fed
oration of I^abor and the International
Seamen's Union. American labor has
been driven from employment on the
fhips on the Pacific Coast by Chinese
labor.
LOSS TO AMERICANS.
Money of Mississippi said It had been
â¢ '.:Â¦. im*-d that the American people were
losing J36O.O00.fKiO a year because that
amount annually was paid to foreign bot
toms for carrying our commerce. AÂ» a
fact the United States has lost nothing,
as it simply paid a reasonable rate for
services rendered. . .
Vest spoke in favor of his free ships
amendment and in support of the propo
sition to apply the anti-trust law to ship
owners who enter Into a conspiracy in
restraint of trade.
Frye declared that ten years ago Eng
land carried 63 per cent of the ocean trade
of the world, while now England carried
nnly 53 per cent of that trade. Great Brit
ain, he said, was losing the world's car
rying trade.
In response to some of the arguments
advanced Hanna spoke briefly. He in-
Fisted that it was a loss to the American
people to pay $150,000,000 or J200.OO0.O00 for
the carrying cf our foreign commerce, for
under Just laws perhaps 50 per cent of
that amount would remain In the hands
of Americans. The American merchant
marine had gone down and down until it
out a sorry figure among the nations of
the world.
In the course cf a reply to a statement
made by Hanna Clay of Georgia declared
that one per cent per gross ton was all
that was necessary to equalize the differ
ence between the cost of construction and
operation cf . American shipstand the cost
of construction and operation of foreign
vessels, yetthe bill provided for a subsidy
of uearly three cents per gross. ton. -
Wellington - favored the pending meas-;
ure, because he believed It 'would go far
toward building up Jhe American mer-'
chant marine. He thought it "good econ
omy to. build up. American manufactures
and'to encourage the upbuilding of Ameri-,
can shipping.- He, paid a high tribute* to
Frye for his- advocacy of the rehabilita
tion of the'Amerlcan merchant marine.' '.\
CKITICISMS. BY PERKINS.
Perkins of California criticized tbe'state*:
ment of Ciay *1d*reTere"nee to ;.tho * ,fi*ar
ships of the American line and saiÂ«l. that
last year they carried^from-New-York to
ports in England $20,000,000 In- value. -of
farm products. Â¦ â¢ r ;;â¢';â¢.'"
Mcl^aurin of Mississippi made a few re
marks against the bill and Scott of West
Virginia spoke in favor of it because, he
said, it was a protective measure. â¢
Frye closed the debate. He was neither
physically nor mentally able to make a
speech.- he said. â¢
"In trying to avoid the Charybdis of
smallpox," said he. "I ran into the Scyila
of vaccination, and which is the more
painful I am unable. to determine."
By way of explanation of certain fea
tures of the bill, which he eald did not
seem to be understood, he stated that the
ordinary freight 6hip which is to receive
the subsidy is divested of all the excessive
requirements of the postal subsidy ships.
Referring to the proposition to prevent
Chinese eailors on ships, he said it would
destroy the line on the Pacific. He was
opposed to .the proposition because our
sailors are unable long to stand the'ex
cessive heat of the engines and fire
rooms.- He warned Senators favoring the
bill to look out for amendments to the
bill offered by members of the opposition.
With much deliberation, and addressing
himself to the Republican side of ' the
chamber, Frye call on them to "beware
of the Greeks when they are bringing
gifts." "-.Â¦.Â¦Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦
Teller interrupted to ask if Fryc would
tell what he thought of the amendments
offered by Republican Senators. . â¢
"Lest I would not have time. I will at
tend to that now." answered Frye, amid
much laughter. He then entered upon a
detailed analysis of the amendments
which had been offered, some of which he
had no objection to. while others he hoped
would be withdrawn.
In his closing- remarks Frye said he
would accept the amendments offered by
Allison, limiting the time of the operation
of the measure, because he believed, they
were In the interest of the bill.
VOTES WITH REPUBLICANS.
At 3 o'clock when Frye had concluded.
Vest of Missouri offered his amendment,

The meeting wa3' attended -by fifty-two
Republican members. 'â¢ ', A resolution : had
been framed by Representative Tawney
and this served 'as the basis of action.
The dlscusnion was all -.opposed to an
agreement which would reduce the ' tariff
even temporarily. It was Jlnally agreed,
however, to give this understarfdlrig . an
afllrmatlve aspect, namely, that any plan
for concession to Cuba would be accepta
ble if it did not involve a reduction of- the
tariff. Those who attended' the confer
ence said, the natural effectof this -was
to accept nothfher that involved a reduc
tion of the tariff. ;,- Others characterized
the understanding reached as a determin
ation to "stand -pat." Â¦

only American horse in the. Lincolnshire
handicap is' â¢ Foxhall' Keen^'s Olympian

expectd to be a. duel between R.,3. Sle

Singer's O'Donoyari Rossa (Hve-year-old).
It was rumored to-day that-should'Scep
tre win that horse will becojne;the prop
erty, of either W. C, Whitney or. Foxhall
Koene, the price named being somewhere
in thfr neighborhood of $30,000. - - ' .
The fact that Tod Sloan, had been rid
ing Sir Ewaldie- Griffiths'' Veles (four
year- old) in training gallops-led to the
rumor that the American Jockey would
ride him in to-morrow's handicap, ,-Mmt
Sloan thus far only has been. granted a
license to train and- ride in gallops." . .

â¢Touted far and wide as the 'sweetest
morsel on the -menu, Jim Halo had his
colors lowered by Herculean In the mile
and a sixteenth selling affair. Impromptu
opened favorite, but there developed such
a- brisk play on Jim Hale that his odds
dropped from 2 down to 4 -to 5. In' pre
vious races the last named gelding has
always shown to better advantage when
ridden out in thÂ» lead. Lee Jackson man â¢
aged to pick a rail position behind Com-'
mlssloner Forster' and Herculean with
Jim, not; being able to strike clear, sailing
until rounding .the bend, for .home. -Then
in a long drive Herculean, under Conley's
hard urging, downed the favorite a head.
Gawaine, a 60 to 1 shot, took the show.
Outclassing his field shoes to plates, the
brown â¢ horse Sweet Tooth made short
work of his company in the closing three
quarter sprint. Heavily played at 4 to 5,
Birkenruth, waited with' him. '.to the
stretch, then breezing in an easy first in
1:14*4. School for Scandal lasted. longer
than Kitty Kelly, taking the place by a
length. v
Brack Dick, - from the Bell stable, en-
Joyed a gallop In the mile and a furlong
run. With Â¦-. John McGurk and El Mldo
looking the hardest propositions to down,
the books laid 8 to 5 against the Eastern
horse. Birkenruth had only to sit still in
the saddle until the stretch was reached
and then make his move. - John McGurk
took, the place in a. hard, drive from El
Mido, Johnny Hoar possibly making his
move. too soon with the latter.-, .v
Nearly everybody expected Lady Ster
ling to improve on her previous race, but
the mare ran unplaced in the opening
seven-furlong run.- She ruled a 4 to i
chance in the ring, and after leading
down the backstretch for a way fell back.
Huachuca, the second choice, well ridden
by L. Paly, earned the verdict in a hard
drive from The Weaver, a 10 to 1 shot. '.
Three out' of the six starters in the
Sarsfleld hurdle handicap finished. Duke
of York, carrying 155 pounds and well rid
den by Mattier.won easily at the finish
from Bonitary. The winner closed an
even money chance. Master, Lee took a
header at the first jump, and- Aurlf era
came to grief at the second obstacle. Sam
Green, the heavily played second '.' choice,
was left. . . /....Â¦â¢
in evidence. Shamrocks were
conspicuous, fastened In the, head stalls
of many of the horses,', and the mounts of
riders sporting green" colors [were backed
"off the board by the more superstitlously
inclined. The' horses of L. V. : Bell carried
off all the honors, Black Dick," Herculean
and Sweet Tooth capturing the last thres
races on the programme. , As but two
favorites ? were bowled 'over speculators

well ; to j form,' and altogether it was one
"of r the : most enjoyable - day's sport ' since
the opening of the season.
In Â¦ the two-year-old ; event, a half-mile
dash, W. L. Stanfleld's colt Bell Reed was
put to the crucial test, and the flying
youngster acquitted himself admirably.
Carrying 118 pounds and perfectly ridden
by Nash Turner, he outsprinted and out
stayed his field, winning almost easily at
the wire, two lengths in front of Walter
Jennings' big colt Arabo. The winner ran
the distance in 49 seconds, which is fast,

San Bernardino Daily Sun:. . ' :
Governor Henry Tv Gage Is a candidate for.
ienotr.lna.tion at the hands of the. Republican
State convention, which will meet next ' fall.
Hla candidacy was formally announced In yes
terday's Herald, and In an Interview the Gov
ernor, gives some of the reasons why he-de
sires to have the honor of a . second nomina
tion by the Republicans of California, " and
also some of the grounds upon which he bases
the hope that that honor. wÂ«ll be his. ',.
So far as his argument appealing to . the
voters of the State is concerned, there is some
merit In what Mr. Gage says. : His adminis
tration has. been free from scandal, and it has
been as economical as those that have gone
before. .But when the Governor touched rpon
party matters he certainly l grabbed thÂ» hot
end of the poker, and if his- fingers are not
singed before he lets go, he has discovered
a. new. brand of . political asbestos, wo\-en in
his own shop. Â¦ â¢. â¢ .
He has discovered; that" there is. some, op
position to his renomlnatlon on the part of
Republicans who think. they .have, a party, rea
scn for their position. These he terms news
paper, 'bosses and disappointed politicians. And
then he makes, this most remarkable, state
ment: . .'
â¢ .In 1S0S. there went up a loud cry from
some of the self -same forces ; at present ."
against me. calling for. a Senator
r "ana '''Â¦not*' a Governor from the south â met 1
"then, by my assertion that both a Sena
tor and a Governor could come from the
south, which has become ' a demonstrated
fÂ«.ct. â¢ . \
Now, wouldn't that JAR you?. ---.â¢, â¢
Wouldn't that. sink your bobber and wrinkle
your raglan? â¢ Tell it not Â¦ In Gath and pub
lish It not In Askalon. but the Governor four
long years ago foretold ' the- election of a Sen
ator from the south. "Wire the news to. the
Senator at the Capitol at Washington, and
tell him that the Governor knew it long be
fore and was v.}aA. - .
If Governor Gace expects to make his cam
paign for renomlnatlon on the strength of
what he did to assist in the election of a
Southern California /Senator, it might.be well
for him to begin ' at once to \ prepare I to re
turn;to'Los Angeles about next New Tear's
day. . or as soon thereafter as the law. of the j
State provides for the Inauguration of his sue- j
c-esaor. There \ may be places in the south
land where that sort of argument will carry
the' primary. - but it won't go In San Berdoo <
â not by a considerable. j ' Â¦
Â¦ This was one of the first "counties in the
south into which Mr. Gage brought the light
of his countenance, almost four years \ ago,
when he developed an ambition to be the chief
executive of California. . He met here not
an .indefinite but- a well crystallized sent!- Â¦
ment In favor of .the' Republicans of the south
asking for a United States. Senator to sue-"
ceed . Stephen M. White, and . permitting the
gubernatorial nomination to go to * the north.
And he at once set about to answer the ar
gument that he had produced Â¦ that sentiment.
'Sitting - in- the old Sun office, on the oppo
site side-: of Court street, one evening; ' along
with Judge F. F. Oeter and the ': writer. Mr.
Gage made this- statement :- "Why, if I ihould
be. nominated .and elected Â¦ Governor Â¦ it might
be worth twenty or. twenty-five, -.votes to., a
Southern California candidate for. Senator.".
" To Â¦ several other well-known ' people . in -' Re
publican poIUIcs.Jln -this -city., he urged .that
h{s candidacy would . in no -wisa Interfere with
the Interests of a southern candidate for Sen
ator. . but, on the contrary, ' would strengthen
the chances of such a candidate. ' .
â¢ San Bernardino was interested in the elec
tion of a Senator, and was particularly inter
ested-in'the success of U. S. Grant of San
f Diego, but -we listened' to ' the song' of the
siren, and' our- delegation 1 went over. Te
hachapl with the rest of Southern California,
whooping for Henry T. Gage for Governor
and a southern man for Senator, - and we
helped to. make it unanimous for Gage.
And what did the Governor do? How about
.his statement and implied promise that if he
; were Governor his Influence might be worth
' twe'nty/or twenty-five, votes for a- southern
f man for Senator? He was Governor, - and he
'had the- influence and perhaps the j twenty or
â¢twenty-five votes,' but they did not go to". help
' Grant; nor were they were found In Bulla's
camp; nor yet were they cast for Bard, or
'any other* man who Â¦ hailed from the south
land, but they went for Colonel Dan Burns,
from start to finish, repudiating every prom
ise held out to the people of the south who
' had helped him to the executive chair.
But that was not all." Place the Governor's
present statement, "that both a Senator and
a Governor could come from the south, which
has become a demonstrated- fact," alongside
that other statement made by him to a re
porter for . the â¢ San Francisco Examiner, In
Sacramento, while the deadlock was In prog
ress. - that - If- hlB signature- to a commission
would do Colonel Burns any good, he could
have it.- and then let him" say whether the fact
-that Senator Bard now shares, the honor of
speaking for California on the floor of the
Senate Is because of anything Mr. Gage did,
or In spite of all he could do.
. The Sun has no criticism of Governor Gage's
udmlnlBtratlon. Let that take. care of Itself
But if he thinks to bamboozle anybody in
these parts / into believing that we do not
know when we are . Jobbed, he will have to
arise Bllghtly earlier In the a. m.
Tulare Dally Register:
The partisans and apologists for Henry T
Gage are affirming with much satisfaction ihat
the opposition to Â¦ his renomihation for -Gov
ernor is purely political in character, th*t the
objection goes solely to political method* em
ployed. This is not quite true, aÂ£ -will be dis
covered when the campaign is on, if it ~omes
on with Mr. Gage as standard-bearer,/' but
may not objection to political methods be a
: valid objection? Is it thoroughly unimportant
to the State and to public policy, what- sort
of political"- methods are employed in the man
agement of a: great political â¢ party?
What is the status of .the Gage combination
to-day? On. what does that combination base
Its hopes' of controlling the next Republican
State. Convention?' On a coalition of the po
litical department of the Southern : Paclflo
Â¦Company, ths Burns push south of ' Market
street In San Francisco Â¦ (and the same sort
of Â¦ an element . in Sacramento and -. tos An
geles), reinforced by that portion of the Cath
olic' hierarchy -'headed by Father Peter C
Torke. .' . Â¦Â¦. â
There Is, a, combination not to be despised
in a convention, but does It represent the in
telligence, the political convictions, the civil
conscience and the higher interests of 'Â¦* the
Republican, party- of California? If. that com
bination does not so represent the consensus

The administration forces understand well

And they have been figuring for some time to
devise Â¦ ways and Â¦ means to get a Gage organ

to "buy a paper in Pomona- and make a Gage

Bed Bluff Sentinel:
Gage went Into office with the strongest
promises of being independent and free from
corrupting influences, but he betrayed his high
position into the hands of the bosses and
brought into contempt his official station'- by
using appointments as a club In attempting to
force upon the. people of Calif ornia a â¢ candi
date for United States Senator who was utterly
repugnant to a large percentage' of our citi
zens. Â¦ Â¦ . Â¦ ......
. Another, shocking example of. his surrender
to the corrupt political bosses was the appoint
ment of that noxious â¢ boss, Johnnie McKenzte
of San Jose, as a trustee of the Home for the
Feeble-Minded at Glen Ellen and the dismissal
of Dr. Osborn, who was at the head of .that
institution. Dr. Osborn has a clean and hon
orable record, having made a special study of
the affUcted ones In his charge, and the one
act of Governor Gage's administration in dis
missing him without cause or, reason should
defeat Gage for the Republican nomination.
A vast, number of Republicans who say little
and never take an active part In politics are
bitterly opposed to Gage and will consider it a
pleasure to vote for his opponent if he should
be nominated. ._ His nomination will â¢ mean de
feat, and. if the Republicans of California are
wise Henry T. Gage- will not be their standard
bearer. -The day of corrupt political bosslsin

is prepared to take this action. Powderly

Wachtfr of Maryland', rising" to a ques
tion 4it personal privilege, had read a
newspaper article, charging that the
Speaker had attempted to coerce his ac
tion on the question of Cuban reciprocity
by threatening to defeat an item on the
river and harbor bill, la which he was
reported as interested. Wachter de
nounced the story as an unqualified false
hood.
Richardson of Tennessee made the point
of order that the question presented was
not one involving personal privilege, but
the Speaker overruled the point of order,
holding that the matter presented was an
attack on a member In his representative
capacity.
"I consider It not only an attack," re
sumed Wachter, "but a cowardly at
tack."
Proceeding, he denied in the most em
phatic terms that the Speaker had at
tempted to Influence him in any way and
said that-.-the river and harbor project re
ferred to in the newspaper- was not In
his district and he had no personal inter
est 5n It. - ' . .
Are Being' Decreased.
Burton said that the appropriations for
river and harbor work, instead of In
creasing with other governmental ex
penditures as was popularly supposed,
were in reality decreasing. Burton also
denounced the popular idea that unworthy
projects for the improvement of bays and
creeks absorbed a proportion of the ap
propriations in the bill. The appropri
ations were not divided up according to
Spates and localities. The great projects
In "which the whole country was inter
ested absorbed J50.000.OCiO. with $00,000,000
carried and authorized by the bill.
Burton then entered into the details of
the bill. One of the important new feat
ures of the bill, he said, was a provision
for a board of five engineers, familiar
with all river and harbor Work, to pass
on surveys, examinations and estimates.
Bellamy of North Carolina criticized the
bill tor what he declared was the unjust
treatment accorded North Carolina. The
States represented on the River and Har
bor Committee, he said, received $47,000,
000 of the $60,000,000 carried by the bill.
WASHINGTON. D. C. March 17.â The
House to-day began consideration of the
river and harbor bill. Burton of Ohio,
who is In charge of the measure, in his
opening statement said he would . not
discuss the benefits . to commerce ; and
trade from, the appropriations contained
In the bill, but would confine himself at
some length to discussing some popular
misapprehensions with reference to It.'
In the first place, he said, the impression
existed that the bill carried something
over JOO.000,000 for the ensuing fiscal year,
whereas It carried but" 524,030,000 of actual
appropriations, the "remaining ?3C,000,000
being simply authorized to be appropri
ated under the contract system. There
was also, he said, a mistaken idea that
the pending measure carried larger ap
propriations than any previous bill. In
1S90, he said, the actual appropriations in
the bill exceeded 525.000,000. For the cur
rent year the appropriations contained in
the sundry bill, to provide for continuing
contracts authorized in river and harbor
bills, were $37,000,000, against J1LOO0.OO0 for
the two previous years.

decided to again take ub the reci

There h&s long been, con
'tentlon on the part dt the members of
the House that because these treaties
affect the tariff system they be
p&s-scd upon by the House as well as ,by
the Senate. The/Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations was not- disposed to
concede this point, but because the Ding
ley bill .authorizing these commercial
agreements contained a provision ' re
quiring the consent of â¢ the ; entire Con
gress the committee has now taken a
position favorable to the House conten
tion by adopting the . report prepared â¢ by

Spooner is chairman. It is '.understood
that the next step will be In this direc
tion, and it is probable the question will
be taken up at the next regular meeting
to be held on Wednesday of this , week.
Senator Aldrlch. who has contended that
the treaties should be considered in,^the
light of tariff legislation, will be invited
to appear before the committee, and give
his views on the subject. If the amend
ment is Â«Ciade to one of the treaties it will
be made to all of them- and to all agree
ments of the kind which may in the lu
ture be entered. Into under. the provisions
of the Dingley act. The members of the
Committee on Foreign Relations are out
speken in their declaration that this con
cession does not in any way affect the
treaty-making power of the President and
the Senate, which, they contend, is exclu
sive of the House, but a majority .of the
members say that as they voted for the
Dingley bill, which contains the reciproc
ity clause, consistency on their part re
quires that they should insert this
clause. They also say that their inser

G- OVERNOR r GAGE has lost the. confidefnee^f the, people. It is the common impression in
the minds of Republicans throughout the State that he cannot be re-elected. He has thrown
to the winds all i semblance . of \ respect for the position -that he occupies. . He has so abso
lutely surrendered the administration of State /affairs to Herrih and Burns that he cannot make an
appointment to the Board of State Harbor Commissioners or to/a district - agricultural ..society
without asking the advice and consent of the bosses. The dieers of the people for a good man
for United States Senator were "ringing : in his ears when .'; he went over to the railroad yards
and joined the. aljled bosses in; a campaign to force the election of Dl M.. Burns to the United
States Senate. Gage's neighbors in the south avefthat he did not keep faith with them.^He has
certainly proved faithless : to the stahyart Republicans; of the north, who gave him .such splendid
majorities in th<e campaign of 1898. But what tells most against him in the minds.of Californians
is his humiliating surrender of the high prerogatives of Governor to a brace of common political
bosses. The citizens of California are ashamed; of Gage, and his associates. .Newspapers other

She cannot will away any part of tha

California the surviving husband, upon
the- death of the wife, takes all the prop

the husband has the absolute* power to
dispose of the community property tha

They are not sure of- him, however, and will try him
outby running him for Governor this fall should he
be found willing to, take chances.. Should he win he
will have a big boom for the Presidential nomination
in 1004, but should he v fail he will be lost in the
shuffle and will never be. a trump card again so long
as the present players are at the political table. His
friends say he is a very able man, but his only notable
attractiveness for campaign purposes-is that he is a
gold man, but took no part against Bryan, either in
1896 or 1900. Whether the Bryanites will regard that
as. an atonemenffor his objection to free silver re
mains to be seen. In the meantime the Judge loo.ms
above' the political horizon and casts a shadow that
looks portentous. Perhaps he is going. to be "It."
Blind Spot of the Eye.

said nothing about the blind spot, which
is where the- optic nerve comes through

suppose my readers would go to the box
office and demand their money back, says

not print a cross-mark here and dot over

that the dot will disappe^f-. I could make

arms. Shut your, left eye and look fixedly
with your right eye at your left thumb.
Separate your hands, and when they are
about six inches apart the right thumb
will go. out of business temporarily, for
its picture will fall upon the blind spot.
Now,' here's the curious part of it. Though
men have tried all sorts of experiments
on themselves for unknown'thousands of
years, this phenomenon was not discov
ered until the time of Charles II of Eng

Makng of Pap Â»r Money.

There can hardly be a doubt that the' movement
will be highly beneficial not only to the South but to
the nation as a whole. In fact, the advancement . of ;
Southern. education is just now something like a na
tional necessity. The young men and women of that ;
section have nothing â¢ like the educational \ advantages'
of those < of the North, and of course' the great ',. ma- 1
jority of them cannot afford to leave their, homes arid*:
go North to attend colleges of; technical J institutions.';'
A little generous help will, be an encouragement to
self-help. The manufacturing Â¦ enterprises 'in ; the
South are flourishing, and it is onlyV a- question .of <
, .It is announced that while the board seeks incor
poration with large and liberal powers it will work
through existing channels, and on business princi
ples, aiding institutions already established instead
of seeking to found new ones. It will .do -its work
without discrimination of race, sex or creed.; The
directors, have had large experience, in educational
matters, and some of them have also had experience
in the distribution of the Peabody and Slater funds,
so that the work begins under the supervision of men
having a wide and accurate "knowledge of the
problems with which they will have to deal.
The association is to be known as "The General
Educational Board.". William H. Baldwin Jr., pres
ident of the Long- Island Railroad/ is chairman. Dr.
.Wallace Buttrick of Albany has been chosen- secre
tary of the board and will receive a salary ample
enough to justify him in giving. all his time and ener
gies to the work of the board. Among the direct
ors are President. Gilman of the Carnegie Institute
at Washington; Dr. J. L. M.. Curry, .who. for many
years was agent of the Peabody educational fund,
and Morris K. Jessup, president of the Slater educa
tional fund, . ; ./;' ' ij) Â¦:Â¦,-.< " : , : -;.- ; .
SOME time ago The Call directed attention to
the beginning of a movement in" New York to
organize an association to promote education
throughout the Union wherever private liberality is
needed to help out the work of the States. The aim
of the promoters of the enterprise is primarily that of
helping the Southern States, whose universities and
colleges have received no share in that large flow of
contributions from the rich men and women of the
country that has done so much to advance the great
colleges of the North. It is gratifying to announce
that so cordially have philanthropic men united in
the movement that an association for the purpose
has been already organized, above $1000 subscribed
and steps taken to effect incorporation. .%

that State will nominate him for. Governor and let
him make the fight' of his life to see if he is still

HOW completely trade is separated from sen
timent is shown by the recent publication of
treasury statistics relating to our trade j with
Spain. Since the war in which we stripped the Span
ish of almost the whole of their colonial empire their
feeling toward us can hardly be one of great friend
liness, and yet we have been able to offer them such
good terms for both imports and exports that their
commerce with us has actually increased. The dip
lomatic officials of other nations have of late vied
with one another, in declaring, the friendliness of
their Governments for the United States during the
Spanish war, and yet, if we may judge by trade
statistics, our real friend is Spain herself.
The figures of the Treasury Bureau of Statistics
show that both the imports into the United States
from Spain and exports from the United States to
Spain were, with a single exception, greater in the
calendar year 1901 than in any preceding year. .Our
imports from Spain during the year ending with De
cember, 1901, amounted to $7,040,758, and bur ex
ports to Spain were $16,785,7^1. Comparing 1901
with 1891, it is shown that our imports from Spain
have grown from $4,906,475 to $7,040,758, and that
exports to. Spain from , the United States have in
creased from $12,887,477 to $16,785,711. Comparing
present conditions with those of 1898, it appears that
cur imports from Spain have increased from $3,608,
508 in 1898 to the above mentioned figure, $7,040,758,
and our exports to Spain from $8,050,475 in 1898 to
$16,785,7". : ' : j' : M.
It is noted by the treasury officials that the growth
of our trade with Spain is the . more interesting .be
cause our exports to many otheT European countries
show a decline. Thus it appears that in the calendar
year 1 901 our exports to Austria-Hungary, France,
Germany, Greece, , Italy, Portugal, Russia, Sweden
and Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom
show a decrease as compared with 1900; while to
Spain they show an increase from .$15,2^917 to
$16,785,711. On the import side our imports from
Austria-Hungary, Germany, ; Russia, Sweden and
Norway and Switzerland show a decrease, while
those from Spain have increased from $5,382,662 in
1900 to $7/040,758 in 1901. " '
Our exports to the Spanish consist mainly of ar-'
tides used in manufacturing, such as cotton, lum-.
ber and crude mineral oil. We also export to them a
good deal of tobacco. From them we import mainly,
fruits, wines, nuts, oil, chemicals, cork and a certain
grade of iron ore not readily produced in the United
States, Cali'fornians will note with interest that our
imports of oranges, lemons and raisins are not nearly
so large as they were some years ago, as California
producers are now. supplying a large part of the home
demand. Another statement of the. report, however
is not so gratifying. It appears that our imports of
preserved fruits from Spain have Â¦ increased." This
. shows that while we are content to get such profits
as result from producing green \ fruit or dried ; fruit,
the Spaniards are deriving in our markets the larger
profits which flow from the manufacture of finer pre
serves. The time ought not to be far distant; when
California will supply the East with that â¢ kind of
goods also. Â¦ Wi\

MISS UVINZA C. COLES of Kingston, Pa., is making a good living and
rapidly acquiring wealth as a prophetess, . says the North American.
Miss Coles makes luck charts, draws horoscopes, tells when to plant
and .*- transplant, when to, fish, when to make business speculations, and,
in short, when to do most things successfully, even Including picking- a girl or
man best suited to one's inclinations and getting married.
Besides this 1 , she issuÂ«s each month a little magazine called "Storms and
Signs," which contains much Information, and, to those who have faith in itâ
and they are not fewâ it is very interesting. A number of farmers take it and
are governed by its directions.
Miss Coles claims no great gifts of second sight or anything of that sort,
but she knows astronomy thoroughly, and she says she bases most of her pre
dictions on the planetary' Influence upon human and vegetable life. She says
that her father invented an instrument called the electric eye, by which things
hitherto hidden are revealed. It is supposed to be so powerful a microscope
and telescope that by its aid one is enabled to make discoveries which have>
a powerful . effect upon all conditions of life.
She. writes all the matter for her magazine herself, and in a little column
under the head of "What Our Thoughts. Say" she makes some happy observa
tions. Here are a few of the latest:. Â£

While there can be no question of the general loy
alty of the. colonies to the crown and the existence
of a-feeling of pride in being part of so great and
widespread , an 'empire, it is by no means probable
that even the most imperialistic of the colonies will
undertake much in the; way of contributing to ' im
perial defense. Sir Wilfrid Laurier, speaking for
the Canadian -Government, has' already declared a
doubt as to the possibility of devising a plan for
joint imperial defense. "In reply to the call for the
conference he says that he and his colleagues "do
not anticipate that in the varying conditions of the
colonies there can be any scheme of defense applic
able to all." .That seems to settle the question so far
as Canadian contributions to .imperial taxation is con
cerned. Canada, prefers to look out for herself. The
mother country must do the same. .
Questions of that -kind carry their answers with
them. Moreover, they are highly significant. If no
one foresaw two years ago what the war would cost,
nor how long it would continue, so also no one can
now foresee how much longer it' will go on nor how
much more it will cost. Clearly then it is the part of
wise 'statesmen to interest the colonies in the empire
if they can and to bring them to the relief of the
mother country and its heavily burdened taxpayers.
.The feeling of* the average British, taxpayer upon
the situation in, South. Africa was well expressed by
the chairman of the meeting of the stockholders of.
Lloyd's Bank in London a! short time ago, in saying:
"Who ' would . ! have thought when . they met in
xooo, when the country was just emerging from the
critical stages of the war, and fancied they saw the
end approaching, that two years thence it would, still.,
be dragging on? Who would have that
*:qnsols,\which stood at g& l A, a drop of i$*ir'6m what
they stood at exactly, twelve months^ previouslyr-^.
they, had even been higher than thatâ could possibly
fall to 91, the point at which they stood in November
last? Or who would have thought the cost of the
war would amount, as it assuredly , would, to one
third as much again as the whole sum of Â£153,000,000,
which was paid off the national debt during the
sixty-three years of her late Majesty's reign?".
Under ordinary .conditions the political and com
mercial relations of: the colonies to one another and
to the empire would engage a great.' deal of attention,
for they involve \ difficult r problems and matters of
vast importance, but at the present. time they are
overshadowed by, the' question of imperial defense.
The war in South Africa has put a severer strain upon
the military strength of the. British 'Islands than was
ever dreamed. of.' It has'also brought' to light the fact
that -Great ; Britain has few -friends among , the na
tions'and that- commercial rivals in Germany, are
eager to profit by any disaster '.that may befall her.
It seems evident, that some system of conscription
will have to be. adopted to keep the army up to the
needs; of the empire, and- that, of course, will entail
a permanently heavy" burden, upon the taxpayers.
Hence the ' eagerness, not of the Government only,
but of the whole kingdom, to get the colonies to bear
a share of the cost. ';'. Â¦Â¦Â¦"..Â¦ .
In his letter inviting the .colonial Premiers" to the
conference Mr. Chamberlain, Secretary of State, for
the colonies, is. reported to have stated .that ; his Maj
esty's Government is prepared to -consider questions
of the political relations of the 1 various parts of the
empire, commercial -arrangements, imperial defense
and other matters of common interest. The colonial
Governments were further invited to suggest any
other subjects which they might deem it advisable to
consider during the conference, and they were es
pecially requested to submit definite proposals or
resolutions upon any point they deemed it advisable
the conference should deal with.
PREMIERS of the various British "colonies have
Â¦been invited to attend a conference with rep
resentatives of the imperial" ' Government at
London, and the approaching meeting is now re
ceiving a good deal of attention throughout the em
pire/ The aim of the British Ministry, is of course to
bring about a closer relation between the colonies
and the mother country, qnd if possible to induce the
colonial Governments to Bear, a share of the burden

BUT ONE TRIAL-W. H. K-. Napa, CaL
There was but one trial of Theodore Dur
rant for murder. _._.,...
This government is made to control, to punish, to
restrain, to police, but not to go among men and take
from them the operation of business and the field
which their discovery and invention have enriched
with all that makes the modern world greater than
all the ages that preceded it.
In the line of discovery and invention the ultima
thule is still below the horizon. It is far away. The
curvature of time, the perspective of the age to come,
hide it from our vision. .It loses parallax. We can
not triangulate its distance. But if all that man has
done in approximating that ultimate is now ,tb go
into the. hands of government, his approach to the
finality of progress will cease. Government has,
never even invented the weapons with which it makes
men slay each other. It is a Juggernaut, demanding
that "'victims'- be crushed, but it cannot make the
chariot whose wheels grind bodies into pulp
and mix them with the dust.
Altgeld's school persists in treating government as
a physical and psychical entity, with emotions, im
pulses, manners and morals. The fact is that govern
ment has no brains, no morals, no honor, no man
ners, no no invention, no discovery. It is a*
civic mechanism, an automaton, as unconscious of its
own action as was the automaton of Maelzell of the
moves it made at chess. This sightless, hearless and
unfeeling entity, without moral emotion" or. purpose,
a mechanism to enforce order among men, as uncon
scious of its function as the jail in which- thejr ex
cesses are restrained, is presented by the Altgeld
school as a thing of blood and marrow, fleshed and
featured, capable of doing business and a universal
parent for' the human race. Viewed in its 'right as
pect government is to govern, because it is a blank,
unfeeling -to pity, insensible to honor, knowing no
friend, xio enemy*, and it is this government that is
now to take over a century's harvest sown by the
brains of man! '.
It needs but little thought to demonstrate that if
the last century had begun with that government
ownership with which the Altgeld school desires that
should begin the list of inventions and discoveries
and their beneficent results would been
abridged. Where during that century did govern
ment invent or discover in the lines .of activity over
.which it had control? In the appearance -of all
those things to which man owes his advancement,
the economies of life, the ease and cheapness of his
intercourse and traffic, the increase in his wages' and
profits, his debt is due to man, not to government.
From this he proceeded to argue that now gov
ernment should own and operate all of these â¢Â¦Â¦/â¢ re
sults of man's, progress made while left free to fol
low his individual interests, and to benefit "by his in
dividuarenterprise. During that century of progress
government invented nothing, it discovered. nothing,
it improved nothing, it constructed nothing. All
that Altgeld so truly pictured is the result of thatin
dividual effort which he proceeded \o denounce as
an evil and a scourge which must be suppressed by
driving it out of the field. in which it has produced
results so great that the Altgeld school thinks. them
worthy only of government' ownership.
He said: "The inventions, the discoveries and the
progress of the sciences during the last century
tended to shorten distances, to bring the different
parts of the earth together, and made it possible for
man to not only go quickly from one point to an
other, but they made it possible for him to execute
his will simultaneously in various places. Out of
this condition has come an era of consolidation and
concentrationâ little things are giving way to great
things. The result of this consolidation in itself
should be beneficial;, it cheapens the cost of pro
duction, and . in governments it should cheapen the
cost of operation, while in the railway world it
greatly increases the convenience of the public."
THE late Governor Altgeld made one of his
most .notable addresses, in Buffalo only ten
days before his death in favor of communistic
control af public utilities.

The farce comedy "On and Off," by
Alexander Bisson, was presented at the
Alcazar Theater last night and afforded
the evenly balanced stock company an
other opportunity of showing that in that
class of production it cannot â¢ be sur
passed. The piece is full of comical situ
ations, the dialogue is bright and spark
ling and the. laughter last night was in
cessant. The main characters are a justly
suspicious mother-in-law and a giddy
son-in-law. There are many complica
tions. M. L. Alsop was particularly ef
fective as the son-in-law and Marion Con
vere was fascinating as his wife. George
Osbourne, Henry Shumer, Howard Scott,
Walter Belasco, Harry Rattenbury, Lil
lian Elliott, Margaret Wycherley and Oza
Waldrop had parts that suited them ad
mirably. Juliet Crosby made her reap
pearance after a serious illness and
helped materially as a young girl with a
nervous affection in keeping up the fun.

Chief ' Clerk Augustus. Vibort said '.In
connection with the case that a man
claiming to be a discharged soldier and
penniless asked him for alms Saturday
and he gave him 60 cents. In doing so he
drew open the drawer, which contained
some silver and new pennies. As his re
membrance of the mendicant resembles
that given of the robber by the -watch
man, it is thought that he and the thief
are one person.
This was the story reported to the po
lice by John Eserlicht, the watchman.
He said he was accosted shortly after ,8
o'clock in the corridor of the 'building by
man who pushed a- revolver - before his
'face and told him to open the chief clerk's
ofiice. The watchman -obeyed, and .once
inside the robber ordered him to sit quiet
ly in a chair while . he j pried open the
desk and took about $20 in cash. He was
evidently disappointed at the result of ills
haul, as he cursed his lucK voluoly. TaK
ing the keys trom the watchman, tie Iock
ed him in the. room and <llsappeared. Soon
after Eserlicht managed to. attract the
attention of some one passing in tne cor
ridor and grained his release. He gave a
good description of the robber and me po
lice think tney will be able to apprehend
him. .

ing on a chair as the center of . a toast
to "La Madeleine!" Here the hero, . of
course, wanders In, and learns that: the
sweet .Marie is the notorious "La Made
leine.". Then there's trouble,- and now
comes an extract from "Monfe Cristo," a
Johnny-on-the-spot sort of' figure in the
shape of a mysterious priest. The priest
is ''reelly" the father of the hero, a
Marquis who murdered a man and got
jailed for it, but got a friend to say that
he pad died in prison of smallpox.
He, however, gets out to act aÂ« a sort
of guardian angel to his son; which he
does in a "Dam" sort. of way by per
suading La Madeleine to sell herself for
goldâ half a million of itâ to the Baron, in
order to redeem the ancestral. domain of
the Marquis, his eon.
The third act is lifted bodily, from
"Camille," gilded salon, reckless throw
ing around of lightweight dollars, half
million dollar checks and the like, though
the Inverted morality of ."Camllle". seems
to have turned a double somersault ; in
"La Madeleine." The guilty . papa takes
a hand here also, and the brother of the
man he killedâ Prince Rielof ârecognizes
him. But the Prince does quite the, usual
thing on such occasions, gives the. "glad
hand to his brother's murderer and a half
million dollar â¢ check , to La Madeleiner-to
free her from the Baron. La Madeleine
says, "Bless you, my long-lost parent.''
The last act, takes place in a church,
en the hero's wedding mom.,As a nice
little wedding gift "La Madeleine," after
imploring the hero to believe in . her,'
commits suicide * to . the tuno of-Crevln's
"My RoEary.". .-Â¦'.Â¦, . â¢;.

The Springfield Republican had this to
say in an editorial just after the publica

Taku incident:
Popular Ideas of heroes among' the men in

always In the thick of ' the grand and furious

as strong and wise . and brave In refusing . to
display his gunnery as the man .who, in his
position, would' have set the guns to booming?
The New York Sun had much to say at
different times upon this action. On July,
27. 1900, it very highly commended Ad
miral Kempff, and November 19 N 1901,- it
bitterly attacked the policy that'con

NAVAL OFFICER HOMEWARD
BOUND WHO GAINED FAME
IN CHINA.
Dr. William Elliot Griffls, oneof the au
thorities upon the affairs of the Far East,
After reading this fresh confirmation of the
wisdom and righteousness cf Admiral KempfTs
refusal .to attack the â¢ Taku forts : before the
Chinese Government nu known to have com
mitted a warlike act. .we -wonder why the
American people do not give him an ovation.
! Henry Savage iLandor has given . the
most complete and accurate histor3 r of the
Chinese^ crisis in his book." '.'China and
the Allies," which has become the stand
ard work upon these events. The "Na
tion," in its review of this work, gives
both its. opinion of Admiral Kempff's act
ions and a'.' summary . of the opinion of
Mr.' L-andor, as follows: .
' But for the extraordinary blundering of the
naval authorities, with 'the single exception -of
the United States admiral, there '.would have
been no necessity for the assembling of a great
army in China to save the foreigners. : â¢ The
American policy throughout the crisis has'been
calculated- to i allay .Chinese apprehension" and
make for T , -. * . â¢ ;. . â¢ - v â¢ ;
American Policy. Quieting.
William Cartrlght, Imperial Customs
Commissioner in China; made the follow
ing statement after his return to London,
and similar statements have- been^mads
on the floor of the British Parliament:
The incidents of the Taku campaign are
still fresh in the public mind. When the
Chinese troubles began Rear Admiral
Louis Kempff was attached to the Asiatic
station and' was ordered to 1 Taku from
Manila. There he Joined the fleets of the
allied powers, and when the bombardment
of the forts was decided upon Admiral
Kempff refused to join with the other na
tions and did not fire a shot during that
battle, while the other ships were batter
ing down the Chinese embankments.
When the American people heard of this
action there was a storm directed at their
admiral for his supposed cowardice. But
that . cowardice . has proved to be the
greatest heroism, for Admiral Kempff did
what he deemed his duty, even against
the advice of the admirals representing
the powers of the world, and^that duty
has proved to have been the. only right
move that was made upon Â¦ that day.
When Admiral Kempff reported Â¦ to the
Federal Government at Washington he
modestly said that he did not believe that
he had any right to initiate an' act of war
that would render more difficult the con
dition of the legations at Peking. It was
this reasoning that enabled- the United
States to -assume the position she did in
the East, for the Chinese have recognized
that the admiral of this country was the
only one who did not fire upon their flag.
When the position this country. had se
cured through this display â¢ of judgment
â¢was realized, advantage was taken of it
by the diplomats at Washington, and ad
vantage will be taken of it by the com
mercial leaders who desire. the trade of
the great empire of the Far East. .His
act has been praised by the great papers
of the country who watch these events
and by statesmen, diplomats . and histo
rians. â â¢Â¦:-'Â¦Â¦.' - Â¦
Bid What He Deemed His Duty.
The entire nation is interested in the
naval officer. The action of the American
admiral led Congressman Bartholdt to In
troduce a resolution in the House thank-
Ing the rear admiral for his -.meritorious
conduct at Taku, China.. It-was his wis
dom that caused foreign . diplomats and
statesmen to publicly announce in foreign
Parliaments â¢ that the American admiral
was the one man who made no mistakes
in those trying times, while historians
have given him the same credit.
REAR Admiral Louis Kempff, the
commander of the American fleet
at the bombardment of the Taku
forts, is on his way to San Fran
" cisco and will arrive on the Pa
cific Mall Steamship Company's Peking,
which is due to arrive to T day. . Thi?
will be the first time Â¦â¢ he has
visited the United States since the
memorable event In the history
of the Orient During the stirring times
In China the naval officer was the repre
sentative of this country, and although
criticized at that time for his conduct the
criticism has given way to approval, and
the admiral has been complimented on
every side for his judgment in not partici
pating in the attack on the forts.
The coming of Admiral Kempff is of
double interest to the residents of this
State - by reason . of ; the fact that Â¦ he is
practically a Californian. He has seen
more service about San Francisco Bay
than in any other section of the world.
He was for many years the commandant
of the liare Island Navy Yard. He mar
ried in San Francisco and his family, a
wife and two children, are residents of
the Hotel Metropole, in Oakland. His
eldest son is an officer on the U. S. S.
Albatross, doing duty out of this port. It
any State can claim Admiral Kempff It is
California.
This' is the man who will land in San
Francisco ; within the 'next -few 1 days, > al
most announced, and who will go quietly
to his home in Oakland. And. while the
foreign admirals, whose own countrymen
oharge them with having made blunders
through pointing to : Admiral Kempff as
the, man who did right, are ] being pro
moted and honored for even their blun
ders, the'- American' commander has not
only not been advanced, but the resolution
of thanks still slumbers with a committee
of Congress. While the men whom he de
tailed from his fleet to. aid in the march
on Peking have every, one been advanced
in rank and otherwise honored, the man
who assumed all of the responsibility and
upon; whom the blame for failure would
have fallen, returns to his own country
without a welcome save from his family,
and. without the advance in rank that was
awarded. to his subordinates.

Martial Law in Cape Colony.
The Premier, Lord Salisbury, .was called
on to defend the Government in the House
of Lords yesterday by a motion of Earl
Spencer (Liberal), demanding detailed in
formation %regarding. martial -law, courts
martial and executions in Cape Colony.
Lord Coleridge (Liberal), who followed,
declared that martial, law was imposed
over a vast area of South Africa where
not a shot has been fired and where there
is no resistance to Government authority.
Lord Salisbury said martial law was a
mere fashion of speech. What every one
admitted was that it was necessary to de
feat the designs of the King's enemies In
South Africa. This the Government was
determined to do, and he added, naive
ly, there was plenty of armed resistance
in Cape Colony to fully justify the appli
cation of martial law. ,
To Investigate Contracts.

select committee to investigate the whole
commercial history of the South African
war, including the contracts for the 'pur

the contracts, for. freight and. transpor
tation, saying that in. so doing he was
only fulfilling a, moral duty and echoing
a j sentiment . deeply felt : throughout the
country.,, ;" â¢ ." /
War Secretary Brodrick replied that the
Government did not fear an investiga
tion. -It was true. that in ' operation" of
the magnitude of those in" South Africa
there must have been mistakes and
shortcoming?, and the War Office would
demand, as its right, an. investigation <&t

Special Dispatch to The'.Cail.
3L,ife-Savin^ Crew to the Rescue
The scene of the accident was in the
well-known tide rips off Monomy Point,
which makes down from Chatham to
Nantucket Sound. Last Thursday the
barges Wadena and John C. Fitzpatrick,
on the way to Boston with cargoes of
coal, stranded on the Shovful Shoal, about
three-quarters of a mile off Monomy
Point. S!nce then every effort has been
made to float the barges and all day Sat
urday and Sunday men from Vineyard
Haven were at work throwing coal over
board from both of them. *
Last night the tug Peter Smith, which
has Keen lyir.fr beside the barges, ran
alongside the AVadena and told those on
board that a storm was coming on. All
the wreckers were taken on board the tug
with the exceptipn of the five men who
met their fate to-day. Mack, who had
come on from Cleveland, refused to leave
and ordered the captain of the Smith to
anchor near by. About 8 o'clock, the
weather growing very thick, the captain
of the tus decided to run into Hyannis.
Upon arrival there the captain tried In
vain to notify the Monomy life-savers
that there were five men left on board
i he Wadena. which being further out on
the shoal was in a more dangerous place
than the Fitzpatriclc This forenoon Cap
tain Eldredge, who had bee-i watching the
har?res, sighted signals of distress on the
Wadcnn. He got out his crew and surf
boat. The wind was blowing nearly a
gale from the southeast. 50 preparations
were made to launch the boat on the in
side of the point, where the water was
Emooth- The crew had no difficulty in
getting off, but after, rounding the point
it took nearly an hour to reach the barge.
By that time the tide had turned to the
eastward and a fierce cross-sea had been
kicked up. Captain Eldredge steered the
lifeboat under the lee <3! the Wadena, and
one after another the five men dropped
into the boat. With the wind astern it
seemed comparatively easy to gain the
smooth waters behind the point. The
seas were tossing an'd turning in the
rips, and Captain Eldredge was constant
ly looking for smooth spots.
Tremendous Sea Overturns Boat.
When about half-way in he thought he
discovered one over what he called a hole,
and the beat was sheered off for it. As .
she did so a tremendous sea caught her
under the stern and she went over, throw
ing all the men into the water. Being used
to theses, all the life-savers -clung to the
boat and managed to pull the Wadena (
men along with them. An attempt was
made to right the boat, but although. all
lifeboats are supplied with cork gunwales
they are heavy, and being full of water
the life-savers only managed to get her
partially cleared. They had some hope,
however, of reaching land until another
â¢wave again capsized the boat. Mack was
the first to succumb, and one by one the
others dropped away until there wero
only four left, and these climbed on the
bottom of the overturned boat. All were
fearfully exhausted. The four men drift
ed down In the direction of the Fitzpat
rick. where Captain Mayo of that craft
caught sight of them. With much daring
he dropped a dory overboard, then jump-
Ing in it started after the exhausted men.
Before he reached the lifeboat three of
the men had fallen into the sea, Ellis
managed to hold on and caught the rope
which Captain Mayo threw him. He was
dragged aboard, and then Captain Mayo,
being an expert surfman, pulled around
â¢the point into the smooth water and
landed the only survivor of the thirteen
who started from the barge.
CHATHAM. Mass.. March 17.â By the
capsizing of a lifeboat to-day seven life-,
savers, practically the entire crew of the
Jionomy station, .on the south end of
Cape Cod, met death at .their post of duty
and with them Into the sea went live
men from the Etrar.ded barge Wadena,
whom they tried to bring In safety to the
shore. One man, Lemuel Ellis, through
the heroic work of Captain Elmer Mayo
of another stranded barge, the John C.
Fitzpatrick, was rescued trom the bottom
of the upturned lifeboat. Among -those
lost was William H. Mack of Cleveland,
who was on the barge representing his
company, the Bouitile leading ana
XrunspJrtaXlon Company of that trÂ»ty.
Captain Marshall ti. EidreUge, one oi
the oldest me-saVera on the coast, went
tlown with his men. All the life-savers
came from Chatham and Harwich. Tne

ecalp In scales, as It burrows' down to t the
Toota of. the hair, where" It destroys -'the
hair's vitality, causing: falling -' hair; Â¦, and,
ultimately, baldness. After ; Prof.' Urina
of Hamburg, : Germany, discovered the
dandruff germ all efforts to findaremedy
failed until the great, laboratory- discov-
ery was made which resulted . in. New-

SALT LA&E, March 17.â Jack Clifford,
the sturdy little California lightweight,
knocked out Jack Wade, the lightweight
champion of Montana, in the thirteenth
round of a scheduled twenty-round bout
at the Salt Lake Athletic Club to-night.
The blow that did the business was a
right hook squarely on the point of the
chin, and Wade did not recover for some
time after being dragged to his corner.
The fight v/as a very, fast one after the
third round. For the first four round3
Wade was the aggressor, though he
fought very carefully, paying a great
deal of attention to Clifford'3 stomach
with his ri?ht.
In, the sixth round Clifford sent Wade to
the floor with a right to the chin, and
after that slowly but surely fought his
way to 'victory. "Wade went down again
In the ninth and was very weak. He came
up surprisingly strong for the tenth, how
ever, and had Clifford in a bad way for a
moment. But Clifford evened matters up
and In the twelfth sent Wade to the floor
five times. The knockout blow came
about the middle of the thirteenth round
during a fierce mix-up in Clifford's corner.

subsided last, night/.,, and , to-day -the
weather was generally fair, but intensely
cold, the thermometer ranging from 10 to
16 below zero. With the subsidence of the
storm, the ' railroads are bending their
energy to again open their ' lines for
traffic,- aud immense rotary snow plows
and gangs of men with pick and shovel
are attacking the mountainous drifts that
block the tracks. . The Great Northern
has succeeded In opening "Its line as far
west as Church's Ferry. N. D., and the
road is expected to be clear as far as Mi
not by morning. This will open an ave
nue of escape for the transcontinental
trains on that road, which have been

At 6 a. m. yeslerfiay the animal keepers

oars to try to make them leave the cage
and walk . into i the kennel, spread with
tempting meat. ,
Old Wallace, the k'ri? lion of "the menag

When one of the party inquired what
had impressed him most, the Prince re
plied that the great, orderly- and cheer-,
ful crowds had been his most continuous
Impression and would probably always be
one of his ' most vivid impressions. ? â¢
The Prince said he saw crowds out of
doore and indoon?, faces of men and
women, with here and there a powerful,
a beautiful spiritual face. He said his
regret, if he dared to say he had any.
was that he â¢ could not Know some ot
those people better.
The reports that Prince Henry would
occupy a different position In Germany in
the future and live at Berlin, instead of
continuing his "active ' sea life, are un
founded. He will hoist his flag upon his
arrival at Kiel, and will resume the train-
Ing of his squadron. The Prince will take
a squadron to England next June for the
naval review on the occasion of the coro
nation of King Edward.
â¢ Prince Henry says he was so tired when
he finally | boarded .'the at
New- York that he Â« slept', almost continu
ously! for forty-eight hours, except for the
time"when he appeared for his meals or
tb take-, short ".walks on the bridge. He
says- he. never worked so hard in/ his life
as when he-was in the -United States, that
he never. changed" his 1 ' uniform so many
times a day or faced a'successlon of situ
ations'requiring such alertness and a cer
tain initiative on his own part. There
were situations which' could, not be met
with merely formal .behavior, or the me
chanical 'execution ' of ; a , routine pro
gramme. '.While i conversing .'with mem
bers of his suite Prince 'Henry has alluded
to many â¢ things in connection with â¢ his
trip. He has mentioned- nothing more
frequently than that no single unpleasant
Incident occurred in the United States.
Ideas, scenes and impressions were crowd
ed upon him too rapidly lor proper appre
ciation at the- moment, perhaps", but as
Prince Henry, himself said, "We have ac
cumulated .material to think ' about for

- ST. PETERSBURG. March 17.â A stu
dents' riot here to-day. In which over
lmi people engaged, kept a large force oÂ£
police and cavalry busy throughout tha
day. Probably 100 arrests were made, but
the repressive measures were not so strict
as on the corresponding Sunday of LOL
While "many persons, were injured no
fatalities were reported.
The Â¦ students placarded the city last
night announcing that tney intended 10
hoid a grievance meeting, and the au
thorities, taking the hint, made extensive
preparations. Tne whole police was called
out and the military was held ready for
mobilization, cavalry patrols supplement
ing the mounted police. Additional squad
rons of cavalry, Â¦ light batteries of artil
lery and detachments of infantry were
packed in the side streets. The crowcu
increased Jn the main tnoroughfares until
noon, when the cavalry omcer In Com
mand of a squadron in front of the Hotel
d'Europe begged the crowd there to dis
perse and go home. The demonstrators
refused, and the mounted troops began
slowly clearing the streets.
At 12:30 p. m. the students attempted to
organize a procession In front of the hotel
mentioned, singing revolutionary songs
and shouting "free Russia," "down with
the autocracy." The police and cavalry
then charged, but used only their cossacic
whips and the flat of their sabers. Many
persons were hurt, but only a few were
seriously Injured. The fighting continued
during the remainder of the afternoon,
breaking out In fresh places continually.
One of the most severe fights of the day
was concluded only a few minutes before
the Czarina, In an. open sleigh, passed the
spot where It occurred. Carriages of the
nobility and members of the Imperial
household were several Â¦ times mixed up
in the melees. The authorities made ef
forts to prevent bloodshed, and in this
they were remarkably successful, consid
ering the magnitude of the demonstra
tion.
The fact that General ' Miles' recom
mendation has been turned -down should
not carry with it, the authorities state,
any Idea of. ill-feeling, against the . com
manding general. ; \and, they.vregrpt that
he is inclined; to." 'view 'it- In" -any. such light.
By his .'antagonism of. the admlnistra
tioni General; Miles, has placed \ himself
alongside, the political opponents of the
-President, -and ."this-may-; serve -.to-, widen
the, breach between 1 the. army headquar
ters and the White House. General Miles
has determined to' fight the army staff
bill, which Secretary Root has prepared
and which he. Is. pushing. before Congress.'
This bill- contemplates: the abolition, of
the office of commanding general. because
of the 'friction . that, has always existed
between Its incumbent and the Secretary
of War. -.-Â¦", . â¢. â¢
On this indorsement, . Secretary Root
stated that it seemed unwise or inexpe
dient to him to inaugurate ' a policy so
entirely different from that in force, and
which was producing such satisfactory re
sults. To do so would be to discredit the
work of Governor. Taft and his associates
on the Philippine Commission and â¢ of
General Chaffee, : who : now - has the mili
tary situation well in hand,- and would
only create the impression among Filipi
nos that the- United States was display
ing weakness and, vacillation to continue
the war. The President concurred in the
Secretary's views. . :Â¦.-Â¦
Would Not . Discredit Taft.
It is authoritatively stated that there
was no personal animosity on the part
of the; President and Secretary Root in
disapproving General Miles' recommenda
tion. Before â¢'. acting Secretary Root '. ais
cussed the plan with Governor Taft, and
also ! obtained the. views, of Major Gen
eral Chaffce, commanding the American
forces in the. Philippines. These officials
were opposed to adopting the scheme.
The final blow to 1 General Miles' friendly
relations with the executive, in\ the opin
ion of his friends,- occurred . when the
President officially ; concurred in r the - rec
ommendation of- Secretary.' Root that
General Miles' plan â¢ for tne pacttlcatlon
of the Philippines Â¦Â¦Â¦ be not < adopted.-, This
contemplated the selection' of half a dozen
Cubans and half, a 1 .. dozen Porto Rlcans,
who should accompany : General Ml iela to
the Philippines. These men would be
given an opportunity to, talk with the Fili
pinos regarding the beneficent results of
American rule in their islands. After a
short stay- in the -archipelago, General
Miles proposed to induce promi
nent. Flllplnps -to come; yto'V the United
States for the purpose of studying Ameri
can institutions. . This plan '.had > brought
successful results in treatlngtoith the In
dians, and General \ Miles was'vconfldent
that it would be "equally advantageous in
aiding the settlement , of the Filipino in

Special Dispatch to The tall.'.-" ' Â¦"Â¦
The trouble has been brewing for sev
eral days, but did not come to a climax
until yesterday shortly before noon. Then
it was decided that an 'amicable settle
ment could not be had and war was de
clared. The police: were Immediately in
formed and detectives and patrolmen were
on the qui vlve in order to prevent blood
shed. Highbinders were dispatched from
the headquarters of each tong. heavily
armed and spurred oh to murder by the
offer of large prices that had been placed
on the heads of members of the rival
tongs. Officer Tillman made the first ar
rest and when the Chinese found that the
police had been informed that the war
was on they became 'more cautious and
resorted to the stealthy methods pursued
in previous 1 troubles.
Chinatown is again in a tremor of ex
citement owing to a. war which has been
declared between- fwo of the most power
ful factions within its limits. The Wong
family and the Four Families have dis
agreed on the question of punishment
which should be inflicted upon some of
the members of the former tong.who ab- m
sconded with money that had been ad-*
vanced on condition that they go to the
Alaskan fisheries. A carnival ot carmine
hue is likely to be the result. Already
one of the Wong family highbinders Is
under arrest. He was taken in custody
yesterday by Officer Jack Tillman -while
patrolling the streets with a large re
volver in quest of an enemy.

went peacefully, without giving the least
outward sign that Â«he meditated any
change in the straight-laced life that she
had always led. until she reached Wilkins

avenue and Fulton street. Here, without
a moment's notice, she turned and made
direct for the swinging doors. The llamas
looked on with amazement, but Princess
did not hesitate, not even when the 90-foot
porch broke beneath her ponderous feet.
Right into the saloon she went and made
straight for the lunch counter.

twenty men. Not appreciating this strange

lettuce. Ao this was all that the counter

between,. Point Arena and Point Reyes, he
Showed No Green Light.
Matthew Turner . is building for himself a
four-masted schooner, at - Benlcia which is to
bear his own name. - Turner has bunt ' many
vessels and on occasion's has-been hard pressed
for suitable names for the product of his yard.
He" declared some years ago that he wanted
to turn out .a- vessel bearing his name, but
would not so christen a craft unless he could
personally : select /every stick of timber Â¦ that
went into her and supervise the construction
from the laying of the keel to the stepping of
the masts. He has been able at last to fulfill
these .conditions. " The M. Turner is now in the
frame and. when she Is finished- will be the
test four-masted ischoon-r Matthew Turner
knows how to build. - , , ' ..
Will Bear Builder's Name.
Plaintiff 'alleges that it delivered cer
tain building material to R. P. Hurlbut to
the value of 54715 45, anfl that there Is an
unpaid balance of $1547 63. The Stone
Company also delivered to Silas Palmer
material, to the value of $9821 30, and it
wants judgment for both these amounts,
with $1000 attorney fees. Mrs. Stanford

that the course jpf true love runs oft
askew. After preparing a home for a
bride he had to. marry her twice before
inducing her to live in it, and then she
forsook him. As if that were not trouble
enough, Campbell's father-in-law, John
Baxter, had him arrested here to-day on
a charge of perjury. .
Six weeks ago Campbell arrived from
Red Bluff, procured a license in this
county to marry Ella Mary Baxter and
â¢then went back to have the knot tied.
The couple were married In ed Bluff, but
upon producing the license learned that
it was void outside of Shasta County.

Weds Same Girl Twice
and Is Arre3ted for
T 'HE steam collier Asuncion, which
arrived yesterday after a tumult
uous voyage from Tacoma, has
added one . more chapter 'to the
hi3tory of submarine navigation.
For four days of the five days and
eighteen hours of '. her i voyage the Asun
cion was.', under water. How she escaped j
foundering Is a marvel to shipping folk, i
but Captain Evans declares that he could
have carried 500 tons of coal more than he
brought down.
The Asuncion left Tacorr.a March. 11
and rounded Cape Flattery In "a howling
southwester. Heavy seas swept over the
deeply laden coal carrier, and at 3 a. m. I
of the following day she gave up the
struggle, turned tail and ran back for the
shelter of the straits. Storm signals were
flying at Neah Bay. Captain Kvans de
cided to. anchor in .Clallam Bay until the
weather cleared upl. Clallam Bay,', how
ever, was already crowded with sailing
craft, so the'Asuncion continued the re
treat until she reached Port- Angeles,
where she remained at anchor until the
storm signals were hauled down! .~\ â¢ .Â¦Â¦"Â¦
She resumed her voyage. After round
ing Cape Flattery the wind and sea. again
got angry. Their violence increased until
a heavy, gale was blowing, accompanied
by a tremendous beam sea. It was then
that the Asuncion went under. â¢-'â The
smokestack remained out of water and
the officers on the bridge, although' Â«e
pcatedly drenched by big seas, managed
to get along without an artificial air sup
ply. fThe rest of the vessel disappeared,
however, and it was only by the thump
of the machinery that the men on the
bridge knew she was still attached to the
upper works. She was hove to on March
14 for four hours, during which time sucli
of her as was not submerged was peltad
with hall and snow. The latter part- of
the trip was made in fairly good weather.
The Asuncion is an unlucky, ship so far
as weather is concerned, but lucky In sur
viving conditions that would destroy most
vessels of her class. Vessels leaving
northern parts before and after her made
good weather. The Mackinaw, which left
Tacoma only a few hours before the
Asuncion, came down in ninety-two
hours.. The- Asuncion's voyage occupied
138 hours.

When light finally came the exhausted
crew saw that the schooner.' had 'been
beaten, to pieces > during -the morning
hours, and the debris ; was washing
ashore on the beach. A hunt through the
wreckage failed to bring to light any
thing in the way of canned goods for
food. With a last look . at the lost
schooner, the men plied into â¢ the dory
again; after digging a few, clams, and
set out, pulling down the shore of tha
island. 1 hey uid not know how far thev
were from civilization, and took the only
chance, of reaching help. Twenty-four
hours after leaving the scene of the wreck
the steamship Queen City was seen
"steaming along between Ahousett and
Ciayoquot. The boatload of men werw
seen from the vessel and she bore down
upon them. The captain of the steam
ship took them and . their dory aboard
and 'gave them every care possible. The
wet; and bedraggled clothing was ex
changed for dry garments and the terri
ble craving for food was satisfied 'Â¦Â¦ with
an abundant luncheon. " Afterward they
were transferred to the Rosalie. ,
the> southwest.* . ' â¢
. At . 3 o'clock .in the morning there was
a. terrible crash as the Wonoma struck
on the | rocks. "A moment previously Â¦ she
had driven " into the combing breakers,
and the : 300-pound anchoro had been
thrown over the! side in an 'endeavor" too
escape -the*- rocks. The gale sent her
ahead ' despite the anchor. 'A . dory Â¦ was
hurriedly launched and. all live men
scrambled Into the craft ', without eveu
waiting to get provisions. They, suc
ceeded, in reaching the shore, drenched
from ' head to foot and half drowned by
the flying spray. Until daylight ap
peared they, crouched under the lee iol
projecting rocks, seeking protection from
the rain 'and wind. ' . . . â¢
These' men. had a remarkably narrow
escape from death. The Wonoma now
lies von the rocky shore of the island,
broken : into kindling wbod.\ " The j ..vessel
was '.first "caught . in . a Sheavy southerly
gale. oft" Cape Scott and had. a hard tussle
through, the storm. ', Afterward her crew
succeeded in working "northward again
until -March'*- 11,*.. when 'she was caught -in

The letter he received yesterday told
cf the cpening and acceptance of. a stretch
of road several miles. long, reaching from
Manvel en the Santa Fe railroad lines to
the great dry lake, through which the
California and Nevada State lines run.
Manvel is about at the summit of the
Vanderbilt mountains, which have been
a formidable obstacle to the tourists who
have made their, way in past years into
Death Valley. At the great dry lake the
mountains have been crossed and there
is a somewhat easy passage into the val
ley for pack trains and wagons. The
new line is the California Eastern. In
adddition - to furnishing an entrance to
Death Valley this road also is supplying
means to reach the Toriopah mines, and
also the Searchlight mining district in
Southern Nevada. . The. line does not en
ter. Death Valley, . but "reaches a point
from which it is comparatively an easy
journey to the desolate district over which
loom the Panamint Mountains.
The fcuthern gateway of the dreaded
Death Valley, home of the rattlesnake
and the Glla monster and the sepulcher
of scores of advent utqus and ill-fated
miners, has been broken open. Such is
the news received yesterday in a letter
by Professor Bailey of the State Mining
Bureau. Not Jong ago Professor Bailey
went through Death Valley, studying the
entire region, and especially investigat
ing the vast saline deposits that are esti
mated to contain material Â¦worth count
lers millions of dollars when once it is
laid down in commercial pcints all over
the world. His great Interest in the val
ley has led him to keep In touch with
people in that vicinity.

Greater Than Assertion.
There is none of us so hardened but
that when vie have" been able to aid our
fellow creatures by conferring a benefit
or bringing a little comfort into their
lives we like to have appreciation
shown. This generally affords more
pleasure than the performance of .the
act itself, and in this connection the
following, letter, from a Paris, Texas,
lady is of more than usual interest:
"Dear Friends: I address you as such,
for you have been such to me. I suf-
fered for three years off and on with
p!:cs. 1 was treated 'at the hospital, and
the new and elegant hospital of Mem-
phis: they only gave me temporary - re-
lief. I came West, thinking the change
of air cr.d v.-ater xvould benefit me: fivs
months ago the bleeding piles came back
on me, and bled so much that I thougtit
I would die. I have had four of the
Bftest doctors in this section of Texa;;
all they did was to finally nearly let me
go to my grave; all they wanted was a
big sum of money from me and to op-
crate on me. 1 said no; . no surgeon's
knife would enter me; If it was my time
lo die. God knew it. and when I died 1
would die all together. I . began . hear-
ing about your . medicine. I ha,d no
faith in you. but I sent and got a box
of your Pyramid Pile Cure;, in two days
the blood flow had slackened to one-half
tbc amount, and in one week I Â£e!t- -so
njuch better I walked four block3 and
c!Id a Uttle housework. I was not bleed-
irg then; in three weeks I was well.
<iod tiess you for putting such, a won-
derful medicine within the reach of suf-
Jeriiig men and. women. 1 shall never
Â«ast? to recommend your medicine or
he without, it; also J used your Pyramid
Pills. Bailie A. Hearndon." Testimony
like this should be more convincing than
all claims and assertions, and shouid
leave no doubt in the mind of the reade.-
as to the merit of the remedy. Pyramid
Pile Cure is sold by druggists for fifty
cents a package, or will be mailed by
tbe makers to any address on receipt of
price. Write Pyramid Drug Co., Mar-
shall, Mich., for their book on cause
and cure of piles.

ADVERTISEMENTS.NEW YORK. March 17.â The general specu
lative sentiment Jn Wall street was a good
deal encouraged by the improved condition of
the money outlook, as disclosed by the Satur
day bsnk statement. There was no 'absolute
Improvement in the condition of the banks dis
closed by that document, but there had been
more or less dread last week that the surplus
reserve would be entirely wiped out by tho
Kuuiy drains upon the cash reserves.'. The large
loan contraction actÂ«d as _ an offset to this
drain, and the absence -of 'disturbance In the
market while this was being done dissipated a
good deal of the anxiety felt- over the money
outlook. It was this consideration that prompt
ed the traders to bid up the opening prices for
Ftocks. It de\-eloped. however during the
course of .the day that the professional contln*
cent BtlU make up the market to a large ex
tent, and vny little following was attracted
by the advancing tendency of the. market. The
principal operations also were inclined to re

MONDAY, March 17.
STOCK AND' BOND j EXCHANGE.
CHICAGO, March 17. â Good Judges of , trade
influences declared at the. opening of business
that the wheat news should put 2 cents on
the prices of futures to-day. World's statis
tics were bullish, Liverpool stocks were de
creased ' and Liverpool cables showed a' quick
rally to firmness In the English 'markets. But
the chief bullish factor was the hard freeze
over the Western States. The thermometer
was down to zero In the, winter'wheat-sec
tions, where the warm weather and rains had
Elarted growing. 1 Coarse grains were higher,
Minneapolis reported" a good cash demand,
with No. 2 Northern selling at May . prices,
and No. .1 at l@lVSc premium. These in
fluences did induce a substantial advance at
the opening, but the early prices ; were the
beet of the day.- May 'started Â¦Â¦"4@*"6c- higher
at 75%c to 70 cents and haggled for the first
hour. Shorts had evened 'up pretty well Sat
urday, and consequently there was not ; such
a nervous tension as there would have been
had the freeze come last week. The commis
sion houses had a good supply of : buying or
ders to execute, but the big local professionals
were callously indifferent to the situation and
Jet the outsider attempt to bring the few re
maining heavy shorts to their ,Â£nees. Trade
jrrew light early, when prices eased -to 75"K,c
Here ' May rested for some time. . Then bears
thought they saw a latent weakness in the
pit and -started in to hammer out ' the small
fry. A number of crop damage reports came
to hand but had little effect.- The last- half
hour of trade was excited â¢ and - prices for-Mav
plunged down to 74%c, closing weak' V,SALc
lower at 74%@74~J6c- . -;-. . ,..: , ..Tr
Corn - trade . was almost a repetition of .the
experience in wheat. May closed weak. *4c
down, at Cl%0G2c. '-.- Â¦ - weaK ' , %c
Oats followed the lead of other grains. May
closed weak. %@%c, lower, at 44%c. "â¢ >
There .was a sharp advance early, in provis
ions, but a . late weakness in sympathy / with
the drop in grain casued the entire list to sell
below Saturday'!! close. May pork closed 7V4@
10c lower, lard 6c down and ribs 2*4@5c ott

Eggs stand the same, but tho feeling is. not

some are largely over-supplied. It is reported
that ' some dealers are , bidding more '. in â¢ the

NEW YORK. March 17.â The Cpmmerclal
Advertiser's London financial cablegram sayo:
Although 'Stock Exchanre business did not
increase to-day, there was a better tendency,
forced sales In mines having ceased. There
were symptoms of bear covering. Consols
were weak, but apparently the only cause was
a few cash sales In 4 quiet market. American
shares were quiet, but business In this quar
ter was very small. London bought a few
shares in the street. ' - Â¦ (,
Rio Tintos were down %. , , - Â¦/ Â¦
Copper statistics show increases of stocks of
731. tons, and of supplies of 1456 ton*. The
drop in Amalgamated Copper caused talk over
here that it is the American policy to break
copper, and New York sales of Rio Tintos con
firm this idea. It is . predicted that Amal
gamated will touch 60. - The metal was down
% to Â£53% a ton:
Gold Is off %d to '77s 9d.

that none will be admitted who have not

precaution is taken to prevent a packed
audience which might disturb the har
mony of the meeting.
Â¦ A full representation of the members of
Carpenters'; Union. No. 4S3 was held last
nfght ;at the Labor Bureau on Market
street. The object, of the meeting, which
brought out' a full attendance, numbering
over 650 active members of the union, was
to make arrangements for a general meet
ing of the brotherhood of all the' carpen
ters and joiners In this city on next
Thursday night at Metropolitan Hall. At
this meeting existing matters of vital Im
portance to the brotherhood will be dealt
with by the principal speaker, J; F.
Grimes, and others interested in the work
which Is at present somewhat disturbing
the carpenters of the, city. It Is a well
recognized fact that there is and has been
discrimination, against the members of
No. 483 by certain other labor organiza
tions not directly affiliated with the San
Francisco Labor Council. It is to adjust
this difference that the meeting of the
entire brotherhood has been called. . Â¦ .

pear also before "the Federal court,: he
contended, that the property of the com

Act of Kansas Arbitrary.
A great" deal was said in this case about the
comparative character of stockyard companies,
and railroad companies, as to their doing busi
ness in whichthe public has an interest. Â¦ and
also as to the /measure by which the reason
ableness -of., rates ..of . charges should be. fixed,
but the sole point decided was that the act of
Kansas , was invalid because it made an ar
bitrary classification of ' stockyards and dis
criminated against certain companies In that
business. '
Other cases from Circuit and 1 State Â¦ courts
were cited by counsel, but as the question in
volved is a constitutional question it will be ,
unnecessary to consider the decision of courts
other than those of the Supreme Court of the
United States, the court of last resort in this
country.-. .Â¦
Considering these decisions as above -quoted
from, as well in their full text. I am of the
opinion that this court | has full and complete
Jurisdiction over the persona to and the sub
ject matter of this action, and that the com
plaint, taken as confessed, for "the purposes
of Â¦ the demurrer, presents a good and suf
ficient cause of- action, and that the court .is
warranted !n taklns such evidence as may
be necessary to . determine the issues made by
the parties in their complaint and the answer
filed thereto. ....The. objection to the court's
Jurisdiction is overruled.
The demurrer is overruled.
The motion to dissolve the temporary re
straining order ia denied. â¢
-It ia conceded that . a State has a right,
through Its Legislature, or through a j Board
of Railroad 'Commissioners duly elected or ap
pointed, to limit, the amount of charzes by a
railroad company for toe transportation of
persons and property within its Jurisdiction,
and this,, the act of fixing auch
charges be Judicial, legislative or administra
tive; that it is a legitimate exercise -of the
police power of a State over a business affect
ed with a public interest. ' This is supported
by all the cases.
It ia conceded that defendants, the Board
of i Railroad Commissioners of the State of
California, . have sach power delegated to- them
by the constitution and the statutes of the
State. . - -
â¢ Â¦ Here the learned counsel begin to differ, and
diametrically construe, the decisions of. the Su
preme Court of the United States in cases in

fore: this .court for, determination: has the
court â¢ Jurisdiction to inquire into the reason
ableness of. the schedule of rates for the trans
portation.- of â¢ crude r>etrole,um oil In the State
of California, as fixed by the Board of Rail
road' Commissioners .of the State on the 2d
day of -December. ,1901? and upon the solu
tion of this question depends all of the rulinga
a iked for by either party. â¢ .- â¢â¢
Many Points Conceded.
This low rate of transportation the rail
road company: claims is made in order to
develop the oil regions. The reduction
proposed by the commission, the company
claims further, will result in a yearly loss
of Â¥72,000 to it.' . 'â¢
Continuing, Judge Hebbard says:
Upon many points of the law involved in
such a case as this counsel are agreed. It U
conceded that where . private proaerty, such
as; railroad property. .- Is ' devoted to a public
use, .it Is subject to oublic- regulation. The
owner thereof may withdraw his grant by dis
continuing the use, but so long as he main^
tains the uee he must submit to the control.
Would Develop Oil Region.
The railroad company claims that the
cost of transportation of oil amounts to
9.2 mills ner ton per mile, and that Its
rate of 42 cents per barrel, which the
commission seeks, to reduce, yields an
amount- equal to only 8.2 mills per ton per
mile.
On the 16th day of April, 1901, one John
Le Blanc filed with defendants a complaint
against alalntift and other railroad corpora
tions, alleging that from points in Kern and
Fresno counties. California, to-wlt:. Bakers
tield. Kern River oil district, McKlttrlck . oil
district, Sunset oil district, Coallnjra.- and OU
City, crude petroleum oil Â¦ was transported by
said corr>oratlons to all points south of the
city of San Francisco, and to said city, with
out rerard to the distance over which, the
same was transported, at a uniform rate for
such transportation of 42 cents per barrel, and
that over 42 cents per barrel was charged fov
transportation to points north of San Fran
cisco. Le Blanc also alleged that, certain
switching, charges made by said corporations
at Oil City were excessive. Thereupon an
order -to show cause was issued and served on
this plaintiff: that plaintiff appeared in saM
proceeding, and that on December 2. 1901, de
fendants made an order therein, without anv
other hearing exceat upon the . petition and
order to show cause therein, fixing a schedule
of rate3 to be charged for the transportation
of crude petroleum oil In the State of Califor
nia.
In an opinion covering twenty-one close
ly written typewritten, pages handed
down by Judge Hebbard yesterday In the
oil rate case it is decided that the court
has jurisdiction over the subject matter
of the complaint. The point passed upon
was raised by. the Railroad Commission
in. an argument supporting a motion to
dismiss a temporary Injunction restrain
ing the commission from enforcing its
new schedule of rates. .
The motion to dismiss was denied by
Judge Hebbard, | and the demurrer to. the
complaint overruled. The case will now
be tried on its merits. ' â¢ â¢

-Your commlttit. therefore, in the interest of
harmony and because of the considerations
rtated. accepts the sureestions of his Honor,
the Mayor, and recommends to this honorable
board that the hydrant rate be fixed at $2
per l-ydrant instead of $2 50, as heretofore
recommended by your committee, and that the
rates otherwise remain unchanged.
',Tour committee would add, by way of re
faiatlon of the criticism of Its action in its
previous Â¦ recommendations, that in arriving
at the value of tbe properties of the Spring
Valley Water Works It did not count amonp
those rrc^ertles the naked legal franchise of
the company to do business, in express terms.
Whether or not the franchise of the comnany
ran leritlmatcly be considered property "used
by the company in supplying the city with
â¢water Is ei cuestlon of law. of which ' your
committee knows cf no Adjudication. Tour
j committee in determlnics the value ot the so
called franchise of the company took Into con
rlderation the meaning: of that word In the
sense riven to It by the City Engineer.
Another chanre made, viz, that the com
mittee had recommended a rate which would
Klve the company more than it asked by
J 43.000, -fa ridiculous. The very fact that the
Mayor rrorwses in his message to rive Â¦ the
company only S24.O00 ler.s revenue than the
committee recommended would apparently an
pwer that charge. But. independently of mere
Inference, an honest examination of the figures
*hows that the amount asked for by the
Spring Valley Water Work* was $2,0C5 500
Â«see fichunsler Rep., p. 3). and the amount
recommended by the majority of the commit

termination cf the values of properties of such
vact marnltude there must enter, necessarily,
in feme measure, the element of uncertainty,
that the estimated operating expenses of the
comr^ny r.re not ascertalnable with absolute
Â¦precision; the taxes, of cours;.. are. fixed, . and
on their amornt the Mayor and the majority
of , the committee arree.
The vital point of. this investigation is the
determination of the. rates to be established.
An examination into the value of the proper
tlss of the fiprins Valley Water Works actu
ally in use In the supply of water to the city
and of the i>rcba.ble amount of the operating
cxT>ens?Â£ that will be Incurred by the com
pany and the amount of t^xes that it will
have to pay is essential, but incidental to the
determination of those raxes. .
' The majority report recommended that th-/
rates remain the tame, with the exeeDtlon-of
the hydrant rates, which it proposed to change
from a lump Bum of ?80.000 per annum, estab
lished last year, to a charge cf S- M a month
p*r hydrant. It was estimated that in the
coming fiscal year there would be 4000
hydrants in all. Tlie revenue, therefore, de
rived from those hydrants would be $120,000
per anncn. His Honor, the Mayor, after an
elaborate and analytical computation of the
valuta of the j>ror>erties of the Soring: Valley
Water Works used In supplying the city with
Â¦water, of the probable <t >eratlns expenses and
the Uixss of the company, arrives at the same
conclusion as did the majority of the com
mittee, except that he would make the hydrant
rate *2 per hydrant instead of $2 50 per
hydrant, giving the company the sum of
f96.000 r>er annvm revenue from the hydrant
pen-Ice. The difference between the amount
that the majority of the committee proposed
to allow for hydrant service, to wit. $120,000.
and the amount which the Mayor proposes to
allowâ Srw.OOOâ is just $24,000.

tion of $20,000 in the revenue from hy
drants as originally fixed^ by the majority
report signed by Supervisors Comte and
Brandenstein of the WaUtr Committee.
The amended ordinance* suggested oy
the Mayor leaves the consumers' rates
the same as they are ' at \ present, and
fixes the hydrant rate at $2: which would
give the company $9S.O0O for hydrajits.
The rates are based on a valuation of
$Â£5,o00.000. and on an allowance of $430.
000 for operating expenses.
The ordinance was carried by the fol
lowing vote:

substitute that the ordinance proposed
by himself as the minority committee be
adopted. Connor argued that a 5 per, cent
cut in consumers' rates and allowing $1 75
for .each hydrant would . be , a : just' return
on the company's investment; which he
calculates at' $24,091,620, allowing interest
to the amount of $1^94.58103. He referred
to the estimated increase of- business and
to the fact that he allowed â¢ $450,000 lor
operating expenses, or $20,000 more than
the Mayor's suggestion. Â¦Â¦;â¢ Connor held
that to allow the company 5 -fier cent on
a . franchise valuation of; $2,250,000, which
he had eliminated, is unjust, as it merely
represents its good will, which has cost it

Braunhart : spoke at length in favor of
the Connor ordinance,- claiming that the

to the company. Brandenstein in, reply
