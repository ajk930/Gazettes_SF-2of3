FRESH DISASTER TO THE BRITISH ARMS
IN SOUTH AFRICA INFLICTED BY DELAREY
BRITISH OFFICERS WHO FIG
' URE IN THE NEWS OF BOER
VICTORY IN SOUTH AFRICA.
After General Methuen'a defeat at
Magersfontcln It was reported that he
had shown signs of breaking down al
most Immediately he took command of
Ills division, tmd General Wolseley, who
wns the commandcr-ln-chlef of the Brit
ish forces. Is said to have suggested to
the War Office, after, the battle of Bel
mont, that Methuen should be relieved.
General Methuen commanded the col
umn sent to relieve Klmberley In the lat
ter part of 1S00. and while on that ier
vlee. fought the Boers at Belmont, Oras
pan, the Modder River and Magersfon
teln. At tho buttle of Oraspan the Boers
were under command of General Delarey,
who. !Â¦ General Mothuen's captor now.
After these, engagements General Lord
Roberts was sent to South Africa, whero
he took personal command of the British
advance on Klmberley, and relieved
Klmberley February 16, 1000.
The feeling of depression in the lobbies
of the House of Commons over the news
' of the disaster in South Africa was very
marked. The service members of the
House expressed the opinion that it will
'necessitate'sending fresh troops to the
front, while the belief was widely ex
pressed that the Boers will not fall to
take advantage of General Methuen's
prominence to hold him as a hostage for
the safety of Commandant Kritzlnger
and other Boer leaders now in the hands
of the British. â¢- - '

Delarey. The news came like
a thunderbolt to London. The
extra editions of the evening papers giv
ing an account of the disaster were
eagerly bought up. Their readers hur
ried through the streets with anxious
faces and bitter remarks were passed on
the subject of the Government's declara
tion that the war in South Africa was
over. The news came too late to affect
business on the Stock Exchange, but ex
cited curb dealings quickly followed the
closing, in which South Africans slumped
heavily.
The news caused great excitement in the
mining market. Throgmorton street was
thronged with South African operators
early, inquiring for details of the British
defeat and watching the effect of the an
nouncement. Shares were offerM, freely
at nrst, but by 6 o'clock the/>icltement
had iiltuird and the curb tone hardened.

bowed repeatedly to the actors and 1 tho
audience. It was midnight when the royal
party left the theater and were escorted

"I wish to thank you for the kind re
ception I met with in the Union League.
Gentlemen, this is probably the last op
portunity I will have during my vlait to
the United States to speak in public, and
I am not sorry that this should be so.
What I am going to communicate to you
here I am saying before the world. There
has been absolutely no secret object in
view connected with my mission to your,
country. Should any of you read or hear
anything to the contrary, I authorize you
herewith to flatly contradict It. I was
told before leaving my home to open my
eyes as well as my ears, as wide as pos
sible; to speak as little as I could. In
this latter instance I am afraid my mis
sion is a failure. I saw many mure
things than many of you may be aware
of. I equally heard a great many things,
among others many kind words of indi
viduals as well as the shouts of welcome
of thousands of your countrymen. AVhat
I express in your presence I express in
the presence of your nationâ my heartfelt
thanks for the cordial reception and good
feeling I met with during my stay in your
country. It will be my duty to inform
the Emperor of thiÂ».fact. I am home
ward bound to-morrow. It would
be wrong of me to say I " am
sorry to so home, but at the. same
time I feel sorry to leave a country in.
which I have met with so much kindness
and hospitality. Let me add, gentlemen,
let us try and be friends."

J ONDON, March ft. â London was simply stunned last night by the news of a great disaster to the British arms in;South Africa.- When the evening papers first came out and the boys zvere shouting on the streets, "Great British dis
aster, twelve hundred troops captured, Lord Mcthucn zvounded and a prisoner," the people stood aghast and then- began buying up all the papers in sight. It xvas only too true, for tlie neivs of the disaster came from Lord Kitchener him
self. 'I he news zvas carried cast and zeest to workmen's clubs and to the hotels of the West End, and everywhere it created consternation without a glimmer of hope that the news might be exaggerated. There ivas some discontent that the first of
three dispatches which have been received at the War Office since Saturday morning, as stated by Secretary Brodrick in the House of Commons,' had been held back till this evening. Everywhere the greatest sympathy is expressed for
Lord Mcthucn that the greatest disaster to the British arms since the first three terrible.de feats at the beginning of the war had befallen him. It is one of the most galling and serious checks ivhich the British have sustained since the war
commenced. Â¦
GENERAL LORD METHUEN WOUNDED
AND TAKEN PRISONER BY THE BOERS
The San Francisco Call.The petition prays that the Northern
Securities Company, Its stockholders offi
cers^ etc.* be perpetually enjoined from
purchasing .voting, etc., any of The
shares of the capital stock of either the
Northern Pacific or Great Northern com
panles, and thar a. mandatory injunction
may issue requiring tho Northern Securi-
Asks for Injunction.
If the defendant, the Northern Securities I
Company, has not acquired a large majority of
the capital stock of the defendant, the Oreat
Northern Railway Company, it is because the j
Individual defendants named and their esso- ';
elates in the combination or , conspiracy as ;
charged in this petition, or some of them, sfnee |
it became apparent that the legality or their
device for the merger of the stock of ;
competing railroad lines through the instrumen- ;
tallty of a central or holding corporation would i
be assailed in the courts, have purposely with- I
held, or caused to be withheld, a large amount i
of the capital stock of said railway company
from transfer for the stock of the Northern Se
curities Company, and have purposely discour
aged and prevented the transfer and exchange
of such stock for the stock of the Northern Se
curities Company, all for. the purpose of con
cealing the real scope and object of the unlaw
ful combination or conspiracy, and of deceiving
and misleading the State and Federal authori
ties and of furnishing a. ground for the defense
that the Northern Securities Company does not
hold a clear majority of the stock of the Great
Northern Railway Company.
The Northern Securities Company was not or
ganized In good faith to purchase and pay for
the stocks of the Gre.t Northern and Northern
Pacific companies. It was organized solely to
Incorporate the pooling of the stocks of Jhe said
companies and to carry into effect. the unlawful
combination or conspiracy aforesaid. The
Northern Securities Company is a mere depos
itory, custodian, holder and trustee for thft
stocks of the Great Northern and Northern Pa
cific companies, and Its shares of stock are but
beneficial certificates issued against said rail
road stocks to designate the interest of the
holders in the pool. The Northern Securities
Company does Â¦ not have, and never had, any
capital sufficient to warrant such a stupendous
c peration. Its subscribed capital w*a but
fÂ»\Â°^^ d U * authorized capital, stock of
$400,000,000 la Just sufficient, when all Issued,
to represent and cover the exchange value of
substantially the entire stock of the Great
Northern and Northern Pacific Railway compa
nlefc Upon the basis and at the rate agreed
upon, which is about $122,000,000 in excess of
the combined capital stock of the two railway
companies taken at par.
If the Government fails to prevent the car
rying out of this combination or conspiracy, not
only will a virtual consolidation of two com
peting transcontinental lines with the practical
pooling of their earnings be effected, and a mo
nopoly of the Interstate and foreign commerce
formerly carried on by them as competitors be
created, and all effective competition between
such lines and carrying of Interstate and for
eign traffic be destroyed, but thereafter to ail
deeirln* to usÂ« It, an available method will be
presented whereby through the corporate
scheme or device aforesaid the act or Congress
of July, 2. 1890 may be circumvented andset
at naught, and all transcontinental lines. Indeed
the entire railway systems of the country may
be absorbed, merged and consolidated, thus
plac ng the public at the absolute mercy of the
holding corporation.
Capital Stock Withheld.
panles independently and In free competition,
one with the other, has been formed, and is in
operation, and the defendants are thereby at
tempting to monopolize, and have monopolized,
such interstate and foreign trade or commerce
to the great and irreparable damage of the peo
ple of the United States la derogation of their
common rights and In violation of the act of
Congress of July 2, 1S90, entlted "An act to
protect trade and commerce against unlawful
restraints and monopolies."
In further pursuance of the unlawful combi
nation or conspiracy aforesaid, and solely as an
instrumentality through which to effect the pur
poses thereof, on or about the 14th day of No
vember. 1901. the Northern Securities Company
.was organized by the election of a board ot
directors, and- the selection Â». of a president,
James J. HUi, . and other officers,-.' who. with
their associate stockholders of the Great North
ern Railway Company, assigned and transferred
to the Northern. Securities Company a large
amount of the capital stock of the Great North
ern Railway Company, constituting a,controll
ing interest therein., and, complainant believes,
a majority thereof upon the agreed basis of ex
change of $180 par value of the capital stock
of tho Northern Securities Company' for each
share of the capital stock of the Great North
ern Railway Company, and the defendant, J.
Plerpont Morgan, and his associate stockhold
ers of the Northern Pacific Railway Company,
assigned and transferrad to tho defendant, .the
Combination . or Conspiracy.
In this manner the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific Railway companies secured
control of the vast system of lines known as
the Burllneton system, about 8000 miles in
length. The attempt to turn over a controll
ing Interest ofr the Northern Pacific Railway
Company to the Great Northern having thus in
the veur 180(i beon defeated by a decision of
the Huoreme Court, the defendants, James J.
Hill and his associate stockholders of the
Great Northern owning or controlling a. ma
jority of Its stock, and the defendants. J.
Plerpont Morgan and his associates, owning
or controlling a majority of the stock of the
Northern Pacific Company â¢ Â» â¢ entered
into an unlawful combination or conspiracy to
effect a virtual consolidation of_the Northern
Pacific and Great Northern systems and to
place- restraint upon all competitive interstate
and foreign trade or commerce carried on by
them and to monopolize or attempt to monopo
lise the same and to suppress the competition
theretofore existing between aald railway sys
tems in tame interstate and foreign trade or
commerce, through the instrumentality and by
the means following, to wit: A holding: cor
poration, to be called the Northern Securities
company, was to be formed under the laws of
New Jersey, with a capital Btock or $400,000,
000, to which in exchange for its own capital
stock upon a certain baals and at a' certain
rate was to be turned over and transferred the
capital stock or a controllins interest in the
capital stock of each of the defendant railway
corr -panleH. .
In this manner the individual stockholders of
the *wo independent and competing railway
companies were to.be eliminated and a single
common stockholder, the Northern Securities
Company, was to be substituted; the interest
of the inatvliltiar stockholders in the property
and franchises of the two railway com
panies was to- terminate, being thus con*
verted Into an lntsreat In the property an*
franchises of the Northern Securities Com
pany. The individual stockholders of the
Northern Pacific Company i were no lonser to
hold an Interest in the property or draw their
dividends from the earnings of the Northern
Pacific system, and the individual stockholders
of the Great Northern Railway Company were
no longer to hold an Interest in the property or
draw their dividends from the earnings of the
Great Northern system, but having ceased to
be stockholders in the railway companies and
having become stockholders In the holding cor
poration, both were to draw their dividends
from' the earnings of both systems, collected
and distributed by the holding corporation. In
thU manner, t* making the stockholders of
each system jointly interested in both sys
tems and by. practically pooling the earnings
of both systems for the benefit of the former
stockholders of each and by vesting the selec
tion of the directors and officers or each sys
tem in a common body, to wit: the holding
corporation, with not only the power but the
duty to pursue a policy which would promote
the interests, not of one system at the expense
of the other, but of both at the expense of the
public, all Inducement for competition between
the two systems was to be removed, a/virtual
consolidation effected and a monopoly of the
Interstate and foreign commerce formerly car
ried on by the two systems as Independant
competitors established. ..

ON THE NEWLANDS BILL
Charge Is M?.de That the Land v Grant
Railways Are Behind the
Scheme.
WASHINGTON, March 10.âRepresen
tatives Ray of New York and Jenkins of
Wisconsin to-day filed a minority report
on the Newlands bill for the irrigation of
arid lands. The report characterizes the
measure as an "unfair, unwise and im
provident scheme," so vast and expen
sive that the ordinary mind is staggered
at its mere contemplation. The report
says that three of the -States and Terri
tories do not approve of the plan, and
"that the land grant railways are behind
this scheme and are the real bene
ficiaries." â¢ -
The bill Is also declared to be. uncon
stitutional on its provision for condemn

BOERS MAY RETALIATE.
LONDON, March 1Lâ The Daily Mail
has fears for that other British force
which Lord Methuen was on his way to
Join when overthrown by General â¢ De
larey\s army. While the opinion is gen
erally expressed that the Boers have re-
Epect for Lord Methuen and that he will
be well taken care of while Delarey's
prisoner, still there is a great amount of
anxiety as to his ultimate fate for this
reason: Commandant Kritzinger is in thÂ«
hands of the British, and if he is shot, as
may. be the penalty he may have to suf
fer, what will Lord Methuen's fate be
then?
The Daily News gives prominence to the
fact that 500 yeomanry were chased by
the Boers for four miles, and makes the
most of the humiliation it will give to
Englishmen to read of it but this is the
only paper among the Radical organs
here which shows any venom toward th a
British conduct of the war.
All are waiting for further details as
showirg how Lord Methuen's force was
trapped in so unaccountable a fashion
The thing would seem clear that the
BoeriB were not in an overwhelming force;
they were almost man for man with the
British.
SQUADRON OF WARSHIPS
MAY VISIT RIO JANEIRO
Germany to Enforce the Collection ot
a Debt Incurred by a Brazilian
Province. I
BERLIN. March 10.â The Foreign Office
has been appealed to and it Is thought
likely that the German squadron of war
ships may visit the harbor of Rio Janeiro
before leaving South American waters
to enforce the collection of another Ger
man railway debt incurred by the Bra
zilian province of Minas Geraes.
The provincial authorities have placed
the Minas Geraes railways, owned by
German capitalists, in the hands of a re
ceiver, and have canceled the German
concession, because the officers declined
to operate the line pending the payment

ST. PAUL, Minn., March lO.-By
direction of the Attorney General
of the United States a. bill was
filed here to-day in the Circuit
Court of the United States for the
District of Minnesota, in the case of
the United Slates, complainant, against
the Northern Securities Company, the
Great Northern Railway Company,
the Northern Pacific Railway Company
and others, defendants, to test the legali
ty of the alleged combination or merger
of the two roads and others named In
the bill. The action is brought under the
act of July 2, 1S90, known as the Sher
man anti-trust law.
After reciting the fact that the North
ern Securities Company is a corporation
organized under the laws of the Stato
of New Jersey, that the Oreat Northern
was organized under the laws of the
Htate of Minnesota and the North
ern Pacific . under the laws of th-j
State of Wisconsin; and that the two last
named companies are common carriers,
doing an interstate business, and' that
these companies at and prior to the do
ing of the acts complained of owned and
operated two separate, independent,
parallel and competing lines of railway,
aggregating over 5566 miles in length, tha
petition goes on to say that they "were
.the only transcontinental lines of rail
ways extending across the northern tier
of States west of the Great Lakes.-from
the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River
to the Pacific Ocean, and were then en
gaged in active .competition with. one. an-,
other for freight and passenger traffic
among the several States of tne United
States, and between such States and for
eign countries, each system connecting
at its eastern terminus, not only with
lines of railway, but with lake and river
steamers to other States and to .foreign
countries, and at its western terminals
with seagoing vessels to other States,
Territories and possessions of the United
States and to foreign countries."
A Virtual Consolidation.
That nrlor to the year 1893 the Northern
Pacific system was owned and operated by the
Northern Pacific Railway Company, a corpo
ration organized unier certain acts of Con
greE&; that during that year the company be
came insolvent and was placid In the hands
of a receiver; While in this, condition, awak
ing foreclosure and sale, an arrangement was
entered into between a majority of the bond
holders of the Northern . Pacific Railway Com
pany and th,e Great Northern Railway Com
pany for a virtual consolidation of tne two and
placing the control of the Northern Pacific sys
tem In the hands of the Great Northern. This
arrangement contemplated the foreclosure ot
the Northern Pacific to a committee of bond
holders Â¦ who should, organize a new corpora
tion to be known as the Northern Pacific Rail
way Company. One-half of the capital mock
of the new company was turned over to tho
Great Northern Company, which In Ulrn was
,to guarantee the bonds of the Northern Pacific
Railway Company. â¢ â¢ . .
The earrylne out of this arrangement was
defeated by the decision of . the United States
Supreme Court in the case of Pearsallagainsi
the Great Northern Railway Company, which
was decided March 30, 1890, in which It wÂ«Â«t
held that the practical effect would be the
consolidation of two parallel and competing
lines of railway and the giving to the defend
ant, the Great Northern Railway Company, a
monopoly of all traffic in the northern half of
the State of Minnesota, as well as o'f all trans
continental traffic north of the lines of the
Union Pacific, -to the detriment of the public

It is believed that as a last condition
prior to his acceptance of- Germany's re

easily to these requests while a German

Colombia, Costa Rica and Nicaragua, the

the only vessel to remain at La Guayra

"I find Methuen has a fractured thigh,
but he is reported to be doiAg well."
In another- message Lord Kitchener
says the wounded will be brought In to
the railroad to-day, and adds:
"I hope the reinforcements now arriv
ing will rectify the situation In this area
without disturbing operations elsewhere."
It is supposed that Lord Methuen was
marching- with the intention to avenge
the capture of the Von Donop convoy.
The newspaper correspondents in South
Africa have not yet been allowed to de
scribe the affair. The only additional de-;
tails available are contained in a further
cispatch from Lord Kitchener, which
Brodridc, the Secretary for War, read
just as Parliament was adjourning. This
dispatch shows that the first confusion
was caused by native Boers with leci
horses, who galloped through the mule
convoy as the latter was endeavoring, by
Lord Methuen's directions, to close on
me ox convoy. The disorder among the
mules communicated itself to the mount
ed troops, and the Boers, dressed in
khaki and riding alongside the wagons,
frustrated all the attempts of the British
officers to rally their forces. Great con
fusion ensued among this portion of the
mounted troops, they and the mule
Â¦wagons galloping three miles beyond the
ox wagons, where they were cut off.
Sections of the Fourth and Thirty
eighth batteries of artillery fought with
gTeat gallantry, and 600 men composed of
the Northumberland Fusileers and the
Lancashires showed conspicuous courage
in protecting the wagons and refusing to
surrender until resistance was useless.
* The force under General Delarey was
almost entirely dressed in British uni
forms. This made it impossible to dis
tinguish between their own men and the
enemy when the mounted troops were
driven in on them. The enemy numbered
1500 men. They had one fifteen-pounder
and a pompon.
Delarey, Cellars. Kemp, Verasso. Tromp
and other commandants were present.
General Methuen was seen by an agent
of the intelligence department. He was be
ing well cared for in his own wacon.
In a private telegram just received here
Lord Kitchener adds: â¢ -
LONDON, March 11.â Delarey, who has
proved himself the most able of the Boer
generals, has within a fortnight gained a
second decisive victory. His first victory
v/as the capture of the Von Donop convoy,'
Â¦when the British casualties in killed,
wounded and prisoners totaled â¬32, and he
has now added to his laurels by the cap
ture, for the first time during the cam
paign, of a prominent British general and
by Inflicting what Is generally " admitted
to be one of the worst reverses the Brit
ish have suffered throughout the whole
war.
PELABEY'S SECOND VICTORY.
His handling of the troops aroused the
most violent criticism, which was only
stilled by the relief of Kimberlev, when
the question of his health and" ability
seemed to be dropped. Since that time
General Methuen has rendered efficient
service and several notable successes over
the Boers stand to his credit.
but his advice was not heeded. General
Methuen sent a number of remarkable
messages to the War Office, one of which
contained Just three words: "Darkness

Those who know the Indian say that
he is an extremely dangerous man. Ten
years ago he was sentenced to prison for
six years for shooting a man, and if more
evidence could have been obtained it is
probable that he would have been hanged.
At Higgins' camp, Card aroused the
men, who took a small boat and started
with him on the trip to Lund, a distance
of thirty miles, shortly before midnight.
From there the wounded man was
brought to Vancouver.
Card was shot late In the afternoon, and
what his sufferings were in paddling to
Higgina' camp that night may never be
known, as he is not yet out of danger.
Bleeding constantly, Card never faltered
in his determination to reach Higgins'
camp, and late at night he arrived there
utterly exhausted. He was so weak- from
loss of blood that had he been forced to
paddle another half-mile he could not
have survived.
John Card is the man who lies wounded
in the hospital. He -and a man named
Hussey have been engaged in logging on
Toba Inlet. The Indian was in their em
ploy. Last Friday afternoon Johnnie
Tackum returned home from Read Island
with some boom chains. When some miles
from Card's and Hussey's camp, the In
dian shot at a. man named Gallagher, also
a logger, and the bullet took effect In his
arm. On reaching the camp the Indian
Was seen by Card, who was in a canoe a
short distance off shore, to beat his squaW
on the head with a paddle till she fell
to the ground dead. After that he chased
Hussey into the woods and Card heard
several shots tired. Hussey was unarmed.
The Indian then came running back,
shouting that he had killed Hussey.
Card commenced to reconnoiter. As he
was approaching the shore the Indian
came out from behind a tree and shot at
him. The bullet tirst struck the water
and glanced, entering the canoe and strik
ing 4 Card on the left leg, just above the
knee and penetrating 1 to the srain. Not
daring to land. Card bound up his wound
with a handkerchief, turned the canoe
about and commenced to paddle for Hig
gins' lumber camp, a distance of fourteen
miles down the inlet.

NORTHERN REDS
ON THE WARPATH
Indians Attack Hudson
Bay Company Post
at Fort George.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Marc^- 10.â The
tawny redskins who huntxamong the
mountains around Fort George, 200 miles
north of. the Cariboo gold district, havo
gone on the warpath against the handful
of whites around the Hudson Bay sta
tion. The first news of the trouble came
to-day in a dispatch to the Attorney Gen
eral in Victoria from E. L. Kepner. Hud
son Bay agent at Fort George, who had
journeyed out to the. telegraph, station at
Quesnelle to obtain military assistance.
The dispatch explained that the Indians
had been very troublesome all winter, and
two weeks ago they made an open attack
on the post. The factor and his assistant,
named Cook, had been warned, and. hav
ing barricaded themselves, kept the Indi
ans away. No one was killed, although
shots were fired by the white men and
their helpers over the heads of the na
tives to scare them away.
The Indians have had a hard winter,
and refused to furnish pelts in trade. One
Indian, bolder than the others, got Inside
and threatened to kill Kepner with an
ax if he did not throw open the store to
them. Finally Kepner got them quieted,
and, leaving his in charge,
started out for help.
The superintendent of the provincial po
lice will personally lead a punitive expe
dition, and special constables are being
sworn in to start with him at once. They
will arrest the leaders of the Indians and
arrange to feed the starving families.

Thousands of Families Have Heard
the Joyful News That
PAINE'S
Celery Compound
Makes Sick People Well and

The people who have not heard in
some way of Paine's Celery Compound
and its wonderful triumphs over the dis-
eases and ailments of life cannot be
counted as newspaper or magazine
readers, nor are they among those who
are in touch with the medical progres-
siveness of the times.
A house-to-bouse canvass (if that
were possible) of families where Paine's
Celery Compound is being used during
these early spring days would disclose
an overwhelming amount of evidence
regarding the implicit confidence that is
placed in this greatest of all spring
medicines. It would show the enor-
mous number of people who are being
cured of some form of- nervousness,
sleeplessness, dyspepsia, indigestion,
neuralgia, rheumatism, headaches, kid-
ney and liver diseases.
Now is the time when Paine's Celery
Compound can show astonishing and
happy results to the sick. Now that
spring is with us, giving a promise of
fine weather and- new beauties, it should
lend encouragement to the work Of get-
ting well and strong.
The use of Paine's Celery Compound
for a few weeks will truly astonish*
every debilitated, weak and sickly man
and woman. The change from a muddy
and sallow complexion to a fresh,
healthy color, with bright, sparkling
eyes, unclouded brain, the enjoyment
of refreshing sleep, clear, fresh blood
coursing through the body, will be the
sure reward of every user of Paine's
Celery Compound. Accept no substi-

To some of his other Congressional vis
itors, who talked with him to-day regard
ing Cuban reciprocity, the President said
there was difficulty in determining Just
what promises or representations were
made to the Cuban delegates when they
visited Washington last summer, previ
ous to the adoption of the Platt amend
ment as a part of the Cuban- constitution.
There was no record of any promise, but
the understanding seemed to be that re
ciprocal arrangements were to be made
with Cuba of a nature whictu would give
the island's products an advantage in the
markets of the United States. In the
course of the discussion to-day, it ia un
derstood. Senator Allison remarked that
more importance had Deen given to the
subject than was warranted; that " the
proposed 20 per cent reduction to be
granted to Cuba would not be of material
advantage to the planters of the island,
nor would such a reduction of duty on
Cuban sugar affect in any material way
the beet sugar Interests of this country.
The President expressed a desire to â¢ se
cure harmony and some of the Senator3
who saw him said they believed also that
was the desire of the Republicans in
Congress, some of whom thought it was
quite important that the present strained
relations should not continue.

that the Cuban reciprocity situation wa3

message was at present in contempla

maintain the position for reciprocity he
had taken in his annual message. Payne's
associates in the contest expressed the
belief that the reciprocity plan would pre
vail in some form. Ii* tnis connection
there were intimations that the Senate
might take up the question by adding a
Cuban amendment to the war revenue or
some other pending bill.

shows that . there is no such intention,

Service Commission has adopted a report
exonerating - Postmaster Roberts o r
Brooklyn from any willful violations of
the civil service law and rules, as charged
by the National Civil Service Reform
League. The report was made by Com
missioner Foulke, who investigated the
charges.

VICTOR, Colo., March 10.â Several
property-owners in this city and' Cripple
Creek to-day received letters signed
â¢â¢Committee," warning them not to lease
buildings to buyers of stolen ore. As the
notices came through the mails, it is
quite probable that the matter will be
turned over to the postal authorities and
efforts made to run down the author or
authors of the letters.
Frank M. Woods of the Gold Coin mine,
a member of the executive committee of
the Mine-owners' Association, said to-day
that he did not know who sent the no
tices. He expressed' surprise to learn that
Buch warnings had been sent. - Â¦

The engine and eight coaches were worth at
least J400.000, to say nothing of the baggage
and other property on the train which was lost in
the fire. A small amount of the baggage -was
saved out of the wreckâ how, no oÂ»e knows.
The baggage car. was split in two and it is
possible that a good deal of the baggage was
thrown from the car, as It is hardly likely
that any one attempted to throw out any bag
page. As to the United States mail, not a
Piece of that was saved that I know of. The
mall car was probably the first to catch fire
and the mail was entirely destroyed.
Suspicious tracks were found some dis
tance from the scene of the wreck and
Manager Van Vleck has sent a trained
trailer to the scene with the hope that
something may result. Many hold to the
idea that an obstruction was placed upon
thf; track for the purpose of robbery, and
the authorities are determined to probe
the matter from every standpoint.
A dispatch from Alpine, received this
afternoon, says the charred bones â¢ of
three bodies were found under the ruins
cf the chair cgr and a lot of bones under
the smoker. Coroner J. M. Carnes esti
mates that the latter were the remains
of about eight persons. He based his
estimate on the number of femurs.
So izx -we have not been able to determine
the immediate cause of the wreck, as the cars
â¢were piled up en the engine at the time I left
the wreck, and we could not tell if some part
of the engine had given away or not. It Is
more than probable that such was the cause
of the wreck, as the majority of the passenger*
t ay the train was not running: at an extra high
rate of epeed. The point of the road where the
train left the track is a nine-degree curve.
There are two curves of the track as It winds
around the hills and the wreck occurred about
half way between the extreme points of the two
curves.
The train did not go oft on the inside of the
track, as was reported, but went off on the
outeide. The engine went forty-seven feet
from the track and most of the cars piled
in an indiscriminate mass around it. Whatever
was the cause of the wreck it came suddenly
and without warning, as the engine men had
no time to Jump, but were caught under the
cab and teld fast.
EL PASO, Texas, March 10.â W.~ R.
Martin, division superintendent for the
Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio
branch of the Southern Pacific, left here
shortly after the news of the wreck at
Maxon reached here. He returned to the
city to-day and made the following state
ment in reference to the disaster:

WASHINGTON, March 10.â The United
States Supreme Court to-day decided the
Illinois anti-trust statute to "be unconsti
tutional because of the provision of the
law exempting agricultural products and
livestock from the operations of the lawJ
The decision was rendered in the case of
Thomas Connelly and others against the
Union Sewer Pipe Company of Ohio and
was delivered by Justice Harlan.
The case grew out of the sale of pipe by
the pipe company to Connelly and others,
who, after securing it, declined to make
payment on the ground that the ! pipe
company is an illegal combination for tne
restraint of trade under the common law,
because it combines a > number of local
pipe manufacturing concerns ; that' it is
a combination in violation of the Sher
man anti-trust law, and, further, a viola
tion of the anti-trust law of the State of
Illinois. The first two contentions received
very slight consideration, the court hold
ing that even if the allegations were true
they could not justly prevent the corpora
tion selling its property. The opinion,
therefore, was based on the third plea,
which Justice- Harlan said would be valid
if the State law could be held to be valid,
as there could be no doubt of the purport
of the act. Under that law the corporation
could be dissolved if the law is valid. He
quoted the law at length, laying especial
stress upon the ninth section, exempting
farm products, concluding that this pro
vision is antagonistic to the provisions of
the constitution granting equal protection
to all under the law. He also held that
the exempting clause is. so interwoven
with other portions of the statute as to
render it impossible to eliminate it from
the law as an entirety, and therefore held
that the entire law must^ be held to be
invalid. . -

Fife's trial for the murder of Frank W.
Richardson, his former associate in busi
ness here, began to-day. Fife has lost
much of the calmness that, he displayed
when he arrived from North Yakima,
Wash., where he was arrested two months
ago. He sleeps but little and when he
entered the courtroom to-day he looked
worried." Several stories of new and start
ling developments that are to come out
at the trial have. been circulated, one of
them being to the effect that Fife's law
yers will implicate "another man in the
murder. Mrs: Richardson, the widow,
who was acquitted recently of complicity
'in the murder, will appear as a witness
for the defense, while her two young sons
will be used as witnesses for the State.
"Fife's" -attorney Â¦.will,'- it is 'said;' try to
prove an . alibi for him.
-. - Prosecuting Attorney Booher, in making
.the opening statement, ;Â¦ said th6 State
.would show that Fife had, in a. St. r Joseph
saloon, .where he displayed a revolver,
made 'a threat that he would f kill Rich
ardson, and that after .the. tragedy he had
confessed to a woman: in. that city that
he , had committed the murder. \ It would
also be shown, he asserted, that Fife was
seen standing in the middle of the street
on the night of the murder, looking in
the direction of : the Richardson home.

The stewards of the California Jockey
Club have restored Arthur Heinrichs to
good standing on the turf. Some six
years ago, when a rider of rare promise,
Heinrichs became a member of the Little
Pete clique, and when the big upheaval
came was indefinitely suspended. Jockeys
Jerry Chorn and Chevalier, along with
Trainer Dow Williams, were ruled off the
turf for life. Several others were just a3

territory in sight had a hard fall just
after passing the wire, besides getting
beaten. Not only that, but Troxler on
Dunblane, following -right at his heels,
was unable to miss the spill, going down
in a .heap also. Fortunately the spot
where the "horses tumbled was muddy,
and beyond giving the occupants of the
stand a scare the accident was attended
by no serious results. Impromptu, the
eventual winner, of the race, was at one
time so far in the rear that his chances
seemed hopeless. However, Ransch per
severed, and in a hard drive, downed
Dorian a neck. At the head of the stretch
Troxler, astride of Dunblane, the favor

the inside of Dorian, which maneuver
cost; him considerable ground.
Many of the starters in tbe different

adverse circumstances the favorites - be

O'Connor had the mount on El Rey in
the introductory Futurity course sprint,
and by a persevering ride got the decision

ljt. de Vecchl was seen last evening and
he Etated that. the Misses 'Friedlander
were.. In a precarious condition.. . Neither
of the sisters had been able to partake of
any food for the 1 last month /and they
were in a very feeble state. Dr. de Vec
chi said that he <?6uld not state whether
the r-atient3 would succumb or recoverâ
he could only hope for the best.
tr. Cary - Friedlander, secretary - of the
Produce Exchange, is a brother .of the
young ladies. Both sisters have a host
of friends and the .unfortunate "patients
are dally recipients - of many anxious in
quiries as to their condition.
A little more than a month ago Miss
May Friedlander, the younger sister, suf
fered a slight burn on the foot, which de
veloped into a^ wound. She did not 'pay
any particular attention to it, but applied
slmpie home remedies.
The wound refused to heal and when
the family physician. Dr. F. de Vecchl,
was called in he found that the young
laay was sutfering with erysipelas. .
Her condition grew worse and she was
removed to the Lane Hospital. A few
days after her removal " her sister, Miss
Fannie Friedlander,' was taken ill and
Dr. de Vecchi was hastily summoned.
He found that Miss Fannie had contract
ed erysipelas from her. sister through a
slight cut in her finger and it was neces
sary to also remove ner. to the hospital.
The two elsters are in a dangerous con
dition. ?
Society, of which they were formerly
prominent members, .applauded the heroic
work of the Misses Friecuander and their
business, venture had every prospect of
being most successful. .
When family misfortune recently over
took the two young .ladies, they bravely
determined to win their way in the world
and decided to start* a catering establish
ment.

Jimmy Britt, the lightweight boxer, who
is rapidly forging his way to the top of
his class, was last night presented with
a beautiful loving cup by his friends. The
presentation was made at a banquet ten
dered him at a downtown rotisserle. It
v. - as a complete surprise to Jimmy and
he was greatly touched by the kindness
of his friends.
Britt was inveigled to the restaurant by
Charles Reno, his sparring partner. He
was told that a dinner for four had been
arranged. Unsuspectingly he entered the
dining-room and was greeted with vocif
erous cheers by the guests. On the cup
were engraved the words wttered by
Caesar: "Vent Vidi, Vici"â "I came, I
saw, I conquered." On the other side were
the words: "To Jimmy, with compli
ments of the bunch."
In' expressing his heartfelt appreciation
for the gift. Britt took occasion to tell
his triends of. his reasons for entering the
ranks of the professional pugulists. He
said that as an amateur he had defeated
every roan pitted against him and no one

his talents in the professional class and
so far had been successful. He assured
his friends he would strive to retain their

battle with a negro, but would always be
ready to meet the white man who con
quered a member of the colored race.

JIMMY BBITT IS GIVEN . >' ;
A HANDSOME LOVING CUP
Moody is comparatively a young man,:
being in his forty-ninth year. . He is' a :
lawyer by profession, being a graduate:
of Phillips Academy, Andover, Mass.,
and Harvard University. ; He had been
District Attorney for the eastern district
of Massachusetts, and has served in the
Fifty-fourth, Fifty-fifth, Fifty-sixth and
Fifty-seventh Congresses, being Â¦â¢ elected
as a Republican. He was born in New-'
bury, Mass., but now resides at Haver
hill. Moody expects to assume charge of
his new office May 1.
Representative . Moody of Massachus
etts began to rise to prominence during
his first term in the House, when Speaker
Reed selected him frequently to preside
over the committee of the whole, and pre
dicted for him a brilliant legislative ca
reer. -As a member of the Appropriations
Committee he has since led several fights
In the House, notably in connection with
the contest between . the navy and
Geodetic Survey over the Jurisdiction of
deep water surveys. He secured the adop
tion of a resolution on an appropriation
bill raising Dewey to the rank of admiral.
Brilliant Public Career of Moody. ;
Moody's selection was the outepme of
an 1 interesting contest. There were no
less than halt a dozen aspirants, but the
struggle finally narrowed down, to the
two Representatives in Congress, Foss of
Illinois, chairman of the Naval Commit
tee of the House, who had the energetic
support of his Western colleagues, and
Moody, for whom -Senator Lodge made
the winning fight. It i was for a time in
doubt whether Moody would not be placed
in some important foreign mission rather
thanin the Navy Department, but he pre
ferred to stay at home. -. . t 'Â¦Â¦< >-
CONGRESSMAN WHO WILL

TWO SISTERS
ARE STRICKEN
... â â â¢ >-
White House,
WASHINGTON. March 10. 1902.
My Dear Mr. Secretary: It is with very
Fincere regret that I accept your resignation, I
shall always count It a privilege, not only to
have served with you during- the last six
months but i to have served under you at the
outset of President McKinley's administration.
I have seen you In both relation, and It has
never been my good fortune to be associated
with any public man more single-minded In his
devotion to the public interest. Our relations
have not been merely official, but also those of.
personal friendship. .
May all the good fortune you richly deserve
attend you wherever you go. Sincerely yours,
. THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
To the Hon. John D. Long, Secretary of the
Navy.
submitted his resignation in
a felicitous letter, it being accepted in
one equally felicitous by the President.
The change was made complete by the
Eelection of Representative William, Hen
ry Moody of the Sixth Congressional Dis
trict of Massachusetts as Long's suc
cessor in the Navy Department. This
change has been expected for a long
time. Long had intended to retire at the
beginning of the late President McKin
ley's second term, but he consented to
remain until certain lines of policy In
which he was involved were more satis
factorily arranged. Then when President
Roosevelt succeeded, though anxious to
return to private lifeâ for Secretary Long
will never again enter public lifeâ a
strong feeling of loyalty toward Roose
velt indbced the Secretary to defer his
retirement until it was convenient for the
President to make a ' change. Recently
Long has been in Massachusetts making
arrangements with his old legar connec
tions to re-enter the practice of law, and
be has had his house at Hingham put in
order for his occupation. When Long
entered the Cabinet originally he was' an
active member of the firm of Hemingway
Ac Long, a well known legal firm of Bos
ton. He always has maintained a silent
connection with the concern, and will
again become an active partner. The cor
respondence exchanged to-day Is as fol
lows:
President Accepts the Resignation.
' " Navy Department, .
WASHINGTON. March 10, 1902. ,
My Dear Mr. President: Will you accept this
as my resignation of the Secretaryship of the
Navy â to take effect on the first day of May
or sooner, of course. If you shall at any time
so wish? It has been to me a delightful serv
ice. I leave the official circle of your Cabinet,
in which my association with you and its mem
bers has been bo happy, with high appreciation
of your administration and with most cordial
good wishes for Its success and for you person
ally. Very truly yours, jOHN D. LONG.
To the President. " . .
WASHINGTON. March 10.â The
third change In the Cabinet
of President Roosevelt oc
curred when Secretary Long
Earl G. Westmore, alias F. Wilson, the
ex- convict who pleaded guilty in Judge
r?unne's court Friday to a charge of as
sault to murder and a. charge of assault
vith a deadly weapon, appeared for sen
tence yesterday. The Judge sentenced
him to eight years in San Quentin on the
ft!?t mentioned charge and two years^on
th<> second. He had a prior conviction
OSStast him for burglary in the first de-
KTce in ICings County.
On Christmas night "Westmore shot and
seriously wounded Hans Alverson. night

ond street, because he was ordered out.
for being drunk and raising a disturb
ance, and also shot and seriouslv wound
ed Charles Tenne, a bartender, who hap
pitjed to be. passing the hotel at the time
on his way home. Tenne's life was
d:Â«=j>aJred of for some time, but now he is
able to be around on crutches.
constrained to believe that his plea of guilt}*
could only have beta interposed with the hope
that an individual would be less likely to as
sume the responsibility of declaring that h*
ehould . forfeit hie life than would twelve men
act ing collectively. If a mere plea of guilty'
{'ould produce euch a. result, the most diabolical
murderers â and Â¦ the evidence shows this de
fendant to be such â could always go unwhipt
of justice and es=aj>e their merited punish
ment for crime by merely confessing their guilt
when arraigned at the bar of justice, trusting
to the weakness of an individual as compared
with a collective body.' I cannot, in the light
of my duty, ae I eee It. permit myself to set
â¢?uch a precedent, much as I would like to be
relieved of the responsibility of taking a hu
man life and sending the soul of a brother man
before our Creator. Should I do so, I could
never again expect juries to do their duty.
The law contemplates that all murders, such
s.s the one of which this defendant confesses
himself guilty, should be punished ; bv death,
and should I determine otherwise in this case
It could only be through cowardice, and in ;
vears to come I should always feel myself |
censurable. ' j
Chew Lan Ons. the Chinese who plead
ed fiuilty to murder before Judge Cook
Thursday, was sentenced yesterday to be
hanged, and this morning the Judge will
Mgi.' the death warrant, fixing the date
of txecutlon at San tjuentln. The defend
ant Bhot.and killed Gin Do Hing. a., boy
15 years of age, in the basement at 82*
Washington street on the , morning ot.
July Zi, alleging that, he did I so out of
revenge because the boy's father, and
uncle had robbed him of his inheritance
in China. t / â¢ â¢
The , J udge was extremely nervous and
<ould not help showing it while deliver
ing judgment. After, dwelling upon the
le.iponsioiiity placed upon him by sec
tion XUl of the Penal Code, he said he
had caret ully read and reread the evi
dence in the case, taken. at the prelimin
ary examination, and haxi found beyond
the shadow of a doubt that the crime
wes a murder of the first degree. From
tli/K evidence submitted there could be no
question but that it was a, cold-blooded,
aellberale and cowardly assassination,
planned deliberately and with premedlta
lion â¢ and malice aforethought. He had
therefore no hesitation in finding the de
gree of the crime to be murder of the
nrst degree. ' .
The Judge continued:
In the light of- the evidence before me I axa
Letitia. A. Little was divorced from T.
R. l.ittle by Judge Graham yesterday for
Â£ r^rÂ£i They we re married at Oakland
but little more than a month ago.
f^ e }^ n i/-A D^y ls^ was granted a divorce
from C. H. A. Davis. Mrs. Davis charged
her husband with neglect. â¢-.
Divorces were also granted yesterday to
Claudette H. Mangel from Fred .W. Man-
S? Â«? r Â£ ese , rtIon and J- "M. F. Davis from
Nettie Davis for desertion. -
He charges that two months after his
marriage she cut him with a knife, and
that in September and October, 1900, she
threw dishes at him. In November. 19U0
he^ alleges, she again / cut him with a
knife and struck him on the head with
a bottle, compelling him to keep to his
bed for several days. She used a broom,
alleges Doerr, in; September, 1901, arid iii
the following month again assaulted him
: with a knife. In , November of last year,
the plaintiff charges,- she chased- him
-with a. cleaver. -.Â¦Â¦,. .. .Â» . .. â
Suits for divorce were also filed yester
day by B. M. Shone against Sarah Shone
for desertion, and Juliette Roberts
against Eugene Roberts for failure td
provide.
Says She Cut Him.
Louis Doerr is very much afraid of his
wife, Virginia Doerr, to whom he was
married in January, 18S8, according to the
complaint for divorce he filed yesterday.
He charges her with extreme cruelty and
alleges that her actions have caused him
great anguish and fear for Ms life.
Annie Goldberg is: suing tor the annul
ment of her marriage to G. Goldberg, a
postofflce employe. Mrs. Goldberg charges
that on July 8 of last year she met Gold
berg ,and promised to marry him. He
told her, she alleges, that he was receiv
ing a good salary and would provide her
with a nice home. They were married
the next day. ..
"He then told me," alleges Mrs. Gold
berg, "that he never intended living with
me,' and said he was only fooling when he
promised to provide a home for me. Since
the day after, our marriage he has done
nothing for me." -â¢ -
"While I .'was living'"' with my sister,"
said the plaintiff, "he- called me up -on
the ' telephone and when li answered all
he said was,. 'I'll blow youc brains out.'
â¢Tie did not pay for the
ring; he gav& me, 'and I- was a
great deal by collectors who came to my

Finally I was compelled to give the Jewel
up." \ 'Â¦>. â¢â¢.'?Â¦>; â¢
The Johnstons were married in 1 Febru
ary, 1901. They lived together only one
month, when, Mrs. Johnston says, she
was compelled to leave him, owing to his
cruel treatment. . .
Her little daughter, Alice, corroborated
her testimony: She -testified that her
father came home late, drunk, and that
she saw! 'Him strike her 'mother. .. : '
Jeanette L. Johnston was granted a di
vorce from T. W.* Johnston .by- Judge
Sloss yesterday for extreme cruelty., Mrs.
Johnston, ; who is \ a "rery- pretty, refined
little "woman, testified yesterday that her
husband's cruel actions were varied. She
said he often^ grabbed her.by'the arms,
twisted. them almost out of the sockets,
and 'while holding her in that position
cursed, and.. abused.her.' â¢. " Â¦-

Lean was' the-, plaintiff in the '.suit. He'
charged his wife with habitual intemper
ance and cruelty. He did. not put in an
appearance; in the- courtroom yesterday.
Mrs.. Lean and, her daughter, 10 years of
age, were there, and their | evidence was
enough to support Mrs. Lean's cross-com
plaint, in "which she charged her husband
with cruelty., Mrs.. Lean testified that her
husband Â¦ never came " home until' 3 a. : m. ,
and that when he* did come home he was
usually under Jthe influence "of liquor. She
also said that orj many occasions he had
cruelly beaten her. . . - . '

Church.
Profanes Sanctuary of St.
Patrick's Catholic
Ereaks Door With Crowbar
and Damages Images
and Crucifix.
St. Patrick's Catholic Church, on Mis
sion street, was entered last Friday night
by some vandal who vras evidently bent
on the wanton destruction of the sacred
objects in the sanctuary and the desecra
tion of the altar. The miscreant gained
entrance to the sacred edifice through a
door In the rear of the church opening
on Jessie street. The door had r.ot been
used in many years and was padlocked.
The vandal succeeded- in breaking the
padlock with a crowbar and an ax ami
in doing so cut and splintered the door.
Owing to the lateness of the hour there
was no one attracted by the loud noiso
that the marauder must have made.
After having secured an entrance he pro
ceeded to destroy whatever he could con
veniently lay his hands on. He took the
lamp, which the ritual of the Catholic
church requires to be kept continually
burning, and poured the oil over the mis
sal, the altar cloths and the sanctuary.
After emptying the contents of the thur
ible on the lloor he ground the . incense
into the caroet with his heels.
With hia crowbar he broke off the wing3
of the marble angel3 which adorned the
sanctuary and damaged their heads and
trunks. The large crucifix in the sanc
tuary was the next to experience the van
dal's fury. He broke both arms of the
Christus and damaged the body of the
sacred image with blow3 from his crow
bar.
Father Cummins, pastor of 8t. Pat
rick's Church, said yesterday that* he was
very thankful that the vandal did not
break open the tabernacle and disturb
the golden chalices containing the euchar
istic particles. Father Cummins reported
the outrage to the police and. two detect
ives were detailed to search for the mis
creant. Owing to the fact that the man
took nothing of value from the church
the police and Father Cummins are of
the opinion that the outrage was perpe
trated by a demented person or by a re
ligious bigot rather than by a therf.

Captain L. P. Harvey of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company has returned from Wash
ington D. C where he has been attending the
Grand Harbor of the Masters' and Pilots' As

now been divided Into four districts â Atlantic,
Lakes, Gulf and Pacific. Captain Harvey

The Toyo Klsen Kalsha's steamship America
jkaru arrived yesterday from the Orient. In
spite of heavy weather from port to port the Ja
panese liner lived up to her schedule throughout
the voyage. She is twenty-five days from Hong
kong and six days seven hours from Honolulu.
Among the passengers was F. O. Guirschmann,
the chief engineer in charge of the construction
of the Trans-Siberian Railroad. J. H. Ankrom,
a prominent Manila merchant, was a passenger
and D. A. Socci. the Barnum of the Philippines,
came across the Pacific ln search of novelties.
America Maru Arrives.
The schooner Gotama. -which left here Sun
day for Coos Bay. returned yesterday for re
pairs She struck heavy weather soon after
leaving and when off the Farallones sprung a
leak which necessitated her return to port.
She had three feet of water ki her hold when
ehe anchored off llelggs wharf.
The British seallne; schooner Vera also came
Into port in distress. .She was out on her regu
lar sealing: cruise and on March 5 ran Into
some heavy weather, from which she emerged
badly shaken up and minus her boats. She came
here for two new boats and while ln port will
have her rigging thoroughly overhauled. Her
catch up to date amounts to about thirty seals.
Other Vessels in Distress.
As the mast snapped the big ship right
ed her&elf and all hands took a rest. A
course was then laid for San Francisco,
which was reached yesterday afternoon.
The Deveron will discharge her cargo
here and undergo thorough repairs before
proceeding on her voyage.
There was no opportunity for any dis
play of axmanship. The spar parted after
two hours of painful pecking, and the ap
pearance of the remaining stump would
suggest that the Deveron's mizzenmast
had fallen victim to an attack of beavers.
The Deveron left Eureka March 1 with
a carpo of lumber for Liverpool. She en
countered heavy weather soon after leav
ing port, and on March 5, in a fierce
northwester, was boarded by a sea that
completely gutted cabin and forecastle
and threw tne ship on her beam ends.
The ship failed to recover herself, and
for two hours the port rail was under
water. The panic which followed the up
set was quickly dissipated by Captain
AJartinolich. who persuaded the terror
stricken seamen that their only hope for
safety lay in promptly obeying his orders.
He ordered the mizzenmast cut away
close to the deck. Under ordinary cir
cumstances this would have been a sim
ple task for stury seamen armed with
sharp axes. Under the conditions that
prevailed on the Deveron, however. It was
an undertaking fraught with peril and in
volving herculean labor.
The elope of the deck was perpendicular
when deck and water, which covered the
combings of the main hatch, were not at
acute angles. Heavy seas broke over the
craft, which rocked and tossed and
tumbled and made even holding on a
gymnastic feat that strained every mus
cle. In spite of the difficulties, however,
the Deveron sailors worked. They held on
with one hand and plied the ax with the
other. â¢' â¢ ..
and one, bound here, arrived in a
leaking condition. Of the vessels in dis
tress, the condition of the Austrian ship
Deveron was the most serious. That she
arrived at all Is due to the prompt action
of Captain Martinolich, who, by sacrific
ing the mizzenmaat, saved ship, cargo
and the lives of all aboard.
SAN FRANCISCO was popular yes
terday as a harbor of refuge for
disabled sailing craft. Three ves
sels put into this port in distress,
The steamer Eureka arrived here yes
terday from Seattle, after a rough trip
of sixteen- days. Her first and second
mate were both injured during: a heavy
Ftorm. First mate J. W. O'Connor se
verely injured his â¢wrists by a fall and
second mate George JIansfleld fell into
the hold and broke two ribs.
Judge Little of Hilo has a contempt case
which threatens to raise a storm in that
city and .possibly in Honolulu. Little
ordered Sheriff Andrews to have fines
paid in to the clerk of the court, instead
oi remitting them himself to Honolulu.
Andrews did not obey the order, acting, it
is said, on the order of Attorney General
I>ote. He â¢was summoned to answer for
contempt, but the Judse has not yet ren
dered any decision. It has been suggested
tl.ar the court, may jtroceed against the
Attorney General in the matter.
Two murder cases were reported from
other islands by the local steamers ar
riving here on Saturday and Sunday. One
Is that of a Chinese physician at Hana
pepe, Kauai, who has been missing for
several weeks. On the night of February
31 he spent some hours gambling, and
tinally left his companions with SSOO win
nings on his person. His dead body has
been found in a cane field, the money
taken away. At Naalehu a woman named
tSn. William Thompson was killed after
a low during a drinking bout. She was
the wife of a native attorney. The morn
ici^ after the row she was found outside
her home with her head smashed ln.
Ai their last meeting the Home Rule
Republicans emphatically repudiated a
statement given out recently by one of
their leaders that they had decided to
support Sam Parker for Governor. They
also objected tq Indorsement of Secretary
H. E. C'ocper by Mrs. Wllcox, wife of the
delegate. The oarty adopted resolutions
on both subjects, stating its position, ana
ivill send them to Washington.
The British ship Ellen A. Read, seventy
four days from Manila, bound for Port
Townsend, put in here to-day in distress,
having sprung a leak. She encountered
severe weather a large part of the way.
and is maKing four inches of water an

tD examine her and report.
Judge Humphreys ou Saturday rendered
a decision in the divorce case against C.
R. Buckland which it is feared invalidates
a number of divorces granted here since
annexation. Humphreys sustained a.'- de
murrer because the plaintiff had not re
sided here for two years before com
mencing the action. The point had never
Lter. raised here before and it is thought
that some divorces have been illegally
granted in consequence. Humphreys' de
cision was based on a clause of ; the
organic act, which says that no divorces
shall be granted in Hawaii where the ap
plicant has not resided in tne Territory
ror at least two years before bringing the
suit.
The Warren had on board about 700
men. including the second battalion of
the Fifteenth Infantry and about 373 re
cruits. They have oeen brought ashore
and are now encamped in Honolulu, in
front of the National Guard barracks.
There is no drydock in Hawaii larse
enough for a vessel like the Warren, and
It was feared for a time that she would
have to lay here indefinitely, or until a
dry dock is constructed at Pearl Harbor.
Kflorts are now being made to repair
the damage, however, and it is thought
trat the will be able to continue her
journey within ten days from now.

SOME ANSWERS
TO QUERIES BY
CALL READERS
Ru'dyard Kipling hns thken another fling at uiâ
this .time /or our methods in subduing the Filipino
One would think dint Mr. Kipling lind punished us
enough by ; , persuading us to read his beoUs. -
The opposition, as described by Mr. Seabury, con
stitutes a formidable body. It includes, he' says,
"every 'foreign manufacturer, banker, shipowner, ship
agen,t, -, steamship line/ marine insurance company,
every -foreign wage earner and skilled workman]
every foreign manufacturing nation, exporters of for
eign; goods, and also persons living in America but
holding stock in > foreign steamship lines, importers
of foreign products, and every citizen who does not
care to see the American flag flying at the topmast
of an American built and owned steamship."
Such 'is the nature of the antagonism that the
friends' . of .American shipping must overcome, the
fight has already been a long one, but there is rea
son to believe victory is now in sight. The expan
sion of bur foreign trade has made it evident to all
classes of people that we are paying too heavy a
tribute to the foreign shipowner. It is not: likely,
therefore, that the lobby at Washington will be able
to resist the public demnnd for the upbuilding of pur
merchant /.marine.
Mr. Scabury speaks of these as "the constructive
and reconstructive forces that arc essential to main
tain American international and commercial pros
perity."' He rightly assigns the first place to the up
building of our merchant marine. Without that the
others would avail us little. Strangely enough, how
ever, it is against that need that the strongest oppo
sition, is arrayed. For years past the Republican
party; has been pledged to enact some measure to
promote, our industries on the sea, and bills for that
purpose have been repeatedly introduced, but as yet
nothing has been accomplished. Even now the Frye
shipping bill is being opposed and assailed by every
form of fault-finding that opposition can invent; and
where opponents, dare not avow an open hostility to
the measure, they seek to defeat it by objecting to
this or that clause of it, and demanding a bill that in
every detail will satisfy everybody, even the most
captious and most crankv. â¢
GEORGE J. SEAI3URY of New York, in a
recent review of the industrial and commer
cial situation of this country with rcfc-cnce
to. future development, points out that three things
ajc'now essential to the expansion of our prosperity.
these arc an increase ofMhc American merchant ma
rine, to carry our products' to market, the establish
ment of a Department of Commerce to give an in
telligent supervision to our international trade, and
the 'construction of an istlnnjan canal.
AMERICAN SHIPPING. I
A Boston man of reputation has created some
comment by" asserting most positively that he has
seen ghosts. The veracious correspondent does not
say with what brand of spirits the gentleman asso
ciated himself.
These ore some of the advances Russia has made
toward^dominatign in China proper. Her position in
Manchuria seems now so well assured that she will
never be driven biit of that territory, She has there
fore large interests at Â§take, and cannot nfTord to
overlook the menace of the British alliance with
Japin. It is not at all probable that she seeks war.
.Â¦Â¦â¢.' â¢Â¦,.. , . â¢ . . Â¦ , . Â¦ Â¦ .
The writer says: "In 1896 Russia arranged a treaty
with China to build what, is known as the Chinese
eastern railways, connecting the main Siberian
railway with the Gulf of Pechili. In 1898 Russia ar
ranged a treaty with China by which she secured a
great naval station at Port Arthur and an open sea
terminus for her Siberian railroad at Talienwan,
where she has spent several millions of dollars to es-'
tablish a great commercial city. Under cover of a
name known as the 'Belgian syndicate' Russia is
building a railroad from Peking to Hankow and has
acquired a concession to build from Hankow to Can
ton. .She has taken possession of the railroad from
Neuchang to Shanhaikuan, and from there it will be
an easy matter to make connections with Peking,
thus giving her railroad connection from St. Peters
burg to Peking and an extension through the heart
of China to Canton, and, if followed closely with her
army, as in Northern China, will give her control of
alt China." ' â¢
The current/ number of Gunton's Magazine con
tains an article on "The Menace of Russia in China "
contributed by an American in China, which care
fully reviews the progress of the -Russians in that
country and shows the power they have already at
tained. The paper is timely and reveals how much
has been accomplished by the Russians within a com
paratively few years, notwithstanding the repeated
assurances of the Russian Government that no ag
gression upon China is intended or desired.
It is now well understood by the world at large
that the advancing empire of the Czar seeks domina
tion in China, and probably looks forward to even
tual annexation of the whole of it. The old Russian
idea of the conquest of India seems for a time at
least to be abandoned. â¢ China is a far richer country
than India. The resources to be developed arc far
greater. The commercial possibilities arc vaster.
The people arc' more industrious and more homo
geneous than those. 6f India, and, finally, the chances
of conquest arc better, for India is well guarded,
while China is comparatively open. Such being the
case,' the Russian expansionists naturally direct their
present efforts mainly toward China and are resolved
to hold fast to what they have gained.

clement of truth in them. Russia will naturally un

fortify more strongly all her posts in that country by

1 New York has discovered nnother 'human freak,
This newly discovered curlonlty was released from
the legal' ronsequenccs of n jag the other diiy by i
Gotham Judge who Indicted upon the culprit the nwÂ»
ful alternative of reading n Journal editorial. It I*
safe to say that everybody else would -have preferred
to have gone to jail rather than accept the editorial
dose. Such punishments should be placed in the
category of those prohibited by law.
Shortly before retiring from the office of Secretary
of the Treasury Mr. Gage in an address to the
American Bankers' Association said: "Looked at
from the standpoint of true statesmanship it' 1 would
appear that the present is the most propitious hour
in all our history, and as favorable. as any period we
may hope for in the future, to enter upon reasonable
and judicious measures to eliminate air elements of
financial weakness which experience has brought to
light and to perfect our now faulty system of cur
icncy." With that statement intelligent men of all
parties will agree, and while there will be of course
difference* of opinion concerning some of the de
tail* of the bill reported by the House Committee on
nsnking and Currency, there will be a general grati
fkstion that the Ihuo.U to.be met at once and that
the neccsiary changes In our currency system, are to
be vmade while we arc in the right condition 'for
tfjcm.
That there will be partisan opposition to the bill is
of course to be expected, and yet it would seem that
the Democrats of the South and the Populists of the
West might well be pleased with the measure since
it is designed to give those sections a larger and
more elastic currency than they now possess! It
provides a means for putting into circulation the
money now locked up in the treasury, and, moreover,
it enables communities where capital is scarce to ob
tain currency without having to lock up capital in
Government bonds. In short, it offers advantages to
districts far removed from financial centers which
they have not enjoyed before, and furnishes them an
easy way of profiting by the capital of the whole
country and having a currency circulation at all
times responsive to the demands of their enterprises
and at low rates of interest.
The banking bill reported to the House is designed
to meet just the needs pointed out by the President.
It purposes to transfer from the Government to the
banks a large part of the responsibility of protecting
the gold reserve of the country, to provide a cur
rency responsive to the needs â¢ of trade that will
everywhere equalize the average interest rate and
thus remedy one of the most serious drawbacks to
industry and business in the West and South, and
to remove every doubt concerning our standard of
value.
The" old faying, "In time of peace prepare for
war," has its application here. In times of financial
Fccurity and business prosperity preparations should
be made for meeting panics and hard times when
they come. In his message to Congress President
Roosevelt urged action upon this question, saying:
"In many respects the national banking law fur
nishes sufficient liberty for the proper exercise of the
banking functions, but there seems to be. need of
better safeguards against 'the deranging influences of
commercial crises and financial panics. Moreover,
the currency of the country should be made respon
tivc to' the demands of our domestic trade and com
merce." '
The time is go opportune for legislation of this
kind that Congress might well waive minor objec
tions for the Â«akc of prompt action. The important
matter is to put our monetary system upon a well
ordcrcu bam, and to get it out of the arena of party
politics, -I, that there will be no political disturbances
hereafter in the operations of our banking and cur
rency.
BY the presentation of Â« comprehensive bank
ing and currency bill to tho House tho issues
involved in tho reform of our monetary sys
tnii on prevented to the country in a definite thape,
bud there is a prbipect they will bo settled at thii
teuton "I Cohgicsi, It Is nut to be expected that
the bill will talitfy c\cr>body, but u deals so fairly
with all tin- financial intcrciu of Hie country that
while it may tmderg? amendment it will doubtless
receive Republican support substantially bs reported.
CURRENCY LEGISLATION.
H will be admitted Hint llili criticism U lovely riu!
l.Â« /airly Muted, Mid yet let us tlb the 'committee Jiim
tlce. Wlmt'wmild It have rivalled to show Henry
those things without nho.wlng him California? Since
he had not time 'to come to thin eurtst and see the
true Kdcn of Amcilca It was perhaps wrll that he
wns permitted to see none of it. Ho will now fco
home knowing Hint ho wns sHown the best of our
cities nnd rcftllctng that ho saw the worst of our cli
mate. Some day he may wish to sec the best of thill
alio, tmd then he will come direct to California.
It is not necessary to follow the whole of this com
praint. It is, alas! too true. Consider rather what
Henry missed. The Constitution says he might
have seen, among other things: "Charleston, with
her famous fortresses' and her splendid West Indian
aVd^ CottGn States exposition, showing the wealth of
resources of the most opulent domain under the
sun; Savnnnah and her State-making memories;
St. Augustine, with Spanish ruins and modern pal
aces that Aladdin might have env!e\l; the climate of
a regnant sv.n, of breezes snturnted with the perfumes
of the orprge, the magnolia and the jessamine; the
nmbie'it, wooing airs of the gulf stream; *New Or
lennft and her ninrveln of nneient nnd up'to-dnte en
icrprlK'x; Montgomery, the cradle of the Confeder
acy; nndâ Atlanta, the peerless plienlx, sprung from
the nth lionpi of war to diuxle Imagination nnd eli,iN
leugo the dominion of a new and triumphant Mouth
lunill"
WITH the general run of criticisms upon the
rcceptloh given to Prince Henry of Prus
sia in this country The Call hn& no sym
pathy. In fact, most of them seem to have emanated
from crnnki, kickers, blatherskites and yellow jour
nals, and were lacking equally in reason und in man
ners. The Atlanta Constitution, however, has pre
sented a criticism' that merits notice. It is based
upon facts, and truth gleams from every sentence of
it It is not an expression of bad manners or bad
feelings, but the tender utterance of a friend pointing
out a grievous mistake and covering the thorn . of
criticism with a rose of poetic imagery.
The complaint of the Constitution is that the com
mittee having charge of what it calls "Henry's zig
zaggery" gave him too much bad weather and too
little good weather. They took him where he saw-
America at its worst, and denied him the joy of sec
ing that portion of it which at this season is sun
lighted and gemmed with flowers. They took him,
says our contemporary, through "about the coldest
succession of snow scenes and dissolving views of fog
banks, floods and' frost-bitten populations that the
country affords. His chiefest ideas concerning the
United States are bound to be that when we are not
frozen up we are afloat. The" Board of Bumology
whooped him around New York through snowdrifts
nine feet deep, whisked him about the national capi
tal in one of those Washington rains that make faith
in the Noachian deluge dead easy, slammed him into
a washout at Philadelphia, and caromed him into
Chattanooga under conditions that made Lookout
Mountain seem like a peak of salvation."
WHAT HENRY MISSED.
It is stated that magazine publishers and the lec
ture bureaus have already opened negotiations with
Miss Stone, the ransomed missionary, but as the lady
was sworn to secrecy by, the bandits before they re
leased her, it is hard to see how Â»he will be able to
tell anything the public desires to know. After all,
however, for a modern magazine or lecture bureau
the name is the main thing! What is said is a matter
of no importance. *
Those who know his narrowness nnd the spiteful
streak in him believe that this Is his plan. Of course
it will be Intended to defeat Hill or any other who
may take his place In the somewhat frosty favor of
the Democracy. Republicans care but little about
the fight, except bs a mean* of diversion, Hut not
so with Mr. nrynn, He netunlly tnkci himself se
riousjy, and estimates his ,sl*e so generously that he
seems to chafe against the universe.
One significant thing is Mr. Bryan's defense of
the grave of Populism. That body is deceased and
interred. But he stands on its grave and eulogizes it.
Does it all mean that he hopes for a resurrection with
the intention of bejiu the candidate of the Populbts
and Socialists in 1004?
The country is very busy, but will anticipate
recreation -'when the New Yorker is heard from
again. Will he try confectionery or a club on Mr.
Bryan? Will he soothe or irritate him? Will-he
make him yell some more, or will they sing together
"Blest be the tie that binds"? X
Hill is an intrepid politician, but his intrepidity is
modified by caution. He evidently had no idea that
his peaceful overtures would make Mr. Bryan turgid.
He thought that when he offered that, distinguished
agriculturist the olive branch^ and the pruning-hook
and plow, the milking-stool, , husking-peg, scythe,
hayrake and hoe, and all the other emblems of rural
peace and plenty, he would not refuse. But instead
of accepting these neighborly tokens. Mr. Bryan
squirts vitriol, goes to his recrimination pigeon
hole and pulls out enough .vengeance to equip a
Kentucky vendetta and lets fly his stinger with all
the venom of a bald-face hornet.
The country is amused. It would Yathcr Â«cc the
Democratic organization in hands better and safer
for the public interests than 'Mr. Bryan's. But he
lefuses to let go. He has made the organization a
carcase, on which he crouches growling at all who
approach. As long as he docs this he leaves no
course for self-respecting Democrats except to snub
the polls or support the Republican candidates who
suit them best in their personal aspect.
All this was so displeasing to Mr. Bryan that he
daubed him with war paint and decked him with
feathers and climbed Hill 'with a whoop. He ac
cuses the New Yorker of making a bid for the Presi
dency, of jumping on', the Populists when they
were not looking and, of having sulked nnd skulked
in thcMa/t two, campaigns. 1 lie serves notice' that if
Hill is nominated he will bolt and injure him. It
is evident that Mr. Biyan regards himself as a can
didate again, and. proposes to permit no opposition,
The place is up- at' auction, but there must be only
one bidder.
MR. BRYAN has -concluded to seek fame by
assaulting the Hill of New York, as a politi
cal Rough Rider. The sadly inharmonious
Democracy held a harmony service in the New
York Manhattan Club on February 22. Governor
Hill appeared there and made an adroit speech, a
mixture of the hiethods of Martin Van Buren and
Dean Richmond. It outlined the conditions of party
harmony, held' out the prospect of success by re
union of the ranks, smote Populism in the fifth rib,
and altogether was an exceedingly ingenious attempt
to pour glue on the cracked party and make it ser
viceable, for the future. ,* U,

tlm "Hull un has In his treasury a collection
which oven at a forced sale would pay
tho entire debt of the country. Tho treas
ury consists of three large halls full of all
BortB of â¢ precious articles, but, unfortu
nately, the light is so bad that, a close In
spectlon Is almost impossible. At the en
trance a splendid throne, captured from
tho Persians, is the first object Been. It
Is onn mass of pearls, and is studded all
over with precious stones. The first hall
la filled with a vast collection of gold and
silver cups and plates, ' ancient stone?.
Jeweled daggers, swords, knives and
suits of armor. From the top of a second
throne hangs a huge emerald, which looks
too large to be iÂ«/il. Cases around the
room contain necklaces, brooches and
rings by hundreds. A dressing table cov
ered with pearls is exceedingly beautiful.
Among this mass of treasures it Is rather
surprising to find such articles as modern
silver-mounted dressing bags, telescopes,
photographic cameras and even a case of
razors. The next hall is given up to gold
and silver ornaments and blue china, and
lovely v sets of coffee cup holders worked
in . gold and silver and precious stones,
with a magnificent collection of enameled
copper bowls. Among the ornaments were
many, toys made out of the mosf precious
material. The body of one little doll was
formed out of a single pearl. The third
hall contains quantities of coins. No at
tempt has been made to classify them,
but they are beautifully arranged in large
cases. No one in the treasury, not even
the guardians, seems to know anything
about the history of the articles confided
to their care.

ETBEET WOBK DECISION
/ ON FRONT TOOT BULB
Several protestants against tho Pat
tridge Bite were heard, all of whom ob
jected to the location of a pesthouse in
that vicinity because property values
would be depreciated. Supervisor Curtis
pleaded for the removal of the hospital
from Twenty-sixth street to the place
thtit would suffer the least harm thereby.
The ordinances .fixing the minimum
standard quality and illuminating power
of eas and the maximum price to be
charged therefor, also lixing the minimum
rute to be charged for electric lights and
for electricity for heat and power pur
poses, were finally passed. The rate for
g&8 to consumers and public buildings is
fixed at $130 per thousand cubic feet and
for lighting streets 9 cents per lamp and
15 cents for each cluster lamp. The rate
for electric lights is fixed at 11 cents per
thousand watt hours, with usual dis
counts, according to quantity.
Supervisor d'Ancona, chairman of the
Hospital Committee, said the majority of
the committee had recommended the Bay
View Land Company's site because it
realized that the location of the pesthouse
on the Pattrldgo site would Jeopardize the
commercial Interests of South San .Fran
cisco.
It Is in a sightly location, but people fa
miliar with it for years state that it 1> wind
swept, without the afternoon sun, and catches
the summer fogs. With an appropriation of
but 115,000 in all, which the Hospital Com
mittee has repeatedly declared it must not
exceed, but which must cover the entire out
lay, but $5000 to $700U would be available with
which to meet all of. the expenses meutioned
and to construct the buildings.
The liny View Association offers a barren
tract \>f land un a hllulde, unimproved and
without a road leading to itâ ten acres for
?111,000, or, possibly eight acres for $8WK>, a
prlca frankly admitted by the agent to be
double its market price. It is fully a mllu
â¢farther away than llay View Farm, by road,
tho only objection offered U> the latter hav
ing been its (Distance. There Is no water de
veloped on the new tract, - no assurance that
any can be found there, and, assuming , that
it has no water supply, the owners have of
fered the hue of another lot, a 'third of a
mile distant, where the city may hope to
develop water and thence convey it, by a
power plant, to the proposed site, which is
100 feet higher, where a large and expensive
reservoir must be constructed to guard against
a water famine in case of accident to ! the
system.
Supervisor Payot, a member of the Hos
pital Committee, filed a minority, report,
iccommendlng tho selection of the l'ut
trldge tract. Payot assigned as his mi
runs that the Health Hoard had reportud
In favor of this tract on. account of Us
accessibility and that thu natural con
veniences on tha site ure superior in every
way to the Day View Land Company's
tÂ»*uct. Â» The report contained a description
of tho advantages of tho Pattrldgo situ and
the objections to tho new site offered.
Tho objections noted by Payot follow J
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
passed to print the resolution offering the
Hay View Land Company $800 per acre
for a seven-acre tract of land to be used
bb a site for a pesthouae. There was no
objection to the selection of the site, the
\oh* being unanimously In favor of It an
agulnst the Pattrldge site.

Investigation. City Engineer Grunsky
filed a report, fixing $1,81)8,403 as a new
valuation on that portion of the Alamedu
Creek system used by the Spring Valley
Water Company In supplying water to
this city. This does not Include the
Calaveras Creek purchases and the Ala
meda pipe line. The report says:
It appears from the figures submitted by the
Spring Valley Water Company as the -coat -of
the properties on the Alamecla and Calaveras
Creek systems, apart from the purchase of
the Calavcras property and of additional lands
contiguous thereto, which purchases amount In
the aggregate to $1,1G9.C5O, that the water
company has expended on that system $1,898,
4i>3. As an addition to this sum the company
claims that interest paid during 1001 â¢ to the
amount of $111,410 should be added.
Comparing this amount of $1,808,403 with
last year's allowance, $1,309,000, for the Ala
meda Creek system above Miles, to which
$504,410, .a contribution to this system in 1901,
ere to be added, making $1,87:1,410, there re
mains about $25,000 unaccounted for.
This discrepancy is probably due either to
incompleteness or misinterpretation of data at
hand last year when the approval was made.

If *ou Kill the Dandruff Germ With
the New Treatment.
John N. Fuller, a well-known citizen of
Colfax. Wash., nays: "I had dandruff so
badly that it caked on my ecalp. Herpl-
clde completely cured me." George H.
McWhirk of Walla Walla, Wash., says:
"Herpicidc completely cured me of a bad
case of dandruff of thirty years' stand-
ing." They took tho only really sensible
treatment, a remedy that destroys the
dandruff germâ Newbro's Herplclde. Stop
dandruff, hair won't fall out. but will
grow naturally, luxuriantly. Allays Itch-
ing instantly and makes hair glossy and
soft as silk. At druggists'. One bottle
will convince any doubter of its merits.
A Waste of Words,
Expletives/ spent over frayed collars,
torn shirts, poorly washed skirts lose
time and gain nothing. Patronize the
U. S. Laundry for a change and see if
you cannot get better satisfaction. We

and the result should be pleasing. Just

NEW YORK. March 10. â Efforts were made
to contest the influence of the Saturday bank
statement during . the early hours of to-day's
stock mai ket. but late in the day belated
borrowers ran up the money rate by their
bidding against each other and predictions were
heard from the - best authorities that money
would rule higher in the Immediate future.
The disaster to the British arms .in South
Africa had a strong sentimental effect, ai
though the direct influence was restrained by
the fact that the London stock market was
closed when the news was received. Traders
here sold etocks on the supposition that the
news will induce some liquidation for London
account and also may affect the money mar
ket by accentuating the pressure for gold in
London. Reports by accepted authorities that
the condition of winter wheat was not prom
ising were also a bearish influence. The whole
market gave way and closed active and weak
â¢with a large number of leading stocks from
J to 2% points lower than Saturday's closing
j 'rices. There were many assurances put forth
this morning, apparently in concert, that noth
ing was to be feared from the money-market
in spite of the low stage of the reserves. The
principal burden of these .arguments .was to
the effect that a large proportion of the pres
ent 'large loans of the New York Clearing
House banks are to railroad and industrial syn
dicates, made up of the most prominent capi
talists. The point is also made that sufficient
account has not been taken of the great ex-
I<ansion In capital and surplus of the banks
and exaggerated account taken of. the small
increases in cash reserves. These arguments
evidently had some academic force but they
were not sufficient to dissuade the email
Hieculator. from selling out stocks when he
raw the index finger of the money rate point-
Ing to higher figures. It will require a ses
sion of the London Stock Exchange to measure
the effect of the news from South Africa. 1*
Is fortunate that progress had been made in
the liquidation of recent extravagant specu
lation In Kaffirs, but there has been a growing
conviction that the struggle in South Africa
was drawing to a close and that the forthcom
ing Government loan would be the last required
I for war expenditure there. How great a shock
this newt will bo will â¢ be watched with in
terest by all other markets. The principal
feature of to-day's early market was the re
|sewal of the upward movement In Colorado

CHICAGO. March 10.â At the start In the
wheat pit there was a goodly array of bullish
argumentsâ cables were firm, . both Liverpool
and Paris; continued dry weather was reported
in the, winter wheat belt; receipts were light,
and commission houses had good .buying or
ders. Coarse grains were improved and aided
in the ua-turn. Under these Influences May
opened %c to up at 78V&C to 77%c and ad
vanced to 7S^4c. On the advance numerous
longs who had bought early last week sold for
profitÂ£.y Prices steadied for some time around
78c, but when reports arrived of showers It
some localities of Kansas and Nebraska the
prop under wheat gave way, selling became
general and somewhat heavy and prices de
clined. There was much speculation as to
what the Government report of grains in
farmers' hands would state. There were .bear
ish Drellmlnary estimates that the reserveb
would be from 180,000,000 bushels to 200,000,
000 bushels. Trade wan fairly active. May
closed weak, %c lower, at 77c.
Corn was influenced chiefly by wheat, ruling
firm at the outset and sagging off on bearish
news, though not to such an extent as wheat.
Mxy closed weak, %@%c lower, at 61%@61%c.
Oats were dull, with an Inclination to sag in
sympathy with other grains. Closed easy, %c
lower, at 44 % c. â¢

.. WHEAT â Chicago was firmer at the opening
on better cables, and continued dry weather in
the Southwest, and there -was more disposition
to buy. Later on, however, there was some
realizing and short selling- on lack of outside
support and weakness in corn. The world's
shipments for the week were as follows, In
quarters: Russian, 138,000; Danublan, 53,000;
Argentina, â¢ 142,000; Indian. 9000; Australian,
180,000. The American visible supply decreased
838,000 bushels, while the amount on passage
to the United Kingdom increased 1.040.1HK)
bushels.
Snow came out with a statement of crop con
ditions, which attracted general attention. He
says that the situation warrants grave appre
hension over the most important territory. The
crop is late and the growth is small. The root
development in Texas and Arkansas is hurt
tteyond recovery, and those States will not
have over half a crop. Oklahoma is badly
damaged. Kentucky and Tennessee show a
condition of Â£0 to 80 per cent. Ohio is seriously
hurt. Indiana and Illinois are below the nor
mal. Kansas will have a serious shortage of
moisture, and the condition of the crop is crit
ical. Nebraska Is. perfect, and the condition of
the Pacific Coast Is high.

SEAL ESTATE TEANSACTIONS.
Â¦ The feeling in Eggs yesterday was mixed.
Wholesalers generally quoted 14c aÂ« the be3t
price for ranch, and heavy retailers adver
tised to sell their finest ranch at 15c. This
they could afford to do, as they bought down
town at 13@14c, but even this margin of profit
is very small, if Indeed there is any margin.
The clear dry weather enabled the . commis
sion merchants to place considerable lines' in
store, and thus relieve the market of some
of its surplus. The Jobbers and fruit men,
who receive small lots of Eggs from the coun
try, quoted rather more steadiness to the mar
ket,' but for "the great bulk of the day's busi
ness 14c was about the top quotation. The
general impression, however, is that the bot
tom has been'reached.
â¢ Receipts were 47,000 pounds 8 tubs of Butter,
1238 cases of Eggs, 2300 pounds of California

Cheese is In a peculiar condition, as already
mentioned. Old is bringing as much if not
more than new, and Young Americas are at the
moment not worth any more than the other
descriptions, as the demand for them Is small.
Conditions seem completely reversed in this
product.
Prices for Butter remained about as before,
but the feeling was weak as receipts were free
and the demand halting.

American stocks did not really open till New
Tork came slightly harder.
Gold to the amount of Â£219,000 arrived from
Holland on Saturday and Â£25,000 additional
to-day. v
The stock market was idle and dull through
out the session. The capture of a Boer maga
eine of arms and ammunition was counteracted
by the disquieting news about the health of
Cecil Rhodes and hints that trouble is brewing
between Russia and Japan. Kaffirs were very
flat after the .close of business in the street on
the- announcement In the House of Commons
that the Boers had captured General Methuen,
400 men and four guns. Consols dropped %
to 94% on^the Exchange, but the capture of
Methuen at that time was only rumored. .

moment the epot market for the more impor
tant articles continues steady and presents
Â«*vwal strong: features. There is reported a.
somewhat firmer feeling in prunes, with 40
60' f showing 6ome speculative Interest. Sev
eral lots are said to have been picked up on
the epot at a shade under 6%c in 25-lb boxes.
Coast advices report holders firm on the 3%C
four-fire basis for new Santa Claras In bags
end 3c for old Santa Claras. Spot position in
eises under 40-50's in new fruit shows rather
more interest, but the views of holders are no
higher. In old fruit the feellns: Is reported
somewhat eaey on the small sizes, due to large
arrivals and quality of some of the fruit. In j
apricots the market continues to show firm
ness and a good Jobbing outlet is noted. Strict
ly choice royals are very firm, but some offer
ings of dark fruit are available at less than

of holders are maintained within the quoted
nnge. In currants a cable from Greece to-day
quotes the market at the equivalent of 5%c
laid down here on fine Amalias in barrels.

market over cable advices of the previous day.
The epot market Is showing easiness, with 5%e
to 5 We quoted on fine Amalla grade in bar
rels. A moderate Jobbing interest only is
noted for both uneleaned and cleaned. In rat
sins the demand for seeded is fair, and in some
quarters the views of sellers show firmness.

be had at S^c for choice and 8%c for fancy.
Loose raisins are firm, with 3-crown grade
held at 7c. Valencia layers are steady and
firm at 7 14c. In dates the market. is showing
firmness at the advanoe on Khadrawee. Figs

The comedy, "A Coat of Many Colors,"
by Madeline Lucette Ryley, had its in
itial presentation in this 1 dtylit the Alca
zar Theater last night, before an appre
ciative audience. It did not go with the
snap that usually characterizes first night
productions at this popular theater, owing
to the apparent fact ' that some- of . the
players were not very familiar with. their
lines. The story concerns a young woman
lawyer, who comes to New York from
California, at the request of her father,
to consult with Herman Walboys, a law
yer, as to ferreting out the parentage of
a child now grown . to womanhood. It is
now desired Â¦ to bring- the parents to
gether and right the child In the eyes of
the world. Walboye . falls . in love with
the young woman, and it Â¦"* develops . that
she herself Is the illegitimate child.
Everything, however, ends happily by
the marriage of her parents and her en
gagement to Walboya. M. L. Alsop as
WalboyB, the lawyer, has a good,concep
tion of the part, but he stumbled over his
lines last night considerably, - Another
night or no will no doubt sea this reme
died, - Henry Shumer as Hamilton.'Wal
boys, who mixes things up by: marrying
the daughter of William McWhirter, the
enemy of the Walboys family, was ade
quate.' George Osbburne, the dandified
father of the Walbcys boys, as usual; was
equal to the occasion, Howard Scott as

There Is little use in commenting upon
the show presented at the Orpheum this

and are heartily encored upon the com
pletion of every effort. While Billy. Clif
ford does not sing any new songs tnis
week, he renders the old ones in such In
imitable style that he retains his old pop
ularity. The Nelsons are beyond descrip
tion. The family of, nine is doing an aero
batlc stunt this week that will be seldom,
if ever, eclipsed at the Orpheum. Eva
Mudge, the "American girl who captured
London," is also capturing this city with
her marvelously quick changes and nlco
voice. Les Troubadores Toulouslans are
four' vocalists whose voices blend -In a
charming manner. Paul Clnquevalll, the

Orpheum has ever presented to its pa
trona. With seemingly no effort, this
light-fingered, quick-eyed man : performs
feats that appear almost impossible with
slippery billiard balls arid - unevenly bal
'anced cues. - He gives' an exhibition : of
balancing that is- simply marvelous. He
also juggles a forty-eight pound cannon
ball with the same ease that he would

KANSAS CITY, Mo., March 10.â A man ar
rested here last week on suspicion that he was
Bennett, the supposed murderer of Nora Ful
ler, a Ean Francisco girl, proved to be a well
known Kantian City man who bore a good
character, and he wag discharged. Captain
Seymour of San Francisco arrived here last
nfght on the strength of & message from Chief
Hayes and returned West to-day, declaring the
suspect? waa not the man wanted. Chief Hayes,
realizing eoon after the arrest that a mistake
had been made, failed to make the matter
public 'Â¦'* ' \ .
Chief Wittman even went so far as to
deny that he had received word from
Captain Seymour since he made his sud
den departure from this city.
When seen last night Chief Wittman
said: j
"In the absence of a personal telegram
frcm Captain Seymour I am inclined to
disbelieve all the newspaper reports in
connection with his movements since he
left the city. It was understood that he,
should telegraph me, and as he has not
done so I will refrain from denying or
affirming any newspaper dispatches re
ceived from Kansas City or anywhere
else."
The dispatches received last night are
as follows:-
Everything in connection with the case
seems to indicate that Captain Seymour's
mission has been in vain. Chief Witt
man, however, was absolutely non-com
mittal last night an the subject of Sey
mour or what succes he met in the under
taking.
According to telegraphic dispatches re
ceived here last night. Chief of Detectives
Jchh Seymour Is now oh his way back
from Kaasas City, Mo. The much-want
ed murderer of Nora Fuller is not' with
hinr. and the police are just as far off as
they were on the night the body of the
girl was discovered in the house on Sut
ter street.

Seymour Is on the Wrong
Scent.
XANSAS CITY SUSPECT
NOT THE STBANGLER
HERE, is a good-natured audience
I down at the Grand Opera-house.
I Its gratitude for the occasional
ii, witticism in the new Broadhurst
farce that was exploited there
last night was simply touching. Perhaps
it felt, which was true, that some de
cently clever folk were doing their best
with some exasperatlngly bad material,
and sympathized accordingly. "The
House That Jack Built" is a farce on
the Hoy t order, with all the faults of the
species, and only an occasional gleam of
the fun that persuades to its acceptance.
It has not even the mock-plausible plot
of its kind, the very modest thread of
likelihood demanded by the farce-goer,
but offers a story In which fun and thfe
farce-probabilities are alike ignored.
There are- glimpses of the might-have
been In "The House That Jack Built,"
incidents 'almost funny, one genuinely
comic situation, two or three characters
with strong humorous possibilities about
them, just enough to Irritate with their
unfulflllment of promise. .'
The company on the whole does â¢ very
well, indeed, with the material. Mar
garet Terry shines conspicuously as Mrs.
Dooley, an Irish lady with ambitions
toward the English aristocracy. She
brings a quick wit and Intelligence to her
worfc> and makes as much fun out of the
character as could possibly be made. Wil
liam Bernard, as an old man desirous pf
posing as a young one, does good- work,
and Herschel Mayall in a part that falls
as an English baronet, looks well and
carries off all of its scanty honors. George
Dber has a Bulger role In > William Slab,
but evidently finds no inspiration therein.
Lillian â¢ Albertson, the pretty young
woman who is making such rapid strides
in her work lately, plays the daughter
of Dr. Jack, and does It well. All through
the company is better than the farce, and
it Is, a pity to see them wasting their
time on It. The piece is very well
mounted.
Next week Melbourne MacDowell, in a
Sardou repertoire, will begin an engage
ment. .
sented respectively by Harry Rattenbury
and -Royal Dana Tracy, should be
omitted from the play. Rattenbury' b idea
of an Englishman is grotesque in the ex
treme. Marlon Convere as Esther Gun
ning, the lady lawyer, was bright and
charming, and Oza Waldrop as Lola Mc-
Whirter Walboys had a part that suited
her admirably. Margaret Wycherley al
ways shines as a woman of the world,
and as Mrs. Majendie, the erring mother
in the case, she was up to her usual stan
dard. ' .
Ferris Hartman is tunefully mystified,
Arthur Cunningham Is barytohically be
wildered, Yvonne Lichter and Dolores
Graham are songfiilly puzzled for the rea
son of the peculiar success of "The Sere
nade." The first week drew big houses
and it was expected that the second would
in the usual order of things show a slight
falling yff, but strange to relate the sec
pnd week's attendance was. larger and
more enthusiastic, than the first. Then it
was decided to run "The" 1 ' Serenade" for
another seven days and the management
and the managed were delighted and sur

SAN RAFAEL, March 10.â Trouble is j
in store for the promoters of the cocking ;
main that took place at San Quentin yes- j
terday. Sheriff Taylor and District At
torney Mclsaac are incensed over the af
fair and since yesterday the former has ;
been making a still hunt to learn who was ',
there. It \\&s_ said to-night that there
would be a wholesale issuance o,f war
rants for various men of prominence Sn
San Rafael, San Francisco and Oakland.
District Attorney llclsaac says that he
will use every endeavor to convict the
owners of the gamecocks and the spec
tators of the main.
Many of the prison guards in San Quen
tin are known to have attended the main
and will come in for a reprimand, while
certain Marin County officials will be ;
catechised as to their whereabouts yes- 1
terday afternoon. Warden Aguirre was
not aware of the contest being held near
his domain and even Captain Russell of
the prison guard was not cognizant of the
affair until it was ended. The main was
planned with great secrecy. The cocks
Â¦were shipped to San Quentin several days
ago and even though Under Sheriff Litch
cnberg was on the same train with the
crowd from San Francisco he was not
aware what was coming off, merely sup
posing that the prison was to have an
extra large number of visitors that day.
The Society for the Prevention of Cru-
Lflty to Animals has taken up the affair.
Dr. C E. Case, secretary of the society,
has been here all day looking up evidence.
He was emphatic in his determination to
have the affair sifted down and gained
much information as. to who were pres

The champion now weighs between 223
and 230 pounds, though he is not quite as
heavy as on Jii3 previous visit, when ho t
tipped the beam at 240 pounds. Jeffries
was not at all averse to discussing his
plans and his present health. Said the bis;
fellow: '
"I am feeling fine now, and" have been
ever since I had that bad cold in New
York."
Jeffries was asked how- he liked "the
prospect of meeting Fitzsimmona in Loa
Angeles before the Century Club, and the
big man's answer was just as every one
who knew him was sure it would be:
"Los Angeles is my home; I like it, and "I
would rather flght here than anywhere
else in the country. â¢ What financial in
ducements they can offer here I can't say
yet, because I don't know for sure, but
as for going anywhere else in preference
to this town, that is all rot. -
Racing Men Will Be Absent.
"There will be plenty of clubs out after
the mill, but I just received a telegram
from San Francisco that has some bad
news in it for us. The telegram says that
the northern racing will close about the
third week in April, and I am sure that
Fitzsimmons will not get Into the rlns
before May 1. I don't suppose the north
ern clubs will want to offer as much, ~or
that the mill will draw nearly as much
as if it came off in the racing season.
That was'tny hope. I thought we coulfi
fix it up all right, because I supposed the
racing would last until May at any rate.
The Southern Athletic Club of Louisville
will be there with a good bit of a bid, and
it may get It. They teir me that the
clubs are flghthig in San Francisco, but
I guess they will patch up their row
somehow in time to get in some bids; I
suppose if they do that Harry Corbett
will be behind the offers."
Then Jeffries asked a question of Man
ager McCarey, who was standing near.
Said he:
"Mac, where would you have the mill
If it came here?" . . . .
"We were thinking . of the ball park,"
was the rejoinder.
"You could take care of any crowd that
was likely to show up there, I suppose?"
remarked Jeffries.
He was assured such was the fact.
"That's not such a bad scheme, either."
spoke up the big fellow, after he had
mused a minute, with eyes bent down
toward the floor. *
Talks About Fitzsimmons.
"I want to say something about Fitz
simmons," continued the champion. "He
is a good fighter, and If there's anybody
that doesn't 'think so I can put' him right
soon. I have spent mucft money to get
Fitz and have chased him all over the
country, because there are some people
who think he can beat me. If he can -I
want to know it. I don't underestimate
him a bit. I have fought him and I know
him. Fitz hits out like a mule and you
never know when he is going to cut loose
with a terrific wallop. He is a dangerous
man and a hard one to beat, but I think
I "can put him away."
Jeffries was asked what he had figured
on as the probable gate receipts of the
contest if pulled off in San" Francisco in
conjunction with the racing, and he said
he supposed they would be about $45,000.-
LOS ANGELES, March 10.â Big and
strong, and in the pink . of condition,
Champion James J. Jeffries rolled into
town this afternoon on the belated Owl
train, and was greeted at the station by
several of- his friends.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
It has been asserted that Sandona has
brought with him to San Francisco the
painting characteristics of Boldlni.
Very well, then, and though Sandona
denies it, let it be that he Is inspired with
the boldness and the dash and the pose
originality of the master. What of it if
Sandona,. like Boldinl, gives realism, life,
boul and -action to his portraits? Surely
it were well were it so; and since 'tis said
to be so, then 'tis well, indeed, if, as said,
'tis so â¢-â¢â¢"â¢â¢ : -
Sandona would have his brother knights
of the brush and palette know that an
honest portrait should come before the
fabric of a dress. Portrait first, and the
costume is of secondary consideration,
declares the prize pupil of the Royal
Academy of Verona. Speaking of his pic
tures which have caused the controversy,
he declares when alluding to the Jeffrey
canvas that the figure represents the
j lady's natural pose. It is individual, he
says, and it is his aim to get the individ
i uallty of his subject. The spirit of the
subject is the. most difficult to obtain, and
to get that spirit on canvas has been his
object. He is satisfied that he has been
successful.
However, the pictures are on the wall
and It will now be "up to" the public to
decide.
Says Pose Is Natural.
He arrived in this city about one year
ago from Verona, Italy, where he had
taken four prizes in as many years at the
Royal Academy. Sandona's specialty is
figure and portrait painting, and one of
his studies was "hung" â¢ by the Hopkins
Art Institute iat,- its last exhibition of
water colors, which acceptance made him
eligible for membership. It was his por
trait painting that won him the coveted
prizes at Verona of which he is justly
proud.
A pupil of Bianchi and Nani, the young
painter has therefore had the advantage
of sage advice and rare instruction.
But Matteo Sandona has a talk also. He
is a very young man, a mild young man,
with a pastel disposition, a water color
foreground and a background made up of
the sttrner coloring, tor, though placid
to look upon, Sandona has strength of de
termination.
The feeling among the jurors has been
that Sandona could do better work, and
they were not satisfied with the likeness
of the painting to the ex-Mayor, nor could
they commend the drapery as painted by
Sandona in the Jeffrey picture, though
the likeness in the lady's case was ad
mitted to be excellent. The draperies are
the snag which entangled the -jury, and
it is said the directors, in the folds and
frills of dissension.
Could Not Commend Drapery.
A. F. MathevÂ» T s, one of the jurors, has,
however, evidently, receded from his de
termination expressed several days ago,
when he said: "If we (meaning the jury)
decide that pictures shall not be exhib
ited, we, stick to that decision and no one
will get them up."
It was the Sandona pictures he allud
ed to.
The paintings in Question are of well
known people of the city. The two which
were at first rejected were of Miss Doris
Jeffrey and ex-Mayor Phjelan, while the
three that were accepted were paintings
of Mrs. F. Holder, P. Rossi and J. W.
Byrne.
The jury feels that It has been coerced
into hanging the last mentioned canvases
and from'* tnat supposition has arisen /a
determination on the Jury's part to carry
a resolution condemning interference with
future verdicts.
Certain it is that the jury, after ac
cepting three out of five pictures sent by
Matteo Sandona, suddenly recalled the
rejected canvases and sullenly agreed to
have them "hunc."
The jury Intends to kick with Rugby
vigor against any interference with its
decisions in the future, which is a some
what strong insinuation that some one
in the official secrets has not approved
of the findings of the artist-Jurors.
The jury selected to pass upon th.e pic
tures for the art exhibition which will bo
opened on Thursday evening at the Hcjp
kins Art Institute has had troubles of
its own and little bickerings with others,
and the whole made into a. composite
growl is to be pitched into the. midst of
the directorate of the institute." .
To the 'Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: The
District Council of Carpenters and Joiners,
desirous of bsingr at all iiroes thoroughly and
clearly understood on all matters appertaining
to our craft and the general building business,
requests you to grant it space in order to place
the council right before the public.
Certain jre.ttlemen â carpenters by trade â are
now and have for some time past been engaged
In an endeavor to confuse the minds of the
contractors and mechanics alike engaged In the
buildlns business. In the press of yesterday
two Of these gentlemen, L.. I). Gordon and
J. Marcus Burke, president and secretary
respectively of Union No. 483, came out with
one of the old-time scurrilous and threadbare
arguments which emanate only from the maa
pursuing â¢ a lost cause. In an endeavor to
answer the statements of fact published in the
preBS of Sunday they deal entirely in person
alities. So completely have they been cap
tured by prejudice, malice and hate that they
have entirely lost sight of the question at Issue
and contented themselves with abusing Brother
P. â¢ H. McCarthy, member of Union 22, presi
dent of the Bulletins "Trades Council, and dele
gate f> the District Council.
Brother McCarthy is in all matters apper
taining to his office guided solely and alone by
the wish of the majority, and in this instance
of an overwhelming majority. ! II follows then
that anything those disturbing gentlemen may
have to say about P. H. McCarthy only teruLs
to redound to his credit, because the same ele
ment for the past nine or ten years have en
deavored to disrupt, destroy and upset every
thing that has been brought about with a view
to more solidly placing those engaged in the
building business in the position which right
fully belongs to them. ij'Z'-l
This council by unanimous vote on last Sat
urday nieht issued a statement, which state
ment was based upon facts, and anything
those gentlemen might say to the contrary will ,
have no effect on the carpenters or other trades
In the bulldlnsr business. .- This council reiter
ates Its position, namely, that the mechanics
working on the buildings or engaged in the
building industry will -carry the Building
Trades Council's card and be by that council
guided solely and alone, without any lnteMer*
ence from any outside central body not an in
tegral Dart of the building industry. -.' Â¦
-.The article in yesterday's press says It is
not the wish of the carpenters of this district
to do Â«o. This District Council again brands
that as absolutely false and warns those gen
tlemen who are engaged Â¦ in spreading \ these
falsehoods and trying to non-uniontze the car
penters of this district that the day of reckon
ing is not far off, and that unlees they cease
their endeavor to destroy the harmonious rela
tions now existing in the ' building â¢ business
trouble to them- is sure to come; that the Dis
trict Council speaks the sentiments of the enor
mous majority of the carpenters in this dis
trict, and that no matter who comes or goes,
whether he be a delegate from the East or
from the West. from, the North or from/the
South, if he is not absolutely in favor of the
Building Trades Council conducting its busi
ness harmoniously, free and Independent of any
entangling alliances, he will not. be counte
nanced by this, the District Council of Sau
Francisco. And the best illustration of that
lies In the fact that the entire membership zt
the buildins trades, . with the exception of a:
few, forty or fifty at most, pretty much all
carpenters are now and have always been
strictly in favor of conducting the buildirsr
business on the same lines and through the
same channels as the Building Trades Council
has been conducting it under its constitution.
The assertion that P. H. McCarthy was elim
inated from the settlement of the baseball
grounds controversy is absolutely false . and
without foundation In fact, since those inter
ested signed the original agreement drawn up
by the Â¦ board of arbitration agreed upon by
Brother P. H. McCarthy In behalf of_ the Build
ing Trades Council to the exclusion of. the La
bor Council's directors." who tried to steal the
work of the Building Trades Council as accom
plished' In: the -winning of the mlllnaen'a eight
hour day. !
One word to those gentlemen who would try
to make this a personal matter and this council
is through, at least until it hears from those
few disturbers again. Now as to what Brother
McCarthy has done. In January. 1881, Brother
P. H. McCarthy, in conjunction with Brother
P. '3. McGuire and five others, In the city of
St. Louis started the movement which "In the
city . of Chicago on August 12 of the same
year resulted In .flie bringing about of a con
vention, at which? convention the Brotherhood
of Carpenters and Joiners was Instituted. This
is what Brother P. H. McCarthy and fifty or
sixty others now located in this city and county
have done.- Messrs. Gordon and Burke to the
contrary notwithstanding. In 1892 Brother P. H.
McCarthy was elected president of Local Union
No. 22. At that time Union No. 22 had 150
members In good standing. Union 483 thirty
seven, and In the entire State of California not
Â¦ more than 300 members were enrolled under the
banner of our organization.
Through the energy, skill and tact displayed
by Brother McCarthy and the other members
who .assisted him the organization has. from
that, time to this, steadily gone up. Union 22
having over one 'thousand members and the
other unions not In contempt of the Building
Trades Council numerically strong In propor
tion, and San Francisco one of the best or
ganized cities In the United States.- conducting
Its business through the most buslnesa-Uke
channels of any city In the Union, endeavoring
at "all. times to â¢ take care of the contractor,
owner and genera} public, as well as the jour
neyman. And through those same channels
Brother McCarthy and the thousands of other
men working with him have. In every depart
ment of the city government, where mechanics
are employed, gained for the organization the
placing of union men, and to their credit may
it be said- that in a great many instances have
these men competed for their positions by tak
ing examinations that are open, competitive,
public and free, and by their â¢ superior ability
have proven themselves worthy of the trust and
confidence reposed In them by the city authori
ties. For all this Brother McCarthy, : and the
thousands of other union men In the bulldiitg
Industry who fought hard to bring those laws
about, is now only worthy of the scorn and
contempt of such gentlemen as Messrs. Gor
don^ Burke and others, none of whom have at
any time done one Jot or tittle to improve the
condition of their fellow men.
: Finally, Mr. Editor, this District Council is,
as we have eald before, the District Council of
, this district.- It is going to continue to be
such. It will run the business of this district
In harmony with the constitution pf the' Build
ing Trades Council, which Is designed to pro
mote the greatest* good to the greatest number
engaged in the building business, regardless of
what any one may Bay to the contrary, no
matter where he cornea. from, or who" he Is. Â¦

In connection with the strained rela
tjons existing between Union No. 483 of
the Carpenters and Joiners and P, H.
McCarthy of the Building Trades j Coun
cil the following communication has been
received by The Call from the District
Council of Carpenters and Joiners:
The war in, the boss camp should not
divert the attention of the anti-boss Re
publicans from the real issue of the cam
paign. The Idea is uppermost in the
minds of the people that the delegates to
the Republican State Convention should
not be tied hard and fast to any sort of
a programme. It is as clear as the light
of day that the Herrin-Crimmins pro
grairirr.e is in the interest of Gage's re
nomination. There are no indications that
Burns, Kelly and Ruef will put forward
the slightest resistance to such a scheme.
Moreover, ii is obvious that Gage lis plac
ing his chief reliance for renomination on
the support of delegations representing
San Francisco Assembly districts. The
bosses would be pleased to settle the con
test before the convention meets. The
people would rather have the battle
fought out on the floor of the convention.
Republican voters who want to score a
Â§arty triumph at the pells and keep the
tate in the Republican column strongly
favor the proposition of electing delegates
Â¦who will not take orders from any of the
bosses.
Delegates Should Be Free.
Under the operation of the primary
election law the County Committee may
not be able to render material seri-ice to
the bosses in the approaching campaign,
yet the Republicans of the district are not
inclined to submit without protest to such
representation on the committee as the
bosses may see fit to give them. The in
dependents are not going into the strug
gle with the belief that victory can be
easily won. They know that the machine
politicians are working day and night to
capture district delegations.
At the present time there is war in the
boss councils over the distribution of mu
nicipal spoils. Burns threatens to drive
Crimmins out of the Republican party,
and Herrin, on the quiet, extends sympa
thy and support to Crimmins. Martin
Kelly, the boldest, if not the shrewdest,
of the bosses is supporting Burns in the
latter/s efforts to punish Crimmins. A.
Ruef 1 s not conspicuous, but is lending
passive support to the Burns-Kelly end
of the fight. He is waiting to hear what
tune will be played on Mayor Schmitz's
Sddle. Independent Republicans are not
losing sight of the main fact that the
bosses now at war can easily come to
gether after the delegates to the' State
Convention have been chosen. v
War in Boss Councils.

The Independent Republican Club of
the Forty-eeeond district, George R.
"Wells, president, will hold a meeting at
Saratoga Hall this evening. Republican,
citizens of this district entertain the be
lief that Andrew Louderback, 'who was
recently appointed county commltteeman
at large, is a machine politician, who will
look to the bosses for orders. He is not
regarded as a fit representative of the in
dependent Republican citizenship of the
Forty-sepond district. State Senator Jack
Tyrrell Is also rated as a machine politi
cian who is always ready and willing to
carry out the boss programme. It is the
impression that Thomas D. Riordan, An
drew Louderback ana Jack Tyrrell are
planning to send a boss delegation from
this district to the Republican State Con
vention. The republican citizens of the
district desire that their representatives
shall go to -the convention iree and un

STOCKTON, March 10.â A memorial to
Congress, petitioning that body to make
an appropriation of $255,816 for dredging
a diverting canal to preserve the naviga
tion of the San Joaquin River, was adopt
ed by the Stockton Chamber of Commerce
this evening. The memorial, after setting
forth the necessity of keeping the San
Joaquin River open to navigation, asserts
that the river for fifteen or twenty miles
below Stockton is navigable only for nat
bottomed steamboats of small draught,
by. reason of the shoals which are yearly
deposited by small streams emptying into
*hat section of the river. The proposed
diverting canal is intended to take the
waters of sloughs and small streams
where they are encountered east of Stock
ton, carry them around the city and
empty them into the San Joaauin River
thirty miles below this city, where the
stream is so deep and broad that ttu>
debris would do little if any damage.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
The Kona Sugar Company failure 13 the
only one of the kind that has occurred
here. The stock is largely held locally,
and there is much interest in the event
ual outcome. Expensive labor troubles
and a tight money market are the causes,
as the plantation la understood to be In
such condition that it could eventually
prosper if tided over the present difficulty.
The petition for an order to sell the
property was denied by Judga Hum
phreys, as it was opposed by ail parties
interested. The Judge authorized the re
ceiver to take such steps and employ such
assistance as Is necessary to preserve the
property. In the meantime the Creditors,
stockholders and agents of the Kona
Sugar Company are trying to make an
arrangement whereby the plantation can
be worked and the crop of sugar mar
keted.
After his appointment the receiver made
a trip to Ivona to look over the situation
in company with a member of the firm
of Brewer & Co., the firm having under
consideration a proposition to loan (200.0C9
to the plantation to carry It along until
the crop Is harvested, when it is thought
the plantation would be out of difficulty.
The arrangement fell througn, however,
and after trying to secure the money else
where -Wundenbcrg decided that the
plantation must be closed down and all
the property sold at once. Manager
James Cowan has written to the receiver
to the effect that if something Is not
quickly done to satisfy: the Japanese there
is danger of serious trouble with them.
They have been holding meetings and
acting in a threatening manner. '4 he men
are practicany destitute, and It is said
that they have. not been paid their wages
for four or five months past. A few days
ago they called on the manager in a body
and demanded from him written state
ments of the amounts due them. Cowan
asks that the Japanese Consul at Hono
lulu be asked to use his influence to con
vince the men that they will have their
rights when the courts act. '
HONOLULU, March 3.â Fred Wunden
berg, who was recently appolntefl re
ceiver of the Kona plantation, to-day pe
titioned the First Circuit Court for an
order to sell the plantation, having failed
to get the money necessary to carry it
on. The refusal of local capitalists to
take up the proposition has developed a
serious situation' at Kona. where there
are hundreds of laborers clamoring for
pay due them and threatening ' to burn
the mill and set lire to the growing crop
of cane.' valued at about J200.QOO.

A patent when, issued !s a grant of land
with all of the rights Incident to common law
ownership. In addition to the land there is
the right to pursue such veins, lodes and ledges
Â«xtralaterally in caae they depart from the
perpendicular and extend beyond the side lines
of the claim.' The decree of the court below
Is affirmed.
The caae involves the Interesting Question
whether the owner of a mining claim, who has
a right to pursue beyond the side lines of his
claim a vein or lode which haa Us apex within
his own claim, la confined In bis route of ex
ploration within or upon the vein Itself and
is without authority to otherwise enter an ad
joining claim. There is no warrant for saying
that they have any general right of exploration
within land on an adjoining patented claim
whether upon or below the surface. The right
of exploration is given for the purpose of
makins discovery of mineral. Of what avail
would the risht of exploration be if no benent
could be obtained from discovery made there
by? The around covered by a subsisting valid
mineral location Is open to exploration only
by the owner thereof, fhe statute gives the
appellants the right to follow the vein whicli
they were seeking to reach by the tunnel, but
it confers upon them no right to approach it
from any point other than the vein or lode it
self.
Plaintiff Is owner of the St. Louis lode min
ing claim, and the Montana Mining Company
(limited) la the owner of the Nine Hour loue
mining claim. Appellant* were proceeding to
drift a tunnel 2(S0 feet underground horizon
tally trom the St. Louis claim eastward and
into the Nine Hour claim for the purpose oi'
reaching the minim.' lode which had Us apex
In the St. Louis claim and which they had >i
risht to pursue in lta downward course as it
passed from Its dip to the eastward wlthi:i
their aide lines into the Nine Hour claim. If
was stipulated that the tunnel, if projected hi
the course in which It was being drifted,
would reach a vein or lode which had Us apex
within the St. Louis claim and that In the
course of Its progress there would be encoun
tered no other vein, lode or ledge. The appel
lants were enjoined from proceeding with trie
work.

It Is an elementary proposition of law that
two or three offenses may not be joined in a
single count of an indictment. But ia the
Mains case the indictment was drawn up after
the" form of Indictment In the Baln-Alllson
case where a conviction followed. In this In
dictment three separate oftense3 were charged
and there was no objection. In quaahlng the
Mains indictment Judge d e Haven did not say
that the getting forth therein of two letters
in furtherance of a single scheme in one count
of the Indictment was equivalent to charging
two ofTenses. The opinions of the courts differ
on this question. In the case of Fleming, de
cided by United States District Judge Dlodgett
of Illinois, ten letters which bore upon the
alleged crime were specified In a single count.
The Indictment In the Mains case was not
drawn by me personally, but my responsibility
is not lessened onrfhat account, however.
As regards the charge that I visit the race
course during business hours I have only to
say that It Is untrue. I do not visit the race
track and to ehargu that I persistently Ignore
my duties Is manifestly unjust. I can gay
that many nights I have worked until Jl
o'clock, but no one found fault with me for
that. We have the work of the ofnVe well in
hand and there was no valid reason for' the
statement that the work of the office was being
neglected.
One noticeable result of the publication
of the facts was the, unusual appearance
in the ofllce of Assistants Banning and
McKlnlay as early as 9 a. m. The fact
that Banning was seen to enter the Fed
eral building at that untimely hour was
Immediately telegraphed from office to
ofllce, so that within ten minutes every
man having business In the building was
aware of it, and all marveled exceedingly.
Assistant Banning, who drew up tho
indictment in the case of Chanes K.
Mains, charged with using the mails for
fraudulent purposes, and which was
quashed by Judge de Haven on the
ground that it was imperfectly drawn,
said yesterday that the statement of
Judge de Haven In quashing the indict
ment was imperfectly reported. He re
sumed:
The exposure by The Call of the laxity
with which business Is conducted In the
office of United States Dlatrlct Attorney

lead to an ofllclal investigation by tha

a sensation in legal circles yesterday.

TOO GREAT EXPENSE
Not the Reason.
It is not because Pyramid Pile Cure 13
80 expensive that many people decline â¢Â¦>
give It Â»i trial, but becuuse they find it
too great a tax on their credulity to be-
lieve that the published letters bearing
testimony to tho merit of this remedy
are genuine and bona fide; especially to
those -who have realized the suffering In-
cident to piles 13 It Incredible that any
one who has been afflicted twenty-flve
and thirty years with the worst forms of
protruding and bleeding piles should be
cured by the application of a simple rem-
edy, when their physician has assured
i them that the only relief is In a surgical
operation. This Is rightfully viewed with
dread by all those afflicted, as it means\
at the least a great shock to the nervous J
system, with more than a possibility or
utter collapse and death; In the majority
of cases, too, there Is a return ef tho
complaint, owing to the fact that the
cause is not removed.
The proprietors of Pyramid Pile Cur*
agree to forfeit one thousand dollars to
any one who will show a single published
testimonial to be not genuine and unso-
licited; this latter feature is most gratify-
ing, inasmuch as these letters are writ-
ten solely out of gratitude, and with the
hope that those who are afflicted as the
writers have been may learn that relief
is at hand, at a comparatively trifling ex-
pense. Pyramid Pile Cure Is for sale by
druggists at 30 cents a package, or will
be mailed by tae makers to any address
upon receipt of price.
Mr. Wm. Llchtenwalter, head of the
largest printing house In Canton. Ohio,
says: "It is with the utmost pleasure
and, satisfaction that I can say I believe
I am cured of protruding and bleediug
piles, after suffering more than twenty-
flve years. I have been in bed for two
weeks at a time. I havo not suffered In
the least for over a year, and I used only
three SO-ccnt boxes of Pyramid Pile Cure.
I advise every person suffering with thl3
distressing and painful complaint to givÂ«
this remedy a trial. I have every confi-
dence In It." Write the Pyramid Drug
Company, Marshall, Mich., for their book
on the causes and cure of piles.

See "Psycho" taken from its box and placed in

Is it a human being or a wax figure ? That is the question
that wjll bs asked by hundreds of people here in San Francisco
this afternoon when they witness the strange sight in Sherman;
Clay & Co.'s show windows, -v 1
In front of an Angelus Piano Player, which is attached to a
Steinway Grand Piano, will aopear what seem? to be a'wax figure
performing on the Angelus. Some people.will declare that it is a
man, but to offset this, the fact exists that the figure, or whatever
it is, sits before the Angelus for two hours and never twitches a
face muscle or winks an eyelid. The feet will pump the .pedals,"
the hands will work the steps and the head will jsrk rrom one, side,
to the other at regular intervals of ten seconds, ks performance,
is wonderful and mystifying. It se?ms to be more than an autc
maton, yet the glassy stare to its eyes and the jerky movement of
its head and arm. for two hours continuously dispels the thought
that it is human.
The wonder is "Psycho," the musical mvstery of London,
Pan's and New York. Sherman, Clay & Co. nave specially, im-
ported "Psycho" to give this marvelous exhibition.
"Psycho" will -appear in the >how window and perform on
the Angelus daily between the hours of 3 and 5.30 in the after-
noons and 7.30 and 9 in the evenings. ."'%(..*
Look in Sherman, Clay & Co.'s windows to-day after three
o'clock and see if you can tell whether "Psycho" is- a man or
automaton. .-j. i'-i
