FROM EMPEROR WILLIAM
ROME, March 6.â The Pope 'to-day re
ceived a number of extraordinary mis
sions sent to congratulate him â¢ on his
jubilee. They brought costly gifts and
autograph letters from the heads of. the
states they represented. Emperor Wil
liam sent in a porcelain clock. His
Holiness, in thanking the German envoy,
referred to the friendship existing be
tween Germany and the Vatican, and
said he congratulated himself on the good
relations existing between Emperor Wil

Husband's Stranga Passing.
"Walsh never reappeared, and the deso
late, wife firmly believed up to the time
of her sad death that he had met with foul
play. When he left the little home he
carried with him a considerable sum of
money with which to pay part of Â» the
mortgage. '
Mrs. Walsh worked- hard after the
mysterious passing of. her hushand and
contrived to pay off the debt on her
home and to maintain herself in com
parative comfort*
There have been suggestions that the
woman was murdered before the blaze
started, but this can hardly be deter
mined unless a fracture of the skull is
discovered by the autopsy surgeon, this
being about, the only portion in the re
mains not charred beyond recognition.
The inquest will be held to-morrow. ; '

iL-^ â¢â¢You know I live alone.,
'^^fek There are reasons why I. am
/l Jh puspioious of certain persons.;
h| ' . Now, if anything happens to
me. please have my cruci
fixes buried with me."* â¢ â¢
This was the strangely significant state
ment made a short time ago . by Mrs.
3Â£ary Walsh, the aged woman who per
ished In the Incendiary fire that destroyed
her home here last night.
The remark was addressed to an inti
mate triend of Mrs. Walsh and was not
fceriously considered at the time. But
vlien associated with the positive evi
dence of the crime of arson, the indica
tions of robbery and the probability that
inurder was committed In the house be
fore the torch began Its destruction, it
has furnished material of sensational im
port.
â¢ POLICE OFFICIALS ACTIVE.
The police authorities have been busy
a.il day in a search for the murderer, who,
it is confidently believed. Is a member of
the gang of firebugs and burglars that
has- terrorized this section of the county
for many months. The officers have so
far been unsuccessful, and their investi
gation of the premises has afforded them
iiothing very tangible in the nature of a
clew.
The fire was discovered half an hour
before midnight and an alarm. was given
â¢with all promptitude, but not .early
enough to enable the department to save
the light wooden dwelling. The woman's
l>edroom was entered, however, but she
Â¦was not found there. Subsequently \ her
partly burned body was located near the
rear^door, through which she had evi
dently endeavored to escape.
EVIDENCE OF ROBBERY.
The Coroner of Marin County made an
txamlnation of the premises early -this
ttxreing'. Between the mattresses on
Mrs. Walsh's bed-he found a purse and
a small cloth sack containing altogether
?2J0 in gold coin. _There were a few coiii3
of small denomination scattered about on
a bureau, and on the flodr of the room
was an empty sack similar in size and
appearance to that fouYid under the mat
tress. It is -thought that this latter sack
may have been emptied by some Intruder,'
v.ho afterward fired the building "to de
stroy evidence of. his crime. .' '."
The bed clothing was In disorder, indi
cating that Mrs. Walsh had retired some
time after her attendance at the Catho
lic church early in the evening. On ono
of the chairs was a brass dinner bell and
a police whistle, -articles which seem to
lend additional color to the theory that
the elderly woman had doubts about her
safety. There were many papers in the
loom, but they, contain nothing of im
portance to aid the police.
SHERIFF pN A TRAIL.
At an early hour this morning Sheriff
Taylor mounted a fast horse and started
on a ride which may have a result In the
apprehension of the incendiary. The
Sheriff: did not make known the cause- of
his sudden departure, but it is safely
conjectured that he is in possession of
Important information as to the Identity
and whereabouts of the miscreant who
committed the double crime/
The husband. of Mrs. Walsh .was. a
sailor, who with his wife came- here
many years ago and purchased a house
on Trainor street; paying part cash and
taking a mortgage for the balance. Walsh
was a young man then, and proposed to
quit , the sea and reside here Â¦ permanently!,
He obtained employment, and worked
conscientiously for a'short time.,. "
Then" came a morning,, but Walsh
didn't come with it. His employers wait

marveled . as much as they did, for she
had not seen her husband for a couple of
days.

by, his manner and pushed a bottle of soOa
water -toward him. hcplnc he would take it ar*l
leave. He. asked. "Where Is yours?" I ealJ.
"Why, I -don't, care for any^; and a look

Just then a girl came Into ths bakery and tho

Mrs. Falkenberg had sent Maud to a
bakory run by Mrs. Mary Thompson at
Eighteenth and .Noe streets about 8
o'clock. The little boys went with , her.
Mrs. Thompson cautioned her^ to hurry
home, as she had seen a man who had
been in the bakery half an hour before
still loitering on the other side of the
street. In a few moments the child came
back, hatless and weeping hysterically
and said that the man had tried to choke
her and had chased her down the street.

Special Dispatch to The .Call.
'BERLIN, March 6.â The Call's corre
spondent is informed from a trustworthy
source that the ultimate object of Prince
Henry's visit to Washington is to bring
about an agreement;. by which' Germany
will be permitted to maintain a large
fleet in Caribbean waters to serve for the
protection of German settlers and prop
erty rights imperiled by frequent revolu
tions in South American republics. In
official correspondence "the fleet of Ger
man warships assembled at La Guayra
is styled as that of an American sta
tion.
Captain Siege of the -Vineta has just
received the title of commodore, and will
be commander of the South American
fleet, henceforth flying his own ensign.
Although the fleet was sent to Vene
zuela ouly for the enforcement of the
rights guaranteed to German capital and
interests, it alread-y consists of five ves
sels, and it is intended to steadily increase
this number.
A difficult issue Is the. acquisition of a
repair dock and coaling:, .station. The
hope is entertained here that no objection
will be made to the maintenance of the
fleet in the West Indies because it is in
tended to be entirely for defensive pur
poses and not to acquire territory.
NO COVEHT DESIGNS.
; It is claimed that the representations
of Prince Henry and Embag?ado^ i .von,
Holleben l Kave'"ObhvihVecl~thT r bnic:aisTat
Washington that- no covert designs -are
entertained. 'Protection is desired espe
cially because the Berlin Government now
undertakes the task of directing the Ger
man migration movement to South
America. Heretofore the work had been
performed by the Hanseatic League and
Colonial, sections. The bureau is at the
home office, of which Count von Bulow
is the ex-ofllcio presiding officer. It is
mainly intended to induce German emi
grants to settle in German colonies, or if
they cannot be induced to g'o there, to
settle in South America, where home tics
are still preserved. The director of this
bureau was for many years a' Consul
General in South America, and was i spe
cially choKcn for this task.
Jt is stated that the German financiers
who conotructcd the Vc'riozuokin railway,
which is the subject of pending ncgot a
lions between Germany and President
Caatro'8 Government, am anxious to dis
pose of their property to American Inves
tors.
Theso financiers are represented in New-
York by Kuhn, Locb & Co., The claim is
made that Germany ia not in a position
to offer adequate protection to German
capital and investment In South America
and that the Great Northern Venezuelan'
Railway might fare bettor in tho hands
of United States capitalists.
CHANGE IN GERMAN , POLICY.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March Câ No
objection will be made by this Govern
ment to the maintenance by Germany. .of
the fleet in American waters, but there
would be decided' opposition to her ac
quisition of a coaling and repair station
in the Western Hemisphere.
If tho ultimate object of Prince Hen
ry's visit be the acquisition of a. coaling
station in American waters, then there
has been officially a distinct change in the
policy of the German Government. When
Embassador von Hplleben returned last
November from his visit to Berlin he
called -upon President Roosevelt and
gave him the most positive assurances
that Emperor William had no intention
of extending German sovereignty over a
portion 'of the Western Hemisphere. After
his call upon President Roosevelt the
Embassador made a statement to The
Call correspondent, in the course of which
he said: ' .
"I de-sire to state emphatically that
Germany has never for an instant enter
tained the idea of establishing her sov
ereignty over any territory in this hem
isphere, and the attitude of my Govern
ment establishes that no such design will
ever be contemplated."
At the same time the United States au
thorities have never lost sight' of the pos
sibility of German acquisition of a naval
station in American waters. It was to
prevent any embarrassments arising that
the- United," States purchased the Danish
West Indies.

Immediately added: "No offense to you "
Addressing himself to Putnam, ho then
added: "It is meant for the welfare of

When the Prince and President Eliot
had met Professor nnd Mrs. Munsterberg
they were conducted into . the library,
where stood Henry W. Putnam, chairman
of the board of directors of the Germanic

within fifty years have bo marvelously changed

Our whole people have the profoundest sym
pathy with the unification of Germany. .We
all believe in a great union of federated states,
bound together by a common language, by

In watching the social and ethnological phe

the largtrt contribution which a European poo

many, and that the German quota was not only
the moct numerous, but the best educated.
This occasion is unique. Twice in the his
tory of the university has a special academic
session been held to do honor to the President
of the United -States, making a progress
through the country, but never before lias this
democratic university been called together on
purpose to do honor to a foreign l'rince.

-soldiers had adopted what he called "evi

during his experience in command in tho
Philippines he had not been confronted
by anything of the kind. The- policy of,
the army, he said, was most humane.
He continued:
This appears to be revenge for tho massacn*
of the Ninth Infantry. Of course it is all

BERLIN, March 6.â The directors of
the Sugar Manufacturers' Union, repre

drafted a petition to the Government re
o.uesting. that linal legislative steps as a
result of the Brussels sugar agreement
be not taken until the sugar Interests
have an opportunity of presenting a full
statement of their claims. ' .
l<'or the moment the question of first
importance in Germany is ,.the adhesion

sugar convention which was signed at
Brussels yesterday.
The Spectacle of the sugar kartels'

year, deliquescing Into nothingness, fas
cinates this immense community of money
makers. It has not by any means come to
the point of the downfall of the kartel,
as the combination of 400 raw and lifty
three reilned sugar manufacturers is
called, 4)ut the sugar Interest, deeply af
fecting as it does the agriculture of Cen

fearful of what may happen. â¢ -
The position of the Government Is that
nothing will happen except a healthy re
adjustment of production for the market
at home and abroad. 'â¢ " : â¢ ' Â¦ â¢
The National Society of Sugar Produ
cers seems inclined to resist the necessary
legislation.
The managers of the kartel are silent,
but If is quite probable they will yield to
the Government and to' the Irresistible
circumstances abroad.
Dr. Paaschc, the great sugar authority,
says that sugar producers are facing enor

on August 1, he says, will be at least 2,

within Its lines in Manila previous to the
arrival. of the American forces, Patterson
referred to the surrender of 3000 Spanish
troops to the Insurrectory force In July
1898.. General Hughes said the Incident
would only make him believe that tho
, Filipinos had cut off the supplies from the

MONTEREY, March 6.â One of the
most remarkable celebrations of
a half-century of wedded life
ever recorded in this county
Miss Mamie Walker, nnother nurse,
was positive Ed had never threatened his
mother with a club. She stated further
Mrs. Piercy had never charged her. with
setting fire to tho house on King street.
This ended the testimony. In the after
noon Judge Hyland, accompanied by the
stenographer, visited Mrs. Piercy in. her
room in the Stanford House. On recon
vening court the Judge did not make pub
lic his interview, further than to say
that the last words Mrs. Piercy said to
him was that if he appointed a guardian
ho had better make his will.
Mrs. Smith stated that Mrs. Plercy had
told her to keep Andrew and his family
away from her. She said Mrs. Plercy
had .been well taken care of and was
surrounded by every comfort, and /while
she was with her Ed had never brought
whisky to the house for his mother. Sha
thought Ed's manner toward his mother
kind. and affectionate. '
Mrs. Smith, who attended Mrs. Plercy
for six years, was another witness.- She
said that Andrew Plercy during his visits
to his. mother was boisterous q.nd he al
ways, wanted money. On one occasion
when he called the witness wns out of
the room, but hearing Mrs. Plercy scream
she rushed in, when the old lady told her
Andrew had pointed a pistol at her. Mrs.
Piercy was excited, and asked Mrs.
Smith to make Andrew show her the pis
tol. Witness did not see the weapon,
howeveu.
General Barnes said he knew of no
reason why the deed, giving, the property
to Edward Piercy was not recorded until
December, although It was executed last
March. He had -told E. L. Rhodes some
time before to record the deed and sup
posed he had done so.
Mrs. Andrew Plercy asked permission to
question General Barnes, which was
granted. After she finished General
Barnes made an explanation of some of
his J remarks.
General Barnes stated that he had act
ed as the/adviser'of Mrs. Mary Pifercy for
years. In an opinion formed from inter
views with Mrs.- Piercy. it was her firm
intention: that Â¦ Edward Piercy should
Jiave her property, and subsequent to her
making the deed whereby she gave Ed
ward some $30,000 worth of property, Mrs.
Piercy had told her daughter, Mrs. Mar
tel, thaf. the act -was- free and uninflu
enced on her partrAOn one occasion when
the witness â¢- had called on Mrs. Piercy
Andrew Piercy was present, and he had
requested General Barnes to leave. The
witness said Mrs. Pierey's mental condi
tion was as good as that of any person
in the courtroom. He did not believe a
guardian was necessary in her case. Her
property was in excellent hands, he said, 1
and does not require investments that in
volve any great degree of ability. He be
lieved that were the court to pronounce
Mrs. Piercy insane it would kill her.
Mrs.*Piercy, who is*82 years of age, has
property iii; this county and San Fran

The facts are that Eell's operations In La

about Â¦ twenty-five miles from Manila In an
air line. A small band of Ladrones driven
from Cavlte by the constabulary Joined them.
Twenty-five constabularies, under native ser
geants, attacked them, but on account of hav
ing only fifteen rounds of ammunition each,
soon exhausted it and were forced to retira
without loss. Assistant Chief Atkinson of the
constabulary, with reinforcements, immediate
ly took change and drove the band, with l03S
to the latter. Into Laguna, the inhabitants oÂ£
Klzal province giving information and assist
ing us as much as possible.
; i Flortes (Governor of the province), with the
municipal police, is in pursuit. There are not
3uO arms in the hands of the Insurgents and
Ladrones in the entire Luzon island to-day.
The number was reduced early by .surrender*.
captures or casualties. The constabulary, wuh
the aid of Trias (Governor of Cavite) and na
tive police, during the last two weeks ha\ i
routed Ladrone bands existing in the island
for many years, capturing and receiving by
surrender over 100 arms.
The most important feature is the sentiment
among the Inhabitants hostile to the; Ladronca
and insurgents. All other organized provinces
are quiet. The situation has not be^n so good
since American occupation, and is very eu
couraging, notwithstanding the persistent at
tempts to create a contrary impression.
Governor Taft presented the dispatch to
the House Insular Committee to-day
when questioned on reported reverses.
Health Conditions Improve.
Surgeon General Sternberg to-day re
ceived the health report of the military
division of the Philippines for the monm
ending January 15 last. The percentas
of sick was 6.16 and the total sick 25U1
cases. There were 59 deaths during the
month; a decrease of eighteen, compared
with the previous month.
Colonel Pope, who made the report just
before his death, says the lower percent
age of sick and the few deaths are espe
cially gratifying in view of active mili
tary operations of the most arduous char
acter In Samar and Batangas. The sit
uation In regard to bubonic plague is
much more favorable than at the time of
the last report. Only three cases of the
disease occurred during the month, ana
being Harry Dunn, a quartermaster's em
ploye, who died December 27.

TO THE JUDGE
PEKING, March 6.â Chinese officials
fear that - the refusal of the Bankers'
Commission to accept the February ln "
stallment of the indemnity"' will render
the; collection of future installments more
difficult. Sir Robert Hart, director of the
imperial maritime customs, used every
argument of persuasion to impress the
viceroys of the various provinces with the
importance ot promptly contributing their
share to the indemnity. "When it becomes
known- that -the l,b20,u00 taels of the Feb
ruary, installment is lying in the Chinese
bans because the foreign governments are
unable to agree' to terms concerning its
division; the Chinese will possibly relax
their, eit'orta to. meet the future install
ments.
Sir Robert Hart sent letters to-day to
the Ministers of the powers here calling
their attention to the complications likely
to result if the money, which is deposited
in the Chinese Bank at Shanghai, should
bo "destroyed or diverted."

For a moment it looked as if several in
terior towns would be minus their Chiefs
of Police, but fortunately the scuppers of
the tug were large and the water drained
off rapidly, giving the officials a secure
anchorage on the wet deck of the tug or
a safe hold on any old thing they grabbed
in desperation to keep from being washed
overboard.
When the big wave washed over the
Markhfim, Chief Sullivan of Sacramento,
Chief Hodgkiris of Oakland, Chief Rey
nolds of Butte, Captain Spillane, Detective
Gibson, Captain Dunleavy, Chief Stanford
of Valiejo, and several others, were en
joying a smoke and swapping police
reminiscences on the stern. They did not
have time to get out of the way. , . The
water enxeloped the bright stars of police
dom in drenching night and toppled them
all over the deck. Chief Hodgkins looked
Now, yesterday was a rather bad day
for corn-fed Chiefs of Police from the in
terior towns to take their llrst lessons in
bay navigation. . When the tug got oppo
site Fort Point, a big sea piled aboard of
her and in a jiffy about ten Chiefs of
Police, two Captains ronnected with the
local force and a detective or two were
given an unnecssary bath and incidentally
a fright that will send them back home
with the distinct realization that thy
heads off the harbor are a bit more tur
bulent than the variety they might be
used to waking up with in the morning.
CHIEF OF POLICE WITTMAN
took tho visiting Chiefs on a,
tug ride arottnd the bay yes
terday. He piled all *orts of
refreshments, liquid and other
wise, aboard the State tug Governor
Markham, and everything went us merry
ns a wedding breakfast until the party,
at the latter end of the excursion, Was
taken out as fax as. the heads. ; .
John Peters, it is said, was well played
at -Hot Springs on Wednesday, with the
Hongkong and Calcutta poolrooms yet to
oe heard from.
As. long as Tommy Burns has> got
started and is telling the New Orleans
critics how bad the game out here Is,' he
might also relate to them the tale of how
he got beaten on Artilla. That -would
make interesting reading matter, too.
For reference: "Dope book," race 3055, date
December 28-Suneflo, 4 to 1, won; Artilla,
4 to 5, 'second. Â¦
The Bell stakes for two-year-olds, to be
run to-morow, will be one of the most
open events of the season. All of the
best youngsters In training will face the
barrier and there is not apt to be any pro
nounced choice. An elegant silver punch
bowl, valued at $500, donated by L. V.
Bell, the New York turfman, goes to the
fortunate owner, of the winner along with
the stake m,oney.
Lee Jackson is gradually recovering
from the effects of winning tho Burns
handicap, for he piloted two winners yes
terday, and finished second on Ned Den

All in all , the bay eutlng wag a great
jtuccewi.v Aside from tho watting, Â¦ and
the jolly, pollca chiefs didn't mind that
the loantblt, everything' went off smooth-
Iy L ?!?Â° Markham left tho Mission-street
. wharf A about ii;so a. rn. and steamed to
- Hunters Point, where the party inspect
ed the.drydock under tho guldancu of
Chief Wittrnan. On leaving Hunters
â¢JHoint.the party indulged in light refresh
ments. The' lunch was nicely put up and
everybody enjoyed it. The next stop
ping-place was- Goat Island, where tho
entire party became the guests of Cap
tain MoSier, -who showed them all over,
'the training ship Pensncola and the
training scHool on the island. On leav
,ing there the Markham went to . Alca
traz, where another landing was made.
They were piloted over the Island by Cap
tain Fuller. . who showed them through
the military prison and over the ether
interesting portions of the island. Then
the Markham turned her nose toward
.the Golden Gate. The visiting chiefs en
joyed the -beautiful view passing out
through the, straits. In fact they enjoyed
every feature of the trip until that- big
wave came aboard and dampened their
ardor and incidentally their clothes.
:. On the way back the tug circled Angel
Island, then headed for home. At the
dock the visiting chiefs and all those
who. enjoyed Chief Wittman's hospitality
voted the bay outing a success.
Those who were aboard the tug were:
Chief Wittman,. Chief S. C. Hodgkins of
Oakland. Chief J. E. Sullivan of Sacra
mento. Chief J. A. Kidward of San Jose,
Chief T. D.' Briare of Stockton, ex-Chief
J. D. Gall of Stockton, Chief C- A. El
ton of Los Angeles, Chief J. D. Morgan
and wife of Fresno, Chief * J. M. Reynolds
and wife of Butte,. Mont., Chief Conrad
of Alameda, Chief Rawle of Santa Cruz,
Chief W. F. Stanford of Valiejo, Cap
tain John Spillane, Captain Dunleavy
and Detective Ed Gibson.
San Jose's. Chief and Captain Witt
man were up in the pilot-house
with the ladies of the party whil6
the roller was pickling the other of
ficials. Chief Kidward braced himself
against the lurch of the boat and said he
had sailed Alvlso Slough too often to
mind .any t such slight agitation of the
waters. Two 1 minutes later he became Im
bued with the theory that Bennett had
committed suicide by drowning and began
searching for his body- over the rail
down near the waves.
When the tug lurched under the weight
cf the sea, both Chief Hodgkins and
Chief Sullivan took a high. dive Into the
seething wateYs on the deck from their
perch on the flagstaff of the tug. Hodg
];ins came out of the mess hooked up to
the shoulderstrap of a newspaper man's
camera. It looked as if ; he was posing
before the instrument as a model of a
police chief In distress. Chief Sullivan
paid he felt wet Inside and out. Those
who didn't adjourned at once to the re
freshment cubby-hole and proceeded to
dampen that portion of their anatomy
that the sea didn't reach.
Chief Conrad of Alamoda wound up
with his arm around- a, 10-inch hawser,
and he said afterward that it didn't seem

. S the date for the deciding of the
J\ Thornton four-mile statr.e ap
, /\\ proaches, Saturday, March 15,
vt\\ keen interest is beginning to be
evinced in this event. In a sort
of preliminary over one and three-quar
ter, miles at Oakland yesterday three of
the candidates for the long distance race
met. Slddons, the four-year-old sen of
Wadsworth and Modjeska, and a prime
favorite in the betting, defeated .Black
Dick in cakewalk fashion. The last
named horse, ridden by Johnny Woods,
went out to make the pace with good
intentions, but was passed early by the
winner, piloted by Lee Jackson. CHd
Dorian, with Winnie O'Connor on his
back, ran like a two-year-old for three
quarters of a mile, and then began mak
ing an exit. Unless the ancient piecu of
racing material develops much greater
staying qualities he will not cut much of
a fleure in the Thornton,
Jealous, no doubt, of the wide swath
cut by long uhota the flay before, fa
vorite* took to the eluehy going like a
Cuek to tha water, capturing every race
on the card. The attendance wa* Urge,
many no doubt expecting to Â«ee anuther
army of outsiders parade past the wire
iJlackthern, from the Burns & Water
house stable, was ft starter In the open
ins live and a half furlenÂ« scramble,
unit by many waa cotwldowd a supposed
SSod thing. The biaek gelding made a
?Air Mhowfnir. but at tha wire -.wait, led
out a fcÂ£g th by Derby Winner, which
hnrÂ«o clotipd a slight fuvorite In the bet
ting, A? tlr leading for a time, Oratossa
the speed of'the.elgh.t start
erÂ« in tho six-furlong spin. Quiz* li, pi
loted by Koacoe Troxlcr, scored an easy
win. The St. Plorlttn gelding ruled a :: to
2 favorite, and after making all the run
ning passed the Judges four lengths be
fore Bassenzo. Foul Play, after trailing
tho leader, lost the place by a head.
Light-weighted Legal Maxim, equal
favorite in the betting with Cougar cap
tured the mile selling event. Johnny
Daly took the three-year-old out in front
at the start, and though somewhat ex
tended at the close, downed Cougar a.
length Billy Lyons, at 30 to 1, ran into
the show, ahead of Courtier.
Of course, with the track made to or
der for the occasion, there was no beat
ing Duckoy in the six and a half -furlong
event. The Morris mudlark, a 2 to 5 fa
vorite, outfooted Dunblane on the back
stretch, winning in a gallop. Sweet Tooth
was an absentee, the show falling to
M Ru1lnp eaual favorite with Horton for
the tinal six-furlong run. Gusto displayed
an entire absence of speed and has ap
parently gone back. O'Connor brought
Horton on from last position, disposing of
Ned Dennis cleverly at the end. The lat
ter horse was extensively played for the
place. Gusto finished third. ,

carelessness.
Toward the end of the match Fairbanks
made each hole ia bogey. Playing sure
and strong as he was it was believed that
Lawson's chances were nil and this opin
ion was confirmed when the latter made
his. only poor drive of the day. Each man
went out in forty, which left Fairbanks
5 up and only 9 to go. At the thirteenth
hole Fairbanks holed out a long put for #
a 3, while Lawson took 4 and the match
and the championship went to the former,
7 up and 5 to play.
To-morrow the open championship com
petition, given by the Southern California
Golf Association, will commence at tha
Country Club. It will be seventy-two
holes, medal play. As all the noted pro

the State will participate some excellent
golf is assured.

LOS ANGELES, March 6.â Walter
Fairbanks, the Southern California ama
teur golf champion for 1901, went one step
higher to-day and won the championship
pt the Pacific Coast for 1902. In the final
match with John Lawson of San Fran
cisco Fairbanks secured the premier
championship by the score of 7 up, 6 to
play.
Another championship was decided to
dayâthat of the Southern California Golf
Associationâ when H. M. Sears won the
title by defeating J. E. Cook 7 up and 5
to play.
The greatest interest attached, to the
match between Fairbanks and La'wson
and it was followed by the spectators
morning and afternoon. Lawson won the
first hole by holding out a short ap
proach, a beautiful shot. This was the
only time he was up in the match, for his
opponent took the second and third and
was never less than 2 up until the end
of the game.
The morning round ended 4 up for
Fairbanks. At the twentieth hole both
Â¦were short in apDroach puts and Fair
bonks laid his tifth at the cup's rim.
Dawson had a four-foot put for the hole,
but instead of holding out struck his op
ponent's ball, knocking it in, and lost the

-It is claimed that, owing to the Increase of
work in the Recorder's o'flce. he was. under
section 12, authorized to employ extra persons,
whose demands should be paid out of the unap
portioned fee fund.
â¢ The one-twelfth act provides that it shall
not be lawful for any officer having power to
Incur liabilities against the treasury to incur
orj present in any one month any demand
against any- appropriation which taken with
the other expenditures or liabilities incurred
up to the time of making such demand shal'
exceed one-twelfth part of the amount of the
appropriation for the fiscal year.
. Under thl3 apportionment the Rocorder was
entitled to $1011 per month for copyists. There
are more than twenty copyists employed by the
Recorder. Their demands could not be paid
out of the general fund without violating the
one-twelfth act.
Judge Hunt yesterday sustained the de
murrer Interposed by City Attorney Lane
to the petition for a writ of mandate filed
by Edward L. O'Connor to compel the
Auditor to audit his demand for $100 for
extra services as a copyist, in the Re
corder's office. - O'Connor' was an j extra
copyist and claimed that he was entitled
to" compensation for, his services out of
the unapportioned fee fund.
Judge; Hunt, in deciding the case, said:
\\hen the official budget for the year was
adopted the, sum of $23,ouO was allowed out of
the general fund for the payment of copyists
in the Kecordcr'B office.

provisions of the charter, where the compen
sation ia not fixed by law. This is particularly
true of the appointees of the Auditor and of thi
Board of Health. If. therefore, the conten
tion of the petitioner were sustained, every em.
ploye of the municipality whose compensation
has not been established by law, but has been
determined by the appointing power can col
lect such compensation out of the "unappor
tloned fee fund." independent of the prov'.sior.a
of the one-twelfth act. This, in my opinion,
cannot be done.- The only inconvenience which
can result from the present situation is that
the party recording an Instrument may have
to -wait a little longer for its return. Relict
can be furnished in several ways.
The Recorder may, upon application to thÂ«
Board of Supervisors, obtain an allowance
from the urgent necessity fund, or he may se
cure relief under section So. article 16. of the
charter, which provides that when any official
shall require additional clerks or employe*,
application shall be made to the Mayor there

he may recommend the Supervisors to author

The Police Depsrlmcnt of San Fran

the victim of a hcax. The man taken for
"Kid" Goucher was Howard Bulkley. a
resident of this city and well known here.

Sat. Francirco at 9 o'clock in the morn

A df-rcription of the much-desired man
jitcompanied the merssse.
Arrangements were immediately mado
by the local police to locate the man and
1 rrvfnt his escape; Officers were fta
â¢,ii r<-d along the track outside of town,
fo that he would be unable to drop o.'f
the train before the city limits were
if nulled.
In 1K37 he left his home with a young
companion. The boys were caught at VI
salia and brought back to Fresno, but
Gorcher departed again and never re
turned. The picture gives an idea of the
shape of h's head and the contour of his
features. The short nose and thick lips
are still his prominent facial features.
Allan Goucher. better known as "Kid."

old. Is reproduced here, was born In
Frrsno twenty years ago. He lived there
until his fifteenth year, attending tha
giammar school and spending one year
in the high school. While in the high
school he looted a telephone box.
Bulkley was much surprised to hear
that he had been mistaken for the al
leged murderer of Policeman Robinson
and is congratulating himself that he was
not arrested in San Francsico. where he
l^ad been for several days. The mfstake
of the San Francisco police occasioned
much merriment here.
cept that he was better dressed than the
telephone . message would indicate. He
carried a basket, as stated in the informa

Bulkley has lived here for years. The

ley thru a mistake had been made.
"I thought the Senator and Morgan
were friends," replied Tillman.
Philippines the Key to the Orient.
"I know nothing about the purchase of
the Leyland line by J. P. Morgan & Co "
said Hanna, ""any more than the Senator
does. - That Is simply the investment of
American capital. Under the provisions
,of this bill not a single one of these, ves
sels ever will come under an American
register or an j American flag. Capital
seeks only investment from which it can
get returns."
"If that be true." inquired Tillman,
way did the German Emperor not ko
to England to get his yacht built, instead
of coming to this country?"
Hanna said there were some things he
could not answer, but he thought Prince
Henry was glad the Emperor did not do
it. "Perhaps the Senator has not heard
of the success and prestige of America in
the yachting line." suggested Hanna.
amid laughter. The German Emperor
he paid, wanted the best yacht made and
therefore he came here.
Tillman wanted to know what kind of
yacht it was and Depew described it as
a sailing racing machine of the same type
as heat the two Shamrocks.
Hanna declared that not an American
shipyard had a contract for another mer
chant vessel after the nine or ten vessels
now under contract were finished.
Everybody knows, continued. Hanna,
that the United States is now. engaged in
a hand-to-hand contest with foreign na
tions to secure the commerce of the Ori
ent, and that the United States had been
foremost and steadfast in its policy to
secure the markets of China* and hold
them as an open door. The Philippine
archipelago was the key to the Orient
said he, and when it had become a naval'
station, surrounded by all the protection
that a maritime fleet would need, it would
become a factor in our commercial con
ditions in the Orient. Hanna then said
it was the purpose of the bill under the
postal system to establish a line on the
Atlantic coast of South America.
How England Gained Her Supremacy
England had gained her supremacy in
the markets oÂ£ the world by pursuing the
policr of establishing direct communica
tion.
"Personal contact," he said, "Is what
brings results and England, Germany
and France are now energetically at work
co put in the connecting link between the
Pacific and the Orient."
He spoke of the benefit that the passage
of the bill would bring as a result of in
creased trade with South American coun
tries, saying that trade now went by way
of Liverpool and Hamburg in foreign
ships and thence was transhipped to
South American ships. By carrying
American goods in American ships there
would be an increase of American trade.
In closing Hanna again adverted to the
question of the cost of labor, maintain
ing that wages in this country averaged
SO per cent higher than in European coun
tries.
The cost of ships built in the United
States was from 25 per cent to 30 per cent
higher than those built in Great Britain,
difference in price of labor making the
difference in cost. The difference in the
cost of operating American and foreign
ships was about 27 per cent, the higher
rates being paid ion American vessels.
He urged that the pending measure be
enacted into law as the one way to dem
onstrate to the satisfaction of all. that it
would be beneficent in its operations. -^ v
Early In the session Frye, in charge of
pending shipping bill, obtained an agree
ment that the Senate should vote on the
measure and all pending amendments at
3 p. m. Monday, March 17. the time being
entirely satisfactory to those opposed to
the bill.
Before consideration of the shipping bill
! An Important National Question.
j Senator Hanna said that if the United
i Stales tailed -to prom oy the experience
I of the older countries of Kurope, who
I have adopted a policy in ieierence to
! maritime matters, it would make a most
serious mistake. Every merchant ship
I constructed in foreign countries -was
; meant to be a ship of war in time of
i need. Hanna cited the feeling of uneasi
j ness along the Atlantic coast at the be
i ginning oi hostilities witn Spain and the
j relief which was experienced wridn the
] tour steamers of the American line were
! caled on by the Secretary of the Navy
i under the conditions of the law passed
i by Congress to perform picket service.
' He insisted that it was as important a
' national question as an economic policy
: to carry with the expenditure for build
ing up the navy, the expenditure for an
I auxiliary navy and merchant marine.
j There is something more in this trans
; portation question than merely carrying
mail matter; there Is more in it than dol
Â¦ lars and cents. He would like it. he said,
to be discussed above party considera
tions, because every one felt o like pride
in our>country's advance and development
and whatever is best tor the interests and
: safety and the perpetuity of our institu
! lions is best for all of us. ,-.
Tlllman interrupted to ask for Informa
! tion in regard to the reports that the
| Morgan syndicate had bought two or
i throe of oho European lines of steamers.
"You must ask somebody who knows,"
i replied Hanna. "1 do not Know anything
! about it."
"It was only reported you knew," sug
gested Tillman. "and I thought that the
Senator, being in touch with that class or
', people "
'Why docs the Senator say I am In
touch with them?" interjected Hanna.
Tillman: "The Senator is a man engaged
in shipping, is he not?"
"On the Great I-akes, yes," responded
Hanna, "but why does the Senator as
sume that I know what Morgan has
done?"

When a. resolution was introduced into; the Massa T

that body one of the members- exclaimed: "It is an
insult to those who. fought against monarchy that a
republic might live to bow at the foot of a.represen
tative of monarchy. I conceive a . monarchy .td. ; be a

are some Puritans still living: and kicking. ; : â¢ " ; '.
PRINCE HENRY of Prussia has now been
in this country long enough to. show what
manner of ma'h he is, and the American'peo
ple have met him often enough to show what manner
of people they are. The exhibition has been one of
which both sides may be well pleased. Democracy 1
and royalty have been- on their good behavior.
There has, been no. "condescension" on the part of
the Prince, .nor sycophaiicy' ort the. part of' the
crowds. The alarmists who were loud in 'their wails
over the coming of the Prince for fear it would cor
rupt our republicanism and incline us to monarchical
ideals have had their wailing for nothing. We have
received Henry like a free people, and/he has met our
welcome like a gentleman .who knows, he is having a
cordial hospitality shown .him and is. 1 determined to
deserve it. * . ',.,...' . ' : â¢ ' ,.'
The class of people who object to everything that
pleases, .the majority ; have been abundantly 'in evi
dence ever since, the arrival of the. Prince. , We have
no't had any exclusive possession of -ithem.' ; Dis
patches from Berlin reveal the fact that there are just
about as many "knockers" in Henry's Tiome as there
are in this big land of ours. The feature of the tour
that disturbed the German critics most was the press,
banquet in New. York,, at which Hen/y announced
that his brother the Kaiser had instructed him to,- be
attentive to the press because in America newspaper
man are "about equal to his generals; in. command."
The Berliners cpmpl.iin that neither the Prince .nor
the Kaiser nor any other, member of the family ever
made any. such complimentary remark about, journal
ists in Germany, nqr^ indeed, did any of them. ever at
tend a press banquet. They demand to know why
Henry cannot be as courteous to home papers, as to
foreign ones, and declare that his genial manners are
solely for foreign consumption and not for domestic
v.se. ' Â¦ - Â¦ ' . Â¦ ' '-'Â¦:'.Â¦'''
Of the tone of the American, ''kickers" enough is
already known to the public. If is 'needless, to recall
the wild yawp of Wheeler in the House' of Repre
sentatives," or, the wilder screams of the yellow press
against the princely visitor. Such critics doru't count.
The overwhelming of the people are show
ing that they understand the, laws of hospitality 1 and
recognize the fact/ that .'since a Prince is no r worse
than he would be without a title, he merits all the
honor that should be given to any man- who" comes

BRODRICK'S lecent statement in the House
of Commons concerning a permanent* in
crease of the British army shows that the war
in the Transvaal is like?y to have long lasting effects
rpon the empire and indirectly upon the world at
large, for the maintenance of a strong and active
army would give the British a military prestige in
Continental Europe and might lead to a readjustment
of international alliances.
A short time ago Colonel Picquart, whose honor
able conduct during the Dreyfus case commends Him
to public esteem, published a review of the. military
situation in Europe, and according to the reports
which have come to this country he suggested the
advisability of arranging an "understanding" between
France and Great Britain for the protection of their
mutual interests. The colonel pointed out that
France is already supporting as large an army as she
can sustain, and as her population is not increasing
there is no prospect that she will be able to augment
her army in this or in the next generation. Ori the
other hand, Germany and Italy are both increasing
in population and in wealth. Their comparative rank
with respect to France is therefore increasing every
year. It is evident, then, that the French must look
for allies strong enough to help them in case of need,
and, Colonel Picquart -argues, Russia alone is not
Â¦sufficient for that purpose, and Austria is too closely
bound to Germany to be counted on. It is to Great
Britain, then, that France must look.
A significant feature of Colonel Picquart's review
is the assertion that the South African war will give
the British imperial statesmen an 'opportunity to es
tablish a large army. Hitherto the taxpayers of the
kingdom have been too strongly opposed to voting
money for military purposes for the ablest and most
popular Ministry to accomplish much in that direc
tion. The war has revealed the military weakness of
the empire, ard now it is believed the people will
willingly sanction an increased army. Thus Great
Britain will be for the first time since the Napoleonic
wars able to give a valuable military aid to an ally,
and as a consequence her alliance will be the more
eagerly sought after.
Another Frenchman who has advocated an under
standing with Great Britain is Robert de Caix, who is
reported to be in some measure a spokesman for the
present Fiench Ministry. He views the subject from
a diplomatic standpoint and suggests an agreement
between the two nations with respect to the. Morocco
question. He proposes that France concede to Great
Britain a free hand along the Nile, while in return
France should obtain a free hand in all of Morocco
except that portion abutting on the Straits of Gib
raltar. The straits he would neutralize for the free
enjoyment of the commerce of all nations.
These proposals are of course no more than sug
gestions. They come from persons having no official
responsibility, and it is not certain how far they have
the approval and support of the leading minds of the
French people. The very fact that they are published*
ut all, however, shows a drift of French sentiment in
the direction of cultivating British friendship. Evi
dently the big army projects of the British War Office
are going to make more friends for the empire than
it has had in a long time. It is another proof that
the best way to get allies and to maintain peace is
to make yourself able to hit hard if war should come.

REPORTS from the East announce the appear
ance of a volume "printed; for ''private circula
tion^.containingv the -miscellaneous writings
of, the late. Justice Bradley of the United States.Su
preme Court. .Most 6f ; the writings' 'jare of little in
terest execptto the immediate circle oÂ£ the family and
the friends of the .writer, but among .them is a , paper
bearing upo'n the manner in.- which '/the Supreme
Court came to. reverse jts decision as; to the consti
tutionality of the act of Congress making greenbacks
a legal tender, .- That issue is 'one in' which the whole
country has; long'tieen interested, I and if is^not sur
prising, therefore, that the revelations f which Justice
â¢Bradley embodies' irrtKese writings -have';' not re
mained matters of strictly private circulation. .
1 has been charged again and again that after the
first 'decision of. the "court declaring the act unconsti
tutional the court; was '.'packed" for the purpdse of
obtaining a reversal of the decision. : The charge
grew out of the fact that Justice -Grier retired^ from
the bencli soon after the decision and was replaced
by Justice Strong; -'and; thÂ£t.rCongress;.' passed an act
increasing the number, of. Justices from eight to^nine,
so that another Justice.was, added, to the trench.
Grier' had joined with*, the majority.-of the court in
the first decision, the two new Justices held the oppo
site view, and accordingly when the issue came be
fore the. court again they were able to reverse it.
Bradley's paper brings out the fact that there was
no' truth in the charge that the court was packed. It
appears that the .bill to,' increase, the number ot Jus
tices was enacted beforerthe first legal tender case was
heard, and consequently thatdecision had nothing to
do with the 1 passage of the bill. Furthermore, he.re
peats.the-denial-so often .made that the appointment
of the two Justices was-.in- any <vay affected by >their
opinions in Tegard to the'act:.'" 'Â¦''-Â¦Â¦ v |
Now comes the most interesting, part of .the sWy.
It. is' charged ( that ,the\. anti-legal tender Justicesâ
Chase. Field,iNelson and Cliffordâ obtained the-, vote
of Justice Grier, who was old and infirm and about
to retire, and with his aid J'rushed" the decision'
through/and then tried to 'prevent it from ever being
reviewed. : After' telliirg how the vote was taken in
the conference of the court the story runs thus: .'.{
An attempt was then made to convince an aged' and
infirm member of the court (Judge Grier) that he hal
not understood the "question on which he voted..! He
said that he understood the- Court, of; Appeals ofyKen
tucky had declared . the legal tender law unconstitu
tional, and he voted to reverse that judgment. As this
was true, the ca3e 'of 'Â¦Hepbur^ against Griswpld was
declared to be affirmed] by rj, tsourt equally divided, and
we'pafssed to the next. case. This was the case of Me-
Glynn,' ex., against- < Ma^raw, '- and "another
aspect of the legal Render question v In this case the
venerable Judge referred-' to, for whose public services
and character, we^en'tertaai the 1 highest respect, made
some remarJis.'jHe was;"told that Ah cy were inconsistent,
with his vote in the former case/ He was reminded that
he had agreed with a certain member of the court, in
conversation on prepositions differing from all the, other
Judges; and nnallji-rhis' votÂ». was.' obtained for .affirming
Hepburn against Griswold; and-so the majority, whose
judgment is now fcaidj to was -obtained.
To all this we v> submitted. We could do nothing else.
In a week from that^day/ .every , .Judge on the bench,
authorized a committee of their number to say to the
Judge who reconsidered his vote that it was their unani
mous opinion that he ought to resign: ' These are the
facts. .We -make no comment. We do not say he did
not agree to. the 'opinion. , We only ask, of what value
was this concurrence, and of -what value is the judg
ment under such" circumstances? â¢ . ; .
' When Grier resigned and Strong and Bradley came
to the bench Chief Justice. Chase, according to! this
story, undertook to' have it decreed that .the-ques
tion of the constftutionality of. the act was closed by
the decision already -given, and when the majority of
the court ordered. that in certain cases then pending
| argument would be heard on "all issues, involved in
the record," including the legal tender question, the
Chief .Justice filed a written protest with, the court,
but withdrew it when ; he was.informed that if.it re
mained" the Justices on' the other side would file a
counter statement.. . The matter was then hushed up.
It has been given: to the public now only because all
Yhe parties to, it aire dead., It f is- a strange chapter in
judicial history, and shows liow the "sacred decisions
of .the Supreme^ Court",, are sometimes concocted.
LEGAL TENDER SCANDAL
Newhall's Views.
The San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce, to which was referred on Wednes
day the resolutions submitted to the con
ference of delegates from several sec
tions north of Tehachapi relative to the
stimulation of immigration, will call into
conference the State Board of Trade be
fore proceeding any further. Upon the
showing that the State Board has the fa
cilities for promoting immigration, a res
olution will probably be adopted suggest
ing that the several committees shall
co-operate with the board. This is the
substance of information received yester
day from George A. Newhall, president
of the Chamber of Commerce, who pre
sided at the meetings of the delegates in
the rooms of the Chamber of Commerce.
Mr. Newhall said:
-.-I hear that the State Board of Trade has
connections and an exhibition hall, and ex
hibits already prepared 'that are at the service
of the people of the interior/ free of any cost
to them. It is also represented that the State
Board of Trade is willing to have representa
tives of organizations representing the various
sections of California occupy desks in the
rooms of the board and also to have special
exhibits in the exhibition hall in the ferry
building. These inducements at the outset are
more than the -Chamber of Commerce has in
its' control. Indeed, it has not been the office
of the Chamber of Commerce to act a3 an
immigration bureau. That is out of our line.
We have gladly given the delegates irom the
interior the moral support of the chamber
and we shall as gladly continue in the same
direction. We will probably vote to ask the
representatives of the State Board of Trade
to come before us and make a statement, which
may prove to be the basis of future action.
This announcement will be of great in
terest to the people of all the country
north of Tehachapi. In view of the
probable action indicated by President
Newhall's remarks, directors of the
Eoard of Trade were interviewed. All
that President Xewhall had said was
confirmed. \:,'J .
Offer Free Facilities.
In substance the State Board of Trade
says in its offer that every section is
welcome to send its own representative
to occupy desk room, free of charge, at
the quarters of the board, and to, send
out therefrom its own literature. Each
section is free to establish its own ex
hibit in the exhibition hall, and", if it is
deemed advisable, the exhibits cam be
arranged by sections, so that one section
shall represent the Sacramento Valley,
another section the San Joaquin Valley,
anotHer the. Santa Clara Valley, and so
on through the entire Ust. The exhib
its that . are. already collected are illus
trative of the capacities for production
of nearly the entire area north of Te
hachapi, and there are many duplicates
that can be used to reinforce any sec
tional exhibit that may be instituted. The
State Board of Trade will undoubtedly
put up a large share of the money for
inserting in thousands of Eastern pub
lications an advertisement ottering to
give information to all inquirers for Cal
ifornia home3. That ought to bring
thousands of responses in a very snort
time. The representatives of the various
sections would have access to all the in
formation so obtained. Every county or
ganization, Board of Supervisors or body
organized for the promotion of the wei
lare of California is entitled to send a
representative to the State Board of
Trade upon the payment of $50.
An Ogden Exhibit.
The State Board of Trade will supply
a large part of an exhibit such as may
be desired ior Ogden if ways and means
can be provided to keep the exhibits from
freezing. In addition to the large exhi
bition hall that is now in use by the State
Board of Trade, the . great rfave of the
ferry building has been offered by the
State Board of Harbor . Commissioners
for the placing of a State exhibit, For
merly the Â¦ State Board of Trade occu
pied quarters in the Crocker â¢ building. A
far larger number of strangers visit the
ferry building than formerly went to the
board's exhibition when it was up town.
These are the representations that will
be submitted to the Chamber of Com
merce while it has before it the resolu
tions introduced at the recent conference.
The five Central American- republics have made, a
little agreement' among 'themselves that all disputes
over, boundaries shall be. referred .'to s<wne other
American- state for arbitration, and mow we may be
called upon at any time to settle a family dispute and
get all the pajties to it'down on us no matter how we
decide. .-.'-^ 'Â¦'."Â¦';"Â¦ ...-, \ . . -
BY reason of the action taken by the counties
of Central and Northern California in pro
posing a method of co-operation under the
leadership of San Francisco for advancing the wel
fare of 'this section r of the"< State, an opportunity is
afforded San Francisco to make her leadership" worth
something by exercising, the functions as well as hold
ing the prestige of a metropolis: '
In the movement proposed there is nothing of an
tagonism to the southern, or any other sectioji of the
State. Did the movement disclose any such tendency
San Francisco could not take part in it, for her
leadership is for the State at large and not for any
separate portion. Â¦ She can act vigorously in this in
stance because whatever is proposed by " the pro
moters of the movement will tend to benefit all Cali
fornia. Just as we have profited much by'.the devel-.
opment of the south, so will the south profit by the
development of the center and the north."
In presenting his plea for San Francisco leadership
President Green of the Sacramento Valley Develop
ment Association, after pointing, out what has been
done by the organization! in the interior, said: "We
cannot make plans for San Francisco. This associa
tion is going on. with .^its .work in any event. (The
amount of assistance that this metropolis can give us,
and the manner of the giving, must of necessity rest
with its business: men. The undeveloped resources of
the valley are vastâ almost incomprehensible* f Had
we means we would advertise these resources as-ex
tensively as our enterprising southern neighbors-ad
vertise theirs; had we the determination of what San
Francisco should do we would make it play the full
part Los Angeles plays to its surroundings." ..-,. -
â¢ All the speakers from the interior' emphasized the
point that their plea is not for a donation, or^ char
ity, but for co-operation. San Francisco is. , asked to
do nothing that will rotresiilt in tier "own, good. The
city holds the position of metropolis of the whole
State, ib ; is. true, but in a special sense she is the
metropolis of the north. Her men of light and leading
Â¦therefore must be ready to act for the northern coun
ties exactly as Los Angeles acts for the south. The
resources of the south have been largely .and exten
sively advertised. These of 'the north have not. It
is toward helping the north, therefore, that we must
direct our. energies now, for that is the section of the
State where our co-operation is most needed. , ...
Â¦ The application to San Francisco for leadership has
been made through the Chamber oÂ£ Commerce, and
it is for that body to decide whether it can undertake
it. If it cannot, and if the Board of Trade be too
much devoted to the State at large to deal with sec
tional organizations, then it will be the duty of a new
organization to act for the city.- There appears, how
ever, on the surface of things , no reason why the
Chamber of Commerce should not agree to the plan
submitted at the meeting on Wednesday. It affords
an excellent method of co-operation, and if it were
undertaken with zeal and business.sagacity.it would
undoubtedly lead to important results. . . . *' ' r
San Francisco has an abundance . of capital avail-,
able for movements of this kind. â¢ At the present time,
the? banks are paying but low, rates of interest, be
cause they cannot themselves place their money 'as
well as in former years. An- augmented activity in
the central and northern sections of the State would,
mean a demand for money as well as an increase of
business. Consequently the interests of the banks
and of all their depositors, as well as those -of mer
chants and manufacturers, are concerned in? the pres
ent movement. Good results will be as Â¦ beneficial .to'
the people of the city as to the people of the interior.
It is, in fact, a time for San Francisco to exert her
leadership in earnest and with her full force. There
will be big profits in the opportunity if we use it
well. /

at 1248 Washington street, reported to the
police yesterday that while he was stand
ing at the corner of Twenty-second and
Valencia streets shortly before 1 o'clock
yesterday morning, waiting for a car, he
v.HK approached by two men. One asked
htm for a match and he unbuttoned hid
rain coat to oblige him. Just then the
other man grabbed hold of his watch
chain, but finding no watch attached to
it sold, "What have you got about you
anyhow?" and began to feel his pockets.
McDougall, who was badly scared, put
his hand in his pocket and handed him
25. cents and some foreign silver coins,
which was all ho had. The men then ran
away. McDougall gave a good descrip
tion of them.

Superintendent of Schools Webster yes
terday submitted to his legal adviser the
question as to whether children born of
Chinese parents in this city may attend
any of the public schools they desire.
Section 1C62 provides that the Chinese
shall attend a school set aside for them.
A number of native-born Chinese claim
that they are exempt from the provisions
of the code because they are American
citizens. They are preparing to test the
matter in the courts through their attor
ney, -F. V. Bell. Webster's attorney will
endeavor to unearth a Supreme Court de
cision that the law is unconstitutional
which discriminates against certain races

San Francisco has already. widened two
off her thoroughfares and found it neces
sary to ' open others. Kearny street and
Grant avenue are examples of the
- It has been frequently stated that in
the thirty years preceding the erection of
the Claus Spreckels building at the corner
of Third and Market; streets but one or
two buildings of any pretentious .charac
ter have been erected on that thorough
fare. From Mission; street southward the
majority of the buildings are of one and
two stories, many of them In a dilapidat
ed condition. To the stranger who comes
in from the southern part of the State a
most gloomy view of the city is presented
until he emerges into the improved por
tion between Mission and Market streets.
Street Slow in Improvement
It would be necessary to Issue bonds for the
purpose, but the advantage gained would be
wor*h it. It would give us a broad esplanade
which could be "parked'.' down the center and
made to' resemble Canal street in New Orleant,
or which without â¢ parking would be like the
north end of Michigan avenue, Chicago â ample
for all the traffic that needed to use it, and
a pleasant and impressive approach to the
center of the city for people coming up the
coast. . -
â¢ There iÂ» nothing in the matter of a bond
issue that ought to frighten anybody. It is the
way fine cities are made. If such an improve
ment were â¢Â¦ so obviously needed In Tarts the
municipality would make It without a second
thought.
The street should be at least thirty feet
wider between the curbs. The widening of it
could be effected by condemning enough prop
erty from Mlrslon street southeastward for
six blocks down to Townsend.
Thirty Feet Is Needed
If San .Francisco continues its present
growth it will soon be facing the necessity
of widening Third street, between Mission and
Townsend. Already the traffic on that thor
oughfare Is badly congested, and is growing
worse dally. Â¦ , Â¦
OecauKe of the peculiar topography of the
city, certain of its streets inevitably tend to
become main highways. That IB the case with
Third street. The Southern Pacific freight
houses are at Fourth and Townsend, but in-
Kteurt of going up Fourth street the greater
part of the freight traffic naturally seeks the
ftif.ifftt grade, and iÂ» added to the passenger
traffic from the depot on Third. By tho tlmo
It reaches Mission it is pretty well drained
away by the Intersecting thoroughfares, but in
tho meantime there -In a badly, even dangerous
ly crowded ntretch, the difficulties of which
m'" complicated by a double line of street car
tracks and >>y the preiennÂ« at certain noun ut
numbers of hÂ«ckÂ» and private equipages.
The utreet whh wide enough In the seventies.
Nobody complained of It then. But these are
other times. Tho city hns already outgrown
many a provision made for It In "early days,"
and which the provider* thought would servo
forever. And the moral of thin I* that any
thing arranged for present need* only is going
to be outgrown ngaln. Whatever Improve
ment* are made now should beÂ»made for the
future as well a* the prcst-nt. There would
be little use of widening Third street unless
It were mada wide enough to>accommodate the
traffic that will be constantly Increased by the
growing wholesale district south of Market
street. â¢ Â¦Â¦'JHBS /.-,
Widening of Third Street.
So long as the Southern Pacific Com
pany maintains its passenger <Jepot and
freight sheds in their present location,
just so long will travel and. traffic on the
street be congested. Every one knows
the vexatious delays that mark every
trip on the cars to the depot. Thousands
of trucks bearing heavy loads use the
street as a main artery from early morn
ing till late at night. In addition to these
there are thousands of fighter vehicles
that form almost a continual procession.
The number of electric cars that cover
the district during the busy hours of -tho
day add to the confusion that results.
With wagons standing by the curb there
is not suhicient space for a truck or
wagon to swing out without using a large
section of the car track for the purpose.
A- few of these heavy trucks in line will
effectually delay traffic until they can
swing again into a clear roadway.
In speaking in advocacy of this matter
the latest issue of the Merchants' Re
view has this to say:
Another move In the march of progress
has been suggested by the Merchants" As
sociation. In a recent Issue of the Re
view, the monthly Journal issued by that
association, attention is called to the
urgent necessity for the widening of
Third street, from Mission street south
to Townsend. It is proposed to take a
strip fifteen feet in width from each side
of the street. .
Mrs. Kilbourn also charged Morrisey
with robbery, and his trial for that al
leged offense has been set for next Tues
day before Judge Troutt.
The trial attracted a great deal of at
tention, owing to the number of times
the matter came before the public. Mor
risey and Flynn were charged with as
saulting Mrs. Kilbourn, an elderly
woman of Santa Rosa, in a hut near
Bernal Heights on the night of Deoem
ber 15. They were arrested and given a
preliminary hearing before Police Judge
Mogan, who dismissed the charges on tho
ground that Mrs. Kilbourn was intoxi
cated. The woman then brought the
matter before the Grand Jury, which in
dicted the two young men on a serious
charge. The case was assigned to Judge
Troutt, and the trial lasted eight days.
The point. raised by the defense, the in
toxication of Mrs. Kilbourn, was the
main issue, and evidently bore great
weight with the jury, notwithstanding
the straight story told by her.
Frank Morrisey and Martin J. Flynn
were acquitted of the charge of crim
inally assaulting Mrs. Hose Kilbourn by
a jury hi Judge Troutfs court yesterday.
The jury was out from 11:40 to 3:30. The
verdict came as a complete surprise, as
it was expected that the best the two
young men would get would be a dis
agreement. As it was, one of the jury
men favored rendering a verdict of guilty
lrom the time the jury retired until with
in a few minutes of .the time it came In.
The foreman was Harry' G. de Greayer.
Woodworth came into prominence sev
eral months ago In connection with a
aensationul affair at Long Beach, in thirf
State. He purchased a piece of property
from a man named Kempfcr for U'J.Ow,
which sum Woodworth paid In currency.
Kempfer rilaced the money in the family
trunk anal gave Woodworth the deeds
for tho property. An hour later the
money and Woodworth had disappeared.
A few days afterward Mrs. Wundcr.
daughter of the Kcmpfers, confessed that
she nad taken the money out of the trunk
and given it to, Woodworth. The fugitive
was tried on oa charge of stealing the
deeds and was acquitted. When arrested
at Redwood City on September 6 by
Sheriff Mansfield the molds, blanks and
files were found In his trunk. Woodworth
claims to bo a dentist by profession.
EariKodgersof Los Angeles, counsel for
Woodwortn, pleaded in defense that when
Woodworth was living in the East he
made the molds, intending to manufact
ure with them a metallic design to place
on boxes of patent medicine as an ad
vertisement, but that before using the
molds Woodworth went to the secret ser
vice office in Boston and Inquired wheth
er it would be lawful for him to make
the advertising devices. When informed
that it would be unlawful to use the rep
resentation of any coin/- domestic or for
eign, he refrained from using the molds
or the steel blanks and the pattern
pieces that were found with the molds in
his possesion.
The prosecution, represented by Assist
ant United States . Attorney Duncan E.
McKinlay, met with an unlooked for re
buff at the outset of the trial when
Judge de Haven sustained Mr. ftodgers'
objection to the introduction of the steel
blanks, the Hies and the pattern pieces
in evidence, on the ground that they had
not been mentioned in the indictment.
Sheriff J. H. Mansfield of San Mateo
County, and Secret Service Agent John
Cronin, testified that the prisoner had ad
mitted to them that he had' made , the
molds, but with the intention of using
them for an advertising device. No evi
dence wan introduced by the defendant.
The indictment contained four counts,
the first two charging him with being in
possession of and making , three plaster
of paris molds, with intent to use the
same' in the manufacture of counterfeit
dollars. The third count charged him
with having made the Impression of a
dollar in the mold with the intent to
counterfeit.
O. H. Woodworth, D. D. S., was con
victed by a jury in the United States
District Court yesterday on the fourth
count of the Indictment charging him
with being in possession of the impression
of a dollar, with intent to use the same
as an advertising device. The prisoner
will appear for sentence this morning.
The highest punishment that can be im
posed under the statute is a fine of $100.

The six Chinese appeared in Judge
Cabaniss' court yesterday morning and
the cases were continued till to-day.
As they were driving away with the
wagon Cavanagh called upon them to
stop, and he and Policeman < Merchant
made an investigation. They opened the
bundle and found the dead body of a Chi
nese. The owner of the laundry, Yee
Yung, and five other Chinese, were placed
under arrest for removing a dead body
without having a permit from the Coron
er, and Detectives Dinan and Q'Dea were
detailed on the ease. The body was taken
to the Morgue, 'where it was found that
the Chinese had died from natural causes.
A Chinese was observed by Policeman
W. J. Cavanagh acting in a suspicious
manner in' front of a laundry at 1335
Pacific street about 4 o'clock yesterday
morning. The officer watched him till
he saw him enter the laundry. Just then
a wagon drove up to the door of the
laundry, and in a few minutes five Chi
nese came out, carrying a large bundle,
which they deposited in the wagon.

MYSTERY OF CHINESE
LAUNDRY EXPLODED

The Btandard, Morning Post, Dallv
New*, Daily Chronicle and Dally Tele-
Er&ph are equally enthURinHtic over the
project. Whllft no nctlon hnn yot b^en
tuken.' thorns who havo received thÂ« let
tÂ«rn are endeavoring to intercut the State
Iioard of Trade, the Chnmber of Com
merce, the Merchants' Anffoclatlon and
other bodies in making n comprehensive
exhibit of the Stnto'u products.
The chief object of the exhibition will be to
illustrate the striking development of American
trade and industry during recent years. Special
attention will be called to labor saving ma
chinery, wnich has been worked up to &uch a
remarkable point in the United States. British
manufacturers and their workmen will be given
an opportunity to see exactly how American
goods are produced. Efforts will be made to
bring home to the men in particular the fact
that perfection of machinery does not by any
means tend to reduce the value of skilled labor.
The exhibits will not be entirely commercial.
There will bo section* devoted to art, education
and science, and the hope of the Crystal Palace
director* is not only to appeal to the Hrlilsh
trader, but to arouse public Interest In every
thing American, including the method* by
which American commerce has been Â«o vastly
increased in the- course of the last generation.
All the London papers speak highly of
the project. The London Times in its
issue of January 18 says:
Although success Is already assured by the
number of prominent American firms 10 whom
Epace has already been alloted, we, as Ameri
can residents in London, desire to see the ex
hibition as complete and representative as pos
sible and to this end we earnestly solicit your
good offices.
All communications by proposing exhibitors
should be addressed to ALFRED H. POST.

Crystal Palace Exhibition), Produce Ex
change. New York City.
I am sir. faithfully yours,
F. C. VAN DUZER, Hon. Secretary.
In view of the above, we request you to kind
ly lay before the honored Governor of your
State and the proper State authorities our
petition that they give us such aid as may be
within their power to make the proposed ex
hibition such a success as may be a, credit to
America and her industrial forces, and that
you make known to all the leading companies
and firms of your State that such an exhibition
will be opened on the 15th to the 20th of May
of the present year, and solicit their support
for the same.
That the present agitation here regarding
conservative machinery and old methods of pro
duction and trade offers an opportunity which
our industries should not neglect.
Solicit Support for a Display.
That, heretofore, the European public have
only partially been brought face to face â gen
erally through travelers and the press â with
our industrial achievements, and do hot com
prehend to what extent our country is prepare.1
to supply foreign wants.
That a proper exhibit of our manufactures
of iron will create an extensive European de
mand; and that our advance in all kinds of
labor-saving machinery, including electilc ap
pliances for motive power, will, whf-n seen here
in action, find a widespread market.
That the output of our looms, confront! nar
that of the Old World, will find favor amonj
consumers and greatly increase our national
exports.
That tangible evidences of American mineral
wealth will enable Europe to partially under
stand what reserves we hold in hand.
That the exhibition of our agricultural' prod
ucts will create an increasing demand for thim.
That the fostering of all the elements which
may increase our foreign trade will rapidly call
into existence an American mercantile marine,
from which the nation may derive - honor and
profit in the transportation of its own goods,
Instead of relying upon other countries for
such conveyance.
That in doing this our country *>111 not only
derive abundant reward for well applied en
ergies, but widely benefit those who recog
nize their results.
We believe that the productive forces of our
country have reached such magnitude as to
make it desirable that every means possible bo
sought to open markets abroad for our surplus
products.
Sir: On this coronation year of his Majesty
King Edward VII, when London will be crowd

The "American Society in London,"
composed of men who are either officially
or financially Interested in the increase
of trade relations between England and
America, is at the head of the enterprise.
Ihe general committee in cnarge is com
posed of the following:
' L. A. Lathrop, United States Consul at
Bristol, "England, has written to a num
ber of his former friends in this State
asking that attention v b6 called to the
advantages that are likely to accrue to
the Pacific Slope by a display of its prod
ucts at an exhibition to be held in the
Crystal Palace, London, from May 15 to
September 20, this year. It is expected
that thousands of tourists will visit the
British Isles to witness the coronation,
and that an object lesson in American
manufactures would be appreciated by
people from all over the world.
Edward Vaughn, who was convicted by
a jury in Judge Dunne's court on the
charge of grand larceny for stealing $1 25
from Samuel McDonald at Sixth and
Howard streets January 5, was sentenced
to three years in San Quentin. George
\V. Larkin, motorman on an Eighth
street car, convicted of simple assault for
striking W. R. Jones, a paosenger, with
a controller bar, was fined $G0, which was
at once paid into court.
George Sametz was tried by a Jury In
Judge Dunne's court yesterday on the
charge of burglary for breaking into a
loom at 651 Broadway on January 11 and
stealing a purse containing $21 65. The
Jury convicted him of burglary In the
second degree and he will be sentenced
to-day.
The case of John Sheehan. charged with
robbery, was dismissed by Judge Cook on
motion of the District Attorney on the
ground that the evidence was insufficient
to secure a conviction. Sheehan was ac
cused by M. G. Sears, a saloon-keeper at
Washington and East streets, of having
entered the saloon early in the. morning
of November 24, knocking him down by
a blow on the head, which rendered him
unconscious, and when he recovered he
found* that the lights had been turned out
and $220 stolen from the cash drawer.
The defendant shot and killed Gin Do
Hing, a boy 14 years of age, In the base
xaent of 828 Washington 6treet on the
morning of July 29 because, . he alleged,
the boy's father and uncle had robbed
him of his property in China. After the
murder he fled to Napa, where he was
arrested by Detective Ed Gibson.
"If I should find," said the Judge, "that
the evidence shows a case of murder In
the first degree I have to assume the re
sponsibility of sentencing the prisoner to
be hanged, which is a position I do not
relish. There have been a few Instances
of the kind, but to the best of my recol
lection the evidence only showed murder
In the second degree."
Chew Lan Ongr withdrew his plea of not
guJJty In Judge Cook's court yesterday
and pleaded guilty to the charge of mur
der. The Judge accepted the plea with
some diffidence and said he would-care
fully read over the evidence taken at the
preliminary examination and would on
Monday sentence the defendant. -

President's Viewo Not Changed.
Many mlMeadlnK statements aa to the atti
tude of the President, the Cabinet and the
Housn Republicans are appearing in the news
papers. 1 cannot speak of the conferences with
the President. lint I have every assurance
that the Cabinet Is not divided on this ques
tion, nor tmve a majority of House Hepulill
cans committed iIhiiimIh-h either to thn Mor
ris or the Tawney policy. The propodltlon of 20
per cent reduction, If made, will put off, In my
JudgmcV, the unnexutlon of Cuba for many
years. Kho will not POTOI In until her popula
tion Is Americanized from the Htates, It will
settle the quetitlon for generations to rnmo and
givo rest and truiuiulUty to thn sugar bust
utiem. If the i.-.lui-tiiiii Is until.-, no further
.-Ii.ii Â»-.i will I mi inadn. To refusu to do any.
thins Â«. .ni, i put tin- iimini- In a position hnntllo
In Â»hÂ« rrrsldent, would CHUufi uncertainly and
a feeling "i i.i'i.i.-iifiifi.iii tn Hi" producers of
mieni' in (lie Mm. Â» nii'i would do utterly iU-
mor&llclnf.
I think the large majority of the Republi
cans have made up their minds that we muut
do something for Cuba. There are thri>e propo
sitions presented which have this professed end
in view. The proposition of Morris of Minne
sota provides for an Increase in the tariff on
puK'ir to the outside world and a rebate, on
sugar imported from Cuba. It does not seem
to me that many llepubllcans are willing to
Increase the duty on sugar.
Then there is the proposition of Tawney to
vote between Â«7.000,0<X) and |H,00O,0UO directly
into the Cuban treasury and to ask the Cuban
Government to distribute about fl, 000,000 ac
cording to his figures, to native Cuban planters.
Tha first payment in to be made without any
compensation from Cuba in any way or man
nerâa pure gift to the Cuban Government. It
hardly needs tho opinion of a lawyer to say
that such a procedure would be unconstitu
tional. His proposition further is to pay a like
sum yearly on tho granting of reciprocal con
cessions and the passage of our immigration
and exclusion laws. Of course no bounty of
this kind could be distributed without a Hcan
da.1 ami a fraud. In the next place, sevon
eighths of the Cuban laborers would still re
main without work. It would be just aa ensy
for the sugar trust to obtain a concession on
the sugar they bought on account of the boun
ty aa to obtain a concession where the planter
knew he was to have a 20 per cent concession
in duty. Thus Tawney's resolution has no ad
vantages over thnt of a 20 per cent reduction
and It ha* tho disadvantages named.
Tho third proposition U that for a 20 per
cent reduction of duties. This would Injure no
home Industry. The witnesses before the
committee united in testify*ng â and the sta
tistics prove â that tho trust has received no
benrtlt In buying sugar, either In Hawaii or
Porto Rico, since the duty was reduced or re
moved. The entire benefits have been reaped
by the planters in these Inlands. We have every
reason to believe the same would prove true
as to Cuba.

Commissioner Chambers filed a dls-
Bcntlnjr opinion. Tho Commissioner laid
down the following proposition:
A seaman injured by the explosion which
destroyed the battleship Maine in the harbor
or Havana, Cuba, on February IS, 1838, had
no Individual claim ae^lnut Brain, even if that
government was responsible to the Unltea
Ktates for the explosion, and, therefore, such
h seaman is not entitled to an award in lilt,
favor from the Fpanlsh Treaty Claims Com
mission organized by the act of Congress of
March 2, 11*01. to adjudicate all individual
claims of citizens of the United Htates against
Hpaln which the United (States released to
J-j n!:i and agreed to pay by the treaty of peace
of December 10, itSOH.
The claims bo far filed -with the com
mission which will be affected by this
decision amount to about $2,600,000, which
probably would be Increased to jn.OOO.OOJ
had the decision been favorable to tho
claimants.
Individual claims of cltltenÂ» of one nation
may arise aroinst the Kovernment of another
nation for redress of injuries to ptrsons or
property which such dtlrens may have Â«uÂ»
tclnÂ«d from eurh government or any of Us
..i->?m. Hut such individual claims do not
arlKu in favor of the ofneem and seamen of a
ship of war who receive, in the JlnÂ« of duty,
Injuries to their persons forÂ»whlch a foreign
Kovernment Is responsible. The claim against
the foreign government Is wholly national and
all Injuries to ruch officers and seamen are
merged In the national Injury, and they can
look only to their own government for 'such
remuneration as It may choose to give them.
Tho commission holds that:

MONONGAHELA, Pa., March 6.-An
explosion in the Catsburg mine of tho

death of flve men and serious injury of
several others, two fatally. Tho dead:

Fatally Injured^ James Haggcr and
James Torrent, both badly burned.
On Monday a premature explosion or
dynamite caused gas to ignite and since
that time tho mine has been burning.
All the air channels were closed and it
waa hoped that , tho Humes could be
smothered. This morning twenty men onÂ»
tercd tho mine to investigate and it lÂ»
thought that the turning on of tho air,
which had been shut off, by the fan
caused tho gas which had accumulated
to ignite. A terrible explosion followed
soon after tho men entered. A relict
party, headed by Superintendent Seddon
and Mine Inspector Loutitt, mude an ef
fort and nearly succeeded In reaching tno
Imprisoned men, but woro compelled to
return to air. All were ovcrcomn and aro
to-night in a serious condition. A Bccond
relief party, headed by John Coulter, en.
tored the mine by another way, but a
second explosion occurred and tho men
were forced to retreat. A third relief
party mado a futile attempt. A fourth
attempt will bo made to reach the bodlo*
of tho mÂ«n who nro bollovod to hitve

Bohn'B cruelty and other conduct are

Chicago and taking refuge In the Oriental
home of the theosophists In California

Cruelty, neglect and even more* serious
charges are made by Mrs. Dohn in her

band injured her health by his treatment
until she was almost broken down. She
further alleges that her husband and the
co-respondent were more than friendly- In
their relations.
In addition It Is alleged that Bohn took
his- wife to dlsrepu.tabie Chicago theaters
and stood by while her mother, Mary E.
Green, struck her, without making: any

derstands that the alliance is aimed at

to resist any infringement of her rights.
Supported- by Great Britain, Japan may
adopt a policy more decided In tone than
that hitherto followed. If war results
and Ruwia be victorious, undoubtedly the
Czar will extend his sovereignty over as
much of Chinaiand Korea as he desires.
In this caso ho will apply the Russian
tariff to .acquired territories, and assur
ances given to the- United States that

necessarily cease to be binding. There

vantageous to the United States.

Water Front Notes.
A breaking bar limited the going and coming
of vessels yesterday to a very few. The yacht
Ramona, bound eouth. tried to cross, but was
compflk'tl to turn back, as were the steam col
lier Amunclon and the whaler William Daylle*.
The Bar Breaking.
The steam whaler William Baylies tried to
start on her annual cruise yesterday, but found
that the Etormy Pacific, by "raising a crop of
breakers on the bar, had locked the Golden
Gate. Twice she essayed the crossing, but
each time was obliged to turn back. She may
get away to-day, but will more likely wait until
Saturday, as Friday is not a popular sailing
day in whaling circles. The Baylies is the first
of the fleet ready for the bone and blubber
hunt. All the whalers will be ready for sea in
a few days.
First of the Whalers.
â¢â¢Walt nothing. I'll fix the Frenchman so
he'll have to move and we'll argue afterward."
Seizing a carpenter's ax, Splcer cut the lines
that held the Dijon and the tide did the rest.
The captains have not since met.
"Don't monkey with that fellow. Cap. He
sprung his flag oh me yesterday and he won't
listen to argument. Just wait awhile and I
guess he'll co."
Splcer couldn't wait, however. He had a
gang of men waiting to scrape the Florence
where the Ville <Je IMJon rubbed her.
McGovern was alarmed at the demonstration
and when Captain Splcer t>f the Florence in
fifted yesterday on the Frenchman's removal
and tpoke of UElng force McGovern warned
him.
McGovern's gesticulations alarmed the skip
per, who rushed to his ship, called aft the crew,
hoisted the French flag and defied the State
officer.
"If you don't move your old ship I'll move
her for you." said McGovern emphasizing each
word with a shake of his fist.
Captain Pplcer of the American ship Flor
ence yesterday eettled an international argu
ment by cutting the mooring; lines of the
French bark Vllle de DIJon. Both vessels were
moored at Main street, the Florence alongside
the wharf and the DIJon alongside the Flor
ence. Captain Bony of the DIJon three days
ago was glv<>n twenty-four hours' notice to
move his ehlp. He didn't do it. Every time
Wharfinger McOovern broached the subject
Captain Bony protested. llcOovern insisted â
in English. Uony noted his exceptions â in
French. Neither had more than the slightest
bowing acquaintance with the language of the
ether and both got mad.
Cut the Frenchman's Lines.

The Mayor assigns as his reasons for
his veto that tho fund was set aside for
a specific purpose and tho question of its
status ia now being coneidered by the Su
preme Court. . .
Mayor Schmitz yesterday returned with
out his approval the resolution of tho
Beard of Supervisors recommending that
the city treasury return to the general
fund tho sum of $125,000, set aside by a
former board to bo used for the purchase
of lanÂ£ for the St. Mary's Park. The in
tent of the resolution would have made
possible the payment of some $90,000 in
demands for milarles and other items re
maining unpaid for the year 1900, but Jf
the Mayor's veto is sustained tho fund
will be kept Intact. \

FAMILY SUFFERS FROM
SICKNESS AND HUNGER
Illness Brings Destitution to George
W. Wildgans, His Wife and
Five Children.
George W. Wildgans and his ' family,
which consists of a wife and five children,
residing at 476 Eighth street, are In a
state of pitiable destitution. Wildgans,
the husband and father, and the oldest
of his five children, a little girl ten years
of age, have been stricken down with
typhoid fever and the mother is in very
delicate health. The family i is suffering
for want of the bare necessities of life
and unless immediate aid is given .them
the father and the little girl, who are suf
fering from the dread fever, will likely
succumb. . ' 'â¢ â¢.- ;>; -v / '
For the past nine weeks, during the
father's illness, 'the kind neighbors have
supported the little family. They have
taken up subscriptions and have given a
raffle to raise money to purchase pro
visions and medicine. The neighbors also
reported the case to a number of char
itable societies, but the societies failed
to give any substantial aid.
The family is deserving Â«of assistance.
Those who have investigated their con
dltion report that their misfortune has
been caused by sickness and is no fault
of theirs. Until the father -was stricken
with typhoid fever he was employed by
the San Mateo Electric Railroad. He was
a hard working, sober man and always
managed to provide for hla family.

Alleges That There Is No Complaint,
Indictment or Commitment to
Hold Him.
Charles R. Mains, founder of a myth
ical four billion dollar. syndicate, appeared
before the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals yesterday morning and applied
for a writ of habeas corpus. He read an
affidivlt in which he alleged that he was
illegally restrained of his liberty by the
keeper of the Broadway Jail at the re
quest of United States Marshal John II.
Â£hine and upon no other authority. He
alleged further that there was no legal
complaint, indictment, information or
commitment to warrant his Imprisonment.
Judge Gilbert announced that the de
cision of the court would be rendered this
morning. A few .days ago the indictment
charging Mains with using the mails with
intent to defraud was quashed on his mo
tion by United States District Judge de
Haven - on the ground that it had been
Improperly drawn up. The original com
plaint had been previously dismissed by
United States Court Commissioner Hea
cock, but when Judge de Haven quashed
the indictment hi made an order commit

HEAVY-WEIGHT BOXERS
' READY FOR THE FRAY
KPDnedy Will Meet Johnson in a Fif
teen-Round Bout in Reliance
Athletic Club Ring.
OAKLAND, March 6.â Jack Johnson,
the chocolatei-hued fighter from Colorado,
who will meet big Joe Kennedy in a fif
teen-round bout to-morrow night at the
Reliance Club, has been doing some up-to
date training during his preliminary work.
In this city. Johnson is faithful In the
gymnasium, but he varies the monotony
of the punching bag and the sparring
warm-ups by hurdling up and down
Broadway afoot and awheel at a' pace
that brings out the natives.
In fact Johnson is not losing any op
portunity to keep himself In the publio
eye. On a clear morning the spectacle
of a husky colored man plowing briskly
through the main thoroughfare with a
dumbbell in each hand anxiously arouses
the plodding pedestrian of ordinary gait.
The Denver heavy-weight varies this ex
hibition by taking a whirl on a â¢wheel,
and it is a sight to observe this lanky
Rocky Mountain pugilist as he pedals
along the busy thoroughfare.
But he has worked hard and his fol
lowers say his eccentricities are to ba
tolerated. They expect that he will make
a rattling showing against Kennedy. Tha
San Franciscan will come across <he ba>
with a confident backing. Report is that
he is in prime condition. His splendid
showing with Champion Jeffries some
months since gained him a big following.
The opening number for the tournament
will be a four-round discussion between
Bobby Johnson and Jocky McDermott. a
-brace of bantams who have a bit of speej
and can do a very good short time argu
ment in the ring.
Superintendent Fawcett has substituted
Jack Carroll, a hard-hitter from the San
Francisco Atftletic Club, for Jack Dough
erty in the ho with Louis Long of tha
Reliance ClulJ. Dougherty dscided he dirt
not want another meeting with Lonjr. who
defeated him a short time aso. Carroll
was in training for a cross-bay event and,
will be ready.

rangements to handle a big crowd Friday

Supervisors' Committee Recommends
REGULATES TEMPORARY
STREET OBSTRUCTION
the Passage of an Ordinance for
Building Operations.
The Supervisors' Street Committee yes
terday recommended the passage of an
ordinance regulating the temporary oc
cupar.y of a public street during building
operations. The ordinance requires the
obtaining of a permit to obstruct the
street by owners from the Board of
Works, which may at any time revoke it.
J. J. O'Brien and F. 'H. Qaulmah informed
the committee that the ._ builders are
unanimously in favor of the ordinance.
The committee ordered a resolution to
be prepared directing the Board of Works
to remove all obstructions on Channel
street and the immediate vicinity located
on city property and obstructing public
streets within ninety days. This action
was taken on the City Attorney's opinion
that Channel street is a public highway.
Joseph Scheerer stated that he had been
in possession of the property included in
the terms of the resolution for twenty
years and claims adverse title to land on
Ninth and Channel streets.
The property-owners of Eureka Valley
petitioned for the abatement of nuisance
caused by Gray Bros.' brickyard at State
and Douglas streets and the firm was
given ninety days to comply.
G. W. Simpson, the occupant and, owner
of a building which was moved to the
roadway of Shrader street, between
Haight and Waller, by. the Sheriff on a
writ of restitution, informed the commit
tee that he would remove the house if
given a reasonable length of time. The
request of the Board of Works for au
thority to remove the building in pieces
to the corporation yard was laid over for
thirty day3.
The committee notified M. Harris of the
California Street Railway Company and
H. Lynch of the Market-street road to ap
pear at the next meeting and explain
why the space between the tracks on Cali
fornia street, between Kearny and Mont
gomery, had not been repaved.

WATSON AWAKENS WITH
FIGHTING BLOOD UP
Pcigns Unconsciousness at Hospital
Until Policemen Withdraw, and
Then Starts Trouble.
A colored soldier named Watson, big,
brawny and belligerent, turned the Emer
gency Hospital into a "rough house',' last
night, and It required the united energies
of seven policemen to subdue him.
Watson wandered into the grocery of
Fred Nordholz at Ninth and Folsom
streets about 10 o'clock and asked for a
Chinatown guide. The proprietor replied
that he didn't keep any in stock, and the
soldier resented the flippancy of the re
ply by starting to hurl the contents of
the shop at him piece by piece.
Nordholz retreated under the bombard
ment to a counter, where he secured a
large, healthy club and. then he began to
set the military man a strenuous pace.
Tho police ambulance took Watson to. the
Emergency Hospital in a seemingly un
conscious condition and he was put 'to
bed. As soon as the policemen had with
drawn the soldier jumped up and started
to clean out the ward.
Fortunately policemen were close at
hand and the fighting patient was sub
dued after a fierce struggle. He received a
badly cut head and face during the two
encounters. As soon as his wounds were
dressed he was removed to the City
Prison and booked on the charge of bat
tery.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, March 6.-Joseph
Lebillous, a wealthy lumberman of Reid
Island, was drowned yesterday after be
ing nearly pulled ashore by two com
panions.
With David Whitner and Wilbur Con
ant ho left the mainland for his head
quarters on the island. After they had
left the island the boat was caught in the
tide-rip and capsized in a trice. The three
men were instantly in the water and Le
billous sank. On coming to the surface
he was caught by Whitner, but sank
again.
Rising the second time Conant caught
the drowning man and assisted him on
to the bottom of tho boat. Lebilllous was
the first to give signs of exhaustion, and
to assist him the other two held on to
him, maintaining this trying position for
over an hour, but every breaker made
thje men weaker, and as they were soakel
with the cold water and their strength
was taxed to keep themselves from drop
l'ing off the slippery bottom it was a hard
battle.
Lebillous finally dropped, his head in
utter exhaustion and shortly afterward
died. For fifteen minutes longer the two
brave men clung to their companion in
the hope that they would be able to
reach shore and thus prevent the loss of
the body. This also was impossible.

SAN JOSE. March 6,-There seems to be
a hoodoo hovering over the cornerstone
of the new Carnegie library. This time
some one has broken into Contractor Cur
tis' toolhouse, where the stone has lain
since he removed It from the foundation,
and cut off part of the Elks' Inscription,
which was so objectionable to the Pas
tors' Union. Â¦-â¢Â¦>:
The day after the Elks laid the corner
stone Contractor Curtis removed it from
the foundation because it was a granite
block and not sandstone. Then the Pas
tors' Union took up the matter. It ob
jected to the stone being replaced, as the
ceremonies had been "held on Sunday ana
besides it bore an inscription that it was
laid by the Elks. The ministers declared
it was an insult to the citizens. The Coun
cil ordered the stone relaid.
Now some one has cut off part of the
inscription. To-day Contractor Curtis
took the stone to a stoneyard to be trim
med because of the defacement. On top
of this comes the news that some min
ister of the city wrote to Carnegie about
the' Elks placing their inscription on the
building and this letter was sent to O. A.
Hale by Carnegie's secretary. It is
hardly probable Contractor Curtis will
have the inscription cut on the stone, but
will replace a smooth stone and after the
building is completed the inscription can
be cut.
There is considerable feeling over the
matter and it is believed, now that some
one has mutilated the cornerstone, that
if it were placed in position with the in
scription the first dark night it would be
cut off.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
SAN DIEGO. March 6.â A plan to make
a bold strike for liberty has been discov
ered by the Sheriff's office, and but for
the disclosure might have resulted in the
death of Jailer Maddox and the libera
tion of H. R. and Bessie Hall, the dia
mond thieves, J. Marshal Brooke, accused
of cattle stealing, and any others whom
these three might be disposed to let out.
Hall ind Bessie Hall are under sentence
of ten years each for robbing a Santa Fe
baggage room. They were the instiga
tors of the plot and had taken Brooke in
to do a portion of the heavy fighting.
Bessie and H. R. Hall were confined in
different parts of the jail, but were able
to keep up communication through notes
carried back and forth by a negro trus
ty, who did the sweeping out.
A search of the jail resulted in the dis
covery of some of the notes which had
been sent by Bessie Hall to her paramour,
outlining the plans which they expected to
follow. Jailer Maddox was to De sand
bagged when he entered the cell room
with the prisoner. The keys were to be
secured from him and the three were to
make their. escape, and as many more as
could be released In the time the conspir
ators had.
The two sandbags were found, filled with
salt instead of sand, and made from the
lining of Hall's coat. One bag was wrap
ped with wire from a broom and the other
with tape which had been secured in some
manner unknown to the jailer. The cells
of the prisoners have been changed and
they will be closely watched hereafter.
Brooke's .trial is now in progress. Hall's
case is on appeal to the Supreme Court.
The machine politicians have reached
the conclusion that the primary election
law will stand. When the Republican
local convention of San Francisco ap
pointed a new county committee the
leaders of the machine forces calculated
that the law would be set aside as un
constitutional by the Supreme Court.
Special care was taken to keep out of the
committee outspoken anti-boss Republi
cans. Later on the leaders of the push
ascertained that the people were preparr
ing to fight for the maintenance of the
primary law, hence the projected assault
was abandoned. The supporters of Gage
are now preparing for a struggle at the
primaries, but they are calculating that
-the contest will be restricted to the twelve
cities mentioned in the act, wherein the
provisions of the law are mandatory.
The Twelve Cities
The twelve cities, having each a popu
lation of more than 7500, are San Fran
cisco, Las Angeles, Oakland. Sacramento,
San Jose, San Diego, Stockton, Alameda,
Berkeley, Fresno, Pasadena and Vallejo.
The manipulators of the Gage campaign
fancy that the voters dwelling in places
other than the twelve mentioned cities
will neglect their opportunities and fail
to take the preliminary steps which the
law says must be taken. In the event of
such neglect the machine will settle the
question by appointing Gage delegates to
the State convention. In cities and towns
where it* is optional to use. the primary
law the preference must be made known
at a special election. In the first place
a petition must be presented to the Board
of Supervisors or other governing body.
If the petition receives the proper num
ber of signatures and observes other re
quirements of the act the Board of Sup
t-rvisors must, within thirty days, call a
special election and submit the issue to
the voters. The ballots used shall con
tain the words: "For the Primary Law,"
and "Against the Primary Law." In case
a majority of votes cast at such election
on such question shall be for the primary
law the provisions of the chapter shaii
take effect and remain in force until ren
dered inapplicable thereto by a simlar
vote.
Time for Action.
It will take considerable time to pre
pare and circulate petitions. Cities and
towns of lesser population than 7500
should settle at once the issue whether
the provisions of the primary law should
be made available in their respective lef
calities. *
The primary election for delegates to
the nominating conventions must be held
on August 12, hence it is time for action
on the part of Republican voters who do
not reside in any of the twelve cites men
tioned in the act. When the time limit
expires the machine manipulators will
justify the appointment of Gage delegates
by saying: "We did not oppose a primary
election, but the people neglected or re
fused to petition the Board of Supervisors
to call a special election to determine
whether there should be a primary elec
tion, therefore the delegates were chosen
by the county committee according to
party custom."
Questions involved here may be accepted
as vital topics for discussion at the League
Convention of Republicans, to be held
next month in San Jose. There is a wide
spread and growing public sentiment in
California that the next Republican State
Convention shall fairly represent the
wishes of the rank and file of the party
and not be merely representative of the
â¢iesires of office-holding and office-seeking
members of the party. Perhaps the Re
publican State Centra] Committee may
see fit to urge cities other than the twelve
mentioned in the act to take immediate
steps for accepting the option presented
!ry the primary election law. to the end
that every delegate applying for admis
sion to the convention shall present a
commission certifying that he was duly
chosen at a popular election, conducted
under the forms of law.
The Bosses Have Trouble.
There is whispering in the camp of the
Losses that Herrin and Burns are not as
<lcÂ«e together as they once were and that
Â«iage would be happier if the "colonel"
'.vould be a little more explicit regarding
1; s intentions in the gubernatorial cam
jÂ»asn. The colonel's own steadfast hench-
li.cn are longing for a chance to even up
v. :i Herrin for the latter's deal with
â¢ r.snmlns, wherein the workers belonging
to IS urns' old guard were thrown down.
When the true story is told it will be
made plain, perhaps, that Herrin and
Crimmins jobbed Burns in the distribu
tion of local patronage, but that will not
prevent art ultimate alliance of all the
boss elements to job the people. It is
obvious that Gage, however happy he
would be with the lasting support of both
Herrin and Burns, would rather lose the
colonel than part with Herrin. The Burns
workers are demanding that Gage shall
recognize the colonel's men in the next
award of official patronage. The fondness
of the Governor for Herrin is accounted
for on the theory that the latter is able
to swing Democratic votes. Gage is go
ing ahead with his fight on the assump
tion that he can force his own nomination
on the Republican party and by the ac
tive assistance of Herrin dictate'the nom
ination of a weak man to head the Dem
ocratic ticket.
Battle Signs in the Sixth.
There are signs of a big battle in the
Sixth District, where the Democrats en
tertain hopes of breaking California's Re
publican column in Congress. The district
embraces the counties of Santa Cruz
Monterey, San Benito, Fresno. Kings
Madera, Merced, Stanislaus and San
Joaquin. It is practically settled that
James C. ?*eedham. now serving as the
Representative of the Seventh District,
will be the Republican nominee in the
faixth. Under the reapportionment made
at the last session of the Legislature his
home county, Stanislaus, was taken from
the Seventh and placed in the Sixth Dis
trict. Mr. Needham is an able and popu
lar man. The Democrats, recognizing his
strength, are advocating the nomination
against him of W. M. Conley. who made
a great record as a vote-getter in the
campaign of 1898, when he ran for As
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court
Judge Conley's popularity Is well attested
The battle in the Sixth, therefore, prom,
ises to be one of the most interesting
political struggles In the history of Cal
ifornia.

TACOMA, March 6.â Dawson advices
cay that Charles W. Eaton, who died last
month on Hunker Creek after being
struck on the head by the falling of a
bucket, was the last of four partners
who died within one year.
During 1900 and in the early part of 1901
Eaton operated in the\Klondike district
with Fred Johnson, Al Younger and Jerry
Heater. All of them were industrious and
thrifty and they made and saved money.
Fred Johnson died last spring at Hoota
linqua after severe exposure. Al Younger
went in over the ice and on arrival Â¦ at
Dawson . was stricken with pneumonia
from the effects of exposure on the trip.
He died in St. Mary's Hospital. Jerry
Heater cared for Younger at the hospi
tal and he himself became sick - about tho
time of Younger s death. Soon after he
died.
Eaton reflected on the fate of his part
ners in so short a time and felt some
mysterious foreboding which tempted him
to leave the Yukon. He made partial ar
rangements to that end, but later the
strange feeling wore away Â¦ and he re
turned to his mining. He was working at
the bottom of a shaft, when a descend
ing bucket fell twenty-two feet, striking
him on the top of the skull. He was
hoisted out and died that day.
Eaton was 33 years of age and had
been one of the best-known athletes in
British Columbia up to 1894, when/he went
to Alaska. Previous to that time he was
cashier for a large firm at Vancouver.
The Sailors' Union celebrated Its sev
enteenth anniversary last evening with a
! rilliant street parade and exercises at
Metropolitan Temple. Seven hundred
representatives of the organization
marched through the main streets of the
city. They carried flags, transparencies
and torches and kept step to enlivening
music 'of brass bands. Nearly 400 mem
bers were attired in sailor costumes and
presented a martial appearance.
The procession was led by Grand Mar
shal Edward Anderson, followed by an
advance guard of twenty-four men, cap
lained by J. Jiolmgren. A band of
twelve pieces followed, and in their wake
came the divisions in the following or
uer: Company A. Captain Frank John
son; Sergeants F. Finnerty and F. Jo
imnsen, delegates to the Water Front
Federation. Company B. Captain C. g"
Simonsen; Sergeants JB. Hamilton and D.
Palmquist.
Parade the Streets.
After parading the streets for two
lours thesailors marched into Metropoli
tan Temple amid cheers of their friends.
who filled the building. The meeting
was opened by Grand Marshal kdwara
Anderson. He stated that .seventeen
years ago. on the 6th of March. 1&Â». the
bailors' Cnion was organized among the
lumber piles of Folsom-street wharf. Â±ie
sX theunfon had grown until it stands
to-day one of the strongest labor organi
zations in the United States He : said
the Sailors' Union of the Pacific Coast
has a membership of 5000 and branches
or agents in every port on this coast and
in the East. Mr. Anderson then intro
duced Walter Macarthur as chairman of
ftie meeting. When the applause had
ceased Mr. Macarthur in part said:
The sailor as a man is as free as any man
thins of the past and a sailor will do his
duty without being forced. .,,*,â .Â»,Â«.,
On every anniversary we have held in twa
hall or elsewhere we have always had some
achievement to celebrate or g lorlf y. I bÂ«liÂ«\ e
this celebration is no exception to the rule
I believe every one in the hall realizes that
the events of the past year have been in even'
respect Just as significant as the events of any
year since the organization of the union. Ihe
Sallows' Union is a great organization. It is
admired and confided in by the working peopl?
of the United States. It is the greatest oi
ganlzation of its kind. We may eafely say
to our friends in this hall that the part taken
bv the Sailors' Union in the City Front fed
eration last year was a proper one, and we
should not be ashamed of it. W e ought to
be proud of it." and our action will redound to
the glory of the labor unions on the Pacific
Coast and the United States.
Ovation to Mayor.
When Chairman Macarthur introduced
Mayor Schmitz the vast audience arose
to its feet and cheered. The ovation was
a hearty one and was deeply appreciated
by the head of the municipal government.
Mayor Schmitz spoke as follows:
Mr Chairman, ladles and gentlemen and
fellow union men. (Applause.) This meeting
shows well for your seventeenth anniversary.
This magnificent turnout, considering that
most of your "members are not here, is really
a magnificent demonstration. Tears ago the
sailor was not looked upon with as much re
spect as was felt for other citizens. The sailor
was not held in the same esteem. He was
not considered to be on the same footing with
the rest of the community, but through your
organization and through the infusion of edu
cation ycu have shown that you are a factor
in the community. (Applause.) And what has
brought that about? Nothing more or less
than the educator who is among you and the
brains that have been exhibited by your chair
man. Mr. Macarthur. and Andrew Furuseth.
(Applause.) These names and many other that
you have among you are enough v to make any
organization famous. I expect great things
from the tailors. The poor "Jack tar" has not
received his just desarts. Â¦' Â»
When they had Chinese excluded from our
shores, they allowed them to work on the
EhlpB. manned and owned by Americana. We
are striving â and I am striving â to have them,
excluded from our shores and oft all Ameri
can vessels. I had to attend another meet
ing this evening:, but I would not have fore
gone the pleasure of coming here for any man.
I feel that you are all my friends and you
have demonstrated that in the last election.
1 know that beneath your Jackets beat the
hearts of noble. men, for in the last industrial
disturbances no one was more in the front
rank than the sailors of the Pacific Coast.
Therefore. It is with pride that I f-tand here
this evening and receive your plaudits, and,
ladies and gentlemen, and again I eay, fellow
union men,Â« I hope that at the end of my term
1 shall be as 'dear to you as I am in the be*
ginning.
Other Speakers.
Hearty cheers were Riven the Mayor at
the conclusion of his speech.) Ed Rosen
berg, secretary of the San Francisco La
bor Council, discussed labor conditions
on this coast. He was followed by Police
Commissioner H. W. Huttton, who de
livered a speech on topics of interest to
the assemblage. Ex - Congressman
Charles Sumner was enthusiastically re
ceived, and he dwelt at length on sailors
of forty years ago.
The meeting closed with cheering .ind
the uniformed sailors marched back to
their hall and dispersed.
Oakland Office San Fjanclsco CallÂ»
111S Broadway. March i.
F. M. Smith, who has been the principal
backer of the Realty Syndicate and the
man who was determined to secure pos
session of all the street railroads of Oak
land, which he has finally done under tho
name of the Oakland Transit Company,
appeared before the California delegation
in Congress in Washington yesterday and
nia.de a statement that he had floated a
bond issue of $10,000,000 in Boston with
which railroad extension in and about
Oakland was to be carried on.
Mr. Smith was endeavoring to secure
rights for his tunnel scheme from Oak
land to Goat Island, but whether this is
dene or not Mr. Smith's statement 13 re
garded as having a great deal of bearing
upen the recent announcements that have
been made by the Kealty Syndicate- in
regard to railroad terminals in Oakland.
Mr. Smith's tunnel scheme is regarded as
rather visionary, but if Mr. Smith has
floated $10.(XW,OOu of bonds it means that
not only wilr the terminus for the Santa
Fc system in Oakland be built, but that
an outlet will be built for that road into
tho Santa Clara "Valley.
It has been a desire of the Santa Fe
system to secure an entrance into tha
fcanta Clara Valley because of the large
iiinount of fruit shipments from that sec
tion. A right of way through Oakland
ciid into San Jose would have cost a
great deal at the present value of land in
and about Oakland. For ten years, how
ever, the Realty Syndicate has been buy
ing large tracts of land along the foot
hills of Oakland, and it could to-day build
a railroad from Emeryville nearly to San
Leandro over its own property. From
San Leandro to San Jose would be the
easy portion of the right of way to se
cure. It is said that the syndicate has
secured these tracts of land for very lit
tle more- than it would have cost to se
cure a right of way for a railroad.
To build a road through this land would
b<; as advantageous to the syndicate in
opening up its land as it would be to tho
railroad. From all indications it would
seem that the railroad development about
Oakland will not be confined to the north.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. March 6.â To-day* e stock mar
ket made a remarkable exhibit of strength In
epots. Several of the customary market lead
ers were included in the upward movement.
The strength of the market, nevertheless,
failed to carry conviction as to the genuine
ness of the demand which lifted prices to a
higher le\ - ei. As the advance gained headway
various outstanding short interests were put
under pressure and. bought rather urgently to
cover short contracts. The demand was so far
unquestionably genuine. Otnerwise there wai>
the appearance of manipulation. This was
partly <iue to the character of the stocks which
advanc*-d most conspicuously, i-tocks which are
not often heard from for weeks at a time on
Lhe exchange. Nor was there any tangible
' aewe to-day to account for their strerigtn.
either affecting them individually or the gen
eral situation. In fact, the conditions whicn
were made the basis of the bear argument
fearly in the v/eek continued in. force to-day.
But these were ignored. A very strong senti
mental effect was produced by the persistent
ehow of Btrpnjrth in Chicago and Northwestern
and the character of the buying, which lifted
it and which had every appearance of genuine
investment demand. It was this movement
which directly encouraged the heavy buying of
St. Paul and which leavened the whole mar
ket in the course of the day. It was supple
mented by similar movements in other high
grade closely heid etocke, euch as Pullman,
which rote an extreme 16 points; Chicago, St.
Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha 7. and a num
ber of less conspicuous examples. Northwest
ern itself touched 233. Pullman, General
Electric, Omaha and Chicago and Eastern
Illinois also made record prices to-day. -Out-
Bide of these the most notable movements of
the day were in a varied assortment of low
trade, obscure stocks. The movement u'tf
mately extended, however, to some of tlie
Â¦oft coalers, led by Pennsylvania and other
prominent stocks. The late dealings showed
the urual profit-taking and the closing was
irregular. Rates for call loans continued at
the higher level established during the week.
The announcement that the San Francisco
traction deal would be arranged without trans
ferrinf: money from the Sub-Treasury relieved
eome anxiety over the money outlook and re
vealed that the tentative inquiry in Washing
ton as to the facilities for transfer of $50,000,
000 to $GO.GOO.<X.'O probably were a strategic
movement having to do with the negotiation of
exchange on Pan Francisco In the market.
The bond market continued rather dull, but
was firm. Total sales, par value, $2,380,000.

The situation in Beans still hinges on. the
state of affairs on the river. Some of. the
Bean lands are submerged, while others are
threatened, and dealers .' fear '. that the acreage
there this. year, will' be considerably cut down
in consequence. Holders are inclined to ship
freely to this market to save their . stocks.
Prices remain about the same, and the demand
is lnsicnlflcant.

CHICAGO, March 6. â The "crop killer" was
the most Important factor again in wheat to
day, but his mutterings were not very influen
tial. Continued reports of bad conditions came
from Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and- Indiana.
Reports from the last-named State were par
ticularly gloomy. Statistical reports stated
that crop conditions were fair, notwithstand
ing the damage, reports. Cables were some
what improved and Northwestern receipts were
small. Dullness in trade, however, kept May
prices hovering closely around 70%c the
greater part of the day,. 1 May opened un
changed at 76%c, sold as > high as 76%c and
closed barely firm %c up at 76%c. An effort
to break corn had a slightly depressing Influ
ence for a short time.
Corn ruled slightly bearish after the some
what steady opening. Cables were slightly im
proved and early offerings were light. May
prices sagged to 61%c and closed easy 14c
lower at til%@GX%c. . . ";
Oats were dull. May closed steady, un
changed at 44 % c.
Provisions manifested considerable strength
in the face of large receipts and lower hog
prices. May pork closed 15c up, lard 10c up
and ribs 5c higher.

Poultry and Game.
Receipts of local "Poultry were more liberal
yesterday than for some time. About 90 coops
came in, but as there.- was no Eastern on the
market all kinds sold readily at the quotations,
which were slightly lower for most young

Batter is getting weaker eÂ»*ry day, and the
Exchange yesterday cut its prices lc, quoting
creameries at 24@28c and dairies at 17@27c.
Receipts are running larger than for a month
or' so back. The tendency is to sell, and deal
ers are predicting another cut to-day. â¢
Cheese is also in large receipt and weak.
Eggs have not i changed much during the
past day or so. The local market is still ex
cessively supplied, and the moist weather con
tinues to prevent cold-storing. There are a
few orders from the north, but not sufficient
to relieve the .market of its surplus. The feel
ing is very weak. â¢ . .
Receipts were 44,000 pounds, tubs and
36 kegs of Butter, 1500 cases of Eggs, 26,350

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Receipts of Oranges continue light owing to
the wet weather in the south, which prevents
picking. Orders for shipment to Honolulu per
steamer Saturday are limited, " but are suffi
cient'to give the market a firm tone for fancy
grades, while seedlings and choice and stand
ard navels meet with a steady local demand at
good prices, i Only 1 car of Oranges Is an
nounced for to-day's auction. Lemons and
Grape Fruit meet with ready sale and -fancy
grades of both are scarce.
Most of the Bananas which came to hand
per steamer from Honolulu on Wednesday
were green and were not placed on the mar

lower.

firmness during the past day or two. A buyer
has been making inquiries for a possible large

the market with a view to possible purchases
in the near future. Nobody seems to j know
much about it, but in view of the light stocks
on the coast it - takes Â¦ very little to make the
market very firm. Prices show an upward

NEW YORK, March Câ The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business was. lacking on the exchange to-day,
but the tone was cheerful, with South African
shares leading in the improved sentiment. The
better feeling was larsely due to the confer
ence of the three Boer generals, which started
a rumor that the War Office was in possession
of important news.' American stocks were idle
but firm until New York bid i up St. Paul
sharply on a rumor that the stock would be
put on a 7 per cent dividend basis next month.
Denver and Rio Grande was also' in demand
and the list closed at the top, with little do
ing, however. The money, market was pinched
on renewed bank loans and borrowed afresh.
The bank return shows that the bank has
been denuded to the extent of Â£2,750,000. Gold
to the amount of Â£800,000 has been received
from Australia.

The Merchants' Association sent com

that provisions be made in the specifica
tions for street lighting when the next
contract Is let that the Gaa Inspector
shall be authorized to order the street
lamps to bo lighted on any of the so-called
"dark nights" when such nights are rainy
or foggy. The association calls attention
to Ihe desirability of limiting the so
called "dark nights" when no lamps are
lighted to three nights Instead of five.
The association submits that the city
should not be in darkness and the com
fort and safety of citizens endangered be
cause the conditions of the weather on
tho3e nights are not what are anticipated

lighted every night during the year or

It Is said that information has been
received, that the child Is In \ the keeping
of Annie Boulton.iwho has lived recently
at the home of Mrs. Saint-Marie at 883
Eddy street In this city. Officer McMur
ray of the society says that Mrs. Saint-
Marie admits that Annie Boulton lived
with her some time ago, but says she has
now left the house.
Mrs. Dunn is said to be a woman of
slender means. Her husband died about
live months ago. Her child was born at
Mrs. Funke's Hospital three months later.
Sho states that while there Mrs. Funke
induced her to surrender the child on the
ptcmise that it would be. well taken care
oÂ£ by some people who wished to adopt
it. When Mrs. Dunn had recovered and
had earned some money she wanted the
child returned to her and sought out Mrs.
Funke for that purpose. The latter. It Is
alleged, refused to furnish any informa
tion as to the baby's whereabouts and so
the Investigation was instituted.
Secretary White of the Society for tho
Prevention of Cruelty to Children has
commenced a search for the 2 months
old child of Mrs. Dunn of Oakland,
who claims that the little one Is wrong
fully kept away from her. It is stated by

wasj3tated yesterday that Crowther was

When Crowther was presented with, his

indignant and haughty. He was given
until 2 p. m. on Wednesday. to settle; and
told that hia room door would be locked

Crowther Asked to Settle.
The suspicions of Landlord Robinson
and his .wife vthat Crowther was not all
that he represented himself to be were
aroused. They thought it strange that a'
"rich tea plunter'and banker," as Crow
ther claimed to.be, should have trouble
with his laundry over a single dress shlfrt.
Mrs. Robinson on many occasions heard
Crowther telephoning to a laundry, de
manding that his "dress shirt be sent
home at once," and she wondered .why
the guest of the hotel could not afford -to
have sufficient apparel without having' to.
Â«end a solitary. shirt to be washed', every
day. â¢. . \,
Landlord Robinson and his wife learned
a. few days 'ago that Crowther was in
debt to livery stable keepers and deter
mined to collect their bill for board and
room. - ';,.'â¢
After staying at the Knickerbocker. Ho
tel for one. month Crowther was' pre
sented with a bill for the balance owed
by lilm. and Landlord J. A. Robinson had
considerable difficulty in securing ita
liquidation. The account -was for $110 and
Crowther managed to pay $100, leaving
$10 due at that time.
Crowther alwnye ordered wine at din
ner, and/ one evening he gave a dinner to
a dozen of the younger society set,'- the,
scene of the festivity being the private
dining-room of the Knickerbocker Hotel.
Rumor hath it that wine Jlowed freely,
but "expense" was nothing to the young
man from Japan. â¢ ; , ', .â¢;.

"Del Carlo had as good a show as one
would care to see, but the only trouble
was that the ghost-wouldn't walk."
Numerous calls at the home of Del

as to where he was going, ana has not

mounted the stage after the show jnd
announced to the audience that another

evening, followed by > presentations on
Saturday and Sunday nights.
Wednesday night some 150 enthusiasts
from the Latin quarter, most of thf.m
"dead heads," appeared at the hall. Del
Carlo failed to put In an appearance, so
the musicians struck, and the manager
of the hall refused to let the curtain rise,
as no one had been paid from the star

made by the would-be singer being for

went out and so did the audience. The
