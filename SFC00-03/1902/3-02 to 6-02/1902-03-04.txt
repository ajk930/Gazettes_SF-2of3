no power to commit for contempt. Hut
while the doctor submitted willingly to
the questions, what ho did not remember
would hnve made n much larger deposi
tion than he made.
The doctor frankly stated thnt the
many exciting cveirta In which he had
participated since the beginning of these
negotiations had thrown a mist over hla
recollections, and he" could bring out of
the past only a few of the main events
of that time.
i But these main eventa were very im
portant, for Dn Pardee said that he and
Henry P. Dalton had conducted tho sec
ond and tho successful negotiations for
the purchase of the paper in their own
names, and that the stockholders and the
agent with whom they were negotiating
alwaya thought that they were to be tho
purchasers, and G. B. Daniels did not ap
pear as the purchaser of the stock until
the transfer was ready to be, made.
Dr. Pardee fenced about until Mr. Ach
waa compelled to ask him one general
question as to tho first negotiations, for
the attorney found that to extract the In
formation by. questions would have taken
more than the day given to the taking of
the deposition. Many times during tho
day the attorney and the doctor meas
ured their wits, and it was only by the
most adroit work that Mr. Ach secured
any information of value. But what ho
did get was now to the ease and decid
edly interesting to thoeÂ« whoÂ»have been
watching its progress.

were torn from many of the fine old trees,
ornamental shrubs were uprooted and
some of the flower beds utterly spoiled.

SUISUN. March ?..â Again have the
farmers of the lowlands of eastern Ho
luno County and the islands cf the Sacra
mento River suffered defeat in their at
ttmpts to farm reclaimed lands. The
heavy storms and the high water of the
past week have brought hundreds of
thoupands of dollars damage to them.
The immense levees constructed last year,
which were expected to prevent any re
currence of pa3t losses, have crumbled
away and allowed tho waters to destroy
the crops on vast tracts of rich land.
Thirty thousund acres In tioiano County
are covered by water and nearly all the
islands are submerged. The water was
higher at Rio Vista this evening than It
had been at any time since 1862..'..Steam
boats have been engaged In rescuing
Stock ' from 1 the Unruled districts . and
taking it to the highlands. Many cattle
and other animals have been lost, but
how many cannot yet be ascertained.
Water covers the wharves at Rio. Vista
and Isleton more than a foot deep and
passengers from the steamers are carried
to dry land by boat crews.
Grand Island was not flooded at 7
o'clock this evening, but the water wan
not far from the top of the levee. Con
stant watch is maintained to prevent a
break. The products from this island last
year yielded $500,000. Ryer Island, on the
Solano County side, containing 12,000 acres
of rich land, is submerged, although new
Ievee3 were constructed last year at im
mense expense and were expected to with
stand any high water that might come.
A conservative estimate places the loss
of crops alone at $300,000. -

Von Bulow Makes a Statement Con-
BERLIN, March 3.â In the Reichstag
to-day Herr Hasse, Liberal, referring to
tho visit of Prince Henry to the United
States, said ho was glad to see it had
frustrated the deslgntt of Great Britain
against a German-American understand
ing, but that the German element In tho
United States was a power which would
not and should not build up a state within
a state. *
Herr Gradcnauer, Social Democrat, ridi
culed the Idea of any advantage arising
from Prince Henry's visit. He said it
was very Ingenious to expect any Im
provement in the relations between Ger
many and the United States to result
from such a Journey. Â¦ â¢â¢ â¢ â¢â¢ Â¦
Replying to Herr Gradenauer, Count
von Bulow said he deeply regretted the
remarks of the last. speaker, especially In
view of the splendid welcome that Prince
Henry was receiving from tho Americuu
people. This remark, of Count von Bulow
was greeted with applauao from all Bec
tions of the house. Continuing, the Impe
rial Chancellor eaid that the Journey of
tho Emperor's brother had no political ob
ject save the natural one of upholding
the traditional . good relattons. between
Prussia, Germany and the Onited. States,
which had existed since .the days of the
great and the great AVashlng
ton. He continued: ." -
Both nations have every reason for mutual
esteem. They have no occasion whatever to
besmirch one another or dispute with . one an
other: They have every Interest for living In
peace and friendship, . baaed upon complete
reciprocity, even In the most remote future.

now convinced. I am not saying this for Ger
many alone, but also for abroad. â¢ I am - fu-

Sing the Battle Hymn.
The orchestra struck up again with the
stirring strains of "The Battle Hymn of
the Republic, sung by the members of
the Ladles' Choral Society. The song
was beautifully rendered for a chorus
comprising so many members, and th"
audience was wrought up to a high pitch
pf enthusiasm. This was increased an
instant later, when, with scarcely an In
stant's pause, the music swung into "The
Star-Kpangled Banner." Instantly everv

SAYS LYNCHEES WILL
NEVER BE CONVICTED
What Is peculiar "in the face . of those
denials is the fact I that for some time
there has been talk among well informed
financiers of a possible organization of a
company in England or 'Canada for the
jidministration of the affairs of the
Northern Securities Company if an ad
verse, decision of the courts should invali
date the merger. Â¦ It Is argued by these
men that this holding corporation- was in
no way connected with the operation of
the Great Northern and Northern Pacific
systems, which between them control the
Burlington interests. '
â¢ With the consent of the stockholders
who . have invested in the merger securi
ties, ' the â¢ control exercised by tho combi
nation can . not be directed from foreign
soil so far as the administration and the
advisory officers are concerned. The in
vestors, however, who are unfamiliar
with the corporation laws of other coun
tries, went into the merger as a com-
S any formed under the laws of New
ersey, and according -to the opinion of a
well-known financier will be opposed to
taking extraterritorial chances which
they had not bargained for.
President Hill of the Securities Com
pany was not content with a denial of
any international charter,, but wished to
be quoted as saying he had never heard
of the plan before its publication.
, "I think I have a fair idea of what the
company is doing," he said. "I know
nothing about tho Canadian charter.
This Is news, to me. That is all I wish to
say. It seems to cover the ground."
George W. Perkins, of J. P. Morgan &
Co. said ho had heard nothing of such a
plan. . -"It Is possible," ho added, "that
independent lncorporators, acting on
their own responsibility, have applied for
a charter under the namo of tho Northern

The indorsement of the Daniels note at
the Central Bank 1 . was gone into. It took
a lot of questions on the part of Mr. Ach,
and tho doctor would not givo any details
of the Incident. He onlyloiew the main
facts, that ho had Indorsed a noto i6r Mr.
Daniels for 555,000, in 1898, at the Central
Bank in Oakland. Th<5 date of the indorse-*
ment he did 'not remember; he had not
negotiated the loan grom tho bank, and
â¢thought that the interest was 6 or. 7. per
cent. The noto, was/ made payable in a
year from date. As He had never received
any demands from the banlt for. principal
or interest, he presumed that the arrangre
menta made between the ? bank ao^d . Mr.
Danlol3 .were satisfactory. He had never
made any investigation into the financial
condition of Mr. Daniels, and when Mr.
Dalton indorsed the note with him there
was no asrreement between them as. to
the amount ! of responsibility . each I should
assume. .There had once been a conversa
tion between the doctor and Mr. Palman
teer of .the Central Bank abqut this note,
but s the j conversation .was so unimportant
that Dr.', Pardee did nof remember It.',
: Dr. *.'; Pardeo disclaimed , any knowledge
whatever as to where the money â¢ to Â¦ pay
the Â¦ interest was coming from. He said
that he had never, received any . securities
from Mr. Daniels as agralnst his obligation
upon- the' note, and since hia^ indorsement
he; had never asked ; Mr. Daniels for any
financial statements of the paper's condi
tion.>.Dr. "Â¦; Pardee -said-, that he -did not
know what salary Mr.; Daniels was draw
ing until -he -read It in Mr.. Collins*, com
plaint. â¢-. The last questions r were upon
what Mr. Daniels Â¦; knew; about the news
paper business," and the deposition ! ended
with -Dr. Pardee. offering to "give up the

hadbeen taken up.-, This will probably end

Dr. Pardeo owned to the fond impeach
ment of Mr. Ach that he had written for
the papers. He said that at different
times before the purchase of the En
quirer by Mr. Daniels he had written ar
ticles for It during a bond light and' sev
eral political fights and a number of arti
cles on water.
,, D Jf; Pi ""deo admitted that as far as
Ilndley know in these Interviews ho and
Dalton wore to be the purchasers.. Dan
iels not appearing in the transaction.
Kept Daniels' Part Secret.
: lels? A^â The fact that Mr. Hadley said that
the majority of the stock was for sale, and
.wanted to know If I wanted to buy it.
Q. â You then went to your.f riend.Mr. Dan
! iels, and told him what Mr. Hadley had said,
and was it then and at once that he asked you
to become his agent in the matter of the pur
chase of the paper or the stock? A. â I think
it was right off the bat.
Q. â What did he say to you that caused you
to conclude he had reached the conclusion that
he wanted you to act as his agent? A. â Why,
he told me so. ' '.Â¦-â¢Â¦Â¦. . â¢. i
Q. â What language did he use? A. â Why, I
think he said, ."Go, buy It for me." -.

you should buy and "every thing . of that kind?

traordinary and envoy plenipotentiary.
' Q. â You then started in .negotiations, with
whom? A. âHadley. Â¦
Q. â Now, you went on with these negotia
tions yourself with Mr. Hadley? A. â 1'es, and
Mr. Dalton was also interjected asraln. â¢
Q. â Did you' meet Mr. Nye or Mr. Leach in
connection with it then? A.â No.
Q.- â What was It that Mr. Hadley was en
deavoring to sell and you: to purchase? A. â
Stock in the Enauirer. : ..-
Q. â You then, did you, examine Into the af
fairs of the corporation? A. â I had already
done that through these reports that' were
made by Daniels and Williams.
Q. â Did you make any further investiga
tions? A. â Ncne. except what Hadley told me.
Q. â What did he tell you? â¢ A. â Well, he
grave me, as I remember, a statement of ' the
affairs of the corporation.
Q. â Do you remember what that statement
was? A. â I do not.
County Assessor Dalton was "Injected"
into this second stage of the proceedings
at the request of Mr. Hadley, because he
would- be a good man to have back of the
purchase.
. Q. â How did Mr. Dalton happen to be pres
ent at that interview? A. â I think it was at
Hadley* s suggestion, either at Hadley' s or my
own, which I don't remember.
Q. â Had you mentioned Dalton In connection
with the matter to Hadley? A. â I think Had
ley mentioned him to me first.
Q. â In what way? A. â Well, 'that it would
be well perhaps to have Mr. Dalton in.
Q. â What was Dalton in for? A. Well,
now, I don't know, unless it was on the propo
sition that Mr. Dalton also had some financial
standing in the community and would be a
good man to have back. I don't remember,
though. - . Â¦
Q. â Back of what ? A. â Back ot the pur
chase, aWKMH
DR. PARDEE GIVES HIS DEPOSITION IN OAKLAND ENQUIRER SUIT
that Daniels and I met: might have been the
third time or the fourth time, but about that
time.
Q. â Who mentioned It then? A. â First re
membrance that I have of it was Mr. Dalton
himself.
Qâ What did he say? A.â Well, that Mr.
Daniels had spoken to him about indorsing his
note (Mr. Daniels was present at that time),
and that he had told him Just as I had, that if
Daniels could show him that it was a payit.g
proposition and Rood from a financial stand
point, that he (Dalton) wouldn't have any
objection to Indorsing his note.
Q. â Was the amount mentioned then? A. â
I think not. â¢
Q. â Was It then agreed or understood that
you and Dalton were to indorse the same note?
A. â I couldn't say as to that.
Dr. Pardee had parried the questions so
successfully that Mr. Ach- finally said:
Q. â Doctor, would you prefer to go on in
your own way and tell your entire connection
with this thing?
Collins Had Last Say. /
A. â Why, I have- no objection in the world
to doing that. I think I have detailed to you
up along, say the third or fourth conversation
when Mr. Daniels asked me to Indorse his note,
and brought in Mr. Dalton, who also said he
would Indorse the note If the thing were made
to show up in good shape, which was after
ward shown to my satisfaction; and it . was
then agreed that' under those circumstances
Dalton and myself would Indorse the note,
(soon after that Mr. Daniels said that he had
been consulting with Leach and Nye and Col
llne; that they had agreed to sell him the
stock. The amount I have forfrotten, ' whether
it was $55,000. or $35,000. or $10,000. or $50.
I don't remember; and that Mr. Collins, who
had the final say. or veto power in the matter
was to give him an answer, I think, the next
day. The next day; .or the next day after that,
or within a very few days. I eaw Mr. Daniels,
and he Eaid that Mr. Collins had fallen down
at the last moment and had vetoed the sale.
In the meantime, or shortly after, or shortly
before Mr. Hadley came to me and said that
a majority of the stock of the Enquirer was
for sale; wanted to know, if I wanted to buy
It. J told him I did not. He said he would
see me again, and as soon as I saw Daniels
I reported this conversation to him, 'and .he
asked me then if I would act as his agent to
purchase the stock, at K I were purchasing
it for myself. I told him I would. Next time
I saw Hadley negotiations were, opened ' up,*
and cither at Hadley 1 s suggestion or my own,
which I have forgotten. Dalton was again In
terjected and negotiations dragged along for
some little time; and finally. I think, that at
Dalton' aâ or at Daniels'â suggestion It was
suggested to Hadley that H. N. Dalton secure
an agreement from Leach, Nye and Collins for
the sale of the Btock to H. N. Dalton: and I
undtrstaild that was done, although I know
nothing about it of my own knowledge; that
the agreement was given and that H. X. Dal
ton, who was acting as Daniels' agent, secured
the agreement, and Immediately upon secur
ing it turned It over to Unnlelu. Upon this
agreement, which I never saw at all until the
Wednesday preceding the Friday upon which
Daniels' deposition was begun, upon this agree
ment Daniels secured the f>00 snares of stock
which he now owns. That in a general way
Is all I know about It.
"Bight Off thÂ« Bat," Says Pardee.
Then Mr. ACh waa compelled to resort
to questions once more, and tho - doctor
told how he got Into the negotiations in
person. The questions and answers fol
low:
Q. â Then, doctor, the original negotiations
fell through by reason of the . protest or the
veto* on the part of Mr. Collins? A. â That is
my understanding.
Qrâ Mr. Hadley came to you, as I understand
you, an4 asked you whether you desired to pur
chase the paper? A. â His first statement was
that the paper was for sale and then he asked
mÂ« If I would purchase.
Q.â Tou said no? A. â I said no.
Q. â Tou then reported that matter to Mr.
Daniels? A.â Tes.
Q. â And what was your report to Mr. Dan-
joint interview, speak to you about Dalton in
connection with the Enquirer? A. â I couldn't
tell you â I don't know.
Q. â You don't remember. XVa6 the fact that
Mr. Dalton was there to participate In the dis
cussion at that time, as you now remember,
a surprise to you? A. â No, I don't think It
wac.
Qâ Had you spoken to Dalton yourself about
the venture? A. â I think not.
Q. â Was it by appointment you met him or
just casually? A. â That I couldn't say, either.
Q. â VVell, can you remember anything: that
-Sir. Dalton eaid at that . interview ? A. â Mr.
Uaiton generally don't say much, and my re
membrance Is that he didn't say much at that
Mr. Ach tried to apply the pump to the
doctor, but the latter was as agile In
evading the questions as A.ch was In" ap
plying them, and the attorney beat about
through the time covered by the third,
fourth and fifth conversations between
the witness and Mr. Daniels about the
Enquirer purchase, without obtaining
much. He got very few positive state
ments. One of these was that Dr. Pardee
had not investigated nor agreed to inves
tigate personally the condition of the
paper. Another was that neither he nor
Mr. Dalton was to become joint propri
etor of the paper, as Mr. Ach put it.
He had no separate conversations with*
ilr. Dalton about the matter, and never'
discussed the amount of the proposed
loan with Mr. Daniels. The doctor had
an "indistinct remembrance" of having
talked with John Williams about the pur
chase, but was not sure. Then came a
series of Questions about the statements
taken from the books of the paper by
John Williams, but the doctor only re
membered to have seen them. He did not
remember their contents. The examina
tion covering this point follows:
Q.â Did you ever see any statements of thÂ»
condition of the business made by Williams?
A.â Tee.
Q. â Where? A. â My remembrance la at Dan
iels' etore, although I am not certain of that.
Q. â How many statements did you see?
A. â Two.
Q. â Do you remember what they were? A. â

Q. â What became of them? A. â I couWni't

Q. â When was It that you saw them? A. â
In 'P7.
Q. â Caa you tell by whom they were exhlb

Q. â Can you tell who was present? A.â The

Q.â Second time you saw them? A.â T think

Q. â Did you evw co ov*r them with Dalton

PACIFIC GROVE, March 3,â Gen r
eral Thomas J. Butler of Pres
cott, Ariz., one of the most widely
known pioneers of this coast, died
generally wherever he. went, taking part
in many of the events that made history
In those early times, and then as after
ward throughout his â¢ career he was
known as a man of ability and sterling
integrity. While a resident of Colusa he
was clerk of the .historic first court of
that county, and in 1S63 he was appointed
brigadier general of the California mili
tia, Fifth Brigade, by Governor Stanford.
AGeneral Butler's removal to Arizona
was occasioned by his appointment as
Territorial Treasurer by Governor Hoyt,
an office he continued to hold under Gov
ernors Fremont, Tritle-and Zulick. Dur
ing President Harrison's administration
he was Receiver of Public Moneys for
Arizona.
His retirement from public life occurred
about eight years ago, and since then he
has spent his time traveling through the
United States. He and his wife, formerly
Miss C. E. Blake of Boston, Mass., whom
he married ln'ISSO, came to Pacific Grove
in December last.
General Butler has been a high Mason

A Parliamentary paper was Issued to
night containing dispatches and reports
regarding the remount department in
South Africa. The paper is considered
the strongest indictment of Its own in
capacity yet issued by the War Office.
This paper shows continual conflict
throughout the war between the generals
at the front, appealing >for horses, and
the otttcials of the War Offlce, who wero
endeavoring to limit the number or.
horses sent out. When the war broke,
out the remount department in Cape Col
ony consisted of one otncsr, nity men, one
veterinary officer and 1300 animals, and
when the British reverses came a scratch
remount establishment waa nurrlediy got
ten together. This proved itseli uttc-riy
Incapable of dealing with the sudden de
mands. â¢It appears that in August, laytf,
iieneral Forrestler Walker wired home
that the opinion of experts was adverse
to mules. Again, in Uecember,. after the
mishaps to Lord Methuen, General For
restler Walker suggested that no more
American mules weie wanteci. After the
disasters to General Buller the Govern
ment first began an extensive purchase of
remounts and the strain caused chaos to
every regiment in the remount depart
ment.
After Paardeburg Lord Roberts wired
urgently for remounts, adding "Without
mobile forces I can do nothing- In tnia
country." â¢
Again on March 9, 1300, Lord Roberta
repeated his appeal.
ix>rd Lansdowne about this time waa
pressing Lord Koberts to forecast the
time wnen the supply of horses could be
diminished. After Pretoria was captured
in July Lord Roberts "thought tne sup
ply ot horses might be reduced 20 per
cent."
He soon revised this miscalculation,
however, and in August was urging the
Government to send more hurses. In the
meanwhile Lord Lansdowne was equally
urging, the necessity to diminish the de
mands for animals.
In November of 1900 Brodrick came upon
the scene with representations of finan
cial necessities and the suggestion "that
now the harder portion ot ..ne campaign
is over" the supply might be dimlmsned.
In March. May, June and July and Sep
tember of 1901 Brodrick wanted to dimin
ish .the supply of horses, Lord Kitchener
always replying that this was quite im
possible.
The parliamentary paper then set forth
complaints from the War' Office of the
wasting- of horses through the ine3Jciency
of the remount department' and Brodrick
wired in November, "We cannot continue
Indefinitely to send from 10,000 to 12,000 re
mounts a month to be used up by column
commanders In a few day3." â¢
The final dispatch given by the paper
is dated January 15, 1W2. It is from Lord
Kitchener and says that the number of
horses sent is satisfactory. The paper
refers to the American mules as being
the "best received from any source, mag
nificent workers and kept in condition, un
der the most adverse circumstances." The
American horses, the report says, varied
greatly, but the majority were excellent.
. .In Parliament to-day Brodrtck an
nounced that the Government was still
dispatching 13,000 remounts monthly,^Â»and
according to the Pretoria correspondent
of the Times remounts are still badly
wanted In South Africa.

Track Notes.
C^rw^ HE clear, pleasant weather came
Ii as a welcome change not only to
< the race-going public, but own-
JI ers, trainers and jockeys as well,
and the attendance at Oakland
yesterday showed a marked Increase. The
track was very heavy, which detracts
somewhat from the tone of the sport, but
by to-morrow wJH again be in Very fair
condition tinder Superintendent "Bill"
Fieldwick's ceaseless care. Doreen, Lode
star, Edlnborough. and Sea Lion/ all fa
vorites in the ring, moored to purses, and
the major portion of the bookmakers
passed a restless afternoon.
Golden Light, a maiden brother to Ex
pedient, was heavily played on the
strength of some fast workouts to win
the first event,, but failed to finish among
the first three.' Courtier, a X>\' 2 to 1 chance,
well ridden by Troxler, caught Harry
Thatcher in the run home, beating the
long shot a neck. Irate, the 6 to 5 favor
ite, lacked speed enough to gÂ«t to the
front early, finishing third.
On fcrm the Burns & Waterhouse filly
Doreen looked a good thing for the five
and a half furlong dash next decided, and
â¢with Ransch up fche scored easily at odds
cf i to 5. Larry Wilt took the place from
Estado, a 40 to 1 outsider. Senator Bruce
led Into the stretch, but was kept In the
deep going and faded away the last
eig-hth.
Johnny Bullman on Orosius, the 1 to 2
choice for the two-year-old scramble, met
with some very rough racing luck soon
after the start. Away none too well, hÂ©
was endeavoring to sneak through On the
rail, when Jackson astride Mamie cut
him off. This compelled Bullman to take
his mount up, and at the close he .was
defeated -with, ease by Delsegno, piloted
by J. "Woods. Discharged ran third.

Kdlnborough the 9 to 5 favorite, care

glared Into submission, and assuming the
lead won by half a length from Jerid.
Prior brought Sir Dougal up when noth
ing was left but third money. The latter
was closing very rapidly on the leaders
and In a few strides more would have re
versed the order of things.
Betting on the last race was peculiar,
to say the least. Sea Lion looked a
healthy C to 5 chance, but because he
changed ownership, starting in the. name

Treasurer Miss Lizzie Douglass, and the
president of each of the local parlors.
After the usual business methods of .the
parlor had been gone through for the in
formation of -the grand president, there
was an exemplification of the initiatory
work, which was done- by President Cath
rlne McGough and her staff of officers in
a manner that has never been excelled in
any parlor in this city. So well was it
done, that the grand. president in her re
marks said that the officers could not be
too highly praised. After the close of the
work there were addresses by the grand
officers named and by each of the presi
dents. Then followed the presentation by
the parlor of a handsome gold and silver
salad Bet to tfie grand president and; a
nouvenir spoon Â¦ 'each to .â¢ Miss Keith. - and
Miss Frakes. I Then "the grand president,
on behalf of the parlor, presented a souv

and a bunch of carnations to Mrs. Steln

After the close of the* business session
there was an adjournment to the banquet
hall, which was a symphony of the colors
of the order: The tables "were profusely,
decorated with eschscholtzias and maiden
hair fern, in the midst of which were
many' delicacies. A programme of/ad
dresses had been arranged, but owing to

CLUB BOWLING TOURNAMENT.
Brandenstein's resolution that no permit
be granted to a club not three months in
existence was referred to the Judiciary
Committee. Curtis' â¢ suggestion that all
applications for boxing permits be re
ferred to the same committee was over
ruled, amid much laughter.
"I understand there is a combination of
two or three clubs to ctmtrol the fightinj?
business," said Boxton, "and for that rea
son we have selected an independent club
for next month's permit."
The vote on the resolution follows, ten
being necessary to adopt:
Ayesâ Alpers, Bent. Boxton, Comt?,
Connor. "Eggers, Sanderson, Wilson.
Wynnâ 9. â . .
NoeSv-Booth, Brandenstein, Curtis.
D* \ncona, I^ughery,* Lynch, McClellan,
Payot-8.
Excusedâ Braunhart.
Boxton expressed his displeasure at the
action of the board in vigorous language.
"Since the .board has seen fit to reject
the recommendation of the committee."
said Boxton, "there seems to be no reason
to make any further reports. I don't know
what a committee Is for unless it be to de
cide, on questions submitted to it for ac
tion."
D'Ancona's motion to grant the permit
to the Hayes Valley Chib was adopted.
Bent, Booth, Brandenstein. Comte. Con
nor, Curtis, D'Ancona, Loughrey, Lynch,
McClellan and Wynn voting aye; Alpers,
Eggers, Sanderson and Wilson voting no;
Boxton and Braunhart excused.
Eggers said it was the opinion of the
committee that the Hayes Valley Crub
had no mtire standing than the National
â¢ Club, and that the board's action in refus
ing to accept the committee's report was
unjust. Eggers also -charged that a coali
tion existed between the San Francfsco.
the Hayes Valley and the Yosemite clubs
to control the boxing business.
Supervisor D"Ancona stated that it was
understood that the National Club did not
comply with the ordinance, requiring any
club giving exhibitions to have a gymna
sium and a membership of 230. Supervisor
Boxton explained that the majority of tho
Police Committee had' recommended that
the permit be granted . to the National
C}ub. Supervisor Curtis said there wer^
so many clubs seeking permits that it
would be wise to comply with the or
dinance. Curtis said he believed that tho
Hayes Valley and the San Francisco Ath
letic Clubs are the only two clubs enti
tled to permits. Supervisor Brandenstein
opposed granting a permit to any club not
In existence for at least six months.
The resolution "granting the National
Athletic Club permission to hold a boxing
exhibftion In March was defeated by the
Board' of Supervisors yesterday. The
board then voted to grant the permit to
the Hayes Valley Club after considerable
wrangling.
"1 never bought a gold brick," said
Ferns yesterday, -"but one that was nice
ly, gilded | was handed to me at Portland
when -Tommy Tracey was. given a deci
sion over me. In that' contest Tracey
proved himself a sprinter and he breast
ed the tape ahead of me at all stages of
the game. He was pacemaker and ran
around the ring like a. chicken with its
head off. I'm a fairly good runner, but
he can beat me at that game. I suppose
the referee ' thought the . same g when he
gave the decision to Tracey. He must
have decided on sprinting ability. If he
had based his decision on aggressiveness,
and, .points 1 would, have been declared
the winner." Â¦ â¢ "' . : '
"How did you ' break into ; the boxing
game?". Ferns was asked.
./'Well, that's an easy one. I used to be
a, coal miner in Pennsylvania and was
considered husky for my size. One night
I was out with my chum and both of us
had been drinking. We 'butted' into a
saloon and. while standing at the bar a
fellow gave my friend 'the shoulder.' I
told my friend to punch the 'guy' in the
-jaw and the 'guy' turned oirme and said,
'I suppose you'd like > to do some punch-
Ing?' I was there like a duck. In a min
ute we mixed and I put this fellow out
of business. I afterward learned his name
was Mackey s\nd .he was chompion of the
State. We were matched to fight and I
beat him In ten rounds. That's how I
started in the nstic game."
"Where did you get the name 'Rube'?"
he Kvas asked. Â¦ :
"I was" matched to box Charley Mc-
Keever. in Chicago; and when I was intro
duced to the sports assembled in the
hall the announcer said I was 'Ferns of
Kansas.' Kansas is my home, you know.
Well, a big fellow seated close to the
ring yelled, 'He's a Rube,' but I proved
I was not by beating my man. After
that I took the name for advertising pur
poses." Â¦ . ,
Ferns is a stocklly built fellow. He 1s
broad-shouldered and partly bald-headed.
He bears marks of battle on his face, but
otherwise might be taken for a halfback
on a college football team. "He is anxious
to secure another match with Erne. He
knocked out the " lightweight champion
in nine rounds. They boxed at 142 pounds.
Ferns said Erne could beat all the light
weights in the country if he fought
them. He says Frank has the punch and
can take a beating.
Ferns will. train at the Cliff House for
his coming bout. Â¦
/"Bube" Ferns, the -* champion welter
weight boxer/ who came .here, to' battle
with AI Neill at Mechanics* Payilion on
the evening of March 21, declares he. is rto
"farmer." He proves his assertion by
saying he never. tilled the soil, and that
instead of beins. a "Reuben Glue" he is
as "wise", as a college professor. .

Rev. Marguerite St. Omer Briggs, 35
Mount Calm Street, Detroit, Michigan,
Lecturer for the W. C. T. U., recommends
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
''Dear Mrs. Pinkham : â My professional work has for the past
twenty years brought me into hundreds of homes, of sickness, and
I have had plenty of opportunity to witness the sufferings of wives
and mothers who from want, ignorance or carelessness, are slowly
but surely being dragged to death, principally with female weakness
and irregularities of the sex. I believe you will be pleased to know
that Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound has cured
more women than any other agency that has come under my notice.
Hundreds of women owe their life and health to you to-day, and, there-
fore, I can conscientiously advise sick women to try it." â Marguerite
St. Omer Briggs. /
$5000 forfeit if the above letter is not gexurjte.
When women are troubled with irregular or painful menstruation,
weakness, leucorrhcea, displacement orulceration of the womb, that bear-
ing-down feeling, inflammation of the ovaries, backa'che, flatulence,
general debility, indigestion, and nervous prostration, they should
remember there is one tried and true remedy. L.yclia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound at once removes such troubles.
iS T O t other medicine in the world has received such widespread and
unqualified endorsement. No other medicine has such a record of cures
of female troubles. Refuse to buy any other medicine.
3Irs. Pinkham invites all sick women to write her for advice.
She has guided thousands to health, a ** ?â¢r^ r T- W"".

For her we havo Imported In a single yenv

In a recent speech David Bennett Hill said Roose
velt will be rcnominated in 1904 and that New York
will be the battlefield, all % of which is probably true,
but New York will not be the decisive point of the
battle, for Roosevelt can get enough votes to elect
him without" New York.
The riot* in Barcelona turnout to hnve been not so
much a labor strike as a revolutionary movement,
and consequently the use of the army in suppressing
them can hardly be deemed an act of despotism. The
Spanish Government may not be very good, but it
certainly has a right to protect itself.
"Tho Danish 'nÂ«w woman,' " says a se
vere critic of her order, "Is ever jealous of

realizing them . arc frequently theatrical

the sex for many centuries. Roman
women wore wide bandages, which were
valued as giving to the form an appear
ance of Bllghtness. In Germany and sub
sequently In Franco women wore an arti
cle of dress that was very much llko tho
corsets of the present day. It contained
rods and plates of whalebone and steel
and was designed "to conceal the defects
and exaggerate tho beauties of the figure. '
CcrÂ»ets can bo traced back to the thir
teenth century, and they found their way
into England in the latter half of th*
fourteenth century. ,-J

Recognizing that there is needed some method of
estimating the growth of population between census
years, the statistician carefully calculated the figures
of the seventy-eight cities under investigation anÂ»i
came to the conclusion that a method more accurate
than cither of those in vogue is: "To add to each
year after 1900 one-tenth of the city's increase from
1800 to 1900." This, it is admitted, "is a mere rule
of thumb without rational justification," but, the stat
istician pays the average Increase In the cities between
1890 and ipoo was in that proportion, and that "if
this method had been applied to the cities for 1900
the .resulti in half the cases would have been within
6 per cent of the truth."
Summing up the results obtained from the whole
study, the report concludes that Dr. Samuel Johnson
was right when he said: "To count is a modern
practice; the ancient method was to guess and where
numbers arc guessed they are always magnified." It
adds: "A combination of. counting and guessing is
better than a guess not founded on a count, but when
it differs from the results of a thorough and complete
enumeration it is entitled to no standing."
The number of children' of school age was foundto
afford a safer basis for calculating Â¦ population than
cither of the two preceding assumptions, but even
that is unreliable. Where the school census is taken
with a high degree. of accuracy, calculations based
upon it come within 6 per cent, of the truth, but the
report says: "The number of children of school age
in a city is so seldom given with close accuracy by a
school census that this method is found of little prac
tical value." The common method of estimating pop
ulation from the. number of names in a city directory,
the report says, "results uniformly in too large a
figure and usually in very serious inaccuracy."
The report shows that in fully half of the cities un
der examination the per cent of growth between 1890
and 1900 differed by as much as 18 from the per cent
of growth between 1880 and 1890, consequently all
estimates based upon the assumption that the rate
of growth would be constant were valueless. Equally
Inaccurate were the estimates based upon the ratio
of voles cast at. elections', :- since there are sonic cities
where the population in. 1 poo had but four inhabitants
for each votccast, while in others 1 there wcjc' twelve
inhabitants for each vote. : v
CENSUS BULLETIN No. .135 contains a
careful study by Chief Statistician Wilcox of
the comparative accuracy, of ' the various
methods employed in estimating the population of
cities. There arc four methods in vogue for 'such
estimates. The first assumes that the rate of growth
in 'any city between' any two successive censuses is
maintained during the following decade; the second
assumes a constant ratio between the total population
nod the vote castj'the third assumes a constant ratio
between the t6tal population and the' number of chil
dren of school age; while the fourth assumes a con
stant ratio between the total population and the num
ber of jiamcs in the city directory.
For .the purpose of testing the accuracy of these
methods the statistician compiled the figures of sev
enty-eight cities, each having more than 50,000 popu
lation/chosen from every section of the Union. The
growth of the population'of each' since 1890 was cal
culated by the various methods stated and the results
compared with those obtained by the count of the
census in 1900. In no instance did the results 'ob
tained by any method of estimating approach the re
sults" of the count; with sufficient accuracy to justify
confidence in it as a means of calculating population..

T*HE action brought by a negro ex-convict'.
â¢ against Warden Aguirre, at the instance of ex-
Convict King, will not get public sympathy
nor support King was supported in the movement,
he began while still in prison to aid ex-convicts in
getting employment and to encourage them in living
a better life. It was widely, accepted as the fact that (
his reform is genuine and his desire to aid those who
had wrought their own downfall by crime was genu 1
ine. "As wide as was this sympathy . with his move
ment so wide will be the disappointment that he
turns it into what all men know is a dangerous' attack
upon that salutary prison discipline which is the b'c
ginning of all criminal reform. The negro convict,
while in prison, disobeyed discipline .by a desperate
combat with a fellow prisoner. For this both were
straitjacketcd, and the negro alleges serious phy
sical injuries as the result of wearing that correc
tional costume. King gives out that this will be fol
lowed by many similar charges against Warden
Aguirre made by convicts who arc still in the prison.
The most serious misfortune that befalls convicts is
the feeling of license to make such an attack upon
prison officers. When assured of public sympathy in
such a course there is no end to the lengths to which
they will go. Men are not in prison for their virtues,
but for their vices. They arc there because they have
broken and defied moral and statute law. They were
guilty of that breach because of absent or blunted
moral sense. By a majority of them their conviction
and confinement arc regarded as interference with
their personal rights. The prison officers are looked
upon as enemies against whom they may do any act
of revenge for which there may be opportunity.
If such a movement as King has started begin on
the outside and progress in the safe keeping of pub
lic sympathy, there is offered the best opportunity
for discrediting the prison authorities and satisfying
a desire for revenge. There is no end to the capa
city of some convicts for invention in such a case.
The talc devised by the most ingenious is strongly
and readily supported by others, until, in the view of
people unaccustomed to study of the criminal miqd,
there appears to be a preponderance of testimony
against the accused officer that outweighs his denial.
Meantime the prison is in a ferment. Discipline is at
an end. Every moral influence is suspended. What
ever reform has begun in individuals is set back and
great injury follows.
, As for King, his alleged declaration of, purpose in
the prosecution of the Warden will not only alienate
sympathy and support from his effort to secure
amelioration of the condition of the ex-convicts, but
will disincline the public to give support to a similar,
movement from a like source in the future. If he
were sincere he would sec this and refrain.
MASSACHUSETTS FARMING.
WOMAN AND WORK.
Prince Henry of Prussia has given New York many
pleasant compliments, but President Eliot of Har
vard has just said that the impression made on him
by his recent three days' visit was one of "absolute
ugliness.and squalor." Thus docs Boston. keep watch
and see that the New Yorkers do not become intoxi
cated with exuberance of'delight over the commenda
tion from Berlin.
STATISTICS relating to farms and farming in
Massachusetts show in a striking way the
changes which have been effected by Western
competition in grain-growing and the' efforts of the
New Englanders to develop other forms of rural in
dustry. In 1850 Massachusetts had 34.0G9 farms, con
taining in the aggregate 3,356,012 dcrcs, of which
2,133.436 acres were under cultivation In 1890 the
number of farms had increased to 37,715, but the
aggregate acreage had decreased to 3,147,064 acres,
while the cultivated area had fallen to 1,202,132. Small
farms have taken the place of large farms, and on
farms of nearly all sizes an increased acreage has been
allowed to go to pasturage.
When the total improved acreage of farm lands in
a State decreases at that rate the natural impression
would be that the total value of farms had also di
ninished. In this case, however, it is not so. While
only 41 per cent of the acreage given to farms in
Massachusetts is now cultivated, as ngainst 63.4 per
cent twenty years- ago, and while (he absolute
diminution in improved acreage amounts to nearly
i.oon.ooo acre?, "the aggregate value of farms in the
State in tyno wan $18^,646,704, as against $121,033,641
Grain-growing appear* to have been well niRli
abandoned. In iHyg the entire area in MaÂ»sachu
f>rttÂ» devoted to wheat' was only ninety-five acre*.
Other grain f/opi iverc not quite 10 t-inall, but none
the Icm there jiai been a heavy decline in nil of them.
Dairying nnd market-gardening have advanced at
well Â»* other form* of Intensive farming. There has
been a notable development in fruit-growing. The
figures of that industry for 1890 and J900 arc thus
yjiven:
Â¦ â¢ .
Applr*. tnÂ»oÂ« 1,852,010 l.C97,KÂ»l
Apricots in 403
Cherries 17,258 14.43S
Pfjchr* 301,4Uo N S7,004
Pears 148.503 138,348
Plumo and prune* 49,4:12 17,296
The explanation of the growth of the fruit indus
try is that it is not so subject to Western competi
tion as grain-growing. How long that will remain
true is a question, of frefght rates, for the Pacific
Coast is quite* able to suppjy New England with bet
ter and cheaper fruit than her orchards can produce.
It may be, therefore, that this promising industry
will have to give place later on to something else.-
That has been the experience in old England, where
extensive orchards were set out some years ago be
cause of the unprofitableness of grain fields, but
which in turn have become unprofitable by reason of
the cheap and abundant fruit now carried to British
markets from the United States and the south of
Europe.
The figures strikingly illustrate the thriftincss and
energy of the New England farmer. Faced by the
overwhelming competition of the rich grafti fields of
the West, he has not despaired of his own State nor
his farm. Abandoning to grass the less valuable por
tions of his acreage, he has made the rest more val
uable than the whole was before competition de
scended upon him. A race that can do that can take
care of itself no matter what happens, and when in
the fullness of time California fruit saves the New
Englandcrs from the necessity of eating frostbitten
peaches and ihc starveling prunes that, grow in that
climate, they may be relied on 'to ?cck other forms of
industry and still make their land valuable and profit
able.
Kipling's latest contribution to Uritish politics is
a statement that party govern ment in Great Britain
has made statesmen is karcc as the dodo and ended in
failure. As this follows <o soon upon his recent attack
on athletes. >it seems there is nothing in the empire
that suits him, and we may yet hear of him coming to
this country to find rest from his troubles.
C' ARROLL D. WRIGHT of the United States
Labor Bureau recently delivered to the stu
dents of Smith College an address on "The
Emancipation of Woman," in the course of which he
gave his conclusions upon many of the problems
arising from the tendency of women in our times to
enter into industrial competition with men. Mr.
Wright is a statistician. His theories arc based upon
statistics carefully compiled and his conclusions rep
resent earnest study of the facts and of their meaning.
What he has to say, therefore, upon woman's labor
is worthy of consideration from all who take any. in
terest whatever in that phase of our social develop
ment. â¢ Â¦
Woman became an important factor in the wage
carniug world immediately after the introduction of
the factory *yÂ»tem. Mr. Wright lays her appearance
in that field noon proved of benefit to her, for It whs
noted that her efforts were inefficient becuusc of her
ignorance, nnd steps were at once taken to educate
her. He attributes the existence of the sjB colleges
of liberal aril and 198 institutions of higher education
now open to woman in this country to the progresi
itic baa made in the industrial field, or, as he puti it,
to "the industrial prosperity nnd the stimulation
which conies frtfm active remunerative employment."
The advance in education and in industrial freedom
on the part of women has not been ttccompnnicd by
any loss of morals. Mr. Wright, after referring to a
belief that exists in dome quartern that "so far as
purely wage-workers jtire concerned the morals of
women arc not up to the standard of women under
the domestic system," said: "I believe this view to
be absolutely false and that the morals of the work
ingwomen of this or any other civilized country are
upon as high a plane of purity as those of any class
of women in the community. I make the statement
I have, however, upon positive investigation which I
have carried as far Us it has been possible. 'In what
ever direction I have turned my studies relative to the
moral character 1 of women engaged in industry the
result has been the same, whether those studies have
been conducted in this country, in Great Britain or
upon the continent of Europe." ,
The fact that women work along with men in fac
tories does not entail a failure of respect any more
than the fact that they arc educated together in col
leges. The Commissioner asserts positively that his
studies lead him to the conclusion that'"thc mingling
of the sexes either in -industry or in education docs
not work harm to society, but on the contrary brings
great good and secures that respect which is essential
to honorable social and family life."
Concerning the question whether industrial eman
cipation on the part of women tends to decrease the
number of marriages, Mr. Wright declares a convic
tion that it. has that tendency at present, but he be
lieves it will be temporary; and, that in. the. i fullnesÂ»
of time when the problem is fully worked out there
will be as many marriages as there ought to be. lie
says: "As woman has the power given her to sup
port herself she will be less inclined to seek marriage
relations simply for the purpose of securing a home
and protection." lie adds: ".I am free to say, this
docs not frighten me in the least.".
The fact that women do not receive in the labor
market equal wages with men is attributed, by Mr.
Wright not to an injustice, but to economic causes,
and he declares it to be the logical sequence of condi
tions of inefficiency which cannot be obviated until,
through a long process of 'industrial development,
women become veritably the equals of men in the
struggle for existence. Political emancipation, Mr.
Wright believes, will come eventually as a. result of
industrial emancipation. As soon as the mass of
women become self-supporting and free their right

SALINAS, March 3.â The store of the
Cooper-Ulr.ay Company at Kings City
was entered by burglars early Sunday

and as the result of a clew which he dis
covered on the premises proceeded to, San
Ardo, where he arrested five tramps.- A
number of watches, fanny goods and
pieces of. Jewelry valued; at $500 were

VANCOUVER, B. C, , March 3.-Con
trolllng forty-six salmon' cunnerlcs Out of
tho total of seventyolocatcd In British Co
lumbia, a eyndlcate/jf American capital
ists is completing arrangements for the
control of the salmon catch of next sea
son. Tho organization of tho canneries
has been going on for several weeks un
der the local guidance of Henry Doyle, a
canners' supply merchant, formerly of
San Francisco. To-day It was given out
that enough canneries had been secured
to make the organization a success and
the details of the deal probably will be
completed at once.
Â¦ More than half of the canneries in the
combine will be closed next season. For
three years the pack has been so large
that the market in the old country is
glutted with fish: Last season the can
ners did not make any profit, with compe
tition keen and prices low, and a large
part of the pack is still unsold.
Henry Doyle has interested American
capital to. the extent of 54,000,000 in the
combine scheme. A. Joint committee rep
resenting the purchasing syndicate and
the owners of the canneries will place a
value upon, the various establishments.
Then the cannery owners will be given
shares In the new company, as well as a
portion of the amount of the purchase In
cash. More than half of the canneries
will be closed so that the output will be
reduced and prices Increased. The com
bine is expected to be in working order in
time to control thin season's business.

SAN JOSE, March 3.â After incumber-
Ing the calendar of the Superior Court of
this county for more than twenty years
the case of Michael Cassln ct al. vÂ». Mur
doch Nicholson was decided by Judge
Hyland to-day In favor of tho plaintiff.
This case is one of the side issues of the
most bitter litigation ever carried on In
the State, and back of it is a story of
murder and a lynching*. V
The action decided to-day grows out of
tho case of Nicholson vs. Matthew Tar
pey. Tarpey was a prominent politician
of Monterey. In the latter part of the
sixties he sold to Nicholson a tract of
land in Monterey County. A quarrel en
sued over the boundary line and Tarpey
shot and killed Mrs. Nicholson. After his
arrest Tarpey was taken by a mob of
vigilantes and hanged to a tree between
Salinas and Monterey. â¢ ";
Nicholson brought suit in 1879 against
Tarpey's estate to have the boundaries
of the ranch over which they had quar
reled adjusted, and the suit of Cassin vs.
Nicholson, growing out of .the same af
fair, was commenced a year later. Both
actions wese transferred to this county
for trial. The first case was tried here
three times and Judgment given to Nich
olson, and each time the Supreme Court
reversed tho \declsion. A year ago. the
Â«ult was dismissed, and the second suit,
Cassln against Nicholson, which covers
the same issue, but is In the form of an
ejectment suit, was revived and brought
to trial. The decision to-day was against
Nicholson.

ENDS LITIGATION
OF TWENTY YEARS
SAN JOSE, March 3.-C. H. Phillip*,
one of the most prominent land
promoters in the State, was
stricken by paralysis at his homo
on the Alameda this morning and
died a few hours later. He had Just par
taken of a hearty breakfast, when at 7.W
o'clock he was attacked by paralysis. His
entire right side was affected. Physicians
were summoned, but he was so far gone
that death ensued at 10:30 o'clock with
out the patient having regained con
scious.
Mr. Phillips was a native of Medina
N County, Ohio, and 66 years of age. In tho
early sixties he came to California. After
a short residence In Napa Valley he re
moved to San Francisco, where for a
number of years he was a deputy collec
tor In the customs nervice.
In 1871 the West Coast Land Company,
which acquired a large tract of land In
San Luis Oblspo County, was organized
and Mr. Phillips was made its secretary.
The town of Templeton was laid out un-
MANY CANNERIES
WILL BE CLOSED
dor Mr. Phillips' direction. He moved to
that place, and, after Templeton had. been
established, he was interested In many
other large real estate deals. Mr. Phil
lips built the Hotel Ramona In San Luis
Ooispo,
About ten years ago Mr. Phillips came
to Santa Clara County and opened head
quarters in San Jose. He bonded the
Morgan Hill and San Martin ranches, be
tween this city ,and Gllroy, comprising
many thousands of acres, and sold the
property. In small tracts. The towns of
Morgan Hill, San Martin and several
other smaller places were laid out by
him. When the "hard times" of a few
years ago came Mr. Phillips was caught
with an immense amount of bonded real
estate on his hands and was nearly
wrecked financially For the past few
years he has done but little business.
Few men in Santa Clara County were
better known than Mr. Phillips. Besides
his widow, six children survive himâ Mrs.
R. W. Sanford of Santa Clara, -Mrs. Jo
sephine Vnchell, | Chauncey H., Chester
D. and Nelson B. Phillips and Mrs. Jane
Wlnningstad of San Francisco.

News from the East v was scarce, owing to
the general interruption to the telegraphic ser
vice by the storms. Chicago was dull, with
no disposition to operate. A dispatch from
Texas said: "It is very difficult at present to
estimate the damage to growing wheat In
Texas and the Indian Territory. The ground
is very dry and there has been no moisture
for almost six months."
The San Francisco market was naturally dull
In the absence of guiding news from the other
markets, and operators did very little trading.
Quotations were about the same. . *
Spot Wheatâ Shipping, $1 10; milling $1 12ft

WHEAT â Paris futures were lower. Liver
pool futures were about the same.* The world's
shipments for the week were as follows. In
quarters: Russian, 133.000; Danublan, 30,000;
Argentine, 79,000; Indian, 34,000; Australian,
77,000. The American' visible supply decreased
292.000 bushels.

Private letters from San Francisco dealers
to their New York correspondents place the

. Eggs declined again 'under liberal receipts
and excessive stocks.* Tljere was some nib
bling at the market by a shippec.'to the East,
but even If a car does go out it will make
very little difference now, owing to the very
large supply here. The north is now regarding
this market with more or less indifference, as
it is getting some supplies from Oregon. Local
dealers will commence storing now to relieve
the market of its excessive surplus. Tha Sound
steamer took out W>0 cases on Sunday, and the
carry-over Saturday night was 2900 cases, In
clusi\*e of those held by the fruit dealers. Â¦
The firmness in Butter continues. Spot
stocks are still meager, though there was rather
more on the market yesterday than for some
days back. The Exchange advanced its 'quo

Cheese Is easy, with ample-supplies, and

NEW YORK. March S. â There was some re
covery in prices in to-day's stock mar
ket, but the dealings were on a
â¢Â»ery small scale and still restricted
to operations by professionals of the
smaller class. The market reacted at the
close, on profit-taking, but the day's g^.ins were
rot all wiped cut. The traders who bought
stocks professed a feeling of encouragement
over the .favorable weather In the winter wheat
belt. There was also a very vague confidence
expressed in the future of the money market,
which seems to bs encouraged by the un
ruffled equanimity of that market In face of
the forces of depletion of the cash reserves
of the banks now,, at work. Another ground
for the buying of stocks was the showing
made by the railroads reporting their net
earnings for January, following those already
rf-ported en Saturday. Of those reporting to
day the most important was the Union Pa
cific, -which showed an increase of $730,(517 in
gross earnings for the month and $639,703 in
net earnings. Union Pacific stock itself made
but a slight response to this showing, but
it was an influence in the firmness of the gen
eral market. Little attention was paid to
the reports of damage and interruption to traf
fic by floods. The teports or disputes over
freight rates and passenger rates in thÂ» West
an 4u est w " ere equally without influence.
The Chicago and Northwestern stocks made
notable advances, the common rising 5 and the
preferred CVt on a light demand, said to be
for investment. Rock Island also rose 3H on
light transactions. Tennessee Coal was a feat
ure on a renewal of the gossip of buying for
control by the United States Steel Corporation
and it rose at one time 2M>. but lost about a
point. General Electric rose 3%: In some
f at *Tr. re were Ehar P reactions, notably in
the Minneapolis. St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie
stocks, the common losing WIK and the pre
ferred^ 1Â»Â«. The market closed easy at con
siderable recessions. Â¦? .-.,
The bond market v.as dull but firm. Total
sales, par value. $2.305, 00ft.

Meil advices from New York say: "A little
firmness is observed in some quarters on apri

Pales of choice Royals are reported at 10c.
but most holders are VÂ»c stronger, with fancy
fruit up to 12'jc. There is little buying for

25- fb boxes. Slies Â«0-70s are also showing a
little stronger tone, but on the 70-SOs and
S0-Â»i>s -we note no Important movement. There
Is a fair Inquiry for 80-100s and smaller fruit.
Oregon fruit shows a fair movement and some
firmness on the larger sizes, which are scarce.
"In raisins a little more Inquiry has developed
for seeded In cartons. Coast seeded Is held at
from SÂ»ic to 8 7 ic for choice and fancy, while
Eastern" seeded offers unchanged at 8Hc to

no Fpecial feature. In Valencia layers 4>/Â«c

Amalias In barrels, but we were unable to
trace the same to the source. The general

Los Angeles Vegetables'. were weaker under
heavy receipts.'.." Fancy .Â¦â¢Â¦Peas and Beans sold
readily at the top quotation, but poor stock,
which was "plentiful, was hard to sell. Re
ceipts of RHuharb were -14 boxes and prices
were lower. Asparagus also was slightly lower.
The Mexican steamer brought up VJ-Ui boxes of
Tomatoes . and OS boxes of Peppers. Very few
of the Tomatoes were sold, owing to the green
ness of the stock, but the market- was weak
owing to the large receipts from Los Angeles
and "the abundance of Mexican which came to
hand by thÂ» previous steamer.
The Onion market was weaker under large
supplies and . slow < demand. The top quotation
is lower. 'â¢.',Â»*Â¦'*; -~* : ... :Â¦Â¦

The floods along the Sacramento River have
placed the Bean market In an uncertain' con

by the freshets, they v.-ill be shipped- in here
in large quantities, when lower prices will
probably occur; , but if the Beans now there
become seriously damaged by water then sound
dry lots will have a tendency to advance sharp
ly. The conditions will not be fully determined
for several days yet, and meanwhile the mar

. The conclusion of the treaty â¢ was an
nounced to-day by Viscount Katsura, the
Premier, in the upper' house and Baron
. Komura, Minister of Foreign Affarls, in
the lower. '.The announcement was. re
ceived with tumultuous and unanimous
applause. Both speakers made a point of
the fact that' the treaty had received the
sanction oÂ£ the Emperor of Japan (and
1 that as it merely aimed at the mainte
nance of the status quo in the Far East
and general commercial^ facilities, which
had been favored by every nation, there*
could be no objection to it on the part of
the other powers. It is said that the
United Stages is even a silent partner In
i the arrangement . and that the treaty
powers are willing to admit any foreign
power to the alliance that is willing to
subscribe to its principles. Vernacular
pap6rs, while unanimously in favor of the
alliance, are strongly disposed toward
American co-operation, and the union of
the United States, Ensland and Japan is
generally referred to as the strongest pos
sible Dreibund in' the Interests of inter
national peace in the Far East.
On the announcement of the alliance
flags wero. displayed on many houses hera,
special editions were issued by all the
leading vernacular and foreign newspa

southeasterly gales, which increased in
violence until a full-fledged hurricane was
developed. Every sail that was set on
the Scottish Hills was blowi to ribbons,

The vessel is a small schooner and is
bottom up. Captain Johnson reports that
he was close enough to her to determine
that she was net the abandoned Laura
Pike. He believes she was only partly
iaden, as the wreck is pretty well out of
the water. The captain says that the
derelict is a serious menace to navigation
and warns masters to keep a lookout.
There is little doubt that the schooner
; turned turtle during one of the recent
Kales that swept the coast and that her
crew has perished.. ..

ljct is afloat off the coast of Oregon and
navigation is menaced by Its presence.
The name of the newly found wreck has
not yet been learned and whether or not
the crew has perished is problematical.
The derelict was reported to-day by Cap
tain Johnson- of the steamer Lakme,
vhieh arrived from San Francisco. It
was seen in latitude 45 21 north, longitude
124 12 west, about eight miles off Cape
Lookout.
Sights Wrecked Schooner.
The steamer Queen City was expected to
reach the derelict this afternoon, she hav
ing been seen leaving Albernl, but owing
to the fierce southeast gale which has
since sprung up she has been obliged to
run for shelter to Bamfield Creek. The
Queen City jvill arrive to-morrow.
The wrecked craft was evidently a seal
ing vessel, although which of the fleet
none could say. As the schooner Oscar
Â«.nd Hattie left Bamfield Creek, one hun
dred miles away, for Victoria on Tuesday
last, before the recent heavy gale?, and
has not been reported since, it is feared
that it was that vessel that was wrecked,
and that of her crew of twenty-eight
white men, shipped at Victoria, not one
has been left to tell the e^pry of the dis
aster.
This afternoon the operator saw a large
vessel steam around the derelict and then
proceed on her voyage, a fact which
makes it patent that the vessel had no
survivors on board.
The Oscar and Hattie was leaking badly
when she reached Bamfield Creek and
was ordered to come to Victoria by the
sealing company for repairs.
to-morrow when the bay steamer Queen
Cttjr reaches port. On Sunday afternoon
the operator at Carmanah Point sighted
a derelict all awash and In a helpless con
dition, the mainmast gone and the sails
hanging over the waterlogged hull. Two
jibs were set, and it seemed to the ob
eerver at the lighthouse, about eight miles
from the wreck, that in the forestaya of
the v.-recked schooner was the corpse of
one of the victims of the storm.

EL PASO, Tex., March 3.â A romantic
story of a little girl knidnaped eleven
years ago from this city and found re
cently at Potter College, Bowling Green,
Ky., has just come, to light here. The
girl, now grown to womanhood, is IS
j years of age and exceptionally '"pretty,
i The story reads like a chapter from a
i French novel. Ijl 1891, after a brief mar
j ried life, Mrs. Blanche Wade, one of the
j belles of the Southwest, obtained a di
j voree from her husband, Samuel Wade,
j and the custody of their two children,
j The divorce suit engendered much "bitter
j ness among the relatives of the husband
' and wife, and the court's decree greatly
j "angered the kinfolk of her husband. A
i few weeks later Samuel Wade disappear
! ed and with him his eldest child, Lucille.
I The case created a great deal of excite
! ment at the time. The mother was
i heart-broken and spent a small fortune
i in a fruitless endeavor to trace her miss
j ing daughter. Once she learned from
I American i tourists that the little girl in
; rags hadÂ»been seen begging upon the
â¢ streets of Chihuahua. Mexico. The Mexl
; can Governor issued an order for the
! restoration of the child to her mother, but
| before its execution the girl was spirited
I away. Subsequently it was impossible- to
I discover her hiding place. Two years ago
; Samuel Wade died in Mexico, "and, be
lieving the secret of her daughter's where
: abouts locked in the bosom of the dead
j man, the mother lost hope. Now comes
, the strangest part of the story. The dead
; man's sister recently quarreled with her
husband about an estate. Much blttcr
! ness resulted. While their divorce suit
; was pending and while the rancor be
l tween them was at its height, she sought
out the mother of the missing girl and
I revealed the entire story of the kldnap-
I ing to her. She said the child was at the
i Potter Institute. Bowling Green. Ky.,
I where she had been a student for three
j years. A communication from the mother
| to the college authorities brought a long
| letter from Lucille Wade and the photo
[ graph of -an exquisitely lovely young girl.

After being taken to the City Prison one
of the gang broke down and made a com
plete confession.. In addition to "work-
Ing" the hotels already mentioned he ad
mitted the youthful thieves robbefl two of
the principal hostelries In Los Angelos, se
curing valuable property. The arresting
"officers are strongly inclined to believw
that the quartet of crooks are responsible
for a number of hotel robberies commit
ted in. various parts'of the State. They
will be formally charged with burglary
to-day.
Altogether, it is claimed, the trio got
away with about $2000 worth of jewelry
"and other articles. Another of the gang.
who is said to be William King, has not
< yet been arrested, although he Is known
itcy the. police.
" ftmong the hotels that suffered* at the
hands of the gang are the Roanoke, Cum
berland, Argyle and the Bradbury.
Â¦The ' men arrived in this city a few
weeks ago from Portland, Or., and rente<l
rooms in a lodging-house at 333 Geary
street. On their way hÂ«re on the steam
er State of California they stole a lot of
silverware belonging to the vessel. Most
of the stolen property was found in their
rooms. After renting the apartments on
Geary street the landlady. . Mrs. Deane.
missed her purse, containing $110. She re
ported the matter to the police, and De
tectives Ryan and O'Dea were detailed to
find out what had become of the purse.
Satisfied that the prisoners were respon
sible for the numerous hotel thefts, the
detectives went to their rooms and placed
them under arrest. .
Locked up in the City Prison- are threÂ«
young men â¢who are experienced hotel
thieves. Their names are Oscar Murray.
Percy Kiernan and Robert Vance. They
are accused of stealing money and jew
elry from various hotels in this city. Their
method of operating was for one of them
to procure employment in a hotel Â¦which
they intended to rob and then tell his
"pals" the easiest way to "beat" it.
Antonio lived about twenty minutes.
He was shot in the right side. The
brothers were well known in this county
and Matt had the reputation of being
very quarrelsome. The Coroner's jury
rendered a verdict that Louis Kirch was
justified in killing his brother' Matthias.
He will not be prosecuted. Â¦"â¢Â¦' â¢ â¢Â»'- .'
Mrs. Kirch turned to Louis and implored
him to save his brother. Louis started
to step between Antonio and Matthias,
but the latter struck him with the barrel
of his rifle, and then, .raising the weapon,
fired point blank at Antonio. He turned
immediately with the gun still leveled
with the intention of shooting Louis, but
before he could work the lever for dis
charging the empty shell Louis fired at
him with the shotgun, the load entering
the right temple and killing him.
Matthias then turned and started to the
house, saying: "I'll kill you . all." He
went in at the front of the house. Louis
ran around the ; house and going into
Matthias' bedroom got his shotgun. The
latter had gone into the girls' bedroom
and secured a rifle. In the meantime the
women in the house had' been aroused and
were in the yard clinging to Matthias and
begging him not to shoot his brother.
Their entreatfes seemed only to enrage
the man further and he swore. at them
violently and threatened to kill . his
mother. . â¢ ' â¢
"You may be able to throw me, but
you can't lick me," and he struck tho
hired man with his fist. Matthias imme
diately â¢intervened, . saying such an as
sault was' not fair. Antonio replied in a
haughty manner and his brother cursed
him. Antonio replied in kind. Then they
went at each other with their fists. Louis
tried to stop the fight. Matthias struck
Antonio, who drew his pocket-knife arid
inflicted a vertical cut about three inches
long in Matthias* abdomen. ,
About 5 'o'clock j Mrs. . Kirch, their
mother, got up to prepare breakfast.
She noticed that, the boys, while appar
ently scuffling good-naturedly, were be
coming angry, and she asked them to
quit. The four men then went into the
yard*. A wrestling match, commenced be
tween Antonio and 'the. hired man and
the latter threw him. Then all com
menced to taunt Antonio about it, and
finally he jumped up and said:
. The particulars brought out at the In
quest were somewhat different from the
Â«4irst reports. It appears that on Friday
night Antonio and Louis Kirch, with an
other young fellow, * went with their two
sisters and a young lady who was vis
iting them 'to a dance at Copper King.
The boys commenced . to drink- and re
turned home in the morning drunk. An
tonio, Louis, Matthias and the hired man
went into the sitting-room and began to
wrestle in a good-natured way.
FRESNO, March 3.â Deputy Coroner
Cate, accompanied by District Attorney
Everts, returned yesterday from Copper
King, twenty-seven, miles from this city,
where, they had been to . conduct an in
quest upon the bodies of Matthias and
Antonio Kirch,, who were killed there on
Saturday. . ;
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Since the preliminary conference was
held in' this city last week between the.
delgates from the Sacramento Valley De
velopment Association and the Chamber
of Commerce, at which. representatives of
the Southern Pacific Company were also
heard, the possibilities of the situation
have been talked over pretty thoroughly
In all the region lying north of Tehachapi,
and anticipation is lively concerning â¢ the
turn that may be taken to-day. An Invi
tation has been extended to the State
Board of Trade to be represented at the
meeting. Secretary Fllcher and possibly
some of the directors of the board may at
tend. â¢ . . '
Some comment has been made by Inter
ior papers In the San Joaquin Valley con
cerning the fact that the San Joaquin
country was not represented at the pre
liminary meeting. The history of the first
conference is, briefly, as follows: The
Sacramento Valley Development Associa
tion invited the Chamber of Commerce to
meet Its delegates and the trustees of the
chamber complied with the request. A simi
lar request from the San Joaquin Valley
would undoubtedly also be met with fa
vorable action. It is probable that, the
final outcome of the conference of to-day
will include an invitation to the various
organizations representative of the sev
eral Hections of Northern and Central Cal
ifornia to co-operate. ,
At 10 'o'clock this morning committee9
representing the San Francisco | Cham
ber â¢ of Commerce, the â¢ Sacramento
Valley Development Association, the
passenger department of the .South
ern Pacific Company and the State
Board of Trade will meet In the rooms
of : i the Chamber of Commerce and
begin to consider the formation of a plan
under which the" resources of Central and
Northern California may be made known
to the people of the Eastern States and
Europe. The committee appointed by
President George A. Wiewhall to represent
the | Chamber of Commerce consists or
Charles M. Yates, Rufus P; Jennings and
G. W. McNear Jr. Very likely President
Newhall, at whose suggestion the confer
ence was brought about, will also be pres
ent. Â¦

- THE WAX PAPER TRUST
Chicago Financier Will Furnish All
the Necessary Capital for Start

CHICAGO. March 3.â Opposition to the
wax paper trust, which now practically
controls a business of about $100,000,000 a
vear is to be centered in a new company,
in which Chicago capitalists are interest
ed A charter will be asked for in South
Dakota within the next thirty days for
tho Wax Paper Company of America, with
a capital stock of $5,000,000. and factories*
will be in operation in four States. before
the end of three months. â¢ The ' so-called
trust Is known as the "Union Wax Paper
and Parchment Company,- and its hearl
nunrters are in New York. The new com
pany will compete with it by cstabllshinK
two factories in the State of New York,
ono.ln Now York City and the other in
liuffalo, and factories in Chicago, St.
I^ouls and Cincinnati. The Eastern fac
torleswill first bo put in operation. . -;Â¦ *
A system of making stockholders of
customers will be inaugurated by the new
company, and this is expected to result in
breaking the present combination. The
promoters of the Wax Paper Company of

WASHINGTON, March 3.â The sub-com
mittee of the Committee on Interoceanic
Canals to-day agreed-, to recommend to
the full committee that Â»the legal" cmo
plications surrounding the Panama offer
are such that the United States should
not accept It. The sub-committee consists
of Senators Morgan. Mitchell, Kittridge,
Pritchard, Foster of Louisiana and Tur
ner. Pritchard was not at the. meeting to
day while Senator Kittredge said he re
served the right to make a minority re
port to the full committee. The other four
members united in the recommendation.

Fry 6 ot Maine, chairman ef the Com
mittea on Cummercw, opened the defoftlo
In behftif of th# blU. He occupied the
floor for nearly two hours, 'i'he policy pt
protection, which has been applied, he
Maid, to American industries with such
beneficent results, hud not been applied to
the shipping industry. The result of this
shortslgntea policy nad been the decad
ence-oi the American merchant marine
and thd consequent humiliation of Ameri
cans engaged in the shipping industry. Me
asked who was going to carry the $487,
000,000 of exports in the event or a war
between Germany and Great Britain,
"Why." said he, "the farmers and the
manufacturers and the wage-earners of
tho United States would pay a penalty
equal to- that paid by either of the con
tending parties."
Frye then sought to show that this con
dition of things was caused by American
wages, which increased the cost of^ our
shins for the foreign trade at Jeast 2a per
cent. He declared that of all steamships
in the -world of fourteen knots and up
ward, 80 per cent are subsidised by
the countries whose flag they carry. Of
sixteen knots and upwards, he said, all
but six in the world are heavily subsi
dized by the countries '.whose flags they
float. The nations paying those. subsidies,
he declared, did so for the purpose of ex
tending their trade and for nothing else.
Frye declared that free ships, for
which some Senators were contending,
would meart an increase In cost of ships
of 25 per cent more than they now cost,,
and would : close every shipyard in the
United States against building any ship
for foreign trade. Â¦ '. " Â¦â¢ â¢/Â¦';â¢
Frye further said that the enactment
Of the pending bill would in two years in
crease the expenditure in American ship
yards ' $40;000,000. Our mail subsidies
amounted to nearly $3,000,000 a year and
would act 'as an offset to the $6,000,000 that
would be paid in subsidies , to American
shipping. Â¦".;Â¦ ' __ Â¦ . . 'Â¦
Â¦ At the conclusion of Frye s statement
Bacon of Georgia inquired as to the con
dition of business in American shipyard?.
Was.it true,', that they were full or
orders? . â¢
"It is not true," replied Frye.
In response to an inquiry . by. Clay of
Georgia Frye said there " was no law
now which -required that Americans
should be employed upon American ships.
The .pending bill,, he. said, provided that
during the. first year one-fourth- of the
crews of American vessels should be citi
zens of the United States; the second
year one-third and the third year one
- Clay and Bacon both insisted that- the
crews of the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany were largely Chinese and the. for
mer read the itestimony of the captain'
of the steamship China, of the Pacific
Mall, showing that about two-thirds of
the crew were Chinese. Â¦ â¢
Frye's^address Was largely technical,
but his areumerit was listened to with
close attention. â¢ . '
Several minor measures were oassed,
including bills appropriating $70,000 for -ft
public building at R<?nq, NÂ«v., and $200,000
for a. public building at Ogflftn. Utah: also
a bill restoring James G.'.Fteld- assistant
surgeon, to the active list of the navy.

of Edward J. Duncan, the last of thÂ«

on the ground that he could not get a

Tho allegations were made that out ot

lenged peremptorily or for causo In the
trials of William Buckley. Thomas Mo
ran and Charles Donnelly; that the
Metal Trades Association and the Em

deavor to securo a conviction, and that
tho minds of tho people in this city were
inflamed against tho men suspected of
Rice's murder.
The Judge denied the application for a
change uf venue, and Hutton then asked
that the case be transferred to another
department. Tho Judgo continued the
matter till to-morrow to enable the Dis
trict Attorney to file a counter afHdavlt.

The trial of Frank Morrisey and Martin
Flynn on the charge of assaulting Mrs.
Rose Kilboutn v;as resumed in Judge
Troutfs court yesterday. The prosecution
closed its case with the introduction of
the testimony of; Lieutenant of Police
Price of the Seventeenth-street nation.
Lieutenant i Price's testimony had little
bearing on the' case, it eimply covering
the manner in which the matter was re
ported to him, and the arrest of Morrisey
and Flynn. .
The nrst witness introduced by the ae
fexife was Mrs. Anne Murphy, who lives
in ihe neighborhood where the alleged as
sault occurred. Mrs. Murphy said that on
the night of December 15 of last year she
iound Mrs. Kilbourn trying to hcramhle
up an embankment near the Morrisey
home. Mrs. Murphy naid she was cross-
Ing the lots near the railroad track and
lje-ard uorne one yelling. She continued:
"I went over to iho upot from which the
cries Â«\idently came and saw a woman,
who, J subsequently learned, wan Mrs.
Kilbourn, trying to climb up the embank
ment, lief hat was oft and her clothvs
were dirty, and tÂ»he complained of having
a sore arm. 1 helped her up. and then di
rected her tn Mrs. Morrisey'n. as the told
mÂ«* ethe wl*hfd to go tnere."
MrÂ». i.r.r .-.in-ill Morrisey, mother of
Frank Morritey, watÂ« the next witness,

Connor Apologises to Sonrd.
I would siiBSeat tiÂ« the company, at all
events, that It nhouid meet more liberally the
demands of the city for tha extension of its
pipen and mains fop hydrant service, uu.i f Mr
ihÂ» placing of (he hydrants required frÂ»r fire

of iltÂ» municipality, and thÂ«t it nhquld d.ea| )n
(liia regard fulrly by the city if it expept* i,,
receive the fair trtatm@nt for whl@h It Ii een>
Hlantly Appealing,
I believe the hydrant rate of $2 r>0 entirely
tno high and recommpnd strongly that It b*
fixed at not to exceed $2 |>*r month for each
hydrant, or $00,000 for the year, thus making
tha company's revenue approximately $1,U1Q,>
7fift.
I believe If water rates shall be fixed upon
the basis herein suggested they will he fair
to the city and to the puhllc, and I further
believe that they will not Impone any hardship
on the company, or bu found at all unfair
tn |t,
Urges Lower Hydrant Rate.
Looking at tho varloiia vnluntlnns fairly, I
think thÂ»> etitlmnt* of the majority report at
$2.'i."nO,7OO too high by $2.">O.OÂ«). and tn no
*vent should It excerd $2fi,C>nn,nno. Five per

iinnuin, thun amounting to fl.S7n.0O0. Thfi
nmount of taxra to !Â¦>Â¦â¢ paid by the compnny
tho coming year Is a fixed charce of $2in,".V>.
For thÂ» operating expends the majority com
mittee ha* allowed $107,000. while tho minority
recommend! $130,000, both of which estimates
I consider exceHilve. With the abundnnt rain
fall of the pnÂ«t few ilays the peninsular reser
vclrs are ftlllnir up and the charge* for pump-
Ing water will be. materially reduced. Taking
into account that the company may vupply
Iteelf with cheaper fuel and power. I take It
that 9 Mo, 000 would .imply suffice for the com
pany> operating expenses.
Tho Mayor's message was thfn read on
Comtc's motion and afterward referred
to the commltteo of the whole. In his
report the Mayor eliminated entirely the
valuo of the compnny'n franchise in fix
ing a valuation, claiming that it does not
represent an invewtment of the company's
fumin and han been the result of no out
lay or expenditure. The report continues:
After Connor's report and ordinance
had been referred to tho committee
of the whole Mayor Schmitz stated
that he : had a report which he de
jlred to have read. Brundonsteln objected
to tho roadlnff, claiming that the commu
nication should go to the committee of
the whole.
"Without deprecating your Interven
tion," Bald Brandenstein to the Mayor. "I
call your attention to the constitution,
which places tha duty of fixing water
rates on tho Supervisors alone."
Tho Mayor asserted that he had a right

"The proposed ordinance glvfi the com*
pany 1140,000 for hydrants nnd an adui<
tlonal income of more than 1100.000," said
Braunhart.
Brandonstnln urged Braunhart to stick
to the facts and referred to thÂ« latter's
"frenzy of eloquence and oratorical tur

Connor'* Minority Report.
The Board of Supervisors held a very
lively session yesterday when ' the ques
tion of water rates came up for consider
ation, but did not arrive at any conclu
sion on the vexed question. Mayor
Schmitz presented a message on the cub
ject and Supervisor Connor submitted a
minority report, both of which documents
contained a recommendation that a ma
terial cut be made in the income of tho
Spring Valley Company, which* the ma
jority report fixed at about $1,067,291 14, on
an estimated value of $25,790,700. On this
basis the rates woulu be left as they are
at the present time and give the com
pany J>- bu per hydrant each month, to
the extent of $120,000.
The session was provocative of consid
erable display of temper from both fac
tions, and accusations that the political
gallery was being played to by ambitious
utltcials were frequently made. The ma
jority was led by Supervisors Comte, and
wrandensieln, wnilo tho minority had for
lenders Supervisors Hraunhart and Con
nor, both nf whom appeared to be much
hurt that their colleagues had not fallen
over themselves to arrive at the minor?
ity'B way of thinking.
The proceedings opened when Connor
announced Unit he tieblred to present a
minority repurt, .together with nn ordi
nance fixing the rates to ho charged to

I combined to give Emma Nevada
11 an enviable welcome, at: the Met
ropolitan Temple last night.
One of the best concert houses of the
season greeted the little diva' and her
clever confreres, and In some respects the
audience heard the most notable pro
gramme that the winter has seen.
It Is too late in the day to attempt criti
cism of Mme. Nevada's familiar methods,
but she was in excellent voice last night,
her wonderful pianissimo is *of BtllKthe
same inconceivably attenuated sweetness
and her coloratura work fluent as of old.
She received the compliment of a double
encore to each of her three groups of
songs and was her customary gracious
self in responding. The numbers were:
"Chanson du MyBoll" (David), with de
lightful flute aceompanimmt by Mr. Ma
quarre; "Bell Song <Dclibes); the en
cores, "Ave Maria" (Schubert* and "Old
Kentucky Home"; 'Mlgnon" (Gounod);
"Vilanelle" (Dell Acqua): encores, "Vo- >
gel im Walde." "Annie Laurie." and the
favorite "Travlata" aria to conclude.'

TWO VALUES.
fpESSlHERE arc two values to every purchaseâ^
W^ what it costs and what it pays you. Cork
liyyil costs 8 cents Â«a pound, but if you are drown-
l :i: vr^v ; ' : l ing half a mile from shore, its value would
be " not what you pay for cork, but what cork saves
you/' When a woman buys soaps she often con-
fuses the two values. She sees only what she pays.
She overlooks what she receives. Now a single
cake of Ivory Soap pays back from ten to twenty
times its cost in the saving it effects. Test h your-
self! Vegetable Oil Soap. Ivory white. It floats!
