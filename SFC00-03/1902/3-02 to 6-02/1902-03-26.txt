PARSONS. Kans., March 25.â Lee ; Wat
son, a 14-year-old boy. was killed to-night
by taking hold of a live electric light
wire. The boy was a member of a high
Fchool society which was initiating a can
didate to-night. Part of the initiation
was the application of this wire to the
candidate. Watson took hold' of it and
was immediately killed. Some of the iu-
EUlation on the wire had worn . off and
had been a plaything for the boys in the
day time for weeks past.

TO TURN OVER ISLAND. Â»â¢
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, March 2Â»-At a con
ference this afternoon between Secretary
Root and General Wood and President
elect Palma,. Senor Tamayo, and Senor
Quesada, representing Cuba, there "was
practically settled the important question
of sites where the United States will ac
quire coaling stations. The administra
tion had been anxious to establish sta
tions at Havana and Nipe'Bay, oh the
northern coast of Cuba, and Guantanamo
and Clenfuegos, on the southern coast.
President-elect Palma emphatically told
Secretary Root that the Cuban people
would never consent to the location by,
the United States, or any other foreign
government, of a naval station in the har
bor of Havana. They will gladly carry
out the terms of the Platt amendment
with respect to the sale or lease of sites
for coaling stations .in the Island, but
they feel that their capital; should belong
entirely to themselves- and that no. other.,
the Cuban flag should wave within
its boundaries. f
Scecial Dispatch to The Call.
A peace element endeavored to stop the
-proposed lynching, and a. committee con
sisting of Robert Patterson, banker; Dr.
Fleming; Charles* Dearborn, County
Treasurer, and other prominent citizens
asked the privilege of trying to get from
Wallace a confession. ' This was granted
and the negro was taken into the Court
house. After half an hour, the word went
out that rfce Courthouse doors were locked
and that the committee would try. to pre
vent a lynching. Immediately pandemo
nium reigned, hurled. at the
building until every , window; was broken.
Then with a telegraph -po!c: for .Â¦ a bat-,
tering ram the crowd- broke in : the doors
and Wallace was taken out."
Mayor Fred A. Babin made a speech to
DBAG THE NEGRO.
DISCOVERY OF. WALLACE.
Reaching the long depot platform she
fell in a swoon and lay there until dis
covered by one of the railroad m^n. She
was picked up and carried into the depot.
The police were immediately notified and
doctors summoned. . Under the treatment
of physicians Mrs. Miller soon recovered
enough to tell the story of her assault.
She gave a minute description of her as-
Failant. This description was recognized
by the railroad men as fitting W. H. Wal
lace, a Pullman car porter. Wallace was
found in the car of which he had charge
and was arrested.
Fearing a lynching Sheriff Farr decided
to take the negro to Pueblo, j When his
intention became' known, however, the
railroad employes declared that he could
,not travel by rail as they would refuse
to operate a train out of La Junta with
.Wallace on board; The Sheriff placed his
prisoner in a carriage and started for
Sugar City, on the Missouri Pacific, twen
ty miles north. At that place he was too
late to catch the train for- Pueblo and
then decided to drive throush^
Meantime an armed party had left La.
Junta to overtake the Sheriff. and prisoner.
The carriage was finally overhauled at
Patterson Hollow, midway . between
Rockyford and Manzanola. Sheriff Farr
made no resistance and Wallace did not
ask for mercy. The carriage was turned
back toward La Junta. Passing through
Rockyford the mob was joined by 500 men
of that town. La Junta was reached
about 7 o'clock, where thousands of men,
â¢women and children, many from the sur
rounding country.awaitedthem.
It was one of the most brutal crimes
ever committed in this vicinity, and the
aged victim was left for dead in an iso
lated section of the city by" her fiendish
assailant. Â¦ i
ATTACK ON WOMAN.
â JJrs- MHler. arrived las t. ntjpot- in a-tour,
ist car on train 2, known ip the Califor
nia Limited, running between Los An
geles and- Chicago. . The Strain arrived
here at 10:50 o'clock. Mrs. Miller got off
the train, intending to leave for Denver
at 3:25 this morning. Seeing a negro ir. a
Pu Iman porter's uniform she asked him
where the Denver sleeper was. He said
he would show her the car and she
walked with him through the railroad
yards for a considerable distance. Finally
she told her, companion she would go
back to the depot. He struck her on the
head with his fist, partly stunning her,
and then carried the woman to an ice-
hbuse near by. Â£rrp,yl.
By this time Mrs. Miller had recovered
somewhat and began to struggle violently
in her efforts to release herself. The
negro struck her several times on the
head and then to stop any possible outcry
closed his fingers on her throat until she
ceased her struggles. About 12 o'clock
Mrs. Miller recovered consciousness. She
was stiff with cold and so badly wounded
that she could hardly walk. She could
not utter a sound above a whisper, so
cruelly had she been choked. She crawled
back to the depot, following the tracks
so that she might not become lost.
LA JUNTA, Colo., March. 25.â W. H.
Wallace, a negro sleeping-car porter, was
lynched about 8 o'clock to-night in a cor
ner of the Courthouse square, being
hanged to an electric light pole by a>
howling* mob of 4000 people, who have
been hunting for him all day.' After the
hanging the body of the negro was
riddled with bullets. Wallace had been
kept out of town all day by Sheriff
Farr in an attempt to save him from the
mob. The prisoner made no resistance to
the lynching and died protesting his in
nocence. V..-'.',': '.' r ',
Mrs. Henrietta H. Miller, a gray-haired,
v.'oman, aged 67, who was going from Los
Angeles to Denver to visit relatives, was
brutally assaulted and outraged by Wal
lace in the Santa Fe Railroad yards here
between 10 and 11 o'c ock last night.
After reporting the bill on Thursday.
Chairman Hitt is -hopeful of being able to
bring it to early consideration before the
House.
In other respects the measure Is prac
tically the same as that agreed upon by
the Pacific Coast interests, with certain
amendments made from time to time.
The prohibition against Chinese sailors
on American ships was struck out, thus
permitting such Chinese sailors to be cm
ployed. The term Chinese was made to
Include all those who are Chinese by birth
or descent, leaving out the reference to
mixed, etc. The committee also struck
out the fee of $3 to the United States
Commissioner for passing on every case
under the act.
The committee struck out the clause re
quiring the United States District Attor
ney to be present at all deportation pro
ceedings and requiring at least two cred
itable witnesses other than Chinese to
establish the right to remain In the
United States.
The committee considered that the orig
inal bill was too severe in making It a
felony for any officer to neglect to retain
a Chinese person seeking admission and
the penalty was reduced to misdemeanor.
The original bill also subjected a vessel to
forfeiture in case it brought over forbid
den Chinese, but the committee changed
this to a fine of $2000 against the owner or
master of the vessel and forfeiture in case
the fine is not paid.
SEDUCES PENALTIES.
Â¦were In such insular possessions at the
time of acquisition by the United States,

and those who may be born there here
after."
FOB THE PHILIPPINES.
In addition^ the, committee framed the,
following new section, specially directing
the Philippine Commission. to put the ex
clusion law Into force:
"That the Philippine Commission are
hereby authorized and required to make
all regulations necessary for the enforce
ment of this act in the Philippines."
San Juan. P. R.. was struck out from
the list of ports where Chinese may enter,
as it was feared there would be a Chinese
influx at that point, owing to the lack of
sufficient official force to make careful
inspection. The other more important
changes made by the committee are as
follows:
Certificates of identification of Chinese
must be accompanied by photographs, at
the expense of the Chinese. In addition
to San Francisco and the other ports sps
cifically mentioned for the examination
and , admission of Chinese the Commis
sioner General of Immigration is author
ized to designate such other ports as may
be necessary.
"And the prohibition shall apply to all
Chinese laborers, as well as to those who
"WASHINGTON, March 25.â The House
Committee on Foreign " Affairs to-day
completed consideration of the Chinese
exclusion bill and by a practically unani
mous vote ordered it favorably reported
to the House. The measure has been
most carefully considered for more than
a month and it comes from, the committee
Â¦with quite a number of changes. The ex
clusion of Chinese laborers Is made com
plete, both as to the mainland territory of
the United States and all Insular posses
sions, including the Philippines and Ha
waii. The committee finally restored the
prohibitory clause recommended by the
Pacific Coast Senators .and members, so
that, as reported, it reads:

the effect of thtsr- Franco- Russian declara

the resistance which has lately developed
In China against the settlement of the
Manchurian question on 1 the lines required

admitted they had been temporarily over

Sir George Gouldie advocates granting
amnesty to the rebels, but he* Insists that

This, he declares, would go far toward
allaying the bitterness of the loyalists.
Sir George deprecates any attempt to per

English alone must be the official lan
guage and adds that the fact that prac
tically the whole of the rising generations

English will be*of great aid in this direc

of peace or war "rests in the hands- of

nies this assertion. To this contention
Balfour adds: Â¦ -Â¦.- r
"There> is no reason why all the Spion

To this General Buller rejoins that he

without- manipulation. , -. Â¦. Â¦
Yesterday, Balfour replied to General
Buller, protesting. against the latter's in
sinuation, and declared that the only
manipulation /which" had" been/- exercised
with regard to General Buller's dispatches
was the excision of a single sentence "criti

omissions from Lord. Roberts'; dispatches
relating to operations in Natal were made,
said Balfour, "solely for. the purpose, if

/ It is expected that .the fight will be
waged with all the bitterness engendered
in the suit last, summer... which- was re
plete with sensational "features, crimina

was based chiefly on the ; claim that the
true value of the stock was withheld
from the plaintiffs by Sesnon, Carmichael
and the other defendants. Questions more
of -law than of fact ; appeared .to be In
volved, and Judge Hughes, ruled against
the application for a jury trial on .\ the
ground that in any. event, the verdict of
a jury could be merely: advisory, arid, . if
opposed to legal reasoning, might be set
aside on arriving at a judgment* - Counsel
for Clark and Booth- have all along been
anxious to. put the contention; directly to
a jury for determination, and the suits
brought to-day will afford that oppor
tunity. ' . . Â¦ , . /:
It had been supposed that the two great
Republican., factions , in_ this city and
county, represented by Clark on the one
side and Wright and i Gillis on the other,
were in a fair way toward settling their
differences, but the suits filed to-aay In
dicate that there will be no reconcilia
tion and that Mayor Clark will fight
Colonel Wright and Gillis to a finish. If
this should prove the case there will be a
split delegation from Sacramento Co"unty

Gentlemenâ In justice to you^'I^eel it is my duty to send you an acknowledgment of the receipt of the sample â¢
bottlc : of Svvamj/-Root\you.so kindly sent me. I had been out of. health for the past five years with kidney and blad-
der trouble. Had our best physicians prescribe for me. They would relieve me for the time being, but the old com-
plaint would in a short time return again. . I sent for a sample bottle of Swamp-Root, and I found it did me a world â¢
- of good. Â¦ Since then I have taken eight small bottles bought at my drug store, and I consider myself perfectly cured.
It seemed as though my back would break in two after. stooping. I do not have the smarting and irritation,' nor do I 1
have to get up during the night to urinate, as I formerly did three'pr four times a night, Hut now sleep, the sleep of -
peace. My back is all right again, and in every way I am a new man:Two of my brother officers are still using Swamp- I
Root. -They, like myself, cannot say too. much in praise of it. It is'a boon to mankind.. We recommend it to all who
, are suffering -from kidney and bladder, diseases. ,-Â¦'"Â¦.
My brother officers (whose signatures accompany this letter), as well as myself, thank you for the blessing . you

for an exit. For a few minutes Archie
heard language that, try as he might, ho
could not get a "cue"' from and wisely
determined to keep under cover until it

Kid McFadden knocked out WilHe
Snailham at the Reliance- Club, Oakland/
last night , in the seventh round : s of a
scheduled : fifteen round bout. The blow
that put I Snailham down for more than
ten seconds was a right swing to the heart
region.,; The loser displayed . willingness
to mix It up from the tap of thsTgong,
and displayed cleverness, but the stamina
and experience of the sorrel-topped fight
er was more than Snailham could ' over
come.. Both had a large following in the
exceptionally large crowd in attendance.
E.J. Smith was referee. â¢ ' . ?V
Snailham - opened proceedings by. . plac
ing a right on McFadden's face and a left
on the ribs. They did hot appear "to wor
ry the recipient much and at the bell Mc-
Fadden was smiling and exchanging
punches with Snailham at* a rapULrate.
â¢ In the'. second .round Snailham Xrned
loose an assortment of upp'ercuts, but did
little damage to his opponent. McFadden
paid much attention to Snailham's stom
ach all through the battle and his kidney
drives weakened 1 the other man. The
third round : was a give-and-take one.
Snailham landed so fast and so often that
McFadden forgot to smile. He went at!
Snailham viciously toward the close of
the round and beat him to a standstill.
Â¦ '.-Both men were tired during the fourth:
and fifth rounds and . their blows lacked
power. Snailham ;scored a right swing;
in the sixth. In a mix-up he went down 1

They have been empowered to offer
Â¦ some of the funds of the association to
place the speedway in proper condition.
to the end tnat horses mayânot be injured
if sent at speed over the measured mile.
When the speedway was opened certain
rules were adopted intended to reduce tho
possibility of accidents to a minimum. No
heavy pleasure vehicles were allowed
there. Neither was It intended ladies
should drive over the course, and bicycles
were barred.
The members of the driving club say all
these are seen at tlm.es on the speedway.
They will ask the Commissioners to police
the course and keep these people away
from the place Intended originally for tha
speeding of horses hitched to semi-racing
vehicles. Â¦ ' : Â¦ - -V
The members of- the club are discussing
the possibility of holding a speedway pa
rade to mark the opening of the regular
driving season. Such parades are held
annually in New York and Chicago and
attract -wide attention. The horses and
vehicles are turned out In the highest pos
sible order and make a pleasing- picture.
The members of the club hope some day
to have a place arranged from which a
good view may be had of the horses in
.action on the speedway. This matter la
also to be broached to the Commissioners.

THE Sacramento handicap, 'over*
seven furlongn, .decided ut Oak
land yenterday, saw the upward
career of Green Morris' crack
three-year-old, Old England,
brought to a sudden halt. He packed 120
pounds and was asked to concede twenty
one pounds each to Hagerdon and Sweet
Tooth ahd three pounds more to Sister
Jeanle. The big fellow, ruling a 9. to 20
choice, came about as close to doing It as
Ruhlln did to walloping Jeffries. L*e
Jackson was his skipper, crossing the line
third as the signal gun was fired.
Jackson found It' necessary to crowd on
full sail, for Sister Jeanle caught a land
breeze and was within a cutter's length
of the first choice for two-thirds of ; the
course. Headed for home, "Longshot"
Conley, at the wheel of Hagerdon, sailed
by the favorite, passing the ref eree'-s Â¦ boat
first by a legth in 1:28%. Sister Jeanie
came in second and Ola England, with
the helm hard aport, third. Sweet Tooth
became becalmed, never figuring in the
race; â¢ Â¦
It may have been that the Morris three-,
year-old did not take to the going, which
was. made slippery by the rain, for the
crowd was disappointed in not seeing him
display that electrifying burst of* speed
shown in past races. Then, again, possi
bly the task asked of him was too difficult
a one. . . â¢
Favorites captured four of the events
run, precluding any chance for com
plaint .from followers of form. "Billy"

I has taken possession of little Ruth
H 11 McCann, aged nine years, through
their officers, H. McMurray, and
M,. j. White. Ruth , is the . daughter of
Mrs. Nellie McCann and stepdaughter of
Frederick McCann, a painter by, trade.
.The child, who now -lies at the Chll
drcnls' Hospital, attributes Â¦ her 'pitiable
condition- to the treatment she has re
ceived, at the hands of her mother, who
has herself admitted to the society's of
ficers : tbe truth of the charge of> beating
her : offspring. ,' . . v~ â¢
Ruth has not had the advantage of a
mother's care such as is the fortunate
lot of most chi dren. The little thing has
never known* a father's *caress or tender
watchfulness, and even her stepfather,
Frederick. McCann, though married to the
child's mother, six years ago,- Mad' never
even seen the poor, unhappy child until
two months since, at which r timeJie tod
his wife that she should have her child
under their roof to live and to mingle
with. their children, Alvin, aged- five
years, and May, aged nearly two years.
Ruth had .been placed in care of the
Beulah Home ana It was from that Insti
tution that she was brought by the
mother at her home at 224^4 Birch avenue,
off Van Ness. - Â¦. ' ... ' â¢,'â¢'
Her coming home, and admission to '.he
family circle, was the beginning of her
troubles,' for it would seem that Mrs.
McCann has lately been persistent in her
cruelty to Ruth. She = has -belabored her
with slipper and strap and stick until the
small, delicate child's body reveals the
story of It all in bruises and contusions
from head to- foot. Her. naturally thin
left arm is of abnormal size from injury
and to-day the gentle little .sufferer, for'
Ruth never mutters a word of resentment
pr tells of her agony, will be placed under-,
an anesthetic, when an examination will
be made to determine the true extent of
her injuries. It Is quite possible that thjere*
is a fracture of the arm. Even down to
the shins are ugly marks that are the
result ' of violence, and i upon \ the < scalp

The mining property was leased on Oc
tober .22,- 1!&3, to Daniel M. Burns - and
others, ami the lease expired May. 1, 1SSS.
The plaintiff claims that- the j lessees now
hold this possession illegally, requiring a
suit for ejectment. . ,
Suit has now been commenced in the
state of Durango by the Candelaria Gold
and -Silver Mining Company to recover
l>o*3cÂ»!8lon of the above property. The
Ocndclana Gold and Sliver Mining Com
pany claim that whatever right or inter

are now total y and finally relinquished
und Â«xtlnirulKhc-d by the act of Daniel M.
Burns and hlÂ« axaoclate* in applying in
3'ebruary. law, for a oÂ«w denouncement.
The plaintiff claims that - nuch action
threw back the title to the original Span
ish owner, and that Mark Iirumagltn an
thÂ« Bucceenor In Interest of euch Spanmh
owner was the owner of all the mining
property; that he haÂ» duly conveyed the
jpc lo the Candelaria Gold and Silver
Mining Company on June 10, J8S*7. . That
corporation 1>aÂ« now â¢ commenced ault
OKalnÂ«t Daniel M. Burn* and his a*Â»o
clatea to. recover poi;s*fl8ion of all the
property, .valued at many million* of dol

The plaintiff will apply to the court to
have a w-crlver appointed to take pofbos
elon of the dine and alt the bu lion com
ing from the mine. When a' receiver gets
hold of a mine in Mexico stockholders
five up all hope of dividends, for a Mex
ican receiver never, lets :any tiling go . out-
Bide of the family. The legal ' expenses
usually keep pace with the output of the
mine and as a general thing; are much
greater.
Tbe title to the Candelaria- mine is de
rived from the Laveaga . brothers by a
"contract xivlo,". or mining lease, made
by tiie Laveaga brothers onÂ» May 11, 1&S3,
with Green and Burson. The Laveaga
brothers/ by Â«Iecd dated Mazatlan, Mex
ico, on September J2Â», 1603, sold to Joseph
G. Rice, who was in the employ of Mark
Brumagirn, and said Brumagfm paid the
consideration through T. Lemon Meyer
of San Francisco. ; â¢
The purposes for which the corporation
Â¦was formed were to acquire the legal
o-vnership of the Candelaria mine,' and all
Its annexes, and all the property con
r.ected with the mines in the district of
Sau Dimas, state of Durango, Mexico,
now under contract of sale to O.iver. W.

to purchase from Oliver "W. Bird his con
tract of "sale and all his right, title and

mine and Dolores mine, and A. so all the

Mr. Harrison furthermore stated that the
Olympic C|ub was in a prosperous con

one and that the , organization now
counted among its - members the best'
known business men of the city. He said
a healthy athletic spirit pervaded the
club and that the members were receiv

spirit Of the club was to advance in every
department and add to its reputation of
being the finest and most successful ath

The Improvements will, only take place when
the funds of the club warrant. .At the present
Â¦jnoir.ent the' club does n6t expand any money
for the rmrchare Of the property. It is con
terctiiated that in seven or eight years from
now the club will build en additional wing to
correspond with the eastern wing. The addi

ball courts and a variety of other things that
are absolutely necessary to the steady growth'
of the club. : . - -

The difference between the purchase price
and that to be -paid for the property by the
club has been put up by certain members. I am
unalle to give their names or the name of the
gentleman who has acted so generously.
In discussing i the matter yesterday,
President William Greer Harrison stated
that a friend of the club had purchased
the property for the club, holding it at
its convenience for a period of ten years.
The net price is $35,000. The price paid
to the owner of the property was $40,000.
President Harrison said: " '
As soon as the leases held by store

now occupy the property have -expired,

REPORTS from Washington are to the effect
that the leaders of both parties in Congress
are doubtful what course torpursue with re
gard to the .Crumpacker resolution calling for an'in
quiry into the election laws and methods . of certain
States, and a report a? to whether or no they are in
violation. of the constitution. It is a harmless
sounding resolution, but there is no telling what'
would be the result of precipitating a debate upon; it..
The controversy raises a question of, principles
against practical politics. It is welt known that' in
many of the Southern States. the negro vote. has been:
almost totally suppressed by various forms of suf
frage restriction. Those States, however, < cpntinue
to hold in Congress. a representation .equal to that
which they would be* entitled to were^ there no.such
suppression of vote. . The question, then, which will
inevitably follow the.inquiry and the report 'called
for by the resolution .will be that of " determining
whether these States shall be deprived of representa
tion in proportion tothc suppression. of their voting
strength." . . .:
As a matter of 'principle the issue is quite plain. -
The constitution provides that when .the/right 'â¢; to
vote, is denied to any' of the male inhabitants 'of?, a
State, being 21 years oldand a citizen of the. United
States, or; is abridged except for participation in re
bellion or other crime, the basis of. representation
therein shall be reduced in the . proportion in which'
the number of such male citizens shall bear, to the
whole number of male citizens of 21, years of age.
That much is clear, but if,is v also clear, that the at
tempt to enforce the iule in this case wouW revivethe
old sectional issue- and drive the now progressing.,
elements of the Southern white people ; back :. again
into the ranks of Bourbonjsm, and thus, restore the;
old situation of a'solid North in conflict with a solid
South. , : ,
'The perplexity of. the leaders at Washington is due
to the fact that neitherside knows what would be
the result of an agitation of the issue, \ The Repub
licans arctaware that.the North desires ari ; end to
sectional strife, and is convinced that Booker Wash-.;
ington has found a better way -to the solution, of^ the;
negro problem than any; politician of the time; - On
the other , hand,- the Democratic /.'leaders are"
sure that the North would not support the South oji
the question if Â»it were oncei made anassue in- politics!
Each side, therefore.: is inclined to fight. shy of the;
measure. . The " Republicans have riot - been able to.
get a majority-of'theparty 'intoa caucus 'to "consider^
the resolution; and the DemocratsNn a 'recent cati-J
cus carefully avoided^discussing it. ,V.:tTi / ."
There is j a proverb in our language' which ".' says :"j

PRESIDENT
THE Crocker estate has decided to
erect.' a twelve-story . instead of a
ten-story hotel -structure at the
Â¦ corner of Powell and Geary streets.
The plans were drawn for a tw%lve
story building, but "It was origin
ally intended that ' the two extra stories
would be added at some future time, when
the business of the hotel would warrant
the increase." The managers of the estate,
after taking into consideration the gpeat
increase in the number of visitors that
come to this city .during the Winter, have
determined to have the additional stories
completed along with "the rest of the
structure. They have also decided that
the entire completion of the hotel at the
present time will save a world of incon
vfenience"',aX^*sofije subsequent :time,.:when
the'bulldlrig be full of guests! |
-The adauioi} ot .two. stories ,wUl mean an
increase [01 '- severity-eight rooms, . making
the total "number 433-:. The- original ap
proximate cost- of the hotel, $1,500,000, will
bÂ£ swelled to : SI, 690,000. It will be more
economical to erect the great hostelry to
its fullest height now while the mechanics
are all engaged and the scaffolding and
other ' apparatus is Vail in placÂ© thart
later on. ' . '- '
The work of laying the foundation has
been progressing most favorably and the
huge iron' crane will , soon commence to
swing- the ponderous steel oil the frames
work Into place. It was expected that
the hotel would be ready to register
guests In about. two years, but. the con
struction Qf two 'additional j stories will
probably lengthen the time somewhat.
One of the notable . features of the
.Crocker Hotel Is to be the lotmging-room,
.which Is. to.be fitted up In the most lavish
manner. .For a considerable time there
was a Â¦ debate as ,to .what J color , should
predominate in this apartment, but it has
.Inally been decided that it shall be done
In green marble, with Pompeilan red
panels and ornamented with dull gold.
Another conspicuous arrangement will be
the balcpny, which wijl overlook the
lounglng-room. Thi3 balcony will abut
from the mezzanine floor, on which will
be situated ;the. banquet-rooms and the
reception-rooms for the guests: at the ban

HOTEL. NOW sBEING ERECTED BY THE CROCKER HEIRS ON THE CORNER OF POWELL. AND GEARY
Â§ STREETS/SHOWING THE TWO ADDITIONAL. STORIES . PROVIDED FOR- IN THE REVISED PLANS, WHICH
WILL ADD NEARLY $200,000- TO THE ESTIMATED COST. . vVJ '">; : -"5'- Â¦
The State Board of Trade'that is now engaged in
devising plans and providing means for upbuilding
Northern California might' well give -some of its at
tention to this matter. The .various counties should
be urged to make a display in the city, and to fur
nish an ample supply of pamphlets or other forms of
literary description of their resources 'and their in
ducements for capitalists, home-seekers and tourists.
If the work be undertaken by co-operation it- will
cost but little to any one county, and if it be entered
upon promptly the display and the circulars can be
provided in ample time. The whole issue in a nut
shell is that we are to have this summer riot less than
100.000 visitors, and we should do what we can to
induce them to visit olher parts of the State and
either to make their, homes with us or become-per
manent consumers of our products.
It is scarcely necessary to point out that the mem
bers of the two orders represent . the best and the
dominant clement of the American people. Thty are
exactly the class of people from whom we -wish to
draw new. settlers for California, or. failing, that, to
win as new consumers of the products of California.
It will therefore be worth our while to' make special
efforts to provide in the city. an. easy opportunity for
â¢all of the visitors to see a comprehensive exhibit and
<iisplay of the products. of the State. â¢
It is now estimated that the Imperial* Council of
the Mystic Shriners will bring* to the city something
like 40,000 visitors. The session of the. ' Supreme
Lodge of the Knights of Pythias, accompanied,' as it
will be, by. the encampment of the uniform rank
and the session of the Supreme Temple of the Rath
bone Sisters, the woman's auxiliary of the Knights
of Pythias, will bring to the city upward of 70,000
visitors. These' numbers are riot merely guesses at
the unknown. They are estimates carefully made
from reports to the headquarters of the two great
fraternal orders, and mty therefore be 'relied, upon as
being approximately accurate.
Without counting minor conventions which, will
meet here this summer we are to have two on a scale
of the first magnitude. These are the Imperial
Council of the Mystic Shriners, which is to be held
here in June, and the session of the Supreme Lodge
and National Encampment of the uniform rank of
Knights of Pythias, which is to be held. in August.
Were there to be no other conventions than these
two the summer would be marked by a notable op
portunity for advertising the State among men and
women who arc here to sec it with their own eyes
and to realize the marvelous contrast it presents to
Eastern States, where the spil is less fertile and the
cJimate less propitious.*; .'
REDUCED railway rates and the pleasant cool
. ness of our summers have made San Fran
. _risco one of the favorite cities of the country
for national conventions. For several years past the
frequency and the magnitude of these conventions
have been increasing, tnd it will be remembered that
last year we- were virtually a convention city through
out the whole summer and entertained many thou
sands of visitors. It is now to be noted - that - the
coming summer promises to bring even larger gath
erings of visitors than last year, and it. is time \ve
were making preparations not only to entertain
them with hospitality, but with business sagacity, by
revealing to them something of our vast ,. resources
and of our many advantages for the investment of
capitalor the establishment of homes.

a movement once started will extend there can be' no

Dr. Van Shaick-said^of him: 1 . "St. Patrick's bap
tismal name- was 'Succoth,' or 'brave in battle.'
Even so he was: Not when trumpets blew and ban
ners waved and shouting men charged an enemy, but
on those, battle-fields where, one intrepid soul faces
the darkness- of a nation, and by ' its majesty and
power hurls back the hosts of evil and of ignorance
and crime.' On those battle-fields of our lives /.may
the spirit of this saint lead us'to : victory." ">'Â¦Â¦]'-

If the great nationi have any mission in the world
it ouglit'to be as examples to those who are back
ward and-weak. ,ThÂ£ spectacle of all these' nations
agreeing not to use poison, nor kill prisoners, â¢ nor
slaughter the defenseless in any "war, would impress
the many countries which are not permitted to sign
this treaty. The parties to it are all Christian ex
cept Turkey and Japan. But nearly all the Christian
nations of Central and South Amcrjca are exclutled
and the great empire -of China is not. a signatory,
nor is Korea. This may give rise to the suspicion that
the Christian nations-left themselves free to make in
human war on that theater toward which their am
bition; is largely looking. To those" who are pleased
to.$ee,them agree to,. be ..humane as war can. be,-be
tween' themselves, this treaty will be, gratifying. But
a far larger company; would have been better pleased
to see them agree to abstain utterly from acts that
revolt humanity. '- ';*.'â¢'' sÂ£%'jp Â¦.':.. '. ; :â¢
We confess some- impairment of ability to see' it
entirely in that light. \ If the treaty were '^restrain
ing agreement binding parties to.it to refrain -in all
cases from the acts \vhich it.prohibits, it would' de
serve the- praise bestowed upon it. But- its terms
make it binding ~brily between the contracting par
ties, which, are the 'nations, permitted to enter- The
Hague conference. Iri case of war between- two ; or
more of them the treaty controls, but it ceases to be
binding. if_ one of_tne '.belligerents.-; is joined .by. a
non-contracting partjy; Nor is it binding upon any
of the contracting parties at war with 'Â¦' a . non
contracting^ party. Now in our' judgment the high
est thought, of the. age is that' the acts prohibited
should not be used against any people at war. They
are acts abhorrent to. morality and humanity. Yet
the strong nations that, make this' treaty merely
agree to abstain am^rig themselves, but holtl them
â¢selves. free to employ poison, kill treacherously,
slaughter prisoners, niassacre those, incapable, of de
fense and do all the other nefarious things they are
not to use against each other. ,
This treaty is lauded as proving the superiority of
cur times, and in the Senate it was said that its rati
fication would place Uhis country in accord -with ; the
highest tliought of the age. Â¦ *
r' The important part of the -treaty is this clause: "It
is" prohibited'tb" employ poison or.poisoned-arms; to
kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to
the hostile nation or. army; to kill or wound .an
enemy who, having laid dowrVhis arms, or having rio
longer "means I of â¢ defense, - has surrendered Â¦ at discre
tion; to. declare that' no quarter will be; given; ito
employ arms, projectiles or .material ot a nature to
cause superfluous injury; to: make improper use of a
flag of truce, : the nationaLflag or 'military ensigns
and the enemy's uniform, 1 as well as the distinctive
badges of ' the "Geneva convention; to destroy, or
seize i the enemy's property, unless such destruction
or seizing be imperatively demanded by the ;iiecessi
ties of war." *'...' .- â¢ . . .-Â¦
THE.- new treaty defining what shall r be acts of
war, that has gro\vn ; out of the Peace Confer
?ence at The Hague, is 'well enough as farastit
goes.- The parties to it are i Germany, Austria, Bel

fipEsPEciiiEMS'
Of Physical Manhood!
No fcrm of athletic esercUe demands such
perfect phjslcal condition as prize fighting.
Every muscle In the body must be fully devel-
oped and suDPle. and the heart. luncs and
stomach must act to perfection.
Whether we indorse prizefighting or not. it
is nevertheless interesting to know the manner
by which men arrive at ouch phyBleal perfec-
tion.
Jame* Jeffries, the present champion heavy-
weight cf the world, and his gallant opponent,
Tom Sharkey,. in the gi-eatest pugilistic en-
counter that has ever taken place, both pur-
sued much the same course of training, and
the first and mostTnrportant part of this traln-r
ing was to get the stomach In condition and to
lteep the digestion absolutely perfect, bo that
every muscle and nerve -would be at its high-
est, capabilities.
This was not done by a secret patent medi-
cine, but both of these crcat pugilists used a
well-known natural- dlrestlve tablet sold by
druggists under name of Stuart's . Dyspep-
sia' Tablets and composed of the digestive fer-
ments which â¢ every -etomach requires for
healthy digestion. -. '
Champion Jeffries saya: "Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets prevent acidity, strengthen the stomach, ,
and Insure perfect digestion. They keep a man
in fine physical condition." Signed, James J.
Jeffries, champion of the' world. ,->.
The gallant fighter, Sharkey, says: "Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets remove all discomfort after
eating. They rest the stomach and restore it
to a healthful condition.. I heartily recommend
them." Signed, Thos. J. Sharkey.
The advantage of the daily use of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets is that they keep people
welt- and ward off sickness and are equally
valuable to well persons as - to the dyspeptics.
Another advantage Is that thesa tablets con-
tain no cathartics or poisons of any character,
but -simply digestive ferments which are found
in every healthy stomach, and: when digestion
is imperfect It la . because . the stomach . lacks
some of these elements and Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets supply it.
'-They, are no chesp cathartic, bot a- perfectly
safe and efficient digestive and the demand for
them is greater than the sale of all other so-
called dyspepsia cures combined. No remedy
could posBibly reach such a place in public es-
teern except as a re*ult of positive merit.
â¢ Full sized packages are sold by all druggists
at 50 cents, and the best habit you can possibly
form Is to take a â¢' Stuart Tablet after each
meal. They make weak stomachs strong and
keep strong stomachs vigorous.

voices the sentiments of thousands of wo-
men, and 'girls -who have tested the
strength making and life giving- virtues of
Paine's Celery Compound when she says:
"I | have | found Paine's Celery Compound
the best of all remedies, for the nervous
exhaustion consequent upon the arduous
work of my profession." Overworked wo-;
men lii the home, -'and weak. ~ languid
schoolgirls have found in Paine's "Celery
.Compound :the health and vigor it, so
strongly guarantee's.
Ida Mallory of Allenvllle, J1L, with the
view of benefiting young -girls, writes as
follows: "I was taken last spring with
what the - doctors called nervous disease
and- neuralgia, and three or . four doctors
treated me all last summer without doing
[me any good. My father started to travel
with me, and in. our travels a. friend told
me to try a bottle of Paine's Celery Com-
pound. My father bought a bottle of it.
and it helped me so I took two bottles
more, which entirely cured me. My father
has nervous headaches and he has been
taking Paine's Celery Compound, and
says it has done him five hundred dollars'
worth of good. , We are using the fourth
bottle . in our family, . and we consider
â¢ Paine's Celery : Compound worth Its
weight in gold for nervous and other
troubles." V â¢ >

NEW YORK, March 25,. â To-day'a stock
market began to reflect the expectation of the
coming triple holiday from Thursday until the
Monday after Easter. So long an interval of
no trading always prompts some closing out of
accounts. There is an additional incentive that
the narrow resources of the loan market may
lead to a flurry in rates' when the demand de
velops for loans to carry-over from Thursday
tÂ» Monday. .There were no immediate develop
ments of importance In to-day's money.mar
ket, but a number of important requirements
are to be met for the first of the month and'
the beginning of the coming quarter. These
requirements are known to be so considerable,
owing to the projects of Â¦ syndicates, that .the
available credits of the banks within the legal
requirement of the 25 per cent cash reserve*
would be more than wiped out In meeting
them. An extensive shifting of loans obvious
ly will be necessary to meet the situation. ,
Bankers express confidence that the steadiness
of the money market will not be disturbed, but
speculators on margin with borrowed money
know from costly experience that this, does not
necessarily mean . that their call loan accom
modations will be undisturbed at a pinch.
There was a revival of apprehension this mom
ing of labor troubles in the anthracite region,
which seems to be justified in view of the con
tingent disorder of the miners' convention be
ing committed for a strike unless certain de
mands are complied with. Reassurances on
the part of those connected with the coal in
terests that no strike was anticipated were not
wholly effective and ] there was some active
liquidation, especially In the Readings. The
issuance of injunctions against Western rall
roads forbidding rebates and rate-cutting was
not unexpected, but the reported determina
tion of the Interstate Commerce Commission to
hold a further and more stringent inquiry into
the rate question was a surprise and had a
cooling influence. Preparations for further
suits in State courts against the Northern Se
curities Company were to be reckoned with.
The testimony of the principals in the great
contest for control of Northwestern railroads,
which is being taken In a legal contest, is read
with great attention in Wall street and not
with altogether reassuring effect on sentiment.
There was a slump of more than 7 points In
Evansville and Terre Haute. The advance was
renewed in Colorado Fuel after some early
heaviness .and the stock gained 3%,, allowing
for " the dividend off. North American made
a further upward dash, and late in the day
the Kansas City and Southern stocks and the
Minneapolis, St.- Paul and Sault Ste. Marie
stocks forged upward without explanation. The
gains were the exception ; to the rule, which
was generally on the side of losses. 'Amalga
mated Copper was supported In face of the
postponement of the Anaconda dividend, and
closed with a small gain. There was heavy
selling of the Wabash debenture bonds, with a
loss of 1% per cent. Otherwise bonds were' ir
regular. Total sales, par value, $2,350,000
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

to the market by. the' packers, outside specu

of importation and even below, and that prices
must go up to get the business back - to a

Cool .weather has continued throughout the
gtate during the week, and light frosts have
occurred in nearly all sections. Northerly
winds have prevailed, and light showers have
fallen in all parts of the State.
Grain has made slow growth, owing to the-j
continued cool weather.. but is in excellent con- ,
dition, and a few warm, sunny days will cause
a rapid growth. An unusually large yield of
wheat and barley is predicted In the Sacra
mento and San Joaquin Valleys, and good crops ,
arc probable In all other sections. Pasturage '
is plentiful and etock are in prime condition.
Considerable work has been none during the
week in plowing, seeding, sugar beet planting
and cultivating orchards and vineyards. Work
in the hop fields of the Sacramento Valley is
progressing rapidly. - New potatoes and green
peas have been shipped from Alameda County.
At Pleasanton preparations are being made
for about 3000 acres of sugar beets this season.
So far as reported, the frosts during the
week were too light to cause material injury to
early deciduous fruits, nearly all varieties of
which are now in bloom and give Indications
of a heavy yield. Trees and vines are in ex- :
cellent condition in all Bectlons. One carload
of rhubarb was chipped East from Alameda

L. Lebenbaum. has been a prominent fig
ure in the commercial life of San Fran
cisco. In 1873 L. Lebenbaum and Jacob
Goldberg bought out the old grocery firm
of Kroning, {located on Kearny street,
which was established in 1850. The new
firm was styled L. Lebenbaum & Gold
berg. In 1881 the firm acquired the busi
ness of Bowen Bros., taking C. R. Bowen
Into the partnership. The firm name then
became Lebenbaum, Goldberg & Bowen.
In 1885* the partnership was dissolved.
Lebenbaum went: into business with, his
brother on Sutter street under the "name
of Lebenbaum Bros., while his former
partners continued as Goluberg, Bowen &
Co. In 1891 the ; two firms were consoli
dated under the name of Goin.oerg\ Bowen
& Lebenbaum, continuing until 1896, when
the partnership was . dissolved. Leben
baum & Co. resumed business on Sutter
street, the firm consisting of L.' Leben
baum, " S. 'Lebenbaum and Jesse Meyer
feld, while Goldberg. Bowen & Co. was In
corporated. The officials of the latter firm
are: Jacob Goldberg, ; president; Hugo
Keil, vice president; George W. Whitney,
secretary and treasurer, and Charles E.
Burton, assistant secretary. The firm has
three large stores, in this city and one in
Oakland. â¢ : ' - ' , â¢ '" . ' .
Jacob Goldberg, president of Goldberg,
Bowen & Co., and Hugo-Keil, viqe presi
aent, were Been yesterday and statea that
their firm would shortly. absorb the busi
ness of L. Lebenbaum &^Co. Goldberg
said: . ....... : ' ' .
"We have not tried to secure the busi
ness of Lebenbaum & Co. bur it has been
practically thrust upon us. L. Lebenbaum
was formerly associated in business with
me and we nave always been the best of
friends. The death ol his brother was a
great loss to him, and his partner, Meyer
reld, does ' not wish to longer remain in
the grocery business, which is a very
taxing one. This would leave Lebenbauni
alone and he does not feel like carrying
on the business single handed or look for
other nartners:* He offered us his .busi
ness, and though I tried to induce him
to continue/ he has firmly made up his'
mind to retire. Our firm then decided to
accept his offer and the deal will soon be
closed. 1 ' " 'â¢'.â¢Â¦
Hugo Keil, vice president of Goldberg,
Bowen &â¢ Co.', stated that. his firm would
carry 'on' the business of Lebenbauni &
Co. for some months, but' that when the
lease of the Sutter-street store expires
the patronage of Lebenbaum' & Co. will
be transferred to Goldberg, Bowen & Co.
In speaking of the matter,- Keil said: \
"Lebenbaum willremaln with our firm,
as he Is very popular 1 and- has a- large
personal following that is most valuable
in business. All the employes of Leben
baum & Co. will be given positions by our
firm." . . v . ,
The well-known grocery firm of L. Le
benbaum & Co., 222 to 224 : Sutter street,
will shortly go out of business , and its
large stock is to be acquired by Goldberg/
Bowen & Co. The retirement of the firm
or Lebenbaum & Co. will be learned with
regret by^the community, as it has al
ways enjoyed great popularity.,
j The reason for the. winding up of the
affairs of the firm is ' that L. Lebenbaum
does not feel that he is able to continue
the. business owing to increasing years. A
few months ago his . brother; a. Leben
baum, died ana the third partner, Jesse
Meyerfeld,* is. desirous, of retiring when
the partnership expires in a few months.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 25,
Twenty-five cents, or rather the lack^ of
it,, stood between D. Edward Collins and
Victory to-day Jn the mandamus proceed
ings he brought against City Justice John
W. Stetson to compel him to issue a sub*
pena directed to Editor G. B. Danie'.a,
one of his opponents in the suit against
the Oakland Encuirer.
Victory had been flying about Collins*
head all day. and Judge Greene seemed
about to decide that his position was
proper when lo! the opposition
discovered that Collins' attorneya/Messrs.
Henry Ach and J. B. Richardson, did not
tender the twenty-flve-cent fee that goe*
before a subpena is issued In the Jus
tice's Court and that an affirmative state
ment on this important point had not
even been made in the affidavits that were
filed. Â¦
Attorney Charles E. Snook made the
most of this, grave breach of legal eti
quette and soon had the wings of victory
hovering about the head of his client
rather than that of Collins, and â¢ Judge
Greene decided to dismiss the alternative
writ of mandate. He dismissed it with
out prejudice, however, so that Collins
will have a chance to file new papers,
which he probably will do in a day or
two. â¢
The neglect to tender the twenty-five
Cents was not the only technicality that
figured in this temporary defeat of Col
lins, though it was the most important.
One other was that his affidavit failed
to show that Justice Stetson had refused
to issue any subpena, which it ought to
have done in view of the fact that it had
said he had refused to issue the subpena
for this particular case. Still another pin
point omission was that the plaintiff had
not said that the Justice refused to give
any valid excuse for not issuing the sub
pena. These flaws Judge Greene said he
might have overlooked if the twenty-five
cents had only ' been tendered or some
mention made of it.
Attorney Snook let'Attorney Ach argua
all day before he sprang any of these le
gal points on the court. Then when he
saw that It was getting late he turned
loose his acquaintance with the law and
legal-proof papers and that put the prop
osition for a writ of mandate out of busi
ness.
â¢j Mr. Ach devoted most of hl3 time to. a
dissertation on the meaning of the words
"may" and "shall" in the legal sense.^ It
seems that the law says a Justice or offi
cer of the court or. minlsterferT officer
"may" or "shall" do a certain thing or
take a deposition, which Is equivalent to
saying that he can if he wishes, but if ha
don't wish he needn't. -Ach cited authori
ties to show that "may" or "shall" al
ways mean must. . ...
Of course there were other seductive le
gal arguments that sound well enough to
the practiced ear in the courtroom,- but to
the layman are quite enigmatical. These
took another part of the day. .
Judge. Greene was quite sure that Ach s
position as to the meaning of the word*
"may" or "shall" was tenable, and he
agreed with most of his other positions.
He was certain that it was the duty of a
Justice to issue a subpena. But he could
not overlook those fatal errors in the con
struction of the affidavits on which .the
application for the writ of mandate wa3
based
"It is my judgment," he said, "that It
la the imperative duty of "a Justice to Is
sue a subpena when he ia requested to da
so. He is a public officer and it is in
cumbent on. him to discharge the duties
that are imposed upon him. The law gives
litigants certain rights and states through
what officers the rights may be secured,
and the refusal of an officer to issue a
subpena is a deprivation of the rights of a
litigant." â¢
: Collins' attorneys were for making an
other application to-morrow, but later on
they changed their minds and it, will he
several days probably before the battl*
for Editor Daniels' deposition is renewed.
Transit {Company Secures Franchises
That Will Enable It to Carry
Out its Schemes.
OAKLAND, March '25.â The Oakland
Transit Company now holds franchises
that parallel the local lines of the South
ern Pacific Company in every direction.
The action of Town Trustees of Berkeley
in granting this company a series of
street privileges for its electric cars gives
the company the last links that are nec
essary in its chain of roads that is to cen
ter at the terminus of the California and
Nevada Railroad at Emeryville.
I The .most valuable . franchise granted
last night is that from East Berkeley sta
tion, paralleling the present steam rail
road operated by the Southern Pacific
Company along Shattuck avenue, follow
ing the steam line in the curve down Ade
\line street .to the boundary of the town.
S A short franchise is needed through Oak
land â¢ and - through a small corner or
Emeryville, and â¢ the Transit Company
will then havw $ line from all' parts of
Berkeley directly to. its proposed ferry at
Emeryville. ''Â¦"â¢" - .
The line down University avenue is only
a local line that .will accommodate the
two ends of Berkeley, but has no direct
connection with the proposed ferry. The
line up Hearst avenue and along _EucliÂ»I
avenue Is to give better facilities to .this
rapidly 'growing section, and ' the San
Pablo avenue extension is to meet the
franchises that were granted in Contra
Costa County some time ago for a line to
Point Richmond. These franchises are
now inthe posseslon of the Oakland
Transit Company. Â¦
The Berkeley Trustees Imposed a condi
tion that all the lines proposed be com
pleted in two years. ,- ;
, The Oakland Transit Company and the
Oakland and East Side Railroad will soon
be, in a position to , compete with the
Southern Pacific Company In- every sec
tion of Â¦ Oakland, . Berkeley.- Alameda,'
Fruitvale, San Leandro and Haywards. It
was thought that the greatest difficulty
would be in securing the Shattuck ave
nue and Adeline street franchises. Thest
having 'been granted, little opposition Is
.expected to the other \ pieces that are
wanted In Oakland and Emeryville.

These wer| the words of J. S.- Ranous,
an aged man of : this crty, just after he
had fired three shots from his piatol at
S. N. Harris, a veterinary surgeon, who,
Ranous alleges/ robbed him of his wife's
affections and led her to sue him for di
vorce on the charge of cruelty. The com
plaint was filed a few days ago In the
Superior Court, of this county.
According to Ranous, who was arrested
by Under Sheriff jFrancis Borgwardt and
lodged in the comity jail. Harris has for
some time past been meeting Mrs. Ka
nous. -The husband protested, but to no
avail, and ' to-night, seeing his wife and
the veterinary surgeon together, he fol
lowed them down Chester avenue beyond
Eighteenth street. - After walking to
within a few feet of the couple he opened
fire, i The first bullet went wide of its
mark and Harris started to run. The
next bullet passed through the fleshy part
of the fugitive's right leg. while the third
shattered the muscles of the left arm.
Harris says that he met the woman ac
cidentally on the street. Ranous is a
teamster, 53 years of age. ' Dr, Taggart
says that Harris' wounds are not serious
Mrs. ' Ranous will not talk of the affair.

Jacob F. Adolph for cruelty.
A pretty little- woman, whose soft dark
eyes wt re filled to overflowing with tears
caused by injured pride, appeared 'n
Judge Troutt's court yesterday and told
of her unhappy life with her husband.
Rafael De Moro, Jr., the scion of a Cas
tillian family connected with the early
history cf this State.
Mrs. De Moro, who is being sued for
dlvcrce by her husband, said she knew
nothing of the suit _until she was sum
moned to appear bef o're Judge Troutt. In
consequence .she was ill -prepared to an
swer her husband's charges. She intends j
contesting the suit, however, and it *s
probable that she will file a cross-com
plaint. â¢
Mrs. De Moro wept bitter tears yester
day in telling of the treatment accorded
her by her husband's parents, whoÂ«se
actions seem to have caused the unhappl
ness in the household. The wife said she
went to Berkeley three weeks ago to
visit her husband's parents. Mr. and Mrs.
Rafael De Moro, who occupy a beautiful
home at the corner of RuSsell street and
Telegraph avenue. Their treatment of her
during the early hours of her visit was
extremely courteous, but as night drew
near they changed, however, and before
she retired the coldness they displayed
made her feel miserable.
Kept Her Little Boy.
Mrs. De Moro had her little 14-months
old boy with her. and the grandparents
paid him a great deal of attention. The
next day she was ordered out of the
house, and the grandparents kept her
child.
It was after she had returned to San
Francisco the next day that she heard of
her husband's suit for divorce. She went
to her lawyer, she said, to see what legal
action could be taken to recover her child,
and after leaving- him she was served witty
a summons to appear in Judge Troutt's
court. - _
The husbandywho is the heir of the
De Moro wealth, is employed in a whole
sale house in this city. His father owns
several flats here and has large interests
la Berkeley property.
At the conclusion of the hearing Judge
Troutt awarded the custody of me child
to the defendant and ordered young De
Mcro to pay her $30 per month alimony
pending the hearing of the suit.
A spiritualistic seance was held *n
Judge Graham's court yesterday, in which
Attorney A. B. Treadwell, his client,
Emilie Olschefeki. and the latter's 16- I
year-old daughter took part. Mrs. OLs- 1
chefski is suing Frederick OlschefskI for
divorce on the ground of cruelty. The
trial of the suit developed the fact that
the plaintiff, her daughter and the de
fendant are firm believers In the com
munion of spirits. They are members of :
the "higher circle," witn the exception of Â¦
Attorney Treadwell, who said "he did not :
, possess sufficient enlightenment to enable ;
him to "have more than a knowledge of
water spirits."
Communes With the Spirits.
Miss Olschef ski said that, despite her
tender years, she had had three dif
ferent visits from the spirits of her
grandfather and grandmother. OlschefskI,
however, according to his wife, possesses ,
a. good deal of the material as well as
the spiritual in his makeup. His wife
testified that on several occasions he had
threatened to kill her and had frequently
beaten her. Judge Graham, after learn- \
ins that -spiritualism had nothing to do 5
with the divorce proceedings, gTanted the'
divorce on the material grounds.
Minnie Morse is suing Charles V. Morse,
an employe of the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company, for divorce on the ground Â«f
desertion. She charges that he deserted
her in January. 1901, ten years after their
marriage in Oakland.
Mary Bernal is suing Augustine Bernal
lor divorce on the ground of infidelitj'i
Â£he alleges that a few months after their
! marriage iie left her and went to live at
2326 Bush street with a woman whom he
introduced as his wife.'
Edward F. Vicary is suing Beryl V.
Vicary for divorce on the ground of de
sertion. He alleges that his wife left him
in June, 1S9S, one year after their mar
riage.
S. A. Clarke filed a suit for divorce
against Alice G. Ciarse yesterday. He
alleges cruelty, and in his complaint
Â« barges her with frequently beating him
with her fists and kicking him. They re
side at 1922 Page street.
Only a week ago a box containing the
last, or what is supposed to be the last,
of the old Welburn seals, was returned
to the office of Internal Revenue Collector
Lynch from the deputy In charge of the
internal revenue office in Los Angeles.
The deputy explained in his letter that
the seals had been lying around in a box
in his office for several years, that he had
no. place in which to keep them securely
and he therefore sent them to Mr. Lynch.
David D. Jones, thetChinese and Welsh
interpreter for the United States District
Attorney, questioned the prisoner. closely
and obtained an admission from him, that
he had sent the original certificate to his
cousin to be "fixed," the old photograph
having become very much worn from be
ing carried in the pocket since the, date
of its issuance,, which was April 27. 1*93.
It was issued in Sacramento by H. W.
Byington, Internal Revenue Collector.
Wong stated further that the certificate
with the new photo and seal mark had
been returned to him by his cousin,
whereabouts unknown.
Sent Certificate: to Be Fixed.
Mr. Sherrard had found that the orig
inal photograph which had been attached
to the Ah Kee certificate had been re-r
moved and a new photograph pasted. on.
Then the seal of O. M. Welburn, U. S. In
ternal Revenue Collector, had been useci,
half on the photo and the remainder on
the face of the certificate: The marks, oi
the old seal had been carefully obliterat
ed, ' and a. hot iron had been used to re
move the marks of the embossing. The
substituted photograph was clean and evi
dently had not beei#on the certificate for
more than a few months, the paper \being
white and unsoiled and showing no/signs
of wear, making the contrast between, it
and the certificate itself all the more
glaring.
Original Photograph Removed.
Several months ago Wong, got .into' a
dispute with one of his countrymen . in
Alaska and shot him with a revolver
through both lungs. Wong and his wound
ed victim were taken into custody as soon
as they arrived in this port, Wong on a
charge of an assault to commit murder,
and the wounded man to be detained as a
witness for the Government. After both
men had been kept in jail about three
months, and the Alaskan authorities havr
ing. shown no disposition to . prosecute,
the men were released, the wounded man
being given the certificate of registration
that was found on him. Clerk Sherrard
suspected something wrong with the
Wong certificate, which was in the name
of Ah Kee, and refused to deliver it,
pending . his â investigation. . Yesterday
Wong called at .the District Attorney's
office and was at once put under arrest.
Through the vigilance ot John 3.. Sher
rard, clerk in the office of the â¢ United
States District Attorney, the' existence in
unauthorized hands of a Government 'seal
for Chinese certificates of .registration
was discovered yesterday. The. discovery
led to the arrest : of Wong Chock, alias
Ah Kee, a highbinder, employed recently
in the Alaskan, salmon canneries. . -.'-'

Cline, .when, told of the latest charge
against him, was greatly agitated,' but de
nied any knowledge of the Ingersoll
death. She claimed that Ingersoll was
recently in*' Los Angeles..: \ Â¦
Mrs. Ingersoll, when arrested, said she
was ignorant of the charge, but she
faces a serious array .of circumstantial
evidence. She came to Phoenix without
protest and says she believes she will be
able to produce her , husband alive In

POSTUM CEREAL.
THE NEW WOMAN.
Made Over by Quitting Coffee.
Coffee probably wrecks a greater per-
centage of Southerners than Northern
people, fcr Southerners use It more
The work it does is distressing enough
in scree instances; as an Illustration.
Miss Sue W. Fairall, 517 N. 4th St.. Rich-
mond, Va., writes: "I- was a coffee
/drinker for years and for about six years
my health was completely shattered. I
suffered fearfully with headaches, and
nervousness, also palpitation of the heart
and loss of appetite.
"Hy sight gradually began to fall and
finally I lost the sight of one eye alto-
gether. The eye was operated- upon and
the sight partially restored; then I be-
came totally blind in the other eye.
"My doctor used to urge me to give up
coffee, but I was willful and continued to
drink It until finally In a. last case /of se-
vere illness the doctor insisted that I
must give up the coffee, bo I b'egan using
the Postum Food Coffee, and in a month
1 felt like a new creature.
"I steadily gained* In health and
strength. About a month ago I began
using Grape-Nuts Breakfast Food and
the effect has been wonderful. I really
feel like a new woman and have gained
about "ZZ pounds.
"I am quite an elderly lady and before
using . Postum and Grape-Nuts I could
not walk a equnre without exceeding
fatigue; now I walk ten or twelve with-
out feelings it Formerly In reading 1 I
could remember but little, but now my
memory holds fast what I read.
"Several friends who have seen the re-
markable effects of Postum and Grape-
NutÂ» on me have urged that I give the
to the public for the sake of suffer-
ing humanity, eo, although 1 djslike pub-
licity, you can publish this letter and my
name If you like."

' WE have for sale rights tor the States of Cal-
ifornia, Oregon and Washington for the beat
I Â¦ locked- wire fencu device ever patented. The
owner ofthe patent Is n practical ranch man
who has 200 miles of barbwire fence in the
. Panhandle, and who is now coin? over the
4 iiuiri- fence rystem of his ranch, putting In
1 the stays with this locked-fence device. The
device has taken like wildfire In the Eastern
fiUUes. The State at Iowa alone sold for
(10,000. We have /Samples of the device at
our orflcc. where it can be seen. The Â¦prin-
cipal advantage of this fence device is that
it makes a fence that is almost indestruct-
ible; no power can move the stays when put
on with our patent fastener and patent
wrench. If this deviee were adopted in Call-
1 iomla it certainly would revolutionize fenc-
ing. The fence Is cattle-proof, and by put-
ling in enough etays you can fence against
the smallest animals. The device can be useJÂ»
on ornamental fences or lor office wire work, j
The wrench and cllpg and â¢ possibly some
model* of the fence can be seen at the City I
1 Wire Works, on ' Main St.. between Seventh
and Eighth. Mr. Biescar, the proprietor.
Will be Klad to explain its use. MINING IN-

; The Bank of British North America and
other banking institutions similarly . sit
uated in this city , will benefit largely
from, a decision rendered yesterday by
United ' States Circuit Judge Morrow in
the case of the City and County of San
Francisco vs.' The Bank of British North
America.
The, suit was brought to compel the bank
to pay the taxes on its solvent credit3
for the year 1899-1900. The evidence taken
heretofore .was that the Board of Super
visors, sitting as a Board of Equalization,
added $731,000 : solvent credits, to the as
sessment on the bank, the ta* on which
would be $16,000. Judge Morrow In his de
cision yesterday took the ground that the
Board of Equalization exceeded its powers
in doing so, and that It should have In
structed the Assessor to make the addi
tion, the" duty of the Board of Equaliza
tion being simply to order, corrections of
the assessment roll.
Judge Morrow . ruled also on , another
point that , the law provides that the de
linquent tax list shall be certified to by
the Auditor, and the Tax Collector, which
was not done in this case. The court said
that in all cases in which Â¦ the Board of
Equalization added to the assessment roll,
such additions are illegal. This practice,
said the court, was continued up . to the
year 1900. Â¦â¢'.'. ' ..".Â»

Rudolph Herold Jr. yesterday attended
his last meeting of the Board of Harboi
Commissioners as a member of that body
and John D. Mackenzie, his recently ap
pointed successor, presented his' credent
tials and officially took his seat. -
Commissioner" Herold welcomed Com
missioner Mackenzie, bade good-by to his
former associates and as plain Rudolph
Herold Jr. was an Interested listener to
Commissioner Kirkpatrick's summary of
what has been accomplished by the com
mission since Herold joined it.
Mackenzie in taking his seat thanked
Mr. Herold and the Commissioners for
their kindly welcome and said that his
aim while a member of the board would
be to do everything in his power to pro
mote the best interests of the port. Â¦
Commissioner Herold welcomed the new
member as follows: , ~
Mr. Commissioner: I desire to congratulate
â¢you on your appointment as a member of this
commission, which Is considered by all thO3e
who are conversant and acquainted with its
duties and working to be one of the most im
portant and prominent in the affairs of .this
State. I am much gratified to be able to say
to you that upon assuming your seat as my
successor you will find the vast machinery of
this commission in the best working order.
There is each on hand, the credit is unlimited,
there is no annoying and worrisome litigation
pending, save a suit for alleged infringement
of patent, which is being, taken .care of by
the able attorney of the board, assisted by a
competent patent lawyer," and will therefore
not be a source of trouble to you; and in ad
dition to all of this, the commission is free
from the "slightest breath of Â¦ scandal. 'As the
Garden City has no harbor or water front, the
shipping and commercial Interests of this port
can feel secure that your undivided efforts will
be directed to the support and promotion of
the port of San Francisco.
Wishes Mackenzie Success.
In conclusion. Mr. Commissioner. I . extend
to you my best and sincere wishes for a. suc
cessful and prosperous tenure of office, and if
at any time you should desire, to confer or
consult with me on matters pertaining to your
new office you will find me ever ready to re
spond and co-operate.
Turning to President Kilburn, Mr.
Herold said:
Mr. . President : All that now remains to
bring my term of office -to a close Is the of
ficial leave taking of my associates and these
surroundings. This I do with sincere feelings
of deepest regret. During my entire business
life, which extends over a period of thirty
years in this city. 1 have at various times
been a member of boards and committees, but
never has any association been so near and
dear to me as with the commission I am now
about to part with. ' â¢
As San Francisco is my native city, it was
but natural that I should enter upon my
duties as a Harbor Commissioner with great
interest and zeal,, and which has increased to
such an extent as my term progressed that
it will be impossible Xor the mere expiration
of my appointment" to either eradicate, or di
minish it. I shall continue to be a close ob
server of water front matters,' and closely
watch the. consummation of the important
work now in course of construction, in tho
adopting of the specifications, the awarding
of bids and executing of contracts of, which I
participated In. It Is my earnest . hope that
when in the future my incumbency as a mem
ber qf the Board of State Harbor Commission
ers is referred to. the verdict will be "He did
his duty." This will be my. proud reward, and
I will always consider, that It. would' not- have
been possible for me to earn it If it had not
been for the able assistance . and ' support I
received at the hands of my associates, the
heads of the denartments and the rank and
file down to and including the humblest em
ploye to all of whom I now extend my heart
felt thanks. I desire to particularly thank
Governor Budd. who presented me with the
property and Governor Gage, who perfected
the title thereto. I also wish to Â» thank, the
press for its uniform courtesy and , the fair
treatment in criticizing my official acts.
In conclusion, my associates and friends, I.
with my best wishes for tho long continued
success and prosperity of the. Harbor Com
mission, will now bid you:"Good-by.' f
San Francisco's Great Growth.
Commissioner Kirkpatrlck then spoke
as follows: ; \ ' ; ..
Mr President: In accordance with. the im
mutable law of change, not to mention change
by immutable law, it becomes our . pleasant
duty to extend a hand of welcome and fellow
ship to our future associate:' to assure him of
our support and to ask his co-operation in those
duties which are so interesting to the indi
vidual and so important to the well-being of the
â¢state We have, however, another duty, as
well as a privilege, and that is to speed the
parting as we welcome the coming guest. The
great King of the Round Table has 6ald,"ThÂ»!
old order changeth. yielding place to new."
and, while this may be true of transient of
fjee. we would say to our esteemed friend and
fellow-laborer of the pa*t. who this day lays
down the tares of office, that there is another
order into which, with his consent, we hope,
we have initiated him: and as a member of
which we have graven his name upon .: our
hearts among that ancient and most honorable
order of, friends, whose term depends,' not upon
the statutes I in euch case made and provided,
but where the tenure of office is for life. There
Is one . matter of congratulation for our retir
ing Commissioner, and that is that during his
term of office Uhe shipping tonnage of San
Francisco has made the greatest growth of any
period in v its existence, until our city Is the
fourth seaport in" the United States, and that
the tonnage here is rapidly approaching one
half of that of the great port of Liverpool with
its millions upon millions Â» of- dollars .invested
In docks and pier*. . To say that so many mil-,
lions of tons of freight were handled In',' a
year conveys little information : to a mind un
familiar with the subject: but the fact that
tolln'have' been collected in the last year upon
sufficient freight to load four hundred thousand
freight cars cf fifteen tons each, and that , they,
if coupled together, .would . reach ' across . the
country In a solid line from San Francisco to
New York, ; will give some .:, Idea of.
the traffic of this great i harbor. ; To
meet the .requirements' of-' this .' trade
it has.- been necessary, to: strain . every ; re
trade it has been necessary to strain every- re
source, and upon Â¦ this subject Â¦. so vital to our
city and State there is no one who hae, or
could have, put more . careful - thought and
earnest' work than our . friend, ;â¢ Mr. Com
mipeloner Herold.^ainpnMACHBMMm0HCt4C
When, we think, that in addition . to all tb%
repairs , and . email Â¦ improvements . continually
. Two newspaper employes were before
the Grand Jury yesterday afternoon in
connection with the alleged raising of a
lund of $6000 to corrupt the Civil Service
Commissioners. Although their examina
tion was as unsatisfactory as far as re
sults were concerned as was that of the
police officers the previous week, it was
decided to put Civil Service Commissioner
Ohnlntus on the stand on . Tuesday next
to find out if he knew what he was talk-
Ing about when he made ' the assertions
that necessitated the so far fruitless in
vestigation.
Judge Cabaniss, at his own request, ap
peared before the Grand Jury to tell ho*v
hard the Police Judges are worked. . He
brought his dockets with him and showed
the number of cases he tried every day.
He said the other Police Judges did about
the* same amount of work, although some
cases consumed .more time than others.
The Grand Jury will recommend in its
final report that the Police Judges -follow
out the provisions of the charter and be
in their offices daily from 8:30 a. m. to 5
'j. m. ' . c
The congestion of traffic on Market
street, between the water front and Sev
enth street, during: the busy â¢ hours of
the afternoon was considered in the fol
lowing recommendation to the Board of
Supervisors:
Gentlemen: it is noticeable that ever
since Market street was bltuminized some years
Ego there has been a large increase of traffic
oyer that thoroughfare, and particularly in the
evening between S and 6 o'clock, when drivers
of empty trucks and express wagons, going to
Uieir respective stables, are in the habit of re
turning via that thoroughfare. It is natural
that drivers should take advantage of the best
r&ads, but as this great avenue of commerce is
Â¦used by the working women going from facto
ries and offices, and by business people gener
ally, this body deems it advisable and neces
sary in order to prevent injury and loss of life,
besides untcld annoyance to women and work
ing people crossing Market street or getting
on or oSC cable cars, that certain legislation be
enacted to tompel empty teams and express
Â¦wagons to use other thoroughfares at the time
when business houses are closing.
An accurate count made by two competent
men shows that on Monday, March 17, 535
teazr.s passed Montgomery street, going west
on Market street, between the hours of 5 and
6 p. m. As this indicates more than one team
every 6even seconds, making a continuous and
sometimes a double file of trucks and wagons
during the time when Market street is crowd
ed with human beings, we therefore urge and
request the passage by your honorably body or
an ordinance declaring that it shall be a mis-
demeanor for" the ' driver of an empty truck,
dray or express wagon to drive on Market
street, between Sansome and Fifth, between
6 and C n. in.
Accompanying the resolution is tiÂ»e
draft of an ordinace intended to do a\ray
â¢with the objections raised by the grand
jurors.
